            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                           After this there was a feaſt of the Iewes, and Ieſus went vp to Ieruſalem.
                           Now there is at Ieruſalem by the ſheepe-market, a poole, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Betheſda, hauing fiue porches.
                        
                     
                     
                        THe foure Euangeliſts doe write the hiſtorie of Chriſt, which is of 4008. whereof 3974 are briefly paſſed ouer in his pedegree beginning at Adam, Luke 3. So that there is 24. remaining: And or theſe about 30. heſpent in priuate, the other foure in his publike miniſterie.
                     This Harmonie was firſt diuided into ſixe parts:
                     1. From the beginning of the Goſpell to Chriſts baptiſme.
                     
                        2. From his baptiſme, which was his inſtallation into his miniſtrie, to the firſt Paſſouer, when hee began to manifeſt himſelfe plainly.
                     3. From the firſt Paſſouer to the ſecond.
                     4. From the ſecond to the third.
                     5. From the third to the fourth.
                     6. From the fourth to his aſcenſion.
                     This preſent hiſtory is the firſt hiſtory of the third part of the Harmonie, and of the ſecond yeare of Chriſt his publicke miniſtery.
                     The reaſon why wee doe end the firſt yeare with the former Hiſtory of Matthews calling, and begin the ſecond yeare with this, is
                     Becauſe there is no Hiſtory recorded after the former, but ſome circumſtance moueth vs to thinke it was done after this Paſſouer.
                     2. That circumſtance which is ſet downe, Mar. 3.23. ſheweth that ſtory to be after this Paſſeouer: for corne was then ripe, which was about Pentecoſt , and therefore after the Paſſouer, which was about March: and that is the meaning of Luke, when he ſaith, Chap. 6.1. the ſecond Sabbath after the firſt, viz. the Paſſeouer.
                     But here a queſtion may be moued concerning Mathew his entertainment of Chriſt, which ſeemes to haue beene preſently after his conuerſion.
                     
                        Anſw. If we conſider the circumſtances, we ſhall finde it otherwiſe; for Mat. 9.18 it is ſaid, While Chriſt ſpake theſe things &amp;c. namely, while he was reaſoning and diſputing with the Phariſees &amp; the diſciples of Iohn concerning companying with Publicans, and faſting, Then came Iairus the Ruler 
                           •
                        nto him. Now he came not till a long time after this paſſeouer, as appeareth by Marke. 5. and Luke. 8. as we ſhall ſhew when we come to ſpeake of it, and therfore it followeth that the feaſt of Mathew, vpon occaſion whereof that diſpute aroſe, was not till after this time.
                     But why then is Matthew's calling and his feaſt both

ioyned together by the Euangeliſts?
                     
                        Anſ. 1. There is no neceſſary connection.
                     2 It is becauſe of the matter, which, concerning o
                           •
                        e man, is alſo ſet downe together. So Iohn his impriſonment and beheading are put together: though hee were long time in priſon before he was beheaded.
                     This Hiſtory in generall ſheweth what Chriſt did at the Paſſouer in Ieruſalem the ſecond time of his comming thither: and it containeth,
                     1. A famous Miracle, from the beginning to 
                           •
                        he fifteenth verſe.
                     2. A diſputation vpon it, unto the end of the Chapter. In the Miracle are theſe branches.
                     1. The time. 2. The place. 3. The Party cured. 4. The occaſion. 5. The manner of working. 6. The manifeſtation of it to be a true Miracle. 7. The effects.
                     1. The Time is ſet downe indefinitely: There was a feaſt of the Iewes: whereupon ſome doubt is made what Feaſt it was. Some ſay it was the feaſt of T
                           •
                        bernacles, and ſome Pentecoſt. But to omit the anſwering of their reaſons, which themſelues confeſſe to be but coniecturall▪ it will appeare plainely that this was the Paſſeouer. Iohn 2.14. there is mention made of a Paſſ

                        ouer, after which Chriſt preached in Iudaea, and there 
                           •
                        e paſſed ouer the Feaſt of Tabernacles and Pentecoſt. For Ioh. 4, 55▪ Chriſt ſaith there were foure moneths to harueſt, which was about our Whitſontide: therefore Chriſt ſpake that betweene December an
                           •
                         Ianuary, and the feaſt of Tabernacles was in September: and ſo Whitſontide or Pentecoſt was paſt long before.
                     Moreouer the Paſſeouer is called 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     Now in that Chriſt went to Ieruſalem to celebrate his

Paſſeouer, we learn, That Chriſt was conſcionable in keeping all the ordinances of God, and that according to the m

And this ſheweth the reaſon why there was a poole there, viz. to waſh and water the ſheepe that were brought thither: which was done in a pious and religious reſpect to the ſacrifice of God, although afterwards through couetouſneſſe it grew to ſuch exceſſe, that they did ſell for gain in the verie Temple. And thus ſhould they that haue authoririe be carefull to prouide ſuch things as are fit in the Church &amp;c. for the ſetting forth of the worſhip of God.

Theſe were made for the reliefe and good of thoſe poore people, that they might be drie from winde and weather, becauſe they were to tarrie a great while before they could be healed; and according as the number of them did increaſe, ſo they builded mo porches. There were fiue porches. This is recorded as a commendable worke of charitie, for our imitation, that God hauing giuen vs abundance, we ſhould in thankfulneſſe to him, and charitie to relieue them that want, beſtow ſomething on the poore.

                     FOurthly, the companie which was there: which is deſcribed, firſt, by their number, ſecondly, their condition, thirdly, the end of their being there.
                     1 Their number is expreſſed, when it is ſaid that there

was a great multitude: which ſhewes, that in thoſe dayes they were many whom the Lord ſcourged, and laid his heauie hand on them; as may appeare by this, and alſo in that notwithſtanding Chriſt did daily cure ſo manie, yet ſtill many more reſorted vnto him.
                     This came to paſſe, firſt, becauſe of their owne ſinne, ſecondly, for the manifeſtation of Gods power and glorie now at the comming of Chriſt: thirdly, that it being a thing ſo common, euerie one might the better apply it to himſelfe, and take notice of his owne condition.
                     2 Their condition: their diſtr
                           •
                        ſſes are here ſaid to be of foure kinds; there were, firſt, ſicke folke, weake and feeble perſons, ſuch as were vnable to helpe themſelues, and ſo weakned through ſickneſſe, that they were paſt ordinarie cure; ſecondly, Blinde, thirdly, Halt, fourthly, Withered. all which diſeaſes could not be cured by ordinary meanes.
                     This is firſt, to ſhew that this cure was miraculous, ſecondly, hereby God would pull downe the pride of the Iewes, that euen in the middeſt of their glorious citie, ſuch a companie of diſtreſſed perſons was to be ſeene, as a ſpectacle of their own condition; which vſe we are to make of the ſicke that are amongſt vs: thirdly, it ſhewes the great goodneſſe and pitty of Chriſt, that he would come amongſt them. which teacheth vs alſo not to caſt our eyes aſquint vpon poore ſicke perſons, but rather to goe vnto them, if we haue any meanes of helpe; like the Samaritan.
                     3 The end why they lay here, which was to wait for the mouing of the water: and the reaſon of this end is in the fourth verſe, that by ſtepping into the water at ſuch a time, they might be cured.
                     Hence we learn, That they who were diſt
                           •
                        eſſed in body, had a care to vſe the meanes of recouerie. So we ſee when Chriſt did manifeſt himſelfe to haue diuine power to cure diſeaſes, how all ſuch as were ſick reſorted vnto him; and the reaſon was, becauſe they were ſenſible of their bodily diſeaſes. To apply this to our ſpirituall diſeaſes, this condemnes

vs, that we being ſicke and dead in ſinne, doe not yet regard the meanes of cure.
                     The reaſon of their wayting, ſet downe verſ. 4. contains the ſtory of a great miracle; whereof there are two parts, 1. the meanes of working this cure, which was, troubled water. 2 the meanes of attaining to it, viz, the ſtepping in.
                     In the meanes of working this cure, firſt, there was water vſed. Hence, to omit the allegories of ſome vpon this place, why water is here vſed, in generall we may learne, That God doth vſe meanes in the working of his extraordinary workes. Not but that he could doe them without meanes: but it ſo pleaſeth him to vſe them, for the triall of our obedience. and it teacheth vs to bee carefull, in the vſe of all meanes that God hath appointed for the effecting of any thing. Secondly, it was Troubled water. Now troubled waters are not wholſome, and good for cure as cleere waters are; but this was 
                           •

                           ••
                        aordinarie power, and that the cure came from him, not from the water. Hence the Doctrine is, That God can make any meanes powerfull for the effecting of that which hee will haue done; yea, though the things bee neuer ſo vnlikely and contrary: as wood to bring vp iron, 2. Kings 6 6. Salt to make water ſweet, 2. Kings 2.21.22. Clay and ſpittle to cure the blinde.
                     For the worke is only from the Lord, and not from the meanes: but God doth it to draw our minds from the meanes, to the consideration of a higher author. Wherefore we are not to tye Gods power vnto the meanes; or in thoſe meanes that God hath appointed, to diſpute of the fitneſſe and goodneſſe of them, as Naaman did.
                     To apply this to the meanes of ſaluation, it teacheth vs to conſider the ordinance of God, and not the weakneſſe of the meanes. The want of which conſideration made both Iewes &amp; Gentiles to ſtumble at the Goſpel of Chriſt, and not to r
                           •
                        ape that benefit by the miniſtery of the Apoſtles as otherwiſe they might.
                     
                        3. The Cauſe of the troubling of the water is here expreſſed to bee an Angel. Some reade the text, an Angel of God; but that he was ſo, is plainly implyed by this diuine and good worke whereabout hee was ſent. Many queſtions are here moued about this Angel; which ſeeing they are but curioſities and meere coniectures, wee will omit. In general we may learn, That God hath made theſe glorious Angels to be his miniſters for the good of men: ſo are they called miniſtring Spirits; and ſo we reade they were ſent from time to time to the children of God to comfort, to defend them, &amp;c.
                     But a particular reaſon of the ſending of an Angell here, was that they might know, that the vertue to cure came not from the goodneſſe of the water, but that it was a diuine worke, ſeeing that the water could not cure till the meſſenger of God from Heauen was come.
                     2. It was for the honour and glory of God to haue ſuch glorious meſſenger
                           •
                        .
                     3. This was a great honour which God doth to men, in ſending Angels to them; which ſhould teach vs to reſpect this honour, and by way of gratefulneſſe to honour him againe, by hauing our hearts filled with an holy admiration of Gods great workes, as Pſal. 8. and yet take wee heed of giuing this honour due to God vnto the Angels, a ſinne whereunto we are much ſubiect, Col. 2.18.
                     4. The Time when this water was troubled is indefinitely ſet downe, [at a certaine ſeaſon.]
                     
                        Queſt. A queſtion is made, whether the time were ſet and fixed when the Angel did come downe; as at euery ſolemne Feaſt, or on the Sabbath day, &amp;c.
                     
                        Anſw. There was no ſet time, as appeares, firſt, becauſe there were ſo many continually waiting for the mouing of the water; which they needed not to haue done, ſeeing they might haue come at the ſet time onely. Secondly, becauſe there was a ſigne giuen of the Angels comming downe, viz. the water was troubled, which needed not, if they had knowne that hee did come downe at a certaine

howre. Thirdly, the long time of their abiding and waiting here, and the word 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , tranſlated ſeaſon, implies no certaine time, but is indefinitely taken here, and ſo vſed in many other places.
                     The reaſon why this was vncertaine is, that they might wait, which thing they did. So muſt wee, ſeeing the Spirit bloweth where it liſteth, attend ſtill vpon the preaching of the Word, becauſe if one time we find not comfort, another time we may, ſo that we ought to come ſtill. The like muſt we doe in all things, whereof the ſeaſon is kept cloſe vnto the Lord, and vnknowne to vs. So much for the meanes of working this cure.
                     2. The ſecond point, is the meanes of attaining vnto this cure; which was Stepping into the water. And this is amplified, Firſt, by the Reſtraint, he onely was cured that firſt ſtepped in. Secondly, by the iſſue and effect of it; he was made whole, &amp;c. The water was the meanes wherby the cure was wrought, and they that would bee cured muſt ſteppe in. Hence the Doctrine is, That they that obtaine a bleſſing muſt vſe the meanes: Act. 27.32.
                     Now in temporal things al men are ready to vſe the meanes of obtaining any good: but in things ſpirituall, wee all ſtumble and faile. Wherefore ſeeing God hath appointed his Word and Sacraments the meanes for our ſaluation, we ought to be concionable in the vſe of them. And whereas many flee vnto Predeſtination, that they need not vſe the meanes, ſeeing if God haue elected them, they ſhall be ſaued; we muſt conſider, that God, who chooſeth vs vnto this end, hath ordained meanes to bring vs vnto it. Neither doth this vſe of the meanes withdraw our hearts from depending on the prouidence of God, but in a moderate vſe of them, our hearts are more lifted vp to the conſideration thereof.
                     The Reſtraint ſtands in this, that but one was cured at once, he that went in firſt: not becauſe God was able to cure no more, but firſt, to ſhew, that the vertue came not from the water, but was in the will of God. Secondly, to cauſe thē to ſtriue to goe in firſt. Thirdly, to ſhew, that this was not ſo much for

a corporall good as for a ſpirituall or to draw their mind to conſider of his power and preſence among them. We may here apply this to the meanes of ſaluation, that as there was here a ſtrife to enter into the water: ſo in vs there ſhould be a ſtrife after the Word of God, and an endeauour to follow it, as it was in Iohns time, when the kingdome of Heauen ſuffered violence, But the inſtruction that naturally ariſeth he
                           •
                        ce, is this; That meanes are not further powerfull, then God doth giue a bleſſing vnto them. So here, it being the will of God that but one ſhould bee cured, he that came in after the firſt found no helpe, the water was but common water to him. So the Sea that was a wall to the Iſraelites, drowned the Aegyptians. So 1. Cor. 3.7.
                     For although God haue appointed the meanes, yet he ſtill retaines his power ouer them. And without the will of God, the creature is neither willing, or able to doe vs good.
                     Wherefore in the vſe of the meanes, let vs pray to God for a bleſſing, and depend on him, not doting vpon the meanes, as Aſa did on his Phiſitions.
                     Yet further, in this Reſtraint obſerue alſo an extent: for although but the firſt were cured; yet whoſoeuer this Firſt were, and of whatſoeuer diſeaſe he were ſick, he was certainely cured, which ſhewes.
                     That God in beſtowing of his gifts, is no reſpecter of perſons. And the reaſon, for that the ground of his workes is in himſelfe; and from his owne goodnes, and not from any thing in man. Which may ſerue for an Incouragement to all to come to God.
                     The Iſſue, or effect may be conſidered, firſt, in it ſelfe; 2. in the Extent.
                     The former is; That he that ſtepped into the water was ſurely cured. Whence in generall ariſeth this Doctrine: That a right vſe of the meanes appointed by God, and vſed in that manner that God hath appointed, ſhall aſſuredly be effectuall as appeares by the example of Naaman: and the blinde man whom Chriſt bad goe and waſh.
                     
                        Reaſon is, becauſe Gods honour and truth is herein ingaged hee hauing promiſed ſo much. Wherefore wee may reſt on it.
                     
                        Obiect. But many heare the Word and reape no benefit by it.
                     
                        Anſwer. It is becauſe they heare it not as they ought. For nor he that went into the water, but hee that went in firſt was cured: ſo they only receiue profit by the word, that heare it attentiuely and reverently, and mixing it with faith. Hebr. 4.2.
                     Wherefore this is a rule, That if the meanes be not effectual, we faile in the vſe of them.
                     The Extent is, that they were cured of whatſoeuer diſeaſe they had.
                     
                        Doct. God is able to cure all diſſeaſes. Which is a matter of conſolation to vs whatſoeuer our diſtreſſe bee.
                     Now for the Manifeſtation of this to be a true miracle, theſe circumſtances may be alleadged: Firſt, that the water was troubled, and ſo not ſo fit for cure, as cleare water. Secondly, that this was wrought by an Angell comming downe from Heauen; which ſhewes it to be a diuine worke. 3. That the cure was reſtrayned only to that time; which ſhewes, it was not naturall, ſeeing nether before, nor after, it could worke the like effect. 4. that none but the firſt could be cured. 5. that all diſeaſes, whatſoeuer they were, were here cured. All which ſhew it to be a true miracle, and alſo a great miracle, and alſo a great miracle, the like whereof we doe not read recorded, and it is wonder that there is no where mention made of it but only in this place. By it we may conſider of the goodnes of God toward his people the Iewes; who were now without a Prophet, and ſo had continued a great while before the comming of Chriſt, to the end, that their mindes might be the more rayſed vp to looke vnto Chriſt. God therefore for a token, and euidence of his preſence among them, that hee was yet their God, and that he had not reiected them, giueth vnto them this extraordinary miracle, and that in the City of Ieruſalem, that all might the better take notice of it. 2. God wrought this great

worke for a confirmation of the true worſhip of him.
                     
                        Doct. So long as a People doe remaine the people of God, he alwaies giues ſome ſigne of his preſence amongſt them.

                           And a certaine man was there, which had infirmitie thirty and eight yeeres.
                        
                     
                     WE are now come to the 3. Part of this miracle, viz. the Party endured who is ſet downe indefinitely to be a certaine man. Secondly he is deſcribed his condition, that he was diſeaſed 38. yeeres.
                     In that he is only called a certaine man, it implies, that hee was a man of no great name or note, but that he was a poore man; as alſo appeares, in that he had layne here ſo long without helpe; for if he had been a rich man, he might haue hired ſome to put him in. Yet Chriſt makes choice of this man, to ſhew his power on him. Which ſhewes the freeneſſe of his grace: a point often noted.
                     Moreouer of all the company that was here, he made choice of one onely to cure him: which he did, Firſt, becauſe it was ſufficient for him to ſhew what he was able to doe vpon one as well as vpon many. Secondly, that it might be an encouragement to others to ſeeke vnto him. So that if no other but this man were here cured, it was their owne fault, in not comming vnto Chriſt. For we neuer read that he refuſed any that came vnto him for helpe and comfort. Thirdly, to ſhew that he was bound to none, but what he did, he did voluntarily, and ſo he chuſeth a poore man, one that deſerued leaſt.
                     Here we are to take notice of Gods dealing, how he beſtoweth his fauour but vpon few, in reſpect of the multitude: as in the Deluge. So of many thouſands that came out of Aegypt, two only entred into Canaan: of foure grounds that receiue ſeed, only one bringeth foorth fruit. See Math. 20.16· many come to the word, but few are cured by the miniſtery thereof. Neither let me here expoſtulate, and contend with God, for it is Gods goodnes that he hath appointed meanes, and that hee

doth make them effectuall to any. And ſo that may be anſwered to them, that Chriſt doth, Matth. 20.15. 2. The conſciences of wicked men ſhall tell them, that they haue not done all that which they might, and haue not vſed that ability which God gaue them to doe good. But for thoſe on whom God ſheweth fauour, who are conuerted by the word, this is, Firſt, to magnifie the goodneſſe of God, that but of a few it hath pleaſed him to make choice of them. Secondly, to catch them to honour God, who hath ſo much honoured them by a godly life, and not to be like vnto the multitude.
                     The Condition by which this man is deſcribed, is, that hee had an infirmity 38. yeeres. &amp;c. If the circumſtances be conſidered, we ſhall ſay that he was of all the company one of the moſt miſerable; Firſt, in that it is ſayd, he was diſeaſed; that is, as the originall ſignifieth, the diſeaſe had ſo long growne vpon him, and ſo much infected him, that he was vnable to helpe himſelfe. Secondly, in that it is ſayd, he was [in] this weakeneſſe; that is, the diſeaſe had ouer-whelmed him, and wholy poſſeſſed him in all parts. Thirdly, in that he found no helpe at all to ſuccour him. Fourthly, that to his diſeaſe there was added pouerty; and pouerty ioyned with ſickneſſe makes it much the more grieuous. Fifthly, The continuance of it, that he had been ſicke 38. yeeres, ſhewes the greatneſſe of his miſery.
                     
                        Doct. Chriſt makes choice of the moſt wretched and miſerable to ſuccour them: a point to be obſerued in moſt of his miracles. Which hee doth for the magnifying of his mercy both in it ſelfe, for the greatnes of miſery doth amplifie the greatnes of mercy. 2. And alſo in the apprehenſion of the party helped that he may the more highly prize and eſteeme of it, and the more gracefully accept of it as Paul doth, 1. Tim. 1.13
                     
                        Vſe. To teach vs that the greatnes of our miſery ſhould be ſo farre from making vs doubt, and deſpaire of ſuccour, as rather to miniſter to vs hope to be releiued of our miſery, being a fit obiect for Chriſts mercy to work vpon.
                     Now although this man had lien a long time in this diſeaſe, yet at length the Lord ſent him helpe. Hence we learne. That

though the Lord ſuffer men a long time to lie in miſery yet at the length he affordeth them comfort and releife. This man was ſicke. 38. yeeres; the woman with the bloody iſſue 12. yeares; the woman bound by Satan 18. yeares: the blinde man, Ioh. 9. till he came to mans age, as Verſ, 21. ſo the Cripple Act. 4.2. yet all cured. The captiuity was 70. yeres, yet at length they returned: 2. Chron. laſt. Ezr. 1. Abrahams ſeed in bondage 400 yeares, yet at length deliuered. So Satan hath beene let looſe now 600. yeeres Reu. 20.7. yea, the Church hath almoſt 6000. yeeres been in continuall warfare; yet ſhall at length triumph in heauen. The reaſon why God doth thus diſpoſe of it, is; Firſt, in regard of himſelfe, that his power, and glory, and mercy may be the more manifeſted: as Ioh. 9.3. and 11.4. Secondly in regard of man, for the triall of his patience: for the continance of a miſery doth more trie a mans patience then the Weight of it.
                     Neuertheleſſe, God doth ſend helpe firſt, to manifeſt his wiſdome care and prouidence, that he doth not forſake and forget them though he haue deferred to helpe them. Secondly to miniſter comfort to thoſe that haue long been in miſery, when they ſhall ſee others in like caſe comforted.
                     Vſe, is not to be diſcouraged, becauſe of the long continuance of our afflictions; but that we conſider, that their is ſome end or other, why the Lord doth deferre to help vs. And that God herein aimes at our good, as well as his owne glory that hereby he will haue our hearrs purged, our mindes weaned from the world, and deſire of heauen more increaſed: ſo that the iſſue and fruit of our affliction ſhall recompence the grieuouſneſſe of it. If this man had been cured, before he had not come to that knowledge of Chriſt and ſo to remiſſion of ſins as now he did; as Verſ. 14. wherefore we muſt wait on God with patience: Hab. 2.3. and vphold our ſelues, Firſt by faith beleiuing that God doth herein deale with vs as a wiſe God, and a mercifull father. Secondly by Hope to ſtrengthen our faith and to make vs looke for both preſent aſſiſtance in troubles, and future deliuerance from them.

                     From the Firſt, this Doct. ariſeth, That the ſight of our miſerie, is a motiue to ſtirre vp Chriſt to compaſſion toward vs. Which ought to miniſter vnto vs a further ground of patience and comfort in afflictions: a point heretofore often noted in Chriſts miracles.
                     From the ſecond, that Chriſt did only ſee his miſerable eſtate, but did alſo take notice of the circumſtances of it, or that he had ſo long continued in it, we learn; That Chriſt is not ignorant of the circumſtances of our miſery, the time, the kinde, manner and meaſure as Luk. 13.16. Exod. 3.7. This is another ground of great comfort that howſoeuer the greatnes of our miſery be vnknowne to men, yet it is all knowne to God, who doth accordingly pitty vs.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 6.
                           — hee ſaith vnto him, Wilt thou bee made whole?
                           
                              Verſ. 7.
                           The impotent man anſwered, Sir, I haue no man, when the water is troubled to put me into the Poole: but while I am comming, an other ſteppeth downe before mee.
                        
                     
                     THeſe words containe the fifth part of this miracle, viz. the Preparation to this miracle. How Chriſt prepareth this man, and the reſt there preſent, to the obſeruation of the miracle, it conſiſts in a conference betweene Chriſt and the man. Wherein obſerue, Firſt, Chriſt his Question. Secondly, The mans Anſwere.
                     Chriſts Queſtion is, Wilt thou be made whole? a ſtrange queſtion, may ſome thinke. For did not the man come hither for

that purpoſe? and was Chriſt ignorant of that, or doth hee ſpeake it to gall and vexe him. No, but for theſe reaſons:
                     1. To ſhew, that it was not in this mans power to heale himſelfe; that be did it not voluntarily; that he lay ſo long heere, but of neceſſity, becauſe no man would helpe him.
                     2. To worke in him a deſire of cure, and likewiſe a hope to haue ſome helpe of Chriſt.
                     3. To moue the partie himſelfe to attend this worke that he meane to doe vpon him; as alſo to moue the reſt of the company, and thoſe that were preſent to mark it. For they would thinke: Surely he meanes to doe ſome thing, that hee doth aske him this queſtion.
                     4. To ſhew indeed that he did take compaſſion on him, and did commiſerate his eſtate.
                     5. To manifeſt his owne preuenting grace, in that Chriſt ſought him, before he thought on Chriſt.
                     From all theſe doe ariſe ſeuerall inſtructions: as
                     1. That they who by neceſſity, by the hand of God, are brought into miſeries are eſpecially to be pittied; and not ſuch as for a little eaſe doe make themſelues miſerable, as doe many beggers.
                     2. That they who are brought to a ſight of their miſery, and a deſire and hope of comfort, are fit to receiue eaſe and comfort from Chriſt.
                     3. That Chriſt ſo ordered his great workes as moſt may take notice of them; and ſo we are to attend to the workes of God, that they be not lightly ouerſlipt.
                     4 That knowledge of our miſeries workes compaſſion in Chriſt.
                     5. that Chriſt thinkes of helping them, who thinke not of ſeeking of ſuccour from him. See Eſay 65.1. This is to be obſerued of vs, becauſe it is verefied in the conuerſion of euery one of vs. As in the conuerſion of Adam; God ſought him, when he fled from God: ſo it is euer ſince: And this is to the end that we may giue all the praiſe of our conuerſion to him.
                     In the Anſwere of the man we note 1. The title He giues vnto

Chriſt. Secondly, the ſubſtance of his Anſwere.
                     1. Sir: A word giuen to men in occaſion of ſpeach, arguuing, Firſt, a reuerence that he gaue vnto Chriſt. A point immitable of vs, becauſe Chriſtianity doth not ouerthrow ciuilty, but eſtabliſh it; eſpecially, this is to bee vſed when a kindnes is offered; for this is a ſigne of gratefulneſſe, and the contrary of Ingratitude; as of Nabal to Dauid.
                     
                     2. As this ſhewed his reuerence, ſo it argueth his ignorance of Chriſt, that he knew him not to be Chriſt; if hee had, hee would haue giuen him another title like Nathaneel, Ioh. 1.49. and haue deſired helpe of him rather, then ſhewed the reaſon why he was not helped before, as now he doth.
                     
                        Doctrine. Ignorance of Chriſt his Power, his Goodnes, his Nature and Offices, make vs backeward, and careleſſe in ſeeking thoſe good things at his hands, which otherwiſe we might receiue; Ioh. 4.10. for knowledge is the ground of all other graces, and without this we neuer ſeeke for them. Which condemneth the ignorance of men, and teacheth vs to labour after this grace.
                     2. In the Subſtance of his anſwer conſider, Firſt, that although this man had a long time lien here in great miſery, yet hauing now occaſion to ſpeake of it, he murmures not againſt God, he is not bitter, hee enuieth not those that went in before him, but only maketh a plaine narration of the matter; which ſhewes his patience, otherwiſe then many, who if they finde no helpe will fret and fume, accuſe both God and man, &amp;c. an example of ſuch murmurs: ſee 2. King. 6.33.
                     2. Marke the reaſon that ſhould moue him thus to declare his caſe vnto Chriſt, it was, Firſt, becauſe he had a deſire that Chriſt ſhould helpe him into the Poole. Secondly, for that hee hoped that Chriſt would doe ſo. So that all this while hee thought of no other meanes of cure, but of the Poole. Where hauing ſeen many euidences of Gods power in curing of other, his minde is fixed vpon it, only tying, the power of God vnto this water, and not conſidering that he was able to cure him by other meanes. So the Iſraelites, Pſal. 78.20. and hence this is the fault of moſt, That we tie Gods power to thoſe meanes

that he ordaines. Whereas we ſhould account of them but as of particular euidences of Gods Power in generall, whereby he is able to make other meanes effectuall.
                     More diſtinctly this anſwere doth ſet forth vnto vs. Firſt, the inhumanity of the Spectators and inhabitants about this place, that none would vouchſafe to helpe this poore man, ſo long and pittifully diſtreſſed to put him into the poole; eſpecially this being a place beſides the Temple: whether the Scribes and Phariſes, who made ſuch pretence of Piety, did dayly reſort: yet ſee what want of charity there was in them, which ſhewes their pietie was but hypocriſie. And we ſee that Chriſt doth many times taxe them of crueltie. So in the Parable of the Samaritane, Chriſt ſaith that it was the Prieſt and Leuite that were vnmercifull.
                     2. This ſhewes the deſire both of the man himſelfe, and alſo of all the reſt; that is, to be cured by the water; and for this cauſe, there was a great ſtrife among them to goe in firſt. The like deſire and endeauour ſhould be in vs after the ſpirituall meanes of ſaluation.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 16.
                           And therefore the Iewes did perſecute Ieſus, and ſought to ſlay him, becauſe he had done theſe things on the Sabboth day.
                           
                              Verſ. 17.
                           But Ieſus anſwered them, My Father worketh hitherto and I worke.
                        
                     
                     THe effects that followed vpon the miracle was, 1. In regard of the Iewes, who reprooued the man, becauſe he did as Ieſus bid, verſe 10. 2. In regard of the man himſelfe, who iuſtifies his action by Chriſts authority, verſe 11. 3. In regard of Chriſt, who firſt conueies himſelfe out of the way for a time, verſe 13. Afterwards meeting this man in the Temple, giues him direction how to carry himſelfe for the time to come, verſe 14. After Chriſt had made himſelfe knowne to the man, he goeth preſently to the Iewes, and declares who it was that had healed him, verſe 15. Wherein he

did well, becauſe, 1. The worke was good, viz. to publiſh the workes of Chriſt, and to manifeſt his glory. 2. His minde herein was good. 3. And the end, viz. to inſtruct the Iewes, who before he knew to be ignorant. In the ſixteenth verſe is laide downe a ſecond effect of this miracle, in regard of the Iewes, viz. Their perſecution of Chriſt. Whence in generall we may obſerue, that malicious and wicked hypocrites will ſpare none. Their reproofe of the poore man might haue ſome pretence to ſhadow it, they comming with a religious pretence of the Sabbath. And becauſe, hee hauing beene ſo long time ſicke, might bee ignorant of what ſhould bee done of the Sabbath. But now in that they perſecute Chriſt alſo, by whoſe authority this man had done it; and of whoſe Diuine Power th
                           •
                        y had ſo many euidences, it ſhewes plainly that the former came from malice, and not from any religious care of the Sabbath. Thus it is the nature of malice at length to ſhew it ſelfe like poyſon in a mans body, and fire that will not long lie hid. This appeares in Papiſts, who although they pretend Religion, yet their ſecret malice doth oft breake out in treaſons, rebellions, &amp;c.
                     Now this as it is laid downe as a ſecond effect, ſo is it alſo ſet downe as a Tranſition to the ſecond part of this Chapter, and an occaſion of that diſputation following: more particularly note here.
                     1. The effect which is two fold. Firſt they did Perſecute. Secondly, they ſought to ſlay Chriſt.
                     2. The Reaſon of it.
                     Here, firſt marke the Inference how this is brought in vpon the former. The action of the man was good and commendable, viz. to Preach Chriſt, yet therefore did they perſecute Chriſt. Hence the Doctrine is wicked and malicious, men may take occaſion from good and commend able actions to bring to paſſe many miſchieuous workes, as is plaine by Cain. Gen. 4.8. and 1. Iohn 3.12. and Iſmael. Gen. 21.9. et Gal 4.29. becauſe Iſaack was regenerate: and thus did the Iewes againſt the Prophets and Chriſt himſelfe.
                     Reaſon is, becauſe of the poyſonous nature in wicked men,

which like the Spider turne the ſweeteſt things into poyſon.
                     
                        Vſe. Not to Cenſure the actions of men, though ſome euils and miſchiefes are raiſed thereupon by wicked men, but to conſider the action whether it be good and iuſtifiable, and ſo the occaſion only taken and not giuen.
                     1. They perſecute Chriſt. The word is taken from Hunters, that purſue the beaſt and ſuffer him not to be at reſt, till he be taken. Which notably ſetteth forth the purpoſe of the Iewes, that they would bring him before the High Prieſt, and Rulers, and there accuſe him, and condemne him. &amp;c. The cauſe of all this, is their owne malice whetted on by ſuperſtition and ambition. Vſe is, that we doe looke for the like, enduring the Croſſe, and deſpiſing the ſhame as Chriſt did. &amp;c.
                     2. They ſought to ſlay Chriſt: note here, firſt the Extent of their rage in this word Slay. Secondly the Reſtraint of it, in this word Sought.
                     
                     
                        Doctrine 1. Perſecutors of Gods Miniſters are ſatisfied with nothing but blood, and ſo are they called blood ſuckers, and the metaphor of Hunters before vſed, fitly ſheweth this. So Ier. 38.4. 1. King. 19.2. Nothing would ſatisfie the Iewes, but to haue Chriſt crucified.
                     Reaſon and ground of it is as an immortall hatred and vnſatiable deſire of blood, ſo alſo a ſecret feare that wicked men haue, that they thinke themſelues not ſecure, till ſuch be taken away.
                     
                        Vſe is therefore, alwaies to look for one trouble after another till we be dead. So though much be paſt, yet ſtill to prepare for more: vntill we come to that reſt, which remaineth for the children of God.
                     
                        Doctrine 2. From the Reſtraint that they onely ſought, but did not effect it: we learne that. Wicked men doe not alwaies preuaile according to their deſires and intents: as here theſe Iewes againſt Chriſt, nor Herod againſt Peter, as he had againſt Iames, nor Iezabel againſt Eliah, nor the Iewes that ſought to kill Paul.
                     
                     Reaſon. For there is one that rules and directs all things, and hath appointed an houre, in which they ſhall be done: as

                        Iohn 7.30. cum Luke 22.53.
                     
                        Vſe. This is a ground of great comfort and encouragement to the Godly, that God will at length reſtraine and bridle the enemy, howſoeuer in his wiſedome for cauſes that he ſees good he ſuffers them to preuaile a while: this ſhould teach vs to truſt in God, to feare him onely, and to bee conſtant in our profeſſion.
                     The Reaſon is ſet downe, becauſe he had done theſe things on the Sabboth day: which the Euangeliſt layes downe not as if it were the true onely reaſon indeed, but as the reaſon which they pretended. Hereby ſhewing, Firſt their ſuperſtition, that they ſtood ſo much vpon the outward rites, that they neglected the maine workes of the Sabboth. Where we may ſee the nature of ſuperſtition, that it is buſied about ſhadowes, letting goe the ſubſtance: and alſo the danger of it, making men eager perſecutors of ſuch as doe allow of their inuentions. Secondly, their Hypocriſie that they did ſo ſeuerely reproue a man for ſhew of breaking the Sabboth; yet make no conſcience themſelues to perſecute and to ſeeke to murder, and that without a cauſe, euen vpon the Sabboth day, as it is probable. And thus alſo deale the Papiſts.
                     Ver. 17. Here note, Firſt, the Generalle Chriſts anſwere. Secondly, what kinde of anſwere this was. Firſt, conſider to whom Chriſ
                           •
                         doth make this Apologie: it was to ſuch as were captiouſly and maliciouſly bent againſt him, to depraue the honour of God in this good worke done to this poore man. Neuertheleſſe, in that Chriſt vouchſafeth an anſwere vnto them, we learne: Though Chriſt meet with wicked men. yet their malice could not make him leaue his goodneſſe. Now hee anſwereth them here. Firſt, in regard of God, that the Truth and worke of God might be iuſtified. Secondly, in regard of his Diſciples, and of this poore man, who now began to beleeue in him: to ſtrengthen their faith that they ſhould not be moued with the cauels of the aduerſaries. Thirdly, and of theſe alſo, either to winne them if it might be, or to make them the more inexcuſable.
                     Vſe. That this minde be alſo in vs, Phil. 2.5. to be good

and kinde, not only to the kinde, but to malicious and euill men. 2. Tim. 2.25. Rom. 12.21. this is a propertie of Chriſtianitie, nature teacheth vs the other.
                     In the Apologie it ſelfe, conſider we, firſt, the meaning of the words.
                     
                        My Father] this is ment of the firſt Perſon, it being ſpoken in relation to Chriſt. Wherefore he ſaith [my] worketh] that is, he ſitteth not idlely in the Heauens, but he is buſied and imployed in gouerning and preſeruing all things.
                     
                        Hitherto] from the beginning of the World, continually without intermiſſion vpon euery day, the Sabbath not excepted. For this is a reaſon, that therefore workes may bee done vpon the Sabbath day. That which might bee obiected, Gen. 2.2. is meant only of workes of Creation.
                     
                        And I worke] Here is a ſimilitude, and a likenes implied: as hee worketh continually and is blameleſſe, ſo I hauing the ſame authority, doe worke and am blameleſſe. Secondly, that I worke with the Father, and the Father with me; that which I doe, the Father doth; and what the Father doth, I doe.
                     So that here are contained two grounds of his defence.
                     
                        1. The Authority of himſelfe.
                        2 The condition of the worke that he doth.
                     
                     From the former, the Argument is this: God the Father worketh euery day, euen on the Sabbath; and is not to be blamed. But I am Gods Sonne, and haue the ſame authoritie with him; Therefore though I worke vpon the Sabbath day, I am not to be blamed.
                     From the ſecond, the Argument is this: Diuine workes may be lawfully done vpon the Sabbath day: But this is a Diuine worke, wherein the Father worketh, and I with him. Ergo, it may be lawfully done on the Sabbath. We read in the Goſpell of diuers kindes of Apologies that Chriſt vſeth, taken ſome from one thing, ſome from another. Here he vſeth an Apology only proper to himſelfe, drawne from great and high miſteries which he doth partly to confirme his authority, partly to confute the conceits of his aduerſaries: Becauſe the poore man had alleadged his authority for what he did, and they cauelled

againſt it maliciouſly, ſaying, What man is this. Chriſt therefore doth giue them to vnderſtand, that he is no man, but God, equall with the Father, &amp; therfore of ſufficient authority to command him, and to iuſtifie what himſelfe hath done, &amp;c.
                     Obſerue here a great incouragement to ſtand to the truth, ſo far as it is knowne vnto, becauſe God will ſtill vouchſafe more illightening and confirmation dayly. So Chriſt doth now reueale himſelfe manifeſtly what hee was vnto this poore man who before had ſtood for him.
                     2. This may be a warning to all captious and malicious men, though they may for a while make faire gloſſes, yet in the end their madnes will be knowne 2. Tim. 3.9.
                     3. Further here note, how this anſwer is made of Chriſt to preuent an obiection that the Iewes might vrge, concerning Gods reſting on the ſeuenth day.
                     The ſumme of this apologie is, a Demonſtration of the equality betweene the Father and the Sonne. The branches of it are two; Firſt, what the Father doth. Secondly, Chriſts likenes with him in that.
                     Of the Firſt, there are two parts.
                     
                        1. A diſcription of the firſt Perſon, my Father.
                        
                        2. A declaration of his worke· worketh.
                        
                     
                     In the Deſcription wee will ſhew, Firſt, how this relation of Father is taken commonly. Secondly, how properly in regard, of Chriſt. For ſo the word my, ſheweth a kind of propriety and peculiarity.
                     It is taken commonly, 1. in reference to all creatures by vertue of creation. So God is called the Father of the Raine. Iob 38.28. 2. In reference to Angels: Iob 1.6. and that, firſt, in regard of the Image of God in which they were created and ſtill remaine. Secondly, in regard of that ſpeciall loue manifeſted to them, that God vouchſafeth them to be alwaies in his preſence. 3. In reference to men, beſides the former reſpect of creation. Firſt, in a ciuill reſpect, in regard of their Office whatſoeuer their Quality bee. So Magiſtrates are called the Sonnes of God. Secondly, in a Spirituall reſpect; Firſt, by vertue of Adoption God hauing taken them to be his Sonnes· Rom 8. Secondly, by

vertue of Regeneration, he hauing begotten vs againe to himſelfe· Ioh 1·12.13.
                     2. It is Proper to Chriſt in a double reſpect, Firſt, in regard of eternall generation, as he is God eternall of the ſame ſubſtance with the father. Heb. 1.5.6· Ioh. 3 16. Secondly, As he is Mediator, God and Man, by reaſon of the perſonall and hypoſtaticall vnion of the two Natures: Luk. 1.32·35.
                     Vſes to be made of this, are, Firſt, That Chriſt being the naturall and true proper Sonne of God, hence it is, that we come to be the Sonnes of God. Ioh. 8.36. Ioh. 1.12. for whom Chriſt admits for his brethren, them will God admit for his Sonnes.
                     2. This is the ground of Chriſts Interceſſion; hee is Gods Sonne, and the Sonne of his loue. If God giue vs his Sonne, he will giue vs all things with him, he denies him nothing. Pſal. 2. 8. Rom. 8.32·
                     3. Note here the honour of the Saints, that wee are vnited and made one with him, that is, the Sonne. So are the Saints called Chriſt 1. Cor. 12.12.
                     4. This ſets forth the loue of God, that he did not ſpare his only Sonne; and alſo of Chriſt, that he would vouchſafe to bee the Sonne of man.
                     5. This teacheth vs our duty, viz. to kiſſe the Son, to adore and worſhip him, &amp;c.
                     2. The ſecond part was the Declaration of the worke and Prouidence of God.
                     
                        Doctrine. God who firſt made all things by his mighty Word, doth ſtill vphold, gouerne and guide them by his wiſe &amp; good prouidence: not like a Carpenter that builds a houſe and leaues it: or like the Oſtrich, that layes her egges, and leaues them in ſand to be trodden of beaſts: Iob 39.36. but like a mother that brings forth a childe and nouriſheth it. This prouidence of God is proued. Firſt, by the names and titles giuen to God. For this cauſe God is caled Iehouah; noting a preſence ſtil aſſiſtant, which name was not giuen him before the ſeuenth day after he had made all things; before he was called Elohim, a mighty God. Gen. 2.4.
                     
                        This name is compounded of the preſent, preterit, and future tence: as Reuel. 1.4 in this regard are many names giuen vnto Places; as Gen. 22.14. and 16.14.
                     2. By the effects of it: as in Iob the 38.39.40.41. chapters▪ all which, and the like are euident proofes of Gods prouidence.
                     If any obiect: That many good things hapen vnto the wicked, and many euill things vnto the godlie; and therefore ſhall denie the prouidence of God.
                     I anſwer: Firſt, That the ground of this, and ſo of all other miſorders is ſinne. Secondly, that the ſeeming good things that come to the wicked are indeed euill things and turne to their deſtruction. And thoſe euill things that come to the godly are indeed good to them, and turne to their benefit. Thirdly, Many things in this world ſeeme to fall out croſly, to the end that we might looke for that general iudgement, when euerie thing ſhall bee ordered according to iuſtice and right.
                     2. If it be obiected that it doth not beſeeme the Maieſty of God to haue regard to ſmall and baſe things!
                     I anſwer: The ſmallnes of ſuch things doth not ſo much debaſe his care and prouidence as the infinite number of them doth magnifie his wonderfull wiſdome and power in diſpoſing of them.
                     The vſe in briefe is, Firſt, To refute all Atheiſts and Epicures. Secondly, to teach vs to looke vp vnto him, to depend vpon him, to caſt our ſelues on him, to look for a bleſſing from him, whatſoeuer the meanes be that we vſe, &amp;c.
                     The Second point is, the likenes, Idenity, or Samenes, of the Sonne with the father. Chriſt here proues that his power and authority is one and the ſame with the fathers, becauſe the effects of both are one and the ſame. The Doctrine in generall is, That
                     Chriſt is equall with the Father. This himſelfe plainely expreſſeth verſ. 19. and it is manifeſt in regard of the effects which are attributed to both ioyntly, as Heb. 1.2. touching the creation; and to either of them; as the creation of the world to the

ſonne. Ioh. 1.3. and redemption to the father. So the ſending of the holy Ghoſt to the Father; Ioh. 14.26. and to the Sonne; Ioh. 15.26. and 16.7. this equality is plainely expreſſed. Ioh. 1.1. and Philip. 2.6.
                     
                        Vſe. 1. To refute all heretickes denying him to be God.
                     2. It confirmes the former vſes, drawen from the title, Father; and it ſhewes that he is to be worſhipped as God the Father. Heb. 1.6.
                     3. To ſtrengthen our faith in the maine point of religion, viz. redemption by Chriſt, that we may be fully perſwaded of the infinity and all-ſufficiency of his merites.
                     Conſider now the maine End and Scope, for which Chriſt alleadgeth this: he doth it, as we heard, to defend himſelfe againſt the Phariſees, who excepted againſt that worke which he had done on the Sabbath. His defence is grounded, Firſt, on his owne authority. Secondly, on the goodneſſe of the work. God worketh, ſaith he, euery day, on the Sabbath alſo, and is blameleſſe. But I haue the ſame authority that God hath: therefore I am not to be blamed.
                     Hence this Doctrine ariſeth; Firſt, from the proposition; that God cannot breake his Law. The Sabboth was not here violated, becauſe in this act, God did worke with Chriſt. The grounds of it are,
                     1. God is Lord of his Law, and not tied vnto it: for he gaue it vnto his creatures, not to himſelfe.
                     2. Gods will is the rule of goodneſſe, of lawfull and vnlawfull.
                     3. The abſolute perfection and goodneſſe of God, that hee cannot goe againſt it, denying or thwarting himſelfe.
                     Some obiections are made againſt this, as Gen. 22. Where God commands Abraham to kill his ſonne. and Exod. 12. Where the Children of Iſrael are bidden to borrow of the Aegyptians Iewels, &amp;c.
                     To theſe I anſwer: Firſt. That theſe are not againſt the law: for the former example, there was no fact done, nor any intent and purpoſe of a fact to be done, but was only a triall. In the latter, the word which wee reade, borrowed, signifieth

alſo to aske, or require. So that they asked of the Egyptians theſe and theſe things; and the Aegyptians gaue them vnto the Iſraelites freely: and God did ſo extraordinarily worke vpon the hearts of the Aegyptians, that they gaue them their chiefe thinges.
                     2. I anſwer. That God is Lord of life and death, to take life from man when he will. And as he hath power; ſo alſo he hath right to doe it. Now God forbids the taking away of life, when we haue right ſo to doe; God therefore may command any one to be the inſtrument of doing this. Secondly, So alſo had God an abſolute power ouer the goods of the Aegyptians, to to diſpoſe of them as he pleaſed. Beſides, conſider the equity of this fact; Firſt, equity did require, in regard of that ſore bondage wherein they held them, that they ſhould make them ſome recompence. Secondly the Aegyptians enioyed their labour; and this deſerued wages. Thirdly, They reaped much good by the Iſraelites, who builded them cities, &amp;c. And therefore it was iuſt and equall, that they ſhould be rewarded.
                     Another Obiect▪ is out of Hoſea 1.2. but to this I Anſwer: that it was but a viſion, and no fact: and the Prophet only declareth vnto the people, that thus and thus was done in a viſion: to ſet forth vnto them their eſtate, what they were like vnto.
                     2. From the Inference, or concluſion, ariſeth this Doctrine. That neither Chriſt can breake the Law of God; and that vpon the ſame grounds, as the former: ſo hee is ſaid to bee the Lord of the Sabbath.
                     
                        Vſe. 1 To ſhew vnto vs, that whatſoeuer Chriſt did in ſubiecting of himſelfe to the Law, it was for our ſakes. So Gal. 1.14. which is ſpoken in regard of a voluntary ſubmiſſion, as a pledge and ſuretie for vs.
                     
                        Obiect. But what if hee had broken the Law, had hee not been ſubiect to puniſhment as other men?
                     
                        Anſw. This is a ſuppoſition of an abſolute impoſſibility and therefore not to be made.
                     2. To teach vs, that what God and Chriſt did by the abſolute goodnes and perfection of their nature that we ſhould endeauour

to doe, in being pliable to his law, and ſubiecting our ſelues to it, becauſe it is agreeable to his will.
                     Laſtly, from the goodnes of the worke, that it was a Diuine worke, and ſo Lawfull. This Doctrine doth ariſe: Workes tending to the honour of God, are proper to the Sabbath.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſe 18.
                           Therefore the Iewes ſought the more to kill him, not only becauſe he had broken the Sabbath, but ſayd alſo, that God was his Father, making himſelfe equall with God.
                        
                     
                     IN this verſe is layd downe a violent oppoſition againſt the former Apolagies. The branches of it are two; Firſt, The manner of the oppoſition. Secondly, The Cauſes.
                     In the manner, note, Firſt, The Kinde of this Opoſition; they ſought to Kill him. Secondly, the Extent; the more. In the Kind, note this Doctrine, ariſing from it: that the aduerſaries of the truth labour to ſuppreſſe the truth, not by force of argument, but by perſecution. Thus did the old Iewes with the Prophets, caſting them into Priſon, and killing them, but yet not diſcouering any error in their Preachings; as 2. Chron. 24.21. So dealt Herod with Iohn Baptiſt; and the Iewes with the Apoſtle; Act. 4.16. So haue Heathen men and Heretikes alwaies done towards godly Martyrs; and ſo doe Papiſts where they get the vpper hand.
                     Reaſon hereof is; Firſt, The euidence of truth, which is ſuch, that it cannot by ſoundneſſe of argument bee refuted.
                     2. Obſtinaſy on the aduerſaries part, who will not be bea
                        
                           •
                        en downe.
                     This ſhewes a difference betweene thoſe that ſeeke for truth in ſincerity, and ſuch as are of a gaine-ſaying, and cauilling ſpirit. The one ſeekes the good of their aduerſaries that they might know the truth as well as themſelues, which makes them to deale with all meekenes and gentleneſſe; vnleſſe it be towards ſuch as are willfull, and obſtinate in fundamentall points of Religion; ſuch indeed are brought to puniſhment:

but yet after many warnings, admonitions, and exhortations. But the other aiming only at victory and conqueſt, vſe all violence; and if not in deeds, yet in words; vſing all violent and and bitter words, ſtriuing only to maintaine a cauſe. As we ſee that Papiſts, Lutherans, Anabaptiſts, &amp;c. doe in their writings: and generally the more men ſwerue from the truth, the more they goe from gentlenes, growing in heat and choler, to be bitter and violent.
                     The Extent is, in theſe words. The more.] why? becauſe Chriſt had more euidently mantained that which he did, and had now clearely manifeſted himſelfe.
                     
                        Doct. The more euidence is giuen to the truth by the defendors of it, the more violent opposition is made againſt it by the enemies thereof. When Chriſt had wrought that great miracle of raiſing vp Lazarus. We ſee how the Iewes perſecuted him; Ioh. 11.47, 48, 53.
                     But eſpecially, when he roſe againe from the dead, how doe they beſtirre themſelues; by ſpreading abroad lies, by bribes, &amp;c. Mat. 28.12, 13. This makes Papiſts more to hate Proteſtants, then any other kindes of Religion whatſoeuer; becauſe of that cleare light which they bring againſt their Idolatry. And here note a further difference betweene a meeke ſpirit and a contradicting ſpirit; the one conſiders the force of argument, and if it be a ſure, a certaine ground they yeeld vnto it, albeit their Opinion were otherwiſe before; as Peter Act. 10.28. the other only labour to maintaine a cauſe.
                     The Cauſes are twofold: partly old matter; becauſe he had broken the Sabbath, which is not to be taken ſimply, but in reference to their conceit, who made this a pretence. Partly new matter; becauſe he made himſelfe equall to God.
                     Thus theſe aduerſaries, though they haue new matter yet, they let not go their old hold. Euen as the Papiſts that ſtilbring their old threadbare arguments, beſides their new deuiſes.
                     The new matter that they conceit to haue againſt him, is, that he blaſphemed: Firſt, In that hee made God his Father, Secondly in making himſelfe equall to God.
                     But before we come to their erroneous conceits, let vs firſt

obſerue ſome ſound and orthodoxall points, which the Iewes gathered from the words of Chriſt, whereby we ſhall ſee, how they vnderſtood his meaning aright. The
                     1. Is, That Chriſt did account God his own Proper Father 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , and not a common Father, as he is to other creatures.
                     2. That he was equall with God. And ſo though they were malicious enemies of Chriſt yet more truly did they obſerue and conceiue his meaning, then many heretickes haue done.
                     3. A third is this▪ That he that vniuſtly makes himſelfe the ſonne of God is worthy of death. This is a ſound collection and herein they go beyond the Papiſts in tolerating the Pope, who maketh himſelfe God, taking vnto him his Titles, Attributes, and Authority.
                     All this ſerues to amplifie and aggrauate their malice, that thus perceiuing his meaning, and not being able to charge him with vntruth and colluſion that he had at any time vſed, yet notwithſtanding they would without any further triall, raſhly accuſe and condemne him of blaſphemie, and ſeeke to ſlay him. Worſe then Pilate, who hearing that Chriſt neuer ſayd but truth, was afraid to meddle with Chriſt, when hee heard that he called himſelfe the Sonne of God. Iohn 19.7.8.13.
                     
                        Doctrine. Malice blinds mens eyes that they cannot ſearch into the truth: but makes them condemne at the firſt whatſoeuer they thinke will make againſt them. As doe the Papiſts.
                     Vſe, is to teach vs not to condemne any thing without full triall.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 19.
                           Then anſwered Ieſus, and ſayd vnto them, Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, The Sonne can doe nothing of himſelfe, but what he ſeeth the Father doe: For whatſoeuer things he doth theſe alſo doth the Sonne likewiſe.
                        
                     
                     IN this verſe beginneth a confirmation of the former Apology, with the Amplification of it vnto the end of the chapter. The whole Summe of all, is to ſhew, that Chriſt is the true Sonne of God, equall with the Father. We may obſerue in it three parts.
                     1. Certaine Effects for the proofe of it, from the 19. to the 31. verſe.
                     2. Certaine Teſtimonies to confirme it, from the 31. to the 40.
                     3. A reproofe of the Incredulity of the Iewes, from the 40. verſe to the end.
                     The Effects whereby his Deitie is proued are, Firſt, Generally propounded. Verſ. 19. Secondly, Generally Repeated verſe 30. And as they are generally propounded, ſo are they particularly confirmed from the 21. verſ to the 30.
                     The Effects verſ. 19. are laid downe, Firſt, Negatiuely. Secondly, Affirmatiuely. The ſonn
                              •
                            can doe nothing without the father. And what the father doth, that doth the ſonne. But before we come to handle theſe points, ſome generall inſtructions are to be deliuered out of the words before going.
                     1. In that Chriſt anſwered againe, we learne, That Chriſt ſtill continues in his goodnes, though his enemies were more and more incenſed and inraged againſt him.
                     
                        Vſe is, as for our Imitation; ſo for our comfort, that if Chriſt be of ſo long patience towards his enemies, how much towards them that loue him, though they offend often againſt him.
                     2. The Preface declares, Firſt, the truth of the matter, Verily, verily. Secondly, the authority of him that ſpeaketh it, I say vnto you.
                     
                     
                        Verily, &amp;c.] This ſhewes, that it was not a matter that fell from him by chance, but that it was ſuch a truth hee would

ſtaid to it; a truth whereof he was ſure and certaine.
                     
                        I ſay vnto you.] a ſpeech proper to Chriſt, who being the Sonne of God, might auouch a thing vpon his owne authority. Furthermore, theis ſhewes Chriſts earneſtneſſe towards the good of theſe men And Secondly, that was a matter of great weight and moment. Thirdly, that he was ſo farre from ſhrinking from the truth, becauſe of their oppoſition, that hee is the more earneſt in ſtanding for it. Which ſhould teach vs to doe the like.
                     Now come we to the meaning of the words·
                     
                        The Sonne] the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, &amp;c.
                     Of himſelfe] alone without his father, as ſeparate from him, hauing no communication with him.
                     
                        Can doe nothing] this implies not any reſtraint, or inability, but an abſolute neceſſity and impoſſibility that the Son ſhould doe any thing, which the Father doth not. So that this Implies a vnion in nature, and Eſſence; becauſe though both haue ability of themſelues, yet neither can doe any thing without the other. Whereas in nature, things therefore cannot worke one without the other, becauſe they haue not ability in themſelues, without the helpe of one another.
                     
                        But what he ſeeth, &amp;c.] This is ſpoken according to the capacity of the Iewes, it implies a taking of councell together, as Ioh. 1.18. Gen. 1.26. nor is it a word of ſpeculation of Efficacy, implying a communication of knowledge.
                     
                        For whatſoeuer thinges, &amp;c.] Here are three points
                     1. The Sonne doth not only nothing alone without the Father, but doth ioyntly with the Father what the Father doth.
                     2. That this communication is not in ſome things, but in all things.
                     3. That as the Sonne doth the ſame things, ſo he doth them after the ſame manner, by the ſame authority, to the ſame end &amp;c. [
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , likewiſe.]
                     So that here in this 19. Ve. is contained a proof of the equality of the Sonne with the Father, becauſe the ioynt effects of both are one and the ſame.
                     
                        The myſtery and maine point here to be noted is,
                     That Chriſt is true God of the ſame eſſence with the Father, and euery way equall vnto him. Becauſe, Firſt, he can doe nothing of himſelfe without the Father, but as he doth all things originally from the Father, ſo he doth them ioyntly with him. Secondly, yea he can doe nothing: implying a neceſſity and impoſſibility. Thirdly, becauſe he is in the boſom of the Father. Seeing [ſaue what he ſeeth] the councels of his father and communicating him, which none but Chriſt hath done. Fourthly, againe what the Father doth, that he cannot but do. Fiftly, becauſe this concurrence is in all things. Sixthly and laſtly, hee doth euery thing after the ſame manner with the Father. All theſe ſhew an Identity, Samenes and Equality, between Chriſt and God the Father. Some illuſtrate this by examples, as if a thing burne, and cannot chuſe but burne, and burne alwaies, we ſay, that it is fire: ſo Chriſt, doing diuine workes, and the ſame with his Father, and that hee cannot but doe them, and doth them after the ſame manner that his Father doth, hee muſt needs be God. Some Hereticke haue obiected againſt this place, that Chriſt doth theſe things by imitation; and this they ſay is, meant by [ſeeing and ſhewing.]
                     
                        Anſwer. It is falſe, becauſe he doth theſe things by the ſame authority and power, that the Father, hauing life and power in himſelfe, as verſ. 26. and becauſe he doth them after the ſame manner that the Father doth.
                     As touching the Phraſes of ſeeing on the Sonnes part, and ſhewing on the Fathers part: theſe are ſpoken, Firſt, in regard of our conceit. Secondly, to ſhew the diſtinction betweene the Perſons; the Father being the Fountaine of the deity, ſheweth; and the Sonne, the ſecond perſon, is ſayd to ſee.
                     3. This may be interpreted of the humane Nature of Chriſt.
                     
                        Vſe. 1. Seeing Chriſt proues his equality with the Father, in regard of the effects common to both, we muſt learne to account of all things done and ſpoken by Chriſt, as done and ſpoken by God the Father; and ſo to giue credence, reuerence, and obedience accordingly to the ſame.
                     2. As to account of the doing of Chriſt, as done by God,

ſo likewiſe when we behold the workes of God the Father; as the frame of the World, and the things therein and doe conſider in them the glory and Maieſty of God; to conſider alſo in, and by them, the glory and excellent Maieſty of Chriſt: and in this we goe beyond the Iewes, Turks and Heathen, who in the creatures cā behold the Maieſty, of God the Father only.
                     3. In the workes of redemption, which ſet forth the loue, mercy, and goodnes of Chriſt towards vs to obſerue the loue and mercy of God.
                     4. That what Chriſt doth by Neceſſity, though not of compulſion, but of nature and eſſence, we ſhuld endeuor to do, ſtriuing 
                           •
                        o do 
                           •
                        he will of God, and to doe nothing but what we haue a warrant for out of the reuealed wil of God. So like wiſe to be like to him in all things, viz. in kindnes, in goodnes, in honeſſe, and ſuch like vertues, which are layd downe in the Word, as a rule for vs to walke by, and wherein he hath ſet himſelfe forth as a patterne for vs to follow. For a ground of this, note that prayer of Chriſt, Ioh. 17.21. we are all one] not in eſſence, but miſtically hauing the ſame Spirit. Wherefore wee ſhould labour as truly to initate God as Chriſt though not as equally. And as Chriſt did his eſſentiall vnion by effects equall with thoſe of his Father, ſo wee to ſhew our ſpirituall vnion by like effects.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſe 20.
                           For the Father loueth the Sonne and ſheweth him all things that himſelfe doth,—
                        
                     
                     IN theſe words are layd downe the Cauſes of the former effects; they are twofold. Firſt, Partly the Loue of the Father Secondly, Partly that the Father doth communicate all things to the Sonne.
                     
                        The Father loueth the Sonne.] This is here expreſſed by a kind of propriety, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , he loueth him alone, none like him, him in, and for himſelfe, vid. Col. 1.13. Epheſ. 1.6. Matth. 3.17. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , a word that ſignifieth one, that onely, and wholly beloued.
                     
                        Reaſon of this is not grace and fauour, but Nature, becauſe Chriſt is his Sonne: as earthly men doe loue their children, becauſe they come from themſelues, and are of their ſubſtance. vid. Pro. 8.30. Heb. 1.2. Now according to the greatneſſe of the perſons louing and loued, ſo is the loue, viz. euery way infinite, the like whereof is not in the World to be found. So that Chriſt is hee in whom is the beginning of Gods loue, and on whom it doth reſt, and from whom it is conueyed to all other. This, firſt, doth greatly amplifie the loue of God, that hee would giue the Sonne of his loue to vs: and of Chriſt, that being his Fathers delight, hee would come from his boſome for our ſakes. How great a loue were it for a King to giue his onely ſonne for a poore Captiue. This thing was ſo highly accepted of God in Abraham, that hee did not ſpare his onely ſonne, that it was an occaſion why God did ſweare ſo to bleſſe his poſterity: Gen. 22.16, 17.
                     2. This is a maine ground to ſtrengthen our faith, in the interceſſion of Chriſt, to come vnto the Throne of Grace with confidence and boldneſſe. For is Chriſt the Sonne of Gods loue? and will he then deny vs any thing that we ſhall aske in his Name? And for this cauſe wee ought to hold vs cloſe to Chriſt, and to ſticke wholly to him.
                     Further, this loue muſt be conſidered not onely as a thing proper to Chriſt, but alſo as an euidence of Gods loue vnto vs, that we may gather from hence, that we are loued. For Chriſt hauing vnited vs vnto himſelfe, wee may be aſſured, that God who ſo greatly loueth the Head, will alſo loue the Members: Ioh. 17.23. And this is meant, Matth. 3.17. God is well pleaſed in Chriſt, not onely with him, but with whomſoeuer he beholds in him; as Epheſ. 1.6. ſo that none are loued but in Chriſt, and all in Chriſt are loued.
                     So much for this firſt Cauſe, ſimply conſidered in himſelfe: Now we come to conſider it in the reference thereof, viz. as it is to ſhew the ground of that power, authoritie, dignitie, excellency, and equality which Chriſt hath with his Father. Whence we learne, that Chriſt did not vſurpe theſe things, bu
                           •
                         God did freely and willingly beſtow th
                           •
                        m on him.
                     
                        
                        Vſe. 1. Further to ſtrengthen ou
                           •
                         confidence in him, to repoſe our ſelues vpon his redemption, mediation, &amp;c. Secondly, it ſerues for the terror of thoſe, that oppoſe themſelues againſt this dignitie and equality of Chriſt: for they prouoke God, and are fighters againſt him, who hath in loue communicated theſe things to Chriſt. Thus did the Iewes, becauſe they would haue none to be equall to God, oppoſe againſt the authoritie of Chriſt: and this likewiſe is ſpoken to aggranate their malice.
                     The ſecond Cauſe whereby it comes to paſſe, that Chriſt doth the ſame workes with his Father, is, becauſe the Father ſheweth him all things. Which is not to bee taken for a bare relation, or an inſtruction; or that the Father doth them only in the preſence of the Sonne, as one man may doe a thing in preſence of another; or that he ſets them before him, as in a Mappe or Table: but for a communication that the Sonne doth participate of the Wiſedome, Power, and whatſoeuer elſe the Father hath, together with his Eſſence. Secondly, that the Father doth ſo ſet forth himſelfe in his Sonne, that he may be ſeene in him▪ and who ſo knoweth the Sonne, may know the Father, as Ioh. 14.9. And this is a further argument to proue the equality, becauſe God cōmunicates all things to him.
                     
                        Vſe. 1. It ſhewes vnto vs, how the vnſearchable myſteries, and depth of Gods wiſedome come to our knowledge, and to be reuealed vnto vs. God hath communicated them to Chriſt, and Chriſt hath declared them to vs. See Reuel. 5.5. &amp;c. And this ſhewes a reaſon of that phraſe, that Chriſt is called the Word, becauſe he hath vttered the will of his Father, and hath declared the ſecret Councels of God, Therefore are wee to heare him, Matth. 17.5. as the old World was to hearken vnto him, ſpeaking by his Prophets, and the Iewes to himſelfe when hee was on earth, and the Church afterward when hee ſpake by his Apoſtles; ſo are wee now to hearken to him ſpeaking in his Miniſters, who declare to vs the will of God. So much for theſe cauſes conſidered ſeuerally in themſelues.
                     Now conſider them ioyntly, as, the loue of the Father is made the ground of communicating all things to the Sonne. Whence obſerue, that
                     
                        1. All that Chriſt hath from his Father, it come from loue, then how much more doth all that which is in vs come of loue.
                     2. According to the loue that the Father did beare vnto the Sonne, accordingly did he beſtow the Spirit: Ioh. 3.34. alſo dignitie and honour vpon him.
                     
                        Vſe. So likewiſe learne we by Grace to iudge of Gods loue towards vs, if we find that we are regenerated and ſanctified, to be perſwaded of Gods loue. And further, by the meaſure of grace, to hope for the meaſure of glory: for the more grace wee haue, the more God loues vs; the greater is his loue, the greater will be our glory.
                     3. It is a fruit and token of loue, to enuie no skill, knowledge, dignity, honour, &amp;c. but to be ready to communicate all things. So ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples; You are my friends, I haue ſhewed you all things. And herein eſpecially is that ſaying true, Among friends all things are common. And this may bee a triall for Parents if they loue their children, for Schoolemaſters if they loue their ſcholers, and for all friends if they loue one another.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 20.
                           —and he will ſhew him greater workes then theſe, that yee may maruell.
                        
                     
                     NOw we come to conſider the particular euidences of this equalitie: but before we come to ſpeake of them, wee muſt conſider the tranſition from the former generall points vnto thoſe that follow, here laid downe by Chriſt in theſe words. Which is done, firſt, to preuent a ſecret obiection which the Iewes might make: For it is ſo, that what the Father doth, thou doeſt; and what thou doeſt, the Father doth; can the Father then doe no more, then that which thou haſt done, 
                           
                              •
                           iz. to cure the ſicke, giue ſight to the blinde? &amp;c. Chriſt anſwereth; God can doe more: theſe are but ſmall euidences of his almighty power, but hee will manifeſt vnto his Sonne greater workes, whereby it ſhall be declared, that hee is the Sonne of

God. Secondly, to ſtirre vp attention, becauſe the things which Chriſt had yet done, were lightly eſteemed, and oppoſed againſt, now therefore God would ſhew ſuch great workes, that their hearts ſhould be amazed and aſtoniſhed at.
                     In this tranſition are two points; firſt, the extent of Chriſts power [greater workes.] Secondly, the euent of it, [they ſhould maruell.]
                     For the former, it hath reference to the miracles which Chriſt had before time done. Whence the Doctrine is, that Chriſts miracles which hee did, were but euidences of a farre greater, and more almighty power; as his miracles of healing the ſicke, of power to cure our ſinnes, of reſtoring ſight to the blinde, of power to illighten our minds, of caſting out of diuels, of his power of ſubduing the Diuell, and deliuering vs from his bondage, and the like. And this vſe ought we to make in reading the miracles of Chriſt.
                     2. Yee ſhould maruell. Yee, mine enemies.
                     
                        Doct. Such is the euidence of Chriſts power, that it maketh all aſtoniſhed: as we may reade at the working of moſt of his miracles, and at his reſurrection, how greatly the Iewes were aſtoniſhed. And at the day of Iudgement, all ſuch as haue oppoſed againſt him, ſhall tremble and quake. Now this aſtoniſhment at the power of Chriſt is, that wherein we muſt reſt, it being an argument rather of Chriſts power, then of our faith in him. But we muſt conſider the end of this power, for which it was giuen him, viz. that hee hath it for our good, that hee might ſaue vs; and then his power will be a ground of our faith, to make vs to ſhroud our ſelues vnder him.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſe 21.
                           For as the Father rayſeth vp the dead, and quickeneth them: euen ſo the Sonne quickeneth whom he will.
                        
                     
                     THe Particular euidences for the proofe of the equality betweene Chriſt and God the Father, are,

                           1. The Power of quickening in this verſe.
                           2. The Right and Authority of Iudging: verſ. 22.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        Rayſeth and quickeneth.] To phraſes, implying one thing, as appeares in the other cauſe, where but one is expreſſed, yet not in vaine is that of quickening added. For firſt, it ſhewes, that they were dead, and ſo vnable to helpe themſelues. Secondly, that he rayſeth them not as ſtocks and ſtones, but with the raiſing puts life into them; which amplifies the benefits. Some take this raiſing of the dead to bee meant of Chriſts miracles, in raiſing of the dead, but that is to much to reſtraine it only to that: wherefore hereby is implied, firſt, a Spirituall quickening from the death of Sinne, at our conuerſion. Secondly, a corporall quickening, the raiſing of our bodies out of the graues at the laſt Day; now if we will referre the miracles of Chriſt vnto this, as euidences and proofes of what he was able to doe at the laſt Day.
                     
                        Euen ſo, &amp;c.] Herein is the equality: as the Father doth raiſe vp the dead ſo doth the Sonne.
                     
                        Whom he will.] This is not ſpoken to put a difference, that the Father doth quicken ſome whom he will, and the Sonne others whom he will; but is added as a ioynt worke to both; not reſtrayned to the Son, but only applied to him; and this, Firſt, becauſe the Iewes doubted not concerning the Father, but confeſſed that he was able to raiſe vp whom he would.
                     Wherfore this ſhews, firſt, that there was no compulſiue neceſſity in Chriſt to do, as the Father doth, but a meere freewill. Secondly, as there is a vnity in Nature betweene them; ſo is there likewiſe in Will. Thirdly, that the Sonne hath a power to quicken whom he will, and whom he lets he dead in ſinne. Fourthly, that this quickening is of Grace.
                     5. That this is a happy quickening here meant, belonging to thoſe that he will ſhew grace vnto. So it is not ſimply to be taken for the raiſing from the graue, but for a rayſing to life euerlaſting. Such a raiſing as we beleeue in the Creed.
                     The point then is, that the Work of the Father and the Son in quickening, is one and the ſame: 1. Ioh. 5.11.
                     Whence are two euidences to proue the equality: Firſt, He that quickeneth the dead, is equall to God the Father in power. But Chriſt quickeneth the dead; Therefore, &amp;c. Secondly,

The Sonne doth this of his freewill; ſo alſo is he equall to the Father.
                     Conſider in the words two points; firſt, the effect: Secondly, the ground of the Effect.
                     The effect is quickening of the dead, which is here brought in, 
                           •
                        s one of thoſe greater workes which the Father will ſhew vnto the Sonne, hence note, the
                     
                        Doct. Quickening of the dead is one of the greateſt euidences of diuine power: greater then that of Creation. Thus the Apoſtle when he would ſet forth the great power of God, he alleadgeth this: Rom. 4.17. Eph. 1.19.20. Rom. 1.4. a worke ſo great, that of naturall men it cannot be conceiued and beleeued: Act 17.18. yea it was hard for the Diſciples to beleeue it: as Thomas. Io. 20 25.
                     And as this Reſurrection from the graue, ſo is our Quickening from ſinne, an euidence of the power of God. And for this cauſe, the meanes of quickning is called, The power of God: Rom. 1.16. 1. Cor. 2.5. For we are dead in ſinnes.
                     
                        Vſe. 1. We ſee how needfull it is to meditate on the power of Chriſt, to ſtrengthen our Faith, in regard of the Reſurrection.
                     2. That ſeeing our raiſing from ſinne, is one of the great euidences of Gods almighty power, it confutes the Pelagians, that ſay, a man may raiſe himſelfe: and Semipelagians that ſay, a man is but ſicke, and being helped by a little grace, hee workes out his ſaluation himſelfe. And laſtly, all carnall Goſpellers, that thinke they can turne from their ſinnes when they will, and leade a ſpirituall life.
                     2. The ground of this effect, is the will of God. Hence we learne, that
                     
                        Doct. Chriſt as Mediatour hath an abſolute power of life and death, to pull whom hee will out of this iawes of death, and to ſuffer whom he will to periſh: Ioh. 10.18. Reuel. 1.18.
                     
                        Vſe. For conſolation of thoſe that belieue in Chriſt, that if here we haue euidence of grace, we may be aſſured to bee raiſed vp againe to life. For if the Spirit of Chriſt be in vs, it will raiſe vs vp a
                           •
                         the laſt day, as the Apoſtle 
                           ••
                        ith. For regeneration

is but the firſt fruits of eternall life. See Epheſ. 2.4, 5, 6.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 22.
                           For the Father iudgeth no man, but hath committed all iudgement to the Sonne.
                        
                     
                     IN this Verſe is laid downe a ſecond particular euidence, and proofe of the equalitie of Chriſt with God the Fathe
                           •
                        : the Argument is this: Hee that hath all power, all gouernment, and all iudgement committed vnto him, is equall to the Father. But Chriſt hath all theſe, &amp;c. Therefore he is equall to his Father.
                     Alſo this is ſet downe as a reaſon of the former argument, Verſ. 21. For Chriſt may quicken whom he will, becauſe (as it is in this Verſe) he is the ſupreame Lord that guides and gouernes all things.
                     For the meaning of the words, note the phraſes of [Iudgeth, Iudgement:] iudgings and iudgement are not to be taken (only) concerning the laſt Iudgement, but concerning the ſupreme diſpoſition and gouernment of all things in the world: as appeares by the word [all iudgement.]
                     
                        Iudgeth no man] That is, by himſelfe alone, but in, and by the Sonne.
                     
                        Hath committed] That is, the Father doth communicate to the Sonne this Office, and hath taken him into his fellowſhip in the gouernment of the World: not that the Father doth ſit idly in Heauen, but that in, and by his Son, he doth gouerne all things.
                     The Doctrine that hence naturally ariſeth, is, that Chriſt is the ſupreame Lord and Gouernour of all, Matth. 28.18. Mat. 11.27. Heb. 1.2. Which is to be vnderſtood of Chriſt as he is Mediatour, as we ſhall ſee, Verſ. 27.
                     Obiections againſt this, are, firſt, that vſually iudgement is attributed to God.
                     
                        Anſw. Chriſt here is not excluded, but it is to bee taken of the whole Trinity.
                     
                        Obiect. 2. out of Ioh, 8.15,
                     
                        
                        Anſw. Chriſt here is not excluded, but it is to bee taken of the whole Trinity.
                     2. Obiect. out of Ioh 8.15.
                     
                        Anſw. That is not to be excluſiuely, but that there is one that doth iudge, namely, the Father, yet he doth it in and by his Sonne. It is there ſpoken of the Father for the greater terrour of the Iewes.
                     3. Obiect. out of Ioh. 8.15. where it ſeemes that there is a plaine contradiction.
                     
                        Anſ. That is ſpoken of Chriſt his preſent action and carriage not of his power and right of iudging, as appeares by verſ. 16. [for himſelfe did teach and inſtruct them.]
                     2. It is ſpoken in oppoſition to the Phariſes that were raſh in cenſuring others.
                     
                        Vſe, 1. It teacheth vs how to account of Chriſt not only as of a Sauiour from whom we looke for good, but alſo as a ſupreame Lord, and ſo to feare and reuerence and to bee afraid to diſpleaſe him as Pſ. 2. and not to make him a packhorſe for our ſinnes, becauſe he is a Sauiour.
                     2. It is for our conſolation, that this our Sauiour is Iudge. Who then ſhall lay any thing to our charge?
                     3. It is for terrour of thoſe that oppoſe themſelues againſt Chriſt. As Iewes, and Turks, and ſuch as perſecute his members: for they perſecute him that is their Iudge.
                     4. That all men ſhould honour the Sonne, as in the verſe following.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſe 23.
                           That all men ſhould honour the Sonne euen as they honour the Father; he that honoreth not the Sonne honoreth not the Father which hath ſent him.
                        
                     
                     THis verſe containes an Amplification of the former Effects by the end of them, wherein conſider.
                     1. The end it ſelfe, which is a duty of Honour to be performed.
                     2. The manner of performing it.
                     
                        3. The motiues to vrge and preſſeit.
                     In the duty conſider, 1. the thing it ſ
                           •
                        lfe, 2. the extent. The thing it ſelfe is honour: which is a generall word compriſing vnder it all thoſe duties, which we owe to Chriſt, as it is vſuall to comprehend the duties of inferiours to ſuperiour in this word Honour, as the fift Commandement.
                     
                        Doct. Honour is due to our Lord Chriſt Ieſus: Pſal. 2. laſt. For kiſſing was a token of ſubiection. Heb. 1.6. ſo we read that Chriſt was often worſhipped, as by the wiſe men, Mat. 2. by the leper Mat. 8. and by his diſciples.
                     Reaſon, becauſe Chriſt though he did abaſe himſelfe, yet he ſtill remained God and loſt none of 
                           •
                        is exc
                           •
                        llency therefore we are ſtill to honour him.
                     
                        Vſe, That it is not ſufficient to abſtaine from rebellion, and from diſhonouring and deſpiting of Chriſt but we muſt reuerence and honor him, for the omitting of a holy duty makes vs liable to the iudgement of God, as appeares in the laſt ſentence of Chriſt. Wherfore it is not ſufficient to ſay we are no Arrians, nor Iews to denie Chriſt, nor Papiſts to confound his offices? but where is the faith in him? how doſt thou reuerence and feare him? &amp;c.
                     2. Point, is the Extent, in this word (all)
                     
                        Doct. All of what ſtate and condition ſoeuer are bound to this dutie of honouring Chriſt: the Angels, Pſalm. and Heb. 1.6.
                     Reaſon is Phil. 2.9. he hath a name aboue euery name, and ſo euery knee muſt bow to him.
                     The manner of performing this duty is in theſe words (as they honor the Father) which ſhewes the meaſure of that honour which we muſt doe vnto the Sonne, for the 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         implies not only a ſimilitude and likenes, as ſome Heretikes would put it off, but alſo an equality implying ſuch an honour as is due to no creature but only to God.
                     
                        Doct. So high and great honour as is due to the father, in that meaſure is it due to the Sonne as appeares by many places Iude verſe 25. in the ſalutation of Paul in his Epiſtles where he is ioyned with the Father, and hath the Church done in giuing

glory to the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. ioyning all together.
                     Reaſon of this is the equality between them, and this is alſo another argument (the ſixt) to proue that ſame equality, becauſe the ſame honour is giuen to Chriſt, that is giuen to God the Father; Eſay. 42.8.
                     Note this againſt Turkes, that account Chriſt to bee a great Prophet, and Arrians that count him to be a God, but an inferiour, and created God.
                     The Motiues to vrge this dutie are in theſe words [He that honoureth not, &amp;c.] Where conſider, firſt, the Reaſon; ſecondly, the Amplification.
                     The Reaſon is [He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father] which is layd downe, Firſt, as a ſtrong reaſon, becauſe this honour is not only, in regard of a high account that he hath of his Sonne, as a King counts himſelfe honoured, when his ſonne is honoured, or in regard of a deare affection that he beares to him, or in regard of place and repreſentation of the perſon of the Father, the King is honored when his Ambaſſadour is honoured, but alſo in regard of an identity and ſameneſſe, that the Father cannot bee honoured but by the Sonne.
                     2. It is ſet downe to preuent an obiection that might bee made, that this honour was derogatory to the Father. Chriſts anſweres, Th
                           •
                        re is no ſuch conſequence, but that the Father is honoured in this, and not diſhonoured.
                     
                        Doct. The Father is honoured in, and by the Sonne. Phil. 2.11 Thus God is to be praiſed by Chriſt; Heb. 13.15. Eph. 5.20. ſo are the Prayers of the Church concluded all in the name of Chriſt.
                     
                        Vſe. 1. it ſhewes, that many deceiue themſelues in the worſhipping of God: for th
                           •
                        ugh all thi
                           •
                        ke that God is to be honou
                           •
                        ed, yet not knowing Chriſt, they worſhip not him, but their owne conceits.
                     2. It teacheth vs, to behold all the attributes of God in Chriſt.
                     The Amplification is in theſe words [Who hath ſent him.]

This may ſeeme to croſſe all that hath beene formerly ſaid. For an Embaſſadour is inferiour in honour to a King that ſent him.
                     
                        Anſw. The Phraſe of ſending doth not alwaies implie an infe
                           •
                        iority.
                     It is here vſed in a threefold reſpect; firſt of diſtinction of the Perſons in the Trinity: So the ſecond may bee ſayd to bee ſent of the firſt: and ſo the Holy Ghoſt, though he neuer abaſed himſelfe, nor were incarnate, is yet ſayd to bee ſent by the Father and the Sonne: Ioh. 14.26. et 15.26.
                     2. Of Chriſts incarnation, that though he became man, yet was he Lord of Heauen and Earth, and ſent from God. So it implies an honour and dignity.
                     3. Of the Offices of Chriſt, as he is Mediatour in a twofold reſpect; firſt, that no Office that Chriſt had, but it was appointed and ordeined of God: Luk. 1.69. God is ſayd to rayſe vp a ſaluation. Secondly, as theſe Offices were appointed to Chriſt; ſo was he deputed to them: Heb. 5.4, 5.
                     This Phraſe then amplifies the reaſon, and ſhewes, that this equall right of honor to him, as to the Father, is no vſurpation, but a naturall communication, and voluntary diſpenſation.
                     
                        Doct. Chriſt vſurped not that honour, to be equall in dignity to his Father: Pſal. 110. 1. Act. 2.36.
                     
                        Vſe. 1. Of comfort, that the things that Chriſt did, are acceptable to the Father for vs.
                     2. It ſhewes the ſinne to be the greater, in diſhonouring the Sonne.
                     3. Here we haue a good ground why we performe diuine worſhip to Chriſt. Why doe not the Papiſts bring the like for worſhipping of Saints.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 24.
                           Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, he that heareth my Word, and beleeueth in him that ſent me, hath euerlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but hath paſſed from death to life.
                        
                     
                     CHriſt hauing in the former verſe laid down the ends of the particular euidences of his Deity, proceedes againe in this verſe and followeth to a further amplification of them: more powerfully, plainely, and diſtinctly; to vrge and preſſe them. The former, as we haue heard, was the Power of quickening. In the amplification whereof there are three parts.
                     1. Who are quickned in this verſe 24.
                     2. By what Meanes they come to be quickened, 12.
                     The voice of Chriſt, verſe 25.
                     3. The Ground of this quickening power that is in Chriſt; verſe 26.
                     The ſecond effect was the Power of Iudging: whereof wee ſhall ſpeake, verſe 27. and followeth.
                     Verſe 24· Touching the occaſion of theſe words, and dependance of them on the former, it may bee conſidered in two reſpects:
                     1. Wee heard, verſ. 22. that the Sonne quickeneth whom hee will: hereby implying, that euery Son of Adam is not quickened, but thoſe only to whom he ſheweth fauour. Now who they be, is here expreſſed in this verſe, viz. ſuch as heare his Word, and beleeue in God.
                     2. Verſe 23. was ſhewed that there is an honour due to Chriſt; now he ſheweth what it is, viz. to belieue in him, &amp;c.
                     Hence we learne.
                     
                        Doct. 1. That they only, which doe heare the Word of Chriſt, and doe beleeue in God the Father, doe partake of the the quickening power of Chriſt. For this hearing and beleeuing, is a beginning of our quickening, and raiſing from death: ſo that from hence wee may gather an euidence, and aſſurance, whether this quickening power of Chriſt doe belong to

vs, and whether we be of the number whom Chriſt will ray
                           •
                        e vp vnto life eternall, yea or no.
                     
                        Doct. 2. That the honour, which is due vnto Chriſt, is to hearken to him in his Word, and to beleeue in him.
                     This is all that is required of vs: Deut. 18.15. Mat. 17.5. Ioh. 3.16. viz. to beleeue.
                     
                        Vſe is, firſt, to ſtirre vs vp to honour Chriſt by this meanes: euen as ſubiects, if they ſee their King to count himſelfe honoured by ſuch and ſuch things, they will endeauour to doe them.
                     2. To reproue them that will honour God after their owne conceits, as Saul, 1. Sa, 15.22. or after the traditions of men as Mat. 15.9. or by outward pomps and ſolemnities as the Papiſts, which are but toyes to the excellent maieſty of Chriſt. So much for the dependance.
                     The words themſelues containe in generall a deſcription of ſuch as are raiſed vp by Chriſt. The parts are,
                     1. A Preface, Verily, &amp;c.] of which hath been ſpoken before, only here it is added to moue vs to attend vnto the matter deliuered as a point to bee much regarded and obſerued.
                     2. A promiſe wherein obſerue firſt, the Parties to whom it is made. Secondly, the promiſe it ſelfe [hath euerlaſting life, &amp;c.
                     The Parties are deſcribed by their actions: firſt, [he that heareth] Secondly [and beleeneth] theſe actions are both of them amplified by their obiects firſt [my word] ſecondly [him that ſent me.
                     
                     The firſt action, [he that heareth] which is layd downe both as a cauſe of the latter viz. of beleeuing, and as a meanes to attaine to life euerlaſting. Whence we learne.
                     
                        Doct. That the meanes to attaine to true faith and to eternal life, is the hearing of the Word. Rom. 10.14, 15, 17. Epheſ. 1.13. Act. 15.7. that faith followes hearing the Word. Now eternall life is a conſequent of faith as Eſa. 55.3. 1. Ti. 4.16. hence the word is called the word of ſaluation. Act. 13.26. Eph. 1.13. Rom. 1.16. yea ſaluation it ſelfe Heb· 2.3.
                     Reaſon. Firſt hearing is a cauſe of knowledge, now knowledge

and illumination are a ground of Faith. Secondly, by hearing, is the Spirit conuayed vnto vs; by which Spirit, Faith is wrought in vs: by faith we are vnited to Chriſt; and being vnited to him, we haue a right and title to heauen. So the Word is called the miniſtery of the Spirit. 2. Cor. 3.6. Gal. 3.2.
                     
                        Vſe. 1, For Miniſters that they be faithfull, diligent, and conſcionable in preaching of the Word: for it there bee no preaching, there can be no hearing: Rom. 10.14. a point of exceeding great moment becauſe idle and idoll paſtors doe ſhut vp the kingdome of heauen againſt the people, and cauſe them to lie in ſinne and incredulity, ſo becomming guilty of their blood: 1. Cor 9.16.
                     2. For the people to ſtirre them vp to diligence to hearken and attend vnto this Word when it is preached, &amp;c.
                     The obiect of hearing is here ſayd, to be the Word of Chriſt. Whence we learne;
                     
                        Doct. That it is not euery word which is able to worke faith in vs, but only the Word of the Sonne of God. The Goſpell my Word] as oppoſed to the words of men, and their traditions. Ioh. 6.63. Rom. 1, 9. Ioh. 1.18, and 14.6.
                     The law cannot doe this; for that is the letter that killeth, and it is the miniſtery of death: 2. Cor. 3.6.7. and much leſſe then the words of men, and their traditions.
                     Vſe is to teach vs, that as we be diligent to heare, ſo we bee carefull to know what we heare.
                     The ſecond Action, is to belieue. Though hearing be a thing neceſſary, and a good ground-work and beginning, yet it is not ſufficient, but we muſt further beleeue in the truth, declared by the Goſpell.
                     
                        Doct. It is not ſufficient to heare the Word onely, but Faith muſt be added to our hearing: Hebr. 3.2. Epheſ. 1.13. Rom. 1.16.
                     For the Word doth but onely offer grace. Now what good is it to haue a Benefice offered onely, if it be not receiued: but this is done by Faith: Act. 13.48.
                     
                        Vſe. As before we were exhorted to heare, ſo here wee are directed how to heare, viz. not to content our ſelues with a

bare and naked hearing, or that we doe vnderſtand the Preacher, and know the myſteries of the Scripture, but to apply the Word and Promiſes to our ſelues.
                     The Obiect of this action is deſcribed in theſe words [him that ſent me] which is a deſcription of God the Father, and implies a relation betweene the Father and the Sonne: as if he had ſaid, In him of whom I am, who hath giuen me vnto the World, &amp;c.
                     
                        Doct. God as he is the Father of Chriſt Ieſus, is the onely obiect of our Faith; and therefore he ſaith not [and beleeueth in God] ſimply, but in him that ſent me. And therefore wee muſt come vnto God in Chriſt, and doe whatſoeuer we doe in, and through him: Heb. 13.15.
                     No creature can bee the obiect of our Faith, on which wee may reſt, becauſe it is not able to protect vs from Gods wrath. Neither is God himſelfe, as he hath immediately to doe with vs, for ſo he is moſt ſtrict in iuſtice, and as a conſuming fire, before which we are but ſtubble. Onely as he is well pleaſed in Chriſt, and in him manifeſteth his grace and fauour, may approach vnto him with confidence.
                     
                        
                           Ʋſe. It ſhewes the vanitie of the moſt part of the World, that either know not Chriſt, or deny him, as the Iewes; and ſo dare to come vnto him in great iuſtice. So much of the Parties.
                     The Promiſe is declared, firſt, affirmatiuely [hath euerlaſting life.] Secondly, negatiuely, and ſhall not, &amp;c.
                     
                        Doct. The fruite of that honour which we performe to Chriſt Ieſus, is eternall life: Ioh. 10.27, 28. 1. Pet. 1.3, 4. which is not in regard of any deſert of the workes, but of Gods free grace, who ſets downe this reward to encourage vs, and to magnifie his owne mercy.
                     Which ſhewes his fatherly tenderneſſe towards vs, that whereas we are bound to doe no leſſe, and he might abſolutely command vs; yet hee rather chuſeth to draw vs on by the hope of reward.
                     
                        Vſe. To bee ſtirred vp to the performance of theſe duties, both in regard of thankefulneſſe to God, and in reſpect

of our owne good.
                     This is now further amplified by the contrary, [and ſhall not come into condemnation, &amp;c.] Which imply in effect the ſame things that the former; yet they are added not in vaine, but for the further confirmation and ſtrengthening of our Faith in a matter of ſuch weight, and for the answering of all obiections that might be brought.
                     Wherefore this ſhewes a double benefit: Firſt, we ſhall haue life. Secondly, we ſhall be deliuered from death. And further it notes a difference betweene that happineſſe wherein man was firſt made, and that whereunto we are brought by Chriſt. Adam was created happy and immortall: but withall there was a poſſibility to fall. But we not onely haue immortalitie and life, but alſo ſuch a firmeneſſe and ſtability, as we ſhall not come into death.
                     [Hath paſſed from death to life.] Some take the meaning to be thus, that the beleeuer when he dies goeth vnto Heauen; which is a good ſenſe, and comfortable: but rather we are to vnderſtand it thus, viz. that by death is meant, the ſubiection of vs all to eternall condemnation. But now ſo ſoone as wee beleeue the Obligation and Band is cancelled, and wee hauing Faith, haue our acquittance, and are ſet free.
                     
                        Doct· Faith brings with it a diſcharge from condemnation, Rom. 8.1.
                     Which is to be noted as a ſpeciall comfort of our conſciences againſt the terrour of ſinne, and horrour of condemnation.
                     
                        Doct. 2. No middle betweene damnation and ſaluation: he that is freed from the one, is ſure of the other. [Hath paſſed from death to life.] This appeares in the Parable of Lazarus and the rich Man: and in the ſentence of the laſt Iudgement: as is plaine by reaſon, becauſe there are but two ſorts of people, the one in Chriſt, the other out of Chriſt, &amp;c. Which muſt note againſt the Papiſts conceits of Limbus Patrū, Limbus Infantum, and Purgatory: which as it is derogatory to the blood of Chriſt, 1. Ioh. 1.7. ſo is it a doctrine very vncomfortable, and that which doth adde a ſting vnto death: alſo it is a cauſe of much vniuſtice, when Parents will giue away their lands from

their children to Monkes, &amp;c. to ſing for their ſoules.
                     Now concerning the phraſe, hath eternall life, and hath paſſed, &amp;c. it implies the certaintie of theſe promiſes. Yet a queſtion will be made, in what reſpect we may be ſaid ſo ſoone as we beleeue to haue eternall life?
                     
                        Anſw. It is, firſt in regard of hope.
                     2. Becauſe we haue the beginnings, and firſt fruits of it, viz. we are taken into the Kingdome of grace, which is the beginning of the Kingdome of glory.
                     3. In regard of our vnion with Chriſt our Head, and now glorified. Now wee being members of that body, whereof the head and principall part is raiſed vp, and in poſſeſſion of eternall life, we may be ſaid alſo, as Epheſ. 2.6.
                     
                        Doct. The true beleeuer is, and may be ſure of his eternall ſaluation. Which is to bee noted againſt our aduerſaries the Papiſts. Secondly, as a comfort to vphold vs in time of trouble.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 25.
                           Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, the houre is comming, and now is, when the dead ſhall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that heare ſhall liue.
                        
                     
                     IN theſe words is laid downe the ſecond generall point, viz. the meanes whereby they are quickned. The parts are two.
                     1. A Preface, [Verily, &amp;c.] which words are here the third time laid downe. Now we may not thinke, that Chriſt vſed in vaine theſe ſtrong aſſeuerations, but that hee doth this to ſtrengthen our Faith, to rouze vp our dulneſſe, and to aggrauate the incredulity of thoſe, that yet notwithſtanding all this will not beleeue.
                     2. A Promiſe: wherein conſider,
                     1. The time of accompliſhing of it, [the houre commeth] viz. of Chriſts death, reſurrection, and glorification; for then he drew all men vnto him, and then was the Goſpell publiſhed abroad. Yet this houre was now begun, becauſe that Chriſt

was now exhibited. Now this time is called an houre, becauſe it is a ſet and certaine period which God hath appointed, and in which theſe things ſhould be fulfilled.
                     
                        Doct. The time of the Goſpell is the time of ſaluation: for Chriſt here ſpeaketh of the time of the Goſpell: 2. Cor. 6.2.
                     2. The parties on whom this worke is to be wrought, viz. the Dead, that is, all naturall men; eſpecially meant of the Gentiles, who before this time were Alians from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, &amp;c.
                     
                        Doct. The ſtate of naturall men, is the ſtate of dead men: Epheſ. 2. there is in them by nature no iot, or dramme of ſpirituall life. Which note,
                     1. Againſt heretikes that haue ſo much magnified Nature, as the Pelagians.
                     2. That we may take notice of the wretchedneſſe, and vileneſſe of our nature wherein we are borne.
                     3. To ſhew, that the worke of our conuerſation is a powerfull worke and diuine. And for this cauſe we are not to maruell, that the ſhrill ſound of the voyce of the Goſpell doe not pierce vnto the heart of many men; for why? they are dead,
                     3. The meanes whereby it is wrought, viz. the voice of Chriſt, not onely of himſelfe whileſt hee was here liuing vpon the earth, but eſpecially is it to be taken for that power, which by his Spirit he giues vnto the Word preached. And therfore though Miniſters doe preach, and may be ſaid to conuert; yet properly it is the powerfull voyce of Chriſt ſpeaking in them, that worketh vpon the heart.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 28.
                           Maruell not at this: for the houre is comming, in which all that are in the graues ſhall heare his voyce.
                        
                     
                     IN this Verſe is contained, firſt, a Reproofe of the incredulity of the Iewes, [Maruell not]: for they tooke Chriſt for no other then an ordinary man, and therefore did not beleeue that which he had ſpoken, Verſ. 26, 27. of his power and authoritie; but wondred much that he ſhould ſay ſuch things of himſelfe.

There is an holy admiration without doubting, as when we admire the great workes of God, whereof yet we make no doubt: but ſo to wonder, as to call in queſtion any truth of God, to thinke it impoſſible, becauſe wee apprehend not the reaſon of it; this is a fault, and here reprooued. For hereby we doe impeach the power of God, and bring it to our owne reaſon.
                     2. A further proofe and confirmation of the point in queſtion, viz. the power and authority of Chriſt. The proofe is drawne from the effect, namely, the raiſing vp of the Dead. So that in briefe, it containeth a deſcription of the Reſurrection: wherein obſerue.
                     
                        1. The Time.
                        
                        2. The Parties.
                        
                        3. The Cauſe.
                        
                     
                     1. In the Time note, firſt, that it is a ſet time and period appointed by God [the houre], which time we are with patience to waite for. Secondly, it commeth; it ſhall not bee preuented, not ouerpaſſed, but ſhall certainely come. Which, firſt, is againſt all deniers of the Reſurrection. Secondly, it is for our comfort at the time of death, as alſo in regard of our friends departed. And laſtly, it ſerues to encourage vs to goe on in our Chriſtian courſe: 1. Cor. 15. laſt verſe.
                     2. The Parties are deſcribed.
                     1. By their place of abode: all that are in their graues: that is by a Synecdoche of one kind for all the reſt, by what manner of death ſo euer they died, and howſoeuer they were conſumed. This implies; That the conſumption of our bodies ſhall not hinder the reſurrection; becauſe the ground of it is the power of Chriſt, in regard of which there is no difference.
                     This ſerues for an encouragement againſt the diuers kindes of death whereunto we may come: as it was to the Martyrs: Heb. 11.30.
                     2. By their generality, [All] none, no not one ſhall bee forgotten in the graue: as appeares by the Parable of the Net that gathereth of all kindes: Matth. 13.47. Which is for the

comfort of thoſe which in this world haue been forgotten, none hath taken notice of them, theſe at the reſurrection, Chriſt will not forget. Secondly, it is for the terror of the wicked, that none of them ſhall eſcape. Thirdly, it teacheth vs to prepare our ſelues ſo in this life, that wee may riſe vnto ioy and glory.
                     3. The cauſe of the reſurrection is the voice of Chriſt [heare his voice:] that is, the voice of Chriſt; verſ. 27. they ſhall heare not in regard of any facultie, or ability in the dead, but of the powerfullnes of the voice of Chriſt, that peirceth euen to the duſt, and giueth a power of hearing vnto that which had none at all.
                     
                        Doct. The cauſe of the reſurrection is the almightines of the voice of Chriſt: 1. Theſ. 4.16. Act. 17.31.
                     
                        Obiect. 1. Theſ. 4.16. Matth. 25.31. this is attributed vnto an Archangell, &amp;c.
                     
                        Anſw. Theſe places indeed ſhew, that there ſhall bee a meanes vſed, and that an externall meanes by the miniſtery of Angells, like as there was in the giuing of the Law, but yet the efficacy, and force of this meanes, commeth from the power of Chriſt: as verſ. 25. it is the voice of Chriſt ſpeaking in his miniſters that conuerteth the heart: as 2. Cor. 13.3.
                     
                        Obiect. But how ſhall the wicked be raiſed vp by Chriſt ſith they haue no right vnto him?
                     
                        Anſw. We muſt conſider Chriſt in a double reſpect, as a Sauiour, or as a Lord; as a Redeemer, or as a Iudge. He raiſeth vp the righteous by vertue of his owne reſurrection, and of that vnion betweene him their Head, and they his Members: but the wicked he raiſeth by t
                           •
                        e almighty power of a Iudge, to bring them vnto Iudgement.
                     
                        
                           Ʋſe. Here we may note a difference betweene the faith of the Iewes, and of vs, in one and the ſame Article of Religion; they belieue the reſurrection only by the generall power of God, we by the power of Chriſt alſo.
                     2. This ſerues for a proppe to ſtrengthen and vphold our faith, in the doctrine of the reſurrection, if our reaſon ſhall diſpute againſt it: for it is moſt true that by na
                           •
                        urall reaſon and

argument, that the body once conſumed to duſt, ſhould riſe againe the ſame.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 29.
                           And they ſhall come forth that haue done good vnto the reſurrection of life: but they that haue done euill, vnto the reſurrection of condemnation.
                        
                     
                     IN this verſe is declared the iſſue of the reſurrection. In ſum, it is a declaration of the laſt Iudgement, or, of the diuers end of the good and of the wicked. Betweene whom there is here layd a compariſon; firſt, wherein they both agree. Secondly, wherein they differ.
                     1. The agreement is this: that there is a reſurrection belonging to both: as all lay in the graue, ſo all ſhall heare, and all ſhall come forth: but yet the one to life, the other to death.
                     
                        Doct. All that likenes and equality that is betweene the godly and the wicked before the laſt iudgement, ſhal not cauſe the fame end vnto both: as in the parable of the Tares, Mat. 13.30. Luk. 17.34, 35, 36. and therefore is that day called, a day of the declaration of the iuſt iudgement of God; Rom. 2.6. for God will then put a difference betweene the good and wicked, whatſoeuer the likenes betweene them hath been in this life.
                     
                        Vſe. To anſwere the ſcoffes of Atheiſts, who becauſe they ſee things fall alike to all, thinke it in vaine to ſerue God: as Eccleſ. 2.15. Iob 21.14.15. Mal. 3.14, 15. but ſee Pſal. 37.37. Eſay 3.10.
                     2. To taxe fond conceited men, that will deſire to be buried in ſuch a mans graue, or tombe, whom they hold for a good and holy man, that at the reſurrection they may receiue ſome benefit by him. Which is very ridiculous, although in ſome ciuill reſpect it may be deſired.
                     2. in the difference betweene them, note, firſt, the reward of the Righteous S
                           •
                        condly, the reuenge of the wicked [they that haue done good vnto the reſurrection of life.] Here obſerue, firſt, the Parties. Secondly, the Reward.
                     
                        1. The Parties are ſuch as haue done good: who are thoſe? not ſuch as build hoſpitalls, giue money to Friars and Monks, &amp;c. as the papiſts thinke. But there are foure things that concurre to bring it to paſſe, that a man may doe good,
                     1. The Partie that doth it. The rule is: That the perſon himſelfe muſt be good before the worke can be good. Tit. 1.15. Gen 4.4. God reſpected firſt Abel and then his offering. But how is the perſon good? In Chriſt the fountaine of goodnes: Eph. 1. Wherefore our workes are then good, when they come from vs as accepted of God in Chriſt, with whom we are vnited.
                     2. The matter of the worke: It is then good, when it is ſquared according to the rule of goodneſſe, viz. the Word of God: ſo that Actions framed according to Gods Will reuealed in his Word, are good.
                     3. The manner: which is the cheife, and giues beeing, to the reſt. The rules are, firſt, that as it is good in its owne nature, ſo it muſt be done of vs in that reſpect, that it is good; that is, in Conſcience and obedience to Gods commandement, becauſe he hath commanded vs: 1. Pet. 2.19. Rom. 13.5. Secondly, that in regard of our weakenes and infirmity, it bee done in humility, with deniall of our ſelues, and faith in Chriſt, to haue all the blemiſhes pardoned, all the defects couered; and what is wanting, to be perfected in him otherwiſe being done in a proud conceit of our owne worth, it is odious and abominable.
                     3. That it be done in vprightnes and ſincerity of heart, as to God who is Iudge of it: Ier. 17.10. and fourthly, that it be done as a worke of God; that is, which God hath appointed vnto vs, either in our generall, or particular Calling.
                     4. The end that we muſt aime, firſt, at the glory of God. Secondly, The good of man. And from hence may we ſee, who they be that doe good.
                     2. The ſecond thing is the Reward [of life] namely of eternall life; as Dan. 12.2. Matth. 25. laſt verſe.
                     Let vs conſider what this life is; it is, in a word, our Communion with God: that is, a coniunction of ſoule and body with

him. From whence ariſe theſe prerogatiues.
                     1. A continuall enioying of the glorious preſence of God, in as glorious and full manner, as the creature is capable of. A happy thing it was for the ſeruants of Salomon alwaies to behold his glory; 1. King. 10.8. and a great fauour for Moſes to ſee but the backe parts of the Lord. How great then will bee the glory, when God ſhall in ſuch ſpeciall manner communicate himſelfe to vs: Ioh. 3.2. and be all in all vnto vs. Reu. 21.22.23.
                     2. A fellowſhip and communion with the glorious Angels and Saints.
                     3. An abſolute perfection of ſoule and body, and of all the powers of both, perfect knowledge, perfect wiſedome; 1. Cor. 13.12. ſo that all things ſhall be done in that manner, as they could not haue been done better. In ſoule, ſuch integrity, as no defect; in body, immortality, incorruptibility, agility, and finally, a glorious body like vnto the body of Chriſt: 1. Cor. 15.42.
                     4. A full perfect and abſolute contentedneſſe that we ſhall not ſee what more to deſire: ſo that nothing can be added to our happineſſe.
                     5. A full redemption from all manner of miſery whatſoeuer, eſpecially that miſery of miſeries from ſinning againſt God. The expectation of which freedome is it, that in this life doth refreſh the ſoule of a Chriſtian, groaning vnder the burden of ſinne.
                     6. An admirable ioy and delight in this happineſſe, which indeed giues life to all the reſt: for it is better to be without honour, then to haue it with griefe and vexation.
                     7. That which makes vp the heape of all the reſt, is the perpetuity and euerlaſting continuance of them.
                     
                        Vſe is, firſt, to breed in our hearts an holy admiration of the goodneſſe of God, that hath prepared ſo great things for vs. Secondly, to ſtirre vp in vs a deſire of it, and in deſiring to vſe the meanes that leade vnto it.
                     The other part is the reuenge of wickedneſſe: wherein conſider,
                     
                        1. The Parties, they that haue done euill: who, not onely open ſinners, but all that commit an anomie, or tranſgreſſion againſt the Law; for then there is euill.
                     All that are not accepted of God in Chriſt, whether Pagans and Infidels, or vnregenerate Chriſtians, all ignorant perſons, that know not the will of God. For if we draw a line without a rule, we through the peruerſeneſſe of our nature, ſhall draw it awry. All ſuperſtitious perſons that take their owne conceits, and mens traditions for a rule; or ſuch as doe good things for by-reſpects, all proud conceited iuſticiaries that doe truſt to their owne perfection, all hypocrites and diſſemblers, all buſie-bodies that doe thoſe things which belong not to them, all vaine-glorious perſons, and haters of their brethren.
                     For to make vſe of this, conſider the ſecond point, the iſſue of theſe men in their puniſhment, which conſiſteth, firſt, in the pronouncing of that fearefull ſentence, Goe yee, &amp;c. Secondly, in the execution of it, the horror of which is vnconceaueable and vnutterable; for beſides the priuation of happineſſe, there is a fellowſhip with the Diuell and the damned, all horror and vglineſſe, nothing good in ſoule or in body, no comfort, and which aggrauates the terror of all, eternall continuance of this woe.
                     Vſe is therefore, that if that which hath been ſaid of life doe not allure vs, that this doe terrifie vs.
                     Here are now to be anſwered two queſtions that ariſe from theſe words.
                     
                        Queſt. 1. Whether the good which we doe, be the proper cauſe of ſaluation?
                     
                        Anſw. No: the beſt good that the beſt can doe, is no cauſe of their ſaluation: Gal. 2.16. Epheſ. 2.8, 9. Tit. 3.5.
                     
                        Reaſon. For life eternall is the free gift of God; Rom. 6. laſt. and if it be of Grace, it is not of work: Rom. 11.6. Eph. 2.6, 7, 8.
                     2. Suppoſe wee did all that God requires; yet we merit not, ſith all is but our duty: Luk. 17.10. yea, Adam if hee had continued in his integrity, and full performance of the whole Law of God, yet had he not thereby merited Heauen, it being but his duty ſo to doe: then much leſſe we, whoſe righteouſneſſe

is as a filthy clout: Eſay 64.6.
                     3. All our workes are imperfect, and ſo cannot merit: for if wee our ſelues can finde many imperfections in the beſt of them, God can finde much more; Iob 9.15, 30, 31. Yet is life eternall attributed to our workes, as they are ſignes and euidences of the ſoundneſſe and truth of our Faith in Chriſt, by whom we obtaine the ſame. And ſecondly, there is a twofold reward; the one of debt, the other of fauour, called the reward of inheritance.
                     
                        Vſe. The vſe of this point, is to teach vs rightly to diſtinguiſh of workes, and to know their right end, that we be neither arrogant and conceited, nor yet prophane and negligent of them.
                     
                        Queſt. 2. Whether euill workes be properly cauſes of condemnation.
                     
                        Anſw. Yea: as meriting and deſeruing it properly: for damnation is the wages of ſinne.
                     
                        Obiect. But how can that be, ſeeing the puniſhment is greater then the ſinne: the puniſhment infinite, and the ſinne but finite.
                     
                        Anſw. The puniſhment is not greater then the offence: for the offence muſt be weighed according to the greatneſſe of the perſon offended: now this is God, who is infinite, and accordingly his wrath infinite.
                     Sinne therefore is infinite in meaſure, though not in time but the puniſhment is infinite, not in meaſure, but in continuance. For the Creature is not able to beare the whole wrath of God at once (as Chriſt did,) and therefore it lyeth vnder the burden thereof eternally.
                     What then is the difference betweene good and euill workes.
                     
                        Anſw. Sinne is perfectly and fully euill: but the good workes we doe, are not perfectly good, vnleſſe they were done euery way according to all things commanded, and ſo were fully anſwerable to the Law of God, which we cannot doe.
                     In the laſt place, conſider wee ſome few inſtructions that ariſe from the manner of laying downe theſe words.
                     1. [They that haue done good.] Doct. Not the abſtaining

from euill, but the doing of good is that which cauſeth the reſurrection vnto life.
                     In Mat. 25. are three arguments to proue this point: firſt, that of the fiue fooliſh Virgins that wanted oyle, Verſ. 3. Secondly, that of the vnfaithfull ſeruant who was puniſhed, not becauſe he had purloyned, or ſtole any thing, but for not imploying of his Talent, Verſ. 25 &amp;c.
                     3. The tenor of the ſentence: which is pronounced according to workes done, or omitted, Verſ. 35. &amp;c. Pſalm. 34.14. 1. Pet. 3.10.
                     For herein doth the Image of God conſiſt, that wee bee renewed in our mindes, and that we put on the new man, as well as put off the old.
                     
                        Vſe. It ſerues for reproofe of the greater ſort of men, who thinke it ſufficient if they be not thus and thus, though in the meane time, as touching workes of Faith, Piety and Charity, they haue none.
                     2. [They that haue done good.] And Doct. The good. [they that haue done euill.] And euill that in this life is done, is a ſigne and euidence, either of life, or of condemnation: 2. Cor. 5.10. [In his body] whileſt hee liued: Luk. 16.25. [In thy life time] for this life is but as a probation time.
                     
                        Vſe. See Galat. 6.10. Eccleſ. 9.10. 2. Corinth. 6.2. Hebr. 2.13, 15.
                     3. Doct. Conſider what it is that Chriſt here vrgeth as an euidence of life eternall: it is the practice of good works, not the Profeſſion.
                     Which ſerues to reprooue vaine Profeſſors.
                     4. [Reſurrection of life.]
                     [Reſurrection of condemnation] That there is a difference betweene the good and the wicked, we haue heard. Here we ſee what it is: euen the greateſt contrariety that can bee: Mark. 16.16.
                     Which muſt incourage vs in our Chriſtian courſe, that howſoeuer the wicked may ſeeme in many things to be better then we, yet there ſhall be a difference hereafter.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 30.
                           I can doe nothing of mine owne ſelfe, as I heare, I iudge; and my iudgement is iust, becauſe I ſeeke not mine owne will, but the will of the Father who hath ſent me.
                        
                     
                     IN this Verſe is laid downe the condition of Chriſts iudgement; to wit, that it is a iuſt iudgement; that hee iudgeth according to equity. This is confirmed by that communion that is betweene the Father and Him. The Argument is this: That which the Father doth, ordereth, and willeth, that is lawfull and iuſt. But the Father iudgeth with me, he directeth my iudgement, and conſenteth thereunto. Therefore my iudgement is iuſt. The propoſition is omitted, as granted of the Iewes: the aſſumption and concluſion are here ſet downe. The aſſumption in three points:
                     1. In that he can doe nothing without his Father, [I can doe nothing of mine owne ſelfe.]
                     2. In that the Father ordereth the courſe of this iudgement; [as I heare, I iudge.]
                     3. Firſt, negatiuely, in that hee ſeeketh not his owne will. Secondly, affirmatiuely, in that he ſeeketh the will of him that ſent him.
                     The concluſion in theſe, [and my iudgement is iust.]
                     So that this Verſe, as it is a further proofe of the point in queſtion; ſo is it likewiſe a concluſion by way of repetition of all the former arguments.
                     Meaning of the words, [I can doe nothing, &amp;c.] Namely, as Verſ. 17.19. with this difference, that there he ſpeaketh in the third, here in the firſt. For hauing prooued it to bee true in a third perſon, leſt they ſhould miſtake, he doth now apply it to himſelfe.
                     
                        Heare] ſee Verſe 19.

                        Becauſe I ſeeke not, &amp;c.] Not as if Chriſt his will were opſite to his Fathers; for then he ſhould deny his will, as we doe: but this doth ſhew a correſpondency betweene the will of the Sonne, and of the Father. As if hee had ſaid, I ſeeke not mine

owne will, without the will of my Father; but in ſeeking of his will, I ſeeke mine owne.
                     2. Chriſt ſpeaketh this according to the conceit of the Iewes, who tooke Chriſt but for a man, and thought that hee herein followed but his owne fancy.
                     The parts then of this Verſe are;
                     1. A Propoſition in theſe words, My iudgement is iuſt.
                     
                     2. A Confirmation of it, drawne from the communion that is betweene Chriſt and God the Father. This is expreſſed in three branches.
                     
                        1. A ioynt Cooperation of both together.
                        2. A mutuall Communication of counſell.
                        3. A Correſpondency of their will.
                     
                     The Propoſition is laid in the middeſt, and not before the reaſons, nor yet after: which Chriſt wiſely doth.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 31.
                           If I ſhould beare witneſſe of my ſelfe, my witneſſe were not true.
                        
                     
                     WEe haue heard how in this Chapter, Chriſt doth proue himſelfe to be God; firſt, by a miracle. Secondly, by a diuine Apology occaſioned by the miracle. In which Apologie he confirmeth it by two ſorts of arguments; firſt, by diuine effects, ſuch as cannot be done, but by God himſelfe. Secondly, by diuine Teſtimonie. This we are now come to handle; and it is layd downe from the verſe 31. to the end.
                     The Teſtimonie is firſt, generally declared verſ. 32.
                     2. Particularly ſet forth in foure diſtinct inſtances, the firſt, of Iohn Baptiſt. verſ. 33.34.25. Secondly, of Chriſt his workes. verſ. 36. Thirdly, of the Father; verſ. 37, 38. and laſty, of the Scriptures, verſ. 39, &amp;c.
                     But before he come to the teſtimonies it ſelfe, Chriſt doth firſt lay downe the occaſion of vſing of this kind of argument; which is to preuent, and meete with a ſecret obiection, which the Iewes might make on this wiſe, viz.
                     
                     That thoſe great &amp; excellent things, which before he had ſpoken

of himſelfe, might well be ſuſpected, and called into queſtion; becauſe they concerned himſelfe, and himſelfe did auouch them of himſelfe. Now their readines to make ſuch an obiection, appeareth by Cap. 8.13. where they doe it plainly vpon the like occaſion. Therefore to preuent this, Chriſt brings in other teſtimonies which might witneſſe the ſame things of him, which himſelfe had ſpoken.
                     This muſt be noted for the reconciling of a contradiction, which ſeemes to be betweene this place, and chap: 8. verſ. 14. For in that place Chriſt ſpeaketh litterally, and according to the truth of the thing; namely, that as he was indeed God, ſo albeit he had no other teſtimonie, yet was his owne ſufficient in his owne cauſe: but in this place he ſpeaketh by a Rhetoricall conceſſion and grant, according to the conceit of the Iewes touching him, that he was but a man and no more. Now then the witnes of a man in his owne cauſe, although it may be true, yet is not ſufficient to decide the matter.
                     Obſerue then here, firſt, What Chriſt yeelded vnto, Secondly, Vpon what ground.
                     
                        Doct. Our Lord, Chriſt Ieſus, for the further confirmation of the truth, and ſatisfaction of the hearers, yeeldeth from that which he might haue ſtood vpon: Though hee might haue ſtood vpon his owne teſtimonie as ſufficient, he being God; yet becauſe this was not ſo clearely euident, vnto them, hee bringeth in other teſtimonies and grounds for the confirming of this truth, that were more plaine and eaſie to their appprehenſion. So Mat. 17.26.27. he yeeldeth from his right, hauing other meanes to manifeſt himſelfe to be the Sonne of God: and Mat. 26.53. hee might haue called for Legions of Angels.
                     For Chriſt ſought not himſelfe and his owne glory Ioh 8.50. but the glory of God, by giuing euidence vnto the truth, and the edification of the hearers. Which ſhewes, firſt, Chriſt his great meekenes, euen againſt his aduerſaries; and his great deſire to bring them to the knowledge of the truth. He might hau
                           •
                         only deliuered the truth, &amp; being God, haue exacted credence on paine of eternal cōdemnation; but he conſidereth our

weakenes, and ſo imitateth God his Father, who not only com
                           •
                        andeth, but bringeth with all arguments and reaſons, to ſhew the equity of his Lawes, to the end to perſwade vs to yeeld obedience. Secondly, it is for our Imitation, that as occaſion offereth it ſelfe, we be ready to yeeld from our right, and not ſtand to ſtrictly on euery thing that may be iuſtified, if by other meanes the truth may bee the better perſwaded and taught.
                     2. The ground vpon which he yeeldeth is, that if hee had been man, as they conceited him to be, then his owne teſtimonie had not been ſufficient.
                     
                        Doct. None are to iuſtifie themſelues and their actions, and to commend the things which they doe. For if Chriſt, who was free from an ouerweening conceit of his owne doings, from vaine glory, and deſire of applauſe, and whoſe teſtimonie was moſt true, would not yet commend himſelfe; how much leſſe may we, who are partiall in our owne matters and ſubiect to the other vices? Prou. 27.2.
                     For, firſt, If we commend our ſelues, it miniſters occaſion that our teſtimonie ſhould be ſuſpected; and it is hard but we ſhall mingle ſome vntruth, either in ſuppreſſing ſome circumſtances which might diſgrace vs, or amplifying other hyperbolically which tend to our honour.
                     2. It ſauours of a deſire of vaine glory.
                     3. If we do things that are indeed praiſe-worthy, it is needleſſe; for they will commend themſelues.
                     
                        Vſe. For reproofe of thoſe that ſtand ſo much vpon their owne credit, that they will haue euery thing ſo, becauſe they ſay it: as doth the Pope, who what he ſaies, ſitting in his chaire, men are bound in conſcience to beleeue: herein making himſelfe like God: 2. Theſ. 2.4. And as do many, who though they deliuer a thing but vpon their owne authority, yet are offended if it bee called in queſtion. So much for the occaſion.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 32.
                           There is another that beareth witnes of mee, and I know that the witnes which he beareth of me is true.
                        
                     
                     WEe are now come to the point it ſelfe, viz. the Teſtimonies that are alleadged. Which are firſt propounded in generall in this 32. verſe, to be Diuine teſtimonies, The teſtimonies of God the Father himſelfe for that is meant: where he ſaith, There is another, that is, God the Father: not Iohn, as ſome ſay; for Chriſt would here bring in an vndeniable teſtimonie.
                     But how is God another from Chriſt?
                     
                        Anſw. In foure reſpects. Firſt in regard of the Iewes conceit, that Chriſt was but a man: ſo is God another. Secondly, in regard of his Humane Nature: for though both make one perſon, yet the Diuine Nature is one, and the Humane Nature another.
                     3. In regard of his Office, as he was Mediator betweene God and Man, ſo hee may bee ſaid to bee another then God. Fourthly, in regard of his perſon, as he is God, being a diſtinct perſon from the Father: ſo is the Father 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , but not 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        .
                     The meaning then is this, as if Chriſt had ſaid; You except againſt my teſtimonie, as a humane teſtimony; but I haue a diuine teſtimonie of theſe things, euen the teſtimonie of God himſelfe, who by Iohn, by his owne voice, by his workes, And by his word, doth beare witnes vnto mee.
                     The Generall then of this verſe is this; That thoſe things which Chriſt had deliuered, were confirmed by diuine teſtimonie.
                     The points to be noted are, firſt, Who it is that beareth witnes. Another, that is God.
                     
                        Doct. The teſtimonie whereby Chriſt doth iuſtifie himſelfe and his actions, and vpon which he doth reſt, is the teſtimonie of God: Ioh. 8.14, 18.
                     For firſt, he would not ſtand vpon his owne teſtimonie as is before handled: and ſecondly, this teſtimonie is vncontrouleable; as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.
                     
                        
                        Vſe. Here wee learne whereon to reſt, and ground our actions, viz. vpon the teſtimonie of God, and his approbation: 2. Cor. 10. laſt. For men may deceiue through flattery, and be deceiued through ignorance: but God can neither. And better it is to ſeeke for the app
                           •
                        obation of the maſter, then of the ſeruant.
                     2. The kind of Teſtimonie: wherein we may obſerue two points.
                     
                        1. The thing it ſelfe; It is a true teſtimony.
                        2. The manner of ſetting it downe. [I know, &amp;c.]
                     
                     1. Doct. The witnes which God doth giue, is an infallible certaine true witnes: for God is truth; both actiuely declaring only the truth with falſhod without error, and paſſiuely, becauſe he cannot be deceiued he is truth in abſtracto: Exod. 34.6. Pſal. 31.5. Tit. 1.2. Heb. 6.18.
                     
                        Vſe. We heard before, that we were to ſeeke for Gods witnes and approbation of the things we do. This now is a motiue to vrge vs thereto, becauſe his witneſſe is without exception. Rom. 8.31.
                     2. Chriſt in ſetting downe this teſtimony, ſheweth his aſſured perſwaſion, and ſetled faith in it, and this from his owne experience that hee had found it ſo. [I know:] hereby, firſt, ſhewing that hee went vpon ſure and certaine grounds in all that he did. Secondly, checking the Iewes infidelity.
                     
                        Doct. The witneſſe of God is ſo effectuall and powerfull, that it worketh credence in thoſe to whom it is giuen: Iob 16.19.
                     Wherein ſtands a maine difference betweene a humane teſtimony, and a diuine teſtimony. For man, though hee may giue a teſtimony, which for the matter is true, yet hee cannot for the effect, to aſſure him to whom it is giuen, that hee may certainely know that it is true.
                     
                        Vſe. Apply we this teſtimony of Adoption, that they who haue it, doe know, and are aſſured of it: Rom. 8.15. Gal. 4.4.6.
                     2. Doct. Though others know not the teſtimony of God, yet we muſt not ſhrinke from it: as Chriſt doth here, Ioh.
                        
17.25. Ioh. 6.67, 69. Mat. 26.33. a good reſolution of Peter, had it not been in too much confidence and preſumption of himſelfe. Which holy and conſtant courage ought to be in vs all. So much for the Generall.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 33.
                           Yee ſent vnto Iohn, and hee bare witneſſe vnto the truth.
                        
                     
                     WE haue heard in generall, that Chriſt hath diuine teſtimony to confirme his authority, and equality with his Father.
                     Now in particular this is exemplified, and ſet forth in foure branches: firſt, by the teſtimony of Iohn, in this Vreſe vnto the 36. Verſe.
                     In which note,

                           1. The occaſion thereof; Verſ. 33.
                           2. The witneſſe it ſelfe; Verſ. 33.
                           3. The end of alleaging it; Verſ. 34.
                           4. The commendation of the witneſſe-bearer; Verſ. 35.
                        
                     
                     1. The occaſion is in theſe words; [Yee ſent vnto Iohn.] which pointeth vnto that ſolemne embaſſage which the Iewes ſent vnto Iohn: Ioh. 1.19, &amp;c. From whence note the good guiding and ouer-ruling power of God, who diſpoſeth of the actions of the aduerſaries of his truth, to the confirmation of the ſame truth: for it is likely they ſent not vnto Iohn with any good minde, but in hypocriſie; for ſo Iohn reproues them: yet doth Chriſt hereby confirme the truth of Iohns witneſſe. Shewing hereby, firſt, that this witn
                           •
                        ſſe came not voluntarily from Iohn, he went not vnto them to declare it, but they ſent an embaſſage vnto him, to aske him touching thoſe things. Secondly, that there was no compact betweene Iohn and Chriſt: for Iohn knew not Chriſt vntill after that time: Ioh. 1.29.
                     2. In the teſtimony it ſelfe note, firſt, the action; ſecondly, the obiect.
                     1. The action is in th
                           •

                        e vnto which he was appointed to be a

witneſſe-bearer: Ioh. 1.6, 7. Luk. 1.15, 76.
                     
                        Obiect. Act. 10.43. it is ſaid, all the Prophets were witneſſes of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles: Act. 1.8, 22. &amp; 3.5. &amp; 10.39, 41. how then was this proper to Iohn?
                     
                     
                        Anſw. In generall it is a common duty to all Miniſters: but Iohn was a more ſpeciall witneſſe, for that he firſt pointed out Chriſt, and declared him before he was knowne, going immediately before him, as a Herald before a King, as the Day-ſtar befo
                           •
                        e the Sunne.
                     2. The obiect is in theſe words [to the truth.]
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 35.
                           He was a burning and a ſhining candle, and yee would for a ſeaſon haue reioyced in his light.
                        
                     
                     IN this Verſe is ſet downe the commendation of the witnes-bearer: which Chriſt addeth, becauſe hee would not inſiſt vpon the teſtimony of Iohn, and lay the whole proofe vpon it. Now leſt he ſhould ſeeme to make light of Iohn, as one whoſe teſtimonie was nor ſo greatly to be regarded, he doth therefore here giue this high commendation of him. Whence wee ſee, that Chriſt as he doth maintaine his owne honour, ſo doth he not diſparage the honour of Iohn, but together with his, maintaineth his authority. Contrary to the practice of many, who enuie the credit of others, &amp;c. Now Iohn is commended,
                     1. From the condition of his office: He was a candle, and therefore not hauing light from himſelfe, but from another: ſhewing, that Miniſters are no other then ordinary men, vnleſſe they be illightned from God. And this teacheth people how to eſteeme aright of Miniſters, and yet not to deſpiſe them, ſeeing that a candle is neceſſary in the night.
                     2. From his properties: firſt, of burning, noting his inward zeale to the glory of God, and ſaluation of his people. Secondly, of ſhining, by his faithfull preaching, and godly life. A patter
                           •
                        e for all Miniſters.
                     3. From the effect of his miniſtery, the people reioyced,

though the wicked and hypocrites but for a ſeaſon. Here note firſt, the action, they reioyced; which is ſpoken, not ſo much in commendation of them, as to ſhew the efficacy of the miniſtery of Gods Word, that it workes euen vpon the obſtinate.
                     2. The Obiect; They reioyced in the light. To ſhew, that if Miniſters will haue the people to affect them, and to reioyce in their Miniſtery, they muſt ſhew forth the light of the Word, and the euidence of the Goſpell in their Miniſtery. And ſo no maruell though many are not regarded, who be as candles either not lighted, or elſe put vnder a buſhell. Now to ſhew that this reioycing is ſpoken more, to ſhew the powerfull effect of the miniſtery of the Word, then in commendation of them, hee addes a limitation, that this their ioy was but for a ſeaſon; as is the ioy of all hypocrites and wicked men: Iob. 20.5. ſee Mat. 13.19, 20. They reioyced in Iohn for by-reſpects, in hope that he would haue brought them liberty, and deliuered them from the Romanes, and the like: but when Iohn did plainely vnmaske their hypocriſie, and diſcouer their ſinnes, their ioy was nipt in the head, and withered. Which hath been the practiſe of people from all time, firſt, for a while greatly to admire a Miniſter; but when hee tells them of their ſinnes, and preſſeth their duties vpon them, Oh then he is too hard and too ſeuere, &amp;c. and ſo they forſake him.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 36.
                           But I haue greater witneſſe then the witneſſe of Iohn: for the workes which the Father hath giuen me to finiſh, the ſame workes that I doe, beare witneſſe of me, that the Father ſent me.
                        
                     
                     THis Verſe containes the ſecond teſtimony, that Chriſt doth alleadge, to prooue his equality with the Father; namely, the teſtimony of his workes. In ſetting downe whe
                           •
                        eof, firſt, he layes downe a commendation of it. Secondly, hee declares the nature and kind of it.
                     1. The commendation is taken from a compariſon of vnequalls, in that he ſaith; But I haue greater witnes, then, &amp;c. we

are to ſee wherein conſi
                           •
                        teth the inequality of this witnes, and the reſt that follow, (for this is a tranſition:) and of that former witne
                           •
                         of Iohn.
                     
                     It conſiſteth not in the truth of the witneſſes, for all teſtifie the ſame things, but the inequality is in regard, firſt, of the perſons bearing witnes, that were greater then Iohn. Secondly, of the teſtimonies themſelues that were more cleare, and euident, then the teſtimony of Iohn. For though Iohn being a man inſpired could not erre, yet the people did not, or would not ſo clearely ſee the truth of his teſtimonie. But theſe teſtimonies are both manifeſt and euident in themſelues, as alſo to the apprehenſion of the people. Hence note, that
                     
                        Doctr. In the confirmation of one and the ſame truth, there may bee teſtimonies, ſome greater ſome leſſer then other.
                     Becauſe a teſtimonie hath his credit from the dignity and credit of the witnes-bearer.
                     2. The witnes it ſelfe is taken from his workes. Chriſts workes were diuine workes: Therefore they witnes that he was God.
                     The Doctrine then in generall of this verſe is this: Chriſts workes were a ſure euidence of his diuine power, and that hee was God: as Ioh. 10.25. and 15.24. Ioh. 3.2. and 1.48.49. and 4.19.
                     For man cannot doe the workes of God.
                     
                        Obiect. But did not the Prophets doe miracles, and diuine workes, and alſo the Apoſtles?
                     
                        Anſ. Yea. But the difference betweene their works and the workes of Chriſt, ſtandeth in foure points, firſt in the workes themſelues. Chriſt made choice of ſuch workes, as for the kind, neuer any did before as to raiſe one dead foure dayes and ſtinking. To giue ſight to the blind: Ioh. 9.32. and the like. Secondly for the number neuer any did ſo many as Chriſt did: for he healed all that were brought, &amp;c. Thirdly, Chriſt ſtill as he cured the body, ſo he cured the ſoule.
                     2. The Prophets and Apoſtles were reſtrained, and could not doe miracles when they pleaſed, but when God permitted

them. As appeareth in the example of Eliſha: 2. King. 4.27.
                     But Chriſt did worke how and when it pleaſed him.
                     3. The workes which the Prophets and Apoſtles did, they did neither by their owne power and authority, nor in their owne name: Act. 3.12. But Chriſt did his works both by the one, and in the other.
                     4. The miracles which the Prophets and Apoſtles did, were to ſhew, that they were ſent of God and were his ſeruants and meſſengers. But there was a higher ſcope of Chriſts miracles, that they aimed at, namely to ſhew that he was the Sonne of God.
                     We ſee then how ſtrong an argument this is, and how well this witneſſe of his workes is brought for confirmation of his Godhead.
                     
                        Vſe is, firſt, that we reade not the miracles of Chriſt, as matters only of Hiſtory, but to take them as props for the ſtrengthening of our faith in Chriſt, whom they ſhew to be God, and ſo an al-ſufficient mediator.
                     2. To applie this to our adoption) that we ſhew our ſelues to be the Sonnes of God, by being partaker of the diuine nature, and doing the workes of God.
                     More Particularly we are to conſider

                           1. A deſcription of theſe workes.
                           2. A declaration of the witnes which they beare.
                        
                     
                     They are deſcribed in two clauſes:
                     1. [Which the Father hath giuen me to finiſh.] Which ſheweth, firſt, the ground. Secondly, the extent of theſe workes.
                     1. The ground of them is, becauſe they were ſuch workes, as the Father had giuen him in charge to doe: which ſhewes, that what Chriſt did, he did by authority &amp; commiſſion from his Father: a Doctrine heretofore noted, and it is a notable ground for the ſtrengthening of our Faith, becauſe God no doubt will accept of thoſe things that Chriſt did for vs, they being done by his authority. And ſecondly, it is for our imitation, that wee haue the warrant of God for the things wee doe. Now as this is a ground, ſo it is an end why Chriſt do
                           •
                        h

theſe workes; as Luk. 2.49. Ioh. 6.38. and before, verſ. 30. of this Chapter: Ioh. 4.34.
                     2. The extent is, that Chriſt was not onely to begin theſe workes, but to goe thorow with them, and finiſh them. Hence learne,
                     
                        Doct. That the worke that God hath giuen vs, is not done, till it be finiſhed. This Chriſt knew, and ſo he fully finiſhed the worke his Father gaue him: as Ioh. 4.34. &amp; 17.4. &amp; 19.30.
                     
                        Vſe. 1. For reproofe of the opinion of the Papiſts, that Chriſt did not perfectly finiſh his worke, but left ſome things for the Saints to adde thereunto; out of Col. 1.24.
                     2. We muſt obſerue, that in the worke of God, we adde vnto diligence and carefulneſſe, conſtancy and continuance.
                     The ſecond clauſe is [which I doe.] 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , that [I] is added 
                           •
                        mphatically, from whence the Doctrine is, that
                     
                        Doct. What Chriſt did, he did by his owne power. This did the people obſerue in all his Miracles, how he by his owne authoritie, and in his owne Name, did caſt out Diuels, forgiue ſinnes, teach the people, &amp;c.
                     
                        Doct. Whence we learne, that Chriſt is to bee acknowledged, adored, worſhipped, beleeued, and truſted in, as one that is abſolute of himſelfe to doe what he will. And thus are not Saints to be truſted vnto, who are only the inſtruments of God.
                     2. The Witnes which theſe workes doe beare, is expreſſed in theſe words, [That the Father ſent me.] Now where Chriſt vrgeth this ſending, as a proofe of his equality with the Father, we muſt vnderſtand it of ſuch a ſending, as when an Equall is ſ
                           •
                        nt, and not an Inferior; of the ſending of a Sonne, not of a Seruant or Meſſenger.
                     This Phraſe of being ſent, is applied to Chriſt in three reſpects: 1. In regard of diſtinction of Perſons, of the Father and the Sonne.
                     2. In regard of Chriſts Incarnation, who being in Heauen in the boſome of his Father, was ſent to take fleſh vpon him here in earth.
                     3. In regard of his Office, as he is Mediatour betweene God and Man, and therevnto ſent, and deputed by God.
                     
                        This ſhewes, that Chriſt did not vſurpe any authority and dignity of himſelfe, but had this by communication from God the Father. A point before noted.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 37.
                           And the Father himſelfe, which hath ſent me, beareth witnes of me. Ye haue not heard his voice at any time, neither haue yee ſeene his ſhape.
                           
                              Verſ. 38.
                           And his word haue you not abiding in you: for whom he hath ſent, him yea beleeue not.
                        
                     
                     IN theſe words is layd downe the third teſtimonie, viz. the witneſſe of God the Father. Wherein obſerue:
                     1. How Chriſt doth plainly lay downe the teſtimonie.
                     2. How he reproues the Iewes vnbeleife.
                     In the former, we are to note,
                     1. The Party that giues this teſtimonie; who is deſcribed by a twofold relation to him, to whom the witnes is giuen.
                     1. Of Father. [The Father himſelfe:] ſhewing that this was the firſt perſon in Trinity.
                     2. Of ſending. Noting that Chriſt was come from the Father. So that this teſtimony of the Father is, That Chriſt is his Sonne.
                     2. The witneſſe it ſelfe [beareth witneſſe of me.] But when, and how was this teſtimonie giuen?
                     
                        Anſw. God the Father giueth teſtimonie to his Sonne foure waies.
                     1. by his Prophets; Heb. 1.1. Act. 10.43. and 3.18.
                     2. By inward reuelation and inſpiration, when God by his Spirit aſſureth mens hearts, that Chriſt Ieſus is his Sonne; as he did to Peter: Mat. 16.17.
                     3. By the teſtimonie of Chriſt himſelfe; Ioh. 3.33. for in that Chriſt giueth teſtimonie of himſelfe, God the Father alſo doth it.
                     4. In his owne perſon by his voice. Firſt at his baptiſme; Mat. 3.17. [and at two other times, at his transfiguration: Mat. 17.5. and Ioh. 12.28.] And this is here principally meant:

for the firſt, that is, the teſtimony of the Prophets, comes next to be handled; the ſecond is ſecret: now Chriſt would bring ſuch a teſtimony, as all might take notice of. And for the third that i
                           •
                         the point in queſtion to be proued.
                     Here, then we are diligently to weigh the greatnes of this teſtimonie and in it to note the great goodnes of God, and the care that he hath of vs. For this being the ground of all the Articles of our Religion, viz. that Chriſt is the Son of God, without which there can be no comfort in beleeuing of any. God was not contented to haue declared this by his Prophets, yea or by Chriſt himſelfe; but himſelfe from Heauen in his owne perſon doth aſſure vs of the truth of this ſo neceſſary an Article of Faith, that Chriſt Ieſus is his owne Sonne, in whom he is well pleaſed with vs. And therefore of all teſtimonies of Scripture this among the reſt, and aboue all the reſt is to be regarded as a moſt ſure and ſtrong prop of our Faith. And this vſe Peter teacheth vs to make: when from hence hee bringeth a ſtrong argument to confirme the truth of the Goſpell. 2. Pet 1.16, 17, 18.
                     The vſe is the ſame that is made, Mat. 17.5. Deut. 18.15. Act. 7.37. that therefore we do heare Chriſt, by attendi
                           ••
                         vnto his Word, which he hath cauſed to be written for the 
                           •••
                        uation of his Church. So much to the teſtimonie.
                     2. In his repoofe note, firſt, The fault for which he reproues them. The ground of this fault.
                     1. The fault is noted in theſe words [yee haue not heard his voice at any time neither haue yee ſeene his ſhape.] Which words may be taken, firſt, litterally: That they neuer heard the voice of the firſt perſon ſpeaking by himſelfe at any time, that is, at any other time, except then, and vpon that occaſion when hee gaue teſtimonie to his Sonne. Neither yet did, or can any man behold God with carnall eyes. So that this, firſt, amplifies the greatneſſe of this teſtimony, that it is a matter of great weight, ſith neuer before, nor ſince, the like teſtimony hath been giuen. Secondly, it ſhewes what a great benefit it was, that Chriſt was incarnate, who is the character and ingraued forme of the Father, in whom we may ſee and behold him: Heb. 1.3.
                     
                        2. Metaphorically, and to this ſenſe I rather agree: and then it is a prouerbiall kind of ſpeech taken from men, whereby Chriſt doth taxe their ignorance and vnacquaintance with God. For men are knowne two wayes, by their ſpeech, and by their ſhape. Now they had neither heard the voice, nor ſeene the ſhape of God, and ſo were without all knowledge and acquaintance with him, and ſo in this reſpect like Heathen men. All the meanes that God affoorded for the declaration of his preſence among them, his voyce that hee cauſed to bee ſounded forth by the miniſtery of his Prophets, by Chriſt, yea by himſelfe extraordinarily, they regarded not, but ſtill remained ignorant. Like vnto theſe Iewes, are many among vs; that notwithſtanding the preaching of the Word, remaine ſtill in their ignorance, &amp;c.
                     The ground of this ignorance is ſet downe in theſe words, [and his Word haue you not abiding in you.] This Chriſt ſaith to preuent an obiection which they might make, viz. That they had the Law, the Sacrifices, the Word preached in their Synagogues, &amp;c. and therefore were not ſo ignorant as he blamed them.
                     Wherefore Chriſt taxeth in them two things, that the Word was indeed preached among them, and they heard, the ſound of it with their eares, but it went not vnto their hearts. Secondly, that if at any time it peirced to the heart, yet it did not there abide.
                     
                        Doct. It is not ſufficient to haue the Word amongſt vs, to heare it, to talke of it, and the like, vnleſſe it be in our hearts, and abide there, all is worth nothing. Though Moſes were read euery day in the Synagogue, it profited the Iewes nothing, becauſe they vnderſtood it not; they were not affected with it, vnleſſe for a ſhort time, they made it no rule of their life to walke by. See Luk. 11.28. Col. 3.16.
                     This ſhews we haue an honeſt and good heart, if the Word abides with vs, and we practiſe it; and on the contrary ſide, an euill corrupt heart. Euen as it fares with a man of a good, or ill-affected ſtomack, that either retaines the meate, and digeſts it, or vomits it vp againe, or turnes it into humours.
                     
                        Now that the VVord may abide with vs, obſerue theſe rules drawne out of the Parable, Luk. 8.
                     1. That wee vſe the meanes to vnderſtand, and come to knowledge of the VVord. This was the fault of the firſt ground, the ſeed therein had no entrance at all.
                     2. That we loue and delight in the VVord, that we make it our ioy, that we reliſh and affect it: for hauing knowledge, and feeling the ſweetneſſe of it, we ſhall be the more deſirous of it, without weariſomneſſe, without loathing. From the want of this, it is, that many men of great learning are yet carried away, becauſe their knowledge was onely in the braine, and not rooted in the heart. Like the ſecond ground.
                     3. That we ſuffer the VVord to rule vs wholy, and not entertaine our luſts, pleaſures, and worldly care together with it: for theſe will ſucke out the life of the VVord: ſo that it will not abide with vs long; as in the third ſort of ground.
                     4. That we haue a care to make it a rule vnto vs, to ſquare our life according to it, then will it abide with vs: for a good conſcience is the ſhip wherein Faith is preſerued from ſuffering wracke: 1. Tim. 1.19. and we ſee, that error in iudgement, and corruption in manners doe mutually infect one another.
                     The confirmation of this ground is expreſſed in theſe words [for whom he hath ſent, him yee beleeue not.
                     
                     The VVord of God did not abide in them; and why? becauſe they did not beleeue in Chriſt the Sonne of God, whom he had ſent. The truth of this reaſon appeares in two reſpects;
                     1. Becauſe Chriſt, who was ſent of God, was the ſumme and ſubſtance of the VVord of God, both of the Law, and of the Prophets; Heb. 8.1. Act. 10.43. whom principally it aimed to declare. Now then how is it poſſible that they could haue the VVord abiding in them, who did not entertaine and beleeue in Chriſt when he was come.
                     2. Becauſe they receiued not Chriſt, who ſpake the words of God. Now if they had the Word of God abiding in them, they would haue beleeued in him, who had brought this Word vnto them.
                     
                        Doct. The Word abides in none that beleeue not Chriſt

Ieſus. Which firſt, is againſt all ſuch as know not Chriſt, or deny him, or rely not vpon him.
                     Secondly, it teacheth vs to lay ſure hold on Chriſt.
                     Thirdly, it ſhewes that they that deſpiſe the Word, and the Miniſter thereof, haue it not abiding in them.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 39.
                           Search the Scriptures: for in them yee thinke to haue eternall life, and they are they which teſtifie of me.
                        
                     
                     THeſe words containes the fourth and laſt teſtimony, which Chriſt alleadgeth for confirmation of his diuine power and authority. Now it ſeemeth that Chriſt obſerueth an order in ſetting downe theſe teſtimonies; firſt, to lay downe the leſſe, and then the greater. So that indeed this teſtimony of the Scripture is the greateſt of all the reſt. Not as was before noted, that there is any difference in regard of the truth of them; but in regard of the euidence and cleareneſſe thereof. This the Apoſtle Peter ſhewes, 2. Pet. 1.19. where hauing alleadged the former teſtimonie of the voice of God the Father, verſ. 17.18. and comming to ſpeake of the teſtimony of the Scriptures, he ſaith [we haue a more ſure word of the Prophets.] It is greater then in theſe reſpects: firſt, in regard of the long continuance of this witneſſe, that it hath been a teſtimony giuen of Chriſt from before ſo many ages, and ſo receiued by the Fathers, and approoued from time to time, as a certaine ground of Faith.
                     2. The very writing and recording doth adde weight vnto it, ſeeing that the Scriptures alſo are the voice of God, as wel as that which we haue before ſpoken of.
                     3. Becauſe this teſtimony doth more diſtinctly and fully ſet forth Chriſt vnto vs, then any of the former doe; deſcribing him in his nature, actions, offices, death and ſuffering the benefit of it, and the meanes whereby wee come to be partakers of it.
                     4. This very Oracle, and alſo the workes of Chriſt, are now written and recorded, and ſo come vnto vs vnder the nature of

the teſtimonie of the Scriptur

                        erue the generall ſcope and drift of Chriſt in this place, which is, to make the Scripture the Iudge, whether himſelfe had done and ſpoken well or no; vnto it therefore he referres his aduerſaries, reſting himſelfe vpon the iudgement thereof.
                     Hence ariſeth this Doctrine, that

Tim. 3.16. and ſo in many places it is called a Law, Statute, Ordinance, and Iudgement; becauſe it doth declare the Will and Councell of God, which he hath pronounced and dec
                           •
                        eed. Thus Chriſt hath alwayes recourſe vnto the Scripture, determining all queſtions by them; as Matth. 12.3, 5. &amp; 22.29. and the Apoſtles, as Peter, Act. 2. Apollos, Act. 18. laſt.

                     2. Becauſe the Scripture is a true and perfect Rule that cannot erre, Pſal. 19. It is a ſufficient Iudge to decide all controuerſies whatſoeuer: and laſtly, it is an vnpart
                           •
                        all Iudge.
                     
                        Obiect. 1. Againſt this authority of the Scriptures, the Papiſts doe make many obiections, whereof wee will ſpeake of two onely. The Scripture, ſay th
                           •
                        y, is a mute Iudge, and cannot declare which is truth.
                     
                        Anſw. Though the Scripture cannot ſpeake with the voice of a man, yet it doth ſpeake as a Law doth ſpeake, declaring what is the will and counſell of God. And cannot wee vnderſtand the minde of a man as we
                           •
                        l by his writing, as by hearing of him ſpeake; and the rather, ſeeing we may the more ponder euery word. And yet the Scripture doth giue a mouth vnto the Scripture, if wee marke it w
                           •
                        ll; as Matth. 22.31. [what is ſpoken vnto you of God] how ſpake God vnto you, but by the Scriptures; Ioh. 7.42. [ſaith not, &amp;c.] Ioh. 19.24. [which ſaith;] and eſpecially that, Heb. 12.5. [which ſpeaketh, &amp;c.]
                     
                        Becauſe the Word written doth declare vnto vs the will of God as plainely, and as diſtinctly, as if God with audible voice did ſpeake vnto vs. Yea, if he ſhould ſpeake, he would ſpeake no otherwiſe, then that which is in the Scriptures. And ſo a
                           •
                        e they ſaid to ſpeake vnto vs.
                     
                        Obiect. 2. Heretikes, ſay they, make the Scripture their Iudge, and how then can it be a Iudge of truth?
                     
                        Anſw. This obiection, though commonly alleag
                           •

                           •
                        hem, to weaken the authority of the Scripture; yet if we well conſider it, it doth very ſtrongly prooue the ſame. A contentious man when he will wrong his neighbour in any matter, he will pleade the Law for his right vnto his neighbors goods, as knowing, that without the ſentence of the Law hee cannot enioy them. Now this ſhewes, that therefore the Law is the onely Iudge that muſt decide this matter. So in that Heretikes themſelues for to vphold their doctrine, doe relye vpon the Scriptures, as without which they muſt needs faile in their cauſe, it is a very ſtrong proofe, that therefore the Scripture ought to be the onely Iudge to determine of all matters of controuerſie. Againe, though Scripture haue been alleaged by Heretikes, yet did euer Scripture determine with, and for an Heretike?
                     
                        Vſe 1. To reprooue thoſe vaine, opprobrious, and bl

                        ſphemous titles, that Papiſts giue vnto the Scripture of a leaden Rule, &amp;c. Preferring the determination of Popes and Councels before the Scripture: which is to preferre man before 
                           •
                        od.
                     2. It teacheth vs in all doubts and matters of controuerſie touching Faith, Religion, and Manners, to reſort vnto the Word and hereon to haue our iudgement grounded and ſetled. Not taking any thing either for article of Faith, or rule of life that is not warranted by it. So much of the generall.
                     The words doe naturally, diuide themſelues into two parts:

                           1. A Precept.
                           2. Reaſons to confirme it.
                        
                     
                     The Precept is in theſe words [Search the Scriptures.] From

whence the Doctrine ariſing is this,
                     
                        Doct. The Scriptures doe require ſtudy and diligence, for the finding out of the meaning of them, and ſearching out the treaſures hid in them.
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                         the Imperatiue, as moſt tranſlations doe, for a precept and duty, then in the Indicatiue, for a commendation of them; noting what they did: as if he had ſayd [ye ſearch the Scripture,] &amp;c. yet both waies the Doctrine is ſound.
                     
                        Search.] It is a Metaphor taken from ſuch as ſearch for gold and ſiluer Ore in the earth; who will not caſt it away by whole ſhouell fuls, but will ſearch, and ſift, and breake euery clod to find out the gold. To this diligence in ſearching the Scripture, doth the Apoſtle exhort Timothy, 1. Tim. 4.13. and Salomon vſeth the ſame Metaphor; Pro. 2.4. Act. 17.11. the ſame word. This diligence is often vrged in the old Teſtament by the phraſe of meditating in the Word; as Iosh. 1.8. Pſ. 1.2. &amp; paſſim alibi.
                     
                     The Reaſons to moue vs hereunto, beſides thoſe here mentioned in the text, of which wee ſhall ſpeake anon, are two:
                     1. The little hope of getting any good by the Scriptures, without ſearching into them.
                     2. The aſſured hope to get much good by ſearching. For the former, we muſt know, that God is hid in the Scripture, as gold is in the earth; and ſo is not found out at the firſt ſight, but after a diligent ſearch. Curſory reading may giue knowledge of the ſtory, and of ſuch things as are at the firſt ſight eaſie and plaine: but yet it yeeldeth little, or no profit. For theſe Iewes, who had the Word amongſt them, heard it, and read it in their Synagogue euery Sabba
                           •
                        h, made no profit by it, they found not the treaſure hid in them; Chriſt Ieſus, him they knew not, and therefore Chriſt bids yet ſearch.
                     
                        Obiect. But how can this ſtand with this perſpicuity, and plainneſſe that we affirm to be in the Scripture againſt the Papiſts.
                     
                        
                        Anſw. We muſt well vnderſtand, how the Scriptures ar
                           •
                         plaine, and how obſcure. Firſt, to carnal men they are obſcure, who diſcerne not ſpirituall things: but not ſo to th
                           •
                        ſe that are inlightened by the Spirit of God.
                     2. Neither is this obſcurity in the Scriptures themſelues, but becauſe the god of this world hath blinded their eyes, that they cannot ſee.
                     3. In the maine grounds of ſaluation it is cleare and plaine: yea, in all, to thoſe that are carefull and diligent, it is eaſie. For ſo the promiſe is, Prou. 2.3.4. and 14 but vnto the careleſſe nothing is plaine.
                     The reaſons why God hath thus hidden his wiſedome in his Word, may be theſe. Firſt, to diſcouer vnto vs our ignorance, that when we ſee how many great myſteries wee are ignorant of, we may be humbled. Secondly, That he might make a difference betweene thoſe that ſeeke him in truth, and thoſe that contemne him, who like Hogs and Dogs regard not Pearles. Wherefore he hath alſo hidden them from ſuch. Thirdly, that God might maintaine his ordinances and we might th
                           •
                        rein be helpfull one to another, by preaching, by inſtructing, &amp;c. Fourthly, to make vs the more earneſtly deſire and long after the knowledge of his Word. Fiftly and laſtly, to bring vs to the performance of this duty here preſcribed, to ſearch, and ſearch againe, that the more we ſearch, the more we may finde.
                     2. Now for our encouragement, conſider the ſecond reaſon, viz. that our labour ſhall not be loſt, but much rich treaſure is certainly to be found by ſearching. Therefore is the Law ſayd to be better then gold, then much fine gold of Ophir. So excellent myſteries are therein contained, as neuer entred in mans heart; yea, the Angels deſire to looke into them: 1. Pet. 1.12. Such myſteries as concernes not our worldly wealth, but the ſaluation of our ſoul

                           •
                        d of Truth both for the Author, for the matter, and for the effect; giuing vs aſſurance, that it is the truth. Wouldeſt thou

haue deepeneſſe and profound knowledge? Wheres greater profoundneſſe then in the Scripture? Wouldeſt thou bee an Antiquary? Here is a ſtory from the beginning of the World. Delighteſt thou in the Law? Here is the ground of all lawes, whence they ſpring &amp; iſſue. Delightſt thou in Hiſtories? Heere are all ſorts admirable for pleaſure and profit. Or in Chronologie? No where is the like for truth, or for length of continuance, euen for 4000. yeares in ſeueral perſons, lineally deſcended from Adam to Chriſt.
                     
                     Now the Word (ſaith S. Paul to Timothy, 2. Tim. 3.16.) is profitable firſt, to teach; ſecondly, to conuince; thirdly, to correct, and to inſtruct. According to theſe properties, let vs make ſeuerall vſes.
                     
                        
                           Ʋſe. 1. This then teacheth vs; firſt, that therefore we ought to know the ground of thoſe things that we beleeue: we muſt ſearch the Scriptures.
                     2. That it is neceſſary that the Scriptures be tranſlated, that all may ſearch.
                     3. That the Scriptures are plaine, or may be vnderſtood by thoſe that will ſearch: elſe why ſhould we ſearch?
                     4. That the Scriptures are a ſufficient rule and direction; and therfore Chriſt bids them ſearch in the Scriptures and no where elſe.
                     2. This refutes the errors of the Papiſt, who haue many poſitions cleane contrary vnto this Doctrine: as,
                     1. That people are to be kept in Ignorance.
                     2. That the Scriptures muſt bee read in an vnknowne tongue.
                     3. That Traditions, Fathers, and Councels, muſt bee ioyned with the Scriptures.
                     3. For Correction. It ſerues to reproue diuers ſorts of men. Some care not to reade the Scriptures, but of all bookes make leſt account of it: Chronicles, Hiſtories, Playbookes are often read; the Scriptures ſeldome. Some will not ſuffer a Bible to be in their houſes, and count it a reproach to carry a Bible to Church. Some will reade at Church, and turne to places as they are quoted, but neuer at home, their buſineſſe ſuffers them

not: who yet are better then many, that will bring other bookes to Church, and while the Miniſter is preaching, reade thoſe. Some content themſelues to haue read ouer a number of Chapters at a time, without any further ſearch. Some read and labour to ſearch out the true meaning of places, but all is, that they may know the occurrences of things, bee able to reconcile places, and maintaine them againſt the Aduerſarie, who yet faile in this duty, in that they are not caſt into the mould of the Scripture, and by their ſearch doe not finde out the hidden Pearle, Chriſt Ieſus.
                     4. For Inſtruction: it ſhewes, that this is a duty belonging to all to performe, and for our Direction in ſearching of the Scriptures, it is neceſſarie.
                     1. That we haue the Scriptures in our houſes, in our cloſets; that wee reade them diligently and frequently, with ſtudy and obſeruation; that we attend to reading, hauing thereunto appointed times at riſing, at going to bed, that beſides publike reading in the Familie, we vſe priuate reading by our ſelues. Not to tie our ſelues to reade ouer three chapters a day, ſo to reade the whole Bible in a yeere; but that we mark what bookes are eaſie, what more difficult, what beſt retained in memory, what more hardly; and according to make choice of places, and to reade thoſe that are moſt needefull and profitable for vs: and ſuch bookes as are hardeſt, as the Epiſtles of Paul and the Poeticall bookes, Iob, Pſalmes, &amp;c. to read them often.
                     2. That we doe not reade, without calling vpon the Name of God for direction, to open our eies that we may vnderſtand his will.
                     3. That wee reade with a minde to ſubiect our ſeluess to it.
                     4. That in reading, we gather no collections contrary to the Analogy of faith contained in the Creed, Commandements and Lords Prayer.
                     5. That in thoſe things wee vnderſtand not, wee ſeeke for ſuch helpe of others as we may for the finding ou
                           •
                         of the truth, &amp;c.
                     
                        The reaſons brought to cōfirme this precept are two; the firſt is taken from that opinion which they had of the Scripture to whom Chriſt directs this exhortation. [For in them ye thinke, &amp;c.] Herein conſider, firſt, The Subſtance of the reaſon. Which is, that the Iewes thought in the Scripture to haue eternall life. Which is not layd downe as a falſe opinion but as a true and orthodoxall ground, the more alſo to checke them, who although they had ſo good an opi
                           •
                        ion of the Scriptures yet did not ſearch them.
                     
                        Doct. The Scriptures were written for our ſaluation that we might haue eternall life. Ioh. laſt. and laſt verſ. For they firſt, declare in generall the good will of God to ſaue man, ſecondly, they ſhew the mean
                           •
                        s whereby wee are ſaued. Thirdly, they wo

                        by we come to be partakers of this meanes.

                        Doct. Chriſt, Ieſus is the maine and chiefe Treaſure contained in them. Runne we through the whole Scripture, we ſhall finde this true, how it alwayes points at him: Luk. 1.70. Luk. 24.27. Act. 10.43.
                     For Chriſt is the onely Author and meanes, whereby we attaine vnto life; therefore the Scripture muſt needs giue it vnto Chriſt, elſe how could life be had in the Scriptures.
                     
                        Vſe, it ſhewes whither we muſt goe to find Chriſt, not to the writing of men, but to the Scriptures.
                     Further, from the time wherein Chriſt did vtter this, viz. before any part of the new Teſtament was written, and therefore hee muſt needs meane the old: we may note, that
                     
                        Doct. Chriſt made knowne to the ancient Fathers before his incarnation. Which may ſerue to refute the opinions of thoſe, that thinke the ancient Iewes were moued on
                           •
                        ly with temporall promiſes and iudgement, and not with ſpirituall. But it was Abrahams Faith in Chriſt, not his hope of the Land of Canaan, that was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe. How can Moſes be ſaid to haue ſuffered the rebuke of Chriſt, Heb. 11.26. if he had not beleeued in him.

                           But yee will not come to me that yee might haue life.
                        
                     
                     NOw followes the reproofe of theſe Iewes. which is in generall for their incredulity, in that they did not beleeue in him, whom the Scriptures declared. This their incredulity is generally laid downe, verſ. 38. aggrauated, firſt, by the cauſes thereof: firſt, ignorance, verſ. 37.38. Secondly, wilfulnes in this verſe. Thirdly, want of loue, verſ. 42. Fourthly, ambition, v 44.
                     Secondly, by the Iſſue, viz. condemnation, verſ 45. &amp;c.
                     In this verſe we haue to note, firſt a declaration of the ſinne it ſelfe, namely, obſtinacy [yee will not come to me.]
                     Secondly, an aggrauation of it, by the miſchiefe following vpon it, namely loſſe of life [that yee might haue life.]
                     Note here firſt the inference of this vpon the former. Wee haue heard that they thought well of the Scriptures, and looked

in them to haue eternall life, yet we ſee they come not v
                           •
                        
                        to Chriſt, in and by whom they might haue life. What is the reaſon of this? Surely their opinion was on a falſe ground, they looked for life by other meanes, then by Chriſt, as by their owne righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. Hence note,
                     
                        Doct. They that are perſwaded to attaine life by falſe meanes, will neuer be brought to ſeeke after the right meanes. Thus the Iewes, Eſay 30. and 31. truſting to Egypt, withdrew themſelues from the Lord, the onely meanes of their ſafety. Thus did the Scribes and Phariſes, Luk. 7.30. deſpiſe the councell of God, whereas Publicans, Souldiers, Harlots, &amp;c. came vnto Chriſt. Why? Becauſe theſe had no other ground to truſt vnto, whereby they might attaine to life. But the Phariſes were full of many falſe perſwaſions of attaining to it by other meanes: Mat. 21.30. Luk. 1.33.
                     
                        Vſe is to teach vs to take heed that our ſoules be not poſſeſſed with falſe perſwaſions.
                     The obſtinacy and wilfulneſſe of the Iewes appeares herein, that neither by the preaching of Iohn, nor by the witneſſe of God the Father giuen to Chriſt at his Baptiſme, nor yet by the teſtimony of the Scripture, they would be mooued to beleeue in Chriſt.
                     
                        Doct. They that haue the Word preached, and yet beleeue not in Chriſt, are guilty of the ſinne of obſtinacy. They are ſcorners, Prou. 1.22. Reade Ezek. 2. and 3. Matth. 23.37. Act. 2

                     For if a man haue eyes, and yet ſee not the Sunne when it ſhineth, ſhall we not thinke that he winketh of purpoſe.
                     
                        Obiect. But the caſe is not ſo in ſpirituall things; Faith is not in our power; wee haue not theſe ſpirituall eyes to behold Chriſt of our owne. How then can it bee obſtinacy, if we doe not beleeue.
                     
                        Anſw. 1. I anſwer, that there is no man that liues where the Goſpell is preached, and yet beleeues not, but he doth faile in doing of ſome things that hee might doe. So that though ſauing Faith be not in his power, yet doth he wilfully neglect to doe many things which are in his power, whereby he might

attaine vnto Faith: as neglect of comming to the Church, of attention to the Word, of Prayer, &amp;c.
                     2. Howſoeuer we haue not free will to beleeue, yet can we reſiſt, and gaineſay the truth, and diſtruſt God from a freeneſſe of will, ariſing from the peruerſeneſſe of our corrupt nature.
                     So that both for wilfull neglect, and alſo repugnancy, and reſiſting of the Word, ſhall ſuch be condemned as obſtinate.
                     
                        Vſe To condemne thoſe that liue vnder the Goſpell, and yet are not wrought vpon by the Goſpell, whoſe caſe is worſe then that of Sauages and Infidels.
                     From the aggrauation of this fault we may learne, that
                     
                        Doct. 1. They that are obſtinately ſet againſt Chriſt and 
                           •
                        is Goſpell, by no promiſe, no reward can be moued to relent and yeeld vnto Chriſt, no, not for life it ſelfe. Such obſtinacy was in Lots ſonnes in law, Gen. 19.15. in the Egyptians, Exod. 9.21. Pſal. 58.4, 5. Act. 13.45.
                     For obſtinacy doth ſo fill, and poſſeſſe the heart, that neither threats, nor promiſes can take any place.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 41.
                           I receiue not the praiſe of men.
                        
                     
                     THis verſe is inſerted in policy to preuent an obiection that the Iewes might make. For whereas he had reproued them for not comming vnto him, they might thinke thereupon, and ſay; O ſurely this man would haue many followers, he would that men ſhould praiſe and applaud him. Wherefore Chriſt tels them, that he ſeekes not, he hunts not after the praiſe of men; it is their ſaluation that he aimes at.
                     
                        Doct. Chriſt in thoſe things that he did, did not ſeeke for his owne honour, reputation and glory, but to bring ſaluation vnto others: and ſo many times when he had done a great work, he withdrew himſelfe, to take away all occaſion that people ſhould not talke of him; yea, hee forbad them to ſpeake of him.
                     For firſt, he needed not this popular applauſe and commendation, being the Sonne of God. Secondly, his works did commend

themſelues. Thirdly, yea, praiſe followed him, where he fled from it. Fourthly, Chriſt did now abaſe himſelfe, and would now ſhew himſelfe a patterne of humility for our imitation; and therefore he did not ſeeke to extoll himſelfe, Ioh. 13.15. Mat. 20.27, 28.
                     
                        Vſe. To ſet Chriſt before vs, and to follow him; looking to our duty to doe, becauſe God hath laid it vpon vs, not becauſe of applauſe and commendation. And this, as it is to bee done of all, ſo eſpecially of Miniſters that ſtand in Chriſts ſtead, who looke that they draw people vnto them for their good, and not for their owne praiſe: and ſo to preach, as not to preach themſelues, but for the edification of the people.

                     In this verſe is expreſſed the ſecond fault, for which hee reprooueth them, viz. their want of loue; which is the ſecond cauſe of their incredulity. Here note, firſt, the ground of his reproofe. Secondly, the thing reprooued.
                     1. The ground, [I know you.] Whatſoeuer you pretend, I know that it is not for Gods honour and glory that you doe this &amp;c.
                     
                        Doct. Chriſt knoweth mans heart and diſpoſition, bee hee good, Ioh. 1.47. or bad, Ioh. 2.25.
                     
                        Vſe, for terror, for Hypocrites and diſſemblers.
                     2. For incouragement to thoſe that are vpright and true-hearted.

                        Vſe, For our imitation to goe vpon ſure grounds, not vpon euill ſurmiſes and ſuſpitions?
                     2. The fault for which they are reprooued, is want of the loue of God. A ſtrange thing, if we conſider what great ſhewes

theſe Iewes made of the loue of God.
                     
                        Doct. Many who ſeeme to ſtand for Gods glory, and fo

                         his ordinances, and make great pretences of zeale to him; yet if their hearts be knowne, they will be found not to haue one true ſparke of loue in them; as in Corah and his company: Numb. 16. in all Heretikes, Papiſts and Idolaters. It is not for loue, but for by-reſpects, ſome through enuy, ſome through ambition, ſome through couetouſneſſe, &amp;c.
                     Wherefore we are to examine our ſelues, with what minde we doe thoſe things which we doe, whether out of a pure loue of God, or no. This we ſhall know, by conſidering the nature and properties of this loue.
                     1. Loue of God is a holy ſpirituall affection, whereby our hearts are ſo k
                           •
                        it vnto him, that we do make him our ſummum bonum, chiefeſt good, whereon we doe reſt. And it manifeſts it ſelfe by theſe two properties: firſt, a care to pleaſe him, and to continue in his fauour; that is, when we delight in his Word, and obey his will and commandements. For in his Word is declared what things are pleaſing vnto him. That this is a property of this true loue appeares, Ioh. 14.23, 24. 1. Ioh. 2.5. 2. Ioh. verſ. 6. Whence followes another branch of this, namely, a feare to offend him, when wee are carefull to auoide all things that doe diſpleaſe him: Pſal. 97.10.
                     2. By a loue of what and whom hee loueth: when for his ſake we loue man, whom God hath made the chiefeſt obiect of his loue: Ioh. 3.16. And as man in generall, ſo eſpecially thoſe on whom God hath placed his ſpeciall loue, in regenerating, and begetting them againe to himſelfe: 1. Ioh. 5.1. Pſal. 16.3.
                     
                        
                           •
                        y theſe properties we are to examine our ſelues: and hereby it appeareth, that the Iewes had not the loue of God in them; for they delighted not in his Word, Ioh. 8.47. They kept not his Commandements, Matth. 15.8, 9. Neither loue
                           •
                         they thoſe whom God loued; for Chriſt they hated, although they knew by the teſtimony of Iohn Baptiſt, and the witneſſe of God himſelfe, that he was the beloued of God: ſo did they likewiſe the Prophets, Apoſtles, and holy men: 1. Theſ. 2.15.

                           I am come in my Fathers Name, and yee receiue me not; if another ſhall come in his owne Name, him will yee receiue.
                        
                     
                     IN theſe words Chriſt laies downe a confirmation of the former point, namely, that theſe Iewes had no loue of God in them; his proofe is drawne from their affection and diſpoſition towards himſelfe, that came in the Name of God, and towards others that came not in the Name of God. Now that the ſtrength of this proofe may appeare, obſerue the meaning of the words.
                     
                        I am come] This is ſpoken of that voluntary ſubiection whereunto Chriſt did abaſe himſelfe, to become our Mediator, our Prieſt, and our Prophet, to reueale his Fathers will vnto vs.
                     
                        In my Fathers Name] This implies three things: firſt, that he came with authority and commiſſion from his Father. Secondly, that he came to bring a Meſſage from his Father, to declare his will. Thirdly, that he came to ſet forth, not his owne, but his Fathers honour and glory.
                     
                        Yee receiue me not,] Yee reiect my doctrine, and hate my perſon.
                     
                        If another come in his owne name,] Of his owne head, declaring his owne conceites, or doctrines receiued from other men, ſeeking his owne praiſe and honour.
                     
                        Him yee receiue.] Such yee honour, loue, follow, and emb

                        .
                     The Argument then is thus: They that loue God, loue thoſe that come in Gods Name, and reiect the other that come in their owne name:
                     But yet doe cleane contrary:
                     Therefore yee haue not the loue of God in you.
                     Obſerue here then, firſt, a deſcription of thoſe who are the obiect, whereby our loue to God may be diſcerned, namely, of Miniſters, who are either ſent of God, or come in their owne names; that is, are either faithfull Miniſters, whereof Chriſt

doth here ſet forth himſelfe as a patterne.
                     [I am come, &amp;c.] (But of this diuers times before) or falſe teachers and vnfaithfull, here ſet downe by the example of the Phariſes, of whom it is plaine, that they were not ſent of God, who preached their owne Traditions, and ſought onely their owne glory. Hence we learne,
                     
                        Doct. That it is a certaine note of a true Miniſter, to come in Gods Name, and of a falſe Miniſter to come in his owne name: the one hath an eye vnto God, and runnes not before he be ſent; and being ſent, obſerues what his will is, and according to it, doth all things for his glory: the other hath an eye onely to man, to pleaſe him, to ſeeke honour and preferment, &amp;c. This difference wee ſee plainely betweene Michah the Prophet of the Lord, and Chenaanah, and the reſt of the falſe Prophets: 1. King. 22.11, 12, 14. betweene Ieremiah: Ier. 42. who perſwaded the people to obey the King of Babel: and Hananiah: Ier. 28.10, 11.
                     See Ier. 23.16, 17.
                     
                        Vſe. This is a ſpeciall meanes to try the ſpirits, 1. Ioh. 4.1. whether they be of God, or no, if they ſeeke themſelues, or the Lord.
                     2. It ſhewes that many among vs, although they haue an outward Calling, yet comes not in Gods Name, in that they aime not at the edifying of the Church by preaching, but their owne maintenance, eaſe and honour; or if they preach, they preach themſelues to ſhew learning, not for inſtruction of the people.
                     Secondly, obſerue in this verſe the peoples carriage and affection towards the Miniſters, either receiuing, or reiecting of them.
                     
                        Doct. 1. They that receiue not ſuch as come in the Name of God, it is plaine they haue no loue of God in them: for they that loue not him that is ſent, loue not him that ſendeth: 1. Ioh. 5.1. Iob. 13.20. This appeareth by the different carriage of godly men, and of hypocrites from time to time towards the faithfull Miniſters; as of Abab and good Iehoſhaphat towards Micah: 1. King. 22.8. of the good Princes, and the hypocriticall

call Prieſts againſt Ieremiah: Ier. 26.11, 16.
                     Note this, that we may examine our ſelues, with what mind wee haue entertained thoſe faithfull Miniſters, that God hath g
                           •
                        uen vnto vs in this land, &amp;c.
                     
                        Doct. 2. They who receiue ſuch as come in their owne name, loue not God: for there is a maine oppoſition betweene this, the ſeeking of mans ſelfe his honour and eaſe, and the ſeeking of the Lord: Phil. 2.21. and therefore they that delight in ſuch as ſeeke not the Lord, aſſuredly loue not God. For it is a property of true loue, to loue thoſe whom God loueth, and hate thoſe whom he reiecteth: Reuel. 26. Pſal. 139.21, 22.
                     
                        Doct. 3. From the ioyning of theſe together, learne. That thoſe who reiect true and faithfull Miniſters of the Lord, are ready to embrace falſe teachers. Pharaoh hated Moſes, but receiued Iannes and Iambres. Ahab hated Michaiah, but liked the falſe prophets. So the Iewes did flocke after Theudas and Iudas of Galilee, Act. 5.36, 37. yet they reiected Chriſt and his Apoſtles. The like they did in the laſt deſtruction of Ieruſalem, as Ioſephus reports; and now doe they highly eſteeme their Rabbins. Which commeth to paſſe, firſt, through the iuſt iudgement of God, who giueth them vp to the blindneſſe of their heart to beleeue ſtrong deluſions: 2. Theſ. 2.10, 11. Deuter. 28. Secondly, through the corruption of nature, becauſe we are naturally diſpoſed vnto error, rather then vnto truth, into which alſo wee eaſily doe fall, if wee bee not reſtrained by the Spirit of God. Whence it is, that there neuer was any heretike, were his opinions neuer ſo groſſe and damnable, but had many followers: 2. Pet. 2.1.2.
                     
                        Vſe. This teacheth vs not to cloſe our eyes againſt the truth, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 44.
                           How can yee beleeue which receiue honour one of another, and ſeeke not the honour that commeth of God alone?
                        
                     
                     IN theſe words is laid downe a fourth fault of theſe obſtinate Iewes, which is alſo another cauſe of their incredulitie. A

                         beleeuing, but ſuch a cauſe as implies an impoſſibility, that it was impoſſible for them to beleeue. And therefore he ſetteth it downe very emphatically by way of interrogation [How can yee?]
                     
                        Queſt. But how may it be imputed vnto them?
                     
                        Anſw. Firſt, generally, in regard of Nature, it is impoſſible for any man to beleeue, becauſe firſt, by nature we reliſh not ſpirituall things, we ſee no fruit, or benefit by them, and ſo we regard them not. Secondly, by nature wee are not capable of them: 1. Cor. 2.14.
                     2. But in ſpeciall, whereas Chriſt ſaith, How can yee beleeue; hee makes this their ambition to be a peculiar let and hinderance to them. For whereas the doores of our hearts is naturally ſhut vp againſt ſauing faith, ambition is as a barre that keepes it faſt from opening.
                     The firſt thing then to be noted in theſe words, is the cauſe of th
                           •
                        ir vnbeliefe, viz. their ambition and deſire of honour.
                     
                        Doct. Ambition is a maine impediment to ſauing faith; Ioh. 12.43. and therefore their Faith mentioned, verſ. 42. was only hiſtoricall; Ioh. 7.5. Chriſts kinsfolkes beleeued not in him, being loth to be ill thought of among the Phariſes.
                     For there is a direct oppoſition betweene Faith and ambition. Faith makes a man to be vile in his owne eyes, to ſee his owne wants, and ſo cauſeth him to goe out of himſelfe, and ſeeke for helpe at God onely.
                     But ambition makes a man to thinke highly of himſelfe, to ouerweene himſelfe, and be much conceited of his owne gifts, as the proud Phariſes. So that he will attribute all to himſelfe, and nothing to God, as did Herod, Act. 12.22, 23.
                     
                        Vſe, To take heed of this roote of bitterneſſe; to ſtriue againſt ambition and vaine-glory, and for motiues to conſider,
                     1. The doctrine before deliuered.
                     2. That ambition and deſire of praiſe corrupts, putrifies and maketh odious to God, euery good thing that we take in hand, our prayers, faſtings, almeſdeeds, the very worſhip and ſeruice of God: Eſay.
                     
                     
                        3. That in ſeeking praiſe of men, we looſe the praiſe of God, who haue here our reward.
                     4. Gal. 1.10.
                     5. That hereby wee prouoke Gods wrath againſt vs: for he reſiſteth the proud; as did Herod, Act. 12.23.
                     
                        Queſt. But is it ſimply vnlawfull to ſeeke the praiſe of men?
                     
                        Anſw. We may not ſimply ſeeke it, to the end to be prayſed of them: for men praiſe thoſe things that are agreeable to their humour, and all doe not like godlineſſe: but when it may tend to the honour of God, the confirmation of the good, and the rebuke of thoſe that oppoſe themſelues, we may ſeeke it. As Paul would haue the Corinthians to thinke well of him, but it was for Chriſt for the profeſſions ſake, and that the aduerſaries mouth might be ſtopped.
                     2. We may not ſeeke for it in the firſt place, but in his due order, firſt ſeeking to be approued of God, then the approbation of men. Firſt, doing thoſe things, which in the vprightneſſe and integrity of our conſcience wee know to bee good, then if men doe like and allow of it, to receiue this as a bleſſing of God, if not to be contented, and not to hunt after their applauſe. And thus we are to labour to leaue a bleſſed name and memory behind vs.
                     Directions to auoide ambition:
                     1. In all things that wee thinke to be excellent and praiſe-worthy, conſider whence we haue them; 1. Cor. 4.7.
                     2. To conſider what a Sea of impiety and wickedneſſe is in vs, how many faults our hearts are priuy vnto; for this conſideration will pull downe all proud conceits.
                     3. To conſider that of the Apoſtle, 2. Cor. 10. laſt verſe, that ſo we be not puffed vp with any thing that may ſeeme glorious to man, but may ſtudy to approue our ſelues vnto God in what he allowes.
                     Further, note here the deſcription of an ambitious humour, in theſe words (one of another) noting, that they did ſooth, flatter, and claw one another.
                     
                        Doct. Ambitious men are ready to puffe vp, and to flatter

one another· They will giue titles to others, that ſuch titles might be giuen vnto themſelues. They doe it not that others might be praiſed; for pride 
                           •
                        uer goes with enuy, and hatred of pride in others. But this is the way to get honour from others, by ſeeming to honour them.
                     
                        Vſe. To take to our hearts in giuing of honour to other, it is not a thing vnlawfull, 1. Pet. 2.17. Rom. 12.10. ſo it bee not done for vndue and vniuſt reſpects, Iob 31. laſt verſe.
                     How inconuenient this ambition is, appeares by the conſequent [And ſeeke not the honour, &amp;c.] Whence obſerue, firſt, from the inference:
                     
                        Doct. They which ſeeke for popular applauſe and praiſe of men, are careleſſe in ſeeking for the praiſe of God, as did the Phariſes, whoſe whole practiſe was to bee ſeene of men, not to approue themſelues to God: and ſo Chriſt compares them to whited tombes.
                     For there is a contrariety be
                           •
                        weene Gods will and mans will, and what pleaſeth man pleaſeth not him: and ſo if we ſet our ſelues to ſeeke the one, we cannot ſeeke the other.
                     
                        
                           Ʋſe. This is a further motiue to auoide ambition.
                     
                        Doct. 2. In that this is laid downe as a reproofe of them, that they did not ſeeke the praiſe of God, note, That true praiſe commeth from God: that praiſe which we may, and ought to ſeeke, and wherein we may reſt, that is, that praiſe which is giuen of God for thoſe things which hee allowes, who knowes beſt what is good and praiſe-worthy.
                     
                        Obiect. But may wee not doe thoſe things that are praiſed by the Saints?
                     
                        Anſw. Yea: for they doe it being directed by the Word, and illightned by the Spirit, ſo that their praiſe is the very praiſe of God. But it muſt not bee vnderſtood here of that commendations which is giuen by naturall men.
                     
                        Doct. 3. From hence we may alſo learne, that it is lawfull to ſeeke for praiſe; becauſe it is a reward of piety and vertue: ſo that not the thing, but the manner of ſeeking it is condemned.
                     Now in this caſe we muſt doe as men vſe to doe, that ſeeke the praiſe of another, they will obſerue to doe euery thing that

may be pleaſing vnto him, &amp;c. ſo if wee will ſeeke the honour of God, we muſt marke diligently what is his will, what is acceptable to him, and in thoſe things we ſeeke to honor him by obeying his will, and then ſhall we be aſſured to receiue honour from him againe, 1. Sam. 2.30.
                     
                        Doct. 4. Alone] This implies, that we may not ſeeke praiſe of God and of men both together; labouring to approue our ſelues in ſome things to God, and in ſome things to man: for the iudgement of God and man are contrary, and we cannot ſatisfie both. And therefore wee muſt ſet our ſelues to reiect the one, and to ſeeke wholly the other.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 45.
                           Doe not thinke that I will accuſe you to my Father: there is one that accuſeth you, euen Moſes in whom yee truſt.
                        
                     
                     AFter that our Sauiour had reprooued theſe Iewes for their vnbeliefe, and laid downe the cauſes thereof, viz. their ignorance, obſtinacy, want of loue, and ambition, hee comes in the next place to the euent and iſſue, that will follow vpon this their incredulity; telling them (in theſe words) that condemnation remaines for them, they ſhall be accuſed, and ſo as that they ſhall be condemned. It is then a very ſeuere Commination againſt them, wherein obſerue; firſt, who ſhall accuſe them; firſt, negatiuely, one is remooued [Think not that I.] Secondly, affirmatiuely, another is declared who it ſhall be, viz. Moſes.
                     
                     Secondly, for what they ſhall be accuſed. Firſt, in generall, from the manner of Chriſts proceeding, how that after hee had firſt ſoundly prooued the point in queſtion, viz. that hee was God, and alſo reproued them for their incredulity; now ſeeing them ſtill to remaine obſtinate, and that nothing would worke vpon them, hee can no longer forbeare, but hee threatens this 
                           •
                        eauy iudgement vpon them. Hence we learne,
                     
                        Doct. That when men will not be moued with ſoundneſſe of argument, or with reproofes, they muſt bee more roundly dealt withall, by denouncing the iudgements of God againſt

them. This was the practiſe of Chriſt againſt all obſtinate men, as the Phariſes, Mat. 23. Many woes denounced. Of Moſes with Corah and his company. Of Iohn Baptiſt with the ſame Phariſes, Mat. 3.7. Tit. 1.13. For when milder meane
                           •
                         will not preuaile this may worke vpon them, Iud. verſ. 23. Therefore as lenity and mildeneſſe doth become the ſeruant of God, ſo doth alſo ſeuerity beſeeme him according as hee hath perſons to deale withall. Theſe cautions obſerued, firſt, that he haue a calling to doe it: for then doth the threatnings terrifie: as if a child be threatned by his father, a ſubiect by hi
                           •
                         Prince. Secondly, that the perſon be certainely found to bee obſtinate. Thirdly, that it be done without paſſion, in a holy zeale with meekeneſſe. Fourthly, that it be done without reſpect of perſons to one, as well as another, ſparing none. Fiftly, that it be for weighty cauſes, not for trifles, as Excommunication is now vſed, which makes it ſo lightly eſteemed of. Sixtly, it muſt be vſed in the laſt place, after all other gentler meanes ſought·
                     In particular, firſt, conſider the occaſion of theſe words [Doe not thinke] implying that this obſtinacy aroſe in them, becauſe they cared not for Chriſt, nor eſtemed what he ſaid, whom they accounted but as a meane man like vnto others; yea, worſe then others, holding him for a blaſphemer, prophaner of the Sabbath, &amp;c. but as for them, they had Moſes for their Patron, whom they truſted in. This their thought being not yet vttered, Chriſt preuenteth, telling them, that euen Moſes, whom they ſo highly magnified, ſhould be their accuſer.
                     Of this dealing of Chriſt, we haue many examples, how hee doth preuent the thoughts of his hearers, ſo meeting with ſinne at the beginning, before it breake out further.

This may be taken two wayes, either litterally, and that, firſt, in regard of that proper and maine end, for which Chriſt came into the world, viz. not to condemne and accuſe ſinners: for this the Law had done before, but to ſaue. Secondly, in regard of his high Office, to be a Iudge to heare and giue ſentence, and not to be an Accuſer.

Or figuratiuely; firſt, by way of conceſſion; as if hee ſhould ſay, Though I ſhould hold my peace, and ſay nothing of you to my Father, yet ſhould you not be acquited: for euen Moſes, whom you hold for your Patron, ſhall accuſe you. Secondly, by way of amplification, as if he had ſaid, Thinke not that I alone will accuſe you, there is another alſo that will accuſe you, euen Moſes.
                     
                     From the connection of theſe two, obſerue,
                     
                        Doct. They that beleeue not Moſes and his writings, ſhall haue Moſes to be their accuſer. So they that beleeue not the Prophets, haue the Prophets for their accuſers. The ſame may be applied to the Apoſtles, and all faithfull Miniſters of the Word: for they all bring not their owne, but the meſſage of God, whoſe Word cannot goe backe in vaine, but it either breeds faith, or makes moe obſtinate, it is either a ſauour of life, or of death, 1. Cor. 6.
                     
                        Vſe. It teacheth vs to be very carefull in reading of Moſes, the Prophets, Apoſtles, &amp;c. in hearing the Miniſters of the Word, to take heed how we reade and heare, viz. ſo that wee apply both threatnings and promiſes to our ſelues, that we beleeue all doctrine of Faith, follow after all graces whereunto we haue been ſtirred vp, auoide all vices, from which wee haue been dehorted.

                        In whom yee truſt.] Firſt, note here the erroneous and hereticall collection of the Papiſts from hence; therefore, ſay they, the ancient Fathers beleeued in Moſes, truſted in him, adored him, and called vpon him: wherefore ſo may we doe vnto the Saints.
                     The vanity of this appeares, firſt, becauſe theſe here ſpoken of, are ſuch as Chriſt condemnes, and who had Moſes to bee their accuſer. So that they truſted in Moſes, and Moſes would accuſe them for it; and what doth this make for the Papiſts? Secondly, by Moſes is meant here Moſes doctrine, and not his perſon; and ſo they are here ſaid to truſt in Moſes, as before they are ſaid to truſt in the Scriptures. Thus in Exodus, they beleeued the Lord and Moſes, 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         that is, they gaue credence to Moſes. So 2. Chron. 20.20. So it is in the Vulgar.
                     Secondly, from this obſerue, that whereas it is laid downe, to ſhew their high account and good opinion that they had of Moſes, who yet notwithſtanding, ſhould be their accuſer.
                     
                        Doct. The high account that people haue of Miniſters, ſhall not keepe them from being their accuſers, if they beleeue, and obey not their doctrine.
                     For it is onely faith and obedience to their doctrine that can free vs from the accuſation of our Miniſters: for ſo they ſhall not haue to accuſe vs, but to pleade for vs; Heb. 13.8, 17.

                     IN this verſe is laid downe the cauſe why Moſes would accuſe them, which is their incredulity: not directly expreſſed, but laid downe vnder a proofe, and

                         the more ſtrongly affirmed.
                     Now this is ſtrange that they ſhould not beleeue in Moſes, in whom, as is ſaid before, they truſted, whoſe diſciples they profeſſed themſelues to be, whom they knew to be inſtructed of God.

anſwer to the Rich man, Luk. 16.31.
                     For the Scriptures haue been approoued from time to time to be the Word of God, and the ground of all writing, ſpeaking and preaching, hauing fully declared the whole will of God.
                     
                        Vſe 1. That wee ſeeke not any other meanes to breed Faith beſides the Word.
                     Secondly, that this be a ſtrong motiue to ſtirre vp to haue it in high account.
                  
               
               
                  AN EXPOSITION VPON THE THIRD OF IOHN.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Ioh. 3.29, 30.
                           He that hath the Bride, is the Bridegroome: but the friend of the Bridegrome, which ſtandeth and heareth him, reioyceth greatly becauſe of the Bridegroomes voyce: This my ioy therefore is fulfilled.
                           He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.
                        
                     
                     
                        THeſe words are part of that teſtimony which Iohn gaue concerning Chriſt. It beginneth at the 27. verſe.
                     In it wee may obſerue theſe foure diſtinct points:
                     Firſt, the free confeſſion that Iohn maketh of his owne profeſſion and gifts: verſ. 27, 28. In th
                           ••
                         
                        
                           •
                        bſerue,
                     1. Whe
                           •
                        ce his Gifts and Callings was, viz. from Heauen. This affoords many inſtructions: firſt, that man hath nothing, nor ability, &amp;c. of himſelfe, but from aboue: which ſerueth to humble vs, Rom. 14. Secondly, that euery excellent thing commeth from Heauen, whether ſpirituall or temporall, Iam. 1.17.

This ſheweth whether to haue recourſe for a ſupply of our wants, and to whom to giue thankes when we haue receiued any bleſſings. Thirdly, that God, as he beſtoweth all things on men, ſo he proportioneth them accordingly to euery man. This ſheweth, that wee are to obſerue our owne gifts and callings, and herewith to be contented.
                     2. What his Calling was, the declaration is partly negatiue, [I am not Chriſt:] Affirmatiue; [but I am ſent before him.] This ſheweth the integrity of Iohn, that Iohn would ſo abaſe himſelfe, and acknowledge his place, not onely before ſtrangers, but alſo his friends, euen ſuch as would haue attributed greater matters vnto him.
                     
                        That I haue ſaid] viz. ſeuen times recorded by the Euangeliſts. This ſheweth vs, that we muſt be conſtant in our integritie. Againe, in that theſe witneſſes ſo often did talke of the preheminence of Iohn aboue Chriſt, and would not after ſo many ſayings of Iohn be perſwaded, we ſee how dangerous a thing it is to haue a wrong conceit fixed in our minde: wherefore we ought to labour to preuent and redreſſe ſpeedily all errors in iudgement.
                     
                        I am not the Chriſt.] Why? becauſe his diſciples would haue made him the Chriſt. This learnes vs not to take to vs any Honour or Calling that belongs not vnto vs, as titles, and the like.
                     
                        But I am ſent before him] that is, I am the ſeruant of Chriſt. This teacheth vs, that in no hand we be aſhamed of that Calling whereunto God hath called vs, howſoeuer it may ſeeme baſe in the world.
                     The ſecond point is the compariſon betweene himſelfe and Chriſt, and thereby ſheweth how much more excellent Chriſt is then himſelfe, is twofold: firſt, in the 29. verſe: ſecondly, in the 30. verſe.
                     Firſt, let vs ſee the literall meaning.
                     
                        Bride. Bridegroome.] Theſe termes are vſed for new married perſons, and in the originall not onely ſo, but for thoſe that are onely contracted. And this rather is meant here, becauſe the time of ſolemnization of the marriage betweene Chriſt and

the Church is not to be holden till the end of the World, in the Kingdome of Heauen.
                     
                        The friend] That is, ſuch a one as the Bridegroome deputeth in his ſtead to wooe the Bride, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , to bring her home, to prouide for the marriage, &amp;c.
                     
                        Standeth and heareth him, and reioyceth becauſe of the Bridegroomes voyce.] Hee reioyceth for the good end of his ſeruice, and that the Bridegroome doth in perſon performe that, which he did for him.
                     2. The Allegory. The Bride is the Church; the Bridegroome is Chriſt; the Friend of the Bridegroome is here meant particularly Iohn, who was ſent to prepare the Bride for Chriſt: for this was the end of his Calling. Now hee hearing that Chriſt is come, and himſelfe ſpeaketh to his Bride, and that the people hearken vnto him, now doth he reioyce, &amp;c.
                     Now the application is excellent and very fit, to conuince that enuious and ambitious conceit which poſſeſſed the diſciples minds, concerning the greatneſſe of Iohn aboue Chriſt. I am not (ſaith Iohn) the Bridegroome, but the Friend ſent to prepare, and fit the Bride for him: now how great a ſinne and offence were it for vs, if being ſent to woe for the Bridegroome, I ſhould ſpeake for my ſelfe, if I ſhould take the honour due to him, vpon my ſelfe, and ſo cauſe the Bride to commit idolatry, and ſpirituall fornication with another man.
                     Now come we to the inſtructions ariſing from the maine ſcope of theſe verſes, which is to ſhew the great difference that is betweene the Miniſters and Chriſt. Wee may obſerue, firſt, the Compariſon: ſecondly, the Inference.
                     The Compariſon ſheweth, firſt, the place of Chriſt, and the place of the Church. The point is; Chriſt is the onely Bridegroome and Husband of the Church, and the Church is the Spouſe and Bride onely of Chriſt. Whence it is, that ſuch titles of Head, Husband, Bridegroome, are giuen to Chriſt, onely in relation to the Church; of Wife, Loue, Spouſe, to the Church onely in relation to Chriſt: 1. Cor. 11.3. Eph. 5.25. Mat. 9.15. Epheſ. 5.23. and in the booke of the Canticles, Chap. 4.8. Eph. 5.23.
                     
                        Three eſpeciall reaſons there are why a man hath the prerogatiue to be a Bridegroome.
                     1. The gift and conſent of the Parents.
                     2. The loue and choice of the party, that is the Bridegroome.
                     3. The willing conſent and liking of the Bride.
                     1. Ioh. 17 6, 9, 11, 23, 25. The Church, is the gift of the Father.
                     2. Epheſ. 5.25. Act. 20.28. Hoſ. 2.19, 20. The loue and choice of Chriſt, Epheſ. 5.26.
                     3. Cant. 2.16. Epheſ. 5.24. The good liking and willing obe
                           •
                        ience of the Church.
                     This then is the prerogatiue that is due onely to Chriſt.
                     
                        Vſe. This commends vnto vs the great loue of Chriſt in vouchſafing this honour to the Church, to debaſe himſelfe ſo farre as to be her Bridegroome. Whereas indeed the beſt in the Church may ſay as Iohn, Mat. 3.11. I am not worthy to carry his ſhooes; and as Abigaile ſaid, when ſhe ſhould be Dauids wife. 1 Sam. 25.41.
                     When Heſter was taken to be Ahaſhueroſh his wife, though ſhe were a poore captiue, yet was there ſome cauſe why the King loued her, viz. becauſe ſhe pleaſed him, Eſter 2.9. but in the Church there is no cauſe why Chriſt ſhould caſt his loue on her, as appeares, Ezek. 16.6.
                     2. How carefull ought we to be in pleaſing of him, and by loue to anſwer this his loue, to carry our ſelues reuerently, to ſubiect our ſelues vnto his commandements, to ſeeke his honour, not to carry our ſelues rebelliouſly, preſumptuouſly, and proudly.
                     Againe, this is matter not onely of inſtruction, but of triall alſo, whether wee are of the Church, or no. This will appeare by our carriage: for if we be proud, contemptuous of our brethren, worldlings, couetous, &amp;c. it ſhewes, that the Spirit of Chriſt is not in vs, whereby wee a
                           •
                        e vnited vnto him, and one vnto another; if it were, then would the fruits thereof be in vs, as loue, meekeneſſe, &amp;c.
                     3. For Conſolation: firſt, that ſo Chriſt will performe the

duties of marriage; what are they? That he will protect and defend, and prouide for her: for he is both able, becauſe God; and willing, becauſe he was not conſtrained to take the Church for his Spouſe, Gen. 20.16. Secondly, ſo Chriſt is a companion with vs in all diſtreſſes, Act. 9. though he were in Heauen, yet by vertue of this vnion he was perſecuted: ſo Mat. 25. penult, Heb. 2.17. Thirdly, the Law of marriage requireth, that there be a communication of all the goods of the Husband with the Wife. Now Chriſt is rich, and full of grace, and ſo is the Church, Pſal. 45.13.
                     Though the Church ſtart aſide ſometime, yet doth not God caſt her away, Ier. 3.11. Ezek. 33.10, 11.
                     Yea, ſuch grace is giuen the Church, that ſhe ſhall neuer fall away finally, Rom. 11.29. Ioh. 10.28. Ioh. 13.1. So that this bond is indiſſoluble, and neuer to be broken, which is another conſolation we receiue from hence, that we are the Spouſe of Chriſt.
                     4. For refutation: So the title giuen to the Pope of Rome to be Head of the Church, is moſt diſhonourable and derogatory to Chriſt. Hee is not ſo the Friend of Chriſt, but plaine Antichriſt, arrogating that honour to him, which is due onely to Chriſt, 2. Cor. 11.2. our Husband. Iohns diſciples would faine haue made him Pope too, but he refuſed it.
                     2. The compariſon ſheweth the place, and duty of the Miniſters of Chriſt.
                     
                        Doct. Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus are friends of the Bridegroome, whom Chriſt vſeth to call home, the bride, as Ieremy was, cap. 3.1. and Hoſ. chap. 2.1. Matth. 9.15. children of the Marriage-chamber.
                     The reaſon why it pleaſeth Chriſt to haue theſe friends, is, firſt, for the honour of himſelfe; 
                           •
                        s it is the honour of a g
                           ••
                        at man, not to doe all by himſelfe. Secondly, for the good of th
                           •
                         Church; that the Church might more familiarly receiue the Word by the Miniſtery of man, which would be aſtoniſhed, 
                           〈◊〉
                         ſhe ſhould now heare Chriſt ſpeaking to her from Heauen in his Maieſty and glory. Thirdly, this is a meanes to trie the ſimple and pure obedience of the Church, that ſhee doth not ſo

much regard the meſſengers, as the meſſage, becauſe it is her husbands will, and ſo ſhe will obey it by whomſoeuer ſhe receiues the knowledge of it.
                     
                        
                           Ʋſe. This ſheweth the dignity and excellency of the Miniſters Calling.
                     2. To teach Miniſters to be carefull in the diſcharge of their duties, ſeeing their calling is ſo weighty.
                     Now let vs ſee what duties belong to the Miniſters, as they are the Friends of Chriſt. They are theſe:
                     1. To be Sutors to the Bride, 2. Cor. 5.20. to labour to win many wiues for Chriſt.
                     2. When people are wonne and conuerted, then to keepe them from ſtarting backe, and following ſtrange fleſh: for Miniſters are not onely planters, but alſo waterers, and Nurſes to bring vp, as well as fathers to beget children vnto God; and if they continue not to the end, theſe loſe the fruit and recompence of all their former labours.
                     3. If by the temptations they fall, then to labour to reclaime them, Luk. 15. Chriſt ſheweth his affection there by thoſe Parables of the loſt ſheepe, and Prodigall childe, as a patterne for all Miniſters to be ſo minded.
                     4. To haue a ſpeciall care to maintaine the honour due to Chriſt entire vnto him, not to part ſtakes with him, or to wooe for themſelues, as Iohn would not here, and the Apoſtles, Acts 
                        
                           •
                        .12, 16.
                     5. To be attentiue to the Bridegroome, to heare his will, and to teach it the Church; which duty is here, verſ. 29. expreſſed: and Ezek. 3.17. 1. Ioh. 1.1. Which ſerues to condemne ignorant Miniſters, and thoſe alſo that hearken to the voyce of other, or deliuer their owne conceits, and ſuch as the Papiſts, that talke of nothing but the voyce of the Church: Iohn ſaith here, heareth Him, not her, verſ. 29.
                     6. The laſt is alſo laid downe here, namely, to reioyce where people come vnto Chriſt, that ſo Chriſt may ſpeake vnto them, and they ſubmit themſelues to him. This ought to bee the fulnes of a Miniſters ioy when he ſeeth this fruit and power of his miniſtery in winning ſoules to Chriſt: 1. Th. 2.19. Act. 11.18, 23.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 30.
                           He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.
                           31. He that commeth from aboue, is aboue all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and ſpeaketh of the earth: hee that commeth from heauen is aboue all:
                           32. And what he hath ſeene and heard, that he teſtifieth, and no man receiueth his teſtimony.
                        
                     
                     IN the thirtieth verſe is noted the ſecond inference, inferred from the former compariſon; as if hee had ſaid, Now the Bridegroome himſelfe is come, mine office of preparing the Bride is finiſhed; therefore ſhall I decreaſe both in the miniſteriall function: for now the people will ſtocke vnto him, and leaue me, as alſo in that credit and preſent account which they carry of me, becauſe they ſhall now reuerence, admire, and honour Chriſt.
                     This then that here is ſpoken of Iohns decreaſing, is not meant as concerning the authority of Iohns Doctrine, or his faithfulneſſe in his Calling, which can neuer be diminiſhed, but as long as the World ſtands, Iohn wil be found to haue been moſt faithfull in his Office.
                     Now to ſhew that this came not by his owne negligence, or by Chriſts pride and ambition, but onely by the will of God, he puts a muſt to it [I muſt increaſe, &amp;c.]
                     From this humiliation of Iohn wee may learne diuers good leſſons, as
                     Firſt, this teacheth Miniſters that they ſhould not bee grieued, though they grow into diſgrace, and ſmall account amongſt men, if ſo be that thereby any glory may bee got vnto Chriſt.
                     Secondly, that the more men are eſteemed, the leſſe account is made of Chriſt; and contrariwiſe, the more account is made of Chriſt, the leſſe will man bee eſteemed; as is plaine by the example of the Corinthians, 1. Cor. 3.4. and by that holy iealouſie which the godly Miniſters haue had, when they perceiued much people to flocke about them.
                     The vſe is to teach vs, to fixe our eyes on Chriſt and God,

and not to dote on mans worthineſſe, and not ſo much to haue their perſons in admiration, as their Callings, and eſpecially that meſſage which they bring from God.
                     Thirdly, that where Chriſt ſhineth, leſſer lights are obſcured: as at the comming of Chriſt, and preaching of the Goſpell, the Types, Ceremonies, and darke ſhadowes of the Law were obſcured, 2. Pet. 1.19. for he is the Day-ſtar, and the true Sonne of righteouſneſſe.
                     1. This teacheth vs to be aſhamed of our ignorance in theſe dayes that the Goſpell ſhineth ſo bright vpon vs, and yet wee will not walke in the light thereof.
                     2. That is but a dotage and fooliſh conceit of ſome, who collect from hence, that Iohn was borne in that time of the yeere when the dayes decreaſe, and Chriſt when they increaſe, and thereupon alter their Almanacks, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 31.
                           He that commeth from aboue, is aboue all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and ſpeaketh of the earth: he that commeth from heauen is aboue all.
                        
                     
                     THis verſe containes a ſecond compariſon, to ſhew the excellency of Chriſt aboue man.
                     
                        He that is come from on high
                        
                           •
                         That is, he that is come from heauen, from God. And this is ſpoken in regard of the vnion of his two Natures: in regard of his diuine Nature, he is in heauen, yet not locally, as there included, for he filleth all things. In regard that he took vnto him the humane Nature, he is ſaid to come from Heauen.
                     
                        Is aboue a

                           l
                        
                           •
                         Angels and men.
                     
                        He that is of the earth] That is, a meere man.
                     
                        Is of the earth] That is, he ſauoureth of the earth, ſpeaketh of earth and carnall things. According to his condition, ſo is his diſpoſition, his condition earthly, his diſpoſition carnall, as the like, That which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh, Ioh. 3.6.
                     In this compariſon is ſhewed, firſt, what Chriſt is, firſt, in regard of his beginning and originall.
                     
                        Secondly, in regard of his excellency and preheminency.
                     2. What man is, firſt, in reſpect of this condition and making, [he that is of the earth.] Secondly, of his diſpoſition, inward [is of the earth,] and outward [ſpeaketh of the earth.]
                     Firſt, generall inſtruction that is drawne from the ſcope of the compariſon, is, That Man and Chriſt are as farre different, oppoſite and contrary as may be, as much as betweene heauen and earth: 1. Cor. 15.47. Ioh. 8.23.
                     This Iohn acknowledged, Matth. 3.11. Ioh. 1.27. and the Centurion, Matth. 8.8. and Peter, Luk. 5.8.
                     The ground of this difference, is the vnion of the two Natures in Chriſt, in which reſpect though the Godhead is ſaid to deſcend, Epheſ. 4.9. yet is he neuertheleſſe God, and the ſimilitude of the Humane nature doth not make him ſo like man, as the vnion of the Godhead doth make him vnlike.
                     Firſt, this ſets forth the great loue of Chriſt to man, who in himſelfe did make a vnion betweene two ſo different Natures for our good, and thereby reconciled heauen and earth.
                     Secondly, againſt the Papiſts, who derogate from Chriſts honour, in making many Saints not onely equall, but ſuperior to Chriſt, and ioyne their merits and interceſſion with Chriſt, giuing the Pope more authority then Chriſt; yea, making eue
                           •
                        y poore Maſſe-prieſt aboue Chriſt, becauſe they are to ſacrifice Chriſt in the Maſſe, now the ſacrificer is aboue the ſacrifice.
                     The parts of this compariſon are, firſt, the originall of Chriſt, He came from heauen; this is to be vnderſtood of the perſon of Chriſt, that he had his beginning frō heauen, though according to his humane nature he came from earth, bei
                           •
                        g borne of man. Which obſerue againſt ſome ancient heretikes, who h
                           •

                           •
                         contrary to the Hiſtory of his Natiuity &amp; incarnation, ſet down by the Euangeliſts, as alſo Ioh. 1.14. Gal. 4 4. 1. Tim. 3.16. and furthermore, it is againſt a maine end of the Incarnation of Chriſt, which is to ſanctifie and make holy our nature, our birth, our conception. Therefore though the humane nature be of m
                           •
                        n, yet notwithſtanding Ieſus Chriſt, God and man conſidered in his perſon, is from aboue, of an heauenly off-ſpring.
                     
                        The vſe is, firſt to teach vs how well thoſe prerogatiues agree v
                           •
                        to Chriſt, which the Scriptures do attribute vnto him, that he is the Head of the Church, the Sauiour and Redeemer of mankind, our Mediator and Interceſſor, that hee will bring vs vnto eternall life, euen becauſe he is from Heauen: and ſo none either can claime any of theſe prerogatiues.
                     
                        Vſe 2. That ſo wee ought not eſteeme of Chriſt vilely and b
                           •
                        r
                           •
                        ly as the Iewes did, by looking onely vpon his poore and meane eſtate, but we muſt remember, that he is from heauen.
                     The ſecond part is of Chriſts excellency.
                     
                        Aboue all] Doct. Chriſt is more excell
                           •
                        nt then Man or Angels: the former is manifeſt, the latter is prooued plentifully in the firſt Chapter of the Hebrewes. Some will ſay, What need this doctrine? euery one that is but inſtructed in his Catechiſme can tell this. True, many know, but acknowledge it not aright by their practice: for if we did, then would we not car
                        
                           •
                        y our ſelues ſo proudly as many doe, but we would ſee our baſen
                           •
                        ſſe and vileneſſe, in reſpect of the dignity and excellency of Chriſt, and ſo learne to be humbled. Briefly, the vſe is to teach what high eſteeme wee ought to carry of Chriſt, how greatly to honour and reuerence him. Other vſes alſo may bee drawne from hence: for if Chriſt be aboue all, then is hee able to protect and defend his Church, and to prouide all good things for vs, &amp;c.
                     The third part is concerning man, what hee is firſt, in his condition.
                     
                        He that is of the earth.] Doct. Man in regard of his beginning is of the earth. This doctrine is well knowne, and is prooued vnto vs by theſe Scriptures, Gen. 2.7. Gen. 18.27. Iob 33.6. Man alſo when hee dies, returnes to duſt, now it is a ſure rule, that euery thing is made of that whereinto it is reſolued, as ice and ſnow of water.
                     This inſtruction briefly miniſters vnto euery one matter of humiliation, to conſider our weakeneſſe and baſeneſſe, which ought to be vnto vs as the blacke feet vnto Peacockes, to make vs plucke downe our ſtately feathers, and high minds.
                     Secondly, in his diſpoſition; firſt inward.
                     
                        
                        Is of the earth.] That is, he is wholly earthly minded, and carnally affected. This teacheth vn
                           •
                        o vs firſt, that man naturally ſauoureth of nothing but earthly things, in all the parts both of ſoule and body. Take an inſtance in his vnderſtanding, and wee ſhall ſee it naturally carried vnto carnall and ſenſuall conſtructions. Hence the Iewes did expound the Prophecies of earthly things, dreaming of an earthly Kingdome of Chriſt, as alſo the Diſciples did. Hence the Capernaites dreamed of a carnall eating of Chriſts fleſh, Ioh. 6.52. Hence it was, that when Chriſt ſpake of doing his Fathers will, which he accounted his meate and drinke, the Diſciples interpreted it of earthly food, Ioh. 4.33. So when Chriſt ſpake to the Woman of Samaria of the water of life, ſhe vnderſtood it of the water of Iacobs Well, Ioh. 4.11. So was Nicodemus his vnderſtanding altogether carnall in the matter of Regeneration, though he were a great Docto
                           •
                        .
                     Secondly, this teacheth, whatſoeuer knowledge and other ſpirituall grace a man hath, hee hath it onely from the gift of God, being in himſelfe vtterly deuoid of all, 1. Corin. 2.14. Roman. 8.5.
                     Secondly, in the outward diſpoſition, which is his ſpeech, and it may alſo be referred to his actions and carriage.
                     
                        He ſpeaketh of the earth,] Firſt, frō the connexion of theſe two together, the outward with the inward diſpoſition, we learne, that according to a mans inward diſpoſition and affection, ſo is his ſpeech, vſually, though ſometimes hypocrites may make a faire colour of words, to hide the priuy corruption of their hearts, but vſually it is ſo. See for proofe, Matth. 12.34, 35. Matth. 7.18, 20. for as the heart ſuggeſteth, ſo the tongue vttereth, for this is the hearts interpreter.
                     
                        Vſe, Is to teach vs to iudge both of our ſelues and others, by our owne and their ſpeeches; which if we find to ſauour of earthly things, that our talke is nothing but of the World, and worldly wealth, we may iuſtly ſuſpect our ſ
                           •
                        lues, that our hearts be carnall and vnregenerate. This ſhewes the vanity of that excuſe of many, who will ſay, Why, whatſoeuer I ſay, yet I thinke no ill, I meane well, Matth. 12.37.
                     
                        A ſecond Doctrine, that man of himſelfe cannot declare and deliuer any heauenly Myſteries pertaining to ſaluation. This point Iohn principally intended, thereby to driue the people from him vnto Chriſt, who onely could expound and decl
                           •
                        re vnto them all diuine knowledge of the myſteries of the Kingdome of Heauen. And ſo the Prophets of old, and now all the Miniſters haue not in themſelues the light of knowledge, but are illightened and inſpired by Chriſt, in whom all the treaſures of wiſedome are hid, Ioh. 1.8. Coloſ. 2.3.
                     Firſt, this is a notable euidence of Gods loue towards vs, who hath giuen vs Chriſt Ieſus, the Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda, to open the booke of the myſteries of the King of Heauen, and to reueale them vnto vs, without whom we ſhould otherwiſe haue had no more knowledge then Sauages, and wilde people haue, Reuel. 5.5.
                     Secondly, this is to admoniſh Miniſters that they be not puft vp with pride, and ſwell againſt their brethren, becauſe they haue more knowledge, but to remember that they are men as well as others, and ſo though they haue many helpes to get knowledge, yet it is Chriſt, who by his Spirit muſt illuminate their minds, to giue them ſound vnderſtanding in heauenly matters. And ſecondly that they ought to teach them vnto the people as the Oracles of God: 1. Pet. 4.10.
                     Thirdly, this teacheth the people to regard the Miniſters, remembring that they deliuer the Word of God, and not man, 1. Theſ. 2.13.
                     The laſt clauſe of this 31. verſe is repeated againe, but not in vaine: for the matter was of great weight, and the preiudicate opinion of the Iewes was hard to be remoued; and ſo hee vrgeth it againe vnto them. Secondly, hereby hee maketh way vnto his complaint for their vnbeliefe, that though hee came from heauen, yet they receiued not his teſtimony.

                           He that commeth from aboue, is aboue all: hee that is of the earth, is earthly, and ſpeaketh of the earth: hee that commeth from heauen is aboue all.
                           32 And what he hath ſeene and heard, that he teſtifieth, and 
                                 •
                              o man receiueth his teſtimony.
                        
                     
                     WHich words containe the complaint of Iohn for the incredulity and vnbeliefe of the Iewes. In it are two parts; firſt, the ground and reaſon of his complaint; ſecondly, the complaint it ſelfe. The reaſons or arguments whereby he vrges the greatneſſe of their incredulity are two; firſt, drawne from the excellency of Chriſt, [Hee that is come from heauen is aboue all.] Theſe words, firſt, in that they are twice repeated, and that for the weightineſſe of the matter therein contained, teach Miniſters that they ought not to thinke the bare deliuery of a truth, and that but once ſufficient, but duely to conſider the weight of the matter, and ſo to vrge and preſſe it againe and againe, that hereby as it were by many ſtrokes, they may beat the truth thereof into the hearts of the hearers: Gal. 1.9.
                     Secondly, they ſerue to aggrauate the incredulity of the Iewes. For who ſpake? Was it not Chriſt from heauen, who is ouer all? then the greater is their vnbeliefe that would not receiue his teſtimony. The Doctrine hence ariſing is,
                     The greater the perſon is that deliuereth a truth vnto vs, the greater is the fault if it be lightly regarded by vs. This is proued out of the ſecond of the Hebrewes: For the Apoſtle hauing prooued in the firſt Chapter, that Chriſt is more excellent then the Angels, Chap. 2. verſ. 2, 3. thereupon inferres, that if the Word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and euery tranſgreſſion and diſobedience, receiued a iuſt recompence o
                           •
                         reward, then how can we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalu
                           •
                        tion, preached to vs by Ieſus Chriſt. And this in common equity; for if the King doe ſpeake vnto v
                           •
                        , and we lightly eſteeme of i
                           •
                        , the fault is greater, then if a meane and baſe perſon deliuered the ſame meſſage vnto vs. And the husbandmen were therefore eſpecially deſtroyed, becauſe they regarded not the meſſage

which the Lord ſent vnto them by his only Sonne: Mat. 21.37.38.
                     For this contempt of the meſſage, ſhewes a light eſteeme of the Perſon that deliuers it.
                     The vſe is that which the Apoſtles make, Heb. 12.25. ſee that yee deſpiſe not him that ſpeaketh from aboue. Where he addeth a reaſon drawne from a compariſon betweene Moſes and Chriſt, that if they eſcaped not which deſpiſed him that ſpake from earth, (1) Moſes; much more ſhall not we eſcape that deſpiſe him that ſpeaketh from heauen (1) Chriſt. That the former eſcaped not, appeareth by the example of Mirian, Numb. 12. of Nadab and Abihu, Leu. 10. of the man that gathered ſticke, Numb. 14. of Corah and his companie, of the Iſraelites that would needs fight with the Canaanites againſt Moſes expreſſe commandement, yea and of all the Iſraelites, who periſhed in the wilderneſſe for this cauſe. Now if theſe did not eſcape, how can we?
                     But how ſhall we heare Chriſt ſpeake, who is now in heauen?
                     
                        Anſw. Chriſt ſpeaketh vnto vs by his miniſters, to whom he hath firſt deliuered this meſſage; Heb. 2.3, 4. and therefore Chriſt ſaith; he that heareth you heareth me.
                     
                     Yea, but we ſee no ſuch iudgements come vpon thoſe that contemne the Goſpell.
                     
                        Anſw. It is then becauſe we doe a right obſerue the iudgement of God: for is not the puniſhment of the Iewes for contemning Chriſt and his Goſpell, namely their vtter deſolation and diſperſion, farre greater then any of their Captiuities vnder the times of the Law. Doe we not ſee all thoſe famous Churches of Greece for their light eſteeme of the Goſpell, vtterly deſtroyed, &amp; now in ſlauery to the Turk, and is not Rome now a ſeruant of Antichriſt; a greater plague then to be made the ſlaue of the Turke; 2. Theſſ. 2.9, 10, 11. And if there be no corporall plague, then doth God ſend ſpirituall puniſhments, giuing men vp to hardnes of heart, and reſeruing them to eternall condemnation: 2. Theſ. 1.7, 8, 9. Act. 28.26, 27. which plague of hardnes of heart is ſo much the more fearfull and grieuous by

much leſſe ſenſible it is.
                     The ſecond argument is drawne from the infallible and certaine truth of the Goſpell that Chriſt hath deliuered, verſ. 32. [what he hath heard and ſeene.] which words, firſt, ſhew the certaine truth of his doctrine for hearing and ſeeing are ſenſes of learning, and ſuch proofes are moſt ſure. Secondly, it ſettes forth his manner of deliuering: for he ſpake it not by relation and inſpiration, as the Prophets: but he ſaw, and heard it in heauen, in the boſome of his Father, at the Counſell-table, as it were of the Trinity.
                     The Doctrine hence ariſing is, That the Goſpell deliuered by Chriſt, is a moſt ſure and certaine truth. See Ioh. 1.1.3.2. Pet. 1.16. Luk. 1.2. and therefore Saint Iam. cap. 1.18. fitly calleth it, the Word of Truth, both in regard of the Author, and of the manner of deliuery, and alſo of the effect it worketh in the heart of the receiuers.
                     
                        Vſe. 1. This ſerues to aggrauate the incredulity both of the Iews, &amp; alſo of vs who notwithſtanding theſe cleare euidences, cannot yet be perſwaded of the truth thereof. We will beleeue a man that ſayth, hee both heard and ſaw the thing he reporteth; yet the Goſpell firſt preached by Chriſt, in whom there is nothing, but it makes him worthy to beleeued, after confirmed by the Apoſtles, who were eye-witneſſes, and eare-witneſſes of all that was done, cannot wee be drawne to beleeue: Ioh. 7.48.
                     2. This ſerues to ſtrengthen our faith in the doctrine of the Goſpell deliuered vnto the world; that wee beginne not to doubt, and ſtagger about the truth thereof, but to ſtand conſtantly for the defence and vpholding of the ſame, and euen, if need bee, to ſeale vp the truth of it with our owne blood.
                     3. Chriſts faithfulnes in deliuering that only which he ſaw and heard; ought to teach miniſters to take heed, that they deliuer nothing but what is ſure and certaine; which they haue receiued from Chriſt, and is grounded vpon the Word; otherwiſe they are liable to the Apoſtles reprehenſion: 1. Timo. 1.7.
                     4. This confutes our aduerſaries, who deliuer many points

of doctrine, as neceſſary to ſaluation, which they neuer ſaw nor heare, whereof they haue no ground; as of Purgatory, Limbus, Tranſubſtantiation, &amp;c. Finally, if we will be certainely reſolued in points concerning our ſaluation, we muſt not relye vpon the ſayings, teſtimonies, and opinions of men, but vpon the vndoubted truth of Gods Word.
                     Now come we to the complaint it ſelfe. The fault hee complaineth of, was, that no man receiued his teſtimony. Though Chriſt ſpake from Heauen, though his perſon was moſt excellent, and the truth of his doctrine moſt certaine, yet no man did beleeue it, that is, very few, and in compariſon of thoſe other that beleeued not as nothing.
                     From which inference wee may obſerue this inſtruction, that no euidence will ſatisfie incredulous and obſtinate perſons: ſo the Iewes were perſwaded, the Prophets, and namely, Ieremiah, were inſpired of God, Ier 42.2. yet when he had deliuered his meſſage from God to them, they would not beleeue him, but gaue him the lie, and ſaid, that Baruch did prouoke him againſt the people: Ier. 43.2, 3. So Pharaoh, and the Egyptians would not be perſwaded, euen for their owne good. The Iewes, Act. 4.16. could not deny the truth of thoſe things the Apoſtles had done, yet would they not beleeue. So the Phariſes againſt their owne conſcience ſaid vnto Chriſt, that he caſt out diuels by the Prince; and though they knew he did it by his Diuinity, yet would they not be perſwaded; Mat. 12.24. Thus infidelity cloſeth vp the eyes of a mans reaſon, ſo that, be the proofes and euidences neuer ſo plaine, yet he cannot be perſwaded in his heart.
                     
                        Vſe. Not to thinke any thing the worſe of the truth, though men beleeue it not: for few there are that will beleeue, Eſay 53.1. Rom. 10.16. but the truth of the Goſpell depends not vpon man, but vpon God, Rom. 3.4. Wherefore wee ought not, as many doe, to ſtagger and doubt of the truth, becauſe Papiſts and others after ſo much writing and diſputing, and ſo plaine euidence on our ſides, will not yet beleeue, but ſtill write, and euen die in defence of their errors. For what if an Heretike bee burnt at a ſtake, ſhall we thinke euer the better of his hereſie, or
on

the worſe of Gods truth? God forbid. Let vs rather looke vpon the Word of God, and ſo ground our ſelues thereon, and conſider withall what a man is, if God giue him ouer to the diuell, to incredulity, obſtinacy, and hardneſſe of heart.
                     
                        Receiued] They heard the Word preached, and the truth of it proued vnto them oftentimes by Chriſt, yet they remained incredulous and obſtinate. Which firſt, as it ſerues to aggrauate their hardneſſe of heart and vnbeliefe. Secondly, ſo it yeelds vnto vs this obſeruation. That incredulity and obſtinacy againſt plaine euidence of truth, is not onely proper to the profane and infidels, but to many of them alſo that vſe to heare the Word preached, to frequent Sermons, &amp;c. as the Iewes did, Ezek. 33.31, 32.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 33.
                           He that hath receiued his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeale, that God is true.
                           34. For he whom God hath ſent, ſpeaketh the words of God: For God giueth not the Spirit by meaſure vnto him.
                           35. The Father loueth the Sonne, and hath giuen all things into his hand.
                           36. He that beleeueth on the Sonne, hath euerlaſting life: and he that beleeueth not the Sonne, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.
                        
                     
                     THeſe verſes containe a declaration of Faith, which is ſe
                           •
                         downe, firſt, by the nature and obiect of it, [He that hath receiued his teſtimony.] Secondly, by the excellency of which is laid downe by the effect, [hath ſet to his ſeale that God is true.] Which is confirmed by a reaſon in the next words, [For he whom God hath ſent ſpeaketh the Words of God:] and this ſtrengthened with another reaſon [For God giueth not the Spirit by meaſure vnto him.] The 35. verſe layes downe, firſt, the ground of this latter reaſon, why God giues him the Spirit without meaſure, [The Father loueth the Sonne.] Secondly, a fruite of this loue, [and hath giuen all things into his hand.] Thirdly, Faith is declared by the benefit that comes by it, namely, life euerlaſting, which is further amplified by the contrary of vnbeliefe

what hurt followes vpon, viz. the wrath of God: verſ. 36.
                     
                        He that receiueth his teſtimony] Here Faith is deſcribed by the nature and obiect of it, which is the teſtimony of Chriſt, that is, the Goſpell, whereof Chriſt is the Author. The point of doctrine hence ariſing is, that true faith is onely grounded vpon the Word of God, as Ioh. 17.8. That faith which relyes vpon mans word and authority, brings no honour to God, nor comfort to our owne conſciences.
                     
                        Hath ſet to his ſeale that God is true.] Here is the excellency of faith ſhewed by the effect. That faith ratifieth and confirmeth the truth of God; as Abrahams faith is ſaid to glorifie God, Rom. 4.20. whereas vnbeliefe makes God a lier, 1. Ioh. 5.10. But how can faith ſeale vp the truth of God, or infidelity impeach it? Indeed the truth of God doth not depend vpon man, but vpon the immutability of Gods will; yet Faith is ſaid to ratifie and confirme it, firſt, in regard of the manifeſtation of the truth of God to others: as among men, hee that beleeueth another, doth manifeſt to the world, that accounts him a true and truſty man. Secondly, becauſe it aſſures and aſcertaines vnto our owne hearts and conſciences the truth of God. Thirdly, in regard of Gods acceptation.
                     Infidelity doth impeach the truth of God; not that indeed an vnbeleeuing man can make God a lyer, but becauſe he doth his vttermoſt endeauour as much as in him lyeth, to make him a lyer, by denying and doubting of his truth.
                     This affoords many inſtructions: firſt, that of all other graces, Faith is the moſt neceſſary for a mans own ſelf, becauſe by it we apply the promiſes of God, and the merits of Chriſt vnto our conſciences. Secondly, that likewiſe none is more excellent, becauſe it confirmes the pretious truth of God. Thirdly, that this is the moſt acceptable grace, becauſe it ſanctifies all other; without it, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. Fourthly, this ſhewes the great reſpect that God hath to man, that hee doth accept a teſtimony from him. Fifthly, againe, that faith doth on our part to God, that which the Spirit doth on Gods part to vs; this aſſures vs of Gods truth, that ſeales vp the truth of God, as Chriſt by his Spirit is knit and vnited to vs, wee by faith to him.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 34.
                           For he whom God hath ſent, ſpeaketh the words of God: for God giueth not the Spirit by meaſure vnto him.
                        
                     
                     
                        FOr he whom God hath ſent, ſpeaketh the words of God.] Here is laid downe a reaſon, of that which was ſpoken of the excellency of faith in ſealing vp the truth of God, drawne frō the office of Chriſt. The reaſon ſtands thus: He that receiueth his teſtimony whom God hath ſent, and who ſpeaketh the words of God, hee ſealeth that God is true: but hee that receiueth Chriſts teſtimony, receiueth his teſtimony, that is, ſent from God, and that ſpeaketh the words of God. Therefore he that receiueth the teſtimony of Chriſt ſealeth that God is true. Or more briefly thus: Chriſts teſtimony are the words of God; therefore he that receiueth Chriſts teſtimony, ſealeth that God is true. This 34. verſe then containeth two parts:
                     Firſt, the Office of Chriſt, with the condition, or effect of it.
                     Secondly, the gifts of Chriſt, and the quantity of them:
                     The Office is ſet downe in theſe words [He whom God hath ſent.] Which phraſe of ſending, is generally applyed to all the Meſſengers and Miniſters of God from time to time, both before and after Chriſt, 2. Chron. 24.19. Ioh. 1.6. Ioh. 13.20. And it notes three things: Firſt, the kind and quality of their Office, that they are Miniſters and Meſſengers. Secondly, the warrant of their calling; God ſends them. Thirdly, that they are deputed, and ſet apart to that calling. But particularly, it is here vnderſtood of Chriſt, and in the generall, it ſetteth forth thus much, That Chriſt tooke not vnto him this Calling and Office of himſelfe, but God did appoint him, as the Apoſtle prooues, Heb. 5.4, 5, 6.
                     More particularly it ſheweth, that Chriſt was ſent from heauen, euen from the boſome of his Father, to take fleſh vpon him to declare vnto vs the ſecret counſell of God, and to work our redemption, as Gal. 4.4. Ioh. 10.36.
                     But it will bee obiected, that in this reſpect Chriſt is very God, and then how can he be ſent.
                     
                        
                        Anſw. Yes, very well, if we conſider the diſtinction of perſons; for there is no inconuenience to ſay, that one perſon may ſend another, as Chriſt is alſo ſaid to ſend the holy Ghoſt. Yea but then one perſon ſhall be inferiour to another? We anſwer, Firſt, that there may bee a ſending among equals. Secondly, more particularly and properly we ſay, that Chriſt, firſt, in regard of the humane nature which hee tooke into the vnity of perſon with the D
                           •
                        ity. Secondly, in regard of the Office of his mediatorſhip, is inferior to the Father: Ioh. 14.28. Phil. 2.7.
                     
                        Doct. Chriſt was deputed of God to be his Meſſenger, and his Miniſter; a phraſe much vſed in Scripture; as Eſay 61.1. prooued to bee ſpoken of Chriſt by Luk. 4.18. Zach. 2.9, 11. 1. Ioh. 4.10. and Malac. 3.1. Chriſt is expreſſely called, the Meſſenger of the Couenant; and Rom. 15.8. a Miniſter.
                     For firſt, none but Chriſt was fit to doe this, who onely knew all the ſecret councels of God; Ioh. 1.18.
                     Secondly, none was able to performe the worke, but he that was both God and man.
                     For vſe of this point; firſt, this manifeſteth Gods loue vnto vs, that when we had no meanes to come to the knowledge of his will, and to life eternall, he ſent his onely Sonne to bring vs vnto both, as in the 16. verſe of this Chapter. Secondly, this ſheweth that great reſpect that he beareth to mankind, in ſending ſo great and honourable an Embaſſadour vnto him. As among men, what greater honour then for a King to ſend his ſonne in embaſſage to a poore man. Thirdly, it ſetteth forth vnto vs that great loue and reſpect that Chriſt Ieſus bare towards vs, in that he diſdaind not to take vpon him this office to be made a Meſſenger of God for our good, which we are well to note, that hereby we may learne to prize Gods loue according to the worth of it, and ſo to loue him againe. Fourthly, this is matter of comfort vnto vs, that thoſe things which Chriſt performeth, are acceptable to God, becauſe God himſelfe appointed him to this worke. Fifthly and laſtly, it is exemplary for our imitation, that if we will haue comfort in the things we take in hand, we muſt looke, firſt, that the calling be warranted of God. Secondly, that our ſelues be deputed, and ſet apart to

that Calling, 1. Cor. 7.17. That the Calling is appointed of God, we ſhall know if it be warranted in the Word; and that the Calling is ordained for vs, if wee find our ſelues mooued thereunto by the Spirit of God, and inabled with gifts to diſcharge it. This makes againſt Maſſe-Prieſts, and vnſufficient Miniſters, Ier. 23.21.
                     
                        He ſpeaketh the words of God,] Which is the effect of his Office. The Doctrine is, That Chriſt being appointed a Meſſenger of his Father, was carefull to declare the Minde, Will, and Word of his Father; as himſelfe witneſſeth, Ioh. 7.16. Ioh. 14.24. Ioh. 17.6, 8. and Heb. 3.2. Chriſt is faithfull, as Moſes was: for this is a maine end why his Office was laid vpon him: Ioh. 6.38.
                     
                        Vſe is, firſt, it is a further motiue to preſſe the point and matter in hand, that we ſhould be attentiue vnto the Word, becauſe Chriſt brought it from heauen. So that if either the Author of it, namely, God; or the meſſenger, that is, Chriſt can mooue vs, it ſerues to enforce that exhortation which the Apoſtle hath, Heb. 2.1. that we doe not let ſhip this Word.
                     Secondly, it teacheth Miniſters to haue a care that they bee like vnto Chriſt, to iuſtifie that they are ſent of God, by ſpeaking nothing but Gods Word. Which firſt is Gods commandement, Ezek. 3.10. Ezek. 33.7. Mat. vlt. vlt. Ierem. 23.21. Secondly, the example of the Saints ſhewes it; ſo did the Prophets alwaies ſpeake in the Name of the Lord. And the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 11.23. Thirdly, this will gaine reuerence and attention vnto their Miniſtery, 1. Theſ. 2.13. Fourthly, herein lyeth a maine difference betweene faithfull and vnfaithfull Miniſters.
                     Now from the force of this reaſon ariſeth this Doctrine, that to receiue their teſtimony that are ſent of God, and that ſpeake the words of God, is to ſeale the truth of God. Which as it is vnderſtood here of Chriſt, ſo is it true of all other Miniſters vpon that ground: Luk. 10.16. Ioh. 13.20. See Exod. 14. vlt. 2. Chron. 20.20. Act. 13.48. The reaſon hereof is drawne from their Office, becauſe they are ſent of God, and are Embaſſadors of Chriſt ſtanding in his ſtead: 2. Cor. 5.20.
                     
                        
                        Vſe. This ought to breed reuerence in mens hearts to the Miniſtery, becauſe they haue not to doe herein onely with men, but with God, who is honoured when the Miniſtery is honoured, deſpiſed, and contemned, when it is reiected: 1. Sam. 8.7. Ezek. 20.8.
                     Secondly, it ſerues to vphold Miniſters againſt the deſpite of thoſe, who contemne their Miniſtery, becauſe of their infirmities and weakeneſſes: but man ought to conſider not the perſon, but the office.
                  
               
               
                  AN EXPOSITION VPON THE FIRST OF MARKE.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Mark. 1.25.
                           And Ieſus rebuked him, ſaying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
                        
                     
                     
                        THeſe words are a part of the Hiſtory of our Lords diſpoſſeſſing of a Diuell; of which Hiſtory were foure parts: firſt, the place, verſ. 23. Secondly, the deſcription of the party poſſeſſed, ibid. Thirdly, the manner of diſpoſſeſſing of him; where firſt is ſet downe the Diuels ſtriuing againſt it: ſecondly, how Chriſt reſiſted him. Fourthly, the effects of this Miracle: verſ. 26, 27.
                     
                        And Ieſus rebuked him] Chriſt hath abſolute authority ouer Diuels, not onely as God, but as Mediatour: which is for our comfort; for as Mediatour he came to diſſolue the workes of the Diuell.
                     
                        Saying.] The charge of Chriſt is twofold; firſt, Hold thy peace, or be mufled, as 1. Tim. 5.18. But why would not Chriſt

receiue the teſtimony of the Diuell. Becauſe:
                     Firſt, the ground of this confeſſion was not good; it was not loue, but a ſlauiſh feare that made him, as a ſlaue ready to bee beaten, giue good words to his Maſter.
                     Secondly, in regard of the matter, it was in ſome reſpects true, but not in all.
                     Thirdly, in regard of the manner, it was deceitfully vttered by him.
                     Fourthly, in regard of his perſon, he was not fit to giue teſtimony of Chriſt; and if he had receiued it, it might haue confirmed that ſlanderous opinion of the Phariſes of compacting with him.
                     Secondly, Come out of him. Chriſt needs nothing to ouercome the Diuell but onely his bare Word: So Matth. 4. though he ſuffered the Diuell to doe much, yet at his Word away he hies. Which ſhewes the difference betweene Chriſts caſting out of Diuels, and others: He, by his owne command; they in his name: he hy his Word, they by Prayer and Faſting.
                     Further, in regard of the party, note the goodneſſe of Chriſt towards mankind, which as particularly he ſhewed to this man here, ſo will he to euery one of vs, in deliuering vs from the ſlauery of the Diuell.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 26.
                           And the vncleane ſpirit tare him, and cryed with a loud voyce, and came out of him.
                        
                     
                     
                        L

                           ke addeth, He threw him in the middeſt, Chap. 4.35. and hurt him nothing at all.
                     
                     The Diuels obedience to the charge of Chriſt, obſerue herein, firſt, the manner. ſecondly, the thing it ſelfe: thirdly, the iſſue.
                     1. The manner, firſt, Hee threw him in the middeſt. This ſhewes his rage and fury. Secondly, he tare him; that is, there were ſo ſore and grieuous conuulſions in his body, as if one limme had been pulled from another. Thirdly, he cryed out with a loud voice for horror and feare of Chriſt. What now

ſhould be the reaſon of all this violence? euen becauſe hee was now to abandon his hold. Hence marke this point, The laſt conflict with Satan is commonly the ſoreſt and greateſt. This is to be obſerued in all other demoniakes. Memorable is that of Chriſt, Ioh. 14.30. when the Diuell was now at the point to be fully ouerthrowne.
                     Firſt, the ground is, becauſe he ſtill ſeeketh to deuoure, and man is his pray, and ſo like a Lyon he roareth when the prey is pluckt out of his m
                           •
                        uth. So Pharaoh vexed the Iſraelites more when they were going away then before; which is to be noted to comfort and vphold vs. And ſecondly, in regard of others, to order our iudgements concerning them, if wee ſee them in any extraordinary conflict, ſeeing happily this may be the laſt. In the firſt of thoſe circumſtances, obſerue how far the diuell may preuaile with man, if God permit him, that is, to torment his body, &amp;c. as appeares in Iob. In the third, marke how terrible Chriſt is vnto the Diuell.
                     Secondly, his obedience it ſelfe is noted, in that He came out: note, firſt, that the Diuell cannot reſiſt Chriſt, becauſe no proportion betweene the infinite power of the Creator, and that finite of the creature. Which ſhewes, that the power and authority which Chriſt hath, is not titular, but effectuall; in that he hath authoritie to command, ſo hee hath power to ſee his commands executed. Which teacheth vs to reſort and truſt to him.

                           And they were all amaz

                              d, inſomuch that they queſtioned among themſelues, ſaying, What thing is this? What word is this? Luk. 4.36. What new doctrine is this? For with authority commanded he the vncleane ſpirits, and they obey him.
                           28. And immediately his fame ſpread abroad throughout all the Regions round about Galilee.
                        
                     
                     IN theſe words are contained the effects of this miracle. Firſt, the aſtoniſhment of thoſe that were preſent.
                     Secondly, the vſe they made of it, note here, firſt, how they

enquired and communed of it one to another. Secondly, their particular queſtions. Thirdly, the reaſon of it.
                     1. Their inquiring after this matter is firſt noted in way of reproofe, to taxe their ignorance and negligence, that they were not acquainted with the Scriptures and Prophecies concerning Chriſt, that it ſhould be he that ſhould confound the power of Satan, nor had attended vnto the preaching of Iohn, nor vnto Chriſts former Sermons, wherein he had declared himſelfe to be the Meſſias. Where we may ſee what followes vpon neglect of the miniſtery of the Word, that men are euer learning, yet come not to knowledge. Neuertheleſſe, in that they doe inquire, is commendable in them, and ſet forth for our imitation, and without it we ſhall neuer make profit of the Word.
                     2. By their particular queſtions, we may ſee the fruit of due attention. Firſt, they inquire into the nature of the Miracle, [What thing is this] for when once by diligent attention the mind hath receiued a deepe impreſſion, it is neuer ſatisfied, till it hath gotten the full knowledge of the thing. Secondly, they come to conſider of the principall circumſtance of the miracle, viz. the meane of performance, [What word is this?] Laſtly, they goe further, and apply the miracle to the right end of it, viz. the confirmation of a Doctrine, which for the high account and eſtimation they had of it, they called New; not in diſdaine to diminiſh the authority of it. A thing is ſaid to be new, when it is done in another manner then it hath vſually been.
                     3. The reaſon was; For with, &amp;c.
                     
                     The Fame and report of Chriſt, (which is another effect of this Miracle.) Firſt, ſpread abroad, namely, by the good prouidence of God, that Chriſt and his doctrine might be the better entertained whereſoeuer he became. Wherein Gods goodneſſe to the Church appeares, that thereby many came to reape profit by that which was done amongſt a few. Wherefore our duty is to publiſh the workes of God: which alſo was commanded by Chriſt to many whom he cured. For firſt, this is a ſpeciall meanes to amplifie the glory of God. Secondly, to increaſe and edifie the Church. Thirdly, to hinder other idle and vaine rumors, when our care is to ſpeake of the works of God.
                     
                        2. In the intent, it ſpread abroad throughout all the Countrey; teaching vs, that it is not ſufficient for vs to make knowne to our familiars and next neighbours, the great workes of God, but alſo to ſtrangers as occaſion ſerues: auoiding partiality, and hindering the knowledge of Gods workes, by ſtaying the fame thereof.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 29.
                           And forthwith when they were come out of the Synagogue, they entred into the houſe of Simon and Andrew with Iames and Iohn.
                           30. But Simons wiues mother lay ſicke of a Feuer, and anon they told him of her.
                           31. And he came and tooke her by the hand, and lift her vp, and immediately the Feuer left her, and ſhe miniſtred vnto them.
                        
                     
                     THis is the tenth Hiſtory of the firſt yeere of Chriſts publike miniſtery, and the fifth miracle, following immediately after the former hiſtorie and miracle of the diſpoſſeſſing of the Diuell, as is cleare by Marke, Forthwith, verſ. 29. and Luk. 4.38. he aroſe out of the Synagogue, and entred into Simons houſe, &amp;c. Mat. 8.14, 15. places it otherwiſe: but firſt two are to be preferred before one. Secondly, Matthew of all other is leaſt carefull to obſerue the order of times in ſetting downe his ſtories, regarding rather the likeneſſe of the matter, and the place where they were; as laying downe a great many Parables together in one place, in another a great many miracles, &amp;c. Thirdly, Matthew there vſeth an indefinite propoſition, which implies no immediate conſequence of that, that followes on that which goes before. And generally, we muſt haue an eye to Luke for our order, and next to him to Marke.
                     
                     The Euangeliſts that record this Hiſtory are three, Matth. 8.14, 15. Mark. 1.29. Luk. 4.35. Let vs compare the differences of them in handling of this ſtory, which are either in addition of circumſtances, or variety of phraſes.
                     
                        Matthew is the conciſeſt of the reſt, touching onely the ſubſtance of the ſtory. Therefore by the way note, that i
                           •
                         is an error

to ſay, that Marke is an epitome of Matthew, as firſt may appeare by this: ſecondly, becauſe he obſerues another order: thirdly, and alſo hath more Hiſtories then the other.
                     
                        Matthew and Marke adde, this woman was laid on her bed.
                     
                     Secondly, that Chriſt touched her. Marke addes, that hee lift her vp.
                     
                     Thirdly, Matthew hath, that being healed, ſhe aroſe.
                     
                     
                        Marke and Luke firſt adde the tranſition, which Matth
                              •
                           w hath not; and forthwith when they were come out of the Synagogue, &amp;c.
                     
                     Secondly, that thoſe that were preſent, made the womans caſe knowne vnto Chriſt.
                     
                        Marke he is moſt large, and addes, firſt, that Chriſt made no delay, Forthwith: ſecondly, the houſe of Simon and Andrew.
                     
                     Laſtly, Luke addes; firſt, that the Feuer was great. Secondly, that Chriſt ſtood ouer her, and rebuked the Feuer. Thirdly, that immediately ſhe aroſe.
                     
                     In variety of phraſes, as Peter, and Simon, ſicke of a Feuer, and taken with a Feuer, &amp;c.
                     
                     The ſumme of this Hiſtory is a miraculous curing of Simons wiues mother. The parts of it are theſe: firſt, the Time. Secondly, the place. Thirdly, the Parties preſent before whom▪ Fourthly, the party cured. Fiftly, the manner of curing. Sixthly, the manifeſtation of this to bee a Miracle. Seuenthly, the euent of it.
                     The time was, aſſoone as he came forth of the Synagogue, and it hath a double relation, either to the former Miracle, or to the aſſembly and meeting of Gods people, verſ. 22. in regard of which relation wee may note, firſt, that Chriſt counted it a proper worke of the Sabbath, to doe a worke of mercy. Secondly, that Chriſt contented not himſelfe to haue performed the publike worſhip of God on the Sabbath, but as occaſion was offered, did alſo other good workes.
                     Which is for our vſe, that among other duties of the Sabbath, to haue a ſpeciall regard to the workes of mercy, it being a good meanes to fill our hearts with godly meditations, and our mouthes with holy conference.
                     
                        Secondly, that wee content not our ſelues with the publike ſeruice of God onely, but bee carefull to ſpend the reſt of the Sabbath after the aſſemblies.
                     The place where it was wrought, was, firſt, a priuat houſe. Here obſerue, that Chriſt was ready to manifeſt the gift which God had beſtowed vpon him in doing good, not onely openly before many, but in priuate houſes alſo before a few; as Ioh. 2.1. at a priuate marriage of a poore couple hee wrought his firſt miracle: and Matth. 9.23. becauſe it was not a popular applauſe that he ſought for, but doing of good to the Church, and for it he was as ready in one place as another. Howbeit, moſt of his miracles were publike, becauſe hereby, firſt, God was moſt glorified: ſecondly, more did reape benefit: thirdly, his Miniſtery more credited.
                     The vſe is for vs to doe the like in doing good to all, in all places indifferently, as occaſion ſhall ſerue. For to doe nothing but what many may take notice of, ſauoureth of arrogancy and deſire of glory, rather then zeale of Gods glory, and good of their brother.
                     Secondly, It was the houſe of Simon and Andrew; where a queſtion may be moued, how it is ſaid to be the houſe of Simon and Andrews both?
                     
                        Anſw. It was either becauſe both had right to it, or becauſe both of them dwelt together. To that, Ioh. 1.44. I anſwer, That their breeding might bee at Bethſaida; and yet becauſe of their Trade of fiſhing, they might haue a houſe at Capernaum. Secondly, Peter might dwell there becauſe of his wife. Thirdly, becauſe Chriſt did dwell there to entertaine him.
                     To that Luk. 5.11. I anſwer, they forſooke all, that is, all that might hinder them in following of Chriſt, as their calling. Secondly, the vſe of all, but not the poſſeſſion.
                     Now this ſhewes the brotherly agreement betweene theſe two brothers; a thing highly commended in Scripture; as Pſal. 133.1, 2, 3.
                     Secondly, though they ſuffered nothing to hinder them in following of Chriſt, yet they did not fondly caſt away that they had. Matthew made Chriſt a Feaſt in his owne houſe after

he had forſooke all: Luk. 5.28, 29. For riches are Gods bleſſings, and haue a good vſe, wherein they are to bee imployed, if they croſſe not greater matters. Secondly, we are Gods Stewards, and no Steward may caſt away his Maſters goods. This confutes the Anabaptiſts, and ſome ancient Philoſophers, which caſt their money in the Sea.
                     The company preſent were the foure Diſciples, verſ. 29. who were companions together, Luk. 5.7. Here note, firſt, the care of Chriſt to traine them vp, becauſe hee meant to make them Apoſtles; and ſo he made them eye-witneſſes of his Miracles and Doctrine, for the further ſtrengthening of their Faith, that they might haue the greater euidence to preach Chriſt vnto others. This ought to be the practice of Tutors. This did Paul with Timothy. Secondly, their care and diligence to doe him ſeruice in attending on him, who was their Maſter. Thirdly, the Diſciples deſire to profit by Chriſt.
                     The party cured, was Simons wiues mother. Where wee may note, that Chriſt thought it not an vnfit thing to take a married man for his Diſciple. But ſome obiect againſt this, and ſay, that by a wiſe, 1. Cor. 9.5. is meant another woman? which is both ſlanderous and rediculous. See Heb. 13.4. in all, marriage is honourable, and in Miniſters: 1. Tim. 3.5. 1. Tim. 4.3:
                     Secondly, in that Peter had a carefull reſpect of his wiues mother, we learne, that husbands and wiues ſhould haue a pious reſpect of the parents each of other, as appeares in Ruth to Naomi, and Moſes to Iethro. The reaſon of it, is the Law of marriage, Gen. 2. by which bond they are to extend their affection to the parents of one another. Secondly, this is a great meanes to breed loue and kindneſſe betweene themſelues, when the one ſeeth how much the other reſpecteth his friends.
                     Secondly, her diſeaſe wherewith ſhe was afflicted, was, firſt, a hot burning Feuer: ſecondly, a great Feuer: thirdly, ſhe was ſo ſicke of it, 
                           •
                        hat ſhe was faine to lye downe: fourthly, ſhe was healed of it. All which circumſtances do amplifie the diſeaſe, ſhewing it to be grieuous and dangerous. Whence learne we, That there is no diſeaſe ſo dangerous, but Chriſt can cure it;

becauſe the abſoluteneſſe of his power is ſuch, that with him there is no reſpect of greatneſſe or ſmalneſſe. Teaching vs hereby to truſt perfectly vnto him in all our diſtreſſes, it being he alone that can giue to others wiſedome to preſcribe, and to the meanes power to effect our health and welfare.
                     The manner of curing. Here note the occaſion; Mat. 8.14. ſaith, Chriſt ſaw her. Marke, that they told him of her. Luke, that they intreated him for her.
                     
                     Firſt, then the ſight of our miſeries moues Chriſt to ſuccour vs; as Mark. 6.34. Ioh. 5.6. becauſe the eyes of Chriſt are eyes of pitty, like to thoſe of the Samaritan: Luk. 10. Which ſerues to miniſter comfort to vs in all miſeries. See Ezek. 16.3, 4, 5, &amp;c. And albeit that Chriſt doth alwaies ſee our miſeries, yet muſt we put him in minde of them, that he may ſee how wee are affected with them our ſelues.
                     2. In that they told him, and intreated him for her: this ſhewes, firſt, their faith in Chriſt: ſecondly, their loue and pitty to her. Teaching vs in like caſes to giue an euidence of our faith and brotherly loue, by commending the caſes of our brethren to Chriſt. For as he is beſt able to helpe in all diſtreſſes, ſo firſt, it is an honour done vnto him: ſecondly, it is a meanes to obtaine helpe for them: thirdly, it is a ſacrifice acceptable to God, and we are accepted as worſhippers of him.
                     The meanes of curing, reſpect partly the geſture, partly, the ſpeech of Chriſt.
                     The geſture: He came vnto her, tou
                              •
                           hed her, and lift her vp: all to ſhew, that this cure came of him. Chriſt was able to doe it without theſe meanes, but hee did it to giue a greater euidence. And falſe is that collection of the Vbiquitaries vpon Mark. 5.31. that in the fleſh of Chriſt was a vertue to heale, becauſe the diuine qualities were transfuſed in the fleſh.
                     
                        Doct. Where Chriſt will, any meanes are powerfull as clay to 
                           〈◊〉
                         blindneſſe, Ioh. 9.6. Moſes Rod to fetch water out of a Rocke, Numb. 20.9. Act. 19.12. for Chriſt is the Fountaine of all power and efficacy.

they may ſeeme to vs, not oppoſing our conceits againſt this power and wiſedome of God: as Naaman did, and both Iewes and Gentiles in ſpeaking againſt the Goſpell, the meanes of ſaluation.
                     Secondly, his ſpeech; Luke ſaith, hee rebuked the Feuer. Chriſt hath an abſolute command not onely ouer reaſonable and liuing creatures, but alſo ouer things inſenſible.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 32.
                           And at Euen when the Sunne did ſet, or, [when the Sunne was downe] they brought to him all that were diſeaſed, and them that were poſſeſſed with Diuels.
                           33 And the whole City was gathered together at the doore.
                           34 And he healed many that were ſicke of diuers diſeaſes, and caſt out many Diuels, and ſuffered not the Diuels to ſay, that they knew him.
                        
                     
                     THeſe words containes a generall Hiſtory of Chriſt his miraculous curing of ſundry perſons, diuerſly afflicted. It is in number the eleuenth Hiſtory of the firſt yeere: recorded by three Euang
                           •
                        liſts; Marke here; Luk. 4.40, 41. and Matth. 8.16, 17. The differences betweene them are partly in addition.
                     1. Matthew addes, firſt, the meanes whereby theſe cures were wrought, his Word, verſ. 16.
                     Secondly, a Prophecy that went before of Chriſt was now fulfilled, verſ. 17.
                     2. Marke addes the whole 33. verſe.
                     3. Luke, who is the moſt copious, addes, firſt, a ſecond meanes of cure, laying on of his hands, verſ. 40.
                     Secondly, that the Diuels came out crying.
                     Thirdly, Chriſts indignation againſt them, rebuked them.
                     
                     Fourthly, he addes this clauſe, the Chriſt.
                     
                     Partly in variety of phraſes, as Matthew; VVhen Euen was come. Marke and Luke; When the Sunne was downe, or, Euen now a ſetting. Marke, they brought. Luke, they all brought. Matthew hath, poſſeſſed with Diuels. Luke, diſeaſed. Marke hath both. Matthew, Marke, that Ch
                              •
                           iſt caſt out. Luke, that the Diuels came out; being in effect all one.
                     
                        The ſeuerall branches of this Hiſtory are, firſt, the Time: ſecondly, the Occaſion: thirdly, the Parties cured: fourthly, the Witneſſes preſent: fifthly, the Manner of working this miracle: ſixthly, the Manifeſtation thereof: ſeuenthly, the Effect: eightly, the End, viz. the accompliſhment of the Prophecy.
                     The Time; When Euening was come, viz. the Euen of the ſame day whereupon Chriſt had done ſo much before, as the inference ſhewes plainely.
                     
                        Doct. Chriſt is euer ready to doe one good after another, as occaſion is offered. A thing often noted in him; as after the long Sermon, Matth. 5.6, 7. in the eight Chapter are ſet downe more workes which he did preſently after; becauſe he accounted of this life as of a time of worke, Ioh. 9.4. and ſo he did improue this time.
                     Which teacheth vs to learne the like diligence vpon the ſame ground of the ſhortneſſe of life, labouring here, looking for our reſt hereafter, Heb. 4.8.
                     Secondly, It is ſaid, the Sunne was downe, and Euening was come. Now this ſeemes a time of reſt, and vnſeaſonable for ſuch buſineſſe.
                     
                        Doct. No time was vnſeaſonable to Chriſt to doe good, he conferres with Nicodemus in the night: Ioh. 3. with the woman of Samaria, weary and hungry; Ioh. 4. The reaſon, becauſe Chriſt did eſteeme the doing of Gods will aboue his meat, drinke, and reſt, Ioh. 4.34. and ſo muſt we doing good workes both in, and out of ſeaſon, 2. Tim. 4.2. and it is a reproofe for thoſe that will doe good, but it ſhall be onely at ſeaſonable and fit times.
                     Thirdly, Luke ſaith, [the Sunne was ſetting.] Marke, [When the Sunne was ſet.] Here ſeemeth to be ſome contradiction.
                     
                        Anſw. The Sunne was ſcarce downe, and yet it was euen now downe, when as they brought their ſicke vnto him; ſo that the Sonne was but newly ſet.
                     The reaſon why they brought not their ſicke, till the Sunne was downe, was, becauſe the Iewes did hold the workes of mercy vnlawfull to be done on the Sabbath day, as Mat. 12.2, 10. Luk. 13.14. &amp; 14.2. Ioh. 5.9, 10. Ioh. 9.16. therefore in regard

hereof they bring them not till the Euening, their Sabbath then ending, as they thought. Where note we, that ſuperſtition makes men neglect their owne good, and the good of their friends. Chriſt might haue been gone away to ſome other place, or haue taken himſelfe to his reſt, and would not cure them, and other caſualties might haue come betweene. For ſuperſtition blindeth the iudgement, that it cannot diſcerne betweene things conuenient and vnconuenient, but wholly doteth on the thing conceited. Wee ſhall auoide ſo dangerous a thing, if we attend to the Word, and looke that thoſe things which we maintaine, bee grounded vpon the Word of God: Heb. 13.9.
                     The Occaſion that mooued Chriſt to worke theſe Miracles was, becauſe there were brought vnto him fit obiects to work vpon. Hence we learne, that the charitable workes of other in bringing their ſicke to Chriſt, gaue him occaſion to heale them. Reaſon was, firſt, to ſhew the goodneſſe of his nature, not onely when the perſons themſelues ſue vnto him, but alſo when others intreate for them. Secondly, to ſhew how he approoues the good mind of others herein, as alſo their Faith.
                     More particular circumſtances to be noted, are, firſt, the generality; all brought their ſicke.
                     
                     
                        Doct. All of all ſorts are ready to ſeeke remedies for the cure of bodily diſeaſes: A Ruler, Ioh. 4.46. a Begger: Mark. 14.46. a Canaanitiſh woman, Matth. 15.22. becauſe theſe outward diſeaſes are ſenſible. This will be a witneſſe againſt vs all, that are ſo careleſſe in ſeeking redreſſe for our ſpirituall maladies.
                     Secondly, the manner of bringing. Luke ſaith, they led them by the hand. Marke, that they brought them. Noting hereby, that ſuch was their care for their friends, that they thought it not enough to tell them of a remedy, but they brought them to the place where it was to be had: ſo Mark. 6.56. The cauſe of it was the greatneſſe of their Faith in Chriſt to cure all diſeaſes, and of their lou
                           •
                         to their brethren.
                     Vſe is for our imitation, not onely in the temporall good of our friends, but in the ſpirituall health of their ſoules, by bringing

them to the meanes of ſaluation; ſuch eſpecially as are vnder our authoritie.
                     The Parties cured. Note here Two points. Firſt, the generalitie of them Matthew and Marke, ſay all; Luke, euery one: and that this all, were not a few; Marke ſaith, that hee cured many.
                     
                     2. The kindes of maladies noted to haue beene; Firſt, in generall, diuers diſeaſes, ſome dangerous, ſome deadly, ſome infectious, &amp;c. Secondly, in particular, poſſeſſions of Diuels.
                     
                        Doct. Firſt, that Chriſt in doing good, ſhewes himſelfe to bee no reſpecter of perſons: all that came were healed▪ none loſt their labour; Act. 10.34. Ioh. 6.37. For the ground of Chriſts actions is in himſelfe, and his owne goodneſſe, not in any thing whatſoeuer in man.
                     
                        Vſe. For comfort and incouragement for all, in all diſtreſſes, to haue recourſe vnto Chriſt. Secondly, for imitation that in doing of good, we reſpect not the perſon, but the occaſion that God offereth. This ought Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Phyſitians, Councellors, &amp;c. to do; Iam. 2.1. Thirdly, for reproofe of thoſe that reſpect Greatneſſe, Friends, Money, &amp;c.
                     
                        Doct. Secondly, Chriſt was not weary of well doing. He healed a multitude; teaching vs not to bee diſcouraged in comming to Chriſt, becauſe we ſee many goe; but to conſider that his power and ability is not ſtinted, but infinite as himſelfe, like a neuer dried Fountaine.
                     Among the diſeaſes that Chriſt healed, there were no doubt, ſome loathſome, and ſome infectious: heare obſerue. Firſt, Chriſt loathed none of them, being full of pittie, and the more grieuous the diſeaſe, the more pittifull. Which giues vs comfort and confidence to goe vnto him, though neuer ſo loathſome and contemptible in our owne eyes; yea, the rather becauſe of i
                           •
                        ; and further teacheth vs to be of a like minde towards others. Secondly, that Chriſt was not capable of infection, which as it is gathered here in generall, ſo it expreſly Matth. 8.3. prooued, by curing the Leper. For Chriſt was not infected with our perſonall diſeaſes, being from the corruption of our nature.
                     
                        Laſtly, that Chriſt was able to cure all, it ſhewes him to be a ſufficient and perfect Sauiour, both willing and powerfull to doe vs good. The application which the Prophet makes, in Matthew. 8.17. proues this.
                     The witneſſes preſent, were the whole Citie, that is, many of the people of the Citie. Per Metonim. Subiecti. And Synecdoc. Totius proparte. Such phraſes in Scripture are vſuall. Neither are we to ſearch too curiouſly, nor condemne a man of vntruth preſently, if he vſe ſuch a phraſe. That ſo many aſſembled, it ſhewes rather the good prouidence of God, then any goodneſſe in them, being by him brought to paſſe for his Glory, and the good of the Church, and the clearing of the innocency of Chriſt his Sonne, and his plaine dealing; ſeeing the Phariſes and others counted him an impoſtor. But what profit theſe Capernaites made of theſe miracles may appeare; Mat. 11.23. Ioh. 6.
                     The meanes which Chriſt vſed were:
                     1. His Word, Chriſt hath an abſolute command ouer the Diuell. So wee are to truſt in Chriſt, if wee feare the Diuell. And this we muſt doe when we ſee no outward meanes. For Chriſt can worke by his owne Word, without any meanes.
                     2. His laying on of his hands: not that this was any Phyſicall meanes, but to ſhew that the cure came from him.
                     The manifeſtation of theſe miracles to be true miracles, is ſet forth by diuers branches.
                     1. From the generalitie, no diſeaſe ſo deadly, but Chriſt cured it, no ſpirit ſo ſtrong, but Chriſt diſpoſſeſſed him.
                     2. From the ti
                           ••
                        . It was done ſo ſhortly and ſuddenly. So miraculouſly. For time is required to things done by courſe of Nature.
                     3. The cure wrought ſo perfectly.
                     4. That theſe things were done without any naturall meanes.
                     5. That the Diuells came out crying, that is, vnwillingly, and flatteringly.
                     6. That Chriſt did not ſeeke to colour any thing, but did it in view of all. Wherefore Chriſt being thus able to doe miracles,

he is to be truſted vnto, aboue meanes.
                     The Eff
                              •
                           cts are two: Firſt, in regard of the Diuell. And Secondly, in regard of Chriſt.
                     Of the Diuels, that Firſt, they came out; Secondly, they cried; Thirdly, they confeſſed Chriſt the Sonne of God. The Firſt, ſheweth their inforced obedience; The Second, that they ſtand in dread and awe of Chriſt; The Third, they had knowledge of Chriſt, though not by themſelues, but by the Church; hearing the Prophets point at him. So that euen the Diuels many times doe profit more by the Word, then men of Chriſt. Firſt, that he rebuked the Diuell; ſhewing his diſlike of him, and indignation againſt him.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Marke 2.1.
                           And againe, he entred into Capernaum after ſome dayes, and it was noiſed that he was in the houſe.
                           2. And ſtraight way many were gathered together, in ſo much as there was no roome to receiue them; no, not ſo much as about the doore, and he preached the Word vnto them.
                           3. And they come vnto him, bringing one ſicke of the Palſie, which was borne of foure:
                           4 And when they could not come nigh him for preaſe, they vncouered the roofe where he was; and when they had broken it vp, they let downe the bed, whereon the ſicke of the Palſi
                                 •
                               lay.
                           5. When Ieſus ſaw their Faith, he ſaid vnto the ſicke of the Palſie, Sonne, thy ſinnes be forgiuen thee.
                        
                     
                     THeſe words and the reſt vnto the 13. verſe, containe the 15. Hiſtory of the firſt yeare of Chriſts publicke Miniſtery, from the firſt Paſſeouer, Ioh. 2.13.
                     The Firſt, was the purging of the Temple; Ioh. 2.14.
                     2. His conference with Nicodemus; Ioh. 3.1.
                     3. The execution of his Miniſtery in Iudea. With Iohns teſtimony of him; Ioh. 3.22.
                     4. A bie Hiſtorie of Iohns Impriſonment; Luke 3.19.
                     5. His conference, with the woman of Samaria; Ioh. 4.1.
                     
                        6. Ieſus hauing left Iudea, and paſſed through Samaria; comes into Galilee, where he heales the Rulers Son, Ioh. 4.43.
                     7. From Galilee hee goes vnto Nazereth; his entertainement there amongſt his countrimen; Luke 4.16.
                     8. Leauing Nazareth, he commeth to Capernaum: with his preaching there; Mat. 4.12. Luke 4.31.
                     9. The calling of his Diſciples.
                     10. The diſpoſſeſſing of a Diuell; Mark. 1.23.
                     11. The curing of Simons wiues mother; Mark. 1.29.
                     12. The curing of many together; Mark. 1.32.
                     13. Chriſt his peragration of Galilee; Mark. 1.39.
                     14. The curing of the Leaper; Mark. 1.40.
                     15. This preſent Hiſtory, which as it is the 15. Hiſtory: ſo it is the ſeuenth miracle recorded.
                     The firſt miracle, was the turning of water into wine at Cana in Galilee; Ioh. 2.1.
                     2. The curing of the Rulers Sonne; Ioh. 4.43.
                     3. The great draught of Fiſhes; Luk. 5.1.
                     4. The diſpoſſeſſing of the Diuell: Mark. 1.23.
                     5. Curing of Simons wiues mother; Mark. 1.29.
                     6. Curing of the Leaper. Mark. 1.40.
                     7. This Matthew chap. 9.2. Recordeth this Hiſtorie after certaine others: and therefore ſome thinke that this and the Story there mentioned, are two diuers Hiſtories; but ſuch is the agreement in the circumſtances, as alſo for as much as it is likewiſe ſet downe before Matthew his calling to be a Diſciple, that it ſeemeth to be the ſame with this. [The firſt verſe, of the ninth chapter; is to be ioyned to the ninth.]
                     The parts of this Hiſtory are; Firſt, Chriſts preparation. Secondly, the manner of working it. Thirdly, the effects.
                     The preparation hereunto in generall, is Chriſt his preaching of the Word: He preached, ſaith Mark. He taught ſaith Luke cap. 5.17. that is, by preaching he taught them. This is ſet forth by diuers circumſtances, wherof Marke ſets downe. Firſt, the time, after ſome dayes. Secondly, the place in generall, Capernaum, is particular the houſe. Thirdly, the occaſion, the multitude comming together. Luke addes a more

particular deſcription of the perſons that came to heare Chriſt, c
                           •
                        p. 4. verſe, 17. Secondly, the ſeale of Chriſts Miniſterie; the Power of God, &amp;c. eodem verſ.
                     Of Chriſts Miniſtery hath beene ſpoken before, now come we to the Time.
                     
                     It is noted here indefinitely to haue beene after ſome daies; viz. which he had ſpent in the deſert; Marke 1. and the laſt verſe Luke 4.16. Either in meditation with his Heauenly Father and prayer to him, or in conference with his Diſciples, or other ſpeciall Friends: hauing thus for a while retired himſelfe, hee now returneth to his publike Miniſtery.
                     
                        Doct. Men of publike function hauing occaſion to retire themſelues for a time, from the place of their calling, for recreation, recouery of health, or through perſecution, &amp;c. muſt haue a minde and care to returne againe to their calling, as ſone as they can. So Eliah withdrawing himſelfe for feare of Iezabell, is commanded from God, to returne againe; 1. King. 19. So Peter lodging priuately at Ioppa; Act. 9. laſt: is ſent for to come abroad by an Angell; Act. 10.
                     For our Function, is that maine worke that we alwaies intend; and therefore our retiring ought to bee for our helpe and not hinderance in the execution of it.
                     
                        Vſe. Is for Miniſters, that they haue a care to returne to their Flocke; as Dauid 1. Sam. 17.15. For it is their charge; Act. 20.28. 1. Pet. 5.2. Secondly, there is in their abſence great danger of falling backe, and growing cold in zeale. The Diuell hauing an entrance to ſow tares, and to bring in many miſchiefes; Act. 20.29. as the Apoſtle Paul found by experience.
                     
                        Place, is noted in generall to bee Capernaum; of which Citie hath beene ſpoken before. Here note, that this is the fourth time where expreſſe mention is made of Chriſt coming vnto this City.
                     So that this was the chiefeſt place of his abode: and therefore it is called his owne Cittie; Mat. 9.1. In regard of which reſidence of Chriſt here, &amp; his often preaching, it was that this

Citie, was lift vp vnto Heauen; in reſpect of the benefit they might haue reaped by his ſtill being with them.
                     
                        Doct. It is a great benefit to haue a faithfull Miniſter, or neighbour dwelling by vs. This the Shunamite well knew; 2. King. 4.9.10. Becauſe of Gods bleſſings accompanying ſuch. Secondly, of greater meanes of comfort and inſtruction. Thirdly, wee are after a more ſpeciall manner partakers of their prayers; for ſuch will not forget to pray for their Friends and Neighbours, and ſuch as they are bound vnto. Which comdemnes the world, that of all other, are loth to haue a Miniſter, or a godly man dwell by them; for feare leſt their prophaneneſſe be diſcouraged. And we ſee that the Capernaites light eſteeme of Chriſt, his dwelling and paines taking amongſt them; was it for which Chriſt doth afterwards condemne them to hel, though before lifted them vp to heauen.
                     The particular place noted, is the Houſe; viz. of Chriſts vſuall abode. For he dwelt in Capernaum; Matth. 4.13. &amp; 9.1. Not of his owne inheritance, for hee had not a houſe of his owne, to hide his head in; Matth. 8.20. But it is like to bee that of Simons and Andrew, mentioned before; chap. 1.29.33. For theſe were likelieſt to entertaine him: and hither the people reſorted once afore verſe 33. and ſo found him out the eaſier now; and Matth. 17.27. Peter payeth tribute for Chriſt and himſelfe, as if they had dwelt both together.
                     Here we ſee that Chriſt lets ſlip no opportunitie, but preacheth in a priuate houſe, hauing good occaſion: which albeit he and other extraordinary perſons, did vpon extraordinary times and occaſions; yet we muſt take heed how wee draw it into imitation, in a ſettled Church where the libertie of publike aſſemblies is permitted to all, to the offence of the ciuill Magiſtrates. Much leſſe may we with Browniſts and Separatiſts, with draw our ſelues from the publike aſſemblies to goe into Woods, &amp;c.
                     The Occaſion in generall, was the peoples concourſe; where note firſt what moued the people to come. It is ſaid that his comming was noiſed abroad; the rumour ſpreading from one Neighbour, to another. This is to bee noted for ſuch places

(as many in the countrey are) where the preaching of the Word is rare; that if happily a faithfull Miniſter comming that way, be willing th
                           •
                        re to beſtow his paines; one Neighbour doe make it knowne to another, and incourage them to come.
                     2. Note their readineſſe, expreſſed two waies. Firſt, their ſpeedineſſe [ſtraight way,] which condemneth the ſlackeneſſe of many in comming to the Church. Secondly, by their Multitude, [many,] amplified by that, that Firſt, the Houſe; Secondly, no not the Porch and places about the houſe were able to receiue them. Amongſt which multitude, though ſome came for curioſitie, ſome for helpe of their diſeaſe, ſome for other reſpects, yet ſome came to heare, and in generall, their comming was commendable, and to good effect; occaſioning Chriſt to inſtruct them.
                     
                        Doct. Readineſſe in people to heare, ought to ſtirre vp in Miniſters a deſire to preach; as Act. 10.33. For this is a ſigne that God will giue a bleſſing; Secondly, that hee hath called vs to ſuch a place.
                     The perſons that were Auditors, are diſcribed by Luke, to haue beene not only of the common ſort: but alſo of the Phariſes and Doctors of the Law.
                     The Phariſes were a ſtrict Sect, differing from all other people, in apparrell, diet, and conuerſation. But two things eſpecially are noted of them. Firſt, that they were moſt exact expoſitors of the Law. Secondly, their ſtrictneſſe of their conuerſation; in both which reſpects, Chriſt doth notably diſcouer their falſe dealings, ſhewing them to be, both hereticall in their Doctrine, grounding their expoſitions not on the Scriptures, but the traditions of their Fathers: and alſo hypocriticall in their converſation, doing whatſoeuer they doe, to be ſeene of men.
                     The Doctors of the Law, are thoſe that be called elſewhere Scribes, not from writing, but learning. For both Scribes and Phariſes, ſate in Moſes Chaire, though theſe were a more common kinde of teachers then the Phariſes.
                     Both theſe ſorts were in oppoſition againſt Chriſt, malicing

and hating him. And now they came with a malicious, enuious, and captious minde to enſnare him: as may appeare by their reaſoning againſt him in their hearts. Yet it is ſaid, theſe men came from euery quarter round about, to ſhew how farre malice and enuie will carry men, further ordinarily then pittie. Secondly, note here that Chriſt ceaſeth not to preach, although theſe captious and enuious hearers ſate before his face: being he knew that his Doctrine was true, and that hee was able to defend it. Now there was neuer any congregation, where were not ſome enuious, captious, and malicious hearers; who comming not with a minde to ſubiect themſelues, to the Word, finde occaſion to cauill and carpe at it, to bleare mens eyes with this pretence, as a cauſe why they doe not yeeld obedience vnto it. For all this Miniſters muſt not be diſcouraged from preaching, but regard: Firſt, that the Lord hath ſent them. Secondly, The Talent that God hath beſtowed vpon them, which they muſt imploy, if the Lord himſelfe hinder them not. Thirdly, that there be ſome honeſt hearted hearers, and their good is to be reſpected. Such kinde of Auditors had Ieremie, chap. 20.10. ſee Ezek. 2.3. &amp;c.
                     As an antidote againſt the poyſon of enuious tongues, Miniſters ought to regard both the matter and manner of their Doctrine, that it be ſuch as may be iuſtified by the Word of God, that it be ſo deliuered plainely, powerfully, that it ſauour not of oſtentation, and affectation.
                     The Seale of Chriſts preaching, is the extraordinary Power of God, that is, the gift of healing; which did now manifeſt it ſelfe in an extraordinary manner. That it is called the power of the Lord, inferre no oppoſition, ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe was the Lord. Or ſecondly, rather becauſe that Chriſt in regard of that condition, whereunto he did ſubiect himſelfe, in taking our nature and infirmities vpon him; he needed the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God. Not that this power of the Spirit was not alwaies in him, but becauſe it did not alike alwaies ſhew it ſelfe, as Marke 6.5. himſelfe reſtraining it in regard of the condition on mens part, viz. Faith.
                     At this time he doth manifeſt this diuine Power, the rat

                        er

becauſe of his malitious aduerſaries that were there preſent· So that it is to be noted, that the more the Word is cauilled at, the more euidence God giueth thereunto. Moſes miracles the more the Sorcerers did diſgrace, the more clearer they were, till they did confeſſe the finger of God, Exod. See Act. 4.16. Which ſerues to incourage honeſt hearers, and to confound the aduerſaries.
                     The ſecond general part is the Miracle it ſelfe, and the working of it, wherein note, firſt, the kind of the diſeaſe: ſecondly, the occaſion: thirdly, the manner of curing.
                     Touching the kind of the diſeaſe, it was the Palſie: a diſeaſe whereby the nerues and ſinewes are ſo looſed and diſſolued, that motion and life is loſt in that part which is ſo affected; and therefore it is called the dead Palſie, which if it bee ſomewhat growne, it is hardly or neuer cured; as it was with this man, who was neither able to goe, nor to ſit, which ſhewes the greatneſſe of the cure. Now though this diſeaſe be a ſhame to Phiſitians paſſing their skill, yet Chriſt did cure it, as he is able to doe all other the moſt dangerous ſickneſſes.
                     The occaſion of working this Miracle, was partly the Faith of them that brought him, partly the Faith of himſelfe, verſ. 5. which Faith, though it be an inward grace, and ſo of mans eyes inuiſible, yet Chriſt could ſee it inwardly. Notwithſtanding, here he ſees it alſo by the fruites thereof in them by their charity, diligence and labour in bringing this poore man to Chriſt. Secondly, in the man himſelfe by his great patience, in ſuffering all thoſe things they did vnto him. Of theſe wee will ſpeake of more particularly; and firſt, of the fruits of faith in this mans Friends.
                     Their charity and care is ſet downe in fiue branches; firſt, that they did not onely tell him of a remedy for his diſeaſe, but alſo did foure of them bring him vnto the place where it was to be had, verſ. 3.
                     2. That he being not able to riſe and goe along with them▪ they carry him, and not ſo onely, but for his greater eaſe, bed and all, verſ. 3.
                     3. Hauing brought him, they leaue him not ſo, letting him

alone for others to bring him to Ieſus, but themſelues ſeeke all meanes to come neere vnto Chriſt, verſ. 4. Luk. 5.17.
                     4. When in ſeeking of this meanes of acceſſe, they were hindred, yet doe they not ceaſe to proceede on, not making this hinderance an excuſe either for to leaue him, or to carry him backe againe.
                     5. Finding no ordinary meanes, they ſeeke vnto extraordinary: firſt, they clime vp to the top of the houſe, and ſo draw vp the bed. Now it is to be noted, that their houſes were flat on the top, as may be gathered out of Deut. 22.8. and that this houſe here ſpoken of, was open to the top without chambers, like a great Hall, and ſo it was fit for a great many to come together. Secondly, they vncouer the roofe, and breake it open. Thirdly, when they could not goe downe themſelues, they let him downe with ropes.
                     From theſe circumſtances we learne many duties of charity to be performed in like caſes of diſtreſſe.
                     1. That it is not ſufficient to tell our friends of the meanes of cure, but wee muſt doe our beſt to make them partakers of ſuch meanes. For ſome are vnable to helpe themſelues, as this man; and ſome are careleſſe of their owne ſafety, like Naaman, 2. King. 5, 12. and ſome it bootes but little, only to tell them of the meanes, vnleſſe we help them to it our ſelues, and perſwade them to vſe it, like to Naamans ſeruants. To apply this to ſpirituall cures, wee muſt not onely make knowne vnto others where the meanes of ſaluation is to be had, but alſo as farre as in vs lyeth, make them partakers of it. For here the reaſon holds true, that we are vnable, careleſſe, and vnwilling to ſeeke vnto theſe meanes of our ſelues. This belongs to thoſe that are ſet ouer others, as Maſters their Seruants, Magiſtrates their Subiects, and Miniſters alſo their people, to cauſe them to come vnto the miniſtery of the Word.
                     2. That we tender thoſe that are weake, according to their weakeneſſe, ſupplying their wants; and therefore did theſe men bring the bed alſo. So did Iob relieue euery one according to his want, Chap. 29.15. Gal. 6.2. Epheſ. 4.2.
                     Note here a contrary practice of a cruel wretch, namely, Saul,
                        
who when Dauid would not ſpare him, but would haue him brought, bed and all, to be ſlaine: 1. Sam. 19.13. ſo that the charity of mercifull men cannot goe ſo farre, but the cruelty of wretches will goe as farre, or further.
                     3. That in good actions and indeauours which wee goe about, wee ſuffer not obſtacles to hinder our proceeding. For no actions are without ſome: yea, God doth many times miniſter ſome for the triall of our faith and conſtancy, as Matth. 15.
                           ••
                        . &amp;c. The diuell alſo through malice doth lay many blockes in our wayes, as 1. Theſ. 2.18. And this is the rather to be noted, becauſe of our proneneſſe to make excuſes, eſpecially in ſpirituall matters, wherein wee are like the ſluggard in the Prouerbs, ſtill doubting of ſome danger. Herein Heſter, though otherwiſe a good woman, failed, fearing the Kings Edict: Heſt. 4.11. but Mordecay told her, that this ſcruple muſt not hinder her in ſo good a purpoſe, as the ſafety of the Iewes, verſ. 13.14.
                     4. When by ordinary meanes we cannot effect our deſire, then are we to vſe extraordinary, as Dauid did; 1. Sam. 21, 4, 6. whoſe example Chriſt doth alleage, Matth. 12.34. So where the Word is not preached in our Pariſhes, we may come to others. Alwaies prouided, that though the meanes bee vnuſuall, yet they be lawfull. Wherein Rebecca failed, in procuring her ſonne a bleſſing, by teaching him to lye.
                     Now for a generall vſe of all, if we compare our backwardneſſe, in ſeeking the ſpirituall good of our friend with the care of theſe, in ſeeking the temporall good of this man, wee cannot but be aſhamed. Surely ſeeing there is a greater neceſſity of this ſpirituall care, then of the bodily, and that in ſeeking of this, we are more acceptable vnto Chriſt, then in the other, we ought to be ſtirred vp with greater care to tender the good of our brethrens ſoules.
                     Secondly, we are to conſider the fruites of Faith, which are in this man the patient. His patience is ſet forth; firſt, that he ſuffered himſelfe to be brought out of his houſe, which a ſicke man eaſily doth not, to bee carried among the preſſe, to bee drawne vp, and to bee let downe; all which could not but

worke great diſquiet vnto him: yet doth hee not repine, and ſay, If you were in my caſe, you would not bee thus and thus tumbled vp and downe. But ſeeing that his friends deſired his good, he willingly ſubmits himſelfe to them.
                     From whence wee may learne, how to carry our ſelues in time of ſickneſſe, to bee patient, to yeeld to our friends aduice, conſidering that they do it for our good, and alſo better vnderſtand what is fit for vs, then our ſelues. Now then how patiently ought we to ſubmit our ſelues to thoſe, that ſeeke our good and conuerſion, though it be with ſome trouble to vs in our conſcience.
                     Wee come now to conſider their Faith, the ground of all theſe workes, expreſſed here, verſ. 5. and Luk. 5.20. [When hee ſaw their Faith.] Wherein three words are to be noted; Saw. Their. Faith.
                     
                     
                        Doct. Faith makes all other workes to bee acceptable to Chriſt. He regarded not thoſe outward things theſe men did, but he ſaw their faith in them. The whole Chapter of the eleuenth to the Hebrewes, prooues, and eſpecially verſ. 6. For Faith is the roote of all ſanctifying graces: by it we are vnited vnto Chriſt, in whom being rooted and ingrafted, wee receiue from him life and grace, which ſhewes it ſelfe forth in vs by the fruites, as a tree receiuing ſap from the roote, ſends it forth into fruit: ſo that what comes not from Faith, hath no ſpirituall life in it, the roote whereby it is receiued, being wanting.
                     2. Faith is the hand whereby we receiue the gifts of God; as Ioh. 1.12. where receiuing and beleeuing are all one.
                     3. Of all other graces, God by Faith is moſt glorified: for by it alone we come vtterly to deny our ſelues, and to attribute all to the goodneſſe and grace of God. This ſhewes how farre the world is deceiued; firſt, Gentiles and Heathens that know not God, and ſo no good thing they doe can bee acceptable to him. Secondly, Papiſts, that thinke by workes to merit Gods fauour, which conceit doth indeed breed ſpirituall pride in mans heart making him moſt odious in Gods ſight.
                     3. Ignorant men that thinke their good meaning and intent makes the thing acceptable before God. Let vs then labour

for Faith in all our wo
                           •
                        kes, doing them, firſt, becauſe God hath commanded them: Secondly, in deniall of our ſelues, relying on Gods goodneſſe in Chriſt, to haue both them and our perſons accepted.
                     
                        Saw.] Chriſt ſaw their faith by his diuine power: but here eſpecially by thoſe great fruits whereby it appeared.
                     
                        Doct. The Faith which is acceptable to Chriſt, is a viſible Faith, which manifeſteth it ſelfe by the fruits, ſuch was the faith of thoſe Worthies, Heb. 11. appearing by ſome notable marke or other: Iam. 2.18. For Faith if it receiue ſap and grace from Chriſt, it will grow and bud forth; it is like fire, it cannot bee hid: and this is a marke diſtinguiſhing true faith from falſe: ſuch as is that of many carnall Goſpellers, who make an outward profeſſion, but their fruits are none, they remaine meere worldly and carnall ſtill.
                     
                        Their.] That is, as the plurall number ſheweth, of the friends of this man: but yet in that hereupon hee turneth his ſpeech vnto the man, and ſaith, Thy ſinnes, &amp;c. it is plaine that by this word Their, is meant the Faith of this ſicke man, as well as of his friends.
                     
                        Doct. The Faith, Prayer, and Charity of men are auaileable before God, not onely for themſelues, but for others alſo. Here then let vs ſee how they are auaileable, how farre not.
                     Firſt, the Faith of one man is auaileable for another, as firſt, the faith of the Parents is a meanes to giue their children a right to the Couenant of God. So are they called holy, 1. Cor. 7.14. becauſe of their beleeuing parents.
                     Secondly, the Faith of one may be a meanes to bring another to repentance and grace. So are our prayers auaileable for the Iewes, as were theirs alſo for the Gentiles in times paſt. So may our prayers profit particular perſons, by mouing God to worke Faith and repentance in them.
                     Thirdly, to obtaine temporall bleſſings: as Laban for Iacobs ſake, Gen. 30.27. Potiphar for Ioſephs ſake was bleſſed, Geneſ. 39.5. and the whole world is bleſſed for the Churches ſake.
                     But it is no way auaileable for the obtaining of eternall life, and enioying the free grace and mercy of God in the remiſſion

of ones ſinne, for this euery man muſt haue Faith of his owne, Hab. 2.4.
                     Hereby we ſee how God doth reſpect the Faith of his children, accepting it not onely for themſelues, but for others alſo. And the vſe for vs, is to vſe this charitable meanes in the behalfe of our brethren, the Lord giuing vs this encouragement to come for others, as well as our ſelues. Wherefore it is a commendable practice of friends to deſire the prayers one of another.
                     Now in that this mans friends did not alone intreate for him, but himſelfe alſo beleeued, ſo that his Faith ioyned with theirs, was effectuall for the curing of his bodily diſeaſe, and alſo the obtaining of remiſſion of ſinnes, we learne, that when the prayers of parties themſelues are ioyned with others, then they are truly effectuall. So the Apoſtle deſires the Romanes to ſtriue with him by prayers to God; Rom. 15.30.
                     
                        Vſe is for reproofe of thoſe that thinke they are ſafe, if others call vpon God for them, though themſelues neuer pray. This is not ſufficient. Abraham prayed for Iſmael, Gen. 17.18. but Iſmael prayed not with him, and therefore they benefited him not, verſ. 21. So did Samuel pray for Saul, 1. Sam. 15.35. but Saul was careleſſe of himſelfe; and therefore God bids Samuel ceaſe praying, Chap. 16.1. So Ezek. 14.14. Wee ought ſo as we deſire to obtaine temporall, or ſpirituall bleſſings by the prayers of others, to ioyne alſo our prayers with theirs.
                     All this while wee heare of no petition, this poore man is brought before Chriſt, and there hee lyes, none ſpake a word for him, nor yet himſelfe for himſelfe. Neuertheleſſe doth Chriſt worke this great miracle on him.
                     Here note, firſt, Chriſt his readineſſe to grant vnto vs the deſires and groanes of our hearts, when he knowes them before that we doe vtter them. Dauid did but thinke to confeſſe, and God forgaue, Pſalm. 32.5. Exod. 14.15. Neh. 2.4. Luk. 15.18, 19, 20.
                     
                        Vſe. For comfort of them, who through feare, griefe, or trouble of minde, are not able to expreſſe their deſire. 2. If God doe accept a deſire, how much more a faithfull prayer.
                     
                        Secondly, in the parties, note by their ſilence, that they thought it ſufficient to make knowne vnto Chriſt this mans caſe, by laying him before him, without preſcribing how, or when to cure him. In like manner muſt we wait patiently on Chriſt, not appointing him the time, place, or meanes of deliuery. So much for the occaſion of this Miracle.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 5.
                           Sonne, [man, Luk. 5.20.] [bee of good cheere, Matth. 9.2.] thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee.
                           6. And there were certaine of the Scribes ſitting there, and reaſoning in their hearts.
                           7. Why doth this man ſpeake ſuch blaſphemy? Who can forgiue ſinnes but God onely.
                           8. And immediately when Ieſus perceiued in his ſpirit, that they thus reaſoned with themſelues, he ſaid vnto them, Why reaſon you theſe things in your hearts?
                           9. Whether it is eaſier to ſay to the ſicke of the Palſie, Thy ſinnes are forgiuen? or to ſay, Ariſe, and take vp thy bed, and walke.
                           10. But that yee may know that the Sonne of man hath authoritie in earth to forgiue ſinnes, he ſaid to the ſicke of the Palſie,
                           11. I ſay vnto thee, Ariſe, and take vp thy bed, and get thee to thine owne houſe.
                        
                     
                     IN theſe words is laid downe the manner of curing this ſicke man: wherein note, firſt, the preparatiue vnto it. Secondly, the cure it ſelfe, Ariſe, take vp.
                     
                     The preparatiue, [thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee, &amp;c.] by reaſon of the cauill of the Scribes is amplified by
                     Firſt, a moſt gratious conſolation.
                     Secondly, a malicious oppoſition againſt the ſame.
                     Thirdly, a iudicial defenſe and apology for his ſaying againſt thoſe Scribes.
                     Firſt, the conſolation: in it obſerue, firſt, a compellation: ſecondly, an exhortation: thirdly, an abſolution.
                     In the compellation note firſt in generall, the admirable gentleneſſe of Chriſt towards this man, that though this was done

in time whileſt he was preaching, &amp; ſo ſeemed to interrupt him: yet ſeeing his ſincere and faithfull heart, he doth not reproue him, but receiueth him, with great kindeneſſe and compaſſion.
                     
                        Doctr. God reiecteth none, that come to him with a faithfull heart. And though he ſeemeth ſo to do Matth. 15.22. yet he doth not indeed reiect her, but for the manifeſtation of her faith, he trieth her, knowing in himſelfe before that, for all his deniall, ſhe would not goe away.
                     
                        
                           Ʋſe Is for incouragement to come to Chriſt.
                     
                        Man] Chriſt taketh notice of his mould and condition, and in that regard doth pittie and ſuccour him. See Pſal. 103.14. And in like may we lay forth our fraile condition as an argument to moue God to pittie.
                     
                        Sonne] a title of fauour and honour.
                     
                        Doct. Chriſt doth account all faithfull men his ſonnes and children. Where Diues in Hell is called Sonne, it is ironically ſpoken, and by way of vpbraiding; Luke 16.25. as the vnworthy gueſt is called Friend; Matth. 22.12. The vſe is Pſal. 103.13.
                     The exhortation is ſet downe by Matthew chap. 9.2. Bee of good cheere. And it is oppoſed to a kinde of feare and doubt, that was in this man; by reaſon of his ſinnes: though he had Faith, yet it was not without doubting; Chriſt therefore knowing his caſe, applies a fit remedie for the ſtrengthning of his faith.
                     
                        Doct. Chriſt doth not reiect a weake faith, which ought to be a great incouragement vnto vs, if ſo be that we can finde in our ſelues any euidence of the beginning of true Grace.
                     The Vſe Is to teach vs how to carry our ſelues towards thoſe that are ſicke, to applie remedies according to their wants; eſpecially, if they be afflicted in minde, then to yeeld vnto them all the comforts we can; Prou. 18.14.
                     The third part of Conſolation is the Abſolution, where we may note that Aſſurance of the remiſſion of ſinnes is a moſt ſoueraigne ground of comfort.
                     For our ſinnes being forgiuen, all things turne to our Good. It being ſinnes alone, that makes vs miſerable. Secondly, obſerue

the difference of Chriſt his manner of pronouncing abſolution of ſinnes from that both of extraordinary Miniſters; as Prophets, and Apoſtles, and of ordinary Miniſters, ss alſo of Priuate Chriſtians.
                     Chriſt being God and Man, the Mediator of Mankinde, hath purchaſed by his death remiſſion of ſinnes: ſo that hee can pronounce abſolution of them, in his owne Name, and not only pronounce it, but alſo actually giue remiſſion of ſinnes.
                     Prophets and Apoſtles did pronounce it in Chriſts Name, &amp;c. thhat conditionally, vpon condition of faith and repentance, alſo they could by inſpiration, know whether a mans ſinnes were forgiuen or not.
                     Ordinary Miniſters, are Gods Embaſſadors; and in Chriſts ſtead, by vertue of this Office and Function, in which they are placed for the comfort of diſtreſſed ſoules; vnto whom, vpon condition of faith and repentance, they may pronounce abſolution.
                     Priuate Chriſtians can doe no more, but tell their brethren of the promiſes of God, and comfort them with the conſolations of the Scripture, but to pronounce abſolution of ſinnes, is not in their, but the Miniſters authoritie, and commiſſion.
                     3. We may here note, how Chriſt ſhewes himſelfe to be a faithfull Phyſition, in that he ſtrikes at the roote, and firſt takes away the cauſe of the diſeaſe, viz. his ſinnes. The like courſe is to be vſed with ſicke perſons, to labour firſt to bring them to a ſight of their ſinnes, and repentance for them, and ſo to apply remedies for their diſeaſes.
                     4. Chriſt obſeruing the faith of this man, doth preſently pronounce remiſſion of ſinnes. Where note that remiſſion of ſinnes ariſeth from the free mercy of God, without any workes.
                     5. The mans friends came only for the curing of his bodily diſeaſe, and Chriſt beſtowes on him a greater benefit, hee forgiues him his ſinnes. Hence wee learne that Chriſt doth giue greater and better things to thoſe that come to him in Faith, then themſelues doe deſire. So Iacob deſired but food and apparrell,

and God gaue him great riches. See Pſal. 21.4. Ephe. 3.20. For God hath an eye to his owne bountie, and what it becomes him to giue, and more reſpects our neede, then our requeſt: and therefore ſometimes denies our requeſt, granti
                           •
                        g vs a greater benefit another way, as to Paul.
                     
                     In the Oppoſition made againſt this ſpeach of Chriſt, beginning at the 6. verſe, let vs as in the former part of this ſtory, conſider the differences that are betweene the Euangeliſts, in ſetting of it downe; and firſt in addition.

                     2. In varietie of phraſes. As Matthew ſaith; [they ſaid.] Marke, they reaſoned in their hearts. Luke, they beganne to thinke or reaſon.
                     In this oppoſition we may note theſe parts.
                     
                        1. The parties oppoſing; Scribes and Phariſes.
                        2. The manner of their oppoſition; in their hearts.
                        3. The matter they oppoſe; Blaſphemie.
                        4. The ground and reaſon of it; who can forgiue ſinnes &amp;c.
                     
                     Parties oppoſing weare Scribes and Phariſes, of whom we heard before that they were accounted learned expoſitors of the Law. Whence we obſerue, that learning not ſanctified, makes men to bee the greater enemies to the Truth, of God. The people wee ſee did glorifie God, it was the Scribes and Phariſes, that cauilled againſt Chriſt preaching. So Ier. 26.11. Heretikes haue beene alwaies learned men. And among Papiſts,

the Ieſuites are moſt learned.
                     For learning ſeparated from grace, puffeth vp, and maketh men ſelfe-conceited. So that they ſet all their wit and learning to diſgrace, and defame others.
                     
                        Vſe Is for Schollers, to pray God to Sanctifie their learning, vnto them. Alſo that the people, who from the vniuerſities, doe receiue Miniſters; doe pray for them, that God would ſanctifie and ſeaſon their learning with his Grace.
                     
                        Manner of oppoſing was that this conceit was but yet in their hearts, they vttered it not, they did not fret, fume, and depart away, diſdaining to heare ſuch blaſphemie, but they ſit ſtill, and carry a ſmooth face, minding to watch their opportunitie afterwards.
                     Hypocrites do then deuiſe greateſt miſchiefe in their hearts, when they carry faireſt faces. Ezek. 14.1, 3. &amp; chap. 33.31. Iudas carried ſo fare a face, that none of the Diſciples ſuſpected him of treacherie, euery one was more affraid of himſelfe; Matth. 26.22.25.
                     
                        Vſe To teach vs to bee wiſe as Serpents, not to truſt men vpon ſhew and outward appearance, when they come to heare the Word, and are attentiue vnto it. Chriſt did it not. Ioh. 2.24. For he ſaw that they had hollow hearts. Act. 9.26.
                     The matter they lay to his charge is Blaſphemie; now to Blaſpheme, is to impeach the name and credit of any: and is attributed to man. 1. Cor. 4.13. Iud. verſe 8.
                     But the common vſe hath more principally attributed it to God: and ſo it is taken in double reſpect. Firſt, when ſomethings derogatorie to the diuine Maieſtie, is attributed to him: and then ſome word is added, as blaſphemes God, the Name of God, &amp;c. Reue. 16.9.11. Secondly, when ſome thing proper to God is attributed to man, and then it is ſaid ſimply, he blaſphemed; Matth. 26.65. This ſinne was puniſhable by death. This great offence they lay to his charge, the more to bring him in danger, and ſee how they aggrauate it as appeares by their diuers queſtions, ſet downe by the Euangeliſts.
                     
                        Doct. Malice doth make men aggrauate euery thing to the vtmoſt, as Korah. Numb. 16.3. the Princes conſpiring againſt

                        Daniel Dan. 6.13. and Haman. Eſt. 3.8. Tertullus Acts 24.5.6.
                     
                        Vſe. To teach vs that if we liue among malicious men, wee carry our ſelues wiſely, and warily, ſo that wee may iuſtifie whatſoeuer we doe.
                     
                        Ground and reaſon of their oppoſition, is in theſe words, [who can forgiue ſinnes, but God only. Where firſt in generall note, that nothing can be ſo comfortably ſpoken, but malicious enemies will peruert it to the contrary. Chriſt comforted this man, by pronouncing forgiueneſſe of ſinnes to him; they impute this to Chriſt, as a matter of blaſphemie: becauſe there is ſuch men, a ſatanicall ſpirit, which like poyſon, turneth the ſweeteſt things into venome.
                     More particularly in the reaſon of this their Cauill, we may ſee that the ground is true and good, but their fault is in the application. It is true.
                     1. That, that which properly belongeth to God, cannot be attributed to man.
                     2. That forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, is proper to God.
                     3. That man, cannot forgiue ſinnes.
                     4. That Chriſt in taking this power to him, tooke that which belonged to God. All theſe, the reaſon truly implies. Yet neuertheleſſe, the concluſion which they draw from hence that Chriſt Blaſphemeth, is falſe, and blaſphemous.
                     In which points, our aduerſaries the Papiſts, goe beyond theſe Phariſes, who attribute the power of binding the conſcience proper only to God, to mans alſo; who beſides Chriſt, giues vnto the Pope, and other, power to forgiue ſinnes and the like.
                     In this reaſoning of the Scribes and Phariſes, we may note two faultes of them. Firſt, that without further inquiring they did raſhly accuſe Chriſt of Blaſphemie, vpon that ſpeech; they might haue interpreted it as ſpoken prophetically. Secondly, in that they did not ſee that he had power and authoritie, to doe that which he did. They did wilfully winke at all thoſe euidences, and teſtimonies of his diuine power, which were manifeſted among them, and were eſpecially knowne to

ſuch learned men as they, the ſignes of his birth; his diſputing with them, his miracles and the like; by which many others were conuerted. And therefore Chriſt bids them take heed, leſt they ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, by denying ſo plaine a truth.
                     So that we ſee that theſe Scribes and Phariſes, thinking to accuſe Chriſt of Blaſphemie, doe themſelues Blaſpheme, in denying vnto God that which doth belong vnto him; viz. power to forgiue ſinnes.
                     
                        Doct. Slanderous accuſers of Innocents, are guiltie themſelues of the ſame crime, which they lay to their charge; Mat. 26.65. which is brought to paſſe by the ſeuere Iudgement of God, that they may be found out in their owne wickedneſſe, and be made the more inexcuſable.
                     So dealt the Papiſts in accuſing our Doctrine, as a Doctrine of libertie, when none is more licentious, then their owne, &amp;c.
                     
                        Doct. Secondly, from their falſe conſequence, we may obſerue the Diuels Logicke, teaching men from true grounds to gather falſe concluſions; that by the truth of the ground, mens eyes may bee bleared: as Heretikes, and Idolaters, alwaies haue done; alleadging Scripture alwaies for their aſſertions.
                     
                        Vſe, Is not therefore to diſlike the Scripture, accounting it with the Papiſts a leaden rule; but to trie the conſequences drawne from thence, and to labour that on this foundation we build Gold, not Stubble, Hay, and Straw. So much for the Oppoſition.
                     Wee are now come to Chriſt his Apologie, where before wee handle the Defence; wee haue to conſider how Chriſt knew of this their Cauilling.
                     
                        Luke ſaith he knew their thoughts.
                     
                        Matthew, that he ſaw them, which is more then knowing; for that he might haue done by ſome outward ſigne.
                     
                        Marke, that immediately as ſoone as they began to thinke, Ieſus perceiued in his Spirit.
                     
                        Doct. Chriſt knowes the very ſecrets of mens hearts, bee they enemies or friends; as of his Diſ
                           •
                        iples; Luke 9.47.
                     
                        The Reaſon is here added by Marke, hee perceiued their thoughts in his Spirit, by his Diuine Power and Godhead; 1. King. 8.39. Act. 1.24. And herein is the difference betweene Chriſt and the Prophets, who knew many times the thoughts of men, but it was by reuelation, and inſpiration; 2. King. 4.27.
                     This was another euidence againſt the Scribes and Phariſes to conuince them, that the thoughts of their hearts, ſhould thus be knowne to Chriſt, no man telling him of them.
                     
                        Vſe, Firſt, for inſtruction, to haue a ſpeciall regard of our hearts, when we come before Chriſt.
                     Secondly, for Conſolation in regard of enemies, that whatſoeuer they imagine againſt the Church, ſhall not hurt vs, ſeeing Chriſt knoweth all their deuices, and will preuent them; 2. King. 6.12.
                     Secondly, in regard of our ſelues, that though men ouerlooke vs, and regard not that ſeruice which wee performe to God; yea, nickename vs for it: yet Chriſt which knoweth the heart willl reward vs. See Matth. 6.6.
                     In the Apologie is firſt a reproofe; Chriſt reprooues them: Why reaſon ye theſe euill things in your hearts? So that malicious ſlanderers are to haue their faults plainely reproued. Pſal. 50.21.
                     Secondly, the Defence it ſelfe, where firſt, note in generall, in as much as Chriſt ſtands to that he hath deliuered, it being a truth, and denies it not, though his enemies had raiſed a ſlander vpon it; that, Truth is not to be denied for the cauilling of men, and their oppoſition againſt it; Gal. 2.5. wherein Peter halted verſe 11.12.
                     Becauſe Gods Truth is more pretious then Pearles, and no part of it is to be loſt.
                     Secondly, In ſhrinking from the truth, we feare man more then God.
                     Thirdly, wee giue aduantage to the aduerſarie, and make him bold; and alſo we diſcourage the weake brethren.
                     Secondly, In particular we ſee that the Phariſes and Scribes, oppoſed againſt him, that he had taken too much vpon him,

namely, a propertie of God to forgiue ſinnes. Chriſt denieth not that hee had taken this vnto him, but ſaith hee tooke no more vpon him, then hee had right and authoritie to doe; namely, to forgiue ſinnes in his owne Name: and that he hath this authoritie in a thing inuiſible, hee proueth by a viſible effect of his Diuine Power. The Phariſes reaſoned thus: He that is man and not God, cannot forgiue ſinnes. Chriſt is man, and not God: therefore Chriſt cannot forgiue ſinnes. Chriſt to the contrary proueth that he is God, and not man only; in that by his bare Word, hee could cure a man deſperately ſicke: wherefore being God, hee tooke vpon him no more then lawfully he might.
                     The Argument ſtandeth thus: Hee that hath an abſolute power ouer diſeaſes, he hath authoritie to forgiue ſinnes. But I, ſaith Chriſt, haue an abſolute command ouer diſeaſes: therefore I haue authoritie to forgiue ſinnnes.
                     The Propoſition, is laid downe verſe 9. where both theſe effects, viz. forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and curing of a bodily diſeaſe, are compared together, and ſhewed to be of like hardneſſe and eaſineſſe, that it is of like power and authoritie, to doe the one, as the other; wherefore if they could not deny this outward viſible effect to be wrought by a Diuine Power, neither could they doubt of the other, though inuiſible. And for a further ſtrengthning of the argument, it is laid downe Interrogatiuely, Chriſt referring it euen to his aduerſaries, to be Iudges, whether it were not ſo or no.
                     
                        Obiect. But here a queſtion will be mooued, whether the curing of a bodily diſeaſe, and the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, bee equall; one as hard and as eaſie as the other: for as much as it ſeemeth that ſinnes of the ſoule are more hardly cured, then diſeaſes of the body.
                     
                        Anſw. Firſt, theſe are compared not one with another, but in regard of humane power, becauſe both are aboue humane ſtraine; and neither can be done without diuine power. Secondly. Being compared with the Power of God, they are both alike; for in reſpect thereof, there is no difference of eaſineſſe or hardneſſe; 1. Sam. 14.6. 2. Chron. 14.11. Thirdly,

this is ſaid in regard of their earthly conceit and dull vnderſtanding. For that a man but now ſo deſperately ſicke, ſhould on a ſudden be perfectly cured; this in their conceite ſeemed the greater worke. Fourthly, Sickneſſe is a fruite of ſinne, and he that can remooue the effect, can as eaſily remooue the cauſe.
                     
                        To ſay,] that is, ſo powerfully and effectually, to ſay that the thing ſhall be done.
                     
                        Doctr. Outward viſible things obiected to our ſences, are great meanes to helpe our vnderſtanding, in conceiuing of things inuiſible, and to ſtrengthen our Faith in beleeuing of them; Rom. 1.28. Pſal. 19.1.
                     For this end did Chriſt worke all his miracles, that in them we might ſee him to bee an Alm
                           •
                        ghtie Sauiour, to cure all the diſeaſes of our ſoules, to looſe all the workes of the Diuell, and to ſaue vs from death, and him that had the power thereof. This collection is plainely expreſſed by Matth
                              •
                           w, chap. 8.17.
                     For earthly we are, and beſt vnderſtand earthly things, by comparing whereof with ſpirituall things, wee come by little and little to vnderſtand them; Ioh. 3.12. and for this cauſe did God in former times giue ſignes vnto his people, his Seruants and Prophets; as to Moſes, Gedeon, &amp;c.
                     
                     
                        Vſe, Is for vs to helpe our ſelues by theſe outward meanes. Doe we doubt of Gods Prouidence, to conſider the making and preſeruation of all things; of the Reſurrection, that which the Apoſtle ſaith; 2. Cor. 15.36. of the manner how wee are fed by Chriſt, and how our ſinnes are waſhed away by his blood, to conſider thoſe things which are ſet forth vnto vs in the Sacrament, &amp;c.
                     Next followes the Application of this argument, which is laid downe by Inuerſion. The aſſumption. viz. [But I haue an abſolute command ouer diſeaſes] is laid downe verſ. 11. by an euident proofe of a deede done. The concluſion is verſ. 10. by an infallible inference from the reſt, viz. That ye might know, that the Sonne of Man, hath Power to forgiue ſinnes on Earth.
                     
                        We will handle them in order, as the Holy Ghoſt hath ſet them downe. In them we may obſerue the manner of curing this man; and firſt the end why. Secondly, The meanes how hee was cured: viz. the imperiall charge and command of Chriſt.
                     The end was that they might know hee had power to forgiue ſinnes.
                     
                        Doctr. Chriſt had a further end in his micacles, then a bodily good vnto thoſe that were cured. A higher myſterie is contained in them, namely that in curing of our bodies hee might ſhew himſelfe the Sauiour of our Soules, &amp;c. as is declared before.
                     
                        Vſe, Is that we read not theſe miracles as bare hiſtoricall narrations, but that we conſider in them the Almightie power of Chriſt: otherwiſe we miſſe of the fruite and benefit of them, for the ſtrengthening of our Faith in him.
                     More particularly in this End conſider we foure points.
                     
                        1. Whoſe good and inſtruction it was he aimeth at.
                        2. The title that he giueth himſelfe.
                        3. The ground whereupon he doth this worke.
                        4. The Place.
                     
                     1. Chriſt labours to inſtruct thoſe that are contrary minded, his aduerſaries the Scribes and Phariſes that cauilled at his Preaching. He might haue reſted himſelfe in the approbation of his Heauenly Father, the teſtimonie of his owne conſcience, the witneſſe of his Diſciples that his Word and Doctrine was true, and in that former proofe of Diuine power which hee had giuen them, in diſcouering vnto them the thoughts of their hearts: neuertheleſſe ſeeing them thorow blindneſſe, and malice, not yet throughly inſtructed, hee labours by further proofe to ſhow them their error, and to bring them to knowledge of the truth. Thus he deales with them againe; Marke 3.22. &amp;c. Conuincing them of error by many arguments: and generally wee may obſerue of Chriſt, that neither the dulneſſe of his hearers, their impious ſcoffing, nor their ſlanderous cauilling, did hinder him from ſtriuing to inſtruct them further; as Nicodemus his dulneſſe. The ſcoffe

of the woman of Samaria; Ioh. 4.11. wherein Chriſt followed his Father; Eſay, 63.2. and the Apoſtle the example of Chriſt, in labouring to giue vnto Iewes and Gentiles, vnderſtanding and knowledge of thoſe things, which they ſo much oppoſed againſt; and in this all Miniſters ſhould follow their example. 2. Tim. 2.25. where the reaſon of it is alſo ſet downe, If thoſe places be obiected; Act. 18.6. &amp; 19.9. Tit. 3.10. and that therefore thoſe that are peruerſe, may bee preſently giuen ouer: thoſe places ſhew rather the contrary, for by them we ſee that the Apoſtles did labour firſt to inſtruct them, and left them not, till they ſaw them obſtinate.
                     2. The title is, Sonne of man: which is in Scripture taken ſometime generally, and indefinitely for all the ſons of Adam, mankinde, as Iob 25.6. and ſometime for man corrupt, in his corrupt eſtate, as 1. Sam. 26.19. Gen. 6.2. Pſal.
                     
                     More particularly it is giuen to the Prophets, and eſpecially to Ezekiel, more then to any of the reſt, to put him in minde of his infirmitie, that he ſhould not be proud through reuelations. After a more peculiar manner it is attributed, and moſt commonly it is vſed by himſelfe, when hee ſpeaketh of himſelfe, but once giuen by any other to him, namely; Act. 7.56.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Mark. 2.13.
                           And he went forth againe by the Sea ſide, and all the multitude reſorted vnto him, and he taught them.
                           14. And as he paſſed by, hee ſaw Leuithe Sonne of Alpheus, ſitting at the receit of cuſtome, and he ſaid vnto him, follow me, and he aroſe and followed him.
                        
                     
                     THis is the ſixteenth Hiſtory of the firſt yeere of Chriſt his publike Miniſtery, and it is the laſt which is recorded by the Euangeliſts of that yeere. That it followes next vpon the Hiſtory afore going, appeares in that, by all the three Euangeliſts that record it, it is placed next after; It is recorded here and by Matthew 9.9. and by Luke 5.27.28. Matthew hath nothing but what the other haue. Marke addes the

whole, 13. verſe, and ſecondly that he was the Sonne of Alpheus.
                     
                     
                        Luke verſe 27. expreſſely calleth him a Publican, which is alſo implied by the other. and verſe 28. addes that he left all. In varietie of phraſes, Matthew and Marke ſay, as hee paſſed by. Luke, as he went forth. Matthew ſaith, from thence. Luke after theſe things. Wherein is no difference. Mark and Luke call him Leui. Matthew by a knowne name cals him Matthew. The ſumme of this Hiſtorie is, the calling of one of Chriſts Diſciples, and in number the ſixt. The firſt was Philip, Simon, or Peter and Andrew; Ioh. 1. and Iames, and Iohn Marke 1.
                     The parts of this Story are firſt Chriſts preparation vnto this worke, viz. his preaching; whereof note; Firſt, the time [againe] ſhewing that this was done immdiately after the former. Secondly, the place towards the Sea ſide; Thirdly, the occaſion, the reſort of the people; Fourthly, the Act it ſelfe, he preached vnto them the Word of God: which we will but briefely run ouer, hauing beene handled heretofore in other Hiſtories.
                     1. Here in generall, we ſee how ready Chriſt is to doe one good worke after another. Secondly, how ready he is ſtill to affoord more and more meanes for the ſtrengthning of Faith, when he ſeeth any beginnings thereof; hauing now ſeene what effect the former miracle had wrought in the hearts of the people, how they were amazed, how they wondred, how they glorifie
                           •
                         God for it, &amp;c. Here vpon to confirme their faith, he doth againe preach vnto them, and performe this great worke, in forgiuing the ſinnes of this Publican, as before hee had forgiuen the ſinnes of the palſie man. Thus God ſent an interpreter to the Eunuch, whileſt hee was conſcionable in the vſe of ſuch meanes, as God afforded him. And this did Chriſt promiſe to Nathaneel Ioh. 1.50.
                     2. The place is the Sea ſide, noted to ſhew that the place of the receite of Cuſtome, was nigh the Sea ſide. Where we may note againe, that which hath beene often obſerued vpon like occaſion, that Chriſt hauing the opportunitie to preach,

maketh vſe of any place, as wee may doe likewiſe in caſe of neceſſitie.
                     3. In the occaſion note the readineſſe of the People to heare.
                     4. And againe, Chriſts readineſſe to inſtruct them, of both which hath beene ſpoken at other times; as alſo that Chriſt doth account this viz. Preaching his chiefe worke: when they would haue made him a Iudge, he refuſed it. And it codemneth the practiſe of many Miniſters of the Word now a dayes, who buſie themſelues in other matters, who will bee Iuſtices of peace, and decide controuerſies, &amp;c. But regard Preaching leaſt of all.
                     In the worke it ſelfe, note:
                     1. The Occaſion of this mans calling, namely Chriſt paſſing by that way, and ſeeing of him; which came not by chance, and fortune, but of the purpoſe of Chriſt, and the good prouidence of God directing. Where note that fit occurrences of matters are euident ſignes of Gods prouidence, but of this heretofore.
                     2. He ſaw him: Chriſt ſaw Leui, and not Leui Chriſt, which ſhewes the preuenting grace of Chriſt.
                     2. The Partie called, who is deſcribed firſt by his name, that is Leui, which is an Hebrew name, and ſhewes that this man was a Iew. It was firſt giuen to Iacobs three ſonnes. Gen. 29.34. where the ſignification of it is to be ſeene. This aggrauates the matter, that he being a Iew, was yet a Publican.
                     This name of Leui, was in time worne out, and hee not commonly knowne by that name, but by his other name of Matthew, and yet Marke and Luke, writing of him now liuing doth vſe this name, thereby ſhewing their charitie, in concealing of his faults and blemiſhes.
                     2. Matthew which is likewiſe an Hebrew word ſignifying giuen; but it is alſo a Greeke, or a Romane name, and it might be giuen vnto him to blot out that former infamie, that he being a Iew, would yet be a Publican, and an extortioner of his owne nation: by this name he was moſt commonly knowne,

and yet himſelfe writing of himſelfe, ſpareth not to vſe this name, regarding more the glory of God, and the good of the Church by this his conuerſion, then his owne credit and reputation. So Dauid doth in the title of the 51 Pſalme. So Paul, 1. Tim. 1.13. but when he ſpeaketh to the honour of himſelfe, he ſpeaketh in the third perſon, 2. Cor. 12. for it was not themſelues, nor their owne honour they ſought for, but the manifeſtation of the grace of God.
                     This firſt ſhewes, by what Spirit they were guided, not of fleſh and blood, but by the Spirit of 
                           •
                        od, of humilitie and meekeneſſe. The wicked indeed may acknowledge their faults themſelues, but they ſpeake not of them with ſhame, as doe thoſe men. This humble ſpirit in any man, is a ſigne and euidence of the Spirit of God.
                     Secondly, this makes for the truth of the Story, that the Writers thereof makes ſuch conſcience of the truth, when it doth tend to glory, that withall they let not to publiſh their owne blemiſhes. Now if a man will lye, he will do it to ſaue his owne credit and reputation.
                     Secondly, he is deſcribed by his Parentage; he is the ſonne of Alpheus; not he that was the Father of Iames and Iudas the Apoſtles, Luk. 6.15, 16. but another, who whether they were of kinne, or no, it is not expreſt; onely this is noted, that theſe two Alpheus had ſonnes that were Diſciples. This is noted to ſhew the truth of the Story.
                     Thirdly, by his Office, Luke calleth him, chap. 5. verſ. 27.2 Publican, expreſly. Now Publicans were certaine Officers in the Romane Empire, which did gather vp the tribute that was to be paid, and ſuch gifts as were giuen. And becauſe the goods of the Empire were called Publica, hence came the name of Publicans; an office in it ſelfe lawfull: for Iohn, when the Publicans came vnto him, bid them not leaue their Calling as vnlawfull, but deale honeſtly in it; Luk. 3.13. Yet were theſe Publicans vile perſons, and vilely accounted of; either becauſe they were ſo in the eſtimation of the Iewes, who accounting themſelues a free people, could not endure to be vnder tribute, and ſo hated thoſe that were gatherers of the tribute: or elſe

becauſe of their owne miſ-demeanour, beeing grieuous ex-actors and oppreſſors of the people, for they did farme the tribute of the Empire, and ſo did extort from the people much aboue the due for their owne gaine: as may appeare, Luk. 3.13. and by that of Zacheus, Luk. 19.8. ſo Matth. 5.46, 47. inplying thereby Publicans to be moſt grieuous ſinners, and in the cenſure of the Church, Matth. 18.17. whereby it appeares, that theſe Publicans were notorious wicked men, and odious to the people, and much more this man being a Iew, and ſo oppreſſed his owne Countreymen.
                     We haue heard before in the calling of the other Diſciples, how it pleaſed Chriſt to chuſe meane men to be his Diſciples; and here we ſee he chuſeth for his Diſciple, a vile notorious ſinfull man, that had a brand and marke aboue the reſt, which firſt ſhewes the freeneſſe of Gods grace; 1. Tim. 1.13. 1. Cor. 15.10. and ſecondly, the aboundant riches of his grace, verſ. 14. of the firſt of Timothy, the firſt Chapter. 3. Chriſt did it to this end, that the Apoſtles, and other miniſters of grace, ſhould the more boldly and confidently offer grace to the moſt vile and wicked perſons, conſidering that euen amongſt them there was one as vile as any. Fourthly, to encourage all ſorts, how wicked ſoeuer, to yeeld vnto the grace of God offered vnto them, 1. Tim. 1.16.
                     
                        Vſe is, firſt, that we ſhould take notice of this grace of God, and obſerue what a great alteration it is able to make. This man, who before was counted amongſt the wicked, a moſt wicked perſon, is now eſteemed among the godly a holy man: he that was of a vile calling before, is now of a moſt glorious calling: before a moſt vile Publican, becauſe a Iew, now a a moſt glorious Apoſtle, becauſe alſo an Euangeliſt; for but two of the Apoſtles were Euangeliſts, Iohn and Matthew: See the like, Eſay 11.6, 7, 8.
                     Secondly, that none ſhould deſpaire.
                     Thirdly, to teach vs to ſuppreſſe our cenſures concerning the latter end of any man.
                     Fourthly, that we thinke not the worſe of Miniſters, or of their Miniſtery, who in time haue been wicked liuers, ſwaggerers,

and the like: for it pleaſeth God euen amongſt ſuch, to call many vnto that Worke, pulling them out of the ſnares of the Diuell, that they may more pitty others, and apply the greater conſolations vnto them.
                     Thirdly, the place where hee was called, was the Receite of Cuſtome, either a houſe whither they brought their tribute, or a table where he ſate with his money-bookes of account, and ſuch like.
                     
                        Doct. God calles man when he left thinkes of it. Matthew was now buſie about his trade and gettings, hee little thought of Chriſt. So Paul is called, whileſt he yet breathed out ſlaughters.
                     To ſhew, that our conuerſion comes from the grace of God, that to him all glory may be giuen.
                     And this thing, if we apply to our owne ſelues, we ſhall find euer, that wee were conuerted when wee thought not of it; whereof this Hiſtory and the reſt are types, though not in regard of the extraordinary manner.
                     Fourthly, the manner of calling: it was done by the onely word of Chriſt, Follow me. Which although it may ſignifie generally to leaue a former wicked courſe of life, and to turne to Chriſtianity, and ſo to follow Chriſt: yet here it ſignifieth more peculiarly to be with Chriſt, and to attend vpon him: for thus did Chriſt traine vp his Diſciples with him, the more to fit them to their great Calling.
                     Note heare how powerfull the voyce of Chriſt is; he ſaith only, Follow me, and Matthew leaueth all, and goeth after him.
                     Fifthly, his obedience, hee left all that might bee an hinderance vnto him: he followes Chriſt without caſting any doubts and difficulties how he ſhould be prouided for, that he had before vndergone the enuie of the people, and ſhould now incurre the diſpleaſure and hatred of the Phariſes, &amp;c. but preſently without any more adoe followes him. And this teacheth vs, when wee heare the voyce of Chriſt ſounding in our eares, and ſmiting our hearts, that we doe willingly and readily obey: but of theſe things more hath been ſpoken in handling the calling of the other Diſciples.
                  
               
               
                  
                  AN EXPOSITION VPON THE THIRD OF LVKE.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Luk. 3.19.20.
                           But Herod the Tetrarch, being reprooued by him for Herodian his brother Philips wife, and for all the euils which Herod had done,
                           Addeth this aboue all, that he ſhut vp Iohn in priſon.
                        
                     
                     
                        IN handling the harmony of the Goſpell, if we compare, Matth. 4.12. and Mark. 1.14. with Ioh. 4.1, 2, 3. it will appeare, that this ſtory of Iohn Baptiſts death fell out after that he had giuen that teſtimony of Chriſt, Ioh. 3. before Chriſt went to Galile, when by the way he talked with the woman of Samaria, Ioh. 4. And the order of matter requires it, in that he ſhould be then taken away from his Miniſtery, when hee ended ſo good a worke, God thereby prouiding for his credit and honour.
                     Now it is ſet downe by three Euangeliſts, Matthew, Marke, and Luke, neither of which doe record it in order of time. Luke ſets it downe by anticipation, becauſe hauing treated of Iohn in his third Chapter he would ſpeake of all that befell him in that place, ſo ſetting downe this ſtory before, when it ſhould haue been handled after. Matthew and Marke ſet it downe by occaſion of a common ſpeech, that Iohn was rayſed from the dead: Matth. 14 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. Markae, the conciſeſt and briefeſt in gathering the ſummes of Hiſtory, is in this the longeſt, Chapter 6. verſ. 17, 18, 19, &amp;c. All agree in the maine ſubſtance, that Herod did impriſon Iohn for reproouing him for marrying

his brothers wife. They differ onely in adding ſome circumſtances: as Luke addes, firſt, that Herod was a Tetrarch: ſecondly, that Herod was rebuked of Iohn in plaine termes: thirdly, that he rebuked him of all the euils that he had done: fourthly, that hee added this yet aboue all. Matthew agrees with Marke, but addes the cauſe why Herod killed not Iohn, becauſe hee feared the people. Marke addes; firſt, that Herod ſent either Purſeuants, or ſouldiers, or the like: ſecondly, that expreſſely Herod had married Herodias: thirdly, that Herodias had a quarrell with Iohn. Fourthly, why Herodias could not haue her minde, becauſe of Herods affection to Iohn. We will handle them all in one ioynt Text, which may be diuided into three parts:
                     Firſt, the cauſe of his impriſonment: ſecondly, the manner thereof: thirdly, the euent and iſſue intended againſt him.
                     In the cauſe, viz. Iohns rebuking, conſider, firſt, who rebuked; Iohn. Secondly, whom; Herod. Thirdly, for what, for marrying his brothers wife.
                     The manner, ſhewes, firſt, how hee was taken; he was ſent for. Secondly, how he was vſed, firſt, he was bound: ſecondly, put in priſon: thirdly, there ſhut vp.
                     The euent was the danger of his life; which came firſt, from Herod: ſecondly, from Herodias: and was eſcaped by Herods affection, firſt, towards Iohn, this hindred Herodias purpoſe: 2. towards the people, this hindred his owne purpoſe.
                     The party rebuking was Iohn, a publike Miniſter of the Goſpell ſent of God, to preach Faith in the remiſſion of repentance and conuerſion from ſinnes. He was both a Miniſter, and an extraordinary one, by vertue of which calling he had power and authority to reprooue all whereſoeuer he came.
                     
                        Doct. Publique Miniſters of the Word, they among others are eſpecially bound to reprooue publique offences: Ezek. 3.17. Eſay 58.1. 2. Tim. 4.2.
                     For the calling of Miniſters doth require thus much at their hands, becauſe they are Watchmen ouer mens ſoules, and reproofe doth belong to the cure of mens ſoules. Heb. 13.17. Ezek. 3.17, 18.
                  
               
               
                  
                  AN EXPOSITION VPON THE FOVRTH OF IAMES.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Iames 4.7.
                           Reſiſt the Diuell, and he will flye from you.
                        
                     
                     
                        THeſe words containe a commandement, [Reſiſt the Diuell:] and a promiſe, [and he will flye from you.] In the commandement two things are to be marked, firſt, an action; ſecondly, the obiect of that action. The action is a Reſiſtance, the obiect, the Diuell. Firſt, of the obiect. By the Diuell here is meant all ſinnes and temptations ariſing eitheir from that corruption that is in vs, and ſo from our ſelues; or elſe ſpringing from external obiects, and ſuch motions as are by the Diuell immediately ſuggeſted vnto vs. All which are termed by the name of Diuell, becauſe he hath the chiefe hand in theſe matters, and is a principall agent therein. The action of reſiſtance is that, whereby a ſpirituall ſouldier of Chriſt Ieſus doth ſtriue and endeauour according to that meaſure of grace that is giuen him to auoide all ſinnes whatſoeuer, and to pleaſe God in all things, not to offend him in any. This action thus explained in generall, reſpecting the whole courſe of mans life: let vs conſider it therefore in a more particular regard, according as we are to put it in practice at ſeuerall combats, with ſeuerall temptations.
                     For the better performance of it, we are to conſider three things: firſt, our preparation before the combate. Secondly, our behauiour in the very time of the aſſault. Thirdly, our demeanour when the fight is ended. For the firſt, it is needfull

that we be armed for our defence; the parts of which ſpirituall armour, we may ſee affoorded vnto vs out of the Eph. 6.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. The firſt peece, is to haue our loynes girt about with verity: that is, an heart firmely grounded and eſtabliſhed in the truth, in certainty of Gods pure worſhip and Religion, that we be not carried about with euery blaſt of outſide doctrine. The ſecond, is the Breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe; that is, a ſtedfaſt reſolution of the heart, to be vpright, righteous, and holy before God in all things, not will

                        ng to offend him in the leaſt: as Dauid ſaith, Pſal. 40.8. I haue deſired to doe thy good will, O my God; yea, thy Law is within mine heart. The next part, is to haue our feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpell of peace: which is an vndaunted and ready minde to make a conſtant profeſſion of the Goſpell in all places, and at all times, though it bee to loſſe of lands, goods, liuing, yea, life: as Saint Peter wiſheth vs, to put on our Sandals, and to be ready to giue an account of our Faith to euery one that ſhall require it of vs. The fourth is the Shield of Faith; which is a liuely and ſtedfaſt perſwaſion and aſſurance of the mercie of God in Ieſus Chriſt, particularly belonging vnto vs; the force of which, is to quench all the fiery darts of the Diuell; that is, all ſtrong, all ſudden, and all dangerous temptations by him ſuggeſted. A fift, is the Helmet of ſaluation, which, as it is 1. Theſ. 5.8. is the hope of euerlaſting life, whereby our heads being couered, may be preſerued from doubt and deſpaire. Another is the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God: the vſe of which is, that we ought to labour to bee furniſhed with ſuch pregnant places of Scripture, as whereby we may both defend our ſelues, and offend Satan, according as Chriſt did, Matth. 4. The laſt is Prayer, whereby we muſt intreate the ayde and aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, to ſtrengthen vs to the combate. Our behauiour in the combate ought to be guided by theſe rules:
                     Firſt, entertaine not with any liking the firſt motions to ſin, but reſiſt the primary beginning, intiſements, and occaſions to them, and ſuffer them not to haue a place of abode in heart and affection.
                     
                        Reaſ. 1. From the nature of ſinne, which being not at the

firſt, repelled quickly gets ground of vs. By the example of Dauid, who firſt was idle, then looked; the temptation left him not there, but then hee luſted, and afterwards committed actuall folly: 2. Sam. 11. So Peter, firſt, he denied barely; ſecondly, then he ſware it; thirdly, he curſed and denied: Ma
                              •
                           . 26.70, 72, 74.
                     Secondly, becauſe the Diuell as he is ſtrong, ſo is he ſubtile: giue him an Inch, and he will take an Ell. Giue him but entrance to ſet foote into your heart, and you ſhall hardly chuſe but he will poſſeſſe it wholly.
                     Thirdly, put not too much truſt and confidence in our owne ſtrength, but rather to be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, Epheſ. 6.10. This confident boldneſſe, and reliance on our owne ability, cauſed Peters fall, Luk. 22.33.
                     Fourthly, we muſt not beleeue the Diuell, nor hearken to his perſwaſion and reaſons; nay, nor truſt him, though hee ſpake truth. So when the Diuell tooke on him to be a Preacher, Acts 16.16, 17, 18. Paul would not ſuffer him to ſpeake, but cōmanded him forth. So Chriſt rebuked the Diuell, Luk 4.34, 35. Eue ſinned by being credulous, in beleeuing the Diuell when he vttered a loud lye, Gen. 3.3, 4.
                     Fifthly, wee muſt conſider what profit a ſtout reſiſtance doth bring viz. that the Diuell will bee the weaker, the more foiles he receiues, and we the ſtronger.
                     Laſtly, take heed that we compare not the pleaſures of ſinning and yeelding to the temptation, with the paine of reſiſtance, for then ſoone ſhall wee faile: but rather compare the paine of reſiſtance with the horrors, anguiſh, and perplexitie of an euill conſcience, which follow the committing of any ſinne, and ſee whether is rather to be vndergone. The burden of an euill conſcience. Salomon (Prou. 18.14.) deſcribeth, ſaying, The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtaine his infirmity, but a wounded ſ
                              •
                           irit who can beare it? After the combate ended, if thou obtaine the victory, firſt, giue God the glory and prayſe, not aſcribing it to any ſtrength, or worthineſſe in thy ſelfe; take heed of this pride. Secondly, auoide ſecuritie, and thinke not when thou haſt ouercome one, then thou haſt vanquiſht all; but know,

that one temptation, like waues, come one in the necke of another. And therefore prouide thy ſelfe for a new aſſault. If thou be ouercome, thinke with thy ſelfe, that, it may bee, God hath let you fall, thereby to puniſh ſome ſinne in thee. Secondly, lye not in ſinne, but endeauour to renew thy ſelfe by repentance, knowing that it is as great, if not a greater victorie, to recouer being fallen, then to auoide a fall.
                     Encouragements to this dutie are, firſt, the promiſe here made, that he wil flye from vs, like a coward, that ſeeing his aduerſarie buckle his armour to encounter with him, takes him to his heeles. Secondly, conſider the intent of Satan in allu
                           •
                        ing vs to ſinne; that it is not for our good, but for our deſtruction. So let vs not yeeld to his pleaſures, and be drawne away by his allurements. Thirdly, learne the nature of ſinne, that is it ſuch as laies vs open to the iudgements of God both here, and hereafter. Laſtly, thinke of thoſe many mercies God hath vouchſafed; and then ſay with Ioſeph, How can I doe this, and ſo ſinne againſt my God, Gen. 39.9.
                     One thing to bee performed in the time of combate is left out, which is this, that when the Diuell laboureth by any temptation to draw vs into any vice, we ſhould not onely withſtand and reſiſt this temptation, but alſo endeauour to doe the contrary vertue: as Ioſeph being tempted to adultery, exerciſed himſelfe to chaſtitie, Geneſ. 39. and Iob, who when Satan had done all that he could to make him curſe, and blaſpheme God, did not onely not doe that, but did the contrary, he bleſſed and prayſed the Name of God, Iob 1. laſt verſe.
                  
               
               
                  
                  AN EXPOSITION VPON THE SECOND OF GENESIS.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Geneſ. 2.9.
                           And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow euery tree that is pleaſant to the ſight, and good for food: the tree of life alſo in the midſt of the Garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and euill.
                        
                     
                     
                        FIrſt, ſome Sacraments God gaue vnto man, firſt, in his innocent eſtate, which were two; firſt, the Tree of Life; ſecondly, the Tree of Knowledge of good and Euill.
                     Secondly, ſome in his corrupt eſtate; Firſt, either before Chriſt prefiguring him: Secondly, or after Chriſt, as memorials of him.
                     Thirdly, Sacraments before Chriſt were of two ſorts: firſt, either ſuch as did belong to all ſorts of people. Secondly, ſuch as were peculiarly appropriated to the Iewes.
                     Fourthly, of the forme
                           •
                         ſort were, firſt, the Flood, and Noahs preſeruation in it: ſecondly, the Rainebow.
                     Fifthly, of the later ſort there are two kinds:
                     Sixthly, 1. Some were extraordinary, during but for once, or a ſhort time, and anſwering either to Baptiſme, as 1. Cor. 10. firſt, the Red Sea; ſecondly, the Cloud: or to the Lords Supper, as firſt, the Manna; ſecondly, the water flowing out of the Rocke.
                     Seuenthly, 2. ſome were ordinary: as firſt, Circumciſion anſwering vnto our Baptiſme, 1. Col. 2. ſecondly, the Paſſeouer anſwering to the Lords Supper.
                     
                        Eightly, Sacraments after Chriſts comming to continue till the end of the World, are two: Firſt, Baptiſme; Secondly, the Supper of the Lord.
                     The two Trees are deſcribed: Firſt, by their place: firſt, generall, the Garden; ſecondly, particular, the middeſt of it.
                     Secondly, by their names.
                     
                        Middle,
                        
                           •
                         though this may bee vnderſtood that the T
                           •
                        ee was in the garden, and no more; yet it is better to take it properly, that it ſtood in the very midſt where it might alwaies be ſeene, and thought of by the man.
                     
                        Tree of li
                              •
                           e,] ſome expound this allegorically: but that it is not ſo meant appeares, by the plantation, by the growth, by the fruits they bare, by the ends of their placing there, by the euent of the tranſgreſſion.
                     It was a Sacrament in two reſpects.
                     1. To put man in minde of his preſent [immortall] eſtate, by vertue of his creation.
                     2. To giue him notice of his future eſtate. which ſhould be according as he vſed or abuſed this.
                     
                        The Tree of Knowledge, did aſſure him, that if he did tranſgreſſe, he ſhould die the death.
                     Why it was called the Tree of Life, there is ſome doubt. Some ſaid that it had vigor in it, to preſerue the life in perpetuitie, and immortalitie. But it ſeemes to be otherwiſe: for firſt immortalitie was properly giuen to man in his creation, why then ſhould we giue it to the Tree of life? Secondly, then it muſt either haue kept him from ſin, or haue giuē him immortalitie, whether he had ſinned or no; both are falſe. And to the obiections, which may ſeeme to confirme that opinion, as firſt out of chapter 3.22. Leaſt man ſhould put forth his hands &amp;c.] Wee anſwere that it is taken Ironically, to lay forth mans conceit plainely.
                     2. Why then man ſhould be driuen out of Paradiſe? Aanſw. Firſt, becauſe that he might the better know, that he was indeed depriued of life, being now thruſt from the ſigne. Secondly, to ſhew that he was not worthie of the thing ſignified, viz. life, becauſe he was vnworthie of the ſigne. Thirdly,

to ſhew that the ſigne doth not belong to them, who haue no right and title to the thing ſignified. For now Adam had loſt l
                           •
                        fe eternall, whereof this was a ſigne. Then the ſafeſt reſolution is, that this Tree, was called the Tree of life, becauſe it was ordained of God a ſigne and pledge of life eternall, ſo long as man remained obedient.
                     So that other tree was a ſigne and ſeale of that wo
                           •
                        full knowledge that man ſhould haue, if hee did tranſgreſſe: not that this tree could infuſe any knowledge.
                     Now this did ſeale vp eternall life in two reſpects.
                     1. In aſſuring him that he was now immortall by his creation, and that he ſhould continue therein.
                     2. In a repreſentation of Chriſt, who is life, Col. 3.4. Prou. 5. 8. Ioh. 1.4. For man in his innocent eſtate, ſhould haue had neede of Chriſt, though not to be incarnate, yet as hee is the wiſedome of the Father, and the power of God, by whom all things were created. So this was to ſhew that this life came not from himſelfe, but from Chriſt.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Gen. 7.23.
                           And euery liuing ſubſtance was deſtroyed, which was vpon the face of the ground, both man and cattell, and the creeping things, and the foule of the Heauen; and they were deſtroyed from the Earth: and Noah onely remained aliue, and they that were with him in the Arke.
                        
                     
                     THeſe words layes downe the euent of that great deluge, and containes in them two points. Firſt, that the World and other creatures were deſtroyed Secondly, that Noah, and the reſt of his family were preſerued They are a ground of that third Sacrament before mentioned. In handling of which, we will conſider three points.
                     1. That this is a Sacrament, which is apparent by that application which Saint Peter m
                           •
                        kes of; 1. Pet. 3.21. where he maketh Baptiſme, and the flood, alike figures repreſenting one thing. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         is a reſemblance of a thing, and 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         a like reſemblance of the ſame thing [ſometime.] For we are not to

vnderſtand this, as a ſubordinate Sacrament, or as a Figure of Baptiſme, for then it followes. Firſt, that a Sacrament may be a ſigne of a Sacrament. Secondly, that ſomething ſhould bee repreſented to Noah, which he knew not of, for Baptiſme was inſtituted long after.
                     2. What kinde of Sacrament this was; It is firſt, the firſt Sacrament which we reade recorded in Scripture, giuen to the Church, [after the fall of man.] Sacrifices there were as wee reade of Abell and Cain, which were alſo in a manner as Sacraments, becauſe both repreſented Chriſt, and God by that meanes did vphold their faith in expectation of him. But now the Church hauing a long time waited for the accompliſhment of the promiſes, and accounting them to bee now the further of, that they might ſay as it is, 1. Pet. 3 4. It ſtood in more need to be ſupported in faith and hope, and ſo God ordained firſt extraordinarie Sacraments, and then ordinary to continue till Chriſts comming.
                     2. This was an extraordinary Sacrament; ſuch as were thoſe that were either done but once, or did continue but a ſhort time; as the Red Sea, Manna, &amp;c. Now it was extraordinary in two reſpects. Firſt, becauſe it was wrought by a miraculous power of God. Secondly, becauſe it was wrought vpon an extraordinary occaſion: yet neuertheleſſe, though for the Act it was but once for the vſe, it is continuall to the Church of God.
                     3. In what reſpect it is ſaid to be a Sacrament; and theſe are; Firſt, in generall, becauſe it repreſents vnto, and aſſures the Church of God of their deliuerance from the wrath of God, by which all the world beſides periſhed; Secondly, particularly; Firſt, becauſe it did prefigure the killing of the old man, and quickening of the new, and preſeruation of it vnto life eternall. In that the wicked World periſhed, and righteous Noah was preſerued aliue: the which thing is aſcribed to Baptiſme Rom. 6. initio. Secondly, becauſe that as ſafetie was brought to Noah, by meanes of the Arke: ſo ſaluation is not to be had, but only by Chriſt. Act. 4.12.
                     3. Becauſe as the Arke could not ſaue Noah, vnleſſe hee

were in it; ſo likewiſe muſt wee bee in, and of the Church: whereof the Arke was a figure, it repreſenting Chriſt, not as a particular perſon, but as a myſticall body, ioyned with his Church. Other reſemblances their might be made, as; Firſt, that in the Arke were few, ſo they are but few that ioy
                           •
                        e themſelues to the Church, and repoſe confidence in Chriſt. Secondly, that as of thoſe that were in the Arke, one was a curſed Cham. So in the Church there are many Hypocrites: but thoſe before alleaged, are the maine and principall points.
                     The inſtructions that ariſe out of this place are; Firſt, in generall, to ſhew vnto vs, that this Hyſtory is analogicall; it hath not only an hyſtoricall, but alſo a myſticall and ſpirituall ſenſe. Neither yet will it follow, that one place may haue two ſenſes; for theſe are but two parts of one entire and full ſenſe.
                     
                        Queſt. But how may a man know when their is a myſtery, beſides the hyſtory?
                     
                        Anſw. This we may know; Firſt, by a diligent obſeruation of the circumſtances. As the Apoſtle doth prooue by circumſtances; Heb. 4.7. that what the Prophet Dauid ſpeaketh; Pſal. 95.7. muſt be vnderſtood of the ſpirituall reſt. So Act. 2.29. Peter prooues Dauids ſpeech to be meant of Chriſt; Secondly, by comparing one place with another, the Old Teſtament with the New: as that of the Red Sea. By 1. Cor. 10. That in Exod. 12.46. with Ioh. 19.36. thence we muſt learne diligently to marke the Scriptures, to obſerue the circumſtances, but eſpecially thoſe applications that the Holy Ghoſt maketh, becauſe this is the ſureſt way.
                     2. That God doth performe a double benefit to his children, by temporall preſeruation. Firſt, ſafety from temporall danger. Secondly, aſſurance of deliuerance and redemption from ſinne; which as it ſhewes the tender care of God ouer vs, ſo it teacheth in all temporall preſeruations, to haue an eye to him, in regard of our ſoules, for if God be mercifull to preſerue our bodies, how much more our ſoules; and though all temporall deliuerances are not Seales and Sacraments of this yet this vſe may we well make of them. But withall as Noah
                        
did, ſo muſt we.
                     1. Beleeue Gods promiſes, and apply them to our ſelues.
                     2. And alſo yeeld our ſelues to the direction of his Word, in regard of the meanes to accompliſh the ſame; which is a maine and principall vſe of this ſtory.
                     3. Hence obſerue, that thoſe things which worke deſtruction to the wicked, are a meanes of preſeruation to the Godly; as was the Red Sea. The Angell that went behinde the Iſraelites campe. Chriſt, the Word, the Sacraments; which is for the comfort of the faithfull, that they need not be terrified with thoſe iudgements that befall on others. For as a mercy ſhewed to the faithfull, ſhall be no aduantage to the wicked, ſo a iudgement lighting on the wicked, ſhall be no damage to the godly, I meane in regard of that which is indeed, viz. ſpirituall hurt, or ſpirituall bleſſings.

                     To finde out the Miniſtery hereof, wee muſt conſider that leauen is taken; Firſt, in the good part, Matth. 13.33. for the Kingdome of Heauen; and ſo the oppoſition ſtands not here. Secondly, in a bad ſence, for corruption in Doctrine and prauitie in life and conuerſation; and ſo in this place vnleauened bread muſt be taken, as ſignifying ſincerity in conuerſation and truth, in doctrine; 1. Cor. 5.8. Matth. 16.6.12.
                     
                        Vſe, of this is to teach vs, that all that will partake of Chriſt aright, muſt be ſoundly inſtructed in the Doctrine of faith and puritie and innocencie of life; 1. Tim. 1.19. which belongs not only to Miniſters but to all others as Eph. 4.15. Truth in Loue, which is the fulfilling of the Law; Col. 1.10.
                     2. That thoſe that are either depraued in their iudgement, or corrupted in life and conuerſation are not fit to eate of Chriſt as Idolaters, Heretikes; Gal. 3.1. malicious perſons, &amp;c.
                     3. From the metaphor of leauen, whoſe nature is, that a little doth ſeaſon the whole lumpe. 1. Cor. 5.6. learne that we haue a ſpeciall care to withſtand euery error, &amp;c. euery ſinne, not contenting our ſelues that wee are not open Idolaters or notorious ſinners, ſeeing a drop of poyſon will infect a whole cup of medicinable potion, an one error or ſinne, will make a breach in conſcience, big enough to giue the Diuell entrance into the poſſeſſion of all; ſo Heb. 12.15. when any roote of bitterneſſe doth but peepe vp, wee muſt nip it: and not only ought we to auoid the ſinnes, but alſo infectious perſons, as Here
                           •
                        ikes, Idolaters, prophane perſons, not to be companions with them; 1. Cor. 5.13. Rom. 16.17.
                     
                        Sowre herbes. Heb. it is bitterneſſe, which ſome expound bitterneſſe and anguiſh of heart: but conſidering that here is ſpoken of thoſe outward things, where with it was to bee eaten: I take it to be rather meant of ſome ſowre herbes, or ſauce as the like.
                     
                        
                        Reaſon, of this was that they ſhould haue a meanes to put them in minde of that anguiſh and vexation they ſuffered in Egypt.
                     Myſterie implied is two folde.
                     1. That the profeſſion of Chriſt is ioyned with affliction; Luk. Act. 14.22. 2. Tim. 3.12.
                     2. That to the partaking of Chriſt wee muſt come with contrition of heart; Matth. 11.28. Luk. 7.38.
                     Of this a double vſe may be made.
                     1. That if wee looke to haue part in Chriſt, wee muſt not expect that all things ſhould be ſweete and pleaſant; but in our profeſſing of Chriſt, and inioying of him, we muſt looke to haue ſowre ſauce, to this ſweet meate; leſt in regard of the corruption of nature, this ſweetneſſe grow full ſowre, and we loath it: wherefore as this muſt ſtirre vs vp to patience, ſo muſt it teach vs how to eſteeme of afflictions, as of ſauce to make vs relliſh our meate, and to haue the more appetite to it.
                     2. That when we approach to Chriſt to reape any benefit by him, we muſt come with a contrite heart. Pſal. 51.17.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Exod. 12.11.
                           And thus ſhall ye eate it: with your loynes girded, your ſhooes on your feete, and your ſtaffe in your hand: and yee ſhall eate it in haſte: it is the Lords paſſeouer.
                        
                     
                     IN this verſe is ſet downe in what manner the paſſeouer, was to be eaten, expreſſed in foure branches. Firſt, your loines girded; ſecondly, your ſhooes on your feete; Thirdly, your ſtaues in your handes; Fourthly, ye ſhall eate it in haſte.
                     
                     In which in generall, we ſee that they imply a kindneſſe to take a Iourney. The myſterie whereof is, firſt that there muſt be in vs a promptneſſe and readineſſe to that worke, whereunto God ſhall call vs, a duty much commended vnto vs in Scripture; Pſal. 57.7. &amp; 27.8. Matthew 11.12. Luk. 16.16. Pſal. 40.7. Heb. 10.7. For ſuch a promptneſſe and readineſſe, is a ſigne of th
                           •
                         willingneſſe and cheerefulneſſe of our hearts a

thing moſt acceptable to God; 2. Cor. 9.7. And it reprooues he backewardneſſe and ſluggiſhneſſe of men, to come to the ordinance of God, to preaching on the Sabboth, to the Sacrament, &amp;c.
                     2. Hereb is ſignified that we bee ready, for our paſſge from the Aegypt of this world, vnro this Canaan of Heauen: for theſe were a type of the other; Matth. 24.42. 1. Theſſ. 5.6. Becauſe we know not when our paſſage ſhall bee, as the Iſraelites knew not at what houre of the night they were then to depart.
                     This reprooues, the ſecuritie of men, that thinke leſt of their departure hence, as that common and wicked ſpeech ſheweth; I thought no more of it, then of my dying day. From which, want of due preparation, it commeth that when the time of departure is at hand, men become either dead in heart, and vncapable of all comfort, like Naball, or like Belſhazer, are filled with feare, horror, and amazement, winhin and without. Dan. 7.6. Let vs bee rather like the wiſe Virgins, and that faithfull Seruant; Luke 12.36. alwaies attending and looking for the comming of his Maſter.
                     Now come we to the particular branches.
                     1. Your loynes girded, which phraſe is vſed in the Scripture, in a double reſpect.
                     1. For a cloſe and faſt girding of a mans apparell vnto his middle
                     
                     2. For a truſſing vp of his garments, vnto his girdle.
                     The former is taken from Souldiers, that buckle their Armour together with their girdle; as God bid Iob gird vp his loines, when he would haue him ſtand to his defence, and anſwere for himſelfe; Iob 38.3. &amp; 40.2. in the like ſence; Epheſ. 6.14. and this ſence is not here meant, for God would not that they ſhould prepare themſelues to fight with Pharao.
                     
                     For the better vnderſtanding of the latter ſence, wee are to know, that in thoſe Eaſterne countries, they went with long ſide gownes hanging downe to their legges, which were an impediment in trauelling, if they were not truſſed vp. And

therefore they being now to take a long iourney, God bids them truſſe vp their gownes to their girdles; in this ſence are 1. King. 18.46. 2. King. 4.29. &amp; 9.1.
                     The myſterie is, that wee ſuffer not any thing to hinder vs in our courſe and worke that we goe about; this is not meant of ſuch things that are vnlawfull and wicked, but of thoſe that be lawfull, good, and as needfull as our apparrell, that if we obſerue any hinderance to proceede from them in our holy courſe, to be carefull to remooue it, which as it is meant; Ier. 1.17. Luk. 12 35. 1. Pet. 1.13. So without a metaphor it is plainely expreſſed; Heb. 12.1.
                     For it is a point of wiſedome, when wee aime at any thing to remooue all impediments, or elſe we venture the loſſe of the thing we aime at.
                     
                        Vſe, That when lawfull things doe become hinderances, as they doe many times by our immoderate vſe of them, our doting vpon them, or preferring of them to other better things; Luke 14.18. &amp;c. wee doe take them away, and abridge our ſelues of them; 1. Cor. 7.31.
                     2. For reproofe of thoſe that care not what burden they lay vpon their backes, how many offices they get, how much lands and liuings they heape vp, what pleaſures, what company they follow, though in the meane time they be by theſe things hindred from attending vnto better duties, to the worſhip and ſeruice of God.
                     2. Your ſhooes one your feete.
                     
                     What! were they wont to weare no ſhooes on their feete.
                     
                        Anſw. It may be when they tooke their repaſt, they had no ſhooes on, it being the cuſtome to lie on Carpets, on which alſo they went. Ioh. 13.23.
                     2. It may be that they had ſhooes which they did weare at meales, and others which were for iourneyes, but there can be but a coniecture at theſe things.
                     Myſterie is, that for the furtherance we may vſe all lawfull helpes. And for this cauſe as their is a fight, ſo is their Armor appointed. Eph. 6. where verſe 15. wee are likewiſe commanded to haue our feete ſhod, with the preparation of the Goſpell

of peace, ſo that albeit the way which we muſt go through be rough and thorny, that is, full of afflictions, yet ſhod and furniſhed with the comforts of the Goſpell, wee may goe on boldly without feare of pricking.
                     3. Staues in your hands.] Staues, we know, ſerues to helpe men in their iourney, and to reſt themſelues vpon when they are weary.
                     Theſe ſtaues are the promiſes of ſaluation, which muſt ſuſtaine and vphold vs, as, Thy Rod and thy Staffe, they comfort me: Pſal. 23.4.
                     
                        Doct. From hence it followeth, That we ought to bee conſcionable in the vſe of thoſe meanes that God hath afforded vs for to helpe our infirmities, as in all things to conſider the reward, &amp;c. Heb. 12.2.
                     And it reprooues thoſe that are bold and preſumptuous of their owne ſtrength and abilitie, and refuſe the meanes appointed, whereby many times they fall away.
                     4. And yee ſhall eate it in haſte.] This is the laſt ceremony, and it is laid downe as a reaſon of the former. And the reaſon of this reaſon is expreſſed, verſ. 33. For God intending to bring that great iudgement on the Egyptians; and foreſeeing how the Egyptians would thereupon deale with the Iſraelites, by forcing them to bee gone vpon the ſudden, hee doth thus prouide, that they ſhould be all in readineſſe to depart.
                     
                        Doct. God is carefull to prouide helpe for his people, when they are in any ſtreights. When the World was on the ſudden to be drowned, he cauſed Noah to make an Arke before hand to ſaue himſelf. When the Children of Iſrael trauailed through the Wilderneſſe, and were to depart from euery place on a ſudden at the riſing of the Cloud and Pillar of fire, God cauſed them to dwell in tents, and not to build houſes. So that euery way he doth fit and prepare his people to thoſe ſtates that hee meanes to bring them. For he that fore-warned, is fore-armed; and troubles that come on a ſudden, make men at their wits end, and cauſe many diſtractions.
                     
                        Vſe is, to be carefull in vſing the meanes that God hath prouided for our good, as becauſe the comming of the Sonne of

man is ſudden, to watch; becauſe as death leaues vs, ſo iudgement will find vs, and the houre thereof vncertaine, it teacheth to be alwaies prepared for death. Thus though they come on a ſudden, they ſhall not be ſudden to vs, &amp;c.
                     The myſtery hereof is, that in this world we haue no place of abode, but muſt alwayes be, as ſtill going out of it. A point manifeſt by the line of the Patriarkes, by the Children of Iſrael in the Wilderneſſe liuing in tents: See Heb. 11.9, 10. 2. Cor. 5. 2. Phil. 1.23. 1. Cor. 15.31. Wee muſt therefore make haſte, and vſe the things of this world in haſte, becauſe wee haue a long iourney to goe, and know not how much time wee haue thereunto. To this end let vs learne, as Pſal. 90.12. and be as the Apoſtle, Phil. 3.13. where the metaphor is taken from runners, that looke not vnto that which they haue runne, but how farre they haue to runne yet vnto the marke.
                     This haſte is to bee made, firſt, for feare of hurt that may come by abiding. Thus the Angels haſtened Lot out of Sodome, leſt he did partake of their puniſhments. So muſt wee haſte, becauſe of temptations of that body of death wee carry about, of ſnares, allurement and diſgraces, &amp;c. whereby we are drawne to forſake the Lord.
                     Secondly, the expectation of a benefit cauſeth men to make haſte; the benefit that commeth to vs, is freedome from ſinne, eternall glory, and the enioying of all good, &amp;c.
                     Some adde vnto theſe a third right, namely, that they did eate it ſtanding. Where of albeit there be ſome probability, becauſe of the former circumſtances (which neuertheleſſe might be all done ſitting after their vſuall manner) yet it is not expreſly ſet downe, and ſo no inference can be drawne from it, that th
                           •
                        refore the beſt manner of geſture to eate the Lords Supper is ſtanding.
                     Now in generall concerning all theſe forenamed Rites, we may obſerue this property; that ſome of them were onely peculiar to this Paſſeouer, and to no other: as firſt, that the Lambe ſhould be kept foure dayes, verſ. 3.6. Secondly, the liberty they had to chuſe a Lambe, or a Kid. Thirdly, the ſprinkling of the blood vpon the doore-poſts. Fourthly, all thoſe

next before mentioned, of eating it with their loynes girded, &amp;c. Fifthly, the not going out of the houſe vntill the morning. Theſe Rites were then commanded and vſed, in regard of the preſent circumſtances and occaſions, but were neuer in vſe afterward. And this may appeare in that, at the ſecond inſtitution of the Paſſeouer, when it was ordained to an anniuerſary rite, they are not repeated, nor yet were performed by Chriſt, when he did abrogate the ſame.
                     And this we may obſerue, that there may be rites in the firſt inſtitution of ordinances, which are not of perpetuall vſe. So in this Paſſeouer they were to keepe their houſes, and to ſprinkle the blood onely at this time, becauſe at this time onely the deſtroyer was to paſſe by: and likewiſe to eate it in ſuch haſte, becauſe now onely they were to bee gone out of Egypt on a ſudden. So in the Lords Supper, Chriſt vſed vnleauened bread, becauſe at that time there was no leauened bread to be eaten: alſo he celebrated it at euening, becauſe it was immediately to ſucceede the Paſſeouer, which was eaten at Euen. So hee ſate at the Lords Supper, hauing ſate before after the faſhion of the Countrey at the Paſſeouer.
                     A rule to know when ſuch rites are occaſionall, as if they be not expreſſed in the words of the inſtitution of the ordinances. Seeing therefore the geſture of ſitting, is neither by the Euangeliſts, nor Saint Paul, repeating the inſtitution, expreſſely ſet downe, wee are herein to ſubmit our ſelues to the orders appointed by the Church.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 14.
                           And this day ſhall be vnto you for a memoriall: and you ſhall keepe it a Feaſt to the Lord, throughout your generations: you ſhall keepe it a Feaſt by an ordinance for euer.
                           14. Seuen dayes ſhall yee eate vnleauened bread, eu
                                 •
                              n the firſt day yee ſhall put leauen out of your houſes: for whoſoeuer eateth leauened bread, from the firſt day to the ſeuenth day, that ſoule ſhall be cut off from Iſrael.
                           16. And in the firſt day there ſhall be an holy Conuocation, and in the ſeuenth day there ſhall be an holy Conuocation to you▪
                              
no manner of worke ſhall be done in them, ſaue that which euery man muſt eate, that onely may be done of you.
                        
                     
                     COncerning the time of the celebration of the Paſſeouer, we are to note, firſt, the beginning; ſecondly, the continuance.
                     1. In the beginning obſerue; firſt, vpon what occaſion it was ordained: ſecondly, on what time of the yeere celebrated.
                     Firſt, the occaſion was that great deliuerance from Pharaoh, and that bondage wherein the Egyptians held them; the ſame night that this deliuerance was to bee ſent, this Paſſeouer was inſtituted. God ſo diſpoſing of it, firſt, in regard of himſelfe, to ſhew that this deliuerance came from him, in that euery thing came to paſſe according as he had before ſignified. Secondly, in regard of the people, to ſtrengthen their faith and hope, that ſeeing all things accompliſhed according to this ſigne, they might beleeue in God, and haue their hearts enlarged to praiſe and truſt in him.
                     Secondly, the time of the yeere on which it was celebrated, is ſet downe, verſ. 18. In the firſt moneth; that is, in the Spring time, anſwering in part to our March. The fourteenth day of the moneth; at the full of the Moone, after the Spring Equinoctiall. God making choice of this time, that euen the time might ſtirre vp their hearts, and encourage them to hope for a deliuerance. Alſo it was a type of Chriſt, whoſe comming brought with it the Spring of grace, of knowledge and illumination, &amp;c.
                     
                        Queſt. Here a queſtion may be moued, whether they were ſtrictly bound to obſerue alwaies this time, and no other.
                     
                        Anſw. To this we anſwer in generall, that they were not ſo ſtrictly tied vnto this time, as that vpon no occaſion it might be altered. This appeares by that ſtory which is recorded, Numb. 9. verſ. 6. to 14.
                     Out of which we may note theſe points;
                     Firſt, that God requires not impoſſibilities of his children, but doth diſpenſe euen with his owne ordinances in caſe of neceſſity,

as here in caſe of legall vncleaneneſſe, by burying a dead man, God gaue them liberty to alter the time vnto another moneth. So in the wilderneſſe was Circumciſion, becauſe of the vncertainty of their iourneyes; and ſo there may be many neceſſary occaſions to hinder a man from the Sacrament, and ſo I doubt not, but if a man that hath long lyen bed
                           •
                        ed, ſhould haue a feruent deſire to receiue the Communion, the place might be altered, and it might be celebrated in a priuate houſe there being company ſufficient to make a Congregation, the like may be ſaid of Baptiſme.
                     Secondly, that it is better to forbeare for a time, then being vnprepared, to come to the Sacrament. Againſt this may bee obiected the example of thoſe that came vnpared to the Paſſeouer, 2. Chron. 30.17, 18. But wee anſwer, that God ſhewed his diſpleaſure at this, in that he plagued them, ver. 20. although at the prayer of Hezekiah, and their own repentance, no doubt he healed them. Alſo they had honeſt hearts, and did this in ignorance, wherefore hee paſſed by their infirmity. Now if there might bee Legall vncleanneſſe without ſinne: and yet thoſe that were thus vncleane, might not come to the Paſſeouer, much more ought wee that are indeed defiled with ſinne, abſtaine for a time, leſt being vnprepard, we make the Sacrament vnfruitfull vnto vs, and an occaſion of bringing iudgement vpon vs, 1. Cor. 11.28.
                     Thirdly, that we doe not wittingly and willingly hinder our ſelues from the Table of the Lord. For theſe men were grieued, that they could not come, as appeares by their complaint to Moſes, which ſhewes they were neceſſarily hindred. And verſ. 13. wee ſee a great iudgement threatned againſt ſuch as might come, and did neglect it.
                     Wherefore it muſt be a matter of neceſſity that hinders vs, and not euery pretext that wee make vnto our ſelues. So likewiſe many will make themſelues vnfit, by continuing in malice and anger againſt others, by which meanes they continue ſtill in impenitency, and alſo ſhew their light eſteeme of Gods ordinance.
                     Fourthly, that if we be neceſſarily hindred at one time, wee

labour to make it vp at another, hereby ſhewing our true deſire and religious care.
                     2. Concerning the continuance of the Paſſeouer, we are to note, firſt, how long it laſted at once for the celebration of it. Secondly, how long it laſted in the continuall ſucceſſion of it from yeere to yeere.
                     Concerning the former, it was celebrated ſeuen whole daies, verſ. 15. to the end that it being a great ordinance, a memoriall of a great benefit, and a type of a greater, it might haue a ſolemne celebration. Now it was kept ſeuen dayes, becauſe it was iuſt ſeuen dayes before their full deliuerance accompliſhed: for the firſt day they came out of Egypt, and the ſeuenth, they paſſed ouer the Red Sea.
                     Here two queſtions may be asked:
                     Firſt, whether they might increaſe, or diminiſh the number of theſe dayes?
                     
                        Anſw. No: they might not alter the dayes, to the end that the myſtery might be alwayes had in remembrance, and be an occaſion to declare vnto their children, when they ſhould aske them the reaſon of them, all the circumſtances of that deliuerance.
                     But in the 2. Chron. 30.23. we reade that it was kept fourteene dayes.
                     
                        Anſw. Firſt, they kept indeed a Feſtiuall ſeuen dayes ouer, but it was not the Paſſeouer. Secondly, if they did celebrate the Paſſeouer ſeuen daies longer, it was becauſe many were vncleane amongſt ſo many people, who could not goe home and come again the next moneth, and ſo they thought that it might be continued other ſeuen dayes, ſo that it was extraordinary: vpon that Law, Num. 9.
                     
                        Queſt. 2. How theſe ſeuen dayes were celebrated.
                     
                        Anſw. 1. In generall all theſe ſeuen dayes were holy, Leu. 23.4.
                     2. But yet we muſt diſtinguiſh betweene the firſt and the laſt day, and the fiue middlemoſt. The fiue middle were holy in theſe reſpects:
                     Firſt, becauſe that rite of eating vnleauened bread was to be continued.
                     
                        Secondly, becauſe on all thoſe ſeuen dayes there were extraordinary ſacrifices to be offered, proper to thoſe dayes, beſides the continuall morning and euening ſacrifice, Leuit. 23.8. Numb. 28.23.
                     Thirdly, becauſe the people were to come together morning and euening to worſhip God, and to feaſt together in a holy reioycing in the Lord, 2. Chron. 30.22. Luk. 2.43.
                     But the firſt and ſeuenth were in a peculiar manner, and more ſtrictly holy. Firſt, becauſe on theſe dayes there was an holy Aſſembly, verſ. 16. Leuit. 23.7, 8, Nvmb. 28.18, 25. What this holy Aſſembly was, ſee Nehem. 8.2, 3, 5, &amp;c.
                     Secondly, in regard that they were not to doe any ſeruile worke on theſe dayes, verſ. 16. to the end they might haue the more liberty to worſhip God, and not to be tyred and wearied with labour on the fiue dayes.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 15.
                           For whoſoeuer eateth leauened bread, from the firſt day vntill the ſeuenth, that ſoule ſhall be cut off from Iſrael.
                        
                     
                     THe laſt thing to be conſidered, is the neceſſity of this Sacrament of the Paſſeouer, and ſo conſequently of the Lords Supper, inſtituted in the roome thereof. That there was a neceſſary obſeruation of it, appeares in two reſpects: Firſt, becauſe it was expreſſely and ſimply commanded of the Lord, verſ. 14. Secondly, becauſe of the penalty laid vpon thoſe that ſhould wilfully neglect, or contemne it, verſ. 15. for although onely this particular Rite of vnleauened bread be here expreſſed, yet by a Synecdoche wee muſt vnderſtand it of the whole Ordinance, ſo that the contempt or neglect is not onely of this rite, but of the whole Ordinance, as appeares by comparing this with Numb. 9.13.
                     That we may more diſtinctly ſee wherein this neceſſity conſiſts, we are to conſider in generall; that a thing is then ſaid to be neceſſary, without which another thing cannot bee. Now this is vſed in two reſpects; firſt, for a thing that is abſolutely neceſſary, without which a thing cannot poſſibly be, ſo as are

the cauſes of things ſaid to be neceſſary. Thus Chriſts death is abſolutely neceſſary for our ſaluation.
                     Secondly, it is taken for that which is neceſſary by conſequence, for the better effecting, and more eaſie performance of a thing.
                     The Sacraments are neceſſary; not as cauſes, for then ſhould they giue grace and ſaluation. But they are neceſſary as a meanes of ſaluation, and that alſo not ſimply: for ſo is Faith the meanes, and this commeth by hearing of the Word, but in theſe two reſpects: firſt, becauſe God hath commanded them, they are his ordinances to trie our obedience; and ſo although we ſhould reape no benefit by them, yet were we to obſerue them. Secondly, in regard of our need, becauſe we are carnall, and are moſt moued with things obiected to our ſenſes, not ſo much apprehending ſpirituall myſteries, and therefore for the helpe of our vnderſtanding, and ſtrengthening of our Faith, God ordained the Sacraments, that ſo more particularly wee might apply Chriſt to our ſelues.
                     Therefore wee muſt diſtinguiſh betweene the outward ſignes, and the thing ſignified.
                     Chriſt is that which the Sacrament repreſents, now to feed on Chriſt, to celebrate this Paſſeouer (for ſo is he called) is abſolutely neceſſary, without which no ſaluation, Ioh. 6.53. But as for the Elements and other Rites, they are neceſſary but in part, not as cauſes, nor as meanes ſimply, without which there were no partaking of Chriſt, but in regard of Gods command, and our better helpe.
                     In the Penalty obſerue, firſt, the Extent thereof; ſecondly, the Perſons againſt whom it is denounced.
                     1. The Extent is in theſe words, [that perſon ſhall be cut off from Iſrael.] To take this in the largeſt extent, it ſetteth forth three things:
                     Firſt, that thoſe that offend againſt this charge, ſhall bee ſeparated from the communion and fellowſhip of the people of God, and ſo be accounted as Heathen men, 1. Cor. 5. laſt, alludeth hereunto.
                     Secondly, the taking of them cleane from the face of the

earth, either ordinarily by the ſword of the Magiſtrate: for ſo this cutting off is taken, Exod. 31.14, 15. or extraordinarily by the hand of God.
                     Thirdly, a depriuation of ſaluation and debarring from life eternall, a cutting off from hauing fellowſhip with the body of Chriſt hereafter, becauſe here they ſo little regarded the communion of his members; as Pſal. 69.28.
                     2. The perſons againſt whom this iudgement is threatned, are plainely ſet downe, Numb. 9.10, 13. Where we ſee, that if vrgent cauſes did hinder any one, God in that caſe did diſpenſe with him, but if when he might conueniently keepe the Paſſeouer, and was not hindered by the prouidence of God, he did then neglect it, then was he liable to this puniſhment.
                     We ſee therefore that the Iewes were bound in conſcience to the obſeruation of the Paſſeouer, as they alſo did, verſ. 28. and in times ſucceeding, when they were growne careleſſe, or had forgotten the ordinances of God, we ſee that godly Kings conſidering the great neceſſity of it, had great care to reſtore it to its former obſeruation; as Ioſiah and Hezekiah, 2. Chro. 30.
                     To apply this to our ſelues, ſeeing that there is as great neceſſity of our Sacraments, as of theſe of the Iewes, as great a penalty denounced againſt the wilfull contemuers and neglecters of ours, as of theirs, we haue as great need of theſe helpes as they, and as great benefit redounds to vs as to them, it followes that we are as ſtrictly bound vnto the obſeruation of the Sacraments as they were; and therefore we are not to think
                           •
                         it a matter arbitrary, and left at our choiſe, but to make conſcience to come, when God by his Miniſter doth inuite vs.
                     2. Againe, as here is condemned all wilfull profanation, and contempt of the Sacraments, ſo likewiſe is reproued that ſuperſtitious conceit that many haue of the neceſſity of it, who if they be ſicke, will haue the Sacrament brought to them, &amp;c.
                  
               
               
                  
                  AN EXPOSITION VPON THE THIRTIETH PSALME.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Pſal. 30.2.
                           In whoſe Spirit there is no guile.
                        
                     
                     GVile is a ſpirituall deceit, whereby a man deceiues himſelfe before God in the matter of his ſaluation.
                     The kinds of it may bee reduced to foure heads.
                     1. Guile, in reſpect of Gods fauour when a man is deceiued by a falſe perſwaſion, that he is in the fauour and loue of God. This is done three wayes:
                     1. By compariſons; when a man compares himſelfe either with himſelfe, or with groſſe notorious ſinners that come farre behind him in goodnes, or with ciuil righteous men. As did the Phariſes, Luk. 18.11, 12. ſuch are ſaid to bee aliue whithout the Law. Rom. 7.9.
                     2. By reaſon of temporall bleſſings, which becauſe a man doth enioy plentifully, ſo he ſtraightway concludes, that he is beloued of God.
                     3. Laſtly, which is the moſt fearefull, when men being puniſhed with croſſes and calamities, doe hereupon gather, that God loueth them, ſaying, that they haue their puniſhment here, and ſo they ſhall eſcape hereafter; though in the meane time they neuer repent of their ſinnes, and leaue their wicked courſes, for which end God did thus puniſh them.
                     2. Guile and deceit of the heart in reſpect of Sinne; this is either before or after the committing of it.
                     Before the committing of a ſinne, a mans hear
                           •
                         deceiues and beguiles him foure wayes.
                     
                        1. By perſwading him, it is but a ſmall veniall ſinne; ſo extenuating it, as a matter not much to be ſtood vpon.
                     2. But if the ſinne doe ſeeme great and vgly, then it labours to make him beleiue that God ſeeth it not, he takes no notice of it.
                     3. If this perſwaſion take no place, but that he thinke God will ſee it, then it ſuggeſteth vnto him that he will not puniſh him for it, he will paſſe by it, &amp;c.
                     4. If all this ſerue not the turne, then it perſwadeth him, that repentance may eaſily be had for it, that he will repent for it afore he dies, &amp;c.
                     After a ſinne committed, the guile is threefold.
                     1. A mans corrupt heart will endeuor to bring him to a loue and liking of that ſinne, and make it ſeeme pleaſant vnto him, that he may not repent for it.
                     Secondly, or elſe to cauſe him to defend it by colourable ſhiftes and excuſes, that he may ſeeme to doe it lawfully.
                     Thirdly, if it doe begin to gripe him, and to pricke his conſcience, then doth it labour to choke this griefe and ſorrow, and ſo to hinder ſound repentance, and that three wayes:
                     Firſt, by merriment, when a man thinkes it but a melancholy, and ſo gets him among merry companions to muſicke, and ſuch like, to driue it away.
                     Secondly, if ſo it leaue him not, then hee performes ſome ſhort humiliation for faſhion ſake, without true ſorrow indeed, that ſo hereby hee may as it were, get himſelfe out of Gods hands.
                     Thirdly, by ſome ceremony or other; as when ſome couetous extortioner that gets his goods vnlawfully, and neuer thinkes of reſtitution, vpon his death bed, or before, will giue ſomewhat to build an Almeſ-houſe, and ſo make amends for all. This is but a ceremony as it were.
                     3. Guile, in reſpect of vertues and graces, when a man deceiues him
                           •
                        elfe with a counterfeit ſhew of them; as
                     Firſt, when he perſwades himſelfe to be a true worſhipper of God, becauſe he frequents the places and exerciſes of his ſeruice.
                     
                        Secondly, to bee a true Chriſtian, becauſe he performes the outward duties of Religion.
                     Thirdly, when hee beguiles himſelfe with the ſhadow of Faith and repentance, and all other particular graces, whereof there is no one but may be counterefited.
                     Fourthly, guile in reſpect of the Word, and workes of the Spirit: for firſt, a man may haue, firſt, knowledge of the Word; ſecondly, aſſent vnto this knowledge; thirdly, a man may make profeſſion of it; fourthly, yea, he may ſtand for the defence of the truth thereof, and yet may he be beguiled with a falſe hope of his good eſtate; all things being wrought in him by that wonderfull power of God, whereby hee cauſeth euen the wicked and vngodly to giue teſtimony to the truth of his Word.
                     Secondly, there may bee wrought in him, firſt, a kind of loue and ioy in the Word; ſecondly, a willingneſſe to heare it; thirdly, a reformation of ſome ſinnes and corruptions in the life and conuerſation (which is done by the reſtraining, and not ſanctifying Spirit,) as there was in Herod, Mark. 6.20. with diuers the like graces; and neuertheleſſe as Herod did, he may nouriſh ſome one boſome ſinne, and ſo be farre from the ſtate of ſound conuerſion.
                     Diuers other ſuch deceits there are, but theſe are the principall: which things ſeeing they are ſo, and that the heart is deceitfull aboue all things, yea, and who can know it?
                     Let vs labour and learne, firſt, to ſuſpect our hearts, and not truſt them too farre, but by due examination find out the wiles and ſubtilties thereof. Secondly, to get vs ſincere and vpright hearts.

                           •
                        rall ground, the Apoſtle comes to ſome particular functions, or callings, and the duties belonging thereunto.
                     Hence wee learne this inſtruction from this, in that the Apoſtle ſtayeth not in the general duties of Chriſtianity; but from thence deſcendeth to the particular offices of ſuch generall callings: that it is not ſufficient to performe the generall duties of Chriſtianity, vnleſſe we practiſe the ſeuerall duties of our particular vocations, as the Apoſtle heerein is as carefull to ſet downe the one as the other, and to the Coloſſians the like, Chap. 4.5. And the Apoſtle Peter in his Epiſtle exhorts, and in the 2 Chap. ver. 15. of Titus, the Apoſtle ſhewes, that this is a thing that the Miniſters ought to teach the people, as is plain alſo in the 5 Commandement, in which euery one, is ranked into certaine degrees.
                     There are 4 conſiderations to ſtirre vs vp:
                     1 That thoſe ſeuerall places and callings wherein we are ſet, are appoynted of God, and that hee preſcribes the duties belonging vnto them.
                     2 That the particular callings wherein wee are ſet, ſerue to make vp the comlineſſe of the Church of God, and the beauty of the body of Chriſt Ieſus: now wee diſturbe this comely order, when we either exalt or debaſe our ſelfe too much, or liue out of our callings.
                     3 Theſe are the bonds whereby wee are bound and knit one to another, and by which wee both doe much good, and reape much profit one of another, Eph. 4.16.
                     4 That the generall duties of Chriſtianity cannot better be ſhewed, then in the practice of our particular duties of our ſeuerall callings.

                        .9, 10. heereby ſhall wee adorne the Goſpell of Chriſt in all things.
                     
                        And wee may well ſay without breach of charity, that they who are not carefull to performe the duties of particular callings, are no good Chriſtians, whatſoeuer ſhew they make abroad: as an vnconſcionable Miniſter in his calling, cannot poſſibly be a good Chriſtian.
                     2 Generall doctrine is, in that the Apoſtle doth make choice of thoſe callings that ſerue to build vp a family: all which in 3 ranks he reckoneth vp very acurately, and is very earneſt, copious and large in vrging the duties of them.
                     Hence wee learne, that the particular callings of a family are ſome of thoſe that belong to Chriſtians, and ſuch as in which wee ought to be diligent in ob
                           •
                        eruing the duties of them.
                     The reaſon is, becauſe the family is the ſeminary of the Church and Commonwealth, &amp; as it were the Beehiue, which heere and there ſendeth ſwarmes forth: So all men came firſt from the family of Adam and Eue; after the floud from the family of Noah: therefore great care is to be taken heerin, ſeeing in families all men are firſt trained vp, and ought ſo to be inſtructed, that they may be profitable members afterward of Church and Commonwealth.
                     Therefore thoſe that haue no other calling but onely of a family, ought not to be diſcomforted and troubled in conſcience, as if they had no calling at all, becauſe they haue no publike calling; but they ought to k
                           •
                        ow that ſuch callings are warranted by the Word of God, wherein they may haue buſines enough to imploy themſelues, if they be conſcionable in performance of it: 
                           •

                     2 For thoſe that haue another publike calling, to tell them, that by this, they are not exempted from the calling of the family: for the duties of the one doe not croſſe the other: as Ioſua was a captaine of the hoſt

                     Now from thoſe general doctrines, we come to handle the du

                        ies that belong to the particular callings heere mentioned: and firſt, to ſhew the duties 
                           •
                        o belong to man and wife.
                     Fitly doth the Apoſtle beginne with the married couple: 1 Becauſe in the beginning of the world, this was the firſt, as Adam and Eue were married and ioyned together by God, Gen. 2. before either ſeruants or children were any.
                     2 Becauſe they are the chiefe in the familie, hauing the gouernment thereof, and ſo are the guides and examples to others: and if they carry themſelues lewdly, their ſeruants and children will be ready to follow their examples. So then their fault is double. 1 In neglecting 
                           •
                        heir owne duties, and ſo wronging one another. 2 In giuing offence and ill example to others.
                     Now come we to the duties belonging to them, in which we will proceed in this order: 1 to lay downe the generall duties that belong to both.
                     2 To lay downe the ſeuerall duties of their particular callings.
                     The former are twofold, either

                     But in 1 Theſ. 4.4. of the chaſtity of the body. It is
twofold, either of 
                           ſingle life, &amp; this either of thoſe that were neuer married, or ſuch as are widdowes or widdowers. Of ſuch, 1 Tim. 5.16.
                           Married eſtates, Tit. 2.5.
                        
  This note againſt the dotage of Papiſts, who thinke that chaſtity and marriage cannot ſtand together, whereas the Apoſtle called the marriage bed vndefiled.
                     Now this is a mutuall duty to be performed of both. 1 Cor. 7.4. the man and the wife, neither of them haue more liberty than the other. It is alſo abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe adultery doth break the marriage bond, Pro. 2.17. Mat. 5.3

                        . Mat. 19.9. Where the exception ſheweth, that adultry breaketh this bond: ſo that if the man marry another, hee is not an adulterer.
                     Reaſon is euident, becauſe in adultery they make themſelues one fleſh with a ſtranger, 1 Cor. 6.16. Now this neer vnion can be but betwixt two. The vſe is therfore that we obſerue this cou

of another, 1 Pet. 3.7. 1 Cor. 7.12, 13. Where the Apoſtle vſeth an argument, which if it hold in thoſe marriages where one party is an Infidell, much more then where both are Chriſtians: and this was meant, Gen. 2. vlt. in that commandement, that a man ſhould leaue all, and cleaue to his wife: and this is the ground thereof. Reaſon is twofold, drawn partly from the benefits that come by Cohabitation, as, firſt becauſe all marriage duties are hereby better performed, loue increaſed and preſerued, the gifts and graces beſtowed on either of them ſhall be better obſerued, and ſo God ſhall be more prayſed and glorified, their affections more neerly knit together: for abſence doth alienate affectio
                           •
                        s, &amp;c.
                     Partly, from the hurts proceeding from the neglect thereof. 1 A neglect of the duties of marriage. 2 A hinderance of breeding and begetting holy ſeed. 3 A lying open to the ſnares and temptations of Satan, to many noyſome luſts, and occaſion of falling into adultery.
                     Now this is abſolutely neceſſary, 1 By conſequent, becauſe it giueth occaſion to adultery, wherby marriage is broken. 2 Simply in it ſelfe, in the vttermoſt extent. If it be an obſtinate, wilfull and finall deſertion, it doth directly breake the bond. But will ſome ſay, How ſhall we know whether it be ſuch a deſertion or no? We may know it by theſe two ſignes:
                     1 By the open profeſſion of the party forſaking: as if he be a Papiſt, &amp;c. and 
                           •

                     2 By the continuance in this ſeparation, as is further manifeſted by the comparing it with the ſtatutes of Colledges, from which i

Lawes of the Land haue determined vpon ſeuen yeeres abſence.
                     
                        Obiect. But there is nothing for which a man may put away his wife, or ſhee her husband, but onely for adultery, and ſo not for deſertion.
                     
                        Anſwer. Indeed nothing doth diſſolue the band by diuorce and putting away, but adultery, of which the places, Math. 5. Mat. 19. are to be vnderſtood: but yet beſides this, there are other cauſes whereby wedlocke is diſſolued: as namely death: and ſo alſo by deſertion: in which caſe vpon complaint, the Magiſtrate doth relieue the innocent party wronged.
                     
                        Queſt. Whether it be ſimply vnlawfull or no to be abſent for a time? No, if it be not in the vttermoſt extent: 2 If it be with mutuall conſent, 2 Kings 4.22. Pro. 7.19, 20. 3 If it be for weighty affaires, either for family or other occaſions by vertue of ones calling, as of Courtiers, Lawyers, Mariners, &amp;c. 4 If it be for an ineuitable impediment and neceſſity, as if a man be taken captiue, or the like.
                     But theſe cautions in all muſt be obſerued, that it be a departing with griefe and ſorrow, euen as if it were a pulling of one member from another. 2 That there be a returne againe ſo ſpeedily as poſsibly they may▪ and laſtly, in the time of their abſence, to ſupply their preſence by frequent intercourſe of letters, ſending tokens of mutuall loue, and enquiring of one anothers wellfare, &amp;c.
                     From hence wee may learne, firſt, the erronious opinion of the Canoniſts, that hold that there is nothing that doth breake the band, neither adultery, nor deſertion: yet they hold many cauſes of ſeparation from bed and boord: ſo the band ſhall remaine, yet they ſhall haue no meanes of performance of marriage duties.
                     2 This condemnes them that thinke themſelues neuer well and merry, but in the abſence one of another: as they that

This good ſtandeth in foure things. 1 In the ſoule. 2 In the body. 3 In the goods. 4 In the good name of one another: in which the good or ill of one another doth conſiſt: for all together, this is a generall meanes to be vſed, namely, Faithfull and daily prayer one for ano

And this muſt be done both inwardly by themſelues in their ſecret prayers, and alſo one with another. So Iſaac is ſaid to haue prayed with or before his wife, Gen. 25.
                     1 For the ſoule: either to winne them and conuert them; or to build them vp further being conuerted: For the former, ſee 1 Peter 3.1. 1 Cor. 7. The reaſon is, becauſe this bond is not onely, and ſo much for carnall reſpects, as indeed for the good of the ſoule: as for this reſpect, they are called the bonds of miniſtration.
                     And this is not only between thoſe where one party is an Infidell, but alſo if he be a prophane perſon and not yet called.
                     For the latter, namely, edifying of one another, this muſt be done. 1 By remoouing the impediments which may hinder this ſpirituall edification, the greateſt of which is ſinne; wherefore we muſt watch one ouer another for the auoyding of ſinne.
                     This watchfulneſſe ſhewes it ſelfe a waies: 1 preuenting of a ſinne, if we ſee them purpoſed to commit any, as Rebecca did preuent Iſaac in bleſſing Eſau, which if according to his purpoſe he had done, hee had ſinned. 2 In redreſſing of any thing that is out of ord

                     This ſerues to reprooue the vnnaturalneſſe of thoſe that grudge one another things conuenient in any ſickneſſe, &amp;c. The husbands complaining of great charges, the wiues of their labor and paines: and ſo making their afflictions more h

                     Of this ſo let vs be perſwaded, that when God laies the croſſe vpon one, God layeth it vpon the other, for the tryall of their patience.
                     4 Concerning the good name one of another, that the good name of the one ought to bee as deare vnto the other as their owne name.
                     Such a care had Ioſeph of Maries good name, Mat. 1.19. And ſo Bathſheba was in the 2 Sam. 11.5. carefull for Dauids credit.
                     
                        For▪ 
                        Pro. 22.1. Eccleſ. 7.3. A good name is better then riches, then life, yea, then any thing elſe.
                     Againe, how will this knit their hearts together, when they perceiue each other care for the credit one of another, as the contrary bringeth heart-burning, contention, iealouſie, and debate betweene them?
                     For the performance heereof, theſe 4 things are to be marked.
                     1 To haue a care to preuent an ill name: in which, we muſt haue reſpect to theſe 3 eſpeciall things.
                     1 What the wife doth relate of the husband, or he of her.
                     2 What they doe heare; to take heed of their eares.
                     3 To take heed to their iudgements, what cenſure they giue of it.
                     For the firſt, that they diuulge not their infirmities, 1 Pet. 4.8. but couer and hide them as Ioſeph did. This condemnes thoſe that diſcouer and lay open their husbands and wiues imperfections; which fault is ſo much the greater in theſe two reſpects.
                     1 Becauſe theſe two being ſo neerly linked together, doe know more by one another, than any other, and ſo if theſe blaze their imperfections abroad, it is a moſt foule fault.
                     2 B
                           •
                        cauſe of all, they are moſt bound to ſeeke the credit one of another: For the bond betweene man and wife is more neere than betweene father and ſonne, as appeares, Gen. 2.24. So that if Cham were curſed for diſcouering his fathers fault, much more ſhall ſuch a husband or wife be accurſed, that lay open the infirmities one of another.
                     2 For our eares, that they be not open to receiue newes and tales one of another, that our eares be not ready and willing, itching to heare falſe rumors and ſurmiſes. Our iudgement muſt be very ſparing or very charitable: that we ſuſpend our iudgement, and not ſtraightway raſhly giue our cenſure, as Ioſeph by all likelihood did of Mary:
                        
otherwiſe there will be many euill ſurmiſes, iealouſies, and ſuſpitions.
                     Or if wee giue our cenſure, it muſt be in loue: the properties whereof, the Apoſtle ſetteth down, 1 Cor. 13.7, 8. either that we int

                        pentance; if vpon ſuſpicion, that hee may be warned to preuent it.
                     3 For the procuring of a good name: that they gladly report and diuulge their good parts, as the husband of that good wife, Pro. 
                        
                           •
                        1, 28. and willingly to heare the good report one of another.
                     4 For the preſeruing of a good name, they muſt, if they heare a good report of one another, giue notice thereof to each other, not to glory in it themſelues, and to be proud of it, but to glorifie God for it.
                     For the manifeſtation of this care, this muſt bee vſed, viz. that both reioyce and grieue mutually, for the good or ill name one of another, by which ſimpathy and fellow feeling our loue and care of one anothers credit will plainely ſhew it ſelfe.
                     4 Concerning the goods of one another, that as they h

                     Now generally, if all theſe duties were performed,

how comfortable, peaceable, and ioyous would the band of marriage be, which wee ſee many by neglecting the performance thereof, to make moſt weariſome, and burdenſome? ſo that after a while, the

                                             Loue,
                                             Care,
                                          
                                       
                                       both to others, as the care of the worſhip of God in the family, &amp;c.

                     The Apoſtle doth beginne with wiues, as hee doth in the Epiſtle to the Coloſsians, &amp;c. And ſo Saint Peter.
                     
                     The reaſon of it is, becauſe ſhee is the inferiour, and it is the Apoſtles order, to beginne alwaies with the duties of inferiour, and ſo is this order obſerued in the 5 Commandement: But what is the reaſon of this? Two there are:
                     1 Becauſe the inferiour is the lother to ſubiect himſelfe to his place, not that that is a matter of greater difficulty to obey, than gouerne; for this thing is farre more d

                     2 Becauſe it will fare worſe with inferiours, if there be ſtrife, who ſhall beginne: for whence ariſeth rage and anger in the ſuperiour? Is it not becauſe of the ſtubbornneſſe of in
                           •
                        eriours? Whereas the beſt way for inferiours, to mooue thoſe that are in places of authority ouer them, is to vſe them mildly and gently, and not churliſhly, yea, to winne them to the performing of their owne duties, is firſt, to beginne with duty, and to behaue themſelues obediently, and reuerently. Indeed both ought to prouoke by good example, not ſt
                           •
                        y till they be prouoked, and to ſtriue to goe before the other in performing of their duties; and this is praiſe-worthy: But generally, if there be any contention about beginning, the inferiour muſt beginne: And in the caſe of wiues, there be ſome reaſons ſpeciall why they ſhould beginne.
                     1 Out of 1 Corinth. 11.9.
                     2 Out of 1 Tim. 2.14. Becauſe ſhe was firſt in the tranſgreſsion, and ſo ought by her obedience recompence the wrong ſhee hath done vnto her husband; by being firſt in obedience.
                     Now let's conſider why the Apoſtle firſt beginnes with wiues amongſt all other degrees of inferiours: For why is the wife as loth to performe the duties of

ſubiection, as other ſorts of inferiours are? yea ſurely, and the reaſon is, becauſe of all inequalities, there is the l
                           •
                        aſt diſparity in this, between man and wife. Though ſhee be not the head, yet ſhe is the heart. See 1 Cor. 
                        
                           •
                        1.11, 12. ſo that there is a moſt neere relation: yea a common 
                           •
                        quity in many things with their husbands: and ſo in ſome things there is an equality; but yet for all this, to conclude as women do, that ſo there is an equality in all, is but a womans reaſon, &amp;c.
                     Againe, euen in thoſe things wherein there is a community, yet is there an inequality, as in commanding of their children: if the father command a thing indifferent, and the mother forbid, the fathers word ought to ſtand.
                     Againe, in ſome things there is no equality: as the husband may command the wife, but ſhee by no meanes her husband.
                     Now becauſe of this little diſparity, it is; that wiues of all other inferiours, are moſt hardly drawne to ſubiect themſelues obediently.
                     This ſerues for the praiſe of thoſe wiues, that haue ſo farre ſubdued their nature, as to yeeld willing obedience.
                     2 To reproue them that labour not againſt this corruption of nature, but rather increaſe and nouriſh the ſame by their wilfull peruerſeneſſe.
                     Now, from theſe Generalities, come we to the particular duties belonging to each of them in ſeuerall.

                        cauſe God hath ſet them ouer them: and this is the ſubiection here meant, that wiues performe vnto th
                           •
                        ir husbands.

                           usbands: (
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                        ▪) which words containe two things. 1 That wiues ought to haue but one husband, 1 Cor. 7.2. 2 That this ſubiection is to be performed to him alone, forbidding all ſubmiſsion to adulterers, &amp;c. Commanding chaſte and faithfull obedience vnto him.
                     
                        As vnto the Lord,) that is, to Chriſt Ieſus: for this word is by a kind of excellency appropriated vnto him, and it is ſo expounded in the 5 verſe of the next Chap. Theſe words teach vs two things. 1 That the husband by vertue of his place, hath a kinde of fellowſhip with Chriſt.
                     2 That ſuch a ſubmiſsion is to be performed by the wife to her husband, as ſhee would performe vnto Chriſt. That is, 1 That it be done reuerently, in feare and trembling. 2 Sincerely, in ſingleneſſe of heart, as is ſaid of ſeruants, Chap. 6.5, 6.
                     
                        For the huſband is the wiues head.) This is metaphorically ſpoken, in alluſion to a naturall body, that is, the husband, by reaſon of his place, is more eminent, he is to protect, to defend, and gouerne his wife.
                     
                        Euen as Chriſt is the head of the Church,) To vrge and preſſe the husbands authority ouer the wife, hee putteth in this ſimilitude betwixt the husband and Chriſt; wherein we may conſider two things. 1 That

the husband, by verue of his place, is abo
                           •
                        e his wife. 2 That heerein there is a reſemblance between him and Chriſt, both which ought duely to be obſerued, becauſe they are ſtrong motiues to ſtirre vp wiues to yeeld obedience to their husbands.
                     
                        And the ſame is the Sauiour of his body,) that is, Chriſt is not onely a head to rule, to giue ſpirituall life, ſenſe and motion to his members, but (himſelfe) and no other is alſo the (Sauiour) abſolute and euery way perfect, (
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ,) to protect, defend, and ſaue his (body) that is, the Elect, Gods children, ſuch as God hath giuen to him.
                     
                        Therefore as, &amp;c.) This concluſion inferred vpon the former ground, ſheweth two things, 1 That there is as great reaſon that the wife ſhould ſubiect her ſelfe to her husband, as that the Church ſhould ſubmit her ſelfe to Chriſt. 2 That ſuch a ſubiection as the Church doth performe to Chriſt, ſuch ought the wife to performe to her husband; that it be done cheerefully, readily, conſtantly, and ſo in other things agreeably.
                     
                        Ob. Why, but will ſome man ſay, is any man to be obeyed ſo as Chriſt is obeyed.
                     
                        Anſw. We muſt reſtraine this and ſuch like generalities to the point in queſtion; and then wee ſhall ſee the meaning to be this, that in euery thing, which doth belong to the husband by Vertue of his place, to command, therein ought the wife to obey, euen as the Church obeyeth Chriſt. Like as it is ſaid, 1 Cor. 10.23. All things are lawfull for mee, that is, all things indifferent: as alſo. 1 Cor. 6.13.
                     Hence wee may learne two things. 1 That the authority of the husband is very ample and large. 2 That the wife muſt looke vnto all duties of obedience, and not onely to ſome, ſaying as ſome doe, I will obey my husband in theſe and theſe, but not in others.
                     More diſtinctly to ſpeake of them, we may conſider in theſe words, two parts. 1 The duty it ſelfe, and this,
                     
                        1 Wherein it conſiſteth, viz. In Subiection.
                     2 To whom to be performed, namely, to their owne husbands.
                     3 How to be performed. The manner is threefold. 1 As to the Lord. 2 As the Church to Chriſt. 3 In euery thing.
                     2 The reaſon of this duty, taken from the authority and place, wherein God hath placed the man. The husband is the head, which is amplified by a ſimilitude betweene Chriſt and him.
                     1 Dutie is Subiection, which is a generall duty commended in Gen. 3.16. For wee muſt thinke that this is not a iudgement onely, but alſo a commandement, as the iudgement vpon Adam, of eating his bread in the ſweat of his browes, was alſo a commandement that he ſhould not liue without a calling, Gen. 3.19. And from this ground, the Apoſtles and Prophets haue raiſed this doctrine of the wiues ſubmiſsion, that wee ſtand not to recite all the places ſeuerally.
                     This word (ſubiect,) is of large extent, as the word honour is in the 5 Commandement. It implyeth two branches of duties. 1 That ſhe acknowledge and yeeld vnto her husband by reaſon of his place, the prerogatiue of eminency, and ſuperiority aboue her ſelfe. 2 That accordingly ſhe reſpect him.
                     The firſt that is, That ſhe doe ſee and acknowledge a ſuperiority in her husband, is not only a maine duty, but alſo indeed the ground of all other. For how can the wife ſubiect her ſelfe willingly, if ſhee neuer acknowledge any preeminency, and authority ouer her in her husband? Well may ſhee yeeld a forced ſubmiſsion, euen as a conquered King may ſubmit himſelfe to the conquerour, though hee account him not his ſuperiour, but in his heart deſpiſeth him, and ſeeketh opportunity of reuenge: but a willing and ready ſubmiſſion ſhe can neuer performe.
                     Now that wiues ought to knowledge ſuch a ſuperiority

in their husbands: 1 See Gen. 3.16. 2 Let them obſerue the Titles God giues them in Scripture: as of Lord, Gen. 18.12. 1 Peter 3.6. Hoſ. 2.16. Guide, Pro. 2.17. Head, as heere, Image and glory of God, 1 Cor. 11.7.
                     3 Euen nature ſheweth this, that women are alwaie
                           •
                         couered in token of ſubiection; whereof alſo their long hayre is a ſigne, 1 Cor. 11.
                     4 The husband by reaſon of his place, repreſents the comely order and beauty in a naturall body, viz. That he is the head. So, &amp;c. And alſo he represents the perſon of Chriſt.
                     5 The woman was made for the man: ſhee was made after the man, ſhe was made not of the mans head, but out of his ſide: all which ſhew the ſuperiority of her husband.
                     Wee ſee then, that ſubiection is a neceſſary duty to be performed by wiues: yea, of whatſoeuer ſtate or degree ſhee was before her marriage, yet muſt ſhe, though a Queen, &amp;c. but married to a meane ſubiect, after her marriage acknowledge her ſelfe inferiour to him, though for her Regiment and the like ſhe may be his ſuperiour.
                     
                        Vſe Is firſt, to teach wiues, that they be diligent to learn this duty, &amp; for to attaine to the right knowledge, and acknowledging of their husbands prerogatiues.
                     2 To condemne ambitious and proud wiues, that will forſooth be not onely equall, but aboue their husbands: whence ariſe ſo many contentions in families.
                     The ſecond that is, Wiuely reſpect conſiſts in two things.
                     
                        1 Reuerence.
                        2 Obedience.
                     
                     Reuerence is either inward or outward. Inward in the heart, when the wife doth eſteeme her husband in reſpect of his place, worthy of honour; which duty, in the laſt verſe of this 5. Chapter is called Feare. Not ſlauiſh and ſeruile, but ioyned with loue, when ſhe

grieueth if he be diſpleaſed, &amp; reioiceth, if ſhe can at any time giue him contentment. The married wife careth how ſhe may pleaſe her husba
                           •
                        d, 1 Cor. 7.34. It is ſuch an eſteeme, as the Church carrieth of Chriſt, who we ſee, Cant. 5. how ſhee was grieued, and could not be at reſt when ſhe had once loſt him.
                     This is layd downe vnto vs, by the example of Sarah. For if wee compare, 1 Pet. 3.6. with Gen. 18.12. wee ſhall finde, that that which is ſet downe as her word, was onely the thought of her heart.
                     Now this duty is another ground of the good performance of all other duties; without this, they will be but fained, and hypocriticall: for as the former duty ſerued to informe the iudgement in a right apprehenſion of that ſuperiority God hath layd on husbands; ſo this ſerues to rectifie the heart and affections, that ſincerely and vnfainedly they may honour and reuerence them.
                     The want of this feare and reuerence, is the cauſe that we ſee many, who of others are much regarded and honored for their good gifts, which are more eminent &amp; openly knowne, are yet for ſome hidden infirmities, whereunto their wiues are moſt priuy, very vilely, and baſely eſteemed of them. For redreſſe whereof, wiues ought,
                     1 More to regard that place wherein their husbands are ſet, in which they doe ſuſtaine the perſon of Chriſt, then to looke vpon their perſons, to conſider them as their husbands, and not as men.
                     2 To bee more carefull to looke vnto their better parts.
                     3 To interprete all things in the better part, to couer and hide their infirmities, and to labour to amend them.
                     4 To weigh their owne infirmities.
                     Theſe conſiderations will root out that vile eſteeme many beare towards their husbands, and plant in ther

hearts an honourable reſpect and reuerence of them.
                     Outward Reuerence conſiſts in two things. 1 A reuerent behauiour, and carriage. 2 In reuerent ſpeech: The reuerence is commended vnto wiues by the example of Rebecca, Gen. 24.64, 65. and expreſly commanded, 1 Cor. 
                        
                           •
                        1.10. 1 Pet. 3.2.
                     Now this outward carriage conſiſts in three poynts. 1 Sober behauiour. 2 Courteous geſture. 3 Modeſt attyre.
                     Sobriety, as it is a vertue eſpecially belonging to all women, ſo moſt eſpecially to wiues; and it is oppoſed to Leuity and Wantonneſſe: for as this vaine and light carriage betokens a light eſteeme that wiues haue of their husbands, ſo the other is a ſpeciall manifeſtation of inward feare and reuerence. See Titus 2.4. This is not oppoſed to Matrimoniall familiarity: ſuch as was betweene Iſaac and Rebecca, Gen. 26.8. but ſuch ſporting ought, 1 To be in priuate, when they are alone. 2 It ought to be begun by the husband, as it is there ſaid, that (Iſaac) ſported with Rebecca. 3 That in companie they doe abſtaine.
                     2 Courteſie and obeyſance: not as children and ſeruants for euery light occaſion, for heerein a difference is to be put, conſidering, that of all inequality, there is leaſt diſparity betweene the husband and wife. This ſo muſt be ſhewed when there ſhall be a departing one from the other for a ſeaſon, or a comming home, or at the ſitting downe at table, or when the wife maketh ſome ſolemn requeſt vnto her husband: as Bathſheba did vnto Dauid, 1 King. 1.16, 31. Some may ſay, that Dauid was a King, and ſo ſhe reuerenced him as King, &amp; not as her husband. But I anſwer, 1 that though Dauid were a King, yet was ſhe a Kings wife, and ſo dignified with the Titles and Honors of a Queene; and if ſhe notwithſtanding would doe it, much more ought others. 2 That if on the contrary, Vaſhties ſtoutneſſe were cenſured as an ill example to all wiues, Eſter 1.17. Why

ſhould not this that was well performed by Bathſheba, be a good example to others to doe the like?
                     This is alſo commended vnto vs by the example of Rebecca, lighting downe from her horſe to meete Iſaac, Gen. 24.64. and of Abigail to Dauid.
                     
                     3 Modeſty, eſpecially in apparell, which is a very ſingular manifeſtation of the inward reuerence and honor they doe carry towards their husbands: And it is, th
                           •
                        t they be ſo attired, as neither by coſtlineſſe nor curiouſneſſe of faſhion, they exceed the ſtate and calling of their husbands. It is commanded to all women in generall, 1 Tim. 2.9. So is it particularly applyed to wiues, 1 Pet. 3.3. Heere are condemned thoſe proud Dames, that will goe fine and in the faſhion, though their husbands goe neuer ſo plainely: which ſhewes that there is no care to honour their husbands; for euen their example ſhould teach them otherwiſe.
                     Now come we to the ſecond branch, which is Reuerent Speech, which muſt be anſwerable to their carriage, manifeſting a humble ſubiection in themſelues, and ſuperiority in their huſbands: and it is either in Preſence, to their husbands, or in Abſence, to others concerning their husbands. In the preſence of their husbands, their ſpeeches and words muſt be, 1 Few. 2 Meeke and Gentle. Fewneſſe of words; that they ſtriue not to haue all the talke, to begin and end, to take the tale out of their husbands mouth, &amp;c. See for this ſilence, 1 Tim. 2.11, 12. 1 Cor. 14.34, 35. where the Apoſtle ſaith, that the woman muſt learne of her husband. Now, a learner muſt keepe ſilence: and ſilence is commanded vnto women not onely in the congregation, but alſo in the family. What then, muſt they be mute? No: ſilence is not oppoſed to ſpeech, but to loquacity, when they muſt haue all the talke. This condemnes many wiues, whoſe tongues neuer lye ſtill, &amp;c.
                     Meekneſſe and Mildeneſſe of ſpeech is ſhewed, 1 In Titles: all their compellations giuen to their husbands,

muſt ſauour of reuerence. Sarah was well inured and accuſtomed to this, that euen in her heart, alone by her ſelfe, when ſhee might haue ſtiled her husband otherwiſe, without any diſgrace to him, yet ſhee calleth him Lord, Gen. 18.12. Onely let Chriſtians take heed, that they auoyde ſingularity heerein, as in calling their husbands Head, or Guide, &amp;c. but let them vſe ſuch Titles of reuerence, as are vſual &amp; proper to our toungs. I do not altogether condemne thoſe that call their huſbands by their Surnames: as Maſter ſuch a one, &amp;c. But ſuch are to be condemned, as call them by their Chriſten names; as Iohn, Will, Tom, &amp;c. which indeed are, and ought to be vſed towards them onely that are inferiours. 2 Thoſe that giue them vaine and fooliſh names of their owne deuiſing: as chicke, pigge, &amp;c. What reuerence is there in theſe ſpeeches?
                     For the manner of ſpeech, either in approuing, or reprouing any thing; they may not directly command their husbands, but intreate: nor reproue with chiding and anger, but gently by exhortation, auoyding vnaduiſed and raſh ſpeech: as that of Rahel to Iacob, Gen. 30.1. angerly and ſhrewiſh ſpeech: as, Iezabel to Ahab, 1 King. 2.17. Bitter and rayling ſpeech: as that of Zipporah to Moſes, Exod. 4.25. Scoffing and frumping: as Michol to Dauid, 2 Sam. 6.20. Diſdainfull and reprochfull ſpeeches: as Iobs wife, Iob. 2.9. Shee muſt not giue word for word. All theſe are implyed by Saint Peter, 1 Pet. 3.4. vnder the name of a meeke and quiet ſpirit: a thing much ſet by of God.
                     This therefore is to be obſerued, becauſe that wiues being the weaker veſſell, are more ſubiect to choller, and raſh vnaduiſed anger. 2 Becauſe that this fault in them is double. 1 The diſtemper of affections in themſelues. 2 The neglecting of their husbands place.
                     2 In their abſence, to others concerning their huſbands, they ought ſo to ſpeake of them, as they may ſhew their reuerence and honour to them, as Sarah did

alone in her heart, as the Church in the 5. of the Cant. ver. 10. highly extolleth her husband Chriſt, vnto thoſe that ſhee meeteth. So doth Mary ſpeake concerning Ioſeph: Thy father and I, putting him in the firſt place, Luke 2.48.
                     Now this ought to bee obſerued of women, when they meet together, becauſe then, commonly their talk is of their husbands.
                     So much for Reuerence. The ſecond branch is Obedience: and this is that which tryes their religion, whether they ſubiect themſelues to the word of God or no: for the other duties ſtand more in contemplation, and acknowledgement, and ſo may be more eaſily performed.
                     This duty is layd downe in the Law of the woman, Gen. 3.16. (whereunto wee muſt alwaies haue an eye) which ſaith, Ty deſire ſhall be ſubiect to thine huſband, and he ſhall rule ouer thee: therefore it followes, that ſhee muſt obey: and by the example of Sarah, 1 Pet. 3.6. And the compariſon betweene the wife and the Church enforceth this. Laſtly, the woman promiſes the ſame at her marriage.
                     More particularly, let vs conſider three poynts.
                     1 The kindes of obedience.
                     2 The manner of performing them.
                     3 The extent, how farre forth obedience is to bee yeelded.
                     For the firſt, it ſtands in two poyntes.
                     1 That the wife abſtaine to doe any thing of her owne head, and after her owne minde, eyther without or againſt the conſent of her husband. 2 That ſhe performe that which he willeth her to doe.
                     
                        Conſent of the husband is twofold, eyther expreſſe, or implicit. Expreſſe, by writing, ſpeaking, or other ſignification of his minde vnto her. And this is eyther Generall, or Speciall. Generall, when without a diſtinct reſtraint to this or that thing, the huſband giues

h
                           •
                        r liberty to doe what ſhee thinkes beſt: as when a Miniſter, or other man is occupied in ſome publike calling, commits vnto his wife the care, and managing of all his houſhold affaires: Such a generall conſent had Ioſeph, of whom his Maſter tooke account of nothing. ſaue of the bread hee did eate, Gen. 39.6. And the like when hee was mad
                           •
                         ruler of Aegypt, Gen. 41.40. The ſame alſo had the good wife, Prou. 31. In whom becauſe the heart of her husband t
                           •
                        uſted, that is, iudged her faithfull, truſt
                           •
                        , and dilig
                           •
                        nt for the procuring of his wealth, verſe 11. therefore hee commits all vnto her, ſhe buies, ſhe ſels, ſhee doth all, ver. 16, &amp;c.
                     Particular conſent is for one, or ſome particular actions, as Hannah had for not going with her husband at that time, 1 Sam. 1.22, 23. and Sarah againſt her maid Agar, Gen. 16.6. for power and authority to correct her, but for that manner ſhe did it in.
                     Implicit conſent and by conſequence. 1 By Silence, when the husband hearing and knowing of the matter, may if he will, hinder it, and yet doth not, as in the caſe of Vowes, Numb. 
                        
                           •
                        0.8, 9. 2 That which the wife gathers by the minde, former carriage, and diſpoſition of her husband; as if a woman in her husbands abſence, doe relieue a man in diſtreſſe and miſery, whom ſhee knowes, if h
                           •
                        r husband himſelfe were preſent, would ſuccour and relieue, and by this his good minde, ſhee is perſwaded that he is willing ſhee ſhould doe it. So Hannah, in vowing her childe vnto God, 1 Sam. 1.11. had the implicit conſent of her hu
                           •
                        band, becauſe ſhee knew that Elkanah being a religious man, would conſecrate vnto God that childe, which hee ſhould haue in his old age.
                     So then, if the wife doe any thing without the expreſſe, or implicit conſent of her husband, ſhe breakes the rule and Law of Obedience.
                     Now againſt Conſent, is when the husband forbiddeth it and diſclaimes it, and yet ſhe will doe it. A

thing ſimply to bee condemned.
                     This may be further amplified by ſome particulars: as, 1 in diſpoſing of the goods of the family: Wherein ſhee hath not liberty to doe what ſhee will: but theſe goods are two-fold, either proper, or common. Proper goods are ſuch as the wife hath a property and right, not only in the vſe, but in the poſſeſsion of them; and they are either ſuch as the husband before his marriage bindes himſelfe by obligation, eyther vpon his own voluntary motion, or by the perſwaſion of friends to giue vnto her, to be diſpoſed at her owne minde and pleaſure: or ſuch as he husband in kindneſſe after their marriage giues vnto his wife; as the rent of ſuch a houſe or field, or the like. In all theſe it's left to the wiues liberty to doe therewith what ſhee pleaſeth, and not what her husband would haue her.
                     For goods that are common, which come eyther by the wife or by the husband; the property, right, and poſſeſsion belongs onely to the husband, the wife hath onely the vſe of them and no more. Therefore doth Iacob call that riches which hee had with his wiues, his riches, Gen. 31.37. and though his wiues called their goods, our goods; yet this prooues not that it was theirs for poſſeſsion, but only for vſe: and againe, this is ſpoken not in oppoſition to their husband, but in oppoſition to Laban their fath
                           •
                        r, that it was none of his. And hence it is, that we neuer read in Scripture, the wife called rich, but onely the husband. This is alſo proued by that law among the Iſraelites, that no inheritrix, or daughter heire might marry to one of another tribe, becauſe then the inheritance was to goe away from the wife, to the husband: as the example of the daughters of Zelophehad, Numb. 36.6, 8. And the Law of our Land ſheweth it, ſaying, that the woman is vnder couert baron, and therefore ſhe may not giue, ſell, buy, or borrow without her husband conſent to it, for otherwiſe her huſband may reuoke all againe.
                     
                        But heere ſome caſes of conſcience are briefely to be decided:
                     1 Whether the wife may not relieue the poore Saints in diſtreſſe without her husbands conſent?
                     
                        Anſw. She may not, becauſe her husbands goods are not hers to giue away. Yea, but it is to a good end. Well, but a good end cannot iuſtifie a bad action; and indeed children that are vnder the gouernment of their parents, may as well doe it, ſteale away from them, and giue it to the poore: and if good ends may ſerue the turne, then coozeners and fraudulent perſons that get their goods by deceit, &amp;c. may be excuſed, if they ſay they doe it to a good end: as to build an Hoſpitall▪ and ſuch like. Wee muſt ſo follow Chriſts rule, bidding vs to giue of that which wee haue, Luke 11.41. That obiection out of Luke 8.3. is nothing: for there indeed it is ſaid, that Ioanna Chuzas wife, miniſtred to Chriſt; but it is not ſaid that ſhee did it without the conſent of her husband, for then Chriſt would not haue ſuffered it.
                     
                        Ob. But what if the husband be a profane hard-hearted mercileſſe man, that will giue nothing to the poore, and ſhee bee pittifull and compaſsionate towards them?
                     
                        Anſw. Her hands in this caſe alſo are tyed, ſhe may not giue, no more than a ſonne that being of diſcretion, and deſirous to relieue the poore, may take away any thing of his fathers goods. Her honeſt heart, her griefe that ſhee cannot doe it, her deſire and willing minde to relieue them, ſhall be accepted of God for the deed it ſelfe. But herein the husbands fault is doubled. 1. The neglect of charity in himſelfe. 2 That he tyes his wifes hands, and hinders her from doing the good ſhe deſireth, and ſo euen cauſes her to cry vnto God againſt him.
                     
                        Obiect. 2 What if the husband bee childiſh, ſottiſh, and fooliſh, and haue ſuch naturall infirmities,

                        r husband and family, 1 Sam. 25.18, 19. This was a caſe of neceſsitie, and a ſeruant might haue done it: Iuſt as wee ſee in a great fire, a man puts downe another mans houſe, and carries away his goods to ſaue it from the fire.
                     Heere there is a generall direction for wiues in this matter, that what a ſonne, who is vnder the gouernment of his parents, may doe in this ca
                           •

                           •
                        t the wife plead that ſhee brought maintenance with her, and therefore ſhee may doe what ſhee liſt; but ſhe muſt conſider the ſubiection that God hath laid vpon her, and that now her goods are not her owne, but her husbands: And though they be yoke-fellowes, yet it is in familiarity, not in authority.
                     Now then, what vnnaturall wiues are they that ſteale a

                           •
                        ipping, in following the faſhion, and fine fare, &amp;c? Hereby they 1. breake the Commandement: 2. They ill 
                           •
                        epay their husbands labour and paines, and ſo reward euill for good. 3. They impoueriſh their husbands eſtate, it decayes they know not how: when the yeere

comes about, the
                           •
                        r gaines are gone, and conſumed as the dew before the Sunne. 4. They ſhew themſelues to be arrant theeues, ſo much more worſe than other, becauſe greater truſt is put in them than in other, &amp; therefore the deceit is the greater: as, Prou. 28.24. 5. They are ill examples to thoſe that are vnder them, to doe the like, and indeed commonly they vſe their ſeruants helpe in this dealing.
                     2 Another particular, wherein ſhee muſt haue her husbands conſent, is in intertaining of gueſts: if ſhee haue a deſire to bring in gueſts, ſhe muſt make it known to her husband, as the Shunamite, 2 King. 4.9. The reaſon is, becauſe wiues know not their husbands eſtate; and ſo hereby he may be burdened. Which condemnes thoſe wiues that will feaſt and entertaine gueſts in their husbands abſence. A note of a light houſwife, Pro. 7.19.
                     2 Such as will ſend their meate out a dores, to their companions and goſſips, yea, though it be to neuer ſo good company. Laſtly, ſuch as will haue it in their huſbands preſence, but how? It muſt be as they liſt, or elſe the houſe will be too little for them.
                     3 Concerning children, and the diſpoſing of them
                           •
                         as firſt in giuing of the name, they cannot do it without the allowance of their husbands. Leah and Rahel gaue names to their children, Gen. 29. and 30. but it is probable they had their husbands conſent, as may appeare alſo for that Iacob changed the name of one, when Rahel had giuen him a name without his cōſent, Gē. 35.18. So in the naming of Iohn, when his mother had giuen him the name, yet did not this ſatisfie them, but they would haue him name him, Luke 1.60.62, 2. For appoynting of the Calling, manner of education, marriage, &amp;c. as Rebbeca did, Gen. 27.43. compared with 46. ver. and the beginning of the 28. Chap. and Hannah, 1 Sam. 1.22▪ and ſo likewiſe for the apparelling of the child, maintenance, and giuing of portions. This condemnes thoſe

wiues that cocker their children, and will not let them be at the husbands diſpoſing, and to be in ſuch places as hee ſees fit for them.
                     4 Concerning ſeruants, in taking them in, putting them away, imploying them in buſineſſe, whether they be prentizes in the ſhop, or other, as labouring men in the field, &amp;c. The Shunamite asked leaue of her huſband to take one of her ſeruants with her, 2 King. 4.22. Sarah thurſt not Hagar out a doores of her ſelfe, Gen. 21.10. Neither hath ſhee command ouer her husbands beaſts, his horſes, &amp;c. to runne and ride whither ſhee liſt, as appeares by that example of the Shunamite, 2 Kings 4.22.
                     This condemnes ſuch as will haue their ſeruants alwaies at cōmand, to go with them about their buſineſſe, though their husband haue neuer ſo much need of them. 2 Such ſhrewiſh wiues as will change their ſeruants when they liſt, againſt their husbands conſent.
                     5 Touching their owne goings abroade, that they gadde not vp and downe at their owne pleaſure, 1 Tim. 5.13. A fault of a Leuites wife, Iudg. 19.2. A note of a whore, Prou. 7.11, 12.
                     6 Concerning vowes, that ſhee be not raſh in binding her ſelfe without his conſent and agreement: for this the Scripture is plaine, Numb. 30.9. Hannah in vowing her ſonne to God, had the implicit conſent of her husband, 1 Sam. 1.11.
                     Theſe duties thus warranted from the example of holy women in Scripture, are ſound and ſtrong arguments to enforce the like duties vpon all women, vnleſſe wee deny the Apoſtles argument from the example of Sarah, 1 Peter 3.6. So much for the negatiue part of obedience; The affirmatiue or actiue part followeth, and that is twofold: in regard of his

                           1 Commandement,
                           2 Reproofe.
                        
                     
                     For the former, the duty is▪ that ſhe yeeld to do what

he willeth &amp; requireth: which duty is laid downe in the Command
                           •
                        ment, Gen. 3.16. and further proued by the compariſon betweene the woman and the Church. Let wiues obſerue firſt the genera
                           •
                        l rule, viz. That they ſubiect their iudgement and will, vnto their husbands iudgement and will; obeying them in tho
                           •
                        e things which to their owne iudgement ſeeme vnmeete and inconuenient; for many wiues will be content to doe as their huſbands would haue them, in ſuch things as themſelues alſo thinke fit; but if any thing be required that likes not them, this they will ſticke at. More particularly we may diuide it into three branches.
                     1 That the wife be content to dwell and abide where her husband will haue her; vnleſſe it be an Idolatrous place, where ſhee may be drawne away to Idolatry, 1 Cor. 7.15. or where ſhee cannot h
                           •
                        are the Word preached: Examples of Sarah, who went with Abraham from place to place, and Rebecca, and Leah, &amp; Rachel, Gen. 31.4. with 16. Yea, if a mans calling requires that he muſt ſoiourne here and there, and trauell vp and downe: ſee, 1 Cor. 9.5. So Mary went to Ieruſalem with Ioſeph, not be to taxed, but becauſe ſhee was his wife, Luk. 2.5. the ſtory ſheweth, as Gods prouidence, ſo Mario
                              •
                           
                         obedience. Againſt this duty they offend, who are ſo addicted to ſome one place, eyther where they were borne, or where their friends dwell, that when their huſbands calling requires, that hee dwell in ſome other place, they will not depart to come with him; whereby it comes to paſſe, that either they muſt ſoiourn one from the other, or the husband is conſtrained to leaue his calling.
                     2 That they come vnto their husbands when he ſhall ſend and call for them: as Iacobs wiues did, Gen. 3.4. The Scripture regiſtreth the fault of Vaſhti, in not comming to Ahaſhueroſh, Eſter 1.12.
                     This condemnes thoſe ſtubborne and proud wiues, that will not come at their husbands call; they will

not be their husbands ſeruants, and why ſhould they ſend for them, ſay they, &amp;c?
                     3 That what

                        ds commands, &amp;c.
                     For Reproofe, two things are to be obſerued in it.
                     
                        1 That ſh
                              •
                            me
                              •
                           kely and gen
                              •
                           ly take reproofe.
                        2 That ſhe readi
                              •
                           y redr
                              •
                           ſſe the things reproued.
                     
                     The patient bearing of reproofe, is a ſpeciall branch of a quiet and meeke ſpirit, 1 Pet. 3.4. For as we ſay, the diuell is good when hee is pleaſed: and peruerſe natures will yeeld when they haue all things at their owne will and deſire; but if wh
                           •
                        n they are croſſed and checked, they then take it patiently, and ſubmit themſelues, this indeed is praiſe-worthy. And by this, 1 They much manifeſt the reuerence which they beare vnto their huſbands. 2 They ſhall learne much wiſedome by the milde and patient hearing of reproofe, as Mary did, Iohn 2.4, 5. S
                           •
                        ee replyed not againe roughly, but learned wiſedome her ſelfe, and thereupon inſtructed the ſeruants what they ſhould doe. This benefit they loſe by paſsion, anger, and impatiency. Yea, but what if the huſband be eager and bitter in his reproofe?
                     
                        Anſw. Shee muſt not raile againe, giuing word for word, &amp;c. Iacobs reproofe of Rahel, Gen. 30.2. was ſharp and bitter, yet wee read not but ſhee tooke it meekely without railing againe. Obiect. What if it be vniuſt?
                     
                        Anſw. 1 She muſt by any meanes, endeauor to make him ſee his own error. 2 If he will not heare her, but be furious and obſtinate, ſhee muſt beare it patiently, and meekly euen as ſeruants in the like caſe muſt doe, 1 Pet. 2.19. which condemnes thoſe wiues that are vnpatient of reproofe, &amp;c.
                     
                        The redreſsing of a fault muſt be onely when ſhe is iuſtly reproued: for otherwiſe where no fault is, there needs no amendment.
                     Now ſhee may bee reprooued either for neglect of ſome duty, or committing ſome fault: for the former, her duty is to perfo
                           •
                        me it more carefully afterwards. The latter, namely, committing of a fault, is either when it cannot be vndone or remedied, being once done; then is required her repentance and ſorrow for it, with promiſe, purpoſe, and endeauour neuer to doe it againe. 2 If it may be redreſſed, that ſhee doe it ſpeedily, as all Chriſtians ought to doe, and ſpecially wiues: So Rahel did by her Idoles: Compare Gen. 31.19. with Gen. 35.2, 3, 4.
                     So much for the kindes of obedience. Now come we to the generall point, viz. The Manner how this obedience muſt be performed: where two things are propounded to the wiues conſideration:
                     1 The place of her husband, who is to her in Chriſts roome and ſtead; and therefore ſhee muſt obey her huſband, as if Chriſt were before her.
                     2 Her owne place: ſhee is to her husband, as the Church is to Chriſt; and therefore as the Church obeyeth Chriſt: ſo muſt ſhee her husband.
                     
                        As vnto the Lord, ver. 22.) The wife muſt ſo ſubiect her ſelfe vnto her husband, as ſhee would vnto the Lord Ieſus. Heereof there are 2 maine branches.
                     1 Negatiue: No other obedience is be performed to the husband, but ſuch as may ſtand with the obedience due to Chriſt.
                     2 Affirmatiue: ſuch obedience as ſhee ſhould performe to Chriſt, ſuch muſt ſhee performe to her huſband.

husband is in Chriſts roome, and he indeed is the proper huſband; and therefore his will muſt not be thwarted and croſſed. 2 Seeing many good wiues are worſt vſed of their husbands, of whom ſhal they receiue their reward of their obedience, but of Chriſt? Hence ariſe two further conſiderations.
                     1 That if God and Chriſt Ieſus doe command a duty, and the husband will not aſſent that ſhee ſhould performe it, ſhee muſt doe it without and againſt his conſent. Prouided: 1 That ſhee be fully aſſured, that it is Gods Commandement, and that obedience to her husband in this caſe is contrary to it. 2 That ſhe be not raſh and haſty to ſay, God commands it, therefore I will doe it, but that firſt ſhee vſe all gentle meanes poſsibly ſhee can to winne her husbands conſent.
                     2 That if the Lord forbids any thing which her husband commands, ſhee muſt not doe it. Onely take two caueats: 1 That ſhe be ſure God commands the contrary. 2 That ſhee firſt perſwade him gently and meekely to forbeare, and not to vrge, and preſſe it vpon her, being contrary to a higher commandement: but if all this ſerue not, ſhe muſt obey Chriſt rather then him.
                     Examples of wiues reſiſting their husbands, are very ſparingly ſet downe in Scripture. We read of Rebecca, Gen. 27. and of Abigail, 1 Sam. 25. But theſe were extraordinary, and ſerue onely in the like caſe. Yet we may giue ſome examples, as if the husband forbid the wife to keepe holy the Sabbath day: if hee command her to weare garniſhed apparell, paint her face, to run to Stage-playes, &amp;c. ſhee muſt not obey, becauſe God commands the contrary.
                     Therefore as the Church is in ſubiection to Chriſt, euen ſo, &amp;c.) The affirmatiue part is, that ſuch obedience as the Church performeth to Chriſt, the ſame muſt the wife vnto her husband.
                     The manner of obedience of the Church to Chriſt, is manifeſted in fiue poynts.
                     
                        
                        1 Reuerence.
                        2 Sincerity.
                        3 Cheerefulneſſe.
                        4 A good conſcience.
                        5 Conſtancy and perſeuerance.
                     
                     Reuerence. Obſerue but the book of Canticles, and we ſhall ſee how reuerently the Church carrieth her ſelfe to Chriſt: ſo muſt wiues to their husbands: and though this, as is ſaid before, be a particular duty; yet in ſome ſort it is alſo a generall grace to be exerciſed in the performance of euery duty.
                     Sincerity: Saints will pretend no more in their outward actions, but what they intend in their hearts: the like is to be performed by wiues, 1 Becauſe they haue to deale not onely with their huſbands, who are men, and can looke but vpon the outward work, but alſo with Chriſt, who beholdeth the heart &amp; affection. 2 When their obedience commeth from the heart, it is both acceptable to Chriſt, &amp; pleaſing to their husbands.
                     Willingneſſe: as the Church doth readily, and cheerfully obey Chriſt, Pſalm. 110.3. ſo muſt wiues obey their husbands, as Sarah did, Gen. 18.6. whoſe willingneſſe was apparant by her readineſſe to doe that which Abraham did bid her: otherwiſe her obedience is neither acceptable to Chriſt, nor pleaſing to her husband, nor profitable to her ſelfe. This cheerefulnes, as it is planted in the h
                           •
                        art, ſo it muſt be ſhewed in the countenance, by her ſpeech and actions.
                     A good Conſcience; That ſhee ſubiect her ſelfe for conſcience ſake: this the Church doth, obeying Chriſt becauſe of her place, and becauſe it is pleaſing to him, though there were no other motiue in the world. So muſt wiues obey for conſcience of Gods Cōmandement, and for that their huſbands ſtand in the roome of Chriſt, and not as many doe, for by-reſpects, for feare, for praiſe, for hope that their husbands will let them haue what they deſire, and ſuch like: for heereby appeares a maine difference betweene religious and meere naturall women, Rom. 13.5.
                     
                        Conſtancy. This makes all other duties perfect and

                        Obiect. But the wife will ſay, If my husband were to mee as Chriſt is to the Church, that is, a wiſe and religious man, then I could obey him; but otherwiſe I cannot.
                     
                        Anſw. Shee muſt more regard his place, than his perſon, for by vertue of his place, hee carrieth the glorious Image of Chriſt, though in regard of his qualities and conditions, he may beare the 
                           •
                        mage of the diuell: like as wee ſee other inferiours obey their ſuperiours; but the 1 Pet. 3.1. puts all out of doubt.
                     
                        In euery thing, ver. 24.) The extent: which is not ſo generall, but that a limitation muſt be vnderſtood: otherwiſe it will bee contrary to many other places in Scripture: as, Acts 5.29. But it is layd downe in theſe generall tearmes: 1 To ſhew the large authority of the husband. 2 Becauſe the wife ought to obey in all things, that is, euery thing that the husband by vertue of his place may command, and not onely in ſome things, which ſhee beſt liketh of. So that in briefe, by this generality, not Gods will, but the wifes will is excluded.
                     From this ground ariſe two concluſions.
                     1 That the wife labour to bring her iudgement and will in ſubiection to the will and iudgement of her huſband: Not onely in things neceſſary, which are expreſly commanded by the Word of God, but alſo in things indifferent: for ſhe muſt think her husband to be wiſer than her ſelfe both for his ſexe and place.
                     2 Though in iudgement ſhee cannot thinke that to

be meere which her husband commands, yet ſhee muſt yeeld in outward action in things indifferent, for peace and qu
                           •
                        et ſake: Neuertheleſſe, ſhee may perſwade, and indeed the husband ought to heare her, as the Shunamites husband did, 2 Kings 4.23.
                     The reaſon is, 1 Becauſe hereby is her ſubiection manifeſted, that it is for conſcience, in regard of her huſbands place and authority: for if it be in things commanded, ſhee muſt doe it, whether her husband will or no. 2 For the peace and quiet of families: for from hence we ſee ariſe many contentions and brawlings, that the wife will not yeeld in ſuch indifferent matters.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 23, 24.
                           For the husband is the wiues head, euen as Chriſt is the head of the Church, and the ſame is the Sauiour of his body.
                           Therefore, as the Church, &amp;c.
                        
                     
                     THeſe words containe in briefe fiue Reaſons, to vrge and preſſe the former duties.
                     1 Drawne from the husbands authority: becauſe the husband is in the Lords ſtead and roome.
                     2 Vnder a metaphor: B
                           •
                        cauſe the husband is the wiues head.
                     3 Becauſe heerein hee doth reſemble Chriſt.
                     4 That by vertue of his place, hee is a ſauiour of his wife.
                     5 The example of the Church.
                     The firſt reaſon is a cleare point, by that generall rule, that all who haue any lawfull authority ouer other, they are as gods vnto them: as Moſes is ſaid to bee to Aaron.
                     
                     Hence ariſe two concluſions: 1 That the wife in ſubiecting her ſelfe to her husband, ſubiects her ſelfe to Chriſt.
                     
                        2 That in refuſing ſubiection to her husband, ſhee refuſeth ſubiection to Chriſt: prooued by example of Chriſt himſelfe, Mat. 11.40. Iohn 5.23. of Miniſters, 2 Cor. 5.20. Luke 10.16. 1 Sam. 8.7.
                     In thus doing, wiues ſhall be the wiues of Chriſt Ieſus. Now if wee conſider duly this reaſon, we ſhall ſee how ſtrong a motiue it is, to perſwade wiues to performe this duty of obedience.
                     2 1 Cor. 11.3. This reaſon ſheweth, that the huſband is to the wife, as the head of a naturall body is to it: hee is more eminent in place, more excellent in dignity; he hath power to rule and gouerne: and therefore it ſtands with the law of nature, that the wife doe ſubmit her ſelfe, 1 Cor. 11.14.
                     3 For the further vrging and preſſing the former reaſon, it is added, that the husbād herein hath a fellowſhip and copartnerſhip with Chriſt, and they are brethren in office. And though there be an infinite diſparity betweene Chriſt and the husband, yet may there be a reſemblance where is no parity, and a ſimilitude where there is no equality, and therefore this hinders not that fellowſhip: Hence two concluſions.
                     1 That hee is vnto his wife as Chriſt to the Church, and therefore ſubiection is as well due vnto the huſband by the wife, as ſubiection by the Church to Chriſt.
                     2 That they that do ſubiect themſelues to their huſbands, doe honour Chriſt: they that impeach the authority of their husbands, impeach the authority of Chriſt: yea, the very place of the head in a naturall body; as we ſee, he that impeacheth the authority of one Magiſtrate, impeacheth the authority of all in the ſame degree: See Eſter 1.16.
                     Corollary: 1 That Chriſt will ſurely maintaine the husbands authority, as Magiſtrates in the like caſe will doe one of another: Wherefore though the husband himſelfe forbeare, yet may ſtout and rebellious wiues iuſtly feare the reuengement of Chriſt.
                     
                        4 The fourth reaſon ſheweth, that the husband hath this authority not ſo much for himſelfe, and for his wifes good. The name of Sauiour, is properly and truely applyed to Chriſt, Math. 1.21. Luke 2.22. Acts 4.12. Luke 1.69. and 2.30. He is called ſaluation, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . But heere in ſome ſence it is applyed to the huſband, in that hee is to protect his wife, to defe
                           •
                        d her from hurt and danger. to prouide for her, &amp;c. And indeed the head is vnited to the body for this cauſe, not onely for the authority and ſoueraignety, but for the good and benefit of it: Hence wee ſee,
                     1 That the ſubiection of the wife, is for her owne good.
                     2 That they who refuſe to be ſubiect, as they are iniurious to themſelues, ſo they are vngratefull to their husbands.
                     5 Taken from the example of the Church, which if either example it ſelfe (which wee ſee is of great force both without and againſt precept) or if the warrantable example of the Church, that is, of good and perfect men, can preuaile; it ought much to mooue wiues to the performance of theſe duties: Hence theſe Corollaries.
                     1 There is as good reaſon the wife ſhould yeeld ſubiection to her husband, as the Church to Chriſt.
                     2 That by this ſubiection, the wife ſhall haue an euidence within her, that ſhe is of the Church.
                     Now for the generall vſe of all. If theſe duties be required of wiues: how carefull ought parents to be to make choice of ſuch husbands for their daughters, as be men of knowledge, wiſedome, and fearing God, to whom they may willingly ſubmit themſelues?
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Verſ. 25.
                           Husbands, loue your wiues, euen as Chriſt loued the Church, and gaue himſelfe for it.
                        
                     
                     THis duty of Loue, is a generall duty, and compriſeth vnder it all other duty, running thorow all

the branches of them. And it is ſhewed by the huſband,
                           1 In the vſing of his authority; and this two waies.
                                 1 By a tender reſpect towards his wife.
                                 2 By a prouident care to prouide for her.
                              Tender reſpect is either inward: and this, 1 In opinion as touching both 
                                 her
Place, to account her his yokefellow.
                                 her
Perſon, to account her in particular the beſt wife he could haue had, and the moſt fitteſt for him, though other may excell her in beauty, riches, or other good qualities.
                              
                           
                           2 In Affection, to delight in her onely.
                        
                     
                     Or Outward, that hee carry himſelfe as a m

                     And this is ſhewne
                           1 By giuing no iuſt offence vnto her.
                           2 By couering that off
                                 •
                              nce which ſhe ſhall giue vnto him.
                        
                     
                     That he may giue no iuſt offence to her, he muſt haue regard and reſpect,

                           1 To the duties which ſhe performeth.
                           2 To thoſe things that belong to himſelfe.
                        
                     
                     In the former, that duty of the husband is, 1 Kindly to accept what his wife performeth. This will be a witneſſe of his loue to her, and a great incouragement: otherwiſe it will miniſter griefe and tediouſneſſe vnto her.
                     This is manifeſted firſt in regard of her Reuerence: That he anſwer her courteſie with courteſie againe; for this may well ſtand with his authority, neither doth it preiudice it at all. This condemnes thoſe that Lordly ouer-looke their wiues.
                     2 In regard that ſhee will doe nothing without his conſent: hee muſt willingly yeeld her his conſent, as the Shunamites husband did, 1 Kings 4. Alwaies prouided that th
                           •
                         requeſt be iuſt and lawfull.
                     3 In reſpect of her obedience: he muſt haue a care that hee be not rigorous to exact all that hee may.

Nor to call her to ſo ſtrict examination as hee doth his ſeruants: Yea, his heart muſt truſt in her, and account her faithfull, and yeeld a generall conſent to her in many poynts: as,
                     1 Hee muſt note what is moſt proper vnto her, and heerein giue ouer the charge vnto her for the tryall of her wiſdome, and manifeſtation of his faithfull truſt he repoſeth in her: as in gouerning the houſe, 1 Tim. 5.14. Trimming and decking of it, prouiſion of victuals, education of young children, care ouer the maid-ſeruants: Yet ſtill interpoſing his authority, to moderate there where he ſees exceſſe.
                     2 Another duty is, to commend and praiſe her where he ſees her doe well, Prou. 13.28, 29.
                     Now in reſpect of thoſe things that belong to the husband to be performed to the wife: the duty is, That in all things he vſe Gentlenes, Mildeneſſe, Amiablenes, and Familiarity: Whereunto is that bitterneſſe mentioned, Col. 3.19. oppoſed, where a metaphor is vſed, taken from ſuch things as are bitter in the taſte, as gall, &amp;c. which when it is mingled with other ſweet things, maketh them diſtaſtefull: So if the husband in his authority, reproofes, commands, &amp;c. things in themſelues wholeſome, ſhall be bitter and fierce; the wife will neuer brooke nor diſgeſt them.
                     In particular this is ſhewed,

                           1 In his ſpeeches of her
                           2 In his carriage to her.
                        
                     
                     That he ſpeak of her to others with that mildnes, that others may ſee hee loues her, otherwiſe, rayling and reprochfull ſpeeches of her, will make others to brand him for an vnkinde husband, and alſo if it come to his wiues hearing, cauſe her to be offend

                     3 That hee command nothing vnbeſeeming her place, as Ahaſhueroſh did, therein offending, or that which ſhee is vnwilling to doe, or that which is idle and friuolous: for this makes her thinke, that hee hath a light

intimating that ſuch a thing was done amiſſe.
                     For the matter of reproofe, hee muſt haue care,
                     1 That the thing he reproues her for, be alwaies iuſt and true, auoyding h
                           •
                        rein two faults:

                        uſpicions, which are the ſeed of iealouſie, the bane of marriage.

                        s him, becauſe of ſome danger, either to her owne ſoule, or their eſtate. This alſo manifeſteth his loue vnto her: Hence wee read, that when husbands did reproue their wiues, it was vſually for ſinning againſt God, Gen. 30. Iob 2.9. 2 Sam. 6. Eſpecially if the thing be priuate, for otherwiſe if it be a light matter, the wife will think it to be nothing but reuenge.
                     For the manner: 1 That hee doe it ſparingly and rarely, to ſhew that he delights not in it: 2 That he doe it not at ſuch a time, when either himſelfe or his wife are ſtirred vp with paſsion and anger: for then he is vnable to giue wife reproofe, and ſhee vnfit to receiue it. 3 In regard of her p

                        So much for his Speech: Now for his carriage: It muſt bee anſwerable to his ſpeech, but otherwiſe, his tongue ſeemes to flatter.
                     1 In his countenance: for this bewraies the heart, Gen. 4. and 31. viz. That it be compoſed to a kinde of pleaſantneſſe in the preſence of his wife; not auſtere and grane, to ſhew his authority, &amp;c. For this will diſcontent her, and be a diſcouragement to her.
                     2 In his geſture, that it be not ſtrange: for more familiarity is to be ſhewed to the wife than to another, prouoking her alſo to familiarity: but this muſt not be done in publique, but in priuate, as Iſaac ſported with Rebecca.
                     
                     3 In Actions, that they be not furious, rigorous, and tyrannous, but ſuch as ſauor of loue and kindneſſe, both in abſence ſending tokens of loue, and in preſence, by giuing of gifts: as Elkanah did to Hannah, 1 Sam. 1.4. And it is a good counſell, That he giue it with his own hands, auoyding all furious and reuengefull actions, as the beating of his wife: which dealing is altogether vnlawfull. Which point, becauſe it is ſomething doubted of, wee will prooue the vnlawfulneſſe of it by ſome reaſons.
                     1 Becauſe throughout the whole Scripture, it is not preſcribed and commended by any one example, or precept: which argument, becauſe ſome may except againſt it; as not concluding, becauſe it is negatiue, may be ſtrengthened by theſe two conſiderations.
                     1 How carefull, copious, and plentifull the Scripture is, in ſetting downe the duties of the husband and wife, and yet this is paſſed by.
                     2 That whereas the Scripture is exact in ſetting downe all the parties that are to be corrected: there is no tittle of the correction of the wife by the husband.
                     2 The ſmall diſparity that is between the husband and the wife, doth not admit this; for of all degrees of ſubiection this is the leaſt, and ſhe hath a common equity

in many things, and is a gouernour of the family as well (though not as much) as he. What then is this, but to depriue her of her authority, to make her like a child and a ſeruant, and to cauſe her to be deſpiſed of his children and ſeruants?
                     3 The neere coniunction that is b
                           •
                        tweene them forbids it; they are one fleſh, as nigh as the body and the head. Now, what man that is his owne man, will beate, rent, teare, and deale cruelly with his owne fleſh? In Scripture indeed wee read of ſome that did ſo, as the man poſſeſſed with a Legion of diuels, Marke 5.5. and the ſuperſtitions Prieſts of Baal, 1 King. 18.28. and as the Papiſts doe now adaies. And ſurely ſuch as doe this, are either egregiouſly ſeduced in iudgement, if they doe it out of an opinion of the lawfulneſſe of it, or if they do it of fury and anger, they haue a diuell within them.
                     
                        Ob. But many and wiſe men too will let their owne fleſh to be cut and lanced, &amp;c.
                     
                        Anſw. True: but yet you ſeldome ſee any man haue the heart to do it himſelfe, but puts it to the Phyſician: and ſo no doubt, if the wife be extremely deſperate, and that there is no liuing with her, hee may vſe the helpe of others, namely, of the Magiſtrates.
                     2 We ſay, that the compariſon holds not in the end why it was made.
                     
                        Obiect. 2 Chriſt corrects his Church, and therefore the husband may his wife.
                     
                        Anſw. Chriſt is conſidered in a twofold relation.
                     1 As it hath pleaſed him to vnite the Church vnto himſelfe in marriage: and ſo is hee ſaid to dye for it, to guide, gouerne, and protect it, with other ſuch attributes, all which the Scripture giueth to Chriſt in this reſpect.
                     2 As hee is a Supreme Lord, Maſter, Father, and King ouer the Church, hauing abſolute rule and authority ouer vs, and by vertue of this hee doth correct vs, not as hee is a husband.
                     
                        4 The little profit and good that commeth by this, ſheweth the ſame. Now by all lawfull correction commeth profit, Hebr. 12.10, 11. For what hope is there that any profit ſhould redound vnto her, ſeeing there is no ground to perſwade her that this dealing is warrantable and iuſt, that in this he hath not authority ouer her, nor ſhee in ſubiection vnto him?
                     
                        Obiect. But this will make them dread and ſtand in awe of their husbands.

                     Yea, if ſhe ſtrike him, he muſt not ſtrike her againe: for then hee doth reuenge himſelfe: But if ſhee be ſo outragious, hee muſt ſeeke helpe of the magiſtrate, firſt, v
                           •
                        ing all gentle and good meanes, as reſtraint of liberty and the like, and all long-ſuffering and patience, before he make her a publike example.
                     So much of giuing no offence to her. Now the 2 point is concerning the couering of ſuch offences as ſhe ſhall giue vnto him, wherein his prudent carriage is knowne in a wiſe and prudent bearing with the infirmities of his wife. This duty as it is impoſed on all, Gal. 6.2. ſo after a ſpeciall manner doth it belong to the husband.
                     1 Becauſe he is more bound to beare with her infirmities than ſhee with his, becauſe hee is the ſtro

                     And in this thing will be the tryall of his wiſdome, and knowledge: for it is no commendation to beare with a good wife.
                     So much for the tender reſpect.
                     The next generall point is his prouident care ouer her, which ſhewes it ſelfe,

                           1 In prouiding things needfull.
                           2 In protecting her from things hurtfull.
                        
                     
                     Prouiſion of things neceſſary, is a duty belonging, of all other, to the husband, becauſe the wife is of all other moſt properly his owne, and alſo the chiefeſt of his family. Now then the Apoſtles ſaying, 1 Tim. 5.8. is a ſtrong proofe of this; and it ſtands with reaſon, becauſe the wife, when ſhe is married, forſakes all other, and cleaues onely to her husband: who is therefore to haue a prouident care ouer her. And furthermore, whatſoeuer meanes of maintenance ſhee had, being vnmarried,

it is now all in her husbands hands, ſo long as ſhee liues with him.
                     Conſider now firſt the extent, how farre hee is to prouide for her. This is
                     1 For o
                           •
                        hers. Whatſoeuer is requiſite that hee ſhould beſtow on others, he ſhould prouide for her.
                     2 For her ſelfe: 1 In her 
                           •
                        oule, to haue a care that ſhee be well inſtructed; a duty laid vpon the husband, 1 Cor. 14.34. Th
                           •
                        s is done, 1 In priuate, by maintaining of Gods worſhip, and Religion in his, daily euening and morning; doing this either himſelfe, as Cornelius did, Act. 10.2. or by others: as Micah would haue his houſe inſtructed by the Leuite, Iudg. 17.10. &amp; the Shunamites husband was willing to haue Eliſha, 2 Kings 4.11. 2 In publike, to haue a care that ſhee be partaker of the publike miniſtery of the Word: as Elkanah carried vp his wife with him to Silo, 1 Sam. 1.3.
                     2 For her body: 1 In ſickeneſſe to prouide all things needfull for her; as ſome to tend her, Phyſick for her and the like: And to doe this not grudingly, and repiningly, fretting becauſe her ſickneſſe is ſo long, and the charges ſo great; but let him then ſhew his louing care for her, when ſhe is leaſt able to doe for her ſelfe: leſt that his churliſhnes proues another croſſe vnto her.
                     2 In health to prouide for good rayment, and this not niggardly, and ſparingly: as many will goe brauely themſelues, and their wiues goe very meanely; yet, auoyding all exceſſe. Neither ought hee to deale heerein with h

                     So likewiſe, for ſuch things as ſhe ſhould beſtow vpon charitable vſes, hee ought to prouide for her, remitting vnto her the liberty, and authority to diſtribute, if that ſhe be not, 1 Superſtitious, 2 Vaine and light, and ſo likely to beſtow it vpon idolatrous and other ſinfull vanities.
                     
                        And it is likely, being not contrary to the Scripture, and agreeable to other rules, that Chuza did giue his wife ſuch an allowance, whereof ſhe miniſtered vnto Chriſt, Luke 8.3.
                     For the manner, hee is to let the wife haue ſomething of her owne property, for the better teſtimony of her faith, loue, mercy, and charity: for many will be liberall of another mans goods; and ſo may the wife in the common goods of the family, whereunto her husband hath right and intreſt: but when they come to diſtribute of their owne, heere will be the tryall of their charitable minde. Now diuers meanes there are to bring this to paſſe; as ſome will giue their wiues the rent of ſuch a houſe, or ſuch a field, the vailes, that which they get by working for themſelues, and ſuch like.
                     The continuance of the prouident care, muſt not be onely during his life: but alſo during hers, if ſhee outliue him, viz. That if hee be able, hee let her haue wherewithall to liue as well after his death, as ſhee did with him: at leaſt, if after portions diſtributed there remaine ſo much, to leaue her as much as hee had with her. And wee ſee Chriſt was more liberall to his Church after his departure, than when hee liued bodily: and this will be a ſure ſigne that he loued her, when ſhee ſhall ſee his care to prouide for her after his death.
                     Moreouer, conſidering her weakneſſe, to manage her eſtate; hee ought to appoynt ſome to haue a care of it for her: as Chriſt did for his mother, Iohn 19.26, 27. And for this cauſe did Dauid ſet Salomon in the Kingdome, that Bathſheba after his death might be well dealt withall, 1 King. 1.21. And as the more need is, ſo to be the more carefull for her, as if ſhee be not like to marry againe, &amp;c.
                     Contrary hereunto is the practice of thoſe huſbands,
                     1 Who by prodigality ſpend their eſtate, and ſo leaue their wiues worſe then nought: whereas this

ought to be a motiue to them to auoyd vnneceſſary expences.
                     2 Who by fawning and flattering get their wiues to make away their inheritance which came with them, without giuing them ſufficient conſideration for it, onely to ſatisfie their owne turnes while they liue. This is both an vnkindneſſe, and alſo a poynt of iniuſtice.
                     3 Such as vſe fraudulent meanes to depriue their wiues of the thirds, by deeds of gift, or other conueyances. This is a ſinne, becauſe we ought to be ſubiect vnto the Lawes, where they be not contrary to Gods word. And husbands ſhould ſo deale with their eſtates, that loue, and not Law might bring vnto the wife that which is her due.
                     4 Such as hauing old ſickely wiues, doe themſelues, when they are ſicke, deſire the making of their wills, to ſettle their eſtate, hoping ſtill to outliue their wiues.
                     So much of prouiding things neceſſary. The next point is, that he doe protect her from things hurtfull; A duty which in the generall is prooued by the phraſe of the Scripture, calling the husband the vaile of his wife: which as it implies ſubiection on her part, ſo it doth imports protection on his, Gen. 20.16. 1 Cor. 11.10. And ſo likewiſe from that of ſpreading the wing ouer them: as Ruth, 3.9. with chap. 2.12. For which reaſon, alſo God hath giuen ſtrength, boldneſſe and wiſedome, to the husband aboue the wife. It muſt be ſhewed in
                     1 Preuenting of danger, as in the example of Dauid, 1 Sam. 27.3.
                     2 In recouering them out of danger: as in another example of Dauids, 1 Sam. 30 18.
                     This protection alſo muſt extend it ſelfe, according to the danger: as
                     1 Spirituall: of the ſoule; that he keepe from the houſe Idolatrous perſons, as Ieſuites, &amp;c. and prophane and vaine perſons.
                     2 Corporall: to preſerue her from violence and hurt.
                     
                        3 For her good name: to maintaine her credit againſt ſlanderous perſons, being as well dead as aliue: wherefore he muſt alſo be ready to heare her complaint. He muſt be further carefull to maintaine her honour and authority in the family againſt children and ſeruants, yea, though they be the children of a former wife; vnleſſe that the cauſe be iuſt: for there are many cruell and rigorous ſt
                           •
                        pdames, and in this caſe he muſt vſe all gentle meanes to pacifie his wife: or if this will not ſerue, then to remooue the cauſe of this hatred, and to place the children ſomewh

                           •
                        part aſunder. The reaſon is, becauſe the latter wife is as true a wife as the former, and therefore the ſame duties belong vnto her which did vnto the former: for many times it falleth out, 
                           •
                        hat the ſecond wife is not reſpected like the firſt; but ſurely if the husband thinke he cannot ſo loue another woman as he did his former, the beſt way for him is to remaine a widdower.
                     And if not againſt children, much leſſe againſt ſeruants. Thus did Abraham defend his wife againſt Agar, though ſhee were his Concubine, Gen. 16.6. Not laughing at them, and ſuffering them to try Maſteries, &amp;c. For let the husband be aſſured, hee ſhall feele the ſmart by the diſcontent of the wife, when ſhee ſhall ſee he ſuffers any one to abuſe her.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Epheſ. 5.25, 26. &amp;c. to verſ. 33.
                           Euen as Chriſt loued the Church, and gaue himſelfe for it.
                           So ought men to loue their wiues as their owne bodies: he that loueth his wife, loueth himſelfe.

                     HAuing handled the duties, wee come to the manner how the husband ought to performe them.

In theſe words the Apoſtle ſets it downe, propounding
                     Firſt, 2. patternes for him to follow.

                           1 Of the Church.

                        lation in them, that there is great reaſon why the husband ſhould loue his wife, hee being as neere to her, as Chriſt to the Church, and himſelfe to his owne fleſh.
                     In the example of Chriſt, 6 Circumſtances are to be obſerued, in regard, 1 Of the Order, 2 Truth, 3 Quality, 4 Condition, 5 Meaſure, 6 Continuance of his loue to the Church.
                     In all which we will conſider of three points.
                     
                        1 To ſh
                              •
                           w how Chriſt loued the Church.
                        2 How wee muſt follow him.
                        3 How wee come ſhort of our duty.
                     
                     1 Order: Chriſt firſt loued the Church, and ſo drew her on to loue him againe; which as it is heere intimated by that which the Apoſtle ſaith, that he purged and cleanſed her, ſignifying, that before hee ſet his 
                           •
                        oue on her, ſhe was polluted and vncleane: ſo it is plainly proued by that in 1 Iohn 4.19. and Cant. 1.2.
                     In like manner ought husbands to beginne in loue to prouoke and to draw their wiues on: as well by their example, as inſtruction, eſpecially conſidering that is the weaker veſſell.
                     Contrary to which, is that vntowardnes of ſome huſbands, which ſo little regard their wiues kindneſſe, and dutifull ſubiection, that though they haue neuer ſo louing wiues, yet they will neuer loue. And this is it that makes the wiues ſubiection burdenſome.
                     2 Truth: Chriſts loue was not only in affection and word, but alſo in deed and truth; which appeares by that hee gaue himſelfe for the Church, and the effect, viz. the purging of the Church ſhewes it.
                     Such ought the husbands loue be toward the wife: For if to loue indeed, be a duty impoſed on all, towards

all, 1 Iohn 3.18. much more towards a wife, which is not onely a ſiſter, 1 Cor. 9.5. but neerer, and d
                           •
                        arer to her husband than any other in the world beſides.
                     The practice of moſt is contrary vnto this, who in word will pretend great loue, but when they come to deeds, performe iuſt nothing. Like ſuters that will promiſe golden mountaines, &amp;c. ſo are there many that will weepe with their wiues, and make great ſhew of kind
                           •
                        neſſe, but when it comes to coſt and charges, they may doe full
                           •
                        ill for all them.
                     3 Quality: Chriſts loue was an holy, chaſte and pure ſo
                           •
                        e, as appeares by the effect, that by it he purged and ſan
                           •
                        tified his ſpouſe: Wherefore alſo, leſt hee ſhould ſeeme to loue more than one, hee hath vnited all by one ſpirit, and ſo made one body of all.
                     So betweene husband and wife, though their 
                           •
                        oue ought to bee exceeding great, yet muſt it bee ioyned with purity, ſobriety, and holineſſe: as the Apoſtle ſaith, Heb. 13.14. Where he calleth the marriage bed vndefiled.
                     
                     Two 
                           •
                        ffects of this are, 1 That it reſtraines this matrimoniall loue only to their owne wiues. (
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ) 2 That it doth moderate Loue, that it turne not into luſt.
                     Contrary vnto this, is the practice not onely of Adulterers, which loue others beſides their owne wiues, but alſo of ſuch husbands, who both in words &amp; deeds will behaue themſelues towards their wiues with as much wickednes &amp; filthines▪ as vnto ſtrumpets, neu
                           •
                        r obſeruing any circumſtances of time, place, meaſure, &amp;c.
                     4 Condition: Chriſts loue was free, nothing in th
                           •
                         Church mooued him to loue, no benefit redounded to him by her loue; but his owne goodneſſe was the cauſe of it: For though Chriſt beſtowing many graces on the Spouſe, doth d
                           •
                        light in her as in his owne worke, ye
                           •
                         this was no motiue without him to loue her, but e
                           •
                        en his loue is the ground of his loue, Deut. 7.7, 8.
                     
                        So though there be nothing in the wife to moue the husband to loue her, yet ought he therefore to loue her, becauſe ſhee is his wife, and that God hath ioyned them together, endeuouring, if it be poſſible, by inſtruction and example, to make her amiable as Chriſt did the Church.
                     Contrary is the practice of thoſe that loue no longer than they haue outward baites, either of beauty, riches, parentage, or honor, &amp;c. Such loue is not of their wiues indeed, but of thoſe outward things.
                     5 Meaſur
                           •
                        : Chriſts loue is indeed out of meaſure: he gaue his life for the Church, Iohn 10.11. than which no loue can be greater, Io

                        fe, what will hee ſpare?
                     But will ſome ſay, This ſeemes a hard matter, and not for our imitation, that wee ſhould lay downe our liues for our wiues: But yet ſo it is, for beſides that the compariſon heere doth expreſly lay it downe, Saint Iohn, 1 Iohn 3.16. ſaith, that we ſhould lay downe our liues for our brethren: and then the argument holds a maiore ad maius, that if for th
                           •
                        m, much more for our wiues: But heere ſome cautions are to be obſerued:
                     1 That when it commeth to this high pitch of loue, there be an abſolute neceſsit
                           •
                        , that the good cannot be effected by any other meanes: as the benefit of the Church could haue beene wrought by no other meanes than by the death of Chriſt.
                     2 That the good wh
                           •
                        ch wee intend for them, be of greater value, than our liues, as for the good of their ſoules, 2 Cor. 12.15.
                     3 That we do
                           •
                         it not raſhly, but haue a iuſt and w

                        rrantable calling thereunto.
                     Contrary to this is it, that many will preferre any thing before their wiues good, as the caſe of coſts and charges, &amp;c.

                        eaues her, till he make her a glorious Church in heauen, Ioh. 13.1.

                           •
                        ſo muſt be added to the reſt, that the husband doe perſeuere conſtant in his loue: for this puts the Crowne on, and bringeth renowne to the party louing, and profit to the party loued. To this hee muſt haue care,
                     1 That it be grounded on a ſure rocke and foundation, namely, on the ordinance of God, becauſe that now they are made one fleſh: and not on the ſand, as beauty, or riches, which will weare away, and then this loue do
                           •
                        h faile with them.
                     2 That hee arme himſelfe againſt all thoſe things which may ouerthrow the building: and hauing once determined to doe thus and thus for her, to doe it notwithſtanding all oppoſitions.
                     Contrary to this, is the loue of many, which at firſt is as hot as fire, afterwards as cold as Ice, or none at all, and ſo alwayes variable as the winde: which ſhewes that it was but a naturall loue.
                     Now then, by this compariſon we may ſee what we muſt aime at, and ſo labour to be perfect. 2 By beholding how farre wee come ſhort of our duty, wee ſhall finde much matter of humiliation and amendment.
                     The 2 patterne is of a mans owne ſelfe. It ſeemes ſtrange why this ſhould be added; for is not the example of Chriſt perfect? Yes: neuertheleſſe, the Apoſtle addes this for very good reaſon, becauſe that this is moſt ſenſible, and ſo beſt perceiued: for a man that knowes not Chriſt, knowes how hee loues himſelfe: Wh

                           •
                        et ſome poynts doe more euidently appeare in this: as firſt, Cheerefulneſſe: No man loues

himſelfe repiningly, accounting it as a taske laid vpon him.
                     2 Willingneſſe: euery one is willing and ready to doe any thing that may be beneficiall to his own body.
                     3 Tenderneſſe: which wee ſee plaine by naturall experience, how tenderly a man will handle his own fleſh. So the Apoſtle ſaith, that none hateth his owne fleſh: but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it (
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        .) The metaphor is taken from birds that houer their wings ouer their young ones, or that ſit vpon their egges. We ſee how tenderly they doe it.
                     4 Intireneſſe: no man can diſſemble with himſelfe, for euery thing that a man doth, is knowne to himſelfe, and hee will pretend no more but that which hee doth intend.
                     Now according to theſe points ought the husband to performe his dutie towards his wife, which if nature cannot moue him to doe it, becauſe indeed this bond is ſpirituall and myſticall, and not naturall, then ought

                        aſon, religion, and conſcience make him to performe it.
                     Now let vs conſider theſe patternes, as they are motiues and reaſons to ſtirre vp husbands to the practice of their duties; where firſt we ſee that the arguments are drawne from examples, which many times are of more force to perſwade than reaſon: and therfore heere the Apoſtle maketh choyce of them. But among examples, what doe moue vs more than thoſe of Great men? Now who is greater than Chriſt? Beſides that, his example is alſo a rule of perfection.
                     That wee may ſee the weight of this argument, two poynts are to be noted.
                     1 The great diſparity that is betweene the Church and Chriſt, which appeareth in two branches:
                     1 The greatneſſe of Chriſt, who is in Script

                     1 To creatures: ſo hee is more excellent than

the excellenteſt of them all, namely, the Angels, Philip. 2.9. Epheſ. 1.21.
                     2 To God: he is euery way equall to God, no whit inferiour vnto him, P

                           il. 2.6. ſo that hee is Eternall, Infinite, Incomprehenſible, and to be adored as God himſelfe.
                     2 The baſeneſſe and meann
                           •
                        ſſe of the Church: ſhe is but a creature, and that corrupt and defi
                           •
                        ed through ſinne. Yea, take euery one of vs in our ſelues, and wee are more odious in Gods ſight, than any creature elſe, beſide the diuels.
                     But betweene man and woman, there is no ſuch difference; but they are equall in reſpect of gifts of graces by Creation, and alſo by Redemption: And in regard of infirmities, both were made of the duſt, both tainted with the ſame corruption, and ſubiect to the ſame end. The difference that is, is only outward for ciuill reſpects, in ſexe, ſtate and conditions, &amp;c. And ſecondly, it is onely momentany, extending it ſelfe but to this life, Math. 22.30.
                     Now then, if Chriſt, who is infinitely more excellent than the Church, haue yet choſen her to bee his ſpouſe, and doth ſo loue her; this ought to be a ſtrong argument to mooue husbands to loue their wiues, betweene whom there is ſo little diſparity.
                     2 The 2 point is, the ſmall benefit that Chriſt gets by the loue of the Church: If we aske what it is? We anſwer, It's nothing. For neither hee needeth to receiue any thing of her, being already full of the abundance of all good things, neither is ſhe able to giue any thing of her owne, becauſe ſhe receiues all from him, Iob 35.7. But much comfort and profit comes to a man by his wife: Yea, and that in his innocent eſtate, Gen. 2.18. and therefore is it ſaid, that he who findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, Prou. 18 22.
                     Wherefore if Chriſt, who ſtood in no n
                           •
                        ed of the Church, yet did ſo loue her, as to come from heauen to

dye for her, to giue her all good things, &amp;c. Let it then bee a ſhame for husbands not to loue their wiues, of whom they doe receiue great helpe and comfort.
                     Now we are the rather diligent, to marke and take heed to this example of Chriſt, becauſe that it wipes away all pretences that men vſually bring for their not louing of their wiues: As,
                     1 Some wil ſay that they are too great, &amp; their wiues too meane. To ſuch we ſay, 1 That after the marriage ſolemnized, the wife is partaker of their honour. 2 That if they looke vpon Chriſt, there was a greater diſparity betweene him and the Church.
                     2 Some will ſay that there is nothing worth in her. But firſt, hee ought to loue her therefore, becauſe ſhe is now his wife. 2 What was there in the Church, that Chriſt could loue and effect? and though hee loue thoſe graces in her, which are of his owne beſtowing, yet he loued her, before he beſtowed thoſe on her.
                     3 Some will ſay, that they be ſo peruerſe, that they deſerue rather hatred than loue. But, 1 this ought not to ſtir vs vp to hatred, but rather to ſhew our wiſedome to amend it. 2 The Church it ſelfe is full of corruption, rebellion, and prouocation to anger and wrath, yet Chriſt continues ſtill to loue her.
                     4 Some will ſay, that ſhe will doe mee no good, but be a burden to mee all my life. If this come through ſome infirmity, yet may ſhee doe thee good by her patience and well-bearing of this affliction.
                     2 If it be a wilfull peruerſenes, yet this is no charitable cenſure: for loue hopes the beſt. 3 Let him conſider what good &amp; profit the Church yeelds vnto Chriſt.
                     2 Concerning the other patternes of a mans owne ſelfe, this likewiſe is added to the former, not as a greater or ſtronger motiue, but as that which more ſenſibly and eaſily is perceiued of vs, than the former. Wherein the Apoſtle ſendeth vs to the ſchoole of nature, (No man euer yet hated his owne fleſh.) Seeing then that by the ordinance

of God, a mans wife is made as neere to him as his owne fleſh: therefore as nature teacheth him to loue and cheriſh the one, ſo ought conſcience and religion teach him to loue the other: for his wife is himſelfe.
                     Therefore 1 As in his body, if one member be cured, all reioyce at it: ſo if he be helpefull and louing to his wife, himſelfe ſhall reape the comfort of it.
                     2 As likewiſe if any one be neglected and receiue hurt, the damage redoundeth to the head and other parts: ſo if the wife be not tendered and cared for, the hurt and ſmart will be the husbands.
                  
                  
                     
                        Therefore euery one of you, doe yee ſo: let euery one loue his wife euen as himſelfe, and l

                        rning a briefe ſumme of the matter which before hee had deliuered, briefely repeating and applying it. Out of them we learne two points.
                     1 That euery one ought to apply that to himſelfe in particular, which the Miniſter ſpeaks to all in generall. (Euery one doe ſo) This duty Chriſt doth often imply in his Sermons: as, Mar. 13.37. Luk. 8.8. but more plainely in thoſe 7 concluſions to the 7 Churches, Reuel. 2. &amp; 3. when after a general inſtruction to al, he wils euery one to apply it particularly to himſelfe. But they might think that what was ſpoken to all in generall, was ſpoken to none. The reaſon is, becauſe herein conſiſts the profit of the Word; for who can take comfort by the promiſes, vnleſſe that he be perſwaded they belong to him? Who regardeth the iudgements and threatnings, vnleſſe he in particular can tremble at them? Or who taketh profit by direct

                        t of the Word, but he who thinketh with himſelfe, I ought to do thus and thus, &amp;c?
                     The vſe is: That as wee haue heard the particular duty of man and wife laid downe, ſo euery one in that

ſtate and condition ſhould now make vſe of them to himſ

                     2 That as we muſt apply, ſo we muſt know what to apply, namely, euery one his owne particular duty. (Therfore Paul biddeth euery husband to loue his wife, and euery wife to feare her husband.) For euery one is to giue an account for the neglect, or performance of his owne duty; neither ſhall any man be condemned for another mans fault, Ezek. 18.20. The husband ſhall not be blamed for his, wiues fault, nor benefited by her obedience, if he neglect his own duty: as if they muſt needs goe both to heauen together. But if one haue a care, and the oth

This further ſhewes the regiment of Chriſt ouer his Church, of what it is: That it is no Tyrannical, but ſuch as is for our good, hee hauing alwaies a ſence and fellow-feeling of our infirmities and wants. The world hee ruleth as a Iudge with a ſcepter of iron, Pſal. 2.9. &amp; 110.1, &amp;c. But the Saints he gouerneth gently and mildely as a father, not cruſhing them vnder his feete, but exalting them, Ioh. 14.3.

                     Further obſerue who they bee that are vnited to Chriſt. They are the Church, viz. all the Elect of God who are called &amp; ſanctified, whether militant on earth, or triumphant in heauen. Wee may alſo comprehend among them, thoſe that are not yet borne, if we reſpect that that ſhall bee, but not properly.
                     
                        Doct. The gifts of Gods Spirit are proper to the Elect, being called and ſanctified, 1 Theſ. 1.3, 4. 1 Pet. 1.4. The moſt precious promiſes are giuen to them, Rom. 11, 29.
                     Which refutes the opinion of thoſe that ſay, that iuſtifying faith and ſome ſauing may bee in the wicked and reprobate, aſwell as in the Elect, and that there is no difference, but in the continuance.
                     2 It teacheth the more highly to prize the proper graces: for thoſe things that but a few haue, are wont to bee much eſteemed: Yet other and they will make ſo great account of common gifts.
                     3 This ſerues for triall to know whether wee bee in the Church or no, and ſo whether Chriſt bee our head. Doe wee feele in vs ſpirituall life and motion, namely, the graces of Gods Spirit dwelling in our hearts? It is a ſigne wee are vnited to our head Chriſt: but if we bee ſtill dead in our ſinnes, dull in our vnderſtanding, &amp;c. wee may iuſtly feare that wee are not in Chriſt. 2 If there be a mutation and change in our nature; if our conuerſation bee heauenly, and wee partakers of the diuin

                           •
                        s of a true Church. Here are diſcouered two errors.
                     1 Of the Papiſts, that exclude all from ſaluation that are not of the Romiſh Church.
                     2 Of the Separatiſts, that doe wilfully abſtaine from all particular Churches.
                     Further, this ſhewes that this title of Head is proper to Chriſt alone; as 1 who hath it alotted to him of God, Epheſ. 1.22. 2 who is moſt eminent, high and powerfull. 3 who only hath receiued the ſpirit aboue meaſure.
                     Then it is a preſumptuous dealing of the Papiſts, who make the Pope to be the head of the Church. Their diſtinction of Imperiall and miniſteriall head is, but new found; for heretofore they vſed to ſay, that Chriſt took Saint Peter into the fellowſhip of the indiuiſible vnity, ſo making them both one. And as falſe it is, as neuer hauing ground in the Scripture; but is a m

The Pope is the miniſteriall, that is, he gouerns: which is to ſeparate thoſe offices that are cōioined in Chriſt: &amp; ſecondly, how doth the Pope gouern? is it by maintaining the peace of the Church▪ &amp;c? No, but by making lawes binde to mens conſciences and the like,

                     2 It is for our comfort &amp; ioy, and to ſtir vs vp to praiſe God; as the Virgin Mary, and old Simeon did: and for this cauſe, the Angell ſaid, that it was gladſome tidings, that a Sauiour was borne vnto the world a, Heb. 7.25. Ioh. 19.30. An euidence of which perfect ſaluation obtained by him, was his Reſurrection: for this cauſe, he is called Saluation, Luk. 2.30. Note here firſt the Blaſphemie of the Ieſuites, that deriue of that name of their ſociety, from that name of Chriſt, which is incommunicable. Indeede we may be well called Chriſtians of Chriſt, becauſe this name is communicable, for wee are partakers of the anointing: but no man is partaker with Chriſt▪ in the worke of ſaluation: as alſo, Linwood a Papiſt ſaith; and ſecondly, the dotings of the Papiſts, that ſeeke for other Sauiors beſid

                     The ground of this opinion is, that they hold, that election is conditionall: which Tenent is derogatory to glory, making his will and decree changeable, whereas he is immutable in both, and alſo depriues euery faithfull ſoule of a ground of maine comfort: which otherwiſe doth reſt in an holy ſecurity (oppoſed to feare and diſtruſt) when once it perceiues in it ſelfe the certaine ſignes of Election.
                     
                        Obiect. 1 Exod. 32.32. and Rom. 9.3.

                        Anſw. That is ſpoken according to the common opinion of men; now therefore Dauid deſireth God to make it manifeſt, that they did heerein deceiue themſelues, &amp; others were deceiued in them, who becauſe of

their profeſsion and outward carriage, accounted them to be written in the Booke of Life.
                     So in like manner, that which is ſpoken of Iudas, was ſpoken in regard of his office and Apoſtleſhip, not in regard of the eternall election of God: For in that former reſpect, hee might haue ſeemed to haue beene a choſen veſſell, Act. 1.17.
                     
                        Vſe is for comfort vnto vs, that though wee be not the principall parts of the body of Chriſt; an eye, or an eare; that is, not inſtructed with ſo much knowledge as others, &amp;c. yet if wee be of the body, wee ſhall be ſaued, Gal. 3.28.
                     
                        c Becauſe that ſatisfaction of Chriſt was a ranſome and price: and none can be redeemed and bought, but thoſe for whom it was paid.
                     Againſt carnall Goſpellers that hope ſtill to be ſaued, when as yet they haue no euidence that they are of this body: for the body is guided by the head; but thoſe by the prince that ruleth in the Ayre, Epheſ. 2.2. The members of the body loue one another: but theſe hate and perſecute the Saints. Briefely, this word body, imports two things, that is, 1 A myſticall vnion with Chriſt by faith. 2 And a ſpirituall vnion one with another by loue, whereof they haue neither.
                     So much conc

                     Which ſubiection is due on the Churches part, in regard of the place of Chriſt, who is her head; but much more in regard that he is ſo wiſe, &amp; ſo glorious a head, ſo prouident and powerfull to procure her good: and againe, in that ſhee is ſo farre inferiour vnto him, and therefore meete it is that ſhe ſubiect her ſelfe; and vnworthy ſhe were of ſo great benefits, if ſhe ſhould not: as Vaſhty was in not obeying her husband the King.
                     
                        Doct. Whoſoeuer is of the Catholike Church, is indeed ſubiect to Chriſt.

                        THe duties concerning the wel-nurturing of children, are of 2 kinds. 1 Such as reſpect temporall good: as, firſt, training of them vp in ciuility &amp; good behauior: ſecondly, in a good calling. 2 Or ſuch as reſp
                           •
                        ct ſpirituall good, viz. that they be trained vp in piety, which in the text, and diuers other place, ais expreſly commanded of God: who alſo for this end ordained in the Law many meanes to ſtirre vp children to aske of their Parents what they meant: as of the 12 Stones, of the Paſſeouer, &amp;c: commanding Parents to declare vnto their children the myſtery of theſe things.
                     Reaſons of this are,
                     1 This is the beſt good that parents can doe for their children, by reaſon men exceed beaſts: by ciui

ciuill men excell ſauages: but by piety, the godly man goeth beyond all other.
                     2 There is a nec
                           •
                        ſſity of this inſtructiō of them in the feare of the Lord; for by nature they haue no proneneſſe to it, and without this nurturing they will neuer learne.
                     3 This belongs to the office and charge of parents, as they who beſt know the capacity of children, and therefore are beſt able to apply inſtruction to them, and inſtruction comming from them, will take more place.
                     4 Becauſe children are borne of their parents in a wofull eſtate; and therefore as they haue beene the meanes to conuay ſinne and miſery vnto them, ſo ſhould they labour to be a like meanes of conuaying grace.
                     5 This is a double band to binde them vnto their parents in loue and duty, when both nature and a religious conſcience ſhall ioyne both together.
                     6 By this meanes when parents dye, they may with greater comfort and ſecurity commend their children vnto God.
                     7 This is laſtly an eſpeciall meanes of continuing and propagating the truth of religion and worſhip of God.

                     1 That they be ſure, that all ſuch principles as they inſtruct their children in, be grounded on the Word of God: for it muſt be information (of the Lord.)
                     2 That when they beginne to learne, they be taught to read in the holy Scriptures the booke of God: as Timothy was. Compare 2 Tim 1.5. with 3.5. for ſo with learning they ſhall ſucke in Religion: and 2 there is a ſecret and diuine operation in the Word to worke holineſſe.
                     3 That they be daily catechized and inſtructed in the grounds of Religion, Deut. 6.7. where continually ſignifieth according to the vſuall phraſe of Scripture, as the continuall ſacrifice, that which is done day by day; but obſeruing this caueat,

                     2 Many care not in what religion they be brought vp: Such are thoſe that haue rich and wealthy, but popiſh friends, to whom they will put their children to be inſtructed; wherein what doe they, but ſhew themſelues moſt vnnaturall, giuing poyſon to their children, and euen ſending them to the diuell?

                     1 For the beginning: Doct. So ſoone as the

childe is docible, and able to apprehend inſtruction, ſo ſoone muſt he be taught and nurtured in the feare of the Lord, Pro. 22.6. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         The mouth of his way. Like as they giue children meate, as ſoone as they c

                        n take it with their mouth, Pro. 13.24. betimes, in the morning, Heb. viz. of his age. Pro. 4.3. tender. Then was Salomon inſtructed. 2 Tim. 3.15. an infant: So dealt Anna with Samuel a childe.
                     Reaſons are either priuatiue, implying an auoyding of miſchiefe: as, 1 Vnleſſe they be taught betimes, they will fall into many ſinnes, becauſe they are pron

                         to ſinne, Gen. 6.5. Prou. 22.15. and as ſoone as they haue ability, they will execute it. This is a meanes to preuent it.
                     2 This preuents obſtinacy and peruerſeneſſe: for within a while they will grow refractary and indocible: as Hophni and Phineas.
                     
                     Or poſitiue, of fruites and benefits enſuing, namely, a good effect of their labour: becauſe, 1 Inſtruction is eaſily taught, there being an aptneſſe and inclination in youth to learne. 2 That which is learned in youth, is longeſt retained, Prou. 22.6.
                     
                        Obiect. But to teach children, is but as to teach Parrots that which they vnderſtand not, and ſo 'tis but labour loſt.
                     
                        Anſw. 1 The ground, 2 The conſequence is falſe: for 1 a childe, ſo ſoone as it is able to conceiue any thing, vnderſtands it better than any other creature elſe whatſoeuer. 2 Suppoſe they conceiue it not yet, 1 It is better that by this meanes they be kept from an euill courſe than let run into it.
                     2 This is a great meanes to helpe their vnderſtanding as wee ſee in Princes and Noble mens children, that haue good bringing vp, who vnderſtand more at 12. than many others at 20. yeeres.
                     3 As yeeres doe increaſe, ſo will they make vſe of that which they learne in youth, therefore though there

be no fruit for the preſent, yet it will come afterwards: as it is in

                        dren do moſt ordinarily follow their mothers. So Salomon and Abſalon, the children of one father, but of two mothers; the one bad, the other good: ſo it is when the father is a Proteſtant, the mother a Papiſt, the children commonly are Papiſts, 2 Chr. 2
                           •
                        .1, 3. Ahaziah fell to Idolatry, by reaſon of his mothers counſell. Which ſerues to ſtirre vp mothers to diligence in educating their children.
                     The ſecond branch of the time, is the Continuance. The childe muſt be inſtructed ſo long as the parents haue power and authority to gouerne him, which is, ſo long as he liueth, and they are parents, though there muſt be a difference put in reſpect of age.
                     For children are bound to parents as long as they liue, and ſo muſt be ſubiect and ruled by them. So Eli rebuked Hophni and Phineas, though they were married; and Iob had a care and command ouer his children, though they kept houſe.
                     Directions: That parents doe ſo wiſely carry themſelues towards their children, as they ſtill reſerue in their owne hands a power to curbe and brid
                           •
                        e them, euen when they are growne into yeeres. Contrary to which is their practice, which let goe the reines vnto their children, yea, put themſelues in their childrens power, and ſtand at their courteſie. Many haue found

the miſchiefe of this: as Dauid did in Abſalom,
                     
                     Concerning the meanes of Helpe, for the performance of this duty of education: they are two,
                     Frequent admonition: 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , to put into the mind more by inſtruction.
                     Due correction: 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , comprehending both.
                     1 Doct. That to inſtruction muſt bee added admonition, that is, they muſt labour to whet theſe things into the hearts of their children, to make a deeper impreſſion, Deut. 6.7, 8. Eccleſ. 12.11. Prou. 7. Becauſe the apprehenſion of children is very weake, and ſickly; and therefore vnleſſe that which is taught bee vrged, it will ſlip away. Parents therefore muſt obſerue the inclination of their children, and accordingly vrge and expreſſe vpon them thoſe things they haue taught them.
                     Contrary is the practice of thoſe, who thinke it ſufficient to haue told their children, what is to be done; but goe no further, complaining of great labor and paine that it is to bee ſtill in admoniſhing of them.
                     2 Doct. Correction muſt bee added to Admonition:
                     and this is either

                           Verball, properly called Reprehenſion.
                           Reall, properly called Correction.
                        
Reproofe goeth in the middle between Inſtruction and Correction, as a meanes to helpe the former, and preuent the latter. That a father muſt reprooue his childe, is plaine by Pro. 15.5. For if it bee a commendation of a childe to hearken to reproofe, it is a duty of parents to reprooue: ſee Gen. 34.30. Gen. 49.4, 5, 6, 7.
                     The reaſon is, becauſe of the fruit that thence doth ariſe: ſee Prou. 6.23.10.17.15.31. The fruite of it is life and knowledge, 15.32. &amp; chap. 24.25. The bleſſing of good, that is, of God.
                     Motiues to vſe this reproofe may be, 1 It doth preuent Correction. 2 It may be performed, when the other cannot be done, as in ſickneſſe, infancy, and elder yeeres.
                     Contrary to this, is the too indulgent carriage of parents towards their children: as Dauid to Adoniah, 1 King. 1.6.
                     
                        Reall Correction is next: it is not ſufficient to admoniſh, but it this ſerue not, God hath giuen author

                        de, which are

                        ion of the ſoule, Pro. 22.15.20 30.23.13. In this reſpect it is ſaid to deliuer from death, both temporall, and eternall, and▪ 23.14. from hell; and therefore parents muſt not in fooliſh affection vrge the painfulneſſe of correction, but in iudgement conſider the fruit thereof. 2 Poſitiue good: it teacheth wiſedome, Prou. 29 15. But ſome will ſay, that inſtruction is ſufficient to teach them, what is good and euill. Anſw. The greateſt wiſedome is in the pra
                           •
                        tice, which hereby is learned, bringing them to a neerer obſeruation of thoſe things that are taught; therefore it is an error in parents, that ſay that children kept vnder Correction, are ſots: ſee Prou. 13.24.
                     2 In reſpect of parents 1 Hereby they ſpare much paine: for this will make inſtruction more powerfull, though few times deliuered, than without it oftentimes inculcated. 2 This preuents ſhame and griefe to parents. 3 Hereby they acquit themſelues of being acceſſary to the ſinne, and ſo guilty of the blood of their children: as Eli was puniſhed for not reſtraining his children. 4 Hereby they ſhall bring eaſe, quiet, and ioy vnto themſelues, Prou. 29.17. when the childe is made ſo carefull, and watchfull of his duty, that the parents may bee ſecure of his good carriage.
                     5 If all theſe faile, yet hee hath the teſtimony of a cleare conſcience, in the diſcharge of his duty.
                     
                        Directions for the well and ſeaſonable performance hereof, regard firſt, the matter, ſecondly, the manner, thirdly, the vſe.
                     1 The matter why the childe ſhould bee corrected:
                     1 The parent muſt be ſure, that hee correct his child iuſtly for a fault; otherwiſe he will be but prouoked againſt his father; for there be fathers that correct their children for their pleaſures, Heb. 12.10.
                     2 That as he puniſheth them for a fault, ſo they make known this fault vnto them, after the example of God, Pſal. 50.21. 3 To correct eſpecially for thoſe faults, which they may ſhew out of the Word of God, to bee faults; and ſo ſhew that God is alſo thereby offended: for this will make them feare the more.
                     2 Manner. Generall rules: 1 That parents in correcting, doe call vpon God, for themſelues, that they may bee directed; and for their children, that they may reape benefit, becauſe that they are ſubiect to paſſion, and the childs nature is againſt it. 2 That correction bee done in loue, as in all things, 1 Cor. 16.14 ſo eſpecially to children, who take it as a matter of iudgement, in their parents. 3 That it be done, with a milde mind and calme affections, and to put it off, if rage and fury ariſe: as God doth, Ier. 10.24.
                     Particular rules.
                     1 That the quality and condition of the childe bee obſerued, and accordingly to meaſure our correction:
                     2 That reſpect bee had vnto the fault, according to the greatneſſe and ſmalneſſe of it, &amp;c.
                     For Prayers.
                     3 The vſe: 1 To obſerue the dealing of God towards them in correcting of them; which parents may obſerue by their correcting of their children, with what pitty and compaſſion they doe it.
                     2 To obſerue, that in correcting their children, they correct their owne ſinnes, and that the thing for which they correct them, came by their owne occaſion.
                     
                        Aberrations in this point are,
                     1 Too much indulgence. 2 Too much ſeuerity.
                     Duties of parents in regard of the riper yeeres of their children, when they are youths, are of two kinds.
                     1 Prouiding of its place and perſonall calling for the exerciſe of that gift, whereunto they haue beene heretofore trained vp: ſo Samuel made his ſons Iudges, 1 Sam. 8.1. So Iſhai had diuers ſonnes, whom he placed in ſeuerall callings, ſome ſoldiers, ſome ſhepheards: a calling of eſteeme in countries.
                     Reaſons are. 1 By this meanes they come to make vſe of that ability and faculty, which they haue obtained by their parents, in training of them vp; and without this they forget the ſame, like ſchollers that after long ſtudy haue no further calling.
                     2 Becauſe by this meanes they come to doe more good to the Church and Common-wealth; for before, they are but in preparation, and their paines (as of prentices) may in ſome ſort bee profitable, yet they are not till afterwards counted members of the Commonwealth properly.
                     3 By this meanes they come to liue of themſelues and doe more good to others; whereas before, their paines and gaines were for their maſters.
                     4 By this meanes they traine vp others, as themſelues haue been trained vp before, and ſo there is a ſucceſſion of calling, and a maintenance of Church and commonwealth.
                     Directions: Obſerue 2 Cautions.
                     1 That they bee carefull to place them in ſuch a calling as they haue beene trained vp vnto in their young yeeres. Bezaleel and Aholiab were choſen to the worke of the Tabernacle, becauſe they were skilfull men, Exod. 25. It is not fit, of a prentice to make a miniſter.
                     2 That the meanes of placing them be good, lawfull and honeſt, that thus entring in by thoſe meanes

that God hath ordained and warranted, they may depend vpon his bleſsing, as beeing thereunto called by him, 1 Cor. 7.17. What miſchiefs follow vpon an vnconſcionable entrance, all know.
                     Aberration in two extremes:
                     1 Careleſneſſe of thoſe that thinke it enough to haue beſtowed education vpon their children; and ſo account themſelues diſcharged, ſaying, that they will leaue them then to depend vpon Gods prouidence. (But we muſt know, that God appoynts meanes, without the vſe of which, we cannot looke for a bleſsing.) Others ſaying, that their children may ſhift for themſelues: iuſt like brute beaſts, that leaue their young ones when they are able to feede themſelues. And thus by their negligence, many times their children come to be very drones in the Common-wealth.
                     2 When parents are too prepoſterous and raſh in prouiding a calling, not conſidering whether the place be fit or no for their children, but onely whether it be gainefull and profitable, or of credit.
                     3 Another is, of thoſe that make no conſcience of bringing their children into a calling, into the Miniſtery by Simony, &amp;c.
                     2 The ſecond duty is, concerning marriage, that they be carefull to prouide marriage for them in due and fit time; a plaine duty of parents, Ier. 29.6. and 1 Cor. 7.36, 37. in practice, Gen. 28.2, 6. and 27.46. Agar learned ſo much in Abrahams houſe, Gen. 21.21. and and ſo did God with the firſt man, Gen. 2.18.
                     Reaſons, 1 Becauſe children muſt waite vpon their parents conſent, and therefore they ought to prouide for them.
                     2 Parents ſtand in Gods ſtead, and ſo muſt bee a meanes of ſeeking a marriage for them.
                     3 Marriage is a needfull meanes to keepe their veſſels in holineſſe; and heereby is a holy ſeede preſerued, Mal. 2.15.
                     
                        Directions, 1 That children may haue a free conſent, and that they be not forced: After Gods example, who brought the woman that he had made, vnto Adam, to ſee whether he liked her or no, Gen. 2.22. &amp; 24.57. for this is the neereſt, ſureſt, &amp; ſtrongeſt band, and ought not to be vndertaken without the parties good liking.
                     2 That the match be fit for them, Gen. 2.20.
                     Fit, 1 In Religion, Deut. 7.3.
                     2 In age: So God made the woman perfect at the firſt, as Adam, not a childe.
                     3 In ſtate, in ſome equality, elſe ſcorne and diſdaine may ariſe.
                     Aberrations in two extremes.
                     1 Careleſneſſe in prouiding marriage, letting them paſſe the flowre of their age.
                     2 Too much raſhneſſe, before they know what a wife and husband meane: and a third, prouiding vnmeet matches for them, ioyning them idiots, fooles, papiſts, prophane; ſo they be wealthy.
                     Meanes for the better performance of thoſe duties, are,
                     1 That parents haue a care to prouide a ſtocke and portion for their children, 2 Corinth. 12.14. Whereas ſome obiect, Math. 6.19. wee anſwer, 1 That Chriſt aimeth heere at couetouſneſſe: ſo as the foole laid vp riches.
                     2 Hee condemnes the manner, as beeing the onely thing which they doe, before and aboue the care of heauenly things.
                     3 The meaſure, heaping vp without meaſure.
                     Directions. 1 That this meaſure be not vniuſtly gotten, Prou. 10.2.
                     2 That they be not couetous, ſetting themſelues to make themſelues and their children rich.
                     3 That this be not a pretence for vncharitableneſſe.
                     Contrary to this is, 1 when men liue at the vttermoſt extent of their liuing, ſo that they can lay vp nothing.
                     
                        2 When men liue aboue their liuing, and caſt themſelues behinde hand.
                     3 When any inſnare their children, by cauſing them to be bound for them, and ſo breake their backes, and become their vndoers.
                     4 Couetouſneſſe, when parents lay vp indeed, but will part with nothing to their children before their death.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              EPHES. 6. VER. 5.
                           Seruants, be obedient vnto them that are your maſters, according to the fleſh, with feare and trembling, and ſingleneſſe of your hearts, as vnto Chriſt, &amp;c. vnto the 9

                     2 Negatiuely, by ſhewing what vices are to bee auoyded, ver. 6.
                     2 The motiues to ſtirre them vp to the carefull performance of the former duties, which are partly imployed, partly repreſſed.
                     Before we come to handle the kindes, it is neceſſary to lay downe, here as formerly hath beene done, the ground and foundations of the duties, which doe concerne either the opinion, or the affection of ſeruants. Thier opiniō, that they be perſwaded concerning their maſters ſuperiority, and their owne ſubiection, that it

is good, lawfull and warrantable, by the Word of God. For ſeeing Reuerence and Obedience haue relation to authority and ſuperiority; how can any bee yeelded, when wee are not perſwaded, that they to whom wee owe this, are our ſuperiours? Therfore did Korah &amp; his company fall into Rebellion, becauſe they thought that Moſes had not that authority, which hee tooke vpon him, Num. 16.3. Now that ſeruants may bee reſolued, touching the lawfulneſſe of their maſters authority, let them conſider, 1 That it is Gods commandement, both in the old and new Teſtament. 2 The many directions, that God giueth to maſters and ſeruants, to carry themſeleus in their places: But God giueth no directions for any vnlawfull calling. 3 The example of many godly men in Scripture, who haue beene ſeruants. 4 That, that the Apoſtle, Rom. 13.1. vrgeth it as a matter of conſcience, which hath alwaies relation to the Law of God commanding.
                     Contrary to this, is the opinion of the Anabaptiſts, denying any ſubiection or ſuperiority; their reaſons for it are, 1 If, ſay they, there be ſeruants, and this a calling lawfull, they muſt haue either Chriſtians or Infidels to their maſters. If Infidels, who haue no part 'in Chriſt: what an vnfit and vnmeet thing is it for Chriſtians to bee in ſubiection to ſuch? If Chriſtians, then are they all brethren, and why ſhould one brother be inferiour to another?
                     
                        Anſw. This calling of ſeruants and maſters, being a politicall ordinance of God, appoynted to vp-hold the Church, Common-wealth and Family, not their quality, but their place is to be conſidered: See 1 Tim. 6.2.
                     2 Againe, ſay they, it is againſt nature, our Chriſtian liberty, and thoſe prerogatiues we are endowed with.
                     
                        Anſw. Againſt nature, as nature now is, it is not, although if nature had remained entire and perfect, it had beene againſt nature. But God hath in his admirable wiſedome made many things, which are puniſhments

of ſinne, to bee duties impoſed on vs, as eating of our bread in the ſweat of our browes, a puniſhment, and yet a duty.
                     2 Chriſtian liberty is not hereby preiudiced, the conſcience ſtil remaining free, &amp; not ſubiect to any but God.
                     3 And as for our prerogatuines, they are to be expected in the world to come, and not heere.
                     3 They vrge that which is ſaid, verſe 7. not ſeruing men:) but heere ſeruice to men is not ſimply forbidden, but ſuch fawning and paraſiticall ſeruice, when we wholy care to pleaſe men, and not God, in ſeruing them.
                     In Affection, that the ſeruant haue an honourable account and reuerent eſteeme of his maſter. This is called here Feare; and it is deſcribed, 1 Tim. 6.1. See 1 Pet. 2.18. which affection in a ſeruant, if it be wanting, he doth indeed deny his maſter to be a maſter, Mal. 1.6.
                     The meanes to worke this feare, is to conſider the place of his maſter, namely, that hee is in Gods ſtead.
                     Signes of his feare are,
                     1 When the heart of the ſeruant deſires to pleaſe his maſter: as Abrahams ſeruant did, Gen. 24. the whole chapter ſheweth it. Which further ſheweth it ſelfe by a certaine ioy and delight they haue, when they haue done any buſines ſuccesfully, and for their maſters profit, as Abrahams ſeruant did, Gen. 44. verſ. 26.27. 2 A care not to offend them: as was in Ioſeph, Gen. 39.8, 9. which breeds a griefe in them, hauing done any thing offenſiue: as Oneſimus was, no doubt, grieued for his running away, and would not returne without a letter of mediation from Paul, his maſters ſpeciall friend.
                     Contrary to this is, 1 Slauiſh feare: as was in that idle and vnprofitable ſeruant, Mathew 24.25, 25. 2 Deſpiſing of their maſters, 2 Tim. 6.2. manifeſting it ſelfe in two branches, 1 Into light eſteeme of their maſters: as Agar, of Sarah her miſtris, G

                     Wee are now come to the kindes of duties, and

firſt, of Reuerence, which is an outward manifeſtation of that inward affection of the heart; To be declared, 1 By ſpeech, and that firſt to his maſter, two waies, 1 By refraining his ſpeech in a good and commendable ſilence, not ſpeaking in his preſence; or being in talke, to breake it off when he commeth in preſence, &amp;c. which ſhewes a great honour that he beares vnto him.
                     Contrary to this, is ſawcin

                        l▪ A great fault in ſeruants, who eſpecially ſhould be ſwift to heare, and ſlow to ſpeake, Iames 1.
                     Yet are there times when ſeruants may and ought to ſpeake. 1 When their maſters require them. 2 When it may bee behooffull for them: as when it tends to the good of their maſters, as 2 King. 5.3. Or when they would perſwade them to that which is good, and they are againſt it: as Naamans ſeruants, 2 King. 5.13. Or when they would more fully vnderſtand their maſters meaning: ſo did the Diſciples of Chriſt ask him many queſtions: or when ſome ſcruple doth ariſe in the ſeruants minde concerning the buſineſſe, as Gen. 24.5. Or to cleare their innocency, when their maſter ſuſpecteth any thing of them, 1 Sam. 24.9. &amp;c.
                     Contrary to this is ſtoutneſſe, and ſtomackfulneſſe, when they will not ſpeake nor anſwer, Pro. 29.19.
                     For the manner of their ſpeech, note theſe things, 1 In titles, that they bee honorable, and beſeeming their maſters places. 2 That their words bee few, eſpecially if they obſerue, that their maſters be vnwilling to heare of any talke, in that buſineſſe, as Iohn the laſt, verſ. 21, 22. 3 Their anſwer muſt be meeke, gentle, and humble, 2 King. 6.2, 3. 4 It muſt be ſeaſonable, not when they are cholerick. 5 Aboue all things, their ſpeech muſt be true; to which in this regard they are bound by a ſpeciall band.
                     Contrary to this, is, 1 Pride, ſcorning to reuerence their maſters with fit titles. 2 Scolding, as in many

ſhrewiſh mad ſeruants, that will giue word for word, yea, and will haue the laſt word.
                     3 Muttering and mumbling, ſpeaking neuer a plaine word. 4 Lying like Gehazi; ſhewing hereby the ſmall reſpect they carry of their maſters. The ſecond thing is ſpeech of them, which muſt be the ſame to others, as it is to their maſter, elſe the other will prooue but fawning and hypocriſie. To this end, 1 Let them ſay nothing in his abſence, but what they would be willing hee ſhould heare himſelfe. 2 Let them ſpeake of him in ſuch ſort, as others may ſee he makes account of his maſter and miſtris. 3 Not to ſpeake of any thing that may diſcredit them. 4 To maintaine their credit againſt others.
                     Contrary to this is, 1 To diſcredit their maſters vniuſtly by telling vntruths. 2 By blazing abroad ſecrets, as many ſeruants doe when they meet together, and as it comes to paſſe when ſeruants are changed.
                     2 By their carriage, which is another euidence of that reuerence and feare which they beare vnto their maſters: Yea, the moſt proper: for if their actions doe not agree with their words, they are but flatterers and fawners, yea, their owne words will condemne them, Luke 19.22. There are three branches, wherein this Reuerence conſiſts.
                     
                        1 In a dutifull obedience.
                        2 In an humble and decent behauiour,
                        3 In apparell.
                     
                     Obeiſance in comming to them, going from them, receiuing an errand from them, bringing a meſſage to them; to make obeyſance, ſee for proofe, Gen. 27.29. bow downe to thee:) 2 King. 2.15.
                     Behauiour: that it be modeſt, humble, and lowly: as ſtanding in their maſters preſence, 2 King. 5.23. and 10.8. And though Salomon was a King, yet this is common to Kings with other men; and wherein ſome may obiect, that by ſtanding, is meant no other, but to ſerue

and miniſter, as Deut. 10.8. Wee anſwer, that neuertheleſſe, the reaſon of this phraſe ſhewes, that they that miniſter, muſt be ready to performe all things; ſtanding vncouerd, as at all times, ſo eſpecially in the Church, where God and his Ang

                     Contrary to this, is the carriage of proud ſeruants, that ſcorne all courteſie towards their maſter, which commeth to paſſe when their maſter is poore and meane: whereby they ſhew plainely how little they

                     Contrary to this, is the practice of moſt ſeruants now a daies, whom by their apparell a man cannot diſtinguiſh from the children, no not from their maſters and miſtreſſes themſelues; all their wages, and what-euer elſe they can get, either from their friends, or by pur

                     The ſecond generall duty is obediences, the moſt principall and ſureſt euidence of their dutifull ſubiection, as alſo of their maſters authority: for reuerence is performed alſo to others, Col. 3.22.
                     To which is contrary, rebellion and diſobedience in ſeruants, the greateſt impeac

his place; faults in the former may come of rudeneſſe, and may be borne withall, but this is intolerable.
                     This duty doth manifeſt it ſelfe
                           1 In the parts.

                        tiue, partly affirmatiue. Negatiue, that they do not any thing of their own heads, without or againſt their maſters knowledge and conſent: for ſeruants, during the time of their ſeruice, are their maſters goods, and ſo are all their actions to be done, not for their owne, but for their maſters profit; and therefore good reaſon that hee ſhould haue the guidance and direction of them. Againe, the maſters will muſt be a rule and direction of all their actions; and therefore did Abrahams ſeruant enquire the meaning of his maſter, Gen. 24.5. Therefore the cares of ſeruants were boared thorow, to ſignifie that their eare muſt be alwaies attentiue to their maſters will. More particularly, this duty is ſeene in theſe points.
                     1 Seruants are not to goe abroad about their owne buſineſſe, without the conſent of their maſter. Contrary was the practice of Gehezi, going out after Naaman vnknowne to his maſter, 2 King. 5.
                     2 They may not enterprize and goe about their maſters buſineſſe, without his direction; doing that worke that likes them beſt, Prou. 31.15. For it is the maſters duty to allot vnto ſeruants their worke as well as their meat. Contrary is, when ſeruants will be their owne chooſers;

without their maſters conſent. So maſters did giue wiues vnto their ſeruants, Exod. 21.4.
                     Contrary is the practice of thoſe that doe take the aduantage of the law, and marry themſelues, of purpoſe to bee free, and to defraud their maſters of the reſt of their time.

                     5 Being hired by them, they ought not to hire themſelues vnto any other, without their full &amp; free conſent. Iacob hauing ſerued out his time, did neuertheleſſe tarry with Laban ſtill, hee being vnwilling to let him depart, Gen. 30.26, 27, 28. So farre was hee from going away without his conſent. And whereas chap. 31. ver. 20. hee went away priuily, 1 hee had the charge o
                           •
                         God to bee gone. 2 His time was out. Howbeit this practice of Iacobs is not iuſtifiable, neither can be alleadged for imitation in ſeruants. For ſeeing Iacob had Gods commandement for to goe away, and his promiſe for ſafety in his iourney, ver. 3. why could hee not haue had his departure knowne to Laban, whoſe wrath hee needed not to feare, God being as ready to haue deliuered him from the danger thereof then, as hee did afterwards, verſe 24?
                     Contrary is the practice of lewd ſeruants, who runne away from their maſters, like Shimies ſeruants, 1 King. 2.39. and as Agar, Gen. 16.6. If their maſters be cruell, they muſt doe as the Angell counſelled Agar, verſe 9. ſubmit and humble themſelues: ſee 1 Pet. 2.18.

                           ba, 2 Sam. 19.26. This is a moſt foule offence in ſeruants, and of all others doth moſt prouoke their maſters, ſeeing that hereby they in their hearts doe plainely deny his authority ouer them.
                     2 In regard of his instruction, tending firſt to their 
                           •
                        emporal good: as of prentizes, and ſuch as are cōmitted vnto others, onely for this end, that they may learne their trade. For 1 The maſter being bound to teach them, they are likewiſe bound to learn and to follow his directions. 2 This is the end why they were placed with them. 3 The benefit and profit is great, for hereby they come to liue of themſelue another day, &amp;c.
                     Contrary is the practice of idle, dull, and heauy ſeruants,

that regard not their maſters teaching, who care not ſo they may weare out their yeeres, though at the end of them they haue not learned their trade: heereby ſhewing themſelues enemies to th
                           •
                        ir maſters in diſcrediting them; to themſelues, by depriuing themſelues of a meanes to liue heereafter; and to their place, wherein they are vnprofitable members.
                     2 To their ſpirituall good, that as it is the maſters duty to inſtruct his ſeruants in the feare of God, ſo muſt they hearken vnto him. Ioſhua had ſuch ſeruants, elſe hee could not haue ſaid, I and my houſe will ſerue the Lord, Ioſh. 24.15. Such were in the family of Priſcilla, and Aquila, Rom. 16.5. So Philem. verſe 2. The Rulers ſeruants beleeued vpon their maſters relation, although they were with him when Ieſus ſpake the word, Iohn 4.53.
                     The neceſſity of ſuch inſtruction, as alſo the vnſpeakable benefit that ariſeth hence, ſhould moue ſeruants to the performance of this duty.
                     But wee ſee the contrary in almoſt all ſeruants, who of all others will not bee ſeruants to religious men: ſuch as are all naturall men, who are more ready to follow the Diuell, and thoſe that beare his Image, than God, and ſuch as carry the Image of God. And it is a common complaint, that prophane men haue better ſeruants, and haue their worke better performed, than godly; yea though they giue leſſe wages, and worſe fare; becauſe the one ſort, ſo as they may haue their work done, care not how they breake the Sabbath, and what other ſinne they commit, which the other will not ſuffer. So much did men preferre liberty in ſinne before meate, drinke and wages, and any thing elſe.
                     3 and 4 In regard of Reproofe, and Correction, which may bee ioyned both together; reproofe being but a verball correction, and correction a reall reproofe: and herein obedience is ſhewed in two branches.
                     1 By patient bearing all reproofes and correction

whatſoeuer it bee, whether iuſt or vniuſt, milde or bitter, eaſie or grieuous; this the Apoſtle Peter proues by many arguments, 1 Pet. 2.18, 19, 20, 21. Ioseph vniuſtly impriſoned by his maſter, mutters not, nor repineth, nor yet reuengeth it when afterwards he came into authority, Gen. 39.20.
                     Contrary to this, is the practice of many ſeruants, who being reprooued, will anſwer againe croſly and thwartly; a thing expreſly forbidden, Tit. 2.9. True it is, they may make an Apologie for themſelues reuerently, and modeſtly, but if their maſters will not heare them, ſilence, and patience is required.
                     2 Of thoſe that will not bee corrected, but if their maſters come to correct them, they will take the ſtaffe by the end. 3 Of ſuch as fearing correction, will runne away: as Agar, Oneſimus, and Shemeis ſeruants.
                     4 Of ſuch as will giue blow for blow. 5 Of ſuch as will ſeeke for reuenge, by miſchieuing their maſters at one time or other.
                     2 When they are iuſtly reproued and corrected, that they bee carefull to redreſſe, and amend that for which they were ſo reproued; for herein patient bearing is not ſufficient, it is not praiſe-worthy, 1 Pet. 2.20. yea, it is but ſtupidity and blockiſhneſſe. Thus did Oneſimus amend, Philem. ver. 11.
                     Contrary is the practice of thoſe, that notwithſtanding all reproofe and correction, goe on ſtill, and prouoke their maſters, either to adde more blowes, or in the end to turne them out of his doores.
                     2 part. The Extent of ſeruants obedience: how farre forth they ought to obey their maſt
                           •
                        rs, is implyed here, when it is ſayd (According to the fleſh) that is, in ciuill and carnall things, and expreſly layd downe, Col. 3.22. and Tit. 2.9. (In all things) which words being ſo generall, muſt haue ſome reſtraint and limitation. Becauſe maſters and miſtreſſes are men and women, and ſo being, are ſubiect to errour. 2 Some may be Idolaters,

Popiſh and prophane, and ſo may command that which is expreſſely contrary to Gods Word. 3 And againe, ſuch is the peruerſneſſe of many, that they oppoſe themſelues againſt God the higheſt Maſter.
                     Neuertheleſſe the reaſon why this ſo generall a phraſe is vſed, is to ſhew, 1 That whatſo
                           •
                        uer the maſter hath authority to command, and belongs vnto his office, in all thoſe things ſeruants muſt obey. 2 That the maſters authority is very large, ſuch as none but Gods contrary command can reſiſt. 3 That it is not ſufficient to obey in ſuch things as they pleaſe; but it muſt bee all things, though grieuous and irkſome vnto them.
                     Here therefore we muſt diſtinguiſh between things 1 Simply good. 2 Simply euill. 3 Indifferent. The 1 are ſimply commanded. The 2 ſimply forbidden. The 3 are good or euill, according to the diuers circumſtances: and in theſe indifferent is this extent eſpecially to bee placed.
                     The du
                           •
                        y then here to be learned is, that ſeruants muſt labour and indeauour to ſubiect their iudgements vnto their maſters, to think thoſe things meet and fit which hee commandeth. The ſeruant of the Leuites, Iudg. 19.11. would haue had his maſter lodged in Iebus, but the maſter thinking it otherwiſe meete, he was content and went with him. If their maſter appoint them to any worke, they ought to thinke this worke meete and fit for them.
                     Contrary is that of thoſe, who think themſelues wiſer than their maſter: ſo Gehezi thought his maſter vnwiſe, to let Naaman depart: ſo did the Prophets offend, 2 King. 2.16. in vrging Eliſha againſt his will. This is the cauſe of many miſchiefes, as of exceſſe in apparell, when they think their maſter not wiſe enough to prouide what is fit, &amp;c.
                     Now if they cannot thinke that what their maſter commandeth, is ſo fit and profitable for him, yet neuertheleſſe, they ought to yeeld obedience; this caueat

obſerued, that they may make known their mind vnto their maſters, with mildneſſe and reuerence. So did Io
                              •
                           b, 2 Sam. 24.3, 4. wherein hee did not ſinne. For a man that is in authority, may ſinne in commanding, and yet hee that is in ſubiection, not ſinne in obeying the command; becauſe the thing being in it ſelfe lawfull, the ſinne r
                           •
                        ſpects the minde of him that commands, as the numbring of the people, Dauids proud minde.
                     For hereby a ſeruant ſhewes his hearty obedience the more plainly, when hee yeeldeth r
                           •
                        adily to that which is contrary to his will. 2 This is a ſpeciall meanes to preſerue peace and loue.
                     Contrary to this, is peremptorineſſe in ſeruants, that will obey no further then themſelues ſee reaſon.
                     The reſtraint of this generality is expreſſed in 4 clauſes: 1 As vnto Chriſt, verſ. 5. 2 As ſeruants of Chriſt, verſ. 6. 3 Doing the will of God, ibid. 4 Seruing the Lord, verſe 7.
                     All which imply in the generall; that ſeruants obedience to their maſters, muſt be ſuch as may ſtand with their obedience to Chriſt. For 1 Chriſt is the higheſt maſter. 2 To him we are to giue the laſt account of all our actions. 3 His fauour muſt be preferred, and his wrath and vengeance muſt be feared.
                     For more particular application of theſe generall grounds: 1 If the maſter command any thing that Chriſt forbids, the ſeruant is freed in this caſe, he may not obey; for this are Sauls ſeruants commended, 1 Sam. 22.17. and the midwiues, Exod. 1.17. and Ioſeph, Gen. 39.12. And if a King is not to be obeyed in ſuch things, much leſſe a priuate man.
                     For maſters heerein goe beyond their commiſsion, and ſo loſe their authority, and are not to be obeyed, no more than a Conſtable or Sherife, &amp;c. that goe beyond their office.
                     Heere neuertheleſſe, this caution is to be noted, that they be not peremptory: but 1 That they be ſure that

God commands the contrary to their maſter. 2 That with all reuerence they ſhew their maſter his errour by the word of God, and to perſwade him not to command them that which is contrary to it, before they abſolutely refuſe to obey.
                     Contrary to this, is men-pleaſing, when as ſeruants care is ſo to pleaſe their maſter, that they reſpect not God: as Do eg, 1 Sam. 21.18. Mat. 2.16. Dan. 3.20. neither are there ſo wicked maſters, but they ſhall finde ſuch men-pleaſers as will execute their will and command; but what the iudgements of God are vpon ſuch, we may ſee by the example of thoſe, Dan. 3.22.
                     
                        Obiect. The Apoſtle, Titus 2.9. willeth ſeruants to pleaſe their maſters in all things.
                     
                        Anſw. 1 Men muſt be pleaſed in thoſe things that belong vnto their power to command. 2 The Apoſtle in that place ſpeaketh of man, as oppoſed to God, in the text, as ſubordinate to God; there ſo to pleaſe men, as to diſpleaſe God, heerein pleaſing of them, ſtanding in the place of God, to pleaſe God himſelfe. Briefely, here is meant to pleaſe men in God, for God, and vnder God: So that ſo farre as ſeruants can approue themſelues to God, and haue the teſtimonies of a good conſcience, and withall pleaſe their maſter, this man-pleaſing is lawfull.
                     2 If maſters forbid any thing that is by God expreſly commanded, ſeruants muſt not therfore abſtaine: So did Daniel, Dan. 6.10. Reaſon is, we haue a good warrant ſo to doe, euen of God himſelfe; and if a man haue the warrant of the King, what need he feare, although an inferiour magiſtrate doe forbid him? Thus if ſeruants be commanded not to giue good weight, they muſt not doe it, although they may keepe the price which their maſter ſets: ſo if to breake the Sabbath and the like.
                     Onely let them be ſure and certaine, that God hath forbidden that which their maſter hath commanded.
                     Contrary heereunto is ſlauiſhneſſe, and timorouſneſſe,

when they feare their maſter more than God.
                     For the auoyding of theſe extremes, and the better to performe the former duties, let ſeruants
                     1 Labour to be fully inſtructed what is the will and commandement of God, Epheſ. 5.17.
                     2 Let them labour to haue their mindes poſſeſſed with the true feare of God.
                     3 Let thoſe ſeruants that be at liberty, haue a carefull reſpect in chuſing of their maſters, that they as well regard their inward diſpoſition, as their outward calling; for this it was that Ruth followed Naomi, becauſe ſhee ſaw ſhe was Religious, 1 Ruth 1.16.
                     4 Hauing beene brought by the prouidence of God vnder ſuch maſters as are Religious, to cleaue vnto them, and to remaine with them, Iohn 6.68.
                     Contrary to which, is careleſneſſe in ſeruants, that regard not to what maſter they binde themſelues, be they worldlings, prophane, popiſh, &amp;c. all is one to them; whereby they bring themſelues into many ſtraights, eyther to diſobey God, or to diſpleaſe their maſter, &amp;c. So much for the Extent and Reſtraint.
                     3 The manner of obedience is layd downe in 4 branches.
                     
                        1 With feare and trembling.
                        2 With ſingleneſſe of heart.
                        3 With good conſcience.
                        4 With good will.
                     
                     1 Feare and trembling: the phraſe is doubled, to ſhew the neceſsity of the duty: by feare is meant, all the former, and reſpect which ſeruants owe to their maſters: by trembling is meant, an awe &amp; feare to prouoke their maſter to puniſh them. For as we may feare God in regard of his power, that hee is able to execute ſo great vengeance on vs; ſo may maſters be feared, becauſe God hath giuen the rod into their hand, to execute puniſhment on the diſobedient, Rom. 13.5. Thus was Obadiah afraid to prouoke Ahab, 1 King. 18.9.
                     
                        Contrary to this trembling in the defect is, 1 Too much familiarity. 2. Anſwering againe, murmuring and repining. 3 Careleſneſſe in prouoking their maſter, thinking with themſelues, it can bee but a beating, &amp;c. In the exceſſe, ſlauiſh feare, when all things are done for feare of the rod.
                     2 Singleneſſe of heart: that is, that the ſeruice which they performe, be done with an honeſt and vpright heart, pretending no more in outward ſhew, then they intend inwardly in the heart: it is called ſingleneſſe of heart, in oppoſition to thoſe phraſes in Scripture of a double heart, or, a heart and a heart, as Pſal. 12.2. Such an vpright heart was in Ioſeph, Gen. 39.8, 9.
                     Reaſon is, becauſe ſeruants haue to doe not onely with their maſter, but alſo with Chriſt, who ſearcheth the heart, and by the ſame giueth iudgement of the action, Ier. 17.10.
                     2 Becauſe honeſty and vprightneſſe is ſo acceptable vnto Chriſt, and hee delighteth ſo much in it.
                     Contrary to this, is eye ſeruice, when they content themſelues with the outward worke, and neuer regard their heart; ſuch are moſt ſeruants.
                     2 Hypocriſie and diſſimulation, when they will carry a faire face, fawne and flatter, yet care not what wrong they doe vnto their maſter: as Paraſites.
                     3 Good Conſcience, implyed in theſe ſpeeches: 1 As vnto Chriſt. 2 As the ſeruants of Chriſt. 3 As doing the will of God. 4 As ſeruing the Lord. Whence the Doctrine is: That ſeruants muſt haue reſpect to the will and ordinance of God, obeying becauſe of it, although there were no other reaſon, Rom. 13.5. 1 Pet. 2.13.
                     This puts a maine difference betweene Chriſtian ſeruants, and ſuch as are wicked and prophane.
                     2 In this may ſeruants reape true comfort, in hope of reward at Gods hands, howeuer their maſter doe deale with them.
                     Contrary is that of many ſeruants, who although

they bee good at their worke, yet doe it not for conſcience ſake, but for feare, for gaine, or ſome like by-reſpects.
                     4 Good will: which reſpects the minde of the ſeruant, and it is either in regard of himſelfe, or of his maſter: of himſelfe, that his ſeruice bee done willingly and cheerefully: of his maſter, that it bee for his profit.
                     
                        Doct. 1 Seruants muſt doe ſeruice with willingnes and cheerefulneſſe; as Chriſt a ſeruant, Phil. 2.7. did the will of his Father cheerefully and readily. Pſal. 40.7, 8. Euen with as great a deſire, as to his ordinary food, Iob 4.34. So did Iacob, Gen. 39.20. For the time of his ſeruice ſeemed ſhort vnto him: which is a ſigne he did it cheerfully. And although the reaſon be there rendred, becauſe he loued Rachel; yet may theſe both ſtand together; yea, if hee had not ſerued cheerefully, the time would haue ſeemed ſo much the longer, becauſe of that loue he bare Rachel.
                     
                     Reaſons hereof are, 1 In regard of God, who loueth cheerefulneſſe. 2 of our ſelues: becauſe it eaſeth the burden of the worke. And for a motiue to ſtirre vs vp to readineſſe, conſider wee of the reward that God will giue to ſuch as bee faithfull in their calling.
                     Contrary is, when ſeruants do their buſineſſe grudgingly, heauily, and of neceſſity; wherein neither themſelues can reape comfort, God not accepting of their worke, nor their maſters profit, it being done for the moſt part vntowardly.
                     2 The profit of their maſter: to this is required, 1 Speedineſſe and quickneſſe, that they diſpatch their buſineſſe ſo ſoone as they can. This was commendable in Abrahams ſeruant, Gen. 24.33, 54, 56. 2 King. 4.29. This ſpeedineſſe about buſineſſe is a ſigne of of willingneſſe.
                     2 Diligence. That they imploy all their labour and care (continually) for their maſters good, Ecc. 9.10. For

this is the Talent and worke of the Lord, which hee hath giuen to ſeruants, viz. To be diligent in their place and ſeru
                           •
                        ce towards their maſter, then looke Ier. 48.10. This diligence was in Iacob, Gen. 31.38, 39, 40. What fruit commeth by this diligence, is often expreſſed in the Prou. chap. 10.4. and 12.24. &amp;c.
                     Contrary to this, is Sluggiſhneſſe and Idleneſſe: which in a ſeruant how irkſome it is, ſee Prou. 10.26. how vnprofitable and hurtfull, Prou. 18.9. Yea, all ſlothfull ſeruants are theeues, robbing their maſters of their beſt paines &amp; labour, which is as due to them, as meate and drinke to ſeruants. Such idle ſeruants are thoſe, who if they bee ſent of a buſineſſe, will haue much talke and prate about it, before it can bee done, Prou. 14.23. It is alſo hurtfull for themſelues: for hee that is ſlothfull for his maſter, will ſeldome be diligent for himſelfe.
                     3 Laſtly, herein is required Faithfulneſſe, a chiefe and principall dutie of ſeruants, and to bee referred to the whole manner of their obedience. This is implyed too here by (good will) and in that muſt ſerue their maſters as (doing the will of God,) whoſe will it is, that euery one bee faithfull in his place. And it is expreſſely commanded, Tit. 2.10. And the Apoſtle takes it for a ruled caſe, Heb. 3.5. implying that if he were a ſeruant, hee muſt be faithfull: for this, were thoſe ſeruants that receyued the Talents, commended by Chriſt, Mat. 25. and thus Chriſt himſelfe was faithfull, Hebrews 3.2.
                     Reaſon of it is, becauſe ſeruants are ſtewards, and muſt giue an account of their taske committed to them, as Luk. 16.2. both to their maſters and to God, who will finde them out, if they bee vnfaithfull.
                     Contrary vnto it, is fraud, deceit, vntruſtineſſe, theeuiſhneſſe, &amp;c. In ſeruants, whereby they bring vnto their maſter hurt and damage.
                     But not to inſiſt in the generall, let vs ſee more particularly, wherein this faithfulneſſe is required: This is,
                     
                        1 In regard of their maſters goods, in a double reſpect. 1 In keeping ſafe all ſuch goods of their maſt
                           •
                        rs, as are committed to their charge; that through their careleſneſſe and negligence nothing be loſt: thus was Ioseph faithfull, that his maſter durſt truſt him with a
                           •
                        l that he had, Gen. 39. And Iacobs exampl

                        l ſeruants, Gen. 31.38, 39. Where alſo we ſee, that if any be impayred, and loſt by ſeruants negligence, it do
                           •
                        h indeed belong vnto them to make it good. That word which the Apoſtle vſ
                           •
                        th, 1 Tim. 6.20. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , is a metaphor taken from ſeruants.
                     
                        
                           •
                        or this is the end why they receiue them into their homes, and put them in truſt with their goods, themſelues being then more ſecure, and not looking to them ſo much as otherwiſe they would, truſting vpon th

                           •
                        y come to yeers, to reſpect them with reuerence, not eſteeming of them as their equals, but as of their ſuperiors, being the children of their maſters. So did Abrahams ſeruant call Iſaac maſter, Gen 24.65.
                     Contrary to this, is when ſeruants are doggiſh and churliſh to the Children. Let ſuch take heed, leſt they get ſuch a cuſtome by it, as that they prooue churliſh to their owne alſo. Alſo ſluttiſhneſſe, and further, when by corrupt, rotten, and euill communication that commeth from them, they infect children, who learne of them to ſweare, to ſing lewd ſongs, and the like. So it commeth to paſſe, that many times a man hath his children ſpoyled, euen by his ſeruants, who teach them ſo much wickedneſſe whileſt they are young, that hardly it can be rooted out a great while after. Againe, when ſeruants will inueigle away the affection of children, either to marry them, as when they haue portions, &amp;c. or to commit vncleanneſſe with them; whereby many times parents affection is alienated from their children, to diſ-inherite them, or the like. Laſtly, when they ſhall withdraw their portion from them and conuert it to their owne vſe.
                     6 In regard of the maſters bedfellow, his wife, or the miſtreſſes bedfellow, her husband, that ſeruants doe onely not intice them, but not yeeld vnto any inticing

of their vncleanneſſe, as Ioſeph did, Gen. 39.

                     Contrary to this, is when ſeruants be Iudaſſes to betray their owne maſters.
                     3 The third and laſt point is, the motiues to ſtirre vp ſeruants to performe the former duties.
                     1 Motiue is drawne from the place of their maſters, who are in Chriſt ſtead: wherefore in obeying them, they obey Chriſt, and r

                     2 From the place of ſeruants: becauſe in a conſcionable performance of their ſeruice vnto their maſters, they ſhew themſelu

                           •
                        ane, yet indeed it is honorable. To be the ſeruant of the King, is an honorable place: which ought to be a comfort and incouragement of ſeruants, that they ſhould not thinke themſelues troden vnder foote, and made baſe; ſeeing that euen by vertue of this, that they are ſeruants, th
                           •
                        y are the ſeruants of Chriſt, 1 Cor. 7.21.
                     3 From the ground of their ſubiection, the will of God, which

                         motiue to ſtirre vp ſeruants to their duty, becauſe it is the will of God in his Word. This motiue is of great moment to perſwade ſeruants to be content with their place of ſubi
                           •
                        ction in which they are put, and alſo faithfully to do their duties, ſeeing both are the will of God.

                     1 For the choyce: the duty is, that maſters be carefull to chooſe ſuch ſeruants as be good: ſuch was the care of Dauid, Pſalm. 101.6. And if this care be in maſters, it ſhewes plainly that they haue a care to the good both of their family, and of Church and Commonwealth; whereof the family is the ſeminary. 2 This will be a meanes, that maſters ſhall receiue more good from their ſ

                     Contrary is that of thoſe, who carry themſelues baſely, and abiectly in their houſe before their ſeruants, being vaine, fooliſh, wicked, &amp;c. This makes ſeruants to contemne and to deſpiſe them. This made Michol deſpiſe Dauid who in her conceit had debaſed himſe

                        Vſe is to teach maſters to ſhake off all vaine hopes and pretences, that God will reſpect them more than their ſeruants, becauſe they are great, and haue friends, &amp;c. their ſeruants are but baſe and meane, &amp;c. 2 This is for imitation of Magiſtrates accordingly to carry themſelues. 3 It teacheth mi

                     Further, marke the inference of this reaſon vpon the duety: the Apoſtle bids them forbeare threatning, becauſe

they haue a Maſter that is ouer them. Whence obſerue that ignorance of that place of ſubie

                        tion wherein we are, &amp; of that authority vnder which we are, makes vs inſolent and cruell. This appeares in Pharaoh, who was cruell to the Iſraelites, becauſe hee knew not God, Exod. 5.2. and Sennac

                     Now, whereas the Apoſtle, in ſetting downe the duty of maſters, bringeth ſuch a ſtrong reaſon to moue them, and yet in the duties of husbands and wiues, parents and children, doth not ſo: the reaſon is, becauſe in husbands and parents there is a naturall loue and affection, which doth moue them; but in maſters there is no ſuch thing: and therefore hee layeth downe a thundring reaſon, bringing them to the Iudgement-ſeate of God, ſo to terifie them.

                     THe ſumme of theſe words, is an exhortation to Chriſtian ſpirituall courage and fortitude. The parts are
                     1 An exhortation to a duty.
                     2 A direction ſhewing the meanes for the performance of that dutie.
                     In the exhortation, conſider we the manner, and the matter. The manner is in theſe words, Finally, my brethren. Wherein note, 1 The neceſsity of the matter, which the Apoſtle exhorts vnto: in the word (Finally)

                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , 2 The affection of the Apoſtle, (my brethren.)
                     1 Finally.) As if the Apoſtle ſhould haue ſaid, I haue inſtructed you in the former part of my Epiſtle, in all poynts neceſſary to be knowne and bel

                           •
                        l duties of all, and the particular duties that belong to euery one in his calling, and particular place; yet is a remainder, euen this one thing, which I will now deliuer vnto you, without which, all that hath beene formerly deliuered, will be but vnprofitable, and of no vſe. Hence we learne,
                     1 That though we be neuer ſo well inſtructed in the generall and particular duties belonging vnto vs, yet it is neceſſary that we ſhould be further exhorted to courage and conſtancy; a point which the Apoſtle obſerues in his Epiſtles, as 2 Theſ. 3.13. 1 Tim. 6.12. 2 Tim. 4.5, &amp;c. adding exhortations to the performance of duties before deliuered.
                     
                        Vſe, which we are to make, and is heere intended by the Apoſtle, is that we ſhould giue diligent heed to that which is heereafter to be deliuered, becauſe by it, all things before will be made profitable.
                     2 In that the Apoſtle layeth downe theſe things in the laſt place, bringing them vnto the ground of h

                        ſſe of his affection.
                     His humility appeares, in that hee makes them all equall vnto himſelfe, 1 Cor. 3.1. For brethren, is a word of equality: ſo that although himſelfe were an Apoſtle,

a chiefe Apoſtle, a planter of the Churches, a father of thouſands, and in particular, a planter of this Church, and father vnto them; yea, (which is to be noted) though hee write to all ſorts, euen to children and ſeruants; yet neuertheleſſe, in regard of that prerogatiue that God had giuen them to be his children, he calleth them all brethren. That this is a good collection, appeares by Mat. 23.8. where Chriſt reproouing the arrogancy of the Scribes and Phariſes that tooke oth
                           •
                        r Titles, and magnified themſelues aboue other, bringing this reaſon, (yee are all brethren,) Heb. 2.11.
                     
                        Vſe. That we take this for an example of humility, Rom. 12.16. for this humility is a vertue that commends vs to God and man, making vs ſociable, and keeping vs from diſdaine and contempt, &amp;c.
                     2 Hee labours by Loue to perſwade them to theſe duties, though hee might haue commanded them: as Philemon verſ. 8, 9. for brethren is a token of loue, and this word (my) ads an emphaſis to his affection: So 1 Cor. 15.58. he calls them beloued brethre

                        Vſe. For our imitation, that we doe teſtifie, and manifeſt our loue and gentleneſſe, that our perſwaſions may haue the more force, and be the better embraced, and like ſowre pilles couered with ſugar, the more willingly receiued. 2 Note heere the difference of the ſpirit of the world, in reſpect of Chriſt: for they ſcorne this name of brethren. So much for the manner.

                        Doct. Valour and courage, is needfull for the performance of all Chriſtian duties. This was commanded to Ioſhua, Ioſh. 1.6. Which, that it is not meant by an outward bodily courage, but of a ſpirituall, appeares by the

                     For our further incouragement, marke the amplification (In the power of his might.)
                     Some take theſe as for a cauſe, and the effect, viz. might to be the cauſe of power, power to be meant of ſtrength which is in vs, and might to be in the Lord: as if hee had ſaid, In that power which yee receiue from the Lord. But 1 this is a curious diſtinction without ground. 2 It is the Apoſtles purpoſe here, to raiſe vp our minds out of our ſelues, to a higher power without vs, and aboue vs: Wherefore it is rather an Hebraiſme, and ſo it is tranſlated by ſome (his mighty power:) like as in the 1 chapter ver. 19. So that it addes an emphaſis, ſhewing this power of the Lord to be a moſt Almighty power.
                     
                        Doct. That the power of God whereto wee truſt,

                        Vſe. It ſerues for our encouragement to ſtrengthen our faith, that wee may truſt ſecurely vnto it: which is to be noted. 1 In regard of our owne weakeneſſe.

                         In regard of our enemies, who are many and mighty.
                     2 It anſwers that obiection of our aduerſaries, that blame our Chriſtian confidency, as arrogant preſumption. This were indeed ſo, if wee did relye vpon our

owne ſtrength. Such an opinion had ſome of Dauids confidency, 1 Sam. 17.28, 37.
                     Now followes the Direction concerning ſuch means as wee are to ſeeke vnto our ſelues, expreſsed, ver. 11. Wherein in generall are layd down thoſe means wherby wee may bee fenced, and armed againſt our ſpirituall enemies. The parts are two.
                     
                        1 A Direction.
                        2 Motiues drawne from the end.
                     
                     In the Direction obſerue, 1 What is the meanes, viz Armour. 2 How this meanes is to bee vſed. Put it on. In the meanes note. 1 The Metaphor, (Armour.) 2 The quality of it, (of God)
                     Concerning the Metaphor, it is taken from ſoldier
                           •
                         that are among their enemies, either fighting, or looking for a combat, who for feare of being wounded, will arme themſelues; and being armed, they dare reſiſt their enemies, and feare them not: ſo Chriſtians, being the Lords ſoldiers, placed in this world, the Lords field, to fight againſt many enemies, that haue many weapons to wound vs, this armour is lent vnto them, wherewith they may bee fenced, &amp;c. The parts of which armour are in briefe, the ſanctifying graces of Gods holy Spirit, as wee ſhall ſee hereafter.
                     Hence wee learne, 1 That,
                     
                        Doct. The life of a Chriſtian is a warfare, 2 Tim. 2.

Their tentations are called aſſaults and fights, as here, and 1 Pet. 2.11. And hence is the diſtinction of militant and triumphant Church.
                     Now God hath thus diſpoſed of vs. 1 That his power might bee the more manifeſt. 2 That he might make tryall of the grace beſtowed on

                        by we are fenced, is diuine and ſpirituall armour, 2 Cor. 10.4. This will appeare by the deſcription of the parts.

                        . But many Saints haue beene foiled (as Dauid. Peter, &amp;c.) the deuill hath found a hole where to wound them, and therefore it ſeemes they had no compleate armour.
                     
                        Anſ. This comes to paſſe, not through any defect in the armour, but through their owne weakeneſſe, and want of skill in vſing of it, or careleſneſſe in not putting it on: yet that this armour is compleate, and no piece wanting for any part, appeares plainely in this: That all were not wound

For hereby, 1 We ſhould denie Gods prouidence, that he were not carefull to prouide all things needfull. 2 That he is wiſe, to know what is wanting. 3 That he is carefull of his children, th

                        The Ʋſe is in this, that wee muſt put it on: Which implyes 2 things. 1 That this a
                           •
                        mour muſt be put on.
                     2 That it muſt bee put on euery piece and part of it. (Put on the whole.)
                     Hee followes the metaphor ſtill; that wee muſt doe as ſoldiers doe, who put their armour vpon their backs,

and let it not like houſe-keepers in time of peace, hang by the walles and ruſt. So by this puting off this ſpirituall armour, is meant a vſing and imploying of the graces, that it is not ſufficient to knowe were this armour is to bee had if neede bee, and where it is layd vp, and ſo to diſcourſe of it; but this puting on, is a word of action and practice.
                     
                        Doct. 1 Chriſtians ought to exerciſe the graces of God, and to put them in triall and practice, Rom. 13.12. 1 Theſ. 5.8. C
                              •
                           l. 3 12. viz. ſhew it, let others feele that thou haſt the bowels of mercy, Rom. 13.14. viz. make Chriſt his merits, and his graces yours. Another metaphor is vſed to this end, 2 Tim. 1.6. (Stirre vp the gift) taken from fire which, muſt bee blowed, before it can burne and flame, that wee may receiue heat. Alſo another metaphor, Mat. 12.35. a man that hath great treaſure, and let it not lie ſtill ruſting and cancring, but bring it forth to the good of himſelfe and others.
                     The reaſon is, Becauſe all the good that comes vnto vs from the graces of God, is by the vſe of them. So though pearles, money, &amp;c. bee good in themſelues, yet they bring no benefit to the poſſeſſor of them, if they be layd vp in the treaſury and be not brought forth.
                     
                        Vſe. That we doe not deceiue our ſelues, boaſting that wee haue armour, and yet neuer vſe any: as many will ſay, they haue as ſtrong a faith as any, yet doe they not liue by ſence, heaping vp together, and onely caring for the things of this world; and if croſſes doe come, where is their ſhield then? doth not euery dart pierce them to the heart? &amp;c.
                     2 To teach vs, that whatſoeuer armour wee haue, to haue it ſtill vpon our backes. Haue wee the helmet of ſaluation, that is, hope of eternall life? let vs ſhew it, in moderating our deſires of the things of this life; becauſe wee ſtill looke for a better, Gen. 49.18.
                     
                        Doct. 2 It is not ſufficient for Chriſtians to put on a piece of this armour; but all muſt be put on, that is, we

muſt haue all the needfull &amp; ſanctifying graces of Gods Spirit, Epheſ. 4.15, 24. We are exhorted to put on the whole new man. Now theſe graces are as members of this n
                           •
                        w man; wherefore, as in naturall bodies there is a proportionall growth of all members in the body, and if all the growth be in the head, or in the legges, &amp;c. that man may be called a monſter: ſo muſt we grow and increaſe in all ſpirituall graces together, and not in one alone; for if there be all faith, and no charity, great knowledge, and no obedience, much deuotion, but little diſcretion: there is ſome corrupt humour, that thus turneth all the nouriſhment to one part.
                     
                        Obiect. But is it poſſible that one man ſhould haue all graces?
                     
                        Anſw. Yea, it is poſſible, and neceſſary: as the Apoſtle teſtifieth of the Corinthians, ſee 1 Cor. 5.7. For the Spirit ſanctifieth a man throughout: So that as a child hath all the parts of a man, though not in that ſtrength and bigneſſe: ſo haue the Children of God all graces, though ſome in greater, ſome in leſſer meaſure.
                     Reaſons, why this armour is thus wholly to be put on, are
                     1 Becauſe God hath made nothing in vaine; and therefore ſeeing hee hath made armour compleat, for to couer euery part. and hath preſcribed it vnto vs, we are therefore to put it all on, becauſe he hath made it for vs: for will not a Captaine take it in euill part, if when himſelfe hath prouided armour for all his ſoldiers, they come neuerthel
                           •
                        ſſe into the field vnarmed?
                     2 Our owne neceſſity: for if wee haue not on euery piece thereof, the diuell will quickely finde out that part which is vnarmed, and ſo wound vs, and ouerthrow vs.
                     3 So vnſeparably are graces knit and linked together, that he that hath not all, hath none. For what is faith without righteouſneſſe, but meere preſumption?
                     
                        Vſe is that ſame that Saint Peter makes, 2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7. viz. to ioyne all graces together, &amp;c.

                     IN this verſe is laid downe, 1 The kind of this combate, vnder the metaphor of wreſtling: implying that it is a very ſore combate.
                     
                        2 The Parties that maintaine this ſight: who are either ſuch as defend themſelues: expreſſed in this word (We) that is, all Chriſtians whatſoeuer, the miniſters themſelues not excepted: as appeares by changing of the perſon from (Yee) to (We,) the Apoſtle thereby not excepting himſelfe.
                     2 Or ſuch as aſſault. Theſe are deſcribed, 1 Negatiuely: (not againſt fleſh, and blood:) where, by fleſh and blood is vnderſtood, 1 The ſubſtance of fleſh and blood. 2 Thoſe things that are as fleſh and blood, that is to ſay, weake, fraile, and mortall.
                     Heereby is implyed, that our ſpirituall enemies are more than fleſh and blood, of more might and valour than all the men of the world: as by comparing the malice and power of the diuell, with that of men, may appeare.
                     
                        Vſe. It ſerues to ſtirre vp our dulneſſe, and to make vs more watchfull, hauing to doe with ſo mighty enemies.
                     2 When wee haue to deale with wicked men, to conſider that wee haue not onely to ſtriue with fleſh and blood, but alſo with the chiefe enemy the diuell, who is the principall worker, and whoſe inſtruments wicked men are: and ſo not to bite the ſtone that is caſt, but to haue an eye to him that throweth it. Further, from the oppoſition of theſe two parts, (Not againſt fleſh, &amp;c. but, &amp;c.) ariſeth this inſtruction:
                     
                        Doct. That they who are quailed and daunted by fleſh and blood, will neuer be able to ſtand out againſt Principalities and powers.
                     
                     Which is to be noted againſt the cowardlineſſe of men, that are mooued with euery temptation. For the feare of men. Wee ſee that I

                     1 The Ground of it. It hath pleaſed God thus to arme them with power. 1 In his iuſt iudgement for the puniſhment of the wicked. 2 For the tryall of his children. 3 For the manifeſtation of his power, in the aſſiſting of them. 4 That the excellency of his graces, wherewith hee armeth his children, might be ſeene, that they are armour of proofe to defend them.

                        Anſwer. No: for we ſee, that when there hath beene oppoſition betweene the good and the euill angels, the euill haue ſtill beene foiled, as Dan. 10. Reu. 12. So that if compariſon be made between them and the good Angels, their power is ſomewhat abated: but if compariſon be made betweene them and other creatures, their power ſtill remaines ſo great, that wee cannot ſee wherein it is any whit leſſened. And therefore wee are not to bee ſecure, as if his power were ſo weakned, that hee could not hurt vs ſince his fall; but to be ſtirred vp to watchfulneſſe, and to bee ſtrengthened in faith, ſeeing God hath giuen vs the good Angels to protect and defend vs.
                     3 The reſtraint of their power. In which we are to conſider, 1 what they cannot doe.
                     
                        Queſt. Whether can they goe beyond nature, or againſt it?
                     
                        Anſw. They cannot, becauſe they are creatures, and muſt bee ſubiected vnto the order ſet downe by God, who is the onely Lord of nature, and only can alter it, goe aboue and beyond it. Examples in 4 points.
                     1 The deuill cannot do that which is ſimply, and properly a miracle: as to cauſe that flaming fire ſhould not burne, to raiſe the dead: for theſe are againſt and aboue nature. And to doe theſe, is a property of God, whereby

                        Doct. 2 Seeing that we are bidden take this armour, and ſo reſiſt, we learn, That without this armour it is in vaine to reſiſt, we ſhall ruſh like horſes vpon the pikes, we fight like nak
                           •

                        Vſe. As before we
                           •
                         were taught to reſiſt, ſo here we are ſhewed how to reſiſt: not fooliſhly truſting in our owne ſtrength, but armed with the power of God.
                     
                        Doct. 3 That wee giue no place to the diuell: for ſuch is his ſuttlety and cruelty, that hee knowes how to take euery aduantage, and being once entered, like a fierce lion will deuoure vs.
                     
                        
                           Ʋſe. It reproues the folly of thoſe that will yeeld a little, and hope well enough to recouer themſelues, but ſinne growes by degrees, and the diuell gets great aduantage, by perſwading vs to yeeld a little: and if wee ſinne a little, and ſo loſe our ground, wee ſhall finde it a harder matter to recouer it, being loſt, then to haue kept it at the firſt.
                     3 The Time is noted in theſe words (In the euill day) not euill in it ſelfe, but in regard of thoſe occurrences that fall out vpon that day. Some take this to bee meant of the whole courſe of our life: others too ſtrictly, for the houre of our death. I rather take it in a middle ſence, for a certaine time or day, namely, the day of tryall and temptation, wherein we are aſſaulted by the diuell, who would bring vs to the euill of ſinne and of puniſhment; 
                           •
                        nd therefore it is called euill.
                     
                        Doct. Hence wee learne in generall, that there is an euill day that will come vpon vs, as Reu. 6.11. And ther

through many afflictions enter into the Kingdome of God. Herein alſo is the difference between the Church militant, and the Church triumphant. Y

                        Doct. 2 That wee muſt prepare, and be alwaies armed for an euill day. Thus Iob thought of his afflictions before they came, Iob 3.25. Thus Paul prepared for his afflictions, Acts 20.22, &amp;c. And ſo doth hee warne Timothy, 1 Tim. 1.18.
                     
                        Vſe. For reproofe of thoſe that liue ſecurely, thinking that all peace and quietneſſe ſhall ſtill laſt: and ſo like the people of Laiſh, Iudg. 18. are eaſily ſurprized. So much for the firſt degree.
                     In the ſ
                           •
                        cond obſerue 1 The Time. 2 The iſſue or benefit. The Time is expreſſed in theſe words, (hauing finiſhed all things.) Wherein we may note, 1 the Action, 2 the Obiect, (all things.)
                     
                        Doct. The inſtruction from thence is, that the aſſaults made againſt vs are many: (all,) as Pſal. 34.19. The Commonwealth of Iſrael was a type of this, which was continually exerciſed with afflictions in Egypt, and afterwards till they came to be in quiet in the Land of Canaan. And this is alſo verified in the life of Chriſt, his Prophets and Apoſtles. So then, as there is an euill day certainely to be looked for; ſo likewiſe are there many to be vndergone of vs. Wherein,
                     1 God doth ſhew his goodneſſe in aſſiſting and deliuering vs, and the truth of his promiſes, in not forſaking vs.

                     2 That we may pray. The meanes are, verſe 18. Before wee come to the particular handling of theſe points, obſerue here the coherence, and ioyning together of theſe two duties, Stand and pray. Whereby we learne, that as on the oe ſide wee ſhould not be faint-hearted, timorous, and careleſſe: ſo on the other wee be hot proud a

                        d inſolent, truſting, and preſuming on our owne ſtrength. The firſt ſhewes that God will not helpe vs, vnleſſe wee labour and endeauour to doe our beſt The ſecond ſhewes, that we can doe nothing without the helpe of God. We muſt pray, ſo truſting to God, to his promiſes and mighty power: that we alſo ſtand, that is, vſe the meanes that hee hath preſcribed. Againe, we muſt ſo vſe the meanes, alwaies hauing an eye vnto God: So neither tempting by neglect of the meanes, nor preſuming on the meanes to be careleſſe in ſeeking helpe of God. This was notably repreſented vnto vs, in that firſt battell of the Iſraelites with the Amalekites. Exod. 17. where Ioſhua was fighting, and Moſes praying both together. See the like, 2 Chron. 14.10, 11.
                     
                        
                        Vſe is for vs, that we doe not ſeparate thoſe things that God hath ioyned together.

                           •
                        ken from the manner of ſtanding in warre. Wee heard it vſed before, verſe 13. but not in the ſame Mood nor Tenſe; and ſo not in the ſame ſignification. There it was in the Infinitiue: here it is in the Imparatiue: there is meant ſtanding after the fight; heere, in the very fight. Now this word implyes 4 things.
                     1 Courage in this Chriſtian warre; for timorous and faint-hearted ſoldiers are ready to fly away, where a man of valour will ſtand it out.
                     2 An abiding in that place and ranke wherein our Captaine Chriſt Ieſus hath ſet vs, and not to ſtraggle from it.
                     3 Watchfulneſſe. Not to be ſluggiſh, to lye downe and ſleepe, but to ſtand on our feet.
                     4 A kinde of continuance and conſtancy. Not to be ſtill putting off and on of our armour, but to keepe it on ſtill.
                     From whence accordingly wee are to obſerue foure duties.
                     1 Chriſtian ſoldiers muſt be of a valourous and couragious minde, to ſtand againſt, and to defie their enemies. Such courage as Dauid had againſt Goliah: which how needful it is in all things, appeares, in that the Lord doth ſo often vrge to Ioſhua, euen three times together, Ioſhua 1.6, 7, 9.
                     Reaſons. 1 In regard of our enemies, who are daunted with nothing more, than with courage and valour, and inſult ouer vs when wee are timorous: like the Woolfe that flies away if he be reſiſted, but if you runne away, hee ſets vpon you eagerly.
                     2 In regard of other, vnto whom our valour may be a great encouragement: as 2 Chron. 11 14.
                     
                        Vſe. To be exhorted to the performance of this duty,

and for motiues to ſtirre vs vp to conſider,

                     3 That euery part before is couered from top to toe.
                     Hence wee learne three inſtructions.
                     1 That Chriſtians muſt more ſeeke to defend themſelues, and maintaine their owne, than to annoy their enemies. Thus did Chriſt, when hee made himſelfe our example in his firſt conflict with Satan: we ſee Satan firſt ſ

                        ts vpon him, he onely defends himſelfe: and thus haue the ſeruants of God dealt with the inſtruments of the diuell from time to time. This is an argument that our cauſe is iuſt.
                     2 That in this Chriſtian warre and conflict, we

                        at armour for the forepart: a helmet, comprehending the beauer and gorget, to couer the head and face downe to the neck. A breſtplate, containing vnder it the ſkirts or baſes, to couer all vnto the knees. The Greaues or Bootes to couer the legges vnto the ſole of the foot. For th

                           •
                        ſtruction is, that the graces of Gods Spirit, that hee beſtowes vpon vs, are ſufficient to defend and keepe vs ſafe: So that this being compleat and ſufficient armour, wee need not ſeeke further to adde any thing to it, to make vs bold and couragious. So much in generall.
                     Now wee come diſtinctly to handle the parts: wherein wee will obſerue this order:
                     1 To declare what are thoſe graces heere meant, by the parts of the armour.
                     2 To ſhew how fitly thoſe graces are reſembled vnto the m

                     3 To gather the vſes and inſtructions ariſing therefrom. The firſt, in that order, that the Apoſtle hath ſet them downe, is the Girdle of ver

                           ty, or truth. To omit other ſignification, there is a foure-fold truth heere meant. 1 Of Iudgement, and Opinion. 2 Of heart and affection. 3 Of words. 4 Of deeds and actions. All which are as linkes of one, and the ſame chaine, and muſt concurre, to make vp the ſtrength and beauty of this Girdle.
                     
                     1 Truth of opinion and iudgement, is that whereby

wee doe maintaine and vphold the Word of God and true Religion grounded thereon. In a word, it is ſoundneſſe in Religion, in Doctrine, ſoundneſſe in faith and b

                     2 Truth of affection, is a kinde of inward honeſty and ſi

                        cerity, when we ſet God before our ey
                           •
                        s alwaies, and our ſelues in his preſence: and ſo, though we be alone, yet carry our ſelues that we may be accepted and approoued of him, Pſal. 5.6. This was in Ioſeph, when hee was tempted, and in Hezekiah, 2 King. 20.3.
                     3 Truth in ſpe
                           •
                        ch, is, when the words which wee vtter, be agreeable to our minde and intention, and alſo to the matter ſpoken of: for elſe wee tell a lye, or an vntruth. Wherefore wee muſt vtter that which wee know to be a truth, Epheſ. 4.25. Rom. 9 1. 1 Tim. 2 7.
                     4 Truth in action, is, when wee deale plainely and faithfully, not hypocritically; whether we haue to doe with God in his worſhip, or otherwiſe with men: not pretending more than in truth we doe intend, 1 Iohn 3.18. Epheſ. 4.24. (True holineſſe.) Thus is Nathaniel commended for a plaine honeſt man, Iohn 1.47.
                     All theſe muſt be lin
                           •
                        ed together: and if you take away any one, the Girdle breakes, and loſeth his ſtrength and comelineſſe. For, though the heart be ſincere, the ſpeech true, the Actions plaine and honeſt; yet if the iudgement be vnſound, and we be carried away to errour, ſuperſtion and Idolatry, all thoſe faire ſhewes will prooue but ſtubble and droſſe. Paul thought that hee had an honeſt heart, and was vnrebukeable for his conuerſation, Acts 26 9. but being miſſe-led in iudgement, what did this auaile him? He afterwards eſteemed it nothing.
                     Againe, though we hold the truth, if we haue a double heart, full of hypocriſie and diſſimulation, wee are the more odious and abominable to God, and our knowledge ſhall ſerue as a witneſſe to condemne vs.
                     Moreouer, if we will ſeem ſound in heart &amp; opinion,

yet lie in word, diſſemble and deale double in our actions, what doe wee but diſgrace the truth, and plainely profeſſe our ſelues hypocrites?

                        rity, when our heart, word, and deede agree in one, and all inlightened and directed by the Word. So that truth in iudgement is the fountaine, theſe the ſtreames.

                     1 As it is taken from trauellers; who in the Eaſterne hot parts vſed to goe in long ſide garments, and therefore when they iourneyed, did truſſe them vp to their loynes with a girdle, as Luk 12.35. Exod. 12.11. This is not meant here.
                     2 As it is taken from ſoldiers, for the knitting and faſt girding of their Armour cloſe together about: as Iob 38.3. In this ſence is it here taken. Now ſoldiers vſe to haue a ſtrong girdle called a belt to gird their harneſſe about them, and it hath a double vſe.
                     
                        Vſe. 1 For Ornament: becauſe the armour is ioyned together about the middle with ioynts; and therefore to couer thoſe ioynts which are not ſo comely, they vſe a broad girdle. 2 For ſtrength. 1 For that it ſerues to keepe the armour cloſe and faſt together, that in the ſight it fall not off, or comber him. 2 For that it doth much ſtrengthen a man, to haue his loynes and middle faſt girded about.

                        deth this) then truth in the inward parts, an honeſt, ſingle, ſimple heart? For this cauſe was Dauid a man after Gods owne heart, Acts 13.22. becauſe hee had an vpright heart, 1 King. 15.3. For this cauſe did Noah finde fauour with God, Gen. 6 9.
                     Againe, what Learning, Art, or Eloquence can more grace a mans ſpeech, then truth?

This vpheld Iob, although his wife and his friends counted him an hypocrite, and although the hand of God was heauy vpon him. Iob. 27.5. and 31.35.

                     4 The order of our actiōs, whether we firſt begin with our ſelues, before we ſeek to vrge the ſame things vpon others; not as the Scribes, that lay heauy burdens vpon others, which themſelues would not touch, Mat. 23.4.
                     Now vpon this tryall, if wee finde that in any of theſe reſpects wee want truth, then muſt wee buy it, that is, vſe all meanes to attaine vnto it, although it be with the loſſe of thoſe things which wee haue: as they that buy, muſt depart with ſome things: which is notably ſet foorth in two parables, Mat. 13.44, 45, 46.
                     Motiues to ſtirre vs vp to get it are,
                     1 The excellency of this treaſure. This notably commends the excellency of it, in that nothing makes vs more like vnto God than this, who is truth it ſelfe; and ſo nothing makes vs more amiable vnto him. Againe, it makes vs like vnto thoſe that are like to God: as the Saints and Angels in heauen. Contrariwiſe, nothing

makes ſo vs like the diuell as vntruth, Iohn 8.44. The excellency of it appeares alſo heerein, that there is no grace (I dare ſ
                           •
                        y) in the Scripture ſo much vrged, as this of truth.
                     2 The need that wee haue of it; for all other graces without it, are in vaine: they are corrupt, and putrified, if they be not ſeaſoned with truth; therefore are wee exhorted to loue vnfained, to faith vnfained, &amp;c. So that this attribute of truth doth commend euery grace, 1 Iohn 3.18.
                     3 The benefit that comes by hauing of it; for the leaſt meaſure of grace ſeaſoned with it, is accepted of God, Pſal. 51 6. and 145.18. yea, bl

                     1 For truth in iudgement: wee muſt doe as men vſe to do that would buy any thing, they will go to the place where it is to be had, and vſe the meanes to get it. Now the contrary, where this pearle is to be had, is the Church, the mould wherein it is hid, is the Word of God; and the miniſtery thereof, is the meanes to diſcouer and make it knowne vnto vs: there needs then but our attention and diligence to reſort vnto theſe meanes. Siluer &amp; Gold there needs none to get it, though this alſo ſometimes we muſt not ſpare for the obtaining of it.
                     2 For ſincerity, let our care be to doe, as Enoch did to walke with God, to ſet our 
                           •
                        elues alwaies in his preſence: the conſideration whereof will make vs

                     Now, hauing once gotten this Girdle, let it be our care and endeauour to keepe it faſt, and not to looſe it. Not to ſe

                        l it, that is, not to exchange it for any thing whatſoeuer. To take nothing for it, becauſe nothing is worth it: be it eaſe, riches, or the like.
                     Which we are to note the more diligently, becauſe if wee once haue this grace, the diuell will labour by all meanes to coozen vs of it: for this is that for which

onely he feareth vs; and therefore there is nothing that hee more oppoſeth againſt, by diuers ſuttleties and temptations, than againſt truth and ſincerity.

                        ſt be ioyned with the former: as the particle (And) ſheweth. For verity is, as hath beene ſhewed, like ſalt. Now righteouſneſſe is that which it ſeaſons. This is the ſubſtance vpon which that doth worke, that reſpects on
                           •
                        ly the manner of working. In handling whereof, wee will conſider theſe poynts.
                     1 What this righteouſneſſe is.
                     
                        Righteouſneſſe is a holy quality wrought in vs by the Spirit of God, whereby we do conforme our ſelues to the whole Law of God. Sometime in Scripture, this word hath relation only to the duties of the ſecond Table, but then it hath alwaies ſome other word ioyned vnto it, that hath reference to God: as (holineſſe,) Luk. 1.75. Eph. 4.24. or it is reſtrained to that ſignification, by the circumſtances of the place, as Deu. 24.13. But when it is ſet alone, it doth reſpect the whole Law; both the duties to God, and alſo to men, Mat. 5.20. This is that which we call Iuſtice, wherby we giue vnto euery man his due. Now the Law ſhewes what is due from vs to God, to others, and to our ſelues: So that it cannot be better defined, than a conformity to the whole Law of God.
                     
                        Obiect. But then this is ſuch a piece of armour, as neuer any did attaine vnto it, vnleſſe it were Adam, Eccleſ. 7.31. Gen. 1.26. the Saints in heauen, Hebr. 22.23. and Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, Act. 22.14. Eſa. 59.17. But of others, that of the Apoſtle, Rom. 10.5. is true. There is none righteous, no not one. How then are we

exhorted to put on this breſtplate?
                     
                        Anſw. There is a double righteouſn
                           •
                        ſſe mentioned in the Scripture. 1 A Legall righteouſneſſe performed according to the rule &amp; rigor of the Law. 2 An Euangelicall righteouſneſſe, in a gracious acceptance according to the limitations of the Goſpell. The former is a full and perfect fulfilling of the Law, in all and euery point and degree thereof, by a mans owne ſelfe, Rom. 10.5. Gal. 3.10, 12.
                     But the righteouſneſſe of the Goſpell mitigates the ſeuerity therof, and ſets forth vnto vs a twofold righteouſnes
                           •
                         1 Of faith, Rom. 10.6, &amp;c. which is meant here, but in the 6 verſe, where it is compared to a Shield.
                     2 Of a good conſcience, which is that powerfull worke of the Spirit, Gal. 5.22. in the regenerate, when by the endeauor to approoue themſelues vnto God, by doing thoſe things that the Law requireth, Act. 24.16 Hebr. 13.18, This is heere meant, and it conſiſteth in two things. 1 The abſtaining from euill, all things offenſiue to God, and hurtfull to man. 2 The doing of good; for thoſe two muſt alwaies be ioyned together, to make vp this breſtplate, Pſal 119.3.
                     2 The ſecond point to be conſidered, is how fitly the grace is reſembled to the metaphor.
                     The word 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         heere vſed, ſignifieth that part of the body, wherein are contained the vitall parts, the heart, lungs, liuer, &amp;c. which being wounded, there is no hope of life, from the necke to the midſt, or to the nauell. Hence is the word alſo vſed for that piece of the armour that couereth this part. The vſe then of of a breſtplate, is to keepe the vitall parts from being mortally wounded, that a man be not ſtricken downe without recouery. The ſame vſe hath righteouſn
                           •
                        ſſe, to keepe the ſoule, from being deadly wounded with the darts of the diuell, that the poyſon thereof doe not pierce thorow the very heart and life of grace, and quite extinguiſh it. For ſinne, and nothing elſe is that

which mortally woundeth the ſoule, and puls Gods wrath vpon vs. Now from this, righteouſneſſe preſerues vs, becauſe by it we doe auoyd ſinne.
                     3 The 3 point is, how we muſt put on this breſtplate.
                     There is no better way, than by the right practice of true repentance; for repentance is a change and alteration of the minde, and ſuch a change as brings foorth a reformation in our liues. Whence is both an vtter deteſtation and abiuration of all euil, and a conſtant reſolution to enter into a new courſe of life, forſaking all former wickedneſſe. Now where this is indeed, the diuell will not eaſily, or not at all preuaile againſt vs. Otherwiſe, if it be wanting, our ſwiniſh and doggiſh nature will ſtill remaine; ſo that howſoeuer thoough ſome iudgement of God, or other occaſion, we may for a time leaue ſinne, yet ſhall we eaſily returne to it againe.
                     4 The fourth point is, What is the benefit and vſe of this breſtplate?
                     Surely great, and much euery manner of way. 1 In regard of the compariſon of it to a breſtplate, becauſe it defends our ſoules from being mortally wounded, and thruſt thorow with ſinne: Becauſe ſuch as haue this righteouſneſſe, will endeauour to auoyde all things that wound the conſcience, and to doe all things that preſerue, cheere and comfort it.
                     
                        Obiect. But doe we not ſee, that they who haue been moſt circumſpect and carefull, haue falne into ſinne, as Dauid, and Peter, &amp;c? How then doth this keepe vs from being wounded?
                     
                        Anſw. It doth not keepe a man from being wounded, but from being deadly wounded: for howſoeuer they may commit ſinnes that are groſſe in themſelues, yet in them they are not groſſe ſinnes, being committed through infirmity, violence of temptation, want of watchfulneſſe, not with full conſent and deſire, &amp;c. So that although they be wounded, yet it is not incurable at the heart.
                     
                        Yea, by theſe wounds they grow the more ſtrong and ſound, increaſing hereby in greater feare and care to pleaſe God. It keepes them not altogether from ſinne, but from giuing vp themſelues to ſinne, that it doe not ſo ſeaze vpon them, as to ſoake to the h
                           •
                        art, and ſucke vp the bloud and life of grace.
                     2 It ſerues to giue vnto vs an aſſured euidence of our ſpirituall vnion with Chriſt; from whom wee haue this power and this grace, and ſo is it a token of our effectuall calling, and of our eternall election, 2 Pet. 1.10. 1 Ioh. 2.29. And by conſequent, of our euerlaſting ſaluation. Which aſſurance makes vs bold &amp; confident.
                     3 By this wee get a good name while wee liu
                           •
                        , and when w

                     4 This is a great honour and ornament vnto our Chriſtian profeſſion, really confirming the truth of it, when our practice is anſwerable to our profeſſion.

                     3 This conceit of merit doth ſo putrifie righteouſneſſe, that it maketh it odious to God, being directly contrary to the free grace of God, and Alſufficient merit of Chriſt, Rom. 11. Gal. 2.
                     4 That it is only a way which the Lord hath appointed vs to walke, to teſtifie our obedience and thankefulneſſe to God, that we might profit our brethren, and haue euidence and aſſurance of our faith, and effectuall calling.
                     5. In all workes of righteouſneſſe, let vs compare them with the rule thereof, viz. the Law, ſo ſhall wee ſee how imperfect they are, and how farre ſhort they come of that which is required. This will humble vs▪

                     1 By ſuggeſting vnto vs that it is a needleſſe piece of armour, becauſe Chriſt hath ſatisfied all, and fulfilled the whole Law for vs, and hath left nothing for vs to doe; ſo that if we haue faith, it is ſufficient for vs. Thu

                        To auoide this, conſider, That though our righteouſneſſe be no meritorious cauſe of ſaluation, yet it is a way wherein wee are to walke; though wee are not ſaued by it, yet wee cannot be ſaued without it, 1 Cor. 6.9. Heb. 12.14. Tit. 2.12. Ioh. 3.3. Luk. 1.75. Epheſ. 2.10. 1 Theſ. 4.7. Tit. 3.14. (Neceſſary.)
                     2 That God hath made nothing in vaine, and therefore if he haue made as well the breſtplate of righteouſneſſe, as the ſhield of faith, wee are to vſe both: Yea it is certaine, that hee that hath not the breſtplate of right

                     2 By perſwading vs, that it is a comberſome and toyleſome matter, a great hinderance to our honour and promotion, our gaine, our eaſe and pleaſure, &amp;c. Thus did he deceiue Eſau, who is therefore called prophane, not regarding to be of the Church: and Demas, 2 Tim. 4.10. Thus doth hee deceiue the moſt in theſe times. To auoide this, wee muſt conſider the fruits and iſſue, rather then the preſent inconueniences. For no armour is like vnto apparell to be worne for pleaſure. But if we haue an eye vnto the iſſue, all the troubles that we can endure, are not worthy the bl

                     3 If thus he cannot preuaile, hee will obiect vnto vs, that it can be of no vſe, and ſtand vs in no ſtead at all, ſeeing that all our righteouſneſſe is but droſſe and dung, Eſay 64.6. Phil. 3.8. And by this meanes he bringeth many to deſperation.
                     For to auoyd this wile, we are to know that howſoeuer our righteouſneſſe be ſo indeed, if either it be compared to the Law of God and his iuſtice, or taken alone by it ſelfe in oppoſition to Chriſt, yet notwithſtanding as it is a fruite of Gods Spirit, as comming from

of God vnited to Chriſt; as it is a way wherein to walke to heauen; thus it is a matter whereby we may reape much comfort, giuing vs an euidence that we belong to Chriſt, although it be no matter of boaſting.
                     4 Hee hath yet a further wile, he will grant that it is needfull and of vſe: but yet wee need not be too ſtrict and carefull▪ if we haue ſome euidences of our faith, it is enough; the Lord will pardon, his mercy is great, &amp;c. A ſubtill wile, whereby many are dec

                         muſt conſider the nature of righteouſneſſe, that is, that chaine which holds vs vp from falling into hell. The linkes of this chaine are the duties of the Law: if one linke bee broken, downe wee fall into hell.

True: but the righteous ſinne by reaſon of the frailty of the fleſh, violence of temptation, &amp;c. yet he takes no liberty to ſinne, with full conſent, to liue and lye in it wilfully and wittingly; and therefore, 1 Ioh. 3.9 hee ſinneth not, that is, giueth not himſelfe ouer to any one ſinne.
                     2 Againe, we know not whether we ſhall euer turne to the Lord or no, or haue time and power to repent, if we refuſe to doe it, when God calleth vs.
                     5 O! But be not ouer-iuſt, leſt thou be deſolate, Eccle. 7.18. Men will forſake thy company, &amp;c.
                     But we muſt knowe that in true righteouſneſſe wee cannot be too ſtrict in auoyding of thoſe things that are ſeene indeed, and in doing of thoſe duties that are duties indeed. But this is meant, when wee will make a righteouſneſſe of our owne, and make more ſinnes than God euer made. No maruell then if wee be forſaken. Otherwiſe wee ſhall be ſure to haue fellowſhip with Gods Spirit, with the good Angels, with the Saints in heauen hereafter.

This is ſet down by this deſcription, (The preparation of the Goſpell of peace.) Preparation, or, becauſe by it the heart of man is ſettled, fixed, and reſolued to goe on in the way, what impediments ſoeuer are in it.
                     
                        Of the Goſpel.) Becauſe it is the Goſpel that doth ſettle the heart: this brings good tidings, Luk. 2.10. Of what? That God hath giuen his Sonne for vs, ver. 11. that his wrath is pacified towards vs, that our ſinnes are forgiuen vs. This is that God, which when once we know, our hearts are fully reſolued to beare all things, ſeeing that now nothing can make vs miſerable.
                     
                        Of peace) Both in regard of the ſubiect, and nature of it, in that it firſt made tender of peace to man, and ſtill declareth and publiſheth it.
                     2 And alſo of the effect, becauſe the Spirit of God, by the preaching of the Goſpell, pacifies the conſcience tormented with ſin: as was ſignified by the ſong of the Angels, Luk. 2.14. This is added, to ſhew the ground of true patience, viz. That it muſt bee grounded vpon the word of reconciliation, for then onely can the heart go on with courage and comfort in enduring all things.
