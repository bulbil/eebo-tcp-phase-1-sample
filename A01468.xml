            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            ¶From Roane by Michaelwood,
Anno. M.D.Liii. the first
of October.
         
      
      
         
            
            MAny great men and potentates
of the worlde, when thei haue
by their vnlauful and vnrighteous
attemtes, brought themselues
into extreme miseries, haue at laste
much blamed their vnfortunable estate,
for that they in due time lacked coun
                  •
               el
to haue withdrawen them frō such enterprises.
So it is saide in the common
Prouerbe. That the riche and mightye
haue seldome good councell, excepte
they get it of thēselues. For riches and
hye dignitie causeth them to be more insolent, so that they can abide any thing
better, then to be tolde of theyr faultes,
and the rewarde of hym that shoulde
franckely tell them the truth: may soner
be a brokehead then otherwyse. Thys
prudent men perceyuing, rather wythdrawe
them selues from them, thē with
wearying them selues in vayne▪ procure
to them selues displeasure. And flatterers
seyng a redy pray at theyr handes,
dayly folowe vpon them, wyth vpholdyng
theyr dedes and woordes good or
bad Al is excellently deuised, prudentlye
spoken, done lyke a good man. &amp;c.
Thus wyth their owne pride climbyng▪
and with flattery pricked forward, thei
runne headlōg in their imaginatiōs, til
they tomble downe into the pyt of destructiō.
And then thei lay the blame frō
               
them selues to other. wher indede they
wold neuer heare other, but snch as serued,
yea rather deceyued theyr affections
wyth flatteries. But agaynst sutche
headstrōg hastynes we are admonished
by the holy Gost saying: Be not wise in
thine owne conceit. Fear God, &amp; depart
from euil. Thys we wysh that al menne
wold well consider in their enterprises.
First that ther is a God, not a blynd and
deafe god, as the godles Heithen painted
Iupiter at Create, but an euerliuyng
God that seeth all the wayes of Adams
children, that knoweth the oppress our
and him that is oppressed, that wyl call
all thynges into iudgemēt and to accōpt
and wyl render to euerye one his iust recompence
vpon hys head. Hym oughte
men to fear. For whatsoeuer thei attēpt
yet at last, that he determineth must cōe
to passe, and his wyl in all thynges shall
be accomplished. This I pray you to cō
               sider
now in dew time, least if you now
forget it, it may hereafter chaūce to you
as it hathe done to other▪ that in theyr
wealth lyttle studyed on these matters.
God hath maruelously saued you from
the handes of sutche as hated you, and
set you in hye dignitie, more then euer
you had in your lyfe. And doutles it is to
do good▪ and not euill, to correct and amend
thinges amisse, not to destroy and

breake downe thynges that are in good
case and order. Your procedinges begin
strangelye, in that you at the fyrst go about
to deface the holy woord of God,
to set asyde Christes institution, and to
cal al this realme to blindenesse and errour.
For if you take away the lyghte of
Gods woord from the worlde: what cā
men loke for at your hādes, but destruction
and errour? Dauid saith: thy worde
(O Lord) is a candel for my feete▪
               Psalm cxviii. Iohn. viii. and a
light for my steppes. And Christ sayeth:
he that foloweth me, walketh not in
darknes, but shal haue the lyght of life.
we knowe that you haue in tymes past
nothing fauored the Scriptures to be in
English, but haue euer winsed and kycked
against them, but our hope was that
once you wold amēd, considering how
Gods goodnes called you to repētance.
You were wont to alledge you dyd nothyng
but as a common Coūselour, yea
you obtested by God, that when menne
were burned for the truthes sake, you
nothyng procured to it, but dyd all that
you might to the cōtrari. we wer glad to
read this in your writīgs, but we besech
you let the same nowe appeare in your
dedes, so shal we the better beleue your
writinges. But if now you rayse a newe
persecution for the wordes sake, truely
it shal be manifest to al mē, that ye were

gilty of al the blod that hath bene shed
before time for the word of god. which
blod (though it be yet vnadueuged) yet
it remaineth fresh and new in the syght
of God, wyth Abels bloode crying vnto
God,ge. iii Ap. vi and with the bloode of the holye
Martirs saying: How longe tariest thou
Lorde holy and true, to iudge and to auenge
our blode on them that dwell on
the earth? Doute ye not but their crye is
heard and not forgottē afore God. For
he maketh inquisition for their bloode,Ps. ix.
and remembreth them, and forgetteth
not the complaint of the poore.i. Tim iii. Ezech xx xiii The office
of a Byshop is not to be a Butcher,
it is to preache Gods word, not to put it
downe, to help such as be captiues, not
to cast into pryson the ryghteouse that
are at liberty, to carry the poore lambes
vpō their shoulders, not to seke al meanes
possible to consume them with fyre
or halter. O miserable lambes that shall
haue sutch Shepherdes, whose study is
not to feede them, but to kepe them frō
the pasture of Gods word, and to poyson
them with dreames of mens imaginations.
O horrible iudgement of God,
that Christ and his Gospell shal be called
new learning and here sye. what can
the Turcke do more then rayle agaynste
Christ and blaspheme his holye Testament?
Yet must Christen men be compelled

to hear Antichrist, and to hold their
peace, when the blood of the new Testament is
blasphemed. what is in your
lattin Masse, to edify with the churche
of England?i. Co. xiiii S. Paule saith: that al thinges
read or doone in the common congregation,
should be done in that tonge
that the congregation vnderstandeth,
that the vnlearned may say Amen. And
Boner hath set vp agayne in Paules Salesburi
latin portace, wherof the lai men
vnderstādeth no word, and God knoeth
no more do the greater parte of the portas
patterers. we know that S, Paul had
the spirite of Christe, and what can we
iudge of Boner doing contrary to Saynt
Paules doctrine? Yf the most godly and
perfecte booke of seruice (whiche euen
you your selfe haue both in preachynge
and writing cōmended) please not him,
why doth he not set out his church seruice
in English? But he knoweth wel inough
that there is sutche monstruouse
thinges in it, that if it were in Englishe,
English boies woulde laughe it scorne.
Sutch lyes ar in the saītes legendes, such
manifest errours, that no coullour cā defend
them Yet muste these occupye the
place, and that in lattin to make symple
and plaine people beleue, that ther is in
the lattin tong▪ some priuy holy mistery
Truthe needeth no corners or clokes to

hide it selfe, nor to be in a straunge hid
tong, as errours euer seke the 
                  •••
               tes of
darknes to be their shield and defense
Euery one that doth euil (as Christ saieth)
hateth the lighte,Iho iii and cōmeth not
to the light, that his dedes should not
be reproued, but he that doth the truth
commeth to the light, that hys deedes
maye be knowen, for they are done in
god▪ Christ ordeined the holy cōmunion
that christen men shoulde together
eate the holy bread, and drinke the holy
cuppe in the remembraūce of his body
broken, and his blood shed. And S.
Paule deliuered to vs the same that he
receiued of the Lord, commaundynge
vs saying: as oft as ye shal eate of thys
bread, and drincke of this cup, ye shall
shew the Lordes death vntil he come.
I prai you, how is this obserued in your
priuate masses, wher your shauē prestes
(for the more parte) can as well buylde
Poules steple, as fulfil Poules cōmaundemēt.
you haue not one word of scripture
to maintaine this prophanation of
christes institution. And it is an horrible
and fearful thing that euer man mortall
should presume sutch great impietie against
the immortal and euerliuīg god.
you rage sore agaynst maried priestes
which haue for them gods woorde.i. cori. vii. but
you forget the vnchaste and detestable

Sodomies, incestes, aduoutries, fornications,
murdring of infants, that hath
bene foūd in the vnmaried sort of shaue
linges, which haue no word of god but
this: for sutche thinges sake, commeth
the wrath of god vpon the children of
vnbeliefe,Ephes. v. i. cori. vi. and. vii and whore mongers and aduouterers
shal not inherite the kingdōe
of Christ. You bishops shoulde laye no
snares to dampne mens soules, but rather
helpe them oute that be in sutche
dampnable estate, and that which gods
word leaueth at libertie, you ought not
to bring into bōdage. That you depriue
the maried prestes of their offices &amp; liuinges,
it is very straunge, and no word
of god haue ye so to dooe. And we nothing
doubt it, but thoughe god at this
present exercises the patiēce of his seruantes,
yet he wil at last remember hys
promise. For the rroubles sake of the
oppressed, and because of the cōplaint
of the poore, I wil vp (saith the Lorde)
I wyll helpe them,Psal. xi. and set them at rest.
And in Esai the lord saith: wo be to the
thou robber, shalte not thou be robbed
also?es. xxxiii. &amp; thou that despisest other, shalt
not thou also be despised? The lord wil
doutles heare the sorowful wepings of
the poore widdowes and fatherles children
which by this robbery are dryuen
to beggerie. The lord heareth the praier

of the oppressed (saieth Sirach,eccl. xxxv) He
wil not despise the praier of the fatherles, nor the widdowe lamentably complainyng
to hym. Doth not god see the
teares of the widdow, and hear her exclamation
against sutch as cause her to
wepe? from her cheke they ascend into
heauen, and the lorde that fauourablye
heareth her, wyll haue no pleasure in
them. For gods honor therfore, and for
feare of his iudgement, cal these things
to your minde, and somewhat mitigate
these hasty and rashe doinges, whiche
are against god &amp; his word.Eccl. xv. psalm. v. For though
the lord hath called you to be a scourge
to other, yet remember he cōmanudeth
you to do nothing vnrighteouselye, for
he is a god that willeth none vnrighteousenes:
their may no vngodly persone
dwell with him, sutch as be cruell, may
not stand in his sight. He is enemy vnto
al wicked doers. he destroieth the lyars
and abhorieth the bloode thirstye and
deceiteful. And as you now are reysed
to scourge others: so if you vexe the innocent,
doutles the lord will throw you
downe, and rayse vppe them that shall
scourge you againe, and fulfill Christes
worde:Mat. vii. Luk. vi. with what measure ye meate to
other, the same shalbe measured to you
againe. Remember we besech you, that

as glory groweth, so enuie against you
groweth, not of good, but of euell men,
who thoughe they nowe lyke Echo rebound
euer with pleasaūt soūd of your
owne voice, yet wil they (if god a little
withdrawe his hande from you) be the
first that shal reioyse at your fall. God
wil withdraw his hand from you, if you
repugne against his word, if you seeke
to deface his truth, to cast aside Christes
supper, to condempne mariage, to
set vp againe idolatrie, superstition and
errour, to bring in againe that sodomitical
fained chastetie, that drew infinite
vnto eternal dampnation. we neede not
recite vnto you exāples what god hath
done with princes and potentates, that
haue enterprised to resist his truthe, or
els to abuse it to their owne priuate lustes,
seing you haue not onely read, but
sene before your eyes. Onelye we praye
god you may remember what was said
to S. Paule. Saule Saule why persecutest
thou me? He saide: Lorde who art
thou? The lord saide: I am Iesus whom
thou persecutest,Act. ix. it shal be hard for the
to kicke against the pricke. It is the lord
Iesus that in his members suffereth, it
is his worde that is hated and persecuted,
it is he that mercifullye calleth you
to repentaunce, and he is able inoughe
to represse all violence done agaynste

him, but as he came from heauē to saue
sinners, so wolde he rather call Saule to
repentance, then cast Nero into destructiō.
But when al thinges shal declar you
impenitent, &amp; manifest rebellour against
godes worde, then without doubte the
lord wil no more spare you, thē he hath
before time spared other. For goddes
sake therfore beware in dew time and
take example at others, least other here
after take example at you.actes. i. Iudas betraying
the truth, purchased the blody feld,

how craftely do you cloine in this. you
wil commaunde no man, but they shall
say you, gratifie the quene. God graunt
the quenes grace plainly to se your falshoode,
we are afraid you wil bring the
wrath of god vpō her &amp; al this realm of
England, as the p̄stes &amp; ꝓphetes of Dan
&amp; bethel brought it vpō the kings of Israel

and Iuda. you tel the quene the people
is desirous of Masses, and that they
neuer fauoured the scriptures, and you
tell the people, the quencs pleasure is
that they receiue againe the masse and
poperie. Thus you cause no small number
of harts to be withdrawen frō that
harty loue and affectiō that thei ought
to beare to the quenes highnes, and as
mutch as in you is sowe the sede of discention,
which the lord of heauen keepe
from amonge vs, and graunt you to take
wiser wares. The people doubtles was
fully staied in conscience, and quieted in
the right way of gods word, and wolde
haue continued in the same, if you and

And euerye man maye se, that some for

feare of punishment and losse, are redy

sutch as al this time haue dissembled, &amp;
now openly declare their cankred stomackes,
as redye to tourne with euerye
winde: as any weathercock. No marueil
of their incōstantie in religion, for their
groūd is not the sure foūdation of gods
word, but the slipperie sand of pleasing
mē. Ye shal do doutles a goodlie act to

serue sutche mens affections, and to rebell
against gods truth. Dout not but at
last ye shal haue some cardinals hat for
your laboure.iii. Regu. xvi. xvii. xviii. xxi. iiii. Re. ix and. x. Achab with his baall and

none aduātage that wai, for your owne
consience accuseth you. that ye are not
able to stande, either with Scriptures or

therof to you in disputyng: as is alredy

not made againste you, well then, marke
what the Prophet answerd Amasias at
his departing, and know certainly it wil
come to passe. The hande of the Lorde
is not shortned. Thongh our iniquities
at this present haue iustly prouoked his
anger ouer vs, he will at laste pitie vs for
his sonne Christe our lordes sake. And
we nothīg doubt, but as he his al mightie
&amp; can deliuer: so he his al ful of goodnes
and wil saue all that trust in his mercie
and call vpon him day and night.Luk. xviii
And thankes to God the people hathe
other eyes, then they haue had in times

past. The holy woord of god hathe not
been all so baren, as you woulde it had
been. Men haue some knowledge beetwene
a latine satisfactori popishmasse
and Christes Communiō truly ministred
according to the ghospel. Though you
bost chastitie of pristes, men know a difference
betwene a single lyfe, &amp; a chast
life. It is not .Vii. yeares since some of
your vnmaried pristes, yea as it said one
of your great doctors, wer complained
on for their hote chastitie that bournt a
woman. Men remember yet since some
pristes were indicted for getting wemen
with childe, and murdering the childrē
when thei were borne. Oh horrible chastitie
to be suffered amonge Christians▪
God doubtles will viset these thinges
in due time, as he visited the sinnes of
the wicked before time.actes. xii.

                  i. Mac. ix Marke how He
rod was eaten with wormes Nero slew
himselfe. Iulianus confessed Christ in
death against his wyl. Antiochus stanke
aboue the earth. But to come nerer our
daies. More ād Fisher with frier Forest
&amp; other, desperatly died in the contēpt
of the gospel. Dudleia disceitful tirant
deceiued with hope of pardō, blasphemed
the gospel at the hour of death, of
whom ye make a piller to staie vp youre
Church.Mar. iii. Beware of the sīne against the
holy gost, which shal not be forgeuen in

this worlde, not in the worlde to come.
Those that dispise Moses, die without
redemption, vnder two or .iii. witnesses:
but howe sorer punnishment remainethHebr c. x.
for thē, that tread vnder fote the bloud
of the newe testament, and rayle vppon
the spirit of grace. Once again we beseche
you, for Iesus Christes sake, and for
the hope of the life to come, ād for the
iudgement that we all must come afore:
remember these thinges, and think that
he that wrote this for your admonishion
loketh for no preferment at your hād
but writeth it, if perchaūce ye be not altogether
a damnable desperate, ye may
conuert to God, reuerēce his holi word
geue place to his truthe, &amp; be saued frō
the wrath of god that is to come. God
graūt vs al mercie and grace to turne to
him, that we may be able to stād before
the lord at his cōming, when he shall arise
to iudge the earth. Reade the secōd
Psalme, and se what shall happē to the
rebels against the Lorde and Christe his
sonne. Therfore feare the lorde, do homage
vnto his son, serue him with trē
               bling
&amp; feat, receiu his doctrine, least he
be angry with you, &amp; so you perishe frō
the right wai, for when his wrath shall
be kindled like fire (which shal be shortelie)
blessed shal al those be that
trust in him.
            Amen.
