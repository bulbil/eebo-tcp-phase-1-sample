            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

Short Diſcourſe of

               AS in former yeeres at
this ſeaſon I haue been
alwaies careful to ſhew
my ſpecial affection towards 
                  〈…〉
               
by offering ſom preſent,
appertaining to the preſeruatiō
of your health:
ſo at this time, 
                  〈…〉
                in token of a
good and proſperous newe yeere, (God grant you
many) I haue emboldened my ſelfe to exhibite to

                  〈…〉
                in our vulgar toong, this ſhort
diſcourſe of the three kindes of Peppers, and of
three medicines cōpounded of the ſame, greatly
commended by Galen in his books De ſanitate
tuenda; which being vſed in right order, with
diſcretion, will vndoubtedly bring three waies
commoditie to the continuance of your heath.
For it is certaine that moſt men in this our countrey
through our maner of feeding, do gather in

the ſtomacke and in the first veines many crude
and vndigested humours, which do often occaſion
lacke of appetite, groſſe windines, diſtentions
in the ſides, and many waies greeuous paines; and
ſometimes vnnaturall vomits: which crudities
carried farther into the body, doo breede obſtructions,
tympanies, feuers, and other dangerous
diſeaſes. The due conſideration hereof, may
eaſily inferre how neceſſary to health in this our
region the vſe of pepper is, and what commodity
may accrew by conuenient vſe of the three medicines
made thereof. For first the medicine termed
diatrion pipereon, by conſent of all writers,
hath facultie to warme the ſtomacke, to dry
ſuperfluous moisture, to further concoction, to
diſcuſſe winde, to ripen crude humours, and is
cōmended aboue all other medicaments, that in
performing of theſe actions it doth no way ouerheate
the liuer, nor distemper the bloud. The
ſecond medicine termed diaſpoliticon, keepeth
the belly looſe, and doth carry by the ſtoole, crude,
corrupt, and naughtie humours, cut groſſe and
thicke phlegme, keepeth cleane the belly and
guts. The third medicine termed diacalaminthe,
hauing more ſubtiltie in ſubstance doth penetrate
farther, and ſo doth concoct and expell
not onely the crudities of the belly and of the first
veines, but alſo doth digest, extenuate, diſcuſſe,
and by vrine carieth the excrementes of the inner

veines, clenſeth the bloud, and keepeth clean
the habite of the body by ſweate and perſpiration
through the skin. That in very truth Galen had
iust cauſe ſo greatly to commende theſe three
medicines as moſt conuenient to preſerue health.
For I do not reade in all our authors of a more
conuenient meanes to continue health, than the
apte and due vſe of theſe three medicines, which
in propulſing of diſeaſes, and in reforming of the
ſtate of the body, may be reſembled to the triumuiri
in the common-wealth of Rome. Wherefore
I remaine to the almightie a daily orator
ſo to proſper the effects of theſe medicines,
that the ſame commodities may come vnto your

                  〈…〉
                which our authors do attribute
vnto them, that your yeeres
may be inlarged to extreame
age.

            Of the Spice called
            
               Pepper.
               
                  THAT kind of ſpice
which of the Greeke
authors is called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
the Latin writers
do name Piper, and
the apothecaries do
terme the ſame as
the Latiniſts. After
the Arabike ſpeech in Auicen it is read
Fulful, in Serapio Fulfel. Garcia a phyſician
to the viceroy of India, doth write, that
the Arabians in theſe daies do call it Fulfil:
and he addeth, that the greateſt quantitie
of this ſpice is nowe brought into
Europe, out of the prouince of Malauar:
and that the ſame is in that countrie language
named Molonga. We in Engliſh do
call it pepper: and much vſe of this ſpice
with vs is, in making broths, and in conditing
meates.
            
            
               The kinds of Pepper.
               HEer it is to be noted, that many herbs
of our writers are termed by the
name of pepper. For the herbe called in

Latin Perſicaria, in Engliſh Culrage, is of
ſome named water pepper. The ſeede alſo
of the herbe called Chamelea, is knowen
to the herbarians by the name of hil pepper.
Likewiſe the herbe which we call
Stonecrop, is alſo named mouſe pepper.
And ſom do cal diptander, herbe pepper,
and ſome ſauery pepperwort. So the latter
writers ſhew many other herbs vnder
the name of pepper, and vnder pepperwort.
For they refer to pepper euery kind
of herbe which doth bite the toong as
pepper doth. And beſide the three kindes
of pepper, which are beſt knowen by that
name, we do read in the latter writers of
ſome other kinds vnder that name: and
ſo we read of pepper out of Aethiopia,
which is of the learned rather referred to
that ſpice which is called Carpeſium, than
to any kind of pepper. But properly and
in true ſpeech, this word in Latin Piper,
and in Engliſh pepper; is to be vnderſtood
of one of the three peppers in common
vſe, of which one is named white pepper,
the other blacke pepper, the third long
pepper. Of the which three kinds, and not
of the other things falſly named peppers,
that confection ſo greatly commended in
cold affections of the ſtomack, called Diatrion

pipereon, is made, and kept in our Apothecaries
ſhops. So that theſe three
kindes of peppers moſt properly do deſerue
the name of pepper, and are ſo moſt
conueniently called: and the other things
are rather by ſimilitude ſo termed, for
yeelding ſome taſte like pepper, and therfore
neuer knowen by the name of pepper
without ſome addition, as Piper montanum,
Piper murinum, &amp;c. So that when we
do read in any author this word Piper, or
in Engliſh pepper without addition, we
muſt vnderſtand the ſame of one of theſe
three peppers.
               The nauigations in theſe latter yeeres
made by the Portingales into the eaſt Indians,
and by the Spaniards into the weſt
Indians, hath made manifeſt to vs, how
greatly the old authors, I meane Dioſcorides,
Galen, Plinie, Auicenna, Serapio,
and other writers of the former time were
deceiued in and about the hiſtorie of pepper.
For firſt, all the ancient writers in
their monuments haue deliuered to vs,
that the three kindes of pepper in common
vſe are all three the fruit of one tree.
For (ſay they) the pepper tree doth bear a
long fruit, like vnto that which doth hang
in haſell nut trees, and birch trees. And

they affirme, that this long fruit is the firſt
rudiment of the pepper, which is called
long pepper: after that this fruit being
more ripe is diſcloſed, they take the ſeeds
contained in it to be the white pepper, &amp;
the blacke pepper: ſuch graines which are
not perfectly ripe, they ſuppoſed to be
white pepper, and thoſe which are perfectly
ripe, to be blacke pepper. So they concluded,
that theſe three kinds were all the
fruit of one tree, and differed only in that
one was not ſo ripe as the other. But by
the nauigations of the Portingals, and of
the Spaniards into thoſe countries, in
which theſe pepper trees do growe, it is euident
and well knowen, that the trees
which do yeeld theſe three ſpices are diuers
in kind. For the trauellers into thoſe
countries which haue ſeene the trees, and
gathered the fruits, do witnes, that not
one and the ſame tree, but diuers and different
do beare theſe ſpices. And that the
plants which do beare white pepper and
blacke pepper are not trees of any bignes,
but weake ſhrubs, which do clime vp
by other trees, as an Iuie doth in this our
countrie. And haue leaues like to the apple
tree called Malum Aſſyrium, and do
carrie their fruit in cluſters, like the cluſters

of grapes of vine trees, which are alway
greene vntill they wax ripe. And Garcia,
who liued in theſe parts, writeth, that
the plant which yeeldeth the white pepper,
doth in kind differ from that which
beareth the blacke pepper, and yet are ſo
like, that no man can know the one from
the other, but they which do dwell there.
For (ſaith he) they do ſo differ, as the vine
tree which beareth the white grape, doth
differ from that which yeeldeth the red
grape: and as we cannot know the difference
of theſe vine trees, but when the
grape is ripe, ſo we cannot diſcerne the
plant which yeeldeth the white pepper,
from that which beareth the blacke pepper:
and yet (ſaith he) it is certaine, that
the ſame tree, which bringeth foorth the
blacke pepper, doth not yeeld the white
pepper. He ſaith alſo, that the white pepper
tree is not ſo common in theſe countries
as the other is, and that the ſame is
not to be ſeene, but in certaine places of
Malauar and Malachae. The ſame Garcia
writeth, that the tree, of which long pepper
is gathered, doth greatly differ from
the other forenamed pepper trees: and
that long pepper is a fruit depending of
the tree in like ſort, as we ſee things to

hang downe in our haſell nut trees, and in
our birch trees: and that this fruit wil neuer
yeeld either white or blacke pepper.
By this diſcourſe we do vnderſtand, that
the pepper tree is not like to the Iuniper
tree, as Plinie writeth in his 12. boke. And
Garcia alſo ſaith, that the roote of the
pepper tree is very little. So that it is not
like to ginger, as ſome beleeued in Dioſcorides
time, nor like to the roote of Coſtus
as Dioſcorides writeth. And heerby
alſo we are to vnderſtand that the old ſaying
is fabulous and vntrue, that pepper is
made blacke with fire. For the marchants
which brought the peppers, ſaid, that ſerpents
and venemous beaſts did vſe much
to be vnder theſe pepper trees, and that
they were driuen to fray away thoſe ſerpents
with making fires vnder the trees,
before they durſt gather the peppers, and
ſo the pepper was made black by the fire.
But now we learne by the hiſtories penned
by the latter writers, that all this is
vntrue, and that blacke pepper is of that
colour by his owne kinde, when it is ripe:
and ſo that white pepper is of his owne
kind, euen of that colour when it is ripe.
As the red grape hath that colour naturally
when it is ripe, and the white

grape keepeth his colour euen to his full
ripenes. Wherefore thoſe writers were
much deceiued, which affirmed, that
white and black pepper were of one tree:
and that white pepper was the fruit not
throughly ripe, and that blacke pepper
was the ſame perfectly ripe. For (ſay they)
as in our country, when we gather apples,
all of the ſame tree are not of like ripenes,
ſome not full ripe, ſome full ripe, ſome ouer
ripe, and all are gathered at one time:
ſo, ſay theſe men, when the marchants do
gather pepper, ſome graines are throughly
ripe, and they black and wrinkled, ſome
not full ripe, and they whiter in colour,
and ſmoothe not wrinkled. But it appeereth
by that which they haue deliuered to
vs, which haue ſeene and gathered both
theſe kinds of peppers, that they are gathered
of ſeuerall trees, and that ech doth
perfectly ripe in his kind, and ech retaine
his colour: the white graine when it is
ripe keepeth the white colour, and the
blacke pepper when it is ripe keepeth his
blacke colour: Euen as the white grape
being ripe remaineth white, and the red
grape red, and yet ech do come of ſeuerall
vine trees different in kinde. So we are to
thinke of theſe kinds of pepper, that ech

doth come of his proper tree, and each ful
ripe retaineth his naturall colour: the
white pepper his, and the blacke his colour,
as doth euidently appeere by that
which Garcia hath written in his firſt
booke De aromat. Indiae.
               
               That the Greeke &amp; ancient writers did
erre in expreſſing the hiſtory of theſe peppers,
it is no maruel: for in that their coū
                  tries
were far diſtant from the prouinces
frō whence theſe peppers came, that they
themſelues could not ſearch out a truth,
but followed the report of marchants,
which tell many vntruthes, they were eaſily
deceiued, and ſo did ſet down in their
bookes for verities many vntrue relations
of the marchants.
               But that the Arabians did commit the
ſame errors, whoſe countrie was not far
diſtant from the places where pepper
doth grow, their groſſe negligence in ſearching
the true knowledge of ſimples, can
not be excuſed, who would rather followe
heerein that which was written by the
Grecians, than themſelues ſearch out a
truth.
               Matthiolus in his commentaries vpon
Dioſcorides witneſſeth, that many pepper
trees are ſet to be ſeene at Naples, and

at Venice, and diuers affirme, that theſe
trees are planted in diuers places in Spain
and in Portingall. But I could neuer vnderſtand
that any pepper tree was at any
time brought into England. I haue often
ſeene at Poole in Dorſetſhire, and alſo in
London, the whole cluſters of pepper preſerued
in brine and in ſalt: theſe cluſters
are long and thin, not ſo thicke togither
as the cluſters of grapes.
               Long pepper is to be ſeene in euery
ſhop: for the whole fruit is brought by
the marchants gathered togither like
ſcales, rough &amp; vneuen, biting the toung
like the other peppers.
               We do read of another kind of pepper
brought out of the Indians, which the
Portingals called Piemento de Rabo, in Latin
Piper caudatum, and may be engliſhed
taile pepper. Cluſius in his annotations in
Garcia, ſeemeth to haue known this kind
of pepper, and ſaith that it is like to the
cubebs, and that it hangeth in cluſters, is
very ſpicie, and hath a little ſtalke or ſtem.
This kind is not now brought: for the
king of Portingall did forbid any to bring
it, fearing leaſt it might decay the price
and ſale of the other kindes.
               Monardis alſo in his booke De plantis

Indiae, maketh mention of another kind of
long pepper, different from the common
long pepper, and is much hotter than the
common long pepper, and more pleaſant
to the taſte than black pepper. Where
the latter writers in the hiſtorie of pepper
do diuide long pepper into the garden
and wild, this kind written of by Monardis
is ſuppoſed to be the wilde long pepper,
and the common long pepper, the
garden or domeſticall.
               The latter writers in the hiſtorie of
pepper, do write of another kind of pepper,
which they call Piper corniculatum,
ſome call it Siliquastrum, which may bee
engliſhed, Codded pepper, bicauſe it beareth
his graines in a cod or huske: and
they deſcribe this kinde to haue leaues
like to the herbe called Nightſhade, a
ſquare ſtalk of colour greene, ful of ioints,
white flowers, and after them commeth
the cod, at the firſt greeniſh, and after red,
with a perfect ſmoothnes and ſlikenes:
within that cod are flat graines, whitiſh,
yellow, more biting in taſte than pepper.
Theſe cods are not alway of one forme:
for in ſome of the plants they are greater
and longer, in ſome leſſer and ſhorter: and
the leſſer kind they call pepper of Braſilia:

the greater they call pepper of Calecut,
named after the countries from whence
they are brought. The herbarians of our
time do witnes, that this plant is ſet in diuers
places in Italie, Spaine and Portingal:
for that it is a goodly plant and faire to
the eie, and the graines are vſed for pepper
all the yere, and are thought to commend
meates condited with them, better than
common pepper. I did neuer ſee the
plant, but the cods are common in the Apothecaries
ſhops. It is ſuppoſed of many,
that the olde Greeke authors haue not
written any thing of this plant, but Actuarius
ſeemeth to ſpeake of this kinde of
pepper, vnder the name of Capſicum. Amatus
in his commentaries vpō Dioſcorides
affirmeth, that this kinde of pepper is that
which Auicen in 2. tract. lib. 2. cap. 746.
called Zinziber caninum. Thus much of the
true hiſtorie of pepper, as well out of the
old as latter writers.
            
            
               How to chooſe pepper.
               DIoſcorides writing of three kinds of
pepper, doth giue ſignes and notes
to chooſe onely blacke pepper: for that
as it ſeemeth in his time deceit was onely

vſed in that kind of pepper. For Dioſcorides
writeth, that amongſt blacke pepper
are found certaine ſeedes or graines light,
and emptie, which he calleth Breſma, and
Plinie ſaith they are termed Brechmaſis,
which word doth ſound, ſeeds vttered before
their time. For (ſaith he) by vnſeaſonable
time the graines ſometimes do wither,
and ſo are emptie, hauing in them
no ſubſtance. But Garcia ſaith, that while
he did dwel among the Indians, he inquired,
&amp; could not learne of any ſuch name,
yet acknowledgeth, that ſuch graines like
to pepper are often found amongſt pepper,
and are not eaſily knowen from pepper,
but that they are light, and broken
do yeeld no ſubſtance as pepper doth.
Wherfore as in Dioſcorides time, ſo rather
in this our age, we ought to be diligent
in the choiſe of pepper, and to haue
ſome notes or ſignes to chooſe the good
from the bad, and to know the beſt pepper.
Dioſcorides commendeth pepper
when the graines are heauie, full, whole,
not much wrinkled, new, not full of duſt.
And Galen in 4. De ſanit. tuend. adddeth,
which hath not a very thinne, nor yet a
groſſe and thicke skin.
               Serapio praiſed white pepper, which

hath a white colour, and the latter writers
ſay, the whiter the better, which is ſmooth
and not wrinkled. Galen in 4. De ſanit. tuend.
ſaith, that thoſe grains are beſt, which
are fulleſt and greateſt.
               Serapio alloweth of long pepper, which
when it is broken, doth ſhew his ſubſtance
compacted, and his graines thicke ioined
togither, which do bite the toong with
ſenſible heate. Galen in the ſaid booke De
ſanit. tuend. addeth, that long pepper muſt
be whole, and not haue any holes in it,
and not ſophiſticated. For (ſaith he) the
marchants do bring two ſorts counterfeited,
the one is the bud of an herbe, the
other is made in Alexandria by art. And
in his booke De theriaca ad Piſonem, he telleth
the maner of making of this counterfet
long pepper. They forme it (ſaith
he) of the length &amp; bignes of this pepper,
and then caſt to it the powder of the root
of Pyrethrum, or of muſtard ſeed, &amp; ſo deceiue
the taſte. But theſe deceits are eaſily
bewraied: for by taſte you may diſcern the
right pepper from the buds of that herb,
which are in form like to long pepper, but
not in taſte: and ſo by taſting, you ſhal diſcern
the one frō the other. For whoſoeuer
wil with diligence obſerue the taſt of pepper,

he ſhall eaſily iudge that pleaſant ſpicines
which it yeeldeth with the biting.
And Galen ſheweth how to diſcerne the
counterfeited frō the right, by putting it
into water. For the counterfeited will diſſolue
in water, and ſo the right and naturall
will not diſſolue. Wherefore he concludeth,
that if it hath the true taſte of
pepper, and doth not diſſolue in water,
nor hath holes in it, then that is good
pepper. All writers do make this for a
ſigne of good long pepper, when it hath
no holes: for in deed this pepper is moiſter
than any other kinde, and therefore
will ſooner mould and waxe muſtie than
the other, and ſo will quickly be woorme
eaten, and full of holes.
            
            
               Of the temperament of Pepper.
               DIoſcorides and Galen do yeeld to all
the kinds of pepper a faculty to heat
and to drie, but neither of them do declare
in what degree they do heate and
drie. After that Auerrhois in lib. Simplie.
had pronounced long pepper to be moiſter
than the other: And that white pepper
was not come to his ripenes, and that
black pepper was full ripe: He concludeth

both kinds to be hot in the third degree,
and as ſome ſay in the fourth degree. Auicen
in lib. 2. tract. 2. intreating of white
and blacke pepper generally, affirmeth
pepper to be hot and drie tending toward
the fourth degree. And in the very next
chapter handling of long pepper, he writeth
that it is hot in the third degree, and
drie in the ſecond. Dioſcorides doth not
appoint the degrees of heat and drines to
euery kind of pepper, yet handleth each
very diſtinctly, ſaying, that long pepper
doth more ſtrongly bite: and bicauſe it is
taken from the tree before it is ripe, therfore
it remaineth a little bitter. Blacke
pepper, bicauſe it is perfectly ripe, therefore
it is well ſauored, ſharper than white
pepper, &amp; ſo more pleaſing to the mouth,
and more profitable to condite meates.
The white pepper remaining a little bitter,
is not ſo ſtrong as the blacke. By this
Dioſcorides concludeth, that blacke pepper
is the hotteſt, and beſt of all; next to
it is long pepper, and that the weakeſt is
the white pepper. Galen doth ſeeme heerin
to diſſent from Dioſcorides. For Galen
in 8. ſimpl. med. facult. doth put long pepper
to be moiſter than the reſt, bicauſe it is
the yoong fruit, and therefore doth ſoone

waxe woorme eaten. And after affirmeth,
that white pepper is more ſharpe and biting
than the blacke, and giueth this reaſon
of his aſſertion: for that blacke pepper
is euer heated and dried with the ſun
by long tarrieng vpon the tree: for heerby
many of his hot and fierie parts do breath
out, the rather bicauſe pepper is of a thin
ſubſtance, that his hot parts will quickly
conſume and breath out: and ſo he concludeth,
that bicauſe white pepper is not
ſo heated and dried by the ſun, but doth
retaine and keepe al his hote parts, therefore
it is the hotter, more biting, and the
beſt pepper, contrarie to Dioſcorides aſſertion.
Braſſauolus Muſa going about to
reconcile this controuerſie in Galen, by
diſtinguiſhing of the Greeke word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
For in that white pepper hath plentie
of moiſture in it, therefore it biteth ſtronger,
and leaueth the ſharpe and biting
qualitie to continue longer: and in that
reſpect it may be ſaid to be hotter than
the blacke pepper, hauing little moiſture,
and that much extenuated by the heate
of the ſunne, doth bite quicklier, deeper,
and ſharper: but bicauſe the heate of his
biting doth not ſo long continue, therefore
it ſeemeth not ſo hot as the blacke,

and yet for that it biteth deeper, therfore
Dioſcorides writeth, that it is hotter and
ſtronger than the blacke. And if to trie
the truth heereof, a man will taſte both
kinds of pepper, ſurely he ſhall manifeſtly
perceiue the difference of them both. And
ſo in the one ſenſe white pepper may be
ſaid to be hotter and more biting, as Galen
writeth: and in the other ſenſe blacke
pepper may be thought to exceede the
white as Dioſcorides affirmeth. But where
Dioſcorides ſaith, that white pepper is
weaker than long pepper and black pepper,
bicauſe it not being ful ripe is acerbious
or more tart: ſurely his argument is
not perfect. For as he putteth white pepper
not ſo ripe as blacke, ſo he maketh
long pepper not ſo ripe as white pepper.
And ſo it muſt follow after his opinion,
that long pepper ſhould be weaker than
white, and white than blacke pepper. So
Hippocrates is deceiued in his owne reaſoning.
But in that it is now certaine, that
theſe kinds do not differ, that the one is
riper than the other, but each is ripe and
perfect in his kinde: theſe arguments of
more or leſſe ripenes, do take no place,
and are of no efficacie: bicauſe that by
taſte it is euident, that white pepper doth

bite the toong more, and the biting doth
continue longer: therefore we may iuſtly
ſay that white pepper is the hotter. And
for that Galen lib. 9. De compoſit. ſec. loc. in
the medicine of Philo affirmeth, that
white pepper is better for the ſtomacke
than blacke pepper. And in 4. De ſanit. tuend.
he ſaith, that white pepper doth ſtrēgthen
the ſtomack aboue the other kinds.
Surely the Friers writing vpon Meſue do
truly counſell Apothecaries when pepper
ſimply is read, to take white pepper.
               Notwithſtanding in ſome affects long
pepper is to be preferred before the other
kinds, as Galen witneſſeth lib. 4. De ſanit.
tuend. where he counſelleth to giue long
pepper to them which haue their ſides
blowen vp with wind, and which do turne
all they eate to wind. For (ſaith he) long
pepper doth diſſolue the groſnes of wind,
&amp; caſteth downe by the belly ſuch matter
which doth ſtay in the ſides.
               By this diſcourſe it appeereth, that the
Arabians did truly ſet white and blacke
pepper in the vttermoſt point of the third
degree of heate and drines, or in the beginning
of the fourth degree. And Galen
confirmeth the ſame when he doth write,
that white and blacke pepper do ſtrongly

heate and drie.
               And with good reaſons the ſame Arabikes
do ſet long pepper in the third degree
of heate, and not beyond the ſecond
degree of drying. For in that by all writers
conſent this kind is moiſter than the
other, therefore it cannot drie ſo much as
the other: for the drying qualitie muſt
needs be ſomwhat obtunded by the moiſture
which is in this kind. And therefore
long pepper taſted doth not by and by
bite ſtrongly, but after it is a little chewed,
and then the biting doth laſt longer.
And we may heerby alſo gather, that long
pepper is not ſo ſubtill of ſubſtance as the
other kinds are.
               Garcia writeth, that Emperikes amongſt
the Arabians &amp; Perſians do hold
opinion, that pepper is cold: which opinion
doth alſo preuaile amongſt the common
ſort in this our countrie. For it is a
common ſaying, that pepper is hot in the
mouth, but cold in operation. But for as
much as we do trie the qualitie of medicines
by taſte, theſe men do ſhew their ignorance,
in calling that cold in operation,
which is hot in the mouth.
            
            
               
               The temperament of Siliquastrum, or
Indian Pepper.
               THe Indian pepper called alſo Siliquaſtrum,
is accounted hot and drie in
the fourth degree, and therefore doth very
effectually breake wind, doth heat and
ſtrengthen the inward parts, and is verie
good for the breaſt.
            
            
               The vertues and faculties of
Pepper.
               DIoſcorides, Plinie, Auicenna, and Serapio
do recite and number manie
vertues and medicinal properties of theſe
kindes of peppers, which I leaue the reader
to peruſe in their books. The cheefeſt
vſe of peppers is in cold affects of the ſtomacke,
and of other parts which do ſerue
for nutrition. For euery kind of pepper
doth greatly helpe concoction, diſcuſſe
wind, and doth occaſion all groſſe and ſlimie
humors to diſcend ſooner. And to
this purpoſe many medicines deuiſed by
phyſicians of theſe kinds of peppers are
kept in Apothecaries ſhops, but amongſt
other Galen in his 4. booke De ſanit. tuend.
                  
doth chiefly cōmend three ſorts. And the
medicine termed Diatrion pipereon, in that
it is confected of the three kindes of pepper,
beareth the bell, and is reputed in the
firſt place. And then he commendeth the
medicine called Diacalaminthe: &amp; thirdly,
that which is vſed vnder the name of Diaſpoliticon:
notwithſtanding each of theſe
medicines is not good to the ſelfeſame affects,
neither are they in like ſort &amp; times
to be vſed. Touching Diatrion pipereon, it is
famous for to help concoction, to diſcuſſe
wind, and to do good againſt cold affects
of the ſtomacke, and yet not to heate the
liuer or the blood, wherin conſiſteth a ſingular
propertie of this medicine. For it is
agreed vpō by all authors, that the heat of
this medicine is extinguiſhed in the belly,
and the firſt veines, &amp; is not carried into
the whole bodie, as the heat of the medicine
called Diacalaminthe is; ſo termed,
for that it receiueth the herbe called Calaminth,
as Gal. writeth in the ſaid booke
De ſanit. tuend. cap. 10. where he affirmeth,
that Diatrion pipereon is to be giuen when
crude and ſlimy humors are in the ſtomack
and firſt veines, yea both before and
after meate. The vſe of Diacalaminthe is,
when we meane to warme further into the

bodie, and haue an intent to cut &amp; make
thin groſſe humors in the veines. For Diacalaminthe
doth thinne groſſe and ſlimie
things, breatheth out by the skin, prouoketh
vrine, and the monethly ſicknes in
women. Therefore neither this medicine,
neither Diaſpoliticon ought to be vſed after
meate, bicauſe they two haſten diſtribution,
and ſo do hinder concoction: whereby
we may conclude, that the medicine Diatrion
pipereon may with moſt ſafetie be vſed
after meate to helpe concoction. And to
this intent Galen doth counſell to haue
in a readines this medicine prepared in
two maner of waies: the one ſimple, as
cōſiſting of feweſt things; the other more
compound: the ſimplier is ſooneſt concocted;
the other by reaſon of the number
of ſimples is harder to be digeſted. And
therefore the ſimplier is beſt for them
which do not well concoct their meate,
and do finde ſome cold temperament in
the ſtomacke and bellie, and ſo do gather
much ſlimie flegme: and the other by
reaſon of many ſimples in it, is harder to
be altered of nature, and ſo doth remaine
longer in the ſtomacke when it is taken.
So Galen doth beſt cōmend the frequent
vſe of Diatrion pipereō
                   to remoue crudities

in the ſtomacke and firſt veines. The other
which is more compound, hath his beſt
vſe in fluxes from the head to the breaſt.
In theſe our daies the medicine Diatrion
pipereon is in vſe, made in both waies. In
compounding the ſimplier, our Apothecaries
do follow Nicolaus Myrepſicus, &amp;
ſo do make the medicine in maner as followeth:
Taking of each of the three peppers
one ounce, of

                     ginger,
                     thyme,
                     aniſe ſeedes,
                     perſley ſeedes

                           of each halfe an
ounce.
                        
                     
                  
               
               This deſcription commeth nigh to the
Diatrion pipereon of Galen. For there is no
difference, but that Galen taketh of each
kind of pepper fiftie drachmes, of ginger,
thyme, aniſe ſeedes eight drachmes. Galen
hath in his receit no perſley at all: yet
Galen admoniſheth, that to 50. drachmes
of each pepper, 16. drachmes of the other
things may be added. And Galen willeth
this medicine to be made with honie of
Athens: in this our time it is compounded
with ſugar. The other Diatrion pipereon
more compound and medicinall is at this
time made according to the deſcription
of Meſue, in maner as followeth.
               
                  
Take of the three kinds of

                     pepper
                     ginger,

ſaccharum albiſſimum q. ſ.
               This is the ſame laborious confection
ſet downe by Meſue, of which Galen maketh
mention, lib. 4. cap. 11. De ſanit. tuend.
For Galen in that place doth recite by
name euery ſimple: ſaue that Galen in
ſtead of Amomum, mentioneth the ſeeds
of ammios. And where our authors do
differ in opinion, what is the right Amomum,
and all writers do agree, that we
haue the right ammi: I adiudge it better
in theſe daies to put in this receit the
ſeeds of ammi, according as Galen preſcribeth,
than amomum, as Meſue counſelleth.
So you haue both medicines in
vſe in our time made of three peppers, and

are to be ſold in the Apothecaries ſhops,
vnder the name of Diatrion pipereon.
               
            
            
               Diaſpoliticon.
               THE medicine called Diaſpoliticon is
moſt commended to looſe the belly:
this medicine is compoſed of cummine
ſeedes, pepper, rue, and that kinde of ſalt
called Salnitre. And Galen aduiſeth to
haue this medicine alſo prepared in two
ſorts. Firſt to make it of the foreſaid ſimples
mixed in equall parts, and ſo by reaſon
of that ſalt, it wil looſe the belly more:
the ſecond way to put to equall parts of
the other things, but onely halfe the proportion
of that kinde of ſalt. So will the
medicine remaine longer in the ſtomack,
and better further concoction, more digeſt
crude and rawe humors, and wil leſſe
make the bellie laxatiue.
            
            
               Diacalaminthe.
               GAlen in his fourth booke De ſanitate
tuend. ca. 14. doth ſet downe the compoſition
of the medicine called Diacalaminthe,
in maner following.
               
                  
Take of calaminth,

                     of organy, or organmint,
called Pulegiū,

                     of pepper, ℥.48.
                  
               
               And Galen doth name the countries
from which he counſelleth to procure the
ſimples, but in that they are not in theſe
daies brought from thoſe places, therefore
it ſhall ſuffice to make choiſe of the
beſt ſimples of this our countrie in confecting
of this medicine: for this our
countrie yeeldeth verie good of euerie
ſort.
               In diſpenſing of this medicine, our Apothecaries
do not follow this deſcription
of Galen, but their Apothecary booke
confected by Nicolaus: which compoſition
doth differ from that of Galen in the
doſes of the ſimples, and that this of Nicolaus
hath ſome mo ſimples than that of

Galen. The receite after Nicolaus is as
followeth.
               Take of calamints

                     organie,
                     ſeſelios

               In this compoſition, perſley ſeeds, ammy,
anniſe ſeedes, ginger, are mo then are ſet
in the deſcription of Galen. Some learned
men of our time do commend this receit
of Nicolaus before that of Galen, bicauſe
it hath mo ſimples: but for my part, I
do rather allow of that receit of Galen,
which for the paucitie of ſimples, is with
leſſe labor concocted of them, which do
take it, and to the intent of the medicine,
it receiueth a ſufficient number of ſimples,
ſo that they which are inſerted by
Nicolaus, ſeeme ſuperfluous.
               Galen appointeth a proportion of the
beſt and choſen honie, therewith to compounde

this and the other medicines,
which he willeth to be ſcummed with
great diligence: and if the quantity of hony
be increaſed, the medicine ſaith he will
be more pleaſing. And he here ſetteth a
rule which the apothecaries are to follow
in compounding of medicines, to make
them ſo pleaſant to the taſte as they can,
without weakning of their ſtrength, or diminiſhing
of their vertues. In theſe daies
the moſt part of medicines are made vp
with ſugar in ſteade of honie, for ſugar
is more gratefull to the taſte, and many
can not well away with honie. And honie
is ſooner conuerted vnto choler than ſugar.
               Touching the maner of making theſe
medicines, Galen doth admoniſh, that
they are not to be compounded in one
and like ſort, for in ſome reſpects the ſimples
are to be pounded finely, and ſerſed
with a fine ſerſer. For ſaith he when things
are finely beaten, they paſſe quickly into
the whole body, things groſely powdered
do ſtay longer in the belly, for the ſame
cannot ſo eaſily paſſe through the little
veines and ſmall pores of the body. In
which reſpect things groſely powdered
do more looſe the belly: when they are

brought into fine powder, they go ſooner
into the body, and prouoke ſweate, and
better mooue vrine, but do leſſe mooue to
ſtoole. Therefore in compounding of the
medicines called Diacalaminthe Galens
counſell is to bring all the ſimples into
fine powder, that the ſame may the better
paſſe into all parts of the body, for the vſe
of this medicine is, when we haue an intent
to concoct and digeſt the crude and
rawe humours in the inner veines and habite
of the bodie, and ſo to euapore them
by the pores of the skin, when we meane
to prouoke ſweate, vrine, and the courſes
of women, And therefore he will not haue
this medicine often vſed after meate. In
the medicine called Diaſpoliticō, al the ſimples
muſt be pounded in groſſe maner, for
ſo the medicine will more looſe the belly,
and by ſtaieng longer in the ſtomack, further
concoction, if the things be finely
powdered into duſt: as the medicine will
little or not at all make the belly laxatiue,
ſo it will prouoke vrine and ſweate, to the
intention of this medicine.
               The like manner is to be obſerued in
confecting of Diatrion pipereon, that if an
intent be to haue the medicine ſtay in the
ſtomacke and guts to warme thoſe parts,

to digeſt crude humours in them, or to
looſe the belly, the ſimples muſt be pounded
groſſely: but if we haue a purpoſe to
open obſtructions, to warme the inner
veines, to prouoke vrine or ſweate: althings
muſt be beaten into fine powder.
By which diſcourſe that queſtion is eaſily
anſwered, which ſome latter writers do
moue about the beating of the kindes of
pepper, whether the ſame ought to be
beaten finely or groſly. For ſome do affirme
that pepper is alwaies to be beaten
groſly, for ſo it will remaine longer time
in the ſtomacke, and will the leſſe heate
the liuer and the blood. Some other doo
maintaine a contrary opinion, and that
by Galen himſelfe, who in the 5. booke
De ſanit. tuend. cap. 8. After meats which do
bread ſtoppages in the body, take (ſaith
he) the medicine called Diacalaminthe, and
if you haue not it ready, take Diatrion pipereon:
and if that be not at hand, take
white pepper beaten into fine powder, &amp;
diligently ſerſed, &amp; mingle the ſame with
the meate, and ſprinkle it to your drinke.
And in the ſame booke the 10. cap. Galen
preſcribeth a ptiſane in which the duſt or
fine powder of white pepper is mingled.
And in the 6. booke De ſanit. tuend. cap. 14.

Galen giueth pepper alone, as finely powdered
as may be. By theſe counſels of Galen,
theſe men do conclude that pepper
ought alway to be beaten into fine powder
by Galens doctrine. Neuertheleſſe,
theſe men in mine opinion, do not with
diligent care cōſider Galens intention in
theſe and the like places, neither well haue
marked the ſcope and cauſe why Galen in
theſe places doth aduiſe to pound pepper
into fine powder: for if they had well conſidered
that Galen writeth: they might
haue vnderſtood, that he giueth pepper ſo
finely beaten, to remoue the obſtructions
and ſtoppages, for ſo before he did admoniſh,
that things beaten into thin powder
paſſe into the body better, and ſooner
do remoue obſtructions: and contrariwiſe,
that which is groſly beaten, doth
ſtay in the belly longer, and better warme
thoſe parts, better digeſt crude and rawe
humors gathered in them, and do more
effectually diſcuſſe wind: to theſe latter intents
pepper is to be beaten groſly, eſpecially
in this our country, in which men
commonly do ſeed vpon groſſe and ſlimy
meats, and ſo do heape in the parts of the
belly and firſt veines, manie crude and
groſſe humors, that pepper ought in this

region to be beaten moſt groſly, that it
may therby be occaſioned to ſtay the longer
in the belly, ſo to warme the ſame the
better, and the better to concoct and extenuate
ſuch groſſe and crude humors, for
the heat of this medicine (as Galen writeth)
is founded in ſo ſubtil a ſubſtāce, that
the ſame is extinguiſhed before it can
come to the liuer: then if you ſhall beate
the medicine finely, the heate wil ſo ſoone
be exhauſted and ſpent, that it will neither
ſufficiently warme the belly, neither in
good ſort concoct thoſe crude and rawe
humors. Wherefore I do thinke it verie
needfull for our apothecaries to pownd
pepper alway groſly in the medicine Diatrion
pipereon. For if we ſhall need withall to
open obſtructions, we may preſcribe the
medicine called Diacalaminthe, and ſo we
may mingle it to Diatrion pipereon, or as occaſion
ſerueth giue it alone: wherefore I
hold it beſt to follow Galen his precept,
which is, that alway things be powdered
finely and in ſubtill manner when our
purpoſe is to remoue obſtructions, or to
digeſt, cut, and abſterge crude, rawe, ſlimy,
and groſſe humors, which are in the
inner veines and habite of the body, or
meane to prouoke ſweat or vrine; but if

our meaning be to increaſe heate in the
parts of the belly, to concoct humors
there, and in the firſt veines, or to make
the bellie looſe, then things are to be beaten
in groſſe powder.
            
            
               The priuate properties of the medicine
called Diaſpoliticon.
               THis medicine doth make the bellie
looſe, and bringeth out meate, which
corrupteth in the ſtomacke, and is ſpeciall
good for them which haue a cold bellie,
or declining to cold. For it maketh thinne
groſſe phlegme, and expelleth flatulent
winde. See Galen in the fourth booke
De ſanitate tuenda.
               
            
            
               The particular faculties and properties of
Diatrion Pipereon.
               
                  DIatrion pipereon is of great efficacie and
doth much good in all colde diſeaſes
of the ſtomacke, in ſower belkes, in
quartaine feauers, in palſies, in euill affected
liuers, in them which haue their
bellies blowen vp with winde.
               
                  Diatrion pipereon confected after the deſcription
of Meſues, is chiefly commended

in fluxes, from the head to the breaſt,
good generally to the coldnes of the
cheſte, and to coughes, which do proceed
of a colde cauſe.
               That the excellent and rare vertues of
this medicine called Diatrion pipereon,
might the better be known, I thought
good in this place to remember the
reader what is written in the booke
intituled Secretorum, which booke
is aſcribed to Galen, in which booke
we reade in this maner.
               A certaine friend of mine being about
the age of 70. yeeres, complained of
a coldnes in all the parts of the bodie, inſomuch
that his memorie failed him, and
he had paine in his ioints, and then I
made for him this medicine called Diatrion
pipereon, and it was a wonder to ſee how
he recouered in the ſpace of a fortnight.
And I made triall in many which were
ſicke of diſeaſes of the bladder, of the
heade, and of the iointes, occaſioned by
colde and crude humors: and it is found
ſpeciall good in a cough of cold phlegme,
in weakenes of the ſtomacke. For it breaketh
groſſe winde, digeſteth meat, prouoketh

appetite, reſolueth crude humours,
ſtrengtheneth the ſtomacke euerie way,
reſtoreth memory, cleareth the voice, putteth
backe grey heares, remedieth the
goute which commeth of a colde cauſe:
And in generall whoſoeuer aged doth vſe
much this medicine, he ſhall not need any
other helpe to preſerue his health.
            
            
               The priuate properties of the medicine
called Diacalaminthe.
               IT cutteth groſſe and ſlimy humors, and
occaſioneth the ſame to be clenſed by
the skin by ſweate, prouoketh vrine, and
the monthly courſes in women, as Galen
witneſſeth in the 4. booke De ſanit. tuend.
it is good for them which do abhor meat,
for the vſe of it prouoketh appetite, it remedieth
the ſhortnes of breath, and helpeth
them which finde a coldnes in their
ſtomacks, and which haue their ſides and
bellies blowen vp with winde, as Meſue
writeth.
            
            
               The maner and particular vſe of the
foreſaid medicines.
               WHen many crude and rawe humors
do abounde in the bellie

and firſt veines, that in that reſpect it will
not be ſafetie to giue a purgatiue medicine,
then is the cheefeſt vſe of Diaſpoliticon,
for it then giuen will ſafely ſtir nature
to expell thoſe humors by the ſiege. So in
other caſes when ſo euer the belly is drie,
and doth not hir dutie, then it is expedient
to giue Diaſpoliticon.
               
            
            
               The vſe of Diatrion pipereon, and of Diacalaminthe:
out of Galen. 4.
De ſanit. tuend.
               WHen many raw and vndigeſted
humors are gathered in and about
the firſt veines, the ſame are to be cut
and digeſted, and in ſo dooing ſpeciall
care is to be had leſt the ſame be carried
farther into the bodie. In this caſe Diatrion
pipereon ſimple, is with moſt ſecuritie giuen.
And it is not enough to giue it once
or twiſe euery day, but it muſt be taken
often, in the morning before meate, &amp; after
meat, &amp; when they go to bed, a ſpoonfull
at a time, and ſo to yonger folke and
which haue leſſe need, the leſſer quantity:
to elder and to them which haue more
need, the bigger quantity, ſo to the mean,

the meaner quantitie is to be proportioned.
               When crude humors are heaped in the
inner veines, and in the habit of the body,
the ſame are to be concocted, and alſo to
be expelled by breathing the ſame thorough
the pores of the skin, and to theſe
intents there is not a more conuenient
medicine knowen than Diacalaminthe, for
it hath propertie to extenuate thicke, and
ſlimy things, and then mooueth the ſame
to be expelled by breathing out at the
skin, and by vrine. And this medicine is
not vnpleaſant to be taken, if a good proportion
of honie be boiled with it, but
where ſome do not like of ſweet things,
and do abhor honie, to ſuch you muſt put
the leſſe honie, yet oftentimes euen in this
caſe it is good to boile good ſtore of honie,
ſo you boile it well, for then the medicine
will not be ouerſweet, and the honie
well boiled doth leſſe offend the ſtomack.
And the vſe of this medicine is in the morning
after frictiō, before exerciſe, &amp; before
bathing. And you may vſe this medicine
dry in powder without honie in ſteede of
ſalt for ſauce to your meate, and you may
put of it in a Ptiſane in ſteede of pepper.
               This medicine is vſed not onely dry in

ſteede of ſalt, but alſo when honie is mixed,
for euen ſo it may be vſed with meate,
and ſo is it pleaſing to the taſte. But neither
this, neither any other medicine
which hath ſtrong facultie to further diſtribution,
is to be taken after meate. For
at that time nature goeth about concoction
of meate taken, and not to diſtribute
the ſame, therefore immediately after
meate, endeuor muſt be to further concoctiō
by giuing Driatrion pipereon ſimple,
or to put ſome pepper powdered into
your drinke.
               If ſuch crudities hap to be not onely in
the belly and firſt veines, but alſo in all other
veines, yea in the fleſhie parts of the
bodie: in this caſe at the beginning of the
cure, it is beſt to vſe Diatrion pipereon, adding
ſo much of the ſeeds of perſley growing
in a drie &amp; ſtonie ground, as is put of
aniſe ſeedes, thyme, and ginger, and after
the firſt day, or rather after the ſeconde
day, you may put a little of Diacalaminth,
and then in a while after mingle both, I
meane Diatrion pipereon, and Diacalaminth,
in equall parts, and in proceſſe of time increaſe
the Diacalaminthe, ſo at the latter
end of the cure, you may vſe Diacalaminth
alone. So it is to be concluded in this, as

in all maner of diets, when the effects are
equall, the medicines to cure, are equally
to be mixed, yet ſo that at the firſt greateſt
care be had of the crudities in the firſt
veines, and at the latter end, of thoſe crudities,
which are in the other veines and
habit of the bodie, in the middle time
both are equally according to the effect
to be mingled. Thus far Galen in his 4.
