            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            ¶The prologue of the famous Syr Anthonie of Gueuara, Byſhoppe of Mondonnedo, preacher, chronicler, &amp; counſellour to the Emperour Charles the fifth, vpon the life of tenne Emperours of Rome. (⸫) The Author proponeth.
            
               VARIVS GEMINVS, a man verie glorious, and Conſul among the Romains, ſaide vnto Iulius Caeſar: O Caeſar and great Auguſtus, ſuch as dare preſume to ſpeake before thee, knowe not thy greatneſſe: and thoſe that are abaſhed to appeare in thy preſence, comprehend not thy nobleneſſe: wordes in deede right worthie of ſuch a perſon. Conformable to that which Varius Geminus ſaide, wee do ſaye: It appertaineth to the greatneſſe of Princes, that their perſons be much authoriſed, and on the other parte, that they endeuour to communicate with their common wealthes, for that with their mightineſſe they may giue terrour, and with their plaine mildneſſe remoue all feare. Sucronius ſaith of Octauius the emperour, that euer any ambaſſadours came in his preſence, which at the firſt ſight were not touched with feare: and after in communicating did not adore him: becauſe, great was the maieſtie wherewith he did receiue them, and after, verie ſweete were the woordes wherewith he did diſpatch them. Of the great Cato Cenſorine, Plutarche ſaith: that being the man of moſte honeſtie, and greateſt grauitie that liued amongeſt the Romaines: he did neuer ſhewe to any man, a ſadde, but cheerefull countenance, or giue

euill aunſwere, nor ſhut the doore againſt any perſon, either denyed any thing that was iuſt, neither ſhamed or diſgraced any man. Not onely happie, but alſo moſt happie is the Prince, that for rectitude of iuſtice is feared, and for his good condition beloued. Much weakeneſſe of Princes, and great Lordes is couered, and vices diſsimuled, when with their owne they be of good condition, and with ſtraungers of gratefull conuerſation. Of the famous tyrant Dionyſius the Siracuſan, Plutarche ſaith: that the immortal hatred which the Sicylians did beare him, was not ſo much for the tyrannies that he did execute, as for the incomporcable condition which he vſed: for that verie ſeldome he did permitt him ſelfe to be ſeene: and verie oft was heard laughing. The contrarie wherof is read of king Antigonus, the father of the greate Demetrius: whoe was proude, couetous, ambitious, cruell, and effeminate: and with all theſe conditions the people of his kingdomes did both ſuffer and ſerue him: onely for that they founde the dores of his houſe alwayes open, and in his mouth an amorous aunſwere. The ende of all this which we haue ſaide is, humblie to praye all princes, and giue warning vnto all ſuch as be about them, alwayes to perſuade and counſell them to be ſo humaine, that all may endure their conuerſation: and yet ſo graue, that none preſume to make ſmall accompt of them: for that it maketh much to the matter of good gouernement, to be indued with good nature and diſpoſition. No leſſe inconuenience doth followe the common wealth, for the Prince to be holden in ſmall eſtimation, then to be vntractable, ouer haughtie, or ſtraunge: for, if he be inconuerſible, they abhorre him: and if not eſteemed, they diſobey him.
            
               Sardanapalus, the laſt King of the Aſsyrians, was with all men ſo humaine, that women made him ſpinne: and of Phalaris the tyrant, it is read, that he was ſo inconuerſible, that his owne daughters durſt not ſpeake vnto him. To the ende that Princes be not abhorred in their common wealthes, they haue to conſider, and alſo beware to be noted of extremities: which is to witt, in vſing too great familiaritie with ſome, and no leſſe ſtraungeneſſe with others: becauſe muche ſtraungeneſſe ingendreth hatred: and too much familiaritie leadeth to contempt. The rule that in this caſe wee dare giue vnto Princes, mightie and noble men, is: that they be neither ſo affable with their priuate and fauoured ſeruants, whereby to giue them hardineſſe to craue any thing vniuſt: either ſo ſtraunge with them that be not priuate, as to giue them feare to demaund iuſtice. It is not remoued from Princes, to giue their kingdomes vnto their children, to committ their ſecretes vnto ſuch as be ſeruiceable, to vſe their liberalitie with their priuate and fauoured ſeruauntes, to take their paſtimes with their friendes, vpon ſuch condition, that their conuerſation be ſomewhat generall: for aſmuche as the liberalitie of Princes extendeth not to ſatiſfie euery ſuite: they ſupply much more with their amorous aunſwers that they giue, then with the rewardes which they beſtowe. Not vnworthily was it ordeined of the moſte auncient Greekes, that the vſe of Princes ſhoulde not be to pronounce in their letters patents, and commaundementes: I commaund this, I will this, I forbidde this: but that they ſhould ſaye: We commaund this, We will this, and ordeine this: for their better remembrance, that by ſpeaking in the name of all, they ſhould in time be conuerſant with all, be familiar with all, and diuide rewardes amongeſt all, and that they are of all, and not of them ſelues.
            
               He that hath to holde the leaſt parte of the prince, ought to be the prince him ſelfe: for that, great regarde is to be had of all men, as concerning the ſeruice of his perſon: and he ought to be vigilant in all things that are profitable to the common wealth. Howe much the more the Prince regardeth him ſelfe: ſo muche the more he neglecteth him ſelfe. And howe muche the leſſe he careth for him ſelfe: ſo muche the more ſhall he attaine to him ſelfe: for that the harmonie of the common wealth conſiſteth in nothing more, then all men to liue of the liberalitie and bountie of the prince: and that the Prince liue in the loue of all men.
            
            ¶The Authour proſecuteth his intent.
            It is alſo neceſſarie counſell vnto the prince, that he haue a ſound minde and diſpoſition, and his intents verie well aduertiſed: for that if in his affaires he make no accompt to be certeine, he ſhall hardly ceaſe to erre: and if he be not attentiue to the affaires of the common wealth, he ſhall neuer vnderſtand them.
            The prince ought grauely to regarde the thing he doth, before it be done: for the errour of any other whatſoeuer, the offence is onely felt in his own houſe: but the errour of the prince, redoundeth to the whole common wealth. The princes that be wilfull in the thinges which they will: and headſtrong wherein they commaund: beſides that they go laden with thoughts, holding their perſons in perill, eſcandalize their common wealth, accuſed to be ouer amarous of their owne proper iudgement, and moſte great enimies of others counſell. The prince alſo ought very particularly vnderſtand the things of the common wealth, if he wil vſe good gouernement thereof. And this he hath to be aduertiſed, not of ſuche as goe to murmur, but of ſuch as make iuſt report, and alſo giue counſel therein: for that

               twixt the Prince and the common wealth, there ſhall neuer be peace, if to lyars and murmurers he giue audience. Euen as Princes deſire not in their ſubiectes, but to be ſerued: euen ſo their ſubiects deſire not of their princes, but to be beloued, &amp; moſt truely, the one is annexed vnto ye other, and depēdeth each of other: for if in the Prince there be no loue, there is none that wil ſerue him with affection. Princes and great lordes, ought to holde in great eſtimation, that their ſubiectes do obey them: but much more haue the ſubiectes to make accompt, when their lordes do loue them: becauſe, without compariſon, his bountie is much greater that bindeth vs to loue, then the trauaile of him that offereth to ſerue.
As loue is not repayed but with loue, ſo Princes are not to be ſatiſfied with only giuing ſuch as do ſerue and followe them, offices, caſtels, cuſtomes, houſes and money: but alſo they ought to ſhewe them loue in their palaces, and fauour in their affaires: becauſe, with their liberalitie, they recompence their ſeruice paſt: but with their loue they bind them to ſerue in time to come.
            
            Princes and men of power, ought in their countenance to be amorous, in their ſpeach milde, in their behauiours muche ordered: for that generous hartes, and bluſſhing and ſhamefaſt faces, that followe courtes, and go in Princes houſes, do muche more feele the diſfauour whiche they ſhewe them, then the rewardes that they denye them. To the ende that Princes be deliuered of diſpleaſures: and their kingdomes better gouerned: it ſhalbe moste ſound counſell for them to be affable with all, to giue vnto all, to deale for all, &amp; to loue all: but if they determine to holde ſome more priuate, they ought much to conſider whome they admitt to their ſpeciall fauour: becauſe for one to be priuate in Court, it is not ſufficient that the king doe chooſe him: but that alſo he be of merite and deſeruing.
            
            
               In giuing rewardes, princes may not alwayes eſcape errour, but in commending their heartes, they ought to be moſt certaine: for that, In this whole world there is not the like torment, as a man to haue his loue euill imployed. If Princes and great Lordes will particularly take into their fauour any of their ſeruaunts, they ought to be of particular deſeruing: bycauſe, loue ſhall neuer be fixed: when in him that is loued, there wanteth merite. Not without cauſe we ſayde, that it were neceſſarie in a Prince to be indued with a good mynd and diſpoſition, and with ſound meaning and intention: bicauſe if the Prince be taken with imperfect and vnlawfull affection, Alas of him, and alſo of his kingdome, that by him is gouerned, It is euill that the Prince haue no rule in feeding, in play, in drinking, in ſpeaking, and alſo in ſpending: but it is much worſe if he vſe it not in his loue and affection: for it is a rule
infallible: that euerie diſordinate loue, bringeth with it ſome notable vice. It is a loue diſordinate to bee carefull to gather riches, and not to haue a mynde to ſpend them: bicauſe vnto the greatneſſe of Princes it appertaineth, to ſeeke what to ſpend: and not to learne to keepe audit. It is a loue diſordinate, for ye prince to folow the direction of his owne proper will: bicauſe it is impoſsible but he ſhould fayle to perfourme that which hee ought, that alwayes executeth his owne wilfull minde. Loue is diſordinate, when the Prince imployeth his loue in fewe, being Lord of many: bycauſe Princes in ſuch wiſe ought to loue, and be bountifull vnto their priuate and fauoured ſeruaunts, that they diſgrace not the nobles of their kingdome. Loue is diſordinate, when Princes in vanities, and trifles do conſume their times: bycauſe the curious gouernour

in ſuch wiſe diuideth time betwixt him and the common wealth: that he neither wanteth for affaires, or hath too much to imploy in vices. Loue is diſordinate, when the Prince is orgulous, quarellous, ambitious, and proude: for notwithſtanding, that as a Prince they ought all to ſerue him: it followeth not that as a God, they ſhoulde adore him. Loue is diſordinate, to hazarde the giuing and diuiding of rewardes, not as euerie man deſerueth, but according to the wil of him that gouerneth: for there is no equal infamie vnto the prince, as it is to chaſtice vice, &amp; not to remunerate ſeruice. Loue is diſordinate, when of will he taketh away frō another, that of right apperteineth not vnto him ſelf: bicauſe to ye greatnes &amp; ſinceritie of princes, it is iuſt &amp; conuenient, yt in their rewardes &amp; gifts, they ſhew their franke liberalitie: &amp; in receiuing, they ſtande with all men in iuſtice. The caſe ſtandeth thus: yt the Prince which is indued with theſe loues &amp; affections, may not eſcape many trauels, and alſo many ſouden aſſaults and perils: for yt euerie diſordinate affection, ſhe her ſelf, with her ſelf, bringeth griefe and diſpleaſure.
Plutarche in his bookes of cōmon welth, perſuadeth the Emperour Traiane, that hee hath his will at libertie, and his loue ſubiect to no man: for that according as hee ſayeth: It little profiteth that a Prince be Lord of many kingdomes: if on the other part, he become bondman to many vices. The diuine Plato ſaide, that for a prince to be good, hee ought to giue his heart vnto the common wealth, his rewardes vnto ſuch as ſerue him, his deſires vnto the Gods, and his loue vnto his friendes, his ſecretes to his priuie counſell: and the time to affaires. Oh how happy were that prince, that according to this Platonicall

ſentence ſhould diuide and repart his perſon: bicauſe he being diuided for all: the whole ſhould be ioyned together, with, and for him.
            ¶The authour applyeth all that which is ſayd, vnto the end wherfore he did ſpeake the ſame.
            All that which we haue aboue ſayde by writing, (moſt ſouereigne Prince) wee will vtter and declare by example: for according to the ſaying of Eſchines the Philoſopher, Words well ſpoken, do awake and reuiue the iudgements: but great and manifeſt examples perſuade the heart. For to leade or intice a man to be vertuous, and to do vertuous woorkes, it maketh muche to the matter, to perſuade with diſcrete reaſons, &amp; ſweete words: but in concluſiō, for much credite which we giue to yt which he ſayth: much more is giuē to that which he doth. The Poet Homer ſaid:
that it is, a thing verie eaſie to write acts of great proweſſe, and verie difficil to performe them. For whiche cauſe it is neceſſarie, for ſuch as deale with princes, to ſhewe them by example, all which they perſuade thē by writing: to the end they ſee moſt cleare, that the great and mightie deedes done by other Princes in the worldes: they want not force to performe them: but a minde to vndertake them. No Prince hath to holde of him ſelfe ſo ſmall eſtimation, that he doubt to performe that which another Prince hath done in time paſt: for after this manner, Theodoſius ſhould be diſmaide, by the remembraunce of Seuerus: Seuerus, of Marcus Aurelius: Marcus Aurelius, of Antoninus Pius: Antoninus Pius, of Traiane: Traiane, of good Titus: Titus, of Caeſar Auguſtus: Caeſar Auguſtus, of Iulius Caeſar: Iulius Caeſar, of Scipio: Scipio, of Marcus Marcellus: Marcus Marcellus, of Quintus Fabius:

Quintus Fabius, of Alexander Magnus: and Alexander Magnus, of Achilles the Greeke.
The heartes of theſe ſo high Princes, did not reade and inquire of the deeds of their forefathers, to feare them, but to imitate them: &amp; ſurely they had great reaſon: bicauſe None amongſt the mortal hath done any deed ſo glorious, that by another man may not be beautified and made better. Princes be boūd to do ſuch and ſo high deedes and enterpriſes, that of them ſelues be worthy praiſe, and very honourable for others to folow: for the ſame it is not more neceſſarie, to haue a noble minde to giue the enterpriſe: thē after wards to haue the aduenture, to finiſh the ſame. Plutarche ſaieth, that Ageſilaus the Greeke ſaid, that Fortune did neuer ſhew her ſelfe noble, but vnto a minde that was generous and noble: and ſurely he ſaid moſt truth, bicauſe men loſe many things, not bicauſe they may not attaine them, but for that, they dare not attempt them. The Prince ought to ſtraine and enforce him ſelf to be good, and to imitate the vertuous: ſince with leſſe coſt, mē be vertuous thē vitious, milde then ouerthwart, valiant then cowards, patient thē furious, and ſober then gluttons: for the theefe doth need as deſperate a minde to ſcale an houſe, as a noble minde is due to a captein that foloweth the wars. Dionyſius the tyrant, Gorgius the tyrant, Bias the tyrant, Macrino the tyrant, &amp; Catiline the tyrant: if we might commend them, and they of thē ſelues giue reaſon: they would ſweare and affirme that they paſſed more trauell, and found thē ſelues in more perill in defending their tyrannies, then Scipio and Cato in conſeruing their cō
               mon wealthes. Oh, what great reaſon, and how much occaſion haue Princes to be good, and to fauour the good: ſince they haue authoritie to commaunde, and riches to giue: whereof if they haue skyll

to take the aduauntage, with their potencie they frame them ſelues to be ſerued, and with their giftes they bring to paſſe to be loued. Ioyntly with this, I admoniſhe and alſo aduiſe Princes and great lordes, to be magnificent in their giftes, and verie attemptiue in their commaundements. For, notwithſtanding,
a Prince may do what he liſt: it is not conuenient he do what he may. Although the authoritie of the prince be free, abſolute, and without meaſure: to him it is conuenient in all thinges to vſe meaſure and moderation: for that euery gouernement that is abſolute, hath a taſte or reliſhe of tyrannie.
Many Princes haue loſt thē ſelues by their vices which they vſed: and many more haue beene caſt away by executing their will and power: for princes in perfourming all that they can, and all which they will: it followeth, that their affection maketh them ſtumble: &amp; paſsion, their eyes to dazell. But (moſte ſouereigne Prince) ſpeaking more particularly, by the imitation of Plutarche, and Suetonius Tranquillus, I thought good to tranſlate, compile, and to refourme the ſtorie of the liues of tenne Romaine princes, worthie moſte ſurely to be knowen, and verie pleaſant to be read. The purpoſe wherefore (moſte mightie Prince) I haue taken ſo exceeding trauaile to compounde this worke, is: vnto the ende my penne may aduertiſe, wherein my tongue with ſhame diſmaieth to ſpeake: for as Bias the philoſopher ſaide: The authoritie of princes is ſo greate, that of more thinges they haue to giue them to vnderſtand, then to dare or preſume to ſpeake. The king Artaxerxes trauailing on a certeine daye, a man of the countrie preſented him with a little water in the palme of his hand:

the which water, the king receiued and dranke: and when ſome did murmur of that deede, and alſo detract him: the king made aunſwere: It is no leſſe nobleneſſe vnto the Prince to receiue little, then to giue greate and bountifull rewardes. The philoſopher Lycurgus, that was lawe giuer vnto the Lacedaemonians, commaunded thoſe of his common wealthe, that they ſhoulde offer vnto their Gods fewe thinges in number, and not riche of value: whereof, when he was noted and alſo accuſed, made aunſwere: I commaund not to offer vnto the Gods fewe thinges, for that I thinke them not to deſerue muche, but becauſe all men ſhould haue wherewith to offer: ſince of all men they will be ſerued: for in the time of Apollo, they ſaide vnto mee: that they had rather haue little of manie, then much of fewe. In the lawe whiche God gaue vnto the Hebrues, he was ſo limitted in the thinges he demaunded, and ſo humaine in that he commaunded: that in the order of the ſacrifices which they ſhould offer, he did ordeine and cōmaund that the poore man whiche could not offer a goate, ſhould offer no more but of the hayre therof. In conſidering that Lycurgus offered vnto his Gods, iewels of ſmall price: and that king Artaxerxes receiued of a poore man an handfull of water: and that vnto the true and liuing God, they durſt offer no more but of the hayres of a Goate, giueth mee hardineſſe to preſent this work vnto your Maieſtie.

               CHAP. I. Of foure renoumed Cities that periſhed and were ſubuerted in Spaine.
               
                  BEfore they had Emperours in Rome, either warre was raiſed in Carthage, ther were in foure prouinces in Spaine, foure right notable cities, which in potencie did matche with Rome, in riches with Tyrus, in beautie with Helia, &amp; in opulencie with Tarento. The firſte was Numantia: the ſeconde, Cantabria: the thirde, Yſtobriga: the fourth, Italica. Strabo, Iſodore, and Pomponio Mela, giue great admiration vnto the readers, of the great power, richeſſe, and wealth of theſe foure cities. And on the other part, it is great pitie to conſider, that there is nothing of them remayning to beholde. Not without cauſe it is ſaide, that nothing remaineth in them to be ſéene: becauſe notwithſtanding the prouince, boundes, and climate is knowen of the foundation thereof: yet we may hardly attaine to name the verie place where it was bu
                     •
                  lt. Vnto the citie of Numantia, Soria ſuccéeded: vnto ye citie of Cantabria, ſuccéeded Tudela of Nauarre: vnto the citie of Yſtobriga, ſuccéeded Merida: vnto the citie of Italica, ſuccéeded Ciuil. The ſituation of the famous Numantia, as ſome men affirme, was vpon a certeine hill neare vnto Soria on the other ſide of the bridge: and as others doe thinke, her foundation ſtoode in Garray a village of Soria ioyning vnto Duero. The ſituation of Cantabria, was a league from the citie of the Groine,
                  
and on that ſide of Ebro, vpon a certeine height where nowe are planted many vines. The ſeate of Yſtobriga was, where nowe the ventes of Caparra, being bayting places, ſtand: and others ſay, yt was on the hill that ſtandeth betwixt the two riuers Las varcas de Alconeta, yel caſare de carceres. The ſituation of Italica was ioyning vnto the citie of Ciuil: and ſome ſaye it was vpon the way to Carmona: and that the arches of Carmona were made to furniſhe the citie of Italica. O ſecrete iudgementes of the moſte high, or humaine inſtabilitie, that all theſe places being viewed perſonally of my ſelfe, where theſe ſo excellent cities were buylt, I found not ſo muche as a tower, a wall, a ſtréete, or a houſe to beholde: neither ſo much as a ſtone almoſt to ſtumble at. We haue great reaſon to exclaime, and much more hath the diſcréete reader to wonder: ſince we vnderſtand that fourtéene yeres Numantia reſiſted the power of the Romaines: and now we ſée it made a paſture for ſhéepe. We vnderſtande that Cantabria was the laſt thing whiche the Romaines did ſubdue in Spaine: and nowe there remaineth but a patche of vineyardes in the ſame. We certeinly knowe that the greateſt ſtrength which king Viriato held in Spaine, was Yſtobriga: and nowe there remaineth not but certeine gr
                     •
                  ene trées &amp; ſhrubbes. They which write of the citie of Italica, do ſaye: that it was the moſt ſtrong and the moſt eſtéemed of all the kingdome of Vandalia: and nowe they gather both wheat and barley in the ſame. Scipio the Africane deſtroyed the citie of Numantia, becauſe in ye firſt Punicke battels, they would not helpe the Romaines. Gracchus a Romaine captaine, ſubuerted the citie of Yſtobriga, becauſe from thence Viriato made him warre. Pompeius hoſte deſtroyed the citie of Italica: for that in the parcialitie of Iulius Caeſar they were moſt faithfull. The Emperour Auguſtus ouerthrewe the citie of Cantabria, as a man more moued with yre, then directed by reaſon. The caſe was thus: that as he had the citie beſieged and brought in great diſtreſſe, he ſent to require of the citizens, to yelde him all their treaſure: and giue vnto Rome perpetuall tribute: The Cantabrians conſidering, what the Emperour demaunded:

aunſwered in a letter after this manner.
               
                  Emperour Auguſtus, we pray the immortall Gods to receiue thee into their defence, and that it may pleaſe them to examine betwixt thee and vs, who in this warre hath more iuſtice: and thou knoweſt, O immortall Prince, that men, although they haue power to take warre in hande, it is not in their handes, but in the Gods to obteine victorie: becauſe we men begin many thinges with malice, the which afterwardes, the Gods do finiſh by iuſtice: with thy exceeding potencie it may not be denied, but that thou haſt brought this ſorrowfull citie into great diſtreſſe: in ſuch wiſe that we haue neither bread to eate, either water to drinke, either skinnes to make garments, or corke to make ſhooes, neither towers to couer vs: but ioyntly with this, thou haſt to vnderſtande, that if wee want armour wherwith to fight: wee lacke not heartes to abide death. It wel appeareth that thou haſt made experience of our weake forces, and vnderſtandeſt not the greatneſſe of our mindes: ſince thou demaundeſt the treaſure of our houſes, and the libertie of our perſons. The mynes that wee haue, be not of Golde to ſerue thee, but of yron, to breake thy pride. Doth it not ſeeme to thee, O emperour Auguſtus, that ſince you Romaines haue fought foure hundreth yeres in ſtraunge countries to be lordes, it were great reaſon for vs to fight in our owne houſes, to eſcape bondage? Proſecute thy warres, and do according to the vſe of other captaines of Rome, and care not to threaten vs, and muche leſſe to flatter vs: for notwithſtanding our countrie &amp; houſes be thine by force, neuer whiles we haue life ſhall wee be, but the Gods and our owne.
               
               This aunſwer being hearde by the Emperour Auguſtus, he did ſweare by the immortall Gods, to take none of them to mercie, either to leaue in the citie one ſtone vppon another. And as he promiſed, ſo he accompliſhed. I would ſaye in this caſe, that if it were euill to ſweare, it was muche woorſe to perfourme the ſame. Although it be an auncient cuſtome, the worde of a king to be kepte inuiolable: for the good prince ought not to put in effect, that which he hath ſworne in his yre.
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. II. Of the countrie and birth of the Emperour Traiane.
               
                  PRoſecuting our intent, it is to vnderſtand that in the dayes when warre was extremely kindled betwixt Iulius Caeſar &amp; Pompeius, the Pompeians helde Yſtobriga, which nowe is named Lebrixa: and the Caeſarians helde Gades, whiche nowe is named Calize: theſe two cities did ſerue to gather their baniſhed; to ſuccour their alies, and their wounded. Before the citie of Italica was deſtroyed by the Pompeians, there did floriſh two famous knights: the one was named Iulius Coceius, &amp; the other, Rufus Vlpius: and theſe two knightes, were not onely Captaines at armes, but alſo were chiefe of thoſe two linages, that is to ſaye, of the Coceians and of the Vlpians. Before that cruell warres entred the citie of Italica, theſe two linages had alwayes betwixt them greate contention: but after warres began, they ioyned in great friendſhip: for that it hapneth many times, that hartes which may not ioyne by loue, do after conſent and agree by feare. The citie of Italica being deſtroyed, theſe two knightes came to liue at Gades, which nowe is named Calize: the one of them that was named Coceius, was graundfather to the Emperour Nerua: and ye other which was named Rufus Vlpius, was great graundfather of the Emperour Traiane, and of the Emperour Adrian by the mothers ſide. The Emperour Traiane was borne in the citie of Calize the xxi. of Maye, in the ſeconde yere of the Empire of Nero, Rufus and Catinus being conſuls. In thoſe times there was not in all Europe, ſo famous, ſo generous, either yet ſo profitable a ſtudie, as that of the citie of Calize: becauſe from Africa they repayred to ſtudie: and from Graecia came to learne. And to the ende it ſhall not ſéeme a fable, let them reade Plutarche in the life of Traiane, Philon in the booke of Schooles, and Philoſtrato
                  
in the life of Apollonius. In that citie of Calize, vntill the age of xv. Traiane ſtudied the Gréeke toung, the Latine, &amp; Rhetorike. Traiane was high of body, ſomwhat blacke of face, thinne of haire, thicke of beard, a crooked noſe, broade ſhoulders, large handes, and his eyes, in beholding, amorous. Traiane entring the yeares of xvj. left his ſtudie, and did exerciſe armes: wherin he was no leſſe towarde then valiaunt. Traiane was of great ſwiftneſſe on foote, and of great readineſſe on horſbacke: in ſuch wiſe that it is ſayde of him, yt he was neuer throwne, or had fal frō his horſe: or euer was ouerrun on foote. There chaūced a certeine fleete of pyrates to arriue at Calize, the which being many, and taking the citizens at vnwares: the good yong man Traiane, did ſhew him ſelfe that day ſo valiaunt in fight, and ſo venturous in conqueſt, that to him alone they did attribut the libertie of their countrie, and the glory of the victorie. Amongſt the Myrmidons, whiche be they of Merida, and amongſt the Ricinians, which be they of Truxillio, there was raiſed in thoſe dayes a certaine little warre for the paſtures of Gaudiano: for that the Myrmidons did ſay, they had held them time out of mind: they of Truxillio aduouched, that they had loſt them, and had receiued of them aſſiſtance to win them of the enimies. The Myrmidons did craue ſuccour of them of Calize, in reſpect of their confederation: the Gauditaines did accept the embaſſage of the Myrmidons, as concerning their ſuccour, and when they had choſen Traiane for capteine of their armie: he made anſwere:
The deſtinies neuer permit, either the gods  commaund, that I take a ſword to ſhed the bloud of mine owne countrie: bicauſe if the one be our friends, truly the other be not our enimies. And ſaid more. Since the warre is not begun, and the cauſe of their debate may be diſcuſſed by iuſtice, it is my opinion, rather to ſende them embaſſadours to bring them friendes: then capteines to attempt wars. Conformable vnto all men, Traianes anſwere was both giuen and accepted: the which from thence forward, was holden &amp; eſtéemed for a knight of great valiantneſſe:

and for a man of great wiſedō and iudgement.
Theſe two vertues goe not alwayes by couples: that is to ſay, valiantneſſe and wiſedome: bycauſe, there be ſome men that be doutie to take perils in hād, &amp; be not wiſe to eſcape thē.
               
            
            
               CHAP. III. Howe Traiane paſſed out of Spaine being a yong man, to goe into Italie.
               IN the ſecond yeare of the Empire of the good Veſpaſian, great Britaine rebelled which is now named England againſt the Romaine Emperour: vnto which warrs Traiane repaired, and this he did without charges to the Romaines, and for him ſelf to obteine fame accompanied with many others of his countrie: In thoſe warres Druſius Torquatus was capteine for the Romaines: who perſuading Traiane to take wages of the Romaine people, as all others did inioy in that warres: Traiane anſwered. The merchaunts that come from thence hither, they repaire to be more rich, but we Gentlemen not to be richer, but more honoured. The fame that Iugurth obteined in the warres of Numantia, that ſame Traiane obteined in the warres of Britaine: in that the one and the other were knights of ſtraunge countries, and young venturours, and alſo fortunate: bycauſe for their powers and noble déedes, whiche they atchieued in thoſe warrs: Iugurthe was king of Numidia, and the good Traiane came to be Emperor of Rome. That daye whiche Druſius Torquatus entered Rome, triumphing of the Britaines, being accompanied not onely with knightes ſubdued, but alſo with knightes and noblemen that had ouercome: all the Romaines did inquire for Traiane to ſée him and knowe him, for that his fame was notorious vnto all men, but his perſon in Rome to verie fewe knowne. And hereof it procéeded in proceſſe of time, when Traiane, and Marius Fabritius, did contend for the Conſulſhip of Germanie: Fabritius taunted Traiane, to be a ſtraunger borne, and diſgraced in the feature of his body, vnto whom Traiane made anſwere: I confeſſe vnto thee Marius Fabritius, that thy good face was knowne in

Rome, before thy euill life: but thou canſt not denie, that in Rome they did not knowe mine honeſt life, before my euill face. At the firſt when Traiane came to Rome, Titus, ſonne to Veſpaſian the Emperour, placed him Pretour of ten legions: and ſent him to the frontiers of Illyria: where he remained all the life of Titus. The Romaine legions did not a little murmur to haue Traiane for their capteine: affirming that in age he was a childe, &amp; in nation a ſtraunger: but after when they found him ſo valiant in fighting, &amp; ſo wiſe in gouernment, they loued him as a father, &amp; obeyed him as a captein. And as in winter Traiane wāted victuals, for that he had taken truce with the Barbarians: a certaine gentleman ſayd vnto him: it is not conuenient thou ſhouldeſt be ſo ſad, or that we ſhoulde ſuffer ſo great penurie: take in good part, that by diſſimulation we break the truce, by which meane we ſhal prouide for our ſelues, and our cattel. The good Traiane anſwered: I am not only grieued with that thou ſpeakeſt, but alſo deſpited with yt yu preſumeſt to ſay: for thoſe matters which we ſet downe by promiſe, we haue not ſo great cauſe to obſerue our fidelitie made vnto men: as for that we haue ſworne by ye immortal Gods. And ye Emperour Titus being dead, his brother Domitian did ſuccéede him in the Empire: which whē 
                  Traiane vnderſtood, preſently he left the charge of frontier capteinſhip of Illyria. The emperour Domitian was not a little grieued, &amp; the whole armie, as alſo all the Senate, ye 
                  Traiane had forſakē ye frontiers of Illyria: for that in matters of warre he had great experience, &amp; no leſſe fortune. The Romaines did vſe great vigilancie, in ſéeking and conſeruing fortunate capteines: with whom they did diſſemble &amp; ſuffer more defections, then with al other perſons: and this they did, bicauſe there be many capteines, that if" they be expert in armes, they be moſte vnfortunate in the" execution thereof.
               
                  Traiane remaining in Rome, without all diſpoſition to take charge of an armie: ye emperour Domitian ſayd vnto him: tell me Traiane, it it doutful that my empire is leſſe

then that which my father Veſpaſian helde? or that I am more ingrate then my brother Titus was? that for them thou ſhouldeſt euerie day aduenture thy life, and for my ſeruice thou daineſt to take a launce in hande? Traiane did anſwere him: I confeſſe that thy power is as great as thy fathers, and thy knowledge no leſſe then thy brothers: but ioyntly with this, thou arte verie ſouden in thy commaundements, and very ſwift in the execution thereof: and it may be, that hauing charge of thy armies, I might be commaunded to doe ſome thing: the accompliſhment whereof, might ſtand muche againſt all bountie: and not perfourming the ſame, I ſhould breake the oth of fidelitie, that I haue made vnto thée.
            
            
               CHAP. IIII. Of the friendſhip and parentage that Traiane had with the Emperour Nerua.
               IN thoſe dayes there was a certaine Conſul named Nerua Coceius, baniſhed out of Rome by the Emperour Domitian, a man in yeares very auncient, and in all that he eyther ſayde, or did, of great credite. As Traiane was at that time in the diſgrace of the Emperour Domitian, frō 
                  Rome he departed vnto Nola, a certain place where Nerua was in Campania: bycauſe It is a thing very common vnto a man afflicted, to ſeeke the companie of an other in like trouble. Theſe two right excellent men, whiche is to ſay, Nerua and Traiane, remained there long time in Campania, poore, baniſhed, perſecuted, &amp; out of fauour: abyding the time when Domitian ſhuld ſend to kill thē, or when they ſhould heare that he were dead: bicauſe if they deſired his death, no leſſe did he ſéeke occaſiō to take away their liues. Traiane, for that he was young, helde Nerua who was olde in great veneration: and Nerua did beare ſo great affectiō vnto Traiane, that he did loue him &amp; vſe him as his ſonne: for that Traiane beſides his ſufficiēcie &amp; ableneſſe for all cauſes, was in his conuerſation moſt amorous. Nerua and Traiane remaining in that baniſhment, found

themſelues of neare kinred and affinitie: that is to ſay, of one countrie, which was Spaine, of one place, which was Italica, and that the one diſcended of the Coceians, and the other of the Vlpians, two famous and auncient linages: of whome we haue aboue made mention. When Traiaane paſſed into Italie, he found no other parētage, but Nerua and Vlpius Ricinius his vnckle: which was two times Conſul in Rome. Some ſay that this Vlpius Ricinius, was father vnto Traiane: but the truth is, that he was but his vnckle: for Plutarche in an Epiſtle that he writeth vnto Traiane, ſayth: The good newes in Rome being knowne, howe thou haſt ouercome king Decebal, which did tyrannize this lande: ſo great was the ioy which the people did receiue, that as thy fathers bones be in Spaine, they had bene here in Italie: they would do no leſſe honour vnto them in the ſepulchre, then they ſhall yealde vnto thee on that day, when thou ſhalt enter triumphing into Rome. And for that Nerua was ſo auncient and ſo honourable, and Traiane ſo valiaunt and ſo wel liked, many Romaines did come and goe betwéene Rome and Campania to ſée them: and this was done more ſecretely then publikely, bycauſe the Emperour Domitian was verie ſuſpicious: being moſt true, Verie fewe dare ſerue or followe ſuch as princes do hate. Amongeſt all other that went frō 
                  Rome vnto Campania to ſée theſe two knights, was the great Philoſopher Plutarche: who with Traiane, and Traiane with him, did plante ſo perfect and ſounde friendſhip, that onely death was able to giue ende to the ſame. And as Plutarche ſawe ſuche abilitie and will in Traiane to learne, &amp; ioyntly with this there was no wars wherein to be exerciſed, he was ſo drunken with learning, that he did abhorre armes: vppon which occaſion Nerua ſaide in ieſt: By my counſel thou ſhalt leaue bookes, and returne to armes, ſince thou haſte better handes to fight, then a tong to diſpute: for that it is not iuſt thou ſhouldeſt ceaſe to be ſingular amongeſt capteines, to be indifferent among Philoſophers. Traiane remayning there in

                  Campania, did marrie with Plotina, which was his onely wife: and is ſayde only, for that before nor after did euer marrie other: the which vertue vntil his time was found in no Romaine prince: for that by growing olde or miſliking of the one, preſently they did take another. And as on a day certaine Romaines practiſed by ſecrete deuice to kil the Emperour Domitian: and in great ſecrecie, gaue part therof vnto Traiane, did anſwere: I do well ſée that Domitian deſerued not to be elected Emperour, &amp; much leſſe deſerueth to be ſuſtained in the ſame: yet neuer the more ſhal I conſent vnto his death: for that I will rather ſuffer a tyraunt, then recouer the renowne of a traitour. Many Romaines on a time murmuring of the inſolencies of the Emperour Domitian, Traiane ſayde vnto them: The intention wherwith Domitian hath intreated me, the Gods haue to iudge: for of his works which he hath done, I may not complaine, ſince he hath bene the occaſion that I haue
recouered Nerua for my father, Plutarche for my maiſter, &amp; Plotina for my wife, and aboue al the reſt, he brought me acquainted with aduerſe Fortune: for that afore I preſumed of nothing but to commaund: but now only to ſerue.
A yeare before Domitian died, or to ſay better, before they had ſlaine him, he went to the wars in Germanie: and in that yeare Traiane was elected Conſul, in the Senate of Rome. It was no ſmal griefe vnto Traiane to accept that Conſulſhip: not for that he liked not to be lincked with the friendſhip of honour: but for the griefe whiche he felt to leaue the companie of Nerua.
               
            
            
               CHAP. V. Howe Nerua was made Emperour, and adopted Traiane his ſonne.
               
                  THe Romains not able to indure the iniuries and tyrannies of Domitian, determined to kil him, the which out of hande they did perfourme: the xiiii. of October, in the fourtie fifte yeare of his age, when he had reigned xv. yeares. In many a day the Romaine people had nor receiued ſo ioyful newes, as ye newes of the death of Domitian: in ſuch maner, that they gaue rich rewards vnto currers &amp; poſtes that brought the ſame, and made great ioy in the countries where they paſſed: for that they did as muche deſire his death, as they did abhorre his life. Petronius capteine of the guard, and Partenius his chamberleine, were the men that practiſed the death, and alſo violated the life of Domitian: and they them ſelues gaue order, that Nerua preſently ſhould be elected Emperour. The Romaines did ſo extremely hate Domitian, that not contented to ſée him deade, &amp; to hale his bodie péecemeale trayling through the ſtreates of Rome, al his pictures and counterfets they did ſpoyle and take away, all his arches and titles they did raze out, all his edifices whiche he had built they ouerthrewe, all writings which he had firmed they burnt, and all that were named Domitians were baniſhed, in ſuche wiſe, that they could neyther indure to ſée him aliue, neither heare him named after his death. The day after the death of Domitian, Nerua Coceius was declared Emperour: and of his election all the Romaine people were much pleaſed: the one cauſe, for that he was ſo vertuous, and the other, bicauſe he was an enimie vnto Domitian. Preſently that Nerua was elected Emperour, preſently he ſent Traiane as Pretour into Germanie, to the end he ſhould take into his power, the legions and gouernement of that prouince: on the one parte, for that Traiane was liked, and muche deſired of all the men of warre: and the other for that Calphurinus capteine vnto Domitian was holden ſomewhat ſuſpected.
               Amongeſt other euill conditions wherewith the Emperour Domitian was poſſeſſed, was: that all thinges which ſéemed vnto him good, riche, or faire, he dyd much

praiſe it, and therof they had to conſider for moſt certaine, that all whiche he praiſed, fréely they had to preſent the ſame: for if otherwiſe, incontinently he tooke it by force.
               Of theſe like things Nerua found in his palace, much goods of other mens: whiche by publike proclamation were all reſtored vnto the owners: In ſuche wiſe, that this good prince wold not only not take frō other men, but alſo make reſtitution of yt which by his predeceſſours had bin robbed. When Nerua was elected Emperour, he was excéeding olde, and of infirmities much perſecuted: for in him there was nothing ſound but his toung wherewith he did talke, and his good iudgement wherewith he did gouerne. The Romaines beholding Nerua ſo olde, and ſickly, complayning that he coulde not ſléepe, and that for weakneſſe of ſtomach, he durſt eate but of verie fewe things: they helde it for moſt certaine, that his life was verie ſhort, and with this motion they beganne to holde him in ſmal eſtimation. Conſidered by Nerua, that he had not long to liue, and that the Romaines did not eſtéeme him: he remembred to adopt Traiane as his ſonne, and to accept him for companion in the Empire: and ſo it came to paſſe, that preſently he ſent him the imperiall enſigne, which was a certaine manner of cape with a hoode, and with the ſame he wrote him a letter, wherein were written no other wordes but theſe: Phoebe tuis telis, lachrimas vlciſcere noſtras. As if he ſhuld ſay: Noble Traiane, thou ſhalt haue charge with thy venturous armes to reuenge my ſorrowfull teares. For the diſobedience which the Romaines committed againſt his commaundements, and the want of reuerence they helde of his perſon, Nerua of Traiane craued that reuengement, bycauſe it is a thing much vſed amongeſt men perſecuted &amp; afflicted, that the iniuries which they may not reuenge with their handes, they bewaile with their eyes. In the time that this did paſſe, Traiane was in Almane, in the citie of Agrippina, which nowe is called Coleine, and the night before that he receiued the imperiall enſigne, and the letter from the Emperour Nerua, he dreamed that he

was inueſted with a purple garment, and a ring put on his right hand, and crowned with a certaine crowne. Only thrée monethes and fiue dayes did paſſe after Traiane was elected Emperour, vnto the death of Nerua: who dyed in the age an hundred tenne yeares, ten monethes, and tenne dayes.
            
            
               THE VI. CHAP. Of the lawes that Traiane made, to the profite of the common wealth.
               AT the inſtant in which Traiane vnderſtoode, that the Emperour Nerua was deade, he departed vnto Rome: where at his comming he did celebrate the obſequies of his Lorde and friend Nerua: and they were ſuche and ſo riche, that it ſéemed rather feaſtes for the liuing, then honours for the dead: bycauſe there was nothing in them yt moued ſadneſſe, but to ſée Traiane goe verie ſad. The firſt thing that Traiane ſayd, promiſed, &amp; ſware in the Senate, was: that no man that was good and peaceable, by his cō
                     maundement or conſent, ſhould be put to death: which he obſerued, al ye daies of his Empire. After this he cōmanded Emilia to be ſent for, which was captaine of the Pretorian armies: whom he commaunded to be diſcharged of his office, and to be baniſhed the Empire: the one cauſe, for that he had diſobeyed the emperour Nerua: and the other cauſe, for that he had imbezeled the payes of the men of warre. He commaunded publike proclamation to be made, that all men that had iuſt cauſe to complaine of the Conſuls, of the Senatours, of the Iudges, or other officers of Rome, that they ſhoulde come foorth and declare: for that he wiſhed ſatiſfaction vnto the one, and correction vnto the other. Perſonally Traiane did viſite all offices of Rome: which is to vnderſtande, where they ſolde breade, where they weighed fleſh, where they meaſured wine, where the merchaunts dwelt, where ſtraungers did lodge, and ſo of al

other offices: among which, he allowed all that was good, and gaue reformation vnto all that was euill. He forbad the vſe of ſhops or tauernes in Rome, that is to ſaye: that they ſhould not ſell bread, wine, and fleſhe dreſt in one houſe: affirming, that prepared vices, is the occaſion to make many vicious. He commaunded all the neighbours
of Rome to be regiſtred: and there was found 285000 houſes of married men, and 42000 young men to be married, 7000 prieſtes of the temples, 32000 common women, 12000 houſes de meſones, and 65000 ſtraunger factours.
He forbad any poore man to goe from doore to doore, but that all which were impotent, ſhould be ſuccoured of the common treaſure: and vnto ſuch as could traueile, they gaue them whereon to worke from the Senate. He commaunded all Iuglars and Ieſters to learne ſome occupation, and to mainteine them ſelues in their owne houſes: and otherwiſe to be baniſhed Rome. Traiane commaunded reformation in all eſtates, and cauſed examination to be taken of al ſtudents: and they were more without compariſon that were baniſhed for vnable and vicious, then remained for learned and vertuous. For that in Rome there were people of many ſtraunge countries, ioyntly therewith ſo many women, of which many did periſhe in childbed: and many children died for want of place to bréede them: For which purpoſe the good Traiane did cauſe to be buylt a famous houſe in the mount Celius, and indued the ſame very well with his owne patrimonie: where all women that woulde, were kepte and brought abedde by the ſpace of two monethes: and that all the children vntill the age of foure yeres were there brought vp and nouriſhed. Traiane conſented not, that in all the yere they ſhould obſerue in Rome but xxii. holydayes: ſaying, that without compariſon, the Gods were more ſerued on ſuch dayes as the Romaines did traueile, then on ſuch dayes as they reſted: becauſe the vices were more which they did commit, then the ſacrifices which they did offer. Traiane did moderate the ſacrifices that were offered vnto the Gods, that

is to ſay, neither to haue ſo many, nor yet ſo ſumptuous: ſaying, that the Gods would rather we ſhould amend our liues, then offer our goods.
                  Vnto the prieſtes of the temple he commaunded to be giuen oyle, vnto the veſtall virgins wheate, vnto the olde horſemen cloth for garments, vnto the poore wood to burne, vnto Embaſſadours wine to drinke: for that all theſe things were not onely in Rome verie deare to be bought: but alſo not at all times to be had for money.
               
            
            
               CHAP. VII. ¶Of the noble and notable vertues that were in Traiane.
               THE yere that Traiane came to Rome to be Emperour, he was of xlii. yeres, in which age, he had in all thinges ſuch ſucceſſe, and did vſe ſuch moderation, that neither by his youth did hazarde the attempt of any fooliſh déed: either by ſlouthfulneſſe of old age, did leaue any thing euil prouided. Traiane was a Prince, in whoſe wordes &amp; workes enuie was neuer knowne: and as on a certeine time the Philoſopher Plutarche did commend him for the ſame, Traiane ſaide vnto him:

                     Plutarche, I giue thée to vnderſtand, that of pure pride, I am not enuious: for that alwayes I thought my ſelfe happie, to enterpriſe ſuche, ſo greate, and ſo notable déedes, that all men ſhould enuie mée for the thinges I ſhould take in hand: and my ſelfe to miſlike no man for any his noble attempts. Traiane was not malitious, either ſuſpicious, although by nature he were of ſharpe iudgement: which hapeneth in few perſons, for ye 
                     commonly, men of ſharpe iudgement, be not alwayes of ſound condition.
                  
And as great affaires naturally bring with them great thoughtes and diſpleaſures: although vnto Traiane they gaue ſome griefe, he was neuer ſéene of man to be angry, becauſe olde wiſedome had more Lordſhip in him, then ſoudeine yre. Althoughe Traiane hadde manye that did wiſhe him euill, and

procure him euill: ſome for malice, ſome for enuie, and ſome bycauſe he did chaſtice them. He was neuer found that vtterly did ſéeke his deſtruction: but that in chaſtiſing the quareller and vicious, they more commended him for his clemencie, then complained or murmured for their griefe and puniſhment Although Traiane were not much learned, he was moſte truely a greate friende vnto learned men: whome he did promote vnto honours and to eſtates, and did much ioy to holde them for his friendes: in ſuche wiſe, that in his houſe and court, a learned man was neuer ſéene in neceſſitie. Traiane did much deſire to vnderſtande the ambitions of Rome, and diſorders of his houſe: but ioyntly therewith he woulde not be aduertiſed by the manner of murmuring, but rather by the way of aduice. Traiane was a great enimie of liers, &amp; no leſſe of detractours: for which cauſe they ſay, yt many times he ſayd: It is more ſafe vnto princes, to haue patiēce to heare their own errours, then to giue eare vnto ſuch as reporte other mens defections: and ſayde more. That of neceſsitie the Prince muſt haue bloudie hands, that giueth eare to murmurers. Traiane wāted ye general vice which vſually reigneth in all men, which is couetouſneſſe, wherof he was not either accuſed or noted: but rather of great bountie &amp; larges, he was of all nations well liked &amp; commended, bicauſe they were infinite that did praiſe him, for that which they had receiued, and no man did complaine for that which he had taken. Traiane naturally did delight in warres, and after they were begunne, verie diligent in proſecuting, and moſt conſtant in finiſhing the ſame. Albeit he was giuē vnto warres, yet therfore he ceaſed not to procure by al meanes to conſerue peace: for as he ſaid, The Gods neuer permitted that any ſhould be ouercome in the wars, but ſuch as be enimies vnto peace. Traiane was verie moderate in the ordinarie expēces of his houſe: &amp; ioyntly with this, moſt liberall in cauſes of war: and moſt certainly in the ſame he ſhewed him ſelf to be a prince ſkilful, prouident &amp; wiſe: for as Plato ſayde, If the expences of the common wealth

be not moderated, afterwardes ye ſhall not faile, to want wherewith to withſtand the enimies.
               
            
            
               CHAP. VIII. ¶Of the proude and ſtately buildinges which Traiane made.
               
                  TRaiane made in Rome many &amp; very notable buyldings: it is to vnderſtande, a great and ſumptuous market place, and all the things that were in the compaſſe thereof. He made a paued calſey, being a broad high waye that laſted two leagues and halfe, whereon they might come &amp; go in Summer without duſt, and in Winter without mire. He made a temple vnto the God Apollo, another vnto the god Mars, another vnto the god Iupiter, another vnto the god Eſculapius, another vnto the goddeſſe Ceres, another vnto the goddeſſe Bellona, another vnto the mother Berecyntha, whome the Romaines named the mother of all the Gods. He repaired the decayed walles, he made tenne paire of milles vppon barkes on the riuer of Tyber, in which he commaunded that the prieſtes, the veſtall virgins, and the olde knightes ſhoulde firſt grinde and be ſerued. He did repaire and inlarge the colledge, and placed gates, porters, and watchemen, and many counterfetes and pictures of golde and ſiluer: and did vſe for cuſtome as oft as he came thither, to be the firſt that entred, and the laſt that went foorth. He buylt in all ſtréetes in Rome publique purging places, and commanded vpon great &amp; grieuous penalties, that no man ſhould be ſo hardie to defile the ſtreates, or other open places: in ſuch maner, that all the dayes of Traiane, Rome did not ſéeme, but as a hall cleane ſwept. In the fourth region ioyning vnto the temple of Serapis, Traiane did buyld moſt ſumptuous baynes, much larger then thoſe which Titus made, and much richer then thoſe which Tyberius buylt. Alſo Traiane buylt an hundred houſes large and ſtrong, wherin

to kill and ſell their béefe and mutton. In the gardeines of Vulcane, Traiane did buyld an houſe of pleaſure, and made therein a certein fiſhepoole for delight: but it is not found or recorded, that he did either eate or ſléepe in the ſame. Neare vnto the houſes of the Fabians, he brought from farre a founteine, in the compaſſe whereof he erected a ſtately houſe, naming it the place of Datia, Traiane naturally, was a friend not onely of buylding, but alſo to beholde buyldinges and worke men: whiche is moſt certeinly knowen, in that he made a lawe: that all ſuch men as ſhould raiſe any newe buyldinges in Rome, the thirde parte of the charges ſhoulde be paide from the common treaſure. It was a marueilous matter, that in all theſe &amp; many other buyldings which Traiane made in Rome, he vſed no other mennes money, he conſtrained no man to trauaile by force, he deferred no man of payement, for he ſaide and helde opinion, that it were more honeſt and alſo more ſure vnto Princes, to dwell in poore lodginges: then of other mennes ſweat to make riche houſes.
               
            
            
               CHAP. IX. ¶Of ſome vices whereof Traiane was noted.
               
                  TRaiane wanted not ſome humaine infirmities, wherein men at times do fall: for, if with reaſon he were praiſed for many thinges: not without occaſion in ſome cauſes
he was iuſtly diſcommended. Vntill this daye there hath béene no Prince in whome all vertues did concurre, either in whome all vices were founde: bycauſe, there is no man ſuch an outcaſt, in whome there is not to be found ſomewhat to be praiſed: either any man of life ſo reformed, that in him there is not ſomewhat to be amended.
                  
                  Traiane naturally was proude and ambitious of honour: and after a manner he did delight, that in open place they ſhould erecte vnto him pictures and counterfetes of golde, and that his fame might be ſpreade throughout the world. In all his erected buyldinges he placed the titles of his triumphes, and perſuaded the Oratours to compounde many méetres to his praiſe, whiche he made to be grauen in ſtone in the hyeſt front of his buyldinges. In the vice of the fleſhe, Traiane was not a little fleſhly: and yet in this caſe it is moſte true, that he neuer vſed force to any perſon: but ioyntly therewith, being moſte diligent in perſuaſion, and verie liberall in giuing: he fixed his amorous affection vppon no perſon, that he inioyed not. In his garmentes, and in the manner of the faſhion and wearing thereof, Traiane was moſt curious and coſtly: bycauſe there was no daye, that either of Golde, ſiluer, or ſilke, he did not on his perſon vſe ſome chaunge.
               As we haue ſaide, Traiane was a Prince both wiſe, and of ſharpe and readie iudgement: but ioyntly therewith, muche affectionate vnto his owne opinion: whereof cares many times did followe and perſecute him: bycauſe, there is not, hath beene, or ſhalbe Prince in this worlde, ſo wiſe, that neceſsitie conſtraineth not, at times, to chaunge counſell.
               
               
                  Traiane was a verie friende vnto wiſe men, but he him ſelfe was not muche learned: whereof béeing reproued by his friende and Philoſopher Plutarche: Traiane ſaide vnto him: the Gods haue not created mee to turne ouer bookes, but to deale with armour. When Traiane had vacant time from warres, he did muche delight to take his pleaſure in vaine thinges, wherein he conſumed many nightes and dayes, and of this vice he was not a little noted, and alſo accuſed: and doubtleſſe not without great cauſe: for that Princes which preſume to bee good Princes, in ſuche wiſe ought to take their paſtime, that they ſeeme not to loſe their time. Notwithſtanding that Traiane deliuered Rome of manye vices,

and baniſhed from thence many that were vicious: he was noted and alſo blamed, that he defended and ſuſteined the ſwoorde players, who were men ydle and ſeditious, and this he did, becauſe in his youth they had béene his frends, and delighted in them: wherin he had leſte reaſon, for that It is not iuſt, that Princes take ſuche recreation for their perſons, as tendeth to the preiudice of the comon wealth. Traiane was verie moderate in féeding, but ioyntly therwith, not ouer ſober in drinking: for that to obteine good wine, he was ſomewhat curious and carefull, and in the drinking thereof, not verie temperate. Notwithſtanding, that ſometimes he dranke ſomewhat more then was conuenient for the health of his bodie, and to the authoritie of his perſon: yet, at that time, neuer man ſawe him committ or procure any vile déede.
            
            
               CHAP. X. ¶Of the firſt warres that Traiane had againſt the Datians.
               IN the xliiij. yere of his age, and in the ſecond of his Empire, Traiane receiued newes, that Decebal king of Datia, which in theſe dayes is named Denmarke, rebelled againſt the Romaine Empire: the which newes gaue no ſmall ſkandal and offence vnto the Senate: for that on the one part naturally they were a nation very warlike: and on the other parte, for that king Decebal was a prince of great vnquietneſſe, and alſo of a minde determined. For that the Emperour Domitian was a greatter friend vnto vices, then an enimie vnto enimies: in all his reigne, king Decebal did neuer yeald obedience vnto the Romaine Empire: whereby the Datians had recouered great boldneſſe, and the Romaines loſt their credite.
               
                  Traiane, in his owne perſon determined to go in thoſe warres: for which purpoſe he made choice of a verie ſmall armie, and yet of much ſtrength: for he helde opinion,

that, as no other meates ſhould be brought vnto the table, then are to be eaten: ſo they ought not to leade vnto the warres, but ſuch as muſt fight: and ſaide further: by experience I haue proued, as well in eating, as in fighting, that many meates at table be lotheſome: and in the warres many men be troubleſome. King Decebal béeing aduertiſed, that Traiane remoued from Rome to make conqueſt of him and his countrie, determined to marche and encounter with him vppon the waye: and as he purpoſed ſo he perfourmed: for he helde the Romaines in ſo ſmall eſtimation, that he counted it ſhame to be béeſéeged of them. And when the armies were in ſight one of another, the Barbarians being ſo manye, &amp; the Romaines ſo fewe: they did not a litle perſuade Traiane, to take peace, or to make ſome honeſt truce, and without peril to return to Rome. Traiane to this made aunſwer: our weakeneſſe ſhould be great, and with great reaſon they would blame vs in Rome, if ſo ſoudēly we ſhould ceaſſe to make warre, without firſt making proofe, to what ende their forces do extende, and alſo vnderſtande what our deſtinies do containe: bycauſe it may be, that if their power be great, our fortune may be much greater.
King Decebal had taken &amp; fortified all the daungerous paſſages, and broken all bridges, barkes, &amp; botes of all the riuers, and had taken &amp; ſpoiled all the victuals where the Romaines ſhould paſſe: and all theſe thinges were occaſions to increaſe trauaile vnto Traiane, but not of power ſufficient to remoue his enterpriſe: for that Traiane was of ſo valliant a minde, that where he ſawe fortune moſt doubtfull, from thence he did hope of victorie moſte certeine. Traiane did take &amp; poſſeſſe the height of the rockes and mountaines, and thereon with all his armie did trauaile many nights and dayes: &amp; king Decebal did neuer conceiue that Traiane would trauaile by thoſe thornie mountaines: for that he thought it impoſſible for men to trauaile where beaſtes could not eſcape. King Decebal was conſtrained to returne vnto the plaine countrie, and to fortifie him ſelfe in ſtrong cities, &amp;

to this ende Traiane did purpoſe not to fight in mountains that be daungerous, but in fieldes that be plaine: for he ſaide, that they came not to fight with the mountaines, whiche bred bruite beaſtes: but to tame cities which ſuſteine ſeditious men.
In very ſhort ſpace Traiane had taken fiue cities, ſeuen caſtels, and many priſoners: among which Mirto was taken, being vnckle, tutour, and captaine of king Decebal: a man of greate grauitie and of no leſſe authoritie. Traiane was ſo rigorous with them that did reſiſt him and ſo pitifull vnto ſuch as did yelde them, that ſome for loue, and others for feare, began ſecretely to practiſe throughout the kingdome, totally to yeald them ſelues vnto Traiane: becauſe they ſawe euery day Traians force to increaſe, and the power of king Decebal to decay and growe very weake. Traiane beſieging a certeine citie named Myrtha, holding the captaine therof in great diſtreſſe, king Decebal forgate not to ſende him reliefe &amp; ſuccour of great power: againſt whome Lucius Metellus, a captaine of Traianes did march and aduaunce him ſelf: who at that inſtant fought ſo valiantly and manlike, that he leſt not of all the enimies one onely perſon, that was
not either taken or ſlaine. And as in that battaile manye Romaines were ſlaine, and many more wounded, lacking clothes to binde vp their woundes, Traiane tare his owne ſhirt to ſupply their want in that behalfe.
Being knowne within the citie, howe their ſuccorour was diſcomfited, and howe Traiane, to cure his wounded had rent his own ſhirt, they did feare the victorie, and were amazed at a worke of ſo great clemencie, and bothe theſe things were not a litle preiudiciall vnto king Decebal, chiefely for that he was proude and diſdainfull: for the good Traiane, if with his engins he ouerthrewe their caſtels, with ye fame of his good woorkes, he did robbe and ſteale the mindes of his armie.
               The citie of Myrtha beeing taken and rendred into the handes of Romaines, preſently king Decebal ſent Ambaſſadours vnto Traiane, aduertiſing that he woulde

become ſubiect vnto the Romaine Empire: vppon ſuche condition, that the thinges whereon they ſhould capitulate, were reaſonable, and ſuche thinges as they ſhoulde commaunde to be perfourmable: for otherwiſe, he and his were determined rather to dye with libertie, then to liue in bondage. The conditions that Traiane ſent to demaund were theſe.
               That he ſhould leaue all armour, diſcampe his armie, ſubuert his caſtels, yelde his engines, reſtore that which was robbed, become a friende vnto the friendes, and an enimie vnto the enimies of the Senate, render ſuche captaines as came to his ſuccour, and giue 100000 peſants of golde to paye the armie, and giue one of his ſonnes in pledge for ſuretie of all promiſes. All theſe conditions king Decebal was contented to ſweare and obſerue: except the rendering of the captaines which came in his fauour to ſuccour him: ſaying that ſo vile a déede did not agrée with the clemencie of Traiane to demaunde it: neither vnto his royall fidelitie to graunt it: for that he yelded him ſelfe and his countrey, but to preſerue the life of his friendes and alies. King Decebal came vnto the preſence of Traiane, and knéeling vpon the grounde, did take off the crowne from his head and kiſſed the knée and the hand of Traiane: the which lifting him from the grounde and againe placing the crowne vpon his head: ſaide vnto him: I admitt thee to kiſſe my knee for the rebellion which thou haſt committed, and I gaue thee my hande to kiſſe for the vaſſalage whiche thou oweſt mee: nowe I giue thee place to ſitt by mee as a friend: I returne thy crowne vnto thee, as vnto a king: and therefore, learne to vnderſtande thy faulte paſt, and to conſerue this preſent benefite: for otherwiſe, thou ſhalt put mee to muche trauaile, and thy ſelfe in great peril.
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. XI. ¶Howe Traiane triumphed of the Datians, and refourmed his common wealth.
               MAny caſtels being furniſhed, and others ouerthrowen and ſubuerted, and the armies being paide with king Decebals money: Traiane departed vnto Rome, leading with him the kinges ſonne for pledge, and other noble
men for Ambaſſadours: becauſe it was a lawe much vſed and alſo obſerued amongeſt the Romaines, that it were of no value which was capitulate in the wars, if it were not confirmed in ye Senate at Rome.
                  
The Ambaſſadours of king Decebal arriued at Rome before the Emperour Traiane: who bareheaded, their armour throwne downe, and their hands ioyned and lifted vp, did humbly beſéeche the Senate, that it might pleaſe them to pardon kinge Decebal the rebellion which he had committed againſt them, and to confirme all that which the Emperour Traiane had capitulate, bycauſe for that which had paſſed, he did repent him, and for time to come did offer amendes. With readie diſpoſition the Romaine ſenate did approue, allowe, and confirme all actes agréed vppon betwixt Traiane and the Datians: and preſently commaunded their armour to be reſtored them, &amp; to walk in ye citie at their libertie:
bycauſe it was a lawe inuiolable, that the Ambaſſadours whoſe Princes helde warres with the Romaine people, might weare no kinde of armour, either walke the ſtréetes at libertie without licence.
Many and moſt extreme were the feaſtes wherewith the Romaines did receiue the Emperour Traiane, &amp; very great was the riches yt he beſtowed in his triumph: &amp; admitting yt the Romains did much reioyce to ſee their Empire riche &amp; in great power: but it did muche more pleaſe them to beholde Traiane returned whole, ſafe, and aliue: for it is incredible, what affection and loue all men did beare him, and the ſacrifices beyonde all valure that for him they did offer.
               
                  On the daye of his triumph, the ſonne of king Decebal was placed in the arche with Traiane, for that he was a verie childe: whome afterwardes he did intreate, not as a priſoner, but as his owne proper ſonne.
In the conqueſt of the Datians, and in viſiting the Germaines, Traiane was deteyned willingly two yeares: and at his returne vnto Rome, he found not the common wealth in ſuch order as he left the ſame, and thereof is no marueile: for Princes making warre with their enimies, preſently the citizens make peace with vices. That day in which Traiane entred triumphing into Rome, he that by chaunce was moſte noted in thoſe playes and pageantes, and of whome Traiane that day did take moſte delight, was a certeine maiſter of Enterludes named Pilas, who for rewarde of his traueile, did not craue of Traiane but licence to vſe his facultie, wherein Traiane did aunſwere him: Princes haue to conſider that their commaundements be iuſt: but after commaundement, for no requeſt or ſeruice they ought to reuoke the ſame.
                  
                  That which I will do for thée, ſhal be to paye thée yerely out of mine owne treaſure, as muche as thou maiſt gaine by playing in the ſtréetes of Rome.
                  
               
               Although Traiane went laden with armour, compaſſed with affaires, occupied in warres, buſied in buyldings, importuned with friendes, tyred with enimies, and aboue all, moſte ſtudious in amplifying his fame, and to perpetuate his memorie: he neuer grewe negligent in good gouernement of the common wealth. He was no leſſe attentiue in hearing, either leſſe diligent in diſpatching baſe &amp; ciuil affaires, then thoſe caſes of great weight in the common wealth. Notwithſtanding he were much buſied in the affaires of warres, he did neuer the more growe negligent in the adminiſtration of iuſtice. All the time that he was remaining in Rome, once or twice a wéeke he did ſitt openly to diſpatche matters of iuſtice.
               For any motion that good Traiane had to be ſolitarie in his houſe, or for any diſeaſe whereby he was withdrawne

into his chamber, either for any affaires that he 
                     •
                  ad for the warres, neuer man came to craue iuſtice, vnto whome he denied audience. When any perſon came, much troubled and furious in complaining of ſome friend or enimie, preſently he ſtopte his eare with one of his fingers, ſaying: that he reſerued the ſame, to heare the accuſed.
               
                  Traiane did neuer ſitt to heare and determine matters of iuſtice, but at the gate of the Emperour Titus, and in the place of Auguſtus: and being demaunded, why more there, then elſewhere: aunſwered, I place my ſelfe where iuſt Princes were wont to ſitt: becauſe in remembring them, I may committ no want of iuſtice. Traiane being on horſebacke, and vpon the voyage of the ſeconde warres into Datia, there came a woman and ſaide vnto him: Emperour Traiane, I am poore, olde, and a widowe: and hauing but one daughter, one of thy houſholde ſeruaunts hath rauiſhed her. Traiane aunſwered: poore woman, be not importune with mée: for I ſweare vnto thée, by the immortall Gods, that being returned from the warres, I will do thée iuſtice: to this the olde woman did replye: and what ſuretie haſt thou Traiane, to returne from the warres: hearing ſo byting an aunſwere, preſently he lighted on foote and deferred his departure, vntil he perfourmed iuſtice with the poore olde woman. Traiane helde for cuſtome, when any perſon did complaine, preſently he commaunded it to be written in a booke which he had in his chamber: &amp; this the good Prince did, to the ende to aſke accompt of the Iudge to whome he did remitt the ſame, or elſe for his own better remembrance for diſpatch thereof.
               In ſome thinges, ſome Princes were equall vnto Traiane, and in ſome thinges did ſurmount him, but in rectitude of iuſtice, there was no prince like him in Rome: for that he did neuer man wrong in iuſtice, either at any time had affection or paſſion in giuing ſentence. Many times Traiane did vſe to ſay: that for Princes to be Iuſticers,

it were right neceſſarie to be iuſt in their owne perſons: becauſe ſubiectes and vaſſals be more eaſily perſuaded to do that which they ſée, then to obey in that which they are commaunded. Traiane was the firſt that placed patrones in the Senate, that ſhould defend the poore: and the firſt alſo that gaue order, that one daye in the wéeke, their cauſes ſhould be hearde. The Cenſours or Iudges of Rome, did ſit but two houres in the morning, and one at after noone, to heare cauſes: and Traiane did giue order that they ſhould be reſident thrée houres before noone, and two houres at after noone, whereof Traiane was much praiſed, becauſe it was occaſion both to cut off ſuits, and to diſpatch ſuiters. In the dayes of Traiane, none that had charge of Iuſtice might augment his goods: but in that eſtate of riches or pouertie, wherein he began to gouerne, in the ſame he had to conſerue him ſelfe: and in repaymēt of his trauaile, beſides the rewardes which the Prince did giue him, his ſonnes were married with the goods of the common wealth.
               Being knowen vnto Traiane, howe immortall ſuites were in the Senate: he ordeined that all ſuites of Italie ſhould continue but one yere, and the ſuites of ſtraunge countries, but halfe a yere.

                     Traiane made diuers houſes in Rome, where the Cenſours and Iudges might aſſemble to heare and adminiſter iuſtice, and alſo made ſtrong priſones, in ſuch wiſe, that this good Prince prouided, that the good ſhould be ſuccoured, and the euil chaſtiſed.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XII. ¶Of the ſeconde warres that Traiane had againſt the Datians.
               
                  TWentie monethes after that Traiane had ouercome the Datians, the ſonne of king Decebal died in Rome, whoe remained there as pledge, for that which his father had ſworne and promiſed: and Traiane was no leſſe greued with the death of that childe, then if it had béene his owne proper ſonne and heire. The day that king Decebals ſonne was dead, they ſaye that Traiane ſaide: the death of this childe grieueth me not, for that it is a ſorrowe to the father, but for breache of promiſe which he ſhal committ: for if he haue béene quiet, it was more for ye recouering of his ſonne, then for obedience vnto the Senate. Not long after this newes came to Traiane, howe king Decebal was rebelled, and to reſiſt the Romaines he repaired the diches, furniſhed the caſtels, entred confederacie with his neighbours, renued and recouered victuals, and more and aboue the reſt, made warre with the friendes of Romaines. The campe of Agius, which was a greate and a populous countrie, being reſtored by Traiane vnto him from whome it was taken, king Decebal reentred, did take and occupie the ſame, in ſuche wiſe, that all thinges which Traiane had ſet downe and determined, was deſpiſed, and in all that king Decebal had ſworne, he was forſworne. Relation of theſe thinges béeing made vnto the Senate, king Decebal was pronounced an enimie, to publiſhe libertie vnto all perſones to giue him and make him warre: bycauſe it was a law amongeſt the Romaines, that notwithſtanding any did mutine or rebell againſte the Prince, vntill in Rome he were declared an enimie, they might not make warre either againſt him or his countrie.
               
               
                  Traiane once more determined in his owne perſone to goe to the warres of Datia, neither woulde he take with him any Conſul or Captaine that was notable in Rome, ſaying: that ſince king Decebal to him onely had broken his worde: to him onely it did apperteine to reuēge the iniurie. King Decebal, howe ſoeuer he had made experience of the forces of Traiane, he would not as in the

former warres abide him in the fielde: but retired into the moſt ſtrong holdes of his kingdome, to his ſmall profite: for Traiane had ſworne before he departed from Rome, to remaine dead in Datia, or bring king Decebal either dead or aliue vnto Rome. Many of the Hunnes which now are named Hūgarians, &amp; many of the Rhenes, which are ye people inhabitant neare vnto ye riuer Rhene, were come vnto ye ſuccour of king Decebal, al which people, when they vnderſtoode that Traiane came with ſo great a power, and ſo determined, they forſooke king Decebal in the plaine field: notwithſtanding, would he not forſake his wilful purpoſe, for that his condition was to beginne his attemptes with great raſhneſſe, and no leſſe ſtout to proſecute them. King Decebal was then of the age of two and fourtie yeares: a Prince moſt certainly in body of perfect proportion, gratious in conuerſation, magnificent in ſpending, valiaunt in armes, diligent and carefull in the warres, although in the ſame moſt vnfortunate: the whiche loſt both him and his countrie: bicauſe little auaileth diligence, where good hap is contrarie. King Decebal was a Prince moſt vnfortunate, to match in contention with Traiane, whoe was a Prince moſt fortunate: bycauſe vnto the one, all thinges did happen vnto his owne liking: and to ye other, all things contrarie to that he did deſire. After fiue monethes yt the warre was begun, as ye one Prince did increaſe, &amp; ye other decreaſe: King Decebal retired vnto a certain caſtel, with the moſt valiaunt men of his armie: where Traiane did vtter &amp; expend the vttereſt of his ſkill, deuice, &amp; policie, to take him: and king Decebal his greateſt force and fortitude to defend him ſelfe. By a Decebal counſel on a certaine night, they conueyed ouer the wall ſixe young men, fayning to be fled, which came vnto Traianes campe, with myndes determined to kill him, eyther with weapō or poiſon. King Decebal had inuented this treaſon: for that wanting, as he wanted ſtrength: he would profite and prouide for him ſelfe, by treaſon and guile. And as Traiane was of a ſincere condition, and nothing malicious, had no

ſuſpicion of that malice and guile, but rather receiued thē with great pitie, and conferred with them a great parte of the day, inquiring and demaunding them of the armies and conditions of king Decebal: and wherefore he had broken his promiſe and othe. There wanted not in Traianes campe, that could diſcerne, by their countenance, geſture and ſilence, that thoſe young men were traitours, or elſe théeues: and one of them being taken and examined, did confeſſe, that by the counſell and commaundement of king Decebal, they were come to murther Traiane. And as king Decebal was diſappointed of this treaſon and deuice, and the traitours chaſtiſed according to their demerites, he determined another deuice: and the caſe was thus. Vpon a truce he craued to ſpeake with Longinus, a famous capteine and much beloued of Traiane: who being come vpon aſſurance, was taken and bound. Traiane was not a little offended, when he vnderſtoode that Longinus was detained as priſoner, &amp; no leſſe diſpleaſed with Longinus, that had giuen too muche confidence to the aſſurance of king Decebal: ſaying, that the perſon which is a promiſe breaker with men, and periured vnto the Gods, by no meanes might deſerue credite. King Decebal gaue Traiane to vnderſtande, that except he might receiue pardon for him ſelfe and all his knightes, Longinus ſhoulde continue priſoner: to this Traiane made anſwere, that if he had taken Longinus in good war, he wold do any thing to giue libertie vnto his perſon: but ſince Longinus gaue truſt where he ought not vnto his worde, he was bounde to conſerue his life: for that good Princes be more bound to mainteine that whiche they promiſe, then to procure that which they deſire. Althoughe Traiane ſpake theſe wordes openly, he did geatly trauell to deliuer Longinus, eyther for exchange, or elſe for money: but Longinus vnderſtanding thereof, dranke poyſon, wherof he dyed: &amp; ſent word vnto Traiane, yt the Gods had neuer to cōmaund, yt for the giuing of his life, they ſhuld capitulate wt king Decebal, any thing yt were vile or againſt honour. This Romaine
                  
ſtraūge act of Longinus, gaue great admiration vnto friends and confederats, and did yeald great feare vnto the enimies: bycauſe he deliuered Traiane of care and thought, and for him ſelfe obteined perpetuall fame.
King Decebal perceiuing the greateſt part of his kingdome to be taken and loſt, without all hope to recouer the ſame, eyther able to defende that which remained, determined to make ſlaughter of him ſelfe, ſome ſay with poyſon, ſome affirme that he drowned him ſelfe in water, other affirme, that he hanged him ſelfe: finally, he was found dead without any wounde: whoſe head Traiane commaunded to be cut off, and to be ſent vnto Rome.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. XIII. Of the great buildings that Traiane made in the kingdome of Datia.
               THe vnfortunate king Decebal being dead, and all the whole lande in Traianes power, he made it a Prouince: which is to ſay, he did take away the title of kingdom, and the preeminence of gouernement by Conſuls: and gaue order to be gouerned by Pretors, and to be called a Prouince. Traiane remoued a greate number of the inhabitants of Italie in that countrie: but many more he brought out of that countrie, to be placed in Italie: and this he did as a man of great iudgement: bycauſe in diſplacing the one, he obteined ſure poſſeſſion of the kingdom: and remouing the other, of neceſſitie they muſt liue as others did liue in the Romaine Empire. When the capteine Longinus dyed, he left a brother yonger of age, but equall in force and valiauntneſſe, whome Traiane made Pretour of Datia, and gaue vnto him for euermore the caſtle where his brother dyed: ſaying vnto him, of two cauſes, the one is for thyne owne vertue and valiauntneſſe, and the other, bycauſe thy brother Longinus did ſerue me.
               
                  
                  Traiane cauſed great ſearch to be made for the body of his capteine Longinus: vnto whome he cauſed to be erected ſuch and ſo ſumptuous a ſepulchre, that it was to be douted, whether he would haue giuen him ſo great riches for ſeruice if he had liued, as he ſpent in making that ſepulchre. In all the kingdome of Datia, there was no knight or Gentleman that had any rents, but only the king: whereof the king gaue vnto euerie man as he did ſerue and deſerue: whereof it followed, that the kingdome being ſo opulent, the king obteined great riches, welth, and power. Whē 
                  Traiane came the ſecond time into Datia, king Decebal had great riches both of gold &amp; ſiluer: not only for the great rents which he receiued throughout his kingdome, but that alſo he exacted of his ſubiectes great ſūmes of money. King Decebal being doubtfull vnto what deſtinies
he and his kingdome were committed, determined to burie all his treaſure in a riuer, which he remoued out of his naturall chanell, and in the greateſt depth therof, he made ſepulchres of ſtone to burie his ſaide treaſure: whiche being done, he returned the riuer into his olde chanell, which was named Sargetia: and to the end that no man ſhoulde diſcouer this ſecrete, he commaunded to murder all that were preſent at the hiding thereof. But to ſmall purpoſe, for that a fiſher, which at that time did fiſh the riuer, diſcouered the whole matter vnto Traiane: in ſuche manner, that there is nothing ſo much hidden, that humaine couetouſnes doth not diſcouer.
                  
Thoſe treaſures being brought into Traianes power, he diuided thereof amongeſt his armies, vnto euerie man according to the merites of his ſeruice: and of his owne ſhare, the firſt that he commaunded was, to builde a moſt ſumptuous temple vnto the God Iupiter: wherein he left prouided, that for him ſelfe and the people of Rome, yearely ſacrifice to be offered. He reedified there alſo the royall houſe, that is to ſay, where the kings of Datia did vſe to be reſident: whiche for the antiqutie thereof was ſomewhat decayed, and through continuall warres, not well repayred: a worke moſt certeinely delectable

to behold, and pleaſant to dwell in. He repaired alſo many decayed bridges and mylles, vpon high wayes he renued their broken calſeys in all places, he did build newe houſes, and reedified others infinite that were burnt. He brake and made plaine many wayes vpon the ſharpe moū
                  taines, and rayſed many newe fortes, and renued the old: finally, you might hardly trauell a league throughout all the kingdome, wherein ſhoulde not be found ſome notable worke of Traiane.
                  Not yet all ſatiſfied, he built vpon the riuer of Danubie a bridge of ſtone, which was ſo curious in the building, and ſo coſtly in the making, that fewe works did match it, but none did paſſe it. That bridge contained twentie arches in length, and euery piller of one ſquare ſtone, and the arches were of the height of an hundred and fiftie foote, wrought without cymet, and the diſtaunce betwixt the pillers, were a hundred thréeſcore and two foote: and the breadth of the arches aloft was fortie foote: and aboue all the reſt, the ſingularitie of the mould and faſhion was to be conſidered, and the richneſſe of the ſtone to be regarded: bycauſe the ſtone was of ſuch gloſſe, that in iudgement it deſerued to be ſet in plate. It ſéemed incredible to mans iudgement, for a bridge to be made vpon that riuer: bicauſe the ſtreame was broad, déepe, in courſe very ſwifte, and aboue all the reſt, on no ſide it might be turned out of his chanell, to the end it might be drie at any time to lay the cymet.
That building was ſo extreme, or to ſay better, ſo monſtrous, that it néeded to make experiēce of al high iudgements and capacities, and the Romaines there to ſhewe their ſtrengthes, and Traiane there to ſpend his treaſure: bicauſe in the worke there required great potencie, and in the order thereof great induſtrie: it is verie ſmall that the penne can magnifie, in reſpect of the wonder which he ſéeth that beholdeth the ſame: for the better credite therof, at theſe dayes the pillers giue a muſter vpon the fierce waters: declaring the pryde of his power, and the riches of the emperour. Traiane would with that edifice giue terrour vnto the liuing, and admiration to his

poſteritie, to giue manifeſt argument, that any thing may not be ſo impoſſible, eyther ſo hard, that with mans hand may not be enterpriſed, and with ye riches of Rome might not be finiſhed. The cauſe that moued Traian to build this coſtly bridge, ſo monſtrous, was, as they ſay, to the end the barbarous people on the other ſide Danubie, might come to fight wt the Romaines, although the riuer were ouerflowen: and alſo that the Romaines that remained there, ſhuld not giue them ſelues to pleaſure and idleneſſe, when they conſidered them ſelues to be in the eye of the enimie. The Emperour Domitian had no ſuche mynde and valiantneſſe: whiche for feare that the barbarous people ſhould come to fight with the Romaine hoaſt, cōmaunded the arches of that bridge to be ouerthrowne: in ſuch wiſe, that the one made a bridge to prouoke the enimie to fight, and the other did raze the ſame for feare of battell.
            
            
               CHAP. XIIII. Of the ſeconde entring of Rome by the Emperour Traiane, and the notable thing which he did in the ſame.
               IN finiſhing the warrs, in giuing order for the Prouince, in diuiding the countries, and in yealding perfection vnto all his workes and buildings, Traiane was deteined in Datia more then thrée yeares: in which as he after did report, great were the trauels and perils wherein he did ſée his perſon, and not ſmall were the expences that he made of his goods. The victories that Traiane had obteined, being knowne vnto the Barbarians that did inhabite the other ſide of Danubie, the mightie buildings that he had made, the great rewardes that he had giuen, and the clemencie that with priſoners he had vſed, ſent their ambaſſadours vnto Traiane: who with verie good will did ſet down with him a perpetual peace &amp; amitie, &amp; bound them

ſelues to kéepe and defend for him the kingdome of Datia. Incredible was the loue that all thoſe nations did beare vnto Traiane, which was well knowne when he departed from that countrie to goe vnto Rome: in that by all cities where he did paſſe, and by all wayes where he did trauell, ſo great were the teares and cries vttered by all perſons, that it ſéemed the grounde to tremble. In reſpect of the great largeſſe and proweſſe that Traiane had perfourmed in thoſe Prouinces, it was no maruell that his departing was ſo be wailed: bicauſe with his great benefites, he had won their hearts, and with his great and ſumptuous buildings he had ennobled his people. Vniuerſally of al friends and enimies, neuer prince as Traiane was ſo much feared in warres, either loued in peace. The cauſe wherby Traiane obteined ſo great loue, and to be ſo well liked, and in ſuch eſpecial grace with al men, was, that with his frends he neuer vſed negligence, and alſo in readineſſe and ſtraite reckoning with his enimies: in ſuch wiſe, that ſuch as ſtood in his diſgrace by his wordes, they had to vnderſtand therof: but vnto ſuch as did bende to ſerue him, both in worde and déede he did manifeſt the ſame. They were infinite that praiſed Traiane, in that he had ben pitiful with them, but none did cōplaine yt he had found him ingrate. Ennius Priſcus, a noble &amp; aunciēt Romaine demaūded of ye emperour Traiane, by what meanes more then all other Princes paſt, of all men he had obteined ſo ſpeciall loue and lyking: Traiane did anſwere, for that naturally I delight to pardon ſuch as do offende me, and neuer forget ſuch as do ſerue me. And truly Traiane ſaide moſt truthe: that loue and hatred haue their beginning of thankfulneſſe and ingratitude: bycauſe there is no enimie ſo fierce or cruel as he which in time paſt we held for a friend, being remoued by vnkindneſſe. All things as concerning Dati
                        •…
                     a, being diſpatched, Traiane returned to Rome. If the triumphes of the firſt warres were great, when king Decebal was ouercome, muche greater were the triumphes of the ſecond warres, when he was ſlaine.
               
                  The feaſts of the triumphes of Datia, endured an hundred and twentie dayes: in which were ſlaine an hundred Lions, and of other wilde beaſtes an hundred thouſande, which is to vnderſtande, Deare red and vallo, Tygres, Bulles, Leopards, Wolues, Beares, Vnicornes, Boares, Panthers, Eliphants, Camels, Ounces, and many other ſuch ſtraunge beaſtes taken &amp; brought from the deſerts of Africa, and the great India. The feaſtes of the triumphe being finiſhed; preſently Traiane commaunded to be made great ſacrifices vnto the Godds, in remuneration of the great perils frō which they had deliuered him, and for the great triumphs which they had giuen him. He commaunded newe temples to be made, one vnto the vnknowne God to the Romaines, another vnto the God Mars, whiche was the God of the Datians. He commaunded greate ſummes of money to be giuen to the Prieſtes of the temples: vnto the end they ſhould offer daily ſacrifice vnto the Gods, for the health and proſperitie of his kingdomes: and alſo to repaire &amp; ennoble their temples. At his cōming frō 
                  Datia, whē 
                  Traiane paſſed the riuer Rubicon, being detained an whole day for want of paſſage, imediately vpon his cōming to Rome, he ſent money &amp; workemen to make a bridge ouer that riuer: whiche was more profitable, although not ſo ſumptuous as the bridge made ouer Danubie. In the mariſhes of Pontaine, Traiane did rayſe and make a calſey both long and large of ſtone, a worke right profitable and neceſſarie, although not a little coſtly: for where as afore there was but water and myre, there ſuccéeded houſes and inhabitants. In thoſe dayes there dyed in Rome, a certaine Phyſician named Suras Lycinus: in whoſe death Traiane did vtter great ſorrowe, vnto whom he commaunded his picture to be aduaunced in the place, and a riche ſepulchre to be erected in the field of Mars. There was in Rome two ſpeciall men learned in letters, and vertuous in manners: whiche were perfect friendes of Traiane, and in the common wealth much eſtéemed: the one was named Palma, and the other Celſus: vnto theſe

he gaue many and great offices of honour, and in the place did erect vnto them pictures of Alabaſter. Traiane made in Rome many and great Libraries: wherein he did place bookes of al ſciences, and of all languages, where ſtrangers might reade, and citizens learne.
Where ſo euer Traiane entered, were it within the Empire, or in a ſtraunge kingdome, he was alwayes curious, in cauſing ſearch for fiue things: that is to ſay, horſes of good race, learned men of good inclination, newe armour, faire women, and auncient bookes. All theſe things, or which ſoeuer of them, were neyther loſt by any negligence: or left vnbought for any money. In the place named Datia, Traiane erected a certaine moſt highe piller, a worke moſt certainely being of one ſtone right ſtately, and to behold, in breadth and height of great wonder.
It is not written from whence that piller was brought vnto Traiane, neyther for what intent he did raiſe the ſame in that place: but as ſome doe geſſe, he ment vpon the toppe thereof to haue placed his ſepulchre: others ſayde, to no other ende, but to perpetuate his memorie.

                  TRaiane being ſoakte with delight in the buildinges of Rome, Rufus Galba Pretour of Africa did aduertiſe, that all Africa was eſcandalized, by meanes of cruell warres, betwéene the Numidians and the Mauritans. Theſe newes being hearde in the Senate, they ſay that Traiane ſayde. The warre grieueth me, but the occaſion to paſſe into Africa doth muche pleaſe me: for that many

dayes paſt I haue deſired to ſée the famous fieldes of Carthage, where Scipio in ſo ſhorte ſpace obteined for him ſelfe immortall renoune, and Hanibal loſt that in one day, whiche he had gotten in ſixtéene yeares in Italie. Traiane departed from Rome by the waye of Sicyl: where he ſtayed al the Winter, and to auoyde idleneſſe he ſcarſely lefte any place in the whole Iſlande perſonally vnuiſited, none that were then aliue in Sicyl, might remember to haue ſéene any Romaine Prince within the ſame: for whiche cauſe Traiane founde many thinges to be repayred in the walles, and muche more to be amended in their cuſtomes and manners. Traiane being infourmed, that many ſtraunge ſhippes did lurke in the hauen of Mecina to ſpoyle, and many pyrates barkes did haunt and retyre vnto the ſame, to execute their robberies, in his owne perſon went to the viewe thereof, and at his owne coſte commaunded thrée bulwarkes to be made, at the mouth of the hauen: whiche eyther for want of diligence of the one part, or too muche malice on the other ſide, the caſe was thus: that before it coulde be finiſhed, the pyrates had ouerthrowne it. Amongeſt the Panormitains, whiche be they of Palermo, and the inhabitaunts of Mecina, of olde time had continued great contention: betwixt whome Traiane not without great trauell, determined &amp; finiſhed all quarelles and debates: and brought to paſſe, that from thence foorth they continued in great friendſhippe. To the ende to perpetuate that peace, and to roote vp all paſſions and vnkindneſſe of that Iſlande by the rootes: to the principall both of the one and the other, Traiane gaue penſions out of his owne houſe, and daily did cauſe them to eate at his owne table. In Palermo, Mecina, and Tatania, Traiane commaunded ſeuerall temples to be made: and the Gods to whom thoſe temples ſhould be dedicated, the inhabitaunts to make choice. Traiane renued in Sicyl the kinde and race of good horſſes, reedified the decayed walles, melted all counterfet money, erected newe caſtles, builded ſtately temples, ſet peace and eſtabliſhed quietneſſe

amongeſt the mutined cities, &amp; gaue many great rewardes: although no liberties vnto the people. Traiane being demaūded why he gaue no liberties vnto the Sicylians, as he gaue vnto other kingdomes: anſwered, bycauſe ſeruitude doth conſerue them, and libertie deſtroy them.
               
               The Winter being paſt, and the Spring come, Traiane paſſed into Africa, and did lande in the hauen, where olde Carthage in time paſt was ſituate: &amp; not finding one ſtone vpon an other, to giue teſtimonie of the foundation thereof: they ſay yt he ſayd. It grieueth me that Carthage ſo greatly reſiſted Rome: but it more forethinketh me, that Rome ſhoulde not be ſatiſfied, but with the totall deſtruction thereof. In the place where olde Carthage ſtoode, Traiane did builde a caſtle more faire then ſtrong, and erected therein two counterfets. the one of Hanibal the Carthaginian, and the other of Scipio the African: but preſently vpon his departing from that countrie, the pyrates layde it flat on the earth. Incontinent after Traiane had arriued into Africa, there grewe a generall peſtilence throughout the ſame, for whiche cauſe he coulde neyther goe to ſée that he deſired, eyther perfourme that whiche he determined. And as the peſtilence grewe ſo cruel, Traiane was conſtrained to retyre vnto ye port of Bona, which was ſomwhat more ſound: and from thence he ſent for the principals of the Numidians, and alſo of the Mauritans: who incontinently in preſence of Traiane, were made friends, and left and committed into his onely handes all their affaires. Amongeſt all the Princes of this worlde, Traiane obteined this excellencie: That neuer man came into his preſence, that denied him that, whiche he craued, eyther diſobeyed him wherein he commaunded: bycauſe in his commaundements hee was verie wiſe, and in requeſting verie humble. Traiane thought to haue ſtayed in Africa, more then two yeares, and yet remained there but foure monethes: and as he ſayde afterwardes, that if the peſtilence had giuen no impediment, he would of him ſelf haue

lefte as great memoriall in Africa, as he did in Datia. Traiane tooke ſayle at the porte of Bona, and came by the ſtreightes to Cadix, whiche is nowe called Calize, a citie of Spaine: wherein he had béene bred, and from whence being a verie young man he had departed.
               
                  Traiane gaue many Priuileges vnto the Gauditains, as vnto his naturall friendes: amongeſt whiche, two were moſt notable: namely, that they ſhoulde be citizens of Rome, and paye no cuſtome or tribute, for any merchandize whiche they tranſported. Traiane did builde in Calize a moſt ſumptuous temple vnto God Genius: whiche the Romaines helde for the God of byrthe. He made alſo a calſey of ſtone along the ſhoare: but it was not all finiſhed, when by the furie of the water it was all deſtroyed. He intended to repayre the pillers of Hercules, whiche by their great antiquitie were then conſumed: and being perſuaded by certaine perſons to erect others in his owne name, to the ende that in time to come, they might be called the pillers of Traiane, and not of Hercules: he anſwered: that whiche I ought to doe is, that as Hercules came from Graecia vnto Spaine, to obtaine honour: ſo ought I from Spaine to goe into Graecia to winne fame.
               
                  Traiane commaunded the bridge of Alcantara in Spaine to be made, a worke that laſteth to this our age: wherein concurreth ſtatelineſſe, ſubtiltie, cunning, and profite. He made another bridge vpon the riuer Teio, neare vnto Yſtobriga, and is the bridge that nowe is broken, at the bankes of Halconeta. Traiane commaunded the way named Publius to be continued, being the waye that nowe is called in Spaine, the Calſey, that goeth from Ciuil vnto Salamanca: and is named the Publian waye, whiche is to ſay, the waye of Publius: for that the firſte that beganne the ſame, was Publius Fabatus, one of the Conſuls that fought with Viriato. That which Traiane made of that calſey, little more or leſſe, was from the Caſar of Caſares, vntil within a league of ye vents of Capara,
                  
whiche be lodging or bayting places: and ſo to be vnderſtoode, not bicauſe the hiſtories do clearely report thereof, but by the pillers which vpon that way be erected: which ſay in their grauen letters, that they were placed there in the dayes of Traiane. And he that will be curious to goe and ſée, (as I many times haue gone to ſée and reade, and alſo to meaſure:) ſhal finde within the ſayde boundes, the name of no other Prince but of Traiane: and before the Caſur which is a towne, neyther after the vents of Caparra, which be lodgings, vpon no piller ſhall they finde Traiane written. The cauſe wherefore the Conſul Publius Fabatus did raiſe that calſey, was to make a diuiſion betwixt the Vetical Prouince, which is Andaluzia, and the Prouince of Luſitania, which is Portugal: diuiding from Ciuil to Salamanca, all on the left hand of the calſey in olde time being Luſitania, and all on the right hande Andaluzia. Betwixt the Proconſul of Betica, and the Proconſul of Luſitania, there did ariſe great contention, vppon the diuiſion of their boundes: wherevpon this large and ſumptuous calſey was erected and perfourmed. Vpon the riuer of Gadiana, Traiane commaunded a long bridge to be made, on the middeſt whereof he built a market place for the merchants of both people, to trade and concurre. This bridge appertaineth to the citie of Merida, which at this day appeareth verie large, and had in the middeſt thereof a diuiſion, ſtretching vppe into the riuer, the hurle of a ſtone, whiche on both ſides came backe vnto the bridge, continued, directed, and ſuſtained by walles, in the compaſſe wherof was the place or market. When the Greeks did firſt giue foundation vnto Merida, they made therein two ſtreates, and the riuer Gadiana betwixt them both, and where Merida nowe ſtandeth, was the ſtronger, and that on the other ſide the riuer was more delectable: in ſuche wiſe, that they helde the one to retyre vnto in time of warre: and the other to delight in time of peace. As the Conſul Publius Fabatus made diuiſion of Portugal and Andaluzia, the ſtreate on the other ſide the

riuer fell to the Prouince of Luſitania, and the ſtreate which is nowe Merida, fell to the Prouince of Betica, and frō thenceforth there was alwayes betwixt thē great contention: in ſuch wiſe, that they ouerthrew the bridge that ſtoode in the middſt of the citie, and the coyne that in times paſt had ben currant, they made of no value betwixt them. This good Emperour Traiane, meaning to cut off theſe ſo old enimities, made in ye midſt of the citie, vpon Gadiana the bridge that nowe is: and to remoue all quarels for walking in eache others ſtreates, he made a market place in the midſt of the bridge, where they ſhould congregate, talk, and traffike of their merchandize. The proſperitie of Merida continued, vntil the time that the Gothes entered Spaine: whiche holding warre with the Silingues, being in thoſe dayes Lordes of Andaluzia: fortifying them ſelues in Merida, by the Gothes were there ouercome, and thoſe generous, ſumptuous, and auncient buildings, throwen
flat vpon the earth. In no citie of all Europe, did ioyntly concurre foure buildings, ſuche as Merida helde: that is to ſay, a ſtately college, certaine conduites and arches for conueyaunce of waters, a temple of Diana, and a bridge that contained a great and large market place: which continued in building many yeares, and periſhed in one day.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XVI. Howe Traiane did paſſe out of Spaine, into Aſia, and the manner that he vſed in the warres.
               AFter that Traiane had viſited in Spaine the Prouince of Betica, of Luſitania, and the Prouince of Carpentania, he came through the prouince of Tarragona: in which yere in the whole land, there was great ſcarſitie of bread: wherby Traiane was conſtrained to ſhorten his iourney, and to haſten his imbarkage: in ſuch manner, that the peſtilence draue him out of Africa, and hūger out of Spaine.

Traiane departed Spaine, with determination not to ſtay, vntill his arriuall in Aſia, and there to take the way vnto ye greater Armenia: would neuer take land in any porte of Italie, but paſſing like pylgrimes, made no ſtay, but onely to renue their victuals. All thoſe whiche trauelled with Traiane, were aſtonied to ſée him paſſe the portes of his kingdomes, as if it had bene the lande of enimies. Traiane had a capteine named Valerius Gracchus: vnto whom the Emperour did beare ſpeciall affection, and did eſtéeme him as a kinſman: vnto this man they ſay, that Traiane ſayd, in great ſecrecie. If I had found warres in Sicyl, Africa, or Spaine, as I found in Datia, whereby I might haue obteined ſome victorie, I woulde not haue paſſed without landing in Italie: but ſince it is thus come to paſſe, I ſweare by the immortall Gods, to ſet no foote a land in Italie, vntil I deſerue to enter triumphing into Rome. High &amp; verie high were theſe wordes, worthy and right worthy to be written in the hearts of Princes: to beholde this Prince that baniſhed him ſelfe from the delightes of his own proper kingdomes, to ſéeke fame in ſtraunge landes. With great determination Traiane did enterpriſe ye voyage into Armenia, wherin he entered, making cruell war: taking occaſion of ye king of Armenians, which refuſed to confeſſe to haue receiued his kingdome from the Romaines, but of the king of Parthians. Traiane not ſatiſfied to make war vpon the Armenians, but alſo entered the landes and territories of the Parthians: bicauſe in the moſt principall Prouince of Trapa, he deteined his armie more then thrée monethes. Parthurus king of Parthians, a man of great yeares, beholding the warres offered him by the enimie, determined to preſent peace vnto Traiane: who being demanded of his Parthians why he diſcouered ſo great feare within his owne kingdome? he made anſwere. If the wars were but armie againſt armie, the Parthians woulde not feare the Romaines: but we fight with the Emperor Traiane: vnto whome the Gods haue giuen ſo great fortune, that it farre exceedeth our great power.
               
               
                  Without conſuming of many dayes, or imploying of many armies, the Parthians made peace with Traiane, and the Armenians did yeald them ſelues as ouercome. From Parthimiſires king of Armenians, the kingdome was remoued, and both crowne and kingdome Traiane gaue with his owne handes vnto his ſonne: and this he did, bycauſe king Parthimiſires had ſayd: that of the Parthians, and not of the Romaines, he was crowned king: in ſuche wiſe, that the good Traiane in remouing the kingdome frō the father, did execute iuſtice: and in giuing it to the ſonne, gaue a ſhewe of his clemencie. Traiane was not ſatiſfied, that the Parthians ſhoulde haue peace, and become tributaries vnto the Romaines, but that king Parthurus by the handes of Traiane, muſt be crowned: and ſo it came to paſſe, that knéeling vpon his knées, he receiued his crowne, kiſſed his hande, and conſented to pay tribute. Traiane did marche through all thoſe Prouinces and kingdomes, and vnto the kinges that did yeald obedience, benignly he did intreate them, and in their kingdomes did confirme them: and vnto ſuche as did vſe reſiſtaunce, vnto others he gaue their kingdomes, and ſent them priſoners vnto Rome. Traiane helde for cuſtome, that in all principall cities of kingdomes or Prouinces: that he had taken by force of armes, he did commaunde to erect a moſt ſtrong caſtle, wherevnto his armies did repayre: and a right ſumptuous temple, wherein to worſhippe the Goddes of Rome. As Traiane did paſſe and trauell, viſite and conquere all the thrée partes of the world, that is to ſay, Aſia, Africa, and Europa: in all which countries he did trauell to leaue of him ſelfe immortall fame: the teſtimonie wherof maketh it credible, that all the Romaine princes ioyntly haue not erected ſo many buildings, as Traiane onely did performe. Traiane did leade his armies verie well furniſhed, ordered, corrected, and alſo in great ſubiection: &amp; this procéeded, that alwaies in his own perſon he did accōpany the ſame, and helde them both paide and rewarded: for as he did vſe to ſay, The hoaſt that of his owne proper

Prince is not viſited and paide, is ſildome or neuer in ſubiection. When Traiane was in the warres, in his féeding and apparel, he did rather ſéeme a companion, then an emperour of Rome: for that ſildome he went vnarmed, and many were the dayes wherein he did eate ſtanding. Hauing a bodie ſomewhat drie and of great ſinowes, he was moſte patient in tedious trauaile of warres: that is to ſay, in ſuffering hunger, colde, thirſte, wette, ſnowe, heate, &amp; perils, whiche he refuſed not as a cowarde, but ſought thē out as one of a valiant mind: for yt in all hazardes &amp; perils, he neuer ſaide vnto his captaines, go: but, let vs go: do: but, let vs do: fight: but, let vs fight. He gaue in charge vnto his armies, not to attempt to burne houſes, ſet fire in corne, ouerthrowe milles, or cut downe orchardes: affirming, that theſe thinges are to be obteined, but not deſtroyed. Whē 
                  Traiane would take any citie, he did not imploye his force in any thing more, then to depriue the enimies of their waters. In the campes of his enimies, he did cauſe to be ſowen falſe newes: that is to wite: that if he had victuals, to ſaye, that he wanted: that if he had money, to ſaye, it was ſpent: that if he had muche people, that they were gone: that if he would ſhortly giue an aſſault, to ſaye, that he would departe: and by this meanes he brought his enimies into negligence, while in meane time he did fortifie his armies. Traiane was of greate liberalitie vnto ſuch as diſcouered the enimies ſecretes: and ioyntly therewith, of no leſſe prouidence, for the entering of ſpies within his campes. When he helde warre with any citie or countrye, he did not permitt his ſouldiers to ſpoile the borders thereof. for he helde opinion, that ſmal profit might riſe to ſpoile the poore villages: and greate hurte and offence vnto the armies, by want of victuals. Vnto a captaine that tooke a ploughman, &amp; kilde his two Oxen at the ploughe, Traiane commaunded to be baniſhed with great ignominie, and to giue the ploughman his horſe, his armour, and all his wages that was due. For no fault Traiane commaunded any man to be ſlaine in the

warres, but onely him that ſlept being of the watche, or the captaine that ranne awaye out of the battel, or did rauiſhe any woman. Traiane was ſo pitifull, that vſually
he did pardon all negligences, eſpecially in the warres, except two faultes which he did neuer remitt, that is to ſay, ſuch as blaſphemed the Gods, and rauiſhed women. Traiane was verie diligent and careful in viſiting his camps, and to kéepe a reckoning of all his armies: and this he did to the ende that no vagabonds ſhould wander amongeſt them: in ſuch wiſe, that no man went to the warres, that did not beare armour, and go to the battell.
                  
                     Traiane held
in his armies maiſters of all exerciſes to teache the young men the arte of knighthood, that is to ſaye, howe to playe at the ſwoorde, to ſhoote in the croſſebowe, to runne an horſſe, to ſkale a wall, to mine a caſtell, to wraſtle with the enimie, to ſwimme ouer a riuer: finally, the greateſt of Traianes exerciſe was, to augment and nobilitate his armie and knighthood.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XVII. ¶Of the honourable titles that the Romaines ſent vnto Traiane, and of the earthquake of Antioche.
               THE Romaines did much deſire, that when Traiane did ſaile from Spaine into Aſia, that he ſhould haue landed in Italie: but when they vnderſtoode of the great victories and proſperities which he had receiued in Aſia, great was the ioye and ſportes which were done at Rome. In times paſt, ſome Princes ouercame the Parthians, and others of them were ouercome: but neuer prince, as Traiane, did make them by feare yeald vp their kingdome: and that of his owne will, knéeling vppon his knées, would by a Romaine Prince be crowned. The Parthians were a people ſo vntameable to be ſubdued, that they ſaide of thē ſelues: the Gods could abſolutely confound them: but impoſſible for men to ouercome them. Many dayes they were debating in the Senate vpon determination, of the manner of

thankes which they ſhould write vnto Traiane, and what enſignes of honour they ſhould ſende vnto him: ſince by his vertue they were all honoured, and by his valiant actes, feared throughout the worlde. All the Senate came to conſent to one aduice, the which in déede was very generous and noble: that is to vnderſtande, that all maner of coyne ſhould be melted within the Empire, and made a certeine newe money in the name of Traiane: wherein Traiane was ingrauen, and in the compaſſe thereof, theſe letters were written: Imp. Vlp. Tr. Opti. Da. Parth. P. P. Tr. P. Con. 2. Sem. Aug. Which is to ſaye: this is the Emperour Vlpius Traianus, which was verie good, and right fortunate: he ouercame the Parthians, triumphed ouer the Datians, father of the countrie, tribune of the people, two times Conſul, his memorie ſhalbe immortal. Great was the ioy ye 
                  Traiane receiued, when he ſawe that money which the Senate had made: and when he read the writing therin conteined: but of all the titles whiche they gaue him, he gloried in none ſo much as to intitle him Imperator optimus, that is to ſaye: beſt Emperour: for he affirmed, yt all other titles he had obteined by armes, but this other with vertues.
For defence of colde, &amp; prouiſion of victuals, Traiane retired in Winter vnto the citie and prouince of Antioche: where whiles he remained, ſuche &amp; ſo fierce an earthquake happened, as neuer in the worlde paſt was euer heard or ſéene. The chaunce was thus, that on the 22. day of October, before the breake of the day, ſoudenly there roſe ſuch winde &amp; ſtorme ſo extreme &amp; importune, that puld vp trées, beate downe birdes, threw down tiles, &amp; ſhooke the houſes: forthwith it began to lighten and thunder, &amp; did ſo ſparckle and flame, that being night, it ſéemed to be broade daye. After the thunder and lightening, preſently did followe ſo terrible tempeſtes and flaſhinges of fire, which with their furious violence, brake downe ſtatelye houſes, ſet hilles on fire, kild men at the ſoudeine: finally, it ſeemed not, but that all the world was on fire, and that the earth did open. And if the earth were

afflicted, no doubt but the Sea was cruelly tormented: for the waters began to ſwell, the windes to alter, fiſhes to be troubled, the ayre to be darkened: and that which ſéemed moſte terrible, the waters did ſo yell, roare, braye, and rage, as if they had béene wilde, fierce, &amp; moſte cruell beaſtes: preſently vppon the ſouden there followed, ſuche, and ſo ſtraunge a heate, that it conſtrained al men to giue aire vnto their breaſtes, vnbuckle their gyrdle, to throwe off their cloathes, to mount into galleries, their bodies to ſweate: and that which was woorſte of all, that if they went foorth into the ayre, the violence thereof did ouerthrowe them: if into the ſea, the rage therof did drowne them. As the windes did vſe their furie ſo ſtraunge or neuer ſéene, and the earth ſo parched and dryed by the drought of the Summer, they raiſed ſo ſharpe a duſt, that the ayre ſéemed to be farſed or compound with duſt. The matter was marueilous monſtruous, and terrible to beholde: the ayre ſo thicke with duſt, the Seas to yell and roare, the windes in ſo furious combat, that one might not ſée another, that they durſt not open their mouthes, neither drawe breath at their noſtrils: for ſo greate was the duſt that they did ſwallowe and receiue into their bodies, that ſoudeinly they fell downe dead vppon the earth. All theſe calamities, and marueilous wonders, were no doubt verie fearefull: but vniuerſally not ſo daungerous: for although many did periſhe, many alſo were ſaued. Then preſently began the earth to quake ſo ſtrangely and vnuſually, that olde houſes did fall, walles did open, towers did cleaue, the monuments did rent, and ſtones did encounter eche other. In ſome places, the houſes were vtterly ouerthrowne, in other partes halfe throwne down, in other places walles opened, in other ſome places trées pulde vp by the rootes, domeſticall beaſtes ſlaine: finally, there was no ſtréete in the whole citie, wherein the earthquake had not vſed his violence. If ſuch deſtruction was executed amongeſt trées and ſtones: howe great was the calamitie that paſſed amongeſt men? the caſe was right

lamentable to heare men crye, women ſcriche, children waile, beaſtes howle and braye, one croſſing and encountering another, ſome dead, ſome with broken heades, ſome with broken legges, ſome lamed in their armes, and ſome ſtriken cleane through the bodie. At ſuche time as theſe thinges did chaunce, great numbers of people were come from all the partes of the worlde vnto Antioche, ſome to ſée Traiane, ſome to aſke iuſtice, ſome that went to the warres, ſome brought priſoners, and others that were ſtraungers: and in ſo great a multitude, there was no man that eſcaped either deadly wounded or hurte, except one woman and one ſlaue. Vppon that night of the earth quake, Traiane was lodged in a place of pleaſure without the citie, who leaping out at a windowe, not with ſuch ſpéede, but that he was hurte on his right arme not able to ſaye of the cauſe, whether it procéeded, of timber, tile, or ſtone. Traiane was ſo terrified with the earthquake, that all the time in which he ſtaide at Antioche, he would not remaine in any houſe, but in the fieldes in a tent, wherein he did eate and ſléepe. Many dayes after theſe thinges did paſſe, certeine perſons walking to behold the falne houſes, heard the voice of a woman: and digging very déepe, they found a woman and her childe, that vnder the hollowneſſe of a vawt were eſcaped: a thing admirable, how the mother without meate ſo long time, might haue milke to nouriſhe her childe. In reedifying of other houſes, they found a dead woman, and a liue childe ſucking the breſt. At the time of the earthquake in Antioch, the mountaine Caucaſus did ſo open and tremble, that all the cities adioyning, doubted to be ouerwhelmed with the fal therof. Running riuers of immortall memorie became drye. Springs neuer ſéene or heard of, did flow &amp; remaine. and olde fountaines for euermore dried vp: many hilles made plaine, and many vallies made euen. Finally, there was no houſe in Antioche, or within the compaſſe of the territories therof, that was not totally deſtroyed, or changed after a maner into ſome other order or faſhion.
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. XVIII. ¶Howe Traiane ſubdued Aſſyria, and what he did in Babylon.
               NOwe when Summer was come, Traiane prepared to departe the confines of Antioche towardes the iourney of Aſſyria, to conquer that countrie, if that by peace they did not yeald the ſame: and being arriued at the great riuer Euphrates, he found the ſhips burnt, all the bridges broken, and all the Barbarians in armes, with a minde to dye, or to defend their countries. The Barbarians vnderſtanding of Traians approche, made an vtter ſpoile of all their woods, to remoue all meanes of renuing their nauie, or to reedifie bridges. Traiane had intelligence that farre from thence, certeine ſhippes vppon the hill Niſibin were a making, whiche preſently he ſent for, and brought in cartes, and in very ſhorte ſpace, a flote vppon Euphrates rigged and armed. The riuer Euphrates being paſſed, Traiane founde another riuer named Peſsin, ioyning vnto the hill Cardius, which alſo was of great ſtrength, and almoſt impaſſable, but Traiane brake vp his ſhippes, and once more by land did carrie the ſame vnto that riuer: wherin he fought with the Barbarians that defended their bankes. And as they after reported, vtterly determined rather to dye, then to ſubmitt themſelues to ſubiection. But that they conceiued, Traiane to be no mortall man, which would fight againſt them, but ſome of the immortall Gods that came to deſtroye them: moued thereunto, in beholding Traians readie carriage for ſhippes by lande, as they had by Sea. That countrie was named the prouince of Adiabena: which being all ouerrunne &amp; brought vnder ſubiection: he paſſed vnto Arbela, and vnto Anguaguemela two moſt opulent prouinces, in whoſe fieldes, in

the olde worldes paſt, the greate king Darius, was ouercome of Alexander Magnus. Traiane ſpent all that Summer in conquering thoſe prouinces: whiche although they differ in names, yet differ not in ſeignorie, becauſe they be alwayes annexed vnto the kingdome Aſſyria, whiche the Barbarians changing the S. into T. do call the ſame Attyria. And nowe when Summer began to decline, Traiane determined to winter at Babylon: in all which way he neither found enimies that did reſiſt him, either friends to accompany him: becauſe thoſe deſertes be ſo ſolitarie and drye, that hardly bruite beaſtes be found in the ſame.
Before Traiane did enter Babylon, he would firſt perſonally ſée the lake of Bytamin: the water whereof hath this propertie, that bricke, tile, ſande, lime, or chalke, that is tempered therewith, maketh a cyment thereof ſo harde and ſtrong, that yeldeth not vnto ſtone or yron. With this water the tiles and brickes were made, and all other mater tempered, that did erect all ye walles of Babylon. Alſo Traiane went to ſée the caue where ye water came ſoaking foorth, whereout procéeded a ſtench ſo peſtilential, that kilde all cattel that came neare thereunto, and all birdes that did flye ouer the ſame. Men that paſſe that waye dare not venter the viewe thereof, muche leſſe to approch the ſmell, except the Eunuches that be gelded, which feare not to beholde, neither are indaungered by the ſauour.
                  Traiane might not be ſatiſfied with the view and contemplation of Babylon, muche delighting to viewe the infinite antiquities therein conteined, and had thereof great compaſſion: and alſo ſaide it many times, howe many and howe renowned Princes had conſumed there their treaſure, and imployed the chiefeſt parte of their life, to perpetuate their fame, which were nowe forgotten, and their ſtately buyldings vtterly ruinated and falne downe. Traiane attempted a certeine woorke within that lande which did not onely excell all that he had done in Rome, Italic, Sicyl, Datia, and Spaine, but alſo all that Ninus, Belus, Semyramis, and Alexander had made in Babylon.

Traiane was of ſo high thoughtes, and ſo ſingular in his conceites, which he attempted, and in his buyldings which he erected, he was not ſatiſfied that others ſhould thinke him equall with Princes paſt: but iudge and confeſſe him to be ſingular amongeſt the reſt. The caſe was thus: he opened the mother of the riuer Tygris, and of the riuer Euphrates: &amp; made from the one to the other, a great &amp; a déepe chanell, to vnite them both into one ſtreame: a thing for the preſent eaſie to be written, but at that time, verie terrible to beholde: becauſe the chanell that Traiane cauſed to be made from the one riuer to the other, was ſo high, ſo large, and ſo déepe, that verie greate ſhippes might turne, ſaile, and ride at anchor. Vppon that chanell Traiane did builde a moſte ſtately and a right loftie bridge, a ſtrong caſtell, a riche and ſumptuous palace, and certeine gardeines and orchardes moſt pleaſant, and on either ſide the riuer, he built faire houſes to dwell in, and ſtore houſes for merchaunts: and to place there his perpetuall memorie, did name the ſame Traianicall Babylon. This buylding endured not long, and the cauſe thereof procéeded, that the riuer Euphrates had his channell more high then the riuer Tygris, whereby Tygris did increaſe, and Euphrates diminiſh: and the Babylonians doubted the one for want of water to be loſt: and the other with the furie of the water to be deſtroyed. From Babylon, Traiane departed to the citie Teſiphont being the head of that prouince: which although ſome dayes it ſtoode in defence of it ſelfe, in the ende it came to be yealded: and there it is ſaid, that Traiane found ſo greate ſummes of money, that he had ſufficient to pay his armies, to raiſe vp newe buyldings, and alſo to furniſhe his treaſurie. Greate were the newes that daily came to the Senate, of the marueilous victories which Traiane obteined throughout the worlde, and howe beyond all Princes paſt, he had augmented the Empire of Rome.
               
               The inhabitants of Teſiphont were ignorant to ſacrifice vnto the Gods, or to obſerue feaſtes and holy dayes:

whereupon Traiane commaunded to erect a temple vnto the greate God Iupiter, and gaue them inſtruction, what feaſtes they ſhoulde obſerue, and howe they ſhould ſacrifice vnto their Gods.
            
            
               CHAP. XIX. ¶Howe Traiane, after great trauaile to paſſe into the Indiaes, was conſtreined to retire.
               ALl theſe countries being ouercome and ſett in order, Traiane determined to ſaile by the read Sea, which is very great, and runneth from the Ocean of the Indiaes, vnto Arabia, and is otherwiſe named the Sea Eritrean, in memorie of king Eritreus which in old time reigned there. The riuer Tygris in the diſcourſe of his currant maketh an Ilande, conteinining xxx. miles in bredth, and lx. in length: wherein reigned Athabilus a Prince both proude and warlike: whome without armes Traiane brought vnder his Empire. The ayre of thoſe Seas being different in nature from other Seas, and being then in the greateſt heate of Summer, Traiane in that nauigation paſſed much trauaile and perill: and being perſuaded by certeine to forſake the Sea, and take the land, aunſwered: the vicious go from hence to Rome to ſéeke delight, and the vertuous come from Rome hither to ſéeke trauailes: bycauſe our predeceſſours in exchaunge of great trauailes, receiued great and glorious triumphes: wherefore I will neuer ceaſe fighting for feare, either nauigation for perill or daunger. At the mouth of thoſe Seas, there was a people named Sipaſsinos, ſo called of certeine fieldes whiche they helde: whether from manye partes they brought their heards to féede: theſe Sipaſsinos were ſubiects to king Athabilus: who vnderſtanding of his ſubmiſſion vnto the Romaines, ioyntly with great good will came foorth to receiue Traiane. Paſſing along thoſe Ilandes, and all the cities

along ye Sea coaſts on either ſide being ſubdued, Traiane entred the Ocean Sea, and therewith vnderſtanding the wracke &amp; decaye of his ſhippes, the darkeneſſe of ye ayre, &amp; his pylots to want experience vpon thoſe coaſts, he arriued to land to renewe his nauie. Traiane was informed, yt thoſe Seas were of ſuch condition, that they endured not ſhippes made of ſtraunge timber, but of wood of the Indies, for otherwiſe they did conſume, or at times drowne them. The ſorrowe of Traianes harte, might not be expreſſed, for that, to paſſe into the great Indies, he had no preparation, becauſe of ye inſufficiēcie of his own ſhips, and want of timber of the Indies. And when Traiane ſaw his voyage to be fruſtrate &amp; without remedie, they ſaye, yt he ſaide with a great ſigh: Of all Princes paſt, onely vnto Alexander I giue the preeminence, for that he paſſed into the Indies: but if fortune had not hindered mee: him, as others, I woulde haue excelled: for I had a wil not only to conquer all the Indies, but therein to haue erected a nowe Rome. All the time that Traiane ſtayed there, he gaue him ſelfe particularly to vnderſtand of the ſtate of al thinges in the greate Indiaes: that is to ſaye, what Gods they worſhipped, what temples they helde, what kinges they obeyed, what dyet they vſed, what garmentes they did weare, howe they did fight, in what cities they did inhabite, wherein they were exerciſed: and howe muche the greater things they did report: ſo muche the more, the ſorrowe of his heart did augment. From thence Traiane ſēt certeine meſſengers vnto Rome, with great riches for the treaſurie: Alſo a memoriall of all the prouinces, kingdomes, Ilandes, nations, and people that he had ſubdued and takē, and brought vnder the Empire of Rome. Great ioy was receiued in Rome vpon the manifeſtation of theſe newes: no leſſe wonderfull vnto the Romaines, to read ſo many, and ſo variable people to be ouercome by Traiane: becauſe it was affirmed amongeſt them in the Senate of Rome, that none had ſéene them, either as muche as to
haue heard of them. Preſently they erected in Rome vnto Traiane an arche triumphant, wherin was grauen the

names of the kingdomes that Traiane had ſubdued, and ye principall prouinces that he had taken: for if they ſhuld haue placed them all, conformable vnto his memoriall, they ſhould want marble to be wrought, and workemen to graue the ſame. When Traiane might not paſſe into the great Indies, he came vnto the houſe of Alexander the greate, where (as it was ſaide) he died: and there did buylde all that by antiquitie was decayed &amp; falne downe: &amp; alſo did adde other newe buyldings thereunto, &amp; offered riche ſacrifices vnto the Gods, in memorie &amp; reuerence of Alexander.
                  
                  Traiane ſayling on the Ocean Sea towardes the Indians, &amp; the Teſiponts, ſuppoſing that he ſhould neuer returne into that prouince, determined to rebel, and therwith ſlewe all the Romaines, that remained in garriſon, &amp; brought all their countrie in armes. Againſt theſe &amp; other people that rebelled, Traiane ſent Maximinus and Lucius wt an armie of greate power, who fought moſt vnfortunatly: for that ye one fled, &amp; the other died. He that eſcaped was Lucius, who to refourme all faultes paſt, tooke the citie of Niſibin &amp; Edeſſa, which he deſtroyed &amp; burnt wt fire, wherof Traiane was not a little offended: becauſe in the warres, he would not any ſpoile to be made by fire. Eritius Clarus, &amp; Alexander Seuerus, two Romaine Pretours, made their entrie by Seleucia, whiche they totally did ſacke &amp; deſtroy: being aduertiſed ye 
                  Traiane was drowned at Sea, they rebelled &amp; ſlewe ye 
                  Romaine magiſtrates. Traiane doubting the rebellion of the Parthians, entred their countrie, hauing intelligence of the death of Parthurus their king, &amp; the alteration of their kingdom. Traiane commaunded all the principals of Parthia to appeare before him, who aſſēbled in the fields of Teſipont, where Traiane being aduaunced did aduertiſe thē of his determination, which if they did admitt &amp; conſent vnto, they might ſafely hold him for a pitifull father: and otherwiſe they ſhould finde him a moſt cruell enimie.
               The Parthians ioyntly aunſwered, that their deſire was much more to hold him as a father, then an enimie: and did yeld them ſelues both to beléeue, and to obey him:

making their humble ſuite, to giue them no king, except he were a natiue of their kingdome: for that a ſtraunger ſhould want both loue and obedience. Preſently Traiane tooke a crowne in his handes and ſet it vppon the heade of Perſnapate, declaring him to be their king and lorde, of which prouiſion they helde them ſelues marueilouſly wel pleaſed, for that he was not onely of their kingdome, and well knowen vnto them, but alſo bothe vertuous and warlike.
            
            
               CHAP. XX. ¶Howe Traiane comming from Aſia to triumph in Rome, was ſtaide by death in Sicyl.
               THE land of Parthians being ſtayed &amp; pacified, Traiane was in diſpoſition to go to Rome: partly to reſt, and to ceaſe from traueile, and chiefely to triumph ouer ſo many nations and kingdomes: but being aduertiſed of the rebellion of the Agarens, and that the Romaine pretours were fledd: preſently Traiane departed vnto the lande of Agarens, which is in Arabia, hauing a citie as principall of their prouince, very little, but marueilous ſtrong: the deſtinie whereof was ſuch, that being ſieged by infinite Princes, was neuer taken or ouercome. For defence of that citie, the nature and ſituation of the countrie did not a litle helpe: for that the aſſailants had neither wood or timber to aduaunce their engins, either water or forage, for reliefe of them ſelues or cattel: &amp; the ſame vnto ſtraungers not vſed thereunto, did rather ſéeme to burne, then to giue light. Traiane commaunded an aſſault to be giuen vnto the citie: the moſt valiant captaines being mounted vpon the wall, at an inſtant ſome were ſlaine, and ſome ouerthrowen. Traiane diſguiſed, and in diſpoſition to viewe the citie, was of the enimies both knowen, wounded, and his Squire ſlaine.
               
                  The Agarens beeing demaunded, if at that inſtant they had notice of the Emperours perſon: they aunſwered, that his grauitie, and the maieſtie of his preſence did diſcouer his eſtate. Traiane being at that ſiege, there aroſe terrible lightening and thunder, which in that countrie was neuer ſéene: and beſides, there deſcended vppon the Romaine campe flies ſo many &amp; importune, that both their meate and drinke, and their owne perſons, were continually couered with the ſame. Traiane conſidering the citie to be impregnable, did retire his armie. They ſaye, that he ſaide, at his retraite: Since the Agarens, with mine armies, either my wordes, be neither ſubdued or perſuaded: the deſtinies haue reſerued this triumph for ſome other Prince in the world to come.
                  In the prouince of Cyrene, Traiane had a greate armie both of Greekes as of Romaines: and the pretor of thoſe armies was a certeine Romaine named Andreas, againſt whome the Iewes of thoſe partes did rebell, and ſlewe both captaine, Greekes, and Romaines. The Iewes were not onely contented to haue ſlaine the Romaines, but alſo brought the dead bodies vnto the ſhambles, and there did quarter, cut in péeces, and ſolde by weight: &amp; with no leſſe appetite did eate that humaine fleſhe, then if it had béene hennes and feſants. Adding crueltie vppon crueltie, they brought forth certeine Romaines whiche they had in priſon, and did wage one with another, a denéere, or a point, to ſtrike off the head of a Romaine at a blowe. Another thing, not more vile then horrible, the Iewes committed vppon thoſe miſerable Romaines, that is, they fleyed them quicke, and tanned their ſkinnes for leather: and further, with greateſt diſgrace, did cut off their moſt ſhamefaſt partes, and plaide and toſt them as a ball in the market place. As the Iewes left no Romaine vnſlaine, ſo left they no crueltie or kind of death that they did not experiment: and in this matter, we haue no leſſe to marueile, at ye hearts of the one to execute, then of the patience of the other to ſuffer. That which was don by ye 
                     Iewes of Cyrene, was executed by ye 
                     Iewes of Aegypt,
                     
and of the Ilands of Cypres, who ſlewe all the Romaines within their common wealthes: which ſlaughter was no leſſe, then 500000 Greekes and Romaines.
                  
When theſe ſorrowfull newes came vnto Traiane, he was very ſicke: but notwithſtanding prouided what was conuenient for ſo deſperate a caſe: and preſently ſent Lucius into Cyrene, Marcus into Cypres, and Seuerus into Aegypt: who committed ſo great ſpoiles among the people, and executed ſo cruell iuſtice vppon the inhabitants, that if the dead had béene liuing, they would haue yelded them ſelues for ſufficiently reuenged. Elius Adrianus was captaine vnto Traiane for the guarde of Syria, and hearing what had paſſed in this matter, ſoudeinly he deſcended into Iurie, and did execute therein a greate ſlaughter: and they of Cypres, receiuing warning by this great treaſon, did ordeine that no Iewe ſhoulde dare to inhabite, or paſſe into that kingdome: and that if tempeſt ſhoulde bring them by chaunce into that Ilande, to haue no redemption therof, but by the loſſe of their heades.
               
                  
                     Traiane naturally was alwayes of greate health: but
in the traueile of ſo many prouinces, following of ſo many warres, ſayling vpon ſo many Seas, and enduring ſo many woundes, the griefe or diſeaſe of the piles did not a little vexe him. But the caſe was thus: that from the daye that Traiane might not paſſe into the Indies, they neuer ſawe health in his perſon, or ioy in his face. Through the cauſe or diſeaſe of the piles, at chaunge of weather, Traiane had a fluxe of bloude, which for his health was very profitable. Either by the colde which he had paſſed, or angers which in him ſelfe he ſuffered, or greate age, wherewith he was laden: there increaſed vnto the good Prince, a Paſma or numneſſe of his arme, and his purgation by fluxe of bloud was ſtopped. Ioyning vnto the citie of Seleuca, there were certeine famous bathes, whereunto ſicke people of all partes did concurre, whether Traiane did cauſe him ſelfe to be remoued, to make proofe for recouerie of his health. And as experience, did after declare,

thoſe bathes did not profite, but hinder: for being weake, conſumed, and ſpent, although he had force to bathe, he had no ſtrength to ſweate. Nowe when Traiane ſawe him ſelfe without hope of life, he wrote a letter vnto the Senate of Rome, commending the ſtate of his houſe vnto Lucius, and the affaires of the warres vnto Elius Adrianus. He dyed in the citie of Seleuca which is in the prouince of Sicyl, which from thence foorth was named Traginopolis, in the age of 63. yeres, and in the reigne of his Empire 21. yeres, 6. monethes, and 15. dayes.
               
            
         
         
            ¶The life of the Emperour Adrian: Compiled by ſir Anthonie of Gueuara, Byſhoppe of Mondonnedo, Preacher, Chronicler, and Counſeller vnto the Emperour Charles the fift. (⸫)
            
               CHAP. I. ¶Of the linage from whence Adrian deſcended, and of the place and countrie where he was bred and nouriſhed.
               
                  THE greate Emperour Traiane being dead, Adrian ſuccéeded in the Empire: who was ſeruaunt, friend, and couſin of the ſaide Traiane. The beginning and linage of Adrian by the fathers ſide, was of Italie, borne in a citie named Hadra: and of the mothers ſide a Spaniard, borne at Cades, whiche nowe is named Calize, a citie of Andoloizia.
               
               
                  His fathers name was Elius Adrianus maried vnto a woman of Spaine named Domitia Paulina, a woman ſufficient wiſe and faire, borne in the citie of Calize, ſhée was néece vnto the Emperour Traiane &amp; his ſiſters daughter, whome he did much loue, for that of a childe ſhée was bred in his houſe. Adrian had a ſiſter named Paulina, who was married vnto a Conſul named Seuerinus: and the graundfather of Adrianus was named Marillinus, of the linage of the Priſcans: which linage did not a little floriſhe in the time of the Scipions. Adrian was borne in Rome the 9. daye of Februarie, in the conſulſhip of Veſpaſianus ſeptimus, and Titus quintus: 
                  in the yere of the foundation of
Rome 488. Adrian had an high bodie of perfecte proportion, except his necke, which was ſomewhat ſtouping, his noſe ſomewhat hawked, his face ſwart, his eyes more grey then blacke, his bearde blacke and thicke, his handes more of ſinewes then of fleſhe, his head great and round, and a broade forehead, a great ſigne (as he had) of greate memorie.
When his father dyed he was but of ten yeres, who left him for tutors, Vlpius Traianus, and Celius Tatianus, the one béeing his vnckle, and the other his friend: effectually requeſtinge to traine and inſtruct that childe in wiſedome and valiantneſſe: for that he had no leſſe abilitie for the one then for the other.
               At the age of tenne yeres, Adrian ſtudied Grammar, and after his fathers death, his tutours ſet him to learne the Greeke tongue, wherein he was ſo learned and expert, that for excellencie therein, in Rome they named him the Greeke childe: for that he was as readie in the Greeke tongue, as others in the Romaine ſpeache. At the age of xvi. yeares, he had a deſire to paſſe into Spaine, to ſée his olde countrie, he arriued at Calize, where his mother was borne, and from whence Traiane was natiue, and there leauing his letters, did exerciſe him ſelfe in armes: becauſe in thoſe dayes the Spaniardes had there a famous ſtudie of ſcience, and the Romaines helde there a ſchoole for the warres.
               
                  
                  Adrian bothe in leaping and running was verie light: wherein it is ſayd of him, that he ranne for many wagers, and not a fewe times by running and leaping, did winne, to ſupply his neceſſitie. He greatly delighted to ride ſwift running horſes, and did much preſume, to iudge and make choyce of them: and after in his olde age, he would vaunt and ſay of him ſelfe, that he neuer roade in coche, mule, or other beaſt, but an horſe. In the time of Adrian his youth, he was an enimie to idleneſſe, and alſo of them that were giuen therevnto: and many times ſayde, that he remembred not ſince the age of tenne yeares, whether hee ſtoode ſtill, or walked by the way, that he had not eyther a booke to reade in, or ſome weapō to fight with.
                  
                     Adrian was naturally ſharpe of wit, and of great life, moſt apparant, in that he was not ſatiſfied, to knowe what ſome men did knowe: but trauelled to haue ſkill in all things that men vnderſtoode: with Philoſophers he woulde diſpute, with maiſters at weapons he woulde fight, with artificers he would worke, and with painters he would paint. Adrian did praiſe him ſelfe, and according to writings of olde time, he had great reaſon ſo to do: bycauſe there was no Art, ſcience, occupation, or inuention in the worlde, that he knew not, or at the leaſt did not trauell to knowe. When Adrian was young, he was but of ſmall patience, for that he indured not any to excell him, neyther yet to compare with him: and rare was that quarell, which he did not make or mainteine.
When Tatian, Adrians tutor, did reprehend him for his impatience, and bycauſe he was not mylde, as the young man his couſen Emilius, he made anſwere: My couſen Emilius is not patient, but for that he is a coward, and I by quarelling, am become valiaunt. Neyther being a childe, or growne to more yeares: Adrian vſed not to breake foorth into foule wordes, although they ſayde, or did him great iniuries: but indéede, although his toung were ſlowe, his handes were very ready. Adrian was of a ſound bodie, except that ſometimes he complained of his left eare, and that one of his eyes at times did water: but

two euils did not hinder his hearing, much leſſe his ſight.
            
            
               CHAP. II. Of ſome euill inclinations that poſſeſſed and had power in Adrian.
               THe Emperour Adrian did muche delight in hunting, which he did not exerciſe in the plaines, but in mountaines for he tooke no care to flée with haukes, but to fight with fierce beaſtes, to make a ſhewe of his valiauntneſſe. So giuen and ſo venterous was Adrian in his chace, that with great reaſon I will not ſay did reproue, but note, the time that he conſumed: and that not onely for much time he ſpent therein, but for that many times he was in great daunger. It hapned ſomtimes, that in following the chace of wilde beaſts, Adrian did looſe himſelf, in thoſe rough and craggie moūtaines: wherof there folowed not a few times, that he would haue eaten if he had had breade, and woulde haue dranke, if he had had water. When he went to hunt, he carried his croſbowe to ſhoote, his quiuer of quarels, and his wallet of victuals: and alwayes did place him, in the pace, where the beaſt ſhould paſſe: and had ſo little feare, and ſo deſirous of chace, that if it were a beare, he did execute ſome aduenture: and if it were a Lion, he did abide him. It is not read, that he ſiue any Lion, but one: but beares and other cruell beaſtes, that he ſiue with his owne hands, were infinite. Adrian followed moſt fiercely a certaine beaſt with ſo great deſire, and did ſo trauel to attain the ſame, that he fell ouer a rocke, put his ſhoulder out of ioynt, brake one of his legs, and caſt much bloud out of his mouth. In the Prouince of Miſia, Adrian built a citie, which he did name The chace of Adrian, bicauſe there he vſed to pitch his Pauilion, and from thence at mornings he went foorth to hunt, and at night did returne to bed. He had an horſſe very ready for hunting, which would ſtaye and make ready as a man, when he vnderſtoode the chace comming: and therewithall ranne as ſure downe the hill, as vp the hill. This horſſe was named Boryſtenes, which being deade, Adrian did not only cauſe to be buried with

muche honour, but alſo commaunded for the ſame a very riche ſepulchre of Marble to be made and erected.

                     Adrian did muche eſtéeme and delight, to paynt figures and counterfets very naturally, and to graue in Marble with great ſkil and deuice: ſometimes in waxe to make newe inuentions: and was in theſe Arts ſo curious, that he made the Goddeſſe Venus in Alabaſter, and with a pencill did paint the wars of Carthage: and of ware did fourme the whole Iſland Creta. And albeit, that in theſe things he were readie and expert, ioyntly therewith he was very ambitious: bycauſe he had as great enuie, and alſo rancour at an artificer, which was ſayde to paynt or worke more curiouſly then him ſelfe, as if the maintenance of his liuing had conſiſted therein. There were in Rome two excellent men, the one named Dionyſius, the other Mileſius, men right famous in the liberall Arts: for that many in Rome did frequent their ſtudies, but muche more did peayſe their workes: Adrian did take thereof ſo great enuie, that although he found no cauſe to kill them, he wanted not occaſion to baniſh them. A certaine ſkilfull carpenter in drawing plots for buildings, being in ſome queſtion with the Emperour Traiane, of the fourme and manner of placing of a ſtaire, Adrian being preſent, ſayd his iudgement ſomwhat beſides ye purpoſe: whervnto ye carpenter Polydorus anſwered: Maiſter Adrian, if your cunning did not ſerue you better to paint gourdes and coocumers, then to place ſtaires, you ſhuld obteine a ſmal credite amōgſt painters, as you haue amongſt artificers.
                  
Although Adrian could diſſemble thoſe words, he might not in any wiſe forget them: for after ye death of Traiane, he attaining the empire, thoſe iniurious words were no more coſtly vnto the ſorrowfull Polydorus, but to ſerue Adrian for ſufficient reuenge, to take away his life. Adrian being ſo great a Grecian, and alſo a Latiniſt, compounded certaine workes in Heroicall metre, as alſo in preaſe, &amp; did muche delight to haue them praiſed, &amp; could not indure but ye ſome muſt read them. In thoſe daies the Gréek tong flouriſhing in Rome, brought ye
                  
of Homer in great eſtimation: whereof Adrian did take ſo great enuie, that he gaue ſtreight commaundement, that none ſhoulde reade Homer, eyther openly or ſecretly, but the workes of Anthimachus, who was a Philoſopher moſt obſcure. Adrian had condition curiouſly to inquire, of common and ſmall matters: whereof he was both noted and murmured: bicauſe, Princes being giuen to make ſearch of trifling cauſes, proue variable in prouiding for matters of importance. Alſo Adrian was of fickle diſpoſition: for that at the ſouden, he woulde determine, to perfourme ſome enterpriſe, and after growe colde, and incontinent omit the ſame: of this, as of the reſt, with great reaſon, he was noted and accuſed: bycauſe graue Princes ought to haue a repoſed deliberation, and a diligent execution. Adrian was in two things moſt extreme: that is to ſay, he vſed no meaſure or weight in his loue, or hatred: for vnto whom he did loue, he gaue all his heart: and where he did abhorre, he did imploy all his ſtrength. Admitting that this manner of loue, or hatred, is tollerable in others, yet moſt truely of vertuous Princes not permitted: bycauſe if they be vnbridled in loue, in others which they loue not, they cauſe enuie: and if they be abſolute in hatred, they ſéeke vnto them ſelues great infamie: wherefore it is conuenient in loue, to be diſcrete, and in hatred, prouident and aduiſed, He was likewiſe moſt extreme, that if he praiſed any thing, he did aduaunce it to the cloudes: and if it fell not into his fauour, he diſpraiſed it to the déepeſt bottome: in ſuch manner, that all ſayd of Adrian, that in praiſing, he was verie gracious, and in nippes, tauntes, and gyrdes, not a little malicious. Adrian had great delight in faire women, who was ſo abſolute and alſo ſo diſſolute in that vice, that he did not onely inioy virgins, perſuade married women, but alſo in the houſes of his verie friendes, he had his ſecrete loues. Of the one part, conſidering his iniuſtice, and of the other parte, the great iuſtice that he did execute: the hiſtoriographers would not place him amongeſt the pitifull Princes: neither condemne him

that were tyrannous: bycauſe moſt truly if he did chaſtice ſome by iuſtice, alſo he ſiue others by enuie.
            
            
               CHAP. III. Of the friends and enimies which Adrian had.
               
                  ADrian being of the age of ninetene yeres, Traiane conceiuing the abilitie and towardneſſe of the yong man, as well in letters as in armes, ſent to Spaine for him to come to Rome, with whome he did ſo behaue himſelfe, that for entertainment, he did receiue him into his chamber, and in his loue, did place him as a childe. The naturall bountie, and great abilitie of Adrian being in apparance, Traiane from thence foorth did ſo regard and fixe his eyes, as well to honour him, all the dayes of his life: as alſo to leaue him Emperour, after his death. Adrian being in ſo great fauour with the Emperour Traiane, there folowed thereof in proceſſe of time, no ſmall diſpleaſures to his perſon, and perils vnto his life: for his enimies by enuie, with the Emperour procured his diſgrace, and with their malice, did maligne him with the people. It is an auncient peſtilence in the courtes of Princes, that the Prince being pleaſed to beare affection, or to honour any perſon, forthwith they ioyne to murmur, &amp; procure to perſecute the ſame. As Seuerianus being huſband vnto a ſiſter of Adrian, did murmur of him vnto Traiane, ſaying yt it was a wonder vnto all men in Rome, to ſée Adrian to priuate, &amp; ſo far in fauour, &amp; that they preſumed yt after his dayes, he ſhould leaue him the Empire: vnto whome Traiane made anſwere: Who hath to ſuccéede me in the Empire? only the Gods be acquainted therewith: but admitting, that it were my will, and the Goddes permitting, that Adrian ſhoulde ſuccéede me in the Empire: I can ſay vnto thée, that to gouerne the ſame he will proue no foole, neyther a cowarde to defende it. The anſwere that Traiane made,

was very good, and yet not without a ſecret taunt, for that the Conſul Seuerianus, had neyther praiſed him for valiaunt, eyther held him for wiſe. This Seuerianus was alwaies a great enimie of Adrian, &amp; did not ceaſe trauelling to diſgrace him with the Emperour: wherby Adrian hapned at times, to be both in fauour, and diſfauour: in ſuche manner, that Adrian burned betwixt two fiers, whiche is to wit, eare to reſiſt his enimies, and ſolicitude in conſeruing his frends. The firſt office that Adrian had in Rome, Traiane being Conſul, and Domitian being emperour, he was made a Decem viriato: that is to ſay, he was appointed for one of the ten men, that were deputed, to determin contentions amongſt the people. Adrian gaue ſo good account of his office, and recouered in Rome ſo good fame, that he ſéemed ſufficient vnto al men, alone and in his own perſon, to gouerne a common wealth: and ſo it came to paſſe, that in the yeare folowing, he was deputed Tribune of the ſecond legion: that is to ſay, that he had charge to gouerne and correct the ſeconde capteinſhip, of the armies
that were in the wars: bycauſe it was a cuſtome in Rome, that euerie capteinſhip ſhould haue a capteine to fight: and a Tribune to rule and gouerne.
The yeare of the tribune office being paſt, he was ſent vnto the inferiour Miſia, gouerning that Prouince with ſo great prudence, and was of ſuche readineſſe and ſkill amongeſt thoſe Barbarians, that ſome delighted to obey him, &amp; the others durſt not reſiſt him. Adrian was in no ſmall perplexitie, for the doubt he had to be remoued from Traianes fauour, which he ſuſpected, to ſée him ſelfe in Miſia, &amp; his enimie Seuerianus with Traiane in Rome: that vppon any report that might be made of him there, ye malice of his enimie had place to aggrauate, and he for him ſelfe being farre diſtant, not able to anſwere. Traiane had in his chamber one whome he much fauoured, named Gallus, a moſt ſpeciall friend vnto Adrian: and Adrian being aduertiſed, that Gallus his moſt faithfull friende was deade, made for him great obſequies, and wept for him many teares. There ſuccéeded in

fauour vnto this Gallus another named Surus, a man ſufficiently wiſe and prudent: and alſo this, as Gallus, was moſt ſpecial friend vnto Adrian: and the very cauſe wherby he obteined the fauoured to be his friends, was: for that in his giftes he was very liberall: and to doe for his friend, no leſſe determined.
Alſo Adrian gaue him ſelf to content, ſerue, and pleaſe Plotina, Traianes wife, and vſed therein ſo great ſkill, and came ſo farre into fauour with Plotina, that out of that ſo narrowe friendſhip, he gathered more profit, then ſhe did honour. Traiane had in his houſe a néece named Sabina, whiche was to marrie, and requeſted for wife, of many noble Romaines: but Plotina and Surus trauelled and perſuaded Traiane to marrie her vnto Adrian: affirming that with this marriage, he was excuſed of two marriages, that is to ſay: to ſéeke a wife for Adrian, and an huſband for Sabina.
                  
When as Adrian had preſented many giftes, and offered many ſeruices vnto Plotina: partely for the great loue that ſhe did beare him, and for that ſhe had married him vnto Sabina, ſhe made him anſwere: Adrian, according to the good will which I beare thée, it is ſmal which I haue done for thée, in reſpect of that which I meane to doe: for that I may doe little with my Lord Traiane, but as he hath choſen thée to be his nephew, he ſhall alſo adopt thée to be his ſonne. After Adrian had obteined Plotina for his good Ladie, Sabina for his wife, and Surus for his friend, he little eſtéemed the enimitie of Seuerianus his enimie: bycauſe in Traianes houſe, all did honour him as one in fauour, &amp; did ſerue him as a maiſter.
            
            
               CHAP. IIII. Of the loue that the Emperour Traiane had vnto Adrian.
               BY the marriage that Adrian had with Sabina, néece vnto the Emperour Traiane, there followed him, not a litle, but very much profite: for, beſides that he was moſt

in fauour with the Emperour, and verie well liked of the Empreſſe Plotina, the greateſt parte of the affaires of the Empire, was diſpatcht by his handes. Adrian preſuming of great eloquence, preſented vppon a day before the Senate, a certaine paſtorall enterlude, whereat the Senatours and Oratours did greatly laugh: not onely of that whiche he ſayde, but alſo of the baſe ſtyle wherein he did
ſpeake the ſame. He gaue him ſelfe to the Latine toung, and to the Art of an Oratour, wherin he grew ſo profound, yt they gaue to him as great glory for his ſpeache, as vnto Cicero for his writing.
In the firſt warres that Traiane had with the Datians, Adrian was made Queſtor, that is to ſay, he had charge to prouide, victuals and furniture for the campe: whiche was an office amongeſt the armies, of great honour, and of much confidence: for he had both the treaſure in his cuſtodie, and the payment of the campe. When Traiane was eyther ſicke, or not at leaſure, on his behalfe Adrian went to the Senate: but the Senators although they did admit him to ſpeake, they did not permit
him to excéede or to take the chiefe place: for it was a lawe amongeſt them much vſed, that being aſſembled in the Senate, none ſhould preſume to clap his handes, to cauſe ſilence, or cōmaūd the doore to be ſhut, neyther enter being clad with a long gowne, or to place him ſelfe in the higheſt ſeate, but onely the Emperour.
Being notorious vnto all men, that Adrian was priuate with the Emperour Traiane, and in great fauour with Plotina his wife, and therewithall, that he was a man both prudent and politique: and although in the Senate not permitted to the chiefeſt place, yet all things were directed by his counſell, in ſuche wiſe, that at home all things were done as he thought good, and abroade as he did commaund. When it was knowne in Rome, that the king of Datia eftſoones had rebelled, Adrian preſently perſuaded Traiane, in his owne perſon to go to that war, and to leaue the enterpriſe to no other man: wherein Adrian did followe and ſerue Traiane, more then any other capteine: and certainly did there

ſo valiaunt and notable déedes, that with Traiane he obteined fauour, and aduaunced his perſon to great eſtimation. Adrian being thus notified in the warres of Datia, Traiane thought it méete to commende vnto him the ſeconde legion, which was vnder the protection of the Goddeſſe Minerua: and in ſuch manner did gouerne the ſame, and gaue his ſouldiers ſo great courage, that he was the man, that did moſt grieue the enimie, and leaſt did feare perilles.
The thing moſte eſtéemed of the Emperour Traiane, was a Diamond which Nerua had giuen him: this Diamond Traiane gaue Adrian, in the time of the warres of Datia, which was ſo kept and eſtéemed of Adrian, that vntill the day of his death, it was neuer ſéene off from his finger.
The warres of Datia being finiſhed, Traiane returned to Rome, leauing Adrian as Pretour of that Prouince, Suſſurus and Seuerianus being conſuls. He had not long gouerned Datia, when Adrian receiued from the Senate newe prouiſion to paſſe into Panonia: where he was not only gouernour in cauſes of iuſtice, but alſo had charge of all martiall affaires: bycauſe certaine barbarous Danubians had entered thoſe Prouinces, ſacking and ſpoyling greate countries. Adrian being arriued into Panonia, did in ſhort time expell the enimies, viſited the countries, refourmed the armies, chaſticed the Romaine officers: and founde by infourmation, that they were great friendes of idleneſſe, and no enimies of robberie. The fame being come to Rome, of the commendable gouernement of Adrian in Panonia: in the yeare following, in the Kalends of Ianuarie, the Senate did elect him Conſul: and truely, as they were many, that did alowe this election, ſo they were not few that did reſiſt it: but in fine, the procurers had more force in their diligence, then the malice of them which reſiſted.
            
            
               
               CHAP. V. Of the care and ſolicitude of Adrian, to obteine the Empire.
               IN all Kingdomes and Prouinces, where Adrian was eyther Pretour or Queſtour, preſently he made diligent inquiſition, if there were any Magicians of Soothſayers: and if he founde any he did perſuade them, with ſwéete wordes, and riche rewardes, to be certified, if after the death of Traiane, the Empire ſhould come vnto his handes: for that he was not onely deſirous to obteine the ſame, but carefull to know the iſſue thereof. Being reſident in the Prouince of Meſia, he was aduertiſed by a Mathematike, that he ſhould be Emperour: and demaunding howe and by what meanes, he vnderſtoode thereof, anſwered: by a certaine friend which was not onely learned in the naturall courſes, but alſo did vnderſtande the ſecretes of the immortall Gods. Although Adrian was reſident in ſtraunge Prouinces, he was not ſlacke to ſerue the Empreſſe Plotina, and to pleaſe the chamberleine Surus: in ſuch wiſe, that if his enimies did thinke him farre off, they found his ſeruice, alwayes ready and at hande. Nowe when Traiane was ſtricken in age, and become ſickly, Adrian continued no leſſe diligent, to ſolicite Plotina and Surus, to perſuade the Emperour, to adopt him for his ſonne: but on the other ſide the Conſul Seuerianus, Palma and Celſus, and other his enimies, did withſtande: whoſe diligence and malice did little profite, bycauſe they did but diſcouer their intent, and coulde not obteine their deſire. Eyther by the onely will of Traiane, or by the importunitie of Plotina, nor by the ſuite of Surus, eyther by the merite of his owne perſon, the Emperour Traiane determined to thoſe Elius Adrian to be his ſonne, after his dayes to ſuccéede him in the Empire: for the Emperour had many kingdomes to giue, but no ſonne to whome he might leaue the ſame.
               Before Traiane had elected Adrian, he was long determined, to make no aſſignment of any perſon, to ſuccéed him

in the Empire, but to haue vſed the order of Alexander the great: who being demaunded, whome he woulde aſſigne to ſuccéede him in his Monarchie, anſwered, Vnto the moſt worthy. Traiane made a memoriall, of all the moſt vertuous, wiſe, and of moſt worthineſſe within the Empire: and ioyntly therewith, cauſed to be written of them, ſeuerall Orations, in Gréeke and Latine: and he him ſelfe did adde with his owne hande, what he thought agréeable to their conditions and abilities. To the ende that after his dayes, the Senate might open and reade the ſame, and from thence to make election: not of him that did moſt procure, but that did beſt deſerue. At one time a certaine Conſul, named Neratius Priſcus, was greatly in his fauour, vnto whom he had thought to haue left ye Empire, in ſo much, ye one day Traiane ſaid vnto him: Neratius Priſcus, from hencefoorth I comend ye Empire vnto thée, if any ſorrowfull or ſouden deſtinie ſhall happen vnto me. All ſuch as did withſtande the adoption of Adrian, did fauour the election of Neratius Priſcus: but Fortune that ſhould haue framed the effect, brought Neratius into Traianes great hatred, not a little to the profite of Adrian: bycauſe from thence foorth, although their remained enimies to hinder his intent, none as an oppoſite, durſt demaunde the ſame. When Traiane paſſed from Spaine into Aſia, to the wars of the Parthians, Plotina and Surus, made great ſuite that Adrian might be ſente, as Pretour into Syria: whoe being in Antioche, was aduertiſed by a meſſinger from Traiane, which in times paſt had bene his tutor, how he was elected to be Traianes ſonne, and aſſigned his ſucceſſour in the Empire. Excéeding was the ioy that Adrian receiued with that newes, which he did vtter in ſuch exceſſiue manner and degrée, that preſently he did celebrate, with great games and feaſtes, the day of his natiuitie: and not only vpon that day, but euery yeare, all the dayes of his life: bicauſe it was the thing, that his heart moſt deſired, and for the attainement whereof, he had imployed his greateſt ſkill and ſtrength.
               
                  At that time were Conſuls, Soſius and Pretorius, with whome Adrian entered newe friendſhippe: and the ende wherefore he did vndertake this newe affection, was, that as Plotina &amp; Surus did ſolicite &amp; procure the Empire with Traiane, ſo thoſe two Conſuls ſhuld ſubſiſt him in the Senate: in ſuch wiſe, that if he did watch to obtaine it, he did ouerwatch to ſuſtaine it. Not long after that Adrian was adopted, that is to ſay, after fourtéene monethes, Traiane dyed: preſently Plotina his wife, and the Conſul Tatianus, being chiefe friendes vnto Adrian, did take order and vſe great diligence, that Adrians admiſſion vnto the Empire, might firſt be notified and knowne in Rome, before the death of the Emperour Traiane: whiche was concealed and couered for certaine dayes, ſaying, that he was ſo ſicke, that he would not be viſited, vntill they were poſſeſt of the power of the armies, and had obteined the good will of the Senate. Adrian did write vnto the Senatours, giuing them to vnderſtand, that Traiane was at the point of death, and that alſo he was aſſigned and adopted to be his ſucceſſour and heire in the Empire: and did right inſtantly requeſt them, to take the ſame in good parte, and therevppon did promiſe, and ſweare vnto them, to diuide or giue offices, but at their owne liking and conſent.
            
            
               CHAP. VI. Howe at Traianes death Adrian was declared Emperour.
               THe newes of Traianes death being arriued at Rome, preſently it was publiſhed, that the ſucceſſion of the empire was cōmitted vnto Adrian: &amp; vpon the confirmation, or refuſal of this election, there aroſe no ſmal contention in the Senate: and the matter ſo far argued &amp; proſecuted,

by his friendes, and ſo reſiſted by his enimies: that it gaue no ſmall doubt of inteſtine warrs, no leſſe cruell, then the warres betwixt Caeſar and Pompey. The ſeruaunts of Traiane, the friends of Plotina, and the kinred and alies of Tatian, did vſe ſuche diligence in this caſe, that within thrée dayes they confirmed Adrian, in the Empire: and the greateſt cauſe to moue the Senate therevnto, was: that they had intelligence, that Adrian was in Syria, in full power, poſſeſſion, and authoritie, of the whole armie: and might haue bene conſtrained to yealde by force, which they refuſed to perfourme by good will. Preſently after Adrian was confirmed in the Empire, he did write vnto the Senate, gratifying their friendly fact, and requeſting that Traiane might be collocate amongſt the Gods, ſince he had bene a Prince ſo diuine, whereto the Senate gladly conſented, ſaying: that although Traiane had finiſhed his life, for euermore in Rome his fame ſhoulde indure. In memorie yt 
                  Traiane had ouercome the Parthians, they ordeined yt euery yeare the Parthik playes ſhould be celebrated in Rome, which indured amongſt the Romains many yeres: but in fine, they and their playes had an end.
Before all thinges, Adrian gaue order, that the body of Traiane might be brought into Italie, where it ſhoulde be giuen a generous ſepulchre, and to effectuate the ſame, commanded his aſhes to be incloſed in a boxe of Vnicorne, which alſo was incloſed with golde, and placed in a piller of moſt excellent marble, lyned with moſt rich purple: all which being ladē into a gallie, he ſent Tatian and Plotina, wt the body vnto Rome: al Rome went foorth to receiue ye body of Traiane: and as it is ſayd and written, there was neuer ſo muche ioy vttered for any man, that entered being aliue: but muche more ſorrowe was diſcouered, for Traianes comming deade. Adrian ſtayed in Antioche, whiche is the heade of Syria, partly to aſſemble the whole armie, and partly to recouer money: for being then winter, he could neyther campe for coldeneſſe of the weather: eyther marche or iourney for want of money.
               
               
                  
                  Adrian was there aduertiſed, howe the Mauritans did defie him, the Sarmatians did mutinate, the Britans did rebell, the Paleſtines reſiſt, the Aegyptians diſobey, and that all the Barbarians were in commotion. Finally, it is to be vnderſtoode, that vpon the death of Traiane, al people and nations were ſo eſcandalized, that it ſéemed not, but that he left the world without a maiſter or an owner. Adrian perceiuing the greater part of the Empire in commotion, determined to make them no war, but to intreate them by peace: and for this cauſe he refuſed and forſooke al thoſe kingdomes and Prouinces, that lay beyond the riuer Euphrates, and the riuer Tygris, which the good Traiane had wonne and conquered: in which conqueſt he imployed his noble perſon, and gaue ende vnto his honourable life. Vnto all kingdomes and Prouinces, Adrian ſent Embaſſadours, to confederate with ſome, and to confirme peace with others: and with ſome he did capitulate thinges ſo ſlaunderous, and with ſo great diſaduauntage: that it had bene much better to haue rayſed warre, then to haue procured a peace ſo infamous. Parſnapate king of the Parthians, came to complaine vnto Adrian, ſaying, that the good Traiane had giuen him that kingdome, and crowned him with his owne hands, and now vpon the death of Traiane, they would neyther obey him, or ſuffer him to liue within the kingdome. Adrian would not, or elſe durſt not, make warres with the Parthians: but gaue vnto Parſnapate, the Seigniorie of certaine countries and Prouinces of Syria, being vacant at that time, as Lorde to inioy the fruites thereof, and as Romaine Pretour to gouerne the people.
When Adrian had obteined the Empire, preſently he publiſhed and ſayd vnto all men, that he wold become a pitifull Prince: and truly, in ſome pitifull cauſes, he did ſhew him ſelfe to be the ſonne of Traiane: but in ſome rigorous matters, he ſéemed to be the brother of Nero.
                  
A certaine man named Bebius, was Prefect in Rome, who was contrarie vnto Adrian, in all thinges that eyther touched his honour or profite: and being counſelled to kill Bebius, for

that he ceaſed not to be his aduerſarie, made anſwere: I will not onely permit Bebius to liue, but alſo the office of Pretour, which hee helde but for a yeare, I will confirme vnto him during his life. Laberius and Frugius, two Romaine Senatours, were baniſhed vnto the Iſle of Pontus, whom he commaunded to returne to their houſes, and their goodes to be reſtored them: but the Conſul Frugius being mutinous, mouing commotion betwixt Adrian and the Senate, he commaunded to be throwne aliue into Tyber: and obteined no leſſe honour, in the executing of the one, then in pardoning the other. Vnto certaine Gentlemen of the armie, that ſayde vnto Adrian in times paſt, that he ſhould be Emperour, he gaue double rewardes: affirming, that he gaue them not for their aduertiſement, but for their good will.
            
            
               CHAP. VII. Of his entrie into Rome.
               NOwe when Summer was come, Adrian parted from Antioche to come to Rome: and lefte for Prepoſite of Syria, Catalius Seuerus, and tooke his way throughe Illyria, and determined to make warre with the Sarmatians, which would not receiue the Ambaſſadours of peace. Lucius Turbon, that had béene Pretour tenne yeares in Mauritania, came foorth to méete him vpon the waye, with whome Adrian had great friendſhip, being a young man, and in houſe with his Lorde Traiane: preſently he made him Pretour of the Prouince of Datia, and Panonia. At that time Lucius Turbon was in Africa, maiſter of the horſſe men, of whome Adrian was aduertiſed, that he was verie riche, and in greate power throughout the kingdome, and that he had not obteined all that riches, in the time of warre, but by briberie in time of peace.
               
                  
                  Adrian was not a little grieued, of that which was ſayde by Lucius Turbone, bycauſe he was his friende, and alſo ſeruaunt vnto Traiane: but all this notwithſtanding, he applyed all that he had, vnto the common treaſure, and diſarmed him of his knighthoode. As muche as Adrian did increaſe in potencie, ſo much did his enimies increaſe in enuie: in ſuche manner, that they coulde neyther incline their harts to loue him, eyther yeald their ſtrēgth to ſerue
him. The caſe was thus, that Palma, Celſus, Sobaius, and Lucius, Adrian going on hunting, were determined in the middeſt of the chace, to rid him of his life: wherevpon they were agréed, that in his ſwifteſt purſuit of any wild beaſt, they would attend him in the moſt thickeſt pace or track: &amp; there vnder the colour to miſſe their leuell at the beaſt, would ſhoote and kill the Emperour. All theſe foure were men of noble bloud, and rich in goods, and were called Cō
                        ſulares: bycauſe at other times they had bene Conſuls: but as their treaſon was diſcouered, firſt by iuſtice they were beheaded, before Adrian went on hunting.
Great was the murmuring and mutinie throughout all Rome, when they vnderſtoode howe Adrian had executed ſo cruell iuſtice, vpon theſe foure Conſulares or noble men: partly for that they helde opinion, that Adrian had raiſed that quarell againſte them: and partly for cuſtome and manner, for that fewe were the chaſtiſements, whiche the good Traiane did execute, but great was the number that receiued pardon. Adrian being aduertiſed, that for the death of the foure Conſulares, all Rome was eſcandalized, and that for a man reuenging and cruell, his perſon was defamed, determined with all ſpéede to come to Rome, to excuſe him ſelfe of that fault. The affaires of Adrian ſtood not in ſo euill eſtate, as vpon the way, they gaue him aduertiſement: which did well appeare, in that the Senate did offer him the triumph due vnto Traiane, being cut off by death to inioy the ſame: but Adrian refuſing, gaue order, that the Image of Traiane ſhoulde be placed in the triumphant chariote: to the ende that good Traiane
                  
ſhoulde not want a triumphe, although but after his death. Preſently when Adrian came to Rome, he went to viſite the Sepulchre of his Lorde Traiane, where his eyes did ſhed many teares, and for him did offer vnto the Gods moſt ſumptuous ſacrifices. All the Senate being ioyned, and alſo all the moſt principal of the people, vnto whome Adrian made a long oration: wherin he gaue them to vnderſtand of the ſtate of the Empire: and did excuſe him ſelfe of the death of the aforeſaide foure Conſulares: becauſe the officers of the Senate had made ſearche and inquiſition of the cauſe, and the Pretors of ye armies did execute the ſentence. The Senate did offer Adrian the title of Pater patriae, but he would not receiue it, affirming it to be one of the titles of his lord Traiane: and ſince he had been a good father, it were great reaſon he ſhould proue a good ſonne. It was a cuſtome in Rome and throughout all Italie, that when their Princes came newely to gouerne the Empire, that all cities and other people ſhould furniſhe him with a certeine ſumme of golde and ſiluer: with the golde to make a crowne, and the ſiluer for the ſeruice of his houſe: and ſometimes they did preſent ſo much golde to make the crowne, that the remnant was ſufficient to mainteine the warres. Adrian refuſed not onely this ſeruice to be demaunded, but alſo returned that which was brought him: ſaying, that his crowne ſhould be riche, when his ſubiectes ſhould be in wealth. The officers of the treaſurie, that is to ſaye, ſuche as had the collection and kéeping of the maſſe of Rome, had raiſed greate rentes, daily inuenting newe manner of tributes, in the common wealth: which being knowen vnto Adrian, he commaunded all newe impoſitions to be remoued from the common wealth, and the inuentors thereof to be diſplaced from their offices. Generally the Romains complained vnto Adrian of the dearth of victuals: foorthwith he prouided for prouiſion of wheat from Sicyl, wines from Candie, and oyle from Spaine: and further, gaue ſuch prices vnto the ſame, and all other victuals, that the poore

might féede with the riche. He did promiſe and ſweare in the Senate to put no Senatour vnto death, although he were culpable, without the accuſed ſhould firſt be heard, and his cauſe conſidered by all the Senate: and truely this othe did excuſe Adrian of many executions, and was no leſſe occaſion that the Senatours committed many faultes. Princes haue to conſider what they ſweare and promiſe: for, from that day wherein Princes ſhal vnable thē ſelues, to puniſhe vice and ſinne, from thenceforth their vaſſals ſhal followe wickedneſſe. In the yere that Adrian entred Rome, all thinges were deare, and the people not ſounde or in health: who vſing greate magnificence, commaunded much money to be giuen to the poore of the common wealth: in ſuch wiſe, that it was not founde that any died for hunger, either ſuffered any extreme neceſſitie.
               There were many that had béene baniſhed, and diuerſe in priſon for debt due vnto the Fiſcall: that is to ſaye, vnto his chamber. Adrian gaue commaundement by publique proclamation, that all ſuch debtes ſhould be abſolued, and that for any ſuch debte, none ſhould be runnagates, either kept in priſon. Adrian did derogate the law &amp; cuſtome of his predeceſſours, which is to wéet, that ye goods of the condemned, ſhould be for the Prince, which he commaunded from thenceforth to be imployed not to his chā
                  ber, but to the comfort of the common wealth: for he ſaide and helde opinion, that the Iudge ſhould neuer be grieued, to puniſhe offendours, when he ſhould remember, to inherite a ſhare of the offendours goods. He extremely delighted when any perſon came to craue, and much more did reioyce, if he had to giue: but if by chaunce he had not to ſatiſfie his demaund, at the leaſt he gaue him a friendly aunſwer. From the time that Adrian was in poſſeſſion of ye Empire: he was neuer heard to ſay, or name, Traiane: but, my Lord Traiane.
               
            
            
               CHAP. VIII. ¶Of the good conditions and inclinations of Adrian.
               
                  WIth much diligence and no leſſe ſecrecie, Adrian inquired, what life the Senatours did leade, and what exerciſe they vſed: and ſuch as he found poore and vertuous, he augmented their patrimonie: and ſuch as he found riche and vicious, he found meane to depriue them from ye Senate.

                     Adrian was a Prince, verie ſkilfull, and muche conſiderate in puniſhing his officers and ſeruauntes, that is to ſaye: he kept ſecrete from the people the cauſes why he remoued any perſon from his office. And further, if he diſplaced any perſon from his commoditie, he did not forget otherwiſe to recompence him, in ſuch maner, that if he did chaſtice them, he did not diſhonor them. Many times, did Adrian ſpeake theſe woordes: Whome I ſhal ſee eſteemed and worſhipped in the common wealth, I wil rather determin to take away his hed then his honour.
                  
The rēts which the good Traiane left in many partes of Italie, for ye bréeding of children, the ſuſtaining of widowes, &amp; the marriage of Orphans, he did not only confirme, but alſo made better. All the ſeruants of Traiane he did aduaunce to better offices: &amp; ſuch as were not méete for offices, he gaue thē money. Adrian commaunded ſerch to be made, how many noble men were falne into pouertie: &amp; ſuch as were decayed by miſchaunce, he relieued: &amp; ſuch as procured pouertie by vice, he gaue them leaue to endure neceſſitie. He gaue help to al ye 
                  Romaine widowes to marrie their daughters, &amp; he was not more boūtiful in giuing relief vnto ye daughters, then he was an enimie to ſuccour the ſonnes: for he helde opinion, that, that young man deſerued not to be married, that with his handes did not obteine a marriage. By thrée dayes ſpace, he did celebrate the feaſt of the god Genius: that is to ſaye, the daye of his birthe: and commaūded vpon thoſe dayes, to giue pitances vnto all ye people, and he with all the Senatours and nobles did eate and banquet in his imperiall palace: the coſt whereof did not amount vnto ſo little, but as they were thrée, if they had béene ſixe, the rentes of the whole Empire had béen ſpent, and parte of their treaſure.
               
                  By the ſpace of ſixe continuall dayes he did cauſe them to repreſent the game of ſwoorde players: and the people craued certeine other playes, which he would not conſent: not for that he delighted not therein, but to giue them to vnderſtand in Rome, that it appertained vnto Princes, as much to moderate their pleaſures, as to giue order for thinges of importance. Before Adrian was Emperour, he was thriſe Conſul, for which cauſe he made diuers Romaines thrée times Conſuls: and whereas ſome were offended, for want of like fauour, he did aunſwer: Such as did exceede mee in merite, ought to be equall with mee
                  in dignitie. 
                  Within the compaſſe of Rome, neuer before the dayes of Adrian, were permitted more then two Conſuls: the one to gouerne the common wealth, the other to go to the warres: but Adrian did adde and create a thirde Conſul: for that if ye one ſhould be ſicke, and the other reſident in the warres, the common wealth ſhoulde not remaine without an head.
                  Tutinus a noble knight of Rome, Adrian did create Senatour, and gaue him the enſignes of Conſul, whereat the whole Senate was offended: affirming, that the Emperour ought or might not create in ſuch manner: partely, becauſe Tutinus was not of deſeruing, and partly, for that the aduiſe of the Senate ſhould haue béene vſed therein. Adrian was diſpleaſed with theſe wordes of the Romaines, and from thence foorth did vſe more libertie in reparting offices, and leſſe companye in determining cauſes. He helde Seuerianus in greate veneration, which had married his ſiſter, vnto whome he gaue both honour and great rewardes: and at all times, when Seuerianus came vnto his chamber to conferre, and to vnderſtand his pleaſure, Adrian came foorth to méete and receiue him at the doore. Although Seuerianus came to viſite Adrian, and Adrian came foorth to receiue Seuerianus, yet auncient and very mortall was the hatred betwixt them: for in this caſe, either of them did vtter and diſcouer, to be poſſeſſed with a moſte vile intent: for that Seuerianus did trauaile to depriue Adrian from Empire

and honour, and Adrian with no leſſe facilitie did take away his life. When Adrian was in Rome, at the leaſt he went thriſe a wéeke vnto the Senate: and if he were either ſicke, or muche buſied, they did repaire vnto his preſence: in ſuch maner, that nothing of importance did paſſe in the Senate, wherein they did not vſe his iudgement. Adrian, was of familiar conuerſation with his ſpeciall friendes, and with his particular ſeruaunts, with whome he went to eate in their gardeines, to fiſhe at riuers, to hunt in the fieldes, and all other ſuch like paſtimes. Naturally he was giuen to haue compaſſion of the ſicke, and herein he did neither conſider whether they were friends or foes: for that indifferently he did viſite them, and at his owne charges did prouide for them. He did not onely viſite the ſicke, but alſo the olde men, decrepite with age: of whome at large he woulde inquire of the yeres that they had liued, the kingdomes they had trauelled, the daungers they had paſſed, the enimies which they had helde, &amp; the neceſſities that they had endured, in ſuche wiſe, that many times, of the things which they had ſaide, of times paſt, he tooke example for the time preſent. Adrian was a moſt ſingular friende of vertuous men, and wiſe Philoſophers, and neuer wanted their companie, either in warre or peace: becauſe of the vertuous he learned how to liue, and of the Philoſophers howe to gouerne.
               
               
                  Turbone, maiſter of the horſe men had a ſonne with Adrian, ſufficiently valiant, and with Adrian very priuate: but ioyntly wt this, he held him for preſumptuous in ſpéech, and couetous in dealings, becauſe all which Adrian did at his requeſt and ſuite, he ſolde it all for money: the truthe of this caſe being knowen, Adrian receiued therof ſo great diſpleaſure, that preſently he commaunded the young man to be apprehended, and that all things which by briberie he had purloined ſhoulde be taken from him, and reſtored vnto the owners, and to be tranſported as a baniſhed man to the Iſle of Pontus: vnto whome Adrian ſaide, of this offence, thou ſhalt remaine chaſticed, and I

warned for euer more, to ſhewe ouermuch and extreme fauour vnto my ſeruaunt, whereby to conuert loue into pride, or to ſell fauour for couetiſe.
            
            
               CHAP. IX. ¶Of the maner which Adrian vſed with the men of warre.
               WHen Adrian parted from Almaine to come to Rome, not as then determined to haue ſtayed long there: but the occaſion of his ſtaye, was, for that the good Traiane, in his latter yeres, was deteined ſo long time in the warres of Aſia, &amp; Europa, that the cōmon wealthes of Italie were growen to greate and ouermuch libertie. Adrian departing from Rome, came ſtreight vnto Gallia Tranſalpina: not to conquer but to viſite the ſame. The frenchemen did much reioyce at his cōming, and in euery prouince did him great ſeruice, becauſe Adrian was the firſt Romaine Prince that euer entred Fraunce in peace, for that all his predeceſſours brake in by violent hoſtilitie. Perſonally viſiting all Gallia, wherein he did erect newe buildinges, repaired the olde, reedified temples, reformed prieſtes, ſet at libertie certeine gentlemen, gaue giftes vnto the people, pardoned ſome offences, and puniſhed others: finally all his déedes, were gratefull vnto the citizens, &amp; profitable vnto the common wealth. The affaires of Fraunce being ſet in order, once more he returned to paſſe ye 
                  Alps, and tooke his way into Almaine, without any diſpoſition to make warre, but to procure peace: for that Adrian naturally was giuen friendly with all men to haue peace, whiche if they would not accept, he was not after eaſie to intreate.
               In the time that Adrian had moſt peace, then did he exerciſe his men of warre, as if he had béene amongeſt his enimies: and for this cauſe he helde opinion, that al Princes did craue his peace, for that he was neuer vnreadie to

make warre. Adrian inuented many deuiſes, wherin his knightes might exerciſe their ſtrength, as wagers to runne, towers, and fortes of wood, and earth, to aſſault, marche tenne againſt tenne in combat: he ſought out ſtrong places to practiſe the arte of mining, prouoked them to go to wraſtling, and brought them to riuers to learne to ſwim: finally, he held them ſo occupied, that they deſired rather to fight an whole day in earneſt, then ſo many dayes in ieſt. Alſo Adrian did vſe to féede of the common victuals of the camp, that is to ſaye, groſe baken, rat eaten chéeſe, powdred béefe, and barley bread: and if any thinge were dreſt for his owne perſon, more delicate then ye reſt, he made ſuche diuiſion, that the leaſt parte came to him ſelfe. What more or leſſe, he alwayes did weare ſome armour: and if by chaunce he found any gentleman vnarmed, preſently he was checked of his wages: affirming, that the man that goeth vnarmed, ought not to be intreated and honoured as a gentlemā. In the armies, amongſt the greater or leſſe, better or woorſe, their worke or exerciſe was equally diuided: whiche is to wéete, when the time was to drawe, all did hale and drawe: and when the time was to dig, all without exception at their turne, did dig and mine: at the time of watching in their courſe, euery man did watche: in theſe trauels he did no more excuſe him ſelfe then others: for at his turne, he did both watche and dig in the mine with his owne handes. He had not, neither conſented in the warres, the vſe of high tables to féede on, either portals to paſſe the time, neither canes to coole or recreate, either warmed water to bathe, neither cookerie or dreſſing of meate, either ſelling of ſwéete oyntments: for he helde opinion, that the good and valiant ſouldiers, did not annoynt them ſelues, but with the blood of enimies. Adrians garments were not curious or coſtlye, but very cleanly, whereunto he was addicted, both in diet, and apparell: and after a maner he did abhorre ſuche men as were not nete and fine: affirming, that filthie men be alwayes of drouſie iudgements.
               
                  In the warres he did neuer weare ſilk, purple, or riche veſture, either buttons, or agglets of golde, or his dagger, ſwoorde, or armour gilte: but notwithſtanding verye fine and ſtrong. When any was notified in the warres, of valiant and doubtie déedes, preſently he did notifie him, with great and bountifull rewardes: in ſuch manner, that he did not deferre to recompence at Rome any ſeruice don in the warres. When he trauailed through mountaines, moſt times he did alight to bring other men on foote, and did marche xv. or xx. miles in his armour: and this he did, to kéepe their horſes freſhe and luſty, if they ſhould hap to encounter with the enimie. He did alwayes lodg within the campe, and ordinarily he went from tent to tent, to viſite the wounded, and with the whole and ſound to haue conuerſation. Adrian was ſo familiar with his men of warre, that he called verie many by their names, and knew all men by their geſture: in ſuch wiſe, that no enimie or ſtraunger, might enter his campe that to him was vnknowen. When a horſemans rome was vacant in the warres, the captaines ſought out ſuch as ſhould ſuccéede: but Adrian in his owne perſon would examine him, and this he did, to knowe his face, and try his ſtrength. Such as he did elect tribunes, or captaines of his armies, were verie valiant, but not couetous: and ioyntly therewith, he admitted not young men without beardes, either olde men brokē or decayed: doubting, in too much youth, want of gouernement: and in too much age, ſtrength to fight. He made good paye vnto his men of warre, ſtreightly forbidding his captaines to imbezill any wages, or to take awaye preſent giuing vnto the ſouldiers: and this Adrian did, to auoide neceſſitie in the one, and couetiſe in the other. He did prohibite by a publique lawe, that none ſhould carrie vnto the warres any ſuperfluous thing, and that none ſhould preſume to buy or ſell any thing that was not neceſſarie. Very diligent to furniſhe his camps with victuals, which being brought vnto the campe, he did ſo priſe them, that the buyer was not robbed, either the

ſeller defrauded. Imitating Vegetius, Adrian did write a booke, wherein he did inſtruct the captaines, howe they ſhould fight: and an order, how tribunes ſhoulde gouerne the armies: to conformitie whereof he made many excellent lawes, which for long time were obſerued of the Romaine Princes. In this caſe, of order, prouiſion, and correction of the men of warre, they were onely thrée Princes that attained vnto the chiefe perfection thereof: that is to ſaye, Auguſtus, Traiane, and Adrian, becauſe all other Princes, helde men of warre not to defend, but to diſſipate the common wealth.
            
            
               CHAP. X. ¶Of the actes that Adrian did in Englande, Fraunce, and Spaine.
               
                  ALl the time that Adrian was in Almaine, he did moſte occupie him ſelfe in reforming his men of warre into good cuſtomes and order, which he did not without greate prudence, after the manner of a good mariner, whiche in time, when the Sea is calme, doeth dreſſe and mende his failes, &amp; order his anchors againſt the ſtorme and ſoudein chaunces that may followe in time to come.
               
               From Almaine, Adrian came vnto greate Britaine, whiche is nowe called England, and there founde peace, as in Fraunce, which was then holden for a greate maruaile: becauſe from the time of Iulius Caeſar, whiche did firſt conquer the ſame, vnto the dayes of Adrian, they were neuer without warres with the Frenche men, or rebelling againſt the Romaines.
                  Preſently vppon his entrie into Britaine, he ſought curiouſly to be informed of the lawes they helde, and of the cuſtomes they vſed: which being peruſed and examined, ſome he did allowe, and ſome he did remoue and make fruſtrate: eſpecially, he did adnihilate that lawe, whereby the man ſhould holde ii. wiues, and the woman .vii. huſbandes. When Iulius Caeſar did

conquer the Ilande of England, he brought many people out of Italie to inhabite that countrie: and although the natiue, with the ſtraunger, helde no warre, yet liued they not in perfect peace: for the Britans did terme ye 
                     Romaines newe come men, and the Romaines did call them Barbarians.
                  
                  Adrian finding that no friendſhip might be framed by prayer, or amendment by correction, deuiſed to diuide the kingdome in the middeſt: and the caſe was thus: that in the middes of the kingdome, he made a wall from Sea to Sea, a worke moſt ſtraunge, wherein this Prince did imploy great treaſure. Adrian being reſident in Britaine, was aduertiſed from Rome of the want of good gouernement that was vſed in his wiues houſe, by the occaſion of certeine Romaines, which aduentured to accompany the Empreſſe: whoſe conuerſation was more to the preiudice of his fame, then to the profite of his ſeruice. Septicius Prefectus, and Sortonius Tranquillus, which at that time were Secretaries vnto the Senate: theſe &amp; others grewe very familiar with the Empreſſe Sabina: whome Adrian ſent commaundement to be depriued of their offices, and to be baniſhed Rome, Sabina, Adrians wife, was holden to be franke of ſpeache, and of life ſomewhat licentious. Adrian did greatly abhorre to haue Sabina vnto his wife: and would ſaye, not in ſecrete, but openly, that if he were a common perſon, he would haue béene diuorced, for that in her conuerſation ſhée was preſumptuous, &amp; in life
looſe &amp; diſſolute. 
                     Adrian was much inclined to vnderſtand, not onely the conditions &amp; inclinations of his frinds but alſo of the manner which they vſed to liue in their houſes: for the vnderſtanding wherof, he woulde inquire of the ſeruaunts, ſlaues and labourers that brought them victuals, what they did eate, and what they did drinke, &amp; what their maiſters ſpent in their houſes.
                  Sabina wife vnto Adrian, did write a certeine letter vnto a Romaine gentleman, complaining that he would not come to viſite her, through ye pleaſures of Britaine, &amp; newe loues in that countrey yt he had taken in hand, which letter happening by chaunce into the handes of Adrian, &amp; the knight vnderſtanding

therof, neither went to Rome or abode in Britan. All things ſet in order in greate Britan, Adrian had intelligence, that in Gallia Tranſalpina, which nowe is named ſwéete Fraunce, a popular ſedition was raiſed, in ſuch euil maner, that if it were not preſently cut off, it might break out into a long &amp; cruel warre. All the contention was raiſed vpon certein boūds &amp; paſtures, in a place called Apim:
                  Preſently Adrian paſſed into Gallia, &amp; perſonally went to ſée ye marks &amp; bounds therof: &amp; the one &amp; the other heard, he did diuide thoſe bounds &amp; limits equally betwixt them. When as a Romaine ſaide vnto Adrian, yt it was the office of a poore Iudge, &amp; not of a mightie Emperour, he anſwered: I had rather diuide boundes in peace, then conquer countries with warre. Now, when Adrian would departe from Fraunce, he receiued newes from Rome, howe Plotina wife vnto Traiane was dead: and as ſhée had béen his onely miſtreſſe, &amp; his ſpecial friend, he felt her death ſo ſenſibly yt beſides ſighing &amp; wéeping, he grewe ſo extremly ſorrowful, yt he did not eate in long time.
He ſtaide in the place where he receiued theſe newes many moneths, and preſently did write vnto ye Senate, yt 
                  Plotina ſhould be adored amongſt ye Goddeſſſes: and on the other parte, he cō
                  maunded coſtly &amp; generous ſacrifices to be offered for her: he did edifie vnto her honour &amp; perpetual memorie, a temple neare vnto Manſin, which he erected vppon pillers of marueilous marble, &amp; did endue with great riches. The affaires of Fraunce being diſpatched, he came by ye 
                  Pyrineā
                   hilles, into Spaine, &amp; ſtaied a whole Winter in the citie of Taragon: which in thoſe auncient times, was the moſte ſtrong, riche, &amp; alſo moſt eſtéemed in all Spaine. When the Emperour Octauius did conquer Cantabria, he did builde in Taragon, a moſt noble houſe, which by the antiquitie therof was much decayed: ye emperour Adrian at his own coſt, cōmaūding to be reedified in ſuch wiſe, yt by repairing the decayed edificies, he renued there ye name of Romanes. The imperiall houſe being made, Adrian kept court there with all the mightie and noble men of Spaine: where and with whome he made manye and good lawes: and in

eſpeciall, he commaunded that the father whiche had but one ſonne, ſhould commit the ſame vnto the warres, if he had twaine, the ſecond ſhould be committed vnto ſcience, and the thirde ſhoulde learne ſome occupation in the common wealth.
               
               The Spaniardes complained, that the ſhippes of Italie did tranſport many thinges out of Spaine, that is to ſaye, golde, ſiluer, ſilke, oyle, yarne, wheate, and wine: and out of Italie, they brought nothing into Spane: whereupon Adrian commaunded, that no ſtraunge ſhip ſhoulde lade any thing out of Spaine. Adrian gaue greate rewardes vnto many, and ſome for company, he cauſed to goe with him, and others ſome he gaue offices bothe by Sea and land, of great honour: and generally, he gaue money vnto all cities, to repaire their decaied walles, in ſuche wiſe, that all Spaine, of him, helde them ſelues right well contented. There in Taragon, Adrian walking alone in a garden, by chaunce, a young man being madde, brake forth vppon him with ſwoorde drawne: Adrian, although without armour, did take away his ſwoord, without commaundement of correction, either to him or his maiſter, &amp; alſo with great pitie, prouided for his cure: of which déed Adrian was praiſed for valiant and pitifull. Alſo in the prouince of Taragon, they had cotētion for their bounds, wherein Adrian prouided to plant lande markes of ſtone, after the maner of pillers, to the ende, that they ſhoulde neither be ſtolne or chaunged.
            
            
               CHAP. XI. ¶Howe Adrian did paſſe into Aſia, and of the things that chaunced there.
               ALl the prouinces of Spaine being viſited, Adrian made his nauigation, by the Sea Mediterrane vnto the Iſle of Sicyl, where he mounted the hill Aetna, to behold the marueilous thinges therein conteined: from whence he

deſcended more in feare and abaſhed, then either inſtructed or ſatiſfied. Adrian being deſcended from the hill Aetna, aſtonied, wearied and alſo derided, ſtaide not in that kingdome, but to viſite the woorkes of the good Traiane, which he did amplifie with buyldinges, and indued with patrimonies. Adrian being reſident in Sicyl, vnderſtoode that Aſterlike the greateſt lorde of Germanie was dead, in whoſe place he preſently created a king, whom he ſent to gouerne the ſame, bothe well receiued, and better obeyed: bycauſe the Germaines helde them ſelues eſcandalized, in that they had not kinges to gouerne them, but Conſuls to chaſtice them.
               The Mauritans, and the Numidians being diuided in cruell diſſention, and vnderſtanding that Adrian was in Sicyl, readie to paſſe into Africa: amongeſt them ſelues they cut off all cauſes of warre, and concluded an aſſured peace. At that time alſo the Parthians ſoudeinly did arme them ſelues, came into the fielde, made captaines, and fortified their frontiers: and brought their ſeigniorie to be ouer the Romaines, and not the Romaines ouer the Parthians. Adrian being aduertiſed of this commotion, prepared a greate armie to paſſe into Aſia, and alſo did write vnto the Parthians, giuing to vnderſtand, that he helde them as his friendes, and the Senate eſtéemed them as brethren, and not as vaſſals: wherewith the Barbarians were ſo muche ſatiſfied, that preſently they left their armour, and proclaimed peace throughout the lands. Notwithſtanding, he was aduertiſed of the Parthians retire, he alwayes continued his nauigation into Aſia: and deſcended firſt in Achaia, and entred Eluſin, a famous citie of that prouince: and leading a great armie, &amp; poſſeſſing but little money, he ſeazed the ſacred thinges of the temples, ſaying, that he did it not, as a Romain Prince, but as a Grecian: for that Hercules and Philip béeing Greeke Princes, had firſt done and attempted the ſame. He alone did enter the temples of Aſia, which was holden for great valiantneſſe: becauſe without armour, he entred amongeſt

the armed Prieſtes: and being demaunded, why he would enter to robbe thoſe temples alone and vnarmed, aunſwered: becauſe, from our barbarous enimies we take by violence, but from the Gods by requeſt.
               
                  Adrian departed alſo vnto Athens, and curiouſly did conſider the order of their ſtudies, and the maner of their life: and ſaide, that in Athens, there was nothing perfect, but Agonata the ſwoorde player: becauſe he had greater readineſſe and ſkill to playe with the ſwoorde, then the Philoſophers in teaching Sciences: Whiche notwithſtanding, he did greatly honour the Philoſophers: and to ſome townes, he gaue great liberties: from thence, he returned to Rome, where he ſtayed but to viſite, to honour, and alſo to bewaile and mourne vppon the tumbe of Plotina. Which being finiſhed, Adrian againe went into Sicyl, and from thence into Africa, where he did viſit many townes and cities, reedified certeine buyldinges, baniſhed diuers Numidians, and alſo Mauritanes, for their mutinies. From thence he did paſſe once more into Aſia, ſtreight vnto Athens, where he finiſhed a certeine temple which he had begonne, dedicating ye ſame vnto the God Iupiter, wherein he did ingraue the Image of Traiane, &amp; did paint with his owne handes the figure of Plotina, his
moſte eſpeciall ſouereigne ladye and miſtreſſe. The greateſt exerciſe that Adrian did vſe in Aſia, was in buylding, repairing, and conſecrating temples: wherein he did place his name, and paint with the pencill, or elſe in Alabaſter did graue his figure.
               
               
                  Adrian feaſted and made a greate banquet vnto king Coſdroe, at that time king of Parthians, &amp; alſo did reſtore him his daughter, which was committed for hoſtage vnto the good Traiane, and a litter curiouſly wrought with ſiluer, golde and Vnicorne, and gaue him alſo many other iewels. Many kinges of Aſia and other greate Princes, came to viſite and to honour Adrian, who gaue them all ſo noble entertainement, and ſo highly rewarded them, that greate was the honour and magnificence he obtained amongeſt

them. Pharaſmano king of the Albans refuſinge to viſite the Emperour Adrian, and to renue the league made betwixt him and the good Traiane: not many dayes after, Adrian wanted not occaſion to diſpoſſeſſe him of his eſtate, and to baniſhe him all Aſia, conſtrained thereby to craue vpon his knees, which would haue béen giuen him, ſitting in his chayre. Adrian, traueiling and iourneying throughout Aſia, viſiting his preſidentes, procurors, and chiefe officers, finding amongeſt them faultes of great enormitie, did puniſhe the ſame with moſte cruell chaſtiſementes. The cauſe is not vnknowen of the diſpleaſure that Adrian did beare vnto Antioche, which hatred was ſo greate, that he trauailed to diuide Syria from Phoenicia, to the ende that Antioche ſhoulde not be the head of ſo many prouinces. Viſiting alſo the whole countrie of Arabia, he came vnto the renoumed citie of Peluno, onely to viſite the ſepulture of the great Pompeius, which he renued and enriched, and alſo did offer greate and ſumptuous ſacrific

                  s, in the honour of the great Pompeius: wherof the Romaine people being aduertiſed, receiued no ſmall delight. He did not onely honour the ſepulture of Pompeius, but alſo gaue greate rewardes vnto the people of Peluſio, becauſe they had that ſepulchre in reuerence, placing vppon the ſepulchre with his owne handes this verſe as followeth: Oſſa viri magni, tenni quam blauſa ſepulchro.

               CHAP. XII. ¶Of the great liberalitie that Adrian vſed, and ſome cruelties that he committed.
               ONe of the thinges, wherin the Emperour Adrian deſerued moſt iuſtly to be praiſed was, yt wt al mē he vſed

great magnificence and liberalitie: for that naturally, in receiuing he was a niggard: but in giuing very bountifull. There was not euer any thing demaunded, that he gaue not: if it were not preuented by ſome others ſuite, which alwayes he did recomfort with hope for time to come.
The rewardes of his nobleneſſe, was the gift of townes, cities, caſtles, Prouinces, kingdomes, mountaines, riuers, flockes or heardes, ſalt mariſhes, milles, offices: and not onely ſuch as hapned in the gouernement of the common wealth: but alſo he gaue the horſſes out of his ſtable, the garments for his perſon, the prouiſion for his diſpences, and the money for his chamber: in ſuch wiſe, that to deliuer others from neceſſitie, he brought him ſelfe in to want of prouiſion.
                  Adrian in his life was noted of diuers weakneſſes and defections, which were both coloured and couered, with his large and bountifull giftes. Great were the rewardes that he gaue vnto Epiteus, and Eliodorus philoſophers: but much more was his liberalitie towardes Phauorinus, bycauſe he both gaue him great goodes, and honour in the common wealth. His cuſtome was, when he ſent for any to ſerue him in the warres, to giue him al things neceſſarie for ye ſame, that is to ſay, armour to fight, &amp; money to ſpend. Adrian being aduertiſed of a noble gentleman of Numidia, named Malacon, a man both valiant &amp; warlike: who refuſing to receiue the vſuall rewarde that Adrian gaue vnto ſuche as did accompanie him in warres, ſayde vnto him: It is more reaſon that I ſhould preuent thée, in doing mine office, then thou ſhouldeſt precede mée in doing thy dutie: which is to ſay, that before thou beginne to fight, I ſhoulde beginne to gratifie thée: for in the end, it is much more that thou doeſt for me, in aduenturing thy life, then I in rewarding thée with my goods. Many times Adrian would boaſt him ſelfe, that he coulde neuer remember that he had eaten alone, but alwayes did eate in the companie of Philoſophers that diſputed in Philoſophie: eyther elſe of capteines, that did talke and conferre in matters of warre.
               
                  He was neate in his apparell, curious and delicate in his diet.
Examining the order of the diet of his houſholde, and finding the prouiſion prouided for the honour thereof, to be imbeziled and purloyned by officers, he commaunded them to be whipt, and turned out of his gates: for notwithſtanding, he had a noble mynde, to giue a Prouince for a reward, he had not patience to ſuffer or endure, the deceit or ſtealth of a pennie. Adrian was a man both ſeuere, gladſome, graue, courteous, pleaſant, ſuffering, raſhe, patient, furious, a ſauer, liberall, a diſſembler, pitifull, &amp; cruell: finally, he was variable in his vices, and inconſtant in vertues: bycauſe he did not long abſteine from euill, eyther long continue in doing good.
                  
                     Adrian vnto his friendes, was bothe gratefull and vnkinde: that is to ſay, he gaue them much goods, and did not much eſtéeme their honour. Great inconuenience did followe the Emperour Adrian, for his infidelitie and want of faith vnto his friendes: which did moſt clearely ſhewe it ſelfe in Tatianus, Nietus, Seuerus, and Septitius: whom at one time he helde for friends, &amp; after did perſecute them as enimies. Eudemius a noble Gentleman of Rome, he was ſo great a frend with Adrian, that he offered ſacrifices vnto the gods to giue him the Empire: and after Adrian did beare him ſo great hatred, that he did perſecute him, not onely to caſt him out of Rome, but alſo vntill he had brought him to extreme pouertie. Polenus and Marcellus, were of Adrian ſo euil handled and perſecuted, that they choſe rather to dye with their owne handes: then to liue vnder his gouernement. Eliodorus, a moſt famous man in letters, both Gréeke and Latine, was not onely of Adrian perſecuted, but alſo put to death, and torne in pieces: whoſe death was much be wailed for that he was profitable vnto the whole comon wealth. Oluidius, Quadratus, Catalius, &amp; Turbon, auncient Conſuls, were by Adrian perſecuted, although not put to death, bycauſe euery one ſéeking to ſaue his life, were baniſhed Rome and all Italie. The noble Conſul Seuerianus, huſbande vnto Sabina, ſiſter vnto

                     Adrian, of the age of a hundred and ninetie yeares, was conſtrained to dye, for no more, but for that he had reported to haue liued the death of thirtene Emperours, &amp; that if Adrian ſhould dye firſt, it ſhould make vp the number of xiiij. the which, when Adrian vnderſtoode, he rather determined to take him from amongeſt the liuing, then he ſhould reckon him amongſt the deade.
In all things Adrian was very wel learned: that is to ſay, reading, writing, ſinging, painting, fighting, hunting, playing, and diſputing: but that he had therewith a tache or a fault: which was, that if he knewe muche, he preſumed much, wherein he was noted of all men, bycauſe he ſcorned all men. After he entered into Aegypt, he gaue him ſelfe vnto Aſtrologie: and held for cuſtome yearely to write out of that ſcience, of al things that ſhould happen that yeare: which alſo he did in the yeare that he dyed, but obteined not the knowledge thereof.
               
                  Adrian in one thing did ſéeme to excell, in that he neuer deſired the knowledge of any facultie, art, or ſcience: but that he procured to be ſingular. He ouercame many warres with armes, but he did appeaſe and cut off many more with giftes: bicauſe vnto diuers peoples, cities, and townes, he gaue libertie and priuileges, and to his Lords and viceroyes, he gaue great rewardes. Although in ſome particular things, touching both friendes and enimies, he ſhewed him ſelfe both affectionate, and alſo paſſionate: vniuerſally, as touching the weale of the common welth, Adrian was alwayes friend in miniſtring iuſtice. When there happened any graue matters, at the ſouden, he wold furiouſly be altered: but at the time of iudgement and determinatiō, ſeriouſly he did both conſider &amp; examine them. He did ſildome determine matters without counſel, and to this end chiefly vſed the aduice of Siluius and Neratius, the moſt learned of that age, and approued by the Senate. Naturally, he was of an vnquiet heart, and of condition intermedling. It did happen vnto him many times in reading of hiſtories, when he found of any place or coū
                  trie,

that was poſſeſſed of any extremitie, or ſingularitie, that he could not come to the viewe thereof, with extreme deſire, he did many times growe both ſicke and ſorrowfull. Notwithſtanding he was large and of great magnanimitie with Philoſophers, with countries, with men of warre, and with his friends: much more was his magnificence to the miniſters of iuſtice: and being demaunded of Fauorinus, why he was ſo boūtiful vnto them, anſwered: I make the miniſters of iuſtice riche: bycauſe, by robberie of iuſtice, they ſhall not make other men poore.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XIII. Of the lawes that Adrian made.
               MAny and right neceſſarie lawes were made by Adrian, whiche were approued by the Senate, and receiued of the common wealth, and long time obſerued. He did ordeine, that if any man would remoue from one citie to an other, that at his owne libertie he might ſell his houſe, but not to aduenture to pull it downe, eyther to ſel or make profite of the ſtuffe therof: bycauſe the authoritie of a common wealth is impayred, when the buildings be ruinated.
                  He did alſo ordeine, that when any man was condemned to dye for offences of great enormitie, and his goodes confiſcate, that his children, ſhoulde inioy the tenth part of thoſe goodes: in ſuche wiſe, that for that, whiche was taken from them, they had to bewaile the offence of their fathers, and for that which was giuen them, they ſhoulde féele, and alſo commende the clemencie of the Prince.
               
               Alſo there were certaine caſes forbidden, in whiche if any man did fall, or incurre, he was accuſed as if he had committed great treaſon againſte the eſtate Royall

of the Prince: all whiche Adrian did remoue and adnihilate: affirming, that thoſe lawes, were but of ſmall ſeruice, to the behoofe of the Prince, and to the great offence of the common wealth. Alſo the Romaine Princes did vſe to inherite the goods of ſtraungers: wherin Adrian did ordeine, that the children, or the next of the kinne ſhoulde inioye the ſame. Alſo he ordeined, that what ſo euer he were, that founde hid treaſure, in his owne inheritaunce, ſhould inioy the whole: and if it were founde in an other mans inheritaunce, the owner thereof ſhould haue the one moitie: and if it were founde in publike or common place, that then it ſhould be equally parted with the Confiſcator. Alſo he ordeined, that no man what ſo euer, of his own authoritie ſhould kill his ſlaue, for any offence: but to be remitted vnto the Iudge, deputed by the Prince. Alſo he made a lawe of refourmation, both for eating of ſuperfluous meates, and alſo for wearing of garments, eyther too
many, or ouer coſtly. Alſo he did ordeine, that none what ſo euer, ſhould goe or be carried in a litter: and one whiche he had, he commaunded for example, to be burnt, in the market place.
He alſo commaunded that Conſuls, and Senatours, within the compaſſe of Rome, ſhould weare their gownes, whiche was a garment of peace. He alſo ordeined, that yong men that wanted their parentes, ſhuld haue tutors vnto the age of fiue and twentie yeares: although they were married. He alſo did ordeine, that no ſlaue ſhould be ſolde, eyther man or woman, to any ruffian, ieſter, or iuggler: affirming the poſſeſſion of ſlaues, to be moſt vniuſt, vnto ſuche as wander in idleneſſe all the dayes of their life. Alſo he did ordeine, that merchants, or
ſuche as dealt with exchaunge, that brake their credite, or were bankrupts without iuſt cauſe, but only of couetouſneſſe, by defraude to inrich them ſelues: to be ſet vpon the pillorie in the market place, and afterwardes to be baniſhed Rome for euermore.
He did ordeine, that none what ſo euer, ſhould ſuffer execution within the citie of Rome: affirming, that ſo generous a citie, and conſecrate vnto the

Gods, were not conuenient to be defiled with the bloude of wicked men.
Alſo he did ordeine, that men and women ſhoulde haue their ſeuerall bathes, and that who ſo euer ſhould enter into the forbidden place, to ſuffer death for the ſame.
Alſo he did ordaine, that neyther for the Prince or Conſuls, any victuals ſhould be taken from any man: but that euery man might ſell to whome he would, where he would, and how he might. He did ordeine, that no woman ſhuld aduēture to heale with words, eyther that any man ſhuld preſume to cure with cōpound medicines: but to perfourme all their cures, with ſimple hearbes. In buildings he did chiefly imitate his Lord Traiane: that is to ſay, that in all countries, Prouinces, and kingdomes, where he had bene, he erected many and very famous buildings: wherein it is to be noted, that he neuer placed his owne name, but in the temple of Traiane. In Rome, in a manner he wholy renued the temple named Pantheus, dedicated vnto the Goddeſſe Berecyntha, and where all the Gods were honoured. The fielde of Mars in olde time was compaſſed, and by great antiquitie the buildings falne flat vnto the grounde: wherein Adrian did not only renue the decayed wals, but alſo did furniſh ye ſame wt very ſtately buildings. He edified the reall palace named Neptunus, he enlarged the palace of Auguſtus, he reedified the bath of Tyberius, he much aduaunced the temple of Titus: in all theſe edifices, he placed the names of the Princes that in times paſt built them, and not his owne name whiche had reedified them. From the foūdation he built a ſtately bridge, which was afterwards named Adrians bridge. He made alſo for him ſelfe a ſepulchre, ioyning vnto ye riuer Tyber, ye ſtones whereof were brought from India, and the workemen out of Greece.
                  He tranſlated the temple of the Goddeſſe of good Fortune, and the figure of Decian the artificer that was placed therein: that was of ſo great weight, that hardly foure &amp; twentie Eliphants might remoue ye ſame, the whiche figure was dedicated vnto the Sunne: Adrian did erect one other to be dedicated vnto the Moone,

of no leſſe weight or riches then the other: whereof the great Polydore was workman.
He built in Rome a certaine building, which many yeares after was named, the mole of Adrian: and at theſe dayes is called, the caſtle of of Saint Angelo. He remoued many riuers out of their chanels to water the fieldes, brought many fountaines, for prouiſion of cities. In Greece he edified a citie, which in time paſt, was named Adrianopolis. In the kingdome of Paleſtine, he reedified the great citie Hieruſalem, which had béene deſtroyed by Titus and Veſpaſian, and gaue it for name, Elia, for that his owne name was Elius Adrianus.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XIIII. Of ſome of his gratious and pythie ſentences.
               THe Emperour Adrian was a Prince, not only ſharpe of iudgement, and prouident in his affaires, but alſo of great vrbanitie, and gratious in ſpeache. And the caſe
was thus, that Fauorinus a very friende to Adrian, hauing an olde houſe, at the enterie whereof, he had rayſed a ſtately porche paynted white, he ſayde vnto him: This houſe of thine, ſeemeth a gilded pill, whiche outwardly giueth pleaſure, but within is full of bitterneſſe. An other friende of Adrians, named Siluius, very blacke of face, and of euill ſhape of body, and comming on a certaine day vnto the Palace, all clad in white: Adrian ſayde vnto thoſe that were preſent: That blacke face with that white garment, ſeemeth no other but a flye drowned in a ſponefull of mylke. The Emperour Adrian, vppon a time from his Palace, behelde a Senatour, in a long blacke gowne, wearing vpon the ſame a ſhort crimſon cloake in graine:

and demaunding, why he did weare ſuch apparell in that place: the Senatour anſwered.
                  
                     Syr, I walke here with this red cloake, to ſee if my good hap may chaunce to fiſh ſome faire Ladie. Wherevnto Adrian readily anſwered: Thou ſeemeſt rather a red worme to fiſh frogs, then as a man enamoured to fiſhe Ladies.
                  
A certaine perſon with a hoarie heade, crauing a rewarde, whiche at that time the Emperour denyed: the ſayde hoare headed fellowe, remembring him ſelfe, pouling his heade, and ſhauing his bearde, came againe vnto the Emperour, to renue his ſuite: and Adrian beholding howe he was altered, made freſh, and growne young, did anſwere: That which now thou craueſt, I denyed vnto thy father. They helde in Rome many fierce beaſtes, to magnifie a daye of greate feaſting: and when certaine Senatours ſayde vnto Adrian, that it was ſomewhat late, and highe time to go chace the beaſts, he made anſwere: Ye might better haue ſayd, to be chaced of them, then the beaſts to be chaced of men: for if there be ten that dare abide them, there be ten myllians that runne away.
               
               
                  There was in Rome, a certaine man named Enatius, ſomewhat entered in age, and of naturall condition, mutinous, ambitious, importune, intermedling, quarellous, &amp; full of garboyle: and being aduertiſed that Enatius was deade, he fell into a greate laughter, and ſware, that he could not a little maruell, howe he coulde intend to dye: conſidering his great buſineſſe both night and daye. A certaine auncient citizen comming vnto the Emperour Adrian, for certaine ſuites and cauſes propounding his demaunde, and alſo replying an anſwere without intermiſſion, remouing without all manner, any meane for the Emperour to ſpeake, anſwered: Friende, if thou feede on both cheekes, we may not eate both together: Surely, it was an anſwere very fayre, and of great vrbanitie: for, thereby he gaue him to vnderſtande, that if he both propounde and anſwere, he could not giue him iuſtice.
                  
                  There was a Senatour in Rome, named Fabius Cato, of
auncient yeares, and amongſt the people, in great credite: but ioyntly therewith he was a man of a ſmall ſtature, which would ſoone be offended, and as ſoone be pleaſed: vnto whome on a time Adrian ſayde: Since your chimney is ſo ſmall, you muſt beware to lay much wood vpon the fire: for otherwiſe it will be alwayes ſmoakie.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. XV. Of the thinges that he did woorthy prayſe, and ſome other things worthy diſpraiſe.
               THe Emperour Adrian, did vſe and intreate ſuch as did ſerue him, very well and with great affection: but he might not indure them, to preſume to be ouer priuate: for he would ſay, that he held them not to commaund him, but to ſerue him: and grewe not a little diſpleaſed, with ſuch as were not moderate in their déedes, and courteous in their wordes. Being in Spaine in the citie of Taragon, he behelde in a garden, one of his meane ſeruaunts, walking betwixt two Senatours: vnto whome he commaunded to be giuen a great blowe, with this aduertiſement: The Emperour commandeth this blow to be giuen thee, bycauſe thou ſhalt be aſhamed to preſume to walke, with ſuch as thou art bound to ſerue. In his dyet he was neyther temperate, much leſſe a gormound that vſed exceſſe: for that he left not to eate of any thing, in reſpect of health, or vertue: but without dyet, did eate, both what and whē he liked. In wine he had a good relliſh, and at times dranke thereof ſo frankly, that he hindered the health of his perſon, and alſo the credite of his fame. There was in his dayes great earthquakes, peſtilences, dearth, and hunger: in which calamities, he ſhewed him ſelfe a pitifull Prince, and of great magnanimitie: bycauſe in time of hunger, he

gaue the people wherewith to be ſuſteined, and in time of earthquakes, money to reedifie. He diſcharged many cities of their whole tributes, and to others ſome part he releaſed: in ſuche wiſe, that in all his Empire there was no citie, that newly receiued not, ſome benefite at his hande, eyther deliuered not from ſome olde payment. In the firſt yeare of his Empire, the riuer Tyber did ſo ouerflowe, that thrée dayes damage thereof, was not repayred in thrée yeares. He was of the men of warre much feared, for that he did chaſtiſe them: and no leſſe beloued, bycauſe he did pay them. The chiefeſt cauſe, of his great prayſe in Chronicles, or of writers of hiſtories, and the tender affection that the Romaines did beare him, procéeded, that in time of peace, he helde his men of warre in great ciuilitie: and in time of warre, he gouerned the common wealth, as if it had béene in peace.
Alwayes when the Senatours repayred vnto him, eyther to eate, or for affaires, he did alwayes entertaine them ſtanding: and if they were Conſuls, he came foorth to receiue them, and if they were Iudges, he did riſe when they came before him: and if they were officers of the Senate, he would ſomewhat ſtoupe or nod with the head: in ſuche wiſe, that with all, he vſed greate courteſie: and in ſpeache and conference, no leſſe vrbanitie. To repaire temples, to prouide prieſtes, and to offer ſacrifices, he was a Prince both carefull and diligent: and ioyntly therewith it is to be noted, he conſented not to the inuention of newe deuices, and muche leſſe did he admit ſtraunge cuſtomes.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XVI. Whome Adrian did adopt to ſucceede him in his Empire.
               AFter the Emperour Adrian had trauelled in a manner throughout the world, by ſea and lande, and paſſed both colde and heate, he fell into a grieuous ſickneſſe: he

himſelfe, giuing occaſion therof, for that in his dyet, either in the time of heate, or colde, did ſildome or hardly vſe any order. Preſently vpon his ſickneſſe, his heart was touched with great care, vpon the determination, whom he ſhould adopt to the ſucceſſion of the Empire: bycauſe many did followe him, that did much deſire it, but verie fewe that did deſerue it. The death of Seuerian, Dion doth report,
was after this manner. 
                     Adrian on a certaine daye at his dinner, ſayd vnto the Conſuls that ſate at his table: I would haue you name me ten men, in ſcience learned, and ſincere of life: vnto one of which I may commend, after my dayes, the eſtate of the common wealth. They all vſing ſilence vnto that demaund, Adrian ſayd: reckon me but nine, for I haue one, and ſuch a one, as is my brother in lawe, Seuerian: for that he hath both age, and grauitie, After a fewe dayes, that theſe things did paſſe, Adrian being in great daunger through a fluxe of bloude, that brake foorth without ceaſſing at his noſe: doubting that firſt his life ſhoulde haue finiſhed, before the bloude would haue ſtaunched: did point with his finger, Lucius Cōmodus to be his ſucceſſour. And after recouering more health, he was aduertiſed, that Seuerian and Fuſcus his nephew, continued murmuring, at that whiche he had commaunded: and that vnto him the Empire was not directed: Adrian beganne to diſdaine and abhorre him with great hatred. This Seuerian of the age of ninetie yeares, Adrian commaunded to be ſlaine: bycauſe he ſet him ſelfe in the imperiall chaire, and gaue vnto ſuch as were in fauour with the Emperour, a ſolemne ſupper, and bycauſe in ſecrete, he had conference with the capteines of warres. Before that Seuerian dyed, hée determined to haue giuen the Empire vnto the Conſul Fuſcus, which was his nephewe: but when Adrian vnderſtoode, that Fuſcus had conference with Magicians and Soothſayers, to be aduertiſed, if he ſhould inioy the Empire, he put him to death: in ſuche wiſe, that he both loſt the inheritaunce, and alſo his life. Pletorius Metus, came to viſite Adrian in his ſickneſſe:

which being his great frend, he would neither heare nor ſée: bicauſe he did imagine, yt he came not to viſite, but to inherite. Gentian the Conſul, a noble and auncient Romaine, alſo he perſecuted, for no other cauſe, but for that he vnderſtoode, he was both liked and honoured of the Senate: and that all men did hope hée ſhoulde ſuccéede him in the Empire. The Emperour Adrian did neuer ſhewe him ſelfe ſo cruell in his life, as he did ſomewhat before his death: bycauſe all thoſe that he thought, did hope to ſuccéede him in the Empire, he commaunded to be baniſhed or ſlayne. Being ſicke in a village, named Tiburtina, of a fluxe of bloude, where he remained many dayes bothe deſperate, vnruly, and out of temper: for that he had no patience, to thinke that he ſhoulde dye, and an other ſhoulde ſuccéede him.
               
               
                  There was alwayes ſome vnkindneſſe betwixt him, and the empereſſe Sabina, but in the end, Adrian vſed ſuch ſkill, that ſecretly he gaue poyſon vnto his wife Sabina, whereby ſhe finiſhed his life, and he loſt his ſuſpicion. When Adrian perceiued that of neceſſitie he muſt néeds dye, and that an other muſt haue his Empire, he appointed Cenoio for his ſucceſſour, ſonne in lawe vnto Niger: and this he did againſt the mindes of all them whiche did ſerue him, and alſo of all ſuch as did beſt loue him: bicauſe many others ſéemed to be of more deſeruing, and alſo of more abilitie to gouerne the Empire. Vnto this Cenoio he gaue the name of Elio vero Caeſar: and to the ende it ſhould be gratefull vnto the people, and confirmed of the Senate: he gaue them the Circen playes, which was vnto them very acceptable, &amp; did diſtribute throughout Rome, foure thouſand Sextercies. Preſently vpon the adoptiō of Cenoio, he gaue him the Pretourſhip, he placed him before the Panoniaes, which were admitted to goe next his perſon, did create him the ſecond time Conſul, did ſet him at his owne table, and did permit to accompanie him in the litter: finally, Adrian did intreate him as his ſonne, and all did ſerue him as their Lord.
               
               
                  Preſently after that, Cenoio was adopted, he fell ſicke, of the diſeaſe of death: in ſuche wiſe, as he had not leaſure to giue thankes vnto the Senate: whereof Adrian being aduertiſed, ſayde vnto the Senate: Vnto a weake wall were we ſtated, that day when Cenoio was elected. 
                  
                     Cenoio
dyed in the Kalends of Ianuarie, for which cauſe he was not bewailed of the people: for that moneth being dedicated vnto the God Ianus, no Romaine durſt bewaile the dead, eyther vtter any ſorrowes for the liuing.
                  Adrian finding him ſelfe more oppreſſed with infirmitie, did adopt and declare Antoninus Pius his ſucceſſour: vpon condition, that he ſhould adopt the good Marcus Aurelius, and his brother Annius Verus. The adoption of Antoninus, was diſpleaſant vnto ſom, but eſpecially vnto Attilius Seuerus who with great care did ſolicite the Empire for him ſelfe: and at that time being Prefect of the citie, ſome he did corrupt with money, and ſome with faire promiſes: but Adrian being aduertiſed of ye web that Attilius had in hande, did not commaund him to be ſlaine, but to be baniſhed all Italie.

               ON the day that Adrian commaunded the olde Seuerian to be put to death, before the executioner came to cut his throte, in a veſſel he put certaine coles, adding thervnto ſome incenſe, lifting vp his eyes vnto heauen, he ſaid: You immortall Gods I take to witneſſe, if I be culpable wherein I am accuſed, and for which this daye I am condemned and put to death, and ioyntly therewith I requeſt and beſeech you, that in teſtimonie of my innocencie, ye giue me no other reuengement: but that when Adrian ſhall deſire to dye, he may not dye.
               
               For the time that the Conſul Seuerian was executed, Adrian neuer inioyed one day of health, but many times deſired to dye, and ſought occaſions to kyll him ſelfe:

but Antoninus Pius vnderſtanding thereof, commaunded him to be guarded by daye, and watched by night.
Being aſſayled with extreme infirmitie, and not able eyther to eate, or ſléepe, he many times ſought venome to drinke, ſometimes he would haue a knife to kill him ſelfe, ſometimes he wold not eate, by pure hūger to haſten his death: whereof the Senate being aduertiſed, they did humbly craue, that it might pleaſe his excellencie, to haue patience in that infirmitie, ſince the Gods were pleaſed to lengthen his life. Adrian was much deſpited, with this ſuite of the Senate: and ſo much diſpleaſed with him that ſayd it, that he ſhould be taken and put to death. Adrian had a Barbar named Maſtor, both faithfull and valiaunt, that did attend on his perſon when he did hunt, being his auncient ſeruaunt: whom he did moſt inſtantly deſire, and ſecretly threaten, to diſpatch him of his life: but the barbar being terrified, to heare ſuch wordes, fled out at gates.
By chaunce he recouered a knife into his handes, wherewith he would haue diſpatched him ſelfe: but by force it was taken from him, but therewith and from thence forwarde, more deſirous to dye, and his life more hatefull vnto him.

                     Adrian had alſo a Phyſician borne in Africa, this man he did moſt inſtantly requeſt, to miniſter vnto him ſome poyſon, to finiſh his ſorrowful and moſt wretched life: ſo hatefull vnto him ſelfe: but the Phyſician was ſo faithfull vnto his lord, &amp; not able to reſiſt the ſuit of his ſouereigne, determined to drink ye ſame, &amp; to die. Adrian holding him ſelf,
for ye moſt vnfortunat, &amp; the extremeſt wretch in diſtreſſe, that ſo much deſired death, and could not but liue: &amp; moſt truly ye ſuit of Seuerian vnto the gods, was moſt throughly perfourmed in him: that is to ſay, that they woulde inlarge his life, when he ſhould deſire to dye. Antoninus Pius being now declared, and confirmed for Caeſar, and Adrian euery day finding him ſelfe to growe in weakneſſe, departed from Rome, vnto the port of Baias, where he remained, vſing many experiences in medicines and Phyſicke: which for his health did little profite, and to ſhorten

his life, gaue ſome aſſiſtaunce. Adrian dyed in that port of Baias, the ſixt day of Iuly: and was buried in a village named Ciceroniana. He liued thréeſcore and two yeares, and reigned one and twentie yeares, ſixe monethes, and ſixtene dayes. Before Adrian dyed, he commaunded this verſe to be placed vpon his ſepulchre. Turba medicorum, Regem interfecit. Which is to ſay, The Emperour Adrian by truſting Phyſicians, gaue ſo haſtie an end vnto his yeares.

               CHAP. I. ¶ Of the lineage and countrie of the Emperour Antoninus Pius.
               
                  THe naturall countrie of the Emperour Antoninus Pius, was of Gallia Tranſalpina, whiche is as muche to ſay, of ſwéete Fraunce: and was borne in a citie named Nemeſa, whiche from the time of Iulius Caeſar, was eſtabliſhed a Colonell of Rome. His grandfather was named Titus Fuluius, a man both generous and valiaunt, who in the times that Iulius Caeſar did conquer Fraunce, did vtter his greate parcialitie in the behalfe of the Romaine Empire: for whiche cauſe after the warres were ended, he came to Rome. Titus Fuluius in paſſing

into Italie, and ſetling in Rome, had happie and great ſucceſſe: for the Fathers of the Senate, beſides their recompence for ſeruice, they made him a citizen of Rome. He had ſuche ſkill to profite him ſelfe by that libertie, and proued ſo cunning to content the people, that within the ſpace of foure yeares, he was twice Conſul, once Gouernour of the citie, and once Iudge: in ſuche wiſe, that his vertue was more beneficiall then others, to be naturall of the countrie.
               The father of Antoninus Pius, was named Fuluius Aurelius: a man vertuous and learned, and no leſſe then his grandfather Titus, was twice Conſul: his grandmother of the mothers ſide, was named Bobinia, and the father of his mother, whiche was, Arrius Antoninus, was no leſſe eſtéemed in the Romaine Empire, then was his other grādfather: for he was Iudge two yeres, Maſter of the horſſe men one yeare, Tribune of the people an other yeare, and in the ende, two times Conſul. This Arrius Antoninus, was a great perſecuter of Domitian, a great friende of Nerua, and verie priuate with Traiane: whiche when he perceiued Nerua to accept the Empire being ſo olde, he had greate compaſſion of him, and ſayde theſe wordes: My friende Nerua, I giue thee to vnderſtande, eyther it is ſome curſſe from thy predeceſſours, or ſome vengeaunce that the Goddes will take of thee: ſince they permitte thee to take the Empire, and at the time of moſt neede, to haue counſell, they depriue thee of thy ſound and good iudgement.
               
               The good olde Nerua, did ſo ſenſibly féele theſe wordes, ſpoken by his friende Antoninus, that had it not béene by the great importunitie of Traiane, he had preſently renounced the Empire: which if he had done, as afterwards he did, he had not erred: bycauſe his age was too greate, and his ſtrength but weake. Antoninus Pius had a father in lawe, named Iulius Lupus, which long time was a Senatour, that deſired not to beare office, but with his patrimonie to liue in quietneſſe.
               
                  
                  Antoninus Pius married with the daughter of Annius Verus, who was named Annia Fauſtina, a woman of excelling beautie, and this was mother vnto the famous Fauſtine, wife vnto the great Emperour Marcus Aurelius. Antoninus Pius, and Fauſtine his wife had two ſonnes, which died in their youth: and alſo two daughters, of which the elder was married vnto the Conſul Sillanus, which alſo died in their youth. The ſecond daughter (as the mother) was named Fauſtine, &amp; married vnto Marcus Aurelius, in whome the ſucceſſion of the Empire did remaine. Antoninus Pius had but one ſiſter, named Iulia Fadilla, whome he tenderly loued: not onely, for that he had no more, but becauſe they were twinnes and borne both at a birth, Antoninus Pius was borne the xiii. daye of October, at a certeine place named Laurina: which afterwardes he did nobilitate with ſtately buyldinges, and indued with great priuileges, and alſo did amplifie the boundes thereof, which were but ſhort and narrowe. In the moſte time of his infancie, he was nouriſhed with his fathers father: and being more entred into yeres, he continued with his other graund father by the mothers ſide: and was ſo vertuous and ſo well inclined, that he was pleaſing vnto all men, and beloued of all perſons: he attained to be knowen vnto all his grandfathers both of father and mother, who all fixed their eyes vppon Antoninus, as well to inueſt him with learning, as to endue him with riches and wealth: for, as he afterwards reported of them, they vſed to ſaye, that they fauoured him more for his vertue, then for affinitie. With his graundfathers he learned both tounges of Greeke and Latine, he gaue him ſelfe more to Coſmographie, then to any other ſcience, and did muche delight to talke with men of ſtraunge nations, to giue them to vnderſtande, that he did knowe all the particularities of their countries, by ſcience, as they did by experience. Being ſo intirely beloued of his graundfathers, they helde him alwayes in company with Philoſophers: who of his owne natural: condition, delighted not,

but in the company of the vertuous: whereof it procéeded, that after he became ſo cruell an enimie vnto the wicked, and ſo perfect a friend vnto good men. The cuſtomes and companies that Princes do take in their youth: they loue and followe afterwardes when they be men.
               
            
            
               CHAP. II. ¶Of the inclination, proportion, and naturall faſhion of his bodie.
               
                  ANtoninus Pius was of an high ſtature, ſlender and very ſtreight, his eyes ſomewhat outward, black hayre, thicke bearde, white, rare, and gaptothed, his face white, merrie, gladſome, and faire, in ſuch wiſe, that he did rather prouoke, to be loued, then feared. Naturally, he was of great health: his téeth excepted, which he loſt before he came to age.
When a certeine cunning man made offer to be bound to place him téethe wherewith to ſpeake and eate: Antoninus made him aunſwere: Since neuer from my harte proceeded fained or double woords: there ſhall neuer enter into my mouth, counterfete teeth. The want of his téeth, made him to eat with paine, and ſtutter in his ſpéeche. Being touched with a Ieſter for his ſtammering, Antoninus aunſwered: I recke not greatly to ſtumble in wordes, ſo that I erre not, and ſtand vp right in deedes. In Rome there was a Senatour named Taurinus, liberall in ſpéeche, and not ſober in diet, who reprouing Antoninus for that his téeth failed him, bothe to eate and ſpeake, aunſwering, ſaide: I conſent to that which thou ſaieſt: for that I, if I woulde, may not be a glutton: but thou maiſt, and wilt not leaue to be malicious. Many Princes did excell Antoninus Pius in ſcience, but none did matche him in eloquence: for that ordinarily, he did talke in the Latine tounge, &amp; did diſpute in the Greeke.
                  
He was naturally very well conditioned, which had in him moſte apparance, for that alwayes his woords

were without malice, and his thoughtes without ſuſpicion. Although he were of complexion cholerike ſanguine which giueth men occaſion to be raſhe and ſoudein, it had no place in Antoninus Pius, for that he was conſtant in aduerſities, and patient in iniuries. When in his preſence they ſaide any woordes that did grieue or offende him, or brought him any ſorrowfull newes: in biting of his lipp, in caſting downe his eyes, and laying one hand vpon another, they vnderſtood his great ſorrow: but ioyntly herewith, he was neuer ſéene of any man, ſoudeinly to chaunge countenaunce, muche leſſe to ſpeake any cruell or iniurious woorde. Before he was Emperour, he was the welthieſt man of all the Empire: for that he did inherite from his foure graundfathers, greate and ample patrimonies: vnto whome he was ſole inheritour. He was giuen to gather, conſerue and augment his goodes, riches and wealth, but without all oppreſſion to any perſon, for that he liued onely of him ſelfe, defrauding no man of his ſuite. After he obteined the Empire, when by chaunce any talke was moued of the couetouſneſſe of men, and of the neceſſitie of Princes, many times he woulde ſaye: I giue thankes to the immortall Gods, that ſince I haue beene Emperour, I haue not taken any thing from any man: either before, that euer I was benighted with debt.
                  He had great affection to the woorkes of the fielde, and therein had not onely the tooles and thinges neceſſarie for the purpoſe: that is to ſaye, buffes, oxen, cartes, ploughes, but he him ſelf would be occupied in ſowing corne, cutting vines, pruning trées, and at times would take the plough, and make a dozen of furrowes.
He was extreme in nothing, but that in, and for all thinges, he placed him ſelfe in the middeſt: which he did very well diſcouer in the gouernement of his perſon and eſtate: wherein, neither for his prodigall expence, he was noted proude: either for want of a noble minde, eſtéemed a niggard. Many times the Heauens being cleare, and a ſettled faire weather in apparance, he would ſaye: vppon ſuche a daye wee ſhall

haue raine, or chaunge of weather, wherein he neuer erred: and manye times did aduouche, that the knowledge thereof procéeded not of ſcience, either of Philoſophie, but of certeine experiences, which he gathered, when he vſed the labour of the fielde.
When on a certeine time, with his knife he was pruning of a plumb trée in his orcharde ioyning vnto the high way, a Senatour ſaide vnto him: ſince you are an Emperour, ceaſſe to vſe the office of a labourer, vnto whome Antoninus aunſwered: it is leſſe euil for an Emperour to prune trées in his orcharde, then to conſume loſt time in his palace. He was very attentiue to that which was ſaide, and curiouſly he did conſider, what others did: chiefely to the ende to attaine knowledge: for that naturally, he was ſharpe and of delicate iudgement.
He was alwayes occupied, either in reading, ſtudying, diſputing, or doing ſomethinge with his handes: and wherein he wanted ſkill, he diſdained not to craue to be taught. Alwayes for the more parte, he went bare headed, through much heate he had therein: and one aduiſing him, the ayre of Rome to be very hurtfull, and therefore right neceſſarie to haue his head couered, aunſwered: aſſure mée from troubles of men on earth, and I am aſſured that nothing ſhall offende mée, which the Gods ſhal ſend mée from Heauen. He was of him ſelfe excellent in Muſike, delighted therein, and a greate friende to Muſicians. Antoninus Pius, was ſuche and ſo good, that all heartes did loue him, all toungs did praiſe him, and all ſuche as did not knowe him, but by reporte, had him in admiration: finally, he was compared vnto Numa Pompilius, becauſe in him there were not more vertues to be deſired, either one onely vice to be reprehended.
            
            
               
               CHAP. III. ¶The workes of pietie which he did, and the cauſe, why he was intituled Antoninus Pius.
               
                  ANnius Verus, father of the firſt Fauſtine, and father in lawe vnto Antoninus Pius, became ſo olde, that he was not able to ſit on horſebacke, either to go on foote, but that he was led and ſtaide by the arme, to ſaye his opinion in the Senate: becauſe, from olde putrified men, ripe and found counſels do proceede. Antoninus Pius beeing the man that delighted to leade his old father, did not only giue him way in foule places, but in going vp of ſtaires, did rather ſéeme to beare him, then leade him. Paſſing on
a certeine day, and beholding an olde man named Iulianus led vnto priſon for debt, and vnderſtanding the cauſe, he preſently payed the ſame, and added a worke of more pittie, that payde not onely all his debtes, but gaue him alſo to ſuſteine him &amp; his houſe. For that a penall lawe, prouided in that behalf, that by iuſtice or otherwiſe, none ſhuld ſhead bloud within the compaſſe of Rome:
                  
for his cauſe at the gate Salaria, a place deputed for execution of offenders, and maiſters alſo did there chaſtice their ſeruaunts: and thus it chaunced, that Antoninus Pius, paſſing that way, found there, many ſlaues bounde and beaten moſte cruelly: he conceiued ſo great pitie, to ſée them ſo beaten without pitie, that preſently he bought them all: and the ſame daye he bought them, the verie ſame daye he made
them frée. From his youth it was his inclination to viſite the ſicke, and to accompany ſuche as were in ſorrowe, diſtreſſe, and out of comfort: wherein the good Antoninus did ſo muche vtter the griefe, that he had of their griefe, &amp; he ſo much ſorrowed of their ſorrowe, that no man did ſo ſenſibly féele his owne griefe, as he did bewaile the miſfortune of others.
               
               
                  
                  An auncient Romaine widowe, which had but one ſonne, whoſe miſfortune was to kill another young man, and being condemned to dye, the ſorrowfull mother came lamē
                     ting, wailing, and crying vnto the Emperour Antoninus: with whome he did ſo earneſtly and ſo grieuouſly wéepe, as if it had béene his owne ſonne. And being aduertiſed by his friendes, and his moſt ſpeciall and priuate ſeruaunts how euil it became him to wéepe with and like a woman, aunſwered: that ſorrowfull woman came to craue helpe and ſuccour for her ſonne: and for that I may not relieue her with ſome remedie, I did aſsiſt to bewaile her miſchaunce.
                  
               
               
                  The Romaines had a cuſtome, to leaue the dead bodies of men executed in the fieldes: but Antoninus Pius was the firſt that gaue order for ſuch bodies to be buried: affirming it ſufficient, to take from men their liues, and not to féede beaſtes with their carcaſes. From the time of the proude Tarquine, the Romaines held for cuſtome, to giue malefactours great tormentes: the good Antoninus did take away all tortures, wherwith the members of mans bodie was put in daunger: ſaying, that the torment was ſufficient that were to chaſtice, but not to diſmember. Fabatus, Dioſcorus, Lipolus, Macrinus, Fuluius, Torquatus, Eucenius, Bruſcos, and Emilius, whereof foure being Conſuls, thrée Iudges, and two Pretors, and baniſhed by Adrian, Antoninus gaue them all pardon: and for that many did miſlike this déede, affirming it to be done to the preiudice of the fame and memorie of Adrian, he aunſwered: Adrian my Lorde did not erre in that which he then did: and I thinke I do not erre in that which I nowe doe: becauſe then, he did it to profite him ſelfe by his iuſtice, as I nowe doe to obteine aduauntage by clemencie.
Whether ſo euer he went, either in Rome or other places of Italie, wéekely he did viſite the priſoners, and the poore which he found there for debt, he commaunded the creditours with his owne money to be payde: and after that he had thrée times paide for one man, and the fourth time

found in priſon for debt: he commaunded him to be deliuered vnto his creditour for his ſlaue. A fewe dayes after this commaundement, his clemencie not able to endure ſo rigorous Iuſtice: notwithſtanding the ſentence was moſte iuſt, he prouided at his owne coſt once more to buy and to giue libertie vnto that poore man. As before recited, when Adrian was ſicke, and ſo diſtempered with his infirmities, that ſome he commaunded to be taken, ſome baniſhed, and ſome put to death: but Antoninus Pius being adopted Auguſtus, and being inueſted with the whole gouernement, did neither arreſt, baniſhe, or kill them: but onely commaunded to abſent them ſelues, and not to appeare in his preſence. Amongeſt all the notable workes of pietie that Antoninus did perfourme, was, that Adrian ſtriuing and watching to kill him ſelfe, Antoninus did ouerwhatche to preſerue a liue: being moſte true according to ſenſualitie, he ſhoulde haue procured, and not haue giuen any impediment to haue finiſhed his life: ſince vnto him, bothe houſe, goods, and eſtate ſhoulde ſuccéede.
               The Senatours, &amp; many other magiſtrates of Rome, did attempt to adnihilate the lawes, and monumentes of Adrian: whiche Antoninus did moſt ſtiffely denye, withſtand and repulſe: and in the ende not onely did cauſe all his actes to be ratified, confirmed, and allowed: but alſo did frame and bring to paſſe with the Senate, that Adrian ſhould be accompted amongeſt the Gods. He built in the honour of Adrian a moſte ſolemne temple in a certeine place, named Puſoll, and did furniſhe the ſame with Prieſtes to ſerue him, and endued them with rents to find them, and were commonly named Adrians prieſts. In the honour of Adrian, he did inſtitute certeine playes, intituled Luſtra, to be played euery fifth yere, for the maintenaunce whereof, he gaue great rentes.
               
                  Before Adrian died, he had made for him ſelfe a ſumptuous ſepulchre neare vnto the riuer Tiber, whether Antoninus brought him to be buried, and brought to

paſſe with the Senatours, and the people of Rome, to receiue him with no leſſe honour, then if he had béene a liue. No Prince had reigned in the Empire, that had not béene noted either cruell, or of ſmall pietie, Antoninus Pius excepted: whoe with his tounge, neuer commaunded man to be ſlaine: either woulde euer firme ſentence of death, or euer woulde beholde any man executed: becauſe ſo greate was his clemencie, that he might not beholde the ſheading of bloud.
               
            
            
               CHAP. IIII. ¶Of the woordes that Adrian ſaide vnto the Senate, when he did adopt Antoninus Pius.
               AFter that the Emperour Adrian was recouered of a certeine great ſurfet, it hapned afterwards as he ſate at his dinner, he was taken wt an inceſſant cough, whereof followed a bléeding at the noſe, in ſuche abundance, and with ſuch continuance, that both him ſelfe, and others thought, firſt to haue ſeene him dead, yer the bloud woulde haue ceaſſed to runne. Adrian perceiuing, the greater that his fluxe of bloud did increaſe, ſo muche the more his life did ſhorten: deſiring like a good Prince, to prouide for the weale of his ſubiectes, comaunded all the Senatours, Conſuls, and all other the notable officers of Rome to come before him, vnto whome he briefely ſaide certeine woordes, right worthie to be committed vnto memorie, as followeth.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           His Oration to the aſſemblie.
                           Fathers conſcript, you ſee with greate certeintie, howe ſoudeinly and vnawares death hath aſſailed mee, and by howe ſmall occaſion I loſe my life. Let mee be an example vnto you, and all men,

and holde it for moſt certeine, that that parte of life is moſt times in peril, where, of certeintie of life we had ſetled moſt affiance. Nature hath not graunted me to haue children of mine owne, but therefore I giue great thankes vnto the immortall Gods, becauſe in deliuering mee from children, they haue diſcharged mee of greate and many cares. There goeth muche difference betwixt the ingendering, or the electing of a ſonne: for the one proceedeth of neceſsitie, the other is elect at large, will, and libertie. The ſonnes that nature giueth vs, are many times lame, filthie, and alſo fooliſhe: but ſuch as wee adopt, wee elect them able, ſound and diſcrete: for that no man is ſo imprudent which at the time of election, chooſeth not the beſt. In time paſt, I elected Lucius, ſufficiently knowen vnto you: but the deſtinies were ſo contrary vnto him, that before he had power to commaunde in the ſtate of Rome, he was buried in his ſepulture: but now we haue elected Antoninus for your emperour, whoe wee promiſe you, ſhall proue milde, benigne, quiet, and mercifull: for that clemencie is as naturall vnto him, as it is vnto the Sunne to giue light by daye. He receiueth the Empire in a competent age, to the ende ye feare not, by his too muche youth, to committ ſome raſhe deede, either by too muche olde age, negligently to gouerne the common wealth. He hath beene bred and nouriſhed in our own countrie, and therefore will obſerue the cuſtomes thereof. Alſo his life hath been trained vnder our own lawes, a ſufficient occaſion to auoide all ſearche of vnneceſſarie lawes of ſtraunge countries, and this you haue to regarde, not as a matter of ſmall importance: becauſe there is not any thing that more doeth offende

the common wealth, then to infecte the ſame with ſtraunge and vnuſed cuſtomes. He knoweth what thing it is to go on warrefare, to gouerne armies, to ſuffer both paſsions and motions of people, to vſe clemencie with ſome, and to correct others: in ſuche wiſe, that in him is conteined greate ſufficience, for the gouernement of the common wealth, ſince in all thinges he hath experience. Ye knowe him, and he knoweth you, ye haue dealt with him, and he hath dealt with you: &amp; I hold of him ſuch opinion, that he will neither deſpiſe you, either forget you: in ſuch manner, that his obedience ſhalbe vnto mee, as vnto a father, and ſhal deale with you in loue, like a brother. And I woulde that all you which be here preſent, as alſo all other perſons in Rome, that vpon ſuch condition I tranſferre the Empire, that after his dayes he leaue the ſame vnto Marcus Aurelius his ſonne in lawe, and my ſeruaunt: and from henceforth, I ſweare and proteſt, that theſe two elections ſhalbe acceptable vnto the Gods, and profitable vnto men. In credite, life, and ſcience, Marcus Aurelius doth exceede Antoninus: but that hitherto Antoninus hath had more experience: for which cauſe vnto him, the rather we haue commended the Empire, becauſe, for the generall gouernement of any eſtate or common wealth, one yeare of experience is more worth then ten yeres of ſcience. I haue beene weake, careleſſe and negligent, in many thinges of the common wealth, partely inforced therunto by the greatneſſe of mine enimies, but for the recompence thereof, I do leaue two ſuche Princes one after the other, to gouerne the Empire, which for their ſingularitie in ſcience and vertue, ſhall excell all that be paſt, and I

doubt in equalitie, not to be matched with any their ſucceſſours.
                        
                     
                  
               
               Theſe wordes being ſaide by Adrian, he drewe a ring from his finger, and put the ſame vppon the fingar of Antoninus Pius, and after that houre he was holden, ſerued, and obeyed as Romaine Emperour: notwithſtandinge that Adrian liued ſome time after. Perfect was the election of the Emperour Nerua, in the good Traiane, and no leſſe of Traiane in the adoption of Adrian, and moſte iuſt of Adrian in the election of Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius, which fiue Emperours were ſuch and ſo good, one after the other: which ſéemed a Prognoſtication, that the felicitie of Romaine Emperours, ſhould in them take an ende.

                  BEfore Antoninus Pius came vnto the height of ye Empire, he did oft put foorth his money to vſurie, but all the gaines of that trade, he ſpent in ſuccouring the poore, and redéeming captiues. He was ſent on a time by Adrian to viſite the Iſle of Sicyl: in which viſitation he reformed many people, chaſticed many tyraunts, depriued many officers, remoued many enimities, repaired ruinous buildinges, did melt manye counterfeit coynes: but moſte of all in ſuche manner did gouerne the common wealth, that no man remained diſcontented.
               
               He was iiij. yeares Pretor within Rome, he was Conſul in Campania, with Catilinus Seuerus, he was Iudge thrée yeres together, in al which offices he was neuer noted, either raſhe in commaundements, or rigorous in his chaſticements.
               
                  
                  Adrian diuided all Italie into foure iuriſdictions, placing in euery one a Conſul for gouernement thereof, and eſtabliſhed Antoninus ſupreme gouernour of them all: in ſuch wiſe, that he helde ſuch authoritie and credite, that in Rome all was gouerned by his counſell: and in Italie all did obey his commaundementes. Were his perſon farre diſtant, alwayes Adrian and the Senate had his counſell preſent: the cauſe whereof procéeded of his cleare iudgement, in the foundation of that which he ſaide: and through the bountie of his vertue, he frankly did ſpeake his opinion.
               Wée ſaide not without iuſt cauſe, that by his vertue, he did fréely ſaye his opinion: for ſpeaking the very truth, he is not onely vniuſt, but verie wicked, that hath libertie in his ſpeeche, and hath not vertue in his life. Exerciſing in Aſia the office of Proconſul, he vttered ſo greate wiſedome in his commaundementes, and ſo much without couetouſneſſe in his dealings, that he was intituled, the holy proconſul, which gouernement amongeſt ſtrangers, by a ſtraunger, was a caſe ſomewhat ſtraunge, becauſe deteſtation alwayes accompanieth ſuch gouernement.
               Comming from Aſia vnto Rome, in Antioche he buried his eldeſt daughter: whoe had ſuch fame in her life, that after her death ſhe left behinde a ſlaunderous memorie. Wée haue ſaide howe the wife of Antoninus was named Fauſtine, which was mother vnto the faire Fauſtine wife vnto Marcus Aurelius: and moſte truely, both mother and daughter were touched with infamie, by the meane of too muche libertie, and too little vertue.
               It was neuer ſéene in the Romaine Empire, that two ſo vertuous Princes, had wiues ſo licentious: notwithſtanding the one was ſufficiētly aduiſed, the other corrected: but for that they were ſo gratious in their conuerſation, and ſo perfect beautifull of their perſons: it was very little which was ſaide vnto them, in reſpect of that which was diſſembled.
               
                  
                  Antoninus was ſo limitted in that which he ſaide, and ſo aduiſed in the counſels which he gaue, that he neuer repented that demaunded the ſame. Before Antoninus came vnto the Empire, he was couetous, but afterwardes very liberall: and his wife reprehending, that he vſed no order in giuing or ſpending, he aunſwered: Fauſtine, ſimple is thy iudgement, ſince thou vnderſtandeſt not, that after we were aduaunced vnto the Empire, we loſt all that euer we had, becauſe all Princes of noble mindes be bounde to giue, but haue no licence to kéepe or hoorde.
               The tribute coronall, that is to ſaye, the money that was giuen vnto the Emperours for their coronation: the one halfe therof he gaue vnto the cities of Italie, to relieue the charges of the common wealth. His wife he did both honour, and cauſe to be honoured: and it was in ſuch maner, that he obtained and brought to paſſe with the Senate, that ſhée ſhoulde be intituled Auguſta Fauſtina, and in her owne name to graue and ſtampe certeine money, the whiche is ſéene at theſe dayes. Antoninus was imbraced with ſo ardent affection of the Senate, that without his requeſt, they erected the pictures and counterfeits of his father and mother, his graundfathers, and graundmothers, his brothers and ſiſters, notwithſtanding they were all dead.
               The Circene playes, which were vſed euery fifth yeare, the Senate did ordeine to celebrate euery yere on the daye of his natiuitie. And after that he therefore had greatly gratified the Senate: by greate requeſt he obteyned the celebration of them, to be perfourmed on the day of Adrians death.
               The Senate to ſatiſfie Antoninus, conſented that his wife Fauſtina, ſhoulde be intituled Auguſta: and alſo in the coynes whiche they made, vnto her honour, there ſhoulde be ingrauen, Auguſta Fauſtina: whiche excellencie, was neuer graunted to anye Woman

of Rome: for that in giuing her the title of Auguſta, they gaue her authoritie to ſet her hande to the thinges of the common wealth.
            
            
               CHAP. VI. ¶Howe he helde all prouinces in peace, not by armes, but with letters.
               AMongeſt al the Romaine Princes, there was none, that performed ſo great conſtancie in his affaires, as Antoninus Pius: which procéeded, for that he was not raſhe in his commaundements, either variable in his determinations, but that exactly he conſidered and examined, what he did commaunde: and after, for no importunitie would reuoke the ſame. Antoninus being reſident in the prouince of Campania, ſending vnto the Senate to requeſt a certeine matter, which notwithſtanding the difficultie thereof, was graunted: Gaius Rufus a Senatour, ſaide vnto him. Serene Prince, I beſéeche thée to giue mée to vnderſtande, by what reaſon it is brought to paſſe, that in all thy enterpriſes thou doeſt neuer repent: in all thy requeſtes thou art neuer denied: either in al thy commaundements thou arte neuer diſobeyed. To whome Antoninus made aunſwere: If I repent mée not of any my déedes, it is becauſe I do them according to reaſon: and if my requeſts are not denied of the Senate, it is becauſe I craue not but that which is iuſt: and if in my commaundements I am not diſobeyed, it procéedeth that they are more profitable vnto the common welth then for mine owne perſon.
               Moſt truely theſe were words right worthie of ſuch a mā, and to ye memorie of Princes moſt chiefely to be commended. It was an auncient cuſtome amongſt ye 
                  Romaines, to haue the time limitted for their reſidence in their offices,

that is to ſay, the Dictatour, ſixe monethes, the Conſul one yere, the Pretor two yeres, the Cenſour three yeres, the maiſter of the horſſemen halfe a yeare, and ſo of the reſt.
               
                  Antoninus woulde not conſent vnto this cuſtome, but in euery reſpect did alter the ſame, in ſuch wiſe, that with ſome that ſhoulde haue continued but two or thrée yeares, he helde them in office ſeuen or eight yeares: and others that ſhoulde haue continued thrée yeares, hee diſplaced them in thrée monethes: affirminge, that the good officer ought to be conſerued all the dayes of his life, but the euill, not to be ſuffered one onely daye.
               
                  He ſent Fuluius Tuſculanus, as Pretor into ye prouince
of Mauritania, whome wtin half a yere he depriued of his office: for yt he was bothe impatient &amp; ſome what couetous: and complaining of the iniurie, ſaide and alledged, that in times paſt, he had béene friend vnto Antoninus, which nowe was forgotten. Whereunto Antoninus Pius did aunſwer: thou haſt no reaſon thus vniuſtly to blame mée, becauſe the office was giuen thée by the Emperour, and not by Antoninus: and ſince thou diddeſt offende, not as Fuluius, but as Pretor: euen ſo I diſcharged thée of thine office, not as Antoninus thy old friende, but as an Emperour of the Romaine Empire.
He was not inclined to beginne warres, either in his owne perſon to proſecute the ſame: for he holde opinion, that the Prince with more ſounde counſell ſhoulde commend his warres vnto his Captaines, to the ende in his owne perſon to gouerne the common wealth, then to goe to the warres him ſelfe, and leaue his common wealth vnto others.
               Talkinge on a time in his preſence, of warres and battels, that Iulius Caeſar, Scipio, and Hanibal, had fought and ouercame in the worlde, Antoninus Pius aunſwered: Let euery man holde opinion what he

thinketh good, and praiſe what it pleaſeth him: but for mine owne parte, I doe more glorie in conſeruing peace many yeares: then with warres to conquere many battailes.
               In the ſeconde yere of his Empire, the Britains rebelled, againſt whome he ſent the Conſul Laelius Vrbicus, whoe ſubdued that Iſlande, although afterwards by miſchaunce he loſt his life.
               In the thirde yeare of his Empire, the Mauritanes alſo rebelled, whiche are a people of Africa: againſte whome he ſent the Conſul Murus Ceſpitius, whoe vſed ſo greate policie in thoſe warres, that hée conſtrained them to craue peace. In thoſe dayes the Germaines and the Datians had greate warres amongeſt them ſelues, vppon the diuiſion of certeine territories: but in the ende, after their owne deſtruction, amongeſt them ſelues, they came to ſuche concorde, that they bent their whole force, as cruell enimies againſt Rome, and the countries thereof: proteſting and affirminge, their charges to bée muche more in paying ſo greate, and ſo continuall tribute, then might arriſe by defence of their perſons againſt the Romaine power.
               
                  Antoninus vnderſtanding of this rebellion, hee woulde not preſently ſende foorth an armie, but a Iudge with greate power, to viſite thoſe countries, to mittigate and vnfolde all griefes, and to remoue all vniuſt tributes, and ioyntly therewith did write ſuche and ſo good woordes, that at the inſtant thoſe Barbarians left their armour, and did yeld their countries vnto the obedience of Rome.
               
               Of this example, all mightie Princes haue to take example, to the ende, that with furie they vndertake not to tame a furious people: becauſe manye times, hartes be more tamed with ſwéete woordes then with cruell armes.
               
                  The Iewes that were in the prouince of Pentapolis, alſo he did repreſſe and tame, which was don by the hands of the preſident that was in Aſſyria, whom he commaunded firſt to offer them peace before he made them warre. In Achaia and Aegypt alſo certeine people did rebell: vnderſtanding the occaſion to procéede of the Romaine Pretors, whiche were rigorous in their commaundements, and couetous in their dealings, gaue order, that his officers were chaſtiſed and the people pardoned.
               The Pretors that were reſident in the countries of the Alanes, ſent to complaine at Rome, howe daily they were threatened to be ſlaine, onely for demaunding tribute: vnto whome Antoninus aunſwered. We haue receiued your letters, and be grieued with your perils, and no leſſe ſorrowe your trauailes: if theſe people do paye their tribute which they doe owe: ſuffer their threateninge which they make: becauſe it is néedeleſſe to thinke that any man which is a tributarie, ſhall liue contented. In any wiſe, aduenture not to giue them iniurious woordes, to committ briberie, or to do them wrong: becauſe in ſuche caſes, wée haue to heare their complaintes, and to correct your offences. The Gods haue you in keeping, and guide well your Fortune.
               
            
            
               CHAP. II. ¶Howe he did viſite the officers of his common wealth, and the reformation of his houſe.
               WHen Antoninus ſent any Pretor to gouerne any prouince, he was not ſatiſfied that he were wiſe, prudent, and valiaunt: but alſo without any infection of pride, or couetouſneſſe: for he helde opinion, that he may euill gouerne a common wealthe, that is a

ſubiect to pride or couetouſneſſe.
Vnto Pretours, Cenſours, and Queſtours, before he gaue them any gouernement of any countrie, firſt, he cauſed them to giue an inuentorie, of their owne proper goods: to the end that when their charge were finiſhed, the increaſe of their wealth might be conſidered: and ioyntly therewith he did both ſay and warne them, that he ſent them to miniſter iuſtice, and not by fraude to rob countries. In all thinges that Antoninus commaunded, prouided, and chaſtiſed, he was very pitifull: ſuch excepted, as did offend in the execution of iuſtice: with whom he was both rigorous &amp; extreme: in ſuch wiſe, that other offences, were they very great, he did pardon them: but as concerning iuſtice, the ſmalleſt offence was grieuouſly puniſhed. On a time certaine officers of his treaſure, brought him a memoriall: wherein was conteined the manner and fourme, yearely to increaſe his rents, which being ſéene and read, in the backe thereof, he did write theſe wordes: the order and fourme that you haue to ſearche, ought not to be to the augmentation of my rents: but for the aduancement of my common welth: eyther to impoſe newe tributes, but to deuiſe with order, to auoyde exceſſiue expences: for if Romaine Princes vſe no rule to moderate their charges, eyther we ſhall loſe our ſelues, or rob our common wealthes. Amongeſt all the Princes paſt, onely Antoninus did neuer permit, the rents of his eſtate, eyther more or leſſe to be augmented: but rather did pardon many common wealthes, of their olde debts, and alſo relieued others of ſome newe impoſitions.
Preſents that were brought him, of ſiluer, golde, ſilke, purple, iuels, or other riche things, he woulde not receiue them, were it not of the kings that payde tribute vnto the Empire: for he helde opinion, that the common wealthes, rather then him ſelfe, had néede thereof. The things that he vſed moſt commonly to receiue, were bookes to reade in, horſſes to runne, and fruite to féede on: which he forgate not, gratefully to recompence. In affaires he vſed great expedition, that is to ſay, that if he

once did vndertake any buſineſſe, he neuer withdrewe his
hand, vntill it were finiſhed. Euery yeare he cauſed his houſe to be viſited, as concerning exceſſiue expences: if exaction or briberie were committed by any of his houſhold, againſt ſtraungers: if they did ſerue, which receiued wages: if amongeſt them, there were any that were notably vicious: finally, all that whiche the viſitour for the remedie hereof did ſet downe, preſently was perfourmed.
For the time of Domitian, the Emperours officers had a cuſtome, to receiue many &amp; chargeable fées of al men, that by warrant of the Princes liberalitie receiued reliefe: which the Emperour Antoninus, as a vile cuſtome, did vtterly take away: affirming, that a gratious rewarde, ought gratis to be diſpatched. The pryde, the preſumption, the hautineſſe, and alſo the tediouſneſſe of the whole Empire, he brought, placed, and reſtored vnto the plat of great humilitie: in ſuche wiſe, that as eaſily they diſpatched affaires, with the Emperour Antoninus, as with a citizen of Rome. A matter ſurely to be noted, to beholde the Court of Rome, in the dayes of this good Prince, howe perfect the refourmation thereof was eſtabliſhed: for ſurely, whether their affaires, were eyther with the Prince, or with the Senate, neyther did they beginne their ſuit with
feare, or were diſpatched, with iuſt cauſe to murmur. The officers of his houſe, and alſo of the Senate, by whoſe handes matters were diſpatched, ſome he aduaunced, and to others he gaue double fée: to no other ende, but to remoue them from aduenturing to take any bribe.
Being (as he was) a great friend vnto the common wealth, and not a little delighted to be in the grace thereof, and to this ende, with the good he vſed great liberalitie, and with the euill great clemencie: in ſuch wiſe, that of all men he was beloued, and alſo prayſed: as well for that he pardoned the one, as gaue vnto the other. All that euer he ſayde or wiſhed, to be vſed of good Princes, the ſame did he perfourme after he was Emperour: and refourmed all things, that he thought were to be amended.
               
                  
                  In the third yeare of his Empire, Fauſtine his dearely beloued wife dyed, in whoſe death he did vtter ſo great ſorrowe, that it exceeded the authoritie of his eſtate, and alſo the grauitie of his perſon. In the memorie of Fauſtine, he placed hir picture in all the temples, and perfourmed with the Senate, that ſhe ſhould be recounted amongeſt the Goddeſſes, which was, as to canonize hir: all whiche was truely agréed by the Senate, more at the requeſt of Antoninus, then for the deſeruings of Fauſtine.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. VIII. Of certaine notable buildings erected by Antoninus.
               THe buildings which he made were not many, but excéeding ſtately and ſumptuous: for in them appeared and were repreſented the greatnes of his eſtate, and the magnanimitie that he had in ſpending. He built a temple in the reuerence of his Lorde Adrian: wherein he erected a picture of ſiluer, with a Coronet of golde, and a chaplet of Nacre: a worke moſt certainly, no leſſe curious then coſtly. He reedified a certaine building, called Gregoſtaſens: which ſerued to lodge all ſtraunge ambaſſadours: bycauſe the Romaines did vſe to giue ambaſſadours, an houſe to dwell in, and a ſtipend for their dyet. He did amplifie and nobilitate the ſepulchre of his Lord Adrian: wherevnto none durſt approch, but on their knées. The greateſt ſeſſion houſe of al Rome, was burnt in the time of Domitian: which the good Antoninus, built from the foundation. He built the temple of Agrippa, and indued and dedicated the ſame, in the reuerence of the Goddeſſe Ceres. Ouer the riuer Rubicon, he built a ſumptuous and a ſtately bridge, and alſo not a little neceſſarie: bycauſe afore time many were there daungered, and aftewardes that way muche victuall, and prouiſion was carried.
               
                  Not farre diſtant from the port of Hoſtia, neare vnto the ſea, he built a right ſtrong tower, for the ſafetie and defence of the ſhips of Rome: which a foretime might not bring in any victuall or other prouiſion, but were diſtreſſed of pyrates. The hauen or port of Gaieta, whiche had bene long through great antiquitie forſaken, he freſhly reedified, that is to ſay, built newe houſes, erected a mightie tower, made a ſtrong wall, placed inhabitants, and gaue them great priuileges: in ſuch wiſe, that whereas afore time, it was a thing vtterly forgotten, it was from thence foorth moſt eſtéemed. That whiche he did in Gaieta, he perfourmed in a porte of Spaine named Taragon: whiche he reedified, &amp; amplified, with great buildings and priuileges. A myle from the port of Hoſtia, he built a ſumptuous and a curious bathe, and indued the ſame in ſuche manner, that in all Italie it was the onely bath, that was vnto all
men frée without charges. A myle without Rome he built thrée temples, naming them Laurianos, for that many bay trées grewe there, to this ende: that the dames and matrones of Rome, walking according vnto their manner, ſhould encounter with ſome Church to pray in.
               
            
            
               CHAP. IX. Of certaine lawes which the Emperour Antoninus Pius made.
               IT was a law amongſt the Romaines, that ſuch as were put to death by iuſtice, might make no teſtament: but that in looſing their life, they loſt alſo their goods. Antoninus moued with pietie, did ordein, that none for any fault, what ſo euer, ſhould ioyntly looſe both life and goods: but if any were put to death, he might frankly make a teſtament of his owne proper goods. Where he had placed any good and ſound Iudge in any common wealth: he did not onely permit him not to be remoued: but alſo with giftes and requeſtes he did ſuſteine him. This good Prince made a law,

that none ſhould preſume to ſue to the Prince or Senate, for the office of iuſtice: vppon paine to be baniſhed Rome. There was in Rome a Iudge, named Gaius Maximus, who in Rome continued a iudge twentie yeares: of whom Antoninus wold oft ſay, that he had neuer ſéene, heard, or read of a man more cleare of life, eyther right in iuſtice. In the place of Gaius Maximus, there ſuccéeded Tatius Succinus, a man ſurely of many hoare haires, and of muche learning: but the office of Pretour being ſo tedious, and he of yeares ſo auncient, dyed immediately vpon the burthen thereof. Antoninus being infourmed, that the good olde Tatius dyed with the burthen of his office, diuided the ſame betwixt Cornelius, and Repentinus: but after the Emperour being infourmed, howe the Senate had giuen the ſame vnto Repentinus, not for his deſeruing, but at the ſuite of a Gentlewoman of the Courte: he commaunded him publikely to be baniſhed, declaring by the voice of a cryar throughout all Rome, that he was baniſhed for obteining the office of a Iudge, by the ſuit of a woman. This was the firſt officer of Rome, that in the dayes of Antoninus, ſuffered puniſhment, which correction gaue ſo greate feare throughout the Romaine Empire, that from thencefoorth the Emperour Antoninus was as muche feared of the euill, as beloued of the good.
A mightie Senatour named Tranquillus, confeſſing to haue procured his fathers death, of extreme deſire to inherite: he commaunded to be remoued into an Iſland, onely to paſſe his life with the breade of ſorrowe, and the water of teares. All the time of his Empire, he gaue wheate and oyle vnto the citizens of Rome.
                  
The people of Rome in thoſe dayes, being giuen to drinke wine without meaſure: he commaunded that none ſhuld preſume to ſel wine, but in Apothecaries ſhops for the ſicke or diſeaſed. He eſtabliſhed a lawe for him ſelf and his ſucceſſours, that openly thrée dayes in the wéeke, they ſhould ſhewe them ſelues in Rome: and if by any weightie cauſe, there happened ſome impediment, that on ſuche dayes their gates ſhould ſtand wide open, without

porters, that fréely the poore might repaire to follow their ſuits. In deare yeres he did ordeine through Italie, that no gardener ſhould dare to ſowe in his garden any féede, but wheate and barley: whereby the poore of the common wealthe might be relieued of their penurie. He made an vniuerſall lawe, throughout the Empire, that gouerners and rulers of the people, ſhould not aduenture to ſpende the goods of the common wealth, in matters eyther vnprofitable or ſuperfluous: but to the defence of enimies, or repayring of fortifications, eyther elſe for prouiſion of the common wealth in time of deare yeares. There was in Rome certaine ſtipendarie interpreters of all languages, to manifeſt the meaning of ſtraunge ambaſſadours: whoſe fée and office Antoninus commanded to be forbidden, and taken away, affirming it to be verie conuenient vnto the greatneſſe and maieſtie of Rome, that al nations and kingdomes ſhould learne to ſpeake their ſpeache: and that it were abaſement for them, to learne any ſtraunge toung.
Alſo he did ordeine, that al the old, impotent, &amp; blind people in Rome, ſhould be ſuſteined at the charges of the common wealth: but ſuch as were younger and more able, ſhoulde be conſtrained, eyther to boult meale at the bakers, or to blowe the bellowes at the ſmythes.
By chaunce on a certaine day, he founde an olde ſeruitour, whiche he had knowne long in the warres, rubbing and clawing him ſelfe againſt the pillers of the Churche: Adrian demaunding why he did ſo rubbe him ſelfe, and weare out his clothes: the olde man made anſwere, I haue no garments to clothe my ſelfe, neyther any man giueth me to eate: yet if it may pleaſe thée, Adrian, I haue founde meane to rub my ſelfe. Adrian tooke great compaſſion of that whiche he did ſée, but much more of that which he heard: and preſently he commaunded goods to be giuen him, and ſlaues to ſerue him. And as enuie, is naturall vnto the poore, as pryde is common among the riche: The next day other two poore men came before Adrian, rubbing them ſelues amongſt the pillers, in hope to receiue the like liberalitie:

whom he willed to be called vnto him, commaunding the one to ſcratch the other, and by turne to eaſe each other of his itch. Vnto king Pharaſmaco of the Parthians, Adrian gaue great giftes: that is to ſay, fiftie Eliphants armed with their towers, and thrée hundred men of Hiberin in the countrie of Spaine, which were of his guard.
            
            
               CHAP. XI. Of the prodigious and monſtruous things that happened during the Empire of Antoninus.
               MAny trauels and hard aduentures followed the Emperour Antoninus while he liued, and alſo in all his kingdomes, in the time of his reigne: bicauſe Fortune is ſo variable, that ſhe neuer ſtayeth her wheele, or euer ceaſeth to be turning thereof.
                  In the ſecond yeare of his reigne, hunger was ſo great, ſo ſharpe, and ſo generall throughout all Italie, that thereof there dyed no leſſe, then if it had bene of a fierce peſtilence. There was in Aſia, ſo cruell, and ſo generall an earthquake, that many houſes and buildings were ſubuerted, many people ſlayne, and not a fewe cities diſinhabited: for the repayring of which great hurtes, he ſent not onely money from the common wealth of Rome, but alſo plentifully ſent his treaſure out of his owne coffers. In the moneth of Ianuarie, there was in Rome ſo furious a fire, that it burnt ten thouſand houſes, wherein there periſhed of men, women, and children, more then tenne thouſande. In the ſame yeare was burnt the ſtately place of Carthage, the one halfe of Antioche, and in a manner the whole citie of Narbona. In the moneth of Auguſt, there was at Rome great floudes: and beſides, loſſe of their corne, both reapt and vnreapt. The riuer Tyber did ſo ſwell and ouerflowe, that one dayes loſſe was not repayred in thrée yeares. On the fourth of the monethe of Maie, there appeared a ſtarre ouer Rome, conteyning the quantitie of the whéele of a myll:

which threw out ſparkes ſo thicke and ſo continuall, that it ſéemed rather the fire of a forge, then the ſhining of a ſtarre. In the ſixt yeare of the Empire of Antoninus, in Rome was borne a childe with two heades, the one like a man, the other like a dogge: but the ſtraungeneſſe of the matter did more excéede, in that, with one head he did cry and barke, as a whelpe: and with the other did wéepe as a childe. In the citie of Capua, a woman was brought a bed and deliuered of fiue ſonnes. At that time was ſéene in Arabia, a great and a moſt huge ſerpent: which being ſéene of many perſons, vpon the height of a rocke, did eate halfe his owne tayle: in which yeare, there was throughout all Arabia, &amp; maruellous greate peſtilence. In the ninthe yeare of the Empire of Antoninus, in the citie of Meſia, barley was ſéene to growe in the heads of their trées: in ſuch wiſe, that no trée bare fruite that yeare, but eares of of barley. In the ſame yeare, there happened in the kingdome of Artenitos, in a citie named Triponia: foure wilde and vnknowne Lions to lye downe in the market place: which became ſo tame, that they made them packehorſſe to the mountaines for wood, and boyes became horſſemen vppon their backes. In the kingdome of Mauritania, a childe was borne, which had the heade turned backwards, which liued, and was bred vp, and alſo ſuche as would eyther ſée or ſpeake with him, moſt conueniently did place them ſelues at his backe: which notwithſtanding, coulde both ſée, ſpeake, and go, but with his hands might not féede him ſelfe. There died in Rome a Senatour, named Rufus, a man of great wealth and credite, whiche after his death did many times come to the Senate: ſitting in his wonted place, and clad with garments, after his olde faſhion, but was neuer hearde ſpeake one worde: and this viſion continued in the Senate, full two yeares.
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. XI. Of the warres that happened in the reigne of Antoninus Pius, and other his actes.
               IT chaunced vnto no Romaine prince, as it did vnto Antoninus: which alwayes remaining within the bounds of Italie, and commonly within Rome, was ſo beloued, feared, and ſerued of all ſtraunge kings and kingdomes, as if perſonally he viſited &amp; had conquered thē. In the fourth yeare of his empire, king Pharaſmaco came to Rome, but onely to ſée Antoninus, and brought and preſented vnto him, ſo muche and ſo maruellous thinges, that the eyes of men were not ſatiſfied in beholding, eyther their hearts in wiſhing them. The king of Parthians, had taken awaye much landes from the king of Armenia: who ſent to complaine vnto the Romaines, as vnto their friends, alies, and confederates: for whome the Emperour Antoninus did write his letters vnto the king of Parthians, to ceaſe to do wrong, and alſo to make reſtitution vnto the Armenians: whoſe letters being receiued and read, was preſently obeied and perfourmed. King Abogarus one of the mightieſt and moſt notable kinges of the Orient, the Emperour Antoninus did force to come to Rome: bycauſe that owing a great ſumme of money vnto one of his vaſſals, he would not come to account. The good Emperour Traiane, had conſtrained the Parthians to receiue their ſeate and royall crowne, at the handes of the Romaines: which ſubiection, the Parthians both denyed and refuſed: but Antoninus not only by letters, but alſo by apparant threatnings, did force them to yealde and conſent vnto the obedience of Rome. Rometalce king of the Pindaroes, was accuſed in ye Senate, of diſloyaltie vnto the Romaines, in the warres they helde againſt the Rhodes: who cōming vnto Rome, to quite him ſelfe, the good Antoninus did not onely confirme him in his kingdome: but alſo did not permit, that

for any thing paſt, any motion ſhould be made: affirming that his offence might not be ſo great, but that his ſubmiſſiue apparance did reforme the ſame. The Olbiopolites a people in Aſia, held warre with ye 
                  Taurociſtes, alies of Rome: vnto whom Antoninus ſente ſuccour by ſea, and with aſſiſtance of the Romanes, ſubdued the Olbiopolites, who not only paid all charges of the warres, but alſo gaue hoſtages to maintaine peace. Antoninus neuer raiſed warre, but that firſt he ſought to conſerue peace, and praiſed not a little that ſaying of Scipio: that is to ſay, Hee rather wiſhed the life of one citizen of Rome, thē the death of a thouſand enimies. When hée married his daughter Fauſtina vnto Marcus Aurelius, he made a ſūptuous feaſt, and gaue great rewards vnto his men of warre. He held his ſonne Marcus Aurelius in great reuerence, and would haue made 
                     •
                  im Conſul, which hee refuſed, holding it for more happie, to turne bookes, then to appeaſe nations.
               After he had ſent vnto Calcedonie for the great Philoſopher Apollonius, and had giuen him an houſe to dwell in ſolitarilie, neare vnto the riuer Tiber: Antoninus ſent for him, who refuſing to come ſent anſweare, That ſchollers do vſe to come to their maiſters, and not maiſters vnto their ſcholers: whereat Antoninus laughing ſaid: A trim ieſte, that Apollonius hath paſte ſo many ſeas, from Calcedonie vnto Rome, and now refuſeth from his houſe to come to mine. Although Apollonius were learned in Philoſophie, yet was hée in his life very couetous: whereat when certaine in preſence of the Emperour did murmur, hée aunſweared: for very deare that Philoſophers ſell vs their Philoſophie: alwayes their ſcience is more worthe which they teach vs, then the goodes which wée giue them.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XII. ¶ Of the ſucceſſion of the Empire, and the occaſion of his death.
               AS ye Emperour Antoninus in his youth was alwayes a frend vnto the vertuous, euen ſo in his age carefully hée did ſéeke the conuerſation of the wiſe: and therewith had no leſſe care of publique matters, then of his owne priuate affaires. Generally hée was ſo liked and loued of al nations, that in all temples, in all walles, gates, and buildings, theſe foure letters were placed, namely V.A.C.R. whiche is to ſaye Vita Antonini Conſeruatur Respublica: which is to ſaye, On the life of Antoninus, the whole weale of the Romane Empire dependeth. Leauing a part many good lawes, which he made for the Common wealth, for which purpoſe, hee had alwayes attendant about him, men in the lawes ſingularly learned, who among ye chiefe was Vindemius Verus, Siluius Valente, Aboluſius Metianus, Vlpius Marcellus, and Iabolinus: before whome hée ſet the lawes of all kingdomes, and of the moſt neceſſarie and approued, to take the choice to be eſtabliſhed in his kingdomes. When he did inſtitute any lawe, either ordeine any proclamation, he alwayes expreſſed therein ſo great reaſon, that his commaundements were neuer diſobeyed, either his lawes reuoked.
The cauſe of his death they ſay was after this maner: from Gallia Tranſalpina, that is to ſay, ſwéete Fraunce, they did preſent him certaine chéeſes, whereof he eating at his ſupper more then was conuenient, they miniſtred vnto him a perillous vomit, whereby they diſcharged his ſtomache not onely of meate ſuperfluous, but alſo of bloud righte neceſſarie, which bredd in him a furious feuer, and finding himſelfe

in great weakneſſe, without diſpoſition to ſléepe, either appetite to eate: he commaunded al the Senatours and chief gouernours, to be called vnto his preſence: and before thē all did commende the common wealth vnto Marcus Aurelius his ſonne, and Fauſtine his daughter. And making his teſtament in verie good order, wherin he gaue vnto his ſeruants great gifts, which being finiſhed and perfourmed, he gaue vnto his daughter Fauſtine, the inheritaunce of all his lands which he poſſeſſed before he came vnto the Empire. His feauer increaſing, and his ſtrength and life waſting, the fourth day of his ſickneſſe about noone, beholding and viewing all the circumſtants, and ſhutting his eyes as if he would ſléepe, gaue vp the ghoſt: who was no leſſe bewailed at his death, then he was beloued in time of life: and preſently by conformitie of the whole Senate, was intituled Holie: and all the people at the newes of his death, a vie in euery ſtreate did grite, ſkrich, and cry, aduauncing and magnifying his bountie, clemencie, benignitie, liberalitie, iuſtice, patience, prudence, and prouidence. Al the honours were done vnto him, and all the famous titles were giuen him, that vpon any noble Prince had bene imployed. And deſerued that in the temple of Iupiter, a prieſt of his owne name ſhould be inſtitute. Alſo they built him a temple, and dedicated vnto his honour the Circene playes, and a fraternitie: where they were all called Antonines. This Prince onely amongeſt all Princes, liued and dyed without ſheading of bloude: and for likelineſſe, compared vnto Numa Pompilius, not onely in good gouernement of the common wealth, but alſo for ſinceritie of life.

               CHAP. I. ¶ Of the byrth of the Emperour Commodus,
               
                  THe Emperour Commodus had to his grandfather Annius Verus, and his father was the good Emperour Marcus Aurelius: and his mother was the right faire and renouned Fauſtine: on whoſe ſide, he was nephewe vnto the Emperour Antoninus Pius, a man of a refourmed life, and very beneficiall vnto the common wealth of Rome. He was borne in a certaine place named Lodie, on the eight day of September: at the time that his father, and Druſius his vnckle, were Conſuls: the one gouerning matters of warre in Datia, and the other in refourmation of cauſes in the common wealth. The Empreſſe Fauſtine being great with childe, and neare vnto the time of her childe byrth, dreamed that ſhe was deliuered of certaine ſerpents, but eſpecially of one, more fierce then the reſt: of which dreame, when his father Marcus Aurelius was infourmed, they ſay, that he ſayde: I feare me Fauſtine, that the ſonne of this birth, ſhall proue ſo fierce a Serpent, that ſhall be of power to commit a murther of our fame, and to poyſon the whole common wealth of Rome. The Aſtronomers and Nekromantiques, which in thoſe dayes were

reſident in Rome, they ſayde and prognoſticated many things of the byrth of the Emperour Commodus: and as it appeared afterwardes they ſayde very little, in reſpect of that which followed: bycauſe this miſerable and vnfortunate Prince, in his manners, did rather reſemble the infernall furies, then reaſonable creatures. From his infancie his father Marcus Aurelius, carefully did trauell, in the learning and inſtruction of his ſonne Commodus: for whiche purpoſe, he made inquiſition throughout the whole Empire, for men learned in ſcience, and of life and manners refourmed. His firſt ſcholemaiſters were, Oneſicrates to teach him Gréeke, Capilus to inſtruct him in the Latine, Teyus to inſtruct him in the Art of Oratorie, Pulion to infourme him in Muſike, Calphurnius to giue him order for behauiour on horſbacke, and Marcius to giue him rules for good manners: for that his father hauing no more ſonnes, did not a little trauell, to frame in him ſuche perfection, as was due vnto a moſt noble and perfect Prince. But alas for pitie, that ſo many and ſo excellent men, neyther could perſuade him to followe or imbrace vertue, eyther ſeperate him from his deteſtable vices. Right happie may we call thoſe fathers, whoſe hap is to haue children inclined to vertue: for if they naturally be euill inclined, neyther doth it profite, that whiche their maiſters teach them, eyther wherefore their parents
                  do correct them. 
                  After Fauſtine was conceiued with Commodus, ſhe neuer ceaſſed to ſay, howe painefull he was in bréeding, and howe daungerous in his birth: and his nourſes for his byting when he did ſucke, alwayes complained: in ſuche wiſe, that from the time of his firſt conception he was painefull, and tedious in conuerſation. After Commodus was weined, and began to féede him ſelf and learne to talke: preſently it appeared, that he was harde of condition, intollerable to ſerue, ingrateful of benefites, a glutton in féeding, malicious in countenaunce, cruell in reuengement, impatient in iniuries, proude in commaundements, and aboue all, filthy, double, and vncertaine in his

talke. At the ſixte yeare of his age, it was maruellous to ſée howe in ſo tender yeares, he was giuen to all manner of vice: that none whatſoeuer in times paſt, had vſed ſuch induſtrie to proue eyther valiant or learned, as the vnfortunate Commodus did trauell to be vicious. He was ſharpe and of a delicate wit, and of excellent memorie: he was alſo, quarelling, valiaunt, and doughtie: moſt apparant in him from his infancie: for he was neuer ſéene to feare eyther water, or fire, ſworde, or wilde beaſtes. Nature alſo had indued him with naturall abilities, whiche valiauntneſſe if he had imployed in warres, eyther his memorie vnto learning, or his wit vnto vertues, he might haue proued an other Alexander in proweſſe: or Plato in ſcience, eyther Traiane in iuſtice: but by euill conuerſation, he rightly reſembled Brute the traytour, Nero the cruell, and Catiline the tyrant.
               
            
            
               CHAP. II. Of the honourable titles, giuen vnto the Emperour Commodus, in time of his youth.
               NOtwithſtanding that Commodus was as yet but young, he was ouerthwart, quarellous, hatefull, and generally of the people not well liked. At the age of fourtene yeares, the Senate gaue him the title of Caeſar: not for the merite of the ſonne, but to yealde to the vertue of the father. The Emperour Marcus Aurelius, ſéeing his ſonne increaſe in age, and decreaſe in vertue, aduiſed to place him in a college of prieſtes, with whom many ſonnes of noble men were bred: but in the end, he as little profited, by the companie of prieſtes, as by the doctrine of his ſcholemaiſters: for he helde alwayes, enimitie with other mens counſell, and great friendſhip with his owne will. When his father came from the Parthike warres, in token of gratefulneſſe, the Senate gaue vnto Commodus the title of Prince: which name vnto that day, was neuer giuen vnto the ſonne of any Emperour.
               
                  The Romaine Princes held a cuſtome, yearely to giue vnto the people for their ſuſtentation, wheate, wine, and oyle, and other thinges, on which day alwayes in Rome they made great feaſtes. Commodus being then of fiftene yeares of age, and alſo placed in the temple of Traiane, gaue and diuided vnto the people, their accuſtomed ſhares of wheate, oyle, and wine: on that day Commodus was ſo feaſted of all the Senate, as his father was the day he entered triumphing into Rome. When the Emperour Marcus Aurelius came from the warres of the Argonautes, he was receiued into Rome with great triumphe: and the more to honour and to do him pleaſure, the Senate did ordeine, that his ſonne Commodus, ſhould with him be placed, in the chariot triumphant: &amp; further &amp; beſide this, they did inueſt him with the garment imperiall: that is to ſay, they did abilitate and elect him, that after the death of his father, his ſonne Commodus ſhould be Emperour. Marcus Aurelius went into Aegypt, and alſo into Aſſyria, to viſite thoſe countries, and lead with him his ſonne Commodus. The Senate vnderſtanding the noble works and déedes which he performed in al thoſe countries and prouinces, ſent him a diſpenſatiō of the law Annuaria, which did prohibite, that no young man might be admitted to be Conſul: to the end that fréely he might eſtabliſh his ſonne Commodus, Romaine Conſul. Commodus was but xvij. yeares of age, when he ſawe him ſelfe clad with the imperiall garment, when he diuided ſhares of reliefe vnto the common people, when he was elected a Romaine Conſul, and was placed with his father in the chariot triumphant: which foure titles and honours, were not giuen to honour the ſonne, but to pleaſe the father. His proportiō was after
this manner: his body long and ſlender, his face faire and well bearded, his eyes great and blacke, his handes white and long fingred, his haire yellow &amp; thicke: finally, he was ſo faire and ſo gratious, that in his perſon there was no blemiſh, either in his life any thing to be prayſed.
               
               
                  It was monſtrous and alſo lamentable to ſée, howe

this Prince was naturally endued with ſo high a witt, and of ſuch perfect ſingularitie of proportion, and further, being named Commodus, howe to all purpoſes, he was incommodious, that according to the iudgement of al mē, he was not onely vnworthie of ſo great and ſingular graces, but poſſeſſed his life with great indignitie.
               
               
                  
                     Commodus had his lockes ſo perfect yelow, that when they were moued in the ſunne with the ayre, they ſéemed not hayres, but thredes of golde: and many helde opinion, conſidering the incomparable beautie &amp; fineneſſe of his perſon, and the liuely freſheneſſe of his face, that he had not béene ingendred by mankinde, but that the Gods had made him with their owne handes. At all times when he did ride through Rome, a vie both men &amp; womē left their buſineſſe, placing them ſelues at windowes, vppon houſes, and all ſtréetes, to beholde him, as though they had neuer ſéene him: but as much as they praiſed him for his beautie: ſo muche did they diſpraiſe and abhorre him for his wicked life. Commodus was farre out of fauour with his father Marcus Aurelius, and too muche cheriſhed of his mother Fauſtine: wherein bothe the one and the other had great reaſon: for doubtleſſe, he gathered too ſmall profite of his fathers counſell, and folowed too much the libertie of his mother.
                  Commodus had another brother named Veriſsimus, vnto whome, if he had not dyed young, the father had left the Empire: but ſo the deſtinies did ordeine, that he died which deſerued to liue, and that he liued which deſerued to dye. When in the preſence of Marcus Aurelius, talke was moued of Princes that had béene honourable and happye: ſome praiſing Alexander, that ouercame Darius: others, Scipio that ſubdued Haniball: others, Iulius Caeſar that conquered Pō
                     peius: others, Auguſtus that defeated Marcus Antonius: Marcus Aurelius made this aunſwer: I holde the Emperour Nerua more happie then all the reſt, and for no other cauſe, but for that he adopted Traiane for his ſonne, in ſuch wiſe, that he elected whome he liked, and

not as I moſte ſorrowful, that muſt take ſuch as they haue giuen mee.
               
            
            
               CHAP. III. ¶Howe Commodus did inherite the Empire of his father Marcus Aurelius, and of a certeine ſpeech which he vſed vnto the Senate.
               JN the xvi. yere of the reigne of Marcus Aurelius, and in the 63. yere of his age, warre was raiſed in Panonia, which at theſe dayes is otherwiſe named Hungarie: in which warres the good Emperour woulde goe in his owne perſon, leading alſo with him his ſonne Commodus, according vnto his accuſtomed manner, that by the taſte of trauels in the warres, he ſhould bende and yelde him ſelfe to conſerue peace. The Emperour in the greateſt heate and furie of thoſe martiall affaires, was ſoudeinly ſtriken with a deadly ſickneſſe, and in fewe dayes depriued of his life: Commodus being then in ſo tender yeares, that he neither felt what he loſt, either the daunger wherin he ſtoode. At the death of Marcus Aurelius, his ſonne Commodus was elected Prince, and confirmed Caeſar, whereof procéeded (but chiefely for affection they bare vnto his father) that preſently he was obeyed of all the armies, as true Emperour: notwithſtanding they all ſuſpected, he ſhould be the loſſe of their common wealth, and procure to his perſon ſome euil concluſion. Before the emperour Aurelius died, he left his ſonne Commodus commended vnto certeine tutours, as well fortunately to finiſhe thoſe warres begonne, as alſo to aſſiſt and counſell him in the gouernement of the common wealth, becauſe ye father comprehending the ſonne, did feare, that leauing ye enimies, he would abandon him ſelfe vnto vices: and although the common wealth were forgotten, would dedicate him ſelfe vnto the pleaſures of his perſon.
               
                  The exequies for the good Prince Marcus Aurelius being celebrated, and ſumptuous ſacrifices alſo offered for him vnto the Gods, Commodus was aduiſed by his coū
                  ſell, to vſe ſome ſpeache vnto all his Senatours, and captaines attendant in thoſe warres: who being aduaunced vppon an high ſkaffolde, began after this manner to make his Oration.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           The Oration of Commodus made to the Senate.
                           
                           The vniuerſall calamitie, and the particular ſorrowe, which for the death of my father, this ſorrowfull day doth repreſent, is no leſſe common vnto you then to mee: for if I haue loſt a pittifull father, you haue loſt a righteous and a iuſt Prince. My loſſe is not ſmall, that haue loſt ſuch a father, but much more haue you loſt, that haue loſt ſuch a Prince: becauſe the hurte of one is tollerable, but that which redoundeth to the offence of many, for euer is to be lamented. Experience teacheth vs, that of an hundred fathers, there be not twaine, that are euill vnto their children: and by the contrarie, of an hundreth princes, ye ſhall hardly finde twaine, that exquiſitely ſhal proue good for their ſubiectes. If this be true, as it is moſte true, that I haue ſaide: it is iuſt, and verie iuſt, that if ſonnes lament the death of their parentes, with teares of their eyes: that ſubiectes bewaile the death of their good Princes, with drops from their heartes.
                           Howe humble my father hath beene vnto the Gods, how ſeuere with ye wicked, howe affable with good men, how patient in iniuries, how grateful for

ſeruice, howe bountifull in his houſe, and howe zealous for the common wealth: although you haue ſeene, you haue not throughly comprehended: for that good Princes be not exactly knowen, vntil they be loſt. My father was ſo fortunate and venturous in the warres, ſo ſingular in ſcience, ſo ſincere and cleane of life, and ſo perfecte a louer of the common wealth, that the dead had enuie at the liuing, not of the life which they poſſeſſed, but of the Prince which they inioyed. It may not be denied, but that the Romaine Empire is in debt and beholding vnto many Princes paſt: but I ſaye and affirme, that Rome is more in debt vnto my father, aboue all other: for others made the common wealth riche, but my father made it vertuous: others repaired walles, but he reformed manners: and that which is more, others brought to paſſe that Rome was feared of all ſtrange nations: but my father framed, that Rome of all in generall was both ſerued and beloued. You all well vnderſtande, what difference there goeth betwixt voluntarie, and forceable ſeruice: for as my father did vſe to ſaye, it is more tollerable to be commaunded of ſuche as loue vs, then to be ſerued of ſuch as abhorre vs. My father hath now finiſhed his iourney, and certeinly, moſte perfectly hath runne out his race: herein ye may conceiue his ineſtimable loue towardes you, in that he commended mee his onely ſonne into your handes: and if I followe and perfourme his will, he gaue mee not the Empire to commaund you, but to the ende I ſhould ſerue you, for he expreſſely gaue in charge, that my Empire ſhould tende more to your vtilitie, then to mine owne profite, humbly beſeeching the immortal Gods, to make

mee ſuch, as my father at his death commaunded, &amp; as you Romaines do wiſhe and deſire: becauſe there is no man in this worlde ſo euil, that deſireth not to be gouerned by a Prince that is good. You with me, and I with you, in the manner of our gouernement after his death, he did verie well expreſſe in the time of his life, directing me by commaundement to call you fellowes, and forbidding you to call me Lord: for his deſire was, that you ſhould fauour, and counſell me as a ſonne: and that I ſhould deale with you as with brethren, and truſt &amp; beleeue you as fathers. The loue which the gods do beare vs, the ſame my father alwayes vſed with you: that is to ſay, he did ſo tenderly loue you all, as if ye all had beene but one man: whereof it foloweth that you are not ſo much in his debt, for that which he did for you, as for ye hee woulde haue done, and coulde not. I remember me, that many times being a childe, my father delighted that ye ſhould take, imbrace, kiſſe, and cheriſh me: to the end that imbracing of me in your armes, ye ſhuld place me in your hartes: and alſo, that I finding your armes open, ſhoulde not vniuſtely cloſe my bowels from you. My Empire is not as the Empire of others, yt is, I neither bought it with money, either obteined it by voices, or wonne it by armes, or toke it by guile: no doubtles, it is not ſo: for as others obteine by aduēture, naturally I inherite. You haue great reaſon in minde to be ſatiſfied, and in harte contented, ſince ye haue a prince not deliuered by the hands of ſtrangers, but borne in your owne houſes. I confeſſe that to proue good, it auaileth muche to deſire and alſo procure to be good: but ioyntly herewith I ſaye, that to be a prince, it neceſſarily requireth to haue the

fauour of his kingdome: for otherwiſe, if ſtraungers do repugne, and ſubiects do not ſuccour, it may be in his owne handes to be a good man, but not in his power to be a good Prince.
                           My father was olde, and I am yong, wherof it foloweth, yt more glorie redoundeth vnto you, by yealding obedience vnto me, then vnto my father: bicauſe obedience done vnto him, proceeded of the merit of his authoritie: but that which yee ſhall yealde vnto mee, proceedeth of your owne pure vertue. All the rewardes, honours, and offices, that my father gaue in time of his life from henceforth I confirme them vnto ſuch as hold them: for that being (as he was) both holy and vertuous, the Gods aproouing all his actes, it were not iuſt, they ſhould be diſalowed of men. Neither in the dignities of the Senate, the captainſhippes of the armies, the offices of my houſe, there is nothing to be ſayd, much leſſe to be altered: only one thing remaineth betwixt my father and mee, which is, that I confirme his good works, &amp; change my vnreformed maners. Let vs ioyntly put on noble minds, to giue good end vnto the warres whiche my father hath ſo happily begunne, which being finiſhed, wee will all goe to our eaſe and ſolace, and inioy the pleaſures of Rome: whiche warres, if wee ſhould leaue vndone, although the hurte ſhould redound to mee, the faulte ſhould proceede and be imputed vnto you. I will not ſaye more vnto you, my friendes &amp; companions, but that I requeſt and deſire you, alwayes to commend vnto your memorie, the great loue that my father hath borne you, and the good dealing he alwayes vſed with you: that from his antiquitie, my tender yeres, and your greate vertue, ye

maye frame a Prince, good for your ſelues, and profitable for the common wealth.
                           Finally, I ſaye that if ye haue my father in remē
                              braunce, ye will neuer forget or diſobey mee his ſonne: for comparing his vertue with my libertie: doubtleſſe and without compariſon, ye ſhal be much more perſuaded by his nobleneſſe, then altered by my youthfulneſſe.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  This talke being finiſhed, much money was throwen out amongeſt the armyes becauſe, on ſuch dayes, it was amongeſt the Romaines muche vſed. The Romaine Princes did not muche varie from reaſon, to giue and promiſe muche money in the beginninge of their Empires: for as muche as the malice of man is greedie and couetous: they are more perſuaded withe a little money which is giuen, then with many wordes that are ſpoken vnto them.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. IIII. ¶Of a certeine famous and notable ſpeeche, vſed by one of his tutours: for that he would leaue the warre of Panonia vnfiniſhed.
               ALl the officers of the Senate, and all the captaines of the armie did marueilouſly mitigate their ſorrowe, for the death of their moſte louing Lorde Marcus Aurelius, when they hearde his ſonne Commodus talke with ſo greate ſingularitie: not onely for that he confirmed, whatſoeuer his father had done, but alſo becauſe he promiſed by imitation moſt naturally to reſemble him.
               But what and howe great difference was betwixt the wordes of this Prince at that inſtant, &amp; the workes which after he perfourmed in his life, was muche &amp; too muche: for nothing was more aparant, then that al his good words

and woorkes, vppon that day did finiſhe and take an ende, becauſe from that day, he did not onely ſpeake euil, and do euill: but that which is woorſt of all, it was neuer ſéene, that euer he had any motion or deſire to do good. Many be wicked, and deſire to amende: but this perſon ſo vnhappie and ſolde to ſinne, was not to day ſo euil: that he deſired and procured not to morrowe to be woorſe. Certeine dayes after he had vſed this talke vnto the army, he permitted to be gouerned by the aduiſe of his tutours: but euen ſhortly after he both forgate the commaū
                  dement of his father, and his promiſe made vnto his men of warre: for that he loſt not onely the feare of his tutors, but alſo the loue and ſhame vnto his friendes. 
                     Commodus
when he did inherite the Empire, was weake, delicate, and of tender yeares: but notwithſtanding did vſe ſuch licence and libertie of life, that decayed his perſon, and damnified his inclination and manners. His tutors and gouernours finding the offence that inſued therof, aduiſed to remoue the miſchiefe by information and counſel in ſecrete: but ſo peruerſe was his condition, that for their gentle admonition, he did preſently abhorre them. Nowe when Commodus had publiquely loſt his feare vnto tutors, his obedience vnto gouernours, and reuerence vnto his friendes, he woulde neither beholde the one, or ſpeake with the other: but that all his communication, and conuerſation was with perſons light, young and vicious, vnto whome he committed all his ſecretes: who began to perſuade him to leaue the warres, to go to Rome, renuing his memorie with the opulencie of Italie, and the beautie of Rome: and ioyntly did murmur at the land of Panonia, ſaying, it was barren, drye, colde, poore, and contagious: and that to drinke a pitcher of water, they were firſt conſtrained to breake the Ice.
               
               With theſe and ſuche like woordes, Commodus was eaſily perſuaded to leaue the warres of Panonia, and take his waye into Italie: and to bring the ſame to effect, calling his tutours and gouernours into his preſence,

fained to haue greate ſuſpicion, that while he remained in ye warrs, ſome others ſhould cōſpire &amp; rebel in Rome: in reſpect whereof to avoyde ye woorſte, he was determined firſt to aſſure him ſelfe of his owne countries, before hée conquered ſtraung kingdoms. So greate ſorrowe entred the harts of the gouerners and capteines, that were preſent at that aſſemblye, that heauily caſtinge their countenaunces on the grounde, they were not able to aunſwere one woord. A Senatour named Pōpeyanus being preſent at that counſell, who had married Lucilla, daughter vnto Marcus Aurelius, and elder ſiſter vnto Commodus: beſids his aliance in marriage, he was a man both rich, wiſe, valiaunte, and aunciente: and therewithall had greate boldneſſe in that which he did, and no leſſe credit in that which he ſaide. This Conſul Pompeyanus, beholding all the aſſembly in great ſilence, thought good to take in hand, to aunſwere the Emperour Commodus after this manner.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           The Oration of Pompeyanus to Commodus.
                           
                           Oh my ſonne, and my Lord, for thee to haue deſire to ſee Rome, &amp; to go into Italie, is no meruel: for the ſame which thou deſireſt, all we haue longe wiſhed, but folowing and imbracing reaſon, we endure not to be ouercome or carried away with ſenſualitie. I call thee ſonne, becauſe I haue bred and nouriſhed thee from thy youth: and I call thee Lord, becauſe thou art Lorde of my mother Rome: by the one I am bounde as a faithfull vaſſall to followe and obeye thee, and by the other thou art bound as vnto a good father to beleeue me: and may it pleaſe the immortall gods, that thou haue as ready an harte to beleeue

my counſels, as I haue, redilie to obeye thy commaundements.
                           Many yeares I did folowe and ſerue thy father, and alſo am fully perſuaded, that my ſeruice was gratefull vnto his harte, and did not onely tenderly loue me, but alſo frankely gaue and recompenced me: for which reaſon, vnto him and his houſe I will neuer become ingratefull: and am determined, one for one to counſell thee, in that which thou oughteſt to doe, and afterwardes employ my life where in thou ſhalt cōmaund me. In that which I ſhal now ſay, if I haue not that reuerence, that from a vaſſall is due vnto the Lorde, at the leaſte I ſhall haue that loue that a father doth owe vnto his ſonne: and if nowe thou ſhalt be diſpleaſed with my words, and ſhalt take them to other ende then they be ſpoken, the time ſhall come, wherein thou ſhalt repente thee, for not beleeuing the old Pompeyanus, and that thou haſt followed thine owne will and iudgment. But comming to the purpoſe, thou ſeeſt (moſte ſouereigne prince) that all which be preſent, neither do beholde or anſwer thee, which may not proceede, but that either they knowe not to ſpeake, or dare not anſwere, or els they thinke thou wilte not beleeue them: any of which, is too muche hurtefull and daungerous: becauſe it is a faulte in a prince, to demaunde counſell of him that knoweth not to giue it: but it is muche woorſſe when they dare not ſpeake that whiche is meete to be ſaide: but that whiche is woorſte of all, is, when a prince knoweth not to take the benefite of good counſell.
                           If thou hadſt in remembraunce, what thy father commaunded, it were ſuperfluous at this preſent to

aduaunce my ſelfe to giue thee counſell: and I dread, that as thou haſte made no accompt of his commaundement, in muche leſſe eſtimation thou wilt holde my requeſt: but in the ende I will ſay my opinion, and after wardes, make choyce of what ſhall, or may pleaſe thee.
                           My ſonne, call to remembrance whoſe ſonne thou wert, that is to ſay, of my Lorde Marcus Aurelius. for if thou doeſt conſider that thou hadſt to father ſo good a father: thou art muche bounde, being his ſonne, to proue a very good ſonne. Thou dideſt inherite of thy father his houſe, his goodes, his eſtate, and his memorie: all which doubtleſſe is verie little, if thou didſt not inherite his nobleneſſe: becauſe, for thy onely vertue thou art to be honoured &amp; obeyed: as touching the reſt, as thou didſt inherite in one day thou maiſt loſe in one houre. The glorie which thou receiueſt, to haue ſo good a father, ſo neare and in companie with the Gods, the ſame ſhoulde hee haue there, to haue ſo good a ſonne here amongſt men: for other wiſe, as muche pleaſure as thou takeſt of his glorie, ſo much griefe ſhall he receiue of thy infamie.
                           Thou wilte (my ſonne) leaue this warre whiche thy father hath begonne, and wilt go to enioy the delights of Rome: I ſweare by the immortall Gods, I may not immagine ye vnworthineſſe of him that put the ſame into thy heade: becauſe ſuche and ſo greate an enterpriſe as this, ought not to be lefte vnfiniſhed, either if it were not begonne, vnperfourmed.
                           Thou mayeſt not denie, but that thy father was wiſe, aduiſed, patient, &amp; valiante, which being ſo

in my iudgmente it ſhoulde be right iuſte, that thou ſhouldeſt aduenture thy goods, where in he aduentured and alſo loſt his life. The affaires of Italie are in peace, in Rome ther is no mutinous perſon, in Aſia, &amp; Africa, there is no common wealth out of quiet: the cauſe therof procedeth, of ye great affectiō which they did beare vnto thy father: and of the greate power, yt here they vnderſtand his ſonne doth poſſeſſe, which if thou forſake, &amp; loſe therewithall ſo great reputation: thou ſhalt leaue the Barbarians in peace, and make warre againſt thy ſelf. If thou (my ſonne) wilt obteine reſt and a good life, ſuſteine and conſerue that which thy father did winne and gette in time of his life: and thou ſhalte finde, that he conquered all, wonne all, recouered all, and made all plaine: and it is not vniuſtly ſaide, that he had all: for if he conquered walles with armour, he wonne hartes with good woorkes and noble deedes. My ſonne, what wilte thou ſeeke out of Panonia, yt thou mayeſt not find in Panonia: if thou deſire to ſee Rome, I giue thee vnderſtanding, that true Rome is where the Emperour of Rome is reſident: becauſe Rome is not holden for Rome, for the ſtately walles where with it is compaſſed, but for the heroicall men wher with it is gouerned.
                           If thou wilt haue riches, behold here is ye treaſure and the collectors thereof. If thou wilt haue men of counſell, here is the whole ſacred Senate. If thou wilte haue men of noble mindes, there are none in the worlde, as thoſe of thine armie.
                           If thou wilte haue luſtie younge men of thine age, here are the ſonnes of all the noble Romaines.
                           
                              If thou wilt fiſhe, behold here the great riuer Danubic, if thou wilt hunte and chace the wilde beaſte, here are ſharpe mountaines, if thou wilte haue faire women, behold here women both of Rome and Germanie moſte beautifull. If this be true, as it is moſt true, wherefore my ſonne wilt thou departe from Rome, to go and ſeeke Rome? If vpon the ſoudaine thou leaue this warre, thou ſhalt ſtaine thy fame with a greate blemiſh, and alſo put thy common wealth in great daunger: becauſe the barbarous ſhal thinke, that thy power is not ſufficiēt to ouercome them, and alſo that thou dareſt not attempt to aſſaile them. Thy father lefte thee with greate power, and greate reputation in the Empire: and thou (my ſonne) ſhouldeſt rather bend and fixe thine eyes to conſerue thy reputation, then thy potencie: becauſe thy power only profiteth againſt thine enimies: but thy reputation profiteth to conquer enimies, &amp; to conſerue friends. And thou oughteſt not to conceiue or think that ye power of the Romaine princes is ſo great, that it lieth in their handes at their owne likinge to make warre or peace with the barbarous nations: bycauſe there is nothing wherin fortune is leſſe correſpondent then Martial affaires. The good princes ought to do muche, trauell muche, and alſo aduenture muche, to avoyde warre and to obteine peace: but after they are determined to attempt and proſecute the ſame, they ought to reſpecte nothing more then the finiſhing thereof: becauſe many euiles are cutte off, by a good warre, which may not be finiſhed or brought to paſſe with a ſuſpicious or a doubtfull peace. It is greate folly for any man to endaunger him ſelfe, onely vppon the hope of a remedie: but much more is it, when a man

hath allredie thruſte him ſelfe into daunger, not to ſeeke to eſcape the perill thereof.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. V. How Commodus left the warres of Panonia to go to Rome.
               After that Pompeyanus had ended his Oration, Commodus did ſhew him ſelfe offended, for the opening thereof in ſo common aſſembly, and pleaſed for the integritie of his woordes, giuing for an anſwere, that for the preſent he woulde deferre his departing: vntill ripe counſell, ſhould determine ſome other matter. Not withſtanding his ſmall age, he was of ſuche diſſimulation in matters he woulde bringe to paſſe, and ſo double in his words which he did ſpeake, that the aunſwere which he made, was not to the intente to ſtay his departing, but to confirme them in negligence and want of prouidence. It was publiſhed in the whole armie, what Pompeyanus had ſayd vnto Commodus, and that the departing into Italie was deferred vntill the warres were finiſhed: of which newes ſome were pleaſed, and ſome diſpleaſed: becauſe the auncient and vertuous wiſhed all thinges to be done to the honour of the common wealth: but the younger perſons and ſuche as were vitious, had deſire to go the vices of Rome. Some remaining quiet, and others negligent, Commodus determined to procéede with his purpoſe: and wrote certeine letters vnto Rome, wherin he commaunded, they ſhoulde order his houſe and prepare for his comminge: and he did alſo write, that they ſhoulde relieue him with ſome monye, for that with the warres he was much conſumed. His letters being diſpatched vnto Rome, Commodus commaunded all the valiant capteins to come vnto his preſence, with whome he did communicate the

manner and faſhion which he woulde vſe with thoſe barbarous people, to frame them to yeald to ſome honeſt truce: &amp; if a better cōcluſion might not be obteined, to finiſh the ſame with a peace dearly bought. After that meſſengers had paſſed betwixt Commodus and the Barbarians diuerſly to and fro: in the ende it was reſolued, that hee rendered many countries, that had bene taken from the enimies, and alſo gaue thē a great ſumme of money: and they promiſed to continue friendes, but not vaſſals vnto the Romaines. This concluſion being knowne and publiſhed, was not a little grieuous vnto all noble minds of the armie: becauſe moſt truely the capitulation thereof was too too infamous, that in reſpect of the ſtate of thoſe warrs it was not onely not to be done, either as much as to be talked of. Of theſe infamous concluſions, and ye paimente of ſo greate ſummes of money, he gaue no parte therof vnto ye Senate or gouernours to vnderſtande, but vnto ſuch men of warre as he vnderſtoode had deſire to be gone, and ſuch as he thought durſt not repugne. The fame beinge publiſhed that Commodus would depart towards Rome, the whole armie was ſo altered, that none would remaine in the frontiers, but that euery man without order, prepared with greate haſt to returne into Italie: in ſuch wiſe that Commodus, not onely ceaſed to continue hoſtilitie againſt ye Barbarians, but alſo left no garriſons, to guard the Romaine people. The Emperour Commodus parted from Panonia to go to Rome, ye tenth day of ye moneth of Februarie: and ſo greate was his deſire to come to Rome, that in many cities which were in his way, where they came foorth to receiue him, he would not onely ſtay to heare what they would ſay, either receiue yt which they would preſent: but alſo alone and diſguiſed, in poſte woulde paſſe theire ſtréets.
               Incredible was the pleaſure which they receiued in Rome, when Commodus did write of his partinge from Panonia: but muche greater was their ioye, when they vnderſtoode that he was at hande: for remembringe

that he was borne amongeſt them, and that they had bred and nouriſhed him, and that he was the ſonne of ſo good a father: they helde it for certeine, that in his time Rome (more then euer it did) ſhould flouriſh, and that euery man in particular, ſhould augment his eſtate. In reſpect of the greate loue and reuerence they did beare vnto the father Marcus Aurelius, and the reporte blowne amongſt the Romaines of ye ſingular beautie of his ſonne Commodus, they did ſo extremly deſire to ſée him, that he held him ſelfe moſt happy that came furtheſt off to receiue him. Marche was halfe paſt when Commodus came to Rome, at which time trées do yealde foorth their flowers, and fields their fragrant ſmelles: againſt the day that he ſhoulde enter Rome, the Romains had made all wayes euen and cleane, and banqueting houſes deckte with boughes to eate and drincke in: the Senatours came forth in great order, the women of Rome in ſumptuous apparel, &amp; the towneſmen all with boughes and greene braunches, in ſuch manner they receiued him that day with as greate pleaſure and ioy, as if he had entered in his chariote triumphant triumphinge of all Aſia. After he entred the citie, that whiche he firſte did, was, in viſitinge all the temples within the ſame: chieflye he ſtayed in ye temple of Iupiter, where he offered ſumptuous ſacrifices, all the noble men of Rome being preſent. Alſo he did viſite certaine auncient ſepulchers, eſpecially ye ſepulchre of Adrian, of Traiane, of Antoninus Pius his grandfather, of Fauſtina his grand mother, &amp; Fauſtina alſo his mother: and ſome thinges yt were in them euill handled, or decayed, he cōmaunded to be repaired and made better. Ioyning vnto the ſepulchre of Adrian, he commaunded another ſepulchre to be made, riche and ſumptuous, wherein the bones of his father Marcus Aurelius ſhoulde be tranſlated, which ſepulchre being finiſhed, and hauing in remembraunce howe greate loue Marcus Aurelius did beare them, and the good &amp; ſincere dealing he vſed with them, the Romaines did viſite, honour, and helde his ſepulchre in as greate reuerence, as

their chiefeſt temples. This done, Commodus on a day went vnto ye Senate, ſaying and giuinge them warning, that in all and for all thinges, they ſhoulde followe the ordinaunce of his father, and performe and execute all that he had commaunded them: becauſe after this manner, the imperial ſtate ſhould be conſerued as concerning ſtraunge nations: and the common wealth wel gouerned amongſt them ſelues. Alſo hee commaunded all Iudges of Rome to come before him, charginge and commaundinge them, that without all exception of perſons, equally to giue ſentence accordinge to iuſtice: with a warninge, that if any of them ſhoulde preſume to attempt the contrarie, to haue his ſentence reuoked, and his perſon chaſticed.
               The Romaines receiued greate delight, to ſée how Commodus was obedient vnto the Gods, a louer of temples, grateful vnto his friendes, and zelous of the cōmon welth: but alas for ſorrowe, ſo fewe were the monethes, and alſo the dayes, that this gratious heate endured, that it ſemed rather they had dreamed it, then that he had done or performed it.
            
            
               CHAP. VI. Howe Commodus was cruell, and of the cruelties which he vſed.
               
                  IN the nintéenth yeare of his age and the thirde yeare of his Empire, he aduertiſed the Senate, that he would viſite all the cities in Italie: at his departinge from Rome he went vnto the mountaines to hunte, on whiche chace, many were the dayes that he imployed, much mony hee ſpente, but muche and many more were the vices which he there committed.
               
               
                  Thrée monethes and odde dayes he went a fiſhing at riuers, paſſinge the fieldes, and huntinge in mountaines: in all whiche time he neuer entered citie, towne, or village, either ſlepte in anye houſe: and then ſent his

commaundement vnto the Senate to prepare a triumph, for that he woulde enter triumphinge into Rome: affirminge, that he better deſerued triumph, for killing beaſts that did eate corne, then other Emperours for killinge of men that liued in townes. The Senate neither might or durſt, but to receiue him with great triumph: &amp; the abhominable Commodus, moſt odiouſly in the chariot triumphant, placed a younge man named Anterus, and opēly, after the manner of man and wife, did imbrace eche other. In his progreſſe and paſtimes whiche hee vſed in thoſe mountaines, he loſt no parte of his euill cuſtomes: but rather added euill vpon euill: that is to ſay, the fierceneſſe which he recouered in ſlaying of wilde beaſtes, after his comming to Rome he imploied in murdering of many honourable perſonages. As touchinge the firſt, it is to wéete he baniſhed xxiiii. Conſuls, poſſeſt their goods, and made a rewarde therof vnto his ſtrumpets, &amp; other infamous perſons: whereof fiue by importunate ſuite, of his gratious fauour were reſtored to their houſes, and ſhortly after he cutt off their heads. There was in Rome a Senatour named Birrius, a man in ye days of Marcus Aurelius much eſtéemed, who deſerued to marry with a ſiſter of Commodus: who for that he warned and informed Commodus of his euill and foule life, he commaunded him and all his friends to be ſlaine: and alſo al the alies and ſeruants vnto his ſiſter.
               
               
                  From the time of Commodus father, there was remaining a certaine prefect named Ebutianus a man moſte truely auncient in yeares, and no yonglinge in vertues: Commodus being aduertiſed that Ebutianus had much lamented the death of the Conſul Birrius: vnto whom Commodus ſent a meſſenger to ſay vnto him: that he woulde vnderſtand of him, if he woulde wéepe for the death whiche he ſente him, as he had wéept with the life which he poſſeſſed: whiche being ſaide, by the commaundement of Commodus he cutte off his head.
               
               
                  Another Senatour named Apolauſtus, who alſo ſorowed

the death of Ebutianus, Commodus commaunded to be ſlaine.
               
               
                  The daye that Apolauſtus was executed certeine young gentlemen of Commodus his chamber, when they vnderſtoode of execution done vnto ſuche as mourned for Ebutianus: they deuiſed to make a ſhewe of great ioye for the death of Apolauſtus to eſcape the like daunger: whereof Commodus being aduertiſed, he commaunded their throtes to be cutte: ſaying yt 
                     for any acte done of the prince, they ought neither to laugh or weepe: but heare and ſee and holde their peace. Alſo he ſlewe Seruilius and Dulius with all their parentage which were deſcended of the linage of Silla: and he ſlewe Antius Lupus Petronius, and Mamertus, with all their bande, which were of the linage of Marius, affirminge, that he executed the Sillans, to reuenge the Marians, and executed the Marians to reuenge the Sillans.
                  
               
               
                  There was in Rome a younge gentleman a couſen to Commodus, both very faire and valiant: and one ſaying by chaunce vnto Commodus, that Mamertus Antonianus his couſen, did reſemble him in fauour, and imitate him in valiantneſſe: he commaunded them both preſently to be ſlaine, affirming, that he ſhoulde be an Emperour that did ſo reſemble and compare with him. Amongſt other anciente Romaines, there were ſixe olde Conſuls, whoſe names were, Alius Fuſcus, Celius Felices, Lucius Torquatus, Alatius Ropianus, Valerius Baſſianus and Patulius Magnus, who for their impotencie were not able to come vnto the Senate, he commaunded them all to be ſlaine: ſaying, that he was bounde to do in Rome, as the good gardener in his orchard: yt is to ſay, that the drie olde tree muſt be cutte or puld vp by the roote and caſt into the fire. In the gouernement of Aſia, the Senate had placed Sulpitius Craſſus, Iulius Proculus, and Claudius Lucanus, as Proconſuls to gouerne thoſe prouinces: whome withe their families, Commodus gaue order to be murthered with poyſon: becauſe in

his preſence they were praiſed, for their déedes done in Aſia: and alſo for communication, which they had of his euils committed in Rome. Marcus Aurelius viſitinge the kingdome of Achaia, had borne vnto him a Néece, and daughter of his ſiſter, named Annia Fauſtina, whome alſo Commodus commaunded to be ſlayne: but the quarell that he had to take away her life, was, for that ſhée had married without his licence. On a certaine day vpon the bridge of Tiber, were fourtéene noble Romaines talking and paſſinge the time: and Commodus at that inſtant paſſinge that way, ſaide vnto one that he ſhould demaunde as of him ſelfe, whereof they talked: vnto whome they anſweared, that they were recountinge the vertues of Marcus Aurelius, and that they had great ſorrowe of his death. Commodus hearing this anſwere, preſently and out of hande, commaunded all the xiiii. gentlemen to be hurled headlong ouer the bridge into the riuer: affirming, that they coulde not ſpeake well of his father, but that they muſt ſpeake euil of him which was his ſonne. He woulde many times play with the ſworde players: and betwixte ieſte and earneſt he killed a thouſand of them. He was ſo cruell of nature, and ſo doughtie in his déedes, that he had no ſcruple to kill, either feare to be ſlaine. Commodus perceiuinge that al the Romaines fledd, either to ſée, heare, ſpeake, or to be conuerſant with him, to no other ende but to auoyde occaſion to be ſlaine at his handes: he remembred to inuente a conſpiracie, which is to wéete, to ſay and publiſhe, that many had conſpired againſt him to his deſtruction: all which he commaunded to be ſtrangled and cutt in péeces, notwithſtandinge that any ſuche conſpiracie was neuer thought of or intended.
               
            
            
               CHAP. VII. Of a certaine conſpiracie attempted againſt Cōmodus, and of Perennius his moſt fauoured counſellour.
               
                  Amongſt other ſiſters, Commodus had one named Lucilla who in ye life of her father Marcus Aurelius, maried with a Conſul whoſe name was Lucius Verus, whōe he admitted with him ſelfe to be cōpanion in the Empire, by ſuch meane as Lucilla was intituled Empreſſe, &amp; her huſbande Emperour. But a yeare and three monethes, Lucius Verus liued as companion in the Empire with Marcus Aurelius, his father in lawe: in ſuche wiſe, that euen then, when he was very younge, he loſte his life, and Lucilla as younge became a widowe. Lucius Verus being dead, Marcus Aurelius married his daughter Lucilla vnto a noble Romaine named Pompeyanus, a man verie wiſe in letters, experte in armes, and aunciente in yeares.
After the death of Marcus Aurelius, Commodus ſucceding in the Empire, and not then married, did allwayes intreate his ſiſter Lucilla as Empreſſe, for as muche as ſhée had beene wife vnto an Emperour: and alſo being an auncient cuſtome, continued in the malice of man, that although the ſtate be finiſhed, and the goods cōſumed, notwithſtanding folly remaineth. Thus ſtoode the caſe: Commodus was after married vnto a Romaine ladie named Criſpina, vnto whome from thence foorthe honour was done, that was accuſtomed to be vſed vnto Lucilla, yt is to ſay, in ye Theatre or open place to ſitt in ye chiefeſt ſeate, to receiue giftes &amp; preſents of frée men, and by the ways to haue torchlight, and to be recited by name in prayers made in Temples. Mortall was the enuie that Lucilla receiued, to beholde the honour imperiall whiche ſhée had once in poſſeſſion, to be remoued, and paſſe vnto her ſiſter Criſpina: and from thence foorth, all her deuice, practiſe, and ſpeach, tended but to ridde her brother Commodus of his life, and Criſpina her ſiſter in lawe of her honour.
               
               
                  There was at courte with the prince a young gentleman of Rome, of noble bloude, &amp; of face beautifull, with whom it was bruted, Lucilla vſed vnhoneſt loue: his name was Quadratus, the ſonne of a very riche father, vnto

whome ſhée diſcouered the ſecrete of her intent, to kill her brother Commodus, becauſe he perſecuted her huſbande Pompeyanus, &amp; the Empreſſe Criſpina did deadly hate her.
               
               
                  
                     Quadratus deſirous to do Lucilla a pleaſure, conſented to performe that act, &amp; the order which he vſed therin was, that he ioyned in counſell with the ſonne of a Senatour named Quincianus, a yong man both doughtie &amp; valiaunt: who ſhoulde vpon the ſoudaine, with a ſwoord drawne, enter vpon Commodus in his chamber, with theſe words: This preſent the Senate ſendeth thee: and at the inſtante to cutt off his life. Quincianus accepted this enterpriſe, that is to ſay, to kill the Emperour Commodus: but failed at the time of the execution thereof: for notwithſtanding he had courage ſufficiēt to enter ye chamber with a ſword drawen, yet to performe the dede his hart was diſmaide: in ſuch wiſe, that the treaſon was vttered and the déede vnperformed.
               
               
                  
                     Quincianus was preſently taken, and diſcouered the conſpiracie that Quadratus and Lucilla had deuiſed for the deſtructiō of the Emperour Commodus. And for as much as Quincianus was ſonne vnto a Senatour, Commodus did beare ſo mortall hatred vnto the Senate, that from thence forth, whoſoeuer named him ſelfe a Senatour, he helde him for a traitour. Immediately after Commodus beganne to reigne, a warrlike capteine named Perennius, fell into his fauour: who in martiall affaires was verie experte, and of inclination and condition no leſſe peruerſe: for his pride was intollerable, &amp; his couetouſneſſe, inſatiable. The fauour, conuerſation, and credite, that Perennius had with Commodus was to the greate preiudice of al the Romaine people: becauſe if Commodus were cruell, Perennius was moſt cruell: if Commodus had yre, Perennius did perſuade to take vengeance: and beyonde al the reſt, did not diſuade from vice, but inuented new deuiſes to leade vnto wickedneſſe. Pompeyanus being a mā both honourable and aunciente, and huſband vnto Lucilla ſiſter vnto Commodus, the Emperour did beare him

ſome reuerence: and ioyntly therewith, Lucilla had the fame of great riches, in money &amp; iewells: wherof procéeded no ſmall diſpleaſure vnto Perennius, whoe hardely indured the eſtimation of others in the courte of the Emperour Commodus.
                  
               
               
                  Where vpon, the treaſon being diſcouered, he with greate impatience did incite the Emperour Commodus, on Pompeyanus and Lucilla to execute cruel iuſtice, which he inceſſantly perſuaded, not for iuſtice ſake, but to finiſh ye fauour which the Emperour did beare vnto Pompeyanus, and to gette vnto him ſelfe the treaſure of the ladie, Lucilla.
                  
               
               
                  
                     When princes be in yre, and furious, they haue much to conſider, of whome they demaunde counſell: becauſe, not a fewe but manie times it hapneth, that the priuate and fauoured courtiour giueth counſell vnto the prince, not ſo muche for the fauour he beareth to the execution of iuſtice, as for the reuengement of his owne cruell and damnified harte. The tyrant Perennius beholding Cōmodus inflamed with yre, did knowe to take the profite and benefite of time: that is to ſay, Pompeyanus, Lucilla, Quadratus, Quincianus and al their affinitie, brothers, friends &amp; ſeruants, he cauſed to be ſlaine, put to death, their goods to be confiſcate, in ſuch wiſe, that he was not onlie reuenged of all his enimies, but alſo applied vnto him ſelfe all their treaſure.
               
               
                  After the death of theſe perſons, all the affaires of the Empire were gouerned at the will, wiſedome, &amp; pleaſure of Perennius: who grewe to be a lord ſo abſolute of the Empire, that al ambaſſages that came to Commodus, he only heard them: and all letters miſſiue he reade and anſwered them, in ſuch manner, that Commodus bare ye name of Emperour, &amp; Perennius did enioy the empire. All offices and rewards being giuen by the handes of Perennius, procured ſeruice and diligence from all men, yt in as much, as he that might do moſt, ſaued moſt: but he was ſo harde of condition, and of golde and riches ſo cruel

and couetous, that of méere grace he gaue no office, but by the weight of pure money alwayes did ſell the ſame: and to him that woulde not buy, hee gaue preſentes more deare then the money which he demaunded. Perennius had enrolde the names of all the moneyed men in Italie, which if they did not preſent him ſome riche iuells, hee procured them to be placed in offices: wherein he did ſéeke quarells, to ſpoile them of their liues, and to robbe them of their goods.
               
            
            
               CHAP. VIII. Of a conſpiracie that Perennius wrought againſt the Emperour Commodus.
               IN verye ſhorte time Perennius became very riche, but his preſumption and riches being examined and laide together, without compariſon muche greater was the pride whiche he did ſhewe, then the treaſures which he poſſeſſed. Commodus had ſuche confidence in Perennius, that he not onely committed vnto him the gouernement of the whole common wealth, but alſo the order and honour of his houſe: in ſo muche that Perennius was of the one and the other ſo abſolute &amp; ſo diſſolute, that he was not contented to robbe Cōmodus of his riches, but alſo vſed vnlawfull companie with his owne eſpeciall courtiſans, by whōe he had both ſonnes and daughters. Perennius had ſonnes growne to mans eſtate, whiche were in the armies: and when any notable déede was done in the warres, he would reporte at the Emperours table, that it was perfourmed and atchiued by his ſonnes: in ſuch wiſe, that frō them ye were in peace he bereft their goods, and them that died in ye warrs he ſpoiled of their honour. In ye fifte yeare of Commodus
reigne, the Senate ſent an huge armie againſt the Britaines, whereof Perennius was admitted both Conſul and capteine: in whiche iourney he was not ſatiſfied, to be ſerued as one in fauour, and obeyed as Conſul: but would bee reuerenced as a prince, and adored as a God.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Perennius proſpering in his martiall affaires, and holding the whole common wealth in his owne handes, and poſſeſſing wealth aboue all reckoning, he then immagined to want nothing but the attainement of the Romaine empire: for the accompliſhement whereof, he throughly determined to kill his Lorde and maiſter Commodus, placing his ſonnes Pretors ouer all the armies, to be readie at hande in time vppon the newes of the death of the Emperour Commodus. Perennius alſo had drawne vnto his parcialitie certeine Senatoures, and other the welthieſt neighbours and citizens of Rome by giftes and rewardes in ſecret, but in eſpeciall by aggrauating the wicked life of Commodus. On the fourth day of May, the Romaines did celebrate the greate feaſt of Iupiter Capitoline, whereunto not onely the whole people of Rome, but alſo of all cities of Italie did concurre: and when the Emperour on that day was reſident in Rome, alwayes in his owne perſon went to authorize and ſée the feaſt. The Emperour Commodus beholding the playes and pageants prouided for that triumph, and Criſpina his wife being placed on the one hande, and Perennius the priuate and greately fauoured courtier, ſet on the other hande: they behelde a carte comming al couered with boughes, crying continually for roome and audience. And when they were come vnto the preſence of the Emperour Cō
                        modus and all perſons by his commaundement vſing ſilence, the people thinking they would haue vttered ſome pageant or matter of diſporte: ſoudeinly there appeared a man aloft vppon the carte, which had a long bearde, a ſhéepeheardes hooke in one hande, and a ſling in the other: and from the girdle vpwarde all naked, his other garments very poore, and after the manner of a Philoſopher, and directing his woordes vnto Commodus, ſaide:
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           The Oration to Commodus
                           O Commodus, it well ſeemeth that thou arte a

Prince, and that verie young, whiche arte in theſe playes and delightes ſo careleſſe and negligent, which thou oughteſt not to doe, becauſe Princes of thy age, eſtate, and condition, runne muche more in perill, in their exceſsiue pleaſures, then in their meane trauailes. Being (as thou arte) rigorous with thine owne, and furious and vnbridled with ſtraungers, thou oughteſt to conſider, and not to be vnmindfull, that thou haſt enimies: for the Prince that is feared of manie, hath iuſt cauſe alſo to feare manie. The greateſt riches, and the beſt treaſure in this world, is trueth, whereof Princes be moſte poore of all people: for that their eares being fild and led away with lyes, may take no taſte in matters of trueth. Thou Commodus and other Princes, do not euil gouerne your common wealthes of any prepenced malice to deſtroye the ſame: but becauſe ye giue not, either delight your ſelues to heare the poore that be grieued and oppreſſed, when they complaine, neither the good, godly, and vertuous, when they giue aduiſement, of the greate and horrible vices of briberie, extortion, and violent robberies, committed by officers, by the priuate and fauoured, by the mightie and men of power. Great is the fault of Princes, for the vices which they committ, but much greater is their offence in diſſembling the offences of their fauoured ſeruaunts, becauſe ye offend not, but onely the Gods, but they both offende the Gods, vexe and trouble men, &amp; are traitours to your own perſons. Although Commodus, thou be licentious, diſſolute, wilfull, &amp; alſo not very honeſt: it is impoſsible, but if the hurtes and miſchiefes, ſcandals, and robberies, committed by thy officers &amp; fauoured ſeruants, were notified &amp;

giuen thee to vnderſtand, thou wouldeſt commaund them to be amēded, &amp; alſo to be remedied: for in the ende there is no Prince ſo euill, that deſireth not his common wealth to flouriſh. At theſe dayes, trueth in Princes houſes is ſo odious, that who ſo aduentureth but to make reporte therof, of death he muſt haue determination: and if any ſuch do eſcape with life, it proceedeth of ſome conceite to be ſpoken of madneſſe. That, which at this preſent I will ſay &amp; diſcouer, I proteſt vnto the immortal Gods, it proceedeth not of madneſſe, for that my natural iudgement is confirmed with reaſon: either do I ſay it of malice, to be reuenged of any perſon: but onely (Oh Commodus) to deliuer thy life of great peril, and to franchiſe Rome from ſeruitude of a tyrant: for that which I preſume to ſaye, and aduenture to diſcouer, I am aſſured before my tale be ended, my life ſhalbe taken away. But (O Commodus) I giue thee to vnderſtande, that if thou wilt not giue faith vnto my woordes, the time will come, when thou ſhalt vnderſtand the trueth, of all that I haue ſaide, when thy miſchiefe may haue no remedie. Thou (Commodus) art there ſet &amp; placed, with the Empreſſe Criſpina on thy right hand, &amp; on thy left hand thy priuate &amp; fauoured Perennius, but hadſt thou certeine intelligēce, what he hath ordeined againſt thee, with thine owne hands yu wouldeſt burie him quick. Perennius hath not been ſatiſfied, to put to death all good men, to be reuenged of his enimies, to haue deſtroyed all thy ſeruants, to haue robbed all thy treaſures: but that nowe he practiſeth to take away thine owne life, to aduaunce and exalt him ſelfe to the whole power of this citie and common wealth.
                           
                              O Commodus, if thou knowe not, I giue thee to vnderſtand, yt the ſonnes of Perennius, by fraud haue incēſed thy armies of Illyria agaīſt the. Perēnius him ſelfe ceaſeth not to corrupt the Senate, and ſecretly ſeketh to winne the mindes of men, giuing giftes, and large rewardes vnto the people: and all to the ende that vpon the firſt newes of thy death, without contradictiō, he may poſſeſſe ye whole eſtate of ye Romane Empire. And think not, that Perennius doth now be gin to attēpt this treaſon, for yt of great certeintie I do aſſure thee, that many dayes paſt he hath put the ſame in practiſe, &amp; is vpon the point, at this inſtant, to haue it to be executed: in ſo much that if on this day I had not aduentured to giue thee warning, be thou aſſured, that on this preſent day before this feaſt had bene finiſhed, thy life had here bene ended.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  Vntil that poore man had ſaide, that on that day Commodus death was prepared, not onely the people gaue eare, but alſo Perennius: whoe preſently roſe out of his chayre with greate furie, commaunding the ſwoord players to kill that preſumptuous and raſhe dizarde, who was preſently ſlaine, drawne, cut in péeces and burnt.
               
               
                  
                     Perennius of all men ſo deadly hated, by this poore mannes tale, ſunke into ſuſpicion of the people, and alſo Commodus conceiued againſt him ſome ſcruple: but that Philoſopher béeing there ſlaine, and Perennius in ſo greate power, although they had all ſuſpicion of his treaſon, yet no man there durſt ſpeake a worde. The matter remaining certeine dayes more ſuſpicious then cleare: there came gentlemen from Illyria, and brought certein péeces of golde, wherein bothe the name &amp; alſo the Image of Perennius was ingrauen: whiche money Perennius commaunded his ſonnes in greate ſecrecie to be made.
               
               
                  
                  The coyners thereof being aduertiſed what the Philoſopher had ſaide, and being in greate doubt in proceſſe of time to be diſcouered, came vnto Commodus and manifeſted the whole matter, which were not onely pardoned, but alſo largely rewarded. The treaſon being detected, which the traitour and tyrant Perennius had deuiſed, it ſéemed good vnto the friendes of Commodus, and the enimies of Perennius, to the ende to deliuer him from all ſuſpicion, firſt and immediately to cut off his head: for that Perennius being guilefull, and in great power, might haue preuented his owne execution with the ſlaughter of others.
               
               
                  A great parte of the night being paſt, and Perennius repoſing in his owne houſe, Commodus commaunded him to be called in great haſte, aduertiſing him at the inſtant of letters out of Aſia: who entring the Emperours chamber, founde not Commodus, but yet wanted not that preſently cut off his head. At the inſtant that Perennius was put to death, a poſt with greate ſpéede was ſent into Illyria, by whome Commodus did write vnto the ſonnes of Perennius, that all thinges ſet aparte, they ſhould repaire to Rome to viſite their father being ſicke in his bedde: to the ende that if the deſtinies ſhoulde permit his death, to ſuccéede in his place. The ſonnes of Perennius did well thinke that all had béene truthe which was written vnto them, and nothing doubting the detection of their treaſon, preſently departed towards Come: but at their entrie of the firſt citie of Italie, they were made ſhorter by bothe their heades. This in concluſion was the ende of ye tyrant Perennius, which loſt his ſonnes, his goods, his honour, and his life: not rather for any miſchiefe, then for his preſumption and pride. Of this example, let all Princes take warning, howe they magnifie their ſeruauntes with too greate wealth and power: and this is ſaide, becauſe potencie ingendreth enuie: and ouermuch riches doth breede and bring forth pride.
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. IX. ¶Of the tyrant Maternus, and of his treaſon againſt Commodus.
               EXcéeding ioy did the Romaines receiue of the death of Perennius, and his ſonnes, becauſe his auarice and pride was more ſharpe and intollerable, then the folly of Commodus. The offices of Perennius were diuided amongeſt many: becauſe it ſéemed, that ſo greate authoritie and power, to be placed and committed in one perſon, were to put his life in perill, and his Empire to commiſſion. Incredible and innumerable were the richeſſe, iewels, and money, that were confiſcate by the death of Perennius and his ſonnes: but they were ſo wilfully and wickedly diuided and ſpent, that whatſoeuer Perennius gathered by extortion and briberie, Commodus ſpent &amp; imployed in vices. There was in thoſe dayes in Italie a certeine man named Maternus, who from his childhood was bred in the armies of Illyria: of nature bolde and valiant, ſubtile, painefull, ſharpe or quicke, proude, ſeditious, and ſtammering, in ſuch wiſe, that as he was filthie of his toung, ſo was he ſoudeine of his handes. In all debates, ſeditions, and mutinies which happened in the campes, or cities, this Maternus was euer founde one, either the chiefe authour thereof, or elſe to be noted aboue
the reſt, becauſe they ſaye, this was his common ſpeache, that on that daye, wherein he ſhed no bloude, wine had no good reliſhe.
The captaines of the armies did partly beare with him for his valiantneſſe, but on the other ſide, they might not endure his continuall quarelinges, and in the ende his lewdneſſe being growen intollerable, they did not onely diſpatche him from the warres, but alſo did baniſhe him the confines of Italie.
               
               This Maternus being a ringleader of all wicked and deſperate perſons that were in the armies, many did accompanie

and alſo followe him in that exile: not to remaine as bounde to leade a better life, but to haue libertie to committ muche euil. With thoſe companions that Maternus had recouered from the armies, and with others that dayly ioyned with him, he obteined vnder his Standarde twentie thouſande footemen, and two thouſand horſſemen within the ſpace of foure monethes: with which people Maternus committed ſo many robberies, burnings, and ſlaughters in the cities and territories of Italie, as if an Hanibal had béene raiſed from the dead to conquere Rome.
               
               
                  Italie being robbed and ſacked, Maternus departed into Lombardie, and from thence into Fraunce, and after into Spaine: in which kingdomes, he continued in that courteſie whiche he vſed in Italie: and that whiche was moſte to be marueiled, was, that his armie daily increaſed, and no man attempted to reſiſt him, in ſuche wiſe, wiſe, that with them which were preſent, he did yeld occaſion to be buſied, and with them that were abſent, he miniſtred matter of communication. This tyrant Maternus and his people, helde no other trade but to rob temples, to ſacke townes, to ſcowre the fieldes, to ſpoyle corne, to burne houſes, to force women, to defile virgins: and that whiche was woorſte, that not contented for them ſelues to liue at libertie, they brake priſons, and ſet at large all malefactours.
               
                  It is amongeſt euils the ſupreme euil, and in tyrantes the greateſt tyrannie, that they of them ſelues will not liue according to reaſon and iuſtice, but that alſo they wil not conſent that malefactours be committed to iuſtice.
                  
                     Maternus and his armie remaining in Spaine, Cō
                        modus wrote vnto all the Pretors of thoſe countries, to raiſe an armie of great power, to deſtroy the tyrant Maternus, and to make greate promiſes by publique proclamations, that vnto him whiche ſhould cutt off the heade, or take the bodie or perſon of Maternus, ſhoulde haue in rewarde all his goodes, and his picture aduaunced and

ſet vp in Rome.
                  
               
               
                  The firſt proclamations were publiſhed in Saragoſa, at which time Maternus was reſident in Taragon, who being aduertiſed that they of Spaine prepared an armie againſt him, and that amongeſt the captaines great wagers were laide, who ſhoulde firſt ridde him of his life: he determined to returne into Italie with determination to kill Commodus in Rome. Where vpon Maternus moſte ſecreatly conferred, with his chief and ſpecial friends &amp; arranteſt théeues and moſt doughtie perſonages, to forſake the armye: ſeuerally diuidinge them ſelues, by ſundrye wayes vpon one certaine and appointed day without faile to make their méeting in Rome. Preſently after Maternus was gonne out of ſight, al ye remnant of his army was diſmaide and fel in péeces, wherof there were infinite taken, ſtrangled, drowned, drawne &amp; hāged: in ſuch wiſe, that in ſo great a number of theues, none had better aduenture, then to be ſlaine or put to death, except he had friendly fauour of fortune to be made a bondman. Maternus &amp; his cōpanions, the day, houre, &amp; place, on which they had agréed in Spaine, ioyntly did encounter at Rome: whiche for a time wente diſperſed &amp; diſguiſed by day, but ioyned by night to committ their theftes: being furniſhed for their prouiſion, but onely with ſuche prouiſion as they might pick by day, and ſteale by night, wherein they vſed ſo greate ſhiftes, guile, and ſkill, that although they accompanied but by couples, yet, if the warde or watche by daye or night did attempt to arreſt or offende any one, at an inſtant they were all ready for his defence: in ſuch wiſe, that although they wer of great diſorder in their life: yet they vſed great conformitie in agréement for the manner and faſhion of their robberies
               
               
                  One of the thinges wherein the malice of man moſte readily doeth ſhewe it ſelfe is, that to doe euill, wee are ſoone agreed: but to perfourme a good woorke, wee conſent with greate difficultie.
               
               
                  
                     Commodus was well perſuaded, that the tyraunt

                     Maternus was nowe deade, imagining in his owne conceit, that at the forſaking of his campe, and renouncing of his armie, of extreme deſperation and horrour of him ſelfe, he had deſperately drowned or committed him ſelfe to the halter. But Maternus in recompence of the loſſe of his potencie, and negligence of his honour, bent all his ſtudie to deliuer Commodus from his life. The Romaines helde a cuſtome vppon the tenth day of Marche, to celebrate the feaſt of the Goddeſſe Berecyntha: on that day the Emperour and the Senate went vnto her temple, to offer ſacrifices, which done and perfourmed, generally all perſons for the moſt part diſguiſed them ſelues, maſking and feaſting throughout the whole citie: in ſuche manner, their faces being couered, the one was vnknowne vnto the other. Maternus and other his fellowe théeues and friendes, had agréed to weare ſecrete armour, with face diſguiſed, that when the Emperour Commodus ſhould moſt chiefly be addicted to viewe and beholde the playes, and his guarde moſt careleſſe of his perſon: by a coūterfet braule amongſt them ſelues, to finde ready meane to cut off his life. But notwithſtanding Maternus had loſt his welth, power, and honour, he ceaſed not to continue proude, hautie, and diſdainefull: ſeeking to be ſerued and reuerenced, not as a friende and poore companion, but after the manner of a Prince, and as one that were very rich. Wherevpon certaine of his companions, being not onely wéeryed, but tyred, to walke lurkingly in corners, and not able to indure to be handled with ſo great ſeruitude: and further, fearing ſome day to be diſcouered, they repayred vnto Commodus, and with great ſecrecie manifeſting the whole matter, which is to wit, that Maternus the tyrant was a liue, and fully determined in thoſe playes and feaſtes to kill him. Incredible was the feare wherewith Commodus was touched, when he hearde that Maternus the tyrant was aliue: and no leſſe was his ioy, to conſider the conſpiracie to be detected: and notwithſtanding Commodus had intelligence thereof certaine dayes before the

feaſt, hée ſuſpended the execution thereof vntill the day of the Goddeſſe Berecyntha: to the end that nothing ſhould be reuealed vnto Maternus, of that which was diſcouered vnto Commodus. The maner that Maternus deuiſed to murder Commodus, the ſame did Commodus vſe to take and kill Maternus, that is to ſay: the great day of the feaſt being come, as Maternus and his band came maſked and armed: ſo Commodus brought forth his men armed and diſguiſed: and with a ſet quarell the traitour and tyraunt Maternus was ſlaine, and his men cutt all to péeces. The greateſt feaſt of that feaſt was celebrate, in ſtrāgling, hewing, mangling, drawing &amp; burning of the bodies of theſe miſerable théeues: becauſe it is an euident lawe for tyrants, that the hurtes, robberies, ſlaughters, violences, and burninges, which they haue committed in many dayes, they come to make repayment thereof in one houre.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. X. ¶ Of the inexpected death of Cleander, a fauoured and moſt priuate ſeruant vnto Commodus.
               AFter the death of the tyrant Maternus, the Emperour Commodus paſſed his life in great doubt and feare, imagining with himſelfe, that ſome day they would diſpatch him, either eating or ſléeping: for he did both knowe, and alſo would ſay, that they were fewe which prayed for his life, but very many that ſighed for his death. Vntill Commodus died hée euer walked warely: for hée doubled his guard, to guard him by day, and ſtrongly ſhutt in his houſe by nighte: in that which hée did eate, in his lodging where he ſlept, on the palfrey wheron he roade, on the garments which hée did weare, hée ſet great watche: in ſuch wiſe, that hée paid it but only with his life that durſt touch his garment.
               Very ſéeldome he went to the Senate, and much leſſe

did ride openly in the citie: hée had not talke with ſtrangers but by writing: with his ſubiects he had no conference, but by a perſon intermitted: and that which was more maruell, hée had many times ſuch conceite, not onely to refuſe to write, aunſweare, heare cauſes, or diſpatch affayres: but alſo in foure or fiue dayes would not ſpeake onely one word.
In the xi. yeare of his Empyre, Maternus the tyraunt was ſlaine: on the next yeare there followed a great peſtilence, and a generall hunger, in which hunger and peſtilence, the third part of Italie was conſumed. Immediatly after the peſtilence had entred Rome, Commodus departed vnto ye citie of Laurento, where were planted many Laurel trées, for which cauſe the citie was named Laurento: where alſo the Emperour more remayned, then in any other place: the Phyſicians giuing him to vnderſtand, that to be vnder the ſhadowe therof, was very proper and conuenient for defence of the peſtilence. Notwithſtanding the ſcarſitie of bread and wine that was that yeare, further, a certaine occaſion of great hūger happened in Rome, which was as followeth. When the good Marcus Aurelius triumphed ouer the Argonautes, he brought amongeſt other captiues a younge man named Cleander: who was openly ſolde in the market place in Rome, and by chaunce bought by a clarke of the kitchin, to ſwéepe &amp; make cleane the larder at courte. This ſlaue Cleander became ſo handſome in ſwéeping, ſeruing, and pleaſing his maiſter, that not many yeares after, he did not onely make him frée, and marrie him with his daughter, but alſo did aduance him to the office of Clarke of the kitchin: in ſuch maner, that from the eſtate of a bondman, hée indued him with the condition of a ſonne. Nowe when Clēander ſawe himſelfe frée, married, and in office in the Court, he trauelled to obteine the good will of the Emperour Marcus Aurelius, which he obteyned by carefulneſſe in ſeruice, and diligence in his office: and vſed therin ſo great diligence and promptneſſe, that he was neuer noted, either ſlacke in prouiſion, or falſe in reckoning.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Marcus Aurelius being deade, Commodus forgate not to remoue Cleander from the affayres of the kitchin, and made him capitaine of his guard, and Lord great Chamberlaine of his chamber. Vnto none of as many as did ſerue &amp; accompany Commodus in his youth that hée was gratefull, but vnto Cleander: vnto whom it had bin much better, neuer to haue riſen to ſo great honour: for thereof onely procéeded the loſſe of his life. Althoughe the fauour of Cleander did riſe in ieſt or of ſmall cauſes, he framed in fewe dayes to performe the ſame in earneſt, which was as followeth: that as Commodus grew into diſgrace, &amp; was abhorred and had no care of the gouernement of the Empire, Cleander did preſſe and in ſuch maner did thronge to entermedle with affayres, that for the more part all matter were diſpatched at his will and pleaſure: in ſuch wiſe, that Commodus gaue or firmed nothinge, if Cleander did not ſigne or allowe the ſame. Commodus had neuer any priuate or fauoured ſeruaunt, that in all points could ſo winne his will as Cleander: who affirmed to wiſhe nothing, that Commodus wiſhed not, either to allowe any thing that hée ſaid not: but aduouched alſo that he did not thinke or dreame, but that which Commodus did dreame and thinke: and with theſe and ſuche like lyes and flatteries, hee wan the hart of Commodus, and obteyned ſeruice of the whole Empire. After Cleander beheld himſelfe the onely priuate and fauoured ſeruaunt of Commodus, hée eaſily made himſelfe rich: obteyning the cuſtodie, not onely of the whole common treaſure, but alſo the kéeping of all the monie and iewels of the Emperour Cō
                        modus: and further in giuing offices, and receiuing preſentes, his ſinceritie excéeded not. But Cleander finding himſelfe in ſo great magnificence, began not greatly to regarde ſo great fauour, or much leſſe the obteyning of ſo great wealth: conceyuing in the end, that Commodus did vſe him as a vaſſall, and that hée muſt accompt him as his Lord: to cut off which opprobrie, and to giue contentation vnto his heart, he determined to kill Commodus, and for

himſelfe to vſurpe the Empire. Cleander did build at the port Salaria, moſt coſtly and delectable bathes, and comaunded proclamation to be made in Rome, to notifie vnto all men, that would bathe therein, to be diſcharged of all coſt, and fréely to vſe the ſame: and alſo added thereunto great paſtimes, and preparations vnto all kinde of vices: in ſuch wiſe, that there they cleanſed their bodies, &amp; defiled their ſoules. Many times Cleander did inuite the Senate, and ſent them particular preſents home to their houſes: The Pretors, Cenſors, Queſtors, Tribunes, Prefectes, and other Romane officers, he cauſed their dueties to be paied: and all the men of warre he did not onely pay them, but alſo did trauel to hold them contented: in ſuch maner, that ſome with vitious delights and pleaſures, and ſome by rewards, giftes, and monie, in a maner he recouered all men for his friendes. In the yeare of great hunger and peſtilence in Italie, Cleander bought all the wheat in the countries adioyning vnto Rome: wherein his intent was, not to gaine or make a profite thereof, but to bring Rome into a neceſſitie, to ye end that all men ſhould come to his houſe for wheate: and therein to haue vſed ſo great liberalitie, in ſelling good cheape, and giuing plentifully, in a yeare ſo deare, that after the death of the Emperour Commodus, they ſhould not miſlike to giue him the Empire. And as hunger increaſed cruelly, a great part of the yeare beeing as yet to come, and the people not knowing Cleanders intent, who did neither giue or ſell any wheate: ſoudainly al Rome did riſe, exclaming death and treaſon againſt Cleander, as an vſurper of the goodes of the common wealth. Cleander being a man valiaunt, of great power, and Captaine of the guard, comaunded all the men of his captaineſhip, to be armed: who did place themſelues in the compaſſe of his houſe, for the garde of his perſon, and to reſiſte that ciuil furie: although it be moſt true, that hée rather defended the ſacking of his houſe, then of feare to defende his life. The towneſmen on the one ſide, and Cleander on the other part, trauerſed amongeſt themſelues ſo long and

perillous a contention: that it ſéemed no other matter, but that Silla and Marius were once more fallen into fight, for the ſeignorie of Rome. And as Cleanders partie was defended with men both armed and determined, in the firſt onſet they executed ſo great ſlaughter amongeſt the people, that ſcarſly a ſtreate was to be founde in Rome, that was not bathed with bloud: either any place great or litle, that was not filled with dead bodies. The towneſmen perceyuing the ſlaughter and hauocke which the men of warre ſo cruelly did performe amongeſt them, retired euery man into his houſe: and fortifying their doores, they fought from their windowes and houſe toppes, and from thence threw and whirld out ſtones, tiles, ſpitts, potts, and caldrons: and in that ſo common danger, no leſſe did womē fight then men: &amp; Cleanders partie ſo hardly handled, that ſcarcely remained a hundred yt were not ſlaine or woūded. Whilſt theſe déeds were doing at Rome, Commodus was recreating himſelfe in an houſe which he had in an orchard, and Cleander being of great power, of ſome feared, and of others beloued, no man durſt make report therof vnto Cō
                        modus, becauſe ſo ſtrong was the frendſhip betwixt them, that they feared the diſpleaſure of the one, and the vnkindnes of them both. There was in the Courte a ſiſter vnto Commodus named Fadilla: whoſe eyes being charged wt teares, and tearing her haire from her head, as one in gret diſtreſſe, ſaid vnto her brother Commodus. Moſt ſerene prince, and right deare brother, if thou wert aduertiſed of the condition and eſtate of Rome, thou wouldeſt not be ſo careleſſe ſolacing in this garden: becauſe I giue thee to vnderſtand, that the yeomē of thy guard in the fauour of Cleander, and al the other people of the common wealth, haue trauerſed amongeſt themſelues ſo cruell a fight, that if preſētly at this inſtant thou prouide not ſome remedie, this day wil be the end of the Romane people. The exceding honour, the great riches, &amp; to to much fauour which thou haſt imployed vppon Cleander, hath raiſed him into exceeding great pride, wherof although he be in the fault,

yet the occaſion hath beene giuen by thee: for as thou makeſt Lordes of bondmen, it is moſt certaine that they will make ſlaues of Lords &amp; noblemen. The people be ſo furious againſt Cleander, &amp; Cleander and his men ſo fleſht againſt the people, that thou haſte to chuſe one of two thinges: which is to witt, to yeld Cleander vnto the common people, or els to abide what fortune of them and vs ſhalbe proued: for as the caſe ſtandeth now impoiſoned, it is impoſſible, that ioyntly thy life and his perſon this day may be preſerued. Theſe words being ſpoken by the infant Fadilla, all men preſent recouered new boldnes, perſuading Commodus to remoue Cleander from amongeſt them, and ſo to appeaſe the whole people of Rome: and to hold the eaſe of the common wealth more deare, then the friendſhip or life of Cleander. Commodus hearing theſe matters, &amp; diſmaid with feare, forthwith cōmaunded Cleander to come vnto his preſence: and at the inſtante of his appearance, commaunded his head to be cut off, which being ſet vpon a lance, and carried about Rome, immediatly the whole multitude was pacified. Cleander being put to death, his children, ſeruauntes, &amp; friends, were executed, whoſe bodies after they were drawen by boyes throughout Rome, were throwen into ſinkes and places of vile ordure. This was the concluſion and end of Cleander, and the end of his children, his houſe, goodes, and honour: who though for many things, ought to be reprehended, yet onely for one thing he deſerueth praiſe, namely, that he had rather die a gentleman, then liue a ſlaue.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. XI. ¶The report of a fire which deſcended from heauen, and burnt in Rome the temple of peace.
               ONe of the moſt notable exāples, wherin fortune hath diſcouered the inconſtancie of her whéele, was in the

diſcourſe that ſhe had &amp; vſed wyth Cleander and his houſe: whoe in ſhort ſpace, of a ſlaue made a fréeman, of a fréeman a Steward, of a Steward a Pretour, of a Pretour a Chamberlaine, &amp; of a Chamberlaine, in effect a Monarche of the world: and afterwards in one day, and in one houre, was vtterly deſtroyed: whereby wée haue to learne, that While wee liue in this life, with ſuretie wee poſſeſſe nothing. Hee ought not to be diſmaide, that from an high eſtate, is deſcended vnto a poore degree: neither ought he to glorie or grow proud, that from a baſe eſtate, is aduanced to honour: for ther is none in ſo wretched condition, that hopeth not to growe better: either is there any ſo ſet a loft, that needeth not to doubt to catch a fall.
               
               The preſent day that Cleander was put to death, Commodus repaired vnto his imperial Palace, &amp; neuer more returned vnto his garden, neither to dwell, either as much as to ſolace: and if in times paſt hee had bin cruell, from thence forth hée was much more cruell, and alſo ſuſpicious: for hée conceyued that popular ſedition procéeded not, to take vengeaunce of Cleander, but for deuice to diſpatch him of his life. His friends, his kinſefolks, his counſellers, his ſeruaunts, his natural ſubiects, and alſo ſtrangers, hée held them all his vtter enimies: becauſe he doubted that all maner of men, that came to ſpeake with him, came to deceiue him: and ſuch as repaired to viſite him,
that by treaſon they would kill him. In the xij. yeare of his Empire on the xvij. day of March, at noone the heauen was ſéene full of ſtarres, as if it had béene midnight: and that which was moſt meruell, and neuer read in bookes, or ſéen with eyes, that on the euening when the Sunne naturally was accuſtomed to be ſéene to ſett in the Weſte, they beheld riſing in the Eaſt. In ye moneth of Iuly next following, a Comet appeared in heauen, as large as a great beame, and ſo flamed with fire, directing his ſparkles vnto the citie of Rome. On the xx. day of the moneth of Auguſt, ſoudenly the heauens being cleare, neither raynie or cloudie, in Rome there ſtrake an horrible clap of

thunder: and after the thunder, there came a globe of fire, which burned the temple, named the temple of peace.
                  
This tēple in authoritie was moſt auncient, in buildinges moſt ſtately, in riches moſt wealthie, with prieſtes moſt publiſhed, and in deuotion moſt eſtéemed: becauſe in all other Churches, the Romanes might pray vnto their Gods ſitting or ſtanding: but there were forced to pray on their knées. All men which had monie, treaſure, iewels, or rich ſtuffe, layd it all vp in the temple of peace: not onely thinking them moſt ſafe, by ye ſtronge building of the Church, but alſo of deuotion to commende and offer their goodes vnto the God of peace, to obteine permiſſion to enioy quietnes.
The loſſe which the Romanes receiued, by thoſe flames of fire, did excéede all reckoning: for yt in a maner all rich men had there their riches burnt &amp; conſumed: in ſuch wiſe, that no heart might endure, either yet diſſemble, to heare the cries of men, and the exclamation of women: euery man recounting his loſſe vnto his neighbour, &amp; ioyntly bewayling the burning of the temple. Now when the temple of peace was burnt, viſibly they did ſée it paſſe, vnto the temple of the veſtall virgins: which wholy it conſumed, leauing no ſigne of any building thereof. And yet notwithſtanding, better order was taken for the remedie thereof, then in the other temple: for preſently vppon the kindling of the fire, they tooke out the veſtall virgins, whiche there were incloſed, and the reliques which the Romanes had there repoſed And for as much as wée haue ſaid of reliques, it is to vnderſtand, that the Romanes had in that temple the Palladium: that is to ſay, the image of the goddeſſe Pallas, which fell from heauen vpon the walls of Troy, and from thence was brought to Rome: which was holden in as great veneration, as the arke of the Lord amonges the Iſraelites. The Romanes held that Image of the Goddeſſe Pallas, ſo ſhut vp, incloſed and hidden: that long time after ſhée was brought from Troy, of mortall man being neuer ſéene: either of Conſul, Emperour, or prieſt: for they had a prophecie, that in the yeare, in which

that Image ſhould be ſéene, there ſhould be great chaunge in the proſperitie of Rome.
                  
               
               The Romanes remoued their veſtall virgins, and the Image of their Goddeſſe Pallas, vnto the houſe of Commodus: and ſo great was the lamentation amongeſt the Romanes, to behold their veſtall virgins ſet at large, and their Palladium diſcouered, that without compariſon they did much more bewaile the burning of their temple of reliques, then the other temple that conteyned all their riches.
After this globe of fire had burned the temple of Peace, and the temple of Reliques, it burned alſo many other ſumptuous buildinges: not burning alongeſt after the manner of other fire, but amongeſt many houſes burnt one, and farre off from thence would burne another: wherof the Romanes did gather, that it was not the fire in vſe amongeſt men, ſeruing onely to burne: but a fire ſent from the Godds, to conſume and chaſtice.
Theſe terrible fireinges, and prodigious ſpectacles, of the Romanes being cō
                  ſidered, if vntil that time they did wiſhe the Emperour euill, from thenceforth they could neither endure to behold him, either abide with patience to heare his name: for they held it for certeintie, that all thoſe euill ſignes wherwith the Godds did threaten the Common wealth, were
all ſent for his foule and filthie life. This globe of fire continued by the ſpace of a xi. dayes: in all which time it ceaſed not to burne temples and houſes. On the xij. day Commodus rode out of the citie, and at the inſtante that he went out at the gates, ſoudainely the fire ceaſed: which confirmed the Romanes in their opinion, namely that during the life of Commodus, the Romane people of the gods ſhould alwayes be ſcourged.
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. XII. ¶ Of many cruelties, and not a fewe phantaſtical practiſes of Commodus.
               AS it hath béene ſaid, Commodus continued certaine dayes very ſad and penſiue, when he conſidered how traytors ſought occaſion to take away his life, and the terrible flames and burninges of Rome: but in ſhort time after, hee both forgat the chaſtiſement of the Gods, and conſpiracies of men: and this manifeſtly appeared, for that he ſo ſtoutly returned to all his vices, as if he had neuer beene vitious. Cleander being dead, hée made Niger Prefect, and after ſixe houres hee did reuoke his power, and commaunded him to be baniſhed: and prouided alſo Galba Rufus for his Chamberlaine, whom after foure houres he diſcharged of his office, and ſent him in exile: and when Niger &amp; Rufus complained of their griefes, Commodus aunſweared, hée did not baniſhe them for that which they had done, but for that which they might doe. He created Prefect Marcus Dulius, a man (moſt certaine) right generous and auncient: whome after thrée dayes hée remoued from his office, and comaunded him vntill his death, in his houſe to be priſoner, the occaſion whereof was, for that (as hée affirmed) Marcus was very old and ſpente, and therefore it were no reaſon he ſhould be troubled of any perſon: and alſo, that if any man ſhould requeſt any thing, hée mighte aunſweare him, that hée was a priſoner, and might not go out of his doores to doe him pleaſure. He gaue the Senate to vnderſtand, that hée would go into Africa, and had neceſſitie, for his nauie by ſea, &amp; his army by land, of a great ſumme of monie: although the Senate did ſuſpect it but a colluſion, they durſt not but open the treaſurie, and diuide with him the treaſure: for otherwiſe, he would both make hauoche of their liues and treaſure.
               In April the Senate gaue foorth their monie, and when

                  Commodus was in poſſeſſion thereof, he bruted his departing vnto Campania, to take men of warre: where hée remayned ail that Summer, and alſo parte of the next winter, eating, drinking, fiſhing, hunting, playing, wraſtling, running, leaping, dauncing, ſwimming, and ſuch other vanities. All the Senate was much aſhamed, and all the Romanes not a litle touched, after they vnderſtood the monie which was giuen out for the warres of Africa, to be ſo vitiouſly conſumed by Commodus in Campania. After his returne to Rome, Commodus was aduertiſed, that Motilenus Prefect for that yeare, had murmured more at him, then any other perſon: and for very griefe and deſpight did wéepe, to ſée their monie prouided for the warres, ſpent in ſo wicked vſes: Commodus confected certaine figgs, and inuited Motilenus to dinner, who being fed with figs died
ye third day following. One day he clad himſelf as a prieſt, right pontifically, and placed himſelfe aloft on a choche of 4. furious horſes: the Romanes ſuppoſing he would offer ſacrifices at the temple, he mounted certeine rockie cliftes &amp; mountaines: and there againſt all reaſon ran his charriot, where his horſes happened to be all to torne, &amp; his chariot rent all to péeces, and hée brake his head, and wrenched his foote: finally he made a narrow miſſe, in repayment of his follie, that day to haue loſt his life.
On a day he went to ye Senate, and ſaid that hee would not haue Rome named Rome, but Cōmodiana: and the Senate aunſwered, they were both pleaſed to call Rome Cōmodiana, and the Senate Cōmodiano. That which the Senators ſuppoſed to be demaunded in ieſt, alſo conſenting in ieſt, Commodus did accept in earneſt: &amp; from thenceforth, the letters which were written, the prouiſions which were made, &amp; the ſeals therto ioyned, in al ſuch inſtruments Rome was intituled Cōmodiana, &amp; the Senate Cōmodiano: and if by negligēce any man happened to be obliuious therof, &amp; to vſe ye name of Rome, preſently he was baniſhed from thence, to ſéeke Rome: for that was not, but Cōmodiana.
                  The prieſts of ye Goddeſſe Iſis were commanded to come into his preſence,

and ſaid vnto them, that ſhée had reuealed vnto him, that their heads ſhould be ſhauen, and that hée was commaunded as high prieſt to performe the ſame: and with a blunte knife hée cutt their nailes, and blunting his knife vppon ſtones, would drie ſhaue their heades: in ſuch wyſe, that as their haire was drie, and his knife blunt, it might more truely be ſaid, that hée did rather fley them, then trimme or dreſſe them. Such as garded the temple of the Goddeſſe Bellona, hée cauſed their right armes to be thruſt out of ioynte: alledging, that ſince they painted the Goddeſſe with a broken arme, her prieſtes ought not to haue their armes whole and ſound. The Romanes painted their Goddeſſe Iſis with naked breſtes: and Commodus on a day viſiting that temple, and beholding the image of Iſis, painted with breſtes diſcouered: hée cauſed the breſtes of the prieſts to be ſcrat with combs of yron in his preſence, affirming that it were vniuſte for their Goddeſſe to haue naked breſtes, and they to hold their entrailes hidden.
               
               
                  
                     Commodus commaunded all men to call him Hercules, which, to the end hée would reſemble, hée made a coate of Lions ſkinnes, and tooke in hand an huge clubb, wherwith hée wente day and night killing men, breaking doores, and ouerthrowing pillers, with ſuch other vanities: in ſo much that a fierce cruell Lion would not haue done ſo great hurtes, as Commodus committed as a Lion, but counterfect. With many other vaine and wicked déedes vnworthie to be written.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XIII. ¶ A diſcourſe of the prouinces that rebelled in his reigne, and the prodigies of his death.
               THere rebelled againſt the Romane Empire, in the reigne of Commodus, the Mauritanes, the Datians, the Sarmatians, and the Germaines, all which were onely

come by the Romane capiteines: for that Commodus did rather imploy his valiauntneſſe in vices, then in reſiſting enimies. Hée was not onely in his woordes and workes, vaine and friuolous, but alſo in his letters which hée wrote for the Empire: for that many times being aduertiſed frō countries and prouinces, of cauſes of great importance, he would anſweare them with matters of vanitie: and ſometimes would ſende an whole ſhéete of paper ſealed and firmed, conteyning onely one Latine woord, that is to ſay, Vale. Notwithſtanding the dayes of his reigne were the moſt vnfortunate dayes, yet would hee néedes commaund them to be termed ye golden world. Moſt heynous offences hée would pardon for monie: if any perſon being abſent were condemned to die, hée would finde out ſome other of his age and name, to be executed for his offence: affirming that ſince he did reſemble him in age and name, hée ſhould not varie in the maner of his death: in ſuch wiſe, that this tyrant did kill innocents for the wicked, and let offenders eſcape for monie. If any man had an enimie of whom he would take vengeaunce, hée néeded no other meane to performe the ſame, but to bargaine with Commodus for a ſumme of monie, which being agréed he neuer wanted occaſion to rid him of his life. At all the vile and filthie déeds which Commodus committed, he was not gréeued, but delighted in the publication thereof: in ſo much that he was not onely euil, but alſo boaſted himſelfe to be euill: for that he entred ſo great follie or madnes, that all thinges which hée either did, or ſaid, whether allowed or miſliked of himſelfe or all other men, expreſſely hee commaunded them to
be written, in the regiſtre Capitoline. On a certeine time he determined to burne ye whole citie of Rome: and being preſt to giue fire to many parts, Letus a Conſul came vnto him, and ſaid vnto him ſo many things, and put him in ſo great feare of the hazard of his life, that he ceaſed that day to execute ſo deſperate a déed: and being demaunded, why hée would burne his mother Rome, aunſweared: that he would not burne Rome, but his Commodian Colonell:
                     
becauſe at that time it was named Rome. Theſe prodigies following did precede his death. There came out of his houſe certeine little birds, of the faſhion and colour of turtles: which were neuer ſéene either in Rome, or in any the confines of Italie, and remained iij. dayes vppon his houſe, neither flying or remouing to any other houſe: and their note and ſonge which they vſed, did rather giue motion of wéeping, then of mirth. Soudeinly the ports of Ianus did open, the copper Image of the god Mercurie was ſéene to ſweat, the Image of Hercules without approch of any perſon was ſéene to moue, and vppon his chamber where hée ſlept the ſkrich owle nightly ceaſed not to houle. Commodus cōſidering theſe cauſes, departed to remaine at mount Celius: affirming that he was feared by night, &amp; might not ſléepe. On the next day, being demaunded for the celebration of certeine feaſtes &amp; games, which were to be done before the gates of his Palace, what garmentes his guard ſhould weare, hée aunſwered and commaunded them to be clad with hooded capes for the raine, a garment much vſed in Rome for mourners: in ſuch wiſe that on the other day hée was in ſuch maner accompanied, that it ſeemed rather they wente to honour his obſequies, then to celebrate or magnifie his feaſtes.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XIIII. ¶ Howe Commodus was ſlaine by the deuice and counſel of his Courtiſane Martia.
               THe time approching, wherein the follies and wickedneſſes of the Emperour Commodus ſhould finiſh, and the ſorrowfull Rome obteine libertie from the ſeruitude of ſo cruell a tyrant: the occaſion both of the one and the other was after this maner.
               
                  
                  The firſt day of the moneth of Ianuary, the Romanes did celebrate the feaſt of the God Ianus: on which day Commodus determined to ſhewe himſelfe in the habite, not of an Emperour, but of a ſword player: whereof Martia his cōcubine being aduertiſed, with great inſtāce did humblie pray him, and with many teares no leſſe requeſt and béeſeech him, that it might pleaſe him to take ſome other order, both to auoyde the perill that might happen vnto his perſon, as alſo the blemiſhe vnto his authoritie. This Martia was ſo loued and ſo tenderly cheriſhed and honoured of the Emperour Commodus, that notwithſtanding ſhée did ſerue him as a concubine, yet hée brought to paſſe that all men did ſerue her as Empreſſe. To reſtraine Cō
                        modus from that feaſt in the ſhewe and forme of a ſword-player, neither were the abundant teares powred forth of Martia ſufficient, either her humble ſute ſo inſtantly requeſted, either the feare and hazard of his perſon ſo flatly informed, either the amorous intiſementes ſo exactly performed, remoue his purpoſe: the which Martia conſidering, forgat not to requeſt others to be aſſiſtant in that ſute: for as afterwardes ſhée reported, her heart did giue her, that Commodus that day ſhould paſſe great perill. At that time Letus was his Chamberlaine, and Electus Capiteine of his guard, whoe were priuate and in great fauour with the Emperour Commodus, &amp; friendes vnto Martia: theſe both ſhée requeſted to be humble furtherers in her former ſute. But Commodus was ſo obſtinate, and determined to celebrate that feaſt of Ianus, in forme of a fenſer: that he was not onely vnwilling to heare them, but alſo grew to be offended with them. On the eues eue of the great feaſt of the God Ianus, Commodus cōmaunded the Capiteines of the ſword players, to prepare him the armes &amp; enſignes of a ſword player: for that hée would celebrate thoſe feaſts not as an Emperour, but as a ſwoord player. This done and prouided, Commodus cōmaunded Letus and Electus to depart to their lodging, to the end he might repoſe: and ſéeing himſelfe alone in his chamber incloſed with doores

ſhut, he tooke paper and incke, and did write with his owne handes, the names of all ſuch perſons which he determined on the next day ſhould be ſlaine with the ſwoord players: for his meaning was not principally to adorne thoſe feaſtes and to honour them, but to diſpatch manye men of their liues. This memorial being made, of al ſuch perſons as the nexte day ſhoulde be ſlaine: partely of exceſſe, and partely of wearineſſe in writinge, he was taken with deade ſleape: laying his memoriall vnder his pillowe, not doubting that any perſon ſhould encounter therewith. Commodus had in his chamber a little boye ſufficiently faire, named Pugius, whome he did loue and fauour aboue all the reſt, not for his ſeruice, but for delight he had of him in bedde. As Pugius was but childiſhe, and in ſo greate fauour, comming and going alwayes into Commodus chamber, fortune would, or to ſay better, God ſo ordayned, that he ſhoulde take that paper in hande wherein were contained the names of al ſuch as were appointed to the ſlaughter: and came forth vnto the lodging, where Martia receiued him to play, according vnto the cuſtome vſed with children: and finding the paper in his handes, ſuſpecting it to be ſome writinge of importance, tooke the childe into her armes, imbracinge, kiſſinge, and dallying with the childe Pugius, and giuing him another iuell wherewith to play, tooke the paper into her hands, without all ſuſpicion to finde that, which therein was conteined. Martia coulde both write and reade, and vnderſtoode ye Gréeke, and ſpake the Latine toung, and preſently begane to reade the contents thereof, written by Commodus his owne handes: wherein ſhée founde firſte her owne proper name, as appointed amongſt the reſte to be ſlaine: the ſeconde was the chamberlaine Letus, the thirde the captaine Electus, and ſo conſequentely the moſt auncient, wealthy, &amp; the moſt noble perſonages of Rome, Martia being aſtonnied and terrified to find what ſhe foūd in that libell, began to ſobbe and wéepe: and ſaying with her ſelfe: what is this? may it be, that I am Martia that

reade this writing, and ſhalbe executed to morrowe? Oh Commodus, ioy &amp; take no care: for whereas thou hadſt thought to haue done vengeaunce vppon thine enimies: this daye, they ſhal be reuenged of thee, in ſuche wife, as men ſhall praiſe it, and the Gods allowe it: that in thy rigorous chaſticements, all tyraunts ſhall obteine and recouer both warning and example.
                  
                  If thou euer in all thy life, dideſt committ or perfourme any good deede, it hath beene to place mee amongſt ſuche perſones as thou haſt appointed to be ſlaine to morowe: for that ſhee deſerueth moſte iuſtly to dye, that abandoneth her conuerſation vnto ſo vile a perſon. Since the Gods haue ſo permitted, and my good fortune woulde, that this matter ſhould be diſcouered, full contrarie to thy purpoſe, it ſhall haue ſucceſſe: becauſe thou thoughteſt to haue ſlaine mee, and all other vertuous, noble, and moſt wealthie of the Empire: but the caſe ſhall be thus: that this daye thou ſhalt ſee the ende of thy wicked life, and wee all ſhall beholde our mother Rome ſet at libertie.
               
               
                  Theſe and ſuche other woordes being ſpoken, ſhée ſent for Letus and Electus, to whome in greate ſecrecie, ſhée ſhewed this writing: and when they conſidered, that on the next daye they ſhoulde all be ſlaine, they forgate not to determine to kill Commodus that night: but hardely might agree vppon the deuice and manner of his death.
               
               
                  It was the euen of the feaſt of Ianus, and alſo a great parte of the daye alreadie paſt, and not as yet determined with what manner of death they ſhoulde finiſhe Commodus his life: for that, if they ſhoulde kill him on the ſoudeine, he might defende him ſelfe, and the caſe diſcouered: and if their affaires were deferred, on the next daye they were iudged to dye: but finally, they concluded to diſpatche him with poiſon, offered by the hands of Martia. The manner was thus.
               
               
                  
                     Martia perſuaded Commodus that night to bathe him ſelfe, and comming from the bathe, Martia bare

him in hande that he was pale and colourleſſe, and prayed him to drinke and to eate a morſell, and in that ſame whiche ſhée gaue him in a colation to eate, in the ſame ſhée miniſtred poiſon for him to dye.
               
               
                  Not long after this ſurfeting dyet, his head began to ake: and being counſelled by Martia to take his bedde, ſhée prouided to ſende foorth all perſones that might ſeeme either to hinder his reſt, or her determined purpoſe. He had repoſed little more then an houre, when the poiſon began to come to his heart, and taking occaſion with his fingers to caſt, Martia, Letus, &amp; Electus, doubting that by vomite he might throwe foorth the poiſon, and ſo they by matter committed might iuſtly be put to death, beganne to féare and diſmaye in their enterpriſe. But Martia more like a man then a woman, perceiuing her complaintes to be daunted with feare, brought in Narciſſus, a beardleſſe and ſhameleſſe young man, fleſhed in murthers: to whome ſhée promiſed a greate ſumme of money, who entring the chamber finiſhed the murther. This was the ende of the vnchaſt and filthie life of Commodus, whoſe life and death may yealde vnto all Princes bothe example and terrour: for, notwithſtanding the wicked are forborne for a time, yet Gods iuſtice doth not permitte them to eſcape vnpuniſhed.

               CHAP. I. ¶Of the linage and countrie of the Emperour Pertinax.
               
                  THE emperour Publius Pertinax was borne in the prouince of Apennia in a certeine place named Martos, in the ſecond yere of the Empire of Traiane: and his father was named Lineotinus, a man that liued by his owne proper ſweate and trauaile. Pertinax beeing a ſtripling, ſerued his father with the carriage of wood vpō an aſſe, to be ſolde at the towne, who vſed to ſell ſo déere, contentious, and pinching, that if they gaue him not his firſt demaunde, he did rather leaue his wood vnſolde, then abate one blanke of his price. And being noted of all men, and but for a packeman, it procéeded thereof to be named Pertinax, that is to ſay, contentious: for that before time he was named Publius. Pertinax perceiuing that he was now called, not Publius, but Pertinax, contentious and packman, he parted from his countrie in a greate chafe, and ſhamed, giuing him ſelfe to write and read: whiche when he had learned, he traueiled to atteine the Gréeke &amp; Latine tounges, which alſo he obteined: in ſuch wiſe, that he became more handſome in ſcience, then in ſelling of wood. Nowe when Pertinax perceiued him ſelfe to be inſtructed bothe in the Gréeke and Latine tounges, he gaue him ſelfe vnto the warres, to learne the arte of warrefare,

perceiuing that from his ſtudie there procéeded much traueile, and no profit: and that his life diminiſhed, and his goods nothing increaſed. In thoſe dayes the Romaines helde warres with the Aſſyrians, againſt whome the Conſul Lolianus was capteine, where Pertinax being repaired, made couenant with a capteine of Rome to ſerue him for his prouiſion, in the condition of a cater: who vſing his ſeruice in that office verie faithfully, and in ſkirmiſhe and encounter with the enimie no leſſe valiantly, his maiſter remoued from his ſaide office, and aduaunced him to the ſtate of a Souldiour. Not long after that Pertinax had ſerued in the condition of a ſouldiour, but he was raiſed to an office of more honour and credite, which in theſe dayes, is termed Sergeant of the hande, that is to wéete, to giue order vnto the ſouldiours, to ſette in arraye. Pertinax euery daye recouered fame in the warres, and his valiantneſſe and noble minde was notorious vnto all men in the campe. It chaunced at the furious encounter of the enimie, the capteine of his hande to be ſlaine: whereof the Conſul Lolianus commaunded him to take the charge, wherein he did ſo behaue him ſelf, that not long after, he did not onely with bloud, reuenge the bloud of his capteine, but alſo brought to paſſe, to be loued of the Romaines, and feared of the enimies. The warres of Aſſyria being finiſhed, Pertinax remained as pretor thereof, and as he was feared of the Aſſyrians in the time of warre: ſo was he afterwardes beloued in time of peace: for if in times paſt he had béene rigorous, as vnto enimies: ſo was he in proceſſe without all compariſon, more pittifull vnto offenders. In the ſeconde yeare of the Empire of ye good Marcus Aurelius, the king of Parthians rebelled againſt the Romanes, &amp; amongſt other Capteines that were called vnto that conqueſt, was Pertinax the Pretor of Aſſyria: in which warres, ſo ſtraight and ſound frindſhip was planted betwixt Marcus Aurelius and Pertinax, that from thenceforth they dealte not as maiſter and ſeruaunt, but as father and ſonne: becauſe no matter,

were it of moſte greate importance whiche Marcus Aurelius commaunded, that Pertinax perfourmed not, and exactly did not accompliſhe: either any counſell miniſtred by Pertinax vnto Marcus Aurelius, vnto whiche he yealded not. In thoſe Parthian warres, Pertinax proued ſo prouident in perils, ſo doughtie in hazardes, ſo wiſe in counſell, ſo venturous in ſallies, and ſo valiant in battaile, that by reporte of the enimies and iudgement of the armies, he onely deſerued more glorie then all the reſt. The warres of Aſia being finiſhed, the Emperour Marcus Aurelius ſente him as Pretor vnto the prouince of great Britaine, which nowe is called Englande.
               Two yeares after he arriued into Britaine, warre was raiſed againſt the Germaines, vnto which warres Pertinax was alſo called, and there had the charge of the Eagle, which was to be bearer of the royall ſtandarde, and was called the Eagle, becauſe the Romanes had alwayes in that ſpeciall ſtandard an Eagle brauely painted.
               
                  
                     Pertinax being reſident in the warres of Germanie, his owne mother from Rome, came to viſite him, for that tenne yeres had paſſed in whiche ſhée had not ſéene him: and not tenne dayes after ſhée had inioyed the ſight of her deſired ſonne, ſhée dyed and paſſed out of this worlde. Vnto whom Pertinax erected ſo ſolemne and ſumptuous obſequies, and ſo generous a ſepulchre, whereof was diuined that ſhée was the mother of ſome Emperour to come, and that the Empire ſhould fall into his handes.
The affaires of Germanie being ſettled, the Emperour Marcus Aurelias ſent his commaundement vnto Pertinax, to paſſe into Datia, which nowe is named Denmarke: and did aſſigne him fiftie thouſande ſextercies for his ſtipend, whiche may amount to fiue thouſande Ducates of our money: whereat manye did enuie, no leſſe for the greate ſummies of money which he gaue him, then for the honourable gouernement that he committed vnto him.
               
                  Nowe Pertinax being growen verie riche, and notified bothe valiant, hardie, and in greate eſtimation, hee was there withall enuied of manie: which hatred borne him by his contemporants and companions in the warrs, they diſcouered by their extreme publiſhing his negligences, darkening and inféebling his heroicall actes.
               
                  It is an auncient cuſtome in the malice of man, to holde nothing for well done, but that which we loue, although it be euil: and to eſteeme nothinge for euill, but that which we hate, although it be right perfect. There came from Datia certeine ſouldiours to Rome, whiche gaue foorth ſo peruerſe and foule information againſte Pertinax, that preſently the Emperour did ſuſpende his office, and diſcharged him of his ſtipende, and that he ſhoulde ſerue one whole yeare at his owne proper coſtes in Illyria.
               
               This imperiall commaundement being notified vnto Pertinax, preſently with greate patience he obeyed, and departed vnto Illyria to perfourme his baniſhement with much conſtancie: and they ſaye, that he ſaide theſe words at his departing.
               
                  I am not grieued for the honour whereof they haue depriued mee, either for the ſtipende which they haue taken from mee, either of this exile whiche they haue ſent mee: but it grieueth mee that this commaundement ſhuld proceede from ſo good a Prince, and I not hearde, either he well infourmed: becauſe mine innocencie being knowen (as ſhortly it ſhalbe knowen) the Emperour, my Lord, ſhalbe noted of all men, as a Prince of light beliefe, and I ſhall obteine the credite and fame of a gentleman, bothe ſincere and patient.
               
               And as Pertinax ſaid, ſo it ſucceded, which is to wéete: the Senate commaunding inquiſition to be made, and finding Pertinax frée and cleare from all matters, wherof he was accuſed, and manye thinges wherefore to be commaunded, he was by publique ſentence reſtored vnto his honour, &amp; to his aduerſaries was giuen the paine that

he did and ſhoulde haue ſuffered: although, notwithſtanding in ſhort time after, by his owne ſute, they were pardoned, becauſe Pertinax naturally was pittifull, and not giuen to reuenge.
            
            
               CHAP. II. ¶Of the variable fortune that Pertinax did paſſe before he obteined the Empire.
               THE emperour Marcus Aurelius helde Pertinax in reputation of a man both vertuous, valiant, ſilent, of a noble minde, and alſo fortunate: but after he had by falſe report exiled him, he helde him both for wiſe, and of great patience, conſidering howe mildly he endured ſo vniuſt baniſhment, and afterwardes howe friendly he ſued for his aduerſaries. In recompence of the iniurie whiche Marcus Aurelius the Emperour had done vnto Pertinax, he made him Pretor of Datia, and ſent him ioyntly with his prouiſion, the enſigne, and did alſo conſtitute him capteine of the firſt legion: that is to ſaye, to haue the vauntgarde of the armie, which in the warres is a matter of moſte truſt, and alſo of honour: in ſuche wiſe, that where as his enimies had thought moſte to haue confounded him, from thence he receiued occaſion to be moſt aduaunced. The prouince of Noricus and Retius rebelled againſt the Romaines: againſt whome the armies of Illyria were ſent, vnto whome they gaue aduertiſement that they were readie to be reduced vnto the ſeruice of the Romaine Empire, if the Pretor that preſently did gouerne them were remoued, and in his place they might obteine Pertinax for their Protector: ſaying and affirming, that they rebelled not, to retire from the ſubiection of Rome: but becauſe their officers did oppreſſe them with cruell dealing. Great ioye had the Emperour Marcus Aurelius when he vnderſtood thoſe prouinces to be reduced vnto his

ſeruice: but much more did he reioyce, when he was aduertiſed, howe inſtantly they craued Pertinax for the gouernement of that countrie: vnto whome preſently he ſent, both crauing and commaunding: and to the ende that Pertinax ſhoulde accept his ſuite, and condeſcende vnto his commaundement, he ſent him the enſigne and liuerie of Conſulſhip. Many dayes after that theſe matters had paſſed, the Emperour Marcus Aurelius ſent for Pertinax, which had béene abſent ſixtéene yeares, and as he was in martial affaires, famous, ſo generally they came foorth into the ſtréetes of Rome to beholde him, as it had béene ſome monſter, brought from the deſertes of Aegypt: and being arriued at Rome, he was conducted by the Emperour Marcus Aurelius vnto the Senate: and after all ſortes and faſhions was praiſed and honoured as an aſſured friende doeth vſe to praiſe and honour his approued friende, which was great noueltie in Rome: that is to ſaye, for one Prince to ſpeake for another in the Senate: for vnto ſuch like Capteines as vnto Pertinax, they did onely heare what they would ſaye, but vſed not to aunſwere any one woorde within the Senate. Preſently in the Kalendes of Ianuary next enſuing, Pertinax was created Conſul: which the Emperour wiſhed the Senate had not perfourmed, to the ende he woulde haue made him Pretor principall, becauſe he eſtéemed him to be in poſſeſſion of greate wiſedome, for gouernement of matters of the common wealth, and very vpright to adminiſter iuſtice. The people inhabitant neare vnto Danubie, did write vnto the Emperour Marcus Aurelius, howe they were robbed, loſt, and euil gouerned: and that if Pertinax were not ſent to gouerne that prouince, er long the whole countrie would rebell: which Marcus Aurelius vnderſtanding, framed and forced him to returne vnto Danubie: and to the ſame ende he gaue him power and ſtipende ſo accompliſhed, that he reſerued vnto him ſelfe but onely the name of Emperour his Lord,
               One yere after that Pertinax had gouerned Danubie,
                  
the Senate ſent him newe prouiſion for the gouernement of Datia, by the occaſion of the death of Caſsius: and that alſo he ſhould vſe the reſidence of the Pretor of Panonia: in ſuche wiſe, that there was no matter, either in the inferiour or higher Almaine, that by the handes of Pertinax was not gouerned and prouided. Two yeares after the death of the Emperour Marcus Aurelius, Pertinax was remoued from the gouernement of Germanie, and aſſigned vnto Syria: the gouernement whereof was the beſt, the moſt honourable, and alſo the moſte profitable that was giuen by the Romanes: 
                  for that it was not beſtowed, but vppon the moſte auncient Conſul, or the moſte valiant capteine, or the moſte graue Senatour, or the ambaſſadour
that heſt had perfourmed his charge. All the life of the good Emperour Marcus Aurelius, Pertinax in all his offices was founde to be verie wiſe, verie iuſt, ſeuere, and no leſſe ſincere: but after the good Emperour was dead, he grewe negligent, and alſo was noted with the blemiſhe of a nigarde, and couetouſneſſe, becauſe from thenceforth, he did rather imploye his forces to gather richeſſe, then to gouerne the common wealth.
Of this notable example it may be inferred, of that which euerye day we ſée to chaunce: which is, that good Princes, of euil men make good ſeruauntes, and euil Princes of good men, make euil ſeruauntes: for that many times, notwithſtanding the ſeruaunt naturally be euil, he doth endeuour and enforce him ſelfe to be good, in reſpect of his maiſter which is good: and ſo by the contrarie, if the Prince be euil, the ſeruaunt ſtrayeth vnto euill, although of his owne nature he be good.
               
               Nowe Commodus being Emperour in Rome, when Pertinax bribed, and gathered money in Aſia, againſte whome certeine people did riſe and mutine, exclaming that he helde them oppreſſed and robbed, he was conſtrained thereby to retyre vnto Rome, to eſcape their pretented practiſes, to diſpatche him of his life: nothing diſpleaſant vnto Commodus, to the ende he might inherite

his goods.
               
                  Pertinax being come to Rome, and the tyraunt Perennius in thoſe dayes gouerning the Empire, and commaunding Commodus, gaue him verie euill entertaynement, and woorſe conuerſation: not for that Pertinax had ſo deſerued, but the rather to giue him occaſion to departe from Rome: for that being (as he was) verie wiſe, and of great iudgement, valiant, riche, and alſo auncient: he doubted to bée depriued by Pertinax from the fauour of Commodus.
               
               
                  
                     Pertinax beholding the follies of Commodus, the tyrannies of Perennius, the loſſe and ſpoyle of the common wealth of Rome: aduiſed to departe from thence, and to goe vnto the countrie of Liguria, ſeparating him ſelfe to liue in a poore village, where in times paſt, his father had liued and kepte ſhoppe: and buying that poore dwelling, where his father had ſolde oyle, fiſhe, wine, bread, and other victualls, buylt in the compaſſe thereof a ſtately buylding, permitting the olde to remaine in the mideſt without any addition or diminiſhing thereof. Pertinax excéedingly delighted to beholde that countrie, wherein he had paſſed his life being but a childe, and from whence he had departed ſo abiect, and nowe returned with ſuche wealth and credite.
               
               
                  And being aduertiſed of the foale of the Aſſe, whereon he had vſed to carrie wood, to be aliue, he bought it, and did ſo vſe &amp; féede it, as it had béene ſome auncient ſeruaunt of great deſeruing. He there erected manye and ſolemne buyldinges, bought great and many purchaſes, gaue great ſummes of money vnto his kinred, old friends, and acquaintaunce: and did ſo ioye to ſée him ſelfe ſo riche, where he had béene ſo poore, and to obteine ſo great quietneſſe, after ſo muche trauaile: that he ſaide, and wrote vnto his friendes, that if Princes had throughly taſted and knowen the relliſhe of repoſed reſt: of them ſelues, and of their owne proper will, they would abandon their Empires.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Pertinax being ſetled in quietneſſe, Commodus ſent his commaundement, that he ſhoulde departe into Britaine to execute the office of Pretor: which he obeyed, more for feare then of good will, and preſently began to reforme the armies: whiche were in robberies verie abſolute, and of life no leſſe diſſolute. And on a time a certeine mutinous legion made commotion, not becauſe they had contention amongeſt them ſelues, but early to awake Pertinax, to violate his life. The matter fell out after this manner, that Pertinax found him ſelfe in ſo great perill, that all men thought he had béene ſlaine: yet amongſt the dead he eſcaped aliue, notwithſtanding cruelly wounded. After theſe matters were pacified, and Pertinax cured of his woundes, hee ſo ſeriouſly chaſticed that treaſon which they had conſpired againſt him, that he miniſtred matter to murmur at Rome, and to bewaile in Britaine. The Senate being aduertiſed, what had paſſed betwixt the armie and Pertinax, ſent a ſuſpenſe of, and for his pretorian office, and gaue him charge of prouiſion for victuals and munition, whiche he woulde not accept, but ſued for his diſcharge to departe: for that the armies helde him extreme and cruell, and he of the armies had greate doubt and ſuſpicion. Pertinax being arriued at Rome, founde that Perennius the tyraunt was nowe dead: and Pertinax being a man of authoritie and grauitie, a ſmall time fell into the fauour of Commodus, vnto whome he commended the prefecture or gouernement of the citie of Rome: and ſuccéeding Fuſsianus whoe vſed his office with great crueltie, Pertinax obteined greate good liking of all the people, who perfourmed his charge with no leſſe mildneſſe and pietie.
               
                  Commodus not contented that Pertinax had recouered ſo greate fauour in the common wealth, and finding no occaſion either to kill or baniſhe him, aduiſed to diſcouer his euill will whiche he did beare him, bothe in worde and déede, that of him ſelfe he would ſéeke occaſion to departe frō 
                  Rome: who finding apt &amp; ſure meanes

to renounce his office, retired vnto his owne proper houſe and countrie, ſuppoſing neuer more to haue béene remoued from thence all the dayes of his life: partely, for that he perceiued howe Commodus ſought occaſions to take away his life: and partly moued of olde age, to repoſe the remnant of his dayes.
            
            
               CHAP. III. ¶What was ſaide, and what he aunſwered vnto thoſe perſons, that offered him the Empire.
               AFter that Martia, Letus, Electus, and Narciſſus had ſlaine the Emperour Commodus, a greate parte of the night being paſſed, and all perſons in ye palace being couched vnder the gouernement of profound ſléepe, Martia and her companions tooke the carkaſe of Commodus, and wrapt it in an olde Seron, wherein the ſlaues did beare out the ordure of the ſtable: giuing them to vnderſtande, that it was a certeine veſſel, with a charge alſo to carrie it forth. After the bodie was remoued out of the courte, they laide it into a carre, and conueyed it into a certeine village named Ariſtro where Commodus did vſe to bathe and ſolace: but on the next daye his death being publiſhed, the Romanes purſued, and although he were dead, they cutt off his head, and trailed his bodie throughout all the ſtréetes of Rome. Martia, Letus, and Electus, conſidering they had ſlaine Commodus, and beſtowed his carkaſe at their pleaſure, aduiſed amongeſt them ſelues to ſéeke out, and to name an Emperour before daye ſhoulde come vppon them: to the ende the Empire ſhould haue an owner, as alſo to haue defence vnder his protection: and ſo it came to paſſe, when the death of the one was manifeſted, the election of the other was publiſhed.
               
                  the matter hapned after this manner: Letus and Electus talkinge with them, certeine of their eſpeciall frindes departed ſtreight vnto the houſe of Pertinax, knocking at the gate to haue it opened with greate haſte: one of the ſonnes of Pertinax beholding them to come armed, at ſuch an hour, and with ſuch haſt, was taken with ſo great feare, that when he woulde haue made reporte thereof vnto his father, terrour and trembling woulde not ſuffer him to ſpeake.
               At the inſtant that Pertinax vnderſtood how Letus and Electus were come with armed men, he leapt from his bedde and commaunded his gates with greate ſpede to be opened, which procéeded of a noble and a valiaunt minde, for that he helde it for moſt certaine, that for as much as they were both ſo priuate with Commodus, who did beare him ſo mortall hatred, and comming vnto his houſe at ſuche an houre, might be to no other end then to take away his life. And all the time whileſt theſe matters did paſſe betwixt the one and the other parte, Pertinax was neither troubled or altered: but after the maner of a man determined to die, ſaide vnto Letus and Electus theſe woordes.
               
                  I do well vnderſtande that the Emperour Commodus, my Lord, hath ſente to kill me, whereof I doe not meruel: but wonder it is, that ſo long he ſuffered me to liue: becauſe of all the olde ſeruants that were bred with his father Marcus Aurelius I onelie am aliue, a ſmall remnant of all the reſte whiche hee hath ſlaine. I may not with reaſon complaine me, ye Commodus in my quietneſſe and ſecuritie doth ſend to put me to death, ſince certaine dayes paſt, I haue attēded this laſt day &amp; houre: for that abhorring, as I did abhorre his wicked life, I was moſte ſure hee

woulde procure my death. It grieueth me not to die, but for that I die before I ſee my countrie deliuered from the handes of ſo cruell a tyrant: for I ſweare vnto you by the immortall Godds, that I neuer wiſhed anie thinge rather vnto my ſelfe, either my poſteritie, then that it might pleaſe them, before they woulde take away my life I might beholde my mother Rome ſet at libertie. I haue been a right perfect and ſincere Romaine, and zealous for the common wealth of my countrie, and doe hope in the immortall Godds, that I ſhall obteine that in their preſence whiche they haue denyed mee in their abſence, before whome, his malice and mine innocencie ſhalbe examined. You Letus, and Electus, ſeruauntes, friendes, and fauoured with Commodus, doe that whiche he hath commaunded you, and diſpatche mee out of this tedious and miſerable worlde: for in the ende to dye with the ſwoorde, or to dye with an ague, all is but death.
               
               
                  Letus and Electus were aſtonnied to beholde the conſtancie that Pertinax had, and to conſider the excellent woordes whiche he ſaide: whereunto they made aunſwere.
               
                  Oh, howe ſecrete are the iudgementes of God, and howe variable are the thoughtes of menne. This wee ſaye vnto thee Pertinax, becauſe thou thinkeſt that wee are come to take awaye thy life: and wee are not come, but to the ende thou ſhouldeſt giue vs life, and take wretched Rome

vnder thy defence.
               
               
                  Wee may not ſpeake or aduertiſe thee at large, for want of time, the breake of day being at hande: but the caſe is thus, that the tyrante Commodus is deade, the cauſe thereof proceeded, for that he had determined (as was founde in memoriall written with his owne handes) this day to haue ſlaine vs all: and as by a certaine manner neuer harde of, the matter was diſcouered, we determined to preſerue our own liues, and giue an ende to his tyrannies. In this deed which we haue done, we neither thinke to haue offended the Gods, or committed treaſon: for that the life of this tyrant was odious vnto the Gods, and daungerous vnto men. It was nowe high time that ſome man ſhoulde giue an ende vnto his life, that had taken away the life of ſo many good men. We, as we were in his fauour, had perfect intelligēce, whom he helde for friends, or enimies: and alſo we knowe right certeinely, that if thou Pertinax be now aliue, it is not, that he ſo wiſhed it, or that he procured not to kil thee, but the Gods gaue him no place, but haue reſerued thee to the ende thou ſhouldeſt deliuer Rome, and reſtore the common wealth.
               
               
                  No man knoweth vnto this houre that Cōmodus is dead, but Martia and we that haue ſlaine him: and as we haue laide our handes vpon him to finiſhe his dayes, ſo haue we fixed our eyes vpon thee to make thee Emperour.
               
               
                  And beleeue vs, Pertinax, that if we coulde haue made choice of any better then thy ſelfe, we woulde haue choſen better: becauſe they are ſo many and ſo greate euills which haue beene committed by this tyrant, that they may not be amended or repayred,

but by the hands of ſome moſt vertuous prince. That which hath moued vs to elect and giue thee this Empire, is, becauſe thou art auncient, wiſe, valiaunt, vertuous, riche, and of great experience, aboue all the reſt loued &amp; deſired of all the people: for that Prince whiche is not acceptable vnto his people, he ſhal of many be diſobeyed &amp; of many much leſſe duely eſteemed.
               
               
                  Theſe woordes being noted of Pertinax, determinatly did thincke them to be ſpoken fainedly and with colluſion, and thereto aunſweared. Oh Letus and thou Electus, you ought to be ſatiſfied, ſimply to accompliſh the vniuſt commaundement of Commodus, without deriſion of theſe my poore auncient yeres, yt is to ſay, firſt gilefully to flatter me and afterwards to kill mée. As I haue ſaid, performe that which ye haue to doe, which the ſooner ye ſhall accompliſh, the greater ioy ſhal ye yéeld vnto Commodus, and deliuer me of griefe. I well know that Commodus now ſléepeth not, but carefully abideth your returne, for at this preſent he attēdeth no better newes, then the report, that ye haue giuen an end vnto my wretched life. Letus and Electus conſidering that Pertinax continued doubtful and ſuſpicious, began to ſay and replie: there is ſo ſmall time for ſo great affaires as wée haue to do, that there reſteth no time to contend vpon our ambaſſage and thy ſuſpicion: and becauſe thou ſhalt ſée the truthe of that which we haue ſaid, and not as thou ſuppoſeſt, take and reade this memoriall, written with Commodus his owne hand, and there ſhalt thou ſée, how great reaſon wée had to kill him this night, ſince to morrow he ment to haue ſlaine vs all. Pertinax receiuing the memorial into his hands, and knowing it to be Commodus writing, found himſelfe placed in the fourth degrée, which is to witt, that on the morrowe Commodus would haue killed Martia, Letus, Electus and Pertinax: &amp; ſo by degrées, many other Senators &amp; Conſuls of Rome. Pertinax hauing read ye memoriall, ſtayed as one aſtonied

againe demaunding if Commodus were dead in déede: they aduouched no leſſe, and thoroughly affirmed the ſame: whereuppon hee beganne moſt pitiouſly to wéepe: ſaying, that he wept not for the death of Commodus, but becauſe the memorie of the good Marcus Aurelius in him was finiſhed.
And lifting his eyes vp to heauen, ſaid: Oh vnfortunate Marcus Aurelius, Oh vnfortunate Marcus Aurelius, Oh infortunate Marcus Aurelius: (thrée times exclaming him to be vnfortunate and vnhappie) becauſe thou waſt vnfortunate in thy wife, whiche thou poſſeſſedſt: in thy daughters which thou nouriſhedſt, &amp; in thy ſonnes which thou begattedſt.
               
            
            
               CHAP. IIII. ¶ A certeine notable ſpeach vttered by Letus vnto the armie, in the fauour of Pertinax.
               AFter that Pertinax had bewayled the death of Commodus, not for his owne condition, but for that he had béene the ſonne of the good Marcus Aurelius, hée ſaid vnto Letus &amp; Electus, that he would not by any meane receiue the Empire, if the Senate did not commaund it, and the armie conſent vnto it: becauſe to hold the Empire ſafe and eſtabliſhed, and not to enter the ſame as a tyrant: vnto the Senate, it apperteyned to vſe their election, and the armie their confirmation. Letus made offer to finiſhe all that which Pertinax demaunded: that is to ſay, the Senate ſhould elect and chooſe him, &amp; the armie confirme and allow their election: and the hope that he had to obteine the ſame was, that hée had amongeſt them many friends and kinſefolke: and the ioy that all would receiue vppon the newes of his death. Letus departing to talke with the Capteines and leaders of the armie, made vnto them a compendious ſpeach after this manner.
               
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           His Oration to the aſſemblie.
                           
                           THAT which now I meane to ſay (right excellent Princes, and my martial companions) will be verie ſtraunge vnto your hearing, although not farre diſtant from your deſires: becauſe of many things whiche we deſire, the leaſt and feweſt parts thereof we do obteine. Neither are the Gods ſo liberall to giue vs al that we deſire, either ſo niggard to denie vs all that we craue: and this they do, becauſe we ſhal acknowledge them to be good, for that which they giue vs: and cō
                              feſſe our ſelues to be euill for that which they denie vs. The good and vertuous be not onely knowen, in the good woorkes which they doe, but alſo in their good deſires which they haue: becauſe the euill and wicked, if they durſt, would neuer ceaſe to commit miſchiefe: and the vertuous if they might would neuer growe cold in doing vertuous acts. The Gods neuer ioyntly accompliſhed the deſires of ſo many, as this day they haue accompliſhed all your deſires: for being (as you are) noble, generous, valiaunt, true, and no counterfect Romanes: it is not to be thought that ye ſhould wiſh or deſire, but the libertie of our mother Rome, and the reformation of our auncient common wealthe.
                           Ye haue all ſeene what the Emperour Commodus hath beene, whiche is to witt, howe large in commaundement, howe cruell in killing, howe careleſſe in gouernment, &amp; how filthie of life: through which

cauſe, we not onely held our houſes as conſumed &amp; loſt, and our perſons in perill, but alſo were defamed throughout all ſtraunge nations. The Prince that is ouer youthly, fooliſh, abſolute or diſſolute, looſeth his people, and defameth his kingdome. Since ye haue ſeene the euils and cruelties which hee hath done, I would haue you ſee, heare, &amp; vnderſtād, what he mēt to doe: for as it ſeemeth by this memoriall written with his owne hand, hee had a will to haue ſlaine all perſons within the Empire: and if hee might haue brought it to paſſe, it is credible, he would haue cut the throtes of ſo many as be in this world. It was neuer ſeene or heard off in this world, of any tyraunte that hath beene of the maner and condition of Commodus: for that naturally he delighted in loſſe of friends, and did glorie to haue enimies. Commodus your Emperour is now dead, &amp; if I be not deceiued, I ſuppoſe he dieth with conformitie of the whole Empire: becauſe there is nothing more certaine, then that hee which liueth to the preiudice of all men, ſhould die to the conformitie of all men. In as much as the Gods haue taken in good part to deliuer vs from the ſeruitude of this tyrant, it is neceſſary that another Emperour be prouided and choſen, and this election may indure no delay, but muſt be diſpatched at this inſtāt: becauſe otherwiſe, as the great dignitie of the empire, is a thing that many deſire, &amp; few deſerue: ſo it might happen that at the time wee would beſtowe the ſame vppon ſome vertuous man, it might be vſurped by ſome ſtraunge tyrant. If vnto euery man that is here preſent, we ſhould haue due reſpect, according to their deſeruing: I ſweare by the immortall Gods, wee ſhould want Empires, and not Emperours: but conſidering

the Empire is but one, &amp; is not to be giuen but vnto one, in the end none ſhall obteine the ſame, but he vnto whome the Gods ſhall aſſigne, and the deſtinies permit. The prince that ye haue to electe, ought (in my iudgement) to be natiue of your countrie: becauſe the prince that is not natiue but a ſtraunger, he ſhall rather firſt finiſhe his dayes, then attaine to the loue of his common wealth. Ye haue alſo to elect &amp; chuſe an Emperour, that poſſeſſeth age &amp; grauitie: for that it furthereth not a little the profit and reputation of the common wealth, to haue a beard on the face, &amp; hoarie haires on the head. Alſo it is right neceſſarie in the Emperour which ye ſhal elect, that he be no foole, either a coward: but that he be wiſe, pregnant, noble minded, &amp; of experience: becauſe in naturall ſcience, and long experience, the good gouernement of the whole common wealth doth conſiſt. Manifeſting my minde more clearely, I ſay againe vnto that which I haue ſaid: that if my opinion might be taken in this caſe, we ought to determine and fixe our eyes vppon Publius Pertinax, in whome concurre all the conditions aforeſaid: that is to ſay, naturalitie, age, grauitie, ſcience, and experience: &amp; that this is moſt true, there needeth no greater teſtimonie for the credite thereof, then that Commodus held him for his enimie. It is not to be thought, that the Gods in vaine, haue conſerued the life of Pertinax vntil this day, Commodus procuring by a thouſand meanes to put him to death: as it is moſt true, that of al the old ſeruaunts of his father by him ſlaine, onely Pertinax is reſerued aliue. As wee haue all wel knowen that be here preſent, that Pertinax hath been the man moſt afflicted, baniſhed, enuied, toyled, and perſecuted, of al the men that now

are aliue in this world: and ſurely it is a great argument, to thinke that for him, &amp; for no other the Empire hath beene reſerued: becauſe the Gods do neuer preſerue the life of any man amongeſt ſo many perils, but afterwards greatly they aduaunce him. Wee ought all to hold it for great good hap, and greatly to gratifie the gods in reſpecte of ſuch and ſo many as haue bin ſlaine in our common wealth, that we finde ſuch a prince for our mother Rome, whom they ſhal not aduenture to contemne, becauſe of his grauitie: neither be daūted with feare, for that he is noble minded: either noted of ſimplicitie, in as much, as hee is ſapient: neither accuſed of vice, for that he is vertuous: either reproued of feeblenes, becauſe he is repoſed: finally, no man may deceiue him in words, in ſo much as he hath experience of all thinges. O moſt excellent princes and my commilitants, I will ſay no more vnto you, but that, if ye may perſuade your ſelues to the election of Pertinax, ye ſhall not onely yeeld a good Emperour vnto your Common wealth, but alſo euerie man ſhall obteine in him, a father for his familie: for as he hath bin a leader vnto vs all, ſo he cānot deale with vs, but as with his children.
                        
                     
                  
               
               All the time that Letus was reaſoning theſe matters vnto the armie, they ſtoode all aſtonied and rapt: partly in hearing the memoriall, conteyning the treaſon that Commodus had ordeyned, &amp; partly for the newes of his death: and alſo in conſidering how aptly &amp; eloquently Letus had vſed his ſpeach in opening the matter. Preſently at the inſtant that Letus had finiſhed his talke, the whole armie began to ſay &amp; exclame: Viuat viuat Pertinax Auguſtus, whiche is to ſay, Long &amp; many yeares may Pertinax liue our Romane Emperour. All the principal of the armie departed

to viſite Pertinax at his owne houſe, &amp; found him not, but in the temple of victorie, and taking him vppon their ſhoulders they carried him about all Rome: and as it was then, as yet not throughly day, the towneſmen were abaſhed to heare ſuch newes: becauſe not knowing that Commodus was dead, they heard that Pertinax was proclaimed Emperour. The Romanes afterwardes did ſweare and affirme, that in long time paſt there was euer any newes diuulgate in Rome, that generally gaue ſo great ioy vnto all perſons, partly for the newes of Cōmodus death, as alſo for that ye good old Pertinax was made Emperour.
            
            
               CHAP. V. ¶ Of an Oration made by Pertinax in the Senate immediatly after he was elected Emperour.
               VEry great was the ioy that was manifeſted throughout all Rome, becauſe they had obteyned Pertinax for their Lord, and no leſſe was the heauineſſe that Pertinax diſcouered, to behold himſelfe an Emperour: for he ſaid, that this name or title of imperie or regiment, was the thing that euery man deſired for himſelf, and in others did moſt abhorre. No ſigne of an Emperour would Pertinax cōſent to accompanie him, vntil he and the Senatours had ſéene, conferred, and ſaluted ech other, and all ioyntly being mounted vpon the height of the Capitol, where ye imperial cloth of eſtate was placed, Pertinax would by no meane ſit downe in that imperial ſeat, but tooke the Conſul Glabriō
                   by the arme, and by ſtrong hand would haue ſet him in the ſame, ſeriouſly affirming, that it apperteined much better vnto his deſeruing. Glabrion was a Romane, in age very auncient, in cōdition very mild, in gouernment very wiſe, in life of great ſinceritie, &amp; in bloud much eſtéemed: for that he was deſcended by the right line of king Aeneas ſonne vnto Anchiſes, and ſonne in lawe vnto king Priamus,
                  
and father to Aſchanius. When Glabrion perceiued Pertinax to perſiſt with ſo great inſtance to inueſt him with the Empire, he ſaid vnto him in the preſence of the whole Senate: the humble humilitie which thou ſheweſt Pertinax in the want of merit of the Empire, the ſame maketh thée of deſeruing ſufficient of the Empire, vnto which election all wée of the Senate do conſent: not moued thereunto by the election of the armie, but to ſée thée make ſo ſmal accompt of thy ſelfe: in ſuch wiſe, that this thy refuſal yeldeth thy merit ſufficient. A great while was the whole Senat perſuading Pertinax to condeſcend to their requeſt, which is to wit, to accept the Empire: but his repugnance was ſo great, that in a manner by force they placed him in the chayre: and that which is more, the whole Senate perceiued, that he did nothing feynedly: for it was lamentable to heare the lamentation which hee made, and to ſée the abundance of teares which he ſhed. But afterwards, when hée was placed in the imperial chaire, Pertinax ſpake vnto the Senate after this maner.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           His Oration to the Senate.
                           THAT which I will now ſpeake vnto you (fathers conſcript) the God Iupiter, in whoſe houſe now we ſtand, be my witnes, I wil not therin deceiue you: for this place being conſecrate vnto the gods (as it is) it ſhould be great ſacrilege, for men to aduenture to lye therein. For all weakneſſe which men commit, they may haue excuſe, except it be for lying: becauſe vnto other vices, humane weakenes doth inuite or intice vs: but to lye, we are not moued but with our owne proper malice. Fathers conſcript, ye ſee how Commodus your Emperour is dead, and the deſtinies haue brought to paſſe that I ſucceede him in the Empire: perchance, for as much as he did wiſhe mee euill, and

his workes of my part not very well liked, it may be thought of you, that the manner of his death was firſt notified vnto mee, and his life cut off by my deuice: wherein throughly to ſatiſfie you, I ſweare and proteſt by the immortall gods, that of this fault I am not guiltie: becauſe I was ſo innocent thereof, that when they ſaid that Commodus was dead, at that inſtant I thought he had ſent to haue ſlaine mee. Notwithſtanding, that both he and we ſhal all die, I would not that ſo ſtraunge a death ſhould haue finiſhed his dayes: not becauſe Commodus did not deſerue the ſame, but for the great bond which our mother Rome doth owe vnto his father Marcus Aurelius: for it many times happeneth, that the errours of the children, be recompenced with the merittes of their fathers. I was ſeruant and aduaunced of the good Marcus Aurelius, which is the greateſt weale that the deſtinies might haue giuen me in this world, &amp; I ſay it is to this end, becauſe it ſhould be great griefe vnto me, if in my preſence any thing ſhould be ſaid, either in my abſence any thing ſhould be done, againſt his ſonne Commodus, although he be now dead: for that in my heart, I finde my ſelfe much more bound to acknowledge the great goodnes which I receiued of my Lord Marcus Aurelius: then to reueng the iniuries that I ſuffered of his ſonne Commodus. Beleue mee (fathers cōſcript) that if ye ſhall do cōtrary vnto this which I haue ſaid, it may be, that obſeruing time wherin I ſhall find my ſelfe, it ſhalbe neceſſarie to diſſemble it, but I may not ceaſe greatly to feele it. The prouidence of the gods is farre different from the deuices of men, &amp; that which moueth me to this ſpeach, is, that when I was a yong man, I much deſired the Empire, and might not atteine

it: and now that I am old and do abhorre it, they force mee to take it: in ſuch wiſe, they giue vs that which we hate, and denie vs that which we ſeeke or craue. When I began to hold offices in the common wealth, I thought it moſt certeine, that it was no humaine matter, but a diuine dignitie, to be a Romane Emperour: but after I taſted of the trauells of commaundements, and of authoritie, and vnderſtoode the peril to reigne: I did clearely ſee that amongeſt all the trauels of men, to be an Emperour is the greateſt.
                           Neither merueile, either be eſcādalized (O ye fathers conſcript, to ſee me ſo vntractable, and with ſo many teares to refuſe the Empire: for if I thought to vſe my ſelfe therein as a tyrant, I would not caſte it off, but would rather procure the ſame: but as my meaning is to liue &amp; gouerne more to the profite of the common wealth, thē to the aduancement of mine owne houſe: reſpecting my ſmall ſtrength, the Empire is to mee, a great burthen. Being, as I was, moſt truly ſatiſfied with the acquaintance and conuerſation of the trauels of the Empire, there were no reaſon to think, I ſhould deſire the Empire: becauſe there is none ſo fooliſh, as the man, that with the hope of a remedie, would offer himſelfe vnto an hazard. Vnto this day I haue beene eſteemed in poſſeſſion of great wealth, but now that I am an Emperour, I am forced to become poore: for yt a prince, in reſpect of ſuch, with whō he hath to deale and accompliſh, hath fewe thinges to giue, and hath a thouſand neceſſities that conſtreine him to bribe and robbe. Vntil this day I haue had ſome quietneſſe, but from henceforth I ſhalbe conſtreined to liue diſcontented: becauſe from the trauel and diſquietnes of the prince, peace and quietneſſe doeth proceede vnto the common

wealth. The office of the prince is not to ſleepe, but to watche: not to be idle, but to trauell: for that euerie exceſſiue recreation, which his perſon taketh, forthwith redoundeth to the offence of the common wealth. From my birth vntill this day, of any thing I haue not had greater experiēce, then to ſee, heare, read, ſuffer, and experiment trauels: wherof many I beheld farre off: but alas of my ſelfe, that nowe am inuironed therewith: becauſe the appetite of the vulgar people is ſo feeble and variable, that if to day they giue and elect a good prince, to morrow they would reliſhe and haue a taſte of the gouernement of ſome other. Naturallie, all men, in all thinges, and at all houres, deſire to heare and ſee nouelties, and much more deſire the ſame in the eſtate of gouernement, then in all other thinges: for that no prince gouerneth ſo well, but that they conceiue an other ſhould gouerne better. Vntill this day I haue beene well liked, ſerued, and reuerenced, but from henceforth al men for the moſt part, ſhal beare me enuie and hatred: becauſe the eſtate of princes is ſo enuied, that hee ſhall want ſand in the Sea to reckon his enimies: but the number of his fingers of one hand, ſhal exceede to point out his friends.
                           All this I haue ſaid (fathers conſcript) to the end ye ſhall not merueile, why I haue refuſed the burthen of the Empire, but rather am eſcandalized, knowing what I know, to ſee my ſelfe charged and ouer laden with ye Empire: becauſe to renounce it, a thouſād thinges do moue me, &amp; to attempt it, nothing inuite me. But ſince the gods haue ſo willed, my deſtinies ſo permitted, &amp; ye alſo haue ſo ordeined: I determin to lode my ſelfe with this burdē, although I am aſſured it wil coſt me my life: but I yeld it al for wel imployed, if it

perfourmed to the benefite of the common wealth.
                        
                     
                  
               
               Theſe woordes being ſaid by Pertinax, the Senate receiued great pleaſure, and chiefly praiſed him, for that hée forbad all men to ſpeake euill of Commodus, knowing (as they all did knowe) that hée had béene his mortall enimie. The Senat receiued Pertinax in the midſt amōgeſt them, and did accompany and attend vpon him, vnto all the temples: and euery temple did offer vnto the Gods, notable
ſacrifices. And moſt truly this was a notable and alſo a laudable cuſtome amongeſt the Romans, which is to witt, that princes newly elected, did firſt viſite the Gods, before they permitted themſelues to be viſited of men. As Pertinax had his perſon in ſo great authoritie, and being elected by the armie, and the Senat with ſo great concord: and further, being old and hoarie headed, and ſo long time knowen in Rome, it was a monſtruous thing to behold, when he came forth into Rome, how al men haſted to ſée his face: for truly it ſeemed litle vnto euery man to obey him as a prince, but to loue and ſerue him as a father.
               
            
            
               CHAP. VI. ¶ Of many thinges which he did after he was Emperour.
               THe firſt thing that Pertinax commaunded, or prouided, was, that the men of warre were very wel payed: and therwith practiſed great diſcipline, in which matter, more then in any other, he preſently gaue reformation: for that in the Empire of Commodus, the armie was abandoned vnto great libertie.
               
                  Cōmodus conſumed ſo great ſummes of monie in vices, yt there was not ſufficient to pay the men of warre: &amp; by this occaſion they did filche by night, rob on high wayes, ſacke houſes, ſpoile corne, oppreſſe the poore, and were bribers with rich men: finally, they were deſperate, and ſo fleſht,

that for feare of any paine, they neuer abſteyned from offence. Not many dayes after that Pertinax was publiſhed Emperour, and with great ſeriouſnes on a certeine day, vſed familiaritie with Letus and Electus, a Conſul named Falcus ſaid vnto him: what an Emperour (O Pertinax) thou ſhalt proue, thy workes begin to make demonſtration: ſince thou leadeſt after thee Letus and Electus, which as traytours did kill their Lord Commodus: doing what thou doeſt, and conſenting to that wherto thou didſt conſent, it may be no leſſe, beſides the euill example which thou yéeldeſt vnto Rome, thou giueſt alſo ſuch ſcruple vnto thy fame: whereby we thinke, that if thou wert not the inuentour of his death, at the leaſt thou delighteſt to cloke the ſame. Vnto this Pertinax made aunſwere, it well ſéemeth, that although thou be a Cōſul, thou art but a yongling: ſince thou knoweſt not to make difference of times. It maketh no great matter, that I doe with Letus and Electus, as they did with their Lord Commodus, that is to ſay, they obeyed him and followed him, and that whiche they moſt deſired, they moſt diſſembled: and at the houre of opportunitie, they diſpatched him of his life. The ſame day that hée was created Auguſtus and Emperour, hée was intituled Pater patriae: this excellencie vnto none, either ſince or before, was giuen vppon that day. His wife was named Flauia Titiana, vnto whome likewiſe on the ſame day that he was inueſted Auguſtus, ſhe was intituled Auguſta. The Emperour Pertinax did greatly trauell, to allowe all thinges that his Lord Marcus Aurelius did fauour, to finiſh that which hée had begon, to ſuſteine that which hée had left, to repaire that which he had built and to imitate all that which hée had done: for hée ſaid, it was impoſſible to erre, in following the ſtepps of the good Marcus Aurelius. The fame being diuulgate thoroughout the Empire, howe Commodus was dead, and Pertinax choſen Emperour: the countries, cities, prouinces, and kingdomes, gaue very large rewards vnto the meſſengers thereof, no leſſe for the death of Commodus, then for the

election of Pertinax. As hée had béene in ſo long time in ſo many prouinces, Pretor, Cenſor, Quirite, Edil, Conſul, Proconſul, and Cenſor, Pertinax was one of the moſt famous Romanes in the Empire: whereof ſuccéeded, that after the Barbarians were aduertiſed, that Pertinax was Emperour of Rome, ſuch as were rebelles, left their armour, and ſuch as had taken truce, made peace. Pertinax had a ſonne, whome the Romanes would haue created Auguſtus, to the end hée ſhould ſuccéede him after his dayes in the Empire: which he could neuer like off, or conſent vnto, ſaying: The Gods neuer graunt, that with the hope of the Empire, my ſonne ſhould be nouriſhed vnto vice and idleneſſe. Commodus had laide intollerable impoſtes and tributes vpon his people, which Pertinax commaunded to be made fruſtrate: affirming, that of the will of princes in charging their kingdomes with vniuſt tributes, there ſuccedeth a wilful denial of due and moſt iuſt paiments. 
                  Falſe witneſſes hee commaunded to be puniſhed
according vnto the lawe named, Pena del talion, that is to ſay, they ſhould be executed by Iuſtice, wherein they had accuſed others by malice. Hée ordeyned that the teſtament which had béen made by the huſband &amp; wiſe ioyntly, might not be altered by the ſuruiuer. Alſo he did ordeyne, that any man dying inteſtate, ſhould not forfett his landes or goods vnto ye fiſcall, but that his ſonne, or moſt néere kinſman ſhould inherite the ſame: ſaying, there were no reaſon or iuſt lawe, where the dead for want of ſpeach ſhould looſe his goods. The Senators on a day ſaid vnto Pertinax, how the Queſtors of the treaſurie, and the officers of the fiſcal, had murmured at him, for the law that he made in the fauour for the dead inteſtate, vnto whom hee aunſweared: Fathers conſcript, I may ſafely ſay, there are not ſo many that complaine of this lawe, as there be that praiſe and alowe it: but I recke not whether the one doth praiſe or the other miſlike: but in my iudgement, it is no worke of Romanes, but the inuētion of tyrants, of robberies, briberies &amp; rapines, to fill the treaſurie with riches.
He made a lawe,

that no fiſcall ſhould ſue anye perſon for landes, or goodes that were doubtfull, ſaying: that the fiſcall ought to remoue nothing that clearely were not his owne: and that in caſe of doubt, more ſure and more conformable vnto iuſtice were it, to remaine with him that doth poſſeſſe it, thā with the fiſcall that doth demaunde it. He commaunded all things vniuſtly taken by his predeceſſour Commodus, to be reſtoared vnto the owners. When the Secretarie came to firme this lawe to be proclaimed, and Pertinax reading the ſame, wherein it was ſaid: Wee commaunde that all thinges which our predeceſſour Commodus hath robbed, which word robbed, he blotted out with his pen, and enterlined this woord gotten: ſaying, it is ſufficient that the lawe be in the fauour of the liuing: without iniuring, with foule woordes, Princes that be dead. All that which was knowen manifeſtly to be Commodus debt, he commaunded to be payed, and all which he had promiſed to be giuen: and beſides all this, the wheat, oyle, and other things which particularly were vſed to be giuen and diuided amongeſt the people of Rome, he cauſed with great diligence to be brought from all kingdomes, and in great abundance and liberalitie commaunded it to be beſtowed. Many vniuſt tributs being takē away by Pertinax, there ſuccéeded a great neceſſitie for the paiment and reliefe of the armie of Africa: whereby he was conſtreyned to exact new impoſitions of his common wealth, whereuppon the Conſul Gelianus toke occaſion to ſay, that he had done contrary to that which he had begon in the Empire, &amp; againſt that which he had ſaid in the Senat: Pertinax aunſwering ſaid. When I was Conſul (as thou art) I did meruaile at the déedes of princes, and now that I am an Emperour, I meruaile of that which you Conſuls do ſpeake: thus much Gelianus I ſay to this end, becauſe thou ſhalt vnderſtand, that Emperours at times, make lawes as they ought, and at other times not as they would, but as they may.
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. VII. ¶ Of many thinges which he did ordeine and reforme in the common wealth.
               THere was in Rome and in the confines of Italie, much roughe ground for corne, which being barren for want of manuring, Pertinax commaunded proclamation to bée made, that if any man would grub, manure, or till ye ſame, hée ſhould fréely for tenne yeares, take the profite thereof. Before Pertinax vſed this diligence in Italie, frō 
                  Aegypt, Spaine, and Sicyl, they brought wheat to furniſh the ſame: for which cauſe Traiane did vſe to ſay, that Rome was more tributarie then any place of the world: for that they could not eate, but if it were giuen them from other kingdomes. There were many particular thinges ſaid to be
the Emperours, namely, hills, heards, gardēs, riuers, palaces, and houſes: which hée commaunded to be altered, naming them hils, gardens and riuers, not of the Emperour, but of the common wealth, for hée affirmed, that on that day, in which any whatſoeuer, was made Emperour, hée might haue nothing proper vnto himſelfe: and ſaid further, that if this name Prince be well vnderſtoode, it giueth no other dignitie to the perſon that vſeth the ſame, but to make him defender of the territories of the countrie, and procurer of the common wealthe. In the dayes of his predeceſſours, they had attempted new impoſitions, that is to ſay, in ports of the ſea, at the ports of cities, for paſſage of high wayes, of barkes vppon riuers, and for baking in ouens: al which were to the great detriment of the common wealth, and the auncient libertie of Rome: the collection whereof Pertinax from thence forth, commaunded to ceaſſe.
Being demaunded of the Conſul Tortelius, why he made fruſtrat lawes ſo profitable, aunſweared: becauſe without compariſon much more are the diſpleaſures which they giue me,

then the money which they bring me: and as mée ſéemeth, we may not ſaye, that that money is verie cleanely that comes imbrewed with diſpleaſures. He commaunded that in criminall cauſes, offendours ſhould be verie well hearde: and if in caſe any ſhould dye, fourtie dayes to be expired before he ſhould ſuffer. It was a matter verye monſtruous and ſcandalous, that was conſumed in expences, in the dayes of Commodus: wherein Pertinax in ſuche wiſe prouided, that they murmured no leſſe againſt him for his frugalitie, then againſt Commodus for his prodigalitie.
They muche blame Pertinax, who ſet before his gueſtes whiche did eate at his table, halfe pigges, and halfe géeſe: and many times ſent two ſoppes betwixt two plates for a preſent, and ſometime the legge of a Pheſant, &amp; at other times the wing of a capon, and reſerued alſo in the morning ſomewhat to be eaten at night. Princes ought verie muche to conſider, and alſo to auoyde, not to be noted miſerable at their table: for it is verie ſmall that in ſuch trifles may be ſaued, and verie much that they giue vnto the multitude to murmur.
                  
He many times came foorth vnto the fielde of Mars, and there he cauſed the whole armie to exerciſe feates of war, rewarding ſuch as were induſtrious, and reprehendinge ſuch as were dull and harteleſſe. There were many Romaines, and others in the confines of Italie, whiche did owe great ſummes of money, not onely vnto the fiſcall, but alſo vnto the treaſurie, among whome, ſome in times paſt had béene his friendes, and others that were in great neceſſitie, he cōmaunded both the one &amp; the other to bee deliuered of the fiſcall, ſince it was due vnto him ſelfe, and made payement of their whole debt that was due vnto the treaſurie.
Amongeſt other vertues, the Emperour Pertinax of twaine was muche noted and praiſed: whiche is to wéete, of clemencie and gratefulneſſe: for that he was pitifull vnto the afflicted, and thankfull vnto his friendes. Pertinax had a ſonne, whome, after he was Emperour, he would not permit to come to the court, either as much

as vnto Rome: but that he helde him in his countrey, following his owne affaires, and the profite of his owne houſe: whereuppon the Conſul Fuluius Turbone ſaide vnto Pertinax, that he ſéemed rather the ſonne of a labourer, then of an Emperour: he lift vp his eyes to heauen and with a greate ſigh, ſaide: My mother Rome hath cauſe to be contented, that I offer and put my life in perill for her cauſe, without venturing my ſonne and houſe in like daunger. Moſt ſurely the ſaying was lamentable, and the more it is conſidered, the more profounde it is: whereby it appeareth, that he helde him ſelf for moſte vnfortunate, to be eſtabliſhed in the Empire: and that he left his ſonne in greateſt felicitie, to be depriued of the Empire.
               
               Although Pertinax were olde and graue, and was placed in the height of the Empire, he alwayes vſed greate vrbanitie towardes all men, in ſuche wiſe that no man did him reuerence, vnto whome he did not vtter ſome courteſie: according to the qualitie of the perſon.
Fiftie ſeruauntes in Rome in one night and in one houre, ſlewe their maiſters, for whome the Emperour cauſed ſo diligent ſearche, that onely fiue eſcaped: and the paine that he commaunded they ſhould ſuffer, was, to carrie the dead bodies bounde faſt backe to backe, in ſuche wiſe, that the ſtenche of the dead, did finiſhe the wretched life of the liuing.
               
               In the ſchoole where Pertinax ſtudied, a certeine Romaine named Valerius was there alſo a ſtudent, and being alwayes in companie, and of age not much vnlike, and continuing in greate friendſhip, did many times eate with Pertinax, which during their repaſt were neuer hearde to talke, but of ſcience, knighthood, repayring of Rome, or elſe the reformation of the common wealth.
               It did well appeare in Pertinax, that he tooke the Empire againſt his will: for truely, neither in his dyet, either in his apparell, either in his geſture or ſpéeche, either

in any other thing, did he behaue him ſelfe as an Emperour, in ſuche wiſe, that he preſumed not to repreſent what he was, but what he had béene, He ſaide manie times, that in this worlde he neuer made the like faulte, as when he accepted the Empire: and many times made motion to leaue the ſame, and to returne vnto his houſe: but that he did recomfort him ſelfe with this ſaying: that for as muche as he was of ſo greate age, he might not liue longe, but be deliuered of his tedious life.
            
            
               CHAP. VIII. ¶Of certeine vices wherewith he was infected, and of the prodigies of his death.
               AS the Emperour Pertinax was olde, ſo was he charged with the infirmities of olde age: that is to ſaye, with auarice, becauſe in gathering and kéeping of money he was verie diligent: and in giuing or ſpending verie dull and vnwilling.
               Alſo he was noted to be a man verie flexible in his affaires: that is to ſaye, he was not ſtiffe, either greatly did vſe therein any contradiction, but that which one did counſell him, another might eaſily perſuade the contrarye: the cauſe whereof was his good naturall inclination, whiche coulde not without griefe, beholde any man that was in ſorrowe.
               
                  Alſo Pertinax was noted, that he neuer denied any thing that was demaunded, although many his promiſes were neuer perfourmed: for, at moſte times he promiſed to giue that which was impoſſible to be accompliſhed. And becauſe the maieſtie and greateneſſe of Princes doth conſiſt to haue and poſſeſſe, whereof to giue: they ought much to be aduertiſed in conſideration, what is craued of them, and what they promiſe: for hauing to do (as they haue) with ſo manie, and to furniſhe ſo infinite neceſsities: they ought, if their ſubiectes be vnſhamefaſt in crauing, to be graue in promiſing. Ioyntly with this, Princes ought to be aduertiſed, that where they haue once gaged their royall worde, all things ſet aparte, they ought to perfourme the ſame. Pertinax was twiſe married, his ſeconde marriage was with the daughter of Vulpitianus, whome he made prefecte when he was made Emperour. As concerning the vnchaſtitie of his wife, alſo Pertinax was noted: whiche is to wéete, of negligence in gouerning, and remiſſe in reprehending her, for that truely ſhée was both young and faire, abſolute and diſſolute: and reported in Rome, to be more enamoured with a young Muſician then with Pertinax her olde huſbande. Alſo Pertinax was much noted to haue vſed vnlawfull loue with Cornificia his néere kinſwoman, whome he had nouriſhed from her childhood: for ſhée was committed by her father vnto his protection: this matter was no leſſe ſcandalous then foule and no leſſe foule, then ſcandalous: for that ſuche like, and ſo great euill, was not conuenient to a man of ſo greate age, either permiſſible in a Prince of ſo great grauitie. Some prodigious and ſtraunge ſignes
appeared before his death, eſpecially on a time, offering certeine ſacrafices vnto the Goddes Penates, that when the coales were moſte kindled and on fire, ſoudeinly they were ſéene all dead and quenched: whiche did ſignifie, that in the greateſt certeintie of his life, ſoudeinly death ſhould aſſaile him.
               
               
                  Not ſixe dayes before he was ſlaine, as in the temple

of Iupiter he was offering great ſacrifices, with his own handes he offered a Pecocke, wherein he found no hearte when it was opened, and ſoudeinely the head vaniſhed, when the throate was cutt. Eight dayes before he was ſlaine, a Starre ioyned with the Sunne, and did ſhine at noone dayes, as if it had béene midnight. Thrée dayes before he was ſlaine, Pertinax dreamed that he fell into a fiſhepond: and that there was a man with an huge knife to kill him, and woulde haue fled and could not. Iulianus whiche after ſuccéeded Pertinax in the Empire, hauing a Nephewe newe married vnto his Néece, and hauing repaired vnto Pertinax to viſite him, Pertinax ſaide vnto the young married man: be good, and I ſhall holde and eſteeme thee as my ſonne: ſerue thy vncle Iulianus as a father, becauſe he is my fellowe in office and ſucceſſour.
                  
They had béene ioyntly Conſuls, and afterwardes Iulianus in the proconſulſhip was ſucceſſour vnto Pertinax: and although he ſpake it of the ſucceſſion of the proconſulſhip, yet they conceiued his ſpéeche to be a prognoſtication of his ſucceſſion in the Empire. It was diſcouered vnto Pertinax, that the Conſul Falconius deſired and alſo procured to ſuccéede him in the Empire, and to that ende had taken a deuiſe to diſpatche him of his life, of whiche caſe Pertinax grieuouſly complained vnto the Senate: the trueth whereof being afterwardes tryed and knowen, he as inſtantly intreated that Falconius might be pardoned: ſaying, he had rather extoll him ſelfe by his clemencie, then boaſte him ſelfe of his vengeance: whereupon Falconius was pardoned, leading his life euer after in his houſe: and for that he had béene in greate honour, and amongeſt the Romaines muche eſtéemed, but by that treaſon had loſt his credite, within fewe dayes, méere ſorrowe gaue an ende vnto his life.
            
            
               
               CHAP. IX. Of the occaſion that the Pretorians tooke to murther him.
               THE officers that Commodus vſed for his ſeruice in court, as Chamberlaines, Secretaries, maiſters of houſholde, clarkes of the kitchin, porters, cookes, and ſuch other, Pertinax had not chaunged, ſtaying that chaunge vntil the daye of celebration of the buylding of Rome: for he helde opinion, that before the euil ſhoulde be remoued, it were greate reaſon, at leaſure to make election of others that were good. That which Pertinax had thought to haue done in his houſe, he determined alſo to execute amongeſt the captaines of warres, and other officers of the common wealth, becauſe they were ſo abſolute in commaunding, and ſo couetous in robbing, that if the paine were recompenced with the fault, it had béene a ſmall matter, from euery one of them to haue taken away life.
               When affaires of importaunce are deferred, the ſecreat thereof incurreth greate daunger: and for this cauſe, as Pertinax deferred this matter from day to day, all officers ſuſpected what he woulde do with them, and therfore determined to diſpatche him of his life. Extremely was Pertinax hated of the men of warre, and of the particular officers of the common wealth: which hatred procéeded not of any iuſt offence, done by this good Prince, but for that he conſented not that they ſhould robbe &amp; cō
                  mitte vile déedes. Many times the wicked beare enuie vnto the good, not becauſe the vertuous ſuffer them to do well, but for that they conſent not vnto them to do euill: for ſo peruerſe is the malice of ſome peruerſe perſons, that they take more delight to do euil vnto others,

then to receiue benefite vnto them ſelues.
               
               Vnto all the officers of the common wealth, Pertinax commaunded that they ſhoulde enioye intierly all fées and profites appertaining vnto their offices: and vnto all the Pretors, and ſouldiers of the warres, he prouided their wages very well paide them: and beſides all this he dealte not with them as with vaſſals, but the chiefteines he did honour as brethren, and to meaner perſones he ſpake as vnto his ſonnes: but all this notwithſtanding, they liued in greate paſſion, and no leſſe diſcontented: for that in times paſt, their extraordinarie robberies were muche more then their wages. But thus was the caſe.
               
                  On a daye, certeine Pretors of the armies did aſſemble at a dinner, with other officers of the citie, as alſo diuers ſeruitours of the courte: and after they had largely eaten, and aboundantly drunken, they beganne to talke of the dayes of Commodus: that is to ſaye, howe then they were at libertie, riche, and honoured: and now ſince Pertinax reigned, they were poore, captiues, and defaced: and that the faulte thereof conſiſted more in their owne cowardiſe, then in any other perſon. And further procéeding in this matter, they concluded to ſpoile Pertinax of his life, and to chooſe another Emperour of Rome at their liking, which ſhoulde renewe the memorie of their Lorde Commodus, and violate all actes that Pertinax had confirmed: and that it was a more ſafer waye to bee gouerned by a wiſe young man like Commodus, then by an olde dotyng foole, as Pertinax.
                  
               
               
                  Partely, for that they had their heades troubled with drinke, and their ſtomaches hoate with eating, but aboue all the reſt, furiouſly inflamed with talke, ſoudeinly they roſe all from the boorde, and euery man goeth home to be armed, with a determination to dye in that enterpriſe: or, that ſame daye to diſpatche Pertinax of his life.
               
               
                  
                  All the people being at quiet, and Pertinax recheleſſe and without regarde, the pretorians of the armies, with a greate number of armed men, ſome trayling their lances, and others with ſwordes drawen, marche vnto the imperiall palace, where Pertinax was repoſing: for that it was but little more then paſt noone. And as they approched the houſe, they began to exclaime: the memorie of Commodus liue for euer, and the falſe olde Pertinax is but dead. All ſuch as were preſent with Pertinax in the palace, neither knewe what to doe, and muche leſſe what to counſell: ſome ſaide vnto Pertinax that he ſhould ſende for ſuccour vnto the people: others, that he ſhoulde hide him ſelfe in ſome ſecrete place: others, that he ſhuld fight vntil his friendes ſhoulde ſende reliefe: finally, the caſe conteined ſo great confuſion, that he whiche feared leaſt, did feare to loſe his life: becauſe all thoſe deintie courtiers had exceſſe of garments to walke in the ſtréetes, but wanted armour to come foorth to fight. It ſéemed vnto Pertinax that to demaund ſuccour, there was no time: and to attempt to fight, they were too fewe: to put them ſelues to flight, there was no place: to traueile to be hidden, were a great blemiſhe: the good prince determined to come foorth &amp; to talke with the Pretorians, to ſée if with wordes he might apeaſe them. And as afterwardes they reported which were preſent with him 
                        〈◊〉
                      that great conflict, Pertinax did wel diſcouer the greatneſſe of his mind, and howe little he eſtéemed the Empire, and alſo, howe muche he lothed the vanities of this worlde, becauſe hee neither ſhewed any apparance of feare, for that he heard, either chaunge of countenaunce, either was troubled in any thing that he had to ſaye. Pertinax cauſed the gates of his court to be ſet wide open, and came foorth of his chamber, hauing no manner of armour or weapon, and began to reaſon with them that did inuiron him after this manner.
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. X. Of a notable ſpeach that the Emperour Pertinax vſed, when his ſouldiours came to kill him.
               IF this ſo greate commotion, whiche this day ye haue raiſed (O my friendes and commilitants) be for that I ſeeme not woorthy of the Empire of Rome: ye haue to remember, that I neither obtained the ſame by ſuite or requeſt, either bought it for money, but that forceably ye made me to take it, I of my parte imploying my forces to reſiſt it. And if it be, for that I haue had no regard vnto the common wealth, yee knowe howe ofte I haue requeſted to ceaſe from gouernement, and to departe vnto my houſe: and ſince this is moſte true, I knowe not to what end ye ſhoulde remoue me perforce from that whiche I woulde haue lefte and remitted with greate good will. And if for that I haue beene ingrate vnto my mother Rome, or haue vſed euill gouernement in the common wealth, ye will take away my life, then I cannot but confeſſe it to be a worke moſt iuſt, albeit thereby I ſhoulde be purſued, not onely with paine and griefe, but alſo with infamie: becauſe ſuche a death yealdeth more paine and ſhame to deſerue it, then to ſuffer it. And if ye thinke your ſelues diſgraced, to haue a Prince that is not deſcended of the Fabians, of the Metells, of the Fabritians, or

of ſome other notable Romanes: in this caſe impute the fault vnto the Gods, whiche ſo haue created me, and vnto your ſelues who with ſuch conditions woulde electe me Emperour: becauſe in naturall matters neither deſerue we prayſe, for yt we haue, either reprehenſion, for that whiche wee lacke. It were more iuſt (O my friendes and commilitants) in this caſe to haue reſpecte, not to the ſhadowe and vanitie of linage, but vnto the vertue &amp; grauitie of the perſō: for it ſtretcheth vnto ſmall purpoſe in good gouernemente, to be deſcended of generous bloude, and to bee of filthy life. And if ye haue been altered, for wante of pay of wages, for the whole or in parte, preſently giue me to vnderſtande, and I ſweare and promiſe, that preſently euerie man ſhall entirelie be paide: whiche if it be ſo, I am vtterly without faulte: ſince vntill this preſent I neuer hearde thereof. And ſeeing ye be gentlemen of greate power, and Romanes of noble bloud, ye haue to conſider in this caſe, that according vnto our lawes, innocencie and ignorance of the fault mitigateth &amp; diminiſheth the extremitie of puniſhmēt. And if in caſe ye be eſcā
                  dalized for yt ye ſee mee rigorous, hard, &amp; extreme, &amp; yt I am ſo reputed amongſt the people: as ſmall reaſon haue ye in this caſe, as in the reſt, becauſe vniuerſaly they craue that iuſtice be done, and yet they abhorre ye execution thereof. And if ye would blame me for the death of Commodus my predeceſſour, and your Lorde: ye haue ſeene by experience howe muche I am blameleſſe, and that vnto mee, more then to anie man, his death was grienous: and that this is true, call to your remembrance

the day on which Commodus was ſlaine: where in I ſawe you ſinge for ioy: and of greate griefe ye ſawe me to weepe. You Romaines, you may not denie mee, but that the death of Commodus was of you all deſired, and my election of you all alowed: and ſince it was ſo, I maruell that men of ſo greate authoritie and grauitie, ſhould inuente ſo ſtraunge a noueltie as this that is to ſay, in ſo ſhorte ſpace, to hate that whiche ye procured: and to haue an appetite to that which ye loathed. I ſweare by the immortall Gods, I knowe not of anie vile deede which I haue don againſt the common wealthe, wherefore ye ſhould abhorre mee: neither knowe I anie thinge that Commodus hath done ſince hee died, wherefore ye ſhoulde loue and deſire him: for if we ſighe for the dead, it is not for their deedes done, after that they died: but for the good woorkes whiche they perfourmed when they were liuinge. If for no other cauſe then to take away my life, ye haue ioyned and armed all theſe men of warre: certeinlie it is a thinge ſuperfluous and vaine, in as much as I am both ſicke &amp; olde, and with the burthen of the Empire ſo muche diſcontented, and with my life ſo muche diſpleaſed, I eſteeme little to liue, and much leſſe to die.
               It grieueth me not ſo muche to loſe my life, as it doth of the ſlaunder and infamie whiche ye lay vpon our mother Rome: whiche is to ſay, that the Romans which haue bene renowned for their loyaltie towardes their princes, ſhoulde haue reporte throughout the worlde, to haue ſlaine their Emperour.
               
                  Ye knowe that ye beeing (as ye are) men of warre, and to no other ende ſo well payed and relieued of ye tribute, but to chaſtice ſuche as rebell in the common wealth, and to defende the houſe and the imperiall perſone of your prince: and ſince it is thus, what may be more vnſeemlie, impertinent, and ſcandalous, then ſuche as be admitted for my guarde and ſafetie, that they and no other ſhould come to take away my life. And for as muche as ye be men of warre, ye are bounde to obſerue the lawes there of: that is to ſay, euen in the warrs of enimies, yee may not, or ought not to kill children or olde men: and ſince I am an olde man, and a citizen of Rome, wherefore will yee do with mee, that which yee will not do with an enimie? In theſe wordes whiche ye haue ſaide, in the diſorder whiche ye haue vſed, and in the houre wherin ye haue vndertaken this matter, it clearely appeareth that to enterpriſe ſo greate a matter, ye haue not vſed greate prouidence: for if ye had conſidered and examined the matter, ye ſhoulde moſte certainlie haue founde, that in your determination to kill mee, there is no other fruite gathered, but to raiſe in your mother Rome a greate ſcandal, and to thruſte your ſelues in great daunger. And ſince one ſhall inherite the Empire, and not all: with what folly are you taken (ye Romaines) for ye al to hazarde and loſe your ſelues for one mans gaine, and yet knowe not, if afterwardes that one man ſhall be gratefull or vnthankefull. I may not flee that whiche the deſtinies haue ordayned, either what ye haue determined: but in caſe

this be my laſt day, and my fatall houre be come: I pray the immortall Godes, that the innocent bloude whiche ſhal be ſhead of me, that the vengeance thereof fall not vpon my mother Rome: but that euerie one of you doe feele it in his perſon and his houſe.
               
                  
                     When Pertinax came to the pointe, to ſpeake theſe woordes, for the moſte parte al that were preſente let fall teares from their eyes, and beganne to departe, turning their backes, and holding downe their weapons: becauſe they had greate ſhame, to offende and to wante reuerence vnto ſo honourable horie haires, and to wordes ſo wel ſpoken. He that moſte vilelie had ſpoken againſt Pertinax, &amp; he that moſt had moued ye men of warre, was one named Tuncius of ye countrie of Theutonio: this wretched caytiue whē he ſawe that al men returned, and had renounced to kill Pertinax, he thruſt a lance, through the mideſt of his bodie: with whiche wounde, Pertinax fell to the earth, and therevpon gaue him other woundes wherof he preſentlie dyed. Greate ſorrowe was it vnto the people of Rome, when they vnderſtode that Pertinax was dead, and hauing reigned but fourtéene moneths &amp; xx. dayes, he profited more the commonwealth, thē others in fourtéene yeares. The traytour Tuncius was not cōtented to haue ſlaine Pertinax, but he alſo and his companions forgotte not to cute off his head, to fixe it on a lance, and to beare it through the ſtréets of Rome. Pertinax died the fifte daye of April Falconius &amp; Clarus being Conſuls, his head was throwne of his enimies into Tiber, his bodie burieed by his friends and kinſfolkes in the ſepulchre of his father in lawe, at that preſent without anie funerall pomp, becauſe they ſlewe all perſons that vttered ſorrowe or griefe for his death.
                  
               
            
         
         
            
            
               The life of the Emperour Iulianus, that bought the Empire, compiled by ſyr Anthonie of Gueuara, Biſhop of Mondonnedo, preacher, chronicler, &amp; counſeller vnto the Emperour Charles the fifte.
            
               CHAP. I. Of the life, linage, and countrie of the Emperour Iulianus.
               
                  THe Emperour Didiꝰ Iulianꝰ, had to his great graundfather a Romaine named Salianus, who was a learned lawyer, twiſe Conſul, Pretour of the citie, and died in the ſecōd yeare of the reigne and Empire of Nero: and they ſay, he died of pure ſorrowe, to ſée the common wealth in the handes of ſo furious a tyrant, as Nero.
               
               His graundfather was named Salbius Iulianus, who gaue him ſelfe more to armes, then to letters: and went vnto the warres of Datia with Traiane, and was captaine of the ſeconde Legion, and longe time diuider of the victualls, and in the ende dyed in his office, that is to ſay, in the warres againſt kinge Dacus. His father was named Didius Petronius, who neither gaue him ſelfe to ſcience, either folowed the warrs as his predeceſſours, but was reſidente and liued alwayes in Rome, folowing his affaires, and holdinge offices in the common wealth: hee was an

aſſured friende vnto Antoninus Pius, and dyed in the Empire of the good Marcus Aurelius. His mother was named Clara Emilia, a generous and noble Romaine, a greate friende and kinſwoman of Domitia Lucilla, that was mother vnto Marcus Aurelius: ſo did ſhe intreate and fauour him as a ſonne, and he did obey her as a mother. The firſt office that Didius Iulianus did beare in the common wealth, was Decemviriato, which is to wéete, to be one of the x. viſitours of ye people: and though he wanted age to vſe it, yet he wanted not fauour to obteine it, becauſe Domitia, mother vnto Marcus Aurelius, did craue this office for him in the Senate. He was alſo Queſtor two yeares together, which office he helde againſt the Romane lawes, for that he was vnder the age of xxx. yeares: but as hee obtained the office of Decemviriato by the ſute of the mother, ſo did they graunte the other, by the fauour of the ſonne, which is to wéete Marcus Aurelius. And after that Didius Iulianus was paſt the age of thirtie yeares, he neuer wanted offices in the common wealth: for vntill that age, ye 
                  Romanes had rather that yongemen ſhoulde occupie them ſelues in learning, then in commaunding and gouernement.
               
                  Iulianus was Edil, Pretor, and Cenſor diuerſe times, diuers yeares, and at times muche diſtant: but the office wherein he continued longeſt time, was Romane Pretor: becauſe he had learning to gouerne, and iuſtice to execute. He was naturallie giuen to the warres, and with this motion he went one time into Germanie, where hee neither obtained fame, either augmented his goods: for that certeinely he was more handſome in gouernemente, then hardie in fight.
               He gouerned by the ſpace of three yeares, the prouince of Belgica, whiche nowe is named Swetia, in which gouernement, he behaued him ſelfe ſo venturouſlie, yt he obteined what he had loſt in the warre, which is to ſay, much reputation in the common wealth, and greate goodes for his houſe.
               
                  In the ſeconde yeare of the Empire of Marcus Aurelius, the inhabitantes neere vnto the riuer Albo (whiche is in the kingdome of Bohemia) rebelled, vnto which commotion Didius Iulianus repayred: and as hee was humble of ſpeache, ſkilful and aduiſed in his affaires, ſo in ſhort ſpace he reduced them vnto ye ſeruice of the Romaine Empire. When the Senate had intelligence what Iulianus had done in Bohemia, the Emperoure thoughte him ſelfe therein verie well ſerued, and the Senate no leſſe contented: chieflie, for that ſo exactlie hee had perfourmed the ſame, without requeſte or commaundemente: and in recompence of this ſo ſingular a ſeruice, they ſent him the Conſulſhippe, without his requeſte, or anie other to ſolicite the ſame. When the newes of Conſulſhipe came vnto Iulianus, they ſaye that he ſaide: I ſweare by the immortall Godes, that I neither ſolicited the Conſulſhip, either thought to haue obteined the ſame: but here in it clearelie appeareth, that the good dothe more ſolicite with his good woorkes, then the euill with his manie guiles.
               
               After he had accompliſhed the yeare of Conſulſhipe, hee was ſent vnto ye lower Germanie as Pretor, which countrie is nowe called Flanders, where he remained two years: &amp; frō thēce returned to Rome, where he had charge of victuals which office amongſt the Romaines was more profitable, then honourable. The Emperour Marcus Aurelius being deade, his ſonne Commodus reigning in the Empire, Iulianus was accuſed for a traitour, for that he, and Siluius his couſen, had conſpired to haue ſlaine Commodus: his accuſer was a noble gentleman of Rome named Seuerus: but for that he might not proue his accuſation, they cut off his heade, and ſet Iulianus at libertie. At one time Iulianus was in fauour with Commodus, &amp; an other time in diſgrace: but after that he was accuſed of conſpiracie, he did allwayes beare him mortall hatred: and when he vnderſtoode this in Commodus, both in worde and deede, moſte times he kéept his houſe and

excuſed him ſelfe from the offices of the common wealth.

                     Iulianus was a lawyer, and in letters moſte learned: of whome it is ſaid, that fewe did ſurpaſſe him in ſcience, and none was equall vnto him in eloquence: for hee did neuer pleade anie cauſe in the Senate, but he obteined the victorie. He was prompt in ſpeache, ſharpe in propounding, and graue in determination, of ſtature ſomewhat lowe, of ſanguine complexion, and in his youth beganne to be horeheaded: of whome in this caſe it may be ſaide, that hee was a monſter in nature: for that he had neuer a white haire in his bearde, either anie blacke haire in his heade. His wife was named Malia Eſcantilia, and had but one daughter named Didia Clara. In this alſo as in the other, nature woulde be extreme: becauſe the mother was the moſte foule woman that had bene ſeene in Rome, and the daughter was the faireſt dame, that euer was ſéene in Italie.
                  
               
               As Iulianus had gouerned manie countries, had the charge of victuales, &amp; was chiefeſt aduocate in lawe in al Rome, ſo he obteined the poſſeſſion of manie iuells, and the hoording vp of greate ſummes of money: for whiche cauſe, all the principall Romaines ſought to be his ſonnes in lawe: partelie to marrie with the daughter that was ſo faire, as alſo to inherite the goods that were ſo greate. Iulianus was ſlender, drie, and towards his later dayes he was growne to be cholerik aduſt, he neuer drank wine, and therefore did eate muche: and yet notwithſtanding, he was ſo curious and ſo coſtlie in his manner to drinke water, that with leſſe coſt he might haue druncke wine. Beinge nowe growne olde, and rich, and hauing but one daughter whiche alſo was married. Iulianus gaue him ſelfe to liue in ioy and pleaſure, that is to ſay, vſed not but to ſolace alongſt the riuers, to haunte places frequē
                  ted with people, to recreate with friends, to talke of times paſte, to ſéeke exquiſite and delicate meates, and alwayes to haue new gueſtes: in ſuch wiſe, that hee did flie eache thinge, that was diſpleaſante: and did and procured what

ſo euer might yealde pleaſure. Iulianus longe time perſeuered in Rome in this manner of life, according to which life, he had neither faithfull friendes, or feared and cruell enimies, becauſe if anie did loue him, it was for that hee gaue them ſome of his money: and if others did hate him, it was becauſe they receiued no parte of his riches.
            
            
               CHAP. II. Howe the Empire of Rome was ſet to ſale, and alſo ſoulde by proclamation.
               AT the inſtante that ye Pretorian bandes had ſlaine the Emperour Pertinax, they aduiſed to ioyne in one, to ſeaze the walles, to take the gates of Rome, and that with an armed power: partelie for that the people ſhould not riſe againſt them, as alſo to chooſe an Emperour at their owne liking. Although the common people behelde the imperiall palace beſette, yet they did not thinke that they woulde haue ſlaine the Emperour: becauſe the fame went amongſt them, that Pertinax was come foorth, and that with milde wordes he had intreated them: but as it after chaunced, though the greate troupes were retyred, Pertinax was ſlaine by the fewer number. Whē ye death of Pertinax was notified vnto the commō people, al Rome was readie in armour. Verie greate was the confuſion whiche was that day in Rome, both of the one parte, to ſee Pertinax ſlaine, and alſo for that ye armie was bent againſt the people, and euerie houre redie to ioyne &amp; kill eache other, but that they knewe not againſte whome to fight: becauſe the people woulde haue taken vengeaunce of the traitours that had ſlaine the Emperour, but the armie woulde not deliuer them: in ſuche wiſe, that they

were all faultie in that facte, the one in the acte, the other for conſent.
               The moſte principall of the Senate, manie matrones of Rome, moſte wealthy perſons, and ſuch as loued peace and quietneſſe, after that they ſawe the walles beſette, the towers taken, the gates lockt, and the ſtreetes ſtopte through out al Rome, they departed vnto their inheritances, vntill they might ſee the concluſion of that ſo perilous &amp; ſcandalous a tumulte: for they had had experience, that no man might be ſafe in his houſe, vntill there were a new Emperour: and that the election of him, ſhoulde be conſecrated with the handes of manie perſons. The Pretorian bandes beholding the moſte parte of the people to be fled, and none lefte that durſte reuenge the death of Pertinax, or reſiſte their attempts: they loſt al feare, and recouered a newe courage, not to amende the fault whiche they had committed, but to giue and ſell the Romane Empire. The caſe was thus, that a man at armes mounted vpon the wall at the gate Salaria, who in the name of the whole armie made proclamation, and ſaide with a loude voice: Is there anie man that will giue more for the Empire of Rome? is there anie man that will ſet a price? for vnto him that will giue moſt money, we will giue it for his owne. Of all the iniuries, diſgraces, and calamities, that the Frenchmen, the Asſyrians, the Hunnes, the Gothes &amp; the Lombards did vnto Rome, none was equal vnto this, which is to ſay, to ſet the greatneſſe and maieſtie of Rome in open ſale. It was greate griefe to ſée it, and alſo preſētlie to write it, to ſée and heare proclamation, who will giue money for the Empire of Rome: vnto whome a fore time the whole worlde had giuen tribute. By this ſo notable example, princes and mightie Potentates are to be admoniſhed, what greate mutabilitie is conteined in thinges of this worlde, ſince the ſame perſons, that had ſeene Rome the ladie of ſo manie and greate kingdomes, did alſo ſee her ſolde, proclamed, and bought for money.
               
               
                  Al the gentlemen, auncient Romanes, and Senatours, coulde not fill or ſatiſfie them ſelues with wéeping, when they behelde and hearde the proclamations made out at windowes: and that which did more grieue them, was the greate infamie whiche allwayes ſhoulde followe Rome, in that ſhée was ſet to ſale: and of the daunger alſo of the common wealth, which was to be bought of ſome tyrante. Thoſe that woulde haue bought the Empire, had no money, for that Commodus had ouerviewed and ranſackt their ſtore: and thoſe that coulde haue bought, of greate griefe and no leſſe ſhame, woulde not deale therein: for in reſpect of the iniurie that they ſhould haue committed vnto their mother Rome, it might not be ſaide, that they bought it for money, but ſolde it vnto ſome enimie. In concluſion the ſegniorie of Rome, and the greatneſſe and maieſtie of ye Empire, paſſed in publique proclamations, by the ſpace of three dayes, in whiche no man woulde buye it, or ſette it in price: in ſo muche as the Pretorians were deſpited that no man would giue money, and the common people in greate ſadneſſe that they woulde ſell it. The fourth day after Pertinax was ſlaine, as Didius Iulianus was at ſupper with greate pleaſure, and talking howe the Empire continued in proclamations, his wife, daughter, and ſonne in lawe perſuading him to aduēture to buy it ſince the Pretorians were growne to ſo great wante of ſhame as to ſell it. Iulianus conſideringe of the one parte what was ſaide by proclamation, and on the other parte, what his friendes did perſuade him, left his eating, caſt downe his heade, and gaue him ſelfe profoundlie to conſider of the matter, whiche is to wéete, whether it were ſimplicitie to leaue, or vilanie with money to buy the common wealth.
               
                  Iulianus being verie penſatiue with him ſelfe, and indetermined, his wife, daughter, and kinſfolke, yet againe replied, ſaying, that it was not nowe time to blinde him ſelfe with ſtudie, but to profite him ſelfe by his money: and that alſo he had to conſider, that it were leſſe euill to buy

the Empire with his owne proper money, thē as other, to obteine the ſame by loſſe of mens liues: and that he ſhoulde not care to deferre the euente by delayes, ſince the Pretorians grewe diſpleaſed, and proclamations to be cut off. As Iulianus naturally was proude, founde him ſelfe riche, and alſo importunated by his friendes, he determined to buy the Empire: and for the purpoſe preſently goeth to the foote of the wall, and crieth out vnto the watch that was thereon, ſaying: for bloud, ye knowe me to be deſcended of noble Romanes, and in riches moſt wealthy: and that he woulde giue them ſo muche money for the Empire, that they ſhoulde be abaſhed to ſée it, and tyred to tell it. The Conſul Sulpitius, father in lawe vnto the Emperour Pertinax, in ſecrete did ſolicite the Pretorians to giue him the Empire, not to the ende he woulde buy it, but that they ſhoulde electe him: but the Pretorians although they ſawe that he was a noble Romane, and not vnworthy, but verie conuenient for the Empire, they durſte not put them ſelues into his handes, doubting that he afterwardes remembring the death of his ſonne Pertinax, would execute on them ſome rigorous reuengement. Sulpitius was a man wiſe and ſapient, repoſed, and auncient: with the good wil of the Senate, and requeſt of the people, to him and no other woulde they haue giuen the Empire: and doubtleſſe had it not béene for the aliaunce which he had with Pertinax, who was his ſonne in lawe, they woulde rather haue giuen it him franckely for nothinge, then haue ſolde it vnto the other for money. The Pretorians being muche deſpited, that they might not receiue money for the Empire, ſince foure dayes they had proclamed the ſale thereof, and nowe finding Iulianus at the foote of the wall, who had offered money for ye Empire, they put downe a ladder, and toke him vp vnto them. Nowe, when Iulianus ſawe him ſelfe in grace with ye Pretorians, and ye Pretorians hauing him in their handes, they demaunded

more then he poſſeſſed, and hee did offer more then hee had. The caſe was thus: that they with him, and he with them, did capitulate iiii. thinges, whereof none was to the honour of Rome, &amp; much leſſe to the profite of the common wealth. Their firſte capitulation was, that he ſhould giue them preſently 300000. ſextercies:
the ſecond was, that he ſhoulde neither reuenge the death, or ſuſtaine the fame of the Emperour Pertinax: the third was, that he ſhould erect ye picture, &amp; renewe the memorie of Commodus: the fourth was, that freelie they might do, vnder his Empire, as they had done in the dayes of Commodus: in ſuch wiſe, that Iulianus did not onelie buy the Empire for money, but alſo gaue them licence to liue wickedlie. This donne and concluded, the euent of the Empire was ſtopt in Iulianus, the Pretorians receiuing him in the mids, and attending him throughout all the citie, publiſhinge with loude voices, Long life be euer vnto the Emperour Iulianus, Commodus alwayes Auguſtus.
                  
                  Iulianus would take that ouername of Commodus, to do thē pleaſure that had ſould him the Empire: who in their nourture were bred vp wt 
                  Commodus, &amp; in their manners and vices as his owne naturall children.
            
            
               CHAP. III. Of the great and mortall hatred which the Romaines did beare vnto Iulianus, for buying the Empire.
               
                  Iulianus being created Emperour, his firſt act was, to offer vnto ye gods ſūptuous ſacrifices: being (as it was) the cuſtome of all newe Romane Emperours, preſentlye he ſent vnto his treaſurie for money, to pay them of whom he had bought the Empire. It was a monſtruous matter to ſée ye iuels that he brought forth, &amp; the diuerſitie of money which he had: the cauſe therof was, that he

had bene a gouernour in diuerſe kingdomes, and from them al, brought no ſmall ſūmes of their coyne.
Incontinēt after Iulianus obtained the Empire, he brought his wife and daughter vnto ye court, whoe toke vpon them ye names of Auguſtaes, &amp; began to be ſerued, not as Empreſſes, but as Goddeſſes: becauſe in their ſtatelineſſe &amp; preſumption, they ſought rather to be adored then ſerued. The Conſul Sulpitius at the houre in which he vnderſtode that Iulianus had bought the Empire, departed vnto a certeine houſe that he had in the countrie, giuing his office vnto Cornelius Repentinus his ſonne in lawe, who (as they ſay) did much reſemble Commodus, namely, in diſpoſition of perſon, and corruption of manners.
                  Iulianus gaue vnto the army moſt great thanks, not only for that they had giuen him the Empire, but alſo becauſe they had intituled his wife &amp; daughter Auguſtaes and without his requeſt alſo, had giuen him the name of Pater Patriae, father of ye coūtrie: which title was ye moſt famous yt ye 
                  Romans gaue vnto their Emperours. On ye other day after he was intituled Pater patriae, early in the morning they founde theſe Latine letters written vpō his gates: P.V.E.P. ſoūding in this ſenſe, Proditor, Venditor, Emptor, Patriae: and thus meant in engliſh: thou art the traytor, the ſeller, &amp; buyer of thy country.
                  Vnquenchable was the fury &amp; hatred yt the whole people conceiued againſt Iulianus, only for yt he had bought the Empire, which rancor and hatred they coulde not ſo couer within their breaſtes, but that they publiſhed it with their tounges, and ſhewed it with their handes: for on the firſt day that he came forth into Rome, they not onely blaſphemed him in the ſtretes, but alſo from their windowes threwe ſtones at him: neither did they dine, ſuppe, or walke in Rome, or in all Italie, but alwayes their talke was of ye treaſon which the Pretorians had committed in ſelling the Empire, &amp; the greate miſchiefe that Iulianus had done in buying the ſame.
               
               The Senate going to the highe Capitol, to viſite the

newe Emperour, reſiſtance was made againſt them: which was not done with armed people, but by boyes in the ſtréetes hurling ſtones at them, and the women from their windowes did curſe them: which being conſtoered by the Senate, they aduiſed for that time, to returne to their houſes, no leſſe offended, then ſéared.
Al men bewayled the caſe with manie teares, and offered vnto their Gods many ſacrifices, humbly praying that it might pleaſe them, ſhortlie to take away the life of Iulianus, &amp; to execute cruel vengeance on yt murderers of Pertinax. On a certaine time the Circen playes beeing
prepared, and the ſeate emperiall placed aloft vpon the Theater, when the Emperour Iulianus ſhoulde haue ſet, certaine of ye people raſhly not only did remoue it, but alſo did breake it in péeces: and he as he was wiſe and aduiſed did féele it as a man, and did diſſemble it as one that was diſcrete. Beſides that whiche they ſayd in his abſence, they deſpiſed him in his preſence: and he happened manie times to heare with his owne eares, wordes not a little ouerthwarte and iniurious: but he was ſo ſubtile in that whiche he ſaide, and no leſſe diſſembling in that whiche he hearde, that all the iniuries whiche they ſaide or did, either he toke them in leſte, or did counterfete, not to heare them.
Naturally Iulianus was a prince of greate vrbanitie, that is to ſay, courteous, affable, gratious, and pleaſaunt, and did honoure &amp; reuerence euery man according to the merit of his perſon &amp; the eſtate which he held: yet notwithſtanding, he could neither get frinds, either apeaſe enimies. Neither
Catiline with his tyrannies, either Silla wt his ſeditiōs, either Nero with his cruelties, either Commodus wt his vices, were not vniuerſallie ſo muche hated in the Romane Empire, as Didius Iulianus: and their hatred was ſo extreme, that they ſhut their eyes, becauſe they woulde not beholde him: and did abſtaine to murmur at him, becauſe they woulde not name him. When they ſawe his horſſe paſſe the ſtréetes where on hee

did vſe to ride, generally they would praye vnto the Gods that he might traile him: or if they had ſéene his meates carried, they did wiſhe it might choke him: finally, they did all abhorre his life, &amp; wiſhed his death. Iulianus his enimies bruted among the people, that on the daye, when the Pretorians had ſlaine Pertinax, he had made a generous and curious banket, wherein he gaue to eate oyſters of the Adriatike Seas, Capons of Capua, wine of Creete, and water of Cantabria: but aboue all, had Muſicke and daunceing after dinner.
Others ſaide, it was moſt falſe, but on that day he kept his houſe, and of pure ſorrowe to ſée Pertinax ſlaine, did not eate, vntil they had giuen a ſepulture vnto the dead bodie. Moreouer they ſaye, that although Iulianus was gladſome, pleaſant, and alſo vicious, yet he did not excéede in extraordinarie expences, and that it was vnlikely and alſo impoſſible, for him to haue made ſo ſumptuous a banket: for it was many times notorious vnto al mē, yt he did eate in his houſe no other fleſh by the ſpace of iii. dayes, but on Hare, whiche was ſent him.
He was ſuch a miſer to ſpend, &amp; ſo deſirous to hoord and lay vp money, yt had it not béene for ſome dayes of ſacrifices, or his bidden gueſts, not a morſel of fleſh was eaten in his houſe: but only fed of his prouiſion from his garden.
Many euil cuſtomes that Pertinax had remoued from the common wealth, brought in by Commodus, he conſented yt the Pretorians &amp; other vicious perſons ſhould vſe them: not that he delighted therein, but to recouer them to be his friendes. At all times when talke was moued of his predeceſſour Pertinax, he would ſay neither good nor euil, but that either he changed into ſome other matter, or elſe by diſſimulation would ſéeme not to heare. And being demaunded, why he did neither alowe or condemne that which was ſaide of Pertinax in his preſence: he aunſwered, of the one parte Pertinax was ſo holy, that there was not in him to be reprehended: and of the other parte, he was ſo hated of ye pretorians, that he durſt not in their preſence giue him his due commendation.
            
            
               
               CHAP. IIII. ¶Of two Romaine Capteines named Seuerus and Peſſenius that rebelled againſt the Emperour Iulianus.
               AT the time that Iulianus bought the empire of Rome, there was a Pretor of the armies in Aſſyria, named Peſſenins Niger: who although he was inferiour vnto Iulianus in wealth, yet in vertue he excéeded Iulianus: this Peſſenius was a man, groſſe, rough, and of greate courage, and naturally was more happie in martiall affaires, then fortunate in the gouernement of the common wealth: all which procéeded, for that in periles he was not daunted with feare, and in trauels had no patience. At the firſt letters that Peſſenius receiued from Iulianus, they ſaye, he aunſwered: the Romane Empire, doth not vſe to ſuffer it ſelfe to be gouerned by ſo euil a man, as is Iulianus: wherefore, if this commaundement be onely from the Emperour, I obey it: but if it be Iulianus commaundement, I appeale from it: wherupon it followed, that from thenceforth, when any commaundement was ſent vnto Peſſenius from Rome, Iulianus name was not in the firme thereof, but onely ſuperſcribed with the Emperour of Rome. After this matter was diſcouered, in Rome, they laide great wagers, which was moſt to be praiſed, the minde of Peſſenius for his haughtie attempt, or the patience of Iulianus that could diſſemble the ſame. Alſo at that time the armies were gouerned in Illyria, by a capteine named Septimius Seuerus, borne in Africa, and bred in Rome, which in iuſtice was verie right, in condition ſharpe, and in martial affaires moſt fortunate. This Septimius Seuerus from the houre he had intelligence of the death of the Emperour Pertinax, and that in his place ſuccéeded Iulianus, would neither receiue letter,

either obey commaundement, that came from Iulianus, either elſe from the Senate: ſaying, that they for conſenting, and he for buying the Empire, were inabilitate of all power to commaund or to gouerne: and further, an euil friend was Iulianus vnto Pertinax, that ſold his bloud vnto enimies, and bought his Empire for money. But the caſe was thus, that Peſſenius in Aſſyria, and Seuerus in Illyria, reuolted with all their armies againſt Iulianus: whereof being aduertiſed, they ſaye that he ſaid: the gods be pleaſed to retaine in my ſeruice, all ſuch as be in peace: ſmall is my care, if the reſt had taken their leaue. Although Iulianus ſaide thus much openly, ſecretely he conceiued the contrarie, which was afterwardes better knowen by his works which he did, then by the words which he ſaide. If Seuerus had deadly hatred vnto Iulianus, moſte ſurely Iulianus was not in loue with Seuerus: for preſently, when he vnderſtood that he had rebelled againſt him, he framed and brought to paſſe in the Senate, that Seuerus was proclaimed a publique enimie of the people of Rome, and all his armie diſpatched and condemned. The Senate prouided at the requeſt of Iulianus, that Veſpertinus Candidus, a man both olde &amp; a Conſul ſhould departe to Aſſyria &amp; Illyria: which was not onely diſobeyed in the armies, but alſo not ſo much as heard: the cauſe therof was, the infamous Ambaſſage which he brought: &amp; becauſe afore time, he was much hated being a Pretor in the warres. After Veſpertinus was returned vnto Rome, they ſent againe vnto Illyria, Valerius Catulus, but to ſmall purpoſe: for if they diſobeyed the prouiſions of Candidus, at Valerius they ran with lances. Candidus &amp; Valerius being returned to Rome, Iulianus and the Senate ſent againe Aquilius Centurius, who had comaundement to kil Seuerus, &amp; that by any manner yt he might: that is to ſay, either fighting wt him in the field, or ſecretely to giue him poiſon. Seuerus being aduiſed, howe the Emperour Iulianus and the Senate had ſent the third time Aquilius againſt him, determined to bring foorth his armies

from Illyria, and to come to Rome to ſéeke Iulianus: and marched with ſo greate ſpéede vppon the way, that when Aquilus came foorth of Rome, Seuerus was then in the confines of Italie. Incredible was the feare that fell on yt 
                  Romanes, after they vnderſtood that Seuerus was come againſt them with all his armies: and their terrour was increaſed, to conſider that he was a capteine of Rome, which vntil that time, had béene a defender of the cōmon wealth, and alſo for that he had made ſo great ſpéede vpon the way, and leade his armies with ſo great reformation, that in one and the ſelfe ſame day, they heard of his arriuall, and alſo behelde him in the face. The Capuans ſent a ſolemne ambaſſage vnto Seuerus, to be aduertiſed of the purpoſe of his iourney, and to offer him their help and aſſiſtance: whome Seuerus receiued with great benignitie, and ſaide theſe wordes in greate ſecrecie. I come not to deſtroye Italie, either haue I taken armour to go againſt my mother Rome: the ende of my comming is for three thinges: which is to weete, to reſcue the Empire from the tyrant Iulianus, to reuenge the death of the Emperour Pertinax, that was old &amp; honourable, &amp; to refourme the Senate, of ſuch as dare amongeſt them to aduenture to giue euil counſel: for that I conceiue to ſerue my common wealth no leſſe, in clenſing vices, then defending enimies. That which Seuerus ſaide vnto the Ambaſſadours of Capua in ſecrete, preſently they diſcouered openly: which being vnderſtood in Rome, the Senatours receiued thereof greate ſorrowe, and the people greate pleaſure: becauſe the one did hope to attaine libertie, and the other did feare chaſticement.
               
                  Iulianus gathered all his men of warre, to the vttermoſt of his power, and ſent them againſt Seuerus, vnder the conduction of Tullius Criſpinus: the which, after he was aduertiſed that Seuerus had taken Rauenna, and all the countrie adioyning, returned vnto Rome: which feminine acte gaue diſmaye vnto Iulianus, and courage vnto Seuerus.
               
               
                  
                  Iulianus alſo commaunded a muſter to be made in the field of Mars, of all the Pretorian armies, and he him ſelfe came to take a view, and an accompt of them, conferring ſuch as came vnto the muſter, with the names that were written and receiued money at the paye: of thrée partes, there appeared not one: whereof Iulianus collected, that Seuerus came not onely with confidence of ſuch as he lead with him, but alſo of them which remained in Rome.
               
               Greate pleaſure was it vnto the popular ſorte, to beholde howe Iulianus was forſaken of his capteines, and not attended on of his Pretorians: becauſe euery daye their hatred did increaſe againſt him, and their loue with Seuerus. Notwithſtanding Iulianus procured munition &amp; victuals, repaired the walles, made trenches, aduaunced engins, and ſent ſcoutes into the fieldes: all which deuiſes ſmally profited the ſorrowfull Emperour Iulianus: for if he helde the walles of Rome, his enimies poſſeſſed the heartes of the Romaines. Iulianus ſuſpecting that Letus and Martianus being two Conſuls, and men of greate reputation, ſhould practiſe with Seuerus, commaunded them to be ſlaine, without accuſation or iudgement.
            
            
               CHAP. V. ¶Howe by the commaundement of the Senate, the Emperour Iulianus was ſlaine.
               
                  VNtill Iulianus had ſlaine the afore named noble Conſuls, the Romaines reputed him onely couetous and ambitious, but from thencefoorth they publiſhed him to be couetous, ambitious, ſuſpicious, and cruell: for it was a lawe amongeſt them much vſed, to take away the life of no citizen of Rome, before he were heard to ſaye for him ſelfe. After that Iulianus perceiued the Senate to growe ſorrowfull, and the people eſcandalized, for the death of

                     Letus and Martianus, he came to greate repentance, although to ſmall purpoſe: for it was paſt his handes to giue life vnto the dead, either to reconcile him ſelfe into the grace and fauour of the liuing.
                  Princes and miniſters of iuſtice ought to be very muche conſidered, and no leſſe aduiſed, in crediting their ſuſpicions, and to auoide either choler or raſheneſſe in their executions: to the ende, that after it happen not, that for the deedes of one daye, they haue to remedie and alſo to bewaile all the dayes of their life.
               
               With greate inſtance Iulianus requeſted the Senate, that they with the Prieſtes and veſtall virgins would méete Seuerus and his armie with proceſſion, to ſée if they might pacifie with prayers whome they might not reſiſt with armes. This ſuite the Conſul Fauſtius reſiſted, ſaying, that it were not conuenient, that the ſacred Senate, either the Prieſtes of the temples, or the holie veſtall virgins, ſhould intend matters of warre: for the office of ſuch was to ſolicite the Gods to giue vs peace: and further, the Conſul Fauſtius ſaide: he that poſſeſſeth an Empire, and knoweth not to defend an Empire, containeth the indignitie of an Empire. This anſwere was no leſſe diſpleaſant vnto Iulianus, then pleaſant vnto the Senatours, whereby he obteined not, that which he deſired, and they grewe vnbridled to ſpeake at large. Iulianus not contented with that which was done, but called in ſecret certeine his capteines and friendes, whome he commaunded ſoudeinly to enter armed into the Senate, and to ſaye vnto the Senatours, that of two thinges they had to make choyce, that is to ſay: to loſe their liues, or elſe to obey his commaundementes. Amongeſt the other capteines there was one named Criſpinus, which ſaide vnto Iulianus, he is to be thought no ſmall enimie of thine, that gaue this counſell: becauſe, if thou be well aduiſed, for thy loue the Senate haue declared them ſelues to be an enimie to Seuerus: and nowe, if thou attempt to kil them,

they will aunſwere, that they will obey thée: and on the other parte, they will declare Seuerus to be a friende vnto the people, and thou an enimie vnto Seuerus: and further, the Gods neuer permitte, that thou ſhouldeſt giue foorth any ſuch commaundement, or that I ſhould perfourme it: for, if he be euil that giueth euil counſell, more vile is he that executeth the ſame. Iulianus chaunging his conceite, practiſed with the Senate, that he woulde yelde vp the Empire vnto whome it might pleaſe them: which they liked verie well, but durſt not at that preſent to debate therein: for Seuerus at that time was ſo neare vnto Rome, that it was rather in his handes to take the Empire, then to receiue it at the handes of the Senate. Iulianus forgate not to ſende his Capteine Criſpinus againſt Seuerus: againſt whome, Seuerus ſent another capteine named Iulius Lucius, who ouercame in the battaile, and ſlewe Criſpinus.
               
               When Iulianus conſidered howe his enimies preuailed, and his friendes did forſake him, he purpoſed to take the aduiſe of Witches, inchaunters, and ſootheſayers, to vnderſtand his deſtinies, and the Fortune of Seuerus: and the caſe was thus: that after he aſſembled many Sorcerers and Magicians in his owne houſe, he made them practiſe many ſorceries and inchauntments, and to ſing and praye many filthie, terrible, and fowle thinges. And (as they after reported which were preſent) he him ſelfe chaunged countenaunce, and with ſtaring hayres, diſcouered him ſelf to be in great terrour. Iulianus came vnto the Senatours, crauing their aduiſe, howe he ſhould prouide and behaue him ſelfe: for that Seuerus approched, and fauoured of Fortune, who had him in contempt.
               None of the Senatours aunſwered one worde, but the Cōſul Geminus, which ſaid: neither art thou worthie of counſell, or deſerueſt remedie, ſince thou haſt forſaken the Senators, which ſhould haue giuē thee counſell, and

wenteſt vnto Sorcerers, who could not but deceiue: for that in ſuch a caſe, being inuironed with ſiniſter fortune it had beene more ſounde and ſure counſell, to haue gone vnto the prieſtes, to haue pacified the Gods with their ſacrifices, then vnto ſorcerers which by witchcrafts ſhould leade thee into their indignation. Iulianus ſent vnto Capua, all his guarde, &amp; the ſwoorde players of Rome, whoſe capteines were Lelius Titianus, and Claudianus Pompeyanus, which he did to the ende Seuerus ſhoulde thinke, that ſince he had courage to ſende to offende him, he ſhould haue no leſſe to abide him. The father in lawe of Iulianus was named Aratmenſis, whome Iulianus perſuaded and requeſted to take halfe the Empire, in ſuche wiſe, that bothe ſhould haue béene intituled Emperours of Rome: and ioyntly therewith ſware and affirmed, that he did it not to remedie the neceſſitie wherein he ſtoode: but for greate good wil which he did beare him: who aunſwered, this which thou ſayeſt, Iulianus, be thou aſſured, that I will neither do it, either do I loue, but yrketh mée to heare it: becauſe to gouerne the Empire I am blinde, to traueile I am weake, and to inioye it am become olde: and much more reſpecting the age which I poſſeſſe, and the trauels which I haue paſſed: I am more apte to make peace with the Gods, then to take warres in hande againſt men.
               All the men of warre that were in Etruria, did paſſe vnto the ſeruice of Seuerus, whome he would not by any meanes receiue, vntil they had ſworne to be innocent of the death of Pertinax. Seuerus at the breake of the day, diſcouered him ſelfe with all his armies, two leagues from Rome: whiche being knowen vnto the Senate, ioyntly they agréed to determine two thinges: whiche is to wéete, to remoue Iulianus from the Empire, and to depriue him of his life, and in his place to elect Seuerus Emperour.
               Then one of the Senatours came foorth from the Senate, and publiſhed with open voice vnto the people,

that they ſhould hold it for certeine, that by the authoritie of the ſacred Senat, Iulianus was depriued of the Empire, and in his ſtéede Seuerus elected Emperour.
Great was the ioy that the people receiued, when they heard Iulianus to be depriued of the Empire: and preſently at the inſtant who beſt might, made moſt haſt to receiue the newe Emperour: and none paſſed by Iulianus houſe, that threw not ſtones at the windowes, and ſpat not vppon the walles. At the houre that the Senate went forth to receiue Seuerus, they ſent a Gentleman to kill Iulianus, who expreſſing the ſorrowful ambaſſage which he brought, with many teares Iulianus requeſted that he might not be ſlaine, before hee had ſéene Seuerus: but the gentleman durſt do no leſſe, then to cut off his head, becauſe the Senate ſtayed at the porte Salaria, and had ſworne not to procéede to receiue Seuerus, vntill they were certeinly aduertiſed, that Iulianus was ſlaine. The vnfortunate Emperour Iulianus being dead, his wife Malia and his daughter Eſcutilia tooke the body, &amp; buried him in a Sepulcher of his great graundfather, on the right hand of the way of Lauinia. Iulianus was noted to be a glutton, a gamſter, couetous, and ambitious: and on the other part, he was pitifull, amorous, eloquent, graue, and ſubtile. He liued 56. yeares and 4. monethes: be reigned 11. monethes and 5. dayes. After his death they did neither giue his body honourable funeralls, or contemned his Sepulcher. This was the end of Iulianus, who being old, honourable, &amp; rich, would for the exchaunge of the Empire, giue his goods, aduenture his fame, and looſe his life.

               CHAP. I. ¶Of the linage and countrie of the Emperour Seuerus.
               
                  THE auncient linage of the Emperour Seuerus was of Africa, his grandfather was named Fuluius Pius, and his grandmother Agrippa, which came and died in Lepe, an auncient citie in Mauritania, &amp; was deſtroyed in the warres of Iugurtha, &amp; Maſſimila: his father was named Geta, and his mother Fuluia Pia, a people neither renowmed in armes, or glorious in bloud, either indued with riches. 
                     Seuerus was borne in Etrutio, Clarus and Seuerus being Conſuls, the 4. day of April: and as his mother reported, ſhe had with him
a difficult childbirth, &amp; very tedious to nourſe. In his firſt infancie, he chiefly delighted to play with other children his fellowes, the play of Iudges: and when his lot fell to be Iudge, as ſharpely did he chaſtice their trifling faultes, as he did afterwards chaſtice their errours in earneſt. Hee learned the Gréeke and latine tongues with ſuch ſingular perfection, and was ſo prompt to ſpeake, write, read, &amp; diſpute in the ſaid tongues, as if hee had béene borne in thoſe countries, and learned no other languages.
At the age of xviij. yeres he was a publique aduocate, and defended cauſes in lawe: in ſuch wiſe, that if he had followed Science, as hée did Warres, hée had béene no leſſe renowmed in ſcience and letters, then he was famous in armes. He was not full xx. yeares of age, when he firſt entered Rome: in which dayes, there reigned the right happie Marcus Aurelius, and by interceſſion of his kinſeman Septimius Seuerus, hée had the office to regiſter daily ſuch as either died

or were borne in Rome: which office, although it were not profitable, yet was it an occaſion of great acquaintance, &amp; to be throughly knowen: becauſe nightly he wēt to Court to report who was borne, or had died that day.
The firſt night yt he entred Rome, by chance his hoſt wher he lodged was reading the life of ye Emperour Adrian, wherin was relation of ye great perils which he paſſed, before he might atteine the Empire: Seuerus ſaid vnto his hoſt in ieſt. In trauels &amp; perills I imitate Adrian: I hope alſo that I ſhall ſuccede him in the Empire. By chance, as ye Emperour M. Aurelius made a general &amp; ſumptuous ſupper vnto many noble Romans, Seuerus was amongeſt them, &amp; at the time that he ſhuld haue taken his ſeat at the table, wtout regard he placed him in the Emperours chaire: and when others derided him for his negligence &amp; folly which he had comitted, Seuerus aunſwered: Peace &amp; gibe not, it is poſſible (my deſtinies may be ſuch) that as I nowe ſitt in the imperiall chaire in ieſt, ſo one day I may ſit therin in earneſt. Seuerus dreamed on a night, yt he ſuckt the teats of the wolfe yt nourſed Remus and Romulus, which dreame he alwayes held for a great good ſigne of his future Empire.
In ye time of his youth, he was both abſolute and diſſolute, eſpecially in womens matters, &amp; other vanities: for which cauſes hee was many times taken, baniſhed, &amp; ſhamed. In the offices of warre, he was placed in them all, eſpecially the office of Queſtor, which he held long time: and it is ſaid of him, that hauing by that office charge of monie, he was diligēt in recouering, &amp; faithful in diuiding &amp; parting therof. In ye moneth of Ianuary, in the 5. yeare of the Empire of M. Aurelius, it chaunced him to be Proconſul of Betica, which now in Spaine is named the kingdome of Andoloizia, where he remained ye ſpace of a yeare &amp; a halfe: in which gouernment he was no leſſe loued then feared, and feared then loued.
               
                  Seuerus being Proconſul in Betica, receiued newes of his fathers death in Africa: wherupon he preſently paſſed into Africa, partly to execute the obſequies, and to giue his father an honourable Sepulcher, and partly to take

order for a ſiſter that was left vnto him, and goods whiche he did inherite. The Conſul that then was reſident in Africa, ſent Seuerus for his Embaſſadour to the Sardinians, which were reuolted from the Romanes: and entering into Sardinia with certeine burning torches, according to the maner of an Embaſſadour of Rome, there came vnto him a towneſman after the faſhion of a ieſter, and did imbrace him, whom Seuerus commaunded to be whipt, ſaying: In the act of ſo great grauitie, trifling gibes be inconuenient. For that which this ieſter did, and for the diſgrace which Seuerus receiued, they ordeyned in Rome, that from thence forth, Embaſſadours alwayes ſhould enter all cities on horſebacke, as in times paſt they had vſed on foote. Continuing Proconſul in Africa, he would néeds vnderſtand of a Mathematiciā or Aſtronomer, how farre his fortune extē
                  ded or did reach: and hauing receiued the day and houre, and alſo the aſcendent of his natiuitie, the Aſtrologian being amaſed and terrified of the Fortune which his natiuitie did promiſe him, ſaid vnto him: It is not poſſible that this be thy natiuitie, &amp; therfore were it meete thou ſhouldeſt giue me thine owne, and not the natiuitie of another: for were it true, that thou waſt borne vnder ſuch a cōſtellation, thou ſhouldeſt be Emperour of Rome. 
                  At the age
of 32. yeares, hée was in Rome elected Tribune of the people: more for the pleaſure of Marcus Aurelius whome he ſerued, then for the ſeruice that Seuerus had done in the common wealth: but afterwards he proued ſo toward, and was ſo vpright in cauſes of iuſtice, that it neither repented the cōmon wealth to haue choſen him, either Marcus Aurelius to haue procured the ſame.
His Tribunal office being ended, he was named Pretor of the people: and on the day of his election, the more to aduaunce his honour, the Emperour paſſing throughe the ſtreates of Rome, placed him with himſelfe in the Licter: which déede was not a litle reproched, of ſome through enuie, and of otherſome thorough diſdaine.
            
            
               
               CHAP. II. ¶ Of the offices which Seuerus held in the Empire, before he was Emperour.
               THe affaires of Spaine being diſpatched, Seuerus failed into Aſia: and aſſone as he had ſet his foole a land, hee departed vnto Athens: partly to behold the gouernement of the Greekes, and partly alſo to heare the doctrine of Philoſophers: becauſe in thoſe dayes, they talked not of any matter more in all this world, then of the great Fortune of the Romanes, and the profound eloquēce of the Greekes. Not a few dayes he remayned in Athens hearing the Philoſophers, conferring with the Senatours, viſiting temples, and viewing buildings: becauſe naturally he was a friend of new inuentions, &amp; deſired no leſſe the knowledge of antiquities. Although Seuerus of perſon was valiant, and Capitaine of Rome, and alſo of indifferent eloquence, yet they gaue him no good interteinment in all Grecia: for which cauſe when he came afterwardes vnto the Empire, he ſtreightly reuenged the olde vnkindneſſe which he bare vnto the Greekes, euery day diminiſhing their priuiledges. Being returned from Aſia vnto Rome, hee was ſente Embaſſadour vnto the prouince of Lugdune, which nowe in Fraunce, is named Lion of Sonorona: and being at that time a widower, they practiſed with him a marriage with a certeine Lady of noble bloud, in countenance moſt faire, and gratious in geſture. That Lady was named Iulia, &amp; of royall bloud: vnto whome purpoſing to preſent iewels of great price, and finding no goldſmith ſufficient to performe the ſame: being alſo aduertiſed of a goldſmith in Syria that excelled all men in that facultie, and doubting all meſſengers to be inſufficient, trauelled in his owne perſon, to fetch the ſame: &amp; as he after made reporte vnto his ſpouſe, that with the rewards which he gaue vnto the goldſmith, and the charge of that voyage, hée might twiſe haue béene

maried. The Senators ſēt to reproue Seuerus, not becauſe he had married, but for the great iourney and large expences which he had paſſed for a woman: aduiſing him, that it was not conuenient for a citizen of Rome, to imploy his perſon, but to aduaunce his honour: either conſume his goods, but for defence of the common wealth: whereunto Senerus aunſweared, that for none of thoſe matters wherof he was blamed, he either deſerued blame or puniſhmēt: becauſe without all compariſon, much more was the merite of that Lady with whom he was married, then the expences or trauells which for her ſeruice he had ſuffered. And further he ſaid: it ſeemeth vnto mée (fathers conſcript) that for this acte I deſerue honour, &amp; no blame, ſince thereby ariſeth vnto Rome, both honour and profite: becauſe ſtrange kingdoms haue ſéene, that Captaines of Rome, to obteine riches, haue ſtrēgth &amp; ſkil, and to ſpend them haue noble minds. Seuerus ſtayed ioyntly 3. yeares in Fraunce, both loued and feared, &amp; no leſſe reuerenced of the Frenchmen: not onely for that he was iuſt in iudgment, and liberal in expences, but aboue the reſt, in that he was of a ſincere life. The Calends of Ianuarie being come, (at what time in Rome they diuide their offices) the Proconſulſhip of Sicylia was allotted vnto Seuerus, wherof he receiued no ſmal griefe, partly for that he found himſelf very wel placed in Fraunce, &amp; feared the condition of the Sicylians. Being reſident in the Iſle of Sicyl, he was accuſed by his enimies of Rome, that he did not exerciſe the gouernement of the common wealth, ſo much as the ſearch of ſouthſayers, who ſhould be Emperour of Rome: becauſe in thoſe dayes Commodus was Emperour of Rome, and all men held it for certaine, that for his wickedneſſe he ſhould be ſlaine, or himſelfe, for his great vitiouſnes, ſhould die. Commodus receiued great diſpleaſure when hee vnderſtoode, that being (as hee was) aliue, and but a young man, Seuerus ſhould ſéeke for the ſucceſſion of his Empire: for which cauſe Seuerus was forced preſently to depart from Sicyl, &amp; come to Rome, there to diſcouer and make proofe of his innocencie:

becauſe the daunger was no greater, then loſſe of honour and life. Preſently vppon his arriuall at Rome, he did yéeld himſelfe vnto the gaile Mamortina, and would not depart from thence, vntill by publique ſentence his innocencie was vttered, and his accuſers depriued of their liues. Two monethes after theſe matters paſſed, the Calends of Ianuarie were come, in which Seuerus was elected Conſul, ioyntly with Apuleius Rufinus: the day that this was publiſhed, they ſay that Seuerus ſaid. This day it is manifeſted in mee, that men neither know what proſperities be conuenient for them, either what aduerſities doe impeache them: and I ſay it for this cauſe, for that criminally I was accuſed in Rome, and my perſon priſoner in the place of malefactours: whereof there proceded, that I departed from Sicyl, came to Rome, giue ſafetie vnto my life, augment my goods, recouer fame, take vengeance of mine enimies, and obtaine the Conſulſhip of the common wealth.
               
               The time paſſed of his Conſulſhip, hee ſtoode an whole yeare without any office: and as he afterwards ſaid many times, the beſt and merrieſt dayes of all his life, were conteined in that yeare, wherein he had no office in the cōmon wealth. In thoſe dayes, Letus the Captaine of the guard was greatly in fauour with ye Emperour Commodus: by whoſe interceſſion they cōmended the garriſons of Germanie vnto Seuerus, who ſo ſkilfully behaued himſelfe in that iourney, that he returned 2. yeares after vnto Rome with great honour, &amp; no ſmal riches. At his returne vnto Rome, Seuerus bought a certaine compaſſe of land wherein to till for corne, and to féede and bréede cattell, and alongeſt the riuer Tiber hée bought certaine ſtately and fertill gardens, where hee builte houſes of great pride, which long time after were called Seuerians.
               
               
                  At a certaine time ſupping in thoſe gardens vppon the graſſe, where the freſhneſſe of the greene was verye great, and vigualls very ſmall, the caſe was thus. His owne ſonne, of the age of fiue yeares, did giue and

diuide vnto all perſons, of all thinges that were there, vnto whome the father ſaid: temper thy hand (ſonne) in reparting, becauſe thou haſt no reall riches to giue. The childe made aunſwere: if I haue them not nowe when I am a child, I ſhall haue them when I am a man. All men preſent wondered, conſidering the age of the child, that ſo graue an aunſweare ſhould procéede from ſo tender youth.
               
            
            
               CHAP. III. ¶ How the Pretorians did electe him Emperour.
               IN the 10. yeare of the Empire of Commodus, Seuerus was ſent in meſſage vnto the prouince of Germanie: in which Ambaſſage, he obteyned much honour, and no ſmall wealth: for naturally he was of great diſpatch in affaires, and ſkilfull to gather monie. Hée was reſident in Germanie the ſpace of thrée yeares, that is to ſay, vntill in Rome they had ſlaine the Emperour Commodus: of whole death he had great pleaſure, and of the election of Pertinax no leſſe ioy: becauſe the liuing was his moſt ſpecial friend, and the dead his mortall enimie. Not many monethes after he receiued newes how ye Emperour Pertinax was ſlaine by the Pretorians, and that hée (for very monie) had bought the Empire, he was much gréeued with the death of ye one and the election of the other. Seuerus was aduertiſed how Iulianus was in great hatred of the people, for merchandizing of the Empire: preſently at the inſtant the men of warre that he had with him, declared him Emperour: whiche was done in a citie named Carunto, on the xii. day of the moneth of Auguſt. That day whereon the armies did aduaunce him as Emperour, he gaue and diuided amongſt them ſo great ſummes of monie, as neuer any Emperour had done afore time: for he gaue, not onely all his owne, but alſo the treaſure of his friends. With great ſpeede Seuerus ſent vnto ye armies of Illyria in Pannonia, in Spaine,

Fraunce, and Britaine, and gaue them to vnderſtand how Pertinax was dead, that Iulianus had bought the Empire, and that the armies of Germanie had elected him Emperour: but that hée would not accept the ſame, vnleſſe they (as true defenders of ye Empire) would conſent vnto their election: wherein all, with one conformitie, did alowe that election which the Germaines had made of Seuerus, and vtterly did adnihilate all conſents and elections that had or might be to the aduauncement of the Empire of Iulianus: and vppon condition that Seuerus ſhould firſt be ſworne, to reuenge the death of the good Emperour Pertinax: and to giue his fauour vnto the men of warre. Preſently when ye 
                  Seuerus ſawe his Empire confirmed by the men of warre, ſpéedily he toke his way towards Rome: vpon which way not onely he had no reſiſtance, but in all places was receiued with great ioy. Two Conſuls, 100. Senatours, 30. Queſtors, 22. Iudges, 14. Tribunes, 10. Pretours. 400. prieſtes, and 50. veſtal virgins, came forth to receiue Seuerus: vnto whom he ſent to giue vnderſtanding, that if they would behold his face milde, that all perſons of al armour, either open or ſecret, ſhould diſarme themſelues: for that it was ſufficient that he was of the warres, and they to receiue him in peace. They being perſons of ſo great honour, riches, and auncient, that came foorth to receiue him, were not a litle deſpited, that Seuerus ſhould commaund them to be diſarmed, but in the end they accompliſhed that which was commaunded them, and from thence foorth conceiued againſt Seuerus mortall hatred: becauſe if they diſarmed their perſons of armour, they did arme their hartes with malice. And as Seuerus was proud with his Empire, and the Conſuls and Senatours wiſe and aduiſed, neither did he perceiue them to be offēded, either did they diſcouer themſelues to be gréeued or deſpited: for that, if they had patience to ſuffer the iniurie, they wāted not wiſedome to diſſemble the ſame. As Seuerus was ſubtile and ſkilful, he did two thinges before he entered Rome, wherewith hée greatly wanthe fauour of the common people: wherof the

firſt was, that he publikely changed his ouer name, which is to wit, that as he afore time was named Septimius Seuerus, after he was named Seuerus Pertinax: &amp; this he did, to the end al men ſhould perceiue, ye taking the name of the good Emperour Pertinax, he would likewiſe folow ye ſteps of his good life, and profite himſelfe by his good doctrine: for Pertinax was not only loued as a man, but alſo adored as a God. And the ſecond thing which he did, was, to cōmaund al the bands of Pretorians, which were the men at armes which guarded Rome, that leauing all armour, they ſhuld come &amp; do him reuerence: which were the men yt had ſlaine th'emperour Pertinax, not for his owne deſeruing, but for that he conſented not to their wickednes. Seuerus ſecretly had agréed with his armie, that they ſhould haue regard to compaſſe them round, in ſuch wiſe, yt finding them vnarmed, they ſhould ſtop al meanes to recouer ye ſame for their defence: either place of ſafetie to flie vnto. And now, when they ſtood all vnarmed, &amp; compaſſed, Seuerus commaunded a general ſilence thoroughout his armieꝭ and directed his words vnto thoſe homicides or manſiears, ſpeaking after this maner.
            
            
               CHAP. IIII. ¶How he reuenged the death of the good Emperour Pertinax.
               ALthough al humaine things be ſubiect vnto vanitie &amp; mutabilitie: yet this preeminēce haue ye gods aboue men, yt al things being ſubiect to changing and variablenes, they remaine immutable: &amp; al things periſhing &amp; finiſhing, they for euer do continue: becauſe there is nothing perpetual, but ſuch things, vnto whiche the gods do giue perpetuitie. The great Romaine Empire much reſēbleth the immortal gods of heauen: becauſe all the kingdomes of the earth be finiſhing &amp;

haue their ends, but ſhe is perpetual: all are weake, and ſhe ſtrong: all be ſubiect, ſhe at libertie: all vanquiſhed, and ſhe inuincible: finally, ſhe is ſhe, yt neuer ſuffered her better, or endured another yt was her equal. And as it is moſt true, yt the gods neuer giue reward without a preceding merit: ſo do they not giue puniſhment without ſome fault in him, whom they chaſtiſe: wher of it followeth, yt ſince the gods haue giuen vnto the Romanes ſo many and ſo great triūphes, there ought to be in them many &amp; very notable deſeruings. There be two things which cauſe the Romans to hold frēdſhip with ye gods, &amp; to be lords of mē, which is to wit, great worſhippers of temples, and conſeruers of people in iuſtice: for that countrie where temples be not honoured, and the wicked chaſtiſed, may be better termed a den of theeues, then a kingdome of good men. Ye all vnderſtand that be here preſent, howe ye haue ſlaine the Emperour Pertinax, a mā moſt ſurely both holy and moſt holy, becauſe the greatnes of the Empire, being conferred with the ſinceritie of his deſeruing, it had not beene much for him, but rather a ſmal reward, to haue beene Lord of the whole world. In this deede ye haue offended the gods, eſcandalized men, committed treaſon vnto your Lord, defamed your countrie, troubled your common wealth, and brought all Rome vnto confuſion, in ſuch wiſe, that your fault being ſo exceeding, it may not deſerue any parcialitie in puniſhment.
               Now that ye haue ſlaine him, is it as if ye had ſlaine Caligula, Nero, Sergius, Vitellius, Domitiā, or Commodꝰ? no, but Pertinax, which was one of the princes moſt without reprehēſion, that euer reigned in ye Romaine Empire. As princes be few &amp; wilful, ſo it is a

venture, to chance on ſuch as be good: &amp; ſo much the more deſerue ye the greater paine, as the good Pertinax was profitable vnto the common wealth. Vnto whome ſhall Rome aduenture to commit her truſt, ſince they which were appointed for her guard, haue ſet her a ſale? O treaſon neuer thought of! Oh wickednes neuer heard of! to kill the Emperour, and to ſell the Empire. After the vaſſals haue ſlaine their Lord, and the natiues of the countrie haue ſold their common wealth, I know not why the gods cōmaund not the ground to ſwallow you vp, and preſently put not fire into Rome to conſume it: for, after ſo great an infamie, Rome ought neuer more to be named in this world. Who ſhould haue ſaid to Quintus Cincinatus, Numa Pompilius, Camillus, Marcus Fabritius, Mutius Scaeuola, Silla, Marius, Scipio, Iulius Caeſar, Auguſtus, Germanicus (who with great and many triumphes did both beautifie and magnifie Rome) that ye ſhould haue ſet Rome in open ſale? I firmely beleeue, and am out of doubte, that they would haue died of pure ſorrowe: or elſe would haue ſlaine your progenitours from whom ye are deſcended. Frō the time I departed out of Germanie, I came muſing vppon the way, what puniſhment I ſhould giue you: for of the one part, if I ſuffer euery one of you with his life, it redoundeth to the ſcandal of the common wealth: and if I would take the ſame from you, the paine is very ſmal, in reſpecte of your extreme fault: for vnto one that is euil, they doe him no ſmall benefite, to rid him out of this world. I cōmaund your noſes to be ſlit, your tongues to be boared, your garments beneth the waſt to be cut off, and your beards halfe ſhauen: yee ſhall liue without honour, credite,

or libertie as ſlaues &amp; bondmen in the common wealth: in ſuch wiſe, that ye ſhall not die as the good do vſe to die, to the end to liue: but ye ſhal liue as the wicked do liue, to the end to die. Neither doe I ſuffer you to liue, becauſe ye deſerue life: but for that I will not ſtaine my fame with your filthie bloud. If in giuing you al death, I might giue the good Pertinax his life: not onely yours, but alſo right willingly would I offer mine owne: becauſe there is no vent more iuſt, then yt one good life (by ye exchange of many wicked liues) might be bought &amp; redemed. If the gods would permit, that at the houre I ſhould cōmaunde ye to bee ſlaine, ye ſhould reuiue and recouer life, a thouſand times would I take away your liues, becauſe the horror of your offence deſerueth a thouſād deathes: but ſince loſſe of life, in a momēt, doth deliuer the malefactour of his ſcourge and torment, and afterwardes no other meane remayning to take vengeaunce: it is more iuſt that ye ſhould liue euery day deſiring death, then that ye ſhould die abhorring life. There is nothing more iuſt, then to kil him that killeth: but I commaund not that ye be ſlaine, although ye durſt kill the good Pertinax: and this I do not, to the end to do no iuſtice, either to doe you good or pleaſure: but for that many yeares ye ſhall haue time to bewaile your wretched life, and his innocent death.
            
            
               CHAP. V. ¶Of thinges that he did in Rome, preſently after he was Emperour.
               AFter that Seuerus had ſaid and finiſhed his ſpeach, and cōdemned and baniſhed the murtherers of the Emperour

                  Pertinax, he determined to enter Rome, and his receyuing was mixt with ioy and ſorow: becauſe of the one part ſeing him ſo great a frend of iuſtice, they reioyced: and on the other part to ſée him cōpaſſed with ſo great armies, they feared him. Preſently vpon his entrie into Rome, he viſited ye temples (according to the cuſtome of the Romane Emperours) and there he offered no ſmall, but generous &amp;
ſumptuous ſacrifices. Although in his receyuing, a great part of the day was ſpent, and in viſiting temples the reſt was conſumed, and now whē it was night, he was requeſted of all men to take his eaſe, and to withdrawe vnto his palace: yet he would in no wiſe conſent, vntil he had viſited the Sepulcher of the good Marcus Aurelius: where he remained a great ſpace vppon his knées, and poured foorth many lamentable teares.
The next day he went vnto the high Capitol, where all the Senate was aſſembled, and there he ſpake vnto all the Senatours, Conſuls, and all other Romane officers: to whome he ſaid many good words, and gaue them great hope of many rewards. All the people of Rome were aſtonied, &amp; terrified, to behold the great audacitie and fortune of Seuerus: which procéeded of conſideration howe without daunger, and leſſe trauell, hée obteyned the Empire: for that he gat it not by ſheding others bloud, neither by the exchange of his owne proper goodes. The firſt day that Seuerus ſpake in the Senate, he made a ſolemne vow before them all: Neuer to kill any Romane, if he were not iudged by iuſtice: or to take the goods of any perſon, if by the fiſcal he were not condemned. If it had béene found in Seuerus workes, which hée ſware that day in wordes, namely, that they might not accuſe him of crueltie, either note him of couetouſnes, it had béene a great weale for the Romane Empire: for there is nothing wherwith princes doe more deſtroy their common wealthes, and alſo ſtaine their perſons, then to bee giuen to reuenge their owne proper iniuries, and couetous of other
                     mens goodes. Forthwith at his beginning, Seuerus did ſhew himſelfe milde, benigne, pitifull, liberall, valiant harted,

affable, gratious, and humaine, imbracing his familiars, ioying and laughing with ſtraungers: in ſuch wiſe, that the Romanes went after him, hearing what he ſaid, and praiſing what he did. If in humaine affaires he were prouident, in diuine matters ſurely he was not negligent: for that euery day hée viſited temples, honoured prieſtes, offered ſacrifices, repaired edifices, heard orphans and afflicted: in ſuch wiſe, that in victories they compared him vnto Iulius Caeſar, in humaine policies to Auguſtus, and in diuine thinges to Pompilius. The old Senatours and auncient Romanes, that had béen bred with Seuerus from their youth, were amaſed to ſée how his euil condition was changed: and on the other part they thought with themſelues, that all which he did was but fained: for of his owne naturall condition, he was ſubtile, warie, milde, and double: and did know how to denie his owne will for a time, in that which hée wiſhed, to doe afterwardes with all men all that he deſired.
                  It is a point of wiſe and ſkilfull men, to ouercome their owne wills in ſmall matters: afterwardes to drawe others after them for cauſes of greater importaunce.
               
               Althoughe there bee more credite to bee giuen to that which wée ſée, then vnto that which wée ſuſpect: yet in this caſe they were more deceiued, that praiſed Seuerus in his good woorkes, then thoſe which did ſuſpecte him for his old ſubtilties: for that in ſhorte ſpace they vnderſtoode in him great cruelties, and no leſſe diſordinate couetouſneſſe. Thoſe that from their youth bee not bredd in vertuous woorkes, or that naturally of themſelues bee not of good condition, they may for a time deceiue ſome perſons with their guiles: but in the end their malice commeth to the notice of all men: all which was experimented in Seuerus, who vſed violence with his owne proper nature, vntill hée ſawe himſelfe in poſſeſſion of the common wealth. The firſt office that hée gaue in Rome, was vnto Flauius Iuuenal, whome hee made Pretor of the people: of whiche prouiſion of the one part he pleaſed all men, becauſe Flauius
                  
was a vertuous perſon: and on the other parte it did grieue them, becauſe he was ſeruaunt vnto Iulianus. The whole armie that Seuerus led with him, he alſo brought into the citie of Rome: and being in quantitie great, and of condition proud, they might not be contained within the citie: for which cauſe they lodged not onely in houſes priuileged, and in ſacred temples, but forceably brake vp doores and entred houſes. The Romanes receiued the ſame for a very great iniurie, becauſe they onely felt not the deſpight done vnto their perſons, but alſo did bewaile the breach &amp; loſſe of their liberties. Thrée dayes after Seuerus entered Rome, the captaines of his armies ſent to demaund of the Senate, to haue giuen them an hundred thouſand peſants of gold, which were due vnto them: for that in times paſt, ſo much was giuen vnto them that firſt entered with the Emperour Auguſtus. At the houre when ye captaines ſent theſe words vnto the Senat, preſently and ioyntly they armed themſelues, and marched vnto the field, ſwearing and forſwearing, by the life of Seuerus, &amp; by the world of Marcus, that if it were not giuen that day, at night they would ſack Rome. After that Seuerus heard, that his armie was in readineſſe in the field of Mars, and without his cōmaundement, he was not a litle eſcandalized, thinking there had béene ſome treaſon againſt him amongeſt ye people: but the truth being knowen, he requeſted them to be pacified, and to diſarme themſelues, ſaying: that it proceeded not of wiſe Captaines, but of ſeditious perſons, to demaund with threatenings, that which would be giuen by requeſt. Seuerus ſaw himſelfe in great trauell, to finiſh agréement betwixt the one &amp; the other: but in the end giuing them ſome monie out of his owne coffers, and ſome from the common wealth, he brought them all to a vnitie: which was, yt vnto the Captaines was giuen leſſe then they demaunded, and the Romanes paid ſomewhat more then they offered. Before all things, Seuerus did celebrate the obſequies of Pertinax: whereat all the Romanes were preſent, and offered that day vnto the Gods great ſacrifices, accompting

                  Pertinax amongeſt the Gods, and placeing Prieſtes to do ſacrifices vpon the ſepulchre, that for euermore ſhould ſuſteine his memorie. When Seuerus entred the Empire, he found many rents of ye treaſurie morgaged, which is to wéete, the royall patrimonie, wherein he gaue order for the redéeming thereof, to be reduced vnto the royall crowne. Seuerus had two daughters of ripe age, the one of xxv. the other of xxx. yeres, whome he married within twentie dayes after he came to Rome, the one with Prolus, and the other with Laertius, men of greate wealthe and riches, and generous in bloud. Seuerus offered his ſonne Prolus the office of Cenſor, which he refuſed, ſaying, that he fought not to be ſonne in lawe vnto the Emperour, to be a ſcourge of euill men: but to be ſerued of good men. Seuerus made bothe his ſonnes in lawe Conſuls, and about Rome he bought them great rentes, and alſo gaue them large ſummes of money to ſpend, and to his daughters he gaue Iewels, wherewith to honour them.
            
            
               CHAP. VI. ¶Howe the Emperour Seuerus paſſed into Aſia againſt capteine Peſſenius that rebelled againſt him.
               ONe of the famous capteines that rebelled againſt the Emperour Iulianus, as hath béene recounted in his life, was Peſſenius Niger, who with the armies that were in Aſſyria, did gouerne and rule all Aſia. Seuerus roſe in Germanie, and Peſſenins in Aſia: and notwithſtā
                  ding they were both traitours vnto their Lorde, the difference betwixt them was, that Seuerus for his comming vnto Rome, they aduaunced vnto the Empire: and Peſſenius for remaining at his eaſe in Aſia, was condemned for a traitour. At the houre that Iulianus his death was publiſhed, preſently Peſſenius inueſted him ſelfe with the

title of Emperour and Auguſtus: in ſuch wiſe, that Seuerus in Europa, and Peſſenius in Aſia, had diuided betwixt them ſelues all countries and prouinces: and much more the one from the other had diuided their willes &amp; mindes. Peſſenius was very wel aduertiſed in Aſia, howe Seuerus had entred Rome with a great power: and was in ſtate of gouernement as naturall Emperour of the common wealth: but neither for letters that were written vnto him, or for any thing that might be ſaide vnto him, would he obey Seuerus, or muche leſſe ſhewe any feare of him, Peſſenius was groſſe of perſon, valiant, warlike, and of al men, with whome he dealt, very well liked: and ſurely, if he loſt the Empire, it was not for want of friendes in Rome, but that he abounded with vices in Aſia. After that Seuerus ſawe, that neither for threateninges, either for promiſes that he made, or for letters that he wrote, he might not drawe Peſſenius Niger vnto his ſeruice, he determined to conquer him as an enimie: although (as he afterwardes ſaide) he wiſhed not with him to come in contention: becauſe Peſſenius was a friende in earneſt, and no enimie in ieſt.
               
                  Seuerus commaunded a muſter to be taken of all the men he had, and tooke the names of all perſons that he might haue with him out of Italie, commaundinge them to prepare, and to pay his officers, &amp; that all thinges ſhould be done with moſte ſpéedie diligence: for his intent was to enter with ſo greate haſte into Aſia, that his arriuall, and the newes thereof, at one inſtant, might appeare vnto Peſſenius.
               
               All the armies of Illyria which he had left in Thracia, he commaunded to paſſe into Aſia: and all the Senatours, all the warrelike officers of Rome, all the riche men, and all the ſonnes of mightie and greate Lordes that were in Italie, he ledde with him in that warre.
He armed in the Sea Mediterrane an hundred galleys, and alſo rigged foorth two hundreth ſhippes, fiftie barkes, and innumerable foyſtes: all which went laden with

men, armour, and victuals: in ſuch wiſe, that in reſpecte of his greatneſſe and potencie, there was none that woulde encounter with him by lande, either abide at the Sea.
               
               Onelie xxx. dayes Seuerus was in Rome, diſpatchinge with the Senate, he departed vnto the porte of Hoſtia, to beholde his nauie, and from thence he departed to Nola in Campania, where his armye was aſſembled, where he added many thinges that wanted, and alſo remoued many thinges that were ſuperfluous: becauſe in thinges of greate importance, he was not ſatiſfied to giue them in charge to men of experience: but that he woulde ſee and beholde them with his owne proper eyes. When Peſſenius Niger heard the newes, howe Seuerus came againſt him by ſea and lande: they ſay that he ſaide, theſe woordes: If the deſtinies be bente againſt me, ſmall may it auaile me, that men fauour mee: and if Gods be pleaſed to help me mē may little hinder me. And further he ſaide: Seuerus is not ſatiſfied to haue ſlaine his Lorde Iulianus, and to vſurpe the Empire, but hath made mee an enimie vnto the people of Rome: but I beſeche the immortall Gods, that if it ſhal not pleaſe them to giue me victorie in this warre, that Seuerus may bee conquered, when hee moſte deſireth to ouercome. Although Peſſenius commended his fortune into the handes of God, not withſtanding he left not to ſeeke the aide of men: &amp; to this ende he did write and ſend Ambaſſadours, vnto the kinge of the Parthians, to the king of the Arthabanes, and to the king of the Armenians to ſuccour him with men &amp; money, becauſe Seuerus came with a determinate minde to deſtroy them all.
               The kinge of the Armenians aunſweared the Ambaſſadours of Peſſenius Niger, that he woulde neither helpe the one, or offende the other, but defende and conſerue his owne kingdome: moued therevnto, for that Peſſenius was his friende, and Seuerus not his enimie.
               The kinge of Parthians, preſently ſente his letters

throughout his kingdome, commaunding them to repaire vnto Peſſenius, and refuſe Seuerus: which he did not for the narrowe friendſhip that he helde with Peſſenius, but for the auncient enimitie that he did beare vnto the Romane Empire. The king of Arthabanes ſent vnto Peſſenius, ten thouſand archers with croſſebowes, all natiues of the prouinces of Berſezana, which throughout the worlde were much renowmed, and in the warres no leſſe feared, becauſe they were of valiant mindes in fight, and excéeding readie in ſhooting. Further, Peſſenius Niger commaunded his armie to be renewed with twentie thouſand footemen, and ſixe thouſand horſemen, whereof the moſte parte being taken out of Antioche (where the people be moſt féeble) their names being regiſtred, and receiuing paye, neuer afterwardes came to the warres. Vnto all them that vſed this guyle, Seuerus afterwardes gaue great puniſhment: not for that they had béene traytours vnto Peſſenius, but for example to terrifie others. Vpon the mount Taurus parte of Cappadocia and Sicyl, Peſſenius, as a man of experience in martiall affaires, prouided that the woodes were feld vpon the toppes of mounteines, and in ſtreightes, and moſt perillous places made ſtrong watche and warde, in ſuch wiſe, that no enimie might approche, that was not ſéene: or paſſe, that were not ſlaine. In thoſe dayes, there was not in all Thracia a citie more opulent then was Byzantio, nowe named Cō
                     ſtantinople, which in buildinges did excéede all cities of Aſia, and in fertilitie was equall with the beſt in Europa. Amongeſt other thinges conteined therein that was faire to beholde, and much to be praiſed, were the walles, the ſtones whereof were brought from Myleſius, curiouſly ſquared, as if it had béene timber ſawen with a ſawe: which was the cauſe that the wall being made of many ſtones, the whole wall ſéemed but one ſtone. Although with the calamities of time, the walles be nowe ruinated: yet notwithſtanding, of the ſame there remaineth ſome ſteppes and ſignes: in the viewe whereof there is

none but wil praiſe the witt of them that made it: &amp; curſſe the handes of them that did ſubuert it. When Peſſenius ſawe him ſelfe a Lorde ſo abſolute of all Aſia, and accompanied with ſo many &amp; ſo noble men of warre, he thought him ſelfe ſure of the victorie: but as in ſuch caſes, that which Fortune guydeth, is farre differēt from that which the perſon deſireth: ſo, very cōtrarie to his former purpoſe it afterwardes ſuccéeded.
            
            
               CHAP. VII. ¶Of the warres that paſſed betwixt Peſſenius and Seuerus in Aſia.
               IT was great griefe vnto Seuerus, when he vnderſtoode howe Peſſenius was in ſo greate redineſſe, that thought not onely to defende, but publiquely to offende. Seuerus being certified that Peſſenius was in poſſeſſion of ye greate citie Byzantio, marched with more ſpéede, with intent to batter the ſame, before Peſſenius might come to the ſuccour thereof: for that by ſecrete practiſes, Seuerus had within the citie newe friendes: and Peſſenius in gouernement had recouered ſome enimies. Neither the intelligences which Seuerus practiſed ſecretely, either the diligences whiche he vſed publiquely, might profite him to obteine Byzantio: which when he vnderſtoode, he traueiled to recouer another citie not farre from thence, named Cyzica: which was both rockie and compaſſed with marriſhes, that is to ſaye, it ſtoode vppon a rocke, &amp; inuironed with a riuer. Peſſenius had for his capteine generall of all his hoſtes, a certeine knight named Emilianus, in whome he repoſed confidence, not onely for matters of warre, but alſo for expedition of cauſes of peace, for that he had bothe wiſedome for the one, and fortitude for the other. The capteine Emilianus put him ſelfe into the citie of Cyzica, whē preſently after, the ſouldiours of Seuerus came to beſiege it. There was betwixt both the armies at diuers times,

diuers encounters, &amp; repulſes, wherin Fortune indifferētly diſcouered her ſelfe vnto either partie: for at all times, when they fought at the wall, Seuerus ſide had the woorſe: but when they fought in the field, Peſſenius bandes had yt repulſe. Two monethes after the citie of Cizica was beſieged, they made a ſalle, and as they would haue retyred, Seuerus capteines purſued and entred pelle melle with the capteines of Peſſenius: and notwithſtanding there was betwixt them greate ſlaughter for the recouering of a gate, and to fortifie a certeine place: in the ende Peſſenius loſt the citie, and Seuerus obteined the victorie. Peſſenius greatly complained, and ſo was it bruted amongſt the people, which is to wéete, that the capteine Emilianus had ſecrete practiſe with Seuerus: for, conſidering the ſtately walles wherewith the citie Cizica was compaſſed, and the valiant people wherewith it was defended: al men iudged it impoſſible to take it, and follie to beſiege it. The cauſe that moued the capteine Emilianus to do this vnworthie déede, was: that his ſonnes, who were left at Rome, Seuerus brought with him into that warre, vnder great garde: and it is to be thought, that to giue libertie vnto his ſonnes which he had ingendred, he made a breache of his fidelitie and othe which he had ſworne. The Emperour Commodus, as he was ſuſpicious of them, with whome he had to deale: and ſo euil wiſhed of all ſuch as did ſerue him: ſo it was his faſhion, for the moſt parte, when he ſent any noble Roman to gouerne any prouince, preſently to place their ſonnes in a fort: and this he did, to the end their fathers ſhould not be traitours, reſpectinge their children that were kept vnder ward. From the time that Commodus reigned in Rome, Emilianus gouerned the prouinces in Aſia: by which cauſe Seuerus recouered the children, &amp; Peſſenius loſt the father. The fame being diuulgate throughout all Aſia, that the citie Cizica was ſacked, &amp; that Seuerus kept the field with victorie: all Peſſenius knightes that ſcaped from thence, &amp; all other their companions that heard therof, gaue them ſelues to flight:

to ſéeke places of fortificatiō wherein to hide their perſōs. Seuerus not onely recouered honour &amp; profite of this victorie, but alſo planted both feare &amp; diſcorde almoſte throughout all Grecia: for ſome rebelled againſt Peſſenius, and others did obey Seuerus. Although the people of Grecia haue ableneſſe to learne ſcience, they are no leſſe mutable in martial affaires: for in warres which they proſequute, they follow not the Prince that hath moſt iuſtice, but him that moſt is fauoured of Fortune. The citizens of Bithynia ſent Ambaſſadours vnto Seuerus, ſaying, that they &amp; their children were at his commaundement: and on the other ſide, the people of Nicena gaue Peſſenius to vnderſtand, that if he ſent his armie thither, they woulde not only receiue them, but alſo mainteine them: which offers they preſēted not vnto theſe two Roman princes, for loue or friendſhip that they did beare them: but for the auncient enimitie which they had betwixt them ſelues. Seuerus wt his armie entring Bithynia, and Peſſenius into Nicena, from thence, as from two fortes, they did iſſue to fight: &amp; in the end betwixt the two armies vpon a certeine day, they trauerſed ſo fierce a ſkirmiſhe, that in bloud &amp; ſlaughter it was no leſſe then a battel: where the field remained vnto Seuerus, &amp; Peſſenius bands were put to flight. Peſſeniꝰ neither for the loſſe of the citie Cizica, neither for that he was beaten out of the field at Bithynia, did ſhewe either feare or weakeneſſe: but diuiding his armie that remained in two partes, he ſent the one to mount Taurus to defend that paſſage from Seuerus, &amp; the other parte he ledde with him ſelfe vnto Antioche, partely to take money out of his treaſurie, &amp; partly to renue, as alſo relieue his armie. Seuerus marched wt his armie frō 
                  Bithynia vnto Galatia, &amp; from Galatia vnto Cappadocia, which ſtoode in defence on the behalf of Peſſenius, where Seuerus ſouldiours wt great furie did aſſault the ſame: in which iourney the Seuerians receiued no ſmall loſſe, becauſe the citie was ſituate vpō the ſide of an hill, frō whence to execute ſlaughter amongeſt their enimies, they néeded no other defence, but to whirle ſtones.
               
                  The affaires ſtanding in this eſtate, there chaunced two cities of Phoenicia to reuolt from Peſſenius, and to yelde them ſelues vnto Seuerus, that is to ſaye, Laodycia and Tyrus: of which newes Peſſenius tooke greate griefe, and no ſmall hatred, which paſſions conceiued againſt thoſe cities, he not onely vttered in the foule wordes which he ſent to be ſaide vnto them: but alſo in the cruel acts which he commaunded to be done vnto them. Peſſenius had in his armie fiftéene thouſand archers, which were called Mauri, people that naturally of their owne inclination were giuen to bloud, and without al feare of death: theſe, Peſſenius commaunded to go vnto Laodycia and Tyrus, vtterly to burne and conſume both citie and people: with a warning confirmed by an othe, that if they tooke any priſoners to giue any man life, the perſon that vſed that pitie ſhould be ſlaine. Theſe fiftéene thouſand archers named Mauri departed vnto Laodycia and Tyrus, and manie other that ioyned with them: &amp; as they tooke them at the ſoudeine being vnprouided, and hauing no time to demaund ſuccour of Seuerus: ſo cruell and inhumane was that barbarous people, to thoſe ſo generous and noble cities, that they left not vpon the walles one ſtone vpon an other, either houſe that they ſubuerted not, either the hed of man woman or childe that they did not cutt off. When theſe matters paſſed in Aſſyria, the knightes of Seuerus were in Cappadocia, traueiling greatly to poſſeſſe the mount Taurus: but as it was naturally of great height, and rockie, &amp; Peſſenius poſſeſſing all the paſſages, ſo they might not by any meane aſſaile them, or conceiue hope of any profitable or honourable attempt. Vpon the top of this mount Taurus, Peſſenius his people had brought an huge number of great ſtones and rockes, to throwe down vpon Seuerus ſouldiours, if they ſhould attempt to climbe the hill: but as on the ſide of the mounteine, there grewe many trées, both high and great, which Seuerus ſouldiers cut downe in great heapes &amp; multitudes to ſtay the ſtones before they tumbled vpon men, that might be throwne

In hauing redy captaines to fight, and ſkilfull to defende none of the armies had cauſe to complaine, either of their enimies to haue enuie, except that Peſſenius was more vertuous, and Seuerus more venturous,
            
            
               CHAP. VIII. Of a cruell and furious battell, betwixt Peſſenius and Seuerus, wherein Peſſenius was ſlaine.
               IN certaine broken, worne, and hollowe places, as in ſuche groundes the waters do vſe to make, Peſſenius ſouldiers had fortified wt ſtones &amp; boughes, whiche ſerued them to blinde and ſtoppe the waye for paſſage, as alſo from thence both to defende and offend their enimies. Neither for trauell to climbe the hill, either for feare of death, did Seuerus his captaines ceaſſe any houre to attempt the recouering of the mounte: but the waye
                     •
                   and paſſages were ſo narrowe, and the mountaines ſo rockie &amp; macceſſible, that tenne defended an hundred, an hundred a thouſand: &amp; a thouſand tenne thouſand. The caſe was thus, that the Seuerian armies more daunted with deſpaire, thē aduaunced with hope, ſoudenly on a night there fel vpon Peſſenius ſouldiours retired from theire rampiers, and fortified rockes: and that whiche was worſe, many perſons and beaſtes were there daungered &amp; alſo loſt, and their victualls all caſte and carried away. By time that ſhoulde do the deede, and the ſorrowfull deſtinies of Peſſenius that ſhoulde conduct the ſame: it chaunced vpon the thirde day after the ſnowe had fallen, the ſunne did ſhine with as hote a glome as in ye heate of ſummer, wherwith all the ſnowe being throughly thawed, the violence of moſt furious waters that deſcended the hil, ouerthrewe and carried away all bulworkes and rampiers that Peſſenius had made in that mountaine: in ſuch wiſe, that nature

framed in one houre yt Art might not bring to paſſe in many dayes: that is to ſay, the ſnowe draue away the people, and ſoone opened the way. When the Seuerian armies founde, that Peſſenius ſouldiours had forſaken the mounte Taurus, and ye thawed ſnowe had opened their way: they not onely recouered greate courage, but alſo preſumed to haue obtained diuine fauour: ſaying, that Seuerus did gouerne them, but that the Godds did guide them. Vpon the fifte day after the ſnowe, Seuerus ſouldiours mounted vpon ye toppe of Taurus, &amp; al the ſnowe beeing thawed and gonne, and trackes and wayes beeing dried vp, in euery place they founde deade men, drowned beaſtes, broken armour, and victualls ſcattered: in the viewe whereof they tooke no ſmall pleaſure, becauſe they had nowe ſet their feete, where before they imployed but their eyes. Peſſenius being aduertiſed, howe his ſouldiours had forſaken the mounte Taurus, departed with all his hoſte from Antioche, &amp; toke the way vnto Sicyl: the multitude of people that hee ledde with him was maruelous and terrible to beholde: and yet truly notwithſtanding, more fearefull in viewe, then in fight: for admitting they were many, &amp; younge men well armed, yet they were more accuſtomed to haue peace with vices, then warr wt enimies. Seuerus wt his armies, &amp; Peſſenius wt his hoſtes incountred in Sicyl, not a league one from an other, hauing betwixt them a greate plaine which was named by the men of the country, the field of Yſico, where was giuen the laſte and moſt famous battel betwixt Alexander and Darius, in which the great king Darius was ouercōe, and the great Alexander remained monarche of ye world. In memory of which notable battell, there is ſituated at
theſe dayes, the renowmed citie of Alexandria, wherein there is is a picture of braſſe, ſo naturall a counterfeite of Alexander, that to beholde doth partly terrifie, and alſo giueth motion of great reuerence.
Two dayes after theſe princes came to this place, with conformitie they determined to giue the battell, ſince either of thē had ioyned their

whole powers, with the preſence of their proper perſones: vntill which time, betwixt them there was but ſmall difference, for that either of them had greate hope to haue the victorie. The night before they fought, Seuerus &amp; Peſſenius were both ſadde, and their armies in greate watch: for as the fatall houre of fight drewe neare (although their generous hartes gaue them hope to ouercome) their mortal bodies did feare to die. At the breake of ye day al the captaines made ready to ye battell: continually two houres before the charge, both of the one parte and the other, they played vpō inſtrumētes of muſicke, which wt their melody did yealde ſuch dolefulneſſe, that exactly it diſcouered the ſorrowfull ſucceſſe that ſhoulde followe in that cruell battell. The hoſtes béeing ioyned the one wt the other, there was trauerſed betwixt thē ſo cruel a fight, &amp; of euery parte ſo traueled to obtaine the victory, yt the day ended, &amp; ye battell not finiſhed. That battell was ſo bloudie, wounded, &amp; of both partes ſo much contended, yt within the compaſſe of two leagues, there was not iii. foote of ground, yt was not couered wt mans bloude. If the two armies were valiant in fighting, ſurely ye two princes, their lordes, were no cowardes: but in the ende, when night was come, the Peſſenians turned their backes: &amp; the whole concluſion was, that Peſſenius fledde wounded, and Seuerus remained lorde of yt field. Vpon an horſe of greate ſwiftneſſe, &amp; accompanied wt fewe perſons, Peſſenius tooke the way vnto Antioche: as the enimies did purſue him, at the doore of a poore cottage where he neither had time to reſt, either place to hide him ſelfe, but groueling vpon his breaſtes, drinking with a pitcher, at a blowe his enimies cutte off his head. This was the ſorrowfull end of Peſſenius Niger, vpon whoſe ſepulture they placed this Epitaph: Here lieth Peſſenius Niger, an auncient Romane, whiche in merite was equall with the vertuous: but in miſfortunes exceeded the moſt vnfortunate.
               
               When Seuerus ſawe him ſelfe aduaunced to ſo great victorie, and that in all Aſia, there was not one launce

in the Reſt againſt him, he procured to ſeaze vpon al principall perſons, that had eſcaped from the campe of Peſſenius: and commaunded not onely to kill them all, but alſo to execute them with greate tormentes. Many were founde in the campe of Peſſenius, whiche did followe him againſt their willes, whome alſo Seuerus commaunded to be ſlaine as the reſt: whiche in déede was rather the acte of a cruell tyrante, then a vertuous prince. Seuerus had with him the mother and the ſonnes of Peſſenius, whome he ſente (both mother and ſonnes) baniſhed vnto an Iſlande.
               All thinges ſet in order, that were conueniente for the prouiſion of the good gouernement of Aſia, Seuerus moued talke amongſt his moſte familiar friendes, for the conqueſt of the kinge of Parthia, and the kinge of Thebes: not becauſe they helde him as an enimie, but for that they were friendes vnto his enimie Peſſenius. Seuerus friendes did counſell him, that by no meanes he ſhould publiſh any intente of warre againſte the kinge of Parthians, or the kinge of Thebanes: for ye notwithſtanding Peſſenius was dead in the Eaſt, Albinius was aliue in the kingdomes of the Weſte: and that hee was not ſo ſure of the Empire, but yt it were better counſell for him to ſeeke newe friends, then to awake olde enimies. Seuerus dealt cruelly with the inhabitants of Antioche, becauſe they had receiued and obeyed his enimie Peſſenius, and with them did not onely vſe iniurious wordes, but alſo did diſcharge them of al their auncient liberties. He ſlewe all the Senatours of Rome, that is to ſay, ſuche as folowed Peſſenius and tooke the name of captaines and Tribunes: &amp; of other perſones he ſlewe but one, and woulde neuer ſay, wherfore but he alone, and none other was put to death.
            
            
               CHAP. IX. Of the Conſul Albinius, and howe he rebelled againſt Seuerus being in Englande.
               
                  AMongeſt the moſte extreme young gentlemen, that were bred in the houſe of the good Marcus Aurelius, were three, which in thoſe dayes were placed for captains in the moſt famous and daungerous places of the empire, that is to ſay, Seuerus in Illyria, Peſſenius in Aſia, &amp; Albinius in greate Britaine. Their Lorde Marcus Aurelius had brought them vp ſo expert in ſcience, ſo accuſtomed to vertues, ſo readie in armes, ſo ſkilfull in perills, and ſo made vnto trauels, that if they them ſelues, had not warred &amp; deſtroyed them ſelues, al the world had not bene ſufficient to haue defeated thē. Aboue, it is ſaid, how Seuerus came to Rome to take the Empire, and howe Peſſenius was ouercome in Aſia: there reſteth nowe to ſpeake of Albinius, who was in Britaine: a man in his life righte venturous, and in his deathe no leſſe vnfortunate. Albinius was natiue of Rome, and as ſoone as he was of age ſufficient, he was made a Senatour, being of moſt auncient linage, and did inherite of his predeceſſours, greate wealth, whiche he wanted no ſkill to conſerue, as alſo to increaſe, and excellently to inioy: for, notwithſtanding his degree was but a Senatour: yet in ſeruice of his houſe, and behauiour of his perſon, he was after ye manner of an Emperour. In the dayes of the empire of Pertinax, Albinius was ſente as captaine and gouernour vnto greate Britaine: in whiche gouernement hee was very well loued, and no leſſe feared: for by his greate iuſtice he was feared and with his greate liberalitie he was beloued. When Seuerus departed vnto Aſia, to warre with Peſſenius, vnderſtandinge how renouned the name of Albinius was throughout all the worlde, and howe well liked of the Romaine Empire: hee greatly doubted to aduaunce him ſelfe with the Romane Empire: and the rather, for that he perceiued the principall Romanes, to fixe their eyes vpon Albinius. Seuerus aduiſed him ſelfe to vſe a certaine cautele with Albinius, which was: before he departed frō 
                  Rome, to write vnto him into Britaine, aduertiſing him, that he would

haue his felowſhip in the Empire, from thence forth intituling him Auguſtus: &amp; ſince his departing to ye warrs of Aſia, requeſting him to take the charge of the gouernement of the common wealth. With theſe and ſuche like wordes whiche hee ſente him, and with a letter written vnto him, and certaine iuells whiche hee gaue him, Albinius did endure to be deceiued, though voide of all miſſtruſt to be deceiued.
               
                  Albinius had with him an auncient knight named Cypro Albo, who (as it is reported) ſaide vnto Albinius: thou art not ſo neare a kinſeman, either ſo deare a friende vnto Seuerus, that without thy requeſt, hee will with thee diuide the Empire: for that truely, euen betwixt the father and the ſonne, it were verie muche: but that I thinke hee will nowe be aſſured of thee, to the ende when hee returneth from the warres to deſtroy thee: becauſe from a man ſo noble as Seuerus is, ſo amorous letters, and iuells ſo precious, may not proceede, but wrapt in malice. Albinius woulde giue no credit vnto Cypro Albo, but openly did reade his letters, and ſhewed his iuells: whiche when Seuerus vnderſtoode, hee receiued greate pleaſure thereof: and the better to finiſhe his guile, hee made money in both their names, placing Albinius his picture in the Senate. The minde of Albinius being wonne and obtained, to the ende to holde ſafe and ſure the kingdomes of Europa, hee departed into Aſia: and ſundry times did write vnto Albinius, and not vnto the Senate: giuing accompt of yt whiche hee had donne, and demaundinge counſell in that whiche hee mente to do.
               Fifteene monethes Seuerus ſtayed in the warres with Peſſenius: whome, after hee had ouercome and ſlaine, he determined to deſtroy Albinius: and becauſe hee had no occaſion, either greate or ſmall to make him publike warre, hee aduiſed to kill him by guile. Many Senatours and noble Romanes did write him letters, and alſo perſuaded Albinius in woordes, that hee ſhoulde aduaunce

him ſelfe with the Empire: and to the ſame ende, they did ſweare and affirme vnto him, that although Seuerus were farre from his countrie, yet without compariſon, hee was muche more diſtante from their willes. The caſe was thus, the warres of Aſia béeing finiſhed, Seuerus in greate ſecrecie conferred with certaine Purſeuantes by whome hee was accuſtomed to write letters: whome he commaunded to departe vnto greate Britaine, and to preſente their letters openlye vnto Albinius: and further, to giue him to vnderſtande, howe they had ſecretly to ſay vnto him: and that: if with them hee ſhoulde ſeperate him ſelfe, preſently to kill him: promiſing them, that if they perfourmed that enterpriſe, hee ſhould make them the greateſt men of Rome. Hee gaue them alſo a boxe of fine poyſon, &amp; therewt this inſtruction, that if they might not by chaūce diſpatch &amp; kil Albinius, by ſuch meane: they ſhoulde trauell in ſome meate to giue him of that poyſon.

                  mewhat ſuſpicious of Seuerus, partely for that ſo rarely hee did write vnto him, and alſo becauſe hee was aduertiſed, that in ſecrete hee vſed euill ſpeach of him: wherefore he liued more warely, not onely with ſuche as hee had talke, but alſo of his meate whiche hee ſhoulde eate. Theſe Purſeuaunts béeing arriued in greate Britaine, deliuered their letters openly vnto Albinius, ſaying, that they had to tell him in ſecret, and being nowe in doubt and ſuſpicion of Seuerus his matters, he commaunded theſe Purſeuauntes to be taken, and grieuouſly tormented: which preſently confeſſed, that Seuerus ſente them, for none other purpoſe, but either wt yron or with poyſon to take away the life of Albinius.
               
               Preſently Seuerus was aduertiſed, yt 
                  Albinius had taken, tormented, and put to death his Purſeuantes: where vppon followed, that the one did publiſhe the other open enimies: and for ſuche they exclaymed them ſelues in woordes, defied in letters, and alſo vttered in workes.
               
                  
                  Seuerus had greate ſorrowe, for that Albinius had manifeſted him ſelfe his enimie: and the greater was his griefe, for that his enimies made common reporte, that he would haue ſlaine Albinius as a cowarde, and not deale with him openly as a man of a valiant minde. Seuerus alſo had greate griefe, of the generall reporte of Albinius boaſte, before all men that woulde heare the ſame: of the greate numbers of people and armies of men that did obey him in greate Britaine: and muche more, that did loue and wiſh him in Rome. Seuerus not able to endure with patience, the reports that ranne of Albinius, aduiſed to aſſemble his armies, vnto whome hee did ſpeake after this manner.

                     〈◊〉
                   Albinius.
               IT were not iuſte, that any prince ſhoulde be noted vnſtable, if by chaunce they be ſeene to abhorre at one time, that which they did loue at an other time: for that ſubiects changing their cuſtōes, it is not much that Lordes alter their opinions. As much as a friend ſhalbe vertuous, ſo muche and no more, he ſhall be loued of his friendes: for if it be a thing commendable to loue the good, it is no leſſe vituperable to loue the euill. Admitting that princes deale hardly with ſome, and fauour others, neither for the one are they to be praiſed, either blamed for the other: becauſe rewarde, or puniſhmente, is neither giuen or ought to be giuen conformable vnto princes wills: but agreeable vnto the ſubiects merite. Ye all vnderſtand, how

Albinius and I, beeing young men, were bred in the houſe of the good Emperour Marcus Aurelius: and truly, vnto this day, I haue intreated him, not as a companion, but as a brother: which ſeemeth no leſſe true, for that I parted with him the Empire, which ſildome is diuided betwixt the father and the ſonne. I did not onely deale with him as with a brother, and with him did parte the Empire: but alſo at my iourney vnto the warres of Aſia, vnto him onely I recō
                  mended the gouernement of the common wealth: reſpecting the poſſeſſion which I had of him, and the confidence which I committed vnto him, when I did truſt him with the cōmō wealth: I would haue parted my ſoule with him, if it had benepartible. Being (as I was) wounded in the warres of Aſia, and he placed in the gouernement of great Britaine: notwithſtanding the diſtance that was betwixt them, there paſſed fewe monethes wherein I did not write vnto him, giuing large accōpt of that which was done, and hideing nothinge of all that I determined to do: In ſuche wiſe, that in him was regiſtred al my triumphs, and he was the hoorde of al my profound ſecreats. Betwixt me &amp; Albinius, there was neuer any thing yt was not common, in my houſe there was neuer doore ſhut againſt him, the letters which he wrote I did with greate ioy reade, that which he requeſted me I alwayes perfourmed, whereof he warned me I euer corrected: finally, he neuer deſired any thing of me, that he obtayned not: and neuer had trauell, but I was preſent, and preſt to ſuccour him. After all theſe things, his ſorrowfull deſtinies woulde, and no leſſe hath my fortune without al felicitie perfourmed, that our friendſhip is turned to enimitie, our felicitie vnto treaſon, our benefits

to ingratitude, our loue vnto hatred, our communion to diuorce, our confidence to ſuſpicion, in ſuch wiſe, that at this day there is nothing ſpoken more commonly throughout the Romane Empire, but of the greate friendſhip whiche wee haue had, and the cruell enimitie whiche nowe we haue. That Albinius deſireth to be Lorde, and procureth to be Emperour, I neither wonder, either is it to be marueled: but that which maketh me amaſed, is, that I placeing him with confidence in gouernement of the common wealth, he ſhuld procure to riſe or rebell with Rome: that ſpeaking according to the lawe of a good man, yt if Albinius had thought to attempte ſo foule a dede, if I had requeſted him to take the charge, he ought not to haue cōſented: for there is not the like traitour in this world, as he to whom I cōmitted my houſe, to robbe me of mine honour, and ſpoile mee of my goods. A greater faulte in leſſe magiſtrates hath Albinius committed thē Peſſenius Niger: for that Peſſenius from the time that I was elected Emperour, preſently manifeſted him ſelfe mine enimie: &amp; more, yt I neuer helde him as my friende, either did he accepte me as his Lord: and to ſay that which I had thought neuer to haue ſaide, Peſſenius Niger did write vnto vs, that if wee would perpetuate the principalitie of Aſia vnto him, he woulde vtterly yealde vnto vs all obedience: and for that we would not graunt it him, ſpeaking without paſſion, although he had no reaſon to rebell, he had occaſion to be offended. The matter hath not ſo paſſed betwixt Albinius and me, but that without his owne ſute, or any other mannes for him, beſides the gouernement of Britaine, I gaue him the principalitie of al Europe, ſent him the enſigne of the

Empire, commaunded him by proclamation to be intituled Auguſtus. &amp; yt which is not ſmally to be eſtemed, I cauſed with his image &amp; mine, money to be grauen, and with mine owne proper handes I placed his ſtatuie or picture in the Senate. In repaimente of theſe ſo notable benefites, he hath committed an hundreth thouſand inſolences, namely, hee hath mutined the armies, altered and offended the people, robbed our treaſures, taken our caſtels, eſcandalized me with the Romanes, and nowe of late hath ſlaine my Purſeuaunts: and that whiche grieueth me moſte, is, that he made them ſay in their tormentes, that which neuer was in my thought. I hauing ſlaine the prince Peſſenius, and beeing (as I was) triumphant of the fielde, no man hath to beleeue that I haue ſo ſmall eſtimation of my honour, that he beeing my detected enimie, ſhoulde be ſlaine in ſecrete at my commaundemente.
               In what heart may it be conceiued, that I hauinge (as I haue) armies of ſo greate power and dexteritie, here in my preſence, ſhoulde procure to kill him with poyſon. For to haue ſlaine Albinius by treaſon, it had beene blame to me, and ſhame vnto you, but to him glory: for as his name is renowned, and his fame ſpread throughout the Empire, his perſon to haue beene ſo inuincible, that wee durſt not giue him battell as an enimie, but murther him as traytours.
               The Godds neuer conſent, neither my venturous deſtinies permit, that the ſlaunderous renowne of a traytour, whiche hee hath recouered with his euill life, ſhoulde cleaue vnto mee by his ſecreate deathe: for that (to conclude) I had rather

holde him as an enimie all the dayes of my life, then to fixe any ſcruple in my fame. Albinius did ſweare by the ſimulachre of Diana, not once, but thrice: not with one hande, but with both handes: not in one temple, but in many: for euer more to holde the gods in greate veneration, the people in iuſtice, the temples in reuerence, and to me obedience: all which the periured Albinius hath broken, and neither hath feare or ſhame for that which he hath done: but I hope in the Gods, it ſhal not come to paſſe as he thinketh, that is, to die with poyſon: but the time ſhall come, that hee ſhall pay in the fielde, that which he hath ſworne in ye temple. If this infamous deede had bene done againſt any particular perſon, they ſhould both heare and ſee throughout the world, the amends that I would take thereof: but in as muche as it toucheth none but my ſelfe, who at this preſent am had in ſuſpicion, Albinius being held as innocente, it ſufficeth that it is not in me, but to aduertiſe you thereof: and to you it appertaineth to reuenge the ſame. In ye warres againſt Peſſenius Niger, ye folowed me: in this againſt Albinius, I will folow you: and I hope in the immortall Gods, that they wil giue you the victorie: and in my behalfe on Albinius wil take vengeance.
            
            
               CHAP. XI. Howe Seuerus departed from Aſia to Fraunce, and fought with Albinius and ſlewe him.
               
                  AT the inſtante that Seuerus had finiſhed his ſpeach, all the army exclaming with lowde voyces, againe confirming Seuerus in the Empire, manifeſted Albinius an enimie vnto the Romaine Empire. And for as much as none that was preſent, vnderſtoode the treaſon that Seuerus had attempted againſt Albinius, they gaue him credite in all that he ſaide: &amp; ſo in generall they conceiued as greate hatred againſt the one, as loue vnto the other: proceeding no leſſe by the preſence of Seuerus, then by the abſence of Albinius: for (according to the olde prouerbe) the abſent is neuer without blame, nor the preſent without excuſe. When Seuerus ſawe that he had wonne ye hearts of his armies, hee recouered newe hope to be reuenged of Albinius: and to the purpoſe he made a generall muſter of his men of warre, and founde tenne thouſande horſemen, and xl. thouſand foote men: all whiche he preſently payde, not onely that whiche he did owe them: but alſo gaue them many and greate rewardes, adding therevnto many faire promiſes.
The firſt iourney that Seuerus made, was to beſiege Bizantio (for thither the captaines repaired that had eſcaped the mortall battaile of Peſſenius Niger) and in the ende tooke it, not by force, but by hunger: and hauing the citie vnder his power, he diſplaced the bulworkes, made plaine the towers, ouerthrewe the Theaters, ſubuerted their bathes, burnt their houſes, ſtrangled the ſtraungers, &amp; the natiues he did captiuate: finally, he behaued him ſelfe not as a Romane prince, but as a moſte cruel tyrant.
               
               
                  With the riches that hee recouered in Bizantio, and the aboundance whiche he robbed in other partes, he commaunded the cities to be repaired, that Peſſenius ſouldiours had ſackt: and charged the fortes to be erected that they had throwne downe: and leauing officers neceſſarie for gouernement, and men of warre to defende thoſe countries, he departed with greate celeritie vnto greate Britaine, with a determined intente to make furious warres againſt Albinius.
                  
               
               
                  
                  His deſire was ſo diſordinate to encounter with Albinius, that he traueled night and day, thicke and thinne, foule and faire: and that wherefore they moſt blamed him, was, that he neither obſerued the ſolemne feſtiuall dayes, or had compaſſion of the tyred. Traueling on thoſe wayes when it ſnowed, manie times hee was bare headed: and in the mire, hee woulde trauell one foote: when it rained, hee woulde marche in his doublet and hoſe: and wanting victualles, he woulde eate bareley bread: and (as he after reported) to be reuenged of his enimie, he thought it all well imployed. Hee ſent before him valiant captaines, and men very light &amp; of greate ſwiftneſſe, to cleare the wayes vpon the highte of the mountaines, and to defende the moſt perilous places: chiefly when he paſſed the Alpes of Italie, doubting that Albinius might haue in that place ſome hidden ambuſhe. Nowe, when Seuerus ſawe him ſelfe and all his armies in Gallia Tranſalpina, and that in ſo longe a iourney hee had incountered with no ſtumbling blocke: if vntill that time he went with hope, from thence foorth he marched in certeintie to obtaine victorie: for the feare whiche he had, was, that his armie trauelinge both weary and ſpent, Albinius at the ſouden might diſcouer to giue him battell. In al this time Albinius remained in the Iſle of Britane, which nowe is Englande: but preſently after hee vnderſtoode that Seuerus had paſſed ye Alpes, he brought foorth all his armie out of ye Iſle, &amp; ſente them into Fraunce, rather to defende the frontiers, then without any commaundement to make warre: becauſe Seuerus was ſo ſouden in his arriuall, ye he was then in Fraunce, whē they belieued him not to be departed from Italie. With great ſpeede Albinius did write vnto the cities adioyning, requeſting their helpe for money, and commaunding them to be ſtronge and valiant in his ſeruice, of whom manie diſobeyed, and other rebelled againſt him: notwithſtanding, they all confeſſed, that they rather did it for feare of the potencie of Seuerus, then for the hatred whiche they did beare vnto Albinius. But in the ende,

the two armies beeing ioyned, and all the cities diuided into parcialities, euery day betwixt them there was incounters, and daily meetings to ſkirmiſhe: and for the moſte parte, the ſouldiours of Seuerus departed with broken heades, and Albinius his bandes returned victorious.
               
               
                  They trauerſed on a certaine day ſo furious a ſkirmiſh, that it was neceſſarie Seuerus ſhoulde come foorth armed vnto the ſame: and as hee was not able to make his ſouldiours to retire, neither conſtraine his enimies to flie, thinking to enter to haue parted the fray, hee was vrged to fight in his owne perſon: in whiche fight he receiued ſo greate a blowe with a plummette of leade, that hee was feld downe to the grounde, and lay for deade ſo longe ſpace, that many did kiſſe the handes of his ſonne Geta, as Emperour. After Seuerus had eſcaped that daunger, and was cured of his wounde, in greate ſecrecie he called into his preſence certaine Sorcerers and Inchanters that hee brought with him, both requeſting, threatening, and promiſing them manie thinges, if they woulde tell him the ende of thoſe warres: for if hee ſhoulde be conquerour, hee woulde proſecute the ſame: and if hee ſhoulde be ouercome, he woulde returne into Italie. The Sorcerers and Inchaunters anſwered, that his armie ſhould receiue greate hurte, but in the ende his enimie Albinius ſhoulde be ouercome: and that hee ſhoulde not obtaine in this caſe, that which he deſired, that is to ſay, to kill Albinius with his owne handes: but that hee ſhoulde ſée him deade before his eyes. The tenth of March, Seuerus receiued this anſwere of his Inchanters, and preſently on the next day, he tooke muſter of all his men, commaundinge them to ſhooe their horſe, and amend their armour: and the third day hee gaue battell vnto Albinius, neare to a citie named Lugduno, whiche nowe in Fraunce is called Lions Sonarona, whiche on bothe ſides was ſo extremely contended, that a greate parte of the day it might not be knowne, vnto whome the victorie would incline.
               
               
                  
                  When al the day was paſſed, and darke within night, the one army fighting with the other, in the ende Albinius was ouercome. This battaile was ſo bloudie, that of ſo greate a number of people, as both the hoaſtes did conteine, there eſcaped not a man, that was not ſlaine in the fielde, or returned vnto his tente vnwounded. Albinius remained to keepe the citie, and ſent his capteines to giue battaile, who beeing beaten out of the fielde, the Seuerians entred into the citie, ſpoyling goodes, burning houſes, and ſlaying people. Seuerus had a captaine named Letus, whiche was the cauſe of the conqueſt of that battell: for yt 
                     Seuerus his ſouldiours beeing in a manner ouercome, and Seuerus ready and preſt to flie, he relieued the battell with a freſh bande of ſouldiours: Letus of ſkill and induſtrie woulde not fight that day, vntil he ſawe Seuerus fledde, and alſo fall from his horſe: thinking, that if Seuerus ſhoulde die or be ſlaine, and hee ouercomminge and conquering the battell, to aduaunce him ſelfe with the Romaine Empire. Seuerus was not ignorant of the good ſeruice whiche his captaine had done him at that inſtant, either did he hide the intente wherewith he perfourmed the ſame: for whiche cauſe the warres beeing finiſhed, he commaunded his heade to be cut off: not for that whiche hee did, but for that which he woulde haue done.
               
               
                  When the Seuerians deſtroyed the citie of Lugduno, amongſt the reſte they ſlewe the ſorrowfull Albinius, who ſo ſlaine they brought vnto Seuerus, commaunding to cutte off his heade, and to diſmember and mangle his bodie all to pieces: whiche beeing done, he riding vpon a rough horſe, all to trampled the body of Albinius, whiche was hackt and hewed to mamocks. All men that behelde Seuerus vſe ſo greate inhumanitie with the body of Albinius, wepte: and all men that hearde the reporte thereof, were eſcandalized, and not without greate reaſon, for The office of a prince of moſte perfecte pietie, is, to pardon the liuinge, and to bury the deade.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     Seuerus treading and trampling the bodie of Albinius (after the maner of a fierce Lion) his horſe grewe fearefull, and gaue him ſo ſhrewde a fall againſt the grounde, that he remained a great ſpace aſtonnied and in diſmay, in ſuch wiſe, that he miſſed verie narrowly, preſently to haue paide with life, ſo enorme an iniurie. Theſe matters being finiſhed, Seuerus diſpatched his Purſeuaunts into all partes, with the newes of this victorie: and the head of Albinius vnto Rome, and his bodie, as it was all to pieces troaden, trampled and drawen, he commaunded to be throwen into the riuer Rhodanus, to the ende that as he had taken away his life, ſo by no meanes any memorie ſhould remaine of Albinius
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. XII. ¶Howe after the death of Albinius, Seuerus returned to Rome, and there ſlewe many.
               
                  
                     SEuerus not ſatiſfied with ſlaying his enimie Albinius, treading his bodie vnder his horſſe féete, caſting the pieces thereof into the riuer Rhodanus, and ſending his head vnto Rome to be ſet in the pillorie: but commaunded ſerch to be made for the bodies of all the noble Romans, which had béene ſlaine in the ſeruice of Albinius: and for that he might not chaſtice them in time of their life, he aduiſed to vituperate and defile them after their death, cauſing their bodies to be drawen, cut in pieces, and burnte: ſome throwen into riuers, to the ende they ſhould neuer more appeare: and otherſome vnto beaſtes to be deuoured. In all cities that receiued, obeyed, or ſuccoured Albinius or his ſouldiours, Seuerus did greate hurte, robbing their goods, and puniſhing their perſons. Manie cities and people made their excuſe, ſaying, they had not ſerued or followed Albinius, for that they had a deſire ſo to do: but becauſe they were not ſuccoured of Seuerus, and yet ceaſed

not to chaſtice and robbe them. Albinius had thrée ſonnes, a daughter, and a wife, generous in bloud and beautifull of face, whoſe throte with his children he commaunded to be cutt, and their bodies alſo to be caſt into the riuer Rhodanus. And as Albinius was of greate power in all the Empire of Europe, and of him ſelf verie gratious, liberal, valiant, and noble minded: ſo in a manner all the nobles of Spaine and Fraunce, had followed his parte alike: the throtes of all which, Seuerus (after the battaile) cōmaunded to be cutt: and though he ſlewe the fathers, yet he did not therefore pardon the wife and children. Albinius his wife and his children being ſlaine, and execution done vpon all perſons that followed his opinion: Seuerus applyed all their goods and riches, for his owne chamber, which were ſo great, and of ſuch value, that it was doubted whether any Emperour had euer attained vnto the like. The prouinces of Spaine and Fraunce being ordered, and two gouernours placed in greate Britaine, Seuerus departed vnto Rome, and led with him all his armie: not for that, in all Italie he had any enimie bent againſt him, but to terrifie the common wealth of Rome. Seuerus of his owne naturall inclination was ſo quarelous, proude, vnquiet, bloudie, and doubtfull, that although he had peace, yet he woulde goe alwayes after the faſhion of a warriour. Seuerus was receiued with greate ioye of the Romanes, although moſt certeinly many of them ſtoode in greate feare, for that they had wiſhed that Albinius might haue preuailed, whereof Seuerus had certeine intelligence: whoſe condition was ſo harde, that to giue a cruell chaſticement, a ſmall occaſion was ſufficient. After that he had viſited the great temple of Iupiter, he diuided amongſt the capteines that followed in the warres, many iewels and greate riches: and further, gaue them certeine liberties, which is to wéete, that they might wear rings of golde vpon their fingers, and entertaine Courtiſans within their houſes. It was no ſmall griefe vnto the Romanes, that Seuerus had giuen ſuch liberties vnto his men of warre: ſaying, that from thenceforth for euer to

weare ringes of golde, they woulde ſpende their owne, &amp; robbe others: and to vſe concubines in their houſes, would cauſe diſſention amongeſt the people, and alſo debilitate their perſons. In Rome there was a Conſul named Claudius, which had his picture placed in the Senate, &amp; was praiſed before all the people with a publique Oration for his worthie actes done in Aſia: whereof Seuerus tooke greate deſpight, becauſe this Claudius was kinſman vnto Albinius. Seuerus did not knowe how to be reuenged of the Senate, but publiquely by proclamation, commaunded (vpon paine of death) that al men ſhould call Commodus a God: for confirmation whereof, he did not only place his picture in the Senate, to the end they ſhould reuerence him, but alſo in the temples to be adored. To commaund the Romanes to adore &amp; reuerence Commodus, as one of the Gods, being (as he was) the woorſt of all men, it was vnto them ſo grieuous to heare, &amp; ſo harde to perfourme, yt they determined, not to go to the church, either to offer ſacrifice vnto their Gods: becauſe no parte thereof ſhould be allotted vnto the God Commodus. Seuerus vppon a daye went vnto the Senate, &amp; made there a long and truculent Oration, wherin, after he had ſpoken many threateninge &amp; malicious woords, he commaunded certeine letters to be read, which he found amongſt Albinius writings, made by many Conſuls, Senatours, &amp; other gentlemen amongſt ye people, vnto Albinius, offering him their perſons, ſending their goods, &amp; that he ſhould not be diſmaid in thoſe warrs: for that in the common wealth he was much deſired. The reading of theſe letters being ended, he commaunded them preſently to be torne: &amp; for the time did diſſemble the matter, or to ſay better, did deferre the chaſtiſemēt: for yt after wardes, as well of ſuch as were abſent, as of them yt were preſent, he tooke ſo great reuengement, yt as ye ſtréets were bathed in bloud, ye fields filled wt carcaſes, ye wayes ſcattered with quarters, &amp; the pillories beſet with heades: they ſaide in Rome, ye 
                     Silla was reuiued, &amp; Nero was not dead. Seuerus made a memoriall of all the riche men, valiant, &amp;

of power, that were in all the Empire: the greater parte whereof he charged to haue béene the ſeruauntes, friends or fauourers of Iulianus, of Niger, or elſe of Albinius, his mortall enimies: for which cauſe, of frée men, he made them ſlaues: of lordes, ſeruauntes: of riche, poore: and alſo of liuing, dead men: in ſuch wiſe, that he ſlewe many, not for offences which they had committed, but to rob them of their goods, which they had gathered togeather. Seuerus ſlewe ſome, with ſome reaſon, &amp; others vpon ſmal occaſion: but all theſe which followe, he killed without all reaſon or occaſion: that is to ſay, Munius, Sellius, Claudius, Bitalius, Papianius, Elius, Iulius, Lolius, Aurelius, Antoninus, Poſthumius, Sergius, Fabius, Nenius, Amuſsius, Caſperius, Seyonius, Sulpitianus, Coceyus, Eructus, Aſsilonius, Claudius, Honoratus, Petronius, Peſſenius, Ceſtus, Aurelianus, Materius, Iulianus, Albinius, Cerelius, Fauſtinianus, Herenius, Valerius, Nobius, Arabianus, Marcus, Fabatus. Theſe men were glorious, both of bloud &amp; alſo for noble déedes &amp; riches: for they were either Conſuls, Cenſors, Pretors, Senatours, Ediles, Tribunes, or capteines: whoſe goods he imployed not vnto the publique treaſurie, but did incorporate vnto his patrimonie, for him ſelfe to inioy the dayes of his own life, &amp; to leaue vnto his children after his death. Seuerus defamed Cincius an auncient Conſul, affirming, that he had procured poyſon to kill him, wherfore he commaunded him to be ſlaine: but the trueth being knowen as Seuerus afterward reported, but ye 
                     Cincius did much delight to goe on hunting, &amp; had a fine yeark to kill the Bore &amp; other venerie in the mountaines. He commaunded alſo Narciſſus to be caſt vnto ye Lyons, who at the requeſt of Martia choked Commodus: it was nothing to commaund them to be ſlaine, but yt with his owne eyes he would behold them executed, which was wont to be ſo ſtraunge vnto Romaine princes, that they neuer vſed to ſée any perſon put to deth, neither ſo much as in the citie to be reſident: but they vſed, if any ſuffered, to ride or go foorth on hunting.

               AFter that Seuerus had conquered and ſlaine thrée Emperours, that is to ſaye, Iulianus in Rome, Niger in Aſia, and Albinius in Fraunce: it ſéemed vnto him, that ſince he had chaſticed and triumphed ouer the Romans, he ought alſo to make his name glorious amongeſt the Barbarians: becauſe all the warres that he helde vnto that daye, were more to make him ſelfe Lorde of the common wealth, then to magnifie his name. Seuerus aduiſed him ſelfe to go in his owne perſon to make warres with the Parthians, the occaſion of which enterpriſe was: for that the king of Atrenoes had fauoured ye parcialitie of Niger, but had deferred the reuengement thereof, to make conqueſt of Albinius being in great Britain. If Seuerus in this caſe had taken the opinion of the people, either the counſell of the Senate, he woulde neither haue taken thoſe warres in hande, or made accompt of the iniurie: becauſe at that time, thoſe kingdomes were neither friendes or foes with Rome. And as the Romans were fatigated &amp; tyred with warres, ſo they were contented (for the time) to ceaſſe the recouering of them for their vaſſals, to obtein them for quiet enimies. Seuerus departed vnto Aſia, and in the way would firſt take the kingdōe of ye higher Armenia, whereof the king of Armenia being aduertiſed, and that he came with an armie of ſo greate power, and ſo determined to take his kingdome, met him vppon the way, not armed as a man of warre, but clad with the garments of peace: his truce being ſet downe with Seuerus, preſently he gaue him much money, and offered to ſende him ſuccour: for the accompliſhment wherof, he deliuered vnto Seuerus his two ſonnes in pledge: Seuerus did not onely confirme him in his kingdome, but alſo tooke him

vnder his protection. The affaires of Armenia being diſpatched, Seuerus departed towardes the kingdom of Hoſdroenos, whoſe king was named Anguaro, bothe crooked and ſame, but yet no foole: for he had ſuch ſkill to recouer the good will of Seuerus, that he neither admitted him as a vaſſall, tooke no money, demaunded no hoſtages, or did his countrie hurt, but receiued him to his familiar friendſhip, and made him a confederate with the people of Rome. Hauing paſſed the kingdome of Hoſdroenos, Seuerus entred the landes and countries of Albanos, and being then the moneth of April, and ſpring time, he founde the fieldes full of flowers and graſſe, and commaunded his horſſes for the ſpace of fiftéen dayes to be fedde, and his armie to be recreated and refreſhed: becauſe his horſſes were
growen leane, and his men tyred. Seuerus beeing departed from the fieldes of Albanos, entred the countrie of Arabia Felix, where they found that, which they found not in all the kingdomes of the worlde: namely, the trées that hare the precious Aromatike ſpices, and the boughes whereof they gathered the moſt fine and excellent baulme. Seuerus ſacked all the townes of Arabia Felix, cut downe their fieldes, ſpoyled and oppreſſed all people, and as he afterwardes ſaide, he would not haue entred therein: for that being (as it was) ſo riche, ſo ioyfull, pleaſant, and delectable: but becauſe he found him ſelfe in greate cumber, to withdrawe his ſouldiours from thence: for that they felt them ſelues more delighted with the vices of Arabia, then with the hazardes and daungers of the warres. Hauing paſſed the delectable countrie of Arabia Felix, Seuerus entred the countrie and kingdom of Athrabanos, againſt whoſe king principally he made that iourney.
                  Athras was a great citie, ſituated vpon the top of a moſt high hill, and chiefeſt citie of all the kingdome: and for that cauſe was named the kingdome of Athrabanos. Seuerus went preſently to the ſiege thereof: but as the king had incloſed him ſelfe therein, with great readineſſe and prouiſion, the wall being ſtrong, the citie rockye, the people

warrelike, and furniſhed with munition and victuals: ſmall was the hurte that Seuerus did vnto them within, but which the Romans receiued was very greate. And as Seuerus gaue foorth no other bruite, when he came from Rome, but to be reuenged of the Athrabanos, he perfourmed that warre ſo exactly, that there was no daye but he battered the citie of Athras, and occupied his warlike engins, deuiſed and practiſed all manner fights and offences, that might be againſt the enimie, and the moſte notified Romans, that there did not notifie them ſelues: but in the ende, might neither take the ſame, either as much as a capteine, or ouerthrow one windowe.
Thoſe that were beſieged within that citie, to ieſt with their enimies, tyed very ſubtily, little earthen pottes, vnto a kinde of byrdes like vnto Crowes, which flying ouer the armies of Seuerus, let fall their pottes vpon their pates: by which ieſt many had their heades broken: but much more were the Romans deſpighted, to conſider howe little they did eſtéeme them, not fighting with them in armour, but with pottes, and tankardes. The ayre of that mountaine was verie ſubtile, the waters verie thinne, fruites in great aboundaunce, and the Sunne verie hoat, and the grounde ſomewhat moyſt: by which occaſion Seuerus his whole campe fell into the diſeaſe of the fluxe, and there died amongeſt the reſt ſeuen notable capteines, two of Seuerus couſins, and a little baſtarde ſonne, which all men likewiſe thought to be his couſin: but by his greate ſorrowe &amp; teares, he diſcouered the childe to be of his owne proper fleſhe.
               
               
                  Seuerus conſidering the citie of Athras to be inexpugnable, the people therein inuincible, and his campe alſo weakened through greate ſickeneſſe, aduiſed to rayſe his ſiege, before his armie were vtterly loſt, which he did, not without greate griefe, and no leſſe deſpight, being as he was, giuen vnto ſo many triumphes, and victories, he thought him ſelf vāquiſhed, ſince he might not ouercome: but fortune yt naturally diſcouereth her ſelf to be variable,

the victorie which ſhée denied Seuerus in fighting, ſhée in his flight gaue afterwardes more largely. The caſe was thus: that ſailing on the Sea with all his armie, it was his chaunce to encounter with a tempeſt, and being forced to followe the diſpoſition of the weather, and not as his heart deſired, they brought him to riuers of the kingdome of Parthia, not thrée leagues diſtant from the greate citie of Teſiphont, where the king was further entred into feaſting, then compaſſed with armour. Seuerus entred into the fielde of Teſiphont, committing ſo greate ſpoiles and robberies, that he put the people into greate feare, which as Seuerus did take at the ſoudeine and vnwares, and being amazed, neither able to ſaye or aunſwere, if they were demaunded: for that to flye they had no time, and to reſiſt they had no force: &amp; that whiche was woorſt of all, to make agréement, it was not in their handes: neither might they endure to ſubmitt themſelues vnto the Romans. Seuerus arriuing at Teſiphont did ſubuert it vnto the ground, ſlewe al that made reſiſtance, and did captiuate man, woman, and childe: he tooke al the treaſure and riches, bothe of the citie and royall palace: finally all the countrie, treaſure, goods and perſons came to the handes of Seuerus, except the king Arthabanus, who
eſcaped on horſebacke. Seuerus led with him certeine ſkilfull painters, which as he went traueiling, they went drawing and painting, all cities, caſtels, riuers, mountaines, nations, kingdomes, and prouinces, by &amp; throughe which he paſſed: and all the battels and victories whiche he had made and obteined.
                  Seuerus ſent a greate Ambaſſage vnto the Senate and people of Rome, with whome he ſent many captiues, much riches, and the tables wherin his victories were ſet out at large: the Romains gaue greate thankes vnto the Gods, and alſo greate praiſes vnto Seuerus: although moſte true, that all men were pleaſed with the victories, but would not, that they ſhoulde haue béene obteined by Seuerus.
                  Departing from the kingdome of Parthia, he diuided amongeſt his armies all

that he had taken from the Parthians: and for himſelfe reſerued nothing but that which he ſent vnto the Senat, and a ring of Vnicorne, a white parat or popingay, and a gréen horſe: the which thinges he toke not for their value, but forthe ſtraungnes of their colours. Seuerus came through the kingdome of Paleſtina, and gaue them many lawes conformable vnto the lawes of the Romanes: commaunding vppon paine of death, that none ſhould name himſelfe a Iew, either call himſelfe a Chriſtian, or obſerue the lawe
of Chriſtians. From Paleſtina he came through Aſſyria, vnto the citie of Alexandria, where alſo he placed new cuſtomes, and alſo made newe lawes, which he cauſed them to write and obſerue: howbeit, they endured but the life of Seuerus: for after his death, they did not onely breake them, but alſo burnt the tables wherin they were writen.
            
            
               CHAP. XIIII. ¶ Of Seuerus his ſonnes, and of their euill inclination.
               THe kinges that were enimies being ouercome, new cō
                  federation made with old friends, and all the prouinces of Aſia reformed, he came vnto Rome, and as the Romans had prepared the Parthicke triumph, he might not enter triumphing: for that he came ſo weake of a quartane, and ſo lame of the goute, that he might neither indure the chariott, or ſuffer the intertainement of the people. It had chaunced to none of ye 
                  Romane Empire, as it fortuned vnto Seuerus, that is to ſay, that had ſlaine ſo many princes, &amp; obteyned ſo many victories, and yet neuer entered triumphing into Rome: which was not for his demerits, or repugnancie of the Romanes: but for his thrée firſt victories he might not triumphe, becauſe they were Romane princes, and to his other victories of Aſia his diſeaſe gaue impediment.
               
                  Seuerus had two legitimate ſonnes, ye elder was named

                  Baſſianus, the other Geta, who notwithſtanding they were brothers in bloud, yet were they much different in conditions, which infirmitie was not onely manifeſted in their infancie: for that in their childiſh playes they could neuer
agrée, either in weightie affaires yeld one conſent. It was much noted amongeſt the Romanes, that ye two bretherne being but children, might neuer agrée in their childiſhe playes and deuiſes, that is to ſay, in making houſes of clay, running at baſe, driuing topps, meating ſtrawes, trilling the bowle, ſtriking the drumme, and other ſuch like childiſhe trifles. That the one delighted, the other lothed: that which the elder affirmed, the younger denied: and if it happened their tutours to commaund them to play together, if the one did winne, and the other looſe, they tare their haire, ſcratched their faces, whirled ſtones, ſtrucke with their fiſtes, in ſuch wiſe, that as from their téeth and face they drue bloud, and rent off their lockes, ſo they ſéemed rather to kill eche other as enimies, then to ieſt as brethren.
               
               It was no ſmall griefe vnto Seuerus, when hée vnderſtoode of the euil condition of his ſonnes, and that alwayes they were diuided amongeſt themſelues, who trauelled (by al meanes poſſible) to bring them to conformitie, which he might neuer (by any meanes) bring to paſſe, althoughe he requeſted: either would they obey, although hée commaunded: for his ſonnes were ſo wilfull, that they ceaſed not to execute their owne wills, notwithſtanding their fathers gentle ſute, or his extréeme commaundement. Seuerus alſo had a brother named Geta, a perſon of great boloneſſe, and warrlike, who in all warres followed Seuerus, and if Seuerus had hautie thoughtes, truly Geta his thoughtes were not humble: for hée helde it for moſt certaine, that vnto him Seuerus ſhould leaue the Empire. Beſides that Geta was valiaunt and warrlike, ſo was he alſo guilefull and diligent, that is to ſay, in ſeruing Seuerus, contenting the Senate, and pleaſing the people.
               
                  The hatred and brabbling that paſſed betwixte Baſſianus and Geta his couſins, vſually hée reported it vnto all men, in ſuch wyſe, that Geta ſuppoſed to obteine by guile the Empire, that Seuerus had gotten with armes. Seuerus well vnderſtoode, howe Geta wente thus anglinge for the Empire, and therein to take awaye all occaſions, in the fourth yeare of his Empire, going againſt Albinius, at that time in the citie of Millaine, before hée paſſed the Alpes, hee created his elder ſonne Caeſar, and his younger Conſul: whereuppon a certaine Capitaine ſaid vnto Seuerus: it well ſéemeth Seuerus, thou remembreſt not the diſpleaſures that Baſſianus and Geta thy ſonnes haue done thée, either the ſeruice which thy brother Geta hath performed on thy behalfe.
               To this Seuerus aunſweared, it well appeareth that thou ſpeakeſt by heareſaye, rather then by anye experience whiche thou haſt in this caſe: for, as thou haſte no brothers, either haſt béene married to haue any children, no more knoweſt thou, what difference of loue is beetwixte the one and the other: For I giue to vnderſtande, that without all compariſon, wee fathers doe more loue the thwartes of oure children, then the ſeruice of oure brethren.
               The elder brother whiche was named Baſſianus, changed his name, and commaunded all men to call him Antoninus Aurelius, in the memorie of Antoninus Pius, and of Marcus Aurelius: becauſe theſe Princes were verye glorious in their liues, and in their Common wealthes no leſſe beloued.
               
                  When Seuerus returned from the warres of Parthia, his ſonnes Baſſianus and Geta were then men: and for that hee vnderſtoode that the Romanes were thereof then very doubtfull, hée requeſted his ſonnes, that notwithſtandinge the variaunce betwixte themſelues, they woulde bée in peace wyth the people: but héerewith mighte hee not tame the condition of the young men, either perſuade them to be in friendſhippe with the Romanes: for as much

as he ſoldered with his good woords, ſo much did they eſcā
                     dalize with their lewd woorkes. Seuerus finding himſelfe infected with infirmities, compaſſed with enimies, and his ſonnes ſo euill inclined, was alwayes ſad, penſiue, melancholie, and (in a manner) in deſpaire: not onely doubting, they would diminiſh the eſtate wherein he left them, but alſo loſe the honour which they did inherite. Seuerus conſidering the daily complaints made of his ſonnes in the Senate, and the continual diſpleaſures which they gaue him, aduiſed to baniſhe them the vices and pleaſures of Rome: the one hee ſent into Germanie, the other into Panonia: but if they were euil in his preſence, they were much worſe in his abſence: for that aforetime, by their ſubiection, they abſceined from ſome vices, but afterwards with libertie they committed all miſchiefe.
                  The parents that with their owne hands, and in their owne houſes, may not frame vertue in their children, will hardly atteine it at the hands of others: for that vertue is not obteyned in ſeeking ſtraunge countries, but in the amendment of old errours.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XV. ¶Of a fauoured ſeruaunt of Seuerus named Plautianus.
               JN the dayes of the Empire of the good Marcus Aurelius, there came from Africa vnto Rome, a gentlemā named Plautianus, poore, blind in ſight, craftie and ſubtile in condition: and being (as hee was) mutinous and quarelling, and whereſoeuer he went, mouing ſome debate, Marcus Aurelius commaunded him to be baniſhed Rome: for he was a prince of ſuch patience, that he ſuffered not in his common wealth a man that was vitious, or any young mā that was quarellous. Plautianus being baniſhed Rome, departed vnto the garriſons of Illyria: and from thence alſo being caſte as a ſeditious perſon, repaired at laſt, into the company of Seuerus, of whome he was very well handled,

and alſo honoured, and in all thinges placed aboue all men: ſome ſaid that it was done of Seuerus, for that hée was of his countrie: ſome for kindred, and ſome durſt ſay that hée ſerued not onely for martiall affayres, but alſo to do him ſeruice in the chamber. After that Seuerus came to be Emperour, he gaue ſo great credite vnto Plautianus, and ſo ſtrictly did follow his counſell, that he neither read letter, but hée did ſée it, or ſigned commiſſion that hée liked not, either gaue any reward that he craued not. In the Senate, he was placed in the moſt honourable ſeate: when he came forth into Rome, all the Gentlemen did accompanie him: when he came out of his houſe, all Embaſſadours did attend on him: in time of warre, all captaines ſued vnto him: if there were playes and paſtimes, they were alwayes repreſented before his palace: if they had to giue or receiue any money, all did paſſe through his hands: in ſuch wiſe, that it was neuer ſéene in Rome, that any man without the title of an Emperour, enioyed ſo great portion of ye Empire.

                     Plautianus naturally was proud, ambitious, couetous, and cruell: and the more to ſhewe his fierceneſſe, crueltie, &amp; magnificence, he alwayes had a drawne ſword borne before him: and when he paſſed through the ſtreats, hee would that none ſhould dare to behold him in the face, but caſt downe their eyes to the ground: and when hée trauelled vpon the way, he had alwayes one that went before, to giue warning to all perſons to giue way, where he ſhould paſſe: in ſuch wiſe, that hee neither would behold ſtraungers, either be ſéene of the countrie natiues.
               
               
                  Seuerus gaue in reward vnto Plautianus, the goods of al perſons that were condemned and confiſcate in the Empire: and as hée was of a gréedie and couetous nature, ſo they were infinite that he cauſed to be ſlaine in ye Empire: not becauſe they had ſo deſerued, but for their goods which they poſſeſſed.
               The elder ſonne of Seuerus named Baſſianꝰ, being come to ripe vnderſtāding, and perceiuing how al things went, was greatly gréeued, to ſe Plautianus haue ſo great power

in the gouernement of the common wealth: and Plautianus preſently finding ye hatred of Baſſianus, practiſed with Seuerus that Baſſianus ſhould marrie with his only daughter: and incōtinently, the elder ſonne of Seuerus was married vnto the daughter of Plautianus. Plautianus beholding himſelfe not onely the alone fauoured, but alſo father in lawe with Seuerus, it ſéemed vnto him but a trifle to be Lord of the whole world: and moſt truly, Plautianus in heaping honour vpon honour, and eſtate vpon eſtate, bredd his owne deſtruction: for that men neuer ſurfet to eate that which is neceſſarie, but in eating and drinking more then the ſtomache will beare. Though Plautianus daughter was very faire, of good condition, and brought with her a moſt rich dowrie, yet did her huſband Baſſianus, moſt cruelly hate her: which he diſcouered both in woord and déede, affirming her to be the daughter of a baſe and vile perſon, and that hée would one day kill both her and her father: and yet not therewithall ſatiſfied, they did neither ſléepe in one chamber, or dine at one table. Baſſianus aunſweared certaine Romanes that requeſted him to bee friend with his wife, and to honour his father in law: I giue you Romanes to vnderſtand, that I did not marrie, but my father did marrie mée, which I would not haue done if he had cō
                  maunded me, but to defloure the daughter, and enioy the treaſure of her father: and ſince it is done, let her ſéeke an huſband, for I will ſéeke a wife. Plautianus vnderſtanding what his ſonne Baſſianus had ſaid, and that his daughter was not married, but diſhonoured, that Seuerus was old &amp; ſicke, and that Baſſianus held him not as a father in lawe, but as an enimie, determined to reuenge that iniurie: either els to looſe both life and honour in the enterpriſe.
               
                  Baſſianus informed his father Seuerus, of many tyrannies which Plautianus committed in the common wealth, and Plautianus alſo complained howe euill hée vſed his daughter: and thus they went on cōfirming their enimitie, and giuing euery day new paſſions &amp; tedious complaintes vnto Seuerus: but in the end, hée gaue eare vnto the complaints

of Plautianus, as vnto a ſeruaunt: but vnto Baſſiaaus, as vnto a ſonne. Seuerus conſidering the continuall diſpleaſure giuen him by Plautianus, the tyrannies hee executed in the Empire, the enimitie betwixt him and Baſſianus, and that alſo with his great fauour he eſtaéemed him litle, conceiued that ſome day he might riſe with the Empire: wherefore, from thenceforth hée neither ſhewed him good countenaunce, either gaue him ſo great authoritie in the common wealth.
               
                  Plautianus did well perceiue, that he had not onely Baſſianus vnto his enimie, but alſo ſtoode in diſgrace of Seuerus: and thought with himſelfe, that to eſcape beſt cheape, either they would take away his life, or caſt him out of fauour: and to deliuer himſelfe of ſo great an infamie, he determined to kill them, to quite himſelfe.
            
            
               CHAP. XVI. ¶Of a certaine treaſon that Plautianus had ordeined againſt Seuerus, and how it was diſcouered.
               THe order that Plautianus vſed, or to ſay better, the diſorder that he practiſed to kill Seuerus and Baſſianus, procéeded as from a paſſioned tyraunt, and not as a man aduiſed: and ſo it afterwards redounded to his loſſe and deſtruction. The caſe was thus, there was in Rome a Tribune named Saturninus, natiue of Aſſyria, who was the greateſt friend that Plautianus had, with whome hée did moſt communicate, to whom he did moſt commend his ſecretes, and alſo for whom he did moſt pleaſure. Plautianus ſending for this Saturninus an houre within night, and incloſing themſelues within a chamber, ſaid in great ſecrecie theſe wordes following.
               
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           Plautianus his Oration to Saturninus.
                           
                           Saturninus, thou knoweſt how great loue I haue borne thee, and how many good deedes I haue done to thee, &amp; thy houſe: wherof there needeth no other token, but the beholding of thee ſo highly aduaunced in the Court, &amp; ſo accepted in my ſeruice, many with me be offended, &amp; at thee al men haue enuie. Friends, parents, acquaintance, recommended, and ſeruaunts, I had for whome to haue done: vnto ſome of whom I was much beholding, &amp; of others I was to haue cō
                              ſidered for ſeruice: all theſe notwithſtanding, on thee onely I fixed mine eyes, to magnifie thee: and in thee I imployed my hart to loue thee. I ſent now for thee, to recompt vnto thee my trauels and ſorrowes, to the end thou ſhouldeſt helpe to deliuer mee from them: and herein thou ſhalt perceiue, the affectionate loue which I beare thee, in that I repoſe my confidence in thee, wherein I would not truſt mine owne proper ſonne: for ſonnes thincke not, but howe to inherite their fathers goods, but verie friendes haue care to deliuer their friendes from griefe and ſorrowe. Thou well knoweſt, Saturninus, what great ſeruice I haue done to Seuerus, and ſince my youth haue followed him in the warres. I ſay, I ſerued him ſo young, that I alone am his moſt auncient ſeruaunt: although I bee now the moſt forgotten and abhorred. Setting a part all ſeruices which I haue done for him, and all great daungers that I haue paſſed to deliuer him from perill, I haue borne ſo tender affection vnto my Lord Seuerus, that I left to like him as a man, and did adore

him as a God and that this is true, it appeareth moſt cleare, in that I gaue my daughter vnto his ſonne Baſſianus, and my ſelfe to be his perpetuall ſlaue. After I ſpent my youth in his ſeruice, &amp; followed the father throughout the world, his ſonne Baſſianus nouriſhed in my armes from his infancie, I did yeeld him my goods, I gaue him my onely daughter, I gouerned his common wealth in peace, of his euill life I framed in al men an opinion of great vertue, his cruelties and tyrannie I made all men beleeue to be zeale of iuſtice: in ſuch wiſe, that they neuer committed vile deede, that I ſoldered not: either at any time commaunded any difficult matter, that I accompliſhed not. The matter is thus come to paſſe, the Gods permitting, or my ſorrowfull deſtinies procuring, I am fallen into ſo great hatred of Seuerus, and in ſo cruel contempt and enimitie with Baſſianus, that in recompence of al my ſeruice which I haue done them all the dayes of my life, they are nowe determined to take away my life. Thou ſeeſt now, Saturninꝰ, whether it be reaſon that I endure the ſame, whereunto if I ſhould giue place, I ſhould periſh, my houſe ſhould be loſt, the gods vnſerued, the whole Empire eſcandalized: and therefore it is cōuenient, that I execute on them that which they would execute vppon mee: for that it is more conſonant vnto reaſon, that the euil be corrected of ye good, then that the vertuous ſhould come vnder the power of the wicked. Behold Saturninus, what affection I beare thee, that haue layd vp in thy breaſt ſo great a ſecrete, this terrible deede I will put into thy handes: therefore preſently thou muſt depart vnto the Court, and go into his chamber, where Seuerus ſleepeth, and cut off his head: &amp; from Baſſianus his ſonne alſo thou

ſhalt take away his life. Thou ſhalt ſay vnto ye guard, at Court, that euen nowe there came vnto mee a poſt out of Aſia, and art ſent by mee, to giue Seuerus intelligence thereof, and goeſt at ſuch an houre, for that daunger dependeth thereon. And ſince thou haſt not beene abaſhed to heare it, be not terrified to performe it: for that I ſweare vnto thee by the immortal gods, that after Seuerus is dead, and I in the poſſeſſion of the Empire, conformable vnto the great perill wherein nowe thou doeſt aduenture thy ſelfe, ſhall be thy rewards that then thou ſhalt receiue.
                        
                     
                  
               
               Theſe and ſuch other thinges Plautianus ſaid vnto Saturninus: who aunſweared, that hée was readie to do his commaundement, vppon condition, that hée would giue him in writing, in what manner he would haue him to kill Seuerus, and Baſſianus his ſonne: which he deſired to this end, that if in time he ſhould forget the recompence of ſo great a ſeruice, he might ſhewe him that writing, both to remēber the ſeruice paſt, as alſo the reward vnperformed. Plautianus doubted not to giue Saturninus a writing ſigned with his owne hand, wherein hee commaunded to kill Seuerus, and Baſſianus his eldeſt ſonne: the contents of the writing was thus.
               
                  J Plautianus do requeſt as a friend, and commaund as a Cenſor, that thou Saturninus Tribune, do kill the Emperour Seuerus, and Baſſianus his elder ſonne: and for the ſame I promiſe thee, and by the immortall Gods ſweare vnto thee, that as thou art onely in perill, ſo to make thee ſingular in the Empire.
               
                  Saturninus, as a man ſkilfull and ſubtile, for more aſſuraunce vnto Plautianus, vppon his knées kiſt his hand, as though alreadie he had béene ſure of the Empire: and then being in ye déepe of the night, he departeth vnto the Court,

the guard preſently giuing place, and the chāberlaines in like maner: who placing himſelfe directly before Seuerus as he lay in his bed, ſaid theſe words. O Seuerus, how careleſſe art thou of the ambaſſage that thy greatly fauoured Plautianus doth ſend thée, whoſe meſſenger I am, not to giue thée warning (as I do aduiſe thée) but to kill thée and thy ſonne Baſſianus: for that as thou haſt truſted him with thine honour, and giuen him of thy goodes, it ſéemeth vnto him alſo, that thou ſhouldeſt ſerue him with thy life. Great was the admiration of Seuerus, when hee heard what Saturninus ſaid: and yet moſt true, that preſently hee mighte not beléeue the ſame, or could thincke that ſo vile treaſon might be conteyned in Plautianus: but rather yt his ſonne Baſſianus had béene the inuenter thereof, to lead him into diſdaine and hatred againſt Plautianus. Baſſianus being lodged within his father, at his voyce did awake and came foorth, whome his father Seuerus reproued &amp; blamed with words very ſharpe, for the inuention of ſo great euill: and ſware (by the immortal Gods) to receiue him from thenceforth into his further grace and fauour, in the way of reuenge, for ſo great an impietie: for Plautianus was not a man to haue any ſuch thought in his heart. And as Baſſianus had not heard the beginning of Saturninus ſpeach, ſo was hee abaſhed to ſée his father ſo gréeuouſly offended: wheruppon Saturninus ſeeing the incredulitie of the Emperour Seuerus, &amp; how entirely he loued Plautianus, puld foorth his writing, wherein hee was commaunded to kill both him &amp; his ſonne: and further, did humbly craue, that Plautianus might be ſent for, with aduertiſement, that Seuerus and his ſonne were ſlaine, and then it ſhould be ſéene that he would come apparelled not in ſilk, but in yron. One was ſent as from Saturninus, vnto Plautianus to come to Court, where, at his arriuall finding all in ſilence, Saturninus met him at the chamber doore, &amp; receiuing him as new Emperour, vppon his knées did kiſſe his hands, and taking him by the hand in ye darke, ſaid he would direct him where Seuerus was ſtrangled, and his ſonne Baſſianus ſlaine.

                  Plautianus thinking all ſafe &amp; ſure that Saturninus ſaide, entered the chāber alone, where Seuerus &amp; Baſſianus with certaine aſſiſtants were readie to receiue them: whome, when hée beheld liuing, that hée had thought to be dead, he chaunged countenaunce, and loſt his ſpeach.
               
                  A long time was Seuerus reprehending Plautianus, putting him in remembraunce of all thinges which he had done for him, and in eſpeciall, ſo many &amp; great diſpleaſures which he had paſſed for his ſake, and had aduaunced him aboue all perſons in the Empire, and aboue all the reſt, had reuenged him of all his enimies. After Plautianus had a little recouered himſelf, he bowed his knées before his lord Seuerus, and with teares began to craue pardon for his offence, promiſing amendment in time to come, ſaying: that for his owne cauſe, hee ought to pardon him, although hee wanted all deſeruing for any mercie, but to take away all occaſion of reporte in the Empire, that euer he had fauoured ſo wicked a perſon. Beholding Plautianus teares, the promiſes which he made, the hoarie head &amp; beard that he ſo tare, and the great loue that he had borne him, Seuerus was in a maner determined to pardon him: but in the end, being found to be clad in a ſhirt of male, wheron Baſſianus laying his hand, ſaid. Tell mee Plautianus, into princes chambers at ſuch an houre as this, do ſeruauntes enter apparelled in ſilke, or armed with yron: I ſweare vnto thee by the immortall Gods, ſince thou bringeſt yron to kill vs, thou ſhalt here die with yron. And hardly had ended theſe woords, when he began to ſtab him with his dagger, whoe preſently fell downe dead, and was beheaded: whoſe head was fixed vppon a launce ouer the port of Hoſtia, the body deliuered vnto boyes to trayle alongeſt the ſtreates of Rome.
                  
               
               This was the ende and concluſion of the fauoured and priuate Plautianus, whome Fortune ſ

               CHAP. XVII. ¶ Of the particular vices and vertues of Seuerus.
               THe newes being ſpread throughout Rome, that Plautianus was dead, al the people tooke great pleaſure: and no leſſe would haue ioyed, if Plautianus had ſlaine Seuerus and his ſonne Baſſianus: for that all thrée were ſo euil wiſhed in the common wealth, that the leaſt euill which they would them in the common wealth, was but death. The offices that Plautianus held in the common wealth, Seuerus diuided amongeſt the Tribunes, ſimple and plaine mē, and not giuen to trouble: but the loue and fauour which he had vnto Plautianus, he neuer after committed vnto any perſon: for as afterwardes he ſaid, he knew not whome to truſt, ſince his priuate and fauoured ſeruaunt Plautianus would murther him. Plautianus being dead, there was none that might ſuffer or indure ye cruelties of the prince Baſſianus, or follerate his tyrannies: for Baſſianus ſtoode in awe of Plautianus, partly for that he was his father in lawe, as alſo for that he had bred him from his infancie. Seuerus conſidering his ſonnes Baſſianus &amp; Geta to increaſe in age, &amp; decreaſe in wit, cauſed wilde beaſts to be brought for them to kill, horſes to runne, inuenting new playes to practiſe, &amp; therein to occupie their perſons, diuerting their mindes to thoſe games, to reinoue them from vices.
Finding no profite to lead his ſonnes to vertue by thoſe warlike exerciſes, he would cal them in ſecrete, and tel them of many old examples how ſuch and ſuch princes were caſt away by diſcord: and that the ſame miſchance muſt happen vnto them, if they did not behaue themſelues as friends, &amp; fauour eche other as brothers: for that with concord ſmal things increaſe, &amp; by diſcord great things came to nought. Beſids that, ye two brethren were ouerthwart in maners, and peruerſe of conditions, (as before hath beene ſaid) their

tutours did them much hurt: that is to ſay, in diſſembling their vices, &amp; inciting them to greater enimities: whereof Seuerus being aduertiſed, ſome of them he baniſhed, ſome he diſpatched, &amp; ſome he drowned in welles: affirming that they deſerued more puniſhment that kindled enimities, then the perſons that did execute them.
                  Plautianus left a daughter, that was wife vnto Baſſianus, and her ſonne nephue vnto Seuerus, and ſonne vnto Baſſianus: as well the mother that was young, as ye ſonne which was a child they baniſhed into Sicyl, giuing them of al that which they had, no more but to ſerue them wherwt to eate: which Seuerus did, not for enuie that he bare to his nephue &amp; daughter in law, but not to offēd his ſonne Baſſianus, Seuerus did vaunt himſelf, yt his predeceſſours had bin of a citie in Africa, named Tripol, which he did nobilitate, not only in buildings, but alſo in rents &amp; priuileges, and plāted there and orchard of Oliue trées, which did yéeld ſo great quantitie of oyle, yt it was ſufficient for a great part of Africa and Italie, Seuerus was a friend of wiſemē, fauoured, ſtudious, &amp; delt very well with ſuch as were learned: but ioyntly with this, hee did moſt abhorre them, if they were either ouerthwart, or troubleſome: for he vſed to ſay, that fooles ſet neighbours at variance, but men that were wiſe &amp; malicious brought kingdomes together by the eares. He was alſo inclined to read books, and to vnderſtand antiquities: &amp; if he might not by his important affaires read himſelfe, he made others to read: and further, if he chaunced to be ſo buſied, yt he might not read himſelfe, either heare reading at ſuch times they read vnto him when he was eating or whē he went to bed.
He himſelfe did write his owne life, &amp; did write it as truly as if he had béen a chronicler that is to ſay praiſing his victories, &amp; reprehending his vices: and alſo moſt truly, made report of all men that he kild, but not of the ſmal reaſon yt he had ſo to do. Seuerus was much blamed for his great couetiſe of goods, &amp; for want of care &amp; negligēce of his honour: for yt his wife Iulia was a cōmon adultereſſe, whom he did neither chaſtice, or put away: neither is it written, yt euer

he did aduiſe or blame her.
                  It was ſufficient for Seuerus to know his wife to be euil, to be named Iulia, whiche name was euer infamous amongeſt ye womē of Rome. Although he were an enimie of vices, and of vicious mē, much more was he enimie of théeues, aboue all other kinde of wicked people: and ſo is it ſaid and found of him, that he did beare with many malefactors, but neuer pardoned any théefe. In his apparel he was not curious or coſtly, but alwaies was apparelled as a man of great ſobernes: eſpecially, much cō
                     mended, that in his Empire he neuer beheld any perſon in Rome clad with ſilke or purple. Alſo in his féeding he was not diſordinate, &amp; yet truly of certaine fruits of Africa giuē to féede ſomewhat ouermuch, and vſed to ſay, that they had a better reliſhe then others: for that being a child, hee was bred with them. Hée delighted alſo more to eate fiſhe then fleſh, and ſometimes paſſed an whole moneth without the taſt of any fleſh: the fleſh that he beſt loued was mutton, &amp; of fiſh, the Trout. In many cities of ye Empire, they made by his comaundement very notable woorkes: eſpecially in the citie of Tripol in Africa, where he was borne, he made there a fort, &amp; an houſe, &amp; compaſſed it with a very ſtronge wall. He was a prince very careful, that the citie of Rome ſhould alwayes be well prouided, which was manifeſted at his death, at what time they found vij. yeares prouiſion in wheat and oyle.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XVIII. ¶ How Seuerus paſſed into great Britaine, where he died.
               
                  SEuerus being ſettled in ſecuritie, and intending certaine buildinges in Rome, receiued letters from ye gouernour of great Britaine, which now is named England, yt a great part of the Iſland was reuolted from the ſeruice of Rome: and to appeaſe &amp; force them to obedience, his preſence was right neceſſarie: becauſe the Prefect himſelfe was not only denied al obedience, but they ſought meanes alſo to kill him. Seuerus was not diſpleaſed with this newes, although he were both old and ſickly: for that he alwayes deſired the

offer of great things to magnifie his fame, and perpetuate his memorie. Seuerus alſo was pleaſed with thoſe warres, to haue occaſion to withdraw his ſonnes from the vices of Rome: and ſo it came to paſſe, that his elder ſonne Baſſianus he made captaine of the armie that he led by land: &amp; to his younger ſonne Geta, he gaue the charge of his armie &amp; nauie that paſſed by ſea. Seuerus at the ſoudeine and vnprouided, aſſailed the Britaines, who at that inſtāt they vnderſtoode of his arriuall in the Iſle, ſent their Ambaſſadours: partly to yéeld accompt, and partly to diſcharge themſelues of their rebellion, as alſo to ſet downe betwixt them a certeine concord, which Seuerus would neither yéeld vnto, or abide to heare off: for he vented rather to obteine ye renoune of Britaine, then for any reaſon to make them warre. His armies being diſimbarked, &amp; the Ambaſſadours diſpatched, euery man prepared, the one to offend, and the other to defend: Seuerus firſt prouided bridges, wheruppon his horſemen might paſſe, &amp; his foote men auoyd occaſion to ſwim.
The Britaines of that part of Britaine, in thoſe dayes, had a cuſtome in time of warre, to encounter their enimies in lakes &amp; waters, where they did place themſelues vp vnto the arme pits, and from thence did fight and ſhew their ſkil: &amp; when their enimies did ſhoote or whirle their dartes, they would ſtoope or diue vnder water: in ſuch wiſe, that it chā
                     ced thrée ſundrie times, that neuer happened in any part of the world: which is to witt, that 100. naked men, ouercame 1000. armed perſons. Whē at any time they would fight in the field, they vſed certaine targets after the maner of bucklers, &amp; halfe ſwords girt vppon their bare fleſh.
All matters apperteining vnto the warres brought vnto perfection, Seuerus confirmed his younger ſonne Geta, gouernour of a certaine place of the Iſland that had not rebelled, and kept his elder ſonne Baſſianus néere vnto his owne perſon: executing cruel warres vppon the Barbarians, who vppon determination to doe hurte, or offend their enimies, dyed with great hardineſſe: and vppon other determination, would put themſelues to flighte: in whiche

flight their enimies alwayes had the woorſſe.
               The warres being trauerſed after this manner, the gowt did grieuouſly increaſe vppon Seuerus, in ſuch manner, that he could neither go out of his campe, either ſitt in counſel with his capteines: in ſo much, that he was conſtrained to commende the whole charge of the armie vnto his ſonne Baſsianus, who more did practiſe ſecreately to frame hatred amongeſt the armies vnto his brother Geta, then to make conqueſt of the enimies.

                     Baſsianus ſo much reioyced of his fathers griefe, and had ſo great care to inherite, that he ſawe no houre, wherein he wiſhed not his fathers death. Not meaning to leaue any euil vnperfourmed that touched an euil nature, adding euill vnto euill, he ſuborned the Phyſicians that did cure him, and the ſeruaunts that ſerued him, in ſuch wiſe, the one to ſerue him, and the other cure him, that if the gowte did not finiſh him, poiſon ſhoulde diſpatche him. Although no man ſaid vnto Seuerus any one woorde, he did well perceiue what his ſonne Baſsianus deſired: and ſo it came to paſſe, that beholding the diſobedience which his ſonne did beare him, &amp; howe euil his ſeruaunts ſerued him, and howe ſlenderly his Phyſician did viſite him: although he were olde and ſickely, he died of pure ſorrowe, and melancholy. The laſt wordes which Seuerus ſaide, before he dyed, they ſaye were theſe.
                  When I tooke the Empire, I founde the common wealth throughout the worlde in trouble, and nowe I dye, I leaue it in peace: and although I dye without power to teſtar ny firmar, yet I leaue the Empire firme vnto my two ſonnes Antonines: if they ſhal proue good, they remaine exactly made princes: and if they ſhal be euil, I leaue them nothing. Before Seuerus dyed, he commaunded two Fortunes of gold to be made, for either of his ſonnes one: becauſe it was the enſigne of the Empire, to take away all occaſion after his death, for any of them, by him ſelfe, or for him ſelfe, to be aduaunced with the Empire, but equally to remaine in power and eſtate. This was the ende of Seuerus, whome his enimies might

not kill with armes: and yet with griefe and ſorrowe was ſlaine by his ſonnes. Seuerus liued thrée ſcore and fiftéene yeres, and reigned two and twentie yeres: his bones were burnt, and the aſhes carried to Rome.
                  
               
               
                  Of this Emperour Seuerus, the Senate determined that, which of no other prince was determined, namely, Illum aut naſci non debuiſſe, aut mori: whiche is to ſaye: It had beene good (in reſpect of his cruelties which he did) he had not beene borne: and ſince that he was borne, (in conſideration of the profite which he did in the common wealth) it had beene good he had not died.
                  
               
            
         
         
            
               The life of the Emperour Baſsianus, ſonne vnto Seuerus, compiled by ſyr Anthonie of Gueuara, Biſhop of Mondonnedo, preacher, chronicler, and counſeller vnto the Emperour Charles the fifte.
            
               CHAP. I. ¶Howe Baſsianus and his brother Geta did inherite the Empire of their father Seuerus.
               
                  PReſently after the death of the Emperour Seuerus in great Britaine, his two ſonnes, Baſsianus and Geta, did ſuccéed him in the Empire, betwixt whome there was extreme diſcorde and cruell hatred: for, notwithſtanding in bloude they were brothers, yet in wil &amp; works they dealt as enimies. As Baſsianꝰ was elder brother, and alſo more cauillous &amp; troubleſome, ſo he began ſecretely to practiſe and ſubborne the capteines of

the armie to him onely to giue the Empire, and to exclude Geta his younger brother from the inheritaunce: and to drawe them vnto his purpoſe, he ſpake ſwéete wordes, blinded them with faire promiſes of greate hope, and alſo gaue them riche Iewels. Nothing might Baſsianus attaine with the capteines of his armie, for that euery one in particular, and all in generall, made him aunſwer, that ſince they were ſonnes vnto their lord Seuerus, and bothe brethren, and ioyntly had ſworne vnto them as their Lordes and Princes, it were not iuſt they ſhould be traytours in their promiſe vnto their father: or ſhoulde make a breache of their othe, that in the temples they had ſworn vnto the Gods.
               After that Baſsianus might not corrupt the armie with woordes, déedes, or giftes, he tooke peace with the Britans, to the ende preſently to departe towardes Rome: and his brother Geta being aduertiſed that Baſsianus ſought the Empire vnto him ſelfe, which the father Seuerus had lefte vnto them both, grewe into great hatred &amp; diſdaine with his brother: in ſuch wiſe, that from thenceforth, the two brethren behaued them ſelues, not only as vtter enimies, but alſo the courte was diuided into bandes. Baſsianus &amp; Geta were brethren by the father, but not by the mother: for that Baſsianus was his ſonne by his firſt wife, and Geta by Iulia whiche was the ſecond wife. Geta his mother, and the auncient and honourable Romanes that were remaining after the death of Seuerus, did not a little trauaile to confederate and ſet them at agréement: but in the ende, they were neither conuinced with the infinite beares of the mother, either might be perſuaded by the great requeſtes and inſtant intreatance of their friendes. The affaires of Britaine being ſet in order, the two brethren much without order, departed towardes Rome, carrying with them the reliques of their father Seuerus, that is to ſay, his bones made aſhes, which in all cities, as they paſſed, were receiued with as great reuerence, as if Seuerus had béene aliue.
               
                  From the time that Baſsianus &amp; Geta departed from Britaine, vntil they entred Rome, they neuer lodged in one lodging, or fedde at one table, or had conference vppon the waye, but had of eache other great ſuſpicion: yea in meat and drinke to haue receiued poyſon. To go in ſo greate doubt and ſuſpicion, was cauſe of ſmall ſtaye vppon the waye, although it were very long: and before their comming vnto Rome, either of them had ſent their ſecreate meſſengers, not onely to take vp the beſt lodginges in Rome, but alſo to ſolicite and to winne the willes of the common wealth, becauſe they conceiued, that they might not ioyntly be conſerued in their ſeigniorie, but that one muſt remaine with the Empire. That day on which Baſsianus and Geta his brother ſhoulde enter Rome, all Rome came foorth to receiue them, which was mixed wt ioye and ſorrowe: ſorrowe, for the death and buriall of Seuerus: and ioye, for that his children were come aliue to reigne in his ſteade. Entring into the citie, the two brethren and newe Emperours went before, appareled in purple, on horſſebacke: after them, came the Senatours all on foote, who bare on their ſhoulders, a cheſt of Unicorne, wherein was placed the aſhes of Seuerus: ſuch perſons as attended the dead went wéeping: and thoſe that accompanied Baſsianus &amp; Geta went ſinging. Being entred into the citie, and the day farre ſpent, they went vnto the temple of the greate Emperour Marcus Aurelius, where the two newe Princes fell on their knées to adore his ſepulchre, as a moſte holie man, and there beſtowed the aſhes of their father Seuerus. Before Seuerus departed vnto the ſecond warres of Britaine, he had begon a moſt ſumptuous ſepulchre in the fielde of Mars: amongeſt other ornaments that it had, were ſeuen pillers poliſhed verie high and ſtately, wherein was grauen all his actes and victories: but his life firſt was finiſhed, before his ſepulture was ended.
            
            
               
               CHAP. II. ¶Howe in Rome they burie their Emperours, and of greate ceremonies which there they vſed.
               After that Baſſianus and Geta his brother had repoſed the body of their father Seuerus in the temple of the Emperour Marcus Aurelius, preſently they beganne to conſecrate his body, and to place his ſoule with the Gods, accordinge to the cuſtome of the Romans: whiche ceremony was not done, but vnto dead Emperours: and the order thereof was thus.
Preſently vpon the death of an Emperour, the Senate did aſſemble to determine, if hee deſerued to be buried with the Godes, either els after his burial to leaue him to obliuion as other men: and if he had beene euill, the Senate woulde be abſent at his buriall: and if he had bene good, all clad in blacke, woulde attend to conſecrate his body. And to do the ſame, their firſte attempt was to bury the body of the deade prince without any ceremonie, and then made him an image of woode after the manner of a ſicke and colourleſſe man, which they placed alofte vpon a ſcaffolde ouer the Courte gate: and that image, although it were of a ſicke man, yet did they clad it with garmentes of ſilcke and golde, as though the counterfeite were aliue. In the hight of that ſcaffolde, or throne, the Senate were ſet on the lefte hande, and on the right hand all the matrones of Rome: of whome none might he apareled richly, either deckt with iuels of gold or ſtone: 
                        •
                     ut all perſones were there clad in white, for that all white apparell in Rome was counted mourning. The Senatours and matrones were placed and ſett at the riſinge of the ſunne, and did not riſe vntill the ſunne was ſet: there might they neither ſpeake, or gaze about, but all that time was conſumed in ſighing, wéeping, and wayling
               
               
                  From houre to houre, Phyſicians came and went to viſite that Image, and ſo did raiſe, beholde, and féele his pulſes, as if the Emperour him ſelfe had béene there aliue, and alwayes at their parting would report vnto the Senatours and ladies, that the ſicke perſon drewe on to death. At which newes, the matrones did grite and ſhriche, and the Senatours did wéepe and waile. This order they vſed ſeuen dayes together, but firſt vpon the ſixt day, the Phyſicians did forſake the ſicke perſon, and finally, on the ſeuenth day manifeſtly would publiſh his death: preſently after he was denounced for dead, placeing the handles of the baire whereon the Image of the dead was laide vpon their ſhoulders, the chiefeſt and moſte honourable Senatours on horſſebacke did beare the ſame: and after this maner went vnto the place named Vaieia, and might not go by any other way but by the ſacred waye, whiche was a tracke where no man durſt paſſe, but Emperours that were dead and prieſtes that were aliue. In that place named Vaieia, there was another buylding made of ſtone, after the manner of a Throne, hauing on bothe ſides degrées and ſtaires to mount aloft, where they did place the Image of the dead Emperour: vpon the one ſtaires, ſtoode children, the ſonnes of the gentlemen of Rome, and on the other parte ſtoode the damſels and virgins of Rome, and there did ſinge many ſorrowfull ſonges and hymnes, publiſhed in the praiſe of the dead. From thence they remoued the baire with the Image of the dead, vnto the fielde of Mars, where alſo was made another ſcaffold, all of drie woode, vnder the vaut whereof was laide ſtubble, ſtalkes, and ſtrawe, and other kindling matter to burne: the outſide was brauely painted, and hanged with rich tapeſtrie, and aloft vpon the higheſt parte thereof, they placed the Image of the dead Emperour. On the day in which this ceremonie was perfourmed in Rome, they did concurre to beholde the ſame from all partes of Italie: and euerye Lord and ladie that was preſent, did throwe vppon the degrées of that Throne, Myre, incenſe, aloes, amber, roſes,

and other thinges of fragrant ſauours. When all men had offered their ſwéet perfumes, the Senatours did ſkirmiſh on horſſeback, and preſently after them the two Cō
                  ſuls gaue a boylt aloft on their chariots gorgeouſly adorned: and after them there followed on foote, all the auncient Romanes and neighbourhood of Rome, and all ſuch as had béene captaines of the warres: all which after they had gone a turne about the Throne, fel downe groueling, exclaming very lowde againſt the ground. After the thrée proceſſions were done, which is to wéete, of ye Senatours, of the Conſuls, and of the capteines, came he that did inherite the Empire, who with a burning torche, gaue fire to that Throne, whiche being all of drye ſtuffe, preſently was conſumed. Before the beginning of this great ceremonie, the Senate ſought out againſt that day a braue Eagle, which was placed betwixt the handles of ye baire, where the Image of the dead was laide: with great ſkill and ſubtiltie, at the time that the Image burnt, the Eagle was looſed and flewe away: and as her proper nature is to flye vpwarde, all men ſaide with loude voices, that it was the ſoule of the dead Emperour, that was gone to the Goddes vp to heauen. As oft as ye ſhall finde theſe words written of any Prince or notable perſonage, namely: Inter diuos relatus eſt, that is, they haue placed him with the Gods, all theſe ceremonies were done vnto him: vnto ſuch a one, from thenceforth, they might ſacrifice, adore, make temples, and place Prieſtes, in ſuch manner, they had to honour him as a God, and not to talke of him, as of a man.
            
            
               CHAP. IIII. ¶Of the mortall hatred betwixt Baſsianus and Geta his brother.
               AFter the two brethren had accompliſhed the funerall office of their father Seuerus, they went bothe to lodge

in the ſacred palace: not ioyntly, but parting the lodging betwixt them, euery one placing porters by them ſelues, and their gard to attende vpon them. Although their lodging was one, yet their willes and diſpoſitions were diuers: and ſuche as had to deale in matters of importance, conferred not with them, but with their mother: who tooke the opinion of the one, and ſo of the other, whiche afterwardes was perfourmed by aduiſe and conſent of the Senate: becauſe otherwiſe the common wealth ſhoulde haue runne at randon and be loſt. Theſe two Princes neuer ioyntly came foorth, but when they went to the Senate, or to viſite the temple of the greate Emperour Marcus Aurelius: for Seuerus had commaunded, that weekely they ſhould offer ſacrifices in that temple, and monethly his heires ſhould viſite that ſepulchre. Baſsianus and his brother Geta, had ſmall care to viſite temples, offer ſacrifices, go to the Senate, reforme the comon wealth, either prouide neceſſarie matter for the warres: but all their bent and ſtudie was, the one to beguyle the other, &amp; to winne the willes of the people: to the ende that one being dead, the other might reigne without contradiction. Both the brethren being thus diuided, and bothe leading the Empire into handes: notwithſtanding that bothe had enimies and friendes, yet alwayes the greater parte of the common wealth were more affectionate to the younger
ſonne, which was Geta. Geta was white and redde, high, ſharpe, milde, nimble, of groaſe lightueſſe, and of verie good condition: and yet in reſpect of reigning he was as proude as Baſsianus. Baſsianus his brother was a falowe blacke, cholerike aduſt, little of bodie, broade forehead, muche ſkinne on his handes, hollowe and hoarſe of voice, preignant, ſubtile, diligent, and a iyar: for if he néeded anything, he would flatter all men with faire words, and after enuen all things in lies.
The diuiſions euery day proceedinge from euil to woorſe, it was beyonde all mennes powers, to bring them agreed, or make them friendes: they bothe deuiſed, without aduertiſement of

any perſon to diuide the Empire: the manner was, that all kingdomes ſhould equally be diuided in two partes, &amp; that the name of Emperour ſhould be indifferent vnto them both.
               There was allotted vnto Baſsianus all Europe, &amp; vnto Geta his brother the kingdoms of Aſia: and the end wherfore they diuided the Empire, was, not to be friendes from thenceforth, but to haue libertie, men, and riches, to riſe with Rome: and he that might do moſt, to diſpatche the other of his life. When this agréement was made, they determined to call their mother Iulia, and all the aunciēt ſeruauntes and friendes of the houſe of Seuerus their father: vnto whome Baſsianus gaue to vnderſtand, how his brother and he had agréed, and were become friendes: and their agréement was, that they had diuided the Empire, he remaining with the eſtate and ſeat of Rome, and Geta his brother hauing Antioche the head of his Empire, and the eſtate of all Aſia. As Baſsianus then ſaide, ſo it was agréed, that ye goods of the patrimonie were diuided in thrée partes, two partes for the two brethren, and the third for Iulia their mother: and further, that all Senatours, capteines, and other notable perſons of the Empire, fréely (if they ſo liked) might go with Geta into Aſia, or remaine with Baſsianus in Rome. There was no man there that liked this agréement, much leſſe allowed ye ſame: for they all did ſée it was but fained, and that ere long the Empire would be inflamed with warres, as in the dayes of Iulius Caeſar and Pompeyus, of Caeſar Auguſtus, and Marcus Antonius. Although all men were grieued with yt which was ſaide, yet all men did both diſſemble and kéepe ſilence, wt ſad countenance caſting their eyes to the ground: which their mother Iulia, poſſeſſing patience in ſufficient, aunſwered and ſaide vnto them as followeth.
            
            
               CHAP. IIII. ¶Of an excellent ſpeache vttered by the mother vnto her ſonnes.
               
                  I may wel call ye ſonnes (O children of my heart) ſince thou Geta proceededſt from mine intrailes, &amp; thee Baſsianus I haue nouriſhed with my breaſtes: &amp; I ſweare by the immortall Gods, that much greater is the loue that I bare thee, then the affinitie which I haue with thy brother. Thou well knoweſt Baſsianus, that from the firſt houre that I came to the court, &amp; was wife vnto thy father Seuerus, I had the name of mother in lawe, &amp; the works of a perfect mother: and that many times thou didſt requeſt mee to cheriſh thy brother Geta, for that it ſeemed vnto thee he was not fauoured: in ſuch wiſe, that if he be the only perſon that I haue borne, thou only waſt he that was cheriſhed. I haue great reaſon to call you my children, &amp; to bewaile you as children, to talke with you as children: for on the day yt the one proceeded frō my bowels, the other entred into my harte. Maruell ye not to ſee mee powre forth ſo many teares, &amp; at euery worde to be diſmaide &amp; ſwoone? for, as ye ſee my ſorrowfull eyes, ſo may you behold my lamentable heart: ye ſhould well perceiue it guſh out more with bloud, then mine eyes doe flowe with teares. If my husbande &amp; your father ſhoulde heare that which I heare, and ſhould ſee that which I ſee, it would grieue him that euer ye were borne: and no leſſe, that euer he begate you: becauſe you wil giue no credite vnto your friendes, either obey me your ſorrowfull mother, or perfourme his will &amp; cōmaundemēt. Wherfore do ye ſeeke the whole for one, ſince he left the ſame for bothe? what an heauie matter is this my children? the Gods haue created ye brethren, and you haue conuerted your ſelues enimies: the glory which ye poſſeſſe, to haue had ſuch a father: ye would quite

him with ſo much griefe, to haue ſo frowarde children. To leaue the Empire entire, your father ſlewe Iulianus, Peſſenius Niger, and Albinius, that helde it diuided in three partes: and nowe againe ye will diuide and rent it in pieces. Do ye not vnderſtand, howe Princes that haue their willes vnited, neede not to diuide their countries? Haue ye not heard ſay, that to obteine honour, &amp; to defende that which we poſſeſſe, for theſe two only things, &amp; for no other cauſe warre is raiſed betwixt kinges and princes? If this be true (as it is) and both you falling out for goods, knowe ye not, that your father onely of him ſelf, hath left ye more then all the Princes of the worlde haue left vnto them? And if it ſo be, that ye ſtriue for the attainement of honour, I knowe not to what ende ye would haue more honour, then to be Emperours of Rome. O immortall Gods! I inuocate, and moſte humbly pray you, that ye deale not according to the childiſhneſſe of theſe young men, but agreeable vnto the great ſeruice which their father hath done you, &amp; the abundance of teares which their lamentable mother hath powred foorth: for otherwiſe, the memory of my Lord Seuerus ſhal periſh &amp; be loſt, &amp; the maieſtie of ye Empire put in great danger. If we did think (my children) yt this diuiſion of the Empire, might be an occaſiō frō henceforth to deale &amp; liue like brethrē, we would hold it all for good, and thinke it all right well: but what doth it profite, that ye haue diuided the Empire onely in two partes: and ye twaine remaine diuided in an hundreth thouſande differences? If ye wil be fauoured of the Gods, &amp; obeyed of men, call to remembrance your fathers commaundement: condeſcend vnto your mothers requeſt, and yealde

your ſelues vnto the iudgement of your friendes: for that young Princes do neuer knowe to gouerne wel, if they permitt not to be gouerned of the vertuous. Conſider children, that ye are but younglings, and in great affaires haue ſmall experience: and that your youth ſhall leade you vnto many vices, &amp; your ſmal experience cauſe you to fall in great &amp; many errours. Alſo (my children) ye haue to conſider, that ye poſſeſſe your heartes too much paſsioned, and go inuironed with many lyars: which two thinges be moſt cruell and enorme, in the perſons &amp; houſes of princes: becauſe with their paſsion, they committ much iniuſtice, and by lies, they cloake many foule and pernicious deedes. The paſsioned and furious hearte is ſufficed with his owne furie, to be lead into all errours: and the lyar defendeth him from all knowlege and acquaintaunce of his owne fault. If ye remember your ſelues, that ye be men, and that I am a woman, with great reaſon ye might haue ſmall regarde vnto that which I do ſay: but if ye conſider that ye be my children, and I your mother, greate eſtimation ſhould ye conceiue of my counſelles: for that credite which I loſe to be a woman, I recouer for that I am your mother. If ye did loue your father, as your father loued you, your ſorrowful mother ſhould haue no cauſe ſo much to perſuade you to be friendes: for that to remoue all cauſes to bring his honour in diſputation, ye would refuſe &amp; caſt behind you all intereſt whatſoeuer of any goods. Since ye will not liue in peace, in as muche as it toucheth the ſeruice vnto the Gods, and the great miſchiefes that muſt follow your owne perſons, and the infamie wherewith ye ſhall infect your dead father, yet ſhoulde ye doe the

ſame, for the loue and behalfe of your liuing mother: becauſe the diſſentions, trauelles, and infidelities of the children, many they be that doe beholde them: but in the ende, the mothers do onely bewaile them. Againſt the teſtament of your father, without the will of your mother, contrarie vnto the cuſtome of the Senate, and without aduiſe of any friend, ye haue betwixt you diuided the empire, leauing me vnto my ſelfe to be diuided: wherein, ſpeaking conformably vnto iuſtice, it had beene more reaſon ye ſhould haue diuided your owne proper mother, then the landes &amp; countries of others. O immortal Gods, vvhy haue ye taken away my Lord Seuerus vnto your ſelues, and left me placed in ſo many daungers and trauels? ſince ye haue giuen me two children, why was not giuen me two heartes? and if I craue two hearts, it is but to loue them: but two thouſand hearts wil not ſuffice to endure their vnkindneſſe. O my children, (although no children of my counſelles) for that, though ye be mine by birth, yet are ye become ſtraungers by diſobedience. I knowe not my childrē, what to ſay more vnto you: but ſince ye be twaine, and my heart but one: that ye pull it foorth, &amp; open it in the middeſt, and diuide it as ye haue diuided the Empire: and yet by the veſtall mother, I ſweare vnto you, that if ye opened my heart, and made ſearch therein, ye ſhoulde finde in the ſame the greatneſſe of my loue, but much more, that I ſuffer and am tormented.
            
            
               CHAP. V. ¶Howe Baſsianus, to obteine the Empire vnto him ſelfe, ſlewe his brother in his mothers armes.
               
                  JT was lamentable to heare the Empreſſe Iulia, but much more to beholde her, who ſéeing her children ſo extremely diuided, and ſo farre from fraternitie, at euery woorde which ſhée ſaide, the Heauens did cleaue with ſighes, and the ground was watered with teares. At the inſtant ſhée finiſhed her talke, ſhée roſe from her chayre, &amp; going to her ſonnes▪ with the right hande ſhée taketh Baſſianus, and Geta with the left, imbraceing them with her ſelfe, traueiling to cauſe them to imbrace, and to be reconciled and ioyning all their thrée faces together, with ye aboundaunt teares of the mother, the faces of her ſonnes were all wett and bedewed. Many Romanes that were preſent began to mourne, in hearing what Iulia ſaide, and afterwardes howe with her children ſhée did behaue her ſelfe: no man replyed or ſpake more woordes, in as much as all men did allowe that which the mother ſaide: and improued the diuiſion of the Empire which the ſonnes had made.
               The heartes of theſe two Princes were ſo muche paſſioned, and ioyntly therewith of nature ſo indurate, that when the mother did talke vnto them, it ſeemed not, but that they were thinking of ſome other matter: which had moſt perfect apparaunce, becauſe at that time they were neither moued with compaſſion of her teares, either afterwardes did take any profite of her counſell. The mother only profited not in her traueile to reconcile them, but that from thenceforth th
                     •
                  y ceaſed not to diſcouer greter hatred: that is to ſaye, in that either of them ſought to corrupt each others bloud, promiſing greate wealth in Rome to be giuen vnto him that would confect his lordes meate with poyſon. When Baſsianus perceiued, that he might not (by any meane) diſpatche his brother Geta with poyſon, and ioyntly therewith, that the Romanes were ſomewhat inclined vnto him by affection, determined on a daye, when all perſons were moſte inclined to ſléepe at after noone, to go vnto the lodging of his mother Iulia,
                  
with whome Geta remained: and finding them at their reſt, he gaue Geta ſo many ſtabbes with a dagger, that he was bereft of his life. When Baſsianus ſet vpon his brother Geta, the mother to ſaue him, caſt her ſelfe vppon him: notwithſtanding he ceaſed not to wound him, and kill him, The caſe was thus, that with one blowe he both wounded his brother, and imbrewed the garment of the mother: and finally, the brother remained dead, and the mothers garments defiled.
               This done Baſsianus goeth foorth through al the court, exclaming with a loude voyce, and with greate feare and trembling: treaſon, treaſon, my brother Geta would haue ſlaine me by treaſon in my bed, and if I had not leapt out at a windowe, and the deſtinies beene fauourable vnto mee at that inſtant, I had not eſcaped with life: and not ſatiſfied with that which was ſaide, he commaunded his garde to conduct him out of the court, and to garde and attende him vnto mount Celius, where the Pretorian bands were lodged, infourminge that in ye palace there was no ſafetie: for that his brother had attempted to murther him.
               All men that heard the exclamation that Baſsianus made, did beléeue that all things had paſſed as he had ſaid: and the Eſquiers of the bodie did accompanie and attende him, vntil they had brought him amongeſt the Pretorians: and entring the tent where they had their armour and pendons, knéeling vppon his knées, hee gaue greate thankes vnto the Gods, that had preſerued him vnto that place: and alſo vnto his garde, that had ſuccoured him in time of ſo great néede. To beholde Baſsianus go at ſuche an houre, with ſo greate an heate, through the middeſt of Rome, and that with ſo great furie, all that beheld him were eſcandalized: and did imagine amongeſt them ſelues, that he had ſlaine his brother, or done ſome vile déede vnto his mother in lawe. Aſſoone as he ſawe him ſelfe amongeſt the Pretorians, he diuided amongeſt them, two thouſande &amp; fiue hundreth drachmes of golde, according

to the weight of Athens
                  ▪ &amp; further, promiſed to giue them yerely, wheate to furniſh their families, beſides their ordinarie wages. The fame being divulgate throughout Rome, and the trueth knowen of the great treaſon which Baſsianus had committed, Geta his friends ioyned to ſéeke him, with a determined purpoſe extremely to haue reuē
                  ged Geta: and as the matter was put to armes, and came to hande gripes, Geta his friendes being the fewer in number, were ſoone ouercom: which although they were ſubdued, yet truely deſerue no diſpraiſe: being but fewe in number, ſéeing their Lorde dead, and Baſsianus in poſſeſſion of the armie, they wanted no hardineſſe to fight, &amp; no leſſe courage to dye: but what ſhall we ſaye, but that if their quarell were iuſt, their fortune was verie croſſe. Small aduantageth it that the minde be generous, and the bodie warlike, if he that taketh armes be vnfortunate: for that one houre of happie fortune, is more woorth then all policies of warre. Greate was the compaſſion that all men conceiued of the cruell death of Geta, and no leſſe was the hate which they did beare vnto Baſsianus, not only to kill him vppon ſo greate aſſurance, but alſo to murther him in a place of ſo great priuiledge, that is to ſaye, within the ſacred palace, &amp; imbraced within the breaſtes of his mother. When Baſsianus ſawe that his brother

                     Geta was dead, all his alies and ſeruaunts ouercome, &amp; that whatſoeuer he had attempted with temeritie, ſuccéeded with great proſperitie: he went vnto the temples, and tooke from thence all their treaſure, in ſuch wiſe, hee tooke away in one daye, that which manie princes had giuen in many yeres. A greate quantitie of thoſe treaſures Baſsianus diuided amongeſt his Pretorians: who ſeeing themſelues riche in money, and that their enimies were ſubdued, went into Rome, began to enter into the houſes, and killed all perſons with whome they had vnkindneſſe: but that which was more odious, vppon wagers would kill a whole kinred, vntil they left no perſone, in whome any remembrance might remaine.
               
               
                  Many noble perſons were determined to haue ſlaine Baſſianus, in the beginning of his Empire: which they left not vndone for his deſeruing, either for want of will, but for doubt that after his death, many ſhould riſe with the Empire: for preſently they thought it leſſe euill to ſuffer one, then to reſiſt many.
               
               Now when Baſſianus ſawe himſelfe rich in treaſure of the temples, and obeyed of the Pretorians, he determined to mount aloft vpon the high Capitol, and there to ſpeake vnto the Senat: partly to giue accompt of that which was done, and partly to giue them to vnderſtād what he would doe. Being placed in the middeſt of the Senate, and ſet in the imperiall chaire, and euery man vſing ſilence, he ſaid after this manner.
            
            
               CHAP. VI. ¶ Of a certaine ſpeach vſed of Baſſianus vnto the Senate, excuſing himſelfe of the death of his brother Geta.
               ALthough in age I am but younge, and in mine attemptes reputed as raſh, yet I ceaſe not to confeſſe that I am in great hatred with the people: and that my death ſhould as much content them, as now my life is diſpleaſant vnto them. And as princes are in the view of all perſons, ſo are all their works iudged of al men: and from thence it procedeth, that their iuſt attempts are praiſed of many, but their errours condemned of all. They that preſume to iudge the woorkes of princes, are not alwayes ſo iuſte, that they iudge continually conformable vnto iuſtice: for as many times they praiſe the prince with lies: ſo it may happen, yt they accuſe them with malice. One of the extremeſt trauels

that princes haue, is: that ſuch as throng in themſelues to talke of our liues, and to examine our deeds and actes, they talke not as we liue, but as we vſe and deale with them: for if we honour &amp; magnifie them, they report we be no princes, but gods: but if we chaſtiſe and bring them downe, they ſay wee be no men but furies. Many times princes do chaſtiſe many, not becauſe we delight to puniſh, but yt it ſo agreeth with the imperiall authoritie ſo to be done: for as with rewardes and pardons wee magnifie our pierie &amp; clemencie, ſo it is cōuenient, that with rigorous chaſtiſements, wee make our iuſtice to bee eſteemed. Many preſume to iudge the vices of princes, which if they were princes, would not onely commit thinges worthie of iudgement, but alſo iuſtly to be depriued of the Empire: for the knowledge of good gouernement, is not a thing that men obtaine of themſelues: but a gift which the Gods do giue vnto whome they pleaſe.
               There is no prince ſo abſolute or diſſolute, that at the leaſt, in his gouernment deſireth not to be iuſt: but what ſhall wee doe, that haue no more power but to wiſh to do well? and the gods onely to giue grace to gouerne well. But comming to the caſe now chaunced, for which the whole multitude with me be eſcā
                  dalized: I ſweare by the immortall gods, yt if the truth as it was were manifeſted, I ſhould be found without blame: but I am of the one part ſo vnfortunate, and of th other part the multitude is ſo variable, that it many times happeneth, that of my manifeſt actes they ſay nothing: and of that which neuer paſſed my thought, they accuſe me. O ye iuſt gods, vnto you all I appeale as witneſſes: who firſt would haue kild ye other, either whether my brother Geta would haue ſlaine mee, or

I would haue ſlaine him: for ye well vnderſtand, that being repoſed on my bed, he entered vpon me with a naked ſword: with which hee would haue drawne forth my ſoule, if by chaunce I had not found one at my beds head. If hee was the beginner of that quarrel, and that fortune would fauour me at that inſtant, wherefore being vtterly without any fault, ſhould I be blamed of all perſons in Rome? What greater teſtimonie would ye of my innocencie, but reſpecting that hee being the perſon that offended, and I the man that defended my ſelfe, the gods haue brought vppon him, that which hee ment to perfourme on mee: neither in any good iudgement may it be conteined, that if by malice or enuie I would haue ſlaine my brother, that I ſhould execute the ſame by ſtealth, and within the ſacred palace, for that in ſo enorme a caſe, I deſerued not ſo much chaſtiſement for the deede, as to committe the ſame in the place where that was done.
               I will not denie, that vnto my brother I was not bound to honour him, loue him, ſuccour him, and to deale well with him: but I will not confeſſe that I was bound, for all treaſons and iniuries to ſuffer him: for as it is honourable for great princes, to diſſemble &amp; pardō iniuries, that are done to them by their inferiours: ſo neceſſarie is it for them to reuenge the diſcourteſies and diſpleaſures, done vnto them by their betters or equals. It is notorious vnto al men, that in times paſt, many princes of the Romaine Empire had brethren, with whom they might not endure, but that many of them were ſlaine▪ or at the leaſt driuen out of the Empire: for in fine, there is none of ſo great temperaunce, that in caſe of commaundement,

would haue a companion: no not his brother.
               Conſider the behauiour of Remus and Romulus, Tiberius and Germanicus, Titus and Domitian, Marcus and Lucius, &amp; others infinite that were brethren: amongeſt whome, vppon the point of commaundement and gouernement, there aroſe ſo great diſpleaſures and vnkindnes: not as though they had beene natural brethren, but as moſt cruel enimies. O fathers conſcript and friends, giue thanks vnto the Gods, that haue preſerued your prince ſafe &amp; ſoūd. for that with out cauſe they would not haue giuen him his death, and conſerued my life: for the workes of our gods are ſo profound, ſecreate, and vnknowne, that althoughe wee ſee what they doe: yet wee ſee not the end why they do it. Amongeſt all the gods, onely Iupiter is he that hath dominion, and ſo amongeſt al men the god Iupiter would not, but that onely one ſhould poſſeſſe the Empire: for it were no leſſe monſtruous to gouerne the Empire by two perſons, then one body to haue two heads. If for all the Heauens, one God be ſufficient, and for all Bees but one king, and all members be gouerned with one heart, &amp; all birds haue but one guide: I demaund of you my friends, to gouerne the common wealth of Rome, if one man be not ſufficient? As we haue read in bookes of our forefathers, and as we haue ſeene in our dayes, there is nothing more conuenient vnto the Romane Empire, as to be gouerned by one only perſon: for that we haue ſeene more warres raiſed, vppon which prince ſhould commaund, then for any diſobedience of ſubiects. Howe fierce warres were raiſed betwixt Silla &amp; Marius, Caeſar and Pompeie, Auguſtus and Marcus Antoninus, Galba and Othos, Othos and Bytellus, Bytellus

and Vaſpaſianus: &amp; now of late betwixt Seuerus my father, and Iulianus and Albinius. All theſe great calamities, whiche the miſerable common wealth of Rome hath ſuffered, was not for that many would not be commaunded: but for that many would commaund. Admitting that my father commaunded in his teſtament, that Geta my brother and I ſhould diuide the Empire: yet many doe know, &amp; they are not fewe which preſume, that he would neuer haue done it, but his wife and my mother in lawe conſtrained him ſo to aſſigne: and in a caſe ſo great, hard &amp; graue, reſpect ought not to be giuen to that whiche hee did, but vnto that which he would haue done: becauſe the magnificence of the Empire, and the wiſedome of the Senate, ought not to be bound, to the procurement of a vaine woman: but vnto that which is moſt conuenient for the common wealth.
            
            
               CHAP. VII. ¶Of the great crueltie of Baſſianus, and of ſuch as he commaunded to be ſlaine.
               ALl the time that Baſſianus vſed this ſpeach vnto ye Senate, no mā cut off his talk, or when he had finiſhed, no perſon durſt aunſwere one word: but that he in ending his tale, beheld all his friends: &amp; ſuch as he ſuſpected, he would not once looke vppon: wherof they remained not only deſpited, but alſo terrified: becauſe the thinge that the heart loueth, is ſeene and knowne by the vents and windowes of the eyes. Neither for that Baſſianus had ſaid in open place, either for any aduiſement of friends in ſecrete, did he ceaſe to continue his cruelties: but that preſently he commaunded to be ſlaine, not onely ſuch as his brother Geta held for

friends, but alſo the friends of his friends. He ſlue all the
ſeruaunts and officers of his brother, not only ſuch as ſerued him in the common wealth, but all ſuch alſo, as ſerued him in all maner of vile things of his houſe: that is to ſay, cookes, butlers, caters, ſwéepers, moile kepers, turne ſpits, and boyes of the kitchen: at the death of whom, albeit both before and after he ſlue many: yet of none had they ſo great compaſſion in Rome as of thoſe perſons. Alſo he ſlue al his wagginers, all his horſekéepers, all his bakers, all his laū
                     derers, all his muſicians, al his taylers, finallie, he ſlue all that his brother loued: and all ſuch as did ſerue him. Hée ſlue all the Senatours and officers of Rome, that folowed the parcialitie of his brother Geta, and kilde all Queſtors, Pretors, and valiant capitaines, throughout the Empire. He ſlue Lucilla, an excellent matrone of Rome, ſiſter vnto the Emperour Commodus, and daughter vnto the great Marcus Aurelius, whome all Emperours paſt did honour as an Empreſſe, and ſerued as a mother: and this was in ſuch wiſe, that as any temple of Rome her houſe was priuileged. The cauſe wherefore they ſay, he ſlue the Lady Lucilla, was: for that, when ſhe heard of the death of Geta, ſhee went vnto the Courte to comfort the mother, and bewailed her ſorrowe: whereof Baſſianus being aduertiſed, ſaid. Since Lucilla mourneth for the death of my brother Geta, with my mother in law: it ſignifieth that ſhe would ioy of his life, and of my death: but I will liue, and ſhe ſhal die. Alſo he ſlue many of the veſtall virgins, ſome that he accuſed for breaking their virginitie: and others, for that they preſumed to be virgins: ſaying it was a ieſt, to beleue that any might liue and die a virgine in this life.
                  
               
               
                  He ſlue an auncient knight named Letus, which was at the death of Commodus: and alſo was acquainted with the death of Geta his brother. He ſlue Rufus a knight of Africa, and his néere kinſman, that is to ſay, his vnckles ſonne, who at the euening did inuite him to ſupper, and in the morning commaunded to be ſlaine.
                  He ſlue Pompeyanus
                     
the ſonne of Lucilla, and nephue vnto Marcus Aurelius, a man of great courage in warres, and venturous in armes, whome he commaunded to be ſlaine trauelling vppon the way, and caſt foorth report that théeues had ſlaine him. Hée ſlue Papianus the learned Lawyer, who in thoſe dayes was moſt famous in knowledge and counſell, that was in all the Romane Empire: and thus it paſſed, that Baſſianus when hée came out of the Senate, did take Papianus on his right hand, and all alongeſt the ſtreate layde his righte arme vppon his ſhoulder, vntill they came vnto the entrie of the houſe at the foote of the ſtaire, where, with an axe, (ſuch as they cleaue woode,) hee commaunded his head to be cut off.
               
               
                  Hee ſlue Petronius whiche had béene Conſul, Senatour, Queſtour, Pretor, Edil, and Flamen fourtie yeares: in all whiche time, hee neuer offended any man, either any perſon had complained of him: wherefore hee was named the good Petronius. Hee ſlue Samonicus Serenus, whiche alſo was a Lawyer: and of this man it is ſaid, that in eloquence hee was very ſweete, and in writing no leſſe Satyricall.
                  
               
               
                  Alſo hee ſlue a ſonne of the Emperour Pertinax, named Elius Pertinax, who for a wonder was ſaid in Rome, that in either woord or déede, it was neuer perceiued in him, that euer in his whole life hee did ſo muche as vent for the Romane Empire: whiche was not a little to bee praiſed, and alſo meruailed: becauſe ſonnes naturally are not onely inclined to inherite their fathers goodes: but alſo to ſucceede them in their honours. Furthermore, hee commaunded a notable Romane to be ſlaine, named Chilus, becauſe hee had continually traueiled to make him friende wyth his brother Geta: whoe preſuppoſing that they came to kill him, ſtripte himſelfe cleane oute of his apparell, and eſcaped oute at a certaine windowe of his houſe.
               
               
                  He killed his firſt wife, ye daughter of Plautianus, which was exiled into Sicyl, &amp; cauſed ſearch to be made in Rome
                     
throughout the Empire, for al that were ſonnes, couſines, vnckles, nephues, or néere parentes vnto the bloud royall, all which hée commaunded to be ſlaine, both men and women: becauſe neither roote, branche, or memorie, ſhould remaine of auncient or generous bloud.
As well in Rome, as els where throughout the Empire, Baſſianus cōmaunded many others to be ſlaine: but that which was more cruell, the erecutioners had authoritie to take away their miſerable liues, but not to burie their bodies, leauing them to the foules of the ayre: as for the nobleſt, they were carried in carres on heapes, and conſumed with fire euen to aſhes. He was not onely euill and cruell, but alſo did boaſt himſelfe to be a friend of ſuch as were noted to be euil &amp; cruell: for they neuer heard him ſay well of any prince paſt, but of Silla the cruell, Brute the traitour, Catiline the tyrant, the Gracchies ſeditious, Domitian the defamed, and Commodus the diſſolute. Exactly to accompliſhe his cruelties, it chaunced on a certaine day, repreſēting the Circen playes in Rome (vnto which feaſt an huge nūber of people were come to behold) that as the guide of the imperiall chariot, might not paſſe, becauſe the ſtreats were ſtopt with multitudes of people, he began by force to make his way, and teare and treade the people: who made reſiſtance for their ſafetie, adding thereunto woordes ouer furious, as people paſſioned. And as the Emperour then being placed in the ſame chariot, although they ſaid no word to his offence, he receiued the cochemans iniurie as his owne: preſently cōmaunding al his Pretorians which there did guard his perſon, to make ſlaughter at their libertie. And as al perſons there preſent were more deckt and trimmed for the feaſt, then armed, either in redineſſe for battel: ſo great cō
                  paſſion was it to behold the multitudes of people that died there, without any offence, and ſheading of bloud of ſo many innocentes: for if tenne or twelue had offended, they were more then 15. thouſād that were there executed. The Romanes did neither eate, drincke, ſléepe, or doe any thing, but with great trembling, not doubting when they ſhould

be accuſed, but when Baſſianus ſhoulde commaunde them to be ſlaine: for neuer tyrant did execute that, which he ordinarily perfourmed in Rome: which is to wéete, without any accuſement of fiſcall, or complaint of enimie, or wante of ſeruice, to commaunde any man to be ſlaine.
            
            
               CHAP. VIII. Of the prouinces whiche Baſſianus did trauell, and the thinges which he did therein.
               AFter that Baſſianus had ſlaine his brother Geta, and his enimies, as alſo manie of his friendes, and infinite others yt were neither friends nor foes: he departed from Rome, iourneying towardes Germanie, whiche nowe is named high Almaine: with determination to viſite thoſe Prouinces, and to refourme his armies, whiche by continuance of peace, were growne to greate negligence in matters of warre. A whole ſummer hee lodged neare vnto the riuer of Danubie, where he exerciſed hunting, fiſhing, playing, running, torneying, and ſometimes ſate in iudgmente: and a matter wherein he made all men to woonder, was, that in hearing anie cauſe at the inſtant, he gaue ſentence wherein he neuer erred, and alſo iudgmente according to iuſtice. He had greate delectatiō of that countrie, and the people of the ſame, makinge choyce of the valiaunteſt and gallanteſt perſonages of the youthe of Germanie, for the guarde of his perſon. The prouinces adioyning vnto Danubie being ſet in order, he paſſed into Thracia, and from thence into the lande of Macedonia: with determinatiō to viſite the natiue countrie of Alexander the greate. All thinges wherein the actes of Alexander were grauen or painted, hee repaired, renewed, and made better: &amp; manie other thinges he did both adde and inuente, in ſuch wiſe, that in al the kingdome of Macedonie there was neither citie or temple, where he did not erecte ſome edifice, or place ſome picture or counterfeite.
               
                  
                  Baſsianus perfourmed manie notable things in Macedonia right worthy praiſe, and ſome other thinges no leſſe to be derided: becauſe in manie places he cauſed a bodie with two heads to be painted and alſo grauen, whereof one he intituled vnto him ſelfe, and the other vnto Alexander. The Macedonians did not a little ſcorne this acte, that Baſsianus woulde compare with the greate Alexander: for they eſtéemed their kinge in ſuche poſſeſſion and eſtate, that they ſay and affirme, neither anie in this life to be equall vnto him: either in the other worlde ſurmoū
                  ted of none of the Gods. Baſsianus grewe ſo proude, when he ſawe him ſelf ſo generally prayſed for his woorthy actes done in Macedonia, that he cōmaunded al his houſehoulde, not to call hym Baſsianus, but Alexander: and commaūded al the captains of his armie, to intitule thē ſelues wt the names of Alexanders auncient captaines: whereof the Romanes receiued no ſmall griefe, and al the aunciente ſeruaunts of his father were not a little diſgraced: for it ſéemed vnto them, yt ſince he did not truſt them with the garde of his perſon, he woulde not loue them, either deale with them according vnto his accuſtomed manner. Hee
woulde ofte put off all his Romaine apparrell, and cladde him ſelfe after ye 
                     Flemmiſh faſhion: and further, the more aptly to reſemble them, he woulde weare counterfeite red haire: and howe muche the more he vſed theſe thinges, ſo muche the greater was the griefe vnto the Romaines. Alſo he obſerued a cuſtome, both in eating and drinking, in his apparrell and ſeruice, as in all other trauels which all wayes followe the warres, but as a common ſouldiour. It happened manie times, that if a trench were to be made, he firſte woulde digge, carrie forth earth, marche on foote, grinde breade corne for his owne diet, and bake it vnder the aſſhes.
               
               
                  Hee delighted in baſe lodging, to reſemble the common ſoldiour, and woulde not drinke in golde or ſiluer, but in woodden tankards: finally, he did not onely abhorre all thinges that ſéemed ſuperfluous: but alſo manie times,

that which was right neceſſarie.
               
               Hee commaunded alſo, that none ſhoulde attende him, except he were commaunded, or call him Emperour, but companion: all whiche hee did to obtaine their loue, and to ſeeme admirable in his trauels. He commaunded his armie to be diuided into three partes, and the one to be called Macedonike, the other Laconike, and the thirde Spartanike, in memorie of three famous prouinces of Grecia, whiche folowed the greate Alexander in all his wars, and the people which he eſtéemed moſt valiaunt and warlike.
               From Macedonie hee tooke his way vnto Pergamus, a famous citie in Aſia, to viewe ye temple of Eſculapius: the father and founder of phyſicke, in which temple he ſlept manie nights: and as he afterwardes ſaide, receiued there manie aunſwers of ye God Eſculapius, &amp; many coūſels, as well for conſeruation of his health, as the gouernemente of his cōmō wealth. From Pergamus, Baſsianus departed to the citie Ilion, that in times paſte had beene head of the kingdome of Troy, where greate warres were long continued betwixt the Greekes and the Troyans, whiche hee founde not onelie deſtroyed, but alſo plowed and ſowen. Baſsianus did there greately deſire to burie ſome perſone, after the faſhion as in times paſt they had buried Patroclus: and for accompliſhment of his deſire, he commaunded poyſon to be giuen vnto Feſtus his priuate and fauoured ſeruaunt: whome, after he was deade, he buried there according to the faſhion whiche the Troyans vſed with Patroclus: whiche fact of his ſome excuſe, affirming that Feſtus died without Baſſianus his commaundemente. Before yt 
                  Baſsianus entred high Almaine, he would viſite Gallia Tranſalpina, &amp; after a fewe dayes of his entraunce therin, commaunded ye Proconſul of Narbona to be ſlaine: of which déede, as alſo of others which he executed he fel into ye hatred of yt cōmō people, &amp; deſerued ye name of a tyrant. In his nauigatiō frō 
                  Germanie into Aſia, he foūd him ſelf in ſo great danger, yt ye ſhip it ſelfe wherin he ſailed

did rent &amp; ſinke, &amp; he eſcaped in a litle barke. He was ſtrikē with ſo greate feare on ſea, that after he had eſcaped that daunger, he woulde oftentimes ſay: I knowe not what man hauing breade to eate, and garments to weare and couer him ſelfe on lande, woulde (to become an Emperour) go to Sea.
               
            
            
               CHAP. IX. Of an horrible crueltie that Baſſianus committed in Alexandria.
               AFter that Baſſianus had ſéene the greate Ilion, and the moſte parte of Aſia and Bithynia, he came vnto the citie of Antioche, wher he was receiued wt great ceremonie: and all the time that he remained there, no leſſe feaſted. From Antioche he tooke his way into Alexandrie, with greate deſire to ſée that famous citie, which the greate Alexander had builte: whereof the citizens beeing aduertiſed, they made moſte ſolemne &amp; coſtly preparation, wherewith to receiue him, which neuer had beene done to anie prince, either Greeke or Romaine: chiefly moued there vnto, becauſe it was ſaide, that he was a friende vnto Alexander. Manie leagues before Baſsianus came vnto the citie, they repaired the bridges, amended the high wayes, furniſhed all places with victuales, made manie ſummer houſes with boughes, and ſcattered all the wayes with flowers: and further, all his traine did take all thinges at their owne pleaſure, without paymente of anie money. But when he arriued in the citie, generally the Alexandrines came foorth to receiue him, in moſte gorgeous apparell, accompanied with inſtruments and manie kindes of muſick. Preſently at his entrie into Alexandrie, he went on foote vnto the temples: where he offered verie greate ſacrifices, and burned therein great quantities of incenſe, myrrhe, aloes, and ſuche other fumes.
               This beeing done, hee went to viſite the ſepulchre of

the greate Alexander, where he vſed an imperiall magnificence, that is to wéete, he put off a moſt rich robe wherewith he was clad, he tooke from his cappe a brooch of greate price, a curious collar from his necke, from his breſte a ſtone of value ineſtimable, and from his fingers all his rings: &amp; knéeling vpon ye ground did offer the ſame vpon the ſepulchre of the greate Alexander. Incredible was the ioy that the Alexandrines conceiued, to behold a liuing prince of Rome, to haue a Greeke prince which was deade in ſo greate veneration: in reſpect whereof, they loued him with all their hartes, and ſerued him with all their power.
               All whiche thinges Baſsianus performed, not of intente to honour Alexander, or to pleaſure the Alexandrines: but with more certintie to aſſure him ſelfe of them all, and afterwardes ioyntlie to kill them all. Manie dayes had paſt, ſince Baſsianus had borne greate hatred vnto the Alexandrines and the occaſion of his vnkindneſſe was, becauſe it was ſaide, that they ſcorned him with words, and alſo derided him in enterludes: ſaying, it was a ſcoffing matter for him to make cōpariſon wt 
                  Alexander, to name himſelfe Achilles, and to imitate Hercules. Alſo Baſsianus vnderſtoode howe they had muche deſpiſed him, for ye death of his brother Geta, &amp; laide their toungs vpon his owne mother, notinge her vnchaſtitie: which iniuries hee wanted not ſkill to diſſemble manie dayes, &amp; after to reuenge the ſame at an inſtant.
               The caſe was thus: the feaſts beeing finiſhed, he commanded proclamation to be made, that al the luſtie young men, either ſtraungers, or natiues of the countrie, ſhoulde muſter in a fielde, to the ende he would ſee, viewe, and alſo arme them after ye olde manner: ſaying, that frō thence foorth his will was, that al his men of warre ſhould fight, not after the order of the Romanes, but according to the faſhion of the Greekes.
               Greate glorie, and alſo vaine glorie poſſeſſed the Alexandrines, when they hearde theſe proclamations: and

he that might ſooneſt, came firſt into the fielde: conceiuing, that ſuch as were the wordes of the crier, ſuch ſhould be the workes of the Emperour. All the youth of Alexandria remaining in the fielde, Baſsianus with all his armie in armour iſſued forth to beholde them, and he commaunded to bring them ſelues into a ſquare, to ye end, that one by one, ſhoulde paſſe before him, of whome he woulde take his choyce and preſently after giue them armour. Nowe when the miſerable Alexandrines ſtoode all as ſheepe together vnarmed, Baſsianus gaue a ſigne vnto his ſoldiours, to giue the charge as vpon enimies: who in their ſlaughter made ſo great haſte, that within an houre, thoſe fieldes were all couered, not with flowers, but with dead bodies.
               Greate was the hurte that Baſsianus committed that day vpon the Alexandrines: for that he lefte the widowes without ſonnes, graundfathers without nephues, vnckles without couſines, brethren without brethren, and neighbours without friends: in ſuch wiſe, that none remained that was not ſlaine, or elſe tormented with the death of others. The place where Baſsianus committed this greate treaſon, and ſo inhumaine crueltie, was in a broade plaine fielde neare vnto the greate riuer Nilus: and the number was ſo greate of them which were ſlaine, that the bloude by ſtreames ranne through thoſe fieldes, and ſtayned and died that riuer Nilus: in ſuch extreme manner, that that ſo ſtately a riuer ſemed not to runne with water, but with bloude. The Alexandrines may not be excuſed of their faulte, in ſpeaking euill of Baſsianus, defameing his mother, &amp; repreſenting his vile factes in enterludes. Admitting that of euil we can ſpeake but euill, yet princes enter not into this reckoning, whoſe workes we haue licence to iudge onely in our hartes, but not with the toung to blaſpheme and deſpiſe them.
               
               And albeit the offence of the Alexandrines was verie great, yea, though it had béene much greater, yet without compariſon, muche more vehement was the crueltie that

                  Baſsianus did execute on them: which if he had bene, as he ought to haue bene, the contrarie he would haue perfourmed: for In the houſes of heroycall and excellent princes, chaſtiſement is giuen by ounces, and clemencie without meaſure.
               
            
            
               CHAP. X. Of a letter which Baſsianus did write vnto the kinge of Parthians to haue his daughter in marriage.
               IT ſéemed vnto Baſsianus, that to robbe temples, to ſacke townes, to ſubuert walles, and to kill the whole neighbourhood of Alexandrie, was but a ſmal matter, in reſpect of his vile and cruell conditions wherwith he was inclined: and to this ende he determined to attempt ſo rare and odious a treaſon, yt all men which ſhould heare or reade therof, might counte his crueltie paſt but a trifle. Euen as amongſt ſuch as be vertuous, one vertue awaketh another vertue: ſo amongſt the wicked, one euill or miſchiefe draweth with it another miſchiefe: in ſuch wiſe, that there are ſome perſons ſo vowed vnto euill and miſchiefe, that without delaie fall into the profunditie of all manner of vice and miſchiefe. The caſe was thus, that Baſsianus ſéeing himſelfe in the Eaſte partes, had a deſire to make a conqueſt of the Parthians: and for that he durſte not make them warre openly, he remembred to deuiſe a treaſon for them in ſecreate. So much more vile was the facte, as ſmall was ye occaſion which moued him to commit the ſame: for at that preſent the Parthians with the Romanes, &amp; the Romanes with the Parthians, were in greate friendſhip, and confederacie.
               Without aduice of parentes, friends, or counſelers, Baſſianus ſente a greate Ambaſſage vnto Arthabanus king of Parthia, ſending alſo manie and rich iuels, and writinge with his owne hande a letter after this manner.
               
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Baſsianus Antoninus, onely Emperour of the Romanes, to Arthabanus the greate king of Parthians, health, and good fortune. ⸫
                           The famous auncient Romanes, and many of the principall of my predeceſſours, came from the Weſt into Aſia, onely to make warre vppon this thy kingdome: but I come not to make thee warre, but to ſeek peace, and to this peace, both thou &amp; I haue to ſearch a meane, that it may be perpetuall: for otherwiſe, a iuſt warre were more ſafe for princes, then a fayned peace. As wee read in bookes, and heare of our forefathers, there is not a more briefe and ſounde waye, for greate enimies to growe to bee faithfull friendes, then by recouering newe aliance by the waye of marriage: for in true and faithfull marriages, as the married be ioyned in bodies: ſo be they lincked and confederate in heartes and mindes. Although ſome Princes haue married with the daughters of Conſuls and Senatours, and admitting they haue ſo done, I will not ſo doe: for that I was borne a prince, and am a prince, and will dye a prince: wherefore, I will not marrie but with the daughter of a Prince. When congruently or aptly it may be done, it agreeth not with the maieſtie of the Empire, that the Prince this day ſhould holde him for his father in lawe, whome he helde yeſterday for his vaſſall. Although the wiues of Princes vſe not to commaunde and gouerne, yet we muſt graunt, that when

Princeſſes be the daughters of high Princes, and deſſcended of royall bloud, the people and ſubiectes are more honoured, ſatiſfied, and pleaſed: and ſuch bring foorth children more noble and generous. The Empire of the Romanes, and the Empire of the Parthians, are two the moſte renoumed Princes throughout the whole worlde: for, notwithſtanding the one at times hath ſubdued the other: yet neuer intirely had the one lordſhip of the other. I am prince of the Romanes, and thou art Prince of the Parthians: if thou wilt marrie thy daughter with mee, with greate good will I would matche with her: and after this manner, of two diuided Empires wee ſhall make one in concorde. Theſe two Empires beeing ioyned, may there be any kingdome that will diſobey them? or any king that ſhall dare to ſaye againſt them? I demaunde not thy daughter for her beautie, for there are others muche fairer in mine Empire: neither doe I requeſt her for thy richeſſe, for I haue ſufficient, neither doe I craue her, to recouer more vaſſals: for I haue kingdomes ynough ſubiecte vnto mee. But I do it, becauſe of auncient enimies, wee might frame our ſelues immortall friendes: in ſuch wiſe, that as hitherto we haue had you in contempt, as barbarians, from hencefoorth wee ſhall behaue our ſelues as brethren.
                           Thincke not that I write thus vnto thee, by thy fauour to be reuenged of mine enimies: or, for that my kingdomes haue rebelled againſt mee (as thou ſhalte vnderſtande by theſe mine Ambaſſadours) which my father lefte vnto mee ſo plaine, and their Princes ſo dedicated to obedience, that they doe not onely accompliſhe what I commaunde them, but

alſo requeſt mee to inioyne them more.
                           If in this which I write to thee, thou thinkeſt there be deceipte, thou oughteſt alſo to conceiue, that I ſhalbee moſt deceiued: partely, for that beeing (as I am) a Romane Prince, and partely, becauſe I am the perſon whiche ſueth: for that in this marriage thou aduentureſt not more then thy daughter: but I committe vnto Fortune, mine honour, goods, and perſon. Herein I will ſaye no more, but I praye thee to receiue theſe iewelles which I ſende thee in good parte: and to that which mine Ambaſſadours ſhall ſaye, giue credite.
                        
                     
                  
               
               The king of the Parthians, after he had read this letter, and hearde the Ambaſſadours what they had to ſaye in the behalfe of Baſsianus, did aunſwer him after this manner.
            
            
               CHAP. XI. ¶Of another ſolemne letter, wherein the king of the Parthians aunſwered Baſsianus.
               
                  Arthabanus, king of the auncient kingdome of the Parthians, to Antoninus Baſsianus, the onely Romane Emperour, health, &amp; proſperitie.
               
                  Before all thinges, I giue thankes vnto the immortall Gods, becauſe they haue put into thy heart, that which thou haſt written: and that which thou with thy Ambaſſadours haſt ſent to ſaye vnto vs. By that which I haue read in thy letters, and hearde of thy Ambaſſadours, I knowe that thou beleeueſt in the Gods, and haſt not taken counſell of men: for men alwayes giue counſell vnto Princes to make warre: but the Gods alwayes perſuade them to keepe peace. Thou ſayeſt that the Romane Princes, thy predeceſſours, alwayes paſſed into Aſia, with a minde determined to make warre with the Parthians▪ but ioyntly herewith, I would thou ſhouldeſt conſider, that as the warre which ye tooke in hand againſt vs was vniuſt, ſo fortune was vnto them, alwayos vnfortunate: for it is not the will of the Gods, that by an vniuſt warre, an entire victorie ſhould be obteined. Ye Romanes tooke the enterpriſe to be Lordes of the whole worlde: and to proſecute the ſame, ye rigged foorth many nauies and fleetes, ye ioyned greate armies, conquered ſtraunge prouinces, deſtroyed many kingdomes, killed much people, robbed infinite treaſures, and aduentured your ſelues into great and immeaſurable daungers: and in the ende, that which they had obteyned, they loſt, yea, the conquerours alſo loſt them ſelues: becauſe, whatſoeuer is gotten to the preiudice of another man, is loſt to the greate hurte &amp; offence of him that obteined the ſame. That which thou promiſeſt in thy letter, and in thy name thy Ambaſſadours offer mee, I am not onely bound to accepte, but alſo deſerued greate diſpleaſure, if I durſt denie the ſame: beecauſe it is a thinge moſte iuſte, that the Goddes make warre vppon

yt prince, which refuſeth the requeſt of men in peace. Thou ſayeſt that the chiefeſt meane to cōfirme peace is, for princes to practiſe marriage betwixt thēſelues. I denie not, but that in ſome perſons it is moſte true, but it is no generall rule for all men: for we daily ſee betwixte moſte neare kinred and alies, moſte greate quarelles and ſcandals to ariſe. My greate graundfather was father in lawe vnto kinge Arſacidas, and afterwardes the one ſlewe the other in ye fielde: and ye verie ſame we heare reported to haue chaunced amongſt you: Pompey married with the daughter of Iulius, and afterwardes Iulius ouercame and deſtroyed Pompey his ſonne in lawe: in ſuche wiſe, that the marriages which they made to conſerue peace, did awake and inflame them to more cruell warre. The Prince that hath feare of the Goddes, and is naturallie giuen to peace, may not finde a better meane to obtaine the ſame, thē to be quiet in his owne realme: for, ſpeakinge the verie trueth, the prince that is ſatiſfied with his owne proper eſtate, needeth not to ſeeke affinitie in ſtraunge kingdomes. Vnto my father were offered greate, noble, and mightie mariages frō ſtraunge kingdomes: whereunto he woulde neuer conſente, either hardely indure to heare thereof: and woulde ofte ſay vnto me, that manie kinges and kingdomes he had ſeene loſt by mariage in ſtraunge countries, and therefore woulde not marrie me, but within his owne kingdome: and ſaide, at the houre of his death, that if I woulde liue manie yeares in peace, I ſhoulde not abandon my children to ſtraunge marriages.
               I had three ſonnes, whiche nowe bee all deade, and there remaineth vnto me but only one daughter,

in whome remaineth all my hope: and if the Gods would, and my deſtinies permitte, I woulde giue her an huſbande within mine owne naturall countrie, whome I might eſteeme as my ſonne, and he me as his father: for my intent, is, not to giue her an huſband that hath much goods, but in his perſon greate worthineſſe.
               To that which thou ſayeſt of the kingdoms of Parthians, &amp; the Empire of Romanes, would do verie wel to be ioyned in one: thou haſt great reaſon in that which yu ſayeſt, if it might be done with as great facilitie, as it is ſpoken: but how is it poſsible they may be made one, being (as they are) ſo ſtrange in nation? ſo diſtant in ſituation? ſo diſtinct in language? ſo diuers in lawes? and aboue all the reſte, ſo contrarie in conditions? Since betwixt you and vs, there are ſo manie landes, countries, nations, hills, and ſeas: howe is it poſsible, the bodies beeing ſo diſtante, that the harts may be vnited? Wee are much better knowne vnto the Godds, then wee knowe our ſelues: and ſince they haue created vs, and ſeparated vs, the one from the other: howe is it poſsible for vs to liue, and enioy together? for by greate diligence that men may vſe, either power that princes may practiſe, it is impoſsible for them to ſcatter that, whiche the Godds do gather together: or to ioyne that whiche they do ſeparate.
               If thou wilte haue men for thy warres, I wil ſende them! If thou wilt haue money to inrich thy treaſure, I will furniſhe thee! If yu wilt enter peace with mee, I will graunte it! If thou wilte that wee be brothers in armes, by othe I will confirme it! Finally, I excepte nothing betwixte thee and mee, but that thou

do not craue my daughter to wife: I am determined, &amp; wil not, for giuing my daughter a good marriage, leaue my countrie tributarie vnto ſtraunge people. The precious iuells and greate riches which thou ſenteſt me, I haue receiued with greate good will, and I ſende thee others, although not ſuch, either ſo riche: neuertheleſſe thou mayeſt alwayes cōceiue by them, that the kinges of the Parthians, haue greate treaſures in their keeping, and no leſſe nobleneſſe of minde to ſpende them. No more, but the Goddes be thy defence, and that thou of me, and I of thee may ſee good fortune.
            
            
               CHAP. XII. Howe Baſsianus committed a greate treaſon againſt the Parthians.
               THis letter being receiued by Baſsianus, he made ſemblance of greate ſorrowe, that the kinge of Parthians would not giue him his daughter to wife: howbeit, he ceaſed not therefore eftſones to write, &amp; ſende more preſents, to bringe to paſſe by importunities, that which of will he might not frame. Arthabanus conſidering the importunities of Baſsianus in writinge, and his largeſſe in ſending more riche iuells, not doubting yt anie guile might be concealed in that marriage, did yealde him ſelfe vnto the iudgmente of his friendes: who counſelled him, that hee ſhoulde not in anie wiſe, but accept the Emperour of Romaines for his ſonne in lawe: for it might be, that hee ſhoulde recouer him for an enimie, that would not accept him for a ſonne. The fame beeing ſpread throughout all

                  Aſia, that the kinges daughter ſhoulde marrie with the Emperour of Rome, Baſsianus aduiſed to repaire and prepare with all ſpeede: ſo that in all cities of the Parthians where he paſſed, they did not only not reſiſte him, but with greate ioy did receiue and feaſt him: for they helde it for greate vaine glorie, to ſée their princeſſe demaunded for wife by the great Emperour of Rome. In all places where Baſsianus paſſed, he offered riche ſacrifices in their temples, and gaue greate rewardes vnto ſuche as did attende and receiue him: all whiche he diſſembled, to eſcape ſuſpicion of the exceeding malice, whiche he determined to execute. Baſsianus beeing arriued at the greate citie Parthinia, where moſt times the greate kinge of Parthians was reſidente: Arthabanus iſſued foorth to receiue his ſonne Baſsianus, who moſt truly ranne foorth, as cōformable vnto peace, as Baſsianus readie and determined for the warres. There iſſued foorth with kinge Arthabanus, not only the noble and valiaunt perſonages of his houſe and courte, but alſo all the men of power and wealth of his kingdome, which againſt that day were called and did attende: in ſuch wiſe, yt by his traine ye kinge diſcouered his valure, as alſo the nobleneſſe of his people. Nowe when the Parthians beganne to ioyne with the Romaines, and of both partes greate courteſies offered, Baſsianus gaue a ſigne vnto his armed knights, to giue a charge vpon the Parthians, vpon whome they executed as greate a ſlaughter, as Hanibal at Canaſſe, and Scipio at Carthage. The kinge Arthabanus as he came in the troupe of all his royaltie, tooke his ſeruaunts horſe, and gaue him ſelfe to flight: and then as it was night, &amp; his horſe verie ſwift, he had leaſure to eſcape with his life: although not able to defende his countrie.
               This beeing donne, he ſackt the royall palace, and al the citie, and after commaunded fire to be giuen to all partes thereof, whiche he perfourmed in all cities where he paſſed, all the time that he remained in Parthia: and freely gaue licence vnto his armie, to take what they might, &amp; to kill whome they would. This was ye manner yt
                  
                  Baſſianus vſed, to ſubdue the Parthians: whiche conqueſt with more reaſon may be termed ye inuention of a traytour, then the conqueſt of an Emperour: for the innocente Parthians were rather ſolde, then ouercome. At the preſente when theſe thinges paſſed, Baſsianus did write vnto the Senate: aduertiſinge them that hee had ſubdued all prouinces and kingdomes of the Eaſte vnto the Romaine Empire: ſome by force, and others by good will: and that allthough the Romane princes, his predeceſſours, did excéede him in yeares and riches: yet not to be comparable vnto him in victories. The Senate béeing ignorante of the greate treaſon of Baſsianus practiſed againſt the Parthians (becauſe they receiued his letters, before anie other meſſenger had made reporte thereof) were verie ioyfull, and made greate feaſtes in Rome, placeing his counterfeit vpon all the gates of the citie: but after they vnderſtoode the trueth of the treaſon committed, they were ſo muche grieued with that ſo vile a deede, that if the Parthians did ſuffer, the Romanes did bewayle.
            
            
               CHAP. XIIII. How Baſsianus was ſlaine by the commaundemente of his priuate captaine Macrinus.
               THe Emperour Baſsianus beeing departed from the territories of Parthia, came vnto the prouince of Meſopotamia, which was in the moneth of October: and beeinge full of woodes wherin were bred manie wilde beaſtes, he woulde remaine in the thickeſt thereof: for that he was more giuen to chaſe in mountaines, then to hawke in fieldes.
               The captaines of Baſsianus armie were two Romanes, named Audentius, and Macrinus. Audentius was a ruſtical perſon, as concerning maters of ye cōmon wealth: but verie expert &amp; valiaunt in warrelike affaires. Macrinus
                  
contrarywiſe, in gouerning the common wealth, was wiſe and ſkilfull: but in martiall affaires, ſomewhat negligent, and not ouer fortunate. Baſſianus did like very well of Audentius, and no leſſe euill of Macrinus, and did not only wiſhe, but alſo ſaid of him much euill: murmuring that hée was negligent, a coward, vitious, an epicure, a glutton that did eate much, and drincke not a litle: and that at his comming to Rome, he would remoue him from all charge in matters of warre. Macrinus was a man very wel learned, and in his ſpeach no leſſe reformed: and in all thinges that they ſaid vnto him, touching that which Baſſianus ſhould ſpeake of him, he aunſwered: that whatſoeuer his good lord had ſaid of him, was ſpoken of great affection, not to the end to defame him as an enimie, but to correcte him as a ſonne. Although Macrinus vſed this ſpeach openly, yet he had other matter in his hart ſecretly, as afterwards in the ſucceſſe of affaires it manifeſtly appeared: for, at ſuch time as Baſſianus would haue remoued Macrinus from his honour and eſtate, Macrinus diſpatched him of his life.
               The caſe was thus, that Baſſianus being inclined of his owne proper nature, to knowe ſecretes, not onely of men, but alſo of Gods, and diuels, alwayes fearing himſelfe, that by practiſe of ſome treaſon, they would take away his life, hée was neuer void of the conuerſation of Sorcerers, ſothſayers, and inchanters, to aduertiſe him how long hee ſhould liue, and what death hee ſhould die. Not ſatiſfied with ſuch Magicians, ſothſayers, ſorcerers, and inchaunters, as did attend on his perſon in the warres, hee would ſend vnto the Prefect of Rome named Maternianus, to whome Baſſianus committed the credite of his ſecretes: writinge a letter vnto him with his owne proper hande, commaunding him, with great diligence and ſecrecie, to aſſemble Magicians, Sorcerers, Sothſayers, Inchaunters, and Aſtrologians, to know of them, not onely how long he ſhould liue, and how he ſhould die: but alſo to demaund of them, if there were any perſon within the Empire, that

deſired or procured to be Emperour. Maternianus performed all that, which his Lord Baſſianus had written vnto him: whether it were any magician or ſothſayer that ſaid it, either any enimie of Macrinus finding opportunitie for his purpoſe: Maternianus did write and aduertiſe Baſſianus, that he had aſſembled all the ſorcerers, inchanters, diuiners, magicians, ſotheſayers, aſtrologians and augurs: and that the reſolution of their counſell was, that if hee would enioy ye Empire, it were conuenient that Macrinus were ſlaine. At the inſtant when the poſt returned wt his letters from Rome, Baſſianus was placed in his coche, to go foorth on hunting: &amp; not remēbring what he had written, either preſuming what might be writtē, ſaid vnto Macrinus, that he ſhould open and read them all: and if that he found therin matter of great importance, to conſult therin: and al other ſmal matters, that he himſelfe ſhould prouide aunſwere, and diſpatch. Macrinus reading theſe letters, as wel ſuch as were written vnto Baſſianus, as vnto himſelf, came alſo to read the letter of Maternianus, wherin he aduertiſed Baſſianus of the aunſwere which the magicians had giuen him, which is to ſay, that preſently it were conuenient that Macrinus ſhould be put to death: whereof he was not a litle abaſhed, holding it for great good hap, that this ſecrete had chaunced into his onely handes, before any other perſon: for, at the inſtant that Baſſianus might haue read this letter, he would haue cōmaunded Macrinus his head to flée from his ſhoulders. Macrinus doubting, that Maternianus might returne to write of the former matter vnto Baſſianus, and that, were it but for cōcealing that letter, hee would ſhorten him by the ſhoulders, aduiſed to practiſe the death of Baſſianus, before he ſhould experiment the ſame on him. Amongeſt them that garded the perſon of Baſſianus, there was one Martianus, who accordingly had a brother alſo of his guard (him for a ſmall diſpleaſure Baſſianus commaunded to be ſlaine) and with Martianus vſed woords of great deſpite: in ſuch maner, that Martianus wt thoſe woords remayned diſgraced, &amp; of his brothers death

gréeued and afflicted. After Macrinus vnderſtoode this paſſion to reigne in Martianus againſt Baſſianus, hee firſt entered with him in familiaritie, and gaue him ſiluer and gold, receiued him into his friendſhip, and euery day lead him into remembrance of the vniuſt death of his brother: to the ende hee ſhould not growe cold, but hote in hatred againſt Baſſianus. Now when Macrinus felt, that by his benefits he had recouered Martianus for his faithful friēd, and brought him into great diſdaine and mortall hatred of Baſſianus, he grew to cōpoſition to depriue him of his life, for which déede, his reward ſhould be great: whereof Martianus did take great delighte, and bound himſelfe to performe the ſame: partly to reuenge the death of his brother, as alſo to condeſcend vnto the requeſt of his friend Macrinus. Baſſianus being reſident in Careuca a citie of Meſopotamia, came foorth to viſite a temple of the Goddeſſe Luna, two miles diſtant from the citie: and being conſtrayned vppon the way, to vnburden his bellie, hee entered the thickeſt of the couert, accompanied but with one ſeruaunt: and Martianus that attended but opportunitie to accōpliſh his promiſe, entered vppon Baſſianus being withdrawen into the thickeſt of the ſhrubs, proſecuting his neceſſitie al alone, Martianus ſtrake him with a launce downe flat vppon the ground: which wound was ſo mortall, that without more woordes, or ſtrength to moue, where the launce went in, the life came out. After that Martianus had ſlaine Baſſianus, he toke his horſe and fled: but as the imperiall guard was at hand, within a leage he was ouertaken, and ſlaine with launces: in ſuch wiſe, that after hee had taken reuengmēt of his enimie, he enioyed his life but one hour. This was the end of the vnhappie Emperour Baſſianus, whoſe life did merite a ſlaunderous death: for that it was not vnreaſonable, that he which had kild ſo many friends, by treaſon ſhould be ſlaine with enimies.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XIIII. ¶How Macrinus excuſing himſelfe of the death of Baſſianus, did aduaunce himſelfe with the Empire.
               ON the ſelfe ſame day that Antoninus Baſſianus was borne, which was the eight of April, he was ſlaine, xliiij. yeares of his age being accompliſhed, and vj, yeares of his Empire and reigne expired. The firſt man that came vnto him after he was ſlaine, was Macrinus, who bewailed his death with ſo great diſſimutation, as if he had not béene the mā that procured ſo vile a déede. Macrinus was right fortunate that Martianus was ſlaine when hee was taken: for all men thought and alſo ſaid, that Martianus had ſlaine his Lord Baſſianus, not by inducemente of any perſon, but to reuenge his brothers death. Many others were of this conſpiracie beſids Macrinus, that ordeyned it, and Martianus that ſought ye ſame: yt is to ſay Nemeſianus &amp; his brother Apolinarius, Renonuus &amp; Agrippa, al which had ſworn his death: ſome for iniuries which they had receiued, &amp; others for ſeruice vnrecompenced. Preſently vppon Baſſianus his death, Macrinus commaunded his body to be burnt, and his aſhes to be placed in a coffin of gold: &amp; ſo with great gard, and no leſſe accompanied, hee ſente the ſame vnto Iulia his mother in law, being then at Antioch: who at the inſtante when ſhe vnderſtoode Baſſianus to be dead, dranke a litle poiſon, wherewith ſhe finiſhed her life. The caſe ſtāding in this eſtate, newes arriued at the Romaine campe, that Arthabanus king of Parthians purſued Antoninus Baſſianus, to execute vengeance for the iniurie which he had receiued: and to the ſame end, the king &amp; his knightes, before they came to the field, made a vowe vnto their Gods, neuer more to returne with life, before they had ſlaine the Emperour Baſſianus. The Romanes beheld themſelues in great confuſion, on the one parte, findeing themſelues in ſo ſtraunge a Countrie wythout

hope of ſuccour, and alſo for the death of their prince and their enimie ſo néere at hand: to repaire and remedie which miſchiefe, with great diligence they elected a prince named Audentius, a man of honeſt life, and of great experience in the warres: which he refuſed, alledging for himſelfe, age and ſickeneſſe: and that of his election hee might not gather but trauel &amp; offence vnto the common wealth. Two dayes was the armie without an Emperour, and in the end vppon Audentius his refuſall, they elected Macrinus for Emperour, which election did rather procéed of neceſſitie, then of will: becauſe their Parthian enimies were very néere, &amp; the worthie perſons of the Empire very farre.
Aboue wée made mention of Iulia, the mother in law vnto Baſſianus: this Ladie being a widowe, and reſident in the Court, in the ſummer time Baſſianus beheld her at a feaſt, as ſhe was, halfe naked, and inflamed with her loue ſaid vnto her theſe words. If it were poſſible to renounce this name mother, which I owe thee: from henceforth I would call thee wife. Iulia aunſwered: If thou wilt, thou mayeſt, becauſe princes haue authoritie to make lawes, but are not bound to obſerue them. And as in Baſſianus loue did abound; ſo finding in Iulia a readie minde, preſently he married with her: in ſuch wiſe, that vnto patricide he added inceſt: that is to ſay, that hauing ſlaine his brother Geta, alſo he married his fathers wife.
               
               
                  Baſſianus naturally was euil inclined: and if his father were cruell, he was moſt cruell: in eating diſordinate, in drincking vntemperate: for many times in his exceſſe of drinke, he would talke at large. From his infancie he was hated of all perſons, no leſſe of his owne, then of ſtrangers, the Pretorian knights onely excepted: which was not for the benefites, that of him they had receiued: but for the libertie which he gaue them to robb and ſteale. Some notable buildinges hee erected in Rome, eſpecially certaine ſtately bathes, which hee named after his owne name, in coſt and curiouſnes excéeding all workes and buildinges in Rome. He made alſo a gate in Rome, &amp; called it Seueriana,
                  
in the reuerence of the name of his father Seuerus: wherin he cauſed to be grauen al the victories and triumphes that his father had obteined, either after or before he was Emperour. Hee was the firſt that brought vnto Rome the image of the Goddeſſe Iſis: vnto whome he edified a ſumptuous temple, and therein did conſtitute prieſtes. He left no child either legitimate or not legitimate, but Heliogabalus, whom he had by a néece of his mother Iulia, of whom we will ſpeake in the hiſtorie following.

               CHAP. I. ¶Of the linage and nouriture of the Emperour Heliogabalus.
               
                  THE ſecond wife of Seuerus was named Iulia, which was mother vnto Geta, and mother in lawe vnto Baſſianus: this Iulia, when ſhe was married vnto Seuerus, brought vnto Court with her an elder ſiſter, named Meſia, a woman of proportion ſufficient faire and comely, but of condition very wilie. This Meſia had with her two daughters, whereof the elder was named Semiamira, and the yonger Manea: both borne in the Emperour Seuerus his Courte, and bred and nouriſhed a long time after in the houſe of the Emperour Baſſianus. The writers of thoſe times do not name, who was the huſband of Meſia, and the father of Semiamira, &amp;

of Manea: and therefore doubted to be conceiued in adulterie, or that the father was of linage obſcure.
               
                  Meſia remayning in the Court of Seuerus with her two daughters, being young &amp; very faire, Baſſianus the ſonne of Seuerus had acceſſe vnto Semiamira, and begate of her a ſonne named Antoninus Caracalla: and for the loue of Iulia his aunt, and alſo to the end the damoſell ſhould not bee deſpiſed in the ſighte of Seuerus, the graundmother vſed ſo great ſkill in this buſines, that no perſon of the Courte might perceiue the daughter to be with child, or brought a bed: or whether ye child was put foorth to be nourſed. The auncient linage of this womā 
                  Meſia, was of Phoenicia, &amp; borne ſhe was in a citie called Meſania, néere vnto whiche place (in times paſt) a battell had béene fought, betwéene ye 
                  Rhodians and the Phoenicians. Antoninus Caracalla on the fathers ſide, was ſonne vnto the Emperour Baſſianus, and on the mothers ſide ſonne of Semiamira: and conceiued in adulterie. Whē ye child was fiue yeares of age, he was brought vnto the Courte, and there bred &amp; nouriſhed with the mother and graundmother: but all the dayes that Baſſianus liued; they neuer durſt ſay that it was his ſonne: becauſe Iulia his aunt and mother in lawe to Baſſianus, had married with the ſelfe ſame Baſſianus: and if ſhe had knowen the child to be ſuch, ſhe would haue ſlaine it, baniſhed her Néece, &amp; ſent away her ſiſter. This woman Meſia was ſo wiſe, &amp; prouident, that in the reigne of Seuerus, at Court all men did ſerue her, &amp; after in the dayes of Baſſianus ſhée commaunded and gouerned all thinges at her owne pleaſure: and this was in ſuch extréeme wiſe, yt with her he did take counſel for the affaires of the cōmon wealth, and ſhée did alwayes accompanie him, whither ſoeuer he went out of Rome, although it were vnto the warres. This Meſia was frank of ſpeach, &amp; of no great reformation of life, howbeit very ſkilful in al things which ſhe aduentured to take in hand: for, notwtſtanding al men had of her great ſuſpiciō, yet they were fewe yt atteyned vnto her ſecrete drifts. Although on the one part, ſhe was accuſed to be lewd &amp; loaſe

of life, yet on the other ſhée was praiſed, becauſe ſhée was very wiſe in all thinges wherein ſhe gaue counſell: which moſt clearely appeared, for that in the 16. yeares in which ſhe remained in the Courte and manours of thoſe princes (who by her iudgement and opinion were gouerned) ſhée was neuer ſéene to twite or reproue any perſon with her tongue: or giue counſel in any thing that offended the common wealth. Being (as ſhe was) ſiſter vnto Iulia the Empreſſe, and ſo accepted with thoſe princes, this Meſia was marueilous riche: and the cauſe thereof was, that all good thinges which were vacant in the Empire ſhe craued, and whatſoeuer was giuen her ſhee receiued. The ſecond daughter of this Meſia, named Manea, maried with a Cō
                  ſul named Verius, and brought him forth a ſonne, then named Alexius, but afterwards Alexander the Emperour: in ſuch wiſe, that this Meſia had one ſiſter, an Empreſſe: &amp; ſawe her two nephues Emperours. Meſia doubting that ſome day it might come to the notice of Iulia her ſiſter, that Antoninus Caracalla was the ſonne of her huſband Baſſianus, aduiſed to ſend both her nephues vnto her owne proper
countrie of Phoenicia, there to hold them more ſafe, and better taught. In the prouince of Phoenicia was a moſt ſumptuous temple, dedicated vnto the God Heliogabalus, the woorkemanſhip whereof was wrought all of ſawen ſtone, as if it had béene timber, in the ioyning whereof their appeared no ſeame, but all mē iudged (that knew not that ſecrete) that the whole temple had béene made of one ſtone. There was not in that temple, as was in other tē
                     ples, which is to wit, any image or ſimulachre of any God: but that which it conteyned, was a blacke ſhining ſtone, great &amp; large beneath, and vpwards more narrow, wherein was grauen the Sunne and the Moone, right curiouſly &amp; ſubtily, which in viewe and beholding did dazill the eyes of men. The people of Phoenicia did report, that the temple was made by mans hand, but the ſtone was ſent by the Gods from heauen: for which cauſe they offered vpon the ſame, ſiluer, gold, iewels, and other great riches: and it

was viſited, not onely by the natiues of Phoenicia, but alſo from many partes of Aſia.
                  
               
               
                  In that temple, there were not onely prieſtes, but alſo Philoſophers: to the ende that ſome ſhould ſacrifice, and others teache and refourme maners: becauſe that temple was indued with ſo great riches, that there was ſufficient both for the one &amp; the other. Heliogabalus being of ye age of xiiii. yeres, and his couſin Alexius of the age of twelue yeares, their graundmother Meſia placed them in that temple, to enure them to offer ſacrifices, &amp; to learne Philoſophie. Theſe two brethren went apparailed after the manner of two Prieſtes, which is to wéete, in ſhirtes of Linſey woolſey, their garments of gold and cotton, their ſléeues buttoned with Corrall, their robes trailing, their heades couered with ſilke calles, about their neckes collars of golde, their féete bare vppon the inſtep, leaden ringes vppon their little fingers, and ringes of golde vpon their thumbes: but aboue al the reſt, they might not eate but in their houſes: either ſléepe but in their temples. And becauſe Antoninus was Prieſt, and brought vp in the temple of the God Heliogabalus, that is to ſaye, a Prieſt of the Sunne, he was afterwardes named Antoninus Heliogabalus: and alſo many dayes after that he was exalted vnto the height of the Empire, he kepte the garments, and receiued the ſtipend of his auncient prieſthood. Heliogabalus was of meane ſtature, redde haired, white faced, ſmall mouthed, ſhorte legged, and largely, bearded: and as at that time he was young and faire, and his ſacerdotall veſtmentes did ſo adourne him: although the ſecrete of his parentage was vnknowen, yet all men preſuppoſed that he was of noble bloud.
               
            
            
               CHAP. II. ¶Howe capteine Macrinus did exalt him ſelfe with the Empire, after the death of Baſsianus.
               
                  AFter that Martianus had ſlaine Baſsianus his Lorde, through the counſell of Macrinus, preſently he exalted him ſelfe, or (to ſaye better) did tyrannize the Empire: neuertheleſſe, the armies elected him, and the Romanes allowed him: not becauſe they were pleaſed with Macrinus, but for ioy to ſée them ſelues frée and deliuered of Baſſianus.
               
               So generall was the ioye amongeſt the Romane people, to ſée Baſsianus dead, that they cared not to conſider of Macrinus that ſhould ſuccéede, whether he were good or bad: becauſe, heartes that be tormented, and men that be deſpighted, when they hap to oppreſſe their enimies, conſider not ſo much of their profite, as they reſpect their reuengement. Tenne dayes after Macrinus ſawe him ſelfe Emperour, Arthabanus king of the Parthians gaue him battell, to reuenge the iniurie which Baſsianus had done vnto him: this battell betwixt both partes was ſo contended and ſo bloudie, that the victorie on that daye remained on neither ſide: yet leaſt was the loſſe vnto the Romanes. Arthabanus being aduertiſed of the death of his enimie Baſsianus, and his choler alſo ſomewhat alaide, made peace with the Romanes, and with his armies retired into his countrie. After Macrinus behelde him ſelfe elected, and confirmed Emperour, and king Arthabanus returned vnto his kingdome, and that in all Aſia, not ſo much as a lance in the reſt againſt him, he departed to the citie of Antioche: not of any intent to refourme his armie, but of purpoſe totally to vowe him ſelfe vnto vice and filthineſſe.
               The caſe was thus, that being ſetled in Antioche, he gaue héede vnto no other matter, but to the vſe of the Bathe, trimming his head, annoynting his bearde, going on hunting, proſecuting gluttonie and exceſſe, giuing him ſelfe vnto women: and that which was woorſt, he fledde from affaires, and followed vices.
               When at any time Macrinus did iſſue foorth, to viewe

his men of warre, he walked not with a lance, but with a Caane in his hande, which they helde for no ſmall iniurie: for that amongeſt them it was a lawe, that none might paſſe through their bandes except he were armed, with ſome armour.
               It was a lawe muche vſed and obſerued amongeſt the Romanes, that their Princes did neuer enter armed into the Senate, either vnarmed did viewe their Campes and armies: ſince in the one they did manage matters of peace, and in the other nothing but warres.

                     Macrinus heard by reporte, that the good Marcus Aurelius ſpake ſildome, and with lowe voice: and ſo he vſed for reſemblance to aunſwere ſuters, with fewe woordes, and verie baſe: in ſuch wiſe, that in his ſpeache he did imitate Marcus Aurelius, and in his life did reſemble Nero.
                  
With none of the Antiochians, either with any perſon of all Aſia, did he conſent to haue conference, or to be ſerued at his table, either enter into his chamber, or ſléepe in his houſe: but after the manner of a tyraunt, with his owne he ſtoode vppon his guarde, and with ſtraungers not a little ſuſpicious.
               
                  Auncient perſons, his olde horſemen, and the Capteines of his armies, he woulde not commaund to ſtande vp, although they had long continued vppon their knées: either to put on their cappes, when they ſtoode bareheaded: wherein, the Romane Princes alwayes vſed greate meaſure and conſideration: for that curteſie coſteth little, and profiteth much.
               
               The money which Macrinus receiued of his rents, or were preſented him from the cities, he conſumed them all in vices: and on the other parte, he woulde neither paye what he owed, or ſuccour his men of warre: in ſuche wiſe, that the people ſtoode in deſpaire, and the armies (for want of paye) no leſſe deſpighted.
               The Romanes were afflicted with no ſmall griefe, to beholde the tyraunt Macrinus in all his déedes and attempts, and to ſée howe the Aſians deſpiſed him: for they

frankely ſaide, that he did not inherite, but they did electe him Emperour: and their fact to be imputed with greater indignitie, that had choſen a perſon of ſo great vnworthineſſe. In his apparell, in his diet, and in all his manners and faſhions, Macrinus would néedes imitate, not the Romanes, but the Aſians: which the Romanes receiued with great griefe, and the Aſians with no leſſe ignominie: for that ſo euil a perſon would néedes reſemble thē. For ſo muche as there were no warres in Aſia, or in all the Eaſt, either by Sea or lande, the Romane armies would haue returned to Rome, but Macrinus would not conſent: doubting (as they were diſcontented) that they ſhould ioyne with the Senate, and determine to depoſe him from the Empire. Macrinus was muche blamed, for that he ſtayed to go to Rome: and much more, for want of pay vnto his men of warre: for that many times, more
hurt redoundeth to Princes by holding their armies diſcontented, then to encounter their armed enimies. In very ſhort ſpace Macrinus had recouered mortall hatred of his armies: of the one parte, to be ſo abſolute a tyraunt, and on the other parte, to be in vice ſo diſſolute, and alſo ſo much puffed vp with pride: for that he ſéemed to extoll himſelfe by commaunding, and loathed and deſpighted with ſuites of his ſubiectes.
                  
                     Macrinus was a man of
a lowe ſtature, quarellous, ambitious, and alſo couetous: but ioyntly herewith, he was valiant in the field, and yet woulde ſéeke great meanes to liue in peace: &amp; notwithſtā
                     ding all theſe conditions, both good and euil, they woulde neuer haue taken away his life and Empire, if he had not béene nummed with the vices of Aſia.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. III. ¶Howe the great matrone Meſia bought the Empire for her nephue Heliogabalus.
               
                  IN the time that Macrinus was reſident in Antioche, the Romane hoſts, were in defence of the prouince of Phoenicia: becauſe in that yere, that coūtrie did abound in grain for bread, and the people alſo were not fatigate or ſpent with warres. Wée haue ſaid, how in that countrie, there was a temple dedicated vnto the God Heliogabalus: which in buildings was verie magnificent, and of prieſts much populated. Many Romane captaines, went many times to viſite that temple: ſome to ſée, ſome to pray, and ſome to offer ſacrifices: for that, naturally, the Romanes preſumed to be great worſhipers of their gods, and to hold their tēples in ſingular reuerēce. Ther was in thoſe daies, in thoſe temples, two young prieſtes firſt couſins: one of whiche was named Heliogabalus, and the other Alexius: theſe yong men, in their veſtments which they did weare, and in their life which they did leade, were iudged to bée prieſtes: one the other part, they well ſéemed by their grauitie, to bée the ſonnes of princes. The matrone Meſia was ſo diſcreet, ſecret, and aduiſed, that the children being of the age of fiftéene yeres, neither them ſelues, or any other for them, did either knowe, or ſuſpect, who were their fathers, either who their grandmother: but that ſhée ſayd vnto all men, that thoſe children were orphans, and ſonnes vnto her auncient ſeruaunts. When Macrinus did tyrannize ye empire, amongſt other errors which hee committed, hée baniſhed the famous matrone Meſia from the courte: not for that hee did ſo much as ſuſpect her of any euill, but béeing therunto vrged by his vile inclination: for that all princes, his predeceſſors, eſtéemed her as a mother, and honored her as a ladie of great ſouereigntie.
In the courte of eight emperours, by the ſpace of 53. yeres, the great matrone Meſia had béene reſident, with all which ſhée vttered of her ſelfe ſo great valure, and yealded ſuch eſtimation of her perſon, and alſo of them recouered ſo great gaine, that when Macrinus did reiect her from the court, ſhe had more riches in her exile, thē 
                     Macrinus might finde in the whole empire.
               
               
                  The matrone Meſia departed vnto Phoenicia, where her two nephues remained, namely Heliogabalus, and Alexius: and as there remained manie Romane gentlemen euill payed and worſe pleaſed, ſo they ioyned with Meſia, and Meſia with them, to talke and murmur howe Macrinus had ſlaine, by treaſon, his lorde the Emperour Baſsianus, and made hauock of the Empire &amp; common wealth: whiche matter was moued amongſt perſons that had deſired to remoue this miſchief, and on the tyrante alſo to take vengeance. The matrone Meſia receiued excéeding ioy, to heare with her owne eares, and ſee with her eyes, howe all the armie was bente againſt the tyrant Macrinus: and their greateſt care was, to finde a man ſufficient, and of merite meete for the Empire: becauſe the Romanes ſtoode with him in great and cruel hatred, for want of pay, and the matrone Meſia no leſſe grieued with her exile. The matrone Meſia beholding her ſelfe in ſo good &amp; apt aſſembly, to make her nephue Heliogabalus Romane Emperour, called in great ſecrecie, ſixe Romane captaines of the chiefeſt of the armie: all which were of great authoritie, and no leſſe grauitie. Vnto theſe ſixe captaines Meſia ſayd in ſecrete, howe her nephue Heliogabalus was ſonne vnto the Emperour Baſsianus, and Semiamira her daughter: and that ſhée had helde him hidden in Aſia, for doubt of ye Empreſſe Iulia: who (had ſhe knowne it) would haue ſlaine the childe, and baniſhed the mother. Meſia was not only ſatiſfied to ſay &amp; certifie theſe vi. captaines, that the Emperour Baſsianus moſt truely was father vnto that younge man, and nephue vnto her ſelfe: but ioyntly therewith, ſhe brought them into her chamber, and diſcouered vnto them an huge maſſe of golde &amp; ſiluer, whiche ſhe promiſed, and ſware vpon the altars of the temple, to diſtribute totally vpon the armie, if they woulde giue the Romaine Empire vnto her nephue.
               Vnto theſe ſixe captaines (to whome the matrone Meſia had committed this ſecreate, and diſcouered this treaſure) ſhee both promiſed and ſware, to bringe to paſſe

with her nephue Heliogabalus, that he ſhoulde giue them the moſte honourable offices in all the Empire, if in caſe they ſhoulde vſe the meane to make him Emperour: in ſo muche that, if other men were payed and recompenced, they ſhoulde remaine both remunerated and honoured. Greate wiſdome was vſed by the matrone Meſia, in this matter of ſo greate importance, eſpecially in the choyce of ſo honourable captaines: whoſe credite was ſufficient to frame the whole armie to perfourme the ſame. Of this example, princes and greate potentates may collecte, that in anie affaires, there is not greater daunger, either more ſafetie, then ſoundly to conſider, in to whoſe hands they commende their cauſes.
               
               The Pretorian bands being euill intreated, and worſe payde, great was their ioy, when they hearde that Heliogabalus was ye ſonne of Baſsianus, for whom the grandmother craued the Empire: whome they all accepted, and bound them ſelues to receiue for their Emperour: not only to be reuenged of ye tyrant Macrinꝰ, but alſo to poſſeſſe the money. For ſo much as the temple where he was Prieſt, was without the citie, agréement was made betweene the matrone Meſia, and the armie, that preſently the ſame night (notwithſtanding it were verie late) both her nephue and alſo her owne perſon, by ſtrēgth and deuiſe ſhould be conueyed ouer the wall into the citie, that at the breake of day, they ſhoulde ſeaze the citie, and aduaunce Heliogabalus vnto the Empire. Neither was the matrone Meſia ſlack to acompliſh their requeſt, either was there anie wante in the promiſe made by the Pretorians: but that Meſia and her nephue approching to the foote of the wall, wt purpoſed engins mounted them ouer into the citie: the young man being placed amids the Romaine captaines, beléeuinge him to be the ſonne of Baſſianus, by reſemblance of his face, and by a marke in his hande, as Baſsianus had.
               The Romane armies receiued greate ioy, to beholde Meſia and her nephue Heliogabalus: chiefly, to ſee the

young man ſo comely, faire, and towarde: and in beholding they would all ſay, that ſince he had ſo good a face, neceſſarily it followed, that his déedes ſhoulde be vertuous: but his inclination beeing diſcouered, there was no vice wherein he was not noted: either any vertue wherefore to be praiſed. The great matrone Meſia (as a woman that dealt in affaires both daungerous and eſcandalous) would firſt aſſure the Empire vnto her nephue, before ſhée departed from her treaſure: and the caſe was thus. Shée framed all the principals of the armie, preſently to ſweare vnto Heliogabalus, as their onely Emperour, &amp; to kiſſe his hande as their naturall Lorde. A matter moſt truely verie marueilous, and no leſſe worthie to be commended vnto memorie, namely, the diſpatche and diligence vſed by Meſia in one night: moſte manifeſtly apparant, that within ſixe houres, ſhée brought forth her nephue from the temple, paſſed him ouer the wall, did yeald him credite to be the ſonne of Baſsianus, obteined their othes as vnto their Emperour, kiſſed his hand as loyall ſubiectes, diuided her treaſure amongſt the armies, fortified them ſelues in the fortes of the citie, and brought the whole hoſte into armour. At the breake of daye, in euery tower they did ſound their trumpets, placed their Standards and Pendons, bothe on bulworkes and corteines, and with loude voices exclaimed through all ſtreates: Viua, viua el Emperador Heliogabalo, hiio del buen Baſsiano: that is to ſaye: happie and long life vnto the emperoure Heliogabalus, ſonne to the good Baſſianus. This béeing done &amp; proclaymed, Heliogabalus came foorth into the citie, neither on foote or on horſe backe, but vppon the ſhoulders of the moſte auncient and honourable of the armie, wearing the imperiall crowne vppon his head, and holding the royall ſcepter in his hande, and haueing vppon his ſhoulders, the enſigne of Auguſta, &amp; before him the pendon of the Eagle: becauſe theſe were the enſignes whereby the emperours of Rome were knowen. And now, after ye ſtandards were placed, and the ſtrength of the citie poſſeſſed, the armie

publiquely proclaimed, and receiued the Emperour Heliogabalus for their lorde and Emperour: preſently, the renowmed matrone Meſia did yelde vnto them all her treaſure, both ſiluer and golde, without breache of any promiſe, or reſeruing of any one Iewell. The Romanes were ſo contented with the matrone Meſia, that there they did both ſweare and vowe, to eſtéeme her as a mother, to hold Heliogabalus for their Lorde, and to perſecute the tyrant Macrinus, euen to death.
               
            
            
               CHAP. IIII. ¶Howe Macrinus did write a letter vnto the renowmed Meſia, after he vnderſtoode his depriuation of the Empire.
               THE tyrant Macrinus was ſettled with greate ſecuritie, in the citie of Antioche, when they remoued him from the Empire in Phoenicia: for ſo it hath béene, is, and ſhalbe, that when Princes moſte greedily doe proſecute vices, then their enimies are weauing ſome webb of moſt deadly daunger. Heliogabalus was not the full age of ſeuentéene yeres when he was aduaunced to the Empire: when Macrinus in Antioche heard the newes of yt whiche was don in Phoenicia, he fell into a great laughter, &amp; made a ieſt of it: chiefely, being certified to be ſo very a childe, &amp; framed by his grandmother Meſia, whome he helde bothe for a woman ambitious, and alſo contentious. Thoſe perſons that remained with Macrinus (after they hearde of a newe Emperour, &amp; that ye 
                  Romane hoſts had don him homage and fealtie) aduiſed &amp; alſo prayed him, that he would not eſtéeme the matter ouer light, but with better and riper counſell, ſhould thinke and conſider for the remedie thereof: for it might come to paſſe, by conceiuing it to be but a ieſt, that the other might remaine Emperour in earneſt.
               
                  As Macrinus naturally was both ambitious, orgulous, and diſdaineful: ſo he demaunding ynke and paper, preſently did write a cholerike letter with his own hands, vnto the famous matrone Meſia after this maner.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Macrinus Ancius, onely Emperour and vniuerſall Lord, to the matrone Meſia her perſon, ſmall health, and leſſe grace with the Gods.
                           Here I am aduertiſed, that in the offence of the Gods, &amp; vnto my great want of reuerence, thou haſt attempted with mine armies, to eſtabliſh a newe Emperour: which deede exactly declareth thee to be (as in deede thou art) a woman both ſeditious, and alſo ambitious: ſince thou knoweſt that by meanes of thy toung and mutinie in the common wealth, I did baniſhe thee my houſe. Alſo they ſaye, that the emperour which thou haſt made, is a boye, a prieſt, a baſtard, and thy nephue: whereunto there is no more to be aunſwered, but that I ſhal chaſtice thee as a woman, and him as a childe: that is to ſaye, commaund him to be whipt, &amp; thy ſelfe to ſpinne. I ſweare vnto thee Meſia (by the immortall Gods) that if thou driue mee to take my lance in hand, I will force thee to put thy diſtaffe vnder thy girdle: for vnto women (ſuch as thou) it were more honeſtie to be ſpinning, then to practice mutinies amongſt ſouldiours. Alſo it is ſaide vnto me, that thou haſt giuen infinite treaſures vnto mine armies, to moue them to reuolt from mee, and to elect thy nephue Emperour: theſe with the reſt, be the fruites of thy guyle: for that only

of thee, and neuer of any other, it is ſaide, or ſhall be ſaide, that thou haſt robbed the Empire, to buy the Empire.
                           If all princes paſt had knowen thee as I do knowe thee, neither would they haue giuen credite vnto thy woordes, or faith vnto thy fained workes: but as by thy guileful diligence in their ſeruice, and preſuming attempts in their affaires, thou didſt commaund their houſholdes, and gathered the fruites of their goodes. I haue heard thee many times boaſt thy ſelfe, that thou waſt borne in the houſe of Marcus Aurelius, nouriſhed with Antoninus Pius, and didſt dwell in houſe with Commodus, Pertinax, Iulianus, and Seuerus, Princes very glorious: which if thou hadſt remembred, thou wouldeſt neuer haue committed a deede ſo vile: for there may not be in the whole worlde a deede more vnſeeming, then for him that was bred in the palace of kings, to committ treaſon againſt a perſon of ſuch maieſtie. If it ſhall hap the Gods to permitt, and my ſorrowfull deſtinies ſo to direct, that in this enterpriſe I loſe both honour and life, I can ſaye vnto thee Meſia, that which hiſtoriographers, who ſhall write of thee and mee, with trueth may ſaye, that the Empire came vnto mee by election, but to thine through treaſon. If thou hadſt beene a woman of honeſtie or honour, thou wouldſt not ſo openly haue defamed thy daughter Semiamira, whome thou chargeſt to haue accompanied Baſſianus, and of her bodie this boye Heliogabalus to haue ſproung, for whome nowe thou procureſt the Empire: becauſe in the houſes of bluſhing faces, generous and noble heartes, they more eſteeme an ounce of honour, then all the wealth and eſtate of this life.

Oh Meſia, howe greate an errour haſt thou made in this thine enterpriſe, onely to reuenge thy rauenous heart, and to make thy nephue an Emperour? namely, thou haſt raiſed a ſlaunder vppon Baſsianus, defamed the royal palace of inceſt, diſhonoured thine vnchaſt daughter Semiamira, blemiſhed the Empreſſe Iulia of vnhoneſt conſent, &amp; not ſtained but imbrued thine owne fame, with the filthie couerture of inceſtuous adulterie. And ſince Baſsianus, Iulia, Semiamira, and Seuerus haue ended their dayes: wherefore wilt thou (oh traytreſſe Meſia) diſhonour ſo many that be dead, to honour but one that is aliue? Nowe I knowe (oh Meſia) howe tedious and perilous it is, for quiet men to deale with mutinous women, and paſsioned as thou art: who hauing no yron to hurte our fleſhe, yet committeſt deedes to defame vs, and ſpeakeſt woordes to torment vs. Of this treaſon which thou haſt committed againſt me, I doubt not to be reuenged, and my heart throughly ſatiſfied: for ſo greate an offence is treaſon, that if it be in men to offende therein, the Gods haue onely charge to reuenge ye ſame. It is giuē me alſo to vnderſtand, that this thy nephue was a prieſt in the temple of the God Heliogabalus: in which matter I do not entermedle and ſay little, ſince in this iniurie ye haue not committed offence vnto men, but vnto the gods: but ioyntly therewith I dare ſaye vnto thee, that ſince thou haſt drawen him foorth of the temple, where he was conſecrated vnto the Gods, thou ſhalt neuer enioy good dayes of him: for that of thy parte, to haue done ſeruice vnto the Goddes, of Princes thou ſhouldeſt haue made prieſtes, and not of prieſts Princes.
                           
                              The Gods demaund nothing which we haue, but if by chaunce wee offer any thing vnto them, they like it not, that wee ſhould returne to take it awaye: for which cauſe I ſay vnto thee, and from hencefoorth, do prophecie (O Meſia) that for ſo muche as thou haſt drawne foorth thy nephue from the holy temple, he ſhall loſe the Empire, and thou thy money. The confidence which thou committedſt vnto the men of warre, by diuiding amongeſt them ſo greate quantitie of golde and ſiluer, I hope in the immortall Gods, ſhall all conclude in ſmoke: for it is an auncient cuſtome among the Romane hoſtes, not to giue the Empire to the perſon of moſte merite, but vnto him that payeth beſt. The matter that moſte grieueth mee (O Meſia) in this traiterous enterpriſe, is, to thinke, that I being a man, and a Romane prince, muſt deale, fight, and contende with a woman: becauſe there may not bee in this whole worlde an equall deſpight, then for a man to arme him ſelfe againſt a woman, whoſe weapons are but woordes. But the concluſion ſhalbe, ſince thou waſt borne in the palace of the good Marcus Aurelius, and Heliogabalus being thy nephue, if thou wilt be remoued from this follye, and reduce thy ſelfe into my ſubiection and obedience, I will relieue thee of this exile, and to thy nephue Heliogabalus will I giue a Conſulſhip: and if not, wee are come vnto the time, that men muſt doe what they may, and the Gods as they pleaſe.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. V. Of a letter written by the great matrone Meſia vnto the tyrant Macrinus.
               When Meſia receiued the letter from the tyrant Macrinus, her nephue Heliogabalus, &amp; al the principall captaines of the armies beeing preſent (who of ſet purpoſe did beholde her countenance all the time that ſhée read the ſame, which matter was both merueilous and to be noted, in conſideration of ſuch a letter, ſo furniſhed with malice, and fraught with deſpite) ſhe neither chaunged countenance, or ſaide one worde after the reading of the ſame. Aboue all men or women of her dayes, in two pointes this famous matrone Meſia excelled, which is to wéete, for great ſolicitude in affaires, and ſouereigne patience in trauells: and ſo it came to paſſe, ſhe ofte vſed to ſay, that ſhée neuer loſte matter by negligence, or euer aunſweared anie man as one paſſioned. Heliogabalus and all that were preſent, did not a litle requeſt the renouned matrone Meſia to reade that letter vnto them, or tell what it conteined, which ſhe vtterly refuſed, ſaying vnto them, that it were a facte verie euill, preſently to reade it, and a déede much woorſſe, if after in time and place ſhée did not ſhewe it. This beeing done and Meſia withdrawne, ſhée aunſwered to Macrinus his letter after this manner.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Meſia Phoenicia, vnto Ancius Macrinus his perſon, health and conſolation in the Gods.
                           In this the fronte of my letter, I do not curſſe or banne thee as thou didſt me, in ye beginning of thine: for wee that be perſons bred and trayned in princes

courtes, do not a little preſume to be praiſed for our good nourture: and to eſcape to be noted malicious. Vrbanitie, beneuolence, and good manners, ought not to be loſte for anie vnkindneſſe, or forgotten for any occaſion: for that amongſt perſons noble &amp; ſhamfaſte, although they doe them iniuries, yet they endure not to ſpeake vile wordes. Thou ſhouldeſt haue remembred (Macrinus) that I was a woman, to whōe thou didſt write, and thou a man that didſt take the ſame in hande: and that, if thou hadſt founde thy ſelfe offended or diſhonoured by me, thou ſhouldeſt haue reuenged thy ſelfe with thy lance, as a noble perſon, and not with thy penne as a cowarde. The armour and defence of women is the toung, but men defend them ſelues with their ſwordes or weapons: wherfore my Lorde Seuerus did vſe to ſay, that it were a great wante in a man, to reuenge his cauſe with woordes: and too muche lightneſſe in a woman to defende her griefe with weapons. But the caſe ſhalbe thus, that ſince thou takeſt my office, which is to ſpeake, I will take thine which is to fight: for that the glorie wherof thou preſumeſt to haue ſlaine ſo manie men, thou ſhalte be depriued in receiuing thy death at the hands of a woman.
                           Thou ſayeſt in thy letter, that thou didſt baniſhe me thy houſe, and caſte me out of Rome, as a woman of an euill toung, and ſeditious in the common welth: Macrinus, thou haſte to vnderſtande, that I am not ſo much grieued with that which thou writeſt to me, as for the occaſion whiche thou giueſt mee to aunſwere thee: becauſe I may not directly aunſwere vnto thy vileneſſe, without diſgraceing of my grauitie.
                           
                              If I had beene a woman of an euil toung, and reuolting from the common wealth, (as thou Macrinus vniuſtly reporteſt) would they haue ſuffered mee in their courtes? and would the good Marcus Aurelius, Antoninus Pius, and my lorde Seuerus haue retained mee in their houſes? In Princes palaces, and in all citizens houſes, all vices are couered, or at the leaſt, ſhadowed, except the perſon that is ſeditious, or foule and liberall tounged: which is, not onely intollerable, but much leſſe to be hidden. I appeale vnto the immortall Gods for witneſſes, if in fiftie &amp; three yeres, in which I haue beene trained and reſident in Princes courtes, I did euer hurte any perſon, either in worde or deede, which thou knoweſt to be moſte true, becauſe all men did loue mee, for that I traueiled and did good for all perſons. Thou Macrinus didſt baniſhe mee thy courte, to haue more ſcope to followe thy vice: for thou wel knoweſt, &amp; alſo all perſons in Rome, that thy lewdneſſe and my grauitie might not dwell vnder one couert. Thou ſayeſt in thy letter, that my nephue Heliogabalus ſhalbe whipt as a boye, and I, as a woman ſhalbe ſent to ſpinne: vnto woordes ſo farre diſtempered, and of ſo greate deſpight as theſe are, I doe not permitt to be aunſwered, but to be reuenged. If, when thou didſt write vnto mee and my nephue, woordes ſo foule, and of ſo great enormitie, thou hadſt remē
                              bred what I was, and what thou arte: which is to weete, that my father was a knight of Phoenicia, &amp; thy father a ſmith of Capua: thou ſhouldeſt haue cō
                              ſidered, that in ſending mee to ſpinne on a diſtaffe, I would ſend thee to blowe at the bellowes.
                           To that which thou ſayeſt, that it were more for

my honeſtie amōgeſt frames to be weauing, then bribing and ſeducing the armies, which as thou ſayeſt ſo haue I performed: for I giue thee to vnderſtand, that I haue warpt ſuch a webb, as thou neither knoweſt to vnframe, or mayſt cut off when it is finiſhed. Macrinus, thou hadſt neede of more vnderſtanding, and alſo of more power, either to whip my nephue Heliogabalus, or ſet me to ſpinne: for, notwithſtanding our thoughtes be lowe, yet our fortune is high: but thou haſt a baſe fortune, and a hautie hart. Alſo thou ſayeſt in thy letter, that to make my nephue an Emperour, I haue diuided all my treaſure amongeſt the men of warre: and that of me onely it may be ſaid, that I robbed the Empire, to buye ye empire. To this I anſwere, that thou haſt ſaid right well: if, as thou art a tyraunt thou wert an Emperour: but I buy not the Empire for my nephue, but redeeme it from thee which art a tyrant, and no leſſe aſſured, that the fathers of the ſacred Senate wil allow my election, and violate thy tyrannie. In that thou ſayeſt that I robbed the Empire to buye the Empire, proceedeth of vile ſlaunder, and no leſſe falſhood: ſince thou, Macrinus, doſt know moſt certainly, that to obteine riches, I needed not rob the cōmon wealth: becauſe my patrimonie is very great, my huſbād left me rich, my ſiſter Iulia gaue me al her treaſure, my Lord Seuerus ceaſed not to giue me monie, the Conſul Furius mine vnckle, gaue me a yearely ſtipend, &amp; for al men for whom I ſued, ſomewhat was preſented me: in ſuch wiſe, that I had alwayes to giue, and at no time founde my ſelfe in neceſſitie to craue. If this be true (as it is moſt true) being a Lady of ſo great wealth: why ſhouldeſt thou Macrinus defame mee with theft? Beleeue me (thou Macrinus) if I

iuſtice, or haddeſt it by inheritance: but diddeſt rob it by tyrannie. Alſo thou ſayeſt in thy letter, that if I &amp; my nephue would yeeld obedience, thou wilt pardon my exile, and giue him a Conſulſhip. To this I aunſwere, that now al thinges are ſo farre concluded, that there remayneth no time to talke of ſhares: and if wee ſhould vnderſtand therein, thou ſhouldeſt take what were offered thee, without thy electiō of what ſhould pleaſe thee: for that partes and ſhares in ſuch like caſes, are not accuſtomed to be giuen by traytours, but by Lords abſolute in eſtate. Thou &amp; I Macrinus are incountred in ſo narrowe a condition, that the Gods, fortune, and alſo armes, haue to declare thy malice, &amp; my innocencie: thy tyrannie, and my iuſtice: thy treaſon, and my fidelitie: thy falſhod, and my trueth: thy crueltie, and my zeale: thy pride and my patience: thy treaſon, and my ſimple intent: which being done, they ſhal giue the Empire, not vnto him that deſireth, but vnto him that ſhall deſerue the ſame.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. VI. ¶Howe the tyraunt Macrinus was ſlaine in battell.
               AFter that Meſia had written her letter, and diſpatched Macrinus meſſengers, ſhe conferred with the principal Captaines of the armie: vnto whom ſhe diſcouered what Macrinus had written, and how ſhe had anſwered ye ſame: who were not a litle gréeued with the diſcourteſies that it conteyned, and greatly commended the aunſwere whiche Meſia had made. And as Macrinus had ſaid in his letter, that the Romaine hoſtes did vſe to giue the Empire, not vnto the perſon of moſt deſeruing, but vnto him that beſt did pay them: ſo yt 
                  Romaine captaines were not therewith

a litle deſpited, preſently ſwearing, not once but many times, that Macrinus might not ſatiſfie that iniurie with leſſe coſt, then with the loſſe of his head. Macrinus committed no ſmall error, in baniſhing Meſia, but much more in writing that letter, but moſt of all in charging the armies with ſuch an outrage: for that it was the totall occaſion, for Meſia to recouer more fauour, and Macrinus to loſe his credite.
Of this ſo notable example, princes and other great potentates haue to take example, that when their people or vaſſals ſhall be altered, or mutined, very much to conſider, not only what they do, but alſo what they ſay and write: for that in rebellious times, more hurt is done with a word or a letter, then at another time with a notable iniurie. The Matrone Meſia, with her exile not a litle gréeued, and with the letter no leſſe diſpleaſed: neither would ſléepe by night, or reſt by day: prouiding thinges neceſſarie for the warres, and diſpatching poſts for Italie: for her intent was, to ſuſteine her eſtate in Aſia with armes, and in Rome with letters and promiſes.
This citie which Meſia poſſeſſed, was of 2000. houſholdes, where ſhe made preparation of engins wherewith to whirle, and bulworkes to defend: and further, gaue commaundement, that the moſte valiante perſons, and moſt cheyſt capitaines ſhould remaine within the ſame: not onely to reſiſt, but alſo to offend. When Macrinus read the letter that Meſia had written, and was aduertiſed by his meſſengers, how patiently, and without alteration ſhee read his letter, he was not a little gréeued therewith: for he had opinion of ye matrone Meſia, that ſhee had ſkill to diſſemble iniuries, and after in proceſſe to reuenge the ſame.
               The Prefect of Macrinus armie, was a valiaunt Capitaine, named Iulianus, whom he ſent with his greateſt power vnto the citie which Meſia and her nephue Heliogabalus did poſſeſſe: giuing commaundement, that he ſhould trauel to take them aliue, to performe his promiſe whiche he had ſworne: which is to witt to ſet Meſia to ſpinne, and her nephue to bee whipt. Iulianus was a Capitaine bold

and valiaunt, who beſéeging the citie, which he thought to be in diſtreſſe, more then it was, and giuing a furious aſſault, hauing ſkarcely mounted on the topp of the wall, the ſouldiours of the citie by plaine ſtrength pulled him ouer, cut off his head, and hanged it out on a tower. The morrowe after that theſe thinges had paſſed, Meſia commaunded certaine of Macrinus Capitaines, to be called into her preſence, who vpon aſſurance approching vnto the foote of the wall, ſaid vnto them theſe woords: that which I haue to ſay vnto you (my friends) is, that ye behold and conſider vppon this turret, the head of your ſorrowfull Capitaine Iulianus: and ſay vnto your maiſter Macrinus, that the diſtaffe wherewith I ſpinne is that launce, &amp; that head is the call which I doe weaue and knit. When Macrinus heard the newes of the miſfortune that had happened vnto his Capitaine Iulianus, and what woordes the matrone Meſia had ſaid vnto the ſouldiers of his armie: hée ſaid (as it was reported) with a roring voyce: my deſtinies be finiſhed, my houre is come, and my fortune is ended. Macrinus with feare had his courage ſo daunted, that ſecretely he began to practiſe with the matrone Meſia, to diuide the Empire with her nephue Heliogabalus: but being (as ſhée was) in ſo great readineſſe, &amp; no leſſe paſſioned, ſhe would in no wiſe accept, either as much as giue eare thereunto: and that, if ye Empire were to be diuided, it ſhould be with an Emperour, and not with a Tyrant.
               
                  Macrinus perceiuing his offers to be reiected, his words deſpiſed, and his preſents nothing regarded, determined to make a proofe of fortune, which with the whirle of her variable whéele, many times doeth wound without threatening: and ſometimes threateneth without wounding. Macrinus gathering and alſo paying his armie which hée had in the confines of Antioche, departed vnto Phoenicia, where hee camped very néere vnto the citie, which Meſia and her nephue Heliogabalus defended: who preſently ſent to giue Macrinus to vnderſtand, that hee ſhould not neede to take the paine to aſſault the towne, for that within

very fewe dayes they would iſſue to giue him battell in the field. Two Romane armies, and two Romane Emperours, were in Phoenicia one againſt another: Macrinus partie euery day diminiſhing, and the other not only increaſing but alſo preuailing: for that daily the ſouldiers parted from Macrinus vnto Heliogabalus, vnderſtanding that hee was ſonne vnto Baſſianus, and did acknowledge him for their Emperour, &amp; kiſſed his hands as their natural Lord and ſouereigne.
               By the number that daily fledd from him, in their double ſpeach which they vſed with him, in the fickle ſeruice which they did him, by his bands which daily diminiſhed, and by their weake courage in fighting: Macrinus did clearely perceiue, that hee might not obtaine victorie, but ſawe himſelfe to be in daunger of a ſale vnto his enimies. Macrinus counterfected a ſhew vnto his ſouldiers of courage to fight, and yet was in great readineſſe to flye: for that at all times, when he iſſued to encounter or ſkirmiſh, he was mounted vpon an horſe of great ſwiftnes, and likewiſe diſguiſed.
               
                  Meſia being aduertiſed, that Macrinus had greater regard to the ſafetie of his life, then his honour or goods, prouided to iſſue at the ſoudeine to giue him battel: the which although on both ſides was throughly imbrued in bloud, and not a litle daungerouſly contended, yet in the end, Macrinus was put to flight, and ſtaied in a village, but with the loſſe of his head. This was the end and concluſion of the tyrant Macrinus, which vſurped the Romane dominion xiiij. monethes, and tenne dayes: who was ſo cruell (beſides all other vices) that amongeſt his owne ſouldiers he was termed, not Macrinus, but Macellinꝰ, which is to ſay, butcher: for that in reſpecte of the humaine bloud whiche hee ſhedde, hee more ſéemed a butcher, then a Romane Prince.
            
            
               
               CHAP. VII. ¶Of a notable letter written by the matrone Meſia, vnto the Senate of Rome, crauing the confirmation of the Empire vnto Heliogabalus her nephue.
               THe tyrant Macrinus being dead and beheaded, preſently the two armies ioyned in one: and notwithſtanding the one part had followed Heliogabalus, &amp; the other Macrinus, yet the matrone Meſia thought it not méet to moue diſputatiō, who had béene traytours, or who had béene loyall: affirming it to be more conuenient time, to win minds, then to reuenge iniuries. Although the matrone Meſia in al other matters paſt, had diſcouered her great wiſedome, yet in this caſe aboue the reſt ſhe made a ſhew of her great prudence: for that (to ſay the truth) in rebellious times, &amp; amongeſt mutinous people, princes ought not to occupie themſelues in chaſtiſements, but in reconcilementes. All the capitaines of Macrinus that eſcaped the battell, conceyuing howe Meſia commaunded by publicke proclamation, that no man ſhould preſume to call them traytours, either vſe them with foule woordes, ioyntly aſſembled of their owne francke minds, to confeſſe her to be their ſouereigne Lady: and to kiſſe the handes of Heliogabalus for their Emperour.
               The matrone Meſia vowed her ſelfe to ioy, for obteyning reuenge of the tyrant Macrinus, and to behold the armies ioyned in one, yéelding due obedience to her nephue Heliogabalus: that from the yeares of lxvj. ſhe diſcouered a geſture and countenaunce but of xl. yeares of age. Although the matrone Meſia held the Empire of her nephue Heliogabalus ſafe and eſtabliſhed, partly to ſée the enimie ſlaine, as alſo for the obediēce receiued of both the armies: yet ſhe prouided that Heliogabalus ſhould not intitle himſelfe

                  Vniuerſal Lord, or Onely Emperour, vntill the Romanes had receiued him, and the Senate confirmed him. Not ſixe dayes after theſe thinges had paſſed in Phoenicia, the matrone Meſia ſent a ſolemne embaſſage vnto Rome: and ſecretly gaue vnto the Embaſſadors many Iewels to diuide amongeſt the Senatours, and for time to come in her behalfe to make them great offers: to the end with iewels to trayne them to her purpoſe, and with hope to enterteine them. This being done, Meſia wrote vnto the Senate a letter ſufficiently well indited, after this maner.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Meſia Phoenicia, vnto the ſacred Romane Senate, health and grace.
                           Vnto men ſo glorious in acts, &amp; ſo graue in precepts and doctrine, (as ye are right reuerent fathers cōſcript) it may ſeme a matter both new &amp; ſtraunge, for a woman to write vnto the ſacred Romane Senate: which renowmed name the Gods to reuerence, &amp; men therat do tremble and are terrified. The matters, which by my embaſſadours I ſend to giue you to vnderſtand, neither for that I am a woman that may do litle, your grauitie hath not to cōſider of the ſame as a matter of ſmal importance: becauſe all men are not ſo wiſe, that none doth miſſe: either al womē ſo vnable but yt ſome eſcape error. Thoſe thīgs which ye ſhal read in this my letter, or ſhal heare at ye mouth of my Embaſſadours, I ſweare vnto you by the immortall gods, and by the ſepulchres of mine elders, that they be moſt true &amp; not feigned: for that in a Lady of mine eſtate, it were leſſe infamie to be vnchaſt, then to be a lyar. I haue heard my Lord Mar. Aurelius ſay, when I was but a child, that in women alwayes were conioyned, truth &amp; chaſtitie,

and a woman of trueth, was neuer but chaſte: &amp; a woman addicted to lying, did neuer continue in cō
                              tinencie. Some of you that now are liuing may remē
                              ber, when ye Empreſſe Iulia my ſiſter, came to be wife of the Emperour Seuerus, and how in her company I came to the Court, wherin I was long &amp; many yeares both ſerued and alſo perſecuted: for as in courts of princes, they that ſeeke their ſingular aduancement: ye one ceaſeth not to perſecute the other. Although in princes palaces where I liued, I haue beene perſecuted, defamed, and alſo enuied: yet I beſeech the immortal gods, yt the dealing &amp; entreatance, which then I vſed, with ſuch as wiſhed me euil, that the ſame &amp; no other, they will performe on me, which now wiſh me well. In 53. yeares yt I haue ſtayed in diuers princes courts, I neuer daſht any perſon out of countenance, I neuer toke the tale out of their mouth, I neuer ſpake any iniurious word, I neuer reproued any perſō, I neuer did preiudice any mans name, &amp; neuer iniuriouſly tooke any vengeance: becauſe in houſes of great princes, no man maye obteine aduauncement, if hee lacke ſkil to ſuffer. This which I here relate (fathers conſcript) is, not to recouer praiſe, but to the end ye ſhould beleeue me: for if my perſō poſſeſſe no credite, my embaſſage muſt needs haue iſſue of no effect. Speaking more in particular, I ſay: ye know that many yeares ſince my ſiſter and I departed Rome, attending on the emperour Baſſianus, and after that the traitour Macrinus had ſlaine him, Iulia his vnfortunate wife, ſo ſenſiblie did feele his death, that by extreeme ſorrowe ſhe finiſhed her life. Fortune would not cōſent to depriue me of my vital ſpirits, when my ſiſter Iulia was bereft of life: and this ſhe did, not to the end to forget mee, but

the more to greeue mee: becauſe in great perils and miſfortunes, if at yt time fortune did diſſemble, it was not ſo much as to honour them, as afterwardes to bee reuenged of them. Of the death of Baſſianus my lord and your emperour, as it was in my hands to bewaile him, if it had beene as well to defende him, either hee had neuer died, or elſe had beene raiſed to life: for that moſt truly, although Baſſianus were yonge, vaine, fickle, abſolute, &amp; diſſolute, yet on the other part, he was patient, ſilent, and pitiful: and it might haue beene, in the burthen of greater age, he would haue forgotten ye vices of his youth. There is no confidence at al times in moſt wiſe men, either deſpaire in fickle yonge mē: for that we ſee all day long, that many times age doth bring forth fruite, where reaſon did not yeld as much as leaues. He that in deede laide hands on Baſſianus, was that caytiue Martianus: but he that commaunded him to be ſlaine, was the traitour Macrinus: a man moſt truly of baſe condition, infamous life, obſcure linage, an idiot in letters, intemperant in ſpeach, vicious in maners, and a tyrant in his workes. Ye perfectly perceiue (fathers conſcript) that a man ſo much defamed, were a ſlaunder to be receiued &amp; accepted for a prince: for that in great eſtates &amp; Segniories, it is not ſufficient that their princes be valiant, but alſo honourable: which is to wit, not to want proportion in their perſons, and to haue noblenes in bloud, of all whiche things Macrinus hath no poſſeſſion: for, besids that he is of obſcure linage, infamous of life, cruel of cōdition and falſe of promiſe: ſo had he a ſwarte viſage, and a dwarfs body, he was ſplay footed, &amp; alſo proare blind.
                           Macrinus was not ſatiſfied to haue ſlaine Baſſianus, but alſo vſurped the Empire: and to heape euill

vppon euil, did ſweare vppon the altar of the temple, that he had not ſlaine Baſſianus, in ſuch wiſe, that the periured Macrinus, was not cōtented with homicide and manſlaughter: but before the Gods was alſo periured. But as the Gods are iuſt in rewarding the vertuous, and not careleſſe to chaſtice the wicked, &amp; that the election of men, being not confirmed of the gods: my nephue Heliogabalus and I, haue herein vſed ſo great ſkill, that at the time when the tyrant Macrinus was moſt abandoned vnto the vices of Antioche, wee cut off his head: in ſuch wiſe, that Aſia was ſet free frō his tyrannie, and the death of Baſſianus well reuēged. The armies that were ſcattered, diſcōtented, diuided, and euil payed, we haue gathered together, payed, and vnited: and poſſeſſe all Aſia in obedience vnto the Romane Empire. Alſo (fathers conſcript) I wiſh ye to vnderſtand, that in the time of life, and alſo after the death of the tyrant Macrinus, the armies did elect my nephue Heliogabalus Emperour: which election I will not denie but that I deſired, practiſed, procured, and alſo bought: for that it ſeemed vnto mee, that the Empire being in the hands of ſuch a tyrant as Macrinus, it was not bought, but redeemed. If in this marte of the Empire I haue offended, I wil yeeld my ſelfe to al maner of puniſhment: but therwith I would haue ye to vnderſtand, that I bought it with my money, openly of your armie, from a tyrant, farre from Rome, in a rebellious time, and for the ſonne of Baſſſianus: and I ſay for the ſonne of Baſſianus, which with moſt iuſte title ſhould haue inherited the Empire: if Macrinus had not vſurped the ſame.
                           Fathers conſcript, it ſeemeth not yt I haue deſerued blame, much leſſe any chaſtiſemēt: becauſe by my induſtrie

and proper goods, I haue paied your armies, ſet Aſia in peace, ſlaine the tyrant, redeemed the Empire, and aboue all the reſte, haue reuenged the death of Baſſianꝰ, &amp; giuen as his inheritance apperteined vnto his ſonne. As your armies do heare report, and there doe write, they were ſo poore and in ſuch diſtreſſe, yt more iuſtly it may be ſaid, not that I ſuborned but ſuccoured them with my monie: becauſe the more part had not to eate, nor garments to weare, aduēturing to rob vppon the wayes, and in townes to ſilch &amp; ſteale. And ſince my nephue is ſonne vnto Baſſianus, nephue vnto Seuerus, &amp; a young man of himſelfe in ſemblance of good inclination, it ſeemeth not that we haue erred in his electiō, either ſhal ye ſwarue in his cōfirmation: for that in life he reſembleth the father, and in courage and nobleneſſe of minde the graundfather. Neither is this election to be reproued, for his euil nourturing or doctrine: for as ye know, he was not trained in vices, but in temples: not with prophane men, but with honeſt prieſts: not robbing on high wayes, but offering ſacrifices: not ſheading bloud, but teares: not wandering at large, but withdrawen: not perſecuting men, but ſeruing the gods. From a child of much infancie, I offered my nephue Heliogabalus to the gods in the temple: where he hath beene inſtructed to be milde, chaſte, ſilent, patient, ſober pitiful, and abſtinent: and if by hap, he ſhall proue otherwiſe then nowe hee is, it may be for the libertie that he ſhal obteine, and not for the doctrine which he hath learned,
                           All princes paſt haue beene elected onely of men, but my nephue both of Gods and men: for that I vowed him to doe ſacrifices, &amp; the Gods haue rendered him to gouerne kingdomes.

Ye Romanes do greatly cōmend your ſelues, yt ye remoued Quintus Cincinatꝰ from earing at the plough to be Dictatour: but more is my nephue to be praiſed, that was praying in the temple: for of more excellencie is that man that prayeth before the gods, then he yt ploweth after oxen. In Rome alwayes in times paſt, the prieſthood was diuided from the Empire: but ye ſee that whiche was neuer ſeene of your forefathers, namely, that the prieſt is an Emperour, and the Emperour a prieſt: in ſuch wiſe, that with his ſacrifices, hee ſhal reconcile vs with the gods, &amp; with the empire defend vs againſt our enimies. Fathers cōſcript, great &amp; infinite thanckes haue we to render vnto all the gods, for that they haue giuen vs an Emperour which knoweth to pray, &amp; hath ſkil to fight: for as ye al knowe, few victories are obteined by fight of mē, if the gods do not diſpoſe the ſame. Although the election of my nephue hath beene done by the armie, and ſuppoſed alſo to be confirmed by the gods: yet neither will I yt he rule the empire, or be eſtabliſhed Emperour, vntill by the ſacred Senate it be conſidered, &amp; alſo cōfirmed: for I hold him not Emperour that is obeyed in Aſia, but that is loued &amp; elected at Rome. Since this young mā Heliogabalus is the ſonne of a prince, the nephue, the couſen, the brother of a prince, &amp; a prince elected, we haue al to preſume yt he ſhal proue a good prince: for that he is much bound to be good, that is deſcēded of many good perſons. As long as I enioy life, I ſhall not ceaſe to trauel that his life be ſuch, as the doctrine and nourture which I haue giuen him: and if after my death he ſhal proue euil, the fault ſhal then be none of mine, for as ye (fathers conſcript) do wel vnderſtand, no blame is to be imputed to him that is alreadie dead

neither may any excuſe ſerue the manifeſt fault of the liueing.

               THe Embaſſadors being arriued, &amp; their Embaſſage alſo knowen at Rome, both the Senate and people were in excéeding admiration, when they vnderſtood of ye great acts which Meſia had done in Aſia, &amp; heard of the letter that ſhe wrote vnto Rome: whereof many copies were made, and ſent to diuers townes &amp; cities. In Rome they found themſelues in great confuſiō, vpon determinatiō of an anſwere to ye demaund which the matrone Meſia had made, becauſe the Senate doubted her attēpts in time to come: in reſpect wherof they ſo deferd their aunſwere, yt the Embaſſadors cōplained vnto ye Tribune of the people. By letters of her Embaſſadors, the matrone Meſia was aduertiſed of ye diſſention betwixt the Senate and people, as concerning ye election &amp; confirmation of her nephue Heliogabalus: whervpon preſently ſhe determined to depart frō 
                  Aſia, to Italie, vowing wt an othe to conſtraine the Senat to performe by force, that which they refuſed to accompliſh of their owne accord. The Senate hauing intelligence, the matrone. Meſia to be departed frō 
                  Aſia to Rome, not to ſue or make requeſt, but to fight, forgate not to allow the election of Heliogabalus: commaunding by publique proclamation, that from thēceforth they ſhould hold &amp; eſtéeme him as their ſouereigne lord, &amp; obey him as emperour. The matrone Meſia iourneying from Aſia to Rome, &amp; vnderſtanding that the Senate had confirmed the election of Heliogabalus, ſtayed in the borders of Greece: for that to returne vnto Phoenicia was very far, &amp; to ſaile vnto Italie, no leſſe late. The winter being paſt, Meſia in the prime of the Spring ſayled into Italie, directing her courſe ſtreight vnto Rome, where ſhe was wel receiued, and no leſſe feaſted: although

it be moſt true, at that inſtant ſhee was more feared, then beloued: that ſhee was of ſo great ſkill, and of ſo much patience, that ſhe moſt wiſely could diſſemble iniuries, and accept and also gratifie ſeruice. Meſia was ſo prudent and aduiſed, that neither in countenaunce, geſture, wordes or workes, ſhe did either ſecretly or openly, diſcouer any malice againſt any perſon: but delt with all perſons as with her ſonnes, and honoured al men as her brethrene. All the Romanes were ſo pleaſed with the grauitie of her ſpeach, and the honeſtie of her life, that on a day the Senate &amp; people being conioyned, requeſted with great inſtance, that it might please her to accept the gouernement of the cōmon wealth, ſince ſhe had therein ſo great experience, and that her nephue was in Aſia. To this demaund Meſia aunſwered. Fathers conſcript, I do greatly gratifie your requeſt, which vnto me appertayneth not: for that it rather agreeth, with the condition of women, to breede and nouriſh Emperours, and vnto men to gouerne Empires.
               
               When theſe matters paſſed in Rome, Heliogabalus ſtayed in Phoenicia, attending an anſwere from his grandmother Meſia: who being aduertiſed that he was accepted in Rome for their abſolute Lord, &amp; ſouereigne Emperour, came immediatly vnto Antioch, with intent the yeare following to paſſe into Italie. Heliogabalus finding himſelfe eſcaped, &amp; fréely deliuered from the church, confirmed Emperour, diſpatched of the hands of tutours, abſent from his grandmother, and in poſſeſſion of libertie, to liue at his liking, his euil inclination preſently appeared: becauſe the vertue (if he had any) of his former life, was but feyned: for the euill inclination of young men, may for a time be diſſembled:
                  
                     but being at libertie, they cannot cloake it. The firſt inſolencie yt 
                     Heliogabalus committed in Aſia, was, yt he appareled himſelfe in a robe wouen wt gold, ſilke, cotton, flax, &amp; woll, large downe vnto ye foote, ſowen all ouer wyth pearles &amp; precious ſtones: and ſet a crowne on his head after the maner of Thyara; bracelets on his armes, &amp; earings on his eares: in ſuch maner, that vnto the ſimple hee gaue

occaſion to gaze, vaine perſons to talke, and wiſe men to woonder. All that winter he gaue him ſelfe to learning, not of ſcience, but to playe on drommes, fluites, and ſuche other pipes, to daunce as a ſhepeheard, &amp; ruſtically to ſing as a man of the countrie, and to ieſt as a Iuggler: in ſuch wiſe, that for him ſelfe he ſought out ſchooles agréeable vnto the life which he meant to leade. The ſpring of the yeare béeing come, Heliogabalus departed towardes Rome, where at the porte of Hoſtia, his graundmother Meſia receiued him: and when ſhée ſawe her nephue, in ſuch libertie of life, and ſo ſtraunge in apparell, ſhée was touched with no ſmall diſgrace, in reſpect of ſuche Romanes as did accompanie her: and no leſſe offended of the priuate and fauoured ſeruauntes that did attende him.
The matrone Meſia was ſo wiſe in her counſels, and ſo aduiſed in her actes, that ſhée conferred with her nephue in ſecrete, crauing moſted inſtantly, that in no wiſe hée ſhoulde aduenture to enter Rome with that manner of garment: for that it might fall out, in beholding him in the habite of ſo ſtraunge attyre, they would bothe mutine and be eſcandalized.
               
                  Heliogabalus gaue good eare vnto the counſell of his graundmother, but her requeſt he lefte vtterly vnperfourmed, which was vnto her no ſmall griefe and diſpleaſure: for that ſhée heard it with her owne eares, and the Romanes alſo ſaide it vnto her face, howe contrary the actes of her nephue were to the writing that ſhée had ſent touching him out of Aſia.
               
               
                  Heliogabalus béeing arriued at Rome, was receiued of the common people with greate ioye and ſolemnitie: but the auncient and noble perſonages of Rome, beholding his preſumption in commaunding, his raſhe and haſtie ſpeache, his greedineſſe in féedinge, his ſtraungeneſſe in attyre, and vnſteddineſſe and wantonneſſe in geſture, could not ſatiſfie them ſelues with ſighing, &amp; much leſſe with murmuring. When a certeine Senatour demaunded that matrone Meſia, why ſhée did permitt her

nepheu to be clad in a veſture, ſo vnaccuſtomed, ſighing ſhe aunſwered: It grieueth me not ſo much of his ſtraunge attire, as of his wicked manners: becauſe we may ſteale his garmente, but his lewde conditions wee cannot alter. 
                  To
celebrate certeine feaſts named Quirinales, Heliogabalus commaunded manie beaſtes to be ſlaine: and the moſte auncient and honourable Senatours to beare the ſpittes, being fixed vnto lances: in ſuch wiſe, that he thought to do them no ſmall honour, vnto whome he gaue a lance and a ſpitte. The matrone Meſia beholding her nephue Heliogabalus, euerie day increaſing from better to woorſe, the people of him to growe into hatred, and that he would neither beleeue her, either as muche as reuerence her, ſhe forgate not to leaue Rome, and to returne into Phoenicia, where ſhee had lefte her houſe, and alſo her riches.
               
            
            
               CHAP. IX. Of manie vices that were conteined in the Emperour Heliogabalus.
               TO reporte at large all the vices of Heliogabalus, were to emptie and drawe drie droppe by droppe the riuer Nilus, or to wade the great riuer of Danubie: becauſe they are ſo manie, ſo vile, and ſo ſcandalous, that it ſhoulde be ſhame to write them, and loſte time to read them. Of many we ſhall write a fewe, and of the moſt vile the leaſt diſhoneſt: to the ende, yt all men whiche ſhall ſée or read this writing, may conceiue the deſerued blame of the Romains, to holde and ſuffer ſuch a beaſte for their Emperour: for that he was not onely vnméete to gouerne a common wealth: but alſo his life in him was moſte euill imployed.
               We will write partly of his euil life, to diſcouer vnto men his euill end: for as ye diuine Plato ſaide, though men can

cloke and diſſemble others faultes: yet do not the Goddes pardon their iniuries. This vnfortunate Prince was vicious, abſolute, diſſolute, and (whereof we haue moſte to wonder) neuer weried in his wickednes: for, if vertue be tedious, vice is yrkeſome.
                  
                     Heliogabalus entring the Empire, preſently his houſe was furniſhed with lyars, Iugglers, &amp; ieſters: vnto whome he neither denyed the entrie of his chamber, or the ſecretes of his houſe. Heliogabalus greatly delighted to playe and repreſent the fable and ſtorie of Paris the Troyan, and the Goddeſſe Venus, who with his complices were clad in ſuch garmentes, as in the chiefeſt of their playe fell from them, and diſcouered their nakedneſſe: that vnto all graue perſons, occaſion was giuen of murmuring, and to all light perſons, of laughing.
               
               This déede was not onely of greate indignitie, but alſo eſcandalous to be repreſented of a Prince: for it ſufficeth not, that Princes be honeſt in their owne perſons: but they muſt not permitte either worde or deede that is vnhoneſt, to be ſaide or done in their preſence. They did yerely celebrate a certeine feaſt named Salabona, which continued thrée dayes, in the firſte day they were waſhed and let bloud, on the ſeconde they ſighed and were ſilent, and on the thirde they feaſted and reioyced in their moſte coſtly attyre, in the memorie of Adonides the greateſt louer that had béene in the worlde: the ende of this feaſt was, to repreſent the trauels, ſighes, ſorrowes, graces and diſgraces, that louers ſuſteined before their ſouereigne delight was obteined. Heliogabalus had in his chamber a young man named Zotipus, of bodye, face, and geſture, verie faire and gracious: but of maners and conditions no leſſe corrupted: for that in his woordes he was a lyar, in dealing double, falſe of promiſe, periured of his othe, and malicious in all his thoughtes.
               
                  Heliogabalus was oft aduertiſed of the words, déedes, and lewd life of Zotipus: but as affection did more reigne

in him, then reaſon, ſo could he neither be ſeperated from his conuerſation, or giue credit to anie reported that was ſaide of him, accompting gibes and ieſtes, gratious recreations: guile, liuelineſſe of ſpirite: deceites, diligence: croſſe dealinge, paſtime: and malice, ſubtiltie. Verie worthy was Zotipus of chaſticemente, and Heliogabalus of much greater reprehenſiō: becauſe if princes haue licence to diſſemble the faultes of their fauoured ſeruants, they ought not to allowe and confirme them: for of great reaſon none ought to be ſo acceptable vnto the prince, that opēly dare aduenture to committe euill. At the time of his repaſte, he did manie times commaunde Philoſophers and orators to appeare in his preſence, not to diſpute of naturall courſes, but of vnchaſte adulteries. At time of conference with
Ambaſſadours, Senators, or other graue perſons, he would either play with his handes, or twinkle and winke with his eyes, in ſuch wiſe, that ſuters departed with diſgrace, and not anſwered. As concerning women he neither ſpared matrones, married women, virgins, or widowes: but that all ſuch as he fauoured, he either obteined, or elſe defamed.
               
               
                  In drinking he was alſo diſordinate, for at ſome times he woulde drinke water, ſomtimes wine, ſomtimes ale, ſomtimes ſider, ſomtimes ſodde water, ſomtimes golden water, ſome times ſtild water, and at other times hee woulde not drinke, but brothes and colleſſes. In the manner of his feeding, he neither vſed authoritie, or obſerued grauitie: for at ſome times, he woulde eate ſittinge in a chaire, ſometimes on a bench, and ſometimes walking: for he vſed to ſay, that in ſuch manner, he did both eate and digeſt. Naturally hee was giuen to ſleepe verie litle, through the weakeneſſe of his braine: and ſlepte in all places without reſpect, as well in the temple, as in the Senate, in the garden, in the bath, in the bedde, and alſo in the market place: in ſuche wiſe, that hee wanted force to reſiſte the leaſte motions and affections of his inclination.
               
               
                  
                  Heliogabalus did inuent at Rome, a certeine manner of feaſting named, Feſtum vindemiarum, that is to ſaye, the feaſt of grape gathering: which feaſt was ſo diſſolute &amp; vnſhamefaſt vnto the viewe of ye common people, that afterwards in Rome they neuer cōſented to ye celebratiō therof. He was alſo greatly addicted to playe at tennis, and whē he was offended with any olde Senatour, either any auncient or honourable Romane, he would ſende for him to playe and accompany him: with whome he would playe ſo much, that in the end the ſorrowfull gentleman ſhould departe vnto his houſe, both tyred, beſwett, and drudged, and also many times deſpoyled of his money. He went verie ſeldome vnto the temples, was vtterly voide and barren of all friendſhip or affection vnto wiſe men, was neuer ſéene to read in bookes, greatly abhorred ſuters &amp; affaires, was negligent, either to paye or refourme the armies, made ſmall accompt either of friendes or enimies: finally he was addicted vnto his owne opinion, and a mortall enimie vnto reaſon.
            
            
               CHAP. X. ¶Of a letter written by the great matrone Meſia vnto her nephue the Emperour Heliogabalus.
               THE greate matrone Meſia being aduertiſed in Aſia, of her nephue Heliogabalus ſo farre inraged with vice in Rome, did write him a letter after his manner.
               
                  
                     My ſonne Heliogabalus, when thou departedſt from Aſia vnto Rome, I hoped to haue heard ſuch newes of thee, as might be ioyfull to thy common wealth, and haue giuen vnto mee greate renounce &amp; glorie: but as I am aduertiſed here, and alſo giuen to

vnderſtand from thence, there thou doeſt miniſter matter for all men to murmur: and here vnto mee ſufficient cauſe to weepe. Sixtie ſixe yeares are paſt ſince I was borne into this worlde, in which I haue buried and bewailed my father Torquatus, my mother Ariſtina, my ſiſter Phillis, and her huſbande Tharſus. Alſo I buried and bewailed my husband Ariſtippus, my ſonne Lucius Francus, my daughter Dolobella, and her husband Martianus. Alſo I bewailed and buried the good Emperour Marcus Aurelius, and the Empreſſe Fauſtina my good and gratious Ladie: in whoſe houſe I was borne, and in whoſe palace I was married. I alſo buried and bewailed the Emperour Commodus, the Emperour Pertinax, Annius Paſtor mine vnckle, Mirtha mine aunte, Camillus my nephue, and Ioanna my neece. Alſo I buried and bewailed the Emperour Seuerus, my onely good Lorde and famous Emperour. Alſo I bewailed and buried thine vnfortunate father, my deare and moſte deſired ſonne: whoſe name I dare not, either any other, expreſſe in my preſence: becauſe the ſounde thereof conſtraineth mee to breake foorth in teares. I thought it expedient (my ſonne) to leade thee vnto remembrance of al theſe thy predeceſſours, to the ende thou mayſt ſee, howe ſmall reaſon it were, that I ſhould bewaile the liuing, ſince I haue wept all the dayes of my life, for ſo many perſons that are dead. When thou waſt borne by ſtealth, and I did both hide and couer thee: when I did remoue thee from Rome, and brought thee vnto Grecia: when I cauſed thee to be inſtructed in Greeke letters, and bred and nouriſhed thee in companie of wiſe men: when I did offer thee vnto

the God Heliogabalus, and made thee a prieſt in his ſacred temple: I thought (my ſonne) that all theſe thinges ſhould ſerue mee for ioye and peace in my repoſed age: and not to bewaile thy childiſhe youthfulneſſe.
                     In this I acknowledge, how free the iudgements of the Gods are from the thoughtes of men: in that the gods determine one thing, and men ſuppoſe another: which hath chaunced both vnto thee and to mee (O my ſonne Heliogabalus:) becauſe the childiſhneſſe which thou doeſt vſe, and the vices thou poſſeſſeſt, I did not onely thinke, thou wouldſt not committe: but alſo, that in thy minde they ſhoulde neuer haue had paſſage. When I did place thee with the greate prieſte Gorgias, cauſed thee to be apparayled in the ſacred veſture, prayedſt daily vnto the gods, and alſo euery weeke diddeſt offer ſacrifice in the temple: I hoped thou ſhouldeſt haue proued a Paragon in vertue, and not (as thou arte) a monſter in all vice.
                     If thou wouldeſt conſider, many thinges do perſuade, and alſo binde thee to be good, but nothinge prouoketh thee to be euill: that is to weete▪ to be a man reaſonable, to haue beene a prieſt, to be borne in Rome, to be nowe an Emperour, to haue nouriſhed thee in my houſe, and to be deſcended of bloud ſo noble and generous: for it much prouoketh men to perfourme that which they ought to do, &amp; to remember from whence they be deſcended. Beleeue mee, my ſonne, that with leſſe coſt, and more eaſe, thou ſhalt be vertuous, then vicious: becauſe vices content the fleſhe when they are committed, and torment the hearte after they be perfourmed: but vertues

yelde not ſo much griefe in their woorking, as pleaſure when we haue giuen repulſe vnto vice. I may not comprehende the froward fortune that foloweth thee, or the ſorrowfull deſtinies which haue purſued mee: ſince I nouriſhed thee in trueth, and thou proueſt, and arte become a lyar: I bred thee chaſte, and thou arte imbrued with impudicitie: I brought thee vp in temperance, &amp; thou haſt ſtained thy ſelfe with exceſſe and gluttonie: I trayned thee in ſhamefaſtneſſe, and thou rendreſt a life moſte diſſolute: and that which is woorſt aboue the reſt, thou doeſt neither feare to offende the Gods, or eſcandalize men. Admitting thou wouldeſt not be good, for any offence vnto the Gods that haue created thee, or anye griefe or ſcandal vnto men with whome thou doeſt liue: yet oughteſt thou ſo to be, to remoue all heauineſse and diſpleaſure from mee thy olde and ſorrowfull grandmother: ſince thou knoweſt, I bought for thee the Empire, by the weight of money drawen out of my cheſtes, and by force of teares iſſuing &amp; breaking from mine entrailes. My ſonne, thou doeſt well knowe, that to make thee a Romane Prince, I gaue greate giftes vnto the temples, offered vnto the Gods infinite ſacrifices, gaue vnto the Pretorians all my treaſures, made vnto the Prieſtes great offers, &amp; ſent vnto the Senatours moſte riche iewels, all which is nothing: for if it had beene poſsible, I would haue giuen my bloud vnto the immortall Gods, that thou mighteſt be one of them. And if I haue erred in purchaſeing the Empire, much more ſhould I erre to make thee one of the Gods, ſince in thee no vertue is to be founde, either any vice wanting. The Gods haue made thee faire of face, gallant of proportion,

ſtout of ſtrength, learned in letters, expert in armes, valiant of heart, delicate in iudgement, and bolde in perils: but what profite all theſe graces, ſince thou art ſo greate an enimie of others counſel: and ſo farre enamored of thine owne proper iudgement? Thou followeſt vanitie, as one moſt inconſtant: thou doſt proſecute thine age, as one ouerchildiſhe: thou purſueſt ſenſualitie, as one moſt wilfull in follies: which thing for a while may be diſſembled, but long time may not be ſuffered: in ſuch wiſe, that either the Empire ſhal be loſt betwixt thine handes: or thou muſt dye within fewe dayes. As the ſeate of the Empire is conſecrated vnto the Gods, ſo they ſuffer not euil Princes long to reigne▪ which thou mayſt conſider in Tyberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Domitian, Commodus, Iulianus, Baſsianus &amp; Niger, al which had ſo euil an ende, that where the yron of the enimie entred, by the ſame place the ſoule departed. Oh my ſorrowful and vnfortunate ſonne Baſsianus: of whome vntil this time I goe laden with ſorrowes: and alſo thou haſt to holde it for moſt certeine, that ſince thou arte a diſciple of his euil manners, ſo ſhalt thou be alſo a follower of his moſt miſerable death. Being verie young, and as then but a childe, I hearde my Lorde Marcus Aurelius verie oft ſaye, that the immortall Gods did ſooner ſlaye euil Princes, then other wicked perſons: becauſe the euil man, is only euil vnto his owne houſe and perſon: but the euil prince liueth to the hurte of the whole cōmon wealth. I bought not the Empire, for any other cauſe, but chiefely to renue the memorie of the good Emperour Antoninus Pius: but alas alas of mee? whoe greately feare

and alſo hold it for certeine, that as in Nero the generation of the Caeſars finiſhed: euen ſo in thee the ſincere linage of the Antonines ſhalbe ended.
                     In the dayes that I remained at Rome, I vnderſtoode, and ſince I came into Aſia, I haue alſo ſeene, that by the proſperitie of a good man, many be aduaunced: and by miſhap of a wicked perſon, many finiſh and decaye.
                     I am aduertiſed, that in thy houſe and chamber, men of wicked life, and little wiſedome, haue free entraunce and familiaritie: which in princes houſes, is verie perillous, and no leſſe pernitious: for that ſuch perſons do procure thee to followe the counſels which they ſhall giue, and to diſſemble the exceſſe which they ſhall committe. If thou bee euill, and ſuch as attende thee be wicked: howe maiſt thou haue hardineſſe to chaſtice any euill? To refourme others, thou muſt firſte refourme thy ſelfe: and to chaſtice others, thou haſt firſte to puniſhe thy ſeruaunts: for that, if the priuate and fauoured ſeruants of Princes be diſſolute, the cōmon wealth doeth fall out to be abſolute. In the reigne of my lorde Marcus Aurelius, I ſawe his courte furniſhed with vertuous perſons, and in the dayes of his ſonne Commodus, I ſawe his houſe filled with wicked people: and am well able to ſaye vnto thee, my ſonne, that as their houſes were, ſo was their common wealths. If thou wilt liue in quiet, go alwayes in peace, and auoide ſuſpicion: keepe in thine houſe continually men of honeſtie, grauitie, and wiſedome, becauſe honourable and wiſe men in Princes houſes, yealde authoritie with their perſons, and profite with their counſels.
                     
                        Nowe, or neuer, thou maiſt withdrawe thine hande, ceaſe to be euil, and binde thy ſelfe to bee good: becauſe of all that is paſt, we will impute the fault to thy youth: which if thou refuſeſt to do, then will wee referre it whollie vnto thy wilfull vanitie. It profiteth not a litle for the healpe of good gouernement of the common wealth, that the Prince be of good life: for ſubiects hauing good Princes, imitate what they ſee, and perfourme what they commaunde.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. XI. ¶Of certeine lawes which the Emperour Heliogabalus made in Rome.
               
                  HEliogabalus made certeine lawes, wherof ſome were good, ſome indifferent, and others neither good nor euill, but moſte vaine: for as he vſed to ſaye, ſo greate authoritie haue Princes in their kingdomes, as the gods in the heauens. He made a lawe that no veſtall virgine ſhould make a vowe of chaſtitie, but to ſtande at her libertie to be incloſed, or to be married: for he helde opinion, that women were verie weake to perfourme vowes: and at euery houre, variable of opinion and aduiſe. He made a lawe, that no widowe might marrie within a yeare of her huſbandes death: on the one parte ſufficiently to bewaile the dead, and on the other parte, exactly to conſider of him that ſhoulde marrie her. He made a lawe, that no fleſhe, breade, wine, or any fruite ſhoulde be ſolde in Rome by viewe, but by weight and meaſure: becauſe in ſelling of thinges by weight and meaſure, they are bought according to their value, and not as they are praiſed.
               
                  He made a lawe that al taylers in receiuing garments to make, ſhoulde take the ſame by weight, to auoyd purloyning of any parte thereof. He made a lawe that no young man vnder the gouernement of father, mother, or tutour, might giue, take, or playe any money: becauſe it were to be preſuppoſed, that ſuch a one, being in no poſſeſſion of inheritance, had either ſtolne, or made ſome euil marte. He made a lawe that all maides, hauing attained the age of xxv. yeares, might marrie, althoughe their parents would not thereunto conſent: for he vſed to ſaye, that good parents haue more care to marrie one daughter, then to breede x. ſonnes. He made a lawe, that on holy dayes, and dayes of publique feaſtes and ioye, they ſhould not openly burie their dead: ſaying, it were an euil ſigne vnto the common wealth, if at the time of ioy, others ſhould begin to weepe. He made a lawe, that no Romane ſhould preſume to throwe out at doore, any ſeruaunt, ſlaue, or horſe, or any other beaſt, were it but a dogg, either for any olde age or ſickneſſe: ſaying, that for the ſame purpoſe, men ſerue from their youth, to be ſuccoured when they come to age. He made a lawe, that puniſhment ſhould not be giuen vnto théeues as Iudges cō
                  maunded, but at the wil of the perſons which were robbed: affirming theaft to be ſo foule a fault, that by the hands of all perſons they deſerued chaſticement. He made a lawe, that no citizen of Rome ſhould preſume to drawe, to drowne, to ſtrangle, or hang his ſlaue for any offence: ſaying, that to the Gods alone, and to Princes, power is giuen to ſlaye and kill, and to others onely to puniſhe. He made a lawe, that if any married woman ſhould committ adulterie with any kinſman or friend of her huſband, he might neither chaſtice, reproue or blame her, if ſhée proued that her huſband had firſt brought him to ye houſe: affirming: that a woman naturally of her ſelfe is weake, and beeing moued by any occaſion, hath no power to make reſiſtance. He made a lawe, that fréely all manner of perſons within the walles of Rome, might departe

from their wiues, and their wiues from their huſbands, after ſixe yeares marriage: affirming, that ſince from yere to yere was a long time to chaunge a garment, it were not much, that from ſixe to ſixe yeres, there ſhoulde be chaunge of marriage. He made a lawe, that in all Rome they ſhould haue no ſhoppe wherin to ſell compoūd medicines, but only ſimples and holeſome hearbes, to auoide reſemblance of tauernes, wherein they ſolde newe wines, but in ſhops only old medicines. He made a lawe, that none ſhould marrie in Rome but with his equal: that is to ſaye, a merchant with a merchant, a goldſmith wt a goldſmith, a ſeruaunt with a ſeruaunt, &amp; a ruſticall with a ruſticall: for he helde opinion, that men, in making vnequall marriages, do inforce them ſelues to more then they may, and ſpend much more then they ought. He made a lawe, that when any houſe burned in Rome, all the neighbourhood ſhould runne to the healp and ſuccour thereof, vppon the paine of any mans default therein, to contribute to the repairing thereof. Many other lawes were made by Heliogabalus, as Hiſtoriographers of him do reporte, of greate indignitie to be written, and no leſſe vnſhamefaſte to be reade.
            
            
               CHAP. XII. ¶Howe Heliogabalus was thrice married, and of his marrying of the Gods together.
               AFter that Heliogabalus was come from Aſia, he ſtayed in Rome an whole yeare without marriage: after which time he married with a gentlewoman of Rome, beautifull of face, and noble of bloud: and it well appeared, that he rather married her for beautie, then nobleneſſe: for that a yeare beeing ſcarcely paſſed, he was diuorced.
               
                  He did not onely remoue her from all honour, but alſo caſt her out of his houſe, ſpoyled her of all her Iewels and apparel, and conſtrained her by ſpinning and weauing openly to get her liuing. The firſt wife being repudiate, he grewe enamoured of one of the veſtal virgins, whome he remoued out of the churche, and openly eſpouſed: for which fact, the Senate was not a little grieued, &amp; Rome no leſſe eſcandalized: becauſe the veſtal virgines, were offered in the temples vnto the Gods, and ſworne and vowed to perpetual chaſtitie. After he vnderſtood the griefe of the Senate, and the murmuring of ye people, he mounted one day into the Senate, and wiſhed them not to be ſorrowfull for his marriage with a veſtall virgin, for that if it were an offence, it were but an humaine offence: and being (as he was) a Prieſt, it apperteined not vnto him to marrie, but with a woman that were a Prieſt: and if that were not ſufficient, yet it ſufficed that he was a Prince and an Emperour moſte ſupreme, vnto whoſe greatneſſe it appertained to make lawes, without all obligation to obſerue them. More then a yere, and leſſe then twaine, he was married vnto this veſtall virgin: to whome, as to the firſt, he gaue a libell of diuorce: and the ſorrowfull woman came to ſo greate and miſerable pouertie, that if the other did obteine liuing by ſpinning, this did purchaſe the ſame by adulterie: in ſuch wiſe, that of a conſecrated virgin, and of a noble Empreſſe, ſhée became a common adultereſſe. He married the third time with a widowe, and matrone of Rome, and for better occaſion he would oft ſaye, that ſhée was deſcended from the linage of Commodus: and that from thence foorth he would not take a wife, but of bloud very high, of beautie ſingular, and of condition moſte diſcréete. 
                     Heliogabalus
would oft ſaye, any Prince might eſcape errour in his firſt marriage: that is to ſaye, if ſhée were of baſe condition, to eſtéeme her of no reputation: if ſhée were foule, to abhorre her: and if ſhée were fooliſhe, to kill her.
               
               
                  Heliogabalus procéeded vnto ſo greate madneſſe, that

he did not onely deride humaine marriages, but alſo ſcoffed at diuine matrimonies: for that he determined openly to marrie his God Heliogabalus, and to celebrate matrimonie with ſome other Goddeſſe. The caſe was thus, that the thing which the Romanes held vnder greateſt guarde, reuerence, and veneration, was the Image of the Goddeſſe Pallas, which was ſaide to fall from heauen vppon the walles of Troye: this Image Heliogabalus commaunded to be taken out of the churche, where ſhée remained hidden, and to be tranſferred vnto his houſe: and from the day that ſhée was brought from Troye, was neuer ſéene with mannes eye vntil that daye. He made a coche of plate ouer gilded, aloft whereon he placed the Goddeſſe Pallas, apparelled in riche robes, and charged with moſte precious iewels: one of the Oxen wherewith the coche was drawen, was white without any ſpott of blacke: and the other was blacke without any ſpott of white. Heliogabalus went before with a goad in his hande, guyding the Oxen, and turning his face alwayes towardes the Chariot, in ſuch manner, that ſtill to beholde the Goddeſſe, he marched backwardes. The Romanes vnderſtanding, that Heliogabalus would that day playe the Carter, prouided from the imperiall palace vnto the temple, a broade and a ſandie waye, that in his backewarde walke he ſhould not finde whereat to ſtumble, much leſſe to fall. And when they were all come vnto the churche, they tooke the God Heliogabalus, and the Goddeſſe Pallas, married them, and ioyned them as man and wife, and made them a right ſumptuous bedd in the midſt of the temple, where they ioyntly ſlept all that night. The Romanes receiued no ſmall griefe, to behold Heliogabalus committ ſuch follies: for that preſuming (as they preſumed) to be ſo greate worſhippers of the Gods, it ſeemed vnto them that in making ſuch marriages, was to deride the Gods: and it might happen, that what he did but in ieſte, they might repaye in earneſt.
               
                  Nowe, when theſe Gods were eſpouſed, Heliogabalus woulde ſolemnize that marriage with ioyes: for which purpoſe, he commaunded the Circene playes to be prepared: wherin he commaunded infinite beaſtes to be ſlaine, and the fleſhe of them all, both good &amp; bad, to be eaten of all perſons: in ſuche wiſe, that there they did eate Lions, Beares, Woolues, Tygers, Vnicornes, Ounces, Horſes, Aſſes, Doggs, Beeues, Buffes, &amp; other wilde beaſtes, Bores excepted, which they vſed not to eate in Phoenicia, where he was bred and nouriſhed. Nowe, when all theſe feaſtes were finiſhed, and al playes perfourmed and concluded, Heliogabalus woulde make a ſhewe of the greatneſſe of his minde, and the wealth and riches of his perſon: and being aduaunced vpon the higheſt ſteps or degrees of the church, he threwe amongſt the circumſtants, a great ſumme of money, and no leſſe riches in iewels: for the ſcambling and getting wherof, manie were wounded, choked, ſtrangled, and ſlaine: and the hurte was not ſo ſmall, but that muche greater was the ſorrowe in Rome and all Italie, for the greate numbers whiche there died: then anie pleaſure of the money whiche they had gotten.
            
            
               CHAP. XIII. Howe Heliogabalus ſolde offices, and practiſed manie vanities.
               
                  HEliogabalus did marte and ſell all offices of iuſtice, &amp; of the Senate, as well Cenſors &amp; Edils, as Pretors and Tribunes, in ſuch wiſe, that he which gaue moſt money, although leſte vertuous, did beare greateſt office. It was a cuſtome in Rome, to electe no Senatour, excepte he were in linage an auncient Patritian: and of age, at the leaſte fiftie yeares: but he made his election (for the moſt parte) of baſe perſons, as gardeners, potters, and taylers: and

other young men of the age of xx. yeares. He did not onely ſell the offices of the common wealth, but alſo of the gouernement of his houſe: as porters, cookes, caters, chamberlains, and auditours: whereof followed, that at times when he would diſpatch them for their euill ſeruice, they would plead, that they had bought it of him for monie.
               
                  Heliogabalus being a friend vnto ieaſters, and greatly delighting in their conuerſation, it happened againſt the celebration of the feaſt of May, in the euen thereof, xx. carte loades of Roſes were brought vnto the Court, which being caſt all into one chamber, againſt the next dayes feaſt, hee commaunded thoſe iugglers and ieaſters to be throwen amongeſt thoſe Roſes, which béeing many, and they ouerwhelmed therein, were all ſtrangled with Roſes. He did neuer eate but at tables of ſiluer, or ſit in chaire that was not wrought with ſiluer, gold, and Vnicorne: and all the prouiſion of pots, ſkilets, ladels, ſpits, and all other things of the kitchin, were of ſiluer, and his cookes in ſilke. Secretely Heliogabalus commaunded an hundreth pitchars of flies to be taken, and being brought to the Court, he feaſted certaine Romanes: and being then Summer and time of great heate, and in chiefeſt of their dinner, he commaunded his hungrie flies to be ſet at large, who with their libertie gaue an onſet vppon the gueſtes, as vppon a campe of enimies, in ſuch wiſe, that the gueſtes gaue themſelues to flight, and the flies ſate downe to eate.
               On the day of the great feaſt of his God, all the ſacred Senate, and whole multitude of people, offering ſacrifices in the temple, and all the doores faſt ſhut, ſoudeinly he cauſed to be ſet looſe amongeſt ye troups of people, an hundreth cattes, tenne thouſand rattes, an hundreth greyhounds, &amp; a thouſand hares: where the fighte and ſlaughter was ſo great, and the confuſion, rumble, and crie of people ſo extréeme, that it ſéemed, hee went rather to ſcorne the Gods, then offer ſacrifices.
               The chamber where he ſlept, his Gallerie where he walked, the place where he did eate, &amp; alſo diſpatche affayres,

was alwayes ſwept, not with broomes of any cōmon matter, but of thréeds of gold: which office he gaue vnto one of the chiefeſt perſons of his Court. When he would at any time walke a litle on foote, it was not on hard ground, but
on ſand of gold. 
                     Heliogabalus was not ſatiſfied to weare ſhoes of any ſilke, or veluet, either of clothe of gold, or gold wrought with the hāmer: but the ſoles were of Vnicorne, and gold of Nilus: and the inſtep and vpper part therof ſet with pearle and moſt rich ſtones: in ſuch wiſe, that Heliogabalus ſhoes were of more value, then the crowne of Iulius Caeſar, or Auguſtus. He was much addicted to weare rings on his fingers, and ſometimes would weare them of braſſe, yron, lead, amber, and of leather: in ſuch wiſe, that this prince, the more to diſcouer his madneſſe, did weare ſhoes of gold, and ringes of lether.
On a time there came from Alexandria, 10. ſhippes laden with great and moſt precious riches: and vnderſtanding that they were arriued at the porte of Hoſtia, ſecreately he commaunded the mariners to ſincke them: whereof beeing reproued in the Senate, hee aunſwered: that thereby they had to vnderſtand his ſmall couetouſnes, for that he ſpent the riches of the earth, and drowned that which came by Sea. 
                     Heliogabalus
was prodigall and curious, not onely openly, but alſo in ſecreate: for that his Vrinall was of Vnicorne, and his ſtoole of fine gold. When he chaūced to iſſue out of Rome, he had wt him no leſſe then 600. wagons, which were al laden, not with cheſtes, apparel, either any thing neceſſarie or apperteyning vnto perſons of the Courte: but with women, ieaſters, muſicians, hunters, fiſhers, exquiſite wines, and victuals neuer heard off: for that he neuer went foorth of Rome to viſite countries, or conquere enimies, but to ſéeke delectable places, the more fréely to giue him ſelfe to vice.
A certaine Senatour demaunding why hee vſed ſuch exceſſe in ſpending, he made him anſwere: My friend, I giue thée to vnderſtād, that none doth inherite but after the death of ſome perſon: and therefore I will in my life time, make my ſelf mine owne heire.
               
                  The armies did not a little repent them to haue elected him Emperour, and the Senate no leſſe to haue accepted and allowed the ſame: for that he was ſo wilfull in all thinges, that he was not onely ſatiſfied to be vitious in all humaine vices: but watched and ſtudied to inuent newe wickednes. Meſia the grandmother of Heliogabalus, whiche procured, or (to ſay better) bought him the Empire, had ſufficiently aduiſed and alſo perſuaded him to be good and vertuous: but hee was ſo obſtinate in his euill, and ſo vowed and dedicated vnto vice, that he litle eſtéemed the counſell of his friends, either the threatenings of his enimies.
               When his graundmother Meſia perceiued, that good perſuaſions would neither profite, either great threatenings pearce him with any feare, ſhée remembred to fixe her eyes vppon her other nephue named Alexander, that the one being dead, the other might ſuccede: for ſhée helde it for moſt certeine, that in fewe dayes, reſpect being had of his many vices, his Empire ſhould finiſhe. As Meſia was auncient, prouident, and of experience: ſo ſhée perſuaded Heliogabalus with ſuch wordes, that he accepted his couſin Alexander as companion of the Empire, which election the Senate approued and allowed with great affection, and no leſſe gratefull vnto the whole people: and from thence foorth, although they obeyed Heliogabalus, yet they did yeald al their loue vnto his couſin Alexander. Heliogabalus being aduertiſed by certeine Nekromantike Prieſtes of Aegypt, that he ſhould haue a death according vnto his life (whereby, he doubted that his life ſhould be ſhort, and his death ſhamefull:) began to deuiſe with him ſelfe, what kinde of death might be giuen him by his enimies: and conſidered, that either they would cutt his throte, or hang him, or caſt him down frō ſome rocke, or drowne him, or end his dayes wt ſome poyſon: &amp; thus it was, he filled a ponde full of roſe water, wherein to be drowned: at the foote of a Tower of his houſe, he placed golden ſande, to fall on: he made twiſted

ſilke halters wherewith to be hanged: hée commaunded daggers and ſwordes of gold, wherewith to be ſlaine: and conſerued poyſon in Vnicorne boxes, wherewith to be poyſoned: all which he prouided of purpoſe, that at the time of néede he might one way or other end his wretched life: for (as he vſed to ſay) he greatly did not eſtéeme to die, if with ſuch, and ſo ſtately inſtruments he might be put to death. But the ſucceſſe happened quite contrarie to the forcaſtes of Heliogabalus, as well in dying when he would not, as in the maner of his death, whereof he did not thincke: for it is a thing notorious vnto all men, that we may neither inlarge our life as we deſire, either ſhunne that death whiche we abhorre.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XIIII. ¶Of the ſhamefull death of the Emperour Heliogabalus.
               AFter that Heliogabalus had accepted his couſen Alexander companion of the Empire, he not a litle repēted him thereof: for that hee clearely perceiued himſelfe to bée abhorred, and his couſen greatly beloued: he determinately purpoſed to depriue Alexander of his honour, as alſo to deuiſe a drift to diſpatch him of his life. Manea, the mother of Alexander, vnderſtanding the extreeme hatred of Heliogabalus ſo furiouſly bent againſt her ſonne Alexā
                     der, had ouer him great regard, that he ſhould not walke alone by night, accompany ſuſpicious perſons, féede of any meate that were preſented, or paſſe by dangerous places: becauſe ſhe was aſſured, yt to kil him, Heliogabalus ſought not occaſion, but opportunitie.
               After that Heliogabalus found the great gard &amp; watch of the mother and grandmother ouer Alexander, he went on a day vnto the Senate, perſuading with ſwéete woords, and after commaunding vppon great paines, to take that name Caeſar from Alexander, which they had giuen him:

this demaunde being heard of the whole Senate, euery man caſte downe his head, and aunſwered not ſo much as one word. When he ſawe the Senate refuſe his requeſt, he did write a letter vnto the Prefects, and moſt principal of the armies, to giue them to vnderſtand that from thēcefoorth they ſhould giue no honour vnto Alexander, much leſſe yéeld him ſeruice as vnto Caeſar: but the armies finding it rather to procéede of his ouermuch malice, then of any fault in Alexander, did not obey his cōmaundements, neither aunſwered his letters.
               When hee might not perſuade the Senatours, or conſtraine the armies, he aduiſed to bribe and corrupt his ſeruaunts and houſehold officers, promiſing them many and great rewards, if they would temper his meate with ſome poyſon, to rid him of his life. He conferred alſo with the tutours of Alexander, to finde if he might frame them to lead him foorth in to ſome Orchard or gardeine, or to ſéeke ſome deuice to leaue him alone: vnto whome he did not only promiſe great riches &amp; wealth, but alſo promotions to great offices. Heliogabalus perceiuing that hee mighte neither corrupt the one, or perſuade the other, for that hee was loued of al men, commaunded his counterfects openly to be ouerthrowen and defiled with dyrte: whiche was holden amongeſt the Romanes, as great an iniurie, as exactly to take away a mans life.
               On that day in which Heliogabalus had commaunded the counterfects of Alexander to be defaced and defiled, he prepared alſo in ſecreate, certaine his friends to kill Alexander, if vpon the chaunce of any mutinie that might happen, hee ſhould come forth: for he did beare him ſo mortall hatred, that it ſéemed his life to proſper to none effecte, if he might not ſpoile him of his life. The day before this matter grewe to effect, Heliogabalus iſſued out of Rome, to ſolace at a gardeine: and when they began to ouerthrowe and traile the pictures of Alexander, the Pretors of the armies aſſembled with great ſpéede, to ſtay the ſame: by which meane there was raiſed no ſmall ſcandal, in ſo

much that they did not onely repell that iniurie, but alſo purſued Heliogabalus vnto his garden to haue ſlaine him. All Rome being armed, the mother and grandmother of Heliogabalus, departed with great haſt vnto the garden, where he was perſuading him to take Alexāder in a Licter, and ioyntly to paſſe through the ſtreats: that after this maner, ſeing them both friends, the armies might be pacified and diſſeuered. Heliogabalus being vtterly voide of care of the ſcandal that paſſed in Rome, attended rather euery houre with great ioy, ye newes of Alexanders death, and the ſpoile of his pictures. As much as Heliogabalus determined to haue ſlaine Alexander, ſo much were the armies purpoſed to haue killed Heliogabalus: and for the execution thereof, with great furie they marched to ſéeke him at his garden: vnto whom there came forth to talke, not himſelfe, but his grandmother, of whom ſhe obteyned at that time the ſafetie of his life: which they graunted vppon condition, that hee ſhould correct his perſon, reforme his houſe, and viſite the common wealthes. On the nexte day, they caſte foorth and ridd the houſe of Heliogabalus, of Gabalus, Herodes, Gordius, and Murius, which were his fauoured ſeruauntes, and companions of his vices: and thoſe in déede, that from a foole, conuerted him into an idiot. A moneth after theſe things had paſſed, and the tumult pacified, in the Calends of Ianus, which is the beginning of Ianuarie, Heliogabalus refuſed to go vnto the Senate, either to ſend Alexander his ſubſtitute: whereof the Senatours found themſelues greatly iniuried, &amp; remayned thereof very ſuſpicious.
               And being as then very late at night, when the Senatours came from the Senate, they there preſently at the gates thereof, receiued commaundement from Heliogabalus, that without all delay vppon paine of their liues, they ſhould depart out of the citie of Rome, without viſitation either of houſe or friend: and as there were of them both ſicke and old, ſo it was lamentable to behold them wander in the darcke, ſtumbling in thoſe fieldes, and ſo

bitterly wéeping.
The Conſuls and Senatours being baniſhed, there remayned in Rome a certaine auncient Conſul named Sabinus, a man excellently learned, vnto whom Vlpianus did dedicate his bookes, and of whome the Romanes receiued counſell, in all their graue affaires. This Sabinus, by reaſon of his great age, came not out of his houſe: and Heliogabalus thincking hee had no other enimie remayning in all Rome, called a Centurion, and ſaid in his eare, that hee ſhould go vnto Sabinus houſe and cut off his head: and as it chaunced, the Centurion being deafe, and not vnderſtanding the commaundement to haue him ſlaine, but baniſhed as the othe Senatours, by defence of the Centurion, Sabinus eſcaped with his life.
               
               
                  The Pretorians, and men of warre being aduertiſed, that Heliogabalus had baniſhed the Conſuls and Senatours, and alſo commaunded the good old Sabinus to bée ſlaine, ſtrangled Siluius, tutour vnto Alexander, and remoued Vlpianus from his Cenſorſhip: with furious rage wente vnto the Courte, and breaking the gates they ſlue Heliogabalus, and his mother that bare him: and they killed, not onely all his ſeruauntes, but alſo his cattes and dogges, his Parratts, horſes, peacockes, and monkies: in ſuch wiſe, that in all his houſe they lefte nothinge aliue.
               
               
                  When Heliogabalus vnderſtoode the breaking vp of his gates, and the ſlaughter of his houſehold, thincking to ſaue his perſon, hid himſelfe in a priuie vp to the chinne, where they diſcharged him of his head: in ſuch wiſe, that conformable to his filthie life, hée receiued a naſtie death. Although Heliogabalus and his mother were ioyntly ſlaine, yet moſt truly ſhe diſcouered a more noble minde: for that ſhée died in her chamber as a Ladie, and hée moſt cowardly in a priuie. Heliogabalus and his mother being dead, they tooke their naked &amp; mangled bodies, and trailed them in the dirte alongeſt the ſtreates vnto Tiber, in the depth whereof they were caſt to be eaten of fiſhe, and not to bee ſought or found of men.
               
               Many Princes, his predeceſſours, &amp; ſucceſſours were very

euil, wicked of life, and pernicious vnto the cōmon wealth: but amongeſt all, Heliogabalus alone was hee, in whome was found no good worke: ſo he alone wanted a Sepulchre. By this Prince, all princes ought to take example, to flie wilfulneſſe, and the hatred of their people: becauſe a deteſted life remoueth all merite of honourable buriall.
               
               The Romanes not ſatiſfied to haue ſlaine, drawen, and drowned Heliogabalus, ouerthrew and whirled ſtones at his counterfects that were placed in the Capitol, &amp; ſcrapte out his name in all places where it was written: and the more to diſcouer their hatred, they did not onely kil all his ſeruauntes and friends, but burned all his apparell and iewels: in ſuch wiſe, that of him remayned no other memorie in Rome, but the report of his name, whereat they did ſpet on the ground.
               
                  Heliogabalus reigned 6. yeares, 3 monethes, and tenne dayes: he liued 32. yeares, 4. monethes, and fiue dayes: wherof 26. yeares he was a young man, very vertuous, &amp; a prieſt withdrawen and alſo ſolitarie: the other 6. yeares hee was an Emperour more abſolute and vicious, then euer reigned in the Romane Empire: for that the vices which were ſcattered in other perſons, were found ioyntly in his poſſeſſion.

               CHAP. I. ¶Of the nouriture and naturall countrie of the Emperour Alexander Seuerus.
               
                  
                     AVRELIVS Alexander was naturally an Aſſyrian borne, his father was named Varius, and his mother Manea: hée was couſen germane vnto the emperour Heliogabalus, for their mothers were ſiſters: and although he were borne in Aſſyria, yet he was bred and nouriſhed in Rome: for that in thoſe dayes his grandmother, the great matrone Meſia, gouerned Seuerus &amp; his houſehold, and alſo the whole common wealth.

                     Alexander was tall of body, of blacke curled haire, ſallow &amp; leane faced, with great eyes, a thicke ſhort necke, his hands drie, and of bigge ſinewes, ſlender legged, high of inſtep, and his complexion ſomewhat cholerike, but much flegmatike, which afterwards he diſcouered in the courſe of his life: becauſe he was mild of conuerſation, and in gouernement pitiful. Alexander was borne in the citie of Arſena, Septimus Seuerus being Emperour: hee was nouriſhed the firſt foure yeares in Aſſyria, &amp; then brought vnto Rome, vnder the gouernement of his grandmother, where after ſhe had kept him with her, other thrée yeares in Rome, ſhe returned him into Aſſyria: partly to auoyde the idle nouriture of the Court, and alſo for that Baſſianus ſhould not murther him.
The preſages of his Empire

were theſe: it was found moſt truly, that on the day that
Alexander Magnus died, this Alexander Aurelius was borne: &amp; at the time of child birth his mother came to viſite the Sepulchre of Alexander, where ſhe fell in trauell and brought forth this ſonne, who was named Alexander, his nourſe being called Olympia, and his tutour Philip: which were the two names of the father &amp; mother of Alexander Magnus. The ſelfe ſame day that Alexander was borne, there came an old woman to her houſe, and offered vnto ye mother a red egge, which a ſtock doue had layd at ye houre: aduouching that red egge to ſignifie no other matter, but yt the ſame child ſhould be Emperour.
                  Manea the mother of this prince, was a woman very wiſe, prudent, aduiſed, and no leſſe faire: and the ſpeciall cauſe why ſhee deſerued ſo greatly to be eſtéemed and honoured, was: becauſe no Romane woman did excéede her in honeſtie of perſon, either was equal vnto her in kéeping her houſe. As this matrone Manea naturally was vertuous, and inclined vnto good, ſo ſhe had great ſolicitude to nouriſhe &amp; inſtruct her ſonne Alexander in good maners, and to learne good and profitable ſciences: and to the end he ſhould not forget, in the companie of other yonge men, what he had learned of his maſters and tutors, ſhe ſet great watch, that none were permitted, either to talke, confer, or to be conuerſant with him, yt were not wiſe &amp; learned. After that Alexander was able to goe, his mother taught him to be temperate in diet, neat in his apparel, repoſed in his pace, and reformed in his ſpeach. He held ſo great meaſure in all thinges apperteyning to good maners, ſinceritie in vertues, and cleanneſſe from all vice, (which that age alwayes doth yeld) yt all men (vnto whom he was knowen) ſaid, that it was as much to ſée Alexāder in time of his youth, as Tullius when he was an old man. It was not to be found all the time hee was gouerned by his mother, that any one day hee did paſſe without learning or exerciſe, either in letters or cheualrie: wherof they both deſerued perpetuall praiſe, which is to witt, the mother in her cōmaundements, &amp; the ſonne for his obedience.

                  Many ſonns would proue good, if their fathers had knowledge to giue them inſtructions: neither would ſo many proue euil, if they did yeeld obedience vnto their parents: to whiche purpoſe the diuine Plato ſaid in his bookes of common wealth, that that familie was happie &amp; bleſſed, where the parents were prudent, &amp; the children obedient. Manea vſed moſt ſpecial vigilancie in the gard of her ſonne, not onely from all vſual vices, but alſo vicious perſons: for that many times, good inclinations are corrupted by vicious conuerſation. In his infancie, his ſcholemaſters were Valerius, Gordius, &amp; Viturius: this Viturius was he that afterwards was moſt eſtéemed in his houſe, and wrote the diſcourſe of his life, which hiſtorie was loſt when the Gothēs entered Rome. His maiſter for Grāmar, was Nebon the Grecian: in Philoſophie, Eſtelion the firſt: and in Rhetorike, Serapio the vertuous: &amp; afterwards when he came to Rome, he had for his maiſters, Eſcarius, Iulius, and Macrinus: graue perſons to inſtruct, &amp; learned to teach. Aboue all other Romane princes, Alexander was a friend of wiſe men, for whom he made diligent ſearch, &amp; enriched them if they were poore, honoured, enterteined, &amp; gaue them credit when they counſelled him: finally, a wiſe mā of him neuer receiued an ill anſwere, or foūd in his houſe any doore ſhut againſt him. Being demaunded, why he did ſo generally delight in the wiſe &amp; learned, he anſwered: I loue them for that which they know, &amp; honour them for that which they may: for in time to come, vnder their hiſtories which they ſhall write, our ſame ſhal ſhine and flouriſh. Alexander, in the dayes of his youth, was deadly hated of his couſen Heliogabalus: &amp; this procéeded, not of the ſharpe condition of Alexander, but for the euil nature of Heliogabalus, that is to ſay, for that he would not conſent to be a cōpanion in his wickednes, as by birth he was his kinſeman.
There were neuer ſéene, two princes ſo conioyned in parentage, ſo nere in ſucceſſion, &amp; ſo different in liues, as Heliogabalus, &amp; Alexander: for yt in Heliogabalus there was not one vertue to be praiſed, either in Alexander one vice to be reprehended.
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. II. ¶ Howe Alexander was aduaunced vnto the Empire, and of his laudable manners.
               TWo yeares before the Pretorians killed Heliogabalus the Emperour, Alexander was elected Auguſtus, to ye great grace, liking, and conformitie of al the Romane people: whereof procéeded, that on the day in which they had ſlaine the vnworthie Heliogabalus, they gaue vnto Alexander the enſignes of the empire. When Alexander began to reigne, he was very younge: wherfore, Meſia the 
                     •
                  randmother, and Manea the mother, did take the charge 
                     〈◊〉
                   gouernement of the empire: who although in condition they were womē, yet moſt truly in gouernement they diſcouered themſelues to be men. They elected xij. perſons to aſſiſt them in the affaires of the Empire, which were choſen amongeſt the auncient, the moſt experte: &amp; amongſt ye learned, the moſt wiſe: &amp; without determination &amp; iudgment of all theſe, they did neither heare what was demaunded, either determined any matter that they had to doe. The firſt déede of Alexander, &amp; his grandmother Meſia, his mother Manea, &amp; his xii. counſellours, was, to take order for reformation of temples: namely, to repaire the decaide, to clenſe the defiled, inrich ſuch as were robbed, and to populate ſuch as were diſinhabited: becauſe in the dayes of his predeceſſour Heliogabalus, not only humaine matters went to wracke, but the gods alſo were profaned. Diuine matters being reformed, preſently they toke order for cō
                  ſeruation of the cōmon wealth: &amp; before all things, all vicious perſons were reſolued from their offices: and not ſatiſfied to puniſh their offences, with depriuation of their offices, he forced them to make reſtitution of whatſoeuer they had either bribed, or purloyned, &amp; from thencefoorth to liue of their owne proper ſweate. Matters of iuſtice were not handled, but of men very well learned: Martiall affaires were not commended, but vnto men of great experience:

cauſes of the common wealth were not manured, but of perſons ſkilfull therein: in ſuch wiſe, that they prouided, not offices for men, but men for offices.
               Alſo Alexander reformed the whole condition &amp; eſtate of his houſe, as well the miniſters, as the expences thereof: which all the dayes of Heliogabalus excéeded in diſorder, &amp; was no leſſe defiled with vice: for which cauſe he ſet a ſeazment of the charges thereof, and elected faithful officers to ſpend the ſame: in ſuch wiſe, that in the houſe of Alexander, there was neither immoderate expences, either men wanting offices. Although order was taken for the ordinarie expences of his houſe, yet notwithſtanding, his houſhold had all things in abundance, conuenient vnto his imperial magnificence: and many ſtrangers that came from farre, praiſed Alexander, becauſe they might not accuſe him of prodigalitie, either note him of auarice. The temples, the common wealth, and his houſe being ordered, the good prince forgat not to reforme his owne perſon: not only for the maner of conſuming of time, but alſo for ye order and maner of his apparel: for that he vſed to ſay, if the monie which princes ſpend in robes ſuperfluous, &amp; the time which they cōſume in apparelling &amp; decking themſelues, were ſpent to the profite of their common wealthes, they ſhould obteine more fauour of the gods, &amp; leſſe hatred of men.
                  
                     Alexander was ſo humble in condition, yt publikely he cōmaunded, none ſhould call him, Lord, either by word or writing: but, the prieſts ſhould call him, brother: the Senatours, ſonne: men at armes, companion: and common perſons, friend: and this he did, for that he held the gods in ſo great reuerence, that he would they only ſhould be called Lords. On the ſuperſcriptiōs of letters brought him by Embaſſadours, or ſent him from any prouince, they wrote theron exquiſite and ſtately titles: wherin he prouided, no other ſuperſcription to be added, but this: Vnto our ſonne, our Brother, our Companion or Friend, Aurelius Alexā
                        der Romane Emperour. Heliogabalus his predeceſſour, did commonly weare precious ſtones on his feete, and moſt

coſtly iewels of gold and Vnicorne in his apparel: whiche thinges Alexander neuer vſed, either delighted to weare: for as he was wont to ſay, princes are not to be knowen of their vaſſals, by their rich robes, but by their good works performed in their common wealthes.
                  
He was apparelled moſt cōmonly, in white: in winter, with a certaine kind of blāket of Britaine, and in ſummer, with a certaine maner of cotton that was brought him from Aſia. Some times he would make him garments of cotton &amp; linnen wouen together: oftentimes ſaying, that he much delighted therein, for that it was very cheape to be bought, light to weare, &amp; might beſt be waſhed in ſummer. He would many
times walke in Rome with a friend or twaine, holding his hands behind: and finding himſelfe wearie, would enter into the firſt neighbours houſe, and ſit downe vppon a banke of earth, &amp; ſome times would there fall a ſléepe: in ſuch maner, that he had ſo great familiaritie with all men, as if he had béene one of them. He was mild, pitiful, patiēt, ſilent, in all things of great continencie, &amp; was neuer ſéene extréemely diſtēpered, or at any time to vſe furious words wt any perſon: for which cauſe, no maner of perſon did wiſh him euil for his euil déeds, but of a cancred and corrupt nature wherewith he was defiled.
               
            
            
               CHAP. III. ¶ How Alexander being inueſted with the Empire, preſently did viſite and reforme his common wealth.
               IN the ſecond yeare of ye Empire of Alexander, his grandmother the great and renowmed matrone Meſia died: in whoſe death he &amp; the Romane people alſo diſcouered great ſorrow, beſtowing vppon her coarſe, ſo honourable a funeral, and ſuch ſolemne obſequies, as apperteined to one that had béene couſen vnto the Emperour Seuerus, and had for nephues the Emperour Heliogabalus, and Alexander. Meſia being dead, the burden of gouernement was layed

vpon Manea, mother vnto Alexander: whome al men conceiued to be in full poſſeſſion of chaſtitie, temperance, prudence, and patience, but notwithſtanding ſomewhat inclined to auarice: whereof procéeded, theſe words earely in ye morning to be written vppon the gates: if Manea had not charge of monie in the cōmon wealth, ſuch a Romane had neuer béene borne in Rome. Long time paſſed in which the Senate had not béene viſited: which Alexander forgat not, as wel to viſite, as alſo to reforme: not only by inquiſition how they liued and gouerned the common wealth, but alſo how they ordered their houſes &amp; ruled their families: for he vſed oft to ſay, that the man which knewe not to gouerne his wife, to prouide for his houſe, and direct his familie, the prince might not cōmit a greater follie, then to place ſuch a one in the gouernment of the cōmon wealth. In Rome they were named Milites veterani, that long time had ſerued in warres, and were withdrawen vnto their houſes: theſe were mainteyned at the charges of the common wealth, and priuileged for apparance before a Iudge: and as Alexander was infourmed of their licentious and vicious liues, he commaunded them to be baniſhed Rome, and no more to be mainteyned by the common wealth. When he ſigned the ſentence of their exile, with his owne hands, he added theſe words: It is as iuſt that the vicious and wicked, frō a free man, be conuerted to a ſlaue: as the vertuous from a bond man, to be made free: for where there is corruption of manners, liberties haue no place: Moſt truely theſe wordes were ſpoken, as of a prince right worthie veneration. Alſo he viſited the officers of the common treaſurie, as if we ſhould ſay, the Auditors and others that had charge of the goods of the kingdome: amongeſt whome hée found many bribers, and néedeleſſe officers: thoſe hée commaunded to be puniſhed, and theſe to be diſfranchiſed. Alexander was greatly affectionate vnto the affayres of the common wealth: with which zeale he vſed ſo great diligence, that the goodes of the common wealthe were recouered &amp; gotten againe from the handes of robbers, and

ſpent and imployed in matters profitable: for it was his opinion, ye 
                  Good princes ought not to conſent, that vagabounds ſhould liue of the entrails of the people. He wrote vnto all prouinces, that in all ciuil cauſes, Iudges ſhould procéede according to the order and right therof, théeues &amp; matters of felonie excepted: who within thrée dayes after their apprehenſion, ſhould either be puniſhed, executed, made ſlaues for the ſeruice of men, or condemned to cōmon works for publique profite, and for no cauſe to let them eſcape: for as he oft ſaid, Neuer mā which had made a proofe in the knowledge of thefte, vntill his death, might at any time depart from ſo foule a vice. He alſo viſited the officers,
that had the charge of pay for the men of warre: againſt whome he receiued accuſations for payment of euil monie, imbezeling of payes, reckoning the dead with the liuing, and valuing their victuals more then they were woorthe: whome Alexander commaunded openly to be whipt, and for euermore to be baniſhed. He eſtabliſhed by publique edicte, that whoſoeuer ſhould aduenture from thencefoorth to ſteale, or imbezill any paiment due for matters of warre, ſhould, for the ſame, looſe his life.
All thinges which he had to commaunde, or prouide in the common wealth, hée did firſt communicate with ſuch perſons as hee thought to haue knowledge and experience thereof: and his manner was to ſay, that in following his owne proper iudgment, he had neuer but tedious ſucceſſe: but by repayring vnto other mens aduiſe, hee alwayes gathered ſome fruite.
               Hée held in his houſe many, and very notable perſons, of whome alwayes hée was accompanied: but amongeſt al whome he beſt loued, and did moſt commend his ſecréetes, was Vlpianus: this Vlpianus, beſides his great learning, was a man ſo vertuous, that Alexander would oft ſay, hée had rather aduenture the committing of ſome odious déede before the Gods, then ſpeake a foule woorde in preſence of Vlpianus.
               
               His predeceſſour Heliogabalus, had ordeyned many

lawes in the fauour of the fiſcall, to the greate preiudice of the people: for, admitting that goods were augmented: yet on the other parte, the common wealth daily diminiſhed: for which cauſe Alexander commaunded, that all thoſe lawes ſhould be reuiewed, conſidered, and refourmed: for, as he vſed to ſaye, it were more commodious for the Prince which is no tyrant, that his cōmon wealth be riche, and his houſe poore: then the common wealth to be poore, and his houſe riche. When he beganne to reigne, the people were abandoned to diſſolute manners: for which cauſe he made ſome rigorous lawes, and other milde and pittifull: but, when he commaunded them to be proclaimed openly, he gaue aduertiſement vnto his miniſters, to execute them in ſecrete. Conſider not ſo much what I commaund you, as the intent wherewith I commaund you, which is to weete, that rigorous lawes are not, but to terrifie: but lawes which are pitifull, to be executed, becauſe we make not lawes, to take away mennes liues, but to roote and weede vices out of our common wealthes.
               
               When the Senatours did ſitt in graue affaires, he was not contented that they ſhould ſaye their opinions by woorde, but by writing: neither was he yet ſatiſfyed that they ſhould ſet it down in writing, but adde alſo therunto ye reaſons which moued them to yt their opinion: ſaying, he did it to this ende, that none ſhould aduenture to yeld his opinion, either forced with affection, or corrupted with paſſion: but as reaſon and vertue ſhould direct him.
Naturally, he was an enimie vnto lyes and lyers: and if any man preſumed to lye in his preſence, he receiued thereof as great deſpight, as though he had done him an iniurie. He woulde oft ſaye, that good Princes haue to eſteeme ſuch for greater enimies, that deceiue them with flattering and lyes, then ſuch as do intrude vppon their countries: for the one taketh not but of his goods, but the other robbeth him of his fame. At all times, when they had talk of the election of any Senatour or Iudge, he was

alwayes hearde to ſpeake theſe woordes in the Senate: If, as nowe being preſent with men, I were in preſence of the Gods, I would craue their opinions in the electiō of Senatours and Iudges: for that the choice of gouernours in a common wealth, doth more ſeeme diuine, then humaine election.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. IIII. ¶Of the milde conditions of Alexander, and of his gratefull conuerſation.
               
                  ALexander was friendly vnto his ſeruaunts, whome he would viſite indifferently in their ſickneſſe: that is to wéete, as well the meaner, as the more fauoured: and in repayment of ſuch his viſitation, he woulde requeſt them to giue him aduertiſement what was ſaide of him in the common wealth: and if they ſaide vnto him any thinge more worthie amendement, then praiſe, he gaue them as greate thankes for that aduiſe, as at another time he vſed to giue for any greate and notable ſeruice. The Conſul Vncoiaſſon, on a certeine time in great ſecrete, ſaide vnto Alexander: I am not a little aſtonnied at thee, (moſte ſerene Prince) that doeſt permitt thy ſelfe to bee gouerned of thy graundmother Meſia, thy mother Manea, and thy wife Meania: who haue framed thy conditions ſo milde, that thereby thou doeſt impaire the eſtimation, both of thy perſon, and alſo of thine Empire: for that a baſe and ouerfamiliar condition, leadeth vnto cō
                     tempt.
               
               Vnto this Alexander aunſwered: I owe reuerence vnto my graundemother, becauſe ſhee nouriſhed mee: vnto my mother, for that ſhee bred mee: &amp; vnto my wife good companie, for as much as ſhe hath married with mee: and

ſince it is thus, with reaſon I ought of no man to be euill iudged, for that I do no more but duetie.
               
               From the daye that he was elected Emperour, vntill he was placed in his Sepulchre, there paſſed no day wherin he did not ſome notable déede woorthie to be marked, and no leſſe to be followed: which is to ſaye, hearing cauſes in Iuſtice, viſiting temples, being reſident in the Senate, repayring walles, pardoning offences, dooing good vnto the poore, and diſpatching ſuch other affaires. Hee was bountifull to Ambaſſadours and ſtraungers, and no leſſe refourmed in his ordinarie expences: aboue the reſt, he helde narrowe and ſtraight reckoning, and was well aduiſed with the officers of his common treaſurie, alwayes to haue in poſſeſſion treaſure in ſtore. Hée ſaide manie times, that the poore and needie Prince might neither be ſerued affectionately of his ſubiectes, or with armes reſiſt his enimies.
               
               
                  Vnto ſuch as were ſound, &amp; ſtrong to trauell, and yet wanted money to mainteine a trade, hee commaunded them to be ſuccoured with the goods of the common treaſurie: vppon condition, to repaye the ſame in proceſſe of time, with the fruites and profites of his trade: by which meane he diſcharged his Empire, not onely of many poore perſons, but alſo of théeues and vagabondes. All perſons that receiued either wages or ſtypende, he had regiſtred in a booke: wherein was written their age, linage, and ſeruice which they had done him, vſing when he was alone, to read in that booke: in ſuch wiſe, he did ſo ſpeake, name, and had notice of all perſons, as if they had béene but one man.
               
               The common ſtore houſe for wheate, and oyle, founded and furniſhed by Seuerus, Heliogabalus had bothe waſted and deſtroyed: in ſuch wiſe, that there remayned nothing in ſtore: this ſtorehouſe Alexander reedified, endued, and alſo prouided with excéeding greate aboundaunce of wheate and oyle: ſo that in his dayes, wheate and oyle did flowe and abound as water.
               
                  The Iewes that were in Italie, of all men were euill handeled, and the Chriſtians no leſſe perſecuted and baniſhed: nowe, when bothe the one and the other made complaint, Alexander commaunded them to liue within their lawes: vppon ſuch condition, as they perfourmed their ceremonies in ſecrete. He did much honour the Preſidents of prouinces, and when he traueiled vpon the way, they onely were placed with him in his Coche or licter: which he did, to the ende that all men might beholde howe much he honoured the miniſters of Iuſtice, as alſo to be infourmed of the ſtate of the common wealth of that countrie: for that naturally, he was ſo greate a friend, in that which touched the common wealth, that he did not onely take pleaſure to prouide and talke thereof, but alſo held it for a vice, to be forgetfull of the ſame. Hee vſed vnto no kinde of people ſo great liberalitie, as vnto Iudges, Tribunes, and Pretors, which had charge, and were ſincere in miniſtring Iuſtice: and aduouched vnto the Senate, that a Prince with reaſon ought not to bee intituled a Prince, vnleſſe he were carefull for the execution of Iuſtice: and if he finde any that is iuſt in the adminiſtration thereof, ſuch a one iuſtly may not be recompenced: for which cauſe, I giue them more then any other perſons which ſerue me, that by their enrichement, all occaſions to make other men poore, from them may be remoued. In the behalfe of the common wealth he was aduertiſed, that béefe and bacon was excéeding déere in Rome: in reſpect whereof he ſtraitely charged and commaunded, that no perſon ſhould aduenture to kill either calfe or ſuckinge pig, by the ſpace of two yeres: whereof it came to paſſe, within the ſpace aforeſaide, that a pounde of fleſh, which was ſolde for eight, was woorth but twaine. Of men yt ſéemed graue, prudent, and ſincere, he woulde alwayes be infourmed &amp; receiue aduiſe, for prouiſion of all graue and doubtfull caſes, and yet would neuer communicate or commende his truſt to any ſpeciall perſons: for he vſed to ſaye, that when the people do vnderſtand, that the prince

is counſelled or directed by any one perſon, ſuch a one, with giftes and requeſtes may eaſily be corrupted.
               
               
                  Alexander had a ſeruaunt named Belon, who promiſed a gentleman to diſpatch a certeine matter of great importance with Alexander, that touched him not a little, giuing to vnderſtande, that he was verie priuate with the Prince: and in remuneration of his promiſed trauell, hee receiued of that gentleman a greate ſumme of money: whereof Alexander being aduertiſed, and that which hee promiſed to obteine, to be a matter moſt vniuſt, &amp; no ſmal offence vnto the common wealth, he commaunded him to be crucified: affirming, that none ſhould dare to aduenture to ſell the fauour of the Prince, to the preiudice of the common people. He would many times aſſemble the chiefeſt of the people, and warne them to be vertuous, noble minded, and pitifull vnto the common ſorte: aduertiſing them, that aſſuredly he would deale with the vertuous, as with ſonnes, and with the wicked, as with enimies.
               Thrée times hee gaue vnto the Romane people, greate quantities of wheate, in time of greate dearth. Alſo, at other times he gaue, of his grace, vnto the auncient horſemen, great ſummes of money: vnderſtandinge the greateſt parte of them to be in debt. There were in Rome many perſones that liued not, but by vſurie, by which meane much goods were loſt, and many houſes become tributarie: wherein Alexander commaunded excéeding diligence to be vſed in the reuiewe of ſuch contracts, and a memoriall of the moſte notable griefes to be giuen him: which when he had conſidered, he puniſhed the vſurers, and gaue libertie vnto the poore men that were oppreſſed.
               The manner of his diſpatche in affaires, was, to be patient in hearing, mylde in anſwering, ſkilfull in conceiuing, and pittifull in denying: in ſuch wiſe, that if he gaue not that which they demaunded, at the leaſt he gaue them comfort with his woordes. After he came from the

Senate, and had diſpatched the affaires of ſuters, he did alwayes paſſe the time in reading Gréeke rather then Latine: amongeſt all other thinges which he vſed to reade, was Plato his comon wealth, Cicero his offices, Horace, and Quintus Curtius, with the life of Alexander: whom (his vices excepted) he diligently did imitate. If he ſawe any of his officers, that for age, or impotencie, might not ſerue: he did either call him or viſite him, giuing him many thankes for the ſeruice which he had done him: and would requeſt him to take it in good parte, to receiue his whole ſtipend, with eaſe and reſt in his owne houſe: and to place ſome other in that office, méete for his ſeruice. Vſually he did eate twiſe a daye, and in his féeding more cleanly and curious, then coſtly and ſumptuous: and neuer was offended with his officers, for the lacke of many, or exquiſite meates: but for want of cleanlineſſe, and good ſeaſoning.
               Many perſons wandring in Rome, and vagarant throughout all Italie, yole as caſtawayes, who diſdaining to learne ſome occupation after they were ſo charged by commaundement: hee gaue licence vnto all men, without further authoritie, to take them for their ſlaues: which if they renounced, then fréely to kill them. He did permitt none of his ſeruauntes to weare any ſilke, clothe of golde, or ſiluer: for that he oft vſed to ſaye, that open exceſſe of apparel, and ſecrete vice, were the deſtruction of Courtiers. Alſo he often aduouched, the condition of a good Prince was, more to be recreated with hearing wiſe men talke, then in taſting delicate meates. Alexander had
in his houſe a certeine perſon named Veturius Turinus, whome he loued: againſt him going and comming to his chamber, no dore was ſhutt: this fellowe was both guylefull and lying, and made all men, that were ſuters vnto Alexander, beléeue that he had more conference with him, then with any perſon of the Empire.
               
               
                  The caſe was thus, that Alexander being aduertiſed of his vanitie and lewdneſſe, and howe he deceiued, and

was bribed of many, cauſed a Foſter to requeſt Turinus to diſpatche a certeine ſuite with Alexander: who comming and going daily into the Princes chamber, alwayes aduertiſed the ſuter: thus, and ſo I haue ſaide in thy matter, and thus and ſo was I aunſwered of Alexander: the good Prince had true intelligence what Turinus vſed to ſaye, and of the bribes which he had receiued: whervpon preſently he prouided that Turinus was taken, and in his preſence by witneſſe conuinced of the guyle and deceite which he had committed, of his huge promiſes alſo, and howe muche he had robbed: which inquiſition exactly made, he commaunded him to be fixed aloft vppon a ſtake openly in Rome, and vnder him was ſet gréene woode and wette ſtrawe, which being ſet on fire, did yelde vnto his noſe a moſte cruell ſmoke, which was not ſo little, but that in ſhorte ſpace it deliuered the miſerable caytife of his life: a cryer with a loude voice makinge proclamation, Fumo punitur qui fumum vendidit: which is to ſaye: He that ſolde ſmoke, is ſmooldered in ſmoke. In all famous cities, he cauſed ſtorehouſes to be made, onely ſeruing for ſafe kéeping of the goodes and riches of ſuch neighbours as doubted robbing.
               
               He made in Rome newe principall ſtréetes, wherein he buylt ſtately and delightſome houſes, which he gaue in rewarde vnto his friendes and ſeruauntes that were wiſe and vertuous.
               Garmentes of pure ſilcke he was neuer knowen, either to buy or weare: and if by chaunce any were giuen or preſented vnto him, he beſtowed them vpon the prieſts of the Temples, to be apparelled when they ſhoulde offer ſacrifices. He was neither enuious, or couetous of other mennes goods: and in this caſe he vſed to ſaye, that the couetous Prince doth finiſhe and conclude in tyrannie.
               
               Naturally he had compaſſion of the poore, but moſte chiefely of the néedie ſhamefaſte man: that is to ſaye, that in former times had béen in honour, &amp; afterwards fell

into extreme pouertie: for he vſed to ſaye: there is no kind of miſhappe ſo vnfortunate, as for a man to call to remē
                     brance that in times paſt he had beene fortunate. All that he did take and confiſcate of malefactours, he commaunded to be giuen vnto ſhamefaſte poore men: with an inquiſition before hande, howe he fell into ſuch pouertie: whether by vicious aduerſitie, or by ſome other caſualtie: for he helde opinion, that to make him riche, which by vice was made poore, were a cruell deede.
               
            
            
               CHAP. V. ¶Of his zeale of iuſtice and other commendable actes, as well touching his perſon, as his common wealth.
               ALl the dayes of his Empire, he enterteined but one Phyſician, vnto whom, or any other, he did not at any time yelde his pulſe, either of any Phyſician tooke counſell: and to him would oft ſaye in ieſt, thinke not that I giue thée to eate, to cure mée: but to the ende thou ſhalt not cure mée. He neither delighted in Phyſicke, or that Phyſicians ſhould remaine in Rome: and for defence of his opinion he vſed to ſaye, that as greate infirmities doe not happen but by great exceſſe: ſo it argueth that the Prince which is compaſſed with Phyſicians, goeth charged with many vices. Preſidents of prouinces, when he ſent them to be reſident in their circuites, he did not onely inſtruct what they ought to doe, but alſo prouided them for all neceſſities: and at their returne, if they had done well, he relieued their neceſſities with his great liberalitie: but if they had done euil, he diſtreſſed them both of goods and fame. Pretors, Cenſors, and preſidentes that had charge of iuſtice, if they had no wiues, he compelled to take concubines into their houſes, to the ende they

ſhould not followe other mennes wiues: for he helde opinion, that it were not agréeable vnto Iuſtice, or according vnto the honour of Rome, that the Iudges for adulterie, ſhould be accuſed of adulterie. Vnto CHRIST he would haue made a temple in Rome, and placed him in the number of their Gods, which alſo was ſaid of the Emperour Adrian: but the prieſtes of the temples diſuaded him, ſaying: that they had receiued aunſwer of the oracle that if he ſhould perfourme that acte, all other temples ſhould periſhe, and all perſons would conuert themſelues and become Chriſtians. Alexander in Ieſtes, was gracious: in fables, inuentiue: in bankets, a companion: in gathering of golde, ſkilfull: in conſeruing, aduiſed: in ſearching of mines, diligent: in giuing, liberall: and in ſpeculation of newe deuices, exceeding carefull. In earneſt or in ieſt, in worde or in writing, he would not be called, but Romane: for which purpoſe, he made ſundry diligent ſearches of his genealogie, wherby he gaue demonſtration of his deſcent from the Fabioes Metelloes, which were noble and auncient Romanes.
                  Hee brought vnto Rome great learned men, to reade all Sciences: to which effect he erected many colledges and ſtudies, and indued them with greate rents, where the ſonnes onely of poore men were receiued and taught. Gouernours of Prouinces he puniſhed moſte grieuouſly, for their offence in Iuſtice: eſpecially, if they were noted, or rather accuſed, of bryberie: but if by malice they were wrongfully accuſed, the accuſer receiued the chaſticement of the accuſed. This good Prince was pittifull vnto all offendours, except théeues, and falſe witneſſes:
againſt whome he vſed extreme iuſtice: and reſpecting the offence to redound, not ſo much vnto him ſelfe, as vnto others, he affirmed: that ye Prince ought not to giue them pardon. Hee had alwayes in his chamber a booke wherein were written all notable ſeruices which had béene done vnto him: he alſo entred into the ſame, all greate rewardes that he had giuen: and if any man happened to do him ſome notable ſeruice, and

craued no recompence in conſideration thereof: he woulde
call him and ſaye theſe, or ſuch like wordes: What is the matter that thou demaundeſt nothing of mée? perchaunce thou wouldeſt haue mée thy debtour for thy ſeruice, ſince thou ſéekeſt not the recompence of thy trauell. Séemeth it well vnto thée, that thou ſhouldeſt obteine the fame of a faithfull ſeruaunt, and by thy meane I ſhould purchaſe the renoune of an ingrate prince? Howe ſhall others receiue courage to ſerue mee, when they ſée thee vnrecompenced for ſeruice paſt? knoweſt thou not, that if it bée iuſte, that ſeruants for treaſon comitted, be put to death: is it not alſo moſt iuſt, that Princes for their ingratitude be abhorred? preſuppoſing that thou wouldſt ſerue mée, without reſpect to profite thy ſelfe, of my magnificence: wherein I giue thée to vnderſtande, I finde my ſelfe more offended then ſerued: for at all times when they ſhall praiſe thée for that which thou haſt done for mée, they ſhall deſpiſe mée, not onely for ingratitude, but rather for hatred which I ſhall ſeeme to beare vnto thée. And if thou ceaſeſt to craue, in thinking mée to be in neceſſitie, and not able to accompliſh with all perſons, moſte vaine is thy iudgement: for that the Prince, hauing no other meane to paye, is ſo muche bound to recompence ſeruice, that he hath to redéeme it, euen from his ordinarie diet. Conformable vnto thine eſtate, demaunde what thou wilt: for ſince thou beeing a ſeruaunt, hadſt a minde to ſerue: it is iuſt, that I beeing a Prince, ſhoulde haue rewardes to giue thée.
               
               Theſe, and ſuch other woordes Alexander vſed to ſay, vnto ſuch as were mindfull to ſerue him: and forgettfull to craue of him. Thoſe that ſerued him, and others that craued of him, he did neuer recompence with the reward of any office of iuſtice: but ſuch as had ſerued him, he recompenced their ſeruice, with houſes, Iewels, inheritances, or money.
               For any importunitie which they ſhould vſe with him, any ſeruice which they ſhould do him, any Iewels which

they ſhould preſent him, or any fauour which they had of him, he gaue not at any time, vnto any perſon, any office for gouernement of iuſtice: if he had not ſéene abilitie in his perſon, and merite in his life. Euery ſeuentéene dayes, he payed his men of warre: and when they departed out of Italie, to conquere any countrey, he did eaſe them with beaſtes whereon to ride, and ſuccoured them with money to ſpende, for maintenaunce of their horſſes of ſeruice in courage, and their perſons from wearineſſe. When he trauelled vppon the way, he payde for the lodging of all his traine, &amp; did beare the charges of all ſicke perſons.
               
                  Certeine Chriſtians, and certeine tauerners came before him to plead for a parcell of ground, where the Chriſtians would haue erected an houſe of prayer, there to worſhip Chriſt their God: and on the other ſide, the tauerners alledged their great neceſſitie of that ſituation, for tauernes for the people: in which matter Alexander gaue this ſentence. Diuine thinges ought alwayes to haue preferment before humaine matters: wherefore, I ſaye and commaunde, that the Chriſtians make their houſe for Chriſte their God: for, admitting their God is vnto vs vnknowen, yet his honour is to be preferred before the profite of tauerners.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. VI. ¶Howe warre was offered in Aſia vnto Alexander, and what was ſaide vnto his Ambaſſadours.
               JN the eleuenth yere after the beginning of the Empire of Alexander, ſoudeinly he receiued letters from Aſia,
                  
wherein he was giuen to vnderſtande by his Romane officers, that there were reſident, how Artaxerxes king of the Perſians had ſubdued, and alſo ſlaine Arthabanus king of the Parthians: and not contented with that victorie, beganne alſo to occupie and poſſeſſe Aſſyria and Meſopotamia, prouinces ſubiect vnto Rome. Vppon which newes, Alexander ſeemed to receiue ſome trouble of minde, partely to haue warres in Aſia, which alwayes was vnto the Romanes both daungerous and coſtely: and partely, for that in tenne yeares paſt, he had ſéene no enimie againſt him in armour: as alſo, for that the ſucceſſe of warres conſiſteth not in leading greate armies, but in the fauourable prouiſion of the deſtinies.
               
                  Alexander, from his infancie, had béene bredde in peace, had gouerned the Empire in peace, and naturally alſo was inclined vnto peace: in reſpect whereof, it was no marueile thoughe he were annoyed with warres: for that the trouble and diſquietneſſe which warre bringeth with it, is more conuenient vnto cruell and vnquiet perſons, then for men of repoſed mindes.
               
               Hée commaunded his priuate ſeruauntes deputed for his counſel, to ioyne with the Senate, ioyntly to reade the letters that were written to him out of Aſia, and to determine howe they ſhould be aunſwered: for, as negligence is hurtfull in all graue affaires, ſo in the warres it ſlayeth. The letters being read, although they were therein of ſundry iudgements, yet in the ende they reſumed, that before they made Artaxerxes warre, they ſhuld requeſt with peace: for, admitting that at that preſent he deſtroyed the Romane territories, yet were it not agréeable vnto the greateneſſe and ſinceritie of Rome, to take warre in hande, before that ſuch warre were very well iuſtified. With greate breuitie Alexander diſpatched Ambaſſadours into Aſia, and by them did write vnto Artaxerxes king of the Perſians a letter, after this manner.
               
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Alexander Seuerus, Romane Emperour, to Axtaxerxes king of Perſians, health &amp; peace, in the pacified Gods.
                           Wee ſalute thee with health, becauſe we wiſhe it thee: and we ſalute thee with peace, for that wee bee louers thereof: and thou haſt not to holde it in ſmall eſtimation, that I ſalute thee in peace, and wiſh thee health: for vnto Princes that poſſeſſe not health, life is tedious: and they which haue not peace, it were leſſe euil to be dead. It may chaunce, that the warre which a man hath againſt his owne proper ſenſualitie ſufficeth not, but that he muſt inuent warre againſt ſome ſtraunge countrie. A man that may not ſubdue his heart, which within his own body is impriſoned, thinketh he to conquere the whole world that is placed in ſo great libertie? If in time of peace wee may not liue in quietneſſe: what ſhal wee do when wee awake new enimies againſt vs? The Prince that may not perſuade him ſelfe to conforme his wil and mind to the iudgement of one onely perſon, doth he think to conſtreine all perſons to be appliant to his onely iudgement? Great trauell hath the poore man, that wanteth all things: but much more hath the Prince yt is contented with nothing. Here we vnderſtand, that yu haſt aduentured thy perſon, ſpent thy treaſure, imployed thy friends, &amp; deſtroyed many people, to be lord of the Parthians: &amp; we fully beleeue, that nowe thou art no more ſatiſfied, then when thou wert only king of Perſia: for, contentation conſiſteth not in cō
                              quering ſtrange kingdoms, but in taming &amp; moderating our own proper deſires. Neither the Parthians

there in Aſia, neither the Romanes here in Europa, haue committed any deede, wherfore thou ſhouldeſt murther thē, or manace vs: but it may come to paſſe, that they ſhal reuenge their iniurie, and we deſtroye thy potencie: becauſe for the more parte, there neuer groweth any daunger towardes vs by our enimies which haue vs in hatred: but from our friends whom we haue offended. The Romanes and Parthians at al times haue beene thy good friendes, and thou haſt attempted an enterpriſe to offend them: but I ſweare vnto thee by the immortall Gods, that if thou doeſt not reſtore them that which thou haſt taken, and to vs, that which wee poſſeſſe: in ſuch manner, we Romanes wil make thee warre, that from commaunding as a king of Aſia, thou ſhalt come to ſerue as a vaſſal ſeruaunt in Rome. There wee ſende thee our Ambaſſadours, which ſhall declare vnto thee our will, heare them and beleeue them: and if thou wilt not giue faith vnto the woordes which they ſhall ſpeake, thou ſhalt hereafter giue credit vnto the armies which wee will ſende. No more, but that our Gods be with thee, and thine alwayes with mee.
                        
                     
                  
               
               The Romane Ambaſſadours which paſſed into Aſia with this letter, afterwardes reported, that when king Artaxerxes had peruſed the ſame twice or thrice, he ſpake in this manner.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Certeine woordes vttered by Artaxerxes vppon the receipt of Alexander his Ambaſſage.
                           
                              I haue read this letter of your Prince, more then once or twice: and as appeareth by the ſtyle thereof, he hath ſpent more time in the Achademies, ſtudying: then in the fieldes, fighting: becauſe warrelike Princes haue high thoughtes, and reaſons very ſhort: but in armes verie doughtie.
                           I accept your Ambaſſage, and explicate your credite, ſince the meaning of your Prince is, that I ſhall leaue what I haue taken from the Parthians, and not occupie my ſelfe in poſſeſsing that which apperteineth vnto the Romanes: vnto this aunſweringe, I ſaye: that the lawe which hath ordeined, this is thine, and this is mine, proceeded from baſe mindes and humble heartes, that wanted hardineſſe to enterpriſe greate thinges: immagining to defende by bookes, that which they durſt not winne with armes. The lawes made by poore Philoſophers ought not to preiudice the greateneſſe of Princes: becauſe the Goddes haue determined, that all thinges ſhall bee proper, except kingdomes, which amongeſt Princes ſhould be common: the right whereof conſiſteth not in ſuch as doe inherite them, but in them which may winne them.
                           The heroycall Princes, and high mindes, are not to bee ſatiſfied with the patrimonies of their predeceſſours: muche leſſe apperteineth it vnto their greateneſſe, to demaund by lawe, that which their enimies haue taken from them: but for preſeruation of their inheritaunce to ſpende their treaſure, and for conquering and ſubduing kingdomes, euery houre to aduenture their liues.
                           And ſince it is thus, that there is no king ſo vertuous,

but enuieth anothers kingdome: I am determimined to conſerue that which I haue taken from the Parthians, and to take what I may from the Romanes: and if fortune ſhalbee frowarde in this my iourney, at the leaſt all men ſhall prayſe the greatnes of my minde.
                        
                     
                  
               
               Theſe and ſuch other woordes Artaxerxes vſed with the Romane Ambaſſadours, which (as they afterwards reported in Rome) did not ſo much maruell at that which he ſaide, as of the minde wherewith he did manifeſt the ſame: for he ſéemed not to talke with the toung, but to fight with his handes. Nowe, when the Ambaſſadours were diſpatched and departed from the courte, he called them againe and ſaid: Saye vnto Alexander your prince, that I meane not to aunſwere vnto his philoſophicall letter: but in place of writing, I aſsigne him the fielde for paper, the lance for the penne, bloud for ynke, &amp; woundes for wordes. The Ambaſſadours being returned vnto Rome, and reporting all that had happened with Artaxerxes, the Senate were not a little touched therwith, and all the people conceiued no ſmall indignation, ioyntly ſwearing to breake the pride of Artaxerxes, &amp; to reuenge the wordes that he had ſpoken againſt Rome. This Prince Artaxerxes was much loued and liked of his people, and no leſſe feared of ſtraungers: and a thing moſte to be noted in him, was, that if in taking from others he had the ſhewe of a tyrant, after he poſſeſſed the ſame, he did gouerne as a right and iuſt Prince. Many Romanes requeſted Alexander, to aſſemble Sorcerers, and Magicians, to declare the ſucceſſe of that warre: whiche he woulde not in any wiſe accompliſhe, either might well indure the hearing thereof, affirming: that if as the Magicians &amp; Soothſayers, by their art, haue knowlege to vnderſtand things to come, ſo they had power to remedie the miſchief which they ſhould find, it were not vniuſt to

cōferre with them, &amp; alſo to ſerue them: but ſince I am certaine that I may not eſcape what my deſtinies wil caſt vpō mee, I will rather ſticke vnto that which the Gods ſhall determine, then vnto that which the Magicians ſhall report and imagine.
               
            
            
               CHAP. VII. ¶Of a diſcreete ſpeach vſed by Alexander vnto his men of warre.
               
                  ALexander vnderſtanding the proud anſwere that Artaxerxes had giuen vnto his Embaſſadours, determined againſt him to denounce warre: vnto whiche end hee ſent his mandats to all prouinces, cities, ſubiects, and confederats with the Romane Empire, to ſuccour them with monie, and aſſiſt them with their moſt warlike people. Eleuen yeres were paſt, in which the Empire enioyed moſt perfecte peace and tranquillitie: and vppon the tidings of theſe new warres into Aſia, they were not a litle amazed and eſcandalized: partly for exacting newe tributes, and partly for demaunding their huſbands and ſonnes for the warres. With gratefull minds and readie diſpoſition, the imperialiſts accepted the Emperour Alexander in his requeſtes and were no leſſe readie to yéeld their monie, their ſonnes, and perſons to be imployed in his ſeruice: becauſe they were fully perſuaded, that neither by his fault, that warre was raiſed: either by his want of merite, to finde therein any miſfortune. During the time that monie was collecting, and the men of warre aſſembling, he commaunded all the Capitaines, Centurions, and the moſt principal of all his garriſons and armies, to come before him: who being placed in the field, and hee himſelfe aduaunced aloft, hée ſpake to them after this maner.
               
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Alexander his Oration, to his Capiteines and armie, aſs;embled in the field.
                           Brethren, companions, and my friends, I beſeeche the immortall Gods, to giue vnto my tongue ſweete eloquence, touching that which I haue to ſay: and to place in your hartes congruent attention, concerning that which you haue to heare: becauſe, grace to perſuade in him that ſpeaketh, and permiſſion to be perſuaded in him that heareth, are gifts that many craue, but verie few obteine. The inclination wherwith we are ledd, is ſo proud, and the malice of man ſo wilie, yt there is none which eſteemeth himſelfe ſo ſimple, but thinketh to know that which another vnderſtandeth: and therefore, for one man to haue ſkill to perſuade many, is a gift that the gods onely do giue. With the ſeueritie of Demoſthenes, the prudence of Pythagoras, the wiſedome of Plato, and the eloquence of Cicero, many may hardly perſuade one perſon: &amp; doth one man thincke to perſuade many? That which I haue preſently to ſay vnto you, is not to the ende that ye ſhal do what I wil, but to vnderſtand what it is that you will: becauſe, in great and graue affaires, one hath to propound, but many to determine. But comming to the purpoſe: you haue knowen &amp; ſeene, that theſe xi. yeares we haue gouerned the Romane Empire: in which ſpace we haue trauelled to conſerue all men in iuſtice, &amp; ſhunned all occaſions that might hinder our peace: wherin we haue cauſe to giue thanks vnto the Gods, ſince we haue deſerued to enioy in oure time, yt which our predeceſſours neuer obteined. Although a

prince in his condition be a Saturnine, and in his life not well aduiſed, in conuerſation vnbridled, in keeping couetous, and proud in his owne eſtimation: yet all is to bee ſuffered and diſſimuled, if hee hold peace with ſtrangers, and without acception of perſons, doe equall iuſtice vnto his ſubiectes. It is knowen vnto you all, that Artaxerxes king of Perſians, hath deſtroyed the Parthians, and dealt foulely with all oure confederats &amp; friendes, and yet remayneth in ſo great power in Aſia, yt there is not againſt him one launce in the Reſte: but your heroycall deedes and noble mindes being conſidered, wee thincke not that ye either meruaile, or haue any doubt thereof: for that admiration proceedeth of ſmall wiſedome, and feare of cowardneſſe. Heroycall perſons, that amongeſt others would be notified, receiue with equall mindes aduerſitie and proſperitie: for vnto ſuch men, though the ioy of proſperitie, and the ſmarte of aduerſitie bee vncertaine, yet is their glorie vnuariable. Leauing the Gods, and ſpeaking of the affaires of men, nothing may iuſtly bee termed great, but that which bringeth with it great inconuenience: and then one is of more valure then all, when one doeth that whiche all leaue vndone: for, greatneſſe conſiſteth not in poſſeſſing proud deſires: but in perfourming deedes of nobleneſſe.
                           From Rome wee haue ſent oure Embaſſadours vnto Artaxerxes, to perſuade him to leaue thoſe prouinces whiche hee hath taken, and to abſtaine from them which hee ment to take: which hee not onely refuſeth to doe, but hardly might endure the hearing therof: for which cauſe, it apperteineth vnto the greatneſſe of Rome, to employ it ſelfe to the breaking

of his pride: for that it proceeded not of leſſe vertue to humble the proud, then to aduaunce the humble. Many of you which be here, haue beene bred, and alſo preſent at the glorious acts of Antoninus Pius, and Seuerus my progenitours, noble men of immortall renowne: and notwithſtanding that by the antiquitie of your yeares, and the trauels which ye haue paſſed in the warres, ye may not fight, yet at the leaſt ye ſhal profite vs by your aduiſe and counſell: whiche in the warres is verie neceſſarie, and no leſſe profitable: for that in ſuch aſſembly, one counſell is oft giuen, that exceedeth the ſeruice of a thouſand horſemen. Perfectly wee ought to hope, that wee Romanes ſhal bee conquerours, and the Barbarians ouerthrowen: not onely for that they firſt raiſed this warre, but alſo becauſe we haue requeſted them with peace: wherein ye Gods are ſo iuſt, that very ſildome they permit them to enioy the victorie, who were the occaſion to raiſe that warre. And doubt ye neuer the more, for that our armour is old &amp; ruſtie: becauſe the felicitie of warre, conſiſteth not in bright armour, but in doughtie harts and noble mindes. Many which march on land in bright armour, be ouercome: and all men that go by ſea, weare ruſtie armour, and doe conquere: in ſuch wiſe, that warre is not mainteyned with armour of yron, but with heartes of ſteele.

                              dard of a young prince, which wanteth experience in the warres: but as of the reſt, ſo of this ye ſhal haue no cauſe to doubt: for that I go determined, intending in the acte of fighting, to fight as one of you: &amp; in matters of counſell, to yeeld my ſelfe vnto the counſel of the auncient.
                           
                              For any want of victuals, neither haue ye to ſuſpecte: for that we are prouided alreadie in the chanel of Byzantio, with wheate of Sicyl, wines of Cādie, bacon of Campania, oyle of Spaine, ſalt of Capua, pouldred beefe of Cerdonia, and oates and beanes of Normandie. For other pleaſaunt and delectable things, I neither cōmaund to ſearch, either would I (if they were found) ſuffer them to be tranſported: becauſe in the warres, they may hardly ſubdue their enimies, that are ouercome with vices. Scipio the African, when he went to beſiege the renowmed Numantia, founde thirtie thouſand Romanes (which xiiii. yeares had beene at the ſiege thereof) enuironed with two hundreth thouſand vices: who (like a ſkilfull Capitaine) baniſhed both vice &amp; vicious perſōs out of his campe: this being accompliſhed, preſently the enimies were ouercome. In this iourny ſo tedious, perilous, chargeable &amp; coſtly, I would not that ye ſhould do more thē ye ſhall ſee me doe: becauſe in trauell vppon the way, ſayling on the ſea, defending paſſages, executing on ye enimies, and in the vſage of my perſon, ye ſhall finde mee an affable companion, and no niggardly prince.
                        
                     
                  
               
               Theſe, and ſuch other woordes Alexander vſed vnto his armie: which being heard, with lowde voyces they did all wiſh the Gods to preſerue his life, and ſaid with one aſſent, that they were readie to go and die in that warre in his ſeruice. This ſpeach being ended, he diuided amongeſt his armies much monie, according to the cuſtome of the Romane Emperours: which was not giuen in part of paiment of their wages, but to animate them, that with the better wil they might indure the trauels of warre.
            
            
               
               CHAP. VIII. ¶ Howe the Romanes were ouercome of the Perſians.
               
                  AFter that Alexander had diſcourſed wt his Captaines and prouided all thinges neceſſarie for his iourney, he commaunded open warre to be proclaimed againſt Aſia, &amp; a day appointed for his departing: before which time, hée made great ſacrifices in the temples, and vowes vnto the Gods: becauſe the good Romane princes vſed for cuſtome, firſt to pacifie the yre of the Gods, before they tooke armes againſt their enimies.
On the day in which he iſſued out of Rome, all the Senate and people did accompanie him 3. miles: &amp; further alſo (a thing much to be noted) there was none which beheld him departing, but bitterly fell a wéeping: for that being (as he was) a prince ſo pitiful, of all mē he was cordially and hartily beloued. From the time yt hée departed from Rome, he ſtayed not, vntil he arriued at the citie Alexandria: to which place he had commaunded all ye garriſons of Illyria to repaire, yt there being aſſembled, the ignorant might exerciſe feates of armes: &amp; further, to prouide things neceſſarie for ye warres. Alexander being arriued at Alexandria, it ſéemed vnto him, &amp; to his graue Romane counſellers, to ſend another Embaſſage to Artaxerxes, king of the Perſians, once more to inuite him to peace: which if he refuſed, then againſt him to ſound defiance.
               
                  Artaxerxes being aduertiſed of Alexander his paſſage into Aſia, &amp; the cōming of his Embaſſadours into his kingdom, did neither manifeſt any feare of the Romane power, either was any thing altered with this newe Embaſſage, making the Legates none other anſwere, but that ſhortly he would ſend a newe embaſſage. Within 6. dayes after, Artaxerxes ſent an embaſſage of 400. horſemen to Alexander, of the moſt noble, valiant, and gallanteſt gentlemen of his armies: and the end wherfore he ſent ſo many and ſo braue, was, to terrifie the Romanes with the magnificence of ye 
                  Perſians. The Embaſſage of thoſe 400. perſons, were compriſed in fewe words, and after this maner were they written.
               
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              The Embaſſage of Artaxerxes, the Perſian king, to Alexander the renowmed Emperour.
                           The great king Artaxerxes, Lord of the Perſians, cōmaundeth thee Alexander, king of the Romanes, to depart out of Aſia, and ceaſe to enter poſſeſſion of Aſſyria: care not to enter into Ionia, Caria, either to haue to doe with Pontus, the ſea Aegeum, either to paſſe any countrie or prouince which cōfineth or bordereth vpon Europa: for otherwiſe, in not accōpliſhing theſe thinges, it ſhal be neceſſarie yt thou be chaſtiſed.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     Alexander conſidering this proud Embaſſage, cōmaunded al the 400. Embaſſadours to be taken, &amp; rewarding others with all the apparell which they did weare, and the iewels which they had, he ſent them baniſhed into Phrygia, there to till the lands, &amp; plow wt oxen. Some gaue Alexander counſel, not to baniſh but to hang them: to whom he anſwered: he that ſaith in his Embaſſage no more then he is cōmaunded, &amp; fighteth for defence of his coūtrie, vniuſtly they take away his life. Alexander poſſeſſing an armie of great power, forgot not to diuide the ſame into thrée parts, yt is to ſay, ſending the one by the way of Armenia, ye other along the borders of Tygris &amp; Euphrates, &amp; the third part he ledd with himſelfe to enter into the countries and fields of his enimies: to the end, that the Perſians beholding themſelues aſſailed on euery ſide, ſhould yéeld and ſtoope to the ſeruice of the Romanes.
                  
In thoſe dayes, ye 
                  Perſians had not ſkil orderly to giue a battel, but ye ioyntly they fought in heapes, &amp; ſo either they did ſubdue, or were ſubdued: and that which is more to be meruailed, as well women went to the warres as men: neither did the prince giue wages vnto the one or the other, more then euery one was able to get, rob, and ſpoile in the ſame. Although the Perſians were not readie in kéeping of aray, yet on the other parte, they were much accuſtomed vnto armes, and from their youth addicted to runne horſes, and ſhoote arrowes.

that the Perſians had ſlaine their parentes, &amp; that their wiues and children were now deſtroyed by the Germaines. Excéeding was the ſorrow which ſtoung Alexanders heart, conſidering with what haſte he was called vnto the warres of Germanie: chiefly, for aduertiſement of the neceſſitie of his perſonal preſence in the ſame warrs: for otherwiſe, the Romanes would not repaire: and ſuch as came diſcomfited from Aſia, would all depart. The greateſt griefe that did cruciate and torment his heart, was, to thinke that at ye houre in which the fame of his vnfortunat fight ſhould be diuulgate and noyſed through the Empire, and the Germaines newly reuolted, his enimies in Rome would attempt ſome commotion in the common wealthe: for that it is naturall vnto the common people, to deſire daily chaunge of newe Lords. The Emperour Alexander determined in his owne perſon to be in the warrs of Germanie: and on the other part, did write to the Senate amorous letters, ſending vnto Rome, to be offered in the temples, great ſacrifices: and ſhippes loaden with wheate and oyle, to be diuided amongeſt the people: and ioyntly with this, he ſecreately prouided to furniſhe the frontiars with men and victuals: in ſuch wiſe, that this good prince, in his owne perſon would goe to the warres againſt his enimies: and with his goods would winne the heartes of his ſubiects. With no ſmall diligence, Alexander traueiled from Aſia to Germanie: and immediately vppon his arriuall at Rhene, he made bridges of boates, whereon his armies might fréely paſſe, and alſo fight with his enimies.
               
                  Alexander iourneying towards Germanie, enterteyned certaine people called Maures, which liued in the fieldes Oſſroanos, bordering vppon Thracia: who fought with long lances, hauing a head of yron at eche ende, with ſuch dexteritie and readineſſe on horſeback, that in riding they would take vp their lances falne vnto the ground: and alſo wound their enimies as well in flight, as aſſault. Many of theſe Maures were meruailous readie archers at the croſbowe: and as naturally the Germaines are high of bodie,

and ſlow and laden with fleſh, and the Maures on the other part, very ſkilful in ſhooting, and of like life in ſkirmiſhing: ſo they behaued themſelues no more nor no leſſe with the Germaines, then an archer with a white at a Butt, that is to ſay, without all danger to ſtrike the ſame all to péeces. Although the Romaines were few, yet in their martial affayres they had proſperous beginning, and no leſſe hope of good ſucceſſe: but ye 
                  Germaines, admitting they were many, yet fought they with great miſfortune: becauſe the Romanes were men of experience, but the Germaines chiefly practiſed manuring the fields. Notwithſtanding the Germaines did repent them of their warlike attempts, and Alexander not miſliking his perſonall iourney: yet the good prince forgat not to requeſt them, and alſo pray them with peace: for which purpoſe, he ſent vnto them wiſe Embaſſadors, that on his behalfe ſhould ſay vnto them very good woords, and offer large rewards, with a general pardon of all iniuries: this did hée, not for feare, but yet with ſome doubt of fortunes variableneſſe, which in warlike attēpts diſcouereth her dealing with moſt vncertaintie. The Germaines moſt times beginne their warres with choler, and proſecute the ſame with furie: but in the end, they endure to be perſuaded by requeſts, &amp; to be ouercome with monie. During the time that the Embaſſadours practiſed peace, they eſtabliſhed a truce betwixt both armies, whereat the Romane hoſtes were amazed, and no leſſe eſcandalized: for that as then being fleſhed vpon the Germaines, they would reuenge all iniuries, and alſo rob them of their goods.
               
                  In Alexanders armie there was a Capteine named Maximius, borne in Thracia, in linage obſcure, in condition barbarous, of inclination vicious, in office a manſleyar, and a robber on highe wayes: who, for his valiauntneſſe in warrelike affayres, came by all the degrées of cheualrie to haue ye charge of men of warre. And to conſider a meruailous matter of this Maximius, which is to ſay: yt as Nature was his aduerſarie in depriuing him of vertues natural, ſo was Fortune his fauourer in all variable chaunces:

becauſe, then fortune ſheweth her greatnes, when ſuch as be of ſmall valure, are aduanced to the poſſeſſion of mightie thinges. The Romanes conſidering howe Alexander practiſed peace with the Germaines, and that the truce cō
                     tinuing, he gaue himſelfe vnto pleaſure and vice, all ſpoyle and robbing of enimies being remoued, agréed amongeſt themſelues to create Maximius Emperour, &amp; to murther their lord and Emperour Alexander. The caſe was thus, that Maximius being in the fields, teaching certaine yonge men to play at weapons, the confederate traytours came vnto him, and taking Maximius amongeſt them, apparelled him with the robe and enſigne of the Empire: who being ignoraunt of their intent, and ſuppoſing it to be done in ieaſt, vſed ſome reſiſtance. But, when Maximius perceiued his promotion to be no matter of ieſt, he determined to kill the true Emperour in earneſt: wherof Alexander (all careleſſe in his tente) being aduertiſed, began to chaunge countenance as one ſore abaſhed, and his mother alſo to fall a wéeping. The generous and valiant gentlemen that Alexander had with him, hee did requeſt and perſuade to reſiſt the traitour Maximius, and as good vaſſals &amp; frends, in this caſe to liue and die with him: which they all promiſed, but afterwards obſerued not.
               
               
                  The next day early in the morning, it was ſaid vnto Alexander, that Maximius came accompanied with all the armie: whereuppon Alexander demaunding armour to iſſue forth to fight, there was not one mā found that would follow: for yt all his men of warre were returned to Maximius, and the moſt of his ſeruauntes that night were fled. When Maximius came within the viewe of the imperiall tent, where Alexander remayned, he ſtoode ſtill, and commaunded certaine Capitaines to goe to Alexander, not to take, but to kill him: &amp; that by no meanes they ſhould giue him ſpace or place to do any déed, or ſtay to heare any of his words: for that many times delayes in like caſes bring to paſſe, that hee that ſhould haue died, doth kill him that ſhould haue liued.
                  
               
               
                  
                  When Maximius his Captaines came vnto Alexanders tente, he was blaming his mother, ſaying, that by her auarice and couetouſnes hée loſt both life and honour: but his complaintes, and her lamentations extended to ſmal purpoſe: for that ioyntly they ſlue the ſonne, and mangled the mother all to péeces. Herodianus (in his Romane hiſtories) ſayth, that this chaunce and death happened vnto Alexander: but other Hiſtoriographers, no leſſe graue and true, although they ſay that hee died in Germanie, yet ſay not that he was ſubdued in Aſia: moreouer, the occaſion of his death they report after another maner: becauſe Herodianus knewe not otherwiſe to excuſe the treaſon committed by Maximius, but to ſay, for that Alexander had béene ouercome, he was odious vnto all the armie.
               
            
            
               CHAP. X. ¶Of a ſolemne Oration made by Alexander vnto his men of warre.
               WHen Alexander departed from Rome to goe into the warres of Aſia, hée had great regard vnto his men of warre, as well for their ſafetie, as alſo for robbing ſuch countries as they were to paſſe: for, as naturall is it for men of warre to rob their neighbours, as to kill enimies. When hée did eate, he had alwayes his tente open: to the end all men of his hoſt ſhould both ſée and knowe, that the meate which he did eate, had more taſte of the ſharpneſſe of the warres, then of the delicateneſſe of Rome. Nightly hee did viſite the circuite of his campe: and at all times would giue them falſe alarmes, to yéeld them aptneſſe vnto armour, and readineſſe to repaire vnto their enſignes. If any perſon did wander from his ſtandard, either to rob, or but ſo much as to walke, the qualitie of the perſon conſidered, hee receiued puniſhment more or leſſe.
               If any were a brabler with his hoſte, froward with his

companions, diſobedient vnto his officers, tooke any thing by violence, or was foule mouthed, hee would ſay theſe woords vnto him: 
                     wouldeſt thou, that as thou doeſt, they ſhould doe, or as thou ſayeſt, they ſhould ſay vnto thee? Knoweſt thou not the prouerbe of the Chriſtians, Quod tibi nō vis, alteri ne feceris, that is, what thou wilt not to thy ſelfe, do not to another. Alexander ſaid that he heard this Prouerbe ſpoken, and he wiſt not whether of the Iewes or Chriſtians: whiche in his heart tooke ſuch déepe impreſſion, that he did not onely ſpeake and repeate, but alſo many times wrote the ſame vnto his gouernours: and further, cauſed them to be drawen vppon his enſignes, and grauen vpon all his workes. Alexander being reſident in the territories of Antioche, was informed that a certaine Capitaine had abuſed an auncient woman, both in woord and déede: and both being called into his preſence, and the matter heard, he commaunded the Capitaine to be depriued of his roome and office, and of the liberties which hee had receiued in Rome: and further, that hee ſhould be ſlaue vnto the old woman: furthermore, hee commaunded that in Carpentars craft he ſhould perfourme his ſeruice, &amp; mainteine his old dame.
Hee vſed ſo great ſeueritie and hardneſſe with his men of warre, that many times hee diſpatched them by whole bandes: for that he might not endure their ciuil diſſentions: or robberies, and ſcandals amongeſt neighbours.
               All Romane princes had feare of their armies, except Alexander, and the cauſe why (as he ſaid) hee feared them not, was: for that he payed them very well, and remoued all occaſion of reprehenſion from his owne perſon and life: for in the ende, none hath true libertie to chaſtice, but the man that is of a ſincere life. The armie remayning in Antioche, he was aduertiſed that they gaue themſelues vnto women, haunted hoate houſes, and ſpente and loſt much time in vaine playes and idleneſſe: whereuppon hee commaunded all the Capitaines, Tribunes, and Centurions, to be taken, and with yrons to be caſt into priſon, vppon

which cauſe there grew amongeſt them, no ſmall ſcandal: in ſo much that openly they durſt ſay vnto Alexander, if on that preſent day hee did not let them loſe, the nexte day following they would depart vnto the enimies. Alexander being aduertiſed what his men of warre had ſaid, &amp; what they ment to do, commaunded them all to appeare before his preſēce, both ſuch as were in bonds, as thoſe that were at libertie: ſaying vnto them theſe words.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Alexander his Oration, made to his men of warre, at his commaundement before him ſummoned and aſſembled.
                           Brothers, friends, and my companions, that which now I haue to ſay vnto you, is more for ye loue whiche I beare you, then feare which I haue of you: becauſe, princes that haue feare to execute iuſtice, either it is for that they are vniuſt: or becauſe their ſubiectes ſhould diſſemble their owne proper vices. Howe would ye that I ſhould ſuffer you, being (as ye are) noble Romaines? whom cruell tyrantes would not endure as their ſubiectes? There is none ſo euil, althoughe hee endeuour not to be vertuous, that of the good holdeth not good opinion: wherof followeth, that it is much more euill for the common wealthe, the prince being vertuous, to ſuffer perſons vicious: then him that is vicious, to permit no vice in his common wealth.
                           The prince that conſenteth vnto vices, and diſſembleth with vicious perſons, is not to be named a pitifull father, but a peruerſſe and a cruell tyraunte:

for that, notwithſtanding at the preſent hee doeth not chaſtice them, yet in proceſſe the one ſhall deſtroy the other. One vicious, with another that is vicious, may neuer long continue in friendſhip: for preſently vpon the decay of vice, at the inſtant their friendſhip faileth. Being (as I am) your prince according to iuſtice, and your brother in loue, how would ye that I ſhould ſuffer you to rauiſh women, play your wages away at dice, ſpoile orchardes, with other ſuch like vile &amp; heynous deeds? Admitting that now I would paſſe and diſſemble the ſame, yet doubtleſſe, your ſelues before others would blame &amp; condemne ye ſame: becauſe this tribute the good haue ouer the euill, that if they bee greeued with the chaſtiſement giuen vnto the euill, in the end they ſhall ſome day praiſe him yt did iuſtice. Vnderſtand ye not that ye are gentlemen of Rome? and that on the day in which any man taketh the name of a Romane, hee bindeth himſelfe to bee vertuous? Becauſe this name of Romanes, was not ſo much magnified of our predeceſſours, by killing enimies in Aſia, as by weeding vices out of oure common wealthes.
                           Wee call the Perſians, Barbarians, becauſe they haue taken that which was ours: and doubt ye that of Romanes, they ſhall not intitle vs tyrantes, that haue ſpoyled others? I am named Alexander, and would imitate Alexander the great: of whome, and of his father king Philip it is ſaid, that when they brought foorth their armies to fighte, they ſeemed more a Senate in the common wealth, then men of warre. If they had done what ye nowe haue done, neuer might thoſe princes haue obteined ſo great victories of their enimies, either writers ſo largely to haue regiſtred

their noble and glorious deedes, either might I haue prayſed them with ſo good wordes: whereof foloweth, that the chiefeſt effecte to ouerthrowe enimies, is, to holde armies verie well diſciplined. Princes vſe to loſe manie victories, not for want of iuſtified war, but becauſe their men of warre are wicked: and admittinge that ſome times euill men do conquere, yet in the end they ſhal be vanquiſhed, or elſe of the gods cruelly chaſticed. Let them be certeine, that are either preſent or abſent, if anie one will be euill, either let him returne vnto his houſe, or elſe we ſhal chaſten him if he remaine vnder our ſtandard: becauſe it is not iuſte that wee, comminge to recouer that whiche is vſurped from the common wealth, by bearinge with your woorkes, ſhoulde defame our mother Rome. If we ſuffer ſo manie trauels, aduenture our ſelues in ſo manie perills, and conſume our treaſures, it is not for wante of oyle, wheate, wine, plate, or golde, but to magnifie the renowme of the Romaine Empire: and ſince it is ſo, howe is it poſſible for the Gods to permitt, that by the handes of infamous perſons, we ſhould obteine honour or renoune. Numa Pompilius, Quintus Cincinnatus, Marcus Marcellus, Paulus Emilius, Quintus Fabius, Cneus Fabricius, and Scipio Africanus brought to paſſe, with the Gods that the Romaine empire was accepted, and that through the worlde the name of Rome was reuerēced: we read not in hiſtories that theſe glorious and noble men, in their perſons were tyrants, and muche leſſe woulde conſente their armies to be vicious. Beleeue me, friends and companions, Princes that will mainteine the fame of good Princes, and not recouer the reproche of tyrantes, ought to haue

as greate care to preſerue their armies from vice, as to auoyde the treaſon of enimies: for that men do incurre greater daunger by ſecrete vices, then by open enimies. That whiche ye haue done, is either good or euill: and if robbinge of fieldes, rayſinge of mutinies, and forceing of women, be good: then by this accompt, to honour temples, defende orphans, ſacrifice vnto the Gods, and to vſe iuſtice with all people, is wicked: ſince the lawes whiche condemne the one, allowe the other: whiche of all you is neither to be beleued, either ſo muche as once to be thought: for, not withſtandinge of euill we can ſay but euil: yet is it muche worſe to defende, then do it. If theſe inſolencies whiche I haue rehearſed, and you haue committed, ye holde for euill: why conceiue ye not the chaſticemente giuen for the ſame, to be good? If vertue and rewarde be couſines, who wil denie that the treſpaſſe &amp; ye puniſhment are brethren? He that ordeyned the conquerour to triumph, hath he not appointed the theefe to be hanged? Will ye be paide before hande, for ſeruice vnperfourmed? and will ye neither pay or reſtore that whiche ye haue purloyned?
                           Notwithſtanding Princes haue greate libertie in the cōmon wealth, yet are they not exempted or free frō iuſtice: and will men of warre only be priuileged? The wordes whiche ye haue vttered, and the threatninges which ye haue thundered, neither do I take them as iniuries, or yeald my ſelf to anie grieuous agonie: for in killinge me, ye ſhall kill but one: yet in the ende, there ſhall not wante in the Empire, one to ſucceede mee, and alſo to chaſtice you.
                           That whiche I preſently requeſte and commaund

you, is, to amende that whiche is paſt, preſentely to imbrace quietneſſe, and to be aduiſed in time to come: whiche if ye refuſe, I ſhall be forced to vſe rigour, becauſe I am not to ſupporte mine Empire, by relieuing vicious ſouldiours, but in maintenance of all men by iuſtice.
                        
                     
                  
               
               Theſe and ſuch wordes beeing ſaide, they became al milde and pacified: and further, all armour beeing laide a parte, in token of obedience: and their heades caſte downe, in ſigne of ſorrowe: euerie man departed vnto his charge. Hereby, the greate authoritie of Alexander in his commaundements is to bee gathered: and the force whiche he had in his perſuadinge ſpeache, to be pondered. The bande and capteineſhip which he diſmiſſed, after xxx. dayes he did bothe pardon and admitte them: becauſe hee ſawe in them greate repentaunce, for that which was paſt, and readie mindes to ſerue him in time to come: and ſo it came to paſſe, that afterwardes in battell they proued men moſt notable, and ſuch in déede, as to whome greateſt glorie was giuen.
            
            
               CHAP. XI. ¶Of the victorie that Alexander obteined againſt the Perſians, and of his triumph, as ſome writers do report.
               WHen Alexander departed from Rome, becauſe of the warres in Aſia, a great part of Summer was paſt: for which cauſe, it was neceſſarie for him to Winter in Antioche: admitting ye delay increaſeth coſt, yet was it profitable for perfourmance of his warlike attempts: for that

in mene time, he reformed his armies, prouided victuals, repayred high wayes, recouered manie daungerous paſſages, and alſo remoued from his enimie manie confederates. When ſummer began, Alexander marched with his armie: after whoſe entrance into the lande of Perſia, he perfourmed al exploites accuſtomed in ſuche a iourney: which is to wéete, brake bridges, ouerthrewe fortes, burned houſes, ſacked townes, ſpoyled fieldes, killed men, and did captiuate women: whereof we haue not to meruell, for that notwithſtandinge warre be iuſtified, and all thinges iuſte therein demaunded, yet alwayes the déedes thereof be moſte vniuſte. Certeine dayes beeing paſt, wherin were trauerſed diuers daungerous ſkirmiſhes, and no leſſe perilous incounters, by the conſente of Alexander and Artaxerxes, they committed both their fortunes vnto the merite of a battell: the Perſians being ouerthrowen, and the Romains remaining conquerours: wherein, if Artaxerxes had ſtaide his hardineſſe, and commended the matter vnto policie, placeing his power in his fortes and moſte ſtronge places: if he had ſuffered the Romaines by tracte of time to conſume thēſelues, according to the cuſtome of greate armies, in ſtraunge countries: he might haue preſerued, both his countrie and honour. Great riches were recouered in that battell, and infinite the captiues whiche then were taken: and as the Perſians holde it for a moſte greate iniurie to ſerue any ſtraunge nation, ſo Artaxerxes, notwithſtandinge hee was poore and ouercome, gathered together greate ſummes of money, and redéemed all captiues: in ſuche wiſe, that in Perſia there remained no money, either anie captiues came vnto Rome.
               
               
                  Alexander recouered in thoſe warres, the renoume of valiant, magnanime, and not couetous: and he was iuſtely intituled valiaunt, for his doughtineſſe in fighting: magnanime, for his magnificent liberalitie: and not couetous, for the ſmall ſhare that he reſerued vnto him ſelfe.
               
                  The affaires of Perſia beeing diſpatched. Alexander returned vnto Rome, entering the ſame with greate triumph, and glorie: for that conformable vnto the people and nation which they had ſubdued, was the riches that was brought vnto the treaſurie. And after being mounted vpon the Capitol, he ſaide vnto the Senate, after this manner.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           A ſhorte Oration made to the Senate.
                           
                           Fathers Conſcript, for that I come tyred with ſo long a iourney, and you no leſſe wearied in receiuing mee, it were no reaſon to make long ſpeache, muche leſſe to inuent newe eloquence: becauſe there is nothing ſo eloquently ſpoken, but if it bee ſaide out of time or place, ſeemeth tedious vnto the audience. He that ſhall ſpeake, or perſuade others, hath not only to conſider what he ſaith, but alſo to obſerue time, and reſpect the aſſemblie: for the Sea at one time, doth permitt her ſelfe to be ſpurned: and at another time not to bee touched. By that which ye haue hearde, as that which this day ye haue ſeene, ye may vnderſtand howe daungerous this warre hath beene, and howe copious a victorie we haue obteined: for as ye vnderſtand (Fathers conſcript) there is no great harueſt, without great tillage.
                           The caſe is thus, that the Perſians had in their fauour foure ſcore thouſand footemen, ſixe thouſand horſſemen, ſeuen hundreth Elephants, two thouſand yron cartes, and two thouſand ſlaues that were young men: the one halfe to beare victuals, and the other halfe to mend high wayes.
                           
                              On that day in which both the one &amp; the other came foorth into the fielde to fight, no man woulde haue thought, but yt the whole world had bene come together, and alſo the deade riſen out of their graues. Of foote men we ſlewe twentie thouſande, and did captiuate twentie thouſande, of horſe men two thouſande were killed, and three thouſande did yealde, of Elephantes we bringe three hundred, and three hundred we haue ſlaine: the cartes, the ſlaues, and priſoners, they haue redeemed by the weight of money, in ſuch wiſe, that we haue taken their countries, ouercome their perſons, and brought away their goods. I returne ſafe &amp; ſound, ye armie inriched, king Artaxerxes defeated, the name of Rome magnified, and the confederates ſatiſfied: and with all theſe trauels though we come wearied, yet are we not fatigated: becauſe victorie is ſo ſweete a thing, that it leadeth al trauells paſt into obliuion.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  Alexander hauing ſaide theſe wordes, the Senate exclaimed with loude voices.
               
                  The immortal Gods ſaue thee Alexander, the Gods make thy fame immortall, ſince this day thou haſte honoured Rome with euerlaſtinge fame. Thou haſt ouercome the Perſians, viſited the Parthians, ſubdued kinges, inriched the armies, and placed vs in great honour: for which cauſe, not vnworthily, we intitle thee Pater Patriae father of our countrie, Tribune of the people, moſt highe Biſhoppe, firſt Conſul, &amp; only Emperour of the worlde.
               
               Theſe &amp; ſuch other exclamations manifeſted by the Senate, at the iſſue of the Capitol gate, Alexander ſaide vnto all perſons that there did attend him.
               
                  Fathers, ſonnes, brothers, and companions vnto

the fathers of the Senate, we haue giuen accompt of all that we haue done, and will giue you a reaſon, as apperteineth, of al that we haue ſaide. For this day, the triumph paſte ſufficeth: to morowe, we wil viſite the temples: the nexte daye, we will offer greate ſacrifices: the fourth day, wee will giue libertie vnto priſoners: the fifte day, we will diuide rewardes amongſt the poore widowes, and orphans: the ſixte day, we wil begin ye Perſike &amp; Circen playes: for cō
                     ſidering the greatneſſe of our victorie, we wil firſt accompliſhe with the Gods, by whom we haue obteined the ſame: and then with men which gaue vs their aſsiſtance.
               
               When Alexander came from the Capitol, hee mounted on horſe backe to ride vnto his palace: whome, at that inſtante, certeine auncient gentlemen of Rome did take &amp; beare vpon their ſhoulders, the people gathered together exclaminge with lowde voyces, in this manner.
               
                  Bleſſed is Mamea thy mother, bleſſed art thou Alexander her ſonne, bleſſed is Rome yt bred thee, bleſſed is ye armie that elected thee, and bleſſed is ye Senate yt did conſecrate thee: for in thee is conteyned ye felicitie of Octauius, &amp; the bountie of Traiane. Thou haſt lead with thee into the warres, our huſbands, our ſonnes, and our friendes, whome thou bringeſt backe with thee all ſounde, all riche, and likewiſe all contē
                     ted: wherfore, we ſay vnto thee, that if this day we place thee vpon our ſhoulders, for euer more we will lay vp thy memorie in our entrayles.
               
               In theſe exclamations the people continued, before and behinde, for the ſpace of fower houres, extremly peſtering all paſſage, vntill the chariote triumphant, with foure Elephants, made the wayes open. All yt which he ſaide vnto ye people, he commaunded preſently to be accompliſhed.
               
                  At the ende of theſe feaſtes, he did inſtitute a temple of Virgines, who were named Maneaes, in reuerence of his mother Manea. At the ſame time he receiued newes, that at Tanger a citie of Africa, Furius Celſus had obteined victorie, and Iunius Palinatus likewiſe in Armenia triumphed ouer the enimies, as alſo Varius Macrinus in Illyria had made a conqueſt of certeine countries: and the currers which brought ye newes, preſented him alſo with thrée tables of Lawrell. The feaſtes and triumphes being finiſhed, he woulde be informed of the officers of the common wealth, that is to ſay: how in his abſence they had vſed the people, and howe they had adminiſtred iuſtice: and ſuche as had not done well, he remoued: and thoſe that had done well, he rewarded: giuinge vnto ſome more honourable offices, and to others heritages and money. Manie times Alexander woulde ſay, that they deſerued as greate glorie that in time of warre did well gouerne the common wealth, as they whiche in the warres obteined victorie.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XII. Of thinges whiche he did in Rome, and howe the tyrant Maximius did kill him in Britaine.
               AFter that Alexander had ſubdued and triumphed ouer the Perſians, certeine dayes he was deteined in the gouernement and refourmation of the cōmon wealth: becauſe the longe abſence of princes breedeth wante of
                     iuſtice amongſt the multitude. Of all the riches that he brought from the warres of Aſia, he did take for him ſelfe, but one horſe, one chariot, foure Elephantes, one ſworde, one cuppe of Ius, and a paper of poinctes, which belonged vnto kinge Artaxerxes: for as he ſaide, The pray of princes, ought to be imployed on princes.
                  
The

defence of the moſt daungerous frontiers, he commended not but vnto men yt had great wealth in the ſame: which if he had not, he gaue it them in ſuch wiſe, that to conſerue his fidelitie which he did owe, &amp; to ſaue his goods which he poſſeſſed, he ſhould be forced to defende his countrie, or dye in the enterpriſe.
               There was in Rome in thoſe dayes a Mathematiciā, named Thraſibulus, of whō 
                  Alexander demaunded what death he ſhould dye: who aunſwered: thou ſhalt dye in a ſtraunge countrie, not in thine olde age, but by ye ſwoorde of a Barbarian: whereat Alexander was nothing altered, but rather with excéeding ioy imbracing Thraſibulus ſaid:

                     
                        
                           
                              A certeine ſpeach of Alexander againſt the terrour of death.
                              If the Gods did graunt vnto other princes to liue perpetually, and commaund mee onely to dye, I confeſſe I ſhould dolefully feele the deede of death: but our life being (as it is) ſo ſhorte, and death ſo neceſſarie: I had rather dye in the field by the handes of mine enimies, then in my chamber compaſſed with Phyſicians. Vnto the greatneſſe of Princes it appertaineth, not onely to lead a good life, but alſo elect an honourable death: and to this ende I ſay vnto thee Thraſibulus, that all ye felicitie of a Prince conſiſteth in well gouerning the common wealth, and alſo to imploye his life for the ſame. What fame, or glorie, what eaſe or quietneſſe, doth followe the life of that Prince which dieth in his olde yeres, and ſickely? in which age, for the moſt parte, olde men be euil ſerued of their ſubiectes, and contemned of ſtraungers. He that conceiueth it to bee good for the prieſt to dye in the temple, conceiueth no leſſe of the Prince that dyeth in the field: for that the office of the one is to praye, &amp; of the other to fight.
                              
                                 I haue ſeene many dye here in Rome, after the manner which the common people do thinke the beſt kinde of death: that is to ſaye, laden with yeares, laide in their beddes, accompanied with ſonnes, honoured of parents, compaſſed with ſonnes in lawe, viſited of Phyſicians, and ſerued of nephues: at whoſe death, I beare no enuie: ſince I knewe of them, that before their bodies were taſted of woormes, their hearts were vnbowelled with griefe &amp; thought.
                              Thraſibulus, thou doeſt well knowe, that Alexander, Darius, Hector, Pompeyus, Gayus, Tullius, Seneca, and Demoſthenes, were men in their perſons verie glorious, in doctrines verie wiſe, and in their deedes no leſſe heroycall: and yet all theſe with many others dyed, not accōpanied with their friends, but by the handes of their enimies: neither were they blemiſhed with ſo vntimely a death, ſince of them nothing was leſſe eſteemed: but rather by their cruell deaths, they aduaunced their fames. No other thing is diuers in death, but onely the manner of the ſame, ſithence death in the ende is alwayes but one thinge: for we ſhould not be afflicted with the manner of our death: but what thinges we ſhould repaire, to the amēdement of our life. Admitting that theſe cōſiderations, apperteine more vnto Philoſophers, then vnto the ſimple: yet I ſaye both to thee and other, that as it was not in our handes to be borne, ſo ſhal not the manner of our death conſiſt in our ſelues: but yt houre being arriued, there and then ſhall euery man finde for him ſelfe, what fortune hath prouided.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  All theſe thinges Alexander ſaide vnto Thraſibulus in ſecrete, and afterwards openly in the hearing of all men. Not manie dayes after theſe thinges paſſed, Alexander departed vnto the warres of Germanie, which were not proſecuted in Germanie, but in Gallia tranſalpina: for becauſe the French men were ſubiect vnto the Romains, the Germaines did inuade them. Alexander beeing in the greateſt heate of theſe warres, certeine mutinous ſouldiours and olde ſeruantes of Heliogabalus, did create a capteine, named Maximius, Emperour: béecauſe the Emperour Alexander woulde not conſente, but vtterly deteſted their horrible and vicious actes. Alexander remaining in the leſſer Britaine in a place named Cilicia, Maximius &amp; his trayterous adherentes determined to kill him their Lorde and Emperour, before it might be manifeſted through the armies: for yt, notwithſtanding diuers of them did doubt his ſeueritie, yet on the other parte all perſons did loue his iuſtice.
               
                  Alexander repoſinge at after noone, ye traytours agreed with a ieſter to murther him in his tente: who beeing entred, fel into ſuch diſmay, that he not only gaue ouer his determined attempt vnperfourmed, but alſo fledde with no ſmall doubt and feare affrighted. But beeing afterwardes retyred vnto Maximius and his companions, perſuaded them preſently to kill Alexander, beeing at that time on his bedde ſolitarie and vnaccompanied, for that other wiſe he woulde diſcouer their whole intente: which he ſaide, becauſe it was A lawe Martiall, that anie which ſhoulde aduenture to enter the tente of the prince without licence, ſhoulde pay no leſſe then the loſſe of his life. Maximius and his complices conſideringe what the ieſter had ſaide, preſently determined to murther their Lorde and Emperour Alexander: and ſo ioyntly and furiouſly entringe his tente, ſlewe both him, his mother, and all perſons that made reſiſtance, or ouerthwarted them

with anie diſpleaſaunt ſpeache. Alexander died one the twelfth of Iune, after thirteene yeres &amp; nine dayes of his Empire were expired: he liued twentie &amp; nine yeres, three moneths, and ſeuen dayes: and was a Prince in Rome moſte loued in his life, and moſt bewayled at his death. The enimies of Alexander did note him, that he deſpiſed in him ſelfe to be natiue in Aſſyria, that he loued gold, inuented newe tributes, was ſeuere with ſouldiours, did what he could to reſemble Alexander Magnus, and that he was ſomewhate ſuſpicious. But the thing wherefore Alexander was moſt blamed, and iuſtly deſerued to bee noted, was, that being a man, and of greate experience in the gouernement of the Empire, he continued ſubiect vnto his mother, as when he was a childe: and in this caſe it was ſufficient, that he had reuerenced and honoured her as a mother: and on the other parte to haue conſidered, that her counſell in the ende, was but of a woman. Alexander was ſo vniuerſally beloued of all nations of the Empire, that it chaunced at his death, which neuer was read to haue chaunced at the death of any Prince of the worlde, that is to ſaye: that they were all ſlaine which brought the newes of his death: neither the commaundements of commiſſions of his ſucceſſour, woulde they obey: aduouchinge it to bee blaſphemie in the place of ſo vertuous a Prince, to yelde obedience vnto a traytour ſo deteſtable.
