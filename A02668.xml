            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

numbre) yet are they in daylye custome / God
not feared / nor yet ther danger consydered.
And why? They that shuld be
the salte of the earth / are become vnsaverye / and
wher as they ought to geue
vs the lyght of good lyuinge / they offre
vs darkenesse. Neyther is the corrupciō
of execrable swearinge taken from vs

But if a pore man begynneth
to fauer the verite of the lord / they cane
smelle hym owt though he be .xl. myle
of. But with these thinges wyl they not
meadle. And why? they are bothe necessarye
for a comon wealth. By good hansome
swearinge men appere valeaunte / and
no faynt harted cowerdes. The stewes
ar permitted / as an wholesome polytique
ordinance / to auoyed a greatter

Faythful wyfes wyll cōtinue in ther

shall go to the deuyll. It geueth rather
an occasion to wyfes / and maydēs to be

to be an whore / she knoweth wher to be
receyued. Manye a mayde lykewyse / when

ended betwen neyboure and neyboure / through
an othe. It is also a meane
wherby promyses ar perfourmed.Gen. 21. As
we fynd in Genesis the .21. chapter / the
wordes of Abimelech vnto Abraham / that
he shuld neyther hurte hym / nor
his posterite / vnto whom Abrahā sayde / I
wyl sweare. And the texte sayeth / that
thei sware bothe. And Abraham ded not
onlye sweare / but also perfourmed it indede.
This is called a ryght or lawfull
othe / and none elles.A laufull othe. This othe is a certen
kynde of religion / wherwith god is
not onlye honored / but also / well contented
and pleased. This is a sure anchore / wherunto
iudges may lawfully stycke / whan
ther wyttes can go no furder. For
who knoweth what is in man / but God
onlye? This right and lawfull othe was

commanded of god for the conforte / helpe / and
secoure of owr neyboure. And it
is called the othe of the lord / not onlye
because he commāded it / but also whan
he made his myghtye promesse vnto Abrahā
he sweare hym self / to cause hym
to beleue it / not to be impossyble / at the

the Manacheis / whose folowers ar now

because they vnderstand not the sentence
of Christ in the .v. of Matthew. This
worde / iurare / hath an other maner of signification / than
they do perceyue / and
is otherwyse taken in the said .v. of Mathew / than
they do teache. for this is to

saith / thou shalt not sweare at al / he meaneth
nothinge lesse / than by it / to destroy
all maner of lawfull swearinge before
a iudge / but that we shuld neuer in our
priuate communicacion sweare. and as
all maner of othes ware not disalowed

of God the father / but suche onely as
had eyther the glory of God / the profyt
of owre neyboure / or the commō wealth

it was sayd to thē of the olde tymene

periurare can neuer be taken in a good

wyfe / was no synne with them / no more
was it to thinke one thinge in the harte
and to speake another with the mouth.
Althoughe Moyses sayd lye not: nor deceyue
any man his neighbour.Leuit. 19 They did
interpretate it but for good councel / and
that it did bynd no man / vnder payne of
dānacion. so by that meanes were there
none beleued / onles they toke god to witnesse.
whan false / sotel and craftye merchauntes

ones perceiued that for taking
of Goddes name to recorde / they were
beleued / whatsoeuer their cause was.
To bringe their matter to passe they lytle
cared to forsweare them selues. vnder
that coloure cloked they all maner
of dissimulacion / falshede / and vngodlynesse.
so that the name of God (whiche
ought to haue ben had in most reuerēce)
was commonlye than vsed / for a coueringe
of all their myschefes. in so moch
the Prophete complayned and sayde / how
they cowed saye the Lorde lyueth / yet
did they sweare to deceyue.Ierem. 5. Christ
commeth / and bringeth salte and light
vnto the commandementes / restoringe
them agayne to their owne natural meaninge / and
right vnderstanding / and as
his father wolde haue them kept / of euery
Christen man. for as God is but one / so
hath his word or commaundementes
but one right and trewe meaninge / how
so euer we turmoyle or handle them.Goddes worde hath but one true meaninge.
And where as they had taught to hate
in harte / to couer another mans wyfe / &amp;
to deceyue his neighboure with a lye / was
not forbidden of God / vnder payne
of damnacion but only the outwarde acte.
But Christe saith / he that is angrye
with his brother / is in daunger of iudgement.

markewel this short sentence of myne.
God will not gyne power to anye man
to do or performe that thinge whiche is
not done after his worde / and here by
an othe contrarye goddes commaundement
dost thou bynde thy self / to do that
thinge which is not in thy power to do / neither
hast thou God vpon thy syde to

gyue the strength to doo it / because it is
not doone (althoughe it were neuer so
trewe) before a iudge / whiche Goddes
worde requireth. And so doest thou lose
thy saluacion / and fredome in Christe.
with his name sealest thou an obligacion / to
do that thinge / wherby thou arte
defeated of all thyne inheritaunce. Is
this thinkeste thou a pleasaunte thinge
vnto him? All this set a parte / yf it shuld
chaunce that some worldly trouth were
not in thy wordes / (besydes conscience)
thou shuldest vtterly bleamishe the opinion
of thy faith / and to shame thy Lord
Iesus / whom thou hast taken to wytnes
with the / for thy truthe and honeste.1. Tim. 6. In
this also doest thou testifie / that thou beleuest
him to be no righteous God / nor
yet a iudge that will ones before al the
worlde condempne thy suttel trade of
falshed and hypocrisie.
            Finally thou makest as though God
were well contented with thy dissimulacion / and
as thoughe he had a greate
sporte at the matter / to se thy crafty conueyaunce
and legerdemayne in compassinge

to deceyue him with an othe / for whom
Christ spared not to gyue his lyfe / and

Thinke thā it is lawful for the to swear
by no maner of thinge / for thy pleasure / neyther
by heauen nor earth deuyll / nor

nay is playnly of wyckednes. Our wordes
are the outward testimonies of our

to be so substanciall / as to be worthye a
beleue without an othe. So syngle and
pure ought our loue to be towardes our
neighboure in oure dayely occupyenge / that

no maner of crafte shuld be founde
therein. Damnable it ware to deceyue
oure brother with alye / and moche more
dampnable to seale it with a false
othe.We ought to be no lō
                  ger babes. They of the olde tyme thought it
no faute to sweare in a matter of truth / but
we haue now a newe scole master / and
ought by his owne doctryne / to be
no longer babes / but to be moche more
perfyght then they ware. Now ought
suche brotherly loue to reygne amonge
vs / that one shulde haue no stomake / harte / nor
desyre / to hyndre / hurte / or displease
another. The eye shuld seke the
profyte of the hande / and the hande the
commodite of the foote / as membres of

so faythfull to the other / that neyther
shuld he nede to sweare / nor the other
nede to put hym to an othe. And suerlye
ther is none othe made betwene neyboure
and neyboure / but one of them / or
bothe offendeth dedly. And it is he that
heareth the trewth and wyl not beleue

hym to sweare / or elles the other
that without all occasyō / inforceth him

            Customable swearinge is verye dangerous / though
we ded not lye at al / for
so moche as it doth depriue the nameEccle. 23

feare. And so moch vanite of wordes is
in our dayly commoninge &amp; occupienge
that we haue one with another / that we
can not chose but lye in many thinges.Prouer. 10
Which to confirme with an oth / though
we intende no fraude / is to take the holy
name of God in vayne / and vnreuerently
to vse it against the second commaundemente.

               Committed to you for a season.

               As equyte wylleth and good reason
               Iesus Syrac taught this lesson.
               To set a locke wher many handes be / 
               It is no shame ner dishonestie.

               That ydilnesse maye be refused
               
                  
Great mens howses are accused.

               With pryde / with oothes / &amp; with excesse.
