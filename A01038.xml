            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               IN ſome Few written Copies of the first ſudden draught of this WARNING, before it was perfected, ſome haske ſpeaches were found, and haue beene verie hasklie interpreted. I loue not to bee offenſiue to anie; and I doe playnlie and openlie diſallow all other Copies, and holde to this onlie perfect Edition, in a meeke and calme ſtile: beſeeching my de we Countrey-men, to pardon what was amiſſe in anie Copie, or what perhaps may bee yet amiſſe in this first publicke and onlie true Edition; which I doe preſens vnto them, with a loving and peaceable heart, ayming onlie at Trueth and Peace.

And let not anie exception agaynst anie weakneſſe of the Warner, hinder them from vnpartiall conſideration of the Warning it ſelfe. The Apostle hath tolde vs, that the wrath of man, worketh not

Which to obtayne, let vs all ſearch and trye our wayes, and turne agayne to the LORD. Let vs lift vp our heart with our handes vnto GOD in the Heavens. Now, the Lam. 3. 40.

            A Peaceable WARNING, To the Subjects in SCOTLAND, Given in the year of GOD 1638.
            
               CHAP. 1. A true Historicall Narration, Concerning our Nationall Confeſsion of Fayth, registrated in Parliament: and concerning that other little Confeſſion, called Generall; which was alſo called The King's Confeſsion, and the Negatiue Confeſsion, contayning the Oath.
               
                  MASTER IOHN KNOX of happie memorie, with others his Fellow-labourers, in the Reformation of Religion in SCOTLAND, did preſent in name of the Nationall reformed Kirke of this Realme, vnto the Parliament; a Confeſſion of Fayth, diſtinguiſhed into 25 Articles: which was read in face of

Parliament, and ratified by the three Eſtates, in the yeare of GOD 1560, as a Doctrine grounded vpon the infallible Word of GOD. And agayne, the ſame Confeſsion and fore-ſayde Act made in ratification thereof, were ratified, approved, and authorized, in the firſt Parliament of KING IAMES the ſixt of bleſſed memorie, holden at EDINBVRGH, in December, Anno 1567, as it is extant in the publicke Printed Acts of the ſayde Parliament; and Acts were made in that and others ſucceeding Parliaments, for mayntayning of the ſayde Confeſſion, and agaynſt the gayn-ſayers, and diſobedient, as you may reade in the Acts of thoſe Parliaments, Act. 4. 5. 6. 9. 35. 45. 46. 47. 99. 106. &amp;c.
               
               Yet ſtill with that modeſtie and ingenuitie which the Eſtates, and all profeſſing IESUS CHRIST, and His holie EVANGELL in this Realme, did declare, in their Epiſtle written to their owne natiue Countrey-men, and to other Kingdomes and Nations profeſſing with them the ſame IESUS CHRIST, and prefixed as a Preface to the Latine Edition of the ſayde Confeſſion, as it is extant in the Booke called Corpus &amp; Syntagma confeſſionum, &amp;c. where their words are theſe; Si quis in hac noſtra Confeſſione articulum vel ſententiam repugnantem ſancto DEI Verbo notaverit, noſque illius ſcripto admonuerit, promittimus DEI gratia, ex DEI ore, id est, ex ſacris Scripturas, nos illi ſatisfacturos, aut correcturos, ſi quis quid erroris ineſſe probaverit. DEVM enim in conſcientiis noſtris teſtem advocamus, nos ex animo omnes ſectas, Haereſes, omneſque falſae doctrinae doctores deteſtari, &amp;c: that is; If in this our Confeſsion anie man ſhall note anie Article or Sentence repugnant to GOD'S holie Word, and ſhall by wryting admoniſh vs thereof, wee promiſe, by the grace of GOD, to giue him ſatisfaction, out of GOD'S mouth, that is, out of the holie Scriptures, or to amend it, if anie ſhall proue anie errour to bee therein: for we in our conſciences
                  
                  call GOD witneſſe, that wee doe from our heart deteſt all Sects, Hereſies, and all teachers of falſe Doctrine, &amp;c.
               Now, it beeing ordayned by publicke Lawes aboue cited, that all Recuſants, or ſuſpected of Papistrie within this Realme, ſhould giue confeſſion of their fayth according to the forme approved in Parliament, and ſhould aſſent and ſubſcrybe to the Articles of the true and Chriſtian Religion, eſtabliſhed by the King's Lawes; it was found, that manie masked Papistes did promiſe, ſweare, ſubſcrybe, and, for a tyme, vſe the holie Sacraments in the Kirke, deceatfullie, agaynſt their owne conſcience; mynding heereby, firſt vnder the externall cloake of Religion, to corrupt and ſubvert ſecretlie GOD'S true Religion within the Kirke, and afterwardes, when tyme might ſerue, to become open enemies, and Perſecuters of the ſame, vnder vaine hope of the Pop's diſpenſation. Therefore, a certayne Reverend Learned Brother, (whoſe name ſhall hereafter appeare) in his zeale to remeade that evill, for diſcovering and barring out ſuch diſſembling and equivocating Seducers, and Perſecuters, did drawe vp a forme of conſenting to the ſayde Nationall Confeſsion, by way of a Generall Confeſsion of the trueth thereof, in all poynts, and a generall rejection of all contrarie Religion, and Doctrine; with a ſpeciall rehearſall and refuſall of ſundrie Popiſh Erroures, and Superſtitions, particularlie expreſſed; and an acknowledging of this true Reformed Kirke, with an Oath, to continue in the obedience of the Doctrine and Diſcipline thereof: and, according to their calling, and power, to defende the fame, all the dayes of their lyfe: and to keepe duetie to the King's Majeſtie; with ſolemne Proteſtation of the ſincere meaning of them that doe make this Confeſsion, Promiſe, Oath, and Subſcription. And for making eaſier way to this Generall Confeſsion, the King's Majeſtie was

moved to ſubſcrybe the ſame, and his Houſe-holde, to giue example to others: and a Mandate was drawne from his Majeſtie, commanding and charging all Commiſsioners and Miniſters, to craue the ſame Confeſsion of their Parochiners, vnder the payne of fourtie pounds, to bee taken from their Stipend. Subſcryved with his Majeſties hand, at Holy-roode-houſe, the ſecond day of March, in the yeare of GOD 1580; reckoning the yeare to ende at the 25 day of March, but beginning the yeare at Ianuarie, it was 1581, and of the King's reygne the 14 yeare.
               There were there-after, in the ſame yeare 1581, holden two Generall or Nationall Aſſemblies of the Kirke of SCOTLAND, one at GLASGOW, in the Moneth of Aprill, another at EDINBVRGH, in October: In both which there is mention made of this Generall Confeſsion.
               
               In GLASGOW ASSEMBLIE, in the 9 Seſſion, after the ende of the Booke of Policie, are theſe wordes, Anent the Confeſſion latelie ſet foorth by the Kings Majeſties Proclamation, and Subſcrybed by his Highneſſe, the Kirke in one voyce acknowledgeth the ſayde Confeſſion, to bee a true, Chriſtian, and faythfull Confeſſion, to bee agreed vnto by ſuch as truelie profeſſe Chriſt, and his true Religion; and the tenor thereof to bee followed out, as the ſame is layde out in the ſayde Proclamation. Thus farre are the words of that Act of GLASGOW ASSEMBLIE.
               
               Followeth the Act of EDINBƲRGH ASSEMBLIE, Seſsion 5. For as much as the King's Majeſtie, with the advyſe of his Counſell, hath ſet out, and proclaymed, a Godlie and Chriſtian Confeſſion of Fayth, to bee embraced by all his true Subjects, and by the ſame expreſslie given commandement to the Miniſterie, to proceede agaynst whatſoever perſons that will not acknowledge and ſubſcrybe the
                  
                  ſame: wherein great negligence hath beene ſeene, farre by the duetie and office of true Paſtors: Herefore the Kirke, and the Aſſemblie preſent, hath enjoyned and concluded, That all Miniſters and Paſtors within their bounds, with all expedient and poſſible diligence, execute the tenor of his Majeſties Proclamation, betwixt this and the next Synodall Aſſemblie of everie Province, and preſent before the Synodall Aſſemblies, to the Moderators thereof, their duetifull diligence in this behalfe, to bee reported to the next Generall Aſſemblie of the Church; vnder the payne of deprivation of the ſaydes Miniſters from the Function of the Miniſterie, that are found negligent heerein. Thus farre are the words of that Act of that Nationall Aſſemblie holden at EDINBƲRGH, where the penner of the ſayde Generall Confeſsion, was Moderator for the tyme. Heerevpon followed there after ſome moe Subſcriptions.
               
               This Confeſsion, becauſe it was ſet out in the King's Name, was called commonlie, the King's Confeſsion: and becauſe it inſiſteth moſt in rejecting of Erroures, it is alſo called the Negatiue Confeſsion.
               
            
            
               CHAP. II. Concerning the Authoritie of the ſayd little or ſhort Confeſsion, called Generall, and Negatiue.
               
                  THE Authoritie of any ſuch Wryting, is eyther Divine or Humane; for in ſo farre as anie Wryting or Preaching of man hath in it GOD'S vndoubted

Trueth, revealed in His holie SCRIPTVRES, it may bee ſayde, or that Trueth there-in propounded, may bee ſayde to haue Authoritie Divine: becauſe that Trueth doeth obliedge vs, altho no humane authoritie were added there-vnto. This ſort of Authoritie, doeth abſolutelie appertayne onlie to the Canonicke SCRIPTƲRES of the OLD and NEW TESTAMENTS. No other Wryting, or Preaching, hath it Abſolutelie, but onlie Conditionallie, and with reſtriction: to wit, if it hath, and in ſo farre onlie as it hath the ſame true Doctrine which is contayned in the holie SCRIPTVRES. And, there-fore, all ſuch Wrytinges, or Sermons, are ſubject to examination, by the SCRIPTVRES. Neyther are wee obliedged to acknowledge them, or anie part of them, as Divine Trueth, but in ſo farre as they propound evidentlie the ſame Doctrine which is delivered in the holie SCRIPTƲRES. And if anie thing in Them bee founde repugnant to holie SCRIPTƲRE, wee ought to reject it, to correct and amende it, as our Progenitoures worthilie profeſſed in their Epiſtle praefixed to their NATIONALL CONFESSION. Neyther can anie humane Ordinance, Act, Oath, Promiſe, or Subſcription, make that to bee the Word of GOD, or the true meaning there-of, which before that Ordinance, Act, Oath, Promiſe, or Subſcription, was not the Word of GOD, nor the true meaning there-of.
               Humane Authoritie, is eyther Private or Publicke. I call Private Authoritie of anie Wryting, or Sermon, that which it hath from the credit, and eſtimation where-in the Author, or conſenter, is had, in reſpect of his Learning, Pietie, Gravitie, Iudgement, Diligence, Experience, &amp;c. ſuch is the Authoritie of the Wrytinges, and Sermons, of fandric Learned men, both Ancient and M
                     •
                  derne. And in this ſort that ſhort CONFESSION
                  
hath reſpectful Authoritie, in reſpect of the Learning &amp; Pietie of the Penner there-of, which was Maſter IOHN CRAIG of happie memorie, Preacher to the King's Majeſtie at that tyme; and in reſpect that manie well-affected Chriſtians did approue it by their Subſcriptions. But by this Authoritie wee are no more tyed vnto this CONFESSION, than wee are to anie part approven by manie good Chriſtians, of the Wrytinges of Ambroſe, or Auguſtine, or Luther, or Calvine, or Beza, or anie other Reverende Divine. Neyther doeth the particular Obligation of thoſe Subſcrybers extende beyond their owne perſons, and lyfe-tymes, expreſſed in that CONFESSION: the example onelie appertayning to others, and imitable by others, ſo farre onelie as the Word of GOD, and the Rules there-in delivered, concerning our Fayth, and Chriſtian libertie, and practiſe, doe direct.
               
                  Publicke Humane Authoritie, is eyther Civill or Eccleſiasticall. And both theſe ſortes in thinges lawfull, that is, not repugnant to Divine Authoritie, are ſo backed, and fortified, by Divine Authoritie, as the contempt of them redoundeth highlie agaynſt Divine Authoritie. And thus theſe Authorities are in ſuch ſorte Humane, as they are alſo, in ſome conſideration, DIVINE.
               Let vs conſider, what ſuch Authoritie this SHORT CONFESSION once had, and what it now hath.
               
                  Supreame Authoritie Civill in SCOTLAND, is eyther Royall or Legall: For altho the publicke Lawes be the King's Royall Lawes, yet becauſe the King may giue Mandates, or Dispenſations, or Commiſsions, which depende onelie vpon his Royall pleaſure, and are not of the nature of fixed Lawes; how-ſo-ever hee ought to bee obeyed alſo in them: There-fore, this diſtinction will not bee vnfitting for our purpoſe. This CONFESSION
                  
had never Authoritie Legall: for it was never ratified by Act of Parliament, as was our NATIONALL CONFESSION, which is regiſtrated in the Actes of Parliament. But all the Civill Authoritie that this SHORT GENERALL CONFESSION had at anie tyme, was onelie Royall, by the King's Mandate, where-of wee ſhall ſpeake more a little after, GOD willing.
               Eccleſiaſticke Authoritie, by two Nationall Synodes, was given to this Confeſsion; and that twofolde: the one immediate, the other mediate.
               
               The Authoritie Synodicall immediate, was that Approbation where-by thoſe Synodes declared this Confeſſion, to bee a true, Chriſtian, Faythfull, and Godlie Confeſsion; and, that ſuch as truelie profeſſe CHRIST, and His true Religion, ought to agree therevnto. This Approbation, beeing in matter of Fayth, &amp; of contrarie Errour, which in Religion is not mutable by anie humane Authoritie, neither depēdeth theron; &amp; the agreement to the ſayde Confeſſion, beeing declared by thoſe Synodes, to bee incumbent vpon ſuch as truelie profeſſe CHRIST, and His true Religion, which is a common deſcription, ſhowing equall obligation vpon all Chriſtians: this Approbation, I ſay, in theſe conſiderations, tending to manifeſt a Divyne Authoritie of the Confeſſion, or Doctrine there-of, doeth in reſpect of the matters ſo approven, equallie obliedge all Chriſtians; neyther doeth it abſolutelie obliedge anie, becauſe ſuch humane wrytings haue not abſolute Divyne Authoritie: yet it hath by that Synodicall Approbation, a reſpectfull Authoritie, ſo farre as wee are obliedged reſpectfullie to reverence the Iudgement of a Nationall Synode of the KIRKE of SCOTLAND, in matters ſubſtantiall. But this reſpect giveth no power to the Synode, to make

true that which is not in it ſelfe true, by authoritie of Holie Scripture; neyther to make that repugnant to GOD'S Word, which before in it ſelfe was not repugnant there-vnto. I ſpeake now of matters ſubſtantiall, aequallie incumbent vpon all Chriſtians. Neyther are wee by this Authoritie obliedged to hearken in matters of this nature to thoſe two Synodes, more than wee are obliedged to hearken to the former or latter Nationall Synodes of the ſame KIRKE, or to anie Nationall Synode of anie forraygne Reformed Kirke, or to anie of the Ancient Councels of Orthodoxe Fathers. All ſuch Obligation is Conditionall, and with Reſtriction, as hath beene before declared. Neyther did thoſe Synodes intende to exeeme this SHORT CONFESSION from lawfull examination, by the Word of GOD, and by the Articles of the Nationall Confeſsion of SCOTLAND, regiſtrated in PARLIAMENT.
               
               The Eccleſiasticall Authoritie mediate, which thoſe Synodes did giue to this SHORT NEGATIVE CONFESSION, was their Ordinance where-by they appoynted and enjoyned all Miniſters, within their juriſdiction at that tyme, to giue obedience to his Majeſties Commandement anent the ſayde CONFESSION, within ſuch a tyme, vnder payne of Deprivation. Nothing is ſpoken in this their Statute, but in relation to the King's Mandate, and for that tyme. There is no mention of Perpetuitie, or tyme to come, or of anie other immediate injunction, for craving this CONFESSION of the people, except that onlie which did immediatelie flow from his Majeſtie: ſo there was never anie Conſtitution Eccleſiaſticall immediate, for exacting or requyring of Subſcription to this CONFESSION, but onelie Mediate by intervention of the King's Mandate: which ſtanding, the matter and

vigour of that Synodicall Conſtitution remayneth: and the Mandate expyring, or beeing taken away, that Synodicall Conſtitution doeth lykewyſe expyre, and ceaſeth to bee of force. Cauſa ſublata, tollitur conſtitutio ex cauſa illa orta. 1. qu. 7. quod pro remedio, in gloſſa. Ceſſante.
               
               But that Mandate is now long agoe expyred, and vtterlie taken away: there-fore, what-ſo-ver Publicke Authoritie, eyther Civill or Eccleſiaſticall, did at anie tyme appertayne to this SHORT GENERALL NEGATIVE CONFESSION, for particular obligation of the Miniſters of SCOTLAND, to exact of their Parochiners, Subſcription to the ſame, or for obliedging the Parochiners to ſubſcrybe there-vnto, is nowe long agoe expyred, and taken away.
               That Royall Mandate, was no perpetuall Law, but a temporarie Mandate, given out in his Majeſties minor age; hee beeing in the fyfteenth yeare of his age then current. There-after hee diſallowed the ſame, in his rype age, as is evident by his Majeſties owne Speach, in the Conference which his Majeſtie had with the Biſſhops, and others of the Clergie of ENGLAND, AT HAMPTON COVRT, Anno 1603, in the ſecond dayes Conference: Where it beeing moved by a certayne Doctor, That this PROPOSITION, [The intenſion of the Miniſter, is not of the eſſence of the Sacrament] might bee added vnto the Booke of Articles, the rather becauſe that ſome in ENGLAND had preached it, to bee eſſentiall; his Majeſtie vtterlie diſlyked that motion; thinking it vnfit to thruſt into the Booke everie Poſition Negatiue; which would both make the Booke ſwell into a volume as big as the BIBLE, and alſo confound the Reader: Bringing for example, the courſe of one Maſter CRAIG, (I am

vſing the wordes publiſhed in the Printed Summe of that Conference) in the lyke caſe in SCOTLAND, who with his, I renounce and abhorre, his deteſtations, and abrenounciations, hee did ſo amaze the ſimple people, that they, not able to conceaue all thoſe thinges, vtterlie gaue over all, falling backe to Poperie, or remayning ſtill in their former ignorance: Yea, if I, ſayd his Majeſtie, ſhould haue beene bound to his forme, the Confeſsion of my Fayth, must haue beene in my Table-booke, not in myne head. Out of theſe his Majeſties wordes, concerning this Negatiue Confeſsion, yee may eaſilie gather his mynde, concerning that Mandate drawne ſome-tyme from his Royall hand, for exacting Subſcription to the ſayde Confeſsion: to wit, that hee did vtterlie diſallow, and annull it: Ad intentionem Mandantis recurrendum eſt. Extra, de reſcriptis, cap. 8. ad aures, in gloſſa. More-over; Although his Majeſtie had not in his lyfe-tyme made voyde that Mandate, as hee did; yet now it were expyred, with His Royall Breath: Morte Mandatoris expirat Mandatum. Extra, de officio &amp; poteſtate judicis delegati, cap. 19. relatum eſt in gloſſa.
               
               Hence it is moſt manifeſt, that this Negatiue Confeſsion hath not, at this preſent tyme, anie publick Authoritie at all: neyther are the Miniſters now obliedged to require, nor the Parochiners to giue Subſcription thereto.
            
            
               
               CHAP. III. Whether it bee convenient for the CHVRCH, at this tyme, that this Negatiue Confeſsion be authorized, and Subſcription there-to requyred.
               
               
                  SAVING better judgement, it ſeemeth not to bee convenient. And that for the Reaſons expreſſed in the CONFERENCE at HAMPTON COVRT. And becauſe of ſome ambiguities, and no ſmall Difficulties there-in.
               It is wyſelie ſayde in our Nationall Confeſsion, in the 18 Article, (noted 19 in the Printed Parliament) that, when Controverſie happeneth, for the right vnderſtanding of anie place, or ſentence of Scripture, or for the reformation of anie abuſe within the Kirke of GOD, wee ought not ſo much to looke what men before vs haue ſayd, or done, as vnto that which the holie Ghoſt vniformlie ſpeaketh, within the bodie of the Scriptures, and vnto that which CHRIST IESUS Himſelfe did, and commanded to bee done.
               And it is alſo to bee conſidered, that where-as wee ought to bee buſie, in inſtructing the ſimple people, in the poſitiue groundes of the Trueth, it ſeemeth verie inexpedient, to bee explayning to them, vnknowne poyntes of Hereſie; which were ſet downe for maſked Papiſtes.
               
               More-over; By the Interpretations which ſome of

our BRETHREN doe giue vs, in their Printed Bookes, they condemne Epiſcopacie, and the fyue PEARTH Articles, as Abominable, and Antichriſtian; and doe affirme, Sitting at the Communion, to be the onlie lawfull geſture. Theſe Doctrines how can wee receaue, without condemning the Doctrine and Practiſe of ſound Antiquitie, and of manie Famous Reformed Kirks, in Britane, France, Germanie, and elſe-where? And were it not a pittifull caſe, that anie of vs beeing in thoſe Countreys, might not communicate with thoſe Reformed Kirkes?
               And howe doeth this Oath and Covenant, about theſe thinges, agree with the xx Article of our Nationall Confeſsion, (noted 21 in the Printed Parliament, Anno 1567) where power is denyed to Generall Councels, to make anie perpetuall Lawe, which GOD before had not made?
            
            
               CHAP. IV. Concerning the keeping or breaking of an Oath; With AN EXHORTATION to CHARITIE and PEACE.
               
                  IN ſo farre as the matter of an OATH is lawfull or vnlawfull, pleaſing or diſpleaſing to GOD, it may, and ought, to bee kept, or broken. When Herod beheaded IOHN THE BAPTIST, for keeping of his Oath, hee

added ſinne to ſinne. But DAVID did well, in ſparing Nabal, and his Familie, whome hee had ſworne to deſtroye: and hee bleſſed GOD, for the good counſell of Abigaill, where-by hee was diverted from performing that Oath.
               
               Let vs not judge hardlie, or vncharitablie, one of another, nor breake the Bond of Peace, and Chriſtian Brotherhood, for the diverſitie of Opinions amongſt vs, in theſe oeconomicall and rituall Controverſies. But whereto we haue alreadie attayned, let vs walke by the ſame rule, let 
                  Phil. 3. 16. 
                  vs mynd the ſame thing; with all lowlineſſe &amp; meekneſſe, with long-ſuffering; forbearing one another in loue; endevouring to keepe the vnitie of the Spirit, in the bond of Peace. 
                  Epheſ. 4. 2. 3.
               
               Now, the ALL-MIGHTIE GOD of Trueth and Peace, illuminate our eyes, and vnite vs all in the knowledge of His Trueth, in the vnitie of Fayth, in the Bond of Loue and Peace, in CHRIST IESUS, our LORD: To Whom bee Glorie for ever:
               AMEN.
            
            
               AVG. EIIT. 5. AD MARCELLINVM.
               Non itaque verum eſt quod dicitur, ſemel rectè factum nullatenus eſſe mutandum. Mutata quippe temporis cauſa, quod rectè ante factum fuerat, ita mutari vera ratio plerumue flagitat; vt cum ipſi dicant, rectè non fieri ſi mutetur, contra veritas clamet, rectè non fieri niſi mutetur. Quia vtrumue tunc erit rectum, ſi erit pro temporum varietate diverſum.
