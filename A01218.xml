            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               ❧Franklins Farewell to the World,
With his Chriſtian Contrition
in Priſon, before his Death.
            FArwell vaine World whoſe comforts all are Cares,
            Whoſe gaines are loſſe, whoſe liberty are Snares:
            Whoſe Gold is Droſſe, whoſe wiſedome is meere folly,
            Whoſe wealth is woe, whoſe ſeruice is vnholly.
            Whoſe Life is Death, whoſe Ioy is Griefe and Sadnes:
            And all that's in thee is a Map of Madnes.
            Who ſo (like me) long in the world hath beene,
            And hath ſo many alterations ſeene,
            How ſome from Greatnes fall, ſome Riſe from little,
            How mans foundation ſlip'ry is and brittle,
            How Tranſitory things doe mount and fall
            At his Great pleaſure, that Created all.
            Who ſo doth note, and beare theſe things in minde;
            Shall ſee how Fortunes breath▪ like wau'ring winde
            Doth blow vp men like bladders with Ambition,
            And caſt them headlong downe to black Perdition.
            That this is true, the world may plainly ſee,
            And view a fearefull ſpectacle in mee:
            For I that had enough of fading pelfe,
            And need not want (except I would my ſelfe)
            I that had Sence, Diſcretion, Reaſon, VVit,
            And could diſcerne things fitting and vnfit,
            I whom my high Creator made a creature,
            Adorning me with guifts of Art, and Nature
            Yet of all this I made no further vſe
            But Gods, Kings, Countryes and my ſoules abuſe.
            From crime to crime ſtill plundging further in,
            With my continuall adding ſinne to ſinne.
            Till ſinne on ſinne, at laſt brought ſhame on ſhame,
            And ſhame on ſhame, paid the deſert of blame.
            My thoughts ſurmis'd th'Almighties eyes were hid,
            And that he ſaw not, what I ſecret did,
            But he (whoſe ſight eclipſeth Moone and Sun)
            Hath brought to light the deeds in darknes done;
            He in his Iuſtice, Iuſtly hath reueal'd
            My hainous faults which I had long conceal'd:
            He hath laid open my notorious crimes,
            To bee a warning to enſuing times;
            That they ſhall neuer dare to doe the like,
            Leaſt (like to me) his vengeance them doe ſtrike.
            Then let a dying friend good counſell giue,
            To all Eſtates and Sexes how they liue:
            Oh let my ending of my loathed breath
            Make all men care, to ſhun eternall death.
            And though my life hath bin polluted foule,
            Yet Iudge with charity my ſinfull ſoule;
            For were the Sinnes of all the world in me,
            Yet (with the eye of Faith) I cleerely ſee
            That Gods great mercy, like a boundles flood
            Through my bleſt Sauiour and Redeemers blood,
            Hath freely pardon'd all that I haue done,
            (By th'interceſſion of his onely Sonne,)
            So that my ſtedfaſt faith doth me perſwade,
            My peace for euer with my God is made.
            Hee that Raiſd Lazarus from out his Graue;
            He that vpon the Croſſe the Theife did ſaue,
            'Tis he alone; and onely none but hee
            Hath raiſd me vp from Death, and ſaued me.
            Yea, though I all my life time haue liu'd euill,
            A ſeruant, and a ſlaue vnto the Deuill:
            Yet heer's the Ioy that makes my courage bolde,
            My Sauiour Chriſt hath tooke me to his folde,
            Hee, true Repentance vnto me hath giu'n,
            And for me (through his merits) purchas'd Heau'n.
            Then World, Fleſh, Sathan, and grim Death auaunt,
            Doe all your worſt, my Faith you cannot daunt:
            He, that for me hath conquer'd Death and Hell,
            Hath granted me that I with him ſhall dwell.
            And though my life Eternall fire did merit,
            Yet God in mercy hath receiu'd my Spirit.
            Farwell my Countrey, by whoſe Iuſtice I,
            For mine vniuſt and bloody action dye.
            Farewell moſt Sacred and Renowned King,
            Whoſe equall Iudgement through the world doth ring:
            Whoſe zeale to Right, and whoſe Impartiall hand,
            Are the maine prop on which this State doth ſtand.
            Long may he Raigne, in his Maieſtick-ſeate,
            And as on Earth, bee made in Heau'n more great.
            Let his Poſterity, and Royall Race
            Be all Inſpir'd with the ſupernall Grace:
            And of his ſeed let vs haue Alwaies one
            To ſway the Scepter of Great Britaines Throne.
            Defend them Lord from ſoule and body harmes,
            From home-bred Traytors, and from Foreigne Armes.
            That in thy fauour they may liue and dye,
            And dye to liue with thee Immortally.
            FINIS.
