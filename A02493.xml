            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

not but lusting evē vpō here say
without looking, is no lesse iustifiable;
yet it pleased our savior

to instance in looking, as well
knowing himselfe, and withall
intending to make vs knowne,
that lusting for the most parte
follows looking. Which the very
heathens well vnderstanding
in the dedication of the several
parts of mans body to their severall
Gods, &amp; Godesses, as the
eares to Minerua, the tongue to
Mercury, the armes to Neptune,
they leaue the eie to Cupid their
God of lust, as being the fittest
for his vse, the proverb holding
alike in inordinate lust, as in ordinary
loue, out of sight, out of
minde. For as the finger ever
waits on griefe; so doth the eie
on loue. Whence in the greeke,
the sāe word only by the chāge
of a vowell signifieth both to

and by consequence bold; yet I
finde the way chaulked out vnto
it by Gregory Nissene in his exposition
vpon the Lords praier,
in the article of lead vs not into
temptation. For the first then of
these particulars, Salomon giues
an excellent precept, Looke not

                     nd wherso▪
                  
                  Eccl. 31. 13
                  ever thine eie looketh, &amp; thrust it
not with it into the dish, as giving
therby to vnderstād, that intēperat
powring down strong drink
and inordinate devouring delicious
meats, ariseth oftner from
the greedinesse and vncontent
of the eie, then from any reall
want, or desire of the appetite.
For the second, the same Salomō
                  
in an other place maketh it as

cleare as the former.Eccles. 4. v. 8. 
                  There is on

alone (saith he) and there is not a
second, which hath neither sonne
nor brother, yet is there no ende
of all his travell, nor can his eie be
satisfied with riches, noting the
chiefe cause of the restlesse discontent
of the mind, and needelesse
spending of the bodie to
arise from the insatiablenesse of
the eie.Eccl
                        •
                     s. 1. v. 8. 
                  The eare being neuer filled
with hearing, nor the eie satisfied
with seeing. For a covetous mans
eie hath never enough of a portion,
and his wicked mallice vvithereth
his owne soule, which
the divell well vnderstanding in
his last, and hottest assault vpon
our Savior, tempted him by the
eie, in shewing him all the kingdomes
of the world,
                  Mat. 4. 8. 
                  &amp; the glory of
them. Which word no doubt is
expresly added to signifie the
chiefe bait, by which the tempter
had well hoped to haue

caught our Saviour.

farther opening of them, onely
contenting my selfe to haue

                  nd mothinkes
for this present purpose, tis
worth the considering that they
which helde the sunne for their
God, adored him not at noone
day, walking then as a gyant in
his ful strength, not to be gazed
on; but either at rising or

                  alling
because then hee appeares most
glorious to the eie; &amp; the greatest
part at rising; because his
glory after the darknes is most
acceptable to the sight, it being
therfore compared by the Psalmist,
in rising, to a bridegroome
comming forth of his chamber,
who in passing by draws everie
mās eies after him. For this cause
doeth God by his Prophet callEsa. 20. 78
the Idols of Egypt the abomination
of the eies, twice within the
compasse of 2. verse, and in the

15. of Numbers,Ver. 39. 
                  you shal not seek
after your own hart, nor after your
own eies, after which you go a who
ring,
                  4. 15. but that of Exodus is in my
iudgement yet much fitter for
this presēt discourse. Take therfore
good heed vnto your selus, for
you saw no image in the daie that
the Lord spake vnto you in Horeb
out of the midst of the fire, that yee
corrupt not your selues &amp; make a
graven image, or representatiō of
figure, and least thou lift vp thine
eies to heaven, and whē thou seest
the sunne, and the moone, and the
stars, with all the hoast of heaven,
shoulst be driven to worship them.
Which wordes in the weakest
apprehension, at first view, cannot
but inforce a very powerfull,
and actiue operation of the
eie, in drawing the minde from
the contemplation of the fayrest
visible creatures, to the fow
lest of all sins, if it finde not the

grace of God, and the sense of
true religion planted in it. I will
conclude this point with that
notable speech of Iob;
                  31. 26. where amongst
the rest of his imprecations
vpō himselfe, he inserteth
if I did behold the sun whē it shined,
or the moone walking in her
brightnes, this had beene iniquity
to be condemned, for I had denyed
the God aboue, which words the
common streame of interpreters
vnderstand to bee meant of
the daunger of falling into this
spirituall fornication, &amp; sinning
against the Creator, by too
much doting vpon, &amp; admiring
the beauty of those glorious creatures.

little, and to lose, which by that
meanes might easily either bee
broken, or cast of. But in this
point, me thinks tis worthy speciall
consideration, that nature
hauing so framed the eie, as it
can neither behold it selfe, nor
the face, in which it is set, yet
haue men invented for the supplying
of that vse looking-glasses,
as the artificial eies of pride;
the eie being as it were a liuing
looking-glasse, &amp; the looking-glas
again a dead eie, by means
wherof many Narcissus like become
enamored of themselues,
by to to much admiring their

this Vniversity, who being newly
recovered from the smal pox,
&amp; by chance seeing the change
of his face in a looking-glasse,
for meere griefe fell into a relapse,
and within short time died.
And sure I am perswaded,
that the vse of it in the art of seeing,
is not of such consequence
as it can in any sort countervail
the damage arising frō it, in the
art of manners, nether are there
by it so many staines and blemishes
discovered in the face,
as imprinted in the soule.

with one consent, set al vpō the

               THE seaventh and last particular
in this kinde which I
will speake of, is bewitching by
the eie, to which the Apostle S.
Paul alludes in his Epistle to the
Galathians, where he demands
[who had bewitched them?]

but this once onely in the new

Testament, &amp; (as I thinke) in the
Canonicall scripture, &amp; (as the
learned Beza hath rightly observed)
properlie signifieth a
kinde of fascination, or bewitching
by the eie, and therefore
the Apostle in the same verse,
continuing his metaphor, opposeth

or privie counsailour of nature
as also his followers in their
problems,Alex. lib. 2. prob. 54. or questions, of the
secrets of nature, haue inserted
among the rest, one of this

kinde of bewitching; not as
doubting of the trueth of the
thing, but as searching onlie
into the manner of it, and remedie
against it; but the best
that I haue met with, for discovering
this mystery, is Plutarch
in the fift booke of table-talke,
where hee witnesseth,Prob. 7. that
whole families, &amp; nations haue
beene tainted with that disease;
&amp; Plinie giues the reason of placing
Satyres, and Antikes to
be looked on, in the entries and
portales of great mens houses,
to haue beene the possessing by
that meanes, of the thoughts of
that malicious kinde of people,
by which their strength in hurting
might either bee diverted,
or abated. Some write that womē
that haue a double pupill in
their eie, doe most harme this
way; but vpon what certaine
grounds of experience, I cannot

affirme; only in this, I finde most
of auncient heathen Philosophers
to concur, &amp; some of the
latter christian Physitions, that
not only men and women,Vlmus de occultis remediis c▪ 10 doe
interchangeably hurt one an other
in this kinde (as hath already
beene shewed,) but both
of thē vnreasonable creatures,
and they againe, both men, and
women. For the first of which
sort,Plin. li. 30. cap. 11. it is in my iudgment worth
the observing, which many natural
historiographers, (&amp; these
of the chiefest ranke) report, &amp;
Plutarch addes, that himselfe
hath tryed, that a man beeing
sicke of the yelow-iandise, if he
stedfastly looke vpon the eie of
the bird Icterus▪
                   or Galgalus, him
selfe may perhaps recover, but
the bird dies instantly, without
faile; And on the other side it is
as cōmonly receaved not onely
among the vulgar, but the learned;

that the Basilike by his eie
killeth a man:Picolom. Zabarel in lib. de visu. which the 2 greatest
naturalists of this age▪ take
as granted, when as having set
downe their state, that the act
of seeing ariseth from somwhat
receaved into the eie, they obiect
this experience against it,
and answere it rather by vvai
                     •
                  
of exposition, then denial, granting
indeed that he hurts a man
by his eie, but rather by some
pestilēt vapor, which proceedes
frō it, thē by any ray, or beame,
which helps it in seeing, which
resolution of theirs, as it salveth
their former assertion, so doth it
plainly make for our present discourse,
of poysoning by the eie▪
I here passe over the fresh bleeding
of a dead corps, at the looking
on of the murtherer, as also
Medusaes turning men into

doubtlesse, stretcheth farther
then the ordinary reader at first
blush cōceaveth; in shadowing
vnder that fable, the suddaine astonishment
of men, at the raies

NOw for the generall rebelliō

                  Mat. 6. 23. &amp;
in the chapter going before, hee

                   the counsailour to the heart,

whence S. Iohn fitly comparing
all worldly vanities to a three
headed Cerberus, or 3. shapte
Chimera, placeth the lust of the
eies▪ betweene the lust of the
worlde, and the pride of life;
to which middle head (in my
iudgmēt) may fitly be reduced,
that excessiue delight, which
we naturally take, in beholding
one beast cruelly to wo

being by his advise, once withdrawne
from them, and by company
drawne thither againe; hee
told thē, that they might force
his body thither, but his eies,
they should not, which protestation
hee indeed made good;
vntill at lēgth, a grievous woūd
being givē by one of the Combaters,

a great shout was sudd

raised, through the theater; at
which (Alipius not able any longer
to forbeare) opened his eies
and seeing the bloud trickling
downe, dranke in cruelty with
the sight, receaving a greater
wound in his soule, then the cō
                  bater
did in his heade, neither
was he now the man that came
thither, but one of the manie▪
vnto whom he came; and a true
companion, or rather captaine,
of those who drewe him thither
by force. Hither also may be referred,
the lewd masking, which
the Papistes vse in their Carnivals,
or rather Bacchanals, at
Shrouetide; the women marching
through the open streetes,
in mans apparrell, and the men
in womens; as also the Iesuits
exhibiting of heaven and hell,
God &amp; the divell, the damned,
and the elect, vpon their stages:

to which may be added, the beholding
of vaine &amp; wanton pictures,
such as Aretines, ordinary
among the Italians, &amp; west
Indians. But for their dangerous
effect, I refer the reader to
that example,Lib. 2. c. 17 Ex Ter. which S. Augustine
alleadgeth in his booke of
the citty of God, Of a certaine
young man, who looking vpō a
painted table, in which was described
Iupiters descending in a
goldē shower, into Danaes lap,
takes hold of the next opportunitie,
of running into the same
kinde of sensualitie, and defends
his fact, by the Example
of Iupiter the great Monarch
and governour of the
world. Lastly, here might challenge
its due place, that lascivious
grosse action, which is ever
represented, in the French Comedies
and daunces▪ and sometimes
in our common Mercenarie

interludes here at home,
whe
                     •
                   at the greatest part, would
surely otherwise rather blush,
then laugh; but that they holde
that place in a manner priviledged:

sacrament are performed? Whiles
thou accustomest thy selfe to see
such spectacles, insensibly, &amp; by degrees,
bidding adue to shame &amp; modesty,
thou beginnest to entertaine

&amp; practise the same. Those verie
women, whom their own lewdnes,
&amp; vnhappines, hath prostituted to
the cōmō vse, are notwithstāding
covered with the darke, &amp; secret

haue sould their blushing, yet in
such actions blush to be seene. But
this Monster enters the▪ theater,
dares moūt the stage, &amp; doth take
a pride, to play his part, in the publike
view &amp; face of the world; and
not only to speak &amp; do naught, but
to glory &amp; boast in it, &amp; which is
worse to professe himself a Master

of this boldnesse, the brasen
forehead of the stewes, may iustly
challenge the title of Modestie.

examples in the chiefest. First

                     us or
Proteus like) to turne himselfe
into any shape, or (Chameleon
like) into any colour: nay which
is more, wheras the Chamaeleon
cannot chaunge himselfe into
white; yet can the Divell transforme
himselfe into an Angell
of light: and not only himselfe,
but other things in such sorte,
that sometimes hee makes them
seeme to bee present when they
are not, and sometimes not to
seeme when they are, and at other
times againe, to appeare in
another shape and fashion than
they are indeed, &amp; in their owne
nature. In al which kinds I finde
among the Dutch writers plentiful
&amp; rare examples,De spectris Von Zau.

are not; the former of them
brings this story.Lau. part▪ 1. de de spect

                  Henry the second
Emperour of that name,
vchemently suspecting Chunegund
his empresse, for vsing false
play with a Courtier too familiar
with her, his iealousie was (as
he thought) iustly increased, for
that the Courtier was often seen
to come forth of her chamber,
early in the morning▪ and alone;
but the good Empresse, beeing
put to her purgation by the Ordalian
lawe for the clearing of
this vniust surmise, walked over
fire hot culters, with naked
feet, vnhurt, which discovered
to the world, as wel her innocē
                  cie,
as the divels policy, in counterfaiting

such a shape and vsing
it in such sort, as might most incense
the Emperour, and drawe
the Empresse, with others, into
vndeserved suspition. The same
authour, in the same booke, relateth
that himselfe had heard
of a wise, and graue man, one of
the chiefe governours of the Tigurin
Canton; that himselfe, and
his servant, travailing in a sommers
morning, through the medowes,
hee saw (as him seemed)
one of his neighbours committing
bestiality with a Mare, but
knowing the good honest report
of the man, and thereby
misdoubting his owne eies, hee
gets him p
                     •
                  esently to his house;
where hee finds him good man,
in his bed, fast a sleepe. Wherein
we may see, as in the one, the
divels businesse, in abusing the
weaknes of this sense, so in the
other Gods providence in clearing

the innocent. I vrge these
examples to this ende, that if
these men had trusted there
owne sight, and not made farther
search they had surely incurred
what the divell by those

                     •
                  leights hunteth after, the offending
of God, and the endangering
there own souls in the shedding
of innocent bloud. If I
might without tediousnesse, I
would adde one history more,
of the divels cūning in making
things appeare which indeede
are not, which tooke effect according
to his designe. (I confesse
I vrge it not so much for
the fitnesse, as the strangenes of
the story.) It fell out in the yeare
1282. in a towne named Hammel,
vnder the Duke of Brunswikes
dominion, an od mate cō
                  ming
thither vnder the habit of
a Rat-catcher, and having done
good service to the towne, for

which hee was but poorely rewarded;

                  es, a number of the children
of the towne, flocking after
him, followed him so far, till
at length comming without the
gates, he led them al into a little
hillocke, where they all vanished
togither, &amp; were never seene
after to the nūber of 130. The
relation I knowe cannot but
seeme very strange, and therfore
will hardly paste for credible,

act is at this day to be seene registred

church, and besides that the
streete through which they passed,
beares his name of the accident,
and their ancient publicke
instruments of law, as bands, &amp;
leases beare date, as well frō the
yeare of the departure of there
children, as from the incarnation
of Christ; which inducemēts
me thinkes, are able to make a
man swallow a greater difficultie.
               Nowe for the divels seconde
practise, in deceiving the sight,
by making things not appeare
which indeede are present, I
finde a memorable example,
which hapned not long since,Whitikin. dus cap. 6.

ven this is nothing else but a
delusion of the sight either by
fitting the skinns of such beasts
to the bodies of men and women,
who by a deepe strong imagination,
or naturall disease,
suppose themselues to be such
indeed, as they seeme to bee; or
by applying to them aiery bodies;
which sometimes to bee so
is manifest in that being torne
with the teeth of dogs, or strikē
with staues, their former shape
soone vanisheth, but the print
of the blowe remaineth. To

we haue aboue proued. The patrons

which seeme to bee the inseparable
companions of a reall
change, as swift running, devouring
of children, vndergoing of
great burdens, and the like; I

hold some of them to haue bin
performed by the divell himself
in a seeming phantastick body;
others in the bodies of beastes,
possessed by himselfe; and lastly
not a few, by beasts themselues▪

place of such; as witches suppose
they haue transformed all

none of them by any reall or
true change: it being no more
possible▪ for the reasonable soul
of a man to dwell in the bodie
of a beast, then for the vnreasonable
soule of a beast to dwell
in a mans body; which if we

vpon the same ground, aswell a

of soules, from beasts to men, &amp;
from men to beasts againe.

part of those Ghosts, faires,
pixes, hobgoblings, that haue
beene seene to walke in former

people; partly to get money to

to begge somewhat for the

to their order in shewing the
vertue of their exorcismes vpon
them: The like may bee saied
of the sweating, and weeping
of their images, of the rowling

of their eies, &amp; nodding of the
heads. It is worth the remembring
which Erasmus recounts
to this purpose, of a Priest▪ who

The report being cast abroad,
was entertained with a feareful
kinde of reverence of the most,
and the wisest were content to
bee hudwinckt for cōpany. The
next sunday comes the Priest,
to play his part, and out of the
pulpit tells them very seriously
that these walking spirits were
the soules of their dead friends,
who being sore tormented in
purgatory begged to be loosed
from those paines, by masses &amp;

almes; this perswasiō went currant,
vntill at length by the
negligence, or forgetfulnesse
of the Priest, two or three of the
crabbes were founde in the day
time among the rubbish, with▪
the candles sticking to their
sides, by which meanes the
knavery was detected and the
Priest punished. To these may
be added those▪ comicall impostures
for the casting out of devils
practised by Priests, and Iesuits,
in which the principal part
is prooued to bee nothing else

bee added two other famous oversights

rather incurred, then imposed;
The former by Charles Duke of

of Paris; and having certaine intelligence
of the kings drawing

THESE later examples may
not vnfitly bee reduced to
the delusion of the sighte,
wrought by the ignoraunce of
natural causes; but among al artificiall
deceiving of the eie,
(wherof I intended in this place
chiefly to speake) that of painting,
and limming is the most
noble; by which not only vnreasonable
creatures, as birds
by flying at painted grapes haue
beene deceived; but men also,
nay (which is more) a painter
himselfe; bidding his Corrival
(if he feared not shame) by his
worke, to draw his curtaine, &amp;
present his table to the publike
censure; vvhereas the curtaine
was indeed but counterfeit; and
by that meanes was the price
adiudged the latter, for that the
one had deceived birds onelie,
the other men. For so it is that
this sense which I finde not in

any of the rest, is so bewitched
that its then most delighted,
when tis most deceived, by shadowings,
and landskips, and in
mistaking coūterfaits for truths
            
            
               CAP. 19.
               That the eies serue not only as
treacherous porters, and false reporters
in naturall and artificiall
things, but also as secret intelligencers,

of the minde and diseases of
the body.
               NEIther doe our eies onely
serue as false reporters to
the minde, in natural and artificiall
things, but as secret intelligencers,
in morall matters, for
discovering her weakenesse to
the world. Thus by a fierce sparkling
eie, we discover anger; by
an open staring eie, vnstaidnes:

by a rowling vnsetled eie wantonnesse;
by a hollow wan eie,
envy▪ and iealousie; by a hautie
skornfull eie pride; by a narrow
deiected eie, basenesse; by a dull
fixed eie, heavines of spirit; many
times to the shame, &amp; sometimes
to the disadvātage of him
that is discovred; his enemies by
this means gaining advātage to
work vpō that passiō, by which
they see him Possessed, or to
which they iudge him most inclined:Prov. 17. 24.
to this agrees that of Salomon,

humors, the 7 tunicles, the muscles,
the vaines, the arteries, the
nerues, the spirits, &amp; withal vnderstand
that each of these hath
his severall diseases proper to it,
besides those which are many
times imparted from the distē
                  per
of the braine (with which
the eie holdes a marvelous correspondence)
and those which
are incident to the whole bal of

the eie as excesse, or defect in
quantitie, improper situation,
or figuration, or the like, cannot
but conceaue as much as is before
affirmed, especially if to
these internall diseases we ioine
those externall accidents, offē
                  siue
to it, winde, dust, smoake,
gnats, straines, stripes, bruises,
sometime to the diminution,
and sometime to the depravation,
and not seldome to the totall
losse and perishing of the
sight. But aboue all it is most cō
                  siderable
that light the very obiect
in which it most delighteth,
and comforteth it selfe, it
notwithstanding most hurtfull,
and dangerous to it by dispersing
and dissolving (as it were)
the opticke spirits; as may appeare
by S. Paul stricken blind,
with a light from heavē, which
suddenly shoane round about
him: and by Zenophons souldiers

who travelling many daies,
through the snow, the greatest
part of them lost their sight; To
this ende, tis worth the remembring,
which Galen mentioneth
in his tract of the sight,Lib. 10 de vsu partii
                        •
                     . Cap. 3. that Dionysius
the tyrāt of Sicilie being
disposed to punish any with
blindnesse, would first cast them
into a deepe dungeon in which
was no crevise, or chincke for
admission of the sunne beames,
where hauing kept them by the
space of certaine daies, they
were in a cleere sunshine weather,
immediatly from thence
brought into a higher chamber
full of lights, and all pa
                     •
                  ieted
over with a bright kind of plaister;
by which meanes surfiting
(as it were) and glutting their
eies vpon this new fresh lustre,
within a while 
                     •
                  according to the
tyrants designe) they became
flarke blinde. The truth of this

assertion is also prooued by the
experience of seeing the starres
at noone day, from the bottom
of a deep well, or when the sun
is eclipsed (as Thucydides witnesseth
it happened in his time)
the sight being otherwise so dazeled
with the cleerenes of the
sun-beames, that it cannot possibly
apprehend or discern those
lesser lights in presence of the
greater. But beside these assaults
of the sight from without, and
diseases arising from the natural
dispositiō from withint; diverse
kindes of meates, and sauces
there are, in our ordinary diet,
which serue as much to diminish
or depraue the sight, as
to nourish or augment the body.
Of these D. Baily in his treatise
of the preservation of the eie
sight, hath mustred vp a faire
troupe; which mixed withsome
other accidents, the schoole of

                  Salerne hath notwithstandinge

since as well in the works of art
as nature, that which hath greatest
force in actuating, &amp; quickning
the thing wee see (as the
soule in the body) is notwithstāding
it selfe for the most not
seene; the statelinesse of houses,
the goodlines of trees, when we
behold thē, delighteth the eie;
but the foundation which beareth
vp the one, and the roote
which to the other ministreth
sap and iuice, is in the bosome
of the earth concealed. And
generally the sight is not capable,
but of corporal, accidental,
particular things; and in them
only of their crust, and surface,
and that only in direct obiects,
and by helpe of the light: wheras
the hearing apprehends all
manner of sounds, from all difference
                     •
                  
of places, as well from

behinde as from before, &amp; that
at all times as well in the darke,
as in the day, and that which
chiefly makes for the increase of
knowledge, vniversalls, immaterials,
and the inward parts of
things. Therefore Socrates as for
other things, so for this among
the rest was adiudged by the oracle
the wisest living; that casting
his eies vpon a faire but silent
face, he bid him speak, that
hee might see him: as if hee had
said in other tearmes that the
sense of hearing, makes more to
the vnderstanding of the true
nature of things, then that of
seeing; and in this case one care
witnesse is of more value then
ten eie-witnesses. Thus doe we
iudge by the hearing onely of
the temper of mettals, the soūdnesse
of timber, the emptinesse
of vessels, the deepnesse of waters;
&amp; ordinarily, in the course

of life
                     •

well remember, at the last commencement

often pervert the course of iustice,
as may appeare in the story
of Susanna, and by that worthy
speech of Pericles to Sophocles,

the masters of al cōditions whō

finde none comparable to his

out of his knaveries; but yet
more fully in our night meditations,
which by reason of the restraint
of our sight spring from
our most retired thoughts; and
by that meanes for the most
part savour as much of iudgement,

and ripenesse, as those of

the sonnes of men; and (which
is worth the observing) whiles

                  ee in the

Paralell with these figure-flinggers
may not vnfitly be matched
those fortune-tellers, who

a professour of these artes, who
looking stedfastly on him, and
out of the groūds of his profession
pronouncing him to be vitiously

that indeed he said somewhat, if

the disposition of his inbred

haue of our seeing though
rightly guided in the furtherance

beholding the outward circumstances
of the sacraments, the
want of which may also sufficiently
bee recompenced by the
other senses of feeling &amp; smelling,
but especially hearing and
tasting; whence it is that men
borne deafe are excluded from
this sacrament by the common
cōsent of divines but not blind;
howbeit Danaeus in his book of
the sacraments affirmes that M.

of certaine signes which he

his faith; but how hee shoulde
come to the knowledge, which
might guid him to the making
of such signes, or how the minister
by them might apprehend
his conceits, neither doth Daneus expresse, nor (to speake a
truch) can I imagine. First then
for faith which S. Paule defines
to bee the evidence of things not

sight, wee find it to bee bred by
hearing onely as the ordinarie
meanes, and nourished by the
same alone, as by the ordinance
of God, that only caseof the sacraments
excepted; and therefore
it is not said that a colour
or a shape tooke flesh, but the
word that was incarnate, that
was God, 2. for hope, Paul in an

other place speaketh thus,Rom. 8. 24. 
                  hope
that is seen is not hope: for how cā

but if wee hope for that which wee
see not, with patience wee abide

which are seen,

                  but on the things
which are not seen; for the things
which are seene are temporal, but
the things which are not seene are
eternall. Lastly,

                   (making thē
reciprocal,) who desired to see
the day of our Saviour, and saw
it not, I answer that their desire
concerned not so much the beholding
of him face to face, as a

distinct &amp; particular knowledg
of the Messias and the vertue of
his incarnation and passion: in
which sense Abraham is said to
haue reioiced to haue seene his
day, and he saw it, &amp; was glad,
and the Apostles eies are pronou
̄ced blessed for seeing those
things which they saw.

the light of the Gospell is fully

faithfull steward in the house of
God, and the other, the doctor of
the gentiles, in nothing inferior to

the chiefest of the Apostles; neither
of them, notwithstanding
having ever seene our Saviour

Simeō,
                  Luk. 2. 30. 
                  now lettest thou thy seruāt
depart in peace, because mine eies
haue seen thy salvatiō, I am surely
of opinion that his peace cō
                  sisted
not so much in this, that
hee had seene our Saviour with
his carnall eies, and imbraced
him with the arme of flesh, as
that hee saw him by the eie of
faith, and imbraced him in the
armes of spirituall affection; as
tis truely said of the blessed Virgin,
that her blessednesse consisted
not so much in bearing our
Saviour in her wombe, as in her
heart: and for that speech of S.
Augustine (if it be his) where he
is said to haue desired to haue
seene three things, Rome in her
flower, Paul in the pulpit, and
Christ in the flesh; I may iustly

suppose his meaning to haue
beene rather in living in those
times of the purity of the church
for the fuller clearing of some
controversies then afoot in his
time, then out of any curiositie
of seeing the person of our Saviour.

.
               OVR adversaries indeede,
place a greate and maine
part of their superstitious worship
in the eie-service; in the
magnifike &amp; pompous fabrick,
and furniture of their Churches
and attiring their Priests; in gazing
vpon their dumb ceremonies,
which with very multitude
as leaues cover the fruits,
in beholding the daily elevatiō
                  
of their Idoll in the masse, (for
the greatest part hear nothing)
&amp; lastly in fixing their eies vpō
pictures, and images; giuing
them the Titles of remembrances
for the learned, &amp; books for
the laity. And surely I am perswaded
that it may very cleerely
bee shewed out of the historie
of the Church, that images
never came to bee of that vse, &amp;
in that request which now they
are, before the preaching of the
Gospell grew so cold; that the
Idoll Priests not able to suffice
their auditorie in hearing; were
forced to set vp, and the people
content to receaue those Idols,
for the satisfying of their minds
by seeing. But S. Paul was of an
other iudgem
                     •
                  nt in this case, as
we may see in the third chapter
of his Epistle to the Galathians,
where hee affirmeth that Christ
was described (the originall

word is painted forth) before
their eies,VI. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . and among them crucified,
which was not (as some
Priests haue sottishly vrged in
mine hearing) anie corporall
crucifix or picture vpō a woodden
table or glass-window with
materiall colours, but a liuelie
demonstration in the evidence
of the spirit; as may be gathered
by the words themselues, besides
the drift of the place: and
besides all this they haue framed
to themselues, insteed of an
invisible head in heaven, a visible
head here on earth, as if the
not seeing of a thing tooke away
the not being or working
of it; and those glorious titles
which are given either to the
invisible triumphant Church aboue,
or the militant truly consisting
of the elect heere below,
they for the most part attribute
to a visible congregation of the

Pope, and his Cardinals in their
consistory, or to the assembly of
an oecum

               That the sight of the creature
helpeth vs little in the knowledge
of God.
               LAstly for the sight of the creatures
&amp; frame of the visible
world, as S. Paul sheweth in the
first to the Romans, it shal rather
serue for the inexcusablenesse
&amp; condemnation of those that
bel
                     •
                  eue not, thē for the furtherance
of the salvation of them
that beleeue: neither, (to speake
a trueth) is the sight of the creature
so much availeable to the
knowledge of the creator, as the
vnderstanding of its depending
from him, and working by him,
which notwithstāding is rather

gotten by hearing then by seeing
: &amp; to grant all that may bee
reasonably required in this case
yet stil on the other side must it
necessaryly bee yeelded vnto,
that in al the articles of Christian
religion (howbeit some of
thē may be prooved by conclusions
drawn from the sight) the
words of our Savior to Thomas
ought to prevaìle with all true
harted christians, blessed are they
that haue not seene, &amp; haue beleeved, it being then most acceptable
to God, to yeeld our cōsent
in beleeving, when the experience
of sense, and the reach of
reason most faile vs, and vvhen
they serue vs best not to assent
so much for their sakes, of which
we haue vse only as men, as for
our faiths sake alone which properly
belongeth to vs as christians
. There are (
                     •
                  aith S. Augustin)
in the beginning of his book of the

faith of invisible things, wh
                        •
                      think
Christiā religiō rather to be scorxed,
thē to be held, because in it nothing
is demonstrated which may
be seene, but the faith of thinges
which are not seene is cōmanded:
but for vs, we know that we ought
to beleeue many temporall things,
which wee see not, that hereafter
we may be coūted worthy to be admitted
to the sight of eternall
things vvhich wee nowe beleeue:
whence it is that men vtterly
void of the sense of seeing, bring
with them mindes for the most
part better prepar'd to religious
exercises, then the commō sort,
remember more, and practise it
better.
            
            
               CAP. 27.
               That the eie of the sense failing,
that of the vnderstanding &amp; spirit
waxe more cleare.
               SO ordained it is, in a manner

by God, and nature; that as
vvhen one eie is deprived of
sight, the other sees better then
it did before; or as Iohn Baptist
decreasing Christ increased; and
as the house of David waxed
stronger &amp; stronger, the house
of Saule waxed weaker &amp; weaker
; so when the eie of the outward
sense, growes dull, &amp; dim,
the intellectuall eie of reason,
and the spirituall eie of faith,
grow more fresh, and cleare; betweene
which three I finde the
like proportion, as between the
life of man in his mothers wōb,
the world, and the kingdome of
heaven. Thus wee see Paules
blindnes in the eies of his sense,
and the opening of the eies of
his vnderstanding, to haue happened
in a manner at the same
instant: and in the Ecclesiastical
story,R

that the mortal light of their bodyly
eie beein extinguished,
they had gaine

                   fruition
of heavenly and immortall
brightnes. And in the gospell
we read not of any on whome
our Saviour wrought so many
miracles, as vpon the blinde, in
restoring their sight, which must
needes argue in thē an extraordinary
strength of faith, the vertue
and effect of his vvorking
being ever proportioned to the
beleefe of those on whom hee
wrought. To which we may
from thence be the more casilie
induced to grant assent, for that
amonge all those blinde men
which the scripture names and
commends to our consideratiō
we finde none of them branded
with any notorious vice: but on
the contrarie, many of them
of excellent vertue, renowned
in their ages, and commended

to posterity: as Eli and Sampson
both types of Christ; Abiiah
though blind yet counted worthy
to be one of Gods seers; Isaac
and Iacob both chiefe patri
arches and pillars of Gods chosen
people; of whom the one
though he knew not his sonnes
when hee blessed them, yet in
the manner of blessing hee deserved
to knowe them; by his
blindnesse beeing occasioned,
the effecting of Gods purpose,
in the preferring of Iacob, before
Esau; and the other,Gen. 27. having laid
his hands athwart,Gen. 48. vpon his two
Nephews Manasses &amp; Ephraim
would not remoue them according
to the advise and desire of
their Father Ioseph; but fixed thē
according to the guidaunce of
that light which directed him
from within, and whē he could
hardly see vvith the eies of his
body his sons which stoode before

him, yet with the eies of his
minde did hee foresee and foretel
what should become of each
of them and their issue for many
generations ensuing.

               Treating of the drvers priviledges
of blind men.
               
                  
OVr Saviour himselfe giues
testimony of him that was
borne blind, that neither his, nor
his parents sin was the cause of it,
but that the workes of God might
be made manifest,
                  Iob. 9. 30 which testimony I find not given to any other
infirmity of the sense or disease
of the body. But yet more observable
seemeth the last verse
of the same chapter, where our
Saviour not only excuseth blindnesse,
as not proceeding from
sinne, but maketh it in a manner
the cause of not sinning (if you
had beene blind (saith he) you had
not sinned) both which passages
I confesse to be subiect to interpretation,
and for their ful clearing
to need many distinctions;
yet for my purpose is the letter
alone sufficient, in which no
doubt but vnder the very rinde
of it (as in the whole scripture
beside) the speaker being the engraven

forme of the godhead, and
the eternal wisdome of his father,
intēded some special thing, besides
the general drift, &amp; scope
of the place. His meaning in
these words may somewhat the
better appeare, if wee compare
them with them in the gospell,
where speaking by way of parable
of the great supper provided
in the kingdome of heaven,Luk. 14. 21
when the bidden guests refused
to come, he expresly by name
commaunded the blinde to bee
brought in, and placed at the table
; and in a verse or two immediately
going before, to make
knowne his care and respect even
towarde those who are indeed
bodily blind, he exhorteth
his disciples and followers, that
when they make a feast, one of
their chiefe cares should bee to
invite the blinde, as their principall
guests; besides reason and

law exempteth them from personall
serving in the wars. And
in the Levitical law of the Iews
we finde an heavy curse, to be
laid on such as should lay a stū
                  bling
blocke before the feete of
the blind,Lev. 19. 14 or turn him out of his
right way: and the ancient Romanes
imposed on some of their
chiefe families the surnames of
blind &amp; lame to this end (saith
Plutarch) that the people should
not skorne at those imperfections,
In vita Coriol. and by that meanes condemne
or neglect those excellent
gifts of the minde vvhich
many times reside in such bodies
. Hence Iob when he would
make his innocēcy cleare to the
world, knew not how to expres
it more effectually, or in better
tearmes; thē by professing himselfe
to haue beene an eie to the
blind. And Lewes the 8. of that
name who was the only Saint,

whole three races of the fren

kings; how beit he wonne many
glorious conquests against the
infidels, &amp; erected many goodly
buildings for religious persons,
yet was hee thought worthy
that honour for nothing
more, then for instituting the
colledge of the 300. blind men,
vpon occasion of so many of his
souldiers, who were taken in his

is proued by the strong impression

by consequent the mother of
vnion and loue; the repose and

entrance &amp; overturne to therenewing
of travaile: our daiely
cares in this case being likened
to the marygold or dazy which
openeth with the rising of the
sun, and shuts with the setting.
And where as the Poet witneseth
of the Carthaginian Queene
that her care had alwaies recourse

towards the evening; I
suppose it not so much to bee
meant of a sober &amp; setled, as of
a distracted, and distempered
minde; such as he supposes hers
to haue beene; if then the night
bring not tediousnesse with it,
why should a day which is like
a night be thought to bring it?
Though I denie not but to the
pleasures of the night may also
be added those which we vse as
cōmonly in the day; in hearing
of bookes read, in playing vpon
musical instruments, in discoursing
with friends, in exercising
many pastimes, which require
not the vse of seeing. Nay in
those very sports which seeme
necessarily to require it, as bouling,
shooting, coiting, shoufgrating,

                   dissembling knaue discovered
by Duke Humphry for
whom no doubt it had beene
better to haue bin indeed blind
then to haue pretended the recovery

of his sight by such a no
torious cousenage; the storie is
recorded word forword, by Fox
as followeth. In the yong daies
of Henry the 6. being yet vnder
the governance of Duke Humphry
his Protectour, there came
to S. Albones a certaine Beggar
with his Wife,Act and Mō p. 
                        •
                     705 Col. 1. Edit. 1583. &amp; there was wal
king about the Town, begging
5. or 6. daies before the Kings
comming thither, saying that he
was borne blind &amp; never saw in
his life, and was warned in his
dreame, that hee shoulde come
out of Barwike, where hee said
he had ever dwelled to seeke S.
Albon, and that he had beene at
his Shrine, &amp; had not been holpen,
&amp; therefore he would go &amp;
seeke him at some other place:
for he had heard some say, since
he came, that S. Albones Bodie
should be at Colē, &amp; indeed such
a contention hath there beene.

But of truth as I am surely in formed,
hee lieth at S. Albenes, saving
some Reliks of him, which
they there shew shreyned. But
to tell you forth, when the King
was commen, &amp; the towne full,
suddainly this blind mā at S. Albones
shryne had his sight again

Te Deum song, so that nothing
was talked of in all the towne,
but the miracle. So hapened it
then, that Duke Humfry of Glocester,
a man no lesse wise, then
also well learned, hauing great
ioy to see such a Miracle, called
the poore man vnto him; &amp; first

said: I beleeue you very well, for
me thinketh ye cannot see well

God and his holy Martyr, I can
see now as well as any man. Yes
can? (quoth the Duke) what colour
is my Gowne? Then anon
the Beggar told him. What colour
(quoth hee) is this mans

forth without any sticking, hee

common wealth, which is proved
by some reasons, but especially by
examples.

my selfe haue seene more

making a godly &amp; profitable

am perswaded hee spake by so
much the more from the conscience,
and by consequent to the
conscience, by how much the
lesse he trusted his papers or his
minde was distracted by the
sight of his auditors: tending to
which purpose it is a merry iest
howbeit seriously related by
him who hath written Bedaes
life, that his guide perswading
him one day as he passed by an

heape of stones, that the people
(according to their wōted mā
                  ner)
were there assembled to
heare him preach; the good old
man moved at his speech, vvas
content to giue them a sermon,
but there beeing no body present
to say, amen, at his conclusion,
the very stones cried out
amen venerable Priest, by which
meanes being then baptized by
the name of venerable, he hath
retained it ever since. Of better
vse &amp; more certainety is that history

the refuting and beating down
of the Arrian heresie thē a foot,
Didimus an excellent divine but

blind in both his eies, came thither
to visit him; the sharpnesse
of whose wit S. Antony admiring
demaunds of him whether
hee conceaued any griefe or no
for the want of his sight; which
Didimus seeming by his silence
and modesty to confesse, the
other replies that hee could
not but much marvaile how
so wise a man as himselfe could
bee mooved with the losse of
those eies, which were commō
to him with mice and flies and
gnats, and not rather reioice in
the fruitiō of those which were
proper to Saints and Angels.

meditation or soliloquie.
               
                  
                  THese and the like considerations
may in some good
measure, serue to qualifie the
griefe conceiued for the losse of
that sense, which by iust proofe
we finde in vse to be more dangerous
then necessary; &amp; withal
rouse vp our thoughts to these,
or the like heauenly meditatiōs.
I haue lost I confesse the fruition
of the fight of the heavens; but
by that losse I knowe the worth of
that fruition the better; and now
mine eies is ever fixed vpon the
soone of righteousnesse, the fra

                  mer
and governour of the heavens.
Mine eies were the guides
of my body: but now mine advantage
is that whereas mine eies at
their best could not prevent many
casuall mischiefes, now all the
eies of my friendes as a continuall
sentinell watch more tenderly over
mee, the angels pitch their
tents about mee, and hee that neither

slumbreth nor sleepeth is my
keeper. True it is that I cannot
read good bookes as I was wont,
but my children can supply that
with lesse paine to mee, and more
profit to them; well then, I will
not bee c
                     •
                  st downe for the losse of
my sight which is subiect to so many
diseases from within, and casualties
from without, but I will
rather reioice for the vse of my
hearing the sense of wisdome and
religion, by which God speakes to
me out of his word, and of my
tongue by which I speak
                     •
                   to him
againe in praier. Good God how
many in the world are blinde in
faith and religion? As Atheists,
and Pagans, and Turkes, and
Iewes, and Heretickes, and Idiots;
how many in iudgement and
reason? As children and fooles▪
and mad men, and dotards, and
drunkards; what infinite numbers

in their affections, with anger,
with feare, with loue, with malice,
with envy, with pride, who
like the Idols of the heathen haue
eies and see not? All which
kindes of blindnesse, as they are
in extent more vniversall, so are
they in their nature more dangerous
then that of the bodie, vnto
which also, all flesh in time
must subiect it selfe, when the
keepers of the house shall tremble,
and they waxe darke that
looke out by the windowes.
Why should I then lament as if I
were alone or with a few onely
vnfortunate? Wee see when the
great eies of the world, the sunne
&amp; the moon are eclipsed &amp; darkned,
they still shine notwithstanding
vpward, &amp; after a while recouer
againe their light downeward.
Why should I thē murmure
if the eies of this little world bee
ecclipsed, since I knowe that inwardly

toward mine owne soule &amp;
vpwardly toward God, the light of
my minde is inlarged? And which
is more, am sure that my Redeemer
liveth &amp; he shall stād the last
on the earth, &amp; though after my
skin wormes destroy this body, yet
shal I see God in my flesh, which I
my selfe shall see &amp; mine eies shall
behold him &amp; none other for mee.
Thou ô Lord wilt lighten my candle
the Lorde my God will lighten
my darknes, thy word ô Lord is a
lāterne vnto my feet, &amp; a light vnto
my paths, teach thy servant the
way ô Lord, &amp; lead me in a right

&amp; in thy light shal we see light, even

darknes, &amp; the darknes cōprehē
