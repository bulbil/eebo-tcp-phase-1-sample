            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               WORTHY SIR,
            
            
               YOur earneſt requeſt, to have a Tranſcript of this rude and raw Diſcourſe, ſodainely conceived, and ſorrily cemented, out of your affection to the partie, whom in ſpeciall manner it concerned, could not but prevaile with me, to recollect it, while it was yet freſh in memorie, and to commit that to writing, as well as I could call it againe to mind, whereof I had no more then ſome generall heads and briefe notes ſcribled in a looſe paper before:

mine obligations to you, and your intereſt in me, of right affording you power to command from me a greater matter then that your requeſt amounted unto. And how Quod eſt potentiſſimum imperandi genus; rogabat, qui jubere poterat, Auſon. Idyl. 13. powerfull requeſts are, backt with ſuch engagements, it is both commonly well knowne, and generally acknowledged. But ſince your requeſt therein ſatisfied, I have received it backe againe from you, with ſignification of the importunitie of divers friends, who out of that reſpect they bare to the partie deceaſed, while ſhe lived, and deſire of the continuance of the memorie of her with them, have beene no leſſe earneſt ſuiters unto you, to have Copies from you of the ſame. Which being a worke over-troubleſome, to make ſo many Tranſcripts, your ſecond requeſt was, that with my conſent it might be made more publike. To which purpoſe alſo, you had remitted it to me, that I might, if I were content to condeſcend thereunto, upon review of it, adde or alter in it what I ſhould thinke fit, ere it came out. Now howſoever it was never intended by me for the Preſle; nor indeed have I at preſent any deſire or purpoſe, to adde ought in this kind to thoſe things that I have publiſhed alreadie; nor did your former motion to me concerning it, extend it ſelfe any

further, then to have it as a

And upon occaſion hereof, I have indeed reviewed it, but altred nothing at all of moment, in the maine body of it; that thoſe who were preſent at the deliverie in the Pulpit, might not reade any other then what they then heard: Onely the quotations of Scripture, and ſuch ſhreds or parcels of exotike Language, as might be ſome rub to an Engliſh Reader, but had beene indifferent to your ſelfe, I have removed into the Margine, and ſet on a little more Lace there, to make the Piece ſomewhat ſutable to the reſt of my Works, that are in hands abroad alreadie. So onely fourbiſhed, I returne it againe entire to you, as by free donation
               
your owne formerly; Sive tegenda habeas, ſive legenda putes, Auſon. ad Drepan. to be diſpoſed of by you, either for your owne private uſe, (which would beſt like me) or for the publike, as your ſelfe ſhall pleaſe. And thus with heartie wiſhes of all health and happineſſe to you, as well in your preſent condition, as in the alteration of it alſo, if any hereafter ſhall enſue, I take leave, and reſt
            
               Yours ever much obliged,

For if Christ be God (as undoubtedly he is) and he be with us, as Matth. 28, 20. he hath promiſed to be for ever with all thoſe that be his; then may we well ſay with the Apostle, 
               Rom. 8. 31.

               If any man will come after me, he muſt renounce himſelfe, and take up his croſſe every day: not, take it up, and not dye upon it; (That is the manner and guiſe of hypocrites, ſaith Ferre crucem &amp; non mori, bypocri

            But the maine Point that I ſhall pitch upon, and deſire to inſiſt moſt upon at preſent, is this; to wit, that,

               Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my ſpirit: So our Saviour, on the Croſſe, at point of death, uſing alſo the ſame words; Luk. 23. 46. 
               Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit: So bleſſed Steven here, drawing now his laſt breath; Lord Ieſus, receive my ſpirit. So S. Peter exhorteth all good Chriſtians to doe: 1 Pet. 4.

               Let them in well-doing commit their ſoules unto God. And ſo S. Paul profeſſeth that he had done: 2 Tim. 1. 12. 
               I know whom I have trusted (to wit, with my Soule) and to whom I have committed it.
            
            And it is, as a point of great equitie, ſo a point alſo of good policie, for Gods people ſo to doe.
            
               
               Reaſons hereof, the very places before produced afford not a few.
            For firſt, he is their Father. It is our Saviours ground:Reaſon 1.

               Father, ſave me from this houre. And indeed, whom ſhould children in diſtreſse and danger reſort and ſeeke to, for ſuccour, reliefe, ſupport, and protection, but to their Parents? Or whom ſhould Gods children commend their ſpirits unto in the like caſes, but to him, that is Pater Spirituum, the Pater ſpirituū. Hebr. 12. 9. 
               Father of their ſpirits, their ſpirituall Father?
            
            Secondly, he is their Creator. That is one of S. Peters
               Reaſon 2. grounds: 1 Pet. 4. 19.

                  Matth. 18. 11. 
               to ſave. And whom then may the Soule better for ſafetie betake it ſelfe to, then to him, that hath undertaken to ſave it? The rather, ſince that no ſafetie can be had for it by any

other. For Act. 4. 12. 
               there is no ſalvation by any Name, but by this alone.
            
            Fifthly, he is able to keepe and to ſave whatſoeverReaſon 5. in this kind he ſhall be entruſted with. 2 Tim. 1. 12. 
               I know, ſaith the Apoſtle Paul, whom I have trusted; and that he is able to keepe that that I have committed unto him: his Soule, he meaneth, which he had truſted him with. It is ſaid of our Saviour, that Hebr. 5. 7. 
               he ſought unto him, that was able to ſave him. And well and wiſely doe the Saints and ſervants of God, in commending their ſoules to him, that is Eſai. 63. 1. 
               able to ſave; yea, Eſai. 43. 11. 
               alone able to ſave, both themſelves and their ſoules.
            
            Sixthly, he is as able, ſo willing; as powerfull, ſoReaſon 6. 
               faithfull: That is another of Saint Peters grounds; 1 Pet. 4. 19. 
               He is a faithfull Creator: (Non creat, &amp; creata non curat. August. de verb. Dom. 10. 
               Not one that createth, and careth not for what he hath created, ſaith Auguſtine) And as a faithfull Creator, ſo a faithfull Redeemer; (Pſal. 31. 5. 
               Thou hast redeemed it, ſaith David, O Lord God of Truth) one that Pſal. 9. 10. 
               never failed any of thoſe, that repoſed trust in him. Pſal. 34. 22. 
               The Lord (ſaith the Pſalmist) redeemeth the ſoules of his ſervants; and none that trust in him, ſhall periſh.
            
            Seventhly, it is their onely ſafetie ſo to doe. For,Reaſon 7. as Bernard obſerveth, ſpeaking of thoſe words; 1 Sam. 16. 14. 
               The Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evill ſpirit moleſted him;

            Laſtly, it is not in vaine, or without good ground,Reaſon 8. that they ſo doe, but with aſſured hope of good ſucceſſe; they have good aſſurance of faith, that they

ſhall ſpeed in this their ſuit.

            By all which layd together, it may evidently appeare, that the people of God doe as well wiſely and ſafely, as juſtly and equally, in the committing and commending of their ſoules unto God.
            
            Now this may firſt ſerve to controule and condemne the vaine, fond, and inconſiderate courſe of thoſe of the Romiſh Synagogue; who, in ſuch caſes of danger and diſtreſſe, or when they lye a dying, are wont, paſſing by God and Christ, (whom the bleſſed Saints and ſervants of God, as you have heard, uſe to ſeekeVſe 1. unto) to commend their ſoules to the creatures, to the Virgin Mary, to this Saint, and that Saint; as if they either were better able to ſave them then Christ, or had better intereſt in them then he. But thus Ierem. 2. 13. 
               they forſake the fountaine of living waters, and betake themſelves to broken Ciſternes, that cannot affoord any; while they ſeeke for ſafetie to thoſe, who Luk. 1. 42. Phil.

               not able to ſave themſelves: and of whom we may well ſay, as thoſe ſometime of Saul, 
               1 Sam. 10. 27. 
               How ſhall this man ſave us? How ſhould ſuch perſons be able to ſave others, as had not might enough to ſave themſelves?
            Secondly, this may give encouragement and heartiegraceVſe 2. to Gods people, againſt feare of danger and diſtreſse, yea, even of death it ſelfe; ſince that they have a Christ, a God, an Almightie Saviour, a moſt powerfull

               Protector, whom they may commit and commend their ſoules unto, in ſuch caſe, and upon ſuch occaſions. Indeed, Prov. 18. 11. 
               the rich mans wealth is a ſtrong tower in his conceit, ſaith Solomon. But, alas, this his imaginarie Fort faileth then, when he hath moſt need of it, when it ſhould ſtand him moſt in ſtead. For, Prov. 11. 4. Ezck. 7. 19. 
               Riches availe not in the day of wrath; and much leſſe, at the houre of death. No, then it utterly faileth them, and their hopes fall to ground with it. For, howſoever the wicked (and ſo the worldly) man may

               The ſecond Question, that may be mooved, andDoubt 2. 
               Doubt, that may be made, is, Whether God will be wiling to accept of it, or no. For Legato renunciari poteſt, A Legatariis &amp; fideicommiſſariis Legatum relinqui poteſt. 
               a Legacie, though bequeathed and given never ſo ſolemnly, yet may be refuſed:

                  em cogitur. 
               None are bound to accept of Legacies, unleſſe themſelves will; and ſuch as are matters of meere charge, we ſee many times refuſed. It is a queſtion therefore not unworthy the diſcuſſing, to examine, whether God will be willing to accept of it, or no. For many commend their ſoules to him, and yet he accepteth not of them; many bequeath them to God, and yet the Devil ſurprizeth them, and carrieth them away with him to Hell, for all that. And it is a point not unworthy our due and ſerious conſideration, to underſtand, and be well and truly informed, what courſe we may take, to be aſſured of this, that God will be willing to receive and accept of our ſoules, when they ſhall be in ſuch manner commended unto him: the rather, for that our eternall ſafetie and welfare dependeth mainely, yea, wholly hereupon.
            Wouldeſt thou know then, how this ſo weightieQueſtion. a worke may be effected?
            Take it briefely in theſe few Directions.
               Anſwer.
            
            Firſt, addict thy ſelfe to the ſervice of God, while thouDirection 1. 
               liveſt, if thou wouldeſt have God to take charge of thy ſoule, when thou dieſt. For, Pſal. 34. 22. 
               The Lord, ſaith David, redeemeth the ſoules of his ſervants: and, Pſal. 86. 2. 
               Lord, ſave thy ſervant, that putteth his trust in thee. Thou muſt be, with David, a ſervant of God, while thou livest, if thou deſireſt that God ſhould take thy ſoule into his cuſtodie, when thou dieſt. Otherwiſe, if neglecting and rejecting the ſervice of God now, thou ſhalt abandon thy

ſelfe to the ſervice of ſinne and Satan, to thy worldly courſes, to thy fleſhly luſts; it ſhall be a juſt thing with God, when thou commeſt on thy death-bed, to commend thy ſoule unto him for ſafegard, in that dreadfull and Heram illam decretoriam prospice, Sene

            Secondly, reconcile thy ſelfe to him, while thou liveſt, ifDirection 2. thou deſireſt to commend thy ſoule to him, when thou diest. For what hope can a man have, if he ſhall commend his children, his charge, on his death-bed, to one, whom he hath beene at enmitie with all his life long, that he will be content to accept of ſuch a Legacie as that? As Eliphaz therefore adviſeth thee, Iob 22. 22. 
               Acquaint thy ſelfe with God, and make thy peace with him; make a friend of him now, that thou mayeſt find a friend of him then. But that thou canſt not, unleſſe thou commeſt out of thy ſinnes: for, Peccatores &amp; Dei hoſtes, voces convertibiles. Pſol. 37. 20. Rom. 6. 8, 10.

Maro Aeneid. lib. 5. licet reclamante Seneca epiſt. 66. where Vertue and Beautie doe concurre, they give much luſter mutually either to other. And ſo was it with her; her inſide was ſutable to her outſide, or ſuperiour rather unto it: God had dealt largely and liberally with her, in regard of either, and in that part eſpecially, that is the more to be regarded. He had endowed her with a greater meaſure then ordinarie, in that Sex eſpecially, of wiſdome, of diſcretion, of understanding, of knowledge how to behave her ſelfe ſo, as her behaviour ſhould be, not inoffenſive onely, but very gratefull and acceptable to thoſe, that had either intereſt in her, or occaſion to converſe with her.
            
               And what God in this kind had beſtowed on her, ſhe was carefull accordingly to imploy and improve.

In generall, ſuch was her ſweet, diſcreet, and well-tempered demeanure, as gave abundance of ſatisfaction and contentment, not to them alone, that it pleaſed God ſucceſſively to joyne her unto, but to their friends, and thoſe that had intereſt in them; yea, to all, familiars or ſtrangers, of what ſtate and degree ſoever, that had occaſion to repaire to them, and to be entertained with them. Iſſue indeed ſhe had none: it ſeemed good to God, to denie her that bleſſing. But to the children of ſome of them, that God had joyned her unto, ſhe was no ſtep-mother, but as carefull of procuring their good, and as forward to performe any good office for them, as if ſhe had beene a naturall Mother unto them: That, which ſome of them, were they ſurviving, I know, would freely teſtifie; and thoſe of them that doe ſurvive, if they be not extremely unthankfull, cannot but right willingly acknowledge. And ſome of her first Husbands kindred, beſide others not a few, ſhe brought up as carefully, as if they had beene her owne children. In a word, ſhe was ſuch an one, as Eccleſ. 7. 28.

But theſe things, in this our Sister were ſeaſoned with grace. She was a woman, as of a vertuous, ſo of a gracious diſpoſition: and this her gracious diſpoſition was manifeſted in two things eſpecially, her Pietie, and her Charitie.
            
            To begin with the latter. For her Charitie,

               reaſon and religion require it ſhould ſo doe) at her kindred and allies, I meane; of whom, not a few (as I touched in part before) were relieved and ſupported by her; there ſeldome or never wanting ſome or other of them, that were either educated with her, or maintained neere to her. But neither did her charitie ſtay and ſtint it ſelfe there, with them that were with her, as at the Well-head; but the ſtreames of it iſſued out &amp; diſperſed themſelves abroad to poore neighbours of all ſorts, on every ſide of her. Divers penſioners ſhe had, that in a conſtant courſe received the fruits of her bountie; but no other were excluded from taſting thereof, and that liberally and largely, when

occaſion ſo required. For ſhe was (which I take to be 1 Cor. 13. 4. two principall properties of Charitie) as very Hebr. 13. 1. 3. 
               pitiefull and prone to commiſerate the wants and neceſſities of others; ſo no leſſe 1 Tim. 6. 18.

               bountifull and forward to communicate thereunto, as well by perſonall aides, as by free and liberall ſupplyes. And whereas ſhe had pretie skill in matter of Phyſick and Chirurgerie, (as indeed what was ſhe not skilfull in?) in this kind ſhe was exceeding helpfull, by Waters and Medicines, as well as advice, to ſuch poore ſoules as were not able to entertaine Phyſician, or to goe to the coſt of procuring Phyſick; being not onely as Phyſician, but as Apothecarie alſo to them. In regard of which her charitable both diſpoſition and practiſe, as I doubt not, but that ſhe both had the prayers of the poore, that 2 Cor. 9. 12.

Among which, ſhe profeſſed her ſelfe to be much affected with ſome, becauſe they ſeemed to her to write, as ſhe ſaid, not to ſhew their learning, but out of their owne ſenſe and feeling; of that, no doubt, that ſhe felt alſo together with them, and which cauſed her therefore the rather ſo much to affect them.
            Yea, one good proofe of her pietie may be this: That for her better advancement and improvement therein, in her laſt choice, among many Matches moved to her, (as one of her parts &amp; meanes could not want motions) yea, and ſome of them not lightly to have beene diſregarded; yet paſſing by all other, ſhe pitched upon one, of whom, in regard of his preſence, I will not ſay what I might; onely this I will ſay, one that ſhe juſtly deemed might be a prime instrument of procuring and promoting her ſpirituall progreſſe in the work &amp; courſe of grace. And that this was her maine end and aime in that her choice, ſhe manifeſted by a ſpeech (which I may not let paſſe) uttered by her to him at the time of her enter-marriage with him, (at what time ſhe ſtated him for his life in the houſe ſhe lived in; that which his paſtorall charge there afforded him not) and remembred againe by her in the time of her late ſickneſſe; I ſettle
               
               thee here for the Earth, that thou mayeſt ſettle me for Heaven. And as this was her maine end therein, ſo her deſire and endevour was to make uſe of it accordingly, (for ſhe was not one of Solomons fooles) that Prov. 17. 16. 
               have a price in their hands to get wiſedome with, but have no heart or minde, wit or will, to make that uſe of it.) To which purpoſe, I remember, that repairing ſometime to viſit them, (that which mine engagements to either of them required, and had beene more frequent, but that diſtance of place, neceſſary employments, &amp; craſineſſe of body reſtrained it) when he and my ſelfe were in her preſence talking together, of the occurrents of the time, and ſome points of Schoole-learning, ſomewhat out of her element, and above her ſpheare, ſhe ſtrooke in with us, and requeſted us to diſcourſe rather of ſomewhat, that ſhe might alſo receive ſome benefit by, that might be uſefull as well to her as to us.
            But I forget my ſelfe: The time ſpendeth, and my ſtrength and ſpeech with it; and I muſt therefore of neceſſitie omit many things, that might elſe have well beene mentioned.
            I draw toward an end, together with her end. And the Termi

               The latter part of a mans life carryeth it away from the former, ſaith another, if the latter be not anſwerable to the former. But it was not ſo with her. The cloſe of her life was ſutable to its fore-paſſed tenor, in renewed acts of pietie and

               charitie enter-woven together the one with the other. For, beſide other Legacies, to the value of three hundred and fortie pounds, and upwards, by the free conſent of her worthy Conſort, diſpoſed to pious and charitable uſes; ſhe hath given to this Pariſh, wherein ſhe drew her firſt breath, the ſumme of foure pounds per annum for ever; partly, for a Sermon, a worke of pietie; and partly, for the reliefe of the poore, an office of charitie. And to the Church of Lambeth, in which Pariſh ſhe ſpent the greateſt part of her life, and gave up her laſt breath, ſhe hath bequeathed a faire Communion Cup, to be rayſed from the ſale of ſome of her principall Iewels; that ſo thoſe ornaments (I give it you in her owne words) that had adorned her, while ſhe lived, might adorne the Church of God, when ſhe was dead.
            
            In her laſt and fatall ſickneſse, her cariage was ſuch, that her

                  ietie and her patience might have ſeemed to contend for the ſuperioritie, but that they were ſo ſweetly combined together, that the one was expreſſed and appeared in the other. Nor is it to be marvelled, if it were ſo with her; for ſhe freely profeſſed to ſome of thoſe that reſorted to her, That ſhe had alwayes beene carefull to lay up in ſtore for the great day of her diſſolution. Patience ſhe ſtill prayed for, frequently uſing that ſweet and pious ſaying of S. Auguſtine;

               Lord, give what thou commandeſt, and command what thou pleaſeſl. And patience ſhe practiſed. For it is credibly reported by thoſe that were moſt and neereſt about her, that albeit her paines and torments were very great and grievous, yet no one idle word, or ſpeech ſavouring of impatience, was ever heard to fall from her. And, when thoſe that attended her, offred ſometime to have removed her for her eaſe, (and paine, we know, maketh perſons uſually deſirous of

oft removall) ſhe refuſed it, ſaying, That ſhe ſhould ſhortly be removed; to a better place and ſtate, ſhe meant.
            The Evening before her departure, ſhe requeſted Prayer (of which alwayes ſhe was much deſirous) to be continued by her, untill two of the clock; about which time, (which was not before underſtood what ſhe meant) as if it had beene ſome way revealed unto her, her ſenſes ſo failed, as ſhe could not longer be apprehenſive of ought done about her.
            Her laſt words were, not much unlike that of S. Stevens here; Sweet Ieſus, helpe me: And, with the Spouſe in the Apocalypſe; 
               Apoc. 22. 20. 
               Come, Lord Ieſus, even now. With which words her ſpeech failing, yet ceaſed ſhe not, ſo long as any uſe of ſenſe continued, to lift up inceſſantly both hands, while abilitie ſo to doe laſted; and the one of them ſtill, when the other of them failed; thereby giving notice of her heart inwardly lift up unto him, who by his gracious hand at length tooke her hence, and received her to himſelfe.
            With whom leaving her at peace and reſt, in joy and bliſſe, let us likewiſe lift up our hearts and hands to him; humbly beſeeching him, that he will be pleaſed to make the things now ſpoken uſefull unto us, and to prepare and ſit us for the like end. Amen, and Amen.
