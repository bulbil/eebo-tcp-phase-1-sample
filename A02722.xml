            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               WHereas you requeſt mee to enlarge my ſelfe in ſome paſſages of my former Sermons touching Conſcience, againſt this new Impreſſion: I haue reſolued rather to adde two new Sermons of the ſame ſubiect, than to alter any thing in the old, and this I haue beene led vnto vpon theſe reaſons. First, becauſe I would haue you deale firmely with all men in the venting of Copies. Secondly, becauſe that labour would haue beene as tedious to me as this. Thirdly, becauſe I haue now added ſomething touching the vſe of Conſcience, which my former text would not ſo fitly beare; My requeſt vnto you is double; firſt, that you would be carefull in obſeruing ſtops, interrogations
and diſtinctions, which neglected, the ſence becomes ſometimes darke, ſometimes imperfect and none vt all, as is tobee ſeene in ſome paſſages of the Sermons on Prouerbs and Samuel. Secondly, that you will ſeuer theſe ſo from the former, as that who ſo pleaſes may haue them alone. Thus reſting in your care for the due publiſhing of all, I commend you and the worke to the Lords bleſſing.

               Yours, ROBERT HARRIS,
            
         
      
      
         
            
            TWO SERMONS, VVHEREIN VVE are taught, 1. How to get, 2. How to keepe, 3. How to vſe a good CONSCIENCE.
            
               
                  
                     HEB. 13. 18.
                  
                  Pray for vs, for we truſt we haue a good Conſcience in all things, willing to liue honestly.
               
            
            
               OF the Apoſtles motion ſo much: Followeth now his reaſon; where, firſt, the Aſſertion, I haue a good Conſcience in all things:] Secondly, the Euidence and confirmation, I am perſwaded:] ſo vpon this ground, I deſire to liue honestly. The points we note are two: Firſt, the Apoſtle ſecures the
thing (a good Conſcience.) Secondly, hee reſts in the confirmation of it.
            From the firſt this:
            Euery Chriſtian ſhould ſo order the matter, that hee may truly ſay, Doct. 
               I haue a good Conſcience: This the thing that muſt be made good, and aſſured; to wit, a good conſcience. Here, leſt it be objected, that the point holds in ſuch as the Apoſtle was, (Preachers) who muſt be men of Conſcience, not in all; Wee, muſt doe two things; firſt, ſee what warrant we haue for the raiſing; next, for practizing of the point. Our warrant for deducing a generall from this particular, is fetcht; firſt, from the end and vſe of the word in generall, namely, our inſtruction, as appeares, Rom. 15.4. and 2 Tim. 3.16.
            Euery Chriſtian ſhould ſo order the matter, that hee may truly ſay, Doct. 
               I haue a good Conſcience: This the thing that muſt be made good, and aſſured; to wit, a good conſcience. Here, leſt it be objected, that the point holds in ſuch as the Apoſtle was, (Preachers) who muſt be men of Conſcience, not in all; Wee, muſt doe two things; firſt, ſee what warrant we haue for the raiſing; next, for practizing of the point. Our warrant for deducing a generall from this particular, is fetcht; firſt, from the end and vſe of the word in generall, namely, our inſtruction, as appeares, Rom. 15.4. and 2 Tim. 3.16.
            Secondly, from that generall precept of this Apoſtle, Phil. 4.8, 9. Furthermore, brethren, whatſoeuer things are true, whatſoeuer things are honeſt, whatſoeuer things are iuſt, whatſoeuer things are pure, whatſoeuer things pertaine to loue, whatſoeuer things are of good report, if there be any vertue, if there be any praiſe, thinke on theſe things, Which yee haue both learned, and receiued, and heard, and ſeene in mee: thoſe things doe, and the God of peace ſhall be with you.
            
            Thirdly, from the like preſident, Heb. 13.5, 6. Let your conuerſation be without couetouſneſſe, and be content with thoſe things that yee haue: for hee hath ſaid, I will not faile thee, neither forſake thee: So that we may baldly ſay, The Lord is my helper, neither
will I feare what man can doe vnto me. Whence the inference is to all from one, Ioſhuah.
            
            Fourthly, from Reaſon, though examples (as examples) ſimply binde not, yet reaſon and precept (that is to ſay, the Law of Nature and of God) doe binde: and therefore, when the Example is grounded vpon common equity, and hath nothing priuate in it (vnleſſe haply for degree onely) and is backt by precept, then it's binding. Now thus ſtands the caſe here: Firſt, A man, as he is rationall (much more as he is a Chriſtian) is to regard his Conſcience. Secondly, the Apoſtle, not onely in his Miniſtery, but in all other Relations and paſſages of life, minded this, Acts 23.1. &amp; 24.16. nay, further, as his life was rifled into by the aduerſaries, with his Doctrine; ſo he Apologizes for that, with this, and grounds his perſwaſion, as much vpon his Chriſtian liuing, as his faithfull preaching. Laſtly, the precept reaches all, as well as Preachers: and there's as good reaſon, why we as well as they, ſhould aſſure conſcience. For the firſt, the precept is no leſſe large, then plain; 
                  1. Precepts firſt, for getting: ſecondly, keeping: thirdly, vſing of a good Conſcience.
            For getting: we are called vpon to waſh the heart, Ierem. 4.14. To waſh off all filthineſſe of ſpirit, 2 Cor. 7.1. to ſtudy vniuerſall holineſſe, 1 Theſ. 5. and the end of the Commandement is, a good Conſcience, 1 Tim. 
               
                  〈◊〉
               . 5.
            Secondly, for keeping: Salomo
                     •
                  a addreſſes
himſelfe to all and each particular, Pr. 04.23.
            Thirdly, for vſing: Heb. 10.22. In all our approaches to God, wee muſt waſh the Conſcience, as the Iewes did their fleſh and rayment.
            For the ſecond: 
                  2. Reaſon.
               
                  1. Equity,
                  2. Neceſſity,
                  3. Vtility perſwade the practice:
               
Firſt, wee are dependant, 
                  1. Ab
                     •
                  oaeſto. and therefore accountable as well as Pauls; ſoules we haue receiued, and for a ſoule and ſpirit muſt euery one anſwer: Lawes we haue alſo receiued, and by Law we muſt be iudged; we are vnder the ſame Iudge, the ſame Law, the ſame cenſure that others be, and muſt hold vp our hands at the ſame barre; and therefore muſt haue the ſame thoughts, and care of Conſcience: Books muſt be compared, Gods and ours, Originall, and counterpane; therefore we alſo muſt haue our Bookes fairely kept, and a readineſſe.
            Secondly, 
                  3. A neceſſitate. there lyes the ſame neceſſity vpon vs, as vpon Pauls, of ſecuring Conſcience: for firſt, if we looke inward, wee ſhall finde our hearts as crazy, our graces as feeble, our peace as vnſettled, as theirs: and on the other ſide, our ſecret guile, and guilt, and pride, and vnbeliefe, as great as theirs. And next, if we looke outward; wee finde the world the world ſtill, that's a Sea, our life a warfare, wicked men as buſie with others conſciences as euer; the Diuell as malicious as euer; troubles without, terrours within, as ſtirring as euer: in ſhort, as
much vſe and neede of a good Conſcience now, as 1000. yeeres agoe; a Preacher may ſtand ſomewhat higher then our ſelues, but wee are in the ſame ſtormes, there's none other difference.
            Thirdly, It will quit coſt for vs alſo, 
                  3 Ab vtili. to get good conſciences: for, theſe are the preſeruers of all graces; 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   Tim. 1.19. the Conſcience is that bottome that containes all our treaſure; that casket that holds all our Iewels; if this miſcarry, farewell faith, hope, patience, courage, truth, all. Secondly, Conſcience is the root of all our comfort: the fruit of righteouſneſſe (ſaith Eſay) is peace: Eſay 32. out of a cleere conſcience, iſſue thoſe ſweet ſtreames of ioy, comfort, &amp;c. Thirdly, Conſcience is the antidote againſt all poy ſoned croſſes; it is the ſting that is in our conſciences, that ſteeles all our croſſes, and makes them ſtinging; there's little mudde raiſed in the ſoule, where the conſcience is cleere and pure.
            Fourthly, Conſcience is the bulwarke, Hic murus abeneus eſt &amp;c. and wall of braſſe, that keepes off all inuaſions and aſſaults, Ephiſ. 6. By this a man raignes ouer all tribulations, Row. 8. and is enabled to looke flames in the face, Lyons in the face, raylers in the face, ſlanderers in the face, Diuels in the face, God in the face, with an vndaunted countenance, 
                  •
                
               Iohn 3.21. &amp; 4 17.
            On the other ſide, take away conſcience, and you plucke vp the ſluces, and pull downe the
bankes, you let out the ſoule into all licentiouſneſſe; for what bounds hath the ingenuous ſpirit, when feare and ſhame (the immediate iſſues of conſcience) are gone? where will a man ſtay? Man without conſcience, is a wilde horſe without bridle; the life and heart is filled with ſinne, after ſinne comes guilt (from that light that's left) thence tormentfull ſhame, feare, anguiſh; hence the leaſt noyſe affrights him, the leaſt croſle ſtings him, the leaſt danger appales him; in ſhort, reſt there's none, peace none, courage none, comfort none; but conſcience rages like an aking tooth: a man eates in paine, drinks in feare; dares not goe abroad, dares not goe to bed, dares not ſleepe, leſt his dreames ſhould proue terrible; dares not wake, leſt his wounds ſhould bleed againe, and his watchfull cares and feares recoyle. By this little ſaid, you ſee how it imports vs all, as well as S. Paul, to conno this leſſon, and to ſay readily, I, and I, and I, and euery I, haue a good conſcience. But all that can be ſaid, is but an empty diſcourſe, and a contemplation farre off from the matter; for the truth is, no man can tell what the benefit of a good, what the miſery of a bad conſcience is, but he who hath felt both; that man is but a ſtranger to himſelfe, and to conſcience, that doth not apprehend a thouſand times more, then hee can vtter in this kinde. It ſuffices to ſay, that no man knowes the badneſſe of a bad, the goodneſſe of a good conſcience, but onely
he that hath felt the weight of that, and worth of this; and hee that knowes leaſt experimentally &amp; feelingly, knowes more then his tongue, face, eyes, hands, bones can vtter, though they ſpeake all at once, as vſually they doe, when Conſcience workes ſtrongly. But I paſſe to application; where, firſt, three ſorts come to be taxed: ſecondly, all to be taught.
            For firſt, if all ſhould aime at this, Vſes. 1.
                to ſay (and to ſay truely) My Conſcience is good, three ſorts of men are farre wide of the marke.
            Firſt, they who neuer trouble their thoughts with conſcience at all; credit, wealth, friends theyle ſecure, if they can: but for conſcience, tis onely a name, a ſcarcrow to affright children withall; but no wiſe man will ſtand vpon that: and leſt they ſhould ſeeme madde, they plead reaſon for their practice.
            
               
                  Obiect. 1 Firſt, there's no man liuing,  but hee ſtraines and diſpenceth with conſcience in ſome things: take me the beſt Preachers; doe not they ſpeake, yeelde, walke contrary to conſcience, in ſome things? Name me your beſt Chriſtians: doe they not know cenſuring, enuy, &amp;c. to bee naught? doe not they ſpeake againſt ſome ſometimes, whom in their conſciences they know to be better men then themſelues, and ſo of all the reſt?
            
               
                  Sol. 
                Thus they plead in the firſt place: but this
is a wilfull deluſion, for firſt, What if all the world ranne wilde? Noth will be Noah, vpright in his generation ſtill. Secondly, Is it well to ſtraine? If not, wilt thou be naught for company. Thirdly, Thou art deceiued, there is many a Paul, 
                     Luk. 1.6. Zacharie, Elizah, that walke in all the Commandements of God, and would not purpoſely liue in the leaſt allowance of the leaſt ſinne,  for all the world. 
                  Object. 
                But yet they doe ſo? 
                  Sol. 
                Firſt, if vpright, they doe not ſo; if they doe ſo, they be not vpright: 
                  1 Cor 12. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &amp;c.
                indeed the moſt vpright knowes but in part, loues but in part; he may ſinne, becauſe he knowes it not to be ſinne; hee may ſinne againe, being ſurprized in ſome one particular, Gal. 6. againſt his generall purpoſe. Thirdly, he may be yoakt as S. Paul was, with thoſe inward buffetings that may make his heart ake, and his ſoule to cry out, Oh wretched man that I am, &amp;c. Rom 7. But if thou thinkeſt that any vpright man can thus reſolue, I doe, or may know, this courſe I line in, to be ſinnefull, and yet I muſt not, I will not taken tice of it, make conſcience of it, thou erreſt; a godly man cannot thus ſinne, and reſolue. Secondly, whoſo doth, Verſ.

                But Conſcience is like the eye; if one begin to ſalue it, or to meddle with it, there is no
end, a man ſhall nener inioy himſelfe, but there will be ſcruple vpon ſcruple, feare after feare, ſinne vpon ſinne; tis an endleſſe taske to purge the Conſcience, I anſwer,
            
               
                  Sol. 
                Firſt, the queſtion is not, how painefull it is, but how needfull? there is ſmart and trouble in ſearching wounds, yet they muſt be ſearched.
            Secondly, the matter is feizable: S. Paul by trauell may arriue at this happy hauen, firſt, I haue a cleere, ſecondly, I haue a good Conſcience.
            Thirdly, dead fleſh is not the beſt fleſh, nor conſcience awakened, the worſt conſcience.
            Fourthly, though Phyſicke for the time ſtirre humours, and playſters cauſe ſmart, yet both that and this tend to health and eaſe: ſo thinke of the preſent troubles and ſits of conſcience.
            
               
                  Object. 
                O, but he that will ſtand vpon Conſcience in this age, ſhall dye a begger, or be begd for a foole, he ſhall haue trickes enow put vpon him, if he be ſo tender?
            I anſwer, firſt, what if it were ſo? a man had better faſt then ear poyſon; begge, ſtarue, pine, then ſell his conſcience: Aske them in Hell, aske them that are vpon this racke, they will ſay ſo: as for diſgrace, I had rather haue all the world call me foole, then mine own conſcience; and conſcience will befoole me, if I ſell heauen for earth, kernels for ſhells, pearlos for pibbles. But, ſecondly, what neceſsity in this conſequence?
Why may not truth, and innocency, and conſcience, maintaine and credit mee, as well as lying, coozenage, flattery, baſeneſſe? Why ſhould not I thinke Gods wayes as good as Satans? Thirdly, What loſt Abraham, Ioſeph, Daniel, Mor
                     •
                  ecai, Dauid, &amp;c. by keeping a good conſcience? Verily, if a godly man doe not thriue, conſcience is not in fault: let him rather fault (if there be a fault) improuidence, idleneſſe, pride, diſtruſt, admixture of ill means, not conſcience.
            
               
                  Obiect. 
                But many that made as little adoe about conſcience as I doe, haue made a good end at laſt; they haue dyed without feares, or if troubled a little, vpon ſome ſatisfaction made, and ſome charitable workes done, all was huſht and well?
            
               
                  Sol. 
                I anſwer, firſt, thou knoweſt not what conſcience others made in life. Secondly, Thou knoweſt not what ſecret pinches conſcience giues them on their death-bed. Thirdly, Its one thing to ſatisfie after ſinne committed: another, to ſinne purpoſely, in preſuming vpon future pardons and ſatisfactions. Fourthly, a bleeding wound is better then that that bleeds not. Fiftly, Some men goe crying to Heauen, ſome goe laughing and ſleeping to Hell; the queſtion is not what conſcience feeles moſt, but what is moſt ſicke? Some Conſciences as well as men, lye ſpeechleſſe before departure. Thoſe are but poore ſhifts to put off thoughts of conſcience,
vpon theſe grounds, yet this is the firſt errour.
            A ſecond ſort; They labour the matter of Conſcience much, but how? Their worke is not to perſwade their owne hearts with Saint Paul, but other mens. A ſtrange folly, for a man to be more carefull of others then himſelfe; to feare others, to prize others aboue himſelfe: yet this is ordinary: Men ſtudy rather to ſeeme, then to be conſcionable; labour more to approue themſelues to others; then to their owne hearts; and this appeares thus: Firſt, in that they ſtand more vpon the forme, then the power of godlineſſe. Secondly, in that they ſet the beſt ſide outward, be more in profeſsion then in action; better abroad then at home; Satis eſt principem externa ſpecie pium—Videri, &amp;c. de princ. c. 18.
                a farre off then at hand. To theſe I ſay but this: Firſt, this is but Machiauels Diuinity: They haue not ſo learned Chriſt. Secondly, this is but the Hypocrites guiſe; He makes cleane the outſide, he iuſtifies himſelfe before men onely. Thirdly, this is but a childes part, who makes his mother beleeue that his ſores heale, when they rankle, and ſhewes his right hand for his left. Laſtly, this is a poore remedy, to couer a broken arme with a braue ſcarfe: Alas, thou muſt anſwere Conſcience, when all friends bee abſent: time will be, when death will ſnatch thee from men, and Conſcience will follow thee to Chriſts barre; then if thou canſt not ſtand before thine owne heart, how wilt thou ſtand
before him, who is greater then thy heart? Poore man, poore man! thou maiſt eaſily deceiue men, poſsibly deceiue thy ſelfe: but if thou canſt not approue thy heart to God, thou art loſt; for him thou canſt not deceiue. As for thoſe who make bold to father all vpon Conſcience, and vpon God, who wipe their impudent mouthes with the Harlot, and ſay, What haue we done? Who appeales to God with innocent Dauid and Paul, Iudge me, O Lord: I lye not, my conſcience beareth witneſſe, God knowes my heart: I take on my conſcience, that I am vniuſtly ſlandered, when tis neither ſo, nor ſo; what will become of theſe men? with what faces will they looke vpon that conſcience, that Iudge, whom they haue made partakers, witneſſes, Iudges, reuengers of their damned hypocriſie, and more then diuelliſh impudency! But leaue them to the racke.
            
                The third ſort perſwade themſelues of their integrity and ſpeake it out with Pauls confidence, We haue a good Conſcience. But would their confidence were as well bottom'd as his: but alas, Men build this their aſſurance either in the ayre, or on the ſands: ſome are perſwaded without reaſon, ſome vpon very weake reaſon. For the firſt, they haue (yea that they haue) as good Conſciences as any of them all. But what's their proofe? They are perſwaded ſo. But vpon what reaſons? Why, they hope ſo. But vpon
what ground? Why, their minde giues them ſo. Firſt, poore men! Conſcience is reflectiue, knowes its knowledge, vnderſtands it ſelfe: Secondly, its rationall, and can giue a reaſon of its hopes: Thirdly, its regular, and proceedes by the rule of Scripture: Shew mee thy grounds in blacke and white, elſe tis fancie, not Conſcience.
            Secondly, others alledge reaſon, but they cannot perſwade a reaſonable man who is not willing to winke; they are chiefly theſe.
            Firſt, a good meaning: I am (ſaith the ignorant) no Scholler, many can put me downe with words, and doe make a greater noyſe, but I meane as well, and haue as good an heart to God-ward, as any of them all?
            
               
                  Sol. 
                I anſwer, There is a latitude and meaſure of knowledge required of all, Without ſome knowledge, the minde is not good, Prou. 19.2. If the eye be ſtarke blinde, the whole man, and the wayes of man are ſo too; and to ſpeake of Conſcience without knowledge, is to ſpeake of contradictions, and to talke of ſeeing without ſight, hearing without eares; ſuch is knowledge without knowledge, that is, Conſcience. Tis certaine, Conſcience reaches no further then knowledge, at leaſt then habituall, and implicite, or generall knowledge. The confidences of an ignorant are but the fruits of his pride, and his ſcruples, the iſſues of his trembling opinion and
ſtaggering iudgement: tis true, weake knowledge (ioyned with humility and care of growth) muſt not be diſcouraged; but whoſo neglects knowledge, preſuming vpon Conſcience, doth as if he ſhould pull out his eyes, and truſt to his hands for guidance.
            
               
                  Obiect. 
                The ſecond Reaſon alleadged for their hope of Conſcience, is from the troubles that they haue in their hearts; for when they haue done amiſſe, their conſciences be eftſoons vpon them, and will giue them no reſt.
            
               
                  Sol. 
                I anſwer, this may conclude ſome Conſcience, but not neceſſarily Pauls, 
               Differences betwixt conſcience and conſcience from the Text. (that's to ſay) a Naturall, but not a Spirituall Conſcience. The differences of which two, are wide, and for the diſcerning thereof;
            
                Firſt, ſee for what ſinnes thy heart ſmites thee, if onely for crying ſtaring ſinnes, which the light of Nature from inward principles or outward inſtructions prompts; it is not the Conſcience now in ſpeech, Paul had a good Conſcience in all things.
            
                Secondly, ſee what reformation this trouble workes; if none, take heed, Pauls Conſcience is ioyned with (deſires and) endeauours of obedience for the future.
            
                Thirdly, ſee whence the trouble ariſes, whether from a contrariancy betweene ſinne and thee, or betweene Conſcience, and paine, and puniſhment onely: Pauls conſcience is troubled
with the filth as well as guilt of ſinne, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                and his will is preſt to goodneſſe for its beauty.
            Fourthly, ſee whither this trouble driues  thee; Pauls carries him to Chriſtians, to Praier, Watchfulneſſe, Beware: A Naturall Conſcience proues a naturall man, but no more; thou canſt not claime kinred of Paul vpon ſuch a Conſcience; with Turkes and Heathens thou maiſt.
            
               
                  Ob. 
                The third ground is this: My Conſcience doth not onely checke me for what's paſt, but curbs and reins me in: before ſin be committed, I dare not doe as the moſt doe; nay, I dare not omit good duty: Should not I reade, pray euery day, I could not ſleepe in the night, &amp;c. I anſwere,
            
               
                  Sol. 
                It muſt be conſidered whence that feare ariſes; for tis certaine, that very cuſtome and education will make a child afraid to omit his deuotions when he goes to bed: if we will eſtabliſh the heart with comfort, wee muſt make good two things:
            
                Firſt, that we worke vpon right motiues not onely becauſe ſuch hath beene our cuſtome, ſuch our education, ſo is the will of our Parents, &amp;c. but becauſe wee need ſuch helpes, God loues ſuch ſeruices, and we finde ſtrength comming vpon ſuch performances.
            
                Secondly, that we heed the manner of performing, as well as the matters performed, not reſting in the worke done, but mourning for
our dulneſſe, diſtractions, coldneſſe, and other failings in the doing; for this is once, there's nothing more ſhames and humbles an vpright man, then his ouert and ſlight performance of his Maſters worke.
            
               
                  Obiect. 
                The third ground they ſettle vpon, is their peace: their ſinnes doe not daunt them, nor their Conſciences dampe them; all is quiet within, and they haue no doubts of their ſaluation.
            
               
                  Sol. 
                I anſwer, There is the Diuels peace, and Gods peace: there is a negatiue peace, or ceſſation onely of torment; and a poſitiue peace, or fruition of comfort. Therefore, examine firſt, the ſource and raiſing of thy peace: for ſome are quiet, becauſe the conſcience is either blinde, and ſees not the ſword againſt it, like Balaam; or ſlothfull and ſleepy; and a very ſore man may feele little in his ſleepe; or elſe either ſeared or deluded: a deluded ſence thinkes it feeles or ſees what in truth it doth not; and ſeared fleſh doth not ſmart like other fleſh, not becauſe it hath more life, but leſſe ſence: ſo here.
            Secondly, The meanes how thou commeſt by it: there is no peace but in Gods wayes; if I winne it not by praver, digge it not out of Gods ſauing wels and ordinances, finde not the Word ſpeaking peace to my ſoule, I cannot haue it; our peace comes in at the eare, as the
Church ſpeakes, and out of Gods mouth; God creates peace by his word and lippe, 51.8. Eſa. 57 19. as Eſay ſpeakes: vnleſſe it beare his ſtampe, and haue Holineſſe to the Lord written vpon it, tis not right, twill not paſſe as currant.
            Thirdly, The effects of it: holy peace workes thankfulneſſe to Chriſt, humility in vs, mercifulneſſe towards bruiſed ſpirits.
            
               
                  Obj 
                The fourth ground is this: I cannot abide vnconſcionableneſſe in others; I can with no patience ſee men goe againſt Conſcience.
            
               
                  Sol. 
                I anſwer, The Diuell is a great rifler and accuſer of others conſciences; but a conſcionable man is buſieſt at home, mildeſt abroad: be ſo, or be nothing.
            
               
                  Obiect 
                But I ſtraine at the leaſt ſinne. 
                  Sol. 
                So did the Phariſee: Conſcience is not right,  vnleſſe it ſtraine at all ſinne, endeauour all duty, as Paul ſpeakes in both tables; conſider, compare, and ſo paſſe ſentence; and here an end of this Vſe: now to Inſtruction.
            
                And here, would all that heare me this day, were as Saint Paul, his bonds excepted: It ſhall not be needfull to ſay much to thoſe who haue felt heauen and hell both in their conſciences, they ſee the difference; as for others, what can I ſay, when as men cannot beleeue me without experience? If they would receiue others teſtimonies, they may well conceiue, that a good conſcience is beyond all created
goods, and a bad worſe then all poſitiue euils: for firſt, What ſo deſireable to all liuing things, as life? What will not men part withall for life, 
                  Iob 2 4. though it be from skin to skin? yet conſcience is ſuch a thing as wiſe men prize aboue life; they'le dye a thouſand deaths, rather then loſe conſcience; and whilſt they liue, they liue no longer then Conſcience ſpeakes peace. Looke vpon an experienced man, and when he hath loſt his peace, no meate, no place, no wealth, no company, no life is pleaſant; he onely liues, becauſe he dares not dye.
            Secondly, for an ill conſcience; What more terrible and hatefull to Nature, then death? yet death is ſweet to a wounded Conſcience; did hee thinke that death would end his torments, he would not liue; nay, though he apprehends a iudgement, a hell at the heeles of death, yet many times hee ruſhes vpon it, and concludes, that certainly hell can be no worſe, and probably better then an ill conſcience.
            Loe (my Brethren) what Conſcience both wayes is; one ſo ſweet, that Heauen would be no Heaven without it: the other ſo bitter, that Hell is no Hell to it in the iudgement of experience. I can ſay no more to perſwade; mee thinkes now nothing ſhould remaine but direction. And the way to ſet you in Pauls circumſtances, is to guide you; firſt, to the getting: ſecondly, to the keeping of a good Conſcience.
            
            
               1. How a good Conſcience is gotten. For the firſt, reſolue firſt on the thing, and thus conclude; What-euer it coſt me, what ſhift ſoeuer I make, I muſt haue a good conſcience. 
                  Ʋideatur. Aug. is Pſ. 30. &amp;c. It is not neceſſary to haue wealth; a poore man may be honeſt here, happy hereafter. It is not neceſſary to haue health, a weake man may to heauen. Nay, it is not neceſſary that I muſt liue, my happineſſe is not confined to this life; but tis neceſſary to get a good Conſcience; without this, I can neither liue nor dye, be neither rich nor poore, ſicke nor well; in few, I cannot ſubſiſt, I cannot be (vnleſſe this be a being, to wiſh I neuer had beene) without a good conſcience; and therefore what-euer it colt me, Ile goe to the price thus firſt reſolue, and this done then hearkē; to the means, which are theſe: Firſt, goe to the right meanes: there's but one Phyſician for ſoules and conſciences, and that is God; he onely made, and hee onely remakes good Conſciences; none elſe can come at Conſcience, can take out the poyſon that's there; take off the guilt that is there; and therefore wee muſt carry our wounded ſoules to him, alleadge his owne covenant and hand, and ſay; Lord, thou haſt ſaid that thou wilt take away our euill heart, and giue vs a better, now for thy truths ſake make good this Word, this Scripture. This done, thou muſt attend his method, and run his courſe and dict he preſcribes, &amp; thou muſt follow this method;
            
            
                Firſt, make thy Conſcience bright and lightſome: hee hath written a phiſicke for conſcience (no phyſicke booke for conſcience but his) from this Booke thou muſt gather knowledge, for darkeneſſe defiles the vnderſtanding, as Paul faies, and darkeneſſe is timorous and ſtaggering; a man can haue no true, no poſitiue peace, whilſt hee liues in darkeneſle, either all things, or nothing ſhall be lawfull; and where tis ſo, the heart cannot be comfortable, therefore to thoſe principles that yet ſticke in the ſoule, adde ſome other: adde light to light, the light of the Word to the light of Nature; for the Word is written to helpe that darkeneſſe, and that light is ſo dimme and ſmall, that wee muſt needes ſet vp another by it, elſe wee ſhall ſee nothing; and hee that ſees nothing, enioyes nothing: therefore thou muſt get knowledge by reading, by deducing coucluſions from Gods actions to thy ſeife, by hearing and ſetting thy ſelfe, if thou be free, vnder that Miniſtry that deales with Conſciences, that ſets out God as he is, the Word as it is, ſinne as it is; for then we truely know, when we know things in their owne notions and colours.
            
                Seconly, thou muſt make the Conſcience cleane; it muſt be pure and cleare, before it will be good: there ſtickes to the conſcience of euery man naturally a great deale of guile and filth; It is much diſabled and maimed, loſt
much of its ſight and life, it hath learned to be idle, falſe, dumbe, &amp;c. It hath contracted ſo much guilt, foulneſſe, brawnineſſe by trading in ſinne, that there's do roome for peace, till it hath a new conſtitution, and be wholly reſined: now the way to haue it cleanſed, is to flye to bloud: as in the Law all things were purified with bloud, ſo here the bloud of Chriſt is that, that cleanſeth from all ſinne, that waſheth the Conſcience from dead workes; this bloud is both healing, and will cloze all our ſcarefull gaſhes; and purging and will take off all ſtains, an will make vs as white as ſnow. O goe to this Refiner, this Fuller, this Phyſitian, this high Prieſt, as the Word entitles him; nothing will ſerue, but his bloudy ſacrifice, and that will doe it; goe to him as to an All-ſufficient Sauiour, reſt in his bloud without further mixtures; plead his bloud ſhed for ſinners quite lost and vndone; beg that of God, asd Rahel did children of her husband, Giue me bloud or elſe I dye; apply that to thy bleeding ſoule, and ſay, I bleed; but Chriſt bled too for me; my ſinnes are bloudy, and his woundes are bloudy too; my bloud, if ſpilt, cannot make God that ſatiſfaction that his bloud hath, and therefore Ile reſt in his bloud that ſpeakes peace, not vengeance, as Abels did, and in him who quiets Conſciences as well as Seas and windes, Mar. 4.39. Elſe, as corrupt breath ſtaines and dimmes the
glaſſe: ſo a corrupt heart the Conſcience. Next, when it is cleare from guilt and filth, then it muſt be pure and ſanctified, the Spirit therefore of Grace muſt reſt in the Conſcience, and giue it a new conſtitution; it is not ſufficient to let out the bad bloud, but now wee muſt breed good bloud, and make new Spirits. From a naturall Conſcience, and a Conſcience that is enlightened by the Word, we muſt proceed to a ſanctified Conſcience, and therefore we muſt labour to feele the power of Chriſts Bloud, and of Chriſts Life and Reſurrection in our ſoules, (who is King of righteouſneſſe and peace both, Heb 7.2.) quickning vs in the Inner man, and ſtamping on vs our firſt impreſſe of wiſedome, holineſſe, righteouſneſſe, that we may be throughout ſanctified, 1 Theſ. 5. and haue a beauty ſet vpon the ſoule and conſcience in all points, as the Apoſtle ſayes, and freed from dead workes by repentance, Heb. 9. and when the Conſcience is filled in ſome due meaſure with light, and freed from ſinne, and furniſhed with poſitiue grace, then (out of all) reſults that goodneſſe of Conſcience that now we ſpeake of, whereby its fitted for its ends and offices, and enabled to giue vs a good word and countenance.
            
               2. How 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  
                     •
                  ept. Now for the keeping of Conſcience good, becauſe I will not ouercharge your memories with rules, Ile expreſſe my ſelfe in one continued
Similitude or Allegory. The Conſcience is a Clocke or Watch in the boſome; look what you would doe to keep that in frame, that muſt be done heere.
            
                Firſt, If the Watch be amiſſe, who ſo fit to amend it as hee that made it? So heere, if any thing trouble Conſcience, that it goes not at all, or too faſt, or out of order, goe to Chriſt, and goe quickly, pray him to ſet theein ioynt againe, as Dauid did, Pſal. 51.
            
                Secondly, a Watch muſt be charily kept, the leaſt duſt, hayre, iogge almoſt diſtempers it; ſo the Conſcience, a little duſt in this eye marres both ſight and peace, a little ſinne crept in betweene the wheeles, ſets all at a ſtand: if euer thy Conſcience ſhall hold its comfort, and doe thee acceptable ſeruice, keepe it cleane, giue no allowance to any the leaſt ſinne: a man may liue and dye in ſome ſinne, and yet haue peace, when Conſcience is not priuy to it, and not conuinced of it: But there can bee no true comfort, where ſinne vnderhand is maintained and allowed, be it neuer ſo ſmall a one: let thy Conſcience haue this to ſay for thee: I can beare him witneſſe, that he bore his ſinnes as a burden, and bid none of them welcome.
            
                Thirdly, a Watch muſt be daily lookt to (and thorowly too) if one pin be amiſſe, all is out of order: ſo the Conſcience; hee that makes not conſcience of all (according to his light) makes
conſcience of none, and wil come to naught; and he that doth not looke vpon his conſcience euery day, and winde it vp, and ſet it in frame, will haue no conſcience in time: euery day thou muſt talke with thy ſelfe, and know what the Watchſaith, I meane, what report Conſcience makes of thy dayes worke, what it hath to ſay for or againſt thee. 'Tis with conſcience, as with Bay liffs and Stewards; if you call them to a daily reckoning, they will be carefull and vſefull; but if you let things runne on, and reckon once at the hundreds end, they will not watch, or they will not be able to remember: ſo tis with conſcience; therefore often looke vpon it, and euery day conſult with it.
            The Watch muſt be vſed, elſe it ruſts, furres, and firſt begins to ſlacke its pace, and after ſome time will not goe at all: ſo conſcience, tis preſerued by vſe, as the ſtomacke is, and all things elſe; for euery thing is perfected and preſerued by its proper operations; as water is kept ſweet by running, the Conſcience by motion ſtrengthens it ſenſe, and ſooner feeles its weight: by motion it is facilitated and that's as good as oyle to the wheele of a Clocke; therefore exerciſe Conſcience, and that in all good duties, whether perſonall or locall.
            
                Corſcience muſt haue its full walke, and thats very large; for a Conſcience is to bee obſerued in all religious and righteous
acts; and whoſo will preſerue his conſcience, muſt firſt keepe himſelfe pure and vpright. Firſt, in Gods worſhips: Secondly, in workes of righteouſneſſe towards man: Thirdly, in his owne place, he muſt make conſcience of his particulat calling and relation, and dwell vpon that: and ſecondly, for others, hee muſt remember Pauls aduice, Keepe thy ſelfe pure, be not partaker of other mens ſinnes. In ſhort, of all things hee muſt feare God moſt; of all men, feare himſelfe moſt and his owne Conſcience; of all men out of himſelfe, feare his friends moſt, and his other mens ſinnes. Many a man waſhes his heart at home, and defiles his Conſcience abroad; when he hath gotten his owne acquittance, hee intangles himſelfe in other mens debts by conniuence, ſilence, conſent, &amp;c. Take heed of this, for tis a hard matter to diſcharge conſcience in company and to come off well. Well, let conſcience haue its perfect worke towards God and man, alone, and in company, and like a good fountaine, twill worke out its owne corruption and mudde, and affoord ſomething towards the waſhing of others too, as it runnes along.
            
                One thing more, and then an end: As a Watch muſt be made, ſo ſet by rule: you muſt ſet it by the Sunne and time of day: So Conſcience muſt haue its rule (though a ſubordinate rule it ſelfe) and this alſo muſt be ſet and ordered
by the Heauens: the great God hath onely power ouer his great office, and he in his Word is the iuſt meaſure of it: we muſt not ſay that's lawfull which he prohibits, that's ſinfull which he commands, that's arbitrary which hee holds neceſſary, that's neceſſary (for its nature) which he holds arbitrary: in ſhort, wee muſt neither widen nor ſtraiten the rule, but bring home our ſelues to that. Its hard to ſay where wee ſhall land, if we ſayle not by the Compaſſe, and looke not to the Heauens, and whether bee worſe to ſwallow all, or ſcruple all, is more then I can tell! This is once, he that either tyes vp, or lets out his Conſcience, more then God would haue him, makes worke for himſelfe, and way for temptation. In practice, tis good to bee of the reſtraining hand, where we are left to ourſelues: but for Opinion, Conſcience, and Iudgement, tis beſt to hold ones ſelfe free where the Word frees him, and bound, where the Word bindes him, elſe Conſcience will ſuffer wracke.
         
         
            
            THE SECOND SERMON: Wherein is taught, how to vſe a good CONSCIENCE.
            
               
                  
                     HEB. 13. 18.
                  
                  Pray for vs, for we truſt we haue a good Conſcience in all things willing to liue honeſtly.
               
            
            
               THE ſecond thing followes. Paul hauing gotten a good Conſcience, emproues it, and makes his benefit of it, partly for the remouing of aſperſions, partly for the obtaining of praiers, and the engratiating of himſelfe with the Hebrewes. The point.
            
            They that haue good Conſciences, muſt make their vſe of them. Doct. 1.
                This point calls more for practice then for proofe; therefore we will be larger there, briefer heere. Firſt, God calls vs to this duty, Eſa. 5. Iudge, ye inhabitants, &amp;c. 3.— as if he had faid, I appeale to your Conſciences, who will be of vſe in this caſe to you, if you will vſe them: Cap. 1. &amp; 2. ſo Haggai, Conſider, faith God, with your ſelues, compare time with time, thing with thing, how well you ſhall ſpeed if you will be ruled by me, how ill you haue ſped whileſt negligent of me: and accordingly reſolue, as if he had ſaid, If you would but reflect vpon your ſelues, and conſult your owne Conſciences, reformation would follow. So alſo Pſal. 4. Pſal. 4.4 Talke with your owne hearts; as if he ſhould ſay, Doe but aske your owne Conſciences? Is not this Gods doing? Did not God preferre Danid? Doth not hee maintaine his Titles? Would wee our ſelues reape that meaſure that we offer him? And then ye will be quiet. Thus often in the new Teſtament: 1 Cor. 11. &amp;. Examine your ſelues, 2 Cor. 13. &amp;c. Iudge your ſelues, Trie your ſelues, Bethinke your ſelues: Reu. 2. All comes to this, Turne your thoughts vpon your ſelues, and make vſe of your inward light, that is, Conſeience. Thus the precept is cleare, the practice thereof much vrged; the neglect thereof, as much condemned, Ier. 8.6. and elſe-where often.
            
            Adde ſecondly, to the Precept of God, the practice of Gods people, in their paſſages with God and Man.
            Firſt, For God: Marke Abimelech, when he was hazarded; Gen. 20. leremiah, when hee was curſed; ler. 15. Hezekiah, when hee was viſited; Eſ. 38. David, when hee was ſlandered, Pſal. 7. The Apoſtles, Acts 4. when threatned; and ſee what vſe they made of a good Conſcience. How free, quiet, bold, couragious in all thoſe exigents they were.
            Secondly, and for Men, looke vpon Ioſeph, firſt tempted, after perſecuted: vpon Samuel reiected, vpon Iob traduced, vpon Paul atraigned; and ſee what benefit they made of Conſcience, now to raigne in luſts and paſſions, now to prouoke to iuſt apologies, alwayes to ſupport in greateſt preſſures.
            Thirdly, from Examples, paſſe wee to Reaſons.
            Firſt, Conſcience is made for vſe, Reaſons. 1.
                and therefore vſe muſt be made of it: The excellency of things ſtands in their vſe, the beſt things being euer moſt vſefull; now in this world there is nothing more Diuine and (as I may ſay) more God-like then Conſcience. It is a kinde of ſecondary Law and Bible, yea, in a ſort, a ſubordinate God, of ſubdiuine authority. It hath power to enforme, to record, to witneſſe, to iudge, to condemne, to abſolue, to comfort,
to execute, to hang and draw within if ſelfe, as we ſpeake in other caſes; and we cannot without too too great neglect of God, who makes nothing in vaine, paſſe by ſuch an Officer and Deputy as Conſcience is, without vſe and acknowledgement.
            
                Secondly, we take Gods Name in vaine, in neglecting Conſcience, and fruſtrare his work, and depriue our ſelues of the benefits of Conſcience; for tis not the hauing, but the vſing of abilities and bleſſings that perfects and bleſſes vs. A power of ſeeing is to little purpoſe, if men will winke and hide themſelues in darkeneſſe. A power of ſpeaking is not much, if a man will button vp his lippes; and of as little auaile is Conſcience (that is, a power of knowing and gaging ones ſelfe) if this power be neuer acted. Verily, a man notwithſtanding this inward light, may be no better then an Atheiſt in knowledge, or Diuell in practice, vnleſſe hee emproue his light; (for light, till the Will put it to vſe, makes no man good) for dee but conſider. How (I pray) ſhall that ſoule for matters paſt euer repent, which will neuer recoyle, looke backward, or once ſay, What haue I done? How (againe) ſhall it ſee its preſent ſtaines and eſtate, if it will not view it ſelfe, or behold its owne face? How (thirdly) ſhall it be held back frō any ſin (fleſh, men, diuels, puſhing on) if it neuer commune with it ſelfe, ſaying,
What am I doing? It were impoſſible that men ſhould either digeſt ſuch morſels as they ſwallow, or ſwallow ſuch puddle and poyſon as eftſoones they doe, would they but ſee and conſider what they doe, or haue done.
            
                Thirdly, by not vſing Conſcience, wee ſhall come in time to loſe, not onely the comfortable ſeruice of it (for enformation, reformation, conſolation, inſtigation, &amp;c.) but indeed all manner vſe, and ſence of it: Vſe legges (wee ſay) and have legges; ſo, vſe Conſcience, and haue Conſcience; for by vſe, the heart is kept ſoft, and will ſoone ſmite vs, as Danids did: by vſe our inward light is exercifed and ſtrengthened, and wee made able to diſcerne, Heb. 5.14. Nay, vſe and exerciſe doth both facilitate and delight; for what's done ordinarily and habitually, is done with no, ſmall content, ſure with no great contention and reluctancy: cuſtome and exerciſe make the hardeſt of works at leaſt ſufferable. On the other ſide, difuſe Conſcience, and though it continue in the roote, yet the fruit will downe. Firſt, the light of it will more and more decay, like the fire that is not blowne. Secondly, the life of it will alſo weare, (as the dull ſluggard liues not halfe ſo much as the diligent doth) and this appeares, if we conſider thoſe acts and euidences of life (Senſe and Motion.) For Senſe, a Conſcience vnconſulted, vnexerciſed, vnexamined, becomes like a
ſleepy legge: when a man hath ſate long, hee feeles not his limbes, the bloud and ſpirits being ſometimes frozen and arreſted with cold, ſometimes intercepted in their paſſage by too much ſuppreſsion of that part: ſo tis with the Conſcience; firſt load it, and then let it lye ſtill without motion, and in fine it will not feele it ſelfe, but be as dead and ſenceleſſe, as brawned, yea ſeared fleſh: And this experience iuſtifies in many, whoſe conſciences lye bedridden: and looke how ſome (in that caſe of ſickneſſe) voyd much filth and feele it not: ſo theſe ſpue forth abhorred blaſphemies and outrages, and diſcerne them not. As for Motion, euen as the limbs by long ſitting grow ſtiffe and ſtarke, that we cannot goe: ſo the conſcience vnfrequented, twill ruſt like a Clocke which ſleepes a winter or two, and ſo loſes its tongue, not once telling you where you bee either in the day or night: iuſt ſo a ruſty Conſcience, twill neither counſell nor comfort, checke nor excuſe, twill ſpeake neither to matters paſt nor to come, but lie as dead within a man, as the dead childe doth within a woman: Oh tis a moſt comfortleſſe thing for a liuing woman to beare death in her bowels! ſuch a burden fils her with many feares for the preſent, at leaſt makes her too too heauy and vnweldy, and puts her to great extremity in the cloze, there being more adce with one dead birth, then with two
liuing children tis no better with a dead conſcience; the leſſe that trauels, the more we muſt with feares and anguiſh; and therefore as wee call vpon women, to ſtirre, that their fruit may be ſtirring too: ſo muſt we ftirre vp our ſelues, that Conſcience may be doing; for a dead conſeience makes but a dead eſtate, a dead heart, a dead man, a dull life; and dead it will be, vnleſſe we put it to vſe.
            Now before we can proceed to exhortation, Vſe I.
                we cannot but bewayle and controll two ſorts of men firſt, ſuch as vtterly diſuſe, ſecondly, ſuch as ſearefully miſuſe their Conſciences. How many bee there of the firſt fort, who liue and dye ſtrangers to themſelues? They dare not for their eares aske their own hearts: What is our caſe? In what tearmes ſtand we with God? Children are we or enemies? In the wayes of life or death? Where are we? What are wee? Which way goe we? What will be the iſſue of our courſes? But looke how bankrupts put off reckonings, ſo theſe allreaſonings with themſelues. And as they keepe their ſpirituall eſtate cloſe from their owne conſciences, ſo doe they in particular actions: for, firſt, in ſhings to be done, they rather conſult others then themfelues, which is, but to ſel ones eies, and buy ſpectacles, which ſee no more then the eye enables them. Secondly, in things already done, they rather ſmother then conſult conſcience: when
Conſcience takes the aduantage of ſolitarineſſe, and beginnes to queſtion them, they runne from it into company, and hide themſelues in the croude; when Conſcience beginnes a little to open its eyes and mouth after the reading of ſome booke, the hearing of ſome Sermon, the ſeeling of ſome inward or outward pinches, they ſtoppe their eares, diuert their thoughts, ſing, whiſtle, drinke, game, and doe any thing to out-talke and drowne Conſcience. This the practice of hundreds, but how ill this practice is, firſt the Cauſes, ſecondly, the Conſequences will ſhew.
            The Cauſes hereof, The cauſes of this diſuſe. Firſt, Pride: Man would be ſomebody with himſelfe, and therefore is loth to looke vpon his owne ſtaines, and to ſee his owne face in the face of his conſcience. Secondly, Hypocriſie: Man hath ſuch a deſire to coozen, that hee would (if he could) coozen himſelfe, and would faine make himſelfe beleeue that tis not ſo bad with him, as indeed it is. Thirdly, Vnbeliefe: He lookes for no mercy, in caſe he peach himſelfe, and therefore places all his ſafety in ſecrecy; and ſo ſecret would he be, that by his will, his left hand ſhall not know what his right hath done. Theſe are the cauſes: and what fruit can you in reaſon expect from ſuch a roote?
            Surely the iſſue cannot but bee bitter: The conſequences. For, Firſt, by diſuſing Conſcience, men come to
loſe conſcience, and conſequently their armour againſt ſinne: take away Conſcience, and you can hardly ſet downe Atheiſme. Secondly, by this meanes ſinne is exceedingly aggrauated; (for no man can neglect ſo neere a Monitor as Conſcience is, without great preſumption and wilfulneſſe:) and ſecondly, a mans reckoning no way furthered; for (doe what we can) wee muſt come to an account, and Conſcience will know vs at laſt, whether we acknowledge it or not; nay, by how much the leſſe we regard it now, by ſo much the more it will ſhake vs hereafter, and riſe vpon vs like a flame with ſo much the greater fury, by how much the more it was (for the preſent) kept downe and ſtifled.
            The ſecond ſort reproued, Vſes. 1.
                are ſuch as abuſe conſcience, and this is done (as ſometimes otherwiſe) ſo moſtly thus:
            
                Firſt, when Conſcience is ſet loweſt, and bound apprentice to the outward man, I meane thus; when men doe not receiue all blowes that let driue at conſcience, vpon their name, eſtate, skinne, &amp;c. but contrarily, rather ſuffer Conſcience to be wounded, then the outmoſt skinne rayſed.
            
                Secondly, when Conſcience is thruſt from its ſeate, depoſed, degraded, gag'd; ſo violenced, that it muſt not ſpeake, though friends, God, man, call vpon vs.
            
                Thirdly, when conſcience is made a cloke 
for all vnwarranted, both opinions and practices, that is, when men will put the name of conſcience vpon the baſeſt things: Opinion ſhall bee Conſcience; Errour, Conſcience; the ſwallowing of widowes houſes, Conſcience; as twas with the Phariſees.
            
                Fourthly, when Conſcience is made a knight of the poaſt, and muſt beare witneſſe to any vntruth, to any villany: thus when men cannot tell what to ſay, they appeale to God and Conſcience. God knowes, their hearts, their Conſcience beares them witneſſe, they'le take it on their Conſcience, tis ſo, not ſo. O the fearefulneſſe of theſe practices! how terrible haue Gods ſtrokes bin vpon ſuch in all ages? and what can we looke for leſſe, then miſery in this courſe? Firſt, a man muſt be an old and bold offender, before he can dare thus to affront Conſcience. Secondly, it cannot be ſafe thus to abuſe ſo great an Officer as conſcience is. Thirdly, who can expreſſe the terrours of ſome Saints, now vpon record, who (notwithſtanding) neuer were ſo daring? and if they did ſweare vnder ſmaller abuſes of Conſcience, how ſhall theſe bleed?
            I now come to perſwade euery man to make good vſe of a good thing, Vſe 2.
                a good Conſcience; for the abuſe of beſt things is euer worſt: and a good Conſcience is in the ranke of beſt things, It is a wonderfull mercy in God, to match vs with ſo neere a friend, ſo true a Counſellor: let
vs thankefully conſider to what vſes a good conſcience may be put, and accordingly emproue it. We will not runne into the road of conſcience in generall, but confine our ſelues to a good Conſcience, which is ſo tearmed in a double ſence.
            Firſt, Its good formally in its conſtitution. Conſcience how tearmed good.
            
            Secondly, effectiuely in its execution: as a Clocke is good when it is made well and goes well: firſt, the Conſcience is good in its ſelfe, when it is fitted for its proper acts and vſes: the proper and immediate act and vſe of Conſcience, is to know that it knowes, as Salomon ſpeakes to Shimei, and as wee vulgarly ſay, I know what I know well enough. This the generall. The particulars of this knowledge are, firſt, conſcience knowes what we be: ſecondly, what we doe: what we be ſpiritually (not naturally) and in what tearmes we ſtand with God; whether we beare his Image, be in his fauour, yea, or no? what we doe either for ſubſtance or quality, good or bad, either in times paſt, preſent, or to come: theſe things Conſcience was made for, and theſe the conſcience, when it is good, doth know, to wit, both tree and fruit in the inward and outward acts thereof: and hence it is, that we are ſo often inuited to talke with our ſelues; and hereof growes that inward confidence and enioyment, that the ſoule hath of it ſelfe, wherein it reſembles its Maker, who
takes full contentment in himſelfe from his full vnderſtanding of himſelfe. The ſecond act of a good Conſcience is ſpeaking or manifeſting good to vs, being good in it ſelfe, it giues vs due information touching our ſelues; as a cleere glaſſe repreſents a true face: and heere are two acts alſo: Firſt and more immediately it reports things as they be, which is called witneſſing or giuing in euidence: thus the perſon being vnder mercy, it tels him ſo much, hauing already done well, or hauing good things in agitation, it ſaith ſo.
            Contrarily, when things be not right, Conſcience ſpeakes as it finds them, and heerein it doth well; for we ſpeake of a Morall, not Naturall good: and morally that Conſcience is good, that ſpeakes the truth how-euer it be: as thats a good glaſſe that reports blemiſhes (if ſuch) as well as beauties; a good Witneſſe that ſpeakes the truth, though not what pleaſes. Secondly, Conſcience ſtrikes vpon the affections, and doth ſome execution vpon the offender; for from information of eſtate, ariſes either certainty of hope or deſpaire: as the euidence comes in guilty or not guilty, and from information of workes, different affections and motions anſwerable to their different natures: from things well done, comes comfort, ioy, boldneſſe, &amp;c. ill done, ſhame, feare, ſorrow, remorce: from things well intended, courage, reſolution, confidence,
&amp;c. ill meant, (for the future) iealouſie, repining, recoyling, as an horſe that would and would not leape a ditch. In the former reſpect, Conſcience is compared to a Witneſſe, in this, to a Iudge and executioner.
            Now this being the vſe of Conſcience, wee muſt employ it to theſe vſes; namely, repaire to Conſcience, aske its aduice, receiue its report touching our perſons and actions, heare what it can ſay for or againſt vs now; for once it muſt paſſe a verdict vpon vs; and when we haue its teſtimony, wee muſt either appeale to an higher Court (if we can ſhew an errour) or ſit downe by its ſentence, ſtop, where it ſayes ſtop, worke, where it ſayes worke, feare, where it ſaies feare, hope, where he giues hope, reſtore, where it ſayes, reſtore.
            
               VVhen and in what caſes conſcience muſt moſt be conſulted. Howbeit, that our ſpeech may be more fruitfull, know we that in foure caſes eſpecially, we are to conſult and vſe Conſcience.
            Firſt, when wee are in conſultation about things to be done, or beleeued; in this caſe it is not amiſſe to aduiſe with others, but in no caſe muſt Conſcience be omitted.
            I may eaſily deceiue others by ill ſtating of the queſtion, adding, or altering, or ſuppreſſing, as affection leads me: againe, a man may finde ſo many men, ſo many mindes oftentimes, ſo different are their apprehenſions and affections. But a good conſcience is one and the ſame,
and that vprightly conſulted, can ſay more to my affections and intentions, more to the practicall part, then all the world.
            Therefore vſe others if you pleaſe, but make vſe of your owne hearts, elſe your practice may be corrupt, when others counſell is good. Here forget not theſe rules: Firſt, pretend not Conſcience, where Conſcience is not the matter. Secondly, be reſolued of what thou doeſt in thy ſelfe, or elſe forbeare till taught, if thou mayeſt. Thirdly, walke by thine owne light, not other mens; ground thy practice vpon Conſcience, Conſcience vpon Word, not vpon Man. As for caſes here incident, we paſſe them now.
            
                Secondly, when we are vpon a ſelfe-triall, and the queſtion is, either of our ſtate, or our doings, or opinions, conſult conſcience; for that is the beſt created examiner. And here let the maine worke be, to ſinde out the maine point; Am I Gods childe, in ſtate of grace, yea or no? This much imports vs; for as Satan founds all particular temptations vpon this (If thou be the tonne of God) ſo all our particular comforts and aſſurances hang on this pinne. Therefore, here, houer not, but hold Conſcience to it, Either I am, or am not Gods. What am I? What am I? Leaue not this vnreſolued by Conſcience, as many doe, who hearing of a certainty attaineable, and of ſome generall notes of ſaluation from the Word; preſently build conſidence
to themſelues, ſometimes vpon weake principles, ſometimes vpon falſe applications, neuer conſulting Conſcience, and then when Conſcience is awakened, they are miſerably plunged. Beloued, it is not ſo eaſie a matter to aſſure ſaluation as moſt men thinke; we are not all out of their mindes, who deny it poſſible, without extraordinary reuelations, and who hold it ſawcineſſe to auouch it; yet wee muſt tell you, that the difficulties are more then a few, and it concernes vs much to deale much with Conſcience about this point.
            For faith whereby wee beleeue ſaluation is one thing, and euidence whereby wee feele it another; there we muſt cleaue to the promiſe, but here we muſt conferre with Conſcience, as Saint Paul doth, he was ſtrongly perſwaded (by the leſuites leaue) of his ſaluation and vprightneſſe: but what are his grounds? Firſt, his Conſcience was and had beene good in all: ſecondly, his bent and resolution for the future was right; hence he did, hence we muſt aſſure our eſtates.
            Secondly, as we muſt examine Conſcience about our eſtate, ſo alſo about actions paſt; was this well? did I well? ſaid I well? otherwiſe there may be deceit: For firſt, many matters lye hid from men, with their circumſtance: ſecondly, the motiues that ſet the wheele a going vſually doe; here then happy is he who condemnes
not himſelfe in what he hath done.
            Thirdly, when ſlandred, cenſured, or accuſed, whether by men or diuels. Thus Iob, when Satan accuſeth, when friends doe, foes doe, when good men doe, and bad men doe, he repaires homeward, caſts vp his bookes, and finding all right, hee triumphs in his Conſcience, and weares their libels as a Crowne. Like vſe muſt we make of our Conſciences, when accuſed; firſt, ſee whether the charge be iuſt; if ſo, reforme, amend: ſecondly, if not ſo, cleare thy ſelfe to men, if worth while, and if they will be ſatisfied; if not, enioy thy ſelfe, and thine owne innocency. Here the rules be two: firſt, if thine owne heart condemne thee, reioyce not againſt the truth, though all the world applaud thee: ſecondly, if (vpon a true ſearch) thy heart acquit thee, neuer for ſake thine owne innocency: Let not men, nor diuels, nor frownes, nor cenſures robbe thee of thy comfort, but ſet this wall of braſſe againſt all, as Paul. Say what you will, my conſcience is good, and I make this good by theſe and theſe proofes.
            
                Fourthly, when wee become ſuiters to God and man for aſſiſtance, being affronted by men and diuels, and ſeemingly deſerted of God and man, then we muſt flye to Conſcience, as Paul doth, and Dauid, and all the Saints; now calling vpon God, as Hezekiah, O Lord, thou knoweſt I haue walked, &amp;c. Now vpon Chriſtians, as Paul,
Pray for me, for I haue kept a, &amp;c. Now vpon our ſelues, with Dauid, Why art thou caſt downe, O my ſoule, &amp;c. There is truth in thee, beare vp. And this not onely for the preſent, but for future times, when we are threatned as the Apoſtles were, with many ſtormes, with much hardſhip: firſt, make good thy Conſcience: ſecondly, reſt in the comfort thereof; for come what will come, if we bring a good conſcience to a good cauſe, theſe two bladders will hold our heads aboue water. My brethren, till wee haue tryed, we cannot conceiue what the comfort, courage, ſtrength and reſolution of a good conſcience is; make vſe of it, enioy it, and enioy your ſelues, your eſtate, all perſons, all things, all times; onely be ſure, firſt, that Conſcience be regular, that is, that it ſpeake Law, and ſentences all according to the Word written. Secondly, that it ſpeake the whole truth written, and nothing but the truth: Conſcience hath nothing to doe with ſecret counſels, that muſt ſpeake to the action or preſent eſtate; but for reprobation or finall deſtruction; that conſcience can ſay nothing to, as not reuealed; it hath nothing to doe either with abſolute condemnation, or abſolution. Let it keepe it ſelfe within its Spheare, and let me keepe my ſelfe to my time.
            FJNJS.
