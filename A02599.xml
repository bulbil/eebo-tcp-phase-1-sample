            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

And afterwarde Iesus Christe hys eternall Sonne, wyth Peter Paule, &amp; the other apostles, for the newe lawe. Were not the men (thynke yow) wele ouerseane?

lecherouse spretes in the lykenesse of women, they haue (they saye) by the suffren vertu of holy water,The deuyls. turned them into deuyls agayne. But neuer were they yet so connynge with all their holye water, as to make of theyr whores honest marryed women. No, yt is not their ordre, to do suche myracles. In the lyfe of Saynt Godrick is mencyon of a she, deuyll, but in the conclusion, he apereth with hangynge ware of no small quantyte, hauinge hys yonge ones folowynge hym wyth shauen crownes. Of a lykelyhode therfor he was some spirituall he tempted, &amp; hys chyldren wythin holye orders. Such power had Saynt Guthlake ouer those watchinge wormes, that he made them to tarry with hym, and to buylde hym vp a monastery at Ascendyck, now called Crowlande, some saye. To be short in thys matter. Their sayntes in a maner were all vnmaried.Sayntes vnmaried. If anye were maryed that wolde nedes be sayntes, they were anon compelled by othe, or by the waye of penaunce, to leaue their makes to the occupieng of others, the man his wyfe, and the woman her husbande, as ye shal beholde in this boke by most plentuouse examples. For matrimony hath euer bene suche a blacke bugge in their sinagoge and churche, that neuer wolde canonysacyon serue yet, where as was

in place.
                  Notwithstanding we are throughly assertayned by innumerable scripturs and argumentes, that matrimonye is of God, and by their innumerable examples of fylthynesse, that their vowed wyuelesse and husbandelesse chastyte is altogyther of the deuyll. Sens the gloriouse aperaunce of the Gospell haue that Sodomiticall swarme or brode of Antichrist (that ye call the spiritualte) bene oft tymes admonyshed of their fleshlye errours by the manyfest scripturs therof. that they shulde ones repente theyr most horryble myschefes,Votaries. and graunt vnto maryage the fredome due therunto. And what haue they done, thynke you? Nothynge els at all but laughed them to scorne, reportynge them to be but fables and lyes. The learned allegacyons, reasons, and argumentes of Philyp Melāchton, Luther, Lambert, Pomerane, Barnes, and suche other, they haue hearde,Christen doctors. but the answere is yet to make. They mocke and mowe at them like Iack a napes or lyke them which went vp &amp; downe by the crosse whan Christ was crucyfyed, and that is ynough for them. For they haue it of their popes lawe to answere no man, yea although they wryte their abhominacions to the vttermoste,

vnlesse they haue hym in preson. I haue therfor thought yt best,The autour. seynge they regarde not the sacred scrypturs, to laye before them their abhomynable practyses and examples of fylthynesse, by their owne legendes, Chronicles, and sayntes Liues, that all men maye knowe what legerdemaynes they haue vsed, and what lecherouse liues they haue led here in Englande▪ sens the worldes beginninge. Lete them now be ashamed of their beastlynesse, or els put on their mothers face altogither.
                  In the first part of this boke, maye men breuelie beholde how and by whome this realme was firste inhabited, which thynge hath bene hytherto in all Englysh Chronicles,Chronicles. doubtfullie, vnagreablye, yea, and vntrulie treated, vpon coniecturs, fantasies, and lies onlye, by reason of ignoraunce in the scripturs and moste auctorised histories. They shall also perceyue, what peoples haue here by all ages remained, what doctrines hath bene thaught by their true and false prophetes, what worshippinges of God they haue vsed, and what lawes in religion they haue folowed. Finallie they shall knowe clerelie, the deceytfull workemanship of the instrumentes of Sathan, their Bishoppes, prestes,Prestes &amp; monkes, with other disgised locustes of the same generacion.

Whose contynuall stodye, labour, and seking was alwaies to blinde them by a colour of chast lyuynge / makinge them to beleue, that their maryenge of wiues was a prophane layte / a brutishe beastlynesse / and a thynge which greatlye dyspleased God / Their owne vowynge of vyrgynyte was againe (they said) a spirituall ordre, a lyfe of Angels,Marriage. and an holye religon which pleased God aboue all other, what though they neuer had it in their liues. For true virginite is a fayth vncorrupted,Virginite. or a beleue gouerned by the onlye worde of God without all supersticions of men.

Yea must they be canonised sayntes, and do most wonderfull miracles. But those miracles are the stronge delusions (saynt Paule sayth) that the Lord will sende vnto them that shall perish for their vnbeleues sake.Miracles. 2. Thessalon, 2. I doubt not but this labour of mine, though it be very simple, will ministre some light as wele to the learned as vnlearned. At the least it shall teache them to iudge false miracles, that they be no more so deuylishly deceyued.

Yet was not this abhominable supersticion so tyrannouslye handeled among them than,Tyrāny now. as it hath bene sens among their successours the papistes, whom by their cruell coaccions (lyued they neuer so longe) they sent at the last to hell with a conscience adust, were not the lorde more mercifull.

Baruch sayeth there, that their custome was to decke their whores with the yewels and ornamentes of theyr Idolles. Daniel sayeth, that they with them deuoured vp the daylye offerynges and sacryfyces of Bel. Yet Hector Boethius wryteth in the seconde boke of his Scottysh Chronycle, that there were some amonge them, whiche taught one euerlastynge God alone to be worshypped,One god without Image made or other similitude els. Neyther allowed they them (sayeth he) that applyed vnto their Goddes the symylytudes of beastes after

Neuerthelesse yet were they great teachers of sorcerye.

Zachary a marryed priest,Zacharie marryed. and father of holy Iohan Baptist, a man for hys marryage founde iust afore God, reprehended that abhominacion in them, and was cruellye slayne for it, as testifieth Epiphanius lib 2.

All that tyme and a longe season after, the ministers helde their wyues, accordyng to the fyrst ordre of God, without, vowynge or yet professynge of virginite, and so contynued to the dayes of Lucius, whyche is called in the Chronycles the fyrst Christen kynge.Kynge.

Anon therfor he sent vnto Rome.Rome. ij. of those ministers called Eluanus and Meduinus vnto Eleutherius the Byshop (for they had then no pope) to haue some aucthorite from then.

                     AS this newe christianite from Rome, had gotten here of the Paganes both temples and possessions,Tēples. and were wele fauerdlye satled (theyr byshoppes and priestes perchaunce beyng the same ministers that had serued the Idolles in them afore) anon after there arose out of it a certayn kynde of monkerye,Mōkery not in apparell, but in apperaunce of a more sober lyfe. These within a whyle semed better learned than the other, and more depelye fell into the peoples estymacyon. Wherupō arose some after great stryfe and vnquietnesse amonge them, and out of that stryfe moste detestable heresyes.Heresies For one of them called pelagius,Pelagi

                     YEt came there in no vowynge of chastite all thys tyme, neyther was vyrginite thought anye holyer amonge them then marryage. For one Seuerus beyng bothe a monke,Seuerus prieste, and byshop, had a sonne there called leporius a mōke also and a priest,Leporiꝰ. which vexed the lande with that learnynge taught of hys father, in the yeare of our Lorde. CCCCxxxij.432. as wytnesseth both Prosper Aquitannus, and also Flores historiarum. Thys leporius made hys boast, that he was able to lyue purelye of hym selfe, and by force of hys owne fre wyll, wythout the assistence of God, as reporteth of hym, Gennadius Massiliensis,Autours Honorius Augustudimensis, &amp; Iohannes Tritemius, in suis illustrium uirorum Catalogis, and now last of all, Cō

Thys testyfyeth Ranulphus Cestrensis in Polychronico, lib. 4. cap. 29. and Iohan Capgraue in Catologo sanctorum Anglie. If this had bene fowle playe in those dayes, Saynt Martyne would neuer so paciently haue suffered it. For we reade that he was verye tendre vnto the sayd Patrick,Patriciꝰ after that his fryndes had sent hym thydre, and taught hym manye Godly thynges. What rule this Hartrick kepte in that be halfe, I haue not redde. Yet fynde I in hys lyfe wrytten, that

                     TO entre more depely into the peoples opinion, a chastyte was pretensed anon after in that monkerye,Chastite. but not yet solempnelye vowed, and in manye places of the realme were monasteries builded bothe of men and women. But marke what folowed therof immediatly after. Christ chaunced in those dayes to haue many brethren. For many virgins had then chyldren without fathers, at the least the fathers of them were neuer yet knowen.
                     Saynt Dubrice that was afterwarde the great archebyshoppe of Cairlegion and metropolytane of all the lande,Dubricius. had a mayde to his mother, called Eurdila, but neuer wold she confesse hym to haue any father.

They take it for no maruele that Christ was borne of a virgine, for (they say) they haue such among them at all times. But to turne agayn to my purpose. The cause why the fathers of the afore seyde chyldren might not than be knowne, was this. Iohan Capgraue sayth.A awe. The

                     SAynt Dauid of wales the great archebyschop of Meneuia.Dauid. whiche had so manye prophecyers and so manye Angels sente afore to geue warnynge of his comming xxx. yeares ere he was borne, was begotten out of maryage in stinkynge whoredome. For hys mother was a Nonne, and his father the earle of a contrey there called Cairdigam shyre. A prynce called Dyhocus in Kynge Arthurs tyme, inflamed at the deuyls suggestyon with fleshlye loue of his owne naturall doughter, begat of her saynt Kynede the holy hermyte,kinetus. that in Wales wrought so manye great myracles. One Dubtacus an Irysh man begate holy saynt Brigide of his mayde seruaunt called Brocsech,brigida. euē vnderuech hys wyues nose to spyght her wyth it, which had so many reuelacyon from heauen, and so many popes pardons from Rome. Saynt Cuthbert the great God,cuthbert of the Northe, and he that was wonte to defende vs from the Scottes, was a misbegotten also, for his mother was vnmarried. And his father in Irelande to haue the good occupieng of her, slewe both

her father and mother. These were the spirituall beginninges of the Sayntes of that age. If ye beleue not me, loke Iohan Capgraue in Catalpgo sanctorum Angliae.,Capgraue. and he shall tell ye much more of the matter. I coude shew yow many more yet of such holy sayntes birthes, but lete these for this time suffise.

The spirituall Sodomites and knaues hath not bene ashamed to write it in the liues and lieng legendes of al these, that is to saye of Dubricius, Dauid, Kinedus, Kentigerne, Cuthberth, and Brigide, with soche like, and solempnely so to reade and sing it as Gods seruyce in their temples,Their Gods seruyce. that they were sanctifyed in their mothers wombes. Se what aduauncementes they haue for stynking whoredome, and how litle deuocion to chast marriage instituted of God. Neuer were the sonnes of Abraham, Isaac and Iacob, of Moyses, Eleazar, and Phinees, so paynted out with miracles and wonders, nor yet so pranked vp with tabernacles and lightes, sensinges and massinges, as these whoresbirdes. Thus iudge they whoredom holynesse, &amp; wholsome mariage sinne.

But alac that fredome contynued not long wyth them, as ye shall wele perceyue hereafter Then dyd Augustine get him into Fraunce agayn, and caused one Etherius than Archebyshop of Arelas,Etheriꝰ. to consecrate hym the great byshop of all Englande, without eleccion or consent of the people that we reade of.

                     ¶ Their preparacions for Antichrist.
                     THe fyrst stody of these fathers after they were ones satled,primitie. was al about masse offerynges, ceremonies, byshoppes seates, consecrations, churche hallowynges, orders geuynge, tythes, personages, puryfycacions of women, and suche lyke. Wherupon a Synuode was called,Synodꝰ and there cōmaundementes were geuen that all thynges should be here obserued according to the customes of Rome. In Englande was there afore their commynge a Christiaanite,Christyanytye. but it was all without masses, and in a maner without choyce of eyther dayes or meates. The Brytaynes in those dayes had none other Gods seruice but the Gospell.Brytaynes. Seldome admytted they any difference of tymes with the Iewes, eyther anye Idoll sacryfyces wyth the Gentyles, but folowed the playne rules of the scriptures. If any supersticions were amonge their Monkes, they had nought to do therewith, but were euermore at lyberte. For Prynces at that tyme were not yet becomē the beastes Images,Princes to speake out of their spretes, or to make lawes accordynge to theyr lustes. The labour of Augustyne with his monkes,

from the forsayd yeare of our Lorde DC.600. was to prepare Antichrist a seate here in Englande, agaynst the full tyme or his perfyght age, of 666.666. For though he were fyrst conceyued in the wycked churche of Cain, yet could he not shewe hym self in his owne lykenesse, that is to saye, Christes opē aduersary, tyll Christ came in the fleshe. And then he apeared at all one tyme with hym,Antichrist. in the malygnaunt churche of the Iewes or spyrytualte of Herode, whiche then fyrst began to persecute hym and to seke hys death.

DC. &amp; ii.602. helde Augustyne an other counsell in the west part and countye of worcestre,Synodꝰ in a place that is yet called Augustynes oke, wherunto he called by cōmaundement, the. vij. bishoppes of the Brytayne churche with their principall doctours. And as they were takynge their iournay thydreward, they counsayled with a certayn solytarye man,Solynarye man which was knowē to be of a most perfight christen lyfe, what was to be done concernynge the aforesayed Augustyne. Anone he made them this christen aunswere: If he be a man of God (sayeth he) in anye wyse folowe hys counsayll. If he be not vtterlye refuse it. Howe shalll

we know that? saye they. Ye shall well perceyue it by hys gentyll sprete, sayeth he agayne. For Christ bad his scolers to learne of him to be meke harted.Christen counsell. If he be of that sort, he is lyke to brynge ye none other then Christes moste easy yoke. But if ye fynde hym proude, be ware of the importable burdens of the hygh mynded Pharysees. And as they were commen thydre,A proud Monke. they founde hym syttynge a loft in a throne of hygh honoure, shewyng vnto them no countenaunce of gentylnesse. Wherfore they regarded hym not, but vtterlye withstode all hys enforcementes.

                     AFter longe disputacions and other weywarde wrangelynges, he layed vnto their charges, that they were in many thynges, contrarye to the vnyuersall Christen churche. Notwithstanding, if they wold consent vnto hym in these. iij. poyntes.Thre poyntes That is to saye, to baptyse after the Romysh maner, to celebrate the feast of Easter as they do there and preache to the Englyshe Saxons as he should appoynte them, he would wel beare with them in all other causes. In no case would they graunte vnto hym, nor yet accept him for their archebyshop but sayd playnelye, they would styl hold

their auncient tradicions, whiche they perfyghtlye knewe to be agreable to the holy Apostles doctryne.A tyraūt Then sayd Augustyne furyouslye vnto them, that if they would not peaceably graunt to hys requestes, they should be enforced therō

And so in the yeare next folowynge, were slayne of their preachers by Augustynes procurement,A murtherer. to the nombre of a thousande and ij. hondred, with their great mastre Dionothus.

For in their argumentaciōs about that matter, they layde alwayes for them selues the vsages of that churche receyued fyrst of Iohan the Euangelyst, Philyp the Apostle, Policarpus, Traseas, Sagaris, Papirius and Meliton, allegynge the saynges of Policrates, and Eusebius, in that behalfe.Englysh churche. The churche that Avgustyne than planted in Englande, was more gouerned by byshoppes polycyes for their aduaūtage, then by ye expresse word of God to hys honour, as it hath bene euer sens. And therfore it was and is yet in outwarde obseruaciōs, rather a polytique churche then a Christen churche, the Iewyshe and Heythnyshe supersticions not rekened.

                     FOr so much as Rome hath bene so synnefull a synke and pernicyouse puddell, as hath all the worlde infected by the sodometrouse vowe of their symulate chastyte, necessary I thynke it in thys preface of the seconde part of my Englysh votaryes,ij. part. to shewe what foundacyon it hath had in the same. Xenophon sayth in hys boke of huntyng, that Rhoma is the name of a dogge, &amp; Iohan Textor affirmeth the same both in hys Epithetes &amp; Officines. A dogge in the scripture is iudged a beast most vyle,A dogge hys pryce beyng all one wyth the rewarde or wages of an whore for her whoredome. Thou shalt (sayth the lord to Moses) neyther brynge the hyre of an whore, nor the pryce of a dogge into the house of God in no maner of vowe, for both of them are abhominacyon vnto the Lorde thy God,False teachers Deuter. xxiij. They in the scriptures of the sacred Bible, are compared vnto dogges, whych both professe and teache the verite of God vnpurely, snarynge the symple sowles wyth the vnprofytable tradycyons of men synnefull.

                  ¶ In the Bible text, S. Hierome sayth, that Roma was the wyfe of Nahor Abrahams brother.Nahor. Gene. xxij. Whose chyldren were afterward, obseruers of the Planetes and so bycame Idolaters, after the mynde of Philo and other olde wryters. Cechim the sonne of Iauan,Cechim. Genesis. x. otherwyse called Italus, had a doughter named Roma, as testyfyeth Berosus the Chaldean, Fabius Pictor, &amp; Caius Sempronius, whom he constitute quene of the Aborygenes or people of an vnknowne begynnynge. Whych quene first buylded the great cytie so named, Whom after longe tracte of tyme Romulus most gorgyously fynyshed.
                        Romulus.
                      Thys mencyoneth also Paulus Constantinus, Christianus Massaeus, and Ioannes Functius in their Chronolagies, besydes that Ioannes Annius ded therin afore them. Now lete vs consydre how lady Lecherie the virgynall Goddesse of the Sodomyticall Papistes, hath compassed in, thys great cytie on euery syde with her fleshly fylthynesse. And fyrst let vs begynne with

Romulus and Remus, the first setters vp or aduauncers therof. These. ij. bloudy bretherne had an whore to their mother, called Rhea ilia,
                     
                        Ilia Rhea
                      whych beynge a professed nonne to Venus, committed whoredome both wayes, that is to saye, both in sowle and in bodye. For vndre the vowe of chastyte she serued the ydolles, as the maner was that tyme, and so dallyed besydes in the darke, as was well perceyued by her game.
                  ¶After the myndes of Virgil, Ouide, and such other fabulouse Poetes, these. ij. cruell captaynes Romulus and Remus, receyued their first nurryshment of a she wolffe whom they sucked, in sygnyfycacyon of the wonderfull tyranny whych shuld folowe in yt great cytie Rome, wherof they were the fyrst amplyfyers. Other authours report, that they were first nourced of an harlot called Lupa,
                     
                        Lupa.
                      not farre frō the floude of Tyber, where as the Romish Pope holdeth now hys palace, of whome all brothel houses, stewes, or places where suche fylthynesse is wrought, haue their names, and are called to thys houre Lupanaria.
                     
                        Lupanaria.
                      Romulus thus preserued by a thefe called Paustulus, nurryshed by a wolfe, and brought vp by an whore, gyuē also of him selfe to outragyouse lecherie, couetyse, and ambycyon, bycame suche a traytour to his owne stocke, as in the ende most cruelly

slewe hys naturall brother Remus, to establysh hys great buylded cytie in the wyckednesse of cursed Cain. Marke for thys storye Titus Liuius, Plutarchus, Bedas, and Iohan Boccatius. Chloris otherwyse called Flora,Chloris. a most notable harlot, obtaynynge infynyte ryches by her execrable whoredome, made Rome her heyer and the only inheritour of her fylthy possessyons, execrated of God, Deuter. xxiij. For the whych the Romanes admytted her for a great Goddesse, and dedycated vnto her ones in the yeare in Apryle, certayne feastes, called Floralia sacra.
                     
                        Floralia.
                      Thys hath Marcus Cicero, whych calleth her the mother of the Romanes, so hath Aulus Gellius, and Iohan Textor.
                  ¶Of these autoryte amonge these Romanes were there many, both consuls and senatours, whych were named by thys vncomly worde Spurius,
                     Spurij. signifyēge a bastard, as is to be seane in the chronycles of Eusebius, and Paulus Constantinus, by Spurius Verginius, Spurius Tarpeius, Spurius Carbilius, Spurius Posthumus, Spurius Scruilius, Spurius Largus, Spurius Cassius, Spurius Nautius, Spurius Medullinus, Spurius Vectius, Spurius Furinus, Spurius Herminius, Spurius Paulus, Spurius Oppius, Spurius Crassus, &amp; a great sort more. By thys shuld it seme that vnchast liuing was not only vnpōnyshed: but also aduaū
                     ced to great honoure amōg the Romanes.

Yet was he so deifyed of the Romanes, that he both became the God of theyr gardenes,A God. and had hys feastfull dayes euery yeare wyth solempnyte obserued, a garlande of floures sett vpon hys heade, and an he asse alwayes offered in sacryfyce to hym.

                     IN the seconde yeare after a thousande from Christes incarnacyon, the electours of the Emprour were appoynted.Electours. 1002. vij. for that great Antichristes commodyte, hys confirmacyon, othe, and coronacyon alwayes reserued to his owne precyouse fatherhede. Of these. vij. electours, thre were archebyshoppes, thre wer temporall prynces, &amp; the last was a kynge. The archebyshop of Magunce ouer all

Germany, the archebyshop of Tryere ouer all Fraunce, and the archbyshop of Coleyne ouer all Italy, were constytuted hygh chauncellers of the Empyre,Chauncellers. as watche men to take hede, least any thynge shuld in those quarters passe to the holy fathers dyshonour. The marques of Brandenburg was ordayned chamberlayne, the duke of Saxon, the swerde bearer,Princes and the Palatyne of Rhene the chefe seruytour at the Emprours eleccyon, with cuppe, keye, and swerde afterwarde to dyspatche hym (as hath bene seane) if he were not to holy church profytable. The kynge of Beme beynge butler, cometh in last of all as an arbiter or vmpere, if they can not agre to their spirituall behoue. After that,Pyllars foure dukes, four marquesses, four landgraues, four burgraues, four earles, four barons, four fre lordes, foure knyghtes, four cyties, four borowes, and four carles were appoynted as stronge myghty buttrasses to assist this newe ordynaunce. Martinus Carsulanus in chronico, Ringmannus Philesius in praefato opere, &amp; Rodolphus Gualtherus in Homilia ij. de antichristo. By thys occasyon (sayth Wyllyam Caxton in hys Englysh Cronicle, Par. vi.) the Egle lost many fethers,The Egle. and in the ende shall be left all naked.
                  
                  
                     ☞ Masse, Purgatory, and musycke.
                     
                        ABout thys tyme (sayth Iohan Wycleue) beganne the heresy of the consecrate host, or brede God of the Papistes, wherby they sought the vtter destruccyon of faythe, by settynge vp of a most parelouse ydoll of their owne makinge,An ydol in ye place of Iesus Christ our sauer and redemer. Whych heresy anon after Berengarius Turonensis by the word of God most strongely wythstode, so ded one Bruno the byshop of Angew, and VValeranus the byshop of Medburg, which were men of most excellent lyfe and learnyng, as their very enemyes witnesseth, Hildebertus Cenomanensis, Thomas VValden, and Ioannes Tritemius. Odilo the abbot of Cluniake,
                           Odilo abbas. 1010. practysed about the same very tyme, by helpe of ij. most crafty knaues an anker and a pylgryme, to delyuer sowles by Masses and diryges, from the terryble tormentes of a flamynge purgatory,Purgatory. whom they had conceyued by S. Gregoryes dyaloges and by the boylynge mounte of Ethna in the lande of Cycyle. Thys Odilo procured of Pope Iohan the xix. the commemoracyon of sowles to be celebrated in the church, the next daye after the feast of all sayntes. Ranulphus Cestrensis, li. vi. ca. xv. &amp; Petrus Equilinus. Osbernus a monke of Canterbury,
                           Osbernus 1010. whych had bene famylyar with Dunstane, practysed newe poyntes of musyck, and hys example in

Italy folowed Guido Aretinus, to make the veneracyon of ydolles more pleasaunte. Guilhelmus Malmesburiensis, Vincentius, &amp; Tritemius. Thus beganne the hypocresye of Lecherouse monkes and prestes,Hypocresy. to abuse the symplycyte of the ignoraunt people, and strongely to confounde theyr Christen beleue by tryfelynge superstycyons and ceremonyes. Anone after ded they adde the crafty inuencyons of profane phylosophers, that they myght the more wyttely deceyue the playne sort,Phylosophy. and the more craftely depraue the holy scriptures.
                  
                  
                     ☞A prest and hys louely doughter.
                     ALl thynges in the Papacy and empyre to their carnall commodyte thus dysposed, the Romysh clergy satled themselues all the worlde ouer, in ye abundaunt pleasurs of Sodome,Sodome whych were (as the prophete rehearceth) pryde, plenty of feadynge, solacyouse pastymes, ydelnesse, and crueltie, Ezech. xvi. Gyuen were they to lascyuyouse lustes and most prodygyouse occupyenges in the fleshe, burnynge in aduoutry (for contempt of marryage) as it were an ouen that the baker heateth. Osee. vij. Marke our Englyshe hystoryes in confyrmacyon of the same. For aboute thys tyme (Iohan Capgraue sayth, in catalogo sanctorū Angliae) a

deuoute holy prest (an ydell kneane yow wyll saye) went fourth euery mornynge into hys churche yearde,A prest 1010. and hallowed the granes there, with the. vij. Psalmes &amp; the Letany for all Christen sowles. On a tyme thys prest founde a mayde chylde a

As thys wēche ones grewe to conuenyent age,A wēche her bewtie so tā
                        gled his fleshely harte, that he vnfacyably brent in her concupiscens. And as he on a daye had cowched her naked in his bedde, anon he remembred his chast vowe (they saye) and so turned hys face to the dore, dysmembrynge hymselfe with a sharpe cuttle in her presence. And so throwynge fourth that trashe whych tempted him (if the legende be true) at the last he made her an holy vowesse &amp; veyled nonne to serue the spiritualte. Thys acte of prestish maydenhede, was dysclosed first in Irelande by a parlement of deuyls,Deuyls within the garden of an olde father Hermyte, not farre from S. Partrykes purgatory, where as they shewed themselues sore greued with this prest, for redemynge sowles by latyne Psalmes, out of their darke dominiō, Loke Iohan Capgraue postuitam Vu

Afterwarde thys man, whan he se hys tyme,As a wyfe, toke her out agayne, and kept her in howse with hym.

Much a do had her father and mother, cōfessour and abbesse (Mathew Paris sayth) to perswade her to thys marryage, and to obtayne her consent in the ende, by reason of her former professyon and vowe. Yet cursed she the fruite that shulde come of her body,Yll chaūge. whyche afterward turned her chyldren to great mysfortune (Polydorus sayth) for therupon were her two sonnes Wyllyam and Richarde drowned in the sea, and her doughter Maude the empresse an infortunate mother in bryngynge forth Henry the seconde, whyche put vnto death holy Thomas Becket.

Ye knowe what a nephewe is by the rules of Rome, whose fotesteppes the fathers most studyously folowed in that age as naturall subiectes

Ranulphe, &amp; Roger of Chestre saith) which was a man as the commen same went, gyuen all to lecherouse lyghtnesse &amp; to sorcerouse witchcraftes. For whan he on a tyme was foūd dead in an herber, a boke of curiouse artes was foūd vndre his pyllowe, made by Iulius Firmicus, whom he vsed to reade to himelfe in the none tyde. For ye whych his owne clergye wold scarsely suffer hym to be buryed wtout the church vndre tyrfes or soddes of the grasse.

For afore that tyme, they ded all without their consent, whyche they afterwardes founde not in all poyntes to their myndes commodyouse. No women were from thens fourth permytted to dwell in howse with them,Women sauynge only they whyche were so nygh of kynne as they myght not marry wyth (though they laye with some of them at tymes) as mother, syster, grandame, aunte, and suche lyke. Vtterly was it forbydden them euer after to haue any talke with them that had bene their wyues, vnlesse it were in the open stretes before two able witnesses.

He vtterly forbad hym the pastorall cure, tyll suche tyme as he had submytted hymselfe to hys Papacye, and professed a canonycall obedyence, whyche he called a submyssyon to the churche of Canterbury.

At this great counsell (sayth Ricardus Premonstratensis) were all the bishoppes of England, except. iiij. whych dyed, as it chaunced, ye same yeare, that is to saye, of Wynchester Durham, Chestre and Herforde. Their processe was all agaynst the cocasses or she cookes of ye curates,Processe that they shuld not dwell in house with them. For after the prestes had bene compelled to renounce the tytles of their wyues, they kept them in most places vndre the name of their cocasses, lawnders, and seruyng women. The kyng perceyuyng the malyce of the bishoppes, and seynge aduauntage to growe therupon,Lucre. by thys propre polycye deceyued them. He toke vpon hym the correction of them, and promysed to execute true iustyce. But in the ende (Mathew Paris sayth) he laughed them all to scorne, and takyng a pensyon of the prestes, he permytted them styl peaceably to holde their wyues. Polydorus reporteth, that the kynge gote of the

clergye thys autoryte ouer the prestes, by a fyne craft of conueyaunce.A craft. And whan he had so done, mysused it. A very fyne iudgement of a man learned, so to dyffyne of a prynces power.

For whan they had ones vncircumspectly graunted hym to execute iustyce vpon the prestes wyues,Wyues it turned in the ende to their rebuke and shame, the prestes for moneye set agayne at lyberte for them.

M. a.C. and. lxxi.1171. after. vi yeares exyle, he outragiously troubled certen of the byshoppes, to the kynges great dyshonour. Mathewe Parys sayth. For the only cause why he so hatefullye persecuted them, was, for that they hadde fulfylled the kynges desyre, in anoyntynge his sonne Henry ye yongar to raygne after hym, not hauynge hys consente beynge pope of Englande. For thys he entered the pulpet, more lyke a mad Bedlem thā a sober preacher.franrick Not to teache Chryste in mekenesse, but in hys wode furye to execrate those byshoppes, to curse thē wyth boke, belle, and candell, and by the popes autoryte to condempne them to helle. Vpon thys the kynges seruauntes fell on hym, in purpose (as they toke it) to reuenge their liege lordes great iniury, and hys sonnes dyshonoure. They pared his pylde crowne wyth theyr swerdes, and cut of the popes marke to hys very braiue whyls he in ydolatry cōmended himselfe and the cause of hys churche,Idolatrye. to hys patrone S.

                     OF Christe and of all hys Apostles and prophetes, are not written so many great miracles,Miracles. as of this one Becket. As that so many sycke, so many blynde, so many bleare eyed, bedred, croked, broused, mangled, lamed, drowned, palseyd, leprosed, sorowful, exyled, wyth chylde, enprysoned, hauged, and

deade, were by them as by him deliuered. Neyther were there euer so many writers of any popyshe saintes lyfe, or so manye great volumes made as of hys, as is shewed afore. And all thys was to blemyshe the kynge,Bokes. and to depresse the hygh power both in hym and in all his successours kinges after him. In the thyrd yeare after his deathe,1173. was he proclamed a saynt by the popes autoritie, and his daye triumphasitly celebrated ouer all Englande, hys masse beginnynge with Gaudeamus. The king came in all naked, sauynge that he hadde a liuen breche about hys nether partes. He receyued of the monkes a discipline wyth roddes, and was so absolued of them in theyr chaptre howse.Assoiled He resygned his power vpon their hygh aultre, consented to their vsurped lybertees, and professed him selfe a perpetuall subiect to Antichrist and the serpent, Apo. xiij. O blasphemers of God, and shamelesse mockers of men. But Cesarius sayth in the. viij. boke of hys dyaloges. ca. lxix. that in the. xlvij. yeare after hys deathe,1220. a questyon was moued in ye open scholes at Parys, whether he were saued or dampned.

Antichrist (sayth he) is already borne in the cytie of Rome, and wyll set hym selfe yet hyghar in the seat Apostolycke.Antichrist. I thought (sayd ye king) that he shuld haue bene borne in Antyoche or in Babylon, and to haue comen of the

Not so (sayth Ioachim) but as the apostle reporteth,Ioachim. he is that onely aduersary whyche extolleth hymself aboue all that is called God. For where as the lorde is called but holye, he is called the most holy father. Thus Antichrist shall be opened, and him shall God destroye with the sprete of hys mouth, and lyghte of his commynge.

But the paganes thoughte of the monkes, as the truth was, that vndre that colour of religion they were filthie buggerars. And so the

Chefely that he hadde builded a chapell at Lambeth, to the horryble preiudyce of the mother churche of Canterbury, placynge prestes or secular canons therin, and appoyntynge them lyuynges oute of theyr yearlye rentes to theyr vtter vndoynge. For there he intended (they sayed) to consecrate byshoppes,cōsecrat and to depryue them of theyr eleccyons, contrarye to their auncyent customes. So that they much feared that the dygnyte of there churche, whyche alwayes had bene a true handemayde to the church of Rome, shuld haue bene trāslated to that chapel Apostatrice, as they thā called it ful wisely. Thus was the archebishop at ye last cōpelled, as was Baldewin his predecessour,Baldewyn. to stryke it downe flat to the grounde, whome after lyke forte they had also vexed for buylding the like at Canterbury. Neyther was the kynge nor yet all the realme, at that daye able to staye them. Raufe Cogeshale sayth. For they feared therby also to haue lost their prerogatyue in chosinge alwaies

                     THus haue I broughte to an rude, the seconde part of the actes of my Englysh votaryes,Actes. whych is a contynuacion of them for. CC. yeares space, from Sathans comming fourth frō the bottomlesse pytt. Apocal. xx. after the full thousand of yeares from Christes incarnacyon, to the reigne of kynge Iohan in the yeare of our lorde a M. and. CC. If it be marueyled of,Yeares. that the first part shuld be so short, contaynynge so many yeares, and this part so longe of so fewe yeares, I desyre them that so maruayle, to take this for a full reason therof. He that is in pryson, can not buylde so fast to hys contentacion, as he that is abrode and at lyberte. I tolde ye afore, that Sathan was tyed vp for the tyme.Sathan. Not from doynge of myschefe, for

                     hat hath he wrought in all ages of the world. But he was sequestred from doynge thys greatest mischefe of all, in the Christen churche, for their vnthankefull receyuynge of the Gospell of saluacyon, whyche had professed the same. Whan Noe by hys preachynge, had admonyshed the people longe afore, of the floude,

that was commynge, if they repēted not theyr synnes, it layserlye came forwarde. But whan it was ones entered, than was there no stoppe but in it flowed apace.no stop. In lyke case was it wyth thys floude of darkenesse and beastlye ignoraunce, prescrybed of S. Iohan the Euangelyste, at the tyme appoynted, it fell faste vpon them that were drowned therin for theyr vnbeleues sake.

Suche craftye colours and deceyuable mystes,Mistes. were caste vpon them, by Sathans subtyle sophisters and sorcerouse dyuynes. Thus were they seane, wondered at, worshipped, and had in greate honoure for that. v. hondred yeares space, but not knowne a ryghte, for lacke of godlye dyscressyon and knowledge of Gods wurde, wherby all spretes are discerned and proued. But now in this lattre age, by the lyghte of the lordes aperaunce they are bothe seane and knowne,Lighte what they are in dede. The wurdes of the

lordes owne mouthe in the sacred scriptures, hath declared and manifested them to be most filthy abhominacions in their best aparellynges. More copye of wryters in thys age than in anye other afore,Autour. is also a lyuely profe and declaracyon of the same. Therfor am I nowe compelled, ere I passe any further, to shewe in fewe wurdes the summarye contentes of the. iiij. partes of my votaryes actes, that my reader maye knowe the dyfference of them, by theyr diuerse groundes and argumentes.
                  In the fyrste parte, after longe engenderynge, bredynge, and brynynge, my votaryes haue rysen faste, by the craftye inuencyons of Idolatours. In the seconde parte, they haue buylded faste, by the wyttye practyses of a monkes and chanons. In the thyrde parte,iiij. paroes. shal they holde faste, by the busye calkynges of the. iiij. orders of fryres. And in the forte parte, shall they fall faste, by the myghtye assaultes of the preachers and wryters. The fyrste parte comprehendeth all the tyme from the worldes begynning to a full thousand yeares after Christes incarnacyon.cōtentes The seconde parte contayneth CC. yeares more, from yt thousand of yeares to ye reigne of king Iohā. the third part shall contynue for. CC. yeares after that, which is frō the enteraūce of king Iohā to

the reygne of kynge Henry the fort. And the last parte shall conclude wyth an hondred and fyftye yeares,The last whyche is from the fyrste yeare of kynge Henry the forte, to the lattre end of this present yeare from Christes incarnacyon a. M. D. and. l. or thys next after that, whyche is. li. Thus maye these. iij. bokes be knowne dyuerse,Diuerse the one from the other, by theyr diuerse titles, of fast rysyng, fast building, fast holding, and fast fallinge, though all they procede out of one only argument of Englysh votaryes.
                  He that shall wyth wysdome consydre in thys seconde part,Craftes. the wylye procedynges of these Babylon buylders, howe they pranked vp their stought sturdye Antychrist aboue God and hys Christe, he shal fynde that these were theyr chefe practyses of myschefe. They perceiued that God of hys infynyte wysdome had placed. ij. hygh admynystracyons in the christianite for the conseruacion therof, and that they were, the publyque autoryte of noble prynces, and the gracyouse office of godly preachers.ij. offices The one was for ye outward welthe of the bodye, the other for ye inward welth of the sowle. They thoughte, if these. ij. were not peruerted and poysened, they shulde neuer come to theyr full purpose. Wherfore they sought firste of all to bring them vndre by sophistycall sorceryes.the firste And

fyrste they began with the weaker concernynge the worlde, whyche were the curates, preachers, or ministers of Gods wurd for they were (as apered) the more easie to ouercome. Christe the sonne of God, the holye Apostles, and the godly fathers of the primatiue churche, vpon diuerse consideracions, permitted them to haue wiues.Wiues. S. Paule most earnestly wrote it both to Timothe and Titus; that it shuld stande as a buildinge vnremoueable. Oportet episcopū irreprehensibilem esse,

                  If this wiuinge (thought they) might be brought to an yll opinion, that the people might treckē it nought, thā shuld we make that office of pastorall cure,Wretches. whiche afore serued God in paineful study of his wurd to serue vs in all vanitees and plesures of the fleshe. To bryng this to good passe, we must pretende a perpetuall chastyte. We must outwardly professe neuer to towche a womā,women. what so euer we do els in yt dark By thys shal we haue these commoditees We shall apere more holie than other people. We shal haue the preachers obedient to our affectes. They shall not rebuke our horryble darke doynges by the Gospell. No, for they shall for wante of women, haue vncomelye lustes in theyr hartes,

wherby they wyll be gyuen ouer of God to themselues. So shall they become buggerers and whoremaisters.Buggerers Yea, and suche blynde bussardes and beastes, as wyll be able to abyde no truthe. So shall our wyckednesse in the syght of people, become a lyfe of perfectyon and holynesse. By these chefely and by other lyke practyses, came that admynystracyon for the sowles behoue, to an vtter decaye and ruyne, as is shewed at large in thys former boke.

They first toke from kynges the inuestynge of prelates, or the power of admyttynge them to spirytuall offyces. They made the great prynces beleue, that they were but laye men, and myghte not intermedle in spirituall causes, or in the appoyntynge of the ecclesyastycall funccyons. Se here, how one myschefe grewe vpon another,Deceyt. as yt ouerthrowe of Christen princes autoryte, vpon

the condempnacyon of prestes marryage.

Where founde these execrable hypocrytes, that it was euer synne a man to touche that vessell whych was sanctifyed to his vse? Eyther yet, where was power graunted to their buggerysh generacyon, to make Christes bobye? O deuyls merydyane,Mockers. as the Prophete doth call yow, whan wyll ye leaue to illude both God and man? But to conclude. By this meane, at the last they had their full purpose, and therby made the Christen prynces to become their slaues, Yea, to holde their stiroppes with cappe in hande, to kysse their fylthie fete, &amp; to leade their mules and their horses.
                  Yea, they played with those worldly rulers, for all their great power and wysdome,Traytours. as the bearwardes do with their apes and their beares. They led them in the cheaues of their iniquyte, and compelled them at tymes, to do suche feates as they appoynted thē. Moreouer whan they wolde not obeye to theyr myndes, they feared them with the whyppe. They terryfyed them with their blacke curses.Curses. They fraybugged thē with the thundreboltes of

theyr excommunycacyons and interdiccyons, and threttened to set all other nacions vpon them. But our noble kyng Edward, and hys valeaunt father kinge Henry afor hym, threwe of from theyr shulders, the execrable yoke of those obstinate infidels. Neyther nedeth he to feare, to treade styll vndre hys fete that odyouse hydre and his singe serpent of Rome.An hidre For the eternall God, whiche hath giuen to him the power of a king, is strongar than is Sathan their great maistre.
