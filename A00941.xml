            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

To the vnlearned I doe likewise offer it, as sufficient furniture to arme and enable them against ignoraunce, the aduersarie and sworne enimie of vnderstanding: so that, from the communicating of this necessarie labour, a double benefite doth spring: namely, pleasure and profite: pleasure to the learned, whome if I had not made partakers of the same, I had shewed my selfe imurious: and profite to the vnlearned▪ to whome if I had denied the fruite of this my trauèll, they might well thinke and take me to be hatefull and enuious▪ Beeing carefull therefore of the one, and not negligent of the other, I am well content, that the commoditie of my labour, (which the learned lead by integritie and vprightnesse of iudgement, can but allowe▪ and the vnlearned, by cause on the vse thereof, d

To conclude, many, and (in manner) innumerable are the benefites which this booke bringeth, which we wish no lesse profitable to thee the Reader, then it was pleasaunt to me the gatherer &amp; translator.

                  This Epistle is tempered with iesting and pleasantnesse. One thing therin is serious, namely where hee giueth thankes to Lentulus, to whose gouernement Cilicia was committed: lastly, it conteineth certaine duti

I know no cause to the contrarie: Especially sithence in these dayes and as the course of the world nowe is, boldenesse may be vsed for wisedome, impudencie taken for prudence. I haue thanked Lentulus by my letters in your name, and that with diligence. But I would wishe you to looke for no more letters from vs: but rather to take paines to come and sée vs your friendes, and there to make your aboade, where you may growe in worship and estimation, rather then to continue where you are, séeming solitarie wise: albeit some which haue béene with you, report you to be proude and hautie

                  THE ARGVMENT.
                  This Epistle hath foure members, or portions. In the first Cicero being accused of Curio for his seldome writing, excuseth him self by the commemoration of his duetie. In the second, he discouereth the griefe of his mynde conceiued through the absence of Curio, and his ioy on the otherside, for Curio his worship. In the thirde is contained an admonition to the deseruing of praise, and to the imbracing of vertue. In the fourth, hee commendeth to Curio the estate of his olde age, being fiftie sixe yeares olde when he wrote this letter.
               
               ALthough I am grieued, that for negligence sake you haue me in suspicion: An excuse with a testimonie of his beneuolence. yet my duetie to be accused of you, did not so muche moue me to be sorie, as the selfe same to be required, did incourage me to be merrie: especially, sithence I am not guiltie of that offence whiche is layde to my charge▪ And assuredly, in that you acknowledge a desire of my letters, therein you declare your selfe, not onely an approued friende vnto me, but also do testifie the swéetenesse of your loue.

But concerning letters, let this suffice: for I mistrust not, but that I shall serue you to your owne contentation with often writing, conditionally, that my labour therein employed, be rather regarded, then refused, accepted then despised. The second part of the Epistle. I am not a litle grieued for your long absence from vs, by the meanes whereof I suffer this inconuenience, that I laboure in the lacke of your most swéete and delightsome acquaintance: and yet I can not but reioyce, for that you haue obtained and wonne (as it were) the maisterie in all thinges, with great worship and renoune, and that fortune assenteth to my desires in all your affaires, suites &amp; businesse.

                  ¶ THE ARGVMENT.
                  Hee exhorteth Curio to seeke after praise, fearing, least whiles ciuil warres did spring, hee would decline from the seruice which hee did owe to the common wealth, and take part and confederacie with traiterous citizens.
               
               YOu are not ignoraunt Curio, that of letters there are Three kynd of Epistles or letters. sundry sortes, but of all other none so certaine as that one, whiche moueth vs to inuent matters necessarie, that thereby we might certifie suche as be absent, of that whiche they ought to k

                  owe, eyther pertaining to vs, or to them.
               Such kinde of letters it is néedlesse to looke for at my hands, sithence you haue as well writers, as reporters, of your domesticall and priuate businesse. As for my matters, I haue nothing newe whereof to giue you intelligence. Beside this, there are two other kinde of letters, which exhibite vnto me no small delectation, the one is familiar and pleasant: the other is weightie and earnest: of which twaine whether it best behoueth me to frame my style vnto, and apply my pen, I am altogether ignorant. Should I vse dalliance in inditing; and pleasantnesse in writing vnto you? Now certeinly I thinke him to be no citizen who setteth his mind vpon toying Bycause of the ciuil wars and contentions. in these tumultuous times. Should I write somewhat vnto you grauely, and disclose some matter of weight? what thing can there be, whereof Cicero can certifie his Curio more seriously, then of cases concerning the common wealth? and in this kinde of letters is my cause conuersant, and so conuersant, that I would not willingly communicate with you, those thinges whiche at this present occupie my mynde. For in so doing I should busie my braine, in matters more hatefull then healthfull. Wherefore, bycause there remaineth vnto me no argument wherevpon to write, I wil vse that litle clause or petit sentence, which of custome I am wont, and I will not be behinde hand to incourage you to the desire and loue of renoune: for you haue a sore aduersarie,

and the hope which is alreadie had on your behalfe, excéedeth the boundes of all beliefe: which hope and expectation, you may satisfie, and easily ouercome by the meanes of one thing, namely, if you be certeinly resolued in this point, that earnest labour muste be susteined, and no paines auoyded, in Mening the morall vertues wherewith we win credite to our selues, and commoditie to the state of our countrie. those thinges principally which purchase passing prayse, both with Prince and people, the glory and fame whereof you haue singularly and throughly loued. Much more would I write tending to this same purpose, but that I am persuaded, that of your owne accorde you haue stomach sufficient in this point, and haue your mynde no lesse inflamed to deserue dignitie, then I am ready to put it into your memorie: and this, whatsoeuer it be, litle or much, that I haue touched in my letter, I haue not done, to the intent to kindle your courage the more in this case, but to the ende I might sende you an assuraunce of my loue, and a gage of my hartie goodwill.
               Fare you well.

                  He comforteth Curio mourning for the death of his father, and promiseth that he will be vnto him in place of a second father.
               
               I Haue lost a speciall witnesse of my great loue towardes you, your father I meane, a man of singular vertue and noblenesse: who, by the benefite of his owne praises, and by the meanes of you his true and naturall sonne, had excelled the fortune of all men whatsoeuer, had it béene his good lucke to haue had life prolonged, till such time as he might haue séene you, his valliant sonne, after your returne from the Ouer the which he had peremptoric gouernment, and iudiciall authoritie. prouince, before he gaue his last farewell to the world. But though he be gone, yet I rest in hope, that our friendship is not frustrate of witnesse sufficient. The Gods giue you good of your patrimonie and inheritaunce. I am yours, and thinke that you are no lesse loued and thought vpon, then

                  THE ARGVMENT.
                  He commendeth highly Titus Annius Milo, labouring for the Consulship and to the intent he might obteine that which he defireth, omitteth no one circumstance nor other, which in a commendatorie letter may be required.
               
               YOur comming to Italie The first wordes detect the desire of the Petitioner was not then hearde of, when I sent Sextus Villius, Miloes friend vnto you with these my letters: Howbeit, when there was an ynkling, that it wold not be long er you came, and that it was perfectly knowen, that you were iourneying out of Where Curio was in office of the Quaestor.

An insinuation, or close entrance, to his petition. If (friend Curio) my desarts towardes you were such, as they are more commended of you, then considered of me, I would, if I had any great petition to make, trie what I could obtaine, if Marke his modestie. shamefastnesse were not my hinderance. For, to a shamefast felow, it is grieuous and troublesome, to craue some great thing of him, of whome he thinketh him selfe by duetie Priuie commending of his merites. well to haue deserued, least the thing which he craueth, might seme to be In requiring is dutie, in defireing is desart. required, rather then desired, and to be counted a recompence and not a benefite. But bycause your merites towardes me are manifest vnto all men, and in the straū genesse of my doleful dayes, appeared, not onely in their brightnesse, but also in their greatnesse: and séeing It is the propertie of a gentle and courteous nature, to affoorde much vnto him, to whome much is due: I doubted not to craue that of you by letter, whiche of all thinges is to me the greatest,

and most necessarie. Neyther doe I feare any vnabilitie in bearing the burthen of your innumerable benefites, sithence chiefly I am of this confidence, Frō hope of making recō

I, my studies, al my labour, care, trauell, diligence: for end, all my mynde haue I founded, fastened, and fired vpon Milo his Consulship, wherin I haue determined, not onely to séeke for the commoditie of the office in his behalfe, but also as I ought, for the due praise of pietie. And surely, I thinke no man at any time hath béene so carefull of his health and wealth, as I haue béene of his renoune and honour: in the which I haue béene resolued, my self and all myne to consist. I knowe that you, being but one man, can, if you will, be to him such a furtheraunce and helpe, as ouer &amp; beside the same we néed demaund nothing.

And if one man among al yt rest, may be desired &amp; wished, to this roome of authoritie, vndoubtedly, we shoulde not picke out one, whome with you we might account comparable. Wherefore, if you can conceiue this opinion of me, that I am not a man vnmindfull of my friende, that I am disposed to courtesie and goodnesse, if there were none other cause of such conceit, then that I lay to my helping hand so earnestly, for Milo his furtherance, finally, if you are of this iudgement, that such benefites as you

haue bestowed on me, are not frustrate and cast away: then let me desire thus much of your gentlenesse, that you would stande my friend in this matter whereof I am carefull, that you would employ your trauel and paine for my commendation, or to tell a flat truth, in manner, my life and preseruation. As for T. Annius, thus muche I promise in his behalfe, that no man in the world toward you shall shewe more humanitie, more grauitie, more constancie, more beneuolence and goodwill, if it would please you to vouchsafe him your fauour. And as for my selfe, my worthinesse, honour, dignitie, and renowne, shall by your meanes so much be inlarged, as I must (perforce) acknowledge you to be the very same my benefactour, in the procurement of my praise, that wast sometime the pawne and protectour of When you spared no paines in restoring me to my natiue countrie. my life. But that I am assured, that it is not vnknowne to you, how seriously and earnestly I labour in this petition of Milo, and that therein not only great paines, but also some resistance and striuing is required, I would haue written vnto you more at length: And now I cōmit to your patronage the whole matter and the cause, and mine own person I commend to your courteste. And take this one clause for a conclusion, that if I may obteine at your handes the summe of my supplication, Milo shall not be so much bound vnto you for your highnesse, as I wil be your déepe debter for your goodnes. For the safegarde of mine owne life was not to me so precious, and déere, wherein he shewed him selfe a principall fauourer, as my thankfulnesse shall be pleasant and delectable, in making iust recompence, where vnto I shall be drawne by your onely &amp; alone friendship, as in hope I am persuaded.

I knowe you are no table patrones. These wordes import some matter of efficacie. He must be a manqueller that meaneth to commit his lyfe to your supportation, and the canuassing of his cause to your defence. But in this man no excuse is seruiceable, for I will take none. You shall set all thinges aside, if you loue me indéede, sithence my friend Fabius is willing to vse your aduise and help. I am in great expectation of the state of * things at Rome, and my desire to vnderstand of them is vehement and earnest: and first of all I would gladly knowe howe it fareth with you: For we haue heard no newes now this long time, bycause of the sharpnesse of the winter.

                  THE ARGVMENT.
                  Dolabella accused Appius, and at the selfe same time had married Ciceroes daughter. Cicero goeth about to proue that he was ignoraunt of that which his friendes had done in that case, and gathereth many reasons to the same purpose.

               For I manifestly perceiue thus much, that not your manhoode and substance only, but your wisedome and discretion also, are most necessarie and expedient, to make your enimies repent their vnaduised and ouer rash dealing.

And surely, sithence I sée the helps and assistance which you are like to haue, not onely auailable, but also innumerable, I can not doubt, but that this carefulnesse and courteous regard in your behalfe, is like to redound to your greater worship. If you bring to passe that Censors, that is, officers for the reformation of maners be made and ordeined, and if your behauiour and vsage in the same office be such, as it ought to be, and as you are of abilitie to perfourme: I sée none other likelyhoode, but that you shall in time be a great stay &amp; safegard, not to your self only, but to all yours, whiles the worlde indureth.

Whose fonde talke and childishe communication, was reported vnto me long since in writing, by our familiar friend M. Coelius: and whereof also you your selfe haue sent me word by letter. As for me, I had rather cut off all old acquaintance with him, who hath purchased your anger, then to séeke after newe friendship. Neither would I haue you call the loue and affection whiche I beare you, into question, for thereof you ought not to stand in doubt, sithence the same is not vnknown to any in the Prouince, nor vntestified in the citie of Rome. Neuerthelesse, so farre as I gather by the substance of your letters, a certaine kinde of suspicion is signified, and a doubt also secretly mencioned: in the disscussing wherof another time shalbe more conuenient, as well to reason with you too and fro in this behalfe, as also to purge and discharge my self in this case. For, where and in what place haue I béene an hinderaunce to any embassage, to the intent that it might not passe to Rome for the augmentation and inlargement of your praise and honour? Or if I had hated you with a professed spite, and a manifest enuie, wherein could I shewe the fruites of suche: a mischéefe, lesse to your harme and annoiaunce? Or if the enuie wherein I boyled against you were secret and priuie, wherin could I haue shew ed my selfe a more open and sworne aduersarie? And if so be any discredit, and want of honestie, had béen equal or semblable to theirs, which sprinckle vs with these blottes of blame, yet vndoubtedly, It is the point of folly to shew a will to hurte him, whom thou canst not for thy hart by any meanes, annoy. I would not haue swarued so farre wide from wisedome and discretion, either in hidden hate to practise open quarelling, or to bewray the inclination and pronenesse of my hart, to do him harme, whom to annoy is beyond

my reache and abilitie. I remember certaine came to mée, and saide, that the costes and expences whiche were appointed for the embassadours, were too large, and greater then they ought, wherein I vsed, not so muche the Very wittily spoken, because he regar deth friendship when hee cōmaundeth: and hath an cie to the law when hee valueth. libertie of commaunding, as I did the equitie of valuation, estéeming them as narrowly as I might, to the tenure and meaning of that lawe, named Lex Cornelia, in that respect prouiding.

                  He persuadeth Marcellus to abandon al counsel of exile and banishment, and to returne into his countrie: that Caesar is not against it: that his brother desireth it: that the common wealth looketh for it: that the state of his owne houshold and familie standeth in great neede of it.

The beginning of his persuasion is deriued from the proofe of Marcellus his vsage in the office of a good Citizen, wherein wanted no perfourmance. &amp;c. I remember very well, that you are the man, which behaued your selfe in the office of your Consulship, no lesse honourably, then vertuously, long before you sawe the sparckles of these enormities and maine mischiefes kindling: and this perceiued I also, that as well the counsel taken for making ciuil warres, and the hoast of Pomp

But if you are fully resolued, to liue rather in perpetuall absence, then to sée that which in no wise you would: From that which is necessarie. yet this ought to be fixed and setled in your cogitation, that in what plotte of land so euer your body abide, you are not exempted from his dominion, but subiect to the power of him, to whome by flight you deny subiection and allegiance: who of his singular clemencie and goodnes, though he should suffer you, now destitute of coūtry, &amp; frustrate of possessions, to liue as you list in peace &amp; quietnes: So that his exile is neither honest nor safe. yet ought you of dutie, to make this your cōtinual meditation, what a godly thing it is for you to lead your life rather at Rome in your owne house, then to be abroade in Mitylene, or in Rhodes.

               ALthough I gaue to Quinto Mucio, not many dayes ago, a letter written somewhat at large, to be deliuered to your owne hands, wherein I discouered my iudgement, how you ought to be affected in your owne case, and what for to doe were most conuenient, in my thinking: yet, when Theophilus, your fréeman, was prouiding to take his iourney vnto you, and I sufficiently perceiuing his faithfulnesse, and beneuolence towardes you, would in no wise, let him passe without any letter. Wherefore, I thinking it not impertinent to your present estate, aduertise you nowe as I haue done heretofore, not to neglect your owne commoditie, but to wil and to do your best, in that common welth (howsoeuer it be inclined) to be conuersant, from the which you are now absent.

one, as for my sake, put his owne life, landes, and goodes, in desperate hazarde: not fearing the penaltie of a The lawe of Clodius, whiche commaū

I woulde we were once able to make him amendes: we thanke him dayly, but that is no sufficient acquittaunce. We passed from Brundisium the fifth of the Calendes of Maie, and so tooke our voyage to Cyzicus by Macedonia. O miserable man, O tormented traueller: what shoulde I desire of you, poore woman, wasted in bodie, and consumed in mynde: to come and visite me? may I not desire so much? may I not see you? then, alas, muste I lacke you? nowe sure so I thinke: Then must I doe as I may. If there be any hope of our returne, doe what you can to confirme and to further it. But if there be none, as I suspect and feare, then are we vndone, and past hope of good spéede. Howbeit, doe what you can to come to me, and then be sure of this, that if I haue your companie, I wyll not thinke my selfe in despaire and past recouerie. But for our daughter Tulliola, what order shall we take? I referre that to your discretion: for I can in that case giue no counsell. Neuerthelesse, howe so euer the case standeth, regarde must be had, that her miserie be mitigated, her marriage not neglected, and her good name and fame well mainteined. And what shall Cicero my sonne doe? I am content that he lodge in my bosome, and be alwayes present within the compasse of myne imbracing body. More then I haue alreadie written, I can not comprehende: heauinesse hindereth, sorrowe will not suffer, care intercepteth, present griefe in no wise permitteth. Howe it fareth with you, I wote not, whether you possesse something, or (whereof I am sore afraide) whether you are spoyled and turned out of all things. I trauell in confidence, that Piso, as you write, will continue our friende and fauourer. Touching suche of our familie, whome I haue made frée and set at libertie, there remayneth no matter wherewith you should be moued. As

for those which abide with you, your promise was, that your dealing shoulde measure their deseruing. Orpheus remayneth still in seruice, and persisteth in his dutie: the rest are not so officious and attendaunt. The condition of the other seruaunts is such, that if wée bée quite dispossessed, they inioy fréedome and libertie, if they may obtaine it If by the meanes and procurement of Clodius they were not withstoode. without contradiction or deniall. And if wée bée not disherited, but kéepe our owne without diminution or empayring, that their seruice be at our cōmandement, a very few excepted. Howbeit, these are to be thought things of lesse weight, and tending to small purpose. Whereas you exhort me, to haue a good heart, and such a mynde, as the foggie and moyst mystes of miseries, may not infect and putrifie: and moreouer minister hope and confidence of restitution to my former worshippe and dignitie, with recouering of my sore shaken safetie: I wishe with all my heart, suche to bée the hope whiche you exhibite, that in hoping, I may not, as one vnhappie, hope amisse. Nowe, for my selfe (miserable man) when shall I receiue any letters from you? what messinger shall conuey them hether, and deliuer them to my hand? I had looked for them at Brundisium, but that the mariners woulde needes away, as loth to bée hindered by any tyde or tempest. It remaineth (my Terentia) that you mainteine your self, as you are not vnable.

                  ¶ THE ARGVMENT.
                  He commendeth Apollonius, sometime seruant to P. Crassus, to win him creadit with Caesar, then incamped in Spaine, and armed against the confederates of Pompeius.
               
               MY loue and liking of This Crassus was slaine of the Parthians, with his father M. Crassus. 
                  P. Crassus, a young man of excéeding noblenesse, hath béen no lesse faithful then feruent: in whome, whiles he was but in the floure of his age, I reposed such hope as kindled my comfort: and beganne also to conceiue of him as well as heart could thinke, vpon sundrie circumstances which offered them selues to my iudgement. With this Crassus sometime was Apollonius in seruice, of whome, whiles his maister liued, I made great account, and might in no wise disallow of his doings: for he was very circumspect &amp; studious in his masters businesse, &amp; a mā maruellous moete to serue his turne at al assayes: for y• which cause Crassus loued him accordingly. And now, since y• d

This Appolonius comming ouer vnto me at Cilicia, did affoorde me such seruice, that in many thinges I might not misse the necessarie vse of his assisting hande, nor be destitute of his wisedome, counsel and prouidence: and the self same man, as I thinke, withdrew not his will or might from you, at suche time as it was welcome, aduenturing to compasse as muche as his abilitie coulde permit, in the Alexandrine battell. Whiche seruice of his, ministring this hope vnto his heart, that your opinion concerning his person, and behauiour, would be no lesse commendable then oures▪ he determined with him selfe, to prepare direct passage * vnto you principally into Spaine, to the attempting also of which voyage, myne aduise was not wanting, for his further incouragement. To whome I would not haue applyed so plausible a style, in depainting out his praise, but that I was persuaded, that with you it shoulde loose none authoritie: Howbeit, I prayse him not, to this purpose, as though he had not deseru

And if he were disposed to craue commendation, and were addicted to heare the trumpe of mens tongues sounde his prayse, I perceiue whole multitudes applyaunt in that behalfe. As for the testimonie of myne owne priuate iudgement, whereof he accounted, not slenderly, and which I am assured of, shal preuaile thoroughly, I haue most willingly declared. I dare verifie, that the man is learned, and that he hath desired and de lighted in the best exercises of studie, which good inclination hath not sprong in him of late, but growne in him of long con tinuance, euer since he was a boy. For he lodged in my house, with Diodotus the Stoicall Philosopher, a man (in my iudgement,) very profound, and déepely experimented in matters of naturall secrecie, and other pointes of wisedome and grauitie: with whome hee did kéepe companie, not for

a fashion, but of a will, to waxe learned, and expert in that whereof he was ignoraunt: and being nowe inflamed with the admiration of your martiall exploites, and other serious affaires, is very desireous, to reduce them in a Chronicle, and to write them in the Gréeke tong, as a monument of your im mortall memorie. I doubt not but he is able to comprehend as much as he pretendeth, and that he can bring his enterprise, in that case, to perfection. He lacketh no learning: he lackes not experience: it is not long, since he was conuersant in the like kinde of knowledge and practise: very earnest is he, to satisfie the eternitie of your puisance, and by his pen to decypher your praises in perpetuall recordes: Now haue you a witnesse and testimonial of mine opinion touching Appollonius: of whom, I trust, you will according to the singularitie of your discretion, conceiue certaine iudgement: and therafter giue him a taste of your courtesie: And yet againe, I commend him vnto you, whereof I made a former denial, protesting, that in what respect soeuer it shall please you to be his fauourer and furtherer, I my self shal account it worthy double acceptation.
               Fare you well.

And although I perceiue, the profites which hereby I haue gotten to be but small, in comparison: yet am I not in doubt or despaire, neyther in lothsomnesse of labour, as ouerwearied and cloyed with such a busie charge, but am as ready and as venturous as euer I was, not only in the loue of libertie, but also in tempestes of dangers. Howbeit, if by the procurement of the Senate, and of each other notable personage, we may attaine some due and deserued honour: oure authoritie shall be inlarged with the rest, and our abilitie to profite the common wealth shal be increased. I could not sée your sonne, when I came to Brutus, bycause he was remoued and gone to kéepe his winter, with a troupe of horsemen. But that he is so affected towards the weale publique, both for your sake, and his owne, and principally for mine, I haue cause to reioyce: for he is to me in stead of a brother, as your true sonne, and worthy of such a father.

What if al yt I haue done séeme vnto you, not méete to be so popularly praysed? yet remember, that He which once runneth once out of the rayles of shamefastnesse, may throughly continue impudent.

For nothing is more meete to recreate the Reader, then the varieties of times, and the alterations of Fortune, which, although in cōsideratiō of experience they are not to be desiered: yet, in respect of perusing and reading, they are to be imbraced.

For that great Alexander was not carried away with a blinde affection, when he would haue none paint out the portraiture of his bodie, but Apelles, and none to make his image in metal, saue Licippus: but reason and iudgement bred that conceit in his minde, bycause he thought, that they being most excellent and incomparable artificers, should not only in the discouerie of their skill make him glorious, but them selues also passing famous. And those forenamed workmen of singular worthinesse, made such persons, by their pictures and sculptures most liuely proportioned, so far frō being strange, that they were well knowne to such as neuer sawe them: which thing, although they had not by cūning compassed: yet should

their noblenesse haue béene no whit the more darkned. Neyther is the renoune of that Spartane or Lacedaemonian Agesilaus, of lesse porte and account, for that hée suffered not the lineaments of his body to be drawne in colours, nor the fourme and measure of his members to be made in metall: then the fame and name of those, that were moste desierous both wayes to be popular. For that smal pamphlet of Xenophon, penned in the prayse of the same king, is of such sufficiencie, that it surpasseth all the pictures shadowed with the painters pencill, and all images of the caruer or grauer smothed and fined with his chosen instruments. And surely this shall séeme to me a thing of great excellencie, both to the delectation of my mynde, and also to the remembraunce of my dignitie, if I may be described by your pen, then portraied by their skil, or set out in the volumes of any other whatsoeuer: not only, for that you should in setting me out, giue a note of your rare wit and profound knowledge: as Timaeus did, in the behalfe of Timoleon: and Herodotus for the aduauncement of Themistocles: but bycause you by your authoritie and countenaunce, being a man of great acceptation, and in causes of weight very well knowne to the common wealth, may procure me the more renoune: that I do not only heare that sound of puisance and dexteritie, that blast I say of honor &amp; high worship, which Alexander when he entred into Sigeum, did say that Homer ascribed to Achilles: but that I may possesse and inioy that pension of prayse, which hath issue, not only from the testimonie of a man ofIt is not enough to doe notable feats, but an excellent writer is requisite also to record thē. great knowledge, learning, and grauitie, but also of honour, noblenesse, and authoritie. For Hector, whom the Poet Naeuius introduceth in his poesies, hath a plausible sentence, reioycing aboue measure, not only in that he was praised: but he addeth this clause as a necessarie supplement, bycause he was praysed of a man deseruing prayse. And if so be that, lucke lay a blocke in the way, that my request is in hassarde of hinderance (sithence it is no reason nor conscience, that you shoulde disapoint me in any thing wherein I desire your furtherance) I shal be constrained peraduēture, to attēpt that which many very scornfully

Yet I cannot but accuse your effeminacie and womanlike disposition, if you giue vs leaue frankly to vtter what we thinke. Will not you; hauing so eleare and sharpe a sight in the contemplation of thinges hid and secret, view &amp; beholde that which is sensible and manifest? will you knowe this, that you consume and waste your selfe with continuall

And if by persuading we preuaile not, but sée our labour lost, we be take vs to praying, and vse wayes of intreatance, beséeching you, that if you wil do any thing in the world for our sake, shake off this yoke of anguishe, cast away sorrowe, and returne, either to liue with vs among all your acquaintance,Either liue among vs, as you wer wont or at least liue merily alone. in our common conuersation: or else in solitarinesse to your priuate contentation.

               I Receyued two seuerall letters from you, tendinge to one effect, which was a manifest argument of your dilligence. For I perceiued, that you were touched with a certaine desire, to haue your letters, which I long looked for, deliuered to my hands. Out of which, after I had perused them, I reaped double commoditie and vauntage, very hard for mée in conference to decide by iudgement: whether I should thinke your loue towards my person, or your true hart to the body of the common wealth, of greater accompte and estimation. The loue and affection of oure countrie, in my iudgement, is the greatest without exception, but yet not withstanding, the knitting together of our wills conteyneth more It is true: but yet not more loue. for our countrie in that respect is preferred be fore oure parents and our children, ergo much more before oure friendes. swéetnesse: wherefore the commemoration of that beneuolence, and reuerence, which you exhi

Againe, the declaring of your mind and studie to the commonwealths aduauntage, which you haue alreadie conceiued, and hereafter meane also to sée continued, appeared vnto me passing pleasaunt. And so much the greater was this delight, how much the néerer it approched to the aboue recited circumstances. Wherefore, my Plancus, I doe not onely exhort but also beséech you, as I haue done in that my letter, whereunto you sent mée an answeare, that with all your heart, wil, and des

Howbeit In that part of his booke wherein hee doth cōmend Cicero. I stayed vp my selfe as well as I might: many things I impaired: many thinges I omitted: and many thinges were not so muche as once mencioned. As therfore it is seene in the climing steps and staues of long ladders, if some be takē away, some cut off and broken, other some left loose and vnfastened, it is made an instrument of falling downe, rather then of going vp: euen so, a desire of writing, encountered with many misfortunes, &amp; as it were torne to tatters with a thousand tempests of troubles, what thing can it affoorde, either in hearing delectable, or in iudgement probable? When I came to the noble name of Caesar, all my ioyntes quaked, and I trembled sore for feare, not for any terrour of punishment, Bycause he was doubtfull howe Caesar would take his doings, wel or yll. but for the vncertaintie of his opinion: for I am not so wel acquainted with him, that I should knowe his whole disposition. In what wauering is my mynde, suppose you, in what a maze of mistrust is my conscience, when it reasoneth with it selfe in this forme and order? This will Caesar allowe: This word offereth cause of suspicion: what if I change it? But I dout in so doing I shall set downe a worsse. Go to then, do I praise any? is that an offence? admit it be so taken, what if he wil not allowe the commendation. Or, he writeth to mee with weapon in hande: Or, hee writethe like a warriour fiercely to his onimie.

               TO that whiche was the last point and conclusion in your Epistle, I answere firste, and make it the beginning of my letter. For I haue marked and obserued, that you great Rhetoricians and famous Oratours, vsurpe the same order otherwhiles. You require my letters, which I neuer failed to send, whēsoeuer I was informed of any that made passage that way. In that I gather by the scope of your letters, that you wil not attempt, nor determine vpon any thing of a certaintie, before you had vnderstanding, howe farre foorth that felow (I wot not what he is) Caerilius Bassus wold presume:

my hope and confidence inclined that way, by reason of your policie which put me in comfort, &amp; the grauitie of your style in writing, which discharged me of despaire. My earnest request vnto you, is, that you would write as often as may be, to the intent that I may be resolued what you doe, &amp; what other do, and also what you are purposed hereafter to take in hand. And, although I was sorie at my hart for your departing from me: yet notwithstanding I restored my selfe with consolation at the same instant, both bicause I thought thus in my mind: He shal go where he shal be at peace, quietnesse, rest &amp; tranquillitie, &amp; shal be deliuered from matters of great importance, which desire present attendaunce: albeit the contrarie chaunced, in both respects.

But suche be the endes of ciuil warres and commotions, that those things only, which the conquerour wold, are not accomplished: but that their desi

                  Plancus, &amp; a hearer of Laberius &amp; Publius their poesies in Caesars shewes &amp; pageants. Knowe you thus much, that I stand in néede of nothing so much, as I do of one with whom I may haue familiar cōmunication, and learned laughter: &amp; you shal be the man, if you come quickly, which that you do, I thinke for me profitable, and for your selfe not incommodious.

Which if you doe, both Luc ceius &amp; Pompeius shall wel accept your courtesse, &amp; you shall leaue with them a principal pledg of your merits, thus much I auouch and do able.

But thus muche vnderstande you: your olde aduersaries, nowe your newe friendes, are not only vehemently astonished with your epistle, but being quite spoyled of the great affiance wherevnto they trusted, are vtterly discomforted. Concerning that letter, which was directed and sent vnto me, although therein but a bare argument and a naked signification of your will towardes me was comprehended: yet notwithstanding, that it was pleasaunt and delectable vnto me, I woulde not haue you ignoraunt. For euerie man doth, of custome, reioyce in nothing so much, as in the certaine and assured knowledge of his friendly seruice, and dutifull pointes of courtesie. So my conscience, in that respect, ministreth vnto me plentifull delectation.

So that now, our enemies being vanquished and vtterly put to flight, al hope in you is harboured, all confidence and assurance in your dealing reposed. For it is noysed abroad, that the most notable and principall ringleaders, of those rebellious robbers, and trayterous varlots, haue forsaken the foughten field, and being vnable, any longer to encounter, haue taken flight from Mutina. Therefore it is no lesse cōmodious to digge vp the rootes, then to cut off the small sprigs: and as commendable to pearce to the bone, as to pare the skinne: and as great puisaunce and prowesse, to take triall of the vttermost hazard, as of the formost aduenture: and as much praise due to constancie, to wounde him to the death, as to draw out a weapon.

Yet, hetherto, I haue not accomplished that point of courteous duetie: because I perceiued that woordes and sentences could not preuaile, against your pensifenesse, which was vnappeasable, nor diminish any part of the same, it was so indurable. In processe of time, when hope began to beare blossoms abundantly, that the day was approching, wherin we should haue the presence of your person, in health and prosperitie: I could no longer bridle the secrete motions of my mind, but néedes must declare vnto you my determination, &amp; discouer the whole summe of my counsell. I will therefore write that vnto you, whereof I haue a sealed warrant, namely, that the anger and displeasure of Caefar against you, will hereafter be assuaged. For, to tell the plaine truth, both the matter it selfe, the day, the opinion of people, and (as I gather by sundrie apparaunces) the inclination of his owne proper nature, allure him to gentlenes and clemencie: which to bée as I say, not onely the estate of other, ministreth mée occasion to presuppose, but the reports of his néerest friends, and Gentlemen he meaneth of Caesars neerest acquaintance, such in déede as with him are most familiar, persuade mée that you are towards the attainement of Grace with his highnesse.

                  Sextius, mine owne conscience is witnesse sufficient: and, in what reuerence I am bound of duetie to haue him, bothe you vnderstand, and no man can be ignorant. This Sextius, after he had béene certainely infourmed, by the reportes of many, that I was déepely in your fauour and friendshippe, requested me, to write vnto you, as earnestly and effectually, as was possible, touching the inheritances and possessions of C.

This C. Curtius hath a certaine possession, or péece of lande, lying in Volaterrano, wherto he conueyed the remnant of al his substance, as it were from the daunger of deuouring ship wracke.

Touching M. Bollanus, a man of no lesse honestie, then valiantnesse, a man (I say) furnished

If you wil vouchsafe for my sake, to bestowe some labour, that he may be apprehended, and sent backe againe to me his maister, what a benefite I shall receiue by your paines therein employed, I am not able, by vtteraunce, to testifie.

I demaund not of you, what your determinations be, touching his controuer sies: (you shall saue, as your credite and dignitie requireth, your statute and ordinaunce) but my petition vnto you, is, that he haue easie accesse to your person: that he may obtein those thinges, which are not repugnant to equitie, your will in no point withstanding: and that he may sée iust cause, and take euident proofe of my fréendshippe, how appliable it is to procure his profite, especially through you, with whome my woordes are not vnlikely to preuaile. Not to faile in this case, I beséeche you moste earnestly.

                  Agenor the Musician taught to play on melodious and tuneable instruments, besought me with instance, to be earnest with you by letter: that, sithence it hath pleased you to cal home againe a greate nūber out of exile, you would vouchsafe also, on him, his father, and brethren, be stow the same benefite of restitution. To whose demaund, or rather request, when I made this answere, that I should not only shew my selfe foolish and insipient, but also saucie and impudent, in labouring for the graunt of so great a grace, to magistrates with whō neuer before I had conference, nor yet acquaintaunce: they Or, were more earnest and instant with me, to graunt their re quest, that their friends might also be gratified. assaulted me with more serious supplications, not holding me (say what I could to auoide their intreatance) excusable. Now when they were frustrate of all confidence, &amp; readie to be (as it were) deuoured in despaire, it was manifest to all men, and maruelous apparant, that their minds were excéedingly molested, and tooke their repulse very vnpatiently. Nowe, when I perceiued, their perturbatours were more vehement, then was conuenient, at length yealding to their request, I made them promise, to write this Epistle, &amp; to sée it sent vnto you also, for their further cōtentation. And thus much I had to say, concerning the offence of foolishnesse and importunacie. I can not but thinke, that your déedes are not discommendable, ne yet vnprofitable, in that you haue In that you are growne in to fauor with your people, and haue obteined their good wil: then whiche, a gouernour hath not a better thing to desire. entred reconciliatiō with your citizens: in that you do your indeuour, y• the number of such as be banished, may be diminished: that you lay to the vttermost of your labor, y• societie in the common welth may be increased: finally, for that, in this sedition, you set before you the state of our citie, as a presidēt or paterne for you to follow. Among all other thinges praise worthy, this one déede is principally to be extolled, that together with the restitution of their country, you also see surrendred, all such possessions and substaunce to those whome you haue called out of comfortlesse exile, as were taken from thē
                  
by force and violence: In which your vsage, you make plaine declaration, that you did not procure their expulsion out of the citie, as incensed with the desire of others mens wealth and riches, but as fearing some danger imminent and hanging ouer the weale publique. But, although you had not ben resolued in any of the aboue cited circumstances, neither yet had receiued into the libertie of their countrie, any person proscript and banished: yet notwithstanding, I would thinke it much for your commoditie, if, to them, of whome I write at this present, you shewe your selues so beneficiall, as to bouchsafe them restitution to their countrie. For, sithence none is ignorant, that in the knowledge and Art of Musike, From the au thoritie and commendatiō of their owne countrie. your citie is incomparable, and that among you, are bred &amp; borne, men maruellous cunning and expert in that professiō: it were an offence tending to dishonestie and dishonour, y• he to whom, not so much as one in this our age can be found equall, in skil of so famous a science, should lose the libertie of such a noble citie.

Wherefore, (my countrie) I among all the rest, being an aduersarie to Pisistratus, depart to bestowe my time elsewhere: as for these men, loe, they are at a becke, both to giue signification of their conceiued fauour, and to scale an assurance of their dutifull obedience.

                  THE ARGVMENT.
                  After his gratulation finished, he maketh mencion with what a loathsome sicknesse he is disquieted: Then hee taketh occasion to write something, of certaine inuētions of his owne, the publishing, or not publishing of which, hee referreth to the iudgement of Thales. Lastly hee falleth into a conclusion answerable to his beginning, wherein he painteth out his terrible and miserable perplexities.

to be the end of him, that so narrowly obserued the starrs reuolution: but wée, neuerthelesse, louing learning, haue that man in great reuerence, leaning to his doctrine and precepts Philosophicall, as to principles of greatest authoritie, and we begin our Or, exercises in reasoning. talke alwayes with ye name of Thales Mylesius.

                  Shewing the perplexities, and troublesome laberynthes, wherewith he is intangled, hee commendeth the prouidence of Pythagoras: betweene whose estate and his owne, he maketh a comparison.

                  Croto, to the intent you may leade a life acquainted with quietnesse: For, as well the Aeacides, with others, are very outragious: and tyraunts also, whose power is violent, haue dominion ouer▪ the Mylesians. Furthermore, the king of Media, layeth sore assault against vs, except we yéeld our selues to be his tributaries: albeit the Ionians séeme to encounter the Medes, in maintenaunce of common libertie. For they trouble vs so extremely, on euerie side, that there is no hope for vs, to escape the hazard and losse of oure liues. With what heart therefore, with what minde, with what desire, may Anaximenes search out the secretes of heauen, who is haunted with the feare of seruitude, and tormented with the terrour of death? As for you, how can your case be but good, sithence the Croto a citie in Italie, neere Tarētum &amp;c. Strabo. lib. 6.

For, in what one thing can we excel others, if that which we haue learned, be frée for euery man to know and exercise him with all? For surely, it is my desire and wil, to outrunne al men, in thinges belonging to learning: yea, I had rather excel in knowledge aboue all other, then in riches, landes and possessions to be péerelesse.

For, we ought not to absteine from doing amisse, through suspicion of following punishment, or for feare of infamie: but, therefro should we be withdrawne, for a regard to equitie, and of an inward honour had to honestie.

               WE Cato Vticen sis of the Stoi cal philosophers professi on. must be of this iudgement (friend I thinke it was C. I. Caesar the comen tariographer: for of that name diuers are recorded in writers. 
                  Caesar) that our soules, concerning the which we haue had often conference, descended and came downe from the heauenly habitation, being sunke (as it were) in the muddie element of grosse earthly substaunce, a place repugnant to celestiall matter, and cleane contrarie to eternitie. Furthermore, we must beléeue, that the immortall and euerlasting Gods, haue instilled and powred our mindes into our bodies, that we shoulde liue in the world after a seuerall order, that we should be occupied in heauenly speculation, viewing the course of celestiall creatures, that in modestie of life and vprightnesse of maners, we might imitate and followe them accordingly.

                  ¶THE ARGVMENT.
                  Because the Epistles of Nucillus, were so Laconicall and shorte, that many of them needed none Argument: we haue therefore compact them al into one body, or boundel: not onely that wee might drawe the meaning of them more commodiously: as because there is suche affinitie and semblaunce in the matter, that we could not doe amisse to ioyne them all together. Neuerthelesse, euery seueral Epistle is distinguished with this mark (*) against whiche also, in the margent, the name of the person is set downe to whome the same was directed. To be short, all the letters runne vpon preceptes, and clauses right woorthie to be remembred.

For he is a man full of affabilitie, milde of nature, and easie to be intreated, his humanitie is singular, his gentlenesse is rare, and the curtesie which he professeth is incomparable. I wold my lucke were so blessed and fortunate, to reape as aboundant an haruest of my conceiued hope, as he hath augmented his vertues, &amp; increased the ornamentes of his noble minde.

For I am restrained and kept backe with a certaine impediment, namely an office of excéeding great authoritie, and maruellous troublesome for the paines ther vnto pertaining. I sit in place of iudgement, I compile bookes, I indite epistles, I scrible many vnperfect pamphlets and letters voyde of all art and learning.

                  ¶ THE ARGVMENT.
                  This letter is certificatorie: wherein hee writeth to a friende, of a friend afflicted with sicknesse: hee reckoneth vp sundrie circumstaunces to his commendation, as well for his inwarde qualities of mynde, as for his outwarde behauiour. Finally, hee addeth a conclusion of well wishing to his friende, that they both might thereby reape some benefite.
               
               MYne abiding and continuance in the citie hath béene somewhat prolonged, where I was troubled in mynde, and also disquieted. The infirmitie, and weakning sicknesse, wherewith Some friend of his with whom he was well acquainted: and was sorrie for his

                  Titus Aristo is sore pinched and pined, ministreth vnto me no small molestation and heauinesse: to whom my loue singularly inclined, as to a man worthy of ad miration. For, thē he, nothing poudered with more grauitie, nothing indued with more faithfulnesse, nothing leauened with more learning and knowledge, in so muche that he séemeth vnto me, so farre from being a man, that euen wisedome &amp; vnderstanding it self, yea al good arts and sciences, as it were in a certain mutual agréemēt, are in him most liuely represented. How skilful is he both in priuate causes perteining to the law, &amp; in controuersies rising among the cōmons?

Howe doth he abounde in reasons and circumstaunces? Howe plentifull is he in vttering examples? howe déepely is he grounded in antiquities? with what vnderstanding is he furnished concerning auncient monumentes? There is nothing in the worlde vniuersall, which a man is desirous to attaine vnto, and with knowledge willing to comprehend, whereof he is not able to giue preceptes, and sufficient to teach and instruet, So often as I make inquisition &amp; search after any abstruse and mystical matter, he is my treasure, he is my storehouse. O, what trueth and honestie is in his language: what authoritie resteth in his countenaunce, and what maiestie: what decencie there is in his delayes, and in his doubtfull demaundes: what subtiltie and quicknesse of wit: what is it whereof he is ignorant? and yet notwithstanding he laboureth oftentimes in a Bycause it is more commendable for a iudge to deliberate and cast doubts in cases of controuersie, then to be ouerquicke and ha stie, which somtimes per uerteth equitie. laberynth of vncertaintie? Bycause it is more commendable for a iudge to deliberate and cast doubts in cases of controuersie, then to be ouerquicke and ha stie, which somtimes per uerteth equitie. he doubteth in diuersitie and sundrie sortes of causes, which he thresheth and sifteth in such sort, that the verie originall and beginnings of them are by him rehearsed, discerned, examined, and considered. Furthermore, howe parciall and sparing in diet, how moderate in apparel and cloathing? When I enter into his chamber, and cast my rolling eyes from corner to corner, yea, when I beholde his bed, and the necessarie furniture there vnto belonging, I sée a liuely representation and image, of the frugalitie and thriftinesse, which was in high estimation among our ancestours. These things are beautified with the noblenes of his nature, which referreth nothing to ostentation, painted popularitie, and vaine glorious opinions, but trieth al things with the touchstone of conscience: and weygheth, whatsoeuer commeth in question to be decided, in the balance of iustice and equitie. The reward of a good déede he fetcheth not from the reporte of the people, but sifteth it out of the circumstances wherby the cause is knowne. To knit vp all in a summarie, no man would be so madde and ouerséene, as to account any one of those, which by outward gesture &amp; habite of the body, make a iollie shew &amp; a glose of singular wisdome, comparable to the man whom I haue mencioned. He is no idle talker, eyther

in hall or gallerie. Neyther doth he make other mens leasure, and his owne quietnesse, Bycause he was so learned and therwithall so wittie in reasoning. delightsome with tedious disputations: but sitting in his long gowne, or riche robe, is occupied in suche matters as are of him to be determined. Or, he is an aduocate to many, and a counseller to more, &amp;c▪ the wordes may admit a double interpretation. He is a furtheraunce to many, in being their aduocate: and an helpe in hassard to such as vse his counsell: in chastitie, in vprightnesse, in iustice, in constancie, he is préeminent, and no mans inferiour. If a man were in his companie and saw his behauiour, he would be astonished: such is his patience, in suffering the sharpe assaultes of his sicknesse, in resisting the violence of sadnesse and sorrowe, in wrestling with thirst which requireth moyst recepts, in passing through the incredible heate of burning feuers, without shrinking. Not many dayes agoe, he called me, and diuers of myne acquaintaunce vnto him, whome he loued entirely, and desired vs to resorte to phys

For the petitions of his louing wife, the lamentations and teares of his deare daugh ter, and the state of vs his good friends, are not to be neglected, all which premisses are directed to one limitted marke, namely, that he would not cancell our hopes (if at least wise they were of assuraunce and not built vpon vanitie) with voluntarie death. That thing doe I estéeme and iudge hard, vneasie, and worthy of principall commendation. For Voluntarie death ought not to be attempted of a

                  ¶THE ARGVMENT.
                  Writing to Crateuas (a Physician, by profession, as it should appeare by the course of his Epistle,) hee commendeth him, first, for his knowledge and cunning: Anon he falleth into mencion of Democritus, whose disease he discouereth: inferring such matter as to circumstaunces and offered occasions seeme most agreeable. Lastly, he entreth into a discourse of hearbes, and so taking occasion to speake as knowledge gaue him vtteraunce, in matters not impertinent to his purpose, he concludeth.

But, although we beléeue, that medicines and healthfull receits are not needefull: yet notwithstanding, it is the point of a wise and skilfull Physician, and suche a one as estéemeth his credite, neuer to be vnprouided: but (as he ought) to haue all things in readinesse, and nothing to séeke when it shoulde be occupied. I haue many times maruelled, at the wonderfull vertue of hearbs wherof you had good store, as at y• nature of al things, y• disposition of al creatures, &amp; y• goodly situatiō of y• earth: which is ye mother of al liuing beasts, of plāts, of trées, of foode, of wealth, of riches, &amp; of al things requirable for ye vs

Nowe, to turne my talke to you againe, touching the matter first named, I would haue you perseuere and continue your exercise, gathering such hearbs and plantes as growe in highe mountaines, in loftie and hautie places inclined to no moystnesse, where the earth hath thicknesse, and the aire finesse. For, what these haue in them by vertue of attraction, is forceable to prolong life. Neuerthelesse, touching the flowers of such hearbes, as spring by the sides of lakes, fennie soyles, waterie groundes, neare to the flowe of riuers, or suche places, as we call brookes and springs, they haue not in them suche efficacie and notable operation: suche quicknesse, and swéetenesse, I am well assured. Wherefore suche hearbes, out of whiche you straine and wring the iuice and moysture, procure to be conueyed vnto me in glasses: but such hearbes, whose flowres and leaues must do vs seruice, put into earthen vessels, well couered and close stopped, least, féeling the blastes of the winde, they wyther, dye, and lose their proper vertue instilled into them by the prouidence of Nature, for medicinable cōpositions: Thus when ye haue done, sende them vnto me, with as much spéede as you can make. Moreouer, I can not but fall in consideration of the season of the yere, being now the Spring: a time, then which for the purpose, none more conuenient: so that I am cōstrained of necessitie, to take vpon me, the cure of the foresayde madde maladie.

For, Brute beastes wanting the gift of vnderstanding, when their appetite or lust is satisfied, they beat ease and quiet, for a season, not seeking further to haue more when they are once filled. No Lyon hath beene heard of at any time, to hyde gold in the secrete celles of the earth. So long thirsteth the Beare, till hee haue water sufficient.

Beastes and byrdes ceasse from the acte of ingendring, a whole yeares space almoste: man is euermore busie in that bodily pleasure, and like a bottomlesse hell hath neuer enough. Whether will you that I laugh at him, that lamenteth his lewde loues, from the enioying and swéetnesse whereof he is excluded, when his substance is consumed? Whether wil you that I laugh at him, who putteth al that he is woorth, and more too, in aduenture on the tossing and tempestuous floudes, hauing before cursed the sea with a thousand execrations, when he suffered shipwracke? Whether will you that I laughe at him, who fraughteth his shipp with heauier and weightier burthens, hauing bewailed the losse of suche wares as hee had before imbarcked? O Hippocrates,

But as fortune falleth, our sore is none suche as it should stand in néede of saluing: and therefore spare your paines, least, employing it where it ought not, you reape an yll recompence? Your progenitour Acsculapius may serue for an example sufficient, who when he had by his medicinable confections, reserued the benefite of healthfulnesse vnto mortall men, was blasted from heauen with souden lightning, for his presumptious enterprise, reaping that terrible punishment, for a recompence.

What thinke you of man himself? is he any thing else, euen from his conception &amp; natiuitie but a very dunghil of diseases? Loke vpon him with a circumspect eye, consider of his estate and condition by degrees: in his infancie, he is fitte for nothing: in his childehod, he is wantonly disposed: in the pearle of his youthe he is foolish, resisting to be ruled by a tutor: in his lustie yeares, he is at his own swinge, &amp; wil (in no wise) bite any longer on the bridle: hee is ambitious, and ouer busie in many matters, in his manhod: in his olde age he doteth &amp; walloweth in wretchednes, hauing spent the whole course of his former life, in vanitie, without reason: for, man is miserable euen from his mothers wombe.

For suche as bée disseased, if it so chaunce that they recouer, and be set at libertie from the daunger of their sicknesse, they doe either giue all the thankes to the Gods, or else to fortune: moreouer, many a one being of an ouerthwart and peruerse inclination, repine at them wt hateful hartes, at whose hands they haue receiued many a benefite, and they take the matter heinously, that it should be thought, that they stand in néede of anothers help &amp; succour.

                  THE ARGVMENT.
                  He writeth his opinion briefly touching death: sheweth that as a man is before he is begotten, so is he when soule and body bee separated, wherupon he exhorteth Hippo not to be touched with any terrour of thinges to come hereafter, adioyning his reason: lastly, he concludeth with his owne phantasticall determination.
               
               YOur will is, that I write somewhat vnto you, touching death and the graue, after mine owne iudgement, as if you should not proue a perfect Philosopher, except we teach you, as our scholer. I am therefore of this opinion, that it is enough for vs, to leade our liues according to the prescripte rule of nature and vertue, whiche thing is not beyonde our capacities to comprehend. And as for thinges after deathe, I thinke they are then, euen as they were before their life.
               For, as a man is As is he had said: man before he was indued with life, was nothing: so, after deathe he is (in like manner) nothing. before his byrthe, so is he after his death. Let not the feare of any thing to come, turne you to disquietuesse of minde, sithence you shalbe senselesse and quite voide of life and féeling. As for mée selfe, I haue determined, when I am dead, to haue my staffe lying close by my carkasse, that what beast, byrde, or vermine so euer come to do me harme and annoyaunce, I maye ehace them away.

Finally, he exhorteth Locritus not to be ouermuche grieued for the losse of his sonne.

                  THE ARGVMENT.
                  To a singular Poet named Theotimus, this letter is written by Synesius, wherein is first signified, (by comparison of Simonides &amp; Hiero) that commoditie did spring from the acquaintance, which was between him and Authemius: he endeth with a commendation of the same Theotimus, for his excellencie in the Art Poeticall.
               
               
                  Hiero

                     acuse: of whō Aelianus, in Var. histor. lib 6. of the same there was ano ther, an Athenien. had more commoditie, by kéeping companie with Simonides, then This Simonides was the first inuenter of the Art me moratiue: Cic. in Ora. he deuised also these double letters in the Greeke Alphabete (namly 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      as saith Eustathius. &amp;c. 
                  Simonides had by vsing the familiaritie of Hiero. Euen so (by the heauenly vertue whiche gouerneth the fréendship wherwith we be vnited, I sweare) thou arte not more happie by béeing acquainted with Authemius, then Authemius is, by the benefit of knowing your person. For, what maketh more for the honour of a man in highe aduauncement, and supported with power, then to haue suche a fréend, as is faithful and vnfeigned? such a one, I am certaine, Theotimus is, a man passing courteous, and with God most acceptable. But in this point you do excéede &amp; goe beyonde Simonides: in that Simonides measured his seruice by profite and aduantage: Againe, in this you agree, &amp; séeme to shoote both at a semblable marke: in y• 
                  This Simonides was the first inuenter of the Art me moratiue: Cic. in Ora. he deuised also these double letters in the Greeke Alphabete (namly

                  Simonides
                  
commended Hiero to euerlasting memorie: and in that also the Poesies of Theotimus, so long as any Grecians shall be left on liue, haue made Authemius famous by the report of euery mans mouth, famous I say in the eares of al, that shal heare of his person. It is his part to seeke the increase of the Romanes renoune: &amp; it is your duetie to extoll his name with the instrument of your profession. For, to the practise of Poetrie, is graunted (as it were by diuine influence) the wreath of worship, &amp; the garland of honour, the excellencie whereof, moste euidently in you appeareth.

He signifieth also, that his minde continueth vnchaungeable, so that there is no cause of fainting in freendshippe to be mistrusted.

These and such like circumstances ought to occupie a place in oure braine, vppon these things we ought to studie and deliberate, if wée looke to liue, till our last day and houre, without troublesome thoughtes: if we wish the approching of death not to be terrible, the feare wherof filleth all our life with disquietnesse and vexatiō.

Pouertie vsed according to the prescript lawes of nature, is great riches: and what limits nature hath assigned &amp; tyed vs vnto, you are not ignorant: namely to hunger, to thyrst, to sweate, to ware chill, against which infirmities she hath also appointed remedies. It is a bootelesse toile, to aduenture the seas: it is lost labour to follow the campe: that which nature requireth is easie to be gotten, and is bought for a small price: but things superfluous require tedious traueile.

                  YEt againe you make your selfe of no account nor calling: and you complaine that your lucke is ouerthwart. I tell you that Philosophie hath not respect to the person of any man: she offereth her selfe indifferently to euery ones embracing. Socrates ruffled not in his robes of magistracie. Cleanthes was a water drawer, Cleanthes playde the gardener, Cleanthes let out his handes to hire. Philosophie made Plato famous and honourable, being before but base in degrée. Why then should you cast doubts of despaire in your minde, as though there were such impossibilities, that you should neuer aspire to the like worthinesse? Who is a Gentleman? Who is a Noble man? Euen he, who of nature, is applyable to vertue. The court replenished with vaine shewes of brauerie, maketh not a noble Gentleman: but the mind which wrestleth and ouercommeth fortune, in what condition of life soeuer, perf

But to trouble so noble a Gentleman, with vaine and vnnecessarie letters, (who doth not onely with power and maiestie, but also with iustice and vprightnesse, gouerne the chiefest cities in Italie, and the sundry estates of many people,) I suspected that it was the part of a man bewitched with extreme foolishnesse: or else of one y• is drowned in the whirlpoole of shamelesnesse.

               P. Manutius to Jo. Sambuco.
               
                  THE ARGVMENT.
                  After hee hath made mencion of his inwarde sorrowe conceiued through the death of his yong sonne, be beginneth to be cōforted with the remembraunce and consideration of his friendes counsell: hee declareth his infallible affiaunce, touching his ioyful estate of heauen, after his transmigration out of the labyrinth of this life: he sheweth what kinde of life true wise men do imbrace: he signifieth what great oddes there is betweene Sambucoes his condition, and his owne estate: hee complaineth of the benignitie of princes, which in olde time flourished, but is nowe banished: crieth out against the vanities of men and their inordinate vsage: lastly, hee lamenteth the miserable case of learning, detecting therewithall the hypocriticall dealing of diuers men, and their notable dissembling: this being done, hee maketh an abrupt conclusion.
               
               AFter that the heauie and ruthfull newes of my sonnes death, had pearced into mine eares, I was so ful of grief, sorrowe, and anguish of heart, that I remembred myne own mortalitie, and considered also that his entraunce into this wretched worlde, was like the state of a soiourner in a common Inne, that when so euer it pleased God, to call him out of this painful pilgrimage, he might passe into the paradise of heauenly pleasure, the ioyes whereof are not subiect to corruption, but coupled with euerlastingnesse. And thoughe this lamentable lucke, had so wounded my heart with weapons of wofulnesse, that I shoulde haue fallen downe, as one ouerthrowne and vanquished: yet notwithstanding, I shoulde haue recouered, tasting the prudent preceptes of your learned letters, wherein you discourse right worthily, how lamentations shoulde bée allayed, and heauinesse of heart assuaged: wherein whiles you occupie Your braine or your wit, and your pen, the one to inuent and deuise: the other to write and set down your meaning. youre heade and your hande, you giue manifest declarations of your good and vertuous disposition, wel beséeming a true and

vnfeined christian: and towards me, you shew most assured warrants of beneuolence and heartie good will. But (friend Sambucus) by the experience of many foule misfortunes, I haue learned to contemne and to be at des
                     •…
                  aunce with blinde Fortune her self, who shall neuer haue the power to depriue me of those things which she can not giue (wel may she dispossesse me of Bycause all outward thin ges (the externall ornamēts of the bodie, and the abilities of the same, whiche are called corporall faculties, excepted) are saide to be the giftes &amp; goods of Fortune. trāsitorie vanities) neither is it in her abilitie to bestowe vpon any man, an vpright mynde, a true meaning conscience, honest and vertuous purposes, loue and reuerence towardes God, and such like precious ornamentes. I despaire not of my sonne, he is in excéeding good case, I am not otherwise persuaded: he enioyeth the companie and fellowship of angels, of holy men, blessed martyrs, and innocent soules: the cares of this world do not choake him, wherwith a great number are stoung and strangled. He is not carried away with vaine hope, as many be in their miserie: he is not a slaue to feare, wherwith innumerable multitudes are tormented in the flowre of their felicitie, least it should wither, and then they to incurre the inconueniences of alteration: He is frée from all these molestations, they touche him not, they haue no power to inuade him, or do him violence. But, we wretched people, that are sayde to be aliue, in whose eyes nothing appeareth more glorious, then the inioying of a counterfet and deceiuable light, which is nothing indeede but a very vapour and the shadowe of a vapour, and hath a time assigned wherein it shall vanish, with how many myllians of miseries are we tormented, tossed, and turmoyled to and fro, not vnlike a ship vpon the sourging seas? we labor, we take care, and what though we obtein the end of our desire, and the scope of our trauel, our life must haue a time to cease. Wisemē, I mean not such as be worldly wise, but those that be wise to God warde, are wont to wish, what? a long life? nay, but a good life, and such a life as is not repugnant to vertue, wherevnto I (in semblable manner) contende and doe what I can to aspire, hoping that I shall in the ende obteine it, to my full contentation and heartes ease. For nothing doeth so muche occupie my mynde, and drawe

away my cogitations, then the desire to frame and fashion myselfe orderly in that trade of life, wherevnto I am appointed, and in such due and conuenient sort to continue the course of my yeares, that I may be able thereof both to God him selfe to render an account, and to men also to giue a reckoning: this is my meditation: this is the marke whereat all my purposes and intentes are leuelled. Wherefore, in that you call vppon me, not to withdrawe, but rather to apply my penne to writing, (I must néedes say the trueth as it is) my determinations and counselles, are established with your iudgement: and you (vndoubtedly) in giuing me this exhortation, doe as many more besides, to whose desires I could (peraduenture) shewe my selfe satisfactorie, if I were not otherwise, with the burthen of my priuate and domeslitall businesse, hindered. But, I beséech you, measure not my leasure by your vacations and times of pausing: considering the estate of vs both: you haue all things readie at hand, you néede not doubt of their vncerteintie, you haue them at commaundement and seruice, without cumbersomenesse: as for me, myne estate is farre otherwise, myne owne industrie is my prouision and maintenaunce, none other succour haue I: that is my only and alone supportation, the staffe and stay of my children, the prop and maine poste of all my housholde and familie: thus to doe I am constrained, and if therein I shew my selfe dissolute and negligent, I must néedes forsake all humanitie: and if I be as carefull, diligent and circumspect in séeing to the charge thereof, as I am bound in conscience, then must my exercises at my studies cease of necessitie, whiche require a mynde frée from all kinde of worldly thoughts, and not a mynd clogged with cares, &amp; quite ouer

But you wil say (peraduenture) your owne studies will be your aduauntage, they can not but affoorde some profite, they will be your sufficient purueyance. Sing this song to others, that doe neyther knowe maners of people, nor seasons of time: the sound thereof should not so sinke into myne eares, I will not be persuasible thervnto, sithence I am one, that in eyther of both haue not wanted experience. The

bountifulnesse of princes, which in auncient time most prosperously flourished, it is nowe wasted and withered. The greatest part of men, what doe they? euen folowe vaine fancies, toyes, and transitorie shadowes: they loue nothing that hath in it * sap and substance: they set not their affection vpō that which is renouned, they care not, neyther haue in any account, that which is honourable &amp; excellent. You shal see some, Telluris inutile pondus: as the Poet saith.

                      good for nothing that is vertuous and honest, much like vnto Caterpillers deuouring the reuenues and increase of the earth, being thervnto, euen from their byrth, appointed and ordeined: spending and confuming, wealth, riches, treasures, landes, possessions, hereditaments, &amp;c. in excessiue bellie cheare, and pampering the paunche, farre beyond the boundes of Epicurisime. You shall see othersome, so married to mischiefe, and wedded to most detestable wickednesse, that they do not only wast their welth &amp; al that they haue, in consuming the increase and crop of the ground, by meanes immoderate, but also (which they count noblenesse and valiancie) in committing that which tendeth to the destruction of people, in preparations for battell and bloudshed, which drawe after them most miserable and manifolde calamities, wastefulnesse and spoyle to arable landes: setting on fire whole townes and cities: and to one man wrapped in wofull wretchednesse, by anothers want of wit, losse of life, an irrecouerable casualtie. Thus whiles the mindes of men wander in wildernesses of enormities, the By Muses in this place, speaking figu ratiuely, he meaneth learning: For the Muses were the Ladies of learning, as not so muche as the most ig norant, but knoweth. Muses famishe, they starue, they perish with want of mainteinance, they are thrust out of house and home, and turned (as it were) a begging, from post to piller, through their cruell vsage, who as they ought principally, so they might most liberally haue seene thē succoured. Furthermore, what a shameful and detestable thing is it, that some vnder the pretence of a liberal hart, hunt after their owne honour and aduauncement, hauing in their mouthes that vertue wherof they haue no portion, so common &amp; familiar, as though they did highly loue it, esteeme it, and had it in reuerence. But thus far sufficient, and too much peraduenture.

                  First he complaineth of his tedious iourney, and also of his sicknes, both whiche turned him to trouble, and made him prolong his time of writing. The greatest part, and in manner all the Epistle, conteineth a commendation and an acknowledgement of Benedicto Accolto his curtesie, with certaine professions of his owne thankfulnesse: both which, the one in his friend, the other in him selfe, he continueth euen to the last line of his letter, and thervpon (immediately) inferreth his farewell.

If euer myne abilitie be answerable to my desire, I wil do mine indeuour to make full recompence: and yet neuerthelesse, I will let slip no time wherein I may giue some tryall of acquitaunce. In the meane season, I will not onely confesse my selfe to be your debter, and that vnfeinedly: but myne owne tong shal beare witnesse of the same, with my conscience in al places and in all companies, and that not vnwillingly. He maketh it a matter of great account to haue the friendship and fauor of such a one, as is not only in au thoritie, but also furnished with the preci ous ornamēts of vertue, and learning. For what can redound more to myne honestie, and to myne honour, then that you, being a man furnished with all vertuous ornaments, possessing a stately roome of authoritie and excellent dignitie, discerning the secrete dispositions of mens seuerall natures, by the soundnesse and certaintie of your iudgement, shoulde pretermit and let passe, no kinde of courtesie, no kynde of friendly vsage, which might tende either to my commoditie, or to my cōmendation? Now vndoubtedly shal I disclose the truth wtout hypocrisie? there was neuer any thing so auailable as this, to make vs grow in credit among men through this praise worthy opinion of learning and honestie. Wherfore, as mine intent was to treade in the same path, whiche my father before me had passed through, and worne with his frequent and often going, leading directly to the triumphant tower of renoune, as (I say) I framed my selfe by my fathers exāple; to be thus exercised: so now, through the incitation &amp; incouragemēt of your courteonsly conceiued opiniō, I wil be y• more earnest, &amp; aduised, to make it mine accustomed practise: vnto which opinion, I feare greatly, that I shall not be able to affoorde answerable seruice: and thus much I knowy• it is no easie thing, nay, it is as hard a matter as can be, to sée the same satisfied, with such measure of dutifulnesse, as is requisite. Neuerthelesse, bicause I leade my lingering life in such order, that so much time and leasure, as my weakenesse of body doth permit, I bestow at my booke, and (as it were) de siring to quench y• continual thirst wherewt I am attainted, draw liquor out of y• self same springs &amp; riuers, from whence

euen y• chiefest and the greatest instruments of your renoune tooke their beginning. I build vpon sure hope &amp; stedfast confidence, that all men shall thinke your benefites well bestowed: and that you your selfe (in like manner) shall perceiue (thoughe it bée somewhat longe) that the amendes which I am to make, are not to be contemned, nor lightly to be regarded: till the accomplishment and performance whereof, it is my duetie, Which is the duetie of a thankful man and vpon such a one a benefite cannot be ill bestowed. to remember your singular beneuolence, yea so to remember it, that I neuer forget it: and it shall béelong to your courtesie, to continue for euer that goodwil which of your owne accord you haue applied to the procurement of my profite, that in the same, by the same, and through y• same, I may not be destitute of my desired succour: y• one of which, I meane to the vttermost of my power, to sée accomplished: and touching the perfourmance of the other, (such is the incredible bountifulnesse of your noble nature) you are not to be admonished.

                  THE ARGVMENT.
                  This epistle differreth very litle from the former: for thoughe in words it varrie, yet in sense it doth very litle disagree: the summe and totall effect thereof, consisteth in the acknowledging of benefites receiued: whereunto are annexed certaine significations of his owne thanckfull heart: In the conclusion of the epistle, hee promisseth to shewe himselfe recōpenceable to his power, though not with like recourse of benefits, yet with giuing thankes.
               
               THe Hee be ginneth still with the consession of a thankfull heart. auncient duetifulnesse, which I owe to your reuerence, taking beginning and roote, srom the gratious ornamentes of your noble nature, required (vndeubtedly) to write some thing vnto you in an epistle: but there were hindraunces alwayes in these purposes, whereby I was both amased as mistrusting, and discouraged as not daring to take in hand such an aduenture: namely, the dignitie and worthinesse

of your calling, and the excellencie of your person. For, I was carried into thoughtes of vncertaintie, and conceiued an inward reuoking feare, least in sending vaine and trifling letters, to such a man, vppon whome continuall burthens of great and weightie buisinesse doe attend, I should shewe and bewray the pointe of an impudent and shamelesse fellowe. But nowe I will declare my minde truely and vnfaynedly: I finde fault, and doe almost euen accuse Which is in some so aboū dante, that it turneth to their discommoditie: wher fore modestie in measure &amp; with reason, is commendable and also profitable. my modestie: because, whiles I am consulting and deliberating to write to your reuerence, and yet bring not the accompts of my determinations to perfourmance, it commeth to passe (in the meane season, these delaying causes béeing vsed) that your Which is in some so aboū dante, that it turneth to their discommoditie: wher fore modestie in measure &amp; with reason, is commendable and also profitable. humanitie outrunneth, and recouereth much ground of my duetifulnesse, althoughe I am full loathe, that your beneuolence, should suffer further triall (whome I knowe, to bée a man for the excellencie of your vertues, right praise worthie, whereunto I may not, neither canne aspire) considering that euen in this which you haue alreadie done (béeing a principal pointe of your good will towardes mée, &amp; then the which I estéeme nothing more precious,) no ydle proofe of your bountie, (in partile requiting whereof, I remaine a debtour,) appeareth. Wherefore, as I am ashamed and repent mée of my bashfulnesse, in that I had not the audacitie and bouldnesse to write to your reuerence, no not euen then, when my will and desire was in excéeding great towardnesse: euen so I féele my selfe meruayloufly delighted, in this comfortable &amp; ioyfull declaration of your woonted kindnesse, together with the commendations which it pleaseth you to bestowe vppon mée, in your praysing Epistle. And surely, I would not you should thincke, that I haue either attempted, or accomplished any thing without mine vnwearisome labours, and incessaunt watchinges (which deserued well lyking, and not controlling contempt) that I was in hope to reape any other aduauntage, or to obteine any better reward, then I haue already recouered, through the iudgement and testimonie of you, and such as bée like you: Prelates (I meane) of

highe calling, and for their vertue most renowmed: which if I haue gotten, I thincke mée selfe wel recompenced, and I triumph therin, and reioyce. But if you do so commend mée (which indéed I may suspecte) as if by your words you would incourage mée, fainting (as it were) and waxing wearie in the race which I haue to runne: yet notwithstanding, euen thereby, as with a principall benefite, you binde mée to haue you in reuerence: fythence, if any thing in the worlde bée forceable and effectuall, to persuade and prouoke mée, it is your authoritie, wherein that working chiefely consisteth. Wherefore, I wil so order my doinges, and therein vse such diligence, that I may bée thought, truly to interprete and expounde the meaning of your epistle. For, I will bée more industrious, more circumspect, more earnest and painefull, to obteine those thinges, which whosoeuer doeth purchase and possesse, he cannot but enioy the pension of perfect praise. And to turne the residue of my talcke to your highnesse, whom it hath pleased courteously to visite mée with the embassage of a most louing letter, and voluntarily (without the helpe of any mediatour) to graunt mée frée passage and accesse to your friendshippe, which a long time I desired, and now at lengthe to the full delight of my heart, I haue obteined, if I bée not able to make sufficient recompence for such speciall benefites as I haue receiued, (sythence I owe more to your goodnesse, then it is possible for mée to discharge, and sée fully payed) yet will I (at least) not shewe my selfe Lest all that you haue don for my weale, should seeme vtterly lost &amp; cast away. vnthanckfull: and I am content, in consideration of abilitie, to remaine your debtour, but in respect of my will and desire, I will doe what I can, that my duetie be not vnsatisfied.

Com. conceiued. Hee giueth a short note (by the way) of such things, wherby men ostentimes are aduaunced: among which hee maketh mencion of vertue, which being lest regarded, is also lest auayleable to preferre such men, of whome shee is possessed: hee praiseth P. Pius the fourth of that name: sheweth that rewards &amp; punishments are the maintenaunces of all well ordered commonwealthes: praiseth him, for sundrie considerations, to whome he writeth this epistle: professeth that hee was exceeding glad, when he was infourmed, that he was made Cardinall, and so concludeth.

For, vppon that day it pleased our Gratious Lord, and high bishop, with other worthie Prelates and excellent men, to nominate and create you Cardinall, which thing all good and vertuous men most hartily desired. Let vs now stopp the course of our complaintes. Let vs not saye that vertue is vnprouided of a place, which heretofore hath béene the lamentable song of a great number: and surely, not wichout iust occasion. For some haue béene aduaunced to degrées of statelynesse, through the noblenesse of their byrth: othersome haue growne in countenaunce by the meanes of their riches and possessions: and some by one thing some by another, haue crept vpp to authoritie: onely Uertue hath béene to a verie fewe an instrument and helpe to preferment. This blemishe and offensiue inconuenience is nowe abolished, and the auncient custome of high Bishopps, which verie fewe haue obserued, that long hath béene desired, by

and through y• wysedome of P. Pius (the fourth of that name by succession in the seate of supremacie) which is so excellent, that it can neuer bée sufficiently commended, is renewed. Which béeing come to passe, I am assured, that according to the ful measure of perseuerance and knowledge, wherwt you bée stoared, you are not to be taught, what belongeth to the function whereunto you are called, nor yet what things your present dignitie requireth, or to your life past vertuously gouerned, is agréeable. Thus much I haue to say, and I may bouldly affirme it, that with one heart toung &amp; voyce, al good men throughout the whole cōmonwelth, reioyce &amp; are excéeding glad, for this your aduancement: &amp; that they giue infinit thankes, with al reuerence, to our Gracious Lord and chiefe bishop, for that it hath pleased him, in these troublesome and daungerous dayes; to choose such a sure prop and substantiall piller (as you) to stay vpp the Churche, when it was like to fall, and ready to runne to ruine: offering vnto you this honourable roome, whereunto you are now elected, of his owne voluntarie motion, not being required: bestowing vpon you (I say) this place of preeminence, which Francisco Cō menduno, pre ferred before many gentlemen of a good house, to the dignitie of a Cardinall. to diuerse noble Gentlemen, earnestly labouring and making great suite for the same, hée thought more méete to bée denyed, then to bée graunted.

Neuerthelesse, if in y• due administration of two specialties (namely Punishment and Recompence) the safetie of the commonwealth consisteth, as Philosophers &amp; men of excéeding great wisedome and learning, haue left witnessed in writing: good cause then (no doubt) there is to reioyce in both, sythen

There is no kinde of people more painefull, able and willing (I meane) to susteine labours, none in manners and behauiours more trustie &amp; deseruing credit, none for simplicitie plainesse &amp; vprightnes in dealing, more to be cōmended, or at least wise, they principally praise worthie.

Besides that, he is a man of suche a minde and gentle spirit, so honest and vpright in conuersation, and not destitute of any thing that is requireable in humanitie, that the same concurring, and as it were running hand in hande with his wonderfull knowledge, that he maketh A thing deseruing singular commendation. suche to loue learning excéedingly, and to haue it in reuerence, as before coulde by no meanes digest it, by reason of their continuall loathing.

In versifying, he hath a peculiar maiestie, and grace: his deuises are not darkened with mystie cloudes of doubtes, the conueiaunce of his matter is manifest and perceiuable: to conclude, the soyle of his inuention, memorie, and iudgement, is so ordinarily ploughed with practise and experience, that in all his dooinges hee is plentifull and delectable. There is no Argument, no matter (I meane) so barren, so to be misliked, so vndisputable, but if he haue it in handling, it shalbe bothe pleasaunt and profitable. In writing proese, he is so like, or rather so vnlike him selfe, that a man reading and marking his methode and style therein, would thinke that in versifying he is but a smatterer, and not that scarcely.

What beasts they bee, none can be so igno raunt &amp; blockish, but may perceiue and testifie. Some beastes there are, which vnto vs are most profitable, by yéelding the increase of their bodies, for our succour and maintenaunce: and as they are vnto man principall benefites, so to themselues and to their kind, they are most louing and tender: very fewe or none at all, are there to bée found, so barren and fruitlesse, which yéeld not some commoditie or other for our behoofe. If wée séeke a proofe hereof in fishes, that liue by water, wée shal sée a manifest example. The fishe called Balena, nourisheth her younge with milke: the fishe called Cephalus bringeth forth egges: the Dolphine féedeth her young with milke in like maner, and that abundantly: when the Springtide approcheth, they couple, and they bring foorth in the Summer season: the fishe called Echinus, bringeth foorth egges: the fishe called Hippocampus, is a present and souereigne remedie, against the byting of a madde dogge: and as all these loue their owne kinde tenderly: so they are by one meanes or another, seruiceable to man. Now let vs sée the kindnesse which resteth in the fowles of the ayre, which is wonderfull: and let vs marke their qualities, for they are straunge. The

The A straung propertie of naturall affection described in the swallowe. swallow bringeth foorth foure young ones, whom shee fostereth and féedeth in true measure of equitie and loue, beginning with the eldest, and so kéeping order in the residue. Now I will descend to other liuing creatures, and what is to be said in this case, concerning the beastes of the field, you shall likewise vnderstand. The Ore is a fellowe labourer with his maister, hée aswageth the tediousnesse of his sweating trauell: they are husbandmen, for they till the land, they drawe the plough, they furrowe the soyle, they carrie the croppe of the ground into the Barne, and other seruices doe they, so that wée finde speciall benefites redounding to vs, by and through the vse of their ministerie.

                  eade and slaine, that their flesh might turne to our nourishment: they loue their young bleating lambes, to whome they giue sucke most tenderly. The Bée flyeth about the fragrant féeld, and the swéete garden, gathering of euery flower somewhat, to carrie to her hiue, where shée laboureth in making honie. The hogge is fatt fedde, with oakehornes and other meate, of purpose to become our sustenaunce. Iohannes Ca ius, in his letrer sent to Cō radus Gesnerus, sheweth at large the properties of dog ges, their seuerall kinds and seruices. The dogge is a diligent dorekéeper, a circumspect watchman, a necessarie seruaunt: driueth away the rauening. Woolfe from the flock, least there should bée a spoile and flaughter committed: they kéepe, preserue, and defend our houses from théeues, vagaboundes, lewde fellowes, robbers, and false knaues, who watche opportunitie, leasure and time conuenient, when they might (to their

contentation and fulfilling of their desires) put their mischefous deuises in practise. The Catt frayeth away rattes, myce, and noysome vermine, and haunteth euerie chamber though it bée neuer so secrets. Thus whiles I looke before mée, behinde mée, béeside mée, nowe on this hand, and then on that hande, I finde nothing, but is occupied and that most diligently, in perfourming those thinges wherunto by Nature they were appointed. I finde What a shame is it then for man being indued with reasō, (or at least ought to bee) knowledge and vnderstanding &amp;c. should giue himselfe to ydlenesse? nothing that loueth slouth, that is inclined to ydlenesse, but euerie creature in his kinde, dooing their duetie, in that seruice whereunto they are alotted accordingly. What then, (that I may yet at the lengthe come to my purpose) should wée doe, to whome the light of reason so graciously is giuen? What (I saye) should wée buisie our heades and handes about? Wherein should wée bée exercised? Are wée brought to so lowe an ebb of discretion, and to so highe a floud of follie, that wée are content to bée ouercome of brute beastes, whome wée ought to excell (for howe doe wée passe them, or howe canne wée bée better then they, vnlesse wée haue the vse of those benefites which wée are

Let vs not so wallowe in the waues of ydlenesse, that at lengthe wée bée ouerwhelmed. Let vs not vse the societie and fellowshippe of lazie slouthe, with satietie and excesse, least at laste wée bée so intangled in her snares, that wée finde no way to vnwinde oure selues againe. Nay rather, let vs followe the example of painefull Apelles a no ble painter of the countrie Cos, an Iland in the Acgean sea: of him Quint. lib. 12. de instit. orat. Plin. lib. 35. 
                  Apelles, of whome Plinie maketh mencion, who was such an enimie to ydlenesse, that his pencill was neuer drie, but still drawinge a line, in one colour or another. Let vs abhorre to resemble that slouthfull slouen, who lead all his life in the countrie in such order, that hée differed nothing from a dead carkasse, lying in the graue. The yeare hath runne his course. The ground hath yéelded her cropp. Ortchardes haue giuen the increase of their fruite.

Hauing delt before with exāples: Now hee falleth to admonitions, exhortations, persuasions, &amp;c. Let vs (for shame) start out of the cabbine of this carelessnesse: Let vs shake off this slouthfulnesse, and nowe at lengthe (though somewhat late, yet Better late then neuer,) call to remembraunce, what reproche and infamie doeth flowe from ydlenesse. Let vs call to consideration, what an ignominious name, wée are like to purchase, if wée wincke at such a foule and loathsome vice: if (I say) wée will not sée it in our selues, and doe what wée may, to haue it redressed: let vs call to memorie, what hazardes and inconueniences hang ouer our heades, béeing readie to fall vppon vs, for this our dissolutenesse and negligence.

whole delight is in deuising mischiefe, and putting the same in execution: to bée profitable members to the bodie of oure naturall countrie, within whose vowels wée are so tenderly and louingly included and clasped: to resist the vsurping potentacie, and outragious rule of thundering Tyraunts. Let vs try what wée can doe, a fewe of vs gathered together, not contemning one anothers infancie and young knowledge, but alowing one anothers weakenesse of wit, which, though it bée but rawe, yet in tracte of time, (there is no doubt) it wil waxe riper.

The stronge Captaine and valliaunt warriour, was once wrapped in swathling clowtes, and lay crying in a wicker cradle. Those graue and wise counsellours, that are propps and pillers of Princes places, and the columnes or maine postes of the weale publique, though nowe for their knowledge and policie, they drawe the mindes of people into an admiration: yet the time hath béene, wherein they had their first beginning, going to schole, and learning their Alphabet or A. B. C. Wil you require that at the hāds of a simple childe, (whose witt is but weake, whose vnderstanding is slender, whose iudgement is rawe) which beséemeth Cicero that incomparable Rhetorician? Will you lay a heauie and weightie burthen, vppon the neckes and shoulders of a young beginner, of a weakling, of an infant, which is able to make Demosthenes sincke vnder it, and falter to the grounde? No, but you must haue due regard and consideration of yeares. For The first mē ber of the clause followeth of necessitie: but the last is not alwayes grounded vppō certaintie: for we see the contrarie proued by daily experience.

                  ¶ THE ARGVMENT.
                  This epistle conteineth three parts in respect of the persons, namely, him to whom it is written: him by whom it is written: and him in whose behalfe it is written. In cōsideration of the matter, it cō
                     teineth foure partes: in the first is comprehended the seeking of goodwil, by circumstaunces: In the second the causes that moued him to write, &amp;c. In the third, hee praiseth Gualtero, whome hee commendeth to Chrysogono, &amp;c. In the fourth hee toucheth the matter it selfe, by circumstances, well worthie of reading▪ marking and learning.
               
               BUt that I knowe of a certaintie, your singular beneuolence, not tēding to mine auaile alone, but fréely testified to the profite of al such as loue learning, albeit they bée méete straungers: I should bée in doubt (friend Chrysogono) to interrupt the quietnesse of your studies, through my temeriritie and rashnesse. Neuerthelesse, sythence I am not ignoraunt, that for the renewing of old friendshipp, your desire is rather to be sollicited, then, to the vtter vanishiug of acquaintaunce, not at all to bée visited, I armed my selfe with audacitie: and in my friends behalfe, I confesse mée your suppliaunt. My welwiller Gualtero, at whose hands you receiue these my letters, is one whome I do most ardently loue, and (for his singular kindnesse vnto mée alwayes professed) excéedingly fauour. For, Which good nature in him so apparant &amp; plentiful, kindleth in mee the more louing affectiō. euer since the time of his infancie, hée hath exhibited vnto mée, as to his father naturall, passing reuerence, duetifulnesse, and obedience. This man, vnderstanding vndoubtedly, that I was one of whome you did well thincke and estéeme, and hoping also by the mediation of my letters vnto you, to gett your fauour and furtheraunce, béesought mée instantly, to write vnto you in his cause, that his suite might bée satisfied: althoughe I mistrust not the modestie of the man, his honestie, and vertuous behauiours,

but that, without our commendable certificate, hée is like enoughe to please and preuaile. For, hée is a proper youthe, descended of well disposed parentes, though somewhat base in degrée, and with substaunce not so well furnished. His education and bringing vp was so good, as it cannot bée misliked, and from his tender yeares til this present day, he hath béene not onely inclined to learning, but

               FOr as much, as I haue learned by common voice, that you are a man not onely indued with wisedome, but also of a very good and vpright conscience, besides that of a rare disposition to vertue and vertuous exercises, I hope you will not be offended, if I, being touched with a certaine brotherly kindnesse, discouer vnto you the crimes of such as be of your affinitie and consanguinitie (notwithstanding I am vnknowen vnto you, and a méere straunger) to the intent that he which hath done amisse, may be allured to amendment: or that you (if by any meanes it maye be brought to passe) may (yet in time) saue your good name from the blemishe of rebuke, and your worship vndamnified. For, it is the dutie of a good man, to winke no more at the faultes of his kinsefolke, then at the misdeedes of suche as are neyther of his alliaunce, nor yet of his acquaintaunce: and no lesse to punishe such as are neare to him by degree of bloud (so farre foorth as lawe pronounceth sentence) then such as vnto him bee altogether. vnknowne. We are inioyned by a precept from the supernall prince, to haue a regard of our honest report: for that (sayth myne authour) shall continue with thée, when thousand treasures passing precious, shall vanishe and consume. Not many dayes agoe (as it was tolde me of a certaintie) which word beeing englished, noteth a man of temperance, conti nence, wisdom knowledge, honestie, and much vertue: such aone was that Sophronius, of whom he writeth. 
                  M. Sophronius (whether he be your sonne or no, I can not directly affirme) a young man, out of question, very well disposed, and one whose behauiours are answerable to his name, for he is wise, discrete, sober, and courteous. This yong Gentleman, rebuking some what sharply (I pray you let not my wordes styrre you to anger) your sonne for diuers abuses, after sundry admonitions &amp; friendly warnings giuen him, for the auoyding of vicious annoyances, and among al other his misdemeanours, for the filthy abusing of his body with courtesans and common strumpets, for his inordinate

belly cheare, and beastly surfetting, to the intent that he and all his friends might escape the gulfe of infamie, and kéepe their estimation from staines of reproch: procured vnto him selfe, by speaking the truth without dissimulation, a doubtfull inconuenience: namely, malice and mischiefe. For, anon after he had rebuked your sonne, with mild words and humilitie of spirite, (wherewith neuerthelesse his choler extremely boyled) to the ende he might appease this outragious perturbation in your sonne, he made a supper which might content any honest man (for the cheare was not so homely) albeit, the fare (peraduenture) was not fine enough, but ouer grosse, for the mouth of suche a delicate ruffian: to this supper your sonne being inuited, came accordingly, and like a malicious villaine, dissembling his canckred stomach, and poysoned hart, with hypocritical pretences, when the table did (as it were) sounde with pleasant merriments, when the cuppe went from hand to hand in most friendly fashion, and when the guestes, at that instant▪ gathered together, were in the middest of their pleasantest conceites, what doth the varlot your sonne, but (euen like a théefe that vseth violence for his auaile) Goodwill &amp; courteous interteinmēt cur rishly recompenced. with naked sword in hande, falleth vpon Sophronius suspecting no harme▪ as he was putting the pot to his lips ready to drinke, and wounded him to the very skul: yea, he had cleft his head in two péeces, if the pewter pot which was betwéene the sword and his head, had not broken the force of the blowe as it fell. Thus much I thought it good to certifie you of, that in perusing this Epistle, you may sée the shamelesse vsage of your sonne, and so prouide in due time, that to him selfe he bring not destruction, &amp; to his kinred an ignominious name▪

                  Hee writeth to Nicasio, a friend of his, vpon occasion of his young children, whome he is verie desirous to haue vertuously and learnedly

brought vp, and that hee may make his matter good, wherein the whole summe of his letter consisteth, he beginneth with the commendation of learning: shewing howe necessarie it is in the life of man: and what inconueniences insue the lacking of so singular an ornament. Lastly, he concludeth with an exhortation to the saide Nicasius, whome he moueth with diuers reasons, to satissie his minde, in that whereof he writeth.
               
               AMong all things that be in the vse and possession of man, deseruing commendation, Learning described and set out according to her ex cellencie and noblenesse. Learning (in myn
                     •…
                   opinion) is worthy of the chiefest prayse that can be giuen: by the benefite whereof, he in whome it is lodged is so lightened, that the darkenesse of ignoraunce can not make him stumble: besides that, it is a speciall helpe vnto him at all assayes, an excellent ornameut full of worship and honour, and suche a purueyaunce as shall neuer be spent or wasted. This noble gift of learning, euer since the foundation of the worlde, was bestowed on men, among whome it continued in degrées of ages &amp; posterities, neuer loosing any part of her brightnesse, but euen to these our days and times, hath reserued the same vndiminished. A thing it is, so necessarie in the life of man, that it can no more be missing, then can meate, whereby the body is nourished. For, if man representing an heaue

glorie and renoune as shoulde be ioyned to immortalitie. Betwéene these twaine, there is such affinitie, that the one is abased if the other be absent, bycause the one increaseth the others dignitie, when they be both present, and kéepe continuall companie. And, if I may speake what I thinke without offence, learning is the mother of vertue, bycause from her principally vertue doth procéede: Learning giueth vnderstanding of all thinges, as well of heauenly preceptes and Oracles, as also of all other sciences by y• wit of man inuented, out of which, as out of a cleare and hoalesome spring, we can drawe nothing but that which is vertuous, but that whiche is honest, but that whiche in all respectes is allowable. And, to the intent you may not be ignoraunt, what credite and worshippe is wonne by learning, the next way is to consider the contrarie, that is to say, what discommodities followe ignoraunce: for the nature of opposites is such, that the one by the other is made manifest. Ignoraunce is suche an impediment in man, from attaining those benefites whiche tende to his speciall behoofe, as a greater can not lightly bée named: this bréedeth suche blindnesse in him, that he is vtterly voyde of that iudgement, whiche maketh distinction betwéene thinges to bée desired, and thinges to bée auoyded: it taketh away the right vse of election and choyce: it maketh him vnacquainted with ciuilitie: it ingendreth in him rusticalitie or clownishnesse: it maketh him vnméete metall for the impressions of vertue: it maketh him vnfit for good companie: it doeth kindle in his mynde, forgetfulnesse of him selfe: yea, the greatest duetie of all other, is, by ignoraunce, withdrawne from him, and that is the knowledge of God, from whome he receiued the incōparable grace of his creation: finally, what enormities be there, 
                     〈◊〉
                   ignoraunce doth (as it were) pile them vp one vpon another, whereby all abilitie, to compasse that whiche is praiseworthy, and commendable indéede, is brought to naught, and quite turned out of possession. But the commodities of learning, are not only manifolde and diuers, but they are also singular and necessarie: sithence, in consideration of it selfe,

it is soone gathered, what a treasure it is, and howe expedient the happye hauing of the same is, not onely for that it procureth priuate profite, but also bycause the whol

The innocent is not defended. The oppressed persones cause is not supported. Artes and sciences are not mainteined. Finally, nothing that maketh for the profite of the people, is regarded: and these bée the inconueniences that ignoraunce ingendereth, with an infinite number more, too tedious to recount. O what In the commendation &amp; aduauncemēt wherof none can speake suf ficiently. an excellent thing, therefore is learning, whereby all these disorders are redressed, all these abuses abolished, and reformation of thinges amisse, introduced, and set in sure possession. By learuing, the common wealth is rightly gouerned. By learning, the true vse of lawes and statutes, are executed. By learning, the Prince is taught to fauour his people: the subiectes to bee loyall to their souereigne. By learning, due order is obserued in all offices. By learning, domesticall affaires, housholde matters (I meane) are well gouerned: children vertuously instructed: the whole familie well prouided and seene vnto. By learning, men of meane condition growe in countenaunce, and by the credite whiche they get by their knowledge, are aduaunced to degrees of honour. Learning maketh hard thinges easie.
                  
                  Learning maketh doubtfull thinges perceiuable. Learning is a comfort in aduersitie. Learning keepeth men from waxing insolent in felicitie: yea, and to be short, then is the possession of learning most pleasaunt and profitable, when a man is solitarie, and (as it were) forsaken.

                  THE ARGVMENT.
                  In this Epistle following, it is Macropedius his desire to set downe a perfect platfourme of a prince▪ wherein (vnder the person of Alexander, whome hee comme

Hee beginneth first of all, with the infancie of Alexander, which ministred manifest and manifold probabilities, of things which came afterwards to passe. He proceedeth with his yonger yeres, and declareth how he was then disposed. Lastly, hee concludeth with his estate when hee came to the possession of the kingdome, after his father Philippes deceasse: in al these digressions, and discourses, vnder the example of Alexander, shewing howe a prince ought to apply him selfe, if he intende to be famous, &amp; after his death, yet to liue among people.
               
               
                  ALexander * king of Macedonia (whom I haue determined,Whose name is so noble, &amp; his deedes so renouned, that who hathe heard least of his fame, may sone iudge of his inconquerable valiauntnesse. aboue al other Princes and Emperors of his time in the worlde, to praise to your maiestie, my most gracious souereigne, and that in fewe words, least I should séeme too tedious, in recounting his worthinesse, whose noble déedes, giue a sounde, lowde enoughe to his commendation,) descended of the loynes of Philippe, who possessed the Macedonishe Monarchie, nexte before Alexander his sonne, and lawfull successour.

an honourable house, to haue princes to his parents, to be a Gentleman borne, to haue this title or that of dignitie, bycause (as you say) not the place where a man is borne, nor the stocke from whence he draweth his descent, shoulde so muche commende a man, as his owne vertues, and inwarde qualities of his mynde, wherby he is indéede highly aduannced: heare therfore that which you can not choose but praise excéedingly, and not lightly regard like smoake or shadowes. This Alexander, euen in his infācie gaue many and the self same most assured significations of excellent giftes, naturally ingraffed in him: yea, and aboue all other, of prowesse and magnanimitie he shewed manifest proofes, insomuch, that the Macedonish

Touching the order of his education, histories most plentifully make sundrie and straunge declarations: For, he was not onely trayned in exercises of actiuitie, but also in the knowledge of sciences liberall, and specially in Khetorique and Philosophie: then which two necessarie stayes, the first seruing the bodie, the second seruing the mynde, nothing for a king or noble man more conuenient. In actiuitie he did excell (considering his person, and his descent): For it is sayde of him that in running he was singular, and in ryding not to be amended: and though his father Philippe, in this laste qualitie, did weare (as they say) the golden spurres, yet his sonne Alexander did better deserue them, sithence his knowledge in that Art, was (as it séemed) much more assured, and his cunning groū
                  ded vpon better experience. As for other properties to the bodie belonging, it is no question to be asked, whether he had them or no: For, it is not an vnlike reason, that he, in whome the greatest and the best thinges were to be founde, shoulde want the lest and the baser. Concerning his person, his complexion, his proportion, and suche like things requisite in a noble man, they did al concurre in him, and nothing did lacke y• might make him amiable. He was ruddie coloured, much like the damaske rose, not only in his face, but throughout al

and euery part of his body: insomuch that whosoeuer looked vppon him, and beheld his countenance, they might wel meruaile at the vniformitie that nature kept, in frameing so goodly a creature. His complexion was of the perfectest, and soundest, &amp; as for his proportion and making, there was nothing in him that was out of square, but euery ioynte and limme, both in measure and in place, verie formall, and passing hansome. This Alexander commended for the ornaments of his minde. 
                  Alexander, as hée was furnished with externall giftes, beautifying and well beséeming his bodie: so his minde was garnished with all maner of vnderstanding. For, as hée was a Prince of rare renowne, so had hée to instruct him, a Philosopher without peere, (Aristotle I meane, of whose fame al places of learning doe ring at this day) who taught him not onely morall preceptes touching humanitie, but other secrete sciences, which hée did impart but to a verie fewe, the same being special persons, among whom Alexander was one. O happie Prince whose lucke it was to haue such a maister: and O no lesse fortunate Philosopher, in whose lapp the lott fell to haue so noble a scholer. No doubt, this was the Gods foreappointment: For, as He meaneth Alexander the king: and Aiistotle the Philosopher. these twaine were incomparable, in cōsideration of the ornaments, wherwith they wonne immortall memorie: so neither of them lost their labour, not Aristotle in teaching, nor Alexander in lear ning, but the one and the other did reape conuenient profite. But what néede I heape vpp so many words in this matter, my penne hath not the power to paint out that puisaunt Prince, in such liuely colours as hee deserueth. For it passeth my capacitie to drawe out his portrayture in suf ficient liuelynesse. 
                  Lysippus the cunning ingrauer must be sent for: and Appelles the famous limmer must be fett, to accomplish this curious peece of woorke. Wee had neede of a Cicero or a Demosthenes, both tryed Rhetoricians, to sett him out with their blasing eloquence. Maro and Homer must take in hand to write in heroicall Uerses, y• vertue and noblenesse of him, whose worthinesse when I examine, I see such oddes, betweene the maiestie of his person, and the homelinesse of mine inuention, that I thinke it more auailable to kepe silence, and so auoyde blame, then by saying litle, and y• same super

To pretermitte his infancie, to let slippe his yonger yeres, both which were neuer destitute, of most honourable behauiours, and to come to his riper age, to come to that time wherein he gaue singular manifestations of his valliantnesse, which was neuer seperated from policie, it is a world to cōsider y• victories which he obteyned, to recount the countries which he subdued, to number vp y• people whom he drue to his subiection, to make rehersal of his straung aduentures, finally to declare the manifold wayes which lay wyde open vnto him, to good fortune, and the getting of euery thing, according to his owne will, whereby be purchased that rare title of Empyre, to be called

might flourish throughout all posterities. This citie he called after his owne name, which he built in such a plott of land, as a better, neither for pleasauntnesse, nor commoditie, might be chosen in all that region. Thus procéeding from wor thinesse to worthinesse, from renowne to renowne, mounting as it were by steppes, he became so famous, that all the world heard of the déedes of Alexander, counting him rather a God, then a man. So He draweth to his conclusion, wherein he maketh an application of that which is before spoken then your Grace may sée by these confused and disordered discourses, packt together in praise of a right praise worthie Prince, what a valliaunt spirite hee was directed withal in al his aduentures. How farre he was to reuolt from manhoode, no not when hee was in extremitie of daunger, but withstanding all inconueniences, thoroughe the good guiding of vertue, and the fauour of fortune, that neuer failed, hee purchased a name of noblenessé, which remayning in the registers of many Chroniclers and writers, may serue for an incitation, or incouragement to other kings and Princes, to followe his steppes in puisaunce and martiall excercises, though their lucke be not like his, nor the successe of their labours so fraught with happinesse. Nowe, to ende with that, wherein I should haue begunne, namely, the ornamentes of his minde, which proued him a noble gentleman in déede: it is manifest in all that was written of him, how studious and painefull he was, to be seene in the knowledge of the sciences liberall, and no lesse earnest and desirous to put that in experience, wherein he was instructed.

In the mysteries of nature he laboured so diligently, being taught of Aristotle, that there was kindled in him such a meruailous delight, that he could not abide, others to be communicants and partakers of that which hee knewe, but himselfe to haue the vnderstanding of

that onely and alone, whereof others should be ignoraunt. In the art of Physick he did profite wonderfully, not in that only which consisteth in speculation, but in that also which is altogether occupied in practise &amp; experience: in so much that when he was but sixtéene yeares of age, he was able to doe such things, as men of greater age, and longer practise, could not compasse, neither by knowledge nor cunning. Thus your Grace séeth the expresse picture of a prince, to whose pathes I would wish you directe your footestepps, if you meane to be a partaker of his praise.

                  A letter of imitation, made, in Suasorio scribendi genere, wherin Hegendorphinus goeth about by counsell and reason drawne from that which is dishonest, from that which is discommodious, from that which is hard and laborious, from that which is not necessarie, from that which is wicked, from that which is daungerous, and from that which is vnpossible, to winne his friends minde, from the trade of a merchant, and to frame himselfe to some facul

It is reported vnto me, that you meane to be a merchaunt venturer: I am sorrie that you should so employ the time and your labour, yea I would (if I could) disuade you from this intent. Consider with your selfe that your substaunce and wealth is not verie great, and therfore you cannot deale franckly in traffique: and surely, the trade of merchandise, except it bée sumptuous and costly (according to the authoritie of Cicero) it is lightly to be regarded: yea it is to be thought a kind of pedlarie exchange, to buy that at the merchants hand, which shortly after is set to open sale: what gaine or aduauntage doe they reape by their chopping, chaunging and intercourse of traffique, vnlesse they lye most odi

you are like to loose them and your life likewise, in the swelling waues: you are in peril of Pyrates and Rouers to spoyle you: of cuttethrote théeues and knaues by lande to robbe and take them from you: what should I talke of the stormie shoures that you must suffer in your iourney or voiage: what shoulde I talke of thunder, lightning, blustering blastes of windes, hayle, and other tempestes, whereunto you be subiect when you are abroade. I wil say nothing of the labour that is emploied in bargaining: of the toile in packing: of the paine in shipping, of the care in conueying your wares and merchandise home to your owne house. These inconueniences wel considered, it is great meruaile, if you abhorre not the trade of a merchaunt, as muche as you abhorre an Adder or Toade. But A supposed obiectiō wher to foloweth immediatly after a fitt resolution or answer. peraduenture the gayne that ariseth by occupying, pleaseth you marueilous well, so that you thinke it in no wise to be mislyked. But weighe with your self on the other side, wt what drudgerie it is gotten, with what small regarde of vpright dealing, honestie or conscience. For, you buy a thing good cheape, for a small price, and in manner a trifle: you sell the same againe to your Brother too déere and out of reason. Sée I pray you, is this kinde of gaine to be liked? is it to be commended? Nay, is it not to be detested, is it not to bee abhorred, hated and despised? what if you loose by one kinde of ware, or twoe, more then you shall recouer againe in manie? what if you haue not monie for present and readie payment, whereby you are forced (because of credit and forbearaunce) to giue a greater price, for that whiche you buy, then you take by their vtteraunce, yea, many times it commeth to passe, that in thus bargaining you are so farre from being a sauer, that you are a great looser. And what if it so chaunce (as peraduenture it may) that moste men buy suche ware as you want, whereby your merchandise lye vpon your hande, in your storehouse vnfolde: where is your gaine become nowe in these harde cases? To conclude, what neede (in Gods name) haue you, to giue your selfe to suche an vncertaine trade, so daungerous, bothe in consideration of losse of goods,

and in respecte of losse of life in like manner? What man, are you not As i

               Why do not you apply your selfe, to some one kinde of professiō, or other, wherin there is certaintie &amp; stay of liuing? as for example, Physicke, or the Law, which of the twaine you do best like? By these you shall soone and safely mount to be riche and woorshipful, whereafter▪ I knowe you hunger and thirst, like to one that is famished for want of necessarie sustenaunce: wherfore, if you meane, that I shall continue towardes you, mine accustomed fauour and fréendshippe, chaunge this your perillous purpose, and determine otherwise to shifte in the worlde.

For (saith he,) looke what our bodies be, when the soule hath forsaken them, euen that is a Citie, wherein are no Lawes: these lawes, are to the common wealthe (as it were) members, limmes, ioyntes, sinowes, veines, bloude, soule and spirit, the vse wherof wanting in a Citie, no good can insue. Lysten yet a litle further, and heare what the same Oratour saieth, in his Plée for Caecinna: There is nothing, that ought to be mainteined with suche care, diligence, and circumspection, in any Citie and incorporation, then the ciuil Law: which being abolished and put to silence, what man is there that can haue certaine knowledge, what is his owne right, and what is anothers interest? The ciuil lawe laboureth wholy to this end, namely that euery Citie be brought into suche good frame &amp; order, as a better can not be deuised: so affirmeth mine authour Alcinous. Loe, nowe you sée the necessitie of the ciuil Lawe. As for the credite, the countenaunce, the fauour, the estimation, and the honour whiche it doeth bring, who is there but is able to testifie?

studying the ciuillawe? Nay rather, what canne be more easily learned, especially of you, in whome is suche ripenesse of learning? Here vnto is to be added, as not vnwoorthie the consideration, that the whole substaunce of this science, is conteined in certaine bookes, not infinite and innumerable, so that it is but a kinde of pastime for you, to atteine the knowledge of the same with perfection (which you can not but doe, if you apply your minde thereunto) whereby you may in time, growe to be a seconde Scaeuola: in the studying of this Art, this caueat muste bee had, namely, to take vnto you one certaine writer: you must not doe, as a great many doe in these dayes, who whyles they are buisie with this booke of lawe, and that booke of lawe, following the interpretations and notes of diuerse men, they themselues be vncertaine whiche chiefly to immitate, and their counsel, in the meane while, is no furtherance to their clientes. To be shorte, in the vnderstanding and perfecte knowledge of the Lawe, there is a certaine swéetnesse and delectation to be gathered. For (that I may vse the words of Cicero) if any man conceiue pleasure in the studie of forreigne and straunge thinges, let him haue recourse to the Ciuil lawe, let him searche the Priestes registers, let him looke vpon the twelue tables of antiquities, whereby the auncient customes of the Romanes, their diuerse kindes of exercises, and their trade of life are discouered: and hee shal finde much and manifolde matter, in the which he may be delighted. Go too then: sithence there is no facultie, then the ciuil lawe more honest, none more necessarie, none more profitable, none more easie, for end, none more pleasaunt: you shalbe counted as very a dawcocke and dizzarde as euer was This was not Corocbus the Athenien, of whom Plinie lib. 7. cap. 56. but the same whome Virgil speaketh

                  THE ARGVMENT.
                  He setteth downe an example, how to write an epistle in demonstratiuo genere, concerning the commendation of some worthie and famous deed. The places, from whence, he boroweth his reasons, are these. From that whiche is honest and honourable, from that whiche is harde and 
                        •…
                      karse venturable. &amp;c. All which belong to the confirmation of his purpose.
               
               MAny are the Noble déeds of armes of the Romanes, but among all other, this carieth away the pearle of praise &amp; renoune: that Of whose valiauntnesse diuerse authours haue written: and among the rest Valerius Max imus. 
                  P. Decius, for the preseruation of his countrie whiche was in irrecouerable daunger, offered his owne life (then which nothing in the world more swéet and precious) to a gaping gulffe, &amp; that of a voluntarie motion, to bee swalowed vp and deuoured. For, what could hee attempt sauouring of more honestie and honour, in consideration, either of his priuate estate, or in respect of the whole body of the common wealthe? In consideration of his owne priuate person: because it is no small argument and token, of a couragious harted man, of his owne accorde, to pushe vpon the pykes of death: because it is a manifest testimonie, of a valiant spirit, not to loue life, (then whiche among men nothing more déere,) but to forsake it, &amp; that moste willingly, that others by his death might inioy the benefite of life. He did not put himselfe into this horrible aduenture, vppon temeritie and rashnesse: but being warned so to do by a vision in his sléepe, or rather beeing so admonished by reuelation from heauen, he was not wayward to shew himselfe conformable to such forceable representations. In respect of the whole Common wealthe: because it can not but be honest and honourable, that a good and vertuous man dyeth, for the deliueraunce of his countrie, from an inconuenience. Let vs procéede

and consider what commodities did redounde to the Common wealthe, by this his déede of valiauntuesse. He saued the life of many a Noble Duke: The fruites and commodities which insued the valiant death of P. Decius. he wrought the safegard of many a conquerous Capteine: he sente home the armie with victorie and triumphe: to the Romanes hee purchased euerlasting renoune: for ende, to his owne selfe, he wonne a name of immortal maiestie. He may (of right) chalenge to him self this singular title, to be called Pater Patriae, The father of his Countrie. What should I here stand in rehersing the daunger of the enterprise, what should I doe spending the time, in putting you in minde of the hardnesse of the aduenture? Howe terrible a thing it was, that he so couragiously attempted, you may gather by the circumstaunces. As who said: there is none but thinketh and persuadeth himselfe that life is passing sweet. What man is there but loueth his life? &amp; good reason: neuerthe lesse, what is he among a mylliā, that is not surprised with sorrowe, when hee séeth that soule and body must bee separated? yea, this parting in sunder, maketh the valiaunt mans heart to quake and tremble. Howebeit, this Noble Gentleman, vnderstanding by reuelation, that if he enioyed life, the whole common wealthe was like to be maruelously molested, did chuse rather, of his owne life to make a resignation, then that his countrie, whiche he moste tenderly loued, should fall in the gréedy iawes of deuouring desolation. And specially lustie Gentlemen &amp; gallant Courtiers, who should be a spectacle and patterne to the rest. All noble harted men therefore, setting before them, this worthie fact of Decius, let them put in practise some parte of his prowesse, if they meane to be partakers with him, of his perpetuall renoune.
               Fare you well.

and priuate preceptes tending to iudgement and wisedome: yet notwithstanding, many of them were lost, but howe many, it is vncertaine. The Epistles of A darke &amp; mystical Philosopher, crab bed &amp; harshe, yet profound and learned in writing. 
                  Seneca are full of Philosophie. The Epistles of Plinie are necessarie for vse and exercise: bothe in consideration of mennes priuate buisinesse, and in respecte of affaires tending to the weale publique: neuerthelesse in bothe pointes, because Cicero is the better, I count him the rather of the twaine to bee chosen. Plinie in his Epistles, is short, pleasaunt, readie, abounding with apt, sententious clauses, and merueilous conuenient, for quicke witted youthes to reade and peruse, when they sende letters one to another for practise sake, sauouring of an eloquent veine, thoughe the matter and Argument be not so weightie: among the Graecians there are found some, whose Epistles are read here and there, in diuerse writers volumes, among whome Lucianus is one, whose Epistles are So are they also shorte breefe, and compendious plaine and easie: and the Epistles of Philostratus, whiche are fuller of painted wordes, then beséemeth the matter wherein he is conuersaunt. The Epistles of them bothe, to say the very trueth, are vaine, trifling, and seruing to small purpose. The Epistles of A christian Philosopher, of Pentapolis in Africa, president of Ptolemais. &amp;c. Suidas. he was a great writer 
                  Synesius, are not a litle laboured in, and chiefly for Metaphors, whiche hee moste vseth. There are also Epistles of Basilius, Gregorius, and Libanius, and many more, bréefe and wittie (I must néedes confesse) but yet more méete for common Schooles, and men to reade for pleasure, when they haue nothing whereaboutes to be occupied: then fitte otherwise in matters of weight and importaunce. But let the Graecian writers passe, and let vs come to the Latines. After Caius Plinie, by succession of time, were many Christian writers, not onely more learned then the residue of their profession, but excelling all other whatsoeuer without controuersie. Auncient Fathers of the Church, epistoliographers, or writers of epistles 
                  Tertullian is mysticall, obscure, darke and harde in his methode of writing. Cyprian is not so doubtful and intangled in his style, though hée were of the same Countrie and Region. Augustine is somewhat

smoother then the other twaine, but not so eloquent and curious. Hieronymus is pathetical and vehement, as thoughe hee seemed to be alwayes directing his talke to Iudges, sitting vppon matters of life, and deathe.
               
                  Ambrosius is somwhat milder and nothing so earnest: in some places, neuerthelesse perplext and cumbersome to bée vnderstoode. Symmachus, neither by the hautinesse of his Argument, nor yet by the finenesse of his phrase, coulde winne fame and credite with Or with them that suc ceeded him from age, to age, by degrees of times. his posteritie. Sydonius Apollinaris Aluernas, is so enigmaticall, so darke and mystie (as I may terme it) that a man can searse tell where to finde out his meaning: in so muche that hée obteined not the fauour and well liking of his hearers, because (in déede) he deserued no such benefite. A long time after these, Franciseus Petrarcha, appeared as it were a bright shineing starre, in thicke and palpable fogges: this man is somewhat long and tedious, curious also therewith all, and not voide of difficulties, drawing to his methode, very many obseruations out of rustie and mouldie antiquaries. After him succéeded Gasparinus: who (among many other seniours) was the firste that sette penne to paper, in Italie, to write latine Epistles: whose letters, euen for this cause, deserue to be read, because they are reckoned in the number of them that be learned. After this man followed diuerse others, a

The epistles of Franciscus Picus, althoughe they are not fully so sine and eloquent as his Unckles, yet in consideration of their style, they are not to be dispraised, because it is good and not blame worthie: and in respecte of the weightie sentences, which he doeth vse, they deserue to be cōmended: but this man lacking luck, did also lacke wel lyking. Rodolphus Agricola, if he had amended his owne doings, if his owne works had fallen vnder his correction, he might haue worne the wreath of worthines with the chiefest, and the best, amonge the auncient writers: and why? Because of the soundnesse of his knowledge: the déepenesse of his learning: and the perfectnesse of his iudgement. Wée sawe (of late yeares) the epistles of Ioannes Capnio, both Or, in the glosse of their glorie, and the blemish of their beautie: that is, when they were most famous, and when the prosperous vpspring of other writers was an occasion that his wonted worthinesse withe red and wasted. bredd (as a man may say) and also buried: the common consent of the learned sort, did so much mislike them that they did quite condemne them: howe then could they continue longe aliue? Nay, how could they but quickly dye? for, ere many monethes were expyred, they grewe out of credite. Christophorus Longolius, béeing too too curious in imitation, marreth the readinesse of his naturall inuention. Hée

hath many of Ciceroes words, which whether he obserue of a good meaning, or for a fashion, it remayneth to be decided as a case of doubt? This is once true, the sense of his epistles may be amended, and made better &amp; sitter for his phrase, because in small matters he vseth great and thumpiug words, wherin is no good agréement. For, it is not sufficient and enough for him, with excéeding diligence to imitate the woords and y• phrase of Cicero, except he had also expressed Cicero in all other points. By this Allegorical speach he meaneth nothing else, but that Lōg. tooke more vpon him, thē he was able to performe in imitating Tul lie.

Erasmus is easie, plaine, perceiuable, and neuer swaruing from his accustomed veine. * Budeus is delighted in a newe, straunge, and vnusuall order of writing, which is more méete to be wondered at, then to be followed. The epistles of S. Paule, are too loftie, to mysticall, to déepe, and profound, so that it is not séemely for vs, to measure them by our iudgement. And thus haue I runne about a round row of writers, and haue shewed wherein they are to be marked: it remaineth to choose the best approued, &amp; to let the other alone as lesse necessarie.

But into the daungers of those times, vppon a soudaine, I am tumbled, which haue not onely cut off all libertie of cōming vnto you, but haue also not giuen me so much leasure as to send: with the allegation of which probable causes, although I did suppose my selfe not inexcusable, and that you could not but admit such impedimentes as, I might not withstand: yet thus much be you persuaded off, and well assured, that the report which our friende Whome in the beginning of his epistle he nameth.

            The last extract of Epistles, belonging to this Panoplie: out of M. Gualter Haddon, and M. Roger Aschame: Gentlemen of late memorie, for their rare learning and knowledge, verie famous.

                  THE ARGVMENT.
                  This Epistle sent to the Duke of Northumberlande, was written in the name of the whole vniuersitie of Cambridge: wherein occasion is taken, first of all to commende the Dukes worthynesse, both by lande and sea, testified. In consideration whereof, together with a certaine hope conceiued of his courtesie and gentlenesse, they offer and giue him, with one consent and agreement, the office of the Chauncelourship: (for, if that bee not the sense of the wordes, I can not tell what should be ment by their chiefe magistrate) for the receiuing wherof, he vseth diuers persuasions and reasons.
               
               
                  GOD hath inriched you (Right noble Duke) both with the excellent with goodly vertues, to the increasing of your honour and noblenes. ornaments of mynd, and also with gracious giftes belonging to the bodie: he hath aduaunced you to high honour, and placed you in a degrée of singular dignitie, to the ende you might be a beautifying to the other parts of the common wealth. For youre industrie, your diligence, your valiantnesse, &amp;c. hath flourished both on

lande and sea, at home and abroade, in warre and in peace: in so much that there is betwéene your labours susteined on sea, a certaine strife and variaunce, with them that you haue indured on lande: and your domesticall commendations are at dissention with your forreigne praises, for superioritie: and the stormie skyrmishes of bloudsheading battell, O

It is not easie to iudge, whether in playing the part of a capteine in foughten fielde, or in discharging the office of a wise Senatour in court and counsell, Bycause in both, your excellencie appeareth, to the admiration of a great number. you expresse the more noblenesse. Wherefore, sithence the manifolde vertue wherewith you be adorned, spreadeth it selfe, bothe farre and neare: and opening vnto it selfe a passage throughout all and euerie part of the common wealthe, offereth to some full and flowing founteines: so to vs (as we hope) it shall be so fauourable, as to let the riuers of your bountie, runne to our behoofe: it shall vouchsafe (we doubt not) gouerne by grauitie and sage counsell: rule by wisdome and policie: defende, support, and mainteine, with authoritie: this our little (but learned and not lightly to be regarded) common wealth.

Furthermore, let vs fasten our selues vpon the sure anchor of this most certaine and infallible hope, that although we be ouerwhelmed, and as it were in manner sounke, in seas of miseries, though we be tossed too and fro with most outragious stormes and tempestes of troubles, incident to this wretched life: yet Death, the port or hauen of peace and quietnesse. death (being the port of peace and quietnesse) is neuer farre from vs in these daungerous extremities, by and through whose singular benefite, we shall be remoued out of the ruinous cotage, of this worlde fraught with vanities, into heauenly houses and most blessed abidings, where eternitie and euerlastingnesse reigneth, where we shall liue in all pleasantnesse, séeing, féeling, hearing nor tasting any thing whereat to be offended and grieued. In the meane space, God of his goodnesse, blesse you with perfect health and long life, to whome I commit you and all yours, what soeuer.

                  ¶ THE ARGVMENT.
                  Writing to M. Thomas Henneage, with whome he had speciall familiaritie, he beginneth his letter with an occasion taken of the beneuolence and kindenesse▪ which betweene them was not vntestified. He sayth that friendship must not be considered, according to the number and greatnesse of giftes: but after a mans minde and goodwill. He commendeth him for mainteining the memorie of his father in lawe, least in time he should be forgotten▪ by hauing his picture (as I thinke) in liuely proportion and

                     ioyed life. Finally, after a short commendation of his solitarinesse, compared with that wherein Scipio tooke pleasure, he concludeth.
               
               YOu owe me nothing (most déere and welbeloued friende) but loue and wel liking, wherein I would haue you my So

I like maruellous well of your solitarinesse, bycause it hath in it a certaine semblaunce of the solitarinesse wherein Scipio tooke pleasure, who was neuer more busie, then when he was best at leasure: or if you haue nothing wherein to be occupied, yet you escape many discōmodities of all sorts, whereto yong gentlemen a great number of your state and condition are subiecte.

                  The course of this epistle (wherein sundrie circumstaunces are touched about learning, and the commodities of the same, in one Gentleman of great fame and worthinesse, appearing:) giueth mee to coniecture, that the meaning of the writer was, onely to moue Syr Iohn Cheeke (to whome this letter was directed) to bee mindefull of the Vniuersitie of Cambridge, and vnto the same, to continue beneficiall. The reasons which hee vseth are all grounded vppon persuasion.

We do not cōmitt vnto you, the cause of one particular person, but all our causes in generall, wherein we hope, you wil bestow no lesse labour, then either you ought in our behalfe to employ, or as we look for at your hands to be perfourmed.

that it may iucrease and haue sufficient furtheraunce. You are deceiued therfore, if you thinke this my meruailing is to be referred to any doubt concerning your abilitie, and not ra ther to pertaine to the praise of your witts, to the commendation of your knowledge, and to the aduauncing of your education and bringing vp. For, at these thrée things, namely, the worthinesse of your witte, the manner of your knowledge, &amp; the order of your bringing vp, made me woonder at you excéedingly. Al the praise that belongeth to your witte, it is your owne, by you it is purchased, of you it is possessed, because the vse and seruice consisteth in vertue: the cōmendation of your knowledge and learning, To you, for the readinesse of your wittes &amp; quick capacities: to him for his painefulnesse &amp; diligence in tea ching. &amp;c. is common both to you and to your instructour: for as he is therein to challenge a part, so you haue (in like manner) a portion. The praise of your education and bringing vp, is to be ascribed to your parents. For, in consideration of your witts, I haue séene therin a rare towardnesse, a voluntarie readinesse, &amp; a continuing painefulnesse. In your instructour or teacher, I haue allowed sufficient ablenesse, and also his faithfulnesse. In your Parents, I haue commended both their wisedome and their bountie: their wisedome, in that they were so well aduised, &amp; so circumspect, in Wherein appea

                  This Epistle consisteth of three members: the firste is gratulatorie, touching the person of himselfe and his freende, M. Mid. the seconde is petitorie in the behalfe of M.
