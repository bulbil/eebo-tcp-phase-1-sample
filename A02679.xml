            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

EXCOMMVNICATION
Publiſhed by the L. Archbiſhop of Dublin
Thomas Flemming aliàs Barnwell, Friar of the Order of
S. Francis, againſt the Inhabitants of the Dioceſſe of
Dublin, for hearing the Maſſes of Peter Caddell D. of
Divinity, and Paul Harris Prieſts, is proved not onely
injuſt, but of no validity, and conſequently
binding to no obedience.
            Jn which Treatiſe is alſo diſcovered that impious
plot and policy of the aforeſaid Archbiſhop and
his Friars in ſupplanting the Paſtors and Prieſts of the
Clergy, thereby to bring all into the hands of the
Friars, of whoſe diſorders and foule
abuſes (eſpecially in this
Kingdome) ſomething

what he hath done?

            To the judicious Reader.
            
               
                  EST tempus cacendi, &amp; tempus loquendi,
Eccleſ. 3. There is a time of
ſilence, and a time of ſpeaking. Eight
moneths of ſilence have now paſſed
ſince the following Cenſure was publiſhed,
in which ſpace as well Priests, as
people have expected a redreſſe of ſo
great wrongs. But ſince ſo long a time hath not wrought
that effect which was dayly looked for, we thought it full
time to expect no further time, but rather to breake off
ſo prejudiciall a ſilence, and better late, then never, to manifeſt
unto the world, as well the inſufficiency of that
ſentence, as the innocency of the cenſured, and if it bee
poſsible to undeceive ſuch as are poſſeſſed of the contrary.
Our delay in this affaire (I confeſse) hath bred us this
Inconvenience. That the contrary opinion being ſo long
ſucked in, hath ſo ſeaſoned the Potts, as hardly now will
they ſmell of any other liquor. Three ſorts of Readers (and
ſo the moſt) I doe exclude from this diſcourſe.
            
               1. First, ſuch as are careleſſe how the matter paſſeth among
us.
               2. Secondly, ſuch as are obstinate in the contrary opinion.
               3. Thirdly, ſuch as are not capable of reaſon when they
ſee it layde downe.
            
            
               
Onely to the fourth, anll the feweſt ſort of Readers is
this Apology addreſſed. (I ſay) for their onely ſakes,
who are willing to have ſatisfaction, and are capable
thereof.
            If any bee offended, That this our Apology or Defence
of our Innocency is publiſhed, and made common
to many. Let them conſider, that ſo was the Archbiſhops
Cenſure: And that to many moe, then into
whoſe hands theſe writings can come. For wee are perſwaded,
none will take the like paines to publiſh them
unto hundreds, and thouſands!, as the Excommunication
was thorough all the Oratoryes of Dublin,

Engliſh tongue, Let them conſider, that ſo was the
Cenſure: They both ſpeake one language. But you
will ſay, That this is made common both to Catholickes,
and Proteſtants, whereas the Excommunication
was onely communicated unto Catholickes. I ſay,
in this alſo they are alike. For as a matter made
publicke among the Proteſtants, can not be concealed
from the Catholickes; no more can any thing publiſhed
among the Catholickes be kept from the Proteſtants.

matter to reprove injuſtice, and to reprehend vice, then to
commit the ſame. Experience whereof we have had in
our late Appeale. Wee the Appellants having received
of the injudicious and partiall multitude, more rebuke
then they who were the Authors of all thoſe injuries, &amp;
greivances, of which, and of whom, we made complaint
unto lawfull Superiours. But as the world commends many

we cry for Iuſtice, and with our clamours will we fill
both the Heavens, and the eares of all lawfull Superiours
on earth; Thoughts have voyces ſufficient for the Heavens,

for the good of the ſoules of this my Dioceſſe,
I have thought expedient to forbid: and

to heare the Maſſes of Paul Harris, and of
Doctour Peter Cadell, and withall, from the

            THE
EXCOMMVNICATION
PVBLISHED BY THE L.
ARCHBISHOP OF DVBLIN
Thomas Flemming aliàs Barnwell, Friar of
the Order of S. Francis, againſt the Inhabitants
of the Dioceſſe of Dublin, for
hearing the Maſſes of Peter Caddell
Dr of Divinity, and Paul Harris
Prieſts, is proved not onely
injuſt, but of no validity,
and conſequently binding
to no obedience.
            
               FIrſt then, gentle Reader, give me leave
to lay downe theſe few Principles of
the Canon Law, as the grounds of
my following Diſcourſe.
            
               I. The firſt Principle is, That the
Cenſure of Excommunication
grounded upon an intollerable
error, is both injuſt and invalide, and ſo, obligeing to
no obedience, neither in for o fori, or in foro poli, as much
to ſay, neither in Law, nor Conſcience. Cap. Per tuas

And it is the common Tenent of all Doctors.
               
                  
II. The ſecond Principle is, That no Excommunication
juſt &amp; valid can be fulminated but for a mortall ſinne,
the ſame manifeſted, &amp; afore-hand forbidden under
paine of Excommunication, &amp; ſo alwayes accompanyed
with contumacy. Sot. in 4. diſtinct. 22. q. 1. art. 2.

ſeſſ. 25. de Reformatione cap. 3. And it is the common
Tenent of all Doctors.
               III. The third ground is, That Prieſts of the Hierarchy or
Cleargy, are bound to no further obedience unto
their Biſhop or Ordinary, then Canonicall. That is,
ſuch as the Lawes of holy Church preſcribe, and
which they promiſe in their Conſecration. vid. Ep.
               
               IV. The fourth is, That in all Legall and Canonicall proſequution
of cauſe or crime, the Defendant is to be called
unto his anſwer, &amp; convicted of what he is accuſed,
before he be ſentenced. Cap. Cum Paulis 191.

               V. The fifth ground is, That every man is to be taken, and
to be held for a good, a legall and an upright man, till
the contrary be proved againſt him. Regnla Iuris 8.
            
            Theſe five Principles of the Canon Law, I place as ſo many
lampes, or lanthernes in the entry of my following Diſcourſe,
to enlighten the Reader with more eaſe and facility
to paſſe thorough the ſame. In which Treatiſe or Diſcourſe,
I intend by Gods aſſiſtance to proove, That the aforeſaid

Cenſure of Thomas Flemming aliàs Barnwell, L. Archbiſhop
of Dublin, &amp; Friar of the Order of S. Francis, is of the worſt
ranke of Excommunications, &amp; of ſo defective a nature, as
beſides the Injuſtice thereof, it laboureth of a meere Nullity
or Invalidity, and conſequently can produce no other effect,
then neglect, or contempt.
            
               CAP. I.
               The first Argument againſt the Excommunication.
               
                  MY firſt Reaſon or Argument by which it is manifeſt,
that the aforeſaid Excommunication is
not onely injuſt, but invalid, is, for that it is
grounded upon an intollerable error. But how
ſay you is that proved? Mary as thus. A ſentence publiſhed
without any cauſe, or reaſon, containeth an intollerable error.

10. num, 9. Reginaldus lib. 9 num. 106. and ſo commonly.
               But ſuch is the aforeſaid Cenſure publiſhed without cauſe
or reaſon, as ſhall be proved.
               
                  Ergo, it containes an intollerable error.
               Now for the Minor of this Syllogiſme; namely, That the
precedent Cenſure was publiſhed without cauſe or reaſon,
I thus declare. The cauſe of the Cenſure layde downe, as appeareth
by the Tenor thereof, is the inſolencie and obſtinate
diſobedience of the two aforenamed Prieſts, &amp; that without
hope of amendment, to the great diſedification of his flock.
               To which it is anſwered by the aforeſaid venerable Prieſts
in this their Apology or defence. That this cauſe was never
proved againſt them, &amp; therefore is no cauſe at all, by that
rule of the law, Cauſa non probam, non eſt cauſa, A cauſe not
proved, is no cauſe. 24. q. 3. de Illicita. and is manifeſt by the
light of reaſon. For they alledge that to this day they have

never bin accuſed, much leſſe convicted of any ſuch diſobedience
or obſtinacy. Nay they ſay further, That as yet they
never were cited before their Ordinary, to anſwer any matter
of diſobedience in all their lives whatſoever. Now then
forſomuuch as the Canon it ſelfe tells us, Quod publicum judicium
eſt inſtitutum, ut innocentia protegatur, &amp; culpa puniatur
2. q. 1. That publique Iudgments are therefore ordained, that
Innocencie may be protected, &amp; faults puniſh
                     •
                  d. And our
wiſe Law-givers obſerving, that this end and ſcope of the
law could not otherwiſe be attained, but by citing &amp; calling
to their anſwer, the parties ſuppoſed to be delinqu

                  g
them to their defence. Therefore was it ordained
by the Canons &amp; lawes of holy Church, that even in ſummary
&amp; moſt compendious p
                     •
                  oceedings, in which all ſolemnity
of law may be pretermitted, yet no Biſhop or Prelate
ſhould preſume to ſentence any of their ſubjects. Theſe or either
of theſe two maine pillars of all legall &amp; juridical proceeding
being neglected; namely, Citation &amp; Conviction,
as is above proved in the fourth Principle. And that in omiſſion
of both, or either of theſe two eſſentiall parts of all
lawfull proceſſe all ſentence &amp; publication of ſentence following,
is to be held ipſo fact, voyde, &amp; ſo Invalid in law, as
no appellation from ſuch ſentence ſhall be neceſſary to any
other court or ſuperiour. For ſaith the Canon: Quae contra
legem facta 
                        •
                     unt, pro infectis haberi debent. 25 q. 2. Imperiali. The
things that are done contrary to law, are to be accounted as
not done at all. Now then forſomuch as both theſe, namely
Citation &amp; Conviction, have b
                     •
                  n omitted by their Ordinary
Thomas Flemming aliàs Barnwell, L. Archb of Dublin, and
Friar of the Order of S. Francis. Tho ſetwo reverend Prieſts
doe alledge, that the ſentence of Excommunication following
&amp; fulminated againſt the Inhabitants of this Dioceſſe,
for hearing their Maſſes, is utterly voyde. For which ſo great
a wrong both to Prieſt &amp; People, ſatiſfactio
                     •
                   of honour and
dammages, in all law &amp; conſcience is due, they being in poſſeſſion
of a good name, of which they are not to be deprived,

till the contrary be proved againſt them: according to
that rule of the law, (which I placed in the beginning for
my fift Principle, &amp; is alſo the very law of God &amp; Nature:)
That every one is to be held a good &amp; a legall man, till he be
convicted of the contrary, And ſo much for my firſt Argument
or Reaſon, manifeſting the Injuſtice and Nullity of the
aforeſaid Excommunication.

is: That all Cenſures of the Eccleſiaſticall

the cauſe of ſuch cenſure. Concil. Lug.

                     od. in 6. which expreſſion of cauſe, is not onely to be
obſerved in denunciation of Excomunications already incurred,
but alſo to be incurred, in caſe the cauſe be not otherwiſe
notoriouſly knowne. For example, The Archbiſhop
of Millan excommunicates all ſuch Officers &amp; Wayters at
the city gat

                  s, as alſ

                   all citizens, who ſhal admit into their
houſes, ſtrangers, who bring not with them literas ſanitatis,
letters of health. This Excommu

                  ica
                     •
                  ion in time of peſtilence
&amp; mortality, is juſt &amp; valid, although it expreſſe no
cauſe. For why, the cauſe is apparant, the preſervation of the
Citty from infection in time of peſtilence. Yet ſay I, in caſe
there were no danger of infection, for that there is no fame
or report of any 
                     •
                  iagues abroad, it were no valid ſentence,
for want of intimation and expreſſion of a cauſe. And this
happens ſo often, as 
                     •
                  uch things are pr
                     •
                  hibited under cenſures,
which of themſelves are not unlawfull, but by ſome
accident, or circumſtance. And in this all agree.
               Now the afore-named Prieſts doe alledge in this their

Apology, That there is no cauſe at all layde downe in the
ſentence of the aforeſaid Excommunication, nor yet otherwiſe
manifeſt: for which want &amp; defect, they doubt not to
avouch it Invalid.
               But it will be ſaid unto the Minor of this Syllogiſme,
That there is a cauſe expreſſed &amp; nominated, yea and very
much inſiſted upon in the Cenſure, to wi
                     •
                  , obſtinate diſobedience,
continuall inſolencie, and that without hope of amendment,
to the great ſcandall and diſaedification of many
Catholiques, &amp;c.
               To which I anſwere, That Diſobedience is an univerſall
cauſe, &amp; hath many branches, ſpreading it ſelf farre &amp; wide
thorough the whole life of man. For example, there is diſobedience
unto God, and that in as great variety as there
be ſins &amp; offences againſt the firſt &amp; ſecond Table. There is
diſobedience unto the lawes of holy Church. There is diſobedience
unto the lawes &amp; edicts of Princes, to Prelates, to
inferiour Magiſtrates, to Parents, to Tutors, to Maſters of families,
to Pedagogues, &amp; to all lawfull Superiours, &amp; that in
an Ocean of matter &amp; circumſtances. Now then forſomuch
as neither vice nor vertue can be exerciſed but in their proper
particular &amp; individuall 
                     〈◊〉
                   No act of the Prieſts diſobedience
being heere m
                     •
                  ntioned, no cauſe of the Excommunication
is expreſſed, &amp; no cauſe, no cenſure. For it is a
ſaying as true as common, That qui ambulat in univerſalibus,
intendit decipere; He that walketh in univerſalities and generalities,
deſires to deceive.
               You know in your Civill &amp; Temporall Courts, If a man
be to be puniſhed either corporally, or by the purſe, his particular
fault is ſet before his eyes, yea and made manifeſt to
ſo many as pleaſe to take knowledge thereof. Is Titius an
offender? Is he a wicked man? This is not ſufficient to
doome him to puniſhment: And why ſo? becauſe there bee
many kindes of offences, many ſorts of wickedneſſe. Is Titius
a theefe, &amp; hath ſtolne? Neither is that ſufficient to cauſe
his puniſhment: And why? becauſe there be many ſorts of

ſtealths &amp; theeveries. But hath Titius ſtolne a piece of plate
of ſo mauy ounces; an horſe, or a cow of ſuch a valew, from
ſuch a man, ſuch a time, &amp; in ſuch a manner: O when Titius
is brought unto his tryall in open Court, &amp; is convicted of
his particular act &amp; crime, either by his owne confeſſion, or
proofe of witneſſe, then is Titius ſubject to the ſentence,
and to the execution thereof.
               Even ſo ſay I, diſobedience is a vice in univerſali, &amp; therfore
as not committable, ſo not puniſhable but in his particular
Act. For they that know any thing, know this: that
ſinnes cannot be committed neither in Genere, nor in Specie,
but in Individuo per Iudividuum. But heere in the cenſure
of the Archbiſhop, it is neither declared againſt whom, or in
what matter this diſobedience was, or of what nature, or colout
it is. The puniſhment is declared to be Excommunication,
but the cauſe of it hangs in the cloudes of univerſality:
and whether it will prove hayle, raine, or ſnow, no man
knowes but by divination.
               Now let any indifferent man judge, whether it be not a
moſt illegall, &amp; an exorbitant courſe of proceeding, for a
man to know his puniſhment, &amp; not his offence; to feele the
one, before he be convicted of the other? And ſuch is the
caſe of theſe R. Prieſts, who from time to time have demanded,
urged, &amp; required with all duty &amp; due reſpect of their
Archbiſhop, as alſo of his Councell of Friars: What this
their diſobedience was, againſt whom it was committed, in
what matter it conſiſted of, what nature it was of? And nothing
anſwered, but ſic volo, fit jubeo: or as ſometimes it
pleaſeth him to ſay: That he doth theſe things for cauſes
and reaſons onely knowne unto himſelfe.
               But if it were lawfull for Abraham, Moſes, &amp; Iob, to reaſon
with God Almighty: let me alſo with due reſpect aske
of you my L. Archbiſhop, whether this be not to open a
gap, &amp; to ſet wide the ſluces of a full inundation to all injuſtice
and impiety: I ſay, my Lord, to puniſh your ſubjects
for cauſes &amp; reaſons only knowne unto your ſelfe. For in ſo

doing, you ſeeme to erect a new tribunall, &amp; to bring in ſuch
a forme of judgment among us, as the world hath not yet taken
knowledge of, contrary to all lawes divine &amp; humane,
of God and man.
               For firſt we reade in Geneſis 3. when Almighty God was
to cen
                     •
                  ure our firſt Parents for their tranſgreſſion, he was
not contented with his owne knowledge, but he cited them
in perſon to appeare before him, ſaying; Adam, Vbi as?
Adam, Where art thou? charging them with their particular
diſobedience, in eating the forbidden fruit, contented
to heare what they could alledge in their owne defence, before
he deſcended to ſentence: yea, &amp; as a grave Author writing
upon that place, ſaith. Had not the devil bin ſentenced
&amp; damned before that time, he happily then had bin admitted
unto his defence and purgation.
               The like did God in the parricide of Cain, ſaying, Vbi eſt
Abel frater tuus? Geneſ. 4. Where is thy brother Abel? The
like he did in the deſtruction of the five Cities (notwithſtanding
his omniſcience) no doubt, to preſcribe unto man
a platforme of Iuſtice &amp; Iudgment. Deſcendam &amp; videbo, utram
clamorem qui venit ad me, opere compleverint, an non eſt
ita, ut ſ
                        ••
                     am. Geneſ. 18. I will goe downe (ſaith Almighty
God) and I will ſee whether they have done according to
the cry that is come unto me, or whether it be not ſo, that I
may know.
               So our Saviour in the proceſſe of the adulterous woman,
Mulier, Vbi ſunt qui te accuſabant? Iohn 8. Woman, where
be thine accuſers?
               So hath he foretold us, what ſhall be the forme &amp; proceſſe
of the laſt Iudgment, at what time the ſheepe ſhall be ſeparated
from the goates. Math. 25.
               And thus have you ſeene ſome few examples out of Scripture,
of Iuſtice exercited in Iudgment by God himſelfe.
Now as touching humane Iudgments, who can make queſtion,
but as Moſes made the Tabernacle according unto
that patterne which was ſhewed unto him by God himſelfe

in the mountaine, Exod. 25. So ought all humane Iudgments
to be ſquared according to the divine. Of many to rehearſe
ſome few examples.
               Such was the judgment of Salomon in the cauſe of the
two Harlots, about the quick &amp; the dead childe. III. Reg. 3.
               Such was the judgment of Daniel in the caſe of chaſt Suſanna.
Dan. 7.
               Such was the judgment of S. Peter in the matter of Ananias
and Saphira. Act. 5.
               And our bleſſed Saviour &amp; Redeemer in that his Arraignment,
where Injuſtice moſt of all did triumph in the ſeat of
Iuſtice yet was admitted unto his anſwer, ſaw his accuſers,
heard his forged crimes urged by his malicious enemies, &amp;
enforced againſt him by two falſe witneſſes, &amp; laſt of all received
his ſentence pronounced by the mouth of the unjuſt
Iudge Pontius Pilate. Math. 27.
               But theſe two venerable Prieſts (
                     〈◊〉
                   I confeſſe not in a
matter which concernes their lives) yet in a caſe which
ſome will ſay, is more to be eſteemed then life it ſelfe, to
wit, their honour and good name in the world, were condemned,
not cited to Iudgment, abſent, and 
                     〈◊〉
                  , at what
time it pleaſed my L. Archbiſhop and his Fryars to ſit upon
the Bench. And that which in all Iudgments, &amp; by the Law
of Nature ought to be the laſt &amp; the percloſe of the whole
proceſſe, was here the firſt, namely ſentence. For neither
themſelves, or any in the place where they live, did ſo much
as once ſu
                     •
                  pect any proceeding in any cauſe with them, or
againſt them, till ſentence was proclaimed, and that as publickely
as at the high Croſſe of Dublin: and themſelves condemned
of Diſobedience; but how? As I have ſaid, in termes
of univerſality: Of a Diſobedience wanting his exiſtence
or being of a particular act, or fact: Of a diſobedience without
father or mother, naked of all circumſtances; as time,
when; place, where; &amp; perſon, againſt whom. A ſingular judgment
I confeſſe, and, not much unlike unto that which they
ſay in ſome barbarous Countreyes is exerciſed: The man

firſt hanged, and then his cauſe examined. O Nicodemus, Nicodemu
                        •
                     !
Thou a Iew couldſt ſay, Numquid lex noſtra judicat
hominem? &amp;c. Iohn 7. Doth our law condemne a man before
he befirſt heard, and know what he hath done? But had
Nicodemus lived in theſe dayes among Chriſtians, he would
ſometimes have ſeen wrong, injury and oppreſſion, to have
ſit in the ſeat of Iudgment.
               I will then conclude this point with that ſaying of Feſtus
unto King Agrippa, in the behalfe of that great Apoſtle S.
Paul, when he was to be ſent priſoner unto C
                        •
                     ſar: Sine ratione
mihi videtur mittere vinctum, &amp; cauſas ejus non ſignificare.
Act. 25. It ſeemes unto me a thing unreaſonable, to
ſend a man bound, and not to ſignifie his cauſe. And is it not
thinke you, a farre more unreaſonable thing to thruſt the
people into the ſpirituall bondes and fetters of Excommunication,
and not to ſignifie the cauſe thereof? And I wonder
that our great Maſters in Iſrael, and you onely great
Couucellours of warre againſt the poore Clergy; my Lord,
I meane our Friars who profeſſe ſo great Schollerſhip,
would not adviſe your Hon: (who happily by reaſon of your
other imployments, cannot ſo well attend unto the ſtudy
of the Canons) what puniſhment that Biſhop incurres, who
excommunicates before the cauſe thereof be proved. See
then for this, the Councell of Paris, with Gratian 24. q. 3. De
Illicita. And I will for the eaſe of my Reader ſet downe the
words. De illicita excommunicatione lex Iuſtiniani Imperatoris
Catholici, &amp;c. As touching unlawfull Excommunications,
the law of Iuſtinian the Catholicke Emperour (which
law the Catholicke Church doth approve and obſerve) in
his 123. Conſtitution, cap. 351. hath decreed that no Biſhop
or Prelate excommunicate any perſon before the cauſe bee
proved, for which the Canons of the Church command this
to be done, and for his unjuſt attempt he ſhall ſo long abſtaine
from the ſacred Communion as ſhall ſeeme good unto
his Superiour. So that Councell. And it appeares by the
Canon, that ſuch Prelates incurve ſuſpenſion. See Ext
                        ••
                     de ſentent.

Excom. Sacro. So S. Gregory the great abſolved the Biſhop
Magnus, unjuſtly excommunicated by Laurence Archbiſhop
of Millan. See S. Gregory lib. 2. Epiſt. 26. And the
ſame Pope Gregory did puniſh Iohn a Biſhop, for inflicting
of unjuſt Excommunications. See for this the place above
cited, de illicita Excom. And let them conſider of this who
teach, that our Biſhops cannot erre in their cenſures. That
they muſt be obeyed in right and wrong, &amp;c. But I ſhall have
occaſion to ſpeake of that point hereafter.
               Forſomuch then as you ſee the Law tells us, that no Excommunication
can either be inflicted or incurred, before
the cauſe thereof be proved. Let me humbly intereat your
Hon: my very good Lord, for I ſuppoſe that you are neither
too old to learne, nor my ſelfe too yong to teach: Nor doe I
doubt, albeit I be inferiour to you in place and dignity in
Gods Church, that it will either miſbecome my profeſſion,
as being a Prieſt, nor my white haires, as now being Paulus
ſenex, even Paul an old man, to preach unto you. That as
well for the ſecurity of your owne conſcience towardes
God, as to avoyde the ſcandall and obloquy of the world,
as alſo puniſhment from the higher powers. That hereafter
you will either make the cauſe of your Cenſures as well
knowne and approved unto the world, as you doe your puniſhments,
or elſe the puniſhments as private unto your
ſelfe as the cauſes thereof. And ſo hoping your Hon. will
take the premiſſes into your conſideration, I will deſcend
unto the next point; which ſhal be to ſatiſfie ſome doubts, &amp;
to anſwer to certaine objections which may be made in the
behalfe of the Ordinary againſt my two former Arguments,
enforcing the Injuſtice and Invalidity of the Archbiſhops
cenſure.
            
            
               
               CAP. III.
               Certaine Objections in behalfe of the Archb. propounded,
and anſwered.
               
                  FIrſt then it may be ſaid in defence and excuſe of
the Ordinary: That the times are ſuch, as our
Prelats in this kingdome cannot obſerve any legall
or canonicall proceſſe or courſe of Iudgement
with their ſubjects, and therefore are conſtrayned to
proceed as they may. And that albeit they neither call the
Defendant unto his anſwere, nor admit of any proofe of
cauſe by witneſſe againſt them, they are to be borne withall:
Neceſſitas non habet legem, Neceſſity knowes no law, &amp;c.
               To which firſt I anſwere, That if the Catholicke Prelats
either have way by permiſſion of the ſtate, or take unto
themſelves ſo much boldneſſe, as to publiſh their ſentences
of Excommunication in their Chappels and Oratories after
Maſſe, as well by ſuch Pariſh Prieſts, as are placed in the Cittyes
and ſuburbes, as alſo by the Friars of ſo many Orders.
Than ſay I, How can they be excuſed in the pretermiſſion
of ilegall proceeding in that former part of Iuſtice, going
before ſentence. Namely calling the parties unto their anſwer,
examination of their cauſes, admitting of proofe pro
&amp; contra. For ſo much as all this may be performed with
much more privacy then the publication of ſentence can
be. The Cano is of holy Church requiring no greater a number
even in their moſt publicke and ſolemne proceedings
in court, then theſe 4. ſorts of perſons: 1. The Iudge 2. The
Plaintiffe: 3. The Defendant: and 4ly the Witneſſes: all which
neede not to be abo
                     •
                  e five or ſixe perſons at the moſt. That
Prelate then who can be ſo bold as to command his ſentence
of Excommunication to be publiſhed in the hearing of ſo
many hundreds, yea of thouſands, as my Lord Archbiſhop
Thomas Flemming, alias Barnwell hathdone, yea and from

time to time 1. publiſhed the ſame ſentence, leſt it ſhould
grow ſtale, and out of requeſt How can he in reaſon pretend
any feare of perſecution in granting a legall courſe of
proceeding, in which the preſence of ſo few (as hath beene
ſaid) is neceſſary. And therefore to doe the one, and to omit
the other, is but to ſleight Iuſtice, and to oppreſſe the Innocent.
And ſo much for the firſt anſwer.
               My ſecond anſwer is, That in caſe the times be ſuch, &amp; the
perſecution ſo great, as that thoſe eſſentiall parts of all legall
proceeding muſt of neceſſity be pretermitted, (I meane
Convention of the parties, &amp; Conviction by due proofe:)
I ſay then with that common Maxime of the law, Better an
Inconvenience, then a Miſchiefe; &amp; in ſuch caſe all ſentence
of puniſhment, publication, and execution doth likewiſe
ceaſe, and the guilty is rather to paſſe unpuniſhed in this
world, then the very ſyſtema of all Tribunalls to be ruinated,
&amp; Iuſtice depoſed from her Throne; for then it ſeemes to be
a caſe of a common calamity &amp; an inevitable neceſſity, putting
ſilence unto all lawes, &amp; better the Nocent be ſpared,
then the Innocent puniſhed.
               But ſee, &amp; note (gentle Reader) what uſe of the times, &amp;
what an excellent advantage the Ordinary makes unto himſelf
to compaſſe his own ends (I ſay, by fiſhing in theſe troubled
waters.) For whereas in France, Spaine, Italy, and thoſe
Countreyes where the ſpirituall ſword hath his free ſtroke
in all Tribunalls (ſupported &amp; maintained ſo often as is neceſſary
with the ayde &amp; aſſiſtance of the ſecular arme,) yet
all forme of due Iuſtice is punctually obſerved. Id enim poſſumus,
quod juſtè poſſumus; for that only can we doe (ſaith
the Law) which we may juſtly doe. But here in this Dioceſe,
all muſt be preſumed for the Ordinary, becauſe we live in a
mixt people, neere unto the State &amp; Magiſtrate of an other
profeſſion in Religion from us, no juridicall proceeding
muſt be held neceſſary, but that our Eccleſiaſticall Iudge may
lay about him at his pleaſure, in his cenſures &amp; puniſhments
of his ſubjects, without calling the parties before him to

their anſwer, without examination of their cauſe, without
conviction, &amp;c. So as what an Ordinary could not do where
the Church is eſtabliſhed, &amp; in his full ſtrength and vigour
againſt the pooreſt Prieſt of his Dioceſe here, under pretence
of a perſecution, and obſtacle of a free courſe of Iuſtice, he
ſhall moſt eaſily effect (I ſay) under the name &amp; cloake of
perſecution, more freely himſelf to perſecute, as at this preſent,
&amp; for ſome yeares paſt, the Clergy of this Dioceſſe hath
both ſeene &amp; felt, having endured a more bitter perſecution
from this their Biſhop &amp; his Friars, then from the temporall
Magiſtrate, though divided from them in matter of
Religion.
               Adde hereunto a ſecond advantage alſo, that this Archbiſhop
of Dublin makes of theſe times by a ſeeming and a
pleaſing correſpondency which he keepes (as he imagins
himſelfe) with the State. For he being a Friar, &amp; ſeeking by
all meanes to ſuppreſſe the Clergy, and to bring all into the
hands of the Regulars, I meane the Monks &amp; Friars, as well
Franciſcans, Capuchins, Dominicans, Auguſtines, Carmelits,
&amp; Ieſuits, (For ſcarce are there ſo many Prieſts of the Clergy
left in all this Citty, as there be Orders of Regulars therein
at this day.) And knowing that they of a contrary profeſſion,
can well endure that Prieſts either in their perſons, or in
their maintenance &amp; lively hood ſhould be ſtraitned &amp; ſuppreſſed.
And knowing alſo that it will not diſcontent the
Proteſtane Magiſtrate to have the people forbidden to heare
the Maſſes of Prieſts. He upon theſe preſumptions, ſupported
by the Counce
                     •
                  l of his Fryars, who are of more ſtrength
in this Citty then men would imagine) is animated to purſue
ſuch deſignes as of late he hath undertaken, knowing
that the lower the ballance of the Clergy deſcends, the higher
are the Fryars advanced, &amp; by driving of the people from
the Clergy, the more of neceſſity muſt they &amp; wild they depend
on the Friars. But this wiſedome (doubtleſſe) is not
ſpirituall, but carnall; not from above, but earthly; ſavouring
not of the Holy Ghoſt, but of ambition, of temporal means,

and of the belly. And ſo being a Councell, not of God, will
come to nothing, though for a time (by never ſo ſtrong a
faction) ſupported.
               A ſecond defence of the Archbiſhops proceedings, is
this, &amp; which by our Friars is much put on foot, eſpecially among
the common people: That the Biſhop is to be obeyed
in all things, yea in right &amp; wrong, as ſome teach: And ſhall
the foot judge the head? the ſubject the Magiſtrat? the ſheep
the Prelate? &amp;c.
               To the firſt part of this popular argument ſo much inſiſted
upon, I anſwer, that if it be ſpoken merrily, it may paſſe
for a jeſt; but if ſeriouſly, it is flat hereſie; namely, that 
                     〈◊〉
                  
Biſhop in right and wrong is to be obeyed.
               For the ſecond part, which thorough the perſwaſion of
the Friars, is in every old wifes mouth; &amp; the ſecond word
of every Artiſan &amp; Tradeſman, That the ſheep are not to examine
or queſtion the ſentence of their Pre
                     •
                  ate: the ſubject
of the Magiſtrate. I anſwer, that albeit indeed the Inferiour
can not reverſe or correct the judgment of his Superiour, &amp;
much leſſe may he puniſh him for the ſame (becauſe he hath
no juriſdiction or power over him.) Yet by the Friars good
leave, the Inferiour may examine, may queſtion &amp; diſcuſſe
the judgment &amp; ſentence of his Superiour, both in his own
&amp; other mens caſes: yea &amp; if the Inferiour, or Subject, doe
finde either by his owne learning, or by help of ſuch as are
ſeen in the knowledge &amp; profeſſion of the Lawes, that a ſubordinat
Prelat, ſuch as be all Archbiſhops &amp; Biſhops (who
are as equally ſubject to the Canons, as the pooreſt Prieſt)
have not proceeded according to the lawes of holy Church,
the Conſtitutions of the See Apoſtolick, the Decrees of generall
Councels, the ſacred Canons received, &amp; of force in all
Tribunals, but that ſuch Iudges, whether Archbiſhops or Biſhops
have gone aſtray, contrary to the rules preſcribed by
the above-mentioned Legiſlatours, all which are their ſuperiours
in juriſdiction, &amp; as farre above them in power &amp; authority,
as the common people are inferiour unto their immediat

Prelats &amp; Paſtours. It is plaine, that in ſuch caſe neither
Prieſt nor People, is bound either in law or conſcience
to obey any ſuch Archbiſhop, or Biſhop, or their ſentence,
not grounded &amp; founded on that law, according to which
they preciſely were bound to judge. For ſaith B. Aug. Ser. 6.
de Verbis Domini. Ʋbi duo ſuperiores mandant oppoſita, Inferiori
non eſt obediendum; where two Superiours command oppoſite
things, the Inferiour is not to be obeyed. And S. Gregory
Pope: Imperiali conſtitutione ſancitum eſt, ut ea quae contra
l
                        •
                     ges fiunt, non ſolùm inutilia, ſed etiam pro inſectis habenda
ſi
                        •
                     t: It is enacted by Imperiall conſtitution, that the things
which are done againſt law, are not only unprofitable, but to
be eſteemed as not done at all. Gregor. in Regeſto, lib. 7. Epiſt.
7. and inſerted in the Canon, 25. q. 2. Imperiali.
               
               How idlely then, or rather ignorantly, or rather maliciouſly
doe our Friars teach the people, &amp; that as confidently,
as if it were a point of their Catechiſme, that none may examine
the doctrine of the Archbiſhop, or his ſentences, as if
he were a god, who neither could erre in judgment, or ſin in
will, when as the law ſaith plainly, Non debet is poenam ſuſtinere
canonicam, in cujus damnatione non est prolata ſententia canonica,
11. q. 3. He ought not to ſuffer a canonicall puniſhment,
in whoſe condemnation a canonicall ſentence is not
pronounced: plainly thereby ſuppoſing that the Prelat may
abuſe the Keyes, &amp; erre in his cenſures. And the gloſſe upon
the ſame cap. ſaith, Si ergo conſtet tibi, quod ſententia Iudicis
eſt iniqua, potes Iudicis violentis reſiſtere. If it appeareth unto
thee, that the ſentence of the Iudge be unjuſt, thou art not
bound to obey his violence. Which is alſo confirmed Extra
de Appellationibus cap. Significaverunt. And the Angelicall
Doctour S. Thomas, whoſe authority is ſuch, as it is confeſſed,
yea confirmed by the graveſt judgment in the Church of
God, that he never taught any error in Divinity, hath this
Concluſion, 2. 2. q. 104. art. 5. Subditi in ijs rantummodo ſuperioribus
ſuio obedire tenentur, in quibus ipſi ſuis ſuperioribus ſubijciuntur,
&amp; in quibus ipſi ſuperiores ſublimioris poteſtatis praecepto

non adverſantur: Inferiours in ſuch things alone are
bound to obey their Superiours, in which they are ſubject
unto their Superiors, &amp; wherein thoſe their Supe
                     •
                  iours go
not againſt the precept and commaund of a power higher
then is theirs. And in the corps of the aforeſaid Concluſion,
he 
                     •
                  luſtrateth the ſame doctrine out of S. Aug. ſer. 6. de verbis

                  , the
Generall, and God. Where neither the Captaine againſt the

                  t. Infinite are the
Authors both ancient &amp; moderne, which might in this caſe
be produced, if it were neceſſary. But how can it be neceſſary
ſo to doe, when Experience teacheth us, &amp; we ſee dayly
before our eyes in all Tribunals, as well Eccleſiaſt: call as Civill,
ſentences upon better conſideration, at the inſtance and
motions of the partyes &amp; their learned Councell ſomtimes
reexamined, ſomtimes reverſed, ſometimes appealed from to
higher Tribunals, and there corrected. For it fareth not in
Chriſtian Common-wealth, &amp; much leſſe in the Church of
God, which is ruled by juſt &amp; wholſome lawes, as it doth among
Turks &amp; Inſidels, barbarous &amp; brutiſh nations, where
there is no other law but the will, or rather the appetite of
the Commander. And I would aske our Friars, growne ſo
violent &amp; imperious, rather through their multitu

                  e then
their learning; To what end doth the law allow Appelles

                  entence of Inferiour Iudges, whether they be Eccleſiaſticall,
or Civill, unto the ſupreme, in caſe it were not
lawfull for the partyes ſentenced, to examine their ſentence
according unto the rules of law, whether being juſtly condemned,
they ſhould ſo reſt thēſelves contented; or finding
it otherwiſe to ſeek their remedy? I would alſo aske our
Friars, in caſe Iudges &amp; Magiſtrates could not erre, to what
end Almighty God ſo often, &amp; ſo ſeriouſly ſhould exhort all
Iudges, Magiſtrates, &amp; Rulers of the people, to the adminiſtration
of Iuſtice, &amp; not to look after rewards, but to tender

the caſe of the Widow, Stranger, &amp; Orphan, menacing
ſo many heavy threats &amp; curſes upon the heads of ſuch as
pervert Iudgment: Vae qui dicitis malum, bonum; ponentes teuebras
lucem, &amp; lucem tenebras: Vae qui juſtificatis impium pro
muneribus, &amp; juſtitiam juſti aufertis ab eo. Eſay 5. Woe be to
you who call evill, good; placing darknes light, and light
darknes. Woe be to you who juſtifie the wicked for rewards,
and rob the juſt man of his Iuſtice.
               I would alſo demaund of our Friars, To what purpoſe are
ſo many bookes of the Canon, Civill, Common, and Statute
Law written? wherefore ſo many Studies, and Colledges
of the lawes founded and erected, witneſſe Paris, Orleance,
Bo
                     •
                  ognia, Padua, Salamanca, and our Innes of Court of London,
and thorough all Chriſtian Common wealthes, but to
teach both Iudge, Advocate &amp; Client, rectum diſcernere iniquo,
to diſtinguiſh betwixt right and wrong: that Church
or Commonwealth ever beſt governed, where the feweſt
caſes are left unto the breſt of the Iudge, alwayes preferring
the ſilent before the ſpeaking law, as leſſe ſubject to errour
and corruption.
               Let then our Fryars ceaſe henceforward to teach that barbarous
doctrine ambulantem in tenebris: I ſay, that corner, or
rather taverne doctrine, which every Tradeſman, Kitchenmaide,
and three-footed old trot, have hourely in their
mouthes, rammed into their heads by their falſe teachers:
That the Biſhop is to be obeyed in right and wrong, &amp; that
no inferiour unto him may examine or call in queſtion his
Cenſures, Decrees, or Iudgments, but rather let them learne
that better leſſon of the Orator, Amor, &amp; odium, &amp; privatum
commodnm, ſapè faciunt judicem non cognoſcere verum, lib. 1.
Rhetoricorum. Affection, Hatred, and private commodity,
makes many times a Iudge not to know the truth. And who
knowes not, that in all ages, the world hath much halted on
that legge, I meane of Injuſtice. And ſome will unhappily
ſay: that this age wherein we live, is not much better then
her predeceſſours.
               
                  
Now my laſt Argument in this caſe ſhall be Ad hominem:
convincing my Adverſaries by their owne practiſe. As thus.
               If it be not lawfull for the Subject or Inferiour to queſtion
the ſentence of his Superiour: the Prieſt of the Biſhop. I
then demand: How came it to paſſe, that in England of late,
our Friars doe queſtion the commaund of the Biſhop of
Calcedon, that moſt reverend, pious, &amp; learned Prelat, who
was placed over the Engliſh Cleargy by the See Apoſtolicke?
Where
                     •
                  ore did the Monkes, as alſo the Ignatian Friars
or Ieſuites, write diverſe bookes and treatiſes againſt
him, which bookes we have ſeene and read; ſurely theſe
Monkes were none of the Lord of Calcedon his Superiours
at all.
               Againe, What is the cauſe, why that libelling Friar of S.
Francis Order, (cloaking his infamous writings under the
name of Edmundus Vrſulanus, in his booke called, Examen
Iuridicum Cenſurae Pariſienſis,) is ſo bold not onely to call
in queſtion, but abſolutely to condemne the Excommunication
of the moſt Illuſtrious Archbiſhop of Paris, publiſhed
againſt ſuch as ſhall defend &amp; maintaine the Eleven Propoſitions,
commonly called the Iriſh Propoſitions; Vrſul
                        ••
                     us
himſelfe being but a ſeditious Friar, and I trow none of the
Archbiſhops Iudge or Superiour at all.
               And to come neerer home: How came it to paſſe? That in
Droghedah ſome ten yeares agoe, certaine of the Ieſuites
being excommunicated, &amp; that by name by Iames Plonket,
then Conſervator Iuris for the Franciſcans: And certaine of
the Franciſcans on the other ſide, excommunicated by an other
Indge, at the procurement of the Ieſuites; neither one
or other yeelded obedience to the aforeſaid Excommunications,
but both ſtood ſtiffely in defence of their owne opinions,
exclayming againſt, and condemning each other in
publicke Sermons, to the great ſcandall &amp; diſaedification of
all good Catholiques: And yet neither was the Franciſcan,
or Ignatian Friars Superiours unto thoſe Prelats, who for
their ſakes fulminated thoſe Cenſures.
               
                  
And laſtly to come home, &amp; unto our owne doores: What
ſay you gentle Friars unto this late example, &amp; now in the
mouth of every one, as well Proteſtant, as Catholicke, I ſay,
of our Archbiſhop of Dublin, Thomas Flemming, aliàs Barnwell,
Friar of the Order of S. Francis, who ſtands at this day
excommunicated, yea Excommunicatus nominatim, &amp; denunciatus,
Excommunicated by name, &amp; denounced; &amp; the ſame
by a Papall Excommunication, legally, &amp; for moſt juſt cauſes
publiſhed againſt him; &amp; he not able to give any reaſon either
of the Iujuſtice or Invalidity thereof, remaines obſtinately
diſobediant, unto the See Apoſtolicke, to the great
ſcandall &amp; diſaedification of all Catholickes, not onely of
this Dioceſſe, &amp; Kingdome, but thorough the whole Chriſtian
World. So as he who moſt injuſtly, &amp; contrary to all
courſe of law cenſured others, himſelfe is faſt bound in the
tyes of an excommunication, &amp; that from the See of Rome:
So as it may truely be ſaid of him: Incidit in lequeum quem
fecit, &amp; ſuper caput ipſius deſcendet iniquitas ejus. He is falne
into the Pit which he digged for others, and upon his head
ſh. Il his iniquity deſcend. Pſal. 7.
               To conclude then this point, and ſummarily to lay together
what hath more largely beene diſcourſed. I ſay forſomuch
as the Archbiſhop our Ordinary hath not troden in
the ſteps of the ancient Fathers, not obſerved ſuch Rules as
the ſacred Canons, Councells and Decrees of the ancient
have preſcribed to him, and all other Iudges as their lawfull
Superiours, as in all other their Court proceedings; ſo in awarding
their ſente
                     •
                  ces &amp; cenſures, but that the ſaid Lord
Archb. in the caſe of the aforenamed Prieſts, moſt illegally,
exorbitantly &amp; a
                     •
                  omolouſly, hath proceeded by publiſhing
his ſentence in the firſt place, which ought to be in the laſt,
having omitted not onely ſolemnia juris, but eſſentialia juris,
not onely the ſolmnities of the law, but even the very life,
p
                     ••
                  hand eſſence thereof: As firſt a lawfull citation or calling
unto their an
                     •
                  wer, the examination and probation of cauſe
againſt them: neither hath, as the law requireth, mentioned

in his ſentence the particular cauſe of the peoples Excommunication
in hearing the Maſſes of theſe two R. Prieſts,
but onely (as hath beene ſaid) in univerſali, in generall, &amp; in
the aire, to wit, diſobedience not individuated; they therefore
except againſt his proceedings as moſt illegall, &amp; corrupt:
&amp; confidently avouch, that the aforeſaid cenſure of Excommunication
is nulla, irrita, &amp; invalida; voyde, invalid, &amp;
of no force, &amp; ſo to be held &amp; eſteemed of all. And ſuch Regulars,
whether they be Monkes, or Mendicants, which (like
unto Ephrain againſt Manaſſes, &amp; Manaſſes againſt Ephraim,
but both againſt Iudah) doc labour to extinguiſh the Cleargy,
&amp; to draw unto themſelves as well the dependance and
countenance of the people, as their purſes; &amp; to that end do
teach the Laity, that they ought to make great ſcruple of
the aforeſaid Excommunication. They are falſe teachers, &amp;
of the number of them, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh unto
Ti
                        •
                     us. 1. qui univerſas domos ſubvertunt, docentes quae non oportet,
turpis lucri gratiâ; who ſubvert whole houſes, teaching
ſuch things as they ought not, for filthy lucres ſake. For the
Citizens can well witneſſe with us, that they run from
houſe to houſe, moſt ſeditiouſly incenſing, and ſetting the
people againſt us, not regarding juſtice, or injuſtice, but what
may beſt ſerve for the erecting of their ſo long deſired a
Monarchy. And with ſuch diligence doe theſe apply their
buſineſſe in this matter of the ceuſure, abuſing the ignorance
&amp; credulity of the Laity, as if they cannot draw the good
man of the houſe unto their ſtraine, then they betake themſelves
unto the good-wife, from her unto the children, Apprentiſes
and ſervants, not ceaſing till they have put the
whole family into a combuſtion &amp; broyles one with another.
While we in the meane time with patience have endured
all the wrongs &amp; injuries of theſe their ſeducements:
yea till with their importunity, and many a falſe corner lye,
they have made us as odious unto the people, as any male factours.
For what cannot ſuch a multitude perſwade? Kinſmen
to theſe, goſſips to thoſe, matching theſe couples, bringing

cuſtome to that ſhop, giving here the Scapulare, there
the cord, aſcribing ſuch vertue &amp; protection unto them, as
holy Church never taught, nay attributing ſuch grace &amp; merit
unto one Saturſdayes Faſt, after they heare &amp; take notice
of the death of a certaine Spaniſh Nun, called Luiſſa, as more
can not be aſcribed unto the Paſſion of our Saviour Chriſt;
well worthy to be ſwayled with faggots in the Inquiſition,
for ſuch pernicious doctrine. But of this point, if God ſpare
me life, theſe ſeducers ſhall heare more from me ere long.
            
            
               CAP. IIII.
               A third Argument againſt the Excommunication.
               
                  NOW then having anſwered unto ſuch poore
ſhifts &amp; ſilly excuſes as the Cordiliers, &amp; the reſt
of the Friars make for the Ordinary. I will proceed
to a third Argument or Reaſon, diſabling
the aforeſaid cenſure of Excommunication: as thus.
               Such a fault as could not have beene forbidden unto the
Prieſts, as principalls under paine of Excommunication,
much leſſe could have bin inhibited the people, as acceſſary
and participating with them in the ſame fault, under paine
of Excommunication. But
               Diſobedience could not have beene forbidden the Prieſts
themſelves under paine of Excommunication.
               
                  Ergo, neither unto the people.
               The Major of this Syllogiſme, is that rule of the law, Regula
42. Acceſſorium ſequitur nat
                        •
                     ram principalis; The Acceſſory
followes the nature of the principall. To make it familiar
by an example, of which every one may be capable. If an
Vſ
                     •
                  rer be not puniſhable by the law, neither then the Broaker,
or the Clarke that drawes the Bonds of the uſurarious
contract or bargaine.
               As for the Minor, That Diſobedience it ſelfe could not
have beene forbidden the Prieſts under any cenſure, is manifeſt

by this. Firſt (as hath bin often ſaid,) That Diſobedience
is a generall vice, ſpreading it ſelf into many branches,
as a river dividing his ſtreames into many brookes, And ſecondly,
for that Diſobedience may fall upon a matter ſo
light and triviall, as will not beare the burden of ſo great a
cenſure. For let me aske our Scotiſts, Whether the Archbiſhop
can inhibit &amp; forbid the Inhabitants of his Dioceſſe,
under paine of Excommunication, never to commit any ſin.
The thing is ſo manifeſt, that he can not, as till it be affirmed
that he may. It will ſpare any further diſcourſe about it. It
remaineth then, that forſomuch as the people could not be
excommunicated for the Prieſts diſobedience, it muſt neceſſarily
follow, That the Excommunication falls upon them
only for being preſent at their Maſſes: which how well it
ſorts with my Lord Archb. profeſſion to inflict, I leave to
conſideration.
            
            
               CAP. V.
               A fourth Argument againſt the Excommunication.
               
                  MY fourth reaſon manifeſting not only the Injuſtice,
but the Nullity &amp; Invalidity of the aforeſaid
Excommunication awarded againſt the
Laytie, in the caſe of hearing thoſe two R. Prieſts
their Maſſes, ſhall be this, which for brevities ſake, I will
conclude in this Syllogiſme.
               An Excommunication inflicted for a vertuous act, containes
an intollerable errour, &amp; ſo by the ſecond principle is
moſt injuſt and invalid.
               But to be preſent at the adminiſtration of Sacraments by
Prieſts, who are free of all canonicall cenſures, is a vertuous
action.
               Therefore an Excommunication fulminated againſt ſuch
as be preſent thereat, is not onely voyde of force, but alſo
wicked.
               
                  
For declaration of the Minor, it is to be underſtood, That
ſo long as the Prieſts are uncenſured, they are ſuppoſed by
the Church as men allowed, to whom all may have acceſſe
in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments. For when the
Church holdes it not ſafe for the people to communicate
with their Prieſts, or Paſtours, whether Biſhops, or Curates,
or any other who have lawfull ordination, &amp; juriſdiction, It
beginnes (as is moſt reaſonable) firſt with the head, to cure
the maladyes &amp; diſeaſes thereof, with the medicinable balſamon
of the Cenſures. (For the Cenſures of holy Church
ought to be medicinable, &amp; not vindicative, uſed for neceſſity,
&amp; ſerviceable to true Piety, &amp; not to ſiniſter ends. 2. q. 1,
multi. 34. q. 3.) So as if the Paſtor or Prieſt be not ſuſpended,
be not excommunicated, be not interdicted, nor the
ſame publiſhed unto the people, together with the particular
cauſe of ſuch cenſure, in the ſentence of the Prelat expreſſed,
&amp; mentioned. It is to be underſtood, that by the Church
he is tollerated, neither can the people be cenſured for participating
with him, either in divine, or civill actions. I ſay,
ſo long as himſelf is not cenſured: For to illuſtrate this by
a familiar example. Tell me, would it not be thought a ſtrange

that none ſhould frequent the ſhop, or buy &amp; ſell, with ſuch
a Merchant in the High-ſtreet, the ſaid Merchant neither puniſhed,
or puniſhable for any delict, or fault committed. I
now it would be ſo held. Now (gentle Reader) if

the Cenſure of the Archbiſhop, ſee down in the beginning
of this Treatiſe, you ſhall find no cenſure at all inflicted
upon the Prieſts, ſo as they (for any impediment unto the
contrary) may lawfully ſay Maſſe: And yet the people under
pain of Excommunication may not be preſent at the

This Logick I underſtand not, but I wot well what S. Gregory
hath in his 27. Hom. Ipſe ligandi atque folvendi poteſtate
ſe privat qui hanc pro ſuis voluntatibus, &amp; non pro ſubditorum
juribus exercet. He deprives himſelfe of the power of binding
and looſing, who exerciſeth the ſame at his owne

pleaſure, and not according unto the Lawes of the ſubject.

                  ift and laſt reaſon proving the Nullity &amp;
Invalidity of the aforeſaid Cenſure, (which
alſo may be gathered out of what hath beene
before noted in the precedent Chapters) is
this:
               That none can be puniſhed with the ſpirituall ſword of
Excommunication for the ſin of another, not partaking in
the ſame ſin himſelf. And although this be manifeſt by the
light of reaſon, as alſo by faith; yet I will not ſpare to adde
the conſent of Writers the reunto, as alſo of the Canon. So

                      in Sexto. And it hath the conſent of all Doctors, wherfore
in this caſe I will ſay unto my Prelat, as David ſaid unto
Almighty God, in the temporall puniſhment of his ſubjects
by peſtilence. 2. Reg. 24. Iſti qui oves ſunt quid fecerunt?
Theſe ſheep what have they done? Let thy hand (I pray
thee) be turned againſt my ſelfe, &amp;c. If the Prieſts have offended,
let them in the name of God be puniſhed, but what
hath the innocent people committed, that they ſhould be
cenſured, either for the Prieſts true, or ſuppoſed offences.
Sure if that great Doctour of the Church S. Gregory may be
judge, his ſentence will be for the people againſt our Prelat.
For theſe are his words: Non debet is poenam ſuſtinere canonicam,
in cujus damnationem non eſt canonica prolam ſententia, II
q. 3. That party ought not to ſuffer a canonicall puniſhment,
in whoſe condemnation no canonicall ſentence hath beene
pronounced.
               And thus (good Reader) having (I doubt not) convinced

thy conſcience of the Nullity &amp; impiety of this Cenſure, I
will proceed (Godwilling) one ſtep forward. And as hitherto
I have proved, that no obedience is due thereunto:
ſo I will undertake (by Gods aſſiſtance) to ſhew, and upon
good grounds, that in all conſcience it ought to be diſobeyed:
And that whoſoever yeeldeth obedience unto the ſame
(if he be not excuſed by invincible ignorance) doth not only
ſin mortally, but alſo continues in ſin, ſo long as in obedience
thereunto, he refuſeth to heare the Maſſes of the aforeſaid
Prieſts.
            
            
               CAP. VII.
               Wherein it is proved, That none in Conſcience may obey
the aforeſaid Excommunication.
               
                  THus then I argue; Defamation or the taking
away of a mans good name, is a mortall ſin.
So S. Thomas 2. 2. q, 73. 1. &amp; all Divines. Yea
&amp; ſo much is that defamation or detraction
greater, &amp; more grievous, by how much
it is more materiall, &amp; the partyres againſt
whom more honorable. And it is to be underſtood, That defamation
or detraction is not only verball, but alſo mentall
and reall, that is, not only in word, but in thought alſo, and in
fact. And becauſe every thing is made more familiar by examples;
I put the caſe, that my ſelf, as alſo the whole neighbourhood,
hath underſtood of ſome ſcandalous ſinne of one
of our old friends and familiar acquaintance, whom wee
held, albeit a poore, yet an honeſt, &amp; a very pious man, wherupon
we with-draw our good opinions from him, our
wonted converſation, our familiarity, and ſuch benefites as
from time to time we were wonted to beſtow upon him,
and ſtill would have continued, if we had not heard ſuch evils
of him: well, it appeares unto us not long after, that
the party was wronged, and free from all ſuch vice &amp; wickedneſſe,

as he was charged withall, and ſo as in conſcience
we are aſſured of his innocencie; yet notwithſtanding
we beare ourſelves towards him, as formerly we did, when
we believed thoſe evils of him, to his great diſcomfort, to
his diſcountenance in the world, and in fyne to his great
ſhame, &amp; infamy: I ſay in this caſe we all ſinne mortally, and
the blacke ſinne of Detraction, if not in thought, and in
word, yet (which is as bad as the reſt) really &amp; indeed. So I
ſay, theſe two R. Prieſts, ſo often mentioned, were charged
by their Ordinary with diſobedience, with continuall inſolency,
&amp;c. All this is manifeſted to be a malicious ſlander,
notwithſtanding are the people forbidden to be preſent at
their Maſſes, &amp; the ſame under paine of Excommunication.
One Fryar ſayes, the Cenſure ought to be obeyed: Another
ſayes at leaſt, it is the ſafeſt way. I ſay, they both erre, &amp; lead
into errour. For the ſafeſt way is, not to defame my brother,
or to obſcure his good name, nor yet to joyne and concurre
with ſuch as do detract &amp; with-draw from his juſt honour,
and that eſpecially in perſons of ſo eminent a ranke in the
Church, as are anointed Prieſts, by which meanes their miniſtery
is leſſe reſpected, and themſelves diſinabled to walke
in that vocation to which they are called.
               And firſt the Biſhop who gave ſo impious a ſentence, &amp;
next the Friar, who gadding from houſe to houſe, ſeekes to
perſwade the ſame, are guilty of moſt horride ſin, and as the
Apoſtle calls it, blaſphemy. And as well the one as the other
obliged to ſatiſfaction unto the Innocent ſo wronged, as alſo
unto the Church of God. In the meane time let both
Prieſt &amp; people comfort themſelves in that ſweet bleſſing,
pronounced by the month of our Saviour, Mat. 5. Beati eſt is
cùm maledixerint vobis, &amp;c. Bleſſed are you when men ſhall
revile you, &amp; ſhall perſecute you, &amp; ſhall ſpeake all evill of
you lying for my ſake: Be glad &amp; rejoyce, for great is your
reward in heaven, for ſo did they perſecute the Prophets
who were before you. And forſomuch as it is the counſell
of our ſweet Saviour, to love our enemyes, to doe good to

them that hate us, &amp; to pray for them that perſecute us. It
wilbe a worke of mercy, &amp; not (I truſt) miſbecomming me,
to give a parcell of good counſell &amp; advice unto my Prelat;
&amp; if with the Prophet Nathan, by ſetting his fault before
his face, I convert him into a penitent David, he to the ſpirituall
comfort of his ſoule, ſhall be reclaymed, and I to my
great conſolation, reape the fruit of my labours.
               O then, ſay I, if the Archbiſhop of Dublin, would but conſider
with himſelfe, &amp; ſet before his eyes, the practiſe of the
ancient Prelats of Gods Church, with what leaden paſes
they deſcended unto cenſures, never making uſe thereof, but
in remedileſſe occaſions, where no admonition, no exhortation,
no patience, no longanimity would prevayle. As if
they had ſaid with the Poët.

                  Cut off that part, which may infect the reſt.
               
               All courſes are firſt to be taken with the myſt icallmembers
of Chriſts body, with the children of the Church. But
that part (I confeſſe) which admits no cure, muſt be ſeparated
from his fellowes. The ancient Biſhops did never fulminate
their cenſures for triviall and light occaſions, and
much leſſe for cauſes not manifeſt, and well proved.

               Alas then, ſhall we thinke that this glorious St, ſometime
Biſhop of Hippo in Affrick, S. Auguſtin, brought with him
his cenſures &amp; his ſentences in his pocket, as Th
                        •
                     . Flemming,
aliàs Barnwell, Archbiſhop of Dublin uſeth &amp; then to ſend
for a Prieſt againſt whom he deſireth to have a cauſe. And
when he findes his opportunity, drawes out his ſentence of
ſuſpenſion from his pocket, as he did againſt that R. Prieſt,
Fa. Patricke Cahil, ſuſpending him from all prieſtly function,
&amp; the ſame ſo cauſeleſly &amp; ſo inconſequently, as he offered
at the ſame time, to give him under his hand, a teſtimony
of his learning and good life, yea and hath often, and to diverſe
averred that he was both an honeſt and a learned man,
which many of the. Inhabitants of this Citty, and Dioceſſe,
can, and doe witneſſe.
               Neither doe I thinke S. Ambr
                        •
                     ſe Archbiſhop of Millan,
came ever provided with his pocket cenſures of ſuſpenſion,
as our Archbiſhop of Dublin, Tho. Flemming, aliàs Barnwell
did, when ſending for Doctor, Peter Cadell, as to entreate
with him, (as he pretended) upon ſome occaſion of buſineſſe,
when he ſaw his time, puld out of his breeches a written
ſentence of a ſuſpenſion, reading the ſame againſt him.

A man of whom malice it ſelfe cannot finde what to ſpeake
amiſſe. And for no other cauſe, but that he refuſed to bee
baniſhed out of his dioceſſe by him, whilſt the Archbiſhop
himſelfe confeſſed that he had no cauſe againſt him, but onely
that he had no uſe of him. And the good gentleman thinking
it moſt unreaſonable, &amp; inhumane, to be putfi
                     •
                  om his friends,
his ſmall meanes, and thoſe few Benefactors, which by his
honeſt endeavours he had acquired. As eſpecially making a
great ſcruple to obey ſuch a majeſticall &amp; more then Regall
Commandement of Exile, (deſiring as alwayes to be found
faithfull to God, ſo alſo a loyall ſubject unto his King) refuſed
to obey that Baniſhment.
               Neither yet (I trow) did ever S. Iohn Chryſoſtome, Archbiſhop
of Conſtantinople, menace the Cenſure of Suſpenſion
in ſuch a caſe, as Tho. Flemming aliàs Barnwell, L. Archb.
of Dublin did unto Fa. Luke Rochfort of bleſſed memory,
for not reſending a letter back again unto him. which formerly
he had ſent him, witneſſe Fa. Patrieke Brangan, and
William Browne Prieſts, &amp; at this day living in Dublin, who
were meſſengers both of the letter, and of the threatned ſuſpenſion.
               Neither yet I wot well, S. Baſill Biſhop of Ceſarea, whe
                     •
                  
a Prieſt came to complaine of any wrong done him, did ever
intreat him ſo irreligiouſly, as the aforeſaid L. Archb. of Dublin
did Paul Harris Prieſt, the 18. day of Iuly 1631. in Dublin.
(himſelfe may well remember the place) after he had
made ſuch a complaint unto him of his Friars, as he was unwilling
to heare: for redreſſe of whoſe wrongs, he only had
theſe words from his lippes: I will excommunicate you if
you come any more in my preſence. A very ſufficient cauſe
(no doubt) of Excommunication, to come into a Biſhops
preſence.
               But truely as in the world, a wiſe and a diſcreet man will
not upon every occaſion have his hand upon his dagger,
ready to lay about him, Much leſſe becomes it a Prelat of the
Church, for every triviall, &amp; much leſſe for only framed and

deviſed matters, to draw out the ſpirituall ſword of his cenſures,
but rather let them remember, that they are placed over
us, as S. Peter tells them, 1. Pet. 5. 3. Non ut dominantes in
Cleris, ſed ut forma facti gregis ex animo; Not as lording it, &amp;
domineering over the Clergy, but rather to be an example
of all good converſation unto their flock. To which purpoſe
S. Hierom in his Epiſtle ad Nepotianum. Epiſcopi ſacerdot et
ſciant ſe eſſe, non dominos, honorent clericos quafi clericos, ut ipſis
Epiſcopis à clericis quaſi Epiſcopis honor deferatur. Scitum eſt ill

                     d
Oratoris Domitij. Cur ergo inquit te habeam ut principem,
cùm tu me non habeas ut Senatorem? Let the Biſhops know
themſelves to be Prieſts, and no Lords; Let them honour
Clergy-men, as Clergy-men, that they againe may give honour
unto Biſhops as Biſhops. For elegant is that ſaying of
the Oratour Domitius; Wherefore ſhould I regard thee as a
Prince, when thou doſt not uſe me as a Senatour? Like unto
which is that of the Councell of Trent, Seſſ. 13. cap. 1. If then
our Peter hath drawne out his ſword raſhly, and without
cauſe: let Peter a Gods name put up his ſword againe, as our
Saviour adviſeth him, ſaying: Converte gladium tuum in vaginam,
Put up thy ſword into his ſcabberd: That it be not
ſaid by lawfull authority another day to ſuch as abuſe their
ſwords, as our Saviour ſaid unto Peter: Qui acceperit gladium,
gladio peribit: He that ſmiteth with the ſword, ſhall periſh
by the ſword. And ſo much of the Reaſons or Arguments,
by which is manifeſted the Injuſtice and Invalidity
of the Archbiſhop his Excommunication.
               Yet that no diligence or meanes might be neglected on
our parts, to reclay me (if it were poſſible) our Ordinary
from thoſe violent proceedings againſt the Inhabitants of
his Dioceſſe: Mr 
                  Dr Cadell in my abſence (thogh not without
my conſent) did draw this Petition following, which
was exhibited unto him in a meeting of Prieſts, by the hands
of that R. &amp; learned Clergy-man, Iames Talb

(good Reader) that all our Ordinaryes invectives, as all his
Friars detractions &amp; obmurmurations againſt us, are ever in

or anſwering them. Such was the Oration of Caeſar the Dictator

being at that time many leagues from Rome: And ſuch

Prieſt, and Dr of Divinity.

Excommunication lata ſententiae to be publiſhed againſt the
Inhabitants of this Dioceſſe of Dublin, prohibiting them to
heare, or to be preſent at the Maſſes of Paul Harris, &amp; of Dr
Peter Cadell Prieſts, without any crime or cauſe ever proved
againſt the afore-named Prieſts, to the great ſcandall of the
whole Kingdome, the diſaedification &amp; ruine of many ſoules,
&amp; to the utter diſgrace &amp; defamatiō of the aforeſaid Prieſts,
being of good eſteeme &amp; reputation in this city of Dublin.
                           Your Suppliant therefore conſidering the cenſure of Excommunication
to be the greateſt and ſevereſt puniſhment
with which the Church doth chaſtiſe delinquents, &amp; notorious
offenders, introduced &amp; appointed by the ſame Church
In medicinam, &amp; non in ruinam animarum; and that the deliaquents
ſhould rather be puniſhed, then the innocents. Your

Petitioner in all due and canonicall obedience ſubmitting
himſelfe unto your Hon: as his Paſtour, humbly deſireth that
your L. would be pleaſed to take the matter uuto your mature
conſideration, &amp; that you may be pleaſed by due courſe
of law to cite before you. Hon: the above-named Prieſts,
Paul Harris &amp; Peter Cadell, &amp; that they may be brought unto
their anſwer, (which hitherto they never have been) of
whatſoever crimes may be layde unto their charge; &amp; being
convicted &amp; found guilty, that they be puniſhed according
to the quality of their faults; &amp; in the mean time to releaſe
the innocent People from ſo heavy a puniſhment, undeſervedly
inflicted upon them, little knowing what it meaneth.
But if on the contrary, the aforeſaid Prieſts ſhallbe found to
be innocent &amp; guiltleſſe, that then your L. will be pleaſed to
reſtore them to their good name &amp; fame injuſtly taken frō
them, to their great hurt &amp; dammage. And your Suppliant
ſhall pray. Dated April 6. 1632.
                        
                     
                  
               
               Iudge (gentle Reader) whether this Petition had not bin
enough to have mollified the heart of a Pharaoh, to have
freed the children of Iſrael from the Aegyptian ſervitude, &amp;
permit them to paſſe over th
                     •
                   red ſea, into the land of Promiſe?
And might not the ſame have prevayled (think you)
with a loving, religious &amp; a carefull Paſtor, to have releaſed
his Subjects from the bonds &amp; captivity of ſo injuſt an Excommunication?
But what anſwer had we of this Petition?
truly an Anſwer anſwerleſſe; for to this day we never received
any.
               Well, for my part, I will not ſay of my Paſtour (for the reſpect
I owe him) as Moſes ſaid of Pharaoh, Induratum eſt cor
Pharaonis, Pharaoh his heart is hardned. But ſurely I will ſay,
Non vult dimittere populum ut ſacrificent in deſert
                        •
                     : He will
not let the people goe to ſacrifice in the wilderneſſe with
Moſes &amp; Aaron. Yet as I doubt not but our Ordinary did
foreſee what errours he was to commit even from the very
firſt entrance into this buſines, (though over-ruled partly

by his own paſſion, &amp; partly by the continuall ſollicitation
of his Friars) he gave way thereunto. So I doubt not alſo,
but by this time he hath a deſire (eſpecially ſince the ſucceſſe
was no better) by correcting of his miſtakes, to bring matters
into joynt againe. One great impediment I feare will be
in his way, which is the reſtitution of honor &amp; fame, which
I tell you is a block that lyes before many in the path that
leades unto ſalvation. For albeit (I confeſſe) it goes much againſt
the haire to make reſtitution in temporall goods, in
which a man hath damuified his neighbour; yet have we in
the Old Teſtament a Tobias chap, 2. who commaunded the
ſame to be done: &amp; in the New a Zacheus, Luke 19: who
performed it himſelfe, But in reſtitution of honour &amp; fame,
our proud corrupt natures have ſuch an averſion to humble
our ſelves unto our equalls, &amp; much more to our Inferiours:
I ſay in acknowledging a wrong &amp; an injury done by us, unto
them, &amp; above all when the ſame requires a publicity, according
to the circumſtances of place and perſons in &amp; before
whom the ſame was committed, as it requires more
then an Heroicall vertue, to overcome ſo great a difficultyt
&amp; I know not, whether in all the Scriptures we have an example
thereof, as we had of the former: only I may ſay with
S. Auguſtine, as well in the one caſe as in the other: Non di
                     
                        •
                     ittitur
peccatum, niſi reſtitnatur ablatum. The ſin is not remitted,
unleſſe what is wrongfully taken away be reſtored,
Aug. tom. 2. Epiſt. 54. And it is a Concluſion with S. Thom.
Reſtituere quod injuſtè 
                        •
                     blatum eſt, eſt de neceſſitate ſalutis: It is
of neceſſity unto ſalvation, to reſtore back what is injuſtly
taken away. 2. 2. q. 62. art, 2. In which place (moſt learnedly
as alwayes) he ſheweth how a mans honour, fame and good
name, may injuſtly be taken away two manner of wayes,
Firſt in accuſing our neighbour, or reporting of him a crime
which is falſe, &amp; then are we bound to reſtitution, acknowledging
our ſelves to have wronged him, in ſpeaking of him
what was untrue. Secondly, in manifeſting his ſecret &amp; unknowne
faults, not having reſpect unto the due courſe of

law &amp; juſtice. In which caſe alſo reſtitution is to be made,
(yet without a lye) as in confeſſing we have defamed Titius
injuſtly, or have wronged him in his good name &amp; reputation.
So S. Tho. &amp; in theſe doctrines all divines agree with
him.
               Onely good Reader, give me leave further to inlarge my
ſelfe, as touching the difficulty that all of us doe ordinarily
finde in this kinde of reſtitution, I meane of fame, more then
of any other. To which purpoſe I will relate unto you a
ſhort Hiſtory, &amp; I beleeve neither unprofitable, nor unpleaſant,
which I finde in an old booke, &amp; indeed ſo old, as it was
printed above one hundred &amp; fifty yeeres agoe. Albeit for
a writer to be of that antiquity, is nothing. And this my
booke ſo ancient as appeares by the date of the impreſſion,
as well alſo may witneſſe the old Character, &amp; the excellencie
of the Paper, is in a farre bigger volume, then ever I
yet beheld booke, &amp; it hath hitherto had ſo good a fate (of
which alſo I am right glad) that it hath eſcaped the Indian
leafe, the greateſt enemy that this day I know, to the leaves
of many a good booke, I ſay in this our reumatique &amp; ſpitting
age: for it neither wanteth the firſt nor the laſt pages,
or any elſe thorough the whole volume. The name of it is
Correctorium Vitiorum, but the Author it ſeemes, meant not
to favour us ſo much, as to give us his name, for in ſtead
thereof, he is onely yelepped. Fabri lignarij filius: The Sonne
of the Carpenter, belike his father was free of S. Ioſephs
trade, but to our Story.
               This Author writing upon that commandement which S.
Auguſtine accounts to be the 7. but S. Hierome the 6. Non
furtum facies. Thou ſhalt not ſteale. Tells us of a certaine
Prieſt, who had a penitent, &amp; this penitent he was an arrant
theefe, but not of money or goods, but of honour and fame,
among other of his ſinnes acknowledging at the feet of his
ghoſtly father, that he had wronged a noble Gentleman in
his name, &amp; in his reputation, &amp; that very grievouſly before
many witneſſes. The Prieſt his ghoſtly father tells him he is

damned. He anſwers that he is very ſorry, &amp; were it to doe
againe, he would not for the world commit the like fact.
His Confeſſour tells him, he is damned. O ſayth the penitent,
good father have compaſſion on me, you ſee my teares
&amp; my unfained ſorrow &amp; contrition of heart for my offence.
Goe thy wayes, ſaith the Prieſt, for thou art damned. O father
of my ſoule, ſaith the penitent, I come hither to ſeeke
comfort in the Sacrament, having beene alwayes taught never
to diſpayre of Gods mercy, for what ſin or offence ſoever:
And for my part, I am willing to accept of what penance
ſhall be enjoyned me, though it were to goe on pilgriinage
to Rome or Compoſtella. Well then ſaith his ghoſtly
father, my child, If thou wilt be ſaved, goe thy wayes neither
to Rome nor to Compoſtella, but unto the very ſame party
whom thou haſt ſo ſlandered, ſeeke out all thoſe perſons
who at that time were preſent, when thou didſt him that
ſhame &amp; affront, and there before them all upon thy knees
confeſſe thy fault, &amp; humbly aſke him forgiveneſſe, &amp; having
ſo done, returne hither to me againe, &amp; I will give thee abſolution.
And ſhall I, that am a Gentleman, a man of note, &amp;
a commander in my country, ſo abaſe, &amp; diſgrace my ſelfe, I
will firſt be damned. Why, ſayth the Prieſt, &amp; did not I tell
thee ſo much before, and yet I could not make thee to beleeve
me? So farre my old booke. And how farre this may
concerne my L. Archbiſhop, let him conſider of it, when he
reades this Chapter.
            
            
               CAP. VIII.
               How all our Archbiſhops endeavours, are, to ſuplant the Clergie,
and to plant the Fryars in their places.
               
                  NOw it is a matter worthy our pond
                     •
                  ration to
conſider upon what grounds the Archbiſhop
preſumes to doe all theſe things ſo lawleſly, and
yet with ſuch confidence, as if no impediment

could be given to theſe his proceedings. And this is a point
which breedes great admiration in many, not onely Catholickes,
but Proteſtants alſo; yea it ſeemes to be a myſtery, of
which no reaſon can be aſſigned. And ſo I confeſſe it is, yet
onely unto thoſe who looke upon our affayres as it were a
farre off, &amp; not at hand, paſſing by the way, &amp; not of ſet purpoſe,
as not deſirous to trouble themſelves with what doth
not ſo neerely concerne them. But we who are the Patients
of theſe his wrongs &amp; injuryes, are able both to ſatiſfie our
ſelves &amp; others in the premiſes: As having not onely obſerved
the ends he aymes at, but the meanes alſo which hee uſeth
in the proſecution, &amp; the compaſſing of his ends, which
for the ſatiſfaction of my Reader, I will ſet downe, and the
ſame in fewer words then a matter of ſo large extent can
well be handled.
               Firſt then it is to be obſerved, that our Anchbiſhop Tho.
Flemming, aliàs Barnwell, was not elected at all out of the body
of the Cleargy; but frō among the Regulars: (By Regulars
I underſtand Monks &amp; Fryars) having been for many yeares
(as he alſo is at this day) a Fryar of the Order of S. Francis.
And a
                     •
                   commonly thoſe Prelates who are choſen from among
the Fryars, doe not ſo much conſider &amp; looke before
them to what ſtate and place they are called, namely to be
heads of the Clergy, as what by long cuſtome &amp; education,
they have beene, ſtill looking backe unto their Order, their
fellow Fryars; whoſe glory to advance, they hold it no ſmall
glory unto themſelves. So then our Archbiſhop Th
                        •
                     , Flemming,
aliàs Barnwell, Fryar of the Order of S. Franch, having
by the Mediation of his great friends beyond the
ſeas: (himſelfe being alſo of an honourable Family,) obtained
of his Holineſſe to bee called unto the dignitie of the
Archbiſhop of Dublin, that ſuit being ſtrongly ſeconded by
the potency and ſedulity of the Fryars of his owne Order,
who by all meanes ſeeke to effect, (as they have often done)
to have Biſhops made out of their Convents, accounting
themſelves as good as Lords of that Dioceſſe, whoſe Biſhop

is a Fryar: neither is this proper onely to the Cordiliers,
but to all other Orders of Regulars: Onely the Ignatians, I
confeſſe, are not ſo bent to ſeeke for theſe dignityes, at leaſt
in Europe, though we heare that in the Indyes they ſhoot
alſo at that marke.
               Yet this Epiſcopation of Fryars, eſpecially in the See Apoſtolicke,
is not held ſo convenient, and therefore by the
wiſedome of the Cardinals is either wholly taken away, or
at leaſt much diſcontinued. Forſomuch as now for theſe 60.
yeares paſt, we have not had any Monke or Fryar advanced
unto that ſeat; I ſay, ſince the dayes of Sixtus quintus, who
was a conventuall Fryar of the Order of S. Francis. And the
ſaid government might very well be obſerved (as the beſt)
thorough the whole Church, &amp; would alſo, no doubt, if it
were not for the Importunity of them, who finde that the
eaſieſt way to climbe unto that greatneſſe which they ſo
much affect. And to this purpoſe you may call to minde the
parable of him who went at midnight to his neighbours
houſe to borrow 3. loaves, Luke 11. But upon what neceſſity?
Forſooth becauſe, ſaith he: Amicus meus venit de via ad
me, &amp; non habeo quod ponam ante illum: A friend of mine is
come out of his way, &amp; I have not what to ſet before him.
But who is this friend who is come out his way, &amp; wants
his ſupper? Mary a Friar, who hungreth after a Biſhopricke.
For ſurely ſo often as a Friar, who hath by vow renounced
all dignities, &amp; advancements, as well ſpirituall, as temporall,
hungers after a Myter, &amp; ſends his friend to Rome to negotiate
for him, he is, (no doubt,) out of his right way; for it
is not unknowne what path the Friar ought to keepe. The
path of a more then an ordinary humility, the path of auſterity
&amp; mortification, the path of continuall prayer &amp; recollection.
The path of abjection &amp; denyall, not onely of preferments
&amp; dignities, and whatſoever may be pleaſing unto
his ſenſes, but even of his owne ſelfe, his will, his appetites,
&amp; deſires, naked and without all intereſt and propriety of
things in the world

                   follow our Saviour naked upon: the

croſſe. So farre from begging of Biſhoprickes at the Popes
gate, as he by his rule &amp; holy inſtitution ought to begge a
morſell of bread, &amp; a meſſe of pottage at the Chriſtian mans
doore, for his preſent &amp; dayly reliefe. And no doubt alſo, but
the goodman of the houſe, and the head of the family would
willingly be excuſed of his importunity, &amp; rid of his ambitious
demands, were it not propter improbitatem amici, by
reaſon of the extreame importunity of his friend, this
Prince, that Nobleman, this Guardian, that Provinciall, theſe
letters, thoſe Embaſſadours, &amp; what not? yea &amp; with great
reaſon, &amp; good manners alſo, might theſe unſeaſonable ſuiters

                     •
                  e rejected, &amp; ſent home empty handed. For the goodman
who hath the loaves might ſay, Noli mihi moleſtus eſſe,
jam oſtium elauſum eſt: Be not troubleſome unto me, for now
the doore is ſhut. The lawes &amp; canons of holy Church: The
rules of your particular inſtitute &amp; orders; Your own free
choiſe &amp; election. Your vowes of poverty and obedience
in your profeſſion, hath ſhut the doore upon all theſe your
ambitious pretentions. Noli mihi moleſtus eſſe, Good Friar be
contented, &amp; get thee home unto thy Cell: Take thy Beads,
&amp; thy diſcipline into thy hands, &amp; fetch out this temptation
of a Biſhoprick, that is upon thee, and leave hereafter to
trouble me, thou ſeeſt the doore is ſhut. Et pueri mei mecum
ſunt in cubili: &amp; my children they are with me in the
bed-chamber. The Clergy my moſt lawfull &amp; legitimat children,
to whom theſe dignities of right appertaine, &amp; do belong,
mecum ſunt in cubili, are with me in the chamber, of the
ſame Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchy, as the moſt principall members
thereof, the loaves are therfore theirs, &amp; I may not take
the childrens bread &amp; give it unto ſtrangers. But what will
you have of it? the Friar is conſtant in knocking, &amp; wil have
no deniall. So as at length the good old man overcome and
wearyed out with an obſtinate &amp; a never ending ſolicitation,
he gra
                     •
                  ts him his requeſt: And the Friar comes home
with a Miter, but not alwayes of beſt ability to undergo that
charge, or to manage that place. For as Ariſtotle diſputes it

in his Politiques: Quòd 
                        〈◊〉
                      vir

                      civis: A
good man, is not alwayes a good Common-wealths man: So
hath it bin obſerved, not only in other Countreyes, but even
in this Kingdome, that ſuch Biſhops as were made out of
Monkes &amp; Friars, commonly proved not the fitteſt for the
paſtorall charge. So as many times in 
                     〈◊〉
                   a Friar into a
Biſhop, you marre a good Friar, &amp; yet make up no good Biſhop.
For that of Ariſtotle is alſo true, Magiſtrat as indicat
virum: The ſufficiency of a man is not ſo well knowne, as
when he commeth to government. And this that great obſerver

               Yet let no man ſo farre miſtake me, as to imagin that I intend
in this diſcourſe, to diſparage the office, or diminiſh
the dignity of ſuch Biſhops, as are aſſumed from among the
Friars. Far be from me any ſuch thought, for we thankfully
acknowledge ſome of them, even in this Kingdome, to be
very good heads of the Clergy, &amp; zealous of their honour;
neither yet to infirnate, that for any perſonall defect, either
of Iudgment, learning, or diſcretion, their ſacred office and
Miniſtery is leſſe to be eſteemed. Forſomuch as S. Ambroſe
tells me in his Paſtorali, Nihil in hoc ſaeculo excellentius ſacerdotibus:
Nihil ſublimim Epiſcopis reperiri poteſt: Nothing in
this world is more excellent then the Prieſts: Nothing more
ſublime then the Biſhops. Yea, give me leave to illuſtrate
this diſtinction of perſonal infirmities, &amp; Epiſcopall dignities,
by a ſpeech proceeding from a certaine Noble-man in
England, in the time of King Richard the 3. for me thinkes it
reſeuteth a very ſound judgment. This Nobleman being ſollicited
by others of his quality, to joyne with them in depoſing
that King, who was held both for a Tyrant, &amp; an Vſurper,
made anſwer, That he in no ſort would concurre in any
ſuch action with them. For (ſaith he) let him be what he
will, he hath now the Crowne upon his head, and if you ſet

the Crowne upon a ſtake or a poſt, I for my part will follow
it. What that Nobleman ſaid of the Crowne, the ſame ſay I
of the Miter, let it be placed either on the head of a deſerving
or an or an undeſerving man, I for my part will honour and
obey the ſame, as hitherto I have everdone. Now, what obedience
is due unto the Miter, I happily ſhall have occaſion
to ſpeake hereafter. In the meane time after ſo long a digreſſion,
let us returne to what in the beginning of this Chapter
I propoſed, &amp; the Reader may help himſelf by looking
back a page or two.
               So it happened, as our preſent Archbiſhop (his Predeceſſour
being deceaſed at Rome) landed in Ireland about the
yeare 1623. And ſcarce had he twi
                     •
                  t looked about him, but
what before his arrivall was plotted twixt him &amp; his Fryars
beyond, he here beginne
                     •
                   to put in execution. But what
ſay you is that? Mary a Plantation upon the Clergy, and in
their places to bring in the Monks &amp; the Friars, which about
thoſe times, as alſo before in great numbers, &amp; of all Orders
hither ro
                     •
                  ayoed &amp; are now growne into ſuch a head (mainly
ſtrengthened by the Er
                     ••
                  ciſcan Archbiſhop) as by the
weake &amp; well neere minated Clergy, they are unreſiſtable.
Neither (when I ſpeak of Monks and Friars) thinke that I
forget the Ieſuites, for them I range under t
                     •
                  e ſtandard and
colours of the Friars. Now the meanes to effect this Plantation
wars, to make themſelves ſtrong, &amp; the Clergy weake. To
make themſelves ſtrong, was to take into their Orders by
all manner of allurements and perſwaſions, ſuch as may bee
thought any wayes fit for their purpoſe: &amp; to this end they
induce Gentlemens ſecond ſonnes, as alſo Farmers ſonnes, &amp;
Merchants Apprentices, among which they found (and ſtill
doe) a plentifull harveſt. For I have heard Merchants of Dublin
complayning, that ſcarce could they have an Apprentice
to ſerve out the halfe of his yeares, before he had a vocation
to be a Fryar. And among thoſe they refuſed not alſo to ad
                  
                     •
                  it.
Serving-men, Soldiers, Taylours, &amp; Horſe-boyes, who
are now become R. Fathers, though neither learned, nor civill

men. And indeed by taking in ſuch a multitude of rude,
&amp; licentious youthes, of all ſorts and conditions, many ſcandalls
have happened among them theſe yeares paſt. And no
marvaile, for when ſuch a company of unbridled colts break
looſe from obedience of Parents &amp; Maſters, by whom they
were formerly curbed &amp; kept in awe, and begin to taſte that
pleaſant liquor of liberty, which under the Fryars they ſuddenly
injoyed, they grew very inſolent &amp; terrible, yea and
many times inſupportable. For their new Superiours, not
willing to diſtaſte their novices (who many times in regard
of the portions &amp; meanes they brought with them, were indeed
their Maſters.) And partly for feare of looſing them, of
whom for a long time they could not be well aſſured, as alſo
leſt by offending and diſcontenting of them, they ſhould not
ſo eaſily draw in others. And laſtly, for that in truth ſuch Monaſticall
diſcipline (as is requiſit &amp; commanded by the rule)
could not conveniently be obſerved in this Countrey, ſo
many abuſes on a ſudden did ruſh
                     •
                   in among them, as it moved
ſome zealous of the common good, (true lovers of piety,
&amp; vertue; &amp; not only of the ſpecious names &amp; glorious
titles therof) to move his Holines for a Reformation, which
accordingly was effected, &amp; a direction came downe; That
no Novices ſhould be received into any Order of Religion
in theſe parts, where Regular diſcipline could not be obſerved.
But this Inhibition took as much effect with our Friars,
as if it had come from me. For the manner of our Regulars
in theſe parts is: That if any thing from the Citty be obtayned
in their behalfe; for example, any new priviledge, or
augmentation of authority, Exemption, Faculty, Indult,
Grant, Diſpenſation, Immunity, which fals out to their content,
and of which themſelves by long fuit have beene the
procurers; O
                     •
                   it is received as an Oracle, it is publiſhed,
it is proclaymed, it is urged, it is inſiſted upon. And
what but the authority of the See Apoſtolicke, Obedience,
Obedience. But if on the contrary, by reaſon of my
juſt complaint made againſt them by the Biſhops &amp; Preats

of the Clergy, any reſtraint or limitation of their power be
made, or diminutiō of their greatnes, which may but eclipſe
the ſmalleſt glimpſe of their accuſtomed ſplendor, then ſhall
ſuch Apoſtolicall letters be viewed, &amp; reviewed, they ſhall
be ſearched, weighed, &amp; pondered, they ſhall be conſtrued,
gloſſed, &amp; interpreted, yea every point and iota ſhall be examined
&amp; pryed into; if happily by any meanes they may be
avoyded. But if no ſuch flaw can be found in them, then forſooth
they were obtayned by ſiniſter &amp; wrong information,
&amp; ſo ſubject unto obreption. or elſe their Generalls have
not ſignified them, &amp; ſo no reckoning to be made of them.
Example where of wee have lately ſeene in the Bull of the
Revocation of Facultyes: And now ſince that againe, in the
Inhibition, De non admittendis Novitijs in Hibernia, I ſay
then, ſince the time that our Fryars began to give their habit,
&amp; to take in Probationers in the Kingdome (which before
in much fewer numbers were bred for them beyond
ſeas) they are increaſed to ſuch a height, as they are become
not onely terrible unto the Biſhops &amp; Clergy, but whoſoever
ſhall oppoſe them ſhall find of what power they are of.
And this may well be underſtood if wee doe but obſerve
what Inwardneſſe, or rather I may call it, a kinde of Kinred
&amp; alliance they have contracted, not onely with the common
people, but with them alſo of beſt note and ranke, by
drawing unto them this ſonne, that Daughter, this brother,
that ſiſter, this uncle, that aunt, this Nephew, that Niece, this
Kinſman, that Apprentice: So as they are become farie more
deare &amp; neere unto the Inhabitants, then were ever in times
paſt, Foſters, or Goſſips: So as by their owne multitudes, &amp;
this intaylemente of their Devotoes, they are now able in
two houres to make the worthy eſt man either of our Clergy
or. Laity (within the Citty of Dublin, or where elſe they
reigne) as odious and hatefull unto the people, as any Malefactour
whatſoever.
               What ſhall I ſay of that hereditary diſeaſe of lying, which
raignes among our Mendicants, by which they compaſſe

their ends, &amp; prevayle marveilouſly in their deſignments,
yea &amp; beyond all expectation. I call lying an hereditary diſeaſe
among Fryars: For that Thomas Walſingham, ſometimes
a Ciſtertian Monke of S. Albons, a moſt pious, and a learned
man. &amp; among other writers moſt renowned in the Chronicle
of ſuch Engliſh Kings whoſe lives he writ, obſerved
&amp; committed the ſame to poſterity: That it was a good argument

therefore hath a colour. This teſtimony of Walfinghams ſhal
you find in the life of Richard the ſecond, of which author,
who lived in the raigne of Henry the ſixt, Iohn Leland in his
booke, De illuſtribus

was a man who ſo loved piety, that he neglected not good
letters, that he compiled many hiſtoryes with that faithfulneſſe,
that he ever was held a true Writer. Well then what
this true writer hath left recorded of Fryars untruthes, and
lea
                     •
                  ings, in his dayes, I am ſure the Fryars of our times will
make good, being nothing degenerate or inferiour unto
their predeceſſours in this winde; witneſſe this kingdome,
but eſpecially the Citty of Dublin; where, by their lying,
backbiting, &amp; detraction, they have purchaſed more beliefe,
eſpecially among the vulgar, then he that comes with the
goſpell of S. Iohn in his mouth. For whenſoever a Fryar is
diſpoſed by lying and back
                     •
                  iting to take away the good
name of a Prieſt, or any other man whoſoever, hee preſently

be takes himſelfe unto his begging vocation, which is a ſufficient
colour to bring him to any mans houſe, and ſo very
dextrouſly he can ſtop two ſhards with one buſh, for hee
can both begge and ſlander at one time. For ſay, his principall
buſines (&amp; that which he cheifly intends) is to defame,
&amp; to backbite his neighbour, yet his begging ſhall bee the
ſtalking horſe unto that foule buſineſſe, ſo as the detraction
ſhall onely ſeeme to come by way of diſcourſe &amp; communication,
accidentally. And this advantage hath the Friar of all
men in the world, who ſay they were malitiouſly minded, &amp;
intended never ſo much evill againſt their neighbour, yet
are they to ſeeke of an occaſion &amp; an excuſe to bring them
to this &amp; that bodies houſe, whereby they might vent the
poyſon &amp; malice of their hearts, of which pretext by reaſon
of his begging, the Friar is ever provided, and therefore in
flandering, backbiting &amp; defaming, whenſoever it pleaſeth
the Friar to be ſo wicked, (as I ſaid before) he hath the advantage
of all men upon earth. In confideration whereof I
leſſe muvaile at the ſpeech of a certaine Gentleman, who in
a familiar diſcourſe ſaid, that he had rather have the diſpleaſure
of any Nobleman in the country, then of the meaneſt
Fryar of any order: being aſked the reaſon thereof, he anſwered,
he would keepe that to himſelfe. And whence may we
thinke all theſe lyes &amp; tales with which this country (more
of late then ever heeretofore) is abuſed? I ſay from what
fountaine by all probability doe they deſcend, but from
theſe Fryar limitours, who paſſing from pariſh to pariſh,
from houſe to houſe, are lurking and ſcouting in every corner.
For albeit I confeſſe the needy beggar is alſo commonly
a lyar, yet neither hath he the wit, or the boldneſſe to vent
ſuch lewd repo
                     •
                  ts, neither (if he did) is there any ſo light of
beliefe, is to give credit unto him. No, no: it is not the wanting
beggar that ſits at the gate with a meſſe of broth, and a
piece of bread in his hand, who bruiteth all theſe lyes and
ſlanderous detractions of this, &amp; that party, whom they diſaffect,
but it is the wanton beggar who ſits above the ſalt,

becauſe he hath a better coat upon his back, &amp; authorized
by his profeſſion, which in this kingdome is made too often
a Pandor to wicked abuſes. And I am the rather induced
ſo to thinke, for that in this City of Dublin, we never yet
found any lye, or wicked ſlander made of a Clergy-man, but
when we got the end of the threed, and did winde up the
ſame to the bottome (as ſomtimes we have done) the other
end of it did alwayes hang at a Fryars tongue. And this
they are the more animated, &amp; encouraged to doe (I ſay, to
offer any abuſe or diſgrace to a Paſtor, or a Pariſh Prieſt, or any
other of the Clergy) for that no remedy in the earth can
be had againſt them. But why? Becauſe it is provided by
ſuch priviledges &amp; indults, as they have obtained from the
See Apoſtolick (which I doubt not but was at the firſt granted
them upon good conſideration) That upon all cauſes
(excepting hereſies, &amp; ſuch other enormous crimes reſerved
to the cognizance of the Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtrates) they
ſhall be convented before no other Iudges in primo inſtanti,
then their own Superiours; as Guardians, Priors, Rectors,
Provincials, and the like. And you know it is a Proverb, that
the clout will help the ſhooe. So as a man (though never ſo
highly wronged by a Friar) had better fit him down contented
then make a journey to the Friars Superiour, happily 20
or 30 miles from him, &amp; comming to his reſidence or Convent,
his Guardian ſhall either be at home, or from home;
within, or abroad; at leyſure, or not at leyſure; to be ſpoke
withall, or not to be ſpoke withall, even as it pleaſeth himſelf.
And let the plaintiff doe his beſt or his worſt, he ſhall be
ſure his ſatiſfaction ſhall never countervaile his labour, and
for one enemy he had before, he ſhall be ſure to purchaſe a
ſcore. I could be content to make a Catalogue of ſome part
of their lyes and ſlanders, were it not to avoyde prolixity, &amp;
that they are ſo incredible, as my ſelfe ſhould alſo incurre
the name of a lyar in relating them: wherefore I hold it better
to ſay my prayers with the Prophet David: Domine liber.
tanimam meam a labijs iniquis, &amp; à lingua doloſa: O Lord

deliver my ſoule from lying lips, &amp; from a deceitful tongue.
               And thus have you the firſt meanes of the oppreſſion of
the Clergy by our Friars, which conſiſts in making themſelves
ſtrong. The ſecond is, in making the Cleargy weake,
for upon theſe two Poles moves the Spheare of the Friars
Monarchy. Now to weaken the Cleargy there was held no
better courſe, then upon the vacancy of any Pariſh, either by
death, or otherwiſe, to annex that cure unto another, as we
ſee at this day, five or ſix pariſhes within the walls, with us
reduced unto two, or els in place of the dead (who was a
man of good talents and parts) to ſubſtitute ſome Arcadian
creature, who litle can ſay more then his Matins, &amp; he ſhall
undergo the Cure. For you know, the greater the Aſſe, the
greater burden is he able to beare, beſides (none more plyable
unto the humour of the Fryar) then he that is guilty of
little worth in himſelfe. So twixt the one &amp; the other, we
ſee of ten Pariſhes within &amp; without the walls, only remayning
five, while (in the mean time) the Fryars, in, &amp; about the
town, are multiplyed unto five ſcore: Beſides what they
have in the Countrey, &amp; not one of theſe, but what by his
owne endeavours, the ſtrength of his Order, the dependance
of his Devoto's, the countenance of our Franciſcan Archbiſhop,
is able to prevayle in right and wrong, againſt all our
Clergy in Dublin. For (God help us) at this day both Pariſh
Prieſts, &amp; all others of the Clergy, aſwell in the Suburbes,
as Citty of Dublin, ſcarce are wee ſo many perſons as
were in the Arke of Noah. Of which ſmall number, ſome
of them being called by the Ordinary, to have the care
of Pariſhes (and as themſelves know, and others can
witneſſe with them, neither for any deſert of learning,
or good life at all.) Others being the out-caſt of Regulars,
and without all hope of reentrance, being throwne out
as branne, (good enough in thoſe mens eyes, to make pariſh
Prieſts) entertained into the Archbiſhops favour by humouring
of his Friars, (who according to that rule of ſtate
pollicy commended by the Florentine divide et regna, make

a faction among thy ſubjects &amp; then be abſolute) he is willing
to make uſe of them, and to ſerve himſelfe of them, to
ruinate both themſelves and their fellowes, knowing by
how much more theſe ſilly men are obnoxious unto him,
and in his danger for ſome cauſes, he is the more aſſured of
them, as the fitteſt inſtruments of oppoſition unto the reſt
of the Clergy.
               
                  Charus erit Verri, qui Verrem tempore quo vult
                  Accuſare poteſt. Iuvenal. Sat. 3.
                  Deare he is to Verres, (though not for love, but feare,)
               
               Who Verres can accuſe, earth day, each month, each yeare.
For who are more officious, or more violent in perſecuting
of the Clergy &amp; their friends, then theſe men be, to whom
in a manner is committed the managing of the whole warre
againſt the Clergy, while the Biſhop and his Friars in the
meane while, laugh, &amp; looke on, to ſee how induſtrious we
be in ſupplanting one another, by whoſe diviſion in the Interim,
all the concourſe of the Laity is unto the Friars, enjoying
(to their great contentment) ſuch maintenance as was accuſtomed
to fall to the portion of the pariſh Prieſts. Thus
like unto the wax Candles upon their Altars, waſting themſelves
to give light unto others, they make way unto the
Friars Monarchy, ſhortly upon their ruines to be erected.
               Now this Epiſcopall, or Friarly perſecution of the poore
Clergy of this City, &amp; Dioceſſe; began with the comming in
of our preſent Archbiſhop, and the firſt tempeſt thereof,
diſburdened it ſelfe upon that worthy and moſt venerable
Prieſt, Fa. Iames Talbot then Vicar generall. A moſt learned,
pious, &amp; milde man, as all this Citty can witneſſe, et 
                        •
                     ujus memoria
fit in benedictione: about the ſame time it deſcended alſo
upon Fa. Patricke Cabil, Fa. Luke Roch ſort lately deceaſed,
&amp; a moſt worthy man: (For as any Clergy man was of
more eminency &amp; ſufficiency, in learning, piety, &amp; vertue, by
ſo much alwayes was he held more to ſtand in the Friars
light, for with theſe ever have beene our Friars warres, and

                  o
                     •
                   with others.) Till laſtly i
                     •
                  fell foule upon theſe two

Prieſts D. Peter Cadell, &amp; Paul Harris, in whom finding nothing
that he could reprehend; The Biſhop (by the Councell
of his Fryars) falls upon the moſt ingenious kinde of
perſecution, &amp; withall the moſt impious that ever in any age
was practiſed, yea, I challenge all antiquity, ſince the Aſcenſion
of our Saviour; to give an Example of the like. For firſt
attempting by Regall power, rather then Epiſcopall, to baniſh
them out his Dioceſſe, &amp; that without alledging any
cauſe againſt them, &amp; finding this not to ſucceed with him,
he then commaunds under paine of Excommunication, that
none ſhould be preſent at their Maſſes, knowing that nothing
could be more prejudiciall unto them, in regard of
their temporall maintenance, nor nothing leſſe troubleſome
unto the people. For what is it to forbeare the Maſſes of
two Prieſts (ſay they) when as with ſuch eaſe they may ſupply
that want among the Friars? So that upon the leaſt
ſcruple in the world, he wiſt well that would be obeyed.
And ſo by this one commaund he ſerves himſelfe of two notable
purpoſes. For firſt he deprives the Prieſts of their accuſtomed
maintenance: And by the ſame hee brings what
they ſhould have, unto his beloved Friars. For it is the cuſtome
(which he well knew) both of the Citty &amp; countrey
in theſe parts, that where the good people heare Maſſe, that
there one time or other, they leave ſome ſmall almes or offering,
according to their devotion. Heere, I confeſſe, was a
great deale of policy, but where was the Religion? Now
happily if any of more underſtanding &amp; judgment then the
common ſort did looke into this practiſe, &amp; condemning
in their minde theſe their proceedings, ſo ſiniſter &amp; unjuſt:
&amp; ſo in compaſſion of the innocent Prieſts, did make leſſe
account of the Ordinaryes cenſure, Then had he his Regular
                        •
                     
br
                        •
                     chium, the ſtrong aſſiſtance of his Eryars to do him ſervice,
&amp; to negotiat with the people, &amp; to accommodat that
buſine
                     •
                  . For the citizens can well witneſſe with us, how like
ſo many Bees our Friars did ſwarme about them, applying
them ſomtimes with the honey, ſomtimes with the ſting, as

beſt might ſerve their turne: In Confeſſion perſwading ſuch
as repaire unto them, &amp; never giving them abſolution, till
they have promiſed not any more to frequent the Maſſes of
the two Prieſts. Others who are ſlow in comming unto the
Friar, the Friar comes unto them, he viſites them in their
houſes, he tells them how ſuch a good friend of theirs remembers
their love unto them: he brings them a letter or a
token from ſuch a Friar of their kinred or acquaintance, and
wiſhes them to be adviſed by him: He proteſteth how well
he loves them; how much S. Francis or S. Dominick is beholding
unto them for their great charity &amp; almes; &amp; for their
parts, they pray continually for their happines &amp; proſperity,
both in this life, &amp; in the next. If they prevaile (as commonly
they doe) they have their intent. If they happen upon
others that are of a better head-piece, &amp; have a litle more
ſteele in their beards,, &amp; will not ſo eaſily be drawne with
their ſweet words: If he be a Merchant, they tell him plainly
he will looſe his cuſtome, &amp; neither they, nor any of their
friends will buy ought hereafter in his ſhop; and this they
will not ſtick openly to declare unto their Iourney-men &amp;
App
                     •
                  entices. The like they do unto the Tradeſ-men, Cooks,
Taylours, &amp; Shoe-makers: Nay, they will threaten the very
Tavernes, that they ſhall have no ſale of their Wine &amp; their
Beere, if they will adhere unto thoſe two Prieſts. (I write
nothing but what is well known through all the ſtreets of
Dublin.) Nay, &amp; they will be as good as their words: for
all our friends who wiſh us well, or gives us a meales meat,
or a lodging in their houſe, fares this day the worſe for us, &amp;
are partakers with us of this Friarly perſecution. And brother
againſt brother, the husband againſt the wife, the children
againſt the parents, &amp; one neighbour againſt another,
to the great diſturbance &amp; diſquiet, not only of the Church,
but even of the Commonwealth. And what doe we in the
mean time? neither perſwade, nor diſſwade, ſuch as come
unto us are welcome, and ſuch as leave us, God ſpeed them
well. As for the Friars, I confeſſe (if any of them durſt debate

the matter with us) we know what we have to ſay
unto them. But they rather apply themſelves to worke
upon other ſubjects, who are more eaſie to be deceived
by them, so the great ſcandall of the Church, and perdition
of ſoules.
               Well, to conclude this point; All had bin well, had our
Friars obſerved that wholſome exhortation of the Apoſtle,
&amp; made an application therof unto themſelves; A

all had bin in peace &amp; quietnes with us, had the Friars and
our Franciſcan Archbiſhop obſerved the lawes &amp; Canons
of the Church, &amp; according to his place had bin ready to
miniſter Iuſtice unto ſuch as wanted it, and ſo many times
ſought for it at his hands: For want of which Iuſtice, neither
Church, nor Common-wealth can long ſubſiſt, much
leſſe flouriſh. Iuſtice the cement of all humane ſocieties. Iuſtice
the baſis &amp; foundation of all governments. Iuſtice the
Queen of all morall vertues. Iuſtice which gives to every
man his own. Iuſtice, which (as Caſſiodorus ſaith) knowes
neither father nor mother, but only the truth. It accepteth
no perſon, it imitateth God. Iuſtice, Iuſtice cryes the Prieſt:
Peace, hold thy tongue, ſayes the Friar. The one ſtill laying
on, the other ſtill crying out: as having more reaſon to cry
for his beating, then the other to beat him for his crying.
But never will the Muſick be ſweet, betwixt them, till it be
ſet to Davids Harpe: Miſericordia, &amp; veritas, obviaverunt
ſibi: Iuſtitia, &amp; pax oſculata ſunt, Pſal. 84. Mercy &amp; truth have
met one another, Iuſtice and peace have kiſſed each other.
Which that it may, the God of Mercy and Truth, the God
of Iuſtice and Peace grant unto us.
            
            
               
               CAP. IX.
               The latter part of the Cenſure anſwered.
               
                  AS the firſt part of the Archbiſhops cenſure conſiſteth
in the excommunication of the Laity, for
hearing the Maſſes of the above-named Prieſts:
So the ſecond is in taking away, from them all
power &amp; juriſdiction of hearing Confeſſions, or miniſtring,
or doing any act or acts of the Paſtorall function within the
Dioceſſe of Dablin, as alſo annulling and making voyde all
Abſolutions hence forward by them to bee given. So the
Cenſure.
               To which I anſwer out of S. Thomas 2. 2. q. 104. 5. That the
Inferiour cannot limit the power of his Superiour: Not the
Captaine, of the Proconſull; nor the Proconſull, of the Generall.
And it is a Rule of the Canon; Quòd par in par
                        •
                     m non habet

                     s in ſuperiorem. An equall hath no commaund
over his equall, and much leſſe over his ſuperiour.
And it hath the conſent of all Doctors. Forſomuch then,
ſay the Prieſts, that they have received their power &amp; juriſdiction
in the premiſſes, not from their Ordinary, but from
the See Apoſtolicke, &amp; the fame power by the Archbiſhop
acknowledged, &amp; admitted for good &amp; authenticall, and ſo
many yeares practiſed in his Dioceſſe, he can not reſtrayne
their miſſionary power, till by the law &amp; authority of the
Church they be deprived thereof. And with this anſwere,
the Archbiſhop may content himſelfe, and deſiſt further to
encroach upon his ſuperiours juriſdiction, to whom he hath
as ſtrict an obligation of obedience, as the Prieſts have: And
this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of the Archbiſhops Cenſure,
and the Nullity thereof.
               Theſe Chapters following I

               Of the ſhamefull Avarice, and ſcandalous Begging
of our Fryars Mendicant, eſpecially in
this Kingdome of IRELAND:
               
                  SVrely, if our Archbiſhop had beene ſo
carefull of the good of his flocke, as in
his Excommunication is pretended, it
had beene a very methodicall charitie
for him to have begun at home with his
owne family, of his beloved Friars, and

                     •
                  o have reformed thoſe horrible &amp; infamous
abuſes among them, of which,
not onely this Dioceſſe, but the whole kingdome complaines,
groaning under the inſupportable burden thereof
I ſay it had beene very orderly for the Biſhop to have begun
his reformation at his owne houſe, knowing what the
Apoſtle ſaith. Si quis autem ſuae domni praeſſe neſcit, quomodo
Eccleſiae Dei diligentiam habebit. 1. Tim. 3. But hee who
knowes not, how to governe his owne houſe, how will hee
have care of the Church of God.
               For firſt: The rule of S. Francis commaunds, that his Fryars
ſhould worke, &amp; labour with their hands, &amp; ſuch among
them as know no trade or occupation, ſhould learne the
ſame, &amp; when they cannot ſufficiently maintaine themſelves
by the labour of their hands, then that it ſhould be lawfull
for them to begge: but how? not in Chappels or Oratoryes,
but oſtiatim from doore to doore. But to the end that none
ſhall ſay, that I ſpeake this of mine owne head, I will ſet you
downe S. Francis his owne words, as they iye in his Teſtament.
§. 5.
               
                  
                  Et ego manibus meis laborabam, &amp; volo laborare, &amp; omnes
alij fratres mei firmiter volo quod laborent, de laboritio quod pertinet
ad boneſtatem: &amp; qui neſciunt, addiſcant: non propter cupiditatem
recipiendi pretium laboris, ſed propter bonum exemplum,
&amp; ad repellandam otioſitatem, &amp; quando non daretur nobis pretium
laboris, recurramus ad menſam Domini petendo elemoſinam
oſtiatim. In Engliſh thus. And I (ſaith S. Francis) laboured
with my hands, &amp; will labour; &amp; all my other brethren I
firmely will, that they labour with their hands what pertaines
to honeſty: &amp; ſuch as know not, let them learne; not
for deſire of receiving a reward of their labours, but for
good example, &amp; to avoyde ſloath, &amp; when the price of our
worke is not given us, let us have recourſe unto the Table
of our Lord, asking almes from doore to doore. By which it
is manifeſt, that the bleſſed S. Francis intends not the labour
of the minde, in ſtudying to become learned, but manuall labour,
&amp; bodily worke, propounding the ſame unto them by
his own example: Et ego manibus me is laborabam, &amp; I (ſaith
he) laboured with my hands: neither can any ſay, that this is
only adviſed them by way of counſell, but rather abſolutely
commanded, for ſo ſaith the Saint, &amp; volo, &amp; I will that all
other my brethren labour de laboritio, by which word is ever
underſtood bodily labour.
               Now, if the Friars in their own defence, ſay, that it may
be ſo expounded, as extended unto the labour of
the mind, as well as of the body: Then (ſay I) they violat
another precept of their rule given them by S. Francis,
which is, that they are to make no gloſſe, commentary, or
expoſition, upon his rule, but to underſtand the words plainly
as they lye, &amp; this is commanded them under obedience,
in the laſt Paragraph ſaving one, of his Teſtament, in theſe
words: Et omnibus fratribus meis Clericis &amp; Laicis, praecipio
firmiter per obedientiam, ut non mittant gloſſas in Regulam, nec
in iſtis verbis, dicendo, Ita volunt intelligi, ſed ſicut Dominus dedit
mihi ſimpliciter &amp; purè dic ere &amp; ſcribere Regulam, &amp; iſta
verba, ita ſimpliciter &amp; purè ſine gloſſa intelligatis, &amp; cum ſancta

operatione obſervetis uſque in finem. The ſame in Engliſh is
thus. And I firmely commaund under obedience, all my Friars,
Clergy, and Laity, that they make no gloſſes upon the
Rule, nor in theſe words, ſaying: So they wil be underſtood;
but as our Lord gave me ſimply &amp; purely to ſpeak, and to
write the Rule, &amp; thoſe words, ſo ought you to underſtand
them, without a gloſſe, &amp; by holy operation obſerve them
unto the end.
               Now if our Friars tell us, That the Teſtament of S. Francis
is diverſe from his Rule, &amp; ſo not of that authority as to
bind them to that obedience and obſervation, as the Rule
doth. Then ſay I, Let S. Francis anſwer for himſelf in his ſaid
Teſtament §. 6. in theſe words: Et non dicant fratres, Haec eſt
alia Regula, quia haec eſt recordatio, admonitio &amp; exhortatio, &amp;
meum teſtamentum quod ego frater Franciſcus parvulus veſter
&amp; ſervus facio vobis fratribus meis benedictis, propter hoc, ut
regulam quam Domino promiſimus, melius catholicè obſervemus.
In Engliſh thus: And let not the Friars ſay, This is another
Rule, for that this is a remembrance, admonition, &amp; exhortation;
&amp; my will which I brother Francis, a little one, &amp;
your ſervant, doe make to you my bleſſed brethren, to this
end, that we may better Catholickly obſerve this Rule,
which we have promiſed unto our Lord.
               Laſtly, if the Friars ſay: That howſoever it be, yet they are
diſpenſed by authority of the See Apoſtolick, from the obſervance
of his Teſtament, &amp; conſequently, from any bodily
work or labour, other then it pleaſe themſelves. I anſwer: As
the Pope cannot diſpenſe with any commannd or Precept
of Canonicall Scripture; no more can he with the Rule of S.
Francis. If it be true which S. Francis wrote in his Will and
Teſtament, a little before his death: (And I truſt our Friars
will hold it a great ſin to ſay, S. Francis lyed) in theſe words,
Dominus dedit mihi ſimpliciter &amp; purè dicere &amp; ſcribere regulam,
&amp; iſta verba: Our Lord granted unto me, ſimply &amp; purely
to ſpeak &amp; write the Rule, &amp; theſe words: Teſtament §.
11. By which teſtimony of S. Francis, it appeareth, that as

well his Teſtament or Will which he made but two yeares
before his death, as his Rule before given unto his brethren
was indited by the Holy Ghoſt, &amp; ſo by divine authority
given unto him. Notwithſtanding the Friars of his Order
doe exempt themſelves from his Will &amp; Teſtament, &amp; the
obſervance thereof, &amp; conſequently from all bodily labour
therein cōmanded, &amp; contrary unto the expreſſe commaund
of the aforeſaid Will, they take upon them to procure gloſſes
&amp; expoſitions upon the Rule as alſo diſpenſations &amp; relaxations
from the See Apoſtolick. And this by vertue of
the Declarations of S. Gregory 9, &amp; Nicolaus 3. who (as they
ſay) have declared, that they are not bound to obſerve or obey
that Teſtament or Will of S. Francis, or the thiugs therin
contained. Thoſe Popes (it ſeemeth) were not of opinion,
That the Teſtament of S. Francis was of ſacred authority, or
canonicall Scripture, or that it was from Heaven, &amp; the Holy
Ghoſt inſpired into S. Francis. And ſo the Friars reſting
upon the aforeſaid Declarations, are well contented that ſo
it ſhould be believed. And therefore (ſay S. Francis what he
will, or what he can) begg they will, &amp; labour they will not;
for that is the more eaſie Trade of both; &amp; aucupium longe
queſtuofiſſimum, a moſt ready way to attaine, not onely to
meanes neceſſary, but to ſuch abundance, as wee ſee them in
all places to injoy. For firſt our Mendicant Orders have two
ſorts of Begging, like two ploughes ever walking. For firſt,
they paſſe thorough the Pariſhes, from houſe to houſe, not
contented to aske their almes at the doore, as S. Franeis commands
in his Will, &amp; was practiſed in his dayes, and in the
primitive times of his Order; for that is not Gentlemanlike,
but boldly will they ruſh into the Hall, &amp; from thence
into any other part of the houſe, more like unto Officers,
then poore Beggars: So haunting the richeſt ſort of people
for Money, Wheat, Muttons, Malt, Salt, Fiſh, Fleſh, for nothing
comes amiſſe; as they forget not the honeſt Farmer,
neither ſhall the poore Cotter eſcape them. And as Arma
                     
                        •
                     hanus
noted in his time, ſo ſhameleſſe, and importunate in

their begging, as if there be but two Cheeſes in the houſe,
they will carry them both away, or they will ſhame the owners.
And verily this which S. Richard of Dundalke writes
in his Defenſorium Curatorum, of the two Cheeſes, puts me
in minde of what lately we ſaw practiſed in the Countie of
Wexford, where a Friar comming to begge Muttons, a
poore Cotter, (having but only two,) out of his kind heart
told the Friar, he ſhould have one of them. Alas (quoth the
Friar) my honeſt friend, and what wilt thou doe with the other?
It will but ſtray from thee; give them both to GOD
Almighty. The poore man was content: And ſo GOD Almighty
(by the Friars help) got both the Muttons. But farre
be it from me to ſay, That this Friar was either a bold Beggar,
or avaricious at all.
               Their ſecond kind of Begging, as it is farre more compendious,
ſo much more commodious: for as their former Begging
ſeemed to, be but by retayle, by viſiting the good people
in their houſes; ſo this is altogether by whole-ſale, and
(as it were) in groſſe. And it is after this manner, though
uſed in no other Countrey (that ever I could obſerve) but
only in Ireland.
               The Friar betakes himſelf on Sondayes, on Holy-dayes, or
in Funeralls of the Dead, Moneth-mindes, Anniverſaryes,
Weddings, Patrons, &amp; the like, to ſuch places as the people
uſually reſort to Maſſe, &amp; there (either before, or after Maſſe)
he ſheweth himſelf in his habit; but (above all) he is very
carefull that he may begge before Maſſe; for he fore-ſeeth
that after Maſſe the people will ſcatter, &amp; ſo he ſhall faile of
his purpoſe. And therfore to prevent that inconvenience, he
commands that ſo ſoon as Maſſe is ended, the doores of the
Oratory, or of the Gentlemans Hall be ſhut, ſo as none may
paſſe forth, till ſuch time as he hav
                     •
                   uttered and ended his
Mendicatory ſpeech, which commonly is taken out of the
common-place of Liberality, Almes-deeds, works of mercy,
and the like: for example, facite elemoſynam, &amp; omnia
mund
                        •
                      funt vobis. Luk. 11. Give almes, &amp; all things are clean

unto you. Peccata tua elemoſy
                        •
                     is redime, et iniquitates tuas miſericordijs
pauperū. Dan. 4. Redeem thy fins with alms-deeds;
and thine iniquities with pity to the poore. Beatus qui intelligit
ſuper egenum, et pauperem, in die malâ liberabit cum Dominus.
Pſal. 40. Bleſſed is he who underſtandeth the caſe of the
poore &amp; needy, our Lord ſhall deliver him in the evill day.
This done, he expreſſeth unto them a catalogue of his wants,
&amp; there remembring, or at leaſt practizing, that ſaying of Seneca
the Tragedian in Thieſte. Qui timide rogat, docet negare;
he that aſketh faintly, teacheth how to deny; without any
ſhame or modeſty, he demaunds not as a Beggar, but rather
as a Commander: who will give them the Barrell of Wheat,
the Malt, the Muttons, &amp;c. If they come off to his liking, he
gives them his To giver lave, agus tuggi garo vanecht
                        •
                      yen
var vd. And turning himſelfe unto the Altar, upon his knees
he ſayes an Ave Maria: If he finde them tough and backeward,
then he fals a curſing them, accuſing the hardneſſe of
their hearts, &amp; their ſmall devotion, telling them; that it is
the very devill that poſſeſſeth their hearts, and ſtops their
tongues, &amp; will not ſuffer them to ſpeake. So as what with
his curſing, what with his bleſſing, what with the vaine-glory
that many of them take among their neighbours to bee
held liberall, what with the confuſion &amp; ſhame that others
are put unto, not to be thought ſo kind hearted (a great diſhonour
(I tell you) among the Iriſh) whoſoever looſeth the
Fryar he getteth. And thus hath the matter beene carryed
theſe yeeres paſt. But indeede of late I heare ſay, the caſe is
altered, &amp; no marvaile if with continuall blood-letting the
body in time grow both cold &amp; dry. For what thorough the
multitude of Fryars in this kingdome, who are growne, ſine
numero, pondere, &amp; menſura, without number, weight, &amp; meaſure,
in which three all things were created, as alſo many other
taxations from the ſtate, the commons are ſo impoveriſhed,
and oppreſſed, as now they are as unwilling to ſee a
Friar come among them to begge, as a Trooper to diſtraine,
&amp; to take up their pawnes. Inſomuch as in the Countrey the

good people, (though never ſo Catholicke &amp; devout,) they
will rather looſe Maſſe upon Sundayes &amp; Holydayes, then
they will come within a muſket ſhot of a Fryar, ſo much
they feare to be pounded up in a Gentlemans Hall, or in a
pariſh Chappell, as their Cowes uſe to be, when they treſpaſſe
upon their neighbours cornes. Thus are the Sacraments
prophaned: And that munda oblatio: that cleane offering
(propheſied of by Malachy. 1.) neglected, the ſervice
&amp; ceremonyes of the Church contemned. While in the eyes
of the people, either nothing, or nothing more is ſought after,
then the belly. For who is either ſo patient by nature, or
ſo irreligious for want of breeding, as he can endure a Friar
limitour in a publicke audience, (when he findes the people
ſometimes, not to anſwer his expectation in giving of
almes) to utter theſe wordes. Well and doe you depart the
the place, &amp; give me nothing? From the richeſt to the pooreſt
thoſe who leave no almes with me, I will take from
them the grace and benefite of that Maſſe which this day
they have heard. This prophane &amp; Symoniacall ſpeech was
uttered by a Franciſcan in the Dioceſſe of Meath, &amp; the ſame
very lately. And if any of his order will queſtion the truth
thereof, let him either come, or ſend unto me, &amp; I will give
him ſuch ſatiſfaction as he ſhall returne aſſured of the truth,
of what I have reported. For as old Eleazarus ſaid, 2. Macab.
6. Non enim aet

yeeres to forge, &amp; much leſſe my profeſſion to ſlander. For
let the world thinke or ſpeake of me what they pleaſe I intend
the reformation of what is amiſſe, which were I ſo
happy as to effect, I would then offer up a ſilver pen, not to
Apollo &amp; the Muſes, but to the honour of my Saviour, in this
or the like verſe.

               But this may not be done, till I have told another Fryar

Altar, cauſing him to yeeld unto himſelfe the firſt time and
place of begging, on which both Maſſe, Prieſt, and People,
muſt attend, as if the Friar ſhould ſay, with the Satiriſt.

               And ſo the divine &amp; fearefull myſteries being celebrated
at no canonicall houre, the people are diſmiſſed at two a
clocke, to go home to dinner. And if the pariſh Prieſt ſeeme
to be diſpleaſed with the Friars behaviour, or give the leaſt
impediment unto his begging, he ſhall be threatned Excommunication,
by vertue of his Priviledges, or elſe by the
Biſhop of the Dioceſſe, to be diſcharged of his place. As we
have lately ſeene practiſed in the Dioceſſe of Kildare, under
their Dominican Biſhop.
               The conſideration of theſe our miſerable times in Ireland
doth often make me to thinke, &amp; to reflect of the dayes of
Heli the Prieſt, 1. Reg. 12. where the Scripture ſayeth, Porrò
filij Heli, filij Belial, neſcientes Dominum, ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      officium Sacerdotum
ad populum. &amp;c. Moreover the Sonnes of Heli, were
the Sonnes of Belial, neither knowing our Lord, nor the duty
of Prieſts unto the people, &amp;c: by whoſe baſe greedineſſe,
as you may read in the place above cited, it is ſaid. Quòd retrahebant
homines à ſacrificio Domini. They did withdraw
the people from the ſacrifice of our Lord, which example of
Ophni &amp; Phinees the two Sonnes of Heli, in preferring the
fleſh pots before the ſacrifices of God, is ſet forth unto us a
moſt lively type &amp; figure of our Friar Mendicants, who in
what abundance ſoever they live (whoſe apparell, horſes, &amp;
foote-boyes, argues rather ſuperfluity then poverty) yet
begge they will, &amp; begge they muſt, &amp; that, (as before hath
beene noted) with ſuch immodeſty, as all preſent but themſelves,
are much aſhamed of them, making the people either
to loathe, or at leaſt to forbeare their duty to God, and in
truth to conceive that all our▪ Religion is but to ſerve our

owne turnes. Thoſe who doubt of the truth of my ſpeeches,
let them but upon ſome Feſtivall day, walke unto the next
Villages, as Cromlin, Caſticknock, Palmerſton, or Lucan, &amp;c.
and they ſhall be both eye &amp; eare witneſſes of much more
then I have ſaid. But &amp; if they will take the paines to make
a journey ſo farre as Connagh, then I will promiſe them that
there they ſhall find our Friars rather latrones, then mendicos,
more to ſmell of the Theefe, then of the Beggar. For
without any leave or liking of the honeſt Farmer, they will
make bold to ſearch his Arkes, &amp; hutches of Corne, Meale,
Malt, &amp; thence to take away what they pleaſe, for who can
controll them? Moreover, I am credibly informed by divers
of very good note in thoſe parts
                     •
                   That many times they
will drive together all their neighbours ſheepe into one
fold, &amp; knowing every mans marke, they will chooſe out
what Muttons they like (and I beſhrew them if they take
not the fatteſt) &amp; who is he that dare ſay, they doe amiſſe?
To ſuch a potency they are growne (even in a ſhort time)
in this Kingdome, that they are become not only terrible
unto the people, but not to be ruled by the lawes of the
Church, and the inſtitutes of their owne Orders.
               And even as in the dayes of King Henry 8, of late memory,
the manifold abuſes not onely of the Laity, but even of
Church men, did caſt them out of theſe Kingdomes, and
brought that deſolation upon them, which to this day their
poſterity doth inherite. So let us never thinke to repayre
our ruines, with thoſe exceſſes, and diſorders, which were
the cauſes of thoſe ruines. For doubtles the ſame cauſes, ſooner
or later, will have the ſame effects. Now certaine it is,
that as ſome of the Eccleſiaſticall order might be tainted
with much pride &amp; ambition, by meanes of their great plenty
&amp; abundance, &amp; not free alſo from covetouſneſſe, yet the
Mendicant orders according to the courſe of mans naturall
corruption, are more prop
                     •
                  nſe and inclined unto the dropſie
of Avarice, &amp; ſuch vices, as follow thereupon, th
                     •
                  n either
the Clergy, or any other eſtate &amp; condition of men, who having

a competency of ſome ſettled meanes, may well attend
their vocation with tranquillity, &amp; contentment of minde,
(I ſay, their mediocrity of meanes under God, defending
them from too much anxiety, and care of future wants.)
When as the Friar Mendicant, being habituated in begging,
&amp; continuall receiving of almes, &amp; expectation of uncertain
gifts, dwels ever in cares houſe, his wants as well imaginative,
as reall, like unto two fore-ſwarty forge-men, ſtill beating,
&amp; hammering upon the head-piece of his imagination,
permitting him not to take any reſt, yea without a ſpeciall
degree of Gods grace, the beggar is ever ſad, melancholy,
humorous &amp; greedy, nor ordinarily ſo well provided as
he ought to rely upon that providence, which ever takes
place of humane diligence. For example, give a convent of
Fryars, though but of 20. perſons, five hundred pounds in
almes this day (which is a faire proportion) you ſhall ſee
them to morrow as induſtrious in begging, as if you had
given them but ten ſhillings. For even as Hawkes halfe
gorged are more eager of prey, then theſe which are kept
faſting, ſo fareth it with the Mendicants, who looke not ſo
much to what they have allready gotten, as what they have
not yet obtained, nor what for the preſent they enjoy, as
what in time they may come to want. Nay the Friar though
never ſo well accommodated, abounding on every ſide, with
rich kinred, friends &amp; Benefactours, amidſt his owne nation
where probably he can never come to looke neceſſity in
the face, &amp; having alſo Dominus vobiſcum, as a ſure buckler
(in the hands of a man of good comportment) to defend
him alſo from want: yet compare this Friar Mendicant not
now to a Clergy man (as we have already done) but even unto
the needy beggar, who hath plenty of nothing, but of
want, you ſhall ſee the one well contented with a piece of
bread, to ſatiſfie his hungry b
                     •
                  lly, or a paire of broken ſtockings,
or an old ſhoe to his foot, when as the other beggar
will not ſticke to aſke you an horſe of eight or ten pounds
price, &amp; if you deny him, he will ſhew much more diſcontent,

then the other beggar who is denyed a piece of peaſe
bread, after which his hungry belly roares; but if it ſo fall
out, as your horſe which you refuſed to beſtow on the Friar
miſcary, or come to any miſchance, &amp; ſo periſh, why then
the owner is rightly ſerved, ſince he denyed him the Fryar.
Some reading theſe lines will better underſtand them then
others. A Merchant of my acquaintance, and living at this
day in this Citty of Dublin, refuſed to give a Friar a barrell
of Beefe, who of my knowledge was in leſſe neceſſity thereof,
then the Merchant himſelfe, conſidering his charge of
wife &amp; children: ſoone after the Merchant (being his owne
Factour) embarked himſelfe with his Beefe, and other Merchandiſe
for France, upon the ſeas he meetes with a ſtorme,
&amp; it was thought neceſſary for their ſafety to lighten the
ſhip, &amp; to caſt over-board ſome part of the Beefe, it pleaſed
God (the tempteſt ceaſing) they held on their voyage without
any more hurt. But what ſaid the Friar and his fellowes
when newes came to towne? forſooth, it was the juſt judgment
of God that he ſhould bee forced to throw that Beefe
into the ſea, which he would not beſtow on them. So as in
feare of theſe enſuing calamities incident unto our wretched
mortality &amp; uncertaine eſtate of life, in this vale of miſery.
What man of trade or occupation, but eſpecially what
Merchant Venturer, or Sea-faring man, dare deny theſe Mendicant
Orders what they aſke? for he ſhall be ſure the next
calamity or miſfortune ſhall be ſet upon the ſkore of that refuſall.
But ſince many an Agnus Dei, many a graine, &amp; many
a medall, &amp; Relick lyes buried in the bottom of the Sea, thogh

many heavy markets as thoſe who adhere unto the poore

                     •
                  alendars
of obſervations ſoever they make to the contrary.
               And verily in this Nation more liberall (I confeſſe) and
kind hearted, then may well ſtand with their meanes, albeit

withal, more ſuperſtitious &amp; credulous to believe faſcinati
                     •
                  s,
ey-bitings, &amp; old propheſies, thē wel may ſtand with true piety
&amp; Religion, with which they are ſo over-awed, that nothing
(in a manner) dare they refuſe, (I ſpeak of the ſimpler
ſort) that the Friar caſts an affection unto; for being once
asked and denyed, they are perſwaded that it will periſt
from them, &amp; never do them good. Neither ſtands it with
the Friars profit to remove this &amp; the like opinions from
the peoples minds; quaerentes magis quae ſua ſunt, quam quae
ſunt Chriſti Domini, rather ſeeking themſelves, then what is
our Lord Chriſts; as dayly experience teacheth, and as the
Apoſtle ſpake of ſome in his time, Philip. 2.
               Now as for their Propheſies: If any diſaſter or miſhap befall
to any man or woman, who is not ſo much devoted unto
their order, or not ſo kind unto them, as they deſire, preſently
the Friar divulges among the people, that either himſelf, or
ſuch another Friar of his Order, did propheſie ſuch things to
befall them: As likewiſe if any of their Benefactours receive
any temporall bleſſing, profit, or emolument more then Ordinary,
it ſhall be imputed either to the prayers, or propheticall
predictions of ſome Friar, as if GOD Almighty
would keep nothing ſecret from them, nor diſpoſe either of
his bleſſings or puniſhments, but by their miniſtery and diſpenſation.
And among other of their propheſies, there is
none ſtronger among the Friar Minors, then that in this
Kingdome, the Church ſhall one day be ruled by their Order,
which propheſie they well weened (about ſixe yeares agone)
had bin fulfilled, when as (of the foure Arch-biſhops)
three of them at one time were Franciſcans▪ namely Hugh
Cavall of Armagh, Tho. Flemming of Dublin, Florence
of T
                     •
                  me; but two of them being ſoone after called out
of this life, did fruſtrate their expectation for that time. As
for their propheſies of the fates &amp; deſtinyes of ſuch as oppoſe
themſelves unto their vices, (of whom among others,
my ſelf am now become a ſubject) I leſſe regard their auguries,
&amp; divinations, for that I dayly ſee, that themſelves doe

not fore-ſee their own diſaſters &amp; calamityes, forſomuch as
divers among them have not had ſo auſpicious fates as they
could have wiſhed, &amp; yet had not the skill to fore-tell the
ſame. And albeit I am dayly fore-warned by my friends, to
looke carefully unto my ſelf, &amp; to be upon my keeping, leſt
ſuch as areed my deſtiny, be alſo the Procurers of my deſtiny;
yet the leſſe diligence do Iuſe therein: for that I have
learned, Niſi Dominus cuſtodierit civitatem, fruſtra vigilant qui
cuſtodit eam. Pſal. 126. Vnleſſe our Lord preſerve the City, he
watcheth in vaine who keeps the ſame. And as a great Prince
in our time, (upon the murder of Henry 3. of France) being
moved by his Councell, to take unto himſelf a guard for the
greater ſecurity of his perſon, anſwered; Bien eſta guardado
aquien Dios guarda: He is well guarded whom God protects.
Almighty God of his infinit mercy grant (what fate
ſoever befall me) that I may live &amp; dye his ſervant, and the
ſame I wiſh unto my greateſt adverſaryes. And forſomuch
as I am arrived (ſince I writ this book) unto the yeares of
ſixty, and am perſwaded (both by reaſon of my age, &amp; manifold

               CAP. II.
               The doctrine of our Archbiſhop and Friars refuted,
who maintaine, That Civill actions againſt
Clergy-men, are to be determined
by the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe.
               
                  TRue it is that regularly ſpeaking, the Canon
&amp; lawes of the Church require, that all cauſes
as well Eccleſiaſticall, Criminall, as Civill,

                     〈◊〉
                   determinable by the Ordinary, whenſoever
the Defendant is a man of the Clergy,
Concil. Chalcedon. can. 9. Concil. Agathenſe
can. 32. Concil. Carthag. 3. can. 9. Tolletan. 3. can. 13.
               But to this I anſwer, That as many other Canons &amp; lawes
were never received in other parts of the Church, no more
was this, at leaſt for that laſt part of Civill cauſes in England
or Ireland, ſince the firſt converſion of the Natious heere by
S. Patricke, there by S. Gregory. Neither let any thinke it

ſtrange, that a generall canon &amp; law of the Church, in ſome
parts of the Church be received, in others not. Forſomuch
as the Canon it ſelf tels us, that a Law may looſe his ſtrength
and force of binding three manner of wayes.
               Firſt, where the ſame was never approved or received: Becauſe
(ſaith the Law) Leges inſtituuntur, cùm promulgantur;
confirmantur dum approbantur. 4. diſt. in iſtis 
                        •
                     . prox. Lawes are
then ordayned, when they are publiſhed; but confirmed
when they are approved.
               Secondly, if (by a later law) the former be diſannulled e. 1.
de Conſt. in 6. So S. Aug. poſterior canon corrigit priorem: The
later Canon corrects the former.
               
                  Laſtly, if by a contrary cuſtome, which is reaſonable, it be
abrogated. Locorum conſuetudines ubi rationabiles ſunt, juri
ſcripto derogare poſſunt. cap. Dilecti 4. de arbitris c. 2. Ext. de
Conſ
                        •
                     ot
                        •
                     dinibus. The cuſtomes of places (being reaſonable)
may derogate from the law written.
               Now then I ſay, That cauſes meerely Civill, as Debts, Inheritances,
Pawnes, Morgages, Leaſes, Rents, Annuities, Penſions,
Purchaſes, Sales, and the like; ſo often as Prieſts and
Clergy-men were to be Defendants in all times, as well under
the government of the Saxon, as Norman Kings, were
determinable by the Common-law, &amp; never in any Eccleſiaſticall
Court at all. So as it ſeemes unto me, that law of the
Church was either never received, which in theſe Civill actions,
drawes the plea unto the Court of the Ordinary,
(which I rather believe.) Or if it were at any time in obſervance,
by cuſtome beyond all memory, it was abrogated.
Neither need we ſo much to marvaile heereat, ſince it is the
common opinion of Divines, that the exemption of Clergymen,
as well in reſpect of their perſons, as their goods, from
ſaecular tribunalls, was at the firſt introduced by humane, &amp;
not divine law. So S. Greg. lib. 11. epiſt. 54. doth no otherwiſe
prove, that a Prieſt ought not to be impleaded before a temporall
Iudge, but becauſe Iustinian the Emperour had ſo ordained

                     •
                  . Read Card. Bellar. tom. 1. Controverſiarum, printed

at Leons in France 1587. lib. de Clericis cap. 28. But for the
further clearing of this point: Forſomuch, as I am in the
Negative, &amp; our Archb. with his Friars in the Affirmative.
If they will maintaine, that the law above cited in the beginning
of this Chap. was ever in viridi obſervantia, in due
practiſe within theſe Kingdomes of England &amp; Ireland: I
ſay, it is their parts by examples of Caſes pleaded, of Iudgments,
&amp; Sentences, in ſuch &amp; ſuch Eccleſiaſticall Courts of
Biſhops, or their Vicar Generalls, or their Chancellours, to
ſhew out of ſome auncient Records of the afore-named
Courts &amp; Tribunals, what may make for the confirmation
of their cauſe, which I aſſure my ſelf they ſhall never be able
to doe; no not ſo much as to afford us one onely preſident,
though nothing be more common in the Common-law,
then Biſhops, Abbots, Prieſts, &amp;c. convented in the temporall
Courts, in Civill cauſes, even in the beſt &amp; moſt Catholick
times, no leſſe then at this day. Hence are thoſe Writs
of temporall Courts unto the Diocaeſan Biſhops, venire facies
Clericum, as alſo the Writs of Prohibition unto Eccleſiaſticall
Iudges, as ancient as our common-lawit ſelf, which
like unto Melchiſedeck, knowes neither father nor mother.
               Why then doth our Archbiſhop Thomas Flemming aliàs
Barnwell, together with his Friars, noyſe it up and downe
both Citty &amp; Countrey, That A. B. Prieſt, is excommunicated

                     
                        •
                      jure for calling C. D. Prieſt into the Court of the
Kings Bench, for detayning &amp; with-holding certaine of his
Bookes from him moſt injuriouſly, as was determined lately
by the Lord Chief Iuſtice? (eſpecially the aforeſaid Prieſt
A B. firſt having made his complaint unto his Ordinary,
the aforeſaid Archbiſh. &amp; could not be heard.) Shall we ſay,
That our Archbiſhop and Friars are either more wiſe, more
learned &amp; vertuous then the Biſhops, Paſtours, Prieſts, &amp; the
whole Clergy for ſo many hundred yeeres paſt: ſo many
Kings, Iudges &amp; Iuſtices: in whoſe Tribunals that courſe
hath ever beene held? O no, I cannot bee of that minde, but
that theſe were as well ſeene in all Lawes divine &amp; humane,

&amp; as obedient children of the Church, and as reſpective of
the Cenſures thereof, as we their poſterity be. To conclude
then this point, I confidently avouch, and will maintaine againſt
theſe our Innovatours, who labour to infringe the
auncient Lawes, &amp; immemorable cuſtomes hitherto from
our very cradle of Chriſtianity received, allowed, and practiſed
both by the Church and Common-wealth, in theſe
his Majeſties Kingdomes; That they declare themſelves by
ſuch their audacious attempts, neither to be good members
of the Church, nor yet good ſubjects unto his Majeſty.

of the Order of S. Francis, uſurpet is a power never before
heard of in this Kingdome, to wit, at his pleaſure to
baniſh the Kings ſubjects, not onely out of his
Dioceſſe, but out of his Province.
               
                  IT is ſaid, That Exilium eſt mors civilis; Baniſhment
is a civill death: And therefore in all reaſon
not to be inflicted but by lawfull authority, and
for very grievous offences. And firſt it is confeſſed
by all Divines, that Epiſcopall power in puniſhments, is
confined to the three Cenſures, of Excommunication, Suſpenſion,
&amp; Interdict; according to that of the Apoſtle, Nam
arma militiae noſtra non car
                        •
                     alia ſunt, &amp;c. 2. Cor. 10. For the
weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but powerfull to revenge
all diſobedience, &amp;c. For which cauſe Excommunication
the firſt &amp; ſharpeſt of all the cenſures, is called Mucro
Epiſcopi, the Biſhops ſword. Now if the Biſhop will ſay
with S. Peter. Ecce d
                        •
                     o gladij, behold two ſwords, It muſt be
knowne from whom hee hath that other, his owne being
ſpirituall, and it is acknowledged by Divines that hee borroweth
it from the civill Magiſtrate, from Princes &amp; Temporall
Governours, who as good children of the Church,

were enduced to grant this temporall aſſiſtance, onely in
ſome caſes, unto the Paſtor, for the better government of his
flocke in his Spirituall regiment. And ſo it came to paſſe
that priſons were allowed unto Biſhops, wherein not only
to detaine, but alſo to chaſtiſe Herètickes, Simoniſts, Blaſphemers,
prophaners of the Sacraments, vow breakers, contemners
of the faſts of the Church, &amp; Holy-dayes, violators
of Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, and the like, as alſo for faults not
of ſo bad a note, to inflict pecuniary mulcts &amp; fines at their
diſcretion, yet wee finde not that Biſhops or Prelats (who
beſides their ſpirituall juriſdictiō are not temporall Princes,
either in whole, or in part) doe corporally puniſh, either
theft, or murders, or treaſons, or rapes, or blood-ſhed, with
infinite other offences, which are dayly committed in all
common-wealthes. So never doe we finde by any record or
regiſter of any Eccleſiaſticall court. That in theſe Kingdomes
either with cauſe, or without cauſe, it was permitted by the
Church unto Archbiſhops, or Biſhops, or ever did they exerciſe
the paine of baniſhment, either out of their Provinces
or Dioceſſes. It being a power meerely temporall, and Regall,
&amp; never committed unto them, no more then puniſhments
of death, loſſe of lim, forfeyture of houſe, &amp; land, &amp;c.
Nay if it be law which Sir Edward Cooke reports in his
comment upon Littleton lib. 2. cap. Villinage ſect. 200. No
ſubject may be baniſhed out of the Kingdome, but by Parliament
authority, for what cauſe or crime ſoever. Shall then
our Archbiſhop who borrowes his temporall power, &amp; juriſdiction,
from the King, aſſume the like authority? But to
this it will be ſaid, That the Archbiſhop onely exiles out of
his Dioceſſe, or at the moſt out of his Province, not out of
the whole land. To which I anſwere, but in caſe the foure
Archbiſhops of this Kingdome ſhould agree (as within
theſe ſixe yeeres, three of them at one time were gray Fryars)
to baniſh a man each one out of his Province, is he not
then baniſhed the whole Kingdome of Ireland? and with
leſſe difficulty might this be done in England, where wee

have only two Provinces, &amp; two Archbiſhops, Canterbury,
and Yorke. And (I trow) it is no hard matter for two to agree.
But that which is moſt ſtrange, &amp; not to be believed,
were it not that it was done in the hearing of many witneſſes,
&amp; in this Citty of Dublin againſt parties living, and who
at this day remaine in this Citty, (albeit I ſpare to name
them.) I ſay, ſo it was, &amp; will be juſtified that this preſent
Archbiſhop Friat Thomas Flemming aliàs Barnwell, did by
ſentence baniſh out of his Dioceſſe, men of the Clergy, commanding
them under Cenſures within 15. dayes to depart
the ſame: &amp; being demanded wherein they had offended, or
what they had committed deſerving ſuch puniſhment. He
anſwered, that he knew no hurt by them, but that he had no
uſe of them, slbeit verily he had uſe enough of them, had he
bin pleaſed to make uſe of them, for they were of the moſt
learned men of his Dioceſſe. And whom a vertuous Prelat
would have eſteemed as his own eyes, &amp; much leſſe have baniſhed.
But ſo the times are, that learning, vertue, and good
breeding, are ſo farre from being ſtayres to honour and preferment,
as nothing can ſooner (with this Ordinary) work
his diſgrace, his dejection &amp; utter over-throw: well then,
the Archbiſhop ſtands ſtiffe in this doctrine: That he can ad
nutum, &amp; ad libitum, baniſh any Prieſt out of his diſtrict;
which doctrine were it true, what man (I pray you) would
take upon him the vocation of a Clergy-man, or of a Secular
Prieſt, knowing that ever after he muſt be a perpetuall ſlave
to humour his Ordinary, or elſe not to live in the Church:
for what one Biſhop can doe, another may doe. And a Prieſt
by this meanes may be baniſhed out of all Chriſtendome;
when as a Miller, or a Baker, or a Porter, will aske never a Biſhop
in the land leave ro dwell in his Dioceſſe. So much do
our ſacred Orders help us, as rather they help to undoe us?
Say, is not this to dominari in Clerum, to tyrannize over the
Clergy? Is not this to encroach upon Regall authority? Is
not this to confound all lawes both of Church &amp; Commonwealth?
Wherefore for my part I allow very well of that

Prieſt, my deare friend &amp; Countrey-ma
                     •
                  , who being commanded
above two yeares agoe by the aforeſaid Tho. Flemming
alias Barnwell, to depart his Dioceſſe, alledging no
cauſe againſt him: He anſwered, My Lord, I will not baniſh
you the Dioceſſe, neither ſhall you me; for ſo long as the
King &amp; the State are pleaſed to permit me, I will heere injoy
the foure Elements, &amp; if any give me

nights lodging, I will take it, &amp; be thankfull for the ſame: &amp;
ſo ſaying, me thought he ſpake as my ſelf would have done
in the like caſe. Neither by this do I intend to deny Exile
to be a canonicall puniſhment, but not uſed either by Eccleſiaſticall
or Civill Magiſtrates in theſe Kingdomes, nor yet
any-where elſe, without ſome great &amp; haynous off

of that Speech which my ſelf lately made in a publick audience,
as followeth.
               Let me alſo ſignifie unto you, That none of you preſume
or ſeek to maintaine Tho. Flemming aliâs Barnwell, Archb. &amp;
a Friar of the Order of S. Francis, in his late uſurped authority
of Exile, or baniſhment, where in he takes upon him only
at his pleaſure, &amp; at his will, omni indictâ cauſâ, to baniſh, and
throw out of his Dioceſſe any perſon whatſoever, either
of the Clergy, or Laity, which doctrin he hath both publickly
taught, as alſo of late practiſed on divers perſons, to the
great diſturbance both of the Church &amp; Common-wealth:
It being a meere uſurpation, contrary unto the Canons and
the ancient ſtatutes of this Kingdome. And therfore it concernes
us all (as good ſubjects) to maintaine our King in his
Right, againſt all innovation whatſoever; for in ſo doing
we ſhall fulfill the commaund &amp; will of our Saviour, ſaying;
Give

               Of certaine moſt dangerous Hereſies, or rather Blasphemies,
of late preached and publiſhed by 
                     •
                  riars,
of, and within the Dioceſſe of Dublin,
to the perdition of many ſoules.
               
                  TRuely if our Archbiſhop had bin ſo tender
over his flock, &amp; ſo carefull of their ſoules,
as in this his Excommunication is pretended,
knowing, that as it is the part of a
good Paſtour, to feed the people committed
unto his charge, with wholſome doctrine, &amp;
the food of the Sacraments; ſo alſo to chaſe away the
Wolfes, eſpecially thoſe Wolfes which our Saviour foretold,
ſhould come in Sheepes cloathing, which are the moſt
dangerous Wolves of all other. I ſay, had theſe two points
bin well conſidered of, by our Paſtour, he doubtleſſe would
have bin more diligent &amp; frequent in his Sermons and exhortations
unto the people, as in perſwading them unto
good life, &amp; obſervance of Gods Commandements, (a doctrin
very neceſſary) ſo in their faith confirming them againſt
all tempeſts of perſecution which may ariſe. If happily
he alledge in omiſſion of this duty, That he leaves the
charge of that office to his Pariſh Prieſts, &amp; to his Fryars. I
anſwer with Cardinall Bellarmine in his book entituled Gemitus
Columbae, lib. 2. cap. 4. It is not to be underſtood, that
the aſſiſtants ſhould ſo labour, as the principall ſhould be
idle &amp; do nothing. Our bleſſed Saviour had his Apoſtles to
help him, as learned (I trow) and as laborious, as either our
Pariſh Prieſts, or Fryars, &amp; yet himſelfe, as the principall Paſtour,
refuſed no paines or labour to comply with his miſſionary
office of preaching, which he had from his Father,
Luke 4. Spiritus Domini fuper me, propter quod n
                        •
                     xit me, evangelizare
pauperibus miſit me: The Spirit of God upon me, for

which cauſe he annointed me, &amp; ſent me to preach the Goſpell
unto the poore, according to which miſſion from his
Heavenly Father, he did ſo attend his Office of Preaching (as
the Goſpell reports of him) That he travailed from Citty to
Citty, from place to place, preaching the Kingdome of God,
&amp; that not only in the Temple of God, but in the fields, in
the deſerts, in the mountaines, upon the ſea, in private houſes,
ſitting at the table, walking upon the high-way, at all
times, &amp; in all occaſions remembring that he was ſent to
preach.
               So after him the Apoſtles, to whom Biſhops ſucceed, they
declare that this was their Office. The Apoſtle 1. Cor. 9. 
                     Ʋae
mihi ſi non evangelizavero, Woe unto me, if I doe not preach
the Goſpell. And admoniſhing Timothy a Biſhop, he ſaith:
Praedica verbum, inſta opportune, importunè, argue, obſecra, increpa,
in omni patientia, &amp; doctrina, 1 Tim. 3. Preach the Word,
be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, convince, beſeech, reproove,
in all patience &amp; doctrine. Such was the practiſe of
S. Iohn the Apoſtle; who frequented the Pulpit in his decrepit
yeeres, as witneſſeth S. Hierom in the third Booke of
his Commentaryes upon the Epiſtie unto the Galathians.
And the ſame the 4. Councell of Carthage declared, teaching
that a Biſhop ſhould attend unto Prayer, to reading, &amp; to the
preaching of the Word of God. To which S. Gregory accordeth,
lib. 2. Epiſt. 39. Epiſcopi eſt, de praedicationis miniſterio 
                        •
                     ogitare:
It is a Biſhops part to thinke of the miniſtery of
preaching. And ſo it ſeemes that our auncient Biſhops did
very well underſtand the ſame for many ages together. Forſomuch
as moſt of the writings of S. Cyprian. S. Athanaſius,
S. Baſil, S. Nazianzen, S. C
                        ••
                     yſoſtome, S. Ambroſe, S. Cyrill, S.
Auguſtinus, S. Maximus, S. Leo, S. Gregory, and others,
were nothing elſe but Sermons preached unto the people.
And if the ſame obligation did not alwayes remaine; wherfore
to this day in putting into their hands a Bible is it ſaid
in the Conſecration of Biſhops? Accipe Evangelium, vade,
praedica populo tibi commiſſo: Take the Goſpell, goe preach to

the people committed unto thee. And if our Biſhops in
theſe dayes were not bound to preach, wherefore doth the
late Councell of Trent tell us, that among all Epiſcopall duties
the office of Preaching is the chiefe? Seſſ. 5. &amp; 24.
               But our Biſhop will happily ſay, That his talent is not in
preaching, and making
                     •
                  , of Sermons. To which (I ſay)
though he be not able to preach and make a formall Sermon,
at leaſt, why (as occaſion offereth it ſelfe) doth he not
in ſome ſhort exhortations move the people to good life,
ſetting before their eyes the reward of vertue, &amp; the deformity
of vice, as alſo its puniſhments: or at leaſt, why teacheth
he not the Chriſtian doctrine, which in truth is the beſtkinde
of preaching, and moſt neceſſary in this kingdome of
all other, where ſuch ignorance raigneth among the common
people, that if every haire of our heads, were preachers
or teachers of the Catechiſme, it were little enough? But and
if our Archbiſhop, bee not either able, or not willing to
preach, &amp; to feede his flocke, with the ſpirituall food of the
word, wherefore then did he condiſcend to accept of a Biſhopricke,
knowing himſelfe ſo unmeet for the ſame? or
what account will he give up to the Prince of Sheepheards,
when it ſhall be required at his hands? Happily they may
have enough to doe, to anſwer for themſelves. He layes the
burden upon their neckes, they will ſay they were but aſſiſtants
unto him: Now as that learned Cardinall ſaith, non adjuvari
dicitur, qui nihil facit. Hee is not ſaid to be aſſiſted,
which doth nothing himſelfe. Againe in his treatiſe de gemitu

                      (inquiunt) multi ſunt hoc
tempore praedicatores verbi Dei, ex ordinibus religioſis; verum
eſt illud quidem, ſed illi vocati ſunt in adjutorium Epiſcoporum,
non ut proprium munus ipſorum impediant. To conclude (ſaith
he) they will ſay, that at this time there be many preachers
of Gods word among religious Orders, true it is, but they
be called to be helpers to the Biſhops, not hinderers of that
which is their owne proper duty to performe. But verily
had Card. Bellar. lived in theſe countryes he would not have

ſaid that at this day there be many Preachers of Gods word
among religious Orders, but rather many beggars &amp; feeders
of their owne bellies, among religious Orders, who in begging
from houſe to houſe can publiſh the benefit of the cord,
the Roſary, the habit, &amp; the Scapulare, &amp; tell you a long ſtory
of the myracles of S. Francis, &amp; can frame many a tale, and
many a lewd lye of the pariſh Prieſt, to bring the people out
of love with their Paſtour, whereby the water may run
more freely unto their owne mills. But the healthfull doctrine,
the bleſſed life, the ſweet example, the ſtupendious
myracles of our Saviour &amp; Redeemer of the world, in the
Goſpell are little taught, or inſiſted upon, witneſſe thoſe
places &amp; parts of the country which the Fryars doe chiefly
haunt. Examine the people, &amp; the penitents of thoſe Friars,
in the miſtery of the Trinity, the incarnation of our Saviour,
the articles of their creed, the uſe of the Sacraments: you
ſhall finde them ſo defective, as they ſcarce deſerve the
name of Catechumen
                        •
                     . Not one of ten of them knowing
wherefore they were baptiſed, what they adore in the Euchariſt,
or wherfore they goe to Confeſſion. Nay if you demaund
which are the perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, they
will be more ready to tell you our bleſſed Lady, S. Patricke,
and S. Bride, then either Father, Sonne, or Holy Ghoſt, more
ignorant then thoſe of whom S. Paul ſpeaketh Act. 19. who
being aſked whether they had received the Holy Ghoſt, anſwered:
Sed ne
                        •
                      ſi spiritus ſanctus eſt audivimus. Nay wee
have not yet heard whether there bee a Holy Ghoſt, or no.
And wherefore is all this? but that the doctrine neceſſary
unto ſalvation, is not ſo neceſſary for the Friars maintenance;
For whether is it more eaſie to ſay with S. Paul, Operamini
ſalutem veſtram cum timore &amp; tremore, Epheſ. 6. Worke out

which walke in darkeneſſe: witneſſe thoſe Amulets, prayers,
and verſes hanging about the neckes of the poore deluded
people, men, women &amp; children, in which more truſt &amp; confidence
is repoſed, then may ſtand with the purity &amp; integrity
of our faith. But if theſe good people thus taught
ſhould againe feed with the like food of their bodies thoſe
their teachers, &amp; in place of wholeſome meat, ſhould ſet before
themſome ſtinking carrion; in place of butter &amp; cheeſe,
ſhould give them a lumpe of Tallow, and for good bread, of
Wheat, Rye, Oates, &amp;c. ſhould preſent them with a loafe

would ſet his marke upon them, if not his curſe: and the fayry

                        •
                     .
               
               I may remember ſince in England before the comming
in of the Regulars, all ſpirituall offices were performed unto
the Catholickes, by the Prieſts of the Clergy, of which
times it might be ſaid, in reſpect of the great concord and
unity which they enjoyed, as well the Prieſts among themſelves,
as with the Laity. That terra erat unius labij. The
earth it was of one lippe &amp; language, and as it is ſaid in the
4. Act. of thoſe primitive times of the Church: Multitudinis
credentium erat corunum, &amp; anima una, the multitude of
beleevers were all of one minde, &amp; of one will. But no ſooner
came the Ignatians (for they were the firſt) and the
Monkes, &amp; the Friars after them, &amp; did grow to any numbers
&amp; ſtrength, but then came in the confuſion of Babell, &amp;
their tongues were ſo devided, as one ſpoke nothing but of
Apollo, &amp; another of Cephas, (not I confeſſe in diverſity of
doctrines) but in variety of affections: where the Ignatian
was in requeſt, the Prieſt was neglected; where the Monke
ruled the roaſt, there the Ignatian was diſreſpected; where
the Friar could prevaile, there neither one nor other was
regarded. Till at length rather upon a ſudden ſhuf
                     •
                  ling up,

then compoſing any ſtable peace, they joyned all in one
with united forces to oppoſe the Eccleſiaſticall Clergy, and
what tumults &amp; hurly-burlies have ever ſince bin on foot
among them, &amp; ſtill continues (I wis, non ad aedificationem,
ſed ad deſtructionem, not to edification, but to deſtruction)
the world can witneſſe.
               Now in this Kingdome of Ireland what I have not onely
ſeene, but felt, it remaines further to declare. For about ſome
18. yeeres agoe, you may well remember with me, that the
Monkes &amp; the Friars being then but weake, &amp; (as it were)
in the cradle, the good Catholicke people were ruled both
in the divine office of the Church, as alſo in direction of
their conſciences wholly by the Prieſts of the Clergy their
Paſtours. Then was there ſuch devotion &amp; piety in the ſervice
of God, ſuch frequenting the Sacraments, ſuch love among
neighbours, ſuch feare of offence and wrong doing,
as it might truly be ſaid of thoſe golden dayes:

                     Flumina tum lactis, t
                           •
                        m flumina nectaris ibant,
                     Flavaque de viridi ſtillabant illice mella.
                  
Then ſtreames of milke, then ſtreames of wine did flow,
Then on greene okes ſweet honey-combes did grow.
               Then the Friar made ſcruple to encroach in the ſmalleſt
matter upon the office of the Pariſh Prieſt, nay he was ſo
humble, ſo gentle, ſo recollected, &amp; ſo mortified, as truly you
would have taken him for a very gay creature; but this was
but in his infancy, &amp; during the time of his noneage; for by
too much petting &amp; cockering of him, &amp; that chiefly by the
Pariſh Prieſts themſelves in the beginning (not then foreſeeing
whom they did foſter &amp; harbour in their boſomes,
or what rods they were in preparing for their owne ribs)
the Friar growing dayly to further acquaintance with the
Citizens, &amp; gathering unto himſelf continually more numbers
of his fellowes, he began ſoon to goe upon his owne
legges, &amp; to perceive quod cornuta erat facies ejus, that his
face had two hornes, with which he began bravely to lay about
him, A Paſtour when he pleaſeth, a Regular when hee

pleaſeth, a voluntary when he liſt, a preſſed ſouldier when
he liſt, an aſſiſtant when he thinkes good, and a principall
when he will. So as now down muſt the Oke, &amp; up muſt the
Bryar, under whoſe protection the ſheep betaking himſelfe
for ſhelter and protection in every ſtorme, his fleece ſhall be
well pulled, &amp; his skin ſurely ſcratched for his paines, as we
dayly ſee, &amp; in part already have ſet downe. But the Preſſe
calls ſo faſt upon me, as I can hardly with equall paces keep
company with it, &amp; therefore muſt ſpare further to enlarge
my ſelf upon this argument. Onely I will conclude it with
the ſaying of that holy &amp; learned Prelat Peter Camus, Biſhop
of Bellay in his Petronilla: That it is an admirable thing to ſee,
that ſuch as governe the people, will not take charge of them, &amp;
ſuch as have charge of them, &amp; are anſwerablo for them, can not
have the government of them. So he. Which obſervation of
his agrees with what a principall Friar of his Order lately
ſaid in this Citty, &amp; that in the hearing of many, That for
their parts they ſcorned to bee Pariſh Prieſts or Paſtours.
According to the doctrine which Friar Thomas Strong, a
Franciſcan, layde downe in his Manuſcript intituled an Anſwer
unto the fraternall correction of Paulus Veridicus Harris,
in which he compares the Superiours of Regulars unto
Sheep-heards, and the Pariſh Prieſts unto Swine-heards, &amp;
conſequently the Laity to Pigs &amp; hogs. This writing of his
is this day in my cuſtody, under his own hand, which I am
ready to impart to any who make doubt of the truth thereof.
O S. Peter &amp; S. Paul! yea, O S. Francis! How baſe and
contemptible is that holy office of Pariſh Prieſts in thy Friars
eyes at this day, who now beare themſelves as the only
Maſters in Iſrael, and would be accounted the ſole pillars of
Gods Church. So much then for the firſt office of a Paſtour
in the diſpenſation of the Word and Sacraments, together
with ſome digreſſions (I confeſſe) in which how defective
our Ordinary hath beene, in part is declared.
               Let us now conſider of the ſecond, which is in chaſing
away the Wolfes which come to kill, &amp; to deſtroy; repreſented

unto him in his paſtorall ſtaffe, given him in his conſecration,
with words, declaring that thereby his office is to
governe &amp; to defend his flock from the jawes of all ravenous
beaſts, who ſeeke to prey upon the ſame. Now let us
conſider how well our Ordinary hath uſed this his baculum
paſtorale, this his ſheep-heards ſtaffe, or whether to any better
purpoſe then he hath done his Bible before given him.
And for proofe heereof (good Reader) thou art to underſtand,
that upon the 29. of April, being the feaſt of S. Peter
Martyr, and S. Catheri

                   of Sienna, in the yeare of our Lord
1631. a certaine Franciſcan Friar, by name Thomas Babe, did
in the Cookes-ſtreet of Dublin, in a publick audience, publiſh
this doctrine: That forſomuch as a certain Spaniſh
Nun (called Luiſſa) of the Order of S. Clara, had a Revelation:
That whoſoever ſhould faſt upon the next Saturday after
they heard of her death, ſhould never dye in mortall
ſin, or of any evill death; The aforeſaid Fr. Babe perſwaded
the people then preſent, to under-take ſo holy a pe
                     •
                  ance: upon
which, very many both in the citty &amp; countrey (as they
did believe his doctrine, ſo did they keep very carefully the
ſame Faſt; among which our Ordinary Th
                        •
                     . Flemming aliàs
Barnwell, to give example, did the like. Neither was that doctrine
only then, but ſundry other times alſo taught by that
falſe Apoſtle, in divers other places of this City &amp; Dioceſſe.
               Another Friar alſo of the diſcalced Carmelites, by name
Iohn Plonket, as well in publick aſſemblies, as alſo in private
conferences, hath endeavoured to perſwade the people this
damnable doctrin: That whoſoever ſhall take the Sc
                     •
                  pulare
of the Carmelites, &amp; weare it upon his body, ſaying ſuch
prayers as thereunto belongeth, they ſhould never dye out
of the eſtate of grace, &amp; the favor of God, but at the furtheſt,
the next Saturday after their deaths, they ſhould be admitted
into the Ioyes of Heaven. Theſe I doubt not to call helliſh
doctrines broached by theſe falſe teachers in theſe later
dayes to draw us from our ſalvation in Chriſt, &amp; from the
merites of his bitter death &amp; paſſion, deſtroying, 
                     •
                   utterly

ſubverting our holy faith, received from the mouth of our
Saviour &amp; his Apoſtles, &amp; continued in all ages from thoſe
times, till theſe our dayes, in the Catholicke Church. For remedy
whereof, in zeale of Gods honour, the preſervation of
our holy faith, &amp; to prevent the danger of ſoules ſo abuſed,
complaint was made unto the Ordinary, as our chiefe Paſtor
of this Dioceſſe of Dublin, for to ſee correction had thereof,

               To which Petition no anſwer was ever yet given, neither
doe we expect that any ever will be given, but rather we
feare that this canker hath alſo poſſeſſed the head. And the
rather for that we underſtand, that theſe errours doe more
&amp; more ſpread themſelves thorough the bowels of this
Kingdome: and by name that there is another Carmelite,

called Patrick Donavan, native of the County of Corke, who
perſevers to teach the aforeſaid errors and blaſphemyes among
the people, to the great ſcandall of all good Chriſtians,
And forſomuch as we can not find that any Friars do oppoſe
themſelves either by word or writing, to theſe aforeſaid
pernicious doctrines, but only the Prieſts of the Clergy,
Therfore it may well be inferred, that all the Regulars of
this Kingdome are infected with the ſame leproſie, &amp; therefore
in time (if it be not already paſt time) to be ſeparated
from the reſt of the body. The dayes were when Celeſtius,
(a man of this Country birth) brought in Pelagianiſme, and

                     •
                  clipſed with that foule cloud of hereſie, the glory of the
Church then in this Kingdome. After him againe aroſe another
falſe Prophet, and native of this Countrey, called
Iohannes Scotus, about the yeare of our Lord 850. who introduced
the Sacramentary herefie, both of them Monkes,
whoſe wicked doctrines (had the ſerpent beene cruſhed
in the egg) had never come to that growth or greatneſſe,
which afterwards they did. Where then (ſay you) was the
paſtorall ſtaffe of the Prelate? Mary (ſay I) where now it is,
farre from the backe of the Wolfe, but peradventure layde
upon the loynes of the Sheep, as at this day we ſee it under
this our Archbiſhop, in whoſe ten yeares government (for
ſo long hath he poſſeſſed the Miter) both errour in doctrine,
&amp; diſſolu
                     •
                  eneſſe of life, hath more prevailed in all eſtates, but
eſpecially among the Friars of his owne Order, then in the
dayes of many of his predeceſſours. O what Legends might
be made of the unhappy lives of his Friars in this kingdome
of Ireland, within the compaſſe of theſe ten yeares! If either
Chriſtianity, Charity, or Civility would allow there of. I will
onely in generall, which is lawfull, &amp; with Cardinall Bellarmine

called by God unto the eſtate of perfection, but enduced by
other motives, have repleniſhed Monaſteryes: And that of
Iſay. 9. is fulfilled: Thou haſt multiplyed the nation, but not
increaſed their joy. Hence ſo many and grievous ſcandals,
knowne unto all, which yeeld plentifull matter unto the
dove of bewayling the looſeneſſe, I will not ſay the corruption
of religious Orders. So the Cardinall. In which words
the Author ſeemeth unto me, not onely to inveigh againſt
the wicked, and ſcandalous lives of many in Religion, but
even againſt the relaxation and corruption of Religious orders
themſelves.
            
            
               CAP. V.
               Of the prophecy of S. Francis, fore-telling into how great
ſinnes of Avarice, Pride, and Contention with
the Cl
                     •
                  rgy, his Friars in time ſhould fall.
               
                  BVt why ſhould I omit that teſtimony which of
all other, ſhould have the greateſt force of Argument,
to convict our Friar Minors, of their
moderne ungraciouſneſſe, &amp; impiety? and if their
hearts were not too rocky to convert them unto their ancient
and primitive piety, ſimplicity, and humility; I meane
the prophecy of S. Francis himſelfe, the Founder of their
Order, as it is layde downe in the Chronicle of S. Francis,
Tom. 1. lib. 2. cap. 28. in theſe words.
               A time will come, when the religious of my Order, by the
malice of the Devill, ſhall leave the way of holy ſimplicity,
indifferently receiving all ſorts of money, and all ſuch legacies,
as by teſtament ſhall be bequeathed them; &amp; leaving ſolitary,
&amp; humble places, will buiid faire &amp; ſumptuous houſes

in Cities, &amp; townes, capable to entertaine Princes, &amp; Emperours:
then by favour they will procure priviledges of the
Popes, thorough art, &amp; humane prudence; and by thei
                     •
                   earneſt
importunity, they will obtaine requeſts meerely injuſt,
though cloked with truth; by this means they will not only
abandon their rule inſtituted by Ieſus Chriſt againſt their ſolemne
profeſſiō, but will alſo ruine, &amp; alter the purity therof,
changing the good intention into perverſe, and being armed
by meanes of the ſaid priviledge, againſt obedience, againſt
other Religious, and againſt all the Clergy, when they ſhall
expect to get the victory, the wretches ſhall find themſelves
falne into the trench which themſelves ſhall have made, gathering
no other fruite of their Seminary, but ſcandals;
which they ſhall offer to God in ſteed of the ſalvation of
ſoules, who ſeeing the ſame, ſhall be no more hence forward
their Paſtour, but their ruiner, according unto their merits.
And therefore he will leave them entangled in the nets of
Avarice, and their vaine deſires, &amp;c. So S. Francis in his aforeſaid
Chronicle, printed &amp; publiſhed by his own Friars.
               And who can make queſtion, but thoſe times foretold by
S. Francis, are now come, &amp; that his prophecy in all points
is fullfilled! And firſt for the praevarication of his Rule, in
receiving of all ſorts of money, we ſee it dayly practiſed by
his owne Friats, in taking of Gold &amp; Silver, &amp; that as freely
as any worldlings, alwayes provided, that they touch it not
with their bare hands: but alas! what pennance or mortification
is that? when as they may admit of it in a hander-kerchiefe,
a glove, or lapped in a browne paper? for being given
them in that manner, the Capuchin himſelfe (who profeſſeth
moſt ſtrictly to obſerve the Rule of S. Francis) will moſt
gently accept of it, &amp; place it in his pocket. But ſhall wee
thinke that S. Francis (ſo holy a man) had no deeper a conſideration,
in prohibiting his Friars ſo earneſtly, and with ſo
many words in that his ſhort Rule, neither to aſke, nor in
any wiſe to receive money offred them, but onely (forſooth)
that they ſhould not handle the ſame? But that you may the

better underſtand this their praevarication of the Rule, I will
ſet you downe his owne words, I ſay, in that very ſame rule,
which himſelfe avoucheth (both in his Teſtament above cited
cap. 1. as alſo in theſe his words above alledged out of
his Chronicle) to have beene inſtituted by him.

               That the Friars ſhall not receive money.
               I doe commaund firmely all the brethren, that by no
meanes they receive pence, or money, neither by themſelves
nor by another perſon; Yet for the neceſſity of the ſicke, and
for the cloathing of the Friars, by their ſpirituall friends,
onely the Superiours, and Guardians, ſhall have great care of
them, according to places, and times, and cold Regions, as
they ſhall ſee it to be neceſſary. This alwayes remembred,
that (as it is ſaid) they receive no pence or money.
               And this is one of thoſe 7. formall precepts, which they
all confeſſe to binde under mortall ſinne, ſtrictly commaunding
them as you ſee, neither by themſelves, nor by any other
perſon, to receive any moneyes: Which precept now for a
long time, by their common practiſe, is thus commodiouſly
gloſſed, that onely they may not touch Moneyes with their
naked fingers. But may it not with good reaſon be verified
of theſe our gray Friars, that which our Saviour ſaid of the

written,) was commaunded by Ieſus Chriſt, and vowed by
his Friars, &amp; yet in the ſight of all mens eyes violated. Nay,

that our Mendicant Friars may make it knowne unto the
world, that they are veri philargiri, true lovers of money,
they every yeare ſell and turne into coyne, many flockes of
Sheepe, Hoggs, Geeſe, Turkies, Hens, Cheeſe, Egges; which
thorough their ſhameleſſe importunity, they have rather extorted,
then begged, from the honeſt Farmer, charged with a
great family, &amp; a high rent, yea frō many a poore man &amp; woman,
who might hardly have ſpared it from their own hungry
bellies. Theſe things are not obſcure or darke, or done
in a corner, but in the face of the world, &amp; in the eyes of this
ſun, &amp; which this poore Kingdome, can feelingly witneſſe
with me. And verily it ſeemes the Friars mendicant were
very little better conditioned in the dayes of King Henry

to thoſe, but generally to the ſins of all the Inhabitants of
the earth, including the Orders of the Begging Friars, to heap
up the cauſes of theſe miſchiefes, who (unmindfull of their
profeſſion) have forgot to what end their Orders were inſtituted,
becauſe their legiſlatours &amp; inſtituters (moſt holy men)
would therefore have them poore, &amp; altogether free from the
poſſeſſions of temporall things, that for ſpeaking of the truth,
they might not have any thing, which they might feare to
looſe. But now while they envy ſuch as have poſſeſſions, approving
the faults of great men, nouriſhing the common people

who have renounced poſſeſſions, in hoarding up of

cap. 33. writeth, that the aforeſaid Ricardus Armachanus, before
Pope Innocentius 6, &amp; his Cardinals at Auignion, did
ſpue out many things againſt the ſtate of the begging Friars, &amp;
not long after, dyed. Yet is it manifeſt by that very ſame Oration,
which then he made, that he ſpake not at all againſt the
inſtitute of any religious order, but only that he inveighed againſt
their manifold relaxations, corruptions, &amp; abuſes; neither
did he dye ſoone after, for he lived three whole yeares after
he uttered the ſame, &amp; left behind him a greater fame both
of learning &amp; ſanctity, then either Platus or Aquaviva, or any
other of his adverſaryes hitherto have done. Armachanus
made that Oration by Trithemius teſtimony de ſcriptoribus eccleſiaſticis

the Papall Court of Avignion 1360. 17. Calend. Decemb. So
Henricus Marleſburgenſis in Chronico, to which the Iriſh Annals
do agree. And ſo much of this Author &amp; his teſtimony, as
touching the Avarice of the Mendicant Orders in his time.
               But alas, why ſhould I looke behind me unto the times of
yore, will not theſe our dayes, &amp; this poore countrey yeeld us
palpable examples of the Covetouſnes of Friars, not to ſpeak
of their other vices? Somthing I have ſpoken before of their
two ploughes of Begging Cap. 1. the one by retayle, the other
by groſſe. Now I wil ſpeak a word or two of other 2 ploughs
of theirs, no leſſe working then the former. The firſt, of their
Novices which they receive into their Order. The ſecond of
their cord, habit, &amp;c.
               And firſt for the men Novices. It is well knowne that the
Friar will admit of none among them, but ſuch as either bring
them in good portions, or elſe ſuch as they gueſſe will prove

                     〈◊〉
                   out Beggars, to recompence in their induſtry what they are

wanting in meanes. So as what patrimony a father would
leave his ſon, either upon his preferment, or at his death, that
the Friar will have, he will not abate a ſmulkin. If the Father
ſtumble at it, he ſhall be terryfied with matter of conſcience,
as, Is not God Almighty worthy to have as much as the
world? &amp;c. or elſe with the authority of the Biſhop of the
Dioceſſe, eſpecially if that Biſhop be a Friar. And doe the Father
what he can, he ſhall both part with his Son, &amp; his mony.
               As for their vowed Nunnes, they bring with them 700. or
500. &amp; at the loweſt rate 300. or 200. &amp; 50. pounds ſterling, &amp;
yet if they live in ſuch pennance, &amp; auſterity, as the Friars perſwade
us, ſurely they cannot ſpend by the powle, omnibus vijs,
&amp; modis, 10. pounds per annum. And yet notwithſtanding all
theſe marriage goods, (for ſo they call them) thoſe virgins
have their agents, who begge in the country for them, to bring
them in almes, for it is a rule with our Nunnes, as well as with
the Friars. Want, or want not, begge they muſt, beſides what
gifts the friends of thoſe ſo rich maides, &amp; ſo well deſcended,
doe dayly preſent them withall. Now if a maide who is poore
&amp; hath no portion, or meanes at all, ſhould offer her ſelfe unto
their Nunneryes, were ſhe as devout as Anna the daughter of
Phanuel, of whom it is ſaid, that ſhe never departed from the
Temple ſerving God, night &amp; day in prayer &amp; faſting. Luke. 2.
&amp; were ſhe as chaſt as Suſanna, 
                  
                     ••
                  y had ſhe the Virginity of S.

                     Ʋrſula and all her eleven thouſand Virgins, yet ſhould ſhe be
put backe from the gate of the Monaſtery, as one of the 5. fooliſh
Virgins, with neſcio vos, I know you not.
               Another plough of our Mendicants, I will not ſay the laſt,
(for they better know then I, how many they have) is the cord
or the Scapulare, or the Girdle, or the Breads of S. Nicolas, or
the Rofary, as alſo the habite of their Orders, which brings no
ſmall profit unto them. For by ſuch indulgences, graces and
pardons, annexed unto them, there is procured unto the Mendicants,
infinite calmes and perpetuall Benefactours. For the
people generally, whether thorough their ignorance, or miſteaching,
I know not, ſeeme much more at this day to ſtand in
feare of Purgatory, then of hell it ſelfe. And they are perſwaded

that theſe things, together with their almes unto the Friar,
will ſave them from the flames of Purgatory. So as who among
them now is ſo hard hearted, as in his life time is not
girt with a Cord? or 
                     〈◊〉
                   their deathes is not buried in a Friars
habit? which habit if of your ſelfe you ſhall have no devotion
to deſire, the Friar will take occaſion to viſite you in your
ſickeneſſe, &amp; although it be but 5. minutes before you deceaſe,
he will offer you to be buried in his habit; If you thanke him
it is enough, it is taken for acceptation, albeit you ſay neither
yea, nor no. On goes the habit ſo ſoone as the life hath left
you, &amp; ſo you are expoſed till buriall, that all your neighbours
may behold you. The great devotion of the party unto the order
whoſe habite he tooke, is much advanced, his ſalvation is
no whit doubted of, &amp;c. Now you muſt conceive by all meanes
that this habit is given you gratis, that is, of free coſt, for elſe
it were Simony, but yet I truſt the friends of the party are not
ſo unmannerly, but by all recknings be ended, they might as
cheape have bought a piece of frize of an hundred yards. You
know what Martiall ſaith, Pauperum dona hami ſunt, Cum
dant, tum maxime petunt. Poore mens gifts are hookes, when
they give, then moſt of all they crave, &amp; who poorer then the
Friar, though little pinched with want. For they know well
to diſtinguiſh, inter pauper tatem &amp; indigentiam, twixt poverty
&amp; want, the firſt indeed they profeſſe, but the ſecond is without
the compaſſe of their vowes, they leave that for the Clergy.
And therefore Iohannes Ruſbrochius himſelfe a Monke,
ſpeaking of the Friar Mendicants of theſe times, in his booke
called Tabernaculum foederis, cap. 123. hath theſe words, Mendici,
&amp; pauperes dici volunt, &amp; ſuam ſemper queri inopiā, &amp; tamen
omnibus abundare rebus. Beggars &amp; poore they deſire to be called,
&amp; alwayes to complaine of their want; and yet to abound
with all things. And me thinkes a Friar when he is on horſebacke,
with his hatched Rapier, and his wrought Spurres, and
meetes a pariſh Prieſt upon the way, in his fri
                     ••
                  , Stockins, and
his brogges going on foote (happily twice as farre as the other
is to ride,) &amp; that to miniſter unto ſome poore ſicke Creature
in a Cot, he ſhould be much aſhamed of himſelfe, eſpecially

when he calls to minde that precept of S. Francis in the 3. cap.
of his rule. Non debeant equitare, nisi manifeſta neoeſſitate, vel
infirmitate cogantur. The Friars are not to ride, but compelled
thereunto thorough manifeſt neceſſity, or ſickneſſe. So he, But
verily in theſe parts it ſhall be much againſt the Friars humour
to travell two miles out of Towne, not mounted upon an eaſie
paſed horſe: Nay it ſeemes that the Friars who live among us,
are of opinion, that the world would be ſcandalized to ſee
them goe on foot. Well then let us leave the Friar on horſebacke,
and returne we a little backe to our purpoſe of the habit,
from which we have made this ſhort digreſſion.
               Were then our Friars really ſo charitable, &amp; ſo liberall in beſtowing
of their habits. And did they ſo much thirſt after the
good of ſoules, yea and ſo tender hearted as they could not endure
that a ſoule ſhould remaine ſome ſhort time in Purgatory,
but rather they would beſtow upon the corps the habit of
S. Francis, or S. Dominicke, for their rellefe. I then wonder (as
Armachanus did well obſerve,) why they doe onely addreſſe
themſelves unto the rich &amp; to the great ones, and not unto the
poore, for ſurely our chriſtian faith teacheth us that the poore
have ſoules as well as the rich. And who can otherwiſe judge,
but that it is as meritorious a deed to cover a poore corpes
with a habit, who many times hath ſcarce a rag of a courſe
ſheet to ſhroude them in, as to beſtow it upon the carcaſe of
never ſo rich a man, for here is a ſoule, &amp; ſo is there: there is neceſſity,
&amp; the ſubject of an almes, &amp; heere is none. But as Armachanus
anſwers well for them, in his booke called Defenſoriorum
curatorum. Non more Thobiae ad ſepelcendum rupiunt corpora
pauperum defunctorum, ſed inſtar vulturun
                        •

                     unt.
Not as Thobias did, doe they ſeeke for the bodies of the poore
deceaſed, to bury them: but like unto vultures, ſmelling out
their carions beyond ſeas five hundred miles doe they ſeeke
food. So he.
               Neither are theſe Mendicants comented with ſuch profit, as
they make of their habits, and ſepultures from the Larty, but
they muſt encroach alſo upon the Paſtours; or pariſh Prieſt of

the place, clayming not onely the honour of the funerall rites,
&amp; ceremonies, to be performed by themſelves, but challenging
all dutyes, offerings, and almes thereunto belonging. And here
I may not forget what a late preſident of the Parliament of
Aix in France, hath left written of the ambition of our Friars
Minors in ſuch occaſions. I will give you his words.
               Fratres S. Franciſci qui ſe appellant Minores; ut nomen conſonet
rei, debent eſſe minori loco, ideò tanquam humiliores, quia minores
non debent praetendere cōtra aliquos de aliqua praecedētia, &amp;c.
               The Friars of S. Francis Order, who call themſelves Minors,
as much as to ſay, the leſſer; that their name may be agreeable
unto the thing, they ought to be in a lower place, as more
hūble, for that the leſſer ought never to pretend for precedency
of place againſt any. Becauſe in doing otherwiſe they ſhould
ſeem to go againſt their own Order, &amp; eſtate, which is to be the
leſſer of all eſtates &amp; Orders of the whole Vniverſall Church;
nay, which is more, ſince a certain time, they would have the
name of minimi, that is, the loweſt of all other, by vertue of a
certain reformation. But I ſee that all this is but in word, not
in deed. For that they will not only contend for equality with
other Religious, but alſo with the Cathedrall Church: As I
have ſeene in the Funerals of a certaine Noble &amp; potent man,
Francis Rollin: who for one onely houre was depoſitated in
their Church; &amp; in carrying of the Corps, they would not only
be in the laſt place before the Canons of the Cathedrall
Church; but their Guardian ſaid, That he ought to have the
laſt place, yea after the Biſhop himſelf then in place. Which
how ridiculous it was, &amp; ought to be, let all imagin. By which
it may be ſeen what may be ſaid of them, who when as they
ought in all humility to ſtrive with the loweſt, yet will they
contend for equality with the higheſt. Wherefore their pride
can not more rightly be compared to any thing, then to the
pride of Lucifer, who would be like unto the moſt High. Bartholomaeus
Chaſſanaeus Praeſes Senatus Aquaeſextias in Catalogo
Gloriae mundi parte 4. Conſideratione 69.
               Thus (gentle Reader) I have given theea touch of thoſe dangerous
doctrines taught by our Friars, tending to the evacuation

of that great benefit of our ſalvation in Chriſt. I have
ſhewed how farre our Archbiſhop, with all the reſt of his Friars
are intereſſed therein. Moreover, both out of grave Authors,
&amp; lamentable experience of theſe times, I have diſcourſed
of thoſe manifold and manifeſt enormityes of the Friar
Mendicants, &amp; more particularly of this Country: Their Avarice,
Lying, Ambition, &amp; Hypocriſie. Neither have publiſhed
the ſecret faults of any. God forbid I ſhould. It is not only againſt
Chriſtian charity, but humanity, ſo to do. If any ſay, It is
not my part to handle theſe matters, &amp; it concernes me not? I
anſwer, I am one of thoſe whom the Scripture calls barking
dogs, I ſay 56. And whoſe office it is not only to barke at the
wolfe when I ſee him a farre off, but if he come nearer me, to
bite him too. Math. 7. And by Gods grace ſo will I do, ſo long
as I have either tongue or teeth in my head. And ſo had I ended,

               CAP. VI.
               A defence of our late Appeale.
               
                  THat I was requeſted by a friend, to lay downe
the grounds &amp; motiues which enduced M. D.
Cadell &amp; my ſelfe to publiſh in Print our late
Appeale unto the See Apoſtolicke, from the
gravamina or agrievances of the Archbiſhop,
&amp; the rather, for that the Friars, &amp; thoſe of his
faction (as it is ſaid) take great exceptions thereunto.
               1. Firſt then in defence of the aforeſaid printed Appeale; I
anſwere, That there is nothing therein publiſhed unto the
world, which was not publicke before, either de Iure, or de
facto, or both, as by induction ſhall appeare when time ſerves.
Now to make a thing more publick, which is already publick,
was alwayes held moſt lawfull. In confirmation whereof
ſee theſe Authors following. Cajet. opuſcuio 31. Reſponſ. 9. Leſſius

Writers. If then to make more publick what already is publick,
be lawfull: it skils not whether that publication be written
or printed, writing or printing being but accidentall to
publication.
               If you ſay; But thoſe foule exceſſes laide unto the charge of
the Archbiſhop, ought at leaſt to have bin concealed from the
Proteſtants. I anſwer, (as in part I have done before in my Epiſtle
unto the Reader) That as among us a mixt people, the
manifeſt faults &amp; exceſſes of Proteſtants, cannot be concealed
from the Catholicks: No more is it poſſible, that the manifeſt
faults &amp; exceſſes of our Catholicks can any wiſe be hidden
from the Proteſtants, of which nature &amp; quality are thoſe 8.
aggrievances, which we layde down in our late Appeale.
               Beſides, who ſeeth not, that it is the delinquents thēſelves,
who firſt manifeſt &amp; make publick their own diſorders, &amp; by
ſuch manifeſtation they come to be known of others, who in
their own juſt defence may make uſe therof, by way of juſtice,
to haue the ſame reformed or corrected: how els could it be
lawfull to bring any perſon in queſtion, upon crimes in courts
&amp; Tribunals? And how comes it to paſſe, that we have both
heard 8
                     •
                   read of Prelats, not only excommunicated, or ſuſpended,
but ſomtimes depoſed for Hereſie, Schiſme, Simony, &amp;c.
I ſay, If their own faults might not be further publiſhed.
               2. Secondly in defence of Printing our Appeale, I ſay, that
an Appeale is a juridicall inſtrument, of his owne nature, admitting
publicity no leſſe then all other court pleadings, as
Bills, Anſwers, Orders, Sentences, Iudgements, Executions, &amp;
the like: All which proceſſes of publicke courts, may be notified
through the world, either by pen, or Preſſe.
               3. Thirdly we committed that our Appeale, the rather unto
the Preſſe, for that we ſuſpected our Ordinary would not accept
it at our hands, having often before denyed to receive any
letter, or Petition, from ſuch ſuiters as deſired juſtice of him, &amp;
ſo de facto, it came to paſſe. For firſt perſonally, &amp; in pen hand,
we preſented this ſelfe ſame Appeale unto our Ordinary, Iune
21. an. 1632. who refuſed to receive it of us. Wherefore that it

might be ſufficiently knowne that we did. Appeale from his
manifold tyrannies, to a higher Tribunall, which benefit of the
canon, for that he both hath &amp; doth continually ſeeke to deprive
us of, and debarre us of all audience, we held it neceſſary
(and as by our learned councell we were adviſed) to notifie
his manifold and manifeſt injuſtice: omnibus Chri. fidelibus.
               
               4. Fourthly, None can Appeale from the court of the Ordinary
to a higher Tribunall, but of neceſſity he muſt lay downe
the cauſes &amp; grounds, why he declines the judgement of his
Ordinary, otherwiſe his Appeale is not onely voyde in law,
but he is puniſhable for the ſame. See 2. q. 6. cap. Quicun
                        •
                     , &amp;
cap. emaino, de appellationibus in 6. &amp; ibi, gloſſam. Item Sayrus de
eenſ. lib. 12. cap. 17. num. 34. with many Doctours by him cited:
So then thoſe 8. Gravamina layd downe in our Appeale, being
the cauſes why we declined his juriſdiction, wee could not
omit the ſame.
               5. Our fift reaſon is Ad hominem, as thus: Our Ordinary Thomas
Flemming, aliàs Barnewell, thinking good to prohibit the
people our Maſſes, under Excommunication, he layes downe
for his ground, our diſobedience &amp; continuall inſolency, without
hope of amendment, &amp;c. as may appeare by the firſt lines
of his cenſure prefixed unto this work (which cauſes althogh
above at large are proved to be meerly his owne inventions)
yet true or falſe, he made no ſcruple to publiſh them in open
Auditories &amp; aſſemblies, when the greateſt concourſe of people
might be had, to our great diſgrace, ſhame, and infamy (as
much as in him was.) If this (I ſay) was lawfull for him to do
againſt us in matters ſo falſe (as we dayly challenge him to the
proofe of them) may not we doe the like in our juſt defence,
in his moſt notorious crimes, to which every day we offer our
ſelves to the tryall and touchſtone of proofe, before any Tribunall
which is pleaſed to take knowledge thereof?
               6. Laſtly, our Archbiſhops faction dayly writes, and prints
againſt us of the Clergy, witneſſe that infamous Libell, called
Examen juridicum cenſurae Pariſienſis, under the ſaigned name
of Edmundus Ʋrſulanus, not onely ſcoſfing the R. Biſhops of
France, with all the moſt learned Doctours of Sorbon, &amp; that

famous Vniverſity of Paris, in moſt baſe &amp; contumelious language
traducing them: but alſo charging five R. Prieſts of this
Iriſh Nation (&amp; that by name) with lewd aſperſions, of which
himſelfe dare neither give his name (by which he may be
knowne) nor ſhew his head to the juſtification. Nay, not ſparing
to blemiſh the fame of the moſt Ill: Archbiſhop of Paris,
being himſelfe (as is confeſſed by his owne faction) a Friar
Minor, (but more they neither will, nor dare give us of him,)
which libelling Pamphlet of that Friar, is in ſuch high eſtimation
with our Archbiſhop, as it is made his only Vade mecum:
may not we then in defence of our good names, print what
we are daily provided to juſtifie, firming it with our own proper
names, by which every houre we may be knowne &amp; challenged,
as we did that our aforeſaid Appeale, to ſo many perſons
as we did communicate the ſame unto? And as I my ſelf
the Author of this Book Paul Harris, do ſubſcribe my name
with mine own hand, offering my ſelfe to the juſtification of
every word &amp; ſyllable therein contained.
               The next worke (gentle, judicious, &amp; impartiall Reader)
which thou mayeſt expect at my hands, is a full refutation of
thoſe moſt impious &amp; blaſphemous doctrines of the Friars,
above-mentioned in Cap. 4. As alſo a compendions Treatiſe of
the 6. Excommunications, 2. Exiles, 2. Suſpenſions, publiſhed
&amp; inflicted within the compaſſe of a few weekes by our preſent
Archbiſhop, Tho, Flemming, aliàs Barnwell, with the cauſes,
motives, &amp; ſubjects of them all. And ſo ſubmitting my ſelf
&amp; all my writings, to the cenſures of the See Apoſtolick, beſeeching
Almighty God of his infinit goodnes and mercy, to
grant us his grace, ro live and dye his ſervants. I heere end.
