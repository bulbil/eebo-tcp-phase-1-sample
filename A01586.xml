            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            A
DISCOVRSE MATHEMATICALL
on the variation of the
Magneticall Needle.
            
               TO write an Encomiaſtique of the Magnet
is not my intention; the bold &amp;
confident attempts of Seamen, thorough
thoſe hidden paths of the vaſt
Ocean, to all navigable parts of the
earth, will ſpare me the labour; neither
will theſe few lines permit me to ſpeake of all
Magneticall qualities, they that liſt may have recourſe
for their ſatisfaction herein, to that moſt learned worke
(admired by all Foreiners) long agoe penned by Mr.
Dr. Gilbert our countryman, ſometimes Phyſitian to
that Renowned Lady our late Queene. That which I
here principally ayme at, is the deflection of the Needle
from the Terreſtriall Meridian, together with that abſtruſe
and admirable variation of the Variation, lately
diſcovered to the world.
            The Variation then is the deflection of the Magneticall
Meridian from the Terreſtriall, the Horizon determining
its Quantitie and Qualitie. Theſe Meridians
ſometimes are coincident, and in ſuch places there
can be no Variation▪ Sometimes againe they are different,

and then that Hemiſpere wherein either extremity
of the Needle lyes, denominates its Quality, for if it
be the Eaſterne Hemiſpere, it is called Eaſterly variation,
if the weſterne, weſterly. And the Horizon ſuppoſed
(as all great Circles are) to be divided into 360 parts, &amp;
each part ſubdivided into Centeſmes or Milleſmes, defines
the Quantity as 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. parts of variation.
            For our more diſtinct proceeding (and to give ſome
ſatisfaction to thoſe that are not altogether Mathematicall)
it will not be impertinent to our preſent purpoſe
to give ſome probable Reaſon for this variation or
ſwarving of the Needle from the meridians of moſt
places.
            Take a vigorous Magnet, convert it into a Sphericall
Body, and having found its Poles, delineat the ſame
with Meridians, the Aequinoctiall, and Parallells.
            
            Then take a fine ſowing Needle, and applying it to the interſection
of a Meridian and the Aequinoctiall, it will
be found preciſely to point out the Poles of the ſtone;
and if the Needle be moved towards either Pole, according
to its owne direction, it will trace out a Circle over
the ſaid Magnetique Pole. But if this Sphaericall Magnet
ſhall have a part of it excavated, as admitt about the
forty fift Paralell, and forty fift Meridian or degree of
longitude, the Needle moued forwards from the foreſaid
interſection, aſſoone as it ſhall draw neere to the
limb of this excavation, will forthwith leave its former
poſition, as lying in the plane of the prime meridian, and
incline to the other ſolide ſide, not reſpecting at all the
aforeſaid Poles: and this deflection we call the variation
of the Needle: And the greater will this variation
be, the neerer it approacheth to the Poles. For

whereas before the excavation each ſide being a like
potent,Which may be ſome cauſe of thoſe ſuddaine and exorbitant variations in the Nortweſt and other Northerne &amp; Southerne parts of the Earth. the Needle like an upright and indifferent
Arbiter inclined to neither part; after the excavation
it will convert it ſelfe to the more ſolide ſide,
rejecting the imperfect and defective, and ſo much
the more powerfully, by how much the other ſide
ſhall be found to have loſt more of its Magnetique
vigorous ſubſtance.
            The like will fall out if the Needle be ſo placed, as
that it ſhall biſect the excavated part, for then will it
acurately point out the true Poles of the ſtone formerly
found, but ſuddainely ſwarue from them after any
little diſlocation, ſtrongly applying it ſelfe to the
more ſolide ſide.
            As it is with this little, ſo likewiſe with the greater
Magnet the Earth, whoſe ſolide magnetique parts are
great Continents, the defective and excavated, the
deepe and vaſt channell of the Sea. For if there were
obſervations made in the midd way betweene the Eaſterly
Coaſt of China and this weſterne of Europe, it is
very probable there would be found no variation at all,
the Terreſtriall and Magneticall Meridians being congruall;
but if we ſhall incline to either ſide, as admit to
the weſtward, the Needle will in like manner move it
ſelfe to the Eaſterne Continent, as the more prevalent
ſide, the channell of the Sea being a part deficient of
the Sphericall Body of the Earth, and the Needle
finding no incouragement to apply it ſelfe there
to.
            And ſo likewiſe for the Ocean, which palliates the
imperfect parts of the Earth, it is evident, that if the

               Needle ſhall equally divide the Marine diſtance between
two continents, there will be found no variation, as
having both the Meridians united, the Needle equally
diſpoſing itſelfe to either Continent. But if we ſhall
ſwerue from this mediety, it will preponderate with
the next continent.
            For the evidence of the truth hereof, let a man examaine
generally the variations of our moſt expert Seamen,
(a Catalogue wherof we have annexed to that accurate
worke of Mr. Wright in his detection and conection
of errors in Navigation) (although by reaſon
of the diverſities of the ſetts of their Compaſſes and
oftentimes unapt handling of their inſtruments, they
very ſeldome concurre) obſerued in the Atlantique Ocean,
from the Equator unto the parts of Norway, all
along the Eaſt Coaſt from the Meridian of the Azores,
as farre North as hath beene diſcovered, and he ſhall
finde the ordinary practiſe to teſtifie the truth hereof.
As alſo after the ſame manner from the Equator ſouthward,
unto the ſtreights of Magellan, and all along the
backe parts of America in the South Sea, and on the
Eaſt Coaſt unto the Cape of Bona Speranza, and he
ſhall perceive the like agreement; But in fayling from
the aforeſaid Cape further Eaſtward, that ſometime
they doe finde it otherwiſe, the cauſe proceedeth from
the different ſituation of the South Continent hitherto
undiſcovered. And whereas in the Atlantique Ocean
about 135 leagues from the Ilands of Corues and Flores
to the weſtward,Mr. Iohn Wells. there hath beene found by an able Artiſt
no variation at all, it is a manifeſt argument, that the
Place is equidiſtant from the Europaean or Affrican continents
and the American: And as we approach to either

Continent, ſo ſhall we find the Needle praepotent in
its converſion; from whence the variation ſhall receive
its denomination.
            Therefore its abſurd for Seamen to touch their
Compaſſes with the allowance of the variation of any
particular place, conſidering this variation is perpetually
variable according to the ſhipps motion.
            And moreover its abſolutely neceſſary for that Seaman
who ſailes by his Compaſſe, continually to ſearch
the variatiō, that ſo by the Proſthaphaereticall application
thereof, the true point of the compaſſe (which is his
principall Mercurialiſt) may be rectified.
            And this artifice may be performed by the aſſiſtance
of the Planets or fixed Starres, and that either without
or with their Altitudes. I ſhall not need to exemplify
all varieties, as having elſwhere copiouſly and demonſtratively
delivered the ſame. I thinke it only convenient
to touch lightly at one or two, and ſuch as beſt
conduce to our preſent purpoſe.
            And firſt without an Altitude. Finde two fixed
Starres of equall right Aſcention, and holding vp a
thread and plummet, obſerve when the thread biſects
them (for that is the exact Meridian of the place) and
at that inſtant apply the Compaſſe to them; if the
Needle preciſely reſpect them, there is no variation;
if not, then is the difference, the variation inquired;
and that part of the Horizon to which it inclines,
(alwayes accounting from the ſame interſection of the
Horizon and Meridian) claimes it.
            It may likewiſe be performed by the Amplitude Ortive
or Occiduall of the Sunne, and as well by night as
by day, by the reſt of the Planets or fixed Starres, having

onely their declinations and the Latitude of the
places, either Geometrically by an Analemme, or
Arithmetically by the helpe of the Canon of Triangles,
for the ordinary termes of the proportion runne
thus.
            As the Sine complement of the Latitude, is to the
Radius, So the Sine of the declination, to the Sine of the
Amplitude. Turning therefore the Compaſſe to the
Sunne or Starres, the difference of the Arcs is the variation
inquired. Or by knowing the time of the Sunnes
incidence into the Plane of the Prime verticall, after
the like manner we may obtaine our deſires.
            But in theſe and ſome other wayes, we are confined
to a certaine time: If therefore to the former requiſits
we ſhall add an Altitude, this Artifice may be performed
at any convenient appearance of a Planet or Starre,
as we ſhall by and by ſhew.
            And for the more eaſie and certayne obtaining of the
variation at Sea, I would adviſe the Sea-man to extend
or prolong the capitall of his Needle, or fix ſome ſtile
on it, ſo that it may cut the Flye at right Angles, for
then the Compaſſe coverted to the Sun, this ſtile will
readily ſhadow out the Azimuth Magneticall, and comparing
it with that of the Sunne, he hath the variation
neere enough without any further labour or preparation.
            Thus hitherto (according to the Tenents of all our
Magneticall Philoſophers) we have ſuppoſed the variations
of all particular places to continue one and the
ſame: So that when a Seaman ſhall happly returne to
a place where formerly he found the ſame variation,
he may hence conclude, he is in the ſame former Longitude.
               
For it is the Aſſertion of Mr. Dr. Gilberts. Variatio

place doth alwayes retaine the ſame variation. Neither
hath this Aſſertion (for ought I ever heard) been
queſtioned by any man. But moſt diligent magneticall
obſervations have plainely offred violence to the ſame,
and proved the contrary, namely that the variation is
accompanied with a variation. For whereas in the
yeare 1580 Mr. Burrows (a man of unqueſtionable abilities
in the Mathematiques) found the variation at Limhouſe
neere London to be 11 gr. 15 min. or neere one
point of the Compaſſe; In the yeare 1622 Mr. Gunter
ſometimes profeſſor of Astronomie in Greſham Colledge,
found the variation in the ſame place to be but 6 gr. 13
min. And my ſelfe this preſent yeare 1634 with ſome
friends had recourſe to Dedpford (where Mr. Gunter
had heretofore made the ſame obſervations with thoſe
at Limehouſe) and found it not much to exceed 4 degrees.
            For the clearer manifeſtation of this truth, (becauſe
all men have not beene furniſhed with or ſeene the fore
ſaid obſervations, I hold it neceſſary to transferre
theirs hither, and ſubnect thoſe which were lately

            The way of finding the variation after this manner
is eaſy to be conceived. A time being choſen when the
Heavens were like to be unmasked for the whole day,
the altitudes of the Sunne were taken by him to each
degree of a Quadrant both forenoone &amp; Afternoone,
from 17 to 25 gr. making nine ſeverall obſervations.
And at every Altitude turning his Needle to the Sunn,
obſerved the degree and parts cut thereby. Then comparing
the Magneticall Azimuthes made in the Forenoone,
with thoſe in the Afternoone anſwerable to
the ſame Solar altitudes, the halfe of the difference is
the variation. Thus at the altitude of 17 gr. in the

Forenoone, the Needle cutting 52 gr. 35 min. and at the
ſame altitude in the Afternoone 30 gr. 0 min: the difference
is 22 gr. 35 min: the halfe whereof is 11 gr. 17
min: 30 Sec. the variation inquired.
            Before we proceed to other Obſervations it will be
requiſite we take a review of theſe, and after correction
of ſome of the apparent Altitudes, call the Solar
Azimuthes to the Iudicature of a Triangle.
            It is not unknowne that about this time of Mr. Burrowes
his obſervations the accurate and corrected tables
of the Sunnes motion were not publiſhed to the
world, Neither the Angles of the Obliquity and Paralaxes
of the Sunne ſo truely determined. And as for
the refraction (which inſinuates it ſelfe in every Altitude
not exceeding 45 degrees) being then in its infancy
and a ſtranger to the world it was not called into
the account, no not by the Ancients themſelues, nor
limited before that great Aſtronomer and honorable
Dane Tyche Brahe opened the ſame way. If therefore
we ſhall examine theſe Altitudes acording to the late
corrected grounds, we ſhall ſomewhat alter the variations
of Mr. Burrowes, but ſo as that we ſhall not much
differ from him, or ſuſpect any great error in his
worke.
            Theſe obſervations then of his, were made the 16
of October Anno 1580. And by Aſtronomicall Calculation
ſhould begin about 9 ½ in the Morning, and end about
2 ⅓ in the Afternoone. Let us now make choice of the
Magneticall Azimuthes anſwerable to the Altitudes of
20 gr. being the fourth obſervation. The true place of
the Sunne about this time correſpondent to this Altitude
according to the late Rud

conſideration to the difference of Meridians and Equation

            which converted into ſexageſmes, is 11 gr. 32 min. 28:
ſec. And if with this we compare the morning variation,
(which ſhould have been the ſame with the
afternoones) the difference will be 32 min: 28 ſec:
               
which may eaſily ariſe either from the Inſufficiency or
Fabrique or groſſe handling of the Inſtruments. So
that if we take the Arithmeticall meane, we may probably
conclude the variation anſwerable to his time
to be about 11 gr. 16 min: with which very neere concurreth
Dr. Gilbert, finding it 11 gr. 20 min.
            From theſe we proceed to Mr. Gunters Obſervations,
the Table whereof we have here inſerted, as we finde
them in his mathematicall workes, where we ſee the
variation not to exceede 6 gr. 13 min. His inſtruments
were one Quadrant of three foote Radius for
the Sunnes Altitudes: His Needles were two, the one
of ſix, the other of 10 Inches in length. The Sunnes
Azimuthes were found by calculation, and the Azimuthes
Magneticall, taken off a Horizontall Plane by a
line of Chordes, whoſe Semidiameter was twelue
Inches.

            Thus haue we prooved that for the Interſtice of 42

yeares, there hath beene an evident diminution of five,
degrees variation. I deny not the Artifice to be very
nice and ſubtle, and that an error may vnawares eaſily
inſinuate it ſelfe, which together with this great
diſcrepance, moved ſome of us to be overhaſty in
caſting an aſperſion of error on Mr. Burrows obſervations,Mr. Iohn Marr.
(though ſince upon noe juſt grounds) till an acquaintance
of ours, lately applying Mr. Gunters owne
Needle to the ſide of the Cubicall Stone of his Majeſties
Diall in White Hall garden, could not finde the
variation ſo great as 6 gr. 15 min: formerly found;
whereupon reſolving with ſome friends to make an experiment
hereof, we went to Diepford the laſt yeare
1633 the day of the Sunnes entrance into the ſummer
Solſtice, to the very ſame place where Mr. Gunter heretofore
had made obſervation, and found it much leſſe
then fiue degrees; And afterwards calling into Queſtion
the Inſufficiency of our Inſtruments, that all
ſcruple might be quite taken away, we had recourſe
this preſent yeare 1634 Ioh. 12. ſtilo vet: to the ſame
Garden of our learned and ingenuous friend Mr. Iohn
Welles, with a Quadrant of ſix foote Radius for ſolar
Altitudes, continually rectified with great care, and a
Horizontall Quadrant of two foote Radius, for the
determining of the Magneticall Azimuthes, exactly
ſet to the Magneticall meridian, and in paralelliſme
to the Horizon; (otherwiſe great error might enſue)
with two Needles of twelue Inches in length well
touch't with good Magnetts; And for the better ſatisfaction,
tooke with us alſo the very ſame Needle
wherewith Mr. Gunter made the foreſaid obſervations,
in length ten Inches; all three muſt, accurately reſpecting

the ſame Magneticall Meridian as we then proved.
And leaſt there might ariſe ſome diverſity in the
variation through the touches of ſeverall Stones, I
cauſed the one Needle firſt touch't by a very good
Magnet, to be retouch't by another as good if no better,
and the ſame wherwith moſt of our zea compaſtes
are touch't, and yet found no difference betweene
them. And ſo Iune the 14. 1634▪ we made theſe following
obſervations, where we found the variation
not to exceed 4 gr. 10 min. as appeareth by the Table
annexed.
            And becauſe in the Reſolutions of theſe obliquangular
ſphaericall Triangles for the Solar Azimuthes we
have neceſſary uſe of the Latitude of the Place, the
ſame we determine by the Sunnes meridian Altitude
to be 51 gr. 30 min. after this manner.

            And for a further confirmation herof (though moved
upon no juſt reaſon to ſuſpect theſe obſervations,
being every way as cautelous in them as poſſible we
could) as ſoone as the intermiſſion from my publique
Exerciſe would permit, I cauſed the ſame inſtruments
to be tranſported to Paules Cray in Kent, diſtant from
London SE and by S about 12 miles, where the fourth
of Iuly following (Fide Aſtronimica) I made the ſubſequent
animadverſions, hardly amounting to 4 degrees.
            The Latitude of the Place I finde by the ſame large

            It were needleſſe having ſo many ſufficient teſtimonyes,
to produce any more; one onely obſervation
made with circumſpection being as good as one hundreth.
So that its plaine, the obſervations made in this
place do all make the variation to fall neere upon 4 degrees.
            Hence therefore we may conclude that for the ſpace
of 54 yeares (the difference of time betweene Mr. Burrowes
and theſe laſt obſervations of ours) there hath
beene a ſenſible diminution of 7 degrees and better.
            If any affected with magneticall Philoſophy ſhall
yet deſire to ſee an experiment made for their owne
particular ſatisfaction, where I may prevaile, I would
adviſe them to pitch a faire ſtone parallell to the Horizon

there to reſt immoveable, and having a Needle
of a convenient length ſtrongly touch't by a vigorous
Magnet to draw a Magneticall Meridian thereby, and
yearely to examine by the application of the ſame (well
preſerved from the ayre and ruſt, its greateſt enemies)
whether time will produce the like alteration.
            I will not here enter into a diſpute concerning the
cauſe of this ſenſible diminution, whether it may be
imputed to the Magnet, or the Earth, or both. It is not
unknowne to the world, how the Greateſt Maſters of
Aſtronomie, which this age hath afforded, for the more
eaſy ſalving the apparent anomalar motions of the fixed
and erratique caeleſtiall lights, and avoyding that
ſupervacaneous furniture of the Ancients, do with all
alacrity embrace that admirable Copernicean Hypotheſis
of the diurnal, Annual, &amp; Secular motions of the earth,
in ſo much as conferring with that Great Aſtronomer
D. Phil. Lanſberg. in Zealand about Aſtronomicall matters,
did moſt ſeriouſly affirme unto me, he ſhould never
be diſſwaded from that Truth. This which he was
pleaſed to ſtile a truth, I ſhould readily receive as an Hypotheſis,
and ſo be eaſily led on to the conſideration of
the imbecillity of Mans apprehenſion, as not able rightly
to conceive of this admirable opifice of God or
frame of the world, without falling foule on ſo great
an abſurdity. Yet ſure I am, it is a probable inducement
to ſhake a wavering underſtanding. And which adds
ſomewhat more, I underſtand by Galilaeus a Florentine,
and a moſt acute and learned Mathematician, that an Italian
Gentleman of the Family of the Marſilii hath lately
found the mutation of the Terreſtriall Meridians, and
penned a treatiſe thereof not yet publiſhed, which the
ſaid Galilaeus hath ſeene and read conſtupore, not without
amazement. His words are theſe.
            
               
Surge di preſente una quinta novita, dalle quale
ſi poſſa arguir mobilita nel globo terreſtre, mediante
quello, che ſottiliſsimamente va ſcoprendo l' illuſtriſsimo
S. Caeſare della nobiliſsima famiglia de i Marſilij
di Bologna, pur' Academico Linceo, il quale
in una dottiſsima ſcrittura va eſponendo, come ha
oſſervato una continua mutazione, benche tardiſsima,
nella linea Meridiana; della quale ſcrittura,
da me ultimamente con ſtupore veduta, ſpero che
douera fare coppia a tutti gli ſtudio ſi delle maraviglie
della natura.
            Which in Engliſh runnes thus.
            Now there ariſeth a fift noveltie, from which we
may argue the mobility of the terereſtriall Globe, by the
meanes of that which moſt ſubtllie the moſt muſtruous
Gentleman Sig: Caeſar of the moſt noble familie of
the Marſilij of Bologna a Lyncean Academicke alſo,
hath diſcovered, who in a moſt learned tract plainely
ſheweth how he hath obſerved a continuall mutation,
although very ſlow, in the Meridian line; which diſcourſe,
which with wonder I lately ſaw, I hope he
will impart to all thoſe who are Studious of the wonders
of nature.
            Surely if it be ſo, the due conſideration of the premiſſes
doth (as I conceive) lay open a faire way for the

ſalving of that Irregular Motion imputed to the Axis
of the Earth. I meane the alterable Obliquity of the
Ecliptique, which to deny (as ſome yet doe, not without
great violence offred to the Ancients) I ſhall hardly
(without very ſtrong argument) be perſwaded. I pretermit
likewiſe a ſuppofition which might be made of the
correſpondent motion of the Pole of the Magnet with
thoſe of ſome of the Planets, and divers other conceits,
which muſt be all left to future times to diſcover, this
Invention being but newly preſented to the world in
its infancy.
