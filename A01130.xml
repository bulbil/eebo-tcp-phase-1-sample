            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

In deed I wandered long in the selfe same mizmaze, nooseled therin by the gray headed of that schoole, whose countenance caried mee from my Christ to the Swinstie of Sorbone, which had swalowed me vp, if the Lord had not preuented me with his mercie betimes. I was, I say, as they are, I am now as I am (Christ Iesus be thanked) a conuert I confesse. The Lord graunt I may stand fast to the glorie of his name, and the good example of others, whose like conuersion I do hartily wish in the Lord. And so desiring thy good praiers to Iesus Christ (gentle Reader) to assist me with his grace, that I may perseuer in this his gracious calling to the ende I wil no longer abuse thy pacience: The Lord Iesus gouerne and guide thee in the true obedience of his glorious Gospel, to the glorie of his name. Amen.

            ¶ The Athour to the freendly Reader.
            
               WHEREas this little treatise offereth it selfe to the viewe without the Authors name, herein whosoeuer he be that compiled it, whether hee bee Dutch, French, or English desireth to hold him excused. Hee thought it more conuenient to produce the holy vniuersall and Apostolique Churche it selfe speaking in her owne person, name, and voyce: that so she might debate her owne cause being publique &amp; not priuat against her aduersary the Pope with greater grauitie and maiestie. For as the Lorde hath not geuen equabilitie of estate to all persons alike, &amp; as one and the selfe same maner of speache accordeth not with all sortes of men: So was it not seemely to depende the generall greeuaunce of all nations, &amp; the vniuersall complaint of all people vpon the mouth of any one priuate person: as neither woulde one maner of pleading in so weightie a matter become any one priuate Aduocate. With another maner of coūtenāce speaketh Cicero as a Consul and Iudge, then when as a priuate Orator hee pleadeth at the common barre. Certes our lot hath beene so vnluckie to light vppon these dayes nowe, all matters being so on all parts enuenimed with poyson, and so on all sides waxen cankred and incurable, that neither indeuoure nor petition, praier, nor wholsome admonition of any priuate person were able in any respect to auaile. For this Romane rufler maketh not so slender an accompt of his Peacockes plummes, as to vouchsafe any priuate counsale

or correction. This hydeous Hydre requireth too be matched with mightier countenances and powers of greater estate: whether the Lord Christ himself wyl vouchsafe to destroy this monster with the breath of his mouth frō out of heauē: or whether the excellent maiestie of mightie Potentates and Monarches of the earth, vniting all theyr Councelles in one wyl not disdaine of their authorities royal to become publique Vmpieres here, &amp; yeeld their princely assistāce to the suppressing of this insolēt outrage. Wherfore if ought in this treatie may seeme (gentle Reader) to haue byn vttered with ouermuch bitternesse of speach: Imagine in thy minde of this discourse, as though it proceeded not from any one particular member of the Churche alone, but from the whole Church it selfe, or from Peter or Paul, or else frō the whole parliament of the Apostles proclaiming their generall consentes, voyces, and mutuall agreements by their authoritie Apostolique: who, as did in times past with incredible trauaile and industrie plant and enlarge the boundes of Christs Church, so if they were liuing now, and beheld with their eyes the merueilous misdemeanors and disorders of the Churche, without all peraduenture they woulde thunder out far more bitter and sharper stormes of reproouing speaches against this horrible aduersarie of Christe. The Lorde Iesu blesse thee, Christian Reader.

repose all their affiaunce and confidence in him: Finally whereas in their churches, all matters, are so orderly administred by them, as that no defect may be founde of any thing apperteining too the duetie of true christianitie:The Pope cruelly raging against the godly without all cause or reason. wherein nothing is admitted, that is not consonant to the sacred authoritie of the Euangelicall institution: I beseech you (Syr Pope of Rome) what woulde you desire more? What? seemeth it not sufficient in your conceite, that Christ, who alone preserueth the estate of his church be glorified in his owne Church, vnlesse the pompe of the Pope be enterlaced with the glory of Christ, &amp; reuerenced with semblable obedience? And from whence els come these tumultes, these flashes of lightening, and stormes of of thunderboltes raysed vpp? Is it bicause they doe yeelde their obedience too Christe, as it behooueth them to doe? or bicause they humble not thē selues to the Pope?

But if ye thinke it not sufficient, that the sonne of GOD may be magnified without the Romish Bishop, why then surcease from hencefoorth to be taken for the seruaunt of Iesu, and the heire of Peter. For what other thing did Peter or Paule vaunt vpon, but the onely glory of Iesu Christ?

That Christ himselfe, whiles hee dwelte here vpon earth, would haue a speciall testimonie lefte behinde him, howe farre he was both in woordes, and deedes estraunged from crauing, or groping after glorie, who embasing him selfe of his owne freewill, euen to the ignominie of the Crosse: by howe much he disclaimed from the title of glory, so much the

But Christ notwithstanding is receiued: him doe they imbrace as their Lorde: his voice they doe acknowledge, and bee obedient vnto: but because they knowe not you (Sir Pope) if they receiue you not, why should you storme at it? You require pardie that they shoulde couple you with Christ in their worshipping. But put the case, that Christ can in no wise bee receiued into England, vnlesse the Pope be banished:Christ can not be receaued vnlesse the Pope be banished. neither the Pope haue any possible footing there, except they thruste Christe cleane out of their Coastes: Whether of these two thinke you conuenient to bee obeyed by them, since they can not possibly serue bothe at once? Iohn the most worthy Prophet of all Prophets, yea more then a Prophet, doth cry out in the Desert: It behoueth that he increase, and that I doe diminish.

                What (say they) do we not call them Lordes commonly, who, as Gods Ministers, do exercise princely authoritie, and regiment ouer the earth? Yes truely: and therefore let euerie prouince haue his peculiar seignior, who according to Gods appointment, may exercise this function of bearing gouernement and rule. But what is this to Peter? What is this to the Apostles, and Apostolique Ministers: who be called to this function, to this onely ende, to profite the congregation of Christ, and not ouerrule them, as Princes and Potentates: to nourishe and feede the flocke of their Lord, not Lordly, and loftily to ouercrowe them, as Lordes of the flocke? For their estate is not an estate of stately domination, and tyrannical superioritie, but an office, a charge, and a shepeherdes estate. And as it is a charge,How the charge of a Sheapeheard
                     •
                   is limited and howe it ought to be discharged. so ought the same charge be stretched no further, than for whose sake properly it is vndertaken: so also neither ought it be applied otherwise in any respect, then as it shall apperteine to the proper and peculiar benefite of the flocke. For neither the Scholemaister may therefore take vpon him to ouerrule his pupilles, as Parents do their children, or as Princes their subiectes: bycause

his office is to instruct thē in learning: neither is he otherwise worthie the place of a Schoolemaister, then in that respect that he may teach good and wholesome doctrine. In like maner, whereas the office of a godly pastor consisteth in this onely, to direct the consciences of Christians, to employ all his studie and trauel to the enlargement of Christes kingdome, he ought for this cause abide vnremoueable within the bounds of his charge, &amp; therein behaue himselfe as a shepeheard, not as a Lorde: as a seruant, not as a maister. It is one thing to beare soueraintie by publike and Christian authoritie: an other thing to be a seruant, in feeding the flocke, and to be subiect to the state: And yet neither doeth this kinde of seruice want his proper and peculiar dignitie. As in all common weales the most renowmed &amp; famous actions do of their owne nature, allure the wel liking, and laudable commendation of the godly: So Ministers of the Church also, such as being endued with heauenly giftes of spiritual blessing, and the mightie power of Christ Iesus, though they groape not greedily for promotion, shall neuer yet bee destitute of their due honour and reuerence, which of it owne nature doth alwayes attend vpon and accompanie godly and famous personages: I meane not any such dignity notwtstanding, as should raise thē to the state of princes, nor make them Lordes of the earth, ne yet aduaunce them to Monarchies, nor so much as priuiledge them frō due obedience to the state, nor to the Lawes and Statutes of the higher powers.
            Therefore as concerning the prerogatiue of Princes, sithens there is so great a number of Regions. Nations, and people, such a varietie of Lawes and tongues, nothing can be more seemely, nor more consonant for the ordinance of God, then that in al societies and estates of Nations, a special preeminence, and singular superiority should be yeelded to some one personage, as to a certaine

chiefe gouernour and heade, by whose authoritie and soueraigntie, al others may be trayned vnder whom also seueral offices, and charges may be seuerally distributed, as shal seeme necessarie and commodious, for the well ordering of euery weale publike. Hereof is it,
                  Rom. 13. 
               That the higher powers do of right beare a necessarie preeminence directly vnder God, as the Apostle witnesseth. And yet euen the selfe same powers are empale

               , &amp; compassed in within their prescripts, listes, limits, &amp; boundes according to Gods ordinance. But as to that vniuersalitie, and Ierarchie ouer the whole Church of Christ:One onely vniuer

And what was he then that at any time hath authorised you (yee Prelate of Rome) to bee chiefe gouernour, and Lorde ouer the vniuersall Church of Christ, so farre and wide ouerstretched, ouer the face of the whole earth? Or who euer besides you hath beene heard of, that durst presume vpon so prowde a Title of superioritie, eyther in the Apostles tyme, or in the whole succeeding age, vntill this your chalenge, without great reproche and greeuous controulement of euerie good man? Or with what face at the length dare your selfe so arrogantly rayse vppe your crest so Luciferlyke, as to bee magnified for the onely and principall Bishoppe, and Monarchie of the whole state of Christianitie, vnlesse ye were Antichrist him selfe? In this case therefore, aduise and bethinke your selfe well, yee Romish Prelate, what ye nowe doe, or rather what ye ought to doe. If yee thinke that the credite of your Maiestie is crackt by them, bycause they haue banished you out of theyr Coasts: I pray you heartely when it commeth to your minde, to make a true account, howe much they haue bene beneficial vnto you &amp; others of your crew, whiles they were your vassals, tel vs now this one thing,

what secrete insolencie lurketh in that authoritie of your maiestie, that may by an vnauoidable necessitie enforce them to the lyke superfluous pillage any longer.

                  e.For why shoulde they so do? is it because you may graunt them saluation, and blesse them? But their saluation is already plentifull, sufficient and euerlasting for them in our onely Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ. Is it because you may geue them remission of sinnes? but the same is also geuen them freely in the faith of the Gospell, without any other ayde. What is it then? Because you may preach the woorde of God to Gods people? or is it rather because ye may, as ye haue hitherto accustomed, thrust vpon them mens traditions, pelting gloses, and olde wiues tales in steede of Christes Gospell? that yee may rob the lay people of the woorde of God, with holding it fast lockt from them, in an vnknowne and barbarous tongue? That yee may scatter abroade the doctrine of Diuelles? But the Lorde be highly thanked for it, there lacketh no store of godly personages amongst them, which are able too execute that holy function of preaching Gods woorde, and do execute it indeede without ayde of the Laterane Bishopp freely, and with good successe: yea so muche the more freely, by howe muche they bee seuered from your tyranny by distaunce of place. What is the cause thē? that ye may determin their causes and controuersies? But where may controuersies bee more happily decided, and more speedily ended, then where the speciall circumstances of the greeuances began first, and are best knowne? Heere of came that sacred decree of those godly Fathers in the Africane Councell as Cyprian doth testifie:
                  Cyprian the first booke, the third Epistle. 
               That euery mans cause should bee pleaded in the same prouince where the offence was cōmitted, wher also might be both accusers and witnesses of the cryme. And for this cause it was decreed further: That to euery pastor some particular

portion of the flocke shoulde bee appoynted, which euery of them shoulde rule and direct, rendering accounte of his proceedings therein to the Lorde &amp;c. In their Englishe affayres therefore what interest may the Romishe Inquisition challenge, sithens the States of his owne Nation of Affricke haue vtterly renounced it?
            But happily the authoritie of the Pope is holden verie necessarie to choose Byshoppes, and to dispose other orders Ecclesiastical: for this they mainteyne for inuiolable, that all maner election of Bishops is vtterly vnlawfull, except they bee consecrated by the Romishe Sea. But what is this else, then to robbe the Churche of her lawfull right and interest in her free election, and to yeeld ouer the Church her selfe (which ought to be the Spouse of Christ) a seruile bondmayde to the Pope, and not the Pope to the Church? when as notwithstanding the Apostle Paule, writing to the Corinthians, doubted nothing at all to make the Apostles themselues subiect to the Church speaking on this wise:The Church in respect of soueraigntie, is aboue Apostles and Ministers. 1. Cor. 3. 
               All thinges are yours (sayeth he) whether it bee Paule, or Cephas, or Apollo, whether they be thinges present or things to come, but you are Christes, (hee doth not say, you are the Popes) and Christ is God. Briefely, as concerning that laying on of handes, which the Papistes account altogither vnlawfull without the Popes annoynting, why shoulde it bee lesse lawfull for vs, to put the same in execution in our Churches, in ecclesiasticall elections, and ordering our owne Ministers and Pastours, then the Cardinalles of Rome in the choise of their Pope? For sithens in Rome it selfe is no such necessarie succession of personages, or Palles, but that which is purchased for the penie: and sithens no consecration almost doeth passe there, that is not rather besmeared with Oyle of money, then with any Oyle else,

So might you not in any wyse haue misdoughted, but that he vpon some good liking of your cause, vndertaking the defence thereof, woulde of his sincere Iustice both more orderly &amp; more mightely haue repulsed the iniury, then your self were able too doo. For proofe wherof as there be sundry examples in the scripture, so amongst al other that counsel of Gamaliel, wherewith he appeased the outragious insolency of the Pharisees from sleing the Apostles, ought to haue bin remembred agreeing with Gamaliel in counsel.
                  Actes 3. 
               If that which these men do, be of men, or the counsel of men, it will come too nought of it self. But if this coūsel be of God, thē shall I as wickedly as in vayne striue against it, as one not only rebellious against men, but against God himselfe.
            Al which I do hither too debate with you in such sorte, as if you had iust cause of complaint, were it neuer so litle against vs for empayring your dignity: which if it were true, yet doth not the Apostolique grauitie vsually let loose the reynes of priuate reuenge so grieuously, nor any of the scripture enstruct therevnto.

Who so shoulde depart from this Church (as much to say) from the Pope, might not otherwise hope for eternal saluation by anie meanes: whatsoeuer the Pope should speake or doe, could be no errour, neither ought he bee iudged of anie person: And that Christ did reigne in heauen, the Pope must reigne in earth. And albeit Christ did promise that hee woulde bee alwayes present with his Church, yet must this bee an infallible rule, That hee coulde not dispose the riches of his grace, in the gouernement of his Church otherwise, than by the dispensation of this Gentleman his onely Uicar.

Churche nothyng sounde in doctrine, scarse any tytle voyde of corruption: the true woorshippe of GOD conuerted to a gaynful merchandize: the faith of the Gospell turned into outwarde and Apish Ceremonies. The Churche it selfe cleane transformed out of kinde, intoo a kyngdome, not like to that of Plato, but into a Bishoply and Princely Seignory in place of Christes true religion, which ought too haue beene one vniforme and generall to all, crept in particular rules of Fraunces, Dominicke, Brigit and sixe hundred other strange religions besides. In steede of true worshipping of God, innumerable feastes of Saints were celebrated in steede of true inuocatiō of Gods holy name, Pilgrimages were vowed, Iubiles, Stations of Saints, Reliques and worshipping of Images.Errors and confusion in the popes doctrine. Finally in the place of Christ, the Pope bare dominion not only in temples, but euen in the consciences of men. Christ sate in heauen, but the Pope Christ his vicar reigned on earth, in power surmounting all Kings and Monarches so much, by how muche the Mathematikes haue apporcioned the Sunne to exceede the Moone in quantitie, to wit, seuentie times seuen. He was accounted the only fountaine of all iurisdictions, from whose fulnesse behooued all Bishops to drawe their authoritie without all question. What needeth any long processe? Assoone as the Church began to chaunge his head, and the Pope ganne too take vppon hym the place of Christe: foorthwith came to passe, that togeather with this newe heade, vpstart suche a femshapen visour of religion, as scarse any one iotte of the auncient discipline remained vnpolluted. For the Scriptures beeyng now commaunded too silence, nothing coulde be heard, nothing coulde bee deliuered, too feede the humours of suche, as woulde haue beene learned, but Canons Lawes, Decrees, and Decretalles of the Pope,

For this Article was the very sinowes, bones, and marrow of most absolute religion: couple here with satisfactions, Purgatorie pickpurse, the vnblooddy sacrifice of the Masse, assurednesse of saluation, not depending vpon Christe only and faith in him, but to bee purchased

Wherefore if in this forraine quarell, which the Subiects withstoode, they had beene ouerthrowne, yet ought they not haue beene deemed rebels for standing in their owne defence: neither if the king had va

Nay rather to this ende dyd they mainteyne their defence, that it might be lawful for them as subiectes to obey their owne and one only gouernour on earth, exempt from all other hautie vsurpation of forreine power, and yeelde their humble alleageaunce to their naturall Kyng onely, and not to two Monarches in one kingdome: and that their liege Lorde would permyt them quietly to enioy suche priuiledges and lawes, which his highnes had established amongest them. To this onely ende tended all that honest and necessary defence of the subiects: so that now may appeare manifestly, that their entering into armes was not against their Kyng, but rather altogether for their kynges behoofe: Yea on such conditions en

Wherein I pray you beholde, yee gentle companions, howe iniuriously and vnhonestly you abuse both the name of Christ, and the simplicitie of Christians, when as you require vs to that, which we can neither with safe conscience yelde vnto you, nor, if wee did so, you could accept without great iniury to others, and your farre greater infamy and shame, as shall appeare by this one wytnesse whome I haue cyted, to wytte, Pope Gregorye.

                very earnestly requiryng him that from thencefoorth hee shoulde neuer vse any suche voyce of commaunde, nor any other surname of glorious vniuersalitie in any his wrytings:
Because (sayth hee) I knowe what I am, and what you bee: for in function you bee my brethren, in conuersation my fathers. And so lykewyse annexeth this sentence touchyng the title on this wyse, which I doe in this place more willingly set downe, because not only the proce

               Because (sayeth hee) so much is derogated from your dignitie, as is more then reasonably yelded to any other. I doe not desire to bee honoured in wordes, but in good lyfe: neyther doe I accompt that to be honour, wherein I doe knowe my brethren to bee any iotte abridged of their honour. &amp;c. I would wishe therfore all such as with so gaye a countenaunce of religion doe striue so lustely about the prerogatiue of the Romish Sea, to haue an especiall regard and consideration of the wordes of Gregory in this place.
            
               My honour (sayth he) is the honour of the vniuersal

Church:
                     Gregorie in the same place. my honour is the flourishing honour of my brethren: then am I honoured aright, when due honour is not denied to euerie particular brother. For if your holinesse do cal me vniuersall Pope, you renounce your s

And againe in another place, writing to the Bishop of Constantinople, requireth him to be well aduised what he enter vpon, bycause in that presumptuous rashnesse the vnitie of the whole Church is peruerted vpside downe:
                  Gregorie in the 4. booke the 38 Epistle to the Bishop of Constantinople. and thereby aryseth a flat denyall of the generall grace powred vpon all indifferently. And forthwith after:
For what else be your Bishoppes of the vniuersall Church, but the Starres of heauen, aboue whome whilest thou presumest to exalt thy selfe by prowde title of stately souereigntie, what emplie these woordes else, but that I will ascende into heauen, and will exalt my Seate aboue the Starres of heauen? &amp;c.
Adding moreouer in the same epistle no lesse wisely, then considerately an admonition both to himselfe, and the other Bishoppes.

                  Pro. 17. whereof Solomon maketh mention: Hee that buildeth his house too high, seeketh the ruine thereof. But why do I vouch this one testimonie of Gregorie onely, when as neuer any one so much of all Gregories predecessours was euer heard of, which woulde take vppon him the name of vniuersall Bishoppe, or the heade of the vniuersall Church?

Heare therefore, yea heare (ye Popishe Prelate) if credite may be giuen to Gregory, that besides Christe there is no heade of the Churche that ought to bee reputed for vniuersall, appliable neyther to Paul, neyther to Peter, nor to any other of all the Apostles. And dare you yet challendge to your selfe, that, which Gregory dareth not yelde to the chiefest Apostles, which also the scripture it selfe denieth vnto them?

                  . and the first that was called by the name of an Apostle: yet this wyll wee not graunt surely, that hee was heade of the Churche, or the vniuersall Apostle. The one whereof Gregory doeth discharge him off, the other the infallible trueth of the sacred Scripture doeth vtterly deny him. For what can be more manifest, or more substantiall, then that true saying of Paule, wherein he holdly pronounceth that the Apostleshyppe of Peter

stretched not out generally ouer all:
                  Galat. 2. but was streighted to the boundes of the Circumcised only, limitted thereunto, as it were by specially lotte: and that vnto him selfe authoritie was geuen directly from the Lorde to bee an Apostle of the Gentiles: which also Christe himself &amp; the holy Ghoste doe verifie to bee true by an vndoubted Oracle: when as leauing Peter in his natiue Countrey, hee commaunded Barnabas and Saule to bee separated vnto him, for the woorke whereunto he had called them? Nowe what kinde of woorke was this else, but that they shoulde bee sente foorth a farre of vnto the Gentyles? whereby appeareth without all controuersie: that this generall charge, and ouersight of the whole worlde was not more peculiarly layde vpon the shoulders of Peter, then vpon Paule, Barnabas and the other Apostles. Heereof also came it that to bee the Apostle of the Gentyles, was properly and peculiarly ascribed vnto Paule, and not vnto Peter by the generall testimonie of all men. In like maner Chrysostome making mention of Paul:

Paule acknowledged no maner of Superiorie in Peter aboue the reste of the Apostles, testifiyng plainly that he auayled him nothing at al: and that they ioyned handes as fellowes of one societie. And will the successor of Peter bee so foole hardie, as to admit no mate in the ministery of Christes commission with him? what horrible iugling, lying and legerdemaine is this? what more then shamelesse and whorish impudencie is this?

If these woordes spoken by Christe his owne mouth be true, As the liuing Father sent me, euen so do I also send you: Then must this also bee most true: that sithens by this speache hee noted no one particularly, therefore ought no person challendge any such prerogatiue, as to execute heere his office, as his onely Uicar on earth. And yet I alleadge not this to the ende, I woulde perswade to disanull, or roote out of Gods Churche, receiued and approoued degrees, estates and orders of the Churche, nor those degrees of superiour placing in holy Churches discretely deliuered from the auncient Fathers, namely: That in euery Diocesse shoulde bee some one superintendent ouer the inferiour Churches, vnto whom the reste might resorte for Counsell and for auoyding of schismes.

                  Luke .14. and when as hee commaundeth them too shunne the first places in the Sinagogues,
                  Iohn .13. and stately salutations in the Streates:
                  Matth. 23. when as hee calleth them backe so busily,
                  Luke .16. to abandon the pride and hautinesse of this worlde:
                  Matth. 5. too eschewe the mightie thinges of this worlde, to imbrace the basenesse of the Spirite, and paciently to susteyne all iniuries of aduersaries? When as Peter also forbad so expresly: That yee become not Lords ouer the Cleargie, and Paule likewise, not too frame their life according to the fashiō of this world: I haue now declared sufficiently, howe that the very meaning of Christe, and the continuall course of his discipline in the holy Scriptures, coulde neuer digest that vniuersall and more then kingly ambitious seeking of superiorite of this Sea. Now would I faine learn what you ean replie against it: what answere yee can make, sir Pope? &amp; what ye haue to alleadge, yea what can yee imagine to colour this glorious title withal? what? was not Peter (wil ye say) prince of the apostles? what a ieast is this? As though the apostles were not al of one spirit? all

of one callyng? or as though ye can vouch any one place in all the Scriptures to iustifie that Peter was inuested in any superioritie of power, aboue the rest, which either he receiued at any time, or which Christe euer gaue him? Or as though the times were suche in theyr dayes, as woulde permit the holy Apostles to be so idlely disposed, as once to think or to dreame vpō any principalitie, being as then in hurly burly, turmoyled and broyled with daily feares and continuall perrils? Yet I wyl not denie, but Peter hath byn sundry times blazed out with that braue name of Prince of Apostles,In what sense Peter was calle

The Grecians doe say thē

And afterwards to prooue his threatnings true, he procured Otto Duke of Saxon to bid him battell: by meanes whereof, how cruel, how many, &amp; how mercilesse massacres ensued, what slaughter, what effusion and confusion of Christian blood, people and nations, I meane not here to stand vpon.

It is not dignitie (sayth one) nor the place of the godly that maketh a bishop, but the good life: nor is euery one to be accepted for a Doue, that can say, peace be vnto you. The grace of God is promised

to true holinesse and true faith, not to any chaire or succession: for the chaires do not make the churche, but be subiect to the ordinance of the church. Wherein consideration must be had, not of the continuance of the place, but of the sinceritie of the successor.

Goe to, and what shalbe sayde of the Apostles then, who hauing no maner of right in ordinary succession, were the first founders of the churche of Christe, and renounced vtterly the ordinary priesthood? To be briefe: If to sitte in a place, bee of such efficacie and force, I suppose the temple of God be farre more honourable then the chayre of Peter. And yet in this very temple of God, Antichriste must haue his chayre, according to the testimony of the propheticall scriptures. Shall Antichrist be therefore called holy Antichriste in respecte of his seate? To conclude: Let it be as forcible as it may for the church, to haue what seate, or what foundation it will, so that it holde fast the liuely spirite of Christe, his holy worde and sacramentes, by the which it is begotten sanctified, and made holy.

Christ. But you, holy father, sitting in the Romish chayre at Rome, what teache you, but the doctryne of deuils?

               ce out the matter amongest the auncient doctors are alledged as champions of valour, Tertullian, Irene, and Augustine, who doo not a little aduaunce the dignitie of ecclesiastical succession. They doo yeelde to the Church honor in deede: but how? and when? forsooth in their disputations to confirme the antiquity of the scriptures, against such as did vtterly deny them. Let vs also consider the tyme when they did so: foorsooth euen then, when as the very auncient integritie of godlinesse, vertue, true religion, and sinceritie of doctryne was resiaunt in the succession of Bishoppes: and when as yet the Sea of Rome taught nothing else, but that which was agreable too the Catholicke doctrine, approued and allowed in Christian Churches. Hithertoo yet was no cause giuen why they shoulde make any special complaint against that Sea: the fundation whereof they had hearde say might bee attributed too Peter especially, by
                  •
               ause they perceaued that the countenaunce thereof auailed much to the appeasing of schismes. But if Augustine and the other auncient Fathers were lyuing nowe, and shoulde heare and see these horrible heresies, monstruouse maskinges, and peeuishe puppettes, wherewith this holy Sea ouerwhelmeth the whole world at this present, they woulde chaunge their note, and sing a farre other manner of song of the intollerable pryde and ambition of this Sea: and woulde with no lesse vehemency of spirite, then other godly mynisters at this present,The ordinary succession of pope

out with a carde of tenne as it were, which hath beene so many yeeres turmoyled with schismes, encombred with so many chaunces and chaunges of bishoppes, eche striuing against other for the title of that Sea: where many tymes three Popes, and for the more parte twoo Popes haue challenged the chayre: not vnlyke lusty gallaunces who bee ielouse of theyr paramoures: in so much that it coulde not bee easily discerned who ought to bee receaued for the true Pope: that I speake nothing meanewhyles of al those which by fraude, by symony, by violence, by murthers, by witchecraft, necromancy, and diuelishe practises, I say not, haue crept couertly in, but rudely rusht vppon the foresaide succession. To passe also ouer, that filthy discontinuance of the same Sea, wherin was chopt into chayre as successor, not Iohn a bishop, but Ioane that shamelesse strūpet: whose successors they must needes confesse themselues to bee euen as yet, if to deriue the succeeding order of successiue Prelates, from the direct lyne of the predecessors, bee of so greate emportaunce.

And heerein surely the matter is come to a good issue, That suche a durtie religion is fathered vpon so drowsie a dotterell: for suche is the religion, as nothing can be more superstitious, nothing more estraunged from Christe: Suche is your life, as nothing can bee more pernicious too the tranquillitie and peace of Christians.

Shal they bee all accounted to be without the body of Christe, which doe acknowledge Christe for their supreme head? What? is it of more emportance to be slaues vnto the Pope, then to bee souldiers vnto Chris
                  •
               ? No: But they affirme, that there is no Churche, where the Pope is not head. What Church then I pray you, was that in Asia and Palestine before Peter euer sawe Rome? Yea put the case Peter had neuer seene Rome in all his life: shoulde there therefore haue beene no Churche at all? Doth the state of Bishops make the Churche of Christe to be a Churche, or doth the authoritie of the Churche make Bishops? But they say there is no hope of saluation without the church: I do heare it, and confesse it to be true: yet this is no good argument to prooue, that there is no Church at al, except it be subiect to the Pope. I adde moreouer, That where they say, that there is no hope of saluation without the Church:How this saying [without the Churche, is no hope of saluation] must be con

Whereby it commeth to passe, that whosoeuer is made partaker of sauing health in Christ being the head: the same can in no wise bee a straunger from the socie

Christ the heade and prince of the Church.
            Which beeing concluded vpon: with what arguments nowe doth this counterfeyte successour of Peter conuince vs for outcasts and Apostataes from partaking with the bodie, who through fayth bee engraffed into Christ? Who bee not seuered from the true and Catholike fayth of Christ? For if nothing else make an vtter separation from Christ, but obstinate rebellion from Christian fayth and Christian conuersation: what treacherous rebellion eyther in our doctrine, or in our maners can these Romanistes espie in vs, so blame worthie, which may not much more iustly be rebounded vpon their owne backes?

            THE POPE CONFVTED. THE HOLY AND APOSTOLICAL CHVRCHE CONFVTING THE ERROVRS OF THE POPES DOCTRINE. THE SECOND ACTION.

               ly ynough, I suppose, by the former discourse, that wee haue not departed from out the Church of Christ, in that we haue sequestre

                our selues from the Romish Sinagogue. In this present action therefore, nowe it may seeme conuenient that we render the reason that moued vs to renoūce that Romish route, and set downe as briefly as we may, the verie pointes withall, wherein we swarue from them. Wherein neuerthelesse shal not bee altogither amisse to aduertise the gentle Readers hereof chiefly, That we entred into this controuersie agaynst the aduersaries, not of anie set purpose to rayse contention and debate in the Church, nor of any desire to quarell and contende, nor yet of any euill affection that wee beare to the persons themselues, agaynst whome wee maintaine argument: n
                  •
                yet for that we woulde not much more willingly bee coupled with them in one lincke of Christian vnitie and concord, if the vnitie, which they offered vnto vs, were such as we might by any meanes yeeld vnto, without preiudice of the fayth and glorie of Christ, without staine of conscience, without manifest treachery and Apostasie, or without vnauoydable daunger of the safetie of our soule. But the matter being now growne to this poynt, that we can

by no possible meanes be at vnitie with Christ, if we partake with them, what remaineth then at the length wherin they may eyther iustify agaynst vs, or alledge for further defence in their owne behalfe? If they accuse vs of Apostasie, or falling from them, let them then first by plaine demonstration make manifest the verie nature of right Apostasie. Surely if those that haue seuered themselues from the Primitiue and true Catholilike Church, and be reuolted from the first founders of Christian faith, from the auncient Fathers, from the Apostles, from the infallible principles of the Euangelical doctrine, to an other doctrine, to mens traditions, to forreine forged nouelties of Religion, to worshipping of Idols, to a strange Gospel altogether vnknowne to the Apostles, to patter praiers in vnknowne and barbarous speeches, may rightly be called plaine runnagates, no men in the worlde deserue to be called Apostataes in my iudgement more properly and truly, than this generation of Papists broode.
            But here againe will some one of them replie, that they stande vpon a good grounde of possession, not able to be gainesayde, which they holde of the holy and Catholike Church neuer discontinued, since the verie age and time of the Apostles themselues: from the which they say, that wee being but fewe in number, hedgecreepers as it were in corners, through treacherous backsliding, haue (as it were abandoning our natiue Country, &amp; shrowding our selues in the hil Auentine) withdrawē our selues like rebels.

In the Church of Christ, sayeth Augustine, consideration must bee had of the grauitie of the matter, and not of the number of voyces: and it happeneth oftentimes that the greater number preuayleth agaynst the better, by number of polles rather, than by trial of trueth: yea Christ himselfe

Yet for al this, if a true computation may be yeelded of men, of nations and people, by the poll it self, of al such, as with al their hartes do detest the fraudes and contagion of the Romishe false religion, there wil not so small a number appeare in their eyes, as happly either they coniecture themselues, or at lest ought to make so slender accompt of.
            But as concerning the Churche it self, let them vnderstand &amp; persuade themselues thus: That wheresoeuer the true church of Christ is resiaunt, there we do plead in possession, &amp; iustifie our true and vndoubted tenure therein. Of which church, they be called tenaūts in deed by name, but haue vtterly lost their whole interest and right therof.

So also were the bishops of that most happy age mainteined with the only beneuolence of the people, contented with the basenes of their own estate: In the meane time if there remained any surplus beyond dayly necessities, the same was deliuered back to the poore: At what tyme palaces of prelats were nought els but treasuries of the poore.

is this? do ye on this wise compare so sacred a Sea to the Agarenes and Saracenes, seeing that these do carry no shewe, or any resemblance at all of the visible churche? neither ought to be named by the name of Christiās? On the other side though the Patriarke of Rome, be not allowed amongst you as head of the church, yet can he not be denied to bee a member of the visible churche, and to haue a place amōgst the Christian congregation.

For the church did neither heretofore alwayes confesse the Romish faith that is now to be vniuersall: neither doth the vniuersall churche of the whole worlde confesse the same at this present: as the which groundeth her ankerholde vpon the Apostolike faith, and not vpon the Romishe faith.

All maner of departures therefore, neither the departures of all persones, ne yet from all societie of companies, ought to bee accompted blameworthy.

It was counted a great fault amongst the Iewes in the olde time, and that also sharply rebuked not without cause, for that being so immoderately affected to their ceremonies, and traditions, they regarded not the commaundements of God, and esteemed more of mens traditions, than of Gods commandemēts. Make a comparison now betwixt these holy Prelates of the Romish Court, with those Iewes: &amp; what shall ye finde in thē, that doth not onely resemble Iewishnesse in that kinde of superstition, but also farre &amp; wonderfully exceede it? For plaine demonstration whereof, consider the streight iniunctions for breach of their decrees, the mercilesse proceedings of their cruel iudgements, the vntractable difficultie to obteine pardon for them that do transgresse the Popes lawes, that breake their vowes, &amp; offend in the decrees and traditions of men, rather then for such as doe notoriously trespasse in the commaundements of God.

applied neerest to Christ were alwayes despised most: and that the Disciple cannot bee greater than his maister: certes it can not possibly bee, that this Churche of the Pope, so mightie, and glorious in the worlde, so renowmed and famous in worldly pompe, and exc

                  Ephesians 2. 
               That life euerlasting is the gyft of God, not of any worke, least any man should boast himselfe?
            
            Our Lorde and Sauiour Christe vndoubtedly dyd instruct vs in his Gospell farre other wise then these Lordly Fathers, as the which hath directed the onely way to heauen, not to passe thither by woorkes, but by faith: He that beleeueth in me (sayth he) hath life euerlasting. Againe setting downe a speciall marke,
                  Iohn .6. promiseth That he that seeth the Sonne, and beleeueth on him, shall haue life euerlasting. And redoubling the same promise else where,
                  Iohn .11. 
               He that beleeueth in mee shall not die for euer. And why rather did he not vse these speaches with these gay woorkemaisters? To wit, that they which did lead heere in this worlde an holy and vpright life ful of good woorkes,Euerlasting life promised to the beleeuers. shoulde thereby purchase heauen.
            What then? because all thinges bee ascribed vntoo faith, passing ouer all mention of woorkes: shal we therfore condemne this doctrine as an vtter aduersary too works, making no estimate of holy and vertuous liuing?

You wyl say that they will auaile very much, for we yeeld to God dutifull thankfulnesse, and to our neighbour necessary ayde, and thereby many times doe obteine of God honour and estimation not only to our selues, but for the common weale also, and bee many times preserued wonderfully, &amp; rewarded by god, the most assured rewarder of all godly actions according to the most euident testimonie of the Psalmographe saying on this wise:

Admit this I say to bee true: Neuerthelesse for as much as this rewarde it selfe and recompencing of good workes doth not stretch it selfe beyond the limitted boundes of this present life, this is also vndoubted true that when wee haue made a curious collection of all the most famous and most exquisite workes, yea of the best holy ones in the worlde, yet in respect of the principall fountaine and originall cause of iustification all this huge heape of our woorkes and merites doe nothing at al auaile to purchase immortalitie of eternal life with God and his holy Angels, nor to obteine to be raised from the dead

Euē so they which gadd to Rome to visit the tombe of Peter and Paul, or raunge to Compostella to see S. Iames, or which doo conceaue in their mindes that the Sainctes be more effectual in one place then in an other, what say they els, then loe here is Christ, loe there is Christ. If the heauenly father doo require such woorshippers which woorshippe him in spirite and trueth, to what purpose serueth so special a prescription of stations, and holy Seas, so greate and tediouse chace &amp; rechace hither and thitherof pilgrims, for deuotion sake.
            Hithertoo haue I disclosed the maskinges of the Popish religion, though not al that I could, yet as many as wil serue our present purpose sufficiently ynough. Nowe that I may bee so bolde to leade the Pope home too his owne person: I will call him backe to the very roote of his progeny and stocke, euen to Saint Peter himselfe: whome as hee vaunteth to bee the founder of his Sea, so will I vouche the same against him for a witnesse too confounde his doctryne. This therefore do I demaunde of this good Syre: whether Saint Peter ought to bee numbered in the number of the Apostles? I perceaue hee dooth not deny it. I proceede then, and demaunde further: whether Saint Peter were one of the same number of Apostles to whome it was spoken:Peter the Apostle is denied to haue beene bishop of Rome. 
               Go yee intoo the whole world preaching to euery creature. If you graūt it, as yee can not wel deny it: I aske now whether the order Apostolique be the self same estate which beareth to name Bishops? If the functions bee seueral, howe coulde both the estates bee giuen to one selfe person:The functions of Apostles and Bishoppes bee diuerse. to wit that Peter shoulde exercise the office both of an Apostle, and of a Bishoppe? Then doo I desire to knowe: If Christe did sende out Peter togither with the other Apostles into

               That is geuen and broken for you: To wit, to signifie vnto them not the very substaunce of his naturall body simply, but that the crucifiyng of his body and the shedding of his blood shoulde become our foode. From hence bubbleth out al that welspring of error, That where our Lorde and Sauiour had relation to the efficacie and power of his passion, the same the Papistes doe apply too the only substance of the fleshe, as though we were to bee fed with the very naturall fleshe of Christe:The fleshe of Christ doth not feede vs properly, but the passion of Christ. and not rather with the passion of his fleshe. But you wyll aske howe the passion of Christe feedeth, which is not eaten: forsooth, in the same maner as the death of Christ doth nourishe vs, so doeth his passion feede vs, not after a fleshly but after a spiritual maner.

                Not as it is chawed with the teeth, but as it is receiued into the heart. For thē doth the death of Christ feede vs, when it refresheth vs: then is he eaten, when hee is receiued by faith, and applied too

Nowe if yo
                  •
                desire to knowe the substaunce of that which was geuen in the supper, it was bread and the Sacramente of his body. That which was geuen vppon the crosse, was his body and not a Sacrament. What then wyll you say? was not his body geuen at Supper? Yes in deede Christes body was geuen there too the Disciples: but not for the Disciples bodies,The body of Christe geuen in the Supper but not to mēs bodies, neither yet corporally. neyther after a bodyly &amp; corporal maner for that corporal body was geuen too the Iewes not in the Supper, but on the crosse: whereuppon hee gaue his body corporally not too the Disciples, but for the Disciples. Therefore that which hee gaue for his Disciples was his body: that which hee gaue too his Disciples was the Mystery of his body. Yet was it one and the selfe same body, both that of the Supper geuen to the Disciples:One selfe same body of Christ was geuen in the supper, and vpon the crosse, yet not after the same maner, nor at one time nor to the same persons. and that of the Crosse geuen for his Disciples, but yet not after the same sorte, nor yet at the same tyme. For vppon the Crosse it was geuen too bee slaine corporally: In the Supper it was geuen not to bee sla

Therefore it is not denied that the Lordes body was both geuen and eaten in the Supper: but not the body only, but togeather with the body, the Sacrament annexed also withall: whereof the one apperteyneth too the feeding of the bodies, the other to the fe

               che therefore as these two doe necessarily concurre togeather in the holy Supper, that the one can not bee seuered from the other: Let vs so ioyne the one with the other, that wee ne

               ody of

Christe from the Sacrament, as the Papistes do, which be so throughly wedded to the only substance of the body, as that they leaue therein no substaunce at al of a Sacrament but superficiall and immateriall shadowes, I knowe not what, hanging in the ayre, which serue to no purpose. Neither let vs so segregate the Sacrament againe from the body, as that we leaue nothing in the holy supper but bare signes.
            But in this coupling togeather of the body with the bread in the Sacrament, behooueth to bee well and considerately aduised that wee may throughly perceiue howe these thinges ought to bee ioyned togeather, and howe they ought to be seuered. For neyther that, which affecteth the outwarde senses, and passeth downe into the bodye of man, is the fleshe of Christe: so neither that which is receiued in spirite and in the inwarde man, is bread, but the very body of Christe. Out of the which ariseth a threefolde error of mens corrupt opinions touching  the Sacrament.A threfolde error of men touching the sacrament of the supper. The first errour is, where men do chop and thruste togeather the presence of Christes body in the Sacrament, as that they suppose both the bread and the body to bee deuoured of them with our selfsame mouth corporally, and those wee cal Consubstantiators. The second errour is of suche as bee called Transubstantiators,  which do so altogeather thrust out all substaunce of material bread, or transfourme it into the substaunce of the body, that nothing shall remaine else to bee eaten besides the only fleshe of Christe. The opinion of which sort of people cōmeth to this issue at the last, as that they will admit no corporall presence of any thing in the Sacrament sauing Christe: So that now the Supper must needes bee the very holy thing it self, but no Sacrament of an holy thing: For as muche as to make a Sacramēt to become a Sacrament, two thinges must of fine for
                  •
               e needes concurre: the one whereof must be disposed ou
                  •
               
               wardly,

the other must bee conceaued inwardly: the one must bee an earthly thing, the other heauenly: the one must expresse some what, the other must be expressed by somewhat. The third errour is,  where men so place the Sacramentall bread in the Sacrament as that they leaue nothing there but naked and bare signes, whom the Papists do tearme Figuratiue men and Significatists.
            But wee so ioyne togeather both the sacred bread and Christe himselfe in the holy Supper, that the presence and eating of Christe be spirituall: but the presence and eating of the bread bee corporall: and that this one may bee disgested outwardly by the mouth, and that other conceaued inwardly and, spiritually, in the soule. But heere againe as many times else I doo heare some of our iangling aduersaries whispering against vs. What? say they, did not Christ say, That this was his body? so he said in deede: and what then? Therefore it can not bee, but as Christe spake that it shoulde bee.

But wee confesse both too bee true: namely, that it is the body of Christ: and that withal the bread ceaseth not to be bread: so that neither the wordes of Christ ought to bee discredited, nor the senses deceaued in their plaine beholding of visible things.
            But yee wil saye:An obiectiō out of Ambrose being wrongfully taken. For as much as the power of the heauenly worde is of such efficacy, as that it made Heauen, Earth, the Seas and al that is conteyned in them of nought, howe much more easily shall this woorking worde bee able too chaunge that substaunce of bread which our eyes doo see intoo the body of Christe:The woorking woorde. namely, when as wee doo heare the Lorde himselfe by expresse woordes testifying the same too bee his owne body?

The earth was commaunded to bring foorth her grasse and leafe, that al men might see it. Lastly:The Argument is denyed.

In like manner whereas in the Gospell are many miracles extant wherein appeareth most singular excellency of Christes Godhead, yet in all these did hee woorke no miracle so couertly at any tyme, but hee made it apparauntly manifest too all men.

Ambrose dooth confesse them too bee the things that they were: and will you make vs beleeue that they cease too bee the same which they were? Origen wryting too the same effect:

               The bread, sayth hee, which is sanctified by the word of God, touching the matter and substaunce thereof, goeth downe into the belly, and is throwen out into the draught, &amp;c. If that be bread which after sanctification goeth downe intoo the belly, according too the testimony of Origen, with what face wil Lombarde deny it to bee bread? Againe on the other side if according too Lombardes opinion, there remaine no crumme of substaunce at al, whereof then shall that bee a substaunce which Origen dooth ascribe to the bread. Nowe let the Pope himselfe be vmpier here and iudge whether we ought rather credit Origen or Lombarde.

            I shoulde presse to much vpon you, Lombarde, if I shoulde turne al vpon you that I coulde, out of the auncient recordes of the fathers, which arme in arme as it were bending against you, doo affirme the body of Christ to be in the holy mysteries in such wyse, as that they seclude not meanewhiles bread from it owne substaunce,

but from the common and vsual vse thereof only translate it into an other ende, and supernatural condition by a certain mystical &amp; sacramental meanes: not that it should be no more bread for vs to be eaten: but that it should no bee common, bare and simple bread. That is to say, that it be bread stil, and the same bread also the body of Christ withal: Bread indeed in substaunce, but in the respect of the sacrament, vse, likenesse, aud 
                  
                     Chrysost. ad Caesarium.
                  
                  
                     Before the bread bee sanctified, wee doo cal it bread
                           •
                         But by the sanctification of the diuyne grace, and the prayers of the Priest, it is delyuered from the name of bread: But is reputed woorthy too bee called by the name of the body of Christe, though the nature of bread remayne stil, &amp;c.
                  
                denomination the holy body of Christ.
            Therefore that which wee receaue in our mouth, is natural bread: but in respect of the eating, this nature is not regarded of vs, but raysing our hartes much more high euen intoo heauen, yea vntoo the heauens of heauens as 
                  
                     Chrysost. 1. Cor. hom. 24. Ascende therefore vppe euen too heauen gates, and there enter intoo dewe consideration, nay rather not the gates of Heauen, but of the Heauens of Heauens, and there shalte thou see that whereof wee doo speake.
                  
                  
                     Chrysost. in Genes. Hom. 24. When the eyes of fayth doo beholde these vnspeakeable treasures, they doo not perceaue these visible thinges indeed, but only the difference betwixt these thinges.
                  
                
               Chrysostome reporteth, it doth meditate vpon farre more excellent matter.
            And heereof came it that the auncient wryters did so vsually extol the magnyficence of this sacramente with such excellency in olde tyme. Wherein they w
                  •
               re many tymes rapted intoo such a wonderful vehemency of hyperbolicall speeches, as though the

bread and wine were in very deede matter of nought, and that nothing els should seeme to be made accompt of in the celebration of the supper but the body and blood of the Lord onely: As in very deede these dead elementes be no better worth in respect of the body which they do represent. But what hereof then? Shall the elementes of bread and wyne bee therefore no parte of the sacrament, bicause the consideration of the Lordes body doth possesse the principall partes, and holdeth the whole soule attentiue and faste fixed vpon it? Or shall Christe bee therefore sayde too haue transposed the substance of bread and wine intoo his naturall body really, bicause hee hath chaunged the same intoo the sacrament of his body?
            Or by what argument will our aduersaries make this their assertion iustifiable?There was n
                     •
                   cause why Christ should change the substance of bread into his flesh. For if God and nature do bring to passe, no one thing in the whole frame of creation without great cause. It remaineth that we may bee made acquainted too what ende, for what cause, to what vse or to what purpose, Christe should make this Metamorphosis, That thrusting away bread from out it owne substance, he should deliuer ouer his true &amp; naturall fleshe in deede, but inuisible, to be deuoured carnally, with the carnall mouth of the body, vnder inuisible formes.

                vp in the chief shoppe of Lombards diuinitie. It remaineth hencefoorth that wee searche the very depth of them. And first where as hee reasoneth of the merite of faith,The first reason of Lombard.
                I will not deny but that in matters of fayth mans reason is not of any such capacitie too attayne thereto. For the excellencie of fayth is conuersant in those things properly which the fleshly eyes can not see, or which haue beene knowen by the scriptures to haue beene already past, either which are promised shall come in after time. Moreouer I am not offended with that no lesse auncient then true proposition of Gregorie, where treating of the Lordes entering vnto the disciples, (the gates beeing shut) hee doth deny that faith ought to haue any merite, where mans reason cā make proofe by experience. For we doe confesse and beleeue this to be most true, that which the scriptures haue deliuered touching the gates being shut, and of the Lordes entrie in. But wher did the scriptures at any tyme make neuer so litle a motion of the casting away of bread, of the essentiall presence of Christe vnder empty formes or of transubstantiated elementes? Blessed be they (sayeth Christe) which haue not seene, yet haue beleeued. This is true I confesse: but it followeth not therefore that all thinges which are not seene with the eyes, ought to be beleeued. Neither doe we not therefore relinquishe the reach of mans reason, bicause wee doe not yelde to all maner trifling imaginarie cōceiptes. Whatsoeuer is commaunded by the prescript word of God, the same we do firmely and faithfully beleeue, and thereunto with most forewarde and ready faith do submitte all maner

force of mans reason. But who euer gaue any such commaundement to beleeue that which you haue forged touching that most senselesse absurditie of transubstantiation?In matters of faith mans reasō hath no place Ergo. Transubstantiatiō must be beleeued though it bee quite against reason. the Argument is denied. or by what authorised woorde of scripture at the length will you make iustifiable by writing or by meaning that we ought to adore, though our eyes see not, that your conterfaict person of the sonne of God shapen out of bread and set out to be adored and eaten of vs? Fayth therefore wanteth not her merite, in thinges that ought truly to be beleeued, which by expresse and vndouted au

to procure any mockage? or if hee were willing to hyde his blood vnder a sacramentall forme: aunswere I praye you, what cause was there why the Lorde should vouchsafe the deliuerie thereof by formes, rather then by materiall bread? Besides this as concerning the Paganes, if Christe did feare the scornings of Paganes so much, I desyre Lombard to tell mee thus much againe: If some one Pagane shoulde happen too come nowe into your temples, and beholde your massinges &amp; maskings: what greater occasion can be ministred too mooue them to laughter and skorning, then when hee should see the whole swarme of Papistes in most humble wyse to fall groueling on the grounde, too lifte vp their handes too heauen, and to knocke their breastes at the heauing vp of one poore peece of bread ouer a shauelings head? I beseech you syr: woulde hee not saye that they were all the pack of them starke madde? Nay rather doe not the Iewes, Turkes, and Infidels, dayly saye euen so at this present? And I knowe not whether by any one action more then by this kynde of massing, it is come too passe that the same Iewes, Turkes and Infidelles, taking occasion of offence, do as yet hitherto so obstinately absteyne from the participation of our fayth.
            But wee are choaked here with a very harde boane by the which as through the woordes of Augustine picked out I knowe not from whence,

            I come nowe to the thirde fine reason of Lombard which is alleadged touching the loathing and horrour.The third reason of Lomb. li. 4 dist. 11. cap. 5. For thus he speaketh. And for this cause also, that the stomacke should not abhorre that which the eye did see, bycause wee doe not accustome our selues to deuoure rawe fleshe and blood. Goe to, and what followeth then? therefore bicause it is not lawefull too deuoure Christe with teeth, for this cause his pleasure was too deliuer vnto vs fleshe and blood in a mysterie, &amp;c. I doe perceiue what you speake, Lombard, and allowe thereof: but howe will you nowe agree with your selfe? for you deny it too bee lawefull too deuoure Christe with the teethe: And howe then is hee not deuoured with teethe, if ye establishe an essentiall nature of his body really in the sacrament? you saye that hee deliuered

                  Lombard doth not agree with him selfe. and with all in very deede, to be deuoured and not to be deuoured, with teeth and not with teeth? For if in the Greeke tongue a Mystery is all one in effect as in our language, a sacrament: And if the sacrament bee a signe of an holy thing: nowe he that giueth his body in a mystery, what doth he giue els, then a signe of his body? notwithstanding, I am not ignorant of al these your iuggling and caffling which you frequent about sacramentall signes, vnder the which you mainteine sturdely that the true and vndouted body of Christe, though not apparant to the eyes, yet is conteined and eaten really and substantially by an inuisible meane.

Wherefore this loathesomnes doth not consiste in the rawenes, but in the very humayne fleshe: not in the beholding, but in the nature of the thinge it selfe: not in that which the eye doth beholde, but in that which the heart doth conceyue. For if according too the olde prouerbe,

the wolfe will not deuoure wolues fleshe, nor the dogge dogges fleshe, is there any man beeing of any manly nature that woulde not abhorre to bee fedde with mans fleshe vnder whatsoeuer fourme it were shrowded? or doe ye thinke that Christe did euer conceiue any such matter, as when hee helde the bread in his handes, wherewith he determined to feede his disciples, would therefore exclude bread quyte out of doores, to the ende hee might gorge the mawes of men carnally with his naturall fleshe, beeing both rawe and aliue, contrary to nature, without any necessitie, without all cause, altogether vnprofitable and

            Wherfore you doe not by this meanes exclude lothsomenes from out the sacred mysteries, Lombard, when you turne the fourmes of bread and wyne into the fleshe of Christe: but you choppe a loathsomnes in rather: so that nowe this supper may seeme not honourable but horrible, if so be that excluding bread and wyne this bee true that you speake, that there remayneth nowe nothing to eate but the substaunce of flesh and blood,
                  Lombard is iniurious to the sacrament two maner of waies which substance neuerthelesse ye will not vouchsafe to be seene in it owne kynde, but vnder an other kynde. Wherein ye become two maner of wayes iniurious to the sacrament coupling together therewith a twofolde absurditie. First bicause you defraude the fourmes and accidentes of bread of their true and proper subiect. Secondly, bicause you doe in like maner robbe the very naturall substance of the body of his proper accidentes, so that nowe there remayneth neither any substaunce of bread at all, nor any fourme of a body: on this wyse the Poetes (as it seemeth) were wonte to describe their Chymeres.
            Neuerthelesse this is not spokē to that end, as though we would banishe Christe cleane out of the sacrament, or that we might seclude our selues from partaking with

            All which beeing thus concluded vpon, as appeareth by plaine demonstration before: all that your lying and false assertion infringible, as you tearme it, is become windshaken altogither, wherewith you mainteyne so stoute a combate for the kingdome of accidentes, and your transubstantiation, as that yee leaue no place nor space for breade and wine in the Sacrament, but calling all backe to visible fourmes, plant all your whole batterie of the materiall part of the Sacrament vpon these buttresses of shadowes onely.Transubstantiation of the doctrine of sacramentall formes in the Lordes supper is described. Which fourmes though retaine still the names of the things, which they were before, yet doe ye denie them to be the very thinges themselues. Wherevpon if at any time the names of breade and wine doe occurre in the holy Fathers of the Church, the same ye teache to be vnderstoode on this wise. To witte, that they bee called breade and wine, not in respect that they be so, but bycause they were once so: and that the very substance thereof is gone farre away, and that therein is nought resiant nowe that is elemental, besides the onely names of elementes, and emptie fourmes onely of breade and wine, the names whereof they doe reteyne still, but haue vtterly lost the verie substaunces themselues: and do conteyne nought else now besides the naturall and substanciall bodie of Christ, by the which bodie neither bee the fourmes affected, nor doth the bodie affect the fourmes.

               The bodie of Christ, sayth he, that is receiued of the altar, is a figure whiles the bread &amp; wine are apparantly seene with eyes: but it is the very body, when the inward fayth apprehendeth it for the bodie and blood of Christ. &amp;c.

Surely that queysie stomacke of yours deserueth in my conceyte to bee continually fed with those delicate cates of accidents.
            But bycause I will not oppresse you with testimonies I surcease here. This one thing I demaund: sithence these visible kindes whereof ye speake, doe holde yet the names of the things which they were before: I woulde faine know, whether togither with the names they do retaine the effect and operation of the same things wherein they be sayd to feed, and to nourish, yea or nay?Whether the operation of bread remaine in the Sacrament togither with the kindes and names of bread, yea or nay. If ye say, yea: certes ye feed your guestes very finely, that so feede them with colours and shewes of accidents not much vnlike, as if bycause Pepper is black, therfore a man should say it is hote in the mouth: or bycause salt is white, therefore it doth sauour and season victuals.
            But if ye say, nay, what consonancie of likenesse shal there bee betwixt the Lordes flesh and this Sacrament, which you fasten wholy to shadowes: seing that shadowes haue no force at al to refresh, &amp; withal seeing ye leaue vs no substaunce of breade wherevpon wee may feede? For what shall we say?No likenesse betwixt the accidents and the body of Christ. doeth not the fleshe of Christ nourish the inwarde man no more substancially, then the outward formes of bread and wine doe nourish the bodie? Surely yee haue discouered vs verie daintie delicates, whereby the bodie is neither fedde, nor soule refreshed. For whether the inwarde soule doe receyue no more

comfort of the fleshe of Christ, then our outwarde bodies nourishmēt of visible formes, I leaue to other mens iudgement, how wel we are like to be fed.

In the seconde place nowe steppeth forth an other as farre fetched a riddle conned out of the braine panne of Sphynx her selfe verie deepe and daungerous to bee assoyled.What thing is that thing of the Sacramēt, and the Sacramēt of a thing, and howe it is both according to Lombard.
                Namely, what thing that may bee, that is both the thing, and withal the Sacrament also. If thou canst not vndo this tarring yron, gentle reader (for I know thou art not able of thy selfe to attaine to it) this deepe riddlemaster wil discouer it vnto thee. For he wil tel thee that it is the fleshe of Christe, which being both a substance in respect of the visible forme of bread, vnder the which it is conteined and signified, is also the Sacrament of the mystical body, in as much as it signifieth the mystical vnitie of the Church forsoath, and representeth the expresse ymage thereof. O marueylous nimble witte, fined in the verie bottome of all Lombardie. But from whence is this expresse ymage of this Sacrament deriued, whereof Lombarde maketh mention? Forsooth out of S.

               The Church, sayeth he, is called one bread and one bodie. For this cause, That as one loafe of breade is made of many graynes, and as one bodie is made of many members: so the Church is vnited and knit togither of manie faythfull through the coupling or mutual knot of loue. As concerning S. Paul, the whole and natural deriuation of this similitude is deriued not from the bodie of Christ
                  •
                but from the bread onely. Nowe to admitte this to bee true, that there is no small resemblance betwixt the true bodie and mystical bodie of Christ: yet doth not euerie similitude make a Sacrament, though euerie Sacrament doe conteine some certaine similitude. But from whence hath Lombarde pyked out this that he teacheth, that the true natural bodie of Christ shoulde bee the Sacrament of his mysticall bodie? Is it bycause it doeth set foorth the likenesse thereof? But there be many things in the frame of creation, that resemble eche other, yet bee they not Sacraments. If no Sacraments ought be receyued into the Church, but such as the Lorde himselfe hath instituted, let Lombarde tel vs, where the Lord did euer institute or deliuer his natural bodie to bee a Sacrament of his mysticall bodie. Moreouer, when hee hath shewed it, howe shall hee honestly auoyde as great an absurditie, to witte, to clogge the Church with eight Sacraments of verie necessitie?Eight Sacraments hatcht out of Lombards diuinitie. For if the Church bee possessed of sixe Sacramentes, besides the Sacrament of Eucharist, and that out of the same Sacrament of Eucharist also two other Sacraments doe spring vp: the one whereof must bee a visible forme conteyning and signifying both the true and mysticall bodie of Christ: the other muste bee the verie naturall bodie, which must beare the expresse ymage of his mysticall bodie: then muste it needes followe, that by this meanes the Churche shall bee enlarged with eight Sacraments.
            
               
               The thing, and not a Sacrament.In the thirde place commeth in nowe to entreate of an other speciall note of that which is the thing and no Sacrament. Wherin to admit likewise that which Lombard disputeth of the mystical vnitie of the Church, and of the many members of one bodie: yet doth not this vnitie belong any thing at al to the thing of the Sacrament. Neither was this supper ordeyned to any such end, that it should note vnto vs the vnitie of the mysticall bodie, but that it should be a memorial of the natural body that was deliuered to death on the crosse for our sakes. Which the Lord himselfe doth verifie to be true in most plaine and euident speeches:The substance of the Sacrament is not the vnitie of the mysticall body, but the death of his naturall bodie. 
               Take ye, sayth he, Eate ye: this is my body that shalbe deliuered for you. Therefore the very material substance of this Sacrament is not the church, but the natural bodie crucifi

Paul doth apply this mystical vnion not to Christs bodie which was crucified for vs, but vnto the elements of bread and wine. We bee many one bread, sayth he, and one bodie. As much to say, One loafe many graines: one Church many members. Which similitude of the Apostles, if must be so necessarily combined to the sacramentall bread, as Lombard himself doth affirme, what conueniencie wil here be of a similitude betwixt graines of bread, and the members of the Church, if this Papists brood wil vouchsafe vs in the Sacrament neither bread, no not so much as one graine of bread?

Thirdly, where as hee maketh the selfe same vnion of the Churche suche a thing, as shoulde bee answerable to both Sacramentall signes as the proper correlatiue of both signes. Whiche of all other cannot possibly be: for as much as to haue a double correlatiue answerable to one only Relatiue is a most grosse absurditie.

            Which being a matter horrible to be vttered, yet this doeth so muche the more aggrauate the horror, that these

choppers and chaungers doe so chaunge the substaunce and naturall vigour of the Sacrament, which ought be ascribed properly to the Lordes death and passion, from the power of Christes passion, to Christes vnion: from the body of Gods owne sonne, to the Church: as thoug

For when the Lorde did commaunde to take and eate, he doeth not say, this is my mysticall body, that shal fructifie and encrease out of many members of the Church: But this is my body, that shalbe geuen for you. Whereupon if I might now argue in the schooles of Diuines, I would on this wise proceede against mine aduersaries.

               For the Lorde in the chaunge of his countenance seemed vnto them to bee halfe frantike, when he spake of eating his fleshe: therefore they supposed that the Lorde seemed besides himselfe, knowing not what he spake and as it were halfe mad. But he seemed so to be vnto Achis the king, that is to say, to fooles, and to ignorant men: and therefore hee forsooke them and went his way: or rather they forsooke him, because this speache seemed very hard vnto them: when as notwithstanding the speach was not hard, but they rather hard &amp; dul of vnderstanding, not the speache.

As though hee had saide according to the interpretation of Augustine, Understande yee my wordes which I haue spoken spiritually. This body which you see, shall yee not eate, nor drinke that blood, which the Iewes shall shed out of my side I haue deliuered you a certaine Sacrament, the same being spiritually vnderstood wil quickē you.

            I haue hitherto nowe manifested a cause sufficient enough, except I be deceiued, that moued our Lorde to institute this sacrament of his body and blood in bread and wyne: Namely, to represent the power and efficacie of his most ghostly and comfortable death, not onely to our faith and remembrance, but to our senses also by a most apte similitude. Which similitude beeing not able to be made consonant by any meanes without bread and wyne: hereof therefore commeth it to passe, that reteining bread, we doe admitte here a necessarie figuratiue speeche:A figuratiue speeche necessary in the Lordes supper. whereby wee doe most truely call bread by the name of Christes body, and the body of Christe by the name of the bread of life. For if it might bee lawefull for Lombard too vse this kynde of speeche, In

And again in the same place, The breaking and portions are made in the sacrament, that is to say, in the visible form, Lōbard And in the same place. * Where part of the body is, there is the whole. &amp;c. But Augustine sayeth otherwise in his 57. epistle. Euery greatnes is lesse in the part, then in the whole.

forme, that is to say, the bread doth signifie the body of Christe.
            It remaineth now that you (holy father) with your cowled cloysterers render vs a cause likewise, why yee driue the bread out of the sacrament like a runneaway. Why in this case you will not admitte a figure in any case.The cause is sifted out wh the Lord in his supper did institute a sacramēt of his body For this is your doctrine, that in the sacrament no bread is eaten, but the very body of Christe simply, naturally, and really. Go to, what was the cause at the length why the Lorde him selfe should either deliuer vnto his guestes his owne naturall fleshe to be deuoured, or why doe ye suppose that we ought to beleeue the same to bee true? you will aunswere, that hee did it to the ende hee might feede our frayle, weake, and vncleane fleshe with his most holy fleshe. Of the very same opinion were the Capernaites wandring in the same mismaze long before your dayes: and being offended as Cyrill reporteth with the wordes of the Lord,

Uerily, if he gaue a signe of his body, he could not choose but giue somewhat wherein hee might signifie his body, although there bee no woorde significant expressed. In like maner neither was any woorde significant vttered by the Apostle when hee spake of the Rocke,
                  August. de Ciuitate Dei. lib. 18. Cap. 48. Bicause after a certen maner all thinges significant doe beare the names of the thinges signified. As this speech of the Apostle, the rocke was Christe, when as notwithstanding it did signifie Christe.
                as the same Augustine witnesseth: for the Apostle sayed not, the rocke did signifie Christ, but the rock was Christ, when as neuerthelesse no man ought to doute of the Apostles meaning herein, not that Christe was a very rocke or stone in deede, but that the rocke did signifie Christ. Or if these iolly fellowes will not bee satisfied with this aunswere of Augustine, then let Ambrose aunswere for Augustine: Who setting downe the matter playnely by the woorde of signifying: Bicause, saith he, we be deliuered by the death of the Lorde, beeing myndefull hereof we doe in eating and drinking signifie

the flesh and blood, which was crucified for vs.
            But if all the speeches which Christe vsed (which are euery where very plentifull in figures and parables) must bee leueled according too this playne rule of the letter, then let vs in our entry at the Church doore, worship the doore, bicause in like vtterance of speeche the Lorde sayde: I am the doore, if any man doe enter by me &amp;c. Where appeareth no sounde of any woorde of signifying, whereby he might manifest vnto vs that he was not a doore in deede, but did signifie a doore. But in this place I see you forsake your grammer construction, and shrowde your selues vnder a figure, and not without cause. And what scrupule is it, I praye you that may let vs to vse a figuratiue speeche as wel here where he saith. This is my body? Or why shoulde you bee more squemishe at a figuratiue speeche where we are saide to eate Christe, then where we are commanded by the scriptures to put on Christe? Paul doth instruct the Galathians on this wise.

            But I vnderstande what scrupule this is that so much altereth your diet. It is bicause in the woordes of the supper a certen speciall commaundement is set downe by Christe, whereby wee be commaunded to doe this in remembraunce of him. Goe to, and doth this seeme cause sufficient enough, why reiecting the figure, you shoulde runne awaye from heauenly diuinitie,

May I be so bold (holy father) to demaund of you, when the blessed virgin is commaunded to take the disciple of Christe for her sonne (as is before mentioned) shall wee therefore take him for her naturall sonne borne of her body? Men are counsayled too gelde them selues for the kingdome of God: what shall wee therefore followe the fonde example of Origen in the carnall construction of the letter?

               Of which matter let vs once againe heare what Augustine saieth. Do not dout (sayeth hee) that the man Christe is there nowe, from whence hee shall come agayne: imprinte in thy minde and beleeue stedfastly the Christian faith, that hee is risen agayne from the dead, ascended into heauen, sitteth at the right hand of his father, and shall come from thence, not from any where els, too iudge the quicke and the dead in the very same forme and substance of body, too the which hee hath giuen immortalitie, and from the which he hath not taken nature awaye. According to this nature, he is not to be imagined to bee dispersed euery where. For we must be very circumspect herein, least we do establishe the diuinitie of his manhood, that wee vtterly take away the truthe of his body. For it is no good argument to saye, that as in the nature of the Godhead, hee is euery where as God: likewise we haue our beeing, our life, &amp; our mouing in him, yet are not we therefore euery where as he is: for he is after one sorte a man in the godhead, and after an other sorte a God in the manhoode, after a certen peculiar proper &amp; singular maner. For this one person is both God and man: and they both one only Christ Iesus in al places, as he is God

For as his most blessed mother hauing deliuered Christe out of her wombe, is sayde properly and truely too haue brought foorth the very natural body of Christe naturally,Christ is otherwise borne into the world, otherwyse eaten in the world. not the sacrament of his body: euen so likewyse this holy sacrament of Christes body, which is produced and made by the only woorde of GOD without mother at al, is called a body by a spiritual construction onely, but can not rightely bee called the substantial and natural body which issued foorth of the virgin, and in the natural sense therof. For although Christ be one and the selfsame in person wheresoeuer hee bee, yet is hee not euery where

according to the natural substaunce, which he receiued of his mother, neither is he eaten as he was borne, for hee was borne a natural man in deede, but hee is eaten not otherwyse then by a mystery significant. In mysteries similitudes of thinges are conteined, but not the substaūce themselues properly. In the mother the woorde was made fleshe: In the Euchariste the flesh of the woorde is made our foode, I say our foode,

               etermine the channge too bee therefore made, because it coulde bee made? After the fame maner was the olde Heretique Praxeas wont to frame his argumentes in olde tyme, whome Tertullian answeryng not vnaptly:
                  Tertullian aduersus Praxeam. If we vse these presumptions so disorderly in our talking, wee maye imagine what wee liste of GOD as though hee did it because hee was able too doe it. But wee may not therefore beleeue that hee did all thynges because hee was able too doe all thinges, but wee muste enquire whether hee did it or no.
                but after this manner (quoth Tertullian) may any man imagine what he list concerning God, as though hee did it in deede, because hee was able too doe it. Therfore if these Romanistes woulde frame theyr Argumentes lyke good Logicians, they must deduce the conclusion, not from that which GOD was able too doo, but from that whiche hee willed too bee doone. For the power of GOD, is his will: and not too bee of power in GOD, is not too will: for whatsoeuer hee willed, the same also was hee able too doe, and dyd it in deede.
            We doe not therfore extenuate heere the singuler and incomprehensible power of Christ in working myracles: so also neither are myracles to be newe coyned where no myracles bee nowe: Forasmuche as myracles are wrought not for the behoofe of the beleeuing persons properly, but in respecte of the vnbeleeuers, nor are at any time vsually frequented, but for some great and vrgent causes, or some notable necessitie, too strike a

terror into the heartes of the beholders, whom a man is willing to winne to the faith: I woulde very faine learne then of these men, what cause or commoditie may be alledged in this Action, why the Lorde sitting with his Apostles shoulde by the Omnipotencie of his power transpose the substaunce of bread intoo the substaunce of his owne fleshe too bee eaten. Namely, sithens neither the Apostles did neede any suche myracle, being already before established in faith: yea though they had needed it, yet did the Lorde very grauely forewarne them, that his fleshe shoulde not profite them any whit at all? Moreouer neyther was any of them carried into any amazed admiration, or straunge adoration of any thing doone by the Lord in that Supper. Besides this also neither do any of ye Euangelistes make report of any myracle wrought heere, but doe describe the maner and story of the action simply, without al astonishment of the beholders. And by what faith I praye you may wee conceaue in our mindes a myracle of hidden transubstantiation, where no thing appeareth too any mans sight that we may wonder at, where no degree of a myracle may eyther appeare to the senses, or bee comprehended by reason? But you wyll say, that the senses may not be credited heere: bee it so: so neither may no credite bee geuen too euery drowsie dreame of euery doting Dotterel: but our imaginations must be guided by the right line of Gods worde. And in this same very woorde of God, if any thing occurre eyther figuratiuely or doubtfully spoken, as the naturall propertie of the very speaches them selues is alwayes too bee obserued, so that construction of woordes is to be shunned of all others chiefly, which is preiudiciall too the sinceritie of the whole Scriptures, and which throweth men downe headlong into open &amp; horrible impietie. And what can be more horribly wicked, then to destroy

the true and naturall humanitie of Christe, and too drawe Christe himself maugre his head into blemish of offence?

And by the same reason shall the trueth of the Scripture lye, which hath made no difference betwixt the humanitie of Christe and our humanitie in the thinges whiche properly apperteine too the properties of

               ough wee eate thereof with our mouthes a thousande times: whereof the Lord himselfe meaning to aduertise the Capernaites not altogether obscurely, who did wrest these wordes to the carnall and fleshly sense and meaning of eating, saide vnto them these wordes:
                  Iohn .6. 
               My woordes are spirite and life. The fleshe doeth not profite at all.

                     •
                  tood.Which wordes doe tende too this construction at the last: You doe conceiue of these woordes which I spake touching the eating of my fleshe too too grossely and carnally, and farre otherwise then my meaning is: for I did neither speake them in any suche sense, as that I would inuite you to the deuouring of my person: for what can bee more absurde? Neither did I take vppon mee this fleshe too any suche ende, as too fill your throates and belies therewith: For what commoditie shoulde thereby redownde vnto you? that was not my meaning, but too the ende I shoulde geue the same to bee slaine for your sakes: which slaughter of my fleshe beyng apprehended of you spiritually by faith, and inwardly disgested within your heartes, shall refreshe you much more effectually, then Moyses refreshed your bellies with his Manna: for it shall reuiue you with a liuely life, not perishable and temporall, but eternall: and it shall satisfie your hunger, not that hunger which will bee hungry again, but which shall replenish you being full fed with euerlasting felicitie in such wise as that you shal from thence foorth neuer bee hungry any more. Whereupon those his woordes are not without cause called spirite and life, not wherewith

he turned bread into fleshe, but where
                  •
               ith he represented the efficacie of his fleshe which was slaine for vs, and of his blood which was shedde for vs, vnder the mysteries of bread and wine: And on this wise in deede the fleshe of Christ, not in that sense as it is eaten, but in that whereby our faith is reposed in him, is become altogi

                  •
               exe one thing more. Whervnto I woulde verie faine heare what aunswere these Laterane breade flesh makers will make: who thinke it not sufficient to turne breade and wine into a Sacrament of the bodie and blood by the diuine power of the woorde, vnlesse by a certaine kinde of Alcumie they poure foorth substaunce of things from out one substance into an other,The Popish Alcumie. and so produce out of the substaunce of breade and wine, a certaine contrarie nature of mans flesh and blood, and make thereof some certaine quinte essence. And goe to nowe, to yeelde thus much to their Alcumistical chaunge, to wit, that nothing remayneth in the Sacrament besides the onely substaunce of the bodie and blood: I come nowe not to enquire in what mynute of time, in what instant of pronouncing the woorde this transubstantiation taketh his first commencement of being created: For the Popes themselues cannot yet agree vpon this poynt. This thing do I demaund. After that this same bodie of our Lorde being once deuoured by vs,Uerie grosse enormities and ab

               able restoratiue. You haue forced the afflicted estate of tormented Christians

to such a lamentable extremitie with your horrible crampes and execrable crueltie, that you are not now any more to be confuted with arguments as an heretique, but as Antichrist himselfe the most butcherly bloodsucker of Christians, to be abhorred and accursed with the general detestation of all the godly: insomuch that whatsoeuer person be not from the bottom of his heart, your professed enemie, can in no wise bee in league with the glorie of Iesus Christ.
            For as much therefore as the matter is come to this passe:An exhortation to the Pope. and that your tottering state standeth in worse case nowe than any man can expresse: what better prouision may you make for your selfe, or what more wholesome counsel may I giue vnto you, then that ye reclaime your selfe speedily, and returne againe betimes? Whither shal I returne, wil you say? Returne, Romane ruffler, from whence you are fallen. Returne to humilitie, to the which you bee called. Returne againe vnto the charge wherevnto you are appoynted. If the Lorde haue called you into his Uineyarde, hee hath called you to toyle and labour, not to scrape riches togither: to ministerie and submission, not to maistrie and soueraintie. Bestowe cost, and dresse the Lordes vineyarde therefore, doe not spoyle and moyle the Uineyarde. For it is no Uineyarde of yours, which though were your owne, yet ought you not roote and turne it vp with such boarishe sauagenesse. For it is the Lordes Uineyarde and not yours: Who if haue waged you amongest other his woorkemen, returne therefore to your worke, and holde you contented with your place, and vaunte not your Peacockes taile more than becommeth your plumes: and be satisfied with your penie, whether you come in the first houre, or the last houre of the day: one kinde of payment is due to euerie woorkeman alike. There is no prerogatiue amongest woorkemen. The Lordes benignity

is extended to al alike. Therfore if you be wise, let your Romain Sea content you, bicause you are placed in Rome: and permit others that be ouerseers ouer others, to gouerne their owne prouinces. And would God the Lorde woulde once vouchsafe imprint such an heart in you, as might earnestly &amp; seriously ponder these things, and that you might returne from whence you are fallen. The time was when this your Citie of Rome was famous and noble, replenished with most woorthy woorshippers of Christ: adorned with excellent wittes and most commendable conuersation of life: notably magnified with the blood of glorious martyrs: most aboundantly flourishing with godly and learned Bishops: who employed all their industrie and endeuour to none other ende, then to the publique peace and tranquilitie of the Church.
            Restore againe this peace vnto vs (holy father) if you may, and this you may easily doe, if yee wil depart from that proude primacie, which you nowe stande vpon altogether agaynst all Gods lawe, agaynst all mans lawe, and quite contrarie to the example of all the auncient fathers. Lay downe that peruerse imperious obstinacie: vaile lowe your stately topgallant, and shake off that vnweldie clogge of Lordlinesse, which you haue vndertaken, the weight whereof is able to ouerpeyse, I say not your shoulders, but the strongest shoulders of the stoutest man in the worlde. Let errours giue place to truth. Let humaine glorie assubiect it selfe to the glorie of Christ. Let the Romishe Broker call backe againe his Romish counterfeyt trash, which he hath foysted into the Church without any warrant of the Scriptures, I meane Masses, Sacrifices, Satisfactions, Pylgrimages, Image-worshippers, false doctrine: Monkish vowes, Purgatorie merits, Routes of Regulars, combersome clogges of consciences.

Examples bee extant euerie where, whiche may endure you to bee better resolued. Whether you enter into dewe consideration of the life of Christ, what can bee more milde? or whether yee beholde the platte formes and proceedings of the Apostles, what can bee more contrarie? more repugnant? and more vnlike the course of your Court? Let vs come one degree lower to the next succeeding age after the Apostles, what shall a man finde in those graue fathers of the Primitiue church, that is not altogither discrepant to these your outragies and disorders? But to make no long rehearsal, we will for examples sake, put you in remembrance of one man alone, a verie godly person, namely, that notable ornament of the Church Cyprian, whom I thought good to vouch by name at this present, not so much bycause you should read his wordes,
                  Cyprian writing to Iubaianus of the baptisme of Heretiques. as that by him you might learne the maner of the auncient discipline, and the most excellent integritie of that age.

For neyther hath any of vs taken vppon him too bee a Bishoppe ouer Bishoppes, nor hath enforced any of our fellowe Bishoppes too any necessitie of obedience by any tyrannous constraint for as much as euery bishoppe is endued with his proper peculiar iudgement according too the freedome of his owne liberty and power, as that hee may not bee iudged of an other, howe then may him selfe iudge any other person.

But these thicke clowdes cease not as yet too threaten dayly farre more daungerous tempestes: and from whence they proceede, I know not, except they grow frō out these stinking bogges of that Romishe ryot onely, and those pestilent

Wherefore I hū

heere on earth, bee yee careful againe and againe, that the fraudulent practises of the enemies preuaile not more then your power and authority. You can by no meanes forget the treacherous troubles wherewith this Calidon boare hath moiled your nations, with what an vnmerciful slaughter. with what a monstruous butchery hee hath deuoured the seely flocke of the Lorde these many yeeres now, with howe incredible calamity hee hath oppressed your sobiectes, and howe horribly iniuriouse hee hath behaued himself against your own persons, states, &amp; seignories. For amongst the whole order of your puissant estate, what one Prince hath beene of long tyme nowe so mighty in power, in whose kingdomes the Popes practises coulde not preuaile further then your renowme &amp; authority,The Popes power ouer princes against al equitie and right. in the which hee hath not deuoured more of your owne subiectes with faggot and tortures, then any of you durst preserue from his tyranny? In the which hee hath not enioyed more friendly hartes &amp; more faithful subiects then you your selues haue? but why doo I speake heere of your subiects, whenas I do see none more humble and obedient vassalles vnto him, then your selues? For when you punish them, whome he commaundes you to punishe: when you committe to fire &amp; flame at his commaundemēt and lust, whome hee condemneth too the stake: when you do more eagerly and more straightly exequute the lawes of his inquisition more then your owne lawes: when yee bid battel to your owne subiects without any cause, without any their fault, or misdemeanor by the only iustigation and procurement of the Pope, seeking the sackes and blood of your friēds, for your deadly enemies sake, herein what seeme you els then bondslaues too him, whose souereignes and Lords behoued you to be?
            Which albeit may seeme it selfe matter most detestable and most vnwoorthy your excellent renowme, yet I wil not much impute the same too any your cowardyse,

as to your tymorousnes, rather ne yet so much to your tymorousnes, as too the general ignoraunce of those barbarous tymes. For I do knowe by what crampes and pernicious practizes they crept into the hartes of princes at the first: Namely, vnder the beautiful countenaunce of the Churche, with a false vysor of religion by crooked conueyances wrything and wresting the testimonies of holy scripture hither and thither: with which bugbeares blazing Gorgones head as it were, they had so vndermyned al the most mighty potentates of the worlde, that they might easily induce them to beleeue that all thinges were well and godly atchieued, whatsoeuer were vndertaken by the commaundementes of those holy fathers, which coulde not erre by any meanes possible. And euen heerehence loe stepte foorth vppon the stage the first prolocutor of al this whole tragedy. But this present age no we requireth other maners: Neither coulde the olde prouerbe bee more truely verified at any tyme so much as nowe, to witte Truth is the daughter of time. For what so cloudy ignorance can possibly ouerwhelme the senses of any sensible man so much as that in this so manifest a sunneshyne of Euangelical glory, hee can not easily conceaue by ymagination, that this ecclesiasticall monarchie of the seruauntes of Christ was neuer erected by Christ the founder thereof, ne yet euer at any time permitted of him, but many tymes forbidden, &amp; most grieuously rebuked euery where.

But nowe sithence it hath pleased the heauenly maiesty too vouchsafe those same princes, whome hee hath called intoo his Churche, too become Christians, as the which doo no lesse dutyfully mynister vnto Christe, then the Bishoppes them selues: I see no cause too the contrary why the same Christian princes which beare soueraignty in states politique, shoulde not also beare souereignty in the congregation of Christians. So that there may seeme no cause to remayne nowe why this pontificall monarchy shoulde so presumptuously vsurpe any such prerogatiue in any their dominions, that ought not to become subiect to the laweful Magistrates in euery of their seueral prouinces.

That which nowe remayneth to bee spoken, I wil turne too the residewe of the people of Christendome as many as be brethren and ioynt Cytiziens with me, coupled togither in one and the selfe same fellowship of Baptisme al and euery of whome I doo likewyse pray and beseeche that they take heede againe and againe, that they suffer not themselues too bee haled backwarde from the truthe by any suttle, slye, inveigling nor any gloriouse tytle of names bee they neuer so plausible.

Which order if we shalbe enforced to obserue, to wit, that wee accept of nothing to bee safe and sounde in matters of religion, but that which hath beene priuiledged by custome of elder yeeres after this rule, surely neither Paul nor Peter, neither any one of the Apostles at all, should euer haue beene a Christian, neither shall any the Turkes hereafter bee conuerted into our faith, being so many yeeres enured &amp; nooseled vp in their owne errors.
            Go to nowe, I woulde faine learne of these felowes that doo so stoutly stande vpon the imitation of their forefathers,Customes of time and imitation of forefathers is neither to be allowed of al, nor in any respect, nor yet in al things. what aunswere they will yelde touching Antichriste: whether he is yet to come, or when hee commeth, where they will saye his kingdome shall bee planted? If they will affirme that it shall bee in the Churche: what seasons of that churche whyles Antichrist beareth swaye, will they describe vnto mee, whether it shalbe the churche of truthe or of errour? And howe can it otherwyse bee, but that as long as Antichrist reigneth and possesseth the heartes of men, the truth must bee suppressed for a season, and errour must possesse the greater part of the churche. And where will these men place the churche of Christ then? Whether mounted aloft vpon the toppe of a hill, which shalbe famous and glorious in all mens eyes? or shrowding close in some corner rather: when as persecution surrounding al places with horror, the woman cloathed with the sunne shalbe faine to flee into the wildernes: when the saintes must be ouercome: when the strumpet being drunken with the blood of the saintes shall triumphe in her maiestie: where shall nowe become

this publique, I saye, this publique euerlasting victory of truth, which many persuade them selues to enioy in the church? What shall become of that churche which can not erre, when the sainctes shalbe slayne in the churche? when that false Prophet shall rule the roste euery where? when he shall defyle all places with the blood of the holy ones? when as also the very elect shall be in great hasard to be seduced? finally when as so merciles a gulf shall swallowe vp the godly, that the very horrour of the perill shall procure the ende of all euils long before the determined tyme? when as the childe of perdition shall be shryned in the temple of the Lorde? all which if we see plainely accomplished alr

For if within these fewe yeeres, synce the tyme that Crosses were fastened first vppon the garmentes of Christians, namely in the tyme of Maximilian the Emperour, so incredible hauocke hath beene made of Christian martyrs, by the onely butchery of the Pope of Rome, as is skarse credible too bee beleeued: Certes if soo many thousandes of Christians haue beene swallowed vpp and deuoured with soo manye, and soo monstruouse tortures heretofore

               dge of the truth is supported by great abundance of supply and helpe. For albeit your forefathers did erre in olde time, yet is their excuse more colourable then yours: If they, being at any time carried away by suttle practises of their Popes, were affectionated to fables, according to the barbarous grossenesse of those dayes, either bicause they were not instructed more soundly, or bicause those helpes and aydes of bookes and good literature, was not as yet extant from out the Printers shoppes, or els bicause that childe of perdition was not yet reuealed: this may be lesse cause to maruell of your forefathers ignorance: yet them selues also bee in that respect somewhat the more pardonable.

            Therefore we may not respect what hath vsually byn accustomed, but what ought to bee done: not what hath beene done of olde, but what is well done.

And therefore Augustine saied very wel, namely, that in the stablishing of faith and authoritie of doctrine in the churche ought no accompt to bee made what men saye, but what the Lorde him selfe onely sayeth in his worde. Which when Ambrose likewise agreeing, calleth all thinges

               newe, whatsoeuer the Lorde Christ hath not taught, and affirmeth that the same ought of right to bee condemned, bicause, sayeth he, Christe is the waye to the faithfull. Whereupon Cyprian doth admonish not vnfitly: Let vs not regard what any of our forefathers thought good to do before time, but what Christ hath done first, who is before and aboue all others.

            But bicause here commeth place to treate of antiquitie, vpon the which the Romish religiō doth vaunt it selfe so gloriously, let these honest men therefore bring foorth their bookes, that they may by good proofe iustifie once at the length in deede y• which they magnifie so mightily in wordes. For I do heare what they braye abroade with open mouthes, to wit, that the boundes prefixed by our forefathers in olde time ought not be remoued: and that their church is such a one, as beeing established by the space of many yeeres now, by anciēt custome of the forefathers,

by allowed authoritie of continuall custome and consent of most auncient fathers, euen from the first beginning of the primitiue churche, hath euer hitherto enioyed vndiscontinued possession. Go to, and what fathers be they a Gods name, whose boundes they

Surely if vnder the name of fathers they meane these first fathers the Prophetes, Christ him selfe, &amp; the Apostles: we do reteine the same their boūdes inuiolable as well as they: if they vnderstand the order of fathers next vnto them,The Papane Monarchie hath no maner war

You do vnderstand, if you wil make a iust cōputation of the yeeres, what

You doe see how wickedly and treacherously the Pope of Rome &amp; his deere dearlinges the Cardinalles, haue not only raked vp that kingdome, which they doe most iniuriously deteigne, but also to what end and with what affection they maintein the same at this present, not that truth may raigne, but that true religion may be brought to nought.

If this could be obteyned of them with their good willes, nothing could be more honourable: But for as much as we may not so much as hope for any such thing at their handes: the remedy hereof reboundeth back vnto you, chiefly and aboue others to you that are princes, that euery of you according to your auncient generositie, authoritie, and pietie, doe first pacifie this troubled estate of religion within your owne dominions, restore that which is crazed and ruinous, and reforme that which is defiled and corrupte. Next it toucheth you that be Bishops and Pastours, that euery of you direct your particular flock carefully, soundly, and godly towardes the kingdome of God. Last of all, it concerneth you that be subiectes, that euery of you doe dutifully acknowledge your humble obedience to your owne Princes and Magistrates in the Lorde.
            Heere then you see that you be forewarned and admonished, who neuerthelesse for your singular and most excellent wisdomes neede not any our admonition. Therefore I make an ende here, both of speaking and admonishing: if I may be so bolde to adde hereto this our protestation. If any man be able to produce one word so much

out of the authoritie Euangelicall, whereby the Lorde Iesus did yelde any maner of soueraintie or preeminence to his disciples, I do not gainsay, but they may yelde thē selu

               s to the Popes authoritie whosoeuer will. But if there be nothing in the whole scriptures, that the Lorde him selfe doth either more carefully aduise, or more earnestly forbidde, then that any of his disciples by seeking any preeminence at all, should raise him selfe aboue any his fellowes, restraining thē by all maner of meanes frō all maner of superioritie whatsoeuer, prouoking them to the humble example of his owne humilitie: Do you then deliberatly and maturely determine in your heartes now whether you will rather march vnder the standard of the Lambe him selfe, your grand captaine to the goale of euerlasting felicitie, or receiuing the marke of the beast, throwe your selues headlong into vnrecouerable perdition together with this most arrogant popish Prelate. The Lord Iesus, euen the same supercelestiall peacemaker of heauen and earth, enspire your hearts and mindes with the spirite of his grace in the things that belong to his peace, vnto the glory of his name &amp; the preseruation of his church: the same Lorde Iesus also encrease your honourable estates, and preserue you in all the waye of truth for euer and euer. Amen.
