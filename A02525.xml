            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To
THE HIGH AND
MIGHTY PRINCE
HENRY Prince of WALES,
his Highneſſes vnworthy ſeruant
dedicates all his labours, and
wiſhes all happineſſe.
            
               Moſt gracious Prince,
            
            
               THis worke of mine,
which (if my hopes
and deſires faile
me not) time may
heereafter make great, I

haue preſumed both to dedicate
in whole to your Highneſſe,
and to parcell out in
ſeuerals vnto ſubordinate
hands. It is no maruell if
Bookes haue this freedome,
when wee our ſelues can and
ought to be all yours, while
wee are our owne, and others
vnder you. I dare
ſay, theſe Meditations,
how rude ſoeuer they may
fall from my pen, in regard
of their ſubiect are fit for a
Prince. Heere your Highneſſe
ſhall ſee how the great
patterne of Princes, the

King of Heauen, hath euer
ruled the World, how his
ſubſtitutes, earthly Kings,
haue ruled it vnder him,
and with what ſucceſſe either
of glorie, or ruine. Both
your peace and warre ſhall
finde heere holy and great examples.
And if historie
and obſeruation bee the best
Counſellours of your youth;
what ſtorie can bee ſo wiſe
and faithfull as that which
God hath written for men,
wherein you ſee both what
hath beene done, and what
ſhould bee? What obſeruation

ſo worthie as that which
is both raiſed from God,
and directed to him? If the
proprietie which your Highneſſe
iuſtly hath in the worke,
and Author, may draw your
Princely eies and heart the
rather to theſe holy ſpeculations,
your ſeruant ſhall bee
happier in this fauour, than
in all your outward bountie;
as one, to whom your ſpirituall
progreſſe deſerues to bee
dearer than his owne life;
and whoſe daily ſuit is, that
God would guide your ſteps
aright in this ſlipperie age

and continue to reioice all
good hearts in the view of
your gracious proceedings.

                  THE FIRST
BOOKE.
                  
                     The Creation.
                     
                        WHat can I ſee, O God,
in thy Creation but
miracles of wonders?
Thou madeſt ſomething
of nothing, and of that
ſomthing all things. Thou which
waſt without a beginning, gaueſt

a beginning to time, and to the
world in time: It is the praiſe of
vs men if when we haue matter,
we can giue faſhion; thou gaueſt
a beeing to the matter, without
forme; thou gaueſt a form to that
matter, and a glory to that forme;
If wee can but finiſh a ſleight and
vnperfeſt matter, according to a
former patterne, it is the height
of our skill, but to beginne that
which neuer was, whereof there
was no example, whereto there
was no inclination, wherin there
was no poſsibility of that which
it ſhould bee, is proper onely to
ſuch power as thine; the infinite
power of an infinite creator: with
vs, not ſo much as a thought can
ariſe without ſome matter, but
heere with thee, all matter ariſes

from nothing. How eaſie is it for
thee to repaire all out of ſomething,
which couldeſt thus fetch
al out of nothing? wherin can we
now diſtruſt thee, that haſt prooued
thy ſelf thus omnipotent? Behold
to haue made the leaſt clod
of nothing, is more aboue wonder
then to multiply a world; but
now the matter doth not more
praiſe thy power, then the forme
thy wiſedome; what beauty is
heere? what order? what order in
working? what beauty in the
worke.
                     Thou mighteſt haue made all
the world perfect in an inſtant,
but thou wouldeſt not. That wil,
which cauſed thee to create, is
reaſon enough why thou diddeſt

thus create. How ſhould we deliberate
in our actions, which are
ſo ſubiect to imperfection, ſince it
pleaſed thine infinite perfection
(not out of need) to take leaſure.
Neither did thy wiſedome heerein
proceede in time onely, but in
degrees: At firſt thou madeſt nothing
abſolute; firſt thou madeſt
things which ſhould haue being
without life, then thoſe which
ſhould haue life and being; laſtly
thoſe which haue being, life, reaſon:
So we our ſelues in the ordinary
courſe of generation, firſt
liue the life of vegetation, then of
ſenſe, of reaſon afterwards. That
inſtant wherein the heauen and
the earth were created in their
rude matter, there was neither
day nor light, but preſently thou

madeſt both light &amp; day. Whiles
wee haue this example of thine,
how vainely do wee hope to bee
perfect at once? It is well for vs, if
through many degrees wee can
riſe to our conſummation.
                     But (alas) what was the very heuen
it ſelfe without light? how
confuſed? how formeleſſe? like to
a goodly body without a ſoule,
like a ſoule without thee. Thou
art light, and in thee is no darkeneſſe.
Oh how incomprehenſibly
glorious is the light that is in
thee, ſince one glimpſe of this
created light gaue ſo liuely a glory
to al thy workemanſhip! This,
euen the bruite creatures can behold:
That, not the very Angels.
That ſhines foorth onely to the

other ſupreme world of immortality;
this to the baſeſt part of
thy creation. There is one cauſe
of our darkeneſſe on earth, and
of the vtter darkeneſſe in hell, the
reſtraint of thy light. Shine thou
O God, into the vaſt corners of
my ſoule, and in thy light I ſhall
ſee light.
                     But whence, O God, was that
firſt light? The ſunne was not
made till the fourth day, light the
firſt. If man had then beene, he
might haue ſeene all lightſome;
but whence it had come he could
not haue ſeene: As in ſome great
pond, we ſee the bancks full, wee
ſee not the ſprings whence that
water ariſeth. Thou that madeſt
the Sunne, madeſt the light, without

the Sunne, before the Sunne,
that ſo light might depend vpon
thee, and not vpon thy Creature.
Thy power will not be limited to
meanes. It was eaſie to thee to
make an heauen without a Sunne,
light without an heauen, day
without a Sunne, time without
a day: It is good reaſon thou
ſhouldeſt bee the Lord of thine
owne workes. All meanes ſerue
thee: why doe wee weake wretches
diſtruſt thee; in the want of
thoſe meanes, which thou canſt
either command, or forbeare.
How plainly wouldſt thou teach
vs, that wee creatures neede not
one another, ſo long as wee haue
thee? One day we ſhall haue light
againe, without the Sunne. Thou
ſhalt be our Sunne; thy preſence

ſhall be our light: Light is ſowne
for the righteous. This Sunne and
light is but for the world below it
ſelfe; thine only for aboue. Thou
giueſt this light to the Sunne,
which the Sunne giues to the
world: That light which thou
ſhalt once giue vs, ſhall make vs
ſhine like the Sunne in glory.
                     Now this light which for three
daies was thus diſperſed thorow
the whole heauens, it pleaſed
thee at laſt to gather and vnite into
one body of the Sunne. The
whole heauen was our Sunne,
before the Sunne was created: but
now one ſtarre muſt be the Treaſury
of light to the heauen and
earth. How thou loueſt the vnion
and reduction of all things of

one kind to their owne head and
center.
                     So the waters muſt by thy
command be gathered into one
place, the ſea; ſo the vpper waters
muſt be ſeuered by theſe aery limits
from the lower: ſo heauy
ſubſtances haſten downeward,
aud light mount vp: ſo the generall
light of the firſt daies muſt
bee called into the compaſſe of
one ſunne; ſo thou wilt once gather
thine elect from all coaſts of
heauen to the participation of
one glory. Why doe wee abide
our thoughts and affections ſcattered
from thee, from thy Saints,
from thine Annointed? Oh let
this light which thou haſt now
ſpread abroad in the hearts of all
thine, once meet in thee: Wee are

as thy heauens in this their firſt
imperfection; be thou our Sunne,
into which our light may be gathered.
                     Yet this light was by thee interchanged
with darknes, which
thou mightſt as eaſily haue commanded
to bee perpetuall. The
continuance euen of the beſt
things cloieth, and wearieth: there
is nothing but thy ſelfe, wherein
there is not ſatiety. So pleaſing is
the viciſsitude of things, that the
intercourſe euen of thoſe occurrents
which in their owne nature
are leſſe worthy, giues more contentment,
then the vnaltered eſtate
of better. The day dies into
night; and riſes into the morning
againe; that we might not expect

any ſtability heere below, but in
perpetuall ſucceſsion
                           •
                        : It is alwaies
daie with thee aboue: the
night ſauoreth onely of mortalitie:
Why are we not heere ſpiritually
as wee ſhall be heereafter?
Since thou haſt made vs children
of the light, and of the day, teach
vs to walk euer in the light of thy
preſence, not in the darkneſſe of
error and vnbeleefe.
                     Now in this thine inlightned
frame, how fitly, how wiſely are
all the parts diſpoſed; that the
method of the creation might anſwer
the matter, the forme, both.
Behold all purity aboue; below,
the dregges and lees of all. The
higher I goe, the more perfection;
each element ſuperiour to other,

not more in place then dignity;
that by theſe ſtaires of aſcending
perfection our thoughts
might climbe vnto the top of all
glory, and might know thine empyreal
heauen no leſſe glorious aboue
the viſible, than thoſe aboue
the earth. Oh how miſerable is
the place of our pilgrimage, in reſpect
of our home! Let my ſoule
tread a while in the ſteps of thine
owne proceedings; and ſo thinke
as thou wroughteſt: When wee
would deſcribe a man, wee begin
not at the feete, but the head: The
head of thy Creation is the heauen;
how high? how ſpatious?
how glorious? It is a wonder that
we can looke vp to ſo admirable
an height, and that the very eye is
not tyred in the way. If this aſcending

line could bee drawne
right forwards, ſome that haue
calculated curiouſly haue found
it 500. yeares iourney vnto the
ſtarrie heauen. I doe not examine
their arte; O Lord, I wonder rather
at thine, which haſt drawne
ſo large a line about this little
point of earth: For in the plaineſt
rules of art and experience, the
compaſſe muſt needs be ſix times
as much as halfe the height. Wee
thinke one Iland great, but the
earth vnmeaſurably. If wee were
in that heauen with theſe eies, the
whole earth (were it equally inlightned)
would ſeeme as little to
vs, as now the leaſt ſtarre in the
firmament ſeemes to vs vpon
earth: And indeed, how few ſtars
are ſo little as it? And yet how

many void and ample ſpaces are
there beſides all the ſtarres? The
hugeneſſe of this thy worke, O
God, is little inferiour for admiraon
to the maieſty of it. But oh
what a glorious heauen is this
which thou haſt ſpred ouer our
heads? With how pretious a vault
haſt thou walled in this our inferior
world? What worlds of light
haſt thou ſet aboue vs? Thoſe
things which wee ſee are wondrous;
but thoſe which wee
beleeue and ſee not, are yet more.
Thou doſt but ſet out theſe vnto
view, to ſhew vs what there
is within. How proportionable
are thy works to thy ſelfe? Kings
erect not cotages, but ſet foorth
their magnificence in ſumptuous
buildings: ſo haſt thou done, O

King of glory. If the loweſt pauement
of that heauen of thine bee
ſo glorious, what ſhall we thinke
of the better parts yet vnſeene?
And if this Sunne of thine bee of
ſuch brightneſſe and maieſty, oh
what is the glory of the maker of
it? And yet if ſome other of thy
ſtarres were let downe as low as
it, thoſe other ſtarres would bee
Sunnes to vs; which now thou
hadſt rather to haue admired in
their diſtance. And if ſuch a skie
be prepared for the vſe and benefit
euen of thine enemies alſo vpon
earth, how happie ſhall thoſe
eternall Tabernacles bee, which
thou haſt ſequeſtred for thine
owne?
                     Behold then in this high and

ſtately building of thine, I ſee
three ſtages; This loweſt heauen
for fowles, for vapours, for meteors:
The ſecond for the ſtarres:
The third for thine Angels and
Saints. The firſt is thine outward
Court, open for all: The ſecond
is the body of thy couered Temple,
wherin are thoſe candles of
heauen perpetually burning: The
third is thine Holy of Holies. In
the firſt is tumult, and vanity: In
the ſecond immutability &amp; reſt:
In the third glory and bleſſednes.
The firſt we feele, the ſecond we
ſee, the third we beleeue. In theſe
two lower is no felicity, for neither
the fowles, nor ſtarres are
happy. It is the third heauen alone,
where thou, O bleſſed Trinity,
enioyeſt thy ſelfe, and thy

glorified ſpirits inioy thee. It is
the manifeſtation of thy glorious
preſence that makes heauen to
be it ſelfe; This is the priuiledge
of thy children: that they he reſeeing
thee which art inuiſible by
the eye of faith, haue already begun
that heauen which the perfect
ſight of thee ſhall make perfect
aboue. Let my ſoule then
let theſe heauens alone till it may
ſee, as it is ſeeene. That wee may
deſcend to this loweſt and meaneſt
region of heauen, wherwith
our ſenſes are more acquainted;
What maruels doe euen heere
meete with vs? There are thy
clouds the bottles of raine, veſſels
as thin as the liquor which is
contained in them: there they
hange, and mooue, (though

mighty with their burden:) How
they are vpheld, and why they
fall, heere, and now, wee know
not, and wonder; theſe thou makeſt
one while as ſome aery ſeas
to hold water: an other while, as
ſome aery fornaces, whence thou
ſcattereſt thy ſudden fires vnto all
parts of the earth, aſtoniſhing the
world with the fearefull noyſe of
that eruption: out of the midſt of
water thou fetcheſt fire; and hard
ſtones out of the midſt of thinne
vapours; another while, as ſome
ſteele glaſſes, wherein the Sunne
lookes and ſhewes his face in the
variety of thoſe colours which he
hath not; There are thy ſtreames
of light, blazing and falling ſtars,
fires darted vp and downe in many
formes, hollow openings, and

(as it were) gulfes in the skie;
bright circles about the moone,
and other planets, ſnowes, haile:
In all which it is enough to admire
thine hand, though wee
cannot ſearch out thine action.
There are thy ſubtle windes,
which wee heare and feele, yet
neither can ſee their ſubſtance,
nor know their cauſes; whence
and whither they paſſe, and what
they are, thou knoweſt. There
are thy fowles of all ſhapes, colours,
notes, natures: whiles I
compare theſe with the inhabitants
of that other heauen, I find
thoſe ſtarres, and ſpirits like one
another: Theſe meteors and
fowles, in as many varieties, as
there are ſeuerall creatures. Why
is this? Is it becauſe man (for

whoſe ſake theſe are made) delights
in change; thou in conſtancie?
Or is it, that in theſe
thou maieſt ſhew thine owne
skill, and their imperfection▪
There is no varietie in that which
is perfect, becauſe there is but
one perfection; and ſo much
ſhall wee grow neerer to perfectneſſe,
by how much wee draw
neerer to vnitie, and vniformitie.
From thence, if wee goe downe
to the great deepe, the wombe
of moiſture, the well of fountaines,
the great pond of the
world; wee know not whether
to wonder at the Element it ſelfe,
or the gueſts which it containes.
How doth that ſea of thine roare
and fome and ſwell, as if it would
ſwallow vp the earth? Thou

ſtayeſt the rage of it by an incenſible
violence: and by a naturall
miracle confineſt his waues, why
it mooues, and why it ſtaies, it is

                           •
                        o vs equally wonderfull: what liuing
mountaines (ſuch are thy
Whales) rowle vp and downe in
thoſe fearefull billows: for greatneſſe
of number, hugeneſſe of
quantity, ſtrangeneſſe of ſhapes,
variety of faſhions, neither ayre
nor earth can compare with the
waters: I ſay nothing of thy hid
treaſures which thy wiſedome
hath repoſed in the bowels of the
earth and ſea; How ſecretly, and
how baſely are they laide vp? ſecretly,
that wee might not ſeeke
them; baſely, that we might not
ouer eſteeme them: I neede not
dig ſo low as theſe mettals, mineries,

quarres, which yeeld riches
enough of obſeruation to
the ſoule. How many millions of
wonders doth the very face of
the earth offer mee? which of
theſe herbes, floures, trees, leaues,
ſeeds, fruits, is there? What beaſt,
what worme, wherein wee may
not ſee the footſteps of a Deitie:
wherein wee may not read infiniteneſſe
of power of skill: and
muſt be forced to confeſſe, that
hee which made the Angels and
ſtarres of heauen, made alſo the
vermin on earth: O God the hart
of man is too ſtrait to admire enough
euen that which he treads
vpon? What ſhall we ſay to thee
the maker of all theſe? O Lord
how wonderfull are thy works in
all the world, in wiſedome haſt

thou made them all. And in all
theſe thou ſpakeſt, and they were
done. Thy wil is thy word, &amp; thy
word is thy deed. Our tongue,
and hand, and hart are different:
all are one in thee; which art ſimply
one, &amp; infinite. Here needed
no helps, no inſtruments: what
could be preſent with the eternal:
what needed, or what could bee
added to the infinite? Thine hand
is not ſhortned, thy word is ſtill
equally effectuall; ſay thou the
word and my ſoule ſhall be made
new againe: ſay thou the word, &amp;
my body ſhall be repayred from
his duſt. For all things obey thee;
O Lord why doe I not yeeld to
the word of thy counſell; ſince I
muſt yeeld, as all thy creatures, to
the word of thy command?
                  
                  
                     
                     Man.
                     BVt (O God) what a little Lord
haſt thou made ouer this
great world? The leaſt corne of
ſand is not ſo ſmall to the whole
earth, as man is to the heauen:
when I ſee the heauens, the ſun,
moone, and ſtars, O God what is
man? Who would thinke thou
ſhouldſt make all theſe creatures
for one, and that one, well-neere
the leaſt of all? Yet none but hee,
can ſee what thou haſt done;
none but hee can admire, and adore
thee in what he ſeeth; how
had hee need to doe nothing but
this, ſince hee alone muſt doe it?
Certainly the price and vertue of
things conſiſts not in the quantity:

one diamond is more woorth
then manie quarries of ſtone,
one loadſtone hath more vertue
then mountaines of earth: It is
lawfull for vs to praiſe thee in our
ſelues: All thy creation hath not
more wonder in it, then one of
vs: other creatures thou madeſt
by a ſimple command; Man, not
without a diuine conſultation:
others at once; Man thou didſt
firſt forme, then inſpire: others in
ſeuerall ſhapes like to none but
themſelues: Man after thine own
image: others with qualities fit
for ſeruice; Man for dominion;
Man had his name from thee;
They had their names from man;
How ſhold we be conſecrated to
thee aboue all others, ſince thou
haſt beſtowed more coſt on vs

then others? What ſhall I admire
firſt? Thy prouidence in the time
of our creation? Or thy power &amp;
wiſedome in the act? Firſt thou
madeſt the great houſe of the
world &amp; furniſhedſt it: then thou
broughteſt in thy Tenant to poſſeſſe
it; The bare wals had beene
too good for vs, but thy loue was
aboue our deſert: Thou that madeſt
ready the earth for vs before
wee were, haſt by the ſame
mercy prepared a place in heauen
for vs whiles we are on earth.
The ſtage was firſt fully prepared
then was man brought forth, thither,
as an actor, or ſpectator,
that he might neither be idle nor
diſcontent, behold thou hadſt
addreſſed an earth for vſe, an heauen
for contemplation: after thou

hadſt drawne that large and reall
mappe of the world; thou didſt
thus abridge it into this little table
of man; hee alone conſiſts of
Heauen and earth; ſoule and bodie.
Euen this earthly part which
vile in compariſon of the other,
as it is thine (O God) I dare admire
it, though I can neglect it as
mine owne, for loe; this heape of
earth hath an outward reference
to heauen, other creatures grouel
downe to their earth, and haue
all their ſenſes intent vpon it; this
is reared vp towards heauen, and
hath no more power to look beſide
Heauen, then to tread beſide
the earth. Vnto this, euery part
hath his wonder. The head is
neereſt to heauen, as in place, ſo
in reſemblance; both for roundneſſe

of figure, and for thoſe diuine
gueſts which haue their ſeat
in it; There dwell thoſe maieſticall
powers of reſon, which make
a man; all the ſenſes as they haue
their originall from thence, ſo
they doe all agree there to manifeſt
the vertue: how goodly proportions
haſt thou ſet in the face;
ſuch as though oft-times we can
give no reaſon why they pleaſe,
yet tranſport vs to admiration;
what liuing glaſſes are thoſe
which thou haſt placed in the
midſt of this viſage, whereby all
obiects from farre are clearly repreſented
to the minde? and becauſe
their tenderneſſe lyes open
to dangers, how haſt thou defenced
them with hollow bones, and
with prominent browes, and lids?

And leaſt they ſhould bee too
much bent on what they ought
not, thou haſt giuen them peculiar
nerues to pul them vp towards
the ſeat of their reſt? What a
tongue haſt thou giuen him; the
inſtrument not of taſte only, but
of ſpeech? How ſweet and excellent
voyces are formed by that
little looſe filme of fleſh, what an
incredible ſtrength haſt thou giuen
to the weake bonds of the
iawes? What a comely and tower-like
necke, therefore moſt ſinewye
becauſe ſmalleſt. And leſt I
be infinit, what able arms and actiue
hands haſt thou framed him,
whereby he can frame all things
to his owne conceit. In euery
part beauty, ſtrength, conuenience
meet together. Neither is

there any wherof our weakneſſe
cannot giue reaſon, why it
ſhould be otherwiſe. How haſt
thou diſpoſed of all the inward
veſſels, for all offices of life, nouriſhment,
egeſtion, generation;
No vaine ſinew, artery is ydle.
There is no peece in this exquiſite
frame whereof the place, vſe,
forme, doth not admit wonder,
and exceed it: Yet this body if
it be compared to the ſoule, what
is it, but as a clay wall that encompaſſes
a treaſure, as the
woodden boxe of a Ieweller; as
a courſe caſe to a rich inſtrument,
or as a maske to a beautifull face.
Man was made laſt, becauſe hee
was woorthieſt. The ſoule was
inſpired laſt, becauſe yet more
noble; If the body haue this honor

to bee the companion of the
ſoule, yet withall it is the drudge.
If it bee the inſtrument, yet alſo
the clog of that diuine part. The
companion for life, the drudge
for ſeruice, the inſtrument for action,
the clog in reſpect of contemplation.
Theſe external works
are effected by it, the internall
which are more noble, hindered;
Contrary to the bird which ſings
moſt in her cage, but flyes moſt
and higheſt at liberty. This my
ſoule teaches me of it ſelfe, that it
ſelfe cannot conceiue how capable,
how actiue it is. It can paſſe
by her nimble thoughts from
heauen to earth in a moment, it
can be al things, can comprehend
all things; know that which is;
and conceiue of that which neuer

was, neuer ſhall be: Nothing can
fill it, but thou which art infinite,
nothing can limit it but thou
which art euery were. O God
which madeſt it, repleniſh it, poſſeſſe
it. Dwell thou in it which
haſt appointed it to dwel in clay.
The body was made of earth
common to his fellows, the ſoule
inſpired immediatly from God;
The body lay ſenſeleſſe vpon the
earth like it ſelfe, the breath of
liues gaue it what it is, and that
breath was from thee. Sence, motion,
reaſon, are infuſed into it, at
once. From whence then was
this quickening breath? No ayre,
no earth, no water was heere vſed
to giue helpe to this worke:
Thou that breathedſt vpon man,
and gaueſt him the holy ſpirit:

didſt alſo breath vpon the body,
and gaueſt it a liuing ſpirit, wee
are beholden to nothing but
thee for our ſoule. Our fleſh is
from fleſh; our ſpirit is from the
God of ſpirits. How ſhould our
ſoules riſe vp to thee, and fixe
themſelues in their thoughts vpon
thee who alone created them
in their infuſion, &amp; infuſed them
in their creation? How ſhould
they long to returne backe to the
fountaine of their being, and author
of beeing glorious? Why
may we not ſay that this ſoule as
it came from thee, ſo it is like
thee; as thou, ſo it, is one, immateriall,
immortall, vnderſtanding
ſpirit, diſtinguiſhed into three
powers which all make vp one
ſpirit. So thou the wiſe creator of

all things wouldeſt haue ſome
things to reſemble their creator.
Theſe other creatures are all body;
man is body and ſpirit; the
Angels are all ſpirit, not without
a kind of ſpirituall compoſition;
Thou art alone after thine owne
manner, ſimple, glorious, infinite;
No creature can bee like thee in
thy proper being; becauſe it is a
creature; How ſhould our finite,
weake, compounded nature, giue
any perfect reſemblance of thine?
Yet of all viſible creatures thou
vouchſafeſt Man the neereſt correſpondence
to thee: not ſo much
in theſe naturall faculties, as in
thoſe diuine graces, wherewith
thou beautifieſt his ſoule.
                     Our knowledge, holines, righteouſnes

was like the firſt coppy
from which they were drawne;
Behold wee were not more like
thee in theſe, then now wee are
vnlike ourſelues in their loſſe; O
God we now praiſe our ſelues to
our ſhame, for the better we were
we are the worſe, As the ſons of
ſome prodigall or tainted aunceſtors
tell of the lands, and Lordſhips
which were once theirs;
onlie doe thou whet our deſires
anſwerable to the readineſſe of
thy mercies, that we may redeem
what we haue loſt; that wee may
recouer in thee, what wee haue
loſt in our ſelues, The fault ſhall
be ours if our damage proue not
beneficiall.
                     I doe not finde that man thus

framed found the want of an helper.
His fruition of God gaue him
fulneſſe of contentment, the
ſweetneſſe which hee found in
the contemplation of this newe
workmanſhip, and the glory of
the author, did ſo take him vp,
that hee had neither leiſure nor
cauſe of complaint. If man had
craued an helper, he had grudged
at the condition of his creation,
and had queſtioned that which
he had, perfection of being. But
hee that gaue him his being, and
knew him better then himſelfe,
thinks of giuing him comfort in
the creature, whiles hee ſought
none but in his maker; Hee ſees
our wants, and forecaſts our releefe,
when wee thinke our ſelues
too happy to complaine: How

ready will he be to helpe our neceſsities,
that thus prouides for
our perfection?
                     God giues the nature to his
creatures, Man muſt giue the
name, that hee might ſee they
were made for him, they ſhal be,
to him what hee will. In ſtead of
their firſt homage, they are preſented
to their new Lord, and
muſt ſee of whom they hold. He
that was ſo carefull of mans ſoueraignty
in his innocence, how
can he be careleſſe of his ſafety in
his renouation?
                     If God had giuen them their
names, it had not bene ſo great
a praiſe of Adams memory to recall
them as it was now of his

iudgement (at firſt ſight) to impoſe
them, hee ſaw the inſide of
all the creatures at firſt; (his poſterity
ſees but their skins euer
ſince;) and by this knowledge he
fitted their names to their diſpoſitions.
All that hee ſaw were fit
to be his ſeruants, none to be his
companions. The ſame God that
finds the want, ſupplies it. Rather
then mans innocency ſhall
want an outward comfort, God
will begin a new creation. Not
out of the earth which was the
matter of man, not out of the inferiour
creatures, which were the
ſeruants of Man, but out of himſelfe,
for dearneſſe, for equality.
Doubtleſſe ſuch was mans power
of obedience, that if God had bidden
him yeeld vp his rib, waking,

for this vſe, he had done it cheerfully,
but the bounty of God
was ſo abſolute, that hee would
not ſo much as conſult with mans
will, to make him happy. As man
knew not while hee was made, ſo
ſhal he not know while his other
ſelfe is made out of him: that the
comfort might be greater, which
was ſeene before it was expected.
                     If the woman ſhould haue bin
made, not without the paine, or
will of the man, ſhe might haue
bene vpbrayded with her dependance,
and obligation. Now ſhee
owes nothing but to her creator:
The ribbe of Adam ſleeping, can
challenge no more of her, then
the earth can of him. It was an
happy change to Adam of a ribbe,

for an helper; what help did that
bone giue to his ſide? God had
not made it, if it had beene ſuperfluous:
and yet if man could not
haue beene perfect without it, it
had not beene taken out.
                     Many things are vſe-ful &amp; conuenient,
which are not neceſſary,
and if God had ſeene man might
not want it, how eaſie had it been
for him which made the woman
of that bone, to turne the fleſh into
another bone? but he ſaw man
could not complaine of the want
of that bone, which hee had ſo
multiplied, ſo animated.
                     O God, wee can neuer be looſers
by thy changes, we haue nothing
but what is thine, take from

vs thine own, when thou wilt, we
are ſure thou canſt not but giue
vs better.
                  
                  
                     Paradiſe.
                     MAn could no ſooner ſee,
then hee ſaw himſelfe happie:
His eye-ſight and reaſon
were both perfect at once, and
the obiects of both were able to
make him as happy as he would,
when he firſt opened his eies, he
ſaw heauen aboue him, earth vnder
him, the creatures about him,
God before him, hee knew what
all theſe things meant, as if he had
been long acquainted with them
all: He ſaw the heauens glorious,

but farre off, his maker thought
it requiſite to fit him with a paradiſe
neerer home. If God had appointed
him immediatly to heauen,
his body had beene ſuperfluous;
It was fit his body ſhould
bee anſwered with an earthen image
of that heauen which was
for his ſoule: Had man bin made
only for contemplation, it would
haue ſerued as well to haue been
placed in ſome vaſt deſert, on the
top of ſome barren mountaine;
But the ſame power which gaue
him an hart to meditate, gaue him
hands to worke; and work fit for
his hands; Neither was it the purpoſe
of the Creator that man
ſhould but liue: meſure may ſtand
with innocence; he that reioyced
to ſee al he had made to be good,

reioyceth to ſee all that hee had
made to be well; God loues to ſee
his creatures happy; Our lawfull
delight is his: they know not God
that thinke to pleaſe him with
making themſelues miſerable.
                     The Idolaters thought it a fit
ſeruice for Baal to cut and launce
themſelues; neuer any holy man
lookt for thanks from the true
God by wronging himſelfe. Euery
earth was not fit for Adam, but
a Garden; a Paradiſe: What excellent
pleaſures, and rare varieties
haue men found in gardens
planted by the hands of men?
And yet all the world of men
cannot make one twig, or leafe, or
ſpire of graſſe: When hee that
made the matter vndertakes the

faſhion, how muſt it needs be beyond
our capacity excellent? No
herb, no flower, no tree was wanting
there, that might bee for ornament
or vſe; whether for ſight,
or for ſent, or for taſt. The bounty
of God wrought further then
to neceſsity: euen to comfort and
recreation: Why are we niggardly
to our ſelues when God is liberall?
But for all this; if God had
not there conuerſed with man,
no abundance could haue made
him bleſſed.
                     Yet beholde that which was
mans ſtore houſe, was alſo his
workehouſe; His pleaſure was his
taske, Paradiſe ſerued not onely
to feed his ſenſes, but to exerciſe
his hands: If happineſſe had conſiſted

in doing nothing, man had
not beene employed; All his delights
could not haue made him
happy in an idle life. Man therefore
is no ſooner made, then he is
ſet to worke: Neither greatneſſe
nor perfection can priuiledge a
foulded hand; Hee muſt labour
becauſe hee was happy; how
much more we, that we may bee?
This firſt labor of his was as without
neceſsity, ſo without paines,
without wearineſſe; how much
more cheerefully wee goe about
our buſineſſes, ſo much neerer we
come to our Paradiſe:
                     Neither did theſe trees affoord
him onely action for his hands,
but inſtruction to his heart,
for here he ſaw Gods ſacraments

grow before him; All other trees
had a naturall vſe; theſe two in
the midſt of the Garden, a ſpirituall;
Life is the act of the ſoule,
knowledge the life of the ſoule;
the tree of knowledge, and the
tree of life then, were ordained as
earthly helpes of the ſpirituall
part: Perhaps he which ordained
the ende, immortality of life; did
appoint this fruit as the meanes,
of that life; It is not for vs to inquire
after the life wee had; and
the meanes we ſhould haue had,
I am ſure it ſerued to nouriſh the
ſoule by a liuely repreſentation
of that liuing tree, whoſe fruite
is eternall life, and whoſe leaues
ſerue to heale the nations.
                     O infinite mercy, man ſaw his

Sauiour before him; ere hee had
need of a Sauiour, hee ſaw in
whom hee ſhould recouer an
heauenly life, ere hee loſt the
earthly; but after man had taſted
of the tree of knowledge, hee
might not taſte of the tree of life;
That immortall food was not for
a mortall ſtomacke: Yet then did
he moſt ſauour that inuiſible tree
of life, when he was moſt reſtrayned
from the other.
                     O Sauiour, none but a ſinner
can relliſh thee: My taſt hath bin
enough ſeaſoned with the forbidden
fruit, to make it capable of
thy ſweetneſſe; Sharpen thou as
well the ſtomacke of my ſoule
by repenting as by beleeuing,
ſo ſhall I eate in deſpight of AAdam,
                        
liue for euer. The one tree
was for confirmation; the other
for tryall, one ſhewed him what
life hee ſhould haue, the other
what knowledge hee ſhould not
deſire to haue: Alas, he that knew
al other things, knew not this one
thing, that he knew enough: how
Diuine a thing is knowledge,
whereof euen innocencie it ſelfe
is ambitious? Satan knew what he
did, If this bayt had beene gold,
or honour, or pleaſure, man had
contemned it, who can hope to
auoide error, when euen mans
perfection is miſtaken? He lookt
for ſpeculatiue knowledge, hee
ſhould haue looked for experimentall:
he thought it had beene
good to know euill: Good was
large enough to haue perfected

his knowledge, and therein his
bleſſedneſſe.
                     All that God made was good,
and the maker of them much
more good; they good in their
kinds, hee good in himſelfe. It
would not content him to know
God, and his creatures, his curioſity
affected to know that which
God neuer made, euill of ſin, and
euill of death, which indeed himſelfe
made, by deſiring to know
them; now we know well euill enough
&amp; ſmart with knowing it.
How dear hath this leſſon coſt vs
that in ſome caſes it is better to be
ignorant; And yet do the ſons of
Eue inherit this ſaucy appetite of
their grandmother; How many
thouſand ſoules miſcarry with

the preſumptuous affectation of
forbidden knowledge:
                     O God, thou haſt reuealed
more then we can know, enough
to make vs happy, teach me a ſober
knowledge and a contented
ignorance.
                     Paradiſe was made for man,
yet there I ſee the ſerpent; what
maruell is it if my corruption find
the ſerpent in my cloſet, in my
table, in my bed, when our holie
parents found him in the
midſt of Paradiſe: no ſooner is he
entred but he tempteth, hee can
no more bee idle, then harmleſſe,
I doe not ſee him at any other
tree; hee knew there was no
danger in the reſt▪ I ſee him at the

tree forbidden. How true a ſerpent
is he in euery point; In his
inſinuation to the place; in his
choyce of the tree, in his aſſault
of the woman, in his plauſiblenes
of ſpeech to auoid terror, in his
queſtion to moue doubt, in his
reply to work diſtruſt, in his proteſtation
of ſafety, in his ſuggeſtion
to enuy and diſcontent, in his
promiſe of gaine.
                     And if hee were ſo cunning at
the firſt, what ſhall wee thinke of
him now, after ſo many thouſand
yeares experience? Onely thou,
(O God) and theſe Angels that
ſee thy face are wiſer then hee; I
doe not aske why, when hee left
his goodneſſe, thou didſt not bereaue
him of his skill? Still thou

wouldſt haue him an Angell,
though an euill one, And thou
knoweſt how to ordaine his crait
to thine owne glory; I do not deſire
thee to abate of his ſubtilty,
but to make me wiſe; Let me beg
it without preſumption, make
me wiſer then Adam; euen thine
image which he bore, made him
not (through his owne weaknes)
wiſe enough to obey thee; thou
offeredſt him al fruits, and reſtrainedſt
but one; Satan offered him
but one and reſtrained not the
reſt; when he choſe rather to bee
at Satans feeding then thine, it
was iuſt with thee to turne him
out of thy gates, with a curſe: why
ſhouldeſt thou feede a rebell at
thine owne boord?
                     And yet wee tranſgreſſe daily,

and thou ſhutteſt not heauen againſt
vs: how is it that wee find
more mercy then our forefathers?
His ſtrength is worthy of
ſeuerity, our weakneſſe finds pittie.
That God from whoſe face
he fled in the garden, now makes
him with ſhame to flye out of
the garden: thoſe Angels that
ſhould haue kept him, now keep
the gates of Paradiſe againſt him;
It is not ſo eaſie to recouer happineſſe,
as to keepe it, or leeſe it:
Yea the ſame cauſe that droue
man from Paradiſe, hath alſo
withdrawne paradiſe from the
world.
                     That fiery ſword did not defend
it againſt thoſe waters
wherwith the ſins of men drowned

the glory of that place: neither
now do I care to ſeek where
that paradiſe was which we loſt,
I know where that Paradiſe is,
which we muſt care to ſeeke; and
hope to finde; As man was the
image of God, ſo was that earthly
Paradiſe an image of heauen;
both the images are defaced,
both the firſt paterns are eternall:
Adam was in the firſt, and ſtayed
not: In the ſecond, is the ſecond
Adam which ſaide, This day ſhalt
thou be with mee in Paradiſe. There
was that choſen veſſell, &amp; heard,
and ſaw what could not bee expreſſed,
by how much the third
heauen exceeds the richeſt earth,
ſo much doth that Paradiſe wherto
wee aſpire exceed that which
we haue loſt.
                  
                  
                     
                     Cain and Abell.
                     LOoke now (O my ſoule) vpon
the two firſt brethren, perhaps
twins; and wonder at their
contrary diſpoſitions and eſtates:
If the priuiledges of nature had
beene worth any thing, the firſt
borne child ſhould not haue bin
a reprobate.
                     Now that wee may aſcribe all
to free grace, the elder is a murderer,
the yonger a ſaint, though
goodneſſe may bee repaired in
our ſelues, yet it cannot bee propagated
to ours: Now might
Adam ſee the image of himſelfe
in Cain, for after his owne image
begot hee him, Adam ſlew

his poſterity, Cain his brother, we
are too like one another in that
wherein we are vnlike to God: Euen
the cleereſt grain ſends forth
that chaffe from which it was fanned,
ere the ſowing: yet is this
Cain a poſſeſsion, the ſame Eue
that miſtooke the fruit of the garden,
miſtooke alſo the fruit of her
owne body, her hope deceiued
her in both; ſo, many good names
are ill beſtowed; and our comfortable
expectations in earthly
things do not ſeldome diſappoint
vs, doubtleſſe their education was
holy; For Adam though in Paradiſe
hee could not bee innocent,
yet was a good man out of Paradiſe;
his ſinne and fall now made
him circumſpect, and ſince hee
ſaw that his act had bereaued

them of that image of God which
he once had for them, hee could
not but labour by all holy indeuours
to repayre it in them. That
ſo his care might make a mends
for his treſpaſſe: How plaine is it,
that euen good breeding cannot
alter deſtiny? That which is crooked
can none make ſtraight, who
would thinke that brethren, and
but two brethren: ſhould not
loue each other, Diſperſed loue
growes weake, and fewneſſe of
obiects vſeth to vnite affections:
If but two brothers bee left aliue
of many, they thinke that the
loue of all the reſt ſhould ſuruiue
in them; and now the beames of
their affection are ſo much the
hoter, becauſe they reflect mutually
in a right line vppon each other:

yet behold, here are but two
brothers in a world; and one is
the butcher of the other. Who
can wonder at diſſentions amongſt
thouſands of brethren,
when he ſees ſo deadly oppoſition
betwixt two, the firſt roots of
brotherhood: who can hope to
liue plauſibly and ſecurely amongſt
ſo many Cains, when hee
ſees one Cain the death of one Abel?
The ſame diuell that ſet enmity
betwixt man and god; ſets enmity
betwixt man and man, and
yet God ſaid; I will put enmity
betweene thy ſeed and her ſeed,
our hatred of the ſerpent and his
ſeed is from God: Their hatred of
the holy ſeed is from the ſerpent;
Behold here at once, in one perſon
the ſeed of the woman and of

the ſerpent, Cains naturall parts
are of the woman; his vitious
qualities of the ſerpent; The woman
gaue him to bee a brother,
the ſerpent to be a manſlayer, all
vncharitableneſſe, all quarrels are
of one author: we cannot entertaine
wrath, and not giue place to
the Diuell. Certainely, ſo deadly
an act muſt needs bee deepely
grounded.
                     What then was the occaſion
of this capitall malice? Abels ſacrifice
is accepted; what was this to
Cain? Cains is reiected; what could
Abel remedy this? Oh enuie; the
corraſiue of all ill minds; and the
root of all deſperate actions: the
ſame cauſe that moued Satan to
tempt the firſt man, to deſtroy

himſelfe, and his poſterity, the
ſame moues the ſecond man to
deſtroy the third:
                     It ſhould haue beene Cains ioy
to ſee his brother accepted; It
ſhould haue bene his ſorrow, to
ſee that himſelfe had deſerued a
reiection, his brothers example
ſhould haue excited, and directed
him: Could Abel haue ſtayed
Gods fire from deſcending? Or
ſhold he (if he could) reiect Gods
acceptation, and diſpleaſe his maker,
to content a brother? Was
Cain euer the farther from a bleſſing,
becauſe his brother obtained
mercy? How proud and fooliſh
is malice? which growes thus
mad, for no other cauſe, but becauſe
God, or Abel is not leſſe

good; It hath beene an olde and
happy danger to be holy; Indifferent
actions muſt bee carefull
to auoide offence; But I care not
what diuell or what Cain bee angry
that I doe good, or receiue
good.
                     There was neuer any nature
without enuy; Euery man is born
a Cain; hating that goodnes in another,
which hee neglected in
himſelfe; There was neuer enuie
that was not bloody; for if it eat
not anothers hart, it will eat our
owne, but vnleſſe it be reſtrained
it will ſurely feed it ſelfe with the
blood of others, oft times in act,
alwaies in affection. And that
God which (in good) accepts the
will for the deed, condemns the

will for the deed in euill. If there
be an euill heart, there will bee an
euill eye, and if both theſe, there
will be an euill hand
                     How earely did Martyrdome
come into the world? The firſt
man that died, died for religion;
who dare meaſure Gods loue by
outward euents, when hee ſees
wicked Cain ſtanding ouer bleeding
Abel; whoſe ſacrifice was firſt
accepted, and now himſelfe is ſacrificed.
Death was denounced to
man as a curſe; yet behold it firſt
lights vppon a Saint, how ſoone
was it altered by the mercy of
that iuſt hand which inflicted it?
If death had beene euill, and life
good; Cain had beene ſlaine, and
Abel had ſuruiued, now that it begins

with him that God loues, O
death where is thy ſting?
                     
                        Abel ſayes nothing, his blood
cries: Euery drop of innocent
blood hath a tongue, and is not
onely vocall, but importunate,
what a noiſe then did the blood
of my Sauiour make in heauen,
who was himſelfe the ſhepheard
and the ſacrifice; The man that
was offered, and the God to
whome it was offered; The ſpirit
that herd both ſaies, it ſpake better
things then the blood of Abel;
Abels blood called for reuenge
his for mercy; Abels pleaded his
owne innocency, his, the ſatisfaction
for all the beleeuing world:
Abels procured Cains puniſhment,
his, freed all repentant ſouls from

puniſhment, better things indeed,
then the blood of Abel. Better,
and therfore that which Abels
blood ſaid, was good: It is good
that God ſhould bee auenged of
ſinners, Execution of iuſtice vpon
offenders, is no leſſe good, then
rewards of goodnes.
                     No ſooner doth Abels blood
ſpeake vnto God, then God
ſpeaks to Cain; There is no wicked
man to whom God ſpeakes not,
if not to his eare, yet to his heart:
what ſpeech was this? Not an accuſation,
but an inquiry, yet ſuch
an enquiry as would infer an accuſation,
God loues to haue a
ſinner accuſe himſelfe, and therefore
hath he ſet his deputy in the
breſt of man, neither doth God

loue this, more then nature abhors
it: Cain anſwers ſtubbornly:
The very name of Abel wounds
him no leſſe, then his hand had
wounded Abel: Conſciences that
are without remorſe, are not
without horror: wickednes makes
men deſperate; the murderer is
angry with God, as of late for accepting
his brothers oblation, ſo
now for liſtening to his blood.
                     And now he dares anſwer God
with a queſtion, Am I my brothers
keeper? where he ſhold haue
ſaid, am not I my brothers murderer.
Behold he ſcorneth to keep
whom he feared not to kill, Good
duties are baſe and troubleſome
to wicked minds, whiles euen violences
of euill are pleaſant, Yet

this miſcreant which neither had
grace to auoid his ſinne, nor to
confeſſe it, now that he is conuinced
of ſinne, and curſed for it, how
he howleth, how he exclaimeth?
Hee that cares not for the act of
his ſinne, ſhall care for the ſmart
of his puniſhment. The damned
are weary of their torments, but
in vaine. How great a madneſſe is
it to complaine too late; He that
would not keepe his brother, is
caſt out from the protection of
God; he that feared not to kill his
brother, feares now, that whoſoeuer
meets him will kill him. The
troubled conſcience proiecteth
fearefull things, and ſin makes euen
cruell men cowardly: God
ſaw it was too much fauour for
him to dye: he therfore wils that

which Cain wils; Cain would liue;
It is yeelded him, but for a curſe,
how oft doth God heare ſinners
in anger? Hee ſhall liue, baniſhed
from God, carying his hell in his
boſome, and the brand of Gods
vengeance in his forehead, God
reiects him, the earth repines at
him, men abhorre him; himſelfe
now wiſhes that death which he
feared, and no man dare pleaſure
him with a murder; how bitter is
the end of ſin, yea without end;
ſtill Cain finds that he killed himſelfe
more then his brother, wee
ſhould neuer ſin if our foreſight
were but as good as our ſence;
The iſſue of ſin would appeare a
thouſand times more horrible,
then the act is Pleaſant.
                  
                  
                     
                     The Deluge.
                     THe world was grown ſo foul
with ſin, that God ſaw it was
time to waſh it with a flood. And
ſo cloſe did wickednes cleaue to
the authors of it, that when they
were waſht to nothing, yet it
would not off, yea ſo deepe did it
ſticke in the very graine of the
earth; that God ſaw it meet to let
it ſoke long vnder the waters. So
vnder the Law, the very veſſels
that had touched vncleane water
muſt either be rinced, or broken,
Mankind began but with one,
and yet he that ſaw the firſt man,
liued to ſee the earth peopled
with a world of men, yet men

grew not ſo faſt as wickednes, one
man could ſoone and eaſily multiply
a thouſand ſins, neuer man
had ſo many children, ſo that
when there were men enough to
ſtore the earth, there were as many
ſins as would reach vp to heauen,
whereupon the waters came
downe from heauen, and ſwelled
vp to heauen againe, If there had
not been ſo deepe a deluge of ſin,
there had beene none of the waters:
From whence then was this
ſuperfluity of iniquity? Whence,
but from the vnequall yoke with
Infidels? Theſe mariages did not
beget men, ſo much as wickedneſſe;
from hence religious huſbands
both loſt their piety, and
gained a rebellious and godleſſe
generation.
                     
                        
That which was the firſt occaſion
of ſinne, was the occaſion of
the increaſe of ſinne, A woman
ſeduced Adam, women betray
theſe ſons of God, the beauty of
the apple betrayd the woman,
the beauty of theſe women betrayd
this holy ſeed, Eue ſaw and
luſted, ſo did they, this alſo was
a forbidden fruit, they luſted, taſted,
ſinned, died; the moſt ſins
begin at the eyes, by them commonly
Satan creeps into the hart
that ſoule can neuer bee in ſafety
that hath not couenanted with
his eyes.
                     God needed not haue giuen
theſe men any warning of his
iudgement, They gaue him no
warning of their ſins, no reſpite:

yet that God might approue his
mercies to the very wicked; hee
giues them an hundred &amp; twenty
yeares reſpite of repenting,
how loath is God to ſtrike, that
threats ſo long, hee that delights
in reuenge, ſurpriſes his aduerſary,
whereas hee that giues long
warnings deſires to be preuented
if we were not wilfull, we ſhould
neuer ſmart.
                     Neither doth hee giue them
time onely, but a faithful teacher.
It is an happy thing when hee
that teacheth others is righteous;
Noahs hand taught them as much
as his tongue. His buſineſſe in
building the Arke was a reall ſermon
to the world, wherein at
once were taught mercy and life

to the beleuers; and to the rebellious
deſtruction.
                     Mee thinks I ſee thoſe monſtrous
ſonnes of Lamech comming
to Noah, and asking him, what he
meanes by that ſtrange worke;
whether hee meane to ſaile vpon
the dry land. To whom when he
reports Gods purpoſe, and his,
they go away laughing at his idlenes,
and tell one another, in
ſport, that too much holineſſe
hath made him mad: yet cannot
they al flout Noah out of his faith,
he preaches and builds and finiſhes.
Doubtles more hands went
to this work than his: many a one
wrought vpon the Arke, which
yet was not ſaued in the Arke.
Our outward works cannot ſaue

vs without our faith, wee may
helpe to ſaue others, and periſh
our ſelues: what a wonder of mercy
is this that I here ſee? One poor
family called out of a world, and
as it were eight graines of corne
fanned from a whole barne ful of
chaffe: one hypocrite was ſaued
with the reſt, for Noahs ſake, not
one righteous man was ſwept away
for companie; For theſe few
was the earth preſerued ſtill vnder
the waters; and all kinds of
creatures vpon the waters; which
elſe had been all deſtroyed. Still
the world ſtands, for their ſakes,
for whom it was preſerued; Elſe
fire ſhould conſume that, which
could not be cleanſed by water.
                     This difference is ſtrange; I ſee

the ſauageſt of all creatures, lions
tygers; beares by an inſtinct from
God come to ſeeke the Arke, (as
we ſee Swine foreſeeing a ſtorme,
run home crying for ſhelter; men
I ſee not; Reaſon once debauched
is worſe then brutiſhneſſe: God
hath vſe even of theſe fierce and
cruell beaſts, and glorie by them,
even they being created for man,
muſt liue by him, though to his
puniſhment: how greatly do they
offer &amp; ſubmit themſelues to their
preſeruer; renewing that obeyſance
to this repairer of the world
which, they before ſin, yeelded
to him that firſt ſtored the world:
He that ſhut them into the Arke
when they were entred, ſhut
their mouths alſo while they did
enter. The Lions faune vpon Noah,
                        
and Daniel; What hart cannot
the maker of them mollifie?
                     The vnclean beaſts God would
haue to liue, the cleane to multiplie;
and therefore hee ſends to
Noah ſeauen of the cleane, of the
vncleane two: He knew the one
would annoy man with their
multitude, the other would inrich
him; Thoſe things are worthie
of moſt reſpect which are of
moſt vſe.
                     But why ſeven? Surely that
God that created ſeuen daies in
the week, and made one for himſelfe;
did heere preſerue of ſeuen
cleane beaſts, one for himſelfe;
for Sacrifice: He giues vs ſixe for
one in earthly things, that in ſpirituall

we ſhould be all for him.
                     Now the day is come, all the
gueſts are entred, the Ark is ſhut,
and the windowes of heauen opened:
I doubt not but many of
thoſe ſcoffers, when they ſaw the
violence of the waters deſcending,
and aſcending, according
to Noahs prediction, came wading
middle-deep vnto the Ark,
and importunately craued that
admittance, which they once denied.
But now, as they formerly
reiected God, ſo are they iuſtly
reiected of God: Ere vengeance
begin, repentance is ſeaſonable;
but if iudgement bee once gone
out, wee cry too late; while the
Goſpell ſolicites vs, the doores of
the Arke are open; if wee neglect
the time of grace, in vaine ſhal we

ſeeke it with teares, God holds it
no mercy to pitty the obſtinate.
Others more bolde then they,
hope to ouer-runne the iudgement,
and climbing vp to the hye
mountaines looke downe vppon
the waters, with more hope then
feare: and now when they ſee
their hils become Ilands, they
climbe vp into the talleſt trees
there with palenes and horror at
once looke for death, &amp; ſtudy to
auoid it, whom the waues ouertake
at laſt halfe dead with famin
and halfe with fear. Lo now from
the tops of the mountaines they
deſcrie the Ark floting vpon the
waters, and beholde with enuy
that which before they beheld
with ſcorne.
                     In vain doth he flie whom God

purſues. There is no way to flie
from his iudgements, but to flie
to his mercy by repenting. The
faith of the righteous cannot bee
ſo much derided, as their ſucceſſe
is magnified: How ſecurely doth
Noah ride out this vprore of heauen,
earth, and waters? He heares
the powring downe of the raine
aboue his head, the ſhrieking of
men, and roaring, and bellowing
of beaſts, on both ſides him, the
raging and threats of the waues
vnder him, hee ſaw the miſerable
ſhifts of the diſtreſſed vnbeleeuers;
and in the meane time ſits
quietly in his drye Cabin, neither
feeling nor fearing euill, he knew
that he which owed the waters,
would ſteere him, that hee who
ſhut him in, would preſerue him.

How happy a thing is faith?
What a quiet ſafety, what an heauenly
peace doth it worke in the
ſoule, in the midſt of all the inundations
of euill?
                     Now when God had fetcht againe
all the life which he had giuen
to his vnworthy creatures,
and reduced the world vnto his
firſt forme wherein waters were
ouer the face of the earth, it was
time for a renouation of al things
to ſucceed this deſtruction; To
haue continued this deluge long,
had beene to puniſh Noah, that
was righteous; After fourty daies
therefore, the heauens cleare vp,
after 150. the waters ſink downe:
How ſoone is God weary of
puniſhing, which is neuer weary

of bleſsing; yet may not the
Arke reſt ſuddenly, If we did not
ſtay ſom-while vnder Gods hand
we ſhould not know how ſweete
his mercy is, and how great our
thankfulneſſe ſhould bee, The
Arke though it was Noahs ſort againſt
the waters, yet it was his
priſon, he was ſafe in it, but pent
vp; hee that gaue him life by it,
now thinks time to giue him liberty
out of it.
                     God doth not reueale all things
to his beſt ſeruants, beholde hee
that tolde Noah 120. yeares before,
what day he ſhould go into
the Arke, yet foretels him not
now in the Arke what day the
Arke ſhould reſt vpon the hils,
and hee ſhould goe forth; Noah
                        
therfore ſends out his intelligencers,
the Rauen, and the Doue:
whoſe wings in that vaporous
ayre might eaſily deſcry further
then his ſight: The Rauen of
quicke ſent, of groſſe 
                           •
                        eede, of
tough conſtitution, no foule was
ſo fit for diſcouery; the likelieſt
things alwaies ſucceed not; Hee
neither will venter farre into that
ſolitary world for feare of want,
nor yet come into the Arke for
loue of liberty; but houers about
in vncertainties. How many carnall
minds flye out of the Arke of
Gods Church; and imbrace the
preſent world: rather chooſing to
feed vpon the vnſauory carcaſſes
of ſinfull pleaſures; then to be reſtrained
within the ſtraite liſts of
Chriſtian obedience.
                     
                        
The Doue is ſent forth, a foule,
both ſwift and ſimple. She like a
true citizen of the Arke, returnes;
and brings faithfull notice; of the
continuance of the waters by her
reſtleſſe and empty returne; by
her Oliue leafe, of the abatement:
how woorthy are thoſe meſſengers
to be welcome, which with
innocence in their liues, bring
glad tidings of peace, and ſaluation
in their mouthes?
                     
                        Noah reioyces, and beleeues; yet
ſtill hee waites ſeuen daies more:
It is not good to deuoure the fauours
of God too greedily; but
ſo take them in, that wee may digeſt
them: oh ſtrong faith of Noah
that was not weary with this
delay; ſome man would haue ſo

longed for the open ayre after ſo
long cloſenes, that vpon the firſt
notice of ſafety hee would haue
vncouered, and voyded the Ark;
Noah ſtayes ſeuen daies ere hee
will open; and well neere two
moneths ere hee will forſake the
Arke; and not then, vnleſſe God
that commanded to enter, had
bidden him depart. There is no
action good without faith: no
faith without a word. Happy is

                  TO THE RIGHT
Honourable the LORD
STANHOPE one of
his Maieſties moſt Honourable
priuy Counſell,
All grace and happineſſe.
                  
                     RIGHT Honourable: I
durſt appeale to the iudgment
of a carnall Reader
(let him not bee preiudicate)
that there is no history ſo pleaſant
as the ſacred; ſet aſide the maiestie of
the inditer; none can compare with it,
for the Magnificence and Antiquity of
the matter, the ſweetneſſe of compiling,

the ſtrange variety of memorable occurrences:
And if the delight bee ſuch,
what ſhal the profit be esteemed of that
which was written by God for the ſaluation
of men: I confeſſe no thoughts did
euer more ſweetly ſteale me and time away,
then thoſe which I haue employed
in this ſubiect, and I hope none can equally
benefit others, for if the meere relation
of theſe holy things bee profitable,
how much more when it is reduced to
vſe: This ſecond part of the world repaired,
I dedicate to your Lordſhip,
wherein you ſhall ſee Noah as weake
in his Tent, as ſtrong in the Arke, an
vngratious ſon reſerued from the Deluge
to his Fathers curſe: modest piety
rewarded with bleſsings, the building of
Babell, begun in pride, ending in confuſion.
Abrahams faith, feare, obedience,
Iſaac bound vpon the Altar vnder

the hand of a Father that hath forgotten
both nature, and all his hopes;
Sodom burning with a double fire,
from hell, and from heauen: Lot reſcued
from that impure Citie, yet after finding
Sodom in his caue: Euery one of
theſe paſſages is not more full of wonder,
then of edification. That ſpirit
which hath penned all theſe things for
our learning, teach vs their right vſe:
and ſanctifye theſe my vnworthy meditations
to the good of his Church. To
whoſe abundant grace I humbly commend
your Lordſhip.
                  
                     Your Lordſhips vnfainedly
deuoted in all due
obſeruance.

BOOKE.
                  
                     Noah.
                     
                        NO ſooner is NOAH
come out of the Ark,
but hee builds an Altar:
not an houſe for
himſelfe, but an Altar to the Lord:
Our faith will euer teach vs to
preferre God to our ſelues; delayed
thankfulneſſe is not woorthy
of acceptation, Of thoſe few creatures
that are leaſt, God muſt
haue ſome; they are all his, yet his

goodneſſe will haue man know,
that it was he, for whoſe ſake they
were preſerued; It was a priuiledge
to thoſe very bruit creatures
that they were ſaued from
the waters, to be offered vp in fire
vnto God; what a fauour is it to
men to bee reſerued from common
deſtructions, to be ſacrificed
to their maker, and redeemer.
                     Lo this little fire of Noah,
through the vertue of his faith,
purged the world, and aſcended
vp into thoſe heuens from which
the waters fell, and cauſed a glorious
raine-bow to appeare therin
for his ſecurity: All the ſins of the
former world were not ſo vnſauory
vnto God, as this ſmoke was
pleaſant. No perfume can bee ſo

ſweete as the holy obedience of
the faithfull. Now God that was
before annoyed with the ill ſauor
of ſinne, ſmels a ſweet ſauor of
reſt: Behold heere a new and ſecond
reſt: Firſt God reſted from
making the world, now hee reſts
from deſtroying it: Euen while
we ceaſe not to offend, hee ceaſes
from a publique reuenge.
                     His worde was enough; yet
withall hee giues a ſigne; which
may ſpeake the trueth of his promiſe
to the very eies of men, thus
he doth ſtill in his bleſſed Sacraments,
which are as reall words to
the ſoule: The raine-bow is the
pledge of our ſafety; which euen
naturally ſignifies the ende of a
ſhowre; all the ſignes of Gods inſtitution

are proper, and fignificant.
                     But who would looke after all
this to haue found righteous Noah
the Father of the new world,
lying drunken in his tent? Who
could thinke that wine ſhould ouerthrow
him that was preſerued
from the waters? That hee who
could not bee tainted with the
ſinfull examples of the former
world, ſhould begin the example
of a new ſinne of his owne? What
are wee men, if wee bee but our
ſelues? While God vpholds vs, no
temptation can moue vs, when
he leaues vs, no temptation is too
weake to ouerthrow vs? What liuing
man had euer ſo noble
proofes of the mercy, of the iuſtice

of God? Mercy vpon himſelfe,
iuſtice vpon others: What
man had ſo gratious approbation
from his maker: behold hee of
whom in an vncleane world God
ſaid. Thee onely haue I found
righteous, proues now vncleane,
when the world was purged: The
preacher of righteouſneſſe vnto
the former age, the King, Prieſt,
and Prophet of the world renued
is the firſt that renues the ſins of
that world which he had reprooued,
and which he ſaw condemned
for ſinne: Gods beſt children
haue no fence for ſinnes of infirmitie:
Which of the Saints haue
not once done that, wherof they
are aſhamed? God that lets vs fall
knows how to make as good vſe
of the ſins of his holy ones as of

their obedience: If wee had not
ſuch patterns, who could chooſe
but deſpaire at the ſight of his
ſinnes?
                     Yet we find Noah drunken but
once, one act can no more make
a good heart vnrighteous, then
a trade of ſinne can ſtand with regeneration,
but when I looke to
the effect of this ſin, I can not but
bluſh and wonder; Lo this ſinne,
is worſe then ſinne; Other ſinnes
moue ſhame but hide it, this diſplayes
it to the world, Adam had
no ſooner ſinned, but he ſaw and
abhord his owne nakednes, ſeeking
to hide it euen with buſhes.
                     
                        Noah had no ſooner ſinned,
but hee diſcouers his nakedneſſe,

&amp; hath not ſo much rule o
                           •
                         himſelf,
as to be aſhamed, one houres
drunkennes bewraies that which
more then 600. years ſobriety had
modeſtly concealed; he that giues
himſelf to wine, is not his owne:
what ſhall we thinke of this vice,
which robs a man of himſelfe, and
layes a beaſt in his roome? Noahs
nakednes is ſeene in wine, it is no
vnuſuall quality in this exceſſe, to
diſcloſe ſecrets; drunkennes doth
both make imperfections, &amp; ſhew
thoſe wee haue, to others eyes, ſo
would God haue it, that we might
be double aſham'd, both of thoſe
weakneſſes which we diſcouer, &amp;
of that weakenes which mooued
vs to diſcouer. Noah is vncouered;
but in the midſt of his owne
tent: It had beene ſinfull though

no man had ſeene it: vnknowne
ſins haue their guilt and ſhame,
and are iuſtly attended with
knowne puniſhments. Vngratious
Cham ſaw it and laughed, his
Fathers ſhame ſhould haue been
his; the deformity of thoſe parts
from which hee had his beeing;
ſhould haue begotten in him a
ſecret horror, and deiection, how
many graceleſſe men make ſport
at the cauſes of their humiliation.
Twiſe had Noah giuen him life,
yet neither the name of a Father,
and preſeruer, nor age, nor vertue
could ſhield him from the contempt
of his owne.
                     I ſee that euen Gods Arke may
nouriſh monſters▪ ſome filthy
toades may lie vnder the ſtones

of the Temple, God preſerues
ſome men in iudgement, better
had it beene for Cham to haue periſhed
in the waters, then to liue
vnto his Fathers curſe. Not content
to be a witneſſe of this filthy
ſight; he goes on to bee a proclaimer
of it. Sinne doth ill in the eye
but worſe in the tongue: As all ſin
is a work of darkenes, ſo it ſhould
bee buried in darkeneſſe. The report
of ſin is oft-times as ill, as the
commiſsion; for it can neuer bee
blazoned without vncharitableneſſe;
ſeldome without infection;
Oh the vnnaturall and more then
Chammiſh impiety of thoſe ſons
which reioyce to publiſh the nakedneſſe
of their ſpirituall parents
euen to their enemies.
                     Yet it was well for Noah that

                        Cham could tell it to none but his
owne; and thoſe, gracious and
dutifull ſonnes. Our ſhame is the
leſſe if none know our faults but
our friends. Behold how loue couereth
ſinnes, theſe good ſonnes
are ſo farre from going forward
to ſee their fathers ſhame, that
they goe backeward to hide it,
The cloake is laide on both their
ſhoulders, they both go back with
quall paces, and dare not ſo much
as looke backe leſt they ſhould
vnwillingly ſee the cauſe of their
ſhame, and will rather aduenture
to ſtumble at their fathers body
then to ſee his nakedneſſe: How
did it greeue them to thinke that
they which had ſo oft come to
their holy father with reuerence
muſt now in reuerence turn their

backes vpon him; and that they
muſt now cloath him in pitty,
which had ſo often clothed them
in loue: And which addes more
to their duty, they couered him,
and ſaide nothing. This modeſt
ſorrow is their praiſe, and our example;
The ſins of thoſe wee loue
and honor, we muſt heare of with
indignation; fearfully and vnwillingly
beleeue, acknowledge with
griefe and ſhame, hide with honeſt
excuſes, and bury in ſilence.
                     How equal a regard is this both
of piety and diſobedience? becauſe
Cham ſinned againſt his Father,
therfore he ſhall be plagued
in his children; Iapheth is dutifull
to his Father, and finds it in his

poſterity. Becauſe Cham was an ill
ſonne to his Father, therefore his
ſonnes ſhall be ſeruans to his brethren,
becauſe Iapheth ſet his ſhoulder
to Sems, to beare the cloake of
ſhame, therfore ſhall Iapheth dwel
in the tents of Sem; partaking with
him in bleſsing, as in duty. When
we doe but what wee ought; yet
God is thankefull to vs; and rewards
that which wee ſhould ſin
if we did not: who could euer yet
ſhew mee a man rebelliouſly vndutifull
to his parents that hath
proſpered in himſelfe, and his
ſeed?
                  
                  
                     
                     Babel.
                     HOW ſoone are men and ſins
multiplied? within one hundred
yeeres the world is as full of
both, as if there had beene no deluge.
Though men could not but
ſee the fearefull monuments of
the ruine of their Anceſtors, yet
how quickly had they forgotten
a floud? Good Noah liued to ſee
the world both populous, and
wicked again. And doubtles oft-times
repented to haue beene the
preſeruer of ſome whom hee ſaw
to traduce the vices of the former
world, to the renewed: It
could not but grieue him to ſee
the deſtroyed giants reuiue out

of his own loyns, and to ſee them
of his fleſh and bloud tiranniſe ouer
themſelues. In his ſight Nimrod
caſting off the awe of his holy
grandfather, grew imperious and
cruell, and made his owne kinſmen
ſeruants. How eaſie a thing
it is for a great ſpirit to bee the
head of a faction; when euen brethren
will ſtoop to ſeruitude; And
now when men are combined together,
euill and preſumptuous
motions finde incouragement in
multitudes; and each man takes a
pride in ſeeming forwardeſt, wee
are the cheerfuller in good when
wee haue the aſsiſtance of company,
much more in ſinning, by
how much we are more prone to
euill then good. It was a proud
word (Come let vs build vs a citie

and a towre whoſe top may
reach to heauen.)
                     They were newly come down
from the hils vnto the plains, and
now thinke of raiſing vp an hill
of building in the plaine, when
their tents were pitched vpon the
mountains of Armenia they were
as neere to Heauen as their towre
could make them; but their ambition
muſt needs aſpire to an
height of their owne raiſing. Pride
is euer diſcontented; and ſtil ſeeks
matter of boaſting in her owne
workes.
                     How fondly doe men reckon
without God, Come let vs build;
As if there had beene no ſtop but
in their own will: As if both earth

and time had beene theirs: Still
doe all naturall men build Babell;
forecaſting their owne plots ſo
reſolutely, as if there were no power
to countermand them: It is
iuſt with God that peremptory
determinations ſeldome proſper:
Whereas thoſe things which are
fearefully and modeſtly vndertaken,
commonly ſucceed.
                     Let vs build vs a city, if they had
taken God with them it had bin
commendable, eſtabliſhing of ſocieties
is pleaſing to him that is
the God of order: But a towre
whoſe top may reach to Heauen,
was a ſhameful arrogance, an impious
preſumption; who would
thinke that wee little Ants that
creepe vpon this earth ſhould

thinke of climbing vp to heauen,
by multiplying of earth?
                     Pride euer looks at higheſt, the
firſt man would know as God,
theſe would dwell as God; couetouſneſneſſe
and ambition know
no limits. And what if they had
reacht vp to heauen, ſome hils
are as high as they could hope to
be, and yet are no whit the better;
no place alters the condition of
nature, an Angell is glorious,
though hee bee vpon earth; and
man is but earth though he be aboue
the clouds: The neerer they
had beene to heauen the more
ſubiect ſhould they haue been to
the violences of heauen; to thunders,
lightnings, and thoſe other
higher inflammations, what had

beene but to thruſt themſelues
into the hands of the reuenger of
all wicked inſolences? God loues
that heauen ſhould bee lookt at,
and affected with all humble deſires,
with the holy ambitions of
faith, not with the proud imaginations
of our owne atchieuements.
                     But wherefore was all this? Not
that they loued ſo much to bee
neighbours to heauen, as to be famous
vpon earth; It was not commodity
that was heere ſought,
not ſafety, but glory: whither
doth not thirſt of fame cary men?
whether in good or euil: It makes
them ſeek to climbe to heauen, it
makes them not fear to run down
headlong to hell: Euen in the beſt
things deſire of praiſe ſtands in

competition with conſcience, and
brags to haue the more clients.
One builds a Temple to Diana in
hope of glory, intending it for
one of the great wonders of the
world; another in hope of fame
burnes it. Hee is a rare man that
hath not ſome Babel of his owne,
whereon he beſtowes paines and
coſt, onely to be talked of. If they
had done better things in a vain-glorious
purpoſe; their act had
beene accurſed; if they had built
houſes to God, if they had giuen
almes to men, if they had ſacrificed,
prayed, liued well; the intent
poiſons the action; but now both
the act and the purpoſe are equally
vain, and the iſſue is as vain
as either.
                     God hath a ſpeciall indignation

at pride aboue all ſins, and wil
croſſe our endeuours not for that
they are euil (what hurt could be
in laying one bricke vppon another?)
but for that they are proudly
vndertaken: Hee could haue
hindered the laying of the firſt
ſtone; and might as eaſily haue
made the trench for the foundation,
the graue of the builders:
But hee loues to ſee what wicked
men would doe; and to let
fooles runne themſelues out of
breath; what monument ſhould
they haue had of their own madneſſe,
and his powerfull interruption,
if the walls had riſen to no
height? To ſtop them then in the
midſt of their courſe, he meddles
not with either their hands, or
their feet, but their tongues; not

by pulling them out, not by looſing
their ſtrings, not by making
them ſay nothing, but by teching
them to ſay too much: Here is nothing
varied but the ſound of letters,
euen this fruſtrates the work,
and befooles the workmen: How
eaſie is it for God tenne thouſand
waies to correct and foreſtall the
greateſt proiects of men? Hee
that taught Adam the firſt words,
taught them words that neuer
were. One cals for bricke, the other
looks him in the face, and
wonders what hee commands,
and how and why he ſpeaks ſuch
words, as were neuer heard, and
in ſtead thereof brings him morter,
returning him an anſwer as
little vnderſtood, ech chides with
other, expreſsing his choler ſo, as

hee onely can vnderſtand himſelfe:
From heat they fall to quiet
intreaties, but ſtill with the ſame
ſucceſſe. At firſt euery man thinks
his fellow mocks him, but now
perceiuing this ſerious confuſion
their onely anſwere was ſilence,
and ceaſing; they could not come
together, for no man could call
them to be vnderſtood; &amp; if they
had aſſembled nothing could be
determined, becauſe one could
neuer attaine to the others purpoſe:
No, they could not haue
the honour of a generall diſmiſsion,
but each man leaues his trowell
and ſtation more like a foole
then hee vndertooke it, ſo commonly
actions begun in glory,
ſhut vp in ſhame. All externall
actions depend vpon the tongue,

No man can know others mind,
if this bee not the interpreter;
hence as there were many toungs
giuen to ſtay the building of Babel,
ſo there were as many giuen
to build the new Ieruſalem, the
Euangelicall Church. How deare
hath Babel coſt all the world? At
the firſt when there was but one
language, men did ſpend their
time in Arts; (ſo was it requiſit at
the firſt ſetling of the world, and
ſo came early to perfection) but
now we ſtay ſo long (of neceſsity)
vpon the ſhel of tongues, that
we can hardly haue time to chew
the ſweet kernell of knowledge:
Surely men would haue growne
too proud if there had beene no
Babel: It fals out oft-times that
one ſinne is a remedy of a greater.

Diuiſion of tongues muſt needs
ſlacken any worke: Multiplicitie
of language had not bin giuen by
the Holy ghoſt for a bleſsing to
the Church, if the world had not
beene before poſſeſſed with multiplicitie
of languages, for a puniſhment:
Hence it is that the
building of our Sion riſes no faſter,
becauſe our tongues are diuided;
Happy were the Church
of God if we al ſpake but one language:
Whiles wee differ, wee can
build nothing but Babel; difference
of tongues cauſed their Babel
to ceaſe, but it builds ours.
                  
                  
                     
                     Abraham.
                     IT was fit that he which ſhould
be the father and pattern of the
faithful ſhold be throughly tried
for in a ſet copie euery fault is important,
and may proue a rule of
error: of ten trials which Abraham
paſſed; the laſt was the ſoreſt: No
ſonne of Abraham can hope to eſcape
temptations, while hee ſees
that boſome in which hee deſires
to reſt, ſo aſſaulted with difficulties.
Abraham muſt leaue his countrey
and kinred, and liue among
ſtrangers; The calling of God neuer
leaues men, where it finds
them, the earth is the Lords; and
all places are alike to the wiſe and

faithfull: If Chaldea had not been
groſſely idolatrous; Abraham had
not left it; no bond muſt tie vs to
the danger of infection:
                     But whether muſt he go? To a
place he knew not, to men that
knew not him: it is enough comfort
to a good man, whereſoeuer
he is, that hee is acquainted with
God, we are neuer out of our way
while wee follow the calling of
God. Neuer any man loſt by his
obedience to the higheſt: becauſe
Abraham yeelded, God giues him
the poſſeſsion of Canaan: I wonder
more at his faith in taking this
poſſeſsion, then in leauing his
owne; Beholde Abraham takes
poſſeſsion for that ſeed which he
had not; which in nature hee was

not like to haue; of that land wherof
hee ſhould not haue one foot,
wherein his ſeede ſhould not bee
ſetled of almoſt fiue hundred
yeres after, the power of faith can
preuent time; and make future
things preſent; If wee be the true
ſonnes of Abraham we haue already
(while wee ſoiourne heere on
earth) the poſſeſsion of our land
of promiſe: while wee ſeeke our
country, we haue it.
                     Yet euen Canaan doth not affoord
him bread, which yet hee
muſt beleeue ſhall flow with milk
and hony to his ſeede: ſenſe muſt
yeeld to faith, wo were vs, if wee
muſt iudge of our future eſtate by
the preſent, Aegypt giues releefe
to Abraham, when Canaan cannot

In outward things Gods enemies
may fare better, then his friends:
Thriſe had Aegypt preſerued the
Church of God, in Abraham, in
Iaacob, in Chriſt; God oft-times
makes vſe of the world for the behoofe
of his; though without
their thanks; as contrarily, he vſes
the wicked for ſcourges to his
own inheritance, and burns them;
becauſe in his good they intended
euill.
                     But what a change is this? Hitherto
hath Sarah bene Abrahams
wife, now AEpypt hath made her
his ſiſter; feare hath turned him
from an husband to a brother;
No ſtrength of faith can exclude
ſome doubtings: God hath ſaid, I
will make thee a great nation, Abraham
                        
ſaith, The Egyptians will
kill me: He that liued by his faith,
yet ſhrinketh, and ſinneth. How
vainely ſhall we hope to beleeue
without al feare, and to liue without
infirmities? Some little aſperſions
of vnbeleefe cannot hinder
the praiſe and power of faith; Abraham
beleeued, and it was imputed
to him for righteouſneſſe;
Hee that through inconſiderateneſſe
doubted twiſe of his owne
life, doubts not of the life of his
ſeed, euen from the dead and dry
wombe of Sarah, yet was it more
difficult that his poſterity ſhould
Sarah, then that Sarahs husband
ſhould liue in AEgypt: This was
aboue nature, yet he beleeues it;
Sometimes the beleeuer ſtickes
at eaſie tryalls, and yet breakes

through the greateſt temptations
without feare: Abraham was olde
ere this promiſe and hope of a
ſonne; and ſtil the older, the more
vncapable; yet God makes him
wait twenty fiue yeares for performance,
no time is long to faith
which hath learned to differre
hopes without fainting and irkeſomneſſe.
                     
                        Abraham heard this newes from
the Angell, and laughed, Sarah
heard it, and laughed; they did
not more agree in their deſire,
then differ in their affection; Abraham
laughed for ioy; Sarah for
diſtruſt, Abraham laughed becauſe
he beleeued it would be ſo; Sarah
becauſe ſhe beleeued it could not
be: the ſame act varies in the manner

of doing, and the intention of
the doer, yet Sarah laught but
within her ſelfe and is bewraied:
How God can find vs out in ſecret
ſins; how eaſily did ſhe now
think, that he which could know
of her inward laughter, could
know of her conception, and
now ſhe that laughed and beleeued
not, beleeueth and feareth.
                     What a liuely patterne doe I
ſee in Abraham &amp; Sarah, of a ſtrong
faith and weake, of ſtrong in Abraham
and weake in Sarah: Shee
to make God good of his worde
to Abraham, knowing her owne
barrenneſſe, ſubſtitutes an Hagar,
and in an ambition of ſeed, perſwades
to Poligamy. Abraham
had neuer looked to obtaine the

promiſe by any other then a barren
wombe, if his owne wife had
not importunde him to take another:
when our owne apparent
meanes faile, weake faith is put to
ſhifts; and proiects ſtrange deuiſes
of her owne to attaine her end.
She will rather conceiue by another
wombe then bee childleſſe:
when ſhe heares of an impoſsibility
to nature, ſhe doubreth, and
yet hides her diffidence; and when
ſhe muſt beleeue, feareth, becauſe
ſhe did diſtruſt: Abraham heares
and beleeues and expects and reioyces;
he ſaith not, I am old and
weake; Sarah is olde and barren,
where are the many nations that
ſhall come from theſe withered
loynes? It is enough to him that
God hath ſaid it, he ſees not the

meanes, he ſees the promiſe. He
knew that God would rather
raiſe him vp ſeede from the very
ſtones that hee trod vpon, then
himſelfe ſhould want a large and
happy iſſue.
                     There is no faith where there
is neither meanes or hopes. Difficulties
and impoſsibilities are the
true obiects of beleefe: Hereupon
God ads to his name that which
he would fetch from his loynes,
and made his name as ample as
his poſterity: neuer any man was
a looſer by beleeuing: Faith is euer
recompenſed with glory.
                     Neither is Abraham content
only to wait for God, but to ſmart
for him; God bids him cut his

owne fleſh; he willingly ſacrifices
this parcell of his skin and blood,
to him that was the owner of all:
How glad he is to carry this painfull
marke of the loue of his creator.
How forward to ſeale this couenant
with blood betwixt God
and him, not regarding the ſoreneſſe
of his body in compariſon
of the confirmation of his ſoule;
The wound was not ſo grieuous
as the ſignification was comfortable.
For herein hee ſaw that from
his loynes ſhould come that bleſſed
ſeed which ſhould purge his
ſoule from all corruption: well is
that part of vs loſt, which may
giue aſſurance of the ſaluation of
the whole; our faith is not yet
ſound, if it haue not taught vs to
neglect paine for God, and more

to loue his Sacraments, then our
owne fleſh.
                  
                  
                     Iſaac ſacrificed.
                     BVt all theſe are but eaſie tasks
of faith, all ages haue ſtood amazed
at the next: Not knowing
whether they ſhould more wonder
at Gods command, or Abrahams
obedience, many yeeres had
that good Patriarch waited for
his Iſaac; now at laſt hee hath ioyfully
receiued him, and that with
this gratious acclamation. In Iſaac
ſhall thy ſeed bee called, and all nations
bleſſed. Behold the ſon of his age,
the ſon of his loue, the ſon of his

expectation, hee that might not
indure a mocke from his brother,
muſt now indure the knife of his
Father; Take thine onely ſonne Iſaac
whome thou loueſt and get thee to the
land of Moriah and offer him there for
a burnt offering.
                     
                     Neuer any gold was tried in ſo
hot a fire. Who but Abraham
would not haue expoſtulated
with God? What? Doth the
God of mercies now beginne to
delight in blood? Is it poſſible
that murder ſhould become pietie?
Or if thou wilt needes take
pleaſure in an humane ſacrifice,
is there none but Iſaac fit for thine
Altar, none but Abraham to offer
him? Shall theſe hands deſtroy
the fruit of mine owne loines?
Can I not be faithfull vnleſſe I be

vnnaturall? Or if I muſt needes
be the monſter of all parents, will
not Iſmael yet bee accepted? O
God where is thy mercie, where
is thy iuſtice? Haſt thou giuen
me but one only ſonne, and muſt
I now ſlay him? Why did I wait
ſo long for him? Why didſt thou
giue him me? Why didſt thou
promiſe mee a bleſsing in him?
What will the heathen ſay when
they ſhall heare of this infamous
maſſacre? How can thy name,
and my profeſſion eſcape a perpetuall
blaſphemie? With what
face ſhall I looke vpon my wife
Sarah, whoſe ſonne I haue murdered▪
How ſhall ſhee intertaine
the executioner of Iſaac? Or who
will beleeue that I did this from
thee? How ſhall not all the world

ſpit at his holy cruelty, and ſay
there goes the man that cut the
throat of his owne ſon. Yet if hee
were an vngratious or rebellious
child, his deſerts might giue ſome
colour to this violence, but to lay
hands on ſo deare, ſo dutifull, ſo
hopefull a ſonne, is vncapable of
all pretences.
                     But grant that thou which art
the God of nature maiſt either alter
or neglect it, what ſhall I ſay
to the truth of thy promiſes? Can
thy iuſtice admit contradictions;
can thy decrees be changeable,
canſt thou promiſe &amp; diſappoint?
Can theſe two ſtand together, Iſaac
ſhall liue to bee the father of
nations; and Iſaac ſhall now dye
by the hand of his Father? when

                        Iſaac is once gone where is my
ſeed, where is my bleſsing? O God
if thy commands and purpoſes
be capable of alteration, alter this
bloody ſentence, and let thy firſt
word ſtand.
                     Theſe would haue beene the
thoughts of a weake heart, But
God knew that he ſpake to an Abraham,
and Abraham knew that he
had to doe with a God: Faith had
taught him not to argue, but obey;
In an holy wilfulneſſe hee
either forgets nature, or deſpiſes
her, hee is ſure that what God
commands is good, that what he
promiſes, is infallible, and therefore
is careleſſe of the means, and
truſts to the end.
                     In matters of God, whoſoeuer

conſults with fleſh and blood
ſhall neuer offer vp his Iſaac, to
God, there needs no counſellor
when we know God is the commander;
here is neither grudging
nor deliberating, nor delaying:
His faith would not ſuffer him ſo
much as to be ſorry for that hee
muſt do. Sarah her ſelfe may not
know of Gods charge, and her
husbands purpoſe, leſt her affection
ſhould haue ouercome her
faith; leſt her weakeneſſe now
grown importunat, ſhould haue
ſaid, Diſobey God any die. That
which he muſt do, he will do, he
that hath learned not to regarde
the life of his ſon, had lerned not
to regard the ſorrow of his wiſe.
It is too much tenderneſſe to reſpect
the cenſures and conſtructions

of others, when we haue a direct
word from God. The good
Patriarch riſes early, and addreſſes
himſelfe to his ſad iourney. And
now muſt he trauell three whole
daies to do this execution, and ſtil
muſt Iſaac be in his eye, whom all
this while hee ſeemes to ſee bleeding
vppon the pile of wood,
which he carries; there is nothing
ſo miſerable as to dwell vnder the
expectation of a great euill; That
miſery which muſt be, is mitigated
with ſpeed, and aggrauated
with delay: All this while if Abraham
had repented him, hee had
leiſure to returne. There is no
ſmall triall, euen in the very time
of tryall: now when they are
come within ſight of the choſen
mountaine, the ſeruants are diſmiſſed,

what a deuotion is this
that will abide no witneſſes, hee
will not ſuffer two of his owne
vaſſals to ſee him do that, which
ſoon after al the world muſt know
he hath done, yet is not Abraham
afraid of that piety, which the beholders
could not ſee without
horror, without reſiſtance, which
no eare could heare of without
abhomination. What ſtranger
could haue indured to ſee the father
carry the knife and fire, inſtruments
of that death, which he
had rather ſuffer then inflict? The
ſon ſecurely carrying that burden
which muſt carry him.
                     But if Abrahams hart could haue
knowne how to relent, that queſtion
of his deere, innocent and

religious ſon had melted it into
compaſsion, My father, behold
the fire and the wood, but
where is the ſacrifice? I know not
whether that word, My Father,
did not ſtrike Abraham as deep, as
the knife of Abraham could ſtrike
his ſon: yet doth he not ſo much
as thinke, (O miſerable man that
may not at once bee a ſonne to
ſuch a God, and a father to ſuch
a ſonne:) Still he perſiſts, and conceales,
and where he meant not,
propheſies, My ſonne, God ſhall
prouide a lamb for the burnt offering:
                     The heauy tidings was loath
to come foorth, It was a death to
Abraham to ſay what he muſt doe:
Hee knows his owne faith to act

this, he knows not Iſaacs to indure
it, But now when Iſaac hath helped
to build the Altar, whereon
he muſt be conſumed; hee heares
(not without aſtoniſhment) the
ſtrange command of God, the finall
will of his Father: My ſonne
thou art the lambe which God
hath prouided for this burnt offering;
If my blood would haue
excuſed thee, how many thouſand
times had I rather to giue
thee my own life, then take thine
Alas I am full of daies, and now of
long liued not but in thee; Thou
mighteſt haue preſerued the life
of thy father and haue comforted
his death, but the God of vs both
hath choſen thee; Hee that gaue
thee vnto mee miraculouſly, bids
me by an vnuſuall meanes to returne

thee vnto him. I neede not
tell thee, that I ſacrifice all my
worldly ioyes, yea and my ſelfe in
thee, but God muſt bee obeyed;
neither art thou too deere for
him that calls thee: come on my
ſon, reſtore the life that God hath
giuen thee by mee: offer thy ſelfe
willingly to thoſe flames, ſend vp
thy ſoule cheerefully vnto thy
glorie; and know that God loues
thee aboue others, ſince hee requires
thee alone to be conſecrated
in ſacrifice to himſelfe.
                     Who cannot imagine with
what perplexed mixtures of paſſions,
with what changes of countenance,
what doubts, what fears,
what amazement good Iſaac receiued
this ſudden meſſage from

the mouth of his Father, how hee
queſtioned, how he pleaded; but
when hee had ſomwhat digeſted
his thoughts, and conſidered that
the Author was God, the actor
Abraham, the action a ſacrifice, he
now approoues himſelfe the ſon
of Abraham; now hee incourages
the trembling hands of his Father;
with whom he ſtriues in this
praiſe of forwardnes, and obedience;
now he offers his hands and
feet to the cords, his throat to the
knife, his body to the altar; and
growing ambitious of the ſword
and fire, intreates his father to do
that, which he would haue done
though hee had diſſwaded him;
O holy emulation of faith! O
bleſſed agreement of the ſacrificer,
and oblation: Abraham is as

ready to take, as Iſaac to giue, He
binds thoſe deare hands which
are more ſtraitly bound with the
cords of duty, and reſolution; hee
laies his ſacrifice vpon the wood,
which now before hand burnt inwardly
with the heauenly fire of
zeale and deuotion.
                     And now hauing kiſſed him
his laſt, not without mutual tears,
hee lifts vp his hand to fetch the
ſtroke of death at once; not ſo
much as thinking, perhaps God
will relent after the firſt wound;
Now the ſtay of Abraham, the
hope of the Church lies on bleeding
vnder the hand of a Father,
what bowells can chooſe but
yearne at this ſpectacle; which of
the ſauageſt heathens that had

beene now vpon the hill of Moriah,
and had ſeene through the
buſhes the ſword of a father hanging
ouer the throat of ſuch a ſon
would not haue beene more perplexed
in his thoughts, then that
vnexpected ſacrifice was in thoſe
briers: yet hee whom it neereſt
concerned, is leaſt touched, Faith
hath wrought the ſame in him,
which cruelty would in others,
not to be moued; Hee contemns
all feares, and ouerlooks all impoſsibilities;
His heart tells him
that the ſame hand which raiſed
Iſaac from the dead womb of Sarah,
can raiſe him again from the
aſhes of his ſacrifice: with this
confidence was the hand of Abraham
now falling vppon the
throat of Iſaac who had giuen

himſelfe for dead, and reioyced in
the change; when ſuddenly the
Angel of God interrupts him,
forbids him, commends him.
                     The voice of God was neuer ſo
welcome, neuer ſo ſweet, neuer ſo
ſeaſonable as now: It was the triall
that God intended, not the
fact; Iſaac is ſacrificed, and is yet aliue,
and now both of them are
more happy in that they would
haue done, then they could haue
beene diſtreſſed if they had done
it. Gods charges are oft times
harſh in the beginnings, and proceeding,
but in the concluſion alwaies
comfortable: True ſpirituall
comforts are commonly late
and ſudden: God differr's on purpoſe
that our trials may bee perfect,

our deliuerance welcome,
our recompence glorious: Iſaac
had neuer beene ſo pretious to
his father if he had not beene recouered
from death; if he had not
beene as miraculouſly reſtored
as giuen: Abraham had neuer bin
ſo bleſſed in his ſeed, if hee had
not neglected Iſaac for God.
                     The only way to find comfort
in any earthly thing is to ſurrender
it (in a faithfull careleſneſſe)
into the hands of God: Abraham
came to ſacrifice, he may not goe
away with drye hands: God cannot
abide that good purpoſes
ſhould be fruſtrate: leſt either he
ſhould do that, for which he came
or ſhould want meanes of ſpeedy
thankeſgiuing for ſo gratious a

appointment. Beholde a Ram
ſtands ready for the ſacrifice, and
as it were, proffers himſelfe to this
happy exchange. Hee that made
that beaſt, brings him thither, faſtens
him there: Euen in ſmall
things there is a great prouidence
what miſteries there are in euery
act of God? The onely ſonne of
God vpon this very hill, is laid vpon
the altar of the croſſe; and ſo
becomes a true ſacrifice for the
world, that yet hee is raiſed without
impeachment, and exempted
from the power of death: The
Lambe of God which takes the
ſinnes of the world is heere really
offered, and accepted: One Sauiour
in two figures; in the one, dying;
reſtored in the other. So Abraham
whiles hee exerciſes his

faith, confirmes it; and reioyces
more to foreſee the true Iſaac in
that place offered to death for his
ſinnes, then to ſee the carnal Iſaac
preſerued from death for the reward
of his faith. Whatſoeuer is
deareſt to vs vpon earth is our Iſaac;
happy are wee if we can ſacrifice
it to God; thoſe ſhall neuer
reſt with Abraham that cannot
ſacrifice with Abraham.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     Lot and Sodome.
                     BEfore Abraham and Lot grewe
riche, they dwelt together;
now their wealth ſeparates them;
Their ſociety was a greater good
then their riches: Many a one is
a looſer by his wealth; Who
would account thoſe things good
which make vs worſe? It had bin
the duty of yong Lot to offer rather
then to chooſe; to yeeld rather
then contend: who would
not heere thinke Abraham the nephew;
and Lot the vncle? It is no
diſparagement for greater perſons
to beginne treaties of peace.
Better doth it beſeeme euery ſon
of Abraham to win with loue, then

to ſway with power. Abraham
yeelds ouer this right of his
choice; Lot takes it, And behold
Lot is croſſed in that which hee
choſe, Abraham is bleſſed in that
which was left him, God neuer
ſuffers any man to leeſe by an
humble remiſſion of his right in
a deſire of peace.
                     Wealth hath made Lot not only
vndutifull, but couetous, hee
ſees the goodly plains of Iordan,
the richneſſe of the ſoyle, the
commodity of the riuers, the ſituation
of the cities, and now not
once inquiring into the conditions
of the inhabitants, hee is in
loue with Sodome: Outward appearances
are deceitfull guides to
our iudgment, or affections: they

are worthie to bee deceiued that
value things as they ſeeme: It is
not long after that Lot paies deere
for his raſhneſſe. He fled for quietneſſe
with his vncle and fiends
warre with ſtrangers: Now is hee
carried priſoner with all his ſubſtance
by great enemies; Abraham
muſt reſcue him, of whom hee
was forſaken. That wealth which
was the cauſe of his former quarrels,
is made a pray to mercileſſe
heathens. That place which his
eye couetouſly choſe betraies his
life and goods. How many Chriſtians
whiles they haue looked at
gaine, haue loſt themſelues?
                     Yet this ill ſucceſſe hath neither
driuen out Lot, nor amended
Sodome; he ſtill loues his commodity,

and the Sodomites their ſins
wicked men grow worſe with afflictions,
as water grows more
cold after an heate: And as they
leaue not ſinning, ſo God leaues
not plaguing them, but ſtill followes
them with ſucceſsion of
iudgements: In how few yeares
hath Sodome forgot ſhe was ſpoiled,
and led captiue? If that wicked
city had beene warned by the
ſword, it had eſcaped the fire; but
now this viſitation had not made
ten good men in thoſe fiue cities:
How fit was this heape for the
fire, which was all chaffe? Onely
Lot vexed his righteous ſoul with
the ſight of their vncleanneſſe;
He vexed his owne ſoule, for who
bad him ſtay there? yet becauſe he
was vexed, he is deliuered. He eſcapeth

their iudgment, for whoſe
ſinnes hee eſcaped. Though hee
would be a gueſt of Sodome, yet becauſe
hee would not entertaine
their ſinnes, hee becomes an hoſt
to the Angels: Euen the good
Angels are the executioners of
Gods iudgement: There cannot
bee a better or more noble act
then to do iuſtice vpon obſtinate
malefactors.
                     Who can be aſhamed of that
which did not miſ-beſeem the very
Angels of God? Where ſhould
the Angels lodge but with Lot,
the houſes of holy men are full of
theſe heauenly ſpirits, when they
know not, they pitch their tents
in ours, and viſit vs when wee ſee
not, and when we feele not, protect

vs; It is the honour of Gods
Saints to be attended by Angels:
The filthy Sodomites now flocke
together, ſtirred vp with the fury
of Enuie, and luſt, and dare require
to doe that in troups which
to act ſingle, had beene too abhominable,
to imagine, vnnaturall.
Continuance and ſociety in euill
makes wicked men outragious
and impudent: It is not enough
for Lot to be the witneſſe; but hee
muſt bee the baud alſo. (Bring
forth theſe men that wee may know
them.
                     
                     Beholde euen the Sodomites
ſpeake modeſtly; though their
acts and intents bee villanous.
What a ſhame it is for thoſe
which profeſſe impurity of heart,

to ſpeake filthily? The good man
craues and pleades the lawes of
hoſpitality; and when hee ſees
headſtrong purpoſes of miſchiefe
chooſes rather to be an ill father;
then an ill hoſt: His intention was
good, but his offer was faulty; If
through his allowance the Sodomites
had defiled his daughters; it
had beene his ſinne; If through
violence they had defiled his
gueſts; it had beene onely theirs:
There can be no warrant for vs to
ſinne, leſt others ſhould ſinne: It
is for God to preuent ſinnes with
iudgement, it is not for men to
preuent a greater ſinne with a
leſſe: the beſt minds when they
are troubled; yeeld inconſiderate
motions, as water that is violently
ſtirred; ſends vp bubbles: God

meant better to Lot then to ſuffer
his weake offer to bee accepted:
Thoſe which are bent vpon villanie
are more exaſperated by diſſwaſion;
as ſome ſtrong ſtreames
when they are reſiſted by floodgates,
ſwell ouer the bankes.
                     Many a one is hardened by the
good word of God; and in ſteed
of receiuing the counſell, rages at
the meſſenger: When men are
growne to that paſſe, that they
are no whit better by afflictions,
and woorſe with admonitions,
God finds it time to ſtrike; Now
Lots gueſts begin to ſhew themſelues
Angels, and firſt deliuer
Lot in Sodome, then from Sodom:
Firſt ſtrike them with blindneſſe,
whom they will after conſume

with fire: How little did the Sodomites
thinke that vengeance
was ſo neere them, while they
went groping in the ſtreets, and
curſing thoſe whom they could
not finde, Lot with the Angels is
in ſecure light, and ſees them miſerable,
and foreſees them burning.
It is the vſe of God to blind
and beſot thoſe whom he means
to deſtroy: The light which they
ſhall ſee ſhall be fiery, which ſhall
be the beginning of an euerlaſting
darkneſſe, and a fire vnquenchable:
Now they haue done ſinning
and God begins to iudge: Wickedneſſe
hath but a time, the puniſhment
of wickednes is beyond
all time. The reſidue of the night
was both ſhort and dangerous.
Yet good Lot, though ſought for

by the Sodomites, and newly
puld into his houſe by the Angels
goes forth of his houſe to ſeek his
ſons in law: No good man would
bee ſaued alone; faith makes vs
charitable with neglect of all perill:
Hee warnes them like a Prophet,
and aduiſes them like a Father,
but both in vaine, he ſeemes
to them as if he mocked, and they
doe more then ſeeme to mocke
him again. Why ſhould to morrow
differ from other daies? Who
euer ſaw it raine fire? Or whence
ſhould that brimſtone come? Or
if ſuch ſhowers muſt fall, how
ſhall nothing burne but this valley?
So to carnall men preaching
is fooliſhneſſe, deuotion idlenes,
the Prophets mad men; Paul a
babler: Theſe mens incredulity is

as woorthy of the fire, as the others
vncleanneſſe. Hee that beleeues
not is condemned alreadie.
                     The meſſengers of God do not
onely haſten Lot, but pull him
by a gratious violence out of that
impure citie. They thirſted at
once after vengeance vpon Sodom
and Lots ſafetie; they knew God
could not ſtrike Sodome, till Lot
were gone out, and that Lot could
not be ſafe within thoſe wals. We
are all naturally in Sodome, if God
did not hale vs out, whiles we linger
wee ſhould bee condemned
with the world. If God meet with
a very good field, hee puls vp the
weeds, and lets the corne grow,
if indifferent, hee lets the corne

and weeds grow together; if very
ill, hee gathers the few eares of
corne, and burns the weeds.
                     Oh the large bounty of God
which reacheth not to vs onelie,
but to ours: God ſaues Lot for Abrahams
ſake, and Zoar for Lots
ſake; If Sodome had not beene too
wicked, it had eſcaped: Were it
not for Gods deere children that
are intermixed with the world it
could not ſtand: The wicked owe
their liues vnto theſe few good;
whom they hate and perſecute.
Now at once the Sunne riſes vpon
Zoar, and fire falls down vpon
Sodome: Abraham ſtands vpon the
hill and ſees the cities burning; It
is faire weather with Gods children,
when it is fouleſt with the

wicked. Thoſe which burned
with the fire of luſt, are now conſumed
with the fire of vengeance
They ſinned againſt nature, and
now againſt the courſe of nature;
fire deſcends from Heauen and
conſumes them: Lot may not ſo
much as looke at the flame, whether
for the ſtay of his paſſage, or
the horror of the ſight, or triall of
his faith; or feare of commiſeration.
Small precepts from God are
of importance, obedience is as
well tried, and diſobedience as
wel puniſhed in little, as in much:
His wife doth but turne back her
head, whether in curioſity, or vnbeleefe,
or loue, and compaſsion
of the place; ſhee is turned into a
monument of diſobedience; what
doth it auaile her not to bee turned

into aſhes in Sodom, when ſhe
is turned into a piller of ſalt in the
playne? He that ſaued a whole citie
cannot ſaue his own wife. God
cannot abide ſmal ſinnes, in thoſe
whom he hath obliged. If we diſpleaſe
him, God can as well meet
with vs out of Sodome: Lot now
come into Zoar maruels at the
ſtay of her, whom hee might not
before looke backe to call; &amp; ſoon
after returning to ſeeke her beholds
this change with wonder
and griefe: He finds ſalt in ſteede
of fleſh, a piller in ſteed of a wife;
he finds Sodome conſumed, and
her ſtanding, and is more amazed
with this, by how much it was
both more neere him, and leſſe
expected.
                     When God deliuers vs from deſtruction,

hee doth not ſecure vs
from all a
                           •
                        flictions: Lot hath loſt
his wife, his allies, his ſubſtance,
and now betakes himſelfe to an
vncomfortable ſolitarineſſe.
                     Yet though he fled from company,
he could not flye from ſin:
Hee who could not bee tainted
with vncleanneſſe in Sodome, is
ouertaken with drunkenneſſe
and inceſt in a caue: Rather then
Satan ſhal not want baits his own
daughters will proue Sodomites;
Thoſe which ſhould haue comforted,
betraied him: How little
are ſome hearts mooued with
iudgements? The aſhes of Sodome
and the piller of ſalt were not yet
out of their eye when they dare
thinke of lying with their owne

Father. They knew that whileſt
Lot was ſober hee could not bee
vnchaſt: Drunkenneſſe is the way
to all beſtiall affections, and acts.
Wine knows no difference either
of perſons or ſinnes: No doubt
Lot was afterwards aſhamed of
his inceſtuous ſeed, and now wiſhed
hee had come alone out of
Sodome; yet euen this vnnaturall
bed was bleſſed with increaſe; and
one of our Sauiours worthy Anceſtors
ſprung after from this
line. Gods election is not tied to
our meanes; neither are bleſsings
or curſes euer traduced; The chaſt
bedde of holy parents hath oft
times bred a monſtrous generation;
and contrarily God hath raiſed
ſometimes an holy ſeed from
the drunken bed of inceſt, or fornication;

It hath beene ſeene that
weighty eares of corne haue
growne, out of the compaſſe of
the tilled field: Thus will God
magnifie the freedom of his
owne choice: and let vs
know that wee are
not borne, but
made good.

                  TO THE RIGHT
Honourable, the LORD
DENNY Baron of Waltham
my ſingular good Patron:
All grace and
happineſſe.
                  
                     RIGHT Honourable, I
know, and in all humility
confeſſe, how weake my
diſcourſe is, and how vnworthy
of this diuine ſubiect which I
haue vndertaken, which if an Angell
from heauen ſhould ſay he could ſufficiently
comment vpon, I ſhould diſtruſt
him. Yet this let mee ſay, (without any
vaine boaſting) that theſe thoughts
(ſuch as they are) through the bleſsing

of God, I haue wouen out of my ſelfe, as
holding it (after our Sauiours rule) better
to giue then to receiue. It is eaſier to
heape together large volumes of others
labours, then to worke out leſſer of our
owne, and the ſuggeſtion of one new
thought is better then many repeated.
                  This part (which together with the
Author is yours) ſhall preſent to your
Lordſhip, the buſieſt of all the Patriarchs,
together with his trialls, and ſucceſſe:
wherein you ſhall ſee Eſau ſtripped
by fraud, of that which hee willingly
ſold, Iacobs hard aduentures for the
bleſsing, and no leſſe hard ſeruices for
his wiues and ſubſtance, his dangerous
encounters ending ioyfully, the rape of
his onely daughter ſeconded with the
trecherous murder of his ſons, Iudahs
wrong to Thamar repayd by his owne
vncleanneſſe: Ioſephs ſale, impriſonment,

honour, piety; The ſinne of his
brethren well beſtowed, well anſwered. I
ſo touch at the vſes of all theſe, as one
that know, it is eaſie to ſay more, and
impoſsible to ſay enough. God giue a
bleſsing to my endeuours, and a pardon
to my weakeneſſes; to your Lordſhip, an
increaſe of his graces, and perfection of
all happineſſe.
                  
                     Your Lordſhips humbly and
officiouſly deuoted

BOOKE.
                  
                     Jacob and Eſau.
                     
                        OF all the Patriarkes
none made ſo little
noyſe in the world as
Iſaac; none liued either
ſo priuately, or ſo innocently:
Neither know I whether hee
approued himſelfe a better ſon or
an husband. For the one; He gaue
himſelfe ouer to the knife of his
Father, and mourned three yeeres

for his mother; for the other hee
ſought not to any handmaids
bed, but in a chaſt forbearance reſerued
himſelfe for twenty yeares
ſpace, and praied. Rebecca was ſo
long barren, his praiers prooued
more effectuall then his ſeed. At
laſt ſhee conceiued, as if ſhee had
beene more then the daughter in
law to Sarah; whoſe ſonne was
giuen her, not out of the power
of nature, but of her Huſbands
faith; God is oft better
to vs then we would: Iſaac praies
for a ſon; God giues him two at
once: Now, ſhee is no leſſe troubled
with the ſtrife of the children
in her womb, then before
with the want of children: wee
know not when we are pleaſed;
that which wee deſire, oft-times

diſcontents vs more in the fruition;
wee are ready to complaine
both full and faſting. Before Rebecca
conceiued ſhee was at eaſe:
Before ſpirituall regeneration
there is all peace in the ſoule: No
ſooner is the new man formed in
vs, but the fleſh conflicts with the
ſpirit: There is no grace where is
no vnquietnes: Eſau alone would
not haue ſtriuen, nature will euer
agree with it ſelfe; Neuer any Rebecca
conceiued only an Eſau; or
was ſo happy as to conceiue none
but a Iacob; She muſt be the mother
of both, that ſhee may haue
both ioy and exerciſe. This ſtrife
began early; Euery true Iſraelite
begins his warre with his beeing.
How many actions which wee
know not of, are not without preſage

and ſignification? Theſe two
were the champions of two nations,
the field was their mothers
womb, their quarrell, precedency
and ſuperiority: Eſau got the right
of nature; Iacob of grace: yet that
there might be ſome pretence of
equality, leſt Eſau ſhould outrun
his brother into the world,
Iacob holds him faſt by the heele:
So his hand was borne before the
others foote: But becauſe Eſau is
ſome minutes the elder, that the
yonger might haue better claime
to that which God had promiſed
he buyes that, which he could not
winne: If either by ſtrife, or purchaſe,
or ſuit, we can attaine ſpirituall
bleſsings wee are happy: If
Iaacob had come forth firſt, he had
not knowne how much hee was

bound to God for the fauour of
his aduancement. There was neuer
any meate except the forbidden
fruit ſo deare bought, as this
broth of Iaacob; In both, the receiuer
and the eater is accurſed: Euery
true ſonne of Iſraell will bee
content to purchaſe ſpirituall fauours
with earthly; And that man
hath in him too much of the
blood of Eſau, which will not rather
dye then forgoe his birth-right.
But what hath careleſſe Eſau
loſt, if hauing ſold his birth-right,
he may obtain the bleſsing?
Or what hath Iaacob gained, if his
brothers veniſon may counteruaile
his pottage? Yet thus hath
old Iſaac decreed; who was now
not more blind in his eyes, then
in his affections: God had forewarned

him that the elder ſhould
ſerue the younger, yet Iſaac goes
about to bleſſe Eſau. It was not ſo
hard for Abraham to reconcile
Gods promiſe and Iſaacs ſacrifice,
as for Iſaac to reconcile the ſuperiority
of Iacob, with Eſaus benediction:
for Gods hand was in that,
in this none but his owne: The
deereſt of Gods ſaints haue beene
ſometimes tranſported with naturall
affections: He ſaw himſelfe
preferred to Iſmael, though the
elder; hee ſaw his father wilfully
forgetting nature at Gods commaund,
in binding him for ſacrifice;
He ſaw Eſau lewdly matched
with Heathens; and yet hee will
remember nothing, but Eſau is
my firſt borne; But how gracious
is God; that when we would, will

not let vs ſinne? And ſo orders
our actions, that we do not what
we will, but what we ought; That
God which had ordained the
Lordſhip to the yonger, will alſo
contriue for him the bleſſing;
what he will haue effected, ſhall
not want meanes: the mother
ſhall rather defeate the ſon, and
beguile the Father, then the Father
ſhall beguile the choſen ſon
of his bleſsing: what was Iacob
to Rebecca more then Eſau? or
what mother doth not more affect
the elder? But now God inclines
the loue of the mother to
the yonger againſt the cuſtom of
nature, becauſe the father loues
the elder, againſt the promiſe:
The affections of the parents are
diuided, that the promiſe might

bee fulfilled; Rebeccaes craft ſhall
anſwer Iſaacs partiality: Iſaac wold
vniuſtly turne Eſau into Iacob, Rebecca
doth as cunningly turne Iacob
into Eſau: her deſire was good,
her meanes were vnlawfull; God
doth oft times effect his iuſt will
by our weakeneſſes; yet neither
therby iuſtifying our infirmities;
nor blemiſhing his own actions.
Heere was nothing but counterſaiting
a fained perſon, a fained
name, fained veniſon, a fained anſwer,
&amp; yet behold a true bleſsing
but to the man, not to the means:
Thoſe were ſo vnſound, that Iacob
himſelf doth more fear their curſe
then hope for their ſucceſſe: Iſaac
was now both ſimple and olde,
yet if he had perceiued the fraud,
Iacob had beene more ſure of a

curſe, then he could be ſure, that
he ſhould not be perceiued; thoſe
which are plaine harted in themſelues,
are the bittereſt enemies to
deceipt in others: Rebecca preſuming
vpon the Oracle of God,
and her husbands ſimplicity, dare
bee his ſurety for the danger, his
counſeller for the carriage of the
buſines, his cook for the diet, yea
dreſſes both the meate and the
man: and now puts words into
his mouth, the diſh into his hand
the garments vpon his backe, the
goates haire vpon the open parts
of his body, and ſends him in
thus furniſhed for the bleſsing:
Standing no doubt at the dore, to
ſee how well her leſſon was learned,
how well her deuiſe ſucceeded.
And if olde Iſaac ſhould by

any of his ſenſes haue diſcerned
the guile; ſhe had ſoone ſtept in,
and vndertaken the blame, and
vrged him with that known will
of God concerning Iacobs dominion,
and Eſaus ſeruitude, which
either age or affection had made
him forget. And now ſhe wiſhes
ſhee could borrow Eſaus tongue
as well as his garments, that ſhee
might ſecurely deceiue all the
ſenſes of him, which had ſuffered
himſelfe more dangerouſly deceiued
with his affection: But this
is paſt her remedy: her ſon muſt
name himſelf Eſau with the voice
of Iacob. It is hard if our tongue
doe not bewray what we are, in
ſpight of our habit. This was enough
to worke Iſaac to a ſuſpition,
to an inquiry, not to an incredulity:

He that is good of himſelfe
will hardly beleeue euill of
another: And will rather diſtruſt
his owne ſenſes, then the fidelity
of thoſe he truſted: All the ſenſes
are ſet to examine; none ſticketh
at the iudgement but the eare; To
deceiue that, Iacob muſt ſecond
his diſſimulation with three lyes
at one breath: I am Eſau, as thou
badſt me, my veniſon: one ſin intertained
fetcheth in another, and
if it be forced to lodge alone, either
departeth, or dyeth: I loue
Iacobs bleſsing, but I hate his lye,
I would not doe that wilfully,
which Iacob did weakely, vppon
condition of a bleſsing: Hee that
pardoned his infirmity, would
curſe my obſtinateneſſe. Good Iſaac
ſets his hands to trie whether

his eares informed him aright; he
feeles the hands of him whoſe
voice hee ſuſpected: that honeſt
heart could not thinke that the
skin might more eaſily be counterfaited,
then the lungs: A ſmall
ſatisfaction contents thoſe whom
guiltines hath not made ſcrupulous:
Iſaac beleeues, and bleſſes
the yoonger ſon in the garments
of the elder: If our heauenly Father
ſmell vpon our backes the
ſauor of our elder brothers robes,
wee cannot depart from him vnbleſſed:
No ſooner is Iacob gone
away ful of the ioy of his bleſsing
then Eſau comes in, full of the
hope of the bleſsing: And now he
cannot repent him to haue ſolde
that in his hunger for pottage;
which in his pleaſure he ſhal buy

againe with veniſon: The hopes
of the wicked faile them when
they are at higheſt, whereas Gods
children find thoſe comforts in
extremity which they durſt not
expect. Now hee comes in blowing,
and ſweating for his reward,
and finds nothing but a repulſe:
Leud men when they think they
haue earned of God; and come
proudly to challenge fauour, receiue
no anſwere but who art
thou? Both the Father and the
Sonne wonder at each other, the
one with feare, the other with
griefe; Iſaac trembled, and Eſau
wept; the one vpon conſcience,
the other vpon enuye: Iſaacs hart
now told him that he ſhould not
haue purpoſed the bleſsing where
he did; and that it was due to him

vnto whom it was giuen, and not
purpoſed; hence he durſt not reuerſe
that which hee had done,
with Gods will, beſides his own:
For now he ſaw that he had done
vnwilling iuſtice: God will finde
both time and meanes to reclaim
his owne, to preuent their ſins, to
manifeſt and reforme their errors
who would haue looked for tears
from Eſau? Or who dare truſt
tears, when he ſees them fal from
ſo graceleſſe eyes? It was a good
word, Bleſſe mee alſo my father;
Euery miſcreant can wiſh himſelfe
well: No man would be miſerable
if it were enough to deſire
happineſſe: Why did he not rather
weep to his brother, for the
pottage, then to Iſaac for a bleſſing,
If hee had not then ſolde,

hee had not needed now to
begge: It is iuſt with God to
deny vs thoſe fauours which
wee were careleſſe in keeping,
and which wee vnder valewed
in inioying; Eſaus eares find
no place for Iſaacs repentance;
Except it were that he hath done
that by wile, which hee ſhould
haue done vpon duty. No motiue
can cauſe a good heart to repent
that he hath done wel; how happy
a thing it is to know the ſeaſons
of grace, and not to neglect
them; how deſperate to haue
known &amp; neglected them, theſe
teares were both late and falſe; the
teares of rage, of enuy, of carnall
deſire; worldly ſorrow cauſeth
death: yet whiles Eſau howles out
thus for a bleſsing, I hear him cry

out of his fathers ſtore (Haſt thou
but one bleſsing my father) of his
brothers ſubtlety (was hee not
rightly called Iacob?) I do not hear
him blame his owne deſerts; He
did not ſee, while his Father was
deceiued, and his brother crafty,
that God was iuſt, and himſelfe
vncapable, hee knew himſelfe
prophane, and yet claimes a bleſſing.
Thoſe that care not to pleaſe
God, yet care for the outward fauours
of God, and are ready to
murmur if they want them, as if
God were bound to them, and
they free. And yet ſo mercifull is
God, that hee hath ſecond bleſſings
for thoſe that loue him not,
and giues them all they care for.
That one bleſsing of ſpeciall loue
is for none but Iſraell; but thoſe

of common kindnes are for them
that can ſell their birth-right:
This bleſsing was more then Eſau
could be worthy of, yet like a ſecond
Cain, hee reſolues to kill his
brother, becauſe he was more accepted,
I know not whether hee
were a worſe ſon, or brother; He
hopes for his fathers death, and
purpoſes his brothers; and vowes
to ſhed blood in ſteed of teares.
But wicked men cannot bee ſo ill
as they would; that ſtrong wreſtler
againſt whom Iacob preuailed,
preuailed with Eſau, and turned
his wounds into kiſſes; an hoſt of
men came with Eſau; an army of
Angels met Iacob, Eſau threatned,
Iacob prayed, His prayers, and preſents
haue melted the heart of Eſau
into loue. And now in ſteed

of the grimme and ſterne countenance
of an executioner, Iacob
ſees the face of Eſau, as the face of
God. Both men and diuels are
ſtinted, the ſtouteſt heart cannot
ſtand out againſt God, Hee that
can wreſtle earneſtly with God,
is ſecure from the harmes of men.
Thoſe minds which are exaſperated
with violence, and cannot
be broken with fear, yet are bowed
with loue; when the waies of
a man pleaſe God, hee will make
his enemies at peace with him.
                  
                  
                     
                     Jacob and Laban.
                     ISAACS life was not more retyred
and quiet, then Iacobs was
buſie and troubleſom. In the one
I ſee the image of contemplation,
of action in the other. None of
the Patriarchs ſaw ſo euill daies
as he; from whom iuſtly hath the
Church of God therefore taken
her name. Neither were the faithfull
euer ſince called Abrahamites,
but Iſraelites: that no time might
be loſt, hee began his ſtrife in the
womb; after that, hee flies for his
life from a cruel brother to a cruell
vncle. With a ſtaffe goes hee
ouer Iorden alone; doubtfull and
comfortleſſe, not like the ſonne

of Iſaac. In the way the earth is
his bed, and the ſtone his pillow;
Yet euen there he ſees a viſion of
Angels: Iacobs heart was neuer ſo
full of ioy, as when his head lay
hardeſt. God is moſt preſent with
vs in our greateſt deiection, and
loues to giue comfort to thoſe
that are forſaken of their hopes.
                     He came farre to finde out an
hard friend; and of a nephew becomes
a ſeruant. No doubt when
Laban heard of his ſiſters ſon, hee
looked for the Camels and attendance
that came to fetch his ſiſter
Rebecca, not thinking that Abrahams
ſeruant could come better
furniſhed, then Iſaacs ſon; but now
when he ſaw nothing but a ſtaffe
he lookes vpon him not as an vncle,

but a maiſter. And while hee
pretends to offer him a wife as
the reward of his ſeruice, he craftily
requires his ſeruice as the
dowry of his wife.
                     After the ſeruice of an hard apprentiſeſhip
hath earned her
whom he loued; his wife is changed,
and hee is, in a ſort, forced to
an vnwilling adultery: His mother
had before in a cunning diſguiſe
ſubſtituted him, who was
the yonger ſon, for the elder; and
now not long after his father in
law, by a like fraud, ſubſtitutes to
him the elder daughter for the
yonger: God comes oftentimes
home to vs in our own kind; and
euen by the ſinne of others paies
vs our owne, when wee looke

not for it. It is doubtfull whether
it were a greater croſſe to marry
whom he would not, or to be diſappointed
of her whom he deſired.
And now hee muſt begin a
new hope, where hee made account
of fruition; To raiſe vp an
expectation once fruſtrate, is
more difficult, then to continue
a long hope drawn on with likelihoods
of performance: yet thus
deere is Iacob content to pay for
Rachel, fourteene yeers ſeruitude:
Commonly Gods children come
not eaſily by their pleaſures: what
miſeries will not loue digeſt and
ouercome? And if Iacob were willingly
conſumed with heat in the
day, with froſt in the night to become
the ſonne in law to Laban:
What ſhould wee refuſe to bee

the ſonnes of God?
                     
                        Rachel whom he loued is barren
Lea which was deſpiſed, is fruitfull;
How wiſely God weighs out
to vs our fauours and croſſes in an
equall ballance; ſo tempering our
ſorrowes that they may not oppreſſe,
and our ioyes that they
may not tranſport vs: each one
hath ſome matter of enuye to others,
and of griefe to himſelfe.
                     
                        Lea enuies Rachels beauty, and
loue; Rachel enuies Leahs fruitfulneſſe:
Yet Lea would not be barren,
nor Rachel bleare eyed. I ſee
in Rachel the image of her grandmother
Sara; both in her beauty
of perſon, in her actions, in her

ſucceſſe: ſhee alſo will needs ſuborne
her handmaid to make her
a mother; and at laſt beyond
hope, her ſelfe conceiueth: It is a
weake greedineſſe in vs to affect
Gods bleſsings by vnlawfull
meanes; what a proofe and praiſe
had it beene of her faith if ſhee
had ſtaied Gods leaſure, &amp; would
rather haue indured her barrenneſſe,
then her husbands Poligamy:
Now ſhe ſhewes herſelfe the
daughter of Laban, the father for
couetouſneſſe, the daughters for
emulation haue drawn ſinne into
Iacobs bedde: Hee offended in
yeelding, but they more in ſolliciting
him, and therefore the fact
is not imputed to Iacob, but to
them. In thoſe ſins which Satan
drawes vs into, the blame is ours,

in thoſe which we moue each other
vnto, the moſt fault and puniſhment
lies vpon the tempter.
None of the Patriarchs diuided
his ſeed into ſo many wombs as
Iacob, none was ſo much croſſed
in his ſeed.
                     Thus rich in nothing but wiues
and children, was hee now returning
to his fathers houſe, accounting
his charge, his wealth.
But God meant him yet more
good. Laban ſees that both his familie,
and his flockes were wel increaſed
by Iacobs ſeruice. Not his
loue therefore but his gain makes
him loath to part. Euen Labans
couetouſneſſe is made by God
the meanes to inrich Iacob.
                     
                     Behold his ſtrait maſter intreats

him to that recompence, which
made his nephew mighty, and
himſelfe enuious: God conſidering
his hard ſeruice paid him his
wages out of Labans folds. Thoſe
flockes and heards had but few
ſpotted ſheep, and goates, vntill
Iacobs couenant, then (as if the faſhion
had beene altered) they all
ran into parted colours, the moſt
and beſt (as if they had bin weary
of their former owner) changed
the colours of their young, that
they might change their maſter.
                     In the very ſhapes and colours
of bruite creatures there is a diuine
hand, which diſpoſeth them
to his owne ends. Small and vnlikely
meanes ſhal preuail where
God intends an effect. Little pilled

ſtickes of haſell or poplar laid
in the troughs ſhall inrich Iacob
with an increaſe of his ſpotted
flockes; Labans ſons might haue
tried the ſame meanes, and failed:
God would haue Laban know
that hee put a difference betwixt
Iacob and him; that as for fourteene
yeeres hee had multiplied
Iacobs charge of cattell to Laban, ſo
now for the laſt ſixe yeeres hee
would multiply Labans flocke to
Iacob? and if Laban had the more,
yet the better were Iacobs: Euen in
theſe outward things, Gods children
haue many times ſenſible
taſtes of his fauours aboue the
wicked.
                     I know not whether Laban were
a worſe vncle, or father, or maſter

he can like well Iacobs ſeruice, not
his wealth. As the wicked haue
no peace with God, ſo the godly
haue no peace with men; for if
they proſper not, they are deſpiſed;
if they proſper, they are
enuyed. This vncle whom his ſeruice
had made his Father, muſt
now vpon his wealth be fled from
as an enemie: and like an enemy
purſues him: If Laban had meant
to haue taken a peaceable leaue,
hee had neuer ſpent ſeuen daies
iourny in following his innocent
ſonne: Iacob knew his churliſhnes
and therefore reſolued rather to
be vnmanerly, then iniuried, well
might hee thinke that hee whoſe
oppreſsion changed his wages ſo
often, in his ſtay would alſo abridge
his wages in the parting;

now therefore hee wiſely prefers
his owne eſtate to Labans loue: It is
not good to regard too much the
vniuſt diſcontentment of wordly
men, and to purchaſe vnprofitable
fauour with too great
loſſe.
                     Behold Laban follows Iacob with
one troup, Eſau meets him with another,
both with hoſtile intentions,
both go on till the vtmoſt
point of their execution: both are
preuented ere the execution. God
makes fools of the enemies of his
Church, hee lets them proceed
that they may bee fruſtrate, and
when they are gone to the vtmoſt
reach of their tether he puls them
backe to their ſtake with ſhame:
Lo now Laban leaues Iacob with a

kiſſe; Eſau meets him with a kiſſe:
Of the one he hath an oath, tears
of the other, peace with both:
Who ſhall need to feare man that
is in league with God?
                     But what a wonder is this: Iacob
receiued not ſo much hurt
from all his enemies, as from his
beſt friend. Not one of his haires
periſhed by Laban, or Eſau; yet he
loſt a ioynt by the Angell, and
was ſent halting to his graue: He
that knows our ſtrength, yet will
wreſtle with vs for our exerciſe;
and loues our violence and importunity.
                     Oh happy loſſe of Iacob, hee
loſt a ioynt and won a bleſsing: It
is a fauour to halt from God, yet

this fauour is ſeconded with a
greater. He is bleſſed becauſe hee
would rather halt then leaue ere
hee was bleſſed. If hee had left
ſooner, hee had not halted,
but he had not proſpered. That
man ſhall goe away ſound, but
miſerable, that loues a limme
more then a bleſsing. Surely if
Iacob had not wreſtled with God,
he had beene foyled with euills:
How many are the troubles of
the righteous.
                     Not long after, Rachel; the comfort
of his life, dyeth. And when
but in her trauell, and in his trauell
to his Father? when hee had
now before digeſted in his
thoughts the ioy and gratulation
of his aged father, for ſo welcome

a burden. His children, (the ſtaffe
of his age) wound his ſoule to the
death. Reuben proues inceſtuous,
Iuda adulterous, Dinah rauiſhed;
Simeon and Leui murderous, Er,
and Onan ſtriken dead, Ioſeph loſt;
Simeon impriſoned; Beniamin, the
death of his mother, the Fathers
right hand, indangered; himſelfe
driuen by famin, in his old age, to
dye amongſt the Aegyptians, a
people that held it abhomination
to eat with him. If that Angel with
whom he ſtroue, and who therefore
ſtroue for him, had not deliuered
his ſoule out of all aduerſitie
he had beene ſupplanted with
euils, and had bene ſo farre from
gaining the name of Iſrael, that
he had loſt the name of Iacob, now
what ſon of Iſraell can hope for

good daies, when hee heares his
Fathers were ſo euill? It is enough
for vs if when we are dead we can
reſt with him in the land of promiſe.
If the Angell of the couenant
once bleſſe vs, no payne, no
ſorrowes can make vs miſerable.
                  
                  
                     Dinah.
                     I Find but one only daughter of
Iacob, who muſt needs therfore
be a great dearling to her father;
and ſhee ſo miſcarries, that ſhee
cauſes her fathers griefe to bee
more then his loue. As her mother
Leah; ſo ſhee hath a fault in
her eyes, which was, Curioſity:

Shee will needs ſee, and be ſeene;
and whiles ſhee doth vainely ſee,
ſhee is ſeene luſtfully. It is not enough
for vs to looke to our own
thoughts, except wee beware of
the prouocations of others: If we
once wander out of the liſts that
God hath ſet vs in our callings,
there is nothing but danger: Her
virginity had bene ſafe if ſhe had
kept home; or if Sechem had forced
her in her mothers tent; this loſſe
of her virginity had bene without
her ſinne; now ſhee is not innocent
that gaue the occaſion.
                     Her eies were guilty of this
temptation: Only to ſee, is an inſufficient
warrant to draw vs into
places of ſpirituall hazard: If
Sechem had ſeene her buſie at

home his loue had bene free from
outrage; now the lightnes of her
preſence gaue incouragement to
his inordinate deſires. Immodeſty
of behauiour makes way to
luſt; and giues life vnto wicked
hopes: yet Sechem bewraies a good
nature euen in filthineſſe; Hee
loues Dinah after his ſinne, and
will needs marry her whom hee
hath defiled. Commonly luſt
ends in loathing: Ammon abhors
Thamar as much, after his act, as
before, hee loued her; and beats
her out of doores, whom he was
ſicke to bring in. But Sechem wold
not let Dinah fare the worſe for
his ſin. And now he goes about
to intertain her with honeſt loue,
whom the rage of his luſt had diſhoneſtly
abuſed. Her deflowring

ſhall be no preiudice to her,
ſince her ſhame ſhall redound to
none but him, and hee will hide
her diſhonour with the name of
an husband. What could he now
doe, but ſue to his Father, to hers,
to her ſelfe; to her brethren, intreating
that, with humble ſubmiſsion
which he might haue obtained
by violence. Thoſe actions
which are ill begun, can hardly be
ſalued vp with late ſatisfactions;
whereas good entrances giue
ſtrength vnto the proceedings,
and ſucceſſe to the end.
                     The young mans father, doth
not onely conſent but ſolicit; and
is ready to purchaſe a daughter
either with ſubſtance, or paine:
The two olde men would haue

ended the matter peaceably; but
youth commonly vndertakes
raſhly, and performes with paſsion,
The ſonnes of Iacob thinke of
nothing but reuenge, and (which
is worſt of all) begin their cruelty
with craft, and hide their craft
with religion: A ſmiling malice is
moſt deadly; and hatred doth
moſt ranckle the heart when it is
kept in and diſſembled. We cannot
giue our ſiſter to an vncircumciſed
man; heere was God in
the mouth, and Satan in the hart:
The bloodieſt of al proiects haue
euer wont to bee coloured with
religion: becauſe the woorſe any
thing is, the better ſhew it deſires
to make; and contrarily, the better
colour is put vpon any vice,
the more odious it is; for as euery

ſimulation ads to an euill, ſo the
beſt ads moſt euil: themſelues had
taken the daughters and ſiſters of
vncircumciſed men; Yea Iacob
himſelfe did ſo; why might not
an vncircumciſed man obtaine
their ſiſter? Or if there be a difference
of giuing and taking, it had
bin wel if it had not bin only pretended.
It had bene an happy rauiſhment
of Dinah that ſhould
haue drawn a whole country into
the boſom of the church: but here
was a ſacrament intended, not to
the good of the ſoul, but to murder
of the body: It was an hard
task for Hamor and Sechem not only
to put the knife to their owne
foreskins, but to perſwade a multitude
to ſo painful a condition.
                     The Sonnes of Iacob diſſemble

with them, they with the people.
(Shall not their flockes and ſubſtance
be ours?) Common profit is pretended;
whereas onely Sechems
pleaſure is meant. No motiue is
ſo powerfull to the vulgar ſort, as
the name of commodity; The
hope of this makes them prodigall
of their skin and blood; Not
the loue to the Sacrament, not
the loue to Sechem: ſiniſter reſpects
draw more to the profeſsion
of religion, then conſcience:
if it were not for the loaues and
fiſhes, the traine of Chriſt would
bee leſſe. But the Sacraments of
God miſ-receiued, neuer proſper
in the end, Theſe men are content
to ſmart, ſo they may gaine.
                     And now that euery man lies

ſore of his owne wound, Simeon
and Leui ruſh in armed, &amp; wound
all the males to death: Curſed be
their wrath for it was fierce, and
their rage for it was cruell: indeed,
filthineſſe ſhould not haue
beene wrought in Iſrael; but murder
ſhould not haue bin wrought
by Iſraell; if they had beene fit
iudges (which were but bloodie
executioners) how farre doth the
puniſhment exceed the fault? To
puniſh aboue the offence is no
leſſe vniuſtice, then to offend one
offendeth, and all feele the reuenge:
yea all, (though innocent)
ſuffer that reuenge, which he that
offended, deſerued not. Sechem
ſinned, but Dinah tempted him:
Shee that was ſo light, as to wander
abroad alone, onely to gaze,

I feare was not ouer difficult to
yeeld: And if hauing wrought
her ſhame, heee had driuen her
home with diſgrace to her fathers
tent, ſuch tyrannous luſt had iuſtly
called for blood, but now hee
craues, and offers, and would pay
deere for but leaue to giue ſatiſfaction.
                     To execute rigour vpon a ſubmiſſe
offender is more mercileſſe
then iuſt: Or if the puniſhment
had beene both iuſt and proportionable
from another, yet from
them which had vowed peace
and affinity, it was ſhamefully
vniuſt. To diſappoint the truſt of
another, and to neglect our own
promiſe and fidelity for priuate
purpoſes, addes faithleſneſſe vnto

our cruelty. That they were
impotent it was through their
circumciſion: what impiety was
this inſteed of honouring an holy
ſigne, to take an aduantage by
it? what ſhrieking was there now
in the ſtreets of the citie of the
Hiuites? And how did the beguiled
Sichemites when they ſaw
the ſwords of the two brethren,
die curſing that Sacrament in
their hearts which had betraied
them? Euen their curſes were the
ſinnes of Simeon and Leui; whoſe
fact, though it were abhorred by
their father, yet it was ſeconded
by their brethren. Their ſpoile
makes good the others ſlaughter.
Who would haue looked to
haue found this outrage in the
familie of Iacob? How did that

good Patriarke when he ſaw Dinah
come home blubbered and
wringing her hands, Simeon and
Leui ſprinkled with blood, wiſh
that Leah had bene barren as long
as Rachel: Good parents haue
greefe enough (though they ſuſtaine
no blame) for their childrens
ſins: What great euils ariſe
from ſmall beginnings. The idle
Curioſity of Dinah hath bred all
this miſchiefe, Rauiſhment ſollowes
vpon her wandring, vpon
her rauiſhment murder, vpon the
murder ſpoyle: It is holy and ſafe
to be iealous of the firſt occaſions
of euill either done, or ſuffered
                  
                  
                     
                     Judah and Thamar.
                     I Find not many of Iacobs ſonnes
more faulty then Iudah; who yet
is ſingled out from all the reſt, to
be the royal progenitor of Chriſt;
and to be honoured with the dignity
of the birthright; that Gods
election might not bee of merit,
but of grace: Elſe howſoeuer hee
might haue ſped alone, Thamar
had neuer bene ioyned with him
in this line: Euen Iudah marries a
Canaanite, it is no maruel though
his ſeed proſper not: And yet that
good children may not bee too
much diſcouraged with their vnlawfull
propagation, the fathers
of the promiſed ſeede are raiſed

from an ineeſtuous bed: Iudah was
very yong, ſcarce from vnder the
rod of his Father, yet he takes no
other counſell for his marriage,
but from his owne eyes, which
were like his ſiſter Dinahs, rouing
and wanton, what better iſſue
could be expected from ſuch beginnings.
Thoſe proud Iews that
glory ſo much of their pedigree
and name from this Patriarch,
may now chooſe whether they
will haue their mother a Canaanite,
or an harlot: Euen in theſe
things oft-times the birth follows
the belly. His eldeſt ſon Er, is too
wicked to liue; God ſtrikes him
dead ere hee can leaue any iſſue,
not abiding any ſience to grow
out of ſo bad a ſtocke: Notorious
ſinners God reſerues to his owne

vengeance, Hee doth not inflict
ſenſible iudgements vpon all his
enemies, leaſt the wicked ſhould
thinke there were no puniſhment
abiding for them elſwhere. Hee
doth inflict ſuch iudgements vpon,
ſome, leaſt hee ſhould ſeeme
careleſſe of euill. It were as eaſie
for him to ſtrike all dead, as one:
but he had rather all ſhould bee
warned by one, and would haue
his enemies find him mercifull, as
his children iuſt: His brother Onan
ſees the iudgement, and yet
follows his ſins. Euery little thing
diſcourages vs from good. Nothing
can alter the heart that is
ſet vpon euill: Er was not worthy
of any loue; but though hee were
a miſcreant, yet he was a brother
Seed ſhould haue beene raiſed to

him; Onan iuſtly leeſes his life with
his ſeed; which hee would rather
ſpill, then lend to a wicked brother.
Some duties wee owe to humanity,
more to neernes of bloud
Ill deſeruings of others can be no
excuſe for our iniuſtice, for our
vncharitableneſſe. That which
Thamar required, Moſes afterward,
as from God, commaunded; the
ſucceſsion of brothers into the
barren bedde: Some lawes God
ſpake to his Church long ere hee
wrote them: while the author is
certainly knowne, the voice and
the finger of God are worthie of
equall reſpect. Iudah hath loſt two
ſonnes, and now doth but promiſe
the third, whom he ſinnes in
not giuing. It is the weakeneſſe of
nature, rather to hazard a ſinne,

then a daunger. And to neglect
our owne duety, for wrongfull
ſuſpicion of others: though hee
had loſt his ſonne in giuing him:
yet hee ſhould haue giuen him:
A faithfull mans promiſe is his
debt, which no feare of damage
can diſpeuſe with.
                     But whereupon was this ſlackneſſe?
Iudah feared that ſome vnhappineſſe
in the bed of Thamar
was the cauſe of his ſons miſcarriage;
whereas it was their fault
that Thamar was both a widow
and childleſſe. Thoſe that are but
the patients of euill, are many
times burdened with ſuſpitions;
and therefore are ill thought of,
becauſe they fare ill: Afflictions
would not be ſo heauy if they did

not lay vs open vnto vncharitable
conceipts.
                     What difference God puts betwixt
ſinnes of wilfulneſſe, and infirmity?
The ſonnes pollution is
puniſhed with preſent death, the
fathers inceſt is pardoned, and in
a ſort proſpereth.
                     Now Thamar ſeeks by ſubtlety,
that which ſhe could not haue by
award of iuſtice; the neglect of due
retributions driues men to indirect
courſes; neither know I whether
they ſinne more in righting
themſelues wrongfully, or the other
in not righting them: Shee
therefore takes vpon her the habit
of an harlot, that ſhee might
performe the act; If ſhee had not
wiſhed to ſeeme an whoore, ſhe

had not worn that attire, nor choſen
that place, immodeſty of outward
faſhion or geſture bewraies
euill deſires, the heart that means
well, will neuer wiſh to ſeeme ill;
for commonly we affect to ſhew
better then we are. Many harlots
wil put on the ſemblances of chaſtity,
of modeſty, neuer the contrary.
It is no truſting thoſe which
do not wiſh to appeare good. Iudah
eſteems her by her habit, and
now the ſight of an harlot hath
ſtird vp in him a thought of luſt;
Satan finds well that a fit obiect is
halfe a victory.
                     Who would not bee aſhamed
to ſee a ſon of Iacob thus tranſported
with filthy affections? At the
firſt ſight is hee inflamed; neither

yet did hee ſee the face of her,
whom hee luſted after, it was enough
motiue to him that ſhee
was a woman; neither could the
preſence of his neighbour the Adullamite
compoſe thoſe wicked
thoughts, or hinder his vnchaſte
acts.
                     That ſinne muſt needs bee
impudent, which can abide a witneſſe:
yea ſo hath his luſt beſotted
him, that he cannot diſcerne
the voice of Thamar, that he cannot
foreſee the danger of his
ſhame in parting with ſuch pledges.
There is no paſsion which
doth not for the time bereaue a
man of himſelfe: Thamar had learned
not to truſt him without a
pawne; He had promiſed his ſon
to her as a daughter, and failed;

now hee promiſed a kid to her as
an harlot, &amp; performeth it, whether
his pledge conſtrained him,
or the power of his word, I inquire
not: Many men are faithfull
in all things, ſaue thoſe which are
the greateſt, and deareſt; If his
credit had beene as much indangered
in the former promiſe, hee
had kept it: Now hath Thamar requited
him. Shee expected long
the inioying of his promiſed ſon,
and he performed not: but heere
he performes the promiſe of the
kid, and ſhe ſtaies not to expect it;
Iudah is ſory that hee cannot pay
the hire of his luſt, and now feareth
leſt he ſhall be beaten with
his owne ſtaffe, leaſt his ſignet
ſhall be vſed to confirme, and ſeal
his reproch; reſoluing not to

know them; and wiſhing they
were vnknowne of others. Shame
is the eaſieſt wages of ſin, and the
ſureſt, which euer begins firſt in
our ſelues. Nature is not more
forward to commit ſinne, then
willing to hide it.
                     I heare as yet of no remorſe in
Iudah, but feare of ſhame. Three
moneths hath his ſinne ſlept, and
now when hee is ſecureſt, it awakes
and baites him. Newes is
brought him that Thamar begins
to ſwell with her conception, and
now he ſwels with rage, and cals
her foorth to the flame like a rigorous
iudge, without ſo much as
ſtaying for the time of her deliuerance;
that his cruelty in this iuſtice,
ſhould bee no leſſe ill, then

the vniuſtice of occaſioning it. If
Iuda had not forgotten his ſinne,
his pitty had beene more then
his hatred to this of his daughters:
How eaſie is it to deteſt thoſe
ſinnes in others which we flatter
in our ſelues: Thamar doth not deny
the ſinne, nor refuſe puniſhment;
but cals for that partner in
her puniſhment, which was her
partner in the ſinne: the ſtaffe, the
ſignet, the handkerchiefe accuſe
and conuince Iuda, and now hee
bluſhes at his owne ſentence,
much more at his act, and cryes
out (ſhe is more righteous then I)
God will find a time to bring his
children vpon their knees, and to
wring from them penitent confeſſions:
And rather then hee will
not haue them ſoundly aſhamed,

hee will make them the trumpets
of their owne reproch.
                     Yet doth hee not offer himſelfe
to the flame with her, but rather
excuſes her by himſelfe.
This relenting in his owne caſe
ſhamed his former zeale: Euen in
the beſt men nature is partial to
it ſelfe: It is good ſo to ſentence
others frailties, that yet wee remember
our owne, whether thoſe
that haue beene, or may bee,
with what ſhame, yea with what
horror muſt Iudah needs look vp-vpon
the great belly of Thamar,
and on her two ſons, the monuments
of his filthineſſe?
                     How muſt it needs wound his
ſoule to hear them call him both

Father, and Grandfather, to call
her mother, and ſiſter: If this had
not coſt him many a ſigh, he had
no more eſcaped his Fathers curſe
then Reuben did: I ſee the difference
not of ſins, but of men: Remiſſion
goes not by the meaſure
of the ſinne, but the quality of the
ſinner; yea rather, the mercy of
the forgiuer: Bleſſed is the man
(not that ſins not, but) to whom
the Lord imputes not his ſinne.
                  
                  
                     
                     Joſeph.
                     I Maruell not that Ioſeph had the
double portion of Iacobs land,
who had more then two parts of
his ſorrowes: None of his ſons did
ſo truely inherit his afflictions;
none of them was either ſo miſerable,
or ſo great: ſuffering is the
way to glory: I ſee in him not a
cleerer type of Chriſt, then of euery
Chriſtian, becauſe wee are
deere to our Father, and complain
of ſins, therefore are we hated of
our carnall brethren: If Ioſeph had
not medled with his brothers
faults, yet hee had beene enuied
for his Fathers affection; but
now malice is met with enuie:

There is nothing more thankeleſſe
or dangerous then to ſtand
in the way of a reſolute ſinner:
That which doth correct and oblige
the penitent, makes the wilfull
minde furious and reuengefull.
                     All the ſpight of his brethren
cannot make Ioſeph caſt off the liuery
of his fathers loue: what
neede we care for the cenſures of
men 
                           〈◊〉
                         if our hearts can tell vs
that we are in fauour with God.
                     But what ment yoong Ioſeph to
adde vnto his owne enuie▪ by reporting
his dreames? The concealement
of our hopes or abilities
hath not more modeſty, then
ſafety: Hee that was enuied for

his deereneſſe, and hated for his
intelligence, was both enuied and
hated for his dreams. Surely God
meant to make the relation of
theſe dreames, a meanes to effect
that which theſe dreames imported.
Wee men worke by likely
meanes; God by contraries. The
main quarrel was, (Behold this dreamer
commeth.) Had it not bene for
his dreams; he had not bin ſolde,
if he had not bene ſold, hee had
not bin exalted. So Ioſephs ſtate had
not deſerued enuie, if his dreams
had not cauſed him to be enuied.
Full little did Ioſeph thinke when
he went to ſeek his brethren that
this was the laſt time hee ſhould
ſee his Fathers houſe: Full little
did his brethren think when they
ſolde him naked to the Iſmaelites

to haue once ſeene him in the
throne of Aegypt. Gods decree
runnes on; and while wee, either
think not of it, or oppoſe it, is performed.
                     In an honeſt and obedient ſimplicity
Ioſeph comes to inquire of
his brethrens health, and now
may not returne to carry newes
of his owne miſery: whiles hee
thinks of their welfare they are
plotting his deſtruction. (Come let
vs ſlay him,) Who would haue
expected this cruelty in them
which ſhould bee the Fathers of
Gods Church: It was thought a
fauour that Reubens intreaty obtained
for him that hee might be
caſt into the pit aliue; to die there.
He lookt for brethren, and behold

murtherers; Euery mans tongue,
euery mans fiſt was bent againſt
him: Each one ſtriues who ſhall
lay the firſt hand vppon that
changeable cote, which was died
with their Fathers loue, and their
enuie: And now they haue ſtript
him naked, and haling him by
both armes, as it were: caſt him aliue
into his graue. So in pretence
of forbearance, they reſolue to
torment him with a lingring
death: the ſauageſt robbers could
not haue beene more mercileſſe:
for now beſides (what in them
lyes) they kill their Father in their
brother. Nature if it once degenerate,
grows more monſtrous and
extreme then a diſpoſition borne
to cruelty.
                     All this while Ioſeph wanted neither

words nor teares, but like a
paſsionate ſuppliant (bowing his
bare knees to them whom hee
dreamed ſhould bow to him) intreates
and perſwades by the deer
name of their brotherhood, by
their profeſsion of one common
God, for their fathers ſake; for their
owne ſouls ſake not to ſin againſt
his bloud: But enuy hath ſhut out
mercy; and makes them not only
forget themſelues to be brethren,
but men: What ſtranger
can thinke of poore innocent Ioſeph,
crying naked in that deſolate
and drye pit (only ſauing that
he moyſtened it with teares) and
not be moued? Yet his hard-harted
brethren ſit them down careleſly,
with the noyſe of his lamentation
in their eares, to eat bread;

not once thinking by their owne
hunger, what it was for Ioſeph to
be affamiſht to death.
                     Whatſoeuer they thought, God
neuer meant that Ioſeph ſhould
periſh in that pit; and therfore he
ſends very Iſmaelites to raunſome
him from his brethren; the ſeed of
him that perſecuted his brother
Iſaac, ſhal now redeem Ioſeph from
his brethrens perſecution: When
they came to fetch him out of the
pit, hee now hoped for a ſpeedy
diſpatch; That ſince they ſeemed
not to haue ſo much mercy as to
prolong his life, they would not
continue ſo much cruelty as to
prolong his death.
                     And now when he hath comforted

himſelfe with hope of the
fauour of dying, behold death exchanged
for bondage: how much
is ſeruitude to an ingenuous nature
worſe then death? For this is
common to all; that, to none but
the miſerable: Iudah meant this
well, but God better: Reuben ſaued
him from the ſword; Iudah from
affamiſhing: God will euer raiſe
vp ſome ſecret fauourers to his
own amongſt thoſe that are moſt
malicious: How well was this fauor
beſtowed? If Ioſeph had died
for hunger in the pit, both Iacob
and Iudah, and al his brethren had
died for hunger in Canaan. Little
did the Iſmaelitiſh merchants
know what a treſure they bought
carryed and ſold; more pretious
then al their balmes and mirrhes.

Little did they thinke that they
had in their hands the Lord of Egypt,
the Iewell of the worlde:
Why ſhould wee contemne any
mans meanneſſe, when we know
not his deſtiny?
                     One ſinne is commonly vſed
for the vail of another: Ioſephs coat
is ſent home dipped in blood, that
whiles they ſhould hide their
owne cruelty, they might afflict
their Father, no leſſe then their
brother. They haue deuiſed this
really to puniſh their olde father
for his loue, with ſo grieuous a
monument of his ſorrow.
                     Hee that is mourned for in Canaan
as dead, proſpers in Egypt
vnder Potiphar; and of a ſlaue is

made a ruler: Thus God meant
to prepare him for a greater
charge; he muſt firſt rule Potiphars
houſe, then Pharaohs kingdome:
his owne ſeruice is his leaſt good;
for his very preſence procures a
common bleſsing: A whole family
ſhall fare the better for one
Ioſeph: Vertue is not lookt vpon alike
with al eyes: his fellows praiſe
him, his maiſter truſts him, his
miſtreſſe affects him too much.
All the ſpight of his brethren was
not ſo great a croſſe to him, as the
inordinate affection of his miſtreſſe.
Temptations on the right
hand are now more perilous, and
hard to reſiſt, by how much they
are more plauſible and glorious;
But the heart that is bent vppon
God, knows how to walke ſteddily

and indifferently betwixt the
pleaſures of ſinne; and feares of
euill: He ſaw, this pleaſure would
aduance him: Hee knew what it
was to be a minion of one of the
greateſt Ladies in Egypt: yet reſolues
to contemne it: A good
heart will rather lye in the duſt,
then riſe by wickedneſſe. (How
ſhall I doe this, and ſinne againſt
God.
                     
                     He knew that all the honours
of Egypt could not buy off the
guilt of one ſinne, and therefore
abhors not onely her bed, but her
company: Hee that will bee ſafe
from the acts of euill, muſt wiſely
auoide the occaſions, as ſin ends
euer in ſhame when it is committed,
ſo it makes vs paſt ſhame that

wee may commit it; The impudent
ſtrumpet dare not onely ſolicit,
but importune, but in a ſort
force the modeſty of her good
ſeruant; She laies hold on his garment;
her hand ſeconds her
tongue.
                     Good Ioſeph found it now time
to flee; when ſuch an enemy purſued
him; how much had hee rather
leaue his cloke, then his vertue.
And to ſuffer his miſtreſſe to
ſpoile him of his liuery, rather
then hee ſhould blemiſh her honor,
or his maiſters in her, or God
in either of them.
                     This ſecond time is Ioſeph ſtript
of his garment; before, in the violence
of enuie, now of luſt; before

of neceſsity, now of choice: Before,
to deceiue his father, now
his maiſter: for behold, the pledge
of his fidelity which hee left in
thoſe wicked hands, is made an
euidence againſt him of that
which he refuſed to doe: therfore
did hee leaue his cloake becauſe
he would not doe that; of which
he is accuſed and condemned becauſe
he left it: what ſafety is there
againſt great aduerſaries, when euen
arguments of innocence are
vſed to conuince of euill? Luſt
yeelded vnto is a pleaſant madneſſe,
but is a deſperate madneſſe
when it is oppoſed: No hatred
burnes ſo furiouſly as that which
ariſes from the quenched coles
of loue.
                     Malice is witty to deuiſe accuſations

of others out of their vertue,
and our owne guiltineſſe: Ioſeph
either pleades not, or is not
heard.
                     Doubtleſſe he denied the fact,
but he dare not accuſe the offender:
There is not only the praiſe
of patience but oft-times of wiſedome,
euen in vniuſt ſufferings:
Hee knew that God would finde
a time to cleere his innocence,
and to reward his chaſte faithfulneſſe.
                     No priſon would ſerue him,
but Paraohs. Ioſeph had lyen obſcure,
and not beene knowne to
Pharaoh, if he had not beene caſt
into Paraohs dungeon: the afflictions
of Gods chidren turne euer

to their aduantages. No ſooner is
Ioſeph a priſoner, then a gardian
of the priſoners. Truſt and honor
accompany him whereſoeuer he
is: In his Fathers houſe, In Potiphars,
in the Iayle, in the Court;
ſtill hee hath both fauour and
rule.
                     So long as God is with him, he
cannot but ſhine in ſpight of men
The walls of that dungeon cannot
hide his vertues, the yrons
cannot holde them. Paraohs officers
are ſent to witneſſe his graces,
which hee may not come
forth to ſhew, the cup-bearer admires
him in the iayle, but forgets
him in the Court. How eaſily
doth our owne proſperity make
vs forget either the deſeruings, or

miſeries of others. But as God
cannot neglect his owne, ſo leaſt
of all in their ſorrowes. After
two yeares more of Ioſephs patience;
that God which cauſed him
to be lift out of the former pit to
be ſold; now cals him out of the
dungeon to honour. Hee now
puts a dreame into the head of
Pharaoh. Hee puts the remembrance
of Ioſephs skil into the head
of the cup-bearer, who to pleaſure
Pharaoh, not to requite Ioſeph;
commends the priſoner, for an
interpreter: He puts an interpretation
in the mouth of Ioſeph▪
                         hee
puts this choice into the heart of
Pharaoh of a miſerable priſoner to
make the ruler of Egypt. Beholde
one houre hath changed his fetters
into a chaine of gold, his rags

into fine linnen, his ſtockes into a
chariot, his iayle into a pallace,
Potiphars captiue into his Maiſters
Lord; the noyſe of his chains into
Abrech. He whoſe chaſtity refuſed
the wanton allurements of
the wife of Potiphar, hath now
giuen him to his wife the daughter
of Potipherah. Humility goes
before honour; ſeruing and ſuffering
are the beſt tutors to gouernement.
How well are Gods
children paide for their patience?
How happy are the iſſues of the
faithfull? Neuer any man repented
him of the aduancement of a
good man.
                     
                        Pharaoh hath not more preferd
Ioſeph then Ioſeph hath enriched
Pharaoh; If Ioſeph had not ruled Egypt

and all bordering nations
had periſhed▪ The prouidence
of ſo faithfull an officer hath both
giuen the Egyptians their liues,
and the money, cattle, lands, bodies
of the Egyptians to Pharaoh.
Both haue reaſon to be well pleaſed.
The ſubiects owe to him
their liues, the King his ſubiects,
and his dominions, The bountie
of God made Ioſeph able to
giue more than he receiued. It is
like, the ſeuen yeeres of plentie
were not confined to Egypt; other
countries adioining were no
leſſe fruitfull: yet in the ſeuen
yeeres of famine Egypt had corn
when they wanted.
                     See the difference betwixt a
wiſe prouident frugalitie, and a

vaine ignorant expence of the benefits
of God: The ſparing hand
is both full and beneficiall, wheras
the lauiſhment is not only empty,
but iniurious.
                     Good Iacob is pinched with the
common famine. No piety can
exempt vs from the euils of
neighbourhood. No man can tell
by outward euents, which is the
Patriarke, and which the Canaanite.
                     Neither doth his profeſsion
lead him to the hope of a miraculous
preſeruation. It is a vaine
tempting of God to caſt our ſelues
vppon an immediate prouiſion,
with neglect of common means:
His tenne ſonnes muſt now leaue

their flockes, and goe down into
Egypt, to be their fathers purueyours.
And now they go to buy of
him whom they had folde; and
bow the knees to him for his life,
which had bowed to them before
for his owne life. His age, his
habit; the place, the language
kept Ioſeph from their knowledge;
neither had they called off their
minds from their folds, to inquire
of matters of forren ſtate, or to
heare that an Ebrew was aduanced
to the higheſt honour of Egypt▪
But hee can not but know
them, whom hee left at their full
growth, whoſe tongue and habit,
and number were ſtill one: whoſe
faces had left ſo deep an impreſſion
in his minde, 
                           •
                        t their vnkind
parting: It is wiſedome ſomtimes

ſo to conceale our knowledge,
that we may not preiudice truth.
                     Hee that was hated of his brethren
for beeing his fathers ſpye;
now accuſes his brethren for
common ſpyes of the weakneſſes
of Egypt; hee could not without
their ſuſpicion haue come to a
perfect intelligence of his fathers
eſtate, and theirs, if he had not obiected
to them that which was
not. We are not alwaies bound to
go the neereſt way to trueth. It is
more ſafe in caſes of inquiſition
to fetch far about, that he might
ſeeme enough an Egyptian, hee
ſweares heatheniſhly. How little
could they ſuſpect, this oath could
proceed from the ſonne of him,
which ſwore by the feare of his

father Iſaac? How oft haue ſiniſter
reſpects drawne weake goodnes
to diſguiſe it ſelfe, euen with ſins?
                     It was no ſmall ioy to Ioſeph, to
ſee this late accompliſhment of
his ancient dreame; to ſee theſe
ſuppliants (I know not whether
more brethren, or enemies)
groueling before him in an vnknowing
ſubmiſsion: And now it
doth him good to ſeeme merciles
to them, whom he had found
wilfully cruell; to hide his loue
from them which had ſhewed
their hate to him, and to thinke
how much he fauourd them, and
how little they knew it: And as
ſporting himſelfe in their ſeeming
miſery, he pleaſantly imitates all
thoſe actions reciprocally vnto

them, which they in deſpight and
earneſt, had done formerly to
him; hee ſpeakes roughly, reiects
their perſwaſions, puts them in
hold, and one of them in bonds.
The minde muſt not alwaies bee
iudged by the outward face of
the actions. Gods countenance is
oft-times as ſeuere, and his hand
as heauy to them whom hee beſt
loueth. Many a one vnder the
habit of an Egyptian hath the
hart of an Iſraelite. No ſong could
be ſo delightful to him, as to hear
them in a late remorſe condemn
themſelues before him, of their
old cruelty towards him, who
was now their vnknown witneſſe
and Iudge.
                     Nothing doth ſo powerfully

call home the conſcience, as affliction;
neither need there any other
art of memory for ſinne, beſides
miſery. They had heard Ioſephs
deprecation of their euil with
teares, and had not pityed him;
yet Ioſeph doth but heare their
mention of this euill which they
had done againſt him, and pities
them with teares, hee weeps for
ioy to ſee their repentance, and to
compare his ſafety and happines
with the cruelty which they intended,
and did, and thought
they had done.
                     Yet he can abide to ſee his brother
his priſoner; whom no bonds
could bind ſo ſtrong, as his affection
bound him to his captiue:
Simeon is left in pawne, infetters;

the reſt returne, with their corne,
with their mony, paying nothing
for their prouiſion; but their labour;
that they might be as much
troubled with the benificence of
that ſtrange Egyptian Lord, as
before with his imperious ſuſpition.
Their wealth was now more
irkeſom to them, then their need,
and they feare God means to puniſh
them more in this ſuperfluitie
of money, then in the want of
victuals. (What is this that God hath
done to vs?) It is a wiſe courſe to
be iealous of our gaine; and more
to feare, then deſire abundance.
                     Old Iacob that was not vſed to
ſimple and abſolut contentments
receiues the bleſsing of ſeaſonable
prouiſion, together with the

affliction of that heauy meſſage;
the loſſe of one ſonne, and the
danger of another. And knowes
not whether it be better for him
to die with hunger, or with griefe
for the departure of that ſonne of
his right hand: Hee driues off till
the laſt; Protraction is a kinde of
eaſe in euils that muſt come.
                     At length (as no plea is importunate
as that of famine) Beniamin
muſt goe; one euill muſt bee hazarded
for the redreſſe of another
what would it auaile him to ſee
whom he loued, miſerable? how
iniurious were that affliction to
keepe his ſonne ſo long in his eye
till they ſhould ſee each other die
for hunger.
                     The ten brothers returne into

Egypt loaded with double mony
in their ſackes, and a preſent in
their hands; the danger of miſtaking
is requited, by honeſt minds
with more then reſtitution. It is
not enough to find our own harts
clear in ſuſpicious actions, except
we ſatisfie others: Now hath Ioſeph
what he would, the ſight and
preſence of his Beniamin, whom
he therefore borrowes of his Father
for a time, that he might returne
him with a greater intereſt
of ioy: And now hee feaſts them
whom hee formerly threatned,
and turnes their feare into wonder;
all vnequall loue is not partiall;
all the brethren are intertained
bountifully, but Beniamin
hath a fiue-fold portion: By how
much his welcome was greater,

by ſo much his pretended theft
ſeemed more hainous, for good
turnes aggrauate vnkindneſſes,
and our offences are increaſed
with our obligations: How eaſie
is it to finde aduantages, where
there is a purpoſe to accuſe: Beniamins
ſacke makes him guilty of
that whereof his heart was free:
Crimes ſeeme ſtrange to the innocent;
well might they abiure
this fact with the offer of bondage
and death: For they which
carefully brought againe that
which they might haue taken,
would neuer take that which was
not giuen them. But thus Ioſeph
would yet dally with his brethren,
and make Beniamin a theefe
that he might make him a ſeruant
and fright his brethren with the

perill of that their charge, that he
might double their ioy, and amazedneſſe
in giuing them two brothers
at once: our happineſſe is
greater, and ſweeter when wee
haue well feared, and ſmarted
with euills.
                     But now when Iudah ſeriouſly
reported the danger of his old father,
and the ſadneſſe of his laſt
complaint, compaſsion and ioy
will be concealed no longer; but
breake forth violently at his voice
and eies. Many paſſions doe not
well abide witneſſes, becauſe they
are guilty to their owne weakeneſſe:
Ioſeph ſends foorth his ſeruants
that he might freely weep.
He knew he could not ſay, I am
Ioſeph, without an vnbeleeuing

vehemence.
                     Neuer any worde ſounded ſo
ſtrangely as this, in the eares of
the Patriarkes. Wonder, doubt,
reuerence, ioy, feare, hope, guiltineſſe
ſtroke them at once. It was
time for Ioſeph to ſay Feare not;
No maruell if they ſtood with
paleneſſe and ſilence before him;
looking on him, and on each other:
the more they conſidered,
they wondred, and the more they
beleeued, the more they feared:
For thoſe words (I am Ioſeph,) ſeemed
to ſound thus much to their
guilty thoughts: You are murtherers,
and I am a Prince in ſpight of
you; My power and this place,
giue me all opportunities of reuenge;
My glory is your ſhame,

my life your danger, your ſinne
liues together with mee. But now
the teares and gratious words of
Ioſeph haue ſoone aſſured them of
pardon and loue, and haue bidden
them turne their eies from
their ſinne againſt their brother,
to their happineſſe in him, and
haue changed their doubts into
hopes and ioyes; cauſing them
to looke vppon him without
feare, though not without ſhame.
His louing imbracements cleare
their hearts of all iealouſies; and
haſten to put new thoughts into
them; of fauour, and of greatnes:
So that now forgetting what euill
they did to their brother, they
are thinking of what good their
brother may doe to them: Actions
ſalued vp with a free forgiueneſſe,

are as not done; and as a
bone once broken is ſtronger after
well ſetting, ſo is loue after
reconcilement.
                     But as wounds once healed
leaue a ſcarre behind them; ſo remitted
iniuries leaue commonly
in the actors a guilty remembrance;
which hindred theſe brethren
from that freedom of ioy
which elſe they had conceiued:
This was their fault, not Ioſephs;
who ſtriues to giue them all ſecurity
of his loue, and will bee as
bountifull, as they were cruell.
They ſent him naked to ſtrangers,
he ſends them in new and
rich liueryes to their Father; they
tooke a ſmall ſumme of money
for him, he giues them great treaſures;

They ſent his torne cote to
his Father; Hee ſends variety of
coſtly raiments to his Father by
them: They ſold him to bee the
load of camels; Hee ſends them
home with chariots. It muſt be a
great fauor that can appeaſe the
conſcience of a great iniury. Now
they returne home rich and ioyfull,
making themſelues happy to
thinke, how glad they ſhould
make their father with this news.
                     That good old man would
neuer haue hoped that Egypt
could haue affoorded ſuch prouiſion
as this. Ioſeph is yet aliue:
This was not food, but life to
him. The returne of Beniamin
was comfortable: but that his
dead ſonne was yet aliue after ſo
many yeeres lamentation, was tidings

too happy to bee beleeued,
and was enough to endanger
that life with exceſſe of ioy, which
the knowledge thereof doubled.
Ouer-excellent obiects are dangerous
in their ſudden apprehenſions.
One graine of that ioy
would haue ſafely cheared him,
whereof a full meaſure ouer-laies
his heart with too much ſweetneſſe.
There is no earthly pleaſure,
whereof wee may not ſurfet:
of the ſpirituall wee can neuer
haue enough.
                     Yet his eies reuiue his minde,
which his eares had thus aſtoniſhed.
When he ſaw the charets
of his ſonne, hee beloeued Ioſephs
life, and refreſhed his owne. He
had too much before, ſo that hee

could not enioy it: now he ſaith,
I haue enough, Ioſeph my ſonne is yet
aliue.
                     
                     They told him of his honour,
he ſpeakes of his life: life is better
than honour. To haue heard
that Ioſeph liued a ſeruant, would
haue ioied him more, than to
heare that hee died honourably.
The greater bleſſing obſcures the
leſſe. Hee is not worthy of honour
that is not thankfull for life.
                     Yet Ioſephs life did not content
Iacob without his preſence: (I will
go downe and ſee him ere I dye:) The
ſight of the eye is better then to
walke in deſires; Good things pleſure
vs not in their being, but in
our inioying.
                     
                        
The height of all earthly contentment
appeared in the meeting
of theſe two; whom their
mutuall loſſe had more endeared
to each other: The intermiſsion
of comforts hath this aduantage,
that it ſweetens our delight more
in the returne, then was abated in
the forbearance. God doth ofttimes
hide away our Ioſeph for a
time that wee may bee more ioyous
and thankfull in his recouery:
This was the ſincereſt pleaſure
that euer Iacob had, which therefore
God reſerued for his age.
                     And if the meeting of earthly
friends be ſo vnſpeakeably comfortable;
how happy ſhall we bee
in the ſight of the glorious face
of God our heauenly Father; of

that our bleſſed redeemer, whom
we ſold to death by our ſins, and
which now after that noble Triumph
hath all power giuen him
in heauen and in earth:
                     Thus did Iacob reioyce when he
was to go out of the land of promiſe
to a forreine nation for Ioſephs
ſake; being glad that hee
ſhould looſe his country for his
ſonne. What ſhall our ioy bee,
who muſt out of this forraine
land of our pilgrimage to the
home of our glorious inheritance,
to dwell with none but our own;
in that better and more lightſome
Goſhen-free from all the incombrances
of this Egypt, and full of
al the riches and delights of God?
The guilty conſcience can neuer

thinke it ſelfe ſafe: So many yeares
experience of Ioſephs loue could
not ſecure his brethren of remiſſion:
thoſe that know they haue
deſerued ill, are wont to miſinterpret
fauours, and think they cannot
be beloued: All that while, his
goodnes ſeemed but concealed,
and ſleeping malice; which they
feared in their Fathers laſt ſleepe
would awake and bewray it ſelfe
in reuenge: Still therefore they
plead the name of their Father,
though dead, not daring to vſe
their owne: Good meanings cannot
be more wronged, then with
ſuſpicion: It grieues Ioſeph to ſee
their feare, and to find they had
not forgotten their owne ſinne,
and to heare them ſo paſsionately
craue that which they had.
                     
                        
                        Forgiue the treſpaſſe of the ſeruants
of thy Fathers God:) What a coniuration
of pardon was this? What
wound could be either ſo deepe,
or ſo feſtered, as this plaſter could
not cure? They ſay not, the ſons
of thy Father, for they knew Iacob
was dead, and they had degenerated;
but the ſeruants of thy Fathers
God: How much ſtronger
are the bonds of religion, then of
nature: If Ioſeph had beene rancorous,
this deprecation had charmed
him; but now it reſolues him
into teares: They are not ſo ready
to acknowledge their old offence
as he to proteſt his loue; and if he
chide them for any thing, it is for
that they thought they needed
to intreat ſince they might know,
it could not ſtand with the fellow

ſeruant of their Fathers God to
harbour maliciouſneſſe, to purpoſe
reuenge. Am not I vnder
God? And fully to ſecure them; he
turnes their eyes from themſelues
to the decree of God, from the
action to the euent; as one that
would haue them thinke, there
was no cauſe to repent of that
which proued ſo ſuccesfull.
                     Euen late confeſsion findes forgiueneſſe;
Ioſeph had long agoe
ſeene their ſorrow, neuer but now
heard their humble acknowledgment;
Mercy ſtayes not for outward
ſolemnities. How much
more ſhall that infinite goodnes
pardon our ſinnes when he finds
the truth of our repentance.

Honourable IAMES,
Lord Hay: All
grace and happineſſe.
                  
                     RIGHT Honourable:
All that I can ſay for my
ſelfe is a deſire of dooing
good; which if it were
as feruent in richer hearts, that Church
which now we ſee comely, would then be
glorious: this honeſt ambition hath carried
me to neglect the feare of ſeeming
prodigall of my little: and while I ſee others
talents reſting in the earth, hath

drawne me to traffick with mine in publique.
I hope no aduenture that euer I
made of this kind ſhall bee equally gainfull
to this my preſent labour, wherein I
take Gods owne hiſtory for the ground,
and worke vpon it by what meditations
my weakeneſſe can afford. The diuinenes
of this ſubiect ſhall make more then
amends for the manifold defects of my
diſcourſe; although alſo the blame of an
imperfection is ſo much the more when
it lighteth vpon ſo high a choice. This
part which I offer to your Lordſhip ſhall
ſhew you Pharaoh impotently enuious
and cruell, the Iſraelites of friends become
ſlaues, puniſhed onely for proſpering;
Moſes in the weeds, in the court,
in the deſert, in the hill of viſions; a
Courtier in Aegypt, a ſhepheard in Midian,
an Ambaſſador from God, a leader
of Gods people, and when you ſee the

prodigious variety of the plagues of Aegypt
you ſhall not know whether more
to wonder at the miracles of Moſes, or
Pharaohs obſtinacy. Finally, you ſhall
ſee the ſame waues made both a wall &amp;
a gulfe in one boure; the Aegyptians
drowned, where no Iſraelite was wetſhod;
and if theſe paſſages yeeld not abundance
of profitable thoughts, impute
it (not without pardon) to the pouerty of
my weake conceit; which yet may perhaps
occaſion better vnto others. In all
humble ſubmiſsion I commend them
(what they are) to your Lordſhips fauourable
acceptation, and your ſelfe
with them, to the gratious bleſsing of
our God.
                  
                     Your Lordſhips in all dutifull
obſeruance at command.

BOOKE.
                  
                     The affliction of Iſraell.
                     
                        AEgypt was long an
harbour to the Iſraelites;
now it proues
a Iayle; the poſteritye
of Iacob findes
too late, what it was for their
forefathers to ſel Ioſeph, a ſlaue into
Egypt. Thoſe whom the Egyptians
honoured before as
Lords, they now contemne as

drudges: One Pharaoh aduances
whom another labors to depreſſe:
Not ſeldome the ſame
man changes copies, but if fauors
out-liue one age they proue decrepit
and hartleſſe: It is a rare
thing to finde poſterity heires of
their fathers loue: How ſhould
mens fauours bee but like themſelues,
variable and inconſtant?
there is no certainety but in the
fauour of God, in whom can
bee no change; whoſe loue is
entayled vpon a thouſand generations.
                     Yet if the Iſraelites had beene
trecherous to Pharaoh, if diſobedient,
this great change of
countenance had beene iuſt;
now the onely offence of Iſrael

is that he proſpereth; That
which ſhould bee the motiue of
their gratulation, and friendſhip,
is the cauſe of their malice. There
is no more hatefull ſight to a
wicked man then the proſperity
of the conſcionable; None but
the ſpirit of that true harbinger of
Chriſt can teach vs to ſay with
contentment, Hee muſt increaſe,
but I muſt decreaſe.
                     And what if Iſrael bee mightie
and rich? (If there be warre, they may
ioyne with our enemies, and get them out
of the land) Behold they are afraid
to part with thoſe whom they
are greeued to entertaine: Either
ſtaying or going is offence enough,
to thoſe that ſeeke quarrels;
There were no wars, and yet

they ſay (If there be wars) The Iſraelites
had neuer giuen cauſe of
feare to reuolt, and yet they ſay,
(Leaſt they ioyne to our enemies
to thoſe enemies which wee may
haue; So they make their certain
friends ſlaues, for feare of vncertaine
enemies. Wickednes is euer
cowardly, and full of vniuſt ſuſpitions;
it makes a man feare, where
no feare is, flye when none purſues
him. What difference there is
betwixt Dauid and Pharaoh; The
faith of the one ſaies, I will not
be afraid for tenne thouſand that
ſhould beſet me; The feare of the
other ſaies, Leſt if there be warre,
they ioyne with our enemies;
Therefore ſhould he haue made
much of the Iſraelites, that they
might bee his, his fauours might

haue made them firme; Why
might they not as wel draw their
ſwords for him?
                     Weake and baſe minds euer
incline to the worſe; and ſeeke
ſafety rather in an impoſsibility
of hurt, then in the likelihood of
iuſt aduantage: Fauors had bene
more binding then cruelties, yet
the fooliſh Egyptian had rather
haue impotent ſeruants, then able
friends. For their welfare alone
Pharaoh owes Iſrael a miſchiefe;
and how will he pay it?
                     (Come let vs worke wiſely;) Leud
men cal wicked policies wiſdom,
and their ſucceſſe happineſſe:
Herein Satan is wiſer, then they,
who both layes the plot, and

makes them ſuch fooles as to miſtake
villany and madneſſe, for
the beſt vertue.
                     Iniuſtice is vpheld by violence,
whereas iuſt gouernments are
maintained by loue: Taske-maſters
muſt be ſet ouer Iſrael; they
ſhould not be the true ſeed of Iſrael,
if they were not ſtill ſet to
wreſtle with God in afflictions:
Heauy burdens muſt be laid vpon
them: Iſrael is neuer but loaded,
the deſtiny of one of Iacobs
ſonnes is common to all. To lye
downe betwixt their burdens: If
they had ſeemed to breath them
in Goſhen ſometimes, yet euen
there it was no ſmall miſery to
be forrainers, and to liue among
Idolaters: But now the name of

a ſlaue is added to the name of a
ſtranger. Iſrael had gathered
ſome ruſt in idolatrous Egypt,
and now he muſt be ſcoured, they
had born the burden of Gods anger,
if they had not born the burdens
of the Egyptians.
                     As God afflicted them with another
mind then the Egyptians;
(God to exerciſe them, the Egyptians
to ſuppreſſe them;) ſo cauſes
hee the euent to differ. Who
would not haue thought with
theſe Egyptians, that ſo extreme
miſery ſhould not haue made the
Iſraelites vnfit both for generation
and reſiſtance; Moderate exerciſe
ſtrengthens, extreame deſtroyes
nature: That God which
many times workes by contrarie

means cauſed them to grow with
depreſsion, with perſecution to
multiply; How can Gods Church
but fare well, ſince the very malice
of their enemies benefits
them. O the Soueraigne goodnes
of our God that turnes all our
poyſons into cordials, Gods vine
beares the better with bleeding.
                     And now the Egyptians could
be angry with their owne maliciouſneſſe,
that this was the occaſion
of multiplying them whom
they hated, and feared; to ſee that
this ſeruice gained more to the
workmen, then to their maiſters;
The ſtronger therefore the Iſraelites
grew, the more impotent
grew them alice of their perſecutours.
And ſince their owne labor

ſtrengthens them, now tyranny
will try what can bee done
by the violence of others: Since
the preſent ſtrength cannot bee
ſubdued; the hopes of ſucceſsion
muſt be preuented: women muſt
bee ſuborned to bee murtherers,
and thoſe whoſe office is to help
the birth, muſt deſtroy it.
                     There was leſſe ſuſpition of cruelty
in that ſexe, and more oportunity
of doing miſchiefe. The
male children muſt be borne, and
dye at once; what can bee more
innocent then the child that hath
not liued ſo much as to cry, or to
ſee light? It is fault enough to bee
the ſon of an Iſraelite: the daughters
may liue for bondage, for luſt
a condition ſo much (at the leaſt)

woorſe then death, as their ſexe
was weaker. O maruellous cruelty
that a man ſhould kill a man,
for his ſexes ſake. Whoſoeuer
hath looſed the reynes vnto cruelty
is eaſily carryed into incredible
extremities.
                     From burdens they proceed to
bondage, and from bondange to
blood: from an vniuſt vexation of
their body, to an inhumane deſtruction
of the fruit of their body;
As the ſins of the concupiſcible
part, from ſleight motions
grow on to foule executions, ſo
doe thoſe of the iraſcible; there is
no ſinne whoſe harbour is more
vnſafe then of that of malice: But
oft times the power of tyrants
anſwers not their will; euill commanders

cannot alwaies meete
with equally miſchieuous agents.
                     The feare of God teaches the
mid wiues to diſobey an vniuſt
command; they well knew how
no excuſe it is for euill, I was bidden.
God ſaid to their harts, Thou
ſhalt not kill, This voice was louder
then Pharaohs. I commend their
obedience in diſobeying, I dare
not commend their excuſe, there
was as much weakeneſſe in their
anſwere, as ſtrength in their
practiſe: as they feared God in
not killing, ſo they feared Pharaoh
in diſſembling: oft times thoſe
that make conſcience of greater
ſins are ouertaken with leſſe. It is
wel and rare if we can come forth

of a dangerous action without any
ſoyle; and if we haue eſcaped
the ſtorme; that ſome after drops
wet vs not.
                     Who would not haue expected
that the midwiues ſhould
bee murthered for not murthering?
Pharaoh could not be ſo ſimple
to thinke theſe women truſty
yet his indignation had no power
to reach to their puniſhment
God proſpered the mid-wiues:
who can harme them? Euen the
not dooing of euill is rewarded
with good. And why did they
proſper? Becauſe they feared
God; Not for their diſsimulation
but their pietie. So did God regard
their mercie, that he ragarded
not their infirmitie. How

fondly do men lay the thank vpon
the ſin which is due to the vertue:
true wiſedome teaches to diſtinguiſh
Gods actions, and to aſcribe
them to the right cauſes:
Pardon belongs to the lye of the
Midwiues, remuneration to their
goodnes, proſperity to their fear
of God.
                     But that which the Midwiues
will not, the multitudes ſhall do;
It were ſtrange if wicked rulers
ſhould not finde ſome or other
inſtruments of violence: all the
people muſt drowne whom the
women ſaued; Cruelty hath but
ſmoked before, now it flames vp;
ſecret practiſing hath made it
ſhameleſſe, that now it dare proclaime
tyranny. It is a miſerable

ſtate where euery man is made
an executioner: there can bee no
greater argument of an ill cauſe
then a bloody proſecution, wheras
truth vpholds herſelfe by mildneſſe,
and is promoted by patience.
This is their act, what was
their iſſue? the people muſt drown
their males, themſelues are drowned:
they died by the ſame means
by which they cauſed the poore
Iſraelitiſh infants to dye; that law
of retaliation which God will not
allow to vs, becauſe we are fellow
creatures, hee iuſtly practiſeth in
vs. God would haue vs reade our
ſinnes in our iudgements, that we
might both repent of our ſinnes;
and giue glory to his iuſtice.
                     
                        Pharaoh raged before, much

more now that hee receiued a
meſſage of diſmiſsion: the monitions
of God make ill men worſe:
the waues doe not beat nor roare
any where ſo much as at the
banke which reſtraines them.
Corruption when it is checked,
growes madde with rage. As the
vapour in a cloud would not
make that fearefull report, if it
met not with oppoſition. A good
heart yeelds at the ſtilleſt voice of
God: but the moſt gratious motions
of God harden the wicked.
Many would not be ſo deſperately
ſettled in their ſinnes, if the
word had not controlled them.
How milde a meſſage was this to
Pharaoh, and yet how galling?
Wee pray thee let vs goe. God commands
him that which hee feared.

Hee tooke pleaſure in the
preſent ſeruitude of Iſrael: God
cals for a releaſe. If the ſuit had
beene for mitigation of labour,
for preſeruation of their children,
it might haue caried ſome hope,
and haue found ſome fauour, but
now God requires that which he
knows will as much diſcontent
Pharaoh as Pharaohs cruelty could
diſcontent the Iſraelites (Let vs
goe) How contrary are Gods precepts
to naturall minds? And indeed,
as they loue to croſſe him
in their practiſe; ſo hee loues to
croſſe them in their commands
before, &amp; his puniſhments afterward;
It is a dangerous ſigne of
an ill heart to feele Gods yoake
heauy.
                     
                        Moſes talkes of ſacrifice, Pharaoh
                        
talkes of worke. Any thing
ſeemes due worke to a carnall
minde, ſauing Gods ſeruice: nothing
ſuperfluous, but religious
duties. Chriſt tels vs there is but
one thing neceſſarie: nature tels
vs there is nothing but that, needleſſe.
Moſes ſpeakes of deuotion,
Pharaoh of idleneſſe. It hath beene
an old vſe, as to caſt faire colours
vpon our owne vicious actions,
ſo to caſt euill a
                           •
                        perſions vpon
the good actions of others. The
ſame Diuell that ſpoke in Pharaoh,
ſpeakes ſtill in our ſcoffers, and
cals religion hypocriſie, conſcionable
care, ſingularitie. Euery
vice hath a title, and euery vertue
a diſgrace.
                     Yet while poſſible taskes were

impoſed, there was ſome comfort.
Their diligence might ſaue
their backes from ſtripes. The
conceit of a benefit to the commander,
and hope of impunitie
to the labourer, might giue a
good pretence to great difficulties:
but to require taskes not faiſible,
is tyrannicall, and doth
onely picke a quarrell to puniſh.
They could neither make ſtraw,
nor finde it, yet they muſt haue
it. Doe what may be, is tolerable;
but doe what cannot bee, is
cruell. Thoſe which are aboue
others in place, muſt meaſure
their commands, not by their
owne wils, but by the ſtrength of
their inferiors. To require more
of a beaſt than he can doe, is inhumane.
The taske is not done:

the taske-maſters are beaten:
the puniſhment lies where the
charge is; they muſt exact it of
the people, Pharaoh of them. It
is the miſerie of thoſe which are
truſted with authoritie, that their
inferiours faults are beaten vpon
their backes. This was not the
fault to require it of the taskemaſters,
but to require it by the
taske-maſters, of the people.
Publike perſons doe either good
or ill with a thouſand hands, and
with no fewer ſhall receiue it.
                  
                  
                     
                     The birth and breediug of
Moſes.
                     IT is a wonder that Amram the
father of Moſes; would think of
the marriage bed in ſo troubleſome
a times when he knew hee
ſhould beget children either to
ſlauery, or ſlaughter: yet euen
now in the heat of this bondage▪
he marries Iochebed▪
                         the drowning
of his ſonnes was not ſo great an
euill, as his owne burning; the
thraldom of his daughters not ſo
great an euill, as the ſubiection
vnto ſinfull deſires. He therefore
vſes Gods remedy for his ſinne;
and refers the ſequell of his danger

to God. How neceſſary is his
imitation for thoſe which haue
not the power of containing?
Perhaps we would haue thought
it better to liue childleſſe: but
Amram and Iochebed durſt not incurre
the danger of a ſinne, to auoid
the danger of a miſchiefe.
No doubt when Iochebed the mother
of Moſes ſaw a man-childe
borne of her, and him beautifull
and comely, ſhe ſell into extreme
paſſion, to thinke that the executioners
hand ſhould ſucceede the
Mid-wiues. All the time of her
conception, ſhee could not but
feare a ſonne; now ſhee ſees him,
and thinks of his birth and death
at once; her ſecond throwes are
more grieuous than her firſt. The
paines of trauell in others are

ſomewhat mitigated with hope,
and counteruailed with ioy that a
man-child is borne; in her they
are doubled with feare; the remedie
of others is her complaint: ſtill
ſhee lookes when ſome fierce Egyptian
would come in, &amp; ſnatch
her new-borne infant out of her
boſome; whoſe comelineſſe had
now alſo added to her affection.
                     Many times God writes preſages
of Maieſtie and honour, euen
in the faces of children. Little did
ſhee thinke, that ſhee held in her
lappe the deliuerer of Iſrael. It is
good to hazard in greateſt appearances
of danger. If Iochebed had
ſaid, If I beare a ſon they will kill
him, where had beene the great
reſcuer of Iſrael? Happie is that

reſolution which can follow God
hood-winkt, and let him diſpoſe
of the euent: When ſhee can no
longer hide him in her wombe,
ſhe hides him in her houſe; afraid
leſt euery of his cryings ſhould
guide the executioner to his cradle.
And now ſhe ſees her treaſure
can be no longer hid, ſhee
ſhips him in a barke of bulruſhes,
and commits him to the mercy of
the waues, and (which was more
mercileſſe) to the danger of an
Egyptian paſſenger, yet doth ſhe
not leaue him without a gardian.
                     No tyrannie can forbid her to
loue him, whom ſhee is forbidden
to keepe: Her daughters eies
muſt ſupply the place of her arms
and if the weake affection of a

mother were thus effectually
carefull, what ſhall wee thinke of
him whoſe loue, whoſe compaſſion
is (as himſelfe) infinite? His
eie, his hand cannot but be with
vs, euen when wee forſake our
ſelues: Moſes had neuer a ſtronger
protection about him, no not
when all his Iſraelites were pitched
about his tent in the wilderneſſe,
than now when he lay
ſprauling alone vpon the waues:
No water, no Egyptian can hurt
him. Neither friend nor mother
dare owne him, and now God
challenges his cuſtodie. When
wee ſeeme moſt neglected, and
forlorne in our ſelues, then is
God moſt preſent, moſt vigilant.
                     His prouidence brings Pharaohs
                        
daughter thither to waſh her
ſelfe. Thoſe times looke for no
great ſtate: A Princeſſe comes to
bath her ſelfe in the open ſtream:
ſhe meant only to waſh her ſelfe,
God fetches her thither to deliuer
the deliuerer of his people.
His deſignes goe beyond ours.
We know not (when wee ſet our
foot ouer our threſhold) what
hee hath to doe with vs. This
euent ſeemed caſuall to this Princeſſe,
but predetermined, and
prouided by God, before ſhee
was: how wiſely and ſweetly God
brings to paſſe his owne purpoſes
in our ignorance and regardleſneſſe.
She ſaw the Arke, opens
it, findes the childe weeping; his
beautie and his teares had God
prouided for the ſtrong perſwaſions

of mercy. This yoong and
liuely Oratorie preuailed. Her
heart is ſtroke with compaſſion,
and yet her tongue could ſay, it
is an Hebrewes childe.
                     See heere the mercifull daughter
of a cruell father: It is an vncharitable
and iniurious ground
to iudge of the childs diſpoſition
by the parents. How well doth
pitie beſeeme great perſonages?
and moſt in extremities. It had
beene death to another to reſcue
the childe of an Hebrew; in her,
it was ſafe and noble. It is an
happie thing when great ones
improue their places to ſo much
more charitie as their libertie is
more.
                     
                        Moſes his ſiſter finding the princeſſe

compaſſionate, offers to
procure a nurſe, and fetches the
mother, and who can bee ſo fit a
nurſe as a mother? She now with
glad hands receiues her childe,
both with authority and reward.
She would haue giuen al her ſubſtance
for the life of her ſonne;
and now ſhee hath a reward to
nurſe him. The exchange of the
name of a mother for the name
of a nurſe hath gained her both
her ſonne, and his education, and
with both, a recompence. Religion
doth not call vs to a weake
ſimplicity, but allows vs as much
of the ſerpent, as of the Doue:
Lawfull policies haue from God
both libertie in the vſe and bleſſing
in the ſucceſſe.
                     The good Ladie did not breed

him as ſome childe of almes, or as
ſome wretched outcaſt for whom
it might be fauor enough to liue;
but as her owne ſonne. In all the
delicacies, in all the learning of
Egypt. Whatſoeuer the Court, or
the Schoole could put into him,
he wanted not; yet all this could
not make him forget that he was
and Hebrew. Education workes
wondrous changes, and is of great
force either way, a little aduancement
hath ſo puffed vp ſome aboue
themſelues, that they haue
not only forgot their friends, but
ſcorned their parents. All the honours
of Egypt could not winne
Moſes not to call his nurſe, mother:
or weane him from a willing
miſerie with the Iſraelites.
If we had Moſes his faith, we could

not but make his choice. It is
onely our infidelity that bindes
vs ſo faſt to the world, and makes
vs preferre the momentany pleaſures
of ſinne, vnto that euerlaſting
recompence of reward.
                     Hee went foorth and looked
on the burdens of Iſrael. What
needed Moſes to haue afflicted
himſelfe with the afflictions of
others? Himſelfe was at eaſe and
pleaſure in the Court of Pharaoh.
A good heart cannot abide to be
happy alone; and muſt needes,
vnbidden, ſhare with others in
their miſeries. He is no true Moſes
that is not mooued with the
calamities of Gods Church. To
ſee an Egyptian ſmite an Hebrew,
it ſmote him, and mooued him

to ſmite. Hee hath no Iſraelitiſh
blood in him, that can endure
to ſee an Iſraelite ſtriken either
with hand or tongue.
                     Heere was his zeale: where
was his authoritie? Doubtleſſe
Moſes had an inſtinct from God
of his magiſtracie; elſe how
ſhould hee thinke they would
haue vnderſtood what himſelfe
did not? Oppreſſions may not
bee righted by violence, but by
law. The redreſſe of euill by a
perſon vnwarranted, is euill. Moſes
knew that God had called
him, he knew that Pharaoh knew
it not: therefore he hides the Egyptian
in the ſand. Thoſe actions
which may bee approoued
vnto God, are not alwaies ſafe

with men: as contrarily, too many
things goe currant with men,
that are not approoued of God.
                     Another Hebrew is ſtrucken,
but by an Hebrew: the act is the
ſame, the agents differ: neither
doth their profeſſion more differ,
than Moſes his proceedings.
Hee giues blowes to the one: to
the other, words. The blowes
to the Egyptian were deadly; the
words to the Hebrew, gentle and
plauſible. As God makes a difference
betwixt chaſtiſements of
his owne, and puniſhments of
ſtrange children: So muſt wiſe
gouernours learne to diſtinguiſh
of ſinnes and iudgements, according
to circumſtances. How
mildly doth Moſes admoniſh?

Sirs, yee are brethren. If there
had beene but any dramme of
good nature in theſe Hebrewes,
they had relented: now it is
ſtrange to ſee that being ſo vniuerſally
vexed with their common
aduerſarie, they ſhould yet
vex one another: One would
haue thought that a common
oppoſition ſhould haue vnited
them more, yet now priuate
grudges doe thus dangerouſly
diuide them. Blowes enow were
not dealt by the Egyptians, their
owne muſt adde to the violence.
Still Satan is thus buſie, and Chriſtians
are thus malicious, that (as
if they wanted enemies) they flie
in one anothers faces. While we
are in this Egypt of the world, all
vnkinde ſtrifes would eaſily bee

compoſed if wee did not forget
that wee are brethren.
                     Behold an Egyptian in the
skinne of an Hebrew: How dogged
an anſwer doth Moſes receiue
to ſo gentle a reproofe? Who
would not haue expected that
this Hebrew had beene enough
deiected with the common affliction?
But vexations may make
ſome more miſerable, not more
humble. As wee ſee ſickeneſſes
make ſome tractable, others
more froward; It is no eaſie
matter to beare a reproofe
well; if neuer ſo well tempered;
no ſugar can bereaue a pill
of his bitterneſſe: None but the
gracious can ſay, Let the righteous
ſmite me.
                     
                     
                        
Next to the not deſeruing a reproofe
is the well taking of it. But
who is ſo ready to except and exclaime
as the wrong-doer? The
patient replies not. One iniurie
drawes on another, firſt to his
brother, then to his reproouer.
Guiltineſſe will make a man ſtirre
vpon euery touch: hee that was
wronged, could incline to reconciliation:
Malice makes men vncapable
of good counſell; and
there are none ſo great enemies
to iuſtice, as thoſe which are enemies
to peace.
                     With what impatience doth a
galled heart receiue an admonition?
This vnworthy Iſraelite is
the patterne of a ſtomackfull offender,
firſt he is moued to choller

in himſelf: then he cals for the
authoritie of the admoniſher: A
ſmal authoritie will ſerue for a louing
admonition. It is the duty of
men, much more of Chriſtians to
aduiſe againſt ſinne; yet this man
askes who made thee a Iudge, for
but finding fault with his iniury▪
Then, hee aggrauates, and miſconſtrues;
Wilt thou kill mee?
when Moſes meant onely to ſaue
both. It was the death of his malice
onely that was intended and
the ſafety of his perſon. And laſtly
he vpbraids with former actions;
Thou killedſt the Egyptian:
What if he did? What if vniuſtly?
What was this to the Hebrew?
Another mans ſinne is no excuſe
for ours: A wicked heart neuer
lookes inward to it ſelfe, but outward

to the quality of the reprouer
if that affoord exception, it is
enough. As a dog runs firſt to reuenge
on the ſtone: what matter
is it to me who he be that admoniſhes
me: let me look home into
my ſelf: let me look to his aduiſe.
If that be good, it is more ſhame
to me to be reprooued by an euill
man. As a good mans allowance
cannot warrant euill, ſo an euill
mans reproofe may remedy euill:
If this Hebrew had bin well pleaſed,
Moſes had not heard of his
ſlaughter; Now in choller all will
out; And if this mans tongue had
not thus caſt him in the teeth
with blood, he had beene ſurpriſed
by Pharaoh, ere he could haue
known that the fact was known.
                     Now he growes iealous, flees

and eſcapes No friend is ſo commodious
in ſome eaſes as an aduerſary;
This wound which the
Hebrew thought to giue Moſes,
ſaued his life. As it is good for a
man to haue an enemy, ſo it ſhall
be our wiſedome to make vſe of
his moſt cholericke obiections.
The woorſt of an enemy, may
prooue moſt ſoueraigne to our
ſelues. Moſes flees, It is no diſcomfort
for a man to flee when his
conſcience purſues him not:
Where Gods warrant will not
protect vs, it is good for the
heeels to ſupply the place of the
tongue.
                     
                        Moſes when he may not in Egipt,
he will be doing iuſtice in Midian.
In Egypt hee deliuers the oppreſſed

Iſraelite. In Midian the
wronged daughters of Iethro. A
good man will be doing good,
whereſoeuer he is; His trade is a
compound of charity and iuſtice
as therfore euill diſpoſitions cannot
bee changed with ayres, no
more will good. Now then hee
ſits him downe by a well in Midian.
There hee might haue to
drinke, but where to eat he knew
not. The caſe was altered with
Moſes, to come from the dainties
of the court of Egypt, to the hunger
of the fields of Midian: It is a
leſſon that al Gods children muſt
learne to take out, to want and to
abound. Who can thinke ſtrange
of penury, when the great gouernour
of Gods people once hath
nothing? Who would not haue

thought in this caſe, Moſes ſhould
haue bene hartleſſe and ſullen; ſo
caſt downe with his owne complaints,
that he ſhould haue had
no feeling of others; yet how
hote is hee vpon iuſtice? No aduerſitie
can make a good man
neglect good duties, hee ſees the
oppreſsion of the ſhepheards,
the image of that other hee left
behind him in Egypt: The maids,
(daughters of ſo great a peere)
draw water for their flockes, the
inhumane ſhepherds driue them
away; rudeneſſe hath no reſpect
either to ſexe, or condition; If we
liued not vnder lawes this were
our caſe; Might would bee the
meaſure of iuſtice: we ſhould not
ſo much as enioy our owne water:
vniuſt courſes will not euer

proſper: Moſes ſhall rather come
from Egypt to Midian to beate
the ſhepheards, then they ſhall
vexe the daughters of Iethro: This
act of iuſtice was not better done
than taken. Reuel requites it kindly
with an hoſpitall entertainement.
A good nature is ready to
anſwer courteſies: we cannot do
too much for a thankfull man.
And if a courteous heathen reward
the watering of a ſheepe in
this bountifull manner, how ſhal
our God recompence but a cup
of cold water, that is giuen to a
diſciple? This ſauor hath wonne
Moſes, who now conſents to dwel
with him, though out of the
Church. Curioſitie or whatſoeuer
idle occaſions may not draw
vs (for our reſidence) out of the

bounds of the Church of God:
danger of life may; wee loue not
the Church if wee eaſily leaue it:
if in a caſe of life, we leaue it not
(vpon opportunitie) for a time of
reſpite, wee loue not our ſelues.
The worſt part of Moſes his requitall
was his wife, one of thoſe
whom he had formerly protected.
                     I doe not ſo much maruell
that Iethro gaue him his daughter
(for he ſaw him valiant, wiſe, learned,
nobly bred) as that Moſes
would take her; a ſtranger, both
in blood and religion. I could
plead for him neceſſitie: his own
nation was ſhut vp to him; if hee
would haue tried to fetch a
daughter of Iſrael, he had endangered

to leaue himſelfe behinde.
I could pleade ſome correſpondence
in common principles of
religion; for doubtleſſe Moſes his
zeale could not ſuffer him to
ſmother the truth in himſelfe: he
ſhould haue beene an vnfaithfull
ſeruant, if hee had not beene his
maſters teacher. Yet neither of
theſe can make this match either
ſafe, or good. The euent bewraies
it dangerouſly inconuenient.
This choice had like to haue
coſt him deare: ſhee ſtood in his
way for circumciſion; God ſtands
in his way for reuenge. Though
he was now in Gods meſſage, yet
might he not be for borne in this
neglect. No circumſtance, either
of the deareneſſe of the ſolicitour▪
or our owne ingagement,

can beare out a ſinne with God:
Thoſe which are vnequally yoked,
may not euer looke to draw
one way. True loue to the perſon
cannot long agree with diſlike
of the religion. He had need
to be more than a man, that hath
a Zipporah in his boſome, and
would haue true zeale in his hart.
All this while Moſes his affection
was not ſo tied to Midian, that he
could forget Egypt. Hee was a
ſtranger in Midian: what was he
elſe in Egypt? Surely either Egypt
was not his home, or a miſerable
one; and yet in reference
to it, he cals his ſonne Gerſhom, a
ſtranger there. Much better was
it to bee a ſtranger there, than a
dweller in Egypt. How hardly
can we forget the place of our abode

or education, although neuer
ſo homely? And if hee ſo
thought of his Egyptian home,
where was nothing but bondage
and tyrannie, how ſhould wee
thinke of that home of ours,
aboue, where is nothing but
reſt and bleſſedneſſe?
                  
                  
                     Moſes called.
                     FOrty yeeres was Moſes a courtier,
and forty yeres (after that)
a ſhepheard: That great men may
not be aſhamed of honeſt vocations,
the greateſt that euer were
haue beene content to take vp
with meane trades. The contempt
of honeſt callings in thoſe

which are well borne, argues
pride, without wit: How conſtantly
did Moſes ſticke to his
hooke? and yet a man of great
ſpirits, of excellent learning, of
curious education, and if God,
had not (after his forty yeeres ſeruice)
called him off, he had ſo ended
his daies. Humble reſolutions
are ſo much more heroical, as
they fall into higher ſubiects.
                     There can be no fitter diſpoſition
for a leader of Gods people,
then conſtancy in his vndertakings,
without either wearineſſe,
or change. How had he learned
to ſubdue all ambitious deſires,
and to reſt content with his obſcurity.
So hee might haue the
freedome of his thoughts, and

full opportunity of holy meditations,
hee willingly leaues the
world to others, and enuies not
his proudeſt acquaintance of the
Court of Pharaoh. Hee that hath
true worth in himſelfe, and familiarity
with God, finds more pleaſure
in the deſers of Midian, then
others can doe in the pallaces of
Kings.
                     Whiles he is tending his ſheep,
God appeared vnto him, God
neuer graces the ydle with his
viſions; when hee findes vs in
our callings, we find him in the
tokens of his mercy: Satan appeares
to the idle man in manifold
tentations, or rather preſents
himſelfe, and appeares not. God
was euer with Moſes, yet was hee
not ſeene till now. Hee is neuer

abſent from his, but ſometimes
he makes their ſenſes witneſſes of
his preſence. In ſmal matters may
be great wonders. That a buſh
ſhould burne is no maruell, but
that it ſhold not conſume in burning,
is iuſtly miraculous: God
chooſeth not euer great ſubiects
wherein to exerciſe his power.
It is enough that his power is
great in the ſmalleſt.
                     When I looke vpon this burning
buſh with Moſes, me thinks
I can neuer ſee a woorthier, and
more liuely Embleme of the
Church; That in Egypt was the
furnace yet waſted not. Since then
how oft hath it bene flaming, neuer
conſumed. The ſame power
that enlightens it, preſerues it:

and to none but his enemies is he
a conſuming fire; Moſes was a
great Philoſopher, but ſmall skill
would haue ſerued to know the
nature of fire, and of the buſh:
that fire meeting with combuſtible
matter could not but cōſume:
If it had beene ſome ſolid woood
it would haue yeelded later to the
flame; but buſhes are of ſo quick
diſpatch, that the ioy of the wicked
is compared to a fire of thorns.
Hee noted it a while, ſaw it continued,
&amp; began to wonder. It was
ſome maruel how it ſhould come
there; but how it ſhould continue
without ſupply, yea without diminution
of matter, was truely
admirable: Doubtleſſe hee went
oft about it, and viewed it on all
ſides, and now when his eye and

mind could meete with no likely
cauſes, ſo farre off, reſolues, I
will go ſee it; His curioſity ledde
him neerer, and what could hee
ſee but a buſh and a flame which
hee ſaw at firſt vnſatisfied? It is
good to come to the place of
Gods preſence, howſoeuer; God
may perhaps ſpeake to thy heart,
though thou come but for nouelty:
Euen thoſe which haue come
vpon curioſity haue beene oft taken:
Abſence is without hope; If
Moſes had not come, hee had not
beene called out of the buſh.
                     To ſee a fire not conſuming
the buſh, was much; but to heere
a ſpeaking fire, this was more; and
to heare his own name out of the
mouth of the fire, it was moſt of

all. God makes way for his greateſt
meſſages by aſtoniſhment
and admiration: as on the contrary,
careleſnes carries vs to a more
proficiency vnder the beſt means
of God: If our hearts were more
awfull, Gods meſſages would bee
more effectuall to vs.
                     In that appearance God meant
to cal Moſes to come; yet when he
is come inhibits him; (Come not hither)
We muſt come to God, wee
muſt not come too neere him,
when wee meditate of the great
myſteries of his word, wee come
to him: wee come too neere him
when we ſearch into his counſels.
The Sunne and the fire ſay of
themſelues, Come not too neere,
how much more the light which

none can attaine vnto? We haue
all our limits ſet vs: The Gentiles
might come into ſome outer
courts, not into the inmoſt: The
Iewes might come into the inner
Court, not into the Temple: the
Prieſts and Leuites into the Temple,
not into the Holy of Holies;
Moſes to the hill, not to the buſh.
The waues of the ſea had not
more need of bounds, than mans
preſumption. Moſes muſt not
come cloſe to the buſh at all; and
where he may ſtand, he may not
ſtand with his ſhooes on. There
is no vnholineſſe in clothes: God
prepared them for man at firſt,
and that of skins▪ leſt any exception
ſhould be taken at the hides
of dead beaſts. This rite was ſignificant.
What are the ſhooes

but worldly and carnall affections?
If theſe be not caſt off when
wee come to the holy place, wee
make our ſelues vnholy▪ how
much leſſe ſhold we dare to come
with reſolutions of ſinne? This is
not onely to come with ſhooes
on, but with ſhooes bemired
with wicked filthineſſe; the touch
whereof profanes the pauement
of God, and makes our preſence
odious.
                     
                        Moſes was the ſonne of Amram,
Amram of Kohath, Kohath of Leui,
Leui of Iacob, Iacob of Iſaac, Iſaac of
Abraham. God puts together
both ends of his pedigree, I am
the God of thy father, and of Abraham,
Iſaac, Iacob. If he had ſaid
only, I am thy God, it had beene

                        Moſes his duty to attend awfully;
but now that hee ſaies I am the
God of thy Father, and of Abraham
&amp;c. He challenges reuerence
by preſcription. Any thing that
was our Anceſtors, pleaſes vs;
their houſes; their veſſels, their
cote-armour; How much more
their God? How carefull ſhould
parents be to make holy choiſes?
Euery precedent of theirs are ſo
many monuments and motiues
to their poſteritie. What an happineſſe
it is to bee borne of good
parents: hence God claimes an
intereſt in vs, and wee in him, for
their ſake. As many a man ſmarteth
for his fathers ſinne, ſo the
goodneſſe of others is crowned
in a thouſand generations. Neither
doth God ſay, I was the God

of Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob; but, I am.
The Patriarkes ſtill liue after ſo
many thouſand yeeres of diſſolution.
No length of time can
ſeparate the ſoules of the iuſt
from their maker. As for their
bodie, there is ſtill a reall relation
betwixt the duſt of it, and the
ſoule: and if the being of this
part be more defectiue, the being
of the other is more liuely, and
doth more than recompence the
wants of that earthly halfe.
                     God could not deſcribe himſelfe
by a more ſweet name than
this, I am the God of thy father,
and of Abraham, &amp;c. yet Moſes
hides his face for feare. If hee
had ſaid, I am the glorious God
that made heauen and earth, that

dwell in light inacceſſible, whom
the Angels cannot behold; or, I
am God the auenger, iuſt and
terrible, a conſuming fire to mine
enemies, heere had beene iuſt
cauſe of terrour.
                     But 
                           •
                        hy was Moſes ſo frighted
with a familiar compellation?
God is no leſſe awfull to his owne
in his very mercies. Great is thy
mercie that thou maiſt be feared:
for to them, no leſſe maieſtie
ſhines in the fauours of God,
than in his iudgements and iuſtice.
The wicked heart neuer
feares God but thundring, or
ſhaking the earth▪ or raining fire
from heauen; but the good can
dread him in his very ſun-ſhine:
his louing deliuerances and bleſſings

affect them with awfulnes
Moſes was the true ſonne of Iacob,
who when hee ſaw nothing but
viſions of loue and mercy, could
ſay, How dreadfull is this place?
                     I ſee Moſes now at the buſh hiding
his face at ſo milde 
                           •
                         repreſentation:
heereafter we ſhall ſee
him in this very mount betwixt
heauen and earth, in thunder,
lightning, ſmoke, earth-quakes,
ſpeaking mouth to mouth with
God, bare faced, and feareleſſe:
God was then more terrible, but
Moſes was leſſe ſtrange. This was
his firſt meeting with God; further
acquaintance makes him familiar,
and familiarity makes him
bold: Frequence of conuerſation
giues vs freedome of acceſſe to

God; and makes vs poure out
our hearts to him as fully and as
feareleſly as to our friends. In the
meane time now at firſt he made
not ſo much haſte to ſee, but hee
made as much to hide his eies:
Twice did Moſes hide his face;
once for the glory which God
put vpon him, which made him
ſo ſhine, that hee could not bee
beheld of others; once for Gods
owne glory, which he could not
behold. No maruell. Some of
the creatures are too glorious for
mortall eies: how much more
when God appeares to vs in the
eaſieſt manner, muſt his glorie
needs ouercome vs? Behold the
difference betwixt our preſent,
and future eſtate: Then, the more
maieſtie of appearance, the more

delight: when our ſinne is quite
gone, all our feare at Gods preſence
ſhall be turned into ioy.
God appeared to Adam before his
ſinne with comfort, but in the
ſame forme which after his ſinne
was terrible. And if Moſes cannot
abide to looke vpon Gods glory
when he deſcends to vs in mercy,
how ſhall wicked ones abide to
ſee his fearefull preſence when
he ſets vpon vengeance. In this
fire hee flamed and conſumed
not, but in his reuenge our God
is a conſuming fire.
                     Firſt Moſes hides himſelfe in
feare, now in modeſtie. Who
am I? None in all Egypt or Midian
was comparably fit for this
embaſſage. Which of the Iſraelites

had beene brought vp a
Courtier, a ſcholar, an Iſraelite
by blood, by education an Egyptian
learned, wiſe, valiant, experienced?
Yet, Who am I? The
more fit any man is for whatſoeuer
vocation, the leſſe he thinkes
himſelfe. Forwardneſſe argues
inſufficiencie. The vnworthie
thinkes ſtill, Who am I not? Modeſt
beginnings giue hopefull
proceedings, and happy endings.
Once before, Moſes had taken
vpon him, and laid about him;
hoping then they would haue
knowen that by his hand God
meant to deliuer Iſrael: but now
when it comes to the point, Who
am I? Gods beſt ſeruants are not
euer in an equall diſpoſition to
good duties. If wee finde differences

in our ſelues ſometimes,
it argues that grace is not our
owne. It is our frailtie, that
thoſe ſeruices which wee are forward
to, aloofe off, wee ſhrinke
at, neere hand, and fearefully
miſſe-giue. How many of vs
can bid defiances to death, and
ſuggeſt anſwers to abſent tentations,
which when they come
home to vs, wee flie off, and
change our note, and inſtead of
action, expoſtulate?
                  
                  
                     
                     The plagues of Egypt.
                     IT is too much honour for fleſh
and blood to receiue a meſſage
from heauen, yet here God ſends
a meſſage to man, and is repulſed:
well may God aske, who is man
that I ſhould regard him, but for
man to aske who is the Lorde, is
a bolde and proud blaſphemy.
Thus wilde is nature at the firſt;
but ere God haue done with Pharaoh,
he will be knowne of him, he
will make himſelfe knowne by
him, to all the world: God might
haue ſwept him away ſuddenly.
How vnworthy is he of life, who
with the ſame breath that hee receiues,

denies the giuer of it: But
he would haue him conuinced,
ere he were puniſhed; Firſt therefore
hee workes miracles before
him, then vpon him. Pharaoh was
now from a ſtaffe of protection
and ſuſtentation to Gods people,
turned to a ſerpent that ſtung
them to death; God ſhewes him
himſelfe in this reall embleme;
doing that ſuddenly before him,
which Satan had wrought in him
by leaſure; And now when hee
crawles and winds, and hiſſes,
threatning perill to Iſrael, hee
ſhewes him how in an inſtant, he
can turne him into a ſenceleſſe
ſticke, and make him if not vſefull,
yet feareleſſe: The ſame God
which wrought this, giues Satan
leaue to imitate it; the firſt plague

that he ment to inflict vpon Pharaoh,
is deluſion: God can be content
the Diuell ſhould win himſelfe
credit, where hee meanes to
iudge, and holds the honour of a
miracle well loſt, to harden an enemy,
Yet to ſhow that his miracle
was of power, the others of
permiſsion; Moſes his ſerpent deuours
theirs; how eaſily might
the Egyptians haue thought, that
he which cauſed their ſerpent not
to be, could haue kept it from being,
and that they which could
not keepe their Serpent from deuouring,
could not ſecure them
from being conſumed; but wiſe
thoughts enter not into thoſe
that muſt periſh. All Gods iudgements
ſtand ready, and waite but
till they be called for. They need

but a watch-word to bee giuen
them: No ſooner is the rodde lift
vp, but they are gone forth into
the world, preſently the waters
runne into bloud, the frogs and
lice craule about, and al the other
troupes of God come ruſhing in
vpon his aduerſaries: All creatures
conſpire to reuenge the iniuries
of God. If the Egyptians
looke vpward, there they haue
thunder, lightning, hayle, tempeſts,
one while no light at all, another
while ſuch fearfull flaſhes
as had more terror, then darknes.
If they looke vnder them, there
they ſee their waters changed into
blood, their earth ſwarming
with frogs and graſſehoppers: If
about them, one while the flyes
fill both their eyes and eares, another

while they ſee their fruites
deſtroyed, their cattell dying,
their children dead. If laſtly they
looke vpon themſelues, they ſee
themſelues loathſome with lice,
painful and deformed with ſcabs,
biles and botches.
                     Firſt God begins his iudgement
with the waters. As the riuer of
Nilus was to Egypt in ſteed of
heauen to moiſten and fatten the
earth; ſo their confidence was
more in it then in heauen; Men
are ſure to bee puniſht moſt and
ſooneſt, in that which they make
a corriuall with God. They had
before defiled the riuers with the
bloud of innocents; and now it
appeares to them, in his owne
colour. The waters will no longer

keepe their counſell: Neuer
any man delighted in blood,
which had not enough of it, ere
his end: they ſhed but ſome few
ſtreames, and now behold whole
riuers of blood: Neither was this
more a monument of their
ſlaughter, paſt, then an image of
their future deſtruction. They
were afterwards ouerwhelmed
in the redde ſea, and now beforehand
they ſee their riuers redde
with blood. How dependant
and ſeruile is the life of man, that
cannot either want one element,
or endure it corrupted; It is hard
to ſay whether there were more
horrour, or annoyance in this
plague. They complain of thirſt,
and yet doubt whether they
ſhould dye, or quench it with

bloud. Their fiſh (the chiefe part
of their ſuſtenance) dyes with infection,
and infecteth more by
being dead. The ſtench of both
is ready to poyſon the inhabitants;
yet Pharaohs curioſity carries
him away quite from the
ſenſe of the iudgement, hee had
rather ſend for his magicians to
worke feats, then to humble himſelfe
vnder God for the remooual
of this plague; And God plagues
his curioſity with deceipt, thoſe
whom he truſts, ſhall vndoe him
with preuailing; the glory of a
ſecond miracle ſhall be obſcured
by a falſe imitation, for a greater
glory to God in the ſequell.
                     The rod is lift vp againe, Behold,
that Nilus which they had

before adored, was neuer ſo beneficiall
as it is now troubleſome;
yeelding them not onely a dead,
but a liuing annoyance: It neuer
did ſo ſtore them with fiſh, as
now it plagues them with frogs;
Whatſoeuer any man makes his
God, beſides the true one, ſhall
bee once his tormenter. Thoſe
loathſome creatures leaue their
owne element to puniſh them,
which rebelliouſly detained Iſraell
from their owne. No bed, no
table can be free from them, their
dainty Ladies cannot keep them
out of their boſomes; neither can
the Egyptians ſooner open their
mouthes, than they are ready to
creepe into their throats; as if
they would tell them that they
came on purpoſe to reuenge the

wrongs of their maker: yet euen
this wonder alſo is Satan allowed
to imitate. Who can maruell to
ſee the beſt vertues counterfeited
by wicked men, when hee ſees
the diuell emulating the miraculous
power of God? The feates
that Satan plaies may harden, but
cannot benefit. Hee that hath
leaue to bring frogs, hath neither
leaue, nor power, to take them
away, nor to take away the
ſtench from them. To bring
them, was but to adde to the
iudgement; to remooue them,
was an act of mercy. God doth
commonly vſe Satan in executing
of iudgement, neuer in the
workes of mercie to men.
                     Yet euen by thus much is Pharaoh
                        
hardned, and the ſorcerers
growen inſolent. When the diuell
and his agents are in the
height of their pride, GOD
ſhames them in a trifle. The rod
is lift vp: the very duſt receiues
life: lice abound euery where,
and make no difference betwixt
beggers and Princes. Though
Pharaoh and his Courtiers abhorred
to ſee themſelues louzie, yet
they hoped this miracle would
be more eaſily imitable: but now
the greater poſſibilitie, the greater
foile. How are the great wonder-mongers
of Egypt abaſhed
that they can neither make lice
of their owne, nor deliuer themſelues
from the lice that are
made. Thoſe that could make
ſerpents and frogs, could not either

make or kill lice; to ſhew
them that thoſe frogs and ſerpents
were not their owne workmanſhip.
Now Pharaoh muſt
needs ſee how impotent a diuell
hee ſerued, that could not make
that vermine which euery day riſes
voluntarily out of corruption.
Iannes and Iambres cannot now
make thoſe lice (ſo much as by
deluſion) which at another time
they cannot chuſe but produce
vnknowing, and which now
they cannot auoid. That ſpirit
which is powerfull to execute
the greateſt things when hee is
bidden, is vnable to doe the leaſt
when he is reſtrained. Now theſe
corriuals of Moſes can ſay, This is
the finger of God. Yee fooliſh Inchanters,
was Gods finger in the

lice, not in the frogs, not in the
blood, not in the ſerpent? And
why was it rather in the leſſe,
than in the greater? Becauſe yee
did imitate the other, not theſe.
As if the ſame finger of God had
not beene before in your imitation,
which was now in your reſtraint:
As if yee could haue failed
in theſe, if yee had not beene
only permitted the other. Whiles
wicked mindes haue their full
ſcope, they neuer looke vp aboue
themſelues; but when once God
croſſes them in their proceedings,
their want of ſucceſſe teaches
them to giue God his owne.
All theſe plagues perhaps had
more horror than paine in them.
The frogges creepe vpon their
clothes, the lice vpon their skins,

but thoſe ſtinging hornets which
ſucceed them, ſhall wound and
kill. The water was annoied
with the firſt plague, the earth
with the ſecond and third; this
fourth fils the aire, and beſides
corruption brings ſmart. And
that they may ſee this winged armie
comes out from an angrie
God, (not either from nature, or
chance) euen the very flies ſhall
make a difference betwixt Egypt,
and Goſhen. He that gaue them
their being, ſets them their ſtint.
They can no more ſting an Iſraelite,
than fauour an Egyptian.
The very wings of flies are directed
by a prouidence, and doe acknowledge
their limits. Now
Pharaoh findes how impoſſible it
is for him to ſtand out with God,

ſince all his power cannot reſcue
him from lice and flies.
                     And now his heart begins to
thaw a little: Goe, doe ſacrifice to
your God in this land; or (ſince
that will not be accepted) Go into
the wilderneſſe, but not far: but
how ſoone it knits againe! Good
thoughts make but a thorow-fare
of carnall hearts, they can
neuer ſettle there: yea his very
miſſe-giuing hardens him the
more: that now neither the murren
of his cattle, nor the botches
of his ſeruants can ſtirre him a
whit. Hee ſaw his cattle ſtrucke
dead with a ſudden contagion;
he ſaw his ſorcerers (after their
conteſtation with Gods meſſengers)
ſtrucke with a ſcabbe in

their very faces, and yet his heart
is not ſtrucke. Who would think
it poſſible that any ſoule could
bee ſecure in the midſt of ſuch varietie,
and frequence of iudgements?
Theſe very plagues haue
not more wonder in them, than
their ſucceſſe hath. To what an
height of obduration will ſinne
leade a man, and of all ſinnes, incredulity?
Amidſt all theſe ſtorms
Pharaoh ſleepeth, till the voice of
Gods mightie thunders, and haile
mixed with fire rouzed him vp a
little.
                     Now as betwixt ſleeping and
waking, hee ſtarts vp, and ſaies,
God is righteous, I am wicked, Moſes
pray for vs, and preſently laies
downe his head againe. God hath

no ſooner done thundring, than
hee hath done fearing. All this
while you neuer finde him carefull
to preuent any one euill, but
deſirous ſtill to ſhift it off when
he feeles it; neuer holds conſtant
to any good motion; neuer
praies for himſelfe, but careleſly
willes Moſes and Aaron to pray for
him; neuer yeelds God his whole
demand, but higgleth and dodgeth,
like ſome hard chapman,
that would get a releaſe with the
cheapeſt: Firſt, they ſhall not go;
then, goe and ſacrifice, but in Egypt;
next, goe ſacrifice in the
wilderneſſe, but not farre off;
after, goe ye that are men; then,
goe you and your children only;
at laſt, goe all ſaue your ſheepe
and cattle. Whereſoeuer meere

nature is, ſhe is ſtill improuident
of future good, ſenſible of preſent
euill, inconſtant in good
purpoſes, vnable, through vnacquaintance,
and vnwilling to
ſpeake for her ſelfe, niggardly in
her grants, and vncheerfull. The
plague of the graſhoppers ſtartled
him a little; and the more,
through the importunitie of his
ſeruants: for when he conſidered
the fiſh deſtroied with the firſt
blow, the cattle with the fifth,
the corne with the ſeuenth, the
fruit and leaues with this eighth,
and nothing now left him but a
bare fruitleſſe earth to liue vpon,
and that, couered ouer with locuſts,
neceſſitie droue him to relent
for an aduantage: Forgiue mee
this once; take from me this death only.
                        
But as conſtrained repentance
is euer ſhort and vnſound; the
Weſt winde together with the
graſhoppers blowes away his remorſe;
and now is hee ready for
another iudgement. As the graſhoppers
tooke away the ſight of
the earth from him, ſo now a
groſſe darkneſſe takes away the
ſight of heauen too: other darkneſſes
were but priuatiue, this
was reall and ſenſible. The Egyptians
thought this night long,
(how could they chuſe, when it
was ſix in one?) and ſo much the
more, for that no man could riſe
to talke with other, but was neceſſarily
confined to his owne
thoughts: One thinkes, the fault
in his owne eies, which hee rubs
often times in vaine: Others

thinke that the Sunne is loſt out
of the firmament, and is now
with-drawen for euer: Others,
that all things are returning to
their firſt confuſion: All thinke
themſelues miſerable paſt remedie,
and wiſh (whatſoeuer had
befallen them) that they might
haue had but light enough to ſee
themſelues die.
                     Now Pharaoh prooues like to
ſome beaſts that grow mad with
baiting: grace often reſiſted turns
to deſperateneſſe; Get thee from
mee, looke thou ſee my face no more;
whenſoeuer thou commeſt in my ſight,
thou ſhalt die. As if Moſes could
not plague him as well in abſence:
As if hee that could not
take away the lice, flies, frogges,

graſhoppers, could at his pleaſure
take away the life of Moſes
that procured them. What is
this but to run vpon the iudgements,
and runne away from the
remedies? Euermore, when Gods
meſſengers are abandoned, deſtruction
is neere. Moſes will ſee
him no more till he ſee him dead
vpon the ſands; but God will
now viſit him more than euer:
The fearefulleſt plagues God ſtill
reſerues for the vpſhot: All the
former doe but make way for the
laſt. Pharaoh may exclude Moſes
and Aaron, but Gods Angell hee
cannot exclude: Inſenſible meſſengers
are vſed, when the viſible
are debarred.
                     Now God beginnes to call for

the blood they owned him: In
one night euery houſe hath a
carcaſe in it and (which is more
grieuous) of their firſt borne,
and (which is yet more fearefull)
in an inſtant. No man could
comfort other; euery man was
too full of his owne ſorrow, helping
rather to make the noiſe of
the lamentation more dolefull,
and aſtoniſhing. How ſoone
hath God changed the note of
this tyrannicall people! Egypt
was neuer ſo ſtubborne in deniing
paſſage to Iſrael, as now importunate
to intreat it: Pharaoh
did not more force them to ſtay
before, than now to depart:
whom lately they would not permit,
now they hire to go. Their
rich iewels of ſiluer and gold

were not too deare for them
whom they hated; how much
rather had they to ſend them
away wealthy, than to haue
them ſtay to bee their executors?
Their loue to themſelues obtained
of them the inriching of
their enemies; and now they are
glad to pay them well for their
old worke, and their preſent
iourney: Gods people had ſtaid
like ſlaues, they goe away like
conquerours, with the ſpoile of
thoſe that hated them: armed
for ſecuritie, and wealthie for
maintenance.
                     Old Iacobs ſeuenty ſouls which
he brought downe into Egypt in
ſpight of their bondage &amp; bloodſhed,
goe foorth ſix hundred

thouſand men, beſides children.
The world is well mended with
Iſrael ſince he went with his ſtaffe
and ſcrippe ouer Iordan. Tyrannie
is too weake, where God bids
Increaſe and multiplie. I know
not where elſe the good hearbe
ouer-growes the weedes; the
Church out-ſtrips the world. I
feare if they had liued in eaſe and
delicacie, they had not beene ſo
ſtrong, ſo numerous. Neuer any
true Iſraelite loſt by his affliction.
Not only for the action, but the
time, Pharaohs choice meets with
Gods. That very night, when
the 130. yeeres were expired, Iſrael
is gone, Pharaoh neither can,
nor can will to keepe them longer;
yet in this, not fulfilling
Gods will, but his owne. How

ſweetly doth God diſpoſe of all
ſecond cauſes, that whiles they
doe their owne will, they do his?
                     The Iſraelites are equally glad
of this haſte: who would not be
ready to goe, yea to flie out of
bondage? They haue what
they wiſhed; it was no ſtaying
for a ſecond inuitation. The
loſſe of an opportunitie is many
times vnrecouerable: The loue
of their libertie made the burden
of their dough light: who knew
whether the variable minde of
Pharaoh might returne to a deniall,
and (after all his ſtubborneneſſe)
repent of his obedience?
It is fooliſh to hazard where there
is certaintie of good offers, and
vncertainetie of continuance.

They goe therfore; and the ſame
God that fetcht them out, is both
their guide and protector. How
carefully doth hee chuſe their
way? not the neerer, but the ſafer.
He would not haue his people ſo
ſuddenly change from bondage
to warre.
                     It is the wondrous mercy of
God that he hath reſpect, as to his
owne glory, ſo to our infirmities.
He intends them wars heereafter,
but after ſome longer breathing,
and more preparation; his goodnes
ſo orders all, that euils are not
ready for vs, till wee be ready for
them. And as hee chuſes, ſo hee
guides their way. That they
might not erre in that ſandy and
vntracked wilderneſſe, himſelfe

goes before them: who could but
follow cheerefully when hee ſees
God leade him? He that lead the
wiſe men by a ſtarre, leads Iſrael
by a cloud: That was an higher
obiect, therefore hee giues them
an higher and more heauenly
conduct: This was more earthly,
therefore he contents himſelfe
with a lower repreſentation of
his preſence. A piller of cloud
and fire: A piller, for firmneſſe;
of cloud and fire, for viſibilitie
and vſe. The greater light extinguiſhes
the leſſe, therefore in the
day he ſhewes them not fire, but
a cloud: In the night nothing is
ſeene without light; therefore
he ſhewes them not the cloud,
but fire: The cloud ſhelters them
from heat by day; the fire digeſts

the rawneſſe of the night. The
ſame God is both a cloud and a
fire to his children, euer putting
himſelfe into thoſe formes of gracious
reſpects, that may beſt fit
their neceſſities.
                     As good motions are long ere
they can enter into hard hearts,
ſo they ſeldome continue long.
No ſooner were the backes of Iſrael
turned to depart, than Pharaohs
heart and face is turned after
them, to fetch them backe againe.
It vexes him to ſee ſo great a command,
ſo much wealth caſt away
in one night; which now he reſolues
to redeeme, though with
more plagues. The ſame ambition
and couetouſneſſe that made
him weare out ſo many iudgements,

will not leaue him, till it
haue wrought out his full deſtruſtruction.
All Gods vengeances
haue their end, the finall perdition
of his enemies, which they
cannot reſt till they haue attained:
Pharaoh therefore and his Egyptians
will needs go fetch their
bane. They well knew that Iſrael
was fitter to ſerue than to fight;
weary with their ſeruitude, not
trained vp to warre, not furniſhed
with prouiſion for a field:
Themſelues captaines and ſouldiers
by profeſſion, furniſhed
with horſes, and chariots of war.
They gaue themſelues therefore
the victory beforehand, and Iſrael
either for ſpoile or bondage:
yea the weake Iſraelites gaue vp
themſelues for dead, and already

are talking of their graues. They
ſee the ſea before them; behinde
them, the Egyptians: they know
not whether is more mercileſſe,
and are ſtrucken with the feare of
both. O God, how couldeſt
thou forbeare ſo diſtruſtfull a
people! They had ſeene all thy
wonders in Egypt, and in their
Goſhen; they ſaw euen now thy
piller before them, and yet they
did more feare Egypt than beleeue
thee. Thy patience is no
leſſe miracle than thy deliuerance.
But in ſtead of remoouing
from them, the cloudy piller
remooues behinde them, and
ſtands betwixt the Iſraelites and
Egyptians: as if God would haue
ſaid, They ſhall firſt ouercome
mee, O Iſrael, ere they touch

thee. Wonder did now iuſtly
ſtriue with feare in the Iſraelites,
when they ſaw the cloud remooue
behinde them, and the
ſea remooue before them. They
were not vſed to ſuch bulwarkes.
God ſtood behinde them in the
cloud; the ſea reared them vp
walles on both ſides them. That
which they feared would be their
deſtruction, protected them:
how eaſily can God make the
cruelleſt of his creatures both our
friends and patrons?
                     Yet heere was faith mixed with
vnbeleefe. Hee was a bold Iſraelite
that ſet the firſt foot into the
channell of the ſea: and euery
ſteppe that they ſet in that moiſt
way, was a new exerciſe of their

faith. Pharaoh ſees all this, and
wonders; yet hath not the wit
or grace to thinke (though the
piller tels him ſo much) that God
made a difference betwixt him,
and Iſrael. Hee is offended with
the ſea, for giuing way to his enemies,
and yet ſees not why hee
may not truſt it as well as they.
Hee might well haue thought
that hee which gaue light in Goſhen,
when there was darkneſſe
in Egypt, could as well diſtinguiſh
in the ſea: but hee cannot
now either conſider, or feare: It
is his time to periſh. God makes
him faire way, and lets him run
ſmoothly on till hee be come to
the midſt of the ſea; not one
waue may riſe vp againſt him to
wet ſo much as the hoofe of his

horſe. Extraordinary fauours to
wicked men are the fore-runners
of their ruine.
                     Now when God ſees the Egyptians
too farre to returne, he
findes time to ſtrike them with
their laſt terrour: they know not
why, but they would returne
too late. Thoſe Chariots in
which they truſted, now faile
them, as hauing done ſeruice enough
to carry them into perdition.
God purſues them, and
they cannot flie from him. Wicked
men make equall haſte both
to ſinne, and from iudgement:
but they ſhall one day finde that
it is not more eaſie to runne into
ſinne, than impoſſible to runne
away from iudgement: the ſea

will ſhew them, that it regards
the rod of Moſes, not the ſcepter
of Pharaoh; and now (as gladde
to haue got the enemies of God
at ſuch an aduantage) ſhuts her
mouth vpon them, and ſwallowes
them vp in her waues, and
after ſhee hath made ſport with
them a while, caſts them vp on
her ſands, for a ſpectacle of triumph
to their aduerſaries.
                     What a ſight was this to the
Iſraelites, when they were now
ſafe on the ſhore to ſee their enemies
come floating after them
vpon the billowes, and to finde
among the carcaſes vpon the
ſands, their knowen oppreſſors,
which now they can tread vpon
with inſultation. They did not

crie more loud before, than now
they ſing. Not their faith, but
their ſenſe teaches them now to
magnifie that God after their
deliuerance, whom they
hardly truſted for deliuerance.
                  
                  FINIS.
