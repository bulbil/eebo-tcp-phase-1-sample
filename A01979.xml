            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               Right Honourable, Right Worſhipfull;
            
            
               YOur Honour and Worſhips being (by the good guiding prouidence of GOD) the Generall, Captaines, and Liefetenants of this Metropolis, this chiefe City &amp; Caſtle of the Kingdome, wherein (by the ſame Prouidence) I am (thogh one of the meaneſt, yet) one of the Watchmen; To whom ought I rather to preſent theſe fruits of my Watchmans function, then vnto your Honour and Worſhips? As duty in regard of your places, ſo gratefulneſſe alſo in regard of your kindneſſes, requires as much. My Father, Grandfather, and other Predeceſſors, haue of old from time to time beene beholding to this Honourable City: the kindneſſe which they formerly receiued, is ſtill continued to mee. Which as I doe with all humble thankfulneſſe acknowledge, ſo from my heart I deſire the Almighty to remember your Honor and Worſhips, together with the whole eſtate of this Honourable City, in goodneſſe, and not to wipe out the kindneſſe which is ſhewed to the Miniſters of his Word, and to poore diſtreſſed people. Long hath the Goſpell beene purely, powerfully, plentifully preached in this honourable City, and great countenance and maintenance hath by many therein beene giuen thereunto. Good orders haue within theſe later yeeres beene taken for the better ſanctifying of the Lords Sabbath. Much reliefe is from time to time giuen to the poore. Theſe and ſuch like workes of Piety and Charity, are the beauty, honour, ſtrength, and wealth of this City. I denie not, but that in the outward politicke gouernment of this great Corporation, and the many ſeuerall Companies therein, London may be accounted the glorie of the earth. But the things which make it exceed in glory, are, the faire houſes of Prayer and preaching the Word; the great Aſſemblies of Gods people frequenting the ſame to worſhip God: the ſpacious Hoſpitals and places of Charity, together with the liberall prouiſion therein made for reliefe of poore children and orphants, of aged and impotent men and women, of lame and maimed ſouldiers, and of many other like ſuccourleſſe perſons; the thrones of Iuſtice and Iudgement, with the like, wherein London may be compared to Sion the City of God, whereof great and excellent things are ſpoken.
Right Honourable and Right Worſhipfull, goe on this way, (which is the onely right way) to procure the peace and proſperity of your City. Let the Miniſtry of Gods Word be more and more promoted: Let the Lords Sabbaths haue their due obſeruations, let the poore be releeued, and the oppreſſed be ſuccoured; let profane perſons and all euill doers (the enemies of Chriſtian Policies) be puniſhed: In a word, let Gods Ordinances be aduanced, and right iudgement executed, and ſo ſhall London be accounted the City of the great King, where he will delight to dwell, and beſtow his bleſſing. For in theſe things is God highly honoured: Now God who can and will performe it,1 Sam. 2. 30. hath ſaid it; Them that honour me, will I honour. It lieth much in the power of Magiſtrates to procure or hinder the bleſſing of God in thoſe Cities &amp; places ouer which they are ſet. For they being publike perſons, their good deeds are by the wiſe God publikely rewarded, and their euill deedes publikely reuenged. Right Honourable and Right Worſhipfull, accept, I pray you, the duty, and pardon the boldnes of your Watchman. And, O Lord of Lords, doe good to this City of thine, continue the peace and proſperity thereof: ſo prayeth

            TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, RJGHT WORSHIPFVLL, AND OTHER my beloued Pariſhioners, Inhabitants of the precinct of Blacke-fryers London, Grace in Chriſt.
            
               Right Honourable, Right Worſhipfull, Beloued;
            
            
               AMong the many great bleſsings which the Lord hath beene pleaſed to beſtow on me, his poore ſeruant, vnworthy of the leaſt, I account this to be an high Fauour, that he hath put me in his Seruice, and appointed me to be one of the Miniſters of his Word. Baſely is this calling accounted of by the greater, and vulgar ſort of people: but my conſcience beareth me witneſſe that I receiue ſuch contentment therein, and hold my ſelfe ſo honoured thereby, as I preferre it to all other callings, and am prouoked thereby to giue ſome euidence of my thankefull acceptance thereof: which better I know not how to doe, then by imploying and improuing to my poore power, the Talent which my Maſter hath committed to my charge. I am not ignorant how inſufficient I am thereunto,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . and that not onely in regard of the greatneſſe of the worke (whereunto who is ſufficient?) but alſo in compariſon of other Miniſters,
               2 Cor. 2. 16. whom God in great number hath raiſed vp in theſe our dayes. Yet withall I know that the great Maſter accepted the imployment of two talents as well as of fine:
               Mat. 25. 23. yea, if he that receiued but one talent, had imployed it, euen he alſo ſhould haue beene accepted: for God, the
               righteous Iudge,
               2 Tim. 4. 8. neither exacteth, nor expecteth more then he giueth. If there be a willing mind, it is accepted according to that which a man hath,
               2 Cor. 8. 12. 
               and not according to that which he hath not. This is it which moueth me, as by Preaching, ſo alſo by publiſhing ſome part of my labours in Print, to ſeeke the edification of Gods Church. I account Preaching the moſt principall part of my function: for this is Chriſts charge,Mar. 16. 15. 
               Goe preach the Goſpell; and this is that Ordinance wherein and whereby God doth ordinarily, and moſt eſpecially manifest his owne power, and beſtow his bleſſing. This is it therefore which hitherto I haue moſt attended vpon, and intend ſo to continue as long as God ſhall affoord mee ability and liberty. Yet I doubt not but Gods people doe alſo receiue much benefit by ſundry Treatiſes in diuers kinds publiſhed in print. For as Preaching is of power eſpeciallie to worke vpon the affections, ſo Printing may be one eſpeciall meanes to informe the iudgement.Vox audita perit, littera ſcripta manet. For that which is Printed lieth by a man, and may againe and againe be read, and throughly pondered, till a man come to conceiue the very depth of that he readeth. Beſides, herein is a great benefit of printing, that the gifts and paines of Gods ſeruants are made much more common then otherwiſe they could be: hereby wee partake of the labours of thoſe who haue liued in former times, or in other Countries, and whom we could neuer haue heard ſpeake. Now a good thing,Bonum quo communius eo melius. the more common it is, the better it is. It cannot be denied but that knowledge and learning haue wonderfully encreaſed by the benefit of Printing. Whereas there is a cōmon complaint againſt multitude of Books, it is for the moſt part againſt idle &amp; euill Bookes, or elſe an vniuſt cōplaint. If it be ſaid, that there can nothing be written, but what hath beene written before, I anſwer, that though it ſhould be true in regard of the ſumme and ſubſtance of matters, yet in regard of a more full opening, a more perſpicuous deliuering, a more euident prouing, a more powerfull vrging and preſsing of points,Aliquid novus ad
                     •
                  cit Author. a more fit applying of them to preſent occaſions more and more may be, and daily is added by ſundry Authors, whereby the Church of God is much edified. But may not the ſame argument be alleadged againſt Preaching? and doe not many alleadge it? Howſoeuer ſome, too enuiouſly minded, cenſure the meanes which God in mercy hath affoorded for the building vp of the body of Chriſt Ieſus, my deſire is euery way to doe what good I can; and therefore I haue beene bold to commit to your eies and reading, ſome part of that which I haue heretofore commended to your eares and hearing. I doe now make a triall of my paines in this kind: if I ſhall obſerue that Gods Church reapeath any benefit thereby, I ſhall be encouraged to take the more paines hereafter, as I ſhall find any leaſure. I am the ſeruant of Chriſt, and of his Church; ſo long as my life, health, ſtrength, liberty, or any ability is by the good prouidence of God preſerued vnto me, my deſire is to ſpend it in the ſeruice of Chriſt, and of his Church. Among others I eſpecially entreat you (my beloued Pariſhioners and Auditors, of what rancke or degree ſoeuer ye be) in the beſt part to interpret, and with the beſt mind to accept theſe my endeauours; whereby, though I haue aimed at a more generall good, then I could by preaching (hoping that many whom I neuer knew, nor ſaw, may reape ſome benefit by my paines) yet eſpecially I intend your good, whoſe proper and peculiar Miniſter I am, and for whoſe ſoules I watch, as hee that muſt giue an account. In this triall which I make of publiſhing ſome of my meditations, I beginne with the laſt part of my labors, becauſe they are freſheſt in your memories that heard them preached, and containe points more largely diſcuſſed, and, as I take it, of greater vſe then any other, which throughout the courſe of my Miniſtry I haue handled. For the time of our life being a time of warre, a time wherein our ſpirituall enemies (who are many, mighty, malitious, ſedulous, and ſubtile) put forth their ſtrength, and beſtir themſelues to the vttermoſt that poſsibly they can,1 Pet. 5. 8. 
               Seeking whom to deuoure, what can bee more behoueful, then to diſcouer their cunning ſtratagems and wyles, to declare wherein their ſtrength lieth, to furniſh Chriſts Souldiers with compleat armour and ſufficient defence, and to ſhew how our enemies may bee diſappointed of their hopes, and we ſtand faſt againſt all their aſſaults? This is the ſcope of this Treatiſe. The Analyſis and Tables which I haue cauſed to be ſet before and after the Booke, doe point out the ſeuerall and diſtinct points contained therein, ſo as I neede not here make any repetition of them. I haue laboured to bee as perſpicuous and briefe as I could, in handling ſo weighty matters. I haue in many places deliuered no more then the heads of ſuch points as I largely handled in deliuering them out of the Pulpit: which any may well coniecture to be ſo, that ſhall know that the ſubſtance of almoſt an hundred ſeuerall Sermons is contained in this Treatiſe. My deſire of breuity moued me to referre the quotation of moſt places of Scripture vnto the margent, and to leaue the Text to be ſearched out by the Reader, which I wiſh thee to doe as thy leaſure will permit thee. To conclude, I commend this Treatiſe to your diligent reading, and fauourable acceptance, my ſelfe to your Chriſtian prayers, and all of vs to the good grace of God,Church-court in Black-friers London, December 31. 1618. and reſt

            AN ADVERTISEMENT to the Reader.
            
               CHRISTIAN READER,
            
            
               
                  THE good entertainment which this Treatiſe of The whole Armour of God, hath found among Gods people, emboldeneth me againe to publiſh the ſame. The ſame it is for ſubſtance which thou haddeſt before: for I find no iuſt cauſe to alter any part of the ſubſtance thereof. Onely here and there ſomething hath beene added, to make ſuch points as ſeemed too conciſe and obſcure, more perſpicuous.
            Some there were, that finding the head of Faſting in the Table, looked for a diſtinct and larger diſcourſe of that point, which when they found not (for I did but briefly by the way touch it, as an helpe to Prayer) they entreated mee to take a little more paines thereabout. To their good motion I haue yeelded, and according to my poore abilitie, and little leaſure, I haue more copiouſly handled that very-needfull, but too-much-neglected dutie of Fasting.
            
            I was further informed that the point of not praying for them that ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, would much trouble the conſciences of ſome, if they were not informed in the nature of that ſin; and thereupon I haue beene mooued to annex a Treatiſe concerning that ſinne: in handling whereof, leſt Sa
                  •
               tan ſhould take aduantage vpon weake conſciences, from the fearefull iſſue thereof, to exclude themſelues or others (who haue not fallen into that ſinne) from all hope of pardon. I haue (treading in the ſteps, and following the path wherein Ieſus Chriſt hath gone before mee) with the ſeuerity of Gods Iuſtice in affording no pardon to that ſinne, mixed the riches of his Mercy, in offering pardon to all other ſinnes: ſo as this Treatiſe affordeth more matter of hope and comfort, then of feare and deſpaire.
            In this Edition there are for thy helpe more diſtinctions of ſeuerall points then were before. For that which before was ſet forth as one Treatiſe, is now diuided into three ſeuerall Treatiſes, and the Treatiſe of the Sinne against the Holy Ghost, added thereto, maketh a fourth.
            Theſe ſeuerall Treatiſes are alſo diuided into their diſtinct
Parts: and againe ſubdiuided into ſundry Sections: ouer euery of which the ſumme and head of the matter therein handled, is ſet. Thus both great light is giuen for better vnderſtanding, and alſo a ready way is made for finding out the ſeuerall points contained in this Booke.
            A Table of all theſe Diuiſions, aud of the diſtinct heads of euery of them is ſet before the Booke, that if it pleaſe thee, thou mayeſt at once take a briefe view of all.
            That which I eſpecially haue aymed at for thee, is thy ſpirituall edification. That which I earneſtly deſire of thee, is the helpe of thy faithfull prayers.Churchcourt in Blackfriers London, December 31. 1618. Pray for me

my Brethren.

                        The neceſſary of this Direction. 
                        as if with more copie of words he had thus ſaid; Though I haue ſufficiently inſtructed you in doctrines of faith, and precepts of manners, yet there is one needfull point behinde, which being deliuered, I may conclude all: there is yet (I ſay) a remainder, and the only remainder of all, by which yee may make good vſe of all that hath beene hitherto deliuered, without which, all will bee in vaine.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                          Is this Direction ſo needful a point? a point which may not be omitted?
 a point worthy of the laſt place, as moſt of all to be remembred? thenHebr. 21. ought we to giue the more earnest heed thereunto, leſt at any time we ſhould let it ſlip. In hearing we muſt well heede it: after we haue heard it, wee muſt well keepe it, and

                     §. 3. The Apostles affection.
                     TO vrge this point yet ſomewhat the more forcibly, the Apoſtle in the next place manifeſteth his affection in theſe words, My brethren, which declare both the humilitie of his minde, and the gentleneſſe of his ſpirit.
                     
                        Brother is a word of equalitie:Obſer. 2. in calling them Brethren, he maketh himſelfe equall vnto them,The Apoſtles humilitie. though he himſelfe were one of the principall members of Chriſts body, one of the eyes thereof, a Miniſter of the Word, an extraordinarie Miniſter, an Apoſtle, a ſpirituall Father of many ſoules, a planter of many famous Churches, yea the planter of this Church at Epheſus: and though many of them to whom he wrote, were poore meane men, handicrafts men, ſuch asChap 4. v. 28 laboured with their hands for their liuing: and many alſoVerſ. 5. 8. ſeruants, and bond-men; yet without exception of any, he termeth and counteth them all his
brethren, and ſoRom. 12. 16. maketh himſelf euall to them of the lower ſort. Behold his humilitie: For if to affect titles of ſuperioritie, as Rabbi, Doctor, Father, bee a note of arrogancie (as it is,Mat. 23. 7, &amp;c. and therefore Chriſt in that reſpect taxeth the Scribes and Phariſes) then to take and giue titles of equallitie, is a note of humilitie. The like notes of humilitie may be oft noted both in other Epiſtles of this Apoſtle, and in the Epiſtles of other Apoſtles; yea and in all the Prophets alſo.
                     Well they knew,Reaſon. that notwithſtanding there were diuers offices, places, and outward degrees, among Chriſtians: yet theyMal. 2. 10. Epheſ. 4. 6. 
                        all had one Father, and were fellow members of1 Cor. 12. 12. 
                        One and the ſame bodie, and in regard of their ſpirituall eſtateGal. 3. 28. 
                        all one in Chriſt Ieſus.
                     
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                          Take my Brethren the Prophets,
 take the Apoſtles, yea take Chriſt himſelfe for an example of humilitie.Account all Brethren. For Chriſt, though he were Lord of all, yet for as much asHeb. 2. 11, 14. 
                        he tooke part with vs, and ſo all were of one, hee was not aſhamed to call vs Brethren. Who then can diſdaine to call any Saint Brother? This point of humilitie and meekeneſſe Chriſt willeth vs after an eſpeciall manner toMatth. 11. 29▪
                         learne of him. It is a grace which will highly grace vs before God and man. It maketh vs amiable in Gods eyes, whoProu. 3. 34. 
                        Giueth grace to the lowly: and it maketh our company very acceptable to men. An humble minded man who maketh himſelfe equall to them of the lower ſort, &amp; accounteth all his brethren, will be ſociable and willing to conuerſe with any for their mutual good. But proud and ambitious ſpirits are full of ſcorne and diſdaine, ſo as men cannot well endure their company, and1 Pet. 5. 5. 
                        God will reſiſt them. Wherefore, to conclude this point, whatſoeuer your parts of nature, or gifts of Gods Spirit be, whatſoeuer your place or calling bee, whatſoeuer excellencie or eminencie you haue aboue others, remember that all Saints haue one Father, all are of one body, all are one in Chriſt, therefore all account one another Brethren. Let Magi ſtrates, Miniſters, and all of all ſorts apply this.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2  As for ſuch prophane perſons,
 who deride the Saints for giuing this title Brethren one to another,This title brother, not to be 
                              •
                           corned. doe they not thorow thoſe Saints ſides ſtrike the Prophets, the Apoſtles, yea and Chriſt himſelfe?
                     Note further the gentle and milde ſpirit of the Apoſtle;
Brethren,
                        
                           Obſer. 3. The Apoſtles mildneſſe. is a title of kindneſſe and loue: My, an attribute which addeth emphaſis thereunto. In other places he vſeth other attributes, which adde greater emphaſis, as1 Cor. 15. 58. 
                        My beloued brethren,
                        Phil. 4. 1. 
                        My brethren beloued and longed for. So like wiſe other phraſes which imply as great meekeneſſe and gentleneſſe, asGal. 4. 19. 
                        My little children,
                        1 Cor. 4. 1
                              •
                           . 
                        My beloued children, &amp;c.
                     It was not want of authority to command that made him thus gently exhort, but rather an earneſt deſire that he had to perſwade, and euen prouoke them to doe that which was their bounden duty and tended to their good. Marke how he dealeth with Philemon, verſ 9, 10, 20, by this meekeneſſe he inſinuateth himſelfe into them, and ſheweth that hee ſeeketh not himſelfe, and his owne good, ſo much as them and their good.
                     
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                          Learne Miniſters,
 Maſters, Parents, and all Chriſtians how to enforce your exhortations and perſwaſions:Inforce exhor tations with euidence of loue. euen with euidences of loue, with all mildneſſe and gentlenes. (2 Tim. 2. 24. 
                        The ſeruants of the Lord must not ſtriue, but bee gentle toward all men.) Thus ſhall you giue them a pleaſant ſauour and ſweete relliſh, yea though the things whereunto yee exhort be vnpleaſing to mens naturall taſte, and carnall appetite.Simil. When ful ſome potions or bitter pills are ſweetned with ſugar, they will the ſooner be ſwallowed, and better digeſted: ſo exhottations ſeaſoned with termes of mildneſſe and gentleneſſe.
                     Thus much for the manner of the Apoſtles direction.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 4. The need of Chriſtian courage.
                     THe matter followeth, the firſt part whereof is in theſe words, Bee ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might: wherenote, firſt, what is required, ſecondly, how that which is required may be performed.
                     The thing required is to be ſtrong, the Apoſtle heere ſpeaketh of an inward ſpirituall ſtrength, the ſtrength of the inward and new man, and his meaning is that wee ſhould bee valorous and couragious in the performance of thoſe Chriſtian duties which we take in hand.
                     
                        Chriſtian valour and ſpirituall courage is a needfull grace.
                        Doct. 1. Note with what varietie of phraſe the Apoſtle doth exhort hereunto,Spirituall valour needfull. 1. Cor. 16. 13. Stand faſt, quit you like men, be ſtrong: hereuntoIoſ. 1. 6. 7. God perſwadeth his ſeruant Ioſhuah, and1 Chr. 18. 10. 
                        Dauid, his ſonne Salomon.
                        1 Sam. 17. 45 
                        Dauid had in him this holy valour and courage, when hee went againſt Goliah,
                         andActs 21. 13. 
                        Paul when he was going to Ieruſalem. But moſt valorous and ſtrong did Chriſt our Captaine ſhew himſelf, when he was going vp to Ieruſalem to ſuffer,Luke 9. 51. The Euangeliſt ſaith, he ſtedfaſtly ſet his face, he ſetled himſelfe fully to go: though it were to drink a moſt bitter cup, he would not be drawne from it. Becauſe Peter labored to diſſwade him,Mat. 16. 23. he ſharpely rebuked him, and called him Satan.
                     
                     The reaſons why this ſpirituall valour is ſo needfull, are ſpecially two.
                     Firſt,Reaſon 1. becauſe of our owne indiſpoſition, timerouſnes, dulneſſe, and back wardneſſe to all holy and good duties. What Chriſtian findeth not this by woefull experience in himſelfe? when he would pray, heare Gods word, partake of the Sacraments, ſanctifie the Sabbath, or performe any other like Chriſtian dutie, there is I know not what fearefulneſſe in him, his fleſh hangeth backe, as a Beare when he is drawne to the ſtake.Rom. 7. 18. 
                              〈◊〉
                            &amp;c. This the holy Apoſtle found in himſelfe: ſo that for the rowſing vp of our own dulneſſe we haue need of valour.
                     Secondly,Reaſon 2. becauſe of thoſe many oppoſitions which we are like to meet withal. We heard before how the fleſh would hang back, and ſo labour to hinder vs. The world wil like wiſe do what it can, either by vaine inticements to ſeduce vs (as it drew away Demas,) or elſe by reproach, trouble, and perſecution, to terrifie vs, (as thoſe who forſooke
Paul) But aboue all the Diuell will be readie to reſiſt vs, (asZach. 3. 1. hee reſiſted Iehoſhuah) and to hinder vs (1 Theſ. 2. 18. as hee hindred Paul) yea to buffet vs (as2. Cor. 12. 7. hee buffeted the ſame Paul.) To omit other inſtances, moſt liuely is this ſet foorth in our Head and Generall Chriſt Ieſus. So ſoone as hee was ſet apart to his publike Miniſterie,Matth. 4. 1. 
                        the Tempter came to him: after he began to execute it, Satan ſtirred vp the Rulers, Prieſts, Scribes, Phariſes, and many other to hinder him; yea he moouedMat. 16. 22. 
                        Peter to diſſwade him, and when Chriſt was about to offer vp himſelfe a ſacrifice, then againJohn 14. 30. 
                        came the Prince of this world to diſcourage him. The like oppoſitions are all Chriſts members to looke for; ſo as there is no hope, no poſſibilitie of holding out and enduring to the end without this Chriſtian valour and magnanimitie heere ſpoken of.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 Iuſtly may they be taxed,
 who either too timerouſly, or too ſecurely and careieſly enter into a Chriſtian courſe,Timerouſnes taxed. and vndertake ſuch Chriſtian duties as are required at their hands. Hence it commeth to paſſe that many duties are cleane omitted of them, other intermitted and broken off before they are halfe done: and as for thoſe which are done, ſo vntowardly are they done, that little or no comfort can be found in doing of them. Lamentable experience ſheweth how ſmall matters doe diſcourage many who know the right way, and are oft in conſcience moued to walke therein.
                     Such as want this Chriſtian courage, were better not giue vp their names to bee Chriſts Souldiers, or profeſſe that they intend to fight the Lords battailes: for by their timerouſneſſe and cowardlineſſe they diſcourage other Souldiers of the Lord, and hearten the enemie. The Lord would not ſuffer any that wereDeut 21. 8. Judges 7. 3. 
                        fearefull and faint hearted to fight his battailes on earth againſt earthly enemies, leſt they made others faint like themſelues. Can wee thinke that he will entertaine faint hearted ſouldiers in his ſpirituall battailes againſt ſpirituall enemies, in which combates his owne honor, and his childrens ſaluation are ſo deepely ingaged?
                     As for the Enemie he is like a Wolfe, if ſtrongly he be reſiſted,Iames 4. 7. 
                        he will flie; if timerouſly he be yeelded vnto, he will more eagerly purſue and inſult.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 
                         Indeauour we therefore to get vnto our ſelues an holy courage and ſpirituall valour,
 ſhaking off our naturall fearefulneſſe,Phil. 1. 28. 
                        that in nothing we feare our aduerſaries, but (as Chriſt our General did)Heb. 12. 2. endure the croſſe, and deſpiſe the ſhame.) We that will be Chriſts ſouldiers muſt duely conſider the aduice which our Lord giueth, Luke 14 13. which is, to obſerue what kinde of enemies, how many, how mightie, we are to encounter withall. We ſhalOn verſe 12. hereafter heare how hard a battaile we are to vndertake, how many, mightie, malicious, ſubtill our enemies be: if notwithſtanding al this we be minded to fight vnder Chriſts banner, then be we ſtrong and couragious, bold asProu. 30. 30. Lions; ſo are theProu. 28. 1. righteous.
                  
                  
                     §. 5. All ſtrength from God.
                     BVt alaſſe,Obiect. what are we weake fleſh and bloud? What ſtrength can there bee in vs to fight againſt ſuch enemies as will ſet on vs?
                     For remouing this ſcruple,Anſwere. the Apoſtle addeth this clauſe, in the Lord, &amp;c. whereby he ſheweth how we come to be ſtrong, not by any ſtrength in our ſelues, but by ſeeking ſtrength in the Lord, caſting our ſelues wholly and onely on him, and on his power.
                     The ſtrength and valour whereby wee are enabled to fight the Lords battaile,
                           Doct. 2. Our ſtrength is in the Lord. is hid in the Lord, and to be had from him.
For
                        2 Cor. 3. 5. all our ſufficiencie is of God,Iohn. 15. 5. 
                        without Chriſt we can doe nothing. Hence is it that Dauid ſaith vnto God,
                        Pſal. 18. 1, 2. I loue thee dearely, O Lord my ſtrength: The Lord is my rock and fortreſſe, &amp;c.
                     
                     It is more euident then needs be proued, that this our Apoſtle was a ſtrong and valiant champion of the Lord; but whence had he this ſtrength?Phil. 4. 13. 
                        I am able (ſaith he) to doe all things through the helpe of Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth mee. That which in particular he ſaith of himſelfe, he alſo affirmeth of other Saints, whoCol. 1. 11. 
                        were ſtrengthned with all might through Gods glorious power.
                     
                     The Lord hath thus reſerued all ſtrength in himſelfe,Reaſons. and would haue vs ſtrong in him: partly for his owne glorie, and partly for our comfort.
                     
                     
                         For his glory, that in time of need we might flye vnto
 him,2. Cor. 12. 9. and in all ſtreights caſt our ſelues on him: and being preſerued and deliuered, acknowledge him our Sauiour, and accordingly giue him the whole praiſe.
                     
                         For our comfort, that in all diſtreſſes wee might bee
 the more confident. Much more bold may wee bee in the Lord, then in our ſelues. Gods power being infinite, it is impoſſible that it ſhould bee mated by any aduerſe power, which at the greateſt is finite: were our ſtrength in our ſelues, though for a time it might ſeeme ſomewhat ſufficient, yet would there be feare of decay: but being in God, we reſt vpon an omnipotencie, and ſo haue a farre ſurer proppe vnto our faith, as we ſhall heare in the next Doctrine.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 Learne wee to renounce all confidence in our ſelues,
 and to acknowledge our owne inabilitie and weakneſſe.Renounce all confidence in the ſelfe. Thus ſhall wee bee brought to ſeeke for helpe out of our ſelues. They who ouer weene themſelues, and conceit that they are ſufficiently able to helpe themſelues, will bee ſo farre from ſeeking ſtrength, that they will foully ſcorne it, when it is offered vnto them Marke what is ſaid of the wicked man, who is proud in his owne conceit,Pſal. 10. 3.

                        he that is full deſpiſeth an hony combe, ſo he that is confident in his owne ſtrength, deſpiſeth help from any other.

 and thereupon renounced all confidence in our ſelues,Reſt on a ſure ground. our care muſt be to flye to a ſure ground, and reſt thereon: ſo ſhall we be ſafe and ſure, yea ſo may wee bee quiet and ſecure. This ſure ground, and ſafe rocke is onely the Lord: ſtrong he is in himſelfe, and can both ſtrengthen vs, and weaken our enemies. In this confidence did1 Sam. 17. 45

                     §. 6. Gods power moſt mightie.
                     THat wee may bee the rather mooued to renounce all vaine confidence in our ſelues or other creatures, and be bold, valiant, and ſtrong in the Lord, caſting our whole confidence in him alone, the Apoſtle addeth theſe next words (in the power of his might) which are a very forceable amplificatiō of this former point. Some diſtinguiſh theſe two words, power and might, as the cauſe and effect, attributing
might to God, and power to the Saints, &amp; ſo make
Gods might the cauſe of their power, as if hee had ſaid, bee ſtrong in that power which yee receiue from the might of God. But I take this diſtinction heere to bee, Firſt too curious, and without good ground. Secondly, impertinent, becauſe that which the Apoſtle aimeth at, is to raiſe vp our faith to God, and to ſettle it firme in him, and therefore he ſetteth foorth the power of God, as it is in God himſelfe. Thirdly, not agreeable to the phraſe, which is the ſame in this clauſe as in the former, in the Lord, &amp; in the power, &amp;c. which implieth that the power heere ſpoken of, is a power in the Lord, and that as the Lord himſelfe is without vs, and aboue vs, ſo is this power. The phraſe therfore which the Apoſtle heere vſeth, I take to be an Hebraiſme, which ſome for perſpicuitie ſake tranſlate thus, in his mightie power, and not vnfitly. This very phraſe is vſedChap. 1. verſ. 19. before, and by moſt tranſlated his mightie power: this Hebraiſme
power of might, addeth great emphaſis, and implieth, that
might by an excellencie and propriety belongeth to Gods power onely; and that all other power in compariſon of it, is meere weakneſſe.
                     The point hence to be noted is this, that
                     
                        The power of God whereunto wee are to truſt,
                        
                           Doct. 3. Gods power is a moſt mightie power. 
                        is a moſt mighty and ſtrong power, a power able to protect vs againſt the might of al aduerſe power whatſoeuer. In this reſpect the Apoſtle calleth Gods power,
                           
                              •

                        an exceeding greatneſſe of power. Hee ſearcheth after rare and high phraſes to ſet foorth this power of God,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . becauſe of the infinite greatneſſe thereof, which cannot by ordinary and vſuall phraſes be expreſſed.
                     According to Gods greatneſſe is his power,Reaſon. infinite, incomprehenſible, inutterable, vnconceiueable: as a mighty winde which driueth all before it: as a ſwift and ſtrong ſtreame againſt which none can ſwimme: as a burning flaming fire which conſumeth and deuoureth all; ſo is Gods power. Whatſoeuer ſtandeth before it, and is oppoſed againſt it, is but as chaffe before a ſtrong winde, or bulruſhes before a ſwift current, or ſtubble before a flaming fire; for all aduerſe power, though to our weakneſſe it ſeeme neuer ſo mightie, yet can it be but finite, being the power of creatures, and ſo a limited power, yea, a dependant power, ſubordinate to this power of might, of his might, who is Almightie, and ſo no proportion betwixt them.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 A ſtrong prop is this vnto our faith,
Gods mighty power a prop to faith. and a good motiue to make vs1 Pet. 1. 13. 
                        perfectly truſt vnto the power of God without wauering or doubting, notwithſtanding our owne weaknes, or our aduerſaries power: though2 Chr. 20. 12. 
                        there bee no ſtrength in vs, yet is there power in God: though wee bee on euery ſide enuironed with ſtrong and fierce enemies, our fleſh and the violent luſts thereof, as headſtrong rebels and traytors within vs; the furious world, with the potent and raging perſecutors thereof, on one ſide; that fierce Lion and cruell Dragon the Diuell, with all his helliſh hoaſt, on the otherſide; yea all theſe banding their forces together continually in armes againſt vs, yet is there in God a power of might, in compariſon whereof all the power of all our aduerſaries is but weakneſſe. When we know not what to doe, then may wee, then muſt wee with faithfull Iehoſaphat turne our eyes to God,2 Chron. 20. 12. and to the power of his might. When we ſee potent enemies againſt vs, and no outward meanes to defend vs againſt them, we are ready to crie,2. King 6. 15. 
                        Alas how ſhall we do? and with thePſal. 78. 19, 20. Iſraelites to doubt of the power of God, and ſay, Can God helpe in ſuch ſtraits? can hee ſupport ſuch weaklings as we are? can he ſubdue ſuch and ſuch enemies as aſſault vs? Againſt ſuch doubts we are to meditate of this mightie power of God. Gods power being a power of might, he needeth nothing to helpe him. The weaker we are, the more is his power manifeſted: for it is2 Cor. 12. 9. 
                        made perfect in weakeneſſe: neither can Gods power be weakned or hindred by any aduerſe power.1 Sam. 14. 6. Many and mighty enemies are to him a few and weake ones:2 Chr. 34. 11. ſo that the more mightie his enemies be,Iudges 7. 2, &amp;c. the more honor redoundeth to him in ſubduing them. Wherefore for ſtrengthning our faith, that we may be ſtrong in the Lord, pray wee that2 King 6. 17. 
                        God would open our eyes, that we mayChap. 1. v. 19. ſee what is the exceeding greatnes of his power to vs-ward who beleeue: ſo ſhal we neither feare becauſe of our enemies power, nor faint becauſe of our owne weakneſſe, butExod. 14. 13. 
                        ſtand ſtill and behold the ſaluation of God.
                     
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 It is no matter of preſumption to be ſure of victory,
 being
                        ſtrong in this mightie power.
                        It is no preſumption to be confident in Gods mightie power. Indeed, if the ground of our aſſurance reſted in, and on our ſelues, it might iuſtly be counted preſumption; but the Lord, and the power of his might being the ground thereof, they either know not what is the might of his power, or elſe too too lightly eſteeme it, who account aſſured confidence thereon, preſumption. No doubt but many ſo deemed of Dauids cō
                        fidence, when he vndertooke the combate with Goliah: yea it is manifeſt that1 Sam. 17. 28. 33. his eldeſt brother Eliah, and alſo
Saul ſo iudged: but Dauids eye was lifted vp to God, hee was ſtrong in the power of Gods might,
                        1 Sam. 17. 37. which made him ſo bold and confident. Thus wee with like confidence and aſſurance may truſt vnto the ſame mighty power, though all the world count vs preſumptuous for it. The truth is that our aduerſaries might well obiect this againſt vs, if our confidence were in our owne power, or rather weakneſſe: but being in the power of Gods might, vniuſtly they ſlander vs, and moſt iniuriouſly impeach Gods mightie power.

                     TO conclude this firſt general point of Chriſtian courage and confidence in the Lord,The benefit of truſting to Gods power. and in the power of his might, great is the benefit thereof, and that in three reſpects eſpecially;

                     Wherin firſt we are to conſider the means whereby we may be prepared.
                     In the ſetting downe whereof, the Apoſtle declareth

                           1. By the kind thereof, Armour of God.
                           
                           2. By the ſufficiencie of it, whole armour.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 2. Chriſtians are Souldiers.
                     FOr the metaphor, it is taken from Souldiers, who in time of warre, when they enter the field againſt their enemies, are ſubiect to much danger and many annoyances of ſwords, ſpeares, darts, arrowes, bullets, and ſuch like weapons of their enemies, and therefore for their better ſafegard vſe to be well prouided &amp; fenced with good armour. In that the Apoſtle exhorteth Chriſtians to put on armour, he giueth vs to vnderſtand, that,
                     
                        A Chriſtians courſe of life is a warfare:
                        
                           Doct. 1. Our life a warfare. for armour, eſpecially the vſe of armour, is a token of warre: armour is not giuen to a man to ſit with it at a fire, or to lye lazing on a bed, or wantonly to dance vp and downe, or follow paſtimes and pleaſures in it, but to fight: to this purpoſe many like metaphors are vſed. Chriſtians themſelues are called2 Tim. 2. 3. 
                        Souldiers; their courſe of life1 Tim. 1. 18.

                        aſſaults; in a word, this is a difference betwixt the Church in Heauen and in earth, that this is
militant, that triumphant.
                     
                     Thus hath God in wiſedome diſpoſed our eſtate on earth for weightie reaſons.Reaſons.
                     
                     1. The more to manifeſt his pittie, power, prouidence and truth in keeping promiſe: the ſtraits whereunto in this world we are brought, the promiſes which God hath made to deliuer vs, and the many deliuerances which we haue, ſhew that God pittieth vs in our diſtreſſes, that he is prouident and carefull for our good, and wiſe in diſpoſing euill to good, that hee is able to deliuer vs, and faithfull in doing it. For this cauſe didExod. 14. 17. 18. God ſuffer the Iſraelites to goe into Egypt, to be there kept in hard bondage, to be brought into many dangers, and ſet vpon by many enemies.
                     2. To make proofe of the gifts hee beſtoweth on his children. A ſouldiers valour is not knowne but in warre: in time of peace what difference is ſeene betwixt a valourous man, and timerous coward? by that ſore combate wheruntoIob 1. 12. 
                        Iob was brought, were the graces which God had beſtowed on him euidently made knowne.
                     3. To weine them the better from this world: for ſo long as all things are quiet in the world, without troubles, oppoſitions, and aſſaults, we are exceedingly prone to delight in it, and to ſay,Mat. 17. 4. 
                        It is good to bee heere. Much proſperity maketh many to be like thatLuke 12. 19.

                     4. To make Heauen the more longed for while wee are on earth, and the more acceptable when we come to poſſeſſe it. How earneſtly doth the ſouldier in tedious and dangerous combates deſire victorie? How welcome is triumph after warre? As a ſafe hauen to Marriners toſſed vp and downe in troubleſome ſeas, is moſt welcome; ſo Heauen to Chriſtians, whoſe life in this world is a warfare, a ſea-fare.

Indure hardneſſe. accordingly let vs carry our ſelues; a little ſleepe, a little food is enough for a ſouldier, hee lyeth not on beds of downe, he pampereth not his body with delicate cheare: but he watcheth much, hee fareth hard, and lyeth hard. Thus Chriſtians may not ſuffer themſelues to be ouertaken with the vaine delights and pleaſures of this world. Note what the Apoſtle ſaith of a Chriſtian ſouldier,2 Tim. 2. 4. 
                        No man that warreth intangleth himſelfe with the affaires of this life, that hee may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a ſouldier. Who hauing this armour thinke to take their eaſe, follow their pleaſures, embrace the world, they peruert the maine end of it: for it is giuen to ſtand, and to reſiſt; which if they doe not, vnworthy they are of armour, and ſhall be caſhired. Eaſe and reſt is not heere to be looked for, but rather temptations and aſſaults which wee muſt watch againſt, and when one conflict is paſt, looke for another, and reſiſt all as they come: of all things wee muſt take heed of ſecurity, and prouide that at any time wee be not vnfurniſhed: reade theIudges 18. 10. 27. hiſtorie of the people of
Laiſh, and make a ſpirituall application thereof.
                     Thus much for the Metaphor.
                  
                  
                     §. 3. The vſe of ſpirituall graces.
                     COnſider we now what is meant thereby. It is euident by theVerſe 14, 15, 16, 17. Apoſtles exemplification hereof, that ſuch ſpirituall ſanctifying graces, as God indueth his Saints withall, are the armour heere meant. In that theſe are compared to armour, obſerue that
                     
                        The graces of Gods Spirit are for ſafegard and defence.
                        
                           Doct. 2. Spiritual graces for defence. This is the maine and principall end of armour, as the Apoſtle himſelfe in this, and in the 13. verſe, plainely ſheweth: for in both places expreſly hee ſaith, that wee muſt put on and take to vs the whole armour of God for this very end, to ſtand againſt, and to reſiſt our enemies. Thus is righteouſneſſe as a breſt-plate, hope as an helmet, faith as a
ſhield, al for defence, as we ſhal after more diſtinctly ſhew: in the meane while let this general obſeruation be noted, both of ſuch as yet haue none of thoſe graces, and alſo of ſuch as haue them, or at leaſt thinke they haue them.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 For the firſt ſort,
 with what care and diligence are they to deſire and ſeeke after them,Who want them ſeeke them. being ſo needfull and neceſſary? what reſt can they giue vnto their ſoules, till they haue obtained them? would we not count him a madde man, or at leaſt weary of his life, who ſhould ruſh naked without any armor into the field among his deadly enemies? what then may we iudge of thoſe that liue in this world, among the mortall enemies of their ſoules, vtterly deſtitute of all ſauing graces? how many thouſands thus liue, as it were, weary of their ſoules, andActs 13. 46. 
                        iudge themſelues vnworthy of eternall life?
                     
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 
                         For the other ſort which haue theſe grace,
 they are to vſe them for their defence, as armour is vſed, and not for oſtentation.Who haue them, vſe them for defence. Armour is not giuen to iet vp and downe in it, and be proud of it, as many are of apparell. Let thoſe who haue no better gifts then ſuch as are called parts of nature, as wit, ſtrength, bewtie, and the like, boaſt in them, if they liſt: theſe are like light, ſleight, gay ſtuffes, which make children and fooles bragge. Gods graces are of a more ſound and ſolide ſubſtance, and therefore to be vſed accordingly, and not made a matter of ſhew &amp; oſtentation. Let this be noted of ſuch as are ouer conceited, and ſo proud of their knowledge, faith, patience, &amp; other graces.
                  
                  
                     §. 4. Chriſtians armour ſpirituall.
                     THus hauing handled the Metaphor,Why armour of God. and the meaning thereof, come wee to the amplification. The firſt point whereof is the kinde of armour heere ſet forth. It is called armour of God, and that in foure eſpeciall: reſpects,

                           1. It isJam. 8. 17. made of God, euen in heauen.
                           2. It isPſal. 119. 98. preſcribed of God, euen in his Word.
                           3. It is1 Cor. 1 4. giuen of God, euen by his Spirit.
                           4. It isHeb. 13. 21. agreeable to God, euen to his will.
                        
                     
                     All theſe doe ſhew that,
                     
                        The armour wherewith Chriſtians are fenced,
                        
                           Doct. 3. The Chriſtians armour is ſpirituall. 
                        is diuine, and ſpirituall. In this reſpect, ſaith the Apoſtle,2. Cor. 10. 4. 
                        The weapons of our warfare are not carnall: by denying one contrarie, he affirmeth the other: not carnall, that is, ſpirituall. The ſeuerall peeces after mentioned do euidently proue this point.
                     Our enemies are ſpirituall,Reaſon and their aſſaults ſpirituall: muſt not then our armour needs be ſpirituall? What other armour can ſtand vs in ſtead againſt ſuch enemies, ſuch aſſaults? as good haue a ſheete of paper on our naked breſts to keepe off a musket ſhot, as vſe any other armour then ſpirituall, againſt the ſpirituall aſſaults of ſpirituall enemies.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 Hereby is diſcouered the egregious folly of many in fencing themſelues againſt ſpirituall enemies:
Mans folly in fencing himſelfe. as
                     1. Of Coniurers, Sorcerers, and ſuch like, who imagine that the Diuell may be driuen away by charmes, and they kept ſafe from him by ſpels, circles, &amp;c.

Agnis Dei, &amp;c.
                     3. Of ſottiſh worldlings, who ſeeke to arme themſelues againſt the ſpirituall aſſaults of Satan by outward meanes, as againſt griefe of minde and terrour of conſcience, by1 Sam. 16. 16 muſicke, company, gaming, &amp;c. the truth is, that by theſe meanes great aduantage many times is giuen to the Diuell: for thus hee getteth a ſurer poſſeſſion in them▪
                     
                     Not much vnlike to theſe are they, who think by phyſicke to purge away trouble of conſcience: as ſoone may an Ague bee purged away by drinking cold water. All theſe are very childiſh and ridiculous toyes, meere ſcarcrowes, which the Diuell laugheth at.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 For our parts, ſeeing there is an armour of God,
 let vs be wiſe in diſtinguiſhing betwixt this and all counterfeit armour:Learne to diſcerne right armour. for this end obſerue wee diligently Gods word which deſcribeth it, and that ſo plainly as wee may eaſily diſcerne it: we haue no warrant to vſe any other: neither can we ſafely truſt to any other. Hauing therefore found which is the armor of God, ſeek we itJames 1. 17. 
                        from aboue of the Father of lights, from whom it commeth downe, andVerſe 5. 
                        it ſhall be giuen. Hauing receiued it, giue we the praiſe and glorie thereof to him that hath giuen it, and vſe it according to his will, ſo may we confidently truſt vnto it.
                  
                  
                     §. 5. Chriſtians armour compleate.
                     THe next point is the ſufficiencie of this armour, termed
whole armour. The
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Greek word is a compound word, and ſignifieth both all manner of armour that is needfull, and alſo ſuch compleate armour as couereth all the bodie, and leaueth no part naked or vnfenced. This is thus ſet downe both to commend vnto vs this armour, and alſoSee Doct. 6. to inſtruct vs how to vſe it. In the firſt reſpect I obſerue, that
                     
                        The armour of God is a compleate armour,
                        
                           Doct. 4. The armour of God is compleate. euery way ſufficient: ſufficient to defend vs in euery part, and ſufficient to keepe off and thruſt backe euery aſſault, and euery dart of our ſpirituall enemies. For the firſt, if wee well note the particular peeces of this armour hereafter deſcribed, we ſhall finde the Chriſtian ſouldier armed from top to toe: For the laſt,Verſ. 16. the Apoſtle ſaith of one peece, that by it all the fiery darts of the wicked may be quenched: if by one peece, much more by euery peece ioyntly together, may all aſſaults be repelled. Hence it is that the2 Tim. 3. 17. Scripture which preſcribeth this armour, is able to make the man of God abſolute.
                     
                     This armor being of God,Reaſon. it muſt needs be compleate, or elſe queſtion might be made of his power, as if he were not able to prouide ſufficient armour; or of his prouidence, as if he cared not to haue his ſouldiers well armed; or of his goodneſſe, as if hee were not moued with the wounds and foyles of his ſeruants, which for want of good armour they muſt needs receiue: but Gods power, prouidence and goodneſſe being without all defect, wee may conclude that this armour of God is compleate.
                     
                     
                         Neuer were any of the Saints ſo ſufficiently armed:Obiect. 1. for the Diuell hath ſtill found ſome part or other vnfenced, euen in the beſt; and thereby wounded them. Inſtance,

                        Anſ. The fault was not in the inſufficiencie of their armour, but in the negligent and careleſſe vſe thereof, as if a ſouldier which hath very good armour of proofe, euerie way compleat, ſhould either not at all, or very looſely put on his head-peece, or breſt-plate, or any other peece: and this is euident, becauſe in ſuch parts where ſome were wounded, other were well fenced. Noah and ſome other failed in the vſe of their breſt-plate of righteouſnes:
Peter failed in holding out his ſhield of faith. If the fault were in the armour, either in the weakneſſe or want of this or that peece, then would the Diuell without faile foile euery Chriſtian in one and the ſame part.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 This ſufficiencie of Gods armour ought to incite vs diligently and carefully to ſeeke after it.
 A ſouldier which is to go into a dangerous fight,Get this compleat armour. if at leaft he haue any care of his limbes and life, will not bee quiet till hee hath got good and compleate armour of proofe. How carefull was Saul well to furniſh Dauid when he was to enter combate with Goliah? rather then he ſhould want,1 Sam. 17. 38. 
                        Saul was ready to haue afforded him his owne, if it had beene fit. Loe heere is the compleate armour of God, ſufficient to keepe vs ſafe: let vs firſt labour to get it.

 let vs bee bold and confident in this armour of God,Be confident in it. becauſe it is of proofe, and compleate. It was this armour that made Dauid ſo confident againſt
1 Sam. 17. 45 
                        Goliah, though he had no outward armor on him. They who are well armed, and yet faint hearted, diſhonor him that gaue them their armour, abuſe the gift it ſelfe, and make themſelues ridiculous to all that ſee or know them.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 6. The armour of God to be vſed.
                     HItherto haue we handled the meanes appointed for our ſafetie: now we are to declare how this armour is to be vſed. Put on the whole armour.
                     
                     Heere are two points to be noted,

                           1. That we put on armour.
                           2. That we put on whole armour.
                           
                        
                     
                     This word put on, is a word of practiſe, by which the Apoſtle followeth his former metaphor, taken from ſouldiers which are in the field: they doe not as houſholders in the time of peace, let their armour hang on the walles without vſe of it, till it ruſt, but they make vſe of it by putting it on, wearing it, and putting it to the proofe; ſo
                     
                        Chriſtians ought to be well furniſhed alwayes,
                        Doct. 5. The graces of God to be imployed. 
                        and well prepared with the graces of Gods Spirit: they muſt euer haue them in readineſſe at hand to vſe them, and make proofe of them. In this ſence is thisRom. 13. 12. phraſe of putting on oft vſed, andCol. 3. 12. 1 Theſ. 5. 8. applied to many particular graces, yea to
Rom. 13. 14. Chriſt himſelfe, whereby is implied, that we ſhould apply Chriſt vnto our ſelues, and ſo make vſe of him, and of all his actions and ſufferings: yea alſo of all thoſe graces, which he conueyeth into vs. Other Metaphors are alſo vſed to ſet forth the ſame point:2 Tim. 1. 6. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        ſtirre vp the gift of God which is in thee (ſaith the Apoſtle.) The Metaphor is taken from a fire, which is of little vſe when it is couered ouer and ſmothered vp with aſhes, but ſtirred and blowne vp, it is of great vſe. Againe, our Lord vſeth another Metaphor to the ſame purpoſe,Mat. 12. 35. A good man (ſaith hee)
bringeth forth good things. As a wiſe man that hath ſtore of treaſure will not let it lye ruſting and cankering in his cheſt, (this is a note of a couetous miſer, who were as good be without treaſure as haue abundance, for he wanteth in his greateſt abundance, becauſe hee vſeth not that he hath) but bringeth forth and imployeth it for his own and others good: ſo doth a good man with the treaſure of grace which God hath beſtowed on him. Excellent Metaphors to illuſtrate and vrge this point.
                     All the benefit and good of a thing commeth from the vſe of it:Reaſon. as armour ruſting by the walls ſide, as fire ſmothered with aſhes, as money cankering in cheſts, ſo are the graces of Gods Spirit, if they be not imployed: though in themſelues they be neuer ſo excellent, yet to vs and others they are fruitleſſe and vnprofitable, without a right vſe of them. This Dauid, no doubt, well knew, and thereforePſal. 40. 10. 
                        hid not Gods righteouſneſſe in his heart.
                     
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 Farre ſhort come they of this Apoſtolicall direction,
 who vpon conceit that they haue as good armour as the beſt,A deceit to thinke a man may haue armour, and yet none ſeene vpon him. pleaſe themſelues therein, and yet ſhew forth no practiſe thereof: knowledge they haue, and well are they able to diſcourſe of the kindes of graces, and of the differences betwixt current and counterfeit grace, as alſo of the many wiles of Satan, and of the meanes to auoid them, and yet no proofe doe they giue of the ſoundneſſe of any grace in themſelues. For example, many imagine that they haue very good and ſound faith, and yet liue altogether by ſence: for while all things goe well, according to their deſire, they can beleeue and depend vpon God: but when any croſſe falleth vpon them, then their ſhield of faith is to ſeeke, euery dart pierceth them to the very heart. Other conceit they haue a good breſt-plate of righteouſnes, and yet no practiſe of pietie, none of charitie, to be obſerued in them. They are like thoſe of whom Saint
Iames
                        Iam. 2. 16. ſpeaketh, that can ſay to ſuch as are naked and deſtitute of daily food, bee you warmed and filled, notwithſtanding they giue them not thoſe things which are needfull for the body.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 
                         Let vs for our parts make proofe of the graces wee haue:
 what armour wee ſeeme to haue, let it bee ſeene on our backes.Make proofe of what thou haſt. Thinke we that we haue the ſhield of faith? Let vs liue by our faith,Heb. 11. as the Patriarches did: or the breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe?Job 29. 14. 
                        Let it couer vs as a robe: let vs be ſo conſcionable in practiſing the ſeuerall duties thereof, that with the teſtimony of a good conſcience we may ſay to God as Nehemiah did,Neh. 5. 19. 
                        Remember me, O my God, in goodneſſe for all that I haue done for thy people. Or the girdle of verity? let vs ſo vprightly and ſincerely behaue our ſelues, as we may with comfort ſay with honeſt Hezechiah,
                        Iſa. 38. 3. 
                        Lord remember how I haue walked before thee in truth. Thus may the generall doctrine be applied in all the particular branches of this Chriſtian armour: which that we may the rather doe, note what is further required: that the whole armour be put on.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 7. Euery grace to be vſed.
                     AS this particle, whole, is annexed to armour, to commend vnto vs the ſufficiencie of the armour of God, whereof we haue heard before: ſo this compound word,
whole armour, is inferred vpon that action of putting on, to teach vs, that it is not ſufficient to put on ſome parts and peeces thereof, but euery part and peece, the whole armour muſt be put on. From the true ſcope of the Apoſtles meaning, I gather that,
                     
                        The power of euery ſanctifying grace muſt be manifeſt in the life of a Chriſtian.
                        
                           Doct. 6. Euery grace to be manifeſted. This was it whereunto he exhorted before, ſaying,
                           Epheſ. 4. 15. expounded. 
                        Let vs in all things grow vp, &amp;c. There he vſeth a Metaphor taken from the members of a naturall body, implying that ſpirituall graces are to the ſpirit, as fleſhly members to a body; now if the body grow in ſome parts only, and not in euery part proportionably, (as if it ſhould grow all in the head, and not anſwerably in the legs, or all in the ſhoulders, and not at all in the thighes) it would bee but a monſtrous body: or if it abound with noiſome humors, which make it ſwel in ſome parts, thoſe humors wil be ſo far from preſeruing the body, that they will rather impaire the health, and ſhorten the life of it. So if a Chriſtian ſhall be hot in faith, and cold in loue; or haue great knowledge, and ſhew little obedience: or bee full of deuotion, and empty of diſcretion, ſurely hee is a monſtrous Chriſtian: the want of ſome graces make the other to bee of no vſe. Such profeſſors are a ſhame and diſhonor to others; they are full of noyſome and diſtempered humors, which will deſtroy that ſhew of ſpirituall life which they ſeeme to haue. Fitly may they be compared toDan. 2. 32. &amp;c. 
                        Nebuchadnezzars Image, whoſe head was of gold, but his feet of yron and clay: what was the end of that Image? the feet therof were ſmitten, and ſo all broken together. Such is like to be the end of al monſtrous Chriſtians.
                     But is it poſſible that any one Chriſtian ſhould haue all ſanctifying graces?Queſtion.
                     
                     Yea verily,Anſwere. it is not onely poſſible, but alſo neceſſarie that not onely any one, but euery one be endued with euery kinde of ſanctifying grace, which appertaineth to the eſſentiall being of a Chriſtian. For regeneration is as perfect in the kinde thereof, as our naturall birth.
                     Men ordinarily are borne with all the parts and members of a man: if not, they are eyther monſters, or at leaſt imperfect: but in the ſpirituall birth, which is

                        of God, there is no imperfection of parts, there are no monſters: all that are borne of the Spirit, haue all the eſſential parts of the Spirit; &amp; thus are al alike, though not in meaſure, yet in number of graces. For as the fleſh hath corrupted euery power of the ſoule &amp; part of the body, ſo doth the Spirit renew euery power and part of both. The Apoſtle teſtifieth of the Corinthians, that1. Cor. 1. 5, 7. 
                        in all things they were made rich, and not deſtitute of any gift.
                     Forceable and weightie motiues there are to vrge this point,Reaſons. as
                     
                         
1. God maketh nothing in vaine. Now then God hauing made this whole armor,God maketh nothing in vaine. whole armour muſt be put on. If a carefull and wiſe Captaine ſhould prouide ſufficient armour for all his ſouldiers, and ſome of them bee careleſſe in putting on euery peece thereof, might hee not bee offended with them, and that iuſtly? Much more ſhould we prouoke God, by neglecting any thing which he in his good prouidence hath prouided for vs.
                     
                         
2. Wee ſtand in great need of euery peece of this armour: for vnleſſe we put on euery peece,Euery grace needfull. we lye open to our enemies, euen as if we had put on neuer a peece: for they are very ſubtil, they narrowly view vs on euery ſide, and ſoone can eſpie if any part be naked. What if a ſouldier haue an helmet and want a breſt-plate, if a dart light vpon his breſt, and pierce to his heart, what good getteth he by his head-peece? Or if hee haue a breſt-plate, and want a girdle to knit it cloſe, or taſſets and cuſhes to couer his belly? Thus if faith, or hope, or righteouſneſſe, or veritie, or any other part of the Chriſtian armour bee wanting, the Diuell can thereby take his aduantage to deſtroy the ſoule: ſo as not onely duetie to God, but ſafety of our ſelues may moue vs to put on the whole armour.
                     
                         
3. True triall of the truth of thoſe graces, which wee ſeeme to haue,Who haue not euery grace, haue neuer a grace. is made by the concurrence &amp; meeting of al together. Single graces, that is, graces which stād alone, are counterfeit graces. Faith without righteouſnes is preſumption: righteouſnes without truth is hypocriſie, &amp; ſo in the reſt. Al come from the ſame fountaine: he that hath not all, hath none at all.
                     
                         How needful is it that we follow the counſel of2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, &amp;c. Saint
Peter,
                        
                           Vſe 1
 which is, to giue all diligence to ioyne one grace vnto another,Adde grace to grace. to knowledge faith, to faith hope, to hope righteouſneſſe, to righteouſneſſe truth, to truth patience, and ſo in the reſt? Thus will it not repent the Lord to haue prouided whole armor for vs, when we ſhall vſe all. Thus ſhall we giue no aduantage to our ſpirituall enemies; thus ſhall we haue euident proofe of the Spirits abode in vs, and be aſſured that indeed we are borne anew.
                  
                  
                     §. 8. Mans endeauour to be added to Gods aſſiſtance.
                     THe two generall parts of the Apoſtles direction haue hitherto beene diſtinctly handled: now let vs conſider them ioyntly together. The firſt part is that wee bee
ſtrong in the Lord. The ſecond, that wee vſe thoſe meanes which God hath appointed for our ſafetie. Whence obſerue, that
                     
                        Gods aſsiſtance and mans endeauour concurre together: Doct. 7. they may not be ſeuered.Gods aſſiſtance and mans endeauour are ioyned together. Without Gods mighty power man can doe nothing: vnleſſe man put on the whole armour of God, God will doe nothing. This the Church knew right well,Cant. 1. 3. and therefore both prayeth vnto God to bee enabled by him (draw me) and alſo promiſeth to doe her vttermoſt endeauour, and follow his direction (wee will runne after thee.) The like we reade ofPſal. 119. 31. 
                        Dauid: but moſt clearely is this point laid downe byIoh. 6. 44, 45. Chriſt, who hauing ſaid, No man can come to mee, except the Father draw him, (wherby he ſheweth that God muſt enable man to come to him) addeth, Euery man that hath learned of the Father commeth to mee, (whereby he ſheweth, that man enabled of God, addeth his owne endeauour.)
                     Why Gods powerfull worke is neceſſary,Reaſons. hath beene ſhewed before on verſ. 10. namely, becauſe of our owne vtter inabilitie to doe any thing of our ſelues.Epheſ. 2. 5. Before God quickeneth vs, we are dead in ſinnes, no more able to doe any ſpirituall function, then a dead corpſe to doe any naturall function: yea, after we are quickned, we are
1. Cor. 15. 10. ſtill ſupported by Gods grace, which worketh in vs: yet being quickned wee muſt do our endeauour, becauſe of that order which the Lord hath in wiſdome appointed to bring vs to glory.
                     For this end doth God worke in vs both to will, and to doe, that we ſhould worke out our owne ſaluation, Phil. 2. 12. 13.

God worketh not vpon vs, as vpon ſtockes or ſtones, but giueth to vs life and abilitie, as when hee raiſed the Widdowes ſonne, the Rulers daughter, and Lazarus, he put life into them, and inabled them to mooue, riſe vp, walke, eate, and doe other functions of the liuing.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 By this is diſcouered the error of proud preſumptuous Papiſts on the one ſide,
 and of ſecure careleſſe Libertines on the other.Papiſts attribute too much to mans will. The Papiſts to eſtabliſh their owne power and ſtrength, hold and teach, that after the firſt motion and ſtirting of the heart, which they acknowledge to bee of God only,Bell, de grat. l. 5. c. 29. poteſt homo abſolute per liberum arbitrium benefacere ſivelit. a man abſolutely by his free will may doe well if hee will. But Chriſt ſaith of the branches which were in the vine, whoſe hearts were ſtirred vp,Iohn 15. 5. 
                        Without me yee can doe nothing.
                     
                     The care which the Apoſtle hath to direct them vnto the fountaine of ſtrength, the Lord, euen then when eſpecially hee vrgeth them to arme themſelues, argueth that without continuall ſtrength ſupplied vnto them from the Lord, they are not able to ſtand of themſelues againſt the aſſaults of their enemies.
                     Libertines fall into another extreame,Libertines too careleſſe in doing what they ought. they, to pamper their fleſh, and purſue their carnall delights, ſo referre all to the worke and power of God, that they are altogether careleſſe in vſing any meanes themſelues, vpon conceit that God is able of himſelfe to ſaue them, and that when God pleaſeth he wil ſaue them, do they in the meane time what they liſt. But fondly they argue from Gods power, who neglect the meanes which God hath appointed and reuealed, wherein and wherby he wil manifeſt his power.
Deut. 29. 29. His reuealed will is the ground of our faith and obedience: if we follow the direction of it, then may we ſafely truſt vnto the power of God; otherwiſe in attributing all to the grace of God, we abuſe it, andJude verſ. 4. 
                        turne it into want onneſſe. Were it not neceſſary for vs to doe what God enableth vs to do, as wel as truſt to the power of Gods might, the Apoſtle needed not haue been thus careful in ſtirring vs vp to arme our ſelues.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 As wee preſume not in truſting to our owne ſtrength,
 left we prouoke God to reſiſt vs, ſo neither tempt we God in neglect of the meanes which he hath appointed, leſt we cauſe God to forſake vs: but as wee looke for helpe and ſtrength from God, ſo muſt we be carefull in well vſing all thoſe meanes which God hath ordained for our helpe and ſafety. To this purpoſe tend all the exhortations in the Scripture, whereby any duety is required at our hands. Note the complaint of our Lord againſt Ieruſalem;
                        Mat. 23. 37. Totum ex Deo, non tamen quaſi dormientes, non quaſi vt non conemur, &amp;c. ſine voluntate tua non erit in te iuſtitia Dei, &amp;c. qui fecit te fine te, non te iuſtificat ſine te, &amp;c. Aug. de verb. Apo. ſerm. 15. 
                        How often would I haue gathered thy children together, and yee would not? Be we not like to them, lest wee be reiected as they were: Know we this for certaine, that God wil not with cart-ropes by force and violence, againſt our wills draw vs to Heauen.
                     To this end doth God take out of vs that ſtonie and inflexible heart which is in vs by nature, and giueth vs an heart of fleſh which is flexible, that it being made pliable by Gods Spirit, ſhould apply it ſelfe to Gods worke, as
Dauid did, Pſal. 119. 112. The truth is, that many Chriſtians are wonderfully wounded and foiled by the Enemie, becauſe of their owne idleneſſe and ſecuritie, in that they are backward in putting forth themſelues, and negligent in endeuouring to do what God inableth them to doe.
                     Loe here is compleate armour of God prouided for our defence and ſafetie; be we careful in putting it on and well vſing it.
                     Thus much for the meanes to be vſed.
                  
                  
                     §. 8. The end and benefit of Chriſtian armour.
                     THe end why this meanes is to bee vſed, followeth in theſe words; That yee may be able to ſtand, &amp;c. In ſetting downe this end, hee declareth the benefit of the fore named armour,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . which is an abilitie to ſtand, amplified by the enemie againſt whom we ſtand, the Diuell, and his ſubtiltie, in this word, wyles.
                     
                     The Apoſtle ſtill followeth and continueth his Metaphor taken from Souldiers, who being euery way well fenced and prepared againſt their enemies, ſtand ſtoutly againſt them, neither fall downe, flye away, nor giue ground.
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Wherefore this word ſtand, is a word of ſafetie and freedome from danger; yea, of victory and conqueſt, implying, that they which are well prepared with the armour of God, ſo long as they well vſe it, can neither bee ſlaine, nor taken captiues, nor beaten downe, nor made to flye, nor yet foiled or put backe, and forced to giue ground, but ſtand faſt and ſafe vpon their ground, yea ſtand faſt in the field when their enemies are driuen away, and ſo remaine Conquerors, as we ſhalVerſe 13. after heare. And this is all the conqueſt which in this world wee can looke for, to keepe our ſelues ſafe, that we be not conquered or foiled, and that we giue no aduantage to our enemies. As for the vtter ſubduing of the Diuel and his hoſt, that belongeth to Chriſt our Captaine and Champion.
                     This ſafe ſtanding being laid downe as the end why this armour of God is giuen, and declaring the benefite which followeth vpon the well vſing of the armour, theſe two Doctrines naturally flow from thence,
                     1. There is no hope,Doct. 8. no poſsibilitie of remaining ſafe without ſpirituall armour.
                     2. They who well put on the armour of God, Doct. 9. and vſe it as they ought, are ſafe and ſure, and ſo may be ſecure.

                     FOr the firſt,No ſafetie without armour. that which the Prophet ſaith of one peece of this armour, the ſhield of faith, I may well apply to the whole armour, if yee haue it not on you,Iſa. 7. 9. 
                        Surely yee ſhall not be eſtabliſhed, yee cannot ſtand.
                     Without this armour wee are naked,Reaſon 1. and lye open to euery dart and ſhot of our ſpirituall enemies: and are no more able to free our ſelues from the power of the Diuel, then a poore ſilly Lambe or Kid from a roaring Lion or rauenous Beare. If being vnfenced, we ſtand ſafe, it muſt be either by reaſon of the goodneſſe of the Diuell, that he pittieth vs, and cannot finde in his heart to take any aduantage againſt vs; or of his careleſneſſe and blindneſſe, that he prieth not about vs, or obſerueth when, &amp; where we are fenced or naked; or of his weakneſſe, that he is not able to pierce and wound vs, though wee be naked: but ſuch is his malice, his ſubtiltie, and ſedulitie; ſuch alſo his power (as wee ſhall after heare) that none can imagine there ſhould be any ſuch goodneſſe, careleſneſſe, blindneſſe, or weakneſſe in him.
                     Beſides,Reaſon 2. by neglecting to vſe this armour prouided of God, wee prouoke God to caſt vs into the power of our enemies, and to giue them power ouer vs,1 King. 22. 20, 21, &amp;c. as he dealt with Ahab.
                     
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 How egregiouſly doe they deceiue themſelues,
 who conceiue that though they haue no part or peece of this armour of God,Many ouerbold. they can be as ſafe and ſure, and may be as ſecure as they who haue the whole armour on them; much like to the ſeuen ſonnes of Sceua, who ouerboldly ventured to adiure an euill ſpirit (Acts 19. 14, 15, 16.) but what was the iſſue? being vnarmed they could not ſtand, they were ouercome and forced to flye.
                     Many thinke there needeth no ſuch care about faith, righteouſneſſe, ſinceritie, &amp;c. as ſome doe take:
                     For ought they ſee,Obiect. they are moſt aſſaulted and moſt foiled, who are moſt buſie and diligent in putting on this armour, and fitting it to them.
                     To grant that they which put on this whole armour of God are moſt aſſaulted,Anſwer. becauſe the Diuell without any great aſſaulting, preuailes againſt ſuch as haue it not on; I vtterly deny that they are moſt foyled: for they who are without it are cleane vanquiſhed, and in the power of the Diuell, which the other neuer ſhall be.
                     Yea but ſay they,Obiect. 2. we find and feele no ſuch matter, we are very quiet, no way moleſted.
                     I eaſily beleeue it:Anſwere. but what is the reaſon? becauſe the Diuell hath them in his power, hee needeth not eagerly purſue them.
                     Miſerable is that reſt and quiet which they haue:Simil. euen like to that which the poore Kid hath, when it is brought into the Lions den, or the Mouſe when it is in the Cats mouth, the Cat can play with the Mouſe when ſhee hath once caught it: and the Lion can let the Kid lye quiet in his den, while he rangeth and roreth after that prey which is out of his clutches. But what ſecurity of life haue theſe that are ſo taken? their ſecuritie is, that they are ſure to be gnawed to peeces and deuoured. This is the caſe of thoſe who being deſtitute of the armour of God, yet thinke themſelues quiet and well. They are faſt bound with the chaines of ſinne, and wholy in the Diuels power, where he ceaſeth to moleſt them for a while, but rather dallieth with them, while he eagerly purſues ſuch as haue on this armour, and are out of his power, and ſtand manfully againſt him. Againſt theſe he caſteth all the darts hee can, but all in vaine, as the next Doctrine ſheweth.

                        are ſafe and ſure, and may bee ſecure. Saint Peter exhorting Chriſtians to ſeeke after ſuch graces as may be compriſed vnder this armour, expreſly ſaith,2 Pet. 1. 10. 
                        If yee doe theſe things, yee ſhall neuer fall. Saint Iohn ſaith of one peece of this armour, namely faith, that1 Iohn 5. 4. 
                        it is the victory which ouercommeth the world. What then may bee ſaid of this whole armour, of euery peece of it together? Saint Paul goeth yet further, and ſaith of himſelfe, and of other Chriſtians like himſelfe, who haue put on this armour,
Rom. 8. 37. 
                        We are more then Conquerers.
                     
                     The points which haue bin before deliuered,Reaſons. that this is compleate armour, the compleate and whole armour of God, doe ſufficiently confirme this point.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         A ſtrong motiue this is to perſwade vs to put on the whole armour of God.
 This is the maine end which the Apoſtle aimeth at in laying downe this end,Be perſwaded to vſe this armour. to ſhew that as this is armour of proofe in it ſelfe, ſo it will ſufficiently defend vs, and keepe vs harmeleſſe. If at any time wee be foiled, the fault is our owne, wee can blame none but our ſelues, becauſe the Lord giueth ſuch meanes whereby
wee may be able to ſtand. Is it a benefit to ſtand faſt and ſafe? Is it a matter to bee deſired to bee kept free from ſpirituall wounds and hurts, yea from eternall bondage and ſlauerie vnder ſinne, Satan, and other mortall enemies of our ſoules? and from euerlaſting torment and torture that followeth thereupon? (how blinde are they which ſee it not! how fooliſh are they which regard it not!) If this (I ſay) bee a benefit, then take notice of the meanes whereby wee may bee inabled to ſtand faſt in that libertie which Chriſt hath purchaſed for vs, and made free from the forenamed ſlauerie: and withall make conſcience, and giue all diligence to vſe the means aright. It is a point of notorious folly to be deſirous of a thing, and careleſſe in doing that whereby our deſire may bee accompliſhed. Yea, it is a cunning wile of the Diuell in good things to make men ſeparate the meanes from the end, but in euill the end from the meane; as to make men deſire and looke for the good and happie end of righteouſneſſe, and yet bee backward in walking in that way that leadeth thereto: and contrariwiſe, eagerly and ſwiftly to runne in the way of ſinne, and yet not feare the wages of ſinne, and the Iſſue of that courſe. In the firſt kinde Balaam was deceiued.Numb. 23. 10. In the ſecond Euah was deluded. Balaam deſired to dye the death of the righteous; but careleſſe hee was in leading ſuch a life as brought foorth ſuch a death.Gen. 3. 4. 
                        Euah was perſwaded ſhee ſhould not dye, and yet feared not to eate of that fruite,Gen. 2. 17. againſt which death was denounced. Let the fearefull end of both theſe make vs wiſe againſt theſe wiles. Worldly men are wiſe enough herein, if they obſerue a good benefit to bee had, they will ſeeke how it may be obtained, and do with all diligence that whereby it may be obtained. This maketh them to paſſe ouer Sea and Land to get ſuch commodities as their owne Land affordeth not: this maketh them when they feare enemies, to haue all warlike prouiſion readie; oft to muſter their men, to keep continuall watch and ward at their chiefe port-townes, with the like.To ſtand. Now this end heere laid downe, being a matter of ſo great conſequence (for if we ſtand not faſt, but ſuffer our ſelues to be foiled and ouercome, no leſſe damage and danger followeth thereof, then loſſe of eternall happineſſe on the one ſide, and vtter deſtruction on the other.) Why ſhould we be more fooliſh in ſpirituall matters, then worldlings are in temporall? They indeede are more ſenſible of temporall things, whether good, or euill. Let vs therefore in ſpirituall matters giue the better heed to the direction of Gods word: that faith may make vs as wiſe, as ſence maketh them.

Much might be ſpoken of the creation, nature, fall, and many other points of the Diuell: but I will content my ſelfe with ſuch points as may moſt ſerue for our preſent purpoſe, which is to ſhew how fearefull and terrible an enemie he is.
                  
                  
                     §. 12. Satan a terrible enemie.
                     FOr the better vnderſtanding whereof,What Diuels were by creation. know, that the Diuels by creation were good Angels, as powerfull, wiſe, quicke, ſpeedie, inuiſible, immortall, &amp;c. as any other Angels: equall in euery reſpect, but inferiour in no reſpect to the very beſt Angels.
                     When they fell they loſt not their naturall ſubſtance,What they loſt by their fall. and eſſentiall properties thereof, no more then man loſt his when he fell: for as man remained to be not only fleſh and bloud, but alſo a liuing, yea and a reaſonable creature after his fall, ſo the Diuell remaineth to bee a ſpirit, inuiſible, immortall, quicke, ſpeedie, &amp;c. as before: onely the qualitie of his nature and properties is altered from good to euill: as powerfull as he was before to good, ſo powerfull is he now to euill; inuiſible and quicke hee is, wonderfull cloſe and ſpeedie in working miſchiefe, hee was not more deſirous of good before his fall, then ſince he is miſchieuous, and euen ſet vpon euill.
                     There are foure eſpeciall things which make the Diuell very fearefull;What makes them terrible
                     
                     Firſt, his power. Secondly, his malice. Thirdly, his ſubtiltie. Fourthly, his ſedulitie and ſpeede.
                     Who feareth not a powerfull enemie? This made
1 Sam. 17. 11. 
                        Goliah ſeeme ſo terrible. If an enemie bee malicious, euen for his malice hee is feared as1 Sam. 22. 22 
                        Doeg: or if hee bee craftie and ſubtill, for which2 Sam. 15. 31 
                        Achitophel was feared: yea alſo the enemies of Iſrael were accounted fearefull in regard of their ſwiftneſſe,Iſa. 5. 26. 
                        That they came hastily with ſpeede. How terrible will all theſe make an enemie, when they all meete together? It may bee thought that if an enemie bee malicious, and wanteth power, hee may conſume himſelfe with malice, and doe little hurt to others: or if hee bee powerfull and malicious, but want witte, crafte, and ſubtiltie, hee may like an vnbridled Horſe runne on head-long in his powerfull malice to his owne ruine and deſtruction: or though to his power and malice, ſubtiltie bee alſo added, yet if hee bee ſlow and careleſſe, hee is the leſſe feared, in hope that hee may be preuented in all his enterpriſes. But where malice is ſtrengthned by might, might whetted on by malice; both malice and power guided by craft, craft and all ſtirred vp by diligence, ſedulitie, and ſpeed, who can ſtand againſt ſuch an enemie?
                     Now all theſe do in a very high degree concurre in the Diuell, as1 Pet. 5. 8. Expounded. Saint Peter doth notably ſet them downe in this deſcription of the Diuell; Your aduerſarie the Diuell like a roaring Lion walketh about, ſeeking whom to deuour. His name

roaring, addeth terror thereunto: laſtly, his walking vp and downe, ſheweth his ſedulitie. Of his power, malice and ſedulitie, I ſhal haue occaſion more diſtinctly to ſpeak on the 12. verſe.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 13. The Diuels wiles.
                     SAtans ſubtiltie is heere particularly expreſſed vnder this word,Satans ſubtiltie. 
                        wyles. The Greeke word ſignifieth artificiall, crafty,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            &amp;c. Chryſoſt. cunning conueyances of matters, windings vp and downe, and turning euery way to get the greateſt aduantage. Fitly is this word vſed by the Apoſtle, for his temptations and aſſaults are very cunning, full of much deceit, of many windings, which make him ſo mightily preuaile againſt the greateſt ſort of the world, euen againſt all that are not ſtrong in the Lord, and wiſe in well vſing the whole armour of God.
                     The titles which in Scripture are giuen to the Diuell, doe euidently imply his great craft. He is termed a Dragon, and a Serpent, which of al other beaſts are counted the craftieſt, andGen. 3. 1. Mat. 10. 16. wiſeſt: yea to ſhew that he hath had long time of experience to make him the more ſubtill and crafty: he is called anReu. 12. 3, 9. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            quaſi 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            guarus, peritus. Plat. in Crat. 
                        old Serpent, a great red Dragon. There are names in Greek which we ordinarily tranſlate Diuell, that yet further ſignifie his great ſubtilty, for they note out his great knowledge and vnexperienced skill.
                     As his names are, ſo is his practiſe, full of many windings, full of much craft. It is an infinite taske, a matter of impoſſibility to diſcouer all his cunning ſtraragems and ſubtill deuices. He hath old trickes, which long hee hath vſed, becauſe by long continued experience, he hath found that ſilly men are ſoone deceiued with them, and that the harme of ſome cannot warne others: and yet doth he daily inuent new vpon new, euer ſhifting from one to another: if one will not ſerue, he hath another preſently in a readineſſe. For diuers perſons, diuers conditions, and diſpoſitions, he hath diuers temptations. Sometimes hee playeth the part of a roaring rauenous Lion: ſomtimes of a craftie fawning Fox: ſometimes appearing in his owne ſhape, ſometimes changing himſelfe into an Angell of light, doing any thing for his aduantage. Becauſe the Apoſtle holdeth himſelf cloſe to the metaphor taken from warre, I will alſo follow it, and vnder it diſcouer ſome few particular ſtratagems, leauing it to the particular meditation of others to finde out other.
                     1. He can well tell how to marſhall and ſet his armie in array;Satans ſhifts. he well knoweth how to order his temptations: For firſt he vſeth to make the on-ſet with light skirmiſhes and to begin with ſmall temptation; and then by degrees to follow with greater and mightier forces. Thus came he toGen 3. 1. 
                        Eue; firſt onely he made a queſtion whether God had forbidden them any of the trees: and then by degrees he cameGen. 3. 4. directly to contradict the expreſſe word of God. So when he tempted Chriſt,Mat. 4. 3. 9. he began with a doubt whether Chriſt were the Sonne of God or no, and laſtly tempted him to monſtrous idolatry.
                     Thus he maketh men careleſſe at the firſt, and his temptation lightly to be regarded, till he haue gotten ſome aduantage; which when he hath gotten, he will follow with all the might and maine that poſſibly he can.
                     2 If thus he preuaile not, but at firſt he be put backe, he can change his ranckes and weapons: he can alter his temptations, and beginne with fierce and violent aſſaults. Thus he ſet onJob 1. 13. &amp;c. &amp; 2. 7. 
                        Iob. If hee cannot ſeduce men by mouing them to make light account of ſin, he will perſwade them that euery ſinne is moſt hainous, that their ſins are vnpardonable. If hee cannot make them ſuperſtitious, he will ſtriue to make them prophane: and thus help one temptation with another.
                     3. If he obſerue the forces of the Lords Souldiers to be ſtrong and well ordered and fortified, then his endeauour will be pollitikely to allure ſome out of their rancks, and ſo make a breach; it ſeemeth that thus he preuailed much, and got great aduantage in the Church of Corinth. For thus hee bred1 Cor. 1 11. Schiſmes and contentions among them. Whereupon the Apoſtle exhortethIbid. 7. 20. 
                        euery man to abide in the ſame vocation wherein he was called. Thus in theſe our dayes hath hee cauſed muſt trouble in Gods Churches by the inordinate walking of many perſons; who leauing their owne places, haue cauſed diuiſions, ſects, and ſeparations from the Church.
                     4. If hee obſerue ſome prouident Captaine, watchfull ouer the Lords armies, and carefull to keepe his ſouldiers in good order, animating and incouraging them, then will the Diuell vſe the1 King. 22. 31 King of Arams ſtratagem: all his forces ſhall be bent againſt that Captaine. Thus hee fiercely ſet vpon our chiefe CaptaineMatth. 
                              •
                           . in the wilderneſſe, and throughout the whole courſe of his life; but eſpecially
Mat. 26. 37. in the Garden, and&amp; 27. 46. on the Croſſe. Thus did he deſire toLuke 22. 31. winow the Apoſtles: Thus doth he ſorely tempt Magiſtrates, Miniſters, &amp; ſuch as haue charge ouer others.
                     5. If he preuaile not againſt them, rather then faile, he will ſet vpon the weakeſt. Thus dealt he by the miniſtery of Heretikes, who2 Tim. 3. 6. 
                        led captiue ſimple weomen. And thus in our dayes dealeth he by the miniſtery of Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, Separatiſts, and all other Sectaries.
                     6. If by none of theſe meanes hee can accompliſh his plots, as hee deſireth, face to face, or force againſt force, then will he lay ſome ſecret ambuſhments or other, to ſet on the Lords ſouldiers vnawares behinde their back, like to that ſtratagem ofJoſ 8. 4. 
                        Ioſhuah, and ofIudg. 20. 29. the Iſraelites: as when he ſuffers Chriſtians to goe on in doing the worke of the Lord, and performing ſuch dueties as belong vnto them, but will come behinde, and caſt into their hearts ſome conceits of merit and pride. Thus he gaue2 Cor. 12. 7. 
                        Paul a backe-blow. Thus he ouercommeth the Papiſts, and many ignorant perſons among vs. Sometimes alſo hee will caſt luſtfull and worldly thoughts and cares into them, and ſoMat. 13. 22. choake all.
                     7. If the Lords ſouldiers be ſo circumſpect, as neither by force nor fraud hee can preuaile, hee will not ſticke to change his flag: and ſeeme to fight vnder the Lords banner, asEz 4. 4. Neh. 6. 2. 
                        Tobiah, Sanballat, and other deadly enemies of the Iewes endeauoured to doe. In this reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith, that's2 Cor. 11. 13, 14, 15. 
                        Satan transformeth himſelfe into an Angell of light, and his Miniſters into the Apostles of Christ. Thus oftentimes hee preuaileth with ſuch as are of tender conſciences to make many needleſſe ſcruples, by accounting ſuch things to bee ſinne, which Gods word neuer made ſinne, and by thinking many things to be neceſſary dueties, which belong not at all vnto them.
                     Thus haue we a taſte of ſome of his wiles, I will not further range foorth into this ſpacious field, leſt I bee too tedious.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         Hauing ſuch an enemie as the Diuell is,
 had wee not need to bee ſtrong in the Lord,See Doct. 3. of verſ. 10. and in the power of his might? this enemy hauing ſo many wyles, had wee not need be alwaies prepared with the whole arm or of God? aſſuredly if we be not ſtrong in the power of Gods might, there is no ſtanding againſt the Diuell. If at any time we be without the whole armour of God, doubtleſſe we ſhal ſoone be ouertaken with ſome of his wiles.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 How doth this which hath beene ſaid of the Diuell and his wyles,
 commend vnto vs the prouident care of God ouer vs, who keepeth vs ſafe from ſuch an enemy, and from ſuch wiles? and how doth it ſet foorth the excellencie of the fore-named whole armour of God? Very excellent muſt needs that armour be, which is able to keepe vs ſafe from ſo potent and malicious an enemie, who hath ſo many wiles to deceiue vs. This ſheweth it to be very compleate and euery way ſufficient, for while we haue it on, well fitted to vs, all the craft of the Diuell cannot finde a naked place where to wound vs, his ſtrength is not able to pierce it; no though his craft and ſtrength be both whetted on with malice. Is there not now great reaſon we ſhould put it on and alwaies keepe it on? that we neither wake, nor ſleepe, be alone, or in company without it?
                     
                        
                           Vſe 3 Labour to haue our eyes enlightned (that we may diſctie thoſe wiles of the Diuel)
 and to be filled with ſpiritual prudence and wiſdome, that we eſcape theſe ſnares. Let vs preſerue in vs an holy iealouſy ouer our ſelues, &amp; ſuſpition of the Diuel and his wiles, fearing left he ſhould find vs ſomewhere vnarmed, and ſometime vnprepared (for otherwiſe we are ſafe.) Gods word is able to afford vnto vs wiſdome enough to auoid his wiles. ForPſal. 119. 98

                     For wee wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt Principalities, againſt Powers, againſt worldly Gouernours, Princes of the darkneſſe of this world, againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſe in heauenly things.

                        IN this verſe is laid downe the motiue which the Apoſtle vſeth, to vrge the fore-named direction. It may haue a double reference Firſt, generall to the former exhortation, Be ſtrong, &amp;c. yea, and put on the whole armour, &amp;c. becauſe we haue ſuch enemies as are heere deſcribed. Secondly, particular to the laſt clauſe of the former verſe, where he ſhewed that we were to ſtand againſt the Diuell, ſo it ſerues as an amplification of them: for if the queſtion be asked, what is the Diuell, that we ſhould be ſo prepared againſt him? theſe words ſet him forth; not fleſh and blood, but principalities, &amp;c. The firſt particle

                           n. 
                        for, being a cauſall particle, which intimateth a reaſon, implieth the firſt reference: the immediat connexion of this verſe vpon the laſt clauſe of the former verſe, implieth the ſecond. Both may well ſtand together: for both import one and the ſame thing: namely, that becauſe wee haue ſo dreadfull and deadly enemies, wee ought to bee well prepared againſt them.
                  
                  
                     §. 2. Danger maketh watchfull.
                     FRom the inference then of this verſe, and from the force of the Apoſtles argument, I collect, that
The greater danger we are ſubiect vnto,
                        Doct. 1. 
                        the more watchfull and carefull we muſt be for our ſafety.
                        The more danger we are in, the more watchfull we muſt be. When Chriſt obſerued what a ſore agony he was to enter into, he did not only watch and pray himſelfe, but called vpon his Diſciples toMat. 26. 38, 40, 41. 
                        watch and pray: and becauſe they did not, he rebuked them for their ſluggiſhneſſe. Saint1 Pet. 5. 8. 
                        Peter vrgeth this dutie of watchfulneſſe vpon a like reaſon; namely, becauſe we haue ſo feareful an enemy▪
                        Ioſ. 9. 12, &amp;c. &amp; 10. 1, 2, &amp;c. Outward temporal dangers make naturall men watchfull and carefull for their temporal eſtates and liues, as the hiſtories of all times and ages ſhew. Seeing then that ſpirituall dangers are much more fearfull, ought we not to be much more carefull?
                     If we be,Reaſon we doe not only ſhew that we haue regard of our ſoules, and ſeeke the good of them, but alſo we ſhall procure much good vnto them, and preuent and keepe away much miſchiefe from them.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         What falſe conſequences doe moſt make of that ſpirituall danger,
 whereunto they vnderſtand that they are ſubiect by reaſon of their ſpirituall enemies? Euen cleane contrary to this inference of the Apoſtle, and the wiſdome thereby taught vs; and that in two extreames: one of preſumption, the other of deſpaire: for ſome, when they heare of ſuch enemies as are heere deſcribed, they doe too vainely, careleſly, and proudly contemne them, likeIudges 9. 28. 
                        Gaal: other too meanely, baſely, and ſlauiſhly dread them, likeIſa. 7. 2. 
                        Ahaz.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 3. Againſt preſumption.
                     THe former extreame,Preſumption ariſeth from which is preſumption, ariſeth partly from too great a conceit of our ſelues, and of our owne ſtrength; and partly from too light credence and beleefe of that which is recorded of the Diuell.
                     That ſelfe-conceit maketh vs fondly imagine that wee are well able to reſiſt all temptations of the Diuell,1. Selfe conceit. or any of his inſtruments: whereupon many are ready to lay (when they are exhorted to take heed of the Diuell, and of his ſtrong temptations) I defie the Diuell and all his wicked crue, he can doe no hurt to me: I can (I thanke God) eaſily auoid his temptations the gates of hell cannot preuaile againſt mee; and yet proud ſilly fooles, they are ouertaken and ouercome with euery ſlight temptation.Luke 22. 33. 56. 57. 
                        Peter (though otherwiſe a man of good gifts) was ſomewhat too conceited of himſelfe, and too much inclined to this extreame, and yet when he was to ſtand to it, a ſilly wench daunted him.
                     
                        Light credence maketh vs thinke the Diuell cannot be ſo terrible,2. Incredulity as he is ſet forth to be; but that the things which are written and ſaid of him and his wiles, are but as ſcarcrowes and bugbeares to make men afraid, like to olde tales of the walking of ſpirits, of fairies, hobgoblins, &amp;c. This incredulitie much hindereth the power of ſuch exhortations, directions, admonitions and rebukes, which are giuen vs for our good. Both Peter and the other Diſciples were ſomewhat tainted here with: for whenMat. 26. 31. &amp;c. Chriſt told them all,Ioh. 13. 36, &amp;c. that all of them ſhould be offended by him, and that Peter in particular ſhould deny him, none of them would beleeue it: Peter ſaith, Though all ſhould, yet he would neuer: and againe, though he ſhould die, yet would he not deny Chriſt: and ſo ſaid all the Diſciples.

                           h deſpaire. ariſeth partly from too deepe an apprehenſion of the power of the Diuell (as if his power were infinite, and he were able to do whatſoeuer his malice led him vnto, and ſo could doe what hee would: or vnlimited, God letting the raines looſe vnto him, and holding him in no further then he liſt himſelfe, and ſo he might doe what he could, like an vntamed horſe that is not curbed and bridled in) and partly from too light an eſteeme of that power which is to be had in God, and of the great helpe and benefite which the whole armour of God affordeth, as if God were not able to make vs ſtrong enough, nor that whole armour ſufficient to make vs ſafe.
                     Theſe two cauſes of deſpaire made the Iſraelites often times vtter moſt deſperat ſpeeches againſt God: for when
Num. 13. 29. 33 34. they heard that in Canaan (the Land which was giuen them for inheritance) the people were ſtrong that there were men of great ſtature,
                        &amp; 14. 3 4. &amp;c 
                        euen Grants therein, that the Cities were walled, and exceeding great, they deſperately expoſtulated with the Lord, why he brought them into that Land to fall by the ſword, and in deſpaire of euer poſſeſſing Canaan, whou

                           •
                        eds returne againe into Egypt: and another time they plainly made doubt of Gods power, ſaying,
Pſal. 78. 19, 20. 
                        Can God prepare a table in the wilderneſſe? Can he giue bread? As theſe Iſraelites murmured againſt God, and made queſtion of his power and truth in performing his promiſes, in regard of their temporall enemies, whom they iudged to bee too ſtrong for them: ſo doe many in regard of their ſpirituall enemies. Thus wee ſee how prone wee are to peruert thoſe things to our deſtruction, which the Lord hath ſet forth for our inſtruction. Heere the Apoſtle layeth downe both the meanes for our defence; and alſo the danger to which wee are ſubiect, that we ſhould be the more carefull in arming our ſelues: we either preſumptuouſly defie our enemies, and care not to vſe any meanes of ſafegard; or elſe are too timerouſly daunted with our enemies, and thinke the Lords defence can doe vs no good.
                     Wherefore that in hearing the great danger wherein we are by reaſon of our enemies heere deſcribed, we take not occaſion thereby to fall into any of theſe extreames, but rather the more carefully auoide them, and keepe in the middle way, which is, ſo much the more earneſtly to flye vnto the power of Gods might, and ſo much the more carefully to keep faſt on the whole armour of God; I thought good before-hand to deliuer this inſtruction, which naturally ariſeth from the force of the Apoſtles reaſons.
                     Now come wee more distinctly to handle the words themſelues.
                  
                  
                     §. 5. Expoſition of the words.
                     IN this verſe is a Deſcription of a Chriſtian combate.
                        Verſe 12. Summe.
                        
                     
                     The parts are two. In the firſt is noted the kinde of combate, wrestle.
                     
                     In the ſecond are ſet forth the Combatants, or the Perſons, which on either ſide maintaine the combate. Theſe are on the one ſide Defendants; on the other ſide Aſſaulters, which are largely deſcribed; &amp; that both negatiuely,
not fleſh and blood, and affirmatiuely, but principalities, &amp;c.
                     The firſt point in order to be handled, is the kinde of combate, implied vnder this word wreſtle. In the originall it is thus ſet downe word for word,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        There is a wrestling. Wee may not thinke that hereby is meant a matter of ſport, as our Engliſh word, wrestling, may ſeeme to imply: for though the
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Greek word, as well as the Engliſh, be ſometimes attributed to a ſtrife of ſport, yet is it alſo vſed for a ſerious and fierce fight and combate. The Greek word according to the proper
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            dicitur quia corpus 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            i, quatitur. notation of it, ſignifieth ſuch a ſtrife as maketh the body of him that ſtriueth to ſhake againe.
                     It implieth then that the combate heere ſpoken of, is not a light skirmiſh, with enemies aloofe off, but a grapling with them hand to hand; &amp; in that reſpect the more fierce and dangerous. If they were far off from vs, and aloofe ſhould ſhoote or throw their weapons againſt vs, we might thinke to eſpie their darts before they fall on vs, or that they might miſſe of their ayme: But the combate being, as it were, a grapling hand to hand, all ſuch hopes are taken away: for they are neere vs to eſpie where to annoy vs, and ſo may aſſault vs the more fiercely.
                  
                  
                     §. 6. The danger of a Chriſtians combate.
                     
                        OVr ſpirituall war is a ſore, fierce and dangerous war.
                        Doct. 2. It is a kinde of combate which will trie our proweſſe and courage,The Chriſtians werre a fierce warre. wherby proofe will ſoone be made whether our armor be armor of proofe or not, or whether we haue put on this whole armour.Mat. 4. 4. &amp;c. The truth of this was manifeſted in Chriſt our head, whom the diuel hurried from wildernes to pinacle, from pinacle to mountain: what the diuell did to Chriſt outwardly, and viſibly, he vſeth to doe to others inwardly and ſecretly. The eſtate and condition of Chriſt while hee liued on earth, is a liuely repreſentation of the eſtate and condition of his Church in this world.
Luke 22. 31. 
                        Peter felt ſuch a wreſtling, ſo did2 Cor. 12. 7. 
                        Paul, ſo doe all that ſlauiſhly yeeld not themſelues to the power of the Diuel.
                     Thus God ordereth our eſtate,Reaſons. 1. The more to manifeſt and magnifie the power of his might, and the ſufficiencie of his armour. For the ſorer the fight is, and the more dangerous,2 Cor. 12. 9. the greater doth that ſtrength appeare to be, and the more excellent the meanes whereby we are ſupported.
                     2. To make vs with greater and ſtronger confidence to depend and relye vpon him, as1 Sam. 30. 6. 
                        Dauid, and
2 Chr. 20. 12. 
                        Iehoſaphat.
                     
                     3. To vſe the meanes appointed more carefully, as theNeh. 4. 16. 17 Iewes who while they were working, were prepared againſt their enemies.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 This may ſerue as a meanes to make triall of our eſtate:
 if all be quiet within vs,Triall. that there bee no wreſtling, no fighting; or if any, now and then a light skirmiſh, it is to be feared that our enemies haue gotten poſſeſſion of vs, and we ſlauiſhly haue yeelded to them, and ſo madeIſa. 28. 15. a couenant with them. Fierce combates doe giue vs more aſſurance that the Lord is ſtill our God, and we his ſouldiers, then light or no aſſaults: for if the Diuell bee our Lord, he can let vs be quiet; but if our enemie, aſſuredly we ſhall feele his hand.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 This ſheweth the reaſon why ſo many faint,
 and are foiled:The cauſe of fainting. for it were no great matter to endure light and eaſie combates: but when wee come to bee ſhaken indeed, then to ſtand faſt is a token of extraordinary courage: this was it which proued theIob 2. 3. patience and courage of Iob.
                     
                     
                        
                           Vſe 3 
                         Thinke not that we haue done enough,
 when we haue paſſed ouer ſome light trials,Prepare for great conflicts but prepare for greater; we muſt come to a wreſtling. Marke what the Apoſtle ſaith of them which hadHeb. 10. 32, 36. endured a great fight, Yee haue neede of patience; and againe,&amp; 12. 4. 
                        Ye haue not yet reſiſted vnto blood.
                     
                     
                        
                           Vſe 4 For our comfort,
 note, that though wreſtling imply a ſore combate, yet it implieth not a conqueſt ouer vs: of this there is no feare: for Chriſt our head hath ouercome our enemie, andHeb. 2. 14. 15 
                        deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that he might deliuer all them, which for feare of death were all their life time ſubiect to bondage: hee
                        Epheſ 4. 8. 
                        hath led captiuitie captiue, and
                        Col. 1. 13. 
                        deliuered vs from the power of darkneſſe, that we might be free from being ouercome, though not from
wreſtling.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 7. None exempted from fight.
                     THe Defendants who maintain this wreſtling are compriſed vnder this particle we,
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . which includes himſelfe and all like to himſelfe, together with them to whom hee wrote, and all like vnto them: ſo that
                     
                        All of all ſorts are to wreſtle and fight this ſpirituall combate.
                        Doct. 3. Neither Miniſters,All muſt fight nor people, poore nor rich, male nor female, newly planted, nor old grown, none of whatſoeuer rancke, condition, eſtate, age, qualitie, &amp;c. exempted.
Gen. 3. 15. Whoſoeuer is of the ſeed of the woman, muſt looke to haue his heele bruiſed. There is enmitie betwixt the two ſeeds; theGen. 3. 1. Diuell ſpared not the woman which was the weaker veſſell, andMatth. 4. 3. hee feared not the head, Chriſt himſelfe, who was the ſtrongeſt of all. Who may thinke to be ſpared? who can imagine that Satan will feare to wreſtle with him?
                     God will haue all of all ſorts to be tried:Reaſons. and the Diuell beareth a like hatred againſt all:1 Pet. 5. 8. 
                        hee ſeeketh whom to deuoure: ſo he may deuour them, he careth not who they be: as a Wolfe ſpareth none of the flocke, ramme, ſheepe or lambe that he can come by.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 Let all,
 Miniſters and people, ſtrong and weake, all of al ſorts apply all the exhortations &amp; directions here deliuered vnto themſelues.All muſt apply the directions of the word. Let not the weaker ſort put them off vpon conceit that fierce combats belong to ſtrong Chriſtians; Satan hauing greateſt hope to preuaile againſt the weakeſt, will not faile to ſet on them: nor yet let the ſtronger put them off, vpon conceit that the diuell dareth not meddle with them: for though there may be ſome difference betwixt them and the weaker Chriſtians, yet the ſtrength of the ſtrongeſt is nothing in compariſon of the diuels might, if they come in confidence of it, and not of the Lords ſtrength, Beſides, Satan, knowing that their fall will proue a diſcouragement to others, will make the greateſt aſſaults againſt them.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 Let Miniſters know that the precepts they giue others,
 belong to themſelues,Miniſters preach to themſelues. which the Apoſtle heere implieth: for though his direction were in the ſecond perſon (be yee ſtrong, put yee on) yet hee layeth downe the motiue in the firſt perſon (we) to ſhew that he was in as great danger as they, that he ſtood in as great need of helpe as they; and that therefore the forenamed directions belonged to him as well as to them.Acts 14. 15. Miniſters are men as well as others, ſubiect to like paſsions as others. If they preach not to themſelues, what means of edification, of direction and incouragemēt belongeth vnto them? Wherfore as people may not imagine that theſe matters of ſpiritual warfare belong only to Miniſters, as if they onely were the Lords ſouldiers, ſo neither may Miniſters put them off from themſelues to the people, as if they were only to look on, &amp; the people to fight; but euery one apply them to themſelues.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 8. Expoſition of words.
                     VVE haue heard of the Defendants: Who are the challengers and aſſaulters? they are ſet downe negatiuely, not fleſh and blood. For this particle not, hath reference to this latter clauſe, as if there were a comma betwixt wreſtle and not, thus, we wreſtle, not with fleſh, &amp;c.
                     By fleſh and blood,
                        Who are fleſh and blood. are here meant ſuch creatures as haue a bodily ſubſtance which conſiſteth of fleſh and blood: in which reſpect man is termedGen. 6. 3. 
                        fleſh, and Chriſt is ſaid to be madeIohn 1. 14. 
                        fleſh, becauſe he had a corporall ſubſtance: herein aLuke 24. 39. difference is made betwixt a Spirit, and a
bodie.
                     
                     Haue we not then any enemies that haue bodily ſubſtances in this ſpirituall combate?Queſt. 1. are ſpirits onely our enemies?
                     
                        Rom. 7. 23, 24. Our owne fleſh is an enemie vnto vs.Anſwere. Other men alſo are enemies: there are many aduerſaries, as infidels, idolaters, heretiques,1 Cor. 16. 9. &amp; 15. 32. worldlings, all ſorts of perſecutors, yea and falſe brethren.
                     Why then is fleſh and blood heere excluded?Queſt. 2.
                     
                     They are not excluded,Anſwer. for this negatiue clauſe is not to be taken ſimply,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . but
                     1 Comparatiuely,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . not ſo much with fleſh and blood as with principalities. With theſe eſpecially wee wreſtle. Thus the Apoſtle forbiddeth ſeruants toVerſ. 7. ſerue men. Or not onely with fleſh and blood, but alſo with ſpirits: ſo ſaith Chriſt,Luke 14. 12. 
                        call not thy friends to dinner, that is, not them alone, but the poore alſo. Or not with fleſh and blood alone, as it is in it ſelfe, weake and fraile, but ſet on worke, aſſiſted and guided by ſpirits. As if ſome Engliſh ſouldiers were in pay vnder the Turke or Spaniard, againſt whom wee maintaine warre, though they be in battaile againſt vs, yet it might be ſaid, we fight not with Engliſh men.
                     2. By way of expoſition, not with ſuch as are weake, fraile, fooliſh, viſible and mortal, as fleſh and blood, Thus the horſes of the Egyptians are calledIſai. 31. 3. fleſh, that is, weak, oppoſed to Spirit: ſo as this phraſe not fleſh and bloud, implieth
more, or other then fleſh and blood.
                  
                  
                     §. 9. How our ſpirituall enemies exceed fleſh and bloud.
                     
                        OVr moſt mortall enemies are more then fleſh and blood,
                        Doct. 4. more in number,Our enemies more then fleſh and blood. greater in power, craftier in their wiles, of longer continuance, more enuious, malicious, furious, cruell, not ſo open and viſible, but inuiſible, cloſe and ſecret, and in many other reſpects more fearefull and dangerous.
                     1. Among fleſh and bloud, none ſo mightie but may be confronted: asDan. 7. 3. &amp;c.
                         
                        Daniels viſions of the beaſts ſheweth. The great Monarchs of the world haue bin deſtroyed one of another, but no fleſh &amp; blood can confront the Diuell.
                     2. Among fleſh and blood none ſo politike, but they meete with ſome that at length match, yea and out-reach them. Achitophel
                        2 Sam. 16. 23 whoſe counſell was counted as an oracle,
&amp; 17. 14. was ouer-matched by Huſhai: But all the wit of all the world cannot match the ſubtiltie of the Diuell.
                     3. Suppoſe that among fleſh and blood ſome bee ſo mightie, as none mightier then they, ſo ſubtill as none can goe beyond them, yet are they flexible, and may by faire means be perſwaded and intreated to allay their furie, as1 Sam. 25. 33 
                        Dauid by wiſe Abigail; yea, &amp; wicked&amp; 24. 17. 
                        Saul by Dauids humbling of himſelfe, &amp; pleading his innocency: but there is no ſuch flexibility in the Diuel, his malice wil not ſuffer him to be moued, vnleſſe for greater aduantage.
                     4. Grant that ſome among men were implacable, yet their fury might bee auoided by flying from them, as
1 Sam. 21. 10 
                        Dauid auoided Sauls furie,1 Kings 19. 3 
                        Eliah Iezabels,
                        Matth. 2. 14. 
                        Ioſeph and
Mary, Herods: From the Diuels we cannot flye, they are euery where, they can ſoone ouertake vs.
                     5. But what if no meanes of eſcape could bee gotten, but that needs we muſt be ſubiect to the rage of fleſh and blood, yet in their greateſt pride, power and rage, they may be cleane taken away by death, asExod. 14. 28. &amp;c. 
                        Pharaoh and his hoſt were drowned:Mat. 2. 20. 
                        Herod the great died, andActs 12. 23. the other
Herod who perſecuted the Apoſtles: but our ſpirituall enemies are not ſubiect to death. I might in many other reſpects make compariſon betwixt fleſh and blood on the one ſide, and Spirits on the other, and ſhew how there is no compariſon betwixt them, that theſe are not fleſh and blood, but much more fearefull.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 This doth much aggrauate the terror of our ſpirituall enemies:
 for ifProu. 19. 12. 
                        the wrath of a King (a King that is but fleſh and blood) be like the roaring of a Lion:
                        Spirituall enemies are terrible. if a man mightie in his owne ſtrength, as1 Sam. 17. 11. 
                        Goltah, be fearefull: if a ſubtill man, as2 Sam. 15 31. 
                        Achitophel, cauſe doubt and dread: if a malicious man, as1 Sam. 22. 9.

 or to auoid their aſſaults:No outward proweſſe can daunt them. it is not outward proweſſe and courage, not ſtrength of body, dint of ſword, troopes of armed men, it is not ſtate-policie, or war-like ſubtiltie that can annoy them, or keepe vs ſafe from them. To oppoſe wit or power of fleſh and blood againſt ſuch as are not fleſh and blood, is to ſet drye ſtraw againſt flaming fire.
2 Cor. 10. 4. 
                        The weapons of our warfare muſt not be carnall, but ſpirituall, and ſo mightie towards God, to keepe vs ſafe from theſe enemies. For ſeeing our enemies are not fleſh and blood,
                         in vaine is ſuch armour as can protect vs onely from fleſh and blood.

Fleſh and blood is but Satans inſtrument, he is the Generall, he the Captaine, he ſetteth fleſh and blood on worke, he aſſiſteth fleſh and blood, ſo as he is the author and finiſher of the euil which they doe: they being but his vaſſals, though they ſeeke to annoy vs; yet wee wreſtle not with them, but with an higher power.
Gen. 3. 1. When the Serpent tempted Euah, ſhee had to doe with the Diuell; and therefore theJohn 8. 44. Diuell is ſaid to be a murtherer from the beginning. The Sabeans and Chaldeans robbed Iob, yetJob. 1. 12. is the deed attributed to Satan. Though a mayde and a man brought Peter to deny his Maſter, yet thereinLuke 22. 31. Satan winowed him.Mat. 16. 23. Chriſt ſaith to Peter who tempted him, Goe behind me Satan. The perſecuting Iewes hindred Paul from comming to the Theſſalonians, yet he ſaith1. Theſ. 2. 18.

Therefore the Apoſtle dehorting vs from anger ſaith,Epheſ. 4. 27. 
                        Giue no place to the Diuell. When couetouſneſſe moued Ananias

                        Why hath Satan filled thine heart? When pride mooued Dauid to number the people, it is ſaid1 Chr. 21. 1. 
                        Satan prouoked him: for as the ſpirit of God ſtirreth vs vp to euery good thing, ſo the ſpirit of the Diuell ſuggeſteth vnto vs euery euill thing.

 In all combates whether againſt our owne corruptions,Fight principally againſt the Diuell. or againſt euill men, as perſecutors, ſeducers, and the like, ſtriue to driue the Diuell away, and that by ſpirituall armour;1 Kings 22. 31. yea, pray to God to rebuke him. Aſſuredly fleſh and blood cannot much annoy vs, if Satan be reſiſted and withſtood. Obſerue in all hiſtories of all ages, the records of battels, and yee ſhall finde that if the Generals and Captaines haue beene conquered, the common ſouldiers haue ſoone yeelded, or beene put to flight.
                     It is the Diuell which bloweth vp in vs the fire of luſt, pride, couetouſneſſe, and all other vices: he layeth before vs euill baits, agreeable to our nature, and ſo ſeduceth vs: he inrageth perſecutors, hee blindeth idolaters, he ſeduceth heretikes, &amp;c. If this were well weighed it would make vs pitie fleſh and blood when it fighteth againſt vs, rather then enuie it: it would keepe vs from ſnarling like a dogge at the ſtone which is flong.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 I might heere lay forth the wretched eſtate of all that fight againſt Chriſtians,
 and ſhew how they fight vnder Satans colours, and ſhall receiue their wages of him,

                     §. 11. Who cannot ſtand againſt fleſh and blood, can much leſſe ſtand againſt principalities and powers.
                     THe affirmatiue part of the deſcription of our aſſaulters followeth, which is ioyned to the other part with an aduerſatiue particle but:
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . not with fleſh and blood, but with principalities: whereby is further confirmed that which we haueDoct 4. before proued, and ſhall yet more euidently be demonſtrated in handling the particular branches of this deſcription,Doct. 6. that our enemies, with whom wee are to wreſtle, are much more terrible then fleſh and blood. I will not ſtand to prooue the Doctrine againe in this place, onely heere obſerue one vſe.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 They who are qualed with that which fleſh and blood can doe,
 can neuer be able to ſtand againſt theſe ſpirituall enemies.Who are qualed by fleſh and blood cannot ſtand againſt principallities. He that is terrified with the barking of a little whelpe, will be much more with the roaring of a Lion: he that in faith cannot ſay,Pſal. 118. 6. 
                        I will not feare what man can doe, can neuer ſay, I will not feare what Principalities can doe. Let this be noted of thoſe who are turned out of the wayes of righteouſneſſe, and made to flie by mans threatnings, reprochings, and euill intreatings, let them neuer looke to ouercome and reigne with Chriſt. The Sabeans, Chaldeans, and all that fleſh and blood could do, preuailed not againſt Iob. Wherefore when fleſh and blood maketh any aſſault, let vs thus reaſon with ourſelues, There are ſorer enemies then theſe, with whom we muſt wreſtle: if we ſhrinke from theſe, how ſhall we ſtand againſt them? Let the conſideration hereof make vs the more bold and confident againſt all that fleſh and blood can doe.
                  
                  
                     §. 12. Expoſition of words.
                     NOw conſider we the particular branches of this deſcription of our enemies. There are foure diſtinct branches diſtinguiſhed by this particle against.
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Much ambiguitie and obſcuritie is in this deſcription. I will therefore as plainely as I can cleare the meaning of the words.
                     
                         From theſe ſeuerall branches many collect diuers and diſtinct orders of Diuells, one ſubordinate to another: as among men there be diuers orders, ſome Kings, ſome Dukes, Earles, Barons, &amp;c. Thus they make the Diuell, mentionedVerſ. 11. before, the head and Monarch of all the reſt: Principallities vnder him: powers vnder them, and ſo in the reſt. For my part, I thinke theſe diſtinctions in this place ouer-curious: I deny not an order to be amongſt Diuels, euen as amongſt theeues, pirats, connycatchers, &amp;c. There is an head andMat. 9. 34. 
                        Prince of them. For mention is made of theMat. 25. 41. 
                        Diuell and his angels. There may bee alſo diſtinct and ſeuerall offices among them (as among the forenamed pirats) as ſome to tempt, ſome to accuſe, ſome to execute vengeance, &amp;c. For if all ſhould doe the ſame thing, how ſhould the other things bee done? but that certaine bee alwayes tyed to one place, perſon and function, is both vncertaine and vnlikely. Further, that heere in this place there ſhould be ſo many orders and ranckes of Diuels, as are diſtinct branches, is alſo vncertaine; neither can any ſuch thing by any iuſt conſequence be collected.
                     I rather take theſe titles to bee vſed by the Apoſtle, to ſet forth their conditions and effects.
                     The firſt title is Principallities, or gouernments: ſo termed, becauſe they haue great rule, power, and dominion, not ſo much ouer other Diuells, as ouer wicked men.
                     The ſecond is powers, to ſhew that their principallitie is not a meere titular matter, but is armeed with power, ſo as with their powerfull gouernment, they are able to doe great matters.
                     Theſe two titles, principallities and powers, areIn abſtracto. thus ſet downe, rather thenIn concreto. powerfull gouernours, to amplifie both the one, and the other.
                     
                         The third is worldly Gouernors. This I take to be added as an expoſition of the firſt, or rather as a limitation thereof, ſhewing ouer whom the Diuels are gouernours: not ouer the choſen and called of God; but ouer the world (ForJohn 17. 9. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Chriſt maketh a direct oppoſition betwixt theſe:) therefore the Apoſtle vſeth a compound word, which expreſſeth not onely their gouernement, but alſo their ſubiects.
                     But theIohn 3. 16. elect alſo are counted to be of the world while heere they liue,Obiect. becauſe in the world they were bred, brought forth, brought vp, and ended their dayes.
                     They are in the world,Anſwer. but not of the world,Ioh. 17. 6, 16. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . after that they are effectually called: therefore for more perſpi
                           •
                        uitie ſake, the Apoſtle addeth this clauſe, of the darkeneſſe of this world, whereby particularly he ſheweth whom the Diuels gouerne in this world; namely; ſuch as are
darkneſſe: here againe for emphaſis ſake, he rather vſeth this wordIn abſtracto. 
                        darkneſſe thenIn concreto. 
                        darke: and hee vnderſtandeth the darkneſſe of ignorance and wickedneſſe: ſo that in plaine termes they are the ignorant and wicked men of the world, ouer whom the Diuels reigne.
                     The fourth is ſpirituall wickedneſſe. This declareth their nature, that they are ſpirits, and their condition, that they are euill, and malicious. The phraſe which the Apoſtle vſeth is ſomewhat ſtrange, word for word it is this,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        Spirituals of wickedneſſe, or ſpirits of wickedneſſe, that is, moſt monſtrous wicked ſpirits.
                     Laſtly, is added a phraſe ſomewhat ambiguous, becauſe that whereunto it hath reference, is not expreſſed: it is this, word for word,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        in heauenlies. Heere ſome to make vp the ſence adde places, whereby is implied that theſe euill ſpirits are ouer vs in the ayre: for there are three places in Scripture termed Heauen.Mat. 6. 26. Firſt the ayre where fowles are.Gen. 22. 17. Secondly, the firmament where the 
                           •
                        tarres are. Thirdly, that place of glory, which is called Gods Throne,Matth. 6. 9. where Chriſt in his body, and the ſoules of the iuſt and perfect men departed are. This is called the third Heauen,2. Cor. 12. 2. the higheſt Heauen.
                     Now if the place of ſpirits be heere meant, by heauenly places muſt needs be meant the ayre, which is the loweſt heauen: forReu. 12. 8, 9, 10, &amp; 21. 27. out of the higheſt heauen they are excluded. Other adde things, whereby is implied the cauſe of this combate, which is not any light, fading earthly traſh, but heauenly and ſpirituall treaſure. Of the difference of theſe expoſitions, I ſhall ſpeake more fully, when I come more diſtinctly to handle this clauſe.
                     Of theſe foure fore-named branches; two, namely the firſt and the third doe in the generall ſcope ſet foorth one and the ſame point; namely the dominion of the Diuels▪ the fourth containeth three diſtinct points. Firſt, the nature of Diuels. Secondly, their qualitie. Thirdly, the place, or cauſe of the combate.
                     Our enemies then are in this affirmatiue part deſcribed by fiue arguments; 1. Their gouernment: 2 Their power: 3. Their nature: 4. Their qualitie: 5. Their place of abode, or cauſe of fight.
                  
                  
                     §. 13. Of Satans dominion.

                              •

                        Quest. How came the Diuels to haue a regiment? is their gouernment from God? ordained of him?
                     
                        Anſw. I may to this queſtion in ſome ſort apply the anſwere which Chriſt gaue to Pilat,
                        John 19. 11. they could haue no power at all,Reaſon 1. except it were giuen them from aboue. So that their dominion is by Gods permiſſion,Gods permiſſion. who in iuſt iudgement for2 Theſ. 2. 11. puniſhment of the wicked, hath giuen libertie to the Diuel to exerciſe iuriſdiction ouer them. For asDeut. 28 48. God gaue the rebellious Iſraelites into the power of cruell tyrants and vſurpers,Judges 3. 8. ſo hee giueth the world into the power of the Diuell.
                     Yet haue they no true right and title to their gouernment, as if it were properly deputed vnto them of God, as the gouernment of lawfull Kings and Magiſtrates on earth is. For as the Kings of forraine Nations which inuaded
Iſrael, and for a while ruled ouer them, were but oppreſſors and vſurpers, (thoughEſay 10. 5. God in iuſtice made them a rod to puniſh the people) and thereforeIudges 3. 9. when
Iſrael repented, the Lord deliuered them, and caſt the rodde into the fire: ſo the Diuels. Other reaſons therefore there bee of the Diuels dominion, and that partly in regard of themſelues, and partly in regard of their vaſſals.
                     For themſelues they haue vſurped dominion,
                           Reaſon 2. Satans vſurpation. they haue by tyrannie taken principallitie vnto themſelues, euen as one of their chiefeſt inſtruments on earth haue done (I meane that man of ſinne,2 Theſ. 2. 4. 
                        Who exalteth himſelfe aboue all that is called god, or worſhipped, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God, euen that Whore of Babylon, whoReu. 18. 7. 
                        glorified her ſelfe.) Thus haue theſe Principallities heere ſpoken of, exalted and glorified themſelues. In regard of this ambitious tyrannicall vſurpation; the Diuell hauing ſhewed Chriſt all the Kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them, ſaidLuke 4. 6. 
                        This is deliuered to me, and to whomſoeuer I will, I giue it.
                     
                     For the Diuels vaſſals (which are all the wicked of the world) they ſlauiſhly and willingly yeeld themſelues to his gouernment and tyrannie,Reaſon 2. making themſelues ſubiect to theſe principallities,
                        Mans ſubiection. whereby the rather theſe Diuels haue taken dominion ouer them:Iudges 9. 6. as the men of Shechem ſubiecting themſelues to Abimelech, hee became their King:2 Sam. 15. 13 as the hearts of Iſrael turned after Abſolom, and he became their King: and1 King. 12. 20. after that to Ieroboam, and hee became their King; and to many others who became their Kings: in which reſpect God ſaid,Hoſ. 8. 4. 
                        They haue ſet vp a King, but not by me; they haue made Princes, and I knew it not. That the wicked doe willingly and ſlauiſhly ſubiect themſelues to the Diuell is without queſtion: for it is writtenReu. 13. 4. 
                        The whole world worſhipped the Dragon which is the Diuell.

 or yeeld vnto him any whit at all. Where hee getteth any entrance,Giue no place to the Diuell. there will he ſet his throne, asIer. 43. 10. 
                        Nebuchadnezzar did; he is exceeding ambitious, and tyrannicall: hee will be a King, or no body: if he get an inch, hee will take an ell: if any make themſelues in any thing ſubiect vnto him, he will ſoone take a principallitie ouer them. Now cōſider in how woful an eſtate they liue, who haue earthly I yrants to rule ouer them, &amp; withall conſider how far the Diuell exceedeth all the Tyrants of this world in malice and miſchiefe, and from thence gather in what miſery they lie, who are vnder the principallity of Satan.

 who thinke that the Diuell is their ſeruant,His ſeruice is to rule. at their command, which is the conceit of Witches, Coniurers, Sorcerers and the like, yea alſo of many prophane and wicked worldlings. Indeed he may, and doth often pretend and make ſhew of ſeruice, but it is like the ſeruice of him who ſtileth himſelfe,Dominus Papa▪ ſervus ſeruorum.

                        Wee will not haue this man to reigne ouer vs:
                        Pſal. 2. 3. 
                        Let vs breake his bands, and cast his cords from vs; then in iuſt iudgement will Chriſt giue vs ouer to the tyrannie of Satan For there is no middle monarchie or regiment betwixt theſe: whoſoeuer are not Chriſts ſubiects, are Satans vaſſals.Reuel. 13. 8. 
                        All that dwell on the earth ſhall worſhip the Diuell, whoſe names are not written in the booke of life. Note what was threatened againſt Iſrael,

                        Becauſe thou ſeruedst not the Lord thy God, &amp;c. Therefore thou ſhalt ſerue thine enemies, &amp;c. This will bee iuſt with the Lord to giue them ouer to Satans power, who rebell againſt him; that ſo by their hard bondage vnder him, they might the better ſee their folly, and if they haue ſo much grace, bewaile it, and become wiſer.

                     THe ſecond argument whereby the Diuels are deſcribed, is their power: this ſheweth, that

                           . a power whereby they are able to keepe their vaſſals and captiues vnder them in ſubiection. In this reſpect Satan is calledChap 2 v. 2. 
                        a Prince of power. Many titles in Scripture giuen vnto him doe argue as much, asLuk. 11. 21.

Iob, and it will appeare that hee is indeed a Prince of power.
                     The Lord ſuffereth him to bee a Prince of ſuch power,Reaſons.
                     
                     1 That his owne diuine power might bee the more manifeſted, in ſubduing ſuch a powerfull Prince.
                     2 That there might be made a greater triall of the courage of his Saints and children. Thus was Iobs courage and ſtrength manifeſted.
                     3 That hee might execute the ſorer vengeance vpon the wicked.
                     This generall point, that the Diuell is a powerfull and mighty Prince, being thus cleared, for the better vnderſtanding of Satans power; I will as plainely as I can reſolue their particular queſtions.
                     1 Whether the Diuels bee able to doe what they will?
                     2 If not what they will, then whether they be able to doe any thing aboue the courſe of nature?
                     3 If not aboue nature, wherein conſiſteth their extraordinary power?
                     4 Whether their power bee any whit leſſened ſince their fall?
                     5 Whether they haue alwaies liberty to doe what they are able?
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 15. Of the reſtraint of Satans power.
                     1 FOr the firſt,The Diuell cannot doe what he will. The Diuell is not able to do whatſoeuer he will; for this is proper onely to God, whoſe power is infinite. Were hee able to doe what hee would, God ſhould haue no command of him, no power ouer him: but hee himſelfe is a creature, his power is a created power: and therefore limited within the bounds of a creature.
                     2 For the ſecond,Nor doe any thing againſt nature. He is not able to doe any thing ſimply aboue, or directly againſt that courſe which the Lord hath ordained vnto his creatures, which is commonly called, the courſe of nature. For God hath tied all his creatures thereunto; and hath reſerued onely vnto himſelfe, who is the ſole Lord of nature, power to alter it as pleaſeth him. Which being ſo, by neceſſary conſequence, it followeth that the Diuell, 1. Cannot worke miracles, 2. Nor force the will of man, 3. Nor know the ſecrets of mans heart, 4. Nor foretell things to come: for all theſe are eyther aboue, or againſt the courſe of nature.
                  
                  
                     §. 16. Of Satans power in miracles.
                     1 COncerning miracles,
                        Nor worke miracles. the Diuell cannot worke any. For Chriſt by the miracles which hee wrought, manifeſted himſelfe to be the Son of God, indued with diuine power. The Prophets and Apoſtles were declared to bee the ſeruants God, and aſſiſted with diuine power; yea God was manifeſted to worke in and by them, by the miracles which they wrought. If the Diuell had power to worke miracles, miracles had not been ſo euident a demonſtration of the power of God. The very Sorcerers could ſay of the miracles which were wrought by the miniſtery of Moſes,
                        Exod. 8. 19. 
                        This is the finger of God.
                     
                     
                        Obiect. Thoſe Sorcer
                           •
                        rs wrought ſome of the miracles which Moſes did.
                     
                        Anſ.
                        The workes done by the Sorcerers in Egypt were counterfeit. Though there were ſome outward likeneſſe and reſemblance betwixt ſome of thoſe things which Moſes and the Sorcerers did, as turning rods into Serpents, water into blood, and bringing abundance of frogs; yet in truth there was a very great and maine difference betwixt them. There is no doubt but the things which Moſes did, were truly and properly miracles: as for the things which the Sorcerers did, either they might be done by naturall meanes, as the Diuell might ſecretly conueigh Serpents, and blood, and frogs from other places to Egypt: or elſe the things which they did might be meere illuſions, onely appearances of things which were not ſo: and ſo the Egyptians made to thinke they ſaw Serpents, blood, and frogs, when in truth there were no ſuch things: this latter is the more likely, as may be gathered by the circumſtances noted in thoſe hiſtories. Firſt for the Serpents, it is ſaid thatExod. 7. 12. 
                        Aarons rod deuoured their rods: Euident therefore it is, that Aarons rod was turned into a true liuing Serpent, and likely that the Sorcerers roddes were not ſo, becauſe they made no reſiſtance, but were deuoured.
                     2 For the waters, it is noted, thatExod. 7. 20. 24. 25. 
                        all the water that was in their riuer was turned into blood, and ſo continued ſeuen dayes, and that they could not drinke of that water. But no ſuch thing written of the waters which the Sorcerers ſeemed to turne into blood; neither is it likely theſe waters were ſo: for the waters which they ſeemed to turne muſt needs be in Goſhen, (which was free from all the plagues) in Egypt all was blood.
                     
                         3 For the frogges, thoſe which Moſes broughtExod. 8. 14. 
                        were gathered on heapes, and made the Land ſtinke. But what became of thoſe which the Sorcerers brought?
                     
                        Obiection. Why then went they no further? could they not as eaſily haue made ſhew of lice?
                     
                        Anſwer. God would not ſuffer them any longer to delude the Aegyptians.
                     Fitly may I apply that2 Theſ. 2. 9. title which the holy Ghoſt attributeth to the pretended miracles of Antichriſt, vnto all the pretended miracles of Satan, and call them lying wonders.

All at all times yeeld not vnto him. If hee could force the will, hee would draw all to his bent.

                        Obiect. Satan and his inſtruments haue foretold many things to come,1 Sam. 28. 19 as when hee appeared to Saul; andActs 16. 16. the diuining Mayde; yeaDeut. 13. 1, 2 God implieth that they may.
                     
                        Anſw. Such things they may foretell, as by naturall cauſes or ſignes may bee collected, or coniectured: or which by God haue any way beene reuealed. The Diuell is admirably and extraordinarily skilfull, and experienced in all the cauſes of nature, and can draw one conſequence vpon another:Simil. As if one linck of a long chaine being in a deepe well, appeare but a little aboue water, by it he can draw vp linck after linck, and ſo at length the bucket it ſelfe out of the water, which otherwiſe could not haue bin ſeene. Alſo he diligently marketh all the ſecrets which God reuealeth, euen ſo ſoone as they are reuealed, and ſo may ſeeme to foretell of himſelfe inch things as God foretold. There was very great probabilitie of that which the Diuell told to Saul: the things which the diuining Maide &amp; ſuch other foretold, might be ſuch as were gathered by ſome vnknowne natural cauſes. That which God implieth of falſe Prophets, may be meant of meere coniectures, or of ſome ſuch inſtances as are heere named.

                     3 FOr the third,Wherein Satans extraordinary power conſiſteth. the extraordinary power of the Diuel conſiſteth in this, that he can do any thing whatſoeuer is in the compaſſe of nature, and may be effected by naturall meanes. For example,Iob 1. 16. 19. he can violently moue the ayre, and cauſe tempeſts and ſtormes:Ibid. he can inflame the ayre, and cauſe thunder and lightning; yea, and extraordinary fire to fall downe: he can exceedingly trouble the Seas, and cauſe ſuch waues and billowes to ariſe, as ſhall ſwallow vp ſhips and men: he can cauſe waters to ſwell ouer the bancks, and ſo make great breaches. On earth he can cauſe earth-quakes, he can throw downe the ſtrongeſt buildings, and roote vp the beſt ſetled trees, and mooue all things: hee can carry and hurry vp and downe euen in the ayreMat 4. 5. 8. the bodies of men and beaſtes: yea,Mat. 8. 32. hee can enter into them, and make them with violence ruſh and runne headlong hither and thither:Mat. 17. 15. hee can caſt them into the fire and water,Mat. 15. 22 grieuouſly vexe and torment them, andIob 2. 7. inflict ſore diſeaſes vpon them; he canMarke 9. 17, &amp;c. poſſeſſe them, make them lunatick, dumb, deafe, blinde; make them foame and roare out, and all to rent them; he can ſtirre vpEpheſ. 4. 27. wrath, pride, couetouſneſſe, luſt, and the like paſſions in men; he can know the diſpoſition of men, and accordingly lay baites for them, or bring them vnto baits; hee can2. Cor. 4. 4. darken mens vnderſtanding, andMat. 27. 3, &amp;c. cauſe much trouble and anguiſh in their ſoule and conſcience; yea, ſo much as they cannot endure it, but are brought to make away themſelues; hee can incenſe man againſt man, Kingdome againſt Kingdome, Subiects againſt Princes, Princes againſt ſubiects, and ſo cauſe quarrels, warres, treaſons rebellions, oppreſſions, murthers, &amp;c. Many more ſtrange miſchiefes can he worke, which for kinde are extraordinarily wonderfull, and for number innumerable.

But in compariſon to other creatures, they ſtill retaine ſo much power ouer them, as their power cannot appeare to bee any whit diminiſhed by their fall: but that ſtill they remaine to be as powerfull to doe miſchiefe, as they were before to doe good: for all other creatures (except the good Angels) are not able to withſtand their might and fury.

                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        a libertie to doe as one liſt, yet it may not, nor cannot be denied, that that power which is giuen them is ſo limited and reſtrained by an higher and ſuperiour power, euen the power of God, that they cannot as they liſt themſelues exerciſe the vttermoſt of their power, and doe what they are able to doe, if they were not held in. Fitly may I apply that to the Diuell, which is ſaid of the Sea,Job. 38. 10, 11. that God hath ſet barres and doores before him, and ſaid, Hither to ſhall hee come, and no further. In this reſpect they are ſaid2. Pet. 2. 4. 
                        to bee deliuered into chains, and
                        Iude verſ. 6. 
                        reſerued in euerlaſting chaines: By which phraſes is implied that the Lord dealeth with Diuels,Simil. as men vſe to doe with curſt madde ban-dogges, which will flye at the throate of euery one with whom they meete, they tye and chaine them vp for feare of doing hurt. For proofe hereof, note what God ſaid to the Diuell vnder the Serpent, e 
                        Thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele: by which phraſe is implied a reſtraint, namely, that he ſhould not come ſo high as the Saints head to cruſh it, he ſhould onely ſnarle at his heele, and bite it; that is, he ſhould not bee able vtterly to deſtroy their ſoules, but onely annoy them with ſmaller temptations.
                     But more cleerely is this laid downe by many particular inſtances.Exod. 8. 18. Satans power in the Sorcerers of Egypt was reſtrained; the1. Sam. 16. 14 euill ſpirit could not enter into Saul, till God permitted him: for it is ſaid, God ſent him.1 Kings▪ 22. 22. The like is noted of the lying ſpirit that ſeduced Ahab.
                        Zach. 3. 1, 2. Satan ſtood at Iehoſhuahs right hand to reſiſt him, but the Lord reproued him.Luke 22. 31, 32. He deſired to wi
                           •
                        ow Peter, and the other Apoſtles, (ſo as without leaue he could not doe it) and yet he preuailed not as he deſired. Many other particular inſtances might be alledged; but the moſt famous of all is that which is noted in the hiſtory of Iob,
                        Job 1. 11, 12 &amp; 2. 5, 6. where hee could doe nothing againſt Iob till hee had leaue, and when he had leaue, he could doe no more then was permitted. Laſtly, as an argument from the leſſe to the greater, and ſo a more forceable argument, noteMat. 8. 31. how hee could not enter into ſwine without permiſſion; much leſſe can be doe any thing againſt man without leaue.Mat. 6. 26. 
                        Are not men much better then ſwine?
                     
                     
                        Obiect. But nowReu. 20. 7. Satan is looſed, and hath libertie to doe what he can.
                     
                        Anſw. That is ſpoken comparatiuely, in regard of former reſtraint:Simil. as when a dogge hath ſometime beene tied very cloſe, and afterwards his chaine is let out further, he may be ſaid to be looſed.
                     The Lord thus limiteth his power,
                           Reaſons. Why God reſtraineth Satans power. both in regard of himſelfe, and alſo in regard of man, who is made after Gods Image.
                     For himſelfe: 1. That hee might manifeſt a difference betwixt his owne power, which is infinite, without limits and bounds; and the power of his enemies who oppoſe themſelues againſt him. Therefore is his power calledVerſe 10. 
                        a power of might, as if no other power were mightie but his. 2. That hee might ſhew himſelfe to bee an abſolute Lord and Commander ouer all creatures, not only thoſe who voluntarily ſubiect themſelues to him, but alſo thoſeMarke 1. 27 who obſtinately oppoſe againſt him.
                     For man, left the Diuell ſhould ſoone deuour all mankinde, for that hee1. Pet. 5. 8. ſeeketh. If hee were not reſtrained, no creature could reſiſt him, and ſtand before him. As the Sea,Simil. if it had not bounds, would ſoone ouerwhelme the whole world, ſo would the Diuell ſoone turne all topſie turuie, quickely deſtroy all liuing creatures, and bring all to the very depth of hell, where himſelfe is. Therefore though the Lord for iuſt reaſons hath giuen him a very great and mightie power, yet in wiſdome and goodneſſe hath hee alſo reſtrained his power, and ſet bounds vnto it:
                     Thus wee haue heard of the extent, and of the reſtraint of the Diuels power, both which are well to bee noted.
                     The one,Vſes. that we ſhould not make too light account of him.Make not a tuſh at Satan. The other, that wee ſhould not dread him too much.
                     Is the Diuell a Prince of ſuch power? Bee neither arrogant nor ſecure; but know that all the meanes which wee can vſe, are little enough to keepe vs ſafe from him. Yea,

                     Wicked perſons beleeue not that the Diuell is ſo cruell a tyrant as he is reported to be: They thinke him to bee the beſt Lord, becauſe he ſuffereth them to doe as they liſt, and his temptations are agreeable to their corrupt humours and carnall deſires: they take moſt delight in doing the worke of the Diuell; yea, as ChriſtIohn 8. 44. ſaith, they
will doe the luſts of their father the Diuell.
                        Virtus Diaboli eſt quod homnes mali ſunt. Chryſ. in Mat. 22. hom. 42. Is it then any maruell that the Diuell is their gouernour?
                     Neither ignorant nor wicked perſons will ſubiect themſelues to the Lords gouernement:
                           Reaſon 2. They are not ſubiect to Chriſt. not ignorant, becauſe they know not the benefit of it: not wicked, becauſe they thinke it too ſtrait, too much croſſing their licentious humor. Therefore in iuſtice God giueth them ouer to the rule of the Diuell.
                     Hereby may triall be made whether wee be vnder the rule and power of the Diuell or no.
                           Vſe 1. Trial if vnder Satans power or no.
                        John 3. 19. If we loue darkneſſe more then light, if weChap. 5 v. 11. haue fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkeneſſe, wee are in the power of the Prince of darkeneſſe. Hearken to this O ignorant perſons, ye that are neglecters and deſpiſers of the light of Gods Word, that cry out againſt ſo much preaching: if at leaſt your eares be better then your eyes, and you can beleeue that which by others is declared vnto you. Hearken to this alſo, O ye wicked perſons, who purſue ſo eagerly the euill deſires of your hearts, and the fooliſh cuſtomes of the vaine World▪ if at leaſt your euill hearts will let you yeeld to any thing that may turne to your good. Oh, if it were poſſible, for theſe two ſorts of perſons, to ſee in what a miſerable plight they are by thoſe gouernours vnder whom they liue, then would the ignorant learne knowledge, and ſinners enter into a new courſe. Fondly they think they liue in great libertie, wheras in truth, they liue in moſt ſlauiſh bondage. I may iuſtly in this caſe take vp the complaint of Wiſdome, and ſay,Prou 1. 22. 
                        O yee fooliſh, how long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe, &amp;c.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 Hereby alſo men may learne how to come out of Satans power;
 namely,Acts 26. 18. by comming out of darkneſſe into light.How a man may come out of Satans power. So long as we liue and lye in darkneſſe, there is no hope, no poſſibilitie of freeing our ſelues from the tyrannie of Satan.Col. 1. 13. God firſt deliuereth vs from the power of darkneſſe, and then tranſlateth vs into the Kingdome of his Sonne.
                     This vſe affoordeth a good direction to Magiſtrates, to Miniſters, to all that haue charge of others, and to priuate perſons.
                     To Magiſtrates, that they take order to eſtabliſh the Miniſterie of the Word in ſuch places as are vnder their rule.
                     To Miniſters, that they be diligent and faithfull in preaching it.
                     To all that haue charge, that they bring ſuch as are vnder them to the Word.
                     To priuate perſons, that they be willing to heare, and carefull to practiſe what they heare.
                     Note what Chriſt ſaith of the iſſue and power of the Word preached by his Diſciples,Luke 10. 18. 
                        Hee ſaw Satan fall downe like lightning: for by it mens minds are inlightned, and their hearts conuerted, ſo as Satan cannot beare ſuch ſway ouer them, as hee doth ouer ignorant and wicked perſons▪
                     
                     That which is in generall ſaid of freeing men from the tyrannie of Satan, may particularly bee applied to thoſe who are in bondage vnder his great Vice-roy on earth,How Papiſts may be abandoned. euen Antichriſt, which deceiueth the greateſt part of the world. His kingdome is a kingdome of darkneſſe: where the light of the Goſpell ſhineth forth, the clouds and miſtes of that darkeneſſe vaniſh away. Experience ſheweth, that where the preaching of the Word is rare, there is greateſt number of Antichriſts vaſſals. God grant this may be duely conſidered by them, who for the ſafety of the Kingdome, and the furtherance of Religion, doe treate of meanes whereby the number of Papiſts may be diminiſhed.
                     For our ſelues, let vs firſt labour for the light of knowledge to inlighten vs, and then for the light of grace to renew vs; ſo ſhall we be freed from the kingdome of darkeneſſe. For the attaining hereunto, we muſt diligently attend to the light of Gods word, and alſo pray for the

                        ſpirituall things, ſo that
                     
                        The enemies of our ſoules are of a ſpirituall ſubſtance.
                        
                           Doct. 11. Our enemies are ſpirits. Oft in Scripture are they expreſly called ſpirits, and that both in the old and new Teſtament.
                     They were created ſpirits, and ſpirits they ſtill remaine to be. Their fall hath not altered their ſubſtance: for then could not that nature and ſubſtance which tranſgreſſed be puniſhed.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 Groſly doe they erre in the nature of Diuels,
 who thinke,Diuels are not qualities. and teach that they be nothing but bad qualities and euill affections, which ariſe from our fleſh. The Apoſtle expreſly denieth them to be fleſh, and implieth that they are much more then fleſh: how then ſhould they be thought to bee affections ariſing from the fleſh? If becauſe they are ſpirituall things they ſhould be no ſubſtances, but onely qualities, then neither ſhould theEccleſ. 12. 7. ſoules of men,Heb. 5. 14. nor good Angels, norIohn 4. 14. God himſelfe be a ſubſtance: for all theſe in Scripture are termed Spirits. But ſpirituall things may be as truly and properly ſubſtances as bodily things, if not more: it is not any outward property of a body that ſimply maketh a ſubſtance: Things may be ſenſible, and yet be no ſubſtances, as colours, ſounds, ſmels, &amp;c. But for the Diuels, the actions which they performe, the places where they abide, and from whence they goe vp and downe, the power wherewith they are indued, the torments and paines which they endure, with many other like arguments, which out of the Scripture may be collected concerning them, euidently ſhew that they are truly and properly ſubſtances. The contrary opinion, as it is erronious, ſo it is very dangerous, in that it doth much extenuate thoſe fearefull things which haue beene deliuered concerning Diuels, yea, it maketh them to be but fables. Therefore this error is ſo much the rather to be taken heede of.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 26 Of the aduantage which Satan hath.
                     THe ſpirituall nature of Diuels doth many waies aggrauate their terror.Vſe 2. Spirits very terrible. For they being ſpirits,Spirits very terrible. it followeth that they are
                     1 Inuiſible: though they ſee vs in euery place, and on euery ſide within and without, yet they cannot be ſeene of vs. And as their nature is, ſo are their aſſaults, ſuch as by the eyes of fleſh and blood cannot be ſeene. Conſider what aduantage one that ſeeth hath againſt a blind man.
Gen. 19. 9. 11 The Sodomites who ſo fiercely aſſaulted Lots houſe, being ſtrucken with blindneſſe could doe no hurt.2 Kin. 6. 19. 
                        Eliſha himſelfe alone led an Army of his enemies (being made blinde) whither he liſt. We to ſpirits are as blinde men: we can neither ſee them, nor their aſſaults. I ſpeake of men as they are fleſh and blood, naturall men. God giueth to them that are borne of the Spirit, ſpirituall eyes to diſcerne them and auoide them.
                     2 Priuy to whatſoeuer we doe or ſpeake, whether wee bee in company or alone, in light or in darkeneſſe: ſcarce a thought can paſſe from vs, but they can ſhrewdly geſſe at it: ſoone can they eſpie out all our deuices againſt them.
2 Kin. 6. 11. The King of Aram found it to be a great diſaduantage, that his enemy had one who could diſcloſe the words that he ſpake in his priuy chamber; and his heart was troubled for this thing. What great aduantage haue theſe ſpirituall enemies againſt vs, who are fleſh and blood?
                     3 Not hindered by any bodily impediments: no ſenſible ſubſtance can any whit ſtay their courſe, or ſlacken their enterpriſe; they can either paſſe thorough, or paſſe ouer all ſuch things as would ſtop and hinder vs; as armies of men, ſtone walles, iron gates, woods, waters, yea, Seas, and Oceans, with the like. They need not ſuch ſpace of time to paſſe from place to place, as wee doe; but can on the ſudden be in diuers places, which are many millions of miles aſunder. For they haue no corporall grauity to hinder them, neither can they be let by any bodily obſtacle. The Sunne is not ſwifter then they: the ſight of a mans eye, the lightning from Heauen is not more quicke or ſpeedy.Deut. 28. 49 This alſo is a very great aduantage.

Hence it is, that after they haue done many thouſand great exploits, they are as freſh and ready to doe many more, as they were at firſt. They need no reſting time, but continually night and day are aſſaulting men without intermiſſion, and without ceaſing: ſome comfort it is to them who are ſorely aſſaulted by bodily enemies, that the night commeth on,2 Sam. 2. 14. &amp;c. which vſually cauſeth ſome ſtay. But in the combate with ſpirituall enemies, there is no hope of any ſuch matter. No, they are not ſubiect to death:Gen. 3. 15. from the beginning of the World they haue aſſaulted man; and to the end of the World ſhall they continue: whereby they muſt needs gather much experience, which is a great diſaduantage.
                     I might further proceed in ſetting downe other particular points of aduantage which they haue againſt vs, in this reſpect that they are ſpirituall things. But theſe may ſuffice, and ſurely theſe may bee enough to diſcourage many, and make them ſay;

                        Anſw. Though they be ſpirits, yet God (in the power of whoſe might we are ſtrong) is a Spirit of ſpirits, the higheſt ſpirit, euery way infinite. God is inuiſible euen to them, and they as blind as beetles to God: they cannot know the counſell of God, yet God knoweth all their deuices; God is euery where preſent, much leſſe ſubiect to decay then they. Yea, God giueth to his ſouldiers his Spirit to open their eyes, that they may ſee the Diuels temptations: hee diſcouereth all the purpoſes of the wicked one, andLuk. 11. 22. truſteth him out of his hold: he keepeth vs from fainting: and for our further incouragementPſal. 91. 11. giueth his hoſts of good Angels a charge to guard vs, and keepe vs in all our waies.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 3 This point concerning the ſpirituall nature of our enemies,
 is a ſtrong motiue to vrge thoſe exhortations which we haue heard before of flying to God, and relying vpon his power, and likewiſe of vſing ſpirituall armour.
                  
                  
                     §. 28. Of Satans euill quality.
                     THe fourth argument whereby the Diuels are deſcribed is their quality, which is wickedneſſe.
                     
                     Some reſtraine this to their malice in particular. Their maliceVerſe 11. hath beene in part laide forth by diſcouering their manifold wiles, and ſhall further be declared on the laſt clauſe of this verſe. Here I will ſpeake of their wickedneſſe in generall, for ſo I take the extent of this word in this place.
                     
                        
                        The Diuels are extreamely euill: they are wholly and onely ſet vpon miſchiefe and wickedneſſe:
                           Doct. 12. Diuels extreamely euil. Therefore as by a kind of exaggeration they are here called ſpirits of wickedneſſe, ſo elſewhere Satan is termed by a kind of proprietie
Mat. 13. 19. 
                        that wicked one. Many attributes in Scripture are giuen to them, to ſet forth their wickedneſſe, asMar. 1. 23.

                     1 Becauſe he was the firſt author of wickedneſſe:Ioh. 8. 44. that which Chriſt ſaith of one particular branch of wickedneſſe, may be applied to the generall, he is the father of wickedneſſe, and in that reſpect is ſaid to be a murtherer from the beginning.
                     
                     2 Becauſe by nature hee is moſt impure: no iot, no dramme of goodneſſe in him. If that be true of a naturall man,Gen. 6. 5. 
                        That all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart are onely euill continually, much more is it true of the Diuel.
                     3 Becauſe hee is moſt willing and forward vnto euill, taking delight therein. Not vnfitly may I apply the words of the Pſalmiſt to him,Pſal. 52. 3. 
                        He loueth euill more then good, and lies more then to ſpeake truth. He is of himſelfe ſo ſet on miſchiefe, that hee needeth none to egge him forward: neither doth it euer repent him of any euill that he doth.
                     4 Becauſe euill is his continuall practice: what good hee can hee hindreth, and draweth as many as he can to euill: all his temptations are to wickedneſſe. Firſt hee tempted man to ſinne, and euer ſince ceaſeth hee not more and more to ſtirre him vp thereunto, and that not onely by himſelfe, but alſo by his inſtruments the fleſh, the world, perſecutors, idolaters, heretikes, profane men, &amp;c.

                         Heereby may wee take notice of the Diuels medling with vs,
 when he preuaileth againſt vs:How to know when the Diuell hath to doe with vs. Whenſoeuer we are ſolicited to any wickedneſſe, then is the Diuell at our elbow; when we commit any wickedneſſe, then hath the Diuell beguiled vs, and preuailed againſt vs. As by our diſpoſition to righteouſneſſe, and the fruits of holineſſe, we may know the powerful worke of the Spirit on vs, ſo we may know the rule of Satan in vs by the workes of wickedneſſe.Ioh. 8. 44. Chriſt proueth that the Iewes were of their father the Diuell, becauſe they did the luſts of their father the Diuell. For1 Ioh. 3. 8. 
                        he that committeth ſinne is of the Diuell,

                        who worketh in the children of diſobedience.
                     
                     This alſo may ſerue as a ſtrong motiue to diſſwade vs from all wickedneſſe,

By committing wickednes we make our ſelues the Diuels inſtruments, yea, his imps and lims, and we beare his Image. If it be a good motiue (as needs it muſt be a good motiue, for oft it is vrged by the holy Ghoſt) to ſtirre vs vp to holineſſe and righteouſneſſe,

                     Note this all profane men, all impious deſpiſers of God and of his holy Ordinances, all curſed ſwearers and blaſphemers, all cruell, malicious, rebellious, riotous, laſciuious, beaſtly perſons: in a word all wicked perſons note this; as here you carry the Diuels image, ſo aſſuredly ſhall ye in hel partake of his puniſhment and torment, if ye repent not.
                     
                         They who will haue nothing to doe with theſe ſpirits of wickedneſſe, muſt haue nothing to doe with wickedneſſe it ſelfe. Whoſoeuer let wickedneſſe reigne in them, let the Diuell reigne ouer them. Satan entereth not into vs but by wickedneſſe.
                  
                  
                     §. 29 Of the number of Diuels.
                     AS a generall amplification of all the forenamed arguments, in this deſcription of our ſpirituall enemies, note how euery branch is ſet down in the plural number,
Principallities, Powers, Worldly Gouernours, Spirits, whereby is implied, that
                     
                        The Diuels are many.
                        
                           Doct. 13. Many Diuels. If the queſtion be asked how many they be, I anſwere that it is a needleſſe, a curious, and doubtfull queſtion: there is no ground in Scripture for reſolution of it. If the holy Scripture decide not this queſtion, what Booke can decide it? yea, what neede is there that it ſhould be decided? too curious and too bold they hane been, who haue gone about to diuide them into nine orders, oppoſite to their conceited nine orders of good Angels, and in euery order to place certaine millions.
                     But to let paſſe theſe vncertainties, certaine it is that there are a very great number of helliſh ſpirits: forReu. 12, 7. they made an Hoſt to fight againſt Michael and his Angels: yea, we reade that there were not onely ſeauenLuk. 8. 2. 30. Diuels, but an whole legion in one Man: now a legion is computed to containe aboutHeſychi
                              •
                           s. 6666. If at once in one Man there were ſo many, how many were there in all the World beſides: for wee may ſuppoſe that no man is free at any time, but hath Diuels attending on him to ſolicit him to euill; ſo that it is euident, that though their iuſt number cannot be reckoned vp, yet that there is a very great number, yea (as the Apoſtle ſaith of good Angels)Heb. 12. 22. 
                        An innumerable company.
                     
                     
                        Queſt. Seeing there be ſo many Diuels, how is it that oftentimes there is mention made but ofVerſ. 11. one whom we are to reſiſt,1 Pet 5. 8. and ſtand againſt?Iam. 4. 7.
                     
                     
                        Anſwere. This ſheweth that they haue an head amongſt them;Omnes damones de Satanae veneno malitiae virtutem accipiunt, &amp; ſunt vnum in eo. Chryſ. in Mat. 12. hom. 29. and that he and they concurre in the ſame minde, and all aime at the ſame end: their forces are ſo vnited and combined together, as if they were all but one Diuell. Beſides, this word Diuell is a collectiue word, which compriſeth many vnder it: as Turke, Spaniard, &amp;c. Thus we ſay, all Chriſtendome together raiſed an army againſt the Turke: or England ſent forth an army againſt the Spaniard. Whether therefore we vſe theſe words Satan, Diuell, &amp;c. in the ſingular number, or Principallities, Powers, &amp;c. in the plurall number, all is one. Vnder one many are compriſed, and by many an vnited power is meant.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         This their number aggrauateth all the former points:
 If it be a fearefull and terrible thing to be vnder the bondage of one earthly Tyrant,The number of Diuels maketh them the more terrible what is it to be ſlaues to an innumerable company of Principallities, who haue ſuch power, are ſo malicious and miſchieuous, and are all ſpirits, and Diuels? One Diuell is able to foile many armies of fleſh and blood: what then is one poore man conſiſting of fleſh, to legions of Diuels? who haue no other hope but in fleſh and blood, haue no hope of ſafety at all, but are in a moſt miſerable plight. This helliſh Hoſt (if it were ſeen) could not but be much more terrible to ſuch, then the Hoſt of the Syrians was to him that cried out;2 Kin. 6. 15. 
                        Alaſſe maſter,
                        Comfort againſt the multitude of Diuels. 
                        how ſhall we doe? But to vs that fight vnder Chriſts banner, there are two ſtrong props. One, thatIbid. v. 16. 
                        they which are with vs, are more then they which are with them. The other, that1. Sam. 14. 6. 
                        there is no reſtraint to the Lord to ſaue by many or by few.
                        2. Chro. 14. 11. 1. More good Angels then euill. That there are more with vs then againſt vs, is apparent: for all the good Angels are with vs, watch ouer vs, and fight for vs. Now it is out of doubt that there are more good Angels then euill: for the Scripture ſpeaketh much more of the number of thoſe, then of theſe. As the Diuell had an hoſt of euill Angels with him, ſo hadReu. 72. 7. 
                        Michael an hoſt of good Angels with him. Mention is made of one legion of Diuels in one man, butMat. 26. 53. Chriſt could haue had more then 12. legions of good Angels to guard him (which amount to about 80000.)Dan. 7. 10. 
                        Daniel mentioneth a farre greater number, as thouſand thouſands, yea, ten thouſand thouſands: yea, yet further, to ſhew that all the ſet numbers which wee can ſet, come ſhort of their number, the Apoſtle termeth them,Heb. 12. 22. 
                        A company of innumerable Angels: ſurely then there are more with vs then againſt vs: for the good AngelsHeb. 1. 14. 
                        are all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for their ſakes, which ſhall bee heires of ſaluation.
                     
                     The conſideration of this is ſufficient to vphold vs,2. God able to ſaue againſt many. notwithſtanding the multitude of Diuels. But the other prop for our faith is much ſtronger and ſurer; which is Gods infinite power, whereby he is able to ſaue as well againſt many as few. For when we conſider that thouſand thouſands are as one to him, what neede the number of millions aſtoniſh vs, more then one? So that although the Diuels bee many wayes fearefull to them that are out of the guard of good Angels, and protection of God, yet not to be feared of ſuch as belong to Chriſt.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 30 Of Satans abode in the Aire.
                     THe fift and laſt argument whereby our enemies are deſcribed is in the laſt clauſe of this verſe, which of all the reſt is moſt doubtfull. Moſt Interpreters ſo expound it, as if the place of the Diuels were here ſet down,The aduantage of di
                              •
                           els in regard of their place. namely, the Aire, which is oft called Heauen; which being ſo, hereby is implied, that they haue very great aduantage againſt vs, by reaſon of the place where they are. For the Diuels being in the Aire,
                     1 They are aboue vs,1. They are aboue vs. ouer our heads, euery where round about vs, and ſo ſtill ready to annoy vs: this among men is counted a very great aduantage: a few men on a hill, or on high walles and Towers are able to doe much miſchiefe to a great Army in a low valley beneath them.
                     2 They can eſpy all things that we doe:2. They ouerlooke vs. ſo that in this reſpect wee are to bee the more circumſpect ouer our ſelues, and vigilant againſt them. They which haue enuious, malicious enemies, which ouerlooke them, and ſo can ſee whatſoeuer they doe, will be carefull that they doe nothing whereby thoſe eſpiers may take aduantage to accuſe them, or to worke any miſchiefe againſt them.
                     3 They are in their owne Kingdome:3. They fight in their owne Kingdome. for the Diuell isChap. 2. v. 2. 
                        a Prince that ruleth in the Aire: Now amongſt men, they which are in their owne Dominion, where they haue all at command, where they may haue ſtill new ſupply, haue a great aduantage. And they which warre in their enemies Dominions, had need bee backed with a farre greater power then their enemies haue: but wee of our ſelues are far weaker, and leſſe in power then our ſpirituall enemies, and we fight with them in the aire, which is their Kingdome, where they haue all at command: haue they not then in this reſpect a great aduantage? haue not we need to be backed with a far greater power?
                     Theſe and ſuch like obſeruations may be drawne from this circumſtance of the place: which I haue the rather noted becauſe moſt doe ſo interpret this clauſe.
                  
                  
                     §. 31 Of the cauſe of Satans quarrell.
                     BVt yet freely and ingenuouſly to make known my owne iudgement (with ſubmiſſion to better iudgements) I rather thinke that the Apoſtle here meaneth the cauſe or prize of this combate, for which it is maintained, as if it were thus tranſlated, In heauenly things. My reaſons are theſe.
                     1 In the originall, places are not expreſt, but indefinitely the Apoſtle ſaith,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        In heauenlies. Now when an adiectiue is ſo ſet alone, moſt vſually the ſubſtantiue vnderſtood, is thing or things.
                     
                     2 In other places being thus indefinitely ſet downe, it is taken for heauenly things, and ſo tranſlated, as Heb. 8. 5.
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           .
                        They ſerue vnto the example and ſhadow of heauenly things.
                     3 This word, being oft vſed in the new Teſtament, at leaſt twenty ſeuerall times, is neuer vſed in any mans opinion (this place onely excepted) of any aeriall place, or thing, but of thoſe things which are truely heauenly and ſpirituall:
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . the word it ſelfe according to the proper notation thereof, ſignifieth the vpper heauenlies: ſo as moſt improperly it is taken for the loweſt Heauens, the aire.
                     4 It is not a matter of ſo great weight and moment for ſpirits to bee in high places ouer vs, for they can as much annoy vs being beſide vs, within vs, beneath vs, as aboue vs: high places may be an helpe to men who are clogged with fleſh and blood, to ſpirits they can be ſmall aduantages.
                     
                         5 The words being expounded of heauenly things, this laſt clauſe addeth as great weight to the diſcription of our enemies as any of the former, as wee ſhall ſee when we handle the Doctrine.
                     6 Both ancient and later Diuines,Chryſoſt, Muſcul. Perkins on Gal. 2. 11. and thoſe of good learning and iudgement, haue thus expounded this clauſe; ſo as it is no new or priuate conceite of mine.
                     
                        Obiection. This very word is oft indefinitely vſed, as here; and yet it ſignifieth Places, as Chap. 1. Verſ. 3. 20. &amp; 2. 6. &amp;c.
                     
                     
                        Anſwere. Though it ſignifie heauenly places, yet not ſuch as are in the loweſt heauen the aire, but the higheſt, which is not the place of Diuels; thither becauſe the Diuell cannot come, I expound it Heauenly things.
                     
                     
                        Obiect. 2. The phraſe will not beare this expoſition: for the prepoſition in, is neuer put for the cauſe.
                     
                        Anſw.
                        Illud in coeleſtib. eſt pro eo quod eſt pro coeleſtib. Cryſ. One of the Greeke Fathers, who was very skilfull in the propriety of that tongue, ſo expoundeth it. Beſides, this particle is ſo vſed in other places of the new Teſtament: twice in one verſe, namely Mat. 10. 32. Whoſoeuer ſhall confeſſe me, I will confeſſe him, &amp;c: word for word, in me, in him.

                           . Here the prepoſition in ſignifieth the cauſe, as if he had ſaid; he that ſhall make confeſſion before men for my ſake, I will make confeſſion before my Father for his ſake. So againe, Mat. 11. 6. Bleſſed is he whoſoeuer ſhall not be offended
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        in me, that is, for
my ſake: and Mat. 26. 31. All ye ſhall be offended
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        in me. The Kings Tranſlators turne it, becauſe of me. So in this my Text, this laſt clauſe hauing reference to the principall verbe, may be thus tranſlated; Wee wreſtle becauſe of heauenly things.
                     
                     The Doctrine then which hence I gather is this:
                     
                        The maine things for which the Diuels fight againſt vs are
                        Doct. 14.
                        
                        heauenly matters.
                        Diuels fight to ſtrip vs of heauenlie matters. Before I proceede further to proue, or apply this point, I will a little more fully explaine it.
                     1 By heauenly matters, I meane ſuch as principally reſpect Gods glory (for God being himſelfe Heauenly, whatſoeuer tendeth to his Honour, is in that reſpect Heauenly,) and then ſuch as reſpect our ſoules ſaluation: for as the things which concerne the temporall good of our body are earthly, ſo the things which concerne the eternall good of our ſoules are Heauenly: for to Heauen they aſpire, and in Heauen ſhall they enioy their happineſſe.
                     2 Where (I ſay) the Diuels fight for heauenly matters,Non vt ipſi victoriam adepti aliquod conſequantur, ſed vt nos priuent. Chryſoſt. matters, my meaning is, not that they deſire to get them, but that they endeauour to ſpoile vs of them: ſo that in this combate the prize propounded to vs is heauenly; namely, whether we will ſerue our Heauenly Father, or the helliſh feene: whether we will let goe, or faſt hold that heauenly treaſure which Chriſt hath purchaſed for vs, all thoſe heauenly things whereby God is honoured, and our ſoules are ſaued.
                     For proofe that they be heauenly things which Satan eſpecially aimes at, obſerue thoſe ſeuerall temptations recorded in the Scripture: I will giue a taſte of ſome.
Gen. 3. 1: &amp;c. What aimed he at in tempting Adam and Eue? was it not to deface Gods Image in them, and to ſtrip them of that happineſſe wherein God had created them? The iſſue ſheweth as much. What ſought hee in tempting Chriſt?Mat. 4. 3. 9. was it not to make him doubt whether he were the Sonne of God or no? yea, and vtterly renounce God, and worſhip the Diuell?Luk. 22. 31. 32. Was it not Peters faith that he ſought to winow? Doth he not blind mens eyes,2 Cor. 4. 4. 
                        that the light of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt, which is the Image of God, ſhould not ſhine vnto them? As for earthly things he maketh not much account of them, hee can be well content to let men enioy them, he caſts them to men as baits: wee reade howMat. 4. 8, 9. hee offered to Chriſt all the kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them, if Chriſt would haue worſhipped him.
                     
                        Obiect.
                        Iob 1. He depriued Iob of his temporall eſtate.
                     
                        Anſw. It was an higher matter which Satan aimed at, namely, to bring him to denie God, and blaſpheme him to his face;Iob 1. 11. as may bee gathered by Satans anſwere to God.
                     He would make all like to himſelfe. Thorow his pride hee is fallen from Heauen, and vtterly ſpoiled and depriued of all heauenly goodneſſe and happineſſe; wherefore he ſeekes alſo to depriue man of the like.
                     Behold here the malice of the Diuell:
                           Vſe. The Diuels malice. it is no good that hee ſeeketh for himſelfe by this fierce and long conflict which he maintaineth, but our woe and miſery.1 Pet. 5. 8. 
                        Hee ſeeketh whom to deuoure. Malice firſt moued him to aſſault man, and malice ſtill whets him on to continue his fight againſt mankinde. Durſt he euer haue ventred on Chriſt Ieſus the Sonne of God, but that malice wholly poſſeſſed him? Not vnfitly therefore are many titles giuen vnto him in Scripture to ſet forth his malice, asZac. 3. 1. 
                        Satan, which ſignifieth an aduerſary;

                        Murtherer, and Father of lies. If the reaſons of all theſe names (which are not hard to gather) be duly weighed,
                           Vſe 2. Wee fight for no ſmall matter. they will ſhew that hee is euen made of malice.
                     Among other motiues to ſtirre vs vp to arme our ſelues well,Vide quomodo vires inimici nos excitant eo quod ſcimus de rebus magnis eſſe periculum. Chryſoſt. and conſtantly to ſtand and fight againſt the Diuell, this is none of the leaſt. It is no ſmall matter that we fight for, but a matter of the greateſt weight and conſequence that can be. Satan could ſay (Iob 2. 4.) All that a man hath will he giue for his life: yet is life but a temporall and earthly matter. If all for his life, what for his ſoule, and the ſaluation thereof, which is an heauenly matter? ſo as there is no compariſon betwixt them.Mat. 16. 26. 
                        What then ſhall it profit a man, though hee ſhould win the whole World, if he loſe his owne ſoule? or what ſhall a man giue for recompence of his ſoule?
                        Simil. When wiſe Captaines ſee that a ſore and fierce battaile is to bee fought, which with the very rumor thereof may diſhearten their ſouldiers, they vſe to hearten and encourage them by bringing to their mind, and ſetting before them the prize, or cauſe of their fight: ſome will ſay, Loe, ye fight for whole Townes, and Cities, and Kingdomes: others, Yee fight not to get that which is other mens, but to keepe that which is your owne; yee fight for your Countrey, your lands and inheritances, your wiues and children: others, It is not honour and conqueſt, they are not goods and lands that ye fight for, but liberty and life: ſtand to it therefore, if the day be loſt, ye are either dead men, or ſlaues.
                     Note how the Philiſtims encouraged one another,1 Sam. 4. 9. 
                        Be ſtrong and play the men, O Philiſtims, that ye be not ſeruants to the Hebrews. Now all theſe are but earthly matters; but I may ſay to the Lords ſouldiers, It is the Lord of Heauen whoſe battels ye fight, his honour is ingaged therein; it is your ſoules ſaluation, and heauenly happineſſe, which is in hazard: your enemies ſeeke to ſpoile you of the precious graces of Gods ſanctifying Spirit, and to depriue you of that rich &amp; glorious inheritance, which Chriſt by no leſſe price then his owne blood hath purchaſed for you: if ye yeeld to your enemies, all theſe yee loſe, and become vaſſals vnto your mortall and malicious enemie the Diuell, ye are euen fire-brands of Hell. Be ſtrong therefore, and of a valiant courage: feare not, but fight and ſtand it out to the vttermoſt; ſo ſhall ye be more then conquerers.
                     
                         The things which eſpecially we ought to looke vnto,

                           ſe things which Satan moſt ſeeketh to ſpoile thee of. to be watchfull ouer, and to labour to keepe ſafe, are the forenamed heauenly things: and that not onely in regard of the excellency and worth of them, but alſo in regard of Satans maine oppoſition againſt them. What hee in malice doth moſt aſſault, wee in wiſdome muſt moſt defend, and ſet foote to foote againſt him: if an enemy bring all his forces againſt the chiefeſt Tower of a City, wiſe Citizens will thither bring their beſt munition, and ſtrongeſt defence: if thus wee deale with Satan, wee ſhall oppoſe godly wiſedome to his wicked ſubtilty, and ſo keepe our ſelues ſafe from all his aſſaults. This is the wiſdome which the Apoſtle here teacheth vs by thoſe ſeuerall peeces of Armour, which follow to be handled: for they are all concerning heauenly things, and tend to the ſaluation of the ſoule.
                  
               
               
                  THE FOVRTH PART.
                  A repetition of the meanes.
                  
                     Epheſ. 6. 13.
                     For this cauſe take vnto you the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to withſtand in the euill day, and hauing done all, to ſtand.
                  
                  
                     §. 1. Of repeating one and the ſame thing.
                     
                        HEre the Apoſtle returneth againe to the ſecond part of his former direction, and repeateth in effect the very ſame things which he deliuered in the 11. verſe: namely, how we may keepe our ſelues ſafe againſt the forenamed enemies.
                     We may not thinke that this his repetition is vaine and idle:Why wee are againe and againe called vpon to put on armour. for he was guided by Gods holy Spirit, who doth nothing in vaine. Note what Ioſeph ſaith of the iteration of one and the ſame thing to Pharaoh in two dreames,
Gen. 41. 32. 
                        The dreame was doubled the ſecond time, becauſe the thing is establiſhed by God, and God haſteth to performe it. Many good reaſons may bee giuen why here the Apoſtle thus repeateth his direction, as, to ſhew,
                     1 That what before he had deliuered, was vpon very good aduice deliuered: not raſhly, ſo as he doubted whether he might ſtand to it or no, but ſo as he dares auouch it againe and againe, as being an infallible truth, which he alſo knew to be a truth.Gal. 1. 8. 9. Like to that thundering denunciation of a curſe againſt all that ſhould preach another Goſpell, which he laieth downe twice together.
                     2 That it was a needefull, behoouefull, and profitable truth: a moſt ſoueraigne and neceſſary meanes to keepe vs ſafe: neceſſary for vs, in regard of our owne inabilitie to ſtand faſt without it; ſoueraigne in regard of the ſufficiency of the meanes, which can and will (being rightly vſed) keepe vs ſafe.Phil. 3. 1. Marke the reaſon why it was not greeuous to the Apoſtle to write the ſame things, euen becauſe to them to whom he wrote, it was ſafe.
                     
                     3 That naturally wee are backward and ſluggiſh in vſing this armour: therefore hee thought it not enough once to vrge the point, but againe preſſeth it. ThusPro. 2. 1, &amp;c. &amp; 3. 1, &amp;c. 
                        Salomon oft repeateth diuers exhortations. So Captaines when they ſee their ſouldiers loath to arme when there is great need they ſhould arme, will call vpon them again and againe to arme.
                           Vſe 1. Weighty points oft to be vrged.
                     
                     Miniſters may here learne, as iuſt occaſion is giuen, to call their people to the remembrance of weighty points, eſpecially ſuch as they obſerue their people moſt backeward vnto. It is not ſufficient once to haue deliuered ſuch a point, but againe, and if neede be, againe it is to be vrged. The Apoſtle hauing propounded Chriſt a patterne of patience to the Hebrewes, becauſe he was a moſt worthy and perfect patterne,Heb. 12. 3.  he calleth them
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        againe to conſider him. Thus ſhall Miniſters ſhew that they make a difference betwixt points of leſſe or greater need; and that they haue reſpect to the good of their people.
                     
                        Obiection. Many will ſay that Miniſters want matter, and therefore repeate the ſame things.
                     
                        Anſwer. The very ſame may be obiected againſt the repetitions vſed by the Prophets, by Chriſt himſelfe, by his Apoſtles, and other faithfull and able Miniſters. But let Miniſters ſee that they doe it not vpon idleneſſe, but iuſt cauſe, and then need they not feare ſuch cauils.
                     People muſt heere learne patience, not to ſnuffe,
                           Vſe. 2. Patiently heare the ſame things oft. or be diſcontent if they heare the ſame thing againe, which before they heard. This impatiency argueth an2. Tim. 4. 3. 
                        itching eare, which cannot endure a repetition of any thing, and if ſheweth that they haue more reſpect vnto the eare, thē to the heart:Num. 11. 6. like the Iſraelites, which had more reſpect to their outward taſte, then to their inward nouriſhment, and thereupon loathed Manna becauſe they had ſo often taſted of it. This maketh people get them an heape of Teachers.
                        2. Tim. 4. 3.
                     
                     In particular concerning the preſent point in hand,
                           Vſe. 3. This point of the Armour of God a weighty point perſwade we our ſelues, that it is a point worthy to be attended vnto with all diligence, and to be obſerued with good conſcience; that ſo we may giue the more earneſt heed thereunto, and not let it ſlip. Haue we alſo an holy iealouſie and ſuſpition ouer our ſelues, fearing leſt wee ſhould bee too careleſſe in vſing theſe meanes for our ſafety, yea, too incredulous in beleeuing the good vſe and benefit of them. Therefore rouze we vp our ſelues: for where the Spirit is moſt earneſt in vrging a point, we muſt be moſt heedefull in marking it.
                  
                  
                     §. 2. Danger muſt make watchfull.
                     BEfore wee come to the particular branches of this verſe, note the inference of it vpon the former, which is plainely implied in theſe words,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        For this cauſe, that is, becauſe yee haue ſuch terrible enemies as haue beene deſcribed vnto you, Take the whole Armour, &amp;c. By this inference the Apoſtle giueth vs to vnderſtand, that,
                     
                        The more dreadfull and dangerous our enemies be,
                        
                           Doct. The more dreadfull our enemies, the more watchfull we. 
                        the more carefull ought we to be to ſtand vpon our guard, and to looke to our defence. This is in effect the ſame that was deliuered in the beginning of the 12. verſe, wee will therefore no longer inſiſt vpon it.
                  
                  
                     §. 3. A reſolution of the verſe.
                     THis verſe may be diuided and branched forth as the 11. verſe was.
                     The Summe of it is a Direction to inſtruct vs how to defend and keepe our ſelues ſafe againſt the Diuell.
                     The parts are two. The firſt ſheweth what are the meanes of ſafety. The ſecond declareth the end why theſe meanes are to be vſed.
                     In the firſt he declareth, 1. What the meanes be. 2. How to be vſed.
                     The meanes are the very ſame which were deliuered in the 11. verſe, namely, The whole Armour of God. I ſhall neede to ſpeake no more thereof.
                     For vſing the meanes, the Apoſtle ſetteth downe an other word then before: there he ſaid; Put on: Here take vnto you. Both words in generall imploy one and the ſame thing. This latter word is a compound word, and ſignifieth ſometimes,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        To take vp, or to take vnto your ſelues: Sometimes to take againe, or recouer. We are ſaid to take vp vnto our ſelues ſuch things as we haue not of our ſelues, and to take againe or recouer that which wee haue loſt or let goe. Both ſignifications may be here applied.
                  
                  
                     §. 4. Whence our defence commeth.
                     FRom the firſt I gather, that,
                     
                        The graces whereby we are armed,
                        
                           Doct. 1. Our defeece is not from our ſelues. 
                        are no vertues or qualities which ariſe from our ſelues: for then it were improperly ſaid; Take vnto you. Theſe graces are ſome of thoſe eſpeciall gifts whichIam. 1. 17. 
                        come from aboue, which we1. Cor. 4. 7. 
                        receiue.
                     
                     By nature we are borne in our ſoules as naked and deſtitute of ſpirituall Armour,Reaſon. as in ourIob. 1. 21. bodies of outward cloathing. Reade Ezec. 16. 4. 5. &amp;c.

 If we find our ſelues deſtitute of this Armour, we muſt ſeeke it, not in our ſelues, but out of our ſelues, euen where it is to be had; and that is in the Lord: for euery perfect gift commeth from the Father of lights.
                        
                           Iam. 1.5. He giueth it to ſuch as ſeeke it by faithfull prayer in the meanes appointed by him, which are his holy word and Sacraments. When there is newes of the enemies comming to inuade our Land, and thereupon Proclamations and Edicts ſent forth to charge all to arme themſelues: then euery one that either regardeth his owne ſafety, or his Soueraignes charge, ſeeketh out armour: and to the Armories doe they which haue none, reſort. We haue the ſame motiues to ſtirre vs vp to ſeeke ſpirituall armour.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 5. Of the repaire of Grace.
                     FRom the ſecond I gather that,
                     
                        The graces which are decayed in vs,
                        
                           Doct. 2. Grace decay ed, may be repaired. 
                        or ſeeme to be loſt, may be reſumed and recouered. Thus much intimateth Chriſt vnto Peter, ſaying,Luke 22. 31. 
                        When thou art conuerted, &amp;c. This cannot be meant of his firſt conuerſion, which long before was wrought in him, but of his recouery. The Prophets oft call vpon Gods people, who had made themſelues naked, and fallen off from their Lord and Captaine the Lord God, to returne againe vnto him. Very expreſſe and direct for this purpoſe is theReu. 2 5. charge of Chriſt to Epheſus, Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and doe the firſt workes.
                        Pſal. 51. 10. 12. Was it not the recouery of grace which Dauid ſo earneſtly prayed for? In faith he prayed, and was heard.
                     Two ſtrong props there be to ſtrengthen our faith in the recouery of grace.Reaſons. One without vs, which is the Author of grace. The other within vs, which is the ſeed of grace.
                     1. It is God who is the author of grace,1. God is the Author of Grace. who as in his nature, ſo likewiſe in his properties, is vnchangeable: ſo that the ſame cauſe which moued God for to beſtow the graces of his Spirit on a man,Iam. 1. 17. ſtill remaineth in him to make him renew his Spirit, and that is his mercy and goodnes, which can no more be turned from his children then the Sunne be pulled out of Heauen.Simil. A cloud may hinder the bright beames of the Sunne, yet ſtil it ſhineth, and will at length breake forth: ſo the beames of Gods kindneſſe by the cloudes of our infirmities may be kept from vs, but ſtill there remaineth mercy in GOD, which will at length breake through thoſe Cloudes. For whom God once loueth1 Ioh. 13. 1. 
                        hee loueth vnto the end: and in this reſpect the graces of his holy Spirit are termed

                        gifts without repentance.
                     
                     2 The ſeed of grace is not1 Pet. 1. 23.

One would think it ſufficient that once hee beſtowed on vs whole Armour, euen ſuch as is ſufficient to keepe vs ſafe, if our ſelues be not in fault. But when thorow our default any of the peeces thereof are faulty or miſſing, to make it all vp whole againe, much amplifieth his goodneſſe.
                     This alſo ſheweth a maine difference betwixt the Law and the Goſpell.
                        A difference betwixt the Law and the Goſpell. 'For the Law leaueth no place to repentance, nor affordeth any meanes to reſume that which is loſt, or recouer that which is decaied, but vtterly condemneth a man for that which is loſt or decaied: for it ſaith; Curſed is euery one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Booke of the Law to doe them.

Thus the Law ſetteth forth the rigour of Gods iuſtice, the Goſpell the riches of his mercy.
                  
                  
                     §. 6. Why the whole Armour is to be vſed.
                     THe ende why this whole Armour is to bee vſed, now followeth. It conſiſteth of two branches,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         Firſt to withſtand, which implieth a fight. Secondly, to
ſtand faſt, which implieth the iſſue of the fight, victory, and conqueſt: both of them amplified with a circumſtance of time, but in a differing manner. The firſt hath reſpect to the time preſent (in the euill day.) The ſecond to the time paſt (hauing done all.) In ſetting downe the end, hee alſo declareth the benefit of this Armour (that ye may be able) whereof we haue ſpoken on the 1.
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         verſe.
                     The word whereby the end in the firſt branch is expreſſed, is not altogether the ſame that was vſed in the 11. verſe. The word there vſed was ſimple
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        to ſtand. Here it is compound
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        to withſtand, or ſtand againſt. This is a word of defiance and combate, and it alſo implieth the manner of fight, which is face to face, hand to hand, foote to foote, not yeelding an haires breadth to the enemy.
                  
                  
                     §. 7. Of manfull ſtanding.
                     HEere then are two duties to bee obſerued of all ſuch as haue taken vnto them the whole Armour o
                           •
                         God.
                     
                         1 That ſtoutly they ſtand againſt their enemies,
                        
                           Doct. 3. Stand ſtoutly. 
                        and bid them defiance: Hereof wee ſhall ſpeake more on the firſt word of the next verſe.
                     2 That they giue no place vnto them.
                        
                           Doct. 4. Giue no place to the enemy. This is a duty which theChap. 4. v 27 Apoſtle in expreſſe words commandeth.Iam. 4. 7. Oft it is implied vnder this word that is here vſed.Mat. 4 3. &amp;c. A worthy patterne wee haue hereof in the example of our Lord and Generall,1 Pet. 5. 9. Chriſt Ieſus, who ſtill withſtood Satan in euery aſſault, and would not yeeld any whit at all in any of his temptations.
                     Our arch-enemy is both crafty as a Fox,Reaſon. and cruell as a Lyon: his craft will make him ſoone eſpie and take an aduantage: his cruelty will make him follow it to the vttermoſt.
                     Great is their follie who firſt yeeld a little,
                           Vſe Great folly to yeeld a little. and then thinke well enough to acquit themſelues: they much deceiue themſelues: for after they haue once yeelded, they haue neither will nor power to ſtand, as they had before. For as Satan is ſubtill, ſo isHeb. 3. 13. ſinne deceitfull: who once hath taſted of it, will ſcarce content himſelfe with a taſte, but will ſtill more and more hunger after it. Thouſands are deceiued therewith, and by ſmall yeeldings at firſt, at length cleane ouerthrowne. An eſpeciall point of wiſdome it is duly to conſider our owne folly and weakeneſſe together with the Diuels craft and power, how in our ſelues (without this Armour) there is no compariſon betwixt vs and our enemies: yea, alſo to conſider the nature of ſinne, and our proneneſſe thereunto; that ſo we may reſolutely ſet our ſelues againſt all temptations, not yeelding any whit at all to any. Who almoſt findeth not by wofull experience that a little yeelding hath cauſed a great ouerthrow?
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 8. Of the euill day.
                     THe time againſt which the forenamed Armour is prepared is next to bee handled. It is here termed
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        the euill day. By euill is meant not ſo much ſinne as trouble: and day is put for any continuance of time. Some take
euill day for the whole time of a mans life, yea for the continuance of this World, all which time Satan aſſaulteth vs, but no longer.
                     This I take to be too large an extent of this phraſe, for in the originall there is to each word adioined an article,
that day, that euill day, which implieth ſome ſet and diſtinct time; wherefore other reſtraine it to the day of a mans death: but that I take to be too ſtrict a reſtraint: there are many other daies and times wherein vſe is to be made of Armour. Wherefore in the meane betwixt both, I expound the euill day to bee that time wherein Satan ſhall any way ſet vpon vs and aſſault vs, whether by outward afflictions, or otherwiſe. All his temptations tend to euil; and therefore the time wherein he aſſaulteth vs may well be termed an euill day.
                     
                        Queſt. When commeth that day?
                     
                        Anſwer. It is no more knowne before hand then the day of death, or the day of iudgement. Whenſoeuer the Lord letteth looſe the raines to Satan, then is that euill day. That time wherein the Diuell depriued Iob of all he had, ſmote his body with ſore boiles, vexed him by his wife and friends, were euill daies to Iob.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 9. Of Satans being looſe.
                     IN that the Apoſtle telleth vs of an euil day, hee implieth
                     
                        
                        There hee times appointed wherein the Diuell ſhall bee let looſe,
                        
                           Doct. 5. There are times where in the Diue
                              •
                           l ſhall bee let looſe. 
                        and haue liberty to aſſault vs. This the Apoſtle expreſly foretold, ſaying,2 Tim. 3. 1. 
                        There ſhall come perillous times. Marke the anſwere that was made to the ſoules vnder the Altar,Reu. 6. 10. 11. 
                        That they ſhould reſt till their brethren which ſhould be killed as they were, were fulfilled. Thereby is declared, that as they which were dead had their euill daies, ſo the liuing ſhould haue their euill daies. TheActs 14. 22. Apoſtle maketh a neceſſity hereof, and putteth a muſt vnto it, ſaying;
Wee muſt thorow many afflictions enter into the Kingdome of God. As there are common times of triall for whole Churches, ſo for particular perſons. There is ſmall reaſon for any to doubt hereof, but it is a point of good wiſdome for all to looke for it. For who is there that hath not felt ſome experience hereof, and by his owne experience can verifie the truth of this point?
                     The Lord will haue all his tried:Reaſons. for ſo is his owne power, mercy, and wiſdome the more manifeſted in his Saints; and ſo are his enemies the more confounded. Beſides, the Lord will heereby make a difference betwixt his Church here on earth, and in Heauen.
                     Be not ſecure, as if no euill day could or would come:
                           Vſe. Be not ſecure. this is a moſt dangerous conceit, whereby the Diuell getteth great aduantage, for thus he ſuddenly ſurpriſeth many: and yet it is the conceit of too too many; In their peace and proſperity they thinke there ſhall be no alteration, they ſhall neuer be moued: not onelyPſal. 10. 6. careleſſe worldlings, but oftentimes Gods children fall into this conceit, asPſal. 30, 6. 
                        Dauid. Take we heede hereof, though for a while wee thinke all well, yet alwaies it ſhall not bee ſo: the euill day commeth ſooner vpon ſome; later vpon others; longer it tarrieth with ſome, ſhorter with others, yet it comes vpon all: though it bee vncertaine when it commeth, and how long it tarrieth, yet moſt certaine it is that it will come.
                  
                  
                     §. 10. Of preparation againſt triall.
                     AS another vſe of this, marke the next point, for in regard hereof the Apoſtle counſelleth vs to prepare againſt it: yea, he maketh mention of the euill day, as of a motiue to make vs watchfull and carefull to arme our ſelues againſt it. Now then in that he biddeth vs take armour, that wee may ſtand in the euill day, his counſell is, that
                     
                        Preparation muſt be made before hand,
                        
                           Doct. 6. Preparation to be made againſt time of triall. 
                        againſt the time of triall.
                        Iob 1. 5. The care which Iob had for his children before hand, muſt wee haue for our ſelues. It ſhould ſeeme that hee himſelfe looked for the euill daies that came vpon him: for hee ſaith; The thing which I greatly feared is come vpon me,

                        &amp;c. And this was it which made himIam. 5. 11. ſo well endure ſo ſore aſſaults. Very carefull was Chriſt in preparing the Diſciples againſt his departure, becauſe he knew there were euill daies comming vpon them. The laſt petition of the Lords prayer tendeth to this purpoſe.
                     If preparation be not before hand made,Reaſon. we may ſuddenly bee ſurpriſed and ouercome,Iudg. 18. like the people of
Lat
                              •
                           h. But if wee be well prepared, we may well be the more ſecure.
                     What is like to bee the iſſue of them who put the euill day farre away from them,
                           Vſe. Bee not careleſſe. and neuer thinke of reſiſting the euill one till hee ſet vpon them? Many thus plunge themſelues into much miſery. The children of this world are in this reſpect wiſer then many Chriſtians: for they vſe in time of peace to haue their trainings, muſterings, tiltings, and many other martiall exerciſes, that thus they may bee beforehand prepared for warre.
                     Let vs in the time of our greateſt tranquillity meditate of the euill to come:
                           Vſe 2. In time of peace meditate of the euill day. and for our helpe herein, obſerue what euill falleth vpon others, and conſider the like or worſe might haue fallen, or may afterwards fall vpon vs: and therefore thorowly examine our ſelues, and ſearch what faith, what hope, what righteouſneſſe, what ſincerity, what other good and needfull graces we haue in vs, that wee be not to ſeeke of our Armour when the Diuell commeth to aſſault vs.
                     Hitherto of the firſt branch, concerning the End of arming our ſelues.
                  
                  
                     §. 11. Of the multitude of trials.
                     THe ſecond followeth, wherein the circumſtance of
Time is firſt laid downe, and firſt to be handled: It is in theſe words, hauing done all things; that is, hauing well paſſed ouer all thoſe brunts, whereunto yee ſhall bee brought, and well acquitted your ſelues.
                     Here firſt the Apoſtle implieth, that
                     
                        Many trials are to bee vndergone,
                        
                           Doct. 7. Many trials to bee paſſed thorow. many aſſaults to bee withſtood, before we can looke to be free and ſafe.Acts 14, 22. 
                        Thorow many afflictions we muſt enter into the Kingdome of God.
                        Pſal. 34. 19. 
                        Many are the troubles of the righteous. This was preſented vnto vs in Chriſt our head, and in all his faithfull members in all ages, in Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, &amp;c.
                     The ancient Iewes were an eſpeciall type hereof. Canaan, a place of reſt and quiet was promiſed vnto them; but before they entered into it, they went into Aegypt, and were there bondmen; from thence they came into the Wilderneſſe, where they were brought to many ſtraites and difficulties; and laſtly, many ſore battels fought, before they could haue reſt in Canaan.
                     
                     This partly ariſeth from Gods good and wiſe ordering matters to his owne glory,
                           Reaſons. See the reaſō of Doct. 1. on verſe 11. and his childres good: and partly from Satans inſatiable cruelty, who neuer thinkes he hath aſſaulted enough, ſo long as a Chriſtian ſouldier ſtandeth: It was a ſore blow he gaue Iob when he depriued him of all his goods, and children; a blow that might haue ſtrucken another cleane downe, yea, ſtarke dead: but becauſe he ſtood ſtoutly, hee lent him another blow, which was much ſorer; yea, ſtill hee laid on with all his might, till God would ſuffer him to ſtrike no longer. The like vnſatiableneſſe is manifeſted in his inſtruments: Inſtance
Sauls purſuing of Dauid, and the Phariſes perſecuting of Chriſt: they were neuer ſatisfied.
                     Thinke not the Chriſtian combate ended when ſome few battels are fought,
                           Vſe 1. A few skirmiſhes finiſh not the Chriſtians combat: and that thou art now out of all danger, becauſe thorow Gods mercy and power thou haſt hitherto beene deliuered; rather expect and prepare for more. No doubt but Peter thought himſelfe ſafe enough, when one maide which would haue betraied him was gone away: butMat. 26. 69. &amp;c. wee reade that a ſecond came to him, yea others alſo. Wherefore ſo long as Satan hath liberty, (which will be ſo long as wee, or any other man liueth in this World) let vs be watchfull, and ſtill prepared for many aſſaults one after another. Many ſtout victorious Monarchs haue beene ouerthrowne, becauſe after a conqueſt they feared no freſh aſſault, and ſo haue beene ſuddenly ſurpriſed. It ſhould ſeeme that Belſhazzar was ſo ouertaken,Dan. 5. 1. 30. becauſe the ſame day that hee made his royall feaſt, himſelfe was ſlaine, and his kingdome taken by Darius.
                     
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 Many thinke,
 that by reaſon of thoſe many aſſaults which the Diuell maketh againſt them, and the many tryals whereunto they are brought,Many are oft aſſaulted, who are not forſaken. God hath vtterly forſaken them, and giuen them ouer to the power of their enemies; this then may ſerue for their comfort, and as a prop to vphold them, that God doth thus order the eſtate of his children, that many things muſt be done and finiſhed before we can looke for reſt.
                  
                  
                     §. 12. Of holding out.
                     THe word which the Apoſtle vſeth to ſet downe the time of conqueſt,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         is a word of perfection, and implieth a full and finall ending of a matter: to it hee addeth a very generall particle all:
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         whereby he teacheth vs that,
                     
                        It is not ſufficient well to begin the fight,
                        
                           Doct. 8. All aſſaults muſt be held out. 
                        and make a good onſet, nor yet to hold out the brunt of ſome aſſaults, but all how many ſoeuer, and of what kind ſoeuer muſt be held out, all muſt be finiſhed before we can looke for victory. Hee that ſaith all, excepteth not any at all.Heb. 10, 32, 33, &amp;c. This perfect finiſhing of all, is it whereunto the Apoſtle ſo earneſtly exhorteth the Hebrewes, and plainely telleth them, that yet longer they were to endure, becauſeHeb. 12. 4. 
                        they had not reſiſted vnto blood, and therefore not finiſhed all. In this reſpect ſaith Saint Iames,

                        Let patience haue her perfect worke. This was Chriſts care,Joh 4. 34. 
                        to finiſh all: therefore when hee was going to his tryumph, he ſaid,&amp; 17. 4.

                        It is finiſhed. So the Apoſtle (1. Cor. 11. 1. who would haue vs follow him, as he followed Chriſt)2. Tim. 4. 7. 
                        I haue fought a good fight, and haue finiſhed my courſe.

                        ouercomming He that preuaileth in ſome conflicts, and is at length ouerthrowne, cannot properly be ſaid to ouercome: ſo thatGal. 3. 4. all which is done, is in vaine, if all be not done: For marke what the Lord ſaith;Heb. 10. 38. 
                        If any man draw back, my ſoule ſhall haue no pleaſure in him. Saul fought many of the Lords battels valiantly; but he withdrew himſelfe, and the Lord forſooke him, ſo as at length hee was ouerthrowne. Was not the glory of all the former victories vtterly daſht hereby? did not the Philiſtims as much (if not ſo much the more) inſult ouer him? So will the Diuell.
                     Be carefull to adde conſtancy vnto courage,
                           Vſe. Conſtancy. if thou deſire the crowne of conqueſt; and though thou haſt done many things, yet giue not ouer ſo long as there remaineth any thing to be done. Doe not ſo much conſider what conflicts haue beene endured, as how many are yet ſtill to be endured. Regard what is to come, rather then what is paſt.Phil. 3. 13. This was Saint Pauls mind. Many in all ages, who haue done many things, haue loſt the crowne of glory, becauſe they haue not done all. I would the times and ages wherein we liue, did not affoord ſo many examples of back-ſliding, as they doe. Many haue fallen, more are like to fall: the times are euill, men are weake, all of vs prone to faint.
                  
                  
                     §. 13. Of the iſſue of conſtancy.
                     YEt for our encouragement, note the laſt word of this verſe, to ſtand, wherein the ſecond branch of the end here propounded, is laid downe. To ſtand, in this place is a note of victory: it implieth that Satan notwithſtanding all his power, malice, ſubtilty, fury, ſedulity, with the like, cannot ouerthrow them that are well armed; but as Conquerers, when all the conflicts are ended, they ſhall ſtand ſafe &amp; ſure, euen the laſt in the field. It is here added as the iſſue of the former point, as if he ſhould haue ſaid; If manfully ye withſtand your enemies, at length ye ſhall ſtand as conquerers ouer them.
                        
                           Doct. 9. Conſtancy getteth conqueſt. The point here to be noted is this, that
Courage and conſtancy bringeth aſſured conqueſt and victorie. TheIn the reaſons of Doct. promiſes before mentioned intimate as much. ThatIam. 4. 7. which Saint Iames laieth downe as the iſſue of reſiſting the Diuell, is in effect the very ſame which is here laid downe. There it is ſaid; the Diuel will flie; here, we ſhall be able to ſtand: The Diuels flight &amp; our ſtanding do both imply a conqueſt. This was theIam. 5. 11. end which we know the Lord made at the end of Iohs patience. Hence it is that the Apoſtle&amp;v 12. counteth the man bleſſed that endureth tentation.
                     
                     Gods honour is otherwiſe impeached,Reaſons. if they which finiſh all be not crowned as cōquerers:1 Cor. 15. 19. of all men Chriſts ſouldiers are otherwiſe the moſt miſerable. Where then is the priuiledge of enduring? wherein lieth the difference betwixt thoſe which fight vnder Chriſts banner, and others, if not in preuailing? For the time Chriſts ſouldiers are cōmonly much more ſorely aſſaulted. But herein conſiſteth the difference,Heb. 13 5. that they are neuer forſaken,1 Cor. 10 13 that the Lord wil giue a good iſſue; that thogh they are broght vnto temptation, yet they are neuer caſt into it:Pſal. 125 3. 
                        For the rodde of the wicked ſhall not reſt on the lot of the righteous.
                     
                     In all conflicts haue an eye to this end;
                           Vſe. Looke to the iſſue. though your enemies be many and fierce, yet feare not, ye ſhall ſtand when they ſhall flie. Patiently waite, and faint not.Iſa. 28. 16. 
                        Hee that beleeueth ſhall not make haſte: for God who alone can end the fight, ſtandeth by: he ordereth all the aſſaults, for number, meaſure, kinde, continuance, and euery other circumſtance; and knoweth when and how to determine all. Therefore couragiouſly withſtand your enemies, that ye may victoriouſly ſtand. ForViciſſe eſt aduerſari

               Of the particular peeces of Armour.
               
                  THE FIRST PART.
                  The duty of ſuch as haue thoſe peeces.
                  
                     Epheſ. 6. 14.
                     Stand therefore hauing your loynes girt, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     §. 1. Of the Coherence.
                     
                        VNto the forenamed generall direction the Apoſtle addeth a particular exemplification of the ſame, diſtinctly ſetting downe certaine ſpeciall graces, whereby as with peeces of Armour we may ſtand faſt. This exexemplification is ſet forth in forme of an exhortation, wherein note,
                     1. The duty whereunto he exhorteth.
                     2. The meanes and manner how it is to be performed.
                     The duty is in this word
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        ſtand. Though this word be the ſame with that which immediatly before is ſet down, yet is it not of the ſame mood,That was of the infini
                           
                              ••

                           •
                        
                         a duty; and not one duty onely, but many duties: for it is a metaphoricall word taken from ſouldiers: and according to the diuers acceptation of the metaphor, it implieth diuers duties.
                  
                  
                     §. 2. Of a Souldiers ſtanding.
                     1. A Souldier-like courage: for as white-liuered, freſh-water, faint-hearted ſouldiers are ready vpon euery brunt to yeeld and run away: ſo valiant couragious ſouldiers ſtand ſtoutly againſt euery brunt; and will rather ſtand and die, then ſtirre and yeeld.
                     2 A ſetled abiding in ones proper place, or ſtanding in his rancke, neither ſtragling abroad, nor going into any others place. Experienced ſouldiers well know what a ſafegard it is to haue the rancks well kept, and therefore will not ſtep aſide.
                     3 A watchfulneſſe oppoſed to luskiſhneſſe and ſluggiſhneſſe: an heauy headed, idle, luskiſh ſouldier, is euer ready to lie downe, like a tired Oxe or Horſe; but a wiſe watchfull ſouldier ſtandeth to receiue his enemy whenſoeuer he maketh any aſſault.
                     4 Perſeuerance with armour ſtill on the backe: faint-hearted weake ſouldiers being loth long to beare the burden of their armour, will oft put it on and off: when a skirmiſh is paſt, off goes the armour, and ſo is laid aſide till they be forced againe to put it on: but old well experienced ſouldiers ſtand ſtill with their armour, looking for a freſh aſſault, and for more conflicts.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 3. Of Chriſtian valour.
                     1: VVE muſt be of a valorous couragious mind againſt all our enemies,
                           Duty 1. Stand ſtoutly ſtanding ſtoutly againſt them, and bidding defiance to them all, euen as

                     For they, though bold enough,Reaſons. yet are daunted with the ſtout ſtanding of Chriſts ſouldiers; but heartned with timorouſneſſe. Beſides, the courage of ſome valourous ſouldiers addeth ſpirits to all their fellowes.

                     2.
                           Duty 2. Abide in thy place. VVE muſt be careful to1 Cor. 7. 20. abide in the place where our Lord hath ſet vs. For this know, that we haue a doubling calling, one generall, as we are Chriſtians. The other particular, as we are diſtinguiſhed in Church,Ephe. 4. 1. Common-wealth, or Family. Accordingly theſe two points are to be obſerued.
                     
                         1 That we remaine ſtedfaſt in the true Church where the Lords banner is diſplaied: that we retaine our profeſſion, and ſtart not from it for gaine as2 Tim. 4. 10. 
                        Demas, or perſecution, as16. they which forſooke Paul. Stragling ſouldiers loſe the ſuccour of their Captaine, and helpe of their fellow ſouldiers. Such ſtraglers from Chriſts armies are ſeparatiſts, heretikes, time-ſeruers, and all reuolters.
                     2 That wee be conſcionable and diligent in the ſeuerall functions of our particular callings: as in the Common-wealth, Kings, Iudges, Iuſtices, all Magiſtrates, all Subiects alſo, all of any Office, Trade, &amp;c. In the Church, Miniſters, other Church Officers, and people. In the Family, Maſters and Seruants, Husbands and Wiues, Parents and Children. For this ende are particular duties preſcribed to particular functions in Gods word. Many weighty reaſons there be to vrge this.

                     3 The order wherein euery one is ſet, is the very beautie of the Church, and of the body of Chriſt: as the ſeuerall places of ſeuerall members, are the grace of a naturall body; Yea, this order is the ſtrength of the Church, as in an army: in this reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith, that the body of Chriſt isCha. 4. v. 16.

                           Vſe 
                         
                        Wee that are Chriſtians muſt rather ſeeke to defend our ſelues,
                        then annoy others. This was repreſented in that combate which our Lord fought with the diuell: ForMat. 4. 1. &amp;c. Chriſt was led aſide of the Spirit into the wilderneſſe, and being there, the tempter came firſt vnto him, and firſt ſet vpon him: here we ſee that there was a neceſſity to moue Chriſt to fight, and that in a double reſpect. Firſt, in that he was brought into the liſts. Secōdly, that being there, he was aſſaulted. In this fight Chriſt eſpecially aimed to defend himſelfe, and to repel his aduerſaries weapons. Therfore all his anſwers are framed directly according to Satans obiections. The like we may obſerue in his conflicts with the inſtruments of Satan, the Scribes, Phariſes, Herodians, &amp;c. as alſo in thoſe conflicts, which his Prophets Apoſtles, and other Saints haue had with Satan, and his inſtruments.
                     Hereby we ſee that we fight in a iuſt quarrell:
                           Reaſon Our quarrell is iuſt. for what iuſter cauſe can there be, then for a man to defend himſelfe, and his owne right?

                        Anſw. True, when they keepe men from their owne right, and make them recouer it by force. But we keepe nothing from Satan which is his due: he ſeeketh to get thoſe from Chriſt, whom Chriſt hath dearely bought, euen with the price of his owne blood. It is therefore a Diabolical property to raiſe vniuſt quarrels, and by force to ſeeke to wring from any that which he hath no right

                     ONe offenſiue weapon, the word of God,2 Obſ. Repell the enemy. which is a Sword, is put into our hands, ſo that iuſt occaſion being offered, we may and ought to do our beſt to repell and driue away the diuell, and his inſtruments.

Oft we are ſtirred vp to fight, wreſtle, ſtand, reſiſt, &amp;c. neuer perſwaded in the whole book of God to flie, that is, to yeeld the victory vnto Satan. We may wiſely auoid his temptations, and not yeeld to them, when by them he ſeekes to draw vs from the ſeruice of our Lord, to his ſlauery; and thus
1 Cor. 10. 14. we are commanded to to flie from idolatrie, to

But timorouſly to ceaſſe from reſiſting temptations, and withſtanding the Diuell, is dangerous to our ſelues, and diſhonourable to God: it maketh Satan euen inſult ouer God himſelfe,Diabolus non opus aliquod aliud operatur, niſivt ſubuertat: hic eſt cibus illius, hi

                     §. 5. Of the ſufficiency of our Armour.
                     IN this particular enumeration of theſe ſeuerall peeces,
                           Obſ. 4. Euery part fenced. I find a Chriſtian ſouldier armed from top to toe: for here is an Helmet for his head and face: a Breſtplate, together with the taſſets and cuſhes, from necke to middle, and from thence to the knees: a Girdle to knit them together; greaues from knees to the ſoles of the feet; a Sword for the right hand, and a Shield for the left. Well therefore might the Apoſtle terme it whole Armour.
                     
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 So whole and compleate is this Armour,
 as we need ſeek for no other to adde to it, or to couer it ouer: As it is madneſſe to reiect this, and truſt to the clout and paper armour of Papiſts and wordlings: ſo it is childiſhneſſe and meere folly to couer this whole Armour ouer with any other, and ſo needleſly clog the ſoule: yea it is derogatory to Gods honour and wiſedome, and a degree of preſumption. Such are they as acknowledge and beleeue that the word of God is perfect, and yet thinke it no harme to haue humane traditions added thereto: or that Chriſt onely is able to ſaue, and yet the helpe of Saints to doe no harme: or that faith onely is ſufficient for iuſtification, and yet no hurt to ioyne workes alſo with faith, in the office of iuſtifying a ſinner, &amp;c.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 Let our care be to be armed with this whole Armour,
 and euery peece of it, and ſo we may well content our ſelues therewith, boldly may we defie our enemies hauing it on, and not feare what they can do vnto vs. Theſe vſes haue bene largely handled, ſo as I need not now further inſiſt vpon them.
                  
               
               
                  
                  THE THIRD PART.
                  Girdle of Truth.
                  
                     Epheſ: 6. 14.
                     Hauing your loynes girt about with Truth.
                  
                  
                     §. 1. Of the diuers kinds of Truth.
                     
                        THe firſt peece of ſpirituall Armour heere in order ſet downe by the Apoſtle, is Truth. In handling whereof I will ſhew, firſt what Truth is heere meant. Secondly, how fitly it is compared to a Girdle: Thirdly, what account is to be made thereof. Fourthly, what wyles the diuell hath to wreſt it from vs:
                     For the firſt, There is in man a foure-fold truth.
                     1. Of iudgment.Foure kinds of truth. Truth of iudgement. 2. Of heart. 3. Of ſpeech. 4. Of action.
                     Truth of iudgement is, when a mans iudgement agreeeth with Gods word, which is the touch-ſtone of Truth: ſo as the principles of that Religion which he profeſſeth, and his opinion concerning the ſame, are grounded theron, and may be warranted thereby. When the vnderſtanding of man, being enlightned by Gods Spirit, and informed by his word, remaineth ſetled and eſtabliſhed in that doctrine which the word of God teacheth, then is there Truth in his iudgement: this Truth was it for which2. Pet. 1. 12. Saint Peter commended the diſtreſſed Iewes to whom he wrote, and whichchap. 4. v. 15 Saint Paul exhorteth the Epheſians to follow. This is oppoſed to errour.
                     
                     Truth of heart is the ſingleneſſe and ſincerity thereof,2. Truth of heart.
                         whereby a man ſeeketh to approue himſelfe vnto God the ſearcher of all hearts, and to be accepted of him:Pſal. 51. 6. this is that truth in the inward affection which God loueth, and
Iſai. 38. 3. wherewith Hezekiah comforted himſelfe, yea which he pleaded before the Lord, when he had receiued a ſentence of death. This is oppoſed to hypocriſie.
                     
                     Truth of ſpeech is an agreement of the word of a mans mouth both with his mind,3 Truth of ſpeech. and alſo with the matter which he vttereth. This is it, whereunto we are exhorted,
Epheſ. 4. verſ. 25. ſpeake the truth. AndRom. 9. 1. which the Apoſtle oft affirmeth of himſelfe. This is oppoſed to lying,
                        1 Tam. 2. 7. when a man ſpeaketh againſt his mind and conſcience: and to falſhood, when a man ſpeaketh contrary to the thing it ſelfe.
                     Truth of action,4 Truth of action. is a plaine, faithfull, and honeſt dealing in all things, whether wee haue to doe with God, or man; when men neither make ſhew of doing that which indeed they doe not, or of doing it otherwiſe then they doe:Ioh. 1. 47. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         this truth was in Nathaniel, in which reſpect Chriſt called him an Iſraelites in truth. This is oppoſed to diſsimulation and deceit.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 5. What kind of Truth is here meant.
                     SOme apply the Truth here mentioned, to doctrine and religion, as if only the ſoundnes of it were meant: others reſtraine it to the vprightneſſe and ſincerity of our hearts and affections: others vnderſtand it of the truth of our words and ſpeeches: and others expound it of the purity and innocency of our practiſe and carriage.
                     But whoſoeuer exclude any of theſe forenamed branches of truth, come (as I take it) ſhort of the Apoſtles meaning; all of them muſt concurre to make vp the ſtrength and beauty of this Girdle. For truth is a generall propertie,Truth as ſalt. which as ſalt ſeaſoneth euery thing, and maketh it ſauory to God and man: the whole lumpe muſt be leauened with it, I meane the whole man throughout, his opinion, his affection, his communication, his conuerſation.
                     1 Truth of iudgement is the ground of all the reſt:Truth in iudgement the foundation to the reſt. for though our hearts be neuer ſo ſincere, our ſpeeches neuer ſo true, our actions neuer ſo plaine, yet if in iudgement we be miſled, all is but as ſtraw and ſtubble, which when it commeth to the fire of tryall, will ſoone be conſumed. It ſeemeth that before Paul was inſtructed in the truth of the Goſpel, he had a kind of truth in his heart, for heAct. 22. 3. 
                        was zealous towards God; yea alſo in his ſpeeches and actions, forPhil. 3. 6. 
                        he was vnrebukeable concerning the righteouſneſſe which is the Law: yea,Act. 26. 9. 
                        he thought in himſelfe he ought to doe what he did: he had not a double heart, a double tongue; he pretended not what he neuer intended; yet becauſe he wanted truth in iudgement, all was butPhil. 3. 8. droſſe, and loſſe vnto him.
                     2 To truth of iudgment,To truth of iudgement, adde truth of heart. muſt truth of heart be added, or els notwithſtanding the ſoundneſſe of doctrine which we profeſſe, we make our ſelues odious and abominable to God: for God gaue man but one ſingle ſimple heart: if any hauePſal. 12. 2. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        an heart, and an heart, the Diuell hath giuen him a double heart, it is no part of Gods Image, God will not acknowledge it. Iudas knew the truth of Religion, and preached it as wel as the other diſciples, but wanting truth in his other parts, what good got he thereby, but the witneſſe of his conſcience againſt himſelfe?
                     3 But what if a man which profeſſeth the true Religion,Where truth of heart is, there is truth of ſpeech and action. thinke he hath a ſingle heart, and yet bee giuen to lying, and to deale deceitfully? Surely hee diſgraceth his profeſſion, and giueth iuſt cauſe of ſuſpition, that hee hath no honeſt heart: for the heart is as a fountaine. Out of the abundance of the heart, proceed a mans words and actions: yea the heart is as a Queene, and hath a command of a mans tongue, and of al his outward parts: ſo that if there be truth in it, there will be truth in all the other parts: ſincerity in the heart will keepe the tongue from lying, and the whole carriage of a man from diſſimulation and deceit. We ſee then that of neceſſity all theſe foure branches of truth muſt be ioyned together to make vp this girdle.
                  
                  
                     §. 3. What kind of Girdle is here meant.
                     
                        
                           Point 11 THe next point is,
how fitly Truth is compared to a Girdle. concerning the metaphor, and the fit application of this grace of truth. This ſpeech of

                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        girding the loynes, is in Scripture taken in a double ſence: one for truſſing vp a mans garments, the other for cloſe and faſt tying his harneſſe together: in the former ſence the metaphor is taken from trauellers or runners: for in thoſe countries they were wont to weare long aſide garments, which if they were not tucked vp, they would hang dangling about the heels of ſuch as trauelled or runne a race, and ſo be a great hinderance vnto them. In this ſence this metaphor is1 King. 18. 46 oft vſed,2 King 4, 29. and therby Gods people were taughtExod. 12. 11. to remoue all impediments in their Chriſtian courſe and iourney,Luke 12. 35. and to be as well prepared as they could be to performe the worke of the Lord. In the latter ſence the metaphor is taken from ſouldiers, who are wont to knit their Armour cloſe and faſt vnto them, and ſo tye their loynes hard, partly to keepe their Armour from looſing and ſhaking, and partly to keepe their body ſteddy. Iob. 38, 3. &amp; 40. 2.In this ſence the Lord ſaid to Iob;
                        Iob 38. 3. &amp; 40. 2. 
                        Gird vp thy loines like a man: That laſt phrase
Like a man, ſheweth that hee ſpeaketh to him as vnto a ſouldier, whom hee would haue to ſtand ſtedfaſt, and to hearken vnto him.
                     Here it is to be taken in this latter ſence, and ſignifieth a ſouldier-like girding of the loines: for which purpoſe, they who weare armour, vſe to haue a ſtrong faire girdle, commonly called a belt, whereby they knit faſt together▪ and cloſe vnto their middle the vpper and lower peeces of their armour, as their breſt-plate, and their taſſets and cuſhes. Theſe belts as they were ſtrong, ſo they were ſet with ſtuddes, being faire and large. There is a double vſe of them: one to keepe the ſeuerall peeces of armour faſt and cloſe together, and to hold the loines of a man firme, and ſteddy, that he might be able to ſtand the ſurer, and hold out the longer. The other to couer the ioints of the armour, that they might not be ſeene. The firſt vſe was for ſtrength: the ſecond for ornament.
                  
                  
                     §. 4. Wherein a girdle is reſembled to truth.
                     THus truth is both an ornament to a Chriſtian ſouldier,Quid ſpecioſius ipſ averitate ad quam omnis ſpectator peruenire ſe cupere confitetur, &amp;c. Aug. de ver. Rel. cap.

                           9 and alſo an excellent meanes of ſtrength to vphold him. For it doth both grace and honour him before God and man; and alſo faſt holdeth together other graces of Gods Spirit, eſpecially in temptation, when they are moſt ſhaken, and ſo vpholdeth him. This will more euidently appeare by the particular branches of truth before mentioned.
                     1 What greater ornament and beauty to religion,Truth the beſt grace to religion. then ſoundneſſe and euidence of truth? This is the very glorie and crowne thereof: all other vaine gloſſes, as antiqui

                     So for ſtrength,And the greateſt ſtrength. Simil.
                         what can better ſettle and eſtabliſh the iudgement of a man then truth? Great is truth, and preuaileth. It is like a ſharpe ſword in a weake mans hand, which is able to pierce deepe though there bee but ſmall ſtrength to thruſt it.Veritas vinci non poteſt, multitudine hoſtiū non terretur. Hicron. Truth cannot be ouercome, neither is daunted with the multitude of enemies. This is it which hath made Martyrs in all ages to ſtand to their profeſſion vnto death, and to ſeale it with their blood, rather then ſtart from it; yea, though many of them were illiterate men and weake weomen.
                     The like may be ſaid of the other branches of truth:Truth is a come lines in euery thing. an vpright and ſincere heart maketh a man amiable before God himſelfe.1 Kin 15. 3. 4. 5. 
                        Dauid being a man of a ſingle heart, is termed,Acts 13. 22.

                        what account is to bee made of truth. who exhorteth to buy the truth, and not ſell it. This aduice concerneth two ſorts of men, 1. Such as haue it not: they muſt labour to get it: 2. Such as haue it, they muſt hold it faſt. That this direction may bee the better applied, wee are well to ſearch whether we haue this girdle of verity or no. Fitly may I apply that to truth, which2 Cor. 13. 5. the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of faith;
Examine your ſelues whether yee haue truth, proue your ſelues. There is no grace which maketh a more ſenſible difference betwixt the children of God and of the Diuel, then truth. In this examination we muſt proceed in order.
                  
                  
                     §. 6. How triall of truth may be made.
                     1. TRiall is to bee made of the truth of our iudgement:1. Search what truth in iudgement. whether the religion which we profeſſe, and all the principles thereof be aſſuredly ſound and true. To this tendeth1 Theſ. 5. 21 that exhortation of Saint Paul, Trie all things; and1 Ioh 4. 1. that of Saint Iohn, Trie the ſpirits. For this end, the direction giuen by Chriſt (Ioh. 5. 39. 
                        Search the Scriptures) is to be obſerued and followed,Acts 17. 11. as it was by the men of
Berea: for the Scriptures areIam. 1. 18. the word of truth, and2 Tim. 3. 16. the voice of God, the higheſt and chiefeſt Iudge: a moſt perfect, ſufficient, impartiall Iudge. They who make any other Iudge may ſoone be deceiued.
                     
                         Here ſee what wrong Popiſh guides doe to their followers, in keeping from them this touch-ſtone of truth. See what ideots they bee who thinke it ſufficient to beleeue as the Church doth. Such are they among vs, whoſe onely ground of faith is the common receiued Doctrine, be it true or falſe. No maruell they be ſoone ſhaken and remoued: they want this girdle of truth, which ſhould ſtrengthen them.
                     2 If wee find truth ſeated in our vnderſtanding,2 Search what truth in heart. then are we further to obſerue whether like the ointment powred on Aarons head;Pſal. 133. 2, 3. and the dew that fell on the mountaines of Sion, it deſcend from the head to the heart: whether the heart be vpright before God or no. It appeareth that Dauid thorowly ſearched his heart for the truth thereof,Pſal. 26. 1. or elſe durſt he not with ſuch boldneſſe and confidence haue referred it to Gods triall:Ier. 17. 9. the like I might inſtance in Iob, Hezechiah, Paul, and many others. Great neede there is of thorow trying the heart: for it is deceitfull aboue all things, and that not onely to others who cannot diſcerne the ſecrets thereof, but alſo to men themſelues, if at leaſt they diue not into the bottom of it. Some be ſuch groſſe hypocrites, that they cannot but in their hearts condemne themſelues, asActs 5. 3. 9. 
                        Ananias and Saphira: others ſo ſimple as they beguile themſelues,Mat. 26. 33. like Peter and the other Diſciples. In all ages many haue thought better of the integrity of their heart, then by proofe and euent it hath fallen out to be. The beſt triall of our heart will bee by our diſpoſition when wee are alone, or when wee can conceale our thoughts and cogitations from all men, yea, euen from the very ſuſpition and coniecture of men: if then they be vpright, and therefore vpright, becauſe we deſire to approue our ſelues to God,Gen. 39. 9. as Ioſeph, then may we be aſſured there is truth in them.
                     
                         3 From the heart which is a fountaine,3. Search what truth in ſpeech and action. we are to proceede to the ſtreames thereof, our ſpeeches and actions; and ſearch whether from this cleare ſpring there flow forth cleare waters, and ſo ſee what correſpondency there is betwixt them. Now here we are not onely to obſerue whether our ſpeeches doe agree with our knowledge of the thing we vtter, and with euidence of the thing it ſelfe, or whether our actions be plaine, or fraudulent and deceitfull; but alſo whether that true and good communication which we vtter, and thoſe true and honeſt actions which we performe, doe comeLuk. 6. 45. from the good treaſure of a true heart. For our helpe in this triall, note theſe few directions.
                  
                  
                     §. 7. Directions for triall of truth in ſpeech and action.
                     1. VVHat is the ground of truth in our words and actions?1. The ground of truth. what moueth vs thereunto? whether popular applauſe (Mat. 23. 5. as the Sribes and Phariſes, who did all to be ſeene of men,
                        Ioh. 12. 43. 
                        for they loued the praiſe of men more then of God) or credit and eſtimation (as1 Sam. 15. 30 
                        Saul) or profit (asGen. 34. 23. the Schechemites) or reſpect to ſome men (as2 Chr. 24. 2. 17. 
                        Ioaſh and his people) or deſire of quiet and auoiding trouble, (asEſt. 8. 17. 
                        they which became Iewes in Mordecaies time) or company and example of others, (asActs 5▪ 1. 
                        Ananias and Saphira) or intent to worke ſome miſchiefe, (as1 Kin. 21 9. 
                        Iezabel, andIer. 41. 6. 
                        Iſhmael. Theſe and ſuch other by-reſpects being the ground and cauſe of our actions, doe plainely argue that there is no ſound truth in them.
                     2 What is the extent of that truth we make ſhew of?2. The extent of truth. whether it be in all things.
                        Heb. 13. 18. This was the proofe of the Apoſtles good conſcience: for truth is a leuen1 Cor. 5. 6. which ſeaſoneth the whole lumpe. So as they which at ſometimes, and in ſome things are watchfull ouer their words and actions, but careleſſe at other times in other things, want this leuen of truth, asMas. 6. 20. 
                        Herod.
                     
                     3 What the things are wherein wee are moſt ſtrictt?3. The obiect of truth. whether they be matters of greateſt weight and moment? They who pretend much truth in ſmal and light matters, and are careleſſe and diſſolute in great and weighty matters, haue no ſound truth in them.Mat. 23. 23. Such were the Scribes and Phariſes.
                     
                     4 What order we obſerue?4. The order of ſhewing truth. whether firſt we beginne with our ſelues, and looke to our owne ſpeeches and actions.
Mat. 23. 4. Many will be more forward and zealous in ſtirring vp others to all manner of truth, then themſelues: yea, they will checke others for failing in ſuch things wherein themſelues are moſt faulty: ſurely there is no ſound truth in ſuch.Mat. 7. 3. Chriſt maketh this a note of hypocriſie.
                  
                  
                     §. 8. Of buying truth.
                     THus are wee to ſearch our ſelues thorowout, and if vpon this ſearch wee cannot find that wee haue this girdle of verity, then we muſt obſerue the firſt part of the Wiſemans aduice,How to buy truth. 
                        Buy the truth, that is, vſe all the meanes which poſſibly we can, for attaining vnto, and poſſeſſing it: yea, though it be with a departing from, and forſaking of many things which ſeemed profitable and pleaſant vnto vs, becauſe they and truth could not well ſtand together. The Metaphor of buying implieth a letting goe of ſome things, for the attaining of other things. Excellentlie is this ſet forth vnto vs by twoMat. 13. 44, 45. parables which Chriſt vttered, one of a man that bought a treaſure, and another of a Merchant that bought a pearle. Truth is a rich treaſure, and a precious pearle: if the worth of it, and the need which we haue of it, were well knowne, I doubt not but eaſily wee ſhould bee perſwaded to part with much for the getting of it.Veritas propter ſeipſam diligenda eſt, Aug. in Gal. So excellent it is, that for it ſelfe it is to be loued.
                  
                  
                     §. 9. Motiues to buy Truth.
                     I Will therefore firſt lay downe ſome motiues to ſtirre vp in vs a deſire of truth, and then ſome directions, to inſtruct vs how to get it.
                     For the firſt, note the excellency: 2. The neceſſity: 3. The benefits of truth.
                     1 Excellent muſt that needs be,The excellē
                           cy of truth. which maketh vs like to God: but nothing can make vs more like to him then truth: for he is thePſal. 31. 5 
                        Lord God of truth,
                        Ioh. 14. 6. his Sonne is truth,
Ioh. 14. 17 his holy Spirit the Spirit of truth,
                        Iam. 1. 18. his word, the word of truth;
                        Pſal. 11. 9. his promiſes, commandements, iudgements, waies, workes, all truth. Herein doe the glorious Angels and Saints reſemble God,Mat. 6. 10. whom to imitate is an excellent thing:Ioh. 8. 4. moſt contrary is the Diuell, and all that beare his image.
                     Beſides, Truth is a kind of perfection in all Chriſtian graces; yea,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . the greateſt perfection that we can attaine vnto in this life,Gen. 6. 9. &amp; 17. 1. one and the ſame word in Hebrew, ſignifieth both integrity or vprightneſſe and perfection, ſo as ſome tranſlate it vpright, ſome perfect. In regard of this quality,Pſal. 26. 1. we may appeale to Gods iudgement, but not in any other kind of perfection,

                           ſa. 38. 3. whether of degrees, parts, meaſure, or the like, ſo that in this reſpect it hath an excellency aboue all other graces.
                     2 So needfull it is and neceſſary,2. The neceſſity of truth. as without it no other grace can be of any vſe. Faith, hope, loue, &amp; all other graces, are as corrupt and putrified meate without it▪
                         Therefore the Scripture commendeth2 Tim. 1. 5. 
                        faith vnfained,
                        Rom. 12. 9. 
                        loue without diſsimulation,

                        wiſedome without hypocriſie, &amp;c. Yea, alſo lippes vnfained, innocent hands, &amp;c.
                     
                     No knowledge,Mat. 5. 20. &amp; 6. 2. &amp; 23. 14. no righteouſneſſe, no good thing can ſtand an hypocrite in any ſteed. What good got Saul, Iudas, Ananias and Saphira, Simon Magus, and ſuch other hypocrites,Hypocritae ab inſpectore cordis Deo mercedem non capiunt, niſi fallaciae ſupplicium. Auguſt. de ſerm. Dom. in morte. lib. 2. by all thoſe ſeeming excellent gifts, which they made ſhew of? all they did was odious before God: Therefore notwithſtanding the Phariſes prayed oft, gaue much almes, faſted oft, duly payed their tithes, with the like; yet Chriſt denounceth many woes againſt them,
Mat. 23. Hypocrites receiue no reward of God the ſearcher of hearts, but the puniſhment of deceit.
                     3 Such is the benefit of truth,3. The benefit of truth. that the leaſt meaſure of grace ſeaſoned with it is acceptable to God, and in that reſpect very profitable to vs. It is noted of thoſe which in Hezechias time came out of Ephraim, and other tribes of Iſrael, vnto Ieruſalem to keep the Paſſeouer,2 Chr. 30. 18, 19, 20. that they had not clen
                           •
                        ed themſelues according to the Law, whereby they prouoked the Lord to inflict ſome iudgement vpon them: but Hezekiah putting the Lord in mind how
they came with their whole heart to ſeeke the God of their Fathers, the Lord healed them. Well mightPſal. 119. 1. 
                        Dauid pronounce the vpright bleſſed, for asPſal. 51. 6.

                        the vpright are his delight, andPſal. 84. 11. hee hath promiſed to withhold no good thing from them.
                     Thus we ſee what good reaſon we haue to buy truth. Obſerue now how it may be gotten.
                  
                  
                     §: 10. Meanes to get truth.
                     FOr truth of iudgement,How truth in iudgement is gotten. wee muſt reſort to the place where it may be had, that is the true Church,1 Tim. 3. 15. 
                        the pillas and ground of Truth. In it is the fountaine of Truth, the holy Scriptures: in it flow forth the ſtreames of Truth, by the Miniſtery of the Word. Be thou one of the members of the true Church, ſo ſhalt thou haue a right thereunto: Search the Scripture, frequent the Miniſtery of the Word, ſo ſhalt thou find Truth. Rather then goe without it, let goe honour, wealth, pleaſures, eaſe, and all thy naturall and carnall luſts: let goe all. Baul had ſurely a good mind to buy the Truth forPhil. 3. 8. 
                        he counted all things loſſe for the excellent knowledge of Chriſt.
                     
                     For truth in heart,How truth in heart, ſpeech and carriage is gotten. ſpeech and carriage, remember that thou ſtandeſt alwayes in the preſence of God, and that thou haſt to doe with him whether thou art alone, or in company, doing any duty that appertaineth to God or man; and in reſpect hereof, let thy care bee to approue thy ſelfe to God: Thus ſhalt thou get Truth. For marke the charge which God himſelfe gaue to Abraham,
                        Gen. 17. 1. 
                        Walke before me, and be vpright. The former part of this charge, is a cauſe of the latter: the latter a fruit and euidence of the former,Gen. 39. 9 
                        Ioſeph had well acquainted himſelfe with Gods preſence, which made him ſo honeſt and vpright.
                     This is it which maketh men ſuch diſſemblers in their words and actions, that either they know not Gods preſence in euery place, or beleeue it not, or thinke not of it, or regard it not. Mans preſence maketh many be faithfull, iuſt, honeſt, &amp;c. Surely Gods preſence muſt needs worke much more, if it were duely weighed, or elſe men haue Atheiſticall hearts. Let vs ſet God alwayes before vs, and depart with any thing rather then offend him, and thus ſhall we come to be vpright.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 11. Of keeping Truth.
                     AFter that Truth is gotten,Sell not truth. our next care muſt bee faſt to hold it, and thereby manifeſt that great account which we make of it. Sell it not (ſaith the Wiſe man) by no meanes vpon any condition, for any reſpect let it go: for then2 Pet. 2. 20, &amp;c. it had bin better for vs neuer to haue had it. All the good we reape by verity and integrity, after it is loſt, is this, that another day it will riſe vp in iudgement, and be an heauy witneſſe againſt vs. Some men make ſuch account of ſome Iewels they haue, that no preferment, no fauour, no wealth, no office, nothing can purchaſe them; and yet it may bee that their iewels are not worth the price which is offred for them. Should not we much more eſteeme of Truth, for which no ſufficient price can be giuen? The holy Confeſſors and Martyrs in all ages haue well knowne the value of this iewell, and in that reſpect preferred it before their liuings and liues: they would not let go Truth of doctrine:Gen. 39. 9. 
                        Ioſeph would not let goe Truth of heart and action, for loue nor feare.
                  
                  
                     §. 12. How truth of doctrine is aſſaulted.
                     THis latter point of faſt-holding and ſafe keeping
Truth,
                        IIII. Point. Satans wyles to wreſt truth from vs. is the rather to be regarded, becauſe the Diuell and his inſtruments (not ignorant, that if this Girdle be wanting, all other peeces of Armour will ſtand vs in no ſtead) haue beene in all former ages, and ſtill are buſie to get it away frō vs, ſometimes by faire enticements &amp; allurements to draw vs from truth of doctrine: on the one ſide are brought many plauſible arguments, agreeable to the naturall humour and reaſon of man, (ſuch are moſt of theargumēts which Papiſts vſe;) on the other ſide much trouble &amp; great perſecution is raiſed. If they c
                           •
                        not cleane ouerthrow Truth, yet they will do what they can to adulterate it: witneſſe the Prophets and Apoſtles times, and euery age euer ſince: I would our age and Countrey were free from it. Behold how buſie Popiſh Ieſuites, Prieſts and Fryers are: what would they not giue? what would they not doe, to diſpoſſeſſe vs of the Truth of Religion?
                  
                  
                     §. 13. How ſincerity is aſſaulted.
                     SO likewiſe for ſincerity, how doe profane worldlings ſeeke to wreſt it from vs? endeuouring to make vs odious to all, becauſe we will not yeeld to them. Theſe are as ſpitefully bent againſt vs for ſincerity, Truth and honeſty in our heart, words and actions, as Papiſts are for verity and ſoundneſſe of doctrine. For ſome hate thoſe that are honeſt and vpright (as1 Kin. 22. 8. 
                        Ahab hated Micaiah;) ſome ſcoffe at them (asGen. 21. 9. 
                        Iſmael at Iſaac,) ſaying,
plaine dealing is a iewell,
                        A curſed prouerbe. 
                        and he that vſeth it will die a begger. Yea they will not ſticke to brand them with the odious termes of hypocriſie and diſſimulation, though of all ſort of people they are fartheſt from it: eſpecially, if God ſuffer any affliction to fall on them, (asIob 2. 6, &amp; 9. on his ſeruant
Iob) then with e 
                        Iobs wife and friends, they will be ready to vpbraid vnto them their integrity and vprightneſſe, as if all had beene onely in ſhew to bleare mens eyes. But if any that indeed with an hollow heart haue made profeſſion, doe fall away, and ſo bee diſcouered (as Iudas, Ananias, Demas, and ſuch other) their examples ſhall bee caſt in the teeth of the moſt vpright.
                     
                         And if, notwithſtanding all this, they ſhall remaine conſtant (as Iob did) and not ſuffer their innocency and integrity to bee outfaced,Iob 27. 5. then will they obiect againſt them the cenſure of other men, and ſay of them, How ſoeuer ye thinke of your ſelues, yet others, and thoſe good men too, thinke not ſo well of you: if ye were wiſe, you would giue more credit to other mens iudgement, then to your owne: for men are blind and partiall in iudging themſelues.
                     
                     Many by theſe and ſuch like diſcouragements haue beene moued to make no account of Truth, but to leaue it to ſuch as better eſteeme it them they: Others, to caſt it away, and to yeeld to the times, both for Religion and conuerſation, ſhewing themſelues as ſuperſtitious or profane as the worſt. I will therefore as an antidote againſt thoſe poyſonous obiections, diſcouer the vanitie of them, and ſhew how theſe wyles may be auoided.

THe danger which they alledge, is either in regard of conſpiracies, treaſons and inſurrections which Princes and Gouernous are ſubiect vnto, if they be too ſtiffe in maintaining truth of Religion: or perſecutions which ſubiects are like to fall into, if they be too reſolute in profeſſing the Truth.

                        Obiect. 1. The Diuell ſuggeſteth to many, that it is impoſſible alwayes to keepe the heart vpright: and that if there be a little failing, the conſcience is ſo troubled, as it can hardly (if at all) be quieted: and thereupon inferreth, that it is beſt not at all to regard truth of heart.
                     
                        Anſw.
                        Truth keepeth from deſpaire. There can be no better, no more ſoueraigne a preſeruatiue againſt trouble of conſcience then truth of heart.Iob 27. 5, 6. This kept Iob from deſpaire: this made Hezekiah bold.Iſai. 38. 3. Truth of heart is a ſtrong prop to a man in the middeſt of his manifold infirmities: for it is impoſſible to keepe the heart free from all corruption, but yet there may be truth in heart. Euery corruption, though it argue imperfection, yet it argues not hypocriſie, if it ſteale into the heart againſt our honeſt purpoſe, and againſt our earneſt deſire, and being diſcerned, cauſeth godly ſorrow, and Chriſtian watchfulneſſe, both in purging the heart of that which is intred in, and alſo in keeping it that the like enter not in againe. But where there is no truth of heart, it is vtterly impoſſible that there ſhould bee any ſound comfort. If ſuch a mans conſcience be euer troubled, it will be ouerwhelmed and drowned in deſpaire.

                        Anſw.
                        Truth is eaſie and ſweet. It ſeemeth weariſome onely to thoſe who neuer felt it, neuer knew it. I may ſay of it, asMat. 11. 30. Chriſt of his yoke, It is eaſie and light. Yea, it is ſweet and pleaſant to him that indeed taſted of it. As for thoſe which haue fallen, they neuer had a graine of Truth in their hearts: all the ſhew they made, was only a ſhew:Mat. 13. 21. They fell becauſe they had no Truth in them. Had they beene vpright,1 Toh. 2. 19. they would haue continued ſo,Pſal. 37. 37. for marke the vp right man: the end of that man is peace.

Heb. 12. 5, 6. but of his loue, when they are laid vpon his children. The vpright haue many iudgements inflicted on them for proofe of their vprightneſſe, (asIob 1. 11, 12. 
                        Iob) and therefore for their good, and for their glory, yea alſo for the glory of God.

                        Anſw.
                        Truth beſt diſcouered by a mans owne heart. No other man can ſo well diſcerne the Truth of heart, as a mans owne ſelfe:1 Cor. 2. 11. 
                        For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſaue the ſpirit of a man which is in him? As other men may iudge an hypocrite to bee vpright, when the hypocrite in his own conſcience knoweth himſelfe to be ſo: ſo they may iudge an vpright man to be an hypocrite. But another mans iudgement cannot make the hypocrite to be vpright: why then ſhould it make an vpright man an hypocrite? the hypocrites conſcience condemneth him, though all the world acquite him: and the vpright mans conſcience will vphold him, as Iobs did, though all the world condemne him.1 Ioh. 3. 11. 
                        Beleued, if our heart condemne vs not, then haue we boldneſſe towards God. ForRom. 14. 4. euery one ſtandeth or falleth to his owne maſter.

                        Obiect. 1. Truth is an hinderance, in that it keepeth men from much gaine: for ſome ſay, there is no liuing without lying, and vſing the common ſecrets of Trades.
                     
                        Anſw.
                        Gaine gotby deceit is no gaine. It were much better to want gaine, then to get it by any deceit of word or deed.Pro. 20. 17. 
                        The bread of deceit is ſweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth ſhall be filled with grauell:

                     But this pretext of hinderance is a meere pretext,Truth the beſt meanes of gaines vtterly falſe: for there is not a more ſure meanes of gaine then truth in word and deed: and that in a double reſpect.

                        the vpright are laughed to ſcorne: they are a by-word in euery mans mouth, yea, they are trodden vnder euery ones feete,d they are made a prey.
                     
                     
                        Anſw. All theſe wee may put as flowers into our garland of glory, and reioice in them, as we heard of perſecution: forLuk. 6. 22. Chriſt maketh them kinds of perſecution.
                     Thus we ſee that Truth notwithſtanding all that can be obiected againſt it,Veritas multis impugnantibus ſuſcitatur, &amp; creſcit. Chryſo. hom. 4. de laud Pauli. is worth the keeping: all the cauils of the Diuell and his inſtrument are of no force to make vs little regard this girdle of verity, or lightly to let it goe: yea, ſuch is the vertue of Truth, that like the Palme tree, the more it is preſſed downe, the more it groweth.
                  
                  
                     §. 22. Of holding truth more ſtedfaſtly for oppoſition.
                     LEt vs doe with this and other peeces of ſpirituall Armour, as men doe with their cloakes which couer their bodies: if the wind blow hard againſt them, they will ſo much the faſter and cloſer hold their cloakes. Euen ſo, the more Satan ſtriueth to depriue vs of our ſpirituall robes, the more carefull and ſtedfaſt ought wee to be in keeping them.
                     
                         In particular for this girdle of verity, it is ſo much the more highly to be accounted of by vs, who are the Lords faithfull ſouldiers, by how much the leſſe reckoning is made thereof by the greater number of people.
                     In theſe daies all is for ſhew,What little regard of truth moſt haue. little or nothing in truth. As building, wares, apparell, and the like, are all of the ſleighteſt ſtuffe, but with the faireſt gloſſe and ſhew that may be; ſo our religion and all things elſe. That religion which outwardly is moſt glorious and pompous, is of moſt imbraced, as being the beſt; whereby it commeth to paſſe that Popery hath gotten ſuch liking of many. Who almoſt is carefull to ſet himſelfe alwaies in Gods preſence, and asGen. 5. 22 
                        Enoch to walke with him? Many who ſeeme very deuout at Church, ſeldome or neuer haue any religious exerciſe at home in their Family, much leſſe in their cloſets before God. For their words, they ſhall be as faire as may be before a mans face, but full of falſehood, yea, moſt bitter and virulent behind a mans backe. And for actions, all are to bleare the purblind eyes of men. All the care is to keepe credit with men: wherein while men thinke to deceiue others, they doe moſt of all deceiue themſelues, and their owne poore ſoules, which ſhall another day anſwere for this deceit.

                        THe ſecond peece of our Spirituall Armour is Righteouſneſſe,
                        Veritas vbiq, mater eſt ſanctitatis, Chrylo. hom. 19. in Pſa. 118. compared to a breſt-plate. Fitly is this inferred vpon the former: for truth is the mother of righteouſneſſe, they cannot be ſeuered. In handling this point, I will ſhew, firſt, what righteouſneſſe is. Secondly, how fitly it is compared to a breſt-plate. Thirdly, how this breſt-plate is put and kept on. Fourthly, what is the benefit of it Fiftly, what are the wiles of the Diuell to keepe vs from it.
                     
                        
                           Point 1 Righteouſneſſe is our conformity vnto Gods Law,
what righteouſnes is. an holy quality wrought in vs by Gods Spirit, whereby we endeauour to ſquare and frame all our thoughts, words, and actions, vnto the righteous rule of the Law of God. It is that which wee commonly call

                        Iuſtice, a vertue whereby is giuen to euery one their due, whether it be to God or man. Righteouſneſſe is often reſtrained to that part of iuſtice, which reſpecteth man, and ſo is the ſumme of the ſecond Table; but then either ſome other word is ioined with it, which hath reference to God, as Holineſſe, Luke 1. 75: or elſe ſome circumſtance of the place reſtraineth it to man, as Deut. 24. 13. But otherwiſe, when there is no other word or circumſtance which reſtraineth it, then it extendeth it ſelfe to the whole Law, as here.
                     The Law of God is a right and perfect rule, and declareth what is due to God and man, ſo that a conformity thereunto, is righteouſneſſe.

                        For Moſes thus deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe which is of the Law, that the man, (euen the man himſelfe, in and by himſelfe) which doth thoſe things (euen all thoſe things which are written in the Law, according to the vttermoſt extent of them) ſhall liue thereby: but

                         The righteouſneſſe of faith is Chriſt himſelfe,Righteouſneſ of faith. with his righteouſnes imputed to vs, and by faith receiued of vs▪ in which reſpectRom. 10. 4. expounded. Chriſt is ſaid to be the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth. The end of the Law is to iuſtifie and ſaue thoſe which fulfill it. Now we, by reaſon of the fleſh dwelling in vs, cannot fulfill it. Chriſt therefore ſubiected himſelfe thereto, he perfectly fulfilled it. To them which beleeue, his perfect righteouſneſſe is imputed; ſo as they are iuſtified and ſaued thereby. Thus is Chriſt the end of the Law, and that, which by the Law was exacted of our owne perſons, by the Goſpell is accepted for vs in Chriſt, who performed it. This Righteouſneſſe of Faith is compriſed vnder the fourth peece of Spirituall Armour, verſe 16. Here therefore is eſpecially ment the righteouſnes of a good conſcience.

                           . The originall word tranſlated breſt-plate, properly ſignifieth that part of the body, wherein the vitall parts, as the heart, lungs, liuer, and the like doe lie: the whole vpper part of a mans body before, euen from the necke to the thighes, is compriſed vnder this title. Hence is it, that that peece of armour which couereth this part of the body, hath the ſame name. The vſe of this peece is to keepe ſafe the vitall parts, and preſerue a man from being mortally wounded, or killed downe-right.
                     Thus doth righteouſneſſe keepe the Chriſtian ſouldier ſafe and ſure,Leo. in retia ſaepe lapſus capitur, ſanctiverò cum ligantur, fortiores ſiunt. Chryſ ad popul

which is ſtrong among beaſts, (Prou. 30. 30.) may be taken and deſtroied (1 Sam. 17. 3. 6.) but ſo cannot the righteous. This vſe of righteouſneſſe will yet more euidently appeare,Nothing but ſin can wound the ſoule. if wee conſider what it is that doth indeed mortally wound the ſoule, and draw

                        forth the vitall blood and very life of it. It is ſin, and nothing but ſin, that can deſtroy the ſoule. By it did Satan firſt wound and kil our firſt Parents. By it hath he from time to time preuailed in the World. For ſinne firſt prouoked Gods wrath; procured the curſe of the Law; brought death and all the concomitances thereof:1 Cor. 15 56

                     Where the breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe is well put on, there ſinne hath no power. Righteouſneſſe is as contrary to ſinne, as water to fire, and it will ſoone quench the heate of ſinne.

                           . word, is a change of the minde, namely, ſuch a change as bringeth forth a reformed life. This true alteration of the minde and heart, firſt cauſeth a thorow deteſtation of our former wicked courſe, together with an vtter abiuration, and renouncing of the ſame: and then an holy reſolute purpoſe to leade another kind of life, and inſteed of former ſinnes to practiſe contrary duties: as if a man in former times haue beene profane, to bee ſo much the more religious for the time to come: if a blaſphemer before, more carefull to honour the Name of God; if riotous, ſo much the more ſober, &amp;c. Theſe areMat. 3. 8. 
                        fruits worthy of repentance. So long as theſe two fruits of repentance, Firſt, an vtter deteſtation of all former wickedneſſe, Secondly, a conſtant reſolution, and faithfull endeauour, to performe new obedience, remaine in our hearts, the Diuell cannot eaſily, if at all preuaile againſt vs. But if the minde bee not altered, and a thorow change wrought therein, though there ſhould bee ſome meanes to reſtraine vs from ſinne, and prouoke vs to doe many good things, yet would the Diuell ſoone get aduantage againſt vs.
Heb. 3. 13. Sinne is deceitfull;1 Pet. 5 8. Satan is ſubtill and buſie; if therefore wee bee not altered in our hearts, the meanes of reſtraint being remoued, ſoone ſhall wee be brought to returne vnto our old wicked courſe, like the2 Pet. 2. 23. dogge to his vomit, and the ſow to the mire: for though the ſow be outwardly waſhed neuer ſo cleane, yet becauſe her ſwiniſh nature is not altered, ſo ſoone as ſhee commeth at mud, ſhee beſmeeres her ſelfe againe by wallowing in the mire.

The benefit of righteouſnes. are many and great.
                     1 It keepeth vs from being mortally wounded, as we heard before: for ſo long as we retaine a true purpoſe, and faithfull endeauour anſwearable thereto, wee ſhall neuer giue our ſelues ouer to commit ſinne.
                     
                        Obiect. They who haue had the moſt holy reſolution haue beene wounded, and that very deepely: witneſſe many of the beſt Saints, as Neah, Lot, Dauid, Peter, &amp; others.
                     
                        Anſwer. 1. At ſuch times as they fell ſo fouly, they forgot their reſolution; their breſt-plate was laid aſide. 2. Though the ſinnes of ſuch ſeemed groſſe and mortall in the kind or outward act, yet were they not ſo in their manner of performing them: they did them not with a full ſwinge &amp; ſway of will; their ſoule was not (to ſpeake properly) mortally wounded: for all their wounds (though they ſeemed very ſore and deepe) were cured; yea, many times their ſlips and fals were like vnto the breaking of a mans arme, or leg; which being well ſet againe, is the ſtronger.
                     
                         2 It bringeth great aſſurance of our effectual calling, and ſpirituall vnion with Chriſt, yea euen of our eternall election, and ſaluation. ForChap. 1. 4. 
                        God hauing choſen vs that we ſhould be holy, they that indeede are holy, may bee ſure they are choſen of God, and borne of God. To this purpoſe ſaithIoh. 2. 29. Saint Iohn, If ye know that he is Righteous, ye know that euery one which doth Righteouſneſſe, is borne of him. Being ſure of theſe, how can wee bee mortally wounded?
                     3 It procureth a2 Cor. 8. 18. good name in Gods Church while we liue, andProu. 10. 7. a bleſſed memory after we are dead,1 Pet. 3. 16. if any ſpeake euill of vs, they ſhall be aſhamed. Thus this Breſt-plate keepeth them from many skars and ſcratches.
                     4 It confirmeth the truth of Religion, and ſo it may be a meanes1 Pet. 3. 1. to win ſuch as are without,1 Theſ. 1. 6, 7 to ſtrengthen thoſe that ſtand, and2 Cor. 9. 2. to ſtirre vp all to an holy emulation.
                     5 It doth highly honour our Lord and captaine, whoſe ſouldiers we are.Mat. 5. 16. This motiue doth Chriſt vſe to ſtirre vs vp to put on the Breſt-plate of Righteouſneſſe.
                  
                  
                     §. 7. Whether mans Righteouſneſſe be meritorious.
                     MAny and ſundry are the wyles which the diuel hath againſt this Breſt-plate,V. Pomt. Satans wyles againſt righteouſneſſe. and thoſe either to make it of no vſe, or to make vs either not regard it, or to waxe weary of it.
                     He draweth on ſome to cracke and breake this Breſt-plate of Righteouſneſſe,1. Suggeſt. that righteouſneſſe is meritorious. by beating it out further then the mettall thereof will beare it, that is, (to ſpeake plainely) by making Righteouſneſſe to be meritorious. Heerewith he beguiled the Scribes and Phariſees, and ſuch as imbraced their doctrine, and egregiouſly hath he beſotted the Papiſts herewith.
                     
                         For auoiding this decent, we are duly to conſider what things are required to cauſe merit,
                           Anſwer. What things are required to merit. and how farre ſhort our righteouſneſſe commeth thereof.
                     Merit reſpecteth both the parties that giue and receiue the reward, and alſo the worke for which the reward is giuen.
                     He that vpon merit rewardeth, muſt receiue ſomthing for that he giueth, and in that reſpect is bound in Iuſtice, to giue the recompence which he giueth.
                     He that meriteth, muſt
                     1 Be free, and not bound by duty to doe that which he doth.
                     2 Be able of himſelfe, and by himſelfe, euen by his owne power to doe it.
                     3 Doe nothing afterwards whereby he forfeiteth that which once he hath merited.
                     The worke muſt both be perfect euery way, ſo as no iuſt fault can be found with it, and alſo worth the reward that is giuen for it.
                     Our righteouſneſſe can attaine to the height and pitch of none of theſe.Mans righteouſneſſe cannot be meritorious. For
                     1 It is God who giueth the reward. ButIob 22. 3. 
                        is it any thing to the Almighty that thou art righteous? or is it profitable to him that thou makeſt thy wayes vpright?

                        It is God who worketh in him both to will, and to doe. Beſides, if it were granted that a man had at any time of himſelfe, through his owne power done any thing, whereunto he were not bound, yet in other things hath he ſinned, (forRom. 3. 23. all haue ſinned) and thereby made forfeiture of his former merit.

If Adam in his innocency, had had any conceit of merit, hee had thereby ſtained his obedience: this conceit doth ſo de face the beſt worke, that it maketh it moſt odious: for it is directly contrary to the free grace and All ſufficient merit of Chriſt Ieſus.

                     IF Satan preuaile not that way,2 Suggeſt. that righteouſneſſe is needleſſe. hee will labour to perſwade men that this Breſt-plate of Righteouſneſſe is needleſſe, becauſe Chriſt hath wrought a full and perfect redemption, and left nothing for them to doe: by his Righteouſneſſe they ſhall be iuſtified and ſaued: ſo as they which haue the ſhield of Faith, need not this Breſt-plate. By this wyle did Satan beguile many Chriſtians in the Apoſtles time, taking aduantage by Saint Pauls ſound and orthodoxall doctrine of iuſtification by faith without workes: for the redreſſe whereof Saint I ames, and Saint Iude were moued to write their Epiſtles. Here▪ by alſo hath he beguiled many in theſe our daies, who haue beene deliuered from the darkeneſſe of Popery.
                     For auoiding this,
                           Anſwer. Righteouſnes is needfull to ſaluation. we are duely to weigh what is the end and vſe of Righteouſneſſe. Though it be not a meritorious cauſe of ſaluation, yet is it a meanes of attaining to ſaluation, the way appointed of God for vs to walke in thereunto; ſo that although we bee not ſaued for our Righteouſneſſe, yet we cannot be ſaued without it;1 Cor. 6. 9. 
                        The vnrighteous ſhal not inherite the Kingdome of God,
                        Heb. 12. 14. 
                        Without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God. ForEpheſ. 1. 4. 
                        God hath choſen vs that we ſhould be holy: andLuke 1. 75. 
                        Chriſt hath redeemed vs that we ſhould ſerue him in holineſſe and Righteouſneſſe. For this end appeared the grace of God, which bringeth ſaluation vnto all men,Tit. 2. 11, 12. 
                        that we ſhould liue righteouſly.
                        1 Theſ. 4. 7. 
                        Vnto holineſſe God hath called vs: andEpheſ. 2. 10. 
                        we are created vnto good workes. Thus we ſee how falſe a ſuggeſtion it is, that Righteouſneſſe ſhould be needleſſe; It is cleane contrary to the expreſſe charge of the Apoſtle,Tit 3. 14. that we ſhould learne to ſhew forth good workes for neceſſary vſes.
                     
                     Whereas it is pretended,Faith and righteouſnes haue their diſtinct vſes. that the ſhield of Faith is ſufficient, we are to hold it for a ruled caſe, that God maketh nothing in vaine,Mat. 19. 6. 
                        Thoſe things which God hath ioyned together, let no man put aſunder. Wherefore though we ſaw no diuerſe and diſtinct ends of Faith and Righteouſneſſe, yet God hauing appointed both, both muſt be vſed. But there are diuers vſes, apparent to all that will obſerue them. Righteouſneſſe is needfull to teſtifie our obedience and thankfulneſſe to God, to profit our brethren, to proue our faith, to giue euidence of our election, vocation, and iuſtification, and to maintaine our cauſe againſt the cauils of profaneſſe, impiety, wickedneſſe, &amp;c. Faith is needfull to apply Chriſts Righteouſnes, to ſupport vs againſt the imperfections, and defects of our Righteouſneſſe, and for many other good vſes, whereof wee ſhall heare on the 16. verſe.
                  
                  
                     §. 9. Of the iſſue of Righteouſneſſe.
                     A Third ſleight that the diuell hath,3. Suggeſt. that Righteouſnes is likeſome. is to perſwade men that this Breſt-plate of Righteouſneſſe is very comberſome and toileſome, and it wil make vs weary; for it is againſt our naturall diſpoſition, and wil be an hinderance of honour, wealth, eaſe, pleaſure, &amp;c.

Some caſt away this Breſt-plate for promotion ſake, not caring how they bribe, flatter, pleaſe and fawne vpon great men: others for wealth, oppreſſing, defrauding, and may wayes wronging their neighbours: others for their pleaſures, profaning the Sabbath, ſwearing, eating &amp; drinking, vnto gluttony and drunkenneſſe, vſing vnlawfull games, immoderately purſuing lawfull paſtimes, attyring themſelues in ſtrange apparrell aboue their eſtate, vnbeſeeming their place, &amp;c. Others to auoid outward reproch, for feare, directly againſt their heart and conſcience (I ſpeake it with great horror of heart) are profane and vnrighteous,

                     For auoiding this, we muſt haue more reſpect to the aſſured iſſue of Righteouſneſſe, then to ſome preſent ſeeming inconueniences thereof. We know that the Armour which ſouldiers weare on their bodies, is for the time comberſome and heauy: yet for ſafety they refuſe not to weare it: they conſider that it is much better to endure a ſmal burthen for a while, then to endanger their liues, and loſe the victory. Now ſuch is the bleſſed fruit and iſſue of Righteouſneſſe, that all the honour, profit, and pleaſure that can be loſt, or all the reproch or ſhame that can be endured for it, are not worthy of the Crowne of Righteouſneſſe, which the Lord the righteous Iudge will giue vnto his righteous ſeruants.

                     §. 10. Of the Comfort of Righteouſneſſe.
                     OVt of the anſwer to his firſt ſuggeſtion,4 Suggeſt. that righteouſneſſe is nothing worth. (if the diuell preuaile by none of the former) he will ſeeke to perſwade vs that this Breſt-plate of Righteouſneſſe can ſtand vs in no ſteed: becauſeIſa. 64. 6. 
                        All our Righteouſneſſe is as a menſtruous cloath: all is butPhil. 3. 8.

                        Anſw.
                        Righteouſnes acceptable vnto God. For auoiding this, we are to be informed that though our Righteouſneſſe, conſidered in it ſelfe, and compared with the perfect rule of the law, be exceeding defectiue; or oppoſed to the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, be dung and loſſe; yet as it is a worke of Gods holy Spirit in vs, proceeding from an heart purified by faith, all the imperfections therof being couered with the perfect Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, it is acceptable vnto God, and ſuch a thing as we may receiue much comfort in. Therefore though our Righteouſneſſe in it ſelfe, affoord no matter of boaſting, yet in regard of Gods gracious acceptation, it is a thing much to be laboured after; yea alſo to be reioyced in.

                           nes is ſufficient. he will endeuour to make vs careleſſe in ſome parts thereof, or at leaſt negligent in taking the preſent opportunity: as if it were ſufficient only in ſomethings to be righteous, becauſePſal. 103. 3. God is merciful to forgiue vs all our defaults: or vpon our death-beds to turne from our vnrighteouſneſſe, becauſeEzek. 18. 27. 
                        When the wicked turneth away from his wickedneſſe, hee ſhall ſaue his ſoule aliue. Herewith in all ages he hath beguiled many thouſands.
                     Againſt the firſt part of this ſuggeſtion,
                           Anſwer. The parts of righteouſnes may not be ſeuered. we are to know that the ſeuerall parts and branches of Righteouſneſſe, are ſo firmly and inſeparably knit together, that the parts cannot be ſeuered without the deſtruction of the whole. For Righteouſneſſe is as a chaine of many links,Qui vnam iuſtitiam fecerit cunctas virtutes impleſſe dicatur, quae inuicē ſe ſequuntur, &amp; ſibi haeren: 
                              •
                           ita vt qui vnam habuerit omnes habeat &amp; qui vna carucrit cunctis careat. Hier. in Iſa. 56. the ſeueral links of this chaine, are thoſe ſeuerall duties which the law requireth to be performed to God &amp; mā: let any one of the links be takē away, the chain is broke; if the chain be brokē, that which did hāg by it muſt needs fal down. To this purpoſe ſaith the Apoſtle.Iam. 2. 10. 
                        Whoſoeuer ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet faileth in one point is guilty of all. Righteouſneſſe is compared to aIob. 29. 14. garment, as well as to a Breſt-plate. A garment muſt couer vs all ouer: yea our Righteouſneſſe muſt be likeIoh. 19. 23, 24 Chriſts coate that may not be diuided: If it be cut in the middle, it cannot but make vs aſhamed, as2 Sam. 10. 4, 5. 
                        Dauids ſeruants were when their coats were cut.
                     
                        Obiect. If this were ſo, who ſhould be ſaued? forIam. 3, 2. 
                        in many things we ſinne all.
                     
                     
                        Anſw. Indeed all ſinne in many things: but all ſin not after the ſame manner. The righteous when they ſinne, are drawne into ſinne either through their owne weakeneſſe, or thorow the violence of ſome temptation: they take not liberty wittingly and willingly to nouriſh any ſinne, or omit any duty: in which reſpect they are ſaid
1 Ioh. 3 9. 
                        not to commit ſinne: and it is noted as a property of the righteous to2 Kin. 23. 25. Luk. 1. 6. 
                        walke in all the Commandements of God. When a righteous man is thus carefull and watchfull in auoiding ſinne, and doing his duty, then will the Lord be mercifull to pardon him his infirmities: but if any wilfully continue in any ſinne, what remaineth but a fearefull looking for of iudgement?
                  
                  
                     §. 12. Of the danger of deferring repentance.
                     AGainſt the ſecond part of the ſuggeſtion,Man cannot when hee liſt repent. wee are to know that although whenſoeuer an vnrighteous man truly repenteth, he ſhall be pardoned, yet he cannot truly repent whenſoeuer hee will. Hee that refuſeth to turne when God calleth him, prouoketh God to giue him ouer to the hardneſſe of his heart. As for ſuch as thinke to repent at their death, how know they what warning they ſhall haue of their death? May they not ſuddenly bee taken away asDan. 5. 30. 
                        Belſhazzar, andLuk. 12. 20. the rich foole? But what if ſome ſickneſſe come before as Deaths haruinger? Surely there is little hope that ſuch as before haue not, ſhould then turne vnto God: For then commonly is the body weake, the ſpirits faint, the heart dull, the mind troubled, and the Diuell moſt buſie about vs: and God hath giuen no promiſe to the vnrighteous to ſuccour him at that time, but ratherProu. 1. 27. &amp;c. the contrary.
                     
                        Obiection.
                        Luk. 23. 43. Chriſt was mercifull to a theefe at the time of his death.
                     
                        
                        Anſwer. 1. That one example of that kind is recorded, that none ſhould vtterly deſpaire: 2. Onely that one, that none ſhould preſume: 3. It cannot be proued that purpoſely he put off his repentance to that day▪ 4. It is not ſafe to make an extraordinary action (as this was) a patterne: for Chriſt did then miraculouſly worke on that theefe, to giue in that moment of his humiliation an euidence of his diuine power.
                  
                  
                     §. 13. Of being ouer-iuſt.
                     LAſtly,6. Suggeſt. That a man may be oueriuſt. hee beguileth many by ſuggeſting that they may beEccl. 7. 18. 
                        ouer-iuſt, and ſo maketh them the leſſe carefull in putting on the breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe.
                     
                        Anſwer.
                        Anſwer. For auoiding this, know for an vndoubted truth,Who are ouer-iuſt. that in true righteouſneſſe a man cannot be oueriuſt: that is, too ſtrict in auoiding any ſinne, or too conſcionable in performing any bounden duty. For why?
Rom. 6. 23. Euery ſinne is mortall. And of euery duty an account is to be giuen: for they are the Talents which God hath committed to our charge.
                     But for a man to make a righteouſneſſe vnto himſelfe which is not grounded on Gods word,Si quem ̄ ad omnia fratrum peccata cōſpexeris, hunc ſcito plus eſſe iuſtum, quam iuſtū eſt. Hi
                              •
                           r. and therein to be ſtrict, is to be ouer-iuſt. To count ſuch things to be ſinne, which by Gods Law are not made ſinne, is to bee ouer-iuſt: to be a buſie-body, is to be ouer-iuſt: to bee cenſorious without iuſt ground, is to be ouer-iuſt, &amp;c. But goe along by Gods word, which is the rule of righteouſneſſe, hold cloſe to it, and thou canſt not be ouer-iuſt.
                     Thus wee ſee how Gods word is able to make vs wiſe againſt all the wiles of the Diuell. Let our care be to make good vſe of that wiſdome.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 14. A direction for the vſe of Righteouſneſſe.
                     1. LEarne we what is true Righteouſneſſe, that we truſt not to a counterfeit breſt-plate, and bee pierced thorow while we thinke our ſelues ſafe.
                     2 Acquaint wee our ſelues with the vſe, end, beauty, benefit, and neceſſity of Righteouſneſſe, that we may be the more deſirous to get it if we haue it not: or if we haue it, the more carefull in keeping it faſt on, and cloſe to vs.
                     3 Let a daily examination bee made of our life paſt, that of all our former vnrighteouſneſſe wee may truly and ſoundly repent: and with the true euidences of our former righteouſneſſe, our conſciences may be comforted in the day of triall.Acts 23. 1. &amp; 24. 16.

                     §. 1. Of the Grace here meant.
                     
                        THe third peece of Spirituall Armour is not ſo plainely and diſtinctly laid downe as the former. It will be needfull 1. To ſearch out what is that particular grace which is her
                           •
                         meant. 2. How fitly it is compared to that part of harneſſe which is here implied. 3. How the grace here meant is gotten. 4. How needfull and profitable it is. 5. How it hath her perfect worke. 6. What are the extreames contrary to it. 7. What wiles the Diuell vſeth to depriue vs of it.
                     1. Becauſe the phraſe which the Apoſtle vſeth is ſomewhat doubtfull and ambiguous, there are many diſcrepant opinions about that which is meant thereby.
                     Among thoſe many, there are two which come neereſt to the point, and are implied vnder the deſcription of this grace, though neither of them (as I take it) be the grace it ſelfe. One is Knowledge of the Goſpell, the other is Peace of Conſcience. The former is implied vnder this word
Goſpell, (for without knowledge of the Goſpell the ſoule cannot be ſetled. The Goſpell vnto him which knowes it not, is no Goſpel, of no vſe at all.) The other is implied vnder this word
Peace, whereby is meant that Peace of Conſcience, which by the knowledge of the Goſpell is wrought in vs. But the Preparation here ſpoken of, is another grace diſtinct from both theſe; euen an effect which followeth from them both. Wherefore as the cauſes of a thing are not the thing it ſelfe, ſo neither of thoſe graces ſeuerally conſidered in it ſelfe, is the diſtinct peece of Armour here meant. The Syriach Tranſlator well cleareth the meaning of the Apoſtle, who thus turneth it;
Calceate in pedibus veſtris praeparationem Euangelij pacis. T
                              •
                           em. interp. 
                        Put as ſhooes on your feete the preparation of the Goſpell of Peace. Vnder this word Preparation then (according to the literall and Grammaticall conſtruction, which is the beſt and ſureſt) is the grace it ſelfe compriſed: for it implieth a furniture which the Goſpell of Peace procureth and prepareth: or an heart ſetled, reſolued, and prepared by the
Goſpell of Peace, to goe on to God thorow all difficulties. Now the very grace it ſelfe which thus ſetleth the ſoule, I take to bee Patience: for it is without all doubt, the drift
                     1. Some take the preparation of the Goſpell to bee a readineſſe to preach the Goſpell, thinking that the Apoſtle alludeth to that propheſie of Jſaiah; How beautifull are the feete of him that declareth peace. Iſa. 52. 7.
                     
                        Anſw. Thus this peece of armour ſhould appertaine onely to Miniſters,
                     whereas it is cleere that the Apoſtle preſcribeth the whole Armour to all Chriſtians.
                     2. Other, to bee a promptneſſe to profeſſe the Goſpell, agreeable to Saint Peters counſell, Be ready (or prepared) to giue an anſwere; &amp;c. 1. Pet. 3. 15.
                     
                        Anſwer. This promptneſſe and readineſſe, is rather an effect of the grace here meant, then the grace it ſelfe, as we ſhall after heare.
                     3. Other, to bee an Euangelicall obedience.
                     
                        Anſwer. Thus would it bee confounded with the former grace. For
Righteouſneſſe is an obedience to Gods word.
                     4. Other, to bee the Goſpell it ſelfe, alluding to that of Dauid, Thy word is a lampe vnto my feet. Pſal. 119. 105.
                     
                        Anſwer. The phraſe which the Apoſtle here vſeth, ſheweth that not ſo much the Goſpell it ſelfe, as ſomthing wrought thereby, is heere meant.

Hier. in hunc locum. to arme the Chriſtian ſouldier againſt trouble and affliction, by this particular peece of ſpirituall Armour here meant: but what grace ſo fit therevnto as patience? This was it wherewith Iob, to vſe Chriſts phraſe (Luke 21. 19.) did euen poſſeſſe his ſoule. And this is it which Saint Iames preſcribeth as a meanes to arme vs againſt trouble, Iam. 1. 3, 4, &amp;c. For patience is a gift of God, whereby wee are enabled to beare thoſe croſſes which God laieth vpon vs. Many were the troubles which the Chriſtian Hebrewes endured for profeſſion of the Goſpell: to enable them to endure all thoſe troubles, the Apoſtle ſaith;Heb. 10. 36. 
                        They had need of patience. Vnder this word Patience I compriſe all thoſe firſt graces of the Spirit, whereby the Goſpell teacheth that men are prepared to goe with Chriſt into the field; as the deniall of ones ſelfe, that taking vp of ones croſſe, with reſolution to follow Chriſt. It is here called

It is ſaid to bee the preparation of the Goſpell, becauſe it is the Goſpell which teacheth it, and is the cauſe thereof: nothing but the Goſpell can prepare a mans heart againſt trouble. Laſtly, this epithete Peace, is added to ſhew what the Goſpell bringeth vnto vs, and worketh in vs, namely, peace to God, as wee ſhall after more fully heare. To conclude this firſt point, in briefe note, that it is the knowledge of the glad tidings of reconciliation, which pacify

By feet he meanes legs alſo: the peeces of armour that are proper to this purpoſe, are called greaues, or leg-harneſſe, they are alſo called ſouldiers ſhooes, and bootes. The metaphor may either be generally taken of all ſhooes, or particularly of greaues. For the generall, wee all know that the vſe of ſhooes is to keepe our feete from ſharpe ſtones, hard clods, with the like: for our feete are naturally tender, inſomuch that if we goe abroad barefoot, euery hard ſtone hurteth them, euery ſharpe ſticke and pricking thorne pierceth them: therefore wee vſe not to venter abroade bare

                        foote: If any be ſo foole-hardy as to venter, ſoone will he waxe weary, and either ſit downe and goe no further, or elſe turne backe againe. But if wee haue good bootes or ſhooes on, then wee thinke our ſelues well fenced, and ſo with boldneſſe and courage goe on, whatſoeuer the way be.
                     To apply this.Application of the metaphor. Stones, ſtickes, thornes, and the like, are not more greeuous to our bare feete, then troubles, croſſes, and afflictions are to our naked heart and ſoule. Now then this world thorow which we muſt paſſe to Heauen, being a very hard and rough way, ſtony and thorny, full of all ſorts of afflictions; if our ſoules be naked and bare, not fenced with patience, and ſo fitted and prepared well to endure all croſſes, we ſhall either neuer venter to enter into this hard way, or at leaſt not endure to hold out therin. But if our ſoules be thorowly poſſeſt with ſound and true patience, then ſhall we with vndanted courage, paſſe thorow all the troubles of this World.
                     For the particular (which is the rather to be conſidered,The vſe of greaues in warre. becauſe the Apoſtles whole direction is taken from warre) the vſe of greaues and leg-harneſſe, were to keepe the legs and feet from hurts and wounds, becauſe if they were wounded or broken, a man could no longer ſtand, but was ouerthrowen. Such ſouldiers as ſtand in the front of the battell, or ſingle themſelues out alone as1 Sam. 17. 6 
                        Goliah, moſt commonly haue their legs fenced with theſe. Beſides, it being a ſtratagem which enemies oft vſe,Caeſ. Comment. to ſticke the way by which they know that the aduerſe parties muſt needes paſſe, with ſhort ſtubs and pikes, ends of ſpeares, and ſuch like, of purpoſe to gall their feete and legs, and make them weary of going on; ſouldiers vſe to weare bootes, and greaues, to preuent ſuch miſchiefes. Surely the Diuell vſeth ſuch a ſtratagem againſt Chriſtian ſouldiers: for knowing in what way they are to walke to Heauen, hee ſets many prickes and croſſes therein, as reproaches, diſgraces, troubles, vexations, perſecutions, by loſſe of goods, liberties, and liues; yea, many times grieuous torments and tortures: now if our ſoules be not fenced with the preparation of the Goſpell of Peace, what hope, yea, what poſſibility is there of going on, and holding out in that way?

that vnto you is borne a Sauiour which is Chriſt the Lord. Therefore the Hiſtories which purpoſely write of Chriſt Ieſus, declaring his Diety and humanity, his conception and birth, his life and death, words and deedes, humiliation and exaltation, &amp;c. are by an excellency and propriety termed Goſpels, or to ſpeake as the Scots doe, Euangiles, and the penne-men of them Euangeliſts. If it bee duely conſidered into what a woe-full eſtate man by ſin had implunged himſelfe, how no creature in Heauen or earth was able to ſuccour him, what full redemption Chriſt hath wrought and vnto how excellent an eſtate he hath redeemed vs,Euangelium eſt mare in qu

Hexam. lib. 5. cap. 7. it will appeare, that neuer the like glad tidings was or could be brought to man-kind then this, that Chriſt a Sauiour was giuen vnto them; ſo that this meſſage may well be called a Goſpel or Euangile. In it is the very fulneſſe of Gods fauour manifeſted.
                  
                  
                     §. 5. Of that Peace which the Goſpel cauſeth.
                     THe Peace heere ſpoken of,2 What peace is here meant is our reconciliation with God. In the beginning God made man after his owne Image, by vertue whereof, there was a ſweet harmony and concord betwixt God and man; God hauing reuealed vnto man what was his good will, pleaſing and acceptable vnto him; man being both able, and alſo willing to doe that which was acceptable to God. But long this Peace did not laſt: it was ſoone broken, and that wholly, and onely through mans default. For man wittingly ſinned againſt his Creator, and thereby iuſtly prouoked his wrath: thus came enmity betwixt God and man. Such a breach was made by mans rebellion, that all creatures in Heauen and earth were not able to make it vp. Chriſt therefore, the eternall, true, naturall, proper, onely begotten Sonne of God, tooke vpon him to be a Mediator betwixt God and man. Hee ſatisfied his Fathers Iuſtice, pacified his wrath, procured his fauour towards man, whereby God was moued to offer reconciliation vnto man;Deus appellatur pacis quia per Chriſtum ei reconciliati ſumus, qui eſt pax noſtra, Hieron. Hedib. quaeſt. 12. withall he gaue vnto man his ſanctifiing Spirit, to breed faith in him, that thereby man might receiue and embrace this reconciliation. In this reſpect God is called the God of Peace (Rom. 16. 20.) and Chriſt
our Peace, (chap. 2. 14.) Prince of Peace (Iſa. 9. 6.) And God is ſaid in Chriſt to reconcile the world vnto himſelfe,
                         (2 Cor. 5. 19.) Thus through the mediation of Chriſt, God offering, and man accepting reconciliation, a moſt perfect and inuiolable peace is made betwixt them, and this is the peace here meant. As fruits of this peace there flow from it remiſſion of ſinnes, quietneſſe and comfort of conſcience, ioy of heart, willingneſſe and ability to doe that which is pleaſing vnto God, freedome from the dominion of ſinne, from the power of the Diuell, from the euill of all croſſes, from the ſting of death, and of the graue, and from the feare and fire of Hell.
                  
                  
                     §. 6. Why it is called the Goſpel of Peace.
                     THis Peace is ſo appropriated to the Goſpel,3 How Peace is appropriated to the Goſpel. that it is called the Goſpel of Peace, and that in a double reſpect, Firſt, of the matter. Secondly, of the effect.
                     1 The ſubiect matter of this glad tidings, is the forenamed Peace and reconciliation betwixt God and man. The Goſpel firſt declared, and ſtill continueth to publiſh the ſame: neither the Law, nor any humane writings can doe this: therefore ſo ſoone asLuk. 2. 10, 11 one Angel had declared this glad tidings, an whole troope of heauenly ſouldiers cryed out14. 
                        Peace on earth. It was the Goſpel which declared peace toGen. 3. 15. 
                        Adam,
                        &amp; 7. 1. 
                        Noah,
                        &amp; 12. 3. 
                        Abram, and the reſt of the Saints in al ages, before and ſince Chriſts time.Iſa. 52. 7. They therefore which preach the Goſpel, are ſaid to publiſh Peace.
                     
                     2 It is a powerfull effect of this Goſpel, to worke Peace in them that heare it, and beleeue it. ForGal. 3. 2. in and by the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, the Spirit of Chriſt is conueyed into our hearts: in which reſpect it is called
2 Cor. 3. 8. 
                        the miniſtration of the Spirit. This Spirit firſt moueth vs to embrace reconciliation offered in the Goſpel, and then it quieteth our conſcience, and ſo worketh Peace therein.
                     How admirably doth this commend vnto vs the loue of God,
                           Vſe 1. Gods loue. and of his Sonne our Sauiour? he thought it not enough, that at firſt he made al in peace, though he might iuſtly haue reiected man for euer, as he did the Diuels, becauſe man willingly and rebelliouſly broake this Peace; yet to magnifie his mercy towards man, he ſpared not his Sonne, but gaue him to be our Peace, who, (to vſe the Scripture phraſe)Cha. 2. v. 16. 
                        ſlue hatred, and made Peace: yea not ſo onely, but alſo gaue his Goſpel, thereby making open proclamation of Peace, and inuiting men to imbrace it. Excellently is this ſet forth in theMat. 22. 2. &amp;c. parable of the Kings ſonnes wedding;Luk. 14. 16. &amp;c. if we doe as they who were inuited thereunto, how iuſtly doe we deſerue to be depriued of this Peace?
                     What a bleſſing is it to haue the Goſpel preached among vs:
                           Vſe 2. A bleſſing to haue the Goſpel. the Goſpel of Peace, ſuch aPhil. 4. 7. Peace as paſſeth vnderſtanding? Is it not an heauy curſe to want this Goſpel? this ſhould be a ſtrong motiue to ſtirre vp Miniſters, diligently and faithfully to preach the Goſpel, and to ſtirre vp people earneſtly to giue heed and credence thereunto, euen as they tender their Peace.
                  
                  
                     §. 7. Of the ground of true Patience.
                     FRom that which hath beene deliuered of the Goſpel of Peace,4 The Goſpel of peace prepareth a mans heart againſt trouble. that maine point which we haue in hand, by neceſſary conſequence followeth, that the onely meanes of preparing our ſoules patiently to beare all croſſes, and conſtantly to goe through all troubles in our Chriſtian courſe, is a right knowledge of the glad tidings of our reconciliation with God.
                        Gen. 12. 2, 3, It was this Goſpel of Peace wherewith God encouraged
                        Abraham to come out of his owne countrey, and with a patient and prepared heart to paſſe ouer all theſe difficulties whereunto he ſhould be brought. This was that glad tidings which the Lord brought toExod. 3. 6, 7

                        Gedeon, and many others for that very end. I might inſtance this in many thouſand examples, and ſhew how the courage and patience of the Saints, which hath beene admirable to the world, hath beene grounded on this ſure foundation the Goſpel of Peace. For the truth is, that all the Prophets all the Apoſtles, all the true Chriſtian confeſſors, and Martyrs in all ages, who haue endured more then fleſh and blood could poſſibly with patience beare, haue had their feete ſhod, that is, their hearts armed and prepared with aſſurance of their reconciliation with God: but hauing ſuch a cloude of witneſſes, I will content my ſelfe with naming two or three.
                     Many and ſundry were the troubles, inward and outward, by open enemies, and deceitfull friends, on Sea and land, which Saint Paul went thorow, and that with an inuincible courage and reſolution: the cauſe of all is euident to be thatRom. 8 31, 32, &amp;c. knowledge which he had of Gods loue to him, and of his reconciliation with God. On this ground of confidence he did after an holy manner inſult ouer all aduerſe power.Iam. 5. 11. But Iob yet ſuffered much more, and his patience was ſo admirable, that the holy Ghoſt maketh choice of him aboue all other, as a marke to behold, and a patterne to follow. What was the ground of his patience? ſurely many of thoſe diuine ſpeeches which he vttered to his wife and friends, euidently ſhew, that the knowledge of his reconciliation with God, was it which made him ſo confident and patient. There is yet another who farre exceeded theſe and all other Saints both in ſuffering and patient bearing, namely Chriſt: the aſſurance of his Fathers loue was the ground of his patience, as appeareth both by thatIoh 17. 24. profeſſion which he made thereof, a little before his ſuffering (ſaying vnto his Father, Thou louedſt me before the foundation of the world,) and alſo by thoſe titles which in his moſt bitter agony he gaue vnto God, as in the Garden▪

                     §. 8. Of the meanes whereby Patience is wrought.
                     THus we ſee the truth of this point ſufficiently proued;The Goſpel prepareth our hearts by declaring. that the Goſpel of Peace, is the ground of Patience: now further conſider how it doth prepare the ſoule of man to endure. This it doth by perſwading mans mind, and reſoluing his heart of theſe two principles.
                     1 That nothing ſhall hurt him.
                     2 That all things ſhall turne to his good.
                     For the firſt,1 That nothing can hurt vs. moſt ſure it is that nothing can make vs miſerable, but onely ſinne: Sinne is the very ſting of all troubles aed croſſes: ſinne is it which maketh them to be heauy burdens: this maketh trouble of conſcience to be intollerable: death and the graue to be moſt terrible: the diuell which hath the power of death to bee ſo horrible: yea, the Law of God, and God himſelfe to bee ſo full of dread and terrour. Let ſinne be remoued, and our conſcience aſſured thereof; then may we, then will we comfort our ſelues in all troubles: for then ſhall we appeare before the Throne of God, as before the mercy-ſeat of a gracious Father, and take his Law, as a direction to teach vs how to pleaſe him. Then ſhall wee eſteeme all croſſes as corrections of the Lord for our profit, yea, as his phyſicke to purge out our corruptions, &amp; as proofes of his graces in vs. Then will our conſcience reſt quiet and well contented: then ſhall we thinke of death, as of a gate to heauen, and of the graue, as of a ſweet bed to reſt in, till the day of the conſummation of our eternall bliſſe in body and ſoule: yea, then ſhall wee not need to feare the diuell, becauſe he can haue no power ouer vs, much leſſe hell and the torment thereof. Therefore doth

                        Dauid annexe bleſſedneſſe to remiſſion of ſin: ſo that
Mat. 9. 2. vpon this ground might Chriſt well ſay to the man ſicke of the palſie, Sonne, be of good comfort.
                     
                     This being ſo, the Goſpel of Peace which aſſureth vs of our reconciliation with God, and of the remiſſion of our ſinne, aſſureth vs alſo that nothing can hurt vs, becauſe the ſting of euery thing, which is ſinne, is pulled out. If the forked tongue of an adder, the poyſonous teeth of a ſnake, the ſharpe ſting of a waſpe be pulled out, what hurt can they doe?

                        We know that all things worke together for good, vnto them that loue God.

                         1 It is no part of manhood, but meere childiſhneſſe and cowardlineſſe to be impatient.
                     2 Sorrow, mourning, all impatiency, and the like, may much aggrauate our troubles, but can no way eaſe them or take them away.
                     3 Others are ſubiect to troubles: it is a common condition of mankinde.
                     4 There is an ineuitable neceſſity, or (to vſe the words and phraſe) a fatall deſtiny, they cannot be auoided.
                     5 They are not for euer to endure, but will haue an end, if by no other meanes, yet by death. Theſe and ſuch like may make men bold and hardy, or ſtupid and blockiſh. I may reſemble them to Opium, and ſuch like medicines which ſtupifie mens ſenſes, and make them the leſſe impatiently beare their paines, but they bring no true eaſe.

                           Point 4 THe fourth generall point to be conſidered,
The neceſſity of patience. is the neceſsity of this peece of Spirituall Armour. Though it be compared to legge-harneſſe, which may ſeeme to be leaſt neceſſary,Simil. yet indeed it is no whit leſſe neceſſary then any of the reſt: we know that if a man be not well fenced on his legges, he may receiue ſuch a blow vpon them, as will cleane ouerthrow him, notwithſtanding the other peeces of armour? but if the way be rough and thorny, and the man bare-footed and bare-legged, and in that reſpect dareth not marche on, what benefit reapes he by the furniture of the other parts? To let the metaphor paſſe; the gift and grace it ſelfe which now wee ſpeake of,
Patience, is ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as without it there can be no hope of attaining to victory, glory, and reſt, where Chriſt our chiefe Captaine is.Heb. 10. 36. The Apoſtle expreſly ſaith, that patience is needfull: to ſhew that he ſpeaketh of an abſolute neceſſity, hee implieth that the promiſe (meaning eternall life promiſed) cannot bee receiued without it: for he had ſhewedV. 6. 12. before, that the Saints in former times thorow faith and patience inherited the promiſe, and in that reſpect both that Apoſtle, and alſo

Many are the troubles of the righteous, euen in the moſt halcion and peaceable dayes that euer were.

                     §. 17. Of the kinds of croſſes.
                     THat wee may the better apply this Apoſtolicall direction, as before in generall wee ſhewed the neceſſity of patience, ſo here in particular we will ſhew how neceſſary it is that patience haue this perfect worke.
                     This will appeare by the kinds of croſſes whereunto we are ſubiect.
                     1 They are not ſcar-crowes, troubles in ſhew and appearance onely, but ſuch as pierce both body and ſoule, and make the ſtoureſt to ſtoupe and ſhrinke. Therefore counterfeite patience will ſtand vs in no ſteed.
                     2 The number of trials whereunto wee ſhall bee brought, is vncertaine: one calamity vpon another (as waues) may fall vpon vs:Iob. 1. 16, 17. 18. that which is written of Iob, how one meſſenger followed another, all bringing dolefull newes, ſheweth what may befall any of vs. Now ſuppoſe wee ſhould as patiently beare ſome, as Iob, but yet taint vnder the burden of others; where is the benefit of that former patience? Some that haue endured impriſonment, baniſhment, and ſuch like trials, yea who haue beene ready to endure ſword and fire in time of perſecution, haue beene diſcouraged and turned out of their good courſe by reproch, and diſgrace, in time of peace: other that can patiently paſſe ouer publicke troubles, are ſo diſquieted with priuate loſſes, and croſſes at home in their families, that they are made vnfit to performe any Chriſtian duty to God, or man. Other that can well endure paine of body, ſickeneſſe and ſuch like croſſes, cannot beare vexation of mind, or diſturbance of their paſſion.
                     3 It is alſo vncertaine how long we ſhall be ſubiect to tryals, becauſe the continuance of our life is vncertaine. This world is the field of the Lords battell, ſo long as we are in the field, the enemies will aſſault vs: now to yeeld before the battell be ended, is worſe then neuer to haue endured any at all: the glory of all our former patience is not onely loſt, but alſo turned into ſhame and ignominy, andHeb. 10. 38.

                        Dauid ſeemeth, by his owne confeſſion, to haue fainted in his mourning: for ſuch is the feebleneſſe of our nature, ſuch our forgetfulneſſe of Gods power and promiſes, that we oft let go from vs thoſe ſtayes and props, which the Lord hath afforded vnto vs, to vphold. The Apoſtle implyeth, that euen Gods children, without great watchfulneſſe, and continuall obſeruation, are very ready to waxe faint. Experience, as of all other times, ſo of ours alſo, doth verifie as much. For how is it that there ſhould be ſuch ſlackeneſſe in many, who haue beene heeretofore very forward &amp; zealous, and that mens after proceedings ſhould bee ſo vnlike to their former good beginnings, but that they faint by reaſon of that hard way, and thoſe manifold troubles, by which wee muſt paſſe vnto heauen? Great is the danger and damage of this fainting: it makes men weary of well doing, it cauſeth them to repent of the good which is done, and to turne backe into an eaſier courſe (as they ſuppoſe) and ſo to loſe all the glory of that good which hath beene done: yea, it oft cauſeth fearefull doubting, and deſpaire, and ſo maketh all the help which the Scripture affordeth to be in vaine.

                           piſing Gods corrections. that we fall not into the former, obſerue theſe few directions.
                     1 In all afflictions looke (as2 Sam. 16. 11. 
                        Dauid did) vnto him who ſmiteth, and know that they come not by chance, but by Gods wiſe diſpoſing prouidence: and that purpoſely to breed in vs true remorſe.
                     Know alſo that the Lord can adde croſſe vnto croſſe, till he pull downe our ſtout ſtomacks, or breake our proud backes, and bring vs to vtter confuſion. Yea, know that his wrath is as his greatneſſe, infinite, vnſupportable: on whomſoeuer it lighteth, it cruſheth him down to hell: ſo that though a man might thinke he could beare all outward croſſes, yet Gods wrath can preſſe him much more heauily.
                     2 Take notice of the iudgements which other men by deſpiſing the Lord, bring vpon themſelues: this may worke vpon thine hard heart. It is an eſpeciall point of wiſedome to be warned by other mens harmes. This was the wiſedome of the third captaine which was ſent to Eliah.

                     3 Make vſe of the leaſt croſſes, and begin ſpeedily to humble thy ſelfe. If thy heart begin to be touched, ſuffer it not preſently to be hardned againe, but more and more humble thy ſelfe. Thus will the Lord repent of the iudgment he intended, and turne from his wrath, as he did in the time of Hezekiah.

                     2 Call to mind his manifold promiſes: both thoſe which reſpect his gracious aſſiſtance of vs in the tryall, and his mighty deliuerance of vs out of it.
                     3 Remember examples of former times, how he neuer oppreſſed thē that patiently endured his corrections.
                     Theſe two extreames are directly contrary to the two branches of this verſe, namely to the preparation heere ſpoken of, and to the ground thereof, the Goſpel of Peace. If we be prepared, we ſhall not deſpiſe Gods corrections: if prepared by the Goſpel of Peace, we ſhall neuer faint: that will vphold vs, or nothing.

                     THe laſt point remaining to be handled,VII. Point. Satans wyles to vnfurniſh our ſoules. is, to diſcouer the cunning deuices of the diuell, whereby the laboreth to keepe vs vnfurniſhed and vnprepared againſt troubles: they are many; I will diſcouer onely foure of the principall, by which all the reſt may be diſcerned.
                     Two of theſe foure are againſt the furniture it ſelfe: the other two againſt the ground thereof, The Goſpel of Peace.
                     
                     Againſt the furniture he ſuggeſteth,
                     1 That there is no need of it.
                     2 That if there ſhould be need of it, yet it would ſtand a man in no ſteed.
                     The firſt he ſuggeſteth before troubles come, to make them feare none, but be careleſſe.
                     The ſecond when they are come, to make them deſpaire and ſinke vnder the burden. Firſt therefore to this effect he obiecteth.
                     
                        Suggeſtion 1. If ye be Gods children, what needeth ſuch adoe about preparation?What need of patience. Doe you thinke that God will not more tender and reſpect his then to ſuffer them to fall into trobles? you may well enough be ſecure and feare nothing. Thus the diuell tempteth many in their peace and proſperity: it appeareth thatPſal. 30. 6. 
                        Dauid was in this manner aſſaulted.
                     
                        Anſw.
                        Very great need. Experience of all men in all ages doth ſufficiently confute the ſubſtance of this ſuggeſtion, and plainly diſcouer the falſehood of it (as§. 12. I ſhewed before.)
Dauid, who was a while beguiled with this vaine conceit, quickly found out by wofull experience the deceit of it, and thereupon ſaith vnto God,Pſal. 30. 7. 
                        Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled. It is very likely that then the Diuell beguiled him when his2 Sam. 7. 1. kingdome was fully eſtabliſhed, &amp; he had reſt from all his enemies: obſerue the hiſtory of his troubles, which came vpon him after that, and ye ſhal find it to be a very vaine and falſe conceit.
                     As for the ground whereupon the ſuggeſtion is built,God in loue and wiſdome correcteth. namely the good reſpect which God beareth to his children, know, that God is euen thereby moued to lay many croſſes vpon them: for as he is a louing Father, ſo he is a wiſe God: in wiſdome he ſeeth that it is needfull his children ſhould be corrected: his veryHeb. 12. 6. loue therefore moueth him to correct them.
                     That we may oppoſe godly wiſedome againſt the wicked policy of our enemy,In peace be prepared againſt trouble. let vs haue this furniture in a readines, euen in the time of our greateſt peace and proſperity, and ſo prepare our ſelues againſt trouble. To prepare for troubles in time of proſperity before they come, is an eſpeciall meanes to make vs well beare them in time of aduerſity when they come. We know that death is moſt fearefull and terrible to them that leaſt looke for it: ſo are all afflictions whatſoeuer.

Yea, it maketh great and heauy burdens ſeeme much lighter then otherwiſe they would.Horat Leuius fit patientia quicquid corrigere eſt nefas. The heathen who were guided onely by the light of nature, obſerued thus much. I haue my ſelfe obſerued two ſeuerall perſons lying vnder the ſame croſſe.

                     Further I adde,3 It preuenteth and remoueth many. that this preparation doth preuent and remoue many ſore troubles; as anguiſh of ſoule, vexation of ſpirit, diſquietneſſe of mind, diſtemper in affections, with the like: which though they oft riſe from outward croſſes, yet they oft proue more heauy burdens then thoſe ſame from whence they did ariſe. For example, a couetous man hauing a ſmall loſſe which he might well beare, if he were ſhod with this furniture, by his diſquietneſſe of mind, and impaciency for that loſſe bringeth a much heauier croſſe vpon him. So in ſicken

So the feare of troubles is oft worſe the trouble it ſelfe: and fretting againſt the malice of an enemy doth a man more hurt then the enemy himſelfe can. Now this furniture of the ſoule may both preuent, and alſo remoue theſe great and greeuous croſſes, as anguiſh of mind and ſpirit, needleſſe feares, fretfulneſſe, enuy, murmuring, with the like.
                  
                  
                     §. 25. Anſwer to Satans ſuggeſtion againſt Gods loue in corecting.
                     AGainſt the ground of this preparation, which is the Goſpell of Peace, Satan obiecteth one while that there is no reaſon to relie on it: another while, that it procureth more troubles to them that reſt on it.
                     
                        Suggeſt.
                        Can there be peace with God while God ſcourgeth. 3. Troubles are fruits of Gods wrath: to conceit any peace with God while troubles lie on vs, is to call darkeneſſe light, and hatred loue. To build patience on aſſurance of reconciliation with God, is to caſt anchor vppon quicke-ſands, or in a bottomeleſſe Sea. A man may better hope for life when the tokens of the plague appeare vpon his skinne, then hope for reconciliation with God, while troubles, the tokens of Gods wrath, lie vpon him. The aſſaults of Iobs wife and friends tended much to this purpoſe.
                     
                        Anſwer.
                        God in loue correcteth. The ground of this ſuggeſtion being applied to the Saints, is directly falſe, and contrary to the current of the Scripture, which oft teſtifieth thatProu. 3. 12. Heb. 12. 6. 
                        whom the Lord loueth he chaſteneth. The ends which God aimeth at in correcting his children, and the fruits which anſwerably iſſue from thence (whereof we haue heard§. 13. before) euidently demonſtrate, that the troubles of the righteous are no fruits of Gods wrath, but rather of his loue. Yet a wonder it is to ſee how many are deceiued with this diabolicall ſuggeſtion; and they not onely profane and wicked men, but euen deare Saints of God, while the croſſe lieth vpon them, asPſal 79. 5 
                        Dauid. The reaſon is, becauſe at that time Sence worketh more then Faith. Wherefore for the auoiding of this aſſault, we muſt let faith haue the predominancy and higheſt rule in vs, euen aboue reaſon and ſence: we muſt2. Cor. 5. 7 
                        walke by faith, and not by ſight. Faith reſteth on Gods word, and beleeueth what it ſaith, though ſence contradict it neuer ſo much. Now the word of God affirming that God correcteth whom hee loueth; if faith beare ſway in vs, it will perſwade vs that in our greateſt troubles God loueth vs, and in loue bringeth thoſe troubles vpon vs. Wherefore for the ſtrengthening of our faith, let vs oft meditate ofHeb. 12. 5 
                        the conſolations of the Scripture.

                        Suggest.
                        Is not the want of the Goſpell the beſt way to bee free from trouble? THe Diuell to ſhew that he careth not which way he preuaileth, ſo he preuaile any way, hath a contrary fetch. Hee will grant indeed that God ſcourgeth euery ſonne whom he loueth; but with all addeth, that the more God loueth any, 
                           •
                        he more troubles he bringeth vpon them; and therefore inferreth, that the Goſpell of peace is ſo farre from being a meanes to defend vs from trouble, that it is the cauſe of much trouble; and therefore the beſt way to be free from trouble, is to bee without the Goſpell of peace. Thus wasPſa 73. 13. 14

                        No verily. It is falſe that the more God loueth any, the more he ſcourgeth them: For as Gods wiſdome moueth him to correct his children, ſo his loue moueth him to moderate his correction. Beſides, the inference, that therfore reconciliation with God is no good remedy againſt troubles, is vnſound and abſurd: for, aſſurance of our reconciliation with God, ſweetneth all troubles. But for a more full anſwere to this ſuggeſtion, note theſe foure points concerning the benefit of our peace with God in the caſe of afflictions.
                     1▪ That it keepeth many iudgements from vs which fall vpon the wicked: yea, which otherwiſe would fall on vs.
                     2▪ That it alters the nature of all troubles which befall vs.
                     3. That by it wee are aſſiſted and ſupported in all.
                     4. That by reaſon thereof we ſhall be deliuered and freed from all.
                     Theſe 4 cōfortable points I wil diſtinctly proue, becauſe by them al the euil ſuggeſtiōs of Satan may be anſwered.

There Gods curſes are denounced againſt the wicked, but his bleſſings promiſed to the righteous: reade the 91 Pſal. where Dauid expreſly confirmeth this point, and ſheweth how they which truſt vnder the ſhadow of the Almighty, and ſo haue peace with him, are deliuered from many troubles. Note the Hiſtories of the Iewes vnderidolatrous and wicked Kings, and vnder religious and good Kings; God being forſaken by them, brought many calamities vpon them: but being loued of theſe, deliuered them from many which their enemies intended againſt them: Yea, when generall iudgements were brought vppon the Land,Ezec. 9. 4 God ſent forth one to marke thoſe whom hee loued, that they might bee ſpared in the iudgement. The reaſon is cleare: for it is ſinne which cauſeth the moſt grieuous iudgements: Now the Goſpell of peace being a meanes to mooue God to for giue vs the ſinnes which wee haue committed, and to moue vs to forſake our ſinnes, and to ſeeke to pleaſe him, it muſt needs be a meanes to keepe vs from many iudgements, which otherwiſe would fall vpon vs. Beſides, it keepeth vs from a reprobate ſence, (whereunto theRom. 1. 28. heathen were giuen, and theActs 28. 29. Iewes after they had loſt their peace with God:) from deſpaire, whereuntoMat. 27. 5. 
                        Iudas fell; and from hell fire, whichMat. 25. 46. ſhall torment wicked men. Theſe of all are the moſt wofull iudgements, and from theſe doth the Goſpell of peace wholy free men.
                     Here note what an egregious point of folly it is to feare to pleaſe God, for feare of troubles; as if a man ſhould feare to put on ſhooes, left his ſhooes ſhould cauſe ſtones to lie in his way: yet many feare to be at peace with God, becauſe it maketh men to hate, reuile, reproach, ſcorne, wrong, and perſecute them: not conſidering that Gods wrath is infinitely greater then mans. Are they not like the fiſh that leapeth out of the warme water, into the flaming fire? Or rather like ſelfe-murtherers, who to free themſelues from ſome momentany anguiſh in this world, caſt themſelues into hell torments, which is endleſſe, and eaſeleſſe?

                        Anſwer. True it is that God taketh occaſion from ſinne, to puniſh his children, but not in vengeance for the ſinne committed which is paſt, but for a warning to make them the more carefull and watchfull ouer themſelues for the time to come. And herein lieth a maine difference betwixt the puniſhment of a Iudge and a Father: a Iudge reſpecteth the fact paſt; if it be againſt the Law, though the delinquent partie be neuer ſo penitent, and though there bee neuer ſo great hope of his amendment, yet hee denounceth the ſentence of Law againſt the Malefactor: but if a father be verily perſwaded that his child will neuer commit the like treſpaſſe againe, which he hath committed, aſſuredly hee would remit the puniſhment: but when hee correcteth, it is to preuent the like in the time to come.
                     God carrieth himſelfe as a Iudge to the wicked, but as a Father to the Saints: his corrections are for their inſtruction, not for their deſtruction. AsHeb. 12. 10. God aimeth at his childrens good and profit in correcting them, ſo alſo hee giueth them a ſweete taſte of the good they receiue thereby, which maketh themPſal. 119. 71. 75. acknowledge as much, and he thankefull for it; and ſo carry themſelues towards God, as a good patient towards his Phyſitian, who hath preſcribed bitter pils vnto him: for the time he digeſts them willingly, and after he hath felt a kindly worke of them, he thanketh them.

                     §. 1. Of the Apoſtles manner of preſsing the point of Faith.
                     
                        THe fourth peece of Spirituall Armour is more largely ſet forth, and more forcibly vrged then any of the reſt. For the Apoſtle contenteth not himſelfe with a bare exhortation, to ſtir vs vp to vſe it, but with weighty reaſons preſſeth his exhortation, and that on both ſides, before and behind: Before, comparatiuely, preferring it to all other graces (aboue all.) Behind, ſimply, declaring the vertue and efficacy of it, (whereby yee ſhall bee able to quench, &amp;c.) By the firſt he maketh way to his exhortation; by the laſt he knocketh it downe faſt, euen to the head, as we ſpeake.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 2. Of vrging matters of moment:
                     HEre by the way wee may learne a good inſtruction both for Miniſters and people.
                     For Miniſters,Matters of weight to bee preſſed of Miniſters. that they obſerue what points bee of greateſt weight and by ſome ſpeciall item and memento, to raiſe vp their peoples attention thereunto, yea, and with ſome ſpeciall euidence of reaſon and argument to inforce the ſame. Thus becauſe the obſeruation of the fourth Commandement, is an eſpeciall meanes to bring men to keepe all the other Commandements, the Lord prefixed a memento (Remember the Sabbath day) and withall vſeth many ſtrong reaſons, the more to ſtirre vs vp to keepe it.
                     Thus is an expectation wrought in the hearers,Reaſons. of ſome point of moment; which will be an eſpeciall meanes to moue them the better to obſerue it, and to ponder it.
                  
                  
                     §. 3. Of giuing heed to weighty matters.
                     For people, that when they obſerue any one point aboue other to be vrged &amp; preſſed, they giue the more diligent heed thereto:Heb. 2. 1. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . for if euery duty laide downe in Gods word be ſtedfaſt, that is, firme, ſure, and inuiolable; ſo as the tranſgreſſors thereof ſhall reape a iuſt recompence of reward, how ſhal they eſcape who neglect thoſe maine and principall duties, which aboue others are moſt earneſtly vrged? Let that therefore which is moſt preſſed by the Spirit and Miniſters of God, be beſt regarded by the people of God.
                     
                        Obiect. This eſpeciall heed of one point will make men careleſſe of other.
                     
                        
                        Anſw. Nothing leſſe: for the end thereof is not to make vs ſlothfull in any point, but to quicken vs vp, and make vs extraordinarily carefull in that which is ſo vrged. Suppoſe a maſter ſend his ſeruant of a meſſage, and giue him many things in charge to do,Simil. but giueth him an eſpeciall item for one, and vſeth many reaſons to make him carefull of it, doth he giue his ſeruant any occaſion to neglect the other? or wil a good ſeruant take any occaſion from thence, to neglect them? Such collections are made onely by mans ſloathfull fleſh; they which gather them, abuſe the wiſdom &amp; care of God to help our weaknes; they who are guided by Gods Spirit, will be otherwiſe minded, knowing that an extraordinary vrging of one point, is to make vs extraordinarily carefull of that, but careleſſe and negligent of none.

tranſition, whereby the Apoſtle paſſeth from other points to this. Secondly, his exhortation vnto the grace heere mentioned.

                           1 The matter thereof.
                           2 The motiue thereto:
                        
                     
                     
                        That layeth downe a duty to be performed (Take the ſhield of Faith.)
                     
                     
                        This declareth the benefit of performing that duty in the laſt words, that ye may be able to quench, &amp;c.
                     
                     In the duty obſerue, the action required, (take,) and the obiect thereof: which is both plainly expreſſed (Faith) and alſo illuſtrated by a metaphor (ſhield.)
                     
                     The motiue declareth the power, vertue and efficacy of Faith; which is, to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
                         Touching this grace thus ſet downe, I will deliuer theſe points.
                     Firſt in generall by way of preface and preparation, I will firſt ſhew how excellent a grace it is: and then more particularly and diſtinctly declare,
                     2 What Faith is.
                     3 How fitly it is reſembled to a ſhield.
                     4 How it is wrought.
                     5 How it muſt be proued.
                     6 How it may be preſerued.
                     7 How it is to be vſed.
                     8 What it is the benefit, and power of it.
                     9 What are the wiles of the diuell to keepe vs from it, and how they may be auoided.

                        aboue all. All theſe in effect imply one and the ſame thing, onely this latter is ſomewhat more emphaticall, and as proper as any of the reſt. This is ſomewhat like toPro. 4. 23.

                         that Hebrew phraſe, which Solomon vſeth,
Keep thine heart aboue all keepings, implying thereby, that the heart of all other parts is moſt narrowly to be watched ouer, moſt carefully and diligently to be looked vnto, ſo is Faith aboue all to be regarded.
                     
                        Queſt. Is Faith ſimply more excellent and neceſſary, then other ſauing graces?
                     
                        
                        Anſwer. All ſauing graces are in their kind very excellent and neceſſary, as hath before bene ſhewed of verity, righteouſneſſe and patience: neither can a Chriſtian wel ſpare, and be without any of them: for they are as ſeuerall linkes of one chaine, whereby a Chriſtian is held out of hell; if but one linke breake, the chaine is broken, and downe falleth he that was held thereby: yet ſome linkes in a chaine may be put to greateſt ſtreſſe, and ſo be of greateſt vſe. Faith ſerues to beare the greateſt brunts, and in that reſpect may be counted moſt excellent, and moſt neceſſary; euen as the ſhield of all other parts of armour is the moſt needfull, as we ſhall after heare.

item on one of them, and ſay, Aboue all remember this, would not this item make him the more to regard it? As
Gal. 6. 10. where the Apoſtle ſaith, Doe good to all, eſpecially to them who are of the houſhold of Faith: doth it not make a Chriſtian ſo much the more to be moued with compaſſion, when hee ſeeth any of the faithfull ſtand in need of his helpe? Hence then I obſerue that,

                        egation of himſelfe, and in the mediation of Chriſt Ieſus: for well he knoweth, that himſelfe is all ouer defiled with ſinne, and that Ieſus Chriſt the Iuſt, is an aduocate with the Father, who by his blood purgeth vs from our ſinnes, and with his righteouſneſſe couereth vs. This manner of appearing before God, ſheweth, that the beleeuer acknowledgeth God to be ſo perfectly holy, as he cannot endure the ſight of any vncleane thing.
                     2 For Gods wiſedome:
                        2 Gods wiſedome. who are they that ſubiect themſelues to God in all eſtates of proſperity and aduerſity? Beleeuers onely. Why then? their faith perſwadeth them that God is wiſeſt, and beſt knoweth what eſtate is fitteſt for them, and ſo euen againſt their owne ſence and naturall reaſon, faith maketh them wholly reſigne themſelues to Gods wiſe prouidence, and in that reſpect to be thankefull in all things.
                     
                         3 For Gods truth:
                        3 Gods truth he that beleeueth,Ioh. 3. 33. 
                        hath ſealed that God is true: for what maketh men beleeue, but that they iudge him who hath promiſed that which they beleeue, to be faithfull and true? Faith then is an acknowledgement, and a confirmation of Gods truth, which is an high honour giuen to God, for God maketh great reckoning and account of his truth.
                     4 For Gods power:
                        4 Gods power. many of the promiſes which God maketh to his children, are of things which ſeeme impoſſible: yet faith giueth aſſent thereunto, and thereby teſtifieth that God is Almighty, that nothing is impoſſible to him. ThusRom. 4. 20, 21. 
                        Abram by his faith did magnifie Gods power, and ſo did2 Chr. 20.12. 
                        Iehoſaphat alſo.
                     5 For Gods mercy:
                        5 Gods mercie. that is the eſpeciall and moſt proper obiect of Faith. If the poore ſinner were not perſwaded that God were rich, yea euen infinitely rich in mercy, he could neuer beleeue the pardon of his ſinnes: faith then is it which aboue all commendeth Gods mercy.
                     6 For Gods Iuſtice:
                        6 Gods Iuſtice. what maketh beleeuers ſo ſtrongly truſt vnto, and wholly rely vpon the ſacrifice of Chriſt? Becauſe on the one ſide they beleeue God to be ſo perfectly iuſt, that without expiation and ſatisfaction for ſin, there can be no hope of mercy: and on the other ſide, the ſacrifice of Chriſt being of ſuch infinite value, as to make full ſatisfaction to Gods Iuſtice, they beleeue that God will not exact that of them, for which Chriſt hath ſatisfied, but will manifeſt fauour to them, becauſe Chriſt hath purchaſed fauour for them. Theſe are points of Iuſtice, to require ſatisfaction, to remit that for which ſatiſfaction is made, to beſtow that which is merited and purchaſed. But Faith acknowledgeth all theſe, and ſo commendeth Gods Iuſtice; for it hath reſpect to Gods Iuſtice, as well as to his mercy.
                     
                        
                        Obiect. Sinners (repentant and beleeuing ſinners) vſe to appeale from the barre of Gods Iuſtice, to his mercy-ſeate: what reſpect then hath Faith to Gods Iuſtice?
                     
                        Anſwer. In regard of themſelues,How faith reſteth on Gods Iuſtice. and their owne manifold pollutions and imperfections, euen in their beſt workes, they dare not ſtand to the tryall of Gods Iuſtice, but cry for mercy and pardon: but yet in confidence of the All-ſufficient ſacrifice of Chriſt Ieſus, they may appeale to Gods Iuſtice: for God is not vniuſt to require a debt that is paid.
                     In theſe and other like reſpects, it is ſaid ofRom 4. 20.

But on the contrary, no ſinne is more diſhonourable to God then infidelity: for that which is ſaid of one particular,1 Iohn 5. 10.

                     §. 8. Of the good which Faith bringeth vnto man.
                     IN regard of mans good, Faith of all other graces is the moſt neceſſary, profitable, and comfortable.
                     It is the firſt of all ſauing graces wrought in the ſoule of a Chriſtian, as the heart is the firſt member framed in the body. Yea, it is a mother-grace, which breedeth and bringeth forth other graces, as the heart being quickned, ſendeth forth life into all the other parts.Faith the firſt grace.
                     
                     That it is the firſt,Fides eſt prima quae ſubiugat animam Deo. Aug. de agon. Chr. cap. 12. is euident: for Chriſt is that fountaine
in whom all fulneſſe dwelleth, (Col. 1. 19.) of whoſe fulneſſe al

                            receiue, (Ioh. 1. 16.) without whom we can doe nothing, (Ioh. 15. 5.) Now it is Faith whereby wee touch Chriſt: By Faith, Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts, (Epheſ. 3. 17.) The ſpirituall life which we liue, we liue by Faith in the Sonne of God, (Gal. 2. 20.) therefore till by Faith we be ingraffed into Chriſt, no true, ſauing grace can be in a man. Without Faith, it is impoſsible to pleaſe God, (Heb. 11. 1.)
                     That alſo it is a mother grace is cleare,Faith a Mother grace. for from Faith ſpringeth repentance, loue, new obedience, &amp;c. Repentance is a change of the heart, as the
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         notation of the Greeke word implyeth. Now what is it that changeth the heart of a ſinner? Is it not the apprehenſion of Gods infinite loue and rich mercy? a perſwaſion that a mans ſinnes are pardoned? The apprehenſion of Gods wrath, and feare of hell fire, may worke ſome ſorrow for ſinne committed; yea alſo it may reſtraine a man from committing many ſinnes, at leaſt for a time: but that which altereth the naturall diſpoſition of the heart, which changeth and reformeth it, is Faith in the remiſſion of ſinne:
Act. 15. 9. Loue a fruit of Faith. 
                        By Faith God purifieth the hearts of men.
                     
                     True Chriſtian loue alſo is a reflection of Gods loue to man: till a man feele Gods loue to warme his heart, and to ſet it on fire, he can loue neither God nor man. He that loueth his brother aright, muſt loue him in and for the Lord, and ſo muſt loue God before: but it is not poſſible for any to loue God, except he beleeue that God loueth him. Can a peece of yron giue heat and burne, except it be firſt heated by the fire? But our hearts are naturally more deſtitute of loue to God, then any yron of heat: they muſt therefore be ſet on fire by Gods loue, and a ſweet apprehenſion thereof, before they can loue God:1 Ioh. 4. 19. 
                        We loue God, becauſe he loued vs firſt: It isGal. 5. 6. 
                        Faith which worketh by loue. Thus I might further ſhew how all other ſanctifying graces ſpring from Faith. But what followeth from thence? ſurely this, that if any ſanctifying and ſauing grace be needfull, then is Faith eſpecially, which is the Mother of all; without it, no grace at all, no life at all: for the iuſt ſhall liue by his Faith,

By other graces, as loue, mercy, kindneſſe, wiſedome, and the like, we may be profitable to others: but Faith is it which draweth and bringeth in to our ſelues, bodies and ſoules, all the profit.

                        Iehoſaphat. When other graces, and the teſtimony of our conſcience faile, Faith may ſupport vs: for the conſcience hath reſpect to the man himſelfe, to his diſpoſition and carriage, which is ſubiect to many temptations, and many alterations: but Faith hath reſpect to GOD and his promiſes, to Chriſt and his ſacrifice, which are props, or rather rockes that neuer faile. In this reſpect is Faith fitly compared to a ſhield: for as a ſouldier who hath a good ſhield, and is able well to vſe it, will not vtterly be diſcouraged, but ſtand out in the battell, though his head-peece bee crackt, his breſt-plate battered, his girdle looſe, &amp;c: So when verity, righteouſneſſe, patience, and other like graces ſeeme to faile, he that hath ſound faith will not vtterly be quailed and confounded.
                     
                        Faith being ſo excellent a grace, as that whereby God is moſt honoured, ſo neceſſary, profitable, and comfortable a grace as hath beene ſhewed; what point of Chriſtian Religion is rather to be made knowne, is more to be preſſed, oftner to be inculcated? about what can a Miniſter of Gods word better ſpend his time, ſtudy, and paines? For Faith is the moſt proper and principall obiect of the Goſpell, which is therefore called,Rom. 10. 8.

                     AS Miniſters are moſt to preach this Doctrine, ſo are people to learne it aboue all, to be very well inſtructed in it, that they may know what true faith is: yea, to examine themſelues whether they haue in them this grace or no: if not, to enquire how it may be gotten, how diſcerned and proued: if they haue it, to labour well to preſerue, increaſe, and vſe it: for Faith is a capitall grace. We muſt therefore in this reſpect learne wiſdome of the Serpent, who hath an eſpeciall care of his head: if hee be aſſaulted and cannot flie, hee will couer his head with the reſt of his body, and ſuffer it to be ſtrucken and wounded rather then his head. Wee ought to bee the more carefull of this Head Vertue, becauſe Satan (who well knoweth the worth of it) ſeeketh moſt to aſſault it.

                        blinded by the god of this world, that the light of the glorious Goſpell ſhould not ſhine vnto them. The truth is, that no other doctrine can make men more conſcionable in performing all duty to God and man, then the doctrine of faith. From Faith proceed all good workes: For it is faith in Gods loue which moueth a man to loue God againe, and loue to God is it which moueth a man to loue his brother, which is made after Gods Image, and ſtandeth in Gods roome and ſteed. Now there can be no ſtronger motiue to ſtirre vp a man to any duty then loue: A louing childe will much more ſeeke to pleaſe his father, then a ſeruile bond-ſlaue: and a louing friend will doe much more kindneſſe for a friend, then a ſtranger, though he be hired thereunto. He that indeed beleeueth that God ſo loued him, as he ſpared not his onely begotten Sonne, but gaue him a price of redemption; that in his Sonne God hath vouchſafed to bee reconciled to him, to giue him pardon of all his ſinnes, freedome from hell and damnation, and to beſtow on him all things pertaining to life and happineſſe▪ hee that is thus perſwaded of GODS loue to him, cannot but haue his hearten arged to doe what may be pleaſing and acceptable to God: no hope of reward, no feare of reuenge can ſo prouoke a man to all good workes, as loue which Faith worketh. Beſides,
Rom. 13. 3. Heb. 11. 6. whatſoeuer is performed without Faith and loue, is no whit acceptable to God: God accepteth a cup of cold water giuen in Faith and loue, infinitly much more then thouſands of rammes, or ten thouſand Riuers of Oyle giuen in way of preſumptuous merit, or elſe of ſlauiſh feare.

                         The latter kind of ordinary faith common to all ſorts,Temporary faith. as well reprobate as elect, is that faith whereby ſuch an aſſent of the mind is giuen to the Goſpell, and to the gracious promiſes thereof, as the heart is affected with them, and reioyceth in them for a ſeaſon.Acts 8. 13. This was in Simon Magus, who in regard thereof yeelded to be baptized: and in thoſe Iewes who were willing for a ſeaſon to reioyce inIoh. 5. 35. 
                        Iohns light. This is commonly called a temporary Faith, becauſe it laſteth not for euer, but cleane fadeth away, and that for the moſt part while a man liueth here in this World, eſpecially if hee be brought to any triall.
Lu. 8. 13. Chriſt fitly compareth this faith to corne ſowen in ſtony ground. I deny not but that it may continue ſo long as a man liueth, but then with his life it endeth without any fruite, as ſmoake that cleane vaniſheth away to nothing: in which reſpectPro. 11. 7. Hypocriticall Faith. 
                        The hope of a wicked man is ſaid to periſh when he dieth. This faith is alſo called an hypocriticall faith, not becauſe hee that hath it doth onely make an outward flouriſh in ſhew, purpoſely to deceiue men; for then could not the heart be affected, nor the man reioyce therein: but becauſe it is not ſound, but appeareth both to the party himſelfe,Two kinds of hypocriſie. and alſo to others, to be better and ſounder then indeed it is: for there is a double hypocriſie, one whereby men purpoſely ſeeke to deceiue others, as theMat. 23. 14, 25.

                     THe faith which is here meant by the Apoſtle,Iuſtifying faith. is a farre more precious Faith then any of theſe: it is proper to the Elect, and by a propriety called,Tit. 1. 1. 
                        The faith of Gods Elect: for none but the Elect haue it, and all the Elect haue it at one time or another: when once they haue it, they neuer vtterly or totally loſe it, but it continueth with them till it hath brought them to the purchaſed inheritance, euen to the poſſeſſion &amp; fruition of that which they beleeued, at which time they ſhall haue no more need of it. It is therefore called ſauing Faith, becauſeEph. 2. 8. it bringeth vs vnto ſaluation; and iuſtifying Faith, becauſe it is that meanes or inſtrument which Gods Spirit worketh in vs, whereby we apply vnto our ſelues Chriſt Ieſus, in and by whomRom. 3. 28. wee are iuſtified: and ſanctifying Faith, becauſeActs 15. 9. by it God purifieth our hearts.
                  
                  
                     §. 14. Of the definition of iuſtifying Faith.
                     THis true,Definitio. ſound,There are many definitions of true faith giuen by learned and godly men, which though they differ in ſome words and phraſes, yet if they be well examined, they will bee found to agree all in ſubſtance: ſome may bee more copious, ſome more ſuccinct, yet in effect all the ſame: The Scripture it ſelfe (which was all giuen by inſpiration of God) doth oft va

                     1 It is a beleefe) this it hath common with all kindes of faith;Genus remotum. where there is no beleefe, no credence, no aſſent giuen,Many leaue out this common genus (a beleefe of the Goſpell) and in ſteed of it pu. in genus remotius, viz. a worke of Gods Spirit. But they who leaue out either of theſe, ſuppoſe them to be neceſſarily vnderſtood. Other in the forme expreſſe Chriſt alone, and not his benefits: yet they vnderſtand Chriſt with all his benefites. Some make this the forme of faith, To be perſwaded that Chriſt is his: ſome this, To apprehend or lay hold on Chriſt; ſome this, To apply Chriſt vnto himſelfe. Theſe and other like phraſes, doe in effect imply no other thing then to receiue Chriſt which word I haue the rather vſed, becauſe it is the very word and phraſe of the holy Ghoſt. (Ioh. 1. 12. Heb. 11. 17.) and as proper, pertinent, and perſpicuous as any of the reſt: for there is a receiuing on the ſoules part, as well as on the bodies. there is no faith at all.
                     2 Of the Goſpell) though the whole word of God bee the generall obiect of iuſtifying Faith,Genus proximum. yet the Goſpell is the ſpeciall obiect thereof: by it is the heart of a beleeuer eſpecially moued, and affected; and this is it which iuſtifying faith hath common with that kinde of faith that commeth neareſt vnto it, and is hardly diſtinguiſhed from it, namely a temporary faith. What the Goſpell is wee haue ſhewed
Treat. 2. Part 5. §. 4. before. The ſumme of it is plainely and fully laide downe by Chriſt himſelfe, in theſe words,Ioh. 3. 16. 
                        God ſo loued the World, that hee gaue his onely begotten Sonne,
                        Thus in all this variety we ſee there is no contrariety at all: no diſcrepancy in ſubſtance of matter, but onely in circumſtance of phraſe. 
                        that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.
                     
                     
                         3 Whereby Chriſt and all his benefits offered therein.)Againe, where ſome define faith to be a reſting on God, the difference betwixt them and other, is onely in order; for they make a perſwaſion of Gods mercy in Chriſt, to follow vpon a mans reſting on God: theſe make reſting on God (which is confidence) to follow vpon the fore-named perſwaſion: this difference therefore implieth no contradiction, or contrariety in matter. This I thought good to note, both to preuent the cauils of aduerſaries, and alſo remoue a ſtumbling blocke from the weake. Chriſt Ieſus is the ſubiect matter,Certum propriumque fidei fu

                            damentum Chriſtus eſt, Aug. Enchir. cap. 5. and very ſubſtance of the Goſpel, and ſo the proper and peculiar obiect of iuſtifying faith. Chriſt I ſay, not barely and nakedly conſidered in himſelfe (for then were he no Sauiour) but accompanied with all thoſe benefits, which as our Mediator and Redeemer he wrought and purchaſed for vs. The Apoſtle ſetteth downe foure of thoſe benefits,1 Cor. 1. 30. 
                        Wiſdome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification, Redemption: vnder which the other may bee compriſed. Theſe are ſaid to bee offered in the Goſpell.
                     1 Becauſe of the neceſſary relation betwixt receiuing and offering: for receiuing preſuppoſeth an offering.
                     2 To ſhew the ground of our receiuing, which is Gods free offer.
                     3 To ſhew that all they who receiue not Chriſt, plainly reiect him: and ſo are iuſtly condemned for reiecting him.
                     4 Are receiued) In the act of receiuing, the nature of iuſtifying faith eſpecially conſiſteth, for thereby is Chriſt made a mans owne: in this the beſt temporary faith that may be, commeth ſhort of iuſtifying faith: for all that ioy which temporary beleeuers conceiue, ariſeth not from any true poſſeſſion of Chriſt, but onely from ſome apprehenſion of thoſe great and excellent things, which in the Goſpell are promiſed. Iuſtifying faith is as it it were the hand of the ſoule, a ſpirituall inſtrument framed in our hearts by the Spirit of God, whereby we lay hold on Chriſt, and apply or take vnto our ſelues, and receiue thoſe things which God in the Goſpel offereth vnto vs.Ioh. 6. 53, 54. This word of receiuing, fitly anſwereth that metaphor of eating and drinking,
                        Mat. 26. 26, 27 ſo oft vſed in the Scripture to ſet forth the nature of Faith. Ye know that all the benefit we receiue by food, cometh from our eating &amp; drinking it: though there be ſet before a man great plenty of dainty and wholeſom cheare, yet if it be not eaten, where is the benefit of it? ſo in vaine is Chriſt with all his benefits offered, if he be not receiued.
                     Fitly alſo doth it anſwer another excellent metaphor,Ephe. 5. 32. 2 Cor. 11. 2. (namely of marriage) which is oft vſed in the holy Scripture, to ſet forth that neere vnion which is betwixt Chriſt and the faithfull. God maketh offer of his Sonne in marriage to mankinde: Chriſt came downe from heauen to be a ſuter, and to bee eſpouſed: Miniſters his friends, intreat vs in Chriſts ſteed, to accept him; when in our hearts we accept this offer, and receiue this Sonne of God to be our husband, then in truth and indeed wee beleeue, and not before.
                     Thus haue I opened this definition of Faith in the ſeuerall parts thereof: out of it two eſpeciall points are to be noted.
                     1 That euery faithfull ſoule,In Faith there is an aſſent of mind. euery true beleeuer giueth a full aſſent in his mind to the truth of the Goſpel, thatIoh. 3. 16. 
                        God ſo loued the world, that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life: ſo as heere is excluded,Iam. 1. 6. 
                        a wauering opinion (for beliefe is a ſtrong perſwaſion;) and alſo a preſumptuous conceit, (for the Goſpel isEph. 1. 13. 
                        the Word of Truth, which cannot deceiue.)
                     
                         2 That with the aſſent of the mind,2 A conſent of will. there goeth a conſent of the will: ſoas what the beleeuer conceiueth in his vnderſtanding to be true, he embraceth in his will to be good, and ſo in his heart ioyfully receiueth that fa

                        r which God freely offereth vnto him, namely, Chriſt Ie Ieſus, and in, &amp; with him all things needfull to ſaluation.
                     Thus by Gods offer of his Sonne in the Goſpel, and our receiuing of him by Faith, we come to be eſpouſed to Chriſt,Cant 2. 16. as a Bride to her Bridegroome: to be in graffed into him,Rom. 11. 24. as ſciences into a ſtocke:1 Cor. 12. 12. to be of one body with him, he the head, we the members, and ſo he and we to make one Chriſt. By the Faith here ſpoken of,Eph. 3. 17. 
                        Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts, he is ours, and we are his. This, and nothing but this is it wherewith we ſhalbe able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

                        A Shield is a generall fence for the whole body, eſpecially for the principall parts, the head and heart. There are ſundry kindes of ſhields, bucklers, and targets vſed in warre: ſome round and ſmall, ſome ſquare, ſome like an halfe moone, ſome after one faſhion, ſome after another, and accordingly they haue diuers names.

                        Application of the metaphor. able to defend the whole man from al ſorts of temptations caſt againſt him by any of his ſpirituall enemies, the fleſh, world, or diuell. By Faith the beleeuer holdeth out Chriſt himſelfe, and the power and efficacy of his obedience and ſuffering, againſt all ſpirituall aſſaults: if this defend him not from all, what can? This will keepe vs ſafe from temptations, taken from the corruption of our nature, imperfection of our obedience, innumerable number, and infinite weight of our ſinnes, from proſperity, aduerſity, or the like, if at leaſt it be well vſed. Of the well vſing of it, we ſhall§. 68. &amp;c. afterwards heare.

                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        Take, which is the very ſame that he vſed before, verſe 13. it is heere vſed in as large a ſence, both to take vp, or to take vnto one, and alſo to take againe and recouer a thing. Souldiers let not their Shield lie on the ground, but take it vp in their hands, hold it our againſt their enemies, mouing it vp and downe euery way where the enemy ſtrikes at them; if the enemy continue to fight, or renew the fight, they ſtill hold it out againe and againe: yea, if by their owne weakeneſſe, or thorow the violence of any blow, they let it fall, or ſlip, they preſently ſeeke to recouer it, and take it vp againe.
                     Thus muſt we take vp and hold forth this ſpirituall Shield of Faith againſt all the temptations of Satan: and if thorow our owne infirmity, or our enemies fierceneſſe we ſuffer it to faile and fall away, then recouer it againe, and continue to defend our ſelues with it, ſo long as wee ſhall haue enemies to aſſault vs.
                     This point of taking the Shield of Faith, reſpecteth diuerſe ſorts of people:
                     1 Them who haue it not; they muſt labour to
get it.
                     2 Them who doubt whether they haue it, or no: they muſt proue it.
                     3 Them who feare they may loſe it; they muſt ſeeke to preſerue it.
                     4 Them who are eſtabliſhed therein; they muſt well vſe it.

                     1 To commend vnto you this precious gift of Faith. For how much the more excellent the Author of any thing is, and the end which he aimeth at therein, ſo much more excellent is the thing it ſelfe.
                     2 To take away all matter of boaſting from them who haue this gift: though it be a moſt precious grace, yet1 Cor. 4. 7. it affordeth no matter of glorying to vs in our ſelues, becauſe we haue it not of our ſelues.
                     3 To ſtirre vs vp to giue all the praiſe and glory thereof to God: vpon this very ground doth the Apoſtle giue
Rom. 11. 33. 
                        glory to God, becauſe of him, and through him, and for him are all things.
                     
                     4 To ſhew that it is not in mans power to haue it when he will; that ſo ye may be the more carefull in vſing the meanes which God affoordeth and appointeth for the attaining thereto. Is it not a point of egregious folly to be careleſſe in vſing, or negligently to put off thoſe meanes of obtaining any excellent thing, which he who onely can worke and beſtow that thing, hath appointed for the obtaining thereof?
                  
                  
                     §. 19. Of the meanes of working Faith.
                     IN laying downe the meanes which our wiſe God hath appointed to worke Faith,
                     I will ſhew,

                           1 What God himſelfe doth.
                           2 What he requireth man to doe.
                        
                     
                     In conſidering what meanes God vſeth, let vs all note what order he obſerueth in making the means effectuall.
                     The meanes are,

                           Outward.
                           Inward.
                        
                     
                     The outward meanes are either ſuch as both worke and ſtrengthen Faith,The meanes of getting Faith. as the word of God: or onely ſtrengthen it, as the Sacraments. Hereof I ſhall ſpeake
§. 65, 66. heereafter.
                     Concerning the Word,
                           Gods word the outward meanes. Accenditur fidei lampas igne diuini verbi. Chryſ. in Mat. 25. the Apoſtle ſaith, r 
                        How ſhall they beleeue in him of whom they haue not heard? and therevpon thus concludeth, Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God, (Rom. 10. 14, 17.) Of Gods word there be two parts, the Law, and the Goſpel. Both theſe haue an eſpeciall worke for the working of Faith. The law to prepare a mans heart for Faith, in which reſpect it is calledGal. 3 24. 
                        our ſchoole-maſter to bring vs to Chriſt, that wee may be iuſtified by Faith. The Goſpell to worke further vpon the heart ſo prepared, and to accompliſh this worke of Faith: whereupon he termeth the Goſpel by a propriety,Rom. 10. 8. 
                        The Goſpel of Faith: and ſaith of the Epheſians,Eph. 1. 13. that they beleeued
after that they heard the Goſpel.
                     
                     
                        Queſt. Whether is the Word preached onely, or the Word read alſo a meanes of working Faith?
                     
                        Anſw. It may not be denyed but that the holy Scriptures themſelues,Preaching the Word is the moſt proper meanes of working faith. and good Commentaries on them, and printed Sermons, or other bookes, laying forth the true doctrine of the Scripture, being read and vnderſtood, may be the bleſſing of God worke Faith: but the eſpeciall ordinary meanes, and moſt powerfull vſual meanes, is the word preached: this is it which the Scripture layeth downeRom. 10. 14. 
                        How ſhall they bele
                              •
                           ue in him, of whom they haue not heard? how ſhall they heare without a Preacher?
                        1 Cor. 1. 21 
                        It pleaſed God by preaching to ſaue, &amp;c.
                        Gal. 3. 2. 
                        Yee receiued the Spirit by the hearing of Faith.
                     
                     Thus we ſee that preaching is Gods ordinance, wherevnto eſpecially without queſtion he wil giue his bleſſing. Beſides, it is an eſpeciall meanes to make people to embrace the promiſes of the Goſpel, when Gods Miniſters
2 Cor. 5. 16, 20. to whom is committed the word of reconciliation, and who ſtand in Chriſts ſteed, as though God did beſeech vs, ſhall pray vs to be reconciled to God, and make offer and tender vnto vs of all the promiſes of God.
                     The inward meanes (or rather cauſe) is the ſanctifying Spirit of God,Gods Spirit the inward cauſe. who ſoftneth, quickneth, openeth our hearts, and maketh them as good ground, ſo as the good ſeed of Gods word being caſt into them, taketh deepe rooting, &amp; bringeth forth the bleſſed fruit of Faith. The
1 Cor. 2. 4, 5 Apoſtle ſaith, that his preaching was in demonſtration of the ſpirit, that their Faith might be in the power of God. It is noted thatAct. 16, 14. 
                        the Lord (namely by his Spirit) opened the heart of Lydia, that ſhe attended vnto the things which Paule ſpake. In reſpect hereof the Apoſtle termeth the preaching of the Goſpel,2 Cor. 3. 8. 
                        a miniſtration of the ſpirit: yea, he vſeth this phraſe,&amp; 4. 13. 
                        the ſpirit of Faith, becauſe Faith is wrought inwardly by the Spirit.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 20. Of the Lawes worke towards Faith.
                     THe order which God vſeth is this,The order of working faith Firſt, hee worketh on the vnderſtanding, and then on the will.
                     The vnderſtanding he inlighteneth by his Word,1 The vnderſtanding enlightened. as in all fundamentall neceſſary points of Chriſtian Religion, ſo in two eſpecially: Firſt, in the miſery of a naturall man, Secondly, in the remedy thereof. That the Law diſcouereth.
This the Goſpell reuealeth.
                     Touching mans miſery, Gods Spirit by the Law informeth a mans iudgement both of his wretchedneſſe thorow ſinne, and of his curſedneſſe thorow the puniſhment of ſinne.
                           Mans miſery made knowne by the Law. Perlegem fit cognitio pec

It diſcouereth not onely notorious ſinnes of commiſſion, but many other tranſgreſſions which naturall men count no ſinnes; many ſinnes of omiſſion, many ſinnes of thought and heart, yea, the very ſeed of all ſinne, the contagion and corruption of our nature. Saint Paule expreſly ſaith;Rom. 7. 7. 
                        I knew not ſinne but by the Law: for I had not knowne luſt, except the Law had ſaid, thou ſhalt not luſt. The Law alſo maketh knowne the hainouſneſſe, and greeuouſneſſe of ſinne, how it is out of meaſure, yea, infinitely ſinfull, becauſe it is committed againſt an infinite Maieſty, and that alſo againſt his expreſſe will reuealed in the Law; ſo as ſinne being directly contrary to the pure, holy, and bleſſed will of God, cannot but make vs more odious and abhominable before God then any venimous Toade, Adder, or any other poyſonous creature is in our ſight.
                     Further the Law manifeſteth the puniſhment of ſin, which is Gods infinite wrath for the leaſt breach of any one branch of the commandements: for it ſaith,Deut. 27. 26. 
                        Curſed be he that confirmeth not all the words of the Law. Now the fruits of Gods wrath are all plagues and iudgements in this world, both outward in our eſtates, and on our bodies; and inward in our conſcience and ſoule; in the and death, which is exceeding terrible to a naturall man: and after all, the torment of hell fire, which is intollerable and euerlaſting: neither doth it reueale vnto vs any remedy of helpe, but rather ſheweth that we are vtterly vnable to helpe our ſelues, and that no creature in heauen or earth, is able to afford vs helpe or ſuccour; but vile wofull wretches as we are, ſo ſhall we continually remaine.
                     Thus the Law ſheweth vs to be ſuch creatures, as it had been better for vs neuer to haue beene borne, or if borne, then to haue bene any other then ſuch as we are, wretched curſed men.
                  
                  
                     §. 21. Of the Goſpels worke in Faith.
                     BVt yet by the preaching of the Goſpel,The remedy reuealed by the Goſpel. the Spirit further enlighteneth our vnderſtanding in a remedie which God in the riches of his mercy hath afforded vnto vs, and in the benefit thereof. For the Goſpel reuealeth Chriſt Ieſus, who being the true eternall Sonne of God, euen euery God, and ſo able to beare the infinite wrath of his Father, and procure his fauour, tooke vpon him, into the vnity of his perſon mans nature, wherein he ſubiected himſelfe to the Law and both fulfilled the righteouſneſſe, and alſo vnderwent the curſe thereof.
                     This is the remedy. The benefit hereof is, that God is reconciled to the world, his wrath being pacified, his fauour procured: that remiſſion of ſinnes, and deliuerance from the puniſhment thereof, both in this world and in the world to come, are obtained: that all needfull bleſſings for this temporall life, all needfull graces for a ſpirituall life, and eternal life and happineſſe in the world to come, are purchaſed.
                     Without knowledge of theſe points concerning the forenamed miſery, and remedy, it is impoſſible for any man to haue Faith: and yet may men haue, and many haue this knowledge who neuer attaine vnto Faith: ſo as this is not ſufficient: Wherefore the Spirit proceedeth further to worke vpon the will of man.
                  
                  
                     §. 22. Of Griefe going before faith.
                     TWo eſpeciall workes are wrought vpon the will:2 Mans will wrought vpō. one in regard of mans miſery, the other in regard of the remedy,
                     The firſt is to be pricked in heart,Griefe for ſin. grieued in ſoule, wounded in conſcience, and brought, in regard of any hope in our ſelues, or any other creature, euen to diſpaire: yea, and to tremble againe within and without, in ſoule and body for our ſinnes, and the puniſhment due to them. Thus wereActs 2. 37. the Iewes pricked in their hearts, and
&amp; 16. 29. the Iaylor ſo terrified with Gods iudgements that hee trembled againe, and thereby their hearts were prepared vnto Faith.
                     For the meaſure of griefe it is not alike in all, in ſome it is greater, in ſome ſmaller: yet in all there muſt be, as a ſight of ſin, and of the miſery thereof, ſo a particular ſence of that wretchedneſſe wherein we lie by reaſon of it, an vtter deſpaire in our ſelues, true griefe of ſoule, and compunction of heart for it.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 23. Of Deſire going before Faith.
                     THe ſecond worke is to deſire aboue all things in the World,Deſire of mercie. one drop of the infinite mercy of God, and to be willing to giue all that a man hath for Chriſt, accounting him more worth then all things beſide in heauen and earth, as theMat. 13. 46. Merchant in the Goſpell eſteemed the pearle which he found.
                     This earneſt deſire is in Scripture ſet forth byLuk. 1. 53. hungering,
Iſa. 55. 1.thirſting, panting, longing, &amp;c. All which imply a very vehement and vnſatiable deſire; ſo as they which haue this deſire wrought in them, will giue no reſt to their ſoules, till they haue ſome ſweet feeling of Gods loue to them in Chriſt, and ſome aſſurance that Chriſt is theirs: whereupon God who hath offered to ſatisfie the hungry and thirſty, and to ſatisfie the deſire of ſuch as pant and long after him, by his Spirit worketh in ſuch as are ſo prepared, ſuch an inward aſſent of minde, and credence vnto the promiſes of the Goſpell, that particularly they apply them vnto themſelues, and gladly accept the free offer of God, and ſo receiue Chriſt with all his benefits. This is that onely ordinary meanes, and the order thereof, which God for his part hath ſet downe to worke faith in man.
                  
                  
                     §. 24. Of mans endeauour to get Faith.
                     THe meanes required on mans part, are next to be declared. Here I will ſhew what man muſt doe that he may beleeue: and what motiues there be to ſtirre him vp to beleeue.
                     Two things are to be done of man: one that to his vttermoſt power he vſe and well imploy that ability,What man muſt doe to beleeue. whatſoeuer it be, that he hath by nature or ſpeciall gift.
                     Becauſe God in wiſedome hath appointed the preaching of his word, to be the meanes of working Faith, man muſt diligently vſe that meanes, and conſtantly attend thereupon, not giuing ouer till hee find the bleſſed worke of Faith wrought in him. A naturall man may goe to Church, and with his outward eare hearken to the Word, and wait vpon it. And becauſe prayer is a meanes to moue God to giue his Spirit, and thereby to open mans heart to receiue the Word into it, and to make his word powerfull and effectuall, he muſt alſo as well as he can, pray to God for his Spirit, and for his bleſſing on his Word. For a naturall man may pray, though not in Faith; and God doth oft heare the deſire of ſuch, as he hearethIob 39. 3. the yong Rauens when they cry for want of their meat.
                     The other,Act. 7. 1. that we reſiſt not any motion of Gods Spirit, like the rebellious Iewes, nor putte off from vs the promiſes of the Goſpel, as if they belonged not vnto vs, and thinke our ſelues vnworthy of eternall life.
                  
                  
                     §. 25. Of Gods offering Chriſt.
                     FOr motiues to make a man bold to apply vnto himſelfe the promiſes of the Goſpel,Motiues to beleeue. there are none at all in himſelfe; he muſt cleane goe out of himſelfe, and duely weigh theſe three points,

                           1 The author of the promiſes of the Goſpel.
                           2 The cauſe of the promiſes of the Goſpel.
                           3 The extent of the promiſes of the Goſpel.
                        
                     
                     For the firſt:1 It is God that made the promiſe of the Goſpel. It is God that made the promiſes: he it is that maketh offer of Chriſt Ieſus, and in him of all things belonging to life and happineſſe.Ioh. 3. 16. 
                        GOD ſo loued the World that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne, &amp;c. With what face may the creature refuſe to receiue that which his Creator offereth? Now that we may not doubt, but be aſſured that he will make his word good, we are eſpecially to conſider two properties of God. 1. His Power, 2. His Truth.
                     
                     The one ſheweth, that hee is able to doe what he hath promiſed.
                     The other, that he will not faile to doe it.
                  
                  
                     §. 26. Of Gods Power to make his offer good.
                     NO queſtion can iuſtly bee made of Gods almighty Power:2. God is able to performe his word. Nemo de Deo optimè exiſtimat, qui non eū omnipotentem, atque ex nulla parte communicabilem credit. Aug. de lib. arb. l. 1 for the Scripture expreſly ſaith; With God ſhall nothing be impoſsible. (Luk. 1. 37.) All things are poſsible to him. (Mar. 10. 27.) Which is to be noted againſt our deadneſſe, dulneſſe, and vntowardneſſe to beleeue, in regard whereof wee may thinke that a man naturally dead, may as eaſily eate and drinke as we beleeue: but when we conſider the Power of Gods might, howMa

                            3. 9. 
                        hee is able of ſtones to raiſe vp children vnto Abraham; wee may well thinkeEze. 36. 26. that hee is able to take away our ſtony heart, and giue vs an heart of fleſh. Abraham looked to Gods power, and thereby was moued to beleeue that God would performe his promiſe, though I ſaacke in whom the promiſe was made, were to be ſacrificed;Rom. 4 Heb. 11. 
                        He did not doubt of the promiſe, being fully aſſured that he which had promiſed, was alſo able to doe it.
                     
                     This motiue taken from Gods almighty Power, is in Scripture oft vſed to ſtirre vp men &amp; woemen to beleeue the promiſes of God. It was vſed toGen. 18. 14.

                        Ieremiah, &amp; to theMar. 10. 27. Diſciples of Chriſt. And it is the rather to be thought of, becauſe we are very prone by nature to make doubt thereof: for albeit in our iudgements wee are well perſwaded of Gods Omnipotency, and with our mouthes can profeſſe as much; yet when we are in great ſtraits, brought to a pinch, and ſee no ordinary meanes for the effecting the thing which wee deſire, then we thinke that God himſelfe is not able to doe it: like2 Kin. 7. 2.

                     This truth of God is to be meditated of, in regard of the greatneſſe of Gods promiſes: for when man heareth of Chriſt, and all his benefits offered in the Goſpell, hee will be ready to thinke and ſay; Oh here are ſweete and excellent promiſes, but they are too good to be true, I feare they are too great to be performed. But if that man remember how faithful and true God is that made them, it will make him thinke againe, and ſay; though they were much greater, yet God who is able, aſſuredly wil not faile to performe what he hath promiſed.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 28. Of Gods free offer.
                     
                        
                           •
                         FOr the cauſe whereby God is moued to offer Chriſt and all his benefits,4 Gods goodneſſe moued him to make his promiſes to man. it was his owne goodneſſe, and nothing elſe. Now there are two things which doe highly commend Gods goodneſſe. Firſt, the freeneſſe of his grace. Secondly, the riches of his mercy.
                     Gods grace is euery way ſo free,5 Gods grace is free. that the goodneſſe which he ſheweth to his creature is altogether of himſelfe &amp; from himſelfe.Ioh. 3. 16. 
                        God ſo loued the world, that he gaue, &amp;c.
                        Rom. 5. 10. 
                        When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God.
                        Gen. 3. 15. When there was none to mediate for vs, God offered grace, and gaue his Sonne to be a Mediator.
                     This is to be noted againſt mans vnworthineſſe, for he is ready to looke downe vpon himſelfe, and ſay; Ah, I am too too vnworthy to partake of Chriſt: what can there be in me to moue God to beftow his Sonne on me? and thus keepe himſelfe from beleeuing. But if we conſider that God reſpecteth his owne goodneſſe, and not
ours in giuing vs his Sonne; and that his grace is euery way free, that conceit of our vnworthineſſe, can be no iuſt impediment to Faith.
                  
                  
                     §. 29. Of the Riches of Gods Mercy.
                     AS for the Riches of Gods Mercy,6 Gods mercy is abundant. they are vnutterable, vnconceiuable: I may well crie out, and ſay; Oh the deepeneſſe of them! how vnſearchable are they, and paſt finding out? According to Gods greatneſſe, ſo is his mercie, it is infinite, and
                        Pſal. 108. 4. 
                        reacheth aboue the Heauens: ſo as God may well be ſaidEphe. 2. 4. to be rich in mercy, andExo. 34. 6. 
                        abundant in goodneſſe.

                         This is to be noted againſt the multitude, and haynouſneſſe of our ſinnes; which becauſe they are innumerable and infinite, keepe many men from beleeuing the pardon of them. But the conſideration of the infiniteneſſe of Gods mercy, which is as an Ocean, ſufficient to ſwallow them all vp, though they were more, and greater then they are, will vphold vs againſt that temptation: for no ſinne can be greater then Gods mercy:Mat. 12. 31, 32. The ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is not therefore vnpardonable, becauſe it is greater then Gods mercy;Gen. 4. 13. 
                        Greater then can be pardoned, as Cain deſperately thought of his ſinne; but becauſe the heart of him who committeth it, is vncapable of mercie: as if a ventleſſe veſſell be caſt into the Sea,Simil. it cannot take in one drop of water, not becauſe there is not water enough in the Sea to fill it, but becauſe it hath neuer a vent to receiue water.
                  
                  
                     §. 29. Of the extent of Gods offer of Chriſt.
                     3 FOr the extent of the offer of Chriſt,7 Gods promiſes are offered to all. it is ſo large, ſo generall, as no perſon can haue any iuſt cauſe to thinke himſelfe exempted. The Angell that brought this glad tidings from Heauen, ſaid; That it was forLuk. 2. 10. 
                        all people.
                        Ioh. 1. 6. 7 The man that was ſent from God for a witneſſe, bare witneſſe of the light, that all men thorow him might beleeue. When Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles forth to preach the Goſpell, he bid themMat 28. 19. 
                        Goe, and teach all Nations: And to ſhew that no particular man in any Nation was excepted, but euery mothers child included,Mar. 16. 15. Saint Marke ſetting down the ſame commiſſion, expreſſeth euery creature; meaning euery reaſonable creature.
                     I will not here ſtand to diſcuſſe this queſtion, whether the ſound of the Goſpel hath been heard in euery corner of the world, or no: it is ſufficient for our preſent purpoſe to know, that wherſoeuer the ſound therof cōeth, there by the miniſtery of it, tender and offer is made to euery ſoule, of Chriſt and all his benefits, euen as when theNum. 21. 8. braſen ſerpent was lift vp, a remedy was afforded to all that looked vpon it.Ioh. 3. 14, 15 Chriſt reſembleth this braſen ſerpent to himſelfe, and maketh this very application thereof. God herein dealeth with the world, as a King (againſt whom his whole kingdome, euen all his ſubiects haue riſen vp, and rebelled) who cauſeth a generall pardon to be proclaimed to all, and euery one that will lay downe their weapons, and accept pardon.
                     This vniuerſall offer of Chriſt,The generall offer of Chriſt a meanes to draw all to receiue Chriſt is an eſpeciall meanes to draw a poore ſinner to receiue Chriſt: and it is to bee noted againſt the laſt barre, wherewith men vſe to keepe their hearts cloſe ſhut from entertaining Chriſt: for when they be brought to acknowledge that God is able to performe all his promiſes; that he is faithfull, and will performe them: that it is not mans vnworthineſſe that keepeth him from ſhewing fauour vnto man, but that his owne goodneſſe moueth him thereunto, yea that the number and weight of many ſinnes cannot damme vp, and keepe backe the euer-flowing ſtreames of his mercy, they will obiect and ſay,
                     Wee know not whether we are any of thoſe perſons to whom the promiſes of the Goſpel are intended,Obiect. and for whom Chriſt indeed dyed. But for anſwere hereunto,
                     1 I exhort ſuch to learne of God by hearing him,Anſwer. and vſing his meanes how to know
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 30. That the offer of Chriſt, is aſufficient ground to receiue Chriſt.
                     2 OF ſuch I would demand what further ground they would haue to receiue Chriſt, then this, that God offereth Chriſt vnto them? wouldeſt thou (whoſoeuer thou art that diſputeſt againſt God, and againſt thine owne ſoule) wouldeſt thou climbe vp into Heauen, and enter into Gods ſecret cloſet, where his records are, to ſet whether thy name be written in the booke of life or not and then if it be, beleeue? what a prepoſterous conc
                           ••
                         is this, directly thwarting the vnſearchable wiſedome of God? God hath reſerued his eternall counſell, concerning the election of men, as a ſecret vnto himſelfe; yet hath he ordained and reuealed meanes vnto the ſons of men, by the right vſing whereof, they may come to2 Pet. 1. 10. make their election ſure: God hath alſo ſaid,Deut 29. 29. that Secret things belong vnto himſelfe, reuealed things to vs. Now marke the prepoſterous courſe of theſe men; curious they are, and ouer-curious in that which is ſecret, but ouer-careleſſe in that which is reuealed. If this be not to oppoſe mās ſhallow braine to the bottomles depth of Gods wiſdome, I know not what is. Had it not been notorious folly for any of the Iſraelites to haue lien burning with the

                     §. 31. That a mans vnworthineſſe ought not to keepe him from beleeuing.
                     SAy not therefore, I can ſee nothing in my ſelfe why Chriſt ſhould belong to me.Obiect.
                     
                     I told thee before, that thou muſt cleane goe out of thy ſelfe, and looke vpon God.Anſwer.
                     
                     But for thy further ſatisfaction herein, let me demand two things of thee.
                     Firſt, whether any man before he beleeued, ſaw any thing in himſelfe why Chriſt ſhould rather belong to him then to any other.Queſt. 1. The Scripture ſaith,Rom. 3. 33. 
                        There is no difference, for all haue ſinned, and are depriued of the glory of God. What then? Wouldeſt thou be ſingular, and haue a ground of Faith proper and peculiar to thy ſelfe? Is not this a ſpice of vaine-glory? wouldſt thou not haue ſomething to boaſt in?
                     Secondly, whether thou ſeeſt any thing in thy ſelfe why thou ſhouldeſt not beleeue?Queſt. 2. The offer of Chriſt is vniuerſall to all. Who ſeparateth thee? Obiect not thine vnworthineſſe: for who is worthy? nor the multitude and grieuouſneſſe of thy ſinnes: for he that hath feweſt and leaſt, hath burden enough to preſſe him downe to the loweſt pit of hell, if God be not mercifull vnto him. But tell me, is the number and weight of thy ſinnes an heauy burden vnto thee? doe they grieue and vexe thy ſoule? art thou preſſed downe with them? Loe here is a motiue to make thee beleeue. This is an euidence that thou art one of thoſe to whom Chriſt is giuen: for Chriſt after peculiar manner inuiteth ſuch to come vnto him, ſaying,Mat. 11. 28. 
                        Come vnto me all ye that are laden and weary, and I will eaſe you. ForLuk. 5. 32. he came to call ſinners and thereupon the Apoſtle with a vehement aſſeueration auerreth this point,Tim. 1. 15. 
                        This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Ieſus came into the world to ſaue ſinners.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 32. Of long waiting.
                     
                        Obiect. BVt many with heauy hearts haue long waited vpon the meanes, and diligently attended to the Word, and yet find no faith wrought in them.
                     
                        Anſw. We may not preſcribe any time to God: as he worketh on whom he will, ſo hee worketh when hee will:Hab. 2. 3. 
                        Though he tarry, waite:
                        Heb. 10. 37. 
                        for yet a very little while, and he that ſhall come,
                        Eſt animi generoſi perdurare quo ad Deus miſereatur noſtri. Cryſ. parad Theod. 
                        will come, and will not tarry. God neuer failed any that continued to waite on him, At length he ſatisfied their longing. RememberIoh. 5. 5. &amp;c. the hiſtory of that poore diſeaſed man that lay ſo long at the poole of
Betheſda: at length his deſire was effected, hee was cured.
                     Let me therefore (in the name of Chriſt Ieſus) prouoke euery one before whom Chriſt is lift vp in the Miniſtery of the Word, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, to looke vpon him, and to perſwade themſelues that he belongeth vnto them, and ſo receiue him into their hearts, and beleeue.
                     Neither let them ſay,Obiect. that if Chriſt ſhould not belong to them,Anſwere. they ſinne in beleeuing: for boldly I ſay againe if any vpon the forenamed grounds beleeue,None ſinne in beleeuing. they finne not: no man can ſinne in beleeuing (in preſuming, hee may ſinne, but there is a great difference betwixt Faith and preſumption, as we ſhall§. 88. hereafter ſhew)Ioh 3. 18. 
                        He that beleeueth ſhall not bee condemned,
                        1 Ioh. 5. 10.

                     §. 33. Of mans ſinne in not beleeuing.
                     
                        Obiect. FAith is not in mans power. How then can a man ſinne in not beleeuing?
                     
                        Anſw.
                        How man ſinneth in not beleeuing. 1 God gaue ability to man (when he created him after his owne image) to lay hold on any promiſe that at any time God ſhould make vnto him: ſo as God gaue him power to beleeue. But man thorow his owne default diſabled himſelfe. May not God iuſtly exact what he gaue?
                     2 No vnbeleeuer doth what lieth in him to beleeue: but faileth in ſome thing that he might doe. To omit thoſe among whom the ſound of the Goſpell came not, (becauſe now we haue not to doe with them:)Mat. 22. 6. Some perſecute orActs. 2. 13. ſcoffe at the Miniſtery of the Goſpel:
Acts 13. 45. 1 Cor: 1: 23. ſome ſpeake againſt the meanes it ſelfe, counting it fooliſhneſſe:
Luke 14. 18. ſome are careleſſe in comming to it, pretending many vaine excuſes:Mat. 3. 7. ſome come for company, or other by-reſpects:&amp; 13. 19, ſome attend not though they come:
21, ſome ſoone let ſlippe what they heare:22. ſome let the things of this world choake that which they heare: in ſomething or other all they which beleeue not come ſhort of that which they might haue done, for attaining vnto this precious gift of Faith. And that is it for which another day they ſhall be condemned.
                     3 Vnbeleefe is in a mans power: who diſtruſt and gaine-ſay the promiſes of the Goſpel, doe it of their free will: they wittingly and wilfully refuſe and reiect the gracious offer of Chriſt Ieſus. Marke what Chriſt ſaith of Ieruſalem,
                        Mat. 23. 37: 
                        How oft would I haue gathered thy children together, and ye would not?
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 34. Of the heinouſneſſe of Incredulity.
                     THus we ſee that no vnbeleeuers can haue iuſt excuſe for themſelues:Incredulity a grieuous ſinne. their Incredulity is truly and properly a ſinne; yea, it is a moſt grieuous ſinne: heinous againſt God, and dangerous vnto man.
                     As Faith of all graces doth moſt honour God,1 Diſ
                              •
                           honourable to God. ſo this of all vices doth moſt diſhonour him. It impeacheth the forenamed properties of God, namelyPſal. 78. 19, 20. his power, as if God were not able to make good his promiſe:1 Ioh. 5. 10. his truth, as if God were vnfaithfull, yea, a plaine lyer, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh:Gen. 4. 13. his mercy, as if it were dryed vp with the heat of mens ſinnes, and hisPſal. 10 4, 5. 
                        preſence in euery place, as if he were not euer by vs. It maketh a man flie from God asGen. 3. 8. 
                        Adam did, and contemne his gracious offer of pardon, as deſperate rebels and debtors: it maketh Chriſt to haue dyed in vaine: yea it is accompanied with a kind of obſtinacy, as in Thomas who ſaid,Ioh. 20. 25. 
                        I will not beleeue it.
                     
                     In regard of men,2 Dangerous to men. no ſinne ſo deadly and dangerous; it ſtoppeth the current of Gods mercy, it barreth vp heauen gates againſt men,Filios Diaholi infide litas facit. quod peccatum proprium vocatur, quaſi ſolum ſit, &amp;c. Aug. cont. ep. Pelag. lib. 3. c. 3 and openeth the mouth of hell for them, and maketh them Satans vaſſals. Whereas Faith bringeth an abſolution for all ſinnes, this layeth all our ſinnes open to the wrath of God. The truth is,Ion. 3. 18. 
                        He that beleeueth not is condemned already: and why? becauſe he beleeueth not in the Sonne of God. God hath made offer of his Sonne, but he will not receiue him. Is not this to reiect Chriſt, and to iudge ones ſelfeAct. 13. 46. 
                        vnworthy of eternall life? Wherefore to conclude this point, ſeeing there is ſo good ground to beleeue, &amp; that not to beleeue is ſo heynous a ſinne, let none dare to diſtruſt, or to put off from him the promiſes of the Goſpel: we may haue a godly ieaiealouſie ouer our ſelues, and vſe a conſcionable care in trying the truth of our Faith, (as after I will ſhew;) but to reiect the offer which God maketh of Chriſt, wee may not dare: if we feele not Faith wrought in vs, wee muſt waite till we feele it.

                     THus we ſee how Faith may be gotten:V. Point. The tryall of Faith. the next point is to ſhew how it may be prooued. Wee haue heard how pretious a thing Faith is: it doth therefore greatly behoue vs throughly to try our Faith, whether it be ſound or no.Simil. If a man goe to buy a gold chaine, hee will not be deceiued with a faire glittering ſhew, but hee will haue it toucht with the touchſtone againe and againe: but1 Pet. 1. 7. 
                        Faith is much more precious then gold that periſheth.

                     BEfore I ſhew how Faith may bee proued,Faith may be knowne. it will bee needful by way of preparation and preuention, to declare whether a Chriſtian can know if he haue ſound true Faith or no: for, many conceit that it is ſufficient to haue
a good hope (as they ſpeake,) imagining that no man can ſay certainly he hath a true Faith. If this were ſo, in vaine it were to ſeeke how it may be proued, who will labour to proue that which cannot be found out? But againſt that conceit I auouch, that The true beleeuer may know that he hath a true and found Faith. For the Saints haue profeſſed as much:Pſal. 116. 10 
                        I beleeued ſaith Dauid.
                        Ioh. 6. 69.

                        Obiect. THoſe were extraordinary perſons, and had this knowledge of their Faith, by extraordinary reuelation.
                     
                        Anſw. TheAct. 8. 37. Eunuch, and theIoh. 9. 38. blind man knew as much, and yet were no extraordinary perſons. But to ſhew that this knowledge came not of any extraordinary reuelation, proper to extraordinary perſons, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of that ſpirit which Dauid had, ſaith,2 Cor. 4. 13. 
                        Wee haue the ſame ſpirit of Faith, &amp;c. Paul had the ſame ſpirit that Dauid had, and other Chriſtians the ſame that hee, whereby they might diſcerne their Faith, and therefore he vſeth the plural number, We haue the ſame ſpirit, &amp;c. yet more expreſly he ſaith,1 Cor. 2. 12. 
                        We haue receiued the ſpirit that is of God, that we may know the things which are giuen vs of God. Is not Faith one of thoſe things? yea, it is one of the moſt principall of them? Vpon this ground the Apoſtle exhorteth vs,2 Cor. 13. 5. 
                        to proue our ſelues whether we are in the Faith, &amp;c. In vaine were this exhortation, if Faith could not be diſcerned and proued.
                  
                  
                     §. 38. Of the difference betwixt thoſe who ſeeme to haue Faith, and thoſe who indeed haue it.
                     1 Obiect. THe heart of man is deceitfull aboue all things, who can know it?
                        Ier. 17. 9. how then can the truth of any grace be diſcerned?
                     
                        Anſw. In naturall and wicked men, there is aPſal. 12. 2. double heart, wherby it cometh to be deceitful: but the faithfull haueIſa. 38. 3. a ſingle, ſimple, honeſt, vpright, perfect heart.
                     2 Obiect. Many preſume of what they haue not: yea, very hypocrites goe ſo farre, as they can hardly, if at all be diſcerned. Many of them doe more reſemble the faithfull, then counterfeit coine doth current money: for herein the Diuell helpeth mans wit. Iudas was not diſcerned by the Diſciples, till Chriſt diſcouered him.Though they which haue no faith, may be deceiued, yet they which indeed haue it, may diſcerne it.
                     
                     
                        Anſwer. If that which is counterfeit coine be thorowly tried, if it be brought to the touch-ſtone, if clipped thorow, if melted, it will be diſcerned: ſo hypocriticall Faith. But ſuppoſe ſome be ſo (I know not what to ſay) cunning or ſimple, that they deceiue others and themſelues; yet thereupon it followeth not, that he which indeed hath faith, ſhould be deceiued, becauſe he which hath it not, is: A man which dreameth that he eateth and drinketh,Iſa. 29 8. Simil. may for the time ſtrongly be conceited that he doth ſo, and yet be deceiued: Can not he therefore which is awake, and in deed eateth and drinketh, know that he doth ſo? Hee that wanteth a thing, groundeth his conceit vpon meere ſhewes and ſhadowes: but he that hath that which he is perſwaded he hath, groundeth his perſwaſion on ſure, ſound, reall euidences.
                     
                        Obiect. 3. Many which indeede haue faith, make a great doubt and queſtion of it, yea, they thinke and ſay, They haue no faith at all. How then can Faith bee knowne?
                     
                        Anſwer. That is thorow mens owne weakeneſſe,Though in a temptation a man doubt, yet out of it hee may haue aſſurance. or thorow the violence of ſome temptation. When they are ſtrengthned, and the temptation remoued, that doubting will be diſpelled. But it followeth not, becauſe at ſome times, ſome perſons are ſo exceeding weake, and ſo violently aſſaulted, that therefore they ſhould neuer know that they haue faith; or that other which are not ſo weake, nor ſo aſſaulted, ſhould not bee able to know their owne faith.Simil. In naturall matters there may be ſome, who thorow long ſickneſſe, or ſome wound, blow, or bruiſe on their head, know not what they doe: Can not therefore healthy, ſound men know? After Dauid had giuen many euidences of his aſſurance of faith, thorow ſome temptations hee doubted.

                        Queſt. CAn then true Faith ſtand with doubting?True Faith may ſtand with doubting.
                     
                     Anſw. Yea, it can: for what the Apoſtle ſaith of knowledge, may we apply to other Chriſtian graces, euen to the mother of them all, Faith;
                        1 Cor. 13. 9. we beleeue in part: The man that ſaid,Mar. 9. 24. 
                        Lord I beleeue, yet doubted: for he added,
helpe my vnbeleefe. This doubting is not of the nature of Faith, but rather contrary vnto it, ariſing from the fleſh which remaineth in vs, ſo long as wee remaine in the World:Fidei praecipua virtus in eo eſt, vt non ambigas Chryſ. in Tit. hom. 3. therefore the more ſtrength Faith getteth, the more is doubting driuen away. Yet as the Spirit in truth may be where the fleſh is, ſo in truth may Faith be where doubting is: but as we muſt ſtriue to ſubdue the fleſh, ſo alſo muſt we ſtriue to diſpell doubting.
                  
                  
                     §. 40. Of trying Faith both by the cauſes, and by the effects:
                     NOw come we to the maine point, How Faith may be proued and knowne.
                     
                     For the true triall of Faith,How faith may be proued. we muſt conſider both the cauſes, and alſo the effects of Faith: how it was wrought, and how it worketh; and compare theſe together. Moſt doe ſend men onely to the effects of Faith, by them to make triall of the truth of them: but there is an hypocriticall Faith, which bringeth forth many fruits ſo like true Faith; and true Faith is oft ſo couered with the cloudes of temptations, that if reſpect be had onely to the effects, counterfeit Faith may be taken for true Faith; and true Faith may be counted no Faith. The birth therefore and the growth of Faith muſt be conſidered iointly together, and one compared with another, that they may both of them giue mutuall euidence one to another, and ſo both of them giue a ioint and ſure euidence to a mans ſoule and conſcience that he is not deceiued.
                  
                  
                     §. 41. Of that illumination which cauſeth Faith.
                     VVE are firſt to begin with the birth of Faith:Note that many differences may be diſcerned in the cauſes of Faith after Faith is wrought, which cannot be found before faith. of the meanes and order of working Faith, I haue ſpoken before: for the proofe of Faith in this reſpect, we muſt apply the ſeuerall points before deliuered to our owne Faith, &amp; examine whether it were accordingly wrought: namely, whether it were grounded on a true illumination of the minde, in regard of mans miſery, and the remedy appointed by God: and of a right diſpoſition of the heart, both in regard of true griefe for ſinne, and true deſire after Chriſt.
                     
                        For Illumination,
                        Cauſes of Faith. it is not ſufficient that we haue a generall knowledge of the fore-named miſery and remedy,1. Illumination. that ſuch and ſuch are all men by nature, that this is the remedy afforded vnto them; but we muſt haue an experimentall knowledge of our owne wofull eſtate, as Saint
Paul had,Rom 7. 7, &amp;c when he ſet forth his own perſon as a patterne of a miſerable man,1 Tim. 1. 13. and in particular reckoned vp his owne particular greeuous ſinnes: this is it which will driue a man to Chriſt: if at leaſt we alſo vnderſtand that the remedy is ſuch an one as may bring redemption vnto our ſelues.
                     It is more cleare then needs be proued, that what Faith ſoeuer ignorant men, men that liue in neglect, and contempt of Gods Word, make ſhew of, hath not ſo much as a ſhew of ſound Faith, but is palpably counterfeit: therefore this firſt point may not be left out in the triall of Faith.
                  
                  
                     §. 42: That Griefe goeth before Faith.
                     FOr the diſpoſition of the heart,2 Compunction and griefe of heart. vnleſſe firſt it haue beene touched with a ſence of mans wretchedneſſe, and grieued thereat, it is to be feared that the pretence of Faith which is made, is but a meere pretence: for God healeth none but ſuch as are firſt wounded.Mat. 9. 12. 
                        The whole neede not a Phyſitian, but they that are ſicke.
                        Luke 4. 18 Chriſt was annointed to preach the Goſpell to the poore, to heale the brok
                              ••
                            hearted, &amp;c.
                     
                     
                        Obiect. Many haue beleeued that neuer grieued for their miſery, asActs 16. 14 
                        Lydia,
                        Heb. 11. 31 
                        Rahab,
                        Luke 23. 42 the theefe on the croſſe, and others, of whom no griefe is recorded.
                     
                        Anſwer. Who can tell that theſe grieued not? It followeth not that they had no griefe, becauſe none is recorded: All particular actions and circumſtances of actions are not recorded; it is enough that the griefe of ſome, as ofActs 2. 37 the Iewes, of&amp; 16. 29 the Iaylor, ofLuke 7. 38 the woman that waſhed Chriſts feete with her teares, and of others is recorded.
                     But the griefe of the theefe is implied both by reprouing his fellow, and alſo by acknowledging his owne guiltineſſe,
Rahab ſaith,Ioſ. 2. 11 That their hearts melted.
                     
                     
                        Obiect. That which is ſaid of Rahab, is ſaid of others alſo, who beleeued not.
                     
                        
                        Anſw. Though the ſame affection be iointly attributed to all, yet it was very different in the kinde, manner, and end thereof. The heart of others melted for feare of a temporall deſtruction: it was a worldly ſorrow; but hers a godly ſorrow, becauſe ſhee was an aliant from the common wealth of Iſrael, and out of the Church of God, and therefore ſo earneſtly deſired to be one of them.
                     
                        Lydia might bee prepared before ſhee heard Paul, for ſheeActs 16. 13, 14. accompanied them which went out to pray, and ſhee worſhipped God: or elſe her heart might bee then touched when ſhee heard Paul preach. The like may be ſaid ofActs 10 44. 45. thoſe which heard Peter when hee preached to
Cornelius, and of others. Certaine it is that a man muſt both ſee and feele his wretchedneſſe, and bee wounded in ſoule for it, before Faith can be wrought in him. Yet I denie not but there may bee great difference in the manner &amp; meaſure of greeuing. Some1 Sam. 7. 6, 
                        draw water, and poure it out before the Lord:
                        Luke 7. 38. Their heart poureth out abundance of teares.Acts 16. 29 Other tremble and quake againe with horror. Other long continue in their griefe. Other are ſo deepely wounded within, that they cannot expreſſe it by outward tears, but are euen aſtoniſhed, as with a wound that bleedeth inwardly. Other ſee in what a wretched and curſed eſtate they lie, and are greeued, and euen confounded that they can greeue no more: yet it pleaſeth God after hee hath ſhewed to ſome their woefull eſtate thorow ſinne, and touched their heart therewith, (bringing them thereby to loath their owne naturall eſtate, to deſpaire in themſelues, and to condemne themſelues, vtterly renouncing all confidence in themſelues) preſently to ſtirre vp their hearts to deſire and embrace the ſweete promiſes and conſolations of the Goſpell.
                     Faith therefore is not to be iudged by the meaſure, but by the truth of griefe, which may be knowne by the cauſes and fruits thereof.
                  
                  
                     §. 43. How Griefe which worketh Faith is wrought.
                     FOr the cauſes,Cauſes of true griefe. 1 Gods word worketh it. true griefe which worketh Faith, ariſeth,
                     1Acts 2. 37. From the word of God, whereby ſinne and Gods wrath for the ſame is diſcouered.
                     
                        Obiect. The&amp; 16. 26, &amp;c. Iaylor was humbled with an extraordinary iudgement.
                     
                        Anſwer. No doubt but he had heard the word of God before: for Paul had beene ſometime in that City, ſo as that iudgement was but as an hammer to driue into his heart the nailes of Gods word: for it is the proper vſe of Gods iudgements to beate downe the hard and ſtoute heart of man, and ſo to make him ſenſibly apprehend▪ Gods wrath denounced in his Word againſt ſinners. So▪ was2 Chr. 33. 10, 12: 
                        Manaſſeh brought to apply the threatnings of Gods word to himſelfe by a great iudgement.
                     2 From deſpaire of all helpe in our ſelues, or any other creature:2 It ariſeth from deſpaire in our ſelues. This made the Iewes and Iaylor ſay;Acts 2. 37, &amp; 16. 30 
                        What ſhall we doe? So long as man retaineth any conceit of helpe in himſelfe, all his miſery, and griefe for it, will neuer bring him to Chriſt.

                        ſinned againſt his Father.

                     2 A true and thorow reſolution to enter into a new courſe: Surely they which came to Iohn and ſaid,Lu. 3. 10, 12, 14. 
                        What ſhall we doe? were thus minded.Rom. 6. 21.
                     
                     3 A renewing of griefe,Vbi dolor finitur deficit poenitentia. Aug. de ver. pen. c. 13. ſo oft as occaſion is offered. True ſpirituall griefe which worketh Faith, is neuer cleane dried vp, becauſe ſinne, the cauſe of it, is neuer cleane taken away: Thus the griefe which breedeth Faith continueth after Faith is wrought, though not in the ſame manner and meaſure: for before Faith it cannot be mixed with any true ioy, and ſound comfort, as it may be after
Faith is wrought.
                     Many who haue no better then a temporary Faith, are at firſt much grieued, and wounded in conſcience; but after they receiue ſome comfort by the promiſes of the Goſpell, are ſo iocund and ioyfull, that they grow ſecure againe, and neuer after let griefe ſeize vpon them; no, though they fall into ſuch grieuous ſinnes as might iuſtly renew their griefe: they put off all with this, That once they grieued. Dauid, Paul, and many other faithfull Saints of God were otherwiſe affected, as is euident by thoſe
Pſal. 6, 2, 3, &amp; 32, 3, &amp; 51, 1, &amp;c.

                     §. 45. Of that Deſire which cauſeth Faith.
                     THe ſecond thing to be examined in the diſpoſition of a mans heart for the proofe of Faith,3 Deſire of Chriſt. is the Deſire
                         of it after Chriſt: greefe at our miſery without deſire of the remedy, is ſo farre from being Faith, that it cauſeth deſperation.
                     That true deſire which worketh Faith may be knowne,Proofes of true deſire. 1. By the Cauſe, 2. By the Order, 3. By the Quality, 4. By the Fruits, 5. By the Continuance of it.
                     1 It is the Goſpell,1. The Cauſe. and nothing but it, that can worke in mans heart a true deſire after Chriſt: becauſe by it alone is Chriſt reuealed and offered.
                     2 It followeth vpon the fore-named griefe for ſinne,2 The Order. and deſpaire of ſuccour in our ſelues or others.Acts 4. 12. The Apoſtle vſeth this as a motiue to ſtirre vp men to beleeue in Chriſt, that there is not ſaluation in any other.
                     
                     3 It is both an hearty and true deſire,3 The Quality. and alſo a vehement and earneſt deſire. For the firſt of theſe, it is not onely an outward deſire of the tongue, but an inward deſire of the ſoule:Pſal. 42. 1. 2. 
                        My ſoule panteth, my ſoule their ſteth for God, ſaith Dauid. This inward hearty deſire is beſt knowne to a mans owne ſelfe:1 Cor. 2. 11. for what man knoweth the things of a man ſaue the ſpirit of a man which is in him?
                     
                     For the ſecond, it is a greater deſire then the deſire of any other thing can be. No man ſo deſireth any earthlie thing, as the poore ſinner deſireth Chriſt, if it be a true deſire: therefore the Scripture vſeth ſuch metaphors to ſet it forth, as imply greateſt ardency, as hungring, thirſting, &amp;c. wherof wee haue heard§. 23. before,Num. 23. 10. 
                        Balaams ſlight wiſh could be no cauſe or ſigne of Faith.
                     4.4. The Fruits. It maketh a man carefull and conſcionable inMat. 13. 44. vſing the meanes which God hath appointed to breede faith, yea, and earneſt in calling vpon God to bleſſe thoſe meanes, and to be merciful vnto him,Luke 18. 10. 13. as the poore Publican did.
                     5 It ſtill raiſeth vp and preſerueth an appetite after5. Continuance.
                         Chriſt,Longe aberit a ſiti ſatietas, longe a ſaetietate faſtidium, quia ſitientes ſaturabimur, &amp; ſatiati ſitiemus. Aug. de Spec. c. 29. euen after we haue taſted him. Deſire after Chriſt before we beleeue ariſeth from that ſence we haue of the want of Chriſt: but after we beleeue, partly from the ſweet taſte we haue felt of him, and partly from the want we ſtill feele of him, ſo as we can neuer be ſatisfied. Hereby is the couetous mans true deſire of mony manifeſted, becauſe he can neuer be filled, but the more he hath, the more he deſireth An vnſatiable deſire of Chriſt is a good couetouſneſſe.1 Pet. 2. 2. 
                        The Apoſtle exhorteth to deſire the ſincere milke of the Word, to grow thereby: not once onely to taſte of it. If euer a man be ſatisfied with Chriſt, and begin to loath him, he neuer truely beleeued in him. For firſt, Chriſt is not like corporall meates, which with abundance may cloy the ſtomach: the more he is taſted, the better and greater will our appetite be. Secondly; no man in this world can receiue ſuch a meaſure as to be filled thereby. If therefore a man deſire Faith, and fall away, that ſeeming deſire which he had, neuer bred Faith in him.
                  
                  
                     §. 46. Of ioyning the effects with the cauſes of Faith, in the tryall thereof.
                     IF vpon that fore-named illumination of the mind, and diſpoſition of the heart, the Spirit of God hath drawne vs to accept of Chriſt Ieſus tendred in the Goſpel, then hath Faith been kindly wrought, and by this manner of breeding Faith, a man may haue good euidence of the truth of it, eſpecially if he alſo finde that his Faith doth kindely worke, and bring forth the proper fruits thereof. For Faith is operatiue,

I deny not but fire may be ſo couered ouer with aſhes, that the heat will not ſenſibly appeare, but yet heate there is within, ſo as if the aſhes be remoued, the heat will ſoon be felt: ſo ſurely, where true and ſound Faith is, there will be ſome holy heate, ſome bleſſed fruits thereof: it may for a time, through the violence of ſome temptation, be ſo ſmothered, and ſuppreſſed, as it cannot be diſcerned, but when the temptation is ouer, it will ſoone ſhew it ſelfe: if not, I dare boldly ſay, there is no true, liuing, iuſtifying Faith, but a meere dead Faith.

                           de gr. &amp; lib. arb. cap. 7. ſo to ſay, (Iam. 2. 20, 26.) It is a working Faith, which is the true iuſtifying Faith; and this is the conſtant doctrine of our Church, taught in our Vniuerſities, preached in pulpits, publiſhed in print by all that treat of Faith. That which our aduerſaries obiect againſt the orthodoxall and comfortable doctrine of Iuſtification by Faith alone, (that we make iuſtifying Faith to be a naked dead Faith, without all good workes) is a meere cauill, and a moſt malicious ſlander: for though we teach that in the very act of iuſtification,Ephe. 2. 8, 9, Faith onely hath his worke without workes: yet we teach not that this Faith is deſtitute of all workes, but that it is a Faith

                        Gal. 5. 6.

                     IT were an infinite taske to reckon vp all the fruits of Faith. For all the ſeurall and diſtinct branches of piety and charity, if they be rightly performed, are fruits of Faith. Faith is the mother of all ſanctifying graces: for by it we are ingraffed into Chriſt, and ſo liue the life of God. Euery ſanctifying grace therefore is an euident ſigne of Faith. But that I may keepe my ſelfe within compaſſe, I will draw the principal effects of Faith, wherby it may be beſt proued, vnto two heads. Firſt, a quiet: conſcience. Secondly, a cleare conſcience. This hath reſpect to that benefit which we receiue by Faith: That to the author thereof.
                  
                  
                     §. 48. Of a quiet conſcience proceeding from Faith.
                     A Quiet conſcience is that which excuſeth a man before God:What is a quiet conſcience. ſo farre it is from accuſing, that it excuſeth; whence ariſeth an admirable tranquility of minde,Nihil eft quod ita voluptatem afferre ſolet, atque pura conſcientia. Chryſ

Rom. 5. 1. for being iuſtified by Faith, we haue peace toward God. So ſoone as a ſinner truely beleeueth, he hath ſome peace of conſcience: the more his Faith increaſeth, and the ſtronger it groweth, the more peace he hath in his ſoule. From Faith then ariſeth this peace,A quiet conſcience ari

Adams conſcience in his integrity did excuſe him before God, becauſe there was nothing in him blameworthy: but ſo could no mans ſince his fall: for beſides thoſe palpable euill deeds whereunto euery mans conſcience is priny, whoſe conſcience can excuſe him in the beſt workes that euer he did?Iſa. 64. 6.

Such a ſeared conſcience had the ancient Heretiques. Now theſe two maine differences there are betwixt theſe nottroubling conſciences, and that quiet conſcience. Firſt, they onely accuſe not: this alſo excuſeth. Secondly, they lie ſtill onely for a time, at the vttermoſt for the time of this life:: this is quiet for euer, euen at the barre of Chriſts iudgement Seate.

                        Anſw. Nothing ſo: for, becauſe they had no ſure warrant out of Gods Word for that which they did, their conſcience could not excuſe them: onely it accuſed them not, and that by reaſon of the blindneſſe of their iudgement. It remaineth therefore to be a proper worke of Faith, gounded on the Goſpel, the word of Truth, to cauſe a quiet conſcience.

                        they beleeued and reioyced with ioy vnſpeakeable and glorious. This
ioy ariſeth from Faith, in regard of that benefit which Faith bringeth with it, which is no leſſe then Chriſt himſelfe, and in, and with him, all things needfull vnto full and compleate happineſſe: ſo that we may wel conclude, where true ſpirituall ioy is, there is true iuſtifying Faith.

                        The ioy of hypocrites not ſound. Their ioy is no true, ſound, ſolid ioy, but a meere ſhadow and ſhew thereof, which is euident both by the birth, and alſo by the death of it. The birth is too ſudden to be ſound: that which ſuddenly ſprouteth vp, can haue no deep rooting:Mat. 13. 20. Chriſt fitly compareth ſuch ioy to corne ſowen in ſtony ground.
                     The death of it is irreconerable, it cleane drieth vp, and vtterly vaniſheth away, which, if it had ſubſtance, it would neuer doe: thereforeIob 20. 5. Mat. 13. 21 the Scripture maketh it a property of an hypocrites ioy to be but for a moment: as dew vaniſheth away by the Sunne, ſo may their ioy by perſecution.

As ſorrow is leſſened by Faith, ſo is ioy encreaſed: but yet alwayes there remaineth a mixture of griefe and ioy, becauſe there ſtill remaineth in man cauſe of mourning and reioycing, namely, the fleſh and the
ſpirit.
                     
                     Yet this ioy is ſo faſt rooted on a ſure ground, which is Chriſt apprehended by a true and liuely Faith, that it continueth for euer, and neuer vtterly vaniſheth away. It may be obſcured by temptation, as the ſhining of the Sunne by a cloude: but as light can neuer be taken from the Sunne, ſo ioy neuer vtterly ſeuered from Faith: hee that can and will performe it, hath ſaid it,Ioh. 16. 22. 
                        Your ioy ſhall no man take away from you. Such is the power of Faith which breedeth this ioy, that the heate of afflictions cannot dry it vp, but oft times it cauſeth it to grow and increaſe: for

But yet there may be obſerued in ſuch perſons, an inward panting and breathing (which are ſignes of life▪) namely, a groning &amp; greeuing that they want thoſe fruits of Faith, and an earneſt deſire of them.
                     Such weake ones are to haue recourſe to the cauſes of their Faith, and thereby to ſupport themſelues till the winter ſeaſon be paſſed ouer, and till it pleaſe the Lord to vouchſafe vnto them a pleaſant ſpring, wherein their
Faith, may ſend forth the fore-named fruits: yet in the meane while let them obſerue ſuch fruits of Faith as vſually are in the weakeſt, namely, loue of God, and Gods children, deſire and endeauour to pleaſe God, and feare to offend him, with the like, which are branches of a cleare conſcience.

Heb. 13. 18. a faithfull endeauor to approue our ſelues vnto God:What is a cleare conſcience. and that on the one ſide by doing that which is pleaſing and acceptable vnto him: and on the other by auoyding that which is offenſiue to his excellent Maieſty, &amp; greeueth his good Spirit.
                     This proceedeth from Faith, and that in a double reſpect.
                     1 Becauſe Faith is the inſtrument wherby we draw all that vertue and grace from Chriſt our head, which enableth vs to keepe a good conſcience: I liue (ſaith the Apoſtle, meaning a ſpiritual life) By the Faith of the Son of God.
                     
                     
                         2 Becauſe it aſſureth vs of Gods loue and kindneſſe to vs, and thereby perſwadeth and euen prouoketh vs in all good conſcience to ſerue him: the Apoſtle therefore who ſaid, I liue by the Faith of the Sonne of God, addeth, who loued me, &amp;c. wherby he implieth that the loue of Chriſt made knowne to him, moued him to liue that ſpirituall life: for when a ſinner once beleeueth that God hath indeed ſo loued him, as to giue his onely begotten Sonne for him, his heart is ſo affected, asPſal. 116. 10, 11. 
                        Dauids was, thinking what to render vnto God; but finding nothing to giue, he ſeeketh what may pleaſe God, and ſetteth himſelfe in way of thankefulneſſe to doe that, (as faithfullHeb. 11. 5. 
                        Enoch who had this teſtimony that he pleaſed God,) being very fearefull to offend him, (as faithfullGen. 39. 9. 
                        Ioſeph, who being tempted to doe euill, ſaid, How ſhall I doe this and ſinne againſt God?) This cleare conſcience being a proper worke and fruit of Faith, muſt needs be a ſure note and euidence thereof:1 Tim. 1. 5. which the Apoſtle implieth by ioyning them together. They who indeed haue a good conſcience, haue a ſweete, ſenſible and powerfull proofe of the truth of their Faith. I will therefore a little longer inſiſt vpon this point, and diſtinctly ſhew,
                     1 What is the groud or fountaine of a cleare conſcience.
                     2 What the inſeparable properties thereof are.
                     3 What the extent of it is.
                     Theſe points I will the rather note out, becauſe they are further euidences and proofes of Faith.

                     THe ground-worke of a cleare conſcience is loue:Loue the ground of a cleare conſcience. for Faith giueth aſſurance of Gods loue: a ſence of Gods loue worketh loue to God: as fire cauſeth heate, ſo loue cauſeth loue,1 Ioh. 4. 19. 
                        We loue God, becauſe he loued vs firſt. And this loue ſtirreth vs vp to endeauour to haue a cleare conſcience before God. I may not vnfitly reſemble Faith, loue, and a cleare conſcience, to the ſappe, bud, and fruit of a tree:Ioh. 15. 5. the tree is Chriſt, the ſeuerall branches are particular Chriſtians: the ſap which runneth thorow all the ſeuerall branches, and is the veryHab. 2. 4. Gal. 2, 20. life of them, is the Spirit: that which receiueth and conueyeth the ſappe into euery branch is Faith: the budde which firſt ſprouteth out, isGal. 5. 6. Loue: the fruit which commeth out of that bud, and manifeſteth all the reſt, is that cleare conſcience which now we ſpeake of: both fruite and budde ſpring out of the ſappe; yet the fruit commeth immediatly out of the bud: ſo both loue and a cleare conſcience come from Faith, but a cleare conſcience immediatly from loue. Our loue to God is it which maketh vs carefull to pleaſe him, fearefull to offend him. Wherefore firſt make tryall of Faith by loue: for marke what Chriſt ſaid of the poore penitent ſinner,Luke 7. 47. 
                        Many ſinnes are forgiuen her, for ſhe loued much. What? was her loue the cauſe of the forgiueneſſe of her ſinnes? No: it was a fruit, a ſigne, a proofe thereof: her ſinnes being forgiuen, and the pardon of them reuealed to her heart &amp; conſcience, ſhe loued Chriſt, and in teſtimony of her loue waſhed, wiped and kiſſed his feete.1 Ioh 4. 19. 
                        We loue God becauſe we are firſt loued: yea becauſe theRom. 5. 5. 
                        loue of God is firſt ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt, whereby we haue a ſence of Gods loue to vs. Now becauſe God who cannot be ſeene, hath left vs a viſible image of himſelfe, euen our brother, whom he hath ſet in his owne ſteed, therefore our loue to God moueth vs alſo to loue our brother, and ſoAct. 24. 16.

Aug. epiſt. 83. which argues a ſtrong Faith,) aske him if he loue God, hee will not deny it, but ſay, Oh, I loue God with all my heart. If hee doe deny it, further aske, if he be not greeued for diſpleaſing God, if his deſire and endeauor be not to pleaſe him: or yet further aske if he loue not ſuch as he is perſwaded loue God. Few that are indeed true Chriſtians, and not ouerwhelmed with ſome violent temptations, will deny theſe. Now theſe argue a loue to God in them, which muſt needs proue that they haue Gods loue in ſome meaſure reuealed to them, and that they beleeue God loueth them, though ſenſibly they diſcerne it not.

                        1 Tim. 1. 1. 5 Theſe two doth the Apoſtle

                           •
                        oyne, and that together with Faith and loue: 
                           •
                        ea,2 Cor. 1. 12. hee

                           •
                        placeth the teſtimony of a good conſcience in ſimplicity

                              •
                           and godly pureneſſe. NowAct. 15. 9. from Faith commeth purity of heart: for Faith hath immediate reſpect to God alone, who1 Sam. 16. 7. ſeeth not as man ſeeth, butIer. 17. 10. ſearcheth the heart, and tryeth the reines, &amp; in that reſpect cauſeth a man to walk before him in truth, and with a perfect heart: therefore is true Faith called vnfained faith: ſo as hee that in truth dares ſay,Pſal. 26. 1. 
                        Iudge me, O Lord, for I haue walked in mine integrity, hath a good euidence of Faith.
                  
                  
                     §. 57. Of keeping a good conſcience in all things
                     3 THe laſt point is concerning the Extent of a cleare conſcience, which is without reſtraint, and that in a double reſpect,
                     1 Of theHeb. 13. 18. matter, in all things.
                     
                     2 Of the continuance,Act. 24. 16. 
                        alwayes.
                     
                     The generality of the matter hath reference to the rule of a good conſcience,A cleare conſcience extendeth it ſelfe vnto all things. which is his reuealed will, to whom I deſire to approue my ſelf, &amp; that is Gods word. Becauſe I deſire to pleaſe God, therefore whatſoeuer I know to be his will, I endeauour to doe. Thus did1 King. 15 5 
                        Dauid,
                        2 Kin. 23. 25. 
                        Ioſeph,
                        Luk. 1. 6. 
                        Zacharie and Elizabeth,
                        Heb. 13. 18. 
                        Paul, and many other teſtifie their good conſcience to Gods word, and therby gaue proofe of their true Faith.
                     This extent of a good conſcience reſpecteth rather the integrity of the heart, then the perfection of the work: for perfection of the worke is a full and perfect fulfilling of all the commandements of God, whereunto none can attaine in this world.
                     Integrity of heart is a true and equall endeauour to performe them all, and that though they ſeeme neuer ſo contrary to our corrupt humor: for herein lyeth a maine difference betwixt Faith vnfeined and hypocriticall. The luſts of an hypocrite rule him, &amp; preuaile ouer his Faith:
Mar. 6. 17, &amp;c. in ſuch things as croſſe not his luſts, he can be content to obey, but no further: loath he is to try himſelfe: he endureth not that any other ſhould try him.
                     
                         But vnfeined Faith controuleth all naturall conceits and worldly deſires: it maketh both reaſon and will to yeeld to Gods word and will: and ſo maketh a man ready to doe whatſoeuer hee knoweth to be Gods will: yea, it breedeth an holy iealouſie of himſelfe (asIob 1. 5. 
                        Iob had of his children,) ſo as he is very carefull in examining his heart and wayes, and willing that others ſhould trie him, yea, deſirous that God would ſift him, and diſcouer ſuch hidden ſinnes and corruptions as himſelfe cannot find out. Hence it followeth, that
                     1 For ſinnes paſt, which by his owne, or other mens, or the Lords meanes are found out and diſcouered, he is truly humbled, and giueth no reſt to his ſoule till he haue ſome aſſurance of pardon, as2 Sam. 12. 13. 
                        Dauid.
                     
                     2 For the time preſent,Pſal. 51 becauſe he findeth the fleſh ſtill remaining in him, he maintaineth a ſtrife &amp; fight againſt ſinne, asRom. 7. 15 &amp;c. 
                        Paul.
                     
                     3 For future times he is watchfull, that he be not ouertaken as in former times; asPſal. 119. 11. 
                        Dauid.
                     
                     To this integrity of heart, a faithfull man may attaine. It is that which wee daily pray for in the third Petition: it is all that God exacteth: where it is found, it is a good euidence of Faith. And it is the rather to be noted, becauſe it is both an encouragement for a Chriſtian to endeauour to doe what he can, knowing that his honeſt will ſhall be accepted: and alſo a comfort againſt his manifold infirmities and imperfections, keeping a man from deſpaire.
                  
                  
                     §. 58. Of the Continuance of a good Conſcience.
                     FOr the Continuance,
                        A cleare conſcience endureth to the end. a cleare Conſcience which proceedeth from a ſound Faith, neuer decaieth, nor yet ſtandeth at a ſtay: but rather groweth and increaſeth: as
Reu. 2. 19. Chriſt ſaid to the Church at Thyatira, I know thy loue, ſeruice, faith, patience, and workes, that they are more at the laſt then at the firſt. ThePhil. 3. 13. &amp;c. Apoſtle ſaith of himſelfe, That hee endeauoured to that which was before, and followed hard toward the marke: and thereupon exhorteth others to be ſo minded. This muſt needs be a good euidence of Faith, becauſe Faith is that which receiueth, and conueigheth in and from Chriſt ſuch ſupply of grace, as maketh the beleeuer grow vp thereby,Iohn 7. 38. 
                        Hee that beleeueth in me (ſaith Chriſt) out of his belly ſhall flow riuers of water of life. By their continuance are many which had onely a temporary and hypocriticall Faith diſcouered, who otherwiſe before they fell away, would hardly, if at all, haue beene diſcerned.
                     That conſcience which is thus grounded on Loue, accompanied with ſincerity, and extendeth it ſelfe to all things which are pleaſing to God alwayes, is that good and cleere conſcience which is ſo much commended in the holy Scripture: he that is aſſured thereof (as the Apoſtle was, Heb. 13. 18.) hath a ſenſible euidence of true Faith.
                     Thus wee haue heard how Faith may bee gotten, and proued.
                  
                  
                     §. 59: Of the iſſue of ouer-much boldneſſe.
                     THe third point is how it may be preſerued: which point is the rather to be deliuered to preuent two extreames,Two extreams whereinto many are ready to fail. The one is
ouer-ſecure boldneſſe:
                        1 Ouer-ſecure boldneſſe. the other, ouer-childiſh fearefulneſſe. For when men haue gotten and proued their Faith, ſome thorow the pride of fleſh are proane to be inſolent, and too much to boaſt of it: other thorow their weakeneſſe (which alſo ariſeth of the fleſh) to feare the decay and loſſe of it.
                     The ground of the former extreame is,Obiect. that Faith is an immortall ſeede, which ſhall neuer cleane vtterly decay, and cleane fall away. This they know, and are able to proue by teſtimony of Scripture, and euidence of reaſon.
                     But though this ground be very ſound and orthodoxall,Anſwer. yet the collection which is made from thence is vnſound, and impious: for it croſſeth Gods wiſdome, who hath ordained and reuealed meanes for the preſeruing and cheriſhing of that which hee hath appointed to continue to the end: wherefore wee are exhortedPhil. 2. 12. to worke out our ſaluation (though it be1 Pet. 1. 4. in Heauen reſerued for vs)
withfeare and trembling. But, to preuent that illuſion, let it be noted, that a man if hee make not the better proofe of his Faith, may be deceiued, and take counterfeit for current; a temporary Faith for iuſtifying Faith: which if he doe, then his ground faileth: for a temporary Faith may cleane drie away,Luke 8. 13. as the Corne ſowen in ſtony ground: witneſſeActs 8. 13. 
                        Simon Magus,
                        2 Tim. 4. 10. 
                        Demas, andIohn 2. 23. many that beleeued in Chriſt. It is likely that they which are ouerbold, neuer thorowly tried the truth of their Faith: for one note of true Faith is an holy iealouſie, leſt Faith ſhould decay.
                  
                  
                     §. 60. Of loſing Faith.
                     2 THogh true Faith cannot totally &amp; finally fall away,How farre the ſence of faith may be loſt. yet it may to their feeling be ſo farre gone, as it will make them with heauy harts to repent their proud boldneſſe, and careleſſe ſecurity. For,
                     1 It may be ſo couered ouer and ſmothered, as it cannot be diſcerned: they can for the time haue no aſſurance of it.
                     
                         2 All the ioy and comfort of it (wherewith they were formerly vpheld) may be cleane taken away, and they euen faint for want of it.
                     3 No fruits thereof may appeare, but they be as trees in winter: little conſcience of any duty, dull in hearing Gods word, cold in prayer, nothing remaining but a formall profeſſion, if that.
                     4 Their conſciences may proue a very racke, a greeuous torture and torment vnto them.
                     5 It is not like to be recouered with a wet finger, with a light ſigh, and a groane: but they may call, cry, and roare againe and againe, before they be heard.
                     6 When they recouer it, it may be they ſhall neuer attaine to that meaſure which once they had: if to that meaſure of the thing it ſelfe, yet not of the ioy and comfort of it: they may carry the griefe of this their folly to their graues.
                  
                  
                     §. 61. Of the grounds of Scripture againſt ſecure boldneſſe.
                     FOr preuenting theſe fearefull effects, they who are tempted to this extreame, muſt be very watchfull ouer themſelues, and ſeriouſly meditate of thoſe premonitions which tend to this purpoſe, as1 Cor. 10. 12. 
                        Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.
                        Rom. 11. 20 
                        Thou ſtandeſt by Faith, be not high minded, but feare.
                        Heb. 12. 15 
                        Take heed that no man fall away from the grace of God.
                        &amp; 3. 12. 
                        Take heed leſt at any time there be in any of you an euill heart of vnbeleefe in departing from the liuing God.
                        &amp; 4. 1. 
                        Let vs feare leſt at any time by forſaking the promiſe, any of you ſhould ſeeme to be depriued.
                        Mat. 26. 41. 
                        Watch and prau that ye enter not into temptation.
                        Heb. 10. 38. 
                        If any withdraw himſelfe my ſoule ſhall haue no pleaſure in him. Not without iuſt cauſe are theſe and ſuch like premonitions much vrged and preſſed by the Holy Ghoſt: for well hee knoweth how prone we are to fall away from grace. Lead, iron, ſtone, or any other earthy heauy thing, is not more prone to fall downeward, if it be not continually drawne and held vp by ſome meanes or other; nor water more ſubiect to waxe cold if fire be not kept vnder it, then we are to decay in grace, if wee bee not watchfull ouer our ſelues, and carefull to vſe all good meanes for nouriſhing and increaſing thereof. Beſides, we are ſubiect to many temptations, which are as water to fire; they will ſoone quench the Spirit, if we be not the more watchfull and carefull to ſtirre it vp. Yea, if once we waxe ſecure, ſelfe-conceited, and ouer-bold, wee prouoke God to giue vs ouer to Satan, and our owne luſts,2 Sam. 11. 2. as for a time he gaue Dauid ouer.
                  
                  
                     §. 62. Of the aſſurance of Faith.
                     THe ground of the latter extreame is,2 Ouer-childiſh fearefulneſſe. that they feele the fleſh in them, they are very weake and prone to fall away; and many in all times haue fallen away.
                     
                        Anſwer.
                        Aſſurance in Chriſt. Theſe that are thus tempted, muſt know that the cauſe of our aſſurance is not in our ſelues, but in Chriſt our head; as we lay hold of him, ſo he faſt holdeth vs: for there is a double bond whereby we are knit vnto Chriſt, one on Chriſts part, the other on ours. That, is the
Spirit of Chriſt:1 Iohn 4. 13 
                        Hereby wee know that wee dwell in him, and he in vs, becauſe he hath giuen vs of his Spirit. This, is our
Faith: forEph. 3. 17. 
                        Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts by Faith: Now though our Faith ſhould let goe her hold, yet Chriſts Spirit wōld not let go his hold. This ground of aſſurance the Scripture expreſly declareth: for ſaith Chriſt,
                        Ioh. 10. 27. 28. 
                        I know my ſheepe, I giue vnto them eternallife, and they ſhall neuer periſh:
                         now marke the reaſon, There ſhall not any plucke them out of my hand: My Father which gaue them me is greater then all, and none is able to take them out of my Fathers hand. Wherefore the Diuell and all his adherents can doe no more, to put out the light of Faith, and plucke vs from Chriſt, then all Creatures on Earth can to extinguiſh the light of the Sunne. For why? The Sun from whence this light commeth, is farre aboue all, they cannot come at it: So Chriſt on whom our Faith is founded, is farre aboue all our enemies. Chriſt muſt be plucked out of Heauen, if true Faith vtterly fall away.
                     2 Let the fore-named weake ones conſider,The power of Chriſts Spirit n the weakeſt that as the fleſh is in them to make them weake, ſo alſo the power of Chriſts Spirit is in them to make them ſtrong. Though the ſpirit ſuffer the fleſh ſometimes to preuaile; it is not becauſe the fleſh is ſtronger then the ſpirit, or the ſpirit weaker then the fleſh; but becauſe the Spirit in wiſdome will haue vs ſee our weakeneſſe, ſee in what need we ſtand of the power of God, flie to God, depend vpon him: and at length the Spirit will preuaile, and get full conqueſt:
                     3 As for the fals of other, wee know not what they were in truth.
                  
                  
                     §. 63. Of the grounds of Scripture for perſeuerance.
                     TO be freed from this laſt temptation, they which are ſubiect thereunto, muſt ſeriouſly ponder thoſe ſcriptures which ſet forth the certainty and perſeuerance of
Faith; which are ſuch as theſe,Iohn 5. 24. 
                        He that beleeueth, hath euerlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death vnto life.
                        &amp; 4. 14. 
                        He that drinketh of the water that I ſhal giue him, ſhall neuer thirſt: but the water that I ſhall giue him, ſhal be in him a well of water ſpringing vp into euerlaſting life.
                        1 Iohn 5. 4. 
                        This is the victory that ouercommeth the World, euen our Faith.
                        1 Pet. 2. 6 
                        Hee that beleeueth on Chriſt ſhall not be confounded.
                        Pſal. 125. 1. 
                        They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount Zion, which cannot be remoued, but abideth for euer. The grounds of this ſtability of Faith are in the Scripture noted to be theſe,
                     1 The conſtancy of Gods loue, mercy, truth, couenant, calling, gifts, and the like; which is ſet forth by theſe, and ſuch like promiſes as theſe be:
                        Ier. 31. 3. I haue loued thee with an euerlaſting loue.Iſa. 54. 8. With euerlaſting kindneſſe will I haue mercy on thee.2 Sam. 7. 15 My mercy ſhall not depart away from him.Pſal. 132. 11 The Lord hath ſworne in truth, hee will not turne from it.Ier. 32. 40. I will make an euerlaſting couenant with them.Rom 11. 29. The calling and gifts of God are without repentance.
                     2 The perpetuall efficacy of Chriſts interceſſion, manifeſted in one particular example, which is to be applied to all his Elect: for what he ſaid to Peter, (Luke 22. 32. 
                        I haue praied that they Faith faile not) he performeth for all.
                     3 The continuall aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt: in which reſpect it is ſaid, ThatIohn 14. 16. 
                        hee ſhall abide with vs for euer, and thatPhil. 1. 6. 
                        hee which hath begunne a good worke, will finiſh it. If well we weigh and apply theſe and ſuch like teſtimonies of Scripture, though we worke out our ſaluation with feare and trembling, yet ſhall we not be fearefull and doubtfull of the iſſue.
                  
                  
                     §. 64. Of preſeruing and encreaſing Faith.
                     AS a preſeruatiue againſt thoſe two poyſonous potions, and as a meanes to keepe vs in the right way from falling into any of the two extreames, diligent care muſt bee vſed to preſerue and encreaſe this precious gift of Faith: for if Faith be kept aliue, ſo as it may beare ſway in vs, it will keepe vs both from boaſting and doubting.
                     
                         Two eſpeciall points there be which make to this purpoſe.VI. Point. How Faith may be preſerued and increaſed.
                     
                     1 A conſcionable and conſtant vſe of the meanes which God to this end hath appointed.
                     2 Faithfull and hearty prayer for Gods bleſſing on thoſe meanes.
                     The meanes are two. Firſt, the miniſtery of Gods Word. Secondly, the adminiſtration of the Sacraments.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 65. Of vſing the word for increaſe of Faith.
                     VVEe haue heard before how Faith was bred by the word;1. By the word now the word is like to a kind natural mother, which giueth ſucke to the child which ſhee hath brought forth: whereupon ſaith the Apoſtle, As new borne babes deſire the ſincere milke of the word,

                            1 Pet. 2. 2 
                        that yee may grow thereby. He had ſaid before, That we were&amp; 1. 23. 
                        borne anew by the word of God: Here hee ſheweth that the Word hath a further vſe; namely, to make vs grow. For by the Word the promiſes of God (which at firſt were made known vnto vs, and whereby Faith was bred) are againe and againe brought to our remembrance, the tender and offer of them oft renewed; ſo as thereby our Faith (which otherwiſe might languiſh away thorow our own weakeneſſe, and Satans temptations) is not onely preſerued, but exceedingly quickened, ſtrengthened, and increaſed.

                         Our care therefore muſt be diligently to frequent the publike miniſtery of the Word;
 for by it Chriſt is lift vp in the Church, as the braſen Serpent was in the Wilderneſſe. Yea, alſo to reade and ſearch the Scriptures in Families, and with our ſelues alone. We heard§. 24. before that we muſt attend on the Word, till we find Faith wrought in vs.
                     
                         Here we further learne neuer to giue ouer, but ſo long as our Faith hath neede to be confirmed and increaſed (which will be ſo long as we liue in this world,) to vſe the Word. Wee may not therefore thinke it ſufficient that we haue had this benefit of the Word to beleeue: we muſt labour for a further benefit, to be eſtabliſhed and confirmed thereby more and more in our moſt holy Faith.

                     THe Sacraments are purpoſely added for this end,2 By the Sacraments. to ſtrengthen our Faith, which they doe two wayes. Firſt, they are GodsRom. 4. 11. 
                        ſeales added vnto his word, that by two immutable things (Gods promiſe, and Gods ſeale) wherein it is impoſſible that God ſhould lie) wee might haue ſtrong confidence. Secondly, they doe as it were viſibly ſet before our eyes the ſacrifice of Chriſt (which is the ground-worke of our Faith) ſo as in, and by them Ieſus Chriſt is euenGal. 3 1. 
                        crucified among vs.Rom. 4. 11. The Apoſtle noteth, that Abram after he beleeued, receiued the ſigne of circumciſion: &amp; withal rendreth the reaſon becauſe it was
a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of the Faith which he had: therefore it ſerued to the confirmation and preſeruation of his Faith. To this endActs 8. 37. 
                        Philip baptized the Eunuch after he beleeued.

                         God in wiſedome hauing ordained theſe meanes to cheriſh our Faith,
 we ought to bee conſcionable in a frequent vſe of them, otherwiſe ſhall we ſhew our ſelues rebellious againſt GOD, and iniurious to our owne ſoules.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 67. Of prayer for increaſe of Faith.
                     2 PRayer is that meanes which God hath appointed to obtaine all grace,3 By prayer. all ſtrength of grace, yea and a bleſſing vpon all his ordinances (as I willTreat. 3. part. 1. §. 20. after ſhew) ſo that it muſt needs in that reſpect be a notable preſeruatiue of Faith. Beſides, by prayer wee make our ſelues after an holy manner familiar with God, and ſo haue more and more euidence of Gods loue and fauour to vs, whereby our Faith muſt needs be much ſtrengthened. When Satan deſired to winnow the Apoſtles, what meanes did Chriſt vſe to preſerue Peters Faith:Luk. 
                              •
                           2. 32. 
                        I haue prayed (ſaith he to Peter) for thee that thy Faith faile not. Thereby Chriſt alſo teacheth vs what we muſt do to preſerue our Faith. After that once Faith is bred in vs, in Faith we may pray that it faile not, but we cannot ſo pray to get Faith. A man that heareth the ſweet promiſes of the Goſpel, and withall heareth that Faith is that meanes whereby the benefit of them is receiued, may earneſtly wiſh for Faith, and deſire God to giue it him: but in Faith (which yet he hath not) he cannot pray for Faith, as after he hath it, he may for the preſeruation of it: therefore faithfull prayer is a proper meanes to cheriſh, keepe, ſtrengthen and increaſe Faith.
                  
                  
                     §. 68. Of well vſing Faith.
                     THe laſt point obſerued out of this exhortation is,VII. Point. How faith may bee well vſed;
                        How Faith may be well vſed.
                     
                     The Apoſtle doth not ſimply ſay, Take Faith, but addeth this reſemblance ſhield, ſaying, Take the ſhield of faith: teaching vs thereby that we muſt vſe Faith as ſouldiers vſe their ſhield. I ſhewed before how ſouldiers vſe to hold out their ſhields againſt all the aſſaults and weapons of their enemies: to keepe themſelues ſafe, they vſe to lie vnder their ſhields, and ſo couer and defend their bodies: thus muſt we ſhelter our ſoules by Faith, holding it out againſt all ſpirituall aſſaults, and (as I may ſo ſpeake) lie euen vnder it.Faith is vſed as a ſhield by reſting on gods promiſes This in general is done by reſting on Gods promiſes, which are the ground-worke and rocke of our Faith. For by true Faith we doe not onely giue credence to the truth of Gods promiſes, but alſo truſt to them, and build vpon them, aſſuring our ſelues that they ſhall be effected to our good, and2 Chro. 20. 20 ſo remaine ſecure whatſoeuer fall out.
                     This vſe is to be made of Faith, both in proſperity, and in aduerſitie.
                  
                  
                     §. 69. Of the vſe of Faith in proſperity.
                     IN proſperity Faith hath a double vſe.
                     1 It maketh vs acknowledge that it is the Lord which hath ſo diſpoſed our eſtate,Two vſes of faith in proſperity.
                        1 King. 8. 20. 24. as Salomon did, ſaying,
The Lord hath made good his word, &amp;c.
                     
                     For Faith hauing an eye to the promiſes of God, and exerciſing it ſelfe about them, when any good thing falleth out, it attributeth and applyeth it to ſuch and ſuch a promiſe, and ſo acknowledgeth it to be brought to paſſe by the word and prouidence of God.
                     2 Faith maketh vs reſt vpon God for the time to come, that all ſhall goe well with vs,Pſal. 16. 5. &amp;c. as Dauid did. For it maketh a man thus to reaſon: God hath made many faithfull promiſes neuer to faile or forſake them that truſt in him. He hath hitherto made good his word to me. He ſtill remaineth the ſame God, true and faithfull. I will therefore trouble my ſelfe with vndue feares. I feare no euill; but beleeue that it ſhall euer go well with me. Hereupon alſo faithfull parents exhort their children to truſt in God: yea quietly they commend their owne ſoules into Gods hands, and commend their children to Gods prouidence, and that vpon this ground, exhorting them alſo to depend on God, as Dauid did, 1 Chr 22. 11. and 28. 9.) ForHabet fides o culo▪ ſuos quibus quodammodo videt verum eſſe quod nondum videt. Aug. epiſt. 85. 
                        faith hath eyes whereby it doth after a maner ſee that to be true, which yet it ſeeth not.

                     IN aduerſity it hath alſo a double vſe.
                     1 It vpholdeth vs in the preſent diſtreſſe, when elſe we know not what doe: inſtance Dauid (1 Sam. 30. 6.) and
Iehoſaphat (2 Chr. 20. 12.)
                     2 It moueth vs patiently toOſe. 6. 1, 2. waite for deliuerance: for God hauing promiſed to giue a good iſſue, Faith reſteth vpon it, euen as if it were now accompliſhed.
                     Thus in generall we ſee how Faith hath his vſe alwaies in all eſtates.
                  
                  
                     §. 71. Of oft calling to minde Gods promiſes.
                     I Will furthermore particularly ſhew how we come to ſhelter our ſoules vnder Faith.Two helpes of Faith. For this, two eſpeciall things are requiſite.
                     1 A faithfull remembrance of Gods promiſes.
                     2 A wiſe and right application of them.
                     For the firſt, Dauid 
                        h 
                        hid Gods promiſes in his heart: thus it came to paſſe that thoſeRemembrance of p

                           50. and he receiued admirable comfort by them. Aſſuredly if the beleeuer doe call to mind Gods promiſe of ſuccour and redreſſe in his diſtreſſe, it will quiet him for the time, and make him reſt in hope till he enioy the accompliſhment of that promiſe.It is dangerous to forget Gods promiſes. While a beleeuer well remembreth, and duely conſidereth what great and excellent promiſes are made, how mighty, faithful and mercifull he is that made them, hee thinketh that the world may be as ſoone ouerthrowne, as his Faith. But the letting of Gods promiſes ſlip out of his memory, is that which maketh him faint. The Apoſtle hauingHeb. 12. 3, 5. ſecretly intimated vnto the Hebrewes their fainting, declareth the cauſe thereof,Sicut lucerna niſi ei ſubminiſtraueris oleum extinguetur, ſic fides niſi aſſiduis nutriatur meditationibus ſcripturarum. Chryſ. in Mat. 25. by telling them they forgat the conſolation: for that which is not remembred, is as not knowne. Now Gods promiſes being the ground and very life of Faith, what vſe of Faith can there be, if Gods promiſes be vnknowne, or (which for the time is all one,) not remembred? As a lamp wil ſoon be out, if oyle be not continually ſupplyed: ſo Faith, if it be not nouriſhed with continuall meditation of Gods promiſes, will ſoone faile.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         By way of exhortation let vs be ſtirred vp to ſearch Gods word,
 where his promiſes are treaſured vp: and note what promiſes are there made for our comfort and encouragement: yea let vs vſe the helpe of others, eſpecially of thoſe to whomIſa. 50. 4. 
                        God hath giuen the tongue of the learned: yea (among and aboue all others) of them whom God hath placed in his ſteed, to whom2 Cor. 5. 19, 20. he hath committed the word of reconciliation: let vs vſe their helpe for the finding out of Gods promiſes, and hauing knowledge of them, oft meditate and thinke on them, that ſo they may be the more firmely imprinted in our memories, as in a good treaſury and ſtore houſe, and the more ready to be brought forth for our vſe; like thatMat. 13. 52.

Deut. 6, 7. &amp;c. God therefore preſcribed vnto his people diuers helpes for their memories.
                  
                  
                     §. 72. Of well applying Gods promiſes.
                     IN the ſecond particular helpe (which is wiſe and right application of Gods promiſes) conſiſteth the greateſt vſe of Faith,2 Right application. for which we haue need of the Spirit of wiſedome and reuelation.
                     
                     The promiſes of the Word are declarations of Gods fauour towards man, and of his prouidence ouer him for his good: for it pleaſed God as to take care of man, and to prouide for him all things needfull, ſo before
                           •
                         hand to make faithfull promiſes to him thereof, to vphold him till the time of the accompliſhment of them.
                     Now for the better application of them, wee are to conſider both the promiſes themſelues, and the perſons to whom they are made.
                     In the promiſes three things are to be obſerued. Firſt, the matter contained in them. Secondly, the kinde or quality of them. Thirdly, the manner of propounding them.
                     The matter of Gods promiſes,Generall promiſes. is either generall, concerning ſupply of all good things, and deliuerance from all euill: or particular, concerning the ſeuerall particular eſtates, and needs of men.
                  
                  
                     §. 73. Of applying generall promiſes.
                     THat firſt promiſe which God made to man after his fall (Gen. 3. 15. 
                        He ſhall breake thine head,) was a generall promiſe: for by it is promiſe made of Chriſt Ieſus, and of that full redemption which Chriſt ſhould make of man. So that promiſe which God made to Abram (Gen. 22. 18. 
                        In thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed:) Heere is all happines in Chriſt promiſed to all the faithfull. And that which the Apoſtle ſetteth downe,Rom. 8. 28. 
                        All things ſhall worke together for the good of them that loue God, &amp;c. And again,
1 Cor. 3. 22. 
                        All things are yours: that is, all things tend to your good, and helpe forward your happineſſe and ſaluation. Many other like generall promiſes there be in the Scripture,Why general promiſes are to be obſerued. which are the rather to be remembred, becauſe they extend themſelues to all eſtates, to all conditions, and to all kinde of diſtreſſes whatſoeuer; ſo that if we cannot call to mind particular promiſes, fit for our preſent eſtate, we may vphold our ſelues with theſe generall promiſes. For example,Gen. 3. 15. when the diuell or any of that ſerpentine brood ſhall aſſault vs, remember we that all that they can doe, is but to nibble at our heeles, he ſhall neuer be able to cruſh our head, to deſtroy our ſoule: yet his head ſhall be cruſhed, he vtterly vanquiſhed. If we be in any miſery, remember we that bleſſedneſſe is promiſed vnto vs,Gen. 22. 18. and bleſſed ſhall we be. If any thing ſeeme to make againſt vs,Rom. 8. 28. this is promiſed to be the iſſue, that all ſhal turn to our good.
                  
                  
                     §. 74. Of applying particular promiſes.
                     PArticular promiſes fit for our particular eſtates and needs are added to the general,Why particular promiſes

                           dfull. becauſe we are weake and ſubiect to ſlip, and cannot well apply, and reſt vpon the generall promiſes. Theſe are very many, I will endeauor to draw them to ſome diſtinct heads.
                     They concerne this life, or the life to come. Thoſe for this life are of temporal, or ſpirituall bleſſings. For the life to come, heauenly and glorious things are promiſed.

                        God ſhall fulfill all your neceſsitie, &amp;c. Beſides, there are other particular promiſes fitted to our ſeuerall neceſſities: to ſuch as want meat, drinke or apparell, Chriſt hath ſaid,Mat. 6. 25. 32▪
                         
                        Bee not carefull for your life, what ye ſhall eate, or what ye ſhall drinke, nor yet for your body what ye ſhall put on, &amp;c. your heauenly Father knoweth that ye haue need of all theſe things. They which deſire to haue yet more particulars, let them reade
Leu. 26. 4, 5. &amp;c. and Deat 28. 3, 4. &amp;c.
                     
                     In the Scripture are further to be found particular promiſes for Orphans, Widowes, Captiues, &amp;c. likewiſe for time of warre, famine, ſickneſſe, &amp;c.
                     If now we want any needfull thing, the vſe of Faith is to make vs reſt vpon theſe and ſuch like promiſes: for if they be rightly beleeued, they will make vs caſt our care on God that careth for vs, and moderate our immeaſurable carking aftet them; mouing vs patiently to waite for the accompliſhment of our deſire, or contentedly to want what God denyeth.
                     
                        For remouing things hurtfull, and deliuering vs out of troubles, God hath expreſly ſaid,

                     For ſpirituall matters, we haue many moſt comfortable promiſes, as thatIer. 31. 33. &amp;c.
                         
                        God will be our God, wee ſhall be his people, we ſhall all know him: he will forgiue our iniquities: he will write his Law in our heart:

                     The vſe of Faith here is to vphold vs againſt our manifold defects, infirmities, and imperfections. For firſt it giueth euidence to our ſoules, that the graces wee haue are the gifts of God, becauſe God promiſeth them. Secondly, it maketh vs reſt on God for perfecting of that good worke which he hath ſo graciouſly begun;2 Tim. 1. 11▪

                     For promiſes of heauenly things, the Scripture is euerie where plentifull: thatLuke 23. 43 the ſoule ſhall at the diſſolution of the body goe immediately to Heauen, that1 Cor. 15. 22 the body ſhall riſe againe, andPhil. 3. 21. be made like to the glorious body of Chriſt: and weMat. 25. 34. enioy euerlaſting happineſſe, with the like.
                     The vſe of Faith in regard of theſe, is to vphold vs with the expectation of that heauenly happineſſe which is promiſed, yea, though wee bee here deſtitute of worldly things, and in many troubles and tribulations.

                     The vſe of Faith in theſe, is to vphold vs againſt all feare and doubt, euen when we haue not a ſenſible feeling of them: for God (who is able to performe whatſoeuer he hath promiſed; and true and faithfull in all his promiſes) hauing abſolutely promiſed ſuch &amp; ſuch things, though all things in Heauen and Earth ſhould ſeeme to make againſt them, yet would Faith beleeue them.
                  
                  
                     §. 76. Of applying conditionall promiſes.
                     OTher promiſes are conditionall,2 Conditionall promiſes. which are no further promiſed then God in wiſdome ſeeth to be moſt meete for his owne glory, and his childrens good. Thus are promiſed,
                     1 All temporall bleſſings,Luk. 16. 20. which Lazarus an holy Saint wanted.
                     2 Freedome from all croſſes and troubles. What Saint hath not had his part in ſome of them? who hath been freed from all?
                     3 Freedome from all temptations. As our head was tempted, ſo haue his members from time to time.
                     4 Leſſe principall graces, which are called reſtraining graces, being giuen rather for the good of others, then of them who haue them.1 Cor. 12. 8, &amp;c. Theſe the Spirit diſtributeth ſeuerally, not all to euery one, but ſome to one, ſome to another.
                     5 The meaſure of ſanctifying graces: for though euery Saint hath euery ſauing grace in him, yet hath he not a like meaſure: ſome haue a greater, and ſome a leſſe.
                     Admirable is the vſe of Faith in theſe conditionall promiſes:The vſe of Faith in conditionall promiſes. for it maketh vs ſo to truſt to Gods power, as we ſubiect our ſelues vnto his will; asMar. 1. 40. the Leaper, who ſaid; If thou wilt thou canſt make me cleane; andDan. 3. 17, 18 thoſe three conſtant ſeruants of God, who ſaid; Our God is able to deliuer vs from the hot fiery Furnace, and hee will deliuer vs out of thine hand O King. But if not, be it knowne to thee O King, that wee will not ſerue thy gods, &amp;c. For Faith perſwadeth vs that God is wiſer then our ſelues, and that he better knoweth what is good for vs then we our ſelues doe, and ſo moueth vs to reſigne vp our ſelues wholly to Gods good pleaſure.
                     This is the generall vſe of Faith in reſpect of theſe conditionall promiſes, it hath alſo other particular vſes, as
                     1 For temporall things, ſo to reſt on Gods promiſe, as we beleeue God will either ſupply our wants, or inable vs to beare them: as God had taught Paul

                        2 Cor. 12. 9. 
                        My grace is ſufficient for thee.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 77. Of applying implicit promiſes.
                     FOr the manner of propounding Gods promiſes,The diuers māner of ſetting downe Gods promiſes. they are either expreſly declared, or elſe by conſequence implied. Expreſſe promiſes are either generally propounded to all: of theſe we haue heard before; or elſe particularly applied to ſome particular perſons. Some of theſe are ſuch as are not proper to him alone to whom in particular they are directed; but for the good of others alſo. If we find ſuch needfull for vs, it is the vſe of Faith to apply them to our ſelues with as ſtrong confidence as if they had beene directed to vs. ThisHeb. 13. 5. the Apoſtle teacheth vs to doe: for where God made a promiſe to Ioſhuah, (Ioſ. 1. 9. 
                        I will not faile thee, &amp;c.) the Apoſtle applieth it to all Chriſtians. The ground of this application is taken from Gods vnchangeable and impartiall manner of dealing: the ſame God that he is to one faithfull man, the ſame he is to all. If therefore he would not faile I
                              •
                           ſhuah, neither will he faile any.
                     By conſequence promiſes are implied, either in the examples, or prayers of faithfull Saints.
                     
                        In their examples, by thoſe bleſſings which they haue enioyed. For that which God beſtoweth on one, he is ready to beſtow on euery one to whom it is needfull: Gods giuing it to one, is a promiſing of it to all. So as we may with as ſtrong confidence depend vpon God for ſuch needfull things, as if God had expreſly promiſed them. Thus dothIam. 5. 11. Saint Iames vrge that end which God gaue to Iobs troubles, as a ground of our Faith, to make vs waite for a like deliuerance in our troubles.
                     
                        In their prayers, by thoſe things which they haue praied for in Faith and obtained. Their faithfull calling vpon God, and Gods gracious hearing of them, are as much as a promiſe, that God in ſuch and ſuch things will heare vs calling vpon him: thus did Dauid make this a ground of his faith. Pſal. 22. 5.
                     The vſe of Faith in theſe implicit promiſes is to perſwade our hearts that God will deale with vs as hee hath in former times dealt with his faithfull children.
                  
                  
                     §. 78. Of the true Heires of Gods promiſes.
                     THe laſt point to be noted for the right application of Gods promiſes, is the perſons to whom they belong. Here note two points.
                     1 Who are the righteous heires and children of Gods promiſes.The perſons to whō Gods promiſes belong.
                     
                     2 How theſe heires are qualified.
                     1 For the firſt, Chriſt Ieſus the true naturall Sonne of God, as hee was Emanuel, God with vs, our Head and our Redeemer, is properly the heire of all Gods promiſes,
2 Cor. 1. 20. 
                        In him they are, yea, and Amen. That is to ſay; In him they are propounded, ratified, and accompliſhed. This is euident by thoſe generall promiſes which are the foundation of all the reſt.Gen. 3. 15. 
                        He, (that is, Chriſt) ſhall breake thine head.
                        &amp; 22. 18. 
                        In thy ſeede (Gal. 3. 16. that is, Chriſt) ſhall all the Nations of the Earth 
                              •
                           e bleſſed. Now how is Chriſt the heire of Gods promiſes? as a priuate perſon? onely in himſelfe? No verily: but as a publike perſon, as the head of a body: for Ieſus together with all the Saints, which were giuen him of his Father, make but one myſticall body,1 Cor. 12. 12 
                        which is Chriſt: ſo as all the faithfull together with Chriſt are heires of the promiſes; they, and they alone haue a right vnto them: ſo as what the Apoſtle ſaith of godlineſſe. I may fitly apply to Faith, which is the Mother of all Godlines,
                        1 Tim. 4. 8. 
                        Faith is profitable vnto all things, which hath the promiſe of the life preſent, and of that which is to come. Both generall and particular promiſes, promiſes of earthly, ſpirituall, and heauenly things; conditionall, and abſolute promiſes: all promiſes belong to the faithfull.
                  
                  
                     §. 79. Of applying Gods promiſes to the right perſons.
                     2 FOr the ſecond, the ſeuerall conditions and qualities of the perſons to whom ſeuerall promiſes are made, are exceeding many. Sometimes they are made to Faith, ſometimes to obedience, ſometimes to vprightneſſe, to cheerefulneſſe, to conſtancy, to loue, to feare; to ſuch as mourne, hunger, are heauy laden; to ſuch as pray, heare Gods Word, keepe his Commandements; to the fatherleſſe, widowes, captiues, poore, ſicke, &amp;c. It is not poſſible, neither yet is it needfull that I ſhould reckon vp all: they are here and there to be found throughout the Scripture.
                     The vſes of Faith in reſpect of the perſons to whom the promiſes are made, are theſe.
                     1 To aſſure vs that we are they to whom they appertaine.
                     2 To make vs apply them to thoſe ſeuerall qualities which we find in our ſelues, as if we hunger, to beleeue we ſhall be ſatisfied; if we mourne, that we ſhall be comforted, and ſo in the reſt.
                     To make vs expect the accompliſhment of them, according to our ſeuerall needs: as when we are in any trouble, to expect deliuerance; when tempted, aſsiſtance; when in want, releefe, &amp;c.
                     
                     Thus (as diſtinctly as I can) haue I ſhewed how the ſhield of Faith may be vſed.
                     Hitherto of the manner of the Apoſtles exhortation.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 80. Of the meaning of the Metaphor.
                     THe motiue whereby hee inforceth his exhortation,8. Point. The benefit and power of Faith. followeth: wherein is contained the eight generall point to be deliuered in this Treatiſe of Faith, which is
the benefit and power of Faith, in theſe words;
                     
                        Wherewith yee ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the Diuell.
                     
                     THe Apoſtle here vſeth another Metaphor. His manner of phraſe may at firſt ſight ſeeme to bee improper,
That a man ſhould take a ſhield to quench fire: A ſhield is rather to keepe off a blow. But if we well note the drift of the Apoſtle, and alſo the manner of framing his ſpeech, wee may find that it is not ſo improper as it is taken to be. For firſt, he ſaith not, By the ſhield ye quench; but

                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        by it ye ſhall be able to quench. Againe, he ſaith not ſimply,
whereby ye ſhall be able to quench darts, that had beene improper, but he addeth fiery. Thus becauſe Satans temptations are as darts, and as fiery darts, he vſeth the metaphor of a ſhield, in oppoſition to the one, and the metaphor of
quenching in oppoſition to the other. Thus wee ſee that the Apoſtles ſpeech is proper enough, anſwearing two metaphors in their ſeuerall kindes: A ſhield in relation to
d
                              •
                           rts: quenching in relation to fiery.
                     
                     Beſides,A double benefit of Faith. hereby hee declareth a double benefit of Faith: one to protect vs from Satans temptations, that they annoy vs not: the other, (if they doe pierce and wound our ſoules,) to cure the hurt which they haue done.
                     To amplifie this benefit of Faith, the Apoſtle deſcribeth our enemy by his malicious and miſchieuous nature (the wicked) (or,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . as the originall with an emphaſis ſetteth it downe, that wicked one) and his temptations, by the kind of them vnder this metaphor Darts.
                     
                     Of the nature of this wicked one, I haue ſpoken before on verſe 12.
                     For the metaphor, a Dart is a kinde of weapon that is flung, ſlung, or ſhot at a man farre off, which if it hit him, will deepely pierce him, and ſorely gall him. I ſhewed before how we were oft forced to wreſtle with Satan, and to grapple with him hand to hand. Here is ſhewed that he hath alſo Darts to ſhoote at vs a▪ farre off, ſo as hee can pierce and wound vs when wee ſee him not: he can ſend at vs, though he come not to vs. As whenReu. 12. 15. the Dragon could not come at the Woman, he caſt waters after her. This Woman is the Church; the red Dragon, Satan; Waters, his manifold temptations or darts.
                     
                     Thus we ſee that
                     
                        The Diuell can euery way annoy vs,
                        
                           Obſer. Satan can euery way annoy vs. both at hand and afarre off: when he is ſuffered to come to vs, and when he is reſtrained and kept from vs.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         How can wee now at any time be ſecure?
 Doth it not ſtand vs in hand to watch alwaies, alwaies to bee well armed, and haue this ſhield of Faith?
                     That the benefit and power of Faith may be the better diſcerned, I will ſhew more diſtinctly,

                           1 What theſe Darts are.
                           2 How they are kept off.

                     §. 81. Of Satans Darts here meant.
                     SOme take afflictions to be meant by Darts.What are Satans darts.
                     
                     
                        Anſwer. There is another proper peece of armo
                           •

                     Other take all ſinnes and all prouocations to ſinne, to be heere meant.
                     
                        Anſw. This muſt needs be too generall: for thus ſhould the ſeuerall peeces of Armour, and their diſtinct vſes be confounded. The Breſt-plate of Righteouſneſſe is the proper fence againſt ſuch temptations.
                     I take the Darts here ſpoken of to be thoſe ſeueral and ſundry temptations which the Diuell vſeth to draw vs to doubt of that helpe wee haue in GOD,Diabolus in varias deſper ationis cogitationes nos immittit, quo excludat in Deum expectationem. Chryſ. paren. ad Theod. and to deſpaire: for oft he caſteth ſundry thoughts of deſpaire into vs, that he might ſhut out all hope in God, and ſo draw into perdition. Thus afflictions, ſo farre forth as the Diuell vſeth them as meanes to diſquiet and vexe the ſoule, may be here vnderſtood: and likewiſe all ſinnes and prouocations to ſinne, as they tend hereunto. Theſe temptations were they light and faſten, pierce deepe. Satan let ſtore of theſe flie againſt Iob, they fell on him as thicke as haile-ſtones: deſpaire was it which Satan ſought to bring Iob vnto by depriuing him of his cattell, goods, children, &amp; all that he had: by ſtriking his body all ouer with ſore botches &amp; boiles. The contradicting ſpeeches of Iobs wife and friends (the inſtruments of Satan herein) tended to this. Theſe darts alſo he let flie at Dauid, as appeareth by the many complaints of Dauid: yea, he flung ſome of theſe at Chriſt in theMat 4. 3. wilderneſſe, in the&amp; 26. 37, &amp;c garden, and on the&amp; 27. 46. croſſe. No darts ſo wound the body, as theſe wound the ſoule where they faſten.
                  
                  
                     §. 82. Of the vertue of Faith againſt Satans Darts.
                     2 THeſe darts are onely kept off by Faith:
                        Faith onely keepeth off the darts of Satan. for Faith alone giueth vs aſſurance of Gods loue: by it wee ſo reſt and repoſe our ſelues on the fauour of God in Chriſt, as nothing can make vs doubt of it, or ſeparate vs from it.Iob 13. 15.

The ſtronger our Faith is, the better are we fenced againſt theſe temptations: the weaker our Faith is, the deeper doe they pierce: yea if they preuaile againſt vs, it is becauſe we want this ſhield, or at leaſt haue let it fall, and ſo for the time want the vſe of it.

                     §. 83. Of Satans fiery darts.
                     3 THey who by theſe Darts vnderſtand afflictions,What are Satans fiery darts. ſay, they are called fierie, becauſe afflictions are greeuous to the fleſh; they who vnderſtand ſins, becauſe as fire they kindle one another and ſo increaſe.
                     
                        Anſw. But there is an higher matter here meant; for the metaphor is taken from malicious miſchieuous enemies who poiſon the heads of darts, and arrowes, &amp; bullets which they ſhoot at men: theſe poiſoned things being of a fiery nature, if they pierce into a mans fleſh, lie burning, and tormenting the body, and continue to inflame it more and more, till they haue ſoaked out the very life of a man, if in time they be not cured. Thus the forenamed temptations of Satan, tending to doubt and deſpaire, (if they faſten) vexe, grieue and torment the ſoule, burning and feſtring therein, till they bring a man to vtter deſtruction, if the fire and heat of them bee not ſlaked and taken away. It muſt needs bee great burning, great anguiſh and vexation that made Dauid cry out and ſay,Pſal. 6. 1, 3, 6

                        Iudas was ſo tormented therby, that his life was an vnſupportable burden vnto him, he could not endure it, but made away himſelfe, as many other haue done in all ages.

                     4 THe onely meanes to coole this ſcorching heare,By Faith onely the fiery darts of Satan are quenched. &amp; to aſſwage this burning, is the blood of Chriſt: and Faith onely is the meanes to apply the efficacy of Chriſts blood to our ſoules: by Faith therefore, and by nothing elſe, may theſe fiery Darts be quenched. As balſom, &amp; ſuch other medicinable oyles which Chirurgiōs haue for that purpoſe, being applied to that part of mans body which is in flamed with the forenamed poiſonous weapons, aſſwage the heate, driue out the poiſon, and cure the fleſh: ſo Faith, which applieth the vertue of Chriſts Sacrifice to a perplexed and troubled ſoule, diſpelleth the inward anguiſh thereof, pacifieth and quieteth it, and ſo cureth the wounds thereof. The Faith of
Dauid did thus cheere vp and refreſh his ſoule after it had been perplexed; in which reſpect he ſaith vnto his ſoule,

Let vs not dare to yeeld vnto it; but though God ſhould ſeeme to be ſo angry with vs as to kill vs, yet with Iob, to truſt in him.

                           Vſe 2. Wretched are they who want Faith. who are deſtitute of Faith! they lie open to all the fiery, burning, tormenting temptations of the diuell; they haue no meanes to preuent them, none to quench them when they are wounded in conſcience. This fire muſt needs either ſtupifie all their ſpirituall ſences, dry vp all the life of the ſoule, and take away all feeling: or elſe torment them intollerably without all hope of redreſſe, as Caine, Saul, Iudas, and ſuch like were tormented. It were much better for a man not to bee, then not to beleeue.

The maine and principall ende, for which the Apoſtle here ſetteth downe theſe benefits of Faith, that which eſpecially he aymeth at, is, to commend vnto vs this precious gift, ſo as it may be a ſtrong motiue to vrge all the forenamed points concerning Faith, whereof wee haue ſpoken before, and to ſtirre vs vp diligently to labour and vſe all the meanes we can, Firſt to know what true Faith is, Secondly, to get it, Thirdly, to proue it, Fourthly, to preſerue and increaſe it, Fiftly, well and wiſely to vſe it.

Spirituall wounds may be cured. euen to ſuch as are weake, and by reaſon of their weakeneſſe, or elſe through the violence of ſome temptation, haue let fall their ſhield, ſo as Satans fiery Darts haue touched their conſcience, and pierced their ſoule. Let them not thereupon vtterly deſpaire, and yeeld thēſelues ouer to Satans power, but know that yet their Faith may ſtand them in ſteed, that yet there is a further vſe of it, not onely as a ſhield to keepe off, but as balſome to drawe out the fire, to quench it, and cure the wound.

Let not therefore our faintings, failings, and ſpirituall wounds put vs out of all hope, as if death and deſtruction, without all remedy and recouery, muſt needes follow thereupon: But rather let vs with all ſpeed haue recourſe to Gods promiſes, and to Chriſt Ieſus the true heire of them, and ſo renew our Faith, asLuk. 22. 61. 
                        Peter renewed his, when he looked vpon Chriſt.
                  
                  
                     §. 87. Of Satans aſſaulting our Faith.
                     THe laſt point yet remaineth,IX. Point. Satans wyles againſt Faith. which is, to diſcouer the manifold wiles which the Diuell vſeth againſt this heauenly gift, and to ſhew how they may bee auoyded. We haue heard before how he laboureth to ſpoile vs of the Girdle of Truth,Satan moſt of all aſſaulteth our faith. Breſtplate of Righteouſneſſe, and Shooes of Patience; but his beſt wit and greateſt force is bent againſt the Shield of Faith. The firſt aſſault made againſt Eue, was in regard of her Faith,Gen. 3. 1. 
                        Hath God indeede ſaid, &amp;c: ſo againſt Chriſt, (Mat. 4▪ 3. 
                        If thou bee the Sonne of God, &amp;c.) Herein did he oft tempt thePſal. 78. 22. 31. Iſraelites, yea &amp; Moſes
                        Num. 20. 12 alſo in the wilderneſſe.Luk. 22. 32. This was it for which he deſired to winnow Peter; and for whichTheſſ. 3. 5. 
                        Paul feared leſt hee had tempted the Theſſalonians. Lamentable experience ſheweth how mightily hee preuaileth by this temptation: in time of perſecution he bringeth men hereby to renounce their profeſſion: and hereby at all times he bringeth many to the very pit of deſpaire.
                     That which hath been before deliuered concerning the excellency,Reaſon. neceſſity, vſe and benefit of Faith, declareth the reaſon, why the Diuell ſo aſſaulteth it: for hee, being our Aduerſary walking about, and ſeeking whom to deuoure, eſpieth that Faith is it which eſpecially preſerueth vs ſafe from being deuoured; that this is the victory which ouercommeth both1 Pet. 5. 9. himſelfe and his chiefe agent and inſtrument the1 Ioh. 5. 4. world; and therefore with all might and maine endeauoureth to ſpoile vs of this ſhield. It is therefore needfull we ſhould know what are his wyles, and how they may be auoyded.
                     His ſundry kindes of wyles may be drawne to two heads, namely thoſe wherby he laboureth either to keep men from Faith, or elſe to wreſt Faith from them. I will in order diſcouer ſome of the principall in both kinds, which are theſe.
                  
                  
                     §. 88. Anſwer to Satans Suggeſtion, that it is preſumption to beleeue.
                     1. Suggeſt. FIrſt, it is altogether impoſſible to attaine vnto any ſuch gift as Faith is. Secondly, can any man be aſſured that Chriſt is his? Thirdly, whoſoeuer hath any ſuch conceit, preſumeth. Fourthly, to inforce this temptation the further, he alſo ſuggeſteth, that the ground of Faith (Gods word) is vncertaine. And fiftly, though that Scripture were the certain Word of God, yet the Miniſtery of it by man, is too weake a meanes to worke ſo great a worke as Faith is thought to be this Suggeſtion hath preuailed much with Papiſts.
                     
                        Anſw. Firſt, that which hath been before deliuered concerning the getting of Faith, ſheweth that this is a lying Suggeſtion. Secondly, it hath been expreſly proued that a man may know he hath Faith. Thirdly, the differences betwixt Faith and preſumption ſhew, that aſſurance of Faith is no preſumption.
                     1 Faith driueth a man out of himſelfe:Differences betwixt faith and preſumption. becauſe the beleeuer can find no ground of confidence in himſelfe, therefore hee caſteth himſelfe wholly vpon CHRIST.
                     
                        Preſumption findeth ſomething in the man himſelfe to make him boaſt.
                     2 Faith reſteth on a ſure ground, which is Gods Word, that both commandeth vs to beleeue, and promiſeth to performe that which we doe beleeue.
                     
                        Preſumption relyeth onely on a mans ſurmize and meere coniecture.
                     3 Faith is ioyned with the vſe of the means: both of thoſe meanes whereby it was firſt bred, and alſo of thoſe which God hath appointed for the nouriſhing of it.
                     
                        Preſumption not onely careleſly neglecteth, but arrogantly contemneth all meanes.
                     4 Faith is wrought by degrees: firſt by knowledge, then by griefe, after by deſire, as we heard§. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24▪ &amp; §. 41, 42, 43, 44, 44. before.
                     
                        Preſumption is a ſudden apprehenſion of the mind.
                     5 Faith maketh a man worke out his ſaluation with an holy iealouſie, yea with feare and trembling: oft calling vpon God, and depending on him.
                     
                        Preſumption is ouer-bold.
                     6 Faith maketh a man depart from all iniquity, and keepe a cleere conſcience.
                     
                        Preſumption is accompanied with much pollution, at leaſt inward.
                     7 Faith is moſt ſure in time of tryall, then is the ſtrength of it moſt manifeſted.
                     
                        Preſumption like a Bragadocha then maketh greateſt floriſh when there is leaſt danger.
                     8 Faith continueth vnto the end, and neuer falleth away.
                     
                        Preſumption is ſubiect to decay totally and finally.
                     4 Of the certainty of Gods word we ſhal after ſpeak:
                     5 For mans Miniſtery it is Gods ordinance; &amp; thence it hath that mighty power to worke Faith: for God who at firſt brought light out of darkeneſſe, can by weake meanes worke great matters: Beſides,2 Cor. 4. 7 
                        We haue this treaſure in earthly veſſels, that the excellency of that power might be of God, and not of vs.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 89. Anſwer to Satans ſuggeſtion of the difficulty of getting Faith.
                     2 Suggeſt. IF it be not impoſſible to get Faith, yet it is ſo difficult and hard a matter, that not one of a thouſand who ſeeke it, obtaine it. Herein Satan preuaileth with idle, ſlothfull perſons,Pro. 22. 13 &amp; 26. 13. who in all things which they ſhould enterpriſe, pretend more dangers and difficulties then needes, of purpoſe to find a pretence to their idleneſſe.
                     
                        Anſwer. Though it bee hard to the carnall careleſſe man,Faith not hard to the willing. yet (as Salomon ſaith of knowledge, Pro. 14. 6.) Faith is eaſie to him that will beleeue; not that it is ſimply in mans power, but that Gods Spirit ſo openeth his vnderſtanding in the myſteries of godlineſſe, ſo worketh on his hard and ſtony heart, making the one capable, and the other pliable, as thereby the man is brought like ſoftened waxe eaſily to receiue the impreſſion of Gods ſeale. Though man in himſelfe be dead in ſin, yet Gods word is as powerfull to quicken him, as Chriſts was to raiſe Lazarus. Indeed many ſeeke, and find not, aske, and haue not: but why?Iam. 4. 3 Saint Iames giueth one reaſon, They aske, and ſeeke amiſſe. They ſeeke Faith in themſelues, and from themſelues: they ſeeke it by carnall and fleſhly deuices: they ſeeke it by their owne wit and reaſon. Saint Paul rendreth another reaſon,2 Cor. 4. 4. 
                        The God of this world hath blinded their minds, that the glorious light of the Goſpell ſhould not ſhine vnto them. Becauſe they oppoſe againſt Gods truth ſo farre as it is made knowne vnto them, or wittingly winke at it, or turne from it, God giueth them ouer in iuſt iudgement to the power of Satan, who blindeth their minds. But if we repaire to the Author who giueth Faith, and to the ſpring whence it floweth; if we rightly vſe the right meanes of attaining it, and waite at the doore of Wiſedome till ſhee open vnto vs, vndoubtedly we ſhall find Faith and not miſſe of it.
                  
                  
                     §. 90. Anſwer to Satans ſuggeſtion of the ſmall need and vſe of Faith.
                     3 Suggeſt. FAith is a needleſſe thing. This conceit the Diuell putteth into the mind of two ſorts of people: firſt of proud Phariſaicall Iuſticiaries, who truſt to their owne righteouſneſſe: theſe thinke that the breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe is armour enough: Secondly, of ſecure, carnall Goſpellers, who imagine that a good hope (as they call it) is ſufficient, there needeth not aſſurance of Faith.
                     
                        Anſwer. God maketh and ordaineth nothing in vaine: as for the proud Iuſticiary,Great neede of Faith. let him firſt know, that righteouſnes ſeuered from Faith, is no righteouſneſſe: though righteouſneſſe ioyned with Faith be of good vſe, yet ſeuered from Faith, it is of no vſe at all. Secondly, that the Breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe, which the beſt men euer in this World had, was full of crackes and holes, full of many defects and imperfections, through which Satan would ſoone haue wounded them euen to death, if they had not had this ſhield.
                     As for the ſecure Proteſtant, if euer hee feele the fire of Satans darts, he will find that all the aſſurance which poſſibly he can attaine vnto, is little enough. That poore man which ſaid;Mar. 9. 24. 
                        I beleeue, Lord helpe my vnbeliefe: And the Diſciples which ſaid,Luke 17. 5. 
                        Lord increaſe our faith, ſaw that a good hope was not enough.
                     As a preſeruatiue againſt this poyſonous temptation, wee muſt labour for all the aſſurance of Faith that wee can.
                  
                  
                     §. 90. Anſwer to Satans ſuggeſtion of the damage ariſing from Faith.
                     4 Suggeſt. FAith is hurtfull to a mans credit, honour, profit, pleaſure, &amp;c. Herein Satan preuaileth with worldlings, whoſe hearts are onely on things here below.
                     
                        Anſwer. Firſt, the price of Faith,Great is the worth of Faith. yea of one graine of Faith, is of more worth then all the treaſure in the world: this that goodMat. 13. 44. Merchant well knew, who ſold all to buy it.
                     Secondly, they who are wounded with Satans fiery darts, would willingly forgoe all credit, wealth, and pleaſure that the World poſſibly can giue, for a dramme of Faith.
                     Thirdly there can be no true credit, honour, &amp;c. without Faith: all are ſanctified by Faith, otherwiſe they are meere ſhadowes and ſhewes.

                     5 Suggeſt. FAith is too good and precious a thing for poore wretched ſinners to haue: herein hee preuaileth with diſtreſſed fearefull Chriſtians.
                     
                        Anſwer.
                        Mans vnworthineſſe no hinderance of Faith. For remouing of this, wee muſt remember what was§. 28. 29. before deliuered of Gods free grace, and rich bounty, which is not reſtrained by our vn worthineſſe.
                     If the Diuell by theſe, or ſuch like meanes cannot keepe vs from getting faith, he hath other wiles to wreſt it from vs, which follow.
                  
                  
                     §. 92. Anſwer to Satans ſuggeſtion of mans imperfection.
                     6 Suggeſt. THy Faith is not ſound, but counterfeit: for it is mixed with many imperfections, tranſgreſſions, weakeneſſes, doubtings; there is no growth or increaſe of it: many weake Chriſtians are brought hereby to ſtagger.
                     
                        Anſwer.
                        Imperfect Faith may be true &amp; ſound. Oft proue thy Faith, eſpecially by the cauſes, and by thy loue, andHeb. 13. 18. true deſire to liue honeſtly: Know that euery thing here is imperfect, yet that truth and imperfection may ſtand together: ſtriue againſt theſe imperfections, and vſe the meanes for encreaſe of Faith.

Is it not good to ſeeke to the Phyſician in ſickneſſe? to truſt vnto number and proweſſe of men in warre? and to friends in time of need? Thus he maketh many to caſt away the ſhield of Faith, their confidence in God, and to truſt vnto outward meanes, as2 Ch

                     We muſt therefore be like ſound Oaken Trees, which the more they are ſhaken, the deeper roote they get in the earth; and know for our comfort, the Diuel can raiſe no greater ſtormes then God in wiſedome permitteth him.Virtus fidei inper

                  The Helmet of Hope.

                     §. 1. Of the difficulty of a Chriſtian Souldiers Eſtate.
                     
                        EXcellent meanes of defence are thoſe whereof we haue heard, eſpecially the laſt of them: yet the Apoſtle thinketh them not ſufficient, but proceedeth to ſet forth other peeces of armour, ſaying,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            
                           Obſeru. from the inference. No eaſie matter to bee a Chriſtian Souldier. 
                        And take, &amp;c. Whence wee may well gather, that
                     
                        It is no eaſie matter to be a Chriſtian Souldier, and ſtedfaſtly to ſtand vnto the end againſt all aſſaults. Many graces are needfull to be added one to another for that purpoſe. One might haue though that when hee had named the ſhield of Faith, he need haue added no more: but God who knoweth both our weakeneſſe and proneneſſe to faint, and alſo the power and ſubtilty of our aduerſaries better then our ſelues, ſeeth it needfull that an helmet be vſed as well as a ſhield: our care therefore muſt be to vſe this alſo.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 2. Of the Spirituall Grace here meant.
                     THis fift peace of Spirituall Armour (though it bee not plainely expreſſed)Some referre theſe two metaphors, Helmet, Sword, vnto the Word of God, and ſay that two vſes of the word are ſet downe vnder two metaphors: one to be defenſiue as an Helmet: the other to be offenſiue as a ſword.
                         is neceſſarily implied to be Hope;
                        Hope the fifth pe
                              •
                           ce of armour. for1 Theſ. 5. 3. in another place where hee vſeth this metaphor,
                           Anſwer. The ſword alone of it ſelfe implieth both theſe vſes, for it is an eſpeciall meanes of defence as well as of offence: theſe two metaphors being as diſtinctly ſet downe as any of the former, there is no reaſon why they ſhould be referred to one and the ſame thing. hee expreſſeth
Hope, Put on (ſaith he) for an Helmet the hope of Saluation. What could more plainely be ſpoken? and what better interpreter of the Apoſtles minde could wee haue then the Apoſtle himſelfe?Other ſay that Chriſt himſelfe is here meant by this metaphor Helmet, becauſe he is Saluation, and becauſe the very word here vſed (
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           ) is in other places attributed to Chriſt, as Luke 2. 30. &amp; 3. 6.
                     
                     Saluation is thus applied to Hope, becauſe
                     1 Saluation is the maine end of our Hope,Why it is called the hope of ſaluation. that which aboue all toher things wee waite for:
                           Anſwer. It is not properly attributed to Chriſt, but tropically, becauſe he is the Author and finiſher of our ſaluation. It is more proper to take it for the thing it ſelfe which Chriſt hath purchaſed, eternall life.
                         when we come to the poſſeſſion of it, then hath Hope her end, and period.
                     2 It is an eſpeciall meanes of attaining vnto Saluation,2 Thogh Chriſt be here meant by this word Saluation, yet cannot Chriſt with any fit congruity be compriſed vnder this metaphor Helmet: for if we reade the words plainely, Take the Helmet of Chriſt, what elſe can be meant but the helmet which Chriſt vſed, or which he giueth or preſcribeth to vs, as the Armour of God? Thus it will be the ſame thing which we meane, namely, Hope: for as Chriſt is the author and finiſher of our Faith, ſo alſo of our Hope. (Rom. 8. 24. 
                        We are ſaued by Hope.) This is that coard whereby wee hold faſt to Gods promiſes till they bee all accompliſhed, which will not bee vntill wee enioy ſaluation.
                     
                         3 Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt the hope of worldlings, and Saints: their hope reacheth no further then to the things of this life; thereforePro. 11. 7. when they die their hope periſheth, but theſe1 Pet. 1. 3, 4. hope for an inheritance immortall, &amp;c. ThereforePro. 14. 32. they haue hope in their death: for1 Cor. 15. 19 
                        if in this life onely wee haue hope in Chriſt, wee are of all men the moſt miſerable.
                     
                     Thus hauing ſhewed what this Helmet of Saluation is, I will diſtinctly ſhew, 1. What Hope is. 2 How it differeth from Faith. 3 How fitly it is compared to an Helmet. 4 How neceſſary it is. 5 How it is gotten, preſerued, and vſed. 6 What are Satans wiles againſt it.
                  
                  
                     §. 3. Of the definition of Hope.
                     HOpe is an expectation of ſuch good things to come,1. Point. What hope is. as God hath promiſed, and Faith beleeued.
                     1 In expectation eſpecially conſiſteth the very nature of Hope;
                        Rom. 8. 25. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        If we hope, &amp;c.
                        Pſal. 37. 7. 
                        We waite. Dauid ioyneth hoping and waiting together, as implying one and the ſame thing;Pſal. 37. 7. 
                        Waite vpon the Lord, and hope in him.
                     
                     2 Good things are the proper obiect of Hope:
                        Spes non niſi bonarum rerum eſt, nec niſi faturarum. Aug. Enchir. cap. 8. herein it differeth from Feare: We feare things euill and hurtfull.
I looked, that is, hoped for good (ſaith Iob:) The thing (namely) that euill thing which I feared, is come vpon me? Iob 3. 25 &amp; 30. 26.)
                     3 Theſe good things are to come: not paſt, nor preſent, which either are or haue beene ſeene:Rom. 8. 24. 
                        Hope which is ſeene, is no hope: for how can a man hope for that which he ſeeth?
                     
                     4 They are alſo ſuch as God hath promiſed. For the ground of our Hope is the promiſe of God, who is faithfull and true: we may well waite for that which he hath promiſed, whatſoeuer it be. In this reſpect this true Hope is termedCol. 1. 23. 
                        The Hope of the Goſpel: that is, an Hope which waiteth for thoſe things which in the Goſpel are promiſed.
Luke 3. 26. This was the ground of Simeons Hope. Theſe promiſes are of all needfull things in this world, both Spirituall and Temporall; of aſſiſtance vnder all croſſes, and of deliuerance from them: and at length of eternall glory and happineſſe in heauen, which (becauſe it is furtheſt off, and includeth in it an accompliſhment of all other promiſes,) is the moſt proper obiect of Hope. In which reſpect the Scripture doth thus entitle it,1 Theſ. 5. 8. 
                        Hope of Saluation,
                        Tit. 3. 7. 
                        Hope of eternall life,
                        Rom. 5. 2. 
                        Hope of glory, &amp;c.
                     
                     5 The things we hope for, are alſo ſuch as Faith beleeued. For there is ſuch a relation betwixt Faith and Hope, as is betwixt a mother and a daughter: Faith is the mother that bringeth forth Hope; and Hope is a bleſſed daughter which nouriſheth Faith.Heb. 11. 1. 
                        Faith is the ground of things hoped for. Till a thing be beleeued, a man will neuer hope for it:Gal. 5. 5. 
                        By Faith we waite: that is, Faith cauſeth vs to waite. Againe, except a man hope, and waite for that which he beleeueth, his Faith will ſoone decay.
                  
                  
                     §. 4. Of aſſurance and patience of Hope.
                     THus in generall we ſee what Hope is.Two properties of Hope. There are two eſpeciall properties which the Scripture doth oft annexe to Hope,
                        
                           1 Aſſurance.
                           2 Patience.
                        
                     
                     For Aſſurance, expreſly ſaith the Apoſtle,1 Aſſurance.
                        Heb. 6. 11. 
                        Shew diligence to the full Aſſurance of Hope. In regard of this property it is ſaid,Rom. 5. 5. 
                        Hope maketh not aſhamed, that is, diſappointeth not him that hopeth, of the thing which he waiteth for, ſo as he need not be aſhamed of his Hope. Fitly therefore is it termed,Heb. 6. 19. 
                        An Anchor of the ſoule, both ſure and ſtedfaſt. According to the quality and quantity of Faith, is the quality and quantity of Hope. What a man beleeueth, that he hopeth for: as he beleeueth, ſo he hopeth for it: but true Faith doth aſſuredly beleeue the truth of Gods promiſes: therefore true Hope doth certainely expect them, for there are the ſame props to vphold our Hope, as are for our Faith, to wit, the goodneſſe, power, truth, and other like attributes of God: Hope ariſeth not from mans promiſes, nor is nouriſhed by mans merits.
                     Our aduerſaries make vncertainty a property of Hope,
                        Vncertainty no property of Hope. and ground it vpon coniectures and probabilities: wherby they take away one main difference betwixt the hope of ſound Chriſtians, and carnall Libertines: and cleane ouerthrow the nature of ſauing Hope: for though, by reaſon of the fleſh, the beſt may ſometimes wauer in their Hope, as well as in their Faith: yet is not this wauering of the nature of Hope, but the more Hope encreaſeth, the more is doubting diſpelled.
                     For Patience,
                        1 Theſ. 1. 3. 
                              •
                            Rom. 8. 25. that alſo is expreſly attributed to Hope: If we hope for that we ſee not, we doe with patience waite for it: How needfull it is that our Hope bee accompanied with patience, we ſhall ſee hereafter.
                  
                  
                     §. 5. Of the agreement betwixt Faith and Hope.
                     HOpe agreeth with Faith in many things:II. Point. Wherin Hope and Faith agree. for example in theſe.
                     
                         
                        1 In the Author.In the Author and worker of them both, which is Gods holy Spirit, asGal. 5. 22. 
                        Faith is a fruit of the Spirit, ſoRom. 15. 13. 
                        we abound in Hope thorow the power of the holy Ghoſt.
                     
                     
                         
                        2 In the matter.In the common matter, for both are ſauing and ſanctifying graces, asEph. 2. 8. 
                        We are ſaued by Faith,
                        Rom. 8. 25. ſo alſo by Hope:
                         and asAct. 15. 9. 
                        By Faith the heart is purified, ſo1 Ioh. 3. 3. 
                        he that hath Hope purgeth himſelfe.
                     
                     
                         
                        3 In the ground.In the Ground of them, both of them are grounded on Gods promiſes as we haue heard.
                     
                         
                        4 In the properties.In the fore-named properties Aſſurance and Patience. The ſame Apoſtle that made mention ofHeb. 6. 11.

                     §. 6. Of the difference betwixt Faith and Hope.
                     THey differ in theſe things eſpecially.Wherein they differ.
                     
                     1 In their order: Faith is firſt, for it bringeth forth Hope:Heb. 11. 1. 
                        Faith is the ground of things hoped for.
                     
                     2 In the kind of Obiect: Faith is alſo of thingsHeb. 11. 3. paſt, andIoh. 20. 29. preſent: hope onely of things to come.
                     
                        Obiect. Faith is alſo of things to come: for we beleeue eternall life.
                     
                        Anſw. Faith giueth
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Heb. 11. 1. a ſubſiſtence, and preſent being, to ſuch things as are to come; by it we beleeue thoſe good things which are promiſed to be ours, though the poſſeſſion of them be to come.
                     3 In their nature: Faith beleeueth the very truth of Gods promiſes, andIoh. 3. 33. 
                        ſealeth that God is true: Hope waiteth till God manifeſt and accompliſh his truth.
                     Thus we ſee that Hope is a different and diſtinct grace frō 
                        Faith: yea ſo, as it may be of vſe when faith faileth: and it ſerueth to cheriſh and vphold Faith: needfull it is therfore that vnto Faith it be added.
                  
                  
                     §. 7. Of the reſemblance betwixt Hope and an Helmet.
                     FItly is Hope reſembled to an Helmet,
                        III. Point. How fitly Hope is reſembled to an Helmet. which, according to the notation of the
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Greeke word, couereth the head all ouer, ſo as vnder it may be compriſed the Beuer, and whatſoeuer couereth the face. The vſe of this Helmet is to keep and fence the head ſafe from Arrowes, Darts, Bullets, Swords and other weapons, whereby it might otherwiſe be ſorely wounded, and the man be killed downe-right.
                     He that hath his head and face well and ſafely couered, will be bold and couragious without feare, lifting vp his head, and looking his enemy in the face, and ſo boldly goe on forward, not fearing Arrowes, Darts, or any ſuch things that ſhall be ſhot, or throwne at him. Euen ſo he whoſe ſoule is eſtabliſhed with Hope, waiting for Saluation in the end, will with an holy reſolution goe on in his courſe to God, not fearing the manifold aſſaults of his ſpirituall enemies, being aſſured that they ſhall not pierce his ſoule, but that at length he ſhall remaine a Victorer, when the Diuell and his inſtruments haue ſhot all their Arrowes againſt him. Hope of Saluation maketh a man rouſe vp his ſoule and ſpirit in the midſt of temptations: thus much the notation of that

                        from whence my helpe commeth.
                     
                     Out of all that hath beene ſaid, may eaſily be gathered what is the vſe of hope, and how needfull and profitable a peece of Armour it is.
                  
                  
                     §. 8. Of the vſe of Hope.
                     THe vſe of it is to keepe vs from fainting, that we be not confounded through any aſſaults of our enemies: forRom. 5. 5: 
                        Hope maketh not aſhamed, but maketh bold and confident:Pſal. 27. 13. 14. 
                        Dauid implieth that he had fainted, but for his hope, and thereupon exhorteth others to Hope in the Lord. In this reſpect,Heb. 6. 19. the Apoſtle vſeth another metaphor, and reſembleth Hope to an Anchor.
                        Sicut anchora iactata de naui non permittit cam circūferri, licet venticommoueant, ſed firmam facit, ficet ſpes. Chry. in Heb. hom. 11 When Mariners haue a good ſound Anchor faſt tyed to the ſhip with a ſtrong Cable, and faſt fixed on firme ground, they dare ſleepe quietly therein, though ſtormes and tempeſts ariſe: for the Anchor will keepe the ſhip ſafe and ſure, ſo as it cannot be carried away of winds, nor beaten againſt rocks, nor ſwallowed of gulfes. Thus doth Hope after an holy maner make vs ſecure, and that though afflictions and temptations like ſtormes, be raiſed againſt vs.
Pſal. 23. 4. 
                        Though I ſhould walke through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will feare no euill, ſaith Dauid; whereby he manifeſteth his holy ſecurity, which alſo he doth by many other like ſpeeches in his Pſalmes.
                  
                  
                     §. 9. Of the need of Hope, in regard of the vncertaine and long date of Gods promiſes.
                     THis being the vſe of Hope,IIII. Point. Hope neceſſary in foure reſpects. it is very needfull, yea neceſſary, and that in foure reſpects.
                     
                         1 In regard of the time which God hath ſet downe for the accompliſhment of his promiſes,1 Time vncertaine. which time is oft both vnknowne, and long dated, though the time be of God certainly determined, ſo as it cannot be preuented, (Ioh. 7. 30.) nor ſhall be ouerpaſſed, (Hab. 2. 3.) yet
Mar. 13. 32. Act. 1. 7. it is not alwayes made knowne vnto vs. It is therefore needfull that we waite for the time of the accompliſhment of them. Such a collection doth Chriſt himſelfe inferre vpon ſuch a ground:Mar. 13. 33. 
                        Take heede, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. And excellently doth he exemplifie it by theLuke 12. 36, &amp;c. parable of the ſeruants that waited while their Maſter returned from the wedding.
                     In wiſedome alſo it pleaſeth God many times to ſet a long date to the accompliſhment of his promiſes. WhenGen. 12. 7. 
                        Abraham came out of Haran, then God promiſed ſeed vnto him, and a bleſſing vpon his ſeed, yet was
&amp; 21. 5. 
                        Abraham an hundred yeeres old before he had a childe of Sarah: ſo there paſſed at leaſt twenty fiue yeeres betwixt the making and performing of this promiſe, (compare Gen. 12. 4. &amp; 21: 5.) yetRom. 4. 18. 
                        aboue Hope, vnder Hope, did he wait for it.Luk. 2. 25, &amp;c. The promiſe which was made to Simeon was not accompliſhed till he was an old man, ready to die; yet he continued to wait. There paſſed almoſt foure thouſand yeeres betwixt that time.Gen. 3. 15. wherein the bleſſed ſeed of the woman was firſt promiſed, andLuk. 2. 1. &amp;c. wherein he was exhibited. There haue paſſed aboue fiue thouſand yeeres ſinceIude v. 14. the time that the glorious comming of Chriſt vnto iudgement was promiſed, and yet is not accompliſhed, and God knoweth when it ſhall be. The date of many promiſes, are much longer then the Saints thought of: and they are kept longer in ſuſpence then they looked for. In this reſpect there is great need of Hope, yea of patient Hope. Note the anſwer giuen to the ſoules vnder the Altar, which was,Reu. 6. 10. 11 Dei promiſſis credere debemus etiamſi multum temporis interfluat. Chryſ. in Gen. hom. 39. 
                        That they ſhould reſt till their fellow ſeruants, and their brethren that ſhould be killed euen as they were, were fulfilled.
                     
                     The office of Hope, is to make vs waite, and ſtill to waite, and that with patience, though God tarry neuer ſo long, Though it tarry, waite, (Hab. 2. 3.) Dauid waited though his ſoule fainted. (Pſal. 119. 81.)
                  
                  
                     §. 10. Of the need of Hope in regard of troubles.
                     2 IN regard of thoſe many troubles and perplexities which doe fall out betwixt the making and accompliſhing of Gods promiſes,2 Troubles many. we haue a great need of Hope.Exod. 5. 7. After that God had promiſed Canaan to Iſrael, Iſrael was in miſerable bondage before he poſſeſſed Canaan: yea, after God had ſent Moſes to tell them that the promiſed time of their deliuerance was come, they were more cruelly oppreſſed, before they could get out; and when they were got out, what and how many ſtreights were they brought vnto at the red ſea, and in the wilderneſſe before they entred into Canaan? euen ſuch and ſo many, as of all the men which came out of Aegypt, onely two (which patiently waited to the end,) entred into it.
Dauid was promiſed to haue the Kingdome of Iſrael: but how was he perſecuted, and made to fly the Countrey before he was crowned? How oft were the people of God made a prey to their enemies, and ſcorned among the nations before the promiſed Meſsiah was exhibited? What deſolations hath the Church been brought vnto (it hath been like the Moone in the deepeſt waine) and yet Chriſt not come?
                     Thus doth the Lord in wiſdome diſpoſe of his Church while it is here warfaring on earth; as for many other iuſt and weighty reaſons, ſo to try if we can waite, patiently waite, and thatRom. 4. 18. vnder Hope, though it be aboue Hope. In regard of theſe troubles, therefore is Hope very needfull, asHeb. 10. 35. &amp;c. the Apoſtle implieth, who earneſtly exhorteth the Hebrewes, euen in this reſpect to waite. It is the office of Hope, to make vs waite and abide til God remoue the croſſe.
                  
                  
                     §. II. Of the need of Hope in regard of the ſcoffes of the wicked.
                     3 HOpe is needfull in regard of the ſcoffes and reproaches of the wicked:3 Wicked ſcoffe. for if Gods promiſes be not ſpeedily accompliſhed,2 Pet. 3. 4. they are ready to vpbraide Gods children, and ſay, Where are his promiſes? If afflictions befall them,Pſal. 42. 10. 
                        Where is their God? If afflictions be greeuous,
&amp; 3. 2. 
                        There is no helpe for him in God. Is not then Hope neceſſary to vphold vs againſt theſe? Dauid hereby vpheld himſelfe: for when the wicked ſaid, Where is their God, he ſaid to his Soule,
                        &amp; 42. 11. 
                        Waite on God.
                     
                     It is the office of Hope to make vs looke ſo much the more ſtedfaſtly vpon God, and the faſter to cleaue vnto him, by how much the more wicked men doe ſeeke to draw vs from the Lord.
                  
                  
                     §. 12. Of the neede of Hope in regard of our owne weakeneſſe.
                     4 VVE haue need of Hope,4 we weake. in regard of our own weakeneſſe, for we are very prone by nature to thinke that God forgetteth vs, and remembreth not his promiſes made to vs, if at leaſt it be a long time before he accompliſh them; or if he bring vs to any ſtreights, and ſeeme to hide his face from vs. Dauid was herewith ſorely tempted, it made him cry out, and ſay,
Pſal. 13. 1. 
                        How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for euer? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me? But what vpheld him? himſelfe ſheweth that it was his hope▪ For in the ſame Pſalme he ſaith,Pſal. 13. 5. 
                        I truſt in thy mercy.
                     
                     It is the office of Hope in this reſpect, to make vs hope aboue hope, asRom. 4. 8. 
                        Abraham; and againſt ſence, asIob 13. 15. 
                        Iob.
                     
                     Thus we ſee that hope is ſo needfull, as there is no liuing in this world without it: herein is the prouerbe verified,
If it were not for hope the heart would breake.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 13. Of getting and preſeruing Hope.
                     LEt vs therefore in the next place obſerue how it may be,V. Point. How hope is gotten. firſt, gotten, ſecondly, preſerued, thirdly, wel vſed.
                     1 It is gotten by the ſame meanes that faith is: for it is the daughter of Faith.See Treat. 2. part. 6. &amp;. 17. &amp;c. The meanes which beget faith, do immediatly hereupon beget hope.
                     2 It is preſerued by two meanes eſpecially.2. Hovv preſerued.
                     
                     1. By a due conſideration and ful perſwaſion of Gods properties; which make vs patiently abide for the accompliſhment of his promiſes.
                     2 By a faithful remēbrance of Gods former dealings.
                     Foure ſpeciall properties of God are for this purpoſe to be obſerued. 1. His free grace. 2. His infinite power. 3. His infallible truth. 4. His vnſearchable wiſdome.
                     For being in our hearts perſwaded by faith.1. Faith in Gods promiſes vpholdeth hope. Firſt, That the ſame grace which mooued God to make any gracious promiſe, will further mooue him to accompliſh it. And ſecondly, That hee is able to doe it. And thirdly, So faithfull, that not a word which he hath ſaid ſhall fall to the ground: Yea, and fourthly, That he is moſt wiſe in appointing the fitteſt times and ſeaſons for all things, ſo as may moſt make to his owne glory, and his childrens good; we are thus brought to waite, and to continue waiting on God (without preſcribing any time to him) till he hath actually performed what he faithfully promiſed.
                  
                  
                     §. 14. Of Experience nouriſhing Hope.
                     GODS former dealings both with others,2 Experience vpholdeth Hope. and alſo with our ſelues being faithfully remembred, worke ſuch anRom. 5. 4. 
                        experience as cannot but bring forth Hope: For this experience doth euidently demonſtrate what God is willing and able to doe.Pſal. 22. 4. &amp; 34. 6. &amp; 143. 5. Hereby was Dauids Hope much cheriſhed and ſtrengthened.Iam. 5. 11. This meanes doth St 
                        Iames vſe to ſtrengthen the hope of Chriſtian Iewes, bringing to their memories Gods dealing with Iob.
                     
                     For this end, we muſt acquaint our ſelues with the Hiſtories of former times, eſpecially ſuch as are recorded in the holy Scriptures: forRom. 15. 4. 
                        Whatſoeuer things are written afore time (namely in thoſe Scriptures) are written for our learning, that wee thorow patience and comfort of the Scriptures might haue Hope. It is alſo good to be acquainted with other Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories: but eſpecially to obſerue Gods dealings in our owne times.
                     TheRom. 5. 4. 
                        experience which moſt of all bringeth forth Hope, is that which we haue of Gods dealing with our ſelues, whereof we haue two notable examples, one of Iacob, (Ge
                           •
                        . 32. 10.) The other of Dauid, (1 Sam. 17. 37.)
                     For this end we are well to obſerue and remember all thoſe gracious fauours which God from time to time vouchſafeth to vs, and not careleſly let them ſlip at the time preſent, nor negligently forget them in the time paſt. The Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe failed in both theſe:
                        Pſal. 106. 7. 
                        They vnderſtood not Gods wonders, while God was doing them; neither afterwards did they remember the multitude of Gods mercies. This was the cauſe that they could not waite till the time appointed for their entring into Canaan was come: but fainted, and fell in the Wilderneſſe.
                  
                  
                     §. 15. Of meditating on the end of Hope.
                     TO theſe may be added as a further meanes to vphold and cheriſh Hope,Oft meditate of the end of Hope. a ſerious and frequent meditation of the end of our Hope,Si vis ſuſtinere laborem, attende mercedem. Aug. in Pſal. 36 namely, that rich and glorious inheritance which Chriſt hath purchaſed for his Saints, and God hath promiſed vnto them. Much might be ſaide to amplifie this point, but I will referre it to the priuate meditation of the Reader: and let it the rather be meditated of, becauſe we ſee the hopes of worldly men to be ſuſtained with matters which are no way comparable herevnto. Obſerue what their hope is in earthly things, which are very vncertaine:Iam. 5. 7. 
                        The husbandman waiteth for the fruite of the earth, and hath long patience for it, vntill hee receiue the former and the latter raine. As the Husband-man, ſo the Souldier, the Marriner, the Merchant, who not? Their hopes make them vnter much, and ſend themſelues forth to great dangers, &amp; yet oft they faile of their hopes. Shall Chriſtians of all others caſt away their Hope, the end whereof is more excellent then all things in Sea and Land, which alſo they are ſure to receiue, if they faint not?
Heb. 10. 35. 
                        Caſt not away your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 16. Of the reſemblance betwixt Hope and an Anchor.
                     3 THe vſe of hope may fi
                           •
                        ly be ſet forth by that other metaphor whereunto Hope is reſembled,3. How hope is well vſed. namely, an Anchor. (Heb. 6. 19.)
                     1 It muſt be caſt vpon a ſure ground.
                        1 Caſt the anchor of hope on a ſure ground. If an anchor becaſt into a bottomleſſe ſea, where is no ground, or on quick ſands, which are no ſure ground, it is of no vſe, the ſhippe may be toſſed vp and downe, and ſuffer wracke for all that. The onely ſure ground of hope is Gods promiſe reuealed in his Word. That this is a moſt firme ground cannot bee doubted of, vnleſſe the goodneſſe, power and faithfulneſſe of God be called into queſtion. For as God himſelfe is, ſo is his▪ Word, faithfull and true, ſure and certaine: nothing more firme and ſtable:Matth. 5. 18. 
                        Till heauen and earth periſh, one iot or title of Gods word ſhall not ſcape, till all things be fulfilled.
                        Pſal. 119. 19. 
                        Dauid caſt the anchor of his hope vpon this ground. We are therefore to acquaint our ſelues with Gods manifold promiſes.
                     2 It muſt be faſt fixed on that ſure ground.2, Faſt fixe it on that ground. If an anchor onely lie vpon the ground, and be not fixed on it, as good be without ground.
                     Then is hope faſt fixed on Gods promiſe, when his promiſe is ſtedfaſtly beleeued: Faith maketh a way and entrance for hope.Rom. 4. 18, &amp;c. 
                        Abraham firſt beleeued Gods promiſe, and then waited for it.
                     Firſt therfore labour for true and ſound faith in Gods promiſes, then will thy hope be ſure and ſtedfaſt.
                     3 It muſt oft be ſetled and fixed anew.3. Of
                              •
                            renew, the hold. If an Anchor looſe and ſlacken after it hath once been faſtned, a ſtorme may cartie the ſhippe away: where then is the benefit of the former faſtening? Our hope in regard of our owne weakeneſſe, and the violence of Satans manifold ſtormes, is much ſubiect to looſening, to wauering. It muſt therefore oft be renewed:Iſa. 40. 31. 
                        They that waite on the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength. Theſe words may be taken both as a promiſe of God, ſhewing what he will doe; and as a duty on our part, ſhewing what we ought to doe.
                     For this end, againe and againe meditate on thoſe promiſes which we haue once knowne and beleeued, and oft call to minde Gods former benefits and performance of his promiſes: (theſe were Dauids vſuall practiſes.) For theſe being meanes to raiſe vp Hope in vs at firſt, the recalling of them to our mindes againe, muſt needes be meanes to renew our hope.
                  
                  
                     §. 17. Anſwer to Satans ſuggeſtion againſt a ſure ground of Hope.
                     IN the laſt place,VI. Point. Satans wiles. Satan hath many waies to ſpoile vs of this peece of Armour alſo, and that either by labouring to keepe it from vs, that we neuer haue it, or to wreſt it from vs after we haue it.
                     Becauſe there is a mutuall relation betwixt Faith and Hope, ſo as without Faith there can be no Hope, he bends what forces he can againſt Faith to keepe vs from it, or depriue vs of it. To auoide this, the former Treatiſe of Faith is to be obſerued.
                     His Suggeſtions more proper againſt this grace, are ſuch as theſe.
                     
                        Suggeſt. 1 There needeth no ſuch adoe to find out a ſure ground; if thou hope well, it is well enough. Thus he preuaileth with the greater ſort of our people, eſpecially with the more ignorant and ruder ſort, who doe not onely in their hearts conceiue, but with their tongues alſo are ready to vtter ſuch conceits as theſe, I hope well, yea, I hope to be ſaued as well as the beſt. Here is their anchor caſt out. But aske them, what is the ground of their Hope, all the anſwer they can giue, is, They Hope well. Many that know not the fundamental points of Chriſtian Religion, nor the firſt grounds of Saluation, (being much worſe then theHeb. 5. 12. Hebrewes, of whom the Apoſtle complaineth that they had need be taught which are the firſt principles of the Oracles of God) will yet ſay, I hope well.
                     
                     
                        Anſwer. To auoid this, all ignorant perſons, though they be growne in yeeres, muſt be willing to be inſtructed and euen catechiſed.

                     IF thus the Diuell cannot keepe vs from attaining true Hope, then will he labour to quaile our Hope, and ſo ſpoile vs of it, and that by theſe and ſuch like meanes.
                     1 By making vs too careleſſe, and too ſecure, wherein he ſomewhat preuailed with Lot, Dauid, Peter, and ſuch other.
                     For auoiding this, we muſt duly conſider our owne weakeneſſe, and the many fierce temptations whereunto we are ſubiect, and thereby be ſtirred vp to watch and pray, asMat. 26. 41. Chriſt vpon this ground exhorteth his diſciples.
                     2 By mouing vs to deſpaire, by reaſon of our vnworthineſſe: and here he will obiect what we are by nature, what by the multitude and greeuouſneſſe of our actuall tranſgreſſions, and in theſe reſpects how vnworthy of the ſaluation which we waite for.
                     For auoiding this, we muſt remoue our eyes from off our ſelues, and caſt them vpon the free grace, and rich mercy of God, and vpon the all-ſufficient merit of Chriſt, and remember that the ſaluation which God hath promiſed, he will giue for his owne Names ſake.
                     
                         3 By calling into queſtion the truth of Gods promiſes, eſpecially when he ſeemeth long to delay the accompliſhment of them, or when troubles ariſe.
                     For auoyding this, we muſt be perſwaded, that God is wiſeſt, and beſt knoweth the fitteſt times and meanes for accompliſhing his promiſes.

                        THe ſixt and laſt peece of Armour, is not only defenſiue as all the former, but offenſiue alſo, like a Sword.

and he ſhall flie. Reſiſt, is a word not onely of defence, but alſo of offence. This phraſe, he ſhall flie, ſheweth that our endeauour muſt be to driue him away, and put him to flight. It implyeth both a promiſe and a duty. To this purpoſe tend thoſe phraſes in Scripture of

                        beating downe the body, and keeping it in ſubiection. We haue a notable example hereof in our Head and Generall Chriſt,Mat. 4. 10. who put the Diuell to flight: likewiſe in one of his Captaines, S. Paul,
                        1 Cor. 9. 27. who brought his body into ſubiection, &amp;Gal. 6. 14. to who the world was crucified.
                     If we ſtand onely vpon defence, we embolden &amp; hearten our enemies,Reaſon. wh

                         will neuer leaue aſſaulting vs, till they haue preauiled againſt vs, except they be deſtroyed; as Saul neuer left perſecuting Dauid, till he himſelfe was deſtroyed.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 Heere is a good direction for Magiſtrates that haue a charge ouer people committed vnto them,
 that they content not themſelues with defending ſuch as are vnder their gouernment from idolaters,Magiſtrates muſt cut off the enemies of the church heretiques, atheiſts, worldlings, and the like enemies, but that they cut off and deſtroy thoſe dangerous and miſchieuous enemies. For this purpoſe the ſword of God is committed into their hands: andRom. 13. 4. 
                        They are the Miniſters of God, to take vengeance on ſuch as doe euill.
                        2 Kin. 23. 20. Thus did that good King Ioſiah, and other good Kings.
                     
                        Obiect. This is done by the temporall ſword, but what is that to the Sword of the Spirit here meant?
                     
                        Anſw. 1 It may fitly be applyed by way of alluſion.
                     2 It followeth by iuſt and neceſſary conſequence: for euery one muſt doe his beſt to profligate ſpirituall enemies: and ſeeing God hath afforded to Magiſtrates not onely the ſpiritual Sword which is common to all Chriſtians, but alſo a temporall Sword which is proper to thē, they muſt vſe both.
                     3 The vſe of the temporall Sword is a great helpe to the ſpirituall,The vſe of the temporall ſword an help to the ſpirituall. and much good may be done thereby: for howſoeuer Satan himſelfe, being a Spirit, is no whit danted with the temporall Sword: yet idolaters, heretiques, profane men, and other like inſtruments of the diuell, in, and by whom the diuell much annoyeth the Church of God, are danted, and may be deſtroyed thereby, and ſo Satan put to flight. It is the ouerthrow &amp; ruine of many Churches, that the ciuill Gouernours ſuffer the enemies therof to get head, &amp; aſſault the church &amp; people of God.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 Here is a direction alſo for Miniſters.
 They muſt not only teach the truth,2 Miniſters muſt reſute error, and reproue vice. inſtruct in good maners, encourage the vpright, but alſo refute errors, cut downe ſin, and endeauour to deſtroy whatſoeuer maketh againſt the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt. Note what the Apoſtle ſaith in this caſe,2 Cor. 10. 4, 5, 6. 
                        The weapons of our warfare are mighty thorow God to caſt down holds, caſting down the imaginations, &amp; euery high thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of God, &amp;c. and hauing vengeance ready againſt all diſobedience. That we may not thinke that this was proper to his Apoſtolicall function,Tit. 1. 9. he ſaith in generall of a Biſhop, that as he muſt be able to exhort with wholeſome doctrine, ſo to improue them that ſay againſt it. There is a two edged Sword put into the mouths of miniſters, they muſt accordingly vſe it, to defend by teaching ſound doctrine, and inſtructing in good maners: to offend by confuting errors, &amp; reprouing ſins. Many errors in iudgement, and much corruption in life creepeth into the Church for want hereof.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 3 As for priuate perſons euery one hath a charge ouer his own ſoule,
 for their own ſoules ſafety they muſt reſiſt Satan,3 Priuate Chriſtians muſt ſubdue their enemies oppoſe againſt the world, ſubdue their fleſh, ſtrike &amp; fight: it is a fooliſh pitty to ſpare the enemy, &amp; deſtroy a mans ſelfe. If Satan tempt, with an holy indignation, bid him auoid: if the world allure, defie it: if the fleſh luſt, ſub due it.
                     
                         Thus much for the connexion of this Weapon with the former peeces of Armor. I will now diſtinctly handle it, and ſhew
                     1 What this Weapon is.
                     2 How fitly reſembled to a Sword, and why called the Sword of the Spirit.
                     3 How it may be taken and vſed.
                     4 What is the benefit of well vſing it.
                     5 What are the ſleights of Satan to depriue vs of it.
                  
                  
                     §. 2. Of the true Word of God.
                     THe Weapon here preſcribed,1. Point. What is the Word of God is expreſly termed the Word of God, which is that part of Gods will which in the holy Scripture he cauſed to be recorded. It is called

                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        Word, becauſe by it Gods will is manifeſted and made knowen, euen as a man maketh knowne his minde and will by his words.
                     It is alſo ſaid to be the Word of God in regard,
                     1 Of the Author, which is2 Tim. 3. 16. God himſelfe.
                     2 Of the matter, which isEphe. 1. 9. Gods will.
                     3 Of the end, which is Gods&amp; 3. 10. glory.
                     4 Of the efficacy, which is GodsRom. 1. 16. power.
                     This word is properly and truely the right ſence and meaning of the Scripture:Not the letter but the ſence is Gods word. for except that bee found out, in many words there may ſeeme to be matter of falſhood, (as thatMar. 13. 32. the Sonne knoweth not the day of iudgement,) of hereſie (as that the Father is greater then the Son) and contradiction,Ioh. 14. 28. 
                              •
                           
                         as betwixt that which Chriſt ſaid (my Father is greater then I,) and that which the Apoſtle ſaid, (thatPhil. 2. 6. Chriſt Ieſus thought it no robbery to be equall with God.)
                     The letter of Scripture may be alledged, and yet the word of God miſſed, as by all her etiques. And a man may ſwarue from the letter, and yet alledge the true word of God, as the Euangeliſts and Apoſtles did many times.

                     So may diuerſe tranſlaters differ in ſome words and phraſeſ▪ and Preachers in alledging teſtimonies of the Scripture may miſſe of the iuſt letters, and yet all retaine the true word of God, which is the true ſence rightly conceiued, and rightly applyed.

                        ſearch the Scriptures.

Solomon (Pro. 2. 4.) and ſo much the rather becauſe euery ſentence, ſyllable, letter and tittle in holy Scripture is of moment. Otherwiſe if we doe not thus ſearch the Scriptures, inſteed of Gods word wee may alleadge our owne conceits.

                     FOr our helpe in finding out the true ſence of Scripture, there are diuers profitable meanes, as
                     1 Vnderſtanding of the originall tongues:
                        Vide Aug▪ de doct. Chr. l. 3. c. 24, 25. &amp;c. diuerſe errors &amp; hereſies haue been drawn from tranſlations. It is likely that the firſt thing that moued Papiſts to make mariage a Sacrament, was the word Sacramentum which the vulgar tranſlation vſeth Epheſ. 5. 32. and which the Rh

                     Beſides, euery language hath proper kinds of ſpeeches, which being tranſlated word for word, in other languages would ſeeme obſurd: ſo that for the true vnderſtanding of the propriety of many Scripture phraſes, knowledge of the originall tongues is needfull.
                     2 Skill in the Arts, whereby proper and figuratiue phraſes may be diſcerned and diſtinguiſhed, and whereby the true conſtruction of words, and iuſt conſequence of arguments may be obſerued.

Thus may the true meaning of that parable touching the Samaritan,Luk. 10. 30. &amp;c which ſhewed mercy to the man wounded and halfe dead, be eaſily found out.
                     5 Comparing one place with another. Thus the meaning of many types and propheſies in the old Teſtament, may be vnderſtood by the application of them in the New. By comparing obſcure places with perſpicuous places, the obſcure will be made perſpicuous.

                        A Sword,
                        II. Point. How fitly Gods word is compared to a ſword. whereunto the word is compared, hath a double vſe: one to defend a man from the aſſaults of his enemies; (they who can well vſe a ſword, find a great vſe hereof, euen in this reſpect.) The other is to annoy, driue backe, and deſtroy a mans enemy.2 Sam. 23. 10 This double vſe did Eleazar one of Dauids Worthies make of his ſword, (which he vſed ſo long, that it claue to his hand againe,) he defended himſelfe and the Iſraelites, and deſtroyed the Philiſtims therewith.
                     Thus the word of God is of great vſe, both to defend

                     Behold Gods goodneſſe and wiſedome in furniſhing vs with ſuch a weapon as our greateſt enemies, euen they who are not fleſh and blood, do dread: and that not without cauſe, becauſe it is of power to confound them. So as if we be wiſe, skillful and carefull in vſing i

                     For this end the authority of the Scriptures is well to be noted:Quod diuinarum ſcripturarum perſpicua firmatur authoritate ſine vlla dubitatio ne credendum eſt. Aug. ep. 1

                        Dauid vpon his owne experience affirmeth that by Gods Word hee was made wiſer then the Ancient, then his Teachers, then his Enemies. Ancient men who haue much experience of many times, and of many things done in thoſe times, commonly get much wiſedome by their long experience; ſo asIob 11. 12. 
                        among the ancient is wiſedome, and in the length of daies is vnderſtanding. Yet Gods Word taught Dauid to vnderſtand more then experience could teach the ancient. Yea, though Teachers commonly know more then Schollers, or learners, (Mal. 2. 7. 
                        Their lips ſhould preſerue knowledge:) yet Dauid by Gods Word exceeded all his Teachers in knowledge. And though enemies thorow their continall ſearching after ſundry points of pollicy, and inuenting many ſtratagems and cunning wyles, as alſo by prying into the attempts of the aduerſe parties, grow very ſubtill and crafty; yet by this Word of God did Dauid learne more wiſdome then all they. For Gods Word is of a farre larger extent then mans wit, wiſdome, learning, and experience can attaine vnto. Though the Booke wherein Gods Word is contained, be not comparable in multitude of letters, ſillables, and words, to the maſſie Volumes of many mens works; yet for ſubſtance of ſound matter, and variety of ſeuerall and ſundry directions, all the Bookes in the World are not comparable to it. Euery good thing whatſoeuer may be iuſtified thereby: euery euill thing whatſoeuer may be diſproued thereby: ſo as by this Sword euery good thing which is oppoſed againſt may be maintained, and euery euill thing whereunto we are tempted, be repelled. There is no croſſe vnder which any man lieth, no diſtreſſe whervnto any is brought, but may be eaſed, and helped by Gods Word: from it may ſound comfort be fetched, by it may a man be ſupported.Pſal. 119. 50 This was Dauids comfort in his trouble. Art thou afflicted in body, or troubled in conſcience? Are thy Children, kinsfolke, or any other which thou accounteſt neere and deare vnto thee, a vexation vnto thee? Is thy eſtate decayed? Art thou troubled with euill men, or any other way diſtreſſed? Search the Scriptures: therein ſhalt thou find comfort enough, if rightly thou canſt apply them.

Whoſoeuer careleſly neglecteth it, or lightly eſteemeth it, is moſt vngratefull to God, who in wiſedome and goodneſſe hath prouided it for him; and moſt iniurious to himſelfe, in loſing the vſe and benefit of ſuch a weapon.

 are Papiſts?They are enemies of Gods people, who depriue them of the vſe of the Word. who (like the Philiſtims, 1 Sam. 13. 19. 22.) depriue them of this weapon? Herein they plainely declare themſelues to be ſeruants of Antichriſt, and enemies of Chriſt. They doe euen conſpire with Satan himſelfe: and ſo alſo doe all they which openly or couertly ſpeake againſt priuate reading, and publike preaching of the Word; who ſcoffe at that knowledge which lay men and woemen haue in Gods Word.

 or reiect,Who neglect the Word, are enemies to their owne ſoule. or abuſe Gods Word, what enemies are they to their owne ſoules, making way to their owne deſtruction? too many ſo doe, as
                     1 They who care not to reade it,1 Who reade it not, or heare it not at all. or heare it at all: of all Books they leaſt reſpect the Bible. Many will haue Statute Bookes, Chronicles, yea, Play-bookes, and ſuch like toyiſh Pamphlets, but not a Bible in their Houſe or hands: yea, (which is very lamentable) ſome Schollers which intend to be Diuines, haue, and reade ſtore of Poſtils, Legends, and ſuch like traſh, and yet are ſtrangers to the holy Scriptures. Some vſe to carry other Books with them to Church, euen then to draw away their mindes from hearing Gods Word, when it is read and preached by others. Some goe yet further, and will not ſuffer their Wiues, Children, or other of their Houſhold to reade the Word. And ſome ſcoffe at ſuch as carry the Scriptures with them to Church, terming them in reproach, Biblecarriers. All theſe, and all other like theſe, haue no ſword at all.
                     2 They who haue Bibles,2. Who ſeldom reade it. and it may be fairely bound vp: but why? onely to lie in their houſe; or to carry with them to Church: they reade it (if at all) as ſeldome as may be; their wordly affaires will afford them no time to reade the Scripture. How many be there, that neuer in their liues read thorow all the Scriptures, if euer they read thorow any one Booke? Theſe haue a Sword, but to hang by the wals.
                     3 They who reade much;3 Who ſearch it not. but onely reade, neuer ſearch the Scriptures, to find out the true ſence and meaning of it: much like vnto ſuperſticious Papiſts, who content themſelues with mumbling ouer at ſet times a certaine number of prayers ſtinted by their bead, not regarding what they pray. Theſe haue their Sword alwaies in the ſcabbard.
                     4 They who as they reade,4 Who ſeeke not to be edified by it. ſo ſeeke for the true ſence, but to what end? onely to vnderſtand the truth of the Hiſtory, to reconcile ſeeming differences, to maintaine diſcourſe, or it may be alſo to iuſtifie the truth of doctrine againſt gaine-ſayers: but not to be edified in Faith, and to haue ſinne mortified thereby. Theſe draw forth this ſword onely to flouriſh with it.
                     5 They who in ſearching out the ſence of Scripture,5. Who neglect the preaching of it. truſt to their owne skill, wit and vnderſtanding, &amp; neglect the miniſtery of the Word, whereby this ſword is (as it were) whetted and made ſharpe, and they taught well to vſe it. Theſe fooliſh and ouer bold ſouldiers care not how vnskilfull themſelues be, or how blunt their weapon be.
                     6 They who doe all they can to bee expert in Gods word,6. Who vſe it againſt the truth. but with a trayterous minde to fight againſt the truth contained therein (as Heretikes;) yea and it may be to ouerthrow the authority of the word it ſelfe (as many Atheiſts) Theſe fight with Chriſts weapon vnder Satans colours againſt Chriſt himſelfe.

                        Sug. 1. There is no ſuch word of God at all: that Scripture which is called Gods word, was not inſpired of God, but ſo ſaid to be, onely to make men to giue greater credence thereto. Thus before Gods word was written, Satan brought men to doubt of that reuelation of Gods will which it pleaſed God to giue to man, asGen. 3. 
                              •
                           , 4. our firſt parents, and1. Pet. 3. 19, 20. the old world. Now it is written, he makes men thinke it is but as other writings of mans inuention: herewith are not onely plaine Atheiſts, but alſo many poore diſtreſſed wauering ſoules deceiued.1. Haue thy iudgement well informed in the authoritie of the Scriptures.
                     
                     
                        Anſw. For auoiding this, we muſt firſt labour to haue our iudgements well informed by what arguments wee can, of the diuine authoritie of the Scripture: many arguments might bee alledged to this purpoſe: but becauſe learned men haue taken good pains herein,Perkins in Prophe, cha. 3. &amp; in caſes of conſci. l. 2, c. 3. &amp; publiſhed that which they haue collected concerning this point, in print, I will referre the Reader to ſuch bookes: for they are euery where almoſt to be had.
                     Among other arguments this may be one, that not onely all ſorts of men (as well wicked and profane, as godly and religious) haue an inward feare, and dread of the Scripture, and beare a great reuerence thereunto, but euen they who gainſay the diuine authority of Scripture haue in their conſciences a ſecret ſting which oft pricketh them, and checketh them for it, though they labour neuer ſo much to ſuppreſſe it
                     2 We muſt pray for the Spirit of reuelation, or inſpiration,2 Pray for the ſpirit of reuelation. which may inwardly teſtifie vnto our Spirits and perſwade them that God is the Author of the holy Scriptures.Ephe. 1. 19. For howſoeuer many arguments may be brought to euict a mans iudgement thereof, ſo as in his iudgement he cannot gainſay it, yet it is only the inward teſtimony of the Spirit, which is able to perſwade mans heart thereof, and ſo make it willingly embrace and entertaine the Scripture as Gods word.
                     3 We muſt giue no place to doubting about this point,3 Giue no place to doubting. but hold it as a principle vndenyable. In humane Arts,Audiendi non ſunt qui forte dicerent, vnde ſcis illos libros vnius veri &amp; veraciſſimi dei Spiritu eſſe humano generi miniſtratos? id ipſum enim maxime credendum erat, &amp;c. Aug.

Wherefore if any ſuch ſuggeſtion be caſt into our hearts by Satan, let vs with an holy indignation (asMat. 4. 10. Chriſt did when hee was tempted to worſhip the Diuell,) bid Satan auoyde.
                  
                  
                     §. 15. Anſwer to Satans Suggeſtion of the imperfection of Gods word.
                     2 Sugg. IT is but a leaden ſword, as a noſe of waxe it may be turned euery way.Pighius, Cuſan. in Epiſt. ad Bohem. 2. &amp; 7. Heretiques, Idolaters, Schiſmatiques, profane perſons, worldlings, yea and the diuell himſelfe turne it to their owne turnes. Beſides, it is ſo blunt, as it can neither cut off errors in iudgment, nor roote out corruptions in life: for notwithſtanding the beſt application that may be made of Gods word, heretiques remaine as peruerſe in iudgement, and wicked men as obſtinate in life, as if this ſword had neuer been vſed againſt them. In theſe hath Satan much preuailed with Papiſts.
                     
                        Anſw. It is moſt falſe that Gods word is either ſo flexible or ſo blunt.Gods word a ſure rule. It is a moſtPſal. 19. 7. 8, 9. &amp; 119. 160. true, right, certaine, infallible, vndeniable word, alwayes conſtant, euer one and the ſame for euer: ſo abſolutely perfect, asReuel. 22. 18. 19. nothing can be added to it, or may be taken from it.Gal. 1. 8.

                     THat which Heretiques,Haeretici carpunt eloquia ſcripturarum, et quantum in ſe eſt maculant. Hieron in Ezec. 34. or other wicked men alleadge to iuſtifie any error in doctrine, or corruption in life, is onely the bare letter of the Word, not the true ſence thereof, and ſo not the word of God, but conceits of their owne braine: for if all the Scriptures which they alleadge, be well ſifted and throughly examined, we ſhall find them either mangled, or mingled, peruerted or miſapplied.
                     Firſt mangled by leauing out ſomthing of moment;
Pſal. 91. 11. as in the text which Satan alleadgeth to Chriſt,Mat. 4. 6. he left out this clauſe, in all thy waves, which had taken away all the force of his temptation: for it was not Chriſts way to fling himſelfe headlong from a pinacle, there being other wayes and meanes whereby he might come downe: ſo
Gen. 6. 5. in the deſcription of a naturall mans condition, this word onely is left out in the vulgar Latin tranſlation, whereby they would auoid the text alleadged againſt their ſemi-Pelagian opinion of mans being onely halfe dead in ſinne.Cuncta cogitatio cordis intenta eſſet ad malum omni tempore. So alſo in Rom. 11. 6. this clauſe is left out,
But if it be of works, then is it no more grace, otherwiſe worke is no worke. Which words are a moſt euident teſtimony againſt merit of works.
                     2 Mingled, by adding ſomething which may make for them, as the old Latin copies in Rom. 4. 2. added this word (Legis) of the Law, and thence they inferre that all works are not excluded frō iuſtifying a mā. And in al the Latin copies this wordLuke 1. 28. (full) in the Angels ſalutation to Mary is added,Aue gratia plena. whence they likewiſe gather an argument to deify the Virgin Mary.
                     
                     
                         3 Peruerted, and that two wayes, Firſt, by taking that literally which is meant figuratiuely, as that phraſe of Chriſt in the inſtitution of his laſt Supper,Mat. 26. 16. 
                        This is my body, 2 By taking that allegorically, which was ſpoken properly, as that ſpeech of Peter to Chriſt,Luke 22. 38. 
                        Here are two Swords,

                     4 Miſapplyed, by turning the places which they alleadge, to another thing then was intended by the Holy Ghoſt. As in that ſpeech of Chriſt to Peter

To ſpeake plainly, it is ſo hard and difficult, that the true meaning cannot be found out. Herein alſo are Papiſts beſotted, who alleadge to this purpoſe the words of Peter, that among thoſe points which Saint Paul deliuered in his Epiſtles,

                     IN theſe and ſuch like reſpects the Scriptures are indeed hard, which the Lord hath ſo ordered for iuſt and weighty reaſons, as

Though the word in the forenamed reſpects, and for the forenamed reaſons be difficult and obſcure, yet is it for the moſt part ſo perſpicuous, as with great profit, and to good edification,Scriptura quaſi amicus familiaris ſine fuco ad cor loquitur indoctorum atque doctorum.

And as for all the fundamentall points of Chriſtian Religion, neceſſary to ſaluation, they are clearely and plainly ſet downe, ſo as the humble and obedient heart may diſtinctly, without wauering and gainſaying, conceiue and beleeue them.Greg. Epiſt. ad Leand. Thus not vnfitly is the Scripture compared, in regard of the perſpicuity of it, to afoard, ouer which a Lambe may wade; and in regard of the difficulty of it, to a Sea, in which an Elephant may ſwimme.

It is not fit that Lay-men, Woemen, and ſuch as haue not skill in Tongues and Arts, ſhould reade it: they oft pierce and wound their own ſoules &amp; conſciences with this Sword, as children hurt themſelues with kniues. With this alſo are the Papiſts exceedingly beguiled.

                        Gods people are deſtroyed for lacke of knowledge. It is not knowledge, but the abuſe thereof which puffeth vp, and1. Cor. 8. 1. ſo much doth the Apoſtle imply. Now if the abuſe of a good thing ſhould make vs auoid it, what good thing ſhould not bee auoided? The cauſe that Miniſters, or any other are contemned, is not knowledge, but that corruption which is in man; euen as by the venome in a Spider, the ſweete iuice of a flower is turned into poiſon.
                     But the truth is,Knowledge maketh preaching to be had in eſteem that nothing maketh the preaching of Gods word to be more highly accounted of, then knowledge: for
                     1 They who know ſomething of the great myſteries of godlineſſe, if they know it aright, find ſuch good therby, that earneſtly they deſire to know more.
                     2. They deſire alſo to haue their affections wrought vpon, and that which they know, to be oft brought vnto their mindes: for which end alſo the preaching of the Word is ordained.2. Pet. 1. 13. This moued S. Peter to write.
                     3. They who know that to be true which is preached, doe in that reſpect the better attend vnto it, with greater aſſurance beleeue it, and more highly eſteeme the Preachers of it: becauſe they know it to be the truth of God. Thus the Theſſalonians receiued the Word preached1. Theſſ. 1. 5.

Theſſ. 1. 8. againſt which Chriſt will come in flaming fire to render vengeance: and a mother ſinne, which bringeth forth many other notorious ſinnes: how can any good thing come from it? Certainly this cauill which is raiſed againſt knowledge for ignorance, hath ſprung, either from Enuie, whereby men grieue at the knowledge and good parts which are in others; or from Ambition, whereby they ſeeke to be eminent aboue all other; or from Policie, ſeeking thereby a couer for their owne ignorance.Num. 11. 29.

                        AFTER that the Apoſtle,How to get and vſe the Chriſtian Armour. like a good Captaine, had ſufficiently, furniſhed the Chriſtian Souldier from toppe to toe with all needfull ſpirituall Armour, both defenſiue and offenſiue, hee proceedeth to inſtruct him how hee may get and well vſe this Armour.To all other graces adde Prayer.
                     
                     
                         The beſt generall meanes that hee could preſcribe, is prayer: for that Armour being ſpirituall and heauenly, wee fleſhly and earthly,Some take prayer to be a diſtinct part and piece of Chriſtian Armour: whereunto I agree not for two reaſons. Firſt, The forenamed pieces are ſo compleate (for by them a man is armed from top to toe) that there is no part wanting. Secondly, No outward piece of Armour is annexed to it, whereunto it ſhould bee reſembled: therefore I rather take prayer to be an eſpeciall meanes to helpe vs well to weild and vſe the forenamed Armour. we are as vnfit to vſe it, as a Childe to vſe a Gyants Armour.
                     In ſetting downe this heauenly exerciſe of prayer, hee ſo ſetteth it downe in the laſt place after all, as it hath a reference to all, and ſuch a reference as implieth a ioynt vſe of it with all the reſt: for he vſeth the participle praying,
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         as if he had ſaid, put on the whole armour of God praying, take Girdle, Breſt-plate, Shooes, Shield, Helmet and Sword, praying
                     
                     Hence I obſerue,Obſer. that To all other meanes which are vſed for defence or offence, Prayer must be added. It muſt, I ſay,
be added: neither they nor this omitted, but both ioyned together. Excellently was this of old ſet forth by the Iſraelites manner of going to battell.Oratione operatio, &amp; operatione fulciaetur oratio. Hier. in Lam. cap. 3. As the people were to goe armed, and to fight, ſoNum. 10. 9. the Prieſts were to goe with ſiluer Trumpets, and to ſound: this ſounding with ſiluer Trumpets implyed hearty and earneſt prayer. Note the benefit hereof. 2. Chron. 13. 14, &amp;c. ThusExod. 17. 9. &amp;c. while
Ioſhua and the people were fighting with the Amalakites,
Moſes ſtood lifting vp his hand, and Aaron and Hur ſtaied his hand: This was an outward figure of their inward powerfull prayer. When Moſes let fall his hand, and hee left to pray, Amalek preuailed. So while1. Sam. 7. 9, 10. Iſrael fought againſt the Philiſtims, Samuel prayed: and whilePſal. 60. 1. 
                        Ioab fought againſt Aram, Dauid prayed. The like I might inſtance in2. Chr. 14. 11

                        Hezekiah, and other Saints. If in fighting againſt fleſh and blood, Saints were thus carefull in adding prayer to other meanes, how much more ought wee ſo to doe in our ſpirituall combates againſt ſpirits?Mat. 26. 30. Chriſt in his agony prayed: and2. Cor. 12. 8. 
                        Paul when he was buffetted of the meſſenger of Satan, praied.
                     God who hath appointed meanes of ſafetie,Reaſon. will not croſſe his owne ordinance: without the vſe of them hee will not protect any. But of himſelfe no man is able to vſe the Armour aright: it is God which enableth him. Wherefore becauſe God will do nothing without vs, we muſt arme our ſelues and fight, and becauſe wee can doe nothing without God, we muſt pray.

 one of tempting God in neglect of the meanes which he hath appointed for our ſafetie: the other, of preſuming againſt God, in truſting ſo much to the meanes, as we ſeeke not to him for helpe and ſuccour. Into both theſe extreames fell the Iſraelites:
Num. 14. 2. one while they would not venture to fight, and ſo tempted the Lord:and 4. 4. another while they would needs fight of their owne head, without ſeeking helpe of the Lord, and ſo preſumed obſtinately. Rebellious are they who reiect the meanes: they cleane caſt themſelues out of the protection of God. Preſumptuous are they who truſt to the meanes, and call not vpon God; they prouoke God either

                     §. 3. Of diuiding the Word aright.
                     IN laying downe this doctrine of Prayer, the Apoſtle doth ſo skilfully couch together many ſeuerall and diſtinct points, as euery word almoſt affordeth a ſeuerall doctrine: he contenteth not himſelfe in generall to exhort vnto the dutie of prayer, but alſo declareth diuers circumſtances appertaining thereunto. Whence obſerue that
                     It is a warrantable courſe of teaching,Obſ. to ſet forth Principles of Religion in their ſeuerall and particular branches. This is one kind of

                     1 His exhortation vnto the dutie it ſelfe.

                     §. 4. Of the definition of Prayer.
                     
                        TRue Chriſtian prayer is a right opening of the deſire of the heart to God.1. Point. What prayer is.
                     
                     Heere note theſe three points. Firſt that the hearts deſire is to be opened. Secondly, that it is to be opened to God. Thirdly, that it be rightly done.
                     The very forme and eſſence of prayer conſiſteth in the opening and making knowne of a mans inward deſire, which the Scripture ſetteth forth by a metaphor of1. Sam. 1. 15. 
                        Powring out the ſoule.

                     I call it a deſire of the heart. Firſt, becauſe all deſires ariſe from the heart, that is, the fountaine of them. Secondly, to diſtinguiſh true pray er from euery ſ

                     §. 5. Of the obiect of Prayer, God onely.
                     THus is the deſire to be opened, and that to God: which
Dauid well knew, and therefore ſaith,Pſal. 38 9. 
                        Lord, all my deſire is before thee:
                        Reaſons. yea to God alone: for Prayer is a principall part of diuine ſeruice: ButMat. 4. 10. 
                        God onely ſhalt thou ſerue. Oft are we in holy Scripture called vpon, to call vpon God,Ne quis audeat preces offerre niſi, ſoli domino Deo &amp;c. Orig. contr. Cel

                           . lib. 5. but neuer by precept, promiſe, or any other way warranted to call on any other. The true Saints, whoſe prayers haue beene approued, haue euer prayed vnto God, neuer vnto any other. And that vpon iuſt and waightie reaſons.
                     Firſt,Ier. 17. 10. God onely knoweth whether our deſire come from the heart within, or from teeth outward, and ſo can diſtinguiſh whether it be true prayer (euen a powring out of the ſoule) or no.
                     Secondly, God onely isIer. 23. 23. euery where preſent, in all places, to heare the ſuites of all perſons.
                     Thirdly, God only isLuke 1. 34. Almightie, able to grant vs what ſute ſoeuer we ſhall make.
                     
                        Obiect. One creature may be helpefull to another, why therefore may not prayer be made of one to another?
                     
                        Anſw.
                        Why no creature is to be prayed vnto. Firſt, no creature can of it ſelfe be helpefull to any other, further then God ſuffereth and enableth it.
                     2. It is not a ſufficient ground to moue vs to call vpon a creature, becauſe it may be helpefull (for then many vnreaſonable creatures might bee prayed vnto, which is a moſt vnreaſonable thing for any reaſonable man to doe) we muſt know that he to whom we pray, heareth vs, and is both willing and able to ſuccour vs. But this can wee know of no inuiſible creature, whether Angell or Saint departed: we neither know where they are, nor what they can doe. In vaine therefore it is to call on them.
                     
                         3.Difference betwixt diuine and ciuil prayer. Difference muſt be made betwixt ciuill and diuine prayer. This is made with aſſurance of faith, and perſwaſion of diuine attributes in him to whom we make it, together with religious adoration, which isReu. 19. 10. proper to the diuine Maieſtie, and to be performed to no creature, neither
and 22. 9. Angell,Acts 10. 26. nor man. And this is it whereof heere we ſpeake, and whereof all the queſtion is betwixt vs and our aduerſaries.
                     Ciuill Prayer is that which is made onely in ciuill reſpects; and that in ſuch particular things wherein we are perſwaded they to whom it is made, can helpe vs: as to pray Miniſters to teach and inſtruct vs in the way to eternall life; to pray Magiſtrates to relieue vs againſt the wrongs of vniuſt men; to pray Phyſitians in ſickneſſe to helpe vs; and to pray others the like wherein they are able. Yet ſo to ſeeke helpe of theſe, as of Gods inſtruments, whom God hath prouided to help, and in that reſpect to cal vpon God, and depend vpon him for his bleſſing on that helpe which man affordeth vnto vs. Thus we deny not but that ciuill prayer may bee made to men liuing and conuerſing with vs, to whom wee may make knowne our deſire by outward meanes. But religious prayer is to be made to God alone.
                  
                  
                     §. 6. Of the reaſons why our deſire is to be made knowne to God.
                     
                        Queſt. VVHat need is there that any prayer ſhould be made to God at all?Pſal 44. 21. 
                        God knoweth the ſecrets of our heart, and
                        and 139. 2. 
                        vnderſtandeth our thought a far off.
                     
                     
                        Auſ.
                        Why it is needfull to make knowne our deſire to God. Prayer is made not ſimply to make knowne the deſire and thoughts of our hearts to God, ſo as otherwiſe God might bee ignorant of them, but to teſtifie mans obedience to that order which God hath ſet downe. For it hath pleaſed God in his vnſearchable wiſdome, to appoint prayer a meanes to obtaine all needfull bleſſings at his hands. Were there no other reaſon to ſhew the equitie hereof, but Gods ordinance and commandement, it were ſufficient: but this hath God appointed very wiſely for many good reaſons: as,
                     1. That it might appeare we vnderſtand our owne deſires, and haue a ſence of the thing we want.
                     2. That we may not onely know, but acknowledge God the Author and fountaine of all bleſſings.
                     3. That wee may manifeſt our faith in his gracious promiſes, and good guiding prouidence.
                     4. That when we receiue the good thing we haue aſked, we might aſcribe the praiſe thereof to God. For the making knowne of our wants to God, and crauing ſupply of them at his hands, is a meanes to make vs acknowledge that, that ſupply which we haue is made by him, and that the praiſe thereof is due to him.
                  
                  
                     §. 7. Of the things which are requiſite to the right maner of prayer.
                     THe third thing in the definition of Praier (in this word right) is not lightly to bee paſſed ouer: many points are compriſed vnder it: they may all be drawne to theſe two heads, 1 The Matter 2 The Maner of Prayer.
                     The Matter in general muſt be things lawful and good.
                        How to pray aright.
                     
                     The Maner reſpecteth, 1 The Perſons both to whom the prayer is made, and alſo who maketh it. 2. The thing which is prayed for.
                     The Perſon to whom we pray being God (as we heard) two eſpecial properties of him muſt bee regarded in prayer, 1. His Greatneſſe. 2. His Goodneſſe.
                     
                         Theſe two are implied in the Preface of the Lords Prayer. The word heauen, where he is ſaid to be, ſheweth his greatneſſe: the title Father, his goodneſſe. The Throne of God before which we appeare in prayer, is a throne of
glory, and of grace: Gods glory and grace therefore muſt be duely weighed.
                     A due conſideration of the former will moue vs,
                     1. To ſeeke out a fit Mediator.
                     2. With all reuerence to caſt our ſelues before God.
                  
                  
                     §. 8. Of praying in the mediation of Chriſt.
                     IF the greatneſſe and glory of God be duely weighed,1 Pray in the mediation of Chriſt. we ſhall finde it to be ſo infinite, as no creature, much leſſe weake ſinfull man, can endure the brightneſſe thereof.
Eſay 6. 2. It is noted of the Angels, that when they ſtand before the preſence of God, they couer their faces with their wings. If the glorious Angels cannot endure the great and glorious Maieſtie of God, how ſhould vile ſinners, to whom God in himſelfe isDeut. 4. 24. 
                        A conſuming fire? Which being ſo, there is an abſolute neceſſitie of a fit Mediator. This was prefigured vnder the Law by the High Prieſt,
Exod. 28. 29. who did beare the names of the children of Iſrael before the Lord.
                        1. Tim. 2. 5. This Mediator is onely one,
                        Quid eſt dulcius quam genitorem in nomine vnigeniti innocare? &amp;c. quem. atium. dirigam tibi interceſſerem neſcio, niſi bunc qui. eſt propitiatio pro peccatis noſtris. Aug. med. c. 5. euen the man Ieſus Christ. No other in heauen or earth was fit for that office, but onely hee who was both God and Man, a true, proper, naturall Sonne of both, and ſo fit to bring man into Gods preſence.Heb. 4. 14. This, and this alone maketh vs with boldneſſe appeare before the Maieſtie of God.
                     They who pray to God without a mediator, as Pagans, or in the name of any other mediatour but Chriſt, as Papiſts, pray not aright in this reſpect, neither can they ſtand with comfort before God, when he ſhall manifeſt his Maieſtie and iealouſie.
                     
                         But they who by the onely begotten Sonne of God, are brought into the preſence of God, doe further in regard of Gods excellencie, carry themſelues with all reuerence and due reſpect vnto him.
                     This reuerence muſt firſt be grounded in the heart, and then manifeſted by our words and geſture in prayer.
                  
                  
                     §. 9. Of inward reuerence in prayer.
                     THat in our hearts wee may feare God,2 Pray in feare. and thinke of him reuerently, wee muſt both before prayer meditate of his glory and excellencie (for ſo ſhall wee come with hearts raiſed vp from the dunghill of this earth to the glorious Throne of heauen, as the Prophet ſaith.
Lam. 3. 41. 
                        Let vs lift vp our hearts, &amp;c.) and alſo while we are in prayer, hold our hearts cloſe with God, that they be not carried away with vaine thoughts, and wandering imaginations: for our prayers are then butEſay 29. 13. lip-labour, nothing acceptable to God.

Curioſitie of ſtyle hindereth denotion, and argueth affectation: it ſheweth that men in praying ſeek their owne praiſe, rather then Gods. A looſe ſtile (to ſay the leaſt) argueth too light eſteeme, and too great neglect of him to whom wee make our prayer.

This geſture Chriſt warranteth.Luke 18. 13. The poore humble Publican ſtood when he prayed. To pray ſitting, leaning, lying, with hat on head, &amp;c. when no neceſſitie requireth, argueth little reuerence and humilitie.

For ſtrengthening our faith in prayer, we muſt ſeriouſly meditate of the promiſes concerning ſuch things as we pray for, and of Gods truth in performing them, as2. Sam. 7. 27, 28. 
                        Dauid did.

                     FOr the perſon that prayeth, two things are requiſite in regard of himſelfe.
                     1 Lowlineſſe of minde.
                     2 Holineſſe of life.
                     Lowlineſſe of minde cauſeth an vtter deniall of our ſelues,6 Pray with lowlineſſe of minde. when in truth we know and acknowledge that in vs is no ground of confidence, but altogether matter of deſpaire. Of this minde was Dauid (when he ſaidPſal. 143. 2.

                     For attaining to this grace,How the mind is made lowly. we muſt impartially weigh our owne baleneſſe, as Abraham, who ſaid,Gen. 18. 27.

                     Vnderſtanding and ſence reſpecteth both good things and euill. If we pray for good things, we muſt both know they are worth the hauing: and alſo ſencibly feele the want of them. Such are thoſeMatth. 5. 3. 
                        poore is ſpirit, whom Chriſt pronounceth bleſſed.
                     
                         It we pray againſt euill, we muſt both know that they are in themſelues heauy burdens, and alſo feele that they lie vpon vs, asPſal. 32. 4. &amp; 38. 4. 
                        Dauid did: otherwiſe we ſhall neuer pray heartily for the one, or againſt the other.
                  
                  
                     §. 14. Of our deſire in Prayer.
                     OVr deſire in Prayer muſt bee both ſincere and feruent, euen an hungring, thirſting, longing deſire.9 &amp; 10. Vnder theſe metaphors the deſires of the faithfull are oft ſet forth.Pray in ſincerity of heart, &amp; with feruency of ſpirit. Now hungry and thirſty perſons, and women that long, doe both in truth, and alſo with great earneſtneſſe deſire that which they deſire. If in Prayer our deſire be ſuch, it will pierce the Heauens, and moue God to yeeld vnto it: if it be not a true and ſincere deſire, but complementall and hypocriticall, it is no prayer of the heart, but meere lip labour, and ſo no whit acceptable to him who ſearcheth the heart. If it be not feruent, but a cold deſire, it cannot pierce ſo high as Heauen. For as a bullet flieth no further then the heate and force of powder driueth it: ſo Prayer no further then the feruour of ſpirit carrieth it. Be thereforeRom. 12. 11. 
                        feruent in ſpirit. We heard that the Prayer of a righteous man auatleth much, but with this Prouiſo,Iam. 5. 16. 
                        If it be feruent.
                     
                     Thus in generall we ſee what Prayer is: whereby wee may be directed how to pray. Now let vs ſee what motiues there be to ſtirre vs vp thereunto.
                  
                  
                     §. 15. Of the firſt motiue to Prayer, Gods command.
                     I Might here vrge Gods expreſſe charge and commandement thereunto,Motiues to Prayer 1 Gods charge. which is oft inculcated thorowout the Scripture: a motiue ſufficient though there were no other. For Gods Precepts being wilfully contemned, or careleſly neglected, procure no leſſe penalty then eternall deſtruction of body and ſoule. It ſhould ſeeme that this motiue preuailed much with Dauid (for ſo ſoone asPſal. 27. 8 the Lord ſaid, Seeke ye my face, his heart anſwered,
O Lord, I will ſeeke thy face;) and much will it preuaile with all ſuch as deſire to approue themſelues to God. But becauſe it is a generall motiue vnto all Chriſtians whatſoeuer, I will no longer inſiſt vpon it. Particular motiues haue reſpect either to God, vnto whom we pray, or vnto our ſelues who pray.
                  
                  
                     §. 16. Of the ſecond motiue to Prayer, Gods worſhip.
                     FOr God,2 The moſt principall part of Gods worſhip. Firſt Prayer is a part, the moſt principal, eſpeciall and proper part of Gods worſhip. Dauid ioyneth them together, ſaying, Let vs worſhip and fall downe, &amp;c. That is, by falling downe, and calling vpon God, let vs worſhip him.
                     2 Among other parts of Gods worſhip,Kneeling. the moſt reuerend geſture is applied, and euen appropriated to this.
                     3 The place of God worſhip was by an excellency termed,Eſay 56: 7. 
                        The Houſe of Prayer.
                     
                     4 Prayer is made an eſſentiall note of difference betwixt ſuch as worſhip God, and ſuch as worſhip him not.
2 Tim. 2. 19 They are ſaid to call vpon God:
                        1 Cor. 1. 2. Theſe,Acts 9. 14. 
                        not to call vpon God.

                     §. 17. Of the third motiue, Gods honour.
                     2 IT is the beſt and chiefeſt meanes of honouring God that can be:3 Nothing whereby God is more honoured. by it we acknowledge God
                     1 To be euery where preſent, and in euery place to heare his children, and on this ground euery where we call on him.
                     
                         2 To be the fountaine of all bleſſing, and therefore when our ſelues or others want any bleſſing temporall or ſpirituall, by prayer we aske it of God: yea, when we receiue any, we giue the praiſe of it to God.
                     3 To be a God full of pitty and compaſſion, which maketh vs to lay open our griefes and diſtreſſes to him.
                     4 To be an Almighty God, able to giue whatſoeuer we deſire.
                     5 To be a bountifull God, who giueth to all liberally, and vpbraideth not.
                     6 To be a God true of his promiſes, and therefore we craue the accompliſhment of them.
                     Theſe and otherlike properties of God doth faithfull prayer ſet forth; and ſo bring great honour to God, in which reſpect God himſelfe ſaith,Pſal. 50. 15. 
                        Call vpon me, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 18. Of the fourth motiue, the neceſsity of Prayer.
                     FOr our ſelues, foure points there be which commend this holy exerciſe.

                           1 The neceſſitie. of prayer.
                           2 The vtilitie. of prayer.
                           3 The efficacie. of prayer.
                           4 The dignitie. of prayer.
                        
                     
                     1 If any good thing be neceſſary to a Chriſtian,4 Abſolutely neceſſary. praier muſt needs be neceſſary, becauſe it is that meanes which God hath appointed to obtaine euery good thing,Mat. 7. 7 
                        Aske and it ſhall be giuen you, ſaith the Lord, which giueth all:
Iam. 4. 3 
                        Ye get nothing, becauſe ye aske not, ſaith his Apoſtle: we haue no good thing in our ſelues, or of our ſelues, all is hid in God: he is the fountaine of all bleſſing; but he is a deepe well: we muſt haue ſomething to draw vp water: the onely meanes is prayer. Is it not neceſſary that a poore man that hath not of his owne a crumme of bread or drop of water, ſhould make his want knowne to ſuch as can and will releeue him? How much more neceſſary is it that Chriſtians ſhould make their wants knowne to God, ſeeing otherwiſe there is no hope of receiuing reliefe from him?
                  
                  
                     §. 19. Of the things which men receiue without calling vpon God.
                     
                        Obiect. MAny prophane and wicked men who neuer call vpon God, receiue many bleſſings from God.Mat. 5. 45. 
                        He maketh his Sunne to ariſe on the euill, and ſendeth raine on the vniuſt.
                     
                     
                        Anſ. 1. The things which ſuch receiue are euen as nothing, not to be ſpoken of, becauſe they tend not truly &amp; properly to their good: al that they receiue are either temporal things, or only reſtraining graces, which tend rather to the good of others, then of them which receiue them.
                     2 Such perſons were much better want all thoſe things then haue them: for becauſe they call not on God, God giueth them no grace well to vſe them, ſo as they abuſe them to their owne deſtruction:2 Sam. 17. 23 
                        Achitophels wit,1 Sam. 17. 9 
                        Goliahs ſtrength,Acts 12. 23. 
                        Herods eloquence, were the cauſe of their ouerthrow in this World: and though all haue not like ends in this World, yet all heape vp wrath vnto themſelues againſt the day of wrath. Reade Rom. 2. 4. 5.
                     3 That ſpirit which commeth accompanied with all needfull ſauing and ſanctifying graces, is not gotten without Prayer. Luk. 11. 13.
                        God giueth the holy Ghoſt to them that deſire him.

                     2 THe vtility or profit of Prayer is much euery manner of way.5. Euery way profitable. It is profitable,
                     
                         1 To obtaine euery good thing,1. To obtaine good things. as is euident by the promiſe of Chriſt (Ioh. 16. 23.) Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, whatſoeuer ye ſhall aske the Father in my name, he will giue it you. Note the certainty of this promiſe in Chriſts vehement aſſeueration: Note the generality of it, Whatſoeuer.

The Heathen among whom the Chriſtians liued after the Apoſtles dayes, obſeruing ſo much, ſaid; There was nothing which Chriſtians could not obtaine of God by Prayer. I might here particularly exemplifie this by ſeuerall inſtances of all kinds of bleſſings, ſpirituall and temporall, publike and priuate, for our ſelues and others, concerning this life and a better, and ſhew how Gods children haue by Prayer obtained them: and alſo declare ſeuerall promiſes made by God for all theſe. But I haue in part declared theſeTreatiſe 2: Part 6. §. 72, 73, &amp;c. before, and I ſhall haue fitter occaſion to handle them,2. To preuent or remoue euils. when I ſpeake of the matter of prayer.

                        Acts 8. 22. 
                        Pray God, that if it be poſſible the thought of thine heart may be forgiuen thee: whereby he implieth that if remiſſion of ſinnes may be obtained by any meanes, Praier is that meanes.
                     5 To ſubdue in vs the power of ſin,5 To ſubdue ſinne. which Dauid well knowing, praiedPſal. 19. 13, &amp; 119. 133. that ſin might not haue dominion ouer him.
                         I dare boldly auouch (and I dout not but euery Chriſtian ſoule, that is acquainted with this holy exerciſe of prayer, can by experience iuſtifie the truth of what I ſhall auouch) that the more conſtant and powerfull a man is in prayer, the leſſe power ſinne hath in him; the more ſin preuaileth, the weaker is the ſpirit of prayer: when Gods children fall into temptation, and yeeld vnto ſinne, their ſoules are intangled thereby, as a bird whoſe feathers are beſmeared with birdlime, or whoſe feete are caught in a ſnare: they cannot flye vp to heauen. If by prayer they keepe their hearts aloft, they are the more free from being intangled by Satan. Faithfull prayer, and purpoſe to ſin, cannot ſtand together. In this reſpect I may not vnfitly compare the ſpirit of prayer, to that ſpirit and breath which commeth from the lungs of a man, whereby that ouer-great heate, which otherwiſe would drie vp all his radicall and naturall moiſture, is cooled and allayed, for it is prayer which cooleth and allayeth in man the immoderate heate of luſt, anger, malice, enuy, &amp;c.
                     6 To ſanctifie all Gods creatures vnto our vſe:6 To ſanctifie the things we doe, or vſe. for as Gods word giueth a warrant for the vſing of the creatures which are needfull, and a direction whereby we are taught how to vſe them; ſo prayer to God obtaineth a right vnto them, and a bleſſing vpon them: therefore the Apoſtle ioyneth both theſe together, and ſaith that the creature1. Tim 4. 5. 
                        is ſanctified by the Word and prayer. For this endMat. 14. 19. &amp; 15. 36. &amp; 26. 26. Chriſt vſually prayed before he vſed the creature: and all, euen they who haue abundance, muſt pray, Giue vs this day our daily bread, that they may haue a right vnto, and a bleſſing vpon the creatures which they vſe: the like may be ſaid of the callings wherein we are placed, of the actions which we do, and of al things which we haue or vſe, all are ſanctified by prayer: who without prayer doe, or vſe any thing, are vſurpers, and can looke for no bleſſing.
                     To conclude, Prayer is profitable vnto all things.
                  
                  
                     §. 21. Of the reſpects wherein ones Prayer is not heard.
                     
                        Obiect. AGainſt all that is ſaid of the profit of Prayer, ſome obiect, that the Prayers of many are fruitleſſe: they obtaine not the things deſired: yea, that God ſweareth he would not heare Ier. 15. 1. 
                        Moſes, Samuel,
                        Ezek. 14. 1 Iam. 4. 3 
                        Noah, Daniel, Iob.
                     
                     
                        Anſwer. 1 Many pray amiſſe, and ſo receiue not; wherefore that out Prayers may be profitable, we muſt learne to pray aright, as we haue beene directed before.
                     2 Though God alwaies grant not his ſeruants requeſt inſtantly, yet afterwards when there is a more ſeaſonable time he doth; for God is the Lord of times and ſeaſons, and beſt knoweth which is the fitteſt ſeaſon, both for his owne glory and his childrens good to grant their requeſt. For this end did not Chriſt at firſt grantIohn 2 4. 7 his Mothers requeſt, when ſhee deſired ſupply of wine; norMat. 15. 23, &amp;c. the requeſt of the Cananite which ſhee made for her daughter. Note his anſwer to his Diſciples:Acts 1. 7 
                        It is not for you to know the times or the ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his owne power.
                     
                     3 Though he heare them not in that particular, yet in as good, or in a better thing will he heare them. As2 Cor. 12, 8, 9. when
Paul prayed againſt a temptation, God gaue him grace ſufficient to reſiſt it; and whenMat. 26. 39 Chriſt praied to haue his bitter cup remoued, God enabled him to drink it; wherevpon it is ſaid, thatHeb. 5. 7 
                        he was heard in that which he feared.

                        Dauid prayed for his childe that died, yet was not his prayer in vaine; for firſt his prayer was a ſacrifice acceptable to God. Secondly,Verſe 23. God had mercy on the ſoule of his childe. Thirdly, God gaue him another ſonne of the ſame mother, a24, 25. 
                        Salomon, a Iedediah, a Prince of peace, beloued of the Lord, whom God made King after Dauid. God better knoweth what is good for vs then wee doe our ſelues: accordingly, though he heare vs not alwaies to our owne will, and grant what wee ſuppoſe to be good, yet alwaies he heareth vs to his owne will, and granteth what he knoweth to be good for vs.
                     4 The Saints well know what God hath abſolutely promiſed (as all needfull ſauing graces, and ſaluation it ſelfe, thoſe abſolutely they pray for and obtaine:) and what conditionally, as all temporall things, and ſuch like as may make ſometime to their aduantage, and ſometime to their damage. Theſe they pray for with a ſubiection of their owne wils to Gods, asMat. 26. 39. Chriſt vnto his Father, Not as I will, but as thou wilt; and the Leaper to Chriſt,Mar. 1. 40. 
                        If thou wilt thou canſt make mee cleane; and Dauid to God,

                     That which was obiected of Moſes, Samuel, Noah, Daniel, Iob, is but a meere ſuppoſition, not a thing done: beſides, it is ſaid;Ezek. 14. 14

Voluntarily God yeeldeth to all that he ſeemeth to be forced vnto: yea he hath before-hand determined ſo to doe; but as he appointeth the thing to be done, ſo the meanes whereby it is done: without the meanes nothing ſhall be done, vpon a right vſe of the meanes all things ſhall be effected: now prayer being the meanes appointed by God of procuring bleſſing, and auoyding iudgement, Prayer may fitly be ſaid (in regard of that order which God hath voluntarily ſet downe) to be of power with God.
                  
                  
                     §. 24. Of extraordinary effects of Prayer.
                     MAny admirable, and extraordinary are the things which the Prayers of Gods faithfull children haue in all ages effected.Exo. 14. 15, 16. At Moſes Prayer the red Sea was diuided aſunder.Iof. 10. 12. At Ioſuahs Prayer the Sunne ſtayed his courſe.Iſa. 38. 2, 8. At Hezekiahs Prayer it turned backward. At
Iam. 5. 17. 
                        Eliahs Prayer raine was ſtayed three yeeres and an halfe together, infinite it were to reckon vp all particulars. I wil bring to your remembrance onely one which among and aboue the reſt is moſt remarkeable, which is concerning
Luk. 3. 21, 22 Chriſts Prayer at his baptiſme, by the power wherof firſt the heauens were clouen. Secondly, the holy Ghoſt deſcended downe vpon him. Thirdly, the Father gaue an euident and audible teſtimony that Chriſt was his beloued Sonne: whereby is declared that the Prayers of Gods children pierce the heauens, make the holy Ghoſt to come into them, and cauſe God to witneſſe that they are his children, though not ſo viſibly and audibly, yet as truely and effectually.
                  
                  
                     §. 25. Of the vſe which we may make of efficacy of extraordinary Prayers.
                     
                        Obiect. THeſe are extraordinary examples of extraordinary perſons, who had an extraordinary ſpirit: ſo as ordinary perſons can looke for no ſuch matters: As for Chriſt, he was the true naturall Sonne of God.
                     
                        Anſw. 1 Theſe things are recorded to ſhew the power and efficacy of Prayer.Iam. 5. 17. To which purpoſe Saint
Iames alledgeth that extraordinary example of the Prayer of Eliah. And the argument will well follow from the greater to the leſſe. For if God heard his ſeruants in extraordinary matters, will he not much more heare vs in ſuch ordinary matters as we ſtand in need of, and he hath promiſed to giue vs?
                     2 Though Chriſt were the only begotten Son of God, and the proper obiect of his loue, yet in, and thorow Chriſt, God hath adopted vs to be his children: and with that loue he beareth vnto Chriſt, he loueth vs: ſo as if we call vpon him in Chriſts name,Reu. 8. 3, 4. he will hearken vnto to vs as vnto his children, and accept of our Prayers, as if Chriſt had made them: for he offereth them vp vnto his Father.
                     
                        Thus we ſee that
                        Iam. 5. 16. the prayer of a righteous man auaileth much.

                     4 THere is no one thing wherein and whereby God doth more honour his ſeruants,7 A matter of great dignity then by vouchſafing vnto them this high priuiledge and ſauour to pray vnto him. By prayer haue the Saints a free acceſſe vnto the glorious throne of Gods grace: yea they haue a familiar acquaintance with him. It is a great prerogatiue, that God in his Word vouchſafeth to ſpeake to man; but not comparable to this, that man ſhould talke with God. God by his Word ſpeaketh to all, euen to the wicked and rebellious, but none but Saints by Prayer ſpeake to him: (the Prayer of the wicked is no Prayer, but meere lip-labour.) We know that it implyeth much more familiarity for an inferiour freely to ſpeake to his ſuperior,Eſther 5. 2. then a ſuperior to his inferior. Eſther though a Queene, accounted it a great fauour, that ſhe was louingly and kindly accepted, when ſhe approached into the preſence of a mortall Monarch. Now conſider how infinitely farre greater the diuine Maieſty is, then any humane can be, and this will ſhew how high a dignity it is to haue a free acceſſe vnto his glorious preſence; eſpecially if withall we conſider how full of grace and goodneſſe he is to all that come before him. The glorious Angels doe admire the Saints, in regard of this honour vouchfafed vnto them.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 27. A Collection of the motiues to Prayer.
                     THus we ſee what ſtrong motiues here be to vrge this duty. If either Gods honour, or our owne honour; if to pleaſe God, or to ſupply our own needs, and neceſſities; if our own profit &amp; benefit be any motiues hereunto, motiues are not wanting. What exerciſe on earth ſo heauenly? and yet what, whereunto we are more dull? O that ſo rare and excellent a duty, ſhould ſo rarely and ſlightly be performed, as commonly it is! Doth not this argue as the great corruption of our nature, ſo the ſubtill malice of the diuell? For wel he knoweth the vantage that man gaineth, and damage which cometh to him by Prayer. Let vs be grieued and humbled for our dulneſſe and careleſneſſe herein. Let vs rowſe vp our ſpirits and pray, that we may pray.

                        HItherto of the duty it ſelfe whereunto we are exhorted:II. Point. The kinds of Prayer. we are now to handle the particular circumſtances, or branches of the Apoſtles direction.
                     The firſt is concerning the kindes of Prayer, which are firſt intimated vnder that generall particle
All, and then exemplified by two particular inſtances, 1 Prayer, 2 Supplication.
                     
                     
                         That we may diſtinctly handle the ſeuerall kinds of prayer, which are here in this Text compriſed vnder this word All, and in other places of Scripture more expreſly ſet downe; I will draw them into ſome order.
                     Prayer may firſt be diſtinguiſhed according to the matter, and manner thereof.
                     In regard of the matter, the1 Tim. 2. 1. Apoſtle maketh foure ſeuerall heads.
                     1 Supplications,

                         or deprecations which are for the remouall of euill.
                     2 Prayers,
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         which are for the obtaining of good.

                     Vnder Requeſts he comprehendeth ſupplication and
Prayer, vnder which alſo may be compriſed interceſsion.
                     
                     Againe,1 Theſſ. 5. 17. 18. in another place he mentioneth onely two heads.
                     
                        1 Prayer.
                        2 Thankſ-giuing.
                     
                     By Prayer, he meaneth petition. For when this word
Prayer is ſet alone, it compriſeth all the kinds vnder it: when it is ioyned with thankſgiuing alone, it compriſeth all kinds belonging to requeſt. When it is ioyned with deprecation or interceſſion, it is reſtrained to a deſire of good things for our ſelues.
                     The moſt generall and vſuall diſtinction is grounded on 1 Theſſ. 5. 17, 18. which is
                     Petition.
                     Thankſgiuing.
                     
                        Petition may be diſtributed according to the things or
perſons in reſpect whereof it is made.
                     The things which it reſpecteth are either good, to obtaine them, which is moſt properly Prayer; or euill, to remoue them, which is Supplication; ſo called in Engliſh, becauſe when we are oppreſſed with any euill, it maketh vs caſt downe our ſelues as poore ſuppliants, crauing helpe and redreſſe.
                     The perſons are our ſelues or others. The forenamed kinds reſpect our ſelues. That which reſpecteth others,
is interceſsion: and that is either for them, or againſt them.
                     According to this diſtribution we ſhall handle vnder Prayer, put for Petition,
                     1 Petition for good things.
                     2 Deprecation to remoue euill things.
                     3 Interceſſion for others.

                     §. 29. Of the things to be asked in Prayer.
                     1. FOr Petition,1 Kind. Petition for good things. I need not ſtand to proue the general, that it is lawfull to craue good things: for this of all others is the moſt principall kind of Prayer. And this generall title Prayer, is moſt commonly attributed to it. I will rather more particularly ſhew,
                     1 What things we are to craue.
                     2 After what manner we are to craue them.
                     The things which may be asked, muſt be lawfull and good: for ſo much implyeth Chriſt where he ſaith, that
Mat. 7. 11. God will giue good things to them that aske him. Now thoſe things are lawfull and good which are agreeable to the good will of God: for Gods will is not onely the rule and ſquare of goodneſſe, but the very ground of goodneſſe. A thing is not firſt good, and then willed of God; but therefore good, becauſe it is willed of God: ſo as Gods will giueth the very eſſence and being vnto goodneſſe. WheruponHeb. 13. 21. the Apoſtle hauing prayed for the Hebrewes, that God would make them perfect in all
good wokes, addeth by way of explanation, to doe his will. This general point of framing our petitions according to Gods will, Saint Iohn expreſly layeth downe, ſaying1 Iohn 5. 14. 
                        If we aske any thing according to his will, he heareth vs. Would we then know what are thoſe good and lawfull things which may be asked? Search the Scriptures, for in them is Gods will reuealed. If we haue our warrant from thence for the good things we aske, then may we boldly aske, and looke to receiue them.
                  
                  
                     §. 30. Of the Summe of the Lords Prayer.
                     BVt becauſe this is a large field,What good things are to be asked in prayer. and a wide Sea, Chriſt hath made an epitome, a briefe collection of all ſuch things as are good and lawfull to be asked, and compriſed them in thoſe few petitions of the Lords Prayer. Where we may obſerue two ſeuerall heads of them.
                     1 Gods glory, in the three firſt petitions, wherein praying to God, we ſay, Thy Name, Thy Kingdome, Thy will.
                     
                     2 Our owne good, in the three laſt: wherein ſpeaking of our ſelues, we ſay, Our bread, Our treſpaſſes, Lead vs not, But deliuer vs.
                     
                     
                        Gods glory, is firſt of all, and moſt of all to be deſired

                     In regard of our owne good, we may aske all needful
                           •
                         things, whether they be4 Petition.

                        Sanctification, in keeping vs from the pollution of ſinne, and preſeruing vs ſafe from all euill vnto ſaluation. The Scripture affordeth particular inſtances of all theſe things asked of God by the prayers of the Saints. But this warrant of the Lords Prayer being ſo ſufficient, I neede no longer to inſiſt vppon it.
                  
                  
                     §. 31. Of the diuers manner of asking things abſolutely, and conditionally promiſed.
                     HAuing ſeene what we muſt aske, let vs ſee how wee muſt aske.
                     Wee haue heard before of many graces needfull for a right manner of prayer, which I will not here repeate, but onely ſhew how all things muſt be asked with ſubiection of our will vnto Gods will.Concerning abſolute, and not abſolute promiſes, See Treat. 2 Par. 6. §. 75. 76. For this end reſpect muſt be had to Gods promiſes. For euery acceptable prayer is made in faith: Faith hath an eye to Gods promiſes, and reſteth thereon: as God hath promiſed any thing, ſo the faithfull aske it in Prayer. Things abſolutely promiſed, they craue abſolutely, asExod. 32. 10 11. 
                        Moſes, who would not let God alone, till he had ſpared his people, butVerſe 32. deſired to be raced out of Gods Booke, rather then his people ſhould be deſtroyed: and why? becauſe God had made an abſolute promiſe to bring them into Canaan,
                        Verſe 13. which promiſe Moſes pleadeth vnto God in his prayer.
                     Things not abſolutely promiſed they pray for with ſubiection vnto Gods will and wiſdome. For there are many things which are good in their kinde, yet ſo farre make more or leſſe to Gods glory and mans good, as it pleaſeth God by his wiſe prouidence to diſpoſe them. For example, God hath made an abſolute promiſe of the perpetuall continuance of the Church, but not of a continuall outward flouriſhing eſtate thereof; for hee can turne the perſecution of his Church to the encreaſe therof,Sanguis Martyrum ſemen Eccleſiae. and ſo gaine honour to himſelfe, and bring good vnto his people thereby. Thus for the time of accompliſhing Gods promiſes, ſometimes a long date, ſometimes a ſhort date, may moſt make to his glory: and for the meanes, ſometimes one kind of meanes, ſometimes another, with other like circumſtances.
                     In all theſe, wee muſt in our Prayers either expreſſe, or reſerue in our minds ſome ſecret limitations; as theſe, If God ſee it to be good; if his good pleaſure be ſuch; if it may ſtand with his glory, &amp;c.

What we are to pray againſt, and how. Euill to be prayed againſt, is either of fault, or of puniſhment.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 33. Of praying againſt ſinne.
                     EVill of fault is ſinne.
                        1 Sinne. This is the firſt euill that euer was in the World: the greateſt of all euils (a greater euill then the torment of hell) and the cauſe of all euill of puniſhment (forIam. 1. 15 
                        ſinne when it is finiſhed bringeth forth death.)
                     In regard of this euill, three things are to be prayed againſt, 1. The guilt of ſinne, 2. The power of it, 3. Temptations thereunto.
                     Againſt the firſt we pray in the fifth Petition: againſt the ſecond and third in the ſixth Petition. In regard of the firſt Dauid thus prayeth,Pſal. 51. 2. 
                        Waſh me thorowly from mine iniquity, and cleanſe me from my ſinne. In regard of the ſecond, thus;&amp; 19. 12. 
                        Let not preſumptuous ſinnes haue dominion ouer me. In regard of the third, Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples;Mat 26. 41. 
                        Pray, that ye enter not into temptation.
                     
                     The guilt of ſinne maketh vs odious and abominable in Gods ſight, whoſe fauour cauſeth our happineſſe. The
power of ſinne maketh vs more and more to prouoke his wrath, which is vnſupportable.
                     Temptations vnto ſinne ſimply in themſelues worke neither of thoſe two miſchiefes. For Chriſt (who was alwaies moſt amiable in Gods ſight,Col. 1. 13 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                        Peter when he told him of his ſuffering: but all his temptations could neuer make him ſinne. As a fire-brand thruſt into the Sea is preſently quenched, ſo were all temptations caſt againſt Chriſt. Yet notwithſtanding temptations to vs are very dangerous, becauſe of our proneneſſe &amp; readineſſe to yeeld vnto them. We are by nature to temptations, as tinder; or rather as gunpowder is to fire. As the leaſt ſparke of fire doth not onely ſoone kindle, but alſo ſuddenly in flame gunpowder, and ſets it all on fire: ſo euery little temptation ſoone faſtneth on vs, and inflameth vs ſuddenly with the fire of ſinne. Inſtance2 Sam: 11. 2. 
                        Dauid, who at the ſight of Bathſheba was inflamed with luſt; andMa. 26. 69. 
                        Peter, who at the word of a ſilly maide was ſoone brought to denie and forſweare his maſter. If theſe in whom Gods renewing Spirit abode, were by reaſon of the fleſh ſo prone to be ouertaken by temptations, how can ſuch ſtand againſt them, in whom the fleſh reigneth, and where is nothing to reſtraine them?
                  
                  
                     §. 34. Of the manner of praying againſt the guilt and power of ſin, and temptations thereto.
                     AGainſt the guilt and power of ſinne, we muſt ſimply, abſolutely, inſtantly pray, and neuer ceaſe till God heare vs.
                     That we may with the greater indignation pray againſt them,How to pray with indignation againſt ſinne. we muſt firſt narrowly and thorowly examine our ſelues, and ſearch what ſinnes we haue committed; and amongſt our many ſinnes, obſerue which are the moſt odious, which the moſt dangerous, what ſinnes wee are moſt addicted vnto, and what beare greateſt ſway in vs. Thus when we ſee what greeuous ſinnes we are ſlaues vnto, we ſhall with great vehemency, asPſ. 51. 1, &amp;c. 
                        Dauid, and with teares asMat. 26. 75. 
                        Peter, pray againſt them. The reaſon why moſt ſo ſildome, ſo coldly and faintly pray againſt their ſinnes, is becauſe they neuer examine themſelues: they ſee not how vile and wretched they are, by reaſon of them.
                     
                         Againſt temptations we are to pray eſpecially, that we be not giuen ouer vnto them, and ouercome by them: but that the Lord would either deliuer vs from the temptation, or ſo aſſiſt vs therein, that it turne not to our deſtruction, but rather to our good.
                  
                  
                     §. 35. Of praying againſt puniſhments of ſinne.
                     EVill of puniſhment
is threefolde,
                     
                     1. Temporall.
                     2. Spirituall.
                     3. Eternall.
                     
                        Temporall puniſhments are all outward iudgements,2 Outward Iudgements. miſeries and plagues in this World: theſe are in themſelues effects of ſinne: from ſinne they came firſt: had man neuer tranſgreſſed, none of theſe had euer beene inflicted vpon him.Gen. 2. 17 
                        In the day thou eateſt of the tree forbidden,
thou ſhalt die the death, ſaith God to man: All temporall iudgements are fore runners of death, and appurtenances thereof, and ſo compriſed vnder it.
                     Theſe may be ſanctified, and made medicinable: and ſo they are, in and thorow Chriſts ſuffering, to Gods children: all outward afflictions are Gods phyſicke to the faithfull. Abſolutely therefore they are not to be prayed againſt, but we are to pray either to haue them remoued, or elſe ſanctified vnto vs.
                     
                        Spirituall puniſhments,3 Spirituall puniſhments of ſinne. are ſlauery vnder Satan, the World, and the fleſh, a ſeared &amp; a dead conſcience, hardneſſe of heart, blindneſſe of mind, carnall ſecurity, impenitency, infidelity, and ſuch like. Theſe are fearefull euils, and to be praied againſt, as hell it ſelfe.
                     The Eternall puniſhment of ſinne,Eternall

                         is ſuch as cannot be expreſſed: it is ſet forth by the moſt intollerable torments that bee, as the gnawing of aMat. 9. 44.

                     This euill cauſeth an irrecouerable and perpetuall ſeparation from God:Reu. 16. 9. and maketh men to blaſpheme the God of Heauen for their paines: in which reſpect it is abſolutely to be prayed againſt: for as ſinne maketh men moſt wretched, ſo this puniſhment of ſinne maketh men moſt accurſed.

Interceſſion for others. as well as to our ſelues: for in the Lords Prayer ſuch Petitions as reſpect the good of man, are ſet downe in the plurall number, Giue vs, Forgiue vs, Deliuer vs. ExpreſlyIam. 5. 16. the Apoſtle commandeth to Pray one for another.
                     
                     This is to be done in regard of

                           1. God,Reaſons. to whom prayer is made.
                           2. Our ſelues, who make it.
                           3. Thoſe for whom it is made.
                        
                     
                     1 In that wee call vpon God for others as well as for our ſelues,1. It amplifieth Gods glorie. we acknowledge him to be not onely our own Father, but alſo the common Father of others; in which reſpect Chriſt hath taught vs to ſay, Our Father: yea, thus wee acknowledge God to be that onely fountaine from whence both our ſelues and others alſo receiue all needfull bleſſings. So as this maketh much to the honour of God.
                     2 Hereby wee performe a duty of loue,2 It is a duty of loue. one of the moſt principall duties that be. This Chriſt plainly ſheweth, where he maketh it a branch of loue: for hauing ſaid,
Mat. 5. 44 
                        Loue your enemies, he addeth, Pray for them. NowRom. 13. 8. loue is a due debt which wee owe to our brother: by performing this great duty of loue, we pay a great part of our debt. Thus we ſee that it is a matter both of charity and of iuſtice: they which neglect it,1 Sam. 12. 2. ſinne.
                     3 There is no one thing wherein and whereby wee can be more beneficiall,3 It is very profitable. and doe more good to any, then in and by Prayer. Wee§. 20. heard that Prayer is profitable vnto all things, it extendeth to the good both of body and ſoule, of the temporall and eternall eſtate of others as well as of our ſelues.
                  
                  
                     §. 37. Of thoſe who pray not for others.
                     
                        Vſe 1. MOſt worthy of much blame are they who are neuer moued to pray,Such reproued as 1 Take no notice of others neceſſities. but in their owne needs and diſtreſſes: of theſe,
                     1 Some will take no notice of others neceſſities. The Church of the Iewes in her captiuity complained of ſuch, ſaying;Iam. 1. 12 
                        Haue ye no regard all ye that paſſe by this way? If themſelues be well in their owne conceits, they thinke all other ſhould be well.
                     2 Some though they take notice,2 Are not moued therewith. yet are no whit moued to any compaſſion: asLu. 10. 31, 32 the Prieſt and Leuite which came and looked on the man that lay wounded and halfe dead in the high way, but hauing no compaſſion, paſſed by on the other ſide. Such were thoſe of whom the Prophet complained, ſaying;Amos 6. 6. 
                        No man is ſorry for the affliction of Ioſeph.

Iob bringeth in thus ſpeaking,Iob 21. 15. 
                        What profit ſhould we haue, if we ſhould pray vnto the Almighty?
                     
                     The firſt ſort of theſe bewray too much ſelfeloue.

                     The third manifeſt too much diſtruſt in God, and plaine atheiſme.
                     All of them as they violate that excellent Chriſtian duty of loue,
                        1 Cor. 13. 5. which ſeeketh not her owne things onely, but deſireth and ſeeketh the good of others alſo: ſo they ſtraiten &amp; impaire the rich treaſure, and large ocean of Gods goodneſſe and mercy, which extendeth it ſelfe to all of all ſorts.

For our parts,All prouoked to afford others the help of their prayers. if faith in God and loue to our brethren abound in vs, they will make vs diligent in obſeruing the needs of others, they wil worke in vs a fellow-feeling, and moue euen the bowels of compaſſion in vs, and ſo prouoke vs to commend our brethrens diſtreſſes to him whom wee know to bee able to ſuccour them. What madeMat. 2. 3, 4 the friends of the palſie man ſo diligent in bringing him to Chriſt? or what madeMat. 15. 22. the woman of
Canaan, andMar. 9. 22, 24. the father of the lunaticke childe, ſuch importunate ſuters to Chriſt for their children? was it not their faith in Chriſt, and their loue to thoſe parties? where this duty is neglected, there is want both of faith and of loue.

                     In generall they are not to be prayed for,For whom prayer is not to be made. whom wee know our prayers cannot helpe. Theſe are

                        Why ſhould I now faſt? that which was ſaid to

(Thy daughter is dead, why diſeaſeſt thou the maſter any further,) had been to purpoſe, if Chriſt had not extraordinarily and miraculouſly raiſed her from the dead. But ſuch miracles cannot now be expected; therefore the dead are to be let alone: for throughout the whole Scripture there is not one title which ſauoreth of any ſuch matter, but rather againſt it. We reade in the Law of many ſacrifices appointed
 for all ſorts of people in all kind of diſtreſſes, but of none for the dead? So alſo of many prayers preſcribed 
 for the liuing both in the Old and New Teſtament, but of none in either for the dead. The Apoſtle (1 Theſ. 4. 13 where of 
 purpoſe he ſetteth himſelfe to direct Chriſtians how to carry themſelues toward the dead, and how to comfort themſelues in regard of their deceaſed friends,) hath not aword of Prayer for them.
                     Though theſe be negatiue arguments, yet are they not lightly to be reiected: for they plainly ſhew that prayer for the dead, is a new-found doctrine, an article inuented ſince the Prophets and Apoſtles times, without warrant of the Word now the ſpirit warneth that1 Tim. 1. 3. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

Aug. in Pſal. 36. how can it be performed in faith? i if not in faith, how can it be acceptable to God? To ſay the leaſt againſt Prayers for the dead, they muſt needs be vaine and fruitleſſe: for Gods determinate iudgement paſſeth on euery one ſo ſoone as they die:Reu. 14. 13. 
                        If they die in the Lord, bleſſed are they: if they die in their ſinnes, they are irrecouerably curſed, as is implyed in the parable of Diues being in hell,Quouſque nobis tempus conceditur recte viuamus, &amp;c. medici poſt quā aegrotus obijt ne quicquam prodeſſe poteſt. Chryſ. hom. 75. in Mat. to whom Abraham being in heauen, thus ſaith,Luk. 16. 26. 
                        They which would go frō hence to you, cannot; neither can they come from thence to vs. Herein is the prouerbe verified, Where the tree falleth, there it lyeth: for as life leaueth vs, ſo iudgement findeth vs. Prayer therefore for the ſoules of the deceaſed, is as phyſicke for the bodies of the dead.

                     AS for Purgatory (which Papiſts make to be a middle place betweene heauen and hell,Primum locum fides Catholicorum diuina authoritate regnum credit eſſe caelorum: ſecundum gehennā: tertium penitus ignoramus. immo nec eſſe inſcripturis ſanctis in veniemus Aug. contra. Pelag. hypog. lib 5. where they ſay all ſuch are as die not in mortall, but in veniall ſin, and from whence by the Prayers of the liuing they may be releaſed,) it is a meere fixion inuented of mans idle braine, and maintained to increaſe Antichriſts earthly treaſures: it is againſt the current of the Scripture, which acknowledgeth but two ſorts of people,Mat. 13. 38. 
                        Children of the kingdome, and children of the wicked, faithfull and vnfaithfull; and accordingly onely two places after this life,Luk. 16. 23. Mar. 16. 16. 
                        heauen and hell. The diſtinction likewiſe of mortall and veniall ſinne, as they vſe it, making ſome ſinnes in their owne nature, by reaſon of the ſmalneſſe of them Veniall, is againſt the Word, which ſaith indefinitiuely of ſinne (excepting no ſinne at all,)Rom. 6. 23. 
                        The wages of ſinne is death. Woe to them that after this life enter into any fire: the Scripture no where mentioneth any temporary fire after this life, butMat. 18. 8.

                        Anſw. That petition hath not any particular reſpect to any particular perſon departed, ſo as it cannot iuſtifie any particular Prayers for a particular perſon deceaſed, which is the queſtion in controuerſie. Indeed that petition reſpecteth the whole body of Chriſt, ſome of the members wherof are the Saints now dead: but it followeth not thereupon that it is a Prayer for the dead: for principally it reſpecteth the liuing, and the dead onely by conſequence. Beſides, it implyeth no altering of the eſtate of the ſoules of the dead, which is another point in queſtion.
                     
                        Obiect. 2. Many prayed for their children and friends which were dead, and had them reſtored to life.
                     
                        Anſw. 1 This is nothing to the alteration of the eſtate of the ſoules, which is the point in controuerſie.
                     2 Thoſe were extraordinary examples done by extraordinary ſpirits, and are no more exemplary then the Iſraelites paſſing through the red Sea, or Moſes, Eliahs, and Chriſts faſting forty dayes.

                     §. 41. Of vaine wiſhes for the dead.
                     NOt much vnlike is the practiſe of many ignorant and ſuperſtitious perſons among vs, who, if mention be made of any of their friends departed, vſe preſently to ſay, God be with him, the Lord be with his ſoule, or God haue mercy on his ſoule, with the like. Marke the perſons that moſt commonly vſe theſe vaine wiſhes, and you ſhall obſerue them to be ſuch ignorant and irreligious perſons as neuer pray for their friends while they are aliue: for if they knew how to pray aright for their friends, they would not make ſuch vnprofitable wiſhes for them. Wherin note their prepoſterous courſe: when true Prayer is warrantable, acceptable, honourable to God, and may be profitable to him for whom it is made, being commanded of God, and agreeable to his will, they impiouſly neglect it: but when there is no warrant to make it, no hope of doing any good by it, they ſuperſtitiouſly vſe it.
                     
                        Obiect. Marke their apology, and ye ſhall find it as fooliſh, as the thing it ſelfe is toyiſh. For if any reprooue them for it, preſently they ſay, what hurt is it?
                     
                     
                        Anſw. It is hurt enough that there is no good in it: that it is vaine and idle.Mat. 12. 36.

Is it not enough for men to let ſlip vnawares idle words, but that they muſt alſo iuſtifie idle prayers?Heb. 11. 6. All things muſt be don

                         which is the moſt excellent and heauenly action that can be performed. But theſe wiſhes cannot be in faith, becauſe they haue no warrant: nor to Gods glory, becauſe they are not agreeable to his will: nor in loue, becauſe they can bring no profit.
                     
                        Obiect. 2. Were we not better ſay, the Lord be with them, then the Diuell take them?
                     
                     
                        Anſw. Is there not a meane betwixt extreames? muſt ye needs be ſuperſtitious, or impious? ſeeing Gods determinate iudgement is paſſed vpon them, and they are come to the place of their euerlaſting abode, why leaue ye not them to their own Maſter, and pray for the liuing, who may reape good by your prayers.
                  
                  
                     §. 42. Of not praying for ſuch as ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                     2 COncerning thoſe who ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,2 Prayer not to be made for ſuch as ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                        1 Ioh. 5. 16. we haue an expreſſe inhibition, not to pray for them; and the reaſon rendred, becauſe it is a ſin vnto death: that is, (as Chriſt more plainly ſetteth it downe,)Mat. 12. 31, 32. 
                        it ſhall not be forgiuen vnto men, neither in this world, nor in the world to come. Their iudgment is as certain as if they were dead, yea and by their ſinne manifeſted to be certaine.
                     This ſinne is very hardly diſcerned: there is neede of more then any ordinary ſpirit to diſcouer it. The ground of this ſin is ſet and obſtinate malice againſt Chriſt &amp; his truth made known vnto them by the ſpirit of reuelation. The effect of it is an vniuerſal apoſtaſie, an vtter renouncing of that truth, and that with plaine blaſphemy. Now ſeeing no man can know what is the ſpirit and heart of another by an ordinary ſpirit, who ſhall iudge a man to haue committed that ſinne? The Prophets and Apoſtles could diſcerne them, as2 Tim. 4, 14 15. 
                        Paul diſcerned Alexander. Since their times we reade onely of one who by the Church hath been adiudged to haue committed that ſinne, which was Iulian called the Apoſtate.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 43. Of not praying for thoſe who are apparantly reiected.
                     3 FOr thoſe of whom God hath giuen an expreſſe charge to the contrary,3 Prayer not to be made for ſuch as are expreſly reiected. and who are expreſly and apparently reiected of God, if any pray, doe they not thwart and gaine-ſay the reuealed will of God? we reade not that Samuel prayed for Saul, after the Lord expreſly forbade him.2 Sam. 16. 1. Had Ieremiah prayed for the people, after the Lord ſaid to him,Ier. 7. 16. 
                        Thou ſhalt not pray for this people, neither lift vp cry or prayer for them, neither intreat me, for I will not heare thee; he had tranſgreſſed.
                  
                  
                     §. 44. Of iudging the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                     THough theſe two laſt reſtraints be expreſly mentioned in the Scripture, yet we muſt take heed how we iudge any, either to haue committed that ſin vnto death, or to be reiected of God: for the one there is need of an extraordinary ſpirit, for the other of extraordinary reuelation from God.
                     
                        Queſt. What if any ſhall profeſſe themſelues to bee ſuch?
                     
                        Anſw. That is no good ground for vs to iudge them to be ſuch,Al who count themſelues reiected, may not be ſo accounted. and to ceaſe to pray for them. For many weak ones in temptation will iudge themſelues to haue ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and to be reiected of God, and thereupon neither pray for themſelues, nor ſuffer others to pray for them.
                     Theſe perſons commonly haue in them great griefe of heart, for that wretched eſtate wherein they conceiue themſelues to be, or if their heart be hardned, they are greeued for that hardneſſe, they haue a longing deſire to be out of that eſtate, yea they haue a ſecret loue of God, and zeale of his glory, though they feele it not, for they cannot endure to heare any blaſpheme Gods holy Name and truth: Now theſe are euident ſignes that they neuer fell into that vnpardonable ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                     The beſt aduice which is firſt to be giuen vnto ſuch perſons, is to perſwade them that they are more vnfit to iudge of their ſpirituall eſtate, thenSigna melancholiae ſunt exiſtimatio mala, timor fine cauſa, &amp;c. et plurimum timoris eius eſt ex eis quae non timentur ſecundum conſuetudinem Auicen. lib. 3. fen. 1. tract. 4. a man deepely poſſeſſed with melancholly, of his bodily health: and that the iudgement of ſo weighty and intricate a matter, as the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt is to be referred to the iudgement and cenſure of the Church, and not of any one particular man, except he had an extraordinary ſpirit. But howſoeuer they like ſenceleſſe patients ſeeke their owne ruine: yet let vs like good phyſitions and faithfull friends be the more tender ouer them, and afford them the beſt helpe we can, both by wiſe counſell and feruent Prayer.
                     Thus much touching the negatiue, who are not to be prayed for.
                  
                  
                     §. 45. Of the perſons who are to be prayed for.
                     THe affirmatiue,For whom prayer is to be made. (who are to be prayed for,) is very generall. For (except thoſe before excepted,) all of all ſorts are to be prayed for. Indeed the Apoſtle in this Text nameth none but Saints, yet ſimply he excludeth not all other, but rather more forcibly vrgeth this duty for the Saints: as if he had ſaid, whomſoeuer ye forget, forget not any of the Saints: let them eſpecially aboue all be remembred. In effect ſo much is here implyed, as is expreſſed.
                        Gal. 6. 10. Let vs doe good vnto all men, eſpecially vnto them who are of the houſhold of Faith.
                     
                     If this place excluded all but Saints, and implyed that none but they ſhould be prayed for, it would thwart and contradict many other places of Scripture which ſhall be declared when we proue that ſuch as are not of the Church may be prayed for. Wherefore becauſe the two later ſort who ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and who are reiected of God, are not by ordinary ſpirits diſcerned, I may for an ordinary direction ſay,
                     
                        All men liuing on earth are to be praied for.
                        All in general to be prayed for. So much the Apoſtle himſelf expreſly auoucheth.1 Tim. 2. 1. For in direct termes he exhorteth that Praiers be made for almen. All I ſay, whether they be in the Church or out of it, called or not called, friends or foes, publike or priuate perſons, rich or poore, yong or old, male or female, bond or free, of what eſtate or condition ſoeuer.
                     I will giue particular proofes of theſe particulars when I declare in what order they are to be prayed for. In the meane while note theſe generall grounds and reaſons.
                     1 All are made after the ſame image of God that we are,Reaſons. all are of the ſame mould,Iſa. 58. 7. all our owne fleſh,Luke 10. 29, &amp;c. all our neighbours, and therefore as other duties of loue, ſo this which is the moſt common and generall duty of all is to be performed for all.
                     2 Beſides, for ought we know all may belong to the election of God, and ſo haue a right to the priuiledges of Gods elect.
                     
                        Obiect. Sure it is that euery one is not elected, there alwayes haue been, ſtil are, and euer ſhalbe a mixture of reprobats with the elect:Mat. 13. 38, 47. for this world is Gods field, wherin are tares as wel as wheat, a ſea wherein are bad things as wel as good. Yea ſure it is that the greater ſort are reprobates, forMat. 22. 14. 
                        few are choſen:
                        &amp; 7. 13, 14. 
                        narrow is the way that leadeth to life, and few there bee that finde it, but broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction,
                        It cannot bee ſaid of any particular man that he belongeth not to God. 
                        and many there be which goe in thereat.
                        Non eſt deſperandum de malis, ſed pro ipſis vt boni fiant ſtudioſius ſupplicandum: quia numerus ſanctorum de numero impiorum ſemper auctus eſt. Aug. in Pſal. 36.
                     
                     
                        Anſw. Though this be moſt true, yet can wee not ſay of any particular man, that he belongeth not to Gods election. If he be not now called, he may hereafter. Though he be now a wolfe, he may become a lambe, as Paul did. Wherefore to reſolue this point diſtinctly, al men ioyntly together may not be prayed for, becauſe all belong not to Gods election. Yet all men ſeuerally (except before excepted) may and muſt be prayed for. So as there is not any one excepted. There is not any Countrey, any ſort or condition of people, any one man of whom we can ſay,
he is not to be prayed for.
                     
                     
                        Obiect. The Pope of Rome is Antichriſt, and Antichriſt is branded to bee2 Theſ. 2. 3. 
                        that man of ſinne, which is, a ſonne of perdition.
                     
                     
                        Anſw. Wee may not conceiue any particular man to be Antichriſt, but rather that ſeate and State where the Pope ſitteth, or that Hierarchy, the head whereof the Pope is,Reaſon. or the ſucceſſion of Popes one after another.Judicium. charitatis non infallibilitatis.
                     
                     The ground of prayer is the iudgement of charity, and not of certenty. Now1 Cor. 13. 7. 
                        charity hopeth all things. It hopeth that they which are out of Chriſts fold, may in time bee called into it, that very perſecutors of the Goſpell may proue profeſſors of the ſame.
                     I doubt not but vpon this ground, and in the forenamed reſpect, that clauſe in our publike Leiturgy (That it may pleaſe thee to haue mercy on all men) is vſed.

1 Ioh. 4. 16. 
                        Loue: the liker any are to God, and the neerer they come to him, the more dearely ought they to be loued, and in loue to be preferred before others: accordingly in our prayers ought they to be preferred, as

                     God hath knit perſons together by thoſe outward bonds for the mutuall good one of another, that they might be more helpfull one to another. In which reſpect the Apoſtle calleth theſe bonds,Eph. 4. 16. 
                        ioynts of furniture, or bonds of miniſtration, that is, bonds whereby the ſeuerall parties that are knit together furniſh one another, by receiuing helpe one from another, and conueighing helpe one to another. Now prayer is the beſt meanes wherein and whereby we may be helpfull one to another.

                        5 Enemies. euen thoſe who hate, curſe, hurt and perſecute vs. ThisMat. 5. 44. Chriſt expreſly commanded &amp;Luke 23. 34. himſelfe alſo practiſed, for when his enemies had ſpit out the venome of their malice againſt him,Debemus optare etiam ijs per quos flagellarum vt conuertantur. Aug. in Pſ. 36. and done what hurt they could vnto him, he prayed for them, and ſaid Father forgiue them. So did his Apoſtle, both command it, and practiſe it: For to others he ſaid,Rom. 12. 14. 
                        Bleſſe them that perſecute you. Of himſelfe he ſaid,1 Cor. 4. 13. 
                        We are euill ſpoken of, and we pray. While the enemies of Stephen were throwing ſtones at him as thicke as haile ſtones,Act. 7. 60. 
                        Hee kneeled downe and cryed with a loude voice, Lord lay not this ſinne to their charge.

                        ouercome euill with goodneſſe. The Scribes and Phariſes which followed the principles of nature, taughtMat. 5. 43. 
                        to hate enemies. So did the heathen in their beſt moral Philoſophy. Chriſtians onely &amp; thoſe true and ſound Chriſtians can attaine to his extent of loue: it is impoſſible for a natural man to loue his enemie truly and intirely: none euer did, or can doe it, but thoſe who haue the ſpirit of Chriſt in them.
                  
                  
                     §. 52. Of mens failing in praying for others.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         IF in theſe points of praying for others we obſerue how farre moſt goe,
 we ſhall find how exceedingly moſt faile therein, and come ſhort of their dutie.
                     1 Not onely Atheiſts, but euen few of thoſe that beare the title of calling vpon God,
                        Few pray for their enemies come to this extent of loue to pray for their enemies. Many can pray for their friends, but who for their enemies? I doubt not but many finding this point ſo clearely and euidently laid downe in the Scriptures, are perſwaded that it is a duty, and thereupon ſometimes when their blood is colde, and the wrongs of their enemies ſomewhat out of their minds, can ſay God forgiue them: or for forme and cuſtome ſake, when they heare the Miniſter vtter this clauſe of the Letany, That it may pleaſe thee to forgiue our enemies, perſecuters, and ſlanderers, and to turne their hearts, can anſwer;
We beſeech thee to heare vs good Lord: but from the heart to pray for them euen when they wrong vs, or while their iniuries are freſh in our memories (asLuke 23. 34 Chriſt andAct. 7. 60. 
                        Stephen did) is a rare matter, ſo rare as few attaine vnto it: witneſſe that proneneſſe which is in the beſt (if not openly to curſe, and vſe fearefull imprecations as the worſer ſort doe, yet) inwardly to wiſh, and imagine many euils againſt them. This deſire of reuenge being one of the luſts of the fleſh, we muſt labour to maintaine a contrary luſt of the ſpirit, which is to loue our enemies, and pray for them: forGal 5. 17. 
                        The ſpirit luſteth againſt the fleſh. If we be led by the ſpirit, we ſhal not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh.
                     2 If it be a breach of loue not to pray for our enemies,Many pray for none that are ſtrangers to them. how great a fault is it to refuſe, or forget to pray for thoſe who neuer hurt vs, becauſe they are ſtrangers, vnknowne, and (as men thinke) they no whit beholding vnto them? Is this for Gods ſake, Chriſts ſake, conſcience ſake, and loue ſake, without reſpect of perſons to performe this duty? If ſuch knew the benefit of Prayer, they would bee glad to pertake of the benefit of their prayers who neuer knew them. Is it not then good reaſon that ſtrangers whom they neuer knew ſhould alſ. pertake of the benefit of their Prayers?Some pray not for thoſe to whom they are bound.
                     
                     3 If to forget ſtrangers be ſuch a fault, how monſtrous, inhumane, and vnnaturall a thing is it, to negle
                           •
                        
                         this maine duty of loue, wherein we may doe ſo much good, and not performe it for thoſe to whom wee are bound by particular and peculiar bonds? not onely ſome kinsfolke afarre off, countrey-men, fellow-citizens, townes-men, pariſhioners, neighbours, friends, and ſuch like, but many which are very neere of blood, of one and the ſame family, bedfellowes, with the like, neuer pray one for another. Not husbands and wiues, parents and children, brothers and ſiſters, with the like: many Parents other wiſe prouident for their children, faile in this maine point, whereby it commeth to paſſe that their prouidence faileth of the iſſue deſired and expected.1 Tim 5. 8. The Apoſtle ſaith▪ 
                        If there be any that prouideth not for his owne, he denyeth the faith and is worſe then an Infidel. What is he then that prayeth not for his owne? ſhall not Diues riſe vp in iudgement againſt ſuch,Luke 16. 27, 28. who being in hell prayed that Lazarus might goe to his fathers houſe, and to his brethren to teſtifie vnto them, leſt they alſo ſhould come into that place of torment?
                     4 The very heathen could ſay that a mans countrey is to be preferred before his family,Some forget their Magiſtrates, and Miniſters. publike perſons before priuate, yet many who profeſſe themſelues Chriſtians, are very vnmindfull of the Church and Commonwealth where they liue, neuer calling vpon God for Miniſters and Magiſtrates. May we not well thinke that this is one cauſe why there are ſo few good, why ſuch corruptions in both? aſſuredly if God were faithfully, earneſtly, inſtantly called vpon, we ſhould haue more ſtore of better.
                     5 In the laſt place what may we thinke of thoſe who pray not for the Saints,Some pray not for Saints all of whom aboue al other ought to be prayed for? can the loue of God be in ſuch? But then what of ſuch, as are ſo farre from praying for any of them as they curſe them,Some curſe them. &amp; wiſh all euill againſt them, in this reſpect, becauſe they are Saints and vpright in heart? there be husbands that curſe ſuch wiues: parents, ſuch children: maiſters, ſuch ſeruants: Magiſtrates, ſuch ſubiects: Miniſters, ſuch people: and ſo on the other ſide, wiues ſuch husbands, children ſuch parents, &amp;c. So alſo brothers ſuch brothers, kinſmen ſuch kinſmen, neighbours ſuch neighbours, &amp;c. Well may wee thinke that they who thus hate whom God loueth, and curſe whom God bleſſeth, are neither loued of God, nor ſhall receiue bleſſing from him, vnleſſe they thorowly repent. The Apoſtle ſaith, pray for all Saints, among Saints excluding none at all▪ they curſe all Saints, euen thoſe that are by outward bonds neereſt knit vnto them. This their bitter ſpite againſt Saints, whom otherwiſe they could loue, if they wee not Saints, argueth that they haue no part or fellowſhip in the body of Chriſt, nor in other priuiledges of the Saints.
                  
                  
                     §. 53 Of the things which we are to pray for in the behalfe of others.
                     FOr the things which wee are to aske in praier for others, in generall they are whatſoeuer we may aske for our ſelues: for proofe whereof obſerue the forme of the Lords praier: in euery petition, where we aske any thing for our ſelues, we include others: we aske bread for others,
giue vs our daily bread: ſo likewiſe forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, freedome from temptation, and deliuerance from euill. Here therefore I might runne ouer againe al thoſe particular points which were before deliuered concerning good things, whether temporall, ſpirituall, or eternall, to be praied for, and euill things whether euill of fault, or euill of puniſhment to be prayed againſt, and apply them to prayers made for others: but that heedeth not; onely here obſerue this generall rule, that according to the needes of others, are prayers to be made for them.
                     
                     1 If they be not called,Ideo de terra erectus eſt Paulus, quia in terra inclinatus exauditus eſt Stephanus. Aug. ſer. 4 de Stephan. pray that they may be conuerted: no doubt but Chriſts prayer on the croſſe was the cauſe that ſo many Iewes after his death were conuerted. The like may be ſaid of Steuens praier.
                     2 If they be called, pray that they may be eſtabliſhed, and grow in grace, asCol. 1. 9. Saint Paul did.
                     3 If they haue ſinned,Iam. 5. 15. pray that their ſinnes may be forgiuen.
                     4 If they be ſicke,Iam. 5. 15. pray that they may be raiſed.
                     5 If they be wrongfully impriſoned,Heb. 13. 18. 19. that they may be deliuered, and ſo according to other needs.
                  
                  
                     §. 54. This Gods will not knowne, is no ſufficient cauſe to hinder praier for others.
                     
                        Obiect. THus may wee croſſe Gods determined purpoſe, by praying for thoſe things which God doth not purpoſe to grant: as to pray for a mans life, when his time of departure is come.
                     
                        Anſw. 1. The ſame might be obiected againſt praier for our ſelues: and then what praier ſhould be made?
                     2 Gods reuealed will is the rule and ground of our praiers: we are not to ſearch into his ſecret counſell: but whatſoeuer we find warranted in the word, to pray for.
                     3 In all praiers for others, we muſt pray with limitation, and ſubiection to Gods will: there is nothing for which we can pray ſo abſolutely in the behalfe of others, as in our owne behalfe: for we cannot know the eſtate of others, ſo well as of our ſelues;
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 55. Of imprecations againſt ones ſelfe.
                     THe fourth and laſt branch of Prayer is Expoſtulation,
                        IIII. Kind. Imprecation. or Imprecation againſt others, which is a kind of Prayer whereby iudgement and vengeance is deſired.
                     In handling this point, I will ſhew,
                     1 What the perſons be againſt whom imprecations may be made.
                     2 In what reſpect they may be made.
                     For the perſons,
                        No man muſt pray againſt himſelfe. No man may pray againſt himſelfe: we haue no warrant in all the Scripture for it, and therefore it muſt needs be a matter of impiety: beſides it is againſt very nature it ſelfe, forEph. 5. 29. 
                        No man euer yet hated himſelfe, and therefore it muſt needs be matter of iniquitie and iniurie.
                     
                        Obiect. Many of the Saints haue made imprecations againſt themſelues, as2 Sam. 3. 35 
                        Dauid, Salomon, and other, who in their oathes vſed theſe and ſuch like words,1 Kin. 2. 23. 
                        God doe ſo to me, and more alſo.
                     
                     
                        Anſw. 1. When an oath is taken inIer. 4. 2. 
                        truth, not falſly, in iudgement, not raſhly, in righteouſneſſe, not wrongfully, the imprecation expreſſed or implyed therein, is not ſimply made, as if he that tooke the oath deſired any ſuch thing to fall vpon himſelfe, but vſed onely for a more vehement teſtification of the truth to moue the hearer the rather to giue credence thereunto; or elſe to binde him that ſweareth the more ſtedfaſtly to performe his oath.
                     2 If any of the Saints haue vſed imprecations in an oath falſely, asMat. 26. 74 
                        Peter▪
                         or raſhly, asIoſ. 9. 14. 15. the Princes in Ioſhuahs time, or wrongfully, as1 Sam. 25. 22 
                        Dauid; their examples are no good warrant.
                     
                        Obiect. 2. A wife ſuſpected by her husband,Num. 5. 22. expounded. was bound by the Law to make imprecations againſt herſelfe.
                     
                        Anſw. She was not bound to doe ſo. For if ſhe were free of the crime laid to her charge, that imprecation wa
                           •
                         no imprecation: but if ſhe were guilty, then ſhe ought to acknowledge her fault, and not curſe her ſelfe. If being guilty, ſhe aſſented to that imprecation, it was her owne fault and not the bond of the Law.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         
                        Vſe. How impious are they againſt God,
 how iniurious againſt their owne ſoules,Reproofe of vſuall imprecations againſt ones ſelfe. who vpon euery light occaſion, yea and that many times falſly (for common raſh ſwearers are oftentimes falſeſwearers,) do imprecate direfull vengeance againſt themſelues, as, I would I might neuer ſtir, I would I might neuer eat bread more, I would I might die preſently, I would I might be ſwallowed vp quicke, I would I might be damned. Oh fearefull
                           •
                         the Iewes of ancient time were ſo fearefull of vttering imprecations, that when in their oathes they had occaſion to vſe them, they would either expreſſe them in generall termes, thus,2 Sam. 3 35. 
                        God doe ſo to me, and more alſo: or elſe leaue them cleane out, &amp; make the ſentence imperfect, as, if I do this or if I do not that, or
if this be ſo, and there ſtay. ThusPſal. 13. 2, 3, 4. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         
                        Dauid, If I enter into the Tabernacle of mine houſe: If I goe vp into my bedde; If I giue ſleepe to mine eyes: And thus Zedekiah vnto the Prophet
Ieremiah:
                        ler. 3. 8. 16. 
                        As the Lord liueth which made vs this ſoule: if I put thee to death, If I giue thee into the hand of theſe men that ſeeke thy life. Yea thus God himſelfe,Pſal. 89. 35. 
                        I haue ſworne, if I lie vnto Dauid. And againe,&amp; 95. 11. 
                        I ſweare in my wrath if they ſhall enter into my reſt. To ſhew that this is the right tranſlation of that forme of ſpeech,Heb. 3. 11. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . the Apoſtle alleadging that forme of Gods oath ſo tranſlateth it. What doth this teach vs, but that we ſhould be very fearefull to vtter any imprecation againſt our ſelues, eſpecially to doe it falſly or raſhly? the Iewes, which cauſed Chriſt to be crucified, and their poſterity to this day haue felt the woe and curſe of that imprecation which they made againſt themſelues, when they ſaid to Pilat of Chriſt,Mat. 27. 25. 
                        His bloud be vpon vs and our children: So hath God cauſed the vengeance of many others imprecations to fal vpon their owne neckes, and that in iuſt iudgement.
                  
                  
                     §. 56. Of the perſons againſt whom imprecation may be made.
                     WHerefore lawful &amp; warrantable imprecations,Imprecations againſt publike and deſperate enemies. are to be made againſt others, &amp; thoſe other to be enemies (enemies I ſay, not our owne priuate enemies in particular cauſes, betwixt vs and them: for theſe muſt be prayed for, as we heard§. 51. before, but publike) ſuch as are enemies to God, his Church and Goſpel, yea alſo obſtinate, deſperate, reprobate enemies, who neither will nor can bee reclaimed: as were Corah, Dathan, &amp; Abiram,
                        Numb. 16. 15 againſt whom
Moſes prayed. Such were thoſe againſt whom Dauid ſo earneſtly praied, Pſal. 109. 67, &amp;c. andGal. 5. 12. whom S. Paul wiſhed to be cut off. Such an one was Alexander concerning whom S. Paul thus prayed,2 Tim. 4. 14. 
                        The Lord reward him according to his works, meaning his euill works.
                     1. Quest. How can ſuch be diſcerned?
                     
                        Anſw. By an ordinary ſpirit they cannot be diſcerned, but onely by an extraordinary ſpirit, euen ſuch a ſpirit as the Prophets and Apoſtles had, to whom God by his ſpirit reuealed what ſuch and ſuch perſons were againſt whom they prayed. Wherefore when the Diſciples would haue cauſed fire to come downe from heauen and conſume the Samaritans,Luk. 9. 54, 55. Chriſt ſaid vnto them, Ye know not of what ſpirit ye are.
                     
                     2 Quest. How then may ordinary perſons make imprecations againſt any?
                     
                        
                        Anſ. No ordinary man can lawfully make any imprecation againſt the perſons of any particular diſtinct men:Imprecations may bee made in three reſpects. Only in theſe three reſpects may imprecations be made.
                     1.1 Indefinitely. Indefinitely, againſt all ſuch publike deſparate enemies as were noted before, without any application of the imprecation to any particular perſons, no not ſo much as in thought: and thus was that general imprecation vſed when the Arke went forward,Num. 10. 35. 
                        Riſe vp Lord, and let thine enemies be ſcattered. And thus Dauid vſeth many generall imprecations, asPſal. 25. 3. 
                        Let them bee confounded which tranſgreſſe without cauſe.
                        &amp; 122. 5.

                     Of him and all other which vniuſtly and vnchriſtianly vſe ſuch fearefull imprecations, if in time they repent not, I may vſe the words of Dauid.

                     §. 59. Of Thankeſgiuing.
                     OVr Apoſtle giueth an excellent directiō for thankſgiuing, in the twentieth verſe of the fifth Chapter of this Epiſtle, which becauſe it is ſo fit for our preſent purpoſe, I will here handle. His words are theſe,
                     
                        Epheſ. 5. 20. Giue thankes alwaies for all things vnto God, euen the Father, in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                     IN this direction are laid downe fiue particular points.
                     1 The duty it felfe, giue thankes.
                     
                     2 The perſon to whom it is to be performed, to God, euen the Father.
                     
                     3 The Mediator, in whoſe name it is to be performed,
in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                     
                     4 The matter of thankeſgiuing, all things.
                     
                     5 The continuance thereof, alwaies.
                     
                     1 For the duty or thing it ſelfe,What thankſgiuing is. 
                        Thankeſgiuing is a gratefull acknowledgement of a kindneſſe receiued.
                     
                     A kindneſſe done, is the obiect of thankeſgiuing, yet vnleſſe the kindneſſe done be accepted, and withall acknowledged to be a kindneſſe, the heart of him to whom the kindneſſe is done, will not bee affected to giue him that did it, thankes for it.
                     
                        1 Sam. 25. 5, &amp;c. 
                        Dauid did a great kindneſſe for Nabal, as Nabals ſeruants could teſtifie: yet Nabal acknowledged it to be no kindneſſe; and that made him to be ſo churliſh and vngratefull to Dauid.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 60. Of the perſon to whom all thankes is due.
                     2 THe perſon to whom thankes is due,Thankes is to be giuen to God. is God the Father. Father hath reference eſpecially vnto the onely begotten ſon of God Chriſt Ieſus, as is more plainly expreſſed in theſe words,Eph. 1. 3. 
                        Bleſſed be God euen the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. So as this clauſe doth note out the
firſt perſon in Trinity: yet doth it not exclude the other two perſons: for thankſgiuing belongeth to the whole
Trinity. S. Paul expreſly giueth thankes to1 Tim. 1. 12. 
                        Ieſus Chriſt: and yet excludeth not the Father or the holy Ghoſt: for what honour or worſhip ſoeuer is rightly performed to either of the perſons, is alſo performed to euery of them. But here &amp; in many other places, this title Father (which is propper to the firſt perſon) is added, to ſhew how our prayſes come to be acceptable vnto God, namely as God is the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and in him our gracious and louing Father.
                     
                        Iam. 1. 17. Saint Iames rendreth a weighty reaſon to proue that
all thankes is to be giuen to God,Reaſon. &amp; to God alone, for ſaith he, euery good giuing and euery perfect gift commeth from the Father. Good things come from God, God is the author &amp; giuer of them; God therefore is to be praiſed for them.
                     
                        Euery good thing commeth from God: therefore all praiſe is due to him.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 61. Of the difference of thanks giuen to God and men.
                     
                        Quest. ARe not Creatures to bee thanked for any kindneſſe done by them?
                     
                        Anſw. Not in that manner as God is to bee thanked. God is ſimply, in and for himſelfe to be prayſed.
                     
                     
                        Simply, that is without any reſtraint, with all our heart, with all our ſoule, and with all our might, and that for all his workes whatſoeuer.
                     
                        
                        In and for himſelfe, that is, in reſpect of no other whatſoeuer: For God is the very fountaine, the firſt and onely Author, the principall giuer of the good things we enioy. The things which we receiue by the miniſtry of any creature, originally we receiue from God. Creatures are but the Stewards, Meſſengers, Miniſters, and as it were Carriers of God: they bring Gods bleſſings one to another. Wherefore they are not ſimply in and for themſelues to be thanked for any thing. The thankes which is giuen to them (if it be rightly giuen) is giuen them in the Lord, vnder him, onely for their paines &amp; care in bringing Gods bleſſings vnto vs.Simile. When a perſonage of great ſtate and place ſendeth a preſent by his ſeruant, will he to whom that preſent is ſent, thanke the ſeruant that brought it, or the Maſter that ſent it? Surely I ſuppoſe he will both deſire the ſeruant to thanke his Maſter, and alſo when he hath opportunity himſelfe, thanke him: if he thanke the bearer, it is onely for his paines in bringing the gift, not for the gift it ſelfe: yea, though he reward the meſſenger for his paines, yet he giueth the thankes to him that ſent the gift. Thus is thankes properly due to the originall author of a kindneſſe: all thankes therefore is properly due to God, from whom euery good thing commeth.
                  
                  
                     §. 62. Of the Mediator, in whoſe name thankes is to be giuen.
                     3 THe Mediator,
                        3 Thankes to be rendred to God in the mediation of Chriſt. in whoſe name thankes is to be giuen to God, is intituled by the Apoſtle, Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                     
                     The firſt title Lord, implieth thatMat. 28. 18. power and regiment which the Father hath giuen him (as he is Mediator Godman) ouer all creatures. This regiment he exerciſeth for the good of vs who are of his Church, and therefore by a kind of propriety he is called OVr Lord.
                     The ſecond title IESVS, which ſignifieth a Sauiour, ſetteth forth that all-ſufficient, full, and perfect redemption and ſaluation, which he wrought for mankind. The reaſon of this name and title is rendered by an Angell vnto Ioſeph, in theſe words;Mat. 1. 21. 
                        Thou ſhalt call his name IESVS, for he ſhall ſaue his people from their ſinnes.
                     
                     The third title CHRIST, (which ſignifieth Annointed) implies the three Offices of Christ, whereunto he was annointed, and ſet a part of his Father: his Princely Office to gouerne and protect his Church; his Prieſtly Office, to offer himſelfe a ſacrifice, and to make continuall interceſſion for his Church. His Propheticall Office to inſtruct, and direct his Church in the way of Saluation.
                     In the name of this Our Lord Ieſus Crhiſt, muſt all the calues of our lippes, all our praiſes be offered vp vnto God.Heb. 13. 15. 
                        Let vs by him (ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of Chriſt Ieſus) offer the ſacrifice of praiſe. This point was before handled in the generall doctrine of Prayer.

So that whatſoeuer the Lord doth, affordeth matter of praiſe to the Saints. Oft is this generall particle all vſed in this point;1 Theſ 5 18

                        Wee know that all things worke together for good to them that loue God:
                        Reaſon, If all things worke to our good, is it not iuſt and meete that thankes ſhould be giuen for all things.
                     
                     That wee may ſomewhat more diſtinctly diſcerne the matter of thankſgiuing, I will ſet downe in order ſome particular branches of this generall point.
                     
                         The matter of Thankeſgiuing may ſundry wayes be diſtinguiſhed.

                     1 The ground of them, which is Election. Together with which we are to reckon the cauſe thereof, Gods free grace and rich mercy, and alſo the fruit thereof, certenty of ſaluation.
                     
                     2 The meritorious cauſe of them; namely, our Redemption, vnder which wee muſt compriſe, the price of our redemption,
Chriſts blood, and the ſpeciall fruits thereof, as
Reconciliation, Adoption, Remisſion of ſinnes, imputation of righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.

peace of conſcience, ioy in the ſpirit, holy ſecurity, with the like.
                     Finally the meanes which the Spirit vſeth to worke, and encreaſe all theſe graces, are to be remembred, which are the Miniſtery of the Word, Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and other holy Ordinances of God, together with liberty of the Sabbaths, of good and faithfull Miniſters, of publike Aſſemblies, with the like.
                     Thoſe eternall bleſſings which are in Heauen reſerued for vs,2 Eternall bleſſings. are ſuch, as Eye hath not ſeene, nor eare heard, nor haue entred into the heart of man.

The remouing of theſe is matter of thankſgiuing.
                  
                  
                     §. 67. Of giuing thanks for croſſes.
                     YEt are not outward temporall iudgements,Temporall iudgements not alwaies to be accounted euils. whether publike or priuate, alwaies to be ſimply accounted euils, but many times to bee reckoned and accounted in the number of Gods bleſſings. ForHeb. 12. 5, 6, 7, &amp;c. 
                        God oft inflicteth them on his children, and that in loue, for their good. They are indeede grieuous, and irkſome to the fleſh, but many times profitable to the ſoule: an heauie burthen they are, but they bring forth a good &amp; precious fruit: wherefore in regard of them, we muſt wholy refer our ſelues to Gods will, asMat. 26. 39. Chriſt did in his bitter agonie. If God bee pleaſed to preſerue vs from them, or being fallen vpon vs, to remoue them, we are to account this preſeruation and deliuerance,Outward croſſes are matter of thankſgiuing. a bleſſing and fauor of the Lord, and to be thankfull vnto God for it. But otherwiſe if it pleaſe the Lord to lay any croſſe vpon vs, or when it lieth on vs, ſtil to cōtinue it, we are alſo to take this as a token of loue, and to be thankfull. The reaſon is euident. For God being very wiſe, &amp; knowing what is beſt for vs (euen much better then we our ſelues) &amp; withall being a louing &amp; tender father,Non tantum pro his quae bona putamus, ſed etiam quae nos coartant in Dei praeconium mens laeta prorumpat. Hieron. in Eph. 5. exceeding carefull of our good, he doth ſo diſpoſe our eſtate, as may moſt make to our good. When he ſeeth it to be needefull, he laieth affliction vpon vs: when it hath lien long enough vpon vs, then he rem oueth it. In this kinde he dealeth with his children, as skilfull and tender Phyſitians or Chirurgians doe with their patients, whoſe cure they ſeeke. Now therefore vpon this ground, we are to thinke euery eſtate whereunto the Lord bringeth vs to be the beſt for vs: health to be the beſt when wee are in health, and ſickneſſe to be beſt, when we are ſicke: aboundance to be beſt while we haue it, and want to bee beſt when we are in want, and ſo of other eſtates. Therefore when the Lord doth lay vpon vs any outward afflictions, wee muſt put them on the ſcore of Gods fauours: eſpecially the good fruites of afflictions, as true humiliation, ſound repentance, chriſtian watchfulneſſe, righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. Now then to conclude this point, afflictions being tokens of Gods loue, tending to the good of the Saints, they are compriſed vnder this general clauſe ALL THINGS, and are matter of thankſgiuing.

                           •
                        y for good things promiſed and not inioyed,
Heb. 11. 13. it is noted that the Patriarches receiued not the promiſes, but ſaw them a farre off, and beleeued them, and receiued them thankfully.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 69. Of the abundant matter of thankſgiuing.
                     HEre we ſee what abundant matter of thankſgiuing is offered vnto vs. If we ſhould ſpend our whole time (as the triumphant Church in heauen doth) in lauding &amp; praiſing God, wee could not want matter, conſidering that ALL THINGS are matter of thankſgiuing.
                     If I ſhould ſay we haue more matter of thankſgiuing then of petition,More matter of thankſgiuing then of petition. I ſhould not ſpeake amiſſe: for the bleſſings which any of Gods children, any of thoſe who truly beleeue in Chriſt, haue receiued already, are much more, and farre greater then the things which they want. God hath long ſince elected and choſen them to bee veſſels of mercy &amp; glory: when he created man, as he made man moſt happy, according to the image of God, ſo before he made man he created all things needefull for him, that ſo he might be deſtitute of no good thing: for he made heauen and the whole hoaſt thereof, earth and all the fruites of it, yea the aire and water and all creatures in them; in a word God made all things that were made, for the good of man. The price of mans redemption is already paid: All true beleeuers are reconciled to God, adopted to bee his children, made actuall members of Chriſts body, effectually called, and taken into the kingdome of grace, being perfectly iuſtified euen in Gods ſight by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus. What are the ſpirituall bleſſings which wee want, that may bee comparable to theſe which we haue receiued?
                     
                        Obiect. 1. We haue not receiued freedome from, and full victory ouer all ſinne.
                     
                        Anſw.
                        How farre we are freed from ſinne. Sinne hath receiued a deadly wound: though it aſſaile vs, yet ſhall it not get conqueſt ouer vs. Beſides the guilt &amp; puniſhment of thoſe very ſins, which yet we are ſubiect vnto, ſhall not be laid vpon vs: they are cleane remitted, and in that reſpect we fully acquitted.
                     
                        Obiect. 2. Wee want many good and comfortable graces, and faile in the meaſure of thoſe we haue: our ſanctification is not perfect.
                     
                        Anſw.
                        How far ſanctified. All the faithfull haue al ſuch graces as are abſolutely neceſſary vnto ſaluation, actually wrought in them. As a childe borne of a woman hath all the parts of ſoule and body, ſo he that is borne againe of God hath al the parts of a new man. No Saint wanteth any grace that may hinder his ſaluation, though he ſhould inſtantly die. As for that meaſure which ſome want, it is not ſo great as can iuſtly impeach the truth of grace: that grace which they haue is true, though it may bee weake: and their ſanctification is ſound, though imperfect. The perfecting of ſanctification is not ſo great and powerfull a worke, as the firſt beginning of it. The moſt effectuall &amp; powerfull worke of Gods ſpirit in the faithfull, is their very new birth, the firſt act of their conuerſion. For when a ſinner is firſt conuerted, he is a new created: of nothing (I ſpeake in regard of of our ſpirituall being) he is made ſomething: of a man dead in ſin, he is quickned, &amp; hath ſpiritual life put into him. Now the growth in ſanctification, is but a proceeding from one degree to another in the ſame kinde: yea the very perfection of ſanctification is but an attaining to the higheſt ſtep &amp; degree of that which was begun before. It is therfore a more powerfull worke to beget a ſinner to God, and to worke his firſt conuerſion, then after he is regenerate and conuerted to perfect that good worke which is begunne. Whence it followeth that faithfull Saints haue more matter of reioycing for the grace they haue receiued, then of mourning for the grace they want.
                     
                        Obiect. Wee want the poſſeſſion of our heauenly inheritance.
                     
                        Anſw.
                        How farre we are made partakers of heauen. 1. The purchaſe of it is made: for Chriſt by his bloud hath purchaſed it.
                     2 Wee haue receiued the firſt fruites of it, as peace of conſcience, ioy in the holy Ghoſt, free entrance vnto the throne of grace and glory, with confidence in Chriſt and the like.
                     3 We are actually entred into the kingdom of grace, which is a part of the kingdom of glory, the firſt ſtep thereinto, and the portall (as I may ſo ſay) thereof: no entring into the kingdom of glory, but thorow the kingdom of grace.
                     4 Wee haue the earneſt of the ſpirit, as a pledge and pawne till wee come to the full poſſeſſion of the purchaſed inheritance.
                     5 Chriſt our head hath full and actuall poſſesſion thereof:Ephe. 2. 6. whereupon wee being members of his body, are in him exalted, and ſet in heauenly places.
                     
                     In theſe fine forenamed reſpects we may truely ſay that the faithfull in Chriſt haue more cauſe to glorifie God for that aſſurance they haue of inioying their heauenly inheritance, then to murmure or mourne that for a time

                           •
                        hey want the full poſſeſſion of it. Thus we ſee that in re
                        
                           •
                        ard of ſpiritual blesſings, we haue more matter of praiſe

                           •
                        or that wee haue, then of petition for that wee want. I might here further ranke among theſe ſpirituall bleſſings, the liberty of the Lords Sabbaths, of the Miniſtry of his word, and adminiſtration of his Sacraments, of the publike aſſemblies of Saints to worſhip God, with the like, which we among others plentifully inioy: I migh alſo further declare how God hath already cauſed his whole wil to be reuealed, and recorded in his word, ſo far forth as is needful for our ſaluation, &amp; expedient for vs to know: all which do much amplifie the forenamed point: But I haſten to ſet foorth a view alſo of ſome of thoſe temporall bleſſings whereof we haue been, and are made pertakers. They are exceeding many, as our Being, Life, Nouriſhment, Education, Health, Strength, Food, Apparrell, Goods, Friends, &amp;c. Gods bleſſing on all theſe, and on the Church and ſtate wherein we liue. Whether-ſoeuer we turn our ſelues, or caſt our eies, either vpwards to the heauens, and the whole hoaſt of them, or downeward on the earth, and all the fruits thereof: or vp and downe on all the creatures in the aire, on the earth, and in the waters, on the right hand or on the left, before or behinde, euery where the bleſſings of God doe preſent themſelues to our view and conſideration. By this which hath thus generally been ſpoken, I doubt not but any of meane capacitie may obſerue that none of the Saints doe want ſo many good things as they haue receiued.
                     
                        Obiect. Many of the Saints doe want euen neceſſaries to preſerue this temporall life,Luk. 16. 21. as Lazarus.
                     
                     
                        Anſw.
                        Why many Saints want outward things. 1. God ſeeth it to bee good for them to want ſuch neceſſaries.
                     2 Inſteed of theſe outward neceſſaries, they haue inward graces which are much more valuable &amp; profitable as inſteed of of outward refreſhing of the body, they haue inward comfort of the ſoule: inſteed of outward ornaments of the body, inward graces of the ſpirit: wanting outward eaſe, they haue ſweet peace of conſcience: wanting plenty, they haue contentment: In a word, God depriueth his children of no outward thing, but he ſupplieth the want of it with ſome ſpirituall recompence: their want therefore cauſeth matter of thankſgiuing.
                     As all the Saints haue receiued more good things then they want,Saints are freed from more euils then ſhal euer fal vpon them againe. ſo alſo vndoubtedly are they freed from more euils then iuſtly they can feare to fall vpon them. For beleeuing in Chriſt, they are freed from the feare of hell, from the curſe of the Law, from the wrath of God, from the ſting of death, from the victory of the graue, from the power of him that hath the power of death, the diuel; from the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne, from the rule and dominion of ſinne, and from infinitely more, both ſpirituall, and bodily euils.
                     
                        Obiect. Many Saints are ſubiect both to many ſpirituall euils, (as trouble of minde, doubt of Gods fauour, ſnares of the Diuell, fallings into ſinne, with the like,) and alſo to many temporall diſtreſſes, as paine, ſickneſſe, captiuity, impriſonment, ignominy, penury, &amp;c.
                     
                        Anſw.
                        How ſpiritual euils may proue matter of thankeſgiuing. Thoſe ſpirituall euils are as deſperate phyſicke for the cure of ſome ſpirituall deſperate diſeaſe, as ſpirituall ſecurity, pride, preſumption, &amp;c. Now who will denie but that it is good in a deſperate caſe to vſe a deſperate remedy? If the remedy cauſe recouery, he that vſeth it ſhall be commended, and rewarded? But whenſoeuer God ſuffereth any of his children to fall into any of the forenamed, or other like ſpirituall euils, hee worketh thereby a recouery from ſome more dangerous and deſperate euill: therefore the iſſue and effect euen of thoſe euils affordeth matter of thankſgiuing.
                     As for temporall diſtreſſes, I haue ſhewed§. 67. before how they may be put on the ſcore of Gods bleſſings. To that which was before deliuered,2. Cor. 4. 16. Chriſtianorum propria virtus eſt, etiam in iis quae aduerſa putantur referre gratias Creatori. Hier. in Ephe. 5. let me ad this, that God doth alwaies ſo diſpoſe of the eſtat of the Saints, that he maketh the decaying of the outward man to be a renewing of the inner man. In theſe reſpects it is a vertue propper to Chriſtians, to giue thankes to God for ſuch things as ſeeme euill.
                     Beſides,Promiſe of ſupplying all our wants. God hath faithfully promiſed to ſupply in due time whatſoeuer his Saints want, and to perfect euery thing that faileth in perfection, &amp; withall to deliuer them from all euill. Now then adde theſe promiſes (which are alſo matter of thankſgiuing) to the abundance of good things which already we haue receiued, and to the manifold deliuerances which wee haue had from euils, and it wil appeare as cleare as the light, that of all duties belonging to faithfull Chriſtians this of praiſe and thankſgiuing is moſt beſeeming them, and leaſt of all to bee neglected: It is the leaſt that God deſerueth, the moſt that he requireth, and the beſt that we can giue vnto him: the beſt ſacrifice in the kinde thereof which wee can offer vnto God, and that which God doth beſt accept: for note what God ſaith hereof,Pſal. 50. 23. 22. 
                        He that offereth praiſe, glorifieth me. I might much further amplifie and inlarge theſe points. But as Painters, when they haue many millions, and armies of men to ſet down in a ſmall mappe,Simile. vſe onely to draw out ſome number of heads of men and ſet them together, leauing the whole number of heads, and all the other parts and liniaments to the meditation of the beholder: euen ſo am I conſtrained thorow abundance of matter to propound onely ſome general heads of this point of thankſgiuing and to leaue the amplification of them to your priuate meditation.

Yet either thus blind are many, or elſe (which is worſe) they ſee, and will not ſee: they know there is abundant matter of thankſgiuing, &amp; yet will take no notice of any at all. Are not almoſt all much more ready to craue and aske, then to giue thanks? I ſpeake not th

Marke &amp; obſerue if their requeſts to God be not more frequent &amp; feruent then their thankſgiuing. If trouble of minde or body, if any inward or outward diſtres ſeaſe vpon men, if they feare any ſpirituall or temporall danger hanging ouer their heads, how inſtant and conſtant wil they be in intreating the Lord to remoue his heauy hand?

                     §. 71. Of Mens failing in the extent of Thankſgiuing.
                     BVt to let paſſe thoſe alſo that offend in the generall neglect of this duty: there are other who being ſomewhat carefull of the duty in generall,1 Some are not thankfull for ſpirituall bleſſings. faile exceedingly in the extent of it: they giue not thankes for AL THINGS. Some can be thankefull for temporall bleſſings, as for
peace, plenty, ſeaſonable weather, deliuerance from inuaſions, rebellions, treaſons, from fire, plagues, famine, ſickneſſe, &amp;c. But it ſeemeth they take no notice of ſpirituall bleſſings: their mouthes are very ſeldome or neuer opened to bleſſe God for them. They ſhew themſelues to be too earthly minded.
                     Other can be thankfull for priuate bleſſings beſtowed on themſelues,2 Some not for publike bleſſings. or on their families and friends; but regard not publike bleſſings beſtowed on Church or common-wealth: they account general bleſſings no bleſſings. Theſe diſcouer too much ſelfe-loue, too little ſence of the common good.
                     Other (who it may be) will be thankefull for ſuch publike bleſſings as are beſtowed on that Church and Common-wealth,3 Some not for the good of others. whereof they themſelues are members, neuer hearken after, nor care to heare of ſuch as a
                           •
                         beſtowed on the Churches of God in other Countries or if they doe heare of them, very little (if at all) are they affected therewith. Much leſſe are they affected with an
                           •
                        
                         bleſſings beſtowed on priuate Chriſtians, who are not of their kindred, alliance, acquaintance, with the like. This alſo ſheweth that they haue no fellow-feeling of the good of the myſticall body of Chriſt, or of the ſeuerall members thereof; which might make them feare that they themſelues are ſcarce ſound members of that body: if they were, there would aſſuredly be ſome ſympathy betwixt themſelues and other members, ſome mutual compaſſion, and fellow-feeling: they would reioyce with them that reioice. Nay further, theſe ſhew (which is worſe) what little zeale they haue of Gods glory: for to take notice of Gods mercies on others, as well as on our ſelues, to talke of them, to be thankefull for them, doth much amplifie the glory of Gods workes: it maketh them to be more famous. How many more the perſons bee that praiſe God for any bleſſings, ſo much greater glory redoundeth to Gods name: thereforePſal. 118. 1. &amp;c. 
                        Dauid oft ſtirres vp others beſides himſelfe to praiſe God for fauours beſtowed on himſelfe.
                     Further,4 Some not for aduerſity. many may be thankefull for proſperity, but very few will be ſo for aduerſity. To bee thankefull for paine, ſickneſſe, penury, ignominy, impriſonment, loſſe of goods, loſſe of friends, with the like, is a rare matter. Theſe things cauſe rather in moſt men murmuring, and repining againſt God. For few conſider the bleſſed fruit that commeth from thoſe things, neither thinke that they can be any bleſſings. Theſe ſhew how they walke by ſence, and not by faith.
                     Finally, among thoſe who are thankefull for ſuch bleſſings as they enioy,5 Some not for bleſſings to come. how few lift vp the eyes of their faith further then the eies of their body can reach? how few conſider thoſe good things which God hath promiſed for the time to come? how few can praiſe God for any good thing, whereof they haue not the preſent fruition? Moſt thinke it enough to praiſe God for ſuch things as they haue; they little conſider that the matter of thankſgiuing extendeth not onely to benefits receiued, but alſo to benefits promiſed. Theſe manifeſt little credence to the truth of Gods word: if they were fully reſolued thereof, they would account Gods words to be very deeds.
                     Thus wee ſee how faulty moſt are in the performance of this duty, and how ſhort they come of this generall extent of Thankſgiuing, which is without reſtraint; for ALL THINGS. Let vs examine our owne ſoules in this point, and be conſcionable euen in this extent.
                     Becauſe this fourth branch concerning the matter of Thankſgiuing, is on the one ſide a point worthy to be obſerued: and on the other ſide, a point too too much neglected, I haue beene bold to inſiſt the longer vpon it.

                     §. 73. Directions for Thankſgiuing.
                     BEfore I cōclude this point of Thankſgiuing, I wil add
                           •
                         ſome few directions, which being well obſerued, wil
                           •
                         be very helpfull vnto vs in the performance of this duty.
                     The firſt is,1 Lift vp eies to the author of bleſſings. that we lift vp our eyes vnto the Author o
                           •
                         all bleſſings, and be perſwaded that they come from God
                           •
                         and are brought vnto vs by Gods good guiding prouidence; and not (as the vulgar and ignorant ſort of people thinke and ſpeake) by chance, lucke, fortune, and the like. It was Iſraels fault,Oſe. 2. 8. that ſhee did not know that God gaue her corne and wine, &amp;c: which made her ſo vngratefull and rebellious againſt God.Iſa. 1. 3. The like reaſon is giuen of Iudahs ingratitude, in which reſpect ſhee is made worſe then the moſt brutiſh beaſts that be, namely, the Oxe &amp; the Aſſe: for the Oxe knoweth his Owner, and the Aſſe his Maſters crib, but my people (ſaith God) hath not vnderſtood: what vnderſtood they not? namely who beſtowed on them the good things which they enioyed. The truth is, that moſt men are like ſwine,Simile. which eate the fruite that falleth from the tree, but looke not vp to the tree from whence it falleth. Many who daily taſte of the ſweetnes of Gods bleſſings, neuer lift vp their hearts to the Author of them.An impious thing to attribute Gods bleſſings to fortune. They thinke it is a good fortune, a good hap or chance that they haue what they haue. This is an heatheniſh conceit, very vnbeſeeming Chriſtians, yea, an impious and ſacrilegious conceit, derogatory to the honour of God. What a ſhame is it then for Chriſtians to nouriſh it in their harts, and profeſſe it with their mouthes. For our parts let vs duely conſider that all good things are by Gods prouidence beſtowed on vs, that ſo our hearts may be raiſed vp to him, and we moued to be the more thankfull.
                     The ſecond is,2 Take particular notice of Gods bleſſings. that wee take diſtinct notice of Gods bleſſings, and in particular acknowledge them, and accordingly giue thankes for them vnto the Lord. (Reade for this purpoſe, Pſal. 103, &amp; 105, &amp; 106.) Particular notice of diſtinct bleſſings maketh vs the better prize them, and ſo inlargeth our hearts the more to praiſe God for them. A generall Thankeſgiuing, is for the moſt part a colde thankeſgiuing. What life is there in this forme, God bee thanked for all, when nothing at all is acknowledged: yet is this generall forme of Thankſgiuing all the thankſgiuing which many yeeld vnto the Lord.
                     The third is,3 Accept Gods bleſſings as tokens of his fauour. that we accept Gods bleſſings as tokens of his loue and fauour, and accordingly reioice in them. Dauid obſerued the kindneſſe of the Lord in the bleſſings which God beſtowed on him, and thereupon ſaith vnto God;Pſal. 138. 2. 
                        I will praiſe thy name, becauſe of thy kindneſſe. Where no ſweetneſſe of Gods bleſſings is taſted, there can no ſound thankes be rendred. Now vnleſſe we be perſwaded that God in Loue beſtoweth his bleſſings on vs, what ſweet relliſh can they giue vnto vs? If we feared that Gods bleſſings were like hot coales heaped on our heads, giuen in wrath (as a King was giuen to Iſraell) little deuotion could we haue to thanke God for them:Oſe. 13. 11. nothing more ſtirreth vp gratefulneſſe then a perſwaſion of kindneſſe.
                     The fourth is,4 Obſerue what we haue receiued aboue others. that we obſerue what God hath beſtowed on vs aboue others, and what others want that we haue: Thus did Dauid amplifie Gods mercies ſhewed to Iſrael, ſaying;Pſal. 147. 19, 20. 
                        He hath not dealt ſo with euery nation, neither haue they knowledge of his iudgements. Thus doe Gods children in their formes of thankſgiuing vſe alſo to amplifie Gods bleſſings, ſaying vnto him; Such and ſuch fauours haſt thou beſtowed on vs, which many more worthy thē we haue wanted. Wherefore let vs not ſo much conſider what others haue more then we, (for that will but make vs murmur and repine againſt God, and enuy our brethren) as what wee haue more then other: this will make vs truly thankefull.
                     The fift is,5 Conſider our vnworthines of the leaſt bleſſing. that we duly weigh how vnworthy we are of the very leaſt of Gods fauours, euen of the leaſt crum of bread which wee eate, and of the leaſt drop of drinke which we take.Gen. 32. 10. Thus did Iacob, ſaying to God; I am no
                              •
                            worthy of the leaſt of thy mercies, &amp;c. Who will giue thanks for that which he thinketh of due belongeth vnto
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 74. Of mentall Praier.
                     HItherto haue we heard of the diſtinct kinds of prayer in reſpect of the matter.What be the kinds of prayer in regard of the maner There are other diſtinctions in regard of the manner, as

                           1 Mentall, Vocall.
                           2 Sudden, compoſed.
                           3 Conceiued, preſcribed.
                           4 Publique, Priuate.
                           5 Ordinary, extraordinary.
                        
                     
                     1 Mentall praier is an inward opening of the deſire of a mans heart to God,Mentall prayer. without any outward manifeſtation of the ſame by word. Such a prayer was that which
Neh. 2. 4. 
                        Nehemiah made to the God of heauen, euen when he was talking with the King: andExo. 14. 15. 
                        Moſes when he was incouraging the people: and1 Sam. 1, 13. 
                        Annah who is ſaid to ſpeake in her heart.
                     
                     This may bee as feruent as if it were vttered. For in regard of the ardency of Moſes mentall praier, God ſaith,
Why crieſt thou vnto me? And Annah ſaith, She powred out her ſoule before the Lord. This oftentimes cauſeth the eies and hands to be lift vp, or caſt downe, and forceth ſuch outward ſignes.
                     This is vſed becauſe God is a ſearcher of the hearts,Reaſon. and knoweth the ſecrets thereof, and needeth not words to haue a mans thoughts made knowne to him, as wee ſhewed§. 4. and 6. Vſe.
                         before.
                     By this wee ſee that nothing can hinder prayer: but that in company, in the midſt of buſineſſes, when wee are ouerwhelmed with temptations, we may pray vnto God: here learne to doe it.

                     2 VOcall prayer is that which is vttered with words,2 Vocall praier. as1 King. 8. 23. that prayer which Salomon made at the dedication of the Temple.
                     
                        Queſt. Seeing God knoweth the ſecrets of the heart, what need words to expreſſe the meaning thereof?
                     
                        Anſw.
                        
                           Reaſons Why prayer is to be vttered with words. Firſt becauſe of Gods ordinance, as was ſhewed
§. 6. before?
                     Secondly, that men might know the deſires of one anothers heart, and ſo pertake of the mutuall prayers one of another: as in publique aſſemblies, in priuate families, and when friends meet together for that end. For words doe moſt liuely and plainely ſet forth the deſire of a mans heart, and men can beſt and moſt diſtinctly vnderſtand them.
                     3 Becauſe words doe not onely declare, but alſo ſtir vp and increaſe the affection of the heart. For as fire heateth a chimney, and the reflexion of heat which commeth from the chimney maketh the fire hotter, ſo the ardency of the heart prouoketh words, and words make the heart more ardent and earneſt.
                     4 Words are an eſpeciall meanes to keepe the minde in praier from wandering, and to hold it cloſe to the matter. A man that prayeth alone, and that onely in his inward meditation, will oft haue his meditations interrupted with other thoughts, and ſo his prayer ſtand at a ſtay, till after ſome time his former meditations come to his minde againe. Now the vttering of words will be a good meanes to preuent that interruption.
                     5 The tongue wherewith words are vttered, is of all other parts of a mans body the moſt proper and excellent inſtrument of Gods glore.Iames 3. 9. 
                        Therewith eſpecially bleſſe we God, and therefore by an excellency it is called glory. As

                        Awake my glory. And againe,and 108. 1. 
                        I will ſing and giue praiſe with my glory. In regard of theſe three laſt reaſons, it is meet to vſe words euen in priuate prayers when we are alone: Prouided that it be not for oſtentation to be known to pray, for that is a note of hypocriſieMat. 6. 5. condemned by our Lord in the Scribes and Phariſies.
                  
                  
                     §. 76. Of ſudden prayer.
                     SVdden prayer is when vpon ſome preſent occaſion the heart is inſtantly lift vp vnto God,3 Sudden. prayer. whether it be onely by ſome ſighes of the heart, or by ſome few words vttered. It is likely thatNeh. 2, 
                              •
                           
                         
                        Nehemiahs prayer was ſome ſudden deſire of the hart. For the King offring ſpeech vnto him, gaue him occaſion to make a ſuit vnto the King, which that he might obtain, he preſently lift vp his hart to God.
                     Theſe ſudden praiers are called ciaculations of the heart,
                        Simile. which are to be vſed as ſalt with meat: with euery bit of meat we commonly take a little ſalt to ſeaſon it. So when we doe any thing, when we confer of any thing, when we goe any whether, vpon all occaſions we muſt lift vp our hearts to God.
                     This argueth an holy familiarity with God,Reaſon. yea it manifeſteth an heauenly mind, euen as thoſe things which are ready vpon all occaſions to fly vpward appeare to be of a light aerial or fiery nature,Simile. not earthly, heauy, &amp; weighty.
                     This kind of praier muſt ſo be vſed, as it bee added to ſolemne and ſet prayers, and not make them to bee neglected. No man maketh a meale of ſalt alone, and refuſeth other ſolid meat, becauſe ſalt is now and then to be eaten. Much leſſe muſt theſe ſudden praiers hinder ſolemne or compoſed prayers.

                     COmpoſed prayer is when a Chriſtian ſetteth himſelfe to make ſome ſolemn prayer vnto God,4 Compoſed prayer. whether it be in Church, family, cloſet, field, or any other place; whether it be vttered with words, or onely conceiued in hart: as the morning and euening prayer which Chriſtians vſe to make, or the praier at ſolemne aſſemblies, with the like.

                     God to whom wee make our praier is a great God,Reaſons. of excellent Maieſty, not lightly, but with all due reuerence to bee regarded, and therefore moſt meet that wee ſhould compoſe our ſelues in a ſolemne manner to appeare before his glorious preſence.
                  
                  
                     §. 78. Of preparation before prayer.
                     THat this kinde of prayer may bee the better performed,Preparation needfull. preparation is very needefull, which the Preacher implyeth ſaying,Eccle. 5. 2. 
                        Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be haſty to vtter any thing before God.
                     
                     In preparation vnto prayer two things are to bee performed. Firſt we muſt empty our foules of al ſuch things as may hinder prayer. Secondly fill them with ſuch things as may be helpfull thereunto.
                     The things that hinder are either wicked or worldly.
                     Wicked things are againſt God, or againſt man.
                     Againſt God are all ſinnes,Hinderances of prayer. and tranſgreſſions of his Law. Theſe we muſt ſearch out, and hauing found them out, ſet our ſelues with a full and honeſt purpoſe of heart vtterly to forſake them.Pſal. 66. 18. 
                        If we regard wickednes, God will not heare our prayer. Whereupon ſaithand 26. 6. 
                        Dauid I will waſh mine hands in inocency, O Lord, and compaſſe thine alter.
                     
                     
                         Againſt man are wrath, anger, malice, and ſuch like reuengeful affections, in regard whereof the Apoſtle exhorteth to1 Tim. 28. 
                        lift vp pure hands without wrath. AndMat. 5. 24. Chriſt cōmanded to be reconciled before the gift be offered. In a word then, that we may empty our ſoules of al ſuch wicked things both againſt God and man, which would hinder our praiers, theſe two things are needfull▪ Firſt repentance towards God: ſecondly, reconciliation with man.
                     Worldly things are ſuch cares, as concerne the things of this life: our temporall eſtate, &amp; earthly affaires, which though at other times they may be warantable, commendable, and needfull, yet may be an incumberance &amp; hinderance vnto praier. This was prefigured vnder the Law▪ by that riteExo. 3, 5. Ioſh, 5. 15. of plucking off ſhooes when men appeared before the Lord. Shooes are lawfull to be worne, yea very needfull, yet in approching before the Lord they muſt be put off. So moderate care concerning the buſineſſe &amp; affairs of this world are lawfull and needful, yet when we goe to prayer, they muſt be laid aſide, and our ſoules emptied of them. For they are as heauy burdens, and clogs which will hold downe our hearts, and keepe them from flying vp into heauen. Now note the counſell of the Apoſtle,
Heb. 12. 1. Helps to prayer. 
                        Caſt away euery thing that preſſeth downe.
                     
                     If our ſoules be onely emptied of theſe things, they are like thatMat. 12. 44. 45. empty houſe which the vnclean ſpirit finding, entreth into with ſeauen other ſpirits. Wherfore that we may bee prepared to prayer, wee muſt be filled with ſuch ſpirituall matters as fit prayer: which are concerning God and our ſelues. Gods greatneſſe is to be meditated of, to ſtrike our hearts with reuerence: and his goodneſſe to breed faith in vs. Yea alſo his bleſſings beſtowed to fill our mouths with praiſe. Our wretchedneſſe is duely to be weighed, that wee may bee truely humbled: and our wants are to be obſerued, that wee may know what to aske. Thus are we to come prepared to compoſed praier.
                  
                  
                     § 79. Of conceiued praier.
                     
                        COnceiued prayer is that which he who vttereth the prayer inuenteth &amp; conceiueth himſelfe,Conceiued prayer. as are moſt of the praiers recorded in the Scripture. This kind of prayer the Saints in al ages haue vſed, It is very commendable, expedient, and needfull▪ For,
                     1 It manifeſteth the gift and power of the Spirit,Reaſons. who can giue both matter and manner, words and affections: who can ſuggeſt what to pray, and how to pray.
                     2 Euery day we haue new wants, new aſſaults, new ſinnes: Is it not needfull then that our praiers be conceiued and framed accordingly, that our petitions be made according to our preſent wants, our ſupplications according to our particular aſſaults, our confeſſion according to our ſeuerall ſinnes?
                     3 As God daily continueth and reneweth old bleſſings, ſo alſo hee addeth new to them. Is it not moſt meete that notice bee taken of thoſe new bleſſings, and accordingly thankes bee giuen in particular for them?
                     
                        Obiect. This preſent inuenting and conceiuing of prayer, maketh prayer to bee confuſed, and either very defectiue, or very tedious.
                     
                        Anſw. In them that haue not ability to pray, or ſuddenly and raſhly come vnto prayer, it may bee ſo. But if a man haue any competent ability, if he premeditate before hand what to pray, if hee ſet vnto himſelfe any good method and order, ſuch defect, tediouſneſſe, and confuſion (as is ſuppoſed) will bee eaſily auoided.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 80. Of preſcribed prayer.
                     
                        PReſcribed prayer is,6 Preſcribed prayer. when a ſet, conſtant forme is laid downe before hand, and either conned by heart, or read out of a booke or paper by him that vttereth it, and that whether he be alone, or in company.
                     
                        Queſt. Is a ſet and preſcribed forme of praier lawfull?
                     
                        Anſw.
                        Reaſons. Yea verily, and that for theſe reaſons:
                     1Num. 23. 24. God preſcribed a ſet forme of bleſſing for the Prieſts conſtantly to vſe. The 92. Pſalme, which is a Pſalme of praiſe, was preſcribed a ſong for the Sabbath day: and 102. Pſalme preſcribeth a prayer for the afflicted when he is ouerwhelmed, and powreth out his complaint before the Lord.
                        2 Chr. 20. 21. The 136. Pſalme was ſung after Dauids time.and 29. 30. 
                        Hezekiah the King, and the Princes commanded the Leuites to praiſe the Lord with the words of Dauid, and of Aſaph the Seer. If a preſcribed forme of praiſe may be vſed, then alſo of prayer: for there is the ſame reaſon of both.
                     Beſides, Chriſt himſelfe preſcribed an excellent forme of prayer which hath been vſed in all ages of the Church ſince this time, and is by an excellency called the Lords Prayer. Saint Paul obſerues a ſet forme of bleſſing in the beginning and end of his Epiſtles. Thus we ſee preſcribed prayer warranted by Gods word.
                     2 Many weake ones who haue good affections, but want inuention, vtterance, and ſuch like parts, are much helped by preſcribed formes: for when they reade or heare words fitting their wants and occaſions, their hearts can well goe with their words, yet can they not inuent fit words.
                     3 Preſcribed formes of prayer in the publike worſhippe is a good meanes to maintaine vniformity in ſeuerall Churches.
                     
                        
                        Obiect. The ſpirit is ſtinted hereby: neither can a man vtter that which the ſpirit moueth him vnto, when hee hath a ſet forme preſcribed.
                     
                        Anſw. The ſpirit in him which prayeth by a ſet forme, is no more ſtinted, then the ſpirit is ſtinted in thoſe which heare another pray: for to them which heare others, words are preſcribed. To the hearers it is all one whether hee that prayeth vſeth a preſcribed forme, or conceiue, and inuent his prayer, for they goe along in their hearts with his words.
                     They who ſimply and altogether condemne preſcribed prayer, doe thinke too childiſhly of God, and deale too iniuriouſly with Gods little ones. They conceit God to be affected with variety, and make the power of praier to conſiſt in copie of words, and nouelty of matter, which is many times an hinderance to true deuotion: for while the minde is too much occupied in inuention, the heart cannot be ſo free to deuotion, as otherwiſe it might bee. Prayer is not like a noſe-gay, which is no longer ſweete then the flowers are new and freſh: For the ſweete ſauour of prayer conſiſteth in the ſincerity of heart, and ardency of affection, whereby alſo the power of the ſpirit is manifeſted.
                     2 The iniury which is done to Gods little ones is this, that they ſeek to depriue them of an eſpecial help, whereby their weakeneſſe might be ſupported, yea to hinder them of the benifit of prayer. For many are not able to conceiue a prayer of themſelues, yet if they finde a forme anſwerable to their occaſions, they can pray heartily and earneſtly.
                     Thus wee ſee that preſcribed prayer is not onely lawfull, but alſo needful. So far forth as we finde it an helpe to deuotion, we may vſe it: but yet wee may not alwaies tie our ſelues vnto it: to ſay the leaſt, they are very weake Chriſtians that cannot pray without a preſcribed forme.
                     Now it is a ſhame for any Chriſtian to be a weake one all the dayes of his life: it is required at our hands to grow in knowledge, iudgement, diſcretion, faith, and other like graces.
                  
                  
                     §. 81. Direction to conceiue a Prayer.
                     IF the weakeſt Chriſtians doe but carefully obſerue the order that others vſe, and withall take notice of their owne ſinnes in particular, of their particular wants, and of the particular bleſſings which God beſtoweth on them, they may with vſe and practiſe come to conceiue a good Prayer. And when once in any competent meaſure they can pray for themſelues, by degrees they come to pray for others alſo. But many are too idle and ſluggiſh in making triall: they will not offer to make experience of the gift of Gods Spirit: but rather vtterly quench it; as a man may doe, and too many ſo doe, by tying themſelues too much to ſet formes.
                     Though publike leiturgies for vniformity ſake are to be conſtantly vſed in ſet formes (prouided that there be ſeuerall prayers fit for diuers, yea, for all publike occaſions ſo neere as may be) yet it is not ſo meete for particular perſons alwayes to tie themſelues to one ſet forme. For what can that argue but that they little obſerue Gods different manner of dealing with them at ſeuerall times.
                  
                  
                     §. 82. Of publike Prayer, and of the Miniſters function therein.
                     PVblike Prayer is when an aſſembly of Saints publikely with one ioint conſent call vpon God.7 Publike Prayer.
                     
                     In publike prayer, three things are requiſite.
                     1 Meete perſons.
                     
                         2 A fit place.
                     3 A right manner.
                     1 The Perſons muſt bee a publike Miniſter of the Word and People.
                        1 The perſons who make publike prayer. I ſhewed before that Prayer was a principall part of Gods publike worſhip. Now in all publike worſhip there is required a Miniſter for one party, and
People for the other. A Miniſter hath a double function; one to ſtand in Gods roome, and in Gods name to declare Gods minde and will vnto his people. Another to ſtand in the Peoples roome, and in their name to declare their minde and deſire to God.
                     The former hee doth in preaching the Word and adminiſtring the Sacraments. For God (ſaith the Apoſtle)
2 Cor. 5. 19, 20. 
                        Hath committed to vs the word of reconciliation: now then are we Embaſſadors for Chriſt, &amp;c. Expreſly it is ſaid, that Miniſters are Chriſts Embaſſadors, which is in regard of the Word that alſo they are ſuch in regard of the Sacraments, is implied in that commiſſion giuen to the Apoſtles,
Mat. 28. 19 
                        Goe teach all Nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father, &amp;c.
                     
                     The latter hee doth in making Petitions and giuing thankes to God:Ioel 2. 16, 17 When the Prophet had exhorted the people to aſſemble together publikely to pray: he ſaith;
Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord ſay, ſpare thy people O Lord, and giue not thine heritage into reproach, &amp;c. Miniſters therefore in publike Aſſemblies are to vtter the petitions of people: ſo it is noted thatNeh. 8. 1. 6 when the people were aſſembled to giue thankes to God, Ezra the Prieſt praiſed the Lord.
                        Exod. 30. 7 The incenſe which vnder the Law was offered by the Prieſt to God, did prefigure thus much.
                     Thus as in preaching a Miniſter is Gods mouth to the people, ſo in praying, the peoples mouth to God. Wherefore alſo there muſt be people to ioine with him: for if a Miniſter be alone, his Prayer is but a priuate Prayer.
                  
                  
                     §. 83. Of the Peoples conſent in publike Prayer.
                     THat which is required of people in publike Prayer, is to teſtifie their conſent to that which the Miniſter vttereth: for the prayer of the Miniſter is their prayer: thogh for order ſake to auoid confuſion there be but one voice vttered, yet the hearts of all preſent muſt goe along with that voice &amp; giue an inward aſſent, &amp; not ſo only, but alſo it is very expedient to teſtifie the ſame, ſo as the Miniſter may heare their conſent, as well as they heare his prayer.
                     The ordinary way,
                           Amen, is originally an Hebrew word, yet vſed in all languages: it ſignifieth Truth or Faith: the vttering of it, after a Prayer, in plieth an aſſent vnto the Prayer, and faith for obtaining that which is praied for. and the beſt way for people to manifeſt their conſent, is with a diſtinct and audible voice to ſay
Amen. Thus the people were commanded to ſay Amen. Deut. 27. 15. &amp;c. And accordingly was it practiſed. Nehe. 8. 6. It is a ſound well beſeeming Gods publike worſhip, to make the place ring againe (as we ſpeake) with a ioint Amen of the people.Ad ſimilitudinem caelectis tonitrui, Amen reboat. Hier. proaem. in 2. lib. cōment. ad Gal. The Iewes vttered this word with great ardency, and therefore vſed to double it, ſaying,
Amen, Amen. Neh. 8. 6.
                  
                  
                     §. 84. Of the place of publike Prayer.
                     2 THe place muſt be publike:2 The place of publike Prayer. Gen. 4. 26. ſuch a place as all that ought to meet may know, and haue liberty to come vnto: at firſt this was in ſome Family, yea, afterwards when all the world almoſt forſooke God, God choſe out of the world ſome peculiar families, who with their houſhold worſhipped God in their houſes; as Noah in his time, ſo Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, in their times. But when Gods people increaſed in the wilderneſſe, hee cauſed a Tabernacle to be built; that then was their place of publike worſhip, afterwards a Temple was built, which becauſe it was the place of publike worſhip, was by a propriety called,Iſa. 56. 7. 
                        The houſe of Prayer. To this place if the people could not come,Dan. 6. 10. they would at leaſt pray towards it: for which they had their warrant from1 Kin. 8. 44. 
                        Salomons prayer.
                     After that Chriſt came, by whom the partition wall betwixt Iewes and Gentiles was broken downe, and both made one people to God,1 Tim. 2. 8. all places were ſanctified for Prayer: in which reſpect Chriſt ſaid;Ioh. 4. 21. 
                        The houre commeth when ye ſhall neither in this mountaine, nor at Ieruſalem worſhip the Father. So as vnder the Goſpell no one place is more holy then another. Yet it being Gods will to be worſhipped publikely, needefull it is that there ſhould be places fit for that purpoſe. Thus1 Cor. 11. 20 the Corinthians had one place to worſhip God in.
                     In Kingdomes and Nations where Gods worſhip is maintained, are Churches, and Chappels built for that purpoſe. Theſe being ſet apart for Gods publike worſhip, Miniſters and people are to reſort vnto them.
                     Yet I denie not but in times of perſecution, ſecret and vnknowne places (ſecret I ſay, and vnknowne to haters and perſecutors of Religion, but knowne to true profeſſors) may be vſed for publike prayer:Acts 16. 13. as certaine Inhabitants of Philippi went out to a Riuers ſide to pray on the Sabbath day.Separatiſts taxed. Separatiſts which liue in this Land, and other like places, where are publike places for prayer appointed, whereunto all haue liberty to reſort, commit a double fault: one in abſtaining from ſuch publike places, whereby they ſhew themſelues contemners of publike Prayer: the other, that they ſeeke priuate places, as houſes, woods, and boates, for publike prayer: whereby (to ſay the leaſt) they turne Gods publike worſhip into a priuate worſhip. Too neer to theſe doe many Schiſmatikes come, who though they frequent our Churches to heare the Word preached, yet will they not be preſent in time of publike prayer, wherby they depriue God of one part, and that the moſt principall part of his publike worſhip.

Acts 2. 46. 
                        with one accord. For this end in publike worſhip a voyce is neceſſarie: for how can there be a conſent of heart, vnleſſe one know anothers minde? how can that be knowne but by the voice? it is the principall end of ſpeech, to make knowne a mans minde. A voice vſed in publike prayer muſt be

                           Audible.
                           Intelligible.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 86. Of vttering publike prayer with an audible voice.
                     1 IT muſt be ſo lowde as all that are preſent (if it bee poſſible) may heare it.The Miniſters voice muſt be audible. For a voice not heard is as no voice to them which heare it not: they can giue no aſſent, and ſo pray not: it is noted that1. King. 8. 55 
                        Salomon Bleſſed all the congregation with a lowde voice.
                     
                     It is a fault for a Miniſter in the Church to pray ſo ſoftly, as all the people cannot heare him: ſome that are able to vtter a loud voice, &amp; that preach loud inough, in praier cannot be heard: is there not as much reaſon that people ſhould heare their Miniſter pray, as preach? other that are loud inough, in the midle &amp; ending of their prayer, cānot be heard in the beginning: but euery word ought ſo to be vttered, as it may be heard. It is a fault alſo in people ſo to ſay Amen,
                        
                           Amen to be vttered aloud. as they cannot be heard: why ſhould not the Miniſter as well heare the aſſent of his people, as they heare his prayer? it cannot but ſlacken the ardencie of a Miniſters affection, when he cannot perceiue any conſent in people to that which he prayeth: but a cheerefull and euident aſſent doth quicken and cheare vp his ſpirit.
                  
                  
                     §. 87. Of praying in a knowne tongue.
                     2 IT muſt be ſuch a kinde of voice,The Miniſters voice muſt be intelligible. and ſo vttered, as all that heare it may vnderſtand it: for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of publike prayer,1. Cor. 14. 15 
                        I will pray with vnderſtanding, that is, ſo as others may vnderſtand me. Otherwiſe a lowd voice is no benefit at all. If a trumpet ſhould be ſounded, and the ſound not diſcerned,1. Cor. 14. 8. 
                        who ſhall prepare himſelfe to battaile thereby? That a mans voice may be intelligible, his language wherein hee ſpeaketh muſt bee knowne, and his ſpeech diſtinct.
                  
                  
                     §. 88. Of the aberrations contrary to praying with vnderſtanding.
                     IT is vtterly vnlawfull to pray in a ſtrange tongue:Vnlawfull to pray in a ſtrange tongue.
                        1. Cor. 14. 6. &amp;c. a thing againſt which the Apoſtle purpoſely and copiouſly diſputeth. To omit many other arguments, which might be alledged againſt prayer in an vnknown tongue, let this one be noted, that an vnknown tongue depriueth a man of the ſence of Gods fauour in hearing his prayer. For how can he, who knoweth not what he hath asked, know when his petition is granted. Prayer in a knowne tongue hath reſpect both to the party that vttereth the prayer (he muſt vnderſtand what he vttereth, or elſe his prayer is but a lippe-labour, euen meere babling, which
Matth. 6. 7. Chriſt condemneth) and alſo to them who heare it, their hearing if they vnderſtand not,1. Cor. 14. 17, 23. is no hearing, they cannot be edified thereby.
                     Papiſts offend in both theſe.
                     1 They teach children, women, lay-men, ſuch as vnderſtand not one word of Latin, to make all their prayers in Latine.
                     2 They preſcribe their publike prayers, whereof all the people partake, to be made in Latine.
                     To affect in prayer ſuch vncouth words,2 To vſe curious phraſes in prayer. and curious phraſes as exceed the capacitie of the vnlearned, is little better then to pray in a ſtrange tongue.1. Cor. 4. 16. The Apoſtle ſheweth that prayers muſt be ſo vttered, as the vnlearned may ſay Amen.
                     
                     Contrary to diſtinct praying,3 To tumble ouer a prayer too faſt. it is for a Miniſter to mumble and tumble ouer his words too faſt: it argueth want of reuerence, it hindereth deuotion and affection of heart (for when a prayer is too faſt poſted ouer, what time can there be for the heart to worke) it alſo hindereth attention, and vnderſtanding in the hearer.
                  
                  
                     §. 90. Of vniformitie in publike prayer.
                     VNiformity reſpecteth the outward carriage and geſture in prayer. Of reuerend and humble geſture I ſpake§. 11. before. The point now to be noted is, that al which aſſemble together in one place to pray, doe vſe one &amp; the ſame ſeemly geſture,Neh. 8. 5. which is noted of the people in Ezraes time, when he opened the booke to reade, all ſtood vp,
                        verſ. 6. and when he praiſed the Lord, they al bowed thēſelues, &amp;c. This outward vniformity preuenteth a prepoſterous cenſuring of one another, &amp; may be a meanes of ſtirring vp one anothers affections: for when one ſeeth others humbly to kneele down, his hart may be ſo ſtruck, as he wil be moued with reuerence to humble his owne ſoule: but diuerſity of geſtures may cauſe diſtractions, and hinder deuotions: vniformity in that which is lawfull &amp; warrantable is an eſpeciall part of good order: diuerſity of geſtures cauſeth a kind of confuſion. Now1. Cor. 14. 33 
                        God is not the author of confuſion: whereforeVerſ. 40. 
                        all things are to be done decently and in good order. The beſt generall rule that we can obſerue to keepe order, is, to yeeld to ſuch commendable, and warrantable geſtures as the Church wherein wee liue preſcribeth and practiſeth.
                  
                  
                     §. 91. Of motiues to publike prayer.
                     THus hauing giuē ſome directions for publike prayer,Motiues to publike prayer. I will lay downe ſome motiues to ſtirre vs with conſcience to performe it.
                     1 The more publike prayer is,1 It is more honorable and acceptable. the more honorable &amp; acceptable it is to God. If it be an honor to God for one to pray, the more do ioyne together therin, the more honorable it muſt needs be: it is the more acceptable, becauſe God delights in the ioynt conſent of his Saints worſhipping him: whereupon God promiſed,Mat. 18 20. 
                        Where two or three were gathered together in his name, to be in the midſt of them.
                     
                     2 It is alſo the more powerfull:2 It is more powerfull. the cries of many ioyned together make a lowde crie in Gods eares, and moue him the ſooner to open his eares. Hereupon when there was a iudgement in the Land,Ioel. 2. 16, 17 the Prophet calleth all the people to aſſemble together to pray: and ſo didIohn 3. 8. the King of Niniueh, when the ruine thereof was threatned.
                     3 It is an outward ſigne whereby wee manifeſt our ſelues to be of the choſen and called flocke of Chriſt.3 It is a ſigne of communion.
                     
                     4 It is an eſpeciall meanes of mutuall edification: for thereby we mutually ſtirre vp the zeale,4 It is a meanes of edification. and inflame the affection of one another.
                     5 The neglect of it is a note of prophaneneſſe, from which blame Separatiſts,5 The neglect of it, is a note of prophaneneſſe. and Schiſmatiques though they would ſeem very religious, cānot well acquit themſelues

                     §. 92. Of priuate Prayer.
                     
                        PRiuate prayer is that which is made by ſome few together,Priuate prayer. or by one alone: by few, as when two or three friends goe together into ſome ſecret place (as2. King. 4. 33 when Eliſha and his ſeruant were alone in a chamber praying for the Shunamites childe, andLuke 9. 28. Chriſt tooke Peter, and Iohn, and Iames, and went into a mountaine to pray) or an whole houſhold pray together in the family, asActs 10. 30. when Cornelius prayed in his houſe. This charge eſpecially belōgeth to the maſter of the family. For as he is in his family a Lord to gouerne, and a Prophet to teach, ſo alſo a Prieſt to offer vp the ſacrifice of prayer: as a Miniſter in the Church, ſo hee in the houſe muſt vtter the prayer (or at leaſt prouide one to performe that dutie) and withall, cauſe his whole houſhold to be preſent thereat.
                  
                  
                     §. 93. Of prayer in a family.
                     1 THe family hath need of peculiar bleſſings,Reſons for prayer in a family. which by prayer are to be ſought, beſides the publike and common bleſſings which in the Church are prayed for:1 The need of it. yea it receiueth many bleſſings, for which peculiar thankes are to be giuen in the houſe.
                     2 A Chriſtians houſe is made Gods Church,2 The honor of it. if Gods worſhip (a principall part whereof is prayer) bee there from time to time performed, which is a great honor vnto a family. Wherefore, for honors ſake, Saint Paul mentioneth
Rom. 16. 5. the Church in the houſe of Priſcilla and Aquila, andPhil. v. 2. of Philemon.
                     
                     3 By prayer a Chriſtian bringeth Gods bleſſing into3 The profit of it.
                         his houſe (which is a matter of great profite) for where God is called vpon, there is he preſent to beſtow his bleſſing, as2. Sam. 6. 11. he bleſſed Obed-edom, and all his houſhold, while the Arke was in his houſe. Prayer then bringeth both honor and profit vnto a Family.
                     Vnworthy they are to be gouernours of a family,
                           Vſe. Reproofe of thoſe who neglect prayer in their families. who omit this duetie therein. They cauſe Gods curſe to lye vpon their houſe, and depriue themſelues of a iuſt right vnto all the goods which are therein. For by prayer they are all ſanctified: he that vſeth any thing without prayer, is an vſurper and a robber; and ſhall another day dearely anſwere for it. They who frequent publike prayer at Church, and neglect priuate prayer at home, are either ſuperſtitious, or hypocriticall perſons.
                  
                  
                     §. 94. Of ſecret Prayer.
                     THe prayer which is made by one alone,9 Secret prayer. none being preſent but God and he which prayeth, I may call Secret prayer. This may be inMat. 6. 6. a cloſe chamber, or cloſet,
Marke 1. 35. or on a deſolate mountaine,Gen. 24. 63. or in a ſecret field, orAct. 10. 9. on any houſe top,1. Tim. 2. 8. or in any other place.
                     It is very needfull that ſecret prayer bee added both to publike prayer at Church,Reaſons for ſecret prayer. and priuate prayer in Family, for theſe reaſons.
                     1 Hereby we may more freely powre out our whole hearts vnto God:1. In it we may moſt freely make knowne our whole minde. it is not meete that any other perſon ſhould know many things which are knowne to God, and cannot be concealed from him. Euery one is guiltie of ſuch particular ſinnes, as are to be acknowledged alone before God, and euery one hath particular wants to bee prayed for by himſelfe. Hereby alſo wee may by name mention in our praiers to God our deareſt friends, which is not ſo meete to doe in company. I thinke Saint Paul
                         meant ſuch Secret prayers, when he ſaid,Rom. 1. 9, 10 
                        I make mention of you alwayes in my prayers.
                     
                     2 This kind of prayer affordeth the trueſt triall of the vprightneſſe of a mans heart:2 By it trueſt triall of our vprightneſſe is made. for a man may long continue to pray in the Church and in a family, and his prayer be meere formall, euen for company ſake: but he that alone in ſecret, when and where no other man knoweth, calleth vpon God, ſurely maketh conſcience of prayer, and hath an honeſt heart (though hee may haue much weakneſſe, and many imperfections) or elſe hee would ſoone omit his courſe of praying in ſecret. For what byreſpect is there that ſhould moue him to continue it, vnleſſe hee bee Popiſh, and thinke that the ſaying of a few prayers in ſecret is a meritorious worke?
                     3 This argueth a great familiaritie with God,3 It argueth familiaritie with God. when a ſubiect vſeth to goe alone to his Soueraigne, it argueth much more familiaritie, then when hee commeth with a petition in the company of others.
                     4 It bringeth greateſt comfort vnto a mans heart:4 It bringeth much comfort. for ſuch is the corruption of our nature, that we cannot performe any holy exerciſe as we ought (Rom. 7. 21. 
                        When we would do good, euill is preſent with vs) whereby it commeth to paſſe that the comfort of ſuch holy exerciſes, which wee performe in Church or houſe, is taken away. This maketh Chriſtians to run to God in ſecret, to humble themſelues for the imperfections of their publike prayers. Chriſtians would much doubt, and euen faint oftentimes, if it were not for their ſecret prayers. They which content themſelues with Church and family prayers, haue iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect themſelues.
                     5 Such wiues,5 By it ſupply is made in want of other prayers. children, ſeruants and other inferiours, which liue in any houſe vnder prophane gouernours, that will not haue prayers in their families, may by this kinde of prayer make ſupply thereof vnto their owne ſoules: none can hinder ſecret prayer.
                     
                        Obiect. Wee can haue neither time nor place to pray ſecretly.
                     
                        Anſw. Doe yee not finde many times and places to commit ſinne ſo ſecretly as none can ſee you? if you had as great delight in prayer as in ſinne, you would find time and place.
                     This kinde of prayer (ſo neere as may be) is to be performed ſo ſecretly,Direction. as no other may know it, leſt the knowledge which others haue of it, may miniſter occaſion of inward pride,Mat. 6. 6. 
                        Shut the doore, ſaith Chriſt. It is not meete to vtter ſecret prayer ſo lowde as any other ſhould heare it.
                  
                  
                     §. 95. Of extraordinary prayer.
                     THe laſt diſtinction of prayer, is ordinary and extraordinary. All the forenamed kinds are ordinary, therefore I ſhall not need to ſpeake of it.
                     
                        Extraordinary prayer,
                        10 Extraordinary prayer. is that which after an extraordinary manner, euen aboue our vſuall cuſtome, is powred out before God This conſiſteth partly in ardencie of affection, and partly in continuance of time.Ioh. 3. 8. The King of Niniueh required an extraordinary ardencie, when hee commanded his people to cry mightily vnto God. Wee haue a memorable example hereof in Moſes, who was ſo earneſt in his prayer, thatExod. 32. 32. rather then not haue his petition granted, he deſired to be raſed out of Gods Booke. Chriſts ardencie yet exceeded this; it is noted that hee prayedLuke 22. 44. 
                        earneſtly,
                        Heb. 5. 7. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        with ſtrong crying and teares. Yea his ardency made his ſweat to be as great drops of blood falling downe to the ground.
                     
                     This ardencie is in Scripture ſet forth by diuers Metaphors, asIoel. 2. 13. 
                        renting the heart,
                        Exod. 14. 15 
                        crying,
                        Rom. 15. 30. 
                        ſtriuing,
                        Gen. 32. 24 
                        wreſtling with God, &amp;c.
                     
                     Though this ardency be an inward worke, yet can it hardly containe it ſelfe within a man: but as thunder, which is an heate conceiued within a cloude, becauſe of the ardency of that inward heate burſteth forth, and cauſeth lightning, rumbling, and raine; ſo a vehement and earneſt deſire of the heart will ſome way or other manifeſt &amp; declare it ſelfe. Many waies are noted in the Scripture, whereby it hath beene manifeſted.

                     §. 97. Of teares in Prayer.
                     TEares are the moſt vſuall ſignes of earneſt and ardent Prayer, in which reſpect they are powerfull with God.Oſe. 1. 2. 4 
                        Iacob had power ouer the Angell, and preuailed; for why? He wept, and praied.
                        Heb. 5. 7 
                        Chriſt was heard in that which be feared. For why? He alſo offered vp prayers with teares.
                        Iſa. 38. 3 
                        Hezekiah wept ſore, and was heard. Peters teares, the ſinfull womans teares, Annahs teares, the teares of Gods children at all times haue beene regarded, and accepted. Yea, it is noted that GodPſal. 56. 8 hath a bottle wherein he putteth the teares of his Saints: and with great Emphaſis ſaith Dauid, Are they not in thy Booke? there recorded to be remembred?
                     
                        Obiect. Eſaus
                        Heb. 12. 17. teares were no whit regarded,Iud. 20. 23. nor the teares of the Iſraelites when they went to fight againſt
Beniamin, no nor2 Sam. 12. 22 
                        Dauids teares when he prayed, faſted, and wept for his child.
                     
                        Anſw. 1 Teares ſimply in themſelues are no whit acceptable vnto God, but as they are ſignes of true prayer.
Eſaus teares were not ſuch, they roſe from griefe of a worldly loſſe, and from anger, malice, and indignation againſt his brother.
                     Secondly, If any continue in ſinne, and repent not, their teares are not regarded. The Iſraelites had not repented of their owne ſinnes, and yet would take vengeance of their brothers ſinne: they wept becauſe they preuailed not, but they wept not becauſe they repented not of their owne ſinnes. Afterwards when in token of their repentance, they faſted, and offered burnt offerings, and peace offerings vnto the Lord,
                        Iudg. 20. 26 and ſo wept, the Lord heard them, and they preuailed againſt Beniamin.
                     
                     3 Though God grant not that particular which by teares is craued, yet may the teares be acceptable to the Lord, as Dauids were:
                     Then are teares moſt powerfull and effectuall,When teares are effectuall. when they ariſe from compunction of heart for ſinne committed againſt God, as the teares of the ſinfull woman, and of Peter. Nothing more moues the true Chriſtian heart to melt, and eyes to flow forth with teares, then a due conſideration of Gods tender and mercifull dealing with man, and his vngratefull, and vngracious cariage towards God. The feare of Gods wrath, and iudgements, and horror of hell, may ſtrike the heart with aſtoniſhment, and amazement, and make it as Nabals heart, like a ſtone. But griefe for diſpleaſing a mercifull Father,1 Sam. 25. 37. and ſorrow for loſſe of Gods fauour, is it which eſpecially maketh the

                        elly in prayer.12. Expounded.
                        Dan. 10. 2, 3 It may be gathered that Daniel continued one and twenty dayes in prayer. (Not that without any intermiſſion he ſo long prayed, but that euery day in that time hee returned to extraordinary prayer:) for ſo long he was in heauineſſe, and eate no pleaſant bread. (Now faſting and ſorrow in the Saints are companions of prayer,) beſides the Angell of God came to him at the end of thoſe three weekes (when his extraordinary prayers are to be ſuppoſed to end) and ſaid to him; From the firſt day that thou didſt ſet thine heart to vnderſtand, and to humble thy ſelfe before thy God, thy words were heard. Here he ſheweth that with Daniels humiliation prayer was ioined, elſe how could his words be heard. Secondly, that there were diuers daies ſpent therein, elſe he would not ſay from the first day, &amp;c. Now that firſt day being the beginning of the three weekes, and the Angell comming at the end of the three weekes, it is like he continued his extraordinary prayers ſo long.Pſal. 69. 3. 
                        Dauid indefinitely ſaith, that he cried till he was weary, till his throate was drie, till his eies failed.
                     
                     For extraordinary continuance,Intentio ſicut non eſt obtundenda ſi perdurare non poteſt, ita ſi perdurauerit, non cito eſt rumpenda. Aug. Epiſt. 121 he which prayeth muſt conſider his owne ſtrength and ability, and not endeauour to goe beyond that, for this is to prefer ſacrifice before mercy,Mat. 12 7. which is againſt Gods will.
                     Neuer muſt this branch of extraordinary prayer be ſeuered from the other, I meane continuance in time from feruency in heart. For though prayer may be extraordinarily feruent, when it is not long continued, asLuke 22. 24 Chriſts prayer, yet ought not prayer long to continue, except it be hearty and feruent; for then will it be no better then thatMat. 6. 7, &amp;c. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                        thoſe long prayers which Chriſt reproueth.
                     Thus hauing in generall ſhewed what is extraordinary prayer; for our better direction therein, and ſtirring vp thereunto, I will further declare: Firſt, the occaſions thereof. Secondly, helpes. Thirdly, motiues thereunto.
                  
                  
                     §. 99. Of the occaſions of extraordinary prayer.
                     THe occaſeons muſt be extraordinary,Occaſions of extraordinary prayer are, 1 Bleſſings with-held. and they may be drawne to two heads,

                           Bleſsings.
                           Iudgements.
                         For bleſſings, if they be withheld, extraordinary prayer muſt be vſed to obtaine them (1. Sam. 1. 11. thus Annah obtained a ſonne) if they bee withdrawne and taken away, to recouer them againe (Pſal. 51. 12. thus had Dauid the ioy of his ſaluation reſtored to him) In theſe two examples wee ſee both temporall and ſpirituall bleſſings, to be occaſions of extraordinary praier. Beſides, when we enterpriſe any thing that requireth an extraordinary bleſſing, extraornary prayer is to be vſed.2 Publike worſhip. As when we prepare our ſelues to ſanctifie the Sabbath, to partake of the holy Communion, or to haue our childe baptized:3 Waightie affaires. Likewiſe when wee marry, enter into any waightie calling, or office, eſpecially when Miniſters are ordained, or firſt ſet ouer vs. Chriſt prayed extraordinarily, when hee choſe his Apoſtles (Luke 6. 12. 13.) ſo did the Church when it ſent forth
Paul and Barnabas (Acts 13. 3.) And when they ordained Elders, (Acts 14. 2.)
                     Iudgements are either ſinnes,4 Temptations to ſinne. or puniſhments of ſins. In regard of ſinnes, extraordinary prayer is to be made, either to free vs from temptations thereunto, (asRom. 7. 24. 
                        Paul prayed with great ardencie, ſaying, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from the body of this death:
                        2. Cor. 12. 8. and againe, he prayed thrice againſt a temptation: yeaMat. 26. 41. Chriſt expreſly commandeth his Diſciples to watch and pray that they enter not into temptation) or to pardon ſuch ſinnes as haue been committed,5 Burden of ſinne. and lye heauie vpon our conſcience, becauſe they are in their kinde notorious, or we haue long continued in them, (thisPſal. 51. 1. &amp;c. mooued
                        Dauid very earneſtly to pray, as alſoMat. 26. 75.

                        Manaſſeth.
                     
                     Puniſhments of ſinne are either threatned,6 Puniſhmēts for ſinne. or inflicted.
They may by extraordinary prayer be preuented, (as
                        Ion. 3. 9 the deſtruction of Niniueh, threatned by Ionah was,) Theſe may be remoued (as2 Chr. 33. 12 
                        Manaſſes captiuity was.)
                     As ordinary prayer is to be made for others,7 Others need. as well as for our ſelues; ſo likewiſe extraordinary prayer is to be made for others, as iuſt occaſion is offered.Exod. 32. 31, 32. 
                        Moſes his extraordinary prayer was for the ſinne of the Iſraelites, and for Gods iudgement threatned againſt them; ſo wasEzra 9. 1, &amp;c.

                     THe helps affoorded to extraordinary prayer are eſpecially two,Faſting an helpe to extraordinary prayer.
                        
                           Faſting.
                           Vowing.
                        
                     
                     To Faſt according to the notation of the
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Greeke words, ſignifieth to abſtaine from foode. In this generall and large acceptation, a Faſt is diuerſly taken. For there is a phyſicall, politicke, inforced morall, ſpirituall, extraordinary, hypocriticall, ſuperſticious, hereticall, and religious faſt.
                     1 A phyſicall faſt,
                        1 The ſicke mans faſt. is when for health ſake a man forbeareth foode. In many caſes Phyſitians giue direction to their Patients to abſtaine from eating and drinking for a time.
                     2 A politicke faſt,
                        2 The Statemans faſt. is when ſomtimes of abſtaining from foode, are enioined for the preſeruation of plenty, and preuention of penury.
                     3 An inforced and neceſſary Faſt,
                        3 The poore mans faſt. is when men haue not ſufficient for ordinary meales: as in a City beſieged, or in a ſhip on Sea farre from Land, prouiſion being very ſcarſe, men are forced to take but one meale a day, or to make euery other day a faſting day. Thus many poore folke are forced often times to faſt, becauſe they haue nothing to eate.
                     4 A morall faſt,
                        4 The ſober mans faſt. is when men eate and drinke ſparingly, not ſo much as their appetite deſireth, but onely ſo much as may preſerue nature, and maintaine health and ſtrength, that their wanton and luſtfull fleſh may not be pampered, but rather kept vnder: to which purpoſe tendeth this exhortation of Chriſt;Luk. 21. 34. 
                        Take heed to your ſelues, leſt at any time your hearts be ouercharged with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe. This is not properly a faſt, becauſe ſomething is taken, but onely reſpectibly, becauſe ſomething is forborne.
                     5 A ſpirituall faſt,5 The ſanctified mans faſt. is when men abſtaine from vice, which is as food to their corrupt nature: Hereof the Lord ſpeaketh,Iſa. 58. 6. where he ſaith; Is not this the faſt which I haue choſen to looſe the bonds of wickedneſſe? This is called a faſt onely by way of reſemblance.
                     6 A miraculous faſt,
                        6 The extraordinary mans faſt. is when men extraordinarily aſſiſted by the power of God, abſtaine from all manner of foode longer then the nature of man is able to endure: ſuch were the faſts of Moſes, Eliah, and Chriſt,
                        Exod. 34. 28 1 Kings 19. 8. who faſted forty dayes together.Mat. 4. 2.
                     
                     7 An hypocriticall faſt,
                        7 The hypocrites faſt. is when men without reſpect to any occaſion of faſting, appoint ſet times weekely or monthly, or quarterly to faſt. Thus the Phariſies (Mat. 6. 16. whom
Chriſt taxeth of hypocriſie) faſted
                        Luke 18. 12. 
                        twice in a weeke; and

                           •
                        lamed Chriſt becauſe his Diſciples faſted not, not regarding the occaſion, asMat. 9. 15. 
                        Chriſt noteth in his anſwer to them.
                     8 A ſuperſticious fast,
                        8 The ſuperſtitious mans faſt. is when men place Religion and

                           •
                        olineſſe in the abſtaining from meate, making the very

                           •
                        utward act of faſting to be a part of Gods worſhip: contrary to that which the Apoſtle ſaith both of it, and other like outward exerciſes;1 Tim. 4. 8 
                        Bodily exerciſe profiteth little.
                     
                     9 An hereticall faſt,
                        9 The hereticks faſt. is when men making difference betwixt meats for conſcience ſake, abſtaine from one kind, and glut themſelues with another kind, and yet count this a faſt.Auguſt. de mor. Manich. l. 2. c. 13. So did the Manichees of old, and ſo doe the Papiſts at this day. This the Apoſtle reckoneth vp among the Doctrine of Diuels.

                     10 A religious faſt,
                        10 The true Chriſtians faſt. is when men ſeaſonably abſtaine from refreſhing their bodies, to make them fitter for religious dueties.

                     By the third, from a phyſicall, politicke, forced, and ſuperſtitious faſt: all which haue other ends then a religious faſt.

                     §. 102. Of forbearing to eate and drinke in the time of a Faſt.

                           I. Point. How farre we muſt abſtaine from refreſhing the body in a Faſt. is eating and drinking eſpecially meant: for thereby is the body more then by any other thing nouriſhed and refreſhed; nothing ſo abſolutely neceſſary thereto as food. Beſides, the generall nature and matter of a Faſt conſiſteth therein eſpecially: and therefore the Scripture moſt vſually expreſſeth abſtinence from food when it mentioneth a faſt.
Faſt (ſaith Eſter) and neither eate nor drinke.
                        Eſt. 4. 16. 
                        Let neither man nor beaſt (ſaith the King of Niniueh, when he proclaimed a Faſt) taſte any thing: let them not feede, nor drinke water.
                        Ion. 3. 7. Of Dauid it is alſo noted, that in the day of his Faſt,2 Sam. 12. 16. 
                        he would not eate meate.
                     
                     
                        Queſt.
                        Whether it be lawful to eate or drinke in the time of a Faſt. May not then in the time of a religious Faſt any nouriſhment be taken?
                     
                        Anſw. To reſolue this doubt, reſpect muſt be had both to the continuance of a Faſt, and alſo to the perſons that faſt.
                     1 There may be occaſions to continue a Faſt longer then the ſtrength of man is able to endure; and then ſo much food as may preſerue nature, and maintaine health and ſtrength, may, and muſt be taken: yet with theſe two prouiſoes.
                     1 That the food which in ſuch a caſe is taken, be not delicate, but rather courſe; ſo it be agreeable to his nature that taketh it.
                     2 That it be not taken vnto fulneſſe, but rather ſo ſparingly, as the perſon which faſteth may feele the want of foode; ſo as no more then needs muſt for the preſeruation of health and ſtrength is to be taken.
                     Such a Faſt as this,Dan. 9. 3. was that which Daniel kept for three weekes; and with the forenamed prouiſoes was it obſerued.
                     2 Among the perſons that keepe a Faſt, ſome may be of a good &amp; ſtrong conſtitution, and able without weakning their bodies to abſtaine from all ſuſtenance a day or two: theſe ought altogether to abſtaine, though they feele ſome want of foode. Others are ſo weake, as if their ſtomacks be cleane empty of all food, they are vnfit for any good duty: yea, if long they continue empty, they may be ſo weakened as hardly they will recouer their ſtrength againe. Many women when they are breeding and with child, cannot leaue reatching (as we ſpeake) after they riſe in a morning, till they haue eaten ſomething. Foure and twenty houres faſting may make many aged and ſickly perſons ſo weake, as they cannot be able with comfort to performe any religious duty. Such perſons therefore may ſo farre forth refreſh themſelues as their neede and weakeneſſe require. Though we haue no example of this caſe propounded in Scipture, yet wee haue a ſufficient ground for it, namely, that rule which both in the olde and alſo in the new Teſtament is laide downe in theſe words; I will haue mercy, and not ſacrifice. To Faſt,
                        Hoſe. 6. 6. is not more then Sacrifice,

                     1 AS foode is moſt eſpecially to be forborne in a Religious Faſt,1. Foode. What things are to be forborne in a Faſt. being principally intended vnder this phraſe of refreſhing bodies; ſo are ſundry other things alſo

                        ending thereto implied, as theſe which follow:
                     2 Sleepe,
                        2. Sleepe. which is intimated in the direction that the Prophet giueth in theſe words, Lie all night in ſack-cloth,
                        
                           Ioel 1. 13. Non ſolum ab eius ſed à cunctis illecebris abſtinendum. Hieron. whereby is intended that either they ſhould all night forbeare ſleep, or elſe that by wearing ſackcloth, they ſhould be kept from ouermuch ſleepe (wherein they that lie in fine linnen and ſoft beds, are prone to exceede.) Thus
Dauid to keepe himſelfe from ſleepe in the time of his faſt, would not come into a bed,2 Sam. 12. 16. but lay all night vpon the earth. Though thoſe particular rites of wearing ſackcloth, lying on the earth, ſitting vp all night, with the like, be not ouerſtrictly to be vrged, or vſed, yet the equity of them is ſtill to be obſerued; which is, that in the day of a Faſt we ſleepe leſſe, and riſe ſooner then at other times, that ſo the body may be ſomewhat the more afflicted thereby, and that the more time may be gained for religious duties. If ſome ſleepe be not forborne, the want of foode will not be ſo much felt, nor the body ſo humbled and afflicted as it ſhould be.
                     3 Soft and braue apparell:
                        3 Braue apparell. The Lord expreſly commanded his people,Exod. 34. 4, 5. 
                        to put off their coſtly raiment; and ſo they did in the day of their humiliation. It is recorded and commended,Ion. 3. 6. that the King of Niniueh in the day of a faſt
laide his robe from him.
                        2 Sam. 12. 20. When the time of Dauids Faſt was ended, then he changed his apparell: whereby is intimated, that in his Faſt he did not weare ſuch apparrell as at other times he did. If Kings thus laide aſide their royall apparrell, much more muſt others lay aſide braue and coſtly apparrell. The rite of putting on ſackcloth which the Iewes vſed, ſheweth that braue apparrell may not be worne; no not ſuch as at others times is lawfull. Our Gentry vpon meere faſhion retaine ſome ſhadow hereof, in that for the time of Lent they lay aſide all light colours, and goe in blacke.
                     4 Matrimoniall beneuolence.
                        4 Matrimoniall beneuolence. The exception which the Apoſtle maketh of faſting and prayer,1 Cor. 7. 5. when he diſſwadeth man and wife from defrauding one another, ſheweth that this in the time of a Faſt muſt be forborne: which alſo
Ioel implieth, by bidding the Bridegroome and Bride goe out of their Chamber.

                        Leu. 16. 29. 31, &amp; 23, 32. it implieth, that as a Sabbath it muſt be ſanctified, and no manner of worke done therein:

                        6 All pleaſant things. The Iewes who at other times were wont to vſe ſweete ſmelling oile, wherewith they annointed their head, and other parts o

                     To conclude, ſuch forbearance of refreſhing the body is required in the time of a Faſt, as may be felt, and by the ſence thereof the body ſomething afflicted: ſo did the Iewes, as may be gathered out of this their expoſtulation,
Wherefore haue we faſted, and afflicted our ſoule?
                        Iſa. 58. 3. which though it were the expoſtulation of hypocrites, yet of ſuch as in outward religious exerciſes imitated the Saints. But more directly is this proued by a like phraſe which

                        Col. 2 25▪ Expounded. This is ſuch a ſuperſtitious practiſe, as the Apoſtle reproueth vnder this phraſe of not ſparing the body.

                        1 Cor. 9 27. Expounded. There is a great difference betwixt not ſparing the body and keeping the body vnder. By not ſparing the body (to omit the ſuperſtitious conceit, which they whom the Apoſtle reproueth, had of pleaſing God thereby) he meaneth ſuch an exceſſe as weakeneth nature: but by keeping vnder his body, he meaneth ſuch a moderate forbearance of the things wherein the body delighted, as the corrupt fleſh, euen the old man might be ſubdued, and not pampered. In the former place a mans outward body is weakned, and the corrupt fleſh not ſubdued: in the latter place, the corrupt fleſh is tamed, and yet the ſtrength of a mans outward body not impaired. What contradiction then is there betwixt theſe two places?

                           II. Point. What is ment by ſeaſonable abſtinence. 
                        Seaſonable, in the deſcription of a religious Faſt, hath reſpect to the time of a Faſt: vnder which circumſtance both the occaſion, and alſo the continuance of a Faſt is compriſed. For that is ſeaſonably and in
due time done, which on iuſt occaſion is one, and which is ſo far done as may ſtand with a mans abilitie to endure, without deſtroying or impairing nature. Heere therefore we will conſider:
                     1 The occaſions of a Faſt.
                     2 The continuance thereof.
                     The occaſions of faſting muſt be (as we heard§. 99. before of extraordinary prayer) extraordinary, as when any extraordinary bleſſing is with-held, or taken away from vs: or any iudgement is threatned, or inflicted: or elſe when any grieuous ſinne is committed, for which there is cauſe to feare Gods heauie vengeance, with the like: and that either in our owne behalfe, or in the behalfe of others.
                     The bleſſing for which Annah faſted as wel as prayed,1 Sam. 1. 7. (for the text ſaith, ſhee did not eate) though it were but a priuate and temporary bleſſing, was extraordinary. So alſo that deliuerance for obtaining whereof,2 Cro. 20. 3. 
                        Iehoſaphat with the Iewes in his time,Eſt. 4. 16. 17. and Eſther and Mordecai with the Iewes in their time faſted, was extraordinary.
                     
                     The ſpirituall bleſſing for which the Church faſted when they ſent forth Apoſtles and ordained Elders,Act. 13. 3, and 14. 23. was,
extraordinary.
                     
                     The iudgement which was denounced againſt Niniueh (for preuenting whereof they faſted)Ion. 3. 7. Ioel. 1. 13. 14. and which was inflicted on Iſrael in Ioels time (for remouing whereof they alſo faſted) were extraordinary.
                     
                     The ſinne, for committing whereof, the Iſraelites faſted in Samuels time,1 Sam. 7. 4, 6. was extraordinary.
                     
                     The occaſions which moued Ezra,

                        Nehemiah and

                     §. 105. Of ſet times of Faſt.
                     THis is to bee noted againſt the ſuperſtitious weekly, monethly, quarterly, and yearely ſet faſts of Papiſts, who hauing no reſpect at al to the occaſion, inioyne people for conſcience ſake to faſt euery fryday, the eues before moſt of their holydayes, euery ember weeke and the time of Lent: at which times may fall out occaſions of reioycing. So common a practiſe of faſting without due reſpect had to the occaſion, maketh it loſe the due reſpect thereof.
                     
                        Obiect.
                        Zac. 8. 19. Expounded. The Iewes in the time of the captiuity had many ſet faſts in the yeare, as in the fourth, fift, ſeuenth, and tenth monethes.
                     
                        Anſw. They had ſpeciall and extraordinary occaſions both to faſt in thoſe moneths, and alſo to continue euery yeare to faſt in them ſo long as they did faſt. The occaſions were theſe: In theIer. 52. 4. tenth month Ieruſalem began to bee besieged, which was the firſt ſigne of that horrible vengance, that God by his Prophets had oft threatned to take of the rebellious Iewes. In theIer. 52. 6, 7. fourth moneth, the City was broken vp, whereby God openly ſhewed that now he had forſaken that Citie. In theIer. 52. 12, 13. fift moneth were not onely the Kings houſe and all the houſes of Ieruſalem, but alſo the houſe of God, that famous Temple which Salomon built, burnt downe to the ground, whereby the Lord declared that now his preſence, and protection was cleane taken away from them. In the2 King. 25. 25. ſeuenth month Gedaliah was ſlaine.Ier. 41. 1. This Gedaliah was appointed a Gouernour ouer that remnant of people which were left in Iudea, after the greater ſort of them were caried away captiues: now when he was ſlaine, euen all that remnant alſo was ſcattered, none remained; which was a further declaration of the extent of Gods wrath againſt them. Thus God many waies manifeſting his indignation againſt the Iewes, they had iuſt cauſe euen with faſting to humble themſelues all thoſe times: and becauſe they felt the ſmart of euery one of thoſe ſtrokes all the time of of the captiuity, they continued (as there was iuſt cauſe) their times of humiliation by faſting, till the captiuity was ended: but after that Gods fauourable countenance was turned to them again,Zac. 8, 19. they left off thoſe daies of faſt. Now the Papiſts can ſhew no ſuch cauſe of their forenamed ſet faſts: ſo as the example of the Iewes can bee no warrant to them.
                     2 Obiect. The ſame daies are obſerued in our Church for faſting dayes.
                     
                        Anſw. They are retained by vs onely as politicke and ciuill faſts, for the better preſeruation of fleſh, but maintained by them as religious faſts.
                  
                  
                     §. 106. Of the continuance of a Faſt.
                     TO know the right and due continuance of a faſt, it is needfull to put difference betwixt a faſt in whole, and
in part. A faſt in whole is ſuch a faſt as wee haue deſcribed, wherein there is an vtter abſtinence (except in caſe of neceſſity) from refreſhing the body with any food at all. A faſt in part, is when a man taketh ſome nouriſhment in the daies of his faſt:What is a faſt in part. and this is when there is occaſion of faſting longer then a man is able to forbeare all manner of ſuſtenance: for example a man of great vſe, whoſe death is a very great loſſe, is ſtrucken with a dangerous ſickneſſe, and lieth betwixt hope and feare ſome weeke or more: their iſſue being vnknowne, his friends earneſtly deſirous of his life, continue to faſt and pray euery day, till they ſee what iſſue the Lord will giue: now becauſe of the long continuance of ſuch a faſt, euery day they take one meale to preſerue the ſtrength of their body. The like faſt may bee vſed when a City is beſieged, and the inhabitants incloſed by their enemies on euery ſide. Now becauſe ſuch a faſt may be long indured, and the occaſion thereof may bee longer or ſhorter, no ſet time can be ſet for the continuance of it, but onely that it bee ordered according to the occaſion that God giueth.
                     As for the other more true and proper Faſt, a Faſt in whole, which was deſcribed *§. 102. &amp; 103. before, and whereof we doe now eſpecially ſpeake; a whole naturall day is a fitte time for the continuance of it.A naturall da
                              •
                            is a fit time for a proper Faſt. Our naturall day conſiſteth of foure and twenty houres: Of leſſe continuance a Religious Faſt (as I take it) may not be. In the Law the day of a faſt is called a Sabbath:Leu. 16. 31. the time of a Sabbath muſt therefore bee allotted vnto it: now a Sabbath containeth the ſeuenth part of a weeke, which is foure and twenty houres. Where Eſther inioyneth a Faſt of three daies,Eſt. 4. 16. ſhee mentioneth the night as well as the daies, ſhewing thereby, that the night muſt bee reckoned as a part of that day wherein a Faſt is obſerued.
                     In the ſpace of foure and twenty houres onely one ordinary meale is forborne, (the Faſt beginning at the end of one meale, and when the Faſt is ended, another meale being taken:) but leſſe then one meale in a Faſt cannot be forborne. This therefore is the ſhorteſt time, which yet will appeare to be long enough, if a Faſt be rightly and duly obſerued. For the laſt meale which is taken before a Faſt, ought to be a very moderate &amp; ſpare meale; ſo moderate, as ſo ſoone as it is taken, wee may without heauineſſe, drowſineſſe, and dulneſſe, ſet ouſelues to examination, meditation, conference, reading, prayer, and ſuch like religious exerciſes in priuate, as a preparation vnto the more ſolemne exerciſes to bee performed in a Faſt. Moſt meet it is that this preparation be in the euening, and the Faſt then to beginne. From euen to euen (ſaith the Law) ſhall ye celebrate your Sabbath:
                        Leu. 23. 32. meaning a Faſt. So as immediatly after a ſpare ſupper, all ſeruile workes of our calling laide aſide, the forenamed preparation is to beginne, and continue ſo long as conueniently wee can ſit vp, euen longer and later then on other daies we vſe to goe to bed. Then after ſome ſleepe is taken, in the next morning riſing ſooner then ordinarily we vſe to doe, after ſome renewing of our preparation, the reſt of the time euen till the foure &amp; twenty houres from the beginning of our euening preparation, be ended, is to be ſpent in the ſolemne exerciſes of Religion appertaining to a Faſt. If a Faſt be continued, as hath been before ſet downe, two whole dayes, it is as much as our weake nature can wel endure, without impairing the health and ſtrength of our body.
                     
                        Obiect. Paul,
                        Acts 27. 33. and they which were in the ſhip with him, faſted foureteene dayes, and tooke nothing.
                     
                     
                        Anſw. They are ſaid to faſt,In what ſence Paul and his company are ſaid to faſt 14. dayes. becauſe being all that time in danger of their liues, much perplexed, and buſied in ſauing the ſhip, they had no leaſure to take one ordinary meale: ſo as that was not a propper Faſt, but yet an extraordinary abſtinence, no more taken then was neceſſary to preſerue life: and therefore Paul fearing leſt ſome of them might faint, exhorted them to take ſome meate, adding this reaſon, This is for your health, as for this phraſe (They tooke nothing) it is but an hyperbolicall ſpeech.
                     2 Obiect. Eſther,
                        Eſther 4. 16. and the Iewes in her time faſted three dayes and three nights together.
                     
                     
                        Anſw. The Iewes liued vnder an hotter climate then we doe, and in that reſpect could endure to faſt longer then wee which liue in the Northerne and colder part of the world.
                  
                  
                     §. 107. Of Supplication, the moſt principall end of a Religious Faſt.
                     THe laſt point noted in the deſcription of a Religious Faſt, concerneth thoſe duties of Religion which are the end of a Faſt, and for our better fitting, whereunto a Faſt is vndertaken. The moſt principall duty of all is ſupplication: whereunto as ſubordinate to prayer, may be added
Examination, humiliation, mortification, &amp;c. Becauſe extraordinary prayer is the moſt eſpeciall end of faſting, I haue annexed faſting as an helpe thereunto: for which I haue good warrant by the vſuall tenour of the Scripture, which ioineth Faſting and Prayer together. When the Prophets ſaw cauſe to vſe extraordinary Prayer, they were wont to call vpon the people to faſt.Ioel 2. 15. 17. 
                        Sanctifie a Faſt (ſaith Ioel) when vpon an extraordinary occaſion he preſcribed a forme of prayer for them to vſe. In like manner ſaith Ezra;
                        Ezr. 8. 21. 
                        I proclaimed a Faſt, that we might ſeeke of God a right way, &amp;c. And accordingly they obſerued his direction, and ioined faſting and prayer together: for ſaith he, We faſted, and be ſought our God,
                        Verſe 23. 
                        &amp;c. So ſaith Nehemiah of himſelfe,Nehe. 1. 4. 
                        I faſted and prayed. And of the Church in the new Teſtament, it is ſaid, when they ſent forth Paul and
Barnabas,
                        Acts 13. 3. they faſted and prayed: and when they ordained Elders,Acts 14. 23. they Prayed and faſted.
                     
                     Great reaſon there is to adde Faſting to extraordinary Prayer:Why Faſting is added to Prayer. for when there is an extraordinary occaſion of Prayer, extraordinary ardency and continuance in prayer muſt be vſed, as was§. 95. before ſhewed. Now faſting doth quicken our ſpirits,1 Faſting is an helpe to Prayer. and rowſe vp our dull hearts, and ſo both ſharpen our prayers, adding life and efficacy vnto them, and alſo make vs able to hold out, and continue the longer in Prayer. For as fulneſſe maketh a man drowſie in body, and heauy in ſpirit, (ſo as he can neither pray ardently, nor continue long in prayer) ſo faſting maketh him freſh and cheerefull both in body and ſpirit. Note the moſt ardent &amp; long continued ſupplications in Scripture,2 Faſting is a ſigne of our earneſt deſire. and you ſhall find them ſupported by faſting. Beſides, as faſting is an helpe to prayer, ſo it is a teſtification of our vehement &amp; earneſt deſire of obtaining that which we pray for: for by our voluntary abſtaining from ordinary foode, and other delights of our body, we ſhew that we preferre the thing which we pray for, before them.
                     The other duties which were reckoned vp among the ends of a Religious Faſt, as Examination, humiliation, and
mortification, (as was before noted) ſubordinate vnto Prayer, and helpefull thereunto: In that faſting therefore is vſed for the better performance of them, in the vſe of them it proueth to be a further helpe for prayer; which will the better appeare, if diſtinctly we conſider how faſting maketh vs more fit to performe theſe duties.

                     COncerning Examination of our ſelues,Examination needfull for Prayer. we cannot be ignorant, but that when any needfull extraordinary bleſſing is to be obtained, or any iudgement to be preuented or remoued, it is very requiſite to ſearch whether there be not any ſinne in vs which may make our prayers to be reiected and not regarded. That which the Lord ſaid of the Army of Iſrael in Ioſuahs time,Ioſ. 7. 11. 12. may be applied to particular perſons, namely, that if they did not ſearch, and find out, and take away the execrable, and excommunicate among them, the Lord would not be with them any more:Lam. 3. 40, 41. wherefore the Prophet exhorteth firſt to ſearch, and trie our wayes, and turne to the Lord; and then to lift vp our hearts with our hands vnto God in the Heauens.
                     
                     Now by faſting,How faſting is an helpe to examination. we both gaine more time for examination, (euen that time which otherwiſe would be ſpent in ſleeping, eating, drinking, and other like things, which in the day of a Faſt are forborne) and alſo make ourſelues more fit thereto, in that our ſpirits are cheered, and our hearts rowſed vp thereby, as was noted§. 104. before. This the Saints well knew, and therefore were wont in the dayes of their Faſt to enter into a ſerious and ſolemne examination of their owne, and of others ſinnes. Reade the Prayer that Ezra made in the day of his Faſt,Ezr. 9. 6, &amp;c. and in it you may obſerue how he ſearcheth out the ſinnes of the Iewes in his time, which had prouoked the wrath of God, and ſetteth them in order before God. So did the Leuites in that Faſt which was kept in Nehemiahs time.Nehe. 9. 16, &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 109. Of Humiliation, a third end of Faſting.
                     COncerning Humiliation,
                        Humiliation needfull for Prayer. it is well knowne, that they which looke to preuaile by Prayer with God, muſt come before him with an humbled heart. To him (ſaith the Lord) will I looke that is poore,
                        Iſa. 66. 2. How faſting is an helpe to humiliation. 
                        and of a contrite ſpirit. Now by faſting wee manifeſt our vnworthineſſe of the leaſt of Gods bleſſings, and ſo teſtifie great humiliation; yea, the very rites of a Faſt are a means to humble the ſoule ſomewhat the more. By laying aſide our beſt apparell, by our voluntary abſtinence from Gods Creatures, by forbearing ſome of our ordinary ſleepe, and by refuſing in other reſpects to refreſh our bodies, we ſhew that we thinke our ſelues vnworthy of any outward delights, yea of the leaſt crumme of bread, and drop of water. In old time they were wont to weareIon. 3. 5. Dan. 9. 3. ſack-cloth in the time of a Faſt, to ſhew that the worſt cloathing was good enough: andNeh 9. 1. Ioſ. 7. 6. to lay duſt vpon their heads, to ſhew that they thought themſelues more worthy to be vnder the ground, then to tread vpon it. Againe, when we faſt, becauſe God is diſpleaſed for our ſinne, and as a token of his diſpleaſure, inflicteth ſome iudgement vpon vs, we doe not only manifeſt our great griefe for diſpleaſing God, but alſo after an holy manner take vengeance of our ſelues, which is an eſpeciall point of humiliation, commended in the Corinthians.2. Cor. 7. 11.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 110. Of Mortification, a fourth end of faſting.
                     COncerning Mortification,
                        Mortification needfull for prayer.
                        §. 20. It hath been before ſhewed, that the luſts of the fleſh, and the wanton affections therof, are a great hindrance to feruent prayer: being as birdlime to the fethers of a fowle, which keepe it from mounting high. Yea it is more cleare then needs be proued, that they continually fight againſt the ſpirit, and are a meanes to quench it; ſo as the ſpirit is kept from making requeſts for vs, ſo long as luſt boyleth and domineereth in vs. Neceſſarie it is therefore, that in this reſpect the body be beaten downe, and brought into ſubiection. But faſting is an eſpeciall meanes to ſubdue our wanton fleſh,How faſting is an helpe to mortification. and corrupt luſts: for as pampering our bodies addeth ſtrength to the olde man, ſo faſting mortifieth it, and keepeth it downe. The Apoſtle, where he implieth,1. Cor. 7. 5. that while man and wife giue themſelues to faſting and prayer, may the better abſtaine, intimateth that by faſting and prayer luſt is ſubdued.
                  
                  
                     §. 111. Of faſting now vnder the New Teſtament.
                     BY that which hath hitherto beene deliuered in explication of a religious Faſt, we may well conclude, that it is a warrantable, commendable and needfull exerciſe:
Warrantable, becauſe commended: Commendable, becauſe the practiſe thereof is commended: Needfull, becauſe of the ends§. 107. &amp;c. before Propounded. It is therefore an exerciſe carefully and conſcionably to be obſerued of vs.
                     
                        Obiect. It is no where commanded in the new Teſtament.
                     
                        Anſw. 1.The commā
                           dement of faſting is of perpetuall force. The Apoſtles and Churches practiſe thereof in the time of the Goſpell, ſheweth that the Commandements of the old Teſtament concerning faſting, were not as other ceremoniall ordinances, of force only for the time of the law, but of perpetuall vſe ſo long as a Church ſhould remaine on earth.
                     2 The anſwere which Chriſt gaue to the Phariſies in defence of his Diſciples not faſting,Matth. 9. 15. in theſe words, The daies will come when the Bridegrome ſhall bee taken from them, and then ſhall they faſt, hath the force of a precept.
                     3 The ſame occaſions, and the ſame ends of faſting which were vnder the Law, ſtill remaine vnder the Goſpell (what theſe occaſions and ends are, hath bin ſhewed
§. 104. 107, &amp;c. before) wherefore, as we make conſcience of other duties, ſo let vs make conſcience of this alſo. As God doth manifeſt his iuſt indignation againſt vs, by threatning or inflicting any iudgement, or by with-holding, or taking away any bleſſing, ſo let vs manifeſt our true humiliation by faſting.Motiues to fast. Faſting added to prayer, maketh it extraordinarily powerfull, as appeareth by theſe three euidences.
                     1 By the great and wonderfull things which the Saints haue obtained thereby.1. Sam. 1. 5. &amp;c. 
                        Annah, though the Lord had made her barren, obtained a childe. The Iewes in
Iehoſaphats time obtained an extraordinary victorie.2. Chro. 20. 3, 22. And in Eſthers time a memorable preſeruation. Many like examples are noted in the Scripture.Eſther 4. 16.
                     
                     2 By that reſpect which God hath had to the faſting of Hypocrites:1. King. 21. 29. as is noted in the example of Ahab. If God were moued to ſtay a temporall iudgement threatned againſt a wicked man vpon his temporary humiliation by faſting, what will he not doe vpon the true humiliation of his faithfull children by faſting?
                     3 By that inſtance which Chriſt giueth of caſting out ſuch a kinde of Diuell by faſting and prayer,Matth. 17. 21. as by no other meanes can be caſt out. If an extraordidary Diuell may be caſt out by faſting and prayer, when he hath gotten poſſeſſion in a man, how much more may diabolicall paſſions and corruptions bee caſt out of a man by this meanes? No maruell that the Diuell ſo much preuaileth euery where, ſeeing this ſoueraigne meanes of weakening his power is ſo much neglected. We in this Land haue done our ſelues much wrong by neglect of this duty:
                     That which§. 115. afterwards ſhall be ſpoken of motiues to extraordinary prayer, and of our negligence therein, may in particular be applied to this helpe of prayer.
                  
                  
                     §. 112. Of Vowes.
                     THe other helps to extraordinary prayer is making of Vowes, which is both expreſly commanded, (Pſalm
                              •
                           
                         76. 11.) and alſo hath been by Gods children much practiſed.
Iaakob vowed a vow to God as he was going to his vnkle Laban,
                        Vowes an helpe to extraordinary prayer. (Gen. 28. 20. 21.) So did Annah (1 Sam. 1. 11)
Dauid (Pſal. 132. 2.) and many other Saints.
                     
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Ea proprie intelligenda eſt oratio, quam facimus ad votum, id eſt

                        Vowing is ſo proper to praying that the Greek word which in the new Teſtament moſt vſually ſignifieth praier, ſeemeth to be drawen from a vow.
                     1 To vow in praying doth much ſharpen our praiers, and make vs more eagerly call vpon God.
                     2 It doth manifeſt a very earneſt deſire of obtaining the thing we deſire: it argueth that we are willing to doe any thing, or part with any thing to obtaine it.
                     3 It doth as it were ſet a tutor ouer vs, to call vpon vs to perform our duty, to check vs when we are ſlack therein, and to keepe vs within that compaſſe that we haue ſet vnto our ſelues.
                     
                        Obiect. This was a thing belonging rather to the pedagogy of the Iewes, then to the ripe age of Chriſtians vnder the Goſpell.
                     
                        Anſw. Indeede becauſe the Church before Chriſts time was but in her non-age, in compariſon of that manage whereunto ſince Chriſts time it is growne, vowes were then more vſuall, then they are now. Yea at that time their voluntary vowes were parts of Gods worſhip, as other rites and cerimonies which were inioyned them of God were, whereunto we are not now ſo ſtrictly bound. So as there is ſome difference betwixt the time of the Law, and of the Goſpell in this reſpect. Yet notwithſtanding are not all vowes, and the vſe of them vtterly aboliſhed: they ſtill remaine lawfull and helpfull vnto vs.
                     For though wee are attained to a riper age then that of the Iewes, yet are we not come to a perfect age▪ wee are but children in regard of that meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt,
                        Eph. 4. 13. whereunto the ſpirits of iuſt and per
                           •
                        ect men in Heauen attaine. So as ſtill we haue need of helps: and among other helps, this of vowes is needful, and may be profitable vnto vs.
                  
                  
                     §. 113. Of the things which concur to the making of a lawfull vow.
                     VVHerefore for our direction in vſing this helpe,Directions for making vows. wee muſt obſerue what things concur to the making of a good and lawfull vowe: euen thoſe foure things whereby euery thing is made good, the foure cauſes, which are, 1. The maker of the vow. 2. The matter of it. 3. The manner thereof. 4. The end.
                     1 The perſon who maketh a vow,1 Who may make a vowe. muſt be both of vnderſtanding, and alſo of power to make it. In vowing we haue to doe with God, who muſt not be dallied withall, nor mocked. They who deale with him muſt well conceiue what they doe; (wherefore Ideots, children, frenſie perſons, and ſuch like, are not fit to vow) they muſt alſo haue an ability to performe what they vow (wherefore ſuch as are vnder the authority and command of others may not vow, in ſuch caſes wherein their Gouernours may croſſe their vow.)
                     2 The thing vowed,2 What may be vowed. muſt bee both lawfull and poſſible.Acts 23. 18. To vow to commit a ſinne (as the Iewes vowed to kill Paul) is a double iniquity. To vowe that which we are not able to doe (as many who vow perpetuall continency) is a plaine mockery.
                     3 In regard of the manner,3 How a vow is to be made. a vow muſt be made freely and maturely. A vowe is a kinde of ſpirituall offering, it muſt therefore bee a free will offering, or elſePſal. 119. 18. can it not be acceptable to God. It is not meete for Parents to force their children, or any man to force another to make a vowe.
                     A vow is alſo a matter of weight, it muſt bee made in iudgement vpon due conſideration and deliberation, not raſhly or vnaduiſedly.Iudg. 11. 30, 31. Herein did Ieptha (though otherwiſe a good man) offend. Raſh vowes canſe either much miſcheefe, or much repentance.In vouendo ſtultus in reddendo impius. Hier Ibid.
                     
                     4 There be two maine ends of a vow.4 Why a vowe is to be made. One to preuent or redreſſe ſome ſinne (as for a man which is of a flexible diſpoſition, and much drawne away by vaine company to vow againſt ſuch and ſuch company: or for a man that hath a light braine, and is ſoone made drunken with ſtrong beere and wine, to vow againſt theſe.) The other to hold a man cloſe to ſome duty; as to vow euery day to reade ſo much, or ſo much of the Scripture, morning and euening to pray, to ſanctifie the Sabbath, &amp;c.
                     
                        Obiect. Wee are bound to performe all theſe things, though they bee not vowed.
                     
                        Anſw. We vow thoſe things which wee are otherwiſe bound to doe, in regard of our owne dulneſſe and backwardnes, that ſo we may by a double bond (one of Gods law, the other of our vow) be the more prouoked to doe them. Iaakobs vow made to God in theſe words: (The Lord ſhall be my God:) was a duty commanded. Gen. 28. 21.
                     A vow being thus made, wee are bound in conſcience to performe it: c 
                        Pay therefore that which thou haſt vowed. It is better that thou ſhouldeſt not vow, then that thou ſhouldeſt vow and not pay it.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 114. Of publike and priuate Faſts and vowes.
                     AS the occaſions of faſting and vowing are publike or priuate, ſo muſt they bee done publikly or priuately. Becauſe there was a publike iudgement on the land,Ioel. 2. 14. 
                        Ioel the Prophet called the people to a publike faſt.Ezra 10. 3. So likewiſe
Ezra cauſed a publike vow to to made of all the people.
                        Annahs occaſion was priuate and particular, accordingly was her f faſt and g vow.
                     A publike faſt or vow muſt bee appointed by publike authority (as were all the publike faſts and vowes recorded and commended in the Scripture) and performed by all that are vnder their authority, &amp; in their dominion who command it. When Iehoſaphat proclaimed a publike faſt, it is noted that they came out of all the Cities of Iudah: and when Ioſiah made a publike vow and Couenant with the Lord: He cauſed all that were found in Iudah, and Beaiamine to ſtand to it.
                     
                     The Miniſters of the word, ought to put the Magiſtrates in minde of theſe extraordinary exerciſes, when there is occaſion (as Ioel did) The Magiſtrate ought to appoint them: and Magiſtrates, Miniſters, People, and all obſerue them: and for the better obſeruing thereof, aſſemble together in publike places, and vſe the publike Miniſtery of the word: for which wee haue a notable patterne of the Iewes in the time of Nehemiah: for when the people were all aſſembled together, with faſting to make a ſolemne vowe:Neh. 9 3. the Leuites read in the book of the Law of the Lord their God, one fourth part of the day, and another fourth part of the day they confeſſed, and worſhipped the Lord their God. Theſe two fourth parts, were all the time that paſſed betwixt the morning and euening Sacrifice, namely from nine to three.
                     As for priuate faſts &amp; vowes if they be performed in a family, the Maſter thereof who is a King, Prieſt, and Prophet in his owne houſe, hath the ordering therof. But euery particular Chriſtian hath liberty in ſecret by himſelfe, to vſe theſe extraordinary exerciſes as he ſeeth iuſt cauſe; if at leaſt he be not vnder the power &amp; cōmand of another, to whom his time and ſeruice is due. When Magiſtrates are negligent in appointing thoſe publike exerciſes in their ſeaſons, priuate Chriſtians may for their parts make ſome ſupply thereof in their families, or at leaſt in ſecret by themſelues.
                  
                  
                     §. 115. Of Motiues to extraordinary Prayer.
                     VVEighty motiues there be to ſtirre vs vp to extraordinary Prayer.
                     1 It ſheweth that we goe along with Gods good guiding prouidence: that we obſerue Gods iudgements, and are moued with them, and take notice of his bleſſings, and are accordingly affected: that as the iudgements of God are greater, ſo our ſupplication and humiliation more extraordinary: as his bleſſings more needefull and ſcanty, ſo our petitions more earneſt and feruent: and as they are more excellent and plentifull, ſo our thankeſgiuing more ſolemne. They who content themſelues with their ordinary manner of praying, (like mil-horſes going round in their vſuall tracke) and neuer take any occaſion of extraordinary prayer, but thinke all is well, becauſe they are not Atheiſts, which neuer call vpon God, plainely diſcouer how little they regard Gods dealing with them. If they did, as God dealt extraordinarily with them, ſo would they extraordinarily carry themſelues towards God.
                     2 Extraordinary prayer is extraordinarily powerfull and effectuall, either for preuenting and remouing great iudgements, or for obtaining and recouering ſingular bleſſings, as we haue§. 99. before ſhewed.
                     3 It is an extraordinary honour done vnto God: the more we ſtoop vnder his iudgements, and the more highly we account his bleſſings and fauours, the more we glorifie God.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 116. Of the neglect of extraordinary Prayer.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         IF we well obſerue Gods dealing with vs,
 and the ſeuerall occaſions of extraordinary prayer from time to time affoorded vnto vs, wee cannot but condemne our ſelues for neglect of this duty, and extraordinarily humble our ſelues, euen becauſe wee haue not extraordinarily prayed, as iuſt occaſion hath oftentimes beene giuen vnto vs. How many iudgements hath God laid vpon vs yeere after yeere? ſtrange ſickneſſes, extraordinary fiers, froſts, inundations of waters, droughts when raine was needefull, tempeſtuous and rainy weather, when calme and faire weather would haue beene very acceptable, with the like. Among other publike iudgements, I cannot let paſſe that ſore, heauy, grieuous ſtroke, whereby the life of that worthy admirable Prince was taken away, vpon the ſixt of Nouember 1612. Had extraordinary prayer in time been vſed, no doubt but many of theſe iudgements might haue beene preuented. Would there be ſo many inſufficient, idle, careleſſe, corrupt Miniſters, as are in many places? or would the diligence and paines of many learned and faithfull Miniſters be ſo fruitleſſe as they are, if extraordinary prayer were more vſed? What may be the reaſon that many marriages, offices, callings, and the like matters of moment are ſo vnproſperous? that many Chriſtians long lie vnder ſore and grieuous temptations and croſſes, that other iudgements are inflicted vpon their families, their children, yea, and their owne perſons, and many needfull bleſſings denied? Surely this duty is not vſed as it ought to be. Let it therefore more frequently and conſcionably be vſed.
                     Hitherto of the ſeuerall kinds of Prayer.
                  
               
               
                  
                  THE THIRD PART.
                  The time of Prayer.
                  
                     §. 117. Of praying alwayes.
                     
                        THe next branch is concerning the Time,
                        How wee may pray alwayes. which by the Apoſtle is limited with no diſtinct time, but indefinitely ſet downe vnder this generall particle Alwayes.
                     
                     If this circumſtance be ſimply taken without any limitation, it implieth not only a great inconuenience, but alſo a plaine impoſſibility. For is it not inconuenient that we ſhould attend wholly and onely on prayer; and ſo neglect the Word, Sacraments, and other duties of piety? yea, alſo all duties of iuſtice, and charity to our neighbours?

                        Salomons ſeruants ſaid to ſtand euer, or continually before him. So wee ſay of a Student that is much in his ſtudy, he is alwayes or continually there: ſo of a woman that tarrieth much at home, ſhee is euer in her houſe. But more diſtinctly to ſhew the meaning of this circumſtance,
                     1 It is to be taken incluſiuely, including euery part of time, and excluding none, neither day nor night, whether wee are alone or in company, in the middeſt of buſineſſe, or free from buſineſſe, at what time ſoeuer occaſion is giuen, we muſt pray.
                     2 It ſignifieth a daily and conſtant performing of this holy exerciſe: thus this ſacrifice which vnder the Law was conſtantly offered vp euery day, morning and euening, is ſaid to bee offered vpEx. 29. 38, 42 
                        continually, and called a

                     3 It implieth that beſides our ordinary and ſet times of prayer, we muſt take extraordinary occaſions to call vpon God.
                     4 It intimateth a continuall preparation of the heart alwayes, euen euery moment readie to be lift, vp to God in prayer. As the ayre with the leaſt blaſt of winde is moued, and a feather with the leaſt motion of aire is lifted vp, ſo muſt our hearts in petition and thankſgiuing.
                     Thus this phraſe being rightly taken, affordeth no iuſt ground to thoſe heretikes called

                     §. 118. Of praying euery day.
                     1 CHriſtians ought to haue ſet times of prayer euery day.1 Euery day pray. This is implied in the fourth Petition, where this day, is expreſſed, to ſhew that the next day wee muſt pray againe, and euery day ſay, this day. This is alſo prefigured by that continual burnt offering, wherof I ſpake§. 117. before.
Pſal. 96. 2. 
                        Dauid exhorteth hereunto ſaying, Sing vnto the Lord, praiſe his name from day to day: and promiſeth to performe as much himſelfe, ſaying,&amp; 145. 2. 
                        I will bleſſe thee daily, and praiſe thy name for euer and euer.
                     
                     1 We daily ſtand in need of Gods bleſſings,Reaſons. both of the continuance of his old bleſſings, and alſo of beſtowing new bleſſings. Needfull it is therefore, that euery day we ſhould pray for them.
                     2 The graces of God in vs are ſubiect euery day to decay: now prayer is as food, whereby thoſe graces are preſerued, reuiued and increaſed. Daily wee take bodily food? Daily alſo let vs vſe this ſpirituall food.
                     3 Euery day we are ſubiect to aſſaults of our ſpirituall enemies, who are neuer wearied: and vnto many dangers of ſoule and bodie. But prayer is the moſt principall meanes to keepe vs ſafe from all.
                     There are alſo like reaſons for thankeſgiuing alwayes, day after day.Pſal. 68. 19. For God ladeth vs daily with his bleſsings: euery day, yea euery houre, both Gods former bleſſings are continued and renewed, and alſo new bleſſings beſtowed. Is thy life, health, libertie, or any other bleſſing, matter of thankſgiuing this day? Then if the ſame be renewed the next day, it is alſo matter of thankſgiuing the next day, and ſo day after day. Continuall matter of thankſgiuing, requireth continuall thankſgiuing.
                  
                  
                     §. 119. Of the fitteſt times for daily prayer.
                     
                        Queſt. HOw often a day is it meete we ſhould pray,Singulis diebus qui amplius non poteſt, faltem duabus vicibus oret mane ſcil. &amp; veſpere Concil. Conſtantinop. 6. cap. 7. Vide Cryſ. exhort. ad matutinas, &amp; veſp. orationes. Hom. 14. in Rom. 8. and at what times?
                     
                        Anſw. Not to ſpeake of ſudden eiaculations, which we ſhall touch by and by, it is meete that ſolemne prayers be made at leaſt twice a day. The fitteſt time for which is the morning and the euening. In the morning to praiſe God for our reſt the night before, and to craue his protection ouer vs, and his bleſſing vpon vs the day following. In the euening to praiſe him for the bleſſings receiued that day, and to craue his protection in the night when we ſleepe. Thus ſhall this ſpirituall ſacrifice of theOſe. 14. 3. 
                        Calues of our lippes be anſwerable to thatNum. 28. 4. daily outward ſacrifice of lambes, vnder the Law, whereof one was to be offered in the morning, the other in the euening. This timePſal. 92. 2. 
                        Dauid preſcribeth ſaying to God, It is a good thing to declare thy louing kindneſſe in the morning, and thy truth at night: yea&amp; 55. 17. 
                        Dauid went further, and ſaith, Euening and morning, and at noone will I pray. Which times it is likely that Daniel obſerued, for hee prayedDan. 6. 10. 
                        three times a day. Dauid yet further ſaith,Pſal. 119. 164. 
                        Seuen times a day doe I praiſe thee. But that I take to be meant of ſom extraordinary occaſions, becauſe his ordinary courſe was ſet downe before: or elſe aſet number for an vncertaine, ſeuen times, that is, oftentimes, and ſo meant of ſudden prayers.
                     Againſt this doe they offend, who neuer pray but at Church vpon Sabbath daies, or ſome other ſolemne daies, or if euer at home, onely then when ſome extraordinary occaſion is offered, as if they, or ſome of theirs be ſicke, if they feare ſome iudgement, or want ſome great bleſſing. What hope can ſuch haue to bee heard in their great needs, who otherwiſe would not call vpon God.
                  
                  
                     §. 120. Of conſtant keeping our ſet times of prayer.
                     2 SVch ſet times as are appointed for daily prayer,
                        2 Be conſtant in keeping ſet times. 
                        would conſtantly be kept. Elſe we doe not in euery ſeaſon alwayes without intermiſſion pray. The Lord ſaith of the fore named daily ſacrifice vnder the Law,Num. 28. 2: 
                        Yee ſhall obſerue to offer vnto me in their due ſeaſon mine offering, &amp;c. implying thereby, that they ſhould not faile nor miſſe of their due ſeaſon and accuſtomed time. Feare of death could not turne Daniel from his courſe: he prayed (notwithſtanding the Kings contrary decree) three times a day, as he did afore-time. This phraſe, as afore-time, implieth a conſtant courſe.
                     Great reaſon there is that we ſhould be conſtant, for
                     1 There is in vs a naturall proaneneſſe to waxe cold and faint in prayer.Reaſons. Water is not more proane to be cold, nor an heauy weight to fall downward, then we to waxe dull in this heauenly exerciſe. Wherefore as fire muſt conſtantly be put vnder water to keep it hot, and a weight muſt cōſtantly be wound vp to keep it from the ground, ſo muſt wee by conſtant prayer quicken vp our ſoules, and keepe them aloft.
                     2 The Diuel wil take great aduantage by once omitting it, and moue vs to omit it againe and againe; and ſo by degrees bring vs to an vtter 
                           •
                        iſ-vſe of it. Aſſuredly they which once omit their courſe of praying, ſhall finde the next time they come to pray, a more then vſuall dulneſſe thereto: which is partly thorow Gods iuſt iudgement, who thus puniſheth our neglect of this duty, partly thorow our naturall indiſpoſition thereto, and partly thorow the ſubtilty and malice of the Diuell, who thus ſeeketh to diuert vs cleane from our courſe.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 121. Of Canonicall houres.
                     
                        Queſt. VVHat difference is there betwixt this conſtant obſeruing ſet times, and Popiſh canonicall houres of prayers?
                     
                        Anſw.
                        Reaſons why Canonicall houres vnlawfull. 1. Their canonicall houres are grounded on ſuperſtition, as the reaſons which they themſelues alledge doe ſhew: for they appoint ſeuen houres of prayer for euery day.1. They are grounded on ſuperſtition. The firſt before day, becauſe Chriſt was then taken. The ſecond at the firſt houre, becauſe then hee was led to Pilat. The third at the third houre, becauſe then he was mocked. The fourth at the ſixt houre: becauſe then he was crucified. The fift at the ninth houre, becauſe then he gaue vp the Ghoſt. The ſixt in the euening, becauſe then hee was taken from the Croſſe. The ſeuenth in the completory, becauſe then he was buried. Theſe reaſons are ſuperſtitious, no good grounds. In other houres wee may finde other things done to Chriſt, as his bringing to Annas, to Caiphas, to Herod, his accuſations, ſcourging, &amp;c. and ſo make euery houre a canonicall houre for prayer. Wee haue better reaſons, as I ſhewed§. 120. before.
                     2 They place Religion in the very obſeruing of ſet times.2. Religion is placed in them. We doe not ſo: for we ſet not the ſame continuance for all, ſome may hold out an houre, ſame halfe, ſome but a quarter, ſome longer, ſome ſhorter. Neither doe we tye all to the ſame houre. A ſtrong able perſon that vſeth to riſe betimes, may pray at three or foure, or fiue of the clock in the morning, as ſoone as heriſeth. Another that is weake, and notable to riſe ſo ſoone, may when he can riſe.
                     3 They content themſelues with ſaying ouer ſo many prayers as may bee in ſuch a ſet time,3. They are ſtinted with time. though their hearts goe not with one word: for their prayers being in lattin, many cannot vnderſtand what they pray. We account ſuch prayers meere lip-labour. Neither doe wee meaſure our prayers by a ſet time, but wee meaſure our time by our deuotion and affection in prayer.
                     4 They appropriate their canonicall houres to eccleſiaſticall perſons onely,4 They are appropriated to certaine perſons. as Prieſts, Munks, Nunnes, &amp;c. Wee make our dayly times of prayer common to all Chriſtians: becauſe prayer is a duty belonging to all.
                     5 Some of their houres,5 They are vnſeaſonable. namely, at mid-night, are very vnſeaſonable to be ordinarily and daily performed: they are neither meet for the health of mā (that being the moſt ſeaſonable time to reſt in) nor for the worſhippe of God, which muſt needes at that time bee drouſily performed. Our times are the moſt ſeaſonable that may be.
                     6 Their houres are ſo many,6 Too much time is ſpent in them. that other neceſſary buſineſſes muſt needs be omitted: they affoord not time enough for Miniſters to ſtudy, and performe other miniſteriall functions belonging to their place. Our times are ſuch as may well bee affoorded to prayer, by thoſe that haue the moſt and greateſt imployments.
                     7 They are ſo ſuperſtitious on the one ſide in keeping their number and ſtinted houres,7 Too great ſtrictneſſe in fulfilling the time. and on the other ſide ſo careleſſe in the due time, that they giue tollerations to obſerue all the ſeuen houres in one part of the day, and none in the other part. Wee affood no ſuch tollerations. Euening prayer would not be performed in the morning, though a double taske of the Word may bee read at once.

                         LEt vs bee carefull and conſcionable as in ſetting vnto our ſelues fit times of prayer,
 ſo alſo in keeping of them. Many ſuffer euery ſmall occaſion, the leaſt buſines, a matter of little gaine, yea, a matter of pleaſure and ſport to interrupt their courſe: They are farre fromDan. 6. 10. 
                        Daniels minde. If they could truly feele and diſcerne the ſweetneſſe and comfort of prayer, they would bee otherwiſe minded then they are. For our parts let vs preferre it to all things, and let all things whatſoeuer giue place to it. Thus ſhall wee manifeſt our reuerend and high account of God, of his worſhippe, and of his bleſſing. If in the morning neceſſary buſineſſe bee to be performed, let vs riſe ſo much the ſooner to pray, rather loſe of our ſleepe then omit that exerciſe: ſo at night, if extraordinary buſineſſe hold thee vp late, ſit vp a little the longer for prayer ſake. They who conſcionably and conſtantly vſe it, think not themſelues ſafe in a morning, till they haue commended themſelues by prayer to God: they are much diſquieted, if by any occaſion it bee omitted: ſome dare not eate, nor drinke in a morning till they haue prayed, nor at euen goe to bed till they haue prayed againe. A good religious minde.

                        or whereſoeuer we are, we muſt pray. If we goe about any religious exerciſe, any work of our calling, any duty of loue, any honeſt &amp; lawful recreation, we muſt pray: when we goe to meat, to ſleep, to walk abroad, to ride a iorney pray, at home, in the field, in our Inne, in priſon, on the ſea, in a forren country, in time of proſperity, in time of aduerſity, in ſeaſon, at our times appointed, out of ſeaſon, at other times, night and day pray. So much implieth the Apoſtle1. Tim. 2. 8. where he willeth men to pray in euery place, and theſe phraſes, alwaies, at al times, cōtinually, without ceaſing, imply as much.
                     
                         1 Prayer ſanctifieth euery thing,Reaſons. euery place, as wee ſhewed in the fift branch of the neceſſitie of prayer.

 and that euery where in euery thing we meete with many croſſes and vexations. The means of making things proſper, and of preuenting croſſes is rarely vſed. No maruell alſo that God oft with-holdeth many good things from vs; due praiſe is not giuen for ſuch good things as he giueth.

                        and prepared to be lift vp to God: euen when we haue not opportunity of time and place to vtter any prayer with our mouthes, in heart we muſt pray, asExod. 14. 5. Nehem. 2. 4. 
                        Moſes and Nehemiah. This is that mentall and ſudden prayer whereof I ſpake before.

                        but vnto ſeuentie times ſeuen times: euen euery moment, as the leaſt occaſion is offered, and ſo often as the Spirit of God moueth. If we obſerue our ſelues or others to ſtand in need of any bleſſing, inſtantly let our hearts be lift vp to God: when any of Gods bleſſings come to our minde by the relation of others, by our owne cogitation, by any preſent fruition, or by any other meanes, preſently (in heart at leaſt) bleſſe God: learne of the little birds, which lift vp their bils to heauen, ſo oft as they take a little water into them.

It well beſeemeth them: how can it then but well beſeeme vs? wee muſt endeauor to be like them: onely heere lieth a difference betwixt them and vs, that all teares are wiped away from their eyes, ſo as they haue not ſuch matter of ſupplication as we haue: we muſt mixe petition and thankſgiuing together: ſo giue thankes alwayes, as wee make ſupplication
                        alwayes: for to both theſe parts of prayer is this extent to be applied: one muſt not exclude another: neither muſt either of them exclude any other duetie.
                  
               
               
                  THE FOVRTH PART.
                  The Ground of Prayer.
                  
                     §. 126. Of the meaning of this phraſe in the Spirit.
                     
                        THe third general branch concerning praier, is the ground from whence it ariſeth, and that is the Spirit. Pray in the Spirit, ſaith the Apoſtle. Some heere vnderſtand the ſpirit of man, which is the ſoule and heart of a man: and ſo is this phraſe vſed,1. Cor. 14. 15. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . where the Apoſtle ſaith,
I will pray with the Spirit, or in the Spirit. Others vnderſtand the Spirit of God, which is the holy Ghoſt: and ſo is this phraſe vſed,Iude v. 20. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        f where the Apoſtle Iude ſaith, Pray in the holy Ghoſt,
                        Rom. 8. 26. and where Saint Paul ſaith, The Spirit maketh requeſt for vs. I take it, that they which exclude either of theſe, come ſhort of the Apoſtles meaning: for I doubt not but he heere intendeth both the Spirit of God and alſo the ſpirit of man, ſure I am that both may ſtand together, yea that both do alwaies concurre together and cannot be ſeuered: for without the holy Spirit of God, man cannot pray in his ſpirit and heart: and whenſoeuer the Spirit of God helpeth vs to pray, hee ſtirreth vp our ſpirits and hearts to pray. The ſpirit of man is that eſpeciall place where the Spirit of God hath his reſidencie.
                     This clauſe then affordeth vnto vs theſe two inſtructions.
                     
                         1 True prayer is a worke of the holy Spirit of God, and commeth from his motion.
                     2 Prayer framed by the Spirit of God, floweth out of the very ſpirit and heart of a man.
                  
                  
                     §. 127. Of the worke of the Spirit in prayer.
                     FOr the firſt,
                           Doct. 1. Praier a work of the holy Ghoſt. note what the Prophet ſaith in Gods name to Ieruſalem,
                        Zach. 12. 10. 
                        I will powre vpon them the ſpirit of ſupplications. He calleth the gifts of prayer the ſpirit of ſupplications, becauſe it is Gods Spirit which worketh in vs this gift, and inableth vs to call vpon God: in a like reſpect, Saint Paul vſeth this phraſe,2. Cor. 4. 13. 
                        The Spirit of faith. More plainely is this point proued, by that phraſe which Saint Iude vſeth,Iude v. 20. 
                        Praying in the holy Ghoſt: but moſt euidently byRom 8. 26, 27. Expounded. Saint Paul, who layeth it downe, firſt affirmatiuely, ſaying, The Spirit helpeth our infirmities, and maketh interceſsion for vs: then negatiuely, ſaying, Wee know not what to pray, &amp;c. What may the Apoſtle meane by this phraſe, The Spirit it ſelfe maketh interceſsion? Doth the holy Ghoſt truely and properly pray for vs, as Chriſt our High Prieſt and Mediator, or as one of vs for another? Noe verily: for then ſhould the holy Ghoſt bee our Mediator (which was one of Arrius his hereſies) an office which is neuer attributed to him, but appropriated to Chriſt:1. Tim. 2. 5. 
                        For there is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and man, the man Chriſt Ieſus Beſides, then alſo ſhould God make requeſt to God; for the holy Ghoſt is God, but not man alſo, as Chriſt was. The meaning then of the Apoſtle muſt needs bee this, that the Spirit of God ſtirreth vs vp to pray, quickning, and putting life into our dead and dull ſpirits, yea inwardly, as it were, ſuggeſteth vnto vs, and infuſeth into vs ſuch deſires, ſuch ſighes &amp; grones, yea and ſuch words, as are acceptable to God, which for the truth and ſincer

                        e of them, for the vehemencie and ardencie of them, for the power and efficacie of them are

                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        vnutterable: they pierce thorow the very heauens, and enter vnto the glorious Throne of Gods grace, and there make a loud crie in the eares of the Almightie. Therefore
Rom. 8. 27. in the next verſe the Apoſtle addeth, he that ſearcheth the hearts (that is, God the ſearcher of all hearts) knoweth what is the minde of the Spirit (that is, what deſires, what ſighes and groanes, what prayers proceed from the work of his Spirit, being ſtirred vp thereby in our ſpirits) for Gods Spirit informeth, and inſtructeth our ſpirits to make prayers to God, according to the will of God, which otherwiſe were moſt impoſſible for vs to doe: we neither could tell what to aske, nor how to aske. Thus plainely and clearely we ſee, that true prayer commeth from the motion and worke of Gods Spirit: which may yet further be confirmed by comparing, Gal. 4. 6. with Rom. 8. 15. in that it is ſaid, the Spirit in our hearts crieth Abba Father: in this, by the Spirit we crie Abba Father.
                     
                     The reaſons why thus the Spirit prayeth,Why needfull that the holy Ghoſt helpe vs to pray. yea why it is needfull that the Spirit ſhould pray, and ſo we pray in the Spirit, are theſe.
                     1 In regard of our naturall eſtate,Reaſons. we haue no abilitie at all to pray: a dead man can as wel craue help of another man, as a naturall man in faith craue ſuccour of God.
2. Cor. 3. 5. 
                        Wee are not ſufficient of our ſelues, to thinke any thing as of our ſelues. Can we then be ſufficient of our ſelues to pray aright?
                     
                     2 In our regenerate eſtate wee are no longer able to doe any good thing, then the Spirit helpeth and aſſiſteth vs. Though once we be inabled by the Spirit to pray aright, vet if the Spirit leaue vs and continue not in vs his powerfull worke, all our abilitie is gone (as a wheele which is turned about with an hand, if the hand be taken away, the wheele will ſoone ſtand ſtill) it is needfull that vnto the firſt grace, following grace be added: for man after he is regenerate, ſtill needeth the preſent, effectuall, continual worke of Gods holy Spirit. It is therefore ſaid,
Philip. 1. 6. 
                        He that hath begunne a good worke in you, will performe it vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt.
                     
                     3 Though we knew how to pray, yet would not our prayer be acceptable to God, except it came from his Spirit:
Rom. 8. 17. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . it is attributed as a proper worke to the Spirit, that he maketh interceſſion according to the will of God (that is, ſo as is pleaſing and acceptable to God) for as God knoweth the meaning of the Spirit, ſo the Spirit knoweth the will of God.
                     1 Heere note how the whole Trinitie hath a worke in this holy exerciſe of prayer.Rom. 8. 26. The holy Ghoſt frameth our requeſts.Reu. 8. 3. The Son offereth them vp vnto his Father.
Rom. 8. 27. The Father accepteth them thus framed, and offered vp.
                     2 Note the reaſon, why the prayers of the Saints are ſo acceptable, and auaileable, why they pierce thorow the clouds, and haue acceſſe to Gods throne: they are the groanes of Gods Spirit: not that the Spirit groaneth, but that our ſpirits are made to groane by Gods Spirit.
                     3 Note what an admirable gift, the gift of prayer is, a ſingular gift, peculiar and proper to the Saints, who haue the Spirit of God: if1. Cor. 12. 3. 
                        no man can ſay that Ieſus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt, ſurely no man can call vpon God, as his Father, but by the Spirit of God.Rom. 8. 15. 
                        We haue therefore
receiued the Spirit of adoption, whereby we crie Abba Father.
                     
                     4 Note how we may know whether Gods Spirit bee in vs, and whether we be Gods ſonnes or no: euen by the Spirit of prayer: I meane not an outward formall vttering of words, but true prayer comming from the heart.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 128. Of the meanes to pray aright in the Spirit.
                     THey who deſire to pray aright, ſo as their prayer ſhould be acceptable to God, muſt,
                     1 Labour for Gods ſanctifying ſpirit, which is gotten by the miniſtery of the word, as was ſet foorth byActs 10. 44. thoſe extraordinary gifts which God beſtowed on Chriſtians while they were hearing the word preached: &amp; asGal. 3. 2. Saint
Paul with great emphaſis affirmeth, ſaying, receiued ye the the ſpirit by the workes of the law, or by hearing of faith? that is, aſſuredly by hearing the Goſpell (which is the word of faith) preached ye receiued the ſpirit: in which reſpect the preaching of the Goſpell is called,2 Cor. 3. 8

If ſacrifices were offered vp with any other fire, that fire was counted&amp; 10. 1, &amp;c. ſtrange, and the ſacrifices no whit acceptable, but abominable to the Lord: the heauenly fire whereby our ſpirituall ſacrifices of praier muſt be offered vp, is that holy ſpirit which commeth out from God: he carrieth the very image of God: we muſt therefore

                        giue vnto God that which is Gods.

                        reſiſting the ſpirit, thorow our rebellion: hence is it that many of the Saints are ſo dull, and vntoward to this exerciſe: by their ſecurity and carnality they haue grieued Gods ſpirit, and he hath withdrawne his helpe and aſſiſtance.
                     Many hearing that the ſpirit maketh requeſt for vs, wil be ready wholly to giue ouer this duty vnto the worke of the ſpirit, and ſo neuer rowſe vp themſelues, but ſay, when the ſpirit pleaſe it will make requeſt for me. Theſe grieue the ſpirit, becauſe they ſtirre not vp the gift thereof.

                           Doct. 2. Praier wroght by Gods Spirit, commeth out of mans ſpirit. that Prayer framed by the Spirit of God, floweth out of the very ſpirit and heart of a man; it is alſo cleare byRom. 8. 26. the forenamed place, The ſpirit maketh interceſsion with groanes, &amp;c. Now groanes proceede from the heart, and ſpirit, not from the tongue and lips: but more expreſlyGal. 4. 6. the Apoſtle ſaith, that the ſpirit which crieth Abba Father, is ſent into our hearts. Hence it is that they which pray in the ſpirit, are ſaid1 Sam. 1. 15. Pſal. 62. 8. to powre out their ſoule and their heart to God. The Virgin
Mary (who without all queſtion praiſed God in the ſpirit) ſaith,Luk. 1. 46, 47 
                        My ſoule magnifieth the Lord, my ſpirit reioyceth in God.
                     
                     1 The heart of man is,Reaſons. as it were, Gods chaire of ſtate, whereunto no creature can come: it is proper to God alone; it is his Pallace wherein he moſt delighteth: wherefore Gods Spirit maketh his aboade there, and ſtirreth that vp to pray.
                     2 The heart is a fountaine whence commeth euery thing, good or euill: wherefore the Spirit doth eſpecially purifie and ſanctifie it. Yea, the heart is as a Queene, ſhee hath a command of all the powers of the ſoule, and parts of the body; and therefore the Spirit giueth this gift of prayer to her.
                  
                  
                     §. 130. Of diſcerning when we pray in the Spirit.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 HEreby may we iudge whether the Spirit of God be in vs,
 and moue vs to pray or no. If our prayer come but from the teeth, though it be neuer ſo well framed in regard of the forme of words, and though our geſture be neuer ſo ſeemely, ſauouring of much reuerence and humility, yet all is nothing: the Spirit of God hath no part in this worke, if thy ſpirit pray not. Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt the manner of perſwading God and man. Man may be moued with faire ſpeeches, inticing words, eloquent phraſes, (Act. 12. 21, 22 as the people of Tyrus and Sidon with Herods eloquent Oration) but all the eloquence in the World is no more to God then the lowing of an Oxe, or the howling of a dogge, if it come not from the ſpirit. Hearty and vpright prayer is the beſt rhetoricke to moue God withall.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 What matter of humiliation is miniſtred vnto moſt,
 euen of them that are accounted the beſt? how often doe ſuch as heare others pray, fall downe on their knees, and ſo ſeeme to pray, and yet know not what hath beene prayed? Their thoughts haue beene vpon other matters. Some manifeſt as much in that, when the prayer is ended, they teſtifie no aſſent thereunto by ſaying, Amen. Yea, how often doe they who vtter the prayer (Miniſters in the Church, other perſons in other places) tumble ouer words with their mouthes, when their hearts are wandring, ſo as little aſſent of ſpirit, if any at all hath been giuen to their owne words? Can ſuch ſacrifices be acceptable to God? let vs be humbled for that which is paſt; and be more watchfull ouer our hearts for the time to come.

                     §. 131. Of watching vnto Prayer.
                     
                        THE fourth generall branch, is concerning the helpe of Prayer, Which is watchfulneſſe, noted in this clauſe,
                     Watch thereunto.]
                     The originall word according to the proper notation of it,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . ſignifieth to awake and abſtaine from ſleepe: it is properly attributed to the body, metaphorically and by way of reſemblance vnto the ſoule. Sleepe of the body, is ſuch a binding of outward ſences, as they can not exerciſe their ſeuerall functions: as the eye cannot ſee, the eare cannot heare, and ſo in the reſt: Watchfulneſſe is contrary hereunto, a keeping of the ſences free and looſe, ſo as readily they are able to performe their functions. Thus by way of reſemblance, when the ſoule is ſo poſſeſſed and ouercome with ſecurity and ſpirituall ſenceleſneſſe, as it cannot performe the duties of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, it is ſaid to be aſleepe: when it rowſeth vp it ſelfe, and caſteth away ſecurity, it is ſaid to watch; in this ſence ſaith the Apoſtle,1 Theſ. 5. 6. 
                        Let vs not ſleepe as doe other, but watch.
                     
                     Moſt reſtraine this watching vnto prayer,
                        What watchfulnes is here meant. to the inward ſpirituall watchfulneſſe of the ſoule: which I will not denie to be here eſpecially meant. But yet I cannot thinke that the watchfulneſſe of the body is excluded: for if the body be drowſie, the mind cannot be watchfull. The Apoſtle by this clauſe would rowſe vp both body &amp; ſoule vnto prayer. The watchfulneſſe of the body alone is nothing: It is the ſpirit, the vprightneſſe, ardency, and cheerefulneſſe of it, which maketh prayer to be acceptable to God, as we heard before.
                  
                  
                     §. 131. Of Popiſh Night vigils.
                     RIght watching vnto Prayer, is to be noted againſt the
Night-vigils of Papiſts, who place an extraordinary great point of Religion and deuotion in the obſeruing of them.Bellarmin. de bonis oper. lib. 1 cap. 11. Vſually they make three vigils, one at the cloſing vp of the day, and beginning of the night. Another at mid-night. The third at the cloſing vp of the night, and beginning of the day. In ſome places they haue more vigils, as ſome are more ſuperſtitious then others. Theſe vigils they ground on this and other like places, where we are commanded to watch vnto Prayer; as if they who waked to mumble ouer and ouer a few ſet prayers, whilſt others ſlept, obſerued this precept. For in the outward babbling of a few prayers, ſtandeth the greateſt part of their Religion. I wot well thoſe night prayers are oft performed ſo drowſily, and ſleepily, that it were better they were faſt aſleepe in their beds, then betwixt ſleeping and waking ſo to mocke God.

                        Dauid ſaith, that at mid-night he would riſe to giue thankes vnto God.
                     
                        Anſw. He did not make it a law euery mid-night to riſe, but occaſion being offered, hee would euen then riſe. And ſo ought euery Chriſtian to doe: for this is compriſed vnder that particle Alwayes, or in euery ſeaſon. Thus
Acts 16. 25. 
                        Paul and Silas being in priſon, Prayed at midnight, and
&amp; 20. 7. 
                        Paul afterward preached vntill mid-night: Yet did they not ordinarily vſe this, nor appoint it a Law vnto themſelues, or others. Extraordinary actions are not to be enioyned as ordinary things: then ſhould wee ſpend euery day in faſting.
                     I might further ſhew many differences betwixt Dauid, paul, Silas, their praying at midnight, &amp; papiſts praiers, but of this I ſpake§. 121. before in the point of Canonicall houres,

                     Theſe erre many waies.
                     1 In that they preſcribe certaine ſet times for Chriſts comming,Mat. 24. 36. 
                        Whereas no man knoweth it.
                     
                     2 In that they conceit hee ſhall come in the night, which is vncertaine, for he may come as well in the day time for ough any man knoweth. Indeed Chriſt ſpeaking of his comming to iudgement, ſaith,Luke 17. 34. in that night: but this word Night is taken ſenecdochically for day or night, a part for the whole:&amp; v. 20. a little before he calleth it the day, when the ſonne of man ſhall be reuealed, and implyeth, that when he commeth, men ſhall be eating, drinking, buying, ſelling, planting, building, which are works of the day time. Yet I will not deny but that he may come in the night time.
                     3 In that they imagine that they which are aſleepe when Chriſt commeth, cannot be well prepared to meet him. Whereas in truth a man that hath repented him of his ſinnes, and with faithful prayer commendeth himſelfe to God, and ſo goeth to ſleep, is as fit in his ſleepe to be awaked and taken vp to iudgement, as if he were in the act of prayer.
                     4 In that they interpret that precept of Chriſt,Mat. 24. 42. 
                        wake, of bodily waking: and watching here in this text of bodily watching. But waking and watching in theſe and ſuch like places, imply not onely a keeping of the eyes, but of the heart alſo awake &amp; attentiue vpon that which is done.
                  
                  
                     §. 133 Of watching both in body and in Spirit.
                     TO let all theſe &amp; other like erronious conceits paſſe, &amp; to returne to our matter. As outward watchfulneſſe of the body is nothing acceptable to God, vnleſſe the ſoule alſo be watchfull, ſo the ſoule cannot poſſibly bee watchfull, vnleſſe it haue the helpe of the bodies watchfulneſſe: for the parts of the body are thoſe
Organa. inſtruments whereby the powers of the ſoule are exerciſed. Wherefore both muſt bee ioyned together, as eaſily may bee gathered out of Chriſts charge to his Diſciples,Mat. 26. 41. 
                        Watch and pray. That hee ſpeaketh of bodily watchfulneſſe is cleare, for he found them aſleepe, and therefore ſaid, Watch. As cleare alſo it is that he ſpeaketh of ſpirituall watchfulneſſe becauſe he inferreth this clauſe,
that yee enter not into temptation: it is not bodily watchfnlneſſe alone that can keepe vs from temptation. Yet further this metaphor of watching hath a large extent: for it is a military word, and the Apoſtle ſtill holdeth on like a wiſe Captaine to inſtruct Chriſtian ſouldiers what to doe. In time of warre there are certaine appointed continually to watch in ſome ſconce, watch-towre, or other like eminent place, where they muſt rowſe vp themſelues throughly that they ſleepe not, and not onely remaine awake, but prie and view vp and downe euery where and diſcry what may be hurtfull or helpfull to the army. So as watching vnto prayer implyeth a diligent obſeruing of all ſuch things as may help vs or hinder vs therein. In this ſence the Apoſtle ſaith of Miniſters, that they
Heb. 13. 17 
                        watch for the ſoules of their people, that is, carefully obſerue what may make to the good, or what tend to the hurt of their ſoules.
                     I might out of the full meaning of this metaphor collect many particular duties, and diſtinctly handle them all, but for breuity ſake I will drawe all to one doctrine, which is this,
                     
                        For the better performance of prayer,
                        
                           Doct. Both body &amp; ſoule to bee rowſed vp to Prayer. 
                        both body and ſpirit of him who prayeth, is to be rowſed vp, and kept from inward and outward drouſineſſe, and due obſeruance is to bee made of all things helpfull or hurtfull thereunto. To this purpoſe tend thoſe many exhortations which by Chriſt &amp; his Diciples are made to watch. When Chriſt warned his Diciples of his laſtMar. 13. 37. comming, andMat. 26. 41 when he was in his agony he bid them watch SoCol. 4. 2 
                        Paul, ſo1 Pet. 4. 7. 
                        Peter. To this purpoſe alſo tendeth that patheticall ſpeech of Dauid,
                        Pſal. 57. 8 
                        Awake my glory, awake Viol and Harpe, I will awake early.

                     BOth body &amp; ſpirit are carefully to be rowſed vp,
                           Reaſon. Cauſes of bodily drowſineſſe. becauſe of our naturall pronenes to drowſines, and heauineſſe in body &amp; ſpirit, two cauſes there be which cauſe bodily ſlumbering. Firſt debility and weakneſſe of ſenſes, whence it is that young children and old folkes, are more proane to ſlumbering then luſty ſtrong perſons. Secondly, abundance of vapours which ſtupifie the ſenſes: for fulneſſe of meat and drinke, whence thoſe vapors ariſe,Cauſes of ſpirituall drowſineſſe. make men ſluggiſh and ſleepy. Anſwerable there be two cauſes which procure ſpirituall ſleepineſſe and ſlumbring.
                     1 Weakeneſſe of the fleſh (as Chriſt implieth when he checketh his Diſciples for their ſluggiſhneſſe,1 Weakeneſſe of the fleſh. ſaying,
Mat. 26. 41. 
                        The fleſh is weake:) whereby it commeth to paſſe that by nature we are exceeding drowſie &amp; dull, as to all good and godly exerciſes, ſo eſpecially to Prayer, which is the beſt of all. I neede not further proue this then by appealing to the conſcience of euery one that vſe this holy exerciſe. Many are loath to goe about it: many when they are at it, fall faſt aſleepe, asActs 20. 9. 
                        Eutichus. I haue heard this direction preſcribed, when one cannot ſleepe; Say thy prayers, and thou ſhalt ſleepe: it is commonly the direction of prophane perſons, ſpoken of ſluggiſh prayers, (for if a man pray in the ſpirit with that earneſtneſſe which hee ought, it will rather keepe him the longer from ſleepe) but yet it ſheweth that men are commonly dull and drowſie in Prayer. Our ſpirituall ſluggiſhneſſe maketh our hearts heauy, and our eyes ſleepy: Againe, our bodily ſluggiſhneſſe maketh our ſpirits more dull.

Theſe adde much vnto our naturall dulneſſe and drowſineſſe; ſo as in theſe two reſpects there is great neede of watchfulneſſe.
                  
                  
                     §. 135. Of going drowſily to Prayer.

                           Vſe 1. Such as goe drowſily to prayer taxed. who going to prayer, are ſo farre from rowſing vp their ſpirits and bodies, that they doe, as it may ſeeme, purpoſely ſet themſelues to ſleepe: ſome compoſe themſelues to ſuch geſtures as make them ſleepe, they hang downe their heads, and leane them vpon their armes or hands: they ſit vpon ſeates, or vpon the ground, they cloſe their eyes, &amp;c: Some neuer pray till they goe to bed, and ſo ſleepe preuenteth them: ſome againe come immediatly from their pots and platters, or from their worldly affaires and buſineſſes, and preſently goe to prayers, without any premeditation or cogitation of what buſineſſe they haue in hand. With what deuotion can ſuch prayers be performed? Is this to watch vnto prayer? The truth is, that ſuch doe but mocke God.

 and for a better performance of this duty of watchfulneſſe, obſerue theſe few directions following.
                     In regard of the body,1 Chooſe fit times. firſt chooſe ſuch times as are freeſt from drowſineſſe; theſe are mornings: for our bodies hauing reſted all the night, and by reſt being refreſhed, are the more free, ready, and cheerefull to prayer. Schollers find it the fitteſt times for their ſtudies:Aurora muſis amica, and ſo may Chriſtians, if they obſerue a difference of times, find it fitteſt for their prayer. If for prayer ſake we riſe the ſooner, we watch vnto Prayer.
                     
                     2 Conſidering that it is ſo needefull that we pray at euening,2 Rowſe vp thy ſelfe. which is a drowſie time, rowſe vp thy ſelfe before prayer; goe not to it halfe ſleeping, halfe waking.

Chriſt hauing giuen a warning to take heede of ſurfetting, drunkenneſſe, and cares of this World, inferreth this exhortation,
Watch and pray: otherwiſe we cannot well watch &amp; pray. Wherefore ſaith Saint Paul;
                        1 Theſ. 5, 6. 
                        Let vs watch and be ſober. And Saint Peter,
                        1 Pet. 4. 7. 
                        Be ſober and watching in prayer. Who eate for prayer ſake ſomewhat the more ſparingly, doe
watch vnto prayer.
                     
                     In regard of the ſoule,
                     1 Take heed it be not too much diſtracted with worldly thoughts,4 Auoid diſtractions.
                        Mat. 13. 22. 
                        Cares of this World choake the Word, much more will they choake the ſpirit of Prayer. Hee that remembring the time of prayer, disburdeneth his ſoule hereof, Watcheth vnto prayer.
                     
                     2 Moſt eſpecially be watchfull againſt ſinne,5 Take heede of ſinne. which (as§. 20. hath beene ſhewed before) like birdlime wil ſo cling the feathers of the ſoule, that it cannot flie vp to Heauen. Nothing more dulleth the heart of man then ſinne. He that yeeldeth thereto can hardly recouer himſelfe, and reuiue his ſpirit againe in a long time.2 Sam. 12, 1, &amp;c. It was three quarters of a yeere before Dauid was throughly recouered after his great fall; for his child was borne before, and an extraordinary meanes was vſed to recouer him, the Prophet
Nathan was ſent vnto him.
                     It was an admirable and extraordinary thing that Peter was ſo ſoone recouered. Sinnes doe grieue the ſpirit, and quench his good gift in vs: the Spirit being grieued and prouoked to withdraw his preſence, will not returne againe with a wet finger. Eſpecially be watchfull againſt ſuch ſinnes as by nature thou art moſt proane vnto: for in them eſpecially will Satan moſt attempt thee when thou art going to prayer. If thou beeſt giuen to luſt, make a couenant with thine eye not to caſt it vpon a ſtrange woman: auoide wanton company, gariſh attire, fulneſſe of bread, and whatſoeuer may prouoke luſt: ſo in anger, voluptuouſneſſe, couetouſneſſe, &amp;c. This is an excellent point of wiſdome, and argueth great watchfulneſſe vnto prayer, if for prayer ſake it be done.
                     3 Take notice of Gods mercies and iudgements,6 Obſerue Gods dealing with thee. of his bleſſings beſtowed on thee, and of thy wants, of the eſtate of others, and of other points concerning the matter of prayer. Reade alſo ſome part of Gods Word before Prayer: Thus ſhalt thou come furniſhed to Prayer. This is alſo to watch vnto Prayer.
                     
                     Many complaine of their vntoward performance of this heauenly duty, but obſerue not the reaſon thereof, which is this, They watch not vnto Prayer.

                     IN the laſt place is added an eſpeciall meanes of obtaining our deſire by Prayer, which is Perſeuerance. Pray (ſaith the Apoſtle) watching thereunto with all perſeuerance.
                     
                     
                        Perſeuerance is an holding out to doe a thing till it be accompliſhed.
                        What perſeuerance is. The vniuerſall particle All, addeth emphaſis therevnto, and ſheweth that it muſt be a patient, conſtant, vnwearied, continued holding out.

The originall word is by the learned of that tongue attributed to hunting dogges, which will not ceaſe following the game till they haue got it. A fit reſemblance, if the rule of a ſimilitude be obſerued, which is to hold cloſe to the point in hand. To perſeuere then in prayer is, with long patience to continue conſtantly in calling vpon God, and not waxe weary, or giue ouer till he heare vs. This is manifeſted two waies,
                     1 By often praying for one &amp; the ſame thing. As2 Cor. 12. 8. 
                        Paul prayed thrice againſt a temptation, that is oftentimes.
                     2 By a long holding out at one time,Gen. 32. 24. as Iaakob wreſtled a whole night with the Angell, and would not let him goe till he had bleſſed him.

                        Queſt. 1. HOw oft or how long muſt we perſeuere in prayer,How long we muſt perſeuer before we giue ouer?
                     
                        Anſw. Noe certaine and ſtint time can bee limitted. Some things are continually to bee prayed for as long as we liue, namely thoſe things which wee ſtand in neede of all the daies of our life, whether they reſpect ſoule or body, and thoſe things which ſhall not bee accompliſhed ſo long as wee liue; as a ioyfull reſurrection and eternall ſaluation. Theſe are to bee prayed for in our ordinary prayers continually. Other things for which eſpecially perſeuerance in prayer is needfull, require a more particular and preſent anſwere of God, as a temptation, ſickneſſe, or any diſtreſſe which hangeth ouer our heads, or lieth vpon vs, or ſuch bleſſings as we ſtand in preſent neede of: theſe are to be prayed for till wee obtaine our deſire, as Iaakob would not let the Angell goe till he had bleſſed him: or till wee haue ſome better thing in liew thereof, as Paul
                         prayed againſt the temptation, till he had grace ſufficient giuen to him againſt it, or till there be no hope of obtaining our deſire; that is, till God doth euidently declare that it is his wil not to grant it,2. Sam. 12. 20, 23. as Dauid continued to pray for his childe while it liued, but when it was departed, he ceaſed to pray for him, ſaying, The childe being now dead, wherefore ſhould I now faſt, can I bring him againe any more?

                        Queſt. 2. VVAs not thus much implied vnder the fore-named circumſtance of time, alwayes, or in euery ſeaſon.
                     
                     
                        Anſw. Seeing the Apoſtle doth heere ſet downe the Doctrine of Prayer ſo diſtinctly and ſuccinctly, we may not imagine that hee would twice ſet downe in one and the ſame verſe, one and the ſame thing, and that in two differing phraſes. There is certainly a difference betwixt theſe two branches, which I take to be eſpecially in theſe two reſpects.
                     1 That is more generall, hauing reſpect to the whole courſe of a Chriſtians life, that he haue his ſet times: conſtantly obſerue them, and be euer ready on all occaſions to pray.
                     
                        This is more particular, hauing reſpect to ſome eſpeciall occaſions, that in crauing them we ſhould bee inſtant and vrgent.
                     2 That reſpecteth the dutie and worke of prayer, that we be conſtant in performing it.
                     
                        This the iſſue and euent of prayer, or the bleſſing which floweth from it: for it is the effect and iſſue of our prayer that maketh vs more or leſſe importunate: Longer or ſhorter to continue in prayer. If it be long before we receiue that which we deſire, the longer we perſeuere and continue in prayer.
                  
                  
                     §. 140. Of the difference betwixt perſeuering and much babling in prayer.
                     
                        Queſt. 3. VVHat difference is there betwixt theſe many, and long prayers implied vnder perſeuerance, andMatth. 6. 7. thoſe vaine repetitions, much babling and&amp; 23. 14. long prayers condemned by Chriſt in the Scribes and Phariſies.
                     
                        Anſw. Very much and great: euen as great as betwixt white and blacke, light and darkneſſe, ſincerity and hypocriſie.
                     1 Theſe many and long prayers heere intimated, are proportioned according to Gods particular dealing with vs: if it be long before he grant our requeſt, wee goe the oftner vnto him, and we hold out the longer in prayer.
                     
                        Thoſe vaine repetitions and babblings are ſtinted by ſet and certaine periods of time appointed before hand, without any reſpect of Gods dealing.
                     2 Theſe come from the vehemencie of deſire, and ardencie of affection.
                     
                        Thoſe onely from the tongue and lips.
                     The Papiſts are like to Phariſies in both theſe.The much babbling of Papiſts in prayer. For firſt they meaſure the number and continuance of their prayers by their ſet times: for which purpoſe they haue both ſet formes of prayer, and alſo chaines of Beades to put them in minde when their ſtint is ended; yea they ſet downe ſo great a number of repetitions, as cannot bee freed from vaine repetitions.
                     
                     This name Ieſu is aboue fiue hundred times ſet downe to be repeated at one time in their Ieſu Pſalter. Againe, their prayers being in Latine (as I haue ſhewed before) which tongue all that ſay their prayers vnderſtand not, they cannot come from the heart, but onely from the tongue.

                        Rom. 12. 12. Col. 4. 2. In the word heere vſed is this dutie oft vrged: but moſt elegantly and emphatically doth theIſa. 62. 1, 6, 7. Prophet ſet it foorth in his owne example, ſaying, For Sions ſake I will not hold my tongue, and for Ieruſalems ſake I will not reſt, vntill the righteouſneſſe thereof breake foorth as the light, &amp;c. Againe, hee ſaith of other Watchmen, All the day and all the night continually they ſhall not ceaſe. Further, by way of exhortation, he addeth, Yee that make mention of the Lord, keepe not ſilence, and giue him no rest till hee eſtabliſh, and till hee make Ieruſalem a praiſe in the earth. Chriſt doth alſo excellently ſet it forth by two parables,
Luke 11. 5. one of a Friend,
                        &amp; 18. 3. the other of a poore Widdow. The
Friend was ſo importunate, as he was impudent againe: for ſo much the notation of the
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Impudentiam, et iniquitatem, et crudelitatē, &amp; ſupinitatem frequens vincit oratio. Chryſoſt. in Heb. hom. 27. originall word implieth. The Widdow by her importunitie ſo troubled the Iudge, as he feared he ſhould be wearie with her oft comming. Marke how impudent beggers will bee, they will receiue no nay: nor many who petition to the King, Councell, Lord Chancellor, Iudges, and the like, and by their impudencie oft obtaine their ſuits. Impudency, taken in the beſt ſence, as Chriſt vſeth the word, is ſuch an holy, conſtant importunity, as will take no denial. This we may vſe to God, and if we vſe it, we ſhal aſſuredly preuaile: for note what Chriſt ſaith,Luke 11. 7. 
                        Shall not God auenge his owne elect which cry day and night vnto him, though he beare long with them? Particular examples of oft praying for one thing, and long holding out in prayer,§. 98. were laid downe in the point of extraordinary prayer.
                  
                  
                     §. 142. Of the reaſons of Perſeuerance.
                     THe ground of this Perſeuerance is Gods wiſe diſpoſing prouidence,
                           Reaſon. Why God oft ſeemeth not to heare our prayers. who oft ſetteth a long date to the accompliſhment of his promiſes, till which time come, he ſeemeth not to heare vs, and yet expecteth that wee ſhould ſolicite and ply him with our prayers, not becauſe he needeth ſoliciters, and remembrancers, but for iuſt and weightie reaſons,
                     1 The ſacrifice of prayer is a ſweete and delight ſome ſacrifice to God.Heb. 13. 15, 16. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the calues or fruits of our lippes, which are prayers and praiſes, ſaith,
with ſuch ſacrifices God is pleaſed.
                        Pſal. 141. 2. In this reſpect prayer is called Incenſe: God is delighted with the prayers of his Saints, as men with the ſauour of ſweete incenſe. Hee loueth to heare them oft praying, and long to continue, prouided that the prayer come from an honeſt heart and true deſire.
                     2 God thus trieth the faith and patience of his Saints,Deus idcirco non celeriter annuit, vt tu diutius inquiras. Chryſ. in Mat. hom. 24. whether they can and wil continue to depend vpon him. Who ceaſe to pray, ceaſe to waite: they withdraw themſelues from God, h 
                        Gods ſoule will haue no pleaſure in them. (Heb. 10 38.)
                     3 By Perſeuerance prayers waxe more earneſt and feruent. Chriſt often praying, prayed theLuke 22 44. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        more feruently. Prayer is like to fire, which if it finde fit matter, the longer it burnes, the hotter it burnes. But God loueth not key cold prayers: they are as irkeſome to him as lukewarme water to a mans ſtomack.Reu. 3. 16. God will ſpue them out.
                     
                         4 God thus moueth his children to ſearch their hearts, to ſee if they can finde any cauſe in them why God heareth them not. This was a meanes wherebyIoſ. 7. 6, &amp;c. 
                        Achans ſin came to be found out: yeaIudg. 20. 27 by Gods denying once and twice to heare the Iſraelites, they were brought to repentance.
                     5 God doth thus commend his bleſſings ſo much the more vnto vs. For good things much deſired, oft craued, long expected, are more welcome when they are obtained, and wee mooued to bee more thankefull for them. Things ſoone obtained are little regarded.
                  
                  
                     §. 143. Of the damage of not perſeuering, and aduantage of perſeuering.
                     VVHat a vaine conceit is it to think,Vſe 1: Reproofe. that it is in vaine long or oft to call vpon God, if at firſt hee heare not. Such was the conceit of him who ſaid,2. King. 6. 33 
                        Behold this euill commeth of the Lord: ſhould I attend on the Lord any longer? This conceit cannot be free from pride and arrogancie; yea it is a diſdainfull and preſumptuous conceit. Yet by nature wee are all too proane vnto it: for wee are ready to preſcribe a time vnto God, and to ſay, So long will I continue to depend vpon him, and pray vnto him; if by that time he heare not, he will neuer heare. This is the cauſe that oft we faile of the fruits of our prayers, and fall into many temptations, giuing our ſpirituall enemies great aduantage againſt vs.
                     For our parts,Vſe 2. Exhortation. let vs learne how to carry our ſelues when God ſeemeth to reiect our praiers, euenMat. 15. 22, &amp;c. as the woman of Canaan, when Chriſt at firſt would not ſeeme to heare, and after told her plainely he was not ſent to her, and the third time compared her vnto a whelpe, yet ſhee continued praying: and what was the iſſue? her faith was commended, her requeſt was granted. Neuer any that perſeuered loſt their labour.
                     As for them who haue lyen long vnder a croſſe,Vſe 3. Conſolation. let them not thinke their prayers are not regarded, or themſelues not reſpected, becauſe at firſt they were not heard: we heere ſee that God expecteth perſeuerance.

                        FRom his direction vnto prayer,Coherence. the Apoſtle proceedeth vnto an eſpeciall requeſt, that they whom hee had inſtructed, and incited to pray for others, would in particular pray for him: whence obſerue, that
                     
                        As Chriſtians ought to pray for others,

                        ſo to deſire the mutuall prayers of others for themſelues. Seldome did Saint Paul write to any, of whom he requeſted not their prayers, whether they were whole Churches, as in this and many other Epiſtles, or particular perſons; asPhil. verſ. 22 
                        Philemon. This hath been the ancient practiſe of Gods children:2. King. 19. 4

Iames exhort hereunto, when he ſaith,Iames 5. 14

                     THe motiues which were alledged to inforce the dutie of prayer in generall, might fitly bee heere againe applied, for prayer being a dutie whereby God is much honored, and a thing very powerfull with God, and profitable to thoſe for whom it is made, we ought to take all occaſions to ſtirre vp others thereunto. But there are many more particular reaſons to vrge this doctrine: for by deſiring the prayers of others,
                     1 Wee teſtifie our great deſire of Gods bleſſing,Reaſons. and therupon we think it not enough to pray for it our ſelues but alſo ſeeke the helpe of others prayers to obtaine it.1. Teſtifi

                           Vſe 1 THis iuſtifieth the commendable and vſuall practiſe of the Saints at this day,
 who when they depart one from another, or write one to another, or being in any diſtreſſe, are viſited one of another, deſire the prayers one of another. The thing is good and warrantable: yee that haue vſed it be not aſhamed of it, neither ceaſe to vſe it ſtill; onely as the thing is in it ſelfe good, ſo vſe it well: not complementally for cuſtome ſake, but from the heart, and that in regard of the forenamed reaſons.

                     §. 148. That none too good to ſeeke the helpe of anothers prayer.
                     BVt for the better clearing of this point, I will more diſtinctly declare, the perſons both who are to deſire this duetie, and alſo of whom it is to be deſired.
                     For the firſt,Who are to deſire others prayers. 
                        All of all ſorts, none excepted, muſt deſire the prayers of others, not onely the yonger, meaner, inferiour ſort, as children, ſchollers, auditors and the like: but euen the beſt and greateſt, and that of ſuch as are much inferiour vnto them. Note the§. 144. forenamed examples, which ſhew that Kings, Queenes, Prophets, Apoſtles, deſired this kindeneſſe: what perſons more eminent for place, or more excellent for grace? if it beſeemed them, whom may it not beſeeme?
                     On the one ſide,Reaſons. the greateſt and beſt, while heere they liue are ſubiect to many infirmities, many temptations: and though they may haue ſome excellent gifts aboue others, yet they want many other, which meaner then they haue: beſides, they are proane to decay in the graces which they haue. On the otherſide, the prayers of the leaſt and meaneſt Saint are of force with God:Iob 34. 19. 
                        God is no accepter of perſons: it is the heart, the honeſty, ſincerity and ardencie of it, which he moſt reſpecteth, and not the greatneſſe and dignity of the perſon who prayeth.Simile. In this regard therefore, as the foote may be helpful to the head, and as a little mouſe may bee helpefull to a Lion caught and entangled with cords, by gnawing a cord aſunder, ſo may the leaſt Chriſtian bee helpefull to the greateſt by praying for them.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         Let none therefore thinke themſelues ſo compleate and well furniſhed,
 as they need not the helpe of others prayers: or ſo great, that it ſhould not beſeeme them to ſeeke this helpe.1. Cor. 12. 18 &amp;c. God in wiſdome hath ſo ordered the body of Chriſt, that the members thereof ſhould neede one anothers prayers: and that, both to maintaine mutuall loue among them (for mutuall prayers doe euen knit the ſoules of the Saints together) and alſo to ſuppreſſe arrogancie, that one ſhould not ſcorne and diſdaine another. If any bee otherwiſe minded, it is to be feared that ambition hath blinded their mindes.
                     If the greater are to deſire the prayers of the meaner, much more the meaner of greater, as children of parents, people of the Miniſters, &amp;c.

                     FOr the ſecond,Of whom. prayer is to be deſired. the benefit and kindneſſe of prayer is to be deſired of ſuch as wee know may know our deſire. Theſe are onely the liuing, who conuerſe among vs vpon the face of the earth: to theſe, whether preſent or abſent, we may make knowne our deſire: if preſent, by words or outward ſignes: if abſent, by letter or meſſage

                     1 In vaine, becauſe we can neither make ſigne, ſpeake, write, nor ſend to them: nor can they without ſome ſuch meanes, know the deſire of our heart, it is Gods propertie to ſearch the heart.
                     2 Without warrant, becauſe the whole Scripture affordeth neither precept, promiſe nor good example tending to that purpoſe; had it beene needefull, queſtionleſſe Chriſt would haue compriſed it in his perfect forme of prayer.

Their great champion who vſeth go gather together what hath beene,Bellarm. de Sanct. Beat. lib. 1. ca. 19. or may be alleadged: for defence of their ſuperſtition, idolatry, and hereſie, quoteth onely theſe diſtinct places out of the old Teſtament:Gen. 48. 16 The firſt is where
Iacob ſaith to Ioſeph, The Angel which deliuered me from all euill, bleſſe the children, &amp;c.
                     
                     
                        Anſw. The Angell there meant, is&amp; 32. 24. the ſame with whom Iacob wreſtled, which was Chriſt Ieſus,Mal. 3. 1. 
                        The Angell of the Couenant.
                     
                     The ſecond is that ſpeech of Eliphaz,
                        d Iob 51. Expounded. to which of the Saints wilt thou turne.
                     
                        Anſw. 1 Queſtion may be made whether euery ſpeech of Eliphaz recorded in that Booke be of ſufficient authority to iuſtifie a point in controuerſie:Quamuis haee verba non videantur cōuincere, quia non ſunt ipſius ſcrip toris libri, ſed Eliphaz amici Job, tamen ideo couincūt, quia indicant tunc fuiſſe conſuctudinem, &amp;c. The Author who alleadgeth this argument, denieth not but doubt may be made hereof.
                     2 The place is meant of Saints liuing on earth: neither doth it imply any prayer to them, but ſpeaketh of a due conſideration of 
                           •
                        heir eſtate, whether any were like to Iob.
                     
                     3Exod. 32. 13. The third is the prayer of Moſes, Remember Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob.
                     
                     
                        Anſw. Moſes meaneth not any interceſſion, which Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob made vnto God for their poſterity; but the couenant which God made with them in the behalfe of their poſterity.
                     Further hee heapeth vp ſundry places both out of the olde, and out of the new Teſtament, wherein prayers
                        Legimus viuentes à viuentibus inuocatos: ergo licebit etiam nunc inuocare coſdam ſanetos cum Chriſto regnantes. of the Saints liuing are deſired; and inferreth, that if it be meete and lawfull to call vpon the Saints while they are vpon earth, it muſt needes be lawfull to call vpon the ſame Saints when they raigne with Chriſt.
                     
                        Anſw. 1. There is difference betwixt deſiring Saints to pray for vs, (which this Text, and other like places warrant) and calling vpon Saints (which no place of Scripture doth warrant,) whether they be dead, or liuing.
                     2 The argument from the liuing to the dead followeth not: becauſe we haue warrant for the one, not for the other; and becauſe we can make knowne our deſires to
them, not to theſe:
                     
                     Let vs goe along with God, and vſe ſuch meanes of obtaining the bleſſings he hath appointed, and then in faith may we depend vpon him, and expect his bleſſing.
                     Thus much for this generall point of requeſting the prayers of others.
                  
                  
                     §. 151. Of praying for Miniſters.
                     OF the perſons in generall for whom prayer is to be made, we haue ſpoken§. 45. &amp;c. before. Now we will more diſtinctly conſider the particular perſon mentioned in this place,Who are eſpecially to be prayed for. for whom prayers are moſt eſpecially to bee made: this is ſet downe vnder the Apoſtles perſon: For me, ſaith he. Saint Paul was by vertue of his calling, a Miniſter of the Goſpell, euen a publike Miniſter vnto the whole world, by reaſon of his Apoſtleſhip: yet more particularly in thoſe places where he planted Churches, and where his Miniſtery was powerfull and effectuall, he was a peculiar Miniſter, as1 Cor. 9. 2. himſelfe ſaith to the Corinthians, If I be not an Apoſtle to other, yet doubtleſſe I am to you: for ye are the ſeale of mine Apoſtleſhip in the Lord. Among other Churches, that at Epheſus, to whom he wrote this Epiſtle, was planted by him: he was the ſpirituall father of that people, and an eſpeciall Miniſter vnto them. As a Miniſter of the Goſpel (yea and as their Miniſter) he requeſteth this duty, to pray for him: and ſo much is cleere by that which he would haue them pray for in his behalfe, namely vtterance, and liberty to preach the Goſpell.
                     From this particular I may raiſe this generall doctrine.
                     
                        People are eſpecially to be mindfull of their Miniſters in their prayers to God.
                        Miniſters are eſpecially to be praied for. As Paul and other Miniſters haue deſired this of their people: ſo wee reade thatActs 12. 5. when Peter was in priſon, Earneſt prayer was made of the Church for him: and&amp; 15. 40. when Paul and Sylas went forth to preach, they were commended of the brethren to the grace of God; namely, by Prayer.Mat. 9. 38. This did Chriſt giue in charge, ſaying,
Pray the Lord of the harueſt that he would ſend forth labourers into his harueſt.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 152. Of motiues to pray for Miniſters.
                     VVAighty motiues there bee to preſſe this duty for Miniſters eſpecially.
                           Reaſons. 1 A Miniſters calling moſt excellent.
                     
                     1 Of all callings, the Miniſters is the moſt excellent, neceſſary, and profitable: for it reſpecteth the ſoule (Heb. 13. 17 
                        for which Miniſters watch) yea, the ſpirituall, heauenly, and eternall good of body and ſoule.
                     2 It is of all the moſt difficult:2 Moſt difficult. whereupon the Apoſtle with great emphaſis ſaith;2 Cor. 2. 16. 
                        Who is ſufficient for theſ
                              •
                            things? difficult it is in two reſpects.
                     1 Of the worke it ſelfe.
                     2 Of the perſons who are deputed to that worke.
                     The function of a Miniſter is to quicken ſuch as a
                           •
                         dead in ſinne: to raiſe vp and reſtore ſuch as are falle
                           •
                        
                         backe againe; to comfort thoſe that are troubled in conſcience; to ſtrengthen the weake; to encourage the faint hearted; to confound the obſtinate; to ſtand againſt all aduerſe power; together with many other like things, all which are aboue humane ſtraine, more then fleſh and blood can doe: yet the perſons to whoſe miniſtery theſe great workes are deputed, are fleſh and blood,Ezek. 2. 1. ſonnes of men;c Acts 14. 15. 
                        Men ſubiect to the like common paſsions that all other men are, in conſideration whereof, many being called to this function, haue ſought to decline it, asExod. 3 &amp; 4 
                        Moſes,
                        Ier. 1. 6 
                        Ieremiah,
                        Ion. 1. 3. 
                        Ionah, and others; and2 Kin. 2. 9 
                        Eliſha, when he was to ſucceede
Eliah, deſired that the ſpirit of Eliah might be doubled vpon him.
                     3 Of all ſorts of men,Miniſters are moſt oppoſed againſt. faithfull Miniſters are moſt oppoſed by Satan and his inſtruments:Mat. 4. 1, &amp;c. ſo ſoone as Chriſt was publikely ſet apart to performe his miniſteriall function, Satan ſet vpon him in the wilderneſſe; and euer after the Scribes, Phariſies, Saduces, Herodians, and other limmes of the Diuell, perſecuted him from time to time.
Zac. 3. 1 When Iehoſhua ſtood before the Angell of the Lord to receiue his commiſſion, Satan ſtood at his right hand to reſiſt him. When the Apoſtles were to be ſent forth to preach,Luke 22. 31▪
                         then Satan deſired to winnow them as wheat. The hyſtory of the Acts of the Apoſtles, ſheweth what ſtorms haue continually beene raiſed againſt the Apoſtles, while they were diligently occupied in their miniſteriall function: one trouble came vpon the necke of another, as waue vpon waue. Other hyſtories teſtifie as much of other Miniſters: our times are not without too euident demonſtrations of this point. As Chriſt while he liued a priuate life, ſo others liue quietly in compariſon of the following times, but when they beginne faithfully to exerciſe their miniſtery, then ariſe the ſtormes: for Satan well knoweth that if theZach. 13. 7. ſhepheard be ſmitten, the ſheepe will ſoone be ſcattered; therefore he vſeth1 Kin. 22. 31 the King of Arams policy: he bendeth all his forces againſt the Captaines of the Lords army.
                     4 Their failing in their duty is moſt dangerous. If they periſh,4 The fall of Miniſters moſt dangerous. many periſh with them. For they are like the Admirall ſhip which carrieth the lanthorne, whereby the whole fleete is guided: if in a ſtormy and darke night that ſinke,Simile. whither will the rest of the nauy? WhenGal. 2. 12, 13 
                        Peter ſtept out of the way, many Iewes, and Barnabas alſo went aſtray with them.2 Pet. 2. 1, 2. That very Apoſtle propheſying of falſe teachers that ſhould bring in damnable hereſie, ſaith, Many ſhall follow their damnable wayes. How did Arrius in his time ſeduce the greateſt part of Chriſtendome? Neuer were there any Miniſters corrupt in life, or doctrine, but many were drawne into perdition with them.
                     Are not now prayers,
                           Vſe. Exhortation to pray for Miniſters. hearty and earneſt prayers to be made for Miniſters eſpecially. Oh pray that the Lord would ſend forth faithfull Labourers: and pray for a bleſſing on them which are ſent forth. Doe this in publike, doe it in priuate; let vs your Miniſters neuer be forgotten. We well know the power of faithfull prayer, and the need we haue thereof. You know the benefit of faithfull preaching, and the neede you haue thereof. Wee to our poore power are mindfull of you.2 Cor. 6. 11, 13. 
                        Our mouth is opened vnto you; our heart is enlarged: Now for recompence in the ſame, be ye alſo enlarged. You reape the fruit and benefit of that bleſſing which God beſtoweth on our labours.
                     Hitherto of the perſon who is to be prayed for.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 153. Of the things which are to be prayed for in the behalfe of Miniſters.
                     IT remaineth to ſhew both what is to be prayed for in the behalfe of Miniſters, and why.
                     
                     That which is to be prayed for, is in one word Vtterance: which is amplified, firſt by the manner; ſecondly, by the end.
                     
                     The manner is declared in two branches. Firſt, Opening the mouth: Secondly, Liberty of ſpeech.
                     
                     
                        The end is to make knowne the myſtery of the Goſpell.
                     The reaſons why the Apoſtle would haue thoſe things prayed for in his behalfe, are two: One taken from his Office: he was an Ambaſſador for the Goſpell. The other from his preſent condition: he was in bonds. Hereupon he repeateth againe the thing to be prayed for, (in theſe words, That therein I may ſpeake boldly) and the manner (in theſe) as I ought to ſpeake.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 154. Of Miniſters inability in themſelues.
                     ALL the things which are here ſet downe, the Apoſtle deſireth to be giuen vnto him, becauſe hee well knew he had them not of himſelfe: Here then firſt note,
                     Miniſters haue no ability to performe their Miniſteriall function,3. Obſeru. Miniſters haue no ability of themſelues. except it be giuen them.2 Cor. 3. 5, 6 
                        For we are not ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke any thing as of our ſelues. Our ſufficiency is of God, who hath made vs able Miniſters. Note what Chriſt ſaith to his Apoſtles;
                        Iohn 15. 5 Without me ye can doe nothing. Great were the paines which Saint Paul tooke in the execution of his Miniſtery: Hee laboured more abundantly then all the reſt: whereby is manifeſted that hee had a great ability thereunto, yet he ſaith;
                        1 Cor. 15. 10 It is not I, but the grace of God which is with me. In this reſpect he ſaith more indefinitely of all Miniſters,
                        &amp; 3. 7, That neither he which planteth is any thing, nor he which watereth.
                     I ſhewed§. 152. before that the worke of the Miniſtery is a diuine worke,Reaſons. and that Miniſters are but men. Now what is man to that which is diuine?
                     Is not this a ſtrong motiue to incite all to pray for their Miniſters.Vſe 1: 
                        Without Gods aſsiſtance and bleſſing they are
nothing. Yet2 Cor. 10. 4. 
                        through God they are mighty.
                     
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 Let not ſuch as haue ſome ability hereunto be inſolent therein;
 no, though they haue gifts eminent aboue others:
i Cor. 4. 7. 
                        For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receiue? Now if thou didſt receiue it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not receiued it? Let ſuch as are inſolent, take heed that God take not away their ability from them. God hath ſo dealt with many.
                  
                  
                     §. 155. Of praying for ability in Miniſters.
                     ALL the particulars here ſet downe for which the Apoſtle would haue the Epheſians pray in his behalfe, may be drawne to theſe two heads: Ability and liberty to exerciſe his miniſtery. Hence ariſeth a double inſtruction: one for Miniſters, the other for People.
                     
                     That which Miniſters ought moſt of all to ſeeke for,4. Obſeru. is, that they may well performe the worke of their Miniſtery.
                     2 This alſo is it which people ought to beg of God for their Miniſters.5. Obſeru.
                     
                     Obſerue the ſeuerall places wherein the Apoſtles deſire people to pray for them, and ye ſhall find this to be the matter of their requeſts. When the Apoſtles were aſſembled to pray together, thus they prayed,Acts 4. 29. 
                        O Lord grant vnto thy ſeruants that with all boldneſſe they may ſpeake thy Word.
                     
                     For Miniſters,
                        Reaſons. their Miniſteriall function, is that particular worke which God hath appointed to them, their proper Talent whereof they are to giue a particular account vnto the great ſhepheard of the ſheepe:
                        Ioh. 21. 15, &amp;c. and the meanes whereby they may beſt manifeſt their loue to Chriſt.
                     For People, the Office of Miniſters was appointed to gather them together,Eph. 4. 12, 13. till they all meete in the vnity of faith, and knowledge of the Sonne of God, vnto a perfect man. In a word, Miniſters by well performing their miniſterial function, doe moſt good both to themſelues, and their people. Marke whatTim. 4. 16. Saint Paul ſaith to Timothy, In doing this, thou ſhalt both ſaue thy ſelfe, and them that heare thee.
                     
                     How contrary are the deſires of many Miniſters to
Pauls?
                        
                           Vſe 1
 If God ſhould appeare to them as he did to Salomon, and ſay;1 King. 3. 5. 
                        Aske what I ſhall giue thee, I am afraid that too few would deſire ability to doe their worke, but rather ſome great liuings; others, places of dignity: others, applauſe and praiſe of people, with the like. For theſe are the things which men hunt after.
                     But are people otherwiſe minded? doe they deſire that their Miniſters ſhould be able, faithfull, and painefull? Surely very few in compariſon of the multitude, who rather deſire ſuch as are quiet men, content with any thing, friendly, and familiar with them, not inquiſitiue into them, nor examining what knowledge, faith, repentance, and ſuch like graces they haue: not buſie in prying into their faults, but rather winking at them; ſuffering euery one to follow their owne delights, with the like, which are profitable neither to people, nor Miniſter For by ſuch remiſneſſe and negligence,Eze. 3. 18. 
                        People die in their iniquity, and their blood ſhall be required at the Miniſters hand.

 the edification of his Church, or ſaluation of their owne ſoules, here learne what to pray for in their Miniſters behalfe: and if they haue Miniſters endowed with ſuch gifts, bleſſe God for them. For what we are to pray for, we muſt alſo be thankfull for, when it is beſtowed; as2 Cor. 1. 11. the Apoſtle implieth, ſaying, Labour by prayer for vs, that for the gift beſtowed vpon vs for many, thankes may be giuen by may perſons for vs. Yea, let them moſt eſteeme, and account of ſuch Miniſters,
1 Theſ. 5. 13 
                        Hauing them in ſingular loue for their works ſake. Not like the common ſort, who beſt eſteeme good fellowes and boone companions (as they ſpeake;) ſuch were thoſe Iſraelites of whom the ProphetMic. 2. 11 thus ſpeaketh; If a man propheſie of wine, and ſtrong drinke, hee ſhall euen be the Prophet of this people.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 156. Of Vtterance, what is here meant thereby.
                     NOw come we more diſtinctly to handle the particular points here laid downe.
                     The firſt is, vtterance.
                     
                     The word tranſlated vtterance,
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . vſually ſignifieth ſpeech. It is taken either paſsiuely for that which is ſpoken and vttered, or actiuely for the very vttering of that which is couceiued. In the former reſpect ſpeech and vtterance is giuen, when God miniſtreth vnto his ſeruants matter to ſpeake: according to that which Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples,
Mat. 10. 19 
                        It ſhall be giuen you what you ſhall ſpeake. In the latter reſpect, it hath reference both to the ſpeakers inability, (and ſo implieth1 Cor. 1. 5 an ability and faculty well to vtter that which he is to ſpeake) and alſo to the oppoſition which by others is made againſt him (and ſo it ſignifieth leaue

                         an ability and faculty to vtter that which is to be ſpoken, yet ſo as the other two may not ſimply be excluded: for fit matter to be vttered, and a good faculty to vtter it may not be ſeuered; abundance of good matter without ability to vtter it, is without profit, it cannot edifie another. Ability to ſpeake well without good and ſound matter is meere vanity: it can but tickle the eare. Againe, if a Miniſter haue both theſe, and want liberty, his knowledge and gift of vtterance are but as candlesMat. 5. 15. put vnder buſhels.
                  
                  
                     §. 157. Of a Miniſters ability to vtter what hee conceiueth.
                     HEre then I collect, that,
                     It is needfull for a Miniſter as to haue matter worthy to be vttered,6. Obſeru. A faculty of ſpeaking is needfull for Miniſters. ſo alſo a faculty well to vtter it.1 Tim. 3. 2. He muſt be apt to teach. It ſhould ſeeme that Moſes felt the want of this, when he ſaid;
                        Exod. 4. 10. I am not eloquent, but ſlow of ſpeech, and of a ſlow tongue. And Ieremiah when he ſaid;
                        Ier. 1. 6. I cannot ſpeake.
Therefore the Lord gaue them vtterance.
                     
                     The matter which a Miniſter conceiueth is onely profitable to himſelfe,Reaſon. the vtterance of it is that which profiteth others: forRom. 10. 17. 
                        faith commeth by hearing.
                     
                     Little regard haue they to the good of Gods Church, who ſpend all their dayes in the Vniuerſity, or in ſome ſuch like place of learning, to gather more &amp; more knowledge and vnderſtanding of diuinity, but neuer exerciſe themſelues in vtterance: neuer pray, nor vſe any meane, to attaine thereto: no, though they be admitted Miniſters, inducted into liuings, and haue taken vpon them the cure of ſoules. Though they may know much, yet their people are not edified thereby.
                     But what may we ſay of ſuch as want both knowledge and ſpeech? ſuch as the Prophet complaineth of, ſaying;
                        Their watchmen are blind,
                        Iſa. 57. 10. 
                        they are dumbe dogs, they cannot barke; they lie and ſleepe, &amp;c. Theſe are the very bane of our Church, and the diſhonour thereof; they take vp the places of better then themſelues: they take the fleece of the flocke, but feede it not; they driue away many from our Churches, and offend more that tarry in it: good they doe to none, but much hurt, and heavy is that account which another day they are to make vnto the Lord of the Harueſt; it had beene better both for the Church, and alſo for themſelues that they had been made carters, then Miniſters of the Word.

The many Sermons of his and Orations, and apologies, which are recorded in the Acts, are euident demonſtrations of his elegant and powerfull vtterance, as alſo of his boldneſſe and freedome of ſpeech.

That was ſaid not ſimply, but partly by way of ſuppoſition, (as if he had ſaid, many may, and doe take me to be rude in ſpeech; well, grant it to be ſo, yet none can imagine that I am ſo in knowledge) and partly by way of compariſon, in regard of the fooliſh, vaine, thetoricall flouriſh, and ſhew of eloquence, which other

                        That he came not with excellency of ſpeech:
                        Verſe 4. 
                        and that his preaching was not with intioing words. But for good and true vtterance, none went beyond him. Wanted he vtterance whenActs 24. 25. hee made Felix and Druſilla tremble as hee reaſoned of righteouſneſſe and temperance, and of the iudgement to come? Or&amp; 26. 28 when he cauſed King Agrippa to breake out in the midſt of his ſpeech, and ſay; Almoſt thou perſwadeſt me to become a Chriſtian.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 159. Of praying for gifts beſtowed.
                     YEt hee deſired that vtterance ſhould be prayed for in his behalfe,Why Paul deſired vtterance. not without good reaſon: for well hee knew, that
                     1 That which he had was not ſo perfect, but it might be bettered.
                     2 God could take it away whenſoeuer it pleaſed him.
                     3 Hee could no longer vſe it, then God continued to enable him.
                     4 No bleſſing could bee expected by it, vnleſſe God made it powerfull.
                     From the practiſe of the Apoſtle, &amp; from theſe weighty reaſons thereof I gather,
                     
                        Such gifts as God hath once beſtowed,
                        
                           Obſer. 7. Gifts beſtowed ſtill to bee prayed for. 
                        are ſtill to be prayed for. Compare the eighth and ſeauenteenth verſes of the firſt Chapter of this Epiſtle together, and you ſhall finde how the Apoſtle ſaith, that God hath beene abundant toward them in all wiſdome, and yet prayeth God to giue them the Spirit of wiſdome. Compare the 3. and 9. verſes of Coloſ. 1. and ye may gather as much.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 Haue not thoſe that are beſt furniſhed neede to pray themſelues,
 and haue the helpe of others prayers? Suppoſe they ſhould be deſtitute of no needfull gift, yet we ſee prayer is needfull for the gifts we haue.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 They are too inſolent who hauing receiued ſome gifts,
 truſt to themſelues, and look not to God who gaue them. Thus many ventring to ſwim alone,Simile. are drowned. Many that haue good gifts, periſh themſelues, and are a cauſe that others periſh with them. For ſonne fall into groſſe hereſies, ſome into a vaine kind of affectation, ſome forget that which once they had; ſome grow very ſots and dolts. By theſe, and many other wayes doth God iuſtly puniſh the pride of Miniſters.

                     FRom the meaning of this phraſe I gather that,

                     This manifeſteth an holy zeale in Miniſters, and ſheweth that they are not aſhamed of their function, but deſirous of the good of the people.Reaſon. In this reſpect doth the Apoſtle vſe this phraſe, where he ſaith,2. Cor. 6. 11. 
                        O Corinthians, our mouth is open vnto you. Beſides, by this manner of deliuering the Word, is the eare more pierced, and the heart more affected.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         Heere then may ſuch parents iuſtly be cenſured,
 as hauing children whoſe ſpeech is ſo weake, as well it cannot be heard of many, or ſo ſtuttering, as well it cannot be vnderſtood, doe yet traine them vp to be Preachers. Vnder which cenſure come they alſo, who hauing ſuch ſpeech, doe notwithſtanding thruſt themſelues into the Miniſtry; and not ſo onely, but alſo affect and ſeeke to preach in ſpacious and populous places: it cannot be, but that many which come to heare, muſt needs be depriued of the benefit of their preaching. The voice is an eſpeciall thing to be reſpected, in ſuch as are ſet apart vnto the Miniſtry. If one that cannot bee heard, or vnderſtood, ſhould come vpon a ſtage, he would be hiſſed oft againe: why then ſhould ſuch come into a Pulpit? Is it not more requiſite that a Preachers voice ſhould bee heard, and vnderſtood, then a ſtage-players voice?
                     As for thoſe to whom God hath giuen abilitie to open their mouthes, who can ſpeake audibly and diſtinctly, ſo as all that are preſent might heare and vnderſtand them, yet through a miſconceiued ſhamefaſtneſſe, or (I know not what) feare of ſtraining their voices, and ſpending their tongues, ſpeake ſo ſoftly and whiſperingly as few can heare them (to ſay the leaſt) they ſhew little deſire of edifying Gods people, preferring their owne eaſe to others good: yea they make themſelues guiltie of the loſſe of that benefit, which they that cannot heare them might otherwiſe haue receiued. I will not deny but that men may, and many doe fall into another extreame of needleſſe clamorouſneſſe, and without cauſe ſpend themſelues by opening their mouthes wider, and lifting vp their voices higher, then either the number of people preſent, or the neceſſitie of the matter deliuered, requireth: for they will vtter in ſmall aſſemblies euery ſentence and word, yea euen the quotation of places with the higheſt ſtrain of their voice that they can. As in other things, ſo in this alſo, a good meane and moderation, guided with iudgement and diſcretion, is to be vſed.
                     Then eſpecially is the mouth to be opened, when matters of more then vſuall note and need are deliuered. Moſt of all when open, notorious, ſcandalous ſinnes wherein men liue and lie, and whereof they are loath to heare, are reproued.Iſa. 58. 1. 
                        Lift vp thy voice like a trumpet, and ſhew my people their tranſgreſsions, ſaith God. But the practiſe hereof I leaue to the diſcretion of each wiſe diſpenſer of Gods ſecrets, according as their ſeuerall abilities and occaſions ſhall require.
                  
                  
                     §. 162. Of a Miniſters boldneſſe in preaching.
                     THe ſecond branch concerning the manner of vtterance, is boldneſſe, oppoſed to an euill vnbeſeeming fearefulneſſe. This implieth an holy courage and libertie which a Miniſter taketh vnto himſelfe, hauing reſpect to his Maſter that ſent him, and the office deputed vnto him, and not to the perſons of men, with whoſe contradictions and oppoſitions he is not daunted.
                     The notation of the originall word implieth as much:
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                         and it ſheweth that the boldneſſe here meant, is a gift wherby a man dares freely open his whole mind, and vtter any thing.

                           Obſer. 9. Boldneſſe needfull for Miniſters. 
                        courage, and freedome of ſpeech is needfull for a Miniſter in the execution of his Miniſtery. Oft did God ſtir vp his Prophets hereunto, as when hee ſaid to Ieremiah,
                        Ier. 1. 17. 
                        Ariſe, ſpeake vnto them all that I command thee: be not afraid of their faces: and to Ezechiel,
                        Ezec. 2. 6. 
                        Thou ſonne of man feare them not, neither be afraid of their words, &amp;c.
                        Mat. 1. 22. Chriſt manifeſted great boldneſſe in his Miniſtery, for he taught as one hauing authority, ſo as his hearers were aſtoniſhed: this boldnes made him ſo freely rebukeMat. 5. &amp; 6. &amp; 23. the Scribes and Phariſies, and diſcouer both the errors of their doctrine, and the corruptions of their life: yea, and thunder out many woes againſt them. Such was the boldneſſe of his forerunner
Iohn the Baptiſt, asLuke 1. 17. he was ſaid to come in the ſpirit and power of Eliah.
                        Mat 11. 14. Great boldneſſe didAct. 4. 13. 
                        Peter and

                     Many people are impudent,Reaſon. ſtiffe-necked, fierce and violent, and will ſoone quaile a Miniſter if he be not of a bold ſpirit. This reaſonIer. 1. 17. God himſelfe rendreth to his Prophets, to make them the bolder.Ezec. 2. 6. We ſee by common experience, how euery one will trample on him that is timorous and faint-hearted? Soone will people perceiue whether their Miniſters bee timorous or no: if they bee, they will ſurely treade on them. But if Miniſters be bold, men of courage, and freely declare their meſſage, they will daunt the ſtouteſt hearts. For Gods word hath a powerfull worke in it, if it be deliuered with power and courage. The Prophets and Apoſtles diſmayed their proudeſt enemies.

                     1 By an equall and impartiall preaching of the Word, without reſpect of perſons: Chriſt ſpared none: not Rulers, Prieſts, Lawyers, nor any other ſort: but told all of them their dutie.
                     2 By a declaration of the whole truth of God,See more of this point, §. 182. as occaſion requireth, concealing no part thereof for any by reſpects of fauour, feare, reward, danger, or the like. Herein did the Apoſtle ſhew his boldneſſe, for hee ſaith to the Elders of Epheſus,
                        Act. 20. 27. 
                        I haue not ſhunned to declare vnto you all the councell of God.

With great emphaſis doth the Apoſtle ſet forth his boldneſſe in this reſpect, ſaying,
Gal. 1. 10. 
                        Do I now perſwade men or God? or do I ſeeke to pleaſe men? that is, I am farre from ſeeking to pleaſe men.
                     4 By reprouing ſinne, andTitus 2. 15. that with authority, ſo as tranſgreſſors may be brought to ſhame (if it be poſſible) and made to tremble.

                     5 By deſpiſing all ſhame, feare, reproach, and diſgrace, which by prophane and wicked perſons ſhal be brought vpon vs, for performing our calling as we ought: it is expreſly ſaid of Chriſt,Heb 12. 2. 
                        He deſpiſed the ſhame: and the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelfe,Rom. 1. 16. 
                        I am not aſhamed of the Goſpell of Chriſt, and2. Tim. 1. 8. exhorteth Timothy not to be aſhamnd of the teſtimonie of our Lord: God commandeth his ProphetsIer. 1. 17.

                     IN theſe, and ſuch reſpects is this gift (a moſt needfull gift) to be prayed for: and Miniſters muſt labour in theſe reſpects, to ſhew their holy boldneſſe. Let vs therefore rouſe vp our dull ſpirits, and caſt off the cloakes of feare and ſhame; that in truth wee may ſay, as the Apoſtle did of himſelfe and his fellow-labourers:2. Cor. 3. 12. 
                        Wee vſe great boldneſſe of ſpeech, prouided that it bee guided with wiſdome: wiſdome and courage muſt bee ioyned each to other.
                     
                        Wiſdome, that vnneceſſarily, without the limits of our calling, as buſie-bodies, we thruſt not our ſelues into ſuch dangers, as we can haue no comfort in bearing: in which reſpect ſaith Saint Peter,
                        1. Pet. 4. 15. 
                        Let none ſuffer as a buſie-body in other mens matters.
                     
                     
                        Courage, that we ſhrinke not from that dutie whereuuto God hath called vs, to auoid imminent danger: leſt by ſeeking to preuent mans rage, wee pull vpon our heads Gods wrath.Dan. 3. 17. God is able to deliuer vs from the rage of all men: but all the world cannot ſhelter vs from the wrath of God.

                     In generall, we may note that the end which the Apoſtle aymed at, in deſiring vtterance, was for the edification of others: for to make a thing knowne, is to inſtruct and edifie others. Heere obſerue,
                     
                        That which Miniſters ayme at infitting themſelues to the Miniſtery, must be the edification of the Church:

                        ſeeke to excell, but to the edifying of the Church: expreſly the Apoſtle chargeth, that all things be done to edifying.
                     
                     For this end Chriſt ordained Miniſters, euen for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.

                     All the vnderſtanding of the Goſpell,Reaſon. which God giueth to his Miniſters, is a talent giuen them to occupy and imploy: by making knowne what they know, they improue their talent, they approue themſelues to their Maſter, they profit their brethren.

                        it pleaſed God by preaching to ſaue thoſe that beleeue. But
Rom. 1. 16. 
                        the Goſpell is the power of God vnto ſaluation: if the Goſpel then bee not the obiect of preaching, preaching muſt needs faile of the maine and principall end.

                        Now the Goſpell is a ſecret: for
                        1 Cor. 2. 8. 9 none of the Princes of this world knew it: it containeth the things which eye hath not ſeene, nor eare heard, neither came into mans heart.
                     It is alſo a Diuine ſecret: for firſt it could not be knowne, but by diuine reuelation: the Apoſtle expreſly ſaith, that
Epheſ. 3. 3. 
                        God by reuelation ſhewed this myſterie vnto him, and that
Epheſ. 3. 5. 
                        it was opened vnto the ſonnes of men by the Spirit, and thus came it to beEpheſ. 3. 10. 
                        made knowne by the Church vnto principalities and powers in heauenly places: ſo as it was aboue the conceit, not of men onely, but alſo of Angels.
                     2 Being opened, it ſeemed incredible vnto all, whoſe hearts the Spirit of reuelation did not perſwade of the truth thereof: therefore the Apoſtle prayeth for the Epheſians
                        Eph. 1. 17. 18 that God would giue them the Spirit of reuelation in the knowledge of Chriſt, that the eyes of their vnderſtanding might belightned, &amp;c.
                     
                     In a word, of all other things it is the moſt abſtruſe: no humane inuention like it: none of the Liberall Artes and Sciences comparable to it in profunditie. The Law is not ſuch a myſterie as the Goſpell, for the Law was ingraued in mans heart: and man doth ſtill by nature retaine ſome glympſe and ſparkles thereof: forRom. 2. 14. 15. the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Gentiles doe by nature the things contained in the Law, and ſhew the worke of the Law written in their hearts. But the Goſpell was neuer written in mans nature: it was extraordinarily reuealed, and is aboue nature: wherefore1. Tim. 3. 16. the Apoſtle contenteth not himſelfe to call it a myſterie, but alſo termeth it a great myſterie: intimating thereby, that it is a myſtery both of great weight and moment (the knowledge of nothing elſe can be more excellent, neceſſarie and profitable) and alſo of other things moſt obſtruſe, admirable and incredible: ſo as it is

                     THe Goſpel being a myſterie,
                        
                           Vſe. 1. It requireth ſtudy and prayer. ſuch a myſterie as we haue heard, it is not lightly, and ſleightly to be paſſed ouer: it requireth our beſt ſtudy and meditation, and it is worth the beſt paines that we can take: men naturally are deſirous to haue knowledge of deepe and profound matters: this maketh ſome ſchollers to ſpend much time, and take great paines in reading the Schoole-men, becauſe they account them profound Authors, in regard of the many deepe queſtions which they diſcuſſe: others in ſtudying Aſtrologie, Aſtronomie, Geometrie, and other parts of Mathematiques, becauſe they are accounted deepe Sciences, aboue the common conceit and capacity of ordinary men: there is no myſtery in any Science which men heare of, but they are very inquiſitiue into it, and deſirous to know it. Loe heere is a myſterie of myſteries, wherein out happineſſe conſiſteth: ſo as the knowledge therof cannot but be moſt needfull and behoouefull. Vſe we therefore all the meanes that poſſibly we can to vnderſtand it, and to all other meanes adde faithfull and earneſt prayer to God, to giue vs the ſpirit of illumination, that ſo we may the better conceiue it. In ſtudying it, let vs not meaſure i

Faith therefore in this reſpect, muſt be placed aboue our reaſon, and wee muſt beleeue more then wee can conceiue: herein hath faith a preheminency aboue reaſon, that it is of an infinite capacitie: for whatſoeuer God reuealeth, faith beleeueth, though reaſon cannot fatham the depth of it.
                     If in the myſterie of the Goſpell we ſhould beleeue no more, then by our reaſon wee can diſcerne the reaſon of, we ſhould beleeue little or nothing. Let vs therefore haue recourſe to Gods word, where this myſterie is reuealed, and pray to God by his Spirit to reueale it vnto vs.

For the Goſpell being a myſtery, it is no maruell that many who haue ſearched into it by their owne wit, haue erred therein. Their errors haue not riſen from any vncertaintie and variableneſſe in the Goſpell, but from the ſhallowneſſe of their owne conceit.

This his office ſheweth that hee was after an eſpeciall manner deputed, and appointed by God to preach the Goſpell. This charge being laid vpon him, very needfull it was that he ſhould haue vtterance with open mouth boldly to make knowne the myſtery of the Goſpell: and becauſe it was ſo needfull hee craueth the helpe of their prayers to obtaine as much. From the force of this firſt reaſon I collect.
                     
                        That charge which God is pleaſed to commit to any ones charge, ought to make him carefull in ſeeking,

                     §. 174. Of Ambaſſadours of the Word.
                     AN Ambaſſadour is an eſpeciall meſſenger ſent after an honorable manner from ſome great perſonage: for meane men vſe not to ſend Ambaſſadours. If it bee demanded who hee was that ſent S. Paul on his Ambaſſage, himſelf maketh anſwere in another place ſaying,2 Cor. 5. 20 
                        We are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt. Chriſt the great Lord &amp; king of heauen &amp; earth was his Maſter, &amp; ſent him: in which reſpect he oft ſtileth himſelfe the1 Cor. 1. 1

                        Queſt. Was S. Paul the onely Ambaſſador of Chriſt.
                     
                        Anſw.
                        Other Ambaſſadors beſides Paul.
                         No verily: for expreſly he ſaith in the plurall number, we are Ambaſſadours, which phraſe he vſeth not as earthly Kings, or other in great place doe, for dignity ſake ſaying, wee Leo, or we Gregory command this or that: for when he ſpeaketh of himſelfe alone, and expreſſeth his owne proper name, hee vſeth the ſingular number, asGal. 5. 2 
                        I Paul ſay,
                        Eph. 3, 1 
                        I Paul the priſoner,

                        I Paul haue written, &amp;c.
                     
                     
                         But when he vſeth the plurall number he ſpeaketh of others alſo, whom he ranketh in one and the ſame order with himſelfe, and maketh equall to himſelfe.
                     
                        Queſt. Who were thoſe other? any beſides the Apoſtles?
                     
                        Anſw.
                        The Apoſtles were ſpeciall ambaſſadours The Apoſtles were eſpecially after a peculiar manner the Ambaſſadours of Chriſt: for they had their commiſſion immediately from Chriſt, by Chriſts owne voice and word were they ſent forth: and in this reſpect the title of Apoſtle (which in effect ſignifieth the ſame thing that Ambaſſadour doth,Other Miniſters ambaſſadours alſo. namely, Sent) was appropriated to them: yet may we not thinke that they were the onely Ambaſſadours of Chriſt, for then after their departure Chriſt ſhould haue had no Ambaſſadours on earth, none who in his name and ſteede ſhould offer reconciliation vnto the world, and preach the glad tidings of ſaluation: certainly Chriſt ſtill continued to loue his Church as well as euer he did, and is ſtill as carefull to prouide all things needefull for it as euer he was: he cannot caſt off the care of it. What therefore hee did immediately after his aſcention by Apoſtles, doubtleſſe hee continued to doe by other Miniſters:Ephe. 4. 11. for when hee aſcended vp on high, he gaue not onely Apoſtles, Prophets, and Euangeliſts, who were extraordinary Miniſters to continue but a while til his Goſpel were ſpread al abroad among the Gentiles, but alſo Paſtors and Teachers, who were by ſucceſſion one after an other to continue till his glorious comming vnto iudgement: and theſe alſo are his Ambaſſadours: ſo as this title appertaineth to all Miniſters of the Word, and all are compriſed vnder that ſpeech of the Apoſtle, wee are Ambaſſadours for Chriſt: which is further euident by this titleReu. 1. 20. 
                        Angell (which ſignifieth a meſſenger) giuen to ordinary Miniſters.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 175. Of the dignity of the Miniſtry.
                     THis metaphor and title, Ambaſſadour, being applied to the Miniſteriall function, ſetteth forth theſe three things.
                     1 The dignity of the Miniſtery.
                     2 The duties of Miniſters.
                     3 The mercy of God in ordaining them to their function.
                     The dignity of Miniſters function, is in a ſpirituall reſpect ſo great, as no calling in the world can bee comparable vnto it.
                           Obſer. 16. The dignity of the Miniſtry.
                     
                     The dignity of an Ambaſſadours place, is greater or leſſe, according to the excellency of his Maſter that ſendeth him. An Emperours Ambaſſadour is preferred before a Kings, a Kings before a Dukes, and ſo in others.
                     Now Miniſters being appointed of Chriſt, ſent by him, declaring his will, in his name and his ſteede, they which know the excellency of Chriſt may well know what is the excellency of a Miniſters calling. Many other titles in Scripture are attributed to Miniſters, to ſet forth the dignity of their function, as1 Pet. 5. 1.

Thus ſhould Chriſts Miniſters bee accounted of. I would not bee vnderſtood (ſo much to ſpeake of outward reſpect) for our maſter is heauenly, our calling ſpirituall, our meſſage ſpirituall and heauenly: accordingly muſt the reſpect bee which is giuen vnto vs: which is diligently to attend vnto our meſſage, willingly to follow our directions, to account our comming welcome, our feete bewtifull,Gal. 4. 14 in heart to eſteeme vs as Gods Angels,Mat. 10. 40 yea as Chriſt himſelfe. For this end men muſt looke not on our perſons (for ſo we are not better then others) but on our Miniſtery and meſſage (for therein we excell all others) The honour and good which in this reſpect is done vnto vs,Iohn 13. 20 Chriſt accounteth as done vnto himſelfe.

                        He that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth mee. In this reſpect God ſaith of the Iſraelites1 Sam. 8. 7 
                        they haue caſt mee away, becauſe they reiected his Prophets: and againe,Mal. 3. 8 
                        they haue ſpoiled mee, becauſe they depriued his Prieſtes of their Tithes. Can ſuch deſpiſers of Gods Miniſters thinke they ſhall eſcape iuſt vengeance? Kings will not paſſe by any diſgraces and wrongs done vnto their Ambaſſadors vnreuenged, if at leaſt they can take reuenge. But Chriſt is able to execute vengeance on all that ſhall deſpiſe him and his, and aſſuredly hee will ſo doe:Mat. 10. 15 for he hath threatned as much: his Miniſters are eſpecially in the rank of thoſe concerning whom he hath ſaidPſa. 105. 15 
                        Touch not mine Annointed, for he added, and doe my Prophets no harme. Remember the wofull deſolation of
Ieruſalem, and note the cauſe thereof,Mat. 23. 37 
                        She killed the Prophets, and ſtoned them which were ſent vnto her.
                     
                     This Land, and the greater ſort of people therein, haue in theſe daies highly prouoked the Lord by diſgracing and abuſing his Ambaſſadours:1. Cor. 4. 13 
                        For we are made as the filth of the world, the off-ſcouring of all things.

The generall is, to carrie themſelues worthy of the dignitie and excellency of their place: we ſee that Ambaſſadours of earthly kings are very circumſpect ouer their cariage, behauing themſelues grauely, ſoberly, honourably, ſhewing themſelues to be men of wiſdome, able to diſcharge ſo weighty a function, &amp; that in a double reſpect, namely in regard of their own credit, &amp; of their Maſters honor. So ought Miniſters of the word to behaue themſelues as becōmeth the Ambaſſadors of the great Lord of Heauen: all Chriſtians are commanded to walkeCol. 1. 10 
                        worthy of the Lord, who hath called them,Phil. 1. 27 
                        worthy of the Goſpel, wherby they are called,Ephe. 4. 1. 
                        worthy of the vocation whereunto they are called: if all Chriſtians, how much more Miniſters whoſe particular calling hath an eminency aboue all. To this purpoſe tendeth that exhortation of Saint Paul to Timothy,

Otherwiſe as they diſgrace themſelues, and make themſelues to bee thought vnworthy of their place, yea to bee deſpiſed, ſo alſo they diſhonour their Maſter, as Hophni and Phinias did; whereupon God ſaid,1 Sam. 2. 30.

                           Obſer. 18. 2 Faithfulnes.
                        Salomon implieth that an Ambaſſadour ought to bee faithfull, where he ſaith,Pro. 13. 17. 
                        a faithfull Ambaſſadour is health, that is, procured and preſerued ſafely to his maſter, himſelfe, and thoſe to whom he is ſent.Heb. 3. 1, 2. Thus was the greateſt Ambaſſadour that God euer did, or could ſend forth, the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our profeſſion Chriſt Ieſus, faithfull to him that appointed him: and this teſtimony God himſelfe gaue of his ſeruant Moſes,
                        Num. 12. 7. 
                        he is faithfull in all mine houſe: ſo haue all good Ambaſſadours beene: but not to inſiſt on particulars, note what Saint Paul ſaith of the duty of all Ambaſſadours whom he tearmed Stewards,
1 Cor. 4. 2. 
                        It is required in Stewards that euery one bee found faithfull.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 181. of holding cloſe to Gods meſſage.
                     THis faithfulneſſe conſiſteth in three eſpeciall points.Wherein a Miniſters faithfulneſſe conſiſteth.
                     
                     1 In deliuering nothing but what he hath receiued of his Maſter,1 Nothing to be deliuered but what is receiued. and is agreeable to his will: in this reſpect Chriſt ſaid of that which he deliuered,Ioh. 7. 16, 17. 
                        My doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent mee; and further proueth that
he ſpake not of himſelfe: So the Apoſtle,1 Cor. 11. 13. 
                        I haue receiued of the Lord that which I deliuered vnto you: The Prophets to manifeſt as much to thoſe vnto whom they ſpake, vſed to prefixe before their meſſages theſe and ſuch like prefaces;
Ier. 14. 1 
                        The word of the Lord,
                        Mal. 1. 1

                        Thus ſaith the Lord, &amp;c. And that it may appeare that this is a duty, God giueth this expreſſe charge to his Prophet,Ezek. 3. 17 
                        Heare the word at my mouth, and giue them warning from me: and Chriſt this vnto his Apoſtle,Mat. 28. 20 
                        Teach them to obſerue all things whatſoeuer I haue commanded you. The Scripture noteth it as a property of falſe Prophets,
Ier. 23. 16, 21 to ſpeake the viſion of their owne heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. I haue not ſpoken vnto them, ſaith the Lord, and yet they propheſied.

                        Speake vnto them all that I command thee: and Chriſt to his Apoſtles,Mat. 28. 20 
                        Teach them to obſerue all things whatſoeuer I haue commanded you: Nothing muſt be concealed for feare or fauour: Of this mind was
Michaiah, who being deſired to ſpeake good to the King, as the other Prophets had done, anſwered;1 Kin. 22. 14 
                        Whatſoeuer the Lord ſaith vnto me, that will I ſpeake,
                        Ier. 42. 4 and Ieremiah; Whatſoeuer thing the Lord ſhall anſwer you, I will declare vnto you: I will keepe nothing backe.

                        Gods Word to be deliuered as Gods Word. This direction in general is laide downe by Saint Peter, who ſaide,1 Pet. 4. 11 
                        If any man ſpeake, let him ſpeake as the Oracles of God.
                     
                     That Gods Word may thus be deliuered, there is required in the diſpencer thereof,
                     
                         1 Grauitie oppoſed to lightneſſe,1 With grauitie. and vaine affectation: A wiſe Ambaſſadour will not deliuer his meſſage like a ſtage-player;See §. 163. the reſpect of him from whom he is ſent, the preſence of them to whom he is ſent, will keepe him from lightneſſe, and childiſhneſſe. Can lightneſſe then beſeeme Gods Ambaſſadours? Gods word is in it ſelfe full of grauity, no lightneſſe, no vanity in it. Saint Paul expreſly requireth grauity in Titus, and not without good reaſon; for this will breede reuerence and due reſpect to their meſſage in the hearts of their hearers.
                     2 Authoritie oppoſed to fearefulneſſe,2 With authority. and ſhamefaſtneſſe. Gods word hath in it a diuine power, and an admirable maieſty; and therefore muſt accordingly be deliuered. This is it whereunto the Apoſtle exhorteth Titus, ſaying;Tit. 2. 15 
                        Speake with all authoritie: We haue an excellent patterne hereof in Chriſt Ieſus,Mar. 1. 22 who taught with ſuch authority, as made his hearers aſtoniſhed. That thus we may deliuer Gods Word, wee muſt in the name of our Maſter, and by that authority which he hath committed vnto vs, vrge and preſſe that which we deliuer: this will ſmite the conſciences of our hearers, and make them1 Theſ. 2. 13 
                        Receiue the Word, not as the word of men, but as the Word of God: and thus will it worke obedience in them that heare it.
                     3 Sinceritie,
                        3 With ſincerity. oppoſed to falſifying and adulterating the Word of God, which is to mixe it with our owne, or others conceits, or to faſhion it to mans humour, ſo as it may moſt pleaſe man. This was the fault which the Apoſtle diſcouered in falſe Teachers, and whereof he cleareth himſelfe, and his fellow Apoſtles, ſhewing withall that they were carefull to vſe all ſincerity: for thus hee ſaith;2 Cor 2. 17, Expounded. 
                        Wee are not as many which corrupt the Word of God: but as of ſincerity, but as of God, in the ſight of God ſpeake we in Chriſt. The word tranſlated
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Pſeudopoſtolos tangit humanum ſenſum diuinae praedicationi miſcentes: vnde Eſayas ait Caupones tui miſcent vino aquam. Hieron. 
                        Corrupt or deale deceitfullie with, is a metaphoricall word, taken from deceitfull Vintners, who for gaine mixe water with wine: whereby is ſhewed that Gods Word ought not to be deliuered ſo deceitfully, but purely, and ſincerely; this is that vncorruptneſſe &amp; ſincerity which the Apoſtle requireth (Tit. 2. 7.) For the word is in it ſelfe pure and ſincere without any mixture: whereupon Saint Peter termeth it,1 Pet. 2. 2 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        Sincere milke: if accordingly it be deliuered, it will nouriſh; if it be mixed, it may poyſon.

                           Vſe 
                         THus then wee ſee that this excellent and high calling is not committed to Miniſters for their owne ſakes onely,
 for their honour and renowne, to exalt them, to puffe them vp, and make them inſolent, but to prouoke them to doe their duty. Whereupon the Apoſtle ſaith,

They who neglect the duties of an Ambaſſadour, can receiue ſmall comfort in the dignity of their ambaſſage: and yet many there be who ſeeke to be Miniſters, onely as men ſeeke to be ciuill Officers, for profit and promotion ſake, as is too euident by their carriage in their Miniſtry: they neither care to frame their liues worthy of their place, neither are faithfull in performing the worke of their Miniſtry, whereby they cauſe this honourable calling to be vilely and baſely eſteemed.

                     BVt howſoeuer ſome abuſe this excellent calling,
                           Obſeru. 19. 3 Gods mercy in appointing Ambaſſadors. yet God hath manifeſted his great mercy to his Church, in appointing men to be his Ambaſſadours vpon earth: for this hath God done both to ſuccour our weakeneſſe,1 Mans weakeneſſe ſuccoured. and to ſupport our faith. In regard of our weakeneſſe, we are not able to endure the glorious preſence of Gods glorious Maieſty. The very Angels are not able to endure it: whereuponIſa. 6. 2 they are ſaide to haue wings to couer their faces when they appeare before God: how then ſhould mortall man endure it? Note the behauiour of the Iſraelites when they heard God deliuer his Law,Exod. 20. 18 
                        They fled, and ſtood afarre off: They ſaid;Deut. 5. 25 
                        If we heare the voice of God any more, we ſhall die. Hereupon they made this ſuit vnto
Moſes,
                        Verſe 27. 
                        Goe thou neere, and heare all that the Lord our God ſaith, and doe thou declare all that the Lord our God ſaith vnto thee, and we will heare it, and doe it. This motion God well liked, and accordingly appointed ſonnes of men to be his Ambaſſadours, and to declare his will vnto his people. Thus in regard of mans weakeneſſe, are men (like to all others,Acts 14. 15 
                        ſubiect to the ſame paſsions that other are) ordained Miniſters of Gods Word.
                  
                  
                     §. 186. How Faith is ſupported by the miniſtry of Man.
                     ANd that greater credence might be giuen to their meſſage,2 
                              •
                           ans faith ſupported. they are after a ſolemne and peculiar manner (ſet in Chriſts ſteed, in his name, euen2. Cor. 5. 20. as if he himſelfe did it) to preach peace, and to offer reconciliation: the Goſpell is the meſſage of Gods Ambaſſadours: for the Apoſtle hauing relation to the Goſpell, ſaith; Whereof (o
                           •
                        
                        
                        for which) I am an Ambaſſadour. So that in reſpect of this function and place appointed to Miniſters, Gods people may with as ſtrong confidence imbrace and receiue the glad tidings of ſaluation thus brought vnto them, as if God himſelfe with his owne voice did make offer of it. Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt a Miniſter and a priuate man. A priuate man may haue great knowledge of the myſtery of the Goſpell, and be able to open and declare the ſence and meaning of it: but a Miniſter by vertue of his office hath this prerogatiue and preheminence aboue others, that in Gods ſteede he declareth reconciliation: ſo that when a Miniſter preacheth and applieth the promiſes of the Goſpell, he doth not onely declare and make knowne Gods mercy and goodneſſe to poore ſinners, but alſo is an eſpeciall meanes to moue ſinners to beleeue thoſe promiſes, and to imbrace reconciliation with God. Is not this a ſtrong proppe vnto our faith? doth it not bring great comfort and peace to diſtreſſed ſoules?

                           Vſe. Reiect not the Goſpell becauſe it is preached by man▪
                         because they are ſonnes of men; yeeld not to Satans ſuggeſtions, whereby he laboureth to perſwade men that whatſoeuer Miniſters ſay of peace and reconciliation, God meaneth no ſuch thing: but rather, ſeeing God hath ſent them forth, and ſet them in his ſteede,Gal. 4. 14. Receiue them as Gods Angels, yea, as Chriſt Ieſus: and1 Theſ. 2. 13 receiue the Word preached by them, as it is indeed the Word of God, which alſo worketh in you that beleeue:

                        Beleeue Gods Prophets, ſo ſhall you proſper. Whoſoeuer lightly eſteeme their Miniſtry, and beleeue not their meſſage, they put from them the very Word of God, and iudge themſelues vnworthy of euerlaſting life.
                  
                  
                     §. 188. Of the manner of Pauls being chained.
                     THe ſecond reaſon, whereby the Apoſtle inforceth his requeſt for the helpe of their prayer, is taken from his preſent condition. He was in bonds, or word for word,

                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        In a chaine. This phraſe implieth that he had not free liberty, but was reſtrained: reſtrained, I ſay, ſo as he could not goe from Countrey to Countrey, and from Church to Church, as he had done before times; yet not ſo as thoſe which are cloſe held within the wals of a dungeon, or cloſe priſon: for then could he not haue performed his ambaſſage,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . as here he expreſly ſaith he did, (I doe my ambaſſage in a chaine) then would hee rather haue deſired the helpe of their prayers for his deliuerance out of priſon.
                     It is likely that he hath reference to that time (whereof
Act. 28. 16, 31. Saint Luke maketh mention) when hee dwelt by himſelfe with a ſouldier that kept him, and preached the Kingdome of GOD.
                     
                     
                        Obiect. But there is no mention made of manicling, fettering, or binding with chaines, which ſeemeth hereto be implied.
                     
                        Anſw. At Rome (where Paul was a priſoner) ſuch priſoners as were not cloſed vp in priſons,How Paul was chained. but had liberty to goe abroade,Lipſius in lib. Taciti 3. had a long chaine, the one end whereof was faſtened to their right hand, and the other end was tied to a ſouldiers left hand, ſo as the priſoner could goe no whether without that ſouldier, who was as a keeper to him. And thus it is likely that Saint Paul was chained: for he mentioneth here but one chaine in the ſingular number: and it is ſaid thatActs 28. 16. 
                        Paul was with a Souldier that kept him.
                     
                     
                         Here note theſe diſtinct points.
                     1 The Apoſtles condition; he was in a chaine.
                     2 The declaration of it. He himſelfe makes it knowne.
                     3 The cauſe of his condition, for the Goſpell.
                     4 The connexion of his office and condition together.
                     5 The reaſon why here he maketh mention of it.
                  
                  
                     §. 189. Of the hard vſage of Miniſters.
                     1 FOr the firſt: Notorious malefactors were wont to be chained: Here then note how
                     
                        An holy Apoſtle is vſed as a thiefe.
                        
                           Obſeru. 20. Chriſts Miniſters vſed as malefactors. In which reſpect hee ſaith,2 Tim. 2. 9 
                        I ſuffer trouble as an euill doer, euen vnto bonds. Thus was Peter dealt withall,Acts 12. 4. 6. 
                        He was put in priſon, and deliuered to foure quaternions of Souldiers, hee was bound with two chaines, and lay betweene two ſouldiers, and the Keepers before the doore kept the priſon. Yea thus was Chriſt himſelfe dealt withall: forMat. 26. 47. 55. 
                        a great multitude came as againſt a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to take him. The like might be exemplied in many other Prophets, Apoſtles, Miniſters, and faithfull ſeruants of Chriſt: for it hath beene the common condition of all, in times of perſecution eſpecially.
                     What might be the reaſon hereof?Reaſon. any notorious crimes which they commited, or any vniuſt offence that they gaue to their perſecutors? No verily. No Chriſtian can imagine any ſuch thing of Chriſt,1 Pet. 2. 22. 
                        Who did no ſinne, neither was guile found in his mouth. Saint Paul was ready to doe what good he could to all: forRom. 1. 14. he held himſelfe debter to all, namely, in loue: but hurt he did to none. The like may be ſaid of others, who haue beene ſo handled. They haue beene as ſheepe very profitable and harmeleſſe: for the Spirit which commeth from aboue was in them, which is,Iam. 3. 17. 
                        Firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be entreated, full of mercy, and good fruits, &amp;c. It is therefore an euill iealous ſuſpition which the World hath of them, together with an inward inueterate enuy and malice which it hath againſt them, which maketh it ſo handle them, and that becauſe they are not of the World. Reade Iohn 15. 19.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         Let vs not cenſure men according to the Worlds dealing with them.
 Let vs not iudge ſuch (as wee haue iuſt cauſe to account Chriſts faithfull ſeruants) malefactors, becauſe by perſecutors they are handled as malefactors: ſo might we condemn thoſe worthy Martyrs which ſuffered in Queene Maries dayes, and many that are moſt vilely vſed by the Spaniſh inquiſition, and other perſecuting Papiſts in other places.
                  
                  
                     §. 190. Of Pauls holy glorying in his Chaine.
                     2 FOr the ſecond, the Apoſtle himſelfe declareth and maketh knowne this condition wherein he was at
Rome, and that vnder his hand by a publike letter ſent to an whole Church, which was alſo to remaine vnto all Churches, to be read of all: ſo that it appeareth he was no whit aſhamed of his chaine.
                     
                        Perſecution ſimply in itſelfe is no matter of ſhame.
                        
                           Obſer. 21. Perſecution no matter of ſhame. Expreſly the Apoſtle ſaith,2 Tim. 1. 8. 12. that he was not aſhamed of his ſuffering: And he exhorteth Timothy not to be aſhamed of him, becauſe hee was Chriſts priſoner: If any ſuffer as a Chriſtian (ſaith Saint Peter) Let him not be aſhamed,
                        1 Pet. 4. 16. 
                        but glorifie God in this behalfe.
                     
                     Nothing ought to make vs aſhamed but onely ſinne,Reaſon. which maketh vs odious before God, becauſe it is a voluntary euill proceeding from our ſelues. Now to ſuffer, in it ſelfe is no ſuch matter.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         If for the ſinnes of this Land God ſhould (which God forbid) depriue vs of the light of his Goſpell,
 and of our Chriſtian Magiſtrates, and giue vs ouer to the power of ſuch aduerſaries, as ſhould chaine, impriſon, or any other way deale hardly and ignominiouſly with vs; let vs not thereupon thinke our ſelues, our brethren, or the Goſpell diſgraced, and thereupon be aſhamed of our profeſſion: The Apoſtle doth here rather boaſt and glory in it, as ſome doe in a chaine of gold: and the Scripture maketh perſecution a matter ofMat. 5. 12. gladneſſe, reioycing, andPhil. 1. 29. honour. If we ſhould be aſhamed, it would make vs ſtart backe from our profeſſion, it would diſcourage our brethren, and very much hearten our enemies.

                        Queſt. HOw can perſecution be a matter of honour and ioy? can any ſuch thing be in ſuffering? Why then ſhould malefactors be aſhamed?
                     
                        Anſw. As ſuffering in it ſelfe is no matter of ſhame, ſo neither of honour: it is the cauſe for which one ſuffereth, which altereth the caſe this way or that way.

                     3 The third thing therfore to be conſidered, is the cauſe of S. Pauls ſuffering, implied vnder this clauſe; For which, namely, for the Goſpell. For both the function, and alſo the condition of the Apoſtle hath reference thereunto, as hee was an Ambaſſador for the Goſpell, ſo for the Goſpell he was in a chaine.
                        
                           Obſeru. 22. The cauſe of perſecution is that which honoureth it.
                     
                     
                        It is the cauſe which maketh perſecution a matter of honour and reioycing. Note the Scriptures wherein perſecution is commended,Cauſa non paena facit martyrem. Aug. epiſt. 61. and ye ſhall find the cauſe either expreſſed, or neceſſarily implied: Note Mat. 5. 11. Phil. 1. 29. 1 Pet. 3. 14. &amp; 4. 16.
                     Perſecution in it ſelfe ſeparated from a good cauſe, is a puniſhment,Reaſon. and a curſe: a thing grieuous to the fleſh, and to be grieued for.

Acts 9. 2 Others for beleeuing the Goſpell. Now becauſe the Goſpell is the Doctrine of Chriſt, they which ſuffer for preaching or profeſſing it, are ſaid to ſuffer for Chriſts

Note how he maketh not onely open notorious ſinnes, but alſo medling with other bodies matters, to be an vnwarrantable and vniuſt ground of ſuffering. This therefore is to be obſerued, not onely againſt traytors, murtherers, theeues, adulterers, idolators, and ſuch like: but alſo againſt Separatiſts, Schiſmatikes, and all ſuch contentious ſpirits, as by raiſing troubles in the Church, bring trouble vpon their owne pates.

                     §. 193. Of the Worlds vile handling of Chriſts Ambaſſadours.
                     THe fourth point noted, is the connexion of the Apoſtles function and condition together, though hee were an Ambaſſadour, yet was he chained; and though he were chained, yet performed he his function: for he ſaith;
                           
                              •
                           
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                        I doe my Ambaſſage in a chaine.
                     
                     Hence ariſe two points to be noted. The firſt, that
                     
                        The Ambaſſadors of the King of Heauen are more hardly dealt withall then the Ambaſſadors of mortall Kings.
                        
                           Obſer. 23. Chriſts Ambaſſadours worſe dealt withall then others Ambaſſadours. We ſee by experience that all ſorts of Ambaſſadours are kindly vſed. The moſt ſauge and barbarous people that be, will not wrong an Ambaſſador. It is againſt the law of Nations to impriſon an Ambaſſador. Though Ambaſſadors be free in deliuering their meſſage, and though their meſſage be diſtaſtfull, yet at leaſt they are let goe free, if not rewarded. But Chriſts Ambaſſadors haue in all ages beene very hardly dealt withall. This was it whereofMat. 23. 37 Chriſt complained againſt Ieruſalem, ſaying; O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, which killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent vnto thee.
                        Acts 7. 52. And whereof Saint Stephen alſo complained, ſaying; Which of the Prophets haue not your Fathers perſecuted, &amp;c.
                     
                     
                        Obiect. They are not in all places, and at all times ſo dealt withall.
                     
                        Anſw. When and where it pleaſeth God to raiſe vp Chriſtian Magiſtrates who loue the Goſpell, and defend the Goſpell, then, and there the Ambaſſadors thereof are kept from publike perſecution: but yet the greater ſort of people will priuately ſcorne them, and wrong them. And though there be alwayes ſome, who knowing and beleeling the excellency, neceſſity, and benefit of their function, highly account of them, euen as of the Angels of God; yet thoſe ſome are but few in compariſon of the many which oppoſe againſt them. All that are of the world will doe what they can againſt them: And that in regard of their meſſage, and of their Maſter.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 194. Of the cauſes why Chriſts Ambaſſadors are hardly vſed.
                     1 THeir meſſage is as contrary to the diſpoſition of the world as can be:
                           Reaſon 1. Their meſſage irkſome. 
                        This
                        Ephe. 5. 8 is darkeneſſe,Mat. 5. 14 
                        That is light. Darkeneſſe cannot endure light: nothing can be ſo much againſt the haire (as we ſpeake) againſt the heart of a carnall man, as the Goſpell: it pierceth to the quicke, and ſo maketh him to fret &amp; fume, rage and raue againſt it, and the meſſenger thereof. For the world hath a peace of it owne, wherein it is faſt lulled aſleepe: when it is rowſed vp by any meſſengers of the Goſpell, like a Beare or a Lyon it beſtirreth it ſelfe againſt him that diſturbeth it, and forgetteth all modeſty and humanity. If it were a Father that brought this light of the Goſpell to a carnall ſon, the ſonne would hate and perſecute the father for it: ſo the father the ſonne, and one friend another: hence it is that Chriſt Ieſus the Author of this Goſpell, is ſaidMat. 10. 35. 
                        to ſet a man at variance againſt his father, and the daughter against her mother, &amp;c. which is not ſaid, to note out the proper end of Chriſts comming, but to ſhew what followeth vpon the ſending of the light of the Goſpell to carnall men, by reaſon of their wicked and obdurate hearts.
                     2 Their Maſter is indeed a great King,
                           Reaſon. 2. Their Maſter of another world.
                        Iohn 18. 36. 
                        but his kingdome is not of this world, if it were, his ſeruants would ſurely fight. Now becauſe he cauſeth none to riſe vp in armes to execute ſpeedy reuenge, but ſuffereth the wicked till the great day of reckoning, the world feareth him not, nor careth to abuſe his Ambaſſadors.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 How great is the blindneſſe,
 wilfulneſſe, wretchedneſſe, malitiouſneſſe, vngratefulneſſe of the world?
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 How are Miniſters to prepare themſelues againſt al the hard dealing that may be?
 let them not looke for ſuch reſpect at the worlds hands, as earthly Ambaſſadors find: if they find ſuch, they haue cauſe to ſuſpect themſelues. It is to be feared, that they ſeek too much to pleaſe the world. If they haue notActs 20. 24. the reſolution which this Apoſtle had, they may be as loath to deliuer their ambaſſage, asIon. 1. 2, 3. 
                        Ionah was.
                  
                  
                     §. 195. Of Miniſters vſing their libertie.
                     THe other point is, that
                     
                        Ministers muſt take and vſe what libertie they can haue.
                        
                           Obſer. 24. Miniſters muſt vſe what libertie they can. Saint Paul went as farre as his chaine would let him: In his chaine hee preached. So likewiſe in priſon heeActs 16. 32. preached. Thus did Chriſt and his Apoſtles, though they were perſecuted, continue to preach: when they could not in one place, they went to another.
                     There is1. Cor. 9. 16. a neceſſitie laid vpon the Ambaſſadors of God:Reaſon. and woe to them if they preach not the Goſpell, when they may. But if notwithſtanding ſome reſtraint, they doe what lawfully they may, and poſſibly they can, as they manifeſt thereby a great zeale of Gods glory, in preferring it before their owne eaſe, ſo great ſhall that reward be, which their Maſter will giue them.
                  
                  
                     §. 196. Of Miniſters forbearing to preach, being inhibited.
                     
                        Queſt. VVHat if Miniſters bee inhibited by Magiſtrates to preach: may they notwithſtanding that inhibition preach?
                     
                        Anſ. Difference muſt be made betwixt times of perſecution (when infidell or idolatrous,Whether Miniſters inhibited may preach. or any ſuch Magiſtrates as are open enemies to Chriſt beare rule, who ſeeke vtterly to ſuppreſſe the truth of the Goſpel, and roote out the profeſſors thereof) and times of peace (when Chriſtian Magiſtrates, who defend the Goſpel, &amp; ſeek the progreſſe thereof, gouerne the Church) The inhibition of infidels, and idolaters made ſimply againſt preaching of the Goſpell, becauſe they would haue it vtterly ſuppreſſed, is in this caſe no ſufficient inhibition to bind the conſcience: it is directly and apparantly contrary to Gods word. But when Chriſtian Magiſtrates inhibit Miniſters to preach, it is becauſe they thinke them vnfit and vnmeete, either for ſome notorious crimes, or for ſome erronious opinions, to exerciſe their miniſteriall functions. In theſe caſes, ſuch as are ſo inhibited, ſo far forth as they are inhibited, ought not to preach. Neither are particular and priuate men to iudge of the cauſe of the inhibition, whether it bee iuſt or vniuſt: but as they who are appointed by the preſent gouernment to ordaine Miniſters, are to iudge of their fitneſſe thereunto, ſo likewiſe of their vnfitneſſe.
                     Againe, difference muſt be made betwixt the kindes of Miniſters which are inhibited to preach. Some were ordained immediatly by Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; particularly commanded by him to preach: all the world could not ſilence ſuch: though they were inhibited, yet ought they not to be ſilēt, if at leaſt they were not forcibly reſtrained. Wherfore, we reade thatAct. 5. 40, 42. the Apoſtles notwithſtanding they were commanded by the Prieſts and Rulers of the Iewes to preach no more, yet cōtinued to preach:Amos 7. 12. &amp;c. the like may be ſaid of the Prophets, who were extraordinarily appointed by God. Other are ordained by the hands of men, euen of the Gouernors of the Church. Now as they haue power to ordaine Miniſters, when they iudge them fit for that place, ſo they haue power to depriue Miniſters, when they iudge them vnfit for that place, and therfore obedience muſt be yeelded to their inhibition.
                  
                  
                     §. 197. Of Miniſters needleſſe forbearing to preach.
                     BVt to returne to the point, Perſecution is no ſufficient cauſe to make a Miniſter ceaſe preaching; rather then not preach, he ought, as Paul did, preach in a chaine, if he may haue ſuch libertie as Paul had.
                     How will they anſwere it vnto their Maſter,Vſe 1▪
                         who vpon meere ſurmiſes and needleſſe feares abſtaine from preaching: not much vnlike to a ſloathfull man, that being to goe about his buſineſſe, ſaith,Prou. 22. 13. 
                        A Lion is without, I ſhall be ſlaine in the ſtreete? ſuch ought to be a Miniſters forwardneſſe in performing his ambaſſage, that he doe his vttermoſt endeauor, till he be directly and neceſſarily hindred.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 Heauie is that reckoning which they muſt make, who haue all the libertie,
 fauour and encouragement that they can deſire, and yet preach not.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 198. Of praying for Miniſters reſtrained.
                     5 FOr the laſt point, the reaſon why the Apoſtle heere mentioneth his chaine, is the rather to ſtirre them vp to helpe him with their prayers, that he might both be aſſiſted by God, in doing what he did, and alſo, if it pleaſed the Lord, haue greater libertie to doe more good. The word in the former verſe, and in this verſe alſo tranſlated
bould ſpeaking, ſignifieth alſo liberty to ſpeake.
                     
                     From the force of this reaſon, I obſerue,
                     The more Miniſters are reſtrained,
                           Obſer. 25. Miniſters reſtrained to be prayed for. the rather ought prayer to be made for them.
                     It ſhould ſeeme that the Apoſtle, when he wrote to the Hebrewes, was ſome way or other hindred, ſo as he could not then come to them, whereupon hauing deſired them to pray for him, againe hee deſireth themHeb. 13. 19. 
                        ſomewhat the more earnestly to doe ſo, that he might be reſtored to them more quickly: but moſt cleare is this by the practiſe of the Church, when Saint Peter was clapt vp cloſe into priſon,
Act. 12. 5. 
                        earneſt prayer was made of the Church vnto God for him.
                     
                     Prayer is the beſt meanes that can be vſed in this caſe:Reaſon 1. the moſt powerfull with God,Acts 12. 7. &amp;c. the leaſt offenſiue to men. Note the iſſue of the Churches prayer for Peter.
                     
                     There is alſo greateſt need of the beſt meanes in this caſe,Reaſon 2. and that in regard of the loſſe which the Church ſuſtaineth by the reſtraint of faithfull Miniſters.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         The vſe which we are to make of this point,
 is, that we put it in daily practiſe.
                  
                  
                     §. 199. Of the need of boldneſſe.
                     THe Apoſtle hauing vſed thoſe two forcible reaſons to mooue them to pray for him, returneth againe to the matter, and repeateth the thing which he would haue them pray for in his behalfe, namely, that hee may ſpeake boldly, which he amplifieth by the manner, as hee ought to ſpeake.
                     
                     The word which the Apoſtle vſeth in this latter place ſomewhat differeth from the former, that is a

                        Verbe: yet in effect they imply one and the ſame thing. This repetition of this point ſheweth, that
                     
                        Boldneſſe and freedome of ſpeech is very needfull for a Minſter:
                        
                           Obſer. 26. Boldneſſe needfull. The Holy Ghoſt repeateth not things in vaine: wherefore that which hath beene deliuered concerning this point, is the rather to be regarded. That which the Scripture againe and againe vrgeth, we muſt not lightly paſſe ouer, but giue the more diligent heede thereunto.

                     IN that vpon the mention of his chaine Saint Paul reneweth his deſire of this point, namely, that hee may ſpeake boldly, as if he had thus ſaid; Becauſe I am chained, I doe the rather deſire boldneſſe of ſpeech: I note foure commendable vertues in him.
                     1 An holy iealouſie which he had of his owne weakeneſſe.
                           Obſeru. 27. Foure commendable, vertues in the Apoſtle.
                     
                     2 An earneſt deſire of well performing his function.

                     4 A ſtrong affiance in the power of God.
                     1 For the firſt,1 His iealouſie of his own weakeneſſe. he was not ignorant that an iron chaine, a keeper continually by one, reſtraint of liberty, and feare of greater danger, were greeuous to the fleſh, (Heb. 12. 11 
                        For no chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be ioyous, but grieuous) that they might be meanes to dant the freeſt ſpirit, and to make the moſt couragious fearefull, that hee himſelfe was fleſh &amp; blood, that there needed more then fleſh, euen Gods Spirit to vphold a man, to make him bold to performe his duty in a chaine: wherefore though yet he were not danted, yet he deſireth Gods helpe in regard of his preſent affliction to ſupport his ſpirit, and keepe him from fainting.

                     2 For the ſecond,2 His earneſt deſire of well performing his function. ſuch was his deſire of courage and boldneſſe to performe his function as he ought, that being in a chaine, he deſireth rather ſtill in his chaine ſo to doe, then to be freed from his chain. For one would haue thought that being afflicted, he ſhould moſt of all haue deſired the remouall of the affliction: but hee preferred
that before this: as is more cleare &amp; euident by that which he ſaid to the Elders of Epheſus, when hee tooke his farewell of them;Acts 20. 24. 
                        I count not my life deare vnto my ſelfe, ſo that I may finiſh my courſe with ioy, and the miniſtry which I haue receiued of the Lord Ieſus, to teſtifie the Goſpell of the grace of God.

Doth hee not herein manifeſt a braue ſpirit, an vndanted mind, an inuincible courage?

                        Ephe. 4. 8. 
                        led captiuity captiue: ſo as they could no further reſtraine him then his Maſter permitted them; and he was not ignorant (for himſelfe ſaid it) that
2 Tim. 2. 9. 
                        though he himſelfe ſuffered vnto bonds, yet the Word of God was not bound: they chained his body, but they could not chaine Gods Word.
                  
                  
                     §. 204. Of the excellency of the foure forenamed Vertues.
                     BEhold here a rare example:Vſe: rare for the excellency, and rare for the ſcarcity of it. Admirable vertues were theſe, worthy our imitation.
                     1 They who maintaine in them ſuch an holy iealouſie, fearing leſt through the weakeneſſe of the fleſh they may be danted with affliction, will be the more watchfull ouer themſelues, more earneſt with the Lord in prayer to aſſiſt and vphold them, and more deſirous of the helpe of others prayers, as Saint Paul here was: ſuch haue beene found to ſtand out to the laſt caſt ſtedfaſtly, when proud crackers haue beene quailed.
                     2 To deſire while a man is vnder the croſſe, rather to preach boldly, then to haue the croſſe remoued, argueth a great zeale of Gods glory, and a true deſire of the progreſſe of the Goſpell, and edification of the Church: for thus he preferreth theſe before his owne eaſe, liberty, yea, and life too.
                     3 Conſtancy is that which ſetteth the crowne vpon a mans head. They who after they haue endured ſome trials, ſhrinke in their heads, and giue ouer the fight before their life be ended, looſe the glory of their former valour.
                     4 But to be perſwaded, that God is able to enable his ſeruants in all diſtreſſes and difficulties to doe that worke whereunto he ſendeth them, notwithſtanding their owne weakeneſſe, and their aduerſaries power, will make men not feare what can be done againſt them, but ſtill hold on vnto the end.
                  
                  
                     §. 205. How moſt mens diſpoſition is contrary to Pauls.
                     THus we ſee what rare and excellent vertues theſe be. But alaſſe they are too rare and ſcarce among men: as appeareth by their contrary diſpoſition: For
                     1 Many after they haue endured ſome ſmall trials, grow ſo inſolent thereupon, that they thinke they can neuer be moued, and ſo forget God, and care not to ſeeke helpe and aſſurance from him.
                     2 If they call vpon him, it is rather for deliuerance from that preſent croſſe, in regard of their owne eaſe, then for any ability to honour God, or doe good vnto his Church: when men are any way afflicted, they account deliuerance from it a great happineſſe, and therefore aboue all deſire it: Oh that I were at liberty, ſaith the priſoner: Oh that I were in my Country, ſaith the captiue: Oh that I had health, ſaith the ſicke man: and I wealth, ſaith the poore man.
                     3 So farre they are from reſiſting vnto blood, and induring till death, that ſo ſoone asMat. 13. 21. perſecution ariſeth for the Goſpel, they are preſently ſo offended and affrighted that they2 Tim. 4. 16. forſake their profeſſion.

                         of Gods almighty power and good prouidence, that they thinke it in vaine to call vpon God.

                     §. 206. Of the neceſsity of preaching boldly.
                     THe laſt clauſe is this, as I ought to ſpeake: which ſome take to be ſet downe by the Apoſtle as a further motiue to ſtirre them vp to pray for vtterance and boldnes of ſpeech in this behalfe, becauſe it was his bounden duty, neceſſity was laid vpon him, hee ought ſo to ſpeake: whence may bee obſerued that,
                     
                        It is not a matter arbitrary for a Miniſter to preach the Goſpell,
                        
                           Obſeru. 28. To preach the Goſpell boldly a neceſſary thing. 
                        and that boldly, but a neceſſary thing.
                        1 Cor 9. 16. 
                        Neceſsity is laid vpon mee (ſaith the Apoſtle) and woe vnto me if I preach not the Goſpell. As much may bee ſaid of all Miniſters: Their offices require as much, the charge is committed vnto them. They who doe it not, omit their bounden duty: wherefore euery ſleight occaſion ſhould not be an hinderance to them.
                  
                  
                     §. 207. Of preaching after a right manner.
                     BVt I take this clauſe rather to declare the manner of preaching, then a motiue to preach: and to haue reference both to his function, and alſo to his condition: that he may ſo ſpeake as becommeth an Ambaſſador, and ſo alſo as becommeth one which was in bonds. Hence firſt note that,
                     
                        It is not ſufficient for a Miniſter to preach,
                        
                           Obſeru. 29. The Word to be preached after a right manner. 
                        vnleſſe it bee done after a right manner: What is required vnto the manner of preaching I ſhewed before: the point in generall is againe vrged by this Apoſtle, Col. 4. 4. And by Saint
Peter ſaying,1 Pet. 4. 11. 
                        If any ſpeake let him ſpeak as the oracles of God. Thus in other functions doth the Apoſtle require aright manner of performing them. Rom. 12. 8.
                     The ſame Lord who requireth the duty it ſelfe,Reaſon. hath preſcribed the right manner of performing it, ſo as our obedience and faithfulneſſe is declared by the one, as wel as by the other.
                     In the duties which wee performe, let vs carefully obſerue how they ought to bee performed, if at leaſt in the performance of them wee deſire to be accepted. Little is this in regard by many: for to inſiſt in the point in hand, how looſely, how coldly, how trudely doe many preach the Word? as if it were inough onely to preach. Againe others fal into an other extreame: they preach the Word too curiouſly, too conceitedly, too vainely, with too great affectation and oſtentation. Little doth God regard ſuch paines: little comfort can Miniſters reape thereby.
                  
                  
                     §. 208. Of a Miniſters carrying of himſelfe according to his preſent eſtate.
                     AGaine,
                           Obſer. 29. Miniſters muſt carry themſelues according to their preſent condition. the Apoſtle implieth that,
                     
                        A Miniſter in bonds muſt haue reſpect to his preſent condition, accordingly to carry himſelfe: as he may not by his timorouſneſſe betray Gods truth: ſo neither by his indiſcreete and ouer-great boldneſſe indanger the ſame. This doth Chriſt imply vnder that generall precept,Mat. 10. 16. 
                        Be wiſe as ſerpents, and innocent as doues. Doue-like innocency will keepe vs from all fraudulent dealing, ſo as wee ſhall not deceiue our Maſter, and abuſe that truſt which hee putteth in vs. Serpent-like wiſdome will make vs preuent many miſcheefes, which otherwiſe through raſhnes we might fall into. Such wiſdome vſed the Counſell at
Ieruſalem, when they did forbeare to bee too violent againſt all the rites of Moſes Law, becauſe of the multitude of Iewes which beleeued, and permittedActs 15. 29. 
                        Abſtinence from blood, and from that which was ſtrangled: yea it may be probably collected that Saint Paul

                         which was at Epheſus, preached not particularly againſt
Diana, though in generall hee perſwaded the people that

                        They are no Gods which are made with hands, and alſo
verſ. 8. 
                        perſwaded the things which concerne the kingdome of God. For certainly there would haue beene many tumults raiſed againſt him, &amp; the Church (asverſ. 24, 25, &amp;c. through the malice of
Demetrius a ſiluer-ſmith there was afterwards) if by name he had inueighed againſt Diana.

               A TREATISE OF THE SINNE AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST.
               
                  
                     §. 1. Of the occaſion that Chriſt tooke, to declare the ſinne against the holy Ghost.
                     
                        THE Sinne againſt the holy Ghost, is moſt plainly and fully laid downe by Chriſt in his Recrimination, and iuſt cenſure of the Scribes and Phariſies, who malitiouſly ſlandred and blaſphemed the cleare euidence which he gaue of his Diuine power in diſpoſſeſſing a Diuell, that made the party whom he poſſeſſed both blinde and dumbe.
                        Matth. 12. 22.
                     
                     Their blaſphemous ſlander was, that Chriſt cast not out diuels but by Beelzebub, the prince of Diuels.
                        Verſ. 24.
                     
                     This ſlander doth Chriſt firſt remooue, by ſhewing that it was neither probable, nor poſsible, that by Satan ſhould Satan be caſt out.
                     Not probable either in the thing it ſelfe, or in their opinion who ſaid it.
                     Not in the thing it ſelfe,
                        Verſ. 26. becauſe then ſhould Satan bee diuided againſt himſelfe: which is no way likely, for ſo ſhould he procure his owne ruine: as is proued by an induction of three particulars, one of a Kingdome,
                        Verſ. 25. another of a Citie, the third of an Houſe, neither of which if it be diuided againſt it ſelfe can ſtand: ſo nor Satan.
                     
                         Now what probabilitie is there, that Satan an old, politique, experienced Prince, as deſirous as any other, to maintaine his owne Power and Dominion, ſhould wittingly ſeeke his owne ruine and ouerthrow.
                     Nor in their owne opinion was that which they ſaid of Chriſt probable;
                        Verſ. 27: becauſe they otherwiſe thought of other men that caſt out diuels. Their owne children (men bred and brought vp among themſelues) that caſt out diuels, as Chriſt did, were not by them thought to caſt out diuels by the power of Satan, but by the finger of God. Is it then likely, that in their conſciences they thought that which they vttered with their tongues, that Chriſt cast out Diuels by the Prince of Diuels?
                     
                     That it was not poſsible, that by Satan, Satan ſhould be caſt out,Verſ. 29. Chriſt proueth by that ſuperiour power which he caſteth one our, muſt haue ouer him that is caſt out: he muſt bee able firſt to binde him, and then to ſpoile his houſe. But Satan hath not a ſuperiour power ouer himſelfe: It is impoſſible that Satan ſhould be ſtronger then Satan.
                     Thus our Lord Chriſt hauing cleane quenched the fire of that blaſphemous ſlander (for a ſlander caſt on him that is innocent, is as a fire-brand put into water) and by his iuſt apologie ſtopped their blacke mouthes, ſo as they had not to oppoſe againſt that he ſaid, he ſetteth forth the high pitch of their impietie, which proceeded to plaine
blaſphemie againſt the holy Ghost: and from thence taketh occaſion to declare the vile nature, and fearefull iſſue of that ſinne.
                     Two Euangeliſts record the Summe of that which Chriſt deliuered, concerning the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, I will therefore ſet downe the text out of them both.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Matth. 12. 31, 32.
                        Wherefore I ſay vnto you, All maner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhalbe forgiuen vnto men: but the blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſhall not be forgiuen vnto men.
                        And whoſoeuer ſpeaketh a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall be forgiuen him: but whoſoeuer ſpeaketh againſt the holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiuē him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.
                        Mark. 3. 28, 29.
                        Verily I ſay vnto you, All ſinnes ſhall be forgiuen vnto the ſonnes of men, and blaſphemies, wherewith ſoeuer they ſhall blaſpheme.
                        But hee that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the Holy Ghoſt, hath neuer forgiueneſſe, but is in danger of eternall damnation.
                     
                     §. 2. Of the inference of Chriſts cenſure vpon their ſlander.
                     THE forenamed Recrimination, and cenſure which Chriſt gaue of the Scribes and Pariſies, is in theſe words; very ſharpe indeed it is, but moſt iuſt. The reaſon thereof is intimated by Saint Matthew, in the particle of inference ſet downe in the firſt place (Wherefore) and expreſſed by Saint Marke,
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . in the reaſon which hee layeth downe in the laſt place (becauſe they ſaid he had an vncleane ſpirit.) Very brazen-faced and impudent they were, that durſt openly vtter ſuch a vile ſlander againſt all probabilitie and poſsibilitie, yea againſt their own iudgement and opinion, and therefore Chriſt thought it not meete to ſpare them any whit at all. Whence learne, that
                     
                        As ſinners wax bold and impudent in ſinne,
                        
                           Doct. 1. The ſinnes of impudent ſinners are to be plainly diſcouered. 
                        ſo is the hainouſueſſe and fearefull iſſue of their ſinne to be diſcouered.
                        Iſa. 58. 1. 
                        Cry aloud (ſaith the Lord to his Prophet) ſpare not: ſhew my people their tranſgreſsion, and the houſe of Iaakob their ſinnes.
                        
                        Titus 1. 13. 
                        Rebuke them ſharpely, ſaith alſo Saint Paul to Titus. They who are acquainted with the hiſtories of the Prophets, of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles, cannot be ignorant of their holy zeale, in laying open the fearefull eſtate of notorious ſinners, euen to their very faces.
                     Thus,
                           Reaſons. 1 This may be a meanes to reclaime them. if they be not paſt all recouery, they may bee brought to ſome compunction and remorſe,Act. 2. 37. as the Iews were vpon Peters laying forth the hainouſneſſe of their ſin in crucifying the Lord Ieſus. This reaſon doth Saint
Paul alledge, where he aduiſeth Titus to reproue the Cretians ſharpely;Tit. 1. 13. for he addeth this clauſe, that they may bee ſound in the faith.
                     
                     If thoſe ſinners themſelues,2 Others may bee warned thereby to take heed of the like ſins. whoſe eſtate is ſo laide forth, be obſtinate, and will not thereby be any whit moued, nor brought to remorſe, but rather wax more impudent (as theſe Scribes and Phariſies, like the Iewes their fore-fathers,Ier. 44. 16. who ſaid to Ieremiah, As for the word which thou haſt ſpoken to vs in the name of the Lord, we will not harken vnto thee: and of whom the Lord ſaid to Ezechiel, The houſe of Iſrael will not hearken vnto thee,
                        Ezec. 3. 7. 
                        for they wil not harken vnto me: for all the houſe of Iſrael are impudent and hardhearted) yet may others be kept from going on in their courſe, and from growing to their degree of impudency, as is noted of ſome in Malachies time,Malac. 3. 16. who obſeruing the ſtoutneſſe of their fellowes againſt the Lord, feared the Lord.
                     
                     If none at all be wrought vpon by the knowledge of their ſinne,3 They are made more inexcuſable: and God more iuſtified then are they made the more inexcuſable: and Gods ſeuere proceeding againſt them is the more iuſtified. Thus much Daniel declareth in his confeſſion vnto God,Dan. 9. 5. where firſt he ſaith, We haue ſinned and committed iniquitie, and haue done wickedly, &amp;c. then he addeth, neither haue we hearkened vnto thy ſeruants the Prophets:
                        Verſ. 6. whereby he implieth that the Prophets declared their ſinnes, and denounced Gods iudgements againſt them: and thereupon he inferreth,Verſ. 7. 
                        O Lord, Righteouſneſſe belongeth vnto thee, but vnto vs confuſion of faces.
                     
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         Vpon theſe and other like proofes and reaſons Miniſters muſt learne,
 as they ſee iuſt occaſion, to put in practiſe the forenamed Doctrine, and by their holy zeale in laying forth ſinne, and the iſſue thereof, to ſhew their deſire of reclaiming ſinners, of ſtaying the infection and contagion of ſinne, and of iuſtifying Gods proceeding againſt ſinners.
                  
                  
                     §. 3. Of the reſolution and ſeuerall heads of the text.
                     TO paſſe from the Occaſion and Inference of Chriſts cenſure, note further the

                           Manner
                           Matter

                                 thereof.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     Chriſts manner of ſetting it forth, is with great ardency and authority, noted in the Preface prefixed before his cenſure (Verily Iſay vnto you.) The particle of aſſeueration
(Verily) declareth his ardencie: his auerring of it in his owne name (I ſay) ſheweth his authoritie.
                     
                     The matter of Chriſts cenſure is

                           1 Generally propounded.
                           2 Particularly applied.
                        
                     
                     In the general propoſition is noted

                           1 The Nature.
                           
                           2 The Iſſue.
                              
                                 of the ſinne cenſured.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     The Nature thereof is declared by the perſon againſt whom it is in ſpeciall directed, namely, againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                     
                     The Iſſue of it is, that it ſhall neuer be forgiuen.
                     
                     Both theſe are amplified by comparing them with the
Nature and Iſſue of other ſinnes.
                     Other ſinnes are committed againſt the Sonne of Man. This againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                     
                     
                         Other ſinnes ſhall be forgiuen.
                     
                     
                        This ſhall neuer be forgiuen.
                     In this compariſon is ſet forth a liuely repreſentation of Gods Mercy and Iuſtice.
                     
                     Of his Mercy in forgiuing euery ſinne committed againſt the Sonne of Man.
                     
                     Of his Iuſtice, in vouchſafing no pardon to the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 4. Of the truth and weight of the points heere deliuered.
                     THe firſt point to be noted is Chriſts Preface: whereby he ſheweth, that what he deliuereth concerning this point, is both a certaine and infallible truth: and alſo a point of weight and moment. Chriſt auerreth it vpon his authoritie and credit. I ſay (ſaith he) I that am a faithfull and true witneſſe, I who cannot lye, I who am the very truth, I ſay. So as, of what authoritie our Lord, the eternall Son of God is, this which he hath here deliuered is alſo, namely, true,Mar. 13. 31. certaine, infallible, vnchangeable, Heauen and earth ſhall paſſe away, but his word ſhall not paſſe away. With this authority doth ChriſtMat. 5. 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44. oft ratifie and confirme that expoſition which he gaue of the Morall Law: and oppoſeth it to the light credit of the ancient Doctors of the Iewes, ſaying, You haue heard it ſaid of old, &amp;c. But I ſay vnto you, &amp;c. ſo as his authoritie is more then any others can be, for Chriſt is the onely true Doctor of the Church: as he himſelfe teſtifieth of himſelfe,Math. 23. 8. ſaying, One is your Doctor, euen Chriſt. He hath power in his own name, by his own authoritie to deliuer any thing to his Church: which power is intimated vnder this imperial phraſe (I ſay.) And herein his manner of teaching is different from all others. For the vſuall phraſes of the Prophets were,Iſa. 56. 1. 
                        Thus ſaith the Lord:
                        Ier. 2. 1, 4. Mal. 1. 1. 
                        The word of the Lord: The burden of the word of the Lord: with the like. To make doubt of any thing which Chriſt ſaith, is to call his authority into queſtion. If therefore the word ſpoken by the Prophets was ſtedfaſt, how much more ſtedfaſt is the Word ſpoken by the Lord himſelfe, Chriſt Ieſus?
                     The particle ſet by Saint Marke before the clauſe of Chriſts authoritie, is in the Greeke Amen, and in the Hebrew ſignifieth Truth, and ſo not vnfitly tranſlated Verily. It is a note of an earneſt and vehement aſſeueration. Hereby then we are giuen to vnderſtand, that the truth heere deliuered is a weightie truth: not lightly to be regarded, and ſleightly paſſed ouer. For hee which gaue this commandement
(Let your communication be yea,
                        Mat. 5. 37. 
                        yea, nay, nay) would neuer haue added this vehement aſſeueration, if there had not been need thereof.
                     The reaſon why Chriſt firſt vſed this Preface, was to moue them who heard it, to giue the greater credence, and the more diligent heed to that which hee deliuered, leſt at any time they ſhould let it ſlip. And it is thus recorded by the Euangeliſts, that wee which reade it, or heare, ſhould know that the points heere deliuered are worthy our due and ſerious meditation: points needfull to be taught and learned.
                  
                  
                     §. 5. Of Gods mercy in forgiuing ſinne.
                     CHriſt hauing raiſed vp the attention of his hearers, by the forenamed Preface, in the next place he mollifieth the ſeuerity of Gods iuſtice againſt the blaſphemy of the Holy Ghoſt, by declaring the riches of his mercy, in reſpect of all other ſinnes, in theſe words, All ſinnes ſhall be forgiuen vnto the ſonnes of men, and blaſphemies wherewith ſoeuer they blaſpheme. And whoſoeuer ſpeaketh againſt the Sonne of Man, it ſhall be forgiuen him.
                     
                     
                         The mercie of God heere propounded, conſiſteth in the forgiueneſſe of ſinne: the greateſt euidence of mercy that could be giuen.
                     It is further amplified:
                     1 By the kinds of ſinne ſet downe both generally (all ſinnes, all manner of ſinne) and particularly (Blaſphemie).
                     2 By the perſons that commit ſinne (ſonnes of men) and among them (whoſoeuer).
                     3 By the perſon againſt whom the ſinne is committed
(the Sonne of Man)
                     
                     The firſt and generall point here to bee noted,
                           Doctr. Sinne may be forgiuen. Mat. 1. 21. is that
Sinne may bee forgiuen. A point well knowne to all that know the end of Chriſts comming, (which was, to ſaue ſinners) and the true ſcope and intent of the Goſpell,
                        1. Tim. 1. 15. which was to mitigate the rigor of the Law, that ſaith, Curſed is euery one that continueth not in all things which are written in the booke of the Law to doe them.
                        Gal. 3. 10. All the Sacrifices vnder the Law prefigured the truth of this Doctrine: and the many promiſes of the Word both in the old and new Teſtament, together with the manifold performances thereof to poore ſinners, doe abundantly confirme the ſame.
                     The true proper reaſons hereof are,
                           Reaſons. Ezek. 33. 11. the mercy of God (who deſireth not the death of ſinners) and the Sacrifice of Chriſt, whereby the Iuſtice of God is ſatisfied: in which reſpect Chriſt is ſaid to put away ſinne by the ſacrifice of himſelfe.
                        Heb. 9. 26. So as there is nothing in the ſinner to moue God to paſſe by his ſinnes, but onely the ſweete concurrence of mercy and iuſtice in God.
                     Admirable is the comfort which hence ariſeth to poore ſinners.
                           Vſe. Conſolatio to ſinners. Sinne makes the creature to be moſt wretched and curſed. By reaſon thereof hee is odious in the pure eyes of God: yea he is lyable to the infinit wrath of God, and to all the fearefull fruits thereof, which are all the iudgements and plagues which can be inflicted on bodie or ſoule in this world, and a curſed death at the departure out of this world, and eternall torment and torture in the world to come. Now then what comfort can be miniſtred to ſuch a creature ſo long as he lieth vnder ſinne? The very thought of the nature and iſſue of ſinne is like that
hand writing which appeared to Belſhazzer,
                        Dan. 5. 6. and changed his countenace, and troubled him, ſo as the ioynts of his loynes were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another. But what comfort and ioy will it bring to the conſcience of ſuch a ſinner, to heare the voice of Chriſt ſay vnto him (as to the poore palſie man which was brought before him) Son be of good comfort,
                        Matth. 9. 2. 
                        thy ſinnes are forgiue thee? Loe Chriſt hath here indefinitly, without reſpect vnto any particular perſon, ſaid, that Sinne ſhall be forgiuen.
                     
                     Let our care therefore be to ſeeke for pardon:
                           Vſe. 2. Inſtruction. Seeke for pardon. and not deſpaire, and ſinke downe vnder the burden of ſinne. The pardon is purchaſed and granted; let not vs reiect it, or neglect it.1. Iohn 1. 9. 
                        If we acknowledge our ſinnes, he is faithfull and iuſt to forgiue vs our ſinnes, and to clenſe vs from all vnrighteouſneſſe.
                     
                     Behold heere a ſure ground of repentance,
                           Vſe. 3. Admonition. Turne from ſinne. and a ſtrong motiue to ſtirre vs vp to forſake our ſinnes. If there were no hope of pardon, what incouragement could the ſinner haue to turne from his ſinnes? for his heart would thus reaſon, Indeed I am a weefull wretch through ſinne: but what will it now boote me to leaue my ſinne? my iudgement is paſt: there is no recalling of it: there remaines no pardon. But aſſurance of pardon makes him to alter the caſe, and thus to reaſon, Though I haue heretofore beene ſo wretched, as by ſinne to implunge my ſelfe into endleſſe miſerie, yet I heare that there is pardon for ſinners: ſurely I will no more continue in this wofull eſtate, I will ſeeke pardon for ſin paſt, and be watchfull againſt ſinne for the time to come. Were there no hope of pardon of ſinne, man would no more care to turne from ſinne, then the Diuell doth. This point therefore of the remiſſion of ſinne, muſt be vrged as a meanes and motiue to draw men from their ſinnes, and to worke in them true and ſound repentance. That repentance which ariſeth from faith in the pardon of ſin, and is performed in way of gratefulneſſe vnto God for his great mercie in pardoning our ſinnes, is the moſt kindly wrought, and will proue the trueſt, and beſt repentance.
                  
                  
                     §. 6. Of the extent of Gods mercy in pardoning all ſins.
                     SO farre reacheth the goodneſſe of God in forgiuing ſinne, as there is no ſinne (except that onely which is heere excepted, The ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt) but commeth within the Compaſſe thereof. All ſinnes (as Saint
Marke hath recorded Chriſts ſpeech) All manner of ſinne, (as S. Matthew hath recorded it) ſhall be forgiuen: not as if in the iſſue and euent, euery ſin ſhould indeed be pardoned (for then few men ſhould be condemned, which is contrary to the curret of the Scripture, that ſaith, Few ſhall be ſaued) but becauſe euery ſinne is pardonable.
                        Mat. 7. 14. The point then heere to be noted, is that (except before excepted)
No ſinne in the nature thereof is irremiſsible: originall corruption, and actuall tranſgreſſions: whether few or many: light or hainous: new bred, or old and inueterate: only once, or oft committed; on ignorance or againſt knowledge: voluntarily or by force: of infirmitie or preſumption: againſt God or man; without a mans bodie, or againſt his owne body: in ſecret or openly: by omitting or ſleightly performing that which is good: all may be pardoned. For a particular proofe hereof, take the example of Manaſſeh, who (I thinke) went the furtheſt in ſinne that euer any did ſince Adams time, and receiued pardon. Of his originall corruption no queſtion can be made: that his actuall tranſgreſſions were many, &amp; thoſe moſt hainous bloody, crying ſinnes, committed not on ignorance only,2. Chro. 33. 1, &amp;c. but againſt knowledge, voluntarily, preſumptuouſly, againſt God and man, the hiſtory recorded of him apparantly ſheweth:Verſ 13. and yet were they all pardoned.
                     The reaſon hereof may not be ſought in the party that ſinneth,Reaſon. or in the nature of ſinne (for euery ſin is mortall, and deſerueth eternall condemnation).Rom. 6. 23. In either of thoſe no reaſon at all can be found out: But onely in the extent of Gods mercy, and in the all-ſufficiencie of Chriſts ſacrifice. For the mercy of God is greater, not onely then any one, but then all ſinnes whatſoeuer: and the ſacrifice of Chriſt is a ſufficient price of redemption for all:1. Iohn 1. 7. 
                        His blood clenſeth from all ſinne. As Gods mercy and Chriſts ſacrifice are the cauſe of pardoning any one ſinne: ſo the riches of Gods mercy, and the infinite value of Chriſts Sacrifice, are the cauſe of pardoning all ſinnes.
                     
                        Obiect. Why then is not the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt pardonable?
                     
                        Anſw. Not becauſe it is greater then Gods mercy, or aboue the price of Chriſts oblation, but becauſe of Gods reuealed determination againſt it, as we ſhall§. 27. hereafter more diſtinctly heare.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 From this extent of Gods mercie we may well inferre,
 that mans deſtruction is of himſelfe:
                        Oſe. 13. 9. either becauſe he malitiouſly deſpiteth the Spirit of Grace, or wilfully reiecteth the offer of pardon. In the order of redemption God hath made mans ſinne pardonable, but man by his impenitencie makes it not to be pardoned.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 2 From the forenamed Doctrine we may take courage to
 flye to the Throne of grace for pardon, how many ſoeuer, or how great ſoeuer our ſinnes haue beene. Note the gracious inuitation of the Lord by his Prophet, ſaying,
Come now and let vs reaſon together:
                        Iſai. 1. 18. 
                        though your ſinnes be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow, though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll. Whenſoeuer the Diuell ſeeketh to bring vs to deſpaire, either by the multitude or by the hainouſneſſe of our ſinnes, let vs in faith plead this before God, All ſinnes ſhall be forgiuen: and thereupon apply to our ſoules the blood of Chriſt, which clenſeth from all ſinne: and be moued thereby to turne from all.
                  
                  
                     §. 7. Of Blaſphemie, how hainous a ſinne it is.
                     THe particular ſinne, whereby the forenamed mercie of God in forgiuing ſinne, is exemplied, is Blaſphemy. For in Saint Matthew, Blaſphemy is expreſly added to all manner of ſinne that ſhall be forgiuen: and in Saint Marke it is ſaid, that All blaſphemies wherewith ſoeuer men ſhal blaſpheme, ſhall be forgiuen. Whence are offered two Doctrines to our conſideration.
                     1 Blaſphemie is a moſt hainous ſinne.
                     2 Blaſphemie may be forgiuen.
                     The former Doctrine is implied by the particular mention of it in this place. For in that Chriſt giueth this as an inſtance and euidence of Gods rich mercy, in forgiuing al manner of ſinne, becauſe he forgiueth Blaſphemie, hee giueth vs thereby to vnderſtand, that Blaſphemie is one of the moſt notorious ſinnes, a ſinne which is moſt hardly forgiuen, which yet notwithſtanding being forgiuen, wee may well hope that other ſinnes may be forgiuen.
                     The truth of this Doctrine will yet more clearely appeare if we conſider the nature of Blaſphemie.
                     
                     
                        Blaſphemie (according to the notation of the GreekeWhat blaſphemie is.
                         word) fignifieth
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        to hurt ones fame, or credit: yea in Hebrew alſo a blaſphemer of God is ſaid
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            transfigere no men Jehouae. 
                        to ſtrike thorow the name of Iehouah.
                     
                     In former ancient times this world,Leu. 24. 16. 
                        Blaſphemie, hath bin vſed to ſet forth the diſhonor and diſgrace that is done to mans name and credit, in which ſence it is alſo ſometimes vſed in the new Teſtament: as where Saint Paul ſaith of himſelfe, and other Miniſters of the Goſpell, Being defamed,
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 1. Cor. 4. 13. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . (or (word for word to tranſlate it) being blaſphemed) we pray: and where Saint Iude ſaith of the wicked in his time, They ſpeake euill of (or they blaſpheme) dignities: Yet now long vſe in Gods Church hath appropriated the word Blaſphemie to an high diſhonour done to the great name of God: and that both in regard of the Matter, and alſo of the Manner, whereby Gods name is diſhonoured.
                     In regard of the matter of Blaſphemie, God is blaſphemed two wayes: either Priuatiuely, by taking away from God that which is due vnto him, and wherein his honor conſiſteth: or Poſitiuely, by attributing that vnto him, which is vnbeſeeming his Maieſtie, and diſhonorable to his great name.
                     The honor due to God is taken from him two wayes.
                     1 Simply, when that which properly belongeth vnto him is denied him. Thus becauſe the King of Aſhur denied that God was able to ſaue Ieruſalem, and to deliuer it out of his hands,2. Chro. 32. 17. hee is ſaid to blaſpheme the Lord God of Iſrael.
                     
                     2 By conſequence, when that which is proper to the Creator, is attributed to the creature: thus the Scribes and Phariſies imagining Chriſt to bee a meere creature,Mat. 9. 3. and not thinking that he was God, becauſe he tooke vpon him to forgiue ſinnes (which is a power proper onely vnto God) accuſed him of Blaſphemie: and againe, the Iewes went about to ſtone him for Blaſphemie, becauſe (as they alledge) he being a man,
                        Ioh. 10. 33. 
                        made himſelfe God. Though their cenſure of Chriſt were moſt falſe and ſlanderous, yet thereby they plainly ſhew what was accounted blaſphemie. But to make this point more cleare, the Holy Ghoſt expreſly ſaith of the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, that they committed great blaſphemies,
                        Neh. 9. 18. becauſe they ſaid of the molten Calfe which they ſet vp, This is thy God which brought thee vp out of the Land of Aegypt, whereby they attribute to the Calfe, a creature of their owne making, that which God the Creator of all things did.
                     The other kind of blaſphemie, in attributing ſuch things to God which are vnbeſeeming his Excellencie, is noted in thoſe Iſraelites that cauſed their ſonnes to paſſe thorow the fire, making God thereby like vnto the Diuell, to delight in mans blood: a thing moſt diſhonorable to the Diuine Maieſtie. The Lord hauing relation to that Heatheniſh and barbarous fact of the Iſraelites, ſaith to their children,Ezek. 20. 27. 
                        In this haue your Fathers blaſphemed me. Thus it is noted of thoſe on whom the Viall of Gods wrath was powred out,Reu. 16. 11. that they blaſphemed the God of heauen for their paines: their blaſpemie, without queſtion, was that they impeached God of iniuſtice, vnmercifulnes, cruelty and ſuch like things, much vnbeſeeming his glorious name.
                     In regard of the manner of blaſphemie, when any thing is ſpoken of God, or to God ignominiouſly, reproachfully, diſgracefully, contemptuouſly, or the like. Gods name is blaſphemed thereby:Exod. 5. 2. as when Pharaoh ſaid, Who is the Lord that I ſhould heare his voice, &amp;c. And when Iehoram, King of Iſrael ſaid,2. King. 6. 33. 
                        Behold this euil is of the Lord, what ſhould I waite for the Lord any longer? And when Nebuchadnezzar ſaid,Dan. 3. 15. 
                        Who is that God that ſhall deliuer you out of my hands? And when the wicked in Iobs time ſaid,Iob 21. 15. 
                        What is the Almightie, that we ſhould ſerue him? and what profit ſhould wee haue, if we pray vnto him?
                     
                     By the ſeuerall wayes wherein men blaſpheme God, wee may obſerue that this ſin of blaſphemie is directly derogatory to the honor of Gods name, which ought not to be taken in vaine, but rather had in all high account, and therefore a moſt hainous ſinne. Which doth further appeare by that feare which the Iewes had of naming it.
Blaſphemie ſeemed ſo horrible a thing to them, that when a man was to be openly accuſed thereof, they did not ſay in their publike accuſation, ſuch an one blaſphemed, but
ironically ſuch an one bleſſed God; vnder the name of that vertue compriſing the contrary vice. In imitation hereof,
Iezabel, when ſhee would haue Naboth put to death, thus frameth the inditement againſt him,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            1. King. 21. 10. 
                        Thou diddeſt bleſſe God: and accordingly the witneſſes gaue this euidence,
Naboth did bleſſe God.
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            Verſ. 13. Both ſhee and they meant that hee blaſphemed God: and ſo was their meaning taken: for thereupon they put Naboth to death.
                     The capitall puniſhment which by Gods Law was to bee inflicted on blaſphemers, doth alſo declare the hainouſneſſe of the ſin: (the words of the Law are expreſſe,
He that blaſphemeth the name of the Lord ſhalbe put to death).Leu. 24. 16. But much more that hainous cenſure which the Apoſtle denounceth againſt blaſphemers,1. Tim. 1. 20. ſaying, I haue deliuered them vnto Satan, that they might learne not to blaſpheme. To this purpoſe ſaith the Canon,Blaſphemus ſecundum legem eſt decapitandus, ſecundum canonem anathematizandus Can. paenit. 3
                              •
                           . 
                        A blaſphemer according to the Law is to be beheaded, according to the Canon to be accurſed.
                     
                     Laſtly, the practiſe of the Diuels and other damned in hell, which is, To blaſpheme the great God who caſt them in thither: directly contrary to the practiſe of the glorious Angels and bleſſed Saints in heauen, which is continually to ſing Hallelu-iaeh, praiſe and glory to God, ſheweth that blaſphemers remaining blaſphemers without repentance, are farre from hauing a part in the heauenly ſociety of Saints and Angels, and can expect nothing but to haue a part in
the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone.
                     
                     Thus by the very nature of blaſphemie, as alſo by the temporall, ſpirituall, and eternall puniſhment of it (all expreſly noted in the Scripture) we ſee that it is a moſt haynous ſinne: ſo as Chriſt might well bring this as a pregnant proofe of the riches of Gods mercy in pardoning al manner of ſinne. For if blaſphemie be pardoned, what ſinne may not be pardoned?
                     By the hainouſneſſe of this ſin,
                           Vſe 1. Reproofe of Papiſts blaſphemies. learne to iudge of that ſuppoſed Vicar of Chriſt, or rather plaine Antichriſt, the Pope of Rome, and his paraſites. If euer the name of
Blaſphemie might be written on the fore-head of any, it may bee written on the fore-head of that Seuen-headed ſcarlet-coloured Beaſt, which hath opened her black-mouth to blaſpheme the God of heauen, and the Sauiour of the world, more then euer any Pagan. What a blaſphemous ſpeech was that of Iulius the third, to ſay, If God were angrie with ADAM for eating an apple, might not he be angrie with his Cooke for eating his Peacock? And at another time, when his Phyſitian kept away from him a diſh which he liked well, but was hurtfull to his health, he ſaid, Bring me my diſh in deſpite of God. The blaſphemie of Leo the tenth was more odious, becauſe it ſeemeth to be more ſerious, for when Bembo his Cardinall was ſpeaking of the glad tidings of the Goſpell, he anſwered, What profit doth that fable of Chriſt bring vs? O intollerable blaſphemie! But not to inſiſt on particular ſpeeches of particular men, many of the Decrees made of their Popes are very blaſphemous, whereof take for a taſte theſe particulars.
                     The Pope of Rome is a God.In Decretal. Let no man dare ſay to the Pope What doſt thou. The Pope may diſpenſe againſt an Apoſtle. The Pope may change the nature of things. The Pope may make ſomething of nothing. The Pope may diſpenſe aboue Law. The Pope of iniuſtice may make inſtice.
                     Yea, many of their publike Prayers are alſo in the higheſt kinde blaſphemous againſt Chriſt, as where they pray to Chriſt to bring them to his Father through the interceſſion and merits of Peter, Paul, Thomas, Nicholas, Gregorie, and other whom they account Saints: and where they pray to the Virgin Mary to vſe her motherly authoritie ouer her Sonne, and to command him to doe this, and that.
                     The power of Abſolution which they giue not onely to the Pope, but alſo to euery Prieſt, is blaſphemous: for
§. 14. De Abſol. cap. 6. can. 9. by the Councell of Trent it is decreed, not to be a miniſteriall declaration, but a iudiciall act of forgiuing. The conceit of offering vp Chriſts glorified body by the hands of a Prieſt, is alſo blaſphemous: and ſo is the new Ieſuiticall inuention of mixing the milke of the Virgin Mary with the blood of Chriſt. Theſe and ſuch like blaſphemies cannot proceed but from the Impes of Antichriſt.
                     Blaſphemie being ſo hainous a ſinne,
                           Vſe 2. Exhortation to Magiſtrates to puniſh blaſphemers. Magiſtrates, who are gods on earth, ought to vſe all the meanes they can to ſuppreſſe it: and therefore they ought both to make ſeuere laws againſt it, &amp; alſo ſtrictly to look to the due execution of thoſe lawes: otherwiſe the vniuſt Iudges in Ahabs time,1. King. 21. 13. who condemned innocent Naboth to death, for a meere pretence, and vniuſt accuſation of blaſphemie; and the Iewes who ſuppoſing that Chriſt blaſphemed,Iohn 10. 33. were ready to ſtone him, ſhal riſe vp in iudgement againſt them: much more ſhall that Heathen King condemne thē who made a decree,Dan. 3. 29. that whoſoeuer ſhould ſpeak any blaſphemy againſt God, ſhould be drawne in peeces, &amp;c. Yea their practiſe in cenſuring and puniſhing thoſe who ſpeake euill of Dignities, and that ſeuerely (wherein they doe that which is iuſt and equall) ſhall condemne their remiſneſſe in ſuffering blaſphemies againſt the great and glorious name of God to goe vnpuniſhed.
                     And let euery particular Chriſtian take heed,
                           Vſe. 3. Admonition to take heed of blaſphemy. that the Diuell neuer preuaile ſo far ouer him, as to vſe his tongue as an inſtrument to blaſpheme God. For auoiding wherof, let vs retaine a reuerend and high account of the great name of God in our hearts: and be afraid to conceiue an euill thought, which may tend to the diſhonor thereof: much more fearefull let vs be of taking his name in our mouthes vainely, and of raſh ſwearing by his name. Common ſwearing by the name of God, wil ſoone bring vs to plaine blaſphemie.
                     Yea,
                           Vſe 4. Direction to giue no occaſion to others to blaſpheme. ſeeing blaſphemie is ſuch an high pitch of iniquity, let vs giue no occaſion vnto others to blaſpheme Gods name. They who call vpon the true God, and yet depart not from iniquitie, who profeſſe the truth of the Goſpel, and yet turne the grace of God into wantonneſſe, who make ſhew of Religion, and yet deny the power thereof, who ſeuerely iudge others, and yet themſelues do the ſame things, cauſe the name of God to be blaſphemed among the enemies of pietie and ſinceritie. Reade for this purpoſe, Rom. 2. 17, 18. &amp;c. whoſoeuer giue occaſion to the enemies of the Goſpell to blaſpheme God, the Author of the Goſpell, for their vnworthy walking therin, make themſelues acceſſary to this great and grieuous ſinne of blaſphemie: and accordingly ſhall bee iudged with the iudgement of blaſphemers.
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 8. Of Gods mercy in forgiuing blaſphemy.
                     THough blaſphemy bee ſo heinous a ſinne as hath beene declared, yet Chriſt here expreſly ſaith, that
Blaſphemy ſhall be forgiuen; ſo as from hence we may gather, that
                     Blaſphemers are not vtterly excluded from all hope of pardon.
                           Doctr. A blaſphemer may be pardoned.
                        Inſtance Saint Paul, who thus ſaith of himſelfe; I was a blaſphemer, but I obtained mercy.
                     Thus the Lord ſheweth that the ſaluation of man is as deare and tender vnto him as his owne name:1 Tim. 1. 13. Reaſon.
                         the piercing and ſtriking thorow of his own name doth not prouoke him to caſt the blaſphemer into hel, but his pitty rather moueth him to offer pardon, that ſo the blaſphemer beholding Gods goodneſſe ſtriuing with his wretchedneſſe, may be aſhamed of the fouleneſſe of ſinne, and brought to repentance for it.
                     Haue we not iuſt cauſe in this reſpect to wonder,
                           Vſe 1 Admiration of Gods mercie. and ſay; O the depth of the riches of the mercy of God!
                     
                     Hearken to this ô ye blaſphemers of the name of God,
                           Vſe 2. Exhortation for blaſphemers to repent. though the great flying Booke of Gods curſe be gone forth againſt you, yet may it be called in againe. Note for this purpoſe what Saint Paul ſaith of Gods mercy to him, who had beene in former times a blaſphemer:Zac. 5. 2, 3. 1 Tim. 1. 16. 
                        For this cauſe I obtained mercy, that in me firſt Ieſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long ſuffering for a patterne to them, which ſhould hereafter beleeue in him to life euerlaſting. Ceaſe therefore to blaſpheme any more. Lay hold of this Goſpell, this glad tidings of reconciliation, and be moued thereby to ſeeke how you may beſt honour his name, whom in former times you haue blaſphemed.
                     And let all of vs herein ſhew our ſelues children of our Heauenly Father,
                           Vſe 3. Imitation to bleſſe them that curſe vs. in bearing with ſuch as haue ſought our diſgrace. This is an hard leſſon to learne: for man accounts his name more deare the his life, and had rather his head or heart ſhould be ſtricken thorow, then his name and honour. Hence is it that the leaſt reproach and diſgrace cauſeth the greateſt reuenge that can be thought of. But this humour ariſeth from corrupt nature. Chriſt commandeth to bleſſe them that curſe vs:
                        Mat. 5. 44. which precept the Apoſtles put in practiſe; for of himſelfe, and of others ſaith Saint Paul,
                        1 Cor. 4. 13. 
                        Being defamed, we intreat.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 9. Of the principall Obiect of Gods mercy, Man.
                     AS the riches of Gods mercy is in generall commended by forgiuing all manner of ſinne, euen blaſphemie; ſo in particular it is commended vnto Man, by making him the peculiar obiect of this mercy of God: for to man doth Chriſt in ſpeciall appropriate it, ſaying; All manner of ſinne ſhall be forgiuen vnto MEN, (as Saint Matthew records it) To the SONS OF MEN (as Saint Marke ſets it downe.) From whence we may gather, that
                     MAN is the moſt principall obiect of Gods mercy. This inſtance of forgiuing ſinne, goeth beyond all other that can be giuen to commend the mercy of God; eſpecially if we conſider what was done to effect this.
                     To diſcharge man of that debt whereunto hee ſtood bound through ſinne vnto the iuſtice of God;What was done to obtaine forgiueneſſe for man. the Sonne of God muſt come downe from Heauen, and become a ſon of man, and in mans roome and ſteed he made ſinne, offering himſelfe vp a ſacrifice to ſatiſfie Gods iuſtice for mans ſinne. And that man might be made partaker of that which Chriſt did in this kind, Sonnes of men muſt be vnited to the Sonnne of God, by the Spirit of God; that as by the former vnion God and man became one perſon, ſo by this latter vnion, the ſonnes of men, and the Son of God, might make one body,1 Cor. 12. 12. 
                        which is, Chriſt.
                     
                     No creature but Man doth partake of Gods mercy in this kinde: vnſenſible, and vnreaſonable creatures are not ſubiect to ſin, nor yet to the eternall puniſhment of ſinne, becauſe they haue no immortall ſoules. The good Angels neuer ſinned, and in that reſpect had no need to taſte of this kind of mercy: whereupon when an Angell brought the newes of Chriſts birth,Luke 2. 10. he ſaith in the ſecond perſon,
To you, is borne a Sauiour: but when the Prophet a ſonne of man foretold thereof,Iſai. 9. 6. he ſaith in the firſt perſon, To vs a child is borne, To vs a Sonne is giuen. The euill Angels, that had as much need thereof as ſonnes of men,Iude v. 6. 
                        are reſerued in euerlaſting chaines vnder darkeneſſe, vnto the iudgement of the great day. This mercy is not vouchſafed vnto them, in regard whereof it is ſaid, that Chriſt tooke not on him the nature of Angels,
                        Heb. 2. 16. 
                        but he tooke on him the ſeede of Abraham. In this reſpect we may with an holy admiration cry out,Pſal. 8. 4. and ſay; What is man, that thou art mindfull of him? and the ſonne of man, that thou viſiteſt him?
                     
                     The reaſon why God ſhould thus reſpect man aboue all other creatures, cannot be fetched out of man. Man hath his being from god as well as other creatures; in his nature there is no ſuch excellency, as for it he ſhould be preferred before all others:Gen. 2. 7. for he was made of the duſt, and in his ſubſtance much inferiour to the Angels; neither can there be any merit or deſert in his actions: for in his beſt eſtate hee could doe no more then what of duty hee was bound vnto. But when God afforded him this great mercy, whereof we now ſpeake, he was dead in ſin, a ſlaue of Satan, an enemy of God. It was therefore Gods good pleaſure that made him thus to make choice of man, to make him the moſt principall obiect of his mercy; and in this reſpect the Apoſtle vſeth
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . a word, which ſignifieth a proper, and peculiar loue to man.
                        Tit. 3. 4.
                     
                     How doth this checke the ſonnes of men for their vngratefulneſſe againſt God?
                           Vſe 1. Reproofe of mans vngrate fulneſſe. whereas this proper and peculiar loue of God to man, ſhould prouoke him to exceede all other creatures in ſetting forth the honour and glory of God, who hath ſo reſpected him: Man for the moſt part diſhonoureth God more then all other creatures, except the infernall ſpirits, who wholy and onely ſet themſelues to diſhonour and blaſpheme the name of that great God, who reſerueth them in euerlaſting chaines. For if wee looke into the higheſt Heauens, there we ſhall ſee the heauenly Spirits ſtand before the Throne of God, ready to receiue and execute any charge that he ſhall giue them: yea, there we ſhall heare them ſinging continually praiſe vnto the Lord, and reioycing when God is any way glorified in Heauen or in earth. Doe any of the ſonnes of men ſo farre exceede the Angels in glorifying God, as Gods mercy hath more abounded to vs then to them? What we ſhall doe in Heauen I know not, but how farre ſhort the beſt of vs on earth doe come of them, none can be ignorant. Deſcend we therefore a little lower into the next heauens, where wee may behold the Sunne, Moone, Starres, and whole hoaſt of thoſe heauens keepe conſtantly that fixed order and courſe which at firſt their Maker appointed them: yea, the Moone in her changes, and the very wandring Starres in their wandring, obſerue the decree of the Creator, and ſtart not from that order which he hath ſet vnto them; and yet the ſonnes of men daily tranſgreſſe the Ordinances which the Lord their God hath giuen them. The very earth which was curſed for mans ſake, with little tillage bringeth forth all manner of needfull and pleaſant fruits for man: yet all the ſpirituall culture which God vſeth on the ſonnes of men, cannot make many of them bring forth good fruit. Reade Gods complaint to this purpoſe, in the long which was made to the Vineyard of the Lord.
                        Iſa. 5. 1, 2. &amp;c. The Prophet Iſayah noteth that the Oxe and the Aſſe (two of the moſt brutiſh creatures that be) take better notice of the kindneſſe of their Maſters,Iſa. 1. 3. then the Sonnes of Men doe of the mercies of the Lord to them.
                     Oh beloued,
                           Vſe 2▪ Exhortation to excell all creatures in obedience. let this peruerſeneſſe of our nature humble vs, and let vs endeauour to anſwere with gratefulneſſe Gods goodneſſe to vs. As he in mercy hath abounded towards vs aboue all other creatures, ſo let vs ſtriue to excell all in honouring him. Though notwithſtanding our vttermoſt endeauour we come much ſhort, yet let our true deſire mount aloft, and let vs ſtill endeauour to goe as farre as poſſibly we can, and euen moane againe, becauſe we cannot attaine to the perfection of the moſt perfect. This is that which is intended in the third petition of the Lords prayer, Thy will be done in earth as it is in Heauen.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 10. Of Gods impartiality in offering mercy without reſpect of perſons.
                     GOds mercy to Man is further amplified by the generality of the Obiect, which is firſt intimated by theſe indefinite words, Men, and Sonnes of Men: and then more expreſly noted by Saint Matthew vnder this generall particle (Whoſoeuer) whereby we are taught, that
                     God excludeth none from the participation of his mercy.
                     1 This doctrine is to be vnderſtood of Gods outward diſpenſation and manifeſtation of his mercy by the miniſtry of the Word,
                           Doct. In what reſpects pardon is offered to all. wherein no difference is made betwixt perſons, nor exemption of any; ſo as it calleth not into queſtion the ſecret counſell, and eternall decree of God.
                     2 It is to be referred to the ſeuerall degrees, ſorts, and conditions of men, betwixt which God maketh no difference, as honourable, meane, rich, poore, learned, vnlearned, olde, yong, free, bond, male, female, Magiſtrate, ſubiect, with the like.
                     3 It is to be applied to the all-ſufficiency of Chriſts ſacrifice, which is auailable to take away the ſinnes of the moſt notorious ſinners that can be (as we heard§. 6. before) as well as of any other ſinners.
                     Thus this doctrine rightly taken, is abundantly confirmed throughout the whole Scripture.Prou. 1 21. &amp; 9. 3, 4. 
                        Salomon brings in Wiſdome in the open ſtreetes, proclaiming mercy to all:Mar. 16. 15. and Chriſt commandeth his Apoſtles to Preach the Goſpell to euery creature: meaning euery reaſonable creature capable thereof. But more particularly and expreſly ſaith the Apoſtle;Rom. 10. 12. 
                        He that is Lord ouer all, is rich vnto all that call vpon him.
                        1 Tim. 2. 4. 6. And againe, God will that all men ſhall be ſaued: and Chriſt gaue himſelfe a ranſome for all men.
                     
                     For with God there is no reſpect of perſons;Reaſon. 1. hee hath not carnall eyes, nor ſeeth as man ſeeth: the ſoules of the meaneſt are as deare and precious to him, as the ſoules of the greateſt:Ezec. 18. 4. 
                        All ſoules are mine, ſaith the Lord.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 1 This further confirmeth that which was noted§. 6. before, that mans deſtruction is of himſelfe.
 No man can iuſtly blame God, who offereth mercy and pardon to euery one.
                     Let euery one of what ranke or condition ſoeuer he be,
                           Vſe 2 See more nerof 2. Treatiſe of Faith. §. 29. be encouraged to apply to himſelfe this glad tidings of pardon: and ſeeing God excludeth none, let not any of vs exclude our ſelues.
                  
                  
                     §. 11. Of the title SON OF MAN giuen to Chriſt.
                     THe laſt branch whereby Gods mercy in forgiuing ſin is amplified, reſpecteth the perſon againſt whom the ſinne is committed in this phraſe (Sonne of Man).
                     This title in Scripture is vſed ſometimes indefinitly,
                        To whom this title, Son of Man, is attributed. and ſometimes determinatly.
                     
                     
                        Indefinitly, in a double reſpect.
                     1 To ſet forth all mankind in generall,1 To mankind in generall. and ſo it compriſeth vnder it euery ſon of Adam, euery mothers childe (as we ſpeak). In which ſence Bildad vſeth it, where comparing mankind with the celeſtiall bodies, he ſaith, How much leſſe MAN a worme, euen the SONNE OF MAN, a worme?
                        Iob 25. 6.
                     
                     2 To deſigne corrupt and wicked men,2 To wicked men. in which ſence it is oppoſed to ſons of God: as where Moſes ſaith, that the ſonnes of God ſaw the DAVGHTERS OF MEN:Gen 6. 2. and Dauid his complaint, I lye among them that are ſet on fire, euen the SONNES OF MEN.Pſal. 57. 4.
                     
                     
                        Determinately and particularly it is attributed to the
Prophets of God, and to Chriſt the Sonne of God.
                     In the old Teſtament it is moſt vſually attributed to the Prophets,3 To Prophets. eſpecially when it is expreſſed in the ſingular number. Among other Prophets Ezechiel is moſt frequently ſtiled with this title, SONNE OF MAN: he is in his Propheſie ſo called almoſt an hundred times. The reaſon wherof I take to be this, He had viſions both more in number, and more rare in kinde, reuealed vnto him, then any other Prophet had: now leſt he ſhould be exalted out of meaſure through the abundance of reuelations, the Lord often putteth him in minde of his eſtate by nature, that he was but a ſonne of man, a mortall man, euen a worme.
                     In the new Teſtament it is moſt vſually attributed vnto Chriſt,4 To Chriſt. and that moſt frequently in the hiſtorie of the Euangeliſts, and when Chriſt ſpeaketh of himſelfe. Once Saint Stephen termeth Chriſt the Sonne of Man.
                        Act. 7. 56.
                     
                     
                         This title hath relation eſpecially to the humane nature of Chriſt,In what reſpect Chriſt is called Son of Man.
                         in regard whereof hee was borne of a woman, and ſo a true Son of Man: yet is it not to be reſtrained only to his Manhood; for it compriſeth vnder it the perſon of Chriſt, God and Man: elſe how could Chriſt while his humane nature was on earth ſay, The Sonne of Man is in heauen.
                        1. Ioh. 3. 13.
                     
                     The reaſon why this title is giuen to Chriſt,Reaſon why Chriſt is called Sonne of Man.
                         is not, (as ſome too nicely inferre, from the ſingular number) becauſe Chriſt was borne of a Virgin, and had but one Parent, and ſo was a ſonne of MAN, not of MEN, that is, onely of a mother, and not of father and mother both, as others are: For by the ſame reaſon it might be inferred that Ezechiel had but one parent, becauſe hee is called A ſonne of MAN: beſides, by this reaſon Chriſt ſhould bee called
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        A ſonne of woman, not a ſonne of man. But other better reaſons may be giuen of this title, as to ſhew
                     1 That Chriſt was true man.
                     2 That he came of the ſtock of man, and brought not his humane nature from heauen.
                     3 That he deſcended very low for our ſakes, being the
Sonne of God, to become a Sonne of Man. If any ſhall reply againſt this, and ſay, The title MAN might haue implied as much, I anſwere, that there is a farre greater emphaſis in this title Sonne of Man: as, according to the Hebrew phraſe it is more emphaticall to ſay, a ſonne of diſobedience, a ſonne of perdition, then a diſobedient and forlorne man.
                     
                     To apply that which hath been ſaid of this title, it is without all exception cleare, that by the Sonne of Man, is heere meant Chriſt Ieſus. For Chriſt neuer attributeth this title to any but to himſelf. Beſides, ſin and blaſphemy (which is heere ſaid to be committed againſt the Sonne of Man) is not properly committed againſt a meere man.
                     
                         In Chriſts manner of ſetting forth himſelfe vnder this title,Chriſts modeſtie. 
                        Sonne of Man, note his modeſtie and his humilitie.
                     Hee doth heere ſet himſelfe forth as God, that hath power to forgiue ſinnes (a great and excellent dignitie) and therefore ſpeaketh of himſelfe in the third Perſon, as of another. Behold his modeſtie.
                     There were many moſt excellent titles due and proper to him,Chriſts humilitie. which others attributed to him, as Sonne of God, King, Lord, Ieſus, Rabbi, and the like, but he himſelfe maketh choice of that which of all other was the meaneſt, and miniſtred leaſt matter of oſtentation. Behold his humilitie.
                     As theſe graces are to be admired in Chriſt, ſo are they to be imitated by vs.
                  
                  
                     §. 12. Of the particular reſpect wherein the title (Sonne of Man) is heere vſed.
                     HAuing ſpoken of this title, Sonne of Man, in generall, let vs now more diſtinctly and particularly conſider in what reſpect it is heere vſed.
                     Many take it heere by way of extenuation, as if Chriſt more largely had thus ſaid, Conſidering that the Son of God was pleaſed to take vpon him mans nature, and in that nature to appeare vnto men, and in ſuch a ſhape to appeare, as he could not be diſcerned, to be any other then a man, they which ſpeake againſt him, and blaſpheme him, may ſeeme to haue ſome pretext and excuſe, becauſe they knew him not to be the Sonne of God: and in that reſpect their ſin may be forgiuen them. They who take this title vſed heere in this ſence, illuſtrate their meaning with the ſimilitude of a Kings ſonne and heire, apparrelled with a beggers tagged ragges: if any of the ſubiects meeting him, but not knowing him, ſhould reuile him, and otherwiſe abuſe him, that ſubiect ſhould not be condemned of high treaſon: his ignorance of the perſon would extenuate his fact.
                     
                        Anſw. Though that ſimilitude doe fitly illuſtrate the pretended ſence and meaning of the words: yet this ſence is not pertinent to the preſent place and purpoſe of Chriſt.
                     The maine ſcope of Chriſt in this place is to aggrauate the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.Poſt vniuerſalem commenmorationem omnium peccatorū, omniſque blaſphemiae, eminentius voluit exprimere blaſphemiam quae fit contra filiu

                           t hominis. Aug. Serm. 15. de verb. Dom. But to compare it with a ſmall light ſinne, is no aggrauation. Wherefore, I rather take this title (Sonne of Man) in a contrary ſence, not in way of extenuation, but of aggrauation: whereunto it tendeth, if this title bee taken as ſetting forth on the one ſide the low degree of humiliation, whereunto Chriſt deſcended for our ſakes, together with the vnſpeakeable loue of God, in giuing his onely begotten Sonne to be a Sonne of Man; and on the other ſide mans light account, or rather plaine contempt of Chriſts abaſement, and of Gods kindneſſe: as if more largely and diſtinctly it had been thus ſaid, Though men, not in thought only, but by word and deed alſo, diſhonor and blaſpheme him, who is not onely the Almightie Creator of all things, but alſo the mercifull Redeemer of mankind, who being the eternall Sonne of God, for mans ſake became a Sonne of Man, and from the higheſt heauens deſcended into the loweſt parts of the earth, to deliuer them, who through feare of death were all their life time ſubiect to bondage, yet may this ſinne and this blaſphemie be forgiuen. To illuſtrate this with the forenamed ſimilitude;Simile. Suppoſe a Kings ſubiect be a gally-ſlaue, and to redeeme him, the King ſend his only ſonne, and this ſonne become a poore ſlaue to deliuer that ſubiect, and yet that ſubiect ſpeake againſt, reuile, and euill intreate this Prince, is not this more then monſtrous ingratitude? And is it not admirable goodneſſe in the King and Prince to forgiue that ingratitude? This is that goodneſſe of God which is intimated vnder this phraſe, Whoſoeuer ſhall ſpeake a word againſt the SONNE OF MAN, it ſhall be forgiuen him.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 13. Of Gods goodneſſe ouer comming mans vngratefulneſſe
                     THE Doctrine ariſing from the fore-named clauſe, is this:
                     Mans vngratef

                     Note how Dauid ſetteth forth Gods goodneſſe in this reſpect: for after hee had ſet forth the ingratitude of the Iſraelites in many reſpects,Pſal. 78. 38. concerning God he ſaith, Yet he being full of compaſsion forgaue their iniquitie. And again, after hee had ſhewed how they forgate God their Sauiour,

                        Ier. 3. 1. 
                        Thou hast played the harlot with many louers (a great point of ingratitude) yet turne againe to me, ſaith the Lord to rebellious Iſrael. But moſt euidētly is this proued by that mercy which was ſhewed to many thouſands of thoſe Iewes, who euilly intreated
the Sonne of Man,

                        a man approued of God among them by miracles, wonders and ſignes: And denied the Holy one and Iuſt, and deſired a murtherer to be granted vnto them: And killed the Prince of life.
                     
                     The Reaſon is euident.Reaſon. Gods goodneſſe ariſeth from himſelfe: and it is anſwerable to his greatneſſe. As mans vnworthineſſe hindreth not God to ſhew mercy to man at firſt, when he is dead in ſinne: ſo mans vngratefulneſſe ſtoppeth not the current of his mercie when it hath begun to flow forth: but like a flood of water it ouerfloweth all the dammes that are made againſt it by mans ingratitude: what God doth, he doth for his owne ſake.

 ſo heere behold long-ſuffering mixed with mercy▪
                         nothing commends ones patience more then abuſe of kindneſſe: By Gods ouercomming mans euill with his goodneſſe, he ſheweth himſelfe to be ſlow to anger, and that hee delighteth not in the death of ſinners.

                     A Generall vſe of all that hath been ſaid of the Mercy of God in forgiuing ſinnes,A Tranſition from Gods mercy to his iuſtice. euen all manner of ſinnes, not blaſphemies excepted, committed by any perſon, yea though the blaſpemie be vttered againſt the Sonne of Man, is to iuſtifie Gods ſeueritie againſt the ſinne and blaſphemie of the Holy Ghoſt. For which purpoſe, without queſtion, Chriſt hath heere ſo magnified the Mercy of God, as the like place is not to bee found throughout the whole Scripture. Wherefore hauing ſpoken of Gods mercy in pardoning euery ſinne but one, let vs conſider his Iuſtice in affording to pardon to that one ſin: which is the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                  
                     §. 14. Of abuſing Gods mercy.
                     IN that Chriſt inferreth the ſeueritie of Gods Iuſtice vpon the riches of his mercy, and after he had deliuered what he could of the Mercy of God, addeth a BVT (Euery ſin ſhall be forgiuen, BVT the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt ſhall neuer be forgiuen). He giueth vs to vndeſtand, that
                     Gods mercy and long-ſuffering may be ſo farre abuſed,
                           Doctr. Abuſe of mercie cauſeth extremity of iuſtice. as nothing but extremitie of iustice can be looked for. Thus much implieth the Apoſtle, where he ſaith, It is impoſsible that ſuch and ſuch ſhould be renewed: And againe, There remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſinne,Heb. 6 4, 6. &amp; 10. 26, 27. but a fearefull looking for of iudgement.Leu. 26. 23, 24 
                        The phraſes of Gods walking ſtubbornely againſt them that walke ſtubbornely againſt him,Pſal. 18. 26. and ſhewing himſelfe froward with the froward,1. Sam. 3. 14. and ſwearing that the iniquitie of men ſhall not bee purged with ſacrifice, nor offering for euer, with the like, doe alſo proue as much.
                     Gods mercy would be notoriouſly abuſed,Reaſon. if at ſome times, and in ſome caſes, the very extremitie of iuſtice ſhould not be executed. It ſtandeth much with the honor of God, to ſhew himſelfe ſometimes a God of vengeance, and a conſuming fire.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         Take wee heed therefore how we goe too farre in abuſing Gods lenity and patience,
 leſt we depriue our ſelues of all the fruit and benefit thereof: and inſteede of being the principall obiect of Gods mercy, we make our ſelues the principall obiect of his mercy. A man may ſo farre proceede in ſinning againſt the Sonne of Man, as by degrees fall into the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt. The fearefulneſſe of which eſtate followeth now to bee declared.
                  
                  
                     §. 15. Of the obiect of the vnpardonable ſinne. The Holy Ghoſt.
                     IN handling the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, wee are to conſider

                           1 The Nature
                           
                           2 The Iſſue

                     The Nature of the finne is ſet foorth vnder the names giuen to it. It is by
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Saint Matthew termed the blaſphemy of the Holy Ghoſt, and a ſpeaking againſt the Holy Ghost. By Saint Marke,
                        
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        a blaſpheming against the Holy Ghost. In all which phraſes are noted forth, both the Obiect, and the
Qualitie of that ſinne.
                     The Obiect, againſt which in ſpeciall this ſinne is directed and committed, is the Holy Ghoſt. And in this reſpect Saint Matthew calleth it the blaſphemie of the Holy Ghoſt: not as if it were in the Holy Ghoſt, which is blaſphemie to thinke, but becauſe (as the other phraſes doe expreſly declare) it is againſt the Holy Ghoſt. In this ſence this kinde of phraſe is oft vſed: for where it ſaid that Chriſt gaue his Diſciples power against vncleane ſpirits (as it is well tranſlated according to the meaning of the phraſe) word for word it is in the originall Power of vncleane ſpirits.
                        Matth. 10. 1. This I haue the rather noted,Marke 6. 7. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . to mollifie the phraſe of ſome, who ſpeaking, preaching and writing of this ſinne, ſtile it The ſinne of the Holy Ghoſt: which ſpeech being well taken (the Holy Ghoſt being conceiued to bee not the ſubiect, but the Obiect thereof) it may ſafely bee vſed.
                     Now the Holy Ghost is made the Obiect of this ſinne, not in regard of his Eſſence, or Perſon, but in regard of his
Office and Operation.
                     
                     
                         The Holy Ghoſt, in regard of his Eſſence, is all one with the Father and the Sonne: all the three Perſons are one in nature and eſſence, all one God: in which reſpect a ſinne committed againſt any one, is committed againſt euery one of the three Perſons.
                     The Holy Ghost also in regard of his Perſon, is the Spirit of the Father, and of the Son, proceedigg from them both, and no way greater then the Father or the Sonne: they are all in dignitie coequall: ſo as in this reſpect a ſin againſt the Holy Ghost cannot be greater then againſt the
Father and the Sonne.
                     
                     But there is an office and operation peculiarly in Scripture attributed to each Perſon. The peculiar office and operation attributed to the Spirit, is,
                     1 To inlighten mens mindes with the knowledge of the Goſpell, and to reueale vnto them the good will of God, and way to happineſſe, in which reſpect he is called
The Spirit of reuelation.
                        Epheſ. 1. 17.
                     
                     2 To perſwade their harts of the truth of thoſe things which he hath reuealed to their vnderſtanding, by vertue whereof,Heb. 6. 5. men are ſaid to taſte of the good Word of God, after that they are made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt.
                     3 To mooue them to acknowledge and profeſſe the Goſpell to bee the Word of God, which is implied by the Apoſtle vnder this phraſe of receiuing the knowledge of the truth.
                        Heb. 10. 26.
                     
                     There are alſo many other workes of the Spirit, but theſe are the moſt pertinent vnto our purpoſe, and will giue light vnto all the reſt.
                     The ſinne heere noted to be committed againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is committed againſt him, in regard of the forenamed operations of the Spirit, ſo as it is againſt that truth of God, which the Spirit hath reuealed to a man, and euicted and perſwaded his heart of the certaintie thereof, ſo as in his heart he cannot but acknowledge, that it is an euident and vndeniable truth, and is oft moued with his mouth to profeſſe as much.
                  
                  
                     §. 16. Of the qualitie of the ſinne against the Holy Ghost.
                     THe Quality (or effect of this ſinne: for the ſin it ſelfe is ſeated principally in the heart) is ſpeaking againſt, and blaſphemie. This latter word expoundeth the former. For it is not euery kind of ſpeaking againſt, but an ignominious, approbrious, diſpitefull ſpeaking againſt: which is
blaſphemie. For blaſphemie is heere taken in the vttermoſt extent thereof, and that both in regard of the matter, which is to deny the euidence of the Spirit, and alſo in regard of the manner, which is to doe it with diſgracefull, and deſpitefull ſpeeches, to the open diſhonour of God, and of his Goſpell, and of the Spirit, which hath giuen vndoubted euidence of the power of God: as the Scribes and Phariſies, who did not only deny that Chriſt caſt out diuels by the finger and power of God: but alſo moſt reproachfully and ſlanderouſly ſaid,Matth. 12. 24. 
                        This fellow doth not caſt out diuels, but by Beel-zebub the Prince of diuels: And againe,Mark. 3. 30.
                        He hath an vncleane ſpirit.
                     
                  
                  
                     §. 17. Of the definition of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghost.
                     THe words and phraſes whereby Chriſt ſetteth foorth the nature of this ſin, being expounded, wee may out of them gather this definition.
                     The ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt is a deſpitefull reiecting of the Goſpell, after that the Spirit hath ſupernaturally perſwaded a mans heart of the truth and benefit thereof.
                     
                         TheGenus. 
                        generall matter of this definition, is, a reiecting of the Goſpell.
                     
                     TheForma. 
                        particular forme, whereby this ſinne is diſtinguiſhed from other ſinnes, is in the other words.
                     For the matter.
                     
                     The Goſpell is it,Of the Goſpel, ſee Treat, 2. part. 5. §. 4. againſt which this ſinne in particular is directed, and not euery part of Gods word. By the Goſpell, I meane that part of Gods word, which God hath reuealed for mans ſaluation, euen after his fall: and in that reſpect commonly called the glad tidings of ſaluation. So as the very obiect matter, whereabout this ſinne is occupied, doth in part diſcouer the hainouſneſſe thereof, and declare a reaſon why it is not pardoned.
                     To oppoſe againſt any part of Gods truth,Of Gods truth, ſee Treat. 2. part. 6. §. 27. is a monſtrous and hainous ſinne: for an eſpeciall part of Gods honor conſiſteth in his truth, which is as deare and precious to him, as any thing can be: to gain-ſay it, is to deny him to be God:Pſal. 31. 5. for he is ſtiled, The Lord God of truth. But to gain-ſay the Goſpell, that part of Gods truth wherein
Ieſus who was ſent to ſaue his people from their ſins,
                        Matth. 1. 21. wherein the riches of Gods mercy, &amp; wherein the
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . 
                        peculiar loue of God to man is reuealed, and that for mans good, euen for his eternall ſaluation, is more then monſtrous. For this is not onely a denying of Gods truth, but of his mercy alſo: yea (if we well conſider the extent of the Goſpell) of the wiſdome, power, iuſtice, and all other properties of God. It addeth vnto other ſins (to make vp the heape of them) ingratitude. It taketh away the meanes of pardon and life: for in the Goſpell, onely in the Goſpell is pardon offered, and life to bee found; without it, is nothing but death and damnation. When the Goſpell is not receiued, what hope can there be of pardon? This is it that bringeth God (who by a ſolemne oath hath proteſted,Ezek. 33. 11. that he deſireth not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked ſhould turne from his way and liue) to complaine and ſay
What could I haue done any more,
                        Iſa. 5. 4. 
                        that I haue not done? If not to receiue the Goſpell be a deadly and damnable ſinne, what is to reiect it. To reiect a thing is more then not to receiue it: it is to put it away, as the Iewes, who in that reſpect are ſaid to iudge themſelues vnworthy of euerlaſting life.
                        Act. 13. 46. Simile.
                         It is as if traytors and rebels being riſen vp againſt their Soueraigne, and hee offering pardon vnto them, if they would lay downe their weapons, and turne to bee loyall ſubiects; they ſhould reiect his gratious offer, and ſay they wil none of his fauour, they care not for pardon: they had rather be hanged, drawne, and quartered, then be beholding to him for fauour and pardon. Doth not this reiecting of fauour much aggrauate the crime? Yea, is not this a more hainous crime then the treaſon and rebellion it ſelfe?
                     Hereinto all that commit the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt do fall: but yet all that fall thereinto do not commit that ſinne. For as none that periſh in their ſin receiue the Goſpell, ſo all incredulous perſons which liue vnder the Goſpel, and miniſtry thereof, whereby pardon is proclaimed and offered vnto them, do refuſe and reiect it: ſo as this part of the generall matter of this ſinne is common to all that, at leaſt liuing vnder the miniſtry of the Goſpel, beleeue not.
                     In the definition of this ſinne, wee further added this word, Deſpitefull: which alſo appertaineth to the generall matter thereof.
                     To reiect the Goſpel deſpitefully, doth make the matter much more deſperate: for it implieth an inbred hatred againſt the Goſpell it ſelfe, the Word of ſaluation: whence proceed open blaſphemies againſt God and his Word, and fierce and cruell perſecuting of the Preachers, and profeſſors of the Goſpell.
                     This deſpitefulneſſe added to reiecting of the Goſpell, brings a man into a moſt fearefull and deſperate eſtate: yet all that aſcend to this high pitch of impiety, doe not ſimply therein ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt: for all this may be done on ignorance. Inſtance Pauls example: he was ſo zealous of the traditions which the Iewes receiued from their Elders, as he hated the Goſpell, which he deemed to be contrary thereunto:Act. 26. 9. in which reſpect, Hee thought that he ought to doe many things contrary to the name of Ieſus:
                        Act. 9. 1, 13, 21 and ſo he did: for out of his inward hatred Hee breathed out threatnings and ſlaughter againſt the Diſciples of the Lord: he did much euill to the Saints: hee deſtroyed them that called on the name of Ieſus: hee compelled many to blaſpheme,
                        Act. 26. 11.
                        and waxed mad againſt the Saints: yea, he himſelfe was a blaſphemer.
                        1. Tim. 1. 13. But all theſe he did ignorantly: for a man may hate and blaſpheme that which hee knoweth not. Great was that deſpite which many of the Iewes ſhewed againſt Chriſt, and againſt Stephen:
                        Act
                              •
                            7. 55▪
                         
                        They were cut to the heart, and gnaſhed at Stephen with their teeth:
                        Luke 23. 34. yet both Chriſt and Stephen prayed for them:Act. 7. 60. which they would not haue done,1. Ioh. 5. 16. if they had ſinned the ſinne vnto death, becauſe it is forbidden ſo to doe.
                     Thus much of the generall matter of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt: wherein other ſins may agree with it.
                     The particular forme whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from all other ſinnes, is in theſe words (After that the Spirit hath ſupernaturally perſwaded a mans heart of the truth and benefit thereof.) Out of which I gather theſe concluſions, concerning the perſons that commit this ſinne.
                     1 They muſt haue knowledge of the Goſpell: their iudgement muſt be euicted of that truth which they oppoſe: whereby they come to ſinne againſt their owne knowledge and iudgement.
                     2 This knowledge muſt not onely ſwimme in the braine, but alſo worke vpon their will, and diue into their heart: ſo as their will giue conſent, and their heart aſſent to what their iudgement coneiueth to bee true. There muſt be a perſwaſion as well as knowledge; whereby they come to ſinne againſt conſcience, that iudge which God hath placed in mens ſoules to accuſe or excuſe them.
                     3 This knowledge and perſwaſion muſt be wrought not onely by euidence of vndeniable arguments, (for ſo an Heathen man may be euicted, and perſwaded) but alſo by a ſupernaturall and inward worke of Gods Spirit, whereby they are in their very ſoules perſwaded that they gain-ſay the vndoubted word of God, and ſo ſin againſt the worke of the Spirit in them.
                     4 This inward ſupernaturall perſwaſion muſt bee of the benefit of the Word, as well as of the truth thereof: that the Word which they deſpitefully gain-ſay, is the Word of ſaluation (which, whoſoeuer beleeueth, ſhall not periſh, but haue life euerlaſting) and the only meanes of ſaluation (whoſoeuer reiecteth it, ſhall be damned.) Thus in ſinning againſt the forenamed worke of the Spirit, they ſinne againſt their owne ſoules, and bring ſwift damnation vpon themſelues.
                     Briefly to ſumme vp all that hath been deliuered of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt: It conſiſteth of theſe degrees.
                     1 A reiecting of the Goſpell:
                        Heb. 10. 28, 29. which the Apoſtle in his deſcription of this ſinne euidently noteth: for firſt hee maketh an oppoſition betwixt deſpiſers of the Law, and deſpiſers of that againſt which they ſin, that fall into this vnpardonable ſin: now what can that which is oppoſed to the Law be,Verſ. 29. but the Goſpell? Againe, his deſcription of that which is deſpiſed, can agree to nothing ſo wel as to the Goſpell.
                     2 A deſpitefull reiecting thereof,
                        Ibid. which the ſame Apoſtle noteth vnder theſe phraſes, a treading vnder foote: counting an vnholy thing; deſpiting.
                     
                     Vnder this clauſe are compriſed malice &amp; hatred of hart, blaſphemie of the tongue, and perſecution, in all which the Scribes and Phariſies manifeſted great deſpight againſt Chriſt: ſo haue all others that euer committed this ſinne. In this reſpect the Apoſtle calleth them aduerſaries.
                        Verſ. 27.
                     
                     3 A deſpitefull reiecting of the Goſpell againſt knowledge: which the Apoſtle expreſſely noteth in this phraſe,
after we haue receiued the knowledge of the truth.
                        Verſ. 26.
                     
                     4 A deſpitefull reiecting of the Goſpell againſt conſcience: which the Apoſtle implieth vnder this word Wilfully.
                     
                     5 A wilfull gainſaying and oppoſing againſt the inward operation, and ſupernatural reuelation of the Holy Ghoſt: which is noted by the Apoſtle vnder this phraſe, Hath done deſpite vnto the Spirit of grace.
                        Verſ. 29.
                     
                     6 A deſpiting of the Spirit in ſuch things as he reuealeth to them for their owne good, euen the ſaluation of their ſoules: this is compriſed vnder thoſe phraſes of taſting the heauenly gift,
                        Heb. 6. 4, 5. 
                        the good word of God, and powers of the world to come, which they doe, as it were, ſpit out againe.
                  
                  
                     §. 18. Of the difference betwixt the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and other ſinnes.
                     BY the forenamed definition may the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt be diſtinguiſhed from many other ſinnes which come neere vnto it, as,
                     1 From many ſinnes againſt knowledge: yea and againſt conſcience alſo: for they may be without malice of heart, which this cannot be. The elect may fall into them: but not into this.2. Sam. 24. 4. 
                        Dauid and Peter ſinned both againſt knowledge,Mat. 26. 69. and alſo againſt conſcience.
                     2 From many ſins committed on malice againſt Chriſt and his Goſpell:1. Tim. 1. 13. which may be done on ignorance.
                     3 From blaſphemie and perſecution: which may be done alſoIbid. on ignorance,2. Cro. 16. 10 or in paſſion.
                     4 From deniall of Chriſt, which may be done on feare (inſtance Peters example) or other like temptations.Mat. 26. 69. It is an ancient hereſie of the Nouatians to deny repentance and pardon to ſuch as haue once denied Chriſt.Aug. lib. de her. &amp; lib. de quaeſt.
                     
                     5 From Apoſtaſie from the faith, and profeſſion of religion, which alſo may bee done not on malice, but through the violence of ſome temptation. It is noted of
Salomon,
                        1. King. 11. 4, 5, 6. that he continued not to follow the Lord, but turned after other gods, through the perſwaſion of his wiues. When a Kingdome changeth Religion, as England in Queene
Maries dayes, many prooue Apoſtates, and fall away from the profeſſion of the Goſpell, and profeſſe idolatrie for feare of perſecution, or for too much loue of this world, to hold their places and offices, their honors and dignities, their houſes and lands, or elſe on an infirme and weake perſwaſion, that they can keepe their hearts pure, and their faith ſound, though with their bodies they outwardly ſubiect themſelues to idolatry. The Leuites which in the captiuite fell away,Ezek. 44. 10. &amp;c. though they were barred from medling with the holy things, yet they were admitted to doe other ſeruices in the Temple, whereby it is manifeſt that they fell not into this vnpardonable ſinne.
                     6 From Preſumption and ſinning with an high hand, as Manaſſeh did.2. Cro. 33. 13.
                     
                     7 From Hardneſſe of heart,
                        Ephe. 4. 17. 18 
                        from impudencie, and committing ſin with greedineſſe. For ſo did the Gentiles which had not the Goſpell ſupernaturally reuealed vnto them.
                     8 From Infidelitie and impenitencie, yea from finall infidelitie and impenitencie, whereinto all the reprobate fall. If finall impenitencie ſhould be the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt (as ſome do take it) then ſhould euery one that is damned ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt: yea then could not this ſinne be committed till death: and then in vaine ſhould the caueat of Saint Iohn be,1. Ioh. 5. 16. concerning not praying for them.
                  
                  
                     §. 19. Of the perſons that may fall into the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                     HAuing ſeene what the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt is,Whether the Scribes and Phariſies blaſphemed the holy Ghoſt, or noe. for application of the point to the parties with whom Chriſt had to do, we will in the next place diſcuſſe whether the Scribes and Phariſies that ſlandered Chriſt, committed this ſinne or noe.
                     Many ſay they did not commit this ſin: and to prooue their aſſertion, they vſe theſe two arguments.
                     1 They neuer profeſſed Chriſt.
                     2 Chriſt prayed for them.Luke 23. 34.
                     
                     To the firſt I anſwere, that two ſorts of people may fall into this ſinne: namely, they who profeſſe Chriſt and his Goſpell, and they who neuer profeſſed it.
                     Profeſſors that ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,Who are Apoſtates. are called
Apoſtates, that is, departers away, namely, from the faith, or from the profeſſion of the Goſpell (for the Greeke word,2. Theſ. 2. 3. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . which according to the notation of it, ſignifieth Apoſtaſie, is tranſlated a departing, and a falling away) not that all who depart away, and in that generall ſence are called Apoſtates, doe commit this ſin, as was noted§. 18. before: but becauſe they that fall into this ſin, are moſt notorious Apoſtates: denying the truth, not in tongue only, but in heart alſo: not through feare, but in malice, vtterly renouncing, and bidding defiance to the faith: not contenting themſelues to deny it, but ſhewing themſelues deadly enemies againſt it, and perſecuting all that are friends vnto it: hauing in that reſpect a very diabolicall propertie, not enduring that any ſhould reap benefit by that which they haue reiected: ſuch an Apoſtate was
Alexander the Copper-ſmith, and Iulian.
                        2. Tim. 4. 14.
                     
                     They who neuer profeſſed the truth of the Goſpell,They who neuer profeſſed the Goſpell may ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt. may alſo ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, as they doe to whom the Spirit hath ſo clearely and ſupernaturally reuealed the truth of the Goſpell, as their heart and conſcience doth inwardly tell them that they ought to make profeſſion thereof, yet their malice againſt it, not onely keepeth them from profeſſing it, but alſo maketh them to reuile it,Tit. 3. 11. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . and to perſecute the profeſſors of it. The Apoſtle ſaith of ſuch an one; that he is condemned of himſelfe. Such were the Scribes and Phariſies which blaſphemed Chriſt: and ſuch are many of the learneder Papiſts.
                     The difference betwixt theſe two ſorts, is that the former hath gone a ſtep further in ſhew of goodneſſe, but thereby haue made their fall the more offenſiue, and their ſinne the greater, in that to the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, they haue added Apoſtaſie, as ſome adde oppreſſion, murther, and the like.
                     To the ſecond argument,Whether Chriſt prayed for them that blaſphemed his workes. Luke 23. 34. to proue that the forenamed Scribes and Phariſies ſinned not againſt the holy Ghoſt, taken from Chriſts prayer, I anſwere that Chriſt prayed not in particular for theſe, but for ſuch as were indeed in the outward act aſſociates, but not of ſo euill a diſpoſition as they. As among Papiſts blinde zeale moueth many to doe that, which deadly malice moueth others to doe.
                     
                         I doubt not but we may,Reaſons that the Scribes and Phariſie ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt. according to the truth of the matter, conclude that the forenamed Scribes and Phariſies ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt: for
                     1 The Goſpell was preached to them by Iohn the
Baptiſt, Chriſt, and his Diſciples, yet they receiued it not, but refuſed and reiected it.
                     2 They did it deſpitefully, as their carriage ſheweth.
                     3 They blaſphemed Chriſt, as we haue heard before, and they perſecuted him and his Diſciples.
                     4 They did all this againſt knowledge and againſt conſcience:Matth. 12. 27. as the inſtance which Chriſt giueth, of their iuſtifying that in their children, which they condemned in Chriſt:Matth. 21. 38. yea they could ſay of Chriſt, This is the heire.
                     
                     5 They did all, alſo, after the Spirit had ſupernaturally reuealed Chriſt vnto them: for it is noted that Ieſus knew their thoughts,
                        Matth. 12. 25. Verſ. 31. and thereupon hee accuſed them of blaſpheming the Holy Ghoſt: he knew their thoughts, that is, he knew how far the Spirit had wrought in them, and how they ſtriued againſt, and reſiſted the Spirit, and in that reſpect accuſeth them of this blaſphemie.
                     Laſtly, to put the matter out of all doubt, after that Chriſt had ſet out this ſin, Saint Marke addeth this clauſe,
Becauſe they ſaid he had an vncleane ſpirit.
                        Marke. 3. 30. Implying by that inference, that, that blaſphemie was in them an euidence of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                  
                  
                     §. 20. Of the meaning of theſe words, SHALL NOT, and SHALL NEVER be forgiuen,
                     THe ſecond generall point, noted by Chriſt, about the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is the Iſſue thereof:
                     which is ſet downe
Negatiuely: Affirmatiuely.
                     
                     
                        
                        Negatiuely, both by Saint Marke in theſe words (hath neuer forgiueneſſe) and alſo by S. Matthew in theſe words (ſhall not be forgiuen vnto men) which is further amplified by a diſtinction of times, in theſe words (neither in this world, nor in the world to come).
                     
                        Affirmatiuely, onely by Saint Marke, in theſe words (is in danger of eternall damnation).
                     The ſentence and doome which Chriſt in all theſe words and phraſes hath giuen of this ſinne, is very perſpicuous and cleare, but that Papiſts haue brought a cloud of obſcuritie vpon them, by the vapours of their falſe gloſſes and hereſies: which we will firſt remoue, and then declare the fearefull iſſue of this ſinne.
                     Firſt, the Papiſts cleane ouerthrow the maine point heere intended,Bellar. tom. 3. contr. 4. de paenit. lib. 2. cap. 16. Ianſen. Concor. Euang. cap. 49. by interpreting the indefinite negatiue particle (not) and the generall negatiue (neuer) to as if a
difficultie onely, and not an impoſsibility were intended, as if Chriſt had ſaid, the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt ſhall
not eaſily, but very hardly be forgiuen: or, ordinarily and for the moſt part, it ſhall not be forgiuen. But the words are more cleare, then ſo to be obſcured. For, Not, Neuer, Nor in this world, nor in the world to come: are much more then
not ordinarily, not eaſily, hardly, and for the moſt part. Beſides, if there were not an impoſſibilitie of the pardon of it, prayer might be made for the partie that committeth it,
1. Ioh. 5. 16. which may not be done. But as this text is cleare enough to ſuch as haue not contentious and captious ſpirits, ſo there are other texts which put the point more out of all doubt and queſtion: as where the Apoſtle ſaith, It is impoſsible to renew them againe:
                        Heb. 6. 4 6. &amp; 10. 26, 27. And againe, There remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſinnes, but a fearefull looking for of iudgement, and fiery indignation.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 21. Of the errors which Papiſts gather from this phraſe, nor in the World to come.
                     AGaine, Papiſts roue farre beyond the ſcope of Chriſt in this place, by inferring from this clauſe (nor in the World to come) that ſome ſinnes which are not forgiuen in this World,Bellar. de Purgat. lib. 1. ca. 4. 11. may be forgiuen in the World to come: whence they further inferre, that there is a Purgatory after this life; and render theſe reaſons of this latter inference: Firſt, that into Heauen can enter no vncleane thing. Secondly, that out of hel there can be no redemption: therefore (ſay they) there muſt needs be a Purgatory, by which they which die in their ſinnes muſt be purged, and out of which they whoſe ſinnes are forgiuen after this life, muſt be deliuered.
                     
                        Anſw.
                        Reu. 21. 27. The two poſitions which are laide downe for reaſons, are ſound and true: for neither can any vncleane thing enter into Heauen, nor can any that are once caſt into hell, be euer deliuered out of it; for the Scripture termeth their paine euerlaſting:
                        Mat. 25. 46. Papiſts make lewd ſinners Saints in heauen. and yet the Papiſts are not conſtant in thoſe aſſertions, but deliuer many points contrary to them both: as that many who for treaſons, rebellions, and ſuch like damnable ſinnes are executed, and die without repentance for them, die Martyrs, and are immediatly carried to glory: is not this to thruſt vncleane birds into Heauen. And againe, that many who died in mortall ſinnes,Papiſts teach that ſome haue beene deliuered out of hell. and ſo by their owne poſitions went to hell, were deliuered from thence. Some of the inſtances which their owne writers haue giuen hereof, are theſe:Ioh. Damaſc. in orat. de mortuis. 
                        The ſoule of Falconilla a Pagan, was freed from hell by the prayers of Saint Thecla, and
                        Ibid. 
                        the ſoule of Traiane a Pagan Emperour, by the prayers of Pope Gregorie, and
                        Greg. lib. 1. dialog. cap. 12. 
                        a certaine lewde man carried by the Diuels into hell, was deliuered by Saint Sereus.
                     
                     
                         But to paſſe by theſe lying fables, the conſequences which from the forenamed ſound poſitions they gather, are moſt vnſound, and abſurd; namely, that there is a purgatory, (of which fiction I haue ſpokenTreat. 3. of Prayer. §. 40. before) and that ſinnes may be forgiuen after this life: a point which (as was ſaid before) they gather from this phraſe (nor in the World to come.)Rhemiſts on Mat. 12. 32.) The falſhood whereof is eaſily diſcouered by a due conſideration of the true meaning of the words.
                  
                  
                     §. 22. Of the true meaning of this phraſe, nor in this world, nor in the world to come.
                     THe Greeke word,
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            ſeculum. and the Latin alſo, which we tranſlate
World, ſignifieth rather time, then place. By this World, is meant the time of a mans life here vpon earth: by the World to come, all the time from his death proceeding on without end to eternity. Two Worlds are in Scripture giuen to euery man to be in, one from the time of his conception, or birth, to his death; the other from thence for euer: for after death there is no alteration of a mans eſtate. But becauſe the manifeſtation of that perpetuall and eternall eſtate is at the great day of iudgement, when all ſhall ſtand before their Iudge, and receiue their doome, the beginning of that age, or world to come, is commonly reckoned from the day of iudgement: in which reſpect Chriſt ioyneth that world, and the reſurrection from the dead together.
                        Luk. 20. 35. Which being ſo, it is as euident as may be, that no ſinne can be forgiuen in the World to come.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     §. 23. Of the many anſwers which may be giuen againſt the Papiſts collection concerning forgiueneſſe of ſinnes in the World to come.
                     BVtfully to diſcouer the erroneous collection of Papiſts touching forgiueneſſe of ſinnes after death, out of this phraſe (nor in the World to come.) Let it be noted that
                     1 Saint Marke,
                        Mar. 3. 29. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
                         the beſt interpreter of Saint Matthew, expoundeth that phraſe by this generall particle, NEVER, or in no age.
                     
                     2 They cannot ſhew that the world to come is any where taken for the time that paſſeth betwixt this life ended, and the day of iudgement, which is the time appointed by them for remiſſion of ſinnes in Purgatory: for they hold that at the day of iudgement that fire ſhall be put out; andExtendere tempora purgatory vltra diem reſurrectionis eſt error exploratus. Bellar. de purg. lib. 2. cap. 9. that it is a manifeſt error to extend the time of Purgatory beyond the day of the reſurrection.
                     3 If it were granted that by the World to come, is meant the time betwixt death and iudgement, yet may it be applied to the very end or paſſing away of the former World, and beginning or entrance into the other World; namely, for the very moment of death, as if he had ſaid, this ſinne ſhall not be forgiuen, either in the time of this life, or at the point of death, when a man is entring into another World. Thus theCompare Mat. 28. 1. with Luke 24. 1. 
                        euening of the Sabbath is called
the firſt day of the weeke.
                     
                     4 The remiſsion here ſpoken of in the World to come, may bee taken for the manifeſtation and ratification of that which was granted before: as if he had thus ſaid, As in this World he ſhall receiue no remiſsion, ſo in the World to come when all ſhall ſtand vpon their triall to be acquitted, or condemned, no remiſsion ſhall be pronounced to him, but he ſhall receiue the ſentence of condemnation.
                     
                     5 This phraſe (ſhall not be forgiuen) may figuratiuely be put for the effect that followeth vpon ſinne not forgiuen, namely, iuſt vengeance, and ſo the meaning may be this;
Iuſt vengeance ſhall bee executed vpon him both in this world, and in the world to come; as euer hath beene executed on all ſuch as ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                     
                     6 It is no good conſequence from a negatiue to inferre the contrary affirmatiue. What if Chriſt had ſaid that Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall neuer be forgiuen, neither on earth, nor in hell; would it from thence follow that ſome ſinnes may be forgiuen in hell?
                     7 Chriſt comparing this ſinne which ſhall not be forgiuen
in this world, or in the world to come, with blaſphemy againſt the Sonne of Man, by the conſequence which they inferre, it would follow that blaſphemy againſt the Sonne may be forgiuen in the world to come; which is directly againſt their owne principles: for all blaſphemy is a mortall ſinne; but they ſayPurgatorium projis tantum eſt qui cum venialibus culpis moriuntur. Bellar. de Purg. lib. 2. cap. 1. that Purgatory is onely for them who die in veniall ſinnes.
                     8 If any ſinnes might be forgiuen in the world to come, by the order of the words in this phraſe, (nor in this world, nor in the world to come) it would follow that the more hainous ſinnes ſhould be forgiuen in the world to come: elſe Chriſt would haue ſaid, Nor in the world to come, nor in this world.
                     
                     9 Chriſt here ſpeaketh of remitting the Fault: but by their doctrine onely the puniſhment is remitted after this life: for they acknowledge thatCulpas ipſas. Catholici omnes Chriſti ſan, guine purgari affirmant. Bellar. de paen. lib. 1. cap. 2. the very faults themſelues are purged by the blood of Chriſt, and that they who in this life haue not the fault remitted, can haue no hope of eternall life. This place therefore ſpeaking of forgiuing the fault, how can they apply it to the puniſhment?
                  
                  
                     §. 24. Of the reaſons why this phraſe (nor in this world, nor in the world to come) is vſed.
                     
                        Queſt. IF no ſin can be forgiuen in the world to come, why is this clauſe (nor in the World to come) added?
                     
                        Anſw. Though no reaſon could be giuen, yet we may not from thence inferre a paradox, and an error contrary to other places of Scripture. But among other reaſons two eſpecially may be noted to make the phraſe the more perſpicuous.
                     1 To aggrauate the terror of the iudgement here denounced againſt ſuch as ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt: for the very conſideration of this, that both in this world, and in the world to come, they lie vnder the fiery wrath, and heauy vengeance of God, cannot be but very fearefull and terrible.
                     2 To ſhew the miſery of theſe ſinners aboue others:Difference betwixt ſinners. for,
                     1 There be ſome who keeping ſinne vnder, and giuing raines thereto, but walking by faith vprightly before the Lord, are neither puniſhed in this world, nor in the world to come.Gen. 5. 24. Such an one was Enoch.
                     
                     2 There be others that are not ſo watchfull ouer themſelues, but through ſecurity ſuffer ſinne to get ſome head ouer them, for which they are puniſhed in this world, but truly repenting,1 Cor. 5. 5. are not condemned in the world to come. Such an one was the inceſtuous perſon, both excommunicated, and alſo reſtored by the Apoſtle. Such alſo were many of thoſe who diſcerned not the Lords body when they came to the holy Communion.1 Cor. 11. 30. &amp;c.
                     
                     3 There be others alſo, who though they be impenitent ſinners, yet through Gods indulgency are ſuffered to enioy outward peace and proſperity in this world, and feele the ſmart of their ſinne onely in the world to come. Such were they whom Iob noteth to die in all eaſe and proſperity:
                        Iob 21. 23. and ſuch an one was Diues.
                        Luk. 16. 19. 23
                     
                     4 But they that ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, are made a ſpectable of Gods vengeance, both in this world, and in the world to come:Mat. 27. 5. as Iudas, Iulian, and ſuch other.
                  
                  
                     §. 25. Of ſeeking pardon for ſinne in this life.
                     THus we haue ſeene what ſmall reaſon Papiſts haue to gather frō this text, that ſin may be forgiuen after death.
                     
                     For our parts let vs giue no reſt to our ſoules,Exhortation to ſeeke pardon while we liue. till wee haue aſſurance of the pardon of all our ſinnes, applying to our ſelues the ſacrifice of Chriſt for all our ſins whatſoeuer, and let vs vnfainedly turne from them all while here we liue;Luke 12. 5. fearing him who after he hath killed the body, hath power to caſt both body and ſoule into hell. And let vs not fondly dreame of mercy (like the fiue fooliſh Virgins) when it is too late.Mat. 25. 11. The time that the Goſpell is preached, and thereby remiſſion of ſinnes offered, is the
accepted time, the day of ſaluation:
                        2 Cor. 6. 2. and the time of this life, the onely time of repentance. If the Lord be not then found, he will neuer be found. Wherefore ſeeke the Lord while he may be found;
                        Iſay 55. 6. and to day, while it is called to day, harden not your hearts.

                     §. 26. Of the ſence wherein it is ſaid that the ſinne againſt the Holie Ghost ſhall not be pardoned.
                     BVt to returne to our matter. Notwithſtanding the falſe gloſſes of Papiſts on this Text, it is moſt euident and cleare, both by the words of Chriſt, and alſo by other Texts of Scripture, noted§ 20. before, that the ſinne againſt the Holie Ghoſt neither ſhall, nor can euer be pardoned.
                         This ſinne is not onely in the iſſue and euent vnpardoned, but in the nature and kind of it vnpardonable. And herein ſtandeth the difference which Chriſt here maketh betwixt this ſinne, and all other ſinnes. In regard of the iſſue, many other ſinnes are no more pardoned then this: for if in the euent all other ſinnes but this ſhould be pardoned, many millions which are now in hell ſhould be ſaued. But the difference is, that other ſinnes are of that kind and condition, as through the meanes which God hath afforded to man, they may be forgiuen: but this cannot by any meanes.
                  
                  
                     §. 27. Of the reaſons why the ſinne againſt the Holie Ghoſt is vnpardonable.
                     THe reaſon why the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt neither ſhall, nor can be forgiuen, is not ſimply in regard of the greatneſſe and hainouſneſſe of it, as i
                           •
                         it were greater then the mercy of God, and ſacrifice of Chriſt; ſo as if that ſinne were put into one ballance,The generall reaſon why the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is not pardoned. Dan. 6. 15. and Gods mercy with Chriſts ſacrifice into another, that would weigh downe this: but rather in regard of that order which God hath ſet downe, and that fixed decree and doome (more immutable then the decrees and ſtatutes which the things of the Medes and Perſians confirmed) which hee hath both eſtabliſhed, and reuealed: I ſay reuealed, becauſe his ſecret decree is eſtabliſhed againſt euery impenitent ſinner, but the order is publiſhed, and the decree reuealed onely againſt ſuch as ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                     If further we would know reaſons of this reuealed decree, I anſwere, that God is not bound to render man a reaſon of his orders,Particular reaſons why the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is not pardoned. and decrees: But yet it hath pleaſed him to make knowne ſome reaſons thereof in his word, for the better ſatisfaction of mens minds, and iuſtification of his owne proceedings: as
                     
                         1 Becauſe it is impoſsible that they who ſinne againſt the Holie Ghoſt,
                        It is neuer repented of. Heb 6. 4. 6. 
                        ſhould be renewed againe vnto repentance. As no ſinne, whereof the man that commits it, repenteth not, is in the iſſue and euent pardoned; ſo this ſinne, becauſe the cōmitter thereof cannot repent, cannot be pardoned.
                     2 Becauſe they vtterly renounce,2 Means of pardon is reiected. and cleane reiect the onely meanes of pardon; which is, Chriſt Ieſus offered in the Goſpell:Heb. 10. 29. ſo as, if they be pardoned, either Chriſt muſt be offered vp againe, and crucified anew; or elſe there muſt be ſome other ſacrifice for remiſſion of ſinnes.Heb. 6. 6. &amp; 10. 26. But both thoſe are impoſſible: impoſſible it is therefore, that the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be pardoned. It falleth out with thoſe that commit this ſinne,Simile. as with a man that is deſperately and mortally ſicke of a diſeaſe, which cannot poſſibly be cured but by one meanes, and the patient vtterly refuſeth that meanes, and wil not haue it vſed; would we not ſay on that ground, that he is irrecouerably ſicke, that it is impoſſible he ſhould be cured?
                     3 Becauſe they haue wittingly ſo wholy caſt themſelues into Satans power,3 God is vtterly renounced. and vtterly renounced to haue to doe with God, as it cannot ſtand with equity, and with the honour of God to receiue them againe to mercy; they are in a manner in ſuch a caſe and eſtate as the damned in hell, concerning whom it is ſaid, that betwixt them and the Saints in Heauen there is a great gulfe fixed,
                        Luke 16. 26. ſo as there can be no paſſage from one to another. Beſides, it is probable, that as they who truly beleeue, and are in grafted into Chriſt, haue an inward teſtimony that they are Gods, and that they ſhall foreuer abide in Chriſt, and 
                           •
                        e ſaued: ſo they who ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, hauing as it were ſubſcribed to be Satans, and euer to be with him, and on his ſide, haue an inward certificate in their hearts that they are vtterly forſaken of God, and ſhall be damned: and thereupon (as the damned in hell) they blaſpheme God whom they haue renounced; yea, with all the ſpight they can they oppugne the Goſpel through an inward hatred of God the Author, of Chriſt the matter, of the Holy Ghoſt the Reuealer thereof; whom becauſe they cannot reach and come at, they perſecute the profeſſors of the Goſpell: like the old red Dragon, who, becauſe hee could not touch the woman that was cloathed with the Sunne,
                        Reuel. 12. 
                        the Moone being vnder her feete, he went to make warre with the remnant of her ſeede, which keepe the Commandements of God, and haue the teſtimony of Ieſus Chriſt.

                     HItherto of the fearefull iſſue of ſuch as ſinne againſt the Holie Ghoſt, ſet downe negatiuely, in that this ſinne ſhall neuer be forgiuen.
                     To aggrauate the terror hereof, Chriſt further ſetteth forth the iſſue of the ſame affirmatiuely, as Saint Marke hath recorded his words thus,
                     Is in danger of eternall damnation.Mar. 3. 29.

                         word tranſlated in danger, or (as others) culpable, doth not ſo much imply a likelihood that hee may be damned, as a certainty that he ſhall be damned: for it properly ſignifieth to be held faſt, as a bird when ſhee is taken in a ſnare, or a Malefactor when he is arreſted by a Sergeant, or a condemned man when hee is manicled, and fetteted againſt the day of execution. It implyeth that there is no meanes, no hope of eſcaping damnation: ſo as the maine point here intended, is this; He that ſinneth against the Holy Ghoſt, ſhall most certainly be damned. This the Apoſtle alſo implyeth, where he ſaith, that to ſuch an one there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſinnes,
                        Heb. 10. 26. 27 
                        but a certaine fearefull looking for of iudgement, and fierie indignation.

                     §. 29. Of the eternity of Damnation.
                     YEt further to aggrauate the fearefull eſtate of him that ſinneth againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it is added, that his damnation is ETERNALL. This euerlasting continuance is common to all that are caſt into hell, in which reſpect their torments is ſet forth by ſuch like phraſes as theſe,
Mar. 9. 43, 44 
                        The worme that dieth not, Fire that ſhall neuer be quenched,
                        Iude v. 6. 
                        Euerlaſting chaines,

                        Eternall fire,
                        2 Theſ. 1. 9. 
                        Euerlaſting perdition But the certainty of this euerlaſting damnation, is that which is proper to them that ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt. The doome is irreuocably paſſed againſt them; while here they liue, they know they ſhall be caſt into endleſſe, eaſeleſſe, mercileſſe, and remedileſſe torment.
                     This aggrauation of damnation by the euerlaſting continuance of it,The hereſie of the Chiliaſts refuted. doth euidently refute the hereticall poſition of Chiliaſts, or Millinaries, or (to vſe our Engliſh word) Thouſandaries, who held that the Diuels and all the damned in hell ſhould after a thouſand yeeres be deliuered. Eternall and euerlaſting continuance properly taken, as it is in the forenamed places, admitteth no date or end of time: which the forenamed heretikes obſeruing, grant that indeed the fire of hell burneth eternally; but they further ſay that it burneth after the damned are deliuered out of it: but this euaſion will not helpe them. It is certain that God maketh nothing in vaine. If there be fire burning eternally, it is for ſome end and purpoſe. But what other end or purpoſe can be imagined, then the iuſt puniſhing and tormenting of the damned in hell? Shall there be an hell, and no creature in it? Beſides, Chriſt expreſly ſaith, they ſhall goe into eternall puniſhment.
                        Mat. 25. 46. Now the fire of hell is no longer a puniſhment, then the damned be tormented therein: eternally therefore they are tormented therein, and can neuer be freed from it.
                     As for their obiections taken from Gods mercy and iuſtice, they may eaſily be anſwered, if Gods former dealing with the damned, and the nature of ſinne for which they are condemned, be duly weighed.
                  
                  
                     §. 30. Of the anſweres to the Chiliaſts obiection taken from Gods mercy.
                     COncerning Gods mercy,
                           Obiect. 1. Gods mercy is ouer all his workes. they ſay, that it is ouer all his workes, and thereupon they conclude, that the damned muſt partake thereof: which (ſay they) they cannot doe if eternally they lie tormented in hell.
                     
                        Anſw.
                        
                           Anſw. 1. Thus diuels &amp; damned haue beene made partakers of Gods mercy. Surely they haue taſted of Gods mercy: for the Diuels were made at firſt glorious Angels, Angels of light. The damned were alſo at firſt created in a moſt happy eſtate, euen after Gods image: and many of them had a long time, and faire meanes of repentance offered vnto them; beſides, the many outward temporal bleſſings which in this world they haue enioyed. They all haue abuſed and reiected Gods mercy.
                     As for their preſent eſtate,
                           Anſw. 2. Some mercy is manifeſted in hell. I might ſay that it is ſome mercy that they are not more tormented: for God could make them feele more then they doe.
                     But we are to know that Gods mercy and iuſtice muſt goe together.
                           Anſw. 3. Gods iuſtice is not ſatisfied for the damned. Where iuſtice is not ſatisfied, no place is left for mercy: but Gods iuſtice is not ſatiſfied for the Diuels and damned: how then ſhould mercy be expected?
                  
                  
                     §. 31. Of the anſweres to the Chiliaſts obiection, taken from Gods iuſtice.
                     COncerning Gods Iuſtice,
                        
                           Obiect. 2. Vniuſt to puniſh a temporary ſin eternally. they ſay that it cannot ſtand with Iuſtice to puniſh a temporary ſinne, a ſin which was committing in time, with an euerlaſting puniſhment.
                     But ſin though in continuance it were not euerlaſting,
                           Anſw. 1. Sinne infinite in nature. yet is it in nature infinite: for the greatneſſe of a ſin is meaſured according to the greatneſſe of the perſon againſt whom it is committed. Wee ſee in the counts of men that one and the ſame wrong committed againſt a meane man, and a Monarch, is accounted leſſe or greater. That which being done againſt a meane man, will ſcarce beare an action in Law (as we ſpeake) committed againſt a King may proue a capitall matter, a matter of high treaſon, and bring a man to the gallowes. Now euery ſin is a tranſgreſſion of Gods Law, and committed directly againſt the infinite Maieſtie; and in that reſpect it is infinite in nature, and deſerueth an infinite puniſhment. But the creature is finite, and cannot in time beare an infinite weight of vengeance, and therefore it lieth eternally vnder it. There is then a proportion betwixt the ſin of the damned, and their puniſhment: both are infinite. Sin in quantity and greatnes, the puniſhment in time and continuance: what ſin wanteth in continuance, it hath in greatnes; and what the puniſhment wanteth in weight, it hath in continuance. Thus the ſin and the puniſhment are correſpondent each to other, and God is iuſt in inflicting an eternall puniſhment on an infinite ſin.
                     Beſides,
                           Anſw. 2. The will of the damned to ſin is euerlaſting. though the damned be reſtrained, or cut off by the hand of God from an euerlaſting continuance to commit ſin, yet their will and deſire is neuer to ceaſe ſinning. For herein lieth a maine difference betwixt ſuch ſinners as haue their ſins forgiuen, and ſo are ſaued, and ſuch as are neuer forgiuen, but are damned. Thoſe mens minds and wils are altered, and they truly repent of their ſinnes paſt, and deſire and endeauour to ſin no more. But theſe mens minds and wils vnto their very death are ſet on ſin: and if they could alwaies liue on earth, they would alwayes ſin on earth. Now it is the mind, will, and diſpoſition of a man, whereunto God hath eſpecially reſpect.
                     Againe,
                           Anſw. 3. The damned neuer ceaſe ſinning in hel. the damned continue to ſinne euerlaſtingly in hell. As the glorious Angels and bleſſed Saints in Heauen euer continue to praiſe the God of Heauen, ſo the diuels and damned in hell continue to blaſpheme the ſame God. Their puniſhment therefore endureth no longer then their ſinne.
                     Laſtly,
                           Anſw. 4. The damned wittingly pull on themſelues eternal puniſhment. Simile.
                         they wittingly &amp; wilfully pull vpon themſelues that eternall weight of Gods wrath, and therefore iuſtly lie vnder it eternally. God hath declared before hand that eternall damnation ſhall be the reward of impenitent ſinners; and yet they impenitently continue in ſin. Suppoſe a mill-ſtone hanging by a coard, a man ſhould wilfully ſtand vnder that mil-ſtone, and cut the coard, and withall refuſe to haue any meanes to keepe the mil-ſtone from falling downe: did not he by cutting that coard pull death on himſelfe? This is the caſe of the damned. Gods wrath is an infinite burden, by Gods law it is held vp ouer mens heads: ſinne is a ſword, whereby the coard of Gods law is cut: by faith and repentance Gods wrath is ſtaid from falling on man. The vnbeleeuing and impenitent ſinner refuſeth the meanes of with-holding and ſtaying Gods wrath. Is it not now iuſt that this eternall weight of Gods wrath ſhould lie on him?
                     Thus wee ſee that it is neither againſt Gods mercy, nor againſt his iuſtice to inflict eternall damnation.
                  
                  
                     §. 32. Of the neceſsitie of being pardoned, or damned.
                     FRom the connexion of this affirmatiue part of the iudgement (ſhall be in danger of eternall damnation) with the negatiue (ſhall neuer be forgiuen) I collect that, The ſinner which hath not his pardon cannot eſcape eternall damnation: or pardon muſt be obtained, or the puniſhment muſt be vndergone.Matth. 18. 34. The ſeruant whoſe debt the Lord recalled, and would not forgiue, because of his vnmercifulneſſe, was deliuered to the tormenters.
                     Otherwiſe men would not care for Gods fauour in pardoning ſinne,Reaſon. nor any thing eſteeme Chriſts ſacrifice, whereby pardon is purchaſed.
                     
                        
                           Vſe 
                         O let vs giue no reſt to our ſoules,
 till wee haue aſſurance of the pardon of our ſins. A man attainted, and euicted of treaſon, though his life may be prolonged, and ſentence of death not executed, yet is not quiet till hee haue his pardon, vpon feare that aduantage may ſometime or other be taken againſt him for his crime: and yet the vttermoſt perill is but death of body. The perill of ſin is eternall damnation. It ſhall aſſuredly be executed, if pardon bee not gotten. How then can the ſinner, who hath no aſſurance of pardon, ſleepe quietly? Surely this doctrine is either not knowne, or not beleeued, or not regarded by ſuch as hauing no euidence of pardon, paſſe their time ouer in mirth and iollity. Well did Dauid know this point, which made him with an holy admiration ſay,
Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſsion is forgiuen,
                        Pſal. 32. 1, 2. 
                        whoſe ſinne is couered: Bleſſed is the man vnto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquitie. On the contrarie ſide wee may ſay, Curſed is hee whoſe ſinnes are not forgiuen. If eternall damnation doe make a man curſed, he is curſed.
                  
                  
                     §. 33. Of preuenting the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                     TO returne to the point in hand, wee haue heard what the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt is, and what the iſſue thereof is, namely, Impoſsibility of pardon, certaintie of eternall damnation. Whoſe heart doth not tremble to thinke of their eſtate? The very Diuels doe tremble to thinke of their owne doome and iudgement. Diues is thought to be in a moſt miſerable plight. That which miniſtreth any comfort to ſinners in this world, is, that they hope the due vengeance of their ſinnes ſhal not be executed vpon them. This hope can none haue that ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Though all ſinnes (as before we haue heard) ſhall bee pardoned, yet a man may ſo grow on in impudencie and obſtinacie, as to ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and make his ſin irremmiſſible, and himſelfe certaine of eternall damnation.
                     Let vs therefore take heed of making any way to this ſin,
                           Vſe 1. Make no way to the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt. and of prouoking God to caſt vs cleane ouer into Satans power, or rather to ſuffer vs to giue vp our ſelues wholly vnto Satan. For the preuenting hereof, let the directions heere following bee carefully obſerued.
                     1 Be watchfull againſt euery ſin,1 Withſtand beginnings. yea againſt the very beginnings of ſinne.Epheſ. 4. 27. 
                        Giue no place to the Diuell. Take heed left there be at any time in any of you an euill heart of vnbeleefe,
                        Heb. 3. 12.
                        in departing from the liuing God. Eſpecially let vs take heed of ſinning againſt our owne iudgement and knowledge, againſt the perſwaſion of our heart and conſcience, and againſt the reuelation and motion of Gods Spirit in vs. Sinne is deceitfull, and Satan is ſubtill. They allure men ſtep by ſtep to deſcend, till by degrees they bring vs into this irrecouerable downefall of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                     2 Haue the Goſpell,2 Set thy heart on the Goſpell. the Word of ſaluation, in high account. As we haue knowledge thereof, ſo let vs ſet our heart and loue vpon it. Loue of the Goſpell will make men cleaue cloſe vnto it, and will keepe them from renouncing of it.2. Theſ. 2. 10, 11. If men receiue not the loue of the truth, that they might be ſaued, God will ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould beleeue a lye, and bee damned. Through light eſteeme of the Goſpell, men oft come to reiect it: and to proue Apoſtates.
                     3 Duely weigh the difference betwixt Chriſt and the world;3 Conſides the gaine which commeth by holding Chriſt. how Chriſt can vphold thee, and preſerue, and protect and proſper thee againſt the world: but all the world cannot ſhelter thee from his warth. True knowledge of Chriſt, of the benefits wee reape by him, of the priuiledges we haue in him, of the comfort and peace we receiue through him,Phil. 3. 8. will make vs account all the things of this world, in compariſon of Chriſt, but as dung: and it will make vs alſo ſtand the more reſolutely againſt all the aſſaults of the world, and not ſuffer our ſelues thereby to be drawne from Chriſt. Let vs oft call to minde that which Chriſt hath ſaid to this purpoſe,Matth. 16. 26. 
                        What is a man profited if he gaine the whole world, and loſe his owne ſoule? or what ſhall be giue in exchange for his ſoule?
                     
                     4 If at any time through his owne weakeneſſe,4 Perſiſt not in denying the faith. or the violence of any temptation, a man be ſo farre ouertaken, as to deny the Goſpell, and to forſake Chriſt, let him not perſiſt therein;Matth. 26. 75. but rather (as Peter did) vpon the firſt occaſion offered to diſcouer his folly, let him throughly humble himſelfe, and ſpeedily repent. The longer ſinne continueth, the ſtronger it groweth: and the greater aduantage will Satan take thereby.Simile. Deadly poiſon being ſpeedily purged out, may be kept from infecting the vitall parts.
                     5 After once thou art recalled,5 Take heed of 
                              •
                           aple. hauing before time denied Chriſt, be the more watchfull ouer thy ſelfe, that thou deny him not againe,Luke

                            26. and againe. If the Diuell being once caſt out, returne againe, Hee will come with ſeuen other ſpirits more wicked then himſelfe.
                        2. Pet. 2. 20.

                            Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, they are againe intangled therin and ouercome, the latter end is worſe with them then the beginning.
                     
                     6 While thine heart is pliable pray;6 Pray againſt this ſinne. earneſtly, inſtantly pray, as againſt all ſins, ſo eſpecially againſt preſumptuous ſinnes (as Dauid did) and in particular,Pſal. 19. 13. againſt this vnpardonable ſinne.See Treat. 3. of prayer. §. 20, 22. Nothing more powerfull againſt ſinne and Satan, then faithfull prayer: without this all other meanes are fruitleſſe. This meanes is to be vſed as for our ſelues, ſo alſo for others (as we haueTreat. 3. of Prayer. §. 36. before ſhewed). There is nothing againſt which we ought more earneſtly to pray, then againſt this ſinne: for no eſtate more deſperate then theirs who fall into this ſinne.
                  
                  
                     §. 34. Of the perſons who cannot fall into the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt.
                     AS this Treatiſe was begun with declaration of Gods Mercy, in forgiuing all manner of ſins, ſo it ſhall bee concluded with application of comfort to the elect, and that in regard of the nature and iſſue of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt. That which maketh this ſin to ſeeme as an hot fiery thunderbolt, euen that which maketh it moſt terrible and dreadfull, that, I ſay, miniſtreth matter of comfort to the elect, namely, that it is impoſsible it ſhould be pardoned, and that the committers thereof are ſure to bee eternally damned.
                     
                     The comfort is this,The Elect cannot ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt. that the elect are abſolutely freed from it, ſo as they cannot fall into it.
                     The Reaſons are euident.
                     1 When they come to bee inlightned,
                           Reaſons. 1 When inlightned, they are born againe. together with their illumination, regeneration is wrought in them. Now they who are borne againe, cannot ſo wholly giue vp themſelues to ſin and Satan, as to ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. The Apoſtle (in a more inferiour degree and kinde of ſinning, then in this kinde againſt the Holy Ghoſt) ſaith, Whoſoeuer is borne of God doth not commit ſin: for his ſeed remaineth in him,
                        1. Iohn 3. 9. 
                        and he cannot ſinne becauſe he is borne againe.
                     
                     2 All the ſinnes of the elect in the iſſue and euent are
Veniall,
                        2 All their ſinnes are veniall. ſuch as ſhall be pardoned. For though in the nature and kinde of ſin, euery of their ſins are (as the ſins of all other)Rom. 6. 23. mortall (For the wages (and due deſerts) of ſin (not any one ſin excepted) is death) yet hath Chriſt by his death ſatisfied for all their ſins. All therefore ſhall be pardoned to them.
                     3 All that are elected,3 They are elected to life are elected to eternall life: and being elected thereto, they ſhall aſſuredly be made partakers thereof. Gods purpoſe and decree remaineth firme and ſtable, and cannot be made fruſtrate. They are not therefore in danger of eternall damnation: and ſo cannot fall into that ſin.
                     Yet let no man be preſumptuous, or ſecure in this regard: for firſt, hee may bee miſtaken in his election, and thinke he is choſen, when indeed he is not. If hee be deceiued, and miſtake the markes of his election, then is he not exempted from this ſinne, and the feareful iſſue thereof.
                     Againe, though he be elected, yet if hee be not watchfull ouer himſelfe, he may fall into ſo great a gulfe of ſin, and be ſo neere the pit of eternall damnation, as hee will haue cauſe againe, and againe to repent his folly, as wee haue * before ſhewed.Treat. 2. of Faith. §. 60.
