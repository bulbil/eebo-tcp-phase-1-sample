            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  THE PREFACE, VVHEREIN THE AVTOR DECLARETH HIS INTENTION IN THIS TREATISE, AND THE CAVSE why he wrote the same, and why the Apology concerning Edward Squyre being written three yeres since, was not published vntil now.
                  IT is now more then three yeres, gentle reader, since that one Edward Squyre,Edvvard Squyre executed for a fayned conspiracy, and the author of this treatyse charge therevvith. hauing bin sometyme prisoner in Spayne, and escaping thence into England, was condemned and executed for a fayned conspiracy against her Maiestyes person, wherto my self &amp; some others were charged to be priuy; &amp; for as much as it seemed to mee that this fraudulent manner of our aduersaries proceeding against Catholykes, by way of slanders and diffamations, authorised with shew of publik Iustice,The reasons that moued the author to vvryte an Apology in his ovvne defence. and continued now many yeres, did beginne to redound not only to the vndeserued disgrace, &amp; discredit of particular men wrongfully accused, but also to the dishonour of our whole cause, I thought it cōueniēt to write an Apology in my defēce, &amp; to dedicate the same to the Lords of her Maiesties priuy counsel, as wel to cleare my self to their honours of the cryme falsly imputed vnto mee, as also to discouer vnto them the treacherous dealing of such as abuse her Maiesties autority and theirs in this behalf, to the spilling of much innocent blood, with no smalle blemish to her Maiesties gouernment, and the assured exposition of the whole state, to the wrath of God, if it be not remedied in tyme.
                  This Apology being written by me in Spayne,The Apology stayd frō the print, in hope of some toleration of Catholyke religion in England. and made ready for the print (now almost 3. yeres past) it seemed good as wel to

me as to other of my friends, to stay the impression of it, vntil we should see the issue of the treaty of peace betwyxt England and Spayne then expected, with no smalle hope conceaued of many, that liberty of conscience, or at least some toleration of religion might ensue therof to the Catholikes of Englād, &amp; therfore seeing my principal intention was no other, but with the occasion of my owne purgation to seek remedy of the wrongs donne vnto vs, by discouering to the lords of the councel the vnchristian and pernicious proceeding of our cheef persecutors, it seemed to mee that yf the desyred effects of toleration, and consequently our remedy did follow of the treaty, the labour &amp; charges of printing my Apology should be needlesse.
                  
                     Hope of toleration frustrate.And although after many moneths expectation, and the meeting of the commissioners at Bullen, there appeared no lykelyhood at all, eyther of peace betwyxt the two kingdomes, or toleration of Catholyke religion in Englād (in which respect it seemed conuenient to some that my apology should be published) yet for as much, as so long tyme was then ouer past, that the matter of Squyre seemed to bee forgot, and that therfore the defence of my innocency might eyther be to litle purpose, or at least seeme out of season, I resolued to suppresse the same,Squyres matter seemed to be forgot. and the rather for that I vnderstood that howsoeuer some simple men might be deceaued in Squyres cause, yet the wysest considering the weaknes, and inualydity of the proofes, and his denial of the fact at his death, did take it for an inuention, and a stratageme of state,Squyres matter held by the vvyse for a stratagem of state. conforme to dyuers other of like quality, which many wyse men amongst the protestātes themselues haue noted heretofore.
                  
                     Squyres matter lately reuyued by 3. lybels, and much vrged against Catholyks.But now comming hether to Rome, and seing the matter reuiued and mightyly vrged to the preiudice of all Catholykes, by 2. seueral lybels composed lately in England, the one by an heretical minister ashamed of his name, and therfore Sutly shrowding it vnder a fals Visar of O. E. and the other written very lately by a puritan, as it seemeth, calling himself Thomas Diggs, I haue determined to set out my apology for the ful satisfaction of all indifferent men in this poynt;The authors determinatiō to set out his Apology. wherto I am moued the rather, for that I haue also sufficiently treated therin some other matters handled by O. E.O. E. who laboureth to proue that all the persecution which Catholykes haue hetherto suffred,In his nevv challeng to N.D. Chap 
                           •
                        
                      is iustly to be ascribed to their treasonable attēpts, besydes that he is not ashamed to

affirme, that none haue bē put to death in all her maiestyes raigne for matter of religion, which impudent assertion of his, I haue so sufficiently confuted in my sayd apology, as no more needeth to be sayd in that matter.
                  Neuertheles vpon this new occasion giuen by him, I haue thought good to prefix this treatise to thesaid Apology to giue thee good reader some more particular satisfaction concerning this point, and first to answere sincerely and truly vpon my owne knowlege an other slanderous and malitious conceit of his touching the il affection as he supposeth of diuers principal Catholykes to their country, and therefore for as much as I intend also, vpon occasions that may be offred, to debate and discusse in this treatise some pointes of Catholyke religion now in controuersy, and withal to cleare our doctrine in those pointes from certaine malitious slanders of our aduersaries, I haue thought good to entytle the whole, A defence of the Catholyke cause. Wherein I make no doubt but that thow wilt easely note (good reader) amongst many other thinges, the inconsideration of our aduersaries in that they are not content only to wrong vs in our goodes and persons, by extreme iniustice vsed towards vs, but also to wound vs so deeply in our fame by their calumniatious and slanderous lybels, and reportes, that they force vs much against our willes to lay open to the world their shameful and vnchristian proceedings, in defence of our owne innocencie, and for the honor of our cause, which not only all lawes of God nature and nations do allow and permit, but also conscience vrgeth and byndeth vs vnto in this case. For although priuate men may somtymes with great merit suffer themselues to be slaundered without contradiction, when no furder detrimēt ensueth thereof, then the losse of their owne fame or their particular hurt, yet when the same is ioyned, with other mennes harme or with a publyke damage, espetialy of religion, they cannot without offence to God neglect or omit their owne iust defence. Therefore I hope no man wil blame mee or other Catholykes in lyke case for offring iust purgation of our selues and our cause though it bee with the reproch of them that slander vs, vt obstruatur os loquentium iniqua, that the mouthes of calumniators may bee stopped.
                  And whereas the same may seeme to redound to some disgrace or dishonor of the state by reason of the publyke authority &amp; pretence of her maiesties seruice, wherewith our aduersaries do comonly

couer and colour all their malitious actions, I purpose for my parte, to vse in this my defence, such due respect to the state &amp; to the supreme gouernours thereof (I meane her Maiestie and the honorable Lordes of her counsel) that I hope to auoyd all iust cause of offence; and giue ample testimony of the loyalty of a moste dutiful subiect discouering to her Maiestie and their honors by way of humble complaint, the great abuse offred by our aduersaries, no lesse to them, then to vs, as wil more particularly appeere in my Apologie directed and dedicated to the Lordes of the councel.

                     CHAP. I.
                     AMONGST many malitious slanders, wherwith O. E. and other heretyks seek to make vs and our cause odious to all men, one of the principalest is, that wee desyre and conspyre the cōquest of our countrey by the king of Spayne, wherewith they charge not only F.

of Spayne, vntil now of late, that I retyred my selfe from thence to Rome, to satisfy my priuate deuotiō, by dedicating the rest of my declyning dayes, to the seruice of God in an ecclesiastical function.

                           science.Therfore I here protest vpon my conscience, not only in my owne behalf, but also in the behalf of F. Parsons, and the English Catholykes that serue his Catholyke Maiesty, that our dealings haue bin so contrary to that which is imputed vnto vs, that we haue donne farre better offices for our country in this poynt, then the malice of our aduersaries suffereth them to suppose. For hauing wel considered that the breach of amity betwyxt her Maiestie and the Catholike king, growing dayly by sundry acts of hostility on both parts, to an implacable quarrel, might moue him to seek the conquest of our country (wherof his puissant preparations in the yere 88. gaue no smalle suspition to the world) and not hauing any hope to be able to diswade his Maiestie from seeking some sharp reuenge of the attempts made against him by sea and land (wherto not only reason of state, but also respect of his reputation and honour seemed to oblige him) wee determined to do our vttermost endeuour so to temper and qualify the same, as it might not turne to any conquest of our country. To which purpose sir Francis Englefield,The endeuour of Syr Fran. Englefeld, F. Parsons, F Cresvvel and of the autor to diuert the Catholik king from the conquest of Engl. whylst he liued, Father Parsons, Fa. Creswel, and my self, haue at dyuers tymes represented to his Matie. of glorious memory, many important reasons to perswade him, that it was not conuenient for him to seek the conquest of England, nor probable eyther that he could conquer it, or yet if he were able to do it that he could long keep it in subiection; and this wee haue vrged so oft and with such pregnāt reasons, as wel to his Matie. that now is, as to his father of glorious memory, that I verely beleeue, that if they euer had any inclination or resolutiō to seek the conquest of England, wee haue donne sufficient diligence to diuert them from all cogitation therof.
                     
                        But whatsoeuer may be thought of their maiesties intentions in this behalf (which is not my intention here to defend nor treat of, but to signify what hath ben our treaties or dealings with them) sure I am,The Catholyk kings ansvver concerning his intention. that their Maties. haue vpō dyuers occasions assured vs, that their meaning was no other, but only to seek reparation of wrongs dōne vnto them, with the aduancement of Catholyke religion, howsoeuer the quarrel should end, eyther by extremity of warre, or composition of peace, for though the prosecutiō of the warre should proue more prosperous vnto them then wee imagined it could do, yea and that the crowne of England might therby fall to their disposition, yet they affirmed that theyr intentiō was no other, then to restore and assure Catholyke religion there,Restitution of Catholyk religion in England. by establishing a Catholyke king, with whome they might renew, and perpetually hold the ancient leagues so long continued in tymes past betwyxt the two kingdomes of England and Castile to the mutual benefit of both. And if it should so fal out that they should grow to treatyes, of peace (which was most lykely would be the conclusion of this warre,Ease of persecution by treaty of peace. sooner or later) they promised to make instance to her Maiestie eyther for liberty of cōsciēce for Catholikes, or at least for relaxsatiō of penal lawes &amp; ease of the present persecutiō.
                     Now then;The reasons vvhy the Catholyks rather expected remedy by peace then by vvarre. this being the resolution of their maiesties (as they signified vnto vs) consisting on two poynts, the one, no doubt in their owne opinions vncertayne, and in ours altogeather vnprobable, if not vnpossible (as before I haue declared) and the other, most lykely in tyme to ensew, especially considering the frequent ouertures these later yeres to a treaty of peace,Frequent ouuertures to treatyse of peace these later yeres. Impossibilites of conquest. and the continual reports of her Maiesties propension, nor only therto, but also to giue some toleration to Catholikes; any indifferent man may iudge, which of these two poynts wee were more lyke to expect and solicit, though wee should be as i

                         affected and vnnatural to our country,Her maiesties propensiō to peace, and to geue toleration to Catholyks. as our aduersaries imagine, who measuring our charity and zeale in religion, by

their owne fury, and malice against vs, persuade themselues, that because they would if they were in our case, wish and procure by all meanes possible our vtter ouerthrow &amp; ruin,The heretyks measure Catholyks by themselues. wee therfore do the lyke by them; whereas wee following the doctrine and example of out Sauiour and his saynts,The charity of Catholyks tovvards their enemies. in forgeuing our enemies, and hartely wishing the conuersion of sinners, do dayly and instantly pray to almighty God for them, that it may please him of his infinit mercy to forgiue and illuminate them.

                           es.And although we desyre nothing more in our countrey, then the extirpation of heresy and the restitution of the Catholyk fayth, yet wee wish that it may please God to woork it by such sweet meanes, that not only our monarky may stil retayne the former liberty, dignity and honour that heatherto it hath had, but also that no mannes finger may so much as ake for the same;
                     And whosoeuer doth note and regard with an indifferent eye, the proceeding of such Catholykes as haue laboured most in our cause, and especially of him whome our enemies do moste maligne,The erection of Seminaryes tendeth not to force of armes. and calumniate at this day (I meane the proceeding of father Parsons in the erection and careful mayntenance of Seminaryes) &amp; doth further consider the fruits therof, and the progresse of Catholike religion in England of late yeres, he can neither think, that the fathers intentions tend to force of armes or violence of cōquest, nor yet that our cause is in such desperat tearmes, that wee neede to vse the swoord seing the force of the woord,The svvoord needles vvhere the vvoord preuayleth. and apostolical preaching woorketh so good effect, that wee may wel hope, that heresy decaying dayly as it doth,Heresy dayly decaying. wil fall of it self within a whyle, and that in the meane tyme,The vvyse gouernours can not but note Gods handivvork, in the progresse of Catholyk religiō in England. our wyse gouernours noting the special woork &amp; hand of God therin, &amp; how litle humain policy or rigour preuayleth against true religion, wil not only moderate the rigorous cours hetherto held with Catholikes, but also willingly receaue the light of truth, for the which wee dayly pray to almighty God, &amp; dayly wil.
                     
                        This then is the conquest that wee desyre and expect in England, to wit, a conquest of soules to God,VVhat conquest the Catholyks desyre in England. with the suppression of heresy, &amp; iniquity, to the end, that the force of truth and piety may so captiuate and subdue the harts of all our countrymen, that they may be freed from the bondage of the deuil, wherin they liue, and that the Catholyke Churche and our country withall may florish, in the old manner, to the glory of God, &amp; saluation of infinit soules that dayly perish, and thus much for this poynt.
                     Now forasmuch as I vnderstād that rumours are spred abroad and a conceyt or suspition bred thereby, in the heades of many, that the english Catholykes haue also solicited the Catholyke king to the late enterprise of Ireland, I think good also to say somewhat concerning that point, that I verely think no English Catholyke was acquainted therewith otherwise thē by comō fame or opinion, seeing that neither F. Creswel nor my self (both residing at the same tyme in the courte of Spaine) nor Sir William Stanley who was also come thether vpon occasion of busynes, were made priuy thereof,Neyther F. Pars. at Rome nor any Englishman in Spayn made priuy thereto. which I ascrybe partly to the prudent manner of proceeding of those councelers,The prudent manner of proceeding of the councel of Spayn. who neuer impart any matter of impottance to any whosoeuer, except to such, as are necessarily to be employed therin; &amp; partly to the circumspection that the Irish vse in their treaties in that court,The circumspection of the Yrish. who considering that their affayres, do no way perteyn to vs, are wont not only curiously to conceale the same from vs, but also to desyre the Kings ministers not to communicate them with vs.
                     Of which smalle correspondence betwyxt vs and them in matters that concerne their country,VVitnes maye be takē of Hugh Buy agent of late. for Odonel in Spayn, and novv in her maiestyes seruice. there muay now be sufficient testimony taken of Hugh Buy, who hauing ben one of the most principal agents for Oneal &amp; Odonel in the court of Spayne, and most gratful there (as appeared by the reward giuen him at his departure thens) passed neuerthelesse shortly after his returne to Ireland to the seruice of her Maie and therfore may testify, if he be demaunded,

whether he treated with any Englishman in Spayne, or was willing wee should be trusted with his affayres, sure I am, &amp; I think he wil witnes it, that during the tyme of his negotiatiō there, which was some moneths, we neuer conferred togeather, nor so much as saluted one another.
                     And veryly for our further purgation of all suspition in this matter, I may wel say, that if we had ben as badly affected in that cause as is conceaued, and had ben consulted withall, or list to haue intruded our selues to speak our opinions, wee could neuer haue aproued the plot that was executed,Not lykly that Syr VVilliam Stanley could approue the plot that vvas executed. which any man may beleeue at least of Sr. William Stanley, as wel for the particular experience he hath of Ireland, and Irish warres, as also for his wisdome, &amp; exact skil in military discipline, and all martial affayres, wherin, as it is wel knowne, he is inferior to few men liuing, &amp; seing the occasion is offred to speak of him, I wil ad a woord or two cōcerning him,The ridiculous folly of a lybeller, in obiecting to sir VVilliam Stanley his deliuering of Deuenter to the true ovvner. &amp; his deliuering Dauēter to the Catholyke king, for that the same is opprobriously carped at in a late pamphlet of a puritan cauling himself Thomas Digges, who as it seemeth hath so litle cōscience and knowledge of a Christian mannes obligation, that he cannot distinguish betwixt trechery and discharge of duty, it beeing euident in conscience, and true diuinity, that Sir William was bound vnder payne of damnable sinne, to deliuer it to the King who was the true owner therof, &amp; from whome it was wrongfully detayned by his rebels; besydes that, his manner of doing it was such as argueth no lesse his generosity,Syr VVilliās generosity &amp; sincerity in tendring Dauenter. then his sincerytie, seeing he made no composition for money or other reward, as many others in lyke occasions haue donne, but rendred it simply without all respect of lucre and gayne, for the only discharge of his conscience, being then at liberty to serue where he would, to which purpose my Lord of Leister his general, had giuen him an ample pasport, which he hath yet to shew.

But whether it be reason that to auoyd the vncharitable conceyts of our aduersaries &amp; to satisfy their desire of our ruyn, wee suffer our selues to perish rather thē to receaue relief of the Catholyke king, I leaue it to the iudgmēt of any indifferēt &amp; vnpassionate man and so wil proceed to say somwhat in particular of F.

cases, and occasions (which now dayly occur) no terrour of temporal lawes, nor pretence of treasons may withhold vs from vsing the lyke charity towards the Priests of God; wherto our Sauiour Christ also inuiteth and incowrageth vs with promise of great reward saying he which receiueth a Prophet in the name of a prophet,

I could quoth he, do no lesse, for that they are my brethren; yea; but thow oughtst to haue hindred it, sayd the Proconsul; I could not sayd the other, for wee that be Christians, sine Dominico esse non possumus, cannot be without masse; as though, sayd the Proconcul; thou art not bound to obey the edict of the Emperours, God, sayd the martyr, is greater then the Emperours, and ought more to be obeyed, where vpon he was condemned, and executed as the rest; here now I aske our aduersaries whether these men were put to death for religion, or no, and whether it fareth not euen so with vs at this day, as then it did with them.
                     
                        For although the masse be not now made treason but a mony matter, yet by a certayne consequent,To heare masse in England is treason by consequence. it is drawen within the compasse of treason, for it cannot be celebrated without a priest; the receiuing of whome is treason, I meane a Seminary Priest, there being now so few other in England (yf ther bee any at all) that the Catholykes must eyther receiue them with daunger of their liues, or lack the necessary food of their soules, which they hold more deare then lyfe, as the old Christians also did.
                     But let vs compare breefly the proceedings of the persecutors in those tymes and these.A cōparison of the proceedings of the old persecutours, vvith those of this tyme in Engl. In the examination of those Christians the old persecutors would not content themselues with theyr confession, that they were Christians, &amp; so put them to death for their religion, but sought to bring them within the compasse of their statute; wee aske yow not, say they, whether yow bee Christians, but whether yow haue hard masse contrary to the cōmaundment of the Emperours, the lyke is donne now with vs, for it suffiseth not our persecutors that wee confesse our religion (as that wee are Catholykes) but they examine vs whether wee haue heard masse, whether we haue ben reconcyled by a Priest, or whether the Queene bee supreme head of the Churche, and such lyke, therby to draw vs within the compasse of the lawes, that they may put vs to death vnder colour of treason.
                     Furthermore the old Christians sayd for their iust defence,The ansvver of the old martyrs conform to ours novv. that they being Christians, could not be without masse, and we now say the same, &amp; that wee cannot forgo absolution of our sinnes, nor other spiritual comforts to be receiued at the hands of Priests only; to this, our persecutors reply as the others did, that it is against the lawes and statutes of her Maiesty,Act. cap. 5. we answere with the old Christiās, God is aboue all Kings, and his law aboue all lawes. Et portet magis obedire Deo quam hominibus, we must rather obey God then men; neuerthelesse we are condemned for disobedience to the lawes, as the old Christians were; and dyed

they for religion and not wee?The old martyrs vvere condemned for disobedience to the temporal lavves. as Catholyks are novv. were they martyrs and not wee? were their enemies persecuters of Gods Churche &amp; not ours? the cause is one, &amp; the self same, the proceedings lyke, no difference in the issue; breach of lawes and treason is pretended, but religion condemned, and therfore as the whole Churche hath hetherto held, and honored those old Christians for glorious martyrs,Treason pretended but religion condemned as vvel in the old martyrs as in ours novv. so doth it now at this day and euer wil esteeme these other for no lesse, as I haue shewed in my Apology more at large, and therfore I wil proceed to speak a woord or two of the great iniustice donne since my Apology was writtē, to two priests called M. Hunt, and M. Sprat, condemned, and excuted at Lincolne in the yeare 1600.
                     
                        Notable iniustice donne to M Hunt, and M. Sprat condemned at Lincolne anno 1600.These two being taken in a search and confessing themselues only to be Catholykes, were first imprisoned, and then shortly after indited for hauing conspyred, and practised the death of her Maiesty mooued her subiects to rebelion, withdrawne them from theyr natural and due obedience, and from the religion now established in England to the Roman fayth, and finally for hauing mayntayned the autority of the Pope, of all which poynts, no one touching matter of state was proued against them, no witnesse being produced, nor so much as the least presumption of any attempt or cōspiracy against her maiestyes person or state, or that rhey had persuaded any man to the Catholyk religion, ot sayd any thing in fauour of the Popes autority more then that which they answered to the captious question of the Queenes supremacy demaunded of them there, after their apprehension; lastly, it was not so much as proued that they were Priests, which though they denied not, yet they did not confesse, but put it to tryal, vrging to haue it proued by witnesses, or other sufficient arguments; whereas there was none at all but light presumtiōs therof, as that there was found in thir males, two breuiares (which many lay men vse as wel as Priests) and a few relicks and some holy oyle (which they might

haue carried for other mennes vse &amp; not their owne) so that to conclude, of all those great treasons whereof they were indited, there was no one proued, except the matter of the Queenes supremacy, which is a meere poynt of religion, as I am sure the puritans in England, and all other heretykes abroad wil witnesse with vs, who impugne the same as wel as wee; and yet neither by the verdit of the Iury nor yet by the sentēce of the Iudge, were they cleared of any one point, but condemned for all, as though they had bin guilty of all, and so in truth, executed for matter of religion, though slandred with matter of state, whereby their martyrdome was far more glorious, the malice of our aduersaries more manifest, the iniury donne vnto them vnexcusable; the sinne of the Iudges, and Iury most execrable, which sufficiently appeared by the iustice of God extended vpon Iudge Glanduile who had shewed an extraordinary malice and fury agaynst them,Iudge Glan

Watkinson, were arraigned &amp; condemned at London, for beeing made Priestes beyond the seas, and coming into England, contrary to the statute, &amp; were executed at Tiburne the 20. of April this present yeare 1602. beeing there not suffred to declare the truth of their cause and suffrance. And this was donne euen at such tyme; as hope was both giuen and conceaued of a more mylder cours of proceeding towards Catholykes; then heretofore.
                     It is moste grieuous to consider how M. Tichborne by one of his owne cote was betrayed, and apprehended: almighty God vouchsafe to restore to that wretched man so great grace as he fel from; in the dooing of that acte.
                     M. Page and M. Watkinson were apprehended in the tyme of the sessions, the one by a wicked woman; suborned

to dissemble religion for such purposes: the other by one Bomer, who hauing late before playd the dissembling hypocrite &amp; spy at Doway, returned into England there to become the disciple of his master Iudas.
                     At the same sessions was condemned for fellony, and also executed, one Iames Ducket, a Catholyke lay man, and another lay man with him, about a treatise written by a martyr diuers yeares since, concerning the cause of Catholyke sufferers.

                           inister.I Can not omit to say somewhat here of the notable impudency of a foolish minister, who being present at the death of the two martyrs at Lincolne aforenamed, and hearing one of thē declare vnto the people his innocēcy, protesting amongst other things that he dyed only for the profession of the Catholyke fayth, to the which our country was conuerted from paganisme, in the tyme of Pope Gregory the great, was not ashamed to say publykly that the religion now taught, &amp; preached there, is the same wherto England was first conuerted.
                     And although I hold not this minister for a man of that woorth that he may merit my labour or any mans els seriously to confute his ydle babling, yet for as much as the

same hath bin oft published, and preached by many others, and many ignorant abused therby, and seing the narration of our first conuersion may no lesse profit and edify the vnlearned reader, with the testimony of the truth, then content and delyte him, for the pleasure of the history, I wil breefly treat, first of the cōuersion of the Saxons or English in the tyme of King Edelbert, and after of the conuersion of the Britains in the tyme of King Lucius, &amp; euidently proue that our Catholyke faith was preached and planted in our country at both tymes, and that our Kings and country continued euer after the latter conuersion in the obedience of the Church of Rome vntil the tyme of K. Henry the eyght.
                     It appeareth by our chronicles, and histories, that in the yere of our Lord 582. (according to S. Bedes computation) S. Gregory surnamed the great, the first of that name,Beda hist.

                        uerted from paganisme, first in the tyme of the Britains, and after in the tyme of the Saxons or English, they wil say perhaps that although we proue, that the second tyme our Catholyke religion was planted and established there, when many errors (as they would haue the world to thinke) were crept into the Church, yet at the first conuersion in King Lucius dayes, their religion was taught and deliuered to the Britains, which some of their croniclers are not ashamed to intimat to their readers, and namely Holinshed who (yf my memory fayle me not, for I haue not his book here) maketh Eleutherius the Pope write a letter to King Lucius more lyke a minister of England, then a Bishop of Rome.
                     
                        Polid. lib. 2.Therefore I wil take a litle paynes to examine this poynt, &amp; wil make it manifest that our Catholyke religion which saint Augustin planted amongst the English,Platina in Eleuther Beda hist. Angl. lib. 1. cap. 4. was deliuered 400. yeres before to King Lucius and the Britains by Fugatius and Damianus, or as some say Donatianus, sent into Britany by Pope Eleutherius in the yeare of our Lord 182.
                     And although no ancient historiographer or writer (for ought I haue seene) do signify particularly, what poynts of religion were preached to King Lucius at his conuersion partly for that matters of so great antiquity are but very

breefly and obscurely handled, and partly because in those dayes (when there was no other but our Catholyke religiō vniuersally professed, &amp; this of the protestants not so much as dreamt of,) it was needlesse to signify the poynts or articles therof, for that it could not be immagined to be any other bur the Roman fayth; yet in the discourse of the tymes and ages next ensewing the conuersion of King Lucius (whyles the fayth which he receiued remayned pure, and vncorrupt) the cleare light of truth doth snfficiently shew it selfe, through the clouds of the obscure breuity wherewith the matters of those tymes are treated.
                     To this purpose it is to be vnderstood,Lib. 1. hist. eccles. ca. 17 that as our famous countryman S. Bede testifieth, the fayth preached to King Lucius and the Britains remayned in integrity and purity, vntil the tyme of the Arrians, which was for the space of almost 200. yeares, and although he signify that from that tyme forward, the people of Britany weare geuen to noueltyes, and harkened to euery new doctrine, yet it is euident in him that neyther the Arrian heresy nor yet the Pelagian afterwards, took any root there, or could infect the whole body of the Britain Church, but only troobled the peace thereof, for a short tyme, in so much, that it should seeme, the first was rooted out by the industry,Athan.

here vpon ensewed such peace and tranquility in the britan Church, that for a long tyme after (as saynt Bede testifieth) the fayth remayned there intemerata vncorrupt, wherby it appeareth that after the expulsion of the Pelagians (which was about the yeare of our Lord 450.) the Church of Britany reteyned the same fayth that it receiued at the first conuersion, and therfore yf we fynd the vse and practise of our religion vntil these tymes it may serue for a testimony that the same was deliuered to King Lucius.
                     First we read that presently after the persecution of Dioclesian wherin our protomartyr saynt Alban with some others was put to death about the yeare of our Lord 286. the Christians that had liued before in woods and caues,Cap. 7 &amp;

Alban, where many miracles were wount to be donne continually vntil the tyme of S. Bede (as he himselfe witnesseth,) &amp; afterwards, when the Pelagian heresy had somwhat infected the country, saynt German going thether out of France to confound the Pelagians,Beda Eccl. hist. lib. 1. cap. 17. at the request of the Britans themselues as I haue declared before appeased a great storme at sea, with casting therein a little water in the name of the Trinity) which no dout was holy water) and being arriued there, he restored sight vnto a noble mans daughter applying vnto her eyes certayne relyckes which he caryed about him, &amp;c. after hauing confuted the Pelagians, and reduced all to the purity of fayth, (as saynt Bede sayth,) meaning therby the fayth first preached to King Lucius he went to the toomb of S. Alban to geue thankes to God per ipsum by him (sayth saynt Bede) that is to say by his meanes or meditatiō; &amp; causing the sayd tōbe to be opened he placed very honorably therin certayne relickes of the Apostles, &amp; dyuers other martyrs, &amp; going to the place where the blood of the blessed martyr was shed he took away with him some of the dust which was stil bloody.
                     
                        Furthermore it hapned after, in the tyme that the Britans kept their lent a litle before the feast of the resurrection of our Lord, that they were molested by the Picts and Saxōs, whyles saynt German was yet there;Ibid. ca. and therefore they craued the help of his prayers, and direction, dispayring altogeather of theyr owne forces, and he vndertaking the conduct of them ordayned that when they should come to ioyne battayle all the army of the Britains should cry out a loud three tymes Alleluya, which they did, and therewith they put their enemyes to flight, and gayned a notable victory. This being donne, and the affayres of the Iland both spiritual, and temporal wel composed, saynt Bede sayth the holy Bishops had a prosperous returne, partly by their owne merits, &amp; partly by the intercession of blessed saynt Alban, whereby he geueth to vnderstand that such was their opinion according to the great deuotion they had shewed before to the blessed martyr.
                     It is also to be gathered playnly out of S. Bede that there were monasteries of Monkes and religious men in Britany before this tyme,Lib. 1. ca. for speaking of the rebellion of Constantinus against Honorius which was in the yeare of our Lord 407. he sayth that hauing proclaymed himselfe Emperour he made his sonne Constance Caesarem ex monacho, Caesar of a monk.
                     Here I wish thee to note, Good reader that saynt Bede in his breefe introduction to his Ecclesiastical history (where he intended to treat specially of the second conuersion of our country in the tyme of the Saxons) toucheth the 400. yeares before, from the tyme of King Lucius; so breefely, that he passeth with silence about 350. yeres therof at one tyme and other, noting only some things by the way, aswel concerning the temporal, as spiritual affayres, in diuers tymes &amp; ages to make some conexion of his history from the beginning.
                     Therfore I leaue it to thy consideration what testimony and euidence we should haue found of our Catholyke religion,

                     THE SAME IS CONFIRMED and proued out of Gildas. CHAP. VI.
                     THis may easely be confirmed out of Gildas the britan surnamed the sage, who wrote shortly after the Saxons came into Britany almost 200. yeares before S. Bede, in whose treatyse of the distruction of Britany, and in his reprehension of the Ecclesiastical men

of those dayes, it is euident ynough, what religion was professed from Lucius tyme vntil his, for first speaking of the persecution vnder Dioclesian, he sayth that electi sacerdotes gregis domini, the chosen Priests of our Lords flock were killed, meaning such priests as did offer sacrifice vpon the altar, for so he sufficiently interpreteth him selfe, when he reprehendeth the negligēce or the Britain Priests of his dayes, whome he calleth sacerdotes raro sacrificantes, ac raro puro corde inter altaria stantes, Priests sacrifising sildome, and seldome comming to the Altar with a pure harte,

Furthermore treating of the martirdome of S. Alban and his fellowes,Ibidem. he sayth that y
                              •
                            God had not permitted for che great sinnes of the Britains, that the barbarous nations which were entred (he meaneth the Picts and Saxons) did depriue the People of the toombs of saynt Alban, and of the other martyrs, and of the place of their martyrdomes, the same might stryk vnto them a feruor of deuotion, and deuine charity, insinuating therby the great consolation, and spiritual benefite that the Christians were wont to receiue by the visitation of those holy places; Also he sayth, that before ful 10. yeares past after that persecution,Ibidem. the Christians repayred the old Churches distroyed by the persecutors, and buylt now in honour of the martyrs, and kept festiual and holy dayes, lastly he playnly signifieth that the Christians vsed in his tyme to make vowes of chastity and that their were monasteries wherin religious and monastical life was exercysed, for he maketh mention of an holy Abot called Amphibalus,
                        Ibidem. and most

bitterly reprehendeth two wicked Princes Cuneglasus, and Maglocunus, the first for marying a widdow that had vowed perpetual chastity, and the other for that being become a monke he returned to the world and maryed, hauing a former wyfe then liuing; wherein he also geueth to vnderstād that it was not then lawful for him post monachi votum irritum after the breach of his monastical vow to returne to his owne wyfe, and much lesse to mary another.
                     
                        Ibidem.To this purpose also, it may be obserued in Gildas as before I noted in saynt Bede, that vntil the tyme of the Arrians there entred no infectiō of heresy into Britany, &amp; therfory hauing signifyed the sincerity and zeale of the Christians after saynt Albans death, in buylding Churches of martyrs, keping feastiual dayes and doing other workes of deuotion, as I declared before, he addeth, mansit haec Christi capitis membrorum consonantia suauis donec Arriana perfidia, &amp;c. this sweet consonance or agreement of the members of Christ the head remayned vntil the Arrian heresy spread her poyson there; and although he insinuat, as saynt Bede also doth, that afterwards the people became new fangled, and embraced other heresyes (meaning no dout the Pelagian heresy (which as I haue shewed before out of S. Bede was quickly extinguished there) yet afterwards he signifieth playnly that neither the Arrian, nor Pelagian nor any other heresy took root in Britany, and that the Churche was cleare therof after the cōming in of the Saxons, about the tyme of his byrth,Ibidem. which was in the yere of our Lord 594. for speaking of the tyme, and of the ouerthrow geuen by Ambrosius Aurelianus to the Saxons and Picts,Polido. verg. hist.

and ecclesiastical men did euery one their dutyes, and although he declare presently after that by the extreame negligence of their Kings and gouernours ecclesiastical and temporal, which immediatly succeded, greate corruption was entred at the same tyme that he wrote, yet it is euident ynough in him that it was not corruption of fayth but of manners, as pryd, ambition, dissolutiō of lyfe, drōkenesse, lying, periury, tyranny in the Kings, simony &amp; couetousnesse in the clergy, sildome sacrifices, breach of vowes of chastity, and of monastical lyfe, profaning of altars, and such lyke, for the which he threatneth, and as it were prophesyeth, the vtter destruction of Britany, which shortly after followed; so that amongst other things which he was persuaded brought the plague of God vpon our country, we see he taxed certayne customes peculiar to our aduersaries, and the proper fruits of their religion tending only to the ouerthrow of ours, &amp; therfore, it playnly appeareth that ours was then in vre, and receiued detriment by those who (though they were not protestants in profession) yet were protestants in humour and condition, I meane profaners of Altars and holy things, breakers of vowes, of chastity, and Apostatats from religious, and monastical lyfe; such as Luther and many of his followers haue ben since.
                     And now to come to later tymes after Gildas, yf we consider the relicks of Christian religion which saynt Augustine found in Britany, &amp; amongst other things, the great monastery of Bangor, wherein were aboue two thowsand monks, it wilbe manifest that the ancient religion of the Britains was our Catholike fayth, for although in the space of a hundreth seuenty and three yeres, that passed from the comming in of the Saxons vntil their conuersion, the Britain Church was not only much decayed, but also had receiued some aspersion of erronious and euil customes, yet in fayth and opinion they diffred not from S. Augustine,Beda hist. Angl. lib. cap. 2. insomuch that he offred to hold communion with them, if they would concurre with him in three things only, the first in

the tyme of celebrating the feast of easter, the second in the manner of administring the sacrament of Baptisme, and the third in preaching the faith to the Saxons; all which the monkes of Bangor refused, vpon no better reason, then for that S. Augustine did not ryse to them when they came to the synod, condemning him therefore to be a proud man, notwithstanding that he had restored a blynd man to sight by his prayers in the presence of all the Bishops and clergy of Britany, who vndertooke to do the lyke in confirmation of their customes, but could not performe it.
                     
                        Lib. 2 cap. 2.Therfore as saynt Bede reporteth, S. Augustine did foretel to the sayd Monkes of Bangor, that seing they would not haue peace with their brethren, they should haue warre with their enemies, and yf they would not preach vnto the English nation the way of lyfe, they should by their hands receiue reuenge of death, which after was truly fulfilled;Ibidem. for Edelfrid a pagan King of Northumberlād killed a thousand &amp; two hundred Monkes of that monastery at one tyme by the iust iudgement of God (as saynt Bede sayth) for their obstinacy.
                     Thus much for this matter, wherby thou mayst see, good reader that saynt Augustine found in wales amongst the Britains the same religion &amp; faith in substance that he then preached to the English or Saxons, and which we Catholykes stil professe, which being considered, with that which I haue proued before concerning the continual practise therof in the primatiue Church of Britany, whyles the same was in purity and integrity, no man that hath common sence, can dout that the same fayth was deliuered by Pope Eleutherius to King Lucius, and generally professed throughout Christendom at those dayes, in which respect we fynd honorable mention,Tertul. li. aduersus Iudeos, Origen. in Ezech. and testimony of the faith of the Britains, in the Fathers both Greekes, and Latins from the tyme of their conuersion, as in Tertulian in K.

                     CERTAINE POINTS OF CONTROUERSY are discussed, wherby it is prooued that King Lucius receiued our Catholyke fayth, and first of the Popes supremacy in Ecclesiastical causes. CHAP. VII.
                     BVT to the end that this vndouted truth may be cleared of all dout, I wil ioyne Issue with our aduersaries, vpon some two or three poynts now in controuersy betwyxt vs, and them, and breefly proue, that the doctrin that we teach concerning the same, was publykly held for truth throughout Christendome in King Lucius dayes, and that therfore he could receiue no other then the same from the Church of Rome, and this I vndertake the more willingly, for that albeit all matters of controuersy haue ben very learnedly and sufficiently handled, yea and whole volumes written of them, by our English Catholykes in the beginning of her maiestyes raygne, yet by reason of the strayt prohibition of the sayd bookes, there are an infinit number in England, especially of the younger sort, that neuer saw the same, to whome I desyre to giue in this treatyse at least some litle tast, of the truth of our Catholyke religion, so farre as my determined breuity wil permit.
                     
                        First who can with any reason deny that the Popes supremacy (the confession whereof is now made treason in England) was in King Lucius dayes acknowledged generally of all men? for what moued him being so farre from Rome, to seeke to receiue the faith of Christ from thence but that he desyred to haue it from the fountayne &amp; head? were there not Christians at the same tyme in England, as there had ben from the tyme of Ioseph of Arimathia, by some of whome it is lyke he was conuerted,

                     Thus farre S.

The second that the continual succession of the Bishops of Rome in one seat and doctrin is an infalible argument of the truth.Tertul. lib prescrip.

Irenaeus that they remayne confounded, and that they are to be registred in the number of those that eyther by an ouerweening of their owne wits, or by vayne glory,

                     The third poynt, that I wish to be noted in the words of S. Irenaeus, is the supreme dignity of the Roman Churche aboue all other, seing that he cauleth it the greatest &amp; most ancient (not in respect of tyme, for the Churches of Hierusalem and Antioch were before it) but for autority and therfor vrgeth it as a matter of necessity, &amp; duty,

Peter the Apostle, not only for him selfe but also for his successors, which.

                     THAT OVR SAVIOVR made S. Peter supreme head of his Churche. CHAP. VIII.
                     THE supreme autority of S. Peter ouer the Churche of God, is to be proued directly out of the holy scriptures, by many places, and arguments, but 3. shal suffice for breuityes sake.
                     The first place is in S. Mathew where our sauiour promised to S. Peter to buyld his Church vpon him,Math. 16. saying Tu es Petrus &amp; super hanc Petram adificabo Ecclesiam meam, that is to say thou art Peter, or a rock, and vpon this rock I wil buyld my Churche, signifying by this allegory that he made him the foundation or head of his Church; for the head is to the body, &amp; the gouernour to the common welth, as the foundation is to the buylding, that is to say the principal part, the stay, strength and assurance therof; and this appeareth more playnly in the Siriac tongue in which saynt Mathew wrote his gospel, where there is no difference betwyxt Petrus &amp; Petra, Peter and a rook. For in steede of thou art Peter, &amp;c. the Siriac hath, thow art a rock, and vpon this rock I wil buyld my Churche.
                     For this cause (as Ciril lib. cap. 2. loan. S. Ciril, S. Chrisost. i cap. 16. mat. Chrisostome, S.Hilar. in c 16. mat. leo. epist. 89. ad epistolos. Hilary and others do note) the name of S. Peter being first Simon was changed by our Sauiour who sayd vnto him tu vocaberis cepha

                           , thou shalt bee called Cephas, which the Euangelist expoundeth saying, quod interpretatur 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            that is to say a rock, signifieng aptly by the very word it selfe, that he would buyld his Churche vpon him as vpon a most sure rock and stone, whereto S.

Hilary agreeth expounding the same woords and speaking to S. Peter thus O happy foundation, of the Churche by imposition, of thy new name, in this respect S. Peter is called in the greeke text sometymes 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                        Math. 16.Therfore I cannot omit to discouer vnto thee here (good reader) a suttle shift of our aduersaries in translating those words of our sauiour, Tu es Petrus &amp; super banc Petram, for although they censure, and controle, all the translations that the Catholyke Church vseth, and professe to translate the scriptures immediatly out of the hebrew, yet in translating this place, they follow the latin, because the hebrew is far more cleare against them in this controuersy for the better vnderstanding whereof, it is to be considered that all the ambiguity &amp; dout therin ryseth of the difference that may be noted in the greeke, Latin and English translations, not only of them all from the Siriac or Hebrew, but also of one from another; for that euery translator obseruing the dialect or propriety of his owne tongue, hath some variety from the rest, and the English most of all; for although in the greeke &amp; Latin &amp; all other languages deriued of them, the name of Peter and a rock or stone is eyther all one (as 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         in the greeke) or els haue great affinity and a manifest allusion the one to the other, (as in Latin Petrus and Petra, in Italian Pietro &amp; Pietra in the Spanish Pedro and Piedra, in the portugues Pedro &amp; Pedra, and in the french, Pierre for both, (though ther be difference in the gender) yet in our English tongue, Peter neither signifieth a rock nor a stone, neyther yet hath any alusion, nor affinity therwith, in which respect our English translation much lesse expresseth the force and true sence of our sauiours words in the hebrew, then eyther the greeke or the Latin; of both which I will treate a litle for the better explication of this question, and first of the greeke.
                     Albeit 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         in greek is more commonly vsed for a rock

                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         yet because 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         is of the masculine gender, &amp; hath also the same signification, yt seemed more fit to be applyed to the name of a man then 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , whervpon yt followed that when not only saynt Peter was commonly cauled 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         of the greekes, (to expresse therby in their language the Syriac woord Cephas) but also many others had takē vnto them that name for the honour they bore to S. Peter, the word 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         came to haue two significations, the one a rock or stone, and the other the name of a man which wee cal Peter, and therfore he that translated S. Mathewes gospel into the greeke out of the Siriac or hebrew, vsed both the words 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         &amp; 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         in translating, thow art a rock and vpon this rok I wil buyld my Church; for in the first place he hath 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , and in the second 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         to denote in the first, as wel the trew significatiō of Cephas, that is to say a rock, as also the name by the which S. Peter was best knowen to the greekes, and to expresse in the later the allegory of a rock, according to the very words of our sauiour, lest perhaps otherwyse the readers attending more to the name, th
                           •
                        n to the signification therof, should not perceiue the force of our sauiours allegory, who to signify the strength and stabilitie of his Churche gaue the name of a rock to saynt Peter, vpon whome he meant to buyld the same, and therfore, I say, the greeke translator elegantly vseth both 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         and 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , explicating the first by the later, and expressing the allegory in both.
                     And as for the Latin translation it is manifest that it followeth the greek, and not the hebrew, nor Siriac, and that therfore, for 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         it hath Petrus, partly for the allusion that Petrus hath both to 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         in greeke &amp; also to Petra in Latin (both which signify a rock) and partly for that, from the tyme that saynt Peter was knowne by the name of 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         to the Romans, Petrus (which is deriued of 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , by turning os into vs, to make it a Latin word) was no lesse vsed for his name and other mens amōgst them then 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         amongst the greekes. And although now in common vse Petrus doth

signify nothing els but Peter, in which respect it may seeme that the Latyn translator rather expresseth the bare name of a mā, then the true sence or signification of 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         or Cephas neuerthelesse the circumstances being considered, yt is euident that Petrus or Peter in the scripture, doth not only signify the name of a man, but also a rock.
                     To which purpose there is to be noted a great difference in Petrus, when it is spoken of the Apostle S. Peter, &amp; when it is spoken of any other man; as for example, Cook is a name now common to many of good cauling, though perhaps at first it grew to be a name, from some one that by reason of his office was commonly cauled Cook, and therfore though now in such as haue no such office, yt signifieth nothing but a bare name, yet in him that was first cauled so, it signified rather his office then his name; and in lyke māner, though Petrus now haue no other signification but the proper name of a man, as Thomas or Iohn and the lyke, yet in S. Peter the Apostle, who was the first that was cauled so, it signified the office and quality, which Christ gaue him when he made him a rock to buyld his Church vpon, and cauled him Cephas to signify the same; the which word Cephas is interpreted Petrus, in our Latin translation and Peter in English for where as the Euangelist himselfe expoundeth Cephas by the word 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         in greeke saying,Ioan. 1. 
                        quod interpretatur Petús that is to say which is interpreted a rock the Latin translator saith, quod interpretatur Petrus which is interpreted Peter meaning therby also a rock, or a man that metaphorically was a rock,Matth. 16. for other wyse he geueth not the true sence of Cephas, nor of 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        .
                     Agayne in this sentence tu es Petrus &amp; super hanc Petram, thow art Peter and vpon this rock, &amp;c. these words super hanc Petram do playnly expound Petrus to signify a rock; for that the pronoun this can not haue so proper relation to any other word, as to the next antecedent, which is Petrus, so that the sence must needs be thus,Math. 16. 
                        thou art a rock, and vpon this rock I wil buyld my Church.
                     
                     
                        Here also may be considered the correspondence that the words of our sauiour to S. Peter, haue with S. Peters words to him, for when our sauiour asked his Apostles, quem me esse dicitis, who say you that I am, he asked not what they called his name, but what they sayd was his quality, &amp; dignity; and therfore saynt Peter answered not, thou art Iesus, (which was the name that was geuen him at his circumsision) but, thou art Messias, that is to say, the anoynted, or as we commonly say, Christ, the sonne of the liuing God; which our sauiour recompensed; not by telling him his name, which was Simon, but by giuing him another name, and such a one as signified the office, qualitie and dignitie that he bestowed vpon him; and therfore he sayd vnto him, thou art Cephas, or Petrus, that is to say, a rock or Peter, and vpon this rock I wil buyld my Churche, which saynt Leo, expresly noteth saying in the person of Christ to S. Peter thus,Leo Serm. in anniuer pontificat

                        as my father hath made knowen vnto thee my diuinity euen so I make knowne to thee thy excellency, that thou art Peter that is to say a rock, &amp;c. and S. Hierome expounding the same words of our sauiour and speaking also in his person, sayth thus,Hieron. in cap. 16. Matth. 
                        because thow Symon hast sayd to mee thou art Christ the sonne of God, I also say to thee, not with a vayne or Idle speeche, that hath no operation or effect, but quia meum dixisse fecisse est, because my saying is a doing, or a making, therfore I say vnto thee thow art Peter (or a rock) and vpon this rock I wil buyld my Churche, thus farre S. Hierom, signifieng that Christ both made him a rock, and cauled him a rock; which yet he declareth more playnly in that which he addeth immediatly, as Christ, sayth he, being himselfe the light granted to his disciples that they should be cauled the light of the world, ita Simoni qui credebat in Pertam Christum, petri largitus est nomen, so to Simon who beleued in Christ the rock, he gaue the name of a rock (for yf we expound not Petri, so, the similitude is to no purpose and therfore it followeth immediatly,) and according to the metaphor of a rock it is truly sayd to him, I wil buyld my Churche vpon thee here yow see S. Hierome vnderstandeth Petrum &amp; Petram that is to say

                        Peter &amp; a rock to be all one; and so doth S. Ambrose expounding tu es Petrus,

                        thow art Peter; he is cauled (saith he) a rock, because he first layd the foundation of fayth amongst the gentils, and lyke an vnmoueable stone, doth hold vp or susteyn the frame and weight of the whole Christian woork.

Peter, and especially in those words of our sauiour, Tu es Petrus, doth signify a rock, no lesse then

                     Yet I think no man can be so simple as to ymagin that these Fathers affirming the Church to be buylt vpon S. Peter,Theophil in cap. 22. Luc. Ambros. Serm 47. denied our sauiour Christ to be the first, &amp; principal foundation therof; of whome the blessed Apostle worthely sayth,Aug. in Psal. contra par. donati Maxi. Serm. 1. 
                        that no man can lay any other foundation, then that which is layed already; Iesus Christ; which place, our aduersaries are wont to obiect against this our Catholyk doctrin; whereas they may learne not only in the Fathers,Concil. Chalced. but also in the scriptures themselues that there are dyuers foundations of the Churche,1. Cor. 3. though some be more principal then other, &amp; our sauiour Christ the first and cheefe ground-work of the whole buylding; as also in a Kingdome, or common welth, there are diuers heads, though subordinate one to an other, &amp; all subiect to one head, all which may be called foundations in the polityke buylding, because the same leaneth and resteth vpon them, and is sustayned by them, though not by all alyke or in equal degree. To this purpose wee read in the Apocalipse that the walles of the citty,
                        Apo. ca. 22. that is to say the Church, are sayd to haue twelue foundations, &amp; in them the names of the 12. Apostles of the lambe;2. Ephes. 19. and agayne in saynt Paule to the Ephesians, you are, sayth he, Citizens of saynts, &amp; domesticals of God, buylt vpon the foūdations of the Apostles, and Prophets.
                     
                     
                        Aug. in Psal. 16.Therfore S. Augustyn sayth that our sauiour may as wel be cauled fundamentum, fundamentorum, the foundatiō of foundations, a Pastor Pastorū, &amp; Sanstus Sanctorū, the shepherd of sheperds, or holly of hollies; the reason wherof S. Basil geueth notably for the explication of this matter. Though Peter, sayth he, be a rock, yet he is not a rock as Christ is, for Christ is the true vnmouable rock of himselfe, Peter is vnmouable by Christ the

rock, for Iesus doth communicat &amp; imparte his dignityes,Basili. ho. d Paenit. not depriuing himselfe of them, but retaining them himselfe, &amp; yet bestowing them vpon others; he is the light, &amp; yet he sayth you are the light he is the Priest &amp; yet he maketh Priests, he is the rock, and made a rock, thus far saynt Basil.Leo Serm in anniuet pontifican sui. The same teacheth S. Leo very elegantly explicating the words of our sauiour. Tu es Petrus, and speaking in our sauiours person thus. Thow art Peter, that is to say, although I am the inuiolable rock, the corner stone which vniteth both syds of the buylding, &amp; the foundation, besyds the which no mā can lay any other, yet thow art also a rock, because thow art consolidat &amp; hardened by my strength, to the end that those things which ar proper vnto me by my owne power, may be to the cōmon with mee by participation.
                     
                     Hereby it appeareth that although our sauiour Christ be the cheefe and principal foundation, that is to say the head of his churche, yet by buylding the same vpon S. Peter, he made him also the foundation or head therof, next after himselfe, and as there are dyuers other heads vnder S. Peter, who in respect of theyr subiects may be truly cauled, &amp; are heads, and yet in respect of S. Peter are subiects, euen so, S. Peter, in respect of all the whole church, may properly be cauled, and truly is the head therof, though he be subordinat &amp; subiect to Christ, as all the rest are both to Christ and him; and therfore S. Leo in the place aforesayd, sayth that there ar in the people of God many priests, and many Pastors,

                     The second place wherevpon I ground the supremacy of S. Peter, is the words of our sauiour following the former in S. Mathew videlicet.Matth. 1. 
                        I wil geeue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt bynd vpon earth, it shalbe bound also in heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose vpon earth, it shalbe loosed also in heauen; By the keyes is signified

preheminent power, and authority, wherevpon grew the commō custume of deliuering to princes the keyes of townes, and fortresses, when the people therin yeild, and submit themselues to their absolute wil, &amp; power; and in the scriptures, the woord clauis that is to say, a key is often vsed in the same sence; as in the Apocalipse, to signify the preheminent authority of our sauiour it is sayd of him,

Peter, to which purpose it is to be noted, that albeit our sauiour gaue to all his Apostles, authority to remit and retayne sinnes, yet he made no mention of geuing the keyes to any but to S.

were geuen to S.

Peter as head of the Apostles, and consequently as head of the Church, they were geuen also to the Apostles, and to the whole Church, for what is geuen to the king as king, the same is geuen to the common wealth, and from him or by him, as head therof, is communicated, &amp; imparted to the whole body.

                     The third, and last shalbe, the commission and charge that our sauiour gaue particularly to S. Peter to feed his sheep, wherby he made him general Pastor ouer his whole flock, whereof Eusebius Emissenus sayth thus,Euse. Emissi hom. de natiuit. Ioann

                        first Christ comitted vnto him his lambs, &amp; then his sheepe, because he made him not only a pastor or shepherd, but also the pastor of Pastors; Therefore Peter feedeth the lambes, &amp; he feedeth the sheepe, he feedeth the young ones, &amp; their dammes, he gouerneth the subiects, &amp; their prelats, so that he is Pastor of all; for besydes lambes &amp; sheepe there is nothing in the Church.
                     
                     This is more euident in the Greeke wherein the gospel of S. Ihon was written, then in our latin translation, for where as we haue 3. tymes pasce that is to say feed, the greeke hath in the second place 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

Peter commission, not only to feed his flock with preaching and teaching, but also to exercyse all pastoral authority ouer them, that is to say to rule and gouern them, in which sence the

Greeke word

                        he shal rule them in an yron rod, and againe in the Psalm,Psalm. 2.

Peter pascendas, id est docendas regendasque, to be fed, that is to say to be taught and gouerned;Theophil in ca. 21. Ioan. Theophilactus also vpō the same place witnesseth that Christ gaue to S. Peter praesecturam ouium totius mundi, the gouernment of the sheepe of the whole world;Chrisost. lib.

Peter to be endewed with authority, and farre to excel the other Apostles, and agayne expounding the same words otherwhere, he sayth that Christ spake vnto him only,Hom. 8.7. in Ioan. because he was the mouth &amp; head of the Apostles, and committed vnto him curam fratrum suorum, the charge of his brethren, and a litle after;Hom. 1. de paenit. that Christ gaue him the charge of the whole world, which he also affirmeth in an other place of the vniuersal Churche, saying, that the supremacy and gouernment of the Churche throughout the whole world was geuen him by Christ.

Lucius) cauleth the Roman Church Cathedrā Petri, ecclesiam principalē, vnde vnuas sacerdotaelis exorta est, the chayre of Peeter, the principal or cheef Churche from whence springeth all Priestly vnity, signifieng therby that as the vnity of the natural body consisteth in that dyuers members being combyned vnder one head, do all receiue from the same the influence of one lyfe, so also the vnity of the mistical body of Christ consisteth, in that diuers Churches being conioyned, vnder one head, which is the Roman Churche, or chayre of Peter, do all receiue from the same the influence of one spirit and doctrin which he declareth playnly in his book of the vnity of the Churche, where he sayth, euē as there are many beames of the Sunne, and one light, many bowes of one tree, and yet one strength founded in one root &amp; many brookes flowing from one fountayne, &amp; a vnity therof conserued in the spring, euen so the Churche of our Lord, casting foorth her light euery where stretcheth her beames, through out the world &amp; yet the light is one, shee extends her bowes ouer the whole earth, &amp; spreads her flowing riuers farre &amp; neare, and yet there is one head, one beginning, and one fruitful, and plentiful mother. Thus far this famous martyr who speaking also other where of Peters chayre, declareth the miserable state of those that are deuided &amp; seperated from the same, which I wish our aduersaryes diligently to note, there is sayth he one God, one Christ, one Churche, one chayre founded vpon Peeter by our

Lords woords, an other Altar cānot be erected nor a new priesthood ordayned whosoeuer gathereth any where els scattreth &amp; it is counterfeyt, wicked, and sacrilegious, whatsoeuer humain fury doth institute, &amp; ordayne to violate the ordenance of God,

                     To returne therfore to S.

                     THAT THE BISHOPS OF Rome exercysed supreme authoritie and iurisdiction in the tyme of king Lucius. CHAP. X.
                     NOW then let vs consider how the byshops of Rome did exercyse this theyr authority before, and in the tyme of K. Lucius, and neare vnto the same, the which may appeare partly by the appellatiōs out of all parts to the sea Apostolyke, and the restitution, or deposition of bishops by the sayd sea, and partly by the decrees made by the same for the whole Churche, and the censures layd vpon such as would not receiue and obey them.
                     Wee read in Tertulian (who liued in king Lucius tyme) that Montanus Prisca and Maximilla fals prophets in Phrigia,Epiph. haer

                        tanus, and geuen peace to the churches of Asia, lo then how great was the authoritie of the bishops of Rome in forayn &amp; remote parts, by the testimony of Tertulian who was then an heretyke and a great enemy to the Roman Churche.
                     S. Cyprian about 250. yeares after Christ testifyeth that Fortunatus,Cipr. lib. 1. epist. 3. and Felix being deposed in Afrike by him; appealed to Pope Cornelius, and that Basilides in lyke manner,Cipr. lib.

                           . epistol. 4. being deposed in Spayne appealed to Pope Steuen who suceeded Cornelius, and although S. Cyprian shew that Basilides being iustly condemned did vniustly appeale and

deceiue the Pope by fals suggestion &amp; that therfore his appellation could not auayle him, yet he confesseth that the Pope receiued the appellation, wherein he sayth he was not to be blamed, but Basilides for deceauing him, so that wee see the custome of appealing to the bishop of Rome out of al partes, is most ancient, whereof I wil also alleadge some other examples of later tymes, though aboue 1000. yeres agoe.

Archiepiscopus Leo. The most holy Archbishop Leo,Greg. lib. 2. cap. 6. restored to him his bishoprik. And S.

                     Now to speak a word or two of the deposition of Byshops wee fynd an euident example therof, within 40. or 50. yeares after the cōuersion of K. Lucius, for S. Cyprian wrote to Steuen the Pope to desyre him to excomunicat &amp; depose Marcian the Bishop of Arles in France, and to substitute an other in his place by vertue of his letters to the people there,Cypri lib 3. epist. 13. &amp; further desyred him to aduertyse him who should succede him, that he &amp; the Bishops of Africk might know to whome to direct their letters, so that wee see the authority and custome in the Church of Rome to depose forraine Bishops, is no new thing, nor a iurisdiction vsurped in later tymes by fauour of Christian Emperours, seing in the great persecutions in the primitiue Churche, when none were more persecuted by the Emperours, then the Popes them selues, (who vntil this tyme were almost all martired) they exercysed this authority, as their successors haue done euer since, indifferētly without exception vpon all Bishops whosoeuer, yea vpon the 4. principal patriarkes of Constantinople Alexandria, Antioch, and Hierusalem, in so much that Nicolaus the first Pope of that name writing to Michael Emperour of Constantinople about a 1000.Nicol. epist. ad Michael. yeres ago reckoneth 8. Patriarchs of that Churche deposed by Bishops of Rome before his tyme,Theodoretus lib 5. hist. cap. 23. and Flauianus Patriarch of Antioch was deposed by Pope Damasus 1200. yeares ago and although the Emperour Theodosius labored to restore him yet he commaunded him to go to Rome to answere for him selfe, and both S. Chrysostome Bishop of Constantinople,Socrat. lib. 5. hist. cap. 15.

                     But to the end good reader thou mayst the better vnderstand how this matter passed, and euidently see the supreme autoritie of the Bishops of Rome in those dayes, it is to be considered; that there hauing been from the tyme of the Apostles a different manner of keeping Easter in the Churche of Rome, and the Churches of the lesser Asia (the Romans keeping it alwayes vpon the sunday, according

to the tradition of the Apostles, S. Peter, and saynt Paule; &amp; they of Asia obseruing the tyme and custome of the Iewes, pretending the example and tradition of S. Iohn the Euangelist) Pius the first of that name, Bishop of Rome, desyring to reduce all the Churche to vniformity, made a decree that the feast of Easter should be celebrated only vpō sunday, but for that the Churches of Asia made great dificulty to leaue their tradition, as wel Pius, as Anicetus, Soter, and Eleutherius forbore,Euseb lib. 5 cap. 24. (for peace and quietnesse sake) to compel them by Ecclesiastical censures to the obseruation therof; but afterwards Victor who succeeded Eleutherius, noting that not only those which inclyned to keep the ceremonies of the old law, were much confirmed therby in their opinion, but also some in Rome namely one Blastus sought to introduce that custome there,Tertul de praescrip. ca

Therfore perceptae qutoritate, the authority or commaundement being receiued, Theophilus assembled Bishops not only out of his owne prouince but also out of diuers other cuntryes, and when they were come togeather in great numbers. Theophilus, protulit autoritatem ad se missam Papae Victoris, Theophilus shewed the autority or commaundment that Pope Victor had sent him, &amp; declared quid sibi operis fuisset iniunctum, what was enioyned him to do, &amp;c. herein by the way I wish to be noted how the Bishop of Rome in those dayes (that is to say in the tyme of Lucius) exercised his autority in calling of councels, both of the Byshops of the Latin or west Church, &amp; also of the east, seing Theophilus Byshop of Palaestina assembled the prelats not only of his

owne prouince, but also of diuers other by vertue of the commission geuen him by Pope Victor.

Thus wee see this great controuersy ended also in England neere a thousand yeres agoe, by the autority of the sea Apostolyke, so that to returne to Pope Victor, wee may truly say he had the victory, or rather that saynt

Peeter by him, and his successors vanquished all such as opposed themselues to this traditiō of the Roman Churche.
                     Seing then in the tyme of K. Lucius, the Bishops of Rome both claymed and exercised supreme authority ouer all other Bishops, making general edicts, condemning heretykes, deposing and restoring Bishops, cauling counsels, and excommunicating whole prouinces and countryes, I appeale to thee gentle reader, whether he was not then generally held for supreme head of the Church, &amp; whether it is lykly, that when Eleutherius the Pope made King Lucius a Christian, he made him a protestāt, that is to say, an enemy to the sea Apostolyk, a persecuter of Priests, and of all such as defend the dignity, and autoritie, of saynt Peeter his predecessor, from whome he claymed, and held the supremacy, of the Churche, which now all protestants deny to his successors.
                     And agayne, seeing I haue proued that the authority of the sea Apostolyke is not grounded vpon any humain tradition but vpon the institution of our sauiour himselfe, who left his flock and sheep to saynt Peeter to be fed, and buylt his Churche vpon him,Ioan. 21. as vpon a sure rock, promising that hel gates should not preuayle against it,Matth. 16. ordayning for the auoyding of Schisme &amp; diuision one head, from the which the dyuers and manyfold members of his Churche might receiue the influence of one doctrin and spirit, what shal wee say of them, that are not of this fold, that do not communicat with this head, that are not planted vpō this root of vnity, nor buylt vpon this rock; that agaynst the chayre of Peeter set vp a chayre of pestilēce, can they be the sheep of Christ, or members of his mistical body? or receiue the influence of his spirit? it is no maruel, yf they be caryed away with euery blast of new doctrin, torne and rent with euery schisme, and cast at length vpon the rockes of heresy or atheisme; haue wee not then sufficient reason to giue lands, lyues, or what honour, pleasure, or comodity soeuer the world yeildeth, rather then to be driuen from

this safe harbor of truth, and ancor of vnity, into the seas of schisme and heresy, to the assured shipwrack of our soules? and when wee spend our blood for this cause, do we not dy for religion, yea for a most important point of religion, though it be made treason? wherof wee may truly saye with the blessed martyr Sir Thomas More thet it is a treason without sinne, for the which a mā may be hanged and haue no harme, dy and liue for euer, seeme to some a traytor; and be a glorious martyr.

                        a woorshipper of Images, as though there were no other Idolatry, but that which may be dōne to Images, or that Image and Idole were all one, or that it could be sayd with any propriety, or reason, that a couetous man makes his money an Image, as it may be properly sayd, that he makes it an Idol, because he makes yt his God, which yt neither is, nor can be, in which respect it may wel be cauled an Idol.
                     Furdermore they bewray in themselues either great simplicity or peruers malice, in that they permit no honour nor reuerence to be donne to the Image of Christ, &amp; his saynts; for doth not reason and common experience teach vs that the honour or reuerence donne to the Image passeth from thence to the Prototipon,

                         (as I haue noted in my Apology vpon an other occasion) whervpon S. Gregory Nazianzen sayth, that the simple Christians who did not fal into account of the deceat,

were to be excused of ignorance, for that they thought they adored no more but the Emperours image; if therfore it be lawful to adore the image of an Emperour or earthly king for that he is the image of almighty God, I meane, if it bee lawful to adore the image of Gods image, how much more is it lawful to do reuerence to the image of God him selfe, I meane of Christ God and man?
                     And sure I am that many in England which wil not haue, nor reuerence; the image of our sauiour for feare of committing idolatry, wil make no bones at all, to keep some picture or remembrance of their Maistres to kisse it, and to vse other tokens of affection and respect towards it, to shew therby their good wil to her.
                     And how many are there in England that condemne catholykes for keeping images and pictures to moue them to deuotion, and yet make no scruple to keep lasciuious pictures to prouoke themselues to lust? wherby they might see by their owne experience, if they were not wilfully blynd, what is the effect of good and deuout pictures in wel disposed mynds, and what it would bee in themselues if they were as spiritual, and feruerous in the loue of God, as they are carnal and fyry in sensual appetyt; for who douteth that deuout representatiōs do as easely moue pious and godly minds to holy cogitations, and affections, as lasciuious obiects do kindle carnal mynds to concupiscence and lust? and therfore S. Gregory Nissen sayth,Greg. Niss. in orat de deitate filij &amp; spiritus Sācti. allega. in concil. that he neuer beheld the picture of Abraham sacrifising his sonne Isaac, but hee was moued to teares, and yet it is likely that he had often read the story therof, without any such effect, as Basilius byshop of Ancyra noted very wel in the 7. general councel of Nice,Cōcil. Nicen. 2. when the same was aleaged there out of S. Gregory aboue 800. yeres agoe, wherevpō Theodorus byshop of Catane also inferred,Ibidem. in the same councel, that much more may the story of our sauiours passion represented by picture woorke the lyke effect in deuout persons that behold the same. Wherof I think

good to declare here a manifest example of my owne knowledge.
                     It chāced in the house of a Catholyke where. I was, that a young mayd of 15. or 16. yeres of age, (who had ben alwayes brought vp amongsts protestātes) comming thether, and seeing a picture of Christ crusified demaunded whose picture it was, and being told that it was the picture of our sauiour Christ, wherby she might see what he suffred for vs, she was moued with such compassion that after she had stedfastly beheld it a whyle, she burst out first into sighes, &amp; after into teares, saying that shee had often heard of it, but neuer seene it before, adding further our Lord helpe vs if he suffred all this for vs.

Furthermore in his book against the gentils, where he discourseth at large of the lyfe &amp; death of S.

                     THAT OVR DOCTRIN concerning the sacrifice of the Masse was generally receiued, and beleued, in the tyme of king Lucius, &amp; first that it was foretold &amp; prophecyed by Malachias. CHAP. XIIII.
                     BVT I wil passe to an other importāt poynt, I mean the sacrifice of the Masse, to see whether our doctrin concerning the same or theirs was deliuered by our sauiour to the Apostles and taught in king Lucius tyme or no.
                     The sacrifice of the Masse consisting in the oblation of the blessed body and blood of our sauiour Iesus Christ, was prophesyed by Malachias, praefigured by the sacrifice of Melchifedeth, instituted and offred by our sauiour at his last supper, deliuered by him to his Apostles, practysed by them and by the Churche of God euer since.
                     
                        Malach. 1.Malachias the Prophet foretelling the reiection of the Iewes, and the election of the gentils, signifieth withall the translation of the Iewes law and priesthood into a new law, and a new priesthood, and compareth or rather opposeth the priests of the one, to the priests of the other,

sacrifice to sacrifice, place to place, altar to altar, and a poluted bread which they were wōt to offer only in Hierusalem, to a cleane oblatiō which should be offred to God amongst the Gentils euery where throughout the whole world, saying to the priests of the Iewes in the person of God, that seing they dispysed his name, and offred vpon his altars a polluted bread, and blynd and lame sacrifices, non est mihi voluntas in vobis, &amp;c. sayth hee,Malach c

Thus farre the Prophet, who cannot be vnderstood to speake of any other sacrifice then of the Masse, which being nothing els but the oblation of the blessed body and blood of our sauiour Iesus Christ in forme of bread and wyne, is a most pure and cleane oblation, and cannot be polluted by the wickednes of the priests, as the bread offred in the old law was wont to be; to which purpose it may be noted that the Prophet speaking of dyuers kinds of sacrifices, some consisting of beasts or catel (which he signifyed by the words blynd and lame) and other in bread, he attributeth the word polluted or defiled to the bread only, not without mistery, to oppose therto the cleane sacrifice of the gentils in forme of bread, cauling it a cleane oblation, and putting the special force of the antithesis betwyxt the figure, and the verity,Hieron. in Malach. 1.

                     Furdermore this sacrifice cannot be vnderstood of the sacrifice of our sauiour vpon the crosse, which was offred only once, and in one place, and not amongst the gentils; neither yet of spiritual sacrifices, as of thankes geuing, prayer, fasting, and other good workes, which are improperly cauled sacrifices, and therfore it is to be noted that whensoeuer this woord sacrifyce is improperly taken in

                     Agayne the prophet speaketh heere of a sacrifice or oblation which should be but one, cauling it a cleane oblation, but the spiritual sacrifices are as many as there are good woorkes of the faythful.
                     Also he speaketh of a sacrifice proper to the new law, and to the gentils, &amp; such a one as should succeede the sacrifices of the Iewes, and be offred in steede therof; but spiritual sacrifices haue ben in all tymes, and common both to Iewes and gentils;

                     Lastly the most learned and auncient fathers of the Churche do vniformly expound this prophesy of the sacrifice of the masse; as S. Iustin the learned Philosopher and famous martyr, within 150. yeres after Christ, sayth that,

                     NOw to speake of the sacrifice of Melchisedech I think our aduersaries wil not deny that our sauiour was and is a Priest according to the order of Melchisedech, and that he shalbe so for euer as the Prophet Dauid testifieth of him, saying, tu es sacerdos in eternū secundum ordinem Melchisedech, thou art a Priest for euer according to the order of Melchisedech, the which saynt Paule also sheweth amply in his epistle to the Hebrews; the which being granted, two things do euidently follow thereon.
                     The first is, that for as much as priesthood and sacrifice ar correlatiues, and cannot be the one without the other; in which respect saynt Paule sayth that a Priest or Bishop is ordeyned vt offer at dona &amp; sacrificiae, to offer gifts and sacrifices,

from man, and proceedeth so 
                           ••
                        rinsecally from the very grounds and principles of nature it selfe, that their can be no perfect religion nor good common welth without it.
                     For as for religion whereas the special office and end therof is to acknowledge by external acts the seruice and subiection wee owe to our Lord and creator, and the dominion he hath ouer vs, it is manifest that no external act of religion doth so fully and conueniently expresse and signify the same as sacrifice, wherby wee gratefully offer to almighty God his owne creatures, not only rendring him part of his owne gifts, and yeilding him thankes therfore, but also destroying them in his honour, to testify as wel that he is souuerayn Lord of lyfe and death, as that we hold our beeing and all wee haue of him, and depend wholy of his wil and prouidence, yea and that we owe our owne lyfe to him in sacrifice and doe as it were redeeme the same with the death or destruction of an other creature; in signification wherof,Euseb. de praep. eua lib. 1. cap. he which in the old law did present to the priest any beast to be sacrifised, did hold him by the head, wheron the priest did also lay his hands, to shew that it was offred as a price pro capite, for the head or lyfe of him, that made the oblation.
                     Therfore for as much as this kynd of worship is the greatest &amp; most proper testimony we can externaly yeild, of vassellage and seruitude to our creator, it cannot without preiudice of his right be cōmunicated to any creature whatsoeuer, in which respect it is caused by the deuynes latria as due to God alone and for that cause not only the deuil (that seeketh to robbe almighty God of his glory) but also such men as haue made themselues to be held for Gods, traue euer affected this kynd of woorship as the highest and most due to diuinity.Aug. li. eō aduersat. gis. Seeing then sacrifice is most essential to religion, and a most proper and principal act therof, it followeth that there can be no perfect religion without priesthood and sacrifice for which cause

S. Paule speaking of the translation of the law maketh it to depend wholy vpon the translation of the priesthood, saying that the priesthood being translated there must needs be withal, a translation of the law.

                        Arist lib. 7. politie. Wherof two reasons may be geuen, the one for that nothing is more truly political, nor tendeth more directly to the establishment of common welth then publik sacrifice, wherby not only a league of frindship and ciuil vnity is made amongst men by the participation &amp; communion of the thing that is sacrifised, but also their passeth, as it were, a couenant betwyxt God and them, wherby they become his particuler people, and he their God and protector, without whose particuler prouidence and protection no common welth can eyther prosper or stand. The other reason is for that sacrifice being as before I haue declared most necessary to religion, is consequently necessary for common welth, wherof the true &amp; natural end is religion, God hauing ordeyned man and all humain things, principally for his owne seruice and therfore the very heathen Philosophers, namely Plato and all his followers,

make the end of common welth to be nothing els but a religious wisdome,Plato. Plotinus. Iamblicus. Aristot. Polit. lib. 7. Ethie. lib. cap. 8. &amp; li

                     Seeing then religion is naturally the end of common welth, and sacrifice a most necessary and principal act of religion, it followeth that sacrifice is no lesse natural and essential to common welth then to Religion.
                     But to leaue the consideration of common welth apart, and to conclude with religion and sacrifice, I say that for as much as they are both most natural to man, and that the woorkes and effects of grace do not ouerthrow, but nobilitate and perfect the good inclinations and woorkes of nature, yt must needs follow that our sauiour by the law of grace, did no more depriue man of publike sacrifice then of religion, but that as he left him a most perfect and deuine Religion, farre excelling that which he had before eyther in the law of nature; or in the law of Moyses, so he left him also a most deuine sacrifice, wherby he might dayly pay the tribute of nature in a farre more excellent manner

                     IT appeareth by the premisses that the sacrifice of the Churche that is to say the masse was prophesied and foretold by the Prophet Malachias, and prefigured not only by the sacrifice of Melchisedech cōsisting in bread and wyne, but also by all the sacrifices of the old law, yea &amp; that our sauiour at his last super did exercise his Priestly function according to the order of Melchisedech in instituting and offering the same when he sacrifised his blessed body and blood in formes of bread and wyne, which I wil confirme in this chapter by the words of our sauiour himselfe which he vsed in the institution and oblation therof, saying; this is my body which is geuen for you, and this is my blood which is or shalbe shed for you, &amp;c.

                           , he sayth: this wee may see fulfilled in the eucharist, &amp; not on the crosse, but the contrary, for it was said, a bone of him shal not bee broken, but that which he suffred not vpon the crosse, he suffreth for thee in the oblation, and is content to be broken that he may fil all men. Thus farre saynt Chrisostome who is not so grosly

to be vnderstood, as though he should meane that our sauiours bones which were not broken on the crosse, are broken in the eucharist, with the hurt and greefe of his person, but that his exceeding bounty towards man is such, that he is content, not only to take vpon him a sacramental forme of bread, but also to be handled, broken, and eaten to the end he may be distributed &amp; made meate to feede and fil all men, yet so neuertheles that though it may be said as S. Chrisostome sayth, that he suffreth fraction or breaking in the Sacrament when it is broken (by reason of his real &amp; true presence therein) yet he suffreth it without hurt or diuision of his person, by reason of his impassibilitie and omnipotency, being whole &amp; perfect in euery part therof though it be deuided and broken into neuer so many.
                     This is the meaning of this learned Father, who notably confirmeth therby our doctrin, not only concerning the verity of Christs body in the sacrament, but also concerning our sauiours sacrifice therof at his last super, seeing his exposition of our sauiours woords admitteth no relation to his sacrifice vpon the crosse, whervpon it followeth that his body, which as he sayd him selfe was geuen &amp; broken for his Disciples, and his blood which he sayd was shed for many, aud for remission of sinnes, was then presently geuen and shed by him, that is to say offred by him in sacrifice.
                     This is notably confirmed by an other circumstance that is to be considered in the woords of our Sauiour concerning the promulgatiō of his new law or manifestation of his new testament in the institution of the Sacrament of the Eucharist, for as the old testament was dedicated by the blood of a sacrifice, not to come but then offred to God when it was promulgat (with the which blood Moyses sprinkled the people,Exod. 24. saying this is the blood of the testament that God hath sent vnto you) so the new Testament was also dedicated by the blood of a sacrifice,Hebrae.

of the old law,Math. 26. and to the very woords of Moyses, saying this is my blood of the new Testament; sanctifying his Churche farre more inwardly and effectually with the blood of his owne sacrifised body; when he gaue it to his Apostoles to drink, then Moyses sanctified the people of the Iewes when he sprinkled them exteriorly with the blood of a sacrificed beast, and therfore saynt Ireneus calleth the Sacrament of the Eucharist nouam oblationem noui Testamenti

publik person, a maister of a family, free and at his owne liberty to make and publish his lawes, to assemble his friends, and witnesses of his wil, and those whome he meant to make his heyres, his vicars, and substituts; all which he did;Haebr. 9. whereas vpon the crosse, he represented no publik person, no maister of a family, no law maker, nor so much as a free man, but seemed the most abiect and miserable man in the world, forsaken of all men, and therefore S. Paule teacheth not that he did make, institut or publish his Testament vpon the crosse, but that he confirmed it there by his death, and that from thens forward it tooke effect, as men ar wont before they dye to make their Testaments, which when they are dead beginne to be of force.
                     And for the furder explication of this question it is to bee considered, that although the sacrifice of the Crosse was a most absolute and perfect cōsummation of all sacrifices whatsoeuer, and a ful redemption and satisfaction for the sinnes of the world, yet neuerthelesse it cannot be sayd properly to haue distinguished the old testament from the new, for that it was as I may tearme it, a certayne common and transcendent good; indifferent to both states and testaments, whereto all sacrifices as wel of the law of nature and the law of Moyses, had a relation, as now also the sacrifice of the Churche hath in the law of grace, yet with this difference, as S. Augustin noteth,Aug lib. 20. contra faust

For he which doth geue al things of his owne power and authority doth not expect necessity by treason, nor the violent fury of the Iewes, nor the vniust iudgement of Pilat, that their wickednes, &amp; malice shuld be the beginning of our saluation, but by a secret &amp; ineffable manner of sacrifice, he doth preoccupat or preuent the violence of men by his owne disposition offring himselfe an oblation or sacrifice for vs; being both the priest &amp; the lambe which taketh away the sinnes of the world. But perhaps thou wilt say vnto me when chanced this? euen then when he gaue to his familiar friends his body to be eaten, &amp; his blood to be dronke; for a man cannot eat the sheep, but the slaughter must go before, Therefore when he gaue his body to his disciples to be eaten he did playnly demonstrat and shew, that the lamb was already immolated &amp; sacrificed for the body of the host whyles it is liuing is not fit to be eaten. Thus farre this famous Graecian, brother to saynt Basil, whose doctrin cōcerning the sacrifice of our sauiours body before it be eaten, is most consonant to our sauiours owne woords, not only when he instituted the holy eucharist (whereof I haue spoken already) but also before, when he promised it, for that whē soeuer he spoke therof, he represented the same to the vnderstanding of the hearers, as a body sacrificed &amp; dead, not speaking of his whole person, or of himselfe as liuing, but of his flesh, of his body, of his blood,Ioan 6.

when any thing is offred to God, and remayneth stil in his owne kynd, forme, and nature, it is called an oblation, &amp; so the first fruits, the tythes, the first begotten, or borne, of liuing creatures, yea and religious persons, as leuits, and others in the old law were only offred to God, for that they were no way changed, wheras al things sacrifysed were eyther wholy destroyed or consumed by swoord, or fyre, or els at least receiued by the actiō of the priest, some notable mutation.
                     Therfore seeing our sauiour being now eternal, immortal, and impassible is not subiect to death, nor to any destruction or mutation by losse of his lyfe, it sufficeth to make him a true sacrifice that he be offred to God with such mutation or change, as may stand with his present state, and condition; as wee see he is offred in this sacrifice, wherein, the selfe same body that was borne of the blessed virgin Mary, and is now in heauen glorified with the proper forme and lineaments of a natural body, is by the omnipotency of our sauiours woords pronounced by the priest, represented vpon the altar as dead, and in formes of bread and wyne, his body to be handled, broken, eaten, and his blood to be dronke, or shed, as the body or blood of any other liuing creature that is killed in sacrifice, wherby he is also in some sort cōsumed, for that his body being eaten and his blood dronke he looseth the forme, and peculiar māner of beeing that he hath in the sacrament; which beeing deuynes caul Sacramental: in respect of all which admirable mutations,Aug. in praefar.

Augustin doth notably and truly apply to our sauiour in this sacrifice the history of King Dauid, when he changed his countenance (as the scripture sayth) before Abimelech or king Achis (for they are both one) which he sayth, was verifyed in our sauiour Christ, when he changed his countenance in the priesthood, and sacrifice of Melchisedech geuing his body and blood to be eaten and dronk.
                     
                        There was, sayth he, a sacrifice of the Iewes in beasts, according

to the order of Aaron, and that in mistery, and there was not then the sacrifice of the body and blood of our Lord, which the faythful know, and is dispersed throughout the world, and a litle after shewing how Melchisedech brought forth bread and wyne when he blessed Abraham, he teacheth that it was a figure of this sacrifice, &amp; then prosecuting the history how Dauid being taken for a mad man, went from Abimelech (which signifieth regnum Patris, that is to say, as he expoundeth it, the people of the Iewes,) he applyeth also the same to our Sauiour, saying that whē he told the Iewes that his flesh was meat, &amp; his blood drinke, they took him for a mad man, and abandoned him, wherevpon he also forsook them, &amp; changing his countenance in the sacrifice of Melchisedech, (that is to say, leauing all the sacrifices of the order of Aarō, and as it were disguysing him-selfe vnder the formes of bread and wyne, which was the sacrifice of Melchisedech) he passed from the Iewes to the Gentils.
                     This is the effect of S. Augustinus discours in that place concerning the mutation or change incident to our Sauiours person in the sacrament of the Eucharist, and requisit to the sacrifice whereof I treat, wherby it hath the nature of a true sacrifice, as I haue declared before, which being considered, with the circumstances of our sauiours owne woords, as wel in the promise as in the institution thereof, all signifying that his flesh, his body, aud his blood was to be eaten &amp; dronk, as of a creature killed in sacrifice, yea &amp; that the same was then presently geuen or offred by him to his Father for his disciples (who represented the whole Churche) and for remission of sinnes; besyds his manifest allusion to the promulgation of the old Testament, dedicated with the blood of a present sacrifice, and lastly the consent of the learned Fathers of the Churche confirming our Gatholyke doctrin in this behalfe, no reasonable man can dout but that our Sauiour at his last super did ordeyn the Sacrament of the Eucharist to serue vs not only for a food and spiritual meate, but also for a sacrifice offring the

fame him-selfe first to his Father, and then geuing commissiō and power to his Disciples to do that which he did, to wit to offer and sacrifice the same,

CHAP. XVII.
                     NOW then to speake breefly of the practyse of the Apostles, and of Gods Churche euer since, It being manifest by that which I haue sayd already, that our Sauiour himselfe did not only institute &amp; offer the sacrifice of his body, and blood at his last super, but also gaue commission and power to his disciples to do that, which he did, it cannot be douted, but that they executed this power and commission, and did not only consecrate and make the body of our sauiour, as he did, but also sacrificed the same.
                     Therefore whereas we read in the Acts of the Apostles that they vsed to assemble themselues together ad frangendum panem, to break bread,
                        Actor. 30. it is doutles to be vnderstood, that they offred this sacrifice informe of bread, according to the commission &amp; cōmaundmēt of our Sauiour, &amp; that the same was the publike ministery wherein the scripture sayth they were occupied, when they were commanded by the holy ghost to segregat Paul and Barnabas,Actor. 13. whereof it is sayd, ministrātibus illis Domino &amp; ieiunantibus, &amp;c. whyles they were ministring to our Lord and fasting &amp;c. which being in the Greeke

                     Furdermore that the ministery of the Apostles in breaking bread,1. Cor. 10. was a sacrifice, it appeareth euidetly by S. Paule, who to withdraw the Corinthians from sacrificing to Idols, did represent vnto them the sacrifice which he and the Apostles did vse to offer in the breaking of bread, making a playne antithesis betwyxt the one sacrifice and the other, and comparing the bread which they brake as wel with the lawful sacrifices of the Iewes, as also with the vnlawful sacrifices of the gentils. Of the first he sayth. Behold Israel according to the flesh are not those which eate of the sacrifices partakers of the Altar?
                        1. Cor. 10. and agayne speaking of the other, flie, sayth he, from the woorship, that is to say, the sacrifices of Idols, and yeilding a reason, thereof, the cup, sayth he, which wee blesse, is it not a communication of the blood of our Lord; &amp; the bread which wee breake, is it not a participation of our Lords body, and after more playnly; those things which the gentils do sacrifice, they sacrifice to deuils, and not to God, I wold not haue yow to be partakers with deuils, yow cannot drinke the cup of our Lord, and the cup of deuils, yow can not be partakers of the table of our Lord, and the table of deuils, &amp;c. Thus farre the Apostle who as yow see euidently compareth or rather opposeth cup to cup, table to table, Altar to Altar, sacrifice to sacrifice, and therfore saynt Ambrose vnderstandeth in this place the table of our Lord to be the Altar, faying,Ambros in 1. ad. cor. 1.

Paules woords with the interpretation of these learned Fathers, it can not be denyed, but that he and the other Apostles in the ceremony of breaking bread, did not only administer the Sacrament of the eucharist to the people (as our aduersaries would haue it) but also offer sacrifice. Which may sufficiently be cōfirmed, as wel by the liturgy or masse of S. Iames the Apostle, yet extant, agreeing with ours for as much as concerneth the substance of the sacrifice, as also by a constitution of the Apostles mentioned by S. Clement, saynt Peters disciple; wherein;Clem. lib 2. constit. ca 63. they decreed, that nothing should be offred super Altare, vpon the Altar, more then our Lord had commaunded: and speaking furder in the same decree of the sunday he signifyeth that they exercysed that day, 3. seueral acts of religion, that is to say euangelij praedictionem

                        S. Gregory the great to declare the excellent effect of the sacrifice of the masse,Homil. 37 in euange offred for the dead, telleth of one that being taken prisoner in the warre, and thought to be dead was deliuered on certayne dayes of the weeke of his chaynes, and fetters, which fel from him so oft as his wyfe caused the sacrifice of the masse to bee offred for his soule, and of this S. Gregory taketh witnes of many of his auditors whome (as he sayth) he presumed did know the same.
                     The lyke also in euery respect recounteth venerable Bede our countryman in the story of England (which he wrote about 800. yeares agoe) of one Imma seruant to King Elbum,Beda Ecel hist. Angl. 4. cap. 22. which Imma being prisoner in the hands of his enemies and chayned, could not be tyed so fast, but that his chaynes fel of once a day, at a certayne hower, when his brother, called Iunna an Abbot, sayd masse for him, thinking he had ben slayne, and this sayth saynt Bede he thought good to put into his history, for that he took it for most certayne, hauing vnderstood it of credible persons that had heard the party tel it to whome yt happened.

Augustin, signa pro rebus ipsis nescientes quo referrentur, taking the figures or signes of things, for the thinges themselues not knowing whither they were to be referred, and therfore S. Paul proueth that this absolut perfection which they ascrybed to their sacrifices, could not be found in the priesthood &amp; sacrifices according to the order of Aaron but in the sacrifice &amp; priesthood according to the order of Melchisedech, which he declareth by euident arguments grounded vpon the vnity and excellency as wel of the priest, and host or sacrifice, as of the act of oblation, shewing the infirmity of the priests by their mortality, plurality and continual necessity to offer dayly, first for their owne sinnes, and after for other mennes, whereas in the other of Melchisedech, he sayth, there was a priest, that is to say our Sauiour Christ, who had an eternal priesthood, and therfore needed no successor, and being vnpolluted and without sinne had no neede to offer sacrifice for himselfe, and so was more fit and worthy to obtayne pardon for the sinnes of the people; and as for the hosts or sacrifices he sheweth also the infirmity

thereof, for that they were but only of brute beasts, and in that respect could not be of that infinit valew, that was requisit for an absolute and general redemption, whereas the sacrifice in the priesthood of Melchisedech was of infinit price, being the body of our Sauiour offred voluntarily by himselfe, who was both the sacrifice, &amp; the priest. Lastly he proueth also the insufficiency of the sacrifices,Cap. 2. by the continual and dayly oblation therof, for that sayth he, yf they could haue made perfect such as offred them, cessassent offerri, there would haue ben an end of offring them, for vbi est peccatorum remissio, i am nō est oblatio propeccatis, where there is remission of sinnes, there needeth no oblation for sinne. But our Sauiour by his sacrifice vpon the crosse, vnica oblatione consummauit in aeternum sanctificatos,
                        Cap. 7. 
                        did consummat or make perfect for euer, all those that are sanctified with one only oblation, for otherwyse, sayth he, he must haue suffred oftentymes, which as wel for the excellent dignity of the priest, as for the infinit valew of the host, was needles.
                     Thus argued S. Paule against the Iewes, which our aduersaries do absurdly wrest against the sacrifice of the Masse, saying that the same is wholy ouerthrowen by the same argumēts, not only in respect of the multitude of our priests, but also for our dayly oblations, and because wee attribut remission of sinne thereto, which they say, S. Paule ascribeth only to the sacrifice of the crosse. For the ful answere and satisfaction of this cauil, it is to be vnderstood, first that S. Paule doth not impugne by these arguments any sacrifice whatsoeuer, but only the sacrifices of the the priesthood of Aaron, neither yet he impugneth those in such sence that he denyeth them to be true sacrifices, but only proueth by the infirmity thereof, and of the priests that offred them, that they could not suffice for the perfect sanctification, and iustification of man, nor for the general redemption of the world, to which purpose he sayth of the priesthood of Aaron, if there were, sayth he,Heb. cap. 7.

                        le or our Father Adam made a bondman and slaue of sinne, and subiect to the penalty of eternal dānation he therefore needed some effectual meanes as wel to redeeme, and free him from this penalty, as also to cleare him from sinne, to sanctify him and iustify him (all which he comprehendeth in the woord consummation) and this I say, he sheweth, could not be performed by the blood of goats and calues, but by the blood of a sacrifice of infinit price and valew, that is to say of Iesus Christ God and man, who therfore he sayth, not only purchased for man euerlasting redemption from damnation, but also did consummat or make perfect for euer all those that that are sanctified, that is to say he purchased perfection of grace, sanctification and iustification, for all those that euer were iust from the beginning of the world; or euer shalbe to the end thereof, and therefore what benefit soeuer any of the faythful receiued in this kynd eyther by any sacrifice or by any good woorke in the law of nature, or in the law of Moyses S. Paule attributeth the same to the merit of Christs sacrifice vpon the crosse, for that none were euer iustifyed before Christ, but perfidem futurae passionis, sicut nos per fidem praeteritae, by the fayth, sayth saint Augustin,Aug. li. confessio. 10. cap. 43. of his passion to come as wee are iustifyed by the fayth of his passion past, in which respect the scripture sayth agnus occisus est ab origine mūdi, the lābe was killed from the beginning of the world,
                        Apoc. 13. that is to say, the death of the lambe, which was Christ, hath alwayes had his operation and effect from the beginning of the woorld: so that S. Paules doctrin is no other but that the redemption, iustification,

and saluation of man, cannot be ascribed to the merit of any sacrifice or of all the sacrifices of the old law, but to the merit of the sacrifice of our Sauiour vpon the crosse, once offred for all, to the which all other sacrifices haue relation, it being absolute of it selfe, and depending of no other.
                     But what proueth this against the Catholyks concerning the sacrifice of the masse? doth it proue that it is no sacrifice? or that it is not propitiatory for sinne? nothing lesse; for yf the sacrifices of the priesthood according to the order of Aarō, representing the sacrifice of the crosse, were true sacrifices, though they were but of brute beasts, why may not our sacrifice according to the order of Melchisedech be also a true sacrifice? being not only a far more excellent representation, of the sacri

                        ce of the crosse then the others were, but also the very same in substāce, to wit, the blessed body of our Sauiour him-selfe, and therefore of infinit pryce, and valew, though neuertheles it was not ordayned for the redemptiō of the world, (as was the bloody oblation of the same body vpon the crosse,) but for an vnbloody representation of that bloody sacrifice, yea and for a perticular application, of the benefit thereof, to all those that should worthely offer it or participat of it.
                     For it is to be considered that the sacrifice of the crosse was as S. Augustin calleth it a general cup,Aug. se

it would follow, that all men should be saued a lyke, because Christ dyed for all a lyke.
                     If therefore there be sacraments, and other meanes to apply the fruit of our sauiours passion vnto vs, without preiudice to the honour therof, why may there not be also a sacrifice to that end, especially such a sacrifice as this, which as I haue sayd is not only a most liuely representation of the other vpon the crosse, but also the very same in substance, though different in the manner of the oblation; and agayn seing the fruit of our Sauiours sacrifice vpon the crosse hath had his cours, effect, and operation from the beginning of the world, as I signified before and yet neuertheles there was both in the law of nature and in the law of Moyses hostiae pro peccato, sacrifice for sinne. Why may there not now also be a sacrifice for remission of sinnes, especially seing our dayly sinnes, do no lesse require now a dayly remissiō then did the sinnes of those that were vnder the law of Moyses.
                     This saynt Paule seemeth to insinuate sufficiently in those very woords which our aduersaries do most vrge agaynst this poynt, to wit,Hebr. cap. 
                              •

                        where there is, remission of sinnes ther no oblation or sacrifice for sinne is needful, where vpon I say it followeth, that where there is not remission of sinne, there needeth sacrifice for sinne.
                     Therefore to answere our aduersaries, and to explicat this text I say that S. Paule speaketh of such remission of sinne, as was purchased for mankynd in general by the general redemption of all, and not of the particuler application thereof to any, and therefore in that sence he sayth, that the general ransome for sinne being payed, and remission therof being in general procured by the sacrifice of the crosse, it were needles that eyther the same or any such general sacrifice, should be offred agayne; But seing the particuler application therof is needful for the remission of sinne, no lesse now, then it was in the old law, yt foloweth that some sacrifice is now as needful as then it was, where

Paule, who denieth not the sacrifices of the old law to be true sacrifices because they were dayly offred, but to be, as I may tearme it, that redemptory &amp; absolut sacrifice, which was to be offred but once; wherevpō it followeth that the obiections of our aduersaries out of S. Paule as wel concerning the multiplicity and succession of our Priests, as the multitude and iteration of masses, are most absurd and friuolous, for though wee should grant it to bee true (as it is most fals) that eyther wee haue such a succession or multiplicity of Priests or such variety of hosts and sacrifices in our masse as was in the old law, yet S. Paules argument would proue no more against vs, then it did against the Iewes, I meane it would not follow theron, than the masse is no sacrifice, no more then it followeth of the same argument, that the sacrifices of the Iewes were not true sacrifices, which S. Paule neuer denied, but it would follow that the masse should not be that absolut and independant sacrifice which was to redeeme the woorld, the which wee deny not and therfore this their obiection out of saynt Paule proueth nothing but their owne blyndnes, or malice that do not or wil not vnderstand eyther him, or vs, in this matter.
                     But to satisfy this poynt more fully, it is to be considered

that the multitude of our Priests doth no more contradict the vnity of Christs priest-hood, then the multitude of Doctors &amp; Pastors in the Churche, (by whome he feedeth &amp; teacheth the same) doth contradict the vnity of his Pastoral office and dignity,Corinth. p. 5. In which respect saynt Paule sayth pro Christo legatione fungimur tanquam Deo exhortante per nos, that is to say wee are Embassadours or delegats of Christ; for God, as it were doth exhort by vs.
                     
                     To which purpose it is to be vnderstood, that our Priests are not absolute of themselues, and indepēdant, as were the Priests in the old law, who succeeded one an other in equal power and dignity, (I meane the high Priests of whome only S. Paule speaketh) for though Aaron was the first, yet euery successor of his was as absolute as he, and not depē
                        dant of him, in which sence saynt Paule calleth them many, because being euery one an absolute head of himselfe, succeding one an other, they grew in tyme, to a great multitude of heads to whome he therfore opposeth the vnity of Melchisedechs priest-hood consisting in the one and only person of Christ, whose substitutes and ministers our Priests are (and not his successors) offring sacrifice, and executing their function in his name and as S. Cyprian sayth vice illius,

                        This sacrifice sayth he is an example of that sacrifice vpon the crosse, for wee alwayes offer the very self same thing, not now one lambe and another to morrow, but the very same; therefore this is one sacrifice; for otherwyse because it is offred in many places, there should be many Christs, thus farre saynt Chrysostome.

                        athers of the Churche; who liuing in such tymes as these matters were not in controuersy, can not be suspected of parciality, and much lesse of ignorance of the scriptures, seing their learned commentaries and expositions thereof geue sufficient testimony of their continual trauails &amp; labours therin, besydes that their most vertuous lyues led in continual prayer, pance and religious discipline (for the which the Christian world admireth, and honoreth them as great seruants of God and saynts,) is a sufficient argumēt, that God rather assisted them with his spirit in the vnderstāding of the scripture, then Martin Luther, Zwinglius, Beza, Caluin and such other flagitious, and wicked apostatats, whose vicious and leud lyues (whereof the world is yet a witnes) do manifestly declare, with what kynd of spirit, they were possessed.
                     Therefore he that would leaue the general consent of al the ancient fathers, to follow the phantastical or rather phrenetical opinions of these new fangled fellowes, deserueth to be deceiued, and can haue no excuse of wilful blyndnes eyther before God or the world.
                     But now to conclude this question concerning the sacrifice of the Masse I draw out of all the premisses 4. conclusions.
                     The first is that, which at the first I vndertook to proue, to wit, that the oblation of the blessed body and blood of our Sauiour Iesus Christ (which wee caul the Masse) ys the proper sacrifice of the new testament, prophesied by Malachias, prefigured by the sacrifice of Melchisedech, promised, instituted and offred, by our Sauiour, practised

by his Apostles, and by the Churche euer since.
                     The second is, that it is propitiatory not only for the liuing but also for the dead.
                     The third, that the heretykes of this tyme that contradict &amp; abolish the same, hold not the law of the new Testament instituted by Christ, seing they haue not the proper priesthood and sacrifice therof, without the which the sayd law and Testament cannot be, S. Paule teaching such a necessary concurrence of the one with the other, that he affirmeth, that the priesthood being translated the law must also of necessity be translated as I haue shewed before,Hebr. 7. therfore seeing they haue not this priesthood and sacrifice, it followith they haue not the law and Testament of Christ, which can not be without the same.
                     The fourth poynt that followeth of the premisses, is that they are most pernicious enemies of humainkind, seing they labour to depriue vs, of the most souerain remedy that God of his infinit goodnes hath left vs for the reparation of our dayly wracks by sinne, and for the consolation both of the quick and the dead; for which cause the old Christians in the persecutions vnder Dioclesian, being persecuted for hearing masse, as wee are now (as I haue shewed in the beginning of this treatise) answered the tyrants that the masse was spes salus que Christiantum, the hope and health, or saluation of Christians,

                        Churches shalbe lyke cottages, and that the precious body and blood of Christ shal not be in those dayes, the liturgy shalbe taken a way, the singing of the Psalmes shal ceasse and the reading of the scripture shal not be heard, thus farre saynt Hipolitus, that wrote within 250. yeares after Christ.
                     Seing then the Caluinists, and Lutherans abolish the sacrifice of the masse, yea and bring christian religion to a very desolation and ruine, ouerthrowing altars, churches, monasteries, images, relickes of saynts, the signe of the crosse, sacraments, ceremonies and all external memories, and monuments of christianity, and in steed of the blessed body and blood of our sauiour, bring into the churche nothing but a bare signe therof, what els are they but true figures, or the forerunners of Antichrist,Danielle c. 9 that shal set vp the abomination of desolation in the temple of God, as sayth the Prophet, that is to say, shal bring an abominable desolation vpon the Churche and true religion of Christ?

                        that sayth to mee Lord, Lord, shal enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he which doth the wil of my Father, by all which wee see that good workes are necessary to saluation, and must concurre therto, with the merits of Christs passion, which being the root &amp; fountayne of all mannes merit, giueth as it were lyfe and force, both to fayth, and also to the good workes of faythful men to make them meritorious before God, wherin three things are to be noted, for the better explication of this matter.
                     The first is; that there is two manners of iustification, the one, the iustification of the wicked man be he infidel or christian in mortal sinne, the other the iustification of the iust man, or an increase of Iustice; the first proceedeth merely

of the grace of God without merit of workes, for that it is not in the power of nature being auerted and alienat from God to conuert it selfe vnto him, without his grace &amp; vocation,Roman 2 3. 5. &amp; therfore S. Paule worthely excludeth frō the first iustificatiō both of the Iewes, &amp; the gentils all merit of man. The second, which is the iustification of the iust man, or encrease of Iustice, is procured by good woorkes proceeding of Gods grace, without the which their can be no iustification, and therfore the Catholikes do teach not only the precedence of Gods grace before euery good woork,Psalmo. 51 according to that of the prophet misericordia eius praeueniet me, his mercy shal preuent or goe before me,

                     Of the first iustification S. Paule sayth in diners places that wee are iustified gratis, freely or for nothing, by the grace of God, by fayth, and not by woorkes,

Peter, S. Iohn, S. Iames, and S. Iude did expressely direct their intentions in their Epistles to proue the necessity of good workes,

and iustification therby, and thus much for the first poynt.
                     
                         The second poynt that I wish to be noted is, that where woorkes are at any tyme excluded in the scriptures, Fathers, or councels from iustification, it is alwayes to be vnderstood eyther of woorkes done by the only force of nature before fayth, or of woorkes of the law of Moyses, proceeding only of the force of the law, or of woorkes of the faythful not proceeding of Gods grace.
                     
                         The third poynt is, that all the reason of merit in mānes fayth, or woorkes proceedeth of two grounds, the one the grace of God, which moueth &amp; enableth a man therto; the other the promisse of almighty God to reward thesame in both which the merits of Christs passion are euer presuposed to be the first foundation of all the buylding; with which presupposition our Sauiour sayth,Math. 10. &amp; Marc 9. 
                        he which geues but a cup of cold water in my name shal not loose his reward, and agayne to his Disciples your reward is copious in heauen,
                        Matth. 5. &amp; Luc 6. &amp; speaking of the Iudgement at the later day, he playnly ascribeth the reward of lyfe euerlasting to workes, saying, come yee blessed of my Father and possesse the Kingdome prepared for you for when I was hungry you gaue me to eate, when I was naked you clothed me, &amp;c.

Paule saith, that as by the disobedience of one (Adam) many were

made sinners, so by the obedience of one (Christ) many were made iust; if then we were truly sinners by Adam, wee are also truly iust by Christ, or els our help is not equiualent to our harme, nor our remedy to our disease, nor our rising to our false, nor our gayne to our losse, nor consequently Christ to Adam, which were impiety to thinke, and blasphemy to say, and yet so must our aduersaries be forced to say if they wil defend their opinion; but for as much as not only this their absurd doctrin of imputatiue iustice, but also diuers other execrable errours, or rather damnable heresies spring all out of one root, that is to say the foresayd opinion that original sinne is not cleane remitted, and taken away by baptisme, I wil by the confutation therof ouerthrow all the rest that depend theron, and shew withall the dishonour they doe to Christ, and his merits which they seeme so much to esteeme.

Augustin sayth baptisme washeth away all sinnes, yea all whatsoeuer, of deeds, thoughts, words, of original sinne, or other committed ignorantly or wittingly,

children of the diuel (as S. Iohn sayth we are if wee be in sinne) how can we say that Christ conquered the deuil and sinne, and deliuered vs from the seruitude and bondage of them both if we remayn slaues of both? for being bondmen of sinne, as Luther makes vs, wee are also slaues of the diuel by consequent, and can it be any derogation to the merits of our Sauiours passion, to say that he made vs (who were before thralles &amp; captiues to both the deuil and sinne) able to vanquish, and conquer them both? nay is it not far more glorious to him to conquer them dayly in vs and by vs, then if he had only conquered them for vs? for by making such weak ones, as wee, tread them vnder our feet, his conquest and triumph is farre more glorious, his mercy to vs more manifest, his enemies &amp; ours more confounded,1. Cor. cap. 5. and wee infinitly more obliged, and therefore wee may say with saint Paulo, Deo gratias qui dedit nobis victoriam, God be thanked which gaue vs victory, but how by our selues no; per Dominum Iesum Christum, by our Lord Iesus Christ.
                     
                     Thus thou seest good reader how consonēt to the scriptures how glorious to our Sauiour, &amp; how comfortable to vs is our doctrin concerning iustification, and merits of workes, &amp; on the other syde how erronious, and iniurious to his passion is the opinion of our aduersaries who to the end they may with better colour and more boldly bark against good woorkes, and the merit therof, seeme to haue in singular estimation the merits of his passion; But where the ful force and true effect therof is to be shewed to Gods greater glory, to the confusion of our enemy the diuel, and our singular comfort, there they hold it to be of no force or valew, yea rather they make it a cloke to couer sinne then a meanes to cleanse it, and to take it away, and so they establish in the kingdome of Christ, the tyrannie of the diuel, whose instruments and proctors they shew themselues to be, woorking in mennes myndes by their doctrin, that which the diuel doth woork by temptation, that is

                     NOW to returne to King Lucius and to conclude, I dout not good reader but thow hast perceiued by these few poynts which I haue handled, what hath alwayes bin the doctrin of the Churche of God concern
                           •
                        ng the same, and that therfore King Lucius could receiue no other frō the Catholyke Romā Churche by the which he was conuerted to the Christian fayth, and yf I thought it needful to rip vp euery other particuler point controuersed betwyxt our aduersaries and vs, I could easely shew the same in euery one.
                     But what needeth it? seing they cannot proue that any Pope, I wil not say from S. Eleutherius to S. Gregory, but from S. Peter to Clement the eight that now gouerneth the Churche, hath taught, and decreed any different doctrin from his predecessors, whereas on the other syde wee shew euidently that in a perpetual succession of our

Roman Bishops, there hath ben also a continual succession of one, &amp; the selfe same doctrin, where vpon it followeth infalibly that King Ethelbert, and the English could not receiue from S. Gregory the Pope any other fayth then King Lucius and the britans receiued from saynt Eleutherius, and that wee which now hold communion with the Roman Churche teache no other doctrin then that which was taught by them to our ancestors, and hath successiuely come from S. Peter, &amp; consequently from our Sauiour Christ.
                     Therefore thou mayst wel wonder, good reader, at the impudency of our English ministers, that are not a shamed to preache &amp; teache the contrary, wherby thow mayst also see how lamentable is the case of our poor country wherein such haue the charge, and cure of soules, as haue not so much as common honesty to say the truth in matters as cleare as the Sunne, and teach such a religion as for lack of better reasons, and arguments, they are forst to mayntayne it with manifest lyes, slanders, yea and murders of innocent men, whome they execute for fayned crymes vnder colour of matter of state, acknowledging therby sufficiently the truth of our Catholyk fayth seing they are ashamed to a

                        ow that they trooble any man for it, whyles they confesse that they punish and put to death heretykes, namely the Anabaptists, directly for their religion, and their impudency is so much the more notorious, for that their publyk proceedings in the dayly execution of penal and capital lawes, touching only matter of religion, doth contradict and conuince their sayings and writings, wherein they affirme that they put none to death for religion.
                     But for as much as I haue treated this matter at large in diuers partes of my Apology, besydes that I vnderstand that some others also entend to treate thereof in the answere of a ridiculous challenge, made by O. E.

fraught with most absurd paradoxes, as wel concerning this poynt, as others touching our Catholyke fayth, I remit thee, good reader, therto, and so conclude this treatys, beseeching almighty God to geue our aduersaries the light of his grace, and vs in the meane tyme pacience and constancy, and to thee indifferency to iudge of maters so much importing the eternal good and saluation of thy soule, which I hartely wish no lesse then my owne.

                  AN ADVERTISMENT TO THE READER ABOVT A FORMER ANSWERE OF M. M. Ar.
                  AFter I had set downe to my self this defence or Apologie in the forme that here it goeth, there came to my hādes a certayne breif pamphlet writen in Rome by M. Mar. Ar. presentlie vpon the execution of Squier in England, which confutation thoughe for the substance of the matter it seemed to me very sufficient to giue any man satisfaction by shewing the whole matter of Squyers accusatiō, condēnation, and execution to be a very fiction and deuised for certayne endes which there are touched; yet thought I not amisse to let this Apologie passe also as it was made, partly for that it conteyneth my owne particuler defence which the other toucheth not, but handleth the whole action in general, and partly also for that the māner of both our proceedings is different, he shewing the whole subiect and argument to be a fayned thing, and I that albeit some occasion had byn geuen of suspition yet the forme of proceeding against Squyer &amp; the rest to be vniust &amp; against all reason, equitie, law, and conscience.
                  M. Mar. Ar. to proue his intent layeth downe the historical narration of all the whole matter and men touched in the same, to wit how Squyer and Rolles were taken vpon the sea and brought prisoners to Siuil, and had their liberty there by Father Parsons meanes, and how afterwards geuing newe occasion of offence in matters of religiō they were taken agayne at S. Lucars, &amp; brought back to Siuil, and there agayne after certayne monethes imprisonment, deliuered out of prison &amp; put in different Monasteryes for to be instructed, whence they fled away to the sea syde, and

excused their flight afterwards by letters to Father Walpoole that was most in daunger by that flight which letters are yet extant.
                  It sheweth also the improbability of the deuise, to wit, that Father Walpoole (being the man he is) should euer haue thought of such a fond way of sending poyson into England by such a fellow as Squyer was, suspected stil to be a dissembled protestant, as afterwards he proued, and that thing could not be wrought, nor the poyson caryed so farre but that Rolles his compagnion must know somewhat thereof, who being at that present in the Towre of London, and neither brought foorth, nor mentioned, nor yet made partaker of the fact, was a token that matters went not wel, nor were directly handled.
                  Besides this that book declareth by many examples the practises of Protestants in these our dayes for making Catholykes odious, especially Iesuites of which order Father Walpoole is, who was fayned to be the contriuer of this conspiracy which is shewed to be as farre from the condition of the man, as the matter it self is from all probability of truth, to wit, any such poyson to be made, bought and sold in Siuil proued by the death of a dog, sent into England by sea in bladders of leather, poured vpon the Quenes Sadle, as also vpon the chayre of the Earle of Essex without hurt to the sitter or ryder, the matter discouered by one Stanley, that neyther sawe Squyer in Spayne, nor spoke with him, and it was denyed by Squyer first at the barre, and after at his death, and since his death called in dowt by Stanley his first detector, (as by some hath byn written from the place where he abydeth) the force also of that poyson (yf any such had byn) is declared by reasons and authoritie both of physick and Philosophie that it could not worke any such effect as was ymagined, or pretended, &amp; consequentlie that those applauses &amp; congratulations both by woords, sighs, &amp; teares which a company of flatterers shewed foorth at Squyers arraynment and condemnation for her Maties. so miraculous escape was most ridiculous and vayne.
                  This is the summe &amp; effect of that answere as breifly set downe, as I can gather it, and it maketh the fiction most euident to all such as without partiality wil read it, though I heare say that it may chance come out agayne more ample in a secōd edition, with many Autentical letters, as wel of the citty of Siuil, as of the courte of Inquisitiō in that place, to shew the manner of Squyers and Rolles

running away from those partes with some other circumstances to improue the probabilitie of the deuised slander in England, which letters and instruments I thought not good to insert heere to my Apologie but to leaue thē to M. Mar. Ar. now at his returne hither from Rome to ad to his former Answere if so he shal think good, for that he maketh mention thereof in the same, and as for this my defence (gentle reader I shal not need to aduise thee of the substance, manner, method, or argument therof, for that the breife chapters ensuing wil sufficiently setfoorth the same, only I would admonish thee to consider maturely with thy self how rhow mayest be vsed in matters of Religion which do most import thy soule and saluation, when in matters of fact and open action thow shalt fynd thy self so egregiously abused.

                  RIght honorable vnderstanding by common fame, confirmed by letters from Italy, Flanders, and France, that one Edward Squire, was lately condemned, and executed in England, for hauing attempted to poyson the Queenes Matie. and my Lord of Essex by the instigation as was surmised of one Father VValpoole a Iesuite in Siuil, with the priuity &amp; consent of Father Creswel and my selfe, here in Madrid, I was (I assure your Lordships) at the first brute amased and much afflicted to heare that these good men so farre of in my conscience from such cogitations, and my self no lesse, were slaundered with matter so haynous, &amp; odious, and although I had re

                      (as the Poet speaketh) and the comfort of a good conscience which our Sauiour geueth his seruāts in like cases, saying to his Apostles, happie are yow when men shall rayle vpon you,

                      and persecute you, and speake all euil of you, belying you for my sake, reioyce and be glad, for your reward is copious in heauen, although I say I rested cōforted with this consideration, &amp; so resolued my self to patience, &amp; silence, yet waying afterwards, that as the Latyn prouerb sayth, Qui tacet, consentire videtur, he that holds his peace

seemes to consent, &amp; that my sylence might not onlie turne to my further condēnation in this matter, but also to the preiudice of all the good Catholyks of England, against whome euery supposed fault of any one or two (be it neuer so false) is commonlie wrested to the reproche &amp; condemnation of all; I could not forbeare to offer to all indifferēt men this necessarie defence and Apology of my innocencie in this affayre, as also to addresse the same to your Lord ships hands especially for 2. causes which heer I wil expresse.
                  The one was for that it is not only conuenient in respect of your place &amp; dignitie, as also of the duety I owe &amp; beare you, but also importeth for the preuētion of the inconueniēce aforesaid, that I seek to satisfie your honours, before all others in whose hands principally resteth the satisfastion of her Matie. &amp; the moderation of the rigour, or iniust persecution &amp; vexation which vpon this false conceyt may otherwayes be vsed against the innocents Catholyks of England, which haue neyther parte nor fault therin.
                  The other is for that persuading my selfe, that so fond a fiction, or rather so foule &amp; vnchristian a practyse tēding to the spilling of guyltlesse blood in this acte, &amp; to the slaunder of innocent people both at home &amp; abroad, could not proceed from the body of a councel consisting of men so honnorable graue, &amp; wise, as your Lordships are presumed to be, but rather frō some inferiour persons of lesse consideratiō, &amp; more desyrous of garboyles to whose examinations such causes cō

deuises, &amp; dryfts of those that contryned this infamous tragedy, but also the dishonour daunger and ineuitable dommages that must needes redound to her Matie. to your honours, and to the whole state in tyme, if such proceedings be permitted, in which respect if those ancient senators &amp; gouernors among the Romans being heathens, did think it conuenient euen for honour of theyr common wealth to chasten oftentymes most sharpely, &amp; examplary certayne newe deuisers of publyk shiftes, deceyptes, &amp; dishonorable trecheryes vsed by thē though it were against their enemyes, and in farre countreys, and to the common publi

                  FIRST then for as much as my innocēcy in this matter, is best knowne and most cleare vnto my selfe, by the testimony of my owne cōscience which is to me mille testes, as the law sayth, no one but a thousand witnesses, and would be no lesse cleare to your Lordships, yf my hart were knowne as wel to you, as it is to God and my selfe, I think yt conuenient for the first poynt of my discharge to caul him to witnes that is the searcher of hartes &amp; raynes:Psalm. 7. which manner of purgation though it may argue weaknes or want of credit in him that vseth it, (for as S.

Therfore I do here caul almightie God his Angels and Sayntes to witnesse that I am so farre from being guilty of this matter which I am charged with, that I neuer saw in my lyfe for ought I know, the sayd Edward Squyre, nor euer had any correspondence or dealing with him by letters, or any other

meanes, neyther yet euer conspired my self, or was any way priuie to any other mānes conspiracy of the death of her Matie or of my Lord of Essex, &amp; this I affirme in such sort, as yf it be not true in all and in euery part, I renounce all the benefit I expect of my Sauiour Iesus Christ, which I would not do for all the good in the world, as your Lordships may beleeue of me, yf it please yow to consider that for the only respect not to offend God, and my conscience, I left all the peasures and commodityes of my owne countrey, to lead this banished lyfe for many yeares, not hauing bene any way charged whilest I was in Englād with matter of state, or any other greater cryme, then that I would not go to your Churches, and prayers, persuading my selfe as styl I do, that I should offend God damnably therin.
                  If therfore I haue bene &amp; am contented to loose all that a man can loose, lyfe excepted, rather then to do an act offensiue to God and my conscience, I hope no charitable man can conceiue of me that I would now without all compulsion, hope of gayne or feare of losse, aduisedly forsweare my self &amp; with a wilful and damnable periury frustrate and loose all that fruit of my former sufferings.

                        nd might beFirst therfore for this purpose it is to be considered what was Squyres end therein, seing as the Philosopher sayth, the end is the first thing in intention, though the last in execution, &amp; in a matter of so great weight &amp; daunger as this, there must needes be some great consideration that moued him therto, which the contriuers of this tragedy knew so wel that for the better colouring of the deuise, they forged the most forcible motiue and highest end that

maybe, which is zeale of religion, and hope of aeternal reward, induced perhaps therto by the late example yet fresh in memorie of the last King of Fraunce, killed by a fryer, moued with meere zeale without all hope of tēporal gayne, or possibility to escape; therfore they sayd that Squyre by F. Walpooles persuasions entended the death of her Matie. and my L. of Essex, to the end to do a meritorious act, and to gayne euerlasting glorie, but the vanity of this fiction is euident, seing it is manifest, that he was a protestant as he shewed playnely at his death, when yt was no tyme to dissemble, where-vpon I inferre that seing his religion taught him that there is no merit in workes, and much lesse in such workes, how could he imagyn that the killing of her Matie. should be meritorious, or any way grateful to God, she being the principal piller of his religion by whose death the same should be endangered, and the Catholyke fayth lyke to be furthered, or at the least he must needs imagyn that F. Walpoole had no other end therin but the furtherance of his religion, yf he moued him to any such matter, could he then be so contrary to him-self, as for zeal of religion or hope of merit to seek the ouerthrow of his owne religion? this is incredible, absurd, and impossible; Seing then it is cleare that he could haue no such motiue or end as was supposed, and vrged in his accusation, what may be thought of the whole matter buylt vpon so weak &amp; fals a ground, but that the foundation fayling the whole buylding must needes fal withal? for the further proof wherof, and our ful purgation, though it might suffise without further discourse that Squyre at his death cleared both himself and vs, yet to the end that the impiety, &amp; malice of our aduersaryes may be withal so euident that they shal haue no colour, or pretence to haue proceeded according to allegata &amp; probata, (which in some cases may excusse a iudge from all offence, though he condemne an innocent man) I wil particularly examine the groundes where-vpon he was condemned.

                  ALTHOVGH I haue litle vnderstanding of our english common lawes, whereof I neuer had further knowledge, then that which I got by the experience of some fewe cases that I saw tryed at the common Assizes, and in the Kings bench (which also by my long absence from England, I haue in part forgoten) and therfore cannot proue by the words, and texts therof, nor by books cases that Squyre was wrongfully condēned, yet yf I proue the same by the approued lawes of other countreys, yea and by reason and conscience which are the grounds of all good lawes, yt must needs follow, that eyther he was condemned flatly against our english lawes also, or els that the same are repugnant to conscience and reason, which were as great an inconueniēce as the other, and such as I am sure no common Lawyer of England wil grant, neyther is it to be supposed.
                  Now then to come to the examination of this matter, yf it be true that is heer reported (as it is lyke to be, for that we heare yt vniformely from dyuers partes) that Squyre was condemned without any witnesses presented at his arraynment, vpon some light presumptions and his owne confession extorted by torment, as he sayd him-selfe at the barre, and also at his death, it is cleare that he was wrongfully condemned, for that no law can allow that such a confession should suffise for the condemnation of any man, without some other euident proofes; yt being manifest, that the innocēt may be forst by tormēt as soone to accuse himself falsly as the nocent truely to confesse his fault; which the cyuil law proposeth to all Iudges carefully to be

considered, saying that Iudgment by torment is deceytful, for that often the innocent are compelled thereby to confesse faults which they neuer committed;Lib.

Augustyn in this discourse.
                  Hereof also Valerius Maximus geueth a notable exāple in a seruant of Marcus Agrius,Lib. 2. cap. 4. who being accused to haue kylled a seruant of Titus Fanius, did for feare of torment most constantly affirme that he had donne it, though after he was executed the partie whom he confessed to haue killed returned home safe, wherto I might ad many examples of lyke matters that fal out in day he experience, but that I wil not be tedious to your Lordships, and therfor I wil only touch breifly by the way one that concerneth my self, not vnlike to this of Squyres which happened in the yeare of our Lord 1595. at my being with the Dukes grace of Feria in Bruxels,The Auctor in danger

                         false accusation vpon torments. where I was through the rigorous, yf not malitious proceedings of a certayne Iudge, brought to be accused by two seueral persons, not only to

haue intelligence which Sr. Robert Cecyl (whose honour knoweth how innocent I am therof) but also to haue conspired togither with them the burning of the Kings munition at Machlyn, though afterwards, through the goodnes of almighty God, and the particuler fauour of the Dukes grace (to whom I am therfore to acknowledge an aeternal obligation) I was fully cleared therof; for the processe being at the Dukes request reueiwed by the priuie councel, &amp; the proceedings of the Iudge throughly examined, it appeared that he had not only geuen two torments to eyther of the prisoners without iust cause, and so forst them to accuse both me and them selues wrongfully, but also cōfronted them togither in such sort, that the one instructed the other what he should say, yea and that he razed their depositions that were different, and made them agree by his owne arte, wherto the prisoners consented also for feare of new torments, chusing rather to dy then to indure the same, and determining to discharge theyr consciences at their deathes, as wel for their owne purgation as myne, and this appearing to be true by the examination not only of the prisoners them-selues, but also of the Iudges clark, &amp; the laylor (besydes that it was euidēt, that there had beene no munition at Machlyn to burne of 25. yeares before) the prisoners were quit of that matter by sentence, and I for that I was neuer in the hands of the Iustice, was only declared to be cleare and innocent by testimony giuen me vnder the hands of the priuie councel, and the Iudge was also forst to restore my honour, and to do me such reparation of the wrong, as I rested satisfied.
                  And I doubt not but yf I had as potent a patron &amp; frend in England at this present as I had at Bruxels, who might procure the proceedings of this matter of Squyre to be sifted, &amp; examined to the bottome as hee did the other, there would be found no lesse indirect dealing in this, then there was in that if not much worse, &amp; more cunningly hādled, as after wil in parte appeare.

                     The dealing of Fleetvvood vvith M. Nelson Priest.M. Fleetwood not many yeares since Recorder of London, examining M. Iohn Nelson Priest, asked him many questions, as yt were by the way of conference, concerning Schisme and the definition thereof, and who were to be called Schismatikes, and so drew him by litle &amp; litle frō one poynt to an other so farre that at last he made him by necessarie consequences confesse, that the Queene was a Schismatike, and when the poore man saw by the triumph that he made therat and by the diligent wryting of the clarke that he was fallen into the snare of some penal law, he protested that he knew not whether he had offended any law or no, and that willingly he would not haue donne it, yf he had knowne it, but notwith-standing the seruāt of God was after indyted ther-vpon, araygned, and executed, and when presentlie after the same day one M. Metam a learned and graue Priest being conuented before the commissioners and demaunded by the Recorder of the same matters,M. Metam. and in the same subtyle manner, refused to answere to such bloody questions (not to geue him and the rest occasion of so great a sinne, as to spil his blood) the Recorder fel into an extreame great rage, and reuiled him shamefully, reproching him with tymiditie, and cowardise, the lyke whereof I think was neuer hard nor red of in any Christian, no nor heathē cōmon wealth, as that those which should be the ministers of Iustice, guardians and defenders of the Lawes and meanes to keep men from transgression thereof, should procure them to be transgressours, and be offended with men, because they wil not offend: yea and vse the sayd Lawes, not as lanternes, or guydes, to lead and direct men to do their duety, but as stumbling blockes to ouerthrow them, as snares to entangle them, and as knyues to cut theyr throtes, and neyther giue them leaue to speak, nor to think, nor to hold their peace, which poynt Tyberius Caesar though otherwise tyrannical,Sueton. in Tyberius. did mislike, saying (as Suetonius reporteth of him) that in a free common

wealth, and tongue and thought ought to be free, which libertie of speach neuerthelesse we craue not, but only that it might be lawful for to think what we list (not matters of treason or conspiracy against the Prince or state as sycophants do bable) but matters of our fayth and conscience such as all English-men from the tyme that we were made Christians haue thought and professed vntil these our dayes, and all Catholykes besydes throughout the world do stil think, and this with all dutie and loue to their temporal Princes, at least mee thinks yt were reason that we should haue leaue to be silent, and not to offend the lawes by forced speach when we neyther meane nor list to do it, for as the traigical poet sayth.

                  Wherby your lordship may vnderstand what they deserue that torment the Catholyks vpō their owne braynes, and bare suspitions, without any proof, or witnes in the world, &amp; that with such extremety as they lame some, and kil others, and with such deuilish deuises as amongst Christians hath not bene hard of whereof I could alleadge some lamentable examples of Priestes hanged vp by rhe mēbers, or priuy partes, as of M. Tho. Pormort and M. George Beesley but especialy of M. Francis Dikenson of whose torments I think good to relate some perticulers omitting to auoyd prolixitie, the stories of the others.
                  It is not many yeares since the said M. Francis Dikenson Priest was taken and committed to prison by one of the persecutors,M. Fra. Dikens
                           •
                        on. who seing him to be a very proper yong man in the flower of his age, and imagining that he might quickly ouerthrow him by the sinne of the flesh, found meanes to haue a woman conueyed to his bed, who being repelled by him, and the enemy seing that the practise took no effect, but came to be knowne not only to all those that were in prison, but also to many others abroad to the commendation of the Priests chastitie, and honour of the Catholyke Religion, he was so incēsed against him,

that he caused him to be hāged vp, first by the priuie partes (which he made to be pearsed in diuers places with whote yrons) and after by the hands vntil he was half dead, and then called in many to see his sayd priuie partes, inflamed and rankled) with the burning of the whote yrons, saying vnto them after they were gone foorth agayne, behold this chaste Priest, how he hath dressed and spoyled himselfe, with naughty women, and not content therewith caused him also to be araygned, and executed for being a Priest, without hauing any other matter against him; which kynd of cruelty tending to the ouerthrow both of soule, body, honour, and all, can hardly be matched I think with any example of the old heathen persecutours of the primitiue Churche.
                  This I haue thought good to represent to your Lordships, as wel that it may please yow of your wisedomes &amp; piety to haue an eye hereafter vnto such proceedings, as also that your honours may conceyue what such merciles men as these, might make so weak a man as Squyre was to say, or do, to the preiudice of himself and others, and yf neuerthelesse they haue wrought the lyke effect (God be thanked) but in very fewe of that great numbers of Catholykes that haue past their handes in this our persecution, it is not to be ascribed to any other thing els, but to the miraculous assistance that God for his owne glorie hath geuen and geueth to these witnesses of his truth, no lesse then he did in tymes past to the ancient martyrs.
               
               
                  
                  THAT THE COMMON lawes of England do not admit torment in tryal of cryminal causes, for the condemnation of the delinquent. CHAP. V.
                  BVT now to proceed with the matter of Squyre; our lawmakers wysely considering the great incō
                     ueniences that grow of the secret tryal of causes by torment, the danger of errour, the corruption of iustice, the circumuention of the party accused, the slaunder and calumniation of the innocent, and lastlie the smal ground that is to be made vpon a confession wrong out by the rack, not only ordayned the publike tryal, which we haue in vse, but also excluded all torment from the same, admitting onely the testimony of lawful and sufficient witnesses, which being had the partie is condemned in our law, though he neuer confesse the cryme, so that the confession being not material or necessarie for condemnation (as in other countreys it is) torment which serueth only to extort the same, is superfluous, for where the effect is not necessarie, the cause is also needles.
                  And yf our law forbiddeth not, or perhaps ordayneth the vse of torment in matters of conspiracy against the Prince and state, it is to be vnderstood, that it is not to the end to force the partie to confesse for his condemnation, but for the bolting out of the bottome and circumstances of the matter, &amp; to know all the conf

                     derates for the praeuention of the daūger which may ensewe to the common welth, for otherwyes I must needes say, that our lawe should be contrary to it selfe, and that the daunger of errour, and of corruption of Iustice, which our lawmakers sought to preuent by our publyke tryal, should be nothing at all remedied therby.
                  
                     For what doth it profit the prisoner to be brought in publykly to heare his iudgment read in the hearing of all, to haue the witnesses confronted with him, to be tryed by a verdit of 12. substantial men, and to haue so many causes of exceptions alowed him against the sayd witnesses, and Iurie (as in the practise of our lawe is seene) what doth all this I say auayle him, if the rackmaister may haue the fingring of him first, and force him by torture to accuse him-selfe, and that the same accusation shal suffise to preiudice all the priuiledges that our law alloweth him?
                  Againe why are the iurors brought to the barre, but to see the witnesses deposed, to heare their euidence, and the answere of the party ther-vnto, and to vnderstand the whole groundes of the matter for the ful satisfaction of their consciences, and to the end they may geue a true verdit.
                  
                     Edvvard Squyres araignment.But in this case of Squyre what cleare euidence was produced? what witnesses were deposed? what warrant had the Iury for their consciences, who hearing by his owne report, that he had beene forced by torments to accuse him-self, condemned him neuerthelesse vpon his owne confession, first extorted in the Tower by torture and by him ratified afterward at the bar for feare of new torments (as afterward shalbe declared) besides some frinolous and vaine arguments vrged by M. Atturney and other lawyers whose occupatiou is, to amplifie, and exaggerate euery trifle, to make mountaynes of molehils and with their retoryke (such as it is) to persuade ignorant mē, that thee moone is made of greene cheese? Truly eyther this is farre from the wisedome pyetie and intention of our lawmakers, and from the course of our lawes, or els we haue the most rigorous and absurd lawes in the world.
                  But seing the groundes of Squyres condemnation consisted principally in two poynts, the one his owne

confession vpon torment, and the other the presumptions vrged by the lawyers which did seeme to fortifie the same, I wil br

                  OF THE PRESVMPTIONS vrged by the lawyers against Squyre, and first of the deposition of Iohn Stallage alias Stanley. CHAP. VI.
                  THERE was red to the Iury the deposition of one Iohn Stallage alias Stanley who lately before was come from Spayne, and had affirmed that one day in my lodging in Madrid I enueighed against Squyre with great passion, and othes, saying that he had deceyued vs in not performing his promise, and that I feared we should be vtterly discredited with the King therby. Wherto I answere that I protest before God, and vpon my saluation, that I neuer said any such thing to Stanley in my lyfe, neyther is their any man (I suppose) that knoweth him and me, and both our qualities, behauiours and conditions, wil thinke it probable that I would vse such wordes before him if there had byn cause, or that so easely, and eagerlie I would fal to sweareing vpon the suddayne, which hath byn so farre of from all the rest of my former lyfe, as my acquaintance wil beare me witnesse.

                  And as for his behauiour heer, I assure your Lordships, that within a fewe dayes after he was set at libertie, and that we had noted his demeanour, we were both weary &amp; ashamed of him, for besydes his vyle and scandalous lyfe, to bad to be told, he would sometymes be in such desperate moodes that he would blaspheeme God, saying that he could not forgeue his sinnes, and sometymes threaten to make himself away, because he was not regarded and rewarded according to his expectation, though much better then his lewd conditions deserued, and to giue your Lordships some particuler examples of his trecherie, yea and his periurie (which for the mater in hand is most to be considered) your honours shal vnderstand that first he betrayed his owne fellow prisoners in Siuil reuealing certayne treatyes and practises they had in hand for their libertie, and other purposes, and caused some letters they had written to some of your Lorships to be taken; Secōdly he discouered an English ship that aryued there, not for any zeale to this Kings seruice, but in hope to get a third parte of the goods, &amp; lastly accused a frenchman called Thomas Dobret to be an English man, my Lord of Essex his seruāt,

and his spy, which neuerthelesse presently vpon his escape from hence he reuoked by certayne letters that he wrote from S.

                  Therefore to conclude if such a testimonie as this of Stanley be held good in our law, (as it is in no law els of the world) such a gappe is layd open to calumniatours, as no man in England can make account that this head is sure vpon his shoulders.

                  And although in some cases our lawes admit one only witnes, yet the same cannot be with any reason or conscience practised, but when the iurers themselues haue so

sufficient knowlege of the matter, that they need not any further testimony for which purpose our law ordayneth (yf I be not deceaued) that the Iury shalbe impaneled in the same county where the acte was donne, to the end that the iurers, may haue (eyther all or some of them at least) some perticular vnderstanding thereof. But in such cases as this of Squyre (whereof the Iury could haue no knowlege but by the euidence and proofes produced) our lawes cannot so far disagree from all other lawes humain and diuine, as to cōdemne a man to death vpon the testimony of one alone, though it bee neuer so direct and pertinent to the purpose and much les when it is so indirect weak and impertinent as was this testimony of Stanley.
                  Furthermore seeing that Stanley was not deposed in the presence of the prisoner, nor of the Iury but only his deposition red, how did the Iurie know for the satisfaction and discharge of their consciences, whether he had geuen his testimony voluntarily or by violence, and whether he would stand vnto it to Squyres face or no, which they were bound to consider, yea and to be assured of yt before they should find him guyltie vpon his euidence, for no doubt to those ends the law ordayneth the publike presentation and deposition of the witnesses before the Iurie &amp; the prisoner, for what might be thought, but if Stanley had sayd any such thing, yet that he had reuoked it agayne, and would not stand vnto it, or that there was some other iugling in the matter seing he being then liuing, and in the tower was not brought to the court to be deposed there &amp; confronted with the prisoner as reason and the custome of our law requireth,

                     Therfore to conclude seeing that Stanley was subiect to all exceptions aswel for his lewd conditions, and suspition of subornatiō against Squyre as also for beeing but a single witnesse, and his euidence not of knowledge but of hearesay, not particular concerning the killing of the Queene nor giuen in publyke, and in presence of the Iury but in priuate, there were so many detects therin, that yf the Iurie found Squyre guyltie therevpon, I must needs say they were worthy to weare papers for their paynes and may perchaunce weare fierbrands els where if they repent not, for spilling Christian blood so wilfullie.
               
               
                  OF THE TESTIMONIE geuen by a priuie councelor. CHAP. VII.
                  IT is further reported heere that a priuie councelor being present at Squyres araygnmēt did witnesse that he had seene a letter which had passed betweene me, &amp; a kinsman of myne at Rome wherein we aduertised one the other, that although Squyre had not yet performed that which he promised, yet he continued his determination to do it when oportunity should serue.
                  Hereto for answere I do first make the same asseueration as before vpon my Saluation, that there neuer passed any letter betweene my kinsman and me concerning Squyre in any sence or to any purpose whatsoeuer, and that I think in my conscience my said kinsman neuer hard tel of him, nor so much as dreamed of him, or any matter of his in his lyfe except now by this occasion of his execution written from England.
                  Secondly I say that persuading my selfe that so great a councelor would not so litle respect his honour, and conscience

as to forge of his owne head a matter so false and odious as this, and to affirme it in such an honorable and publyke assembly to the preiudice of any mannes lyfe and fame if he had seene no such letter in deed I must needes think that he was abused by some of his intelligencers or inferiour informers, who to make a shewe of their double diligence in such affayres did counterfet the sayd letter in my name or my cosens.
                  But howsoeuer that was, in this testimonie two thinges are to be considered, the one, the estate and qualitie of his person, the other the weight and valewe of the matter, which being weighed ioyntly may seeme not a litle to preiudice this cause, but considered a parte do nothing at all hurte the same.

Cepio, men of soueraigne dignitie in that common wealth he was neuerthelesse absolued, least (sayth he) it might seeme that he was opprest by the might of so potent enemies. Such was the honorable proceeding of the ancient Romans, who thought it no reasō, that a witnes or accuser should bring into Iudgemēt ouer great power or more authoritie then ordinarie, or

ouermuch fauour, and credit, which ought to be employed to the defence of the innocent, to the help of the poore &amp; impotent, &amp; to the comfort of the afflicted, rather then to the daunger, distresse, and distruction of subiects.
                  This I am bold to intimate to your Lordships, not to blame the a foresaid wise and woorthy councelor (to whome I beare all due reuerence and respect) but to the end it may appeere that yf his autoritie &amp; dignitie, moued the Iury more then the weight of the matter which hee testified, as yt is lykely it did, it neither ought so to haue donne, neyther was it I am sure any parte of his honours meaning or desire that it should do, and thus much for his person.
                  As for the matter which he testified; I shal not need to spend many wordes therin, for that I am persuaded his honour did not speake as a witnesse, but by the way of discourse, seing that so farre as I vnderstand, he was not deposed and sworne, neyther yet the letter brought foorth and red in the court, nor proued to be a true and no counterfeit letter, which I verely beleeue his honour wil not for all the good in the world, affirme vpon his credit, &amp; much lesse vpon his oth, as it had beene necessarie eyther he or some other should haue donne to make the same forcible in law, wherof I saw once the experience in an action of scandaelum magnaetum, in the Kinges bench, where a letter of the plaintiffes being presented by the defendant, I remember M. Atkinson who pleaded for the playntife, reiected it as not written by him, wher-vpon the defendant was forced to produce a councelour at Law for witnesse who vpon his oth affirmed that the letter was of the plaintifes hand, and sealed with his owne seale.

                  THAT THE EVIDENCE against Squyre was not sufficient in Law to geue him torment, &amp; that therfore his confession extorted therby was voyd in Law, and his condemnation vniust. CHAP. VIII.
                  BVT some perhaps wil say that although these two testimonies of the priuie councelour, and of Stanley were not sufficient in Law to condemne Squyre yet they suffised to geue suspition of the matter, and to make him apprehended examined and tormented, wher-vpon ensewed his confession which being ratified after by himself at the barre, was a sufficient warrant to the iurie to fynd him guilty,L. fi cui ff. accusat B. in l.

                        i. de Sena. and to the Iudges to pronounce sentence against him of death, as they did.
                  For satisfaction of this poynt I wil brieflie prooue, first that this euidence was not sufficient to geue Squyre torment; secondly that his confession vpon torment was voyd in Law and lastlie that his ratification therof at the barre could not reualidate the same, and although for his purpose I must ayd my selfe of the Ciuil law as hitherto I haue donne, for lack of knowledge &amp; bookes of our owne lawes, yet I am wel assured, no wyse and learned common lawyer can reiect the reasons alleadged by the ciuil law, as wel for that they are grounded on equitie and conscience (in which respect they are receyued and confirmed in lyke manner by the Ecclesiastical, and canon lawes of Christendome) as also for that our law, so farre admitteth the ciuil law, that in many cases yt remitteth vs vnto the decision thereof, as we may see in matters of testaments, and mariages, and in diuers cases of the chancerie, for which purpose do serue our Arches, Admiraltie, and M. of the chancery, and this must needs haue place, much more in this case then in many others, for that the tryal by torment

properly belongeth to the ciuil law, and not to ours, which law of ours abhorring (as it seemeth) the crueltie, and rigour of torture doth exclude it from the tryal of cōmon causes (as before I haue sayd) therfore if in any case it boroweth the vse therof, of the ciuil law, it must eyther vse it with the same circumstances, and conditions, or els with more moderation seing it tendeth more to mercie &amp; pittie then the other doth.
                  Now then to the matter, though the ciuil law vseth torment in tryal of criminal causes, to force the partie to confesse the cryme yf he wil not voluntarily do yt, neuerthelesse yt ordeyneth that it shal be geuen with such circumspection, and consideration, as yf the forme and circumstances of the law be trulie obserued there is litle daunger or none at all of doing wrong to the party.

                  This being true; it appeareth that Squyre was tormented against all law, for that the matter and euidence that was brought against him was neyther cleare, nor yet

testified by lawful and sufficiēt witnesse; for as for Stāley besydes that he was subiect to many exceptions aswel of suspition of subornation, as also for being his accuser, in which respect he could not be a witnesse, his euidence was lykewise in it self so defectious that yt could be of no moment or consideration in the world as I haue proued in the 6. Chapter.
                  And as for the letter which the priu

                     e councelor testified he had seene, it was not proued to be a true and no counterfeyt letter, and therfore no such cleare euidence as law requireth to the geuing of torment, besydes that yf his honour wil be taken for a witnes yet he was not contestis with Stanley for that they did not testifie both of them one and the self same thing as is needful when the euidence is so weake as this, neyther did that letter mention any perticuler act but imployment of Squyre in general, &amp; for generalities no particuler man can be punished as sayth the law.
                  Therfore I conclude that he being tormented vniustlie, and against law the confession so extorted could not be of force to condemne him, though he ratisied the same afterwards publykly at the barre; for all ciuil lawyers do agree, that yf the euidence be not sufficient to the geuing of torment, yea and also sufficiently proued (in such manner as before I haue declared) then the confession extorted therby is Glos v

                     ted, and seing the euidence and witnes insufficient for the geuing of torment, ought to haue held his confession, and the ratification therof suspected, and so to haue at least suspended their iudgment vntil better proofes had beene produced, presuming that for as much as he might assure himselfe, that all the benefit he should reape by the reuocation of his sayd confession, would be but new torments worse then death, he resolued himself to ratifie the same and at his death to discharge his conscience, and to cleare himself, as those which accused me at Bruxels determined to do, and as infinite others haue donne in lyke cases. And that this was also his resolution it appeared manifestly at his death, at what tyme he vtterly denyed not only the fact, and all intention therof, but also that he had bene employed to any such end by any man, accusing his owne frayltie in that he had for torment belyed himself; which being considered with the weaknes of the euidence, doth no lesse manifest his innocencie and ours, then discouer the impietie of those that enueygled him to bely and slaunder himselfe &amp; others, wherof I wil speake more hereafter.

                  This shal suffise for answere to your discours of my imparting the matter to the King, seing there was no other ground thereof, but your owne imagination, which was no lesse Idle, then your head was addle all that day, being the morow after your mariage, as I vnderstand, when yow were not as yet come to your self, hauing left, as yt should seeme, not only your hart, but also your wits at home with my lady your wyfe, as yt may wel appeare by the aboundance of teares yow shed in your pittiful pleading, where of I cannot but say as Catulus sayd to a bad oratour that hauing employed all his eloquence to moue his audience to pitty,Cicero lib. 1. de ocat. asked him his opinion thereof, whereto he answered; in truth (quoth he) yow mooued much pitty, for there was no man there, that thought not both yow &amp; your oration much to be pittied, and so Sir I may say of yow, that no dout yow mooued all wyfe men that were present to pitty yow, and to hold yow eyther for the simplest, or els the most malitious man that euer occupied your place,

the simplect if your teares were from the hart, &amp; the most malitious yf they were fayned.
                  For though yow had ben a man of farre lesse vnderstanding in the lawes of England then one that should deserue to be the Queenes Atturney, and had not ben employed in the examinatiō of the cause (as by all lykelyhood yow were) yet yow could not but note such weakenes &amp; insufficīency of the euidence, such wresting of law, and consequently so litle appearence of truth, and lesse of her Maties. daunger, that yow could haue no cause of teares, except yt were to bewayle the lamentable case of the poore prisoner, yea and your owne, for being in great part guilty of his blood, which if yow saw not, but weapt in good earnest, for pitty of her Matie. your law serued yow for litle, and your wits for lesse, and I dare say there were some on the bench that laught wel in their sleeues to see your simplicity, and thought yow were more fit, (as good a cook as yow are) to be a turne spit in the Queenes kiching then her atturney in the kings benche.
                  But yf yow saw the poore mannes inocency &amp; yet could shed teares lyke the crocodil to his distruction your malice surpassed all that euer I heard of. And truly the best that your best friends can conceiue thereof, is that it proceeded from some natural infirmity of a moyst and Ide brayne and therefore I would aduise my lady your wyfe, hereafter to keep yow at home, (seing yow haue such a childish trick when yow come abroad, to cry for nothing) or els to send with yow a nours with an aple to stil yow when yow cry, for otherwyse verely yow wil shame your self, and your friends, and so I leaue yow vntil yow geue me furder occasion, which if yow do, yow may assure your self that I wil follow the councel of Salomon and answere a fool according to his foolishnes, least by other mennes silence he may think himself to be wyse.
               
               
                  
                  OF THE LIKE SLAVNDERS raysed diuers tymes heretofore against Catholykes, and of the concurrence of calumniation and persecution. CHAP. X.
                  YOVR lordships haue seene vpon what smal ground or rather none at all Squyre was condemned, and we heere slaundered, wherby yow may iudge how Iustice is administred now in your Realme, by those that are or should be the Ministers therof for the better declaration wherof, and the further iustification as wel of vs heere for this matter, as also of all Catholykes for the lyke slaunders raysed against them diuers tymes heretofore both at home and abroad, I wil be so bould as to represent vnto your Lordships sundry manifest wronges, and open iniustices donne vnto vs in this kynd, for yf this had beene the first we should haue had lesse cause to complayne, &amp; this might haue passed the better vncōtrold, as many others of lyke sort haue donne, but seing this māner of proceeding against vs is now so vsual in England that it is growne to a common practise, (and therby much guyltles blood shed many innocent men slaundered, many weake scandalized, the simple abused, and deceyued, the true cause of our suffring obscured, and our religion defamed) no reasonable man can blame me (I hope) if vpon so iust an occasion, as the defence of my brethren, our common cause, and my selfe, (that am more perticularly interessed in this matter then many others) I lance a litle this long festring sore, to the end that the malignitie therof being discouered, it may receyue some cure and remedie through your Lordships wisedomes, whome yt importeth, and in whose hands yt resteth to remedie the same.
                  For this purpose may it please yow to consider that ther

is such a symphathy betwixt persecution &amp; calumniation as they are euer lightly found to concurre and go accompagned, for besyds that calumniation is of it self a kynd of persecution, we neuer read that Gods Churche was euer persecuted, but his seruants were calumniated &amp; slaundred in which respect our Sauiour fore warning his Apostles, &amp; Disciples of the persecutions that they were to suffer, armeth them no lesse against slaunderous, and calumnious tongues, then against other furious assaultes of his &amp; their enemies, saying,Matth. 
                           •
                        . happy are yow when men shal rayle vpon yow, and persecute yow, &amp; speak all euil of yow, belying yow for my sake; and after exhorting them to pray for their persecutours insinuateth also the concurrence of calumniatours, saying pray for them,Ibidem. 1. cor. cap. that persecute and caluminiate yow; and S. Paule speaking of persecution raysed against him, &amp; the rest of the Apostles sayth, we are cursed and we blesse, we are persecuted, and we indure yt, we are blasphemed and wee beseech.
                  This wil be also more manifest yf we consider the nature and propertie of the cheife persecutour of Gods Churche,The deuils name &amp; nature. whose armes, and instruments all other persecutours are, I meane the deuil himselfe, who being (as the Scripture sayth) a lyer, and the father of lyes, yea and a slaunderer (in which respect he is called Diabolus which signyfieth nothing els in the greeke tongue but a calumniatour) can no more forbeare to lye, and slaunder, then the dog to bark, when he is augrie, or the snake to hisse, and therfore whēsoeuer by Gods permission he maketh warre against the Churche he employeth his instruments no lesse to slander and calumniate Gods seruants, then corporally to afflict and persecute them.
                  Hereof the experience hath beene seene, in all the persecutions, aswel of our Sauiour himself, as of his Apostles, &amp; infinite other Martyrs whensoeuer the Churche hath beene persecuted, eyther by Infidels or heretyks; our Sauiour was slaūdered to be a seducer of the people, to woork

Gregorie Nazianzen sayd of Iulian the Apostata, when he persecuted the Christians) the enemies of Gods Churche endeuoured by all subtyle &amp; crafty meanes, to procure that they which suffred for Christs cause should be punished as wicked and facinorous men yea and to make them and their religion more odious to all, they slaundered them commonly with matters pernicious, and daungerous to all as with treason against the Prince and State, so that whilest they were punished as publyke enemies &amp; neyther fauoured nor pittied by any, their persecutors had free scope to discharge all

their furie vpon them without contradiction.
                  This hauing beene alwayes the custome and practise of the enemies of the Christian, and Catholyke fayth, which we professe, yt is no marueil though those which impugne the same in England in these our dayes (prouoked or rather possessed by the same spirit of lyes, and calūniations, that their praedecessours were) do hold the same course that they haue donne partly slaundering vs with such deuised matter as this of Squyre, which neuer had essence or being in rerum natura, but only in imagination and fiction of the deuisers, and partly ordayning lawes and statutes, wherby some principal points of Catholyke Religion, or els some necessarie consequence, exercise and issue therof being made treason many may be intrapped within some shew of offence against these lawes and statutes, whervpon agayne yt enseweth that the common people (who hold for Gospel all that our English parlament enacteth, and haue not the capacitie to discerne betwixt a true and a fayned treason) hearing that the Catholykes are alwayes put to death as traytours (whome they vnderstand to be none but such as commit some heynous crymes against the Prince or state) are brought to imagyn that all Catholyks are perturbers, and enemies of the common wealth, and that their religion is not the common, and general religion of Christendome or that ancient fayth in which all their forefathers liued, and dyed, and our Realme florished so many hundred yeares together, but rather some particuler, and pestilent opinion of some sect sprong vp of late, that cannot stand with the safety of Kinges, and Princes, nor with the quietnes of their states.
                  And verely I dare say that such of the common sorte as are not aboue 40. yeares of age, and neuer saw Catholyke tymes in England and haue heard of so many executions of trayterous papists,The falshood of the English persecuto

Father Campion of the Societye of Iesus, &amp; of eleuē venerable Priests with him, and do remember the notorious iniustice donne vnto them in sight of all the world, who were indyted and condemned in the yeare of our Lord 1581.

                  Then came they to declare how many wayes rebellions and tumultes had byn attempted by such kynd of people, as the excommunication of Pius Quintus, the hanging vp of it by M. Felton, the rysing in the North by the Earles of Northumberland and Westmerland, the late attempts of Doctor Sanders and others in Ireland, and when no end was made in amplifying &amp; exaggerating of these matters, the prisoners often tymes desyred that they would come to the perticuler poynts of the inditement and proue some particularities against any one of them of whom some said that nothing was alleadged but original sinne, &amp; the factes of others, some that they were very children when most of the matters alleadged did happen, some that they were of farre different places, states and conditions.
                  And when these accusers or rather declamers went stil forward to vrge the insurrections of other Catholykes against these that were present F. Campion among other thinges sayd, Sir, supposing that diuers men Catholyke in Religion hauing for the sayd Religion, or other causes taken sometymes armes (as of Protestants

also I thinke, no man can deny yt that considereth what hath passed in our dayes in Germanie, Fraunce, Flaunders and Scotland) yet what is this to any of vs heere at the barre, though we be of the same Religion, this doth not proue vs to be of the same action; yf a sheep were stolne and a whole familie called in question for the same were it a good manner of proceeding for the accusers to say your great grand fathers and fathers, and sisters and kynsfolke loued all mutton, ergo yow haue stolne the sheep, if yow wil proue any thing against vs M.

                  This sayd that seruant of God, and to all indifferent men that were present his demaund seemed most iust and reasonable, but yet would yt not be hard for a great while, at last notwithstanding were brought in certayne witnesses whose names were Slead, Cradock, Munday, &amp; Eliot. The first had bene a seruing man in Rome and sayd he had heard by common report that some styrres were lyke to be shortlie in England; Cradock had byn a broken Merchant about Italie, and imprisoned in Rome for a spie and testified of one that to comfort him in prison should say, he has happie that he was foorth of England, seing yt was lyke that great troubles would ensewe there; Munday was a player of commedies, and had byn some fewe dayes in Roome, and could say litle or nothing at all; Eliot was a seruingman who hauing byn a Catholyke before, but now in danger for stealing away a yong gentlewoman out of M. Ropers house, and for suspition of a robery for which he and his frends were boūd to appeare at the next assyses) to get himself free, betrayed first his best and greatest frend M. Payne a Priest, and afterward took F. Campion and now came into iudgment, not to accuse any particuler man present of any matter of weight but to make them odious by relating a certayne

fiction of his owne against M. Payne absent but in the tower whom he accused to haue told him of a deuise that had byn thought of to kyl her Matie. in tyme of progresse or hunting with fiftie armed men, which the other after vpon his death took to be most false.
                  Now then all these witnesses being brought in, and saying no more in effect them heer hath byn layd downe how insufficient there depositions were to condemne any one of his companie, and much lesse all and euery one of them together I referre me to the iudgement of any man that hath but common sence, for albeit we graunt that these witnesses were all honest men, (as it is euident they were lewd and infamous fellowes) what proued they against F. Campion or any of the reste there araygned? what particularities brought they of the conspiracie, and pretended inuasion as with what forces yt should be dōne, what forreyn Princes had ben treated with all, and how or by whome the matter had beene negociated, &amp; by what meanes they at Rome conferred with them at Rhemes and how it came to passe that the conspiracie came to be held by so many seueral persons, and in such distant places at one tyme, as in the end of one moneth of May? no doubt for the condemnation of the prisoners, yt had beene requisite that yf not all, at least some of these particulars should haue beene proued, eyther against them all or at least against some one of them as yt is euident yt was not, for though we should graunt that some bodie had told Slead, or Cradock in Rome that there would be great styrres in England shortlie, what did that touch F. Campion in particular or any of the rest?
                  And wheras one sayd that he had heard also at Rhemes of some such styrres lyke to ensew, what proued this against any of those that came from Rome, or yet against those that were come from Rhemes diuers yeares or monethes before or els afterward seing that there was at that tyme neare hand 200. English at Rhemes of whom it could

not be with any reason presumed that they were all priuie of the conspiracie, yf there had byn any such, and yf only some were priuie therof how did it appeare that those which were araygned were of that number seing the witnesses did not particulerlie charge any of them therewith?
                  Lastly he which testified that M. Payne the Priest, told him of a conspiracy of some Catholykes to kyl the Queene in a progresse what proued he against any of them at the barre, seing that M. Payne was none of their companie, and the matter altogither differēt from the other where vpon they were indited.
                  Was this then such playne and sufficient euidence as is necessarie in law for condemnation of a man in matter of lyfe and death, which euidence as before I haue shewed in Squyres case, ought to be as cleare as the Sūne, not general but particuler, not of hearesay, but of assured, and certayne knowledge and testified by witnesses, auouching one and the self same particulers.
                  But what need I labour to ouerthrow their testimonies by law seing it was cleare to all them that were present at their araignmēts or deathes, that they were neyther all knowne one to an other, neyther yet to the witnesses themselues, before they were brought to the barre and that some of them were in England and some in other places, at the same tyme that they were supposed to haue cōspired at Rome and Rhemes as diuers of them affirmed, and was by the othe of M. Thomas Lancaster manifestly proued of M. Colington the Priest, who was quit thervpon, and the lyke was also auouched of an other of them by one M. William Nicolson who being present and moued in conscience to testifie a truth, called to the Iudges from the place where he stood, and offred to depose that he knew that one of the prisoners (whose name I haue forgot) was other where then was sayd in his inditemēt, at the same tyme that the cryme was supposed to be committed,

The iudges knowing belyke that this was true, &amp; fearing that it would be made too manifest; would

not send for Peter Roden, but reiected the testimony of the Gentleman as improbable, saying what should any man gayne by the death of these men, that he should suborne witnesses against them? and so without further tryal of the truth therof, bad the Iurie go togither, who hauing some scruple to condemne them vpon the testimonie of such infamous, and suborned witnesses could not agree thervpon, vntil two of them had beene to conferre with Sr. George Bromley, by whom as it should seeme, their consciences were so wel satisfyed, that they found them guiltie, where-vpon they were condemned, and the one of them called Richard White executed at wrexam where he had beene long tyme before prisoner.

                  OF THE ENDS THAT OVR Aduersaryes haue or may haue in slaundering Catholykes with such treasonable attemptes, &amp; first of the end that they haue common with all persecutors of Gods Churche and how much they faile of their purpose therin. CHAP. XVI.
                  IT appeareth (my Lords) by these examples that the slaundering of Catholykes with treasonable attempts in our coutry is no new practise, but an old for many yeares, and so oft reiterate, that it is now growne to be stale and a common custome, or rather held for a special and necessarie point of state, but with what benefit to the state, it shal be discussed after when I shal haue brieflie declared the ends that the Autors of these calumniations haue or may haue therin, the which may be considered, eyther as common to all the enemies of Catholyke religiō, or els as particuler to these our Aduersaries now a dayes, of the first I haue spoken before discoursing of the concurrēce of calumniation and persecution, where I proued that it hath beene alwayes the custome of the persecutours of Catholykes to seek by imputation of fals crymes to obscure the true cause of their sufferings, and consequently the glorie of their martyrdomes, wherin neuerthelesse how much they haue fayled of their purpose (I meane as wel these of our tyme, as those other their praedecessours) it is euident by common experience, seing almightie God hath in all ages so disposed, and day he doth for his owne glorie, that the cleare light of truth, and innocencie hath dispersed the clouds of calumniation in such sort that his seruants haue triumphed ouer all the malice of men, and remayned no lesse glorious with a

double crowne of martyrdome then their enemies ignominious and odious for there double persecution.
                  
                     The glory of martyrs oppressed by calumniatiō.For the proof hereof let vs look back to former tymes, &amp; see what the persecutors of Gods Churche, haue gayned by the lyke deuises; haue they therby any iote obscured the glorie of Gods seruants, who are esteemed, honoured, and serued through-out the Christian world for glorious Martyrs, and saynts of God, and receyue more honour, &amp; glorie in one festiual day of theirs, then all the Monarks of the world in all the feasts of their lyfe? Are not the Altars &amp; Temples buylded to God in their memories more triumphant then the thrones, and trophes of all earthly Kings? doth any Princes power extend it selfe so farre as theirs, whose dominion reacheth from the east to the west, frō the one Pole to the other, whose subiects, seruāts, and supplyants, are not only the common people but Princes and potentates, Kings &amp; Emperours, that crouch kneele and present their petitions, at their toombes and monuments, or whersoeuer ther is any litle memory of them? Are all the royal robes, crownes and diademes of Emperours and Kings so much esteemed, and reuerenced in their owne Kingdomes as is throughout Christendome the least rag, or relyke of any one of them, wherto we see Almightie God geueth no lesse vertue and power oftentymes when it is for his glorie, and their manifestation, to cure the sicke, to heale the lame, to rayse the dead, to cast out Deuils, then he gaue to the hemme of our Sauiours garment,Matth. 9. Act. 19. Act. 5. to the handkerchefs that touched S. Paules body, to the shadow of S. Peter? This hath alwayes beene so notorious in Gods Churche, that S. Chrisostome speaking of the great miracles done by the body and relykes of the blessed martyr saint Babilas,Tom. 5. contra Gent. quid Christus sit Deus in vita Babilae. maketh the same a manifest argument against the Paynims to proue that Christ is God, which I wish by the way, that our Protestants in England may note for their confusion, seing that denying the vertue of saynts Reliks they do paganize with

them, and do deny therby an euident argument of Christs diuinitie, but to proceed.
                  On the other syde what honour haue their calumniatours, and persecutours purchased to themselues? are not their very names odious and execrable to all posteritie, &amp; as the memory of the other is aeternized with immortal glorie, is not theirs buryed in aeternal infamie?Sap. cap. 4. To this purpose sayth the book of wisedome that the wicked shal see the end of the iust man, and shal not vnderstand what God hath determined of him, and why our Lord did humble him, they shal see him, and contemne him; but our Lord shal deride them, for they shal fal afterwards without honour, &amp; shal euer be amōgst the dead in shame and infamie.
                  Hereby may our aduersaries partly iudge what they shal gayne in the end by murdering so many Catholyks as they do, vnder colour of treasons, and enormious crymes; but for their further satisfaction in this point let them look abroad into Christendome, and see what acount is alreadie made of their supposed traytors I meane such as die directlie for religion made lately treason, who of all Christian Catholyke people in the world are held for no lesse glorious martyrs, thē those of the primitiue Churche as appeareth not only by the publike testimonie of the most famous wryters of this age, but also by the deuotion that all Catholyks, yea and the greatest Princes, and potentates of Christendome do beare to the least relyke of any one of them, which they think themselues happie to haue, &amp; keep with all due respect, and reuerence, besydes that it hath pleased almightie God to glorifie his name already with diuers notable miracles donne by the same, which hereafter wil be knowne with sufficient testimony of the truth therof, and as for their martyrdomes I haue no doubt but as alreadie they are knowne, acknowledged and honoured by all true Catholykes so in tyme also conuenient they wil be approued by the

authoritie of the whole Churche, whiles in the meane tyme the memory of their persecutors shal be damned, eyther to the deep pit of obliuion or els to euerlasting ignominie as they may see it hath alreadie happened to their praedecessours, and thus much for the end common to all persecutours.
               
               
                  OF OTHER ENDS PARTICULER to our English aduersaries and of their disloyaltie therin towards her Maiestie. CHAP. XVII.
                  THE other ends particuler to our home aduersaries at this day may be thought to be partlie publyke, and for the common good (as they in the depth of their wisedome, or rather in the height of their follie do imagin) and partlie for their owne particular profit or emolument.
                  The publyke are these, first to incense the Queenes Matie. against vs to the end she may geue them leaue to exercise freelie all crueltie vpon vs, wherby they hope in tyme to destroy vs, and to extinguish the memorie of Catholyke religion, wherin I wish them by the way to note, how farre they are deceyued of their expectation, &amp; how almightie God doth daylie infatuate, and frustrate their councels, and turne them to their owne confusion, seing that notwithstanding all their rigour, there are at this day many more recusants in England, and sincere Catholyks that wil geue their liues for their Religion then ther were when the persecution first began; so that we see how true it is which Tertulian sayth Sanguis Martyrum semen Ecclesiae, the blood of Martyrs is the seed of the Churche: But to proceede.
                  
                     The second is to irritate also her Matie. against the King Catholyke who is therfore cōmōly made an abettor of all those fayned conspiracies, least otherwayes she being of her owne inclination desirous of peace, might come to some cōposition with him, &amp; so Christendome be brought to repose, which these mē imagin would in tyme grow to be daungerous to their gospel, or rather to their particular states &amp; commodities which they may be presumed to esteeme more then any ghospel, but how this piece of pollicie standeth with true reason of state I wil signifie hereafter.
                  Thirdly it is not vnlikely, that the deuisers of these fayned conspiracies seeing themselues employed by your Lordships otherwhyles in some matters of state, take themselues for so great statists, that they make no doubt to extend their care further then your Lordships meane they should do, to wit to the whole state and gouernment yea to the person of her Matie. though litle to her good or comfort holding it a high point of policy, and necessary for the comon welth,Martial lib. 2.

                  Furthermore the end which they may haue for their owne particular commoditie is to make themselues and their seruices more gratful to her Matie. and to your Lordships by their pretended discouerie of so many daungerous treasons against her Matie. and the state.
                  Whereto I wil ad that it also importeth your honours to consider whether any of those that are taken to be the cheife discouerers of these supposed treasons, may be thought to fauour the title of any particuler pretender to the crowne after her Matie. for in such case they may perhaps vse this artifice to shadow some designemēt of their owne, no lesse daungerous to her Maties. person then this

                  I say not this my Lords to charge any man particularly (for I know not who they are, that are the forgers of these false coynes) but because I see that the lyke practises haue beene vsed to the destruction of Princes, and may with reason think, that those which haue so litle conscience to procure the spilling of so much innocent blood by such damnable deuises as these, wil make lesse scruple to break all lawes humayn and diuine when there is question of a crowne, I therfore insinuate this to your honours as matter worthy of your consideration, especially feing it cannot be thought that they beare any good, and loyal affection to her Matie. knowing that she cannot but be much afflicted with the vehement apprehension of these supposed treasons, and yet neuer ceasing to torment her therwith, framing dayly new fantasies of fayned feares, as though heauen and earth had conspired against her, the concept wherof (accompagnied with other cares incident to the gouernment of such a potent state) might suffise to procure the vntymely death of the most couragious prince that liueth, and what it may woork in her Matie no lesse timorous of nature by reason of her sexe, then decaying now in bodilie vigeur, by reason of her declining yeares, any man may easely iudge.
               
               
                  
                  THAT THESE PROCEEDINGS of our aduersaries which they hold for polityke are against all pollicy, and true reason of state. CHAP. XVIII.
                  BVT put the case that her Matie. be so inuincible of courage, that there is no feare of any such effect to follow, yet let it be considered whether in other respects it stand with true reason of state to incence her Matie. against her subiects by lyes and slaunders, and them against her, by insupportable wrongs and cruelties, which were no dout the next way to put all in combustion, yf the Catholykes loyalty, obedience, and patience, were not such, as God be thanked yt is, and I hope euer wilbe, such I say, as neuer hath ben red nor heard of in any people so opprest, so long tyme together, so many in number, so honorable in quality, and condition, and so frended abroad as they might bee (in respect of their religion) yf they would seek the remedy that other discontented people haue sought in former tymes, whereby the state of England hath ben changed, and turned vpsyde downe, twyse or thryse already since the conquest; for how were the two Kings Richard the 2. &amp; 3. disposessed of their crownes, and lyues but by their owne subiects malcontent, succored with smale forces from abroad? &amp; yet no such cause geuen them as is to vs, who are esteemed for no better then opprob

                  To this purpose it is to be considered, that no force, nor power is so great (as Cicero sayth) that can resist the hatred of a multitude,Cice. offic. neyther any empyre so potent, that can long stand by rigour, oppression, and cruelty, &amp; therefore amongst the causes of the ouerthrow of empyres, and Kingdomes, Aristotle worthely reckoneth hatred,Arist. epoiit. lib. 5. and feare of the subiects; exemplyfying the same with the smale continuance of all the tyranical states, that had ben in his tyme, or before;Cicer epist. ad Attidum. and Caesar confessing that he neuer knew any cruel man, that could long conserue him-self and his state, but only Sylla (which yet was not long) he wysely added, that he would not follow his example; wherein he had great reason, for one swallow as they say, makes no sommer, neyther can the example of a few which escape, counteruayle a common experience, that teacheth what euident daungers do accompany cruelty, &amp; oppression, which no humain power nor pollicy cā make secure, as it is euident enough to all wyse men that wil consider how litle securitie Kings, and Princes, that haue incurred the hatred of their people, haue found in the remedyes, and defences, that humain pollicy hath inuented; I meane in their treasures, fortresses, gards, armies, multitude of spyes, wisdome and vigilance of councellours, and such lyke; for haue not a number of them notwithstanding all this, ben by their subiects chastised, and reformed, deposed, expelled, imprisoned, killed, and those that haue escaped best, haue they not commonly liued a miserable lyfe, afflicted and tormented with continual feares, ielousyes, and suspitions of their best friends? for as Seneca sayth,Senec.

                  Whereby it euidently appeareth how vnsure, daungerous and pernicious are the pollicies of our aduersaries, who following the absurd and pestilent doctrin of Ma

                     the loue of subiects is to the Prince a castel inexpugnable, and clemency a sufficient gard though he be alone in the midst of the market place, so that these most cruel and bloody deuises of our persocutours, are not only impious, but also foolish in that very point wherein they wil haue them seeme most wyse.
                  But yf it be considered how they riuet this peece of pollicy with an other point of state, and what may by lykelihood ensew thereof, yt may be thought their meaning is no other but to put fyre to gunpowder and to set all on a flame and themselues also to burne therewith, or to rūne away by the light for vsing the matter towards vs as they doe, procuring so much as in them lyeth, to alienat vs from our natural obedience to her Matie. and to dryue vs to some desperat course (which neuerthelesse I hope they shal neuer be able to doe) a man would think they would at least seek to put her maiesty in peace with her neighbours abroad.
                  But they are so farre from the same, that they doe not only incite her Matie. dayly against the most potent Prince

of Europ, by slaundring him vnto her, with practises against her person and lyfe, but also do seek to kindle him against her by infamous libels published in diuers languages, and stuffed with lyes and slaunders, with

                  What then is the meaning of these make-bates? wil they oblige Matie. to a perpetual warre not with some petty Prince or poore potentat, but with the most potēt, rich, and mighty Monark of Europe? and vpon what confidence? is yt the welth and force of England? the strength of allyes, and confederats? or yet the good successe of these late warres, which mooues them therto? who knoweth not that in power &amp; welth her maiesty (though she be most puissant and rich) yet is farre inferiour to him? in which respect that which Plutark noteth of Cleomenes King of Lacedemony,In the lyfe of Agis &amp; Cleomenes. and Antigonus the great King of Macedony, may wel be sayd in this case.

CHAP. XIX.
                  BVT albeit there were no occasion of feare, eyther at home or abroad as God be thanked at home there is litle (though no God a mercy to these busy fellowes) yet what greater indignity or iniury can be offred to her maiesty by her subiects then to abuse her royal name and authoritie, to the murdering of so many innocents as by these deuises are put to death in England, where-vpon do follow two ineuitable dammages to her maiesty, and her realme, the one the infamy that her maiesties gouernmēt doth incurre in all the Christian world, as is manifest to all those that trauel ouer other countries, or read the bookes and histories that dayly are written therof by strangers in all languages, which no trackt of tyme shal be able to abolish.
                  The other is the vengance of almighty God due by his iustice to all such notable wrongs donne by publyk authority of her Matie. and her lawes, the which what yt may bring vpon her and the realme in tyme, any man that beleueth there is a God, and iust Iudge of humain actions, cannot but feare, seing not only the holy Scriptures, but also prophane histories do yeeld innumerable examples of Gods wrath extended vpon realmes and states for iniustices committed therein; Kingdomes are transferred, sayth the scripture, from nation to nation, for iniustices, iniuries, contumelies, and diuers deceits;Ecclesiastie. cap. 10. and amongst iniustices there is none that more offendeth God, thē the effusion of

innocent blood, and therefore the Prophet exclaymeth in the person of God,Ezech. 24.

                  In lyke manner our Sauiour himself prophesing of the destruction of Hierusalem by the Romans ascribed the same principally to the spilling of innocent blood,Matth. 23. not only of his owne but also of the prophets, that he had sent and was to send, Hierusalem (sayth he) which kils the Prophets, and stonest them which are sent to thee, behold your hows shal bee left desert, &amp;c.

                  Herein neuertheles this difference may be noted, that when almighty God doth punish both he vseth more rigour towards the Princes and heads of the people, then towards the meaner sort.
                  Whereof the holy ghost declareth the reason in the book of wisdome where he speaketh to Kings, &amp; Princes, in this manner;Sap 6.

                  This my lords I am bold to represent vnto your lordships that yow may see thereby the euident daunger that your whole estate may be brought into by the extreame wrongs that our persecutours do vs howsoeuer her Matie. and your Lordships may bee free from the same in wil or consent, as I make no doubt but yow are.
                  For if the Prince and people are so conioyned &amp; linked togeather with the communication of merit or demerit,A consequēce to be considered. that God doth commonly chastise, the one for the others fault,Iosue. 7. and for the offenses of eyther sometymes destroyeth both (as I haue before declared,) if the priuat theft of Acham could cause the puklik calamity of the children of Israel, that had no way consented thereto, what may be feared to ensew of so horible and publik a crime, of our persecutours, as the effusion of innocent blood, thirsted sought, and spilt, so oft, and by so many subtilities and deuises, by slaunders and fayned treasons, by extreame torments vniustly geuen, by periuries, by corruption of witnesses,

Iuries, and Iudges (where by an infinit number of all sorts are drawne to the participation of the offence) and all this vnder pretence of publyk autoritie of her maiesty, of her councel and her

                     awes, what may be feared (I say) but that the sinne is not priuat, and particuler, but pnblik and general, and that the whole state remayneth engaged for the payment of the penalty.
                  It resteth then my lords that of your wisdomes and piety yow procure some redresse of these inconueniences for auersion of Gods wrath from yow &amp; vs &amp; the whole realme, and for preuention of the mischeefe that otherwyse must needs ensue. And if it please your lordships to geue me leaue to put yow in mynd of one necessary meane thereof, and as I haue layd open the sore, so to represent also some part of the salue, yt importeth much that for the expiation of so great a sinne, and satisfaction of Gods Iustice yow lay the penalty vpon the authors and instruments of the iniustice as appeareth by the example of Archams theft, whereof our lord sayd to Iosue,Iosue cap. 7. 
                     I wilbe no longer with yow vntil yow haue destroyed him that is guilty of this cryme, and when Phinees killed the Israelit which committed fornication with the Madianit,Num. cap. 25. he auerted the wrath of God from the children of Israel, as the scripture testifieth. Also when the people were punished with 3. yeares famin in Dauids tyme for the offence of Saule in killing the Gabaonits, the famin lessed when seuen of Sauls ofspring were deliuered to the Gabaonits,2.

For as for them (I meane our enemies) I assure your Lordships I am so far from desyring any reuenge of them that I pitty their case, knowing that except they repent, and do worthy pennance God wil surely reuenge his owne cause and ours, vpon them, and throw into the fyre, those rods of his wrath, when he hath worne them to the stumps; for such is the cours of his iustice, to chastise first his seruants and children by the ministery of wicked men (not moouing, but vsing their euil wils, and malice for the execution of his holy wil) and afterwards to punish them most seuerely for the same; &amp; therefore though he ordayned the destruction of the Temple of Hierusalem, and the captiuity of his people for their sinnes, yet afterwards he vtterly destroyed the Babilonians for hauing ben the meanes,4.

                  OF A CERTAYNE PAMPHLET printed in England concerning the conspiracie of Squyre after his death, and first of two notable lies which the Author therof auoweth vpon his owne knowledge. CHAP. XX.
                  HAVING determined to speake no more of Squyres affayre but rather to haue ended with this that hath beene said, I receyued from a frend of myne a pamphlet printed in England by the deputies of Christopher Barker the Queenes printer concerning the matter and offence of Squire, intituled, A letter written out of England to an English gentleman remayning at Padua, conteyning a true report of a strange conspiracy &amp;c. the which pamphlet doth geue me occasion to enlarge my self somewhat further then I meant.
                  For although I hold the same to be sufficiently answered as wel by that which I haue already discoursed in this Apology, as also by the foresaid treatise lately published by our frend M. A. in confutation of the whole fiction, besydes that the pamphlet it self hauing neyther name of author nor priuiledge, nor licence for the printing may seeme rather to be reiected as an infamous libel, then held worthy of further answere; neuertheles considering that the Author therof taketh vpon him such particuler knowledge of all the proceedings in that matter, that he seemeth to be no ordinary person, but rather some one that had his hand in the pye, and agayne forasmuch as it may be thought that the Queenes printers, neyther would nor durst set foorth any such pamphlet touching her Matie &amp; the state, withoue the warrant of some man in authoritie, and lastly for that the Author therof amongst many fooles bolts that be hath shot therein, seemeth to haue leuelled

one particularly at me, though he name me not, I haue thought good briefly to touch some points therof.
                  To come then to the matter,Parts of the Pamphlet. his discourse consisteth of 3. partes: the first, his declaration of Squyres confession, touching the particulers, as wel of the supposed conspiracy, as also of the execution therof: the secōd the māner of the discouery of it, the third this pamphletters cōment and censure vpon the same, interposed, sometymes by the way of discourse.
                  In the first I only wish to be noted two notorious and impudent lyes, within the compasse often lynes auowed by him vpon his owne knowledge. The one that Squyres confession concerning the conspiracy was deliuered by himself, without torture, or shew of torture; the other that it was in no point retracted or disauowed, eyther at his tryal, or at his death, whereas all those that were present thereat, are witnesses of the contrary, and amongst many others some of your Lordships that assisted at his tryal may wel remember I am sure that he vrged a long tyme that his confession was extorted by torment, and although he confessed the fact after vpon some persuasions and expectation perhaps of pardon, yet at his death when it imported him for his euerlasting good to discharge his conscience, he reuoked his said confession, not only disauowing the fact, and all intention therof, but also his supposed employment by Father Walpoole, and when the shyrif vrged him with his confession made at seueral tymes, he answered in the hearing of all the assistants and lookers on, that he would as wel haue said any thing els in the world at that tyme to deliuer himself from the torments which he endured, and being pressed to confesse at leaft his subornation, and employment by the Iesuit (for Father Walpoole was not otherwyes named there) he flatlie denyed it, and gaue a sufficient reason to cleare both himself and the father, saying that he ranne away from Seuil without the fathers knowledge, and that therfore it

might easely be iudged that he was not suborned nor sent by him.
                  And this I affirme as wel vpon diuers relations that I haue seene thereof in wryt
                        •
                     ng, as also vpon the report of a credible person who was present at his execution, with whom I haue spoken here in Madrid, so that I dare herin boldly appeale to the consciences not only of M. shiriffe who was kindled with great choller against the poore man for denying it, but also of all the assistants and beholders, who were much amazed to heare matter so farre from their expectation, their vttered by him that dyed.
                  What then may I say of the impudency of this man that maketh no bones to put in print, yea and to affirme vpon his knowledge such a notablely, disprouable by the testimony of so many hnndreths as were present as Squires death? wherto serueth all his exaggeratiōs of the foulnesse of the fact, his opprobrious speeches against Father Walpoole his deuises of charmes, coniurations, enchantments, exorcismes, cyrcles, &amp; all his Sinons tale so smothely framed, but to bewray both his vanitie and malice, seing he taketh delight and glorie in the vayne oftentation of his owne lying tongue to the slaūder both of the quick and the dead,Psalm. 11. and therfore let him consider what the psalmist sayth to him, &amp; such other calumniatours, Why doest thow glory in malice thow which art potent in iniquitie &amp;c. thow hast loued all woords of ruyne and destruction, thow which art a very tongue of tromperie, and deceit, &amp; therfore God wil destroy the finally, and pluck the vp and remoue the from thy tabernacle, and thy root from the land of the liuing.
               
               
                  
                  OF CERTAYNE ABSVRD improbabilities in the same pamphlet touching the manner of the discouery of Squires supposed conspiracy. CHAP. XXI.
                  AFterwards when he cometh to acquaint his Paduan frend with the manner how the matter was discouered he sayth thus, when tyme passed sayd he, and nothing came of it, they (he meaneth vs heere) made construction of it, that Squyre had byn false to them, one of the more passionate of them inueigheth bitterly against Squyre tels how he was trusted, and how he had vndonne the cause, and the better to be reuenged on him, is content that one (that they let slip hyther, as if he had fled from them) should geue information of this matter not with the circumstances, but generally against Squyre, partly to winne himself credit, and partly to wreak themselues on Squyre.
                  Thus farre this pamphleters wordes which being conferred with that which as before I haue signified, was vrged against Squyre at his araignment concerning the same matter, wil be the better vnderstood.
                  It was then declared (I meane at the barre) vnder the confession of Ihon Stallage, alias Stanley lately before fleck frō hence, that I did one day in my owne lodging inueigh
                        •
                      against Squyre with great passion and oth, saying that he had deceyued vs, and that we should be discredited with the King therby, and further that persuading our selues that Squyre had already reuealed the matter, we sent in Stanley to do some other great mischeef, with pretence to accuse Squyre therof, wherby it appeareth that the passionate man, who the pamphleter sayth reuealed it was my self, &amp; that Stallage was not only he to whom I told

it, but also the man that we let slip to accuse Squyre to be reuenged of him, which how improbable and absurd it is, I remit to the iudgement of any indifferent man that knoweth him and vs, or hath but any sparck of prudence to discouer a coggingly.
                  
                     Great absurdities and improbabilities.For first how is it credible that we had so litle wit, and discours as (yf we had recommended any such matter to Squyre) to assure our selues that he had beene fals vnto vs &amp; reuealed it only because he had not executed it with in lesse then a yeare? wherof there might be so many lawful impediments ymagined, as howsoeuer we might suspect him, yet could we haue no reason so fully to condemne him, that we should send one our selues to discouer it, whervpon must needs follow great inconuenience to vs, whether he had detected yt himself or no; for yf he had not, we should not only do wrong to him, but also to our selues, yea and to all the Catholykes of England in ministring matter of a new and general persecution; for if our aduersaries are fayne to inuent such lyke matters many tymes to take occasion ther-vpon to persecute vs could we be ignorant that they would do it much more yf they had such a iust occasion ministred by our selues, wherby all Catholykes and we especially should be decried euery where for manquellars, &amp; princekillers, traytours, and homicides, in all tribunals pulpits assemblies, books and sermons, and many an innocent man suffer for our cause, vpon this general condemnation.
                  Is it likely then, that we would take such a desperate resolution, only vpon a bare suspition? And put the case that he had reuealed it, and that we had assured our selues therof, could we haue any reason in the world to geue further light of the matter our selues, and so to fortifie his accusation of vs, which of it self could not haue the credit, nor consequently be so preiudicial to our common cause as when it should be seconded with a testimony of our owne?
                  
                     But they say we are passionate men, and especially I, and therfore were transported with desyre of reuenge, for so saith the pamphleter that to wreak our selues on Squyre we sent in Stallage to accuse him, because we were persuaded that he was fals to vs; let vs then examine this a litle, and see what cohaerence there is therein.
                  I would, gladly know as wel of the Author of the pamphlet, as of M. Atturney and others that vrged this point against Squyre, and vs at the barre, what reuenge we could expect to haue of Squyre by reuealing that which we thought he himself had reuealed? were we so simple to think that we could hurt him therby? truly, though these fyne heades wil not allow vs so much wit as themselues, yet they do vs wrong to take from vs ordinary discourse and common sense, seing these are things so euident, that it rather may be wondred how their deep conceits could take them for probable, then imagined that we should commit so grosse errours, so that this deuise is sufficiently disproued by the absurdities therof.
                  But how simple soeuer these men take vs to be. it appeareth that the pamphleter was not wel in his wits,A notable folly of the pamphleter. when he acknowledged that Stanley was suborned by vs to accuse Squyre, and that two letters which he pretēded to haue stolne out of one of our studies, weere found to be counterfeit, yea and that thervpon it was collected that Squyre was an honest man (which in deed was the most direct construction that could be made theron) wherby the pamphleter notably discouereth the extreame iniustice donne to Squyre; for yf the subornation of Stanley was so manifest, that it serued for an argument of Squyres honestie, it is cleare that the torment geuen to him vpon Stanleys accusation was against all law and conscience, whervpon it also followeth that the torment being vniustly geuen, the confession extorted therby was vtterly voyd in law, and by consequence the condemnation grounded vpon the confession most vniust, and iniurious,

as I haue sufficiently proued in the 8. chapter.
                  Furthermore whereas the Pamphleter confesseth that Stanley had two counterfeit letters cōcerning this matter, which he praetended to haue sto

                     nges, as directly redound to the ouerthrow of the cause which he vndertaketh to defend.
                  Wel to conclude this point for as much as it doth not appeare vpon what ground the pamphleter and his fellowes affirme that Stanley was sent into England, &amp; suborned by vs, whether vpon their owne imagination, or els vpon his confession; I lay that their charitie towards vs, and their proceedings heretofore in lyke causes being cō

                  And truly if our aduersaryes did not persuade thēselues that he would at his death cōfesse the truth as Squyre did, &amp; so marre all I doubt not but they would haue hanged him ere this, being the man he is and so wel deseruing it, but now as the matter standeth, I think for auoyding the foresaid trial of Tyburne, he may rather feare a fig then a

halter seing those that haue him in their clouches, cannot but conceyue that the truth of this matter may in tyme come to be discouered to their shame, no lesse by his lyfe then by his publyk death, so that I think he may make his wil, if he haue any thing to dispose, though the hāgman is neuer lyke to haue his coat. Thus much to the text of the pāphlet, now to the glosse, &amp; for that hereafter I must be a litle more playne with the Author therof, then the respect and dutie, I owe to your Lordships would permit, If I should cōtinue my speach to yow, I wil by your Lordships leaues addresse the same hence-forth to him and his fellowes.
               
               
                  OF CERTAINE IMPERTINENT and foolish glosses of the Author of the pamphlet, and first concerning the moderation and lenitie which he sayth is vsed in causes of Religion where it is not mixt with matter of state. CHAP. XXII.
                  IN the third page yow appeale Sir Pamphleter to the knowledge of your frend in Padua for the distinction &amp; moderation of the proceeding in England in ecclesiastical causes with what lenitie and gentlenes it hath beene caryed, except where it was mixed with matter of state, for such are your owne wordes.
                  Hereto I answere that by your restriction &amp; exception of state matters yow ouerthrow your general proposition of clemency, and proue that ther is no moderation lenitie nor gentlenes vsed at all, for where is not matter of state mixed with religion now a dayes in England, are not so many essential poynts of Catholyke religion made treason as no man can do the duetie of a Catholyke, but he is ipso

facto a traytour, seing no man can be so much as absolued of his sinnes, nor receyue any Sacrament of Gods Churche by the only true ministers thereof (I meane Priestes) but he committeth treason? besydes the other captious lawes about the Supremacie, the exacting of the oth, and the vrging of Catholykes to come to haeretical seruice, &amp; communion, vnder colour of temporal obediēce to the Prince, is not in all this, state mixt with religion, yea and to no other end then to persecute vs vnder co

                  Was not this the very practise of Iulian the Apostata who to couer his persecution of Christians sometymes caused his picture to be set with Iupiter or other fais Gods and sometymes made himselfe to be paynted with their enseignes and resemblance, therby to make such mixture of religion,

                     Sonom. Ibidem.Hereof sayth Sozomenus, Nam sic cogitabat, &amp;c. for so Iulian thought that if he persuaded thē to that, he should more easely bring them to his wil in other points of religion also, and if they resisted in this he might punish them without mercie, as offenders against both the common wealth and the Empyre.
                  It not this now practised in England in effect? for what other thing is it to annex the keyes of Peter with the Princes crowne the deuine power with the humain, the supremacy spiritual with the gouernment temporal (dignities no lesse distinct in nature, then incompatible in lay persons, and especially in women sexe) what other thing is it, I say, then to ioyne Iulian with Iupiter, and to paynt the Prince with the enseignes and resemblance of deitie, and to what other end then vnder colour of treason &amp; matter of state to make away all those that shal refuse to acknowledge this pretended ecclesiastical supremacy.
                  
                     Such then is your mixture of religion with matter of state, as whiles yow pretend to punish none for Catholyke religion, yow persecute cruelly all Catholykes for no other true canse then religion, yea and as the pharises did, yow persecute and crucifie Christ agayne in his members,Ioan. 1

                  But yf it please yow and your frend in Padua that knoweth as yow say this matter so wel to consider it a litle better, yow wil easely see that the distinction that yow and your fellowes make is confusion, your moderation persecution, your lenity seueritie, your shew and talk of mercy nothing els but a mere mockerie and playne cosinage of the simple reader, for to preache one thing and practise an other, is I trow the highest point of cosinage that may be.
                  But what maruaile is it if yow draw our religion to matter of state seing your owne religion hath no other rule, nor ground but reason of state, for albeit the substance

of religion, which now yow professe different from ours, be patcht vp of old and new heresies, especially of these last of Luther, Zwinglius and Caluin, yet that which is properly yours, and the key and stay of all the rest and maketh yow a bodie and part different from other Sectes of Lutheranes, Zwinglians, and Caluenists, Puritanes, Brownists, Anabaptists and the lyke, is the obedience that yow acknowledge in ecclesiastical causes to a lay head, which although it was first introduced into England by King Henry the S. only vpon animositie against the sea Apostolyke (because thesaid sea would not allow his deuorce from Queene Catherine (which King in all other poynts detested your religion) yet being abolished by Queene Marie her Maties. syster, and last praedecessour, it was returned agayne in the beginning of her Maties. raigne that now is, only vpon reason of state as all the world knoweth, and so hath hyherto byn continued.
                  For those polityke statistes of ours that had the vse of her Maties. eares in the beginning, considering that the Queene of Scotland being then maried vnto the French King, pretended title vnto the crowne of England, and fearing that the sea Apostolyk would fauour her pretence in respect of the mariage of her Maties. mother; yea and that the people would also incline that way, if they remayned stil in the obedience of the said sea,3. Reg. ca. 12. they hadrecourse to Hieroboams pollicy and abusing the facilitie of her Maties. good nature and yong yeares persuaded her to change the religion then publikly professed, and not only to banish the authority of the Pope, but also to follow her father, and brothers example in taking the title of ecclesiastical supremacy vpō her self, a thing absurd, ridiculous, vnnatural, impossible, &amp; therefore worthely reiected, impugned, and derided by Luther and Caluyn themselues and by their folowers,Luther Caluin Kēnitius. and the Puritaines at this day in England, and all other sectaries abroad, as a matter without all praesident or example in any Christian common wealth

or colour of Scripture, except of some few texts that treat of obedience to Princes in general no lesse to Heathen Kings, then Christian, and therfore can not with any shew of reason be vnderstood of their primacy in causes ecclesiastical.
                  Seing then your religion so far as it is distinct from others, hath no other ground then reason of state, I doubt not, but yf the matter were wel examined what God they beleeued in, that persuaded her Matie. therto, or yow and your fellowes that manitayne it vpon the same reason, and by such vnchristian practises, as yow do, yow would be found to be cōprehēded in the third diuisiō of varro, who said that 3. kynds of men had three different kynds of Gods,Aug. 6. de cinitat. Dei c. 5. the Poëts one, the Philosophers an other, and statists or Polityks a third &amp; that euery one of them had a different religion according to the difference of their Gods, as that the religion of the Poets was fabulous, the other of the Philosophers natural, the third of the Statists, polityke, and accomodated to gouernment.
                  And this is that which yow professe; For the God yow beleeue in is the Prince, your scriptures are the actes of Parliament, your religion is to conserue the state persas &amp; uefas, and therfore as all good Christians do measure the reason of state by religion, which is the true rule, and the end therof, and from the which it cannot in reason dissent or disagre, so yow on the other syde reduce and frame religion to your fals reason of state, and by that meanes peruert all the order both of nature and grace preferring the body before the soule, temporal things before spiritual humayn before deuine, earth before heauen the world before God, and which is more yow subiect both earth, heauen, body soule, the world, yea God and all, to the priuate pleasure, and profit of the Prince, as though he were the end, the Lord, and God of all the world, and of nature it self, whervpon ensew those monstrous pollicies which wee fee fraught with all frand, hipocrisy, periuries, slaūders,

                  OF THE TRVE CAVSES OF more moderation vsed in the beginning then afterwards, &amp; of the difference made by the Lawes, betwixt Seminarie, and I Mary priests. CHAP. XXIII.
                  BVt to proceed in your obseruations, you go forward to geue example that there is moderation vsed in ecclesiastical causes, where matter of state is not mixt with religion, saying, for els I would gladly learne what should make the difference the temper of the lawes in the first yeare of the Queene, and in the 23. and 27. but that at the one tyme they were papists in conscience, and at the other, they were growne papists in faction, or what should make the difference at this day in law betwixt a Queene Marie priest, &amp; a Seminary priest, saue that the one is a priest of suspition, and the other a priest of sedition.
                  Hereto I answere that because you say you would gladly learne, and that I take yow to be of a good wit and docile, I wil take paynes to teach you this poynt that you say you would so fayne learne. Know you therfore that there were diuers causes of more moderation and lenity vsed for some yeares in the beginning then afterwards, &amp; yet not those which you speak of and so you shew your

self eyther ignorant, or malitious in both.
                  The first an ordinary rule of state which those great statists that procured this change could not neglect I meane in case of innouation to vse no suddayne violence, but to proceed by degrees, especially in matter of religion, which is seldome changed without tumult and trouble, wherof they had seene the experience in the tymes of both the kings Henry and Edward, &amp; therfore they had great reason to water their wyne at the beginning, and to vse moderation at least for some yeares vntil the state and gouernment were setled.
                  The second cause was the doctrine of your owne gospellers in Q. Maryes tyme, who because some of their folowers were burnt for heresy (according to the Canons and lawes of the Churche) cryed out that they were persecuted, and published in their bookes and sermons, that faith ought to be free, and not forced, &amp; that therfore it was against all conscience to punish or trouble men for their religion, in which respect the authors of the change, that serued themselues of them in the ecclesiastical and pastoral dignityes, could not for shame at the very first, vse the bloody proceeding which afterwards they did, though neuerthelesse they forbore not in the very beginning to imprison, and otherwise to afflict, all Bishops and cheif pastours; and such others as would not subscribe, &amp; come to their Churches, for the which cause I remember that besydes a great number of ecclesiastical and temporal persons, some of my owne kindred and familie were called to London, and imprisoned in the second yeare of her Maiesties raigne, and so remayned prisoners many yeares after.
                  The third cause was the vayne hope that those polityks had that a religion so sensual, and ful of liberty as theirs, authorized with the power of the Prince, vpholden with lawes, promulgate with all artifice of writers preachers, and perswaders, would easely within a fewe yeares infinuate

it self into the hartes of all men, especially of the youth, wherby they made accompte, that the elder sort being worne out, there would be within a fewe yeares litle memorie or none at all left of Catholike religion; but when they saw after some yeares experience, how much they were deceiued of their expectation, and that through the zealous endeauours of the learned English Catholikes abroad, learned bookes written, Colledges &amp; Seminaryes erected, priests made and sent in, &amp; therby infinite numbers reduced to the vnity of the Catholike Churche, not only of the schismatiks that fel at the first, eyther by ignorance, or for feare, but also of the Protestāts themselues (and amongst them euen many ministers and principal preachers) and none sooner conuerted, or more zealously affected to Catholike religion, then the yongest and fynest wits, wherwith our new Seminaryes beganne to be peopled; when those statists I say, saw this, they thought it then tyme to bestyrre themselues, and to persecute in good earnest, and yet to do it in such sort, as they might, if it were possible, auoyd the name, &amp; suspition of persecutors both at home and abroad, and therfore they vsed the same pollicy that Iulian the Apostata did, of whom S. Gregory Nazianzenus writeth,Orat. 3. in Iulianum &amp; orat. 10. in laudem Caesarij. that he professed not externally his impiety with the courage that other persecutors his predecessours were wont to do, neyther did he oppose himself against our faith lyke an Emperour that would gayne honour in shewing his might and power by open oppression of the Catholyks, but made warre, vpon them in a cowardly and base māner couering his persecution with craftie, and subtyle deuises, enuying them, the name and glorie of Martyrdome that the souldiours of Christ had got in former persecutions, and therfore he endeuored to vse violence in such sort as it should not appeare, ordayning that the Christians which suffred for Christ should be put to death as malefactours, this affirmeth. S. Gregory Naziāzen of Iulian the apostata

wherein yow may see a true pattron of your owne proceedings, for to exemplify the same with answere to the question yow aske concerning the temper of the lawes made in the 23. yere of her Maties. raigne, what other cause had yow to make those lawes in that yeare, but that yow knew that Father Campian and diuers Seminary Priests were come into Englād lately before, &amp; therfore to make the world beleue that their comming was to no other end but to sow sedition, and trouble the State, yow did not only make those lawes, but also shamfully mundered the same yeare thesaid famous man, and 11. godly innocent Priests with him for fayned conspiracies proued against no one of them, &amp; disauowed by them all at their deathes, which sufficient proof of their innocency, as before I haue declared at large in the 11. chapter, besydes many other since made away in lyke manner vpon lyke fals pretences, and especially in the yeare 88. after the Kinges Armada had past through the channel, in which yeare yow executed aboue 40. Priests, and Catholykes in diuers partes of England, to make the world beleeue that they had intelligence with the Spaniards or had procured the comming of thesaid Armada, which could not bee proued, nor so much as iustly suspected of anyone of them.
                  Moreouer I dare boldly affirme, neyther shal yow euer be able with truth to controle me, that wheras our Seminaries haue yeilded within these 30. yeares 5. or 6. hūdreth Priests that haue laboured in that vyneyard (wherof yow haue put to death more then a hundreth) yow could neuer iustly charge any one of them with sedition or matter of state except it were Ballard executed with Babington and the rest,Of Ballard. whom as I wil not excuse, (because I know not how farre he waded in those matters) so wil I not condemne him, considering the proceedings of yow and your fellowes with Catholykes in lyke cases, yet this I wil be bold to say that if he had any dealing therin, it was without the consent or knowledg of any of his superiours, yea

or of any intrinsecal frend of theirs, wherof I could yeild a sufficient reason, if it were conuenient.
                  But let vs admit that he was as deep in those matters as any of the rest; haue yow therfore any reason to condemne all other Seminary Priests for his act, I do not blame yow heer for punishing any Catholyke that yow should fynd to be truly seditious, but I fynd it strange, &amp; against all reason and iustice, that yow do not only punish vs for fayned crymes, but also impute the doings of one or of a few to all, which was alwayes in my tyme, and I think it stil, the absurd dealing of your lawyers in the araignment of Catholykes vrging against them the attemptes of Doctor Sanders in Ireland, and Feltons setting vp of the Bul, and such like, as though euery Catholyke were priuie to their doings, or thought himself bound in conscience to do as they did, which kynd of argument your lawyers would neuer vse, if they were not eyther most malitious or ignorant, or thought all their audience to be fooles: For what conclusion can be drawne from one or some particuler to a general, as to say, Eaton the preacher did pennance on, the Pillery in cheapsyde and after at Paules Crosse for lying with his daughter, such a minister was hanged for a rape, such an other for sod

                     my, such a one for a murder; ergo, all ministers are mnrderers, sodomites, rauishers of women, and incestuous persons.
                  Would your ministers allow this conclusion, or els that lawes should be made against them all for the offence of some of them? and yet to say truly there haue beene so many examples of ministers conuict &amp; executed for such crymes that yow might with more, reason exterminate the whole ministery, as a very sink of sinne, then condemne all Catholykes as seditious, for Doctor Sāders, and Feltons cause, o
                        •
                      all Seminary Priests for Ballards.
                  But to conclude this point, it is euident ynough, that neyther Ballards offence (yf he committed any) nor theirs

that were executed with him could be any occasion of those rigorous lawes against Seminary Priests which were made some yeares before, when (as I haue said) yow had not any one example of a Seminary man, that had beene, or could be touched with any sedition, other then such as yow fayned of them your selues.
                  Furthermore what iust cause had yow to make the distinction in your lawes betwixt Queene Marie Priests,Q. Marie. Priests. &amp; Seminary Priests? haue yow found any more in the one then in the other, but only that yow know the old Priests of Queene Martyrs tyme were so spent and wasted already that ther was not left of them perhaps half a score in England (who also yow thought would be in a short tyme consumed) wheras of the others, yow saw a continual spring, that would flow perpetually, to the vndouted destruction of your heresy in tyme, if it were not stopped, in which respect, yow thought good to seeme to fauour the first, that yow might with more shew of reason persecute the later.
                  Neuerthelesse yow haue hanged some of those Q. Marie Priests as wel as the other, only for doing their function counting them therin no lesse seditious then the Seminary Priests, and yet yow say yow spare the one sort as only superstitious, and punish the other as seditious.
                  But such seditious and superstitious Priests as these are, were the very Apostles and Disciples of our Sauiour,2. Cor. 
                           •
                        . for they absolued from sinne, as these do,Act. 10. they administred the Sacraments of Baptisme, or the A

                  Thus Sir yow may see yow had not those causes which yow pretend, to change the temper of your

Iawes, nor to distinguish betwyxt Seminarie and Queene Marie Priests, neyther any reason at all to cal them eyther superstitious, or seditious. But let vs see some more of your gloses.
               
               
                  THE CONFVTATION OF an inuectiue which the Author of the Pamphlet maketh against the Iesuits. CHAP. XXIIII.
                  IN your 10. and 11. page yow make a digression to treat of the strange mysteries as yow cal them of the Iesuits doctrin, how they mingle heauen and hel, and lift vp the hands of the subiects against the anointed of God, yow wonder that Princes do not concurre in suppressing them, who yow say make traffyck of their sacred lyues; yow compare them to pirats that are publyke enemies to humayne society, and to the Templars that were all put downe throughout Christendome within a few weekes, and lastly yow fynd it strange that the Bishop of Rome doth not purge out a leuen as yow cal them, so strange and odious.
                  These in deed are very strange and odious speeches, and no maruayle for there can be no more sympathy betwixt the Iesuits and yow then betwixt good and bad, light and darknes, Christ and Belial; it is no maruaile, that the theef hateth the gallowes, the dog the whip or the woolf the mastif, that keepes the flock, neyther that yow and all other heretyks maligne those, whose schooles are your scourge,Of the Iesuits. whose bookes your bane, whose vertue is your confusion, whose vigilance and industry is the gard simple foules against the assaults

of your heresy and impiety, wherin the great goodnes of God is to be noted who for euery disease prouideth a remedy, for euery poyson an antidote, for euery harme a help, so it pleased him of his diuine wisdome to prouide against a Symon Magus, a Saynt Peter; against an Arrius, an Athanasius; against a Nestorius, a Cyril; against a Vigilantius, a Hierome; against a Pelagius, an Augustinus; (who was borne in Africk the same day, that the other was borne in England) against the heretyks called Albigenses, a Dominik and his holy order of the fryer preachers; and lastly in this our age, against a Martyn Luther and his cursed crue of vitious Apostates he raysed an Ignatius de Loyola with his blessed company, of vertuous, and Apostolical priests, commonly called Iesuites, whom though the Deuil, and all his instruments (I meane you, and all other heretykes, apostatates, and atheists) haue no lesse impugned then the catholike Churche it selfe, which they defend, yet neuerthelesse theyr holy Societie is through the prouidence of God propagate and spred throughout the Christian world from one pole to the other; and therby the wrackes and ruynes of Christendome repayred, insidels conuerted, heretyks confounded, youth instructed, the weake edifyed, no lesse to the glory of God, then to the confusion of his enimyes &amp; theirs.
                  But to come to the particulers of your slaunderous digression; yow wonder that Princes do not concurre to the suppression of this sect, as yow cal it, that maketh a traffick of their lyues; &amp; I wonder, yow are not ashamed to buyld such a malitious slaunder vpon so false a ground, seing I haue euidently proued that this matter of Squyre (whervpon yow runne all this descant) is a meere fiction a lewd, and a lowdly, improbale in it self, proued by no witnes, or euidence, extorted from him by torment, retracted and disauowed at his death, though yow shamefully say the contrarie: besydes that it is now aboue 20. yeares since the Iesuits first entred England in which tyme

yow haue rackt,

Father Campion I know not how oft) and diuers others for their cause, and all to fynd out some such matter, and yet yow neuer got so much as any inkling of any, so that this contumelious speech of yours, is but a vaine blast, that (as a man may say) shakes no corne, nor cracks any mannes credit but your owne.
                  Furthermore how childish and vayne is the comparison yow make of them to pyrats, therby to conclude them to be publyke enemies of humayn society, meaning (by lyke) by humayne society your selues, whose publyke enemies yow may in deed accompt them in respect of your heresies, yet in that sence there is neyther truth nor propriety in your manner of speech, for though I allow yow to be humayn and earthly in the highest degree, yet a true society yow cannot be called, being so dissociate, and deuided in religion amongst your selues as yow are, except it be the society of Sampsons foxes whose tayles were only tyed together and their heads seuered.Iudic. 15.
                  
                  But if yow consider the infinit numbers and multitudes of those that from one end of the world to the other do loue at this day and reuerence the Iesuits (as fathers, that giue them spiritual food as phisitions that cure the diseases of their soules, and as pilots (not pyrats) that guyde them to the port of eternal saluation) you shal easely see the vanity, and idlenes of your discourse, and eyther be forced to graunt that they are no enemyes to humain society, or els absurdly say, that all men besydes your selues are seazed with such a lethargy, or sencelesse stupidity that they cannot discerne enemyes from frends.
                  Can any man that is not mad or drunken with heresy as you seeme to be, or ouercome with passion perswade himself that so many wise pious, and polityk kinges, Princes, councels, magistrates, and gouernours (whose dominions extending from one pole to the other, do conteyne the noblest, and worthyest parts of humain society among

Christians) would be so vnaduised to receyue them into their kingdomes countryes, cityes, &amp; courtes, foster them, cherish them, loue, reuerence and honour them as they do, if they were such publike enemyes to humaine societie as you make them, or any way hurtful to their states, perilous to Princes liues, preiuditial to publike good, or rather if they were not most necessary, and beneficial to them all?
                  This is so manifest to men of discourse and reason that I need not further to enlarge my self therein, seing there is no man so simple that wil preferre the vayne and malitious conceit of a few poor sectary Caluinists hated &amp; contemned by all other sectes of the same breed, before the iudgment and experience of all the rest of Christendome, whereof you are not woorthy to be counted the parings, neyther for your number nor for any other respect whatsoeuer, and albeit I might say much more in this behalf yet for that the matter is euident of it self, and the innocency and honour of these seruants of God hath byn defended by many learned bookes in these our dayes against the barkings of all sectaryes and other their enemyes, and emulatours which their vocation and vertues cannot but purchase vnto them, I shal leaue of to speake any more of this argument for the present, and so passe ouer to that which remayneth.
               
               
                  
                  OF THE HIPOCRISY OF the author of the Pamphlet and his fellowes, and of a ridiculous miracle fayned in her Maiesties supposed escape. CHAP. XXV.
                  IT resteth now only to speak a word or two of the religious zeale, and deuotion towards God, which you shew in your g

                     oses wherin you interlace not only examples of scripture, but also cōsiderations of Gods extraordinary and visible prouidence in the preseruation of her Maiestie from this great conspiracy, for the manifestation of his owne glory, in so much that you make is miraculous comparing her Maiesties supposed escape to the shaking of the viper from S. Paules hand without hurt, but in such ridiculous manner, as in truth it made me and others good sport when I red it, for though I haue heard many fond comparisons, and similitudes of ydle braynes in my dayes, yet neuer heard I such an other as this is, and that in print.
                  
                     A ridiculous comparison.You say thus, &amp; they are your owne wordes as they ly in the book, that as the viper was vpon S. Paules hand and shaked of without hurt, so this was donne in Iuly, in the heate of the yeare, when the pores and veynes were openest, to receyue any maligne vapour, or tincture if her Maiestie by any accident had layd her hand vpon the place.
                  Of which wordes there can be no other sense gathered (in my opinion) then this that as S. Paule being bitten with the viper shaked her from his hand, and had no hurt, so if by chaunce her Maiestie had layed her hand vpon the poysoned pomel of the Sadle in the moneth of Iuly when the pores and veynes are open she might haue byn poysoned or receaue maligne vapors or tinctures. But good Syr

yow might haue done wel to haue put this cōceit in ryme
                        •
                      for so it would haue beene at least ryme without reason, wheras now it is neyther ryme nor reason, yet if yow had said that her Matie. had toucht the poysoned place, as yow signify the contrary (which marres the fashion both of your comparison, and of your miracle) there had beene some more similitude, and matter miraculous, but as yow haue handled it there is neyther miracle nor meaning, so farre as my reason reacheth, and consequently this very first miracle that euer yow had for confirmation of your Gospel in England is miscaried for lack of good handling. But to leaue this to the laughter of all wyse men, I wil proceed to some other considerations.
                  Who is he that seing somuch mētion in your discourse of God, of his mercy, of his prouidence ordinary, and extraordinary, and of his more then natural influence to the preseruation of her Matie. would not think yow to be a very religious and deuout man, or could imagyn that yow knew in your conscience, that all this matter of Squyre was a fiction, as it is euident yow did? wherof I need to bring no better proof then those two notable lyes before mentioned, which yow take vpon your owne conscience, though not only your self, but also many hundreths that were at Squyres death know the contrary; wherby it appeareth that all your shew of religion deuotion and zeale tendeth to nothing els, but to set a glos vpon this your counterfeit ware, to make it the more salable amongst the common people; which exceedeth all impiety.
                  For what can be so exce

But such is the custome of yow, and your compagnions to make a maske and visard of religion to couer therwith your impious, and irreligious practises, persuading your selues, that

although some of the wisest may discouer your treacherie, yet yow shal cary away many of the multitude, which is the fruit yow expect of this and such other your infamous, and slaunderous libels, forgeting that of Cicero nullum simulatum di

                  So that yow Sr. libeller, and your fellowes cannot look to delude the world alwayes as yow haue donne many yeares but that sooner or later God wil open the peoples eyes, and discouer vnto them your hipocrisy and disguised impiety, yea and perhaps make them his instruments to reuenge his cause, and their owne vpon yow, wherein may bee fulfilled, that which Iobe saith of the hipocrite, the heauēs shal reueale his iniquitie, and the earth shal ryse against him.

heard of diuers examples, as wel before I came out of England, as since, whereby it is euident, that these other extreame iniuries that our aduersaries dayly do vnto vs, proceed meerly of their owne malice, and no way of your Lordships wil, commission, or consent, and that for the remedy, there wanteth nothing, but that your honours may haue notice thereof, which I haue therefore presumed to geue yow in this Apology by the occasion of this my purgation, which I present vnto yow in all humility, beseeching your Lordships, for conclusion of this treatise, to consider from what root all these foule vnchristian practises of our aduersaries do spring, as that they are nothing els but the fruit of heresy, which hath no other period where to rest, but atheisme, or apostacy from Christ, as euidently appeareth by all the east parts of the world, which from lyke schisme, and heresy, are falne to flat infidelity; which if it please your Lordships wel to weigh, and the true remedy withall, which Machiauel, (though in other things he be most absurd and impious) yet wysely teacheth in this case, to wit, to reduce a corrupted state of common wealth, to the point frō whence it first declined, I hope your honours wil see the necessity of the reduction of our realme to the ancient Catholyke religion, and to the vnity of the Catholyke body of Christendome, whereof it was many hundred yeares togeather a principal mēber, in all honour, and security, florishing in iustice, equity, and piety, whereas now by this difunion, and diuorce, from the said Catholyke body, and religion, it is not only exposed to many daungers, and much in
