            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            TO THE READER.
            
               THE multitude of bookes which now adayes are printed with purity and elegancie of tongues and languages, are ſo aboundant, that it cauſeth many to reiect the reading of ſuch as they ought to haue alwayes in hand for edification and profit of their ſoules, and not for curioſitie, in regard that though al good and true doctrine, ought to be highly eſteemed as the nourishment of the ſoule (the foode wherofis, the intellectuall vnderſtanding of the truth:) yet ought the diſcret and Chriſtian Reader to conſider how different is the fruit collected of one booke, before an other, that with the greater profit he may diſpoſe of his houres, and keep his cogitations employed, and that as bookes encreaſe, ſo may augment in him diſcretion and iudgement of reading them: that ſo he may of each of them gather ſome fruit. And certainly I admire that, ſith when we ſee avenimous beaſt we are terrified and tremble, for feare of his poyſon: how we are ſo ſenceles, as with delight to read heretical or diſſolute bookes, conſidering that they corrupt good manners, and induce to vices and vanities: which are alſo moſt ſubtill venime, wherto making the leaſt approach, it taketh ſuch roote in vs, and doth afterward

ſo budde foorth, that empoyſoning our ſoules, it becometh incurable. And which is yett worſe, we permit our ſelues eaſily to be infected, becauſe the ſcope and diſcourſe of ſuch bookes are pleaſing vnto vs, as being conformable to our appetite and to our laſciuious inclinatiō: and thus according to the cuſtome, preſenting poyſon vnder a ſweet or alluring bayte. And therfore if the ſtudious and carefull Chriſtian, deſire to obſerue any due courſe in his reading, ſith it ſo much importeth him, lett him vnderſtand, that next to the doctrine of faith, and the counſels of holy ſcripture, no other can euer ſo much aduance him to purchace vertues, and hate vices, as the frequent and ordinary reading of the conuerſation and life of the holy ſeruantes of almightie God, conſidering with all that is a natural thing, that to attempt a difficult and dangerous enterpriſe, we are therein much more induced by example then by any perſuaſions of whom ſoeuer: though we acknowledg them to be certainlie true. None could be found that would reſolue ioyfully to embrace the vertue of pouerty, humility, chaſtity, faſting, and other penitētiall labours, if he knew not that others, not only with wordes exteriourly, but really with worckes haue embraced the ſame: Neither was it for any other cauſe, that our Lord IESVS Chriſt would perſonnaly come into this world, but by example to shew vs the way of our ſaluation, and his holy wil, becauſe the examples &amp; aduertiſſementes of his faithfull ſeruantes, would not ſuffice to retire vs from our euill conuerſation and

way, and to ſetle vs in his, no not the preceptes which he had giuen in the firſt written law. But when he began to walke this way, how many were there that would accompagny him, very ſeriouſly ſeruing him euen till their death, and this only for his loue? The Church therfore knowing right well the glory that redoundeth to almightie God, and the fruit which men gather by the memory of the life of our lord IESVS Chriſt and of his ſainctes, doth euery day propoſe and ſett them before our eyes, in the diuine office, in the ſacrifices and ſolemnities, that it should not be tedious vnto vs to follow and imitate them whome we prayſe, and whoſe memory we honour, and that likewiſe we should not eſteeme it labourious to walke that way, which alone conducteth vs to eternall life. Hereof mayeſt thou conſider (deuout Reader) what vſe, almightie God maketh of his elect, in fauour of vs, becauſe we are (ſaith S. Iohn) coadiutors to the ſaluation of ſoules, we may hence alſo conceiue how greatlie we are obliged to the trueſeruantes of God, who haue ſo put themſelues to paines in the exerciſe of vertues, that they haue left the way open, that ſuch as ſeeke it may finde it, and by their examples haue taught vs which it is, and with whath force and induſtry we may attaine vnto true glory. Thoſe of former ages guided only by naturall light, did vſe exceeding diligence, to induce and animate themſelues by the examples of their famous predeceſſours, vſing them as ſo many ſpurres vnto vertrue, to the end they might in no time be defectiue in the

obligation they had both to their natiue country, and to their owne honour: and indeed the milke wher with they nourced their childrē in their publique ſchooles, was the generous actes of their anceſtours, which were red vnto them in poemes, and orations, that by meanes of thoſe examples, the children might be affected to vertue, and enflamed with deſire of glory, although it was more vaine then vertuous. This is of ſuch force, that euen at this preſent, many of our Chriſtians following the ſame practiſe, cauſe their children to spend the moſt entiere parte of their age, in committing to memory, the heroyicall actes of the ancient Grecians and Latines. But would to God that too many did not employ and waſt all their life in this ſtudy, and that many others were not more affected to Homer, Cicero and Virgil, then to IESVS Chriſt. O extreme indignity of Chriſtians.! deſeruing sharp reprehenſion and eternall punishment, in regard that they glory to be imitatours of the ſuperſtitious Gentils, who as they wanted faith, and the true light illuminating the hart of Chriſtians, ſo was not their vertue true and ſolid, but exteriour and vaine. And although that in that time of obſcure darcknes, they gaue to men ſome ſparckle of light, ſome litle knowledg of vertue, more with wordes then with effect, theſe Pagans neuertheles perſiſte in obſcurity euen in the cleare day of the true light of our lord IESVS Chriſt, the ſoueraigne truth and perfection, and are vnworthy to be honoured in compariſon of true Chriſtians, who being illuminated

with the light of faith, can eaſily diſcerne, iudge and condemne the world with his vnwiſe adherentes: becauſe as the Apoſtle S. Paul Saith, the ſpirituall man1. Cor. 20 knoweth and iudgeth al thinges: Pagans on the contrary, glorying and eſteemning themſelues wiſe with their eloquence, become ſottish and ignorant, as hauing attributed and giuen vnto creatures, that which appertayned only to the Creatour: but they whoſe cogitation and confidence is more ſetled and grounded on the diuine will and doctrine then humane, and do follow celeſtiall, not earthly Philoſophy: ſuch, I ſay shal only arriue to heauen, whence firſt diſcended their knowledge, they cannot erre, being taught by the eternall wiſdome, neither shall they euer want glory, euen amōg mortall people, though they haue with all poſſibility shunned the ſame, but shalbe illuſtrious to all the world. For though antiquity haue exceedingly honoured great ambitious perſonnes, that deſired to leaue ſome memory and renowne of themſelues in this world after their death: yet our holy mother the Church doth farre more exalt and make more glorious our Sainctes continually in the predications, feaſtes, and ſolemnities, which for them and in their honour are celebrated; beſides that we beleeue that they liue and gloriouſly raigne in heauen, in the contemplation of their Lord. So that the true ſeruantes of God are bleſſed among Angels, and honoured among men, as eminent ſainctes, as great they are, and worthy of all reuerence. Altars are euery where conſecrated, and churches

bult in their names, their images are honoured, their wordes and workes are highly commended and preached, their reliques are reuerenced and worshipped on earth, their ſoules glorified in heauen, and the miracles and excellent workes both ancient and moderne, which our lord in them, and by them hath wrought, are with exceeding great glory admired. Our Lord euen in this world recompenceth his elect, who not in appare
                  •
               e, but in effect are vertuous and holy, and incorruptedlie conſerue their faith to their Creatour. When was there euer found in any time among the ancient naturaliſtes, ſuch conſtancie, ſuch faith, temperance, magnanimity, ſweetnes, mercy, iuſtice, fortitude, and loyaulty, as hath bin found in our Chriſtians, who by no kinde of threates or faire ſpeeches of Tyrantes, could be induced, to leaue their obedience vnto God, could neuer be corrupted by any promiſe or recompence, nor haue bin inclined by any kinde of flatteries or fauours, but perſiſting firme &amp; conſtant in the truth, haue nothing eſteemed nor feared the terrible and horrible tormentes, were they neuer ſo barbarous, nor in the extremity of them, or death it ſelfe, but haue alwayes remayned immoueable and inuincible in true vertu &amp; piety, not deſiring reuenge or detriment to the perſecutours or executioners, but pardon and ſaluation, praying vnto God for them. And all this, not att their death only, but euen in their life. For there is no kinde of vertue, wherin the ſainctes haue not excelled, ſome in purity of virginity, others in continencie, with

great labour ſubiecting the flesh to the ſpirit, that euen on earth leading a life more angelical then humane, they might purchaſe eternall glory in heauen: others renouncing kingdomes, eſtates, and dignities, others diſtributing their goodes among the poore, much more highly eſteeming the piety of God, and charity to their neighbour, in a baſe and ſubmiſſiue pouerty, then any other temporall thing: to thend that being disburdened of the care of theſe tranſitory riches, they might with more eaſe, ſtudy to purchace thoſe of heauen: and in the end, for ſo much as, where they knew it to concerne the honour, glory, or ſeruice of God, they haue not ſpared to permitt their bodies to be tormented after what ſort ſoeuer: they haue bin therefore ſo pleaſing vnto his maieſtie, that he hath graunted them power to cure the diſeaſed, to caſt out deuils, to raiſe the dead, to foretell future thinges, to vnderſtand and explicate the diuine miſteries, and finally to doe ſuch thinges, as the diuine might can only doe. Lett then the eminencie of Kinges, Princes, and of all qualities of wealthy people ancient and moderne be confounded, ſith they are, and euer more haue bin vanquished and ſurmounted by vs (poore and feeble) in honour and knowledg. Lett the ſubtilty of Philoſophers be whiſt and ſilent, ſith theſe who haue trulie repoſed their faith in almightie God, shal know and finde the ſoueraigne good. I coniure thee therefore, gentle Reader, by the loue which thou oweſt

to IESVS Chriſt our Redeemer, to repreſent before the eyes of thy ſpirit, the glory and eternall riches, which the leaſt of the ſeruantes of our Redeemer IESVS Chriſt shall in the moſt bleſſed kingdome of heauen perpetually enioy: and with the ſame eyes afterward to behold all the goodes of the earth vnited together, paragonizing them with thoſe of theſe Religious, there will not ſo much as one only thought abide within thee, vntill thy hart hath quite contemned them▪ and as recordeth Cicero, if all the Empires of the earth, in compariſon of heauen and of the moone, be ſo litle that no eſteeme should be had of them, becauſe betwene them there is no proportion, how much leſſe will they appeare, being oppoſed to the Emperiall heauē, the bleſſed country of the
                  Phil. 3. elect, where according to S. Paul, our conuerſation is? It is then very reaſonable, that the life of this Saincte be ſeriouſly read, to the end to imitate him, yea before many other, ſith hereof we learne how we may pourchace the true eternall goods or riches, which according to the promiſes of God, we expect and hope for. To this end it is that our Creatour doth dayly renew and regarnish his Church, with new examples of his ſaincts, that Chriſtians becomming weake &amp; feeble, might reſume force to meritt their ſaluation, in ſeruing almightie God from the bottome of their hart. For in them is repreſented vnto vs the vertue of faith, the life of IESVS Chriſt and together with it, the imitable life of his ſainctes. He will that there be ſeculer Preiſtes, Religious

of the order of S. Hierome, S. Auguſtin, S. Benedict, S. Bernard, S. Dominick, S. Francis and others: that in them we might alwayes haue before our eyes, his life and Paſſion. Sith then ſo pious a leſſon or reading produceth ſuch fruit, thou mayeſt well perſuade thee (good Reader) how profitably shalbe employed the time, the paper, and labour, which is ſpent in writing the chronicles of them that haue bin true imitatours and repreſentations of the life of our Redeemer IESVS Chriſt. How well in like ſort their time shalbe ſpent that employ their eyes and vnderſtanding in this leſſon, not only to ſquare out a Religious life to ſuch as deſire to embrace it, but euen to learne what ought to be the life, what the comportmentes of true Chriſtians, that with their workes deſire at leaſt to appeare ſuch: by reaſon that the kingdome of heauen muſt be attayned by a combatt to

                be made, and by force of armes, which is an enterpriſe of valerous Champions or warryers: and this forcible wreſtling is not to be made againſt mortall and humane creatures, according to the Apoſtle, but againſt
                  Epheſ. 6. wicked ſpirittes, as ſubtill and malicious, as they are potent &amp; puiſſant. If thou wilt know them, thou shalt here finde their extreme audacity diſcouered, their fraudulent deluſion published, their offenſiue armors manifeſted, and their aſſaultes repulſed. If then thou be inclined to war-like exerciſe, thou shalt here obſerue moſt noble proweſſes and heroicall actes againſt the deuils, ſubdued by the champions of IESVS Chriſt: If thou takeſt

content in honours, thou shalt here ſee how highly the true freindes of God are honoured in earth and in heauen, yea and feared in hell. If thou affecteſt ſcience, of theſe thou shalt learne, the true knowledge of the fraudes and deceiptes of the world, and eſpecially true wiſdome, which is, firſt the knoledge of God, then of thy ſelfe: If thou apply thee to the actiue or contemplatiue life, thou shalt here finde a great experience of morall vertues, and of contemplations more then humane, of communion and diuine vnion: breifely if thou make profeſſion of Chriſtianity as thou oughteſt, thou shalt here clearly ſee figured in two tables, what it is to be a Chriſtian, and with what partes he ought to be qualified that maketh profeſſion therof. And that in the doctrine and in the examples of ſainctes, two thinges are neceſſary to our ſaluation: ſo that thou shalt here finde a remedy very proper and conuenient to all they deſires, and for all thy neceſſities. Now writing the life and examples of the Frier Minors the eſpeciall ſeruantes of God, by them, I meane the diſciples of the holy Father S. Francis, and of thoſe holy Fathers that did imitate him, who are the principall parties of this hiſtorie, they point out vnto vs the true rule and obſeruance of the tree inſtituted by the ſaid Father S. Francis, procuring many in theſe dayes to blush att their faultes and tranſgreſſions. Other Religious perſonnes shall in like ſorte make their benefitt hereof, ſith all Religious, touching their profeſſion, are a like, Beſides, euery other

Chriſtian may gather ſome fruit hereof, if he will beſtow the labour to receiue it, as all haue equally graces and fauours of God, by the worthy merittes of his ſainctes, Francis, Antony, &amp; others: when with them they ſtudy to ſeeke the loue of God and their neighbour. Our Fathers then deſerue prayſe and gratitude of our partes for hauing ſo well conſerued the memory of theſe glorious ſaints, with a feruent deſire to further ſoules, though they haue not laboured to publish their liues, in a lofty and polished ſtile, with a connexion of choice wordes, as the preciſe and curious would deſire; But they conſidered that the deuout Reader leauing the flowers and leaues, would only take hold of the fruit. Now to content and ſatisfie the Readers, when they shall light on ſuch thinges as are not vulgare, which they shall finde in theſe chronicles: I haue bin willing here to inſert and adde the names of the Authors, whome in this preſent hiſtory I haue principally vſed, and this for greater light and direction: who are theſe enſuyinge.

            THE PREFACE WHERIN IS DECLARED THE intention of the Holy Ghoſt in the inſtitution of the holy Order of the Frier Minors.
            
               IT is with great reaſon, that learned men writing bookes of hiſtories or doctrine for the publike good, doe ordinarily accompany them with certaine introductions, which we call proemes or prefaces, to diſcouer their intention to the Readers, which wanting they cannot haue perfect knoledge, nor reape much fruit of what they read. Though in deed, for the Readers to remayne only depriued of theſe fruites and benefittes, were a leſſe inconuenience, and in ſome ſort ſupportable, if they did not ſome times conceiue euill impreſſions, that induce them to contemne the good doctrines and profitable exāples which they read: and this proceedeth of their ignorant temerity, which cauſeth them to condemne thinges worthy of praiſe, and falſly to cenſure that which they vnderſtand not, which vice as is it reprehenſible, ſo is it detrimentall and deteſtable in all kinde of doctrine, but eſpecially in the ſacred ſcriptures and liues of ſainctes: And therfore we ſee that God, in all his worckes, would prepare men as it were by certaine proemes, that they might vnderſtand them, and expect them with ſuch intention as he meant to performe them, as when he purpoſed to renew the world, by meanes of the vniuerſall deluge, he conferred thereof with the iuſt Noe an hundred and twenty years before, commanding him the edifice of the arck, to

thend that worck might be knowne, not only to thoſe that then liued, but alſo to ſuch as should ſucceed them afterward Neither did he vpon any other conſideration deferre to giue children to the Patriarch Abraham, but that he should the better vnderſtand, and with greater reuerence receiue the grace which was figured vnto him in his ſonne Iſaac. I am of opinion that for the ſame reſpect he was forty dayes in giuing the law to the people of Iſrael, bountifully imparting vnto them many notable fauours in the meane time, and with ſuch excellent miracles deliuering them frō the ſeruitude of Egipt, that they might by theſe meanes diſpoſe thē to acknoledge him alone for God, and completely to obſerue his law. I may alſo inferre the like of the forty yeares that he entertayned that people in the deſert, that it was vnto them as it were a diſpoſition the more deerly to priſe and eſtimate the ſo much deſired land of promiſe. For this ſelfe ſame cauſe did God vſe Prophetes among his people, were it to thereaten them with punishment and chaſticementes, or to giue them hope of the benefittes and fauours which he intended vnto them, or to teach them the manner to demand and meritt his grace. And finally all the old teſtament, the ſacrifices, ceremonies, and myſteries, haue bin nothing elſe but as a certaine proeme or preface of the new, that it might be deſired and hoped, vnderſtood by them, and receiued by vs according to the true light of the holy Ghoſt, and not with a humane and fallacious ſpiritt
            Intending therfore to imitate thoſe diuine and humane examples, it ſeemed to me expedient to add a preface to this worck, that the readers might diſpoſe them to read it with a good intention, and auoid the enormous vice of ingratitude, not duely receiuing the diuine graces: and that alſo they might receiue therof a beneficiall fruit. Which I haue found ſo much more neceſſary to this worck, as the holy Ghoſt in the inſtitution of the Order of the Freer Minors, is more remote from the ordinary intention and diſcourſe of the world: for Mounting aboue the common obligation of the preceptes, he hath deſigned it to a degree of perfection

more high then the Euangelicall Councells. It is not needfull not with ſtanding, that I ſearch farre to find the proeme requiſite to diſcouer and manifeſt vnto you the intention of the holy Ghoſt and the eminencie of this Order, ſith him ſelfe ſemeth to haue diſigned it both in the old and new teſtament. We read in the prophet Ieremie, that when the Hebrew people were obſtinate in their ſinnes, and that they opened not their eares to the wordes, which on the part of the almighty, were by the Prophetes preached vnto them, God ſaid to Ieremie: Goe to the houſe of the children
                  Icrem. 35. of Rechab, and conduct them with thee to the temple, and giue them wine to drincke. Wherto Ieremie obeyed, and hauing brought the Rechabites to the temple, in to the houſe of one of the principall Officers, before him and many others, he offred them wine in cuppes or veſſels, and bid them drinck. But they anſweared him: Know Ieremie that we haue neuer drunck wine, nor will we drinck any, becauſe we haue bin forbidden it by Ionadab the ſonne of Rechab our Father, who commanded it vnto vs in theſe termes: You Rechabites ſhall neuer drincke wine, nor your children, you ſhall not build houſes, you ſhall not ſow, you ſhall not plant vignes, nor poſſeſſe any, but you ſhall dwell all your life, in tentes and pauillions that you may liue many dayes on the earth, wherin you are pilgrimes: And in this ſort doe we obſerue it, obeying that which our father hath commanded vs. The Rechabites hauing giuen this anſweare to Ieremie, he had incontinently the ſpiritt of God, that ſaid vnto him: Ieremie goe to the people of Iuda, and of Hieruſalem, and thus ſpeake vnto them O obdurate and obſtinat people, will ye neuer obey my law, and follow my commandementes? the wordes of Ionadab the ſonne of Rechab are they of more force then mine? He would that his children and their poſterity ſhould neuer drinck wine, and to obey their father, they haue not dranck any, and you would neuer obey my commandementes. I will therfore ſend you a punishment worthy of your rebellion, according as I haue threatned you: but I will not ceaſſe to fauour the Rechabites, becauſe they haue obeyd the commandements of their father. A figure doubtles moſt

expreſſe, ſo farre foorth as the ancient eſtate would permitt it, and ſo particular for the Religion of the Frier Minors of the B.Fa.S. Francis, that it hath litle need of farther expoſition then to be red and conferred with the expreſſe wordes of his rule, which are theſe. The Frier Minors haue not any thing proper, neither houſe, nor place, nor what ſoeuer other thinge, but lett them liue in this world as pilgrimes and ſtrangers, and lett them ſerue God, who hath redeemed vs in pouerty and humility and ſeeke almoſe with out shame or dishonour: conſidering that our lord Ieſus-Chriſt would be poore for vs. Now by the liuely example of this Order, and by the ſo great auſterities and ſtrict obſeruations; our lord reprehendeth the frenſie and folly of the Chriſtians; who forgetfull of the pouerty of our Redeemer Ieſus-Chriſt, and of his ſeruantes, doe ruine themſelues by auarice, by delicacies and diſſolutions. We hope that God will neuer permitt vs to want perfect Religious of this Order, that shall admonish vs of our duety by their example, before the eyes of his diuine Maieſtie.
            But S.Iohn the Euangeliſt and Prophett in his reuelations doth more particulerly demonſtrate the time and eſtate of the glorious Fa. S. Francis and his holy diſciples, ſaying: And I ſaw, when the Angel had opened the ſixt ſeale, there was made a great earthquake, and the ſunne became black as it were ſackcloth of haire: (which is a garment made of the haire of a horſe and of very groſſe woll) and the whole moone became as bloud: and the ſtarres frō heauen fell vpon the earth. After theſe thinges I ſaw foure Angels ſtanding vpon the four corners of the earth, holding the four windes of the earth that they should not blow vpon the land, nor vpon the ſea, nor on any tree. And I ſaw an other Angell aſcending from the riſing of the ſunne, hauing the ſigne of the liuing God: and he cryed with a loud voice to the foure Angels to whome it was giuen to hurt the earth and the ſea, ſaying, hurt not the earth and the ſea, nor the trees, till we ſigne the ſeruantes of our lord in their foreheades. This Propheſie occording to the teſtimony of Vbertinus, was preached by S. Bonauenture att Paris in a Prouinciall chapter, as already verified in the Perſon of the holy

Father S. Francis, adding that he was by diuine reuelation aſſured, that S. Iohn the Euangeliſt in this paſſadge, had his eye on S Francis, and on his ſacred Religion. The ſame is affirmed by Brother Iohn of Parma, who was a right holy and Religious man, and famous by many miracles that God wrought by him.
            But for the more eaſie intelligence hereof, it muſt be vnderſtood that by the ſeauen viſions of S. Iohn in his Apocalipſe, are ſignified the ſeauen ages or eſtates of the Church. The firſt age was, of the foundation therof, made by our Lord IESVS Chriſt and his Apoſtles in Iurie which began at his preaching, and continued till the Martyrdome of the Apoſtles. This was figured by the firſt viſion of the ſeauen Churches, in the firſt and ſecond chapter. The ſecond age was of the confirmation of the faith, with the bloud of the martyrs shed thorough all the world by Pagans and Idolators, which began att the perſecution of Nero, figured by the ſecond viſion of ſeauē ſeales, in the 5. chapter. The third age was doctrine, in the ſame being declared the myſteries of our faith, and all hereſies clearlie refuted. It began in the time of the Emperour Conſtantin, who aſſembled the Councell of Nice, againſt the hereſie of Arius, figured by the third viſion of the ſeauen trompettes, in the ſeauenth chapter. The fourth age was ſolitary and Eremeticall life, performed with long and great auſteritie of life and contemplation of ſpiritt, till the time of S. Antony, figured in the fourth viſion of the woman clothed with the ſunne, in the twelueth chapter. The fift age was when the holy Church began to abound in temporall riches, as well Religious as Clearkes, it began in the time of Charles the great, figured by the fiſt viſion of the ſeauen golden veſſels, in the fifteenth chapter. The ſixt age of the renouation of Euangelicall life, is of the warre againſt the ſectes of Antechriſt, performed by the voluntary poore, who poſſeſſe not any thing in this life, it began in the Seraphicall Father S Francis, author and inſtitutor of the Frier Minors, figured by the ſixt viſion of the abhominable and puiſſante woman of Babilon, in the ſeauenteenth chapter. The ſeauenth age shalbe hereafter, both in a merueillous repoſe, and participation of warre, which is to come

in earth, and shall shortly come in perfection in the generall reſurrection of all the ſainctes of God: it shall haue his begymning in death before the comming of our Redeemer IESVS Chriſt to iudge, it is figured in the twentith chapter of the Apocalypſe, when the dragon shall finally be condemned, and the elect glorified.
            So that in the firſt age did florish the perfection of Prelacie and the Paſtorall care of the Church, thoſe were the holy Apoſtles. In the ſecond floriſhed the eſtate of Martyrdome, by the combatt and triumph of the Champions of IESVS Chriſt. In the third floriſhed the Voice of Preachers and Doctours, the trompett of the diuine wiſdome. In the fourth the ſanctity and ornament of contemplatiue life, in thoſe that liued and led an Euangelicall and celeſtiall life on earth. In the fift floriſhhed the zeale of iuſtice, by which one diſcendeth to a commune and leſſe perfect life in the zealous &amp; iuſt inſtitutors of Reguler eſtates. In the ſixt florished the eſtate of the imitation of IESVS Chriſt, reformed by the Church in the true imitators of Euangelicall life. In the ſeauenth afterward shall floriſh the taſt and ſwetnes of the glory which God ſhall communicate vnto his elect, for the wearyſome, labours which one shall haue voluntarily and affectionatly ſuffered here on earth, as farre foorth as humane infirmity, ſhall haue ability to ſupport, and God shalbe pleaſed to inſpire into vs. And our Lord hath ordayned theſe eſtates and theſe ages, according to the neceſſities of the holy Church againſt his ennemies the diuels, and againſt wicked men their followers, who together maintaine ancient warre againſt his Church, though tolerated by God for the greater glory of the elect: for none shalbe crowned but he that couragiouſly combatteth. So was the firſt eſtate againſt the carnall, and groſſe intelligences &amp; ceremonies of the Iewes. The ſecond againſt the idolatry of the Pagans. The third againſt the Arrians and other heretikes. The fourth againſt the carnall and deteſtable ſect of Mahomet. The fift againſt the life of looſe Chriſtians dishonoring thēſelues. The ſixt againſt the peſtiferous poyſon of Antechriſt. The ſeauenth againſt the army of deuils and their ſectatours, who in theſe latter dayes shall trouble the Church more then euer. We ought neuertheles

to conceiue, that though the ſaid eſtates be thus ſeparated, and each one haue his particuler property, yet the one participating of the quality and property of the other, they come in a certaine manner to entermingle together: by reaſon that there euer haue bin, and shalbe in the Church of God, Prelates, Martyrs, &amp; Confeſſors, all affectionate and perfect imitatours of IESVS Chriſt. It is a matter well worthy exceeding deepe conſideration to weigh with what profound wiſdome, theſe Eſtates haue bin ordained by the holy Ghoſt.
            Firſt our Lord IESVS Chriſt, as cheife and foundamental ſtone of his Church, together with his glorious Mother, his Apoſtles and primitiue Church, conſtituted and founded the firſt eſtate; out of which was afterwardes to iſſue all perfection in the enſuying Eſtates. In which aroſe the firſt battell, our Redeemer IESVS Chriſt, oppoſing againſt the ingratefull Sinagogue, poſſeſſed of the deuill, wherein as our Capitaine he entred the field of combatt for vs and fighting valerouſly, gott a glorious victory, leauing to the world a new manner of fight, to vanquish our ennemies, and to attaine an eternall and immortal glory in heauen: and as he was true God and Lord of all, it was expedient, that, to the confuſion of the ingrateful Sinagogue, and for the greater manifeſtation of his omnipotencie, and clemencie, by meane of his Apoſtles preaching, he should be knowne to be the true Redeemer and Lord of all the world and of all nations. But whereas they were all Idolators, and addicted to moſt abhominable vices, by perſuaſion of the deuils, whome they ſerued, the valliant combat of the champions of IESVS Chriſt was neceſſary (I meane the holy Martyres) to bring idolatry and infernall vices to ruine. Att the end of which conflict the world was to acknoledge IESVS Chriſt, as it began to doe vnder the Empire of Cōſtantin, when it pleaſed God, to giue ſome peace and repoſe to his Church. And becauſe a more cleare knoledge of the faith of the moſt ſacred Trinity, and of the diuinity and humanity of IESVS Chriſt was expedient, the order and dignity of Doctours, illuminated by the holy Ghoſt, did then florish. In like ſort alſo, becauſe our ſpirittes cannot arriue to the depth of the

myſteries of faith, and that many preſume ouer much on the ſubtilitye and force of their witte, many (particulerly of the Grecians) did by diuine permiſſion iuſtly fall into errour, therfore the want and neceſſity of Doctours did grow and encreaſe, who obtayned glorious victories ouer the heretikes. And becauſe the knoledge of diuine thinges, doth litle or nothing auaile, if the life be not conformable to the doctrine, in the fourth eſtate which was litle different in time from the third of the Doctours, did floriſh that merueillous, celeſtiall and angelical life, of Hermites in the deſerts ſpecially of Arabia, Paleſtine and Egypt, very commodious and conuenient places, where, with great abſtinence, watchinges, prayers, diſclplines, contemplations, and other pious exerciſes, they did ſubiect the flesh to the ſpiritt, which they held perfectly vnited with God. But by reaſon that the malice and infirmity of humane nature cannot long ſupport and endure ſuch a ſublimity and excellencie of life: and conſidering that the fall from ſo emin
                  •
               t an eſtate draweth together with it a conſequence of enormous ſinnes, a coldnes of the loue of God, and ſometimes Apoſtaſie: the ſame ſucceded, together with hereſies that branched out, ſo that there was yet need of violent chaſticementes. And therfore were the Chriſtians sharpely afflicted and chaſticed, by no leſſe cruell then barbarous nations, ſuch as were the Hungarians, Gothes, Vandales, Lombardes and other, yea we yet ſee the order and abhominable ſect of the barbarous Mahomet, by reaſon of falſe Chriſtians and heretikes, to ruine, bring to ſeruitude and ſclauery a great part of the Chriſtian Prouinces. This was the fourth warre wherby, in regard of the extreme coldnes of the deuotion of Chriſtians, the Church was greiuouſly afflicted. Yet did not God therfore leaue his Church deſtitute of holy perſonnages, vnder whome in ſo miſerable a time, she was ſupported, as in the dialogues of S. Gregory doth manifeſtly appeare.
            Now our Lord IESVS Chriſt defending his Church, he aſſembled and retired the pureſt and moſt entier part therof, into this part of the world which we call Europe, in the time of Charles the Emperour &amp; king of France, by whoſe meane God ſecured, &amp;

ſetled in tranquility the eſtate of his Vicar att Rome, the capitall citty of the Empire, and gaue peace to the Church, the ſaid Emperour attempting great enterpriſes, and obtayning glorious victories ouer the Barbarians, Pagans, and Sarrazins. In that fift eſtate, humane infirmity was with very great reaſon condiſcended vnto, and to that effect was inſtituted a more lardge &amp; tollerable life, to th'end that ſuch as were not capable of the hight of Martyrdome, or of contemplation, might neuertheles finde place of fauour with God, in a meane or indifferent eſtate, eccleſiaſticall perſons poſſeſſing their temporall goodes peaceably as did the ſeculers: And becauſe many could not, euen in that meane eſtate, ſo ſtrictly containe themſelues as to liue vertuouſly according to their duety, God rayſed againſt them holy men and zealous of his honour, that should reprehend and check their vices and diſſolutions: which cauſed them to raiſe rebellion and perſecution euen againſt their owne Prelates, and ſo Chriſtians abuſing the benefitt of peace and temporall proſperity, the Eccleſiaſticall no leſſe then the ſeculers, looſed the reines to infinite vices, as to auarice, ſimonie, vſury, violence, diſcord, and adultery, without any remorſe of conſcience or feare of God: ſo that retayning as it were the only name and faith of Chriſtians, they in other reſpectes liued meerly as Pagans. This carnall and licencious life tooke ſuch roote, that all memory of ſpirituall life and the imitation of the life of IESVS Chriſt ſeemed to be vtterly extinguished and raced out of mennes hartes, and therfore it was expedient for him to reforme the Church by renewing the memory of his moſt ſacred life. It ought not to ſeeme ſtrange not with ſtanding, that the diuine prouidence which ſweetly and prudently gouerneth al thinges, would graunt to his Church, eſtates and temporall riches: for the ſame hath bin expedient for diuers conſiderations, and principally to demonſtrate that IESVS Chriſt is the almighty Creator and Gouernour of all, that to him all creatures owe ſeruice, &amp; that with all thinges &amp; of all, he may be ſerued in his Church, againſt the hereſie of the Manicheans: beſides, it is to make appeare, that the new teſtament doth not reproue the eſtate and quality of Princes,

nobles, and riche perſonnes, though himſelfe being in the world, did chooſe an eſtate of life in pouerty, croſſes, and humility.
            Thirdly he would that Eccleſiaſticall Prelates should poſſeſſe titles of honour, dignities and temporall richeſſe, that the potent of the world might learne of them the manner to humble themſelues, to be liberall, gracious and affable to their ſubiectes, to execute iuſtice exactly towardes the guilty, &amp; ſometimes to shew mercy: to th'end alſo that the rich might learne not to employ their goodes in worldly and tranſitory vanities, nor much leſſe in pleaſures and contentmentes of the fleſh, but to beſtow them in charitable vſes of piety, of mercy, and of a moderate and temperate life: for of all this, did the Prelates of that time, by their exceeding charity, abſtinence and liberality, giue a right worthy example, diſtributing the patrimony of IESVS Chriſt, among his poore.
            Fourthly, that the imitation of the life of IESVS Chriſt, might be better knowne and more readily embraced in pouerty, croſſes and contempt of all tranſitory thinges, men hauing by experience ſeene, how many euils and ſinnes ſucceeded in his Church, by meane of honours and temporall richeſſe, and that euen the blinded worldlinges might be aſſured that the ſtate of life which himſelfe did chooſe in this life▪ is moſt ſecure and moſt perfect. Fiftly, and finally, to condiſcend vnto the imperfection and infirmity of many, that being incapable of the excellent and Apoſtolique pouerty, wrought their ſaluation by this more large way: whence may be conceiued that God hath alwayes ordeyned the eſtate of his Church, according as he knew it moſt expedient for his elect, ſo that wheras the Church hath bin enriched with temporalities it was by the moſt prudent counſaile of the holy Ghoſt. This magnificence of richeſſe and temporall eſtate, auaileth much for triall of Prelates and Eccleſiaſticall perſonnes, for by the ſame appeareth whither they be humble in honours, temperate in abondance, and amiddeſt their flowing ſubſtance, poore in regard of their will. But alas! few by this triall haue proued

ſuch: for contrarie wiſe they haue become licencious, and haue conuerted that into intollerable tranſgreſſion, which was giuen vnto them for inducement to exerciſe themſelues in all piety and vertue.
            Now this fall, towardes the end of this latter age and eſtate of temporall proſperity, is merueillous punctually declared by S. Iohn in the fift chapter of his viſions, where he introduceth the Angell ſpeaking to the fift Church of Sardis: Thou art eſteemed to liue, but thou art dead. Then by way of threates he ſaith, that in regard of the great euels and litle good which she did, if she did not amend, she should in short time be punished and damned. And in the opening of the fift ſeale, it is ſaid, that the ſainctes out of great zeale required vengeance on ſinners: and att the ſound of the fift trompett it is ſaid, that a ſtarre (therby being vnderſtood the principall of the eſtate of the Church, ſeculers and eccleſiaſticals) fell as vpon the earth with ſo greedy a deſire of terreſtriall thinges, that the pittes of the bottomles depth did open, as if he would ſay, all kinde of ſinnes and vices (as are pride, auarice, cruelty, murders, and other infinite enormities) did, by their euill example, ouerflow the earth: and vpon that occaſion, the name of God hath bin from that time blaſphemed, and many hereſies haue thence ſucceded, and likewiſe warre betweene kingdomes and peoples one againſt an other, ſchiſmes and diſcorde among Prelates one againſt another, and betwene Prelates and their ſubiectes, and all this to the great ſcandall of Chriſtians, which did ſo much exceed the other precedent diſaſters, in regard that it was domeſticall proceeding of the cheefe ſpirituall and temporall perſonnes of the Church.
            In the dregges of this fift age, was all the Empire of Federic the ſecond, a violent perſecuter of the Church and of the Prelates, in ſo much that he brought the Sarrazins into Italy, and there planted them, who by their incurſions committed a great murder of the Chriſtians, ſaccagementes, ruines, and burninges of Churches and monaſteries, to ſatiate their barbarous infidelity. The ſunne was then obſcured,

to witt our holy Father the Pope, who was depriued of the reuerence from each one due vnto him, and the moone became bloudy by the perſecutions, impriſonmentes, &amp; death of the Cardinals and Prelates, that were ſo much afflicted by the ſaid Emperour Federic, and his adherentes. And the ſtarres fell from heauen, that is, many eccleſiaſticall perſonnes, betraying the Church of IESVS Chriſt, adhered to the Emperour. The deuils therefore, miniſters of the wrath of God, made readie themſelues to reuenge ſuch and ſo many enormities ouer the world, in all the foure partes of the earth, and to this purpoſe they induced men to vnwonted ſinnes, labouring to preuent with punishment the diuine mercy: &amp; doubtles if our Lord IESVS Chriſt had not fauoured his Church, by a new byrth and reformation of ſpirit, she could not haue auoyded an horrible chaſticement. God omitted not to reueale, to his vicares on earth, and to many faithfull Catholiques, for their conſolation, this neceſſity, and the remedy he intended to the ſame. He manifeſted inviſion to Pope Innocent the third, the Church of S. Iohn Lateran as ready to fall, but that it was ſupported and ſuſteyned by the shoulders of two poore men. So when afterwardes the glorious Father S. Francis, and after him S. Dominick came to demanded permiſſion of the ſaid Pope to inſtitute their Orders in the Church, he knew by illumination of the holy Ghoſt, that they were the two poore men whome he had ſeene in his dreame or viſion, ſupporting the ſaid Church: and therfore was he the more eaſily induced to accord their requeſtes. So that the Church was att that time filled with brutish people, that were all ſclaues to their concupiſcences, and as terreſtiall ſerpents, full of auarice, and with other cruell and horrible monſters, hauing their face and conuerſation vtterly deformed &amp; corrupted, with infinite vices: but particulerly with hypocriſie and hereſie which then raigned.
            Albeit that God as iealous of the honour of his Eſpouſe, was exceedingly moued and offended att ſo many enormities, yet did he not therfore in his greateſt fury, omitt to shew his mercie: for in the middes of his Church he rayſed the Orders of begging

Friers, flowing with men of famous ſanctity, that should roote out auarice, banish allurements and carnall pleaſures, reiect honours and terreſtriall dignities, shame hipocriſie, defend truth, ſtirre vp the fire of charity, reforme other peruerſe habitudes, and imitating and following the exampe of IESVS CHRIST, should boldy reprehend the euill deportements and abuſe of ſome in the Church, should by the word of God awaken &amp; induce the people to pennance, should with admirable vertue confound the malice and great errours of miſcheuous heretikes, and by their inſtant and ſeruent prayers, should appeaſe the iuſt wrath of God. Among whome as it were being figured by Enoch and Elias, S. Francis and S. Dominick particulerly, were ordayned and deputed to this employment. And as S. Antonine in his hiſtory recounteth, the holy Father S. Dominick in ſpiritt ſaw God exceedingly moued againſt the world, which he intended to punish. But, that the glorious Virgin demaunded pardon for the Church, preſenting vnto him two men, who by the diuine prouidence were already deputed to preach pennance to ſinners, to moue them to amendement, which were the glorious Father S. Francis and S. Dominick, by whoſe prayers God was appeaſed: and it happened afterward, that theſe holy Fathers entring into the Church of S. Peter att Rome, did in ſpirit know one an other to be Brothers and companions, deſigned to this affaire: wherefore in great charity they mutually embraced one an other.
            Theſe two origines and inſtitutors of two perfect rules in the Church of IESVS CHRIST, were, to witt S. Dominick, as a cleare Cherubim, that with the reſplendent light of wiſdome, and predications, ſpred the winges of his doctrine ouer cloudy obſcurities of the world, which by this his ſo great ſplendour, did giue light and diſcouer the errours of heretikes, and conducted the hartes of the faithfull in the ſecure way of true peace. And the bleſſed S. Francis, as an other Seraphim, aſcending out of the eaſt, purged with that kindled fiery coale, IESVS-CHRIST crucified, and entierly enflamed with the feruour of heauenly loue, he ſcattered this diuine fire ouer the world,

both the one and the other leauing to their beloued diſciples, the ſaid Properties, though in each of them, and in certaine of their perfect and legitimate iſſue, the ſplendour of ſcience, and the feruour of charity, were merueilous well connexed together. But by reaſon that all the euils of that time proceeded of the vnbridled greedines &amp; abondance of temporall ſubſtance, and with all, that men did employ and glutt themſelues in vanities, and in loathſome ſenſualities: the holy Father S. Francis touched with the holy Ghoſt, would cutt off euen by the very roote, and farr remoue from himſelfe and his Order all temporall richeſſe, as a reformer of this fift age, and as one whom the holy Ghoſt had deputed to beginne the ſixt age and the ſixt eſtate of the Church, propoſing to the eyes of all Chriſtians, the life of IESVS CHRIST crucified, not written or read in paper, but engrauen by the induſtriou
                  •
                labour of theſe perfect imitatours: as far foorth as humane infirmity could imitate the ſame. It may in verity be affirmed, that S. Francis was formed of God, as the firſt man, who after the firſt fiue dayes of his workes, was with a mature counſaile made the ſixt after his image and ſimilitude: ſo likewiſe IESVS-CHRIST in the ſixt age of his Church formed S. Francis, according to his image, and in ſimilitude of his life and croſſe, in as much as humaine fragility did permitt And this was done for a new augmentation of his elect. He was likewiſe figured by the Angell, of whome we haue formerly ſpoaken, that he cryed with a loud voice vnto the foure Angels, to whome was commanded to hurt the land and the ſea, in theſe wordes: Doe not any hurt, till we haue ſigned the ſeruantes of God in the forehead: that is, till we haue raced out the accurſed ſignes and characters of the beaſt, which are the vices and ſinnes of men, and haue imprinted, not only in their hartes by penance, but euen in their liues, the ſignes of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, which is the holy Croſſe, the true ſigne of the elect: which office is conueniently applied vnto S Francis, as to him that carryed the title, ſeale, and figure of the life and paſſion of our Lord IESVS-CHRIST, as well in following the ſteppes of

his conuerſation in the hight of contemplation, as in excellent and miraculous workes, as alſo in the ſinguler priuiledge of the communication of his moſt ſacred ſtigmates.
            Who can euer explicate or conceiue, with what reſemblance the holy Ghoſt in the life of this holy man, hath repreſented vnto the Church, the life, croſſe, humility, and perfection, wherein our Lord IESVS CHRIST ought to be imitated? And it was doubtles expedient for the great neceſſities of the Church. When our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST came (as S. Auguſtin ſaith) the world was in extreme neceſſity, it is therfore very reaſonable that we yeld him infinite thankes, he hauing releiued vs againſt ſo many diſaſters. But who is he, I pray you, that had not bin ruyned and ouer whelmed by the violent torrent of the malice and ſinnes of the world, if the croſſe of our Lord IESVS-CHRIST, and his diuine aucthority had not with ſuch burning feruour bin preached in the middes of the world? for we now relying there vpon, are firme in God, and ſecure againſt the violence of malice and enormitie. The eſtate of the world was ſo wretched and miſerable, that there was need of a diuine redreſſe, by whoſe aucthority man might be induced to voluntary pouerty, to continence, charity, iuſtice, concord, and true piety, with all other excellent vertues, which are the way to eternall ſaluation, and the end of Chriſtian profeſſion. It ſeemed then that in the fift age, the world was retourned in manner to the like neceſſity, as it was in before the comming of IESVS-CHRIST, ſo deeply had it buried in forgetfulnes the good which he had procured it: for it did againe wallow in his former ancient iniquities, in ſuch ſort that the charity of God was as it were conſtrained to be once againe crucified before the eyes of ingratefull men, who ſeemed to haue forgotten that incomprehenſible benefitt, not for the Redemption of ſinnes, for his paſſion ſufficied for infinite worldes, but to renew in the memory of men, the way to heauen, which is no other then the croſſe and paſſion. And it not being expedient to reiterate the ſame, becauſe IESVS CHRIST, as glorious and immortall, is no more capable of death, his diuine wiſdome found this meane, liuely and effectually

to repreſent in his ſeruant, the ſtandard of the croſſe, his paſſion, and his woundes, to renew them in the memory of men, that they might follow the perfection of the Euangelicall eſtate, which himſelfe by his moſt holy life had taught vs.
            This ſeruant elected for ſo great a myſtery, was the glorious Father S. Francis, in ſuch neceſſity deputed to make a ſpirituall renouation in the world, of the life of IESVS-CHRIST, repreſented to the eies of the faithfull in his perſon, and in the perfect Religious of his Order. And in regard that the life of IESVS CHRIST and his perfection doth particulerly shine, as the ghoſpell teacheth vs, in the paſſion and the croſſe, that is in moſt profound humility, in moſt ſtrict pouerty without any mixture of temporall ſubſtance, in feruour of charity and compaſſion of ſinners, in worckes of our ſaluation, auſtere and difficult, but eſpecially in interiour perfection of charity, wherwith our Lord IESVS-CHRIST, our head conioyneth and vniteth vs with God: and for better perfomance of this vnion, he counſaileth vs the renunciation of temporall richeſſe, and the abdication of proper libertie and ſenſualities. The holy Father S. Francis walked this way of the Counſailes of IESVS-CHRIST, ill vnderſtood of the world, and inſtituted a rule and direct path tending to perfection and to vnion with God, wherein walking himſelfe, and teaching more by effect then by wordes, he shewed to the world the true way of penance and ſaluation.
            According therfore to the opinion of S. Bonauenture, may be obſerued three merueillous effectes, wherfore God ſent S. Francis into this world. The firſt was, to preach penance, as an other forerunner of IESVS-CHRIST, in the deſert of pouerty, becauſe Chriſtians had already forgotten it, and therfore he inſinuated vnto them the neceſſity they had therof, by reaſon of the blindnes that their enormous ſinnes had procured thē. The firſt name alſo that this holy Religion had, was Preachers of penance, which title and miniſtery was giuen them by Pope Innocent the third, in the firſt confirmation of the Order: therfore was it that S. Francis did inſtitute the third Order, called of Penitents. The ſecond

matter he was to be employed in by the holy Ghoſt, was, for himſelfe and his diſciples by profeſſion and rule to renouate the Euangelicall life and perfection, the which to effectuate he inſtituted with the ſpirit of IESVS CHRIST, and ordeyned the rule of the Frier Minors, which he being deſirous to found with exceeding deepe foundations of humility, he would that his Brethren should be called Minors, that is the leaſt of all other. Many holy Fathers haue florished in this Order, who haue bin glorious in ſanctity &amp; doctrine, as S. Antony, S. Bonauenture, S. Lewis the bishop, S. Benardine, and many other Confeſſours and Martyrs of IESVS-CHRIST. S. Francis did alſo inſtitute the Apoſtolicall rule and life of S. Clare and hir Diſciples, who by their ſanctity and example, drew an innumerable multitude of Virgins that eſpouſed thēſelues to IESVS-CHRIST. Finally the third thing that this Seraphicall ſainct was to attempt, was to teach all faithfull Chriſtians, voluntarily to take vp and carry on their shoulders the croſſe of our Sauiour IESVS-CHRIST, demonſtrating vnto them that with pouerty and the croſſe, they should gaine and gett poſſeſſion of true incorruptible richeſſe, and with labour should attaine true repoſe that with humility is gotten true glory, and with the familiarity and frequent communication which is had with our Lord IESVS-CHRIST, is purchaced his loue and amity. The ſtigmates alſo and woundes of our Redeemer were imprinted in this glorious S. Francis, not only in his ſoule, but euen viſibly in his body, that the carnall might haue no excuſe of not following IESVS CHRIST crucified in his ſeruant Francis. Now out of theſe obligations which this holy Father had, as out of a new ſpiritt of IESVS CHRIST there proceeded in him that nouelty of ſo merueillous worckes, in all ſortes of vertues, as thoſe exceſſes of humility &amp; contempt of himſelfe, the auſterity of diſcipline, wherwith he afflicted his body, the great feruour he had of the ſaluation of his neighbour, wherby he entierly employed both himſelfe and his to reforme Chriſtians, &amp; to reduce them into the way of obedience vnto God &amp; his law. Theſe things are vnderſtood of few, &amp; alſo of few priſed according to their worth, by reaſon that they ſeeme cō
               temptible

to earthly eyes, yea mē shunne &amp; ieſt at thē, becauſe the ſenſual mā guided only by natural light, cōceiueth not the thinges that are of God. The deuout Chriſtian then, ought now to demaund humbly of this ſoueraigne God, as of the author of this worck, the light of his grace, wherby being freed of humane iudmentes and conceiptes, he may vnderſtand, taſt, and gather the1. Col. 2. fruit of the ſpiritt of IESVS CHRIST, ſo bcuntifully communicated to S. Francis &amp; to his true children, for the reformatiō, aſſiſtance, and comfort of his elect, and of all true Chriſtians.

                     THE grace of our Sauiour IESVS-CHRIST hath appeared vnto vs, in theſe later dayes particulerly in his ſeruant Francis, to whome the Father, of mercy and light, would by his benignity impart ſuch benedictions, and ſo excellent fauours, that, as by the diſcourſe of his life appeareth, he did not only draw him out of the darckenes of the world, to ſetle him in the true light, but he made him great, in the merites of the perfection of all vertues. And hauing extraordinarily communicated vnto him many note-worthy myſteries of the croſſe, he merueillously eleuated and exalted him in his holy Church, wherin he gaue him a right eminent place andThe birth of S. Francis. degree. This great ſeruant of God Francis, was borne the yeare of grace 1182, in the citty of Aſsiſsium, ſcituate in the valley of Spoletum in Italy. His Father was a rich Marchant, of an honeſt familie, called

Mariconi: his name was Peter Bernardone, taking for his name the proper name of his father the grand father of the ſaid Francis, called Bernardone de Mariconi: his mother was called Pica, who was a very pious &amp; honeſt woman, who procured him in his baptiſme to be called Iohn, but his Father afterward att his Confirmation, would that he ſhould chaung his name, and was called Francis. Some affirme that he was called Francis, becauſe he had with exceeding facility learned the French tongue. Before his birth, his mother endured very much being many dayes in labour of deliuery, in meane while there came a poore pilgrime to the doore of the houſe, who hauing receiued an almoſe, ſaid to him that brought it; cauſe that woman who endureth ſuch throwes of trauaile, to be carryed into a ſtable, and ſhe ſhalbe incontinently deliuered.He was borne in a ſtable. Which being done, ſhe was inſtantly deliuered, and for that reſpect there was built in that place a chappell, where in memory of the birth of this S. the hiſtory of this miracle was depeinted: whome our Lord IESVSCHRIST would in regard of his birth in a poore and contemptible place, make like vnto himſelfe. This chappell is now called S. Francis the litle. Francis was nourtured and educated of his parentes, as theirS. Francis his youth. eldeſt ſonne. And hauing in ſhort time learned the French tongue, though it be very difficult, they putt him to learne Latin, as moſt vniuerſall in ail Europe (for to merchantes it is of no ſmall importance to know many tongues) which hauing learned, and being of age capable to manadge affaires, he trayned him to his trafique, both in his citty and abroad. And though he where buſyed and employed in the vanities and folies of the world, yet was it not poſsible for the deuill to corrupt his good and naturall inclination, which God (who had ſowed the ſame in him as in a good groūd) did alwayes conſerue in his hart. And therfore, albeit in his youth he haunted and conuerſed with his equals, and with them did honeſtly ſpend his time in diuers recreations; yet did he neuer permitt his pleaſure ſo much to preuaile, but that as an other Ioſeph, he moſt carefully preſerued the ineſtimable treaſure of his chaſtity. Yea negotiating with merchants, for the moſt part true miniſters of auarice, yet had he not for all that, ſo ſett vp his reſt and deſire on tranſitory ri cheſſe and ſiluer, as that thy could hinder him from the exerciſe of the vertues of mercy towardes the poore, to whom he alwayes ſhewed aWhat a great almoſe-giuer he was. natural inclination &amp; compaſsion to aſsiſt &amp; releiue them; which was a particuler grace, that God had giuen him, as an infallible note that he was of his eſpeciall elect; which augmenting and growing in him euen from his tender yonth, made him ſo milde and mercifull, that he could not deny the poore any thinge they demaunded him, particulerly when

the party in neceſsity did mention in his requeſt the loue of God. Notwithſtanding it one day chaunced that being earneſtly employed, he could not attend to giue an almoſe to a poore man that demaunded it for the loue of God. His buſines being ended, this true ſeruant of God, calling to minde that he had denyed a poore man, he ſharply checked and reprehended himſelfe, titling himſelfe, ill nourtured, diſcurteous, inhumane and cruell, ſaying that if a freind, or an other man of honour had ſent to aske him any thinge, he ſhould haue neglected and layd aſide all buſines to giue him content and ſeruice; and yet he had not done ſo in Godds cauſe; and therfore he haſtened to finde out that poore man, to whome hauing giuen an almoſe, he asked him pardon. And to the end he might not thenceforward proue forgetfull in the like accident, he againe confirmed his vow, that as farre foorth as ſhould be poſsible vnto him, he would neuer deny that which ſhould be demanded him for the loue of God; and perſeuering euen till death in this vow, he continually encreaſed in diuine graces: wherupon he aſfirmed, that being ſeculer, he neuer heard word of the loue of God vttered, but that it molified and moued his hart. Francis then being yet yong &amp; worldly, was mindefull of God in this ſort, wherin many that eſteeme themſelues good Chriſtians and very ſpiritual doe not any way remember him, conſidering that often times for a litle almoſe demanded of them by a poore creature, they feele interiourly an anxiety therof, and doe with choller diſdaynfully reiect him. This was the A. B. C. wherin S. Francis exerciſed himſelfe, with the greateſt of the houſe of God, and therfore he merited to obtaine of his diuine maieſty, mercy and fauour; for in that reſpect are the mercifull called bleſſed. So was he naturally liberall, remote from auarice, perhappes more then he ought, doeing itThe good nature of S. Francis. to be eſteemed and honoured. Therfore did the yong men of his eſtate much affect and honour him, and in their ſportes and recreations did ordinairily make him their capitaine, becauſe he did voluntarily and freely ſpend in muſique, bankets, garmentes and other youthfull folies. But one day conſidering theſe vanities, he thus diſcourſed, with himſelfe: Sith thou art ſo free and liberall towardes men, of whome thou canſt expect no other recompence but a litle vaine glory, how much more reaſonable were it for thee to ſhew this liberality towardes God in his poore people, to whome that which thou poſſeſſeſt doth appertaine, &amp; who doth afterward ſo bountifully and abondantly accept and recompence the ſame? In this ſort mouing himſelfe, he thenceforward employed in almoſe and other charities, as much or more then in vanities. Francis had beſides, a naturall ſweetnes in his conuerſations accōpanied

with ſuch a benignite and patience, as made him gratefull and amiable to each one: by reaſon that his good partes and conditionsPredictiō of his ſanctitie. gaue hope of ſome worthy matter in him. There was then in Aſsiſium, a very ſimple man but eſteemed to be inſpired of God, who meeting the yong man Francis, did alwayes caſt his cloake on the ground and ſpread it where he was to paſſe, ſaying before all the world: It hath bin thus ordayned: as if he would ſay of God, that the yong Francis is worthy of all honour and reuerence.
                  
                     He was priſoner. There being continuall warre betweene the citty of Aſsiſium and Peruſia, he was one day with many other of his fellow-cittizens taken priſoner by the enemies, and they were all conducted to Peruſia, where they remained priſoners for a yeare, till the citties were att accorde. In this his impriſonmēt he ſhewed a right worthy proofe of his magnanimity, being amiddes ſo many afflictions and diſcomfortes, ſo conſtant, temperat, and merry, that his companions did admire theratt, and often reprehended him for it: but he with alacrity anſweared them: What thinck ye, you my companions? What countenance would you haue me to carry? Tell me I pray you, if we haue cauſe of ſorrow, ſith we ſhall in this reſpect from henceforward be more honoured of the world. Thus did he comfort and encourage them all in the priſon, and euen ſerued them; for the ſeruant which they had, being expulſed as ſeditious, he voluntarily ſerued them in euery thinge, and was vnto them a greatfull companion. By reaſon of theſe acceptable diſpoſitions, his conuerſation and accointance was deſired and ſought of euery one, and by this meane he was in manner conſtrained to doe many vaine thinges that were litle pleaſing vnto him. So did he very vnprofitably conſume and waſt his age and time, his goods and graces of nature, till about the fiue and twentith yeare of his age, though God had endued him with ſo many prerogatiues and rare conditions, not to abuſe them, but to employ them entierly in the praiſe and glory of his diuine maieſty: for though he did alwayes keep and preſerue aliue this ſparckle of the loue of God in his hart, yet did not the youthfull Francis (as being ouer much poſſeſſed with a care to augment and conſerue his wealth, and to enioy his recreations) vnderſtand the celeſtiall ſecrett of his great and diuine vocation, which was, with reiection of earthly conuerſations, to employ himſelfe meerly to contemplation of celeſtiall thinges, and to attaine and aſpire vnto them. And in deed he could not know them, till he felt himſelfe touched by the

ſeuere hand of God, which hauing ſharply ſtricken him in his body, did by a long diſeaſe afflict him, and purged and illuminated him interiourly, therby to looſe him from the bondes of the deuill, the world, and the fleſh.
               
               
                  Of his firſt vocation, from his ſeculer to a ſpirituall life, by many apparitions and viſions from God.
                  THE II. CHAPTER.
                  THe ſeruant of God Francis being cured of his foreſaid corporall ſicknes, and confirmed in his ſoule by new purpoſes and newHis extreme charity. feruours, hauing occaſion to walk into the feildes, he mett in the way a man that in his countenance and comportment ſeemed a gentleman, but was for the preſent in miſerable eſtate, poore, ragged and in ſhamefull condition. Francis beholding him, immediately repreſented vnto his memory our moſt noble, but poore king, IESVS CHRIST being in the world, of whome he had ſo ſtrong an apprehenſion, as if he had ſeene him before his eyes, and thence he conceiued ſuch a compaſsion of this poore man, that calling him aſide, he putt off his garmentes wherwith he was attired and cloathed him therwith. The night following, he ſaw in an imaginary viſion ſleeping, a faire lardge hall full of verie rich armures, all ſigned with the croſſe, and God for whoſe loue he had giuen his cloathesA viſion which he had. to the poore man, ſhewing them vnto him, who moſt aſſuredly promiſed him to giue all the armures which he ſaw to him and his, if he would vndertake the triumphant ſtandard of the croſſe, and couragiouſly follow him. Francis awaking, interpreted this viſion to be of temporall cheualry, wherein all Chriſtianity was then earneſtly exerciſed, for the conqueſt of the holy land, the Chriſtians being there vnto induced by the bulle of the Croiſadoe, wherin the Pope granted plenary indulgence to all them that would vndertake ſo Catholike an entrepriſe: called Croiſadoe, becauſe all the horſe and foot men did weare for deuiſe or badge, the croſſe on their caſſakes and mandillians. Now Francis hauing formerly had ſome deſire to ſerue God in this voyage, reſolued and prepared himſelfe there vnto, hauing conceiued a full ioye, and hope, to become a famous and honoured Capitaine, as God (according to his owne interpretation) had promiſed him. Being therfore demaunded of diuers whence proceeded that his exceeding

ioy, and the extraordinary contentment which he exteriourly diſcouered; he anſweared them, that it was out of a firme▪ aſſurance which he had, in ſhort time to become great. Hauing then compleately furniſhed himſelfe with armours, ſeruantes, horſes, and whatſoeuer ſeemed neceſſary, he haſtened to Apulia to find out an Earle who was elected one of the principall heades of the enterpriſe, ſuppoſing that ſeruing him, he might after ſome worthy exploytes of armes, be honoured att lenght with the Order of knight hood: but the firſt night after he was departed, he heard the voice of God, that finally ſaid vnto him: Francis, who can more benefit thee, or better aduance thee, the Maſter, or the ſeruant? a rich man, or a poore? He anſweared, without queſtion, the maſter, &amp; he that is rich. The voice replyed: Why then leaueſt thou the Lord, for the ſeruant; and for a very poore man, God that is moſt rich? Francis thereto as an other S. Paul, thus ſaid: O my God, what wilt thou then that I doe? Retourne (anſweared the voice) to thy contry, for the firſt viſion which thou haddeſt, ſignified a ſpirituall worck. and not a terreſtriall, which is to be accompliſhed in thee, not by humane fauour, in no ſort, but by diuine diſpoſition. Francis then being thus changed, thee next morning full of ioy and aſſurance, he ſpeedilie tourned his iorney towardes his contry, beginning to feele in himſelfe that contentment which perfect obedience and reſignation of ones ſelfe to God, doth cauſe and procure to the ſpirit, with hope that his diuine maieſty would giue him vnderſtanding of his further pleaſure. And thenceforward withdrawing himſelfe from worldly companies and entanglements, his endeauour and cogitation was only deuoutly to beſeeche the diuine clemencie, to make him worthy to know wherin he ſhould employ himſelfe for his ſeruice. For although by the continuall vſe of his frequent and daily deuotions, he felt to encreaſe in himſelfe the flame of diuine deſires, and that by reaſon of his affection to the celeſtiall Hiotuſalem, he thenceforward contemned whatſoeuer could detaine him from it, and that he already deſired to be entierly exerciſed in the ſeruice of God: he neuertheles did not yet vnderſtand in what mannr he ſhould be therin employed, he only by an interiour inſpiration conceiued, that God reuealed vnto him that this ſpirituall affaire was to be enterpriſed and begun, by contempt of the world, and that the cheuarly of IESVS CHRIST began by victory ouer ones ſelfe. Being then thus retired into a ſolitary place, and by continuall prayers and ſighinges, demanding the grace of IESVS CHRIST to be directed into the true way, he heard a voice proceeding from a Crucifix that ſaid: Francis, if thou wilt know my will, it is requiſite

that thou hate and abhorre whatſoeuer thou haſt to thisA Crucifix ſpeaketh vnto him. preſent vainely affected and deſired: which if thou doeſt, thou ſhalt feele a new taſt and ſweetnes, in that which heretofore ſeemed to thee bitter and inſupportable; and that which did accuſtome to content thee, thou ſhalt diſdaine. Francis hauing heard this leſſon of IESVS CHRIST, and often interiourly reflecting theron, he chaunced one day as he trauelled one the plaine of Aſsiſsium, to meete a poore leaper, wheratt he was att the firſt apprehenſion afflicted, beholding him with diſdaine and contempt, but incontinently remembring the purpoſe and reſolution he had already made, to embrace perfection, and that to be a champion or warryer of IESVS CHRIST, it was neceſſary for him to ouercome himſelf, alighting from his horſe, he ran to embrace and kiſſe the leaper, and hauing giuen him a liberal almoſe, he mounted againe on hisHe kiſſeth a Leaper. horſe, and looking about all that plaine he could no more ſet eye one that leaper: wherfore being repleniſhed with ioy and feare together, he gaue thanckes to God, and perſeuering in continuall prayer, teares, and ſighinges, he merited to be heard in his pious deuotions. Being one daye in prayer, as in regard of his great feruour, he was entierly as it were ſwallowed vp in God, IESVS CHRIST crucified appeared vnto him, by whoſe ſight, his ſoule al melted into compaſsion, and the doloursGod appeareth vnto him. of the paſsion of our Sauiour did ſo pearce his bowels and his interiour, that as often thenceforward as that dolourous paſsion was repreſented to his memory, could he with his vtmoſt endeauour ſcarcely ſuppreſſe his teares and ſighes, as himſelf a litle before his death recounted. This man of God then Francis by this viſion felt imprinted

And from that hower, he was cloathed with the ſpiritt of the loue of God, of patience, humility, and piety, by which diuine loue, eſteeming no more, but rather contemning all his temporall goodes, and what ſoeuer he could euer expect of the world, he perceiued and felt in his ſowle, that God had diſcouered vnto him a hidden treaſure of infinite worth, for the fruition wherof, burning as it were, and rapt out of himſelfe, he determined to ſell al that he had, and to diſtribute the price therof amongſt the poore, making by this meane an exchaunge, of
                        Matt. 13. worldly traffique for an Euangelicall traffique, which procureth true celeſtiall richeſſe. In this manner did God draw this his ſeruant

from prophane houſes and ſhoppes of merchandiſe, an other Matthew from danger of vniuſt exactions; and diſpoſed him to follow his ſteppes, reiecting al other poſſeſsiō, to enioy the moſt precious pearle of Euangelicall perfection, whichwith his vtmoſt poſsibility he ſought, found, and purchaſed. And in teſtimony and aſſurance of a true, quiet, and full poſſeſsion therof, our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST made him a contract therof written on the parchement of his owne fleſh, ſigned and ſealed by the hand of the ſeller himſelfe IESVS CHRIST, with the ſeale of his moſt ſacred woundes: which he did to banniſh from the world by meane and example of this his moſt deuout ſeruant, the enormous and intollerable banckes and vſuries, and the fraudes in traffikes too commonly practiſed in the worlde, to the end to further poore Chriſtians in a deſire of buying the ſaid precious and celeſtiall pearle, by the traffike of penitence, of vertues, and of the glorious following and imitation of IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  Of his laborious endeauours to ſeparate himſelfe from the vvorld.
                  THE III. CHAPTER.
                  FRancis being very carefull, and often conſulting with himſelfe how he might become more poore, to pleaſe IESVS CHRIST, renouncing the world, and forſaking whatſoeuer therof appertayned vnto him with diſtribution therof vnto the poore, there being no perſon to counſail him in this matter, but his Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, his diuine goodnes omitted not to viſitt him further by his holy grace: For departing out of the citty of Aſsiſium, with intention to ſeeke ſome ſolitary place, to mediate and performe his deuotion, he paſt by the ſide of a Church of S. Damian, which by reaſon of extreme antiquity was euen ready to fall. He being touched by the holy Ghoſt entred in, and falling on his knees before the image of the Crucifix, he felt his ſoule repleniſhed with an admirable conſolation of the holy Ghoſt; wherfore with an extreme feruour he thrice iterated this prayer vnto God: O high and glorious God, myA worthy prayer of the S. Lord IESVS CHRIST, illuminate and lighten the obſcurities of my hart, giue me, if it pleaſe thee, a right faith, an aſſured hope, a perfect charity, a knowledge of thee my God, in ſuch ſort that he may euer performe thy true and holy will, Amen. Beholding

afterwardes the Crucifix with a ſerious attention, his eyes filled and his face bathed with teares, he heard with his corporall eares a voice addreſſed vnto him from the Crucifix, which three ſeuerall times thus ſpake vnto him: Goe Francis, and repaire my houſe, that is ready to fall: This ſo merueillous voice did exceedingly terrifie him beingA Cruciſix ſpeaketh againe vnto him. alone in the Church: wherupon vtterly amazed, and feeling in himſelfe the force and vertue of thoſe wordes, he fell into a ſound, but retourning att lenght to himſelfe; he incontinently prepared to obey and to reeſtabliſh that materiall Church, wherin he had preſented his ſaid prayer, not as yet vnderſtanding the ſence of the wordes of God to be, that he ſhould repaire that other Church, redeemed by his precious bloud. So that riſing from the ground and ſigning himſelfe with the holy Croſſe, he retourned to the citty, where he aſſembled all the marchandiſe that his Father had committed to his charge to traffike, and ſent it to Foliginum, where he ſold it all, and the horſe alſo wheron he rode, then haſtened to the ſaidHe ſelleth his fathers marchandiſe to repaire a Church. Church of S. Damian, there to accompliſh that which he ſuppoſed God had commanded him. In which place hauing offered his deuotion, he ſaw the Preiſt that ſerued there, to whome he preſented all the mony he had, to rebuild and repaire that church, and to releiue the poore: beſides, he humby beſought him that he would for certaine dayes receiue him into his company. The preiſt anſwered that he would willingly entertaine his perſon; but would not accepte his mony, in regard of his Father and his kinred: and therfore the true miſpriſer of richeſſe caſtinto a windoe that there he ſaw againſt a wall, the purſſe wherin his mony was, which he there left in contempt as baſe earth, regarding nothing but to vnite himſelf with God, in the company of that Preiſt. His Father vnderſtanding all this, full of indignation and anger againſt him, laboured to find him out: but Francis getting aduertiſment therof, as yet a freſh ſoldier of IESVS CHRIT, fearing the threates of his Father, and to giue way to his choller, hid himſelf in a caue, where he continued certaine dayes, with abondance of teares continually praying God to vouchſafe to deliuer his ſoule from the handes of thoſe that perſecuted him; and that his holy will would ſo much fauour him, as being to effect the pious deſires which he had vouchſafed to inſpire vnto him. After he had a certaine time continued his prayers, he began to condemne himſelfe of litle courage, and therfore expelling all feare, he aroſe out of the caue, and went to Aſsiſium, armed with the magnanimity and vertu of the moſt high, to tread vnder foot the ſerpentes of worldly perſecution,

                     S. Francis reputed a fool of his companions. wherby the deuill thought to enforce his retire. His fellow cittizens ſeeing him vtterly disfigured, as if he had bin bereaued of his ſences, ſaid that he was mad, and the litle children followed him, caſting ſtones and dirt att him, and crying after him in the ſtreetes, as if he had bin a foole. But the ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST in regard of all that, loſt not his courage, nor altered his purpoſe for whatſoeuer he iniuſtly endured, but went peaceably, as if he had bin deafe, blind and inſenſible, reſpecting litle or nothing to be reputed a foole in the world, prouided that he might afterwardes proue wiſe with IESVS CHRIST in heauen. Now his Father hearing theſe cryes, and ſeeing his eldeſt ſonne thus abuſed, he ran as a roaringIll entreated of his owne Father. lyon, not to deliuer him from thoſe contemptible reproaches, but himſelfe to treat him more diſdainfully then all the reſt, as if he had bin no longer his Father. In ſuch ſort that he conducted him to his owne houſe, where hauing extremely iniuried and beaten him, he cauſed him to be chayned, and ſo ſhutt into a chamber, vſing him himſelfe as if he had bin a foole, thincking by theſe tormentes to reduce him vnto his former eſtate. But ſo far was the true ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST from being any way terrified, or withdrawen from his former pious reſolution, that on the contrary he became therby more firme and conſtant, and more accuſtomed to ſupport all; calling often to his minde that worthy ſaying of the Goſpell: Bleſſed are they that ſuffer perſecution for iuſtice, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen; and that which our redeemer himſelfe ſaid: If any man come to me and hatethLuc. 14. not his Father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and ſiſters, yea and his owne life beſides: he cannot be my diſciple. The which ſpeculation was then moſt exquiſitely practiſed by God, in the perſon of his ſeruant Francis, who was not only derided of his freindes and kinred, but much more of his Father himſelfe. It might doubteleſſe be eſteemed a hart of flintTreated as atheife or ſteele, that was not moued to compaſsion to ſee him ſo tormented by his owne Father; and that admired not the cruelty of the one, and the patience of the other. But glorious Francis who had his ſpiritt vnited with IESVS CHRIST, by whome he was comforted, did in the meane time thus encourage himſelfe, that by theſe ſtrokes of the hammer of affliction, God would forge of him a merueillous and admirable veſſell, baked and purged in the fournace of moſt panifull croſſes and labours, to dilate and amplifie his

glory and to renew his memory on earth. Certaine dayes then after yong Francis was committed to priſon, his father vppon occaſion of his affaires being gone out of Aſsiſium, his mother who was not pleaſed with that her husband had done, conceiuing a naturall compaſsion of her ſonne, went to ſee him, and with the gentle and ſweet ſpeeches of a mother, endeauoured to perſuade him to obey his father, accompanying her wordes that were of them ſelues ſufficiently pregnant and effectuall, with abondance of teares. This certainly was no ſclender aſſault and combatt to the new champion, whoſe mother could nothing preuaile in that she deſired: for he lett her know that his obligation was more to God then to his father or mother, and beſides, that he was reſolued to follow the inſpiration which he had receiued of the holy Ghoſt: Then he tourned his ſpeech to his mother her ſelfe, exhorting her to acknoledge the great benefitt which she had receiued of God, in that he called her ſonne to his ſeruice, and that therfore she ought to be thankfull vnto him. This woman att length ouer comme with the reaſons of her child, and deſperate of force euer to ſupplant his firme reſolution and conſtantie, and with all touched with a motherlyHis mother ſetteth him att liberty. compaſsion, looſed his chaines, and imparting vnto him her benediction she diſmiſſes him. Francis finding himſelfe att liberty, ſaluted his mother, and prayed her to be no more afflicted in his regard, and then retourned to the fore ſaid Church to giue thankes to the Soueraigne Redeemer for what ſoeuer had happened vnto him. But his father being retourned, and not finding his ſonne in the place where he left him, hauing greiuouſly checked and iniuried his wife for diſmiſsing him, he ran vtterly enraged into the ſaid Church with reſolution to procure his baniſhment out of his contry, as a diſhonour vnto him, if he ſhould perſiſt in his former reſolution. The victorious Francis preſented himſelfe before his Father, to intertaine him graciously, notwithſtanding he preceiued him to be extreme furious, and with an aſſured and ioyfull countenance ſaid vnto him: Father; I feare not att all your threates, your beatinges, your fetteringes, nor all you tormentes: for I am ready to endure ſuch perſecution as you deſire to inflict on me for the loue of my God. Which his father hauing heard, and knowing well that he ſhould neuer moue nor ſtagger his ſtable and cōſtant reſolution, he then thought att leaſt to redeeme and recouer the mony which his ſonne had receiued for his merchandiſe, and to that end ſought information of the Preiſt how it was imployed: but in the meaneHis father hauing his mony is appeaſed while he ſeemed to perceiue a great purſe vpon a window, whereto goeing neere, he found that it was his mony; which hauing ſeazed on, it much appeaſed his fury, the burning thirſt of his auarice

being ſomewhat moderated by the application of this medicine.
               
               
                  How the ſeruant of Ieſus Christ Francis renounced his father, not only touching his due, but euen reſtored vnto him all the garments wherwith he was cloathed, diſapparelling himſelfe euen to his shirt, and this in preſence of the bishop of Aſsiſium.
                  THE IIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe terreſtriall father of the glorious Francis being not yet ſatiated with the cruelties inflicted on him, would tempt the ſonne of grace in temporall abilities, ſeeking to conſtraine him to render and renounce the dew portion which of his father he was to haue, and to this effect conducted him before the biſhop of the citty. Now the father thus proceeded for feare that being dead, his ſonne ſhould diſtribut the part of his ſucceſsion among the poore. S. Francis vnderſtanding it, went very willingly before the biſhop, as a true louer of pouerty and obedient child, without expecting further ſummoning, and without
                        •
                      any conſideration of the matter, and there he did not only moſt readily renounce his paternall ſucceſsion, but euen putt off the garmentes wherwith he was cloathed, to his very ſhirte, in preſence of the biſhop and diuers others, without bluſhing any thinge theratt, being mindefull of our moſt gracious IESVS CHRIT, who for vs was nailed naked vnto the croſſe.! Then he made a litle bundle of his cloathes, and deliueredS. Francis is naked to rē

The biſhop ſeeing ſo ſtrange a ſpecctacle, nothing reſting on the body of poore Francis but his haire cloth, and preceiuing on the other ſide that the father ſupported and endured to ſee his ſonne naked without any compaſsion of his hart: conſidering with all in the ſonne ſuch an extraordinary feruour, with ſo admirable and exceſsiue patience: he reputed him the true ſeruant of God, and therefore ariſing and ſtanding vp, he with gracious ſweetnes receiued him into his armes, and as a pious Paſtour, couered him with his owne gowne, and commanded his ſeruantes to bring him a garment; whervpon they

A right heroicall act, worthy of very great conſideration, and merueillous to ſee after what manner the world (the true ſoldier of the deuill, our cruell ennemie) reduceth to nothing thoſe that deſire truely to ſerue God, leauing them euen naked without wherwithall to couer them. We ought here to conſider, how neceſſary it is for the good and vertuous to meſpriſe the wealth of the world, and not to feare the inconueniences therof, to disburthen them of the weight of the earth, with the greater alacrity to carry the burden of our Redeemer, and finally in a certaine ſort to diſnaturalize them ſelues, forſaking father, and mother, and worldly kinred, to become cittizens of heauen. Thus was the ſeruant of the moſt mighty Monarque, diſchardged of his terreſtriall father to follow our naked IESVS CHRIST crucified whom he loued; and ſo armed with the armours of the croſſe, he recommanded his ſoule to the tree of life, by the vertue wherof he ſecured himſelfe from the tempeſtuous ſea of this world.
               
               
                  Of the exerciſes wherin the ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt Francis, thence forward employed himſelfe.
                  THE V. CHAPTER.
                  THis contemner of the world being then freed of the chaines, and deliured of the threates of his Father, went into the deſert, that there alone, and in ſilence, he might heare the ſecrettes of the diuine worde. And as he walked on a mountaine, ſinging the prayſes of God in the French tongue, he was aſſaulted by certaine theeues, who rudely examined him what he was and what he ſought there: to whome he anſweared as a Prophett: I am an herauld of the great king. They diſdayining this anſweare, came neereS. Francis was beaten of theeues. and beate him; and after many threatning wordes, they caſt him into a ditch of ſnow that was there, ſaying: Thou ſhalt now lye there as a caitife herauld of the great king. But Francis they being retired, came out of the ditch, and filled with exceeding contentment, began againe to praiſe God: after he had a long time walked, he came to a Monaſtery, where as a poore begger, he demanded almoſe

for the loue of God, which he receiued. Thence he went to the citty of Agubio, where being knowne vnto an ancient frend of his, curteously entertayned him into his houſe. And in regard that he was ſo naked, this frend couered him with a poore cloake, which ſerued him two yeares, carrying a ſtaffe in his hand, as an hermite, with ſhooes on his feet, and girt with a lether belt, which made him eſteemed to be Religious of the Order of S. Auguſtin. Now this affectour of humility deſirous to lay a firme and ſtable foundation to his ſpirituall edifice, exerciced himſelfe in the actiue life, to witt in workes of charity towardes his neighbour, entertayninge his life with much auſterity and mortification. For hauing vanquiſhed and trodden vnder foot the loue ofS. Francis ſerueth leapers. Eſaye 53.
                      himſelfe, and transferred it vnto his neighbour, his affection was entierly, repoſed and ſetled in Ieſus Chriſt, by reaſon that whiles he was yet worldly, he abhorred the acceſſe of leapers, but now enflamed and ennamoured of IESVS CHRIST who (Iſay) was contemned in the world, and vlcered as a leapar, ſo that he ſeemed no more to be a man. That he might the more pefectly ſubiect his will to the ſpiritt, he entierly applyed himſelfe to the ſeruice of leapers, often viſiting them in their owne houſes, traueilling to gett almoſe for them, kiſsing theirHe demā

Sometimes alſo he layd hisAdmirable mortificatiōs of ſaint Francis. mouth on the earth, amiddle the duſt, that accuſtoming himſelfe to contemptes and reproches, he might ſubiect the pride of the fleſh to the law of the ſpiritt, and might procure to be a peaceable and perfect poſſeſſour of himſelfe, by which exerciſe he obtayned of God ſo great vertues as he had incredible puiſſance, to cure ſpirituall and corporall diſeaſes. I will here to this purpoſe ſett downe one miracle, among diuers others which ſhalbe recorded in this hiſtory in their place. There was a man of the Dukedome of Spoletum that had on his face a moſt hideous and perillous ſoare, that had already conſumed and eaten oneHecureth one of an vlcer in kiſsing it of his iawes, and a great part of his mouth, and wheras no remedy could be procured to his infirmity, he vowed to goe to Rome to viſitt the ſepulchres of the holy Apoſtles, to craue their interceſsion, and to implore the mercy of God, that he would be pleaſed to deliuer him of that ſo greuious and loathſome diſeaſe. Now as he retourned to his houſe, hauing accompliſhed his vow, he mett the bleſſed Francis on the way, before whome this diſeaſed enclined himſelfe to kiſſe his feet,

by reaſon that his countenance was exceeding venerable: But the humble ſeruant of God not permitting it, ſtept back. The diſeaſed ariſing, the imitatour of Ieſus Chriſt embraced him, and kiſſed his face; which hauing performed with a merucillous compaſsion, att the very inſtant that horrible vlcere and the mouth being kiſſed, were incontinently cured. I know not in deed which of the two is more admirable, eitherHis charitie towarde the poore the profound humility of the S. in kiſsing the wound, or the excellency of his vertue in worcking ſuch a miracle. He did not exerciſe this charity only towardes leapers; but did alſo extend ſuch liberality to all poore peole, that ſometimes leauing himſelfe halfe naked to couer thē, he deſired beſides to giue his owne perſon, and eſpetially to poore preiſtes,He laboured to keep the churches and their ornamēts in decencie. How he affected pouerty. whome he aſsiſted with great piety and reuerence. He was likewiſe very zealous and carefull of the ornamētes of Altars and of Churches, ſo that he did often make them cleane and decent with his owne handes, that by them God might be ſerued with more honour and reuerence. To this glorious Saint, pouerty ſeemed the moſt precious thing in the word, all his ambition was to poſſeſſe the ſame, in this reſpect only was he enuious if an other were poorer then himſelfe. Goeing on to offer his deuotions att S. Peters in Rome, among a great multitude of poore that were there att the dore, he eſpied one moſt wretched and miſerable, almoſt naked and vncouered, of whome he had ſuch compaſsion, and was ſo enflamed with the loue of pouerty, that puttning off his owne garment he gaue it to the poore Creature, and cloathed himſelfe with the others ragges, and took ſuch content therein', that he remayned all that day with thoſe poore people, with exceeding alacrity, reioycing in pouerty, in contempt of the glory of the world, learning by ſuch and the like worckes of charity, firſt to practiſe and performe, and then to teach, following the ſteppes of his true maſter IESVS CHRIST, whoſe life and doctrine he ſhould practiſe and teach to mortall men. Being one day of the winter ſo poorely cloathed, that much of the nakednes of his body appeared, and hearing the holy maſſe, a Brother of his by chaunce mett him there, who ſcoffinglie asked him if he would ſell him for ſix pence of his ſweat. The ſeruant of God ioyfully anſweared, I haue ſold it all at a good price to my God and lord. He might doutles affirme it with good reaſon, conſidering he was continually buſied in workes of charity towardes his neighbour, and in exerciſes of humility, ſurmounting the nature of his ſences, yet without omitting mentall conuerſation with IESVS CHRIST crucified: for more cōmodious fruition wherof, he frequented hermitages and ſolitary places, employing his time in prayer and weeping: neither would he thence depart til he had learned ſome extraordinary faſhiō of faſting.
               
               
                  
                  How S. Francis repaired three Churches.
                  THE VI. CHAPTER.
                  THis glorious Saint was ſo well grounded in the vertue of ſimplicity and of the charity of IESVS CHRIST, that calling to his minde what had bin miraculously cōmanded him by the Crucifix, which was, that that he ſhould reeſtabliſh his Church, ſuppoſing that he meant the ſaid Church of S. Damian, he retourned, as an obedient ſeruant, to Aſsiſium, purpoſing by almes to execute and accompliſh that, which he could not doe with the mony of his fathers merchandiſe, and this his deſsigne had good ſucceſſe. For ſeeking ouer the citty (where he was alreadie knowne to be the ſeruant of God) he found mony among his freindes and kinred, and matter requiſite for the building of the ſaid Church. So aſſociating him ſelfe with the Preiſt that ſerued there, he began the ſaid reparation: wanting nether maſters, nor worckmen to this effect, he neuertheles without intermiſsion employed his owne perſon therin, that his body being already weakened, by continuall faſtes and ordinary abſtinences, might be more ſubiected and chaſticed, as well by carrying burdenſome ſtones, as by the mortification he endured, in demaunding of them, to whome he had formerly giuen. Thus by the grace of God and the deuotion of the faithfull, he ſo well endeauoured, that he accompliſhed the reparation of the ſaid Church: in which labour the ſaid Preiſt perceiuing how painfully he employed himſelfe for ſo holy an enterpriſe, alwayes reſerued ſomethinge to refectionate and releiue him. But the humble ſeruant of God could not long endure that, as being deſirous to ſerue, and not to be ſerued of any. Wherupon he ſaid once in himſelfe: Is it conuenient that thou haue alwayes a preiſt toHe will not liue but by almoſe. ſerue thee? Is that the way of pouerty which thou ſeekeſt? and then he reſolued to be no longer ſerued, by preiſt or other perſon, and when he would eate, he tooke a diſh and went to the dores with other poore people to demaund almoſe for the loue of God: and with them did there eat what was giuen him. And albeit this was att the begining very ſharpe and difficult vnto him, yet in the progreſſe it was ſo pleaſing and contentfull, that he afterward affirmed to his Religious, that he neuer eat with ſo good an appetite as then. Being one day inuited to eat with a Prelate; he would eat nothing but

what he had brought with him of almoſe giuen att the dores. Saint Francis hauing finiſhed the reparation of the Church of S. Damian, went to repaire an other of S. Peter farther off from the citty, and byHerepaireth the Church of S. Peter. the ſame meanes that he vſed in the former, he in ſhort time accompliſhed this alſo. After that he went to Porticella, very neere to Aſsiſium, where was a Church dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which was ſo abandoned, that there was no perſon had c

He for the great deuotion he had to the Queene of heauen remained therin; and incontinently began to thinck of repayring it; and being there often viſited by the Angels (conformably to the title of the Church which was S. Mary of Angels) he the moreAnd that of our lady of Angels. willingly ſtayed there, and affected that place aboue all other, becauſe therin he began humbly, proceeded and fought valiantly; and there ended moſt bleſſedly. There by diuine reuelation did he begin the foundation of the rule and order of the Frier Minors, which was not without myſterie, but by diſpoſition of the diuine prouidence, which gouerned him, inſtructed and directed him in all his deſsignes: So that this worthey ſeruant of God, repaired three materiall Churches, of S. Damian, S. Peter, and S. Mary of Angels; and all this before the inſtitution of his Order, and his preaching of the goſpell, as well that from theſe ſencible thinges he might attaine to intellectuall, and from leſſer matters by courſe and ordre to great; as alſo that what he ſhould doe might firſt be reuealed vnto him by the myſtery of ſenſible▪ thinges; to the end it might appeare, that as he had reeſtabliſhed three Churches, ſo alſo that of IESVS CHRIST ſhould be by him renewed and repayred, according to the forme, rule, and doctrine which he would giue him, as we ſee apparantly to haue ſucceeded in the three exerciſes or warfares (if you will) which are the three Orders which ſaint Francis inſtitued in the world.
               
               
                  Of the ſecond vocation to the estate of Euangelicall perfection, and how he began his rule.
                  THE VII. CHAPTER.
                  THe worthy of God hauing choſen for his reſidence the Church of the mother of IESVS CHRIST, and therin perſeuering in cōtinuall feruent deuotions, beſeeching her to be his aduocate,

his prayers were of ſuch efficacie, that by the merittes of the glorious virgin, he was alſo found worthy to conceiue and produce the ſpiritt of verity and of Euangelicall pouerty. For as he one day deuoutly heard the maſſe of the Apoſtles, where the goſpell is read wherin our lord IESVS CHRIST preſcribeth thē the forme of the Euāgelicall life,
                        Mat. 10. when he ſent them to preach ouer the world to this purpoſe ſaying: Do not poſſeſſe gold, nor ſiluer, nor purſes, not a ſcripp for the way, neither two coates, neither ſhooes, neither rodde. And into what ſoeuerHow he tooke occaſion to begin his first rule. place you shall enter ſalute it, ſaying: the peace of God be in this houſe. S. Francis hearing this, cryed out with more then a naturall voice; That is it which I ſeeke, that is it which the interiour of my hart deſireth; and thē was he repleniſhed by the holy ſpiritt of IESVS CHRIST with ſuch a vertue, that it did not only trāsforme him into the ſaid for▪ me and rule, in cōſent and deſire: but euen in operations and effectes: for immediatly he putt of his ſhooes, he reiected his ſtaffe and wallet. He caſt away the mony which remayned vnto him of almoſe, and contenting himſelfe with one only garment or coate, reiected euen the leſſer belt wherewith he was girded, and vſed a corde, being more carefull then to conforme himſelfe perfectly to the Apoſtolicall life. Vpon this Euangelicall leſſon, in this week and on this day, which was the yeare of our lord, one thouſand two hundred and eight, in the month of October and feaſt of S. Luke, this bleſſed S. began the rule ofThe first inſtitutiō of the order of Frier Minors Epheſ. 2.
                      the Frier Minors, being then twenty ſeauen yeares of age, two yeares from his cōuerſion being expired, the twelueth yeare of Pope Innocent the third: a worck proceeding verilie from the holy Ghoſt by the goſpell of IESVS CHRIST, not from any humane ſpiritt though God for an inſtrumēt would vſe his moſt faithfull ſeruant, as founder of ſo glorious a fabrick, who, as a prudent Architect, layd the foundation of his Order with violent floudes of teares, with moſt feruent prayers, with worckes of mercie, of penance, and of retirednes and coniunction vnto God, neuer wearied nor deſiſting, till the holy Ghoſt had giuē him the foundatiō of the Apoſtles and Prophets, which is that ſoueraigne &amp; ſtable corner ſtone IESVS CHRIST, on whome the whole edifice being gounded▪ and referred vnto, it encreaſed in this holy temple1. Cor. 3. Matth. 7. of God, vpon whome the S. did not build his order with the chaffe of vaine titles, or of temporall poſſeſsions, nor with the dirty dregges of worldly and periſhable thinges: but with purified gold which is the Euangelicall ſpiritt, and with precious ſtones, which are the Apoſtolical Counſailes: by meanes wherof it was then ſecurely guarded againſt the force of wind, waters and tempeſtes, the furious ennemies therof. He began thenceforth to be like vnto Helie by diuine inſpiration, zealous

of the trueth, of the glory of God, and his neighbours ſaluation; inducing many to follow and embrace the way of perfection, and mouing each one to patience. His diſcourſes were no more vaine &amp; ridiculous, but repleniſhed with the vertue of the holy Ghoſt, and ſuch as penetrated the hart of the hearers, and were of ſuch efficacie, that they terrified the audience in regard of their ſinnes, ſo that they were penitent therof, and the hartes of the obſtinate, they ſoftened and mollified. Thus did he conuert ſinners, and confirme the good in the right way of their ſaluation.
               
               
                  Of the two firſt diſciples of S. Francis.
                  THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe vertue of this worthy ſeruant of God being dilated and diuulged in many places, as well in regard of the verity of his ſimple doctrine, as for the ſanctity of his life, many gentlemen were deſirous to endeauour alſo in penitentiall practiſes to imitate him. The firſt was a rich and honorable cittizen of Aſsiſium, called Bernardus Quintualle, very famous for his prudence, who hauing long time conſidered the extraordinary chaunge of life of S. Francis, how he contemned the world, and with what conſtancie and patience he ſupported iniuries, and that the more contemptible he was reputed, the more appeared his pleaſure and content therin, neuer ſhewing the leaſt apparance of will to chaung his holy purpoſe; he eſteemed and reſoluedA Gentleman deſireous to knowe with what ſpiritt S. Francis was moued, and proued him. with himſelfe att lenght, that the ſame could be no other but a worck of God; neuertheles he thought to proue and trye him, and to that end, after many prayers to ſupp with him, he conducted him to his houſe: where being ſett att the table (more couered with ſpirituall, then corporall food) they diſcourſed of many notable matters. Now the hower being come of takinge their reſt, the honorable Bernard conducted the S. together with him into a chamber where there were two beddes, and each of them tooke one to lodge in: but the ſaid Bernard, that deſired to proue ſome thing of this S. did ſubtilly fayne himſelfe incontinently to ſleepe: which the S. beleeiuing, roſe a lite after from his bed, fell on his knees, and directed his countenance and handes towardes heauen, entierly enflamed with diuine loue, and being ſo on his knees, he began to pray with theſe wordes: Deus meus &amp; omma. My God and althinges; O my God whoſe are all thinges, O my God who art all myThe prayer of S. Francis. good. Quintaualle heard only thoſe words which the S. often repeated, powring out abondance of teares, it ſeeming vnto him that his ſpiritt

receiued exceeding conſolation thereof, without euer vttering any other word that he could vnderſtand. The ſeruant of God perſiſted till the morning in this prayer, wherin his ſpirit was eleuated in extaſie, conſidering the great mercy which he had receiued of the diuine maieſty, and that he vouch-ſafed to vſe him for his ſeruice in this world, as he had vnderſtood by reuelatiō; Wherupon conceiuing the importance of the affaire, he acknowledged his inſufficiencie and impotencie; and therfore inceſſantly played God to graunt him perfection requiſite to the enterpriſed worck, that he might ſerue him according to his deſire. Then with exceeding affection he ſaid: Thou art my God, and all my hope: all my force, my richeſſe, my life, my ioy, my ſatisfaction, and all that euer I can deſire; I poſſeſſe no other thing but thee. It is thou that haſt begun to fauour me with thy grace: graunt alſo, my moſt ſweet Lord, that I perſeuer therein, and that therwith▪ I be guided to my deſired end. And hereupon perſiſting in the profound conſideration of himſelfe, with a merueillous humility reputing himſelfe to be nothing, he caſt him into the armes of the diuine &amp; celeſtiall loue, where he felt in his ſoule that ſweet communication of the grace of God. The foreſaid Bernard hauing then ſeene and heard thus much by meanes of a lampe, which he had left burning in the chamber, and knowing all to be true, the day appearing, and the holy man riſing from his prayer, Bernard ſpake vnto him in this ſort: O Francis, tell me I pray thee, what ought the ſeruant to doe, to whome the maſter hauing imparted many commodities behoufull for his vſe, he would no longer make vſe of them. The S. made anſweare vnto him ſaying. He ought to reſtore them to the party that beſtowed them on him. Bernard replyed: it ought doubtles ſo to be; and therfore, Francis my friend, I will for the loue of God diſtribute the temporall ſubſtance which till this preſent I haue enioyed, hauing receiued them as his gift, and this I will doe by your aduiſe; for I will obey and follow you in this, and in euery other thing that you ſhall command me. Which the S. vnderſtanding, full of ioy thus anſweared him: Bernard, this worck is of ſuch difficulty, that before it beAn other occaſion of the first rule of S. Francis. enterpriſed, we muſt take counſail of God, and affectionatly beſeech him to make knowne vnto vs his will, and how we may accompliſh the ſame; and att the inſtant they went together to the Church of S. Nicolas, and in the way a Canon named Petrus Catanio aſſociated himſelfe vnto them, who likewiſe deſired to follow the S. Being then arriued att the Church, and hauing heard maſſe and offered their

deuotions, S. Francis comming to the Preiſt, prayed him to make the ſigne of the Croſſe on the miſſal, and then to open it, and the preiſt obeying, att the openning of the miſſal they lighted on the goſpell taken out of the 19. of S. Matthew: If thou wilt be perfect, goe, ſell the thinges that thou haſt, and giue to the poore, and thou ſhalt haue treaſure in heauen. Att which Councell the S. exceedingly reioyced, and for it thancked God many times. And as a perfect ſeruant of the moſt bleſſed Trinity, he demaunded of God that he would vouchſafe by three ſeuerall teſtimonies to confirme the rule which they ſhould vndertake; and ſo they opened the booke the ſecond time, and lighted on the text of the ſame S. Matthew in the tenth chapter: Goeing thorough the world, you ſhall not carry any thing with you, neither ſiluer, two coates, ſhooes, nor ſtaffe: and this hauing confirmed them, they the third time opened the Miſſal, and found a text of the ſame S. Matthew in the ſixteenth chapter: If any man will come after me, lett him denie himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe, and follow me. S. Francis then tourning to his two new champions, ſaid vnto them: My Brethren, you haue now heard our rule, and theirs that will adhereBr. Bernard Quintaualle giueth his ſubſtance to the poore to become a Frier Minor. vnto vs. If therfore you deſire to be perfect, you muſt preſently putt in execution what you haue heard. Wherupon the ſaid Bernardus Quintaualle gott licence of S. Francis to goe to his houſe, where he ſold all his ſubſtance, and diſtributed it to the poore, without reſeruing any thing whatſoeuer. So making himſelfe worthy of the diuine vocatiō, he merited to be the firſt diſciple of this holy Father. The Canon afterward did as much; for hauing renounced his Canonry, he gaue all the reſt to the poore; therfore he alſo was worthy to be a Sonne of this holy Father. S. Francis the ſixteenth of Aprill of the yeare 1209. gaue to them both his habitt. Vpon this occaſion there are ſome of opinion that the Order of the Frier Minors began on that day, becauſe, ſay they, this word Order, ſignifieth no other thing, but a congregation of certaine perſonnes vnited together.As alſo Brother Peter Catanio. The S. with his two diſciples departed from Aſsiſium, and went into a ſolitary place, where he laboured to inſtruct them, and to exerciſe them in pouerty, humility and prayer, the true and ſolid ground worckes and foundations of Religious.
               
               
                  
                  How Brother Giles was the third diſciple of S. Francis, then other foures and of the reuelation which S. Francis had, that his, and his diſciples ſinnes were pardoned, and that his Order should augment to a great nomber.
                  THE IX. CHAPTER.
                  THeſe tow diſciples were tripled by an other of Aſsiſium named Giles, who was not in the towne, when Bernard and the Canon ſold their ſubſtance, and diſtributed the ſame to the poore to follow S. Francis: But att his retourne vnderſtanding by his parentes and kinred, the reſolution of thoſe his two freindes who gaue an amazement to each one, he reſolued alſo to aſſociate himſelf vnto them in the ſeruice of God: and to this effect he left his kinred, andGiles miraculouſly findeth S. Fran. not knowing where S. Francis then was, falling on his knees he moſt affectionately prayed God to fauour him ſo much as that he might finde him. A litle after which prayer, he miraculously arriued in short time where thoſe three great and true contemners of the world were. As ſoone as S. Francis ſaw him, he was ready to embrace him; but Giles falling to the ground, and reputing himſelf vnworthy of ſuch a fauour, beſought him with abondance of teares, to fauour him ſo much as to admitt him into his ſociety. The holy Father ſeeing the humility, the faith, and deuotion of a man ſo note-worthy, ſaid vnto him: My deerly-beloued Brother, acknowledge the great mercy which God ſheweth you, to receiue you this day for his ſeruant. Then he comforted him, and exhorted him to perſeuer in the vocation whervnto God had called him: And conducting him to his compagnions, he ſaid vnto them: Our God hath this day giuen vs a good Brother. They then very affectionatly and deſiredly embraced him, reioycing together with him att the ſecure acquiſition and election of the good which he had made: Then they went together to prayer, and next to dinner: afterward S. Francis called Giles vnto him to take him with him to Aſsiſium to gett an habitt: in the way they chaunced to meet a very poore woman that asked them an almoſe. S. Francis hauing nothing to giue her, tourned to Giles and ſaid: Brother giue your cloake to this poore woman, for the loue of God; and he with ſo ready a wil obeyed, that he ſeemed to ſee that almoſe to aſcend vnto heauen, ſo great was the contentmentHe receiued afterward he conceiued therin. Now eight dayes after the foreſaid two had taken the habitt, which was S. Georges day, Giles alſo receiued the ſame, hauing firſt diſtributed his goodes to the poore, and ſo the third place

was poſſeſſed by this man of God, worthy of glorious memory, famousthe habit of the Order of S. Fran. and renowrned by the exerciſe of his vertues (as S. Francis foretold.) And albeit he was of nature very ſimple, and had not ſtudyed, he was notwithſtanding ſo eleuated to the ſublimity of moſt high contemplation, that one might truely affirme of him, that he led a life more Angelicall then humane, as in his hiſtory we ſhall recount. The holy Ghoſt a litle after ſent foure other diſciples vnto S. Francis,Foure other are receiued into the ſaid Order. ſo that they were ſeauen in nomber, and yet but one in will. Now to giue a beginning to ſome deuotion, S. Francis ordayned that to each Canonicall hou

                     e of the ſeruice of our Lord (excepte the maſle,) they ſhould ſay thrice the Pater noſter. Brother Giles ſaid, that the reaſon why S. Francis ordayned ſo ſhort a prayer, was, becauſe he would not haue their deuotion reſtrayned by the obligation of their conſtitutions: but that the prayers and ſeruices of each one, ſhould proceed of the feruour of deuotion. S. Francis thus liuing with his companions in continuall prayer and abſtinence in that hermitage, being one day retired into a place a part, and very remote from his diſciples to offer his prayer and bitterly to lament his former life (which had not bin without offence againſt God) and demaunding pardō of the ſoueraigne God, not only for himſelfe, but for his companions alſo, he was filled with an vnſpeakcable contentment by the holy Ghoſt, who aſſured him that his prayers were heard; and affirmed that the infinite bounty had graunted to him and to all his diſciples, a plenary indulgence and remiſſion of all their ſinnes euen to the vtmoſt minute. And immediatly in faith and confirmation hereof he was rauiſhed and abſo
                        •
                     pt with a merueillous light and knowledge, which opening his ſpiritt gaue him clearly to vnderſtand what God had wrought in him and in all his. Hauing then thus knowne the diuine will, he ſought to encourage his ſimple company, telling them that they ſhould not be deiected in regard of their ſmall nomber, but ſhould proceed in hope: becauſe, as the diuine Maieſty had reuealed vnto him, they ſhould multiply in great nomber, and ſhould performe great matters in the world, notwithſtanding their, and his owne ſimplicity; and ſhould after poſſeſſe the eternall kingdome in the next: with which wordes all his Brethren were exceedingly comforted.
               
               
                  
                  How S. Francis began to ſend his Religious ouer the world: what ſucceeded them in the way, and how they were miraculouſly reunited.
                  THE X. CHAPTER.
                  VNitie ioined it ſelfe to the nomber of ſeauen, which ſigniſieth perfection, to demonſtrate euen exteriourly, how well theſe new champions of IESVS CHRIST were vnited in charity: this was an other that tooke the habitt of S. Francis, whoſe name with the others ſhal hereafter be recorded; ſo that they were now eight with the S. who, as a pious Father, hauing aſſembled them, diſcourſed vnto them of the kingdome of God, of contempt of the world, of the abnegation of their proper will, and of mortification of their owne fleſh: then he diſcouered vnto them that his intention was they ſhould diuide themſelues, and trauell ouer the foure quarters of the world, becauſe, not content with that litle nomber, which then his poore and ſterile ſimplicity had regenerated in God, he deſired alſo to renew the birth of al Chriſtians, inducing them to contrition and teares of repentance. He therfore enioyned his deere Religious children, to prepare them ſelues to goe to denounce and publiſh peace to men, &amp; to preach vnto them penance, to obtaine remiſsion of their ſinnes: which he didThat the Frier Minors ought to be trauailling ouer the world. in theſe wordes: Be you patient in ſupporting iniuryes, vigilant and aſsiduous in prayer, couragious in trauailes, modeſt in your ſpeches, graue in your deportmentes, and thanckfull for the grace and fauours which you ſhall receiue. Theſe deerly beloued diſciples vnderſtanding his holy aduertiſmentes, being repleniſhed with the holy ghoſt, and deſirous to obey their Paſtour, eſpecially where it concerned the ſaluation of Chriſtian ſoules, coupled themſelues two together, and fell all ſeauen at the feet of the S. whome they honoured as their true father, and demanded his benediction. But cauſing them to ariſe, he embraced them with a fatherly charity: then gaue them the benediction of the father of mercies: vſing to each of them thoſe wordes of the Prophett Dauid: Caſt your care
                     
                        Pſal. 54. 
                     on our Lord, and he will prouide for you. He accuſtomed to vſe this ſpeech to all the Religious that he ſent vnder obedience. And knowing well that he was to ſerue for patterne and good example to the world, to doe that firſt which he intended to teach; he tooke for companion one of the ſeauen Religious: and then tooke leaue of the reſt, hauing yet precedētly diuided thē in forme of a croſſe: that is, ſending two of thē towardes the eaſt, two towardes the weſt, two towardes the ſouth, and two towards the north, each one went with his companion on his way, rich &amp; wel

cloathed with diuine grace: but with habitts torne, patched &amp; tuſſed vp, bare-foote, and as it were all naked &amp; deſtitute of all tēporall prouiſiōs: preaching thorough the world, more by worckes then by word, giuing example of humility, patience, and pouerty. They wanted no laborious accidentes, being afflicted in many places, and in diuers maners. For ofWhat the good Religious endured in this firſt obedience. that which we find recorded of two, we may collect the exerciſes of the reſt. The Weſt was alloted vnto Brother Quintaualle, who being with his companion arriued att Florence, and not finding where to lodge, the night being come, they ſetled them ſelues againſt a wall, vnder a penthouſe, the maſter whereof refuſing to lodge thē by reaſon of the ſtrange faſhion of their habitt, fearing that they were ſome lewd perſonnes and theeues, they all the night endured much cold, yea in great extremity in regard of the ſharpnes of the ſeaſon: neuertheles they continually prayled God: In the morning they went very early to maſſe, praying with deuotion. Now the miſtreſſe of the houſe vnder whoſe roufe they had slept the night, being preſent att that maſſe, knew them to be thoſe whome neither her husbād nor her ſelfe would entertaine for a nightes lodgeing. She then ſaid to her ſelfe: Theſe men doubtles are no theeues as my husband did coniecture, for they ſeeme to be holy perſonnes. Theſe Religious in the meane time were beheld of each one for the nouelty of their habitt, but much more when they refuſed the mony which one preſent offered them for an almoſe. Eor therby were they knowne to be voluntarily poore for the loue of IESVS CHRIST. And therfore the man and woman that before refuſed to entertaine thē, by prayers conducted them to their houſe, by whome they were exceedingly edified, as wel by example of their life, as by the pious and heauenly diſcourſes wherwith they induced them to haue care of their ſoules. Thus did theſe Religious paſſe Florence: The inconuenience of the night which they endured was litle in regard of that which befell them afterward: for both in reſpect of the ſtrange forme of their habitt, and for the auſterity of their life, they were moſt commonly iniuried and buffeted, becauſe almoſt euery one treated thē as ſenceles or diſtracted perſonnes. Some gaue them tātes and mockes, others caſt dirt att them, ſome pulled them by the cappuce, others cauſed children with clamours to follow them. Theſe iniuries were not only procured them by the malice of idle perſonnes, but alſo by the ſubtilty and inducement of the diuill, who thought by theſe ignominies to terrifie them, and make them deſiſt from theire holy reſolution. But they being armed with the grace and patience of IESVS CHRIST, did not, only ſupport the extremity of hunger, cold, and diſgraces, but euen did not by any exteriour ſigne appeare to be moued withall.

So farre alſo were they from replying to them that abuſed them, that receiuing their perſecutions as a great fauour, they ordinarily prayed to God for them: in ſuch ſort that theſe remonſtrances of patience and charity hauing bin by certaine weighed and conſidered, their vertue and ſanctity did conſequently appeare. They therfore repenting to haue offended them, repayred vnto them as to holy perſonnages humbly to require pardon: vertue being of ſuch force and efficacie, that albeit for a time it be reſiſted and contemned, yet in the end it doth alwayes conquere and triumph ouer the enemies therof. Some certaine time being ſpent after the ſeparation of theſe good Religious, their compaſsionate Father being vnable any longer to endure and ſupport this irckſome abſence: had a vehement deſire to recollect his deerly beloued children:S. Fran. obtameth of God ſpeed
                           •
                        ly to ſee his Religious ſo far remote one from an other. But the difference and diſtance of the places where they were being ſuch as it could not be don but by the diuine prouidence, the ſainct fell to his deuotion, and prayed God that, as he had ſormerly aſſembled certaine Iſraelites very diſtantly ſeparated and diſpearced, ſo he would alſo now vouch-ſafe to vnite and aſſemble his deerly beloued Brethren. After a ſhort time he miraculously knew the approbation of his prayer: for without any humane dilligence or induſtry, they were all, as S. Francis had deſired preſent in one very place: which was not without an exceeding aſtoniſhment vnto his Brethren, who admired the diuine prouidence. The holy Father entertained his children with incredible ioy: they then began among them ſelues to recount what they had endured in their trauaile, and what was the fruit of their labours amongſt the faithfull Chriſtians. Thus did theſe new Apoſtles in very ſhort time beginne to exerciſe thē ſelues in the ſeruice of God, by the footeſteppes of his holy diſciples. About that time, four other honorable gentlemen did adhere vnto them, ſo that they were eleuen, whoſe names were theſe: Brother Bernard Quintaualle, Brother Peter Catanio, Br. Giles of Aſsiſium, Br. Sabadin, Br. Morigo the leſſe, Br. Iohn Capelle, Brother Phillip the long, Br. Iohn of S. Conſtant, Br. Barbarus, Br. Bernard of Veridant, and Br. Angelus Tancredas of Riete.
               
               
                  Of the firſt rule that S. Francis ordained.
                  THE XI. CHAPTER.
                  S. Francis perceiuing his diſciples to aproach to the Apoſtolicall nomber, began to write downe the forme and rule of life which they ſhould obſerue, wherto for foundatiō he gaue the obſeruance of the goſpell, therto adding certaine other pointes neceſſary for ſuch as

liue in Congregation, and this to the end the profeſſours of his rule ſhould not vary and differ in any thing from the intention and will of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, as well in his Preceptes as Councels: which rule is this enſuying, hauing ſince that time bin augmented by S. Francis, as in his proper place ſhal appeare.

                                 THe life and rule of the Frier Minors is thus; That they liue chaſtly vnder holy obedience, and not poſſeſsing any thing in propriety: That they follow the life and doctrine of IESVS
                                       Matt. 19. Matt. 16. Luc. 14. Matt. 19. CHRIST who ſayeth: If thou deſireſt to be perfect goe, and ſell what thou haſt, and giue it to the poore, for doeing ſo thou ſhalt purchaſe treaſure in heauen: If any man deſire to come after me, lett him renounce his proper will, lett him take vp his croſſe and follow me: and he that will come after me, and forſaketh not father, mother, wife, children, and hateth not himſelfe for my loue, cannot be my diſciple. Beſides; whoſoeuer ſhall forſake Father, mother, brothers and ſiſters, wiues, children, and all his earthly ſubſtance for my loue, ſhall receiue an hundred fold, and purchaſe eternall life.
                              
                              
                                 
                                 Of the manner of admitting the Brethren into the Order; and of cloathing them, and of the habit of the Frier Minors.
                                 THE II. CHAPTER.
                                 VVHen any one by diuine inſpiration ſhalbe diſpoſed to enter into this Religion, lett him be benignely receiued by the Superiour of the Brethren: and hauing proued him to be ſtable in this purpoſe, lett him ſend him to his Miniſter Prouinciall: and lett the Brethren in the meane while be wary not to entermedle in any ſort with their worldly affaires. Now he being preſented to the Prouinciall (who ſhall graciously entertaine him) after he ſhall haue diligently examined his will, and the cauſe inducing him to deſire his entrance into this Religion, lett him ſeriously expoſe vnto him the manner of life of the Brethren. Which don, he ought by pregnant perſuaſions to exhort him, without lawfull impediment to ſell all his ſubſtance, before he diſpoſe of his life, and lett him giue it to the poore, if he thincke good; but lett the Brethren Miniſters be very reſpectiue that in treating this matter, they doe not perſuade or induce him in any ſort whatſoeuer to giue any mony to themſelues or to their Couent: Neuertheles if perhappes the Couent or the Brethren haue need of any thing that he hath, and he offering it, and deſiring of himſelfe to giue it, they may receiue it, as if he diſtributed it in almoſe to any other poore, and no otherwiſe, prouided yet that this gift be not mony. This being performed, I meane his ſubſtance being diſtributed to the poore, or as God ſhall inſpire him, and returning to the Couent, the Miniſter Prouinciall ſhall then giue him the habitt of probation,The capperon is a peece of cloth which the nouices weare on their brests from the neck to the cord. which he ſhall weare one yeare. This habitt ſhalbe ſuch: two coates without cappuce, and the corde: And the yeare of probation ended, his profeſsion ſhalbe procured, and when he ſhall haue ſubmitted himſelfe to holy obedience, he may not be permitted to enter into any other Religion, nor to be diſobedient to the Pope. And if there be any, that for ſome lawfull impediment, cannot diſtribute his ſubſtance for the loue of God, it ſhall ſuffice that he renounce and abandon it, in whatſoeuer other manner. Lett it not be permitted that any be receiued againſt the ordonnance and conſtitutions of the Church. All thoſe that haue promiſed obedience, muſt haue one coate with the cappuce, and an other without it, if it be needfull, and a corde to gird him, and the linnen breeches. All the Brethren muſt be cloathed with courſe cloth, and they may pach it with ſack cloth and other rude peices, becauſe our

Lord ſaith in the goſpell: They that are clothed ſumptuously, dwell in the Courtes of Princes: for, though they be called hypocrites, lett them
                                       Matt. 11. not yet omitt to doe that which they ought for the ſeruice of his diuine maieſty, &amp; for the ſaluation of their ſoules, &amp; lett thē not in this world ſeek precious garmentes, that they may hereafter find better in heauen.
                              
                              
                                 Of the diuine ſeruice, and of faſting.
                                 THE III. CHAPTER.
                                 ANd becauſe our Lord in one place ſaith: This kinde of deuill cannot be caſt out but by vertue of faſt and prayer. And in an other:

They may poſſeſſe bookes neceſſary for their diuine ſeruice. The lay Brothers that can read, may haue a Pſalter, but they that cannot read, may not haue nor keep any bookes: but lett them euery day for their mattins ſay the Credo, with twenty fiue Pater noſters and Gloria Patri, &amp; ſo much, att the third, ſixt, and ninth houre; att Euenſong the Credo and twelue Pater noſters, att Complin, the Credo, with ſeauen Pater noſters and the Requiem aeternam; then for the defectes and negligences of the Brethren, euery day three Pater nosters. Al the Brethren as well Clerkes as the lay, shalbe obliged to faſt from Alſainctes to Chriſtmas, and from the Epiphanie, when our Lord IESVS CHRIST began to faſt, vntill Eaſter: Att other times, they shall not be bound to faſt by this rule; the fridayes excepted they may indifferently eat of all meates that shalbe giuen them, according to the permiſsion of the Ghoſpell, and

                                 How the Ministers ought to gouerne themſelues in diſpencing with the Religious concerning their obedience.
                                 THE IV. CHAPTER.
                                 IN the name of God, al the Brethren that are elected miniſters, &amp; are ſeruantes to the other Brethren, ought to appoint the places &amp; Couentes where they shal iudge moſt conuenient to dwel: they muſt often viſit thē, &amp; admonish them to obſerue &amp; accōplish their profeſsiō
                                    
promiſe, vow, and oath: and lett them ſpiritually conſtraine them to ſatisfie this obligation: and lett all my other bleſſed Brethren humbly and diligently obey them in whatſoeuer shall concerne their ſaluation, and ſhal not be contrary to this rule: and lett them liue together with ſuch charity that they proceed not againſt the word of God, where he ſaith:
                                       Matt. 20. Doe vnto men that which you would haue men doe vnto you, and doe not that which you would not they ſhould doe to you, Lett the Miniſters and ſeruantes, remember that which our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST ſaith: I am not come to be ſerued, but to ſerue: ſo that the ſoules of the Brethren being giuen them in chardge, they ought to
                                       Hebr. 13. haue a very reſpectiue care of them, that none doe periſh by their fault and euill example, and that they render not account for them to God, att the terrible iudgment.
                              
                              
                                 Of fraternall correction in offences: that the Ministers ought not to giue ſcandale, and that they may not haue dominion of any thing.
                                 THE V. CHAPTER.
                                 
                                    
                                       Hebr. 10. YOu that are Miniſters, haue a ſpeciall guard and care of your ſoules, and of thoſe of your Brethren: For it is a very terrible and fearfull thing to fall into the handes of the liung God, moued to anger. And if any of you, command the Brethren any thing, againſt the rule and this forme of life, or againſt conſcience, know yee that if he doe it not, he is not obliged vnder obedience. Lett all the Brethren that are ſubiect to the Miniſter, the ſeruant of his Brethren, obſerue his actiōs with great dilligence and conſideration. And if they perceiue any of their Miniſters to proceed according to the fleſh, not according to the ſpiritt, or our rule, if he amend not after the firſt admonition or correction, lett him be notified vnto the Father Generall, and the ſeruant of this confraternity, as incorrigible, at the Chapter of Penticoſt, without contradiction or delay. If among the Brethren where they ſhall liue, there be any that will not proceed according to the ſpiritt, and our profeſsion, let the Brethren in whoſe company they ſhall be, admoniſh, aduiſe, and with humility mildly reprehend him, euen to the third time: But if after the third admonition he do not amend, lett them informe the Miniſter Prouinciall, or bring him to his preſence with the firſt opportunity: And the ſaid Miniſter ſhall proceed therin as God ſhall inſpire him. Lett all the Brethren, as well Miniſters, ſeruantes, as others be very reſpectiue not to be angry, paſsionate, or troubled for the ſinne or euell example of the other Brethrē: For the deuill ſeeketh no other thing

but to damne many, by the ſinne of one; but lett thē conſider how they may ſpiritually aſsiſt him, becauſe they that are in health need not a Phiſition,Note this word. Matt. 9. Luc. 12.
                                     but they that are diſeaſed. It is prohibited to all the Brethren and Miniſters of this Order, to be capable of enioying poſſeſsions, dominion or ſeignurie; for, as our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST ſaith: The Princes of the world, haue commaund ouer them: lett vs be carefull that it be not ſo among vs; but he that ſeeketh and deſireth to be greateſt, lett him be the leaſt, and ſeruant to all others. Lett not any Brother doe or ſpeake euill of an other: but lett them reciprocally ſerue and obey each other, with a ſpirituall charity of the ſpiritt, according as their neceſsity ſhal require; for that is the holy and true obedience of our Lord IESVS CHRIST. And lett all the Brethren, of what degree ſoeuer they be, know, that if they erre from the preceptes of God, and are diſobedient as the Prophett ſaith, they are accurſed for their ſinne whiles they are

                                 THe Brethren that ſhall not be able to obſerue our forme of life in the places whither they ſhall be ſent, lett them as ſoone as they can, haue recourſe to their Miniſter Prouinciall, and lett them enforme him of their neceſsity. The Miniſter Prouinciall, ſhal then endeauour to prouide for them, and ſhall doe what in the like accident he would ſhould be done to him. Lett not any Brother be called Priour: but lett all generally with one accord be called Brothers, and when there ſhalbe need, lett on waſh an others feet, to exerciſe humility.

                                 IN what place ſoeuer any of the Brethren ſhall reſide, for the ſeruice of others, they ſhall not vndertake the offices of men of the Chamber

to be keeper or diſpoſer of the wine or victuall prouiſion, nor in any ſore accept of other chardg in the houſe where they ſhal dwel: to the end they neither breed nor procure ſcandal or detriment to their ſoules: but lett them be inferiour and ſubiect to all that ſhalbe in the ſaid houſe. And the Brethren that shalbe fitt to labour and performe any thing, lett them be employed in the art and exerciſe they know, prouided that it be not contrary

Becauſe thou ſhalt eat of the labours of thy handes, thou ſhalt be bleſſed: and the Apoſtle alſo: he that wil not work, let him not eat. Lett each one therfore with charity exerciſe the art and office wherin he ſhalbe employed, and for recompence of the manuall worckes they ſhall doe, they may receiue thinges neceſſary to their life, prouided that it be not mony: and if any thing be further needfull vnto them, lett them demaund it in almoſe as other poore people doe. It ſhalbe permitted them to poſſeſſe inſtrumentes and tooles neceſſary to the trade and art wherin they are skilfull:S. Hier. But lett all the brethren be reſpectiue to be euer employed in ſome good and commendable art, becauſe it is written. That a man ought to be alwayes buſied in ſome good worck, that if the deuill come to tempt him, he finde him well employed. And in an other place it is ſaid, that idlenes is a capitall ennemie to the ſoule, and therfore the true ſeruantes of God ought to be exerciſed in prayer or in ſome other good worcke. Lett the Religious be very carefull not to appropriatt to themſelues any place where they ſhall dwell, or any other, be it an hermitage, or whatſoeuer other place, nor lett them maintaine it as theirs, and if any come to viſitt them, be it freind, ennemy, theefe, or murderer, lett them graciously receiue him. When the ſaid Brethren ſhall dwel neere one to an other, lett them often charitably viſitt each other, and lett them ſpiritually honour one an other without any murmure, but lett them be ioyfull and content in our Lord, lett them with modeſty ſhew themſelues gracious exteriourly and interiourly.

                                 THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                                 GOd gaue this commandement to his Apoſtles: Be you intentiue and keepe your ſelues from all kinde of malice and auarice, as alſo from ſetling your thoughtes and affections on this life, and being ouer carefull to purchaſe the things of the world. And therfore no Brother in whatſoeuer place he be, either to make his reſidence, or

to trauaile, or for any other occaſion whatſoeuer, may haue mony in any manner or faſhion that can happen, nor leſſe may he receiue it for recompence of his labours; breiflely, no Brother may touch or poſſeſſe mony for any neceſsity that may befall him, vnleſſe it be to releiue the vrgent need of the ſick Brethren: becauſe we muſt no more eſteeme mony, then ſtones or thornes; to the end that, ſith we renounce and abandon all our temporall ſubſtance in this life, we doe not afterward for ſo ſmall a matter make ſhipwrack of the eternall kingdome. If peraduenture we chaunce to finde mony in ſom place, lett vs no more regard then durt: becauſe whatſoeuer is in the world, is meere vanity. But if it ſhould happē, which God forbid, that any brother receiue mony, excepting vpon the aforeſaid neceſsity of the ſicke, lett him be reputed by the Confraternity, for a falſe Religious, and thefe, as he that taketh a purſe, if he be not truely penitent. Lett not the Brethren in any manner in the world receiue mony or cauſe it to be receiued, nor much leſſe lett them demaund or procure it to be demaunded by a third perſon in any ſort whatſoeuer, nor lett them goe in company of men that demaund it for them. But the Brethren may, in the houſes and places whither they ſhall goe, exerciſe other ſeruices that ſhall not be contrarie to our Religion and rule, with the benediction of our Lord. They may demaund almoſe, for the leapers only, whome they know to be in great neceſsity; but lett them be very wary of mony, and lett them likewiſe take keed not to ſearch the world, for any occaſion of vnlawfull gaine that may be preſented.
                              
                              
                                 Of the manner of demaunding almoſe, and of their ordinarie diet and refection.
                                 THE IX. CHAPTER.
                                 LEtt all the Brethren laboure to imitate the pouetty and humility of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST: and lett them remember that nothing is neceſſary in the world, but, as the Apoſtle ſaith, to haue wherewithal to releiue and couer vs: wherwith we ought to content vs, and ſeek no more. We muſt reioyce when we conuerſe with poore and baſe perſonnes, that are contemned of the world, but eſpecially with the diſeaſed, leapers, and poore begars thorough the ſtreetes. Whē it ſhable neceſſary to goe to demaūd almoſe att the doores, lett thē goe without any feare or shame, calling to minde that the ſonne of Almighty God, preſented his countenance as a hard ſtone to the blowes and affrontes of the world, and he was nothing

aſhamed, to be poore and a ſtranger, and to liue vpon almoſe, together with his moſt ſacred mother the virgin Mary. And if men deny almoſe, and retourne diſgraces to the brother that ſhall demaund it, lett him thanck God ſor it, and pray for them: becauſe he ſhall receiue, ſaith IESVS CHRIST, great honour, of the ſhame that men ſhall procure him, and lett him know, that the iniuryes and ſcornes which ſhalbe don him, ſhall not be imputed as a fault to him that ſhall receiue them, but to him indeed that ſhall offer them: likewiſe that almoſe is a rent and obligation due to the poore, which our Lord IESVS CHRIST hath merited, purchaced and left vnto vs. And the Brethren that trauaile in ſeeking almoſe, ſhall haue great recompence therof, beſides that they procure a meritt to them that giue it; for whatſoeuer men doe in this world ſhall diſſolue to nothinge, excepting almoſe, and worckes don in charity, for which they ſhall receiue of God an eternall recompence. Lett each Brother with all aſſurance diſcouer his neceſsity to his fellowes, that they may comfort him with good wordes, and actually aſsiſt him according to their abillity: and lett each of them loue and cheriſh his Brothers, as the mother loueth and cheriſheth her owne child, in what God ſhall giue him grace and faculty, to aſsiſt him. He that eateth not, lett him not contemne him that eateth; and he that eateth, lett him not the more eſteeme of him that eateth not. If any neceſsity happen, it ſhalbe permiſſable to all the Brethren where they ſhall reſide, to eat of all humane thinges, as God ſaid of Dauid, who did eat the bread that was permitted to Preiſtes only to eat. Lett the Brethren remember that which IESVS CHRIST ſaith: Beware of chardging and ouerburdening your hart with two much drincking &amp; eating, for feare that sleepe incontinently ſurpriſe you, and that sloath be occaſion that in the latter day you be intercepted in the ſnares of death; the which before the entrapping of each man liuing ſhall neuertheles haue diuerſes effectes, according as they ſhall finde the ſoule diſpoſed, either to life or to death, the one and the other eternall. But in time of manifeſt neceſsity, lett the Brethren behaue themſelues as their need ſhal import, as our Lord ſhall better inſtruct them, becauſe neceſsity is not ſubiect to law.
                              
                              
                                 In what manner the ſick Brethren ought to be ſerued.
                                 THE X. CHAPTER.
                                 IN any place where a Brother ſhall fall ſicke, lett him not be left alone, but lett there be alwaies one or more, if need require to ſerue him, as

they would deſire to be if they were in his place: if vpō neceſsity there be no Brother, lett care be taken to leaue ſome charitable perſō to attēd and ſerue him in his ſicknes: and I pray the ſick Brother, that what ſoeuer may happen vnto him, he alwayes giue thancks vnto God, and be content to be ſuch as God would haue him to be, either aliue or dead: that he continue in ſicknes or recouer his health: becauſe all they whome God hath predeſtinated to eternall life, are ordinarily by him inſtructed and diciplined, with the rod of his afflictions and ſickneſſe, with a ſpiritt of compunction and bitternes, as he ſaith in the third of the Apocalipſe; I chaſtice and correct him whome I Ioue. And if the ſicke be diſquieted and paſsionat againſt God or the Brethren, or haue an ouer greedy affection to phiſicke, deſiring and procuring beyond reaſon, to free his ffeſh which hath ſo litle time to liue, and the which is ennemy to the ſoule; the ſaid ſick Brother muſt not eſteeme the ſame to proceed of a good ground, but lett him aſſure and repute himſelfe to be carnall: for he doth not ſeeme to be of the nomber of the true ſeruantes of God, ſith he more affecteth the body then the ſoule, conſidering that he ſtriueth to worck more therin, then the Phiſition findeth for his cure.
                              
                              
                                 That the Brethren ought mutually to loue each other, that they ought not to calumniat any perſon, nor in any ſort to murmure.
                                 THE XI. CHAPTER.
                                 LEtt the Brethren be wary not to accuſe any of malice or to calumniat him, and lett them not be contentious among themſelues or with others, lett them alſo ſhunne perfidiouſnes and disloyalty, but lett them be carefull to performe their exerciſes in the grace of God with ſilence, and lett them not maintaine quarelſome diſputes, neither among them ſelues nor with others: but rather that they firſt yeld, and ſay: We are vnprofitable ſeruantes, anſwearing alwayes with humility, and being very carefull of growing into paſsion: For men that maintaine their choller againſt their neighbour, are obliged to render account therof att the iudgement of God: and he that ſhall vpbraid his neighbour with contemptible wordes, ſhalbe condemned to the fire of hell. Lett them therfore loue one an other, as our lord teacheth vs, when he ſaith: My children, this is the precept I giue you, that you loue one an other, as I haue loued you. Now the trueſt manner of mutuall loue, according to the Apoſtle, is knowne by wordes, by worckes, and in verity. Lett them not curſe any perſonne, lett

them not murmure, nor lett them not ſpeake ill of any, for it is written: The murmurers and detracters are abhorred of God. Lett them be modeſt, ſhewing themſelues gentle and tractable to all, not iudging nor condemning any man; and, as our lord ſaith, conſider not the litle ſinnes of others, but rather with a bitternes and contrition of your ſoule obſerue your owne, and endeauour to enter by the ſtreight gate, becauſe our lord ſaith, the way is ſtreight, as alſo is the gate that giueth▪ entry to eternall life, and there are few that finde it and enter theratt.
                              
                              
                                 That the Brethren ought to be wary not to behould nor conuerſe with women.
                                 THE XII. CHAPTER.
                                 LEtt all the Brethren in whatſoeuer place they reſide, very reſpectiuely forbeare wanton laſciuious aſpectes, and lewd and dangerous conuerſations with women. When it ſhalbe neceſſary, lett none preſume to ſpeake alone with a woman, excepting the Preiſtes, who may ſpeake modeſtly vnto them, when they giue them any penance or any ſpirituall counſaile, and lett no woman, in what ſoeuer manner, be receiued to obedience by any Brother what ſoeuer, to whome it ſhalbe yet permitted to counſaile her ſpiritually, to doe penance where ſhe will. And lett vs all carefully preſerue ourſelues, with exceeding warines and dilligence; for God hath ſaid, that what man ſoeuer ſhall behold a woman to couett her, he hath already ſinned withher in his hart, becauſe it is not lawfull for vs to behold that, which is not lawfull for vs to deſire.
                              
                              
                                 Of the punishment of the Brethren that shall fall into the ſinne of the flesh.
                                 THE XIII. CHAPTER.
                                 IF any Brother, by inſtigation of the deuill, committ the ſinne of the fleſh, lett him vtterly looſe and be depriued of the habit, which by his offence and lewdnes he ſhall haue defiled, and wher of by his finne he ſhall haue depriued himſelfe: lett him be vtterly expelled the Religion, and let: him goe to doe penance for his ſinne.

                                 THE XIIII. CHAPTER.
                                 VVHen the Brethren thall trauaile through the world, they muſt not, nor may not carry any kind of prouiſion, nor wallet, purſe, mony, nor ſtaffe, and into what ſoeuer houſes they ſhall enter, they ſhall ſay: The peace of our lord be in this houſe, and being entertained in any place, they may there repoſe, and eat and drincke of what ſhalbe preſented vnto them. And if they shall be abuſed in wordes or effectes, by any one, lett them not be moued therwith, yea if one should giue them a buffet on the one cheek, lett them tourne the other; if any one would diſapparell them, lett thē not hinder it, yea if one should violētly robbe them of their coat, lett them not aske it againe, but lett them beleeue that all this arriueth vnto them by the prouidence of God.
                              
                              
                                 That the Religious may not haue any horſes.
                                 THE XV. CHAPTER.
                                 I Command all my Brethren, aſwell Preiſtes as lay, that when they shall trauaile thorough the world, or shall reſide in any place, they haue no kind of beaſt to ride on, neither for them ſelues, nor for others, nor that it be euer lawfull for them to ride on horſe-backe, but in caſe of ſicknes, or of manifeſt neceſsity.
                              
                              
                                 Of them that shall goe to the Mores and Infidels.
                                 THE XVI. CHAPTER.
                                 
                                    
                                       Matt. 10. OVr lord ſaith: Behold I ſend you as sheep in the middes of wolues. Be ye therfore wiſe as ſerpentes, and ſimple as doues. And if any Brother moued with a diuine inſpiration, would goe among the infidell Mores, he may not goe without licēce of his Miniſter Prouinciall, who knowing that Religious ſufficient, and of ſuch a ſpiritt, that therof one may hope ſome fruit to redounde to others (not only ſaluation to himſelfe) let him not be denyed, all vnderſtood with the aſsiſtāce of God. For the ſaid Miniſter Prouinciall shalbe obliged to be accountable vnto God, if graunting, or refuſing permiſsiō to the faid Brother, his reſolutiō shalbe pious, or indiſcreet. And the Brethren that shall goe among

the infidels, may in two manners conuerſe with them: Firſt, they may not contentiously impugne them, but lett them be ſubiect, not only to the ſaid infidels, but to euery creature for the loue of God, yet confeſsing themſelues alwayes to be Chriſtians. Secondly, that when they perceiue it to be the will of God, they preach his word, to the end they beleeue in him one ſoueraigne power, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, on God in Trinity, and in the humanity of the Redeemer and Sauiour of the world, exhorting them to be baptiſed and to liue
                                       Ioan. 3. thence-foward in Chriſtianity: becauſe he that ſhall not be borne againe by Baptiſme and the holy Ghoſt, cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen. They ſhall preach to the Infidell people theſe thinges, and many others, which God ſhall inſpire them: For our lord ſaid in the goſpell: I will confeſſe before my Father which is in heauen, all thoſe that ſhall confeſſe me before men: but the day when I ſhall come on the earth in the Maieſty of my Father, I will deny them that ſhalbe aſhamed to confeſſe me to be the Sonne of man. Lett all the Brethren, in what ſoeuer place they are, remember that they haue already offered their ſoules and bodies to the ſoueraigne God, and that they ought to expoſe and employe them for the loue of him, in all occurrances, and to preſent the ſame to the ennemies viſible and inuiſible, becauſe our lord hath ſaid: he that in this world ſhall looſe his life for my ſake, ſhall finde it ſafe in eternall life, and bleſſed are they that ſuffer perſecution for iuſtice, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen. Lett them alſo call to
                                       Ioan. 12. Ioh. 5. Matt. 5. minde that which our lord ſaith: If you be perſecuted of the impious and wicked, they haue firſt perſecuted me, and if you be perſecuted in one citty, fly into an other. When men ſhall hate you and perſecute your name and you renowme and ſhall ſpeake all euill of you for my ſake, and for my loue, reioyce yee boldely: for your recompēce therof is great in heauen. And thus much I ſpeake to you (my Brethren) to thēd you ſhould not feare thoſe that haue power to kill the body, and with your patience you ſhall poſſeſſe you ſoules, and he that ſhall perſeuer to the end, ſhalbe ſaued.
                              
                              
                                 Of the Preachers.
                                 THE XVII. CHAPTER.
                                 THe preaching of the goſpell being the food and nouriſhment of the ſoule, lett no Brother or Miniſter authoriſe himſelfe and enterpriſe to preach without licence of his Superiours, and lett ſuch as 
                                       ••
                                    albe authoriſed, be very reſpectiue not to preach againſt the forme and

conſtitutions of our holy mother the Church. Lett the Miniſter Prouincials be aduertiſed not to admitt to any chardge, eſpecially in matter of importance, all perſonnes indifferently, but lett them formerly conſider well therof. Lett the Brethren that ſhalbe admitted to preach, or to exerciſe any other obedience, take heed not to attribute to themſelues, or to their merittes, the office which they ſhall haue, and particulerly that of preaching, they ought rather to practiſe by worckes, then by faire elected wordes: and therfore att all times and whenſoeuer they ſhalbe aduertiſed to deſiſt from preaching, lett them without any contradiction entierly forbeare to preach. Therfore (by charity which is God himſelfe) I pray all my Brethren, Preachers, Oratours, and other Officers and Miniſters, as well Preiſtes as lay, that they endeauour continually to debaſe and humble themſelues, and that they neither glory nor take complacence in any good, that God doeth or ſpeaketh by them: becauſe ſuch worck is not theirs, but Goddes: and that they remember that which our lord IESVS CHRIST ſaith: Eſteeme not the more of your ſelues, for that you ſee the deuils ſubiect vnto you; and lett each on reſt aſſured that we haue nothing of our owne, but vices and ſinnes: and when we finde our ſelues tempted and oppreſſed with diſeaſes and afflictions, as well in ſoule as in body, we ſhould reioyce in hope of eternall life. Lett vs beware of pride, and vaine glory of the wiſdome of the world, and the prudence of the fleſh, which endeauoureth to ſpeake well, but litle to doe well. For it ſeeketh not a religion and ſanctity of ſpiritt, but a religion and ſanctity exteriour and apparant vnto men: for theſe are they of whome our lord ſpeaketh, when he ſaith: I tell you in verity, you haue already your reward. The ſpiritt which is of God, deſireth the fleſh ſhould be mortified,
                                       Matth.

Therfore are all honours, and all benedictions due to him alone, by reaſon alſo that he is the true and ſoueraigne good: And therfore when we ſhall ſee any thing il done or ill ſpoaken againſt his holy name, lett vs on the contrary endeauour to prayſe, exalt, and thanck him, as bleſſed for euer world without end. Amen.

                                 THe Miniſter Prouinciall ought with all his Brethren to aſſemble together, euery yeare, att the feaſt of S. Michael, in ſome cōmodious place to treat and determine of matters behoufull for the ſeruice of God and Religiō. And all the Miniſter Prouincials that are beyond the ſea and in places on the other ſide the Mountaines, shall aſſēble once euery three yeares: the other Miniſter Prouincials shall come euery yeare to the Chapiter, in the Church of S. Mary of Angels, if the Miniſter generall diſpoſe not otherwiſe, to whoſe ordonnance all ought to obey.

                                 LEtt all the Brethren be Catholiques, and as ſuch, liue Catholiquely: and if any one ſhould erre in faith, or in the inſtution and conſtitutions of holy Churche, either by worckes or wordes, if he doe not forthe with rectifie himſelfe, lett him be vtterly expelled out of our Religiō. We ought to acknoledge for our Superiours, all Prelates and Religious in that which concerneth the good eſtate of our ſoule, prouided that they proceed not againſt our Order and our Rule.

                                 LEtt all my Brethren, as well Preiſtes as the laity, the bleſſed of God, cōfeſſe to the Preiſtes of our Order, and if in caſe they cā
                                    not, they may confeſſe to an other Preiſt, that is prudent and Catholique, and lett them firmely beleeue that by the pennance and abſolution giuen them, they ſhalbe abſolued of all their ſinnes: and therfore lett them endeauour, with the greateſt faith and humility that they can, to accompliſh the penance that ſhalbe enioyned them. And if they ſhould be in a place where they could not haue commodity of a Preiſt, lett them in ſuch caſe confeſſe with their Brethren, as the Apoſtle ſaith:
                                       I
                                             ••
                                          . 5. Confeſſe your ſinnes one to an other: But let them not yet omitt, when they ſhall haue meanes to repaire to Preiſtes, becauſe they alone haue the authority and power of God to bind and looſe: Being ſo contrite

and cōfeſted, lett them with exceeding humility and reuerence receiue the moſt ſacred ſacrament, calling to minde that which God ſaith: he
                                       Ioan. 6. Matt. 26. that eateth my fleſh and drincketh my bloud, hath life euerlaſting. And in an other place: Doe this for a commemoration of me.
                              
                              
                                 Of prayſing God and exhorting Christians to pennance.
                                 THE XXI. CHAPTER.
                                 VVHen my Brethren ſhall know and eſteeme it expedient to preach to the people, hauig imparted the benediction of God, they may vſe theſe wordes: Feare, loue, honour, praiſe continually, and ſay yee: Be thou bleſſed almighty God, Trinity, and vnitie, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, Creatour of all thinges: I beſeech thee to permitt me to performe fruites worthy of penance, and to know this truth, that we ſhall ſhortly die, and that att that inſtant the knotte of this ſoule and body shall end, to be either eternally happy, or eternally miſerable. They muſt exhort ſuch as haue bin offended, to pardon, as God doth pardon vs: and to this effect lett them vnderſtand, that if they doe not pardon, they shall not be pardonned, and that they shalbe bleſſed that shall die contrite, becauſe their place shalbe in heauen, and miſerable shall they be that shall die impenitent, becauſe they shalbe children of the deuill, whoſe worckes they haue wrought, and therfore shall they diſcend into eternall ſier. Be carefull my beloued Brethren to shunne all vices, and perſeuer in god euen to the end, that God may bleſſe you.
                              
                              
                                 An Exhortation he made to all the Brethren.
                                 THE XXII. CHAPTER.
                                 
                                    
                                       Matth. 5. LEtt vs be mindefull of that which our lord ſayth; loue your enemies, and doe good to them that hate you: Becauſe beſides what he hath taugbt vs by worde, he hath in like ſort taught vs by effect, whoſe ſteppes we ought to imitate. As then he called Iudas his freind, though he knew he would betray him, and voluntarily preſented himſelfe to them that were to crucifie him: ſo likewiſe lett vs repute them our freindes that iniuſtly afflict vs, that oppoſe them ſelues againſt vs, that iniury vs, procure our vexation, torment and death: and we ought to loue them the more, in that what they doe vnto vs, God vſeth them as an inſtrument: and becauſe what ſoeeuer he doeth and permitteth, though it ſeeme

diſpleaſing vnto vs, it notwithſtanding auaileth to our ſaluation, ſith by meane hereof we ſhall purchaſe eternall life. We ought beſides to abhorre and hate our body, when it is pleaſed in delightes and vices: for ſo liuing carnally, we eſtrange our ſelues from the loue of IESVS CHRIST, and make our owne entry into hell; and by reaſon that by ſinne we become loathſome and miſerable, and that the concupiſcences of our fleſh are contrary to our true good, and make vs prone to euill, as our lord ſaith. From the hart of man proceed euill cogitations,
                                       Matt. 15. fornications, adulteries, murders, couetouſnes, theftes, deceiptes, blaſphemies, falſe teſtimonies, pride, and the foly of this world, and all the foreſaid euils procure and make the ſoule loathſome, defiled, and refrigerate: we therfore, who haue already forſaken the world, ſhould haue regard to no other thinge, but to doe the will of God, an to take contentment therin. Lett vs haue care not to be like the earth by the way ſide full of ſtones and thornes, becauſe as our lord
                                       Luc. 8. ſaith, the ſeed (that is the word of God) which was ſowne by the way ſide, was trodden vnder foote by paſſengers and deſtroyed. Hereto are compared thoſe that heare the word of God, but diſpoſe not themſelues to vertue, and the deuill incontinently rooteth it out of their harts, leaſt beleeuing they might be ſaued. They are compared to the ſtone, wheron the other ſeed fell, who willingly heare the word of God, and inſome ſort diſpoſe themſelues to doe well: but ſome affliction befalling them, they are incontinently ſcandalized, the ſeed then withereth, becauſe it hath no root. They are compared to thornes, who hearing the word of God, haue their harts alwayes employed on worldly thinges and permitt thēſelues to be ſeduced by richeſſe and auarice, buſying themſelues in terreſtriall affaires, and therfore the ſeed cannot profitt them. But they are like to fertile land, who heare the word of God, and with the hart obſerue and practiſe it, and doe worckes worthy of penance. Lett vs therfore, as our Lord ſaith, ſuffer the dead to bury the dead. Lett vs be ſeriously wary of the slightes and miſcheiuous deuiſes
                                       Matt. 8. of the deuill, who ſeeketh no other thing but to ſeparate our ſoule from vnion with God by the bait of temporall richeſſe, honours, and pleaſures of the fleſh, ſeeking to become lord and maſter of the hart of man, employing all his endeauour to root out of his memory the preceptes of God, and doth ſtriue to blind the hart of man in the deſires and cogitations of the world and to confirme him in them, according to the ſaying of our lord: When the vncleane ſpiritt ſhall depart out of a
                                       Luc. 11. man, he wandereth through places without water ſeeking reſt. And not finding, he ſaith, I will retourne into my houſe whence I departed. And when he is come, he findeth it ſwept with a beſome, and trimmed.

Thē he goeth &amp; taketh ſeuen other ſpirits worſe then himſelfe, &amp; entring in theydwel there. And the things laſt of that mā be made worſe then the firſt. Sith then we are by theſe ſpeeches admonished, lett vs not procure our ruine and death by diſvniting our ſoule from God, for whatſoeuer terreſtriall recompenſe, affaire, or fauour, but lett all we doe, be only for the loue of God. I pray all the Brethren, that being freed and deliuered of al impediment and hinderance, that may trouble them, they make their beſt endeauour, to ſerue, loue, and honour God, with a pure hart, and free ſpiritt, in regard that he eſpecially requireth the ſame of vs: and lett vs ſo proceede, that in vs may be the reſidence of his diuine Maieſtie, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, who
                                       Luc. 21. faith vnto vs: Pray att all times that you may be accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that are to come, and to ſtand before the Sonne of man: he alſo teaching vs to pray, ſaith: When you shall pray, ſay: Our
                                       Matt. 6. Ioan. 4. Father which art in heauen: We therfore muſt alwayes pray and neuer faile therin. Lett vs adore God with a ſincere hart, becauſe ſuch adorers pleaſe the eternall Father and he would haue it ſo. God is a ſpiritt, and they that adore him, ought to adore him in ſpiritt, &amp; truth. Let vs haue recourſe to our Lord, as to the Father and Paſtour of our ſoules, who ſaith: I am the good Paſtour, that feed and keep my flocke, euen to the
                                       Ioan 10. Matt. 23. expoſing of my life for it: you are all Brethren, therfore call not your ſelues Fathers on earth, becauſe you haue but one Father which is in heauen, nor call your ſelues maſters, for you haue but one celeſtiall Maſter.

And where there are two or three aſſembled in my name, I am there with them euen to the end of the world. The wordes that I haue ſpoken to you, be ſpiritt and life. I am the way, and the verity, and the life: lett vs then keep the true life and doctrine, and the holy goſpell which it hath pleaſed him to manifeſt vnto vs, as he ſayth: Father I haue manifeſted thy name to the men whome thou gaueſt me, and they haue receiued the doctrine which I haue giuen them: they haue knowne that I am truely come from thee, and they haue beleeued that thou haſt ſent me. For them I praye, not for the world, but for them whome thou haſt giuen me. Holy Father, keepe them in thy name, whome thou haſt giuen me that they may be one, as alſo we. Theſe things I ſpeake in the world, that they may haue my ioy filled in themſelues. I haue giuen them thy word, and the world hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the world: as I alſo am not of the world. I pray not that thou take them away out of the world, but that thou preſerue them from euill. Sanctifie them in truth. Thy word is truth. As thou diddeſt ſend me into the world, I alſo haue ſent them into the world. And for them I doe ſanctifie my ſelfe:

that they alſo may be ſanctified in truth. And not for them onlie doe I pray, but for them alſo that by their word ſhall beleeue in me: that they all may be one, that the world may beleeue that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loued them, as me alſo thou haſt loued: and thou ſhalt lett them know thy name, becauſe the loue whereby thou haſt loued me ſhall be in them, and in me together. By the ſame meane Father, whome thou haſt giuen me, I will, that where I am, they alſo may be with me: that they may ſee my glorie which thou haſt giuen me. I praye all the Brethren in the name of almightie God, to learne the ſence of that which is written in this life for the ſaluation of our ſoules, and to imprint it with great caution in their vnderſtanding, and I beſeech God Three and One, to vouchſafe to impart his benediction to all them that teach and learne, and that accord together to accompliſh the thinges afore ſaid: and as often as they ſhall read ouer the ſame for the good of their ſoule. I further beſeech all the Brethren (kiſsing their feet) to loue them exceedinglie, and to obſerue them. And in the behalfe of God and the Pope, I Brother Francis, by obedience haue commanded, and doe oblige, that no man diminiſh or augment any thing of that which is written in this life and rule, and that neither the Brethren haue any other rule.

                  THE XXIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Francis, determined to repaire with his companions and diſciples vnto the Pope, to demaund confirmation of the aforeſaid rule, compoſed and compiled more by the holie Ghoſt then by himſelfe, according to the wordes and ſence of the holy Goſpell. And did in deed with them attempt the iorny, repleniſhed with exceeding confidence and conducted by God himſelfe, who ſeeing their deſire vouchſafed to add more courage to that weak harted familie, who out of their ſimplicity feared, perhappes, they ſhouldA dreame of S. Francis. not be heard. And out of his aboundant clemency he permitted his ſeruant Francis, in a dreame, to ſee a tree of merueillous greatenes, comming to the foot wherof, he was by diuine vertue lifted from the earth, and raiſed euen to the toppe therof, which ſeemed to bend downe his braunches euen to the ground. Hauing interpreted this viſion to be a manifeſt preſage of the fauour which he ſhould receiue of the Pope, entierly filled with a ſpirituall ioy, he recounted it to his companions,

whome he ſo comforted, that with exceeding ſpeed they arriued att Roome: where vnderſtanding that Pope Innocent the third was att S. Iohns of Lateran, they all repayred thither. But they found him ſo employed in cogitations of trouble ſome affaires, that not hauing opportunity to heare them, he diſmiſſed them his preſence. Theſe poore people then much diſquieted, retired to the hoſpitall of S. Antony, where they were graciously entertained. But the Pope the nightA dreame of the Pope. following had in a dreame this reuelation. He ſaw betweene his feet to grow a litle palme, which by litle and litle ſo grew, that it became a very faire tree. His holines muſing on this that exceedingly amazed him, ſought the interpretatiō therof, but the holy Ghoſt in the end illuminated him, who gaue him to vnderſtand, that the palme ſignified the poore family of Francis, to whome he vouchſafed not to giue audience. He therfore in the morning cauſed S. Francis to be ſought, who was found in the ſaid hoſpitall, whence he was conducted to the Pope: att whoſe feet this bleſſed Father with all his company fell on his knees, and then humbly diſcouered what he deſired of his holines. The PopeAn other dreame and viſiō of the Pope. ſeeing him, and conſidering him with more attention, called to minde what he ſeemed certaine dayes before to ſee as he was one night ſolitarily penſiue and heauy with sleepe, by meanes of waighty affaires which then did buſſy him, which was, that the ſaid Church of S. Iohn was ready to fall, and that there came afterward a poore man, miſpriſed of the world, who ſo ſuſtayned the ſame that it fell not. The Pope then Beholding S. Francis, conſidering the purity and ſimplicitie of his ſoule, and in what ſort he contemned the world, how much he affected pouerty, the conſtancy of his firme reſolution touching the euangelicall life, which he carryed written about him, and wherin he promiſed obedience to the Sea Apoſtolike, the zeale which he perceiued in him towardes the ſaluatiō of ſoules, the feruour &amp; freedome of ſpiritt for the ſeruice of IESVS CHRIST, he ſaid in himſelfe: This doubtles is the man whome I ſaw, who with his worckes of example &amp; doctrine ſhall helpe to ſupport and ſuſtaine the Church of God. Notwithſtāding he differred to graunt his demaūd, by reaſon that it ſeemed to many Cardinals a matter rare, and exceeding humane forces &amp; abilities, to keep &amp; obſerue a profeſsion of ſuch rigour and pouerty. But whiles they were in the Conſiſtory thus irreſolute, the Cardinall Paul, biſhop of Sabee named Iohn, a louer of the poore of IESVS CHRIST, inſpired of God, publikely vttered theſe ſpeeches: If we graunt not the demaund preſented vnto vs by this great ſeruant of God, as ſeeming vnto vs a thing ſtrange and ouer difficult, though in deed he requireth only the forme and rule of the euangelicall life to be confirmed vnto him, we may iuſtly feare to offend our Lord

IESVS CHRIST, and the goſpell: for you know if any one ſhould affirme that ſome new or rare thing, vnreaſonable, or impoſsible to be performed were contained in the obſeruation of the euangelicall perfection and in the vow therof, we ſhould eſteeme him a blaſpheamour againſt IESVS CHRIST the author of the goſpell. The Pope hauing well vnderſtood this propoſition, he tourned to S. Francis, and ſaid vnto him: My ſonne, pray vnto God that by thy interceſsion he diſcouer vnto vs his holy will, which being knowne vnto vs, we will freely and without any ſcruple approue thy demaund. S. Francis vpon this commandement departed, and with his accuſtomed feruour fell to his prayers, beſeeching our Lord that he would be pleaſed to inſpire the Pope to doe what ſhould be moſt for the glory of his diuine maieſtie, and to inſtruct him what ſpeech he ſhould vſe to obtaine that which he ſo piously required. In this prayer it was miraculously reuealed vnto him what he ſhould ſay, and was aſſured thatThe parabole which S. F. vſed to the Pope to perſuade him to confirme his rule. the Pope ſhould condiſcendingly heare him. Being then ioyfully retourned to the Pope, he ſayd, that God had reuealed vnto him this ſimilitud. That a poore woman of right beautifull conntenance, and rare conditions, dwelling in the woodes, chaunced one day to be ſeene by her kinge, who admiring her ſo ſinguler beauty, reſolued to eſpouſe hir with hope to haue by her a faire and comely generation. And hauing in that ſort accepted her, ſhe in ſhort time brought him many children in that deſert, to whome being well growne, the mother ſaid: Know my children that the king is your Father, goe yee therfore to the Court, and feare not to conuerſe with the greateſt, and he will exalt you to a degree anſweareable to your diſcent. Theſe children leauing their mother, repaired to the Court, where being arriued and ſeene of the king, they weere by him with exceeding admiration att their beautie incontinently acknowledged to be his children: yet not withſtanding he demaunded them whoſe children they were: they anſweared, their mother was a poore woman, that liued in the vnco the deſert. But the king, who knew them before, and made them this demaund, only to proue the conſtancie of his children, being moued att lenght with a fatherlie affection, embraced them very amourously, and ſaid: Feare not: for if till this day I haue and doe maintaine ſtrangers, how much more reaſon haue I to maintaine you, you, I ſay, that are my moſt deere children? And this affection will I ſhew to all thoſe that henceforward ſhalbe borne of your mother my deerly affected wife. Applying which parabole, he ſaid: Holy Father, our rule and life is this poore woman, by the mercy of the king of kinges accepted for his eſpouſe, of whome he hath begotten many children, whome his diuine maieſty neither hath nor euer will faile to ſuſtaine:

and as he hath a care to releeue ſtrangers, your holines need not doubt but he will alſo haue regard to maintaine and ſupport his true and ligitimate children, that the heires of the eternall king periſh not by hunger, who are borne according to his likenes, by vertue of the holy Ghoſt, of a poore mother, to witt, of the euangelicall pouerty, and nourced with his proper milk. And if the king of heauen promiſe the eternall kingdome to thoſe that follow him with faith and verity, how much rather will he giue them ſuch thinges as he ordinarily with ſo bountifull liberality beſtoueth indifferently on the good and the wicked? The Pope hauing with carefull attention heard this ſimilitude, and ſo patheticall and ſtrong argument of the S. he admired and ſincerely acknowledged that our Lord IESVS CHRIST dwelled in S. Francis. Without farther delay therfore, and without admitting any otherA probation of the Pope for the rule and life of the Frier Minors. difficulty, he approued his rule, permitted him, with the title of precher of pennance, to preach ouer all the world, and cauſed litle crounes to be made to all the lay Brethren that were with him. And thervpon S. Francis with all his companions made his ſolemne profeſsion vnder the handes of the Pope, promiſing to obſerue the euangelicall life and rule: and he was by his holines eſtabliſhed Miniſter generall of all his Order, who offered and promiſed him his aſsiſtance when ſoeuer he ſhould need it. But becauſe this confirmation of the rule was then only made Viuae vocis oraculo, by the Popes worde of mouth,S. F. was made Minister generall of the Order by the Pope. the yeare of grace 1209. and the thirteenth of the Popedome of the ſaid Pope Innocent the third, nor hauing no Bulle of this confirmation, therfore the beginning of the Order is not reckoned from that time, but from the time that it was afterward confirmed by writing, which was in the eight yeare of Pope Honorious with an authenticall Bulle, fifteene veares after this firſt verball confirmation, as in place and order ſhall hereafter be inſerted.
               
               
                  How S. Francis retourned to Aſsiſium, and how God declared vnto him, that his Order was inſtituted for the ſaluation. of the ſoules of the faithfull.
                  THE XXIV. CHAPTER.
                  
                     S. F. and his Religious miraculouſly prouided for. SAinct Francis exceedingly encouraged by obtaining the ſo much deſired confirmation, departed from Rome towardes the vally of Spoletum there to beginne to preach the goſpell of IESVS CHRIST, diſcourſing alwayes with his companions by the way, in what ſort they might moſt perfectlie obſerue the profeſsion formerlie made. In which diſcourſe hauing ſpent a good part of their way,

and being wearied, they reſted themſelues in a ſolitary place, no leſſe afflicted with hunger then with trauaile, not hauing with them any prouiſion, nor humanely cauſe to hope after any meanes of releife. But our moſt mercifull God, who is euer true, and neuer faileth his faithfull, of himſelfe prouided for them, cauſing in a moment a man to appeare loaden with bread, who as ſoone as he had diſtributed it to thoſe poore of IESVS CHRIST, diſappeared andWhy they confirmed and iterated the ſtrict vow of pouerlie. was neuer by any of them ſeene againe. Theſe poore Religious therfore, acknowledging this grace and fauour to be afforded them by the handes of God, were exceedingly comforted, and there purpoſed and irreuocablie confirmed, neuer to breake that ſtrict and rigorous vow of pouerty for any want of food, or whatſoeuer other neceſsity or affliction that might befall them: and with this feruour and good reſolution, they trauailed through the vally of Spoletum, diſcourſing with themſelues whither it were better for them to dwell in ſolitary places for their particuler repoſe, or to conuerſe in the world, for edification of their neighbour. Vpon which point S. Francis hauing long time conferred with his diſciples (not minding of himſelfe to determine in ſuch a caſe, wherin he would not relie on his owne reſolution) he made his prayer vnto God, that touching this point, he would manifeſt vnto him his holy will, which he knew by this meane. He vnderſtood thatGod manifeſteth to S. Fra. that he would be ſerued of his Order in the actiue life: he was ſent of God, to endeauour to gaine many ſoules vnto him, as Satan ſought to robbe him of them, to carrie them together with himſelfe into hell. He therfore reſolued rather with his companions to conuerſe in the world for the profitt of manie, then to liue in an hermitage to benifitt only himſelfe. Hauing then ſetled himſelfe with his Brethren in a deſolate houſe neere to Aſsiſium, they there liued conformably to their rule in very ſimple pouertie, ſeeming rather to ſuſtaine themſelues with the bread of teares, then with temporall conſolations. They ordinarily employed themſelues in prayer, and eſpecially mentall, becauſe they were not as then fourniſhed with bookes, nor brouiaryes, to ſay their cannonicall houres, andHow S. F. taught his brethren to pray. ſo in ſupplie therof, they made their exerciſe in the excellent booke of the life of IESVS CHRIST, meditating therō day &amp; night according to the inſtructiō that their bleſſed Father gaue thē: for he cōtinuallie preached vnto thē the croſſe of our Lord IESVS CHRIST. And wheras the Brethrē moſt inſtantlie beſought S. F. to teach thē ſome forme of prayer, he vſed vnto thē the wordes of our Lord: When you praye, ſay: Pater noster qui es in caelis, &amp;c. and afterward, Adoramus te Chriſte, &amp;c. We adore thee our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and we praiſe and honour thee here, &amp; in all the churches of the world, becauſe by thy croſſe thou haſt redeemed

the world. He alſo taught them to praiſe and honour God, in all creatures, to reuerence preiſtes, to beleeue ſimply, and to confeſſe firmely the truth of the Faith, as the holie Catholique and Romane Church beleeueth and confeſſeth: and his diſciples with admiration of his doctrine were attentiue vnto him. They fell on their knees when they ſaw any Church a far of, and there they made theyr prayer, as the S. had inſtructed them.
               
               
                  Of the admirable viſion of a fiery chariott, wheron the glorious S. Francis appeared vnto his diſciples.
                  THE XXV. CHAPTER.
                  THe poore colledge of S. Francis was neere to a place called Riuotorto, in an old houſe, and ſo litle that they could hardly accōmodate themſelues ſitting one cloſe by an other. From thence went foorth the louer of pouerty to preach pennance and contempt of the world, firſt by worckes and then by wordes. But being one ſaterday in the euening gone thence, he went with a Brother to Aſsiſium, there to preach the ſunday as he was accuſtomed to doe. And to this effect, he retired into a poore houſe adioyning to the biſhopprick. Being about midnight in prayer, a fiery chariott of admirable ſplendour ſodēly appeared to his poore family, which entring att the doore of their cottage, where ſome prayed, and others slept, it there turned three times: In the middes of this chariott was the glorious Father S. Francis, and ouer him a circled cloud and bright as the ſunne, the ſplendour whereof gaue light to the obſcurity of the night; and then thoſe that slept by meanes of the noyſe did awake, &amp; the bodyes of the Bretheren were ſo illuminated and reſplendant, that their conſciences were diſcouered each to other: and att lenght they mutually ſeeing each others hart, perceiued that S. Francis though abſent in body, was preſent in ſpiritt: and that by a ſupernaturall vertue he appeared vnto them on that fiery chariott, to inſinuate vnto them that they ought to follow him as true Iſraelites, ſith as an other Elias, he was by the prouidence of God4. Reg. 2. deputed to be their chariott and guide. It is credible that our Lord att the prayer of S. Francis, opened the eyes of theſe ſimple ſeruantes, that they might ſee the maieſtie of God, as he did, when he opened the eyes of the ſeruant of Elizeus, to lett him ſee the mountaine full of armed men, of fiery chariottes, and of Angels that were there to protect4. Reg. 6. the Prophett. So that the S. incontinently retourning, began to penetrate their hartes and to comfort them with this ſtrange viſion, diſcouering vnto them diuers extraordinarie and admirable

thinge of the augmentation of their order and explicating vnto them many thinges that euen exceed humane vnderſtanding. Which gaue the Brethren to vnderſtand, that the holy Ghoſt was really diſcended and with ſuch perfection remayned alwayes in him, that he was vnto them, &amp; to all the faithfull the ſecureſt way they could poſsibly haue, wherby to procure their ſaluation.
               
               
                  How S. Francis went to dwell at our Lady of Angels.
                  THE XXVI. CHAPTER.
                  THis holy Paſtour of a flocke litle in nomber, yet great in merittes, determined to leaue the ſaid place, as well by reaſon that it was not capable conueniently to lodge them, as alſo becauſe they were there exceedingly diſquieted, he therfore ſaid to his childrē: My deerly beloued, I know that God will multiplie vs, it therfore ſeemeth neceſſarie that we repaire to to the Biſhop of Aſsiſium, or to the Canons of S. Ruffinus, or to the Abbott of S. Benedict, to begg of them ſome poore Church, where we may read the canonicall houres, &amp; neere vnto it, ſome poore cottage built of loame and laughtes, wherin we may be all couered and haue what ſhalbe neceſſary for vs: by reaſon 
                        The biſhop and canons of Aſsiſium deny a place to S. Fra. to ledge him and his.
                        An Abbott of the Order of S. Benedict doth accommodate thē. Why the monaſtery of S.
                      that this place, as you ſee, is not capable to entertaine many Brethren, beſides the inconuenience, which to vs is more intollerable, that the ſtrictnes therof doth not afford vs meanes to read our canonicall houres, nor leſſe to burie on of our company, if any chaunce to dye here. The Brethren approued theſe conſiderations. Repairing then to the Biſhop, humbly to demaund his neceſsitie, he receiued anſwere, that he had neither church, nor houſe for him. The Canons anſweared as much: taking leaue therfore of thē, he went vp to the mount Sabuſio, to a monaſterie of S. Benedict and demaunding for the Abbott, he preſented the ſame petition, relating vnto him the anſweare and deniall of the biſhop and Canons. The Abbott hauing attentiuely beheld him, inſpired of God, with a generall conſent of all his Religious, gaue to S. Francis and his diſciples, the Church of S. Mary of Portiuncula, which was among all other the pooreſt they had: but the ſame that S. Francis eſpecially deſired, and to whome and to his the Abbott ſaid: My brethren, vnderſtand this: We graunt all that you haue demaunded vs, but in recompence, we require that, if God giue you grace to multiply, as we hope, the cheife of your religion haue his reſidence in this place. Wherto S. Francis, hauing graciously thancked them for their exhibited fauour, anſweared that the place which they had beſtowed on them, ſhould be as they deſired the principall of his Order. S. Francis

hauing obtayned this requeſt, tooke his leaue, and retourned exceedinglyMary of Angels is cheife of the Order of the Frier Minors. ſatisfied, as well in regard that the ſaid church was dedicated to the moſt holy Virgin, by whoſe merittes he had receiued many graces of God, and hoped yet many greater, as alſo, becauſe it was ſurnamed Porticella, of the place where it was built, which was ancientlie called in latin Portiuncula, that is, a litle portion, the true figure of the religion which he profeſſed to obſerue, which was the ſtricteſt and moſt painfull life that in all the holy church was obſerued, and that of all other was to haue the leaſt part in this world. The holy Father vpon this occaſion ſaid, that God would not that the firſt Brethren of the Order ſhould build an other church, to the end the foreſaid prophefie might be accompliſhed by the Frier Minors, who were to perſiſt in the perfection of Euangelicall pouerty, to encreaſe and multiplie ouer allWhat rēt S. Fra. gaue for the monaſterie. the world. And notwith ſtanding, (as I ſaid before) the ſaid Abbott and his Religious had entierlie giuen him the ſaid church, without reſeruation of any acknoledgement, S. Francis neuertheles, as a louer of pouertie, a good and prudent Founder, that would eſtabliſh his religion on a ſtrict and ſharpe pouertie, did yearlie ſend and giue to the ſaid Abbott, a litle baskett full of ſmall fiſhes, which he tooke in a neighbour riuer, as a note, not onlie of humilitie, but alſo of acknoledgement, that his brethren might vnderſtand that they had nothing in proprietie, ſith they paye euen for the permiſsion of the Church, for which they gaue the ſaid fiſhes, which were in great reuerence and deuotion receiued of the ſaid Abbott and Religious, and in recompence therof was giuen them a veſſell of oyle. The poore of IESVS CHRIST being thus accommodated in the houſe of the glorious Virgin, there began incontinentlie to breath forth the ſweete ſauour of their vertue, and not only in the vally of Spoletum: but euen in diuers partes of the world: by reaſon that S. Francis went from thence to preach in diuers places, not with wordes of terreſtriall, humane, and artificiall ſcience, but by vertue of the holie Ghoſt; and that with ſuch merueilous efficacie, that his audience admired him as celeſtiall, becauſe he moſt ordinarilie fixed his countenance on heauen, ſeeking and endeauouring to eleuate and raiſe the creatures from the earth to their Creatour.

                  THE XXVII. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy ſeruant of God being with his diſciples in his new reſidence, in extreame auſterity of life, moſt zealous exerciſe ofHow much the preaching of S. Fr. did profitt. prayer, and feruour (both by example and doctrine) of the ſaluatiō of ſoules; the worthy vigne of IESVS CHRIST began to ſprout forth new buddes, to branch, and produce odoriferous floures and ſauourous fruictes of vertue, and reſpect towardes his diuine Maieſty. For there being many conuerted and enflamed in the loue of IESVS CHRIST, they bound themſelues with ſtrict and new lawes of pē
                     nance, following the rule and holy counſaile of the bleſſed ſeruant of God. Others, not only touched with deuotion, but inflamed with a holy deſire to imitate him, did tread his holy ſteppes, and concerning the contempt of worldly vanities, and earthly appetites, did choſe him for their guid: and following the ſpiritt, they in ſhort time augmented to ſuch a quantity, that they enuironned the whole world: One of the firſt that then came was the bleſſed Brother Silueſter, the twelueth Diſciple who was the firſt preiſt that entred into the Order: he was of Aſsiſium, and the manner of his conuerſion was thus: He was preſent when Brother Bernard Quintaualle by helpe of the S. diſtributed what the had to the poore. And ſeeing with what liberality he gaue his mony to the poore his auarice therby encreaſed and therfore he ſpake to S. Francis, to pay him the reſidue for the ſtones which he had deliuered him, to the building and reſtabliſhing the foreſaid churches. But the S. admiring this demaund without making any reply, thruſt his hand into the purſe of Quintaualle and gaue him a handfull of mony, and then asked him if he were ſatisfied, or would haue more: wherto he anſweared that he would no more but was contented. And being retourned to his houſe, and finally perceiuing the diueliſh couetouſnes, that had blinded him, he ſharpely reprehended and checked himſelfe, and exceedinglie commended the feruour and liberalitie▪ of Brother Bernard, and the ſanctitie of S. Francis, and as well in regard of this light of conſcience and true knowledge of him ſelfe, as that God had already elected and predeſtinated him to this new life of perfection; he had ſhortly after a ſtrange dreame three ſeuerall nightes together. He ſaw in a dreame the citty of Aſsiſium enuironned with a mighty andA viſion of Brother Silueſter before he was religious. hideous dragon which ſeemed to intend the deſtruction, not only of the ſaid citty, but alſo of all the country neere: He ſaw alſo to proceed

out of the mouth of S. Francis a faire and lardge croſſe of gold, the toppe wherof touched the heauen, and the armes therof ſtretched euen to the two endes of the earth, att the ſight of which croſſe this venimous dragon fled. For that time he ſpake not a word of this dreame, becauſe he did not perfectly beleeue: But conſidering that the Pope had confirmed the rule of S. Francis, whoſe perſeuerance alſo in ſanctity of life and doctrine admiring, he recounted vnto him this viſion: and hauing afterward diſtributed his goodes to the poore, he tooke the habitt of the Order of the ſaid S. with whome he liued ſo piously and with ſuch obſeruance of his rule, that of his part he verified what he had ſeene. There was att that time one of the Order called Cruciferi who are Religious wherof there are many in Italy, the greater part being gentilmen: they are cloathed in violet, and perpetually carry a croſſe of ſiluer in their handes) his name was Mauricius who was greiuously ſick in an hoſpitall neere to Aſsiſium: where being diſpaired of and abandoned by the Phiſitions, he repoſed all his hope and confidence in God, and by meſſage vnto S. Francis, of whome he had a right good opinion, ſeriously beſought him, that he would vouchſafe to pray to God for him. Which the holy Father hauing done, he incontinently tooke crummes of bread, which he ſteeped in the oyle of the lampe, that burned before the image of the virgin Mary, wherof he made a new kind of oyntmēt, which he ſent to the ſicke perſō by two of his Brethrē ſaying vnto them: Carrye this Medicine to our Brother Mauricius, wherby God ſhall not only reſtore him to perfect health, but ſhall diſpoſe him alſo to be his ſeruaunt in our company. It ſo came to paſſe: for hauing taken this medicine, he was inſtantly cured: it was not confected by anyS.

In that manner did he liue for many yeares, neither drinking wine, nor eating bread nor any thing dreſſed by fire: but contented himſelfe with the only nourriſhment of hearbes, pulſe, fruites, which extreme abſtinence neuer diſtempered his body, but was for diuers yeares preſerued in health and ſtrength ſufficient to ſupport the labours and weariſomnes of the Order: for which, after his death, God, by his merittes wrought many miracles.

                  IN ſhort time after entred into the Order this ſaid Brother Leo, who was confeſſour to S. Francis. Among manie

                     vertues wherwith this Brother was endued, there appeared eſpecially one, which the ſaid S. exceedinglie priſed, to witt, an Angelicall ſimplicitie, in fauour wherof he was verie familier to S. Francis, and did participate of all his ſecretcs, and therfore the ſaid S. did often call him, Brother Beaſt of God. Brother Maceus of Marignan, did alſo enter into the ſaid Order, he was a famous Courtyer, and for his prudence exceedinglie honoured of the world: he obtained of God, grace to edifie much by his pious diſcourſes: and therfore did S. Francis often take him for his companion: and when any came to viſitt him, they were ſo entertained with the worthey diſcourſes of Br. Maceus, that S. Francis was not interrupted of his prayer. Brother William an Engliſhman made himſelfe alſo of the Order, who was of ſo pious a life, that he meritedThe firſt infringer of the rule of the Frier Minors, as an other Iudas att lenght did hang himſelfe. to be one of the firſt twelue diſciples of the S. in place of Brother Iohn Capella who was one of that nomber: but being the firſt that participating in the habitt, tranſgreſſed the rules, he was chaſticed of God by the ſoares of leaprie, which correction not receiuing att the hande

                      of the infinite bountie in ſuch ſort as he ought, being moued with rage he grew into ſuch furie of impatience, and the deuill ſo blinded him, that running out of the Religion, he as an other Iudas hung himſelfe. Now this child of perditiō being raſed out of the nōber, the ſaid Brother William was ſubrogated in his place, who was a man of ſuch perfection, that whē he died, God ſhewed by manie notable miracles, how pleaſing and gratefull the merittes of ſo worthie a ſeruant of his was vnto him. Brother Ruffinus was a verie rich gentleman of Aſsiſium, neere of kinred vnto S. Clare: who being exceedinglie edified by the conuerſion, life and doctrine of S. Francis, was alſo conuerted, and att this time tooke the habitt. He perſeuered a virgin and pure in religion, as he entred into it, which proceeded of the fauour and grace of God. He was verie deep in contemplation. Brother Pacificus did afterward enter into the Order in this manner: Being a very famous Poett, he was interiourlie affected by the Emperour Frederick the ſecond, who with his owne hand crouned him with laurell, and entitled him the Prince of Poetry. ButHow Brother as the merittes of the vertues of the holie Father S. Francis did augmēt, and the moſt pleaſing ſauour of his ſanctitie was ſpread in diuers places, diuers being moued and induced with ſo ſinguler a vertue, went

from the Court of the ſaid Emperour, where he was with a generallPacifious miraculously entred the Order of the Frier Minors. admiration ſo much prayſed for a great miſpriſer of the world, expresly to ſee him: Among others Brother Pacificus, then a famous poett and Courtier, conceiued a deſire to ſee and heare him: and therfore he attempted a iourny to find him, which he did, when he leaſt thought therof, at the towne of S. Seuerin within the limites of Ancona, where he ſaw the ſaid S. miraculously croſſed with two glittering ſwordes, wherof thone reached from his head euen to the middes of his feet: and the other a croſſe from the left hand to the right; by which viſion, though he had neuer ſeene S. Francis, he notwithſtanding inſtantly knew him, and was then by God conuerted to the chaunge of his profeſsion, to abandon the world, and to vnite himſelfe with him, as well in that he had bin touched by the wordes of S. Francis, as tranſpearced with the ſword of the holy Ghoſt that iſſued out of his mouth. Hauing then miſpriſed and renounced the vanities of the world, he incontinētly adhered to the ſaid S. with a firme purpoſe to follow him. Which the holy Father preceiuing, who by the ſpiritt of God vnderſtood that his conuerſion was perfect and entierly chaunged from the inquietudes of world, to the peace and tranquility of IESVS CHRIST, he gaue him the name of Brother Pacificus. This man perſeuering in the ſeruice of God, merited att an other time to ſee the holy Father S. Francis with the great Thau (which is a Greek letter made in forme of a croſſe) painted on his forehead with ſuch liuely colours, that they caſt as it were a diuine light vpon the face of the ſaid S. Att the very ſame time Brother Geniprus entred into the ſaid religion: he was a man endued with profound humility and patience, as in his life appeareth.

                  THE XXIX. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Iohn a man of deep ſimplicity, was about that time admitted after this manner. It happened that S. Francis goeing to preach in a church, and finding it foule and very vncleane, he ſwept it himſelfe. The report then incontinently ran through thoſe quarters, that S. Francis was arriued in that village, whervpon out of a great deuotion that the people bare him, many reprayed thither, and among others the ſaid Brother Iohn, att that time a very ſimple man, who being at his labour when he vnderſtood of the comming of the S. leaſt his oxen, feild and plough to goe to ſee him, and was one of the firſt that came vnto him, whome he found ſweeping the ſaid church,

and therfore ſaid vnto him: Brother giue me this broome, I will aſſiſt you, and taking it out of his handes, he ended the ſweeping of the church. S. Francis ſoone after perceiuing the affluence of people there preſent, becauſe he preached to each ones great contentment, he retired himſelfe, and the ſaid Iohn inſinuating himſelfe vnto him, ſaid: I haue for many dayes had a deſire to ſerue God, and ſince I haue heard ſpoaken of you, this my deſire hath exceedingly encreaſed, but I knew not where to find you. Now ſith it pleaſed God that I haue this day mett you, I am reſolued to accompany you and to follow your commandements. The holy Father perceiuing his quality and good purpoſe, and exceedinglie reioycing in God to vnderſtand that by reaſon of his great ſimplicitie he ſhould proue a good Brother, he thus anſweared: My Brother if you deſire to obſerue our rule, and to conyoine your ſelfe with vs, it is precedentlie neceſſarie that you depriue your ſelfe of what ſoeuer you haue in the world, and following that which the goſpell doth counſaile vs, that you diſtribute it vnto the poore: for all thoſe of mine that could, haue done the ſame. Which this good and ſimple Iohn hauing heard, he retourned to the place whence he came from his labour, and looſing an oxe from the plough, he brought it to the S. and ſaid: I haue for ſo many yeares ſerued my father and his houſe, therfore though this be a very ſclender recompence, I will neuertheles, for the portion of mine inheritance, content my ſelfe with this oxe, which, as mine I will giue to the poore, or will diſpoſe of him as to you ſhall be moſt pleaſing. But as the holie Father and he conſulted together what ſhould be done with this oxe, his kinred hauing notice that his reſolution was to leaue them, came all where he was, and did there ſo bitterlie lament, that the S. conceiued great compaſsion therat: and for their conſolation he ſaid: Prepare ſome thing ſpeedilie to eat and weep not, for I will recomfort you. So they went together to one of their houſes, where they did eat with the S. who after dinner, addreſsing himſelfe to the Father of the ſaid Iohn, ſaid vnto him: you ought not thus to diſquiett your ſelfe for that your ſonne hath a deſire to ſerue God, but rather ought you to reioyce theratt and to giue thanckes to IESVS CHRIST, who is content to be ſerued by one of your bloud: by meane of this yourſonne Iohn, you this day gaine all our Religious to be your children and Brethren. And he being the creature of God (whome to ſerue is to raigne hath) now made choice to ſerue his Creatour. But that, in this his ſeruice of God, you remaine not vtterly diſcomforted, I will that in regard of your pouerty he leaue you this oxe, wheras according to the goſpell he ought to giue it to other poore people. His parentes did then ſhew themſelues

much comforted, eſpecially in regard of the oxe he left them, for they lamented him as much in reſpect of their pouerty, as their ſonne did of charity. By this meane S. Francis gayned his Brother Iohn, as Elias did Elizaeus, retiring him from temporall labour to the perfect labour3. Reg. 19. of the vigne of God. And becauſe the S. exceedinglie affected pouerty in himſelfe and in others, being once cloathed, he euer after tooke him with him for his companion: which ſo augmented in him this his ſimplicity of hart, that whatſoeuer he ſaw the S. to doe, the ſame he ſought to imitate. For if he ſaw him in prayer, he would ſeeke ſome place where he might eaſily obſerue him, to conforme himſelfe vnto him euen in his very geſtures, ſo that if S. Francis were on his knees; or ſtanding vp right in prayer, or proſtrate with his face vpon the earth, or if he held his handes ioyned together on high, if he ſighed, if heMerueilous ſimplicite of Br. Iohn. ſpett, or coughed, Brother Iohn would doe the like. S. Francis once reprehending him for it, he thus anſweared: I haue promiſed to God to doe what ſoeuer I ſhall ſee you doe, and therfore I muſt endeauour to conforme me entierly vnto you. The holy Father admired and together reioyced to finde him ſo conſtant in his ſimplicity, by meane wherof he ſo much att lenght profited in all other kind of vertues, that all the other Brethren held the perfection wherto he arriued in great admiration. But by reaſon that the world was not worthie of ſo pure a conſcience, God afterwardes called him to himſelfe. After his death S. Francis with great ioy recounted vnto his Brethren his holy conuerſation,Br. Iohn. after his death called ſaint. and called him not Brother Iohn, but S. Iohn. It happened about that time, that S. Francis preaching in the prouince of Ancona, there came one day after ſermon a man vnto him, that ſaid, he would leaue the world and dwell with him; to whome S. Francis anſweared: If thou deſire to enter into this order, goe firſt and accōpliſh the ſaying
                        Matth. 19. of the goſpell: Sell what thou haſt, and giue it to the poore. He then incōtinently went and diſtributed all his goodes amōg his kinred, being herevnto moued rather by paſsiō of the fleſh, then deuotion of the ſpiritt: and then retourned to S. Frācis, to whome he ſaid: Father I haue forſakē all that I had. The holie Father demāded of him in what manner he had diſpoſed therof: and he replyed that he had diſtributed it amōg his poore and needy kinred. S. Frācis then knowing that this man had notSeculer almoſe. any feruour of ſpiritt, ſaid vnto him: Brother Fly, ſith thou haſt giuē they goodes to they kinred, gett thee home, and aſke no more to liue of almoſe with my poore Brethrē. So this wretch retourned alone to his kinred, as vnworthy to liue with ſo manie perfect ſeruātes of God. Many others inſpired by the ſupreme boūty and with an exceeding feruour of ſpirit daily entred into the Order: the renowme wherof was ſpread ouer all Italy, yea through all Chriſtēdome. By reaſō that S. Francis ſent his

Thus liued they euery where without feare, and in great tranquility of ſpiritt, without care either by day or night, as they had bin inſtructed by him that is the only, true, and ſinguler Maſter. They kept not the remaynes of one dayes meat for the next, being of beleefe that to endure want of theſe temporall and tranſitory benefittes, was their great richeſſe and aboundance.

                  THE XXX. CHAPTER.
                  SAint Francis knowing that his religion was inſtituted of the holy Ghoſt in the church of God for a mirrour or looking glaſſe, wherin ſinners might behold and contemplate their deformitie, and how far different and diſtant they are from the liknes of God: he for this reſpect endeauoured to annoynt his Brethren with the vnction of IESVS CHRIST, by whoſe vertue he begatt them. So then being repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt, his Order did not only encreaſe in nomber, but in vertue alſo and edification of the faithfull: and to the end that beſides their deuotion they might alſo be exerciſed in charitie▪ and loue of their neighbour, ſith they were piously to cōuerſe in the world, he would often louinglie ſitt downe with them, and in the name of God command, now one, then an other, to make ſome exhortation of that which the holy Ghoſt ſhould dictate vnto him; and this he practiſed often. And one time of all other, they, whome he had enioyned to ſpeake, did all deliuer ſuch excellent and admirable thinges of the bounty and goodnes of God and of his ſecrettes, and this vnpremeditated only by the vertue of obedience, that themſelues grew into admiration therof. He then by experience knew that which God ſaid to hisMatth. diſciples: It is not you that ſpeake before Preſidents and Princes, but the ſpiritt of your Father that ſpeaketh in you. Now whiles theſe holy, pure, and ſimple veſſels, did poure out the baulme of diuine grace, diſcourſing of very high matters of God, and diſcouering the deepe miſteriesOur lord Ieſus Chriſt appeared to. ſaint Francis and his. of the ſcripture, by vertue of obedience vnto their holy Father, our lord IESVS CHRIST appeared vnto them, and ſtood in the middes of them in forme of a moſt beautifull yong man, and gaue them his benediction with ſuch a ſweet and immenſiue grace, that S. Francis and

his Brethren were rauiſhed in extaſie, and fell all in a ſound and as dead to the ground. Being retourned to themſelues S. Francis ſaid: My deerly beloued Brethren, we are much obliged to be thankfull vnto God, for that it hath pleaſed his diuine Maieſty, to manifeſt his treaſure by the mouth of the ſimple, and to appeare vnto vs to lett vs know that he was preſent, and that when it pleaſeth him, he maketh the mouthes of infantes, of the ſimple and mute, to appeare right eloquent. Theſe ſeruantes of God thus repleniſhed with ſo great a light of diuine grace, S. Francis ſent them to illuminate the world, and att their retourne they all repayred to our ladie of Angels, as their true mother, and there they enioyed againe each others ſight with an extreame contentment, which ſo filled them with a ſpirituall exultation, that they eaſilie forgott the labours and contradictions which in their trauiles they had endured. The other Brethren that ſtirred not from the Couent, though ſometimes they were employed in manuall labours about the neceſsities of their houſe, neuertheles, the chiefeſt partGreatferuour of the firſt Freer Minors. of their exerciſe was in prayer, for they very frequentlie prayed with feruour and teares. They aroſe att midnight watching to pray to God for themſelues and for all other ſinners. They had a very tender and mutuall loue to each other. The holy Father ſerued them as a mother doth her only ſonne: charitie ſo burned in them all, that it ſeemed very eaſy vnto them to ſpend their life, not onlie for the loue of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, but euen for the ſafty of one of their Brethren.
                  Two Brothers walking one day through the feildes, they mett a foole, that caſt ſtones att one of them: which the other perceiuing, he ſtept before his companion to receiue the ſtrokes of the ſtones. Theſe good Brethren did ſuch and the like thinges, being induced therto out of perfect charity. They reuerenced one an other, as maſters, and he that by his office, or age, was amongeſt them the principall, would appeare the moſt humble and abiect: they exerciſed themſelues in obedience, each of them being prepared to performe, not only the precept, but euen the will, of his Superiour. They vndoubtedly beleeued that whatſoeuer was commanded them was the will of God, and by that meanes obedience was eaſy and pleaſing vnto them: that they might not be iudged by others, they accuſed and condemned themſelues: and if any ſo much forgatt himſelfe as to vtter a ſcandalous word to one of his Brethren, he would conceaue ſuch remorce and greife theratt, that he was not well, nor could repoſe, till he fell att his feet whome he had offended: to whome, with demaund of pardon,Notable chaſticements for inconſiderate words. he acknowledged his fault, and herewith not content, he would pray the Brother offended to ſett his foot on his mouth, and tread

hard vpon it: In this manner chaſtiſsing themſelues, did they ſuppreſſe and trample pride vnder foot. This was not practiſed only among the ſimple Brethren, but among the Superiours themſelues: For in whatſoeuer place one found himſelfe to haue with out reaſon offended any Brother, he commanded the offended to ſett his foot on his throat, that by this meane the malice and tyrannie of the deuill being ſuppreſſed, loue and fraternall charity might be conſerued among them. They alſo
                        Act. 2. &amp; 4. armed themſelues againſt vices, and exerciſed vertues: beſide this, they vſed their habites, bookes, and other moueables in common, that none among them might preſume to call any thing mine. And albeit they were in deepe degree of pouerty, they were neuertheles in their hartes exceeding rich and moſt liberall, and very freely and ioyfully gaue what was demaunded of them, for the loue of God, fulfilling
                        Matt. 10. his word, who ſaith. Giue that Gratis which you haue receiued for nothing. If any poore people begged the almoſe which had bin giuen them, they gaue it them. He that had not what to giue to the poore that aſked him an almoſe, would giue them part of the habitt that couered him. When the rich of this world came to viſitt them, to conferre with them of ſome ſpirituall matter, they ioyfully entertayned them, and delighted ſometime to frequent their company, ſo to finde occaſion to perſuade them to leaue their ſinnes, and to induce and moue them to doe doe pennance, When their holy Father was to ſend them into the world, they would inſtantly, and as a ſinguler father, craue of him not to ſend them into their owne country, therby to auoyd the conuerſation of their kinred and freindes of this world: becauſe this ſeemed vnto them a certaine kinde of retourne to the world. For what ſoeuer neceſsity that might befall them in their trauaile, they took neither gold, ſiluer, nor otherkind of mony, becauſe they ſingulerly contemned it, and aboue all thinges, did from their hartes tread it vnder foot.
                  Being ſo freed and exempted of all wordly deſires, they numbred themſelues with thoſe of whome Iſai ſaid: how beautifull and ſwift are
                        Iſai. 52. Rom. 10. the feete of the Euangeliſtes, and preachers of peace, and eternall Saluation? Thus did theſe true Religious, circuit the world, by the ſtreight and ſharpe way of their pouerty, ſurmounting the hard ſtones of ſelfe deſires and euill inclinations, breaking the thicke cloudes of the ſinnes and depraued cuſtomes of worldly men, with great paine of their life, walking on the thornes of tribulations and contrarietyes, with exāples,S. Fr. ſolicitous of the leapers. vertues, and doctrine, of pennance: becauſe ſuch is the path way that leadeth them to liue who with a perfect reſolution ſeek the ſame. The holy Father did alſo exerciſe his children in hauing care of leapers, ſo to plant in their ſoule a firme root of humility and mortification of

themſelues: and therfore ordayned his Brethren to be att the hoſpitall of leapers when occaſion required, to ſerue and miniſter vnto them. If any Gentilman preſented himſelfe to be receiued into the order, among many things propounded vnto him, one of the principall was, that he ſhould ſerue leapers, and dwell in their houſe when he ſhould be commanded: conſidered withall that S. Francis himſelfe did the ſame with much contentment of body and ſpiritt, and with him all his beloued and holy Religious. And in regard that the holy Father was very zealous ofS. F. care of the churches. the honour of the moſt bleſſed Sacrament, he would that not only the altares, but euen the churches and houſe of God, were conuenient, neat and well ordered: and if he found any one vncleane, he would ſweep it himſelfe, or if he could not, he would commaund ſome Brethren to make cleane and accommodate the ſame, that by this worck of God they might nouriſh in themſelues humilitie,2. Cor. 6. a reuerence to his diuine maieſtie, and feruonr of ſpiritt, to enrich with him, the conſcience of all the ſoules of faithfull Chriſtians, which are the true temples of the liuing God.
               
               
                  Of the doctrine and documents of S. Francis.
                  THE XXXI. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Francis did often make ſpirituall lectures to his children in IESVS CHRIST, putting them in mind of their profeſsion, and the ſtate whervnto God had ſo graciously called them, which he performed by theſe wordes: My welbeloued Brethren, lett vs haue alwayes before our eyes the firſt vocation wherto, with ſo greatInstructions of S. F. vnto his Br. going through the world 1. Pet. 2.
                      mercie, we haue bin called of God, not only to ſaue our ſelues, but alſo for the ſaluation of many. And ſith it is ſo, lett vs trauaile ouer the world, with good example and behoufull wordes exhorting and teaching euery one, that ſinners may repent their ſinnes paſt, and call to minde the diuine preceptes, which they ſeeme to haue already forgotten. Now whiles you thus trauaile, you ought to haue a firme faith that God will procure you to encounter faithfull men, gentle and gracious, who will of charity receiue you ioyfully, and you ſhall gaine them. When you ſhall meet with vnfaithfull and proud perſonnes that ſhall reſiſt your ſpeeches, ſupport them with patience and humilitie, for theloue of him, who being iniuryed, miſpriſed, and diſhonoured by the Iewes, did not anſweare them one croſſe, word, nor would reuenge himſelfe of the outrages which they had done him, but preſented himſelfe with an extreme charitie to ſupport all, in ſatisfaction of our ſinnes.
                  
                     
When S. Francis ſent his brethren to any place, he gaue them this document. Haue alwayes humility and honeſtie in your company, and in the morning till the third hower, keepe ſilence ſtrictlie, and in the meane while offer your deuotion and pray to God in your hart. Vtter not wordes that are idle and without fruit, neither doe you giue eare vnto them: becauſe in whatſoeuer place you walke or be, your conuerſation ought to be no leſſe humble and modeſt then if you were in your oratory or cell, ſith that where ſoeuer we goe or be, we haue alwayes with vs our cell which is our body, wherof our ſoule is the hermite, which reſideth therin to pray vnto God and to meditate on his benefittes. And therfore if the ſoule reſt not in peace in this celle, that of the monaſtery will litle auaile vnto a Brother: Liue in ſuch ſort as no man be ſcandalized att you: but that each one by your ſweetnes be induced to peace, to benignity and concord: conſidering that to this end we be called, to witt, to cure the wounded, to reduce thoſe that erre, into the right way, and to make vnion where there was diuiſion, faſtening them together with the ſweet nayles of the feare of God.
                  He afterward explicated vnto them the ſtate of the Freer Minors, ſaying: The Religion of the Freer Minors is a nett, that taketh the great fiſhes for God, and letteth the leſſer eſcape: and the life and religion of the Freer Minors is a little flock and fold of ſheep, which the Sonne of God hath deſired his heauenlie Father to giue vnto him in this later time, which were a people repleniſhed with humility, and with ſo abiect a pouerty, that they were different from all other, and were content to poſſes no other thing in this world but himſelfe, in regard that his Father had giuen them vnto him. Herevnto he added that for this reſpect, God had commanded him in a reuelation to callWhy the Religious of S. Fr. were firſt called Freer Minors. his Religious Freer Minors, becauſe they were the poore people which he had required of his Father, to whome in his goſpell he ſpake in theſe tearmes: Feare not my litle flock, for it hath pleaſed the Father to giue you the eternall kingdome. And albeit this hath bin vnderſtood in the perſon of all the poore of ſpiritt: yet was it particulerly ſpoaken concerning the Religion of the Freer Minors, who were to renew in the church the primitiue eſtate of the Apoſtles. Thus did the holy Father encourage them, without feare to trauaile ouer the world, ſecurely to denounce, and ſimplie to preach pennance, repoſing their confidence in God who had vanquiſhed the world, who would ſpeake for gayning of ſoules for them and in them, by meane of the holy Ghoſt. But lett vs eſpecially haue care, ſaid the holy Father, we that haue already abandoned the world, that we looſe not the celeſtiall kingdome, for a matter of ſmall moment; I therfore further

aduiſe you, that if you find mony in any place wher ſoeuer, you eſteeme it no more then the duſt you trample vnder your feet.
                  
                     The Freer Minors ought not to contemnenor condemne any man. The ſaid S. did afterward admoniſh them not to contemne any perſon, that they ſhould ſee to liue licentiously or cloathed ſumptuously: conſidering that God is our common Lord, who is of ſufficient power to call and iuſtifie them. For which reaſon he would that his Religious ſhould yeld them equall reuerence with their fellow Brethren and Lordes: for they are as well and really theire brothers in regard of reaſonable eſſence, ſith we are all creatures of one ſame and ſole Creatour and Redeemer, and they are alſo their Lordes, in as much as they aſsiſt them in their courſe of life and releiue them in their neceſsities. He farther affirmed that the Freer Minor ought to be ſuch in the world, that in whatſoeuer he ſhould ſee or heare in the world, he ſhould glorifie the heauenly Father. The Brethren one day beſought the holy Father that he would be pleaſed to manifeſt vnto them what vertue would make a man the greateſt freind to IESVSWhat vertue was moſt recomended by S. Fra. CHRIST, and he anſweared them: My Brethren, pouerty, my Brethren, pouerty, my Brethren, pouerty. Know for certaine, that it is the ſinguler way to perfection, the ſtemme or ſtock of humility, and that God would that therevpon ſhould begin the ſtructure and building of perfection, ſaying: If thou wilt be perfect, goe and ſell all that thou haſt: becauſe therby, the greateſt impedimentes are cutt off, to witt, the affection and cogitations of temporall ſubſtance (ordinarily
                        Matt. 19. accompanyed with pride) and vaine glory of the world, which breed of richeſſe, as the moth engendreth in cloth. Our Lord alſo declareth this eminencie of pouerty, to be the ſeat of all other vercues, when he ſaith: He that will liue with me, lett him renounce himſelfe, and
                        Matt. 16. take vp his croſſe and follow me. Becauſe he that is perfectly poore ought not only to forſake all loue and deſire of temporall thinges, but alſo the loue of himſelfe, of his proper iudgement, of his prudence, and of his owne will: that hauing no propriety in any thing, he may enter into the merueillous puiſſances of God, and preſent himſelfe nakedlie into his ſweet embracementes. In the diſcourſe which S. FrancisPrayer ſingulerly recomended by S. Francis. made to his Brethren, he did alſo commend in a Religious the vertue and grace of prayer: affirming that without the ſame none could perſeuer or profitt in the ſeruice of God: he therfore exerciſed and induced his Brethren to prayer, by all meanes he could deuiſe, perſuading them to pray alwayes, trauailling or reſting in one place a broad or within, in comfort and affliction, and that they ſhould doe al things with their ſpiritt erected vnto God, who is alwayes preſent in all places and within vs, 
                        •
                     and will that we continuallie conuerſe with him, for feare that by our negligence and tepidity, we depriue our

ſelues of the veritie of his holy ſpiritt, not receiuing it with due reuerence.
               
               
                  Of the austere life of S. Francis.
                  THE XXXII. CHAPTER.
                  THe bleſſed Father knowing that he was giuen of God, for an example and light vnto the Gentiles and worldly Chriſtians, &amp; that many by his meane, carrying the croſſe of our Redeemer, ſhould be ſaued, as a captaine of the warre of IESVS CHRIST, he endeauoured to gett the crowne of victory by worckes of perſeuerance in perfection: and reflecting on theſe words of the Apoſtle,
                        Galat. 5. They that appertaine to IESVS CHRIST, haue crucified their fleſh, with their vices alſo, to carry the armour of God in their bodies; he crucified his fleſh with the rigour of diſcipline, and ſo bridled his appetites, that touching his refection, he ſcarcely tooke what was neceſſarie to ſuffice nature. And as one that had wellA memorable ſpeech of S. Franc. experienced the matter, he affirmed it to be a thing verie difficult, to ſatisfie the neceſsitie of the body, without obeying the diſordinate inclinations of ſenſuall delight. In the beginning of the Order, albeit he had not ſufficient almoſe of bread to releiue his Brethren, yet for the moſt part he demaunded no more, becauſe himſelfe and his Brethren were ſo attentiue and addicted to the ſpiritt and to prayer, that out of forgetfulnes they omitted to demaund almoſe, and therfore refected themſelues with hearbes and rootes, which they did eate with exceeding good appetit, and great contentment. The holy Father in his health did very ſeldome, or almoſt neuer eate any meat dreſſed by fier. His ordinarie repaſt was bread and water, and if att any time he did eat of ſuch, it was of boyled hearbes, which he ſo mingled with aſhes or cold water, that looſing their ſauour, they were worſe then raw, and drincking water, he toke only ſo much as he thought would ſuffice him, not to quenchS. F. and his Religious during his life did alwayes eate on the groūd the heat of his thirſt, but to ſatisfie the neceſsitie of his body. His ordinarie table was the ground, neither had his Brethren other during his life. He euerie day inuented and found ſome extraordinary manner of abſtinence, ſo atttentiue and regardfull was he to chaſtice the fleſh, and to render it obedient to reaſon, that it might not hinder the profitable progreſſe of the ſoule.
                  He deuided the yeare into diuers Lentes, all which he faſted auſterelie, and firſt, the Lent which our Lord, faſted which beginneth

from the Epiphanie, this great ſeruant of God faſted it inThe Lēts which S. F. faſted euery yeare. the honour and example of IESVS CHRIST, very ſecretly with great ſilence, and very ſtrict abſtinence of bread and water. Then, incontinently after Eaſter, he kept an other Lent, to ſolemniſe the feaſt of the holy Ghoſt, in which he prepared himſelfe in example of the Apoſtles for ſo great a comming. An other he made in honour of the Apoſtles S. Peter and S. Paul: an other from the feaſt of the ſaid Apoſtles, to the aſſumption of the virgin Mary. After this Lent, he faſted till the feaſt of S. Michaell the Archangell. Beſides the foreſaid Lentes, he very auſterely faſted the Aduent: He left it as a precept to all his Brethren to faſt it, from the day after the feaſt of Alſaintes, according to the ſame forme of the quality of meat which himſelfe vſed.What poore are theeues.
                  
                  Touching the reſt of his auſtere life, it may be conceaued by that, which he ſaid of himſelfe: I was neuer theefe in demaunding almoſe ſuperfluously: yea I haue alwayes taken leſſe of that which I needed, therby not to fruſtrate other poore: becauſe if I ſhould haue done otherwiſe, I ſhould haue condemned my ſelfe of manifeſt theft. Notwithſtanding when he trauailed he did accommodate himſelfe toDiſcretiō of the S. Matt. 10.
                      their diett who gaue him entertainement in their houſe, according to the goſpell, in ſuch ſort that both faſting and eating he alwayes edified his neighbour. If in his ſicknes he were conſtrayned to eat fleſh, from the time of his recouery he would for pennance double his ordinarie abſtinence. In regard wherof, Brother Giles would commonly, ſay, that if S. Francis had a body ſound and ſtronge as he deſired, all the world together had not equaliſed him for ſufferance and patience in auſterityes. But becauſe the merite and nobleneſſe of vertue conſiſteth not only in the party of the body, but of the ſpiritt: therfore by how much his bodilie force did faile, ſo much were the feruours of his ſpiritt refortified, ſo that they exceeded without compariſon, his naturall forces, and that was his great crowne: And therfore appearing one day to Brother Giles, and telling him that he deſired to ſpeake foure wordes vnto him, he anſweared and ſaid, learne firſt with thy ſelfe that which thou wouldeſt ſay to me. Beſides, the bare &amp; hard ground was the ordinary bed ofHow he ſlept. this poore, wearyed, and trauailed body, and his pillow was a ſtone, or a peece of wood: yet did he oftē sleep ſitting, in reſpect wherof his body had very ſmall eaſe &amp; repoſe in his sleep: for he ſpēt the moſt part of the night in prayer: Wherto he aroſe whiles the other Br. slept, whē he was with thē. His habitt was one only coat, with the capuce of very rude &amp; boyſterous cloth, and ſometimes breeches and the corde. As he hatedHis habit. delicate cloathing, ſo did he extremely affect that which was rude

                     
                        Matt. 11. and rough, ſaying: that S. Iohn was for that exceedingly prayſed of God, in theſe wordes, that the cuſtome of delicate cloathing is in the Courtes of Princes, and not in the houſes of the poore: If therfore the holy Father felt any complacence in his habitt as being neat or whole, he would incontinently quilt it within with groſſe threed. He affirmed that he knew of certaine that the diuels did admire att the obſeruance of a difficult and auſtere life, and that on the contrary, they violentlie tempted thoſe that were cloathed delicatelie.
                  
                     A graue anſweare of S. Fra. Being one day demaunded how he could endure the ſharpnes of winter in ſo poore and ſimple habitt; he anſweared couragiously: If we were cloathed within with the flame of God, we ſhould moſt eaſily ſupport this cold without, and greater then ordinary if it ſhall happen. But becauſe he knew that all his Brethren were not capable of the like ſufferance, he ſaid that the true ſeruant of God ought to gouerne himſelfe with much diſcretion in his drincking and eating,S. F. was not ſo rigorous to his Brethren as to himſelfe. Pſal. 21.
                      and in the vſe of all other thinges neceſſarie to the entertainement of the body, and in ſuch ſort that he gaue it not occaſion to murmure, that it hath not ſtrength, not only to pray and labour with the reſt, but euen not to ſtand on foot, and when he ſhall haue done that, if the body doe afterward play the iade, become lazie and drowſie when it ſhould pray, lett him rudelie chaſtice it, and therfore he ought in all his neceſsities to haue alwayes recourſe to his ſuperiours and humbly demand them: And if he doe not obtaine them, he ought to beare it patiently for the loue of God, who alſo prayed
                        Matt. 26. his Father and was not heard; and lett him vndoubtedly beleeue that a neceſsity voluntarily ſuffered for the loue of God, is reputedNeceſsity voluntarily ſupported is a kind of martirdome. vnto him as a martyrdome: and if his body be therby endomaged, the fault is not his: but it is the will of God. Notwithſtanding theſe ſo milde documents for others, he ſubdued his one body with an incredible rigour: in regard wherof ſome few dayes before his death, he of conſcience, asked it pardon for hauing ſo rigourously treated it: and alleaged for excuſe, that he had not done it out of hatred vnto it, but for its greater ſecurity, and for the glorie of God.
               
               
                  
                  Of preſeruing the treaſure of chaſtitie, and how he afflicted himſelfe and caſt himſelfe into a pitt full of ſnow.
                  THE XXXIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe bleſſed Father liued with an extreame rigour and ſharpnes of diſcipline, to conſerue the virginall ſplendor of chaſtity, very diligently enflaming the interiour and exteriour man. For this cauſe in the beginning of his conuerſion, he often times, during the winter ſeaſon, caſt himſelfe all naked in the middes of ſnowes or on the ice, that he might perfectly ſubdue his domeſticall ennemy the fleſh, and conſerue the ſhining robe of immaculate virginity, from the fire of ſenſuality, not permitting it long reſidence therin, as by this example ſhall appeare. Being one day in the hermitage Lautiauo, making his prayer in a celle apart, the deuill called him thriſe, ſaying: Francis, Francis, Francis: to whome thoughe the S. anſweared, yet knew he not who called him. The deuill then ſaid vnto him: there is no ſinner inThe Deceipt of the deuill to weary firme reſolutions Iob. 41.
                      the world whome God doth not pardon if he conuert himſelfe: but he that ſhall kill himſelfe by ouer rigorous pennance, ſhall neuer finde mercie before the face of God. The holy Father then knew the deceipt of the wicked ennemye, hidden vnder the ſweetnes of thoſe wordes: and he knew it the more apparantly, in that att the ſame inſtant by the loathſome breath of that foule dragon, which enflameth the coales of hell, he had a vehement temtation of the fleſh: which the louer of chaſtitie feeling, he diſcloathed himſelfe, and with his corde very ſharpelie beate himſelfe, ſaying: Goe to, Brother aſſe, this kindnes I muſt ſhewStrange mortification of S. Fra. against a carnall temptation. thee, it is requiſite that thus I ſerue thee to make thee know thy ſelfe: and ſith chaſticementes and ſtripes doe pleaſe thee more then faſting and auſteritie of life, thou ſhalt ſurely haue it (conſider here the habitt of religion, which ſigniſieth ſanctitie, it was not permitted to ſence to ſteale it away.) And if thou deſire to be gon, get thee now thus whipt whither thou wilt. Goeing then foorth of his cell, he threw himſelfe on the ſnow, and incontinentlie made ſeauen boules of the ſnow which he ſett before him, and ſaid: behold, my bodie, the greateſt of theſe boules is thy wife, and theſe four are two daughters and two ſonnes which ſhe hath conceiued by thee, and the other two are a man and maid ſeruant that are to ſerue thee, take them now and gett them cloathing, for they faint with cold. And if this new ſolicitude be troubleſome to thee, content thy ſelfe to ſerue one ſole maſter, who is much more eaſy to pleaſe then this fleſh. Thus was the deuill confounded, the temptation croſled, and the holy Father was in ſuch ſort victorious, that the deuill durſt no more to viſitt him with the like tentations.
                  
                     
By this ſo generous act of reſiſtance againſt the fleſh he left to his diſciples, a documente and example to reſiſt ſenſuall temptations, not only by prayer, but alſo by corporall labours, with rigour and aſperitie, accompained with abondance of teares, and not deliciouslie as the worldlie and carnall would gladlie doe, and without any labour that might be any way troubleſome, nor much leſſe with cold purpoſes rather then actes of the will, wherin certaine ſpirituall perſonnes that are tender and delicate place their force and knowledg. Wherefore it is not to be admired, if they be alwayes feeble and imperfect, becauſe they ſhall euer proue ſuch, whiles they omitt the corporall exerciſe of the vertues, and of the ſteppes of their ſpirituall Father and maſter. To the end therfore that this example might profitt vs, God would that whiles the Seraphicall S. was employed heerin, a Brother that was in prayer ſaw and heard all that paſſed, by reaſon that the moone did ſhine: which being perceaued by the holie Father, he recounted vnto him the cauſe, which was the temptation, but with commandement, not to diſcouer it to any perſon of the world, during his life.
               
               
                  Of the guard and vigilancie he taught to be had of our ſences.
                  THE XXXIIII. CHAPTER.
                  
                     S. Fra. would not that his Bre. should frequent or behold women. Ierem. 9.
                      SAint Francis did not only teach how one ought to mortifie the vices of the fleſh, and to bridle our ſēſuall appetites, but alſo with what ca
                        •
                     e one ought to gard the exteriour ſences, by meanes wherof death entreth the into the ſoule, to the end that the Brethren might keep more ſecurely the ineſtimable treaſure of chaſtity, though in ſo britle a veſſell of earth: he did verie dilligently admoniſh them, and did prohibite them the amitie and conuerſation of women, which hath bin oftentimes the ruine of many. He aſſuredly affirmed that through the like occaſiōs the weake man doth fall, and the ſtrong is weakened. It is as difficult for a man that is no more then perfect to preſerue himſelfe from theſe thinges, as to walke and goe bare-foot on burning coales without burning. For this cauſe, he kept his ſences ſo retired and ſequeſtred, and particulerlie his eyes from beholding the vanities of the world, that, according to what he one day ſaid, he ſcarce knew any woman by ſight, becauſe he affirmed that it was not verie ſecure to imprint in his memory the image of a figure that might make greater the leaſt ſparckle of ſenſuality, mortified by the aſhes of penance, or to admitt and yeld vnto it any thing that might afterward ſtaine the purity and ſplendour of the chaſt ſoule: and therfore it is not

to be admired, if he attained to ſuch perfection of chaſtitie, conſidering that he made ſuch cruell warre againſt his ſences, that it ſeemed he had obtayned a perfect and ſoueraine dominion ouer his fleſh, and, in imitation of an other Iob, had made a compact with his eyes, that he would not only haue in horrour the ſight of thinges perillous,
                        Iob. 32. but euen of ſuch as were vaine and curious. He admoniſhed his Brethren, that it was not expedient for them to giue care to the ſpeeches of women, whereby the ſoule of the vertuous becommeth effeminate and feeble, excepting in confeſsion, and when it ſhalbe neceſſary, to giue them ſome breife inſtruction for the good of their ſoules. What occaſion may a Brother haue, ſaid he, that may force him to frequent women, vnleſſe when he is required to heare their confeſsion, or to diſcourſe with them touching penance, or to giue them ſome counſaile for the benefitt of their ſoule? A man that preſumeth of ouer much ſecuritie hath leſſe regard of his ennemy, who hauing power to ſurpriſe him doth not ſpare him. Thus did the holie Father loue and deſire in his Brethren aboue all thinges, next vnto the foundation of holy pouertie and humilitie, modeſtie and mortification of the eyes; to giue them therfore a more apparant inſtruction how to gouerne them, he once vſed vnto them this parabole. A parabe le which S. Fran. vſed to his Bret. touching mortification of the eyes.
                  
                  There was a potent and iuſt king, that ſent two pages one after an other to deliuer a meſſage vnto the Queene his wife: the firſt retourning to the king his maſter, made his anſweare ſimplie, becauſe out of modeſtie he had forborne to behold the countenance of the queene his miſtris: the ſecond page making his anſweare to the king, commended the beautie of the Queene, ſaying: Verilie, ſir, the Queene is the moſt beautifull and pleaſing woman that is vnder heauen; and in truth you ought to repute your ſelfe happy in hauing ſuch a woman to your eſpouſe. The king hearing this ſaid: How haſt thou dared, thou lewd fellowe, ſo vnchaſtly to behold my wife? thou haſt coueted the pourchaſe of what thou ſo attentiuelie haſt beheld. Therevpon he preſentlie recalled the other page, of whom he demaunded what his opinion was of his wife, he anſweared: Syr I eſteeme exceeding well of her: for ſhe gaue a very willing eare to what I deliured in your behalfe. The, king replyed to this diſcreet anſweare, and ſaid: haſt thou obſerued her grace, doſt thou thinck there can be any thing more deſired or added to the beautie of her countenance? The page anſweared: Syr it appertaineth vnto you to iudge of that. My duetie was to deliuer her my meſſage and to bring you the anſweare. Which the king vnderſtanding, thus ordayned, and ſaid: it is moſt probable that thou who haſt bin ſo chaſt of they eyes, wilt proue more chaſt

of body: thou therfore ſhalt be of my chamber, and eſpecially fauoured. But as for this preſumptuous brazen-face, I will that he be diſmiſſed for feare of committing further miſcheife. S. Francis hereof inferred that the Brethren beholding a woman ought to eſteeme and be perſuaded, that it is this ſame Queene, the eſpouſe of IEVS CHRIST, and themſelues to be the firſt page. And in this manner he very clearly demonſtrated vnto them by his life and doctrine, the virginall purity wherin God did alwayes conſerue him in the middes of worldly vanities, and that he had ſuch ſpeciall care therof, that he deſerued to haue the ſacred woundes of our Redeemer engrauen on this his pure and virginall fleſh. Wherof Brother Leo gaue teſtimony, who notwithſtanding that he was his Confeſſour, being curious to be confirmed therin, did neuertheles in his prayer demaund the ſame of our lord IESVS CHRIST, who by diuine reuelation aſcertayned him therof: for he ſhortlie after ſaw the holie Father in ſpiritt on a high mountaine in a moſt beautifull garden; among roſes and lilies, hauing his handes full of them. He was hereby aduertiſed, that what he ſaw on this mountaine was the ſainct regiſtred in heauen with the virgines, not only of body, but euen of ſpiritt and will.
               
               
                  How the holy Father taught his Bretbren to shunne idlenes.
                  THE XXXV. CHAPTER.
                  HE a boue all other thinges taught, both by doctrine and example, that idlenes ought to be ſhunned, as a principall cauſe of lewd cogitations, and corrupter of vertue: ſhewing by example of his life, with what diligence one ought to exerciſe the fleſh by fruitfull mortificatiō, in regard that it is addicted to sloath, and is rebellious. And therfore he called the body litle aſſe, as one that ought to be ſubiected to the ordinary ſupporting of the burdens of labours, not making reſiſtance, and that it ought to be chaſticed with ſtripes, and nouriſhed with very courſe and rude meates. If by chaunce he ſaw any loitring and idle perſon, that would eat of an others labour, he ſaid that he ought to be called Brother Fly: becauſe, not doeing any good, but diſtayning and hindering the good worckes of others, he ought to be reputed contemptible and abhominable.
                  In the beginning of the inſtitution of the order, to giue example of exerciſe vnto his Brethren, he trauailed alone to ſeeke almoſe, wherin he extremelie laboured his body that was already very ſickly. He ſpent the night in watchinges and continuall prayers, and the day in reading the office, in ſeruing and preaching in the townes and villages, or in adminiſtring

to leapers, or decking and triming the churches. It ſucceeded afterward that many Brethren, who were not fitt to keep the quire, did liue of the labours of others, as of Brother Giles, Brother Ginipero, and ſome others who were imployed in certaine profitable occupations, to ſhuune the capitall ennemy of the life and ſoule: thence it proceeded that they had ſufficient almoſe for themſelues and for others. Neither would he permitt his Brethren to giue eare to newes and relation of ſeculer matters, that they came not, by omitting the contemplation and taſt of celeſtiall thinges, to employ themſelues in vaine and worldly thinges, which they had already abandoned. It was not permitted to any of them to relate what he heard abroad. All they that were nere S. Francis, were aſwell by night as day exerciſed in diuine prayſes: wherin they rather ſeemed Angels thē men. In this ſort did they maintaine the ſchoole of the holy Father, in labour and exerciſes of the ſpiritt. Among the ſaid Brethren it was held a great ſinne, for one to take his recreation and pleaſure in any other thing then the conſolation of the ſpiritt. The holy Father affirmed, that the negligent and sloathfull that applyed not themſelues to any exerciſe, ſhould be incō
                     tinently vomited out of the mouth of God. And if he mett with any
                        Apoc. 3. ſuch, he would incontinently reprehend him, as one that by his example of perfectiō was in continuall exerciſe, to the end that in his ſchoole none ſhould looſe any part of ſo great a benefitt as is time, which is giuen vs by our lord IESVS CHRIST.
                  After his refection he accuſtomed with his Brethren to vſe ſome exerciſe, to auoyd idlenes, that when afterwardes they were to pray, they might not, by meane of their vnfruitfull wordes then vttered, looſe the gifte and recompence which they had merited att the handes of God. So, the more to ſhunne idlenes, he gaue this rule, that by his commandement all the Brethren that ſhould vtter any idle word conuerſing orThe recreations of the Freer Minors which S. Francis ordayned them. trauayling together, ſhould be obliged to ſay one Pater, and to praiſe God in the beginning and end to the benefitt of the ſoule of the culpable, cōditionally that he firſt acknoledged his fault before he were reprehēded by others. But if he were firſt admoniſhed and reprehēded by an other, the ſaid Pater noſter ſhould be for the ſoule of the reprehender. And if the culpable would not admitt the admonitiō and penāce, mayntainning his ſpeech not to be idle, the holy Father ordayned, that he ſhould be obliged to redouble the ſaid penāce, and now to ſay twice the Pater noſter, once for the reprehēder, and once for him that ſhould iudge his worde to be idle or vnprofitable. Now the prayſes which he ordayned to be ſaid before and after the Pater noſter, he would they ſhould be vttered with ſuch and ſo diſtinct a voice, that it might be vnderſtood of all the Brethren there preſent, who ſhould then be ſilent to heare

the prayſe of God: and if any one then ſpake, he ſhould in like manner be obliged to ſay Pater noſter for him that was to praiſe. He would that all the Brethren entring into any houſe or other place: and caſually meeting one an other, ſhould prayſe God, ſaying God be prayſed, or ſome like wordes. This Seraphicall Father was accuſtomed to giue theſe honoures to God with a moſt zealous feruour, and deſired that all his Brethren ſhould be carefull and religious in doeing the like.
               
               
                  How he was ennemye to murmuringe, and how he reprehended it.
                  THE XXXVI. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father extremely abhorred murmurers, the venimous fruit of murmures growing of the peſtiferous tree of idlenes, yea he ſhunned them aboue all other kind of vicious perſonnes, affirming them to haue a moſt mortall venime in the topp of their tongue, wherewith they empoyſon men both preſent and abſent. Wherefore hauing one day heard a Brother offending the reputation of an other, he tourned to Brother Peter Catanio, and crying with a loud voice, he vttered theſe wordes: Diſcorde, beginneth to enter into religion, if detractours be not chaſticed with diſcipline, and if theſe loathſome mouthes be not ſtopt, the ſweet odour of the good, will incontinently be infected. Ariſe, ariſe ſpeedily, and dilligently examine the matter: and if thou finde the offended Brother innocent, chaſtice the murmurer ſharpely, that he ſerue for an example to all others. And ſo I will that all Gardiens and Miniſters be verie vigillant, that this peſtiferous infirmitie take not root in religion. To this purpoſe he often ſaid, that whoſoeuer did fruſtrate his Brother of his glory and fame, merited to be depriued of the habitt of the order, and of all power euer to lift vp his eyes to God, till he had to his power reſtored the honour taken from his Brother. He further affirmed, that the crueltie of detractors exceeded that of murderers, in regard of the law of IESVS CHRIST, which is not accompliſhed but in charitie, and doth more oblige vs to deſire the good of the ſoule, thē of the body.
                  In this reſpect the Brethren from that holie time, as obedient children, that deſired to accompliſh the iuſt will of their Father, were with their beſt induſtrie warie therof, becauſe to murmure, what other thing is it (ſaid the ſame holie Father) then with the gall of
                        Geneſ. 9. diſhonour and treaſon to fill holie religion his true and deere mother? Such murmurers are of the curſed race of Cham: for as he diſcouered the nuditie of his Father, ſo theſe diſcouer and aggrauate

the defectes of their Superiours and of the Order. Therfore they deſerue the malediction of God, they wallow in filth like hogges, and ſeeke to lay falſe imputations on their Brethren, and to make them like vnto themſelues, who haue their conſciences exceedingly defiled and loathſome, their office is conformable to that of dogges, to bite, to barck, and to complaine of the order of the Superiours and of the diſcipline. The voice of the murmurer is thus: I want perfection of life and true knowledge, I cannot attaine to taſt the ſweetnes of God, and therfore I cannot find place neere his diuine Maiſtie, nor repoſe with men. I am reſolued what to doe, I will raiſe diſcord amōg the elect, and the good people, and I ſhalbe fauoured of the principall, ſo much the rather becauſe I know my Superiour to be a man, and that alſo, as I doe, he ſometimes vſeth this meanes. Oh wretch: thou feedeſt already on humane fleſh: why ſeekeſt thou not they food other where? thou gnaweſt the liuer and bowels of thoſe that liue well. Thoſe fellowes ſeeke to ſeeme vertuous, not to be ſo, and accuſe the vices of others, without indeauouring in the meane time co correct their owne. They praiſe onlie them of whome they are praiſed, or of whome they hope ſome benefitt: yet doe they not prayſe them, but when they thincke or know it will come to their vnderſtanding, and that themſelues ſhalbe commended therfore.
                  The holie ▪Father thus laboured with all his power to root out of his Order ſo many occaſions of euels as arriue by an vnbridled tongue, to the end his Brethren might obſerue the Euangelicall ſilence. And in that reſpect he hath att times exhorted them to auoid idle wordes, as ſuch wherof one ſhould render an account, and be puniſhed for, in the
                        Matth. 12. great and dreadfull day of iudgement: and if he mett with any one that ſhould forgett himſelfe in this point, he would verie ſharplie reprehend him: aſſuring his Brethren, that holie ſilence was the gard and cōſeruation of the purity of the hart, that it was not one of the leaſt vertues,Prou. 18. &amp; Matt. 12.
                      and that ſo slight regard ought not to be made therof, ſith the Scripture ſaith, that death and life are in the power of the tongue.
               
               
                  Of the ſpirituall ioy, he would that his Brethren should haue.
                  THE XXXVII. CHAPTER.
                  HE had an eſpeciall care that his Brethen in their prayers, diuine offices, and corporall exerciſes, ſhould euer haue interiourly ſome ſpirituall ioy againſt the venime of idlenes and melācholy, &amp; as a ſigne that they were the habitatiō of Ieſus Chriſt. He did with all ſingularly affect in them this peace and alacrity of ſpiritt: he aſſured

them that this ſpirituall ioy was directly oppoſite to all kinde of deceipt and temptation of the deuill, and ſaid vnto them: that if the ſeruaunt of God did labour to conſerue in him interiourly and exteriourly the alacrity which ſpringeth of the purity of the ſoule as his proper foūtaine, which is cauſed by the vertue of prayer, the deuilles cannot annoy him: for they will ſay, If this man be ioyfull in afflictions and trauailes, by what meanes can we procure him euill? And on the contrary, when the deuill ſeeth the ſeruaunt of God diſarmed of this ſpirituall alacrity, he hopeth with all to make him looſe the taſt of prayer, and of all his other good worckes, and eſpecially of the puritie of the ſoule: for he well knoweth with what temptations and by what slightes he can endommage and robbe the peace of the ſpiritt, and of the good diſpoſition which is in the ſeruaunt of God. But this miſcheuious beaſt ſhall haue leſſe power, when the ſoule ſhalbe dilligent to expell this heauines by the vertue of prayer, which as a moſt pleaſing odour hath power to chace far a way from her, this fierce and venimous ſerpent: but when the hart is oppreſſed with griefe and heauines, the deuill reioyceth becauſe he very eaſily plongeth him into melancholy or into diſpaire, or perſuadeth it to wallow in worldly pleaſures.
                  Thus did the holy Father exceedingly labour, to preſerue the ioy of the hart, which is the oyle of ſpirituall vnction, wherwith the holy Ghoſt annoynteth thoſe whom he hath ſanctiſied: and thereby preuenteth the dangerous diſeaſe of idlenes and of ſpirituall diſtaſt, which the Sainct with ſuch dilligence endeauoured to exterminate, that when he felt it to breed in him, he had incontinently recourſe to prayer, as to a moſt aſſured remedy and preſeruatiue againſt ſo perillous a diſeaſe. He counſailed his Brethren in like ſort when they felt themſelues troubled, to haue inſtant recourſe to prayer, and being on their knees proſtrate on the earth before God, to ſay: Reſtore me, if thou pleaſe my God, that grace which thou wert pleaſed formerly to graunt vnto my ſoule, whereto I beſeech thee to giue that alacrity and raſt which it felt in thy holy ſeruice, and comfort me by the ſame that I do not periſh: and he admoniſhed them thus to perſeuer till they were heard, and that their former ioy retourned vnto them. For ſaid he, if the ſoule permitt it ſelfe to be tranſported to heauines of ſpiritt, the vice of confuſion of Babilon will grow in it, which ruſtieth the hart and ſilleth it with ſorrow, if it be not waſhed with teares. And know yee (ſaid this good Father) that the alacrity which proceedeth of a good conſcience and of vnion with God by prayer, is one of the principall giftes which one is to receiue, and receaued ought to conſerue. Labour then all of you to obtaine it, ſith I loue it for my ſelfe, and deſire it for you, both exteriourly and interiourly for the glory of God, and the greater confuſion of the deuill,

who only and his haue occaſion to be melancholie: wheras we on the contrary ought to reioyce in God. I know well that the deuilles beare me enuie, and that they cannot, but againſt their wil, endure ſo many graces to be imparted vnto me by his diuine maieſty: and ſeeing they can not annoye me, they endeauour to trouble my fellow-brethren: but they leſſe preuayling therin, if it pleaſe God, they ſhall depart with confuſion. If ſometimes they tempt me with slugiſhnes, idlenes, and heauines of ſpiritt, I free me therof, by conſideration of the alacritie of my Brethren.
                  Now it is here to be vnderſtood, that the holie Father being an Idea and paterne of all true modeſtie, he did not meane that one ſhould ſhew a vaine ioy of ſpeech, or of light laughter: for that is not the alacritie which the true ſeruantes of IESVS CHRIST ought to haue (as ſome eſteeme) which is but a vanitie and a manifeſt ſigne of litle ſpiritt. S. Francis therfore, in an exhortation that he made to his Brethren, declaredWhat ought to be the ioy of the true ſeruant of God. Iacob. 1.
                      vnto them, what was the ioy of the true ſeruantes of God, ſaying: That Brother may be called happy, who hath not his ioy but in worckes and wordes of charity, by example and document wherof men are induced to loue, prayſe and honour God. And on the contrary, wretched is the Brother that is delighted in idle wordes, wher with he moueth men to laughter: in whome, that is verified which the Apoſtle ſaith, that his religion is vaine and vnfruitfull. So that by ſpirituall ioy he meant the feruour, reſolution, readines and taſt of the will &amp; of the bodye prompt with alacritie to attempt all good: by which feruour and ioy, men are oftentimes more edified then by the very worckes they doe, be they neuer ſo good, if they ſeeme to be done with an euill will: becauſe they repreſent the idlenes &amp; anxietie of the will and the sloathfullnes of the body in doeing well: ſo that they doe not edifie, but corrupt. The holy Father affected grauity in himſelfe and others, that the ioy of the ſpiritt might not ſeeme a certaine vaine mirth. He well knew by experience, that this grauity would ſerue him as a wall againſt the dartes of the deuill, becauſe the ſoule diſarmed therof remayneth light and vaine, and as a naked man amongſt potent ennemies, that ſeeke all meanes to murder him.
               
               
                  Of the fraternall vnion which he taught his brethren.
                  THE XXXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  ANd becauſe the ſaid ſpirituall ioy proceedeth of the innocencie of the ſoule, and of an amourous peace and▪ tranquillitie with God and our neighbour: S. Francis exceedinglie laboured, that ſo holy a vnion might be cōſerued amōg his deerly beloued diſciples to thend that they who had ben engendred by the holy Ghoſt in vnion

of loue and concorde, might be conſerued and maintayned, ſemblably vnited among themſelues, in the lappe of their mother, which is holy
                        Rom. 12. Religion. To the end alſo that the ſaid diſciples ſhould praiſe God with one hart, and according to the Apoſtle ſhould reioyce with the ioyfull, and mourne with the ſorrowfull, neuer permitting any roote of ſorrow, enuie, or any other diſordinate paſsion to enter into them: and that the greater ſhould be aſſuredly vnited in a true loue of charitye, with the leaſt, the prudent and wiſe with the ſimple, as true Brethren, and they that are in their country with ſuch as are come from farre. He one day propoſed to his Brethren an example, to this purpoſe, of notable doctrine and efficacie.
                  Suppoſing, ſaid he, that a generall chapter were held of all the Brethren that are in the glory of paradice, and as there are both learned and ſimple ignorantes, that haue vowed to ſerue God, without any ſcience acquyred: lett commandement be giuen to a learned man, and to a ſimple ignorant to make each of them a ſermon, the learned conſidering what he was to ſay, thus diſcourſed with himſelfe: where there are ſo many of perfect knowledge, it would be vnprofitable for me, to appeare learned, my auditours being incapable of further ſcience to premeditate to make election and ſearch of curious and ſubtill matters, before more curious then my ſelfe, would appeare ridiculous: but peraduenture I ſhalbe better and more voluntarily heard, yea and with more fruit, if I diſcourſe ſimply. Now the prefixed day being come, all the holy Saints aſſemble in the place deputed to heare the ſermon of the Doctour, who appeared cloathed with a rude ſack cloth, and his head couered with aſhes. Thoſe preſent more admired this habitt, then the wordes which were compendious, breife and ſimple in theſe termes: My Brethren, weA briefe, but fruitfull exhortatiō. haue promiſed great matters: but greaters are promiſed vs. Lett vs exactly performe thoſe: and tenderly aſpire att theſe. The pleaſure of ſinne is breife, but the paine therof is without end. The labour of vertue is ſmall: but the glory gotten therby is infinite. Many are called: but few are choſen, and each one in the end ſhall receiue according to his deſerte. Theſe ſo pregnant and patheticall wordes, did ſo touch and moue the hartes of the audience, that they were conſtrayned to ſhed abondance of teares, exceedingly prayſing this Preacher, and eſteeming him a holy perſon. The ſimple ignorant then that was alſo to preach, ſaid to himſelfe: Sith this learned Preacher hath made vſe in his ſermon of my ſimplicity, I know what I will doe: I haue ſome verſes of the Pſalter by hart, them will I ſett foorth the moſt eloquently and learnedly that I can, ſith that the doctour hath preached like a ſimple man. The houre of his ſermon being come, this ſimple man roſe vp, and repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt, he propounded his theme with

ſuch feruour, ſo ingeniously and clearly, yea with ſuch eloquence by the grace which God imparted vnto him, that his auditours filled with admiration, ſayd: Without doubt God doth ſpeake in the ſimple.
                  Now S. Francis expounded this figure in this manner: Our Religion, ſaid he, is a great and generall congregation, in which are vnited from all partes of the world a great nomber of men, vnder one ſame forme and rule of life: The prudent therein ought to make vſe of the grace that is in the idiotes, which is to be employed in worckes of humilitie, as true diſciples of IESVS CHRIST, and ſo to benefitt themſelues therby, when they ſhall ſee them exerciſed, with a liuely intention in celeſtiall vertues, and voluntarily to heare the myſticall doctrine of the holy Ghoſt, yea with a pious and holy enuy to reſemble them, and to cleare their ſpirittes of all preſumption, that they may be enriched of God, with the ſpiritt of humility and diuine theologie. On the contrary, the ſimple ought to be very carefull to make their profitt more of workes, then of doctrine and to conuert the ſcience which they ſee in the learned, into ſo much fruit, ſeeing the honour and reuerence which they exhibitt to the rule and to ſimplicity of life, whereas they being ſo noble and ſo learned, might liue in the world as Lordes, and yet they haue made themſelues litle, becauſe they had true knowledge of the greatnes of God. Then he  concluded that in this worthy concord conſiſted true peace, in this equalitie of hartes repoſed true ioye of ſpiritt, yea all the beautie and perfection of all their congregation, and that by this only meane they might become gratefull and pleaſing to the eternall Father, who as he had engendred them, and alwayes conſerued them in grace, would alſo afterward vnite them, together in glory.
               
               
                  How he accuſtomed his Brethren to perfect obedience.
                  THE XXXVIIII. CHAPTER.
                  BEſide the premiſes, he alſo trayned them vp in the vertue of obedience and abnegation of their owne will, alleaging vnto them the example of God himſelfe, who had no ſooner made man, but by precept he obliged him to obedience, forbidding him to eate of the aple of the knowledge of good and euill,
                        Gen. 2. &amp; 3. wherof not eating he did not ſinne, but as ſoone as he had tranſgreſſed his obedience, he condemned himſelfe and conſequentlie vs by the ſame fact. The Brother that appropriatelie to

priateth to himſelfe any thing of this tree of knowledge, guided by ſelfe-will which by the vow of obedience he hath already forſaken, and becommeth proud in regard of his ſubſtance already giuen to God, liuing without the yoke of obedience vnto his Superiour, ſuch a one; I ſay, doth apparantly diſcouer, that he yeldeth to the falſe perſwaſions of the deuill, ſith he is become a violatour and tranſgreſſour of his vow, to eate of the aple of ſelfe will, and by this meane he reſteth
                        Ioh. 12. condemned and expelled out of the paradice of Religion. For God ſaith in the ghoſpell: He that would ſaue his ſoule ſhall looſe it. Now, that man would ſaue his ſoule in this world, who deſireth to follow his owne fancie, vnderſtanding by the ſoule, the will which the ſaid Brother ought in ſuch ſort toforſake, as that though he could performe ſuch actes as might be better and more behoufull to his ſoule, then thoſe which his Superiour commandeth him, yet ought he to ſacrifice his will to God, and doe only that which his Superiour preſcribeth: therfore my beloued Brethren, as ſoone as you ſhall heare the firſt word of obedience, accompliſh it without attending an other replie, neither make you any excuſe, though the commandement ſeeme impoſsible, or that you be not obliged vnto it: for what ſoeuer is commanded you, allthough it exceed your power, yet obedience is of it ſelfe ſo puiſſant, that it will giue you ſupplie offorce to effect the ſame.
                  S. Francis being demanded by his Brethren, what was true obedience: he anſweared, that one could hardlie finde a man in the world ſo perfect, that he could entierlie obey his Superiour: and to confirme the ſame he alleadged an example of a dead man. Take (ſaid he) aCompariſon of a dead body to one truly obedient. dead man without ſoule and ſett him where you will, he doth not in any ſort contradict you, he reſiſteth not, if you chaunge his place he doth not murmure, if you ſett him downe he complayneth not, if you leaue him there, he doth there remaine: if you ſett him on a bench, he no more looketh vp then downe, if you cloath him with purple, he will not become the more proud: ſuch is the true obedient, that iudgeth not to haue chaunged place, and if any chardge be giuen him, the dignity maketh him not to forgett humilitie: but the more he is honoured, the more doth he eſteeme himſelfe vnworthy therof. Therfore, though this holy Father, as a good Euangelicall marchaunt, had by diuers meanes purchaſed diuine richeſſe, and employed the time preſent in meriting, yet would he not be ſuperiour, but a ſubiect: he would not command, but obey: that he might not only leaue vnto his Brethren the quality of a good Superiour, but of a good and obedient ſubiect alſo, that may liue a life of continuall martyrdome, when the Prelates are meere libertines. Therfore, when his Order began to multiply, he refuſed to be Generall therof, and did incontinently ſubmit himſelfe

to a Gardian whome he obeyed in all things, as in place proper we ſhall recount.
                  
                     Obedic̄ce is fruit full. He affirmed the fruit of Obedience to be ſo great, that they who ſubmitt thēſelues therto, doe not paſſe any moment without much merit. And therfore when he trauailed, he accuſtomed to promiſe obediēce vnto his companion which he performed, and herevpon ſometimes would ſay: Of all the graces that the diuine goodnes hath imparted vnto me, this is one of the principall, that I would as willingly obey a Nouice of one houres antiquitie, if he were appointed vnto me for Gardian,Great ſubmiſiō of the hohy Father. as to an old man of ſufficient iudgment and prudence: and I would as well content me with what ſoeuer he ſhould enioyne me, as if I were the meaneſt of all other: For the Brother being ſubiect as he is, ought not to conſider his Superiour as man: but as him for whoſe loue he is ſubiect vnto him: beſides, the leſſe worthy of honour the Superiour is, the more pleaſing is the humilitie of the obeyer vnto God. Yet did he not forbeare as Prelate, to aduertiſe the Superiours of his Order, that they ſhould rarelie charge vpon obedience, becauſe one ſhouid not incontinently proceed with ſuch thundering rigour, which ought alwayes to be the laſt, when no other meane can auayle: for one ought not vpon light acccaſion to lay the hand one the ſword. Then addreſsing himſelfe to his Brethren, he would ſay: He that will not obey with diligence, may be nombred among them that feare not God nor reſpect men. Now the one and the other of theſe opinions are true and worthyWhat a rash Superious is. to be marked, becauſe in a raſh man, auctority to command is no other thing then a ſword in the hand of one that is furious, &amp; there is no thinge more deſperate and incurable then a Brother without obedience: in reſpect wherof the holy Father deteſted pride as the originall of all kind of euils, and diſobedience as the eldeſt daughter therof. Not with ſtanding he did not reiect the humble penance of the diſobient Brother, when he performed the ſame, as by the enſuying chapter ſhall appeare.
               
               
                  Ofcertaine actes of diſobedience which the S. chaſticed.
                  THE XL. CHAPTER.
                  THere was preſented vnto S. Frācis, a Brother that had diſobeyed his Superiour, to be corrected according to his deſartt: but the benigne holy Father, perceiuing by euident ſignes that the ſaid Brother was already penitent, &amp; with great humilitie acknoledged his faulte, he pardonned him: yet to the end his facilitie of pardonning ſhould not occaſion others to offend, he cauſed his capuce to be taken off, and caſt into the fire, that it might appeare to all, with what rigour

diſobedience ought to be chaſticed: where hauing remayned a certaine time entier, he cauſed it to be reſtored to the brother that very humblie demaunded it, and the ſaid capuce was ſeene, not without a generall admiration, without any apparence of burning. It pleaſed almightie God in one act to ſhew two thinges pleaſing to his diuine Maieſtie, the vertue of the holie Father, and the meritt of true penitence.
                  It happened an other time, that the S. Hauing commanded a brother to haue care of a leaper, and to ſerue him with dilligence and affection, the brother would not attempt the matter: And being afterward demaunded by the holy Father if he had employed himſelfe therin, and he vnderſtanding the contrary: I thought, ſaid he vnto him, I had vnder my gouernment men dead to the world: but they are yet liuing: Goe therfore you others, ſaid he, to the Brethren, there preſent,Rigourus chaſticement of a diſobedient. take this diſobedient and bury him aliue. The Brethren attempted the performance of their duety, ſome of them digged the graue, and others others brought thither the diſobedient, who entred into it with a great indignation of ſpiritt and beſides his ſences; as one that by his diſobedience, was already in the diuels poſſeſsion. He alſo commanded the Brethren to couer him inſtantly with earth: but being ſcarce halfe couered, the deuill, by the merittes of the S. Hauing left him, he began bitterly to weep, ſaying: The deuill that had hardened my hard, hath now altogether left me: but proceed you bouldly in couering me, for I haue well deſerued this death and a more greiuous. The Brethren hearing him, began to weep with him, and ſome of them aduertiſed the S. of his conuerſion, who commanded that he ſhould be taken vp and brought before him, where being, he ſaid vnto him: Chooſe what houſe you will, wherin you may be comforted, and there ſhall you dwell vpon obedience: which the Brother hearinge, with bitter teares he anſweared: not ſo my moſt gracious Father if you pleaſe, but the greateſt conſolation you can giue me, is that I accompliſh my firſt penance: the holy Father being moued with theſe wordes, gaue him his benediction.
                  Thus hath he ſhewen vs by theſe examples that the end of the chaſticement of Religion, ought to be penitence and amendement of the ſinner, on whom, if he acknowledge himſelfe, chaſticement ought not to
                        Luc. 15. be inflicted, but fatherlie conſolation rather, as IESVS CHRIST hath taught vs in his worthy parabole of the prodigall child, who being repentant of his offences, demaunded pardon of his father, and the father very tenderlie embraced him, and with great ioy conducted him into his houſe.
               
               
                  
                  How S. Francis ſent Brother Ruffinus to preach without the caepuce in vertue of obedience, and of the penance which therſore he inflicted on himſelfe.
                  THE XLI. CHAPTER.
                  BY this that followeth there appeareth a merueillous order for gouernment: to witt, that the Superiour ought not to command vnto his ſubiects the thinge that himſelfe would not doe. S. Francis one day called vnto him Brother Ruffinus, whome he commanded to goe preach in the cittie of Aſsiſium, and to deliuer vnto the people onlie what God ſhould inſpire vnto him: but Brother Ruffinus making his excuſe, anſweared: Pardon me if you pleaſe, good Father, you know I am not apt to preach, becauſe I haue not any grace in my ſpeech as being too ſimple and an idiot. Which he ſpake with much humilitie. And though in deed he had bin a diſcreet knight in the world, he was, neuertheles ſo chaunged in himſelfe by meanes of the grace of contemplation which he had receiued of God; that he was manie times out of himſelfe, and ſpake verie ſeldome, and yet that litle was with ſuch difficulty, that he ſeemed to ſpeake with exceedinge paine: but the S. reprehending him for not hauing inſtantlie obeyed, commanded him further vpon obedience, and gaue him for penance, to goe without his capuce.
                  The obedient Brother Ruffinus then, without farther contradiction, hauing put off his capuce, and falling one the ground demaunded his benediction, which hauing receiued, he went to Aſsiſium, and firſt entred into a church, there to make his prayer: which done, he aſcended the pulpitt, and began to preach. The people then aſſembled, who admiring to ſee him without capuce, and amazed att ſuch a noueltie, ſaid one to an other: theſe poore Freers doe ſuch auſtere penance, that there withall they looſe their witts. So whiles this good Brother preached, S. Francis conſidering the prompt obedience of Brother Ruffinus, and the rigour of his commandement, he began to check himſelfe, thus reaſoning the matter: What will haſt thou gotten, thou ſonne of Peter Bernardone, thou of ſo meane eſtate, to command Brother Ruffinus, who is one of the principall gentlemen of Aſsiſium, to goe preach without his capuce? I will make thee to be an example of what thou haſt commanded to an other: and ſpeaking thus to himſelfe, he haſtiely tooke the capuce from his owne head, and taking Brother Leo for companion, he went to Aſsiſium. Being come into the church where Brother Ruffinus preached, the people that ſaw him without capuce, eſteemed him to be likewiſe fooliſh, beleeuing

that the Br. Ruffinus and he were become ſottiſh, by meanes of their ouer ſharpe penance: many people therfore flocking thither, Brother Ruffinus in the beſt manner he could deliuered this ſpeech.
                  My beloued Brethren, ſhunne the world, leaue ſinne, retourne to theSubſtantiall ſermon of B. Ruffinus in notable ſpeeches. ſocure way, if you deſire to avoid hell, obſerue the diuine preceptes, loue God and your neighbour and doe penance, becauſe the great king
                        •
                      dome of heauen approacheth, att leaſt if you will poſſeſſe it. But as ſoone as he perceiued S. Francis he diſcended from the pulpitt, to come vnto him: and the S. incontinentlie aſcended. The Church was then entierlie full of wordlie people: for ſome came thither to ſee the extremitie of that life, others moued with compaſsion and deuotion, and others to deride them reputing them ſenceles: but the holie Ghoſt that was in S. Francis, cauſed him to vtter ſuch worthy and merueillous matters, of the contempt of the world, of holie and neceſſary penance, and of voluntary pouerty, of the deſire of the kingdome of heauen, of obedience, of the nuditie, ignominies, and paſsion of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and other like thinges, which he declared in ſuch manner, and with ſuch feruour, that they who formerlie derided the noueltie of his habitt, and reputed theſe Brethren to be out of their right ſences, did now bitterly weepe, and ſuch was that weeping, and ſo violent for the compaſsion which they had of the death of IESVS CHRIST crucified, and the feare which they conceaued of hell, that they began to crie for mercie, as if it had bin an other good friday (on which day the Paſsion is preached ſo patheticallie in Italy, that all the world cryeth mercie, as one would doe att the ſacking of a towne.) Wherfore the people being ſo edified and contrite, Brother Leo, who had brought with him both the capuces, gaue to each one his owne: &amp; they afterward retourned to their Monaſterie, prayſing God for his great mercie, ſith by the vertue of holie obedience, they had obtayned victorie ouer themſelues, and manifeſted how much they contemned the world. They had much to doe to be ridd of the people, that before reputed them for fooles: and now he that could touch or kiſſe their habittes eſteemed himſelfe happy. It appeared by the end of this worck, that the beginning proceeded of God, though it were wrought by an exceſsiue meane as the worcke of the Prophettes, not ſo much to be imitated, as for a ſigne of approbation of holy obedience, of mortification of ſelfe will, and contempt of the world: and that we might know what glorious end God giueth to the worckes of holy obedience, either ſecrett or manifeſt, as it pleaſeth him.
               
               
                  
                  Of the loue which S. Francis boare to pouerty.
                  THE XLII. CHAPTER.
                  AMong many giftes and ſinguler fauours which the glorious S. receaued att the bountifull hand of God, one of the principall was that of pouerty, wherby he became a new man in the world, terrible to the deuil, and an example to all mortall people, by the loue and poſſeſsion wherof, he merited by diuine and ſpeciall priuiledge to haue principallitie in the holie Church. The ſaid S. had this particuler affection to holie pouertie, by conſideration how much it was eſteemed of the Sonne of God, whiles he conuerſed here below, and how it was then baniſhed and expelled out of all the world. He therfore deſiring with himſelfe to make his reſidence where holy pouerty was retired, renounced the world, and what ſoeuer he had proper, he gaue to the poore: and hauing for the loue of God forſaken his Father, his mother, his kinred and freindes, he remayned a perfect pilgrime on earth, to meritt to lodge in himſelfe holy pouertie ſo generallie abhorred. There was neuer auaricious of the world ſo greedy of monie and ſo carefull to keepe his treaſure, as Saint Francis was to keepe his pouertie, which he alwayes had in his eyes, and in his mouth, as a precious
                        Mat. 13. ſtone and Euangelicall pearle: he dwelt with pouertie, he eat with it, he cloathed himſelfe with it, he dreamed of it, breefly he had it alwayes imprinted in his hart, vſing onlie for this life a ſhort coat, ſtreight, and all peiced, a cord and linnen breeches: contenting himſelfe neuertheles in this his rich pouertie, he therin perſeuered euen to the end, deſiring in the ſame to exceed euery one, as he had learned of it, to eſteeme himſelfe the leaſt of all. He often repreſented vnto himſelfe the pouertie of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and of his moſt ſacred mother, and practicallie taught it vnto his diſciples with great abondance of teares, aſſuring them that pouertie was the Queene of vertues, in regard that it appeared of ſuch excellent beautie in the king of heauen, and in the Queene his mother. Pouertie, ſaid he, is a principall way vnto ſaluation, as being mother and nourſe of humilitye, and the root of all perfection, whoſe fruit is of exceeding profitt and furtherance to euery one, albeit this verity be very ſecrett and vnknowne to the men of the world, it is without doubt the hidden treaſure, in the Euangelicall feild, the
                        Mat. 13. which to buy, a man ought to ſell all that he hath: and he that cannot giue his goodes to the poore, ought att leaſt to haue a will to contemne richeſſe, and to vſe violence vnto his proper will and preſumption:

for he doth not perfectly renounce the world, that keepeth his purſe full of his proper iudgement and wil.
                  Thus diſcourſing of holy pouerty, he often reiterated the wordes of
                        Luc. 9. God: The foxes haue holes, and the foules of the aire neſtes: but the Sonne of man hath not where to repoſe his head. Then he exhorted his diſciples, that as poore people they ſhould build but poore cottages for their reſidence, where they ſhould remaine, not as in theire owneThe lawes of Pilgrimes imitated by the Freer Minors. Pouerty the foundation of the Order of S. Francis. Mat. 19.
                      houſes, but as pilgrimes, and ſtraungers that aime att other places. The law of Pilgrimes, ſaid he, and their reaſonnable deſire, is to retire into the houſes of others during their voyage, conceating neuer to ſee the hower to arriue in their country, by reaſon of the great deſire they haue to be there, and to paſſe peaceably without medling in matters appertaynning to others. He called pouerty the foundation of his Order, whervpon all his edifice was grounded. Therfore he affirmed vnto thē that he knew by reuelation, that the true entry of his Religion was this word of IESVS CHRIST: If thou wilt be perfect, goe, ſell the thinges that thou haſt, and giue to the poore, and thou ſhalt haue treaſure in heauen: and come, follow me: In reſpect wherof he admitted noneinto his Order, if within the tearme of the yeare of probation they did not forſake what ſoeuer they poſſeſſed in the world. This he cauſed to be very exactly obſerued aſwell in regard of the ſaid wordes of IESVS CHRIST: as alſo that none ſhould ſearch in theHis exactnes for renouncing of the world. treaſuries of Religion for any thing that he had putt there. And if any one demaunded the habitt of Religion not hauing made the ſaid renunciation, he would ſay vnto him: Get thee hence: for thou art not yet gone forth of thy houſe, thou haſt not forſaken that which appertayneth vnto thee, nor abandonned the feeble foundation, grounded on the ſand of affection vnto worldly goodes, and yet demaundeſt of me the habitt, firſt accompliſh what thou oughteſt, and then demaund it. By the ſaid foundation he vnderſtood holy pouerty, whome he ſometime accuſtomed to call mother, att other times eſpouſe, and ſometime Miſtreſſe.
                  Goeing one day with ſome of his Brethren towardes Sienna, being verie neere the citty, he mett three women, ſo like in geſture, beauty and habitte that the one could not be diſcerned from the other, and all three with one voice ſaluted him ſaying: Holy Pouerty is welcome: which the S. hearing, exceedingly reioyced: as one that affected nothing more then to be called pouerty of each one, as he was then of the ſaid women, who incontinently diſappeared: which being ſeene and conſidered by the other Brethren his companions, filled with admiration att ſuch and ſo vnwonted accident, they eſteemed the ſame not to want ſome great miſtery: and it doubtles was

eaſy to coniecture, that the ſaid three women (or perhaps Angels) did ſignifie the beautie and Euangelicall perfection of the three principall vowes, Pouertie, Obedience, and Chaſtitie, which IESVS CHRIST counſailed to the Brethren, all which did appeare to be equall in the S. in all eminence and perfection.
               
               
                  That he did extremely abhorre mony.
                  THE XLIII. CHAPTER.
                  THough he were directly oppoſite to what ſoeuer repugned pouertie, he moſt eſpecially hated mony, and by examples and wordes did often reiterat vnto his brethren that they ſhould ſhunne it as the deuill. It chaunced that a ſeculer man hauing done his deuotions in the Church of our lady of Angels where the brethren dwelt, left a peice of mony in ſigne of almoſe, neere a litle Croſſe; which a Brother tooke and hid in a hoale of the ſaid Church to giue toPennāce which S. Francis enioyned a Religious for hauing touched monie. the poore. But in the meane while S. Francis had intelligence therof, and the ſaid Brother cōſidered the matter and went and fell at the feete of the S. of whome he demaunded pardon, and offered himſelfe to pennance. The holy Father hauing well checked him for preſuming to touch mony, commaunded him to take the peice of mony where it was, in his mouth and to caſt it into the houſe of office: which the Brother hauing ioyfully and inſtantly performed, his companions did all admire, and thence forward more contemned mony.
                  The S. paſsing an other time by Bary in Apulia, ſaw a great purſe in the middes of the way which ſeemed to be full of mony: the BrotherAn illuſion of the deuill to a Freer Minor to teach him not to touch monie. that accompanied him did exceedinglie importune him to take vp the purſe being therto induced by a pious zeale to diſtribute the mony which he beleeued to be therin, vnto the poore. But the holie Father refuſing, affirmed, that it was an illuſion of the deuill, and that he had no leſſe deſire to releiue the poore, then the Brother: and further that it was not well done to take an others goodes and to giue it to the poore: and ſo went on his way. But his companion being yet tempted of the deuill, and perſiſting to importune him vnder pretence of an indiſcreet zeale to releiue the poore: he was att length enforced to permitt him to take vp the ſaid purſe, ſo to lett him vnderſtand the illuſion: being therfore retourned in the companie of a yong man whome they mett in the way, the holie Father made his prayer, and then bid his companion

                     A viper commeth out of a purſethat a Frier Minor would take vp to giue in almoſe. to take vp the purſe: who being licenced, began to tremble with feare▪ already feeling the deceipt of the deuill. Yet ſtooping to take vp the purſe, now rather of obedience then of any will he had, being already repentant, and ſtrecthing out his hand to take hold therof, he ſaw goe out of it a great viper, and in the ſame inſtant all vaniſhed, and ſo the deceipt of the deuill was diſcouered. The ſaid Brother therfore acknowledging his vaine curioſitie and confeſsing his fault to S. Francis, he ſaid vnto him: Behold Brother, mony to a Religious man is no other thing, but the deuill and venimous ſerpentes.
               
               
                  That he deſired that pouerty should shine in all his, and his Brethrens actions.
                  THE XLIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe true poore of IESVS CHRIST ſought &amp; deſired that holy pouerty ſhould appeare in all his actions: and if ſometimes he perceaued any one that exteriourly in his habitt ſeemed poorer them himſelfe, he deſired to exceed him, and ſo practiſed herein with ſuch deſire to appeare miſerable among the poore, that for feare to be ſurmounted in pouerty, he firmelie contended withall the world. Meeting a poore man one daye on the way almoſt all naked, he ſaid with a lamenting voice vnto his companion: The pouerty of this miſerable man procureth vs great ſhame: for we haue made choice of pouertie to be our great richeſſe: &amp; I ſee it appeare greater in this man, &amp; this ſhame is to vs more inſupportable, in that it is now ſaid ouer al the world, that Brother Francis and his companions haue choſen holy pouertie for companion, Lady, Miſtreſſe, and their delightes as well ſpirituall as corporall, &amp; that they haue ſo promiſed to God &amp; men. By theſe wordes the holy Father deſired that the Brethren ſhould make it their eſteeme to be poore, and ſhould be aſhamed to doe or weare any thing wherin ſhould not appeare the incōmoditie therof: ſo that he would not haue the beanes or peaſe watered ouer night for the next morning, deſiring
                        Matt. 6. to obſerue the ſaying of IESVS CHRIST in the Goſpell: Be not carefull for the morrow: and he would not that prouiſion ſhould be made of their food but from day to day: which was long time inuiolably obſerued in many places of the Religion.
                  
                     A notable ſpeech to his Brethren. The true poore of IESVS CHRIST ſaid that how much his Brethren ſhould ſhunne pouertie, ſo much would the world ſhunne them, &amp; that they ſhould ſeeke almoſe and not finde it: but if they embraced holie pouertie, as their deere mother, the world would ſuſtaine &amp; nouriſh thē, and acknowledge them as ſent for the ſaluation therof: for the accord

betweene it and the Freer Minors, is that they ſhall giue it good example, and that it ſhall allow them neceſſarie releife: and if they giue notCōtracts paſsed betweene the world and the Frier Minors. it good example, performing that wherto they are obliged, the world hath iuſt reaſon to depriue them of their ordinarie almoſe. The Biſhop of Aſsiſium ſaid one day to S. Francis, that this his manner of life ſeemed to him very auſtere and difficult, conſidering that he had nothing aſſured for his maintenance: the holy Father anſweared him: My Lord, if we had any ſubſtance, it were neceſſary we had alſo weapons to defend it, for of it would proceed difficulties, debates, matters of ſelfe loue, and many other impedimentes againſt obtayning the loue of God, and particulerlie of our neighbour. Therfore we hold it moſt ſecure not to ſeeke the poſſeſsion of whatſoeuer thing in the world: and we hope that in reſpect therof, our Lord will permitt vs to be loued and cheriſhed of euerie one.
               
               
                  Of the exerciſe of pouerty, which is to demaund almoſe: and what S. Francis and his diſciples did touching this point.
                  THE XLV. CHAPTER.
                  WHen the holy Father began to haue encreaſe of Brethren, conſidering that God had giuen him ſo holy a company and ſo ſweet a conuerſation, he was exceedingly comforted, and ſo loued and honoured his children of IESVS CHRIST, that their neceſſary food failing, he ſent not them to the dores to ſeeke almoſe, but went himſelfe, which he did as wel that they ſhould not be troubled att any thing that might happen, or fearing they might be aſhamed to begge, becauſe it was then an vnuſuall thinge, as alſo that the world ſhould not giue them occaſion to repent and retourne back, againſt their holy vocation. He cōtinued this courſe till the holie winges of the loue of God and ſo holy pouerty were growne out, wherwith they were able to fly abroad and trauaile ouer the world, to become glorious in the labours of pouerty, the better to ſow the ſeed of the word of God among the people. And although it were very labourſome vnto him ſo much to begge, yet was it more painfull vnto him byS. Francis him ſelfe begged att the beginning of his Order. reaſon of his complexion, becauſe being of a delicate nature, his abſtinence and auſterity was an impediment vnto him of ſupporting this burden. Therfore the nomber of his Brethren being exceedingly multiplyed, he began to ſeet one foot this vertuous exerciſe of begging. And albeit they were att firſt aſhamed, and that it ſeemed very hard and difficult vnto them: yet aſsiſted by remembrance of the holy obedience which they had vowed, they found both this and euery other thing very

eaſy and pleaſant. And then ſeeing the holie Father ſo to paine himſelfe for them, they prayed him to leaue that labour vnto them. Wherto he anſweared: My beloued Brethren you ſhould not eſteeme it a difficultie to goe ſeeke almoſe from dore to dore for the loue of God, but to account it a great fauour of his. For who is he that would not more then willinglie goe to demaund almoſe, if he ſaw his Prince and Lord to goe before him, ſaying with himſelfe: What ſhall the diſciple be more worthy then the maſter, and the ſeruaunt then the Lord? ſhould it not be rather pride then ſhame? would not ſuch one deſerue rather puniſhment then compaſsion? Remember that our Lord IESVS CHRISTPraiſe of begging. that celeſtiall king, of whoſe mites or crummes (to witt of the bread of grace) the Angels of heauen and the inhabitantes of the earth are maintayned: He, I ſay, that became poore for our benefitt and example,Exhortation of S. Fr. to his diſciples ſending thē to begge. Pſal. 39.
                      asked almoſe, and liued by it in this world. We can neuer walke ſo ſtrict a way of pouertie, if we haue not firſt our Lord before our eyes as a begger whiles he liued in this world, and in like ſort all his diſciples. Therfore he ſaid by his Prophett Dauid: I am a begger and poore, God hath bin careful of me. Goe on then ſecurely after ſo worthy a Capitaine &amp; guide, to take poſſeſsion of that inheritance which IESVS CHRIST hath pourchaced vs, and hath left to them that according to his example leaue the world, and ſeeke to liue in pouertie, onlie for his loue: glorie of this inheritance and preferment, in regard that he hath giuen it only to his beloued. Know that many of the moſt noble and beſt learned men of the world ſhall adhere to our company, who ſhall repute it a great fauour in this manner to goe aske an almoſe. Goe then ſeeke for almoſe with the benediction of God, and haue a faith and aſſurance farThat the Freers richly pay their benefactours. greater then they who carry with them a quantitie of ſiluer to pay it att the will of their maſter, for you pay your benefactours more liberally then any other, though it ſeeme not ſo, giuing them for your almoſe, the loue of God, when you ſay: Giue vs an almoſe for the loue of God. But tell me, I pray you, what thing may there be had in heauen or earth, that can equalize the price of the loue of God? The Brethren being by their gracious Father thus induced, went with allacrity to demaund almoſe into the townes and other places: and being▪retourned to their Couent, they incontinentlie deliuered it to the Father Gardian, who afterward diſtributed it in common. The ſaid holy Father being one time in the Church of our lady of Angels, a Brother that was very ſpirituall retourned from beging from Aſsiſium, with a loud voice thancking God: S. Francis perceauing him, was ſtricken with an amourous affection towardes him, and went himſelfe vnto him, and kiſſed his ſhoulder wheron he caryed the wallett, which he tooke off, and layed on his owne ſhoulder to carry to the Couent,

where he ſaid to the other Brethren: I will that my fellowHow he deſired they should goe S. Fr. expelled a Religious out of the Order becauſe he refuſed to begge. Brethren doe in like ſort ſeeke almoſe, and prayſe God att their retourne.
                  It happened one day that a Nouice was commaunded to goe to begge, but he refuſed to goe, alleadging that he ſhould be aſhamed. The holy Father vnderſtanding it, expelled him out of the Order with theſe wordes: What? Brother flye, wilt thou liue of the labour of the other Brethren, and reſt idle in the vineyard of God, as the drone, who without trauaile ſeeketh to eat the labour of the bees? The will of S. Francis was, that the Brethren ſhould often goe a begging according to their neceſsity, that they might meritt; and that being accuſtomed therto, they ſhould not be aſhamed when occaſion vrged them to goe. And ſo the more noble and the more honoured a Brother had bin in the world, the more ioyfull and content was he and the better edified, aſwell by this humility as by other ſeruices of obedience which he performed. Sometimes S. Francis encouraging his Brethren, would vſeWhy the Freer Minors are in the world. Mat. 25.
                      theſe like wordes vnto them: My Brethren, we haue bin giuen vnto the world in this latter, age that the elect might accompliſh in vs the worckes of charitie, to the end they might meritt to be recompenced att the laſt day of iudgment, with theſe ſweet wordes of our God: I was an hungred, and you gaue me to eat: I was thirſty, and you gaue me to drincke, and as long as you did it to one of theſe my leaſt Brethren, you did it to me. Therupon the S. affirmed that to begge vnder the title of Freer Minor, was a thing of exceeding conſolation and recompence in the retribution of the iuſt; which forenamed title the maſter of the Euangelicall truth, particulerly ſpecified with his diuine mouth, when he ſaid by his Prophett: Man hath eaten the bread of
                        Pſal. 77. Angels: for this bread which is demaunded for the loue of God, ſaid the S. is properlie called the bread of Angels, ſith his diuine MaieſtieOn ſolemne feaſtes S. Francis liued only with what he begged: Luc. 24.

Being one time of Eaſter in a Couent, ſo far from habitation that there was no meane for him to begge, calling to minde that our Lord IESVS CHRIST, on the like day appeared in forme of a Pilgrime to his diſciples that went to Emaus, he demanded almoſe in the refectorie of his owne Brethren, as a poore ſtraunger, and liued therwith admoniſhing his Brethren, that paſsing through the deſert of this world as Pilgrimes and ſtraungers, and as true Hebrewes that haue no aſſured reſidence here, they ſhould alwayes in humilitie of ſpiritt celebrate the Paſch of God, which is his paſſadge from this world to his eternall Father in the glory of heauen.
               
               
                  
                  Being inuited by certaine great noble men, to eat with them, be 
                        •
                     at nothing there but the almoſe which he had begged att the dores.
                  THE XLVI. CHAPTER.
                  BY reaſon that he demaunded not almoſe out of a couetouſnes, but only by a liberty of ſpiritt and a zeale of holy pouerty, for the loue of IESVS CHRIST, therfore did he far more willingly eate of that which he begged and was giuen him att dores, then of what was preſented him att table in the banquettes of Princes. When therfore he was inuited by them, before he went thither, he firſt begged morcels of bread att the dores, which he eat att their tables. Which he did, partlie for loue he bare to holie pouerty, and partly alſo to giue exampleBeing inuited to eat with a Cardinall he brought what he had begged and why. to his Brethren. Being one day inuited by the Cardinall of Hoſtia, who exceedinglie loued him, he firſt according to his cuſtome begged peices of bread, and hauing gott what was neceſſary, he went to the table of the ſaid Cardinall, where he ſodenlie emptyed out all the ſaid peices of bread, and laid before him, next vnto whome was the place, of the ſaid Cardinall, who eſteemed himſelfe as it were braued thereby: yet for the preſent would ſay nothing therof. But the holy Father, thincking on what he had to doe, began to deuide his bread into many litle morcels, which he diſtributed among the noble men that were att the table, who receaued it very deuoutly, ſome of them preſentlie eating it, others kept it for reuerence. Which the Cardinall perceauing with much contentment, was ſomewhat appeaſed. Notwithſtanding after the refection being retired into a chamber with S. Francis, embracing him and clipping him with his armes, he geſtingly ſaid: O ſimple brother my freind, why haſt thou giuen me ſo great an affront this daye, as comming to eat att my table, which is thine and theirs who appertaine vnto thee, thou wouldeſt firſt begge that thou wert to eat? The holy Father anſweared him: nay I haue rather done you this day great honour, ſith that att your table hath bin honoured a greater Lord then your ſelfe, and one that is your maſter: beſides the ſubiect doeing that which his Lord commandeth him, he honoureth his maſter. For God had ſo much loued this royall pouerty, that he hath vouch-ſafed to accept her for his eſpouſe, to enrich vs her inheritours together with her, and by meanes of pouerty of ſpiritt which we ſhall haue here, to giue vs glory afterwardes in heauen.
                  NOW I neither can nor will omitt to gaine ſuch a ſucceſsion, for any apparance of falſe richeſſe that may be preſented: conſidering with all that they are of ſmall continuance: and ſo much more in regard that it is

neceſſary for me to make my ſelfe a forme and example vnto my other Brethren: and beſides for that I well know that in this Religion, there are and ſhalbe many Brethren that ſhalbe minors in name and effect for the loue of God and by the light of the holy Ghoſt that teacheth them, with all humility to ſerue others in their neceſsity. I know likewiſe very well, would to God it were not ſo, that there are and yet ſhalbe more, ſuch as ſhall haue no will to humble themſelues to aſke almoſe and to doe other ſeruile offices, be it either thorough ſhame or by corrupted manners. It is therfore neceſſary for me to inſtruct them their duety by worckes, to the end that both in this world &amp; the other they be inexcuſable before God: and that they may not ſay, they found none that gaue them example, and ſo they remaine diſchardged. Being therfore att this preſent with you, who are an Apoſtolicall Prince, and our Protectour, or att other times with ſome other great perſonnes, that entertaine me not only with a pleaſing countenance, for the loue of IESVS CHRIST; but euen doe ſometimes conſtraine me to remaine with you: I ſhould not therfore be aſhamed to aſke almoſe, but I rather am ioyfull to receaue it and to follow my God: eſteeming it for his loue to be an heroicall act and of dignitye: for himſelfe being almighty, would for vs become and make himſelfe as nothing.
                        Phil. 2. Now I would haue all my Brethren preſent and to come to know, that I am better pleaſed to be att their table, and to ſee their pouerty, then to be att theſe your bountifull tables that are ſuperfluous in all thinges: becauſe the bread receaued of almoſe, is bread offered and entierly ſacrificed for the loue of God, ſith the Brother that demaundeth it, ſaith firſt, God be prayſed, and then aſketh it, in the name and for the loue of God. This ſaid, S. Francis was ſilent, and the Cardinall was exceedingly edified by the ſeruour of his wordes, which did ſpiritualy comfort him.
               
               
                  Of the ſecond exerciſe of pouerty, which conſiſteth in giuing: and how S. Francis denyed nothing to the poore.
                  THE XLVII. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father had beſides, a moſt exceeding naturall clemencie and liberalitie, which redoubled the giftes he had of holy pouerty, and the compaſsion that God had imparted vnto him, which was the cauſe why he did not only glory in demaunding, but much more in denying nothing for the loue of God. He declared by effect that it is a more happy thing, to giue for the loue of God, then to aſke of them that are truely poore of ſpiritt, who poſſeſſe nothing

in proper, but as from IESVS CHRIST and their neighbour: And becauſe the profeſſors of Euangelicall pouerty beginne by this action of giuing all they haue to the poore of IESVS CHRIST, and therby obtaine the eſtate and title of poore of ſpiritt, they exerciſe, perſeuer and conſummate themſelues therin, denying nothing that is in their power, yea giuing themſelues, for the ſeruice of their neighbour, becauſe they who are ſuch, are very ready and content to giue, hauing alwayes in memory the wordes of IESVS CHRIST,
                        Luc. 6. which he left as a law vnto his diſciples, to witt: Giue, and it ſhalb
                        •
                      giuen you: which wordes are ſo negligently obſerued of Chriſtians, that they may be iuſtly called in humane (be they of what eſtate and condition they pleaſe) ſith they acknoledge no neceſsity in others, becauſe they feele it not in themſelues. And therfore the poore of ſpiritt, whoſoeuer they be doe obſerue this law: for if they acknoledge themſelues in neceſsity and deſire to be aſsiſted, they muſt aſsiſt euery one towardes his ſalutaion. The ſaid holie Father then inſtituting the true religion of pouertie, endeauoured to teach that the true nature of holie pouerty, did not ſo much conſiſt in aſking, as in giuing any thing that one hath or poſſeſſeth, if it be demaunded in the name of God: and this to the end that auarice or cruelty enter not into the houſe of holy pouertie and of Chriſtian piety. He alſo taught them in all poore to conſider IESVS CHRIST: and therfore, meeting any poore on the way, were he neuer ſo miſerable, he did not onlie giue him (as to the perſon of IESVS CHRIST) what he had, though it were neceſſary to the entertainment of his owne life: but he euen eſteemed it of right to be rendred as appertaining to the poore party: wherof I will deduce and relate ſome few examples, of a great multitude which might be committed to writing of this holy Father.
                  In a verie extreame cold of the winter, a brother of one of the Religious lent him a peice of cloth to vſe for a cloake: but meeting aS. Franc. gaue his cloake &amp; his companions alſo in the winter to a poore woman to cloath her. poore old woman, that aſked him an almoſe, he preſentlie putt off the ſaid cloake from his ſhoulders, and, albeit it were not his owne, gaue it vnto her ſaying: Hold, ſiſter, make thee a coat of this cloath, in regard that thou haſt need therof. She went very contentedlie and ioyfull to her houſe, and hauing cutt out a coat of that cloath, ſhe wanted yet a litle peice to finiſh the ſame: in which caſe not knowing what to doe, ſhe att length conſidered the liberalitie of the ſaid S. whome ſhe ſought out ſhewing vnto him the coat cutt out and what ſhe wanted. The holie Father ſeeing the neceſsitie of this poore old woman, tourning to his companion, Brother, ſaid he, behold the neceſsity of this poore woman: lett vs for the

loue of God endure the cold, giue her thy cloake, to ſupply her want of cloath, which the Brother incontinentlie performed: ſo that by cloathing her alone, they both remayned in ſo cold a ſeaſon without cloake.
                  The S. being an other time in the Couent of Cortona, he had a new cloake, which the Brethren had made him: but ſeeing a poore manWhich he performed diuers times. that lamented his deceaſed wife and deſolate family; he endeauoured to comfort him: but the afflicted anſweared, that the occaſions of his teares were great and diuers; but that which moſt afflicted him was, the great chardge of his diſtreſſed familie that remayned deſolate and forlorne, by the death of his wife. The S. moued with compaſsion, gaue him his cloake with theſe wordes: I giue thee this for the loue of God: yet with this condition, that if it be required of thee, thou deliuer it not except thou be payed for it. Now the Brethren that had very latelie before giuen him this cloake, went whence he came, and would haue taken the cloake from the poore man: but he being emboldened vpon the wordes of the S. would not reſtore it, nor could they euer recouer it by other meanes, but by praying one to redeeme it.
                  Retourning from Sienna, he found a poore man by the way and tourning to his companion he ſaid, it is neceſſary that I giue my cloake to this poore man, becauſe it is his: for it is lent me of God, with chardge to reſtore it to the firſt that I mett poorer then my ſelfe; and this man is much poorer, wherfore if I doe otherwiſe I ſhalbe a theefe: and therwith he gaue it vnto him: not withſtanding the conſiderations that his companion alleadged, wherby he endeauoured to perſuade him, that he was bound to ſatisfie his owne neceſsities before an others.
                  Comming neere to Peruſia, he mett a poore man whome he had formerlie knowne in the world, whome hauing ſaluted and aſked how he fared, the poore man with greife, anſweared,Likewiſe for the hire which a maſter detained from his ſeruant that curſed him. ill: then began to curſe his maſter, that withheld his hire, affirming it to be the cauſe of his diſpaire. The ſaint exhorting him to pardon it, leaſt he ſhould with all looſe his ſoule, he replyed that whiles his dew was retayned, he could not pardon him: The holie Father then putt of his cloake and gaue it him ſaying: Hold brotther, and freind, I giue thee my cloake, for the hire which they maſter oweth thee, and I require onlie of thee that thou pardon him for the loue of God, and by this worthy act he ſo mollified the hardnes of this ſeruants hart, that he pardoned his maſter.
                  
                     
The Phiſitian of Rieta, that medecined his eyes, one day as he was dreſsing him, recounted vnto him, that he in like ſort dreſſed and medecined a poore woman of the ſame diſeaſe, to whome, beſides the ſeruice he did vnto her, he was conſtrained, out of compaſsion he conceaued of her miſerie to giue her releife. Which the S. vnderſtanding, and moued with pitty towardes this woman, not ſo much for her diſeaſe, as for her pouerty, he inſtantlie called the Guardian, to whome he ſayd: Brother we muſt reſtore that which we haue appertayning to an other: The Guardian admiring, anſweared: Father what haue we belonging to others? S. Francis replied, this cloake whome we hold as borrowed of a poore woman, to whome it is now requiſite to reſtore the ſame. Wherto the Guardian anſweared: Doe as you pleaſe. The S. then called a very Religious ſeculer man, and ſaid: Take this cloake, and twelue loaues that ſhalbe giuen thee, and goe to ſuch a poore ſick woman, and tell her that the poore man to whome ſhe Lent the ſame ſendeth it againe vnto her with thanckes, and leaue it all with her, and then retourne. This good man did as the holy Father had enioyned him, but the poore woman thincking that he had ieſted with her, anſweared him: Freind I lent not this cloake to any man: ſo that I vnderſtand not what you meane: but the man left the cloake and the bread, without other replie then, it is yours, make vſe therof: which the poore woman with thanckes to God, accepted.
               
               
                  Of other like charities performed by the Saint for the loue of God.
                  THE XLVIII. CHAPTER.
                  GOeing one day to preach, he mett two of his Religious, thatHe gaue his habit that was demaunded him for the loue of God. were French, with whome he a while diſcourſed. Theſe Fathers being exceedinglie conforted both by his life, and conference, according to what they had heard of him, did out of deuotion demaunde his owne habitt which he did weare, and that, for the loue of God: whoſe name he hearing, did inſtantlie diſcloath himſelfe, and gaue it vnto them, putting on an other which one of them did att that preſent putt off: which he performed in obſeruance of his vow, which was incontinentlie to giue what ſoeuer ſhould be demaunded him for the loue of God, for reuerence to this Lord, whoſe will was to be termed, Loue: and therfore he was much offended and ſharply reprehended the Religious when vpon any light occaſion, and withoutNote that the loue of God ought neuer to be vttered with out reuerence. edification of their neighbour, they named the loue of God, which ſhould not be named but to ſome good purpoſe, and that with great reuerence. The S. ſeldome or neuer weare a new habitt: for when he

had ſuch one made, he would incontinently chaunge it with ſome other Religious for a torne one, and ſometimes he would take a litle part of ſome ragged and worne habitt, and as much of an other, and ſo patching it together, you may imagine what manner of habitt it could be. But he no farther regarded then to couer his ſtomack that was infirme.
                  There came a poore man one day where he was, that aſked a peece of cloath of a Religious for the loue of God, to patch his garment. Which the S. vnderſtanding, he cauſed euery corner of the houſe to be ſearched, and being anſweared that none could be found, he retired into a corner, not to be ſeene, and ripped of that which couered his ſtomack, and gaue it the poore man. But not doeing it ſo dexterously, but that he was perceaued by the Religious, they cauſed him to reſtore it. But the holy Father would neither take it not permitt the poore man to depart, till there was an other peece of cloath giuen him.
                  Being in the Couent of our lady of Angels, a poore woman that had two children in his Order, came to demaund an almoſe, and he called Brother Catanius, to whome he ſaid haue we nothing to giue to this our poore mother? whereto the ſaid brother Peter anſweared: That there was nothing fitt for her, if not a new teſtament, wherin they read the leſſons att matines which might be giuen her if he thought good, conſidering that ſhe aſked almoſe and was in extreme neceſsity.S. Franc. gaue the new testament which they vſed att Matines (hauing nothing els) to a poor woman. The holy Father pawſed not long theron, but ſodenly ſaid: I pray you giue it her, for ſhe may ſell it, and reliue her ſelfe in this her miſery: and I verily beleeue that this charity wilbe more pleaſing to God then our leſſons: and ſo it was deliuered her. Few bookes were then printed, in reſpect wherof they were deere. I haue alleadged this example to ſhew that this holy Father ſpared nothing from the poore that aſked it for the loue of God. Yea to performe this office of piety, if he chaunced to meet any poore people loaden on the way, he would diſburden them, and for a while carry their burden, that in the meane time they might take breath. He would haue all his Religious to honour the poore, as much as him ſelfe as repreſenting the perſon of our Lord IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  How much the ſaid S. would haue the poore to be honoured.
                  THE XLIX. CHAPTER.
                  
                     How he punished a rash iudgemēt GOeing to preach thorough Italy, he mett on the way a poore ſick creature, afflicted with many infirmities, of whome he cō
                     ceaued a ſtrong compaſsion. Then ſpake of him to his companion, who anſweared, that it was very true that he ſeemed poore, exteriourly

but perhappes was interiourly more puffed vp with deſires then any of that country. The holy Father very bitterly reprehended him for this raſh iudgement, and then ſayd: If my company be gratefull vnto thee, thou ſhalt performe the pennaunce that I ſhall now enioyne thee. The Religious acknowledging his fault and ſubmitting himſelfe to doe his penaunce, S. Francis ſaid vnto him: Strip thy ſelfe naked and aske him pardon, and beſeech him to pray to God for thee, which was done.
                  He cauſed an other Religious to doe the like, for hauing only giuen a rigorous anſweare to a poore man that asked an almoſe. He manifeſted to his Brethren how they ought to behaue themſelues towardes the poore in theſe termes: When you ſhall ſee a poore creature, conſider that it is a mirour which our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, propoſeth vnto you of his pouerty, and of his bleſſed virgin mother, andWhat profit may be drawne out of the ſight of the poore &amp; diſeaſed. that he preſenteth it to your ſight: When you ſhall ſee a ſick perſon, know that it is a paterne of the infirmity which he tooke on him for our ſakes: &amp; if the pride and irreuerence of the riche diſpleaſe God, how much more will diſpleaſe him the rigorous wordes of Freer Minors to ſuch as make profeſsiō of pouerty? If in this our profeſsion, God permitt that we be honoured of great perſonnes, how intollerable will our pride appeare, if proudly puffed vp, we contemne ſuch as are as poore as our ſelues? Lett vs therfore beware that by iuſt permiſsion of God it happen not to our confuſion, that the rich make leſſe eſteeme of vs, yea that they ſuffer vs to die for want of releife.
               
               
                  Of the ſpiritt of feruour of S. Francis in his preachinges.
                  THE L. CHAPTER.
                  
                     1. Tim. 4. BEcauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, that piety is profitable and behoufull in euery thing; this vertue was ſo vnited to the hart of the holy Father, and ſo engrauen in his bowels, that it ſeemed to ſubiect him to all creatures: but eſpecially to the ſoules redeemed by the precious bloud of our Lord IESVS CHRIST: for if the ſaw them ſicke or dead in ſinne, he had ſuch a tender feeling of hart and affection with them, as if he had naturally begotten them. And in that reſpect he excceedingly honoured Preachers, becauſe they alwayes rayſed ſome dead Brother vnto our Redeemer, and with a pious care endeauoured to reuoke the erring, and to confirme the imperfect in God. S. Francis then preached being veſted with this zeale and charity towardes his neighbour, not with ſelected wordes or by humane art, but by the vertue and doctrine of the holy Ghoſt, did manifeſt vnto them the kingdome of God: his preaching was vehement as a burning fire,

that peneteated the center of the hart, and putt ſoules into a continuall admiration, and as it were beſide themſelues. Prayer alone was all his bookes, diſtruſting all his knowledged and induſtrie, and entierly relying on the diuine vertue. He obtained of God this his holy grace which he ſo inſtantly required for aſsiſtance of his neighbour, in ſuch ſort that his wordes did penetrate not only the eares, but euen the hartes of ſinners.
                  It only once happened that he ſtudyed his ſermon, and the reaſon was becauſe he was to preach before the Pope and many Cardinals, by commandement of the Cardinall of Hoſtia Protectour of his Order.Hauing ſeriouſly studied a ſermon he could not recite it. And yet he other wiſe deliuered worthy matters. Mat. 10.
                      The time being come to aſcend the pulpitt, and being therin, he could by no meanes beginne his ſermon, though he exceedingly laboured to doe it: which infinitely troubled him, and much amazed the aſſiſtantes: wherfore he publickely acnowledged that he had ſeriously ſtudied that ſermon: but hauing incontinently recourſe to prayer, &amp; in few wordes recommending himſelfe with all his hart vnto God, vtterly reiecting his former conceipt, and entierly referring himſelfe to his diuine maieſtie; he began to preach with ſuch feruour, that hauing in an inſtant ſett att liberty his holy tongue, he deliuered matter ſo learned, ſublime and ſo neceſſary, that he moued all the hartes of his audience to compaſsion: and then it appeared to each one that the wordes of God were vndoubtedlie true, where he ſaith: It is not you that ſpeake but the ſpiritt (of God) that ſpeaketh in you. This holy Father thus obtayning the reuelatious of the diuine myſteries by meane of prayer, and correcting firſt whatſoeuer vices he found in himſelfe, it is not to be admired that he moued the moſt obdurat hartes vnto pennance, reprehending vices with ſuch vehemence. He preached with like feruour, his conſtancie being incredible, both to great and meaner people, riche and poore, many and few, and alwayes with exceeding profitt.
               
               
                  What conditions S. Francis required in Preachers.
                  THE LI. CHAPTER.
                  BEing, according to the example of IESVS CHRIST a true Euangelicall Preacher, and teaching rather by workes then wordes, he would in like ſort that his diſciples rather wanted learning then goodnes: becauſe, ſayd he, the function and grace of preaching is farre more gratefull to God then any other humane office, if it be eſpeciallie practiſed with a care of perfect charitie: adding with all that the poore and wretched preacher that deſpoiling himſelfe of pietie ſought

not the benefitt of ſoules in his preachinges, but only to pleaſe men for his particuler intereſt, deſerued to be lamented, ſo miſerable was his ſtate and condition. But more greiuous was his caſe that by his lewd life, he ſcandalized and ruyned more ſoules, then he gained by his doctrine. Herevpon he inferred that before ſuch Preachers was to be preferred a ſimple Religious man, who by his pious example and imitable life, induceth each one to vertue. Which is inſinuated by the wordes of S. Anne:
                        1. Reg. 2. Notable applicatiow of a place of ſcripture. 
                     Donec ſterilis peperit. Till the barren bring foorth many children: and ſhe that had many become infirme: vnderſtanding the barren to be the ſimple Religious, whoſe function is not to preach and by his doctrine to bring foorth any child vnto God: but att the day of the vniuerſall iudgement, it will appeare that, by his life, his example, his prayers, and his teares which he hath preſented vnto his diuine maieſtie, imploring him for the conuerſion of ſinners, he ſhall haue engendred many more in the Church of God, then diuers that preach, becauſe the iuſt iudge ſhall attribute them all vnto him for his merittes, and ſhall recompenſe him accordinglie. And the mother, that is, the Preacher that in exteriour apparence ſeemed to haue many children ſhall appeare infirme: becauſe he ſhall proue to haue no part in that, wherein he gloryed as proceeding from himſelfe and notfrom God. In reſpect wherof he would not that the Preachers ſhould be diſtracted and tranſported by cares and aſfaires of the world: but ſhould remayne retired and attentiue to prayer, as being elected by his diuine Maieſty, for publiſhing his holy word vnto ſinners. Therfore, ſaid he, the firſt thing that a Preacher ought to doe, is in priuate prayer to feed himſelfe with the ſpiritt of God: then, being himſelfe enflamed within, to communicate and impart vnto them, therby to enflame them without.
                  
                     How much S. Fr. honoured the office of preaching. The Function of preaching was by him reputed reuerend, &amp; ſo conſequentlie the Miniſters therof: Preachers, ſaid he, are the life of the body of the holy church, they are the champions and bucklers of ſoules againſt the deuill: they are the burning torches of the world. It cannot be eſteemed how worthy they are of honour if they be ſuch as they ought to be, and on the contrary, how 
                        ••
                     ch they deſerue pitty and compaſsion, if they ſell their doctrine,

                     r recompence of a vaine and tranſitorie applauſe. For which reſpect this holy Father could not endure ſuch that eſteemed more of themſelues for being eloquent and learned, then for being ſeruantes of the omnipotent God, and employed by his diuine Maieſty, in the moſt eminent degree that his Church affordeth: to thoſe whome he knew to be ſuch he ſaid: Wherfore doe yee glorie of them that are conuerted to penance by your preachinges as though yourſelues did conuert them, wheras my ſimple Religious doe alſo the ſame? And therfore, the preachers that entierlie applyed

themſelues to preaching without any deuotion he called euill diſpoſers of his goodes, and exceedingly extolled thoſe that had reſpect and memory of themſelues, after their preachinges rotyring and applying themſelues
                        Ioſ. 8. 18. &amp;c. to the ſpiritt of prayer, and to taſt how ſweet God is, after his example, who leauing his diſciples, retyred him ſelfe vnto the mountaines to pray.
               
               
                  Of the feruent piety and charity which S. Francis had towardes God and his ſaincts.
                  THE LII. CHAPTER.
                  WHo can euer expreſſe the feruent piety, wherwith the glorious Father S. Francis, the deere freind of his Spouſe IESVS CHRIST alwayes burned in his hart: conſidering that by meanes of this his feruour he was moſt often rapt out of himſelfe and ſo transformed in IESVS CHRIST, that itThat one ought not to denie almoſe demaunded for the loue of God. well appeared, that with the exteriour quill, the ſtringes of the inſtrument of his hart were touched within: Wherfore he affirmed that it was vnwonted and ouer abondant prodigality, to offer ſo great a price as the loue of God for an almoſe: and he tearmed them ſenſeles, who were ignorant therof, and who made more eſteeme of a baſe farthing then of ſuch a purchaſe, for ſo much as they refuſed that ſclender price, which ſufficed to buy heauen: beſides that the loue of him who hath ſo much loued vs, ought iuſtlie to be priſed and eſtoemed aboue althinges. And to the end himſelfe might be often ſtirred to this diuine loue, he conſidered althinges as proceeding from the hand of God: and ſo by the conſideration of creatures, he was with an admirable ſweetnes ſwallowed vp in the contemplation of a moſt high and firſt cauſe and fountaine of all eſſence and life, admiring in the beauty and compoſition of the ſecond cauſes, the moſt eminent and prudent Creator: and purſued the ſame euery where to his pleaſure, which he found by a thouſand new meanes &amp; manners, framing a continuall ladder of althinges created, wherby he aſcended to the comtemplation and fruition of this lord vniuerſally deſired, and att euery ſteppe of the ſaid ladder, he taſted, as in a litle brooke, of that moſt delicious fountaine of bounty, with an extreme pleaſure, as if he had heard that celeſtiall harmony and conſonance of the diuerſity of vertues, and of their effectes which God gaue to his creatures, for which 
                        •

                  He continually carryed his deſired croſſe, as a pleaſing litle bundle

of mirrh ſauouring in his hart: deſiring with all his power, to be transformed into it, therby to be enflamed with an exceſsiue loue, and to that end he had appointed lentes, in which he retired into hermitages to enioy in ſilence his amorous IESVS CHRIST, who as gratious failed not to reciprocate his deerly beloued in giuing him diuine conſolations.
                  
                     How deuout vnto the B. Sacrament. He burned with deuotion in the interiour of his bowels towardes the ſacred ſacrament, admiring that ſo charitable and exceſsiue diuine communication. And when he communicated, which was often, it was with ſuch and ſo great deuotion, that ſuch as were preſent were amazed and enforced to deuotion, ſeeing him ſo repleniſhed with this celeſtiall taſt, wherwith being as it were druncken, he was with all rauiſhed into mentall extaſy. And he was ſo zealous and reuerent therevnto, that fearing to handle it vnworthely, he euer refuſed to be Preiſt, yea being thereto vehemently ſollicited, and ſo farce foorth as he could no longer reſiſt. Wherfore he had recourſe to his ordinary defence, which was prayer, wherin demaunding Counſaile of God, an Angel appeared vnto him with a viol in his hand full of moſt pure and cleare liquor,Why S. Francis would not be Preiſt. who ſayd: Behold Francis, he that will adminiſter the moſt holy ſacrament, ought to be as pure as this liquor: in reſpect of which wordes, he had neuer thence forward deſire to be preiſt, eſteeming it no ſmall matter to be Deacon, ſith ſo great a purity was required in Preiſthood. And therfore he commanded the Superiours and all other Religious, to be carefull in the prouinces where they reſided, to aduertiſe and exhort the people, Clarkes and Preiſtes, to place the moſt ſacred body of our Lord in a decent place with all reuerence: and ſent them the mouldes and firſt formes or modeles of ſteele wherin to make the hoſties. He was alſo carefull to haue the altares and churches very neate and curiously adorned, and inHow deuout he was to the Virgin Mary. all his chapters made mention therof. He loued and reuerenced the glorious mother of our lord IESVS CHRIST, with ſuch Charity as cannot be expreſſed, in conſideration that ſhe had made the moſt high lord God our Brother, cloathing the diuine maieſty with our owne fleſh. Wherfore next after God, he repoſed all his hope in this glorious virgin, and euen from the originall of the inſtitution of his Religion, he made choice of her for his protectrice and aduocatrice vnto her Sonne: and for her honourTo S. Michel and to S. Peter &amp; S. Paul. and glory, he faſted as we haue formerly alleadged. After that, beſides and aboue all the other Angels whome he reuerenced (for the ſpeciall care they haue of vs) he was with an inſeparable bond of loue vinted vnto the Archangell S. Michael, in regard of his office, preſenting ſoules vnto God, and in deuotion vnto him, he faſted

forthy dayes before his feaſt. In this holy faſt it was, that he merited that notable fauour of the ſtigmagtes: as hereafter in place conuenient ſhalbe inſerted. Finally he was generaly enflamed in the memory of the glorious Saints affecting them with all his ſoule, as liuely ſtones of the celeſtiall edifice, ſhining and glittering with that immenſiue light, aboue all other reſplendant with the charity of IESVS CHRIST, and among them he eſpecially reuerenced with a ſinguler deuotion the Princes of the Apoſtles, S. Peter and S. Paul: for he went often to Rome expresly to viſitt them, and not in vaine ſith he was reciprocally by them viſited, protected and comforted in all occurances.
               
               
                  Of the great charity of S. Francis, towardes his neighbour, and how he freed his Brethren of temptations.
                  THE LIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe poore of IESVS CHRIST S. Francis, had but two peeces of mony (ſo called he the body and the ſoule) which vpon euery occaſion he offered for the loue of IESVS CHRIST: the one by an ardent feruour, and the other by abſtinence and diſcipline: ſacrificing the fleſh exteriourly in holocauſt, and interiourly burning in the temple of his ſoule, the ſweet incenſe of piety, eleuating his ſpiritt vnto God by a moſt ſeruent loue, and extending it by his interiour benignity, ouer all creatures that were aſſociated vnto him by nature and grace, and redeemed by the precious bloud of our lord IESVS CHRIST. He had not bin reputed the freind of IESVS CHRIST, if he had left deſolate the ſoules, redeemed by ſuch an ineſtimable price. Wherfore he affirmed that one ought to preferre the ſafty of ſoules before al thinges: ſith that the only Sonne of God the Father, would be crucified on the croſſe for their ſaluation. Therfore when he prayed, he poured out an infinite quantity of teares. When he preached he extremely heated himſelfe: and in this conſideration it was that he ſo rigorously afflicted his body: for it was not to puniſh it for ſinnes, which he had deſiſted to committe,Why S. Francis ſo much affiicted his body. 1. Cor. 13.
                      nor to preſerue himſelfe therefrom, by reaſon that the hand of God was with him. But it was to the end that by his example and merittes, he might free and deliuer the poore ſoules of IESVS CHRIST from that horrible and inſatiable gulphe of hell, vſing thoſe wordes of S. Paul: If I ſpeake with the tongues

of men, and of Angels and haue not charity, I giue no good education to my neighbour, and very litle doe I profitt others, and much leſſe my ſelfe.
                  Therfore he deuided this his charity as an abondant Fountaine intoHow much he honoured Preists &amp; Preachers: &amp; reſpected old men and thoſe that were in authority in the world and eſpecially the poore. many and diuers chanels, wherby he diſperſed it, louing and honouring each one in his degree and eſtate. He particulerly honoured Preiſtes as the Miniſters of God, which he performed with exceeding reuerence, acknowledging them to be ſanctified by diuine aucthority, with power to celebrate his ſacred miſtery, and to abſolue ſoules (his myſticall body) from deteſtable ſinnes. He would not ſee nor conſider any imperfection in them, as people that alwayes repreſented vnto him IESVS CHRIST. He left by teſtament vnto his diſciples this notable reſpect which he had vnto Preiſtes, and ſhewed by example that euery man ought to reuerence them, as perſonnes in whoſe authority next after God, conſiſteth the recouery of our ſaluation. He exceedinglie honoured Preachers and diuines, as they who adminiſtred vnto vs the ſpiritt and life of the word of God. He alſo much reſpected old people, and gaue due honour to men of power and authority in the world. But in eſpeciall manner did he ground his affection on the poore. He had peace and charity with all the world, and would that his Religious ſhould endeauour the like, that none might be ſcandalized or troubledHow much. He loued his diſciples. 2. Cor. 11
                      by their occaſion. He manifeſted vnto them the cordiall loue wherwith he affected them, as his children in IESVS CHRIST, in that he did not conuerſe with them, as their head, lord, or Superiour, but as Father, brother, and ſeruant, perticipating of all their neceſsityes, afflictions and temptations: ſo that he might well ſay with the Apoſtle: Who (among you) is weake, and I am not weake? who is ſcandalized, and I am not burnt? and on the other ſide he congratulated extremely att the ſpirituall progreſſe they made: he corroborated and conforted the feeble, and they that were tempted, as by theſe examples may appeare.
                  He was on a time entreated by one that was violently tempted, to pray vnto God for him: to whome, conforting him he ſaid: My child be not diſquieted, for this ought to be vnto thee an aſſured teſtimonie that thou art pleaſing and gratefull vnto God. None may eſteeme himſelfe the ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST, but in afflictions and temptations. There are many, though ignorant, that glory, not to haue taſted any infirmity, and not to know what temptation is, wheras they might iuſtly be greiued, and therby vnderſtand their weak ſpiritt and ſclender loue towardes God, and aſſuredly beleeue that they haue much more to endure in the other world. For God doth here

giuing them the meritt of a more worthy crowne, and doth neuer permitt them to be tempted aboue their forces: but cauſeth his ſeruantes to make great benefitt of theſe tēptations. The ſaid Religious was ſo comforted
                        1. Cor. 10.
                      by theſe wordes, that albeit he diſpoſed himſelfe thenceforward to endure and ſupport his tēptations, yet he incontinently felt all the bitternes he had ſuſtayned, to tourne into ioy and alacrity.
                  An other Religious being tempted with the ſpirit of blaſphemy, farre more inſupportable then any other, fell att his feet with abondance of teares and ſuch ſobbes, that he could not vtter ſo much as one word. Wherevpon the S. knowing the exceeding torment which this Religious endured, 
                        •
                     oued with pitty and zeale of his ſoule, he ſaid: I commandS. Franc. comman; deth the deuill. you, yee deuils, in the name of our lord IESVS CHRIST, that you preſume not henceforward to tempt this Religious, and he was incontinently deliuered, yea in the very inſtant. Here then appeared the deepe compaſsion of the holy Father, and his power againſt wicked ſpiritts.
               
               
                  How he trauailed towardes Siria, there to receiue Martirdome.
                  THE LIIII. CHAPTER.
                  
                     S. Franc. ordayned two generall chapters in the yeare. THe yeare of grace, '1212. the order of S. Francis ſtill floriſhing in nomber and in fame of ſanctitie, he ordayned that they ſhould twice in the yeare aſſemble att our lady of Angels, att the feaſt of Pentecoſt, and of S. Michael tharchangel, to ſuck the milke of Euangelicall pouertie from this their holy mother, and there to conferre of matters neceſſarie to their Order, and of accidentes occurring: as alſo to vnite themſelues in fraternall loue, animating each other in vertue of the ſpiritt. There were the preachers deputed to their places, and other obediences ordayned. The holie FatherGod would not that S. Franc. should ſuffer martyrdome which he ſo much ſought &amp; deſired. deſiring to aſsiſt not onlie the faithfull, but euen Infidell Pagans, to ſow the faith euery where, and to offer himſelfe in ſacrifice to the fire of Martyrdome, a liuely hoſt vnto God, and by his death after the example of IESVS CHRIST, to lay open vnto erring foules, the way of ſaluation, in the aforſaid yeare, which was the fourth of the inſtitution of his order, being no longer able to ſuppreſſe the flame of deſire of martyrdome, he reſolued to paſſe the ſea to goe preach vnto the Infidels in Siria. He embarqued himſelfe to this purpoſe, but the veſſell which carryed him was encountred with a moſt cruell tempeſt, that forced it into Sclauonia where he remayned diuers dayes: his companie refuſing to proceed any farther.
                  
                     
Wherfore perceauing himſelfe fruſtrated of his holy deſire, eſteeming it to arriue by the prouidence and pleaſure of his diuine maieſty: and vnderſtanding that there were certaine mariners retourning to Aucona, he beſought them for the loue of God to conduct him with hisThe shipmē would not admitt.

They perceiuing him to be extremelie poore and that no benifitt was to be gotten by him, they made excuſe that they had ſclender prouiſion. But the holy Father relying on the mercie of God, entred ſo ſecretlie with his companion into the ſhipp that they were not ſeen of the Patron. Being ſo hidden without the knowledge of any perſon to giue them to eat, an Angel ſodenlie appeared to a man in the ſhip that had the feare of God, to whome he gaue prouiſion for his ſeruant, ſaying. Take this food and diſpoſe it prouidentlie for the reliefe of the two Religious, that are hidden here within, whome he ſhewed vnto him: and when they ſhall haue need, be charitable vnto them. Hauing ſaid thus much he diſappeared, and what he had giuen in chardge, was performed. The marinersGod prouided food for S. Franc. and for other in the ship for his ſake. in meane while ſo long floted in ſtormes and tempeſtes, that they ſpent all their prouiſion, ſo that there only remayned in the ſhippe that releife which God had ſent vnto the S. which appearing to be but litle, did neuertheles in ſuch ſort augment, by the prayers of S. Francis, rendring good for euill, that it ſufficed for all them that were in the veſſell, till they arriued att their pretended port: which miracle being knowne vnto the Patron, he repented to haue refuſed to admitt them, for the loue of God, whoſe diuine Maieſtie notwithſtanding was pleaſed to ſhew ſuch a manifeſt miracle, to the end it might appeare how much more his ſeruantes do by their merittes, ſupport and vphold the world, then they are ſupported by it.
               
               
                  Of the Conuerſion of the glorious S. Clare and of the beginning of her Order.
                  THE LV. CHAPTER.
                  THe afforeſaid yeare, 1212. the glorious S. being by the diuineAbbridged out of the conuerſion of S. Clare. Maieſty recalled not without cōſideration of great conſequēce, from the voyage of Siria, he gaue a beginning to the Order of the Damianes, the roote and originall wherof, was the glorious mother S. Clare, deſcended of a noble familie of Aſsiſiū, who albeit by her parentes educated and nouriſhed deliciously, with intent to be afterward according to the manner of the world honourably marryed: the holy Ghoſt did notwiſtanding worck the contrary, and intended to enrich her

with celeſtiall treaſures. For which occaſion euen from her infancy, he had a very particuler care of her, with purpoſe to eſpouſe her vnto our Lord IESVS CHRIST. And when he thought the time conuenient, he permitted that, hearing admirable matters deliuered of the holy Father S. Francis, ſhe with a manly courage reſolued to follow him in the ſtrict way of euangelical perfection. Hauing then found opportunity, ſhe preſented her ſelfe alone to the ſaid S. and hauing diſcouered her hart vnto him, he inſtantly perceaued the inſpiration which ſhe had from God, and in very few howers giuing the farwell to her kinred, her ſubſtance, together with all the world, ſhe procured him to cutt of her haire, and to cloth her with his owne habitt, before the aulter of our Lady of Angels. For more ſecurity, the holy Father S. Francis committed her to the monaſtery of S. Paul, where were Religious of the Order of S. Benett, whence by reaſon of extreme perſecutions and violent proceedinges off her kinred hauing att length taken her out, he placed her in the Church of S. Damian, where was the firſt monaſtery of S. Clare, and by reaſon of their nomber that there encreaſed, they were called Damianes, as ſhall ſeuerally and verie particulerlie appeare in the eight booke, in the life of B. and glorious Saincte Clare.
               
               
                  How the S. went to Moroccho to ſeeke Martyrdome.
                  THE LVI. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Francis euer thirſting to be martyred for the faith of IESVS CHRIST, being peruented of his iorney into Siria, in the yeare 1214. he attēpted a voyage together with Brother Bernard &amp; Brother Macie, towardes Moroccho through Spaine, ſuppoſing thence to find paſſage vnto the Emperour of the Mores att Moroccho, called Miramoline, to preach vnto him the faith of IESVS CHRIST. He enterpriſed this iorney with ſuch alacritie, that albeit he were very feeble and infirme; he notwithſtanding did alwayes ſo much out goe his companions that he ſeemed to fly. But being arriued in Spaine, his infirmityes did ſo oppreſſe him, that he could hardly trauell vnto S. Iames in Galicia, where proſtrating himſelfe before the altare of the ſaid S. and praying with his accuſtomed feruour, God enioyned him to retourne into Italie, becauſe many places were offered vnto him wherin to accommodate his family, and that his retourne thither was very neceſſary, to confirme the greene places of his erected vingneyard.
                  In this iorney S. Francis was att Guimaranes a citty of Portugall,

where it is ſaid that he rayſed the daughter of the maſter of the houſe where he lodged: thence he viſited the queene Vracca wife of king Alfonſus the ſecond, who beheld him with great reuerence and deuotion▪ and was exceedingly comforted and edified by him. Proceeding afterward on his iorney, he lighted on a riuer in the ſaid prouince of S. Iames, betweene the citties of Nonis and Orgogno, which he knew no meanes how to paſſe by reaſon there was not any houſe in that part nor perſonne to conduct him ouer. Not knowing then what to doe he had recourſe to prayer, and att the very inſtant whiles he was praying to God, there came a boy from the citty of Nonis, who hauing pitty of them, gaue thē encouragment ſaying, that hauing paſſed ouer his horſes that were loaden with bread, he would vnload them and retourning, would conduct them ouer: which he performed, and hauing guided them to Orgogno, he lodged them in a houſe of his where he putt his bread, wherin he gaue them the beſt entertainement he could deuiſe: for which the holy Father gaue him many thanckes att his departure, and ſaid: God giue you the payment which he hath promiſed to good people: and ſo departed.
                  That very yeare (which is worthy admiration) this yong man retourning from Rome hauing viſited the Apoſtles S. Peter and S. Paul he demaunded of God as a ſpeciall grace that he would pleaſe to take him out of this world before he loſt the meritte of ſo many holy indulgences which he had gotten. His prayer was not fruſtrate, for by the merittes of the bleſſed Father S. Francis, as by the conſequence is apparent, God heard him from heauen, and ſo he died in the very pilgrimage. His Father by letters from freindes being aduertiſed of his death, after much lamentation, procured the office of piety to be performed for his ſoule, att the end of which office, there appeared in theSeuenty Frier Minors were miraculouſly tranſported from Italy into Spaine att the ſeruice of a benefactour of S. Francis. ſaid citty of Nonis, about ſeuenty Frier Minors, though thoſe people neuer ſuppoſed ſo many to be in all the world, and they were all preſent att the church in proceſsion, ſinging with ſuch melodie and with ſo pious a ſweetnes, that they drew teares of deuotion from all the audience. After they had ſung maſſe, the parentes of the deceaſed inuited them to eat with them, which they did, and then departed, and a great multitude of thoſe people conducted them very farre: the table was afterward found furniſhed with meate, as if they had not eaten. This miracle being perceaued, many ran after them to ſee if they could recouer them, and know the place of their reſidence, but they could neuer ſee nor heare of them. It was then iudged, that this was the recompence of the curteſy which the deceaſed had done to S. Francis and his companions, when he entertained them att Orgogno: and thence, forward thoſe people were euer exceeding deuot vnto the Freer Minors.
                  
                     
In the ſame iorney betweene Barcelone and Ghirone, neere vnto S. Celony, one of the companions of S. Francis being very hungry entred into a vineyard which he happelie found there and did eat of the grapes. The keeper of the vines hauing perceaued it, tooke from him his cloake (which he very patientlie permitted him to take) and would not reſtore it whatſoeuer inſtance S. Francis vſed: but carryed it to his maſter,A litle after 22. Freer Minors came alſo from Italy into Spaine att the obſequies of their benefactour. of whome the ſaid S. ſo graciously demaunded it, that he did not only reſtore it, but withall inuited him to eat with him, where he in ſuch ſort comported himſelfe, that this good man entierlie edified by the wordes of the S. and by his doctrine, offered himſelfe to be a perpetuall hoſt vnto all the Freer Minors that thenceforward ſhould paſſe that way. To whome the S. reciprocally replyed: I accept thee for a Freer of our Order: and ſo proceeding in continuall performance of that charity when they paſſed that way, he died many yeares after: and as his kinred procured his obſequies to be performed, where were preſent many Preiſtes, ſome did deridingly beginne to murmure, ſaying that the Freer Minors did not appeare att the death of one of their ſo affectionate Brethren, of who they had receaued ſo many curteſies: and vpon the deliuerie of theſe wordes there came two and twentie Religious, ſinging the Pſalmes of Dauid with an exceeding melodious harmony, who hauing finiſhed the office in the Church, did all diſappeare. The kinred of the deceaſſed prepared for them to eat: but they reſted content with only giuing thanckes to God with the reſt of the people, for the recompence he affordeth thoſe that entertayne his ſeruantes, euen after their death. It was then ordayned in that citty, that the Freer Minors ſhould thenceforward there be lodged and entertayned with all thinges neceſſary att the chardge of the common purſe. S. Francis paſsing afterward through the kingdome of France, preaching in a hoſpitall att Montpelier, he prophetically foretold that in that citty ſhould ſhortlie after be erected a monaſtery of FreerS. Franc. foretold future thinges. Minors, which was accordingly verified ſoone after, in that a Couent was there built which was very worthely mayntayned, till the fury of the Caluinian hereſie did vtterly ruinate the ſame.
               
               
                  Of the firſt meeting of S. Francis and S. Dominick.
                  THE LVII. CHAPTER.
                  THe yeare of grace 1215. when the firſt generall Councell was held att Lateran, during the raigne of Pope Innocentius the third, the holy Father S. Dominick was att Rome with the Biſhop of Tolous called Falcon, to procure the Popes confirmatiō of

the Order of Preachers which he then intended to inſtitute and eſtabiſh: wherof the Pope being by diuine reuelation aduertiſed, and enformed of the great fruit that this Order ſhould produce vniuerſally to the holy Church, att his firſt vew of S. Dominick, without farther notice of him, incontinently commanded him to retourne vnto Tolouſe, and to conferre with his Religious touching the penning of a rule that might be approued by the Church, vnder which his Religion might be confirmed. S. Dominick then retourning to Tolouſe, and hauing with his Religious implored the diuine aſsiſtance, they made election of the rule of S. Auguſtine, with the name and title of Preachers. The yeare following being 1216. (Honorius the third ſucceeding Pope Innocent the third) retourning to Rome, he demaunded of the Pope that then ſucceeded, the ſaid confirmation with the Bull and apoſtolicall authority, in vertue wherof to make profeſsion, and with allA viſion of S. Dominick. to adde other conſtitutions that ſeemed neceſſary. All which hauing obtayned, the night enſuying he ſaw in prayer our Lord IESVS CHRIST att the right hand of God againſt ſinners in an hideous and terrible manner: brandiſhing three launces in the aire againſt the world: the firſt to ſuppreſſe the hautines of the proud: the ſecond to diſgorge the ouer-ſtuffed entrailes of the auaricious: and the third to maſſacre the carnall. There was none that could reſiſt this wrath, but the virgin Mary his moſt ſacred mother, whome he ſaw moſt affectionately to embrace the feet of her ſonne, beſeeching him to pardon thoſe whome he had redeemed with his precious bloud, and with the mixture of his infinite mercy to delay that his rigorous iuſtice. Then he heard our Lord thus anſweare her: See you not mother how manie iniuryes they doe me? how is it poſsible that my holy iuſtice permitt ſo many enormityes to be vnpuniſhed? His moſt gracious mother thus replyed: Thou knoweſt my deere Sonne, what is the way to conuert ſinners vnto thee: but behold here a faithfull ſeruant of thine, whome thou mayſt preſently ſend into the world to preach thy word to men: that being conu

Francis, with whome he ſaw God to be ſatisfied. Now S. Dominick awaking very well retayned the markes wherby he might know this his companion, whome he neuer knew before. But the day following, by diuine prouidence he mett S. Francis, who was then in the Church of ſaint Peter att Rome, whome he incontinently knew by the markes which he had obſerued in the ſaid viſion. Then he ran and verie affectionatelie embraced him and ſaid: we ſhalbe companions and ſhall labour together in our holie purpoſe, and neither any man

nor wicked ſpiritt, ſhall haue power to preuaile againſt vs. At length he recounted vnro him the ſaid viſion. And after long diſcourſe together, they remayned vnited in God with one hart, will, and ſpiritt. They commanded the like vnto their brethren: This viſion was imparted vnto the Religious of ſaint Dominick by ſaint Francis his meanes, to whome onlie the ſaid ſaint had recounted the ſame.
               
               
                  How theſe two SS. had ſight of each other an other time att Rome, and how they reiected the benefices that were preſented to them and to their Religious
                  THE XLVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THeſe two eminent lightes ſent of God to illuminate the world, did an other time meet together att Rome in Cardinall Hoſties houſe, who for the great zeale he carryed to the Church of God, and for the deuotion wherwith he reſpected them both, ſaid vnto them: In the primitiue Church the Prelates were poore, and liued without any vanity, gouerning the flock of Chriſt with loue and humility, not by deſire of terreſtriall and temporall thinges: therfore in myne opinion the holie church would retourne to her primitiue eſtate, if of your Religious we ſhould make Biſhops and Prelates, becauſe by their doctrine, good example of life, and by contempt of the world, they would repreſent to the whole world the Prelates of the primitiue church; or att leaſt they would be farre better then we, who liue ordinarilie in vanities, becauſe they are inſtructed and educated in humilitie and pouertie, and therfore touching this point I ſhall be glad to know your opinion. The Cardinall being ſilent, there aroſe a pious contention betweene the two holie Fathers which of them ſhould firſt anſweare. Att lenght S. Francis ſuperiour of humility, left the ſuperiorityWhy S. Dominick and S. Franc. would not their Religious should haue bevefices. of obedience vnto S. Dominick, wherby he anſweared the Cardinall in theſe wordes: The Dominican Preachers are in a ſufficient good and high eſtate, if they can conceaue it, and therfore for as much as ſhall lye in my power, I will neuer conſent that they aſcend to higher dignitie. And then ſilent S. Francis aroſe, and with great vehemencie thus ſpake: My Religious are called Minors, onlie in reſpect that they neuer preſume to be made great in this world, and much leſſe to be Prelates: ſo that their title ſheweth them their true vocation, which is to remayne alwayes in their meanneſſe, and to tread

the ſteppes of humility of IESVS CHRIST, that they may meritt to be exalted in the other world among the bleſſed. Therfore if you will that they fructifie in the Church of God, keep them low, as they are, yea if they would aſpire to prelacie, neuer conſent thervnto. Here was the S. ſilent alſo. The Cardinall remayning exceeding well ſatisfiedS. Dominick barc out of deuotion a girdle of S. Fr. with theſe two anſweares, diſmiſſed the S. who goeing together, S. Dominick moſt inſtantly requeſted of S. Frācis the cord wherewith he was girded, who after he had of humility much denyed him, was att laſt content to be ouercome by charity, and vngirding himſelfe gaue it vnto him: S. Dominick out of great deuotion girded himſelfe therwith vnder his habitt: and afterward they departed each from other. S. Dominick vſed theſe ſpeeches generally to all men: I ſpeake it in verytie, all other Religious ought to admire and imitate the life of this man, ſo great is his perfection, and ſo true the way which he hath vndertaken to follow IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  How S. Francis proceeded in ſending his Religious ouer all Christendome, and deuided vnto them the prouinces.
                  THE LIX. CHAPTER.
                  IN the yeare of grace, 1217. the generall chapter being held att Aſſiſium, by reaſon of the great multitude of Religious that were there preſent, the Prouinces were aſsigned, as well on this ſide, as beyond the Mountaines throughout all Chriſtendome. Then were elected Prouincials, with companions and perſonnes deputed to their obedience: and becauſe then there were not a few heretikes in Spaine, he ſent thither his Religious: and among other Brother Zacharie and Brother Walter trauelled euen to Portugall, who as an vnwonted ſpectacle were very ill entreated, as well in regard of the nouelty or rarenes of their habitt, as for the diuerſity of their language: and ſuſpecting them to be heretikes, they were not permitted to reſt in any place: wherfore they addreſſed themſelues to the ſaid Queene Vracha, by whoſe fauourable protection they were receaued att Coymbra, Guymarances, Alanquer, and Lisbone, as hereafter with the reſt of their life ſhalbe declared in the ſixt booke. The others were much worſe entreated, no man yelding to receaue them not knowing whence they were, and therfore they were euery where driuen away, eſpecially becauſe they brought not authenticall letters from the Pope, that might giue teſtimony ofThe Freer Minors were not permitted to preach but were expelled for hauing no bull from the Pope. their condition. Wherfore they were conſtrayned to retourne vnto S. Francis, who incontinentlie aduertiſed the Cardinall Hoſtie therof, then made protectour of the Order, after the death of the Cardinall of

Sebaſtian, who was their firſt protectour, but not according to the forme of theire Order as this was, who offered himſelfe to S. Francis for ſuch, and for a Brother of the Order: whome alſo the S. himſelfe required of the Pope to be their Protectour.
                  The holie Father being then by the ſaid Cardinall of Hoſtie preſented vnto his holynes and to the colledge of Cardinals, he deliuered vnto them a notable oration of the praiſe of Euangalicall perfection, wherof himſelfe and his Religious were Profeſſours, with ſuch and ſo great ſeruour, that he put all the Colledge into exceeding admiration and deuotion towardes his Religion: who thervpon promiſed him all fauour. He eſteemed himſelfe happy, who after the Conſiſtory was ended, could haue a Freer Minor in his companie. And the Pope cauſed letters patentes to be made him, wherof the tenour was ſuch: Honorius biſhop, and ſeruant of the ſeruantes of God, to our welbeloued, and as our Brethren, Arch-biſhops and Biſhoppes,The briefe of Pope Honorious in approbation of the Freer Minors, and to permitt them to preach. our welbeloued ſonne, Brother Francis of Aſsiſium, and his companions of the Order of Minors, hauing, after they had contemned and abandonned the vanities of this world, choſen the way and life of perfection, with iuſt reaſon approued of this holy Church, and ſowing the word of God, in imitation and example of the Apoſtles, through diuerſe Prouinces: We pray and command you in vertue of holie obedience, by theſe preſentes our Apoſtolicall letters, that when any of them ſhall repaire vnto you, with theſe ſaid preſentes, you receaue them as Catholiques, and true beleeuers: and that, for the reuerence of God, whoſe true ſeruantes they are, and ours alſo, you ſhew them fauour and curteſie. Giuen att. Etc. The ſaid letters were ſigned by the Protectour and other Cardinals, to the glorie of God, and the benefitt of ſoules.

Hauing formerlie written vnto you in the behalfe of

our welbelourd children the Freer Minors, praying you to haue them in recommandation: as we are giuen to vnderſtand, ſome of you being yet ſcrupulous of this Order, permitt not them to ſeiourne in their biſhopprickes, though in deed there is in them nothing deſeruing ſuſpicion, as we haue bin very preciſely enformed and aſſured, and therefore our letters ought to ſuffice to diſpoſſeſle them of all ſiniſter opinion, that they might formerly conceaue of them. We therfore certifie and giue teſtimony to each one, that we hold the Order of Freer Minors for approued, and know the Brethren of the ſaid Order to be Religious Catholikes, deuout and of pious conuerſation: and therfore we admoniſh, and by theſe preſentes oblige you, to admitt the ſaid Freer Minors into your biſhopprickes, and to hold them highly recommendable, for reuerence of God, and of vs, Giuen att Viterbium, the eight and twentieth of May, the fourth yeare of our Popedome.
                  In the very ſame yeare his Holines wrote other letters of the ſame tenour, in fauour of the ſaid Religion, which are recorded to be extent in the Couent of Paris.
               
               
                  How S. Francis would come into France. and what befell him in the way.
                  THE LI. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Francis in an other of the foreſaid Chapters, wherin the Freer Minors were diſtributed ouer Chriſtendome, addreſſed himſelfe to all the Religious and ſaid: My beloued Brethren, I acknowledge my ſelfe obliged to giue edification to all the Brethren: therefore my children being ſent into diuers Prouinces, to endure hungar, thirſt; labour, and other neceſsities, it ſeemeth reaſonable that my ſelfe doe likewiſe trauaile into ſome farre country, to the end that others the more voluntarily ſupport their afflictions, when they ſhall ſee me vndertake the like: and therfore (his manner being neuer to ſend forth any Religious, but firſt to pray vnto God that he would afford ſome fruit to be reaped therby) hauing with all his Brethren made prayer for himſelfe, he aroſe,Greant deuotion to the B. Sacrament in France. and ſaid: In the name of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, of his moſt ſacred mother, and of all the SS. of God, I make choiſe of the prouince of France, wherin there are many Catholike people, and ſubiect to the holy Romane Church, and becauſe they be exceeding deuout vnto the moſt bleſſed Sacrament, I beleeue I ſhall receaue much conſolation in conuerſing with them: hauing ſaid thus

much, and choſen two companions, he tooke his leaue of his Religious, and enterpriſed his iorney.
                  Being arriued att the citty of Arezzo, and not permitted to enter there, becauſe it was night, he lodged att an hoſpitall in the ſuburbes, where he vnderſtood that the miſerable cittizens of that place being diuided into two factions, did cruelly murder one an other. And the more to confirme the matter, as he was att his prayers about midnight, he heard ſuch a noiſe of men and armour, that they ſeemed to be to armies ready to aſſault each other: wherby he perceaued manifeſtlie, the worck of the deuill that mayntayned them in warre. Wherefore moued with compaſsion, he ſpent the reſt of that nightS. Franc. pacifieth a great ſedition by certaine wordes which he cauſed one of his Religious to vtter. in prayer with much feruour and abondance of teares: then he called Brether Silueſter, a Preiſt, and man of worthy faith and puritie, to whome he ſaid: Goe you to the gate of this miſerable citty, and cry with a loud voice, the name of our Lord IESVS CHRIST be prayſed and bleſſed. Ye deuils that keepe theſe people in warre and ſedition: I command you on the part of almighty God, and in the vertue of holy obedience, to depart all out of this citty: which Brother Silueſter hauinge done, the deuils incontinentlie fled; and ſo without any other prediction, or any other meane, the ſaid citizens were reunited and appeaſed. S. Francis being deſirous to proſecute his iorney, would not then ſtay in that citty, but preaching vnto them afterward att his retourne, he ſharply reprehended them for their hatredes that had ſo furiously and inhumanelie enraged them againſt each other, and gaue them to vnderſtand the great grace which God had giuen thē, by meane of the ſaid wordes which were vttered by Brother Silueſter, that was a holy man (not to ſpeake of himſelfe) deliuering them from the deuils, that maintayned them in ſo cruell a warre. By theſe conſiderations the S. exceedingly confirmed them in the peace already concluded, and beſides induced them to doe penance for their ſinnes.
               
               
                  How the S. by commandement of the Cardinall Protectour of his Order, was intercepted of his iorney.
                  THE LXII. CHAPTER.
                  BEing att Florence he there foūd the protectour of his order, who was legat of his holines in that place. The holy Father goeing to viſitt him recoūted vnto him the cauſe of his iorney, that he was trauelling into France, there to plant his Order, &amp; to gaine ſoules, wherin he mēt to employ ſome time: which the Cardinall vnderſtāding, was exceedingly diſquieted, &amp; endeuoured to perſuade him by pregnāt reaſons

to change his reſolution, conſidering that he might doe greater ſeruice
                        •
                      to God in Italie, and ſhould benifitt more to ſupport and mayntaine his Religion, where it was already knowen, then otherwhere. The S. anſweared that the cauſe that moſt moued him to goe thither was, that he thought it not reaſonnable, that hauing ſent his Religious into diuers forraine Contryes, to endure many inconueniences, he ſhould reſt in repoſe, whiles they ſuffered and endured. The Cardinal replyed: Wherfore haue you ſent your Religious ſo farre, to vndergoe ſo many afflictions? The holy Father anſweared him: Thincke you, my Lord, that God hath inſtituted this Religion for the good only of the Italian ſoules? You muſt know that he hath choſen the Freer Minors, to goe ouer all the world, yea not onlie for the behoufe of faithfull Chriſtians, but euen of Infidelles. And they ſhall goe, and ſhall there be receaued, and ſhall fructifie, gayning many ſoules to God: who will prouide them all their neceſsities, when men ſhall faill them. The Cardinal admiring the good and pious reſolution of the S. confeſſed to beleeue that it would arriue as he had deſigned, neuertheles would he neuer permit him to goe into France. Wherfore S. Francis not minding any further to contradict him, deſiſted his iorney to content him, and ſent thither in his place Brother Pacificus and his other companiōs, and himſelfe hauing ſeiourned ſome time with the ſaid Protectour, retourned to our Lady of Angels.
               
               
                  Of the great generall chapter, called the chapiter of Mattes.
                  THE LXIII. CHAPTER

Bonauenture, about fiue thouſand, which would ſeeme ſomewhat difficult to beleeue (if ſuch a S. did not teſtifie it) that this holy Order was ſo multiplied in ſo ſhort a ſpace. Whiles this chapiter was held, Pope Honorius was withall his Court att Peruſia, and the aforeſaid Protectour of this order went to Aſsiſium, whence he viſited them euery day. He celebrated maſſe and preached vnto them, conceauing exceeding ioy to ſee fifty or an hundred of his ſoldiers of IESVS CHRIST walking in open feild vnited together, ſome employed in pious diſcources of God, others in diuine offices, others in ſome other worckes of charitie, and others ſeparated in contemplation: and all this was performed with ſuch and ſo exact a ſilence, that there was

not heard any noyſe att all. So the ſaid Cardinall, as alſo all the Lordes of the Popes Court filled with extreme deuotion, did both admire and exceedingly reioyce interiourly, yea as much as was poſsible, ſeeing thoſe wordes of Iacob to be verified in ſo gteat a multitude of the ſeruantes of God. Theſe are the Campes of God, and his dwelling is here:
                        Gen. 32. conſidering that their lodgeings were in the wilde feildes, made of ruſhes and mattes by them of Aſsiſium, and contriued as a dormitory: therfore was this chapter called the chapter of Mattes or ruſhes. Their beddes were, either the bare ground, or a litle chaffe, the bolſter a ſtone or blocke of wood, each one was ſo edified with this company, that many Cardinals, Biſhops, great Lordes, and Gentlemen came from farre of deuotion to ſee this holy and humble congregation: ſo that it well appeared that the like had neuer bene ſeene in the world. Many alſo came only to ſee and honour the glorious head S. Francis, who in ſo ſhort a time, had ſelected out of the world ſo many and ſo worthy members, and (as a ſage Paſtour) had guided ſuch a numerable and precious flock, in the meadoes and ſpirituall paſtures of IESVS CHRIST.
                  Now all the Religious being arriued, the ſaid S. cauſed them to aſſemble together, then aroſe he as their Captaine, entierlie enflamed of the holy ghoſt, and gaue them the delicious and forcible food of the word of God, and with a deuout and loud voice, he made them a ſermon, whereof the theme was ſuch: My beloued Brethren, we haueThe ordinary ſermon of S. Fr. vnto his brethrē. promiſed great matters: but much greater ate promiſed vs, lett vs obſerue thoſe, and aſpire after theſe. The pleaſure of ſinne is ſhort: but the paine therof perpetuall. Vertue is painefull: but the glory is infinite. Many are called▪ but few are choſen, and in fine all ſhalbe rewarded. Vpon which wordes he ſo ſubtilly diſcourſed that euerie one was amazed therat. Afterward he exhorted them all to obedience vnto the holy Church, and to the exerciſe of prayer, a moſt efficacious meane to purchace the loue of God, charity, edification of their neighbour, to patience, and labours, to neatnes and purity of life, to haue peace with God, amitie with men, humility and ſweetnes with all. He likewiſe exhorted them to ſolitude, to watchinges, to reſiſt the temptations of the deuill, and withall ſeriously recommended vnto them the feruent zeale of Euangelicall pouerty, contempt of the world and of themſelues: breifely to apply all their cogitation of ſoule and body on the moſt high Creatour, Redeemer and true Paſtour of ſoules our Lord IESVS CHRIST. And to teachS. Franc. would not that any of his should take care for their nourishment. Pſal. 54.
                      them all the aforeſaid, rather by effect then by word, he commanded vnder vertue of obedience, that none ſhould take care to prouide what to eat or drinck or any other thing neceſſary to their entertainement:

But that they ſhould only applie themſelues to the praiſe of God and to prayer, with theſe wordes of the Pſalmiſt, which he often iterated: Cast thy cogitation in God, and he will releiue thee. All obeyed him without hauing care of any thing, and ſo, void of all other temporall care, they entierlie employed themſelues in prayer and prayſe of God.
               
               
                  How the holy Father S. Dominick was preſent att this great chapter. And of the reſolution he made that his Religious should not thenceforward poſſeſse any thing of proper, for the great miracle he ſaw there: and of the great nomber of Nouices that were receaued att the ſaid chapter.
                  THE LXIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Dominick was preſent att this great chapter with ſeauen of his Religious, and hauing vnderſtood the rigorous commandement of the holy Father S. Frācis, he was vtterly amazed: fearing perhappes, in regard of his great loue vnto him, that ſome ſcandall might happen, hauing there ſo great a multitude, and no order taken for their releife. But our Lord IESVS CHRIST did quickly manifeſt what care he had of his ſeruantes, (who as birdes did fly in ſpiritt, and conuerſed continually in heauen) to feed them on earth: for he touched the hartes of the people of Peruſia, Spoletum, Follingnium, Aſsiſium, and other neighbour places, yea of all the valley of Spoletum, who by diuine inſpiration, came all with vnſpeakeableS. Dominick confeſseth his fault before S. F. in that he had ſiniſterly iudged of the ſaid prohibitiō which he had giuen to his Religious. ſpeed as by a ſtriuing emulation, with horſes, mules, aſſes and chariottes, all loaden with bread, wine, oyle, cheeſe, fleſh, foule, egges, butter, and other thinges neceſſary for releife: others loaden with earthen veſſels, as pottes, cuppes, iugges, and other veſſels for their vſe, alſo with linnen and other commodities, euen with cloth, to couer them, finally they were moſt abondantlie ſupplied of whatſoeuer they needed: he eſteemed himſelfe happy, that could beſt and moſt deuoutlie ſerue them: there might one ſee kinghtes and other noble men to putt off, and ſpread one the ground their owne cloakes, to honour theſe poore of IESVS CHRIST. In like ſort were ſeene many Prelates and deuout gentlemen to ſerue them with like reuerence, as they could haue done the Apoſtles.
                  This the bleſſed Father S. Dominick hauing ſeene, he aſſuredlie knew that the holy Ghoſt really dwelt in the ſeruant of God S. Francis: Wherfore ſharpelie reprehending him ſelfe for the raſh iudgment he had conceaued, he fell one his knees before him, confeſſed

Therfore (ſaid he) I promiſe alſo to obſerue Euangelicall pouerty, and henceforth on the part of God I giue my malediction to all the Religious of my Order, that from this time ſhall poſſeſſe any thing in propriety, be it in common or particuler. And therfore albeit they might before haue rentes and poſſeſsious, as indeed they had, which they enioyed according to the graunt made them by Pope Honorius the third, in the yeare of grace 1216. the firſt yeare of his Popedome, yet the yeare 1220. which was the yeare after this great chapter, S. Dominick alſo holding a generall chapter where there were preſent two hundred and twentie of his Religious, they did together reforme their conſtitutions, and renounced the ſaid poſſeſsions which they then enioyed, and ſuch as theyThere were 220 Iacobins preſent at a general chapter held by S. Dom. might thenceforward enioy. By which obligation, though the Order of Preachers, may, by iuſt diſpenſation, in reſpect of the great fruit they produce in the Church, with their doctrine, haue reuenowes for their Colledges, and ſtudies: yet the other monaſteries, according to the commandement and malediction of their Father S. Dominick, doe ſtrictlie obſerue Euangelicall pouerty.
                  The Cardinall of Hoſtia brought to this chapter a great multitude of Lordes, to ſee the manner of lodgeing of theſe Religious, who ſeeing them to ſitt, eat, and sleepe one the bare ground, or one a litle chaffe or hay, without reſpecting other delicacie, and that for pillow they had a ſtone or block of wood, as we haue ſaid: they beat their breſtes, and weeping ſaid: If theſe holy men eat and sleepe one the earth, what ſhall become of vs wretched ſinners, that loadenIn this chapter of S. Fr. were receaued more thē

Thus many being well edified by this holy troup, endeauoured to change their life and manners into vertuous conuerſation. Their behauiour was ſuch, and the edification of his Holines Court, of the Cardinals, and other great perſons, as alſo of all the neighbour people, that there were more then fiue hundred Nouices receaued in that only Chapter

Francis hauing bin enformed, that in this chapter were many Religious, who to mortifie their fleſh, beſides their other abſtinences, faſtes and diſciplines, did weare inſteed of haire, a ſhirt of maille, and certaine groſſe hoopes of iron about theire loynes, which procured them diuers ſickneſſes, and euen that ſome died therewith: the pitifull Father commanded, by vertue of obedience that there ſhould be brought him all the ſaid mailles and hoopes: and in an inſtant were brought him fiue hundred of the one &amp; the other ſort: wherfore he preſently there vpon made a cōſtitution, that none ſhould preſume thenceforward to weare any ſort of iron on their fleſh.
                  There were in this Chapter certaine learned ſuperiours, who practiſed with their Protectour ſome meane to temperate the rigour of that their ſo extreme pouerty and liuing, and to moderate it according to ſome other ancient rule: that ſhunning extremities, they might chooſe one more ſupportable. Which being by the ſaid Cardinall, whoMonopolie of certaine ſuperiours and learned Freer Minors to moderate the rule of their Order. alſo would haue him condiſcend thervnto, related vnto the holy Father S. Francis, he tooke him by the hand and led him to the chapter where thoſe ſaid ſuperiours were yet aſſēbled, to whom addreſsing his ſpeech, he ſaid: My beloued Brethren, our moſt mercifull Lord God hath called me vnto him by this way of ſimplicity, pouerty, humility, and of this great aſperity of life, and not only my ſelfe, but all thoſe that will follow me: therfore lett none of you thincke euer to make me eſpouſe an other rule, be it of S. Auguſtin, S. Bernard, or any other, for my God hath ſhewed me this, hath called vs vnto it, and will that we be reputed inſenſible in this world, becauſe he will guide vs to heauen by an other path then this of the humane reaſons of your ſottiſh prudence and ignorance, wherewith you are confounded, yea I am ſo much aſſured from his diuine maieſty, that he will chaſtice you by his executioners, the deuils, and then will remitt you into your former eſtate, whence you are now fallen, though it beagainſt your will, if firſt you doe it not of your ſelues. This ſaid he left them with this worthy, concluſion. The Cardinall hauing heard ſo reſolute and terrible an anſweare, vtterly amazed

att the great zeale of God which he demōſtrated, durſt not reply ſo much as one word, and the ſaid ſuperiors with ſuch an exceeding terrour and feare of worſe ſucceſſe, remayned mute.
                  A litle after the ſaid chapter, it was reuealed vnto the S. that whiles it was held, many thouſandes of deuils being aſſembled att the hoſpitall betweene our Lady of Angels, and Aſsiſium, held an other, where wereThe deuils hold a chapter to ruinate the order of S.

The other deuils approuing this opinion, departed full of hope of a future reuenge, which would to God had not in part ſo arriued.

                  THE LXVI. CHAPTER.
                  IN the expeditiō of the foreſaid great generall Chapter, all the ChriſtianS. Franc. ſendeth his brethren to preach vnto infidels. and Pagan Prouinces were deputed to certaine Fathers, who were ſent thither, with their companiōs, carrying the letters patētes of the Pope, in fauour wherof they were very ioyfully receaued, and curteously entertayned of the Prelates and people; among others, ſix were ſent vnto the citty of Morocco, among the Mores, of whome one remayned ſick in Spaine, and the other fiue that went thither were gloriously martyred, as in the fourth booke ſhalbe declared.
                  Many alſo were ſent vnto Tunes, there to preach againſt the falſe ſect

of Mahomet, with Brother Giles the third diſciple of S. Francis, who being there arriued, were, by the merchantes with whome they came, putt againe into the ſhippes againſt their willes, for feare they might incurre ſome dommage by their occaſion, and ſo were ſent againe into Italy: there were alſo ſent into diuers other places: for many religiou

                      entreated it of the S. for the deſire they had of Martyrdome, wherfore to giue them confort, he permitted them to goe: they did much fructifie in diuers places, as in their liues ſhall appeare, becauſe hauing repoſed all their confidence in God, he wrought many miracles by them, and miraculously releiued them in their neceſsities, as in the accidentes following, here placed for example doth appeare.
                  
                     How God ſusteined the trauelling Freer Minors in their neceſsities. Many of the ſaid Religious being in very vaſt mountaines, were exceedingly afflicted with thirſt, by reaſon of the extreme heat that then was: ſo that it could not be more violent; when they came to any fountaine (where hauing had the benediction of their ſuperiour, they drāck their fill of that water, which they well knew to be more diuine then terreſtriall) conſidering that they found themſelues therby ſo corroborated and reuiued that in vertue therof, they coutagiously performed the reſt of their iorney, they yelded thanckes to God for the ſame.
                  Two others trauailling according to the Apoſtolicall manner (without wallet) and hauing ſpent almoſt, a whole day in trauaile, without getting any bread, were ſo enffeebled with hungar, that their extremety ſeemed att the full, yet did it proue more, when comming into a Church, and demaunding a litle bread for the loue of God, of the preiſt therof, the honeſt man anſweared that he had it not: wherfore the poore Religious paſsing on in a kind of deſpaire, mett on the way a yong man, who hauing ſaluted them, began to queſtion with them in this manner: whither goe you ſo ſorrowfull and heauy that you appeare to be ouerchardged therewith? they anſweared, that finding none that would giue them bread, they walked whither their hungar did lead thē, wherof they feared to die, this yong man preſently replyed: goe to ſitt downe and eat, here are two loaues. Whiles they were eating, he began to diſcouer who he was, ſaying vnto them: O men of litle faith, why diſtruſt you the prouidence of God? why remember you not thoſe wordes

                  THE LXVII. CHAPTER.
                  BVt what happened vnto two Religious that were ſent into Arragon is verie admirable: being receaued in Lerida, by an honorable gentleman called Raymod de Barriaco, verie deuout vnto the Order of S. Francis, they perſuaded him to build them an oratorie without the towne; aſſuring him that by ſuch diſburſement his monie would not diminiſh: wherto giuing credit, he ſo ſeriouslie ſett labourers on worck, that in ſhort time the building was verie forward. Now ſending his ſeruant one day vnto his cabinett to take thence ſome monie to pay the labourers, he retourned, anſwearing him that there was no more. He not beleeuing it, ſent him the ſecond time; but he affirmed that doubtleslie there was none; wherwith the gentleman conſidering the great expences he had made, and the failing of the foreſaid promiſe, being exceedinglie diſquieted: went impatientlie to the ſaid two Religious, and reproached them: wherto they humblie anſweared, that he should not not be afflicted: but ſhould goe himſelfe, and curiouslie ſearch, and ſhould without doubt finde the promiſe of God not to be fruſtrate. Which the gentleman hearing, being ſomewhat recomforted and encouraged, beleeued the wordes of the Religious. Goeing then himſelfe; he found all his monie, as if he had not disburſed a penie: and beſides he found a notable ſomme in a corner. Wherfore repleniſhed with ioy att the knowledge of ſuch a miracle of God, he wēt to the ſaid Religious, at whoſe feete falling proſtrate, he demaunded pardon for the litle faith he had: and then with exceding feruour proceeded in the building.
               
               
                  How S. Francis went into Egipt to preach the Faith of Ieſus Christ vnto the the Soldan.
                  THE LXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe yeare of grace 1219. after the ſaid holie Father had ſent his brethren into diuers places, as we haue ſaid, he determito goe preach the faith vnto the great Soldan of Babilon in Egipt, and with ſuch feruour, that the Chriſtians then went with exceeding deuotion, to ſee if he and his Religious could fight a ſpirituall combat, and by the grace of God, wreſt thoſe priſoners out of the

handes of the deuill. But as a great nomber of his Religious followed him to goe in his company, arriuing att Ancona, where they were to embarque themſelues, he ſaid vnto them: My beloued Brethren, I would willingly content you all. I know that you vehemently deſire to accompany me, in regard of your greedy thirſt of Martyrdome. But you may well perceaue that it is impoſsible, becauſe the veſſell is not capable to carry vs all: It is therfore expedient that you referre your ſelues to the will of God, wherby ſuch of you as ſhalbe elected, ſhall preſentlyHow S. Francis knew the will of God for carrying with him thoſe that accompanied him goeing to the Mores goe with me, and the others ſhall remayne in peace. And therfore that none be diſcontent, you ſee there a litle child very ſimple (which ſaying, he poynted att him, being before him) who knoweth vs not, if you thincke it good, as I doe, he ſhall make choice of you. They al incontinently conſented thervnto: the holy Father therfore called the child, to whome in theire preſence, he ſaid: Tell me, my child, is it the will of God that all theſe Religious goe with me into Egipt? The child anſweared, no. Which of them then (replyed S. Francis) This, this, this, (ſaid the child) and ſo by one and one he pointed out eleuen, and no more: which the others perceauing they ſtopped thir iorney, and the holy Father with the ſaid eleuen Religious embarqued themſelues.
                  At length after a longe nauigation they arriued in Egipt, where the Chriſtian army then beſeiged the citty of Damiett which the Soldan poſſeſſed, whoſe army was alſo in the feild, euery day ski

But the ſeruant of God S. Francis, who went thither for no other end but to die a martyr, hauing made his prayer, and being ſpiritually comforted in God, went with all his companyons to the army of the Mores, continually

Bur being diſcouered by the Mores, diuers of them iſſued out of the campe and aſſaulted S. Francis and his companions, as hungry wolues the ſimple ſheep, who yelded themſelues captiues without any reſiſtance, affirming only that they had matters of importance to impart vnto the Soldan.
               
               
                  
                  How the holy Father S. Francis preached vnto the Soldan
                  THE LXIX. CHAPTER.
                  THus then was S. Francis and his companions led faſt bound vnto the Soldan, who incontinently demaunded who they were, who had ſent them into his army, and what was the endA moſt vehement and perſuaſiue ſpeech &amp; exhortation of S. Francis vnto the Soldan. of their comming. The holy Father, as one that found himſelfe in that place which he had a long time exceedingly deſired, with a merueilous feruour of ſpiritt thus anſweared him: Know Emperour Soldan, that our comming hither hath not bin enioyned vs by any earthly man or Prince, but by the will and ordinance of that almighty king of kinges, and lord of lordes (the eternall God) who hath ſent vs vnto thee, that art not only his creature as we all are, but art alſo his Miniſter, and poſſeſſeſt his place in thine Empire: and therfore his moſt gracious goodnes ſeeing that thou with all thy people, walkeſt out of the true way of the knowledge of him, thine only, true, and ſoueraigne God: and though thou deceaueſt thy ſelfe putting thine affection in creatures, without acknowledging their Creatour and Redeemer: though thou doeſt farre ſtray from the way of naturall reaſon, wherby thou mighteſt attaine the knowledg of thy faultes, of the honour thou oweſt vnto his diuine Maieſty, and of his law, yet he, hauing a feeling compaſsion of thee, hath ſent vs hither to teach thee the true way, and the only meane of thy ſaluation, which conſiſteth alone in the faith and obediece of IESVS CHRIST, the true Sonne of God and true man, who came into the world to redeeme vs from the handes of the deuill, and to giue eternall glory to all them that haue bin, are, and ſhalbe ſincere in holy Faith: and on the contrary, eternall torment and damnation to the diſobedient, and ſuch as erre from the ſaid moſt holy Faith: and to this end would he, by his immenſiue charity aſſuming our nature, therwith ſatisfie all our offences, and die on the wood of the croſſe for our ſinnes, and would afterwardes leaue vs the meritt of his paſsion, in the ſacrament of holy baptiſme, wherby we are new borne to eternall life, that all our ſinnes dying, we may ſett our ſelues free from the captiuity of the deuill, and from eternall death, which this cruell ennemy hath from time to time procured vs. Great Soldan (proceeded the S.) open the eares and eyes of thine vnderſtanding: miſpriſe not the Embaſſadge which thine omnipotent eternall king ſendeth thee, permitt his grace to enter into thy hart, and by his holy light he will giue thee inſtant knowledg of the great blindes wherin till this day thou haſt liued: and conſider attentiuely how much thou art bound vnto his diuine maieſty, letting thee now vnderſtand that he can giue thee

a kingdome in heauen much greater then this which he hath giuen thee here one earth. But if thou perſeuer in thine errour, be thou aſſured ofThe effect of the holy Fathers ſpeech. the puniſhment prepared for thee: for thou muſt know that ſoone or late thou muſt fall into his handes, &amp; yeld him an account both of thy ſinnes, and of thy vaſſals. The holy Father ſpake theſe and many other▪ like wordes, with ſuch feruour and vehemencie of ſpiritt, that all thoſe preſent, though they were all infidels, did manifeſtlie know, that the ſaid wordes proceeded of a more then humane vertue. And they
                        Matt. 10. were indeed vttered with the ſame ſpiritt, that God promiſed his ſeruantes ſaying: I will giue you a tongue and wiſdome, which the princes of the world shall not be able to reſiſt.
                  
                  Now the Soldan acknowledgeing ſo great a vertue in the ſeruant of God, he gaue him thanckes with much reuerence, and tokens of curteſie, then asked him concerning new difficulties, being very attentiue to the anſweares which the holy Father gaue him, as a man ſent himS. F. hauing offered to put himſelfe into a fire with the preiſts of the Soldā for proof of his Religion, the high preiſt of the Soldan ran away. from God: and therfore very inſtantlie prayed him, not retourne to the Chriſtians, but to remaine with him: the ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST cntierly circumveſted with zeale of the faith, thervpon made him this anſweare.
                  Great Soldan, If you with all your people wilbe conuerted, I will right gladly remayne with you: and if you haue any doubt that detaineth you from leauing your beleefe for mine, becauſe the time is very ſhort, you may preſentlie make proofe therof: lett there be made a great fire in the middes of the army, then call your Sacrificers and Religious &amp; command vs all to enter into the middes of the fire: and afterwardes follow their faith that by their God shall be preſerued.
                  The Soldan, amazed att the propoſition made by the holy Father ſaid: I doe not thinck that any of our Religious will make this triall. Wherin he was not deceaued: for he had ſcarcely vttered that word, but one of his Collociers there preſent, very aged and among the Turcks reputed for a S. hearing it, incontinentlie slipt away, fearing that (the Soldan, accepting the condition) he ſhould be deuoured by the flames.
                  
                     S. F. for better affirmation of his faith offereth to goe into the fire. The holie Father then addreſsing himſelfe againe into the Soldan, ſaid: Mighty Soldan, wilt thou promiſe vnto God to become Chriſtian, if I my ſelfe alone goe into the fire? Wherto I am now readilie prepared. The Soldan anſweared him that he durſt not then make any ſuch promiſe, much leſſe accept ſuch offer, fearing that ſuch an vnwonted attēpt might raiſe ſome tumult in his army: neuertheles it wrought much fruit in his hart, and though for the preſent he did not reſolue to be baptiſed, yet he remayned exceedinglie aflected to the holy Father, to whome he offered a great quantity of gold, ſiluer, and apparell, for

himſelfe and his companions: which the Saint no more eſteemedS. F. refuſeth &amp; contemneth the preſents which the Soldan offered him. then verie filth, not vouchſafing to behold the ſame: which much more amazed the Soldan: yet he prayed him againe to accept thoſe preſents, to diſpoſe them in almoſe for his ſoule, albeit he were not as yet reſolued to be baptiſed. But his requeſtes were vaine. S. Francis then determined to paſſe further, as not finding any firme and ſtable reſolution in the Soldan, though he prayed the holy Father to viſitt him often, affirming that he would conferre more amply with him: &amp; graunted him letters patentes, by vertue wherof he &amp; his Br. might freely preach ouer all his kingdome, wherwith S. Francis departed.
               
               
                  How S. Francis and his companions preached the faith to the kingdome of the Soldan, and how he miraculously reſisted a More that tempted him to carnality.
                  THE LXX. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Francis diuided his companions and ſent them ouer Egipt &amp; Syria, and himſelfe with Brother Illuminatus went through all the kingdome continually preaching the goſpell. And being on a time enforced to reſt himſelfe in a certaine place expecting the mitigation of the ſtormy weather, he retired into a houſe to lodge, where in was a More, who in the lineamentes and proportion of her face was faire, and of comely grace, but in ſpiritt extremelie loath ſome: ſhe, induced by the deuill, that one each ſide caſt his ſnares to ſurpriſe the S. went to him into a chamber, where purpoſely ſhe had placed him alone, and inſtantlie prayed him to ſinne with her: the S. anſweared her: woman if thou wilt that I offend with thee, thou muſt alſo yeld to me in my requeſt.S. Franc. lyeth on the coales. Wherto the amourous More preſentlie accorded. S. Francis then incōtinently goeing to a great fire that was there, &amp; ſpreding it abroad, layed downe and ſtretched himſelfe theron, inuiting the More to keepe her promiſe, and lye with him one that bed ſo gorgious and reſplendat. The More remayned a while penſiue betweene loue and feare, expectingA lewd More thincking to tempte S. Fr. was cōuerted. the iſſue; but att length, ſeeing him to turne one the coales, as if he had bin one roſes and lillies; ſhe acknowledged her ſelfe, and her ſinne: and was baptiſed, and afterwards (by vertue of the miracle of the S.) as an other Samaritane, conuerted many Mores vnto IESVS CHRIST. The S. hauing vpon this occaſion ſeiourned there certaine dayes, went on his iorney, &amp; cōming within three or four leagues of Antioch, to a place called Mōtenegro, where was a Monaſtery of Religious of the Order S. Be. he there made ſome ſtay &amp; in ſuch ſort cōported him ſelfe, that in few dayes the Abbott &amp; all the Religious renūcing

                     A whole monastery of Benedictines became of S. Franc. Order. all their poſſeſiōs into the hādes of the Patriarck became Freer Minors:
                  In the meane while it chaunced vnto two other of his companions that they ſeeming to a More, ſo miſerable, he of compaſsion offered them almoſe, which they refuſing in any ſort to receaue, the More demaunded them wherfore they would not accept the ſame, wherto they anſweared, that for the Ioue of God they would poſſeſſe neither mony, or any other thing in this world: the More was therwith ſo touched, that he ſodenly receaued them into his affection, yea into ſuch amity, that thence forward he had care of all their neceſsities, and promiſed them to ſell his goodes to mayntaine them, if they would continue in that country. The worthy example of their life was ſo admirable, that they who could not be conuerted by their doctrine, were conuerted by meane of their vertuous worckes, which indeed are of much more efficacie: they mollified the moſt fierce and barbarous nations, mortall ennemies of the Chriſtian name, making them compaſsionate and pittifull, but the nomber of the wicked and inſolent budding foorth, and being the more potent in that country, yet not daring to kill them, in regard of the patentes of their great Soldan; they cauſed them to liue aS. Franc. retourned towardes the Soldan. lamentable life, afflicting them ten thouſand manner of wayes: and the holy Father here vpon knowing the will of God to be that he ſhould retourne, hauing by the aſsiſtance of his diuine Maieſty, aſſembled al his Religious, not hauing ſo much profited among thoſe Barbarians, as he deſired, he repayred towardes the Soldan, thence (hauing taken leaue of him)to retourne into Italy.
               
               
                  How S. Francis retourned into Italy.
                  THE LXXI. CHAPTER.
                  THe ſaid holy Father being retourned towardes the Soldan, was very ioyfully and graciously entertayned, and he att length told him ſecretly that he would willingly become Chriſtian, beleeuingThe reſolution of the Soldan to become Chriſtiā and his demaund to be inſtructed. firmely that the Chriſtian Religion was the true way of ſaluation; but he feared to manifeſt the ſame for the preſent, the time ſeeming improper, he warring againſt the Chriſtians, nor being ſecure, by reaſon that the Mores hated them to the death: but becauſe by thy retourne (ſaid the Soldan to S. Francis) as I cōiecture, thou mayeſt profitt many, and I haue many matters to diſpatch that deeply concerne me: I beſeech thee to inſtruct me att this preſet, that mine affaires effected, I may obey thee, when occaſiō ſhalbe preſēted, as I doe now ſincerely promiſe thee. The holy Father hauing demaunded reſpite of anſweare, went to his prayer, wherin perſeuering for many dayes together, he continually implored the grace of God for that poore ſoule, whence he would neuer

deſiſt, till he was heard, which with the ſucceſſe being reuealed vnto him, he wēt to the Soldā, to whom he ſaid: Sir, I reſolue to goe into Italy, the will of my God being ſuch: but I promiſe to ſēd you two Religious, in time conuenient, by whoſe meane (according to the reuelationS. Franc. aſsureth the Soldan of his ſaluation. which God hath giuen me, and which I explicate and promiſe vnto you) you ſhall certainely be ſaued. The Soldan, hauing heard ſo gratefull an anſweare, with an exceeding contentement imprinted the ſame in his hart, and S. Francis taking leaue of him retourned into Italy, and failed not in the accompliſhment of his promiſe: for he appeared to two of his Religious that were reſident in Syria, whom he ſent to the Soldan who was deadly ſick: the Religious repayred vnto him and inſtructed him,And sēt him two of his Religious to baptiſe him a litle before his death. and hauing baptiſed him he died.
                  S. Antony of Padua ſpeaking of this Soldan, conformably hereto affirmeth, that diuers are of opiniō that he was baptiſed before his death: the firme affectiō which he carryed vnto the Chriſtiās, being apparantly manifeſted: for he had entertayned of thē for the guard of his body: &amp; it is well knowne what piety he alwayes ſhewed towardes our army. Likwiſe Iames de Vitry Cardinall, in his hiſtorie writtē of the conqueſt of the holie land, guieth teſtimonie of S. Francis his voyage in thoſe quarters, in theſe wordes: We haue ſeene the Father S. Francis, the firſt Founder of the Order of the Freer Minors, a ſimple man and without learning,Iames de Vitri Cardinal. but ſo much fauoured of God and men, and eleuated to ſo high a feruour of ſpiritt, that cōming to the armie of Chriſtiās, that beſeiged the cittie of Damiette in Egipt, he paſſed with out any feare, armed onlie with the buckler of faith, to the middeſt of the armie of the Mores, ſaying: Bring me to the Soldan: to whoſe preſence being come, as ſoone as he had beheld him, of a moſt cruell beaſt as he was, he became a moſt gentle lambe, and gaue moſt attentiue eare to the word of God which he preached. But att length fearing that many of his people that deſirously herad him, and yet did not ſtirre from his campe, would be conuerted and adhere vnto our army; he returned him with great reuerence vnto vs, praying him att his deperture that he would pray vnto God for him, that he would pleaſe to inſpire him to entertaine and eſpouſe that law, that were moſt pleaſing and gratefull vnto him.
               
               
                  Of the vehement temptations wherwith the deuils tormented S. Francis.
                  THE LXXII. CHAPTER.
                  ALbeit the holy Father wrought ſo much fruit, conuerting the ſinners of Egipt, and conducting them into the true land of promiſe, which is Religion free from all earthly tribute and obligation: neuertheles the ancient ennemy of this bleſſed generation

did not sleep: for he vſed all the slightes he could deuiſe wherwith to confound the ſame. And becauſe he knew well that it entierly conſiſted in the head which was S. Francis, he omitted not to aſſault this fortreſſe, which God had placed on an high ſcituation to be an example vnto others, hoping alwayes either to weary him, or att leaſt to make ſome relent and mitigation of his ſtrict rigour and perfection of life. Knowing therfore that all kind of vertue was compleat in the ſaid S. he alſo ſtirred all his miniſters againſt him, who notwithſtanding could no further preuaile then God would permitt. The arrogant and proud Lucifer, could not ſupport his profound humilitie. Mammon the prince of the world perceauing that there was no wordlie thing in the S. but that he had caſsiered euery thing, yea him who was prince thereof, by the rigour of Euangelicall pouertie, he neuer slept from endeauouring to make him caſt his affection on ſome creature of this world. The gloutonus Satan watched and laboured to procure ſome relaxation in the rigour of his diett, lodging, and cloathing. The impatient Aſmodeus armed himſelfe againſt him to leuell att the patience of the holie Father. The loathſome and filthy Behemol aſſaulted him, preſenting ſenſualitie, often vnto him, with endeauour to defile the candour of his virginitie. Belzebub the captaine of the idle, omitted no time to tempt him with sloath, and by ſome apparant reaſons, to perſuade him to take ſome litle recreation: The perſecuting prince Leuiathan, tormented him with naturall perturbations, diſcontentements, and diſguſtes, wherwith the fleſh afflicted the peace and charitie of the S. againſt which Golias and his army, the humble Dauid in the name and vertue of his God, obtayned ſo glorious a victorie, that he might well ſing: Francis hath ruined and ſubdued an hundred thouſand ennemies, and hath driuen away the deriſions and rebukes which the diuels procured vnto the Church by auarice and ſenſualitie. But God would that the deuill himſelfe ſhould by the mouth of the poſſeſſed, acknowledge the cruell warre that S. Francis and his Religious waged againſt him, and likwiſe the great fruit they produced in ſoules, though this his confeſsion was ſufficientlie knowne and experienced by the world, and reuealed by IESVS CHRIST, himſelfe: wherfore the S. merited to be crowned, hauing bin ſo valiant in the fierce aſſaultes of ſo many ennemies, and att length vanquiſhed ſo tedious a combatt as he had from the beginning of his conuerſion: Firſt by his very parentes, and afterward by infinite other meanes, that neuer permitted him in repoſe. But how much more the deuill gaue him occaſion to ſinne, ſo much more did he endeauour to meritt, and became pure as gold in the fire. Wherfore

he often ſaid: If my Religious knew what warre mine ennemies raiſe againſt me, they would perhappes haue compaſsion of me, and hold me excuſed, if I cannot be ſometimes with them, as I would deſire.
                  One time when God permitted him for his greater good to be tempted, the deuill drawe him into ſo deepe a melancholy of ſpiritt, that exteriourly there appeared many ſignes therof, he being no longer able to conceale nor moderate the ſame, in ſuch ſort as he ſeemed to beS. Franc. had a tēptation of Melā

                      vtterlie abandoned of God. If he would conuerſe with his Religious, he could not, if he would be ſequeſtred from them, it was worſe, abſtinence and mortification of the fleſh annoyed him, haircloth and prayer auayled not. He continued in this ſort more then two yeares, though one would not haue imagined it had bin of an houres continuance, till att length God determining to haue compaſsion of him, as he prayed with effuſion of teares, he heard the voice of God that ſaid: If thou haſt (ſo much) faith as a muſtard ſeed, and ſayeſt to this mountaine, remoue from hence thither, it ſhalbe done. S. Francis then anſweared, which is this mountaine, my God? and the voice replyed: The temptation: then S. Francis: My God, lett thy word then be accompliſhed. And from thence he was freed, and gaue infinite thanckes to God for the ſame.
               
               
                  Of many other temptations with S. Francis had.
                  THE LXXIII. CHAPTER.
                  SAint Francis being in continuall prayer in the hermitage of Grecio, a gentleman one night ſending him a pillow to vſe in regard of the infirmity of his eyes: he could neuer repoſe nor pray: for he had ſuch a trembling in his head, that all his body was diſtempered therwith. Now hauing a long time diſcourſed with himſelfe, whence this diſtemperature ſhould proceed, he att length reſolued and concluded, that it could not be occaſioned but by the pillow, wherinto the deuill was entred: wherfore he cauſed it to be carryed outThe deuil entred into a pillow lent vnto S. Franc. for his infirmity of his cell by his companion: who hauing to that purpoſe layed it on his ſhoulders and carryed it out, incontinentlie loſt his ſpeech, and which was yet worſe) ſtood immoueable with the ſaid pillow, He continued in this affliction, which how it tormented him may of each one be imagined, till ſainct Francis admiring his long tariance, called him: att which voice the Religious retourned to himſelfe, caſt the pillow inſtantlie to the ground, and ran to the S. to whome he recounted all, whervpon he anſweared him:

My Brother, laſt night whiles I was att compline, I vnderſtood that this deuill came hither: and know that finding no other place, he entred into the ſoft pillow: learne therfore now how ſubtill and malicious he is, that hauing no power to endommage the ſoule, becauſe it is protected by diuine grace, he ſeeketh to hinder the repoſe of the body, that it may not pray, and performe other exerciſes in time conuenient; or to make it diſeaſed to procure it to murmure, and therby to fall into ſinne.
                  Being an other time afflicted with the ſaid infirmitie of his eyes, in ſuch ſort as for the ſpace of fifty dayes together, he could ſee no light, he was placed in a very darck cell made of ruſhes, mattes, and earth: there did he endure ſuch exceſsiue greife, as he could not haue one hower of repoſe. The deuill to augment his affliction, ſent him into his celle a very great quantity of huge mice, that they might prouoke him to impatience: wherfore the S. being entierly reſigned into the handes of God, feeling a vehement anguiſh in his hart, vttered theſe worde

                      Help me, my God, in ſuch a multitude of infirmities, diſeaſes, and afflictions: that I may patiently endure them. Whereto a voice anſweared: Tell me, S. Francis, if for thyne infirmities and afflictions, one ſhouldHow S. Francis was aſſured of his ſaluation. promiſe thee ſuch a treaſure, and of ſo great valew, as if all the earth were gold, and all the ſtones diamondes, or other precious ſtones, and all the waters baulme, wouldeſt thou not eſteeme all thy miſeries, filthy dirt, in compariſon of the ſaid treaſure, and wouldeſt thou not be content more then voluntarily to ſupporte the ſame? herevnto the S. anſweared, yea, I ſhould be very glad therof. Well reioyce thee then (replyed the voice) that thou mayeſt liue content and ſecure, as if thou wert in my kingdome. Hauing concluded his prayer, with exceeding ioy of this viſion, deliuerance &amp; diuine promiſe, he incontinently ſaid to his companions: If a king had giuen a kingdome to a ſeruaunt, ſhould not he haue cauſe to be alwayes ioyfull? And they anſweared, yes. And if (added he) he gaue him all the Empires of the world, ſhould he not haue yet greater cauſe of ioy? they likewiſe anſweared, yes. I ought then ſaid he, infinitely to reioyce in mine infirmities and greifes, and for them to giue thanckes vnto the Father of mercie, vnto my Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, &amp; to the holy Ghoſt the true comforter: ſith he hath ſhewed ſuch mercie to me his vnworthy ſeruant, as to vouchſafe att this preſent to aſſure me of his kingdome. In reſpect wherof I will compoſe himnes, to ſinghenceforward, and to yeld him infinite thankes for the ſame.

                  THE LXXIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe deuils, not content to diſturbe him with infinite temptations did alſo aſſault him by occaſion of ſinne, as by the enſuyng accident ſhall appeare. Preaching one day in Apulia, in a church very neere vnto the Pallace of the Emperour Frederick, being as yet vnknowne, many Courtiers were there preſent, who perceauing him ſo freelie to reprehend vices, affirming that whoſoeuer would follow and ſatisfie his ſenſuall appetites, could neuer haue part in heauen, they retourning, did ſcoffingly relate the whole vnto the Emperour, who anſweared them. Theſe Preachers in deed do ſay much, but they performe litle. Wherfore I would willingly know if this mā be ſuch a one, lett ſome one amongeſt you vndertake to inuite him to ſupper &amp; lodge with him, and hauing giuen him good entertainement, let him dexterouslyA gentilman hauing promiſed the Emperour Frederick the ſecōd to induce S. Franc. to ſinne with a woman, did repēt the ſame and the Emperour alſo. conuey into his chamber a faire courtiſane, to try if he can vſe that vertue of continence which he ſo forcibly preacheth vnto vs. A gentleman did preſentlie offer to putt this proiect in practiſe, for in princes Courtes there want not men that ſeeke, rather to pleaſe their maſter in theſe friuolous and ſottiſh toyes, then in matters that concerne the honnour and ſaffety of the ſoule. This Courtier then, when he had found a time conuenient to the purpoſe, inuited the holy Father, who ſimply promiſed him, his cuſtome being ordinarily to ſatiſfie honeſt and lawfull requeſtes. He then went with the ſaid gentleman vnto his houſe, which he found ſumptuously adorned, and being ſett at table, did according to his cuſtome eat very litle: after that, att conuenient houre he was brought to a chamber all tapiſtred, where was a right gorgious bed, and a great fire conformable to the coldnes of the ſeaſon: the gentleman bidding him good night, wiſhed him to sleepe att his eaſe: but the holy Father anſweared him, that this chamber and bed were not proper for a poore begger as himſelfe was, for whome the bare ground, or a litle chaffe would ſuffice: but the gentleman departed without giuing any reply, and ſubtilly left the chamber dore open; wherby he brought in a verie beautifull damoſell, yong, and wittie, and a corrupted Courteſane, to whome he promiſed great matters, if ſhe could induce this Religious to ſinne with her.
                  She then permitting him to end his prayers, and to couer himſelfe att his commoditie, the time ſeeming to her purpoſe, went to his bed

ſide: the S. ſeeing her on the ſodaine, asked her to what end ſhe came thither: wherto ſhe anſweared: that ſhe came priuarely▪ to lye with him, and that ſhe would neuer leaue him till he conſented to her deſire. S. Francis herevpon rayſing himſelfe, ſaid: ſith thou art therto reſolued, be it: but ſtay a litle, I will prepate our lodging. And hauing with a couragious hart made a ſhort prayer vnto God, he, with the irons that he found one the harth, ſpread and ſcattered the moſt burning coales that were in the fire, and laid himſelfe theron, without receauing any detriment, then inuited the Courtiſane, as he had done the More in Egipt. Which the woman ſeeing, though ſhe were ſinfull, began to cry out that ſhe had greiuously offended God, and his ſeruaunt: and falling one her knees demaunded pardon of him. Wherfore they that attended on the ſtears without the dore to ſee the ſucceſſe of their lewd deſigne, confounded and filled with feare and terrour, repenting their peruerſe Counſaile did alſo aske pardon, and relating all to the Emperour, himſelfe ſending for the S. did likewiſe craue his pardon, and requeſted him to be mindfull of him and his in his deuotions: thus in one inſtant he ſubdued the pleaſure of the fleſh that was lewdly offered him by the woman, and the deuill that had plotted the ſame, remained conquered, and the Emperour and his Courtiers clearly aſſured that the S. his life was conformable to his wordes, and finally God was prayſed.
               
               
                  Of the great aſsaults that the deuils gaue S. Francis in ſolitary places.
                  THE LXXV. CHAPTER.
                  THeſe afflictions which the holy Father endured were doubtles very violent: but thoſe which the deuils laid on him in ſolitarie places, where he prayed, were without compariſon much greater: for they gaue him a meruailous warre, often appearing vnto him in hideous and loathſome ſhapes, yea ſo horrible, that no humane creature had bin able to endure them, if God had not giuen him forceS. Francis confounded the deuils whenſoeuer they aſsaulted him. and aſsiſtance, and theſe monſters did ſometimes appeare vnto him with ſuch importunity, that they ſeemed to intend a combattt with him. Brother Giles that was alſo exceedingly moleſted by the deuils, did one day demaund of S. Francis if he had ſeene in the world that, which could not be beheld by any whoſoeuer the ſpace of a Pater noſter, who anſweared that the deuill was ſo loathſome and horrible that no man without the help of God, could behold him the ſpace only of halfe a Pater noſter. Notwith ſtanding armed with celeſtial armure,

the more they aſſaulted him, the more courage and vallour did he gett, ſaying: I will defend me, My God, from the fury of theſe wicked ſpirittes, vnder the ſhadow of thy winges and of thy graces. Sometimes, euen being in the deſert, he vrged them by theſe wordes. Ye falſe and wicked ſpirittes make boldly what anatomie of me you will, for ſure I am you ſhall doe no more then my God will permitt you, whoſe creature I am, and for whome I am ready to endure as much tribulation as he will giue me, by your meane. The deuils no longer able to endure this notable conſtancie, departed vtterly confounded.
                  S. Francis remayning one day in a Churche of S. Peter, neere to Bolonia, deſired to repoſe awhile, to make his prayer afterward. He had ſcarcely enclined his head, but he began to feele his ennemies, wherfore making the ſigne of the croſſe, he went out of the Church and ſaid vnto them: yee deuils I coniure you in the name of God the Father almighty, that to this my body you doe what ſoeuer my God hath permitted you: for I am prepared to endure althinges for his loue, and becauſe I haue no greater ennemie then my body, reuenge me one it: which hauing ſaid, they fled vtterlie confounded.

                  How S. Francis deliuered his Brethren from temptations.
                  THE LXXVI. CHAPTER.
                  THus did S. Francis by the helpe of God obtaine ſo many victories ouer his ennemies, whereby he had already ſo terrified them, that he expelled them only by vertue of his name, when he knew it to be to the honour of God. Beſides this auctority which God had giuen him, he had alſo ſuch experience by reaſon of the continuall combattes which he had with them, that he knew how to counſaile, comfort and applie remedies to his Religious, when they ſuffered affliction in that kinde, as the ſequel of this diſcourſe will giue vs to vnderſtand.
                  A very ſpirituall Religious and one of the moſt auncient of the Order, very familiar with S. Francis being afflicted with carnall temptations, by extrauagant imaginations, in ſuch ſort as he was

almoſt reduced to a deſperate point of power to reſiſt them any longer, and one the other ſide he was exceedingly perplexed to cōfeſſe himſelfe therof, ſo much was ſhame to expreſſe ſuch foule and filthy cogitations, now encreaſed in him: faſtinges, abſtinences, and prayers, or other ſpirituall worckes did profitt him nothing: Neuertheles reſiſting alwayes to his vttmoſt, God ſent vnto him his ſeruant S. Francis, who comming to the monaſterie where this poore Religious was, he priuatelyS. Franc. in ſpiritt knew the temptations of his Religious. called him and ſaid: Beloued brother, I will not that henceforward you confeſſe ſuch and ſuch fantaſies, wherwith the deuill to this day could neuer preuaile againſt you, and therefore hereafter feare not, but as often as he ſhall tempt you, ſay only thrice the Pater noster, and by the mercie of God you ſhalbe deliuered. The Religious exceedingly amazed att the vertue of S. Francis that knew his very cogitations, was very contētedly ſatisfied with ſo ſweet and gentle a medicine, wherof making vſe, he freed himſelfe of the temptations.
                  Brother Roger de la Marque, a Religious of pious conuerſation, was by diuine permiſsiō, ſo tempted of the deuils, that he eſteemed himſelfe forſaken of God: and becauſe no application did auaile him, he reſolued to vſe this laſt refuge: I will, ſaid he goe ſeeke out S. Francis, of whome if I be mildly and with a gracious countenance entertayned, I ſhall haue hope of Goddes mercy: but if he looke awry vpon me, I will take it for a ſigne that God hath forſaken me. Hauing thus determined, he tooke his way towardes the holy Father, who was att Aſsiſium in the Biſhops houſe who then was ſick, where he had reuelation of all this, wherfore he commanded Brother Leo and Brother Macie to goe meet him and to tell him in his name; that he loued him particulerly aboue all other of his Religion: which the ſaid Religious vnderſtanding, full of conſolation, he fell on his knees with the interiour of his hart giuing thanckes to God, for that he neuer abandoneth his ſeruantes, but doth euer giue eare to the prayers of thoſe that hope in him: and giueth them the helpe of his grace to perſeuer in his ſeruice. Which done, he aroſe, and with them went to the holy Father, who knowing their comming, aroſe from the bed where he lay, and comming to him, very tenderly embraced him, &amp; left him not till he was entierly conforted, and then diſmiſſed him, fully ſatisfied and freed of his temptation.
                  Brother Angelus was alſo ſo greiuously tempted that he durſt not be alone in the night, for feare of the deuils: but S. Francis hauing made the ſigne of the croſſe vpon him, enioyned him to goe vp on an high mountaine and with a loud voice to ſay vnto them: O yee proud deuils, come ye all and doe that vnto me which God hath permitted: which hauing done he neuer after ſaw any thing that did offend him.
               
               
                  
                  How S. Francis gaue aſsistance to certaine of his Brethren that were far from him.
                  THE LXXVII. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Francis hauing his children alwayes in his hart and in his ſoule, he merited that as he prayed for them, God did often reueale vnto him the neceſsities wherinto they were fallen, to the end that by his preſence, or ſending vnto them, or prayers, he might releiue them. His Vicar one a time holding a chapter, he ſaw in ſpiritt a Religious that would not acknowledge his fault, to doe penance for it, but did with all poſsible reaſons defend himſelfe. S. Francis called a Religious and ſaid vnto him: Brother, behold how the deuill ſitteth one the ſhoulders of that poore Religious and holdeth him by the throte halfeS. Franc. aſsisted a Religious whome the deuil choaked. choaked, becauſe I haue prayed to God for him, and he hath heard me, goe and bid him humble himſelfe to his Vicar, and tell him the deuill henceforward ſhall haue no power of him. Which the Religious hauing done, the other full of contrition fell at the feet of the Vicar, acknowledged his fault, did penance, and merited thenceforward to liue very piously.
                  
                     Brother Leo was deliuered from a temptatiō by a letter from S. Franc. Brother Leo being exceedingly oppreſſed &amp; afflicted by diuers temptations of the deuill S. Francis ſent him a letter ſuch as the ſaid Brother Leo then deſired, who att the very inſtant that he had read it, was deliuered: the contentes wherof were thus: God hold and bleſſe &amp; tourne his face to thee, God be mercifull to thee, and giue thee his peace, Brother Leo, God giue thee his benediction, So be it. The which wordes taken out of the booke of Numbers of the benedictions of God, were of ſuch efficacy, that they deliuered all thoſe from temptations to whome the S. in writing ſent them.
                  God permitted S. Francis, being one day att our Lady of Angels, to ſee a great multitude of deuils that endeauoured to enter there, which they could not doe till a Religious began to conceaue hatred againſtS. Franc. knew in ſpirit the vices and defects of his Religious. one of his Brethren, which did ſo breed in his hart that they entred into his body and poſſeſſed him: which S. Francis perceauing (as a pittifull Paſtour of his ſheep, called the Religious and reprehended him for the hatred he boare to his brother: wherat he being exceedingly amazed that S. Francis knew it, did acknowledge the vertue that God gaue him, and put away that hatred, and thus was conſequentlie freed of his ennemy.
               
               
                  
                  How he deliuered Brother Ruffinus from a vehement temptation.
                  THE LXXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Ruffinus the companion of S: Francis was one time ſo extremely and cruelly tempted, with a temptation of diffidence of predeſtination, that I doubt whither there could be a greater, whence may be collected what slightes the deuill doth vſe, to ſeeke the ruine of the moſt perfect, if God did not exceedingly aſsiſt them. Brother Ruffinus was a Religious of a pious and holy conuerſation, and of very deepe contemplation; wherfore the deuill hauing tēpted him with diffidence of predeſtination, made it ſeeme vnto him that all the labours, troubles and afflictions which he endured were loſt, with the time which he vnprofitably ſpent in Religion, by reaſon that he was not predeſtinate vnto glory: which temptation augmenting, though he omitted not to conuerſe with his Brethren, did neuertheles make him exceeding ſorrowfull. And becauſe he was fearfull and aſhamed to diſcouer it to any one, the deuill by diuine permiſsion did tempt him more and more. Wherfore aſſaulting him both exteriourly and interiourly, he one time appeared vnto him in forme of a crucifix, that ſeeming to haue compaſsion on him, ſaid: Poore man why doeſt thou afflict thee with ſo many abſtinences without fruit? what auaile thee ſo many prayers? ſith all the world together cannot chaunge that which from all eternity hath bin ordayned by the prouidence of my Father: wherby thou art not of the nomber of the predeſtinate, but of the reprobate. Wherfore I am moued with compaſsion of thy ſo great ſufferance: that att leaſt thou begin not they hell during they life, and albeit I haue already diuers time inſpited thee interiourly: I am now content to appeare vnto thee ſuch as I am, and by mine ordinary clemencie to aſſure thee of that which onlie I doe know, ſith onlie I doe damne and ſaue, which I doe to putt thee out of all doubt, and to the end thou no longer beleeue that other damned alſo, that ſonne of Bernardone, who ſhall goe to hell with his Father, and all they that follow him ſhalbe deceaued. And after theſe wordes he vaniſhed, leauing the poore Brother Ruffinus in ſuch heauines (a miſerie that doth proſtrate and ouetthrow the greateſt ſeruants of God) and in his ſpiritt ſo ſhadowed by the great princes of darcknes, that he was euen ready to looſe the faith he had in God and in his holy ſeruant:

to whome notwithſtanding the aforeſaid, he imparted nothing of his affliction.
                  
                     S. Franc. deliuered B. Ruffinus of a moſt greiuous tēptation diſcouering vnto him the deluſion of the deuill. But the holie Father being by diuine reuelation aduertiſed therof, and ſeeing the perill wherinto his ſo deerly beloued brother was fallen, he ſent for him by Brother Macie as farre as the mount Subaſio, where he remayned in a celle ſeparated from other: to whome, hauing vnderſtood the meſſage, he rudely anſweared: That he had nothing to doe with S. Francis: by which wordes Brother Macie eſteeming that he might be deluded by the deuill, amiably replyed ſaying. Oh God, brother Ruffinus what wordes haue you vttered? are you beſides you ſelfe? or doe you yeeld to be deluded by the deuill? Know you not that S. Francis is an Angel of heauen on earth? Is it not knowne vnto vs how many millions of ſoules God hath ſaued &amp; will ſaue by his meanes: how he hath illuminated the world, and how much ourſelues perticulerly are by him illuminated? howſoeuer ſith he hath expresly ſent for you, I will that you repaire vnto him, becauſe indeed I know that you are exceedingly deluded by the deuill.
                  Brother Ruffinus being by theſe wordes att length perſuaded, without farther reply went with him, and came to S. Francis: in whoſe preſence appearing, the deuill loſt his prey. For after he had recounted vnto the S. all the circonſtances of his temptation by order, and had receaued demonſtrations of the S. to witt that the deuill did harden the hearts of men, and God on the contrary did ſoften and mollifie thē,
                        Ezechia 39. himſelfe ſaying: I will take from thee thy heart of ſtone, and will giue thee one of fleſh, acknowledgeing the extreme hardnes which the deuill had left in his heart, and with all vnderſtanding in one inſtant all his slightes, with abondance of teares he vttered his fault and cō
                     feſſed his ſinne in concealing his temptation S. Francis then ſaid vnto him: My ſonne, goe make thy confeſsion frequent prayer, and know for certaine that this tēptation, as thou ſhalt breifely experience, ſhall tourne to no leſſe peace and ſpirituall ioy. And if this horrible deuill retourne to tempt thee, vſe theſe wordes vnto him: Thou baſe and loathſome deuill, open wide thy lying mouth, that I may fill it full of filth. Thus Brother Ruffinus retourning to his ſaid mountaine and celle there to lament his paſſed errour, Satan preſented himſelfe vnto him in forme of IESVS CHRIST crucified, and ſaid did I not forbid thee to beleeue Brother Francis? But brother Ruffinus intertupted his wordes, and anſweared: Thou loathſome and lying deuill, open that thy mouth, where out iſſue ſuch horrible lyes, that I may fill it with vilany: which the falſe and proud deceauer hearing departed, making ſuch a terrible ruine of the ſtones of the montaine which he threw downe by groſſe heapes hurling thē with ſuch impetuoſity, that the ſtones &amp; flintes

tumbling downe ſtroake fire againſt each other: breifely it ſeemed that the mountaine was entierly to be ouer-throwen or ſuncken.
                  This ſtorme was heard euen to the place where S. Francis was, who with his companions went out to ſee whence proceeded this terrible noyſe. They were all exceedingly terrified, S. Francis excepted, who incontinently imagined the cauſe. In the meane while Brother Ruffinus returned victorious from ſo tedious &amp; bitter a combatt, who by experience knowing this illuſion, came to S. Francis to whome to the great ioy and contentement of all the hearers he recounted all the ſucceſſe. He being retourned to his cell, the true Cruciſix incontinentlie appeared vnto him, and ſaid: Thou haſt done well, Brother Ruffinus, to take the counſaile of Francis, who hath diſcouered vnto thee th
                        •
                      fraud of the deuill: and therfore henceforward, in conſideration of the affliction which thou haſt endured in this temptation, I giue thee this grace that whiles thou liueſt, thou ſhalt be no more afflicted by the deuill: then bleſsing him he diſappeared: whervpon he was according to the propheſie of the holy Father ſo comforted, and repleniſhed with ſuch ſweetnes and feruour of ſpiritt, that his ſoule was often rauiſhed and eleuated in God: and ſo he liued and died in this perfect vnion of his loue.
               
               
                  Of the humility that shined in this Saint.
                  THE LXXIX. CHAPTER.
                  IT being vnderſtood, that the holy Father had obtayned a right glorious victory ouer the deuill, in himſelfe and his: for he only is vanquiſhed that preſumeth of himſelfe, and the humble (as litle fiſhes) eſcape out of the nettes, we will now conſider by what meane the S. became ſo admirably victorious ouer thoſe proud and rebellious ſpirittes. It was in deed by no other meane then by his humility, wherwith he did not only ſurmount their cruell aſſaultes, but they being vnable long time to endure him, he putt them to flight; it alone being the guard, beauty, and the mother of all other vertues, aboue all which, it ſhined in him &amp; gaue light as in the perſō of him that would be the leaſt of all his brethren, and one that freely acknowledged himſelfe the greateſt ſinner of ſinners, and reputed himſelfe no other then a veſlell full of ordure: and not (as in deed he was) an elected veſſell, full of ſanctity and very reſplendant, by the luſtre of ſo great vertues and ſinguler graces, wherin all perfection appeared as in a very beautifull &amp; cleare glaſſe. Now on this vertue of humility, he laboured to found and build all his holy and worthy edifice, affirming that IESVS CHRIST

deſcended not into the world, from the beſome of his eternall Father, nor was veſted with our ſo contemptible fleſh for other end but (hauing redeemed vs) to teach vs both by word and effect as a true maſter of humility, what himſelfe ſaid: Learne of me becauſe I am meeke and
                        Matt. 11. humble of hart: therfore he as his imitatour endeauoured to be of no reſpect, firſt in his owne ſight, and then before others, fearing leaſt it ſhould befall vnto him as it is writtē, that he which is high before men,
                        Luc. 16. is abominable before God; for which cauſe he accuſtomed to ſay vnto his Religious: A man is ſo great as he appeareth to be before God, and no greater: and therfore it is a great vanity to glory in the honours of the world. He alſo reioyced when any iniury or reproch was done him, and receaued prayſes and honoures diſcontentedly, being better pleaſed with reprehenſion then with flattery: becauſe ſaid he, by reprehenſion he learned to humble and correct himſelfe, wheras it was an ouer exceſsiue vanity to heare ones ſelfe prayſed. And with all he endeauoured to conceale the giftes which he receaued of God, forbearing to diſcouer that which might occaſion him to fall or offend.
                  Being one day called S. call me no more S. ſaid he, for as yet I may haue children, and no man ought to be prayſed, till he haue perſeuered vnto the end, which to vs is vncertaine; beſides, no glory is to be giuen to what ſoeuer is done by a ſinner: A ſinner may faſt, lament, and diſcipline his fleſh, but he cannot doe it alone and of himſelfe. The principall is that he be faithfull vnto his God, wherof only he ſhould glorifie: which he ſhall doe, if in his ſeruitude, he attribute all the good he ſhall doe, vnto God, from whome doe proceed and are deriued vnto vs, all graces and perfections, as from the true Father of all our conſolations.
               
               
                  Of the loue and zeale he had in humility.
                  THE LXXX. CHAPTER.
                  DIſcourſing one day with his brethren, he ſaid: I cannot repute my ſelfe a Freer Minor, If I proue not this that followeth in my ſelfe: I purpoſe to goe to the chapiter, where ſhalbe aſſembledSpiritual mortifications of S. Fr. all the Religious who will receaue me with great reuerence as their ſuperiour: afterward, lett them pray me to comfort them, explicating vnto them the word of God, which for their ſatisfaction performing, lett them all ariſe and ſay: Hold they peace, we well haue thee no longer for Superiour, for thou art an idiot, block-head, and ignorant: and with all knoweſt not what thou ſayeſt, wherfore it is ouer great ſhame to haue ſuch a ſuperiour; then be it that you detrude me out of the

chapter with vtter diſhonour, as deſeruing the ſame: I would not (I ſay) eſteeme me a good Freer Minor, if I did not ſupport all that with the ſame promptitude and ioy, as if I heard my ſelfe prayſed: for if I reioyce att honours, what profitt reape I therby? I putt my ſoule in perill of vaine glory without hope of any benefitt: but if I be contemned, my ſoule is therby ſecured and profiteth in ſpiritt. In regard of his exceedingly zeale vnto this humility, when it happened that any prayſed him, either for his preaching, or vpon any other occaſion, he commanded his companion, to contrary it, and to giue him wordes of diſprayſe: which doeing, though vnwillingly, the holy Father would anſweare; God bleſſe you, becauſe you ſpeake the truth, and that which the ſonne of Peter Bernardone doth deſerue.
                  Being one day att out lady of Angels, Brother Macie had a deſire to trie the humility of S. Francis, though he were his perticuler freind, only becauſe he knew it would be gratefull vnto him: Being then in his preſence, he twice iterated theſe wordes: Wherfore to you? wherfore to you? as if he would inferre: Francis, wherefore doe people ſo much honour you? The holie Father ſmilinglie anſweared: What meane you byProofe of the humility of S. Fr. that brother Macie? All the world (replyed brother Macie) runneth after you, euery one deſireth to ſee you, to heare and obey you: and for any thing that I know, you are neither perſonable, learned, eloquent, nor noble, whence is it then the world doth follow you? The S. then veſted with his accuſtomed humilitie, hauing lifted his eyes to heauen, and a litle prayed and thanked God, thus anſweared his deere freind: Will you know, Brother Macie, whence it proceedeth that, as you ſay, ſuch reſort of people doe follow me and willinglie heare me? This proceedeth of the eyes of the great omnipotent God which in all places beholding both the good and bad, hath pleaſed to chooſe me as the moſt

                  How S. Francis reputed him ſelfe the greateſt ſinner of the world
                  THE LXXXI. CHAPTER.
                  THat the more he humbled himſelfe on earth, the more he was exalted in heauen, was manifeſted vnto Brother Ruffinus in a reuelation whiles he was praying: for being rapt in ſpiritt,A viſion of Br. Ruffinus of the future glory of S. Franc. for his humility. he ſaw an high and eminent place in heauen, wherin was the Order of Seraphins, and among them a ſeat void farre more reſplendant then any other, and all couered with precious ſtones. Wherevpon with exceeding admiration he demaunded for whome that ſeat was prepared, and he heard a voice that ſaid: this ſeat was one of the principall Seraphins, that fell into hell, and now it is reſerued for the right humble Francis. After this viſion, Brother Ruffinus had an extreme deſire to know wherin principally conſiſted that ſo great humility which was ſo meritorious in the bleſſed Father ſaint Francis: hauing therfore ſome diſcourſe one day with him he ſaid: My beloued Father, I hartely beſeeche you to tell me certainely what is your owne eſteeme and what opinion you haue of your ſelfe. Sainct Francis anſweared: Verily I hold my ſelfe for the greateſt ſinner of the world, and toe ſerue God leſſe then any other. Brother Ruffinus replyed vnto him: that he did not thinck he could ſpeake the ſame ſincerily and with a cleare conſcience; it being ſo that others, as was apparent, did committ many greiuous ſinnes, wherof by the grace of God he was innocent. To this S. Francis anſweared: If God had with ſo great mercy fauoured thoſe others of whome you ſpeake, I am aſſured that how ſoeuer wicked and deteſtable they may be now, they would farre more gratefully acknowledge the giftes of God, then I doe and would ſerue him much better. And if my God ſhould now forſake me, I ſhould perpetrate more enormities then any other. In regard therfore of this ineffable grace done vnto me, I accuſe and acknowledge my ſelfe to be the greateſt ſinner that is. Brother Ruffinus by this anſweare was thoroughly confirmed in the viſion which God had ſhewed vnto him, hauing found good demonſtration of the meritt of the holy Fathers humility.
                  
                     Obiection of the author, and his ſolution. But becauſe humility ought alwayes to haue verytie for foundatiō, it ſeemeth one may make a ſufficient reply to this his anſweare and not without reaſon. For ſome one might thus argument: Moſt holy Father tell me if you pleaſe, by the exceſsiue loue which in this world you haue borne to the hūble Jeſus Chriſt, and att this preſēt more thē euer doe

beare him: where haue you learned, that if an other ſinner had receaued or ſhould receaue the talent of grace which God hath giuen you, that he would more acknowledge it, and make better profitt therof then you haue done? Vpon what reaſon, vpon what doctrine, and on what ſpiritt is grounded the foundation of this feeble opinion which you ſeeme to haue of your ſelfe? For I firmely beleue that ifThe anſwere. God had knowne it, he would neuer haue beſtowed this grace on you, but rather on that other. The moſt humble Father to this obiection might well anſweare, that he had learned it of the doctrine ofIohn. 3. our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, who with his mouth hath ſaid, The ſpiritt breatheth where he will; and of S. Paul, that neither1. Cor. 3. he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth, but he that giueth the increaſe, God: wherof he might thus inferre: I not being Francis, without God that worcketh in me, when he had pleaſed to inſpire an other, there is no doubt but he had done the like, and euen more according to his grace. And wheras you beleeue, that if God had giuen it to an other, it had bin knowne that he had done this or more, your beleefe is falſe: for as the ſame S. Paul ſaith, it is in the power of the Potter, to frame one pott for honour, and an other for diſhonour,Rom. 9. one for vſe of meat, and an other to ſerue for the chamber. Neuertheles it would be ridiculous, for the veſſell to complaine, and ſay: why is this honour giuen to him rather then to me? for thus it hath pleaſed him, becauſe he is the maſter.
                  
                     A worthy diſcourſe of humility. Cant. 1. But he might farther, and with much more reaſon alleadge the ſaying of the Eſpouſe: Conſider me not nor doe not admire that I am black, becauſe the ſunne hath taken away my collour: which hath no other ſignification, but that one ſhould not beleeue that this great deformity (which the humble preſuppoſeth in himſelfe) doth proceed of what ſoeuer cauſe indifferently, but that the ſunne of iuſtice, the liuing God, maketh it appeare ſo foule vnto his eyes: and not the light of the Moone, which is worldly wiſdome. And this, I ſay, proueth, not that he maketh the faire, foule in eſſence, but in apparence only, by comparaiſon made of a thing imperfectly faire, with an other beautifull in the higheſt degree. It being ſuppoſed then that I haue yet in me ſome good (as it may be) neuertheles when I fix mine eyes on that diuine ſunne of iuſtice, I am enforced and conſtrained to behold the great multitude of ſunne motes of mine imperfections in his cleare beames, wheron reflecting as one ought, I know my baſenes and mine imperfection to be infinite, and to become as a nothing in this mine accident all beauty. But becauſe that which is true cannot be otherwiſe: I retourne and reenter into my ſelfe, where conſidering the greatnes of my naturall baſenes, I acknowledge▪ nothing in my ſelfe but the grace of God that

doeth any thing▪ becauſe as man, there is no ſinne but I might haue cō
                     mitted. In which reſpect I ought to humble my ſelfe, and beleeue that touching this point there is no man in the world, any way inferiour vnto me. This equality layd, the force of humility doth after enter intoPſal. 21. his meritt: wheras among men we are all naturally equall in imperfections: therfore the truly humble doth honour and repute all other as greater then himſelfe, and that is the black colour, which the Sunne of his grace doth by his goodnes giue him, with which humilitie God himſelfe (made man) being cloathed, ſaid: I am not a man, but a worme, the contempt of men and out-caſt of the people. And if IESVS CHRIST ſpake this of himſelfe, who is the mouth of trueth, who can euer contemne a man and ſay that he doth falſely eſteeme himſelfe leſſe then other men. And therfore God doth farther ſay: learne of me becauſe I am meek and humble of hart; learne of me, ſaith he, becauſe he knew that proud humane ignorance, could not conceaue, I will not ſay teach, this doctrine more then humane by its apparentMatt. 11. and ſophiſticall reaſōs. But learne of me, to wit, what God is, and what is mā: for I being the one and the other together, none can better know thē my ſelfe, what difference there is betweene thes two. Now of this conſideratiō proceedeth true and perfect humility, and therfore it is greater in the bleſſed that clearly ſee the Sunne of iuſtice in his ſplendours, then in themſelues walking in the pilgrimage of this world, wherin by faith and imperfect charity they receaue the diuine beames only by reuerberation and reflection in the cloud of their imperfection: and therfore the nerer the true ſeruant approacheth vnto him with the vnderſtanding, the more humble he is. So, as the glorious virgin Mary was the moſt humble of all creatures on earth, euen ſo is ſhe moſt humble of all in heauen, though ſhe be att the right hand of her Sonne: becauſe the more ſhe doth participate of that diuine and infinite light, and doth more clearly and with greater glory contemplate that ſo great depth of the infinite and high diuine bounty, ſo much better doth ſhe ſee the goulfe of her litlenes, which in the end is to be a creature, which is nothing in compariſon of her Creatour, before whome ſhe bendeth her knees with farre more reuerence then euer did the foure and twenty ancientes, whome S. Iohn ſaw proſtrate before the throne of the liuing God, becauſe ſheApoc. 4. hath a deeper knowledge of him then they. Therfore lett all humane reaſon be ſilent, mute, and giue place in the certaine contemplation of true diuine humilitie, ſith it cannot penetrat the deep ſecrettes of God, by meane wherof, with a moſt miraculous operation it then raiſeth a ſoule more high, when it moſt debaſeth her to the profundity of her conſideration, and then it procureth her

a crowne in heauen, and maketh her true Queene in that eternall kingdome, when it cauſeth her to be inferiour, slaue, and ſubiect to all creatures for the only loue of God, which being her foundation, itWhat humility is. is not to be admired if her building ariſe to ſuch an hight. For humilitie is no other thing then a profound and continual humiliatiō of the ſoule vnto his diuine Maiſtie, cauſed by his diuine liberality. And therfore ſhe ought duely to conſider with what benignity his maieſty vnited himſelfe vnto vs, receauing into him our ſo baſe and abiect nature, wherof he would make vſe to raiſe and relieue our ſo extreme pouertie: of this knowledge will▪ grow and encreaſe in the ſoule the true loue and approbation of the obligation we haue vnto God. It cannot be expreſſed how inſatiable a thing it is to deſire alwayes to correſpond vnto IESVS CHRIST, in worckes, miſpriſing ones ſelfe for his loue, and euer deſirously giuing eare vnto the foreſaid voice. Learne of me, by the true doctrine whereof there arriueth vnto the ſoule by ſuch a humility, ſubiection, not only vnto God and his commandementes, but euen, for his loue vnto all creatures, and ſhe reputeth them her betters and ſuperiours, though they be ſinners, hauing her eye only one her baſenes or lownes, which is ſuch, as cannot be greater. So miſpriſing her ſelfe to the vtmoſt, ſhe ſaith with her Lord IESVS CHRIST. I am a worme, and not a man, the contempt of men, and the out caſt of the people. By which wordes the queſtion is cleared and reſolued.
               
               
                  Of the diſcourſes and exerciſes of the humility of S. Francis.
                  THE LXXXII. CHAPTER.
                  THe ſaid holy Father would not haue any thing in his Religion, were it neuer ſo excellent, but it ſhould in its kinde, euen exteriourlie preach Lowlineſſe and Humilitie. Wherfore he reiected the title of preacher of Pennance, which Pope Innocent the third had graunted to him and his, and would that his Religion ſhould be called Minors, and that they ſhould conſerue them ſelues, liuing like Minors, as true children of the Apoſtolicall rule. And for the ſame cauſe he would not that the ſuperiours ſhould be called Priors, but Miniſters and ſeruantes:Matt. 20. (A name impoſed by IESVS CHRIST, in the goſpell, when he ſaid, that he was come to ſerue) to the end that by ſuch a ſurname, they might be alwayes mindfull both of their office and of their author IESVS CHRIST. He would alſo that they ſhould be

called Guardians, that they might guard their Brethren. Then alſo he would that his Religious ſhould rather conuerſe with the poore then with the rich and potent of the world. And to conſerue them in humilitie, he exerciſed them to ſweepe the houſe, waſh diſhes, dreſſe meat, and to ſerue the leapers and diſeaſed in hoſpitals, and in althinges to renounce their proper will. For though he were Generall, he notwithſtanding did nothing of his owne head, he conſulted with thē, or more often with God in prayer, who reuealed vnto him what he ſhould doe, both for himſelfe and others. He was not aſhamed to learne of the leaſt, the ſmalleſt matter that was, as being a true Minor. He had alſo leerned high and worthy matters of his ſoueraigne maſter IESVS-CHRIST, yea the principall philoſophy. Whiles he liued he alwayes deſired to learne of the learned and of the ſimple, of the perfect and imperfect, of the great and litle, the meane wherby he might become perfect and the true ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST. He was thanckfull to the moſt ſimple and abiect that taught him any thing, yea ſo farre foorth as to kneele vnto them.
                  Once when he was very ſicke, and being deſirous to viſitt an oratory, and to that end mounted one an aſſe, he mett by the way an old country man that laboured on the land, who ſeing him, forbare hisS. Francis very humbly thancked a country man that admonished him. labour and asked his companion if that were not the famous Francis, who was ſo much ſpoaken of: and he anſweared that it was. Tourning then to S. Francis he ſaid, Brother, endeauour with all thy poſsibilitie to be vertuous as thou art generally reputed: for many haue a ſtrong beleefe in thy perſon. Behaue thy ſelfe therfore in ſuch ſort that there be nothing in thee but what is expected. The holy Father then deſcended from his aſſe, and falling on his knees thancked and kiſſed the feet of the country man, for the charitable admonition which he had giuen him.
               
               
                  Of the constancie and courage of S. Francis, and in what manner he exerciſed and proued the Nouices in humilitie and obedience.
                  THE LXXXIII. CHAPTER.
                  AS the holy Father obeyed the good counſaile of the moſt ſimple man that was, ſo when on the contrary their aduiſe was diabolicall, he would neuer coudiſcend vnto them, therin diſcouering the conſtancie &amp; vertue of his courage, as it appeared by the conſaile which the Card, of Hoſtia would giue him in behalfe of

                     k that the Religious were admitted into his Order rather for ſome benifitt and temporall commodity, then by zeale of ſauing their ſoules: beſide the occaſiō which might be giuē them to erre frō that firſt naked pouerty: theſe kind of matters excepted, he permitted himſelfe, in all the reſt (prouided that it were not contrary to God or the Order) to be gouerned as others would, renouncing his owne will, euen as he procured his other Religious to renounce theirs, and to ſubmit themſelues to that of their ſuperiour. S. Francis laid ſo ſure a foundation on this vertue of humility, that For loue of it he affected obedience and pouerty her daughters: by obedience he particulerly proued what Nouiſes were fitt for his Order, and what not: as he practiſed on two yong men, who deſired the habitt, whome he tryed after this ſtrange manner.
                  He brought them into a garden, where he commanded them to aſſiſt him to tranſplant colewortes, as he did, he began to plant the leaues into the earth and the rootes vp into the aire, where vpon one of themWhat promptitude and ſimplicity S. Franc. deſired in the obedience of his Religious. reaſoned the matter with the S. ſaying: No, Father, it muſt not be done ſo but cleene contrary. The S. replyed, doe as I doe and queſtion no more: but the yong man not conceauing the vertue of God, and eſteeming it foly would not doe it: wherfore the holy Father ſaid vnto him: Brother▪ I perceaue you are a greatmaſter, and therfore vnfitt for my Order: and ſo he diſmiſſed him, and to the other that had done as he did, he preſently gaue the habitt. And becauſe he was neuer ſufficiently to his contentment exerciſed in this his vertue of humility, he one day ſaid vnto his Religious, that praying God to voutſafe to manifeſt vnto him when he was his true ſeruant, and when not: God had anſwered him that he was his true ſeruant when he thought, ſpake, or did any thing concerning his ſeruice. And therfore Brethren, ſaid he, tourning to them, I now▪ pray you, when you ſhall ſee me faile therin, to reprehend me publikelie and ſhame me. He would neuer permitt himſelfe to be priuiledged more then an other in matters of honour, nor in any other particulerly, that might procure him contentment, in worldly matters, in

                  Of the ſubiection and humility, wherin S. Francis would that his Religious should liue, vnder the holy Romaine church, with their obedience vnto Preiſtes.
                  THE LXXXIV. CHAPTER.
                  HE would that his diſciples ſhould be ſubiect to the holy Catholique Romaine church, and that they ſhould alſo ſhew themſelues humble and obedient to the Preiſtes thereof, and for the greater confirmation of this point, he left his Religion, ſo recommendable vnto the church. And goeing the ſecond time to Rome for confirmation of his Rule, he ſaid to his Religious: I goe to recommend this Order to the Church, of which I will that the euill be puniſhed, and the children of obedience be fauoured for their good; and therfore, when the children ſhall know the ſweet benefitt of their mother, they will alwayes with a ſinguler deuotion follow her doctrine: and one the contrary, he that wilbe a child of Baal and of diſobedience, ſhall not remaine vnpuniſhed, nor liue in the Order, vnder the winges of her protection. The holy church wil maintaine the glory of our pouerty, and will not permitt the beautie of humillity to be deſtroyed, by the ſmoake of vanity, pride, and ambition, and will conſerue in you the bondes of peace and charity, ſeuerlie reprehending and chaſticing thoſe that ſhall diuide themſelues from her rule and vertue, that it perpetually floriſh in the obſeruance of euangelicall purity, in her preſence, and God will not permitt it to looſe the ſweet odour which he hath giuen it. Such was the intention of S. Francis, to ſubiect his Religious vnto the Catholike church, ordayning that they ſhould alwayes chooſe a Cardinall of it for their protectour, as a thing that he knew to be neceſſary for the good of the Order. He did not intend that they ſhould be ſubiect to the ſaid protectour only; but likewiſe to all Prelates and Preiſtes of the Church, ſaying thus: Know ye that we are calledFreer Minors Eccleſiasticall aſsiſtants. Coadiutours of Preiſtes and Religious, for ſauing of ſoules: and therfore lett the church be in that ſort aſsiſted by vs, and her holy faith augmented; I euer vnderſtood the Biſhop of Aſsiſium his ſpeech to tend thereto, when att the beginning of my conuerſion, he admoniſhed

me to gouerne my ſelfe diſcreetly, that in theſe turbulent times, myne Order did not mount his hornes, and proue diſobedient vnto the Church, therfore I euer did, and will that others doe cary a ſpeciall reuerence to the Prelates, and Religious therof.
                  Further, conſidering that there is nothing more gratefull to God then the ſaluation of ſoules, as S. Paul ſaith, the ſame ſhalbe better accompliſhed by the peace and amity of good Religious, then by their diſcordes: and therfore if any among them ſeeke to hinder it, I will not that you contradict the ſame, but that you leaue the care to God, and lett it ſuffice you to be ſubiect vnto them, and on your part to liue ſo vertuously that by your occaſion there ariſe no diſcordes or debates amongThe Clergy muſt be ſupported. you, which doeing, you ſhall in one ſame inſtant gaine vnto God, the Clergie, Religion, and the people: which ſhalbe more gratefull to his diuine Maieſty, then to gaine only the people: endeauour therefore not to ſcandalize the Clergie, but as much as is poſsible, conceale their defectes, and ſupply where they ſeeme to haue failed. For recompenſe her of it is, that the holy church in his praiſe doth ſing this ſolemne antheme: Francis the Religious Catholique, and a man entierly Apoſtolique;How much S. Francis would that his Religious should honour Preiſtes. taught Chriſtians to obſerue, defend, and formally beleeue the faith of the Romane Church, and that Preiſtes were to be reuerenced aboue all others.
                  When he ſent his Religious ouer the world, one of the documentes which he gaue them, was that when they mett a Preiſt, they ſhould incontinently fall on their knees before him, kiſſe his hand, and aske his benediction: and in caſe ſo happening, ſhould ſweep the Church, and ſhould reſt and lodge rather with them then otherwhere.

This his example was of ſuch force, that art the beginning▪ of the eſtabliſhment of his Order, and in the reformation of the obſeruance, his Religious did exceedingly priſe Preiſt-hood, yea did ſhunne to be Preiſtes: ſo that in a Couent full of Religious, there were very few Preiſtes, all endeauouring to mount to diuine communicatiō, rather by meane of prayer, humility, and ſimplicity, then by high degrees, and dignities without meritt.
               
               
                  
                  How ſaint Francis by his humility, did edifie and conuert his neighbour.
                  THE LXXXV. CHAPTER.
                  IT is not then to be admired, if this holy Father exerciſed humilitie, not only that his ſoule might be pleaſing vnto God, who is ennemy to the proude, and moſt liberall of grace, towardes the humble, but alſo that by meane of it, he might edifie his neighbour, and conuert ſoules vnto God, by way of humility pourchaſing that which otherwiſe he could not haue obtayned, as for example: Arriuing one day att Imola there to preach, and hauing demaunded leaue of the Biſhop, he gaue him anſweare that himſelfe could ſufficiently diſchardge the office of preaching vnto his people. The holy Father therfore bowing downe his head, departed;A Bishop refuſing to permit S. Franc. to preach in his dioceſe was att lenght conſtrayned by his humility to accord vnto him. Gen. 32. but being afterward inſpired of God, he retourned thither▪; the Biſhop ſeeing him, very rigourously asked him what he did, and what he ſought there; S. Francis very humbly anſweared him that if a ſonne were by his Father driuen out att one dore, the naturall loue which he boare him would conſtraine him to enter againe att an other. Which the biſhop hearing, being ouercome with his humility, he embraced him, ſaying: that himſelfe and all his Religious ſhould thenceforward with a generall licence freely preach ouer all his biſhopperick, becauſe humility deſerued it. I know hereby, added he, that it is no meruaile, if humility encline the will of man, ſith it enforceth euen the omnipotent diuine will to condiſcend to the deſires of the humble, as the Angel ſaid to Iacob: If thou haſt bin ſtrong againſt God, how much more ſhalt thou preuaile againſt men? The holy Father then with this arme of humility deliuered many ſoules out of the handes of the deuill, and out of the throat of hell, as we haue ſeene and by the example following ſhall appeare.
                  Certainne Religious miniſtring vnto a leaper, as S. Francis had commaunded them, could not by any gracious vſage whatſoeuer, giue him cōtentment; nor, beſides the iniuries which he vttered againſt them, and the buffettes which he gaue them, all which they cōtentedly eudured, could procure him to forbeare to blaſpheme againſt God and his SS. being thervnto induced by the deuil and by the extreme violence of his diſeaſe. Theſe good Religious vnable to ſupport thoſe blaſphemies, that were ſo horrrible as would haue made an Infidell to tremble, they went to the holy Father, who in perſon reſolued to viſitt him. And entring into the chamber of the ſicke, he ſaid: My Brother

God giue thee his peace, and he anſweared: What peace can I haue, ſith from the time that God did interiourly and exteriourly deprine me of it, I haue euer bin in cruell warre? S. Francis comforting him, replyed: My Brother and Freeind, you muſt haue patience: for theſe afflictions which you endure in body wil auaile to the ſaluation of your ſoule, if you patientlie ſupport them. But the leaper anſweared: how can I poſsibly haue patience, conſidering that myne afflictions are ſo permanent that they permitt me no eaſe day, nor night, and beſides your Religious doe exceedingly aggrauate the greife of mine infirmity: for not onlie they doe not aſsiſt and ſerue me, but they afflict me euen to death. The holy Father knowing by diuine inſpiration, that this wretch was tourmented by the deuill: went preſentlie to offer his prayers for him, which done, he retourned and ſaid vnto him: Goe to, my good freind ſith theſe Religious doe not ſerue you well, I will ſerue you my ſelfe. The Leaper anſweared: Tell me I pray, what will you doe more then they? the S. replyed▪ I will doe whatſoeuer you ſhall cammand me, begin from this inſtant to tell me what you pleaſe to haueS. Franc. by admirable humility &amp; patience cured a leaper within &amp; without. and I promiſe to doe it. I will, ſaid the leaper, that you waſh all my body, for I cannot endure the filthy ſauour therof. I will moſt willingly doe it, anſweared the S. and ſodenly cauſed to be prepared a bath of veri
                        •
                      pleaſing hearbes, then diſcloathed him to his skinne, and waſhed him, one of the Religious powring water on his body.
                  But there hapened a notable miracle, whiles the holy Father with his pitifull handes waſhed him, all the ſcurfes of his leapry one after an other fell off, ſo that the fleſh remayned cleane and neat as of a litle child: in fine, he was entierly cleanſed and cured within and without. The diſeaſed perſon therfore knowing this great miracle, began very bitterly to lament, ſaying: I am worthy not of one, but of a thouſand helles, as well for hauing blaſphemed againſt God, as for the contempts, iniuries, and buffettes, wherby I haue offended your poore Religious, that ſo louingly haue miniſtred vnto me. And after his cure he remayned fifteene dayes in this lamentation, then he made a generall confeſsion, imploring the ayd of our Lord IESVS CHRIST. S. Francis left him not till fearing himſelfe, for the great concourſe of people that repayred to this miracle, he was conſtrayned to depart, ſo leauing the man in the grace of God, who ſhortly after paſſed from this world into an other. And incontinentlie, the holie Father being in prayer, he appeared vnto him in heauen more bright then the ſunne, and ſaid: Father, know you me? The S. asked him, who are you? And he anſweared, I am the ſoule of that leaper whome liuing in the world, God cured by your prayers and humility. I now enter into the kingdome of glory, for which I giue

thanckes to God and you, bleſſed be your wordes and your actions alſo, whereby many ſoules in the world are ſaued. Know that there paſſeth no day, but the Angels and SS. in heauen giue glorie and prayſe to God, for the innumerable fruites which by your meane and your Order are procured in the Church: and therefore perſeuer to the time predeſtinated to your great crowne: hauing ſaid thus much, he diſappeared, leauing the S. exceedingly comforted, who gaue thanckes to God for all, and particulerly for the ſauing of that ſoule, who was in ſuch imminent perill of damnation.
               
               
                  Of three famous theeues conuerted by the humility and charity of S. Francis, the eight chapter, of the tenth booke, transferred to this place as moſt proper vnto it.
                  THE LXXXVI. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Angelus being Gardian att Mount Caſal, three famous theeues haunted that place, doeing cruell murders thereabout, who being one day oppreſſed with hungar, came to him demaunding ſomewhat to eat. The good Guardian knowing them, not only refuſed to giue them almoſe, but began to check and reprehend them: alleadging that they feared not God nor men whome they ſo miſerablie slew, liuing by the labours of others, and leading a life more diabolicall then humane, robbing, diſhonouring, tormenting and cutting the throates of their neighbour as they did, and that he admired how the earth did ſuſtaine them, that it did not ſwallow them quick as they were: and ſo bad them haſt away, and withall rudely ſhutt the dore againſt them, wherevpon they in extreme choller departed. S. Francis a litle after came with one of his companions vnto that place, to whome the Guardian recounted the precedent; whereto the holy Father anſweared, that he had done very ill, becauſe ſuch ſinners retourne to God and are conuerted, rather by ſweet and pittifull wordes, then by ſuch reprehenſions which did rather harden them, and that therfore God ſaid, They that are in health, need not a Phiſition, but they that are ill att eaſe, &amp; that he came not to call the iuſt, but ſinners to repentance. And therefore, added he becauſe you haue done againſt charity, the commandemēt of the goſpell, &amp; the example of IESVS CHRIST, I command you in vertue of obedience, for pennance to cary them to the mountaine where they are, this loafe of bread &amp; this flagon of wine, which was giuen vs by the way, &amp; when you come in their preſence, fall one your knees at their feet, and aske thē pardō for the wordes you haue ſpoken: &amp; when

they haue taken the bread, entreat them in my behalfe to Ieaue that miſerable kinde of life, and I will prouide for all their neceſsities, and vſe all the art you can deuiſe to induce them hither. The moſt obedient Guardian preſentlie went on, and the holy father in the meane while went to the Church to pray for them, whence he departed not till God had heard him.
                  Brother Angelus comming to the theeues, and hauing performed the commandement of S. Francis, whiles they did eat the bread, one of them ſaid to the others; Alas what ſhall become of vs ſottiſh wretches, what muſt be our lott, what horrible torments are prepared for vs in hell, for ſo many theftes and murders as we daylie perpetrat? neither yet haue we any ſcruple, much leſſe feare of God, or repentance for ſo many enormous ſinnes. And this Religious who hath brought vs to eat, is come thus farre, with ſo great humility to aske vs pardon for one only word iuſtlie vttered vnto vs, admoniſhing vs according to our deſert, in the meane while we wretched theeues and deteſtable robbers, neuer demaund pardon of God. Beſides this he hath ſheuen vs charity praying vs to repaire to that holy Father, who hath ſent vs releefe, who for the zeale he hath of our ſoules, doth ſo freelie offer vs alwayes to prouide vs all our neceſsities. They are true ſervantes of God who haue already gayned heauen: but what ſhall we doe, who being children of the deuill, euery day heape ſinnes vpon ſinnes, conſidering withall that our ſinnes are ſo enormous as deſerue of God, rather puniſhment then pardon. Myne opinion therfore is, that it were very conuenient, ſith God doth ſeeme to call vs by this Religious, that we make no longer delay, nor abuſe the patience of his diuine maieſty, but that we repaire vnto him, and he will inſtruct vs in the direct way how to free our ſelues att length from hell, and euen to meritt mercy.
                  The other two theeues being of the ſame opinion, they went together with the Guardiā to the holy Father, in whoſe preſence being com they kneeled att his feete, ſaying: Father we haue litle hope, by reaſon of the enormity of our ſinnes, that God will vſe mercie vnto vs, but if you aſſure vs that we may yet finde grace, behold vs here ready to doe whatſoeuer you ſhall command vs. The holy Father receaued them verie amiably cheriſhed and encouraged them, affirming withall that they ſhould not doubt but God was very ready to pardon them, whenſoeuer they ſhould be reſolued to leaue their ſinnes, and that they ſhould reſt aſſured therof, otherwiſe they ſhould committ a greater ſinne then any other that they had formerly comitted: and therfore he promiſed and aſſured them God would pardon them all. Theſe three theues therfore being conuerted, did not only abandon their lewd life, but did perfectly

renounce the world, and became Religious of his Order, where liuing piously, two of thē a litle after paſſed from this life to a better. But the third liued many yeares after, wherin often conſidering the enormity of his ſinnes paſt, he was ſo penitent for them that for fifteene yeares together he faſted three dayes euery weeke, with only bread and water, beſides the lent and ordinary abſtinences of the Order, and was neuer cloathed but with an old habitt without tunicle, he diſciplined himſelfe euery day, and after mattins slept no more, but continued ſtill in prayer. In this time S. Francis departed to the glory which God had prepared him: and he ſuruiuing, perſeuering, and continuyng in the aſperity of life which he had begun, and in continuall and feruent prayers, had a reuelation from God of the paines of hell, and of the glory of Paradice, ſuch as followeth:
               
               
                  A reuelation of the paines of hell and of the glory of Paradiſe preſented after the death of S. Francis to one of the aforeſaid theeues, whome hauing no more cauſe to mention, and they being conuerted by the▪ holy Father S. Francis, it ſeemeth not improper to put in the place of their conuerſion, and to take it out of the ninth chapter of the tenth booke, diſorderly there inſerted.
                  THE LXXXVII. CHAPTER.
                  THis theefe conuerted by S. Francis, being according to his cuſtome one night after matines in prayer, he found himſelfe ſo oppreſſed with sleepe, that he could not ouercome it howſoeuer he ſtrayned himſelfe againſt it, ſo that he was enforced to fall into a deep sleepe, and was incontinentlie eleuated in ſpiritt by the Angel of God, that carryed him ouer an high mountaine all enuironned with groſſe cutting ſtones, vpon which the Angell that carryed him lett him fall, from the toppe of the mountaine euen to the bottome of the vally, where being vtterlie cruſhed, as he ſeemed and rather dead then aliue, the Angell called him and bid him ariſe: becauſe he had yet a long iorney to make. The Religious anſweared him: how is it poſsible you ſhould be ſo cruell as that, ſeeing in what plight I am, you would I ſhould trauaile? The Angel then touching him cured all his greifes: then goeing before him, ſhewed him a field full of ſharpe ſtones, thornes &amp; wild thiſſels, which he commāded him to paſſe through bare foot as he was. The Religious knowing no excuſe, paſſed through it, with ſuch paine as may be imagined. After that he forced him to ēter into a burning furnace which was at the end of the ſaid feild: for hauing refuſed to enter in, he cauſed him to be throwne in

with a forcke, by the deuils there preſent. Hauing remayned ſome time in that eternall fire, there enduring that, which he alone that hath proued it can expreſſe, the Angel drue him out, and bid him prepare himſelfe to paſſe further: wherevpon he lamenting that without any pitty he would force him further, ſo burned and halfe dead as he was, the Angel touched him and cured his burning. Then he brought him vpon a bridge; that was in ſuch ſort made as he could not paſſe it without falling; for it was narrow and round, ſo that the feet could take no hold theron. Vnder it there ran a very ſwifte flud full of fearefull and terrible dragons and ſerpentes: the Religious therefore excuſed himſelfe, affirming that he could not paſſe it without falling: the Angell bid him follow him and not to feare, but in his goeing, to ſett his feet where he ſhould ſee him ſtepp before. So was he enforced to follow him euen to the middes of the bridge with a feare that freezed his breſt: but the worſt was, that being there, the Angel diſappearing, left him, and aſcended a mountaine, whereon was a very beautifull citty, leauing the poore Religious in ſuch feare as each one may imagine: who beheld vnder the bridge thoſe horrible dragons, that with open mouth attended his fall only to deuoure him inſtantly.
                  He being in ſuch extremity, not knowing what elſe to doe, very fixedly embraced the bridge, and began to lament and inuocate the name of IESVS, whome he beſought to haue pitty on him in that extreme neceſsity, and to deliuer him of that imminent perill. God hauing heard him, he ſeemed by litle and litle to haue winges grow out on his backe: wherevpon he began to hope, that his winges growing great he ſhould fly vnto his guide. Now wanting patience to expect the full growth of his winges, ſuch being his deſire to be thence, he endeauoured to fly: but he fell againe on the bridge, and his winges alſo were looſed from hisPſal. 54. backe. Wherefore embracing the bridge againe, he began to lament and with the Prophet to ſay: Who ſhall giue me winges of a▪ doue, that flying from ſo perillous and mortall eſtate, I may attaine a ſecure repoſe? Onely thou my lord IESVS CHRIST, my ſole hope and true redreſſe. He had ſcarcely ended theſe wordes, but his winges did grow againe: but he had no more power then before to expect the ſufficient growth of his winges▪ by reaſon of his extreme feare, ſo that he fell and loſt them againe. Then he prayed, and reſolued to expect till his winges were fitt to carry him, though euery hower ſeemed to him a thouſand yeares. So hauing attended till he knew them to be of ſufficient ſtrēght and force, he mounted into the aire, and flew vp to the high mountaine where his guide was, where they both together went towardes the gate of that ſupreme citty, wherinto the Porter admitting the Angell, made him ſtay without, aſking him who he was, and who emboldened

him to come there, He anſweared that he was a Frere Minor, and that his cōming ſo farre was not of preſumption or of his owne motion, but was conducted thither. The Porter replyed. Attend till I call S. Francis to ſee if he know thee. In the meane while the Religious vewed the walles and ſtructure of that admirable citty, that were ſo luſtrious and reſplendent, and with all tranſparent to behold all the iubilyes and exultations made by the Angels and bleſſed within, which to his exceeding contentement beholding, he ſaw the holy Father S. Francis comming and with him brother Bernard Quintaualle his firſt diſciple and other Religious his companions, trayned with an infinite number of the bleſſed: who ſeeing him commanded the Porter to admitt him in which he did: and he was very amourously receaued by the holy Father, who ſhewed him all the meruailes wherof neither the eye nor eare, nor vnderſtanding of any mortall man is capable.
                  The Religious was ſo ſatisfied and content with this vew, and in his ſoule conceaued ſuch conſolation therof, that he no more remēbred all his trauailes paſt, then if he had neuer endured them. S. Francis then ſaid vnto him. My ſonne admire no more: for it is neceſſary that thou retourne into the world: but greiue not, for God hath appointed thee a very ſhort time of ſeauen dayes only, that in the meane time thou mayeſt prepare the better: which ended I my ſelfe will come to thee, and will conduct the thither to enioy with me this immortall glorie. The bleſſed Father S. Francis with a very rich mantell, and his holy ſtigmates glittered as ſhinning ſtarres, with ſuch a ſplendour, that he ſeemed with his beames to illuminate the greateſt part of that great citty. The Religious did there know many SS. of S. Francis his company whome he had ſeene in the world, all whome he nomminated att his retourne. Att length hauing receaued the benediction of S. Francis, he awakened out of his sleepe and heard the bell ringing to the Prime for it was yet early morning, and he ſeemed to haue ſpent many yeares in his iorney; he thē recounted the viſion to his Guardian and the Religious, for the cō
                     ſolation of all ſuch as liue in labours and afflictions: and to demonſtrate that whatſoeuer ſinners they be, God doth neuer abandon any one, but doth euer aſsiſt and preſerue them in all their tribulations, till he bring them to his kingdome. Now for confirmation of all the precedent, the Religious fell incontinently ſick, and with an admirable feruour of ſpiritt prepared himſelfe for his laſt houre. The ſeauen dayes expired, the glorious Father S. Francis came as he had promiſed and carryed the ſoule of this theefe into Paradice. This holy Father then by this humility in this ſort gayned ſoules vnto God, as by the enſuyng example ſhall more appeare.
               
               
                  
                  How S. Francis conuerted certaine other theeues: this was the 27. chapter of the 10. book, transferred hither as a place more proper vnto it.
                  THE LXXXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THere were certaine theeues that had their reſidence on an high mountaine, whence they diſcended to robbe the paſſengers they found on the wayes, and ſome time very hungar conſtrayned them to aske bread for the loue of God att the Couent of the Freer Minors, neere the borough of S. Sepulcre: ſome of the Religious affirmed that it was not well done to giue them almoſe being theeues and murderers, ſuch as ought not to be releiued to the detriment of the cō
                     mon weale. Others neuertheles of compaſsion gaue them almoſe, ſtill admoniſhing them to leaue that lewd and deteſtable life, and to doe pennance for it. But S. Francis one day accidentallie comming to that Couent, the Religious propoſed this doubt vnto him, to whome he anſweared: If you follow mine aduice, I hope by the grace of God, you ſhall gaine him thoſe ſoules: which is, that you take bread and wine, of each of the beſt you haue, and carry it them to the mountaine whither they are retired, and that calling them, you very louingly vſe this ſpeeche vnto them: Brethren, feare not: for we are Religious that bring you to eat, then preſentlie ſpread your cloakes on the ground, and ſett them your bread vpon it, and with a ioyfull humility miniſter vnto them, till they haue done eating: After that in fauour of that charity on your part exhibited, and of what you may thenceforward doe them, pray and coniure them not to hurt, kill, or offend any man perſonnally, and for that firſt time require no other thing of them. An other day according to the good anſweare they ſhall giue you, you ſhall carry them other bread, wine, egges and cheeſe, which you ſhall preſent vnto them with the greateſt humility and kindenes that you can, then you ſhall ſay vnto them: Brethren we know wel what moueth you to liue in theſe mountaines, with ſo many inconueniēces, feares and perils both of body and ſoule, which you will vndoubtedly bring to ruine if you perſeuer in this courſe. Therfore we counſaile you for the beſt, to giue ouer this life, to putt your confidence in God, and he wil neuer abandon you in your temporall neceſsities. On our part we will not faile for his loue and yours to releiue you, att leaſt to ſaue your ſoules: and I hope in our Lord, ſaid the holy Father, by this your charity and humility, you ſhall conuert them, which proued true. For theſe Religious following

that counſaile, the vertue of the holy Ghoſt in a moment deſcended on the theeues in ſuch ſort that, moued by the demonſtrations of thoſe good Religious, they beleeued them, ſo that by litle and litle the greater part of them entred into the Order and there liued piously; and the reſt hauing ſworne vnto the Religious that they would amend themſelues, ſpent their time in very great repoſe, and ended their liues as good Chriſtians, to the exceeding contentment and edification of all the country, who for the ſame gaue thanckes to God and to thoſe good Religious.
               
               
                  How much S. Francis shunned and abhorred honours for the loue of humility.
                  THE LXXXIX. CHAPTER.
                  THough by the precedent it may be ſufficiently vnderſtood how much S. Francis ſhunned worldly glory, and on the cōtrary how he reioyced when God was prayſed by his worckes: yet it will more manifeſtly appeare by this which we are to ſpeake of him, on this occaſion: Hauing one day ended his ſermon in the citty of Iterrena, the biſhop aroſe, and after he had made a ſhort exhortation to his people, in the end he ſaid: That frō the time that God had planted the Church, he neuer abandoned it: but did alwayes illuminate and aſsiſt it by meane of ſome perfect men that continually ſupported the ſame, but now he did illuſtrate and maintayne it more then euer in this poore bare-foot and idiott, vtterlie miſpriſed for his loue: wherevpon he concluded, that they were much obliged to giue thanckes vnto his diuine maieſty, for that his ſinguler benefitt. As ſoone asS. Franc. very gratiouſly thancked a bishop for publikely calling him idiot. the biſhop had ended, S. Francis doeing him reuerence; very ioyfull replyed: doubtles, My Lord, neuer man in the world hath to this day ſo much honoured me as your ſelfe: for ſome ſay of me, this man is holy, and when God worcketh any thing by me, many reflecting on me only, giue not to God the glory due to his diuine maieſty: but you (as wiſe and prudent) haue ſeparated the vile from the precious: wherefore falling on his knees before him, he kiſſed his handes and departed, leauing the biſhop exceedingly edified.
                  
                     S. Franc. his anſwere being called S. If any one called him S. he would incōtinētlie anſweare. If God ſhould take frō me the treaſure of his grace which he hath giuen me in cuſtodie, there would remaine to me only my body and ſoule, both burdened with ſinnes and extreme blindnes, as are the damned and infidels: but as the picture and ſculpture, where the images of God and of the glorious

virgin are engrauen and peinted in wood or ſtone, are reuerenced and honoured as figures of the true image, and as they are ſtone or wood no honour is attributed vnto them: euen ſo, a man that is the true image and portraiture of God, if he be honoured as ſuch, he ought not to attribute that reuerence to himſelfe, but to God whom he repreſenteth: yea he ought to repute himſelf in regard of his ſinnes moſt worthy of all infamy in this world.
                  
                     Why S. Francis once ſuffered his habit, hands, &amp; feet to be kiſsed. With the like ſpiritt he one day receaued the honour which the people gaue him, who kiſſed his habitt, his handes and feet, without making them any kinde of reſiſtance, his companion that ſaw the holy Father to ſtand ſtill and admitt thoſe honours, thought with himſelfe that he was glad therof, and vainely conceaued pleaſure thxerin, as afterward he told him: but the holy Father anſweared him. Brother, theſe people performe not the leaſt part of what they ought to doe: Whereat his ſaid companion was more ſcandalized: S. Francis then added: Brother I attribute not to my ſelfe, but to God, all theſe honours which thou ſeeſt preſented vnto me, whoſe althinges are, and I remayne in my vile eſtate, which doth not conclude that the preſenters gaine nothing thereby: becauſe by that meane God is acknowledged and honoured in his creatures. The Religious by this anſweare was entierlie ſatisfied, with an exceeding admiration of his perfection: conſidering that when he reflected on himſelfe, he could not on the other ſide in any ſort endure prayſes and honours.
                  
                     And how att an other time he shunned honour that should haue bin giuen him. Goeing one time to Rome, the Biſhop of a citty (whoſe name is periſhed in the authors) by whoſe dioceſſe he was to paſſe, went againſt him out of the towne to entertayne him: which the S. in ſpiritt foreſeeing, he ſaid to his companion: We may be here moleſted, for theſe men which you ſee, come to honour vs, which we cannot avoide, there being no meane to tourne out of the way: come therfore after me. He led him to a groſſe heape of chaulke that was cloſe by the way, whereof they made veſſels, on which he mounted and did very nimbly tread thereon with his feet. Which the biſhop and his followers beholding, they retourned without giuing him a word. So the holy Father reiected the honour, and a while after he entred ſecretlie into the Citty, where he edified more by example of pious life then by wordes of doctrine.
               
               
                  
                  How by humility he diſcouered his owne imperfections, and what a capitall ennemy he was to hipocriſie.
                  THE XC. CHAPTER.
                  TO the end that ſuch as ſaw him labour vertuously, and performe holy and pious actes extraordinarily, might not imagine that what he did proceeded of any other then of God, that wrought in him, he publiquely diſcouered whatſoeuer defectes he thought to be in himſelfe, though moſt commonly they were no defectes att all. Being one day very ſicke, he by obedience rebated ſome litle of his abſtinence: but beginning a litle to amend, the true miſpriſer of himſelfe taking courage againſt his fleſh, for greater confuſion, he ſaid in himfelfe: It is not requiſite that the people repute me ſobre and abſtinēt, and I on the contrary ſecretly eat fleſh. And ſo, moued by the holyS. Franc. went naked to the market place of Aſsiſe to accuſe himſelfe of hauing eatē flesh in his ſicknes. Ghoſt, he commanded ſome of his Religious, to faſten a rope about his necke and to lead him to the marckett place of the Citty of Aſsiſium. But his Religious refuſing to obey him, he putt of his habitt, and with nothing on him but that with was vnder it, he went into the place, called the Berlina, where, notwithſtanding he had a quartane aigue, and therefore was very feeble, he began to preach, and when he ſaw that there was a great concurſe of people, he affirmed publikely that they ought not eſteeme him otherwiſe ſpirituall, becauſe in that his lent, wherin he had accuſtomed to faſt in the honour of Alſainctes; he had eaten fleſh, for which he prayed them to reprehend him. All the aſsiſtantes ſeeing ſo great a humilitie, conceaued a deep conpunction in thēſelues, and ſighing ſayd: Ah we miſerable wretches, that liue continually in ſinne, and entierlie apply our ſelues to the commodities of this life, without doeing pennance, what will become of vs, ſith this S. lamenteth to haue eaten fleſh in time not prohibited, and vpon a iuſt and manifeſt neceſsitie? he doth neuertheles repent it, and with ſo much confuſion accuſeth himſelfe, though he ſeeme neerer death then life: why learne we not of him, who leadeth a life rather to be admired then imitated, and who is a true pourtraiture of perfect humily, and as the imitatour of IESVS CHRIST, contemneth and treadeth vnder foot the world and the honour therof, reiecting the ſhadow of hypocriſy, wherein each one either more or leſſe is intricated?
                  But all this was litle in compariſon of what he did ordinarily for to mortifie the firſt motiues of the ambitions of the world and to batter them againſt the moſt firme rocke IESVS

CHRIST, he did as▪ followeth: As often as there aſſailed him any motion of pride or vaine glorie; being before the people, he confeſſed it to the world, ſaying ſometime to his companion: I endeauour to liue in the preſence of God in an hermitage

But he would neuer conſent thereto without condition that there ſhould be an other ſowed without, that each one might know he woare a skinne on his fleſh.

                  Saint Francis being in Alexandria, a citty of Italy, he was entertayned into the houſe of a gentleman, who being very deuout vnto him, ſaid: you muſt reſolue to obey the goſpell, and eat whatſoeuer ſhalbe preſented vnto you, and thus ſaying, he cauſed a Capon to be brought: wherof the holy Father with the benediction of God did eat; meane while a poore man asked an almoſe att the dore, to whome the S. ſent a legge of the capon: the poore man tooke it and with a malicious and diabolicall eye beheld it, and kept itA legge of a capō changed into a fish in the bāds of a poore man that would ſcandalize S.

                  THE LXXXXI. CHAPTER.
                  HAuing bin many dayes blinde, as, by reaſon of the great infirmity of his eyes which his wepinges had procured him, it often happened; he determined for his conſolation to viſitt Brother Bernard, one of his firſt companions and inward freindes, and to remayne ſome time with him, to talke of God. But comming to his cell on the toppe of the mountaine, and finding it ſhutt, he thought he was in prayer, as indeed he was, and hauing no meane to ſee him, he called him by theſe wordes: Open Bernard, and come comfort this poore blind mā, and many times reiterating the ſame, &amp; the Religious not anſwearing, he was much diſquieted, and ſaid to his companion: I haue called him many times, &amp; he will not anſweare me, lett vs goe in the name of God: and ſo departing iudged Brother Bernard to be proud: and neuertheles conſidering better that it was not his couſtume ſo to doe, he tourned from his companion, and fell to prayer, where he was not long but he heard anſweare from God, who reprehending him, ſaid: Litle man, why doeſt thou trouble they ſelfe ſo much, doeſt thou thinck it reaſonable to leaue the Creatour for the creature? when thou calledſt Brother Bernard; he was with me, not with him ſelfe, and therfore he could not anſweare thee; for he did not heare thee. Which S. Francis hearing he humbled him ſelfe to God and asked him pardon.
                  
                     What penance S. Franc. did for an ill thought he had of one of his Brethren. Then incontinently retourning directly to Brother Bernard, he mett him without his cell, hauing ended his prayer: and as Brother Bernard fell att his feet, he likewiſe fell at his; and acknowledged his fault of the ill iudgement he had conceaued of him: then required of him to enioyne him this pennance: I will, ſaid he, that thou ſett they feet on my throat, and on my mouth, and treading hard theron ſhalt ſay: Poore worme, the ſonne of Peter Benardone, there lye one the earth, ſith thou haſt ſo exalted thee in pride, bafe and abiect as thou art: which poore Brother Bernard hearing, he would in no ſort yeld ther to, till the holy Father commanded him in vertue of obedience, and then with the greateſt modeſty and reuerence he could poſsibly, he obeyed, firſt conditioned that the S. ſhould in like ſort doe to him what he would; and ſo hauing obeyed the S. he reciprocally commanded him very ſharply to reprehend him for euery fault of his he ſhould know, as often as they ſhould meete together. Thus did the Religious Saints of thoſe dayes exerciſe themſelues in humility. But S. Fracis hearing that, was in ſuch ſort afflicted for hauing promiſed him obedience, for the great reuerence he had towardes

him, aſwell for his great worthynes, as becauſe he was the firſt of his Order, as that he reſolued rather to forbeare his ſweet and gratious cō
                     uerſation, then to haue ſubiect to reprehend him, though in ſuch a ſeruant of God there were litle or nothing to reprehend.
                  A Religious that had care of a leaper, comming with him to our Lady of Angels, the S. reprehended him for hauing brought him thither, with trouble and afliction, which he had ſcarcely vttered but, thinking that he had offended the leaper in reprehending the Religious in his preſence, he preſently went and acknowledged his fault vnto his Vicaire▪
                     S. Franc. did eat pottage with a leaper for pennance in that he thought he had ſcandalized him. of whome he demanded for pennace, that he would enioyne him to eat with the leaper in one ſame diſh, who not to giue him diſcontent was conſtrained ſo to command him; and ſo there was incōtinently brought a diſh of pottage from the kitchen, for the leaper and himſelfe: it was admirable to ſee with what patience and taſt this worthy ſeruant of God endeauoured to eat of the pottage in which the leaper putt his finges, which being all couered with the loathſome infection of his leapry, the droppes of putrefaction ran into the diſh; which cauſed in the Religious there preſent an extreame hart-greife and compaſsion, that their Father without offence ſhould performe ſo bitter and intollerable a penance. Lett this be ſpoaken to our confuſion, that ſeeke ſo many curious arts to ſeaſon our meates, which we deſire to haue ſo delicious. The ſaid Religious did aſſuredly affirme, that as often thence-forward ae they remembred that refection of their Father with the leaper, all meat how delicate ſoeuer it might be, made their hart ariſe, and was diſdayned of them.
               
               
                  Of the new and notable Matines of holy humility, which S. Francii and Brother Leo did ſing hauing no Breuiary to read them.
                  THE LXXXXII. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father being one time in the hermitage with Brother Leo, he went ſo farre from the celle, that the night preuented them, and hauing no Breuiary with them, the houre of MatinesS. Franc. aſsured of his ſaluatiō. being come, S. Francis ſaid to the Brother: will not yee that we employ this time vnprofitably? that therfore we paſſe it in the prayſe of God, ſay as I ſhall tell you: but take heed that you chaunge not any word; I then will ſay: O Francis thou haſt committed ſo many ſinnes in the world, that thou deſerueſt hell; and you ſhall anſweare me, you ſay the truth, that you deſerue a place in the deepeſt part of hell. Brother Leo, moſt humble and obedient, promiſed him to ſay ſo: but as the S. began to vtter the foreſaid wordes, Brother Leo anſweared. Know

Brother Franc. that you ſhal not goe to hel, but to the glory of Paradice. Which the holy Father admiting, he commanded him againe not to ſay ſo, but as now I ſhall tell thee: I will begin to ſay, Francis thou haſt ſo much offended God, that thou well deſerueſt to be eternally accurſed, and you ſhall anſweare, without any variation: thou art doubtles worthy to be foreuer expelled from the face of God: which the good Brother Leo promiſing to obſerue, the holy Father with a loud and fearefull voice, knocking his breſt, began: O God lord of heauen &amp; earth, I haue committed ſo many offences againſt thy diuine Maieſty, that I am well aſſured, I meritt to be eternally baniſhed thy glory and perpetually damned: and Brother Leo anſweared: God will accept thee for ſuch an one, as among the great multitude of his elect thou ſhalt be eſpecially bleſſed and glorious in his celeſtiall kingdome. S. Francis more admiring then before, in that he knew how obedient Brother Leo was, he ſaid: why doe you not anſweare me, as I enioyned you, and as you promiſed me? I now command you in vertue of obedience, that when I ſay: O wretched and miſerable Francis doeſt thou thinck euer to deſerue pardon of the God of mercies, hauing alwayes ſo much offended him? thou art not worthy of grace: I command you, I ſay, to anſweare me: thou in no ſort deſerueſt the mercie of God. But albeit Brother Leo promiſed him, yet did he neuertheles anſweare him: God the Father whoſe mercy is infinite, and infinitly greater then our ſinnes, will giue you his grace, accompayned with moſt ſinguler giftes,
                  The holy Father therfore halfe angry, ſaid vnto him: Brother Leo, why would you not giue me cōtentement in ſo reaſonable a demande, and why haue we thus miſpriſed the precept of obedience? Brother Leo falling proſtrate on the earth, humbly anſweared him: God knoweth that I alwayes purpoſed to obey you, but he would haue me ſpeake according to his will, and not according to yours. The S. herewith not fully ſatisfied, replyed, and with inſtance ſaid: I beſeech you, my deere child, to comfort me att leaſt for this once: and when you ſhall heare me to accuſe myſelfe, anſweare me that I am not worthy of mercy; Brother Leo anſweared him: Father, if it lye in me, for your ſatisfaction I will moſt willingly doe it: S. Francis then all bathed in teares, with a loud voice cryed out: Ingratefull wretch, doeſt thou thinck euer to finde pardon att Goddes handes; and Brother Leo incontinently anſweared: Father thou ſhall finde it, and ſhalt beſides obtaine ſo many ſpeciall graces of God, that he will exalt thee on earth and in heauē (then he added:) pardō me, Father, if my power hath not bin to ſpeake otherwiſe, as you deſired, for God ſpeaketh by my mouth; thus did they ſpend the night, &amp; in other like exerciſes, wherin God did apparētly manifeſt how gratefull vnto him is humility, as alſo the true miſpriſe of ones ſelfe.
               
               
                  
                  How S. Francis prepared himſelfe to prayer, and what conditions be that prayeth ought to haue.
                  THE LXXXXIII. CHAPTER▪
                  
                  SIth we haue ſpoaken of the holy Fathers Marines, it ſeemeth now conuenient time, to make ſome mention of his ſo perfect prayer▪ Mine opiniō is that there is no place more proper to ſpeake therof, then after the deſcription of his great humility, whereon as on a firme ſtone, and true foundation, prayer, to haue it penetrate euen to heauen, ought to be builded. Wherfore he merited to obtaine all theThe firſt condition of prayer to knowe ones own miſery. 3. Reg. 8. conditions requiſite to a true and worthy prayer; the firſt wherof, is the knowledge of ones owne miſery, according to Salomon, when he ſaith: O liuing God, if any one acknowledgeing the wound of his hart to witt, his ſinnes, doth lift his handes to thee in this thy temple, heare him. Now who hath more perfectly knowne himſelfe? who hath more clearly confeſſed his fault, and who hath more humbly diſcouered it to God and men, then this glorious S. Therefore▪ alſo were his prayers admitted before the preſēce of God, who fixeth his eyes on thePſal. 101. Iudith 9. humble, and reiecteth not their pious prayers, as the Prophett ſaith. The deuout Iudith, affirmeth the ſame, ſaying: My God the prayers of the humble are alwayes pleaſing vnto thee.
                  
                  
                     The 2. to keep the ſoule ſeparated from terreſtriall thinges, and eleuated vnto God Matt. 6. The ſecond condition of prayer, is to keepe the ſoule euer ſeparated from terreſtriall thinges, and eleuated vnto God, as ſaith Iſodorus: If the ſoule will be illuminated with ſpirituall light, ſhe muſt precedently purge her ſelfe of the filth of worldly cogitations, and ſo ſhe may be neat and pure before her God. That prayer is pure, which is made without any mixture of worldly thoughtes, and that impure where the ſpiritt is employed in terreſtriall thinges. And therfore, IESVS CHRIST, leauing vs the forme of perfect prayer, ſaith: When thou ſhalt pray, enter into thy camber in ſecrett, that thou mayeſt leaue out all care excepting only of ſpeaking with God: ſhutt the dore of thy hart, that nothing enter in, to robbe his ſubſtance: call thy ſoule, and make her be in her ſelfe, without any diſtraction, and attentiue in God, and then thy prayer ſhalbe perfect before God, and thou ſhalt be heard. The holy Father S. Francis performed the ſame, for he ſo reiected all other care of the world to transforme himſelfe into God, that he had no remembranceThe 3. cō
                        dition is compaſſion. of himſelfe or of his worldly affaires. And therfore moſt commonly when he prayed, his body was eleuated into the aire, hauing nothing in it that could poiſe it downe to the earth.
                  God teacheth vs the third condition of prayer, by his Prophet Iſaie,

ſaying. Giue thy bread to the hungry, and thy coat to him that is naked
                     Iſai. 21. 
                     and releiue each one in his neceſsities: then offer thy prayers to God, and he will heare thee, call him by this meane, and he will come vnto thee. On the contrary, he that ſhutteth his eares to the demaund of the poore, when in his neceſsity, he ſhall crye to God, he will not heare him. This piety and compaſsion was ſuch and ſo great in S. Francis, that he abſolutely gaue or beſtowed, his only coate, occaſion preſenting, yea, which is the moſt that may be, he deſired to giue entierlie himſelfe, for the only loue of God, as is formerlie alleadged. In regard of this extreme charitie towardes the poore, and for his example vnto the world, he alſo merited to be ſo interiourly affected of his God.
                  The fourth conditiō of prayer neceſſary to a Chriſtian, is to giue goodThe 4. condition is to harken vnto God. Prou. 28. eare to God, if we deſire to be heard of his diuine Maieſty. for God will abhorre the prayers of him, ſaith the Sage, that hath not eares to heare his holy commandements: therfore the ſinner hath no cauſe to complaine that God doth not heare him, becauſe himſelfe did not firſt heare God: and if he heare him in one only thing, or two, or three, he proueth deafe in all the reſt. And therefore, on the other ſide, one Pater noster, or one Aue Maria, of a Chriſtian fearing God, is with greater reaſon heard, then a thouſand of a vicious and diſobedient perſon: the holy Father S. Francis obeyd God in ſuch degree of perfection that hauing called him by his grace, he did not only labour to accompliſh his diuine preceptes, but euen the Counſailes of his ghoſpell, without omitting the leaſt point: therefore alſo did God afterward graciously graunt him what he demaunded, ſo farre foorth as he permitted other creatures to obey him.
                  The fift condition is, that he that prayeth doe alſo ſeparate himſelfeThe 5. is to be ſeparated from worldly conuerſation for euer. S. Bernard. Matt. 26. Iohn. 18. from the conuerſation of the world, not only when he would pray, but euen alwayes, if he will pray perfectly, and that he ſequeſter him ſelfe into ſome deſert and ſolitary place, if he will that his ſoule be alwayes diſpoſed worthely to pray vnto God: The contemplatiue Father S. Bernard, ſpeaking by experience ſaith: If the world delight thee, thou ſhalt euer be impure: Our Lord IESVS CHRIST hath alſo left vs example hereof, for he often went vp to the mountaine, and left his beſt beloued diſciples, to vnite himſelfe alone to his Father; So this glorious Sainct found himſelfe ſo much more gratified by the communication of the holy Ghoſt, as he was farther eſtranged from the rumours of the world, and farther ſequeſtred into ſolitary places, wherin, he was ſo farre from being ſubdued by cogitations of the world, and by the infections therof, that he obtayned notable victories againſt the deuill.

He ſhunned ſenſuall light, as diſtractiue vnto the hart, and hauing giuen ſome repoſe vnto his body in the beginning of the night, he ſpent the reſt in moſt deepe ſilence, &amp; in high contentment with his beloued God. The ſixt condition of perfect prayer, is, a feruent charity towardsThe 6. is ardent charity. God, without all feare, not like vnto that of the cold▪ negligent, and new beginners; for this perfect charity expelling all baſe feare and labour, doth by loue vnite the hart of man with the goodnes of God. This loue was ſuch in the holy Father, that it continuallie burned in his hart, as a liuing fire, the flame wherof dilated it ſelfe in charity, to the benefitt of his neighbour, through all the partes of the world.
               
               
                  Of the perſeuerance of his prayer, and of the effect it wrought, and continued in S. Francis.
                  THE XCIV. CHAPTER.
                  
                     The 7. condition of prayer, is perſeuerance therein. Luc. 18. THe ſeauenth condition is perſeuerance therin, becauſe God ſaith we muſt alwayes pray, and not ceaſſe. Of this point it may be alleadged that the life of S. Francis was a continuall prayer vnto God, either for his owne ſaluation or his neighbours, deſiring to communicate his Redeemer IESVS CHRIST vnto all Creatures, that they might know and loue him, as he did, and that for his owne part, he might euer dwell with his diuine Maieſtie▪ But being, by the impediment of the weight of his terreſtriall body that was a ſtranger and remote from his true country, diſabled to enioy his beloued, he, by perſeuerant prayer endeauoured with all poſsiblity, to keepe his ſoule alwayes vnited vnto him, which was not ouer-difficult vnto him, as hauing ſo mortified in himſelfe earthly afflictions, that he conuerſed in ſpiritt on high with the bleſſed, as a Cittizen of heauen, and familier in the houſe of God. Therfore prayer was vnto him a ſinguler refreſhment in his labours, an aſſured fortreſſe againſt temptations, and a remedy in neceſsities: for diſtruſting himſelfe, and his proper forces, induſtry, and knowledge, he had ſetled and repoſed all his hope in God, by meane of prayer, which he affirmed that euery faithfull Chriſtian ought aboue all other things to demaund of God in this life, conſidering that without it, one can make noFeruour of S. Fr. in prayer profitt nor progreſſe in ſpirituall life: and therfore, to be an example vnto his Religious, he made alwayes to appeare exteriourly and interiourly, that trauailing or praying, being in action, or rerepoſing,

his ſpiritt was continually attentiue vnto prayer. And therfore it ſeemed that he had not only dedicated his ſoule and body vnto his beloued God: but euen the very momentes of time, to the end that no viſitation of the holy Ghoſt ſhould by his negligence paſſe, and be loſt, as not finding him diſpoſed to receaue it. Therefore when in his iorney he felt the ſame, he would ſtay and lett his companion paſſe on, to know with a very deep attention, what God inſpired vnto him. And when he was in ſolitary places, he filled the mountaines with ſighes, and bathed the earth with a flud of teares, he beat his breſt for the offences committed againſt his God. Sometimes he accuſed himſelfe as if he had bin before a Iudge, other times he demaunded mercy as a child, of his gracious Father: ſometimes he ſweetlie diſcourſed as if he had bin priuately with his intimous freind: he hath att ſuch time bin heard of his Religious to inuocate the clementie of God, by the great commiſeration which he felt in himſelfe of the death and paſsion of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, as if he had ſeene him crucified. He ſhewed exteriour geſture conformable to the interiour effect. Sometimes he held his mouth againſt the earth, now he was on his knees, then vpright on his feet, now he held his armes croſſed, then his handes ioyned towardes heauen. And praying after this manner, he was moſt commonlie ſeene enuirouned with a great light, and lifted into the aire in teſtimony of the interiour light and affection towardes God, and then did he participate of the diuine ſecrettes, which he neuer reuealed, but when it was requiſite: for he ordinarily ſaid, that one did often looſe an ineſtimable treaſure, for a very baſe price offending the giuer, &amp; with daunger neuer to haue it againe. For which cauſe when he retourned from his exerciſes, he in ſuch ſort compoſed and diſſembled his countenance, that he that had not much experienced it, would neuer haue ſuſpected that he had prayed in ſuch exceſſe of ſpirit. When he prayed with his Religious, he retayned his ſighes and all other geſtures: wherby he might be obſerued. He taught the manner to pray ſecretlie, then to ſay: My God I recommend vnto thee this conſolation which it hath pleaſed thee without any meritt of mine to graunt me: to the end I ſteale not this great treaſure. He aſſured them that by this meane they ſhould obtaine that God inuiting them, would ſay: Freind becauſe thou haſtLuc. 14. bin ſo humble aſcend now vnto an higher place.
               
               
                  
                  Of the attention which S. Francis had in his prayers, and of the deuotion he had in diuine ſeruice.

                  HE ſaid the canonicall houres with ſo great reuerence and deuotion, that albeit he were moſt commonly weary and feeble by reaſon of his infirmities: yet making no eſteeme thereof, he was alwayes ſtanding or kneeling with his head bare, reading verie diſtinctly. If he trauiled when the time of prayer and ſaying the ſaidThe reasō which S. Franc. gaue of his attē
                        tion. houres was, he would ſtay. This practiſe did he neuer omitt whatſoeuer rayne or ſtorme did happen, ſaying: If the body that is to be food for wormes, deſired to eat in repoſe, with how much more reaſon ought one to giue repoſe to the ſoule, when ſhe receaueth the refection of the life which ſhe is eternally to poſſeſſe without corruption? He ſaid his pſalmes and what ſoeuer was to be ſaid with ſuch attention, as if God had bin before his eyes. When he was to name the name of God, he pronounced it ſo ſweetly, that he ſeemed to lick his l
                        •
                     ppes, ſuch contentment felt he in his ſoule: yea he commanded his Religious carefullie to gather vp all the papers they found wherin was written the name of IESVS: that it might not be troddē vnder foot. He reputedWith what purity S. Francis ſerued God. it a great offence, when one ſpake vnto God, to thincke of other matters. And if he chaunced ſometimes to apply his ſpiritt on other▪ affaires, though ſpirituall, he would accuſe himſelfe thereof in confeſsion; yea albeit he had his interiour powers ſo recollected within him by meane of the continuall and aſsiduous exerciſe therin employed, that the flyes of the world moleſted him very ſeldome.
                  Being one lent att an hermitage he attempted for exerciſe to make an oſier basket, but the time of prayer being come, becauſe in ſaying the third houre, the basket came to his minde, he tooke it and incontinentlie threw it into the fire with theſe wordes: I ſacrifice thee vntoHow he once celebrated the natiuity &amp; with what new feruour. God, in place of his ſeruice which thou haſt interrupted.
                  This glorious Sainct, held the feaſt of the natiuity of our Sauiour in particuler deuotion. Being on a time neere vnto the citty of Grecio, he determined to celebrate that feaſt after a new manner, therby to ſtirre vp the deuotiō of the faithful: &amp; hauing therfore, to auoid ſcādal, obtayned permiſsion of the Pope, he cauſed a great ſtable to be prepared in an old houell, where he cauſed to be putt hay and a manger, then brought thither an oxe and an aſſe, and aſſembled ſo many of his Religious, that they neere exceeded the inhabitantes of the place. But becauſe he had

publiſhed the ſolemnity, all the inhabitantes of the neighbour places flocked thither as who ſhould be foremoſt, with flutes, cornettes, and other ruſticall inſtrumentes, ſo that all the mountaines thereabout gaue ecchoe to their harmony, they ceaſſed not all night to ſound and reioyce before that ſtable, wherin S. Francis and a great nomber of his Religious prayed before three images of wood, that repreſented our lord IESVS CHRIST, the Virgin Mary and S. Ioſeph, before which images were lightened a great quantity of lightes that were with curious art exquiſitelie ſett foorth. S. Francis read the ghoſpell atr the midinght Maſſe, then preached to the people with ſuch tendernes of hart, that when he would vtter the name of IESVS, he could not but called him the litle child of Bethleem. This feaſt was not ſpēt without fruit for a famous gentleman named Iohn of Grecio, forſaking the cheualry and nobilitie of the world and the pompes therof, became very familier vnto S. Francis and an imitatour of him, becauſe he had ſeene him in viſion that night with a child in his armes who ſeemed to sleep, and whome he ſweetly awakened. The hay that was taken from that ſtable cured manie diſeaſed beaſtes, yea verie manie men; whence may be iudged that God had ſingulerlie aſsiſted that deuotion of his ſeruant.
               
               
                  How S. Francis cauſed the oratories of Bis Religious to be accommodated: and of the care he had of their enterteynement.
                  THE LXXXXVI. CHAPTER.
                  THis holy Father laboured exceedingly to haue his Religious know the meane which they ought to vſe to pray well, that being free frō all worldly employmentes, they might apply thē
                     ſelues to prayer and contēplation, as a fountaine that drowneth diſordinate thirſtes, and on the contrary filleth and ſatisfieth the ſoule with a ſpirituall taſt of diuine graces. And that the ſaid Religious might more commodiously emploie themſelues therin, he would haue their Oratories ſequeſtred frō the bruit and tumult of the people, that they might auoyd diſtraction: and therfore he cauſed thē to be made in the middes of woodes and foreſtes with bowes of trees and wreathed with ruſhes, where they ſpent their lentes entierlie in faſtinges and prayers. And that the care of temporall affaires might not choake the grace of the ſpiritt, nor the cogitations of worldlie neceſsities procure them impediment, he committed to one Brother alone, when the number of Religious permitted, the chardge of the dore, the kitchen, and larder, appointing all the other Religious to obſerue the Order following.
                  
                     
All the morning they were to remayne retired in prayer in the diuine offices, and very ſtrictly obſeruing ſilence, till the Officer att the ordinary houre warned them to dinner, which he did by knocking on a tile: for their pouerty afforded not them a bell. But he knowing that man cōſiſted of a body and ſoule, it was neceſſary the body ſhould be mayntayned to ſuſtaine the ſoule in the ſeruice of God: he accuſtomed to goe into the kitchen, where if he ſaw nothing to begin their refection, he would goe into the garden and thence bring a bundle of hearbes which he would mildly deliuer the Cooke, to haue dreſt for the Religious. When the Cooke had egges &amp; cheeſe▪ gotten by begging, the holy Father in time conuenient would eat therof very merily, to encourage others, and would commend the prudence of the Cook. But if he exceeded, he would reprehend him for the exceſſe, and command him to giue nothing to the Religious the day following, which was performed: though moſt commonly they ſett themſelues att table to eat nothing but dry bread pourchaced by begging, which they did eat with exceeding contentment as a gift receaued of God, it hauing bin demaunded for his ſake: Becauſe our Sauiour worthely ſayth: Man liueth not

Francis commanded them for the neceſsityes of the houſe. Then att the houre of Euenſong &amp; Compline, they all retourned to accuſtomed prayer in their Church, and other places there vnto deputed.
               
               
                  Of the efficacie of the prayer of the Sainct.
                  THE LXXXXVII. CHAPTER.
                  OF the humilitie of hart of S. Francis, did grow a diffidence of his force and knowledge, a perfect confidence in the diuine pietie, which cauſed that he did neither deſire nor beginne any thing, but he would firſt in prayer demaund of God that he would pleaſe to inſpire him to thincke and excute his will, wherbie he did obtaine ſinguler graces for himſelfe and others. Att the beginning of his conuerſion, being yet in the world, he obtayned that matters of difficultie (according to the world) as to ſerue leapers, and to pardon iniuries ſhould appeare eaſy and pleaſing vnto him, ſo that he had in ſhort time obtayned by prayer that, which he could not haue attayned by tedious exerciſe. The Euangelicall perfection was reuealed vnto him;

and what the Religious ſhould doe in thriſe opening the Miſſall: his rule was approued by Pope Innocent the third, he knew that the will of God was he ſhould aſsiſt to the ſauing of ſoules. Our lord ſpake to him in the Crucifix, &amp; in diuers other manners reuealing vnto him what he ſhould doe: he ſubdued the aſſaultes and embuſhes prepared againſt him by the artifice of the deuils, who fled when they could no longer reſiſt him. It were not poſsible to recount by order all the graces which by prayer he obtayned of God: for beſide the aforeſaid, there remaine manie other to relate, of which we will here inſert ſome few and the reſt in place conuenient.
                  The biſhop of Aſsiſium becomming verie familier vnto S. Francis, and often viſiting him att S. Marie of Angels, goeing one time vnto his celle, he found the dore thruſt to, and in a manner ſhutt: therefore goeing neere and hearing no noyſe, he thought he might be rauiſhed in extaſie in his prayer: which made him deſire to ſee the manner there of: and to that end verie curiouslie opened the dore ſo wide as he might thruſt in his head, which putting further to ſee him, he was ſurpriſed with a great trembling, and ſuch a feare, that he could not breath nor reſpire: and was miraculouslie throwne farre from the celle and loſt his ſpeech, wherwith he was ſo terrified, that he had ſcarce the force to retourne where the Religious were, to whome, hauing recouered his ſpeech, he preſentlie acknowledged his fault in his preſumptious enterpriſe. Thenceforward he much more reuerentlie reſpected ſainct Francis hen before.
                  The Abbott of S. Iuſtin in the dioceſe of Peruſia, meeting him one day, alighted off his mule for the great deuotion he had vnto him, and embraced him, diſcourſing a long time of certaine affaires: att their parting he beſought the S. to pray for him, which he promiſed: and ſo being ſeparated, S. Francis withdrew himſlfe from his companion ſaying that he muſt pay the dept which he would performe to the benefitt of the Abbott, who in the ſame inſtant that S. Francis prayed for him, felt himſelfe as it were rapt out of himſelfe by an extraordinarie feruour which ouer-paſt, he knew right well the vertue and efficacie of the prayer of the Sainct, and afterward related the ſame to diuers.
                  Brother Macie an other time ſaw S. Francis pray in ſuch ſort that there ſeemed liuelie flames to iſſue out of his mouth and eyes, and ſo entierlie enflamed he went vnto him and calling him thriſe, he ſaid: Ah! ah! Brother Macie come to me: wheratt he amazed att ſuch an exceſſe of ſpiritt, caſt himſelfe into his armes, and S. Francis lifted him vp into the aire the hight of a launce: and afterward he recounted vnto the Religious that in that inſtant he felt ſuch and ſo great ſweetnes, that he neuer after felt the like.
                  
                     
Paſsing by the Bourough of S. Sepulchre, by reaſon of his infirmities riding on an aſſe, he was almoſt ſtifled by the extreme concourſe of people that flocked thither to kiſſe his feet, coate▪ handes and his habit: whereat he remayned ſo immoueable that he ſeemed rather an image then a man. Being paſt the Bourough, and not one of thoſe people neere him, he demaunded of his companions, how farre he had yet to the Bourough: whereby they knew that being rauiſhed in ſpiritt vnto heauen, he had not felt that extreme preſſe of people. The ſaid Fathers affirmed that the ſame happened not vnto him once only, but diuers times, by reaſon of the great exceſſe of ſpiritt which was ordinarily incident vnto him.
               
               
                  How by prayer he obtayned of God what he would.
                  THE XCVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THough God alone, who endued him with ſo many graces, is able to expreſſe them, yet we muſt not forbeare to relate thoſe that haue bin committed vnto vs by writting. Goeing to an hermitage there to ſpend one of his lentes, and being vnable, by reaſon of his great infirmities, to goe one foote, he borrowed an aſſe of a poore man, who of deuotion would alſo goe with him. The ſeaſon being extreme hoat on the barren and ſharpe mountaines, he had a great thirſt, and ſuch as he feared to dye therof: and being no longer able to endure it, he acquainted the S. therwith, who moued with compaſsion, alighted off his aſſe, and on his knees proſtrated himſelfe before God, and praying, did not ariſe till he was heard, then ariſing, he ſaid to the poore man: Goe to yonder ſtone, and by the vertue of God, it will yeld thee water ſufficientlie. He went thither, found water, and quenched his thirſt: which done, the fountaine ſhutt againe, to make it more manifeſt that by the only m

                     rittes of the S. God had made the water to iſſue out of an hard rock
                        •
                     , as he did for Moyſes.
                  
                     S. Franc▪ obtayned of God that a couetous man became liberall. The holy Father being att Spoletum, a lay Brother called Brothre Andrew of Sienna that went a begging, reported vnto him that there was a Bourgeſſe that had litle feare of God, of whome he could neuer gett an almoſe: whereto he anſweared, that he ſhould endeauour to gett were it but one onlie loafe of him, and ſhould bring it vnto him. The ſaid Religious went vnto him, and was ſo troubleſome in demaunding, that att lenght by importunity he gott a loafe. Hauing it, he carryed the ſame to S. Francis, who deuided it into litle morcels, and thereof gaue to each of the Religious with condition, that they ſhould all ſay a Pater and

an Aue for the auaricious, man: and himſelfe ioyning with them to pray vnto God, they obtayned that this extreme nigard became liberall; God permitting him to know his fault, in ſuch ſort that thenceforward there was none more liberall vnto them then he.
                  
                     A gentleman became Freer Minour by the prayers of S. Francis. A vertuous gentleman did often inuite the holy Father vnto his houſe, where he extended ſo much charity vnto him, that caſting his affection on him, he much deſired to haue him of his Order, and to that effect he prayed God that he would voutſafe to illuminate this his freind to leaue the world: which he did with ſuch feruour, that being in extaſie he was eleuated into the aire, whiles it chaunced that the ſaid gentleman paſsing by, ſaw him ſo in the aire, and God with him: who ſeemed to graunt him this grace, being therefore conuerted and touched by God, he entred into the Order.
                  Paſsing by the forreſt of Cortone, a Lady of worth came before him and demaunded his benediction: which he hauing giuen her, ſhe began to recount vnto him the miſerable eſtate wherin ſhe then was, to witt, that God hauing long time before inſpired her to ſerue him, ſhe had a husband ſo contrary to that her good intention, and ſuch an ennemy to their faluation, that therby ſhe liued in perpetuall anguiſh. And therfore ſhe prayed him for the loue of God to aſsiſt her. The holy Father anſweared her, woman haue faith in God, for he knowing your holy and pious intention, will accompliſh your deſire. Goe therefore to your houſe, and boldly vſe theſe wordes vnto your husband: I tell you in the behalfe of God, that now is the time of mercie, and the time of iuſtice will come hereafter. And therfore, by the woundes of our redeemer IESVS CHR. crucified, I pray you ſo to diſpoſe, that we may liue in the peace and feare of God, and you ſhall ſee, ſaid S. Francis, that he will heare you: the woman left himBy the counſaile &amp; prayer of S. Fr. a gentleman was cōuerted from the world to God. and his companion in prayer, and ſhe in the meane time went away full of conſolation. The ſucceſſe was admirable, for comming to her lodgeing, her husband asked her whence ſhe came, ſhe recounted vnto him all by order, and on the part of God vſed vnto him the wordes S. Francis had taught her, wherewith he became ſo mild, that he ſeemed not the man he accuſtomed to be; and in deed, anſweared his wife that he was reſolued thenceforward to chaunge his life, and to ſerue God as ſhe deſired. Whereto, his wife replyed: ſith it pleaſeth you thus to obey God, it ſeemeth requiſite that we beginne the ſame by a vow of chaſtity, it is a vertue exceeding gratefull vnto God, and wilbe very meritorious vnto vs, the husband was content therwith, and ſo they after liued

piously. This conuerſion gaue a merueilous admiration to all thoſe that knew them, and much more, when hauing perſeuered piously together, they alſo dyed in one ſame day, the wife in the morning, and the husband att night, ſhe as a morning ſacrifice, and he as a ſacrifice of the euenning: God permitting that according well on earth, they ſhould, by the merittes of the prayer of his ſeruant, be alſo vnited in heauen, leauing to the inhabitantes of that place, a perpetuall memory of ſo worthy a miracle.
               
               
                  Of certaine appariſsions made vnto S. Francis in his contemplation.
                  THE XCIX. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Francis alwayes ſought ſolitary places, wherrin he might more freelie conuerſe with God, and diſcourſe with his Angels; and there making his celle of bowes of trees, diſtant from thoſe of the other Religious, he enioyned Brother Leo his companion, to viſitt him no more then once a day, and to bring him only bread and water, and once in the night att the houre of Matines; and att his comming, to ſay: Domine Labia 
                           •

                        ciabit laudem tuam, then he ſhould enter to ſay matines with him: but if he anſweared not he ſhould depart in peace: becauſe, he was ſometime ſo rauiſhed in extaſie, that he could not ſpeake, day nor night▪ Brother Leo very ſeriously obſerued the commandement of the holy Father, neuertheles he ſometime watched him for his conſolation: he oftentimes ſaw him eleuated into the aire, and then he boldly embraced his feet when they were low enough to doe it: for att ſuch time he was lifted higher then a great tree, and att other times ſo high that the eye of man could not attaine the ſight of him▪ which when Brother Leo ſaw, he would fall on his knees vnder him, and aske mercy of God.
                  This Religious 
                        ••
                     counted that he ſaw him once on his knees hauing his countenauce fixed towardes heaven and his handes ioyned together, when he heard him vtter theſe wordes, which with great effuſion of teares he often repeated: Who art thou, my God, and who am I? att which wordes he ſaw a light to deſcend on his head, and in the ſame heard a voice that ſpake vnto him: but he could not vnderſtand the wordes, being remote from him for feare the Sainct ſhould perceaue him, and of reuerence, reputing himſelfe, vnworthy to heare the diuine ſecrettes; he only ſaw S. Francis th

Father heard ſome noyſe: and therefore ſayd: I command thee in vertue of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, whoſoeuer thou be, to ſtay there. Brother Leo ſtaying ſaid: Father, it is I. S. Francis, calling him, checked him for it: but Brother Leo acknowledging his fault, prayed him that ſith he had pardonned him, he would alſo ſo much fauour him as to tell him what ſignified the viſion which he had ſeene. The holy Father willing to ſatisfie him, in this manner expounded it vnto him: Know that when you ſaw that light diſcend from aboue, God communicated vnto me the knowledge of his diuine maieſty, and of my ſelfe, which was it that I demaunded of him, ſaying My God, who art thou, and who am I? that is, his greatnes, and worth, and my extreme baſenes, and the very nothing that I am: and therefor I neuer accuſtomed to reiterate thoſe wordes. After this reuelation, I ſaid vnto him, whence is it then, my God, that thou voutſafed ſo to gratifie a worme of the earth, ſuch as my ſelfe, ſo abiect and vile? and he anſweared me ſuch high matters, as humane vnderſtanding is not capable to conceaue them. Before he departed, he demaunded of me to offer him ſome thing, I anſweared, that I had nothing in this world, and that my ſelfe was his, that I had giuen my ſelfe to him for

Franc. ſoretold the impreſsion of the ſtigmates he was to haue. I reputed not mine but his. For this then was it that thou ſaweſt me ſtretch out my hand three ſeuerall times. Now ſith I haue ſatisfied thee I command thee that whiles I ſhall liue, thou diſcouer it to no perſon of the world, and that thou watch me no more when I ſhalbe in prayer. Goe then, with the benediction of God, into your celle, and pray to God for me: for with in few dayes, God will worck ſuch meruaylous thinges in this mountaine, that all the world ſhall admire it. He meant the holy impreſsion of his ſtigmates.
               
               
                  
                  Of an other apparition vnto the holy Father.
                  THE C. CHAPTER.
                  AVery yong and ſimple Religious, being in an Oratory, where the Religious accuſtomed to retire themſelues when they went into the deſert, (S. Francis being then there) and being ſurpriſed by the night, he was to remaine there to take his reſt, and then he determined to ſee that which he had ſo often heard ſpoaken of the holy Father S. Francis, to witt, that when he prayed in the night he did merueilous thinges. Wherefore euery one being gone to reſt, he placed himſelfe att the feet of the holy Father, and that he ſhould not goe away without him, he tied their girdles together, to the end that if he aroſe he might be awakened. But this deuiſe litle auayled: for S. Francis ariſing very gently, looſed the cordes and went to pray otherwhere. The Religious that was a sleepe with his cogitation running on his deſire, was not long from awaking, and finding himſelfe alone and deceaued, purpoſed att aduentures to follow him through the woods: to whome God was ſo fauourable, that he found the holy Father in prayer on the toppe of a Mountaine; and he ſeeming to heare ſome ſpeech, ſaw a merueilous ſplēdour that enuirōned the S. and therin, our lord IESVS CHRIST, with the glorious virgin his mother, S. Iohn the Euangeliſt, and an infinite nūber of Angels that were there preſent: which the Religious ſeeing, he was ſeaſed with ſuch a terrour that he fell as dead to the ground, and had no feeling till the holy Father hauing ended his prayer and retourning to his celle, by reaſon of the darcknes of the night ſtumbled againſt him. So conceauing preſently who he was, embracing him and laying him on his necke the beſt he could and God aſsiſting him, as a good Paſtour he carryed his beloued ſheep to the folde, and hauing reduced him to himſelfe, &amp; made him report what he had ſeene, he likewiſe commaunded him, not to reueale it to any liuing creature, during the time he was as in this world.
               
               
                  Of an other viſion.
                  THE CI. CHAPTER.
                  GOeing one time from one Monaſtery to an other, there was cō
                     mitted vnto him for companion a yong Religious that had no great feare of God. So hauing refreſhed thēſelues in the Monaſtery, whither they went, the S. repayred to his reſt before the others,

that he might riſe to prayer, when the reſt were in their firſt sleepe, as he accuſtomed to doe, and his ſaid companion remayned with the other Religious, to whome murmuring againſt the S. he ſaid, that he did eat, drinck, and sleepe very well, and withall that he was reputed a S. and therfore he reſolued to goe ſee, if he aroſe in the night to pray as the ſaid Religious had aſſured him he did, and to that end, he slept not that night. Att the ſecond watch he perceaued the holy Father to ariſe, who haſtened into a wood thereby, whither the Religious followed his ſteppes very gently. Being come to the place that ſeemed moſt proper, and falling on his knees, he beganne to caſt out his ordinary feruent ſighes and pious enflamed ſpeeches, beſeeching the glorious virgin to ſhew him her ſweet child, in ſuch ſort as ſhe brought him intoA Religious doubting of the purity of life of S. Francis was ſufficiently aſsured therof hauing watched him one night. the world. This prayer ended, the ſaid religious ſaw the holy virgin mother, appeare in a moſt reſplendent light, who comming to the Saint with an admirable benignity deliuered and laid her ſonne in his armes, whome the S. hauing thanckfully receaued, he tenderly embraced, clipped, and kiſſed verie amourously; this infinite contentment and contemplation of the S. continued euen to the breake of day, when he rendred him againe whence he receaued him, then with moſt humble reuerence kneeling on the ground, all the viſion diſappeared. The ſaid Religious was ſo edified by this miracle, that he craued pardon of the S. and chaunged his life. This holy Father had ſuch and the like viſitations of the glorious virgin Mary, of the bleſſed Apoſtles S. Peter and S. Paul and of the glorious Archangell S. Michael, for the particuler deuotion he had vnto them; and they all did exceedingly comfort him; as his Confeſſour and companion Brother Leo, did diuers times heare and ſee.
               
               
                  How the priuiledges which God gaue to the Frere Minors, were by an Angell, declared to their Father S. Francis. This is extracted out of the 26. chapter of the 10. booke, and here ſett in his proper place.
                  THE CII. CHAPTER.
                  
                     Seauen priuiledges which God graunted to the Order of the Freer Minors. SAinct Francis being in the Couent of Sainct Vrbin, the Angel of God appeared vnto him, who reuealed vnto him the ſinguler priuiledges and graces which God had graunted to them that obſerued his rule, and ſhould die in his Order. The firſt priuiledge is, that if their intention be good, they ſhall in althinges be gouerned by the holie Ghoſt. The ſecond, that in this deſert of their pilgrimage, they ſhalbe particulerly defended in their temptations from the ſnares of their ennemies and frō the pitt of mortall ſinnes. The third that they ſhalbe ſo purged here, that the paines of Purgatory ſhalbe no ſtoppe

to their ſpeedy paſſadge to the glory which God hath prepared them. The fourth, that they who ſhall follow their rule with fidelity and feruour, ſhall meritt to heare and obtaine that which was promiſed to the Apoſtles of God, and afterward enioyed by them, when he ſaid: yee that haue left althinges to ſerue me, ſhall ſitt on ſeates, and ſhallMatt. 19. iudge others. The fift, that God ſhall giue them increaſe of the goodes of this life and of grace, who ſhall haue particuler deuotion to the Order and to the Religious therof in releuing them, and ſhall afterwardes if they perſeuer, make them heires of his glorie. The ſixt is that they on the contrary, who ſhall perſecute the Order, and not repent, their life ſhalbe ſhort, or if they liue, it ſhalbe in afflictions and maledictions of God, and after their death ſhalbe damned. The ſeauenth, that this rule ſhall endure euen to the end of the world, and that temporall prouiſion ſhall neuer faile the Profeſſors therof, that likewiſe therin ſhalbe alwayes Religious of good and pious life, and zealous of the honour of God and Religion.
               
               
                  Of the continuall exerciſes which S. Francis vſed of the paſsion of Ieſus Chriſt.
                  
                  THE CIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe principall of all the exerciſes of deuotion wherin S. Francis ordinarily employed his ſoule, was the paſsion of our lord IESVS CHRIST, which was ſo engrauen interiourlie within his hart, euen from the beginning of his conuerſion, that as often as he remembred the ſame, he could not forbeare to weep, and therfore he ſo loued the bleſſed croſſe, that if it might be euer truelie ſaid, that any one hath faithfullie carryed it after God, he hath bin one, and doubtleſſe the ſame, in ſhunning all temporall conſolations, ſeeking and finding all kinde of affliction in this world, to ſuffer with IESVS CHRIST. He was alſo, by meanes of his continual prayers, abſtinences, watchinges, and pilgrimages, become very diſeaſed and infirme: for he was ſubiect to the head-ache, greife of the eyes, and of the lunges: notwithſtanding he omitted not the pious worckes that cauſed thoſe infirmities. He had no care to be cured therof, excepting his eyes for the benefitt of his neighbour, that he might ſuffer in his infirmities with his God: ſuch was the interiour and perfect loue, which he bare to his moſt holy paſsion for which, euery thing that to vs ſeemeth carnallie bitter, was to him ſpiritually exceeding pleaſant.
                  Being one day tranſported by this dolour of the paſsion of his ſweet IESVS CHRIST, not ſuſpecting to be heard, he cryed out with a loud

voice, as if he had then ſeen him die: wherevpon a man of honour that feared God, who had bin familier vnto him in the world, paſſed by where the holy Father was, of whome he very inſtantly and as vtterly amazed, demaunded what diſgrace had befallen him, S. Francis with teares anſweared him: I lament and weep for the greiuous tormentes and diſhonours wherwith the barbarous Iewes afflicted my lord IESVSThe great compaſſiō which S. Franc. had of the paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. CHRIST, which I ſo bitterly bewayle in regard that all the world, for whome he hath ſo much endured, ſeemeth to haue forgotten ſo worthy a benefitt. Which vttering, he began to poore out a riuer of teares, in ſuch ſort that the gentleman who came thither to cō
                     fort him, began himſelfe to bewayle the paſsion of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, with his ſeruant Francis.
                  Being one time blinde (which often happened vnto him, and ſometimes euery moneth) through the infirmity of his eyes, a Superiour of his Order demaunded of him, what would follow, ſith he could not read att leaſt ſome ſpirituall booke, by meane wherof he might reioyce his ſpiritt in his infirmity. S. Francis anſweared him: Brother, I alwayes finde ſo much conſolation and ſo much loue in the memory of the life and paſsion of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, that if I ſhould liue till the end of the world, I ſhould need no other leſſon. So that this holy Father carried the goſpell better written in his hart, then is ſeene on paper. Wherfore he often put his Religious in minde of thoſe wordes of Dauid: My ſoule hath reiected conſolation, I haue bin mindefull of
                     Pſal. 76. 
                     God, and haue reioyced: as if he ſaid, that he reſpected no other temporall conſolation, ſith he enioyed all conſolation in the paſsion of his ſweet IESVS CHRIST. And therfore he exhorted his Religious often to tourne the leaues, both night and day, of this pious booke of the paſsion of IESVS CHRIST, without care of any other. And all his ſermons and exhortations were (accordinge to the abondance of his hart) of this croſſe and moſt ſacred paſsion, to perfect them therin, as a moſt aſſured way of ſaluation.
               
               
                  An exhortation of the holy Father S. Francis, to the meditation of the paſsion of our Redeemer Ieſus Chriſt.
                  
                  THE CIV. CHAPTER.
                  BE alwayes mindefull, ſaid the holy Father, of the way of humility and pouerty of the croſſe, wherby our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST hath walked for our example, conſidering that if it were neceſſary for his diuine Maieſty to enter into his glory,Luc. 24. by meane of this his paſsion, it is farre more neceſſary for vs deteſtable

ſinner to tread the ſame path. And if euerie faithfull Chriſtian be obliged therevnto, much more are we, we I ſay, who make profeſsion to follow the croſſe: which God will that we doe not onlie beare, but that by our example and doctrine, we procure others to beare it, and doe induce them after vs, with them to follow him that is our guide: Conſidering withall that the good wil to imitate the paſsion of our Sauiour, is a particuler grace which the holy Ghoſt beſtoweth on the ſoule, that truelie loueth and ſerueth him, for the ſoule that is ſelfe-affected and a freind to her ſelfe doth not taſte, but repugneth this doctrine of the holy Ghoſt, nor reputeth this participation of the paſsion of our Lord, neceſſary to perfection: yet pretending to make greater benefitt by other wayes, not wayes, but hidden downe falles, ſhunning the gall of tribulations, and the bitternes of the croſſe of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, ſhe holdeth her hart drowned and blinded in ſelfe affection, by other naturall and voluntary cogitations, reſting aſſured that ſhe ſerueth God better in that liberty of life, without reſpect of the infinite pleaſures and contentmentes, which the ſoule receaueth interiourly in this contemplation and compaſsion of her God: becauſe they can finde no taſt but in ſuffering for him: but the ſoule purged and entierly exempted from her proper intereſtes, permitteth her ſelfe to be guided by the holy Ghoſt, that he wor
                        •
                     k in her, att his good pleaſure, as an excellent maſter of the ſinguler doctrine which our Lord left written in the bookes of his humility, patience, and paſsion, the infallible wayes of Chriſtian perfection. Therfore the ſoule that obtayneth of him greateſt purity, ſeeketh alſo to transforme herſelfe in to his dolours, reputing all other wayes as mortall food, and this alone for a medicine, bitter vnto the taſt, but right pleaſant in fruit, bitter to taſt, delicious in operation. So preferring health before the taſt, ſhe experienceth how admirable this taſt of eternall life is, to haue reiected the former that is fraile, tranſitory and mortall. For ſhe experienceth that his loue doth not better appeare in any other▪ then in his charitable paſsion, and that the more ſhe transformeth her ſelfe into IESVS CHRIST crucified, the more ſhe is transformed into the high and glorious God, becauſe the humanity cannot be ſeparated from the diuinitie, and himſelfe requireth it as a grace of his Father when he ſaith:Iohn. 17. 12. I will that mine be where I am▪ And ſo the ſoule contemplateth both the one and the other eſtate of her God, that ſhe may neuer be ſeparated from him, as ſhe ſhould be, in ſhunning his paſsion, accordingRom. 8. to the wordes of S. Paul: That he who ſuffereth not with him, ſhall not raigne with him: ſhe therfore conſidereth him mortall &amp; immortall, of which eſtates the one is of them that run the race, the otherIoan. 15. of them that haue already gotten the price. Now as the price is not giuen

but to them that run, ſo heauen is not giuen but to them that cary the croſſe. Neither is it reaſonable that the ſeruant be aboue the Lord, or the diſciple aboue the maſter: therefore we ſee that God communicateth his grace to them that follow him in the aforeſaid māner, and on the cōtrary he taketh it from thoſe preſumptuous who affirme that they will adhere vnto him, by other inuentions, and neuertheles doe neuer leaue themſelues, and in the end alſo they are ſeene erroniously to fall.
               
               
                  How the holy Father knew the will of God to be, that men should exerciſe them ſelues in the paſsion of Ieſus Chriſt.
                  
                  THE CV. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father did not without cauſe affirme the aforeſaid, conſidering that deſiring no other thing then IESVS CHRIST crucified, with S. Paul, and teaching no other vnto his Religious the better to ſecure them and himſelfe, he demaunded of God that he would voutſafe to reueale vnto him, in what exerciſe he and his might appeare moſt acceptable vnto his diuine maieſty: and being inſpired of God, ariſing from his prayer, before the high altar where he was, he tooke the miſſal that lay theron, wherevpon making the ſigne of the croſſe, he began againe to pray vnto God, that he would pleaſe by the opening of that Miſſall, to manifeſt vnto him wherein he was beſt ſerued. Then opening it, he found the paſsion of our Redeemer, and not truſting the firſt time; att the ſecond he found the like, and the third time the ſame: Being thervpon fully encouraged, he prepared himſelfe to ſuffer, and as preſaging what ſhould arriue vnto him, he gaue thanckes vnto God that he would pleaſe to make him participant of his paſsion: ſo that being no longer able to conceale the alacrity of his hart, as drunken with the ſpirit of diuine loue, he ſhewed it exteriourlie, ſinging prayſes vnto God in the Italian tongue, and in French, and often times with two ſtickes, whereof he held the one in forme of a violl on his breaſt, and the other he vſed for a fidle ſtick. But he neuer ended his ſonges, till he was vtterly melted into teares, with ſuch an exceſsiue dolour, that what he held, fell out of his handes through his extreme feeblenes, without any feeling of his; waſhing his ſoule with the teares of his corporall eyes, which he made blinde, to illuminate his ſoule interiourly. And though he had attained to ſuch degree of perfection and ſanctity, he anſweared his Phiſitian, who told him he would deſtroy his eyes if he did not abſtaine frō ſuch weeping, that he would rather looſe the eyes which he had cōmon with flies, thē the teares, by meane whereof he illuminated the eyes of his ſpiritt, and

made them like vnto thoſe of Angels, in the contemplation of God. Notwithſtanding which torrent of teares, he alwayes ſheued a gracious face as one that by reaſon of the puritie of his conſcience, feared nothing, and was euer vnited with God. He alſo ioyfully receaued whatſoeuer came from his holy hand. But in regard that one could not arriue to this perfection without hauing precedentlie waſhed his ſoule from the ſpottes of ſinnes and imperfections, he ordinarily perſuaded his Religious to endeauour to purge themſelues with teares poured out for the paſsion of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  How the hole Father S. Francis ſeeing any creature afflicted could not forbeare to weepe, conſidering therin his God, in his dolourous paſsion.
                  THE CVI. CHAPTER.
                  BY this charity of compaſsion which he perfectly carryed to IESVS CHRIST, his ſoule remayned ſo affected to ſuffer all aduerſities with his neighbour as a member of IESVS CHRIST, that he was as much greiued as if himſelfe had endured, and this purity ſo augmented that he could not endure any creature to be afflicted, though they were vnreaſonable, and among them, thoſe particulerly, to whome the holy ſcripture compareth our Lord IESVS CHRIST: and therefore he loued litle Lambes, in whome is figured the patience &amp; meeknes of our God. Comming from Ancona to Oſimo with brother Paul, whome he had made Prouinciall of the Marches, he mett vpon the way a ſheepheard that among many goates and kiddes, had one only ſheepe, which beholding, he felt his heart through pearced with greife, to ſee the ſaid ſheepe alone among ſo many goates and kiddes, reprobate creatures: he therfore ſaid to his companion: Behold, brother, how meeke that ſheep is among thoſe goates: our Lord walked ſo humble and meeke among the Scribes and Pariſees, in memory whereof I pray you lett vs endeauour to redeeme it out ofS. Franc. deſired a sheep becauſe it was among goates &amp; kiddes &amp; had it. this ſheepheards handes. But his companion not knowing what remedy to apply, in regard they had no mony, he began with the holy Father to bewayle his greife; they both thus weeping, by chaunce there arriued a merchaunt, who hauing demaunded thē the cauſe of their weeping; and vnderſtanding the ſame, payed the ſheepeard for the ſaid ſheep and gaue it to the holy Father, who full of comfort, conducted it to Oſimo, euen to the preſence of the Biſhop, who admiring therat, and demaunding the cauſe after he vnderſtood it, was much amazed att the great goodnes and admirable ſimplicity of the holy Father, &amp; began

alſo to weep. Now the day following, that the ſheep might not be worſe entreated, he left it with the Religious women of Seuerina, which was much to their contentment, for the deuotion which they boare to the S. And therefore keeping it as a peculier relique, in ſhort time it yelded ſo ſo much wool as they made therof an habit, which was ſent him in their name to the chapter following: which he receaued with ſuch affection, as cannot be expreſſed: for embracing it very louingly, he called all them that were there, to reioyce with him, att the profitt he had made of that ſheep.
                  On an other time he mett in the ſame Prouince of Marches, a contry man that carryed on his ſhoulders two lambes to ſell att the Marckett, &amp; comming neere the holy Father, he laid downe his Lambes, a litle to repoſe himſelfe, the two lambes, then that were bound together began to bleat, &amp; the poore holy Father to cōpaſsionate them, wherfore tourning to the cōtry fellow he asked him why he held them bound in ſuch extreme affliction and torment, and he anſweared; becauſe they ſhould not eſcape, he being to carry them to the markett where neceſsity enforced him to ſell them, and that he could doe no leſſe, the S. replyed: and what wil they who buy them doe with them? the fellow anſweared O ſimple man, they will kill them, then cauſe them to be baked, boiled, or roſted according to their appetite, and ſo eat them. S. Francis, exceedinglyS. Franc. gaue his cloake to ſaue the life of two lambes. afflicted, ſaid to himſelfe: it ſhall not be ſo, for I will haue them my ſelfe: and withall went to the fellow, and ſaid: come hither, wilt thou giue me thy lambes for this my cloake? wherwith he was very well content. So hauing made exchaunge, the holy Father bethought himſelfe how he might doe to ſaue them; wherof hauing cōſulted with his companion, they found it moſt expedient to render them to the cō
                     try fellow, which they did vpon his promiſe that he ſhould neither ſell nor kill them.
                  Being in the monaſtery of Verecondo neere Agubio, a poore sheep brought foorth her yong one nere vnto a ſow▪ which did eat the tender lambe, which S. Francis did bitterly lament with theſe wordes: Ah▪ litle lambe, how wel doeſt thou repreſent the innocent death of my Sauiour IESVS CHRIST: then as zealous of the honour of almighty God, he laid his malediction on the ſaid ſow, which att the very inſtant did admirably fall diſeaſed, and within three dayes died: and by force of this maledictiō, became of ſo loathſome ſauour that ſhe was caſt into a ditch where neither dogge, nor foule, nor other beaſt would eat her, but ſhe dryed vp, and ſo remayned for memory long time after. This example ſhould teach vs, by the temporall puniſhment of this beaſt, that whoſoeuer vſeth crueltie towardes his neighbour, cannot auoyd the eternall iudgement of God: as alſo how iuſt the compaſsion of this

                     Pſal. 21. S. was, fith it merited to be heard of God, who being, by his Prophett Dauid, called worme, and not a man; the holy Father tooke vp the very wormes he found on the wayes, that paſſengers might not tread on thē with their feet. In the winter he gaue either wine or hunny to the flyes to preſerue their liues, and ſo by meane of all creatures, he eleuated his hart to God the Creatour, in whome he liued with full conſolation.
               
               
                  An expoſition of the glorious Father S. Francis, made on the Pater noster.
                  THE CVII. CHAPTER.
                  THe Pater noſter, was the principall of all the prayers which the holy Father moſt contentedlie vſed, wherin he coceaued a meruaylous taſt, eleuating his hart vnto God. And therefore he taught his Religious, for edification of their neighbour to ſay it in this manner: Our Father, moſt bleſſed and moſt holie, our Creatour and Conſolatour, which art in heauen, amongeſt the Angels and SS. whome with they preſence thou doeſt illuminate, thy ſelfe being the light; thou doeſt enflame them with loue, thou being loue it ſelfe, rayſing them to thy glorie: thou dwelleſt in them, becauſe thou art the ſoueraigne eternall good, whence all good is deriued, and without which nothing is good in it ſelfe; Hallowed he thy name, and lett thy knoweldge be manifeſted vnto vs: that we may the better knowe the greatnes of thy benefittes, and the accompliſhmenr of thy promiſes, the eminency of thy Mareſtie, and the depth of thy iudgementes; Thy kingdome come, to the end thou now raigne in vs, by grace, and that hereafter we, attaine the other of glorie, where is eternallie thy glorious preſence, with perfect loue, glorious companie, and ioy and alacritie without end; Thy will be done in earth as is it in heauen, that we may loue thee with an infinite loue, and may be alwayes in cogitation with thee, that we be with thee in intention, and with thee in ſpiritt, ſeeking thine honour in all our actions, with all the forces and powers of our ſoule, and bodie, freelie employing all in the ſeruice of thy loue, and in no other thing, and that, to obſerue thy commandement, we loue our neighbour as our ſelues, ſhewing to all as to our ſelues an entier charitie, for thy loue, reioycing att the good of others, as att our owne, compaſsionating their neceſsities and afflictions as our owne, giuing them all aſsiſtance we can poſsible, far from offending them, as our ſelues would deſire to be aſsiſted in like neceſsity: Giue vs this day our daily bread: that is, thy deerly beloued and bleſſed Sonne, our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, in our

ſpiritt and vnderſtanding, with all reuerence, by the great loue wherwith he hath affected, and by what ſoeuer he hath ſaid, done, and endured, for vs wretches; And forgiue vs our debtes, by thine infinite mercy, by the vertue of the paſsion of thine only Sonne our lord IESVS CHRIST, and by the merittes and prayers of the bleſſed virgin Mary, pardon vs alſo good God, As we forgiue our debters: and if we pardon not them perfectly as we ought, make vs, Lord, to doe it, that we may meritt pardon. Graunt, good God, that by thy loue, we doe not only forbeare to doe euill for euill, nor hate our ennemies, but that we loue them, and that by good offices and prayers for them we demonſtrate the ſame to thee, O God of mercie. Lord God forſake vs not in our cruell temptations, both ſecrett and manifeſt, and permit vs not to fall therin, but deliuer vs from euill, paſt, by meane of true contrition, and holy pennance; preſent, by preſeruation of thy grace, and future, by perſeuerance in thy moſt holy feare. Amen.
                  
               
               
                  Of certaine other myſticall prayers and canticles, which the holy Frther S. Francis made.
                  THE CXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  The Holy Father in his canonicall houres ſaid in latin theſe prayers following, which he compoſed in the prayſe of God.
                  
                     Apoc. 3. HOly, holy, holy, lord God almightie, which art, which haſt bin, and art to come, thou art worthy that we offer vnto thee, and to receaue of vs, all prayſe and honour, and that we exalt and acknowledge thee aboue althinges, the lambe that was slaine is worthy to receaue all vertue, diuinitie, wiſdome, force, glorie, honour and benediction. Lett vs alwayes prayſe God, lett vs yeld the honour dew vnto the Father, the Sonne, and the the holie Ghoſt: lett vs praiſe God for euer: lett vs prayſe the lord of heauen, and earth, and of all other thinges created vnder and on the earth, with thoſe that are in heauen: lett vs prayſe God and exalt him for euer. Glorie be to the Father, and to the Sonne, and to the holie Ghoſt. Lett vs prayſe God for euer and magnifie him as he hath bin, is now, and ſhallbe world without end. Amen. Lett vs prayſe God and exalt him for euer, Amen.
                  
                  
                     An other breife prayer vnto God.
                     Almighty moſt high and my ſoueraigne good, all good that onlie is good. We giue thee all praiſe, all praiſe, all glorie, all honour, and yeld thee all the thanckes we can, and will that all good be referred to thee alone, Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     An other short prayer, for the diuine office
                     Moſt high moſt mighty, moſt iuſt, and moſt mercifull lord, afford vs miſerable wretches ſo much of thy grace, that we may accompliſh thy holy will, and may with all diligence ſeeke that alone which pleaſeth thee: that being interiourly illuminated and enflamed with the fire of the holy Ghoſt, we may tread the moſt holy ſteppes of thine only Sonne our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, that by meane of this thy grace we may ſee thee with the bleſſed, thou that art the moſt high God, who liueſt in perfect Trinity, ſimplicity, and vnity, and as almighty raigneſt in eternall glory. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     A prayer to the Queene of heauen and to the Angels.
                     God ſaue thee, holy Queene, moſt holy Mary, mother of God, and perpetuall virgin, choſen of God the Father, and of the holy Ghoſt the comforter; in whome is faith and the entier perfection of all eminent vertue with all good vnited, ſith thou haſt merited to haue in thee the author of life and grace. God ſaue thee diuine Pallace: God ſaue thee the habitation and tabernacle of the Redeemer: God ſaue thee, thee robe of God: God ſaue thee, the ſeruant and mother of God: and God ſaue thee, with all the Angelicall powers, conſidering that thou art ſent by the holy Ghoſt into the hartes of rebelles, that of Infidelles thou make faithfull and true ſeruantes of God. O moſt worthy mother of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, Eſpouſe of the holy Ghoſt, pray for vs with S. Michael the Archangell, and all the celeſtiall ſpirittes, vnto they beloued Sonne our lord and maſter. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     An other prayer to the virgin.
                     Holy Mary virgin and lady, like vnto whome neuer woman was borne, nor ſhalbe, in the world, daughter and ſeruant of the moſt high king and celeſtiall Father, moſt ſacred mother of IESVS CHRIST, and Eſpouſe of the holy Ghoſt, pray for vs, with all the Angels and ſainctes, vnto they beloued Sonne, that he will voutſafe to ſaue vs: Glory be to the Father, vnto the Sonne, and to the bleſſed holy Ghoſt, Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     Praiſes vnto God.
                     Lord God, thou art holy and God of all Goddes, that worckeſt merueillous thinges, that art the mighty and moſt high, thou art the omnipotent Father, and entierly ſoueraigne lord of heauen and earth, God in Trinity and Vnity and ſempiternall, ſoueraigne good, all good, and euery good thing. Lord God liuing and true, thou art true loue and perfect charity, thou art wiſdome, humility and patience, thou art the incomprehenſible beauty, thou art true pleaſure and aſſured repoſe, thou art our hope and ioy, thou art iuſtice, temperance, fortitude and prudence of mortall men: thou art the richeſſe that can ſatiate vs: thou art

meeke, thou art our only protectour and our guard, thou art our vertue, faith hope and charity, and the ſweetnes and conſolation of all; thou art the bounty without end, a great God and admirable, God omnipotent, pittifull, merciful and our Sauiour. Glory be to the Father and to theS. Franc. deuout to the verſicle Gloria Pat. Sonne &amp;c. The holy Father ſainct Francis had a very feruent deuotiō to this verſicle Gloria Patri, therfore he often repeated it in his prayers. He reſpected not ſo much, Sicut erat. Saying euenſong one day with Brother Leo, att euery verſe of Magnificat, he ſaid, Gloria Patri, feeling therin a merueillous taſt and contentment, yea ſuch as he thought he ſhould neuer be ſatisfied with ſaying thereof: he taught a Religious Preiſt, that was in affliction and extremely tempted, to ſay, Gloria Patri, which he did, and was incontinently deliuered of his temptation.
                  
               
               
                  Of the Canticle of the ſunne and other creatures, compoſed by S. Francis.
                  THE CIX. CHAPTER.
                  THis holy Father compoſed a Canticle in latin, in the prayſe of God, when he reuealed vnto him the fruition of the glory of Paradice, and becauſe the ſunne, of all corporall, creatures is the cheife of the irreaſonable, and our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST is called the Sunne of iuſtice, he therfore intituled it the Canticle of the ſunne, which is that which followeth, diuided into eight litle verſes, conformable to the eight beatitudes. Moſt high lord, all prayſes, glory, and honours are thine, to thee alone ought to be rendred and referred al graces; and no man is worthy to name thee. My God be thou prayſed and exalted of all creatures, and particulerly of our brother the Sunne thy worcke, which illuminateth the day that lighteneth vs, it is alſo thy figure, by his beauty and ſplendour; likewiſe of the ſiluer moone and glittering ſtarres which thou haſt created in heauen ſo bright and ſo beautifull. My God be prayſed by the fire, whereby the night is lightened in his darcknes, becauſe it is reſplendent, pleaſant, ſubtil, cleare, beautifull and vigorous. Lett the aire and windes, cleare and cloudy ſeaſons and all other ſeaſons, prayſe my God, wherby all other baſe creatures doe liue. Lett my God be prayſed by the water, an element moſt neceſſary and profitable to mortall creatures, humble, chaſt, and cleare. Lett my God be prayſed by the earth our mother, which ſupporteth and nouriſheth vs, producing ſuch diuerſity of herbes, flowers, and fruites.
                  
                     
                     S. Francis added the enſuing verſicle, when he accorded the Bishop and the Capitaine of Aſsiſium, as in place proper shalbe inſerted.
                     Let my God be prayſed by them that pardon each for his loue, and ſupport in pacience, afflictions and infirmities, with alacritie of ſpiritt. Bleſſed are they that liue in peace, for they ſhall be crowned in heauen.
                  
                  
                     The holy Father likewiſe added the verſe enſuyng, when God▪ had reuealed vnto him the day of his death.
                     Let my God be prayſed by corporall death, which no liuing man can eſcape. Wretched be they that dy in mortall ſinne, and bleſſed thoſe that att the houre of their death be found in thy grace, as hauing obeyd thy moſt ſacred will: for they ſhall not ſee the ſecond death of eternall torments. Lett all creatures prayſe and giue thanckes to my God, lett them be gratefull vnto him, and ſerue him with due humility. This Canticle was many times ſung by the ſaid S. vnto his Brethren, whome he alſo taught to ſing the ſame. He exceedingly reioyced when he ſaw them ſing it with grace and feruour: for hearing it he merueillouslie eleuated his ſpirit vnto God. He ſent certaineBr. Pacificus a Muſiciā. of his Religious that were very ſpirituall, vnto Brother Pacificus, who liuing in the world had bin a very skilfull Muſitian, as we haue ſaid, that he might learne them to ſing it perfectly in Muſicke, therby to praiſe God afterward, when they ſhould preach ouer the world: for he would they ſhould obſerue to ſing this canticle after their preaching, as a prayſe vnto God, and that they ſhould affirme themſelues to the people, to be the muſitians of God, and that they would no other reward for this their muſicke, but that they ſhould doe pennance for their ſinnes. For confirmation whereof, what are the ſeruantes of God, ſaid he, but his repreſenters to moue and awaken humane hartes to true ſpirituall ioy? and particulerlie the Freer Minors, who are giuen to the people for their ſaluation. The holy Father affirmed, that in the morning att Sunne riſing, a man ought to prayſe God the Creatour of the Sunne, by whoſe beames our eyes are illuminated by day: and that he ought likewiſe to prayſe God in the night for his Brother the Fire, becauſe by it our eyes are lightened by night: and that we ſhould be all blinde, if God did not illuminate our eyes by theſe two creatures: for which and for the other creatures whoſe vſe we ordinarily haue, we ought continually to prayſe our glorious Creatour.

We alſo thancke thee for that, as thou haſt created vs for thy Sonne, ſo for the infinite loue which thou diddeſt beare vnto vs thou haſt procured him to be borne in this world, true God and true man, of the wombe of the euer glorious virgin Mary, and wouldeſt that his life ſhould be vnto vs an example of pouerty, humility, and penitence: and that his precious bloud▪ his tormentes, and moſt cruell death, ſhould be the price of the Redemption of humaine nature. Finally we thanck thee for that thy Sonne is once againe to come downe on earth, in glory and maieſty, to chaſe the accurſed into hell, who would not repent nor acknowledge thee for Redeemer; and to ſay to them that ſhall haue ſerued and adored him, and done pennance: Come ye bleſſed of my Father, poſſeſſe the kingdome, which is prepared for you from the beginning of the world. But becauſe we miſerable ſinners are not worthy ſo much as to name thee, we humblie beſeech thee to accept, that our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST thine only beloued Sonne, with the holy Ghoſt the true comforter, doe yeld vnto thee for each of vs the thanckes we owe thee, according to thy pleaſure, and that he ſatisfy thee for all the graces thou giueſt vs by his meane and ſhalt giue vs, prouided that we faile not in our endeauour, ſuch and ſo great as no humane tongue ſhalbe able to expreſſe.

                  Of the intelligence, and ſpiritt of prophetie which this S. had.
                  THE CXI. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Francis had in ſuch ſort cleared his ſoule, illuminated and vnited it to our ſoueraine God, by the continuall exerciſe of prayer, that albeit he had no ouer-great vnderſtanding of holy ſcripture, being neuertheleſſe illuminated by the beames of diuine reuelation, he did penetrate the ſublimity of the ſaid ſcripture, with an admirable intelligence of the diuine myſteries, by which, acquired ſcience remayneth excluded, the infuſed of diuine loue entring in his place. And therfore, what he read in holy ſcripture, he vnderſtood by diuine reuelation, as a dilligent diſciple of the holyS. Franc. had a ſcience infuſed frō heauen that made him admirable to the moſt learned diuines. Ghoſt: he firſt imprinted it in his memory, and then ruminated the ſame with an interiour taſt of deuotion: And (if God inſpired him not) he neuer reuealed it to any perſon to appeare a learned maſter, as now the practiſe is.
                  The Cardinall of Hoſtia, Protectour of the Order, who was afterward Pope Gregory the ninth, ſecretlie requeſted him one time, for the conſolation of his ſoule to expound vnto him certaine profound places of holy ſcripture: I doe not, ſaid he, demaund this theologicall expoſition of you, as of a great doctour, for I know well you haue not ſtudied: But I require it, as of a man illuminated of the holy Ghoſt. The S. ſatisfied him, and gaue him ſuch contentment as he could deſire no more.
                  Being one day att Sienna, a Religious diuine asked him, how the Prophett Ezechiel is to be vnderſtood where he ſaith: If thou doe not admonish
                     Ezec. 33. 
                     the impious of his impiety, an account of his eternall death shalbe exacted of thee: the holy Father anſweared: if thoſe wordes be to be vnderſtood generally as they ſound, I thus vnderſtand them, that the ſeruant of God ought in ſuch ſort to burne and giue light by exemplare life, and by his pious conuerſation, that he ſeeme ſilently to reprehend all the impious: for by ſuch in deed, he preacheth their vices. Wherein is duely to be conſidered, how much more a Religious is obliged herevnto by the light of his good life, ſeeing that it is here apparent that if he doe it not, he cannot eſcape the terrible iudgement of the liuing God: which prudent and true interpretation, the diuine affirmed to proceed directlie from heauen, and that himſelfe could not giue a more direct expoſition then was giuen by him, with the ſwift &amp; ſpeedy winges of the eagle ſoaring from infuſed ſcience. And affirmed with all that our interpretation was not ſuch, which proceeding

from our blinded vnderſtanding, goeth naturally, as a ſerpent trayling his body on the earth. The ſaid Religious did not try the holie Father in this matter onlie, but in diuers others alſo, in all which, he reſted fully ſatisfied, and exceedinglie admiring att the grace which God had giuen him, which was ſo great, that he could not only diſcouer and vnderſtand myſteries paſt, but (which God alone of himſelfe can doe) he diſcouered euē the thinges to come, as if he had had them then before his very eyes, as by this example and them that follow, ſhall euidentlie appeare.
                  The holie Father being yet in the cittie of Sienna, he once demaunded a charitie for the loue of God of an affectionate freind of his, who directlie anſweared him he would not graunt it, but that he ſhould firſt tell him the certainty of his predeſtinatiō: a demaund doubtles verie ſtraūge,Propheſies of S. Francis. yea exceeding terrible. But God that would, for his profitt, manifeſt vnto the world the merits of this his ſo glorious ſeruāt, was cōtent he ſhold promiſe to aſſure him: Being thē amazed att this ſo inciuill requeſt, he eleuated and addreſſed his countenance to heauē, but much more his ſpiritt, and ſo remayned in prayer a certaine ſpace, wherin was reuealed vnto him that this man was of the nōber of the predeſtinate, and then heOf the ſaluation of his freind. promiſed his deuout freind eternall life, aſſuring him of his ſaluatiō. But this good man vnable to conceale this his ſo extreme ſpirituall alacrity, and ſo cōming to the eares of the afore ſaid Religious diuine, he was exceedinglie ſcādalized att the preſūption of the holie Father. Therefore repayring vnto him, filled with choller as an other Phariſie, he demaunded if it were true, the S. anſwearing affirmatiuelie; he laughing and deriding him, ſaid: and who hath reuealed vnto youthat this your freind ſhould be ſaued? to whome the S. verie iealous of the honour of God, openly anſweared: he that alſo told me that the laſt night thou committedſt ſuch a ſecrett ſinne, and that therfore, in ſhort time thou ſhalt abandō
                     The apoſtaſie of a Religious thy habitt. But becauſe the Religious deſerued not pardon, though by manifeſtation of his ſinne he might be well aſſured of the enſuying puniſhment which he propheſied vnto him, he neuertheles did not penance as the holie Father then admoniſhed him, God permitting him to die out of his Order, that by his damnation, he might manifeſteſt the ſaluation of the other.
                  Whiles he was in the cāp of the Chriſtians vnder Damiette, when he wēt to preach to the great Soldā, he propheſied to the Chriſtians that ifOf the loſse of a battell. they gaue battell they would looſe the feild. But they not beleeuing him, their fault of incredulity was payed by the loſſe of the bodie of the army that was putt to flight, where of one part was slaine. Retourning afterward on this ſide the ſea, and arriuing att Celano, he was inuited to dinner by a gentleman, where being, as according to his couſtume he prayed before his ſitting to the table, he ſaw in his God, on whome he had alwayes

his eyes eleuated, that which he fore told, as it afterward arriued, for incontinentlie calling vnto him the ſaid gentleman. ConfeſſeOf the ſodaine death of his freind and prepare your ſelfe, ſaid he, for in ſhort time you ſhall dye, and from this time you ſhall receaue the recompence of all the good worckes you haue done, particulerlie in harbouring the ſeruantes of God. Doe then in ſuch ſort as without impediment you may goe directlie to God. The gentleman therefore who had confidence in the wordes of the holie Father, ſodenlie taking leaue of him prepared himſelfe to confeſsion, then calling the companion of ſainct Francis who was preiſt, he made an entiere confeſsion vnto him: afterwardes he recomended his patrimonie to the diuine prouidence, ſo to auoyd all impediment. And ſo with the greateſt deuotion he could poſsible he expected when God would call and inuite him: but he expected not long, for whiles his familie were att table, without other greife, but very well diſpoſed of body and ſpiritt, he rendred his ſoule to his Creatour, according to the propheſie of the holy Father, armed by the diuine mercie, with armour conuenient and neceſſarie to a true penitent.
               
               
                  How S. Francis ſaw the ſecrets of mennes conſciences.
                  THE CXII. CHAPTER.
                  OVr lord IESVS CHRIST hauing choſen the glorious Father S. Francis for Paſtour of his flock, he alſo ſo illuminated him interiourlie by his diuine vertue, that he diſcouered vnto him the ſecrettes of the conſciences of thoſe that were his, and likewiſe their priuate and hidden neceſsities: ſo that by the ſame meane he knew both the grace which they had receaued of God, and euē that which they thē receaued. By this knowledge he foretold the fall of manie, who ſeemed to haue attayned the ſtate of perfection, and on the contrarie the ſaluatiō of manie wicked, propheſying their conuerſion. He ſaw what ſhould ſucceed them for manie yeares after, as if it had bin preſent, onlie beholding the vnſpotted and cleare mirour of diuine light, and his admirable ſplendour, by a diuine prerogatiue and eſpecially the ſucceſſes and mutatiōs of Religion, which he would ſometimes with abōdance of teares cōmunicate to his cōpanions. Touching that which concerned the conſciencesS. Franc. knew the thoughts of men. of his Religious, he both with al poſsible ſpeed and effect redreſſed the ſame: and if they were far diſtant, he appeared vnto them in their sleepe, and inſtructed them what they ought to doe, and frō what to abſtaine, as by the ſequell ſhall appeare.
                  The holie Father comming from beyond the ſea, with his companion Brother Leonard, a Religious of very worthie familie, and being by reaſon of his infirmities verie wearie and feeble, he had for ceraine

dayes the vſe of an aſſe. But the poore Brother Leonard that followed him a foote, being alſo very weary, began to murmure, ſaying to himſelfe:Of a Religious that murmured becauſe goeing a foot S. Francis had an aſse. what doe I poore follow that I am, to follow this man a foot? Is there not great difference betweene his diſcent and mine? why then contrary to that which ſhould be, doe I goe on foot and he on horſeback? and euen I follow him as a lackye driuing this aſſe, with ſpeed, and ſo wearying my ſelfe as I can no longer endure. The good Brother Leonard went on thus ſtill diſcourſing with himſelfe in his firſt motions, when as the holy Father S. Francis ſeeing in ſpiritt the ſecret murmure of his companion called him, and alighting from his aſſe, he ſaid: Brother and Freind, I confeſſe I haue litle diſcretion, to ſee you ſo wearily to goe a foot, and my ſelfe to ride att mine eaſe: Gett vp therfore on this aſſe, now att leaſt whiles I remember me, conſidering that being in the world, you were farre more noble and more honnorable then my ſelfe. Brother Leonard hearing this was vtterly confounded and amazed, that the S. ſo ſoone knew his euill cogitation: Falling therfore at his feet, and confeſsing his vaine ridiculous diſcourſe, with a very deep contrition, he asked and obtayned pardon.
                  Two very ſpirituall Religious came expresly from Rieta to the Oratory of Grecio, to viſitt S Francis and to haue his benediction. But being there ariued, it was told them that there was no hope of ſpeaking with the holy Father, by reaſon that hauing taken his refection he was retourned to his cell, where he prayed and slept, and came forth but once a day to eat, it being lent and that being then ſo ſolitary, he would not haue his companiō, much leſſe any other Religious to diſturbe him, vnles he ſo commaunded. Theſe two poore Religious exceedingly afflicted, eſteeming themſelues by reaſon of their ſinnes vnworthy of ſuch grace, not hauing oportunity any longer to expect, becauſe their ſuperiour had commaunded them to retourne the ſame night to their Couent, they haſtened homeward. S. Francis who in ſpiritt had ſeen allOf two Religious that came to viſit him. this, contrary to his cuſtome came haſtely out of his c

                     lle, and went after the ſaid Religious, who by that time were farre gone, and ſo in an inſtant giuing them conſolation together with his benediction which they demaunded, he diſmiſſed them doubly ſatisfied, knowing that the holy Father came by diuine inſpiration to giue them his benediction.
                  
                     Of a Religious that by humility would conceale the fault which his companiō had committed. Two Religious comming from Naples to viſitt him, the elder of them on the way committed ſome fault, att which the yonger was extremely ſcandalized: now comming to the preſence of S. Francis, he giuing them his benediction, demaunded of the yonger, how his companion had behaued himſelfe: he eſteeming it indecent to diſcouer the faultes of his Brother, anſweared, well. The holy Father replyed, My

ſonne, beware that vnder colour of humility, you doe not lye; for I know what hath paſſed in your iorney: and I would haue you know that you ſhall ſhortly ſee this man to proue worſe: Which ſo ſucceeded, for this old man not long after went out of the Order, according to that which S. Francis had foretold for the ſinne, for the ſcandall, and for his neglect of doeing pennance, which is the ladder to diuine mercie.
                  In the firſt beginning when none was admitted and receaued into the Order, but by S. Francis himſelfe, a gentleman of Luca, came expreſſy to demaund the habitt of him, he had with him ſome of his cō
                     panions, it being when he lay ſicke in the Biſhoppes lodgeing of Aſsiſium. The ſaid gentleman being conducted to the S. he fell on his knees before him, moſt inſtantlie beſeeching him to admitt him into his Religion, but the holy Father beholding him attentiuely, anſweared: O miſerable man, this requeſt is not graunted to men entierly addicted to ſenſuality and to the world, as you are, for you doe lye to the holy Ghoſt: theſe teares are ſeigned and not true; your interiour is not with God: neither is it he that calleth you to this Religion. Depart you therfore in good time, for you are not fitt for it. The holy Father had ſcarceOf a gentleman that feined to deſire the habitt of F. Minor. ended theſe wordes, but the Religious vnderſtood that the kinred of this gentleman were come for him: but not beleeuing them, he put his head out att the windoe, whence hauing ſeene them, he was very ioyfull, and taking leaue of the ſaid Religious he retourned with them to his houſe. Thoſe preſent exceedingly admired the ſpiritt of S. Francis, that knew the feined intentions of this man who exteriourlie appeared ſo contrite.

                  THE CXIII. CHAPTER.
                  HE knew by an other Religious, who being deluded by the deuil he more ſtrictly to keepe ſilence proceeded ſo farre, as that he would not ſo much as confeſſe as did the other Religious but by ſignes as one dumme: which he vſed alſo when he demaunded any

thing, and without any ſpeech he ſheued ſuch ſignes of ſpirituall alacritie, that he moued all the Religious to prayſe God: The fame hereof was preſentlie diuulged, ſo that he was generally held for a S. In the meane while S. Francis arriuing where this Religious was, he was aduertiſed of his proceeding; but he anſweared that he was exceedingly tempted and deluded by the deuill, becauſe confeſsion of the mouth was neceſſary, as contrition of the ſoule, and ſatisfaction of worckes. The ſuperiour of the place then confirmed the ſainctity of the ſaid Religious, vnto S. Francis, alleadgeing that it was not poſsible he ſhould be tempted of the deuill, conſidering the ſignes of ſanctity which he exteriourlie ſhewed. The holy Father replyed, proue him in this manner: commaund him to confeſſe twice or att leaſt once euery weeke, which if he refuſe, beleeue that it is a deluſion of the deuill. Which the ſuperiour hauing done, the Religious putting his finger in his mouth, and ſhaking his head, by theſe ſignes declared, that he could not doe it, for breaking of ſilence. His ſuperiour would no farther vrge him: but the great prudence of S. Francis was not long vnknowne: for a litle after this Religious S. abandoned his Religion, a tooke a ſeculer habitt. Two Religious of his companions meeting him attyred ſeculerly, conceauing great compaſsion of his blindenes, ſayd vnto him: O miſerable wretch and forgetfull of thy ſelfe, where is that thy ſolitarie and ſainct-like life, yea ſuch, as thou wouldeſt not conuerſe with thy Brethren, nor ſpeake in Confeſsion, for keeping of ſilence? thow now hauing loſt thy ſelfe in the world, abandoned our habitt, reiected thy vow, and broaken the rule, as if thou haddeſt no beleefe of God? but he gaue them ſo diuelliſh an anſweare, that he plainly diſcouered, he had not only chaunged habitt but alſoOne muſt beware of ſingularity. Religion, and interiour vertue. Theſe good Religious could by no meanes reduce him, though they laboured to reprint in his minde the obligation he had to God, and the perill of his damnation: and ſo in few dayes after he dyed, being in poſſeſsion of the deuill that held him choaked: becauſe he would not confeſſe. It is a worthy example for all Religious, to beware of ſingularity, in matters appertayning to their Order, that demonſtrate more pride then ſpiritt of deuotion and humility.
               
               
                  
                  Of other merueillous accidents wherin the ſpiritt of Prophetie of S. Francis did miracously appeare.
                  THE CXIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe Cardinall of Hoſtia hauing on a time commaund S. Francis to repaire vnto him to Rieta, where then was Pope Honorious with his Court: and comming neere the citty he ſaw a great troup of people that came againſt him: wherfore ſtopping his iorney, he ſtaid in a Church, before S. Fabian, a league and halfe from the citty, where was a very poore Preiſt, that very curteously and in the beſt manner he could, entertayned him: But the Cardinals and many other of his Court, knowing whither he was retired, went thither to ſee him: by this viſitation; the vineyard of the poore Preiſt was waſtfullie gathered by the indiſcretion of the trampling traine of the Cardinals and others, whereat he exceedingly complayned, repenting that he had entertayned S. Francis, in regard that for the litle good he had done him, he thought he ſhould incurre ſuch loſſe. The holy Father,S. Franc. obtayned of God that a litle vigne boare ten times double of that he vſed, and why. who in ſpiritt knew the affliction of the Preiſt, that durſt not acquaint him therewithall, and who on the other ſide knew what fruit he was to procure in that place, whither he had bin expresly ſent of God, there to plant an abondant vigne of true penitentes: in which reſpect he could not depart thence, reputing it behoufull to endure the loſſe of that litle materiall vigne; for the better gayning a ſpirituall. Neuertheles as a pittifull louing Father, he called the Preiſt, whome, for his conſolation, he bad not to vex himſelfe nor to feare, for of the litle that remayned of his vigne he ſhould gather double the ordinary, though there appeared almoſt nothing. The Preiſt that firmely beleeued theſe wordes, deſerued alſo to be recompenced according to his faith: for wheras he accuſtomed to haue three hogſheddes, he had then twenty, of verie good wine, as the holy Father had promiſed him: which (with exceeding ioy and admiration) he related vnto him and to all the people thereabout, to the prayſe of God, and of his ſeruant Francis.
                  This holy Father being in the Prouince of Maſſa, on the Mount Caſal, within a deſert Church there employed in prayer, God reuealed vnto him that in the ſame Church were relikes of his ſainctes. Wherefore determining that they ſhould no longer there remaine concealed, and without the honour due vnto them, and hauing no opportunity of

longer abode in the ſaid church, by reaſon of other occurrances forReuelatiōs made to S. Fr. which he was to take order; he commaunded his Religious, ſheuing them where they were, to take them from that place, and to carry them into their church: which hauing ſaid, he departed. But theſe good Religious forgatt it: Wherefore they being one day to ſay maſſe in the Oratory, thinking to prepare the Alcare, they found vnder it certaine bright and glittering bones, that filled the place with a moſt delicious ſauour. Being extremely amazed, and diuiſing who ſhould putt them there, they remembred the commaundement which S. Francis had giuen them, and concluded that thoſe were the reliques which he commaunded them to remoue: and that becauſe they had fayled therein, God had miraculouslie ſupplyed it: as accordinglie S. Francis, being retourned to that place, and hauing vnderſtood the proceſſe and pardoned the Religious their negligence who moſt humblie required the ſame, thancked God very hartilie for that he voutſafed to haue care of the very duſt of his true ſeruantes, then he went to ſee andPredictiō of S. Fr. concerning two Religious giuing them the habitt. with great contentment to reuerence them. Brother Pellegrino and Brother Falcone, comming to take the habitt att the hands of S. Francis, he propheſied vnto them, that the firſt, though verie learned, ſhould ſerue the Religious as a lay Brother: and the other, albeit ignorant, ſhould applie himſelfe to contemplation, wherein he ſhould proue moſt perfect, as the other reciprocally in humility: which came to paſſe, as in the ſixt booke, and 55. chapter, ſhall appeare.

                        ſies of S. Francis. afflicted with the greife of his eyes, a Preiſt called Gedeon aduaunced by the ſaid biſhop, a man worldlie affected, had long time kept his bed ſicke, without power to remoue him ſelfe, and when any endeauoured to take hold of him or lift him vp, he remayned vtterlie crooked, for he could in no manner ſtand vpright. So perceauing that no humane application auayled, and that Sainct Francis rightlie to the purpoſe was there, he cauſed himſelfe to be brought before him: at whoſe feet falling, he beſought him to make the ſigne of the croſſe vpon him: The holie Father anſweared: My Brother and friend, know that becauſe to this day thou haſt liued carnallie, and according to the allurementes of thy ſenſuall appetites, without any reſpect of the iudgementes

of God, he hath therefore ſent this affliction to make thee know and amend thy ſelfe. But now in his holy name I giue thee hisTo a Preiſt curing him by the ſigne of the croſse. benediction: and doe aduertiſe thee, that if thou alter not thy courſe of life, a greater miſerie will befall thee, for the ſinne of ingratitude. So hauing made on him the ſigne of the croſſe, the Preiſt incontinentlie aroſe very ſound, and ſtretching himſelfe on his feet, the chinebone, and the breſt plate gaue a cracke as a ſtaffe forciblie broaken. But by reaſon that this ingratfull fellow and ennemy of his ſaluation, retourned vnto his vomitt, being one day with diuers of his companions, committing their ordinarie ſinnes, about midnight the looſe of the houſe fell vpon him, and ſo being cruſhed and slaine alone, that the diuine vengeance might the more euidentlie appeare, according to the propheſie of S. Francis, he miſerablie ended his life.
                  Being att his Oratory in Grecio, it was told him, that the violent ſtormes did euery yeare deſtroy all the fruites of that place, that the wolues deuoured the cartell, and that the very inhabitantes could hardly be ſecure of their liues. The holy Father therefore hauingTo a country man. compaſsion of theſe poore people, he made them a ſermon, wherby he exhorted them all to amendement of life, as the ſureſt meane to appeaſe the wrath of God: to confeſſe and communicate, with a firme purpoſe to offend no more: affirming that by this meane God would disburden them of the ſaid puniſhment: which being effected, he admoniſhed them to beware of ſinning a freſh, for then the chaſticement would be redoubled. This people moued by theſe holy demonſtrations, prepared themſelues with great contrition, confeſſed, communicated, did penance for their ſinnes and craued mercy of God: in reſpect wherof and in fauour of the prayers of the holy Father, God incontinentlie freed and deliuered them from the tempeſt and wolues, yea in ſhort time this people did not only repaire their dommages paſt: but became very rich. But alas! they could not long time perfeuer in this happy eſtate, which made them forget the behoufull admonitions of S. Francis: which procuring Godes wrath, he ſo chaſticed them with the rodde of peſtilence, that few among them remayned aliue: he alſo burned a great number of their houſes, accompliſhing all that S. Francis had foretold vnto them.
                  As this holy Father preached in Apulia, a Religious that was fallen from his Order, repayred vnto him, fell att his feet, and with infinite teares demaunded him pardon: promiſing if heTo a Religious fallen frō his order. would reſtore him the habitt, to correct his courſe of life. The Sainct made him ariſe, and before he ſpake a word, ſhewed him a gibbett that was vpon the high way, then ſaid vnto him: I

receaue thee, but remember that if thou once againe proue an Apoſtata from the Order, thou ſhalt be hanged on that gibbett. Which euen ſo ſucceeded: for falling againe, and being ſhortly after in cōpany with certaine lewd fellowes, he was apprehended and hanged on the ſame gibbett, cōfirming the vſuall prouerbe: a wicked life hath a wicked death.
               
               
                  Of the peace which was made betweene the Bishop and the Gouernour of Aſsiſium, by meane of two Religious ſent by S. Francis to ſing in their preſence the canticle of the ſunne.
                  THE CXVI. CHAPTER.
                  THe mortall enmities which were betweene the Biſhop and the Gouernour of Aſsiſium redoubled the greifes of S. Francis his infirmitie who lay ſicke att our lady of Angels. The Biſhop had excommunicated the Gouernour, and he had forbidden all perſons to ſell any thing to the biſhop, or to buy ought of him. So their enmities was euerie day nouriſhed and encreaſed by ſome new and diabolicall inuention, to the great ſcandall of all the cittie and the ruine of their owne ſoules. S. Francis ſeeing that neither eccleſiaſticall nor ſeculer perſō laboured to accord them, ſaid one day to his Religious: doubtles this may be a great ſhame to vs that make profeſsion to be ſuch ſeruantes of God, to permitt this ſo dangerous and abhominable hatred thus to breed, without applying any redreſſe. Wherevpon calling two of them, he ſaid: Goe preſentlie to the Gouernour, and in my name bid him to repaire to the Biſhoppes houſe together with the principall of the cittie, and as manie as he can traine thither; and two others he commanded, to goe in the meane while vnto the Biſhop, and when the Gouernour and people were come to the Biſhoppe, to ſing the Canticle of the Sunne; with the verſe which he then added, (as is before mētioned) in the prayſe of God, att which ſong (ſaid he) I hope thoſe hartes ſo obdurate againſt each other, wilbe mollified, and they will accord together a perpetuall peace: which ſo arriued. For firſt the Gouernour, as if God had commanded him to repaire to the Biſhop, obediently haſtened thither, with as manie people as he could aſſemble, and found the Biſhop in a great hall with his Clergie: where being together, one of the Religious which S. Francis ſent to the Biſhop, ſpake to them in this mā
                     ner: Syrs, and deerlie beloued Brethren in IESVS CHRIST, the holie Frather Brother Francis being by reaſon of his infirmitie, vnable to come in perſon, hath ſent vs hither, to ſing you a canticle, which he hath made in the prayſe of God. He beſeecheth you by the loue which you beare vnto his Maiſtie, and to him, that you will deuoutly heare it,

then the two Religious began with a loud voice to ſing, the Gouernour with his handes ioyned and his eyes lifted towardes heauen gaue eare vnto it, weeping for the great deuotion he had to the holy Father. The Canticle being ended, the Gouernour loudly ſpake: I verily proteſt, that I doe not only deſire to be reconciled and become freind to my lord the Biſhop, whome I ought to acknowledge for my Superiour, but euen if any one had slaine my brother or ſonne I would hartely pardon him: vttering theſe wordes he went to the Biſhop, and ſaid: My lord behold me ready, for the loue of God and his ſeruant the holy Father S. Francis, to doe what ſoeuer you ſhall enioyne me. The Biſhop alſo being exceedingly qualified, anſweared: My duety was, and being a Prelate, I hold my ſelfe obliged to haue bin the firſt in action of humility and patience: wherin hauing failed, I repent me, and aske you pardon. And with thoſe wordes full of loue and charity they embraced and kiſſed each other in token of amity, not without the infinite admiration and ioy of the aſſembly: ſith no man had induced them, for which they alſo gaue thanckes vnto God.
               
               
                  How much the ſpiritt of propheſie aſsisted the holy Father S. Francis.
                  THE CXVII. CHAPTER.
                  
                     Propheſies of S. Fr. to a yong man that he should be one of his THere came one day three yong Florentines to aske the benediction of the holy Father S. Francis: wherof the porter hauing aduertiſed him, without vttering one word he went into the garden, where he gathered fiue figges, wherof he gaue two, vnto two of the three yong men that came to viſitt him, and the other three vnto the third, to whome he ſaid: within few dayes you ſhalbe one of mine, thē hauing giuen them his benediction he diſmiſſed them. And ſhort
                        •
                     ly after, this yong man became a Frere Minour, and proued very pious and exemplar. When S. Francis gaue his benediction, it was in theſe termes: TheIn what words S. Francis gaue his benediction. name of our lord IESVS CHRIST be bleſſed and his ſacred paſsiō, the moſt holy virgin that brought him foorth with all the celeſtiall Court. Therfore being one day in prayer, the virgin Mary appeared vnto him, and gaue him the faireſt aple that could be imagined, ſaying vnto him, that as that gift was precious, euen ſo as often as her Sonne heard theſe wordes with deuotion vttered: The name of our lord be bleſſed, it was exceeding gratefull vnto him, and he ſo much eſteemed them as if ſome matter of high worth were preſented vnto him: and therfore the holy Father did afterwardes more often vſe them.
                  S. Francis reſiding att Grecio, where he tooke phiſicke for his eyes, the Phiſition being one day come to viſitt him, he inuited him to dine

in the Couent, who dwelling not far thence, neuer accuſtomed to eat there: neuertheles he was att this time content to ſtay in regard that S.S. Frane. purpoſely inuited to dinner a Phiſicion againſt all apparence. Francis had ſo inuited him: But the Guardian being by commandemēt of S. Francis and in his name aduertiſed therof, he retourned anſweare that there was nothing wherwith to entertayne him. S. Francis ſent him reply that he ſhould cauſe to be prepared the hearbes and bread which he acknowledged to haue, and ſhould leaue to God the care of the reſt. Now as they were ſitting downe att table, there knocked one att the gate, where the porter found a woman that brought a great basket on her head, full of bread, egges, fiſh, cheeſe, fruit, and other thinges, which a lady had ſent them three leagues diſtant from the Couent▪ which being ioyfully receaued by the porter and ſett on the table, euery one admired thereatt. By meane of this miracle they vnderſtood the wordes of the S. when he bad that the care ſhould be left to God: And when he ſmiled, the Guardian alſo ſending him word that he was aſhamed to entertaine the ſaid Phiſician hauing nothing wherewith all. So they were more confirmed in the beleefe they had of the propheticall ſpiritt of S. Francis, and the Phiſician ſaid to the Religious: verily Brethren we doe not know the ſanctity of our Father: For I ſtayed only in reſpect of him, reioycing to eat this day with you by deuotion, of your groſſe refection: but he hath wayted then to inuite me, when he knew by prophetical ſpiritt, that here would be a plentifull repaſt. The Religious replyed that it was particuler vnto him, to foretell what was to ſucceed, without euer fayling therin.
               
               
                  Of other like caſes of Propheſie.
                  THE CXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  A Religious of the Order deluded by the deuill, forſooke Religion and vnder coulour to liue more perfectly, became a Pilgrime. But committing manie offences, he reflected on his errour, and with great humllitie went to the holie Father, who ſeeingS. Franc. procured pardon of God for the Apostaſie of one of his Religious. him, ſhutt himſelfe into his celle (att the merueillous aſtoniſhment of all his Religious, for he accuſtomed to ſhew himſelfe verie milde and gracious to the penitentes that retourned vnto him) whence when he came foorth, his Religious demanded of him why he ſhutt himſelfe in: he anſweared that he ran to the armour of prayer, to aſsiſt that Religious &amp; to defend him from the handes of the deuill, whome he ſaw ouer him, and that he had preſentlie obtayned the victory. Retourning then towardes the ſaid Religious, Brother, ſaid he, our lord God hath pardonned thee: but be carefull that the deuill, vnder pretence of any other

ſanctitie deceaue thee not againe, and cauſe not thee, for any other ſtepmother what ſoeuer to forſake thy true mother: which he perfectlie obſerued, perſeuering in his Order all the time of his life.
                  
                     This that followeth is taken out of the 22. chapter of the ſixt booke, becauſe it is the beginning of the matter recounted, euen to the place here recorded.
                     The holie Father S. Francis paſsing through Tuſcane, Brother Macie his companion walked a litle before him to diſcouer the way, and comming into a parting way, where one might take his courſe either towardes Florence, Sienna, or Arezza, he asked S. Francis which way they ſhould tourne, who anſweared, as it ſhall pleaſe God. BrotherHow S. Francis made Br. Macie to tourne to know the will of God. Macie replyed, how ſhall God ſhew vs his will herein? By thee, ſaid the S. and withall commanded him vnder obedience to tourne and not to reſt, till he commanded him. Brother Macie was no leſſe ready to obey then he ſhould haue bin to commande, yea he tourned ſo much that he many times fell to the ground by the giddines he felt in his head with often tourning, and deſiſted not, though the paſſengers ſtayd to behold him, and derided him as an idiott, till S. Francis with a loud voice bid him to ſtay, which done, he asked him towardes what place he was tourned, and he anſweared, towardes Sienna. Goe on then to Sienna ſaid the holy Father: whither being come, the greater part of the nobles and gentlemen mett them and with exceeding deuotion accompayned them to the Biſhopperick, where the holy Father S. Francis preached vpon occaſion of two men that by ciuill ſedition had then bin slaine. And by his preaching he ſo wrought, that before his departure he reconciled them all: by which worcke, more diuine thē humane, it manifeſtly appeared that it was Goddes will he ſhould come thither. This holy Father finding himſelfe loaden with the prayſes of men (which he eſteemed an intollerable burden) he one day priuatly departed the towne, without ſpeaking a word to any man.
                  
                  
                     The ſequel of the aforeſaid hundredth chapter.
                     Brother Macie thefore that followed him murmured a litle to himſelfe, att his litle good manners in departing from the Biſhop without taking leaue of him, &amp; for making him turne as a foole in the middes of the way the day before: but perceauing afterwardes that it was a deceiptS. Franc. knew the thoughts of Br. Macie thatmurred with him ſelfe. of the deuill, he very bitterlie reprehended himſelfe affirming that he deſerued hell, for preſuming to iudge of the S. as oppoſing againſt the diuine worckes by him wrought, as a verie true Angell of the liuing God, in ſuch or like manner accuſing himſelfe. The holie Father tourning to him, ſaid: Proceed bouldelie, Brother Macie, for this thy laſt diſcourſe is euen ſo of God, as thy former was of the de
                        
                           •
                        ill. Brother Macie then ſo much more humbled himſelfe as he more

approued the admirable ſanctity of his holy Father.
                     An other Religious had a great deſire to conuerſe with him, but he abſtayned fearing to offend him by knowing his great imperfections: doubting withall, that offending the purity of his ſoule, he ſhould alſo vtterlie looſe his fauour. Theſe thoughtes being entierly reuealed vnto S. Francis, he one day called him to him, &amp; ſaid: Brother, I know you deſire to conuerſe with me, ſpeake therfore, and ſay freely what you will, and come to me when you deſire: by thisOf one of his Religious that was troubled to frequent his company. meane the Religious was ſo ſecured, as he remayned more affected vnto him. Theſe thinges wherby the prophetie of the holie Father Sainct Francis was generallie manifeſted, are almoſt infinite: therefore hauing hereafter recited two or three other, we ſhall haue ended all that may be collected of all authors. God knoweth the reſt.
                  
                  
                     How S. Francis propheſied the Papacy to Nicolas the 3. when he was yet a child. This is taken out of the 9. chapter of the 9. booke, and here put in his place.
                     Mathew Rimido a Romane gentleman, was an affectionate freind vnto the holy Father Sainct Francis: yea did afterward take the habitt of the Rule of the third Order, this man hauing one morning inuited Sainct Francis to dine with him, and preſenting vnto him his ſonne Iohn Caietan, then a litle child, who was afterward Pope Nicolas the third, to giue him hs benediction: the holy Father tooke him in his armes, embraced and kiſſed him very louingly, and recommended vnto him his Religion, which procured great aſtoniſhment and abondance of teares of the Father preſent, and much more when he more plainly told him, that the child ſhould not be Religious in habitt, but much in deuotion, and principall Lord of this world, and protectour of his Religion. The holy Father vſed one of his ordinarie exerciſes of humility with this gentleman, out of the very harty loue he boare to holy pouerty: which was, that being inuited by him and comming att ſuch time as he was not att home, where certaine new ſeruantesS. Franc. did eat with the poore att his freīds houſe. not knowing him gaue diuers poore people to eat within a Court, he likewiſe receaued almoſe and did eat togeather with them. The Lord Mathew comming home, and finding Sainct Francis to eat among the poore, he incontinently ſate downe on the ground with him: where he would in like ſort eat with the poore, and the S. to whome he ſaid: Father, ſith you would not dine with me, I muſt dine with you.
                  
                  
                     The ſequel of the ſaid hundredth chapter.
                     Brother Iohn Bonello, a Religious of great perfection, held a generall

chapter in Prouence, in the monaſtery of Arles, where he was ProuinciallS. Franc. liuing &amp; being in Italy appeared to a Religious in the prouinciall chapter held att Arles in Prouince. Miniſter. S. Antony of Padua preached att that chapter vpon the title of the holy croſſe. It there happened then that a Religious Preiſt called Brother Monaldus of a very exemplare life, ſaw ouer the dore of the Chapter in the aire, S. Francis, with his handes and feet ſtretched on a croſſe: and as he was, he bleſſed all the Religious, looſing his right hand from the croſſe, whiles S. Antony moſt profoundlie expounded the ſaid title of the croſſe. Wherefore, the ſpirituall conſolation which they all then felt in themſelues was ſuch and ſo great, that albeit Brother Monaldus alone ſaw the ſaid S. preſent, neuertheles they all did participate of the grace: in ſuch ſort that if any one would not haue beleeued the relation of Brother Monaldus, he was conſtrayned to be aſſured thereof, by that which he had felt in his hart. Beſides many other like apparitions of the ſaid S. by diuine permiſsion, wherein God would demōſtrat how neere our ſoule is (when ſhe wil receaue his grace) vnto the diuine light, and eternall wiſdome, by communication wherof, ſhe ariſeth from the world, to vnite herſelfe with God, making the humble and poore of ſpiritt, Prophettes, reuealing high myſteries vnto them, as it made Dauid, one of the principall prophetes, afterwardes S. Peter and the other Apoſtles, according to the ſaying of the Goſpell: Many thinges I haue to ſay to you: but you cannot beare them now:
                        Iohn. 16. 
                        But when he, the ſpiritt of truth, commeth, he shall teach you all truth: and in theſe latter dayes, his humble and ſimple ſeruant S. Francis. For as he did choſe the Apoſtles, ſimple and idiotes, in regard of the learning of the world, he neuertheles made them famous by doctrine and diuine worckes; and the Sheepheard Dauid, to feed the ſheep of the ſinagogue tranſported out of Egipt, and S. Peter the fiſher, to fill the nettes of the holy church, with the multitude of faithfull Chriſtians: ſo he would haue Sainct Francis a merchaunt, to teach vs to traficke and negociate for this precious ſtone of the Euangelicall life, ſelling all his goodes, and diſtributing it to the poore for his loue: and to enrich his church with ſoules redeemed by this holy meane.
                  
                  
                     How the bleſsed Father Sainct Francis, renounced and rendred in the handes of his Brethren, the office of Generall of the Order, and inſtituted a Vicar Generall in his place. This was the 31. chapter of the ſecond booke improperly, and therfore, to follow the true Order of his life, we haue here put it in his place.
                     This B. Father was ſo zealous of obediēce, &amp; eſpecially of that his moſt holy humility, that he could in no ſort diſpoſe himſelf to cōmaūd: ſo that it was irkſome vnto him to performe the office appertayning therevnto,

as to haue the chardge of gouerning ſo many thouſandes of Religious, to commaund and reprehend, to aduiſe and correct, to giue ordonnances, and to chaſtice the offenders. Therfore, he reſolued to renounce the office of Miniſter Generall, as well for the cauſe hereafter alleadged, as the better by example to teach obedience vnto his children. Beſides he found himſelfe too ſickly, ſo that he could not apply himſelfe to that office as was requiſite: and yet would not omitt the rigour of his penance, to conſerue his body, yea he was better content to continue ſicke, then by neuer ſo litle relenting his auſteritie, to be cured of his infirmities: the occaſion was reaſonable, to free himſelfe piously of ſuch a chardge. And therfore, att the generall chapter held two yeares before he receaued of our Lord IESVS CHRIST his ſacred ſtigmates, he publikelie renounced the office of Miniſter Generall, not without the exceeding greife of all the Religious, who by all meanes refuſing, during his life, to admitt any other Miniſter, he was conſtrayned to conſtitute a Vicar Generall, that gouerned the Order in his name; To this effect, he made choiſe of Brother Peter Catanio, his ſecond ſonne in Religion, a man of great prudence, and very expert to gouerne: to whome the holie Father promiſed his cheiffeſt obedience, and beſides to him that ſhould be conſtituted his Guardian. Which all the Religious ſeeing, they began bitterlie to weepe eſteeming they ſhould continue as orphanes, without the ordinary gouernment of their beloued Father, who comforting them the beſt he could, his handes ioyned, and his eyes eleuated towardes heauen he ſaid: My God, I recommende vnto thee this family, which to this houre thou haſt recommended vnto me: For now, by reaſon of mine infirmities, other impedimentes, and iuſt cauſes to thee knowne, being vnable henceforward to haue care of them, I haue committed them to a Vicar Generall, and to other Prouinciall Miniſters, who ſhalbe obliged to yeld thee a very exact account of them att the terrible day of the great iudgement; if they chaunce to periſh by their negligence or euill example. And ſo the holy Father S. Francis thenceforward perſeuered to be alwayes ſubiect, euen to the day of his death; ſurpaſsing thē all in humilitie. Yet did he neuer faile to be very zealous in aſsiſting and with his vtmoſt to fauour his Order, euen during the life of his firſt Vicar, who died att the end of the ſecond yeare of his Prelature, in the Monaſtery of our Lady of Angels, S. Francis not being there when he was buryed. His body wrought ſo many miracles, that an infinite multitude of people from all partes flocked thither leauing a very great quantity of almoſe vnto the monaſterie. The holie Father therfore comming thither, and vnable to endure either the one or the other, the former for diſtracting them all, and the latter for relaxation of the order

which he forſaw would grow of ſuch quantity of almoſe, he wēt to the ſepulcher where ſo many miracles were wrought: and to the deceaſed heS. Franc. commandeth a S. to worck no more miracles and he obeyeth. vttered theſe wordes: My deerlie beloued Brother, as thou haſt alwayes obeyed me during thy life, we being now by thine interceſsion moleſted with ſuch a world of peopl, thou muſt alſo obey me after thy death. I therefore cōmand thee on obedience that thou worcke no more miracles, ſith by them we are in dāger to be ruinated. The deceaſed (which is admirable to conſider) ceaſſed vpon this commandement to worcke any more miracles: ſuch is the vertue &amp; power of holy obediēce, in a true and good Prelat, &amp; in a true and good ſubiect, that it extendeth not onlie on earth and during life, but euen in heauen &amp; after death. Yea by it, ceaſſed the glorie and eminencie of miracles, that exalt the honour of the liuing God, the more to magnifie him by the exerciſe of holie pouertie and the quiett retire from a turbulent applauſe of the world.
                  
                  
                     How S. Francis instituted his ſecond Vicar Generall. This was the 32. chapter of the ſecond book, but hither transferred to obſerue due order of the hiſtory.
                     The miracles of Brother Peter Catanio, being now ceaſſed as we haue ſaid, the holie Father S. Francis, by aduiſe of the miniſters, in place of the ſaid deceaſſed, ſubrogated Brother Elias, a man of ſinguler prudence, and verie learned, for which he was reſpected, not only of his Religious, but euen of ſeculer perſons, Prelates and Princes. He gouerned as long as the holy Father liued, who the more to honour him, gaue him the title of Generall, though he were not ſo, for the reaſon aforeſaid that the Religious would neuer accept other Generall then S. Francis during his life. The ſaid Brother Elias attributing the ſaid honour vnto himſelfe and not to God, he made him know with all that his deepe prudence according to the world, was before him but a very ſottiſh folly: for riſing into pride, he fell as an other Lucifer, from ſuch an hight to the deepeſt profunditie of theſe worldlie miſeries, the great mercie of God, by the prayers of the S. redeeming him from eternall puniſhment as hereafter ſhall appeare.
                  
                  
                     This that followeth is the reſidue of 85. chapter already past, which we purpoſely omitted, as no proper place for it, as mayHow much the third generall of the order of Freer Miners forgat himſelfe. eaſily be iudged.
                     The holy Father S. Francis being att table together with many of his Religious, he tooke ſome of the moſt remarkable in humility &amp; ſimplicity that ſate neere vnto him by the handes, and tourning towardes the ſaid Brother Helias, he willed him graciously to honour thoſe other learned &amp; noble Brethren ſitting there. Brother Helias, extremly puffed vp in pride, without any reſpect thus anſweared: O Brother Francis, I doubt not but by your ſimplicity and careleſſe negligence, you

will ruinate this whole Order. The holy Father more curious of his ſaluation then of himſelfe, anſweared him; O miſerable wretch, this pride which thou wilt not caſt off, and this kinde of thy paſsionate behauiour to ſuch euill purpoſe, wilbe occaſion that thou ſhalt dye out of the Order. Which ſo happened, for he died out of the Order, in the Court of the Emperour Frederick the ſecond, who was excommunicated.
                     An other time the holy Father propheſied in this māner of this Vicar General; It hapened that Brother Helias was once called for att the dore of the Couent, by one that affirmed himſelfe to be an Angell, ſent vnto him frō God, and the porter did him the meſſage, telling him that an Angell in humane ſhape expected him att the gate: muſing therfore what this might be, he was a long time perplexed, yet att lenght he went thither,An Angel came to ſpeak with him. and the Angell propoſed vnto him this doubt, whither it were lawfull for the profeſſours of the goſpell, to eat of what ſoeuer was indiffefently preſented vnto them or no. Att this propoſition he reſted vtterly confounded, for he had purpoſed to be author of a new conſtitution in the Order: which was that the Freres might not eat fleſh, againſt their firſt holy Rule: wherfore he rudely and cholerickly ſhutt the dore againſt the Angell, and retourned into the Couēt. Which being reported vnto S. Francis, he incontinently aroſe frō prayer and went to his Vicar, whome he ſharply reprehēded ſaying: Brother Helias you haue done ill in ſhutting the gate againſt the Angels, when God ſendeth thē to iuſtruct you. I tell you therefore it is impoſsible for you to perſeuer ſtable in the Order, with this pride. The holy Father ſpake thus much vnto him becauſe it had bin reuealed vnto him that he ſhould die out of the Order, and beſides, that he ſhould be damned, in reſpect wherof he did euer after ſo diſaffect him, that he could not endure to behold him, which was not long vnperceaued of Brother Helias: and therfore being verie cautelous and ſubtill, he ſo laboured and wrought by ſignes of humility and importunity that he gott knowledge of all, wherewith he was ſo terrified and amazed, that with abondant effuſion of teares demaunding pardon of S. Francis, he neuer ceaſſed to ſupplicate him, that conſidering he was alſo, by the paſsion of our lord, one of the ſheep of his fold, he would not abandon him, but that like a good Paſtour as he was, he would pleaſe to reduce the ſtrayed ſheep vnto the flock, and ſo deliuer him from eternall death; alleadgeing that vpon chaunge of the ſinners life, God could eaſily reuoke his ſentence. Father ſaid he, ſuch is my confidence and deuotion vnto you, that were I in hell it ſelfe, I would hope to come foorth vpon your prayers for me: ſo that I am fully aſſured that if you pleaſe for me to implore the diuine mercie, my ſentence ſhall be reuoked. The holie Father, moued by theſe prayers, could not att lenght denie him; ſo that with a very great feruour

he entierly caſt himſelfe into the armes of God, in ſuch ſort praying forS. Franc. prayed for him. this loſt ſoule, that God anſweared him, that he ſhould doe penance for his ſinnes, and ſhould not be damned, but for dying out of the Order he could not be otherwiſe ſatisfied, and ſo it arriued, for he dyed out of the Order, with manie ſignes of contrition, according to the opinion of ſome in the habitt.
                  
                  
                     This that folloueth is of the aforeſaid 32. chapter of the ſecond booke, the better to obſerue the Order of all that appartaineth to renountiation of the office of Generall.
                     
                        Why S. Francis renounced the office of Generall. The holy Father S. Francis being by a Religious freind of his entreated to tell him what had moued him to make that renountiation, and to committ it to the chardge of an other, as if they were not his children, who had bin ſuch made, nouriſhed and inſtructed by him, he anſweared: know my child that I loue you all more deerly then any man can imagine, and if all would follow my will, I would loue them more, and would not haue left their adminiſtration. But I haue bin cō
                        ſtrayned therevnto, becauſe there are many Religious that eſteeme more of the aduice of ſome of their ſuperiours, by whome they are drawne to other matters, by example of the auncient, and which is directly cō
                        trary to my rule, and ſo they make very litle eſteeme of mine aduertiſmētes: but in the end, they wil more euidētly find their errour. The holy Father being on a time as it were oppreſſed with his infirmities, and hearing ſome ſpeake of the aforeſaid matters, and particulerly of the ouer-much indulgence of the ſuperiours, and of the euill examples they gaue their ſubiectes, he lifted vp his head and cryed out, Ah! ah! couer me, couer me, who are they that withdraw the Religious from mine Order, and from my way, and my examples? If I once goe to the Generall chapter, I will ſhew my Brethren what is my deſire, and mine intention, that they permitt not themſelues to be deluded.
                     Being alſo an other time ſick, a Religious ſaid vnto him: O Father, it ſeemed that att the beginning our Religiō we ſtriued to liue in al auſterity and pouerty, we were poore in our habitt, in our diet, in our dwelling, in our moueables, in our bookes, and in all our other corporal neceſsities, for which we tooke no care: by reaſō of this pouerty exteriour, the interiour daily proceeded frō good to better, becauſe we were al of the ſame feruour, of the ſame will, with one cōſent cōſpiring to the entier obſeruā
                        ce of our rule, and alwayes to giue good exāple to our neighbour, finally we obſerued the goſpell the moſt exactly that we could. But of later time, it ſeemeth that the purity of this our firſt vocatiō, is much deminiſhed, vpon excuſe that it cā no longer be obſerued as before, by reaſon of the great multitude of brethren: yea there are ſome that beleeue that the people are much more edified by this theire moderne and new

inobſeruance and mortification of their proper will and of their ſences, then they were when they all liued in ſuch deep auſterity of life: and they thinck it a matter more Religious to liue after this new manner, thē according to the ancient and former, which they hold for crowned, as proceeding of ſimplicitie and holy pouertie, which were the foundations of this our holy Religion. Now perceauing this, and beleuing that you likewiſe perceaue it, and are therewith exceedingly diſpleaſed, I meruaile you doe not labour with all ſpeed to hinder the further progreſſe of this euill, nor doe correct it whiles you haue power, and meane to doe it.
                     S. Francis hauing with great affliction of ſpiritt heard this long diſcourſe, thus anſweared: Our Lord IESVS CHRIST pardon you that which you ſuppoſe I ought to doe, which I am not obliged to haue care of, neither by chardge, nor by office: for whiles I was Generall, though from the beginning of my conuerſion I haue almoſt continued in ſicknes, I haue not yet failed either in cogitations or effectes, to ſatisfie my duety, both by example and gouernment. But hauing well conſidered that God did daily encreaſe the nomber of Religious, and that they already began to leaue the ſecure, ſtrict, and difficult way, wherin they firſt walked, and in ſuch ſortas you ſay ſtrayed from it, without correcting themſelues notwithſtanding all my demonſtrations, predications, and good edification that I gaue them, I then reſolued to leaue the office of Generall, as I did, and though when I renounced it, I failed not att the chapter to excuſe my ſelfe by mine infirmities, as was partly true: alleadgeing that by meanes therof I could no longer diſchardge ſo burdenſome an office: Neuertheles my ſonne, I aſſure you if the Religious would now liue conformably to my rule, and to my pious intentiō, I would againe accept the office of Generall, and would excute it ſo long as it ſhould pleaſe God to giue me life: conſidering that ſo, the care of that chardge would not be painfull vnto me, for certaine it is, that whē the faithfull ſubiect knoweth the good will of his ſuperiour, he ſtriueth to obey him in euery thing, ſo that it is no great difficulty to gouerne him, yea I ſhould reioyce and be exceedingly comforted, in their ſpirituall progreſſe, and in the honour that therby redoundeth to his diuine Maieſty: and though I ſhould be cōtinually ſicke on my bed, yet ſhould it not be tedious nor troubleſome vnto me to giue them content in all thinges: but becauſe I ſee I can no longer diſchardge mine office, which is ſpirituall, and oppoſite to vices, in correcting them either by loue, or by aduertiſſement, I will not retourne (to the chardge) to be their executioner, chaſticing them with the rodde of diſciplin, as the princes of the world doe iuſtly correct their rebelles: neuertheles I hope in God that the inuiſible ennemies the deuils, that are his executioners to chaſtice

the diſobedientes in this world and in the other, will alſo chaſtice the tranſgreſſours of the vow of their profeſsion; therby to their ſhame and forciblie, to make them retourne to their firſt vocation: to this effect I will not omitt to aſsiſt them whiles I liue, att leaſt by prayers and example, ſith otherwiſe I cannot, and to inſtruct them the ſecure way, which I haue learned of my God, as I haue formerly done, that they may haue no excuſe before his diuine maieſty. No further doe I hold my ſelfe obliged. Such was his anſweare, which ſatisfying the Religious, procured an ineſtimable greife to all the hearers: wherby it alſo manifeſtlie appeared, what reaſon the S. had to leaue them, and what occaſion they had to know themſelues, and by a pious acknowledgement of their fault and true repentance, to haue recourſe vnto him.

                  Of the plenary indulgence graunted by Ieſus Chriſt to the Church of our Lady of Angels of Portiuncula.
                  THE FIRST CHAPTER.
                  
                     THE more the glorious Father S. Francis profited in perfection, and endeauoured to vnite himſelfe with God, the more did he poure out teares, and felt intollerable greife att the loſſe of ſoules redeemed by the price of the precious bloud of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST. Wherfore not ceaſsing to deſire mercie of God for1223. Three yeares before his death. ſinners, as he thirſted to haue all ſaued, the yeare of grace 1223. being to that effect in prayer, an Angell appeared vnto him, and bid him, incontinentlie to repaire vnto the church, becauſe our Lord IESVS CHRIST with his glorious Mother and a great number of Angels there expected him. Hauing receaued this gracious embaſſadge, he haſtened thither and there found our Sauiour ſitting in a Royall throne, on the high altare, and the Virgin Mary att his right hand, enuironned with an innumerable multitude of bleſſed ſpirittes. The holy Father incontinentlie falling proſtrate on the earth, heard the diuine voice of IESVS, ſaying: Francis, Know that I haue

heard thy feruent prayers: and becauſe I know with what ſolicitude thou and thy Religious procure the ſaluation of ſoules, aske me what grace thou wilt for their ſoules benefitt, and I will graunt it thee. The S. being by ſuch an anſweare emboldened, moſt humbly anſweared: My Lord IESVS CHRIST, I miſerable and vnworthy ſinner, with the greateſt reuerence I can, require of thy diuine maieſty, that it will pleaſe thee ſo much to fauour all Chriſtian people, as to graunt them a generall pardon and plenary indulgence of all their ſinnes; I meane to all them that ſhall enter into this church, confeſſed and contrite. I alſo beſeech thee, O glorious holy Virgin mother, and our Aduocatrix, that it would pleaſe thee to make interceſsion to thy moſt gracious ſonne for me and for all Chriſtian ſinners. Our Lady was inſtantlie moued with theſe wordes, and began in this ſort to pray our Redeemer in his behalfe: O my moſt high Lord and ſonne of my bowels, I beſeech thee graunt vnto this thy faithfull ſeruaunt this grace which he hath demaunded with ſo great a zeale of the ſaluation of ſoules, which thy ſelfe aboue all other thinges diſireſt. My God graunt him this grace in this place, to thine honour and the edification of thy holy church. Our Lord ſodenlie anſweared: Francis that which thou demaundeſt is great: but this thy deſire conformable to mine, deſerueth much more, and therfore I graunt thy requeſt. But goe to my Vicar, to whome I haue giuen al power of vnbinding and binding here on earth, and in my name demaund it of him, which ſaid, he diſappeared. The Religious that had their celles neere therevnto, ſaw the ſplendour, and heard ſome ſpeach, but durſt not approach for reuerence and great feare that poſſeſſed them.
                  The holy Father S. F. hauing thācked God, presētly called Bro. Macie, in whoſe cōpany he wēt to Peruſia, where thē was Pope Honorius with his court: befor whoſe holines he thus ſpake: Holy F. I haue reeſtabliſhed a church that was very ruinous &amp; deſert, called S. Mary of portiūcula, very neere vnto the citty of Aſsiſe, wherin are reſidēt your Religious the Frere Min. I beſeech your holines by our Redeemer I. C. &amp; his moſt glorious mother, to voutſafe for the benefitt of the ſoules of all faithful Chriſtiās, to graūt a plenary indulgēce and remiſsion of all their ſinnes, to all them that ſhall viſitt this church in good eſtate, without giuing any almoſe in the ſame. The Pope anſweared him that the Apoſtolike ſea did not accuſtome to graunt indulgēs without giuing of almoſe, becauſe it will that they be gayned by thē. He thē asked him for how many yeares he deſired the indulgēce S. Francis anſweared: Holy Father I deſire not yeares, but ſoules? How ſoules ſaid the Pope. S. Frācis replyed: I require that euery Chriſtian confeſſed and contrite, that ſhall come to viſitt the ſaid Church, receaue plenarie abſolution in earth and in heauen, and that

of whatſoeuer ſinnes he ſhall haue committed from his Baptiſme to that very houre. I require not this in myne owne name, but in our Lord IESVS CHRIST, who hath ſent me to your Holines. Which the Pope hearing, inſpired of the holy Ghoſt, he thus ſpake thrice with a loud voice, I am content to graunt it as thou haſt demaunded it. But the Cardinals preſent, aduiſed the Pope to conſider well what he graunted: becauſe by that act he would deſtroy the indulgences of the holy land, and of Sainct Peter and S. Paul att Rome, which would no longer be regarded. The Pope anſweared, that he would not reuoke what he had att that preſent graunted. They replyed that att leaſt it were requiſit he ſhould limitt the ſaid indulgence to a certaine time, and moderate it to a certaine prefixed day of the yeare. The Pope thenConfirmation of the ſaid indulgē
                        ce by the Pope. ſaid: We graunt to all faithfull Chriſtians, that being truely confeſſed and contrite ſhall enter into the Church of our Lady of Angels, plenary indulgence and abſolution both of paine and fault: and we will that the ſame be of force for euer, for one entier day, that is, from the firſt euenſong till the ſunne ſitting of the day following. Which the holy Father Sainct Francis hauing obtayned, he kiſſed his feet: then demaunded his benediction: which receaued, he aroſe to depart. But the Pope recalling him, ſaid: Whither goeſt thou ſimple man, what ſpecialtie haſt thou of the indulgence obtayned? The holy Father anſweared that his word ſhould ſuffice: and beſides, that this worck was of God, and therfore, it ſhould be publiſhed and ſupported by his diuine Maieſty: and withall, that he would haue no other Bull, but the Virgin Mary, IESVS CHRIST for Notary, and the Angels for witneſſes. Which ſaid, he departed, and by the way ſtayed at the hoſpitall of leapers, where making his accuſtomed prayer: it was reuealed vnto him by our Lord IESVS CHRIST, that the indulgence which he had procured, was confirmed in heauen, wherof hauing aduertiſed his companion, they both retourned to giue thanckes to his diuine maieſty.
               
               
                  How the day of the ſaid indulgence was miraculouſly aſsigned from heauen.
                  THE II. CHAPTER.
                  
                     The deuil tempteth S. Francis. THe day wherein the ſaid indulgence was to be gained, was not yet prefixed: S. Francis being come to the Couent of our Lady of Angels, and being about midnight in prayer in his celle,

the deuill appeared vnto him in forme of an Angell, ſaying: O pooreto make him leaue prayer. Francis, why ſeekeſt thou to dye before the time? why doeſt thou conſume chy complexion by ſo long watchinges? knoweſt thou not that the night is made to sleepe, and that sleepe is the principall nouriſhment of the body? thou art not yet old, why then wilt thou thus kill thy ſelfe? Were it not better for thee to conſerue thy life, therein to ſerue thy God longer, and to profitt the holy church and thine Order? Beleeue me therfore, and ſpend not thy life in ſuch ſuperfluous prayers and watchinge; only mediocrity pleaſeth God. Which the holie Father hauing heard, and knowing it to be a deluſionS. Franc. caſt, turned and wallowed himſelfe all naked in a bush full of thornes. of the deuill that tempted him exteriourlie by his voice, and interiourlie by his ſuggeſtion, ariſing from his prayer, he ſtripped himſelfe naked, then caſt himſelfe into a buſh full of very ſharpe pricking thornes, wherin he tourned and wallowed till the bloud euery where trickled downe, and doeing the ſame, he thus diſcourſed vnto his body: Ah my body! it had bin better for thee to contemplat the paſsion of IESVS CHRIST then to endure this, for hauing in vayne repined and ſearched the delightes of the world. Thus diſcourſing, a great light appeared vnto him in the middes of the ice that was there, (it was in Ianuary) and in the buſh of thornes he ſaw very beautifull roſes white and vermillion, and a venerable troupe of Angels that filled all the way euen to his church, and one of them called him, ſaying: Come Francis, for our Lord expectethe thee, and in an inſtant he miraculously found himſelfe cloathed. So knowing him thatS. Franc. gathered vermilliō &amp; white roſes in Ianuary. called him, he gathered twelue white roſes and twelue vermillion, then went through the way all tapeſtred with Angelicall ſpirittes towardes his ſweet Lord, before whoſe feet he fell in great reuerence, and then preſented theſe twelue roſes vnto his diuine Maieſtie, that appeared ſitting on the ſaid high altare, as the other time accompanied with his glorious mother, and aſsiſted with an innumerable multitude of Angels, to whome he ſaid.
                  Moſt gracious lord &amp; gouernour of heauen &amp; earth, ſith it hath pleaſed thee to graunt me the plenary indulgence for this church, I moſt hū
                     bly beſeech thee to voutſafe alſo aſsigne the day wherein it ſhalbe gayned. I herein coniure thee by the merittes of thy moſt glorious mother our aduocatrice, that it pleaſe thee to appoint the ſame by thy diuine mouth. Our Lord anſweared him: I am content to ſatisfie thy deſire: and therfore, I aſsigne thee the firſt day of Auguſt from the euenſong of that feaſt, wherin is made memory how I deliuered myne Apoſtle S. Peter from the chaines of Herod, vntill the ſunne ſittiug of the day following. But tell me if thou pleaſe my Lord, ſaid the holy Father after he had giuen him thanckes, how ſhall the world

know it, and knowing it, how ſhall it beleeue it? Our Sauiour replyed▪ I will conſider therof in time conuenient: but in meane while retourne to my vicare, and carry with thee ſome Religious that haue ſeene this apparition, and giue him ſome of theſe Roſes, and he ſhall incontinently confirme thee the day, and cauſe the indulgence to be publiſhed. The holy Father vpon obedience tooke three white and three vermillon roſes, and whiles our lord diſappeared, the Angels ſung. Te Deum laudamus and S. Francis gaue him thanckes, who preſently went to his holynes with Brother Bernard Quintaualle, Brother Angelus of Rieta, and Brother Ruffinus who had ſeene this great viſion. Being before the dore of the church, he found the Pope retourned from Rome, to whome he yelded account of what our lord had told him, calling his companions for witneſſes, and preſenting him the ſaid Roſes. The Pope hauing attentiuely heard him, and being vnable to ſatisfie himſelfe with beholding the ſaid Roſes, ſo freſh and ſweet, and therwithall ſo rauiſhed, as he could no longer containe himſelfe, he ſayed: Ah good God, ſuch roſes in Ianuary, to make me beleue what they haue ſayd! theſe alone are ſufficient: therfore he ſaid to S. Francis, I will conſult with my Cardinals how thy requeſt may be accompliſhed, then will giue anſweare, and with thoſe wordes diſmiſſed him. The next day he repaired againe vnto his holines in the Conſiſtory, where by the Popes cōmandement he once more recounted all the ſucceſſe, and the day which God had prefixed vnto him: The Pope thē ſaid, ſith we arecertaine of the will of our lord IESVS CHRIST the true and ſoueraine Biſhop, whoſe place, though vnworthy, we hold on earth, we alſo in his behalfe doe graunt, the plenary indulgence for perpetuity, to the foreſaid church on the day before mentioned.
               
               
                  How the ſaid indulgence was published in the church of S. Mary of Angels.
                  THE III. CHAPTER.
                  BVt that ſo great an indulgēce might be publiſhed by Apoſtolical authority, the Pope wrote to diuers Biſhoppes of the valley of Spoletū, and particulerly to the Biſhop of Aſsi
                        •
                     e, within whoſe dioceſe the ſaid church was, and to the Biſhoppes of Folliniū, of Agubio, and of Nocera, that they ſhould be all preſent att S. Mary of Angels the firſt day of Auguſt, to conſecrate and publiſh the ſaid indulgēce, that there had bin graunted by diuine reuelatiō and Apoſtolicall permiſsion, att the requeſt of the holy Father S. Francis: who taking the ſaid letters and thancking the Pope, he departed with his companios with great reuerence and humility to deliuer thē to the ſaid Biſhoppes, praying them in the name of God and his holines that they would not faile on the ſaid

day to be preſēt in his Church, there to performe what was enioyned thē. After that, he retourned to Aſsiſiū where he cauſed to be prepared a great ſcaffold for that effect: that the ſayd Biſhoppes might the more commodiously and better be vnderſtood of the people. The day determined being come, the Biſhoppes entred into the ſaid Church, where being aſcēded on the ſcaffold, they ſaid to S. Fran. that though they were come thither to publiſh the indulgence as they were ready to doe; yet they thought it more requiſite, that himſelfe ſhould firſt declare vnto the people, whē and in what ſort it had bin graūted him by God and the Pope, which done, they would confirme it. The holy Father anſweared thē: though I be not worthy to ſpeake in your preſēce: yet as moſt obedient ſeruāt, I will performe your cōmand. Aſcēding therfore in the pulpitt, he made a ſermō to the people that thither by Goddes prouidence were abondātly flocked from all the neighbour places, with an extreme feruour explicating vnto thē this ſo great treaſure, which he performed with ſuch deep doctrine, that it ſeemed rather the diſcourſe of an Angell, thē of a mā vnlearned as he was. Att the end of this ſermō, he denoūced vnto the people in the name of God &amp; his moſt ſacred mother, the indulgēce, in theſe words: Whoſoeuer being truely cōtrite &amp; cōfeſſed, shall viſitt this church the firſt day of August, from the euenſong therof, and the night and daie of the feaſt it ſelfe to the ſunne ſetting, he shall gaine a plenary indulgence, which is graunted him firſt by God, &amp; ſecōdarily by his Vicare Pope Honorius, and the ſame to cōtinue for euer on that day. The biſhopps there preſēt to cō
                     firme the ſpeech S. Frācis, would not accord to that for euer. The biſhop of Aſsiſiū therfore cōfirming the indulgēce to the people, purpoſing to limittA miracle in publication of this indulgence. it to ten yeares, could neuer vtter it: but was cōſtrayned to ſay: for euer: the like happened vnto the other biſhoppes. This miracle being very euidētly knowne vnto the people, it encreaſed their faith, &amp; preuēted the doubt which ſome might haue had, that God himſelfe had not graū
                     ted this indulgēce. Therefore the publicatiō being ended, the biſhoppes being exceedingly amazed att the miracle, did with great ſolēnity conſecrate the ſaid church, which continued for euer endued with this great treaſure, to the glory of our lord, his holy mother the virgin Mary, and his ſeruant S. Francis, and to the ſoules health of all Chriſtians.
               
               
                  Of certaine miracles wrought by Godin confirmatiō of the ſaid indulgence.
                  THE IV. CHAPTER.
                  IT pleaſed God beſides the fore mentioned, to cauſe this ſo great indulgence to be beleeued and reuerenced in due mannner, for the publike good, by ſuch miracles and reuelations as we ſhall now relate. The yeare following a great number of people being

come to gaine the ſaid indulgence whiles they watched by night in prayer vnto God in the ſaid church, there aroſe in a moment ſuch a rumour among the people there aſſembled, that the Religious who were att reſt, were awakened therwith. Comming therfore into the church theyA doue was ſeen to fly in the aforeſaid Church the day of the ſaid indulgence. ſaw a Doue whiter then ſnow, that flew fiue times about the Church. One of them ſtepping forward the better to ſee, came neere the high altare, where he found Brother Corrado of Offeida a right holy Religious, of an exceeding exemplare life and famous for miracles, whome he prayed to lett him better vnderſtand the occaſion of the great murmure that was among the people who verie pitifull cryed out. This venerable Father anſweared that he was content to tell him: conditionally that he would promiſe not to reueale it to any perſon during his life. Which being condicioned, he ſaid: I ſaw the Queene of heauen to diſcend, cloathed with an ineffable ſplendour as holding her Sonne in her armes, and to giue her holy benediction vnto all preſent: then this DoueThe Virgin Mary was likewiſe ſeene there. which was with her on the altare began to fly, to ſignifie the viſitation of God, it hath here flowne round about the church. Which the people ſeeing, though they knew not all, began thus to crye out towardes heauen. The ſame day the mother of our lord was ſeene to enter into the Church with the Religious, and to accompanie the ordinarie proceſsion, with a great troupe of Angels that ſung prayſes vnto God. This was ſeene by Religious of pious life, and alſo by certaine pilgrimes.
                  As (in the Marquiſat of Ancona) one coniured the deuill, that vehementlie afflicted a poore poſſeſſed woman, to enforce him to tell what courſe was to be vſed to expell him: he anſweared att lenght, that he tormented not the woman for any ſinne of hers, but onlie to the end God might be prayſed by her, and that therefore there was no other remedie to deliuer her, but to procure her to gaine the indulgence of our ladie of Angels; and that he ſpake thus much as forciblie cō
                     ſtrayned to ſpeake againſt him ſelfe: as he likewiſe confeſſed that by the ſame indulgence he loſt a great multitud of ſoules which he already held as his owne, by reaſon of the enormous ſinnes they had committed.The deuil cōfeſseth the vertue of this indulgēce. The woman was therfore with great affliction and greife brought to our ladie of Angels the verie day of the indulgence: and as ſoone as ſhe was entred the effect ſucceeded, for the deuill lifting her into the aire departed, and the poore woman fell as dead to the ground: But by the merittes of the glorious Virgin, ſhe incontinentlie aroſe verie ſound of bodie and ſoule, hauing bin confeſſed to gaine the indulgence.
                  There are beſides, manie true teſtimonyes to whome haue appeared the ſpirittes of diuers deceaſſed, reuealing vnto them, that hauing certaine

dayes before their death, gayned the ſaid indulgence, they were ſodenlie by the glorious Virgin Mother conducted into Paradice without feeling any paine of purgatorie: others alſo gayning this indulgence that was applyed vnto them by forme of ſuffrage after their death, by meane of ſome liuing freindes, were deliuered of the paines of Purgatorie, as by this enſuying diſcourſe ſhall appeare.
                  A Venetian Gentleman that was a verie ſpirituall Preiſt, deſiring to gaine this indulgence, as he prepared himſelfe to goe thither he fell ſicke and of the ſame ſicknes dyed: but before his death, he ſaid to a very freind of his: My good freinde, I deſire you to beleeue, that there is no man in the world of my kinred or whoſoeuer other, in whome I haue more confidence then in your ſelfe, nor of whome I hope to obtaine what I deſire for the ſaluation of my ſoule: I therfore pray you, that if it pleaſe God to call me vnto him, you will vndertake ſo much labour as to goe to our ladie of Angels, to gaine the plenaire indulgence for the benefitt of my ſoule: and to defray your chardges in the iorney, demaund what you will and I will giue it you, that the indulgence being mine, you receaue no detriment therby. This freind took what was requiſit for his expences and promiſed to goe. Now this Preiſt being dead, and the time of Pilgrimage being come, his deere freind, though he ſaw manie that prepared them ſelues to the iorney, he, as if he had made no promiſe, deferred his iorney, purpoſing with himſelfe to goe the yeare following, which is a thing but too ordinarie to ingratefull perſons, kinred and freindes neglecting and forgetting the poore decaſſed; the Preiſt appeared to this vnworthy freind in his sleep the ſame night that he had made the foreſaid purpoſe, and with an angry countenance reprehending him, he ſaid: Goe on thy iorney now with ſuch as prepare themſelues therto. He awaking determined to doe that for feare, which he had neglected to doe for reſpect of amitye. Hauing effected the promiſe, the ſame day that he entred into the church and gayned the indulgence for the deceaſed, the Preiſt in the night enſuying appeared vnto him, not as before in choller, but bright and reſplendent as the ſunnet and thancked him and reuealed vnto him that then when he entred into the church, he entred into Paradice.
               
               
                  Of other miracles of the ſame indulgence.
                  THE V. CHAPTER.
                  THis famous indulgence being diuulged ouer almoſt al Chriſtendom, there departed from Sclauonia about twenty pilgrimes to gaine this Iubileye: but landing att Ancona, and there hauing

viſited the principall churches, they repayred to a monaſterie, where were ſhewed them many precious reliques. The Sacriſtine, that ſhewed thē asked thē whither they went in Pilgrimage: they anſweared, to our Ladie of Angels, to gaine the indulgence wherof the day approached. The Religious then ſaid: O ſimple people to endure heat, incommodities, and trauailes, without anie benefitt: for there is no ſuch indulgence as is ſpoaken of, or att leaſt there is no authenticall bulle of the Pope extant therof, I blame you not to goe of deuotion to that church of our lady: but for the indulgence I tell you your iorney is in vaine. And if you beleeue me, you ſhall ſaue much of the way: for there are here in this church far more indulgences then in that whither you goe, which if you be well aduiſed you may gaine, and ſo retourne againe. In confirmation of his ſpeech, he ſhewed them many priuiledges and bulles of Popes, of lardge indulgences graunted to that church. The Pilgrimes vpon theſe conſiderations beleeuing the Sacriſtine, and repenting the weariſome trauaile they had vndertaken to come ſo farre, followed his counſaile, and hauing offered their deuotions in that place, and gayned the indulgences there to be had, determined to retourne. Amongſt them was a verie deuout woman, that ſaid vnto them I meruayle, my freindes, you are not aſhamed vpon the opinion and diſcourſe of one only man, to looſe the meritt of your pilgrimage? Retourne you in Goddes name, if you thincke good, for my part I am determined to goe alone to viſitt our lady of Angels, though there were no indulgence in that church, and ſo to accompliſh my iorney ſo much aduanced: ſo went ſhe alone towardes Aſsiſium. But by the will of God, that ſhe might not trauaile alone, ſhe erred from the direct way, being therefor much troubled and ſollicitous how to finde the ordinary way, there appeared vnto her a right venerable old man all gray, cloathed in a long habitt Religious-like, who ſaid vnto her: Feare not my daughter, for I aſſure thee thou art in a ſecure way for thy ſoule, and know that thy companions ſhall inſtantlie ioyne vnto thee. She looking behinde her, ſaw them all, wherat ſhe was exceeding ioyfull: being then together, this venerable old man told them, that they had done well to proſecute their attempted iorney, becauſe the ſaid indulgence was true, and that himſelfe was preſent when the Pope Honorious confirmed it: and that he knew it alſo to be confirmed of God: though there were many that knew not all that, and that denyed it, and therfore bid them goe on confidentlie. And after he had made them a worthie exhortation, to perſuade them to offend God ſo much no more, he vaniſhed in their preſence, leauing them exceedinglie comforted and thanckfull vnto God▪ Coming to Aſsiſium they manifeſted

this accident, and hauing gayned the indulgence, they ioyfullie tooke their iorney of retourne. The aforeſaid woman by reaſon of a ſicknes that happened her vnto, remayned alone behinde: but dying afterward, ſhe ouertooke them in ſpiritt, and appeared vnto them on the ſea, and ſaid vnto them: Feare yee not, for I am ſuch a one your companion, that am dead att Aſsiſium. The Virgin Marie hath ſent me to aſſure you of the vertue of the plenary indulgence; wherebie I paſſed incontinentlie to heauen, without enduring the leaſt puniſhment, which ſaid, ſhe diſappeared. Wherfore many of thoſe Pilgrimes that ſaw this woman on the ſea, retourned often times with greater faith to gaine the indulgence, and recounted the apparitions: ſo that though no bulles were ſeene, Sainct Francis not reſpecting them, many of diuers nations, repayred thither, when neither warre nor plague did hinder them: for God who graunted it and promiſed to fauour it alſo with his grace, beſides the reuelation therof vnto many, did alſo inſpire ſoules to ſeeke the pourchace of their ſaluation in that holie church.
                  An old man, comming to gaine this indulgence recounted what he had heard ſpoaken by a Pilgrime that firſt doubted therof: to witt, that being in a ſolitarie place, where he recommended himſelfe to God, he ſeemed miraculouslie to ſee the Pope, the Cardinals, and S. Francis, conferring together; and that according to the geſtures and motions they vſed, it ſeemed that the Pope would giue the bulle of this indulgence to S. Francis, who refuſed it, and one of the Cardinals ſtanding vp, tooke a booke in his hand, wherin he read theſe wordes: A plenarie indulgence of all ſinnes att S. Marie of Angels, graunted in earth and confirmed in heauen, and tourning leafe by leafe, he ſtill read the ſame thing, and hauing tourned it all ouer, and ſo read the ſaid booke, the viſion diſappeared, and the pilgrime to his great contentment reſted fullie ſatisfied, of the meritt and vertue of the ſaid indulgence.
                  The Biſhop of Aſsiſium named Illuminato, diuers times made relatiō of a gentleman a very deuout pilgrime, to whō (being by ſome diſſuaded from goeing to gaine the ſaid indulgence) there appeared, as he was in prayer, a Religious man, in habitt of a Deacon, cloathed in white, and exceedinglie glittering, who thrice ſaid vnto him: The indulgence is true, come ſec
                           •
                        rely. Being ſo aſſured by the true Deacon of IESVS CHRISTS. Francis, with great confidence repayred thither, in all his iorney diuulging this indulgence, wherof he ſo much doubted before being related by other: he recounted this his viſion to the ſaid Biſhop of Aſsiſium.
                  Certaine Pilgrimes comming from the marquiſate of Ancona to

gaine the ſaid indulgence, they mett ſome yong men, who vnderſtanding by them whither they went, one of them deridingly ſaid; that indulgence whither you goe is as true, as that I hold in my hand that ſwallow that flyeth in the aire: which hauing ſaid, he inſtantlie ſaw the ſwallow in his hand, att which miracle both the pilgrimes and thoſe preſent, were all amazed: the ſaid yong man acknowledged hisfault, and accuſed himſelfe, the Pilgrimes confirmed in faith, proceeded on their iorney, euery where recounting what had befallen them to the praiſe of God, ſo highly zealous of the ſaluation of miſerable ſoules.
                  Gerard de Fighnio being very paſsionately amourous of an honeſt woman, to whom he could in no ſort gett to ſpeake, by reaſon that ſhe was almoſt alwayes retired in her houſe, and accompanyed when ſhe went abroad, he attended an occaſion (the deuill hauing alreadie led him into error) when, according to her cuſtome, ſhe ſhould of deuotion goe to our Lady of Angels, hoping either in the way, or in the church, ſome opportunity would be offered of ſpeaking vnto her: the time being come, he ioyned himſelfe in company with many deuout perſonnes, that went with the ſaid woman to gaine the indulgence; but the men being a litle ſeparated from the women, his firſt hope was vaine, and his ſecond more: for it miraculously happened that he could neuer ſee her in the church, though he well ſaw all her company. Wherfore acknowledging his fault, and repenting it, he confeſſed himſelfe, gayned the indulgence, chaunged his life and behauiour, yea ſo far foorth, that he ſhortly after became Religious, where he liued and dyed vertuously.
               
               
                  What ſanctity Sainct Francis would haue obſerued in that church.
                  THE VI. CHAPTER.
                  AS well in reſpecte of the accidentes afore recited, as diuers other which God wrought in this holie church, the holy Father Sainct Francis avouched as being reuealed vnto him, that it was loued of the Virgin Mary with a particuler deuotion aboue all other churches of the world. Therin were alſo graunted verie great graces to the ſaid holy Father, and prerogatiues generallie and particulerlie, for himſelfe and for others: and therfore, that the Religious might neuer forgett with what deuotion and reuerence they ought to reſpect that church,

and that particuler memory might be had therof aboue all the memorable thinges of the Order: being one day ſicke in preſence of his Vicar Generall, and many other Religious, in manner of a teſtament he left theſe wordes: I will that this houſe and church of our Lady of Angels of Portiuncula, be duely reuerenced and honoured of my Religious, and that therein be the reſidence of the Generall of the Order; that he may prouide vnto this houſe a pious family, with greater deuotion and dilligence, to the end it may ſerue for example and mirour in piety and good conuerſation; and eſpecially that there be choſen very ſpirituall Preiſtes and Clarckes, to miniſter with deuotion, that the Religious and ſeculers comming hither to gaine this holy indulgence be well edified therby: and likewiſe I will that the lay Brethten be choſen humble and of vertuous life, and that they ſerue the Preiſtes, with much reſpect and reuerence. I will beſides that in this place be obſerued a perpetuall ſilence, and that if there be neceſsity of ſpeaking, they ſpeake only with their ſuperiours and among them, be very wary not to recount worldlie matters, or other idle wordes, yea that themſelues giue no eare in ſuch thinges to ſeculer perſonnes, to the end that no worldly matter enter into this holie houſe, and that the Religious may the better conſerue their holy pouertie therin. And with all that this habitation be not prophaned by earthly diſcourſes: but that therein the time be alwayes employed in himnes, prayers, and pſalmes, the moſt ſecure armour for guard of the hart. And if any religious herein already placed, become and libertine a obſerue not this Order and courſe of life, I will that the Guardian expell him, and put an other, ſuch as he ſhall thinck ſitt, in his place. To the end that if other Religious and monaſteries eſtabliſhed, whereſoeuer els where doe erre from the puritie due to their eſtate and to their vocation, and vow made to God, this holy place att leaſt, bleſſed by our Lord, may remaine and perſeuer as a mirour and example of true Religion, and euangelicall perfection, and may be a candleleſticke before the throne of God, and the glorious Virgin Mary, euer burning and giuing light, for whoſe ſake God may pardon the faultes and offences of all the Brethren of the Order, and that this plante of our Religion may be for euer conſerued, producing fruites worthy of merittes, and ſo obtayning the moſt holie grace of God.
                  Such was the Order of the glorious Father S. Francis, which was ſeriously obſerued of his firſt Religious, nouriſhed and educated with the pureſt milke of ſanctitie, who knowing how much this place was loued of IESVS CHRIST and his ſacred mother,

liued alwayes in this houſe, in higheſt purity, in perpetuall ſilence, and in extreme pouerty. When they chaunced to ſpeake ſome litle out of the time of ſilence, their diſcourſes were of ſpirituall thinges,The ſanctitie of the first Frier Minors of Aſsiſe. of benefittes receaued of God, of our ingratitude, of his mercie, and all with exceeding great humility and deuotion. And if by miſgard it happened, which it very ſeldome or neuer did, that ſome one of them began to ſpeake ſome thing that was not of God or more neceſſary, he was incontinently reprehend by the others, and did penance for it att the ſame inſtant. In this place they mortified their fleſh, not only by watching and faſtinges: but alſo by diſciplines, nakednes, and the rigour and auſterity of their habitt, ſupporting the one in ſommer, and the other in winter, and the lay Brethren by labouring in the feeld to gaine bread, and to maintaine themſelues, and the other Religious by ſuch and other vertuous exerciſes, ſanctifying themſelues, and the place where they dwell. A very deuout Religious being yet in the world, ſaw once in viſion a great nomber of people, kneeling before this churche, with ioyned handes and eyes eleuated towardes heauen, all blinde, who with loud voice required mercy of God, powring out abondance of teares, and beſeeching the diuine Maieſtie, to voutſafe to reſtore their ſight: which prayer, ended, he ſaw deſcēd from heauen an exceeding great light, that illuminating all the place, reſtored ſight to the blind, vpon which viſion he afterward became Religious.
               
               
                  How ſainct Francis inſtituted the ſecond rule, and of the Apoſtolicall Bulle of pope Honorius, against the profeſsed that leaue the Order.
                  THE VII. CHAPTER.
                  THe Religion of the Frere Minors daily augmenting and manie entring therinto without well meaſuring their forces before, by their weaknes of ſpiritt, their firſt feruours incontinently decayed, wherfore being vnable to continue firme vnder the hammer of Euangelicall life, leauing the habitt, they went out of the Order, worſe, by reaſon of their apoſtaſie committed, then they entred in. Others without leauing the habitt, went wandring ouer the world, others, the rigour being not then ſo ſeuere, liued att libetty; affirming that they were not bound to obſerue a rule that was not confirmed, nor approued by the holy Apoſtoſtolike ſea, but only viua vocis

The yeare of grace 1221. which was the fiſt of his Papacie, his holines, for the reaſons aforeſaid made his breuet following, two yeares before the ſecond rule was confirmed.

Becauſe according to the opinion of the wiſe, one ought to doe nothing without counſaile, that being done no repentance enſue▪ It is therefore neceſſary to him that will orderly and duely diſpoſe a ſpirituall life and one more excellent then ordinary, that he ſett his eyes before his feet: that is, that he precedently make good triall of his proper forces, with the rule of diſcretion, that he happen not (which God for bidd) to looke backe and be conuerted into a piller of loſt ſalt, for not hauing ſeaſoned his ſacrifice with the ſalt of prudence, remayning as he that is vn wiſe without ſauour and ſalt, if he be not ſeruent: and ſo he that is ſeruent, ſhalbe fooliſh and vnſauoury, if he be not wiſe: therfore it is moſt prudently ordayned in all Religious, that they who are to promiſe reguler obſeruance, doe formerly make good triall therof, for a certaine time, to auoyed occaſion of repentance: for ſo he cannot lay any excuſe on his temeritie or ignorance. For this cauſe, we by the tenour of theſe preſentes, forbid you to admitt any perſonne to the profeſsion of your Order, if he haue not firſt made an entier yeare of probation, and alſo we ordaine that after the the ſaid profeſsion none preſume, to forſake the Order, and that no other receaue him, hauing left the ſame. We alſo make prohibition, that none goe out of his obedience, with the habitt of the Order, nor doe corrupt the puritie of true pouertie. And if any preſume to doe it, we authoriſe you his ſuperiours to execute againſt ſuch, the eccleſiaſticall cenſures, till he retourne to obedience. Lett none whoſoeuer attempt to infringe theſe preſent letters of prohition and benefitt, or to oppoſe againſt them: for if any one preſume ſo to doe, lett him be aſſured to incurre the indignation of God, and of his bleſſed Apoſtles S, Peter and S. Paul. Giuen att Viterbium, the 22. of September the fift yeare of our Papacie.

                     Beſides all this, it was thought neceſſary, Ad perpetuam rei memoriam, for a perpetuall memorie therof, and for the aſſeurance and ſtabilitie of the order, to confirme the ſaid rule by Apoſtolicall authoritie. Therfore the Cardinall Vgolino, Protectour of the Order, prayed the holie Father S. Francis to abridge it, for it had bin much augmented by reaſon of manie new accidentes that happened from hand to hand. He prayed him, I ſay, to moderate it in certaine thinges, that it might be more eaſy, to execute and to learne by hart, and that he would procure it to be for euer confirmed by an Apoſtolicall bulle. S. Francis vnderſtanding this, would know if ſuch were the will of God, as in all matters of importance that he enterpriſed, he accuſtomed to doe: and therfore taking leaue of the Cardinall, telling him that he would ſhortlie giue him anſweare, he had recourſe to prayer, where he made ſupplication to God, that he would reueale vnto him what he ſhould doe, who was rauiſhed in ſpiritt, and had this viſion: It ſeemed vnto him that he heaped together a quantitie of crummes of bread, which he was to ſhare amongſt many Religious, who together with himſelfe were as it were hunger-ſtaruen, and becauſe the crummes were too ſmall, he was carefull how to deuide them that they might not fall through his fingers: but he heard a voice that ſaid; Francis make one entier hoſte of thoſe crummes, and then giue it to them that will eat it. Which hauing done, it ſeemed vnto him that all they who receaued it not with deuotion, or miſpriſed it, were entierlie couered with leproſie, which viſion, he not ſo plainelie vnderſtanding as he deſired, praying againe the day following, and perſeuering in demaunding counſaile of God, he heard the ſame voice that ſaid: Francis the crummes of bread of the laſt night, are the Euangelicall counlailes, the hoſte the Rule, and the leaproſie malice, The holy Father then knew, that he ſhould vnite his rule, and compoſe it of the Euangelicall counſailes, compendious and myſticall.
                     Hauing therfore giuen anſweare to the ſaid Cardinall, that he would confine his rule, conformably to the will of the diuine Maieſty, and taking with him Brother Leo, and Brother Boniſius of Bolognia, he wēt vp to the mount Carnerio, neere Rieta, otherwiſe called Fonte-Colō
                        bo, where faſting with bread and water forty dayes and forty nightes, and perſiſting in continuall prayer, he wrote and compoſed his rule, as God reuealed vnto him, then came downe with it from the mountaine, as an other Moyſes, with the tables of the law, and committed it to the keeping of Brother Helias, who was his Vicar Generall, who

perceauing it to conſiſt of a greater contempt of the world, and of a more ſtrict pouerty of life, then was gratefull vnto him, ſo delt that the rule was loſt and periſhed, that it might not be approued and confirmed by the Pope, with intention to make an other according to his fanſie. But the holy Father that would rather follow the diuine then humane will, making no eſteeme of the wiſe of the world, and knowing in ſpiritt the fayned cogitations of that Religious, reſolued to retourne to the ſaid mountaine, by faſting and prayer more copiously to obtaine the will and rule of God, for his ſeruantes the Frere Minors.
                     Now Brother Helias to interrupt this his ſecond attempt, called an aſſemblie of many learned ſuperiours of the Order, where 
                           •
                        e began to diſcouer his peruerſe intention, alleadging vnto them that Brother Francis intended to conſtitute a rule ſo ſtrict and auſtere, that was impoſsible to be obſerued, and that he would procure it to be confirmed by the Pope for euer. Which they hauing heard, they with one accord anſweared: that they yelded all authoritie vnto him: and that ſith he was his Vicar Generall, he ſhould go to him, and tell him that they intended not to keepe the rule he made, but that it ſhould be for himſelfe alone if he would. But Brother Helias fearing to be reprehended of S. Francis, incouraged them, and perſwaded them to goe with him: and ſo they wentin companie to the ſaid mountaine, and being called by Brother Helias, he knew his voice, and came out of his celle, and ſeeing ſo many Religious, he asked Brother Helias what they would, who anſweared: they are ſuperiours of the Order, who vnderſtanding that you inſtitute a new rule, they and I fearing we ſhall not be able obſerue it, doe proteſt vnto you, that we will not oblige our ſelues therevnto. S. Francis made no other anſweare to this proteſtation, but falling on his knees, and caſting his eyes to heauen, ſaid; My God, did I not tell thee, that theſe people would not beleeue me? and att the inſtant a voice was heard that ſayd. Francis, as in this rule there is nothing of thine, but all commeth, and is of me, ſo alſo I will that it be obſerued. Ad literam, ad literam, ad literam, without gloſſe, without gloſſe, without gloſſe, I know the infirmitie of man, I know alſo my will to aſsiſt him. Therfore, they that will not obſerue it, lett them depart the Order, and permitt others to keep it: S. Francis then tourning to the ſuperiours, ſaid: haue ye heard, haue ye heard, haue ye heard? would ye know more? hereatt they were ſo confounded, that trembling as beſides themſelues, they departed acknowledgeing their errour and not replying one word, the holy father then retourned to accompliſh the rule, entierlie conformable to that which God had precedentlie reuealed

vnto him. This was in the yeare 1223. fifteene yeares after the Order confirmed by Pope Innocentius.
                     The S. did afterward carry this rule to Roome, and deliuered it to Cardinal Vgolino his Protectour, who preſented it to Pope Honorius, together with the holy Father, who reading it vnto him, and the Pope conſidering the ſeuerity and rigour therof, ſayd: that it ſeemed to him very difficult to be obſerued▪ The S. anſweared: I beſeech your Holineſſe to beleeue, that there is not in it, ſo much as one word of myne inuention, but that our Lord IESVS CHRIST, hath compoſed it, who well knoweth what is neceſſary and behoufull to the ſaluation of ſoules, to the profitt of Religious, and to the conſeruation of this Order. Therefore I neither can, nor ought, to alter any point therof. The Pope then, inſpired of God, and for the zeale he had to Euangelicall perfection, which by this rule, S. Francis planted in the church, ſaid to himſelfe: Bleſſed is he that, being inſpired by diuine grace, ſhall with fidelitie and deuotion obſerue this rule: ſith what is contayned in it is Catholicke, holy, and perfect: and ſo in perpetuall memory, by the inſuyng Apoſtolicall Breuy, he confirmed the ſame.
                  
               
               
                  The bulle of confirmation of the rule of the Frere Minors, by Pope Honorius the thirde.
                  THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                  HOnorius Biſhop and ſeruant of the ſeruantes of God, to hie beloued children, Brother Francis, and all other Frere Minors: health and Apoſtolicall benediction: Becauſe the Apoſtolick ſea hath alwayes accuſtomed to fauour the iuſt deſires and vowes of them that require it. We therfore condiſcend to your pious petitions (children beloued in our Lord IESVS CHRIST) which are, that we confirme the rule already approued by Innocentius the third our Predeceſſour, as is cited in the preſent letters. We now by the Apoſtolicall auctoritie which we haue, doe confirme the ſame, and doe corroborate it vnto you by vertue of this preſent Breuy. The rule is ſuch as followeth.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                              THE SECONDE RVLE OF THE FRIER MINORS, approued and confirmed by Apoſtolicall Breuy of Pope Honorious the ſecond.
                              
                                 In the name of God here followeth the rule and life of the Frere Minors.
                                 THE FIRST CHAPTER.
                                 THe rule and life of the Frere Minors is thus; to obſerue the holy goſpell of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, liuing vnder obedience, without poſſeſsing any thing of proper, and in chaſtirie. Brother Francis promiſeth to Pope Honorius and his ſucceſſors canonically elected, and to the Romane Church, obedience and reuerence: and the Religious are obliged to obey Brother Francis, and his ſucceſſours.
                              
                              
                                 How they who deſire to lead this life, are to be admitted.
                                 THE II. CHAPTER.
                                 IF any one inſpired of God, will enter into this Religion and eſpouſe this kind of life, when he ſhall haue imparted his intention to ſome Religious, lett him be ſent to the Prouinciall Miniſter, who and no other, is permitted to receaue the Religious. The Miniſter being informed of his deſire, ought dilligentlie to examine him touching the Catholick faith, and the ſacramentes of holy church, if he be obedient and giue ſatisfaction herein, he ſhall proceed further and aske him, if he be not marryed, or being ſo, if his wife be entred or intend to enter into ſome Monaſteries of Religious women, by permiſsion of their Biſhop, hauing firſt both together made vow of chaſtitie, they muſt alſo be of age, that no ſiniſter opinion be conceaued of them. The truth of all this being vnderſtood, and no other impediment conſiſting, lett him be inſtantlie aduertiſed of the goſpell that ſaith: Goe ſell all thou haſtMatt. 19. and giue to the poore: and if for ſome lawfull impediment, he cannot doe it; his goodwill ſhall ſuffice. Lett the Brethren and their Miniſters be very wary, not to reſpect his temporall affaires, but lett them leaue it freelie vnto him to diſpoſe it as he ſhall finde himſelfe

inſpired of our lord: and if the ſaid Nouice demaund Counſaile cō
                                    cerning this point, of his ſuperiour, he may ſend him to ſome man fearing God, by whoſe counſaile he may diſtribute his ſubſtance to the poore or otherwiſe art his pleaſure. And all this done the habitt of probation may be giuen him, which conſiſteth of two coates without capuce, and a cord for a gridle, and the linnen breeches with the Caperon reaching euen to the girdle, vnles it ſometimes ſeeme to the ſaid Miniſters otherwiſe conuenient. The yeare of probation expired, the Nouices ſhalbe receaued to obedience, making vow to obſerue this rule euer during their life. It ſhalbe in no ſort permiſſable vnto them after the ſaid probation, vnder whatſoeuer pretence to goe out of Religion conformably to the commandement of his holines: for as the goſpell ſaith: No man putting his hand to the plough, and looking back,Luc. 9. is apt for the kingdome of God. Lett there be giuen to them that ſhall haue already promiſed obedience, a coate with the capuce, an other without it: thoſe that will and are conſtrayned by neceſsitie
                                       •
                                    , may weare ſockes. All the Religious ſhalbe cloathed with courſe cloth, which they may peece with ſacking &amp; other patches with the bleſsing of God. I admoniſh and exhort them, not to miſpriſe nor iudge raſhly of the mē whome they ſhall ſee cloathed deliciously and in diuers colours, and doe liue and feed themſelues with delicate meates; but lett each one iudge and miſpriſe himſelfe.
                              
                              
                                 Of the courſe and order to be obſerued in ſaying diuine ſeruice, and its fasting, and how the brethren ought to trauell ouer the world.
                                 THE III. CHAPTER.
                                 THe clarckes ſhall ſay the diuine office, according to the Order of the holy Romane church, except the pſalter, when they may haue breuiaries. The lay Brothers for their matines, ſhall ſay twenty foure Pater noſters, for laudes, fiue; for prime, third, ſixt, and ninth houre, for each, ſeauen; for euenſong, twelue, and for compline, ſeauen; and they ſhall pray for the dead, All the Brethren ſhall faſt from the feaſt of Alſainctes, to the Natiuity of our lord: as alſo the lent of forty dayes that beginneth after the Epiphany (it was conſecrated by our lord IESVS CHRIST, with his holy faſt) they who ſhall faſt it of their proper will ſhalbe bleſſed of God, and they that will not faſt it ſhall not ſinne, nor are obliged vnto it: but all ought to faſt the lent before the Paſche of the reſurrection of our lord. This rule doth not binde to faſt any other time but the friday: but in caſe of neceſsity, the Religious ſhall not be obliged to corporall faſt. Now I counſaile;

admoniſh, and exhort my Religious in the name of our lord, that when they ſhall goe ouer the world, they vſe no diſputes nor cōtentious wordes, nor iudgeil of any perſonne; but that they be curteous, mild, humble and modeſt, ſpeaking religiously to euery one, as is requiſite. And they ought not to trauell on horſeback, if they be not conſtrayned by manifeſt neceſsity or infirmity. Entring into houſes, lett them ſay: PeaceMatt. 10. be in this houſe. And according to the goſpell, of all meates that ſhall be preſented vnto them, it ſhalbe lawfull for them to eat.
                              
                              
                                 That the Brethren ought not to receaue mony.
                                 THE IV. CHAPTER.
                                 IAbſolutelie commaunde all the Brethren, not to receaue any kind of mony, be it by them ſelues or any third perſon; yet for neceſsity of the ſicke and to cloath the other Brethren, it is ordayned that the Miniſters and Guardians, ſhall haue care and cogitation therof only by ſpirituall freindes, according to the places and times, and as of neceſsity they ſhall ſee expedient: neuertheles perſiſting alwayes reſolute as is ſaid, not to receaue any kind of mony.
                              
                              
                                 Of the manner of labouring.
                                 THE V. CHAPTER.
                                 THe Brethen that haue the grace of God to labour, lett them performe it faithfully with deuotion, and in ſuch ſort, that ſhunning idlenes, the capitall ennemy of ſoules, they extinguiſh not the ſpititt of holy prayer and deuotion, which ought to be preferred before all other temporall exerciſes. And as for the hire of their labour, they may receaue for themſelues and their brethren whatſoeuer ſhalbe neceſſarie to the body, except mony, and this with humility, as is conuenient to the true ſeruantes of God, and to the followers of holy pouerty.
                              
                              
                                 That the brethren may haue nothing proper, and of the manner of aſking almoſe, and miniſtring to the ſicke.
                                 THE VI. CHAPTER.
                                 THe brethten may haue nothing proper, as houſes, landes, farmes, nor other thing whatſoeuer: but lett them liue as Pilgrimes and

ſtrangers in this world, ſeruing our lord in humility and pouerty, lett them goe confidently to demaund almoſe. And they muſt not be aſhamed, being mindefull that our lord became poore for vs in this world. My moſt deere brethren, for this moſt high vertue of pouerty it is that you are inſtitued inheritours of the celeſtiall kingdome, by our Redeemer IESEVS CHRIST, who making you poore in temporall ſubſtance hath enriched you with vertue, that with this portion of riches he may exalt you to the land of the liuing. I therfore pray you in the name of IESVS CHRIST, to poſſeſſe nothing in this world. In whatſoeuer place you are, be alwayes familier amōg yourſelues, manifeſting only to each other your neceſſities. For if the mother nouriſhe and loue her carnall child, with! how▪ much more diligence, ought each of you to loue and cheriſh his ſpirituall brother? And if any of the Brethrē fall ſick, the other brethren ought to ſerue and comfort him, as themſelues in neceſsitie would be ſerued.
                              
                              
                                 Of the pennance to be giuen to the Brethren that shall ſinne.
                                 THE VII. CHAPTER.
                                 IF any of the Brethren induced by the deuil offend mortallie in thoſe kind of ſinnes which are reſerued to the Prouinciall Miniſter, lett him be obliged incōtinently without delay to goe to his Prouincial Miniſter, who being Preiſt, ſhall enioyne him penāce with mercy. And if he be not Preiſt, he ſhall procure him to be enioyned by an other Preiſt of the Order, as God ſhail inſpire him, and as to him ſhall ſeeme moſt expedient; lett them be carefull not to be moued to anger or vexed att the ſinne of an other: for choller &amp; anger hinder charity in himſelfe and others.
                              
                              
                                 The manner of holding the Generall chapter att Penticoſt, and of electing a Generall when there shalbe occaſion.
                                 THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                                 AL the brethren of this Order, ought alwayes to haue a Miniſter Generall &amp; ſeruant of al the Brethren, whome they ſhalbe obliged ſincerilie to obay. And he dying, his ſucceſſour ſhalbe elected by the Prouincialls and Guardians att the Chapter held at the feaſt of Penticoſt. Att which time the Prouincialls are alwayes bound to aſſembly euerie three yeares, more or Jeſſe, in ſuch place and according as ſhall pleaſe the ſaid Generall. And if it ſeeme to all the Prouinciall Miniſters and Guardians, that their Miniſter Generall is not ſufficient for the ſeruice and common vtilitie of the Brethren, in ſuch caſe all the

Brethren that haue aucthoririe to elect a Generall are bound to conſtitute, in the name of our lord, an other in his place. The generall chapter of Penticoſt being ended, lett the Miniſters and Guardians of euerie Prouince haue power if they pleaſe, to keep the ſame yeare a chapter in their iuriſdictions, aſſembling thither the Brethren that ſhalbe vnder their chardge and iuriſdiction.

                                 THE IX. CHAPTER.
                                 LEtt not the Brethren that are admitted to preach, intrude themſelues to preach in any biſh oppericke, without permiſsion of the Biſhoppe: and lett no Brother preſume to preach to the people, whome the Miniſter Generall hath not formerly examined approued, and admitted to the office of preaching. I alſo exhort and admoniſh the Brethren to haue great conſideration in their preachinges, what wordes they vtter, to the end they be ſo pure and chaſte that the people may be edified therby. Lett thē reprehend vices, prayſe vertues, diſcouering the puniſhmēt of the one &amp; glory of the other, and lett their ſermonsEſa. 10. Rom. 9. be cōpendious of wordes: for our lord hath made an abbreuiated word on earth.

                                 THE X. CHAPTER,
                                 LEtt the Miniſters, as ſeruantes of others, be carefull to viſitt and admoniſh the Brethren that are vnder their gouernment: and as need ſhall require, lett them correct ſuch as ſhall deſerue it, but lett it be done with humility and charity; Being very carefull not to cō
                                    mand them any thing againſt our rule and the benefitt of their ſoules; &amp; lett the Brethren that ought to obey, remember that for the loue of God they haue renounced their proper will. I therefore very ſtrictly cōmand them to obey their Miniſters in whatſoeuer they haue promiſed God to obſerue, and to obey in their profeſsion, prouided that it be not in preiudice of their ſoules and of our rule. In whatſoeuer place the Brethren be, where they know they cannot ſpiritually obſerue the rule, they may and ought to haue recourſe to their Miniſters; who muſt receaue them with benignitie and charitie, and giue them confidence and courage to diſcouer their neceſsities, and that with ſuch familiaritie, as if the ſubiectes were the maſters. For ſo is it requiſite the Miniſters be ſeruantes to all Brethren. I admoniſh all the Brethren in the

name of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, to be very wary of the great and enormous ſinnes of pride, vaine glory, enuy, auarice, and of cogitations and cares of the world, of murmuring and detracting their neighbour. Thoſe who haue not ſtudyed, lett them not regard to beginne the ſame: but lett them eſpecially ſtudy to haue the ſpirit of God and his holy workes, to make continuall prayer with a pure hart, and to be patient and humble in ſickneſſes and perſecutions towardes them that perſecute, reprehend and contradict vs: for our Lord ſaith: loue your ennemyes and pray for them that perſecute and calumniate you.Matt. 6. 10. &amp;

                                 THE XI. CHAPTER.
                                 I Ōrdaine and command all my Brethren, that they haue no ſuſpected familiarities with women: and that they enter not into the Couentes of Religious women, thoſe excepted who to that effect ſhall haue ſpeciall licence from the Apoſtolicall ſea. Likewiſe I will not, that my Religious be God fathers either of men or women, that by ſuch meanes there happen not any ſcandall among the Brethren, or by their occaſion.

                                 EVery Brother whoſoeuer, that by diuine inſpiration deſireth to goe among the Sarrazins and other Infidels, lett him demaund leaue of his Prouinciall Miniſter; who ſhalbe very reſpectiue not to giue licence, but to ſuch as to him ſhall ſeeme fitt to doe good among ſuch people. And for all theſe cauſes, I commaund the Miniſters vpon obedience to procure of his Holines to haue a Cardinall for Gouernour, Protectour and Correctour of this Confraternity, that they may be alwayes ſubiect to the feet of the holy Romane Church, ſtable and firme in the Catholike faith. Lett pouerty, humility, and the holy goſpell of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, be entierlie obſerued of vs, as we haue faithfully promiſed.

                  Of the perfection of this rule and the abridgement therof.
                  THE IX. CHAPTER.
                  AS the three yong men (according to Daniel) were ioyfull in the flaming fire of the burning fournace, where Nabuchodonoſor had cauſed them to be throwne, as faithfull ſeruantes of God, becauſe they would not giue to his monſtruous ſtatua, the honour dew to God alone, and as they ſung prayſes to the Almightie, together with a fourth like vnto the ſonne of God: ſo there were three Orders and holy Rules founded by three holy perſonnages, S. Baſill, S. Auguſtin, and S. Benedict, in the burning fournace of temptations and worldly afflictions, wherwith the prince of the world, combatteth againſt the ſeruantes of God and often times ſurmounteth them, which holy perſonnes as men freed from the fire and from feare, haue with alacritie prayſed God, in the middes of it; Afterward there was ſeene the fourth, like vnto the ſonne of God, to witt. The Seraphicall and crucified ſeruant of IESVS CHRISTS. Francis, that gaue a fourth eſtate vnto the church, wherin men, being deliuered from the priſon of the world and taking more content in the honours and graces of God, might more freelie ſerue IESVS CHRIST. And ſuch was his intention in all the wordes of his Euangelicall rule, to witt, that they who had made profeſsion to imitate IESVS CHRIST, ſhould endeauour to become the moſt like vnto him in laboures of their life and exerciſes of ſpiritt, that poſsibly could be procured. He with the help of the holy Ghoſt, founded on that onlie and firme foundation of IESVS CHRIST, the edifice of the rule in meruaylous hight and perfection. Therefore in the firſt chapter

                     The ſubſtance of the rule. he ſaith: The life and rule of the Frere Minors is ſuch: to keep and obſerue the holie goſpell, liuing vnder holie obedience, without poſſeſsing any thing in proprietie, and in pure chaſtitie. The life, ſpiritt and wordes of the ſaid holy Father conſidered, his intention was, that the Frere Minors ſhould obſerue not onlie the preceptes of the goſpell, but the counſailes alſo. Neuertheles knowing and conſidering humane infirmitie, he would not oblige them to all. In the ſecond chapter, heIohn. 14. teacheth to forſake and contemne the world, with whatſoeuer is in it, giuing them meanes to make ſuch renunciation as the goſpell teacheth, which is, to ſell what they haue and to giue it to the poore, that being deliuered of ſo great an impediment they might freelie ſerue IESVS CHRIST, and with him ſay. The Prince of this world is come, &amp; in me he hath found nothing. In the third he teacheth exerciſes to prayſe God by the diuine offices, and by faſtinges and ſeuere abſtinences, mortifications of the fleſh, good examples and edification of our neighbour, and particulerlie of ſeculer perſonnes. He alſo teacheth them the vertue of penance, humilitie and charity, whereby they may with edification conuerſe with all people. In the fourth, he expresly declareth, that he will not, his brethren ſhall haue mony vnder any pretence whatſoeuer: but that the Prouincialls ſhall ſupplie their neceſsities, knowing that auarice is daungerous to ſoules, and principallie to Religious: and how true is the ſentence of IESVS CHRIST where heMatt. 6. ſaith, that no man can ſerue God and Mammon. The holy Father therfore would that richeſſe ſhould not onlie be remote, but entierlie and abſolutelie ſeparated from the Order. In the fift, he banniſheth from his ſocietie, idlenes, as contrarie to the true ſeruantes of God, and capitall ennemy of mennes ſaluation. In the ſixt, he rayſeth the ſoule frō cogitations of the world, and in as much as may be hoped or expected of him, leauing neither place nor affection proper in thē, wherby they might adhere to any cogitation of terreſtriall loue, to the end that they mightPhilip. 3. ioyfullie ſay: Our conuerſation is in heauen, as poſſeſsing nothing on earth.

In the eighty chapter, he teacheth the Superiours and all his Order, in what manner they ought to gouerne▪ the Religious and inſinuateth that they ſhould procure to haue alwayes a Generall ſufficient and worthy of ſuch a chardge. In the ninth, he teacheth his preachers, to fly pride, and arrogance in their life and doctrine, and to be humble and zealous of the ſaluation of ſoules, feeding them alwayes with holie and profitable doctrine, without which they can neuer produce fruit redounding

to the benefitt of the ſaid ſoules. In the tenth, he admoniſheth ſuperiours and ſubiectes to be verie carefull in the diligent accompliſhment of their obedience, and the obligation which is reciprocallie betwen them, but particulerlie that which they owe and is due to God, by reaſon of their profeſsion. In the eleuenth chapter, he demonſtrateth vnto his Religious, how they ought to ſhunne occaſions of ſinne and ſcandales, eſpecially women. In the twelueth and laſt, he teacheth them how they ſhould expoſe their life for the loue of IESVS CHRIST and for his law, among Infidelles: Then he concludeth according to the beginning, ſhewing that all conſiſteth in the faith and obedience of the Romane church, and in the obſeruance of the holie goſpell of our lord IESVS CHRIST, who is our Alpha &amp; Omega, that is, our beginning and our end. The holie Father S. Francis founded his life and rule, on theſe twelue Apoſtolicall chapters; as on twelue ſtones taken out of the depth of Iourdain, that is out of the hight of EuangelicallIoſue 4. perfection. This rule ſhall continue and be of force for euer as a teſtimonie vnto the profeſſours thereof, that God hath alreadie cō

                  Of th zeeale which the holy Father S. Francis had vnto Religion and to the obſeruance of the goſpell.
                  THE X. CHAPTER.
                  THe perfect imitatour of IESVS CHRIST, did ſo affect the obſeruance of the holy goſpell, &amp; was ſo exceeding zealous of the rule, that with a ſinguler benediction he enriched thoſe that were ſingulerlie zealous in the obſeruation therof. Whervpon he ſaid to his Brethren: our rule is a book of life to them that follow it, a hope of ſaluation, an earneſt of glorie, the iuyce of the goſpell, an aſſured way of the croſſe, an eſtate of perfection, a key of Paradice, and an accord of eternall beatitude. He would that all his Brethren ſhould haue it with them, and often times read it, and in their ſpiritual conferences and conuerſations ſhould for edification ordinarilie diſcourſe therof: that often conferring therof together, they might neuer forgett this diuine pact and ſpirituall vow, and that they might ſo poſſeſſe it in their handes, their boſome and before their eyes, that death aſſaulting them, they might dye with it in their armes.
                  
                     
A Religious, dying among the Mores, as he deſired, made his benefitt of this holy doctrine of his holy Father: for being taken by the Mores preaching the faith, and hauing endured many tormentes, and they intending to cutt of his head, he tooke his rule into his handes and falling on his knees, with great feruour and humility he ſaid to his companion: my beloued Brother, I confeſſe me before God and you, of what ſoeuer I haue committed againſt this rule, and acknowledge my fault therin, and doe beſeech you, to pray for me, and I doe, and will pray, for you. The wordes vttered his head was cutt off on earth, to be afterward crowned in heauen.
                  But to the end that no impediment ſhould hinder the obſeruance ofIn the 10. chapter. this rule, the holy Father S. Francis hath putt into it this clauſe, that when they ſuppoſe they cannot obſerue it in ſome certaine place, they ſhall haue recourſe to the Miniſters: meaning that where the Religious know that the by reaſon of diſturbers, corrupted condicions of the places, or oblgations expoſed againſt the rule, it cannot be obſerued according to the true, not cloaked or erroniously interpreted intelligence therof, they may in ſuch caſe and ought to haue recourſe to the Miniſters, who are obliged to putt them in ſuch place, as they may without any impediment and contradiction obſerue it. Brother Leo, and Brother Bonizzo, that were preſent with S. Francis when the Pope confirmed the rule, affirmed that when his holines very attentiuely read this clauſe (as alſo he did all the reſt: therin manifeſting himſelfe to be exceedinglie well pleaſed therewith) he very particulerie reioyced theratt: which S. Francis perceauing, he ſaid, that he would verie willinglie haue added in that place, that if the Miniſters would not prouide for the ſaid Religious, they might obſerue the rule in what place it ſhould pleaſe them: but his holines anſweared, that he had diſcreetly done in not inſerting thoſe wordes, becauſe ſuch licence might eaſilie cauſe the diuiſion of the Order, and litle reſpect vnto the ſuperiours by manie who vnder coulour of ſuch pretence would auoyde diſcipline. S. Francis replyed, I would haue added it; becauſe I know there wilbe Superiours in the Religion that will perſecute ſuch as would faithfully obſerue the ſaid rule: and if ſuch licence were admitted, the poore Religious would auoyd perſecution; but the Pope would in no ſort giue conſent, alleadging, that it ſufficed that by this rule the Religious Miniſters knew their duetie, and his intention, without making more apparant ſpecification which would take away both obedience and reſpect vnto the Superiours, and in ſteed of cauſing the obſeruance of the rule, would entierlie ruine it. Now that ſuch was the intentiō of the S. appeareth by the example following.
                  A Religious Almaine, who was a great diuine, came to viſitt ou

holy Father att our lady of Angels, where diſcourſing together of certaine pointes of the rule, the diuine ſaid vnto him: Father I vehemently deſire to obſerue the holy goſpell and our rule ſimply euen till death, as I haue already promiſed vnto God, according to his intention and yours, and I hope his diuine Maieſty well giue me force and vertue to performe it. Therefore I require this fauour of you, Father, that, if during my life, the Religious ſhall erre from the pure obſeruance of the rule, as it hath bin reuealed vnto you, and as you haue affirmed that they ſhall waxe cold within ſhort time: I may by your authority, either alone or with ſuch as will follow me in the way of Euangelicall perfectiō, ſeparate my ſelfe from thoſe that will not obſerue it. Which demaund being well vnderſtood of the S. with exceeding ioy he bleſſed him ſaying: know my Brother, that what thou requireſt, is both by me, and by IESVS CHRIST, graunted thee, and laying his hand on his head, ſaid: Thou art a true Preiſt according to the order of Melchiſedech.
               
               
                  Of a viſion that Brother Leo had, and the expoſitoin made therof by S. Francis, and of a benediction which S. Francis left to his true children.
                  THE XI. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Leo accompanying S. Francis that was very ſick, had a merueillous viſion, which is very conuenient for this place, for ſuch as are zealous of the Order, add no leſſe, for ſuch as diſpēnſe with themſelues in the profeſsion and obligation which they owe to his diuine maieſty. Being then in prayer neere vnto the S. he was rauiſhed in ſpiritt, and was conducted to the border or ſide of a violent and impetuous floud, and deuiſing how he might paſſe it, he ſaw certaine Religious that entred into it, but by the force of the water were preſently ſwallowed to the bottome, without any more ſight of them; and others that waded to the middeſt and almoſt ouer it, but by reaſon of diuers weightie thinges which they carryed on their ſhoulders, being ouercome by the violence of the water, were alſo drowned, without poſsibility of any mannes aſsiſtance. After theſe came other Religious vnburdned and without any weight: theſe were very poore, and entring into the floud did eaſilie and without any perill paſſe the ſame. Now S. Francis knowing by diuine inſpiration that Brother Leo had had a viſion, and perceauing him much diſquieted, ſaid vnto him: Brother Leo tell me what God in this prayer hath manifeſted vnto thee. Brother Leo incontinentlie recounted vnto him the circumſtances of the viſion he had, praying him to expound it, becauſe he vnderſtood it not. The holie Father failed not to comfort him, ſaying:

know that all thou haſt ſeene is true, the floud is this world, which with extreme impetuoſity runneth to perdition; The Religious which are drowned in this floud, are ſuch as accompliſh not their Euangelicall profeſsion, and the ſtrict and voluntary pouertie promiſed, but doe burdenWhat perfectiō of ſanctity of life and doctrine ought to be in the Frere Minors. themſelues with affaires of the world, which ſinck them to the bottome: the ſecond are ſuch as hauing begun the way of God, arriue to the middes, but being vanquiſhed by ſenſuality, and concupiſcence of terreſtriall thinges, forgetting their vowes, are by the violent ſtreame ouerwhelmed and drowned: the third are ſuch as hauing followed the ſpirit of God, and not of the world, haue not regarded to load themſelues with the burden of the earth, but haue bin content, with one only habit to couer them, and a morcell of bread to ſuſtaine their life, and to followe IESVS CHRIST naked on the croſſe, and therfore without any perill doe paſſe to eternall thinges, whither they are called of God.

                     THe ſaid Brother Leo an other time ſaw S. Francis, hauing before him a crucifix that walked together with him, and reſted when he reſted: the face of the S. was illuminated with a ſplendour proceeding from the crucifix. The third time he ſaw diſcend from heauen vpon his head a ſcrole wherin was written, Hic eſt gratia Dei, the grace of God is on this man.

                     THe infirmity of S. Francis vehementlie encreaſing, in ſuch ſort that all the Brethren thought he would die, by reaſon that from the euening to the houre of mattines, he ceaſſed not to auoyde bloud, and had alſo very frequent accidentes happened vnto him; all the Religious began lamentingly to ſay vnto him: Father who after IESVS CHRIST haue ingendred vs in the world, how without you ſhall we remayne orphanes and deſolate, depriued of your preſence, with which our hartes were edified, and did walke in the ſeruice of God? Wherfore, O Father, doe you ſo leaue vs without a guide? Alas moſt deere Father, who ſhall comfort our feeblenes? who ſhall cure the infirmities of our ſoule? who ſhall giue moyſture to the dryed roote of our hart, that it perſiſt in charity? ſith theſe vertues were conſerued in vs, by your holy aduertiſementes, and by the example of your holy life, and by theſe vertues we moſt ſtrictly obſerued Euangelicall pouerty. Giue vs, O Father, ſome conſolation, if it be now your houre, becauſe we who are here, in the name of all your children, that are and ſhalbe, doe

demaund your Fatherly benediction. Leaue vs Father ſome memoriall in ſigne of your holy will, that God hauing called you vnto him, we as your moſt obedient children, may perſiſt in the continuall exerciſes of your holy aduertiſmentes, and may ſay: Our Father deliuered vs ſuch ſpeeches, and recommended vnto vs ſuch thinges att his death.
                     S. Francis intending to comfort them, cauſed to be called BrotherThe Teſtament of S. Fr. Benedict of Pirra, one of the moſt ancient of the Order, A Religious of great doctrine and ſanctity, who was his Confeſſour, and ſaid maſſe vnto him euery morning: he being come, the S. faid vnto him: Write Brother Benedict, theſe wordes which I leaue as a teſtament vnto my children. I giue my benediction to all them that are and ſhalbe in my Order, euen to the worldes end. And becauſe, by reaſon of my extreme weakenes I cannot ſpeake much, I declare my laſt will, and intention to all the Religious preſent, abſent and that hereafter ſhalbe in my Religion by theſe three laſt wordes only. The firſt in ſigne and memory of my benediction and teſtament, I command you mutually to loue each other, as I haue and doe loue you. The ſecond, that you loue and alvayes keepe holy pouerty which is my miſtris. The third, that you be alwayes faithfull and ſubiect to the ſuperiours, of our Order, and to all Preiſtes of the holy church, and that you be humble and reſpectiue vnto them.
                     But God who ſaw that his ſeruant was yet very neceſſary to this his flock, and that he ſhould pourchaſe himſelfe a greater crowne in heauen, prolonged his life. S. Francis was abſolutely contrary to thoſe that deſired and procured to haue priuiledges and exemption from the Pope, touching their life, becauſe it had bin reuealed vnto him of God, that how much the Religious were priuiledged, ſo much the leſſe fruit did they produce: he would that the intelligence of the rule ſhould be taken of his wordes, being ſo cleare as they were, to any vnderſtanding, prouided that it were free from paſsiō: though they ſeemed very obſcure to ſuch as would not conforme their life thervnto, but endeauoured to wreſt &amp; draw the ſence to their libertine life: ſeeking againſt all equity to haue this their licentious life, called the life of Euangelicall perfectiō: And to proue this to be true, we ſee that thoſe firſt children of the holy Father, ſo ſimple, vertuous, and pious, found no ſuch difficulties therin, and the reaſon was, becauſe ſeeking to imitate him, they ſimply vnderſtood, and moſt dilligentlie obſerued this rule, which many that were learned neither could nor can vnderſtand with all their declarations and exclamations, of whome may be ſaid, and not without reaſon that they would not, or will not vnderſtand it, as it hath bin vnderſtood of thoſe

                  THE XII. CHAPTER.
                  THe S. was alwayes a vigilant Paſtour, to gouerne the flock which God had committed vnto him, encourageing them to prayer, to faſtinges, and to the obſeruance of holy pouertie, and teaching them to imitate the higheſt maſter IESVS CHRIST, who began firſt to doe then to teach, himſelfe doeing the like, enduring many thinges only to giue example to his children. Being one day att the Oratory of S. Eleutherius, neere vnto Rieta, he patched his habitt within and without with courſe and groſſe cloth, aſwell againſt the violent cold that then was, as for the indiſpoſition of hisHe wold not that his habitt should be peeced against his ſtomack to aſsuadge the infirmitie therof. ſtomach, which the ſaid patches did couer: he commaunded his companion to doe the ſame. But feeling that this peecing did comfort his body, he preſentlie remembred the neceſsity of his Religious, of whome hauing compaſsion, he ſaid to his companion: conſidering that I ought to be a mirour and example to my children, it is therfore neceſſarie that with them I endure cold, heat, &amp; al other neceſsities that they endure: therfore though I feele this peice much to aſſwadge the greife of my ſtomackes infirmities, neuertheles conſidering that many of my Brethren may haue this infirmitie, who cannot receaue this conſolation, I am enforced to ſuffer with them, to the end that when they ſhall ſee me alſo to endure, they may the more contentedly ſupport their infirmities. This ſaid, he incontinentlie rent of the peice, by this meane giuing to each one an example of perfection. God ſhewed vnto him how gratefull vnto his diuine maieſty is the example of Prelates to their ſubiectes, ſuch as this was, in this admirableHow much ſuperiours are boūd to giue good example to their ſubiects. enſuyng accident.
                  Hauing made a iorney to the Cardinall Protectour of his Order, vpon certaine affaires concerning the ſeruice of God, and after the diſpatch of them, hauing taken leaue of the ſaid Cardinall, before he departed the place, he went alſo to viſitt the Cardinall of S. Croſſe, a Prelate of exceeding great prudence and ſanctity, and one that loued him well, of whom alſo he was moſt graciouſly entertayned, as of him that eſpecially deſired his conuerſation. But vnderſtanding that he intended preſentlie to depart, and being exceedinglie troubled that he could no longer haue his company, taking occaſion of the time that was extreme rigorous to trauaile, aſwell by reaſon of the coldnes of the ſeaſon (for it was winter) as becauſe there was then riſen a violent

tempeſt of windes one the feildes, he ſaid: My beloued Brother, this time is not fitt to trauaile in, therfore, I will that this day you reſt your ſelfe with me, and afterwardes we will diſpoſe ourſelues according to the time: in meane while, my ſoule ſhalbe ſome what comforted &amp; edified; And that you may take no occaſiō of diſcontētmēt againſt me, I promiſe to entertaine you in quality of a poore begger, and to giue you to eat as to other beggers: for he knew that to be the thing which the S. eſpecially deſired. He beſides offered him a houſe, ſeparated from his palace and ſolitary, where with his companion he might remaine without trouble, and there performe all his ſpirituall exerciſes. Beſides all this, which much enclined the S. Br. Angelus was then with the ſaid Cardinall (he was one of the firſt diſciples of S. Francis) who much deſiring to procure contentment to this Lord, began alſo to perſwade the holy Father, telling him that neere therevnto was a ſolitary towre, where he might as conuenientlie make his prayer, as in his Oratory. In the end S. Francis being ouercome by thoſe prayers, and by the time together, wēt with the ſaid Religious to ſee the toure, which contenting him, he told the Cardinall, that to ſatisfie him, he was content for all that day to remayne with him: then he enioyned Brother Angelus, that he ſhould not permitt any perſonne to enter into the ſaid toure, whiles he ſhould be there, that with his companion he might attend to his ordinary exerciſes without any interruption.
                  
                     F. Francis is beaten of the deuils. Now the firſt night, about the firſt sleep, the deuilles came in, &amp; beate him cruelly: Wherevpon S. Francis called his companion, who was in a chamber neere vnto, to whome he recounted how he had bin handled by the deuill, ſaying. Brother, the deuils haue beaten me euen till this preſent, I will tell thee why, you muſt vnderſtand that the deuils are executioners, &amp; miniſters of the iuſtice of God, and as an earthly prince, when one hath committed an offence, or enormous fact, doth ſend the Prouoſt of the Marſhals to apprehend him, and then cauſeth him to be puniſhed: ſo God the Prince of princes by his Preuoſtes and executioners, doth chaſtice and correct, euen thoſe whome he loueth, when they neglect to doe their duety towardes his diuine Maieſty and their neighbour: and becauſe the imperfect Religious doth often ſinne by ignorance, when he knoweth not his ſinne, he permitteth him to be chaſticed by the ſaid Miniſters, to make him conſider by what way he walketh, and dilligentlie to obſerue in his exteriour and interiour, wherin he may haue offended: for God doth chaſtice in this preſent life, ſuch as he loueth, and hath determined to ſaue, leauing litle or nothing to correct in the other life, which is to be eternallie glorious vnto them. Therfore, hauing now conſidered with my ſelfe, I did not imagine I had

offended him in any thing, his mercy conſidered, for which I hane▪ not ſatisfied him, according to humane fragilitie, by confeſsion and penance: and the rather becauſe by the grace which he hath giuen, I knew in prayer althinges, wherby I could pleaſe, or diſpleaſe him: now nothing hauing till this preſent, bin reuealed vntoAnd wher

                        re. me, of this new accident, I am of opinion that God hath for no other cauſe afflicted me by his miniſters of iuſtice, but for that the Cardinall hath vſed this charitie vnto me, deteyning me here this tempeſtuous ſeaſon, though it were neceſſary for my debili
                     
                        •
                     ie: Neuertheles my Religious that now trauell ouer the world, enduring hunger, thirſt, and continuall labours, and others that are within their poore celles and Oratories, knowing that I am with the Cardinall, will take full occaſion to murmure, and ſay: we ſpend our dayes with ſo many miſeries, and our Father reſteth att his eaſe and in delightes and honours: And becauſe I know my ſelfe to be bound to giue them alwayes good example, hauing bin by God committed vnto them for Paſtour to that effect, and that my diſciples are much more edified by me when I am with them in poore Oratories, keeping them company in holy pouerty, then when I am with rich and honourable perſonnes, in place of corporall conſolation, and that they more patientlie ſupport their neceſsities, when they ſee or heare that I ſuffer with them: therfore I ſay, I acknowledge to haue exceedingly failed therin. As ſoone as the day appeared, the holy Father went to the Cardinall, to whome he related what he had endured that night, then added: Men that know me not, repute me a S. but behold how the deuills, who know me well, doe handle and chaſtice me for my ſinnes. So taking leaue of him, he retourned to his Religious.
                  In this manner did S. Francis endeauoure to giue good example of himſelfe to euery one, not only in ſmall neceſsities and weake infirmities, but in the greateſt extremities and afflictions of his life, to take away all occaſion of murmure, and that his Religious might not iuſtlie ſay of him, that in his neceſsitie he could prouide well for himſelfe, but not for them, conſidering that he endured ſuch exceſsiue dolours in his perſonne, without procuring any remedy, that the Religious who ſerued him, and they who knew it, could not containe their teares of compaſsion, and fought out ſome one, who by prayers or authority might commaund him to applie ſome neceſsary medicines. And therfore there was no Religious that tooke not courage by his example patientlie to ſuſtaine his proper and particuler infirmities and labours, in imitation of their cheife Paſtour, as alſo miſpriſe

all corporall recreation, for the feruent deſire they had to carry the croſſe, for the loue of IESVS CHRIST, and to refine themſelues in the vertue of penance.
               
               
                  Of the conditions which, according to the will of S. Francis the miniſter Generall ought to haue.
                  THE XIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Francis being once ſo weakened with ſicknes that his Religious ſuppoſing he would dye, did viſitt him extraordinarily, beginning to feele the detriment proceeding of the loſſe of his preſence: In regard wherof they were very carefull to demaund him many matters concerning the ſerenity of their conſciences, and the obſeruance of the Order. Now one of them who was very zealous of the rule and his profeſsion, made him this demaund: Beloued Father, you ſhall goe towardes God, and your family, who to this day haue alwayes followed you, ſhall remayne in this vally of teares, forſaken of you their deere Father and aſſured Paſtour. But ſince it will come to paſſe, and that there is no remedy, I moſt earneſtly beſeech you, before your departure to aſsigne vs one of our Order, if there be any worthy and capable to accept the charge and office of miniſter generall, after you. The holy Father with groning ſighes and teares thus anſweared: my ſonne I know not if there may be found a Father of ſo great a family, a head of ſo great an army of God, a Paſtour of ſo great a flock, that would be ſufficient: but I will leaue you a paterne &amp; modell, wherein may be ſeene what he ought to be. The Generall ought to be a man of great prudence, of laudable reputation, and of holy conuerſation, a man without ſelfe-loue, and particular affection: becauſe if he ſhould more fauour one part then an other, a tumult and diſcention with ſcandale would proceed therof: a man exceedinglie addicted to prayer, and a continuall practiſer therof, and neuertheleſſe, he ſhould elect and chooſe certaine houres of the day and of the night, for the benifitt and contentment of his ſoule, that in other houres he may attend to the gouernment of the flock which God ſhall haue committed vnto him: the firſt houres of the morning, lett him repaire to the place where he is to pray and celebrate maſſe, recommending himſelfe and his flock vnto the diuine protection. He muſt alſo be a man that after muſt goe forth into a publicke place, where all the Religious may commodiously ſpeake vnto him, and muſt anſweare them with humility, prouiding for each one according to his neceſsity, as to him ſhall ſeeme beſt: lett him be a man of courage,

and conſtancie, that will no be moued with others wordes, but will gouerne with iuſtice, and therfore lett him not giue light beleefe to wordes that ſhalbe reported vnto him, but lett him firſt ſearch to know the truth, then lett him proceed according to iuſtice, and lett him not diſdayne to heare indifferentlie, the litle with the great, nor haue leſſe care of the one, then the other, a man all whoſe actions may be ſo many exemplar good workes, God hauing giuen him grace to appeare ſuch by his vertues: a man that hath imprinted in him the image of piety, of ſimplicity, and of patience, labouring to create vertue in himſelfe and others, exciting euery one by his example to imitate him: a man aboue all other things deteſtinge mony, as that which is more able then any thing elſe, to corrupt our eſtate and profeſsion: a man euer mindfull that he is the head and light, ſett in an eminent place, that other Religious may ſee and follow him, to imitate him in his holy exerciſes: a man that is content, though he be Generall, with one only habitt, and one breuiary, where with to ſay his diuine office: one inck-horne and one ſeale, to prouide for the occurants of the Religious of the Order, a man not ouer much addicted to the curioſity of learning, nor ſeeking to furniſh his librarie, to the end he doe not robbe the diuine office and prayer, of much time conſuming it in the ſtudy of learning: a man principallie of condition and conuerſation, ſpiritually to comfort the deſolate, as one that muſt be the remedy and refuge of the afflicted, for feare that this vertue and remedy not being found in him, it happen that his ſheep, by their labour and vexation, be att length ſurmounted by the deteſtable and perillous diſeaſe of deſpaire: lett him be ouermore, a man fitt to humble himſelfe, according to the example of IESVS CHRIST, and ſometime to mortifie his ſence, and particuler opinion, though reaſonable, to gaine vnto God the ſoules of his ſubiectes, as did the Apoſtle S. Paul; a man that ſhutteth not the bowels of compaſsion againſt the Apoſtatats of the Order: who are as ſtrayed ſheep, to whome he ought neuer to deny mercie, conſidering their temptations were very prompt, and lett him thinck that if God would permitt him to be tempted, he perhappes would fall into a deeper pitt: a man, that, if neceſsity ſometime conſtraine him to eate meat better then ordinary, he doe eat it publikelie and not in ſecrett, that others may in like ſort be in their neceſsities prouided for: a man that, being requiſite for him principally to giue light and luſter to obſcure the darckned ſoules, doe ſeriouslie conſider what he is to doe, that he may diſcouer the true and loyall path to paſſengers, amongſt ſo many crooked, diſordered, and confuſed wayes. A man not reioycing in the honours

and fauours of the world, nor troubled in iniuryes and afflictions: a man not defiling nor in any ſort mittigating the worthy forme of iuſtice by impartiality, by deſire of conſeruing his honour, or reputation, or for whatſoeuer other reſpect, not correcting him that deſerueth recompenſe, nor fauouring him that meriteth puniſhment: a man that by his ouer-ſeuere rigour is not occaſion of the ruine or deſpaire of any ſoule, and that by his too tender compaſsion cauſeth not sloath and negligence in his ſubiectes, or by long ſufferance and indiſcreet indulgence, occaſioneth a diſſolution in diſcipline: a man that doth know how to gouerne himſelfe, to be of each one both feared and loued: a man, that att the firſt relation ſhall ſuſpecte the accuſations made againſt his Religious, till he haue duelie examined and gotten knowledge of the truth: a man, that with great feare of God, refuſeth the chardge of ſuch office, and the obligation of ſo great a Prelature, acknowledging himſelfe inſufficient of ſuch dignitie, euer reputing honour to be a great burden. And finallie a man, that diſdayneth not, yea procureth, as I would doe, and ſeeketh to haue for his companions, men adorned with holy vertues, whome he knoweth to deſire nothing for themſelues, but ſeeke only the honour of God, and the reformation of the order, the ſaluation of ſoules and of all the Brethren, and that both himſelfe and they, giue to each one good example of themſelues, comfort the Brethren in their afflictions, and appeare to all the Brethren a modell and patterne in the obſeruation of the holie goſpell and our rule, fuch ought to be my ſonne the Generall of the Frere Minors. I would alſo that ſuch a Prelate ſhould be feared, loued and honoured of all, and that all his neceſsities be prouided for, with a ſinguler loue, as true Father, and moſt louing Paſtour.
               
               
                  Of a letter which the holy Father S. Francis wrote to Brother Helyas his Vicar Generall.
                  THE XIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe holie Father S. Francis being ſick, wrote this letter following to Brother Helias his Vicar Generall that gouerned and viſited the Order. Brother, God giue you his holy benediction: I admoniſh you, to be alwayes patient in what ſoeuer you ſhall take in hand, and well diſpoſed to ſupport whatſoeuer accidēt may giue you diſcontēt. And if you ſhould be iniuriously offended by any of the Religious or other, receaue all as proceeding from the hand of God, manifeſting

to the world that you ſeeke no other thing but to loue them, and to procure them to be the true ſeruantes of IESVS CHRIST. And therfore exact no more of them then that which God ſhall giue you, and herein I will know if you loue God, my ſelfe his ſeruant and your ſelfe, to witt, if whenſoeuer any Frere Minor in the world hauing committed neuer ſo enormous offence commeth before you, he depart not without mercy, and though you afterward vnderſtand that he ſinned a thouſand times, if yet you loue him more then you would my ſelfe: and though by reaſon of feare or reuerence he ſhould not require pardon, you encouraging him ſhall demaund if he deſire it: to the end that acknowledgeing his offence, he doe penance for it; and thus much to be practiſed eſpeciallie towardes the infirme. You ſhall not faile to admoniſh the Guardians to doe the like, and that they reſolue euer to doe it. And therfore when it ſhalbe knowne that one of the Brethren hath offended and forgotten himſelfe, lett not the other Brethren diſhonour him, nor murmure at him, but lett them haue compaſsion of his fragility, remembring that the ſicke and not the healthie doe need the Phiſition. If any Religious induced by the deuill, doe fall into any mortall ſinne, I will that he be obliged vpon obedience to haue preſent recourſe vnto his Guardian who ſhall ſend him to the Prouinciall, and he receauing him compaſsionatly, ſhall haue care of him and comfort him, as himſelfe in ſuch caſe would be conforted, and he ſhall haue no authority to giue other penance to the contrite, but to ſay only vnto him, depart in peace and ſinne no more.
               
               
                  Of the Prouinciall Miniſters.
                  THE XV. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Francis would, that the Prouinciall Miniſters ſhould be equall with the other Religious, and that for their goodnes and vertue, they ſhould be loued of all, in ſuch ſort that the ſimple conceaue no feare nor apprehenſion to be vnder their gouernement and diſcipline. He would alſo that they ſhould be very diſcreet in their commandementes and compaſsionate in offences, more ready to receaue iniuries and to pardon then to reuenge, and capitall ennemies to vices: but dilligent Curers of the vicious. He would not haue them commaund the Religious in vertue of obedience, in a matter of light conſequence, for that were to lay hand preſentlie on the ſword, or to ſhew authority to commaund, or to diſcouer the commaunder to be temerarious, He deſired they ſhould be much reſpected,

but withall that their life ſhould be ſuch as might ſhine before all the Brethren as a mirour of vertue and Religion. The cauſe why he would they ſhould be loued and honoured was, by reaſon that they carryed the burden and carre of all the reſt and did meritte great recompence att Goddes hand, and great prayſe and honour with men when they charitablie preſerved and gouerned in the foreſaid manner the ſoules committed vnto their chardge,
               
               
                  How the holy Father S. Francis obtayned of God the gift of pouerty, for hinſelfe and his Order.
                  THE XVI. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Francis, as he trauayled came one night to a towne very weary, and his companion alſo who was Brother Macie: though as Religious liuing in manner of the Apoſtles, they had nothing with them to eat, and therfore, they begged it for the loue of God, and gott bread to releiue them: comming afterward to a fountaine that was nor far from the towne, they there found a very faire ſtone, as a table there expresly placed to eat vpon, wheron the holy Father hauing layd the litle bread they had, exceedinglie contented in himſelfe, ſayd: O Brother Macie, wee are not worthy of ſo great a treaſure, and ſtill rayſing his voice he often iterated the ſame wordes: Wherefore Brother Macie reaſoned with him in theſe wordes: Tell me Father if you pleaſe, how call you this extreme pouerty treaſure, where there is only bread and water without napkin to eat vpon. The holy Father anſweared, yea, I call this a very great treaſure, where there is not any thinge procured by humane induſtrie, but all adminiſtred by the diuine prouidence. The bread hath bin giuen vs for the loue of God, the fountaine and ſtoneThe praiſe of pouerty. were created of God for vs: therfore will I beſeech him to giue vs grace to loue the treaſure of pouertie with all our hart, wherof he is the only adminiſtrator and diſtributer. They alſo receaued a refection more ſpirituall then corporall, and gaue thanckes to God for it. The next morning proceeding on their iorney S. Francis on the way diſcourſed verie profondlie of pouertie, thus ſaying to his companion: Brother If we well knew the worth of holy pouertie, we ſhould finde it to be ſo diuine a treaſure and of ſuch excellencie, that we are not worthie to poſſeſſe it in ſuch baſe and vnworthie veſſels. For this is the vertue, wherbie theſe terreſtriall and tranſitory thinges are miſpriſed and trodden vnderfoot, that they may ſerue vs and not we them. This is it that

remoueth the impedimentes betweene God and vs, that our ſoule may vnite it ſelfe to her Creatour: for it giueth her winges, by which, though ſhe liue on earth, ſhe conuerſeth with the Angels in heauen. This is the vertue that accompanied our Lord IESVS CHRIST from his holy conception, euen to the croſſe, that aroſe againe with him, and in fine aſcended with him to heauen. On it eſpecially God founded his holy church, not only in the Apoſtolike eſtate, but euen in all Chriſtians, who then renounced and ſold all they poſſeſſed, and brought the price to the feet of the Apoſtles. There on alſo, may beloued Brother, hath he founded our Religion. Which lett vs therefore pray him to ſupport on that Euangelicall foundation, and to cauſe to encreaſe in an infinite number of vertues, in imitation of his beloued Sonne our Lord and maſter, and that we may with more eaſe obtaine the ſame, lett vs procure to be our interceſſors, the glorious Apoſtles S. Peter and S. Paul, the louers and preachers of holy pouerty, that in our behalfe they make interceſsiō to God to graunt vs to be truely poore and his right humble diſciples, and graunt this priuiledge to our Order, that there be alwayes therin ſuch as are truely poore, that honour and loue holy pouerty.
                  S. Francis with this feruour went to Rome in pilgrimage to viſitt the holy Apoſtles, beginning already to foreſee the great perſecutions, whichHow pouerty was graunted to S. Fr. for his Order. many of his Order would lay on pouertie after his death, and that few would aduenture to paſſe with all. Being then come to Rome, he entred into the Church of S. Peter, and being retired into a chappell, with violent effuſion of teares, he demaunded of God that he would pleaſe to confirme vnto him the grace and priuiledge of moſt holy Euangelicall pouertie, for himſelfe and his Order, inuocating for interceſſors the glorious Apoſtles S. Peter and S. Paul, who in moſt glittering ſplendour appearing vnto him, did embrace and ſalute him, then ſaid: Brother Francis, becauſe with ſuch deuotion thou demaundeſt that which God will, and we obſerue, and counſaile to be obſerued, he hath ſent vs vnto thee to aduertiſe thee in his behalfe, that thou art heard in heauen, and that he hath graunted the treaſure of Euangelicall pouertie to thee and to all them that ſhall follow thee, and that they ſhalbe of the nomber of the bleſſed who ſhall embrace the ſame. Which ſayd, they diſappeared, leauing the holy Father S. Francis exceedinglie comforted, and recounting the whole to Brother Macie, they according to their duety together yelded thanckes to God.
               
               
                  
                  Of the pouerty which the holy Father S. Francis obſerued, and would should be obſerued att table, and how the Religious were often miraculously prouided for in their neceſsitis.
                  THE XVII. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Francis being in the Oratory of Rieta, a Prouinciall repayred vnto him to celebrate with him the Natiuity of our lord. Wherfore the Religious entending to honour the feaſt and the Prouinciall, prepared the table with a cloth and white napkins, fourniſhing it with neat veſſel and meat a litle better then ordinary. But the S. cō
                     ming that morning to eat with them in the refectory; and ſeeing that preparation, and that the table was rayſed from the ground, where it accuſtomed to be, he ſecretly went foorth and finding a begger att the gate, he borrowed his hatt and cloake, then taking a companion with him, they went out of the houſe, and in the meane time the Religious ſate downe att table: for he had ordayned that when ſoeuer he was not found in the Couent att the houre of refection, they ſhould not attend him. About the middes of their meale, the holy Father retourned diſguiſed as aforeſaid, and went directly to the refectory, att the dore wherof he demaunded an almoſe for the loue of God. The Prouinciall anſwēared him: Brother, we are poore as you are, and therefore haue need of theſe almoſe: but for the loue of God which thou haſt named enter and we will giue thee part of the almoſe which IESVS CHRISTS. Fran went attired in diſguiſe of a begger to shew &amp; correct ſome litle defects of his Religious. hath ſent vs: S. Francis entred and ſtood expecting to haue ſomewhat giuen him. The Prouinciall gaue him his owne diſh, with the bread that was in it. The S. receauing it diſcouered himſelfe and ſate downe on the ground before the Religious: but being approached to the fire, he ſighing ſaid. My beloued Brethren, this table ſo decently prepared, is not fitt for poore Religious, that ought euerie day to goe aske almes from dore to dore for the loue of God, it would better beſeeme you, to follow the example of humilitie of our lord then of any other: for to that end are we called; conſidering alſo that we haue promiſed to obſerue it: now doe I eſteeme me a Frere Minor, beholding my ſelfe ſitting on the ground. The feaſtes of God and his ſainctes, ought to be honoured with that holy pouerty, wherby they haue pourchaſed heauē, and not with theſe ſuperfluityes which they did vtterlie abhorre, as thinges that did ſeparate them from the loue of God. It cannot be expreſſed, how much the poore Religious were amazed, hauing heard and ſeene this act: for many did weep ſeeing their Father ſitting on the ground with that habitt with ſo great humility correcting the fault

which they had committed, wherof accuſing them ſelues, they acknowledged their fault to the S. who bleſsing them bad them with all euer to keep their table ſo poore and hūble that the ſeculers ſeeing it, mightHe exhorteth them to obſerue pouerty. not be ſcandalized, and that if any begger came, he might be inuited to eat with them. Beſides, he would that the bread which they begged ſhould be ſo limited, that there ſhould remaine none ſuperfluous in the houſe, but what ſhould only ſuffice the Religious; aſſuring them, that if they wanted, God would prouide for them, as by the enſuing miracle doth appeare.
                  The generall chapter being on time ended, and the Miniſters dimiſſedS. Franc. multiplied bread by the ſigne of the croſse. each one to his Prouince, there remayned with S. Francis 31. Religious, amōg whome was that Brother Monaldo that merited to ſee the S. as crucified att Arles, as we haue formerly alleadged; they being vpon departure and the S. deſiringe charitably to eat with thē, there was found only three litle loanes in the houſe, which S. Francis cauſed to be brought, made on thē the ſigne of the croſſe, &amp; thē diuided it amongeſt thē, And God did ſo multiply it, that it ſufficed thē all: &amp; with the fragmēts was filled a great baskett: by meane of which miracle the Religious retourned exceedingly encouraged in the ſeruice of God and the loue of pouerty, finding by experience that God was their procuratour.
                  On an other time S. Francis comming by night to the Oratory of Sō, nino in Lombardy with many Religious, exceedingly oppreſſed with hunger, they found not in the houſe one only morcell of bread, for their cuſtome was to demaūd no more of almoſe then would ſuffice, them for one day, and if any remayned, they preſently diſtributed it to the poore.S. Franc. miraculouſly obtayned bread in a neceſſity. The holy Father S. Francis vnderſtanding thus much, ſaid to the keeper of the prouiſion: goe to ſuch a place and you ſhall finde a baskett full, bring it vnto me. He goeing thither brought thence a baskett full of bread, which had bin miraculously conueyed thither to releiue the ſeruantes of God. They all did eat with very great appetite, finding it extraordinarily pleaſing: which did not paſſe without giuing thanckes to the diuine Maieſty for the almes which ſo liberall a hand beſtowed on them. Many other ſuch miracles happened vnto theſe poore of God, as this that enſueth
                  
                     How whiles the Cooke was att his prayers in the Church, the refection was miraculously prepared. The 33. chapter of the tenth booke, transferred to this proper place.
                     SAinct Francis admitted to Religion a knight called Bennenuto, who of his great humility, made choice to liue alwayes in the kitchen. It happened on a time that a Burgeſſe had a will to refect

the Religious one morning: and to that end ſent them betimes what he thought conuenient therto, that they might prepare it att their pleaſure, which Brother Bennenuto receaued and lapped all together: then went to maſſe, where he was ſo rapt in deuotion, that all the time of ſeruice he remayned inſenſible without either memory of the kitchen or any other thing in the world. The conuentuall maſſe being ended he retourned to himſelfe, and remembred that the meat was yet to dreſſe which was ſent them, and neuertheles it was the houre of dinner: he therfore went much troubled to the kitchen, and comming neere, he heard manie perſonnes playing the Cookes, wherat admiring, he opened the dore that was ſhutt wihout, wherof he had the key: and entring he ſaw no perſon within, but onlie found the ſaid meates readie dreſt as he had purpoſed to prepare them: whervpon he gaue thanckes to God, for that he would pleaſe by the handes of his Angels, to ſupply that which he had omitted.
                  
               
               
                  How S. Francis was prayed to tell what was his intention concerning the obſeruance of Euangelicall pouerty.
                  THE XVIII. CHAPTER.
                  NOtwithſtanding the premiſes, and by how much the nomber of Religious encreaſed, ſo much neuertheles did the nomber of true obſeruers of Euangelicall pouerty diminiſh, each one ſeeking to interprett the rule in ſuch ſort as he might not be obliged to this rigorous vow of pouertie: yea there were good Religious that were putt in doubt therof by the ſubtilities of the infringers, as particulerly Brother Ricorio de la Marqueſe, who one time was very inſtant with ſainct Francis to be reſolued therin praying him to explicate his meanning concerning the obſeruance of Euangelicall pouerty, as well paſt, as preſent, and to come; that if it pleaſed God he ſuruiued him, he might giue teſtimonie to the Religious his Brethren of his true intention, and with all concerning the bookes which the Preiſtes might poſſeſſe, though they affirmed that their bookes apperteined to the Religion and not themſelues. The holie Father anſweared him: Know brother, that ſuch was my firſt intention and ſhalbe my laſt, if all the Religious would beleeue me, that none of them poſſeſſe any other thinge then one habitt, with the cord and linnen breeches, as the rule permitteth. Therfore to them that afterward affirmed that the holie Father S. Francis cauſed not the ſame to be obſerued in his time, his companions anſwered

that among many wordes which the S. vſed to his Religious, and cauſed to be written according as frō day to day God did dictate vnto him in his prayers and reuelations for the good of the Order, he diuers times ſaid, that he ſupported many thinges by reaſon of the ſcandall which might happē betweene his Religious &amp; himſelfe in the beginning of the Order, and albeit he ſaw that many waxed cold and relented he tollerated thē, in caſe that it were not in an eſſentiall matter of Religion againſt the vow; becauſe he would not debate with the diſobedient: he excuſed himſelfe herein towardes God, alleadging vnto him, that to the end his word of the augmentatition of his ſeruantes might not proue vaine, he would in himſelfe ſupply for them, wherein they were deficient, whichS. Franc. would rather that the ornaments of thealtare should be ſold then the vow of pouerty in neceſsity infringed he failed not to doe, as we haue formerlie inſerted.
                  To confirme his intention; I will relate what he one time anſweared to the Prelate of the Monaſtery of S. Mary of Angels, that asked him leaue thenceforward to receaue ſomething of the nouices that ſhould enter into Religion, to relieue the neceſsities of the Couent. The S. anſweared, that when neceſsity conſtrayned him, he ſhould ſell the ornamentes, and rather disfurniſh the altare of the virgin Mary, then doe againſt the ſtrict vow of pouerty, and the obſeruance of the rule becauſe he was certaine that the glorious Virgin would be better pleaſed, that her terreſtrialll altare ſhould be disfurniſhed, then her celeſtiall Sonne ſhould be diſobeyed.
                  An other time, Many miniſters were erneſt with him, to permitt his Religious to poſſeſſe ſomething, if not in particuler att leaſt in common, wherewith they might ſupply their neceſsity, their number being ſoGod promiſeth S. F. to haue care of all the neceſsities of the Frere Minors that hope in him. encreaſed, thut they ſometimes endured intollerable inconueniences. S. Francis then felt a great anguiſh in his ſoule, and hauing no will to anſweare thē of himſelfe, he fell to his prayer and demanded counſaile of God, who with a cleare and loud voice anſweared him: Francis I take from the Frere Minors all thinges both in common and particuler, becauſe my ſelfe alone will haue care to prouide for that familie: lett it multiplie as much as it will, for as long as it relyeth on me, and not on temporall ſubſtance, I will nouriſh it. Sainct Francis gaue this anſweare incontinentlie to the Miniſters, and exhorted them with patience to perſeuer in their firſt holie vocation, conſidering that by ſuch proceeding they ſhould be eternally comforted of God.
               
               
                  
                  Of the pouerty which ſainct Francis would that his Religious should shew in their habittes.
                  THE XIX. CHAPTER.
                  THe holie Father S. Francis would that his Religious ſhould likewiſe be cloathed with the habitt of pouerty, aſwell in the baſenes of the ſtuffe, as in the number of coates, that is with cloath of groſſe lockes and one only habitt, he deteſted them that were cloathed with three coates, or with a double garment, he ſaid that the neceſity which is not gouerned by reaſon, but followeth the pleaſure and commodities of the body, is a note that the ſpirirt is dead interiourlie, becauſe, ſaid the S. the ſpiritt being waxen cold and careleſſe of the heat of grace, wherwith one ought to be couered and defended, it is neceſſary that it make vſe of thinges appertayning to fleſh &amp; bloud, for in defect of ſpirituall releife thre remaineth to the ſoule no other remedy then that. He therfore gaue this marcke to diſcerne true neceſſity. The ſoule and the deſires doe ſhew ſignes of neceſsity, when reaſonWhat is true neceſsity. giueth ſcruple to a man of ſuch neceſsities. But for that, one muſt not ſo ſoone prouide: for if the Religious hauing neceſsity ſhould inſtātlie prouide for it, what meritt would remayne vnto him? what exerciſe of patiēce could he haue, yea where ſubiect of meritt is presēted vnto him, he by the dilligence he vſeth to prouide for himſelfe, retourneth vnto Egipt to auoide the ſufference of any thing for the loue of IESVS CHRIST which he had att other times promiſed to endure. He very ſharpely reprehend them that made difference of coulers, deſiring to haue them lighter or ſadder and to confound them with his example, he patched his habitt with peeces of the groſſeſt ſackcloth, and att the end of his life commaunded, that they ſhould bury him in his habitt couered with ſackcloth. If it chaunced ſome Religious could not ſupport this burden, he rather permitted him, to haue his vnder coate leſſe auſtere then the vpper, in which he would that in all manner, ſeueritie and pouerty ſhould appeare. He would ſometimes with extreame greife vtter theſe wordes: A time will come when this obſeruance of pouerty, will ſo relent that it will looſe his vigour, and careleſſe coldnes will raigne in place therof, becauſe the children of this poore Mother will be aſhamed, eſteeming it their honour to weare coates of delicat and precious cloath.
                  In his very time Brother Hely his vicar generall cauſed to be made an habit of fine cloath with lardge and long sleeues, which S. Francis vnderſtanding, he called him in the preſence of many Religious, and

prayed him to lend him the habitt which he woare, which he did: and the Sainct preſentlie putt it on vpon his owne, plaiting it exquiſitlie, ſetling the Capuce, and redoubling the sleeues, which he did with all the vaine geſtures which he ſaw in ſpiritt that the Religious in ſuch an habitt would vſe, then he walked with his headIuſt diſpleaſure of S.

Att length tourning to them he ſaid: honorable companie God ſaue you: which ſaid he putt of the habitt and threw it as farre as he could, being moued with exceeding great feruour of ſpiritt and zeale of God, then ſaid to Brother Helias, in ſuch ſort as each one might heare him: ſo doe the baſtardes of the Order, goe attired: then putting on his humble, ſhort, ſtrict and contemptible habitt, he chaunged countenance, and appeared gracious and mild as before, then began to conuerſe with the other Religious humblie according to his cuſtome, teaching them to be humble poore and meeke.
               
               
                  How ſainct Francis would not that his Religious should haue any thing in proper, and of the pouerty of the houſes of the Religious.
                  THE XX. CHAPTER.
                  AS the holy Father would not that his Religious ſhould poſſeſſe any thing proper, neither in particuler nor common, much leſſe would he it ſhould be ſaid that any thing was belongingS. Franc. made all the Religious of a Couent to depart thence becauſe it was told him that it was the Frere Minors. to the Religious. He chaunced one time to paſſe neere to Bolonia, where it being told him, that a monaſtery was there builded for his Religious: he for hearing that this monaſtery was his Religiouſes, comma

                      it her till their Protectour, who was then legat att Bolonia, had publiquely preached, that the ſaid houſe was his and not the Freer Minors. So would he not that they ſhould dwell in any other place, if firſt it were not aſſured that the propriety ther of had an other maſter then the Religious.
                  A Guardian that was a deere freind to S. Francis, founding an Oratorie, made alſo adioyning vnto it a litle cell for him, builded onlie with hewed wood without other faſhion. T
                        •
                     e Sainct ſeeing it, ſaid to the Religious: If you will that I vſe it, dreſſe it with oſier twigges

and bowes of trees, that I may there ſee my holie pouertie: which being done he there remayned certaine dayes, but hearing one of the Religious one time ſay, that he came to ſee his celle, he anſweared,S. Franc. left his cell becauſe ſpeaking to him one called it his. Matt. 8. ſith you ſay it is mine, it ſhall no longer be ſo, and thenceforward would no longer continue therein: the like did he in all other places, wherein he the more willingly remayned, as they were poore and meanely accommodated. To comfort his Religious he would ſometimes vſe thoſe wordes of IESVS CHRIST in the goſpell: The foxes haue holes, and the foules of the aire neſtes: but the Sonne of man hath not where to lay his head. And ſpeaking of him, he would ſay that when he remayned forty dayes and as many nightes in the deſert to pray, he had there neither cell nor bell, but was conſtrayned to reſt vnder a tree or rocke, and therfore he att leaſt did imitate him in this, that he poſſeſſed no cell, that was, or was called his: And if ſome times by miſgard he bad his Religious to accommadate him ſome cell, calling himſelfe to minde he would no longer remayne therin, thincking of what is ſaid in the goſpell. Be not carefull for theMatt. 6. morrow. He would haue it putt into his teſtament that all the celles wherin the Religious dwelt &amp; their houſe ſhould be made of clay and wood. There was euery yeare a generall chapter held att our ladie of Angels, whither repayred a great nomber of Religious, who were there very ill accomodated. The citizens of Aſsiſium conſidering this great inconuenience; and hauing compaſsion to ſee them all reſting in an houſe couered with thatch, hauing the walles made of oſier together with bowes of trees and clay, they reſolued to build them a faire great houſe againſt the church of the monaſterie, expreslie for the generall chapters there yearlie to be held, and ſo meerlie without the knoweldge of ſainct Francis, they in ſhort timeS. Franc. endeauoured to pul down a houſe which was builded to ſerue the Religious only in time of the Generall chapter. builded it with lime and ſtone, they knew well that if ſainct Francis had knowne therof, he would neuer haue permitted it; which opinion the ſucceſſe confirmed, for retourning and finding ſuch a building, though he were enformed that the inhabitantes had done it of their owne motion, and that it was to ſerue onlie for the ſaid chapter, neuertheles, fore-ſeeing the euell example, which this great houſe might giue, and that the Religious would build the like otherwhere, in which reſpect this building was inconuenient in that place, which he would haue to be an example of ſanctitie and pouertie to all others, hauing called certaine Religious that were zealous of the Order, before the chapter ended, he with them got vp on the ſaid houſe and began to vncouer it with intention vtterlie to pull it downe. Which being ſeene by ſome kinghtes and gentlemen there placed by the citty in gard to hinder

ſcandales that might happen, they came to the S. and ſaid: Father, hold your handes and know that this houſe is proper to the citty of Aſsiſiū we therefore aduertiſe you to deſiſt from further endommaging the ſame. Which the holy Father hearing, he anſweared: if the houſe be yours I will no further touch it: and calling the ſaid Religious, they deſcended, and the cittizens couered the roofe againe, and made choice of gentlemen that in time of the chapters ſhould haue care to fourniſh it as was requiſite, that the Religious might be freed of ſollicitude, which continued for many yeares.
               
               
                  Of the rule and manner of building which ſainct Francis preſcribed to his Religious.
                  THE XXI. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. F. reſiding for the infirmitie of his eyes, nere vnto Sienna, there came a rich gsntleman to viſit him, who hauing giuen to the Frere Minors a place where to build a monaſtery, and deuiſing on the forme of this building, the holy Father ſaid to this man who was verie familier to the Order, Brother, will you know how the houſes of our Religious muſt be builded? you muſt obſerue this order: when my Brethren ſhall come into any place, where they ſhall haue no place of retire, and ſhall finde any one that will permitt them to build on his land, a houſe, a garden, and other neceſsities, they muſt firſt conſider how much land will ſuffice them, hauing alwayes regard to our pouerty, and to the good example which we are bound to giue in our houſes, as well as in other thinges. And therfore, he would not that the Religious ſhould be many together in houſes, nor that they ſhould make them great, it ſeeming to him a difficult matter, that pouerty can be obſerued, where there is a great multitude. After they ſhall haue conſidered the ſcituation, and the place conuenient to erect the Monaſteries, they muſt repaire to the biſhop of the citty, and ſay to him: My lord and Father, ſuch a one, for the loue of God, and for the benefitt of his ſoule, permitteth vs to build a houſe one his land: we firſt are willing to addreſſe our ſelues to you, who are lord and Paſtour of all this flocke recommended vnto you and euen of vs, and of all the Religious that ſhall haue reſidence here where we deſire with the benediction of God and yours, to build a Monaſtery. And hauing receaued the benediction of the biſhop, lett them firſt of all take a cord, wherwith they ſhall meaſure the plott which is neceſſary for them to build the houſe, which they ſhall make poore: the matter ſhalbe, wood and ſtone, the celles ſhalbe litle, onlie ſufficient

for the Religious to repoſe therin, who ſhall alſo pray there, and ſtriue to auoyd idlenes, their churches ſhalbe litle, they ſhall not makeWhat kind of churches the Frere Minors should haue. them great vnder coulour to preach to the people therin, or for other edification: for it ſhalbe reputed greater humility, and better example, to goe to preach in other churches. When Prelates, Preiſtes, Religious and other ſeculers ſhall come to our Oratory, the poore celles and litle churches will preach to them, and they ſhalbe much better edified then by faire or good ſpeeches.
                  An other time he ſaid: The Frere Minors will often build great and ſumptuous edifices, bringing to ruine our miſtreſſe pouerty which ſhalbe cauſe of euill exāple, murmure and importunity of the people. TherforeS. Franc. foretold what the Frere Minors haue don in their buildinges. it would much better beſeeme our eſtate and the edification of ſoules, to make no ſuch buildinges: att other times vnder pretence of making chaunge for a more healthfull place, more commodious, and leſſe troubleſome, they will forſake their poore houſes to the great ſcandall of the people, to erect greater and ſuch as are abhominable to the eyes of God and pouerty, in which buildinges they will employ much almoſe gotten vnder pretext of neceſsity, wherof they ſhall yeld account to God as robbers of the almoſe of the poore. In theſe reſpectes it is much better for them to haue litle churches, in them obſeruing their profeſsion, giuing to their neighbour example of true Religious. S. Francis forbad his Religious to build their Monaſteries of other matter then wood and earth, as doe the poore of this world. There were certaine Religious of contrary opinion, alleaging diuers reaſons, as that in ſome prouinces wood and bordes were deerer then ſtones and lime, and alſo that buildinges made of lime and ſtone were of longer continuance, and more ſure: but S. Francis to auoyd contradiction would giue them no anſweare, nor did he approue their humane reaſons. To demonſtrate that he dyed with this intention, he cauſed theſe wordes to be inſerted in his teſtament, that the Frere Minors ſhould be very carefull not to accept the houſes that are builded for them, if they were not conformable to their holy pouerty: that they ſhould be as for Pilgrimes, and that they ſhould liue in them as ſtrangers. He ſometime ſaid againſt certaine learned Prelates of the Order and wiſe in erronious worldly prudence, that were alwayes directly contrary in the ſtrict obſeruance of pouerty: Wretched be the Religious that are contrary to me in ſuch matters as I know to be the will of God, and are neceſſary for conſeruation of the Order: then he ſaid to his companions: Theſe contradictions redouble mine infirmities, for ſome Religious are alwayes contrary vnto me, by the authority of their erronious ſcience and prudence, in matters reuealed vnto me by God, for the benefitt of the Order, aſwell preſent as to come, which they miſpriſe, deſiring rather to follow their owne opinion, then the will of God.
               
               
                  
                  How much he was ennemy to the vſe of ſupperfluous bookes
                  THE XXII. CHAPTER.
                  ANouice had licence of the vicar generall, to haue a pſalter, wherby to learne to read, but becauſe he heard it ſpoaken, that the holy Father S. Francis would not that the ſimple Religious ſhould haue care either of bookes or learning, he could not contentedly keepe it without approbation of S. Francis, who comming to the place where the Nouice was, who was lately profeſſed, h
                        •
                      went to him and ſaid: Father, it would be great ſatisfaction vnto me, if by your licence I might keepe the pſalter, though your vicar generall, hath permitted me, I am not yet well ſatisfied vnles you confirme it. The holy Father anſweared him: The Emperour Chaflemagne, Rouland, and all the other Pallatine and valiant warriers, with exceeding ſwetty labours and trauailes proſecuting the infidels, gott of them great victoryes and purchaced great honour, in the memory of men, the holy martyres gett farre greater glorie, in the battailes and victories, which they obtaine againſt the infernall ſpirittes and their fellowes who are wicked1. Cor. 8. men, they dying gloriouslie for the faith of IESVS CHRIST: it ſeemeth that the men of theſe times ſeeke to pourchace glorie and honour, to read or heare related theſe hiſtories without imitating thē, not conſidering their labours and their death. My childe hereof I would inferre, that thou ſhouldeſt ſeeke neither bookes nor learning, but vertuous worckes, in which conſiſt true glory, becauſe ſcience alone puffeth vp in pride, &amp; charitie edifieth. The Nouice with this anſweare departed vtterlie confounded. A litle after being tempted by the deuill he mett S. Francis att the fire, to whome he ſpake againe of theStraung temptation of a Frere Minor to haue a pſalter. pſalter: And the holie Father anſweared: My Sonne, when thou haſt leaue for the pſalter, thou wilt alſo ake for the Breuiary, then for other bookes to learne.: and when thou haſt learned any thing, thou wilt ſitt in a chaire, as if thou were a great diuine or Prelate, and wilt ſay to one of thy Brethren, Goe fetch me my breuiary. Speaking this with great feruour of ſpiritt, he tooke aſhes, wherwith rubbing his head, he ſayd: A breuiary for me, a breuiary for me; and diuers times reiterating the ſame, the Religious remayned as beſide him ſelfe, and durſt not for that time ſpeake any more of the pſalter. S. Francis ſaid further vuto him: I haue bin att times tempted, as thou art now, to haue many bookes, but to know if ſuch were the will of God, I tooke a booke, where the goſpels were written, and beſought his diuine Maieſty to voutſafe to ſhew me his will by the opening therof,

whervpon I lighted on theſe wordes of his owne: The knowledgeMatt. 13. of the miſteries of the kingdome of God, is giuen to you ſimple, and to other in paraboles. Manie monthes after that, S. Francis being att our ladie of Angels, the ſame Religious in extreme temptation, recommended againe vnto him the aforeſaid licence to haue a pſalter: to whome the holie Father ſaid: goe, doe what the vicar generall hath graunted thee. The Religious retourned whence he came, but the holy Father conſidering what he had graunted, went after him, and ouertaking him, ſaid my ſonne, retourne with me and ſhow me the place where I bid thee doe with the pſalter what the vicar generall had permitted thee. Comming thither, S. Francis fell on his knees before the ſaid Religious, ſaying: Brother I confeſſe my fault, I confeſſe my fault, then added: know that he who wilbe a good Frere Minor muſt haue nothing but his habitt, the corde, and linnen breeches as the rule enioyneth, and they that are by manifeſt neceſsitie conſtrayned, ſockes: euery thing els is ſuperfluous, and againſt the puritie and pouertie of the rule, which we promiſe God to obſerue: the ſaid Religious moued with the wordes, beleeued this holy counſaile,
                  Being by diuers demaunded the like counſaile, he anſweared them with this ſentence, right worthy to be ſett in letters of gold, and not only painted or engrauen in marble, but in the hartes of men: A man hathApothegma of S. Francis. Matt. 7. ſo much knowledge, as he is a man of vertue and loueth God and his neighbour, and no more: and the Religious ſo good, as he doeth good worckes; becauſe the tree is knowne by his fruit. When he retourned frō Syria, a Prouinciall came to viſitt him to cōferre with him of the affaires, of the Order, &amp; particulerly touching the vow of pouerty: to know his will therin, and of the obligatiō inſerted in the firſt rule, takē out of the goſpell: to witt, whē you trauaile, you ſhall carry with you neither mony nor wallett: S. Fran. anſweared, I meane thus, that the Frere Minors muſt only haue their habitt, the cord, &amp; linnen breches, as the rule ſaith, andLuc. 10. ſuch as are enforced by neceſsity, the ſockes. The Prouinciall anſweared: What ſhall I doe with ſo many bookes as I haue, that are worth more then fortie crownes? which he ſaid, becauſe he deſired to haue licence of S. Francis to enioy them, for he kept them with a remorſe of conſcience The S. replyed, Brother, I neither will, nor ought nor can doe any thing againſt my conſcience, and the profeſsion of the holy goſpell which we haue promiſed. Which this Prouinciall vnderſtāding he was exceedingly troubled: &amp; the S. perceauing him ſo ſorrowfull, with a great feruour of ſpirit ſaid vnto him, as if he had ſpoakē to all the Religious: you would ſeeme to mē to be Frere Minors, &amp; would be called Preachers of the goſpell, &amp; make ſhew to obſerue it: but in effect, you deſire

to haue propriety and ſuperfluity, and to haue a purſe. The Miniſters earneſtly ſeeke to take away the firſt rule (you ſhall not carry wallettes in your trauaile) they ſuppoſing that they ſhould ſo be freed from the obligation of this counſaile of Euangelicall perfection: but the holy Father S. Francis in the preſence of many brethren, ſaid: the Miniſters thincke to deceaue God and me, but the deceipt falleth on them ſelues. Lett them and all my other Religious know, that they are obliged to the obſeruance of Euangelicall perfection: and will that it be thus written in the beginning and end of the rule. That the Brethren are firmelie obliged to the obſeruance of the holy goſpell of our lord IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  Of the horrible malediction which S. Francis gaue to a prouinciall, and wherfore: and of the miracle that enſued.
                  THE XXIII. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Iohn Eſtitia a very learned Miniſter of the Prouince of Bolognia, ordayned an exerciſe of ſtudy in the Monaſtery of Bolognia, without licence of the holy Father S. Francis, who vnderſtanding therof, went incontinently thither, and very ſharply reprehended him by theſe wordes: I rather deſire that one obey the holy goſpell, and be employed in the ſtudy of holy prayer, where the holy Ghoſt is Maſter, then in humane ſtudies, and curious leſſons, wherin isS. Fr. did not deſire that his Religious should studie. Therfore he curſed a Prouinciall becauſe he had eſtablished a ſtudy againſt his will. loſt the ſpiritt of humility and the ſweetnes of God, the ladder wherof is this Religion, which annihilateth this new ſtudy. But S. Francis being departed, this Prouinciall began againe as before, wherat the holy Father being for the zeale of God much diſquieted, he publikelie gaue him his malediction as to a diſobedient child. By which the ſaid Brother Iohn fell incontinently very ſicke, and lying in his bedde, perceauing that his ſicknes did hourly encreaſe, ſeaſed and touched, rather with the feare he had of death, then with true contrition: he ſent, two Religious to pray S. Francis to reuoke the ſaid malediction: to whome the S. anſweared: God hath confirmed in heauen the maledictiō which I haue giuen him, ſo that he is curſed of God. In that inſtant, there fell from heauen a litle ſtone of burning brimſtone, which tranſpearced both his body and bed, and att the very houre he died, yelding an extreme infection: by this ſo ſeuere chaſticement God ſhewed how iuſt and aſſured was, the counſaile of the S. that they ſhould not be curious of bookes, but ſhould rather ſtudy to ground themſelues in holy humility, prayers, and pouerty.
                  The holy Father being once demaunded if he would conſent that the

learned who were and might enter into religion, ſhould ſtudy diuinity, hee anſweared affirmatiuelie, prouided that they imitate the example of IESVS CHRST, who prayed more then he read, as isHow he would that his Religious should ſtudy. written alſo of his diſciples, and alſo that they omitte not the ſtudie of prayer to gett learning: and that they ſtudie not onlie how they ought to ſpeake, but principallie how they may effect what they read, and doeing ſo may teach others to doe good worckes. I will that my Religious be diſciples of the goſpell, and that ſo they make progreſſe in the knowledge of the truth, and doe alſo encreaſe in puritie &amp; ſimplicity, that from the prudence of the ſerpent they doe not ſeparate the ſimplicityMatt. 10. of the doue, which IESVS CHRIST with his mouth hath vnited together. The holie Father affirmed that by meane of the knowledge of ones ſelfe, one eaſily obtayneth the knowledge of God, prouided that one ſought it with humilitie and without preſumption. Therfore he was much troubled when he knew that neglecting vertue and the vocation wherto the Religious was called of God, one ſought knowledge by curioſitie, with extreme dolour of his ſoule, ſaying: My Religious that are honoured by the curioſity of knowledge, are found emptie handed, in the times of tribulation. I would ratherVery remarckeable ſentences of S. Franc. exerciſe them in the vertue of humilitie, that the perillous times of tēptations happening, they might finde God with them in thoſe anguiſhes: for afflictions will come, againſt which, neither their bookes nor pourchaced ſcience will auaile, then would it be more expedient for them to be ſimple and feruent in obedience, humilitie, and charitie, then great in commaunding and teaching, in curioſitie of ſcience. He alreadie foreſaw that knowledge puffed vp with vanitie in future time would giue a great fall to the Order, becauſe curioſitie of the ſaid knowledge would induce manie to great arrogance, which would deſtroy obedience, humilitie, pouertie, with all true Religion; bringing in libertie and priuiledges: The ſaid holie Father ſaid: there ſhall be ſo manie that will labour to gett knowledge, that he ſhalbe happie who for the loue IESVS CHRIST ſhall ſhunne the ſame. He appeared after his death to one of his companions who was exceedinglie buſied in the ſtudie of preaching, and reprehended him ſharpelie, forbidding him that ouer great anxietie of ſpirirt which he had towardes ſtudy, and commaunded him to ſtudy to walke the path of holie humilitie and pouerty.
               
               
                  
                  How he diſcouered and preuented the deceipt of the learned, and curious of his Order.
                  THE XXIV. CHAPTER.
                  IT will ſucced (ſaid S. Francis) to theſe curious of knowledge and learning, that eſteeming to be more edified and enflamed in deuotion towardes God, by knowledge of him, if they vſe it not with great humility, they, by the ſame ſcience, and by the great ſtudy therin employed, will remayne void of all goodnes, cold in charity, and puffed with vaine glory, reioycing in their vanity, and obſtinate in opinion: wherfore the holy Ghoſt being vnable to dwell in bodyes ſubiect to ſinne, he wilbe conſtrayned vtterly to forſake them. Certaine Religious therfore one day relating vnto him that a great diuine was entred into their Religion att Paris, and that by his doctrine, he much edified the people and cleargie, and was a great honour to the Order: S. Francis ſighingly anſweared them, I much feare that his like will one day deſtroy, whatſoeuer God by me his vnworthy ſeruant hath planted in this vineyared, I would haue no greater Doctours in diuinity, then they who teach their neighbour, by worckes, meekenes, pouerty, and humility, becauſe the goodnes of a Religious is according to his obedience to the rule, and his doeing what he knoweth. Thoſe preachers that truſt only in their doctrine, when thy ſee concourſe of people, and that they are deſirously heard, and ſome by their preachingExhortations for the preachīg Frere Minors. are conuerted to penance, thy are puffed with vaine glory for the worckes of an other, as if they were their owne, and ſo preach ſaluation to others, but damnation to themſelues: therfore they glory of that wherof they haue no more cauſe then, a trumpett which ſoundeth by the mouth of an other man that windeth it: for what are they but trumpettes, wherby God ſendeth his ſound, be they good or euill, ſo that the cauſe of the conuerſion of the hearers, ought not to be attributed to them, but to the very force of holy doctrine, and to the teares of the ſimple, though the ſame be not by them vnderſtood: theſe ſimple ones are my knightes of the round table, who hide them ſelues in deſertes and ſequeſtred places the more commodiously to apply them to prayer and meditation, lamenting theirs and others ſinnes; therfore God alone knoweth the fruit they produce, and how many ſoules by their merittes are ſaued, wherfore they ſhall heare this his voice: Come thou faithfull and prudent ſeruant, becauſe thou haſt bin faithfull vnto me in few thinges, I will place there ouer many, enter into the kingdome of eternall life: but they who haue had no other cogitation but to learne

knowledge; and to demonſtrate their doctrine vnto others, preaching without edifying by good worckes, ſhalbe poore &amp; empty of all good, before the throne of the terrible iudge, they ſhall haue their veſſels full of ſhame and confuſion, and they ſhall alſo heare God ſay vnto them: you haue preached only by the wordes of your purchaced ſcience, but I haue ſaued ſoules, by vertue of the merittes of my ſimple ones, you therfore ſhall remaine with the winde of pride which you haue ſought, and theſe ſhall receaue the recompence of the labour of their humility and prayer, which is ourvocation, wherto theſe puffed ones ſhall haue bin contrary, with the winde of their knowledge perſuading many to relinquiſh this truth, yea perſecuting, as blinded and frantike, ſuch as walke by this truth, but the errour and falſe opinion, wherin in they haue liued, which they haue preached, and wherby they haue conducted many with thē in the profound goulfe of ignorāce, and ſpirituall blindnes, ſhall tourne to their greife and confuſion, and they ſhalbe buryed1. Cor. 1. in darcknes, for it is written: I will deſtroy the wiſedome of the wiſe, of this world, and the prudence of the prudent I will reiect. So the holy Father as far foorth as his power extended, for his office in this world, permitted not any of his Religious to be called Maſter, though formerlie in the world he had bin ſuch, alleadgeing vnto them the wordes of our lord IESEVS CHRIST, One is your Maſterin heauen, and therfore lett none be called maſter on earth. He affirmed of himſelfe, that thoughMatt. 23. he had bin very learned, he would neuer haue endured to be called Doctour or maſter becauſe it was to doe againſt IESVS CHRIST: ſo that he concluded that it was much more profitable to a man to knowlitle, and be humble, then to performe great matters with much knowledge, and preſumption of himſelfe.
               
               
                  How much S. Francis reioyced att the good example which his order gaue to the church, and how much diſpleaſed, when his Religious procured or cauſed any ſcandall.
                  THE XXV. CHAPTER.
                  THis glorious Father ſaid, that the Frere Minors were ſent of God in this latrer age to be an example of light to them that were entangled in the obſcurities of ſinne. Therfore if he heard relation of any example of edification, that the Religious gaue to the holy Church, he with great feruour would ſay. The houſe of God ſhalbe filled with good &amp; ſweet ſauours, which ſhalbe produced by the precious oyntmēt of vertues. He exceedingly reioyced att the good reputation of his deere childrē &amp; at the exāple of piety which they gaue, becauſe by meane therof they cōuerted ſinners, to the loue &amp; ſeruice of IESVS CHRIST, a thing

eſpecially deſired of him, and to ſuch he gaue his holy benediction, And conſequently becauſe his Religious knew that their holy Father would haue them exerciſed in this vertue, and zeale of the ſaluation of ſoules, they ſo much the more endeauoured to giue him ſatisfactiō therin.The humility of the firſt Frere Minors. And if it happened that any one procured the leaſt trouble to his neighbour, he preſently asked him pardon, with great humility and offered to doe pennance for the ſame.
                  It chaunced one time that an ancient Religious of the Order, in preſence of a gentleman, vttered ſome wordes in choler to one of his Brethren; but perceauing that he had troubled his Brother and diſedifiedMarckeable ſatisfactiō. the other, acknowledgeing his fault, and impatient againſt himſelfe, he incontinently tooke the dong of an aſſe, and putt it into his mouth: and forced himſelfe to chew it, ſaying, tongue eat this dong ſith thou haſt preſumed to ariſe againſt they neighbour and in his face to ſpett the venime of thy choller. Which the ſaid gentleman ſeeing, was exceedingly edified, and deuoted to the whole Order, preſenting himſelfe entierly to the ſeruice of it.
                  
                     How much S. F. was troubled to heare that his Religious gaue ſcandall. The holy Father S. Francis was contrarily extremely afflicted when he vnderſtood that any one had diſedified his neighbour. To this purpoſe it being related vnto him that a biſhop had reprehended one of his Religious, for hauing ſeene him doe ſomething ſauouring of hypocriſie, as to procure the growing of his beard and other thinges vnbeſeeming a Frere Minor, he ſtood vp right, and ioyning his handes, he weeping ſaid: Lord IESVS CHRIST, who hauing choſen twelue Apoſtles, one of them proued a traytor and was therfore damned, and the reſidue ouer all the world preached thy holie faith, by wordes and by pious and vertuous worckes: and now in this latter houre being mindefull of thy mercie, it hath pleaſed thee to plant the Religion of Frere Minors for helpe vnto they church, and for ſeruice of they holie faith and thy holie goſpell, haue care therof I beſeech thee for thy pietie: for if this Religion giue ſcandale in ſteed of good example, who ſhall ſatisfie thee for her? Thus vrged by zeale of the honour of God and the ſaluation of ſoules, ſtretching his armes a broad, with great effuſion of teares he vrtered theſeTerrible imprecation of S. Franc. against the ſcandalous. wordes: Good God and Father, I beſeech thee le

                        t all the Religious, who by their euill example and impious worckes shall deſtroy that which by meane of thy true Frere Minors thou haſt edified, be accurſed of thee, of thy celeſtiall court, and of me thy humble ſeruant. Vpon a day reprehending a Religious that had giuen ill example, among other thinges he ſaid this: Brother will you that I lett you know the diſpleaſure which the Religious procure me that ſcandalize others? the ſame that one ſhould doe, who hauing a rapiere in his hand ſhould often

thruſt me into the flanckes, and therwith I could not dye, ſo the noughty Religious doe augment in my ſoule greifes vpon greifes, giuing euill example and doebucher my bowels: then he added: Ah my God! if one wounded could fly him that threatneth his death, would he not fly? and why then doe not I fly into the Mountaines and deſertes, to auoid the hearing of ſuch and the like matters of my Religious?
               
               
                  Of an anſweare which God gaue to the holy Father S. Francis in prayer, being exceedingly afflicted for ſome ſcandales committed.
                  THE XXVI. CHAPTER.
                  THe afflicted S. Francis knowing that certaine Prouincialls of his Order gaue not good edification to the ſimple Religious, foreſeeing that therby many other in ſhort time might ſwarue from the obſeruance of the rule, moued with great greife which afflicted him for the zeale of the honour of God, often reiterating theſe wordes: My God I recommend vnto thee this familie, which thou haſt giuen me, he heard a voice that ſaid: Why troubleſt thou thy ſelfe poore man? Why doeſt thou ſo much afflict thee? if ſome Religious walke not my way, and giue ill example, eſteemeſt thou that I haue ſo choſen thee for Paſtour of this Religion, as that I continue not the principal Paſtour thereof? Who hath planted this Religion of Freere Minors? who cōuerteth men to pennance? who giueth them force and vertue to perſeuer in it? Tell me doe not I al this? yea I haue choſen thee expresly without learning or eloquēce, yea ſimple: that performing what lyeth in thee, thou committ the reſt to me, and that this new conuerſion of ſo great part of the world be not attributed to thy doctrine, nor to any humane induſtry: but to my grace alone. Now to the end thatt thou and all the world know, that I will watch ouer my flock; I haue placed thee there, as a blanck and paterne to all the Religious, that by what thou ſhall doe, they▪ may ſee whervnto they are obliged, and I will preſerue and maintaine them: And if it happen that ſome doe fall, others ſhall riſe. They that walke in my way, are mine and ſhall retourne to me, they that walke not in it, ſhall looſe the litle good which they ſeeme to haue. Therfore I commaund thee not ſo much to vexe they ſelfe henceforward, but onlie perſeuer in thy courſe, and know that I haue planted and conſerue this Religion which I ſo much affect, that if one of the Brethren retourne to his vomitt, I will referre his crowne to an other in his place, and if he be not borne, I will cauſe him to be borne. And that thou mayeſt

know how much I loue the Religion of thy Freres, though in the Order there remayne but three, I will not abandon them, but thoſe three ſhalbe my Religion. The poore Father was comforted with theſe wordes, and ſo ſupported all with more patience. In the Chapters he would often vſe theſe wordes to his Religious: I haue made vow and profeſsiō of the rule of Frere Minors, and all the Brethren are in like ſort obliged thervnto. I haue left the office of Gouernour of the Religious, by reaſon of mine infirmities, and withall becauſe it was permitted by his diuine maieſty for the good of my ſoule; I know the greateſt furtherance that I can giue to my Religion, is continually to pray for it, and to beſeech God to gouerne it. I am not obliged to any other thing then to giue to each one good example. And if any periſh by my euill example,The anſwere of S. Franc. to his Religious that deſired to haue generall auctority to preach I wilbe obliged to yeld account for him vnto God: Therfore they that hold the ſame rule with me, and know very well if they will, what they ought to doe, (for they ſee it practiſed both by me and others) if they doe not their duety they worck their owne damnation: God will chaſtiſe them, I ſhall not be obliged for them in that reſpect; wherin I referre my ſelfe to God.
                  Certaine Religious one time ſaid to S. Francis with a good zeale thincking therby to meritt much: Father, doe not you know that Prelalates ſometimes refuſe to giue vs leaue to preach, by reaſon wherof we ſpend much time idlye: we therfore thincke it conuenient that you ſhall doe great ſeruice to God and much good to ſoules, if you procure generall licence of the Pope to preach freely with priuiledge. The holy Father exceedingly reprehended them, foreſeeing the ſcādall that therby might eaſily arriue betweene the Clergie and his Order, and ſaid vnto thē: you Frere Minors, will not know the will of God, nor will permitt me to conuert the world, in ſuch ſort as God will I ſhould conuert it. Therfore I tell you, you ought to obtaine this licence of the Prelates themſelues with your humility &amp; the good example of your life, which cōtinuyng in you, the Prelates will pray you to preach in their dioceſſes &amp; churches and to conuert their people to pennance. After this māner they will more willingly call you to preach thē your priuiledges will doe, which will only puffe you vp in pride: and if you beleeue mine aduiſe, you ſhall endeauour to keep you from pride, from the vices of auarice, of enuy and vaine deſires ſo detrimentall to your ſoules (and by your example) to your neighbours alſo: you ſhall in your ſermons exhort the people to pay their tythes to the Preiſtes, of whome ſo▪ doeing you ſhalbe entreated to preach and heare their confeſsions, though you ſhould not ſo much reſpect that, as to conuert them: for a man conuerted will ſoone finde a confeſſour, as for me, I demaund no other priuiledge of God, but to loue and reuerence each one, and to conuert the moſt ſinners

that I can, by obedience to God and his holy church, and the ſame more by humilitie and example of the obſeruance of our rule, then by wordes.
               
               
                  Of the afflictions incident vnto the Order, reuealed vnto the holy Father S, Francis.
                  THE XXVII. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Francis being one time in prayer att our Lady of Angels, moſt inſtantlie praying his diuine maieſty that he would pleaſe to ſhew mercy to the Chriſtiā people, on whome, he had reuealed vnto him that he would lay a great ſcourge: God anſweared him: Francis if thou wilt that I haue compaſsion of my people, procure dilligentlie that thy Order perſeuer in ſuch ſort as it is inſtituted, that therin may be found ſuch as may worthelie make interceſsiō for them: and in fauour of thy Order and of thee, I promiſe thee, not to lett fall on my church that great affliction which aymeth att it &amp; threateneth it. But I will haue thee know that if thy Order doe preuaricate, the firſt puniſhmentes which I ſhall inflict on my church ſhalbe on the preachers therof, and will giue to the deuill what authority ouer them he will. Thence will grow ſo manie ſcandales betweene them and the world, that none will aduenture to take the habitt, but in the deſertes where I will preſerue this few number of elect, as I preſerued the children of Iſrael ſo manie yeares: and ſo the good being conſerued in my grace, the Order ſhall afterward be reduced to his priſtine eſtate. HerevponPropheſies 
                           〈…〉
                         Francis. did S. Francis propheſie; that a verie violent temptation ſhould be raiſed in his Religion by pourchaced ſcience, wherwith in manner of a furious winde from the region of the deſert, as the affliction of Iob furiously ſtriking the four corners of the houſe of his Religion, his owne children would bring it to ruine: becauſe, ſaid he, being puffed vp by their learning and relying theron, they well lay ambuſhes and caſt ſnares for the true and lawfull children, framed by that huge damned woman called pride, to whome they will ſacrifice their child birthes, that is, their worckes: and will liue in the delightes of the profitt of them, and of the recompence of their impudencie and arrogancie. Now the auctoritie of ſuch Religious wilbe extremelie bitter and inſupportable to the iuſte, that ſhalbe perſecuted by them: becauſe their ſimplicitie, obedience, pouertie and zeale of the honour of God, ſhall in a manner inexplicable, ſecretlie confound them. Wherfore they by reaſon of their pride being vnable to endure it, relying on the wiſedome and reputation

of their valure, and the authority of the nobility and Princes of the world, pourchaced by meane of ambition, will perſecute them to death There is alſo found a propheſie of the holy Father S. Francis, written by the hand of Brother Leo, of the great ſchiſme and diuiſion that was in the Church after the election of Pope Vrban the ſixt, the yeare 1378. that continued neere 40. yeares, the tenour wherof was thus.
                  A time will come when the holy Church ſhalbe full of ſchiſmes, which will put men in extreme perplexitie, as well in the ſpirituall, as temporall eſtate, and the deuill ſhall haue manie followers and ſhalbe more dilligente then ordinary, to take aduantage by this occaſion to augment his kingdome: then ſhall the beauty of this Order be defiled with that of others, and prophane apoſtaſie ſhalbe accompliſhed, to the diſſention of two Realmes, when few ſhall obey the holie Church with a true charitie, and he that ſhall not be canonicallie elected to the Papacie, yea ſuſpected of hereſie, ſhall be obeyed: becauſe manie ſhalbe ſubtillie peruerted by him, by his contagious errours, then ſhal ſcandales multiplie, and Chriſtianitie be diuided, manie refuſing to contradict the ſame, the ſciſmes and diuiſions of the Clergie, of Religious and of the people ſhalbe ſo violent, that if thoſe dayes were not abbreuiated by God, the elect if it were poſsible would fall into the ſame errours, if God of his mercie ſhould not deliuer them. S. Francis in regard of this reuelation particulerlie put into his rule the vow of obedience vnto the Pope, vnto his ſucceſſours canonicallie elected, and to the holie Romane church, in the beginning and end of the ſame rule, knowing how much it would profitt his order, in that ſo turbulent time to perſeuer firme: therfore he gaue this inſtruction to his, that foreſeeing the ſame, they might know to gouerne themſelues well therein.
               
               
                  Of the liberty wherinto the Order should fall, prophecied by S. Francis.
                  THE XXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe holie Father S. Francis being one day in preſence of the Cardinall Vgolino Protectour of the Order, and of manie other of his Religious, he vttered theſe wordes, which he afterward alſo preached to the Brethren: a time will come, when the Religious of my Order by the malice of the deuill, ſhallleaue the way of holie ſimplicitie and pouerty, indifferentlie receauing all ſort of mony, and all ſuch legacies as by teſtament ſhalbe bequeathed them; and leauing ſolitarie and humble places, will build faire and ſumptuous houſes in cittyes and townes, capable to entertayne Princes and Emperours:

then by fauour they will procure obtaine priuiledges of the Popes through art and humane prudence, and by their earneſt importunitie they will obtaine requeſtes merelie iniuſt, though cloaked with truth, by this meane they will not onlie abandon their rule inſtituted by IESVS CHRIST, againſt their ſolemne profeſsion: but will alſo ruine and alter the puritie therof, chaunging the good intention into peruerſe, and being armed by meane of the ſaid priuiledges, againſt obedience, againſt other Religious, and againſt all the Clergie, when they ſhall expect to gett the victory, the wretches ſhall 
                        •
                     inde themſelues fallen into the trench which themſelues ſhall haue made, gathering no other fruit of their ſeminary, but ſcandales which they ſhall offer to God in ſteed of the ſaluation of ſoules: who ſeeing the ſame ſhalbe no more thenceforward their Paſtour, but their ruiner according to their meritt: And therfore he will leaue them entangled in the nettes of auarice and their vaine deſires. Which being naturalie conſidered of many, ſhall cauſe that acknowledgeing this puniſhment of the hand of God, they repent their faultes, and retourne to their former eſtate, notwithſtanding that they be perſecuted and derided of others, as are all the vertuous and true ſeruantes of God by the wicked and impious. But as the ſame temptations ſhall accompliſh the ruine of theſe, ſo the temptations of the wicked and the afflictions of the perfidious, which the elect ſhall ſupport patientlie for the loue of IESVS CHRIST ſhalbe to them ſo manie crownes of glory.
               
               
                  Of a merueillous ſtatua that appeared to S. Francis and the expoſition therof.
                  THE XXIX. CHAPTER.
                  
                     
                        Dan. 3. THis glorious Father being one time in prayer att S. Marie of Angels, there appeared before his eyes a ſtatua of merueillous greatnes and beautie, reſembling that of Nabuchodonoſer, as the holy ſcripture deſcribeth▪ for it had the head of gold, with a moſt beautifull face, the breaſte and armes of ſiluer, the bellie and thyghesPredictiō made to S. Fr. of the four firſt times or eſtates of his Order. of metall, the legges of iron, and the feet partlie of iron, and partlie of earth and clay; it was couered with a cloake made of courſe and groſſe ſackcloth, wherof it ſeemed to be aſhamed and exceedinglie diſquieted; which did much amaze the ſaint; but the Angel that repreſented this viſion thus ſpake vnto him: Francis, wherat art thou amazed? know that God hath ſent thee this viſion full of myſterie: that ſeeing it, thou mayeſt know the mutation which wilbe in thy Religion in future time: and therfore hearcken: the head of gold which thou ſeeſt ſo faire, ſignifieth

                     The firſt estate compared to a head of Gold. the beginning of thy Religion builded in the conſtancie of Euangelicall perfection. Therfore as gold is of greater value then any other mettall, and the ſituation of the head is much more eminent in the body then any other member, ſo the beginning of thy Order, is more precious, in regard of fraternall, and golden charity and Angelicall vertue: and is of ſuch beauty and nobilitie, for the obſeruance of Euangelicall pouertie, that it ſhall fill all the world with admiration. And the queene of Saba, that is the holy church with all her faithfull ſhall admire it and feele in their hartes an incomprehenſible ioy, beholding ſo beautifull a mirour of ſanctity and ſpirituall wiſdome, and all the firſt, builded on this firſt rock, ſhalbe glorified by his diuine maieſty. Becauſe they ſhall endeauour to imitate IESVS CHRIST andThe ſecond to the breſt and armes of ſiluer. his holy vertues. The breſt and armes of ſiluer repreſent the ſecond eſtate of thine Order: ſo much inferiour to the firſt as ſiluer is more baſe then gold: But as ſiluer is of value in regard of the faire colour and worthy ſound: ſo this ſecond eſtate of the Order ſhall haue many Religious Gentlemen of diſcent, famous for learning, and renowmed for their preachinges, who ſhalbe ſo honoured in the Church, that manie of them ſhall gett the cheifeſt dignities therin, as Abbeys, Biſhopprickes, Cardinalſhips, yea euen the Papacie: and becauſe the force of a man conſiſteth principally in the armes and breaſt, God will then fourniſh thine Order, with men of ſuch valure, and of ſogood conſcience, as ſhall defend it from the potent ennemies that ſhall then perſecute it, they ſhall likewiſe helpe to ſupport the holy church, againſt the impetuous fury of heretikes and ſchiſmatikes that thē ſhall take armes againſt it. After this, ſhall come the third eſtate figured by the belly of braſſe, which is without compariſon more baſe then the ſecond. But as the greateſt quantity of monny is made of this mettall: ſo in that time the number of ſuch as ſhall eſteeme their belly their God, ſhalbe exceedingThe third the belly of metal. great. But in their greateſt glory, they ſhalbe yet confounded: for they ſhall only know the thinges appertayning to the earth. And though they be followed of many for their learning and eloquence, which they ſhall diſplay in the pulpitt, for which they ſhalbe extolled of many people that conſider only the exteriour barcke, neuertheles ſpirituall men ſhall litle eſteeme therof: for they ſhall perceaue them to affect ſenſualitie, not the honour of God and the ſaluation of ſoules. Alas, they ſhalbe reputed of God in the ſame degree, as the Apoſtle S. Paul mentioneth: that preachers without charitie are like to metall or belles that haue good ſound, but it nothing profiteth them: for according as they ſhall preach holy and ſpirituall wordes, they ſhall bring foorth ſpirituall children, and ſhall manifeſt to others the fountaine of life, but themſelues shall remaine withered

in the deſert land. The fourth eſtate shalbe ſterill and terrible.The fourth in the leggs of iron. ſignified by the legges of iron, for as iron doth mollifie braſſe, ſiluer, and gold, ſo this eſtate ſhalbe of ſuch malice and obſtinacie, in his owne opinion, that by negligence and vnaccuſtomed conditions, they ſhall forgett the good which they had built, that is the golden charitie of the firſt founders of the Order, the ſiluer verity of the ſecond, &amp; the preaching and voice of the third in the church of God. And therfore as the feet ſupport all the body, ſo they by the force of iron, and by a terreſtriall hipocriſie, ſhall ſuſtaine the body of the Order, and ſhall couer themſelues in their courſe cloake, and endeauour to make the world beleeue in exteriour apparence, that they yet liue in their former pouertie and humilitie. Theſe interiourlie shalbe rauening woulfes and to God knowne for ſuch, though to men concealed, be it that they endure afflictions by diuers tribulations as iron in the fire,
                        Sap. 6. not only by the hammers of the deuils, but euen by Princes of the world: for as the ſcripture ſaith: the great for their malices shall alſo ſupport great tormentes: they neuertheles shalbe ſo hard and ſtronge, that as the iron reſiſteth all other mettals, ſo shall they reſiſt all, aſwell Prelates as ſeculer princes, with a will to ouercome all, and ſubdue euery thing by their hardnes compared to iron: therfore ſhall they be in diſgrace with God, as hard-necked men. But as his feet are not of pure iron, but of clay alſo, that ſignifieth hipocriſie, they ſhal employ themſelues in affaires and negotiations of the world, to pleaſe and intrude themſelues into the fauour of ſeculer perſons: notwithſtanding becauſe of the great contrariety that is betweene baked clay, and iron, in ſuch ſort as it is impoſsible to vnite them together, there will ariſe ſuch a contrariety among the Religious of that latter time, that att length hauing litle reſiſted and their forces being weakened, they ſhall begin to vſe the art of hipocriſie, being impoſsible to ioyne true pride with fayned pietie, att leaſt any long time, they being att length diſcouered to be miſpriſers of the diſcipline of the Order, and conſequently of the goſpell of IESVS CHRIST, firſt they ſhalbe diuided one from an other, as baked clay is ſeparated from iron, though they ſeeme to be vnited together: and therfore hatreds, diſſentions, partialities and tyrannies ſhall begin to raigne among them, and afterwardes the world perceauing ſuch impieties and wickednes, they ſhalbe examined and chaſticed euen by the ſeculers, and this ſhall befall them becauſe they ſhalbe looſed from their head of the firſt charitie. And therfore they ſhalbe happy, who ſhalbe mindefull of the commaundements of God and of their Order: for they ſhalbe refined as gold in the fire, and though they be not knowne in the world, they ſhall neuertheles be much eſteemed of God, for he will neuer abandon

this Religion ſo that there ſhall alwayes remayne ſome competent nomber of vertuous: though in compariſon of ſo many lewd and libertines, they ſhall appeare very few: and this few ſhall be perſecuted of the world, which ſhall procure them a greater crowne with God Now the ſackcloth and cloake ſo courſe, wherof I ſeeme to be aſhamed, and diſquieted, is holy pouerty, which as it is the ornament of this Order, and the ſinguler foundation of all piety, ſo the baſtard children ſhalbe aſhamed therof, for their ayme ſhall not be to God, but to the world, and therfore, endeauouring to pleaſe it, they ſhall miſpriſe the habitt of God, and ſeeke faire and fine cloth, for the vſe wherof they ſhall importune the world, and ſhall pourchace it by way of ſimonie; and therefore happy ſhall they be that perſeuer to the end in obſeruance of their holy vowes: After theſe ſpeeches it diſappeared, and the holy Father S. Francis, remayned full of admiration and teares, with all his hart recommending vnto God his ſheep, both preſent and to come.
                  God reuealed theſe thinges and many other to his ſeruant Francis, as head and Paſtour of his Frere Minors, concerning the chaunge of his Religion, which being founded in Euangelicall perfection, exceeding difficult to be obſerued according to the world, it is not to be admired, if it be fallen, and doe decline from its perfection; We all being naturally inclined and affected to worldly thinges, and to ſhunne alll ſeueritie and rigour, and all neceſsitie, and much more freindes to our owne will, then to the will of God, which according to our ſottish prudence, cauſeth vs to make no eſteeme of the commaundementes of God, and to forke his moſt ſtrict way, though moſt neceſſarie to our ſaluation, as in deed it is: and therfore degenerating more and more we fall from our firſt Fathers. On the other ſide alſo it is not to be admired if ſome of theſe ſo fraile veſſels compoſed of earth as we are, haue demonſtrated ſuch an inuincible conſtancie, in ſo ſtrict an obligation to obſerue the goſpell; and in themſelues to preſerue ſuch a treaſure; becauſe all that is the worck of God, to the end the world may know that the eminencie and glory of this Religion, proceedeth of the vertue and power of his diuine maieſty, and not of humane force and vertue: And therfore when to him ſeemeth time conuenient, he ſendeth reformations to ſupport the ſame.
               
               
                  
                  Of the compaſsion and diſcreet charity of S. Francis to wards all his Religious, but particulerly to wardes the ſicke.
                  THE XXX. CHAPTER.
                  BEcauſe the obligation of a Prelate towardes his ſheep, doth not only extend to giue them aduiſe and ſpirituall refections, but alſo to releiue them in their corporall neceſsities, the holie Father S. Francis was repleniſhed with an infinite charitie, and had a continuall care to prouide for the corporall wantes of his beloued children, and particulerlie where ſicknes and neceſsitie were ioyned together, which charitie he exerciſed, not only of Fatherlie duetie, but of naturall compaſsion, which he euer had towardes the afflicted: which vertue he afterward redoubled to make it more meritorious: ſo that he referred all the afflictions of his neigbour, to the perſon of IESVS CHRIST, for whoſe loue they ought to be aſsited, and therfore, his hart melted, as if he had ſeen his God in them: for which cauſe, thoſe new and feruent warriers of IESVS CHRIST in the beginning of the Order, did ſo ſpeciallie exceed in leading ſeuere liues, and doeing worckes worthy of pennance, which may appeare by the enſuying example, together with the charitie of the Sainct.
                  As the Religious were one day a sleep, one of them began with a loud voice to cry: I dye: att which lamentation S. Francis inſtantlie aroſe, and cauſed all the other Brethren to ariſe, and to light a candell, then asking who was he that complained, the Religious anſweared him:S. Franc. did once eat in the night with all his Religious to accōpany a Brother that hunger oppreſſed to death. Father it is I, that dye with hunger: which hearing he preſentlie cauſed to be brought him to eat: and that he ſhould not be aſhamed, he cauſed a table to be prepared, wheron he meant to eat himſelfe; which he cauſed all the other Religious to doe though it were a verie extraordinarie houre. The Religious hauing taken his Refection, the holie Father, to teach his children the vertue of diſcretion, wherby they ſhould moderate the feruour of the ſpiritt, for conſeruation of the corporall forces in abſtinence, he ſaid. Brethren, learne and retaine in you this aduertiſement; that each one carefullie conſerue his naturall complexion and forces, and lett him vſe moderation in abſtinence, accordinge vnto them: for albeit ſome can ſuſtaine themſelues with litle food, it is not therfore reaſonable that others who cannot liue with ſo litle, ſhould keep the ſame abſtinence: for as we are obliged to forbeare ſuperfluous eating, for not damning our ſoule and conſuming our body: ſo ought we to ſhunne indiſcreet abſtinence, but muſt ſo vſe it as the bodie may

ſerue the ſoule: for God loueth mercy aboue ſacrifice, and lett euerie one remember what by charity I haue done, I haue only done▪ it as a pious worcke, and for an example of charitie, his extreme neceſſitie requiring it. And therfore lett each one refraine to cauſe the like an other time, and eſpecially Prelates towardes their Religious. Which was exceeding carefully obſerued of the S. for though he were very glad that pouerty in all thinges, ſhould appeare in them, yet would he neuer that his Religious ſhould be fruſtrate of their due releife, and therfore when he ſaw they had not ſufficient to eat, himſelfe would goe to begge, as we haue heretofore made appeare.
                  For his owne reſpect, notwithſtanding his verie feeble complexion, he was euer very ſtrict and abſtinent, yea beyond reaſon, euen from the beginning of his conuerſion to his death. Yet he is not therfore to be reprehended, conſidering that one ought not to meaſure or limitt the life of the great ſeruantes of God, who are continuallie directed in their actions by the holy Ghoſt, but we muſt permitt to worck in them, the ſpiritt and certaine exceſſes that are to be ſeene: it is ſufficient for vs to our confuſion to admire them, and therof to imitate what one can, for it was expedient, that, as many were defectiue, performing leſſe then their duety, God ſhould raiſe others that in their bodyes ſhould ſupply both for themſelues and their neighbour: and to the end that the holy Father might giue this good example of himſelfe, wheras in his ſickneſſes many thinges extraordinarie were neceſſarie for him, he would rather depriue himſelfe therof, to giue example to others
                        •
                      and when there were any Religious ſicke, he was not aſhamed to goe into the villages to ſeeke fleſh, and their other wantes, which in their health he would not haue permitted them to vſe for any thing in the world. He did alſo ſeriouslie admoniſh them to remember that they muſt be Frere Minors, not only in their health, but euen in their ſickenes, and that therfore they ſhould not haue an inſatiable ſpiritt, nor admitt all the commodities that the delicate of the world enioy, for ſo there would be no difference, nor ſhould they meritt before God, for whoſe loue they ought to be content to endure ſome inconueniences, yea euen in their ſickneſſes. Now though this holy Paſtour did zealously vtter theſe wordes: yet ſuch was his charity that ſeeing them ſicke he could not but releiue them, and ſeek to ſupply their neceſsities, and cheriſh them to his power, as by this example may appeare. One of the moſt ancient Religious of the Order being ſicke, the S. moued with cōpaſsion to ſee him ſo afflicted, ſaid to himſelfe; if this Religious had eate grapes, he would be better: then calling the Religious, he conducted him into a vineyard, neere vnto the Couent: whither being come, that the Religious might not be aſhamed, he began

firſt to eat grapes, then gaue to him, and made him ſitt downe, and ſo entertayned him that he aroſe as ſound as he had euer bin, the vertue of God worcking by the charitie of his ſeruant: which the ſaid Religious diuers times with teares recounted to his brethren.
                  
                     How the holy Father S. Francis did eate with S. Clare, and how both were rapt into extaſie. This is taken out of the 4. chapter of the 10. booke, and hither tranfferred to his proper place.
                     SAinct Francis being att our Lady of Angels, was infinite times importuned by his firſt ſpirituall daughter S. Clare, to take his refection once with her. Yet though ſhe were of ſanctity ſufficientlie knowne to all people, he would neuer conſent thereto: att lenght the glorious ſaincte fearing that when ſhe leaſt thought therof, God might call vnto him the holy Father, ſuch being the infirmities whervnto he was ſubiect, ſo that ſhe ſhould neuer enioy that conſolation in all her life, ſhe ſo much ſolicited all Religious that were moſt auncient and beſt beloued of the S. to obtaine ſo honeſt a requeſt in her behalfe, that they together ſo affectionately entreated him, as that in the end he conſented therevnto: But to auoyd ſcandall and ill example to his Religious, and that they ſhould not therby challenge a conſequence of goeing to eat att the monaſteries of Religious women, he cauſed S. Clare to come with ſome of her Religious, to our Lady of Angels, where he had conſecrated her vnto God, and he very curteously entertayned her with all her Religious, then hauing with her made a long prayer vnto the Virgin Mary, and hauing deuoutly viſited the altares, he made preparation according to his cuſtome vpon the ground, and att the ordinary houre, they ſate downe, where for the firſt courſe, he began ſo highly to diſcourſe of God, that himſelfe, S. Clare, and all the Religious were ſo rapt in extaſie, that they were no longer of this world: but hauing their eyes lifted vp, they were as it were out of themſelues.
                     Att that inſtant it ſeemed to the Burgeſſes of the citty of Aſsiſium, that they ſaw the houſe of our Lady of Angels, with althe circuit, &amp; the very Mountaines to burne: they ſeemed alſo to ſee an exceeding great fire ouer the monaſtery much more violent then the reſt: wherfore they all ran haſtely to quench it. But being come to the church, they found neither fire nor flame, but that of the holy Ghoſt, which they conſidered and very well perceaued, in the countenances and aſpectes of thoſe whome they found yet fitting and ſwallowed vp in God, with S. Clare, and all her companions: from whence awaking, &amp; all finally finding the grace of God, they did eat &amp; vſe litle other thinge,

being already ſatisfied and filled with that celeſtiall food. So euery one departed, giuing thanckes to God, who alwayes offereth and preſenteth himſelfe to them that in charitie vnite themſelues vnto him. Saincte Clare retourned to her monaſterie of S. Damian, wher here Religious receaued her with much conſolation, becauſe they feared that S. Francis would haue ſent her to found ſome monaſtery other where, as he had done her Siſter Agnes, whome he had ſent to Florence.
                     The 31. and 32. chapters are formerlie inſerted, after the laſt chap. of the firſt booke, ſo to obſerue the true Order of the life of S. Francis.
                  
               
               
                  How S. Francis knew that it was the will of God he should helpe to ſaue ſoules by his preaching, and not only by prayer: and how he instituted the Order of Penitents, called the thirde Order.
                  THE XXXIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe true ſeruant of God, deſiryng to ſerue his maſter entierlie in ſuch thinges as ſhould be moſt gratefull to his diuine maieſtie, in fidelitie and perfection of life, without reſpect to any kinde of conſolation temporall, or ſpirituall: there aroſe a doubt in his ſpiritt, wherof he diuers times conferred with his Brethren in this manner: My brethren I beſeech you by the charitie which liueth and is amongſt you, to tell me, what I ought to doe, and whither of theſe two exerciſes you eſteeme more to the ſeruice of God: either that I applie my ſelfe entierlie to prayer, or that I alſo labour in preaching, ſo to inſtruct the ignorant the way of God: I am of litle and ſimple ſtature, as you ſee, and cannot teach with wordes full of doctrine: and withall, hauing on the other ſide receaued a greater grace of God to pray, then to ſpeake, I would more willinglie applie me to continuall prayer: beſides that, I know by experience, that there is a great gaine, and a certaine augmentation of grace in prayer, wheras to preach is to impart and communicate to others, thoſe litle giftes which one receaueth of God; prayer is a luſtre of good deſires and of the pious affections of the ſoule, and a collection of celeſtiall vertues, vnited to the true and ſupreme good: but preaching is to beduſt the ſpirituall feet: that is, the amourous affections of the hart towardes God, which ſerue as feet and foundation to all the ſpirituall edifice, a man by it detourning himſelfe from ſeuerity

of life, and rigour of diſcipline. In prayer we ſpeake vnto God, and harcken vnto him when he ſpeaketh to vs, and leading a life in manner Angelicall, we more conuerſe in heauen with the Angels, then here on earth with men: wheras preaching, we muſt alwayes conuerſe with men, and liue among them, to conuert them, to tell them the truth, and to heare many worldly thinges of them: Neuertheles there is one thing in preaching verie contrarie to all theſe▪ which maketh much in behalfe therof, and is worthy of great conſideration, diſcouering vnto vs that God maketh eſteeme therof, which is, that his only Sonne, who is ſoueraigne goodnes, the only modell of diuine wiſdome, deſcended from the boſome of his eternall Father, to enſtruct the world, to teach by his holy example, and to preach vnto men, the word of ſaluation, wherby he afterwardes ſaued the predeſtinate ſoules, waſhing them with his precious bloud, reuiuing them by his death, and maintayning them by his moſt ſacred body, in the holy ſacrament of the Euchariſt, not reſeruing any thing to himſelfe which he did not graciouslie giue vnto vs to further our ſaluation; In that reſpect we are obliged by his example to doe whatſoeuer we thinck may be pleaſing vnto him, to leaue all our affections, and for a time omitting prayer, to applie vs to preaching. Further, to tell you the truth▪ on the one ſide mine owne will allureth me to repoſe: on the other, I remember when I retourned from Rome, wtih the confirmation of the rule, God reuealed vnto me that his intention was I ſhould remaine, not in deſertes, but in the world to aſsiſt the redemption of many ſoules from the ſwallow of the deuill. In regard of all theſe conſiderations, I craue your counſaile: becauſe God would neuer reueale it vnto me, for I euery day with verie great inſtance demaund the ſame of him.
                  All the Religious anſweared, that they were not capable to counſaile and ſatisfie him therin: then calling Brother Macie▪ he ſaid: Goe to thy Siſter Clare, and in my behalfe will her with all her ſiſters, to pray vnto God, that he will pleaſe to teach me to performe his ſeruice in this point: and hauing done this meſſage, goe to Mount Subaſio, to Brother Silueſter, who by the holy Ghoſt is made worthy of diuine diſcourſe, and who by his merittes obtayneth of God what grace he pleaſeth; to him deliuer from me the ſame meſſage. Brother Macie hauing accompliſhed his commiſsion, and retourning, S. Francis receaued him with verie great charitie, for he waſhed his feet, and made him eat, then conducted him to the toppe of a mouutaine, where kneeling downe, with his head bare, and armes croſſed, he ſaid to Brother Macie: What pleaſeth my Lord IESVS CHRIST that I doe: who anſweared that Brother Silueſter ſetling himſelfe to

prayer, aſſoone as he had ſpoaken, he had reuelation frō God, that he had not called him, to this vocation, for his proper and particuler benefitt: but that by meane of his preaching, many loſt ſoules might be conuerted to pennance and told him withall that the ſame had bin reuealed to S. Clare. God would haue this matter thus to proceed, that euery one might by diuers teſtimonies know, wherfore his diuine Maieſty had ſent this his ſeruant into the world. The S. of God ſtanding vpon his feet, hauing heard this anſweare which he deſired to heare on his knees, as a reſolution from the almighty, repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt; and enflamed in the loue of IESVS CHRIST, he anſweared Brother Macie, lett vs then goe Brother in the name of God, and ſo tranſported by the holy Ghoſt, he that very houre put himſelfe in iorney, hauing called Brother Angelus for a third companion: he knew not whither he went, but committed himſelfe to the conduct of the holy Ghoſt, and ſo he arriued att a towne called Carnerio, two leagues from Aſsiſium where he preached to the people, with ſo great a feruour, and generall edification, that as well the men as women, hauing heard him ſo piously to diſcourſe of the contempt of the world, and ſeing that God ſpake by him, they were ſo moued, that almoſt all of them would haue abandonned their owne houſes and followed him to effect his holy counſailes: but that the S. inſpired of God, willed them not to ſtirre: but that theyThe first occaſion and originall of the penitents of the third Order of S. Franc. ſhould liue vprightly in the feare of his diuine Maieſty, obſeruing his holy commandementes; and ſhould educate and trayne vp their children and family chriſtianlike, alwayes hoping in God, and ſhunning ſinne as their greateſt ennemy, and told them he would not faile to enſtruct thē the way to find pardon att Gods handes: But all theſe wordes were vaine for theſe people hauing no further power to reſiſt the holy Ghoſt that boyled in their hart, would not yeld to him nor be ſatisfied, till he had receaued them al for Brothers &amp; ſiſters of his order: and ſo by diuine inſpiration the glorious Father S. Francis inſtituted the third order of penitentes, which is for perſonnes of all qualities, virgins, maryed people, widowes of both ſex, wherof we ſhall particulerly treat hereafter in the ninth booke of the ſecond part.
                  
                     Of the firſt Chapter of the third Order, and of the reuelation made by one poſseſsed, vnto S. Francis; This was the eight chapter, of the ninth book, and here placed as a matter particulerly appartayning to ſainct Francis.
                     THe yeare 1222. there was among others a man of this Order called Bartholameo, a Procuratour, who hauing heard a ſermon of S. Francis, was conuerted to God, and gaue ouer the proceſſes

of the world, and being cloathed in the habitt of the third Order, he endeauored by a continuall ſpirituall labour to produce fruites worthy of pennance, ſo that he attayned to ſuch a ſanctity of life, and familiarity with the holy Father S. Francis, that he authorized him in his place for euer to admitt men and women into the third Order. It happened that this m
                           •
                         had accidentally a poſſeſſed perſon in his houſe, that did neuer reſt babling, neuertheles att the comming of S. Francis he became mute and ſo continued for three dayes, the time of S. Francis his aboad there: Which the maſter, of the houſe found very ſtraunge: yet not to moleſt the holy Father, to whome he carryed a ſinguler reuerence, he forbare to diſcouer any thing vnto him: the holy Father being departed, and the poſſeſſed beginning againe to talke, the ſaid Bartholomeo asked him in the name of God, why he had bin ſo mute, wherto the poſſeſſed reſiſting, and the coniurations augmented, att lenght he ſaid: know that till that Religious was departed, I was ſo bound of God, that I could neuer vtter one word. This man of God replyed: hath then that Religious ſo great vertue as for three dayes to make thee mute? the poſſeſſed anſweared: it is not long ſince that our Prince being with all his troupe aſſembled, gaue vs to vnderſtand, that God had neuer abandonned the world, but that he ſent it ſome of his ſeruantes, as Noe, Abraham, Moyſes, and att lenght his Sonne himſelfe; and ſince that time,An attempt &amp; aſsembly of deuils againſt the Order of Frere Minors. the charitie of Chriſtians being was ſo cold, that the benefitt of the paſsion of his Sonne, was as it were vtterlie banniſhed all memorie and conſideration, wherfore he (our Prince) much admrred that God did ſo long foabeare to giue it ſuccoure, but when he ſaw this Religious to iſſue foorth with ſuch a ſublimity of cōtempt of the world, and with ſuch a reſignation of himſelfe vnto God, yea to renew the life of IESVS CHRIST on earth, drawing after him ſuch a multitude of the world, and particulerlie of perfect men, he manifeſtlie knew that this was the man whome he feared to come: he therfore excited vs all to perſecute him, and to that purpoſe, it is not long ſince that manie thouſandes of vs were aſſembled in an oratorie, where we found meanes to ruinate his Order: for we will induce therinto the familiarity of women againſt chaſtity, and the admiſsion of yong men withour ſpiritt, againſt pouerty, magnificent and ſumptuous buildinges, proud Prelates, that ſhall haue no power to cōtaine thē
                        ſelues within the bōdes of humility, againſt obediēce diuerſity of opiniōs, and other thinges which now I wil not diſcouer: lett it ſuffice thee that we will labour ſo much as to get the vpper hād, &amp; this Order, which thou ſeeſt ſo eminent, ſhall come to ſuch ruine, and be ſo contemptible to men as is admirable. Albeit in that time there ſhall ariſe an other Religious of the ſame Order of no leſſe vertue then this Frācis. He ſhall

attaine to that ſanctity, that the third part of men ſhalbe by his example and predication conuerted to pennance: we haue now reſolued with all our poſsibility to oppugne and aſſault this order; and to that end there are lately ſent eight thouſand of my companions, to a Monaſtery where there are but ſeauen Brethren, to tempt them. This was two yeares before S. Francis receaued the ſtigmates. And though it be not receaued for a truth, becauſe it was ſpoaken by a deuill; neuertheles that which is ſince arriued cauſeth a beleife that God forced him to vtter it: this not being the firſt time that God hath manifeſted his ſecrettes vnto the world by the mouth of deuils, as in the time of our lord IESVS CHRIST, when he conſtrayned them to confeſſe that he was his true Sonne.
                  
               
               
                  How S. Francis departing from Carnerio, preached to diuers birds.
                  THE XXXIV. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Bonauenture and S. Antony doe recount, that S. Francis being departed out of the ſaid Carnerio, before he came to Benammo, he ſaw on a tree a great nomber of birdes of diuers kindes, and hard by them an other ſquadron, a matter indeed deſeruing conſideration, in regard that it ſeemed to ſignifie I know not what extraordinary thing, as it happened. For the S. inſpired of God, cauſing his companions to ſtay behinde, went to preach to the ſaid birdes, and comming neere to the tree, ſaluted them in theſe wordes: The peace of God be with you: and they ſhewing ſignes of ioy, approached all to this predication: thoſe that were on the tree deſcended to the ground, and rancked themſelues with the other, and keeping a quiet ſilence, they ſeemed to expect when the holie Father would begin: Wherfore he thus diſcourſed vnto them: My Brother Birdes, ye are exceedinglie obliged alwayes to prayſe God your Creatour, for he hath giuen you winges, wherwith you lightlie fly in the aire and whither you will, a fauour that he hath not giuen to ſo manie other Creatures. He hath alſo adorned and cloathed you with fethers, and they of diuers delectable and beautifull coulers: he hath created your bodyes light, and ſupporteth you without any paine of yours, permitting you to enioie the labours of men. He hath alſo giuen you a qualitie of ſinging verie delightfull: then he conſerueth and hath conſerued you from the beginning of the world: he miraculouslie cōſerued you from the deluge, ſending couples of euerie kinde into the arck of Noe, there to be preſerued: he hath giuen youMatt. 6. for habitation one of the foure elementes: therefore doth holie ſcripture ordinarilie call you the birdes of heauen, beſides that you poſſeſſe the

mountaines and hilles, the vallyes and plaines att your pleaſure, the fountaines, riuers, trees, and houſes for neſtes: it hath pleaſed God himſelfe by his ſacred mouth to teſtifie vnto the world, that you neither ſpinning, nor in any ſort labouring, he hath care to cloath you, both ſommer and winter, and to giue you althinges neceſſary to your conſeruation. All which benefittes, are pregnant ſignes of the loue which God beareth you as his creatures. And therfore my Brothers and ſiſters, bleſſed of God, beware that you be not ingratefull vnto his diuine Maieſty; but prayſe him alwayes deuoutlie, with your ſweet accentes, ſith he hath giuen wherwithall.
                  The Sainct hauing ended his ſermon, all theſe birdes (which is admirable) began to open their billes and beate their winges, as if they would haue ſaid, we thanke you, but being vnable verballie, bowing their heades they manifeſted vnto him, their due reuerence, and that they expected his benediction to prayſe God, and ſo to depart. The holie Father was much comforted in beholding thoſe geſtures, perceauing theſe creatures to be ſo obedient vnto their Creator; and therefore for their farwell he gaue them his benediction, which hauing receaued; they with one accord mounted into the aire, filling it with moſt pleaſing accentes, then did they diuide and ſeparate themſelues in the aire into foure bandes, conformable to the benediction which the holie Father had giuen them in forme of a croſſe. S. Francis retourned to his companions, who were as beſide themſelues ſeeing ſuch ſtraunge meruailes in vnreaſonable creatures, he asking them pardon in great humilitie, for hauing made them attend, whiles he preached to thoſe birdes, whome he found ſo prepared to heare the worde of God. He thenceforward preached, to all creatures, exhorting them to prayſe their Creatour, that all the world might yeld honour, glorie and prayſe to God.
                  
                     A short aduertiſement, for the better vnderſtanding of this miracle, and ſome other the like, contayned in this Cronicle of S. Francis: added for the better vnderſtanding of the ſimple.
                     The glorious Father S. Francis was not ignorant, that dumbe creatures, were not capable of his ſermon, and therfore preached not vnto them to inſtruct them, but to ſtir vp him ſelfe the more to admire the goodnes of God. And God (no dout) to comfort his deuout ſernant, made the very vnreaſonable creatures by a ſecret inſtinct, to reuerence the Sainct, whilſt he preached vnto them, or rather, whilſt he preached to him ſelfe in them, and by them: the holie Scripture being full of ſuch ſermons, and namelie the four laſt pſalmes of the prophet Dauid, and the Canticle of the three children in the furnace of Babilon, which what elſe are they but ſuch ſermons as Sainct Fr. made vnto theſe creatures to adore their Creator?
                  
               
               
                  
                  Of the vertue and efficacie of the holy Father S. Francis his preaching, and of certaine miracles wrought therby.
                  THE XXXV. CHAPTER.
                  THrough whatſoeuer townes and villages he trauailed, he preached with ſuch feruour and ſpiritt, and with ſuch efficacie that there was no hart ſo obdurate but was moued to pennance. Beſides that which is ſpoaken of the towne of Carnerio, it many times arriued, that there followed him more then thirty or fiue and thirty men conuerted to pennance by his diſcourſes, who did not only abandon vanities, as the cuſtome is for ten or twelue dayes, but did vtterly and entierly forſake the world, following God in his Euangelicall pouerty. He admirablie confounded the blindenes of heretikes, and exalted the faith of the Romane Church, which he performed by the meane of the ſcience which the holy Ghoſt had infuſed into him, and of the merueillous miracles which God wrought by him, who was alſo preſent &amp; fauorable vnto him in all his actions. He expelled diuels out of the humane bodyes which they poſſeſſed, and cured all diſeaſes. Wherfore men and women, poore and rich, gentlemen and yeomen, Eccleſiaſticall and ſeculers, from all partes repaired to heare and ſee him diſcourſe, as a mā deſcended from heauen: many of his hearers, without any retourne to their houſes remayned with him to doe penance. His word was as a fire that penetrated the interiour of hartes, leauing him that felt it contrite and penitent, for he preached not with an eloquence and humane ſcience, but by the holy Ghoſt and by diuine reuelation. Therfore preaching alwayes according to what IESVS CHRIST inſpired him, he vttered nothing but the ſame verity, with great zeale and without any feare or reſpect. He could not diſſemble among the great, nor much leſſe flatter them: but he reprehended their vices, and if they were guilty of publike ſinnes he corrected them with ſeuere demonſtrations, exciting them to pennance, he preached the word of God with like attention to the meaner ſort as to great perſonnes, he as carefully inſtructed a ſmall numbere as a great, for which cauſe he was indifferētlie heard of euerie one, as a man ſent them from God for their ſaluation, and ſo much the more inS. Franc. was, moued and ſtayed of it ſelfe to giue him better commodity of preaching. regard that they ſaw his wordes confirmed by miracles, as here enſueth.
                  S. Francis being one day on the ſea ſhoare att Gagette, and a great multitude of people that were very deuout vnto him flocking to heare and ſee him, and to haue his benediction, he, that ſhunned honour, being retired into a barke to hide himſelfe, felt the veſſel miraculously to moue it ſelfe from the port, and being a litle, yet enough retired, it arreſted immoueable,

as it had bin a hard marble in the middes of the waters: wherby knowing the will of God, tourning to the people who exceedingly admired the euent, he made them a very behoufull ſermon: then according to their deſire he bleſſed them with the ſigne of the croſſe, which gaue them great conſolation, and the S. inſinuating their departure, after they were retired from the ſhoare when it pleaſed the S. the barke of it ſelfe approached againe, ſo that one might ſay, the ſoule was obſtinate that refuſed to obey him, whome the very drie wood obeyd.
                  
                     Swallowes are ſilent at the comandement of S Franc. and of a ſcoller at his inuocation. Preaching in a Church att Aluiano, being exceedinglie diſturbed by the ſwalloes, he commanded them to be ſilent and giue eare to the word of God till he had done. Att thoſe wordes (which was admirable) the ſwallowes ceaſſed to flye and ſing, and neuer ſtirred till he had ended his preaching: this miracle was ſo generally ſpred with exceeding edification to all that heard it, that a ſcholler at Paris being very much diſquieted by a ſwallow, ſaid to himſelfe, this ſame ſhould be one of the ſwallowes that troubled the holie Father S. Francis when he preached: wherfore with a very ſtrong faith he ſaid, I commaund the ſwallow in vertue of the holy Father S. Francis to be ſilent and to come to me. This was not vttered in vaine, for the ſwallow by thoſe wordes conſtrayned, incontinentlie flew to his fiſt; wherat admiring, he committed her to the feildes, and after that ſhe was neither heard nor ſeene.
               
               
                  Of certaine miracles of the holy Father S. Francis.
                  THE XXXVI. CHAPTER.
                  
                     He cured a benummed child IN the citty of Thoſcauella, he cured the ſonne of a knight that had with great deuotion entertayned him, who being borne without reines could not ſtir frō where he was ſett: the S. taking him by the hand, made him ariſe and ſtand on his feet, wheron he alwayes after walked very well, &amp; as a ſound as any other, to the great contentment of the Father and all them that knew him, who therin prayſed God and his ſeruant. In the citty of Naruia S. Francis cured one of the palſey, att theOne ſick of the palſey. One of the dropſie. requeſt of the biſhop of that place, which he effected by the ſigne of the croſſe, which he made on him from the head to the feet, which being done, the ſicke aroſe inſtantlie ſound from his bed. In the biſhopprick of Riete, he cured a childe ouer-gone with the dropſie, who had his belly ſo ſwollen, that he could not ſee his feet: the Saint being moued to compaſsion by meane of the mother that brought the child vnto him, by the only touch of his hand, cured him, to the exceeding admiration, edification, and thanckeſgiuing of all that knewOne crooked. it.

He reſtored the vſe of a womans handes that were withered, by the ſigne of the croſſe, this was done in the citty of Agubio, and att the very inſtant this woman prepared dinner for the S. and many poore people. In the citty of Niuiano he reſtored ſight to a blinde, thriſe annoynting his eyes with his ſpetle, and making the ſigne of the croſſe on them in honour of the holy Trinity. At Narui he cured an other by the ſigne of the croſſe. By the ſame ſigne of the croſſe he cured the ſonne of a Gentleman of Bolonia who had a filme on his eye, which beſides the hindering of his ſight, was ſo vnſeemely and diſgracefull to behold, that it moleſted them that looked theron, This childOn blind of one eye. being full growne acknowledging this benifitt became a Frere Minor, confeſsing that he ſaw more perfectly with the eye that the S. had cured, then with the other.

In the cittie of Caſtella he deliuered an other poſſeſſed and tormented of the deuill.

                  How S. Francis goeing to preach, the Mountaine of Aluerne was giuen him by a noble man of Toſcane.
                  THE XVII. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Francis departing one time from Spoleta, to goe to Romagna, hauing taken Brother Leo for his companion, they vnderſtood by the way that a ſolemne feaſt was held in a great towne called Montfeltro where many gentlemen were aſſembled: whervpon he ſaid to his companion: Brother lett vs goe to that feaſt, we may there doe ſome good: and ſo they went and entred directlie into the Church, where then was the Lord Orland Earle of Chiuiſi, who was very deuout to S. Francis by reaſon of his reputation, and much deſired to ſee and heare him. Now this man vnderſtanding of his comming, went preſently to heare him as he began to preach on a wall, the better to be heard, and for want of a pulpitt or chaire of ſufficient hight. His theme or text was this: I hope no more, then I take pleaſure to endure: on which wordes aſsiſted by the holy Ghoſt, he deliuered worthy and merueillous matters, attributing the whole vnto the afflictions and perſecutions which the Apoſtles and Martyres of IESVS CHRIST endured, and the Confeſſours that were continuall Martyres and not of one day or momentes endurance; and this they performed by the hope and liuely faith they had in recompence of their few dayes of ſufferance to enioy a perpetuall fellicitie; and which other well liuing Chriſtians endure who ſerue God and their neighbour with a feruent charity, and who ſupport the temptations and afflictions of this world with patience reioycing in God with whome they are certaine to enioy his high and incomprehenſibles promiſes. Each one was by this diſcourſe exceedingly enflamed in the loue of God: but eſpecialy the ſaid Coūt Orlāde, who was much more ſatisfied by the preſence, doctrine, and ſpiritt of S. Francis, then by what he had heard related, or would euer haue imagined. Wherfore the ſermon being ended, he went to ſalute him and made knowne his deuotion vnto him; then told him that he earneſtly deſired (coſidering his affaires called him otherwhere) to ſpeake only four wordes vnto him in ſecrett, concerning the good eſtate of his ſoule. The holie Father graciouslie anſweared him that att his pleaſure he ſhould come to him after dinner, &amp; he would attend him; and being retourned, he a long time diſcourſed with the S. of what moſt troubled his conſcience, which the S. by the grace of God did incōtinently cleere; which done, the Count added: Father I haue a place in Toſcane, where there is a montaine of indifferent hight, called Auerne, which would be very conuenient for

you, wherin to ſpend a deuoute and contemplatiue life, becauſe it is very ſolitary, I much deſire you ſhould ſee it, and if you finde it conuenient, you ſhould doe me a fauour in accepting it for you reſidence: and certainely I ſhould eſteeme it as an extraordinary curteſie &amp; ſinguler grace. The S. as preſaging his good, though att othertimes he appeared more nice in like pointes, very willingly accepted it, &amp; told him he would ſend two Religious to ſee it, and if they found it ſuch as he deſcribed, himſelfe would dwell therin, as afterward he did: and whiles he thancked him, he commāded two of his Religious whome he ſent to vew it, that finding it conuenient, they ſhould make choice of a place for a chappell and ſhould take poſſeſsion therof, which they performed: S. Francis wiſhing a celeſtiall recompenſe to the Count, who inſtantly went to a towne which he had vnder the ſaid mountaine, where he very honorably entertayned the ſaid Religious, as Angels of God: and then ſending with them ſome of his people, he commanded them to conduct the Religious ouer all the mountaine which way they deſired. When they came thither, att the firſt ſight the place pleaſed the Religious exceedingly, and goeing further they found a very pleaſant plaine att the foot of a hill, where without further delay, being of opinion they ſhould find no place more conuenient, they began to cutt downe bowes of trees &amp; with the helpe of their guid to fix them in the earth, &amp; ſo quickly made a lodging w erin they reſted all night, taking poſſeſsion in the name of S. Francis, who they aduertiſed therof, who full of ioy, called Brother Leo, BrotherThe miraculous entertainement giuen to S. Franc. on the mount Aluerric. Angelus, Brother Macie, with whome he gaue thanckes to God: thē imparting to thē his purpoſes, they came together into the ſaid Moūtaine, vnto the toppe wherof being aſcended, he repoſed vnder the ſhadow of an oake, whither a great nomber of litle birdes incontinētly came to entertaine him, by their ſinging, with their heades and feathers diſcouering their inward ioy, which in deed was admirable to behold: for ſome flew on the head of the S. others on his shoulders, others on his handes, and his armes, with ſuch familiarity as if they had vnderſtanding. Which S. Francis perceauing, he ſaid to his companions: My beloued Brethren, I now firmely beleeue that it is Goddes pleaſure we ſhould here remaine, and therfore hauing giuen his benediction to the birdes, he proceeded to viſitt the moūtaine, where the two Religious meeting him, they ſhewed him the choice they had made for their reſidence: which did not content S. Francis, but circuited about till he had found an other place more to his ſatisfaction, where he might ſecretlie contemplate, and there with bowes of trees he built a cell, wherin ſhortly after God communicated vnto him his ſacred ſtigmates, as in due places ſhall appeare.
                  
                     
                     How in the ſaid Mountaine God appeared vnto him on a ſtone, and of the priuiledges he gaue him for the Order. This was the 34. chapter of the 10. booke, transferred to this place as proper vnto it.
                     THe holy Father reſiding in the ſaid Mountaine, our Lord appeared vnto him: who hauing manifeſted his will vnto him, &amp; being departed, the holy Father S. Francis called Brother Leo, and ſaid: Brother (ſheep of God) waſh that ſtone with water, who taking water incontinentlie waſhed it, then he bid him waſh it with wine which he did; afterward with oyle, and he waſhed it; and finally he bid him wash it with baulme, and Brother Leo anſweared that he had none, nor none was to be had in that place. S. Francis then, expounding the figure ſaid vnto him: Know Brother (sheep of IESVS CHRIST)God graunted four priuiledges to the Order of Frere Minors. that God hauing euen now appeared vnto me on this ſtone, correſpondentlie to the foure thinges wherwith I commanded thee to wash the ſame, hath graunted me foure priuiledges for our Order. The firſt, that whoſoeuer with all their hart shall loue me, the Frere Minors, and their Order, shall by his grace and mercy end their life happily. The ſecond, that whoſoeuer shall againſt reaſon perſecute the Order, shalbe notoriously punished. The third, that the Religious who shall perſeuer impious in the ſaid Order shall ſoone dye out of it, or therin shall remaine confounded. And the fourth, that the Religion shall for aſsiſtance of holy Church, continue to the end of the world.
                  
                  
                     The ſequel is the rest of the 64. chapter of the first booke, transferred hither, as the proper place therof.
                     
                        The deuil striueth violently to kil S. Francis. THe deuill being vnable to endure ſuch perfection of S. Francis and perceauing the greate fruit which he did and might produce, determined to kill him: wherfore the S. being one morning att the toppe of the mountaine, whence did hang a very deep downefall, there praying to God with all his hart, the deuill to ruine him in that downefall, thruſt him ſo violently, that he caſt him farre off, vpon a great rock of the mountaine: and wheras the deuill hath no farther power ouer vs then God permitteth him, he could in no ſort annoy him, for the S. inuocating the helpe of his diuine maieſtie,Who was receiued of a hard rock as of waxe. the rock wheron he was caſt, receaued him in, as if it had bin a heape of very tender wax, or ſoft earth, ſo that beſides the ſpace of his body, which was encloſed in the rocke, there remayned the hollow &amp; mould which he there made, as alſo the impreſsiō of his hādes &amp; fingers

when he tooke hold theron, which character or impreſsion to the great admiration of all people, is att this preſent there to be ſeene; for all is apparentlie to be diſcerned; ſo that the deuill was confounded and enraged, and the ſeruant of God miraculously conſerued, by that immenſiue vertue which is euer preſent to his ſeruantes, to releiue them as occaſion ſhall require. Such was the poſſeſsion that God gaue to his ſeruant, of this mountaine: lett vs now then retourne to ſpeake of the innocencye of the holy Father, which cauſed the birdes, as we haue ſaid, to ſecure themſelues on him, as on a ſolitarie tree, they knowing his interiour: and lett vs obſerue how many other creatures did the like.
                  
               
               
                  Of the familiarity and obedience which all kinde of creatures had vnto the holy Father S. Francis.
                  THE XXXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe ſoule of the glorious Father S. Francis was in ſuch ſort endued with ſanctitie, that he euidentlie declared that he had obtained of God, the firſt eſtate of innocencie interiour and exteriour; for in this eſtate he conſerued himſelfe perfectly ſubiect and obedient vnto God, whence followed that he was ſo much honoured and obeyed of other creatures his inferiours, ouer whome God had giuenThe brut beaſtes honoured S. Fr. shewing to acknowledg his ſanctity. him dominion, as by the examples enſuying we ſhall make appeare, Paſsing one time by the citty of Sienna, he found a great flock of ſheepe feeding in a meadoe, and comming neere them, he very curteouslie ſaluted them. They leauing their paſture (as if they had bin capable of reaſon) went towardes him, and with their head lifted vp beholding him, made ſhew that they reioyced att his preſence. The Religious companions of the S. and the ſhepheardes, were exceedinglie amazed att ſuch a nouelty, that ſheep, muttons, and lambes as reaſonable creatures, ſhould demonſtrate that they admired and reuerenced the S. They would not retourne to their feeding till the holy Father had giuen them his benediction.
                  Att our Lady of Angels one gaue him a ſheep, which he moſt gratefully receaued, for the naturall ſimplicitie, innocencie, and meeknes which is in ſheep. This holy Father admoniſhed this ſheep to be carefull to praiſe God, and to be wary not to offend or be offended by the Religious, which the ſheep to her vtmoſt obſerued and performed: yea ſo ſeriously as if it had diſcretion to obey a maſter. When the Religious went to ſing in the quire, the beaſt went alſo, and followed them to the Church, where without any inſtruction, ſhe would kneele downe;

Then in ſteed of ſinging ſhe would leap and bleat before the altare of theA sheepe sheweth a will to honour, praiſe &amp; adore God. virgin Mary, and of her Sonne the lambe without ſpott, as if ſhe would ſalute and prayſe them. And when one eleuated the ſacred hoſt att the Maſſe, ſhe inclined, kneeling downe, honouring and adoring her Creatour, as if ſhe would inuite deuout Chriſtians to giue more honour to the Sacrament, and check and reprehend the indeuout for their litle reuerence.
                  S. Francis had ſome time att Rome a litle lambe, in memory and mindfulnes of the patient lambe IESVS CHRIST: and being to depart, he recommended it to a Roman gentlewoman his deuoted freind, called Iaqueline of Serteſoli: the lambe followed her as the S. commanded it goeing and retourning from church: if the houre of maſſe did paſſe hauing heard the clock, it ſolicited her with his voice, and by geſtures, ſo that the diſciple of S. Francis was maſter ofAnd a lambe likewiſe. deuotion vnto this gentlewoman. Being in the Oratory of Grecio, on preſented him with a leuerett, but he preſently ſett him att liberty, that he might runne away, but ſeeing that he would not runne away, but was only remoued from him, he recalled it, and the leuerett incontinently lept on his legges, and he embracing it as his child, ſweetly askedA leueret became tame vnto him at an inſtant. A wild conny likewiſe. And a water bird. it why it permitted it ſelfe to be ſo taken: then hauing compaſsion of it, he deliuered it to a Religious to carry it to the mountaine, to ſome deſert and ſecure place and there to leaue it, aduertiſing it firſt that it ſhould be carefull not to be taken againe of any man. Many other like accidentes happened vnto him. In the lake of Peruſia, a wild conny being taken, and giuen to the S. aſſoone as it ſaw him, it ran and lept into his handes and boſome. Paſsing by the lake of Reite, to goe to the hermitage of Grecio, a fiſher preſented him on great deuotion with a water bird, which the S. ioyfully receauing, opened his fiſt, that it might fly away, but the bird ſtirred not: the S. lifting his eyes towardes heauen, remayned long time as in an extaſie, then comming to himſelfe as if he had retourned from ſome farre country, ſeeing the bird ſtill in his hand, he gaue it his benediction, and gently commanded it to goe whither it would: and ſo the bird hauing receaued his benediction flew merily away. In the ſame lake was giuen him a great fiſh aliue, whichAs alſo a great fish. hauing accepted, and thancked the giuer, he putt againe into the lake, the fiſh mounting preſently vpon the water, alwayes followed the S. by the riuer ſide, till he came to the place where the S. was to depart, and there ſtaying he began to ſport aboue the water, and would not depart till the S. had giuen him his benediction.

                  THE XXXIX. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Francis paſsing with his companion by the Mariſhes of Veniſe, found a great number of birdes on a tree which ſung verie melodiously, neere vnto whome he went with his companion to ſay his canonicall houres and to prayſe God with them who ſtirred not; yea the S. comming to ſay his office, they ſo rayſed their tunes, that the holie Father and his companion did not well vnderſtand one an other: wherfore he willed them to ſtay a while till they had ended theirBirdes obeyed S. Francis. office. They were incontinētly ſilent and ſung no more til the office was ſayd, after which he gaue them leaue to ſing, and then they began againe with more delight thē before, to the great contentment of the S. There was att our lady of Angels a figge tree wheron was a graſſe hopper, attOf a graſse-hopper. whoſe ſinging S. Frācis (as one that in the leaſt creatures did alwayes cō
                     ſider the greatnes of his Creatour) did oftē awake to prayſe God. He one day called her, and ſhe inſtantly flew vnto his hand. He cōmanded her by her ſong to prayſe God, and ſhe began to ſing, and neuer ceaſſed till he cōmanded her to be ſilent, and to retourne to her place: Being retourned to the figge tree, ſhe euery day att the ſame houre came flying to the handes of the S. One day he ſaid to his brethren: I will that we giue liberty to our ſiſter, which hauing done ſhe flew away, and as a true daughter of obedience was neuer ſeene after. Being ſick in the citty ofOf a pheſant. Sienna, a gentleman a deuoted freind of his, ſent him a pheaſant taken a liue, which being before him, ſhewed ſuch ſignes of familiarity, that he who brought him could not hold him, ſo great a deſire had it to come to the Sainct, who receauing it would not claſpe it in his fiſt: but carryed it att libertie, that it might fly away, but it ſetled in his handes, wherfore hauing committed it to a freind of his, to keepe, the pheſant for greife would neuer eate, till it was brought againe to the Sainct, who hauing receaued it, it began to eat verie ioyfully. A Faulcon did neſt on the mountaine of Auerne, cloſe vnto the celle of ſainctOf a Faulcon that ſerued S. F. for an alarme. Francis, which came to the Sainct as familiarlie as if he had bin a deere freind. In the night it ſerued him as an alarme or watch, ſinging att the ordinarie houres that the Sainct accuſtomed to pray, which pleaſed him will: for the care which the Faulcon had, freed him from care, and ſo much the more becauſe by diuine inſtinct, when he was ſicke, the faulcon as if it had had diſcretion, defferred his call about, two howers, or more according to the neceſsitie which the Sainct had to repoſe; att other times verie gentlie after the breake of day. This proceeding

doutles is ſtrange wherby God mayntained his ſeruant. As S. Francis was one time in his trauaile he willed his companion to prepare him to eat, which hauing done, and the Sainct bleſsing the table, a Nightingall began to ſing ſo ſweetlie, that the Sainct repleniſhed with ioy ſaid to his companion: Brother, ſee how this ſweet Nightingall inuiteth vs to prayſe God, ſing therfore with him: Brother Leo excuſingOf a nightingal. himſelfe by his vnpleaſing voice, he began himſelfe to ſinge: the nightingall being ſilent when he ſung, and ſinging when he reſted, alternatiuelie, ſo that he was allured on by that ſweet muſicke euen till night, when being wearie▪ he confeſſed to Brother Leo, that the nightingall had ouercome him in the praiſe of God, then he ſaid, lett vs eat, it is time, and being ſat the nightingall firſt flew on his head, then on his ſhoulders, and armes, and att length on his hand where it tooke of him to eat, and then hauing receaued his benediction it flew way.
                  
                     How he made gentle a very fierce woulfe. This was the 29. chapter of the 10. booke, transferred hither to his place.
                     GOeing to preach in the cittie of Agubio, he found it in deep deſpaire, by reaſon of a woulfe, that did not onlie deuoure the cattell, but killed men and women, and did eat people, in reſpect wherof they durſt not goe out of the cittie but armed in companie; and therfore the Sainct went with his companion to ſeeke out the woulfe, againſt the liking of the Cittizens who feared his aduenture, he refuſing to accept of any companie with him. The Cittizens to behold the ſucceſſe, diſperſed themſelues on the hilles and mountaines about the cittie. They expected not long, but they ſaw the woulfe with extreme furie come towardes the Sainct. The Agubians then began to cry out and bid ſainct Francis to fly, but the ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST, armed with the weapon of inuincible faith, went couragiouslie againſt him, and oppoſed againſt him the ſigne of the croſſe, and in a moment tourned the woulfe into the nature of a lambe, then curteouslie ſaid vnto him: Brother woulfe come hither, I commaund thee in the name of my God, that thou offend neither me nor any other. Att theſe wordes, which was admirable, the woulfe fell att his feet expecting what the Sainct would enioyne him, who ſaid: Thou haſt commited ſo many homicides, and made ſuch ſpoiles in this countrie, that thou haſt a thouſand times deſerued death. The ſoules of thoſe whome thou haſt murdered cry to God for iuſtice againſt thee:

but becauſe thou haſt humbled thy ſelfe, if thou promiſe amendement I will procure thy pardon. Wherto the woulfe ſeemed to anſweare clapping his taile againſt the ground, humbling his head and weeping, therby making ſhew that he would obey; which the S. vnderſtanding ſaid: Goe to, ſith henceforward thou wilt doe no more hurt, I will procure thee food of this towne for all the time of thy life: pardonning thee all the offences paſt, as if thou haddeſt neuer offended: for we know that whatſoeuer thou haſt done, thou haſt bin therto conſtrayned by neceſsity of hunger: but giue me thy faith neuer to offend more. Att which wordes the woulfe lifting vp his legge layed his paw in his hand: thou mayſt now, ſaid the S. come with me without any feare, and ſo he followed him as a litle dogge. The S. being come into a ſpacious place of the citty with the woulfe, there was ſuch affluence of people to ſee the miracle, that there could be no more. Therfore he made thē a ſermon, demonſtrating vnto them that God had ſent theſe ſcourge
                           •
                         vnto men for their ſinnes: but that the mouth of this woulfe was nothing in compariſon of that of the infernall woulfe, which afterwardes expected the ſoules to deuoure them eternally: he admoniſhed thē therfore to doe penance, if they would be freed both from the one and the other, then ſaid vnto them: My Freindes, behold here the woulfe which hath promiſed me to doe you no more miſcheife: you muſt alſo promiſe to releiue him. Which the people hauing promiſed him, he tourned to the woulfe and bad him promiſe them alſo to doe them no more hurt, and to aske them pardon. Admirable accident! the woulfe in ſigne of repētance incontinently falling one his knees laid his Muzzle on the ground, and the S. cauſing him againe to giue his paw in pledge of peace, I promiſe ſaid he, for the one and the other party, and ſo he liued two full yeares in the middes of the citty, without any dogges barcking att him: then he dyed to the great greife of all the Cittizens, who ſeeing him, were induced to the loue of God, by the memory of ſo rare a miracle and benefitt which he had done them, by meane of his ſeruant S. Francis.
                  
               
               
                  How it being neceſsary that ſainct Francis should haue a cautere made with a burning iron, the fire obeying him loſt his force.
                  THE XL. CHAPTER.
                  NOt onlie the beaſtes obeyed S. Francis: but euen the very elementes, as may appeare by the example following, and others to be inſerted hereafter. The glorious Father was long time afflicted with ſicknes, and hauing no meanes of cure, he was, by reaſon

that the cold was aduerſiue vnto him, as the Protectour had appointed, remoued from Rieta to Fonte Colombo, for better commodity of the Phiſicion that had care of him; and to defend him from the aire that was verie dangerous vnto him, and from the ſplendour of the ſunne which he could not endure, they made him a great capuce,, and put a gread bande ouer his eyes. Now the Phiſicion being come and perceauing the danger of the diſeaſe, affirmed that there muſt neceſſarilie be applyed a cautere behind the eare, next that eye which was moſt offended, in which act, though the holy Father S. Francis deferred his cure, fearing perhappes to dye in the abſence of the Vicar Generall who was to be there: neuertheles the infirmitie encreaſing and the Vicar not comming, it was neceſſarie to proceed and to applie the fire, and eſpeciallie becauſe in a whole night he could take no repoſe. Wherfore the night following he made this exhortatiō to the Religious that attended and watched with him, taking compaſsion of him that by his occaſion, he repoſed neither night nor day no more then him ſelfe: Brother and my beloued ſonne, I beſeech thee lett it not afflict thee, to ſuffer and take paines for me in this my ſicknes: for God will giue thee recompenſe of thy labour both in this life and the other: and will reward thee euen for all the good worckes thou omitteſt to doe by meanes of mine infirmitie. Yea I aduertiſe thee that thou gayneſt much more by this charitie, then thou ſhouldeſt by prayer; for they that ſerue and aſsiſt me in ſuch neceſsitie, ſerue all the bodie of our Order and aſsiſt to mayntaine it. Therfore thou mayeſt ſecurelie ſay vnto God, offering this thy ſeruice: My God I ſpend my time in ſeruice of this man, for which thou art indebted to me, conſidering that I ſerue him for thy ſake. The S. ſpake this, to the end that being by the deuill ouercome of impatience, he ſhould not looſe his meritt. And therfore as we ſaid a litle before, ſeeing the imminent perill wherin he laboured, and the trouble of his Religious, he conſented that preparation ſhould be made to adminiſter vnto him the cautere appointed by the Phiſicion, though his vicare were not preſent. Euerie thing neceſsa
                        •
                     ie then being prepared, S. Francis ſeeing the burning iron, had a naturall feare of the torment he was to endure: wherfore he mildlie vttered theſe wordes to the fire: My noble brother, moſt profitable of all other creatures by the almightie created, I pray thee with my vtmoſt affection, haue compaſsion of me in this thine action, and vſe not thy rigour againſt me, ſith I loue thee ſo much for our Creatours ſake, of whome I demaund ſo much fauour, as to moderate thy feruour and heat in ſuch ſort that my feebleneſſe may ſupport it. Then he made the ſigne of the croſſe on the fierie bullet, when in meane while the Religious left him alone with the Surgeon, for great compaſsion they

had of him, and being vnable to behold his torment and endurance. Now the iron hauing bin applied the S. recalling them they retourned, to whome he ſaid: O weake of hart and more weake of faith! why did you fly? I would haue you know that I felt not any payne, yea if it be thought that the Surgeon haue not well made the cautere, I am content to haue an other made, then an other, till it be well made. The Surgeon and Religious being amazed att ſo ſtrang a miracle, wherby he ſaw force did faile to annoy but not to benefitt, in ſuch ſort that the S. held himſelfe immoueable without hauing his head held, and inſenſible of the hoat iron, he knew not what elſe to ſay but that in effect, there was no other good in this world, but to be the true ſeruant of almighty God.
               
               
                  Of the loue which the holy Father S. Francis boare to all creatures for the loue of his Creatour.
                  THE XLI. CHAPTER.
                  BVt it is not ſo much to be admired that the fire and other creatures obeyed S. Francis when he commanded them: for he in ſuch ſort honoured and loued them, that he reioyced with them att their good, and was ſo much afflicted att their detriment, as a freind were he neuer ſo pittifull and affectionat would doe att the dommage or detriment of his deere freind. He would diſcourſe with them as if they had bin endued with iudgement and reaſon, rayſing himſelfe by their meane condition, to the conſideration of the greatnes of him that had created them ſuch, therfore aboue others he carryed moſt affection to thoſe creatures that had any relation vnto God, or figure, correſpondence and proprietye with his ſeruantes, as may be ſaid of Larckes, as hauing on their head a capuce, like to his and his Religious. And becauſe they were humble and of earthlie colour, and walked by ditches and ordinarie wayes to ſeeke their releife, and then mounted ſweetlie intoWhat esteeme he made of larckes. the aire, prayſing their God. Wherin they ſhewed him example (as he ſaid to his Religious) to be cloathed with baſe and courſe cloth of earthly colour, and to goe humblie ſeeking almoſe through the ſtreetes, and hauing conuerſed here on earth as much as is neceſſarie, to mount afterwardes into heauen with their cogitations prayſing their Creatour. And therfore he once ſaid, that if he were Emperour he would ordaine that no Larckes ſhould be killed. Diſcourſing afterwardes of other creatures, he ſaid that he would command all

Gouernours of citties and borroughes to cauſe wheat to be ſcattered and caſt abroad on Chriſtiās day in the ſtreetes &amp; feildes, that the birdes might haue more occaſiō on that day to reioyce hauing to feed att their deſire: and in memory that our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST was borne between an oxe and an aſſe, they who had ſuch beaſtes ſhould be conſtrayned to giue them on ſuch day, hay and oates abondantly. Among all creatures he particulerly affected the ſunne, the reaſon hath bin formerly expreſſed, next vnto it, the fire, as a moſt noble element, he would neuer putt it out, in conſideration of the innumerable benefittes which God by meane therof hath done vs, as by the examples enſuying ſhall appeare. Sitting one day before the fire, there lept into his lappe vponHow he loued the elemen
                           •
                         of fire. his habitt certaine litle ſparckles as it often happeneth, and albeit he ſaw it burne his habitt he would neuer extinguiſh it, nor permitt a Religious there preſent to doe it, who att length called the Vicar whome againſt his will and by obedience he permitted to extinguiſh it. An other time on the Mountaine of Aluerne, a Religious that was his companion made a great fire in the celle where he did eat, by reaſon of the extreme cold that then was, which leauing enkindled, he went to call the holy Father who was in an other place, adioyning to the celle where he accuſtomed to pray and sleepe; where S. Francis ſtaying him to read vnto him the goſpell of that day (which if it were poſsible he accuſtomed alwayes to doe before his refection, when it chaunced that he could not here maſſe) the fire in meane while ſo wrought, that when they thought to come to warme themſelues, it was mounted euen to the planching of one ſide of the celle: S. Francis ſeeing his companion labour to quench it did not aſsiſt him, but taking vp a skinne of furre that was there wherwith he couered himſelfe in the night, he retourned into the mountaine, the other Religious perceauing the fire, came all out of their Oratorie, and extinguiſhed it in an inſtant: which being done S. Francis goeing to eat, ſaid to his companion: I will no more vſe this skinne of furre, becauſe by▪ reaſon of mine auarice I could not endure that my Brother fire ſhould conſume it for it ſelfe. After the fire he affected the element ofAnd the water. water, becauſe by it was ſignified penance and affliction: by reaſon that with it the ſoule was waſhed by meane of the ſacrament of Baptiſme: therfore when he waſhed his face and handes, he alwayes ſought a place where the water falling away might not be trodden on and fowled. He alſo reuerenced the ſtones, ſo that ſometimesThe ſtones. The wood. he trēbled to tread on them, remembring the corner ſtone I. C. He cōmaunded the Religious that made prouiſion of wood on the mōtaine, not to fell the whole tree, but alwayes to leaue a great ſtocke in remembrance

of him that for our ſaluation would dye on the hard wood of the croſſe. He forbad the gardenet to take vp an entier plant and rooteAnd the flowers. together to be eaten, as many doe: but commanded him to leaue ſufficient wherby to ſpring againe, that in ſeaſon it might produce flowers, for his ſake and in memory of him that would be tearmed a flower. He would that the gardener ſhould make a litle guarden alone and ſeuerall from the greater, of ſweet delicious and pleaſing herbes to behold, that producing flowers in their ſeaſon, they might be inuited each one to prayſe God for their beauty, conſidering that all creatures ſpeake in their language, and ſay: Man, God hath made and created vs for thee alone, to the end that thou praiſe our Creatour by vs and in all his worckes. Therfore he would haue them of all perſonnes eſteemed as a mirour, which beholding, they might admire the greatenes of their Creatour, and might alwayes ſeeke ſome ſubiectes the more to loue, honour and adore him.
               
               
                  Of a miracle intituled of apples, becauſe Sainct Francis demaunding apples, raiſed a child.
                  THE XLII. CHAPTER.
                  A Gentleman that was a deere freind vnto the S. inuited him to dine att his houſe when his opportunity would beſt permitt. S. Francis anſweared that on ſuch a day he would preach in his citty, and then he would ſatisfie his requeſt. The day ſo much deſired of the gentleman being come, hauing taken order in his houſe for the dinner, and left a ſeruant att home to that purpoſe, himſelfe with his wife went to heare the ſermon: but they being departed the ſeruant who alſo had chardge of a litle childe, ſaid to her ſelfe: euery one runneth to heare this great S. of God, and is it poſsible that I alone muſt be barred from hearing him? verily I will heare att leaſt a litle, and then will retourne before the reſt in ſufficient time to prepare my dinner: which ſhe did, but hearing the ſermon ſhe remembred that ſhe had left the litle child alone, wherfore ſhe inſtantlie retourned home, and not finding the child where ſhe had left it, hauing in vaine ſought him euery where; and conſidering on the other ſide that her maſter would preſentlie retourne, she went all weeping into the kitchen, where she found the child boiling in a pott of hott water ouer the fire, and thincking haſtely to draw it out, she took it by the arme, but the arme comming from the body, she tooke out all the reſt by morcels, and though she were extremely afflicted and as it were beſide her ſelfe, neuertheles enforcing her ſelfe she fitted all the pieces

together in a cheſt which ſhe ſhutt vp, and then thought of dreſsing the dinner, till her maſter and miſtreſſe came, to whome ſhe related all, ſhewing them the child. The mother, whiles the S. according to his cuſtome was in prayer, would haue fallen into extreme rage and lamentation but her husband of ſound faith, remembring that he had the S. with him, who he knew to haue great creditt with God: perſuaded his wife to pacifie her ſelfe till S. Francis had dined, telling her, that ſhe ſhould haue time enough to lament afterward, if the diuine mercy did not aſsiſt thē: that ſhe ſhould haue confidence in the S. and that ſhe ſhould ſee merueillous ſucceſſe. So with an extraordinary conſtancie perferring their loue to S. Francis before that to their child, not to diſcontent him, they ſuppreſſed and concealed their interiour greife, &amp; did eat with him with the greateſt ioy they could. Now att the end of dinner, the holy Father S. Francis demaunded of the gentleman if he had a couple of apples, wherof he would gladly eat: who anſweared that he had none preſent, but would ſoone gett thē. The S. replyed that he would not any ſhould goe out of the houſe for them, but willed that one ſhould looke in that cheſt, pointing att that wherin were aſſembled the mēbers of the dead child, and there ſhould be found two: the gentleman hearing the cheſt nominated &amp; knowing what was in it, was extremely agitated, &amp; repleniſhed with faith which God augmented in his hart, hoping that day to ſee ſome merueilles of the infinite bounty: he opened the cheſt where he found his ſonne a liue and very well, holding two faire aples in his two handes, which he ioyfully brought to S. F. as if he had bin in a cradle: it may be imagined what ioy the Parentes conceaued to ſee their child aliue: they were ſo ſurpriſed with this ioy, that being as it were beſide thē ſelues, they could not ſpeake a word. S. F. recounted vnto them how in his prayer offered, God reuealed vnto him the death of the child cauſed by the deuil: thē he exhorted thē thenceforward to haue cōfidence in his diuine maieſty, as they had formerlie had; becauſe faith wrought greater miracles then that, which being generally diuulged, cauſed many to lift their harts and handes to God. This hiſtory was painted in diuers places in memory of this great benefitt, and of the deuotion that many bare to the holy Father S. Francis,
               
               
                  Of an other child which God rayſed by the merittes of the holy Father S. Francis, and of diuers other miracles wrought.
                  THE XLIII. CHAPTER.
                  BEing att an other time lodged with a knight, as they diſcourſed of ſpirituall matters, there came a ſeruant all chafed and full of teares,

telling this gētleman his maſter that his ſonne was att that very houre drowned in a chanell: wheratt the Father and mother pittifully lamented. S. Francis was moued to cōpaſsion: and after that he had comforted thē willing thē to haue hope in God, he fell to prayer beſeeching his diuine Maieſty to reueale vnto him the place where he might finde the child. Now God hauing reuealed it vnto him, he bad the gentleman to ſend vnto ſuch a place where he ſhould finde his child, which being brought vtterly ſuffocated and drowned, he rayſed him an reſtored him to his Father in the name of God, with an infinite ioy to all the aſsiſtantesThe ants obey S. Francis. who rēdred thāckes inceſſātly vnto his diuine Maieſty. The holy Father S. Frācis minding to preach in a certaine place within the dioceſſe of Ciſterno, where a great nōber of people were aſſēbled to heare him, &amp; wā
                     ting cōueniēt place to preach vnto thē cōmodiously, by reaſō that it was a plaine, he approached to an oake which was frō the bottome to the toppe all couered with antes, which the holy Father hauing ſeene hecōmanded thē to goe frō that tree; and tourning to the people, he willed thē to giue way to the ſaid antes. And thē, which was admirable, they in nōber almoſt incredible, went that way which S. Francis had cauſed the people to make for them, ſo that they neuer retourned more, and this was cauſeWhy S. Francis loued not the antes. Matt. 6. of vnſpeakeable fruit. The holy Father S. Frācis of all other beaſtes had leaſt affectiō to thoſe antes, becauſe they employed ouer much dilligēce in hoarding their prouiſiō for the time to come. And withall he affirmed that they deſerued not to be nombred with the birdes of whome God ſaid: Behold the foules of the aire, that they ſow not, neither reape, nor gather into barnes: and your heauenly Father feedeth them. S. Francis would that all his Religious ſhould haue the ſame faith and reſignation of all their cogitations in his diuine prouidence, that God would ſhould be in his diſciples.
                  In the ſame place and time that the S. preached, there happened a fearfull miracle, for there came a woman with a cow-bell to diſturbe the company, wherwith ſhe made ſuch a ringing ſound, that one could not heare what he ſaid; S. Francis reprehending her, ſhe encreaſed it, ſuch poſſeſsion had the deuill of her. Vpon this occaſion, the holy FatherThe deuil viſibly 
                           •
                        aried away a woman for troubling a ſermon of S. Fr. inſpired of God and moued with zeale of his holy word, and of the conuerſion of ſoules, vttered theſe wordes: Carry her away Satan, carry her away, for ſhe is one of they members and is thine. O horrible and fearfull accident, theſe wordes being ended, the woman was incontinently carryed vp into the aire both body and ſoule in vew of all the world: for which cauſe euery one was ſtricken in extreme terrour and feare of the diuine maieſty, and thenceforward gaue eare to his holy worde in very great reuerence. S. Francis walking with his companion on the banckes of the riuer Po, and being ouertaken by the night

he was exceedingly perplexed to get lodgeing, by reaſon that the way was extreme foule and durty, the aire very darck, and the place not free frō theeues; for though they had nothing to looſe, yet ſhould they haue bin afflicted by them: wherefore his cōpanion ſaid vnto him: Father pray vnto God, if you pleaſe, that he may voutſafe to be our guide: and to deliuer vs frō this affliction. The S. no otherwiſe anſweared but: God is able if he pleaſe, and that it be for our good to deliuer vs, and remouing this darcknes to giue vs his light. Att this inſtant as he lifted vp his handes to heauen, a cleare light appeared, and ſo reſplendant that being in all other places a very darck night, they ſaw very clearly and perfectly, nor only how to goe in their way, but euery where about thē. So by this light guided and comforted both ſpiritually and corporally,God ſent a light to enligh ten S. Francis in a darck night. they made ſuch ſpeed as they arriued att their place of retire, ſinging prayſes and himnes vnto God, of whome S. Francis was aſsiſted in his neceſsity. He accuſtomed when he came to any place to preach, therby the more cōmodiously to aſſemble the people, to ſound a cornet which to that purpoſe he carryed with him with two ſtickes of a paulme long, which are to this day conſerued in his church of Aſsiſium, in the ſacriſtye, hauing the endes garniſhed with ſiluer: they are ſhewed with other reliques att all times when they are deſired to be ſeene.
                  Certaine doctrines and diſcourſe of the glorious Father S. Francis which haue bin found recorded.
               
               
                  Of the faith and reuerence due to the holy ſacrament.
                  THE XLIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe holie Father ſainct Francis, did not onlie ſeeke to edifie his neighbour in corporall preſence, and by example and preaching, but alſo ſuch as he could not aſsiſt by thoſe meanes being remote from them, he aſsiſted by letters and aduertiſſementes, which he cauſed his Religious to write, wherof I thought it requiſit to ſelect the choice and principall, to inſert in this place, ſpecified according to the contentes.
                  
                     A letter of the holy Father ſainct Francis to all the Religious of the generall chapter.

And therefore ſtriue to make it knowne to all people, that he alone is almighty in all thinges, perſeuer in his diſcipline and obſeruance, and maytaine that which you haue promiſed him with a firme reſolution, ſi

I beſeech all my brethren that are Preiſtes, and ſuch as in the name of God ſhalbe, when they intend to celebrate the diuine maſſe,Marc. 26 to be pure and neat, that they may worthelie offer the true ſacrifice of the moſt ſacred bodie and bloud of our lord IESEVS CHRIST, with the greateſt reuerence, puritie &amp; holie intētion that they ſhalbe able, not for any humane reſpect, for any feare or loue; but that their intention be directed to God, deſiring to pleaſe onlie his Maieſtie, who ſayth: Doe this in remembrance of me. Know then yee Preiſtes, that he who ſhall doe otherwiſe, ſhalbe like vnto Iudas. Remember the ſaying of the Apoſtle:

Iohn Baptiſt trembled, and durſt not touch the head of IESVS CHRIST: and finally if the holy ſepulchre, wherin IESVS CHRIST was buryed, for his ſo ſmall time of reſidence, is ſo much reuerenced; how much more ought he to be iuſt, holy, and well purged, who with his handes doth handle, and with his proper mouth doth receaue ſo high &amp; infinite a Maieſty, and doth adminiſter, the ſame to others? Remember that he is an immortall and eternall God, that liueth glorious and eternall; with contemplation of whoſe Maieſty the Angels themſelues cannot be ſatisfied. Preiſtes know your dignitie,1. Pet. 1. and be holy, for God is holy, and as in regard of ſo great a myſtery and dignity you haue bin more honoured then other men; remember in like ſort to be alſo more gratefull vnto God, and to reuerence, loue and honour him; for otherwiſe your miſery is exceeding great, and deſerueth continuall teares, in that you hauing in your handes the almighty God, the fountaine of all good thinges, you procure to haue tranſitory and terreſtriall thinges, all the world ought to tremble with feare, and ſweetly weepe, whiles the Angels themſelues bend their knees, when IESVS CHRIST the Sonne of the moſt high is vpon the altare, betweene the handes of man.

                  THE XLV. CHAPTER.
                  TO all Chriſtians Religious, Eccleſiaſticall, lay men and women that are in the world: Brother Francis their ſeruant and ſubiect in God, deſireth withall reuerence a true peace in heauē, by the ſincere charity which is diſcended on earth. As I am the ſeruant of you all, ſo am I obliged to ſerue all, and to adminiſter vnto you the moſt ſweet word of my lord and Sauiour IESVS CHRIST: Conſidering therfore in my ſoule that by reaſon of the diuers infirmities that afflict my body I cannot by corporall preſence as I deſire, viſitt you my ſelfe: I haue thought good to ſupply the ſame by letters, and by them to adminiſter vnto you the worde of IESVS CHRIST, who is the word of the eternall Father, &amp; the wordes of the holy Ghoſt, which are ſpiritt &amp; life.Of the dignity of the B. Sacrament of the altar &amp; how on ought to reuerence it. Ioan. 6. I then admoniſh you Brethren, to confeſſe your ſinnes to a Preiſt, with all the dilligence you can poſsible, and att his hand to receaue the true body and bloud of IESVS CHRIST. For as our Lord ſaith: he that eateth not my fleſh, and drincketh not my bloud cannot haue eternall life. Lett vs then endeauour worthely to receaue ſuch &amp; ſo eminent a maieſty: for he that receaueth it vnworthely, in ſteed of ſaluatiō pourchaceth death. Beſides I exhort you often to viſitt the holy churches, and to reuerence Preiſtes, not ſo much in reſpect of themſelues if they be ſinners, as for reuerence of the function and dignity which they haue in being miniſters of the moſt pretious body and bloud of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, which by them is offered on the altare, receaued, and adminiſtred vnto vs, without which none can be ſaued: by the holy wordes which they vtter, and miniſter, he diſcendeth from heauen to earth, andMat. 22. Luc. 10. none but they can doe it. O how happy and bleſſed are they who loue God withall their hart, with all their ſoules, and with all their forces, and their neighbour as themſelues? I inuite you all my brethren, and you my ſiſters, to this loue: lett vs all with one accord loue God, &amp; with one pure affection of our hart adore him, becauſe that is the thing which heLuc. 4. eſpecially requireth and demaundeth of vs, as himſelfe hath ſaid: the true adorers adore in ſpiritt and truth; and it is neceſſary for them that adoreIoan. 14. him, to doe it in that manner. Our lord ſaid to his diſciples: I am the way &amp; the verity, &amp; the life. No man cōmeth to the Father but by me. If you had knowne me, my Father alſo certes you had knowen: &amp; from hencefoorth you ſhall know him, and you haue ſeen him. Phillip ſaid to him Lord ſhew vs the Father, &amp; it ſufficeth vs. IESVS ſaid to him, So long

time I am with you: and haue you not knowē me? Phillip, he that ſeeth me, ſeeth the Father alſo. The Father dwelleth in a light inacceſsible, &amp;Ioan. 1. God is a ſpiritt, whome no man hath euer ſeene, becauſe he is a ſpiritt and therfore, inuiſible, but in ſpiritt, conſidering that he is a ſpiritt moſt pure, for it is the ſpiritt that giueth life, and the fleſh can doe nothinge. He may alſo be ſeene of euery true Chriſtian, in the Sonne, in that ſubſtanceIoan. 6. which is equall to the Father, and therfore all they that ſee our Lord IESVS CHRIST, according to the humanity, and not according to his diuinity, are condemned, as likewiſe are they who ſee the ſacrament which is conſecrated by the wordes of our Lord, on the altare, by the handes of the Preiſt, vnder the formes of bread and wine, and doe not ſee him and beleeue in their ſpiritt, that it is the true and moſt ſacred body and bloud of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, are condemned, the ſouueraine Lord giueth his teſtimony againſt them when he ſaid: This is my body and this is my bloud of the new teſtament,Mat. 26. Marc. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 6. which ſhalbe ſhed for you, and for many in remiſsion of ſinnes. He ſaith in an other place: He that eateth my fleſh and drincketh my bloud ſhall haue life euerlaſting. He that hath the ſpiritt of God, which dwelleth in his faithfull, he receaueth the moſt ſacred bloud and body of IESVS CHRIST: and all other that haue not the ſame ſpiritt, yet neuertheles preſume to receaue it, they eat and drinck their iudgement and damnation: therefore, yee children of men how long will you be ſenceleſſe, and haue your hartes ſo hardened? When will you compaſſe to know the truth, and to beleeue in the Sonne of God? who ſo humbly ſeeketh you euery day, as when he diſcended from his imperiall throne into the virginall wombe, he ordinarily commeth euery day vnto vs, in ſuch humble manner attired and ſo approachable? He euery day deſcendeth from the boſome of his Father into the handes of the Preiſt on the altare, and as he was knowne vnto the holy Apoſtles in true fleſh, in that very manner doth he communicate himſelfe vnto vs in the holy Sacrament. And as they with their corporall eyes ſaw nothing but flesh, yet with their ſpirituall eyes, they knew him to be God: euen ſo we with our corporall eyes, ſeeing the accidentes of bread and wine, ought to ſee and firmely to beleeue, that there is the moſt ſacred body and true bloud of our Lord IESVS CHRIST on the altare. In thisMat. 2

                  Of lone towards our neighbour, and how much the body is to be hated.
                  THE XLVI. CHAPTER.
                  THis thinge may doubtles much confound vs, that making profeſsion to be ſeruantes of IESVS CHRIST, and being certaine that his true freindes haue done may worckes that haue bin entirely deuout, vertuous and holy, we neuertheles content our ſelues with the only relation of them, and eſteeme by the bare diſcourſe therof without execution, to raigne eternally. Bleſſed is the ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST that loueth his Chriſtian brother as much being ſick as in health, and in aduerſitie as in proſperity. Bleſſed is he that loueth and honoureth his Brother both farre and neere, that ſpeaketh nothing in his abſence, but what with great charity he may ſay in his preſence.Matt. 5. God ſaid in the Goſpell: loue your ennemies and pray for them that hate and iniury you: He loueth his ennemie truely, that complaineth not of the iniuries which he hath receaued &amp; doth receaue of him, but of the ſinnes which himſelfe hath cōmitted, and doth cōmitt againſt God and his ſoule, and alſo he that is not content to haue the loue of God in himſelfe, if he doe not alſo make demonſtration therof by the ſame worckes vnto his neighbour, and much more vnto his ennemy. Bleſſed are the poore in ſpiritt, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen. There are many that endure diuers afflictions in their bodyes, in prayer and good worckes, and that mortifie it with abſtinence, and neuertheles for a slight word ſpoaken againſt their liking, or for hauing ſomething denyed them, they are incontinentlie ſcandalized and troubled. Such are not poore in ſpirit, though exteriourly they appeare ſo: for the true poore in ſpirit, miſpriſe and abhorre themſelues, and loue not only thoſe that afflict and iniury them, but euen thoſe that beat them. Bleſſed alſo is he that ſupporteth the infirmity and fragility of his neighbour, as he would be glad to haue his owne ſupported: My faithfull, lett vs loue our neighbour as our ſelues: and they who ſee they cannot loue them as themſelues, lett them loue them as much as they can, or att leaſt lett them not offend them. Lett vs hate and deteſt our peruerſeMatt. 15. willes: for as God ſaith, of our hart proceedeth all euils: this is to be vnderſtood of him that applieth his hart, to ſatisfie his ſenſualities. Many when they ſinne or receaue any iniury, accuſe their neighbour therof, which they ſhould not doe: for each one hath his ennemies, which is the body, with the ſences therof, by which he offendeth. Therfore bleſſed is the ſeruant that hath ſuch an ennemie in ſubiection, and ſo keepeth it vnder, and watcheth it with ſuch prudence

that he hath no cauſe to feare it: for whiles he vſeth this dilligence, no other ennemy viſible or inuiſible can annoy him, nor procure him to ſinne, in ſuch ſort that as S. Iohn Chryſoſtome ſaith: no man is hurt but of himſelfe. We hate our body in as much as it will committ ſinne: for liuing carnally, it ſeeketh to deſtroy the loue of God, together with the glory of Paradiſe, condemning it ſelfe and the ſoule perpetually to to hell; the greateſt ennemy therfore that a man hath, is his proper fleſh, which can thinck of nothing but that which offendeth it, nor feare ought in foreſight of that which is eternally to befall it, the humour and deſire therof is only to abuſe temporall thinges: and the worſt is, it vſurpeth to it ſelfe all contentment, and glory, euen of that which is graunted to the ſoule, not to it, for it ſeeketh the honour of vertues, of prayers, watchinges, and temporall fauour, it will haue applauſe of teares, in fine it leaueth nothing to the ſoule that apperteineth to her.
               
               
                  Of obedience.
                  THE XLVII. CHAPTER.
                  
                     Gen. 2. GOd ſaid to Adam: Of euery tree of Paradiſe eat thou: But of the tree of knowledge of good and euill eat thou not: and whiles he obeyed God he offended not. But hauing tranſgreſſed this commandement, he was condemned of God for euer, till he was redeemed by the grace of his Sonne. That man doth eate of the forbidden apple of knowledge of good and euill, who appropriateth to himſelfe, his owne will, and with his benefittes which God vttereth and worketh by him, doth exalte himſelfe; therfore was he neceſſarily obliged to puniſhment. God ſaith in the goſpell: he that loueth his life, ſhall loſeIoan. 12. Luc. 14. it: and in an other place, he that doth not renounce all that he poſſeſſeth, cannot be my diſciple. He renounceth all that he poſſeſſeth, and looſeth his ſoule, for the loue of God, who in euery thing ſubmitteth himſelfe to his Prelate: for by this meane, he may be tearmed truely obedient, and then alſo knowing he could doe ſome other thing better then that which he is commanded, and of more profitt to his ſoule, he ſacrificeth his will vnto God; employing himſelfe in that which he is commanded for the loue of God, though it be of leſſe fruit: for true obedience, is full of charity, edifieth our neighbour, and entierly ſatisfieth God. But if the Superiour ſhould command him any thinge in preiudice of his ſoule, then only he ought not to obey, but this caſe excepted, in althinges elſe, he muſt hold him his true Superiour: and if that other Religious perſecute and afflict him, becauſe he obeyeth his Superiour; happy ſhall he be, for he may then truely ſay that God hath communicated vnto him his

perfect charity, which conſiſteth in enduring perſecutions, and expoſing his owne life for his neighbour. But the miſery is, there are certaine Religious who whiles they would conſider, and know whither certaine thinges by them inuented, be not better then thoſe which the Superiours commaund them, the wretches doe not conſider that they looke back, and retourne to the vomitt of their ſelfe-will; and ſo doe they ruine themſelues and their neigbour by their euill example.
               
               
                  Of patience and humilitie.
                  THE XLVIII. CHAPTER▪
                  
                  THough there be nothing that ought, more to diſpleaſe the true ſeruant of God then ſinne, neuertheles if he fall into ouermuch paſsion, for any ſinne whatſoeuer, his charity towardes his neighbour excepted, he is guiltie of that ſinne. Therfore the ſeruant of God which is not moued in ſuch accidentes, may be truely ſaid to be without paſsion; for his patience

                     cannot be knowen while alt

                     inges ſmiles vpon him, and ſucced according to his wiſh: But when occaſion is preſented wherin he deſireth to be ſatisfied, and the contrary arriueth, then is his patience experienced, for he hath as much as he then ſheweth, and no more▪ The holy Father S. Francis would ſay, that they were truely peaceable, who ſuffering in this world for the loue of God, conſerue peace in their interiour, and liue as Lambes among woulues. In which reſpect God himſelfe liued and dyed ſo. Happy is he that being reprehended and accuſed of others, receaueth and beareth ſuch reprehenſion charitably and patiently as of himſelfe, and without excuſiue reply, conſenteth with ſhame, confeſſeth with patience, and performeth due ſatisfaction couragiously, yea euen in matters wherof he is guiltles, and being a ſubiect, perſiſteth vnder the rule of diſcipline, or being ſuperiour, conuerſeth with his ſubiectes as with▪ his ſuperiours. Happy is the ſeruant that incontinently correcteth and chaſticeth his offences, interiourly by contrition, and exteriourly by confeſsion and ſatisfaction.
                  
                     A diſcourſe which the holy Father S. Francis made to Brother Leo his companion, being in ſeruour of ſpirit.
                     BRother Leo my beloued ſonne, note well theſe my wordes: Albeit the Frere Minors in whatſoeuer place they be, giue example of edification and ſanctity, neuertheles conſider prudently &amp; ſeriously obſerue that their perfect ioy conſiſteth not in that. Yea if they

ſhould reſtore ſight to the blind, health to the ſicke, hearing to the deafe, ſpeech to the dumbe, ability of goeing to the lame, ſhould expell diuels out of bodies, and rayſe the dead that had ſauoured four dayes, their true alacrity conſiſteth not in all this. If they ſhould vnderſtand all the ſcriptures, could ſpeake all tongues, ſhould propheſie and know the conſciences of men, yet doth their true ioy leſſe conſiſt in this. Had they intelligence to diſcourſe of celeſtiall vertues, with the very tongues of Angels, as alſo of the courſe of the ſtarres, of the proprieties of plantes and ſtones, were all the treaſures of the world diſcouered vnto them, knew they the nature and vertue of fiſhes and other beaſtes, and alſo of men, their true ioy dependeth not theron. Though they ſhould preach with ſuch feruour as to conuert all the Infidels to the faith of IESVS CHRIST, neither doth their true ioy conſiſt in that. Brother Leo to all this anſweared: Wherin then conſiſteth it. S. Francis replied: Heare me Brother Leo: If we comming to our Lady of Angels by meane of a long iorny, very weary, wett with the raine, frozen with cold, dabled with durt, and extremely hungry, ringing att the gate, the porter vtterly diſquieted and in coller ſhould aske vs, who we were, and hauing anſweared him that we were Frere Minors and therefore

And if being conſtrained by neceſsity, we continued ringing to enter, the porter ſhould come forth in great choler againſt vs, and vſe vs indiſcreetlie and importunately, 
                           •
                        aying vnto vs: Get ye gone to the hoſpitall lewd and impudent fellowes as ye are, and ſtay no longer here for you ſhall not enter; if we ſupport all this with alacritie, and pardon him with all our hart, therin conſiſteth perfect ioy. And being full darck night we being euery way moleſted, ſhould begin againe to ring and knock, &amp; weeping bitterlie ſhould pray the porter to lett vs in for the loue of God, yet he more cruell then before ſhould come out with a good cudgell and load vs ſoundly with iniuries and baſtinadoes, leauing vs in the durt rather dead then aliue: write, Brother Leo, that therin would conſiſt perfect ioy: prouided that we ſupport it all with great patience, that we pray God to pardō him, and that we loue him more, then if he had opened the dore vnto vs for the loue of God, who hath endured much more for all vs.
                     
                        
Heare now the concluſion of all the graces of the holy Ghoſt which IESVS CHRIST hath graunted, doth, and euer will graunt to his elect▪ The principall is that a man doe conquere himſelfe, and for his loue doe voluntarily ſupporte all kinde of iniuries and blowes euen to death: becauſe indeed we cannot truely glory of any of the other foreſaid vertues and graces, by reaſon that they are not ours, as the Apoſtle ſaith, but1. Cor. 14 Worthy aduertiſment to Superiours of the Frere Minors. Mat. 20. Luc. 21. Gal. 6. Goddes: What haſt thou that thou haſt not receaued? and if thou haſt receaued, why doeſt thou glory as if thou haſt not receaued? wherefore we neither can nor ought the glory, but in the croſſe of tribulations and afflictions, which is our owne: therfore the Apoſtle ſaith: I will glory only in the croſſe of our Lord IESVS CHRIST: by which wordes is ſufficientlie explicated the ſentence of God when he ſaid: In your patience you ſhall poſſeſſe your ſoules. Our Lord God the ſoueraigne Prelat ſaid: I come not to be ſerued but to ſerue: And therfore ſuch as are conſtituted ouer others, ought to glory of ſuch Prelature, as if they were conſtituted to waſh the feet of the Religious. And when they are depriued their chardge, they ought no more to be greiued, then if were taken from them ſaid office of waſhing the of feet: ſuch as doe otherwiſe doe really appropriat to thēſelues this dignityin very imminent peril of their ſoules. That ſeruant of God then is happy, who eſteemeth himſelfe neither greater nor better, for being honoured of men, yea no otherwiſe then if he were reputed amonge the moſt baſe and abiect; for ſo great, as he is before God; ſuch is he, and no more. Wretched is the Religious who being rayſed to dignity by an other, will not humble himſelfe of his owne accord and of his owne will, happy is he that is exalted againſt his will, and not hauing procured it, and doth neuertheles deſire to remayne alwayes in lowe eſtate and vnder the feet of his ſubiectes for the loue of God. Happy is he that is no more puffed in pride for the good which God doeth or ſpeaketh by him, then of that which he doeth or ſpeaketh by others. A man offendeth att all times and as often as he procureth to haue more of that which is his neighbours, thē to giue to God of what is his owne. We ſhould neuer deſire to be ſuperiours and ouer others: but to be ſubiectes and ſeruanees of all creatures for the loue of God: and they who ſhall doe ſo, may aſſure themſelues, that if they perſeuer to the end, the ſpiritt of God will reſt vpon them, and there will make his reſidence. Ye men, conſider in what excellencie you haue ben created of God, who hath created and framed you after his owne image according to the ſoule and after th'image of his Sōne according to the body, and yet all creatures are much more obedient vnto him then your ſelues. The deuils haue not crucified him, which thou being induced by them haſt done, and dailie doeſt crucifie him by thy ſinnes. Wherein then canſt thou glory? miſerable that thou art, if thou were indued

with all knide of ſcience celeſtiall &amp; terreſtriall: the deuill hath knowne what appertaineth to heauen better then thou, and now though againſt his will, he knoweth more of earthly matters then all mankind together. There is no health, corporall diſpoſition, nor beautie, comparable to that which the deuill had: Take heed therfore, leaſt in abuſing it, as he did, not acknowledging it to proceed of God but of himſelfe, thou fall as he hath done into the extremeſt depth of hell. Happy is the ſeruant that treaſureth vp, the richeſſe his Lo
                           •
                        d and maſter hath giuen him, in heauen, and expecting the recompence therof, regardeth not to demonſtrate them heere vnto men, but leaueth the cogitation therof to God himſelfe, who when it ſhall pleaſe him will manifeſt it more then he would deſire. Happy then is he, that keepeth and concealeth the ſecrettes of God in his hart.
                  
               
               
                  How Religious ought to behaue themſelues in Oratories and ſolitary places.
                  THE XLIX. CHAPTER.
                  LEtt thoſe that deſire to reſide in ſolitary places, there to liue religiously and ſpiritually, be in number foure or more, wherof lett two be as mothers that haue two children, lett two act the Life of Martha, and the others of Magdalen, and lett each one haue a celle, ſo that they neither sleep nor conuerſe together but when they read their office. Lett them be carefull to ſay their Compline before the Sunne ſetting, that thence forward they may keep ſilence, till they ariſe in the night to ſay Mattins. Lett them in all thinges firſt ſeeke the glory and the kingdome of God, and his iuſtice: Lett them ſay the PrimeMatt. 6. and Tierce att the ordinary houre, which done they may ſpeake each to other of ſome matter of edification. Thoſe ſaid children as poore creatures ſhall demaund almoſe of their mother for the loue of God: after that lett them ſay the Sixt, Ninth, and Euenſong att their due houres: lett them permitt no perſon to enter into the Cloyſter or encloſure where they reſide, nor to eat there. The mothers ſhall labour to liue alſo ſequeſtred from all conuerſation, and with due obſeruance of obedience to their Guardian, lett them permitt none to ſpeake to their children, but their Guardian when he commeth to viſitt them. And lett the children ſometimes for exerciſe of humilitie aſſume the office of Mothers according as the Guardian for their behoofe ſhall appoint, that ſo they may experience both the one and the other office. Happy is that ſeruant who hath no taſt of any other thing then the word of his God, and by the ſame doth excite others to loue

him. Miſerable is that Religious that taketh pleaſure in idle and vaine wordes, for therbie enducing other to vanitie in imitation of himſelfe, in ſteed of edifiyng his neighbour, he procureth his ruine.
               
               
                  Of the care which each one ought to haue of his owne ſaluation.
                  THE L. CHAPTER.
                  BRother I haue a ſecrett to open vnto thee. Each of you well knoweth, that we are the ſonnes of the moſt high; but I now aduertiſe thee that more then children, we are alſo Spouſes, brothers and mothers of IESVS CHRIST. Spouſes when our ſoule by the vertue of the holie Ghoſt is vnited with God: Brothers, when we performe his will: we are Mothers when by loue we beare him in our hart, with a pure and ſincere conſcience: for we afterward bring him forth, both by the pious worckes which we performe, and by the example which we giue our neighbour. O my brethren, it is a glorious, admirable, and deſireable thing to haue ſuch a Spouſe, Brother, &amp; Sonne in heauen: And more then that, a Paſtour who hath giuen his ſoule here on earth for vs his ſheep, and who continually prayeth the eternall Father for vs,Ioan. 17. ſaying: Holy Father, keep them in thy name, whome thou haſt giuen me, that they may be thine, and may be with me where I ſhalbe, that they may enioy my glorie and ſplendour in my kingdome. All they who liue not in penance, not being contrite, nor receaue not the ſacred Sacrament, but liue in vices and ſinnes, and conceaue complacence in their pernicious deſires, doe not performe vnto God what they haue promiſed: but doe ſerue the world with their bodies in carnalities, and the deuils with their ſoules, being deluded in their contentment by him whoſe children they are; Such people I ſay are blinded, and depriued of the true light of IESVS CHRIST, &amp; haue not true knowledge: for they haue excluded from themſelues the wiſdome of the eternall Father IESVS CHRIST the ſoueraine verity, &amp; though they ſeeme to ſee, know, &amp; vnderſtand, yet doe they neither ſee, know, nor vnderſtand: for they doe voluntarie blinde and ruinate their owne ſoules. Open your eyes, then, blinded &amp; deluded as ye are by your ennemies, the fleſh, the world,Matt. 15. and the deuill. To the body it is a very delightfull thing to ſerue ſinne, &amp; very tedious to ſerue God: all euils and ſinnes proceed from the hart of mā, as God ſaith in the Goſpell. The wicked haue no good in this world, nor ſhall haue in the next, they ſeeme att their pleaſure to poſſeſſe the preſent vanities, but they are deceaued: for the time and houre will come, when they ſhall looſe all.
                  The holy Father ſaid alſo that one being knowne to be verie ſicke

the firſt aduertiſement of his kinred and freindes, is not to prouide for his ſoule, but to make his will, and ſo his wife, kinred and freindes gatherHow we ought to prepare our ſelues to dye. about him, to induce him to be mindfull of them: And he ouercome by the teares of his wife, the tender loue he beareth to his children and the perſuaſions of his kinred that ſeeme to haue forgotten his ſoule, diſpoſeth of his ſubſtance according to their fancie to giue them contēt, and ſaith that he committeth to their gouernment and authority his ſubſtance, his ſoule and his body: that man is truely accurſed who in this ſort putteth his truſt in man: conformable to what the Prophett Ieremie ſaid: Curſed is the man that truſteth in man. Now after ſuch diſpoſitionIere. 17. the Confeſſour is ſent for, who finding the wretch obliged to ſome reſtitution, ſoliciteth him to diſcharge himſelfe therof, but he anſweareth that he hath made his teſtament, diſpoſed of all his goodes, and deliuered it into the handes of his heires, who will ſatisfie whatſoeuer ſhalbe neceſſary, and becauſe he is in agonie and hath almoſt loſt his ſpeech, there is no time to diſpoſe of matters neceſſarie to the diſcharge of his conſcience, and ſo he dyeth a moſt miſerable death. Therfore lett euerie one know, that when and howſoeuer a man dye in mortall ſinne, and without due reſtitution of an other mannes goodes, hauing power to doe it before his death, the deuill carryeth his ſoule directlie to hell, where he ſhalbe eternallie tormented, and ſo in an inſtant he looſeth bodie and ſoule, goodes and honour; becauſe his kinred diuiding his inheritance among them▪ they often curſe his ſoule, for not hauing left to one of them, what he hath left to all.
               
               
                  Of the contrarietie of vices and vertues, and certaine breife aduertiſements and exerciſes of them.
                  THE LI. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Francis affirmed, that where true charity is, there can neither be feare nor ignorance; Where there is a ioyfull and voluntarie pouerty there is neither enuy nor auarice; where there is Meditation of God, there is no care: where the feare of God is keeper of the houſe, there the deuill cannot enter; where there is diſcretion and mercy, there is neither ſuperfluity nor deceipt. Now I tell you there is no man in the world can in any ſort haue one of the ſaid vertues, If he doe not firſt die to himſelfe, and he that reallie poſſeſſeth one hath all: with that one, he erreth not in the reſt, and he that erreth in one, erreth in all the other, and is in that caſe as if he had not any; they are of ſuch valew, that each one of

it ſelfe confoundeth vices and ſinnes: holie wiſdome confoundeth the deuill with all his malices: holy ſimplicitie confoundeth the prudence of the deuill, the world, and the flesh: holy pouertie confoundeth enuie, auarice, and ſeculer deſires: holy humilitie confoundeth pride, with all worldly honoures, and what ſoeuer is in them: holy charity confoundeth all diabolicall and carnall temptations and pleaſures: holy obedience confoundeth all naturall will and ſenſuall affection, ſubiecteth the body to obedience of the ſpiritt, rendreth and maketh a man humble and ſubiect, not only to all men, but euen to other irreaſonable1. Cor. 3. creatures. The Apoſtle ſaith: the letter killeth but the ſpiritt giueth life: they are killed by the letter, who ſeeke to know only, to be reputed learned and wiſe of the world: by this meane to purchaſe honours and richeſſe, with anxiety to aduance their kinred and freindes: and in a word, not for themſelues, but for the body or for others. And they are quickened of the ſpiritt, who referre all the learning and knowledge they haue, and deſire to haue, only to the prayſe and honour of the diuine maieſty, and who appeare before God, by the example of their life, and with wordes full of edification, offring vnto him that goodnes which is entierlie his owne. In this ſort it is, that the ſeruant of God may know if he really haue his ſpiritt: for if the fleſh glorie in the worckes it doeth, by meane of the grace of God as its owne, it is then a ſigne that he is of the deuill: But if in the ſaid worckes, he neuertheleſſe repute himſelfe vile, and acknowledge himſelfe a moſt greiuous ſinner, he is then truely of God, and God is in him: Happy is the ſeruant that neither ſpeaketh nor doeth any thinge, for hope of recompence in this world, but for the loue of God, nor lightlie ſpeaketh, what commeth to his mouth, but prudently and in due time, diſpoſeth his propoſitions and anſweares. Wretched alſo is the Religious that buryeth in his hart the graces which he receaueth of God, or that commanicateth them for ſubiect of vaine glorie, deſiring rather to manifeſt them verballie then to God; for he hath alreadie receaued his reward, and they who haue heard him, haue bin litle edified therby. Theſe are wordes of life, and he that ſhall ruminate and accompliſh them, ſhall finde true life, and in the end obtaine ſaluation of God. They that ſeeke not to taſt how ſweete God is, and that loue darcknes more then light, neglecting to obſerue thePſal. 118. commandementes of God, are by his Prophett accurſed of him, who ſayeth: Curſed are they who erre from thy commandementes: but how bleſſed and happie are they that loue God, and performe the ſaying of the goſpell: Thou ſhalt loue thy Lord thyMat. 22. God, with all thy hart, with all thy ſoule, and withall thy will: Lett vs therefore, My Brethren, loue and prayſe God day and

night: Our Father which art in heauen, becauſe it is neceſſary to pray alwayes, without intermiſsion: and lett vs haue charity and humility,Luc. 18. and doe almoſe deedes, that they may cleanſe our ſoules from ſpottes of ſinne, for euerie thing appertayning to the world tourneth to ruine, men muſt leaue it, and carry with them onlie the recompence and reward of charitie and the almoſe they haue done, wherof they ſhall receaue recompence of God: And therfore it is good to faſt from vices and ſinnes, flying all occaſions of them, and to keepe vs from all kinde of ſuperfluitie, though lawfull, and we muſt frequent churches, and honour Preiſtes, in reſpect of the dignity they haue with God: and eſpeciallie the Religious that haue renounced the world, to doe more good then others, and by their example we alſo muſt renounce it, if not entierlie, att leaſt in part. Lett vs loue our ennemies, and doe good to them that hate vs: lett vs obſerue the preceptes and counſailes of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, renouncing our ſelues, and liuing vnder the ſweet yoke of his obedience. Lett vs not be wiſe according to the fleſh, but ſimple, humble, and pure, keeping our ſences mortified, and pride trodden vnder foot, conſidering our baſenes vnworthie to be ſuperiour to others as they would we ſhould be. Lett vs imitate our Lord, and carry his croſſe vpon vs, lett vs ſuffer together with him, who hath endured ſo much for vs wretches in this world, and beſtoweth on vs ſo many benefittes, and far greater will hereafter, and to whome all creatures ought to giue prayſe, honour, and glorie in heauen, in earth, in the ſea, and in the depth, becauſe he is our vertue and our force, who only is good, only moſt high, onlie almighty, meruaylous and glorious, and only holy, prayſed and exalted for euer Amen. I Brother Francis your ſeruant with the greateſt humilitie I can, proſtrate on the earth and kiſsing your feet, doe beſeech you by the bowels of the charitie of God, to receaue theſe wordes and others of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, to effect and obſerue them with due humilitie and charitie, aſſuring all them, that ſhall receaue, vnderſtand, and effect them, and ſhall by wordes and example teach them to others, therein perſeuering to the end, that the Father, the Sonne, and holie Ghoſt, will giue him his benediction. Amen.

                     S. Franc. obtayned raine by prayers. THere happening an extreme drineſſe att Beneuentum for want of rayne, and wheras euery one expected and feared a great dearth, the holy Father S. Francis arryued there, and hauing preached and being enformed of their affliction, he commaunded each one to ſay a Pater noſtex and Aue Maria: which done, it rained very abondantlie. Preaching an other time in a church, neere vnto a pond where were manie frogges, which by their croakinges hindredThe frogges obey him. the people from hearing him: the holie Father commaunded them to be ſilent, and they in ſuch ſort obeyed him that retourning thither an other time, and knowing that they had not croaked from

the time of the ſaid prohibition, he gaue them licence to vſe their naturall voice, which att the verie inſtant they began to doe. There being a generall proceſsion made in a place called Arona, for an extreme drineſſe which they endured; ſainct Francis comming thither, began to preach vnto them publikelie in the middes of a feildSwallowes couers the hearers of his ſermon. in the violent ſcorching ſunne, whither (to the end he and his audience might not be moleſted) our lord ſent ſuch a number of ſwallowes, that remayning in the middes of the aire, they couered the multitude from the beames of the ſunne, and ſtirred not thence till ſainct Francis had ended his predication. Preaching att Albruzo in a church of the Virgin Marie, to excite the people more ſeriouslie to obſerue the word of God, there being preſented vnto him a child that was crooked, lame and mute, called AlbertusHe cureth a crooked lame &amp; mute child. Campoly, he with his verie handes ſtreightned his crookedneſſe and his other maymed members, which obeyed him as if they had conſiſted of ſoft waxe, and compoſed euerie part aacording to their nature: then calling him, he made him anſweare, and of that anſweare followed his ſpeech, ſo that he deliuered him perfectlie cured vnto his Father, who with verie great faith expected the ſucceſſe, wherevpon he with all the people were inflamed in the true loue of God, and yelded infinite thanckes to his diuine Maieſtie. He cured a dangerous wound in a yong man by the ſigne of the croſſe in the cittie of Caſtello, whither he was brought with great faith,A mortal wound. that he might ſigne him with the ſaid ſigne, ſo that the next morming, the fleſh being growen where before it was putrified, the cicatrice remayned vermillion like a roſe, in perpetuall memorie of the miracle. When the Monaſterie was builded for his Religious attHe conuerted water into wine. Ancona, the worckmen wanting wine they murmured, and would no longer labour: but ſainct Francis hauing made his prayer, went to a neighbour fountaine, the water wherof, by the ſigne of the croſſe which he made thereon, he tourned into wine, then made the labourers to drincke, whome he made penitent of their conceaued impatience. A gentleman viſiting the holie Father in the Church of ſainct Chriſtopher att Iterrena, and hauing inuited him to eatHe alſo conuerteth vinegar into wine. with him, it happened that there was no wine in his houſe, ſainct Francis then commanded a botell of vinegar to be drawne, and it was ſeene and knowne to be moſt precious wine. In the ſame cittie, a wall being fallen vpon a yong man, that was found dead vnder the ſtones, whiles he was lamented in his Fathers houſe, ſainct Francis hauing compaſsion therof and inſpired of God,He raiſeth one dead. entred in att a back dore, and approching to the beare that was vncouered; (for in Italy the body is carryed to buried clothed as

Prelates are here) he tooke the dead by the arme, and calling him by his name, he raiſed him, no otherwiſe then if he had awaked▪ him from sleep, and att the verie inſtant he propheſied that he ſhould liue and haue no children by his wife, which came ſo to paſſe, and all this was aſſured to Pope Nicolas the third by autenticall teſtimonie that was produced before notaries.

                  THE LIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe glorious S. after he was conuerted to God neuer remayned idle: for he alwayes endeauoured to be employed in ſome action, in example of Iacobs ladder, wher on the Angels ceaſſed not to mount and diſcend, receauing and carrying the pious worckes of the children of God to the ſoueraigne Father: ſo the S. by contemplation mounted towardes God, and by pietie and preaching diſcended to his neighbour: thus did he employ all his time which had bin giuen him of his diuine Maieſtie to meritt in the pious worckes which the holie Ghoſt did dictat vnto him. Now the time of one of his lentes being come wherin as a carefull bee, he collected the fruites and flowers of God by meane of prayer, therof to compound the delicious honie of predications, wherwith he might refectionat the hungrie chidren of the word of God, he reſolued to ſeeke out a place where he might performe the ſame commodiouslie, ſolitarie and without any impedimēt; to this purpoſe on Shrouetueſday he wēt vp to the lake of Peruſia where a freind of his, lodged him on the ſide of the lake, whence the next morning he gott himſelfe to be conducted in a barcke to the Iland that is ſcituat on the ſaid lake then vnhabited, with two litle loaues to ſuſtaine him during the ſaid lent, he coniured his freind not to ſpeake therof to any perſon, for ſo much as he would not therin truſt any of his Religious not hauing for that time taken any companion, and enioyned his ſaid freind not to come for him till Maundie or holie thurſday. Being then diſcended into this Ile, himſelfe made a litle cottageS. Franc. did eat but halfe a loafe in the whole lent. of bowes of trees, where he reſided all the lent in continuall and holie contemplation and conuerſation with God, the Angels, and bleſſed Saintes. On holie thurſday his freind comming earlie vnto him reconducted him to the Couent, where he would communicate with all his diſciples and waſh their feet: he reſtored a loafe and halfe to his freind, of the two which he had giuen him, the other halfe it is credible he did eat to obſerue humane faſt, or not to giue ſubiect of vaine glorie to

the deuill, and not to equall himſelfe to his God, though God alone doth know, and his ſeruant ſainct Francis, who would neuer reueale it to any man, the combates he had during that lent, againſt the inuiſible ennemies, &amp; the glorious graces he obtayned; Afterward God voutſafed in ſome ſort to reueale them, worcking in that place manie miracles, by the merittes of the Sainct, whervpon the ile began to be inhabited, and there was erected a Couent of Frere Minors which is exceedingly reuerenced in memory of the ſaid miracle.
               
               
                  Of the lent of S. Michael which he kept on the Mount Aluerne.
                  THE LIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe yeare of grace 224. two yeares before the death of this glorious Father, ſome dayes before the natiuitie of the Virgin Marie, he repayred to the Oratorie of Mount Aluerne, there to keep his lent that began the day after the ſaid feaſt of the Virgin Marie, &amp; continued til the feaſt of S. Michael the Archāgel, according to his perticuler deuotion, where he ſhutt himſelfe into a celle, ſequeſtred from all others. The firſt euening that he entred there, he demaunded this grace of God, that he would pleaſe to reueale vnto him in what he ſhould ſerue him that lent, as he accuſtomed to doe, for he gouerned him in althinges according to the will of God, and not according to his owne. Now in the morning about the breake of day S. Francis aryſing from prayer, there incontinentlie flocked a great number of birdes that began to ſing one after an other and hauing ſung, they tooke their flight and left the Sainct contented: In that inſtant he heard a voice that ſaid: Francis, let this be a ſigne of a notable fauour which God intendeth to ſhew thee in this place. By which voice his hart was ſo altered that thence forward he felt a great quantitie of ſpirituall giftes in his interiour, God continuallie viſiting him, and remayning there, he burned with an ineffable flame of his loue, and therfore, he was often in his contemplations eleuated ſo high, that as Brother Leo recounted who was then his companion and a curious obſeruer of all his actions, he could not diſcerne nor comprehend him with his ſight, ſurpaſsing the high cloudes of heauen; which is not ouer-greatly to be admired, conſidering that in this world he led a life more angelicall then humane. He, as he afterward recounted to his companions, there demaunded as a ſinguler grace of his God, to be entierlie transformed into his anguiſhes and dolours, ſith his Maieſtie had not voutſafed to accept of his life, which ſo manie times he had offered vnto him, as the onlie thing he had to offer, hauing no other thing in this world,

and hauing ſo often gone among the infidels there to receaue Martyrdome in the ſeruice of his diuine maieſty: Wherfore it was incontinent. lie reuealed vnto him of God, that as he had alwayes endeauoured perfectly to follow and imitate his life, and actions, ſo ſhould he be permitted to be like vnto him, and to ſuffer with him in the dolours, of his paſsion. Which the holy Father vnderſtanding, albeit he were already exceedingly weakned, by the rigour of his life paſt, and by the continuall croſſe with he had carryed, yet he was fo farre from being troubled with all, that he encouraged himſelfe, and enamoured himſelfe the more to ſuffer a Martyrdome ſo noble and worthy aboue all others, and by the interiour burning flame he extinguiſhed the water of all the afflictions and dolours that euer could befall him, and deſired no leſſe perfection, to receaue in himſelfe ſo ineſtimable a treaſure.
               
               
                  How S. Francis receaued the ſacked stigmates of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                  
                  THE LV. CHAPTER.
                  THe moſt feruent Father S. Francis being thus highly eleuated in God, by an extreme ardor of celeſtiall deſires, and transformed into IESVS CHRIST, crucified for our ſinnes, by ſweetnes of compaſsion on the day of the exaltation of the holy croſſe, which is the fourteenth of September, a litle before the breake of day, there appeared vnto him this viſion following: He ſaw an Angel deſcend from
                        
                           •
                        ſay. 6. heauen like vnto the Seraphin with ſix winges in the Prophett Eſay, enflamed with a moſt reſplendant fire, whoſe beames were ſo glittering, that to humane eyes they were inſupportable. This Angel approaching vnto the S. being already in the region of the aire ſo neere vnto him that he might ſee him, there ſtayed: and then the S. beholding him more attentiuely ſaw the image of IESVS CHRIST crucified imprinted in him, which had the two winges croſſed on high, as were thoſe belowe, ſo that the endes of thoſe vpper paſſed the hight of the head, &amp; thoſe below paſſed the ſoles of the feet, &amp; the other two paſſed on each ſide the endes of the fingers &amp; handes, the two armes being ſtretched in forme of a croſſe. The ſoule of S. Francis was with this admirable appatition exceedingly melted, being ſurpriſed with a contentment &amp; an extreme greife entermingled ſo together, that it was impoſsible to explicate, whither of the two were greater, for on the one ſide he exceedinglie reioyced, beholding himſelfe in the mirour, wherin the Angels themſelues cannot be wearie to looke, and wherin are encloſed

the treaſures of all beautitude, and keeping his eyes alwayes more fixed on that celeſtiall fiery globe, ſhining with a diuine light, he conſumed with loue and ſweetnes: but on the other ſide, conſidering his God ſo cruelly faſtened on the croſſe with hard and groſſe nailes, as he then appeared vnto him, and hauing his ſide opened with the ſtroke of a lance, he by commiſeration experienced that cruell iron, which pearced the delicate breaſt of the Virgin Mary, in ſuch ſort that he no leſſe felt that dolour, then if himſelfe had bin crucified in that manner, yea by his interiour compaſsion he was fullie transformed into his beloued IESVS CHRIST. No man can doubt hereof, ſith this viſion was not as others, appearing only to the exteriour eyes, but it was effectiue and operatiue by an act not heard of, in the verie bodie of his Sainct, imprinting in him the verie woundes which he had, by meanes of his diuine beames, which from his two handes, his two feet, and ſide, he ſent into his handes, feet, and ſide, not ſpirituallie, or imaginatiuelie only, but ſenſiblie and corporally, opening his ſide, and pearcing his handes and feet; and this was not only for the preſent, but for an eternall teſtimonie he left him the nailes framed of his verie fleſh fixed therin, the heades of the nayles lardge appearing without in the paulmes of his handes, but round and of iron colour, and on the other ſides the pointes clinched, for the woundes were tranſpearced through both ſides, ſo that att the principall wound, wherby the handes were pearced from one ſide to an other with the ſaid nayles, on the ſide where the pointes of the nayle was clinched, there was ſuch a ſpace betweene the ſuperiour part of the hand, and the tourned clinch of the nayle, that betweene the ſame one might putt in a finger; the like might be ſaid of the feet: ſo that thenceforward he could not ſtand vpon them but with extreme paine; in ſuch ſort that beſides the inceſſant running of the bloud, it was verie troubleſome vnto him; as alſo was the wound of his ſide which was verie lardge and open, the fleſh being there growen againe in forme of a cicatrice, which was of the colour of a roſe, as it was ſeene afterward by diuers, hauing touched the ſame, as in place conuenient ſhalbe inſerted. Our ſoueraigne Lord and God, leauing in the body of his feruant, a liuely, true, and long memoriall of his dolorious Paſsion, not without a moſt profound iudgement, and immenſiue ſigne, of an exceſsiue loue vnto vs, for ſeeing that the memory of his bitter paſsion was vtterly extinguiſhed in our harts, he would not this other miſterious paſsion, for our cauſe only, renued in the body of his ſeruant, ſhould be ſo ſoone forgottē. In which reſpect it was neceſſary that he ſhould endure it, not one houre or two, one day or a month, but two yeares entierly, the hard

obſtinacie, and obſtinate hardnes of our hartes oppoſite and rebellions to his diuine Maieſtie, ſo requiring it to procure vs with efficacie to remember the other.
               
               
                  How the glorious Father ſainct Francis was att length conſtrained to reueale the impreſsion of his stigmates, to ſuch as were most familiar vnto him.
                  THE LVI. CHAPTER.
                  NOw after this admirable cōmunication, performed with ſuch and ſo great a prerogatiue as a greater could not be imagined, the altare eukindled in the breſt of the holie Father, burned with the immenſiue charitie he had vnto his God; but leauing this to the deuoutſoules, that raiſe themſelues from the earth towardes their Creatour, we will proſecute the hiſtorie, telling how he diſcouered this treaſure vnto the world. Sainct Francis then hauing finiſhed his lent which he faſted in the honour of ſainct Michal the Archangel, and hauing giuen thanckes to God, he diſcended to the foot of the Mountaine, carrying with him the diuine image of IESVS CHRIST crucified, not in tables of ſtone or wood carued and engrauen by the hand of ſome humane or Angelicall Maſter, but written and imprinted in the membres of his properfleſh, by the handes of the Sonne of God himſelfe, not caſting his precious ſtones before euery body; becauſe he feared much to manifeſt to litle purpoſe ſo great a ſecret of God; yet withall he found it impoſsible to conceale the ſame, att leaſt from his companions, that were hourly with him; therfore calling them together, he propoſed vnto them his doubt, as in a third perſonne, not ſpecifying the fact, but only ſpeaking generally of the reuelations of the ſecrettes of God. But Brother Illuminato, truely illuminated of God, ayming att that which proued true, that Sainct Francis had receaued of God ſome reuelations of very great importance, eſpecially perceauing him to be as out of himſelfe, he thus anſweared: Beloued Father, who knoweth better then your ſelfe, that for the moſt part, and almoſt alwayes God giueth great reuelations to his ſeruantes not for themſelues alone, but for others alſo, as hath bin ſeene that it hath pleaſed him att lengtht to manyfeſt them all? Wherfore it ſeemeth to me that you hauing receaued ſuch, ſhould proue ingratefull to God if you conceale that which he hath wrought in you more for the ſaluation of the world, then for your owne particuler, therby burying his talent vnder the earth. Which the holy Father vnderſtanding, as from the mouth of God, beſides what he often ſaid with the

Prophet: My ſecrett vnto my ſelfe, my ſecrett vnto my ſelfe, he veryEſay. 6. humbly recounted vnto them the viſion he had, the ſucceſſe thereof, &amp; many other moſt high and diuine matters, vnder the ſeale of ſecreſie, which is not to be doubted but God did reueale vnto him in ſo merueillous a coniunction.
               
               
                  How his ſacred woundes were ſcene of diuers during his life.

                  BVt it being impoſsible for the holy Father to conceale this light with God would haue to ſhine to all the world, on an high candleſtick: though he could couer his feet with his ſandales when he would, and his handes with the sleeues of his habitt; yet he was conſtrayned in the end to manifeſt them. Brother Leo his Confeſſour, ſaw them euery day, the holy Father being of neceſsity to vſe him, as a Phiſition, to dreſſe his holy ſtigmates, whence did continually diſtill bloud, and to change the linnen and putt tentes betweene the nailes and fleſh with incredible paine and patience of the holy Father. Neuertheles, he would not haue them touched on the friday, becauſe he would endure the more, and ſo ſuffer with his Sauiour. Brother Ruffinus, who as S. Francis affirmed was already for his ſanctity of life canonized in heauen, hauing many times ſeene the woundes ofBrother Leo and Br. Ruffinus, S. Clare, the Cardinal protector and the bishop Vgolino, ſaw the holy Stygmates &amp; woundes of S. Fr. in his life time. the handes and feet of the S. deſired alſo very earneſtlie to ſee that of his ſide wherof he held himſelfe as fully aſſured, by waſhing his linnen bretches, which he alwayes found embrued with bloud on the right ſide, and annoynting his ſtomack with oyntmentes, inſinuating himſelfe and thruſting his hand farther then he needed, did often touch it with his fingers, and ſometimes the S. felt much greife thereby; neuertheles he had a verie extreme deſire for his conſolation to ſee it: And therfore one day, faigning to requeſt the holy Fathers habitt, of deuorion to chaunge it for his owne, and requiring it for the loue of IESVS CHRIST, he ſo wrought, that the S. who could not deny any thinge that was demaunded him in the name of God, not ſuſpecting any other thing, putting of his habitt to giue him, he contented him therin though he did his endeauour to hide the ſame. S. Clare that made him many plaiſters for dreſsing therof, deſerued to ſee them, the S. ſhewing them all vnto her, in regard that ſhe was ſuch an Eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST as each one knoweth, and the eldeſt daughter in God of the S. The ſaid plaiſter is with great reuerence ſhewen for a relique in the Couent of S. Clare att Aſsiſium. The Cardinal of Hoſtia, Protectour of the Order, law

Franc. with his hād touching a man that was extrem cold did warme him. THe ſame God that had imprinted the ſacred ſtigmates in his ſeruant for the good of the world, would not haue them buryed in ſilence; but did miraculously manifeſt them, as to his maieſtie ſeemed conuenient, which he did, as well for his owne glorie, as for the benefitt of faithfull ſoules, who ſeeing his ſacred woundes in his ſeruant, encreaſed in faith, and glorifyed the author of them in his ſainct. There raigning a great peſtilence among the cattell of the Country of Riete, which procured their death, notwithſtanding any remedy that could be inuented; God reuealed vnto a deuout perſon that he should procure to gett of the water that fell from the handes of his ſeruant Francis, when he washed them, and therewith should ſprinckle the cattell, and ſo they should be cured: The man fearing God, went and gott of the ſaid water, and with faith experienced the application, and all the cattell that were touched therwith, though halfe dead, aroſe ſound and ſecure on their feet. Before S. Francis had the ſtigmates, there aroſe euery yeare a cloud, with a tempeſt neere the Mount Aluerne, that deſtroyed all the fruit of that place: But after he receaued them, that tempeſt neuer appeared which procured great admiration to all the world. Being one time accompanyed with a poore man, himſelfe riding on an aſſe, by reaſon that the woundes that were vnder his feet hindered his goeing, the night hauing ſurpriſed them, they retired themſelues vnder the couerture of a mountaine, where the poore man, for the extreme cold which he felt could not sleep, and tourning himſelfe from one ſide to an other, did nothing but ſigh and lament: Whereof the holie Father hauing compaſsion, touched him with one of his ſacred handes, and the poore man in ſteed of the bitter cold which he felt, incontinentlie found himſelfe ſo exceeding hoate, that he ſeemed to be in a ſtoue or hoate houſe, where he ſweetlie slept till the morning, and afterward affirmed that in al his life he neuer slept better. A woman of Arrezzo had ſo dangerous a labour that she was abandonned of the phiſicions, and the health of her bodie being deſperate, there was no care but of her ſoule: it happened by chaunce that the aſſe wheron S. Francis had ridden was brought to drinck neere vnto the houſe of the ſaid woman, which her kinred knowinge, they tooke of

the bridle, which S. Francis ſitting on the aſſe had held in his handes, &amp;A womā being in extreme dāgerous labour was deliuered by holding the bridle which S. F. did ride with all. hauing with great faith girded the woman therewith, ſhe was preſently without danger deliuered. God wrought ſuch miracles during his life, that by them it might appeare that his ſacred ſtigmates were truely worckes of his omnipotent hand; but he made it much more apparent after his death, as here enſuying ſhalbe declared, though they happening afterward ſeeme not conuenient to be written as yet, neuertheles I doe it that the matter may be ſeene well vnited together.
               
               
                  Of the testimonies of the woundes of the Seraphicall Father S. Francis, by the holy Apoſtolicall ſea.
                  THE LIX. CHAPTER.
                  POpe Gregorie the ninth, himſelfe ſaw and touched the handes and feet of the glorious S. and becauſe he ſaw not that of the ſide he had no great beleife therof; Wherfore ſome time before he canonized S. Francis, one night in his sleep, as himſelfe often affirmed, the S. appeared vnto him as in choller, and reprehending him of hisPope Gregory by a bulle aſſureth and confirmeth the truth of the stigmates ſclender faith, lifted vp his right arme, and ſhewed him the wound of his ſide: then demaunding a cuppe it ſeeming to his Holynes that he deliuered him one, it was preſently filled with bloud. By this apparition, he afterward remayned aſſured of the wound, which he ſo reuerenced that being vnable to endure the enuie and lewdnes of ſome that impugned the ſame, ſtriuing to darckē the glory of ſo ſinguler a miracle, he commanded by the firſt bulle he publiſhed, that this truth ſhould be beleeued, as affirmed by Apoſtolicall ſentence. The bulle beginneth: The glorious Confeſſour: then afterward he ſaith: We by the tenour of theſe preſentes declare vnto all people, that the ſtigmates of this glorious S. hauing in his life time and after his death bin ſeene in his body, the ſame hath bin approued with his other miracles, by our venerable Brethren, the Cardinals of the holy Church: wherfore we haue had iuſt occaſion to enrole him in the catalogue of SS. And becauſe in the beginning of this veritie there were two eccleſiaſticall perſonnes that publiquelie declared themſelues aduerſaries to the ſaid ſtigmates, one of who was Brother Euerard, an Alleman Preacher, who in his ſermōnes auouched that he neuer had thoſe woundes: and the other was the Archbiſhop of Colleigne, who commanded the ſaid ſtigmates to be putt out of his image; the ſaid Gregorie the ninth, made and ſent two breuies againſt them, the one of which being directed to the Prouincials and Priours of the Order of Preachers was ſuch, Gregorie Bishop: we hauing heard with no leſſe greife then meruaile,

that a Religious of your Order▪ named Euerard, not remembring that the ſermons of Preachers ought to be ſeaſoned with the ſalt of grace; being att Copania, a citty of Morauia, of a Preacher becomming a blaſphemer, was not aſhamed to affirme that the ſtigmates of the holie ſeruant of God Francis, that were ſo miraculouslie by diuine Maieſtie imprinted on him, were fables, and ought to be reproued; what could he ſay more? He att one ſame time depriued the holie ſeruant of God, of his honour and glorie, yea God himſelfe, who by a ſinguler priuiledge and excellent myſterie gaue him thoſe ſignes, and hath depriued vs of aucthoritie and dew reſpect, conſidering that he hath preſumed to impugne our auctoritie; for we haue approued the ſaid ſtigmates; not onlie as hauing heard relation therof by perſonnes worthie of creditt, and bin aſſured therof by verie authenticall written teſtimonies; but ouer ſelues alſo haue ſeene them with our proper eyes, and touched them with our verie handes, Now wePlus vnus oculatus, quam decem allriti. vnderſtand that the ſaid Religious is mounted to ſuch audacitie, as he preſumeth to preach publikelie, to the diſhonour of the Religious Frere Minors, baptiſing them before the people with the falſe name and title of dore-begging preachers and lyers, adding that they ought to be preuented and excommunicated. All theſe thinges conſidered, we command you in vertue of this preſent Apoſtolicall Breuie, to ſuſpend the ſaid Religious from the facultie of preaching, in what place ſoeuer he ſhall appeare, and vſing all meanes to gett him into your handes, you ſhall incontinentlie ſend him vnto vs; that we may inflict on him the puniſhment due to his deſert.
                  The other Breuy that was directed to the Arch-biſhop of Coileigne was thus: The diuine wiſdome; that firſt framed man according to his fleſh to redeeme him, by the myſtery of his holy Incarnation; he alſo hath adorned his ſeruant Francis with the ſame woundes, &amp; that it is ſo, we with the Colledge of our venerable brethren the cardinals haue approued the ſame, hauing bin aſſured therof by diuers perſonnes of vertuous life, and haue our ſelues ſeene very authentical teſtimonies therof: and beſides we haue bin induced by our ſelues, that haue with our owne eyes ſeene, and touched them with our owne handes. For which reſpectes we haue really and with iuſt reaſon concluded, that it ought to be held for truth: wherfore we command you that vnderſtanding this our intention and probation of them, youPope Alexander the 4. did as much. alſo publikelie approue them, and not to permitt any within your dioceſſe to contradict them. Pope Alexander the fourth that ſaw them, made alſo a Breuie in approbation of them, and commanded the Frere Minors neuer to leaue the Oratorie of Mount Aluerne, where

theire holie Father had receaued ſo ſinguler a gift of God. PopeAnd Pope Benedict the 2. Benedict the ſecond, ordayned by a Breuie that the Frere Minors ſhould celebrate the feaſt, and ſay the office of the ſaid ſacred ſtigmates of the glorious Father ſainct Francis: All which teſtimonies, (and manie other which for breuitie I omitt) we were willing to inſert in this place, becauſe the malice of enuie, that wilbe of as long continuance as the world, had enforced vs therto, by reaſon that ſo admirable a miracle ought not to be related, without due circumſtances and proofes, to make mute the perfidious tongues of the euill minded enuious.
               
               
                  Of the zeale of the honour of God, and ſaluation of ſoules which the holy Father ſainct Francis had, after the impreſsion of the ſacred stigmates, and of the figures precedent.
                  THE LX. CHAPTER.
                  THis glorious Sainct hauing felt in his proper fleſh the dolours paine of the paſsion of God, and as it were partlie experienced, of what deere price ſoules were vnto the Sonne of God, he to looſe no time began incontinentlie to trauaile ouer all cittyes and townes inſtructing by meane of prayer, preaching, and the example of good life, God aſsiſting with merueillous miracles, in teſtimonie of his docttine, to redeeme the precious ſoules of poore Chriſtians out of the mouth of the perfidious Lucifer, he being armed with theſe weapons of the croſſe, that alwayes ouerthrow euerie ennemie corporall and ſpirituall of the elect of God, who continuallie gett the victorie. And as a new Legat deputed of his diuine maieſtie, he carryed with him the ſea le of the ſoueraigne biſhop IESVS CHRST, wherwith he confirmed his doctrine and his worckes. Therby did he trulie appeare to be ſent of God: wherfore he not onlie found no contradiction where he went, but was exceeding gratefull to all all perſonnes. Beſides that, this is alſo worthy of merueillous conſideration, that as in all thinges deſeruing perpetuall memorie for being of great conſequence, it ſemeth that his diuine Maieſtie alwayes obſerued three condicions, propheſying or figuring them precedently, approuing them by good teſtimonies with the rumour of preſent renowme, and confirming them afterward by diuine ſignes and miracles; in like ſort would he obſerue three conditions in this ſinguler fauour, wherof the rumour, renowme, and manifeſt proofe, being ſeene for the

time preſent, and the miracles afterward, it reſteth now that we demonſtrate the figure, by which this ſinguler act hath in a certaine manner bin many times propheſied. Firſt it ſeemed to be ſignified by the viſion of the glittering and reſplendant ſoules, marcked with the ſigne of the croſſe, of whome God conſtituted him his captaine in the beginning of his conuerſion. The ſame alſo ſeemed to be ſignified by the viſion of the cruciſix that interiourly tranſpearced his ſoule with exceſsiue ſorrow, with the voice that told him he muſt repaire his holy church. And it was alſo ſignified by the croſſe which Brother Silueſter ſaw to come out of his mouth, that expelled the dragon of hell. Againe it was denoted by the viſion which Brother Pacificus had before he was conuerted, when he ſaw two glittering ſwordes, that made a croſſe vpon his breſt. Finally it was ſignified by the apparition which S. Francis made att the Chapter of Arles, in forme of a croſſe in the aire, giuing his benediction to the Religious there aſſembled. Lett no man therfore preſume to contradict ſo certaine a truth, denounced and propheſied by figures, ſeene viſibily, touched palpably, approued by the church iuſtlie, and finally by IESVS CHRIST confirmed, by ſo many miracles in earth and in heauen.
               
               
                  Of the new ſeruour, and merueillous patience of the ſainct.
                  THE LXI. CHAPTER.
                  
                     S. F. vſed a ſtaffe to goe with all the two laſt years of his life by reaſon of his ſtigmates as he had don the two firſt yeares of his conuerſion. Luc. 10. THe holy Father S. F. finding himſelfe enriched with ſo glorious a treaſure, made his habitt to be lengthened, as much as was poſsible to couer the ſame, and began thenceforward to carry a ſtaffe, wherwith he walked about the houſe, though verie ſeldome, being vnable by reaſon of the ſacred woundes to ſett his feet on the ground. It is admirable to conſider, that as in the two firſt yeares of his conuerſion, before he founded the Order, he carryed a ſtaffe, ſo he began againe to carry it two yeares before his death, that he might end by the walking ſtaffe as a true Pilgrime on earth, albeit he had left it vpon obſeruation of the worde of IESEVS CHRIST, who commanded his diſciples not to carry it in their iorney, ſignifying, that they ſhould not relye on any fauour of the world, vnderſtood by the ſtaffe or ſtalke of a reed more perillous then ſecure; and afterwardes he conformed himſelfe to the ancient fathers, who vſed it att their hermitages, as ſainct Paul the firſt hermite, ſainct Antony and others, and not to be ſinguler herein, he gaue leaue to all the Religious

to vſe one in their infirmities, ſickneſſes and old age. Afterward burning with this ſeruent fire of charitie towardes God and his neighbour, he was carryed, as we haue formerlie ſaid, through cittyes and townes, where he preached with exceſsiue feruour, thirſting with an extraordinarie burning deſire to ſee the nomber of the elect of God accompliſhed; to which places he was ſo welcome and gratefull, that when he went from the people he was halfe naked becauſe each one ſtriued to cutt part of his habitt, ſome with cicers, others with pincers or like inſtrumentes, carefullie keeping thoſe ſhreddes afterwardes as reliques, with moſt pious deuotion, for cure of diſeaſes and dangers of this life, others brought him bread to bleſſe, wherof afterward to make vſe in like neceſsities, hauing ſeene therof manifeſt experiences. Notwithſtanding all this, the holie Father had a violent deſire to retourne to that former humilitie and ſimplicitie of ſeruing leapers, and of not knowing the imperfections of his diſciples, as he was afterwardes forced to know them, and alſo of enduring auſteritie of life. To this effect he ſaid to his Religious: My Brethren, we muſt now begin to ſerue God for to this preſent we haue done nothing or verie litle. So he propoſed in his ſpiritt to performe great matters, not conſidering the weaknes of bodie, by reaſon of the great feruour of his ſpiritt, wherwith being carryed away, he deſired nothing but freſh combattes to gett victorie ouer the ennemie, and indeed, he that well conſidereth it, ſindeth that feeblenes nor tepeditie haue any place, where the port is alwayes open vnto true loue, which inuiteth and induceth to attempt impoſsibilityes. And ſo much the more by reaſon that he had accuſtomed his fleſh to obey the ſpiritt, and had ſuch a promptitude to obey God, that he was ſo farre from reſiſting, that he ſtroue and endeauoured to worcke aboue his forces. Wherfore God that knew his deſire, opened vnto him the meanes of meritt, ſo that he did not onlie deſire, with the ineffable doloures of his infirmitie, which did ſo afflict him from the ſoale of his feet to the crowne of his head, that he had neuer repoſe; he endured in each of his members an extreame and particuler paine; in ſuch ſort that in ſhort time he came to haue nothing but skin on his bones. In all theſe afflictions he diſcouered his deſire of them, ſith that he was neuer heard to vtter ſo much as one worde of complaint, but he called his dolours his brethren, and his diſeaſes his ſiſters, yet he anſweared the Religious, who being moued with compaſsion wiſhed him to pray vnto God, that he would pleaſe to appeare a litle more merciful
                        •
                      towardes him, that if he did not hold him excuſed in regard of his ſimplicity, he would teach him what it was to check God in his

iudgementes. He omitted not yet to chaſtice in his body, the exceſſe of the offence of this Religious, for rudely flinging himſelfe out of his bed vpon the ground, he tourned and wallowed vpon it, often kiſſing it gaue thanckes vnto God, prayſed him, and beſought him for his greater conſolations to redouble his afflictions: which wordes ended. The Religious by force of armes laid him againe on his bed: for he could not helpe himſelfe into it. O inuincible patience of this glorious S. comparable to that of Iob! he was doubtles both ioyfull and humble in his tribulations, as an other S. Paul conſidering that the more he endured of greater paines in his body, the greater vigour and force appeared in his ſoule, beſides what affliction his ſtigmates procured him, which continually diſtilled bloud, with ſuch extreme grife, that it was humanely impoſsible for him to ſupport them only two dayes, not two yeares as he did for augmentation of his meritt and example vnto the world.
               
               
                  How God ſometimes conforted his faithfull ſeruant in his afflictions.
                  THE LXII. CHAPTER.
                  ALl this being very well knowne to almighty God, beſide the interiour vertue which he beſtowed on him, he did often comfort him exteriourlie. One day to mitigate his dolours therby to raiſe his ſpiritt vnto God, he had a deſire to heare ſome prayſe ſung vnto his diuine maieſty, vpon ſome inſtrumentes. And therfore he told Brother Pacificus, who had bin a famous &amp; excellent Poete, that though men of this world abuſe muſicall inſtrumentes▪ which were inuented to prayſe God, as in deed ſo many holy men had prayſed him theron: he ſhould neuertheleſſe finde meane to haue ſecretly a violle, and for his conſolation, ſhould ſing ſome ſpirituall prayſe, affirming that therin was no offence vnto God, and that it ſeemed the greifes of his bodye by that meane would tourne into conſolation and ioy of the ſpiritt. But Br. Pacificus hauing anſweared that in ſo dooing he might ſcandalizeGod ſent Angelicall muſick to comfort S. Franc. in his ſicknes. the world, he replyed that he had reaſon, and that he ſhould let it alone. Now God who had a ſpeciall care of him, incontinently ſent an Angel that ſounded and gaue ſo ſweet a touch to a violl, as may be imagined that an Angel of Paradiſe could doe, in the ſame inſtant comforting both the afflicted body and the ſoule of the great ſeruant of God. Addreſsing himſelfe therfore to Bro. Pacificus, who had not heard the melodie no more then his other companions, he cauſed them to giue thanckes vnto God, for the great conſolation which he had voutſafed to ſend him.
                  
                     
Being in the houſe of the Biſhop of Aſsiſium vtterlie without all taſt, and vnable to eat any thing by reaſon of the griefe of his infirmities,And alſo ſent him fish and lettice miraculouſly in his ſicknes. his companyons asked him wherof he would willingly eat; he anſweared them: If I could haue a few litle fiſhes of fresh water, me thincketh I could eat of them. Theſe wordes being ended there entred a boy that brought him many as ſent from Brother Girard Miniſter of Riete, though it were winter and ſo extreme cold, that it was impoſsible to take them the riuers being frozen. The Religious exceedinglie admired to perceaue the care which God had to releiue the neceſsities of his ſeruant and eſpecially in thinges impoſsible to men. An other time, deſiring to haue a litle lettice he asked ſome of his companiō who anſweared that the ſame day they had bin all gathered. Goe into the garden, ſaid he, and bring me the firſt herbe that cometh to thy hād, which ſhall be a lettice. The Religious went and found a very faire lettice, and thanking him who had there ſet the ſame for the conſolation of the ſeruant of God, he tooke it vp with great ioy and brought it vnto him: and the S. hauing eaten a therof, leafe felt himſelfe fully conforted.
               
               
                  How he was aſsured of the Glory of Paradiſe.
                  THE LXIII. CHAPTER.
                  BVt becauſe there cannot be giuen to a ſeruant of God a greater conſolation then the hope and certainty of the glorie to come, wherto S. Paul eſteemed not the paſsions of this world cōdigne, howſoeuer greiuous and continuall they might be; The S. goeing one day for his conſolation to viſitt S. Clare, with Brother Leonard of Aſsiſium his companion, the ſweetnes of their ſpirituall diſcourſes was ſuch and ſo great, that the night ſurpriſed thē before they perceaued it. Wherfore conſtrayned by her prayers, her Siſters and her companions, he did eat two morcels with them, and in an inſtant he was ſwallowed vp in the holy Ghoſt and rauiſhed in extaſie, with a deep contentment, where he heard that which ſequentlie ſhalbe related. Being retourned to himſelfe he cryed out with a loud voice; My God be thou prayſed, and incontinentlie went to our Lady of Angels. Ariſing from the table, he fell on his knees and there was againe in extaſie the ſpace of an hower, then inſtantly went away and left S. Clare and her ſiſters who were exceedingly greiued t
                        •
                     erewith. His Cōpany admiring theratt asked him the cauſe in their way: the S. acknowledge it vnto them, affirming that in the extaſie God had reuealed vnto him his ſaluation by theſe verie wordes: Francis I promiſe thee eternall life and aſſure thee therof, in ſuch ſort as I tell thee thou canſt no way looſe it: for which I thancked

him, ſaying: Prayſe be to thee my God: then he forbad them to ſpeake thereof till after his death. Being come to our Lady of Angels, for eyght howers together he could not vtter other wordes then theſe: Be thou prayſed my God: yea he could not ſay his canonicall houres by reaſon of the ioy that had ſurpriſed his hart. After that time his infirmitie in ſuch ſort encreaſing that it manifeſtlie appeared he could not liue long, one of his f

                     eindes, ſeeing him cloathed with his courſeſt and patched habitt, and hauing a peece of rugged cloth on his forehead for the infirmitie of his eyes, in ſpirituall mirth ſaid vnto him: Father how will you ſell this old habitt? Oh how ſoone will God buy it of you, and pay you deerlie for it! giuing you in exchaunge therof an infinitye of precious garmentes of ſilke and gold beſides eternall▪ glorie afterward in the other world. The S. induced and inſpired of the holy Ghoſt, ſodenly anſweared. Brother thou haſt reaſon, for ſo ſhall it be, to the honour and glory of God.
               
               
                  Of the laſt and extreme ſicknes that augmented and redoubled in the holy Father S. Francis.
                  THE LXIV. CHAPTER.
                  BEſides all the other infirmities of his eyes, his ſtomacke, his liuer, and the greife of his ſtigmates, there fell alſo a dropſie into his feet ſix monethes before his bleſſed end: Notwithſtanding he omitted not to viſitt the monaſteries, citties and townes, to procure the ſaluation of ſoules. But his infirmities growing dailyThe Aſsiſians ſent to pray S. Franc▪ to dwell and end his dayes att Aſsiſium. more violent, the cittizens of Aſsiſium iealous of ſo noble and precious a treaſure which by right appertayned vnto them, and fearing it would be robbed from them vpon the way, they ſent Embaſſadours to their holy Father, who was then neere to Sienna, to pray and by all ſweetnes and amity to enforce him to retourne to his Monaſterie. Sainct Francis failed not to comfort them, yelding that benefitt to them who in the beginning of his conuerſion, vſed him as a foole: wherin each one may conſider the admirable diſpoſition of God: and then lett him deride his Sai
                        •

Now on the way theſe Cittizens came to a village, ſomewhat later then they expected: by which meane they were diſappointed of all prouiſion, finding there no Inne, but onlie houſes, of countrie people, which refuſed to afford the company victuals for monie. They who had chardge of the prouiſion, recounted this diſcurteſie to Sainct Francis: who anſweared: See now what vſe you make of your monyflies, retourne againe, and demaund ſomething to eat for the loue

of God, and you ſhall experience what difference there is betweene the vaine hopes of the world, and the true and aſſured hope of God. TheThe aſsiſians found food for the loue of God, which was denied them for mony▪
                      gentlemen obeyed the S. and found for the loue of God ſo much to eat, that they knew not what to doe with ſo much food: Herevpon the S. ſaid vnto them: you are of opinion that it is a ſhamefull thing to demaund an almoſe: but tell me, wherwith doth all the world liue, but with the continuall almoſe giuen by almightie God? They were all filled with great admiration, and ſilent with confuſion: and ſo ſhrincking their ſhoulders, they proceeded on their iorney, conducting their Father to his Country, whither being come and for more ſecurity brought to the Pallace of the Biſhop of Aſsiſium, maſter Bon Iohn, a Phiſicion and his deere freind came to viſitte him, whome he prayed to tell him freely his opinion of that ſicknes, adi

                  Of the conſolation or exerciſe of the S. on his later dayes.
                  THE LXV. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father in this greiuous ſicknes had no other recreation and conſolation but to prayſe God, and to procure his companions to prayſe him, by himnes, pſalmes, and ſpirituall Canticles, with which alone and without any other comfort of the world, he qualified that his greiuous infirmity his dolours &amp; his paines, which were ſuch and ſo cruell, that as he affirmed, it had bin far more tollerable with all kinde of torment to endure a dolourous death by the handes of the executioner, then to ſuffer what he endured. But conſidering that the diuine ſpiritt doth not accord with the humane, nor the children of light, with the children of the world, Brother Helias his Vicar Generall, who went with the ſaid Cittizens to pray him to retourne to Aſsiſium, and who forſoke him not till his death, to whome on night, two yeares before his death, there appeared a venerable old man, in a white habitt, this was in an Oratory nere to Fulliniū
                     
who willed him to aduertiſe S. Francie that from thence two yeares, he ſhould be called of God out of this world, which he had told him; this man then ſeeing this his ſo vnaccuſtomed alacrity amiddes ſo many tormentes, and that he did nothing but ſing, and cauſe to be ſung prayſes to God, without otherwiſe lamenting his ſinnes, as formerly he accuſtomed to doe, ſayd vnto him, that himſelfe and his moſt affectionat freindes were much edified by this his ioy in that mortall infirmity, &amp; were aſſured that it proceeded only of the integrity of his conſcience, which knowing it ſelfe pure before God, could feare nothing. Not withſtanding it was not conuenient in preſence of ſo many ſeculers, who all knew him to be nerre death, to ſhew no ſigne of repentance of his offences paſt, no remorſe of his ſinnes committed againſt God, attleaſt in this terrible paſſadge of death. S. Francis with great feruour anſweared him: Brother giue me leaue, giue me leaue I pray thee to reioyce in God and in his prayſes, during this ſicknes, becauſe by the grace of the holy Ghoſt, my ſpiritt is in ſuch ſort vnited vnto his diuine Maieſtie, and ſo ſecure that it may reioyce: Remember now, that there are two yeares paſt ſince you deliuered me from him an aduertiſment of this my paſſadge: ſince which time I haue alwayes endeauoured to prepare my ſelfe, lamenting my ſinnes, and ſatisfying God for them. But ſithence that by his immenſiue grace, he hath made me worthy of his glory, as he hath reuealed vnto me, I haue euer ſince endeauoured to reioyce, and now ſo much more in that the time approacheth, wherin my ſoule ſhall for euer be looſed from the waight of this body, and ſhall goe towardes him who hath created it, and in that he will not omitt in me to edifie this people.
               
               
                  How the S. made himſelfe be carryed to our Lady of Angels, finding his death to approach.
                  THE LXVI. CHAPTER.
                  THe glorious Father therfore perceauing that the day of his death approached, prayed all the gentlemen and his freindes there preſent, to cauſe him to be carryed to his church of our Lady of Angels, that he might render vnto God the ſpiritt of life, where he had receaued of him the ſpiritt of grace: So hauing obtayned permiſsion of the biſhop and Gouernour of the citty, they went accōpanyed with the greateſt part of the ſaid citty, and comming to the hoſpitall, which is in the great ſtreet betweene the citty and our Lady of Angels, cauſing himſelfe with his bed to be ſett on the ground, and tourning towardes the citty he gaue it his benediction, ſaying: Citty bleſſed mayeſt thou be of

the ſoueraigne God, becauſe by thee many ſoules ſhalbe ſaued, and in thee many worthy ſeruantes of God of both ſex ſhall make their reſidence, and by thy meane, many ſhall attaine the kingdome of glorie. So hauing bleſſed the citty, and proceeding his way towardes our Lady of Angels, S. Clare his deere and true diſciple, imitatrice and daughter in IESVS CHRIST, fearing ſhe ſhould not ſee him before his death, ſent to aduertiſe him, that herſelfe was alſo in ſuch eſtate, as ſhe ſhould not liue long after, yea that ſhe thought to goe firſt; and that therfore ſhe felt an extreme greife, to dye without his holy benediction &amp; without ſeeing him, who was her maſter and beloued Father in CHRIST IESVS: and for that occaſion ſhe prayed him for the paſsion of our Lord I. C. with her knees on the ground, not to permitt her to dye ſo diſcontent: but ſith he was in his iorney, to doe her that laſt and ſinguler fauour as to viſitt her, before he went to our Lady of Angels. The holie Father S. Francis felt the bowels of Fatherly cōpaſsion to moue in him, in that he could not content her, by reaſon of the imminēt perill wherin he was, and that the Phiſicions, nobles and gentlemen there preſent would not to permitt him; yet procuring wherwith all to write, he ſent her by a Religious his benediction in writing, then lifting his eyes toS. Franc. propheſieth that S. Clare shall ſee him before her death. heauen he ſaid vnto him: Goe and comfort my beloued ſiſter, telling her this good newes, that ſhe shall ſee me before she dye, which shalbe shortly: as shall all her Siſters, to their exceeding conſolation. This propheſie fayled not in the effect: for the holie Father being dead, when the Cittizens, carryed him to bury att Aſsiſium they paſſed through the monaſtery of S. Damian, as hereafter shall appeare, and ſeeing the body of the Sainct with in their Couent, they were all exceedinglie comforted therwith.
               
               
                  How a Romane Lady very deuout and affected to S. Francis called Lady Iaqueline of the ſeauen Sunnes, came by diuine reuelation from Rome to the death of S. Francis.
                  THE LXVII. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father approching neere vnto his death, called a Religious whome he willed to finde out a meſſenger to goe with al diligence to Rome, expresly to aduertiſe the Lady of the Seauen Sunnes that ſhe ſhould incontinentlie come to viſitt him if ſhe deſired to ſee him liuing; knowing in what affliction she would haue ſuruiued, if ſhe had not ſeene him before his death, as he had promiſed her when he tooke leaue of her att his departure out of Rome: and in meane while procuring wherwith to write, he dictated this letter enſuying: To

the Lady of the Seauen-Sunnes, poore Brother Francis, deſireth health in our Lord IESVS CHRIST; Know my beloued Siſter in IESVS CHRIST, that God by his grace hath reuealed vnto me the laſt day of my life: Wherfore if you deſire to ſee me liuing, haſten ſo much asS. Franc. knew in ſpiritt that the lady of the Seauen-Sunne came to ſee him. ſometime on ſaterday you may be att our Ladie of Angels, and bring with you a morcell of gray cloth wherwith to coue
                        •
                      me, and wax for my ſeruice. Att the end of this letter, it was reuealed vnto the S. that ſhe would come: wherfore he ſaid to the writer: Rent this letter for there is no need therof. He had ſcarce ended thoſe wordes, but a meſſenger came from the ſaid lady, that told him ſhe was att the gate of the Monaſtery with two of her children, ſena
                        •
                     ours of Rome, and a noble and honourable company to viſitt him. A while after the ſaid lady came, who entring his chamber, fell incontinently on the ground, humbling her countenance, as an other Magdalen, towardes his feet, bathing them with bittet teares; and 
                        •
                     mprinting her lippes in his ſacred ſtigmates, with ſuch ioy and conſolation of ſpiritt, as nothing could be more; ſhe could not be ſatisfied with kiſsing them, embracing and clipping them with all reuerence, in regard of their vertue, repreſenting vnto her thoſe of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, ſhe could not depart from him, no more could the Religious, for ſhe was entierlie rauiſhed in this ſo ſingular ſweetnes of ſpiritt, without any ſpeech att all, till S. Francis called her: att whoſe voice awakening, ſhe anſweared the S. (who asked her how it happened that ſhe came ſo readily) that being one night in prayer, ſhe heard the voice of God, that ſaid: If thou wilt find Brother Francis aliue, goe incontinentlie to our lady of Angels, and carry with thee what thow knoweſt neceſſarie to his ſepulture, and ſuch meat as thou gaueſt him att his being in Rome, to comfort him in his ſicknes. Which hauing heard, I prepared my ſelfe verie inſtantlie, and thus am come. S. Francis gaue thanckes to God, and demaunding the ſaid meates, he refected his body with very great conſolation. Now this lady ſuppoſing that S. Francis would lye long time ſick, determined to ſend back her children toS. Franc. foretold the dayes of his death &amp; buriall. Rome, and many perſonnes of note that came alſo with her: But the holy Father willed them all to ſtay, and told them he ſhould dye the ſaterday following, and be interred on the Sonday, and then they might retourne in companie, which was done. This ladie after the death of Sainct Francis, dwelt att Aſsiſium where ſhe liued verie piouslie, and was afterward buryed in the Church of Saint Francis att Aſsiſium, in a chappell adioyning to the bodie of Sainct Francis.
                  
                     
                     How S. Francis gaue his benediction to his eldeſt ſonne, Brother Bernard Quintaualle. Taken out of the ſixt chapter of the ſixt booke, and put here as the due place therof.
                     NOw whiles S. Francis was eating the ſaid meates, prepared by the handes of the ſaid Lady, calling to minde that Brother Bernard was with him att Rome the firſt time that he did eat therof; he asked thoſe preſent where he was, and cauſed him to be called to eat therof alſo. Brother Bernard being come and obeying the Sainct, hauing eaten two morcels with him perceauing that he approached neere his end, making his benefitt of the good occaſion, humblie demaunded his holie benediction. To whome ſainct Francis anſweared: my deere child I graunt it moſt willinglie: and ſo commanded his benediction to be written, which thus began: The firſt Religious and companion that God gaue me, was Brother Bernard Quintaualle, who was the firſt that began, as he that euer ſince continued, perfectlie to obſerue the rule of the goſpell and the Counfailes therof: wherfore aſwell in regard of that, as for manie other graces which God hath beſtowed on him, I am much obliged to loue him, yea aboue all other Religious of our Order. And therfore I will and ordaine that euerie other Miniſter that ſhall come hereafter, doe loue him as my ſelfe. Then he bad him ſtand att his right hand, for he had alreadie loſt his ſight. But Brother Bernard ſeeing Brother Helias that extremelie deſired it, knowing right well the need he had therof, hauing compaſsion of him, he ſent him to the right hand of the Sainct and placed himſelfe att the left, contenting himſelfe to gaine that ſoule to God, by the benediction ſo much deſired, of his beloued Father. But ſainct Francis intending to lay his hand on the head of Brother Bernard, knew either by the touch or by diuine reuelation, that it was Brother Helias, wherfore he ſodenlie called Brother Bernard, who anſwearing him, he perceaued by his voice that he was att his left hand, and therfore croſſed his handes as did the Patriarch Iacob, and gaue them his benediction, yet alwayes naming Brother Bernard he ſaid vnto him: God giue thee his benediction, &amp; encreaſe in celeſtiall benedictions of IESVS CHRIST, as thou haſt bin firſt called to this holie Religion, to ſerue for an example of Apoſtolicall life, and to demonſtrate how one ought to follow IESVS CHRIST, in pouerty and in his croſſe: ſith thou haſt not only giuen all they terreſtriall ſubſtance to his poore, but haſt offered thy very ſelfe vnto him in ſacrifice. Be thou therfore bleſſed of our lord Ieſus Chriſt and of me his poore ſeruant with an eternal

benediction, goeing, retourning, remayning, sleeping and waking. He that ſhall bleſſe thee, be he bleſſed, and lett not him that ſhall curſe thee reſt vnpuniſhed. Thou ſhall be ſuperiour of all thy Brethren and they ſhalbe ſubiect vnto thee. Lett him that thou wilt receaue into this Order, be receaued, and him that thou wilt reiect, be reiected. Thou ſhalt haue liberty to reſide where thou wilt, none hauing authority euer to forbidde, or to preſcribe thee any law, in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the bleſſed holy Ghoſt. Amen.
                     
                  
               
               
                  Of the teſtament the holy Father S. Francis made before his death.
                  THE LXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Francis, before he left his ſpirituall children, determined to leaue them his teſtament, that therin beholding the will of their holy Father, they might enable themſelues to effect it, to meritt the patrimony he bequeathed them in the Euangelicall rule and profeſsion; which teſtament was ſuch: Firſt my Brethren I will imprint in your memory how God drew me vnto him, and how I ſtripped my ſelfe all naked before the biſhopp and renounced al my poſſibilityes in the world: thē ſeeking to doe pennance, God gaue me this grace, that whereas I formerly abhorred to behold leapers (much more to ſerue thē) I began to loue thē extremely: ſo that what before ſeemed vnto me bitter &amp; inſupportable, was then pleaſing &amp; deſirable. After that I began ſimply to pray vnto God and to make vnto him this prayer: Moſt ſacred Lord, we adore thee in this place and in all the churches that are ouer all the world, and doe honoure thee; becauſe by thy holy croſſe thou haſt redeemed the world. And his diuine goodnes gaue me afterwardes ſuch faith towardes Preiſtes, that liue according to the forme of the holie Romane church, in regard of their Order, that albeit they had perſecuted me, I would haue had recourſe to none but them ſelues. And If I had had the wiſdome of Salomon, and had mett the moſt ſimpleſt Preiſt in the world, I would neuer haue preached in his church againſt his will. And them and all other will feare, loue and honour as my Lordes and maſtes, and will remarck no ſinne in them, in whome I ſee the Sonne of God, obſeruing no other thing of him in this life but his moſt precious bodie and bloud which they conſecrate, receaue and only adminiſter vnto others. And will aboue althinges reuerence and honour theſe ſacred myſteries and beſtow thē in precious places. As alſo I haue euer reuerenced the holy name of God, &amp; in whatſoeuer papers I haue foūd it written, in vnſeemely places I haue gathered it vp, and doe pray euery one to doe the like, and to

putt the papers in honeſt places. I deſire alſo that all diuines be honoured, ſuch as teach the diuine worde, as they who truely giue vs the ſpiritt and life. Beſides I beſeech you to referre your ſelues entierly into the handes of the diuine mercie, who as he hath taught me to liue according to the forme of his holy goſpell, will ſhew you the like, if you follow the rule which his diuine Maieſtie hath cauſed me to preſcribe in breife and ſimple wordes, confirmed afterwardes by his holy vicar on earth. Now all they that preſented themſelues to liue in this Order, diſtributed their goodes vnto the poore, as the ſaid rule doth import, they contented themſelues with one coat, peiced without and within, and with a corde to girde them, with the linnen breeches, and we would haue no more. We haue for a time liued in this ſort, praying in deuotion, the Preiſtes ſaying their office, according to the vſe of our holy mother the church, and we the lay Brethren in our ſimplicity, ſubiecting our ſelues to all for the loue of IESVS CHRIST, and endeauouring to gaine our liuing with the labour of our handes. Now I beſeech you ſo to doe alwayes. And if there be any ignorant, lett thē learne and exerciſe themſelues, not vnder hope of gaine, but to giue good example and to ſhunne idlenes: and if ſuch ſuffice not to ſuſtaine you, I will that you haue recourſe to the moſt abondant table of our Lord IESVS CHRIST: that is, to demaund almoſe att the dores, alwayes giuing the benediction which God att firſt reuealed vnto me, to witt: The peace of God be in this houſe, and in all them that dwell therin: Lett them neuertheles take heed that they receaue nothinge as proper to themſelues: for neither will I that there be receaued in common either houſe or church, that may be tearmed ours, but as ſhalbe agreable to the pouertie and ſimplicity of our Order, which we promiſe to God in our vowes: But lett vs all continue in this life as true pilgrimes and ſtraungers. I command all vnder obedience, that in what ſoeuer place they be, they doe not preſume to demaund any kinde of priuiledge, or exemption from the court of Rome, either themſelues or any perſon in their behalfe, for their Churches or other places, neither vnder apparence of intention to preach, nor as being perſecuted in their bodyes: but if they cannot obſerue their rule, in ſome one place, lett not their demaund be therfore admitted, but lett them goe other where to doe penance with the benediction of God. I was alwayes reſolute to obey the Generall of this Order, and the Guardian that haue bin conſtitued ouer me ſince I renounced the chardge, in ſuch ſort as I would neuer attempt to make choice of my reſidence, nor to doe any thing without his licence, becauſe he is my maſter, And although I be ſimple and infirme, I would alwayes haue a Clerck to performe vnto me the diuine office as the rule importeth. I will likewiſe that all the

other Religious be obedient to the Generall, to the Prouinciall and Guardian, and that they all read their office according to the rule. And if any one be euer ſo hardy as to preſume to alter the office, or to hold opinion contrarie to the holy Catholike Romane Church, I will that all the other Religious in whatſoeuer place they be, ſhalbe obliged by obedience to apprehend him and committ him to ſecure ga
                        •
                     d, and ſo ſend him to the Prouinciall or Generall, who ſhall preſent him to our Protectour in ſuch ſort as he may not eſcape: and he ſhall giue him puniſhment according to his deſert. And lett none affirme this to be a new rule: for it is onlie a remembrāce and an exhortation which I poore Brother Francis leaue you as a teſtament, that the ſaid rule may better and more Catholikely be obſerued; And becauſe I will that the miniſter generall, with the other miniſters and Guardians be obliged not to adde nor ſubſtract from theſe wordes, but that this my teſtament be putt with the rule, and be read to my Brethren, Preiſtes and laitie: I doe further commaund all vnder obedience, that none preſume to gloſe vpon the rule nor this preſent teſtament, affirming, that it muſt be vnderſtood after ſuch or ſuch manner: but as God hath made me vnderſtand it ſimplie, lett them alſo vnderſtand it ſimply without gloſe, and lett it be conſerued perpetually to the end. And I beſeech the omnipotent goodnes, that all they who ſhall religiously and exactlie obſerue theſe thinges, may here on earth be filled with the benediction of his Beloued Sonne, with the holy Ghoſt the Conforter, and with all the bleſſed Angels and Sainctes: and afterwardes on high in heauen with the benediction of the moſt ſoueraigne celeſtiall Father. And I Brother Francis, your wretched and vnworthy ſeruaunt in our Lord, giue my benediction to thoſe that ſhall obſerue it, as I haue formerlie ſaid in the behalfe of God the Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and SS. of God in heauen and in earth; in the name of the moſt ſoueraigne Father, of his beloued Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt the Conforter, So be it, Amen.
                  
               
               
                  Of the ſupper which the glorious Father S. Francis made with all his children and of the last benediction which he gaue them.
                  THE LXIX. CHAPTER.
                  AFter he had made this laſt teſtament, his ſicknes ſo encreaſed that his preſent death was generallie expected, but encourageing himſelfe in God, he called all the Religious that were in the Monaſtery, who being come and perceauing that the holy Father intended to giue them his laſt benediction, they fell all on their

knees, bathing the earth with their teares, and thundering out loud cryes and ſighes towardes heauen. S. Francis with a melted hart wept together with them, and he ſeemed to haue recouered ſome litle part of his ſight; and ſo laying his hand on their heades by one and one, and firmely beholding them, he bleſſed them, then afterward he began to bleſſe them all together, as well the preſent as the abſent, and all thoſe that ſhould enter into his holy Religion; lamenting that he could not haue them all preſent, in regard of his extreme loue vnto them, which exceeded that of a mother towardes her children, himſelfe alſo hauing engendred them in IESVS CHRIST: And the more to comfort them, he cauſed bread to be brought which he diuided in pieces, in imitation of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and gaue to each a piece, bidding them to eat it for his loue att this his departure. Then were there teares redoubled, many of them did not eat all their portion, but did reſerue ſome part therof, which afterwardes was effectuall in reſtoring deſired health to ſuch as were diſealed: which done, this holie Father for his laſt aduertiſement, recommended that holy place to his Vicare Generall and to all the reſt, admoniſhing them neuer to abandon it, but that if they were extruded att one dore they ſhould enter in att an other, alleadging that the place was holie, and the true habitation of God, of the glorious Virgin Marie, of the Angels and Sainctes of the liuing God, and that therfore they had ſo miraculouslie multiplied there, where they had bin illuminated in his ſeruice for the ſaluation of ſo many ſoules; wherfore he doubted not but whatſoeuer ſhould in that place be demaunded of his diuine maieſtie, with a pure and contrite heart, ſhould alwayes be obtayned, who alſo would not faile greiuously to chaſtice ſuch as ſhould offend in that ſacred place, being the true habitation by grace of the celeſtiall Court, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt.
               
               
                  Of the bleſsed and glorious death of the holy Father S. Francis.
                  THE LXX. CHAPTER.
                  THe fourth of October, in the yeare 1226. vpon a Saterday in the euening twenty yeares after his Conuerſion, and the fiue and fortieth of his age, the holy Father hauing bin verie aptly cutt, ſquared and accommodated by the hard ſtroakes of tribulations, temptations, afflictions, incommodities, and infirmities, as a liuelie and firme ſtone, that ſhould be placed in the principall corners of the ſupreme Citty of the celeſtiall Hieruſalem, he heard the voice

of his ſweet Lord that called him vnto him. Then to make publike manifeſtation that he had not any thing in this world, and with the more facility to wreſtle againſt his furious aduerſary in this laſt conflict and triall, wherin conſiſted the crowne, he with an exceeding feruour andS. Francis before his death ſtript him ſelfe all naked. courage ſtript himſelfe all naked, as he had bin without any infirmity, then caſt himſelfe on the ground, couering with his left hand, the precious wound of his right hand, and tourning his ioyfull face towardes the kingdome whither he was to goe, he began to prayſe and bleſſe his ſweet lord IESVS CHRIST, that being diſchardged and freed of all worldly impedimentes, he might aſcend to heauen and enioy his diuine Maieſtie; then tourning towardes his Religious, he ſaid vnto them: My deere Brethren, I haue to this preſent done what I ought to doe; Theſe wordes were diuerſely vnderſtood of the Religious, ſome of them wept in regard he was to leaue them without Paſtour and gouernour, others, becauſe he ſeemed to leaue them as men forlorne, others, for other occaſions; only the Guardian, whome he obeyed, vnderſtood the deſire of the holy Father; wherfore taking preſentlie an habitt with the cord and linnen breeches, brought and gaue it vnto him, ſaying: Father take this habitt which I lend you, with the corde and breeches, that you may be buryed therwith as a poore creature, who of your ſelfe haue not ſo much as wherwith to couer your nakednes: I command you to receaue it in this your laſt houre, euen by the vertue and meritt of obedience; wherof the Sainct diſcouered to haue the greateſt contentment that can be imagined, conſidering that in this extremity he had obſerued his holy pouerty, in ſuch ſort as he deſired euen to the laſt end: He contentedlie accepted the breeches, but to conforme himſelfe entierlie to his truely-beloued IESVS CHRIST that would dye naked on the croſſe, to the performance wherof wanting nothing but to dye naked, hauing already bin, and euen for the preſent being admirably crucified by the vertue of the almighty, he commaunded his Religious, not only to permitt him to dye on the ground, but euen to leaue him there a long time after his death. Hauing procuredS. Fran. receaueth the holy Sacraments before his death. to be brought vnto him the holy Sacramentes, and they being ſucceſsiuely adminiſtred vnto him, thoſe I meane which the Church accuſtometh to afford ſuch as are ready to dye, he laſtly tourned towardes his Religious, to whome he made a worthy ſermon, exhorting them to the loue of God, then of their neighbour, and eſpecially to obedience vnto his holie Romane Church, next to obſerue their pouerty, and before the ſame and all other thinges, to be alwayes mindfull to preferre the obſeruance of the holy ghoſpell, and the diuine counſailes therof. Then croſsing his hādes, this great Patriarch of the poore gaue his holy benediction to all his Religious, both preſent and abſent, ſaying: My

                     deere Brethren, God of his mercy bleſſe you, as alſo I bleſſe you, be itAnd gaue his holy and laſt benediction to his Religious. his holy will to confirme me it in heauen. Remayne ye all in his holy feare, perſeuering alwayes therin; for the time of afflictions approach, wherin they ſhalbe happy who ſhall perſeuer euen to the end: remayne ye all in his holy obedience, as you haue ſolemnely promiſed vnto him. Finally remayne ye all in his moſt holy peace, and in charity among your ſelues, God bleſſe you. I goe in great haſt vnto God, to whoſe grace I recommend you, Amen. Which hauing ſaid, he asked for the goſpell, and ſpeaking no more to any perſon, he only deſired that place to be read vnto him where is mentioned the departure of our lord: Ante diem feſtum paſchae: which being read to the end, he began to ſay to himſelfe:The death of S. F. the 45. yeare of his age the 20. of his conuerſion, &amp; of our Lord the 1226. 
                     Voce mea ad Dominum clamaui. And being come to the verſe, Educ de custodia animam meam, that is, deliuer my ſoule if thou pleaſe my God out of this priſon, that it may attaine to thee my God and my lord, where the iuſt expect me, to the end thou mayeſt giue me my recompence. Which being ended this holy ſoule, at it deſired, was deliuered out of the priſon of her proper fleſh, and eleuated to heauen, there foreuer to enioy the eternall bounty, with all the ſainctes his elected of both ſexes, in that degree which his diuine maieſtie ordayned and parepared for him.
               
               
                  How ſome ſaw the ſoule of the glorious Father ſainct Francis aſcend in glory.
                  THE LXXI. CHAPTER.
                  
                     The ſoule of B. Angelus accompanieth that of S Fr. into glory. He appeared to the Biſhop of Aſsiſium preſently after his death. THis holy ſoule failed not to appeare to ſome when it aſcended to the celeſtiall glory: For Brother Angelus a Religious of worthy ſanctity, being att that time prouinciall of the prouince of Naples, and very neere his end, ſaw in an inſtant the ſoule of the ſainct as a reſplendant ſtarre on the toppe of a verie bright cloud, to be tranſported aboue the great waters, and directlie mounted and eleuated into heauen. And albeit he had the ſpace of two dayes loſt his ſpeech, he neuertheles then reſumed his ſpirittes; for ſeeing the bleſſed ſpiritt of the ſainct, he began to crye out: Stay for me Father, ſtay for me, for I goe alſo with you. The Religious asking what he meant therbie; See you not, ſaid he, our holie Father ſainct Francis that now goeth to the glory of Paradice? which hauing ſpoaken, he yelded his ſoule to God, and followed his moſt holy Father. The Biſhop of Aſſiſium being gone in pilgrimage to viſitt the Church of S. Michael the Archangell, on the mount Gargan, S. Francis appeared vnto him the very night of his death, and ſaid: My lord, know that I haue left the

world and goe to heauen. The Biſhop therfore being riſen, told hisViſion of the paſſadge of the ſoule of S. Fr. vnto glory. people that S. Francis was dead the night before, which was proued to be true. An other Religious of this Order, being the ſame night rapt into deep contemplation, ſaw the bleſſed Deacon of IESVS CHRIST veſted with a very rich tunicle, accompanyed with a great multitude of ſoules that attended him as a worthy Prince, who ſo aſcended into a pallace of merueillous beauty and eminency; it is piously beleeued, that the ſaid ſoules were by his merittes deliuered out of Purgatory. This glorious ſoule aſcended to glory accompanied with many Angels, that attended and viſited him continually in this life, and is now ſeated among the Seraphins, which glory he merited not only in this life, by the exceſsiue and Seraphicall loue of God, but alſo it appartayned vnto him in regard of the Seraphicall viſion of IESVS CHRIST, who transformed him into himſelfe, making him a Seraphin by gtace, and ſealing the ſame with diuine ſeales, as hath bin reuealed to many holy perſonnes worthy of creditt, as well during the life of the Sainct, as after his death: The verie birdes, and particulerlie the Larckes that were much beloued and verie familiar vnto him, did exceedinglie reioyce att his glorie, a great flight of them appearing verie earlie the next morning on the roufe of the houſe where ſainct Francis lay dead, warbling a verie delightfull and extraordinarie note, yea as it were miraculous, which continued diuers howers, celebrating the prayſes of their glorious Sainct, and giuing teſtimonie of his glory.

                     THe bleſſed paſſadge of S. Francis was alſo reuealed to Father Chriſtopher, who was preſent att the Chapter of Arles in Prouence where S. Antony of Padua preaching, S. Francis appeared in the aire, in forme of a croſſe, being yet aliue, and dwelling in Italy; the apparition was in this manner: The ſaid Father being in the borrough of Marulo in the biſhoperick of Cardoua, he ſeemed in dreaming to be att the dore of a houſe wherin S. Francis lay ſicke, and hauing knocked, he was by commandement of the Sainct admitted entrance, in whoſe preſence comming, he demaunded his benediction, which the Sainct very graciously gaue him; and being about to depart, he ſaid vnto him: Retourne my ſonne into thy prouince, and tell my brethren, that I haue performed the courſe of my life, and now doe goe to heauen: the ſaid Father Chriſtopher in the morning recounting this viſion to the Religious, it afterwardes appeared

that the holie Father S. Francis att that verie hower, departed out of this life vnto the other.
                  
               
               
                  Of the beauty and ſplendour of the ſacred body of the holy Father ſainct Francis, and of the great concourſe of people that from euery part repaired to ſee him.
                  THE LXXII. CHAPTER.
                  THe bleſſed Father S. Francis being the ſeruant and friend of the omnipotent, was Founder and Captaine of the Religion of the Frere Minors, a moſt ſinguler profeſſour of pouerty, a patterne of patience, proclaimer of the truth, a mirour of ſanctitie, and finallie the pourtraiture of perfection, according to Euangelicall doctrine; mounting by aſsiſtance of diuine grace with a due ordered and meaſured progreſſe, from vertue to vertue, from meaner matters to ſuch as were more high and ſublime, as one that became rich by pouerty, high exalted by humility, liuing eternallie by mortification, moſt prudent by ſimplicity, ſhining and reſplendant by his honeſty. For which cauſe God would alſo illuſtrate this his ſeruant with an extraordinarily glory and ſplendour after his death, preſeruing his body entier, incorruptible, pure and ſhining, in ſuch ſort as he ſeemed to haue giuen in him in this world a perfect patterne of the generall reſurrection when our fleſh ſhall riſe againe for euer incorruptible and immortall. There were ſeene the ſaid ſacred ſtigmates in his handes and feet engrauen by the ſupreme artiſan, after an admirable and incredible manner: for the nailes were in ſuch ſort framed of his proper fleſh, that drawing them one the one ſide, the ſinowes and arterye vaynes yelded, as alſo on the other ſide the ſaid arteries would ſtretch with a miraculous artifice. The like may be ſaid of the feet: the ſacred wound of the ſide was in forme rather round then otherwiſe; and of couler vermillion reſembling a naturall roſe, and all the other fleſh that was naturallie browne and very hard by meanes of diſciplines and inconueniences paſt, became in an inſtant, white, bright, ſoft and delicate as the fleſh of a tender child. There was not ſeene ouer all his bodie (which to each one repreſented the firſt innocencie, and ſecond natiuity to come by reſurrection in glory) any other blacknes then the heades of thoſe bleſſed nayles, which yet was a blacknes that equaled the ſplendour of a glittering ſtarre. In which reſpect it is not to be admird if his ſpirituall children themſelues, knew not which paſsion in them was grater, either the greife of the loſſe of

their holie Father, or the preſent conſolation to haue had ſuch and ſo excellent a Father, whome, by ſo many manifeſt ſignes they might aſſuredly know not to haue abandonned them, but euen being in heauen did alwayes behold gouerne &amp; aſsiſt them. And doubtles the eminencie of this rare miracle, was ſufficient to breake the moſt obdurate &amp; obſtinate heart, and to mollifie and ſoften it as waxe, with contrition and faith towardes God. The death of the holy Father being diuulged ouer Aſsiſium, and the neighbour places, there reprayred ſuch a concourſe of people to ſee his glorious body, that it was impoſsible to reſiſt them. Wherfore it was conſulted &amp; cōcluded not to admitt entrance vnto any, but to thoſe of Aſsiſium and ſuch as could not with ciuill curteſie be denyed, who entring att their eaſe, beheld and handled att their pleaſure the bleſſed ſtigmates of this holy ſeruant of God. Among other there arriued a noble man called Hierome natiue of Aſsiſium a learned man and of great authority, who as an other Thomas, doubting of the ſacred ſtigmates before he ſaw them, could not ſatisfie himſelfe with tourning and retourning his handes and feet, &amp; to moue hither and thither the hard nayles: and the more he conſidered the matter, the more he admired: therfore with his incredulitie he teſtified this truth to all the aſſemblie; ſo that the holie Father was rightlie inſpired of God, when he commanded the Religious to leaue his body naked a long time on the ground: that this ſo ſinguler grace of God might be manifeſted. The Religious and people there preſent ſpent that night in prayſes and pſalmes, offering infinite thanckes to God, ſo that this watch might rather be eſteemed, a feaſt of celeſtiall Angels, then humane funerals.
                  
                     Of the ſtature and naturall qualitie of the body of the glorious Father S. Francis, extracted out of the thirtieth chap. of the tenth booke, and here inſerted in due place.
                     WE haue thought it conuenient after the diſcourſe of the ſplendour of the body of this glorious S. for the ſatisfactiō of many, to decipher all the other naturall qualities therof. The glorious Father S. Francis then, was of a meane ſtature, and rather litle then great, he had his head round, his vilage longe, a full forehead, black and modeſt eyes, with black beard and haire, he had a ioyfull and ſweet countenance, his noſe correſpondantlie protioned, litle eares, his fleſh broune, his tongue ſharpe and quicke, a voice cleare, ſweet, vehement in deliuery, and elegant in vtterance, his teeth white, litle, and equall; he was by nature indifferentlie leane, and of a moſt delicate complexion, of a worthy ſpiritt, prompt and readie

memorie, and of litle sleepe. To conclude, he was expert, dilligent, liberall and meeke in conuerſation, and verie diſcreet in accommodating himſelfe to the behauiour of others. Wherfore after his conuerſion vnto God, he was moſt holy among the holy, and moſt humble and abiect among ſinners, but almoſt alwayes ſtrictlie vnited vnto IESVS CHRST, in ſuch ſort that whoſoeuer beheld him eſteemed him a man of an other world.

                     THe Abbot Ioachim, who liued more then an hundred yeares before S. Francis, thus propheſied of him: Veniet nomo inſignitus characteribus Ieſu Chriſti. that is: There ſhall come a man adorned and enriched with the woundes of our Lord IESVS CHRIST: he left his image naturally drawne att Veniſe in the church of S. Marck, ſuch as we haue formerlie deſcribed, and with ſtigmates enameled after the Moſaicall manner.

                  THE LXXIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe afore mentioned Lady Iaqueline of the Seauen Sunnes, was the laſt that could not be ſatisfied with ſeeing and touching as an other Magdalen, this ſacred body of her deere maſter; She did nothing but bath it with her gracious teares and dry it with her kiſſes: the extreme ſwetnes that proceeded from this holie body, but particulerlie from the ſacred ſtigmates, exceeded all other ſweetnes: neuertheleſſe ſhe held her eyes alwayes fixed on the wound of his ſide, wherto ſhe often applyed her mouth and handes, whence ſhe receaued ſuch and ſo exceeding conſolation, that it ſeemed vnto her in this conuerſationThe lady of the Seauen Sunnes as an other Magdalen annoynted the body of S.

Butt to the cittizens of Aſsiſium that deſired to carry him to buriall, finding much delay, euery hower ſeemed an hundred, by reaſon of the extreme feare they had that ſo precious a treaſure, by ſome extraordinarie accident might bē taken from them: wherfore they placed a guard before the monaſterie gate, and ſoldiers diuided through the ſtreet euen to the gate of the citty, which cittizens ſo importuned the ſaid Lady, that ſhe annoynted him with precious iontment, then cloathed him in a new gray habitt which ſhe had expreſly

brought from Rome, according to the aduertiſement of the Angell, and the Religious ſo opened this habitt, that the wound of his ſide might eaſily be ſeene. This glorious Sainct did alwayes in his life time deſire that his bodie ſhould be buryed in the baſeſt place of all the citty of Aſsiſiū, his hart excepted, which he deputed to our Lady of Angels,He was enterred as he deſired in the place of executiō being the moſt abiect of the citty. as during his life he had by affection there ſetled the ſame, and in deed God did not fruſtrate him of this iuſt deſire: for his holy body was enterred (though this were not till foure yeares after, by reaſon that the monaſterie was not yet build there, nor the church which they ſumptuouslie built there afterward) in the moſt abiect place of Aſsiſium where malefactours were executed, called the mount of hell; the common opinion is that his hart is in the chappell of S. Mary of Angels, where, according to report, it is preſerued with great reuerence. On the ſonday morning, all the people being aſſembled with bowes of trees, and the Religious, Preiſtes, and Gentlemen with their burning torches and lightes, carryed this holie bodie as in proceſsion, firſt to the Church of S. Damian, to S. Clare, that the propheſie of the Sainct might be accompliſhed, ſending her worde ſome dayes before that ſhe ſhould ſhortlie ſee him, to her exceeding conſolariō. The grate being opened, the body of the Sainct was brought in to the Religious, who were ſo comforted therwith, that greife couldHow S. Clare ſaw the body of S. Franc. finde no place in their hartes, particulerly in that of S. Clare, who endeauouring in vaine to pluck out a nayle of his handes, to keep it with her as a relique, ſhe began againe with her Siſters to bath this holy bodie with teares, encourageing themſelues together to proceed in the way begun of the croſſe of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST which he had taught them. And ſo after they had reſtored this holie▪ bodie to the people, who weare troubled att this long attendance, they carryed it to be enterred in a new ſepulcher within the Church of S. George, as in a diſpoſitorie, where it remayned full foure yeares vnder guard; till his church was builded att the Mount of hell as aforeſaid. It was not without myſterie that he repoſed in the ſaid church wherin he had bin baptiſed, had learned his firſt letters, and where he had deliuerd his firſt preachinges, therfore it ſeemed verie reaſonable that his bodie ſhould begin to repoſe in that place, whither the ſaid Lady of the Seauen-Sunnes, repayred neuer to abandon him, forſaking her habitation in Rome, and neuer left this body till her death when ſhe went for euer to dwell with his bleſſed ſoule in Paradiſe.
               
               
                  
                  How the glorious Father Sainct Francis Was canonized by Pope Gregorie the ninth.
                  THE LXXIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe merittes and glorie of the holie Father S. Francis began by his great miracles to be diuulged, whence ſucceeded that himſelfe raigning in heauen, his ſanctitie was alſo by diuine power manifeſted here on earth, which he had neuertheleſſe alredy made ſufficientlie apparant to the world in his life, directing an infinite number of ſoules in the infallible way of vertue. The brute of the admirable thinges which God wrought by his ſeruant Francis came euen to the eares of Pope Gregorie the ninth, who reſting aſſured that the S. was glorified with God, not only in regard of the ſaid miracles wrought after his death, but euen of the experience had with his owne eyes; deſiring here below to comforme himſelfe to the will of God as his true Vicar, he determined with a pious and deuoted zeale to canonize him, and propoſe him to the world for a remarckeable example of ſanctity, and to take all ſcruple from the Cardinals and others, he cauſed all his principall miracles to be examined and approued by actes of publike Notaries, and infinite teſtimonies worthie of beleife. So the Cardinals and all the principall diuines of his Court being herein dulie aduertiſed, concluded that it was iuſt and verie expedient vnto the Church of God, to canonize this glorious Sainct his ſeruant. The yeare 1228. the Pope himſelfe went with his Court to Aſsiſium expreslieS. Fr. was canoniſed a yeare and nine months after his death by the ſame Pope att Aſsiſium. with this reſolution, and the ſixteenth of Iulie, a yeare and nine monethes and halfe after the death of this glorious Sainct vpon a Sonday morning his holines, with manie ceremonies and great ſolemnitie, inſcribed the bleſſed Father ſainct Francis in the catologue of the ſainctes; and before they departed thence, his Church was begun to be built in the ſaid citty, and in the foundation therof the Pope himſelfe, in preſence of an infinite multitude of people, laid the firſt ſtone, and thenceforward the place which was called the Mount of hell, was nominated the mount of Paradiſe.
                  
                     
                     The bulle of canonization of the holy Father S. Francis, extracted out of the fift chapter of the tenth booke, and here more aptly placed.

As the veſſels of gold which S. Iohn ſaw full of perfumes, (which are the prayers of SS.) powred out moſt ſweet odours before the moſt high, to deſtroy the corruption of our ſinnes: we alſo beleeue that it is a great furtherance to our ſaluation, with great reuerence to haue memory of his ſainctes on earth, and with ſolemnity to publiſh the merittes of thoſe whoſe aſſiſtance by their continuall interceſsions we hope for in heauen. Knowing therfore right well the conuerſion, life and merittes of the holy Father S. Francis, Inſtitutour and Gouernour of the Order of Freer Minors, yea by our owne experience, and by the teſtimony of others of moſt worthy creditt, who haue ſeene the notable miracles which God by meanes of him hath wrought: we are likewiſe aſſured that he is glorified in heauen, his life and apparant renowne diſsipating the obſcuritie of ſinners, that liue and haue liued in the ſhadow of death both men and women: for corroboration of the faith of the holy church, and to the confuſion of the malice of heretikes, the contentment of a great nomber of them that haue and doe follow him, yet floriſhing and leading a celeſtiall life.

                     COnſidering that we haue diſcourſed of the canonization of the glorious Father S. Francis, performed by Pope Gregory the ninth, it ſeemeth to the purpoſe to ſett downe what alſo concerneth the ſaid Pope, touching the familiarity and deuotion which he euer carryed towardes this glorious S. and his Order, and the propheſie wherby S. Francis often reuealed vnto him that he ſhould attaine to the dignitie of the Papacie. His holineſſe being yet Cardinall of Hoſtia,Pope Gregory the 9. being Cardinal would become a Frere Minor. and Protectour of this Order, had euer a perticuler deuotion to his Religion; ſo that diſcourſing once together he ſaid vnto him; I beſeech you Father for the loue of IESVS CHRIST tell me freely your opinion: for I am determined to obey you in that you ſhall reſolue me: which I promiſe you and call God to witneſſe: to witt, whither I ſhall liue in this dignity, or ſerue God in your Religion, leauing the world and vanities therof, and be cloathed in your habitt. Which S. Francis hearing, and conſidering what a beneficiall member he was vnto the church, anſweared, that on the one ſide he might doe the Church of God andS. Franc. fortold and propheſied to Pope Gregory the 9. that he shold be Pope. This Pope ſometimes cloathed himſelfe in habitt of a Frere Minor &amp; vnknown did his deuotion among them. the world good ſeruice in this preſent eſtate, conſidering that he was a man of great experience, very prudent and iudicious of Counſaile, and on the other ſide being ſuch and in ſuch dignity in the Church, and thē

But a little after knowing by diuine reuelation that he ſhould be Pope; many occaſions happening of writing vnto him concerning his religion, he thus made the ſuperſcription of his letter: To the future Father of the world the Cardinall, and ſo it came to paſſe: for after the death of Pope Honorius, he was choſen in his place the ſame yeare that the S. dyed.

Wherfore he failed not with his vtmoſt affection to fauour the two Religions of S. Dominick and S. Francis, in ſuch ſort that he canonized this holy Father as we haue ſaid, the ſecond yeare of his Papacie, and S. Antony of Padua, in the ſixt, as in due place ſhalbe mentioned, he alſo canonized S. Dominick the eight yeare of his Papacie.
                  
               
               
                  
                  How the body of the glorious Father ſainct Francis, was transported into his owne church.
                  THE LXXV. CHAPTER.
                  THe yeare of grace 1230. the Frere Minors, being aſſembled att Aſsiſium there to hold their Generall Chapter, when the translation of this holy body was to be made, from the church of S. George into the new church builded to that purpoſe, there repaired an infinite multitude of people from all partes of Italy, and many further remote to ſee this precious body. But brother Helias, who by the fauour and aſsiſtance of the Pope and many ſeculer gentlemen (though Brother Iohn Parēt were Miniſter Generall) cauſed the holy body without priuity of the ſaid Generall or other persōne to be ſecretly remoued, permitting none ſauing only certaine of his freindes to know where it repoſed; which he did for certaine humane conſiderations. And this exceedingly diſquieted the ſaid Religious, who came, rather to ſee the holy body, then to hold the Chapter. Brother Helias ſatisfied them with very few, yet witty wordes; ſo that this notwithſtanding, the ſaid translation was celebrated with a very ſumptuous ſolemnity; the Pope hauing expresly ſent thither his Apoſtalicall Noncioes as well to make his excuſe of not comming in perſon, by reaſon of certaine lawfull impedimentes, as alſo to adorne that new church with a great croſſe of gold enriched with many precions ſtones, wherin was ſ
                        •
                     tt a litle peice of the true croſſe, and alſo with many dreſsinges and veſſels to trimme and decke the high altare and many other rich ornamentes; and withall a good almoſe to defray the ſaid translation, and towardes the finiſhing of the ſaid building then halfe erected. His holines by Apoſtolicall authoritie exempted▪ the ſaid church, as alſo his monaſtery from all the landes ſubiect to the Romane Church, and would that it ſhould be immediately ſubiect to the holy Sea, himſelfe hauing there laid the firſt ſtone. Now this holy treaſure being translated and tranſported, thus ſealed with the character of the omnipotent, it pleaſed his diuine maieſty by meane of his ſeruant to worck many miracles: therby to induce the faithfull by feruent imitation to follow his ſteppes: conſidering that during his life he had bin ſo deere vnto him, as that by contē
                     plation he had tranſported him as Enoch into Paradice, and as Elias had bin carryed away on a fiery chariott, by reaſon of his feruēt zeale of charity: he in like ſort made him famous on earth after his death (as in the third book ſhall appeare) curing the deafe, the blinde, maymed and leapers, by his merittes expelled deuils from the bodies of the poſſeſſed,

looſed impriſoned captiues, deliuered women in trauaile and child-bed, helped all ſortes of diſeaſes, as alſo trauaillers by ſea, that were deliuered ſafe and ſound from the depth of the Ocean, in the time of horrible tempeſtes, which diſaſter by their ſinnes they had deſerued; finally rayſing the dead, as in his life time he had reduced many to diuine grace: In ſuch ſort that God made him to be alwayes preſent with the vertue of heauen, vnto ſuch as with an ardent faith did inuocate him, whome he freed of all their dangers, to the praiſe and glorie of his diuine Maieſtie, and of his glorious ſeruant ſainct Francis.
                  
                     Here enſue many apparitions and miracles of the holy Father S. Frācis wrought after his death, with a catologue of his vertues, for which he merited ſuch notable guiftes of his diuine Maieſtie. This was diſperſed throughout, but the translatour hath collected it &amp; here placed it as in place proper &amp; perticuler to S. Francis.
                  
                  
                     And first of an admirable manner wherin S. Francis appeared to Brother Leo, taken out of the ſixteenth chap. of the ſixt booke.
                     SOme time after the death of the glorious Father S. Francis, Brother Leo, vnable any longer to ſupport the abſence of his deerely beloued Father, began with the moſt affection he could to pray almighty God that he would voutſafe to ſhew him his deere maſter: and to obtaine the ſame, he retired himſelfe into a ſolitarie place where he continuallie perſiſted, faſting, weeping, and afflicting himſelfe. Vpon this occaſion, the holie Father who affected thoſe that were his more internallie being in heauen, then he had done on earth, appeared vnto him exceeding ioyfull and reſplendant, hauing a paire of winges as feathers of gold, the nailes of his feet and handes were as thoſe of an eagle, likewiſe of gold. Brother Leo was filled with ioy and conſolation, yet exceedinglie amazed att the rariety of thoſe feathers and nailes: wherfore hauing done him reuerence and kiſſed his feet and handes, he prayed him to let him vnderſtand what the feathers and nayles might ſignifie. The Sainct anſweared: among manie graces which God hath giuen me, this is one, that I aſsiſt my Religious and ſuch as are affected vnto myne Order: and that I may be inſtantlie preſent att their affections, when they haue recourſe vnto me, and alſo to aſsiſt the carriage of their ſoules to heauen, I haue the vſe of theſe winges and nayles not only to cauſe the deuils to fly, but eu

                     BRother Leo vpon an other time in viſion ſaw preparation to the generall and laſt iudgement of God, in a great feild where the Angels ſounded their trumpettes to aſſemble all the world, and there were inſtantly placed two ladders, that reached euen from the earth to the throne where the ſonne of God was to ſitt; the one was white, the other red: Our Lord incontinentlie appeared in vehement choller, vpon the redladder, theatening as if he had bin greiuously offended. He ſeemed to ſee S. Francis come downe on the ſaid red ladder and call his Religious, whome he animated to preſent themſelues couragiously: att which voice many of his Religious began boldlie to aſcend the ſaid ladder. But how it chaunced he knew not, they all fell to the ground: wherfore S. Francis began to pray vnto God for them, and God ſhewing him his woundes renewed diſtilling out bloud abondantlie, anſweared: Thy Religious haue procured me all this. S. Francis yet deſiſted not to pray him againe to ſhew them mercie: and then called them againe, ſaying: make an other attempt to aſcend, and feare not, nor be you terrified that you haue already fallen: but repoſe confidentlie in God, without diſpaire, and aſcend by the other white ladder; which doeing, they found att the toppe therof the glorious Virgin Mary, who ioyfully receaued them, and procured them all, entrance into Paradiſe.
                  
                  
                     How the glorious Father S. Francis appeared to Iohn de Brenne, king of Hieruſalem, and Emperour of Conſtantinople, whome he cauſed to take his habitt, and to die therein. Taken out of the eleuenth chapter of the tenth booke.
                     THe Count of Vienna, called Iohn de Brenne, was a moſt vailliant knight, and worthy Catholique, he was of the race of Godfry of Bullen, firſt king of Hieruſalem, as himſelfe was alſo crowned within Tyre; the yeare 1
                           •
                        10. he obtayned manie notable victories againſt the ennemies of IESEVS CHRIST: as, againſt the Mores in Syria, and againſt the Soldan of AEgipt, from whome art lenght he tooke Damietta, which afterwardes he loſt againe with all his armie, through default of an Apoſtolicall Legatt that was in his camp. Wherevpon retourning to require helpe of the Chriſtian Princes

of Europe, and paſsing Sicilia, he maryed one of his daughters to the Emperour Federick, the ſecond, vpon condition that he ſhould aſsiſt him in the enterpriſe of the holy land, and for dowry gaue him the title of king of Hieruſalem, together with all the iuriſdiction and authority he had there: thence is it that the kinges of Sicilia haue euer ſince challenged and enioyed this title; but the Emperour did not only not aſsiſt him, but proued his aduerſary; ſo that being in miſerie he entred into the ſeruice of Pope Gregory the ninth, and then contracted amity with the holy Father S. Francis, where God aſsiſting him, he continued not long but was called from Greece to be gouernour of Conſtantinople, where marying an other of his daughters to their Emperour Baudouin, that was yet a childe, he reſigned his Empire vnto him as a worthy protectour and coadiutor, principallie after the ſaid mariage. He gouerned that contry very prudently all the time of his life, which was about ſeauen yeares, and then dying, as hereafter we ſhall relate, he againe reſigned the Empire very peaceable to his Sonne in law. This worthy captaine of IESVS CHRIST, both corporall and ſpirituall, hauing alwayes in memory the end of his life, did very inſtantly demaund of God, that he would pleaſe to inſpire him to end his dayes in this ſeruice and in ſuch ſort as ſhould be moſt acceptable vnto him, wherfore after many prayers, the holy Father S. Francis appeared one night vnto him, hauing in his hand a very poore habitt with the corde and ſandales, and ſaid: Iohn, thou muſt dye with this habitt, wherwith being exceedingly amazed he awakened, yet diſcouered it not to any perſon. The two nightes following, he had againe the ſame viſion, and the third, ſauing that the third time he added that he ſhould not be terrified to conſider or feare his fall againe into miſery: for, that was the habitt of a Religious, and as ſoone as he awaked, calling for Brother Angelus his Confeſſour, diſciple of the holy Father S. Francis and declaring vnto him his viſion, the Religious graciously eucouraged him to take the habitt, wherein he made no difficultie, but ſhewed himſelfe moſt ready, eſpecially being ſurpriſed with a tercian ague that ſodenly aſſaulted him, wherof he dyed very piously with the vtterance of theſe wordes: Almighty God, I now dye contentedly and very willingly, in this poore habitt of a begger, as a puniſhment of ſo many vaine ſuperfluities, wherein, to the great preiudice of my ſoule, I haue exceeded in the worlde: wherfore I humbly beſeech thine infinite bounty to accept this my good will, in regard that thow knoweſt that if I ſhould liue longer, I would neuer forſake this abiect and holy pouerty. This great Prince did by example demonſtrate to all men, that to reiect the vanities and wealth of the world, is not ſo great a diſgrace and ſhame as it is reputed.

                     Of certaine miracles wrought in Spaine by the merittes of the holy Father S. Francis. Taken out of the fourtenth chapter of the tenth booke.
                     
                        S. Franc. cured a tame girle. IN the citty of Girone within the Country of Catalogne, the daughter of a poore woman, about ten or twelue yeares of age, was ſo lamed and benummed in her feet and handes, that ſhe was not only vnable to vndertake any exerciſe, but euen could not feed herſelfee which exceedingly perplexed and annoyed her mother, as wel in regard of her pouerty, as of the trouble ſhe incurred therby. And being one day otherwiſe employed, ſhe forgott to giue her daughter to eat, who att night complayning, her mother as diſquieted anſweared her: Would to God daughter thou wert in heauē, ſith I am ſo troubled to ſerue thee, &amp; that thou canſt doe me no ſeruice againe. The girle tooke theſe wordes ſo greiuouslie, that ſhe would eat nothinge that euening, and remayned all night much afflicted, till ſhe heard it ring to matines att the Church of S. Francis: which made her remember the great miracles which then were wrought by the merittes of S. Francis, and then ſaid with her ſelfe: S. Francis, if that be true which is ſaid of thee, I moſt humbly beſeech thee voutſafe to make farther proofe on me of thy ſanctity freeing my mother and me from ſuch an inſupportable torment and affliction. S. Francis and S. Antony incontinentlie appeared vnto her, cloathed in white, and girded with a cord, ſeeming as white as ſnow: S. Antony tooke her by the feet, and S. Francis by the handes, and lifted her out of the bed, and ſett her on the ground, ſo leauing her entierly cured. When the SS. were departed, the girle ſaid to Sainct Francis, Lord who art thou, that haſt done ſo ſinguler a fauour to my mother and me? Sainct Francis anſweared, that he was the ſame whome ſhe had ſo deuoutly inuocated, and bid her to ariſe, becauſe ſhe was cured: which ſaid, they both diſappeared. The girle perceauing herſelfe to be cured, full of ioy and admiration att the miracle, with a loud voice called her mother, who was abroad with her neighbours, and they hearing a cleare voice, came ſpeedilie to ſee what the matter was. But exceedinglie amazed to ſee her cured, they asked her by what meanes ſhe gott the vſe of her members: ſhe anſweared that recommending herſelfe to Sainct Francis, two Religious appeared vnto her and cured her. The bruit of this miracle was incontinently diuulged ouer all the towne. The biſhop vnderſtanding therof, with a great multitude of people accompanyed the ſaid girle to the Church of the Freer Minors, to giue thanckes

to God and S. Francis for this gracious benefitt. The girle ſeeing the image of S. Francis in the Church, poynting theratt with her hand, ſhe ſaid a loud: behold him that hath deliuered me from the perill of death and cured me. In the citty of Cumbre, in the kingdome of Portugall, the neece of one that was deuout vnto S. Francis and his Order, was playing on the riuer ſide of Modego, and entring into the water, was carryed away with the ſtreame, euen to the middes of the riuer: her vncle with other of her kinred ſeeking her, ſhe was found vpon a ſtone ſafe and ſecure in the middes of the water. Whence being fetchedAnd ſaued a girle fro drowning. with a boat, and asked all the matter, ſhe anſweared that two Religious of S. Francis who her Father the night before had lodged in his houſe, had ſaued her from being drowned. Thus did the holy Father S. Francis requite this his affectionate freind for his deuotion in entertayning his Religious into his houſe.
                  
                  
                     This enſuying is taken out of the twelfth chap. of the tenth booke.
                     THere was a woman in Almania that by the merittes of S. Francis obtayned of God a male childe: this boy playing in the ſtreet and his mother beholding him, as ſhe ſate at the dore of her houſe, there came a poſſeſſed man that audaciouslie and impudentlie attēpted publikely to force this woman, but ſhe ſhifting in to her houſe violently ſhutt the dore againſt him. The poſſeſſed partly perceauing that the mother was eſcaped, tooke the child and with his diuilleſh force rent it in peeces and went his way. The poore mother in meane whileS. Franc. by his merittes reuiueth a diſmembred child. went to the windoe to ſee if her ſonne had no hurt; but perceauing him ſo diſmembred, ſhe filled the aire with ſighes; and comming ſpeedily downe, ſhe aſſembled all the members of her child into her lap, and with a ſtrong faith carryed them to the Church of S. Francis, who a litle before had obtayned him for her, where hauing layd him on the altare; with great courage ſhe vttered theſe wordes. Glorious Sainct that haſt obtained this child forme of God, reſtore him me againe att this preſent I beſeech thee; for I beleeue and hope that his diuine maieſtie will not deny thee ſuch a fauour. This ſtrong faith was not fruſtrated of what it expected, for in an inſtant, the members of the child were miraculously revnited together, and the child reſtored to his life and beauty, to the exceeding admiration and encreaſe of deuotion in all perſons. This miracle remayned a long time pictured in the citty of Bolonia.
                  
                  
                     
                     How S. Francis and S. Antony deliuered a lady from diſpaire. Taken out of the 12. chapter of the tenth booke.
                     IN the kingdome of Portugall, and citty of Liuarez, the lady of the place called Lopez, had for gouerneſſe a deuill, in diſguiſe of a woman, by whoſe counſaile ſhe practiſed moſt horrible cruelties on her ſubiectes, and moſt enormous ſinnes in her ſelfe: but following the cuſtome of moſt women, ſhe was very deuout vnto the SS. &amp; particulerly to S. Francis and S. Antony of Padua. Now ſhe falling greiuously ſick, and by reaſon of her enormous ſinnes committed running into diſpaire, ſhe had no care of ſpirituall phiſicians, nor of other Sacramentes; whervpon the SS. mentioned hauing pitty on her, came to viſitt her, and hauing ſaluted her, began to comfort her, and to perſuade her to be confeſſed; but they litle auayled, for ſhe alleaged that her ſinnes were ſuch &amp; ſo haynous as could not be pardoned. And therfore the elder of the two SS. told her that if ſhe would confeſſe &amp; haue contrition of her ſinnes, he would be contēted to take her ſinnes on himſelfe, and to ſatisfie God for her, yea and would make her participant of all the good deedes he had done during his life, and finally would in the name and part of God promiſe her eternall life. Theſe wordes put her in good hope, whervpon of a wolfe ſhe became a meeke lambe, with exceeding contrition doeing pennance for all her ſinnes; hauing made a generall confeſsion to one of the two: And hauing receaued the holy Sacramentes by their Miniſter, ſhe by their owne handes was veſted in the habitt of the Frere Minors; which done, they diſappeared; they who ſaw them, eſteemed them by their comportment and geſtures, to be S. Francis and S. Antony. A few dayes after their departure, this woman dyed very piously, and commaunded her body to be buryed in the Church of the Freere Minors, ſome league diſtant from the ſaid citty of Liuarez. That very night a foot man of hers retourning from abroad, as the day began to breake, there appeared a ſhaddow before him, and he coniuring it in the name of the liuing God, it anſweared that he was the deuill, that for fourteene yeares had ſerued the lady Lopez in ſhape of a woman: and that by right he had gotten and pourchached her; but that att the end of her life, there preſented themſelues vnto her two Religious wearing the Capuce whome ſhe much affected, who ſo preuailed that they conuerted her to pennance for her ſinnes, and againſt all right, wreſted her ſoule out of his power, and carried it with them vnto glory: But that thou mayeſt know this to be true, (ſaid the deuill) when thou ſhalt come to Liuarez, where ſhe is dead, thou shalt finde a rumour

among the people, by reaſon of a locke-ſmith that had killed his wife, who being taken vpon the fact ſhalbe hanged, and I that haue bin cauſe therof, ſhall gaine their ſoules, and carrie them with me into hell. So that for one ſoule which I haue loſt, I ſhall gaine twoo. The footman endinge his iorney, found what the deuill had told him to be true, and therfore to all perſonnes recounted this diſcourſe.
                  
                  
                     How the mentionned Saintes hindered a woman from hanging her ſelfe. Taken out of the 23. chapter of the tenth booke.
                     AN other woman of Portugall named Sara, being verie deuout to the ſaid Saintes, was cruellie tormented by her huſband; for beſides his queanes which he entertayned in his houſe, the bread and wine which he gaue her were iniuries and baſtonadoes. Now being herevpon one day run into extreme deſpaire, ſhe faſtened a corde about the beame of her chamber, and hauing made a bowe to put about her necke and to hang her ſelfe, ſhe heard ſome rudelie knocke att the dore and calling to haue it haſtely opened, wherfore hiding here corde, ſhe found that they were two Religious, who prayed her to giue them entertaynement for that night in her houſe. She demaunded who they were, and how they were called; they anſweared that they were two-frere Minors of a farre country, the one called Francis, and the other Antony; ſhe preſently replyed, that ſhe would willingly entertaine them for the deuotion ſhe had to S. Francis himſelfe, and to S. Antony; and ſo hauing admitted them, ſhe did accommodate them a chamber wherin to sleep, reſoluing for that night to deferre to hange her ſelfe, for reuerence vnto thoſe ſeruantes of God. But the SS. about midnight appeared to her huſband, and ſaid: God hath ſent vs in his behalfe to aduertiſe thee, that if thou doe not conuert thee from thy ſinnes, ſhake off thy lewd retinue, and liue in peace with thy wife, who is very deuout vnto vs, thou ſhalt die within three dayes, and be buried in hell, ſith thou art cauſe that this euening ſhe would haue hanged her ſelfe, if we had not come to preuent her: ariſe therfore inſtantlie, and in token that this is true, goe ſpeedilie to thy houſe, and aske thy wife for the corde wherwith ſhe would ſtrangle her ſelfe. This miſerable husband, being by theſe wordes full of contrition, went to find his wife in his houſe, who att her riſing miſsing the Religious, was in exceeding admiration, how they ſhould goe foorth ſhee keeping the key of the dore which ſhe opened to her husband, that

then knocked, who humbly demaunding the corde wherwith ſhe would haue hanged her ſelfe that night, ſhe knew not what to anſweare: her husband recounted her all, how ſhe had bin preſeuered by S. Francis and S. Antony, thenceforward ſhe liued with him in peace and piously, to the great contentment of the poore woman, who was very thanckfull to the Sainctes.
                  
                  
                     How the glorious Father S. Francis held a chapter with his Religious in viſion. Taken out of the 18. chapter of the tenth booke.
                     THere was a Frere Minor in Thoſchane, for his owne perticuler of very auſtere life, who being rayſed to gouernement, perceauing many yong gentlemen daily to enter into Religion, and many other other deſirous to enter, if there were place commodious to entertaine them, determined to erect a great and ſumptuous Monaſterie: Which hauing done, he left the litle houſe wherin he formerly reſided. Now the glorious Father ſainct Francis appeared to him one night in viſion, and ſaid: Come with me: he anſweared: whither? and he replyed: to our Monaſtery, goeing towardes the firſt he anſweared that it was ruined. The S. then ſaid, come only with me, I know well whither I am to goe; and ſo following him, he came to a Chapter, where it ſeemed to him that the S. called all the Religious by one and one, and that according to their manner, they confeſſed their faultes vnto him, yea and that he heard ſome to accuſe themſelues of carnall ſinnes, others of diſobedience, others to haue infringed their firſt vowe of pouerty; of whome the firſt and ſecond it ſeemed that the S. with compaſsion pardoned, only admoniſhing them to be wary thē
                        ceforward not to fall into the like, but did cruelly chaſtice thoſe that had tranſgreſſed the vow of pouerty; which this Religious much admiring, moſt humbly prayed the S. to tell him the cauſe. The S. anſweared him, that the rule gaue a ſufficient puniſhment to the laſciuious, and ſuch as diſobey their Superiours, who will enforce them to obedience, therfore it only needeth to admoniſh them in good ſort. But ſaid he, the precious ſtone of my holy pouerty, is now of each one trodden vnder foot, as well the great as litle, eſteeme it contemptible and miſpriſe it, wherfore I muſt my ſelfe redreſſe it: then addreſsing himſelfe to this Religious, and thou, ſaid he, that haſt ſo raſhlie preſumed to build aſumptuous Monaſterie, and to deſtroie mine owne ſo precious and poore, ſhalt not eſcape the wrath of God. But the Guardian in his owne excuſe alleadged that he did it not of himſelfe, and that by the grace of God he affected not thoſe worldlie honours, but had onlie conſented therto for the commodity of other

Religious. Therfore, ſaid he, doeſt thou meritt a double puniſhment, conſidering that being auſtere in thine owne behalfe, and accommodating they ſelfe vnto others; thou doeſt not care to damne thine owne ſoule: which ſaid he vaniſhed. And what after became of the ſaid Guardian is not knowne.
                  
                  
                     How S. Francis appeared in viſion, deciding who were his Religious, and who not, in the preſence of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſitting as Iudge. Taken out of the ſeauententh chapter of the tenth booke.
                     IN the primitiue time of the Order, there happened a very horrible accident on this ſubiect in England; which was thus, there being a Religious of ſainct Francis very contemplatiue, who for the merittes of his deuotions was often rapt into extaſie: his Guardian ſeeing him ſo to remayne a whole day and weeping, ſaid vnto him, I command you brother, vpon holy obedience to retourne to your ſelfe from the extaſie you are in. Hauing heard the word of obedience, he incontinently came to himſelfe, and tooke refection according to his neceſsity: hauing reſumed his ſpirittes, the Superiour commanded him againe vpon obedience to tell him what he had ſeene that cauſed him ſo bitterly to weepe, which ſeemed vnto him meerly extraordinary: for the property of mentall extaſie is to cauſe ioy, and not ſorrow and lamentation. The Religious thus conſtrayned, began to recount vnto him ſaying: O Father, I ſaw our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST ſitting on a very high throne with an incredible Maieſty attended with all his celeſtiall guard to execute his iudgement. Then in an inſtant I ſaw to appeare all degrees of men and women, and ſaw, which I would neuer haue beleeued, many Religious, and many Preiſtes alſo condemned as worldlinges among whome I ſaw a Religious of our Order that had a delicate and ſenſuall habitt, who being demaunded of what Religion he was, he anſweared that he was a Religious of the Order of ſainct Francis. Wherfore the mighty Iudge tourning to S. Francis asked him if it were true that this Religious were one of his. He anſweared that he was none of his Religious, becauſe his woare no habittes ſo fine and ſenſuall, but poore and patched, and ſo the wretch was ſodenly throwne into hell: after him came an other, accompayned with many ſeculer Gentlemen, the S. denyed him alſo to be any of his, affirming that his Religious applyed themſelues to prayer and other ſpirituall exciſes, and not to vaine ſeculer conuerſations, and ſo he was condēned as the other, as alſo the third, becauſe he came with a great quantity of curious bookes: after theſe there came one very expert in contriuing lofty and ſumptuous buildinges, who was ſent for an architect

into hell. Finallie there came one miſerably cloathed and ragged, who fell on his knees, affirming himſelfe to be a wretched ſinner vnworthy of life: but demaunded mercie of God. S. Francis, ioyfullie receaued him into his armes, and conducted him with him into Paradiſe, ſaying to our Lord, this is one of my Frere Minors; and then the viſion diſappeared: now this is the cauſe of mine extraordinary teares.
                  
                  
                     Here enſueth an order of the nine principall vertues of this glorious S. wherby he merited to obtaine ſuch worthy graces of God: Taken out of the ſecond chapter of the third booke.
                     AFter the miracles and apparitions which the holy Father S. Francis made to thoſe that were deuout vnto him, it ſhall not be amiſſe to recount alſo the vertues wherby he merited to obtayne of God ſuch graces and ſo notable giftes, which alſo he daily obtayneth, according to what the bleſſed Brother Iuniperus his diſciple writeth therof. The firſt vertue then was his great contrition, confeſſion, and ſatisfaction for his ſinnes, and his care to auoyd them afterward. The ſecond, was the admirable affection he had towardes his neighbour, and the compaſsion he had of him in effect and in word, and eſpecially in his interiour; in that he eſteemed euery one farre aboue himſelfe, taking for his ground this argument, that hauing offended the ſoueraigne Creatour, who ſo much loued vs, as that for our loue alone he would take on him humane fleſh, he therfore participated himſelfe with euery creature, and ſo did voluntarily obey all, not only his Superiours, equals and inferiours, but, as faire foorth as was lawful and poſsible, all creatures. The third, was a ſeparation of heart, from all terreſtriall and tranſitory thinges; for he was vnited to IESVS CHRIST alone, who had created him, and whome alone he deſired: Wherfore he in ſuch ſort exerciſed himſelfe herein, that it was ſo eaſy for him to ſequeſter himſelfe from terreſtriall thinges, and to haue his ſpiritt alwayes addreſſed vnto God, that it ſeemed his fleſh had the ſame will with his ſpiritt. The fourth, was the incredible pacience wherwith he endured all his afflictions and al the iniuryes that were laid vpō him, endeauouring to loue them that iniuryed him, mortifying his proper ſences, and receauing all as from the hand of God: for as he beleeued that all good proceeded from the diuine liberality, ſo did he beleeue that the affliction which he endured was for his ſinnes, and that God meant to chaſtice him in this lif &amp; not in the other. The fift was his loue vnto the good and the great compaſsion he had of the wicked, reputing himſelfe much leſſe then they; for he would ſay, that the end was not yet ſeene when the good might become wicked &amp; the wicked good. When he heard any one detracted, either he would excuſe him, or would ſhew

that he disliked it, ſo that he would putt the detractour to ſilence, or chaunge the diſcourſe. The ſixt, was that he loued to be reprehended, for which he was verie thanckfull; Neuertheles he was verie vnwilling to reprehend, though he were verie zealous of the honour of God, of the good of his neighbour, and of the obſeruance of the rule; yet to auoide obligation to reprehend, he renounced the office of Generall. The ſeauenth, was that he ſerued each one, with a pure will and very great affection; though he would neuer permitt himſelfe to be ſerued, but in extreme neceſsity; reputing himſelfe vnworthy to be ſerued: alleadging that IESVS CHRIST ſaid, that he came not to be ſerued, but to ſerue, And if any one in any neceſsity ſerued him, he would in his heart giue thanckes to God for giuing will and power to that Religious to ſerue him. The eight was, that he endeauoured to conſerue in his memorie, the graces which he had receaued of his diuine maieſtie, as alſo the vniuerſall benefitts exhibited to al other creatures, for which he was alwayes thanckfull for himſelfe and all others. Att the end of this thanckeſgiuing, he ordinarily accuſed himſelfe, diſcending to the knowledge of himſelfe and aſcending to that of God, reputing himſelfe vnworthy to giue him thanckes, as by theſe wordes he often ſignified: But who am I, that preſume to giues thanckes for others, I, I ſay, that am not able to thanck him for the leaſt grace he hath done me, and am alſo ſuch an abhominable ſinner? The ninth and laſt vertue, was the guard of his tongue, which is the hight of all good, as being the verie gate of life and death, according as it is employed: without the guard wherof all good alſo is loſt. In reſpect wherof he was alwayes very carefull that his wordes ſhould ſauour of truth, humility, pouerty chaſtity, goodnes, benedictiō, prayſe of God and his neighbour: &amp; ſo he merited to be in like ſort bleſſed of God &amp; mē, world without end. Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     How the glorious body of the Seraphicall Father S. Francis, was buryed in the citty of Aſsiſium. This is taken out of the first chapter of the tenth booke, and here placed for concluſion of the ſecond booke.
                     THere is no man but knoweth that the glorious body of the Seraphicall Father S. Francis, is buryed in his owne monaſterie in the citty of Aſsiſium, but yet after an ordinarie manner: for it is not otherwiſe knowne in what place it is in the ſaid church: bnt that it is in a great chappell vnder the earth vnder the high altare, and that lampes are putt in att a windoe to lighten that place where the ſacred body repoſeth, as is alſo reported of ſainct Iames of Galicia, that he is buryed ſo farre vnder ground, that none can come att him. We muſt beleeue that God hath ſo diſpoſed, to the end ſuch precious

treaſures by whoſe merittes it pleaſeth his diuine maieſty daily to work ſuch and ſo great miracles might not be robbed or ruinated by any alteration or diſaſtrous euent of warre or other euill accident. Now we deſiring to content the readers, and not to omitt any matter in this worck that may be deſired and is poſsible to be performed, we haue ſo dilligentlie ſearched and enformed our ſelues, that we haue gotten knowledge that the true relation of what may be deſired concerning this ſubiect, fell into the handes of the great Capitaine Gonzales, Heruandez de Cordoua, in his conqueſt made of Calabria and the kingdome of Naples for his Catholique maieſty, and therfore we haue ſo much Laboured with importunities and induſtrie, that att length we obtayned the ſame, it being this that enſueth, read it with contentment.
                     
                        A true and faithfull diſcourſe wherby appeareth how the glorious Father S. Francis is buryed. translāted out of the latin originall, which fell into the handes of the great Capitaine Gonzales Heruādez de Cordoue, in his conqueſt made of the kingdome of Naples.
                     
                  
                  
                     To the right reuerenced Antony Bishop of Andria, Francis Bancie Duke of Audria, Health.
                     THe charge which it hath pleaſeth you to lay on me, to committ to writing the viſitation which the ſanctity of Pope Nicolas the firſt perſonally made of the glorious body of the Seraphicall Father S. Francis, being on the one ſide ouerburdenſome vnto me in regard of the great feeblenes of my ſpiritt, hath neuertheleſſe for other conſiderations bin very eaſie and contentfull, as well in that this labour is pious and deuout, as becauſe I am to preſent it vnto you; to you I ſay, who were preſent when it was related vnto vs, ſo that you are able to correct it and ſupply that wherin mine endeauour may faile. So I beſeech my ſweet lord IESVS CHRIST, for whoſe prayſe and glorie I haue attempted to dictate this diſcourſe, to afford me the grace worthily to diſchardge my duety herein: I beſeech him I ſay, by the merittes of this glorious S. of whoſe body I am to treat, conſidering that it is not conuenient to burry in ſilence ſo great a miracle, wherin God doth manifeſt ſo great bounty and omnipotencie. Your reuerence and my Lord Iames Biſhop of Laquidonia being with me the eighth day of march, as you conferred together walking and often reſting your ſelues, as the manner is in diſcourſing of ſome admirable accident; I came neere you, and prayed you to make me participant of your

diſcourſe if I were worthy and my requeſt lawfull: the ſaid Lord Iames then ſaid vnto me: My Lord Duke, if you knew wherof we did talke you would alſo admire and wonder. Then did I very inſtantlie entreat him to tell me the occaſion of ſuch admiration. Whereto the ſaid Lord anſweared that he would willinglie doe it: but that he rather deſired to weepe when ſuch thinges are recounted and to heare thē of an other, then to relate them himſelfe. Neuertheles he neither could nor would omitt to content me and leet me know that their admiration was not without ſubiect: conſidering withall that it was a matter worthy to be knowne, but not of all perſons, therfore making me partaker therof, he thus began his diſcourſe. My Lord Duke, you muſt vnderſtand that I was one of the ſeruantes of the deceaſed Euſtergio of worthy and bleſſed memorie, Cardinal of the title of S. Euſebius Archbiſhop of Beneuentum: who approaching to the pangs and agony of death, yea arriuing to that priuation of naturall heat and vigour, that we much feared he could not liue a day: about midnight I heard him with a loud voice to cry: O S. Francis! then ſtaying a while, with groanes and ſighes he redoubled, O Francis! O Francis: wherwith he much amazed vs all: but none of vs durſt approach to aske him to demaund the reaſon for feare to trouble him, but were attentiue to ſee the ſucceſſe of this frequent inuocation. I, that exceedinglie loued him, wept bitterly with him, and for him mentally inuocated the Sainct to whome I haue euer had a particuler deuotion: but this had no other ſucceſſe ſauing that the next morning, when we ſuppoſed to prepare his obſequies, he began to amend: and the phiſitians likewiſe conceaued better hope of him, he hauing alwayes eſteemed me for one of his moſt affectionate ſeruantes, hauing bin then a very ſmall time abſent from the Court, to yeld due reſidence to an Abbey which he had beſtowed on me: knowing well that he had bin with his Holines to viſitt the body of the glorious S. Francis, and deſiring to heare the diſcourſe, as alſo knowing that att other times he had much deſired that I ſhould vnderſtand the ſame, but no occaſion was euer preſented to demaunde it of him: Now taking this occaſion of his frequent inuocation of the Sainct, I began firſt readily to aske him the cauſe, then att lenghth I freelie diſcourſed, and humblie requeſted him breifely to relate vnto me, how he had ſeene that glorious body in his Church. Wherevpon he graciouslie anſweared me in theſe wordes: know Abbot, if thou wert not deere vnto me as I hold thee to be. I would not impart it vnto thee, much leſſe to any man in the world: we that were there preſent hauing expreſſe commaundement of his holines to the contrary: and therfore by reaſon of that prohibition I will not tell thee the place where it is, but am

well content to tell thee what I ſaw. Thou ſhalt then vnderſtand thatPope Nicolas the 5. went expreſly to Aſsiſium to ſee the body of S. Franc. the yeare. 1449. in the yeare 1449. Pope Nicolas the fift, who with an ineſtimable prouidence gouerned the holy Church, goeing for certaine affaires of great importance to Aſſsiſium, or according to the opinions of ſome meerly and expresly to viſitt this glorious body, ſent Sir Peter of Noceſon his Secretary, to giue the Guardian of the place vnderſtanding therof, who aſſembling his Religious communicated vnto him the intention of his holineſſe. Vpon conſultation wherof they were exceedingly buſied, for fearing on the one ſide that his holineſſe would take and tranſport it to Rome: and on the other, not daring to contradict him, they knew not well how to reſolue to anſweare his holines: but that the ſaid Secretary being very prudent and diſcreet, conſidering the anguiſh wherin the Religious were, made anſweare of himſelfe, and retourning to the Pope told him in their behalfe, that none of his predeceſſours not the holy Apoſtolick Sea hauing attempted the ſame, they knew not well how to reſolue, much fearing that he would depriue them of that precious treaſure of their Father: which the Pope vnderſtanding, he retourned his Secretary to ſecure them and putt them out of that doubt. The Religious then accorded that he ſhould freely come about midnight: but moſt humbly beſeeching him to come attended only with two or three perſonnes. A biſhop of Fraunce that was then neere his Sanctity hearing this, was much ſcandalized, ſaying that this was as it were to contradict and to limitte the Apoſtolicall authority: and that if his holineſſe did what thoſe Religious required, it were to giue ill example to the world, and aduiſed him not to endure it. The Pope anſweared him, that hauing good intention, he would not haue it eſteemed euill without ſubiect: and ſo much the rather becauſe they had very great reaſon for it, being alſo requiſite to goe into holy places with great humility, wherby he hoped to obtaine of this S. that, for which he expresly went att that time. And therfore he choſe only the ſaid Biſhop, my ſelfe, and his ſaid Secretary, and commaunded the Guardian to take the like nomber of his Religious to be preſent with him att the ſaid viſitation. Now as we expected the hower, the Guardian preuenting it came about three of the clock att night vnto his holines, and hauing kiſſed his feet conducted him by diuers turninges to a groſſe wall but lowe, whither being come the three Religious which he had brought, began to breake the wall, ſo that thy made a hole fitt for vs to paſſe commodiously through: we then began there to conſider, that vnto the place where the body of S. Francis was, there was a long rew of ſteppes of marble, by which goeing we came co a tombe made in forme of a vault vnder earth, where the Guardian kneeling downe gaue a burning torch into the hand of his holines, that he might

the more ſecurely enter. Att the higher part of the vault we found a dore ſome what lowe, that was of braſſe very ſtrong, hauing three groſſe barres of iron, with their lockes that ſhutt very curiously, and three great chaines of iron that croſſed the dore: which being opened, there iſſued an odour ſo precious and rare, that none of vs either felt or ſhall feele a ſweeter on earth. The Guardian then with his knee on the ground ſaid to his holines, that he might enter att his pleaſure, he entred alone (we remayning without where we diſcourſed of diuers ſpirituall thinges) and falling incontinently to the ground before the feet of the S. he began to ſigh, groane and weep ſo bitterly and ſo ſorely, that ſo perſiſting a good ſpace, we began to feare, that ſome accident had befallen him: We then determined to enter to withdraw him, but that hauing of himſelfe chaunged his lamentation into ioy, which was an euident ſigne that he had obtayned of this glorious S. ſome grace of importance; he called vs all in, deſiring to ſee the ſaid place and to conferre with vs therof, and ſo entring we fell on our knees, and abbreuiating our deuotious to be leſſe troubleſome to his holines, ariſing vp, and lifting our eyes on high we remayned all amazed. O how inſcrutable, freind Abbott, (ſaid the Cardinall) are the wayes, of God! and how diſtant and different are his iudgementes from all humane prudence! who in his life hath euer ſeene or heard of a body ſo many yeares dead, to remayne and ſtand vpright on his feet without any reſt or ſtay? It is no baulme, nor any drith of naturall coldnes, but an only ſupernaturall and euidently diuine vertue, that thus ſupporteth this holy body as if it were liuing, in ſuch ſort as we haue ſeene it. We may well acknowledge that the hand of God is no more abbridged in his behalfe then if he were liuing, ſeeing that he is truely liuing, aliue I ſay in God, aliue in vertues, aliue in miracles, and aliue in image, geſture and and fleſh: ſo that only breath, yea breath alone is wanting. But to tell your particulerly and by order: Know Abbott, that this place is madeThe admirable standing of the body of S. Franc. in forme of a litle chappell with three arched vaultes, that in the middeſt ſeemed to be miraculously made, were it in reſpect of the walles or pauement, hauing in the middeſt a ſtone wheron the glorious body of the S. ſtood vpright on his feet as I haue ſaid, with his face towardes the weſt, &amp; his eyes eleuated towardes heauē, which they very attentiuely beheld as he accuſtomed in his life. His handes were ioyned one in an other within the sleeues of his habitt, after the māner of the Freer Minors, &amp; reſted on his breſt. This body was in all partes as entier and exempt from corruption as the firſt day of his death. On the other ſide of this vault, ſtood an other body likewiſe vpright, and cloathed in the habitt of S. Dominick, who ſeemed to pray with his handes ioyned on high, and his eyes fixed towardes the feet of S. Francis, and

they were ſo liuelie &amp; cleare, that to neither of both there wanted but ſpeech. They yelded ſuch and ſo gracious a ſauour that it could hardlie be ſupported: for it was ſo admirablie ſubtile and penetrant, that it rauiſhed our ſpirittes into extaiſe. Now the Pope hauing well ſeene and duely conſidered all this, fell againe on his knees before the ſaid body of S. Francis, then very reuerently lifted vp one ſide of his habitt, for the other ſide was faſt vnder his foot which he would not pull vp, becauſe it could not conueniētlie be done without ſtirring the whole body: wherfore he contented himſelfe to diſcouer only the other foot, which was all bare without ſandale. O happy were our eyes, that then deſerued to beholdThe ſtigmates of S. Franc. appeared fresh on his body. the ſacred ſtigmates which God himſelfe with his owne handes imprinted in his deerly beloued! Happy doubtles are the vnderſtandinges that can att their pleaſure contemplate them: for the wound was as freſh on the middeſt of ther foot, as if it had bin made att that verie hower, with the hard nayle vpon the bare fleſh: and the bloud appeared exceeding full of life. O happy were the ſoules that were held worthy to ſee in his ſeruant, what they could not ſee in their Lord IESVS CHRIST! and more when afterwardes they ſaw his ſacred handes, which his Holines diſcouered and ſaw pearced as the feet, and hauing alſo the like nailes: we alſo kiſſed them laying our impure lippes onthe ſacred bloud that was yet very freſh: which made vs to poore out teares, that ſo abondantly fell from our eyes, as that they hindered our cōtentment; for we could not taſt nor enioy the ſame according to our wiſh: our eyes were ſo troubled that we often ſaw not that precious treaſure. But who cā euer explicate the motiō of our vnderſtāding, the abſtractiō of our ſpiritt, the melting of our ſences, and the faintnes of our corporall forces, procured by this precious ſight? O thrice happy the mouthes of vs ſo greiuous ſinners, wherwith we were permitted to kiſſe that ſacred wound of his foot, with ſuch interiour cōſolation as none could be more! But ſeauen fold more hapy the Pope who alone kiſſed the wound of his ſide, flowered as a freſh roſe, &amp; conſequētly his very mouth; whervpon he graciously vttered theſe wordes: O moſt worthy &amp; excellēt memoriall of our redemption, wherwith the eternall God would that conformably to our Lord I. C. the glorious Father S. Fr. ſhould be deputed aliue &amp; dead to repreſent to the world, euen till the laſt day of iudgmēt, the ſigne of his dolorous paſsion! O holy woundes firſt endured by the Sonne of God for the ſinnes of men! and after for our benefitt renewed in his holy ſeruant Francis O moſt gracious God! to whome haſt thou euer ſhewē ſuch loue but to this thy moſt faithful ſeruant? Bleſſed ſainct, thou haſt really carryed the triumphant ſtander of the croſſe, together with the liuely marckes of his paſsion. Finally thou alone haſt ben elected and found worthy to be pearced in true imitation of our Lord I. C.

differing from him only in this, that he receaued his woundes of the wicked Iewes, and thou of our Redeemer I. C. O extreme benefite! O ſinguler gift! O ineffable prerogatiue! Fr. who taught thee to ſerue God? in what new ſcoole was it performed? and by what merueillous doctrine? Of what maſter haſt thou learned to moūt to ſo high a degree of perfection, that neuer S. of either ſex could equall thee in the giftes of God? The Pope vttered theſe and many other wordes, being rauiſhed out of himſelfe in the preſence of this S. of God, himſelfe together with vs bathinge the pauement of that holy place with abondance of our teares. Now we ſo perſiſted in theſe ſweet cōceiptes, that whē we leaſt thought theron, one aduertiſed vs that it was neere day, and that it was neceſſary for vs to depart, to ſhutt vp the hole of the ſacred ſepulcher dexteriously which touched our hart as a deadly wound, the ſpace of ſix or ſeauen howers that we were there, ſeeming to haue flowen and not paſſed away. Making therfore ſome litle prayer more, and recommending our ſelues to the S. the Pope firſt goeing out we all followed, but not till we had opened the two vaultes in the two other arches, where we ſaw the two other glorious bodies of his diſciples, entier alſo and very odoriferous, but much leſſe then that of their maſter; hauing their habittes of ſackcloth. Att the entry we ſaw the body of the bleſſed Brother Giles, thenBrother Giles alſo. we came foorth, and the Guardian ſhutt the dores, praying his Holines to keepe the ſame in great ſecreſie: which he promiſed him, and commā
                        ded vs alſo the ſame. This, my freind Iames, was the cauſe of my inuocation that night, when I cryed, O Francis! Francis! hauing yet hope, yea very confident, that he wilbe protectour of my ſoule before God att my departure. But it ſeemeth indeed very admirable that this glorious S. had not procured his recouery, but that he might haue declared this his glory to many his deuoted freindes that much deſired to vnderſtand it: for this diſcourſe ended he began ſo to decay that he dyed the night following, leauing aſſured teſtimony of this truth, conſidering that it is not to be beleeued nor thought, nor is it probable, that aman eſpecially ſuch as this being in the conflictes of death, would for his pleaſure and without occaſiō faine a falſe matter, the time ſo neere when he ſhould moſt ſtricktly render an account vnto God, who ſeuerely condemneth the culpable and ill-deſeruers, as he crowneth the ſainctes, his elected here on earth, but much more in heauen, there glorifiyng their bodies &amp; their ſoules with his glorious viſion eternally; whither I beſeech him by his grace to conduct vs, where he is three and one, and liueth and raigneth world without end. Amen.

                  THE FIRST CHAPTER.
                  
                     TO the honour and glory of almighty God, and the bleſſed Father S. Francis. Being to write certaine miracles of his, wrought after his glorification in heauen, we haue determined to begin with that immenſiue priuiledge giuen him by our Lord IESVS CHRIST, honouring him with the ſigne of the croſſe and paſsion. This glorious Father S. Francis, was then eminent by a new miracle, when he appeared charactered and illuſtrated with ſo ſinguler a priuiledge, neuer before graunted to any creature, I meane the ſacred woundes of our Lord, which made his mortall bodie like to that of IESVS CHRIST crucified, the ſacred ſtigmates conſidered, wherof whatſoeuer any humane tongue can expreſſe, is litle or nothinge in compariſon of ſo

ſublime and worthy a myſtery, wrought by his diuine maieſty in his faithfull ſeruant Francis; that this ſigne of the croſſe which he alwayes carryed imprinted in his hart, from the beginning of his conuerſion, might alſo exteriourly appeare in his body entierly vnited in the ſaid croſſe, and that as his ſoule was interiourly veſted with IESVS CHRIST, the habite of a penitent which he tooke repreſenting the image of the croſſe, the body alſo might in like ſort be inueſted with the ſaid ſacred ſigne, and that with ſuch colours and diſtinctions he might the more couragiously ſerue his God, as his principall Capitaine, in the ſpirituall warre and army, wherin God had ouercome the powers of ſpirituall ennemies. Yea and diuers miſteries of the croſſe, appeared in the S. from his firſt beginning in ſpirituall warfare, as in the diſcourſe of his life plainely appeareth, by the diuers apparitions of the croſſe which he had. And for farther aſſurance of the verity of ſo admirable a fact, God did not only giue teſtimonies worthy of creditt, that ſaw and with their owne handes touched, thoſe holy ſtigmates during his life: but did manifeſt them euen by merueillous apparitions, and miracles wrought after the death of the glorious Father, as hereafter we ſhall orderly diſcourſe, beſides what hath bin formerly ſaid, vpon the doubt of Pope Gregory the ninth, in the nine and fiftieth chapter of the ſecond booke.
                  A Religious Freer Minor, and Preacher very famous in regard of the admiration of many vertues that excelled in him, beleeued att firſt the myſtery of the ſacred ſtigmates which the holy Father had: neuertheles being deſirous to know by humane reaſon the occaſion of ſuch a miracle, he began to doubt therof; ſo that growing dayly more ſcrupulous his doubt encreaſed of ſo manifeſt a verity: Wherfore one night as he slept, S. Francis appeared vnto him, hauing his feet couered with dirt,How the doubt of the ſacred stigmates was cleared from a Frere Minor &amp; preacher. and a countenance humbly auſtere, and patiently angry who ſaid, what combatt doe thy cogitations cauſe thee? what turpitude hath ſo abſolutely poſſeſſed thee? behold my handes and feet. But the Religious, though he ſaw the woundes of his handes, with their nailes, could not yet perceaue thoſe of his feet, becauſe they were couered with dirt: wherfore the S. ſaid vnto him, put of the dirt from my feet, and behold the woundes of the nayles: and ſo the Religious deuoutly taking hold of his holy ſeet, ſeemed to make them cleane, and with his handes to touch the ſaid woundes; after which awaking, he found himſelfe all bathed with teares, and being cleared of all his ſcrupulous cogitations, he publiquely confeſſed his errour, with a firme beleefe of ſuch an aſſured verity, crauing pardon therof att the handes of God and his Sainct.
               
               
                  
                  Of other miracles, of the stigmates of the holy Father S. Francis.
                  THE II. CHAPTER.
                  
                     A Gentlewoman not beleuing a miracle of the stigmates which God had ſet on an image where there wer none an other miracle putting them out made her to beleeue. A Vertuous Gentlewoman of Rome, hauing choſen the holy Father S. Francis for her aduocate, and hauing vpon this occaſion placed his image in her oratory, beholding it one time, and ſeeing that it had not the ſacred ſtigmates, ſhe began in admiration to complaine, and not thincking it to be the fault of the painter that had neglected to make them, ſhe for many dayes had purpoſes to ſearch out the cauſe of this defect; but thoſe admirable ſignes one day appeared in an inſtant in that image, as they are accuſtomed to be paynted in all other. This Gentlewoman perceauing it, filled with feare and admiration, called her daughter who was very yong and deuout, and had dedicated herſelfe vnto God, and asked her if ſhe remembred that ſhe had formerly ſeene in that image thoſe ſtigmates that then appeared. The daughter did ſweare that ſhe had neuer ſeene them, and that they came there miraculously: But the ſoule of man often ſeeking occaſion to fall, calling the verity in doubt, there entred an other ſcruple into the hart of this gentlewoman, contrary to the former; which was that the ſaid ſtigmates had euer bin in the ſaid image, but that ſhe had not well obſerued it. God intending not to haue his firſt miracle miſpriſed, added a ſecond, permitting the ſaid ſtigmates to vaniſh againe and the image to remayne as before, and ſo the firſt miracle was confirmed by the ſecond.
                  Att the Citty of Lorio in Catalonia, there was a man named Iohn, very deuout vnto the holy Father S. Francis, who paſsing one night through a ſtreet where certaine lewd perſons attended to murder their ennemy that was to paſſe that way, who was a freind to the ſaid Iohn, and did reſemble him; ſo ſuppoſing him to be their ennemy in perſon, they aſſaulted him, and ſo wounded him, that they left him on the ground for dead, there remayning in him no hope of life; for the firſt blow cutt as it were cleane off one arme; beſides a ſtabbe that had pearced him thorough, vnder the breaſt, ſo that the winde which iſſued thence blew out ſix burning candelles ioyned together: wherevpon the Phiſicions preſently iudged him for dead, and as ſuch forſooke him; his woundes daily putrifying, the loathſome matter that iſſued out of his body was ſo intollerable, that euen his wife could no longer endure it: wherfore ſeeing that all humane helpe was out of hope, he had recourſe to his Patron, and to the bleſſed virgin, whome he had very confidently and couragiously inuocated att the inſtant of his wounding.

Now this miſerable afflicted thus lying in his bed, accompained only with his miſery, did in a manner continually weepe and often calling on the holy Father S. Francis, there one day appeared vnto him a man in habitt of a Freer Minor, who as it ſeemed to him, entred att the window, and calling him ſaid, know Iohn that becauſe thou haſt had confidence in me, God will cure thy woundes. Which the afflictedOne wounded to death cured by the ſacred ſtigmates of S. Franc. man hearing, he prayed him to lett him know who he was that brought him ſuch gratefull newes: he anſweared that he was Brother Francis; who comming neere him vnbound his woundes, and annoynted them with a precious oyntment: which doeing the ſick man felt ſuch vertue to proceed out of his ſacred handes, that he perceaued himſelfe manifeſtly to be healed, and ſo att an inſtant, from halfe dead, and already ſauouring, he was reſtored and cured; for his putrifaction was by the vertue of the ſignes of the paſsion of our Sauiour, chaunced into ſweet ſauour, and the fleſh of his woundes in ſuch ſort renewed that he was abſolutely cured: which done the Sainct diſappeared, and the good man aroſe from his bed with great ioy to prayſe God, and the bleſſed Sainct: then called his wife with ſo ſtronge a voice that ſhe was vtterly amazed, knowing that ſhe had left him in his bed with ſo litle courage that ſcarcely could he vtter a word: but finding him out of his bed and cured, whome ſhe thought to bury the next day, ſhe was much more amazed, wherfore ſhe ſo cryed out in admiration of the miracle, that ſhe was heard of all the neighbours. Thoſe of his family att firſt ſuppoſing him to be frantike, prayed him to retourne to his bed, for they could not be perſuaded that he was cured; but he hauing ſhewed them his body ſound, they were exceedingly abaſhed, being of opinion that he whome they ſaw was not Iohn, but a phantaſticall ſpiritt or viſion, which conceat neuer ceaſſed in them till he had recounted the whole progreſſe of the miracle, which being diuulged ouer the citty, the people abondantly flocked to ſee this man and the notable miracle, wrought by the ſacred ſtigmates of S. Francis, ad all repleniſhed with ioy and admiration, with one accord extolled the prayſes of the Standerd bearer of IESVS CHRIST, who being dead of body, neuertheles liued in the other life, ſo that by the admirable demonſtration of his preſence, and the ſweet touch of his handes, he raiſed, as may be ſaid, one already dead by meane of his more then humane marckes, with which our ſoueraigne Redeemer raiſed the Chriſtian people already dead eternally by ſinne.
               
               
                  
                  Of an other miracle of the stigmates of S. Francis.
                  THE III. CHAPTER.
                  IN the citty of Potencia in Apulia, there was a Preiſt called Roger, a very venerable man, and Canon of the great church, who being by meanes of an infirmity, become very feeble, entred one day into a church to pray, wherein was painted the image of S. Francis, with the ſtigmates, which beholding he began to conceaue a doubt in himſelfe of the ſublimity of the miracle, as of an inaccuſtomed thinge and vtterly impoſsible; his hart being thus wounded with incredulity, he felt att the verie inſtant ſuch a greiuous pearcing of his left hand, within his gloue, that an arrow flyeth not out of a bowe with more force and violence: wherupon being exceedingly amazed with the wound together with the ſtroake, and yet more with the ſecrett manner therof, he pulled of his gloue, to ſee with his eyes, the effect of that which he had heard and felt, and hauing neuer before had any wound in his hand, with admiration he beheld this new wound, whence began to proceed ſuch an extreme paine as he thought therof to dye: it was merueilous to conſider, for in the gloue appeared no ſigne att all but only in the hand, that the wound made ſecretly in the hand might be correſpondent to that which was ſecrett in the hart. So for the ſpace of two dayes making publicke relation of the occaſion, and the ſecrett of his incredulity, he confeſſed and with oath affirmed that he beleeued the ſacred ſtigmates to be imprinted in S. Francis; he humbly recommended himſelfe vnto him, beſeeching him, by the vertu of his ſacred ſtigmates, and by the efficacie of his interceſsion to procure the ceſſation of his paine. Att the end of two dayes his incredulity hauing bin ſufficiently puniſhed, God by the merittes of the S. gaue him eaſe, for the greife entierly ceaſſed, the heat of the hurt was qualified, and no ſigne of the wound remayned; ſo that ſecrett infirmity of the ſoule was cured by the manifeſt launce of the fleſh: and by diuine prouidence the body was cured together with the ſoule: the man remayning humble towardes God, deuout to his ſeruant S. Francis, and affectionate to the Religious of his Order. This ſo ſolemne miracle, was aſſured by autenticall letters from the Biſhop of the ſaid citty, ſealed with the ordinary ſeale, that thenceforward none might admitt any doubt of the ſacred woundes of the Sonne of God, diuinely imprinted in his ſeruant Francis, and that no mannes eye ſhould be euill to ſee that God is good, as if the liberality and gift of this grace, did not correſponde vnto the eternall bounty.
               
               
                  
                  Of the dead raiſed by the merittes of S. Francis.
                  THE IV. CHAPTER.
                  IN the citty of Mont-Maron neere to Beneuentum, there dyed a woman of ſinguler deuotion vnto the glorious Father S. Francis, where the Clergie being aſſembled the ſame euenning to ſing hir vigiles, the woman aroſe before them all, &amp; called one of the Preiſtes there preſent, ſaying vnto him: Father I deſire to be confeſſed of one ſinne: KnowA womā deuout vnto S. Francis raiſed to confeſse a ſinne and then died againe. that after my death, I ſhould haue bin cōdemned to the deuil in an obſcure &amp; horrible priſon, becauſe I neuer confeſſed a ſinne which I now deſire to confeſſe: but the holy Father S. Fr. hauing prayed for me, becauſe I haue euer deuoutly ſerued him, it is permitted me to retourne to life, that being confeſſed of this ſinne, I may afterward obtaine eternall life with him. And for aſſurance hereof as ſoone as I ſhalbe confeſſed, and haue abſolution, I ſhall goe to the glory promiſed. So hauing with exceeding great contrition confeſſed her ſinne, and performed the pēnance enioyned by her Confeſſour all trembling, accommodating her ſelfe ſweetly into her bed, ſhe slept in our Lord.
                  In the mountaines of Apulia, in the towne of Parmace, there was a maried man, that had one only daughter, young, and exceedingly beloued of himſelfe and her mother, who being ſeaſed with an inexpected and greiuous ſicknes ſodenlie dyed, wheratt the Father and mother being out of hope euer to haue other children, were ſo afflicted, that they were ready to dye with her. Theire kinred and freindes being come to bury and bewayle her; the mother was ſo ſorrowfull and oppreſſed with greife▪ that ſhe conſumed into teares, yea ſo gaue way to ſorrow, and ſo employed her ſelfe in this affliction, that ſhe neither ſaw nor vnderſtood any thing that was done in her houſe; but as euerie one was thus diſquieted, yea voide of hope; the holie Father S. Francis with one Religious only appeared to the motherThe only daughter of one deuout vnto S. Francis raiſed by his merittes. that was deuout vnto him, and in compaſsionate manner ſaid: Woman ceaſſe to lament, for the light of thy candell, whome thou bewayleſt as dead, ſhal by mine interceſsion be incontinentlie reuiued. Which ſaid he diſappeared; and the woman preſentlie related what had bin ſaid vnto her by the S. vnto thoſe preſent, and would not permitt the body of her dead daughter to be carryed to buriall: but comming neere her, and inuocating the name of S. Francis, ſhe lifted her vp aliue and in health in the preſence of her kinred and freindes, who gaue thanckes to God and to his bleſſed ſeruant.
                  
                     
The Frere Minors of Nocere ſtāding in need of a chariott demaunded one of a man named Peter, who in ſteed of lending them his chariottA blaſphemer of the name of S. Franc. lost his eldest ſonne, but repenting the S. restored him. and affording them the almoſe which they demaunded for the honour of God, and S. Francis, he ſotiſhly anſweared them, and with iniurious wordes curſed the name of the S. but he ſoone repented his folly, in regard of what incontinently befell him, which wrought in him a great feare of the wrath of God: for he loſt his eldeſt ſonne: who being euen then ſtricken with a diſeaſe ſodenly dyed, wherfore in an extreme paſſion that aſſailed his hart, caſting himſelfe on th
                        •
                      ground and there wallowing, he inuocated the S. with the ſame mouth that had ſo indiſcreetly blaſphemed him, and bitterly weeping ſaid: Father I am he that haue offended, I am he that haue impiously ſpoaken: thou doeſt iuſtlie chaſticie me ô S. of God! reſtore the innocent child to him that repenteth his fault, and is ready to doe pennance. Puniſhment is due to him that hath lewdly blaſphemed, wherfore I freely giue my ſelfe to thee, I offer me to ſerue thee for euer, and to offer vnto God ſacrifice of praiſe to the honour &amp; glory of thy holy name. It was admirable, that att theſe wordes his ſonne aroſe one his feet, and procuring end to their lamentation that mourned for him, he confidently affirmed that whē he dyed he ſaw the holy Father S. Francis, who had conducted his

                     oule from the ſeparation of the body, and by their prayers had reſtored it againe.
                  The ſonne of a Notary att Rome, about the age of ſeauen yeares, deſi

                     ing according to the cuſtome to goe with his mother to maſſe, ſhe vnwilling to permitt him, did ſhutt him into the houſe. The child ſeeing he could not gett out att the dore, lept out att the window, and fel dead againſt the ground. The mother that was not gone farre, hearing the fall, retourned againe, and ſeeing the ſorrowfull ſpectacle of her dead ſonne, croſsing her armes, began to crye out and torment her ſelfe, therby mouing all her neighbours to compaſsion. Now among them that there aſſembled, there was a Freer Minor that was goeing to preach in a church nere therevnto; but came firſt to ſee this acccident, where he ſaid to the Father of the dead child: doe you not beleue that S. Francis, by the great loue which he carryed to IESVS CHRIST crucified to giueS. Franc. by his merits raiſed a child. liue to mē, can raiſe thy ſonne? The Father anſweared that he firmily beleeeued it, faithfully confeſſed it, and would for euer remaine ſeruant to the S. if by his meane he might meritt to obtaine that fauour. The Religious then fell to his prayers, and exhorted all that were preſent to doe the like, which done the child firſt began to ſpeake, then opening his eyes, lifted vp his handes, not without exceeding aſtoniſhmēt of all the aſsiſtants that attentiuely beheld him. Finally he aroſe one his feet, and incontinently went to embrace his mother ſound and ſecure,

without any ſigne of ſuch a fall, which was performed by the vertue of the holy Father S. Francis.
               
               
                  Of other dead, raiſed by the merittes of the holy Father.
                  THE V. CHAPTER.
                  IN the citty of Capua, diuers children playing vpon the water-crane, one of them by miſchance fell into the riuer, which being very ſwift and violent, he ſunck inſtantly to the bottome where he remayned buryed in the ſand His companions not knowing how to helpeAnd an other drowned. him began to cry: which the people hearing, they haſtened thither from all pa

                     tes, many inuocating the merittes of S. Francis, in regard that the parētes of the child were very deuout vnto him, that he would pleaſe to aſsiſt him. Their prayer being ended, one of them that could ſwimme, inuocating the name of S. Francis, ſo laboured in the riuer that he found the place where the child was, couered with ſand whome with much ſorrow and paine he drew out quite dead, to the exceeding greife of thoſe preſent, who with loud voice cryed out: S. Francis the true ſeruant of God, reſtore this child aliue vnto his Father; yea certaine Iewes being there arriued, induced by a naturall commiſeration, likewiſe prayed vnto him: Att theſe prayers, the child that had bin dead and lay deformed on the ground, incontinently aroſe in health and ioyfull as he had come from play, and prayed thoſe preſent to conduct him to the church of ſainct Francis, that he might giue thanckes vnto him, acknowledgeing that by his merittes he had bin raiſed.

Retourning to her ſelfe ſhe begā with a ſorrowful voice to lamēt, in theſe wordes: O S. Frā
                     cis! O glorious S. reſtore me my child, I beſeech thee, by the loue wherwith thou haſt ſerued IESVS CHRIST. This womā did not pray alone, but together all that were preſēt, affectionatly imploring the S. to cōfort this diſolate mother, perceauing that this dead body had neither ſēce, nor voice, they tooke it &amp; ſtretched it out to be ſhrouded, to bury it the day following. But the mother repoſing great hope in God that by the metes of the S. her ſonne ſhould retou

midnight her child began to gape, and after his dead membres were warmed, in an inſtant he aroſe on his feet very ſound and well, to the great amazement of all that were preſent, who prayſed and thancked God for the ſame.

                     And an other. An other dead perſon was rayſed in Almaigne, wherof Pope Gregory the ninth, by his apoſtolicall letters att the translation of S. Francis, certified all that were preſent, and att the generall chapter of the Frere Minors, who vpon this aduertiſement ended their chapter with great alacrity. The manner and circumſtance of this miracle is not committed to writting, becauſe it is not knowen, neuertheles it is beleeued that the teſtimony of ſo holy a Pope much exceedeth in aucthority, all the declarations that may be made therof.
               
               
                  Of ſuch as were deliuered from danger of death, by the ſeruant of the omnipotent.
                  THE VI. CHAPTER.
                  THere was a gentleman neere vnto Rome, named Rodulphus, whoſe wife was very deuout, they willingly entertayned the Frere Minors into their houſe, as well in forme of hoſpitality (for they were very charitable) as for the loue and reuerence they carryed to the glorious Father S. Francis. Now it once happened that two Frere Minors being lodged with them, whiles they were a sleep, a ſentinell

that kept watch by night on a very high tower, reſting againſt a peice of wood that was not well faſtened, the wood and the man fell both from the hight of the ſaid tower, vpon the roofe of the lodging, and thence to the ground, with ſuch a noyſe that cauſed very many, yeaA man fallen from the hight of a towre, had no hurt, by the merites of S. Franc. the maſter and miſtreſſe, with the ſaid Frere Minors to haſten thither who found the man ſo fallen, in ſuch a deepe sleep, that he perceaued, not himſelfe to be fallen nor did awake, att the noyſe made by them that came to helpe him: ſo that he was pulled, and called, and att length ſo rudely ſhaken, that he awaked out of that profound sleep: cō
                     playning that he had bin diſtourbed of the ſweet repoſe wherin he was: affirming that he slept with extreme contentment in the armes of the glorious Father S. Francis. But when he was ſhewen his fall, and had ſeene whence he came euen to the ground, he was vtterly amazed and beſide himſelfe, to conſider what had happened vnto him without any knowledge of his till the preſente. Wherfore be promiſed vnto God before them all, in acknowledgement of ſo worthy a benefitt, to doe pennance, for the fauour afforded vnto him by the merittes of the glorious Father S. Francis.
                  In the towne of Pophy, in Campania, a Preiſt called Thomas, goeing to repaire a mill appertayning to the church ſcituat on the border ofAn other fallen vnder a water mill. the riuer, he fell by miſchance vnder the wheele of the mill, which by violence of his motion carryed him downe, and held him in the current, with his face vpward, without power to moue or ſpeake by reaſon that the water which draue the wheele fell on his face, ſo that he could not vtter one word. Wherfore he called in his hart for help vnto S. Francis, hauing no farther power, and hauing ſo remayned a good ſpace, his companions endeauouring to aſsiſt him, by force and induſtry they ſo preuayled that the wheele tourned backe, ſo that the Preiſt was by the current of the water incontinently carryed into the depth of the chanell: and whiles he was there, there appeared vnto him a Frere Minor cloathed in white and girded with a corde, who very dextrously took him by the arme, and drew him out of the chanell, ſaying vnto him: I am that Francis whome thou haſt inuocated. The preiſt therfore finding himſelfe not only freed from danger, but perfectly well, conſidering the greatnes of the miracle, and the great mercy of God in his behalfe, by the merittes of S. Francis, exceedingly amazed, and proſtrating himſelfe to the earth to kiſſe the feet of his benefactour, but not ſeing him, he being already vaniſhed, he asked his companions whither he was gone, and how he might finde him: but they knowing no more then himſelfe, began to conceaue the miracle. Wherfore they all together fixing their eyes on the earth, did eleuate their ſpiritt to God, magnifying his immenſiue greatnes, and the vertuous

merittes of the Sainct.
                  Certaine yong men goeing from the towne Celan to gather graſſe in a feild, where there was a well, which being ouergrowne with graſſe was not ſeene, and each of them endeauouring to cutt his part, it chaunced that one of them fell into the well, where the water was fower paſes deep. Falling he called for the helpe of S. Francis with a very ſtrong faith and deuotion, and ſo lowd that all his companionsAn other fallen into a well. heard him: and not ſeeing him, they came to the place where they hea

                     d the voice, and by the way which his hooke had made thy found the well, where ſeeing him therin, they ran to their houſes, lamenting and crying for helpe, where they ſo moued their towne fellowes, that they came to aſsiſt him, and one of them deſcending into the well, found him ſitting on the water, without receauing any detriment, and drawing him out, he told them that falling, he had inuocated the help of S. Francis, who in his very fall aſsiſted him with his preſence; for he very gently ſupported him with his ſacred hand, neuer leauing him till they had drawne him out, then he exhorted them all together with him to giue thanckes to God, for that by the vertue of his faithfull ſeruant, he had deliuered him from death, and ſo they retourned to the towne giuing thanckes to God and to S. Francis.
                  When the Romane Court was reſident att Aſsiſium, the Cardinall of Hoſtia, (who was afterward Pope Alexander the fourth) 'preaching in the church of S. Francis, there fell a groſſe ſtone vpon the head of a deuout womā, wherwith ſhe receaued ſuch hurt that falling to the ground,A womā being wounded with a groſſe ſtone. each one thought her to be dead, and for ſuch couered her with her owne coate not to trouble the ſermon, with reſolution to carry her out to performe her funeralles. But this woman as she teſtified afterward, when ſhe receaued the blow, with great faith called for the helpe of ſainct Francis; ſhe was then before his altare, ſo the ſermon being ended, ſhe aroſe with the other women ſound and perfectly well, without any ſigne of hurt: and which is admirable,A double admirable cure. hauing formerly had a great paine in her head that had long troubled her, in fauour of this laſt mortall blow, ſhe neuer felt any paine after.
                  Neere to the citty of Cornette, where there is a monaſterie of Frere Minors, as they were melting a bell, many of the neighbour places repaired thither to ſee it: but there aroſe ſuch a winde, that the whole world ſeemed ready to be diſſolued, and taking the two doores it mounted them into the aire, and caſt them againe on the ground with great impetuoſity and violence, wherof one fell on a child called Bartholomew about eight yeares of age, which a woman, deuout vnto the Couent, had ſent thither with an almoſe.

Now they all eſteemed him not only dead, but vtterly diſmembred vnder ſuch a waight; neuertheles inuocating the glorious Father ſainct Francis, they ran all to lift vp the child from vnder the dore; the Father of him being preſent, was ſo ſurpriſed with greife, that he was euen ſenceleſſe, yet he inuocated the Sainct to whome he offered his ſonne if he recouered: the dore attA child on whom had fallen the dore of a church. length being lifted vp, the child aroſe on his legges ſound and well as if he had awakened from a sleep, which procured a great ioy to the people and particulerly to his Father. Now according to his vow, the child being of competent age, which was about fourteen yeares, he made him a Frere Minor, where he dyed piously, hauing ſo liued a good Religious, of a notable ſpiritt, worthy doctrine, and a famous Preacher.
               
               
                  Certaine other miracles like to theſe, of diuers that were deliuered from the danger of death.
                  THE VII. CHAPTER.
                  CErtaine men of Caſtel-Lantin, hauing cutt out a verie great ſtone, to place vnder the altare of a church of ſainctA man crushed with a verymaſſie stone by the merites of S. Frno hurt befel hun therby. Francis, that was ſhortlie after to be dedicated, albeit they were forty men to raiſe and accommodate the ſame on the wagon to carrie it to the ſaid Church, yet were they not of ſufficiencie to performe the ſame. Now ſome of them attempting to trye their forces and to doe more then they were able; the ſtone slipped out of their hold and fell vpon one of them: which was a great terrour and greife to the reſt, as not knowing how to releiue their companion. Wherfore they went away all, to ten perſons, as not able to endure that hideous ſpectacle: which ten inſpired of God, hauing inuocated ſainct Francis, praying him to haue compaſsion of him that had ſo employed himſelfe in his ſeruice, they attempted to tourne the ſaid ſtone, which they ſo eaſely handled that they perceaued well they were aſsiſted by the S. The ſtone being remoued the man aroſe very ſound, without any hurt, yea hauing one eye defectiue, he was entierly cured therof, that it might publiquely appeare what power the holy Father S. Francis had with God, euen in deſperate matters.
                  An other accident like vnto this, happened att ſainct Seuerin in the Marquiſat of Ancona, in this ſort; A very great ſtone being

brought from Conſtantinople, and by the helpe of diuers men carryed into the Church of the ſaid S. in laying it downe it ſo slipt that a man fell directly vnder it; but the ſtone att the very inſtant rayſed it ſelfe: S. Francis appeared to the miſerable labourer, whome he cauſed ſound &amp; ſafe to ariſe, albeit he was eſteemed vtterly cruſhed in peeces.
                  
                     Nor an other. A Burgeſſe, of Gayette, called Bartholomew, earneſtly employed in building the Church of S. Francis, there to be erected, a beame of timber being not well ſetled, fell vpon his neck, ſo that he was eſteemed a dead man: as well therfore, as he could, he required the B. Sacrament of a Religious there preſent, who ſuppoſing it impoſsible for him to liue till the ſame might be procured; vſed vnto him theſe wordes of S. Auguſtin: Crede &amp; manducast
                           •
                        , beleeue and make account that thou haſt eaten and receaued it; then he cauſed him to be carryed to his houſe. The night following, S. Francis with eleuen Religious appeared vnto him, holding before him a litle lābe, and drawing neere the bed, he called him ſaying: Bartholomew, feare not: for the deuill ſhall not be able to hinder thee from labouring in my ſeruice. Behold the lambe which thou diddeſt require to be giuen thee, whome thou haſt receaued by thy good and pious deſire, and by vertue wherof thou ſhalt recouer health of bodie and ſoule. Then hauing layd on him his ſacred hand, and giuen him his holy benediction, he commanded him to goe finiſh the worck begun. He being vtterlie amazed ariſing in the morning entirely cured of ſo mortall a blow, retourned with alacrity to his labour: which paſſed with incredible admiration to all thoſe that had left him for dead, who awakened their ſoules, diſpoſing them to loue and deuoutlie to reuerence the holy Father S. Francis.
                  In the towne of Ceperan, there was a man called Nicholas, who was ſo wounded by his ennemies, that they left him for dead vpon the pauement.Nor an other by death. But whiles they ſtroke him he alwayes with a loud voice cryed out: S. Francis helpe me: which crye was heard a farre of by diuers who from the place where they were, could not ſo redely releiue him, but came to ſee him when the fact was done, and carryed him into his houſe, where he aſſured them, that albeit they ſaw him all bathed in his bloud, notwithſtanding he ſhould not dye of thoſe woundes, wherof he neither felt any kinde of paine, and that this proceeded of the helpe he had receaued of the holy Father S. Francis: and alſo that he had obtayned of God, time for to doe penance. The ſucceſſe confirmed the ſame: for being waſhed from his bloud, he was withall cured of his woundes to the great aſtoniſhment of thoſe that had ſeene and carryed him into his houſe.
                  In the towne of S. Geminian, a gentlemans ſonne had a flux of bloud iſſuyng out of his eyes and mouth, which had brought him to

Franc. hearing, his members alſo were ſo weakened that he ſeemed inſenſible, and att euery moment was expected the yelding vp of his ſpiritt. Many therfore of his fathers freindes repairing as the manner is, to comfort him, they had no other diſcourſe but of his buriall. But the father that had a great faith and confidence in God, though as a man he was exceedinglie afflicted, entertayned in his conceit a pious cogitation, which he put in execution, for leauing all thoſe that were come to comfort him, he retired himſelfe alone into the Church of S. Francis that was neere vnto his houſe, where falling proſtrate on the groōd, he putt his girldle about his necke, and prayed to S. Francis that he would pleaſe to be a meditatour for the health of his ſonne, in ſuch ſort and with ſo great a faith, ſo profound a humility, and ſuch dolorous plaintes and teares, that he merited to be heard of IESVS CHRIST, then filled with hope, he retourned to his houſe where he found his kinred and freindes full of ioy, for the health which his ſonne had recouered, ſo that they and he together chaunged their teares into ioy and their affliction into contentmēt. So by the interceſsion of the ſaid S. the death of the ſonne was tourned into life. And afterward they altogether gaue thanckes to God, and his freindes and kinred departed exceedinglie comforted and edified by the vertue of the holy father S. Francis.
                  
                     And an other ſick in like ſort. Then an other. A Prieſt alſo that was poiſoned. Our Lord IESVS CHRIST wrought a like action, by the merites of this glorious S. in a towne called Tamarit in Catalonia; where he reſtored health to a yong gentlewoman; as alſo to an other of Ancona, who had a daughter ready to dye, through the extremity of her diſeaſe, whoſe father inuocating the S. obtayned his daughters health.
                  A Preiſt named Mattheiw of a citty called Ville-blāche, hauing drunk a deadly poyſon incontinentlie loſt his ſpeech, his tongue and bodie ſwelled in ſuch ſort that death only was expected. An other Preiſt being preſent att this pittifull ſpectacle, perſuaded him to be incontinentlie confeſſed: the other fell on his knees, but could not vtter ſo much as one word; wherfore making vſe of reaſon, he humblie recommended himſelfe vnto God in heart, beſeeching him to vouchſafe by the merittes of his ſeruant Francis, to free him from ſuch an odious death. At the verie inſtant, which was admirable, he began with a loud voice to inuocate the name of S. Francis, then he vomited the venime which he had receaued, yelding thanckes to God and S. Francis.
               
               
                  
                  How S. Francis deliuered many pilgrimes from tempeſts and misfortunes of the ſea.
                  THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                  CErtaine nauigatours were on a time in this ſort in peril of death: they being ſome fiue leagues diſtant from the harbour of Barut, the windes and tempeſtes growing violent, fearing to be drowned they caſt ankor, but their diſaſter by the impetuoſitie of the windes ſo encreaſed, and the ſeas in ſuch ſort ſwelled that the cables breaking, the ankors did ſtick faſt to the bottome, and the veſſell floated heere and there, without hope of ſafety, by reaſon of the incertaintie of the courſe of the waters and the inequalitie of the tide, till it pleaſed God to calme the ſea, when the mariners as halfe dead began to ſeeke their ankors in the ſea where they perceaued the cables, there employing all the dilligence and art they could deuiſe. But their labour vainlie ſpent, they inuocated the aſsiſtance of diuers ſainctes. And being exceedinglie wearied, one of them whoſe name was Perfectus, though of condicion verie lewd and imperfect, ſaid in ſcoffing manner to his companions: You haue implored the aſsiſtance of ſo manie Sainctes, yet haue they not heard you: lett vs a litle inuocate that new ſainct called Francis, and lett vs ſee if he will diue into theS. Franc. by his interceſſiō made iron ankers to ſwime vpon the ſea. ſea to finde our ankors, wherto all the reſt accorded, not in deriſion as he moued it, but heartelie and with great faith, reprehending Perfectus for his ſottiſh ſpeech and deriſion: and ſo praying and making vowes, they inſtantlie ſaw their ankors miraculously to ſwimme vpon the waters, as if the nature of iron had bin chaunged into that of wood; ſo that by this meane they perſiſted deuoute and fully comforted.
                  A poore pilgrime exceedinglie wearied and afflicted, by meanes of a ſharpe feuer that had a long time tormented him, came by ſhippe from beyond the ſea; he had enterpriſed this iorney to ſee the body of the glorious Father Sainct Francis, to whome he was exceedinglie deuoted: and not being entierlie recouered of the

                     aid ſicknes, he was one day extremelie afflicted with thirſt: but hauing no freſh water in the ſhippe where he was, he began to call with a loud voice and with a ſtrong faith for drinck to be brought him, affirming that he well knew that Sainct Francis had filled his barrell with pure water: and ſo in deed the barrell (which was knowne to be empty) was found full of ſweet and cleare water. The day following

there a roſe a very cruell tempeſt, which ſo raiſed the wauesS. Frans. miraculouſly sēt fresh water to one deuoted vnto him and in his fauour ceaſsed a violent tempeſte. that they couered all the ſaid ſhippe, which was ſo beaten with the windes that the mariners expected the breaking of the maſtes &amp; tacklinge, and conſequentlie the immediate ſincking and drowning of the veſſel and themſelues by the furious impetuoſitie of the ſurges. But when the ſaid pilgrime, that ceaſſed not to pray for them all, began to cry a loft: Brethren ariſe and come to entertaine Sainct Francis who commeth to aſsiſt vs: behold him, he is come to ſaue vs. Then did they all kneele downe, and with teares and ſighes beſeech him to voutſafe to make interceſsion for their deliuery. The ſea immediatlie became calme, the windes and cruell tempeſte ceaſſed, and they all gaue thanckes to the almighty, and reſted obliged to the pilgrime, who att the inſtant was alſo cured of his feiuer, and together they perſeuered deuout to the holy Father S. Francis.
                  Brother Iames of Ariete paſsing ouer a riuer in a boat with other of his Brethren, and comming to the ſhoare attempting to land out of the boate as his componions had done, the boat was vtterlie ouerturned, ſo that both himſelfe and the ferry-man tombled in the water,S. Franc. preſerued a Fr. Minor from drownīg yea from being wett, though he were in the bottom of a riuer. the ferry-man ſaued himſelfe by his dexterity of ſwiming: but the Religious ſunck to the bottome. The other Religious extremelie afflicted att the miſchance of their Brother, moſt inſtanlie prayed S. Francis that he would voutſafe to aſsiſt his deuout child, who on his owne part in the beſt ſort he could in the water imployed the helpe of his holy Father: who failed not in ſo vrgent a neceſsity to relieue this his beloued child: for he continually accompanied him in the depth of the water, till they aſcended to the boat, where being taken by the hand he mounted, and went afterward to his Brethren, who were much amazed, not only to ſee him ſafe and ſecure, but more to ſee his garmentes ſo dry, notwithſtanding the long time he had bin in the bottome of the riuer, in ſo much that one drop of water could not be perceaued vpon him.
                  An other Religious called Bonauenture trauailling with two of his companions in a boat, which by the forcible current of the water being ſplitted on the one ſide, they by that meanes ſunck to the bottomeAnd alſo three Religious of the riuer, but they from the lake of miſeries inuocating the depth of mercie, and in this imminent perill imploring the aſsiſtance of their holy Father S. Francis, the barke att length was raiſed without one dropp of water, and being conducted by the power of God and the vertue of the glorious S. they all arriued ſafe and ſecure to the ſhoare. And an other.
                  
                  A Religious of Aſcoli being caſt into a riuer, was deliuered of the danger by the merittes of the ſainct.
                  
                     
                     And certaine men and women. And alſo Mariners of Ancona Certaine men and women being in manifeſt perill of drowning in the riuer of Riete, they inuocated the helpe of S. Francis, and were deliuered from the dangerous ſhipwrack of their veſſell.
                  Certaine Mariners of Ancona, being in a vehement ſtorme without hope of ſauing themſelues, and as it were aſſured of their death, they humbly inuocated the aſsiſtance of S. Francis, yea with ſuch faith, that there incontinently appeared a great light about their ſhippe, wherby in an inſtant they found the ſea very calme, as if the glorious S. by his admirable vertues, could att his pleaſure commaund the ſeas and the windes. I ſhould in deed eſteeme it a matter impoſsible to vndertake in this behalfe perticulerly to relate the admirable miracles which this holy Father hath cauſed to appeare ſo potent by ſea as by land, where he hath aſsiſted &amp; releiued an infinite number of miſerable diſpayring perſons. And in truth it is not to be admired, that now raigning in heauen he commaund the ſea, conſidering that whiles he liued in the world, he was obeyed of euery liuing creature, yea in admirable manner.
               
               
                  How diuers haue bin deliuered out of priſon by the merittes and interceſsions of the ſainct.
                  THE IX. CHAPTER.
                  A Grecian ſeruant of a gentleman in the Romane confines was falsly accuſed of theft: wherevpon his maſter cauſed him to be apprehended and caſt into an obſcure priſon, with order to be bound and chained: but his miſtreſſe knowing it, was exceeding ſorrowfull, becauſe ſhe eſteemed him ſincere and faithfull, therfore often prayd her husband not to condemne him of disloyaulty but to ſett him att liberty; but her prayers could take no hold in the obſtinacie of her husband, and therfore ſhe had recourſe to the helpe of the glorious Father ſainct Francis, beſeeching him to vndertake the patronage of theS. Franc. deliuereth a priſoner iniuſtly impriſoned. truth, to her prayers adding vowes. This aduocat of the afflicted went att the ſame time to viſitt the priſoner; and hauing broaken the walles of the priſon, and cauſed the manacles to fall from his handes, and the fetters from his feet, taking him by the hand led him out, ſaying: I am he to whome thy miſtreſſe hath ſo affectionately recommēded thee. And albeit this poore priſoner was in extreme feare, and wandered much to find his way being much amazed and labouring to cleare his paſſadge, by the vertue yet of his deliuer he found himſelfe in the direct way, where he euidently knew the fauour he had receaued, whervpon taking courage he went incontinently to his miſtreſſe, to whome

he recounted the miracle, which encreaſed her feruour and loue towardes our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and her deuotion towardes S. Francis.
                  
                     A gentleman miſpriſing S. Franc. had trial of his power. In the citty of Maſſa, a poore man was to pay a quantity of ſiluer to a knight; but he was ſo poore that his goodes being inſufficient to diſchardge the debt, he was att the ſute of the knight impriſoned, the wretch therfore finding himſelfe faſt in priſon, prayed the ſaid knight to haue compaſsion of him, and graunt him ſome time for the loue of S. Francis: but this proud and merciles man contemning the cryes of this poore man, together with the loue of S. Francis, as if the loue of the ſainctes were a friuolous matter and of ſmall conſequence, anſweared him arrogantlie, that he would putt him in ſuch a place as neither S. Francis nor any other ſhould deliuer him, till he had diſchardged his debt: and ſo cauſed him to be ſhutt vp in an obſcure priſon, with fetters and manacles, thereby ſuppoſing, conformably to his peruerſe will and not vnto reaſon, to torment him the more: but a litle after that he had practiſed this impietie, the glorious ſainct Francis went to the priſon, brake the dores, lockes, and iron chaines, manacles and fetters, and ſo freed the poore fellow, and ſent him directly to his houſe hauing by this admirable miracle trodden vnder foote the pride of the world. The cruelty of this knight was thenceforward chaunged into great mildnes.
                  Albertus of Areſſo being alſo detained in priſon, but iniuſtly: becauſe the debtes pretended againſt him was not due, he recommended his innocencie to the holie Father S. Francis, to whome as alſo to his Religious, he was exceedingly deuoted, which he who had cauſed him to be impriſoned vnderſtanding, with a loud voice blaſphemously anſweared: neither S. Francis, nor God himſelfe ſhall deliuer thee out of my hā

                  Of other miracles like vnto the forſaid.
                  THE X. CHAPTER.
                  IN the time of Pope Gregory the ninth, there was a Cittizen of Aliſia called Peter, who being accuſed of hereſie, was apprehended att Rome, and by order from the Pope committed to the cuſtodyS. Franc. freed a priſoner without ſeking him att liberty. of the Biſhop of Tiuoly, aſſuring him that if he permitted him to eſcape he ſhould be depriued of his biſhopprick. He then hauing receaued chardge of him, had him no ſooner in protection, but he chained him with fetters and manacles: and caſt him into a ſtrong and ſtrict priſon, and gaue him bread by waight, and water by meaſure. The miſerable wretch therfore finding himſelfe reduced to that ruefull and pittifull eſtate, hartelie recommended himfelfe vnto God and continually powred out teares; he implored the aſsiſtance of S. Francis, praying him to haue compaſsion on him, calling withall to memorie that his feaſt approached: and becauſe the light of faith had expelled all peruerſity and errour of hereſie, affectionatlie recommending himſelfe to the faithfull ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST, he merited to be heard of his diuine maieſtie. For in the verie night of the holy Interceſſours feaſt, about the beake of day, the mercifull Father diſcended in to the priſon and called him by his name, willing him incontinentlie to ariſe. He not hauing heard the dores of the priſon to open, nor any other noiſe, and hearing himſelfe called, full of trembling demaunded who called him. Hauing vnderſtood that it was S. Francis, and perceauing his manacles and fetters to be fallen of from his handes and feet: and ſeeing the dores of themſelues to open, he was ſtricken into ſuch an amazement, that albeit he found his perſon freely att liberty and had commodity to goe forth, yet had he not power to ſtirre from his place. Being in this perplexity, he called out, and the keepers came running, who ſeeing the man thus vnchained, knowing well in what manner he was fettered; perceauing alſo the dores of themſelues to be opened, that were ſo ſurely faſtened, and the lockes with other iron implementes lying on the ground, they aduertiſed the biſhop therof, who goeing incontinentlie to the priſon, and hāuing ſeene and conſidered all circumſtances, knew manifeſtly that it was a worck of God. Wherat falling on hIs knees he adored God, and cauſing the chaines, manacles and other irons, as lockes, barres and nailes that were miraculouslie looſed, to be gathered together, he ſent all to the Pope and Cardinals, to whome he related the miraculous hiſtorie not

without admiration to his Holines, who was willing to giue abſolute freedome to this wretch, for his Interceſſotrs ſake.
                  A gentleman called Guidolot, of S. Giminian, was falſely accuſed to haue poiſoned a knight, and to haue reſolued alſo to poiſon his ſonne withall his family, in which reſpect he was by the gouernour of theS. Franc. was protectour of the innocencie of a gētleman deuout vnto him. place committed priſoner to a very ſtrong tour, where his handes and feet were loaden with irons, but knowing his owne innocencie he put his hope in God, recommended his cauſe to the holy Father S. Francis, and inuocated him to be his Aduocat and Protectour. But the gouernour conſidering the enormity of the fact wherof he was accuſed, deuiſed by what tortures he could to wreſt out the truth of this accuſation &amp; by what tormēt to putt him to death when he ſhould haue acknowledged the crime: and hauing determined to begin the next morning by torture to examine him: the gentleman the ſame night was viſited by Sainct Francis, who was enuironed with a reſplendant light which ſtill continued till the break of day, and this diuine light being gone, the priſoner was exceeding ioyfull, with hope ſhortly to be deliuered without any detriment. Now ſoone after the Sergeants came to conduct him to the place of examination, where without other proceeding he was faſtened to the torturing cord, then being lifted vp very high, the Iudge examined him vpon the crime: but hauing confeſſed nothing, the Iudge appointed a great weight of iron to be faſtened vnto him, wherwith he was often times hoiſſed aloft, and violentlie lett downe againe, to make him confeſſe. But he as innocent and interiourlie comforted by the diuine maieſtie, in fauour of his innocencie, appeared before the face of the iudge full of ioy, as one that felt not any paine by the tormentes. The Iudge perceauing that he contemned his tortures, became furious and commanded a great fire to be kindled vnder him, that by the extremitie of the hote fire, he might be conſtrayned to confeſſe the fact, which proued vaine, for neither the fire, nor ſmoake, did in any ſort offend him. The iudge therfore, for his laſt crueltie cauſed a veſſell full of boiling oyle to be caſt in his face, which by the vertue and meritof his Aduocat to whome he had recommended his cauſe, procured him no more offence then had done the former extremities. Att length the Iudge and executioners, wearied with tormenting this gentleman, he was by ſentence declared innocent and freed, and remitted to his former freedome and liberty,
               
               
                  
                  Of the certaine women, that being with child and in danger of death; att their deliuery were releiued by the ſainct.
                  THE XI. CHAPTER.
                  A Great Counteſſe ot Slauonia, who was no leſſe famous for her vertue and worthines, then noble in bloud and diſcent, was exceeding deuout vnto S. Francis, and very charitable, vnto his Religious. She being in trauaile of child, was ſo tormented with throwes, that the birth of the child was attended to be her death; all humane helpe was deſpaired of, without deſtroying the fruit. Now amiddeſt the anguiſhes, ſhe called to minde the great vertues and merittes of S. Francis and of his eminencie, therefore hauing att other times bin piously affected vnto him, ſhe with a very ſtrong confidence, had recourſeA lady very happely deliuered in a dā
                        gerous trauaile of child. vnto him, as to the aſſured refuge of the deſolate, ſaying: O glorious S. all my afflicted members, beſeech thy pitty to aſsiſt them, and I promiſe thee by hart, that which I cannot expreſſe by wordes. Behold an admirable accident! ſhe had no ſoeuer vttered theſe wordes, but her pangues did ceaſſe as did the terme of her trauaile, for ſhe brought into the world a faire and healthfull boy, neither did ſhe faile of her vowe; for ſhe cauſed to be builded a faire and lardge church, in honour of her deliuerer, which being finiſhed, ſhe gaue it to his Religious, ſpending the reſt of her dayes exemplarly, more affected then euer to the glorious father ſainct Francis, her Aduocate and Protectour.
                  About the plaines of Rome, a woman called Beatrix, whoſe time of greatnes being complete, and hauing alreadie four whole dayes caryed her fruit dead in her wombe, oppreſſed with moſt violent tormentes, she expected only death, the creature which ſhe carryed liueleſſe in her, reducing her to this extremity: the Phiſicians failed not to adminiſter vnto her all conuenient remedies that they could deuiſe; but all humane helpe was vaine, ſo that the malediction whichA womā was deliuered of a dead child by touching a girdle of S. Fr. God gaue to Eue in the earthlie Paradice, might be ſaid to be in a ſupreme manner fallen vpon her, conſidering that her verie wombe wherin ſhe had alreadie buryed her ſonne, was the beginning of her ſepulture. Now for her laſt releife, ſhe ſent to the Church of ſainct Francis to demaund ſome relique, where finding no other thing then a peice of the cord wherwith he was girded, two Religious of his Order brought it vnto her and layd it reuerently vpon her. It admirably ſucceeded, that as ſoone as this dolefull woman had touched the

piece of cord, ſhe was deliuered of her dead child, which doubtlesly had cauſed her death, ſo that her anguiſhes did ceaſe, and ſhe remayned ſound and deliuered from the imminent perill of death.
               
               
                  Of other like miracles, in aſsiſting litle children.
                  THE XII. CHAPTER.
                  ALl the children that a gentlewoman of Carnio called Iulian, brought into the world, did dye before ſhe could haue comfort of them, which cauſed her an extreame affliction, inceſſantlyA womā that could not bring vp her children, did nourish one by the interceſsiō of S. Fr. that proued very vertuous. complayning of her diſaſtre that till then ſhe had brought foorth her children only to be buryed; now it chaunced that being four monthes gone with child, reflecting more, by reaſon of her diſgraces paſt, vpon the death, then the birth of the child conceaued in her wombe, ſhe prayed ſainct Francis for the conſeruation of the life of that which was not yet borne. Vpon a night therfore, there appeared vnto her in viſion a woman hauing in her armes a right beautifull child, which ſhe offered her, but ſhe refuſed it, as fearing it would incontinently periſh in her handes. Notwithſtanding the ſaid woman encouraged her ſaying: receaue it confidently, for it is ſent thee by the glorious Father ſainct Francis, the true comforter of the afflicted, and be aſſured it ſhall not dye as the reſt haue done, but ſhall liue, and thou ſhalt find great contentment in his vertuous diſpoſition. Awaking, ſhe remembred this celeſtiall viſion, which thenceforward procured her exceeding ioy to the time of her deliuery, which was of a ſtronge and complete ſonne; who as he came into the world by the interceſsion of S. Francis ſo did alſo the vertues and merittes of the S. encreaſe in him, that being great he induced his parentes to liue ſpiritualy: he faithfully ſerued IESVSAnd an other alſo. A womā that could haue no ſonnes had by the merites of S. Franc. two att a birth. CHRIST, and honoured his glorious SS. with great zeale, and perticulerly the holy Father S. Francis.
                  The like miracle was wrought in the citty of Tiuoly. A woman hauing diuers daughters, much deſired to haue a ſonne; to which effect ſhe often offered her prayers with a ſtrong faith vnto ſainct Francis that he would be her Interceſſor, who att lenght conceauing and the time of deliuery attended, her fauour was doubled, for att one birth ſhe brought into the world two ſonnes, wherof being ouer-ioyed, ſhe yelded infinite thanckes to God the Creatour and to his deuout ſeruant S. Francis.
                  Neere the citty of Viterbo, a woman being neere her deliuery, was ſubiecte to ſoundinges, ſuch as ſhe was often ſuppoſed to be dead

being withall oppreſſed with ſuch panges and throwes as women in that caſe doe ordinarilie endure; her nature and ſtrenght alreadie failing her, and as it were deſperate of all humane helpe, ſhe deuoutlie inuocated ſainct Francis, and with ſuch faith recommended her ſelfe to his merittes, that ſhe was miraculouslie freed of thoſe tormentes, and was deliuered of a fayre and well proportioned child: But w

                     eras ſhortlie after, ſhee ſeemed to haue forgotten this great benefitt receaued, not yelding due honour vnto the ſainct, becauſe one the day of his feaſt, in ſteed of honouring and ſanctifying it, ſhe employed her ſelfe in certaine baſe and vnſeemelie exerciſes, God permitted, for this ingratitude, her right arme inſtantliePunishment of a womā ingratefull to S. Francis. to wither: the iuſt diuine wroth reſted not there, but ſhe attempting to lift vp her cripled arme with the other, that alſo withered withall. This woman thus miſerablie afflicted, became repentant and acknowledged her crime committed, and with ſuch a faith promiſed almightie God to amend her ſelfe, that by her true contrition and penitence, ſhe merited to haue the vſe of her armes thus loſt, by almightie God, reſtored vnto her, through the merittes of ſainct Francis; wherin appeareth how God puniſheth ingratitude, and admitteth into fauour the truelie penitent.
                  
                     A womā was aſsiſted by S. Francis and deliuered of a most dangerous child birth. An other woman of the countrie of Arrezzo in Tuſcane, hauing for ſeauen dayes together endured intollerable anguiſhes of childbirth, being become euen all blacke and deformed in her countenance, by meanes of the extremitie of her greife her cure being deſperate, ſhe, more by heart then voice, vowed her ſelfe to ſainct Francis, and with ſuch a firme confidence implored his aide, that falling into a slumber, ſhe ſaw in viſion her Interceſſour, who ſweetlie ſaluted her, demaunding of her if ſhe knew him: and ſhe anſweared, ſhe did: Then he bid her ſay the Salue Regina, affirming that before ſhe had ended the ſame, ſhe ſhould be ſecurelie deliuered. This woman vpon this diſcourſe awaking, with great hope began the Salue; and hauing ſaid, Illos tuos m

                  THE XVII. CHAPTER.
                  THere was a Religious in the Couent of the Freer Minros at Naples, called Robert, that for diuers yeares had bin blind, yea there were fleſhy lumpes growne with in his eyes that hindered the motion and vſe of the eyeliddes; Diuers Religious being from ſeuerall partes of the world aſſembled vnto this Couent, the holy Father S. Frā
                     cis vouchſafed in their preſence to cure him that was blinde, therby to encourage the ſaid Religious that were to attempt a long iourney; ſo that the ſaid Religious ſuppoſing one night to dye, and hauing had the recommendation of his ſoule, the holy Father ſainct Antony of Padua, Brother Auguſtin, and Brother Iames of Aſsiſium, and takingS. Franc. cured a Religious of a mortall infirmity of his eyes. a knife, he cutt of all the ſuperfluous fleſh that was on his eyes: in ſuch ſort that in one inſtant he both reſtored his cleare ſight; and deliuered him from preſent death: and then ſaid vnto him: Robert this fauour which I haue done thee, is a pledge and teſtimony vnto all the Religious that are to depart hence to trauell into diuers contryes, that I wilbe continuallie in their preſence, and will direct their ſteppes, that they may fulfill their obediences with a greater conſolation, ioyfull hart, and as enamoured of our Lord IESVS CHRIST.
                  Neere vnto Thebes in the Romane contrie, a blind woman, hauing faſted with bread and water on the vigill of ſainct Francis, theA blinde woman receaued ſight on the feast of S. Fr. morning of the feaſt, her husband verie timelie conducted her to the Couent of the Frere Minors, there to heare Maſſe, and att the eleuation of the Bleſſed Sacrament her eyes were opened, and ſhe manifeſtly ſaw and adored it with the greateſt deuotion ſhe could with a loud voice crying out: I yeld thee infinite thankes my lord, and to thee ô glorious ſainct Francis, who haue permitted me to ſee the moſt ſacred body of my Redeemer IESVS CHRIST. Which the people there aſſembled, ſeeing and hearing, they all prayſed and thancked God for the ſame. The maſſe being ended, the people, in regard of this miracle, could not be ſatisfied with beholding this woman; for they all knew ſhe had bin blind. Retourning to her houſe ſhe gaue infinite thanckes to God, and to S. Francis, ſpending the reſt of her time very religiously.
                  In the plaines of Rome, there was in the citty of Poſta a child of fourteene yeares old, ſo afflicted in one of his eyes, that it slipt out of

the place, and for eight dayes together he was conſtrayned to hold in his hand the aple that hung by the ſinowes of the ſame eye, which being as withered hung out the length of a finger: The Phiſicians were ignorāt what to doe, for to cut it off, was very dangerous, and therfore they held it as a deſperat cure: but the Father who fainted with g

Francis, with a right confident faith required his helpe, wherin he was not deceaued, but graciously heard: for without other meane the eye of the child retourned into his firſt eſtate, and of dryed and withered as it was, became faire and cleerer then before, enoying a pure ſight, to the exceeding ioy, edification and conſolation, of all thoſe that vnderſtood therof.
               
               
                  Of other blind, reſtored to ſight by the vertue and merittes of the S.
                  THE XIV. CHAPTER.
                  
                     And an other. IN the plaines of Rome, in a towne called Magno, vpon the eue of S. Francis, a piece of timber falling from on high, ſtroake a Preiſt on the nape of the necke: the violence of which blow ſtroake the right eye out of his head, and by the force therof he alſo fell vnto the ground. But imploring the aid of S. Francis by theſe wordes: Holy Father helpe me, that I may be able to goe to thy feaſt, as I haue promiſed thy Religious, he incontinentlie aroſe ſound, and cured, his eye being retourned into his proper place, with as great contentment to thoſe preſent, as they had conceaued horrour att the accident. Therfore the more reuerentlie to ſhew themſelues thanckfull vnto God, they went in companie into his church, to celebrate his feaſt with this prieſt, who made publikely relation of the great compaſsion and vertue of this S. which in himſelfe he had experienced.
                  
                     Then an other. A man of Mount-Gargan, labouring in a vineyard, thincking to cutt a branch of a tree, cut one of his eyes in two pieces, one of which falling out of his place, hung downe to the depth of his iawes: whe
                        •

                     cis, vowing to faſt the eue of his feaſt, if he aſsiſted him in this extremitie, which he vttered ſo heartily and with ſo ſtrong a faith, that his prayers ended, the two pieces of his eye reioyned againe, and hisS. Franc. gaue ſight to one borne blind. ſight was as perfect as before, for which he gaue thanckes with great deuotion.
                  A gentlemans ſonne that was borne blinde, by the interceſsion of the glorious Father S. Francis receaued his ſight: for which great miracle, he attayning to conuenient age was called Illuminatus, who to ſhew

himſelfe gratefull as was requiſite, and to attaine greater perfection, became a Frere Minor, where he ſo profited in the light of the grace of God, that he ſeemed to be the ſonne of the true light, that illuminateth euery man of this world, and conformablie to his life alſo dyed very piouslie.

Francis appeared to one of them, &amp; ſaid: Goe to that gentleman who, in you receaueth God &amp; me, and tel him from me, that he is become blind, by reaſon of the ſinnes which he knoweth himſelfe to be guilty of, and wherof he would neuer be confeſſed: which ſaid he vaniſhed The Religious went to him, &amp; made fullAnd an other for his ſpiritual proſitt. relation therof vnto him, who reflecting on himſelfe, acknowledged that what the S. had reuealed of him was very true, whervpon being moued vnto perfect contrition, he made a generall confeſsion, with abondant effuſion of teares: and as ſoone as he had confeſſed all his ſinnes, he recouered his ſight. The bruit of this great miracle was generally ſpred, which ſtirred vp many, not only to deuotion towardes this holie Father, but euen to an entire confeſsion of their ſinnes, and to an entertainement of the poore of IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  Of many diſeaſed that were cured by the merittes of the glorious Father Sainct Francis.
                  THE XV. CHAPTER.
                  THere was in the village of Preue a poore boy both deafe and dumbe, from his birth, whoſe tongue was ſo ſhort &amp; litle that it ſeemed to ſuch as ſought it, to be cutt of. A gentleman calledGod reſtored ſpeech &amp; hearing to one by the interceſsiō of S. Fr. Marck, for the loue of God entertayned this poore boy, of whome he conceaued a great compaſsion in regard that he found him to be of a good diſpoſition. He often ſaid vnto his wife, that if the holy Father S. Francis would vouchſafe by his interceſsion to cure him, he would promiſe for the loue of God to entertayne him all the time of his life. The glorious S. lente not a deaſe eare to this pious intention, for the oblation being made, the boy began ſodenlie to haue his tongue att libertie and to ſpeake, ſaying glory be vnto God, and to the glorious Father S. Francis, who hath now giuen me my ſpeech and hearing: for which the gentleman and his wife no leſſe amazed then ioyfull, gaue infinite thanckes to God, performed the ſaid promiſe, and liued very ſpiritually; being alwayes mindfull of this miracle, and had a ſpeciall

care of the ſaid child, for the loue of God, and of his faithfull ſeruant S. Francis.

                     ort were manie perſons cured of the like infirmities by the merittes of this glorious Sainct, as Brother Bartholomew of Agubio, Brother Angelus of Todi, Syr Nicolas of Stichiam, Iohn de la Foye, a Piſan gentleman, one of the cittie of Ciperne, Peter Sicilian, a man of Spelle, nere vnto Aſsiſium, and many others cured of like diſeaſes, as alſo eſpecially Brother Angelus of Tudette, and a Preiſt of Sucane called Sir Nicolas, and an other alſo called Iohn de Fore, and a man of the citty of Piſe, an other of the citty of Ciſterne, and one of Fſpelle, one called Peter of Sicily, and infinite others, that were, by the mercie of God, and the merittes of bleſſed S. Francis, miraculously deliuered.
                  
                     He reſtored ſight and hearing, and cured a woman extremly tormented and afflicted. A woman of Maremme had bin about fiue yeares troubled in her ſpiritt, depriued of her ſight and hearing: yea was come to that point, that ſhe rent her garmentes with her teeth, and as enraged, feared neither fire, nor water, nor other danger, and as beſides fallen into that horrible diſeaſe of the falling ſicknes. This miſerable wretch it pleaſed the diuine Maieſty to fauour, and firſt to illuminate her interiourlie, for Sainct Francis one night appeared vnto her, ſitting verie eminentlie eleuated in a Royall ſeate, before whome falling one her knees, ſhe humbly prayed him to cure her. But the Sainct deferring to graunt her requeſt, ſhe redoubled her petition, therevnto adding a vow, and promiſed him that in the honour of God and him, ſhe would neuer whiles ſhe liued, deny an almoſe to any poore perſon, that ſhould demaund it of her, ſofar foorth as her ability would ſtretch, which Sainct Francis accepting, he made on her the ſigne of the croſſe, and ſhe was cured both of body and ſoule. Many others oppreſſed with like infirmities, haue bin cured by this compaſsionate Sainct and particulerly a yong mayden of Norcia, and the ſonne of a gentleman of the ſaid citty,

who were deliuered by almighty God, through the merittes and interceſsion of this his humble ſeruant.
               
               
                  Of other like miracles.
                  THE XVI. CHAPTER.
                  PEter of Fullignium, goeing as a Pilgrim, but with litle deuotion to viſitt the church of S. Michael the Archangell, and drincking water att a fountaine, the diuell entred into his bodie, and ſo tormented him that he was as it were vtterlie grinded, broaken,One poſeſſed was deliuered by the merits of S. Francis. cruſhed, and all black; he alwayes vttered abhominable matters, and vſed certaine geſtures that were dreadfull and fearfull to all the beholdeis. And being on day leſſe tormented then of ordinarie, he remembred to haue heard the meruailous worckes of ſainct Francis to be exceedinglie recommended, and particulerly that he deliuered ſuch as were poſſeſſed: He went vnto his Church, where with a profounde humilitie and deuotion, he approached vnto his holie ſepulchre, which hauing touched, he was miraculouslie deliuered of this oppreſsion, for which he ſhewed himſelfe thanckfull vnto God and S. Francis.
                  
                     And alſo an other. A gentlewoman of the citty of Narnie, afflicted by the deuill, was by the compaſsion of the ſainct deliuered, together with diuers others that were tormented by the deuill, which would be to long to committ to hiſtory.
                  
                     And an other. A gentleman of Fano called Bon, being afflicted with the palſey and leproſie, cauſed himſelfe to be conducted to the Church of Sainct Francis where he prayed him for his health, with ſuch inſtancie and faith that by the merittes of the ſainct he was heard of almightie God.
                  
                     And a woman of a mortal bloudy flux. A yong man called Accio of Saint Seuerin being a leaper, made a vow to the S. cauſed himſelfe to be carryed vnto his ſhrine, and was incontinentlie by his merittes deliuered. This glorious ſainct had many excellent vertues touching the dreſsing and curing of this diſeaſe: for he had deputed himſelfe vnto their ſeruice, for the loue he had to piety and Chriſtian humility.
                  A gentlewoman of the citty of Sora, called Rogata, for foure and twentie yeares, endured, with extreme affliction the bloudy flux, and this infirmitie was occaſion of other diſeaſes beſides: ſhe hauing bin long time tormented by the Phiſitians, and finding no eaſe, but a continuation of her greife, and diuerſitie of cruell diſeaſes, it reduced her euen to death: for when her flux was ſtayed, her

her legges, and all her body did ſweell, and whiles her flux continued, it did ſo afflict her that ſhe could not ſtand on her feet, ſo that this poore woman knew not what to doe other then to expect in ſhort time the end of her life; being in this perplexity, ſhe one day heard a yong man recoūt the merueilles ſo admirable which God had wrought, and did worck by the merittes of the glorious Eather ſainct Francis, which ſo moued her, that with abondant effuſion of teares, repleniſhed with faith and hope, ſhe began to ſay to her ſelfe: O glorious Sainct that art famous by ſo many miracles, if it would pleaſe thee to haue compaſsion of me, and to free me of mine inſupportable miſeryes, thou knoweſt how much the great glory of thy clemencie would therby be augmented; for it ſeemeth thou neuer diddeſt worckOne alſo

And together with her, a child of hers called Marck, maymed in one arme, who hauing vowed to the Sainct, was preſently cured.
                  
                     And an other of the flux. A Sicilian woman, hauing bin afflicted with the bloudy flux, was by the merittes of this ſtander-bearer of IESVS, cured therof. Praxede a Roman gentlewoman, famous for her ſanctity, in regard that ſhe had liued exemplary from her tender age, att which time for the loueHe cured S. Praxede of a dangerous fall. of her Spouſe IESVS CHRIST ſhe ſhutt her ſelfe for 40. yeares into a litle chamber: ſhe I ſay, was fauoured of ſainct Francis; for goeing one day vpon occaſion to the topp of her houſe, being ſurpriſed with an amazement of her head, ſhe fell downe and brake her foot and legge, and diſioynted hir ſhoulder: but the holy Father ſainct Francis incontinently appeared vnto her, enuironned with ſplendour and glory, and ſaid: Ariſe my daughter and feare not: then taking her by the hand, he lifted her vpright on her feet, and preſently the viſion diſappeared. This gentlewoman thus amazed, went about the houſe, conſidering with her ſelfe whither ſhe were cured, or that ſhe dreamed; and the greatnes of this miracle was ſuch, that albeit ſhe felt the truth therof, ſhe neuertheles called for a light, wherby ſhe aſſured her ſelfe that the diuine vertue by meane of ſainct Francis, had wrought this miracle in her, which ſhe related to her lay ſiſter, and afterwardes to diuers that did viſitt her.
               
               
                  
                  Of the merueillous chasticementes which God hath layd on thoſe that haue not kept and honoured the feaſt of this glorious S.
                  THE XVII. CHAPTER.
                  IN Poictou, in a village called Sime, there was a Preiſt named Sir Renald, very deuout vnto S. Francis, and therfore, aduertiſedA man refuſing to keepe the feast of S. Fr. had his handes fastened to his hatchett. his Pariſhioners of his feaſt, exhorting them to keep the ſame as of precept: but one of them hauing litle reſpect therof, went that day to cutt wood, and as he prepared himſelfe thervnto, he heard a voice that ſpake vnto him three ſeuerall times: Doe not worcke, for it is a feſtiuall day; but the indeuout fellow would no more obey the voice of God, then he had done the aduertiſſement of his Curat; and therfore the diuine power, for the glorie of the Sainct proceeded with correction: for this man lifting vp one hande to cutt a forck of wood which he held with the other, his left hand remayned faſtened to the wood, and the other to the iron, without power to moue his fingars: wherwith the wretch was ſo confounded, that not knowing what to doe, he reſolued to goe in that manner to the Church where the people were yet aſſembled, who beholding him in that eſtate, were extremely amazed att ſo ſtrange and vnwonted a puniſhment. But the miſerable fellow repenting his fault, and being admoniſhed by the Preiſt, he humbly fell on his knees before the aultar, and hartely recōmended himſelfe to the S. and according as he had bin thrice admoniſhed by the diuine voice, he made three vowes: the firſt was thenceforward to keep the feaſt; the ſecond, that during all his life he would be euer preſent on that day in the ſame church, to prayſe and honour God and S. Francis; the third that he would goe perſonally to viſitte his holy body att Aſsiſium. It was doubtleſſe a matter worthy and admirable for all the people aſſembled in that Church, to behold, that hauing made the ſaid firſt vow, one of his fingars was looſed from the iron inſtrument wherto his band was ioyned; hauing made the ſecond vow an other fingar was looſed; and after the third, not only the third fingar, but both his handes formerly faſtened, were abſolutely ſet att liberty. The people hauing ſeene the greatnes of this miracle deuoutly gaue thanckes vnto God together with the man deliuered, admiring the notable and ſinguler vertue of the S. that could ſo miraculously ſtrike and cure in one moment. The iron and wood wherto his handes were faſtened, doe to this preſent hang att an altare in the ſaid church, which was erected in honour of S. Francis and in memory of this miracle: many other miracles wrought in the ſaid place, and

that circuit demonſtrate how great the vertue and power of this glorious ſainct is in heauen, and how much he is to be honoured and reuerenced on earth.
                  In the citty of Mans, a woman refuſing to keep the feaſt of S. Francis, tooke her diſtaffe and ſpindle to ſpin: but endeauou

So the deuout Religious offering their deuotions for this woman, were heard: for ſhe was att the very inſtant cured of that extreme and inſupportable torment. There remayned only a ſigne as it were of a burning, in memorie of this miracle. Manie other like accidentes haue occured, as in the plaines of Rome, an other woman for refuſing to keep the feaſt of the Sainct. And in Spaine a man of Valladolid, together with an other woman in the cittie of Pilles: in which places the woman making no eſteeme of the feaſt of the Sainct, were rigou

                  A knight of Borgo in the contry of Maſſa, without feare or reſpect contemned the wonderfull miracles of S. Francis, offering many abuſes to the pilgrimes that went to viſitt the Church where his body repoſed▪ he euen impudently rayled againſt the Religious.

                     An other. A Iudge called Alexander, did not only condemne ſainct Francis and his ſinguler vertues: but did euen with all poſsibility endeauour to withdraw his holy reputation from the opinion of men: in reſpect wherof by diuine permiſsion he inſtantly became mute, and ſo remayned for ſix yeares: att the end wherof acknowledging that he had bin puniſhed in that member wherby he had offended, he was ſo penitent for his crime, that he appeaſed the indignation of God and of

the mercifull Sainct in ſuch ſort that his ſpeech retourned, for which he was thanckfull to God and to the Sainct his interceſſour: he failed not thenceforward to conſecrate that tongue of his, which he had abuſed in blaſphemy, to the praiſe and benediction of God and the glorious Father S. Francis, to whome the ſaid puniſhment had made him exceeding deuout.
               
               
                  Of ſome other miracles wrought by this glorious S.
                  THE XVIII. CHAPTER.
                  IN the Borough Gallian of the dioceſe of Cales, there was a woman called Marie, who with great deuotion ſpent her time inOne deuout vnto S. Fr. miraculouſly obteined water in her neceſsity. the ſeruice of God, and was merueillouslie deuouted vnto ſainct Francis; ſhe one day conſtrayned by neceſsitie, went foorth of her houſe, in a verie hote ſeaſon, ſeeking her 
                        •
                     iuing by labour; and being vpon a litle hill ſhe was exceeding wearie, as well through her ordinarie abſtinēces, as by the preſent extremitie of the heat, and therwithall being verie thirſtie, ſhe ſate downe on the ground in that anxietie void of all comfort; and being there reduced nere vnto death, ſhe with a deuout ſpiritt called on her Aduocate, and humbly perſeuering in her prayer, with wearines ſhe fell a sleep. Now God who alwayes aſsiſteth them that truelie putt their confidence in him ſent the glorious Sainct to her that was deuout vnto him, who incontinently awaking her, called her by name, ſaying: Mary, ariſe, and drinck of the water that by diuine grace is graunted to thee and to many. This woman hearing the voice, with an incredible force aroſe on her feet, and hauing taken a ſtone out of the ground which the S. in her dreame had ſhewed her, and a litle ſtirred the earth with a ſtaffe, there ſprung out a water moſt cleare and of a very delightfull taſt, which afterward by the will of God grew to a great fountaine. Thus did this woman quench her thirſt, recomfort her forces, and waſhing her eyes which had bin long time bleared and dimme, they were thenceforward moſt pure and cleare, wherwith exceedingly cōforted ſhe retourned to her houſe, manifeſting to each one this great miracle to the glory of God and to the ſaid Sainct, ſo that this miraculous fountaine being diuulged, the people flocked thither from far off, the water therof was proued to be of greater force and vertue then other waters, in ſuch ſort that ſuch as repayred thither with deuotion to ſee this miracle, confeſſed and contrite, drincking of the water, were cured of their infirmities: This fountaine is yet extant in the ſaid place, where is

                  THE XX. CHAPTER.
                  
                     S. Franc. cured one deuout vnto him of an incurable diſeaſe in his legge. THere was a man in the towne of Chora within the dioceſſe of Hoſtia, which was ſo depriued of the force and ſtrength of one foot, that he could neither goe nor any way moue the ſame: wherefore deſpairing by humane art to cure him, he began one night to diſcourſe with S. Francis as if he had bin preſent, complayning before his altare in theſe wordes. S. Francis helpe me, remember what I haue done in thy ſeruice, carrying thee with ſuch deuotion on my aſſe, I haue kiſſed thy holy handes and feet, and haue bin euer moſt deuout vnto thee; I loue thee cordiallie, conſider therfore how I am tormented with this extreme paine. The holy Father, as approuing his diſcourſe was moued with his iuſt and pious complaintes, and as one that hath a continuall memory of thoſe deuout vnto him, he appeared with one of his Religious to his freinde, euen whiles he was waking, and ſaid: Sith thou haſt called on me, I come to thee bringing wherwithall to cure thee: then comming neere him he touched his place of paine with a litle ſtaffe, wheron was the figure of the ſigne Tau, the Greek letter thus made in forme of a croſſe, and preſentlie the apoſtume brake out of his legge, and his paine ceaſſed, the ſaid man remayning perfectlie cured, and that which more augmented the miracle was, that in the place where his griefe was, the ſigne of Tau remaynedWhat was the ſeale of S. Franc. for memory of the ſame. It was the ſeale wherwith the holy Father S. Francis ſealed his letters, when he wrote to his freindes concerning any worck of charity. Now here is to be obſerued, that whiles we diſcourſe of the diuerſe miracles of this glorious ſainct, it happeneth

God forbid that I ſhould glory, ſauing in the croſſe of our Lord IESVSGal. 6. CHRIST: as alſo afterward, he might truely ſay, of his Rule: Peace vpon them and mercy that ſhall follow this Rule: but towardes the end, he might more truely ſay with the ſaid Apoſtle: I beare the marckes of our Lord IESVS in my body: and we ſhould deſire to heare thoſe other wordes from him: The grace of our Lord IESVS CHRIST be with your ſpiritt brethren. Amen. Thē mayeſt thou O glorious ſtanderd-bearer of IESVS CHRIST, moſt aſſuredly glory in the glory of the croſſe of IESVS CHRIST, becauſe thou diddeſt begin by the croſſe, and finally end by the croſſe, and for teſtimonie of the croſſe it hath bin manifeſted to all the faithfull, how glorious thou now art in heauen: ſo that we may ſecurelie follow them that depart out of this cruell Egipt, becauſe the red ſea being diuided by the wood of the croſſe, they paſſed the deſertes to enter into the land promiſed to the liuing, leauing behinde them the floud Iourdan of mortality, by the merueillous carryer of this holy croſſe: to the which bleſſed land of the the liuing, the infallible guide of our beloued IESVS CHRIST crucified, conduct vs, by the degrees of the ladder following, his glorious ſeruant being our Interceſſour.
                  Here end the miracles of the glorious Father Sainct Francis written by Sainct Bonauenture.
               
               
                  
                  A treatiſe wherin is diſcourſed, how the holy Father ſainct Francis attayned to perfect contemplation, which hath bin transferred hither from the 37. chapter, to the end of the tenth booke, this place being more proper there vnto.
                  THE I. CHAPTER.
                  IT ſeemeth here to good purpoſe, in ſome ſort to declare the order and degrees, wherby the holy Ghoſt doth raiſe thoſe that are his to this great and high vnion of ſpiritt with God, as well for a more true relation and intelligence of the perfect contemplation and vnionLib. 14. chap. 18. which the glorious Father S. Francis had with God, as for the greater comfort of the ſoules who deſire to follow and imitate his life and exerciſe. Now it is to be noted, according to the doctrine of S. Auguſtin, that men lay two foundations, the one of perdition which is ſelfe-loue, and the other of ſaluation which is the loue of God; or elſe that men haue two endes, ſome, in God, and others in themſelues, directing all their actions for themſelues; our will is gouerned according to theſe two endes: for if it conuert it ſelfe vnto God, as taking him for its end, the more it diſioyneth it ſelfe from creatures, yea from it ſelfe, the neerer doth it approach vnto God by obedience and charity; and perhappes with diuine aſsiſtance, to the perfect contempt and abnegation of it ſelfe, and to transforme it ſelfe entirely into the loue of God which is our end, wherin conſiſteth all our perfection and glory. Our Maſter IESVS CHRIST left vs this rule in his holy ghoſpell, ſaying: If any manMatt. 16. will come after me, lett him deny himſelfe, lett him know how much he is deceaued that eſteemeth himſelfe of any worthe, lett him hate, and dye in himſelfe, that he may know me, loue, and liue in me, and I in him. And as the nature of fire is to aſcend on high, ſo the nature of a ſoule free and disburdened from the waight of ſelfe and naturall affection, is to mount and aſcend into God, which is her proper place where ſhe was created, to repoſe in him bleſſedly perfect and eternall: As it is the nature of a ſtone by meane of his naturall waight to decline vnto his center; ſo is it naturall to the hart loaden with loue of it ſelfe and other creatures to fall by his owne fault into hell. Lett the ſoule then that ſhall haue placed all his end in God, and deſireth to aſcend to the throne of grace of the true Salomon IESVS GHRIST, who being a moſt gracious and peaceable king, fitteth art the right hand of his Father, in whome all the deſires of Angels and glorious ſoules are abſolutelie effected; lett that ſoule, I ſay, behold in this dayes exerciſe, the ladder of Iacob, whoſe hight toucheth the heauen, and that ſhe the more eaſely, and with better order aſcend, ſhe may make ſeauen ſeuerall degrees or ſteppes, which are ſo diſpoſed by Vbertin. The firſt

is the taſt, the ſecond the deſire, the third ſatiety, the fourth exceſſeSeauen degrees of perfection. or ſpirituall extaſie, the fift aſſeurance, the ſixt tranquility, God only knoweth the name of the ſeauenth. We attaine to the knowledge of theſe degrees and exerciſes, rather by the effectes and actions, as it is in other ſpirituall thinges, then of themſelues, they being perceiued with ſpirituall eyes, wherto althinges are apparant, but eſpecially thoſe that concerne the ſweet effectes and graces therof. The ſoule therfore that will profitt in them, the more that ſhe ſhall finde her ſight cleare to know her weakenes, ſhall correct her faultes, and ſhall perſeuer in mortification and exerciſe of worckes of charity, ſo much leſſe ſight, ſhall ſhe haue to caſt her eyes on the degree or on the height of her perfection, leauing the care therof to God alone, imploying her ſelfe onlie in her humility; he that hath any litle knowledge of ſpirituall thinges, will eaſilie comprehend, that to ſearch after that which appertayneth only to God, to witt, to labour for perfection and not for mortification; that it followeth therof that there are ſo few truely ſpirituall and that deſerue this name, though many by their profeſsion or exerciſe, pretend ſo to be.
               
               
                  Of the firſt degree and exerciſe of contemplation.
                  THE II. CHAPTER.
                  THe firſt degree then of contemplation, as we haue ſaid, is the taſt, wherof Dauid ſeemeth to ſpeake when the ſaith: Taſt and ſee how ſweet God is: bleſſed is he that hath put all his hope in him. The Prophett ſpeaketh to ſmners, who thinck to haue no other gaine nor taſt but of the world. Taſt yee ſinners ſaith he, and ſee your errours, and you ſhall know what you looſe euen in this life. And as the firſt ſteppe of the ladder raiſeth a man from the earth, ſo the exerciſe of this firſt degree, is to ſequeſter one from ſinnes and the indirect way, and to looſe the taſt of lewd wordlie contentementes, yea to hate and deteſt them, ſo to receaue the taſt, which God giueth to the ſoule, of a cleare conſcience. Therfore his diuine Maieſtie to draw vnto him the ſoule accuſtomed to ſenſnall thinges, giueth vnto her ſpirituall conſolations in the beginning, for it would be verie difficult to draw the cold and feeble ſoule to diuine thinges, without this new taſt which is giuen her of God as a ſenſible Manna: and therfore the other exerciſes of this eſtate are true contrition, frequent confeſsion, full ſatisfaction, and moſt profound acknowledgement of ones owne fault, ingratitude, malice, and rash preſumption againſt God: Of which thinges proceed

deſires to ſatisfy the diuine iuſtice: for ſatisfaction in other reſpectes ſhould already be done, being neuer wearyed wi
                        •
                     h ſighing and repenting to haue offended God, and ſo with a feruent zeale of iuſt correction for God, to addict himſelfe to penance, to faſtinges, diſciplines, auſterities and wachinges, labouring with great patience, to offer ſuch prayers as proceed rather from the hart then the mouth. And becauſe it will ſeeme difficult to the penitent to performe this, appearing repugnant to his nature, he muſt endeauour to prepare and enable his hart by pious cogitations and meditations, and by the remembrance and taſt of God, as to thinck on death, on the generall iudgement, on the feare therof, on hell and the paine therof, one Paradicice and the glory therof, on the benefittes and graces of his diuine Maieſty, as well in generall as in particular beſtowed on all perſonnes, and aboue all, lett him not forgett the paſsion of our Lord IESVS CHRIST as a ſoueraigne benefitt of God beſtowed on vs, wherin conſiſteth all our conſolation and hope. When the ſinner calleth to minde his great ingratitude towardes God, in as much as lyeth in him by his ſinnes crucifying him againe, and after he had bin ſo deerly redeemed with his precious bloud and moſt cruell death, deſtroying himſelfe againe by yelding himſelfe to the deuill, to the great miſpriſe and contempt of his God, he cannot but carrie a great hatred to his ſinnes, and deſire to doe great penance: therfore that he no more erre from the way of God, he conſidereth how he ought to liue, he ſequeſtreth himſelfe frome idle and vnprofitable conuerſations; he ſmothereth peruerſe inclinations, and appetites, endeauouring to gett an hatred of his owne affection, a contempt of the world, and finally a victory of him ſelfe to yeld himſelfe abſolutely vnto God, IESVS CHRIST taught this firſt degree to his ſeruant Francis. when appearing vnto him att the beginning of his conuerſion he told him that it was neceſſarie for him to chaung the corrupted and infected taſt which he had, and to make him finde taſt in that which till then he had miſpriſed, and that what ſoeuer he had ſound pleaſing ſhould proue diſtaſtfull and bitter. I know not indeed of what Sainct are recorded greater exercices in this ſeparation, deeper foundation of penance, and more labours then of him; and doubles it was requiſite for him, for he was to aſcend vnto ſuch a perfection, and to be an example in the church, to fly the world, to make his habitation in ſolitary places, and deſert woodes, to renounce monie, and his fathers patrimonie euen to this ſhirt, to diſplaint himſelfe from his kinred and freindes, from conuerſations, and ordinarie courſes of life, euen by the root, to tranſ-plant himſelfe into God, and with ſuch courage that it was not needfull for him to fly into the deſert

thenceforward to ſequeſter him ſelfe from the world. He powered out an abondant quantitie of teares and ſighes, with a feeling cōpaſsion meditating on the paſsion of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, wherof he learned to liue in ſuch nuditie, faſtinges and intollerable labours, and to haue patience in ſuch and ſo manie contempts, and thence alſo proceeded his deſires dailie to encreaſe his penance, and to ſupport the greateſt affrontes for the loue of God. All theſe thinges and many other, did not only enrich his ſoule, remouing her from all worldlie and ſenſuall taſt, but did procure in him euen a diſtaſt of all thinges preſent, yea cauſed diuine thinges to be afterward more aggreable vnto him, and God alwayes conſerued him in this eſtate, and appeared often times vnto, would alſo afterward permitte him greater afflictions and poſſeſſe him with greater croſſes, for he prepared him to be a valiant and inuincible Captaine of his penitentes, and an example of perfect and couragious warryers; and alſo told him that the kingdome of heauen ſhould ſuffer violence,Matt. 11. and that the violent ſhould beare it a way, not thoſe of tender and delicates ſpirittes.
               
               
                  Of the ſecond degree, to arriue to perfection, called Deſire.
                  THE III. CHAPTER.
                  
                     Hom. 30. vpon the Goſpels. THe ſecond degree is deſire, for as ſainct Gregoire, ſaith, diuine thinges being taſted are deſired, and not taſted, ſeeme without ſauour: in worldly matters it is contrary, for the deſire therof is alwayes beſt. There groweth in the ſoule ſo extreme a hungar, and a ſuch a thirſt after this taſt, and after a triall of this diuine ſweetnes, that no creature or temporall conſolation can ſatisfie her but God alone, whome ſhe loueth: And becauſe ſhe neither can, nor doth yet deſerue to obtaine the food of the great, knowing her owne infirmitie and litle meritt, ſhe remayneth greedilie hungrie after temporall thinges, and beggeth the mites of the table of God, ſeeking them on earth, meditating on his life and conuerſation, worckes and examples, yea ſhe ſeeketh them in his creatures where his ſteppes, markes and traces are repreſented vnto her, and in his Sainctes where ſhe findeth moſt euident teſtimonyes of her God, and often times ſhe heareth his voice and ſeeth his preſence, and this eſtate is like to that, wherof the eſpouſe ſpeaketh in the Canticles: I adiure you, ifCant. 50. you finde my beloued, to tell him that I languiſh and looſe my

ſelfe for his loue. It is alſo expedient in this eſtate to make ſimplicityes in worckes and wordes, for the great exceſſe of new deſires, as new ſpirituall wine: of theſe deſires, when thy are reall, doth grow, the imitation of the life of IESVS CHRIST, and of his humility, as much as may be, that he may be found and poſſeſſed: In that reſpect doth our Lord call himſelfe the path and way, for we muſt walke by him, and his ſteppes are, as himſelfe affirmeth, humility, meeknes, patience charity, prayers, and finally his croſſe and paſsion; for the ſeruant is notIoan. 14. &amp; 15. greater then his Lord, nor the diſciple aboue his maſter. This is the ſomme of whatſoeuer may be ſaid or written. It is the light of the diuine will, wherin conſiſteth the rule and leſſon of true wiſdome. It is the ſhorteſt and ſecureſt way that we can walke, which openeth and diſcouereth vnto vs the moſt eminent maſter of truth, wherin walking, he taught men what way they ſhould vndertake. Lett no man thinck that there is an other way more direct, to obtaine of God true charity, then that of labours and the exerciſes of vertues. This exerciſe conſiſteth in three pointes: the firſt, with a ſincere hart to demaund of God the knowledge of ones offences mortall, and veniall; together with an interiour ſorrow for them, and a ſhunning of all occaſions of mortall ſinnes, and diſtraction of ſpiritt: the ſecond, to deſire the good of our neighbour, as our owne, for whome God hath ſo much endured, and to aſsiſt him corporally and ſpiritually in our prayers, praying for our freindes, and ennemies, and for all thoſe whome God will haue prayed for: the third, is to deſire with a firme reſolution to imitate the life of IESVS CHRIST in his conuerſation, as well in body as ſpiritt, and to demaund of God that he will vnite him to his ſonne, and that nothing may be found in his bowels but IESVS CHRIST crucified, demaunding alſo the vertues that may in anyſort make vs like vnto IESVS CHRIST, as pouerty, humility, and ſimplicity, for in this manner exerciſing our ſelues in theſe vertues, we attaine a true and feruent deſire, and a true thirſt of the loue of our Saulour IESVS CHRIST, and it wilbe no paine or trouble vnto vs to be exerciſed in them, therbie to obtaine the good which wee deſire.
                  The glorious Father S. Francis, aſcended to this degree, when with a feruent and perſeuerant deſire, demaunding and finding his deare and beloued Lord, the Euangelicall perfection, and the Apoſtolicall life were reuealed vnto him, and as if he had thenceforward began, he couered himſelfe with one only garment ſhaped in forme of a croſſe, deſiring no other thing then IESVS CHRIST crucified, eſteeming himſelfe neuer ſatisfied with pouerty, humility, and miſpriſe, to imitate his Sauiour I.

Therfore ouercomming our ſelues, we ſhall triumph ouer all our potent ennemies: he endeauoured by examples of euery kind of vertue and with zeale of the ſaluation of ſoules, for which I. C. ſuffered, to draw them to the eſtate of Euangelicall perfection, he did not exerciſe his diſciples, but in the imitation of the pouertie humilitie and patience of IESVS CHRIST, and the meditation of his paſsion: for he wel knew that the more vertues we poſſeſſe, the greater progreſſe doe we make in prayer, and without the ſame none att all, ſuch were his ceremonies and mortifications, ſuch the edifices and exerciſes of his firſt order, to finde I. C. in continuall labour, abſtinences, and prayers, and to carry the woundes of our Lord I. C. in his body, with the difficulty of ſtrict pouerty, and with this innocencie, purity and Chriſtian ſimplicity, he ſurpaſſed thoſe that are cloathed only with the exteriour leaues of ceremonies, to vndertake the way of perfection: and checked thoſe that cloathed themſelues exteriourly with the ſaid ceremonies, only to couer their imperfections.
               
               
                  Of the third degree of perfection, called Satiety.
                  THE IV. CHAPTER.
                  THe third degree, is Satiety, when the ſoule commeth to loath terreſtriall thinges, richeſſe, honoures, yea the repoſe of his owne life, reſpecting all as nought, conceauing a dislike to ſee, or ſpeake of any worldlie matters, for whereas the ſoule doeth loue &amp; deſire only God, and findeth no repoſe but in him, hauing experience that the creatures hinder his ſeruice, though louing them vnder pretext of deuotion, they all neuertheles ſeeme diſpleaſing, and withall knowing that all humane affections and motions, all liberall artes &amp; ſciences, all ſubtility of ſpirittes, all exquiſite theologie, and other curious ſciences, cannot giue peace nor ſatiate our hart, if they be vſed with pride, and that only the diuine loue can performe the ſame in an humble hart, and mortified in his proper deſires and opinions, which will not be ſurpriſed more or leſſe, in any other thing, nor affecteth other power or knowledge, then how to loue his God, and how to ridde himſelfe of all vaine cogitations, and of his proper complacence and curioſity to

comprehend lofty and ſecrett matters, and to proceed in a ſingularitie of life and exerciſes: the property of this eſtate, is to ſupport the tentations, the terrours and deceiptes of the deuils becauſe our ſoule reſiſtethEpheſ. 6. not fleſh and bloud only, but the ſpirittes and powers of darcknes▪ ſurmounting all other creatures, yea himſelfe, and poſſeſsing God alone in his only deſire. Our ſoule hath an other property, not only ſeeking &amp; thenceforward finding her beloued in creatures, by meditations and imaginations, framed by the vnderſtanding, but often, without attending and knocking att the dote, the feruent deſires &amp; enflamed ſighes which ſhe breatheth out for her loue, conducteth her in, and then ſhe conuerſeth with and freely heareth her God, becauſe ſhe incontinētlie arriueth to that eſtate, wherof our Lord IESVS CHRIST ſpake: I call you noIoan. 15. longer ſeruantes, but freindes: ſuch are the effects of feruent loues that tranſport the ſoule into God, to make her one ſpiritt with him and one will, and as this loue is ſupernaturall and diuine, incomparablie of more efficacie then the naturall, it doth conſequentlie with a faſtened knott and bond of charity, conioyne the ſpiritt with God: So that we may ſay, in this eſtate ſuch a loue worcketh three effectes or offices; The firſt, to depriue the ſoule of all kind and quality of loue, except the loue of God, that ſhe may no more be diſioyned from him, conformablieRom. 8. to thoſe wordes of the Apoſtle ſainct Paul: No man can hereafter ſeparate vs from the charity and loue of our Lord IESVS CHRIST. The ſecond is, to giue no place to idlenes, for as ſaith the moral ſainct Gregory. He that is idle loueth not, and therfore his worck is to labour with an appetite ſweet and ſauourous in God, and to run vnto him withall his hart, as to his ſoueraigne Good, and to keep his ſpiritt ſetled and combined in him, continually enflaming his deſires to a cruell and continuall warre, vpon ſuch diſcord, that can neuer haue peace with the cares, diſordinate paſsions, and naturall deſires, which labour to ſatiate him in other places, wheras this loue endeauoureth att leaſt to keep him alwayes concerning the memorie and the deſires, being ſeparated from all terreſtriall cares and conuerſations, with the feare of the ſtaine which veniall diſorders leaues in the ſoule, and the impediment which they procure to the continuall amourous affection of God, which cauſeth the ſoule eſpecially to loue and deſire ſolitude, and to be ſequeſtred from all creatures; for as the Adamant draweth iron vnto it, ſo God, being loued, draueth vnto him the louer into a ſolitarie place, and ſequeſtreth him from humane conuerſation, that he may taſt diuine. The third office whence this ſecond proceedeth, is that this loue neuer ceaſſeth to growe no otherwiſe then fire, which hauing matter, neuer faileth to encreaſe. As then our Lord I. C. is infinitely worthy to be loued, and

that charity alwayes findeth in him matter to encreaſe, and more and more euery hower to dilate it ſelfe, ſo this augmentation of loue hath neuer end in this life, ſo that the proper office of this loue is, to conſtraine a man to make progreſſe in his perfection of life, and with a continuall warre, againſt luke warmneſ

                     e.
                  It is eaſie to be collected in diuers places out of the Legend, rule and life of S. Frācis, how much this degree of loue and perfection made him alwayes ioyfull, and content in his pouerty: it there appeareth how much he abhorred and ſhunned the honours and contentments of the world, and with what vnion of ſpiritt he conceaued taſt and ſatisfaction in prayer; For this occaſion he would that his Religious ſhould be alwayes ioyfull exteriourly and interiourly, as men contented in the true graces which they receaued of the mercie of God; this ſatiety which he had in God, hindered him from deſiring ſciences and honours for his Religion, as the greedy of this world deſire and procure, but he would that only the pouerty, and humility of his Lord I. C. ſhould alwayes be, and ſhine in his Order, and that there one ſhould neuer ſatisfie and content himſelfe enough, in the following, imitating and louing of I. C. The wicked ſpirittes could not not endure this loue that burned in him perpetually, and therfore they neuer omitted to tempt and terrifie him; endeauouring to diſtract him; but finding nothing in him wherof to take hold, he being naked and depriued of all earthely thinges; they preſumed by their horrours and terrours to make him ſtopp and tourne his courſe. The continuall lentes which he kept in perpetual ſilence, and in ſolitarie places, diſcouer how incomparable he was, and his continuall feruour, in the exerciſe of prayer, and ſpirituall profitt in all kind of vertues, as alſo his ordinarie watchfulnes ouer his ſences and his body, likewiſe his manner of life alwayes apart, except when he trauelled for the ſaluation of ſoules, as one that had in God alone his repoſe and ſatiety.
               
               
                  Of the fourth degree, to aſcend vnto perfection, called ſpirituall Exceſse or Extaſie.
                  THE V. CHAPTER.
                  THe fourth degree, is extaſie, ſpirituall exceſſe, or dronkennes of ſpiritt, which proceedeth of the ſatiety of the ſoule, made droncken with the diuine loue of the Holy Ghoſt, without any water of our imaginations, and humane fantaſies, which forſake vs not without difficulty, if God take not the ſoule by the hand &amp; draw it vnto

him, cauſingal the ſences to remaine without, depriued of their functiō, the ſoule being imployed ſecretly with her God, yea it ſee meth to the ſoule that ſhe endureth the like, for being with God, ſhe is more aboue then in her ſelfe, and therfore ſeeing ſhe ſeeth not; and feeling ſhe feeleth not. For ſhe being pure and cleare from all corporall images which are her irons, and the matter of her prayers, ſhe feeleth only the effectes, with the worckes of the diuine preſence and charity. And therfore he that is rayſed to this degree of perfection, doth accuſtome to exerciſe leſſe meditations, how pious ſoeuer, vſing them only, to creat in his ſoule admirations, deuotions, and feruours towardes his beloued God, drawing the ſparckes of loue from his hart with thoſe meditations as with a perfect fire-ſteele, which moſt commonly is in men more hard then a flint-ſtone, for as the way of the vnderſtanding proceedeth not of humane ſtile, though it be directed vnto God, the knowledge notwithſtanding proceeding in the ſoule, by the loue and the will, its charity is neuer ſo intentiue in the contemplatiue life, and in the proper mortification as vnto the exerciſe of vertues, neither is this kinde of ſeeking and aſcending to the admiration and deuotion of God, ſo perfect, it is more ordinary in the learned and prudent perſonnes and of ſubtill ſpiritt, in whome the intelligence proceedeth alwayes vnto the will, and this loue, by meditation and conſideration: But the affectiue way is farre more breife to aſcend vnto God: the principall therin is the will, for ſhe hath her exerciſes ordinarily in deſires, in inſpirations, and interiour ſighes in verie frequent manner vnto her beloued, which ſhe performeth by iaculatorie prayers, more ardent then long meditations of the ſpiritt, wherof although ſhe make vſe as of the foundation, as it were to recomfort her owne infirmitie, ſhe notwithſtanding vſeth them, to raiſe the ſoule to her God, by a deſire of loue, which encreaſing, ſhe vſeth the action of the will which is to loue, becauſe it hath more entrie with God then the action of the vnderſtanding, which is to know the way verie breife for perfection, and eaſy to practiſe, becauſe it needeth neither ſcience nor many bookes, in which the moſt ſimple idiot profiteth much more then the learned, God diſpoſing according to his liberality, that the ſoule of him who ſeeketh him without meane, be rather inſtructed by him vnto his conuerſation: but this inſtruction is perticulerlie neceſſarie to them that are alreadie arriued to the loue which cauſeth them the extaſies, to the end they ſetle not all their perfection in the deuotion and ſenſible taſt which they receaue (for finally it is an inſtrument only for ſpirituall charity) and that thoſe impetuoſities of deuotion, and ſubtill conceited actes, make them not preſumptuous, becauſe this matter may be obtayned by

naturall exerciſe, and without grace: But lett them diligentlie regard and conſider in themſelues if they receaue this diuine grace with fruit, and if they profitt in true mortification, and abnegation of their proper will, ſo that it be prompt to execute the diuine will, receauing with patience and contentment of hart, what ſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe God to ordaine, as well in exteriour as interiour labours, euen the loſſe of conſolations, yea temptations: For if it ſeeme to them that they are leſſe obliged to theſe later then the other, they will haue no care to ſeeke the exerciſe of vertues, but will apply all their endeauour to gett this ſweetnes of deuotion; though they fall into extaſy ſeauen times in a day, they will profitt litle; and will abuſe the diuine grace wrongfully and to their damnation; for they ſatisfie their pleaſure with more diligence, then the will of God, and ſuch ſhall finde in themſelues rather, paſsionate cogitations, and wordes of preſumpſumption, eſteeming themſelues perfect, and reſting aſſured to be in the way of perfection, iudgeing others that walke not their way to proceed erroniously, then to haue true feare and humility. The property then of this way, is when without deceipt, as God ſendeth mentall extaſies vnto the ſoule, eleuating her to the imbracementes of diuine loue, ſo the ſoule being retourned to her ſelfe, worcketh merueillous exceſſes of humility and patience, the example of all vertues, and particulerly in the amourous compaſsion of the paſsion of IESVS CHRIST, whoſe exceſsiue tormentes being contemplated by the ſoule, ſhe burneth, and cannot conteine hir in her ſelfe, for the great apprehenſion which ſhe hath of ſuch a charity, which is ſuch, as ſhe deſireth to repay IESVS CHRIST this his glorious death, by her owne life expoſed to martyrdome.
                  We may coniecture in what perfection this degree of the loue of the holy Ghoſt, eleuated S. Francis, wrought by frequent and exceſsiue corporall deuotions, wherin he was ſwallowed vp, being a figure of many greater eminent conceated worckes of the ſpiritt, ſo that for the moſt feruent loue he carryed to IESVS CHRIST crucified, he trauelled to ſeeke martyrdome. But becauſe his admirable exceſſes of prayer, humility, and other vertues, haue bin already recorded, it is not neceſſary to repeat them, it ſufficeth to haue only refreſhed the memory of the readers therwith, as with a matter worthy to be noted.
               
               
                  Of the fift degree of perfection, called Aſseurance.
                  THE VI. CHAPTER.
                  THe fift degree is called aſſeurance becauſe hauing in the precedent eſtate taſted feruent chariry, it expelleth all feare out of the ſoule,

which doth not repute her ſelfe only reſigned and perfectly ſetled, as much as is poſsible for her, in the diuine will and diſpoſition, but doth euen deſire really and with ſeruour to expoſe her ſelfe to all labours, to conforme her ſelfe to her laboured IESVS CHRIST, and ſo ſhe remayneth without cauſe of feare: for albeit God ſhould caſt her into hell, the ſame ſhould be her glory, it being the will of God: and beſides, ſhe hath ſuch a ſtrong hope, and aſſured perſuaſion of the grace and fauour of her God, that it is impoſsible for her to be ſeparatedRom. 8. from him, ſaying with S. Paul: For I am ſure that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, neither thinges preſent, nor thinges to come, neither might, nor height, nor depth, nor other creature, ſhalbe able to ſeparate vs from the charity of God which is in IESVS CHRIST our lo
                        •
                     d. Let vs therfore know that this word Aſsurance is rather a name accidental, &amp; of the effect this eſtate, then eſſential; becauſe the root and eſſence therof, is the coniunctiue loue, which the ſoule poſſeſſeth: but becauſe this name hath a ſecrett and hidden ſignification, though diuers know it not, which is manifeſt only to God, &amp; the ſoule wherin it worcketh this merueillous vnion, we haue ſignified it by the name of the effect; wherby the ſoule attayneth to make her ſelfe a ſpiritt, by the cōtinuall norriture of grace and charity, &amp; by the merueillous vniō of her loue with God. For as a droppe of water mingled with wine, looſeth its nature, &amp; aſſumeth that of wine, as alſo the coulour and ſauour; ſo the ſoule that perfectly loueth in this degree, falling into the infinite diuine charity, without yet looſing her nature, is conuerted into the diuine loue, according to the office and inſtitutiō of life, and all herA worthy ſimilitud. powers remayne confected in the taſt of the loue of God: &amp; albeit our nature is not chaunged in this diuine vnion touching her naturall eſſēce, yet doth it chaūge many inclinations &amp; cōditions, &amp; obtayneth others, beyond the forces of nature created, as we ſee the fi
                        •
                     e worcketh in iron, which it depriueth of the hardnes, coldnes, and blacknes, which are proper vnto it, &amp; endueth it with other cōtrary and more excellēt qualities, yet without chaūging the nature therof: ſo the ſoule farre more enflamed &amp; vnited in the diuine loue, being endued with other life, motiō &amp; force, remayneth without any feare or dulneſſe &amp; without diffidēce, ſo light and eaſy to trāsforme it ſelfe into God her beloued, by a vnitiue deſire, as the diuine fire that burneth in her, and maketh her in that manner feruēt in her ſpirituall operations; in ſuch ſort the ſoule remayneth filled with this diuine vnion, &amp; repleniſhed with ſo great feruour, that ſhe att their firſt arriuall putteth to flight the flyes of contrary tēptations; and doth more annihilate and mortifie her ſelfe in one act of the will, then others can doe in much time. She likewiſe receaueth a penetratiue vertue to participate with all creatures, without any impedimēt becauſe ſhe eaſily

is vnited to her God; thus doth ſhe diſpoſe her ſelfe to receaue greater grace of God, becauſe ſhe approacheth neerer, and is rayſed vnto the perpetuall fountaine, and to the Father of lightes, the eternall God. The property of this eſtate of Aſſeurance, is to haue God alwayes in her hart preſent in euery place, neuer ſeparating her ſelfe frō him: which ſhe performeth by meane of a liuing loue, and cōtinuall memory of him: for ſhe is preſent, &amp; liueth in his armes, freed frō all action, ſauing that wherin her beloued God employeth her, he being euer preſēt with her. The holy Father knew that he had attayned this degree of vnitiue loue, in the cōtinuall memory, and diuine cōmunication, which he had without diſturbance, as well in the Monaſteries as in hermitages, alone and in company, were he employed in the doctrine of ſaluation of ſoules, or in prayer: And it was euen apparant that the holy Father S. Francis had obtained this degree of perfection, in the conuerſion of his ſences, powers, and inclinations into God: for he ſeemed to be retourned into the ſtate of innocencie, ſo much were his interiour powers ſubmitted to the empire and domination of the ſoule, which was ſo perfectly vnited vnto her God in the light and frequent reuelations which ſhe receaued of the diuine preſence, whence proceeded that he gloryed in his labours, and in merueillous aſſeurance of his ſaluation, which was by ſpeciall diuine grace reuealed vnto him.
               
               
                  Of the ſixtdegre of perfection, called Tranquility.
                  THE VII. CHAPTER.
                  THe eſtate of perfection called Tranquility, is in the ſixt degree where there is ſuch peace and contentment, that the ſoule liueth as it were in ſilence and repoſe as in a sleepy slumber on the breſt of God, ſo that ſhe may ſay with S. Paul: that ſhe no more liueth in herſelfe, but that IESVS CHRIST liueth and raigneth in her. But three thinges ſhould preceed this life ſo ſinguler, this ſanctity and conuerſation with God, this perfect charity towardes God and our neighbour, this ſeeling of the diuine familiarity; Firſt, a perfect mortification in worckes and affaires of the world, in ſuch ſort that the ſoule for her owne reſpect haue no contentment in any creature what ſoeuer, and leſſe in her ſelfe, but onlie in her Creatour; The ſecond, that ſhe be diſtracted from all ſpirituall conſolations, wherin ſhe taketh comfort and reioyceth for her owne repoſe and taſt: becauſe often times in the ſpirittes euen of them that vtteirle ſhunne ſpirituall thinges, doe grow great affections and ſpirituall delectations, wherin they finde conſolations

for themſelues, but God ſeldome, or neuer: and ſo they ſhutt the gate to the true light, and this happeneth becauſe they propoſe not God for the end of their exerciſes purelie and without meane of any creature. Now this ſincere intention and renunciation, as it is far more perfect, ſo is it much more difficult then the former: therfore alſo the ſoule that doubteth therof holdeth her ſelfe abſolutely in the hand of God, as well for matters of the world as of the body &amp; ſoule. The third is, that with an aſsiduous dilligēce ſhe procureth to conuert her ſelfe free and peaceable into this moſt pure and moſt ſimple good, which is God, remitting her ſpiritt into him not in part, but abſolutely conſidering God, &amp; enioying him as it pleaſeth him to communicate himſelfe vnto her in this life, for the excellēcie &amp; diuine prerogatiues, by which we call him with diuers names, Almighty God, moſt wiſe, moſt good, moſt iuſt. For ſo much as the holy ſcripture attributeth vnto him theſe names and qualities, for the diuers effects which he worcketh in his creatures; wherby we come to the knowledge of him, for the diuine eſſence exceedeth all titles, all tearmes and imaginations of our vnderſtāding: and when the ſoule cometh to contemplate God in the ſaid māner, ſhe attayneth the quiet and peaceable eſtate of contēplation, though it be not cōtinuall but for a very ſhort time in regard of the infirmity and weight of the mortallity wherin ſhe liueth. The property of this eſtate is, that the ſoule be inſtructed &amp; addreſſed towardes God, in all her actions &amp; cogitations, remote from the way of humane prudē
                     ce, conſidering that God is the guide and maſter of euery eſtate of ſpirituall perfection, and that he alone knoweth the neceſsities, the capacity, &amp; the intētions of the ſpirit of man, and therfore he alone can conduct &amp; guide vs in the moſt commodious and moſt certaine way. They therefore doe erre who by their counſaile and doctrine will, not only perſiſt in their own opinions, but alſo admoniſh others: for taking on them to be guides of the blinde, they doe not perceaue that thēſelues being blind &amp; preſuming to know the neceſsity of the feeble, both the one and the other doe oftē fall into the deepe gulfe of errour. It is alſo the property of this degree of perfectiō, that the man which hath attained the ſame is conuerſant in all the exerciſes of the other foreſaid degrees, &amp; eſpeciallie of humility, of the imitation &amp; memory of I. C. wherin he layeth a deep foundation, that the edifice of his contemplation fall not: but be conſerued and augmented by the benignity of IESVS CHRIST.
                  Among other effectes wherby the holy Ghoſt diſcouered to haue cō
                     municated this height of perfectiō vnto his ſeruāt Fr. one was the manifeſt and almoſt continuall ſpiritt of prophecie, wherwith he endued him wherby he ſeemed peaceablyto enjoy the contēplatiō of God &amp; a diuine conference and familiarity. And by how much he was ſequeſtred &amp; diſioyned

from all the world and from himſelfe, ſo much was he perfectly and intentiuely alwayes employed in the exerciſes of the ſpiritt. By reaſon alſo of them, his life and perfection is praiſed and preached, conſidering that therby he is admitted to the tranquilitie of the diuine contemplation.
               
               
                  Of the ſeauenth degree of perſection.
                  THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                  THere is no man that with humane wordes can ſay any thing of the ſeauenth degree of perfection: which is a priuiledge rarely communicated of God, ſith that the wordes of Angels would be defectiue and ſeeme barbarous in the explication therof. Some SS. haue experienced it in this fleſh, God communicating it vnto thē ſodenly as to paſſengers, &amp; now they enioy and poſſeſſe it manifeſtly without limitation or meaſure of faith. It is that, which the iuſt doe feele in glory, being of the nomber of thoſe thinges which the eyes cannot behold, nor the eares heare, norEſay. 64. &amp; 1.

Bernard ſaith, it is not permitted to all, or in one ſame place and degree to enioy the ſecrett and glorious preſence of God, but according as the celeſtiall Father determineth to each one, becauſe we haue not elected God, but he vs, who hath giuen place proper to each one of his SS. &amp; each one is where he hath bin placed. S. Mary Magdalē found place &amp; to her was graunted the feet of our Lord I. C. S. Thomas the Apoſtle was admitted to his ſide, S. Peter to the boſome of the Father: S. Iohn to the breaſt of I. C. S. Paul was eleuated to the third heauē: the ſacred woūdes of our Lord I. C. were cōmunicated vnto S. Francis. Who thē ſhall preſume to haue a deſire to know the perfectiō &amp; merittes of ſuch a greatnes, as S. Mary Magdalē repoſed on the bed of true penance, S. Thomas in the light of truth, S. Peter in the chaire of faith. S. Iohn in the fournace of charity. S. Paul in the throne of wiſdome, and S. Francis in the loue &amp; trāsformation of I.

                  How S. Francis ſent certaine Religious to preach the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, vnto the Mores in Spaine.
                  THE FIRST CHAPTER.
                  
                     IN the yeare of grace 1219. the glorious Father S. Francis kept the great generall chapter att Pentecoſt, wherat all the Religious of his Order aſſembled, as it hath bin amplie declared in the firſt booke of the firſt volume of theſe preſent Chronicles. This Chapter was held eleuen years after that Pope Innocent the third had with his owne mouth confirmed the Order of the Frere Minors, &amp; the fourth yeare of the Popedome of Pope Honorious the third of bleſſed memory, who then piously gouerned the Church. In this Chapter, it was reuealed vnto S. Francis, that he ſhould againe ſend his Religious ouer the world, to preach the faith of IESVS CHRIST, as well amongeſt Chriſtians as Pagans, After this, the moſt capable Religious of the Order

were choſen for Prouincials, S. Francis applyed himſelfe to obey the holy will of God. And becauſe the rage of the Mores was ſpred ouer three partes of the world, Aſia, Africa, and Europe; he reſolued to ſend his Religious into thoſe partes to preach the truth of the faith of IESVS CHRIST, to reduce the Pagans from their damnable errours: And to make a beginning, he choſe Aſia for himſelfe, whither he went with eleuen of his Brethren, and preached to the Soldan and the Mores of his kingdome. He ſent Brother Giles into Africa with Religious of like feruour and deuotion; who thincking to preach to the Mores; were apprehended by Chriſtians and very vnwillingly brought back into Italy. He ſent ſix Italian Religious of very perfect life, into Spaine, where the Emperour Miramolin of Marocco perſecuted the Chriſtians. The ſaid Religious were, Brother Vital, Brother Berard, Brother Peter, Brother Adiutus, Brother Accurſus, and Brother Otto: of whome, the firſt, Brother Vital, was by the holy Father conſtituted their ſuperiour, Brother Berard was an excellent preacher in the Arabian tongue; Brother Otto, was a Preiſt, Brother Adiutus and Brother Accurſus were lay Brethren, (the rule ſo tearming the Religious that keep not the quiet.) Now ſainct Francis hauing called them, ſaid: My children, God hath commanded me to ſend you to preach the holy faith vnto the Mores and to impugne the ſect of Mahomet: and therfore my freindes, hold your ſelues ready to execute his holy will in ſuch ſort as you ſhall ſee cauſe. Goe yee I ſay, my beloued ioyfully preparing your ſoules to the crowne which it ſhall pleaſe his diuine Maieſty to beſtow vpon you: performing his holy will according as you ſhall feele your ſelues inſpired. They as obedient children, only bended their heades, and croſſed their armes, expecting his holy benediction: but the holy Father firſt made them this exhortation: My deere children, I haue certaine wordes to deliuer you, that you may the better effect this commandement of God, to his glorie and the ſaluation of your ſoules. Be yee carefull to keepeExhortations to certaine of his Religious which he ſent to the Infidels. peace among your ſelues, and be not Brothers ſo much in habitt and profeſsion, as in ſpiritt and will. Next, haue ſpeciall care to fly enuie, which was the firſt cauſe of our damnation; ſupport with patience, and be ioyfull in perſecutions, and humble before God and men, and by this meane, you ſhall obtaine victorie againſt your ennemis viſible and inuiſible. Be yee mindefull to imitate with all your power, our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and to follow him in the ſtricteſt manner you can in all the three vowes: in obedience, obeying your ſuperiour, as he one earth obeyed his parentes: in pouerty, liuing therin as he did, for he would be borne, liue, and dye poore, and did alwayes preach pouerty to teach vs the ſame: and in chaſtity, liuing and perſiſting chaſt, not only in bodie, but euen in ſpirit:

ſith our Lord ſo muchloued this vertue, that he would be borne of a virgin, and preſently after his Natiuity, would haue for his firſt fruites, the holie Virgin Innocentes: and being on the Croſſe, he would dye betwene two virgins, his Bleſſed Mother, and S. Iohn the Euangeliſt. Caſt all your cogitations and hopes in God, and he will aſsiſt and conduct you. Carry with you the rule and the Breuiary, and ſay the diuine office the moſt deuoutly you can: Lett Brother Vital be your ſuperiour, and therfore obey him entierly; but aboue all, be mindefull to meditate cōtinually on the paſsion of our lord IESVS CHRIST: for that is it which ſhall make all incommodities ſweet vnto you, and all trauell pleaſing in this long iorney into Spaine which you are to attempt, and in the conuerſation and commerce which yee are to haue with the Mores, the ennemies of their Creatour. Beleeue, I pray you, that there is nothing doth ſeparate you from me, but the glorie of God, and the ſaluation of ſoules, for, but for that I would neuer diſioyne you from me. And God knoweth the greife and affliction which my hart feeleth for your departure, though in deed, your prompt obedience doth much comfort me, but it is neceſſarie that we preferre the will of our lord, before our owne.
                  Theſe good Religious began then out of loue to weep bitterlie, and affectionatelie recommended themſelues to his prayers, wherin next vnto God they repoſed more confidence then in any other thing, ſaying vnto him: Father ſend vs whither you ſhall pleaſe, we are ready to accompliſh what ſoeuer God by you ſhall command. But withall we beſeech you to remember, that we goe a mong moſt cruell men, whoſe tongue is vnknowne vnto vs, as alſo are their manners and behauiour: beſides we know them to be the ennemies of Chriſtians, deſiring nothing more then to drinck their bloud, and ours with ſo much more fury and paſsion, when they ſhall know we endeauour to conuert their people; for accompliſhmēt wherof, we acknowledge our forces to be moſt infirme and our ſelues very inſufficient, if the mercy of God doe not by your prayers aſsiſt vs: and therfore we recommending vs vnto them, demaund your holy benediction, that we may vndergoe this obedience to the honour of God and the ſaluation of our owne and the Infidels ſoules. S. Francis then lifting his eyes all bathedThe benediction which S. Francis gaue thē. with teares towardes heauen, bleſſed them in this manner: The benediction of God the Father, the loue of the Sonne our Redeemer IESVS, and the grace of the holy Ghoſt diſcend vpon you as it diſcended on the Apoſtles: conduct, comfort and fortifye you in afflictions, that you may valiantly reſiſt, couragiously aſſault, and gloriously ſubdue your ennemies, ſith God ſendeth you for his glory and ſeruice. And feare not, for God goeth with you to be your protector. So being full of teares he

diſmiſſed them: and theſe Apoſtolicall Religious tooke their iorney conformably to the Rule of the holy Ghoſpell, on foote, without mony,Luc. 10. ſcrip, or ſtaffe, bare-foote, with one only coate, poore courſe and all patched: but yet in exchaunge of all this, they had the grace of God, that ſafelie and ſecurely conducted them into Spaine.
               
               
                  How Brother Vitall fell ſicke in Spaine, and would that leauing him alone in the hoſpitall, his Companions should proceed on other iourney: and of his death.
                  THE II. CHAPTER.
                  THeſe good Religious being arriued in Arragon, Brother Vital their ſuperiour, fell ſicke and kept his bedde, the others expected there ſome time to ſee the iſſue of this ſicknes, which daily encreaſing, Brother Vital ſaid to his companions: My beloued Brethre, you ſee my ſicknes is violent, and what wilbe the iſſue therof, I know not: wherfore I will no longer detaine you from proceeding about that which hath bin enioyned vs: it hauing bin alwayes my deſire to accōpany you if it pleaſed God, who I ſuppoſe hath ordained that I proceed no farther, in reſpect that being too great a ſinner, I am not perhapps worthy of your cōpany, or to be employed in ſo worthy an office. It is therfore neceſſary, that you leaue me in this hoſpitall, and that you apply your ſelues to this holy enterpriſe of the conuerſion of this people to God, who hath thus farre conducted you by obedience: and be not greiued to leaue me here alone, for his diuine Maieſty will prouide for me: Proceede then on your iourney, accompliſh the will of God, and be mindefull of the admonitions of our holy Father, with a ſpeciall care not to tranſgreſſe them: and pray to God for me, conſtituting Brother Bernard the preacher to be their ſuperiour. The poore Religious hauing heard the ſaid propoſition, with extreme ſorowfull and ſobbing ſighes, that ſufficiently diſcouered the bitternes that afflicted their ſpirit, they bowed downe their heades, calling God to witneſſe of the greife they had to leaue him ſo alone: but becauſe their obediēce vnto S. Francis and him ſo required, they acknowledged themſelues ready to obey: and ſo hauing receaued his benediction, after they had louingly and charitably embraced each other, they departed, beſeeching him by his prayers to obtaine of God that they might againe ſee one an other att leaſt in Paradiſe. This poore Religious remayning then alone in affliction dayly weakened, till hauing vnderſtood the martyrdome of his companions, and giuen thanckes to God for it, he was ſo afflicted for not perticipating with them, and for hauing loſt that crowne, that burning

with charity towardes God, this fire in ſuch ſort augmented that by his good will and deſire, he ſhortly after receaued the 
                        •
                     ame crowne in his bedd, making of himſelfe a gratefull and pleaſing ſacrifice vnto his diuine Maieſty, and ſo haſtened to meet them in the other world. Thus much for Brother Vitall. We muſt now diſcourſe of the combat of his companions, who ſtill ma
                        •
                     ching further on, into Spaine, euen vnto Portugall, neuer ceaſſed in time and place conuenient to preach vnto both Catholiques, and heretiques, wherof then the nomber was great in Spaine, and euery where produced fruit moſt pleaſing to the almighty, whoſe grace had conioyned them together.
               
               
                  How the fiue Religious arriued att Conimbria, where they prophecied vnto the queene her death, and their owne Martyrdome.
                  THE VII. CHAPTER.
                  THe ſaid Religious being arriued at Conimbria a famous citty in regard that it was the vniuerſity of the kingdome of Portugall, as alſo being very anncient and right noble, there they found the queene Vraca wife of king Alphonſus the ſecōd, who incontinently inuited them vnto her, &amp; entertayned thē with great deuotiō, as exceedingly affected vnto their Order, and then very louingly demaūded of thē whence they came &amp; whither they intended, and withall offered to releiue thē in all their occurrēces. They breifely anſweared her &amp; diſcouered vnto her their deſigne: to witt, that they were ſent by their Generall Brother Francis, to preach the faith of IESVS CHRIST to Infidels. But the queene not cō
                     tent with this slight narratiō, putt thē into diſcourſe of diuers ſpirituall matters, as one more thirſty of the word of our lord then a hinde of freſh water. With whoſe diſcourſe finding her ſelfe exceedingly edifyed and cōforted, &amp; perceauing their extreme feruour, and to what degree of the fauour of God their merittes had rayſed thē; ſhe drew them a part, &amp; cō
                     iured them in his name for whoſe loue they had reſolued euen to endure death, ſo much to gratifie her, as by prayer to procure reuelation frō God of the time and hower of her death: not admitting their excuſes which were, that it would be a great temerity &amp; preſūption to ſeeke to know the ſecrettes which God for deepe &amp; great cōſiderations would not haue knowne vnto mē: adding withall that they were not worthy to obtaine the ſame, &amp; diuers other ſuch reaſons; but ſhe ſo importuned them, that they were att lenght cōſtraynd to accord vnto her: &amp; hauing to this end applyed thēſelues to prayer, they vnderſtood frō God that, and more then they demaūded, whervpō they went vnto the queene, and thus ſpake vnto her: Madame, lett it not, if you pleaſe, be troubleſome vnto you

to vnderſtād that which you haue ſo inſtātly required of vs: and ſo much the leſſe becauſe we aſſure you that no creature loueth you ſo much as God, who will in no ſort diſpoſe of you but for your good, and greater glory. Know then that you ſhall dye before your husbād and in ſhort time, and we ſhall ioyne with you neere about the time, wherof we will alſo giue you an infallible token. You ſhall vnderſtand, that within few dayes, we ſhall dye by the ſtroake of the ſword, for the faith of our gracious Redeemer, for which we infinitely thāck his diuine maieſty: exceedingly reioycing, that it hath pleaſed him to elect vs to be of the nomber of his Martyrs. But when we ſhall haue accōpliſhed our courſe, the Chriſtians of Marrocco ſhall bring our bodyes into this citty, to the meeting wherof, you and your husband ſhall come in great reuerence and ſolemnity. When then you ſhall ſee theſe thinges, hope and know that your terme ſhalbe expired, and that you ſhall ſhortly be through loue vnited with God, there to raigne eternally.
               
               
                  How the fiue Martyrs arriuing at Alenquer, the Infāta prouided thē shipping &amp; other neceſsaries, to goe to Siuill, and ſeculer habits, therby to paſſe vnknowne amōg the Mores, who otherwiſe would neuer haue permitted them to paſse.
                  THE IV. CHAPTER.
                  THe fiue Religious hauing taken leaue of the Queene, who gaue thē letters of fauour &amp; cōmendation vnto Alēquer whither they intē
                     ded their iorney, in which citty there was already a Couēt of Frere Minors whome they viſited, where for certaine dayes they comforted one an other, in meane while they alſo bethought thēſelues of cōmodious meanes to goe to Lisbone, diſtāt thēce about eight leagues; in which time they were aduertiſed of a merchants ſhip, wherin they vnderſtood they might paſſe, by the fauour of the Infanta Sanctia, the daughter of Sancho ſecond king of Portugall; who reſided in the ſame citty &amp; there kept her Court, they preſēted vnto her the leters of the foreſaid Queene, for whoſe ſake ſhe gaue them a gracious welcome, being one of the moſt pious &amp; vertuous ladyes that all Chriſtendome did then afford, and had reiected great matches, to conſerue her virginity, wherof ſhe made ſuch eſteeme, as ſhe deſired rather to be depriued of Paradiſe, thē to haue her chaſtity violated. She was in deed, endued with all vertues, and liued in great abſtinence and faſting, wearing next her fleſh a haire cloth in ſteed of a ſmock, praying day and night, giuing and diſtributing her reuenewes vnto the poore. She was a true mother vnto the poore, conſidering the affection wherwith ſhe releiued, comforted, and aſsiſted them. She then hauing heard related the

admirable worckes of S. Francis, and his Brethren, when they were there, the yeare 1217. ſhe called then vnto her, and built them a Couent without Alenquer, in a ſolitary place, againſt the riuer, by reaſon of whoſe ouerflowing, ſhe admitted them into her Pallace, where ſhe builded them a litle monaſterie, as a place more healthfull, free from the inundations of the water, and more commodious for her. The pious Infanta then hauing vnderſtood the holy and firme reſolution of theſe ſaid Religious, commended it exceedinglie, and for the time of their being there, entertained them very curteouslie, diſcourſing alwayes of ſpirituall matters. She gaue them ſeculer habittes, that they might trauell the more commodiouslie; for otherwiſe they might haue bin entercepted in their paſſage, neither would the merchants haue admitted thē into their veſſels together with them in their habittes, if they had in any ſort diſcouered their deſigne, for feare to offend the Mores, whoſe disfauour they would not haue encurred for any thing whatſoeuer, as people more reſpecting their profitt then their honour or ſaluation, and more hungry of mony, then of the glory of God. Therfore then did they remayne ſome time in that citty, in meane while their haire did grow and encreaſe, ſo that their crownes or other diſtinctions could not be diſcerned from ſeculer perſonnes: att length, commending their pious deſire prompt obedience, and feruour of charity towardes God and their neigbour, encouraging them alſo of her part, though needlesly, ſhe ſent them to Lisbone as worldlings and vnknowne, there to embarcke themſelues for Seuill, hauing withall formerly furniſhed them with what was neceſſarie.
               
               
                  How the ſaid Religious arriuing att Siuill, and hauing caſt off then ſeculer habitt, did preach to the Mores, and of the beginning of their tribulations.
                  THE V. CHAPTER.
                  THe good Religious, not without much trouble arriued att Seuill, where they disbarqued themſelues. This citty was then poſſeſſed and vſurped by the Mores, they lodged in the houſe of a Cittizen, that was a Chriſtian, rich, noble, and deuout, there they putt off their ſeculer habitts, tooke their owne, and then for eight dayes together applyed thēſelues to faſting and feruent prayer, with teares begging day and night of almighty God, that he would pleaſe to aſsiſt and further them, that they might begin their enterpriſe to the glory of his diuine maieſty, to their owne, and thoſe ruined ſoules ſaluation, and that he would giue them force to die for his holy faith. Now being deceaued

by the exteriour apparence of the deuotion of their Hoſt, they plainlie diſcouerd vnto him their full intention, preſuming of his aduiſe therin: but they were much deceaued and amazed, for he repenting that he had lodged them, for feare both of himſelfe and other Chriſtian marchantes that liued there, began to endeauour to diſſuade them, affirming that they would profitt nothing; but would rather put themſelues in extreme daunger and manifeſt perill to looſe their owne faith, by meanes of the terrible tormentes which would be inflicted on them. Which theſe good Religious vnderſtanding, they inſtantlie, without giuing any aunſweare or making him other reply, forſoke his houſe, and as couragious and valiant ſoldiers, went directly to giue the aſſault to the fortreſſe of the ennemy, to witt, to the Temple of the Mores, where finding all their ennemies in armes, praying to their Prophett, they began to chardge and ſtrike them with the cutting ſword of the word of God, preaching and prayſing the faith of IESVS. But the great multitude of ennemies ſeeing them in ſuch baſe and ſtraung kind of habitts, thruſt them out with the pointes of their daggers and ſtroakes of cudgels, vſing them as fooles. This beginning of trouble redoubled the pious feruour of the good Religious, making them actiue and deſirous to ſuffer much more for the name of IESVS CHRIST, wherfore they determined to ſeeke to enter into an other Temple greater thē the former, and full of people, there to conuince and cōfound the Mahometan errour, and to preach the truth of the Chriſtian faith: but they were not permitted to enter there, but were very rudely and with iniuries farre repulſed. They enflamed with great zeale, to denounce &amp; make knowne I. C. vnto theſe infidels, were nothing terrified, but to giue courage to themſelues, ſaid to each other: Brethren what doe we? lett vs remēber thoſe wordes of our Lord I. C. Feare not, litle flock, for it hathLuc. 12. pleaſed your Father to diſpoſe vnto you his kingdome: therfore lett vs not deſiſt to preach his holy faith. Wherfore doe we ſpēd time with this ſimple and inconſiderat multitude of people, conſidering the litle hope we haue being ſo few, to ſuppreſſe their obſtinacie? lett vs rather repaire to their king, endeauouring firſt to conquer the head, ſo with more eaſe &amp; facility to gett victory of the mēbers afterward? Lett vs giue him the on ſett couragiously and ioyfully: lett vs goe then, lett vs goe preach and tell him the verity, of the faith of IESVS CHRIST, of Baptiſme, &amp; of penance, in remiſsion of ſinnes. Lett vs boldly confeſſe before him that IESVS CHRIST the ſonne of God is true God and man, who would be borne &amp; dye for ſinners, with his owne bloud redeeming vs from eternal death, &amp; riſing againe after his death, aſcended vnto heauen, and ſitteth att the right hand of his Father, Iudge of the liuing &amp; dead, where he expecteth vs to croune vs with his holy martyrs for euer.
               
               
                  
                  How theſe fiue Religious preached before the king of the Mores, the faith of Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, and what ſueceeded therof.
                  THE VI. CHAPTER.
                  THeſe Religious being thus mutuallie animated, went directlie to the Pallace of the king, att the entrie wherof being intercepted by the guard, their Captaine who was a gentleman of note, demaunded of them what they were. They anſweared that they were Italiens, and deſired to ſpeake with his maieſtie, of matters of great importance, as well touching his owne particuler as his whole kingdome. Whervpon the Captaine demaunded if they had no letters or other token of commendations to deliuer him. They replyed that their embaſſage was to be deliuered by mouth, and could not be writtē but in hartes, &amp; by tongues. The Captaine willed thē ſecurely to commend the affaire vnto him, promiſing to deliuer it faithfully vnto the king: they prayed him againe for concluſion to conduct them only to the preſence of the king, where he might alſo vnderſtand what they had to ſay: The Captaine related the whole vnto the king, who commanded them to be brought before him; where being preſent, he demaunded them what they were; whence they came; who ſent thē vnto him: &amp; wherfore they were come. Wherto they anſweared, that they were Chriſtiās: that they came frō Rome, ſent frō the king of kinges, and Redeemer of the world, IESVS CHRIST, to preach vnto him his holy faith: ſo that their buſsines tēded only to the ſaluatiō of his ſoule: which ſhould be effected if he would no lōger beleeue the doctrine of Mahomet, but in IESVS C. the true God, receauing baptiſme in the name of the moſt ſacred Trinity, &amp; that he could not be ſaued by any other meane. The Mory king that expected no ſuch greeting, became deſpightfully furiours: for he eſteemed the ſeruantes of God to haue giuen him an extreme affrōt, to whome he ſaid: O ye poore braineles men, ſottiſh and miſerable as ye are; how can ye poſsibly preſume to vtter this ſpeech in my preſence, without more reſpect vnto my crowne, or feare of the loſſe of your liues, already infallibly incurred, by the great blaſphemie committed againſt my moſt holy Prophet; But tell me, are yee come hither expresly and in my only particuler reſpect, or to preach alſo vnto my people, and to delude them, diſſuading them frō mine obedience and their alleagiance? Hereto the good Religious with a bold and ſmiling countenāce anſweared: O king know that we are come to thee as to the chiefe of all this ſect of Mahomet, filled with diabolicall ſpiritt, and to him that in the bottome of hell ſhall

be more rigorously tormented then thy ſubiectes that ſhall perſiſt in obſtinacie, to the end that thou being reduced into the way of truth &amp; ſaluation, thou mayeſt be a meane of their conuerſion, as thou art now the cauſe of their damnatiō; for auoyding wherof thou muſt beleeue in IESVS CHRIST our Redeemer, who ſendeth vs vnto thee, ſaying in theMatt. 28. Goſpell: Goe and teach ye all nations, baptiſing them in the name of the Father &amp; of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt, &amp; adding afterward for thē that would not yeld thervnto: he that will not belieue, ſhalbe damned eternally. This king ſtopping his eares, began to rage and crye out: O curſed wretches, your former lewd behauiour no doubt hath brought you hither, where it ſhalbe rewarded inſtantly; neither is there any other meane to deliuer &amp; free your ſelues, but that you vnſay whatſoeuer you haue now fooliſhly and raſhlie vttered; and to receaue and eſpouſe the Religion of our great Prophett; for, ſo doeing, I will not only pardō you, but will alſo make you great and rich in my kingdome, that it may publikelie appeare how much we priſe and eſteeme the greatnes of our Prophett: and how much we honour, reſpect and enrich thoſe that preferre our Religion before their owne: but otherwiſe, you ſhall for your ſollie dye with infinite torments, or I will enforce you to beleeue me: The Religious replyed, if your law were not full of lies, falſe &amp; impious, as it is, but iuſt and conformable vnto truth, we would receaue it, but becauſe it doth eternallie damne the followers therof, we reſpect not all treaſure, nor feare tormentes; for falſe honours are the baites and deluſions of you Mores, who truely miſerable, doe end together with them, becauſe they haue no longer continuance, and you are eternallie damned: the meerlie contrarie happening to vs, conſidering that by the pouertie and contempt of our dayes of this life, we pourchace eternall treaſures and honours in heauen, as our Lord teacheth vs, when he ſaid: Heap notMatt. 6. vp your treaſure in earth, where nothing is ſecure: but in heauen, where you may for euer enioy the benefitt therof. And therfore O king, be thou conuerted to receaue this true and holie law, in regard of this recompence. And if thou ſo much eſteeme a kingdome of this world, how much more oughteſt thou to eſteeme this eternall kingdome of heauē? tourne thy hart to the ſoueraigne and true God, who hath thus long expected thy penannce, and now ſendeth vs vnto thee, as his meſſengers to deliuer thee from the eternall tormentes of hell, which are prepared for thee and all them that follow the abſolutely accurſed Mahomett. Take heed how thou miſpriſe the grace which God by meanes of vs doth offer vnto thee.
               
               
                  
                  How the fiue Martyrs were adiudged to death by the Morian king, who att the inſtance of the prince his ſonne, reuoked his ſentence.
                  THE VII. CHAPTER.
                  THe Morian king could no longer endure nor heare the preaching and remonſtrance of the Religious againſt his ſect; but being exceedingly afflicted and enraged, commanded them to be expelled his preſence, and condemned them to be cruelly whipt, and then to haue their heades cutt off. The Martyrs then haſtened to death, with a courage and countenance very ioyfull and contented, as they that knew themſelues neere to the accompliſhment of what they ſo much deſired, and to encourage each other, they mutually ſaid: Behold brethren, behold how God doth benignely offer vnto vs, that which we haue ſo long deſired of him. We are att the port, lett vs ſeeke to arme vs well to endure this litle conflict; henceforward we ſhal no more feare the terrible tempeſtes of this world, nor the windes of the temptations of the deuill, nor the deceiptfull ſinging of the alluring Mermaides of our fleſh, the impious thenceforward ſhall haue no more power ouer this our feeble body, for we goe into a glorious country, to ſee againe our firſt originall, and to ſerue our Lord, whoſe ſeruice is to reigne: there ſhal we receaue recompenſe of our labours, after more then a hundred, more then the double, yea a thouſand times more then we deſerue. Lett vs now then giue prayſe to our God; enduring this litle for his loue: lett vs reſtore this life to him that hath redeemed it by his owne death. Vttering theſe good ſpeeches, thy haſtened to receaue the martyrdome att the place where they were to be executed, goeing before the executioner, who with ſome other officers of Iuſtice, ſeeing with what alacrity they haſtened to their death, began to haue compaſsion on them as of poore fooliſh perſonnes, and therfore exhorted them to reflect on their owne caſe, with theſe or the like wordes; Doe yee not conſider your owne miſery, thus reioycing, being ſo neere the loſſe both of this life and the other? deny that which you haue vnaduiſedly and impiously, or att leaſt temerariously vttered againſt our law, and againſt the perſon of our king; and to this effect we will ſeeke to obtaine you fauour, and to enrich you with temporal ſubſtance, and our Prophett Mahomett, who is very mercifull, will pardon you, and benefitt you in the other life. The Religious herevnto anſweared: your richeſſe, delicacies, allurementes of this world, are as falſe and deceiptfull as your law and your promiſes: and therfore lett them be your portion that giue creditt to ſuch deluſions. For our parts, we beleeue nothing more certaiue and glorious, then to endure for

the truth and the name of IESVS CHRIST, ſith that only is the ſecure way to eternall life. Therfore doe we ſo ioyfully contemne the preſent life with all the wealth therof; conſidering with all that it is but a puffe in compariſon of eternity. And the falſe Prophett whome you honour being in hell, can neither obtaine mercy for himſelfe, nor for any others. There did accompany them certaine Chriſtians, who much feared, that the extremity of the tormentes might enforce them to renounce their Faith. The ſonne of the ſaid king of Seuill who was preſent with his Father when he gaue ſentence againſt the holy Religious, perceauing his fury to be ſomewhat appeaſed, ſaid vnto him: Vpon what reaſon, Father, haue you ſo lightlie giuen order for the death of theſe men? It were not amiſſe (vnder correction of your better aduiſe) that you commanded our Preiſtes to be called, that they may conuince the impious Chriſtians, as well by naturall reaſons, as by aucthority of the law: for mine opinon is, that proceeding otherwiſe, you putt them to death vniuſtly euen according to our owne lawes. The king weighing what his ſonne had ſaid, and a litle moderating himſelfe, commaunded that they ſhould not be executed, but ſhould be impriſoned in an high and ſtrong toure, till it were more maturely concluded what ſhould be done againſt them.
               
               
                  How the Martyrs preached thorough the batlements of the tour where they were priſonners, and therfore were shutt vp into a deep dungeon, then preſented to the king, and att last by aduiſe of the Counſaile, ſent to Maroccho.
                  THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe Martyrs by this reuocation, felt in their hartes a double martyrdome, fearing that God would withdraw from them his grace of ſuffering for him, by reaſon of ſome imperfection which he ſaw in them: neuertheles entierly yelding themſelues into his handes, they reſolued on their part to performe their due obedience of preaching, what ſoeuer iſſue it ſhould pleaſe his diuine Maieſtie to worck therof: and to this effect, they mounted to the toppe of the tower, and out att the batlements they preached vnto the Mores that paſſed by, with a loud voice crying vnto them: Poore blinded people, beleeue in the true God and Lord IESVS CHRIST, and abandon the ſuperſtition and impietie of your vnfortunate Mahomett: otherwiſe your law▪ and all you ſhalbe eternally damned. Now is the time of penance: God ſendeth vs

to viſitt you, receaue his word of ſufficiencie to ſaue your ſoules: forbeare to lend any more your ea

                     uill and to his illuſions, if you wil not be eternally tormented in hell. Such and like matters did theſe holy Martyrs preach: wherof the king was incontinentlie aduertiſed, who commaunded them to be thruſt downe into a deep dungeon, where they perſiſted in continuall prayer, the ſpace of fiue entire dayes preaching alſo to the other priſoners. After that, the king cauſed them to be brought before him, ſuppoſing they had binreclaymed and repentant: therfore diſirous to gaine them by menaces, terrours, promiſes and mercie, to allure them to his ſect, he ſaid: O yee ſottiſh and blinded, haue you not as yet acknowledged and abiured your errour? Doe no longer abuſe my clemencie, who haue ſo long expected your repentnace, as alſo my holy Prophett, who, though you haue blaſphemed him, is ſo gracious, as he will not faile to pray to God for you. Now I ordaine and att this preſent pronounce, as a finall ſentence, either death by the moſt cruell tormentes that without any delay can be inuented: or my grace with all the honours and richeſſe that my beſt fauourites enioy. The glorious Martyrs verie conſtantly anſweared him, as they had att other times affirmed, that they nothing reſpected honours and temporall richeſſe, and much leſſe thoſe tormentes, nor death it ſelfe; and therfore would yeld themſelues to be diſpoſed att his pleaſure, conſidering that their bodies and ſoules were ſo firmely grounded in the loue of their Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, that euery hower which they expected to meet him in Paradice, ſeemed to them a thouſand yeares, knowing that there they ſhould liue eternally, without feare euer to be ſeparated: then they added: Our God is the ſoueraine good, and not your Mahomett, for whome, as alſo for all his adherentes, are prepared eternall tormentes, which they already experience, as you ſhall ▪one day, if you be not conuerted, yea without hope euer to gett out of hell, where you ſhall call and crye, but none ſhall anſweare you. There ſhall you repent in vaine, that you followed not our Counſaile which God ſendeth you: there ſhall you be in horrour, greife, ſorrow and eternall diſpaire which God hath prepared for them, whome att the terrible day of iudgemēt, he ſhall find to haue bin contrary to the true faith of his Sonne IESVS CHRIST, true God, and true man, there to liue in perpetuall tormentes, as they who are his, ſhall liue in perpetuall ioy. Then O king, thou ſhalt not eſcape his handes, though thou ſeeme now to haue ſome power, which is a ſinguler benefitt beſtowed on thee by God, to ſee and expect if thou wilt be conuerted vnto him; and happy art thou if thou canſt acknowledge it. The king already experiencing the force of the holy Ghoſt that ſpake in his ſeruauntes, remayned vtterly perplexed: Neuertheles

retourning them to priſon, he commaunded that they ſhould be loaden with irons, and that bread ſhould be giuen them by the ounce, and water by meaſure. They remayned certaine dayes in this pittifull eſtate, in meane while neuertheles, he aduiſed with his Galociers and Counſailers of eſtate, what was conuenient to be done with them. Some of them gaue their opinion, that it was not expedient to doe them any hurt, becauſe, ſaid they, they are franctike and ſenceles, as may be iudged by their fooliſh and ſottiſh diſcourſes, ſo rashly and indiſcreetly vttered. Others anſweared the king, that it was not fitt for him to embrue his handes in ſuch baſe bloud, but better that he retourned them from whēce they came▪ to which purpoſe there was fit commodity of a ſhippe prepared for Marroccho, where there were many Chriſtians. The king admitted this Counſaile, and ſent them away in the ſaid ſhipping.
               
               
                  How the Martyrs arriued att Marroccho where they preached, and being thence expulſed they retourned againe.
                  THE IX. CHAPTER.
                  THe Religious being arriued att Marroccho, in company of a Spaniſh knight called Peter Ferdinando of Caſtro Caſtillan, who was then retired and dwelt in Africa, in the Court of Miramolin king of Maroccho, by reaſon of ſome diſagreement which he had in Caſtile: this man conducted them to the Pallace of the Prince of Portugall, Dom Pedro brother to king Alphonſus, that then reigned, who vpon certaine wronges and iniuryes receaued of the ſaid king his brother, was likewiſe retired vnto the ſaid king Miramolin: he entertained them with much contentment, fourniſhing them with all neceſſaries, being much amazed to ſee them in a habitt ſo courſe, ſcantie, and ſhort: their face ſo wanne, and their other partes ſo thinne, that their skinne ſeemed to be ſowed to their bones, their eyes hollowed, and their ſhoulders croked and bended by the weariſomnes of their painefull life, and mortification of their fleſh; and notwithſtauding there appeared in their countenance ſo gracious a vertue, and ſuch a feruour and ioy of ſpiritt, that they ſeemed in deed Angels of Paradice, exteriourly dead, but liuing and burning in ſuch ſort interiourly with the loue of God, that they eſteemed death but as a play, and ſought it as a pretious and wiſhfull thing, burning with charity towardes their neighbour, and moſt zealous of their ſaluation. Which the ſaid Prince hauing well cōſidered, as alſo the affliction which he vnderſtood they had endured att Seuill, to

pourchace the crowne of martyrdome, fearing that by attempting the like there, they might trouble the whole Realme, he laboured by many pregnant and probable reaſons to diſſuade &amp; diuert them frō their pious intention; but theſe glorious Religious, already martyres in will, perceauing the intention of the Prince, very early the next morning without ſaying any thing vnto him, went out, and ſetled themſelues where they ſaw moſt Sarrazins, to preach boldly vnto them the faith of IESVS CHRIST: and being afterward informed that their king was gone to viſitt the ſepulchres of the kinges neere the citty, and was incontinētly to retourne, and vnderſtanding which way he was to paſſe, they wēt out of the citty to meet him, where they made choiſe of a place ſomewhat high whither they aſcended to be better heard: Brother Berard, who had better knowledge of the Arabian tongue then the reſt, when he ſaw the king to approach, began with a loud voice to preach vnto him the Catholique faith, and what one muſt belieue to be ſaued, telling him that it was neceſſarie for him to abandon and adiure the ſect of Mahomett. The king exceedinglie admired to perceaue the confidence wherwith ſo poore a man did ſpeake: and with other of his followers endeauoured to putt him to ſilence, but failing therin, and therfore reputing them for fooles, he commaunded them to be retyred to the land of the Chriſtians. The ſaid Prince of Caſtile himſelfe ſent two of hisThe fiue Martyrs were 20. dayes without meat or drinck. people after them to accompany them euen to Cepte, and there to further their embarcking for Portugall, to preuent that they ſhould not be abuſed: but they conninglie eſcaped thoſe Conductors, and retourned to Maroccho where they preached in a publike place inducing the people to renounce the law of Mahomett. Which the king vnderſtanding, he cauſed them to be caſt into a deepe dungeon, and forbad to be giuen them either meat or drinck: in this manner did they continue twentie dayes: in which time they were releiued onlie with diuine grace: in the meane time there befell ſuch an intemperate heat of the ſunne beating vpon Maroccho, that it brought the people euen neere to death; the Mores therefore fearing that it was a diuine vengeance, made meanes to the king by a man of worth that loued the Chriſtians, and was in fauour with his maieſty, to releaſe out of priſon thoſe poore bare-foote Creatures, and to committ them to the Chriſtians, who ſhould haue chardge to baniſh them out of his kingdome. The king called the Religious before him: but he was exceedinglie amazed to ſee them, after a ſupernaturall and monſtrous faſt, ſo faire, ſo gracious, ſo freſh and well diſpoſed as they were; and therfore he demaunded of Brother Berard; who had giuen them to eat. Wherto he bouldly anſweared, that if he would become Chriſtian, he ſhould know the omnipotent power of God, and how he relieueth and nouriſheth his ſeruants in this life, whome

he conſerueth alwayes to recompence them eternallie in hauē. The king made no replie, but onlie cauſed them to be deliuered to the Chriſtians for the end aforeſaid, who ſhutt them into a houſe, and afterward ſent them in ſecure guard and companie (as they thought) to haue them embarqued at Cepte, vpon the firſt occaſion of ſhipping for Spaine: But they gaue the slippe to their keepers, and retourned to Maroccho as before; which the aforeſaid Prince hauing vnderſtood, he cauſed them to be apprehended, ſhutt vp and ſtrongly guarded in his owne pallace, for feare that by their meanes the Chriſtians of Maroccho and himſelfe alſo, might receaue ſome trouble and diſaſter.
               
               
                  Of a notable miracle wrought by the fiue Martyrs in the army of the kinge.
                  THE X. CHAPTER.
                  THe king Miramolin att that time was aduertiſed that the Arabians were entred into his kingdome, where they made hauock and deſtroyed the whole country: Vpon which occaſion he gathered his forces to encounter them: and by the helpe of the ſaid Prince, and of manie gallant Portugall gentlemen, which he had with him, he defeited the Arabians, whom he chaced far away, and ſo pourſuing them, they came into a valley where they could finde no water either for themſelues or their horſes: ſo that for three dayes they knew not what to doe, being neere death with thirſt. And becauſe the earth ſeemed to be ſomewhat moiſt, they licked it with their tongues: comming to the hight of a mountaine, they burned and became outragious with thirſt without any redreſſe, and yet greater was their diſpaire when they found the widenes of the Country to be of greater extent then that which they had paſſed in drineſſe: but conſidering that when they ſhould retourne, they ſhould all dye with thirſt before they ſhould finde water, they knew not way to take. Now the ſaid fiue Religious, hauing by the prouidence of God againe deceaued their keepers, came to the Camp which they found in deſpaire, where perceauing the cruell thirſt that afflicted the army, they publikely with a verie ſtrong confidence which they had in the diuine maieſty, offered to procure vnto the Mores as much water as they ſhould need, on condition they would be conuerted vnto the faith of IESVS CHRIST, aſſuring them that if they would be Baptiſed with the water of baptiſms, they ſhould not want water to drinck. This propoſition comming to the eares of the king; he ſaid this drineſſe befell them vpon no other occaſion, but for neglecting the puniſhment of the great blaſphemies of the ſaid Religious, againſt his great Prophett Mahomett. Theſe good Religious ſeeing the obdurate hartes of the king

and his people, to make knowne the omnipotencie of IESVS CHRIST, and the truth of the Catholike faith which they preached, reſoluing not to looſe the occaſion preſented to manifeſt the glory of God, for the ſaluation of the ſoules of thoſe people, applying themſelues to prayer, BrotherThe fiue Religious obtained of God water in an extreme neceſsity. Berard tooke a ſtaffe, and therwith made a litle hole in the earth, whence iſſued out water moſt abondantlie and ſufficiently to alay the thirſt, not only of the men but of all the horſes and camels of the army of Miramolin, yea they receaued therof and made prouiſion for the dayes following: which done, the ſaid fountaine incontinentlie dryed vp. This gaue ſo generall an applauſe, and the Chriſtians and very Mores were ſo edified therby, that they deſirouslie ſought to kiſſe their habittes, and to honour them as ſainctes of God, only the king perſiſted obdurate, as an other Pharao, and a Preiſt of the Mores, that a mong them was reputed for a S. who often diſputed with the ſaid Religious, and particulerly againſt Brother Berard, and becauſe he was ordinarily vanquiſhed, but eſpecially by reaſon of this ſaid miracle, he ful of greife and affliction fled, and was neuer after ſeene amongſt the Mores in that country. The prince ſent the ſaid Religious againe into his Pallace vnder ſtrict guard, for feare leaſt if they ſhould preach, they might more ſcandalize the king▪
                  
               
               
                  How the fiue Martyrs retourned againe twice to preach to the Mores, for which the king deliuered them ouer vnto Iustice.
                  THE XI. CHAPTER.
                  THey that had chardge of the ſaid Religious, being Chriſtians, did ſo reuerence them, that they could in no ſort enforce them nor carry too wachful an eye ouer them, by which meanes they eſcaped as formerly they had done. This being vpon a friday when the king according to his cuſtome was gone to viſitt the ſepulchers of his predeceſſours, they vſed meanes that he might heare their predication att his retourne, as once before they had done, which they enterpriſed: but the king ſo diſdayned it, that he cauſed them incontinentlie to be apprehended, and in extreme choler commanded a noble man of the Mores called Aboſaide, one of the principall of his Court, firſt to torture them, and then to putt them to death: but it ſucceeded otherwiſe, for this noble More was preſent att the miracle which theſe Religious SS. wrought in the army when they ſatisfied it with water, and ſo out of deuotion and compaſsion which he had of them, he was content not to medle with them from noone vntill night, notwithſtanding the expreſſe cōmaund giuen him by the king, whome he preſumed might be

appeaſed and pacified by the frequent and humble petitions which the Chriſtian noble men and gentlemen would preſent vnto him. But they perceauing how much the king was incenſed againſt them, for the iniury which he pretended thoſe Religious had ſo often reiterated vpon him, they all quietly retyred into their houſes, where they carefully kept themſelues cloſe, not daring to appeare, for feare leaſt they might freele the effectes of the choler of the king; wherof in deed there was apparent reaſon: for withall, the Mores were ſo enraged againſt the Chriſtians, that they had a will to maſſacre them all, in reuenge of the iniury done to their ſect and to their Prophett Mahomett. Att night the ſaid noble man conuented before him the Religious, who came to his lodgeing very ioyfull, all manicled and enchained. But were it vpon neceſſary and vrgent affaire that he had, or would he take occaſion to deferre their condemnation, he was not then att home; wherfore they were deliuered to an Apoſtata More of our Religion, that had renounced Chriſtianity, to be carefully guarded; and very early in the next morning, they brought them againe to the lodgeing of the ſaid noble man, whome neither then did they finde, for they vnderſtood that he was out of the citty and the king alſo, and would not vere ſpeedily retourne; they then committed the ſainctes to priſon vnder ſtrong guard, who, albeit they were enchained, beaten, and exceedinglie tormented, had neuertheles their ſpeech alwayes free, which they ſpared not to employ for the conuerſion vnto IESVS CHRIST, of thoſe that ſo ſtrictly kept and rudely entreated them, who in diſdaine therof, gaue them ſound buffettes ſpett in their faces, and abuſed them moſt outragiouslie. All this did not hinder theſe good Religious from preaching both to them and their other fellow priſoners, where they remayned certaine dayes in very extreme want of food and all other neceſsities: but afterward the Chriſtians prouided them whatſoeuer was needfull, in the moſt ſecrett manner they could; and att length dealt ſo effectually, and ſo gained thoſe that had chardge of them, that they condiſcended to permitt them to depart, on condition they ſhould be ſecurelie conducted euen into Spaine: for the ſaid Chriſtians feared and ſuſpected the hatred the king did carry them, by occaſion of theſe ſaid Religious, who deceauing their keepers as before, eſcaped from the place they lodged the firſt night out of Maroccho, and the next morning were ſeene againe att a publique place preaching conſtātlie the faith of IESVS C. aduertiſing the Mores, that if they did deſire to diſcardge themſelues from the ſottiſh deluſions of Mahomett, and free themſelues frō hell, they muſt neceſſarily be baptiſed. The Mores thē 
                     
                        •
                     ā furiously on the SS. did beat &amp; abuſe thē deſpitefully &amp; with tumult

and exclamation; but theſe true Religious endured this affront; like couragious and inuincible lions. Then after infinite iniuries and beatinges, theſe ſimple and innocent ſheep of IESVS CHRIST were led to the lodgeing of the gouernour, in moſt ignominious manner: for they moſt rudely threw them to the ground, trayned and trampled on them, as if they had bin brute beaſtes.
               
               
                  How the fiue Martyrs preached to the Gouernour of Maroccho.
                  THE XII. CHAPTER.
                  THe couragious Seruantes of IESVS CHRIST, being preſented before the parlemental ſeate of the Mores, with their handes manicled behinde their backes, all bloudy and embrued with the blowes giuen them by the people; the cheife preſident made them this demaund: Obſtinate men, and temerariours ennemies of our faith, whence are you? whence come ye? what is your deſigne? whence proceedeth ſuch a preſumption thus to blaſpheme our great Prophet? The SS. anſweared that they were by nation Italians, and came frō Portugal: but, ſaid the preſident, who permitted you to enter into this kingdome, ſo preſumptuously and boldly heere to preach a new doctrine cotrarie to the faith of the Mores? Brother Otto a Preiſt, conſtantly anſweared, that as for their preaching, it came from God, who is to be obeyed rather then men, becauſe, ſaid they, our Lord IESVS CHRIST is the Creatour, Redeemer, and ſoueraigne maſter, to whome whatſoeuer is in the world is ſubiect, and none is able to reſiſt his holie will, he hath left vs this commandement, that we ſhould vniuerſally preach his holy goſpell, therfore are we come to preach to your king and to your ſelues, to denounce vnto you the wordes of life, that being illuminated with diuine grace, you may diſcerne in what errour you are, to come afterward to the true way of ſaluation, as we ſhall demonſtrate vnto you, if you pleaſe to giue vs audience. Beſides we are ſent hither by our Generall, Brother Francis, who as well by himſelfe as by his Religious, trauelleth ouer all the world to preach vnto Inſidels (by an exceeding loue and deſire of the ſaluation of ſoules that induceth him) the true way of faith, notwithſtanding you carry vs ſo great an hatred. The preſident anſweared, you poore blinded &amp; ignorant wretches, deceaued as ye are, to eſteeme them for vtterly loſt that follow not your doctrine, but tell me a litle, what is that truth which you haue found, and whither it be poſsible that there may be an other way of ſaluation then what we profeſſe. Brother Otto repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt replyed: IESVS CHRIST is the

ſoueraine verity, and the true and only way that can conduct to the port of ſaluation, by meane of his holy faith: which conſiſteth in belieuing him to be God and man, God three and one, Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt: and true man borne of the Virgin Mary, Creatour of all this frame of the world, true man conioyned to the diuinity, and Redeemer of all the men in the world, that were already loſt and condemned by the ſinne of Adam, in which humanity he conuerſed with all, he inſtructed all, and ſaued all thoſe that would belieue in him both then, att this preſent, and euen till the day of the laſt iudgement, he ſuffered death and paſsion to pay by his precious bloud, our proper and particuler faultes, and incontinentlie after aroſe againe to conduct vs all alſo to heauen: whence he ſhall come hereafter to iudge on earth the liuing and dead: he ſhall then come in his maieſtie, where neither humane forces, nor richeſſe, nor kingdomes, nor Empires ſhall in any ſort preuaile; man being obliged to ſtand naked and alone, accompanyed only with his worckes, good or euill, according to which he ſhall iudge him, giuing to his SS. eternall glory in heauen; and to others that would not belieue in him, eternall fire in hell. The Preſident ſmiling ſaid: And how know you theſe thinges to be ſo certaine as you auouch them? Brother Otto anſweared: By the teſtimony of the holy ſcriptures dictated by the holie Ghoſt, which haue reuealed vnto vs this verity, by teſtimonie I ſay of the Patriarches and Proph
                        •
                     ttes of the old teſtament, as alſo by the doctrine and teſtimony of our Redeemer IESVS, who is the way, out of which there is none att all: the truth, out of which is nothing but deceipt: and the life, out of which is only death; likewiſe by the predication of his holy Apoſtles, confirmed by manie great miracles, which propheties for the moſt part are fulfilled, and only remaine thoſe that are for the end and conſummation of the world: in ſuch ſort as we ought alſo to belieue their doctrine, and with greater reaſon and foundation then you haue for your ſuperſtition, conſidering that you belieue only vpon the writing of your falſe prophett Mahomet which is not aſſured or confirmed by any teſtimony more then his ſimple deceiptfull and lying word: and we beſides the ſaid confirmations and accompliſhmentes of matters foretold by our Prophetes, haue infinite miracles wrought by our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, and his hol
                        •
                     e Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſours, and Virgins, that giue vs proofe of the holy, yea moſt holie and moſt aſſured faith; for we haue ſeene to be cured an infinite number of diſeaſed perſonnes, infinite poſſeſſed creatures deliuered, the neceſſarie vſe of members reſtored to the maymed, the blind illuminated hearing and ſpeech reſtored to infinite deafe and dumme, leapers cleanſed and purified, and finally the dead already putrified to be raiſed, which you cānot auouch of your falſe

Mahomett; therfore reiecting this vaine and abhominable beleife, embrace ours, approued by ſo many tokens and teſtimonies diuine and humane: flye this manyfeſt illuſion, take from before your eyes this falſe cloud, that obſcureth them, only by reaſon that you are borne in ſuch an accurſed law, and nusled therin; for beleeue that as ſoone as you ſhall begin to giue place in your hart to the holy Ghoſt, you ſhall interiourly feele ſuch a light and force, that you will after doe more of your ſelues, the we can by wordes expreſſe; and by your example you ſhall open then gate of ſaluation to the ſimple people. Take knowledge therfore with me, I beſeech you, how your miſerable prophett leadeth you together with himſelfe to eternall damnation, by meanes of many of his falſities and ſinnes, that he hath taught you, which are out of the true and only way of ſaluation. And if you deſire to ſaue your ſoules, you muſt neceſſarily follow the true light of life, which is ready to illuminate each one, and reſiſt no longer the holy Ghoſt that calleth you to his kingdome.
               
               
                  Of the constancy of the fiue Martyrs in their tormentes, and how they were viſited in priſon by our Lord.
                  THE XIII. CHAPTER.
                  BVt the Preſident hearing this notable diſcourſe, and fearing the people might be conuerted by ſuch pregnant reaſons, filled with a zeale towards his owne law, propoſed vnto the holy Martyrs one of theſe two elections, either that they ſhould yeld honour and glory to his Prophett, for the blaſphemies they had vttered againſt him, and ſhould freely preach his law: or els ſhould prepare themſelues to endure ſuch cruell tormentes, as ſhould enforce their death. Wherto Brother Otho, repleniſhed with exceeding ioy for the deſired aduertiſement they heard of Martyrdome, anſweared: if feare of death would terrify vs, we ſhould perhappes aduiſe to admitt your law, as many miſerable wretches, that for feare to looſe this trā
                     ſitory life looſe the eternall. But our Redeemer hath ſtrengthened andMatt. 10. fortified vs againſt that puſillanimity, when he willed vs, not to feare thoſe that haue power only to torment this wretched, vile and fraile body, but him that can torment both our body and ſoule eternallyLuc. 21. &amp; 2. Tim. 2. in hell: Therfore, for as much alſo as we know that he only ſhalbe crowned, who ſhall conſtantly perſeuer to the end, doe what you will: for we hope in the diuine Maieſty, that your executioners ſhalbe rather be weary of tormenting vs, then we of ioyfully enduring for the loue of God: conſidering withall that we repute this

death receaued for IESVS CHRIST, as the gate of life, wherby we are to enter. This iudge ſeeing their conſtancy cōmanded them to be ſeparated and committed to ſeuerall places, and cruelly whipt, and that after the executioners were wearied, there ſhould ſalt be put and vinegar powred in to their woundes, and laſtly ſhutt vp in priſon, all which was done: and the next morning he cauſed the ſame to be iterated, and then he ſent thē to a publicke place vnto the people, that they might be reuē
                     ged on them for the iniuryes committed againſt Mahomett. They were brought thither naked, their handes bound behinde their backes, and cordes about their neckes: there, were their woundes renewed and their paſſed afflictions redoubled: for beſides that they were cruelly beaten &amp; ſcourged, they caſt them vpon broaken glaſſe and ſharp pointed flintes:Cruelties of the Mahometans vpon the 5. Martyrs. wheron they roled and tumbled thē: afterward they caſt boylling oyle on their bodyes, omitting nothing that might exulcerate their woundes: each of them eſteeming it a great ſacrifice vnto Mahomett, to exerciſe moſt barbarous and beaſtly kindes of tortures, or to inuent them for diſchardge of their fury againſt the holy Martyrs, who notwithſtanding, in the middeſt of the ſaid afflictions did with a loud voice praiſe and cofeſſe our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, demonſtrating that they reſpected not the tormētes which they endured nor the iniuryes diſgorged againſt thē: for one cānot imagine that beaſtly, diſhoneſt and infamous wordes which were not then vttered vnto them; but the moſt inſupportable vnto them, were the blaſphemies which they vſed againſt God. The whole day and part of the night, was ſpent in this pittifull ſpectacle, thē were they retourned to priſō, wher with all their hartes they gaue thāckes vnto God, and encouraged each other. Now the immenſiue and infinite bounty beholding from heauen his holy ſeruantes, voutſafed to giue them a farther conſolation with his viſible preſence, appearing vnto them in a moſt reſplendent light, wherin they found an ineſtimable ſweetnes and ſuch, as they vtterly forgott whatſoeuer they had ſuffered and endured. This light ſo ſpred it ſelfe, that it was alſo ſeene of the keepers, who therin ſeeing many ſhadoes of perſonnes were fearfull, &amp; ſuſpected the priſoners were eſcaped therwith. And therfore they haſtened to a priſoner that was a good Chriſtian called Peter Hermand, to whome they related that they had ſeene the holy Martyrs eſcape and aſcend vnto heauen in a bright and cleare light. He coniecturing, that this might be ſome notable viſion ſeene by them, did comfort them: &amp; bid them not to feare, affirming that he had heard them all the night to ſing &amp; praiſe God; which they being deſirours to proue, as ſeeming probable, they went and found them all in prayer very ioyfull and content in their priſon, as if they had not endured any affliction.
               
               
                  
                  How they were preſented before the king Miramolin, whome they putt to ſilence and confounded.
                  THE XIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe next morning, the king retourning from the fieldes, and vnderſtanding what had paſſed touching the Religious, hereſolued to ſee the end of their proceeding, and either to conuert them to the law of Mahomett, or els to haue a moſt cruell reuenge vpon them. Which the foreſaid Prince of Portugall Dom Pedro perceauing, repayred to the ſaid Preſident, and prayed him that after the ſaid Religious ſhould be dead, their bodyes might not be committed to the diſpoſition of the Mores, but of the Chriſtians: which he obtayned. The ſaid Martyrs were then brought before the king, their handes manicled behinde their backes, their face ſwollen, blew, buffeted, rent and all bloudy as was all the reſt of their body, with the blowes of the day precedent, ſeeming rather dead then liuing creatures: the king then beholding them with fauourable eye, ſaid: Well, you now being in my preſence, whither do you rather deſirer to be mine enemies and rebelles, and as ſuch cruelly to dye; or my freindes, and as ſuch aduanced to the principall degrees of my kingdome? The holy Martyrs anſweared, that he might well hold them for his good freindes, ſith they were come from ſo farre a contry only for his cauſe, and for the loue of him and of his kingdome, to ſaue them from periſhing and goeing to hell eternally damned, putting their liues in hazard for the ſaluation of their ſoules and bodies. The king, vpon theſe wordes, conſidering the reſolution and inuincible fortitude of the holy Martyrs, was vtterly confounded in himſelfe: wherfore as extremely enraged he retired into his cloſet
                        •
                      to conſult what to doe with them, ſith he could draw them to nothing either by ſweetnes or extremity: the holy Martyrs on the contrary praiſing God for that he had giuen them grace euer till then to preach his holy faith, notwithſtanding the buffets they 
                        •
                     ad receaued to putt them to ſilence.
               
               
                  Of a conference betweene the ſaid Religious, and a noble man of the Mores.
                  THE XV. CHAPTER.
                  THere was a warlike noble More, deſirous to attempt if he could by faire meanes and ſpeeches gaine them: but he no more preuailed then the others: for he endeauoured by ſweet wordes

to perſuade them to obey the kinge, who was more carefull of their good then them ſelues, conſidering that being in his power to torment them and prolong their tortutures in deferring their death, he neuertheles endeauoured to make them ſee their errours, notwithſtanding the iniuryes he had receaued of them, and their great blaſphemies vttered againſt his great prophett Mahomett; who all men know how gratefull he is to God, ſith with his owne mouth he hath dictated vnto him his holy law, wherin if they would liue, he would in behalfe of the king promiſe them they ſhould be moſt aduanced in his kingdome, and ſhould euer rule and gouerne in this world, expecting, by the interceſsion of their great Prophett Mahomett, a double croune of God after their death. Whereto Brother Otho with a zealous feruour anſweared: Vade retro Sathana, auant from my preſence thou hideous and infernall deuill: for we, with a firme and liuely faith adore, and plainly confeſſe, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, God in Trinity and vnity: but thou miſerable wretch, that art already condemned to the eternall fire, where he is whome thou adoreſt, hauing compaſsion of thy ſelfe, and performing thy duety, oughteſt to be conuerted, it were more neceſſary for thee to ſhew they ſelfe more reſpectiue of thy owne ſaluation then of ours: we hauing made choice of this aſſured way the more readily to attaine the eternall kingdome. And hauing ſpoken this, touched with a iuſt and zealous diſdaine, ſpett twice vpon the ground in token that he abhorred the Mores propoſition: which the More tooke ſo offenciuely, that in extreme fury, he would willingly haue drawen his ſword to haue slaine him, but that it was death to draw a weapon in the kinges houſe; and therfore he only gaue him a ſound buffett, ſaying: goe ſir maſter and learne to gouerne your tongue an other time. This good Religious then as a true diſciple of IESVS CHRIST, incontinently anſweared: Brother God pardon you: for you know not what you doe: then tuurning his face, he offered him the other cheeke, bidding him ſtrike as rudely as he would, being as ready to eudure both that and more for the faith of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST. The More not well hearing this reply, was exceedingly amazed when he was aduertiſed therof and tourning towardes his owne people, he ſaid: Theſe lewd Chriſtians ſhall not eſcape the iuſtice of our king, which this day ſhall ſharply be inflicted on them: But theſe miſerable wretches vnderſtood not that kinde of reuenge, knowne only to a few of the true ſeruantes of God.
               
               
                  
                  How the king attempted againe to ſtagger and corrupt the holy Martyrs▪ by promiſes.
                  THE XVI. CHAPTER.
                  THe king in the meane time reſolued to aſſault them with a new temptation, wherby preſuming to preuaile, he reaſoned with them in this manner: you would repute your ſelues truely and really happy, if you knew the grace which God and our great prophett offereth you, in that they ſo pacifie my courage as I cannot reuenge me on you in ſuch ſort as your offences and demerites require; but on the contrary, in ſteed of puniſhing you, I ſeeke by all meanes to gratifie you. Herevpon the king freed his chamber of all the company but ſome few fauourites, and cauſed to enter fiue faire and yong gentlewomen richely attired, then ſaid to the fiue Martyrs: Note well what is in my clemencie: I know well, that your extreme pouerty and miſery, ſuch as your habittes doe demonſtrate, hath troubled your braine: but I hope by curteſie and my meree liberality to cure you, for I will eſpouſe you to theſe gentlewomen, with whome I will giue a rich dowrye, beſides the portion of their parentes, who are the greateſt Peeres of my kingdome, and whoſe ſubſtance you ſhall enherit, vpon this only condition, that you accept of our Religion, which ſo many kingdomes and great perſonnages doe embrace. The holy Martyrs ſtopped their eares againſt theſe deluding promiſes made by this ſubtill and creafty tyran, whome they freely anſweared: O accurſed of God, aſſure thy ſelfe theſe thy delightes will ſhortly conduct thee to the goulfe of hell, in the bottome wherof thy falſe meſſenger of God Mahomet attendeth thee: to the end that as thou obeyeſt him in his law, thou eternallie accompany him in tormentes: And becauſe thou art great in this world, thou ſhalt alſo be greatly tormented, and ſo much aboue others as thou haſt more pleaſure then they in this miſerable life. Ah wretched and miſerable! acknowledge the errour which thou ſo obſtinatlie maintayneſt. As for vs by the grace of God, we know well how to fly theſe falſe and tranſitorie pleaſures, hereafter to enioy thoſe that are reall and eternall in the glorie of God, which alſo we offer vnto thee in his behalfe with remiſsion of all thy ſinnes: for our mercifull Lord IESVS CHRIST, dyed as much for thee on the tree of the croſſe, as for vs. And if thou wilt not be ingratefull towardes his diuine maieſtie, acknowledge his graces and repent thee of this filthy life thou leadeſt, which hath bin taught, by thy falſe Prophett, to thee and thine, whome he leadeth as

beaſtes by the noſe of the ſences after theſe carnall pleaſures, inſteed and recompenſe wherof thou ſhalt eternallie burne in hell. The king by this anſweare perceaued well, that his fauourable wordes avayled no more then his promiſes. Wherfore as halfe enraged with fury for the iniuryes vttered againſt his Prophett and himſelfe: ſith, ſaid he, you will not conceaue your owne good, I will make you proue what it is to offend the deity of our great Prophett, and the maieſty of a croune, for my ſelfe will reuenge the ſame with my owne handes for him and me: which ſaid he prepared himſelfe to play the executioner.
               
               
                  How the holy Martyrs were beheaded by the very hand of the king Miramolm, and how they appeared to the Infanta Madam Sanctia.
                  THE XVII. CHAPTER.
                  BVt the beloued ſainctes of our Lord, neuer in all their life heard more welcome newes: And therfore exceedingly ioyfull and content, and repleniſhed with an admirable conſolation, as knowing themſelues to be neere their ſo deſired recompence, they with a great vehemence and feruour anſweared in this ſort: O king, our bodies only are in thy power, and therin conſiſteth the greateſt hurt thou canſt doe vs, which alſo redoundeth to our exceeding good with God: therefore diſpoſe of them att thy pleaſure, for our glory ſhalbe ſo much greater in heauen, where his diuine maieſty prepareth vs his crowne in regard that we dye for his holy faith, in zeale wherof we againe admoniſh thee, and in as much as the ſaluation of thy ſoule is precious vnto thee, doe pray thee to leaue thy errours, wherin the diuell hath drowned thee, and to embrace the faith of the liuing God and of his only ſonne IESVS CHRIST, who ſeeketh to ſaue thee: becauſe this fleſh which thou ſo much tendereſt, ſhall ſhortly be food for wormes, and thy miſerable ſoule, ſhall feele the cruell and eternall paines which the damned endure in hell. The king heard not the end of this diſcourſe: but commanded them to be conducted to a place before his palace, that there he might execute them himſelfe: and that thereby the zeale he had to the law of Mahomett might publikely appeare, after that he walked thither with his people, where taking his great hanger, he ſeparated them, then cryed out: I am now to reuenge the cauſe of our holy Prophett, and the deriſions of our law, with myne owne handes: which ſaid, full of diabolicall fury, he gaue to each of the Martyrs a blow on the middeſt of the head, which cleaued it euen almoſt to the chinne, then he pleaſed himſelfe in cutting their throtes glutting his

fury by the ſight of their bloud. So being deuoutlie on their knees, praying God to pardon their perſecutors, they by the handes of this great1220. executioner, yelded their ſoules vnto God, the yeare of grace 1220. and the fourth yeare of the Papacie of Pope Honorius the third, the ſixt of Ianuary, ſomewhat leſſe then ſeauen yeares before the death of the glorious Father S. Francis. Theſe were the firſt of his Order which he ſent vnto heauen. Att the ſame time, the fiue Martyrs appeared to the foreſaid Infanta in the citty of Alenquer, about eleuen of the clock in the forenoone, ſhe being very deuoutlie praying in her chamber. They had in their handes each of them a hanger in token of triumph, and ſpake to her in theſe wordes: God preſerue thee, O true ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST: for ſo much as thou haſt encouraged vs, and as it were ſent vs to this our glorious victory, it hath pleaſed the diuine maieſtie to haue vs appeare vnto thee in the ſame manner that we triumphed, to promiſe thee that in acknowledgement of what thou haſt done for vs, we ſhall henceforward be thy Aduocates in heauen. Which ſaid, they diſappeared, leauing the Infanta exceedinglie comforted and contented, yea more then euer encouraged in the ſeruice of her ſweet IESVS. In ſhort time after ſhe cauſed a Church to be builded in the place where the martyrs appeared vnto her, that thenceforward that houſe might ſerue only for the praiſe of God.
               
               
                  How the bodies of the fiue martyrs were diſmembred by the Mores, and how the Chriſtians recouered them and preſerued them from the fire, that could not annoy them, and of the miracle which God wrought when the Mores cutting them in pieces thought vtterly to diſsipat and annihilat them.
                  THE XVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe bodies and heades of the holy Martyrs remayned in prey to the people, who reioyced to ſee them all murdered, and tooke pleaſure to rent and traine them through the citty, omitting no kind of inhumanity that might be imagined, to be exerciſed on their poore bodies: they toſſed their heades from one to an other, as if they had bin balles or baloones: the Chriſtians in the meane time prayſed God, for the conſtancie which the martyrs had, &amp; with loud voice thancked him for the ſame: others endeauoured to preſerue or att leaſt with their eyes to follow their reliques: which the Mores perceauing, they began ſo rudely to driue them away by caſting ſtones, that it might be attributed to a miracle graunted in fauour of the ſainctes, that the Chriſtians could eſcape without detriment into their lodgeing, where

they were enforced to hide and keep themſelues cloſe and ſecrett, during three dayes which the fury of this enraged people continued, who of themſelues would needes make a new maſſacre of them. Theſe Inſidels more wearyed then glutted with tormenting the ſainctes bodies, caſt them among the filthy ordure of the towne-ſincke, whither the prince of Portugall aforeſaid ſent his Couſin Syr Martin Alphonſus Theglio, and the aforeſaid Cheualier Peter Ferdinando de Caſtro, Caſtillan, to fetch them away: but they yelded their ſoules vnto their Sauiour and Lord IESVS CHRIST, in this ſeruice ſo gratefull vnto him and to his ſainctes: for they were slaine by the Mores that kept the bodies; which not ſatisfying them, they gott permiſsion of the king, to burne them publikely altogether, and to this effect, they made a pile of wood, and thereon layd the bodies and heades: but the fire being applyed therto, could in no ſort offend them, but retired to one ſide without touching them: Which many Chriſtian Priſoners (that aduentured to be preſent) did teſtifie, and certaines Mores that were friendes to the Chriſtians, alſo recounted the ſame as matter of admiration to the ſaid Prince of Portugall. The ſame may euen to this day be iuſtified by a head that is extant att S. Croſſe of Conimbria, the haires wherof were neuer touched by the fire. But the rage of this barbarous nation not only was not qualified by this ſo euident miracle, but was rather encreaſed: Wherfore hewing theſe holy reliques into ſmall morcels, they thought to reduce thē to nothing, ſaying: Thus are the blaſphemers and ennemies of our holy law chaſticed. But the diuine vengeance, which by extremity recompenceth tolleration, ſodenlie ſent from heauen ſuch an vnexpected tempeſt and ſtorme of haile, accōpanied with very frequent lightninges &amp; thunderclappes, furious windes, and vehement rayne, that the vtter ruine of the citty ſeemed to be imminent, ſo that the feare &amp; terrour which they had giuen to the Chriſtians, retourned vpon themſelues, yea in ſuch ſort that being fled into their houſes, they ſcarce held thēſelues ſecure. Which gaue courage, leaſure, and commoditie to the Chriſtians, to gather vp the holy reliques by the light of the lampes of heauen, which they incontinentlie brought to the aforeſaid Prince, none of them daring to take or keep them to themſelues. And by reaſon that the ſaid extremity of the ſtorme did not permitt them to finde all the pieces of the holy bodyes, they, partly by freindſhip, and partly for mony, gott them of the Mores.
               
               
                  
                  How the ſaid holy reliques were preſerued, and of their miracles.
                  THE XIX. CHAPTER.
                  
                     Punishment of one that would touch the ſaid reliques being in mortall ſinne. THe Prince of Portugall hauing receaued the holie reliques, preſently prepared ſhrines or reliquaries of very great price, to place and preſerue them in: But firſt he commited them to Iohn Rupert, Canon of Sainct Croſſe of Conimbria, att that time his Chaplen and Confeſſour, a very pious and Religious Preiſt, to whome he ſent three yong pages of his, who were very ſimple and virgins, that they might aſsiſt him to dry and accommodate the ſaid holy bodies, who in the meane while neuer ſtirred out of his houſe, ſo to preſerue themſelues from profaning the ſaid reliques in any ſort, euen in thought as neere as they could. Theſe youthes then dryed the ſacred reliques in a very retired and priuate place, byHow pure one ought to be to touch the ſaid reliques. commandement of the Prince, and ſeparated the fleſh from the bones, which they put in a precious cheſt, to be carryed iuto Portugall; then did it pleaſe our Lord to illuſtrate them by miracle; For a knight called Peter de la Roſe, not conſidering what danger it is for ſinners to touch the holy reliques of the ſeruantes of God, would preſume to preſent himſelfe, notwitſtanding he kept a wench whome he laſciuiously entertayned, but he had ſcarcely aſcended the middeſt of the ſtaires, but he fell and lamed himſelfe, without power to moue, till being contrite, repentant, and confeſſed vnto the ſaid Almoſner of the Prince, and recommended vnto the Sainctes proteſting to a abandon his vicious life, he obtayned mercy; for by litle and litle ariſing, he diſcended and went halfe cured vnto the Prince, failing only in his ſpeech which he had loſt: the Prince therfore with a great confidence commanded his Almoſner to putt one of the ſacred heades of the ſainctes on his breaſt, which done he was att the ſame inſtant perfectly cured. A ſquier of the Princes accuſtomed to handle certaine peices of the ſaid reliques, which were layed to dry on a buckler of his, without receauing any puniſhment, by reaſon that he was then free from ſinne: But falling one time, by inſtigation of the deuill, into a carnall ſinne, as he thought to handle them, the buckler wheron they were ſo rayſed it ſelfe, that he could not reach them: wherevpon reflecting on himſelfe, he went and confeſſed, then retourning to the ſaid reliques (which was admirable) he kneeled downe before them, and the buckler being diſcend to the ground and retourned to the ſunne as before, they yelded themſelues to be touched. This fact caſt ſuch a feare into the hartes

of the Chriſtians of the Princes Court, that thenceforward vpon this occaſion they were carefull not to offend God mortally. This hath bin teſtified by Steuen Perez, Marquarid de Santeren, who was one of the three Pages that had care to accommodate the holy reliques: he affirmed and ſwoare the aforefaid, to Dom. Matheiw, Biſhopp of Lisbone, confeſsing that he oftentimes abſtained from offending God, for feare to be diſcouered as were the others, by the ſaid reliques which he was neceſſarily to handle: Many of the Princes family, haue alſo affirmed thus much, as being preſent and eye-witneſſes therof.
               
               
                  How the Prince departed from Maroccho with the ſaid reliques, and therfore was pourſued by king Miramolin, and of three miracles wrought in the way.
                  THE XX. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy reliques being will dryed, the Prince cauſed the heades and fleſh to be dryed apart, and the bones to be ſeparatly putt in two ſhrines or reliquaries exceeding richly adorned with gould and ſiluer, and ſo placed in his oratory, where he made often ſupplication to the holy Martyrs, that they would obtaine him the fauour to eſcape the cruelty of the Mores, and without danger to paſſe into Spaine. For hauing determined himſelfe to carry the holy reliques into Portugall, and hauing to that purpoſe diuers times importuned the king Miramolin for permiſsion, he was ſo farre from obtayning leaue, that the king on the contrary was aduiſed to putt him, together with all the Chriſtians that were then reſident in Marroccho, cruelly to death: Neuertheles God did ſo mollifie his hart, that wheras he had manie times denyed the Prince himſelfe, he then of his owne motion, hauing ſent for him, told him that he would permitt him to depart againſt the aduiſe of his Councell, who held it requiſite for the good of his eſtate to putt him to death; but for his part he could not conſent to the death of a Prince, that not onlie had neuer offended him, but had freelie and willinglie done him ſeruice. The Prince therfore taking hold of this occaſion, and loading a mule with the ſaid reliques, he with all his familie tooke his iorney, ſuſpecting that the king would not long continue in this good minde, but would alter his opinion, as in deed he did. But the Prince in ſuch ſort putt himſelfe to trauell, that he doubled the ordinary dayes iorney, yea he made ſuch progreſſe, that he was forced

to ſpend one night in a deſert place, called Aroſſa, where haunted many lyons, ſo that ſuch as ſaw them take that way, reputed them as perſonnes deuoured that night. The Prince was not ignorant of all this, but repoſing his full confidence in God, by the merittes of the ſainctes whoſe reliques he had, he ſetled them in a place where the lyons were neceſſarily to paſſe in comming vnto him; for they were ſo neere as that their roaringes ſo full of fury were eaſily heard, but the holy reliques being layd on the ground, their fury was ſo reſtrayned, that flyingThe lyons reſpect the ſaid reliques. thence they were from that time neuer ſeene there. Now the king Miramolin, not hauing patience to endure the ſaid reliques to be caryed away to be honoured: incontinently ſent after the Prince, a great troupe of light horſemen. Which cauſed two great miracles; one was that the Prince inſpired of God, as the arcke of the teſtament was of it ſelfe conducted by the kine, that it migh reſt where it would, ſo did he putt the mule that carryed the reliques formoſt of the troupe, which tourning them out of the direct way, conducted them through places vnaccuſtomed to trauel, by meanes wherof the horſemen that pourſued thē
                     The reliques miraculouſly ſaued the Prince. could not finde them. But this was not all, for as theſe horſemen of the Mores, were well mounted, deſiring to pleaſe the king, and withall to ſatiat their fury, they thought it not ſufficient to make their ſcoutes about the ordinary wayes, but alſo croſſed the feildes, where they ſo couriously pryed after the Prince, that they found him; which chaunced for another reſpect but the more to manifeſt the glory of the SS. of God, and of God himſelfe in his ſainctes. For hauing ouertaken the Prince, and heard his people ſpeake, they were by the diuine puiſſance ſo blinded, that they could neuer ſee them; and ſo theſe Mores to their extreme amazement retourned vtterly confounded, and the Chriſtians proceeded on their iorney, thancking and prayſing God, till they arriued att Cepte; where the inhabitantes with great ſolemnity entertained them.
               
               
                  How the ſaid reliques were caryed to Conimbria, and of two miracles wrought in the way, preſeruing the Prince from shipwrack, and curing one that had bin lame for thirty yeares.
                  THE XII. CHAPTER.
                  AS ſoone as thy were arriued att Cepte, the Prince gaue order to finde out a veſſell readely prepared for Spaine, which done, it was incontinently fourniſht which althings neceſſary thervnto: they were no ſooner embracked, but they were aduertiſed that a troupe of armed men of the king of Marroccho, ſought them throughout

the Citty, wherevpon they weighed their ankers, hoiſed ſailes, cutt their maine-cable, and made a ſpeedy cut towardes the ſtraite of Gilbaltar, with a freſh winde that was very fauourable vnto them, for which they thancked God. But before they could attaine the heauen the night ſurpriſed them, with ſuch a darcknes, that they could not guide themſelues, in ſuch ſort that they were in extreme perill of ſhipwrack. But falling proſtrate on their knees before the ſaid reliques, to implore the fauour of God by the merittes of his ſainctes in this extremity, they were inſtantly illuminated with a cleare light which diſcouered vnto them their dangerous courſe, in way to daſh themſelues headlong againſt a rocke: for which eſcape they preſentlie gaue thankes to God. And ſo proceeding on their nauigation, they arriued att Andalouſia, att the port of Algezire, without any danger, thence afterward att Tariffe, then att Seuill; att that time the Mores poſſeſſed all thoſe places, ſo that the foreſaid king Miramolin, had giuen order to the king of Seuill that the prince arriuing in his kingdome, he ſhould apprehended him, ſend him priſoner vnto him, &amp; put to death all his company; wherof the Chriſtians of Seuill inſtantly aduertiſed the Prince, who wheras he intended to ſett a ſhoare att Seuill, ſailed on to Galicia, where he landed, and thence went by land to the kingdome of Leon, then poſſeſſed by Dom. Alphonſus his Couſin german; for he was fled from Portugall, vpon ſome diſſention betweene him and his brother, who was king. The Prince entring into the citty of Aſtorga, lodged with a freind of his that had bin thirty yeares ſicke of the palſy, whome he perſuaded to vowe and recommend himſelfe to the SS. whoſe reliques he carryed, recounting vnto him the maruells which by their miracles God had wrought. This poore man fell on his knees before them, and notable to ſpeake by worde, hauing alſo for long time loſt his ſpeech, he in hart and with a very ſtrong faith vowed and recommended himſelfe to God, by vertue of the ſaid reliques; And att the very inſtant in preſence of diuers, he lept ſound out of his bed, with a loud and cleare voice prayſing God. The Prince being by affaires hindred from preſent goeing to Conimbria, he ſent thither the ſaid reliques, conducted by a gentleman of note called Aſphonſus Perez, of Aragon, who attended them accompanyed by many knightes and gentlemen. The king Alphonſus and the queene Vraca his wife, being therof aduertiſed, ſent vnto them with Order to haue the ſaid reliques ſtayed in a place neere the citty, that they might preſent themſelues before them together with the Clergie, to giue them ſuch entertainement as they worthely deſerued.
               
               
                  
                  How the holy reliques were carryed to the citty of Conimbria in generall proceſsion, where the king was preſent, and how they miraculously choſe the place where they would reſt, and how they transported themſelues to diuers places, and of the conuerſion of S. Antony of Padua, which by example hereof came to paſse.
                  THE XXII. CHAPTER.
                  ALl thinges being fitly diſpoſed and accommodated, the king &amp; queene, attended with all the nobility, the Clergie and people, went a foote in proceſsion with great deuotion vnto the ſaid reliques, with many croſſes and banners, in token of the triumphant victory of the holy martyrs. Comming to the place where the reliques were, hauing deuoutly ſaluted them, they cauſed the mule that carryed them to goe before, that ſhe her ſelfe might chooſe her way, as ſhe had alwayes done before. So without the conduct of any perſonne, ſhe went directly to Conimbria, where ſhe entred into Sampſons ſtreet, att this day called the ſtreet of the old figtree, and then to the monaſtery of ſainct Croſſe, att which gate ſhe ſtayed till it was opened, though the intention of the king were to place the ſaid reliques in the great church. The gate of the ſaid monaſtery being opened, the mule of her ſelfe entred into the Church, and went directly before the high altare where ſhe kneeled downe, and ſo remayned, till ſhe was disburthened of the ſaid reliques, each one admiring the miracle wherby the holy martyrs did chooſe and make knowne, where they would haue their reliques to repoſe: for which they were all thanckfull vnto God, and there ended the Proceſsion. The king erected a ſumptuous chappell, att the place where the mule kneeled downe, and a rich ſhrine, wherin were putt the greateſt part of the ſaid reliques, others in an other ſhrine in the cloiſter of the ſaid monaſtery, the litle that remayned was ſent part to the Church of the holy Ghoſt of Goueau, where there was a Couent of Religious of ſainct Francis Order, and an entiere body to the monaſtery of ſainct Bernard of Loruant, three leagues from Conimbria, becauſſe the Abbeſſe of that monaſterie was ſiſter to the king▪ Now the very day that the reliques were brought into the monaſtery of S. Croſſe, they began there to ſhine by miracles: for they cured a great multitude of diſeaſed perſons there preſent, and from that time the miracles haue ſo continued euen to this day, that they deliuered from perill all ſuch as recommended themſelues vnto them, vpon which occaſion

it is, that ſo many ſtrange pilgrimes doe frequent that place. The greateſt gaine of that day wheron the reliques were receaued, was of S. Antony of Lisbone, called of Padua, who was then a Canon Reguler of S. Croſſe, and as ſuch, in the ſaid proceſsion, gaue praiſe to God among the reſt, and ſolemniſed the arriuall of the holy reliques: for he merited to be inſpired of the holy Ghoſt, who anymated him with a great zeale vnto his honour, in ſuch ſort as he reſolued to offer his life for the confeſsion of the holy faith by the example of the ſaid martyrs, whome deſiring entierly to imitate, he would begin by the habitt and rule of ſainct Francis, whoſe true diſciples theſe martyrs had bin.
               
               
                  Of the death of the queene Vraca, propheſied by the holy martyrs, as before in the third chapter hath bin recorded, and of a viſion which her confeſſor had therevpon.
                  THE XXIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe Queene Vrraca had great care of her death, becauſe the holy Martyrs had propheſied vnto her therof, yea ſhe was in extreme affliction, conſidering that their death and the translation of their bodyes was effected as they had foretold: but the iſſue of what ſhe doubted did ſucceed: for as ſoone as ſhe came to the holy reliques, ſhe began to feele her ſelfe ill, ſo that ſhe could not accompany them, but was conſtrained to goe to her bedde, and the night following ſhe dyed. That very night Peter Nuguez, Canon reguler of the monaſtery of ſainct Croſſe, a man of exceeding piety, and Confeſſor to the ſaid queene Vrraca, had this viſion: He ſaw a great multitude of Frere Minors, wherof fiue went before, but they were conducted by a Religious Father of their Order that gaue a very great ſplendour; and they entred in to the quier of the ſaid Church of S. Croſſe in proceſsion, where they very melodiously ſung matines: he extremely amazed att what he ſaw, began to diſcourſe with himſelfe, how ſo many Religious could enter, the dores being ſhutt as they were, and why they ſung matines, without any precedent ringing. Being in this vehement admiration, he queſtioned with one of the Religious, asking him who they were? how, and where they entred into the monaſtery att ſuch an hower? The Religious anſweared him: We are Frere Minors, and becauſe thou wert Confeſſour to the Queene, and feareſt God, it hath pleaſed his diuine goodnes, to reueale vnto thee this viſion. He whome thou ſeeſt to precede the reſt with ſuch glory, is our holy Father S. Francis, whome thou

haſt ſo much deſired to ſee in this life, and the fiue which thou ſeeſt to follow him, are the fiue Martyrs of Marroccho which are here ſhrined. Know beſides that the Queene Vrraca is this night departed, and becauſe ſhe exceedingly affected our Order, our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST hath ſent vs all hither, ſolemnely here, for the benefitt of her ſoule and for her obſequies, to ſing theſe Matines: doubt not of her death: for as ſoone as we are departed hence▪ one ſhall come to aduertiſe thee therof: And the Matines and prayſes of God being ended, this glorious proceſſion diſappeared, and therwith one knocked att his dore to aduertiſe him of the death of the queene.
               
               
                  How our Lord chaſticed the citty and king of Marroccho, for the cruell death of his holy Martyrs.
                  THE XXIIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe king of Marroccho remayned not vnpuniſhed, no more did his contry: for the very ſame yeare did his arme and right hand which he had ſo wicke dly ſtretched out againſt the holy Martyrs, wither, as alſo did all the right ſide of his body, from the head to the feet. The people were puniſhed in an other manner: for in three yeares after this Martyrdome, neither in the ſaid citty, nor in a great circuit therabout, did there fall one drop of raine, which cauſed an extreme dearth and mortality of catell; then correſpondently to the nomber of the Martyrs, the plague continued for fiue yeares after, wherof dyed the greateſt part of the men of that miſerable kingdome: but three yeares after the want of raine, the king, together with his Councell, acknowledged that God ſent that puniſhment vpon them in reuenge of his holy Martyrs, and therfore he ordayned a generall aſſembly of all his people, in the place where the Martyrs had bin tortured, and that inThe king Miramolin ſome what acknowledgeth his faults and ſatisfieth the holy martyrs. the ſame publicke place they ſhould crye towardes heauen, inuocating them, asking them pardon, and imploring their mercy: which they performed with ſuch confidence, that preſently there began miraculously to diſcend a gentle ſweet raine, by meane wherof the dearth and plague by litle and litle ceaſed. And then did the king permitt the Chriſtians in his kingdome to haue a biſhop, with condition that he ſhould be of the Order of S. Francis and might publikly preach our goſpell, and withall conſented to haue a Church builded in Marroccho, where the ſacramentes might be adminiſtred, conformably to our Catholique, and Romane Religion.
               
               
                  
                  How ſainct Francis hauing vnderstood of the Martyrdome of his children, with thanck fulnes to almighty God, gaue his benediction to the Monastery of Alenquer.
                  THE XXV. CHAPTER.
                  THe greateſt contentment that S. Francis had euer receaued of his Order, was to heare of the Martyrdome of his fiue religious: whervpon hauing prayſed and thancked God; he ſpake theſe wordes: Now may I confidently affirme that I haue fiue Frere Minors. Then bleſsing the Monaſtery of Alenquer, becauſe they hauing long time reſided there, departed thence to goe to their Martyrdome, he ſaid: Be thou bleſſed, O place of the moſt high, which haſt as it were engendred and produced to the king of heauen, fiue faire flowers of the colour of the roſe and of bloud, of a ſauour more then ſweete, which are fiue true Frere Minors, the firſt fruites of this Order. Would to God the Religious that ſhalbe reſident here, might for euer exactly keepe the rule of our Order.
               
               
                  Of a miracle wrought by the reliques of the holy Martyrs, against an Apostolike legat, that endeauoured to withdraw the people from their honour and veneration, becauſe they were not as yet canonized.
                  THE XXVI CHAPTER.
                  ATt this very time, as the reliques of the ſaid holy Martyrs were exceedingly honoured of the Spainardes, it fell out that a legatt of the holy Siege was preſent, who ſeeing what deuotiō the people had to the ſaid holy Martyrs, moued with an indiſcreet zeale, not conſidering the canonization which IESVS CHRIST had made in heauen of the Martyrs, that had bin publiquely martyred, nor the miracles that had followed therevpon, he began to cry to the people, rebuking them as ignorant, and forbad them any more to make their prayers to the ſaid reliques, and att the very inſtant he was aduertiſed that his Mule which waited for him before the Church was ſodenly fallen dead, and thincking to goe fee the manner therof, he was immediatlie ſurpriſed with ſo vehement an ague that it enforced him to acknoweledge his fault, and the pride which cauſed him ſo raſhlie to ſpeake againſt the holie Martyrs, whoſe reliques he went to viſitt, and falling on his knees among the people, acknowledgeing the puniſhment of God, he cryed out a loud.

O holy Martyrs! I confeſſe that you are canonized in heauen, and becauſe God will haue you honoured and reuerenced on earth, I repent and confeſſe the errour of my tongue, and begge pardon of you for t, and doe promiſe that I will henceforward, be the foremoſt and moſt carefull that ſhall viſitt your reliques, and in whatſoeuer place I ſhall be, I will celebrate your merittes. A ſtrange euent! theſe wordes vttered, he aroſe from the ground very ſound, and his mule, formerly ſuppoſed for dead, to the great aſtoniſhment and contentmet of each one, aroſe againe: and this made the reliques of the ſainctes more▪famous.
               
               
                  How by the interceſsion of the ſaid ſainctes, a gentleman was deliuered from death.
                  THE XXVII. CHAPTER.
                  A Poore gentleman of Conimbria was vnexpectedly aſſaulted by his ennemies, neere vnto the Monaſtery of ſainct Croſſe, ſo that he ran towardes it to ſaue himſelfe: but being two forcibly followed, he could not time enough gett in, but was enuironed by them, ſo that, he hauing no other remedy but the inuocation of God, by the merittes of the holy Martyrs, they gaue him as many ſtabbes and thruſtes as they would, without any defence of his, ſauing the couering with his cloake, in ſuch ſort as he lay for lead in the place. The people that came next that way, carryed him 
                        •
                     pped in his cloake as they found him, in to the ſaid Church there to 
                        •
                     ury him: but as ſoone as he was entred into the ſame, he ſtood vp on his feet very ſound, and confeſſed aloud that the holy Martyrs had till defended him: and therfore, together with the people he repaired o their chappell to giue them thanckes.
               
               
                  Of the institution of the proceſsion which is made euery yeare in the month of Ianuary, wherin the men goe all naked to viſitt the holy Martyrs of Conimbria, for hauing bin by their interceſſion cured of the plague
                  THE XXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  IN the Biſhoperick of Conimbria there is a towne called Fala, where there fell ſo cruell and contagious a plague, that it diſpeopled the whole towne, for the inhabitantes were all either dead 
                        •
                     r fled, ſauing one man, already infected with the diſeaſe, and halfe

dead, who ſeeing himſelfe alone and in ſuch extremity, hauing alwayes ben very deuout to the holy Martyrs, he had then with an exceeding ſtrong faith, his recourſe vnto them, and made them this vow; That if by their interceſsion he were cured of that diſeaſe, he would euery yeare on the ſixt of Ianuary being the day of their feaſt att Conimbria, goe viſitt their reliques a foot and all naked, as long as he ſhould liue, and would take order that after his death one of his family ſhould goe thitherin the ſame manner, and withall would endeauour to perſuade all the other families of the ſaid towne to doe the like. This vow being made, he was ſo effectually heard, that att the very inſtant he found himſelfe more ſound and ſtrong then euer; neither did there any one more dye out of that place, whereto he cauſed many from abroad to retourne, and ſo it was by litle and litle repeopled; afterward his fellow Cittizens accorded to his vow, yea this deuotion ſo encreaſed that the neighbour inhabitants, and many perſonnes of note, gentlemen and others accuſtomed from thence, as is continued to this preſent, in proceſsion, to viſitt the holy reliques on bare foot, with an exceeding deuotion in the moſt rigorous ſeaſon of winter. And how ſoeuer the ſeaſon proue the ſixt of Ianuary, being the day of their Martyrdome, though it raine, freeze, or ſnow neuer ſo much, they omitt not this pilgrimage. Now the order of this proceſsion is thus: On the ſaid day all the Confraternity aſſemble att the Couent of the Frere Minors, that is without the citty of Conimbria, on the other ſide of the bridge, and there about nine of the clock, they ſtripp themſelues naked, ſending their cloathes to the Monaſtery of S. Croſſe, leauing on their bodies only linnen breeches of very meane cloth to couer their naturall parts, and a capuce of cloth to hide their face, or a handkirchefe, and ſo they goe in proceſsion, through the middeſt of the cittye, to the ſaid church of S. Croſſe, where hauing offered their prayers very deuoutly together, they paſſe through the Cloiſter to enter into a great houſe adioyning, where they reattire themſelues, and then each one departeth att his pleaſure.

                     The hiſtory of ſeauen Martyrs att Cepte.
                  
               
               
                  
                  How ſeauen Frere Minors departed from Italy, to goe to preach the faith of Ieſus Chriſt vnto the Inſidels.
                  THE XXX. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Antony of Padua and others haue left in record, that ſeauen Frere Minors were ioyned together to goe into Tuſcane, a Prouince of Italy, whence they demanded leaue of Brother Helias, then viare generall of the Order, to goe into Spaine to preach to the Mores: he names of theſe Religious were: Brother Daniel, Br. Angelus Br. Sa
                     
                        •
                     uel, Br. Danulus, Br. Leo, Br. Nicolas and Br. Vgolin; they arriued att Arragon, hauing elected for their ſuperiour Br. Daniel Prouinciall of Ca
                     
                        •
                     bria, hauing found a veſſell ready prepared for that place, could neuer 
                        •
                     btaine permiſsion of the patron therof to carry more then three Religious with him, ſo that he was conſtrained to leaue three to come afer him. He being arriued att Cepte, with his three companions, did not beginne to preach to the Mores till the arriuall of his Brethren, which was on the laſt day of September, and in the meane time they preached to diuers ſtrange merchantes and other Chriſtians, that from all partes flocked thither. When they were all aſſembled, they began to diſcourſe and conferre together, what might be the redieſt meane for them to profitt in the ſaluation of the ſoules of the Mores, or to pourchace Martyrdome, reiecting farre all humane feare, and fortifying themſelues with a great feruour of ſpiritt, and an ineffable zeale of their neighbours good. And hauing till then remayned without the towne, with other Chriſtians that were not permitted to enter, they reſolued to ſteale in ſecretly, without the knowledge of any perſon, that they might not be hindered by the Chriſtians, who could haue ſtayed them, or aduertiſed the Mores, who would haue forbidden their entry.
               
               
                  How the ſeauen Martyrs preached the faith of Ieſus Chriſt to the Mores, by whome they were abuſed and impriſoned.
                  THE XXXI. CHAPTER.
                  BEing thus encouraged mutuallie by each other in our Lord IESVS CHRIST, they began one friday by deuout and feruent prayers to prepare themſelues, and on the ſaterday the ſix were confeſſed by their ſuperiour, who confeſſed to an other, then they communicated and receaued the ſacred body of our Redeemer, ſpending the reſt of the day in pious deuotions, And the ſonday morning,

repleniſhed with the grace of the holy Ghoſt they entred very early into the citty: where they began to preach freely and loudly vnto the Mores, admoniſhing them to abandon the falſe beleefe of Mahomet, and to embrace the true faith of our Redeemer IESVS. The Mores admiring the confidence wherwith they ſpake, began firſt gently to reprehend them, then rudely to iniury them; but ſeeing theſe good Religious did perſeuer in this pious predication, they did buffet and beat them outragiously; &amp; then hauing bound them, they brought them before the kinge, where they continued their preaching, freely confeſsing the true faith of IESVS CHRIST, and giuing him remonſtrance of the deceatefulnes &amp; treachery of the law of the accurſed Mahomet, which he muſt of neceſſity forſake, if he would ſaue his ſoule. The king beholding thē ſo poorly attired, and conſidering their feruour, iudged them to be fooles, as did all his Courtiers; But in regard they had preſumed to preach againſt his law, he impriſonned them, and caſt them into a dungeon, where they were loaden with heauy chaines of Iron Manicles, and fetters, which exceedinglie afflicted them, for they remayned there eight entier dayes, in which time they endured much, and in diuers manners.
               
               
                  Of a letter which the 7. Martyrs wrote to the Chriſtians of Cepte.
                  THE XXXII. CHAPTER.
                  NOw theſe holy Religious deſirous to ſhunne idlenes, wrote this letter vnder inſerted to the Chriſtians reſiding in the ſuburbes of Cepte, which they addreſſed to Brother Hugo, Preiſt and Curat of Geneuois, and to other Religious, one of the Order of Preachers, and the other a Frere Minor, who were newly arryued in Africa, to adminiſter the ſacramentes to the Chriſtians there, and to worck the ſaluation of their ſoules; the ſaid letter was thus: Bleſſed be God, the Father of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, Father of mercy, and God of all conſolations, who comforteth vs all in our afflictions, and appointed to our Father Abraham the Ramme he was to ſacrifice, and permitted him to trauell a pilgrime on earth, and reputed his faith for iuſtice, wherfore he merited the title of the friend of God: teaching vs therby to appeare and become fooles before the world, to pleaſe and proue wiſe in ſight of the diuine maieſty. And therfore ſaith he vnto vs: Goe preach the Ghoſpell vnto all Creatures, and tell them the ſeruant ought not to be greater then the maſter. And if you be perſecuted, that they haue perſecuted me likewiſe: with which wordes, we his leaſt and vnworthy ſeruantes being moued, haue left our contry, and are come

hither to preach for the glory of God, and the benefitt of our ſoules, to the edification of faithfull Chriſtians, and the confuſion of obſtinate Infidels, as the Apoſtle ſaith, we being vnto God a pleaſing odour, we are to ſome an odour of life, and to others an odour of death, which could not be vnderſtood, but that our Sauiour ſaid: If I had not come, and had not preached vnto them, they had not ſinned. We are entred into this citty of Cepte to preach his name, and his holie faith before the people and the king himſelfe, who reputing vs ſenceleſſe hath impriſoned vs; it hath ſeemed expedient vnto vs to aduertiſe you hereof. And albeit that by the grace of God we endure much here, we are neuertheles exceedinglie comforted in our Lord, in whoſe diuine Maieſtie we haue a ſtrong and aſſured confidence, that he will pleaſe to accept our life for a gratefull ſacrifice, and therfore to him be giuen glorie and honour for euer.
               
               
                  How the holy Martyrs were againe preſented to the king, before whome they conſtantly preached the ſaith.
                  THE XXXIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe ſonday following, which was the ſixt of October in the morning, the kinge cauſed the holy Religious to be taken out of priſon and preſented before him, then prayed them to deny what they had vttered againſt his Prophett Mahomet and his law. But they conſtantly anſweared that they could not ſay otherwiſe then they had done, ſith it was truth it ſelfe; on the contrary they exhorted himſelfe to abandon his extreme blindeſſe, that held him in the handes of the deuill in this life, and led him to eternall damnation in the other: inducing him to embrace the ſole true faith of IESVS CHRIST our Sauiour, who, out of pure loue, being God vouchſaſed to become man, and to dye on the tree of the Croſſe to deliuer him from eternall death, and aſcending into heauen, prepared for him an immortall life. But this Morian king and his people, ſhewing themſelues deafe to this diſcourſe, determined to ſeparate theſe Religious one from an other, and then to each in particular were offered, in the behalfe of the king, richeſſe and honours, att lenght they were threatened with moſt cruell tormentes, yea with death it ſelfe, if they would not accept of their law. Their threates auayled as much as their promiſes, for God had ſo tranſpearced their ſpiritt, with the ſweet nailes
                        
                           •
                        om. 8. of his loue, that they all in their hartes ſpake theſe wordes of S. Paule: Who ſhall euer ſeparate vs from the charity of IESVS? ſhall the ſword?

afflictions? worldly fauours and richeſſe? the pleaſures of the flesh, or any other allu rementes? and withall couragiously anſweared, and derided their threates, accuſing Mahomett, whome they tearmed accurſed, and his law contemptible, carnall, and damnable. A certaine Preuoſt then drew his ſword, and gaue their ſuperiour Father Daniel a daſh on the head: then ayming his ſword point att his face, and att his hart, he ſaid: conuert thee traytor, or I will procure thee a cruell death; which he did to terrifie the other ſix, who were by the Iudge and the Counſailers there preſent, perſuaded, not to miſpriſe the fauour of the king, and to haue compaſsion att leaſt of their miſerable liues: but they confidently anſweared them, and exhorted them, that being old, and already as it were in the mouth of death, ſo that they could not long enioy the contentmentes of this life, they would not perſiſt in obſtinacy, leaſt their ſoules were eternally condemned to hell, for adhering to men of this world, and to a law, that their owne conſciences knew to be falſe, as apparently as a thing to be touched with the finger. But theſe old men held themſelues ſo offended with this ſpeech, though they had bin very fauourable and reſpectiue vnto them, that they reſolued their death.
               
               
                  How the ſeauen Martyrs were condemned to death and beheaded.
                  THE XXXIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe iudge therevpon gaue Order that as enemies of the law of God, they ſhould be beheaded, wherwith the holy Martyrs exceeding well pleaſed, did encourage each other: and then the ſix Religious addreſsing themſelues to their ſuperiour Father Daniel, and kiſsing his handes, gaue him thanckes for procuring them theſe marriages: each of them asked his benediction, and the grace to be the firſt martyred for the loue of God. This good Father hauing his eyes beteared with ioy, thancking God for ſuch a ſinguler gifte, and giuing them his benediction he ſaid. My deerly beloued children, lett vs all reioyce in God, in this feſtiuall day which he hath pleaſed to ordaine for the laſt of our pilgrimage, and be not terrified: for all his Angels are preſent prepared to aſsiſt vs, they haue opened vs the gate of Paradice, whither if he pleaſe we ſhall this day arriue together, to receiue the crounes of martyrdome and to be eternally glorious. Theſe wordes ended, the executioners ſtripped the ſeauen martyrs, inuincible champions of IESVS, and hauing bound their handes behinde their backes, they conducted them out of the

kinges Pallace, with a trompettt before them as if they had bin attainted of ſome notorious crime. But theſe holy Religious as meeke lambes, went to the slaughter, and hauing their ſpiritt eleuated to the ſoueraigne God, ceaſſed not preach to the Mores by the way. Being come to the place of execution they fell on their knees, and recommending thē
                     ſelues to God, they ioyfully receaued martyredome, offering vp their innocent ſoules, veſted with the pious purple of their very bloud, with a great admiratiō to the Mores, who as enraged were not ſatisfied herewith, eſteeming themſelues (as indeed they had reaſon) rather vanquiſhed, then to haue ouercome. Theſe Miniſters of the deuill tooke thoſe holy bodies, diſmembred them, and trayned them thorough the dirt, till they were weary; and then the Chriſtians ſecretly gathered them vp and carryed them into the ſuburbes, where they were and are honoured and reuerēced for many miracles which by their merittes God wrought there; wherof hauing no other aſſeurance then the affirmation of the inhabitants of the place, I thought it not expedient to committ them to writing, as determining to inſert nothing in theſe chronicles but what is moſt true and autenticalll. It ſufficeth that Pope Leo the tenth, graunted and permitted the Freere Minors to celebrate their feaſt on the day of their Martyrdome, which was the tenth of October 1227. a yeare after the death of S. Francis. So is it att this day celebrated in the biſhopprick of Brague the Primacie of Spaine, though in the office of Bracare it is put in the yeare 1221. but it is an errour of the Printer. It is recorded in the end of the legende that a Prince of Portugall, by a ſpeciall fauour obtayned theſe reſiques, and carryed them into Spaine, but there is not to be found any other perticuler mention of certainty in the bookes of the Order.
                  
                     The 35. Chapter, is put after the 39. of this very booke, as more proper vnto it.
                     The triumph of two Martyrs of Valencia.
                  
               
               
                  How two Religious which S. Francis ſent to Valencia in Arragon, were Martyred there.
                  THE XXXVI. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Francis ſent two Religious of pious life to the kingdome of Arragon, to witt, Brother Iohn a Preiſt &amp; Peter a lay Brother, who arriuing att the citty of Teruel, they cauſed a chappell to be built there, wherin they dwelt, employing their time in pious exerciſes, and prayers, and liued vertuously, with exceeding

edification, and by their preachinges filled the citty with a moſt ſweet odour of their ſanctity. The citty of Valencia was then poſſeſſed by the Mores, mortall ennemies of the Chriſtians, and therein raigned their king Azot, a moſt cruell perſecutor of the faith of IESVS CHRIST, and therfore theſe two ſeruantes of God, reſolued to preach there, and to offer their liues for the ſaluation of ſoules, ſo paſsionate was their zeale of the faith and their deſire of Martyrdome. So then goeing and entring in to the Citty, they began to confeſſe and reſolutely denounce to that people the word of God, condemning their erronious ſect, as pernicious and damnable. Wherof the king hauing firſt made them all kinde of gracious offers to allure them to his law, them vſing terrible threates to feare them, and perceiuing that he no more auayled in the one ſort then the other, he cauſed their heades to be cutt off, on the feaſt of the decollation of S. Iohn Baptiſt, in the yeare 1231. and their bodyes were carefully gotten and buryed by the Chriſtians; God by their merittes working many miracles.
               
               
                  How the reliques of the ſaid holy Martyrs, were afterwardes translated to Teruel by the king of Arragon.
                  THE XXXVII. CHAPTER.
                  AFter this glorious Martyrdome, Dom Iames the firſt of that name king of Arragon, began by the prouidence of God, to warre againſt and alwayes to putt to the worſt, the king of Valencia, ſubdueing him att each time that they encountred, and taking priſoners a great number of the Mores, gaining daily and poſſeſsing his landes and dominions; it happened one time that he tooke priſoners certaine noble men of the Mores, whervpon the Chriſtians of Arragon prayed their king to demaund the reliques of the ſaid S. for ranſome of the ſaid priſonners, by reaſon that by their meanes God did ordinarily worckmany miracles, which cauſed the Chriſtiās to be very importunate to haue them. This requeſt was eaſy to obtaine; for the king of Arragon did exceedingly reuerence the ſaid reliques, and the king of the Mores was very deſirous to retire his principall champions, for a matter which he regarded nothing at all. Thus were theſe reliques ſolemnely placed att Teruell in a faire Couent of Frere Minors, there expresly erected in acknowledgement of the fauours and graces which in reſpect of them the Chriſtians haue receaued of God; and to this day great miracles are wrought there by them.
               
               
                  
                  How the Morian king Azot became Christian, and gaue the citty of Valencia to the king of Arragon, and in ſatifaction of his ſinne, he conuerted his Pallace into a Monastery of Religious of the Order of S. Francis.
                  THE XXXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe king Azot, perceauing his forces and kingdome daily in appearance to diminiſh in ſuch ſort as he could no longer reſiſt the king of Arragon, reſolued to enter into compoſition with him, and to render vnto him all the kingdome of Valencia peaceably, and withall to be baptiſed, reſeruing condition of honeſt maintenance during his life: which the king Iames promiſed not only to him, but euen to all his people that would be conuerted; and to others promiſing to permitt them: peaceably to liue in their law, or otherwiſe to retire whither they pleaſed. Which being thus accorded, the king of Arragon entred Valencia to take poſſeſsion therof, the yeare 1238. on the eue of S. Michael: this was the ſecond time that the Chriſtians recouered it: for Ruy Dias had once before taken it from the Mores, for the king of Caſtile, after whoſe death it was loſt againe. Now the king Azot became Chriſtian, hauing obtayned in gift of king Iames a rich Earledome, which his ſucceſſors doe yet enioy, all his moueables, and his pallace, which incontinently after, with the conſent of the king of Arragon, he gaue to the Frere Minors, there to build a Church in the honour of the holy Martyrs, in ſatisfaction of their bloud which he had ſhed; and conſequently there was builded a very beautifull Couent.
               
               
                  Of a Miracle wrought by the ſaid holy Martyrs att Teruell
                  THE XXXIX. CHAPTER.
                  CErtaine yeares after the ſaid Martyrdome, there repaired ouer the Citty of Teruell and the neighbour places, ſuch a quantity of locuſtes, that as a cloud they hindred the beames of the ſunne in the aire, and on the earth they couered all the plaines: the people made many proceſsions to be freed of this affliction, which yet ceaſſed not to trouble them. But there was a good man that conſailed the people, to carry in proceſsion the reliques of the holy Martyrs, which they did, &amp; went in great deuotion to an hermitage that was out of the Citty, and att the retourne of that proceſsiō, all the locuſtes were vaniſhed ſo that neuer after were ſeene more in thoſe quarters then in other places. This much augmēted the deuotiō of thoſe people towardes the holy martyrs.
                  
                     
                     The Martyrdome of fiue Frere Minors, with a multitude of Christians att Marroccho. This was the 29. chapter of this booke, transferred hither to giue place to the more famous.
                     ON an other time, diuers yeares after the foreſaid, fiue other Frere Minors were martyred att Maroccho, together with all the Chriſtians, men and women that then there reſided, in a chappell where they offered their prayers to God for the exaltation of the faith of IESVS CHRIST. This perſecution was executed on the ſixteenth of September, with ſuch rage and fury of the Mores, that there remayned not in the ſaid citty, ſo much as one liuing man that durſt profeſſe himſelfe a Chriſtiā: after this notorius Martyrdome or perſecution, the Mores ſaw a great ſplendour to diſcend from heauen, into the ſaid chappell where the martyerd bodies remayned; and heard alſo all the belles to ring of themſelues, and the voices of Angels to ſing with an ineſtimable ſweetnes; but their hartes were too obſtinatly hardened againſt God to benefitt themſelues by their conuerſion. The names of theſe Martyres are not knowne on earth: it ſufficeth that they are recorded in the booke of eternall life.
                  
                  
                     The Martyrdome of Br. Electus diſciple of S. Francis; and of his companions. Taken out of the 35. chapter, and placed here for the reaſon aboue propoſed.
                     
                        A Frere Minor died with his rule in his hand. THere reſteth no other memory recorded of the Martyrdome of Br. Electus, then this: The Mores tooke Br. Electus &amp; many others (for preaching the holy goſpell) to putt them to death. He being brought to the place of execution, tooke the rule of S. Francis in his hand, and ſaid to his companion: Brother I confeſſe my fault before God and you, of what ſoeuer I may haue offended and committed againſt this rule which ſaid, his head was cutt off, then his companions and conſequently the others: after that, many miracles were wrought. Touching his Iife it is recorded that he entred very yong into the Order, in ſo much that he could not performe the faſt therof, but forcing his nature he not only in this cōbat ouercame gluttony, but continually chaſticed his fleſh with a ſhirt of iron: happy child that began ſo yong to ſerue the almighty, and ſo gloriously ended the courſe of his holy life.

                  Of the birth of S. Antony, and his education by his Father: how he left the world, and became a Canon reguler in the Order of Sainct Auguſtin.
                  THE FIRST CHAPTER.
                  
                     THE glorious Father S. Antony was borne in the noble and populous citty of Lisbone, the Metropolitan of the kingdome of Portugall, in the weſterne partes of Spaine, his houſe was directly ouer againſt the great gate of the Epiſcopall Church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary: this Church is very famous among other reſpectes in regard of the body of the victorious Martyr S. Vincent that there repoſeth. The Father of the ſaid S. Antony was called Martin de Buglione, and his Mother Tereſa de Teuery, both of them illuſtrious in vertue and bloud, in which reſpect they were found worthie in the flower of their marriage to enioy this child. He was baptiſed in the ſaid Church, of which pariſh alſo he was; there was he firſt named Ferdinand, ſo that he was called Ferdinand, Martin Buglione, till he tooke the habitt of S. Francis. He began his firſt learning in the ſaid Cathedrall Church, with the Chriſtian doctrine &amp; the manner to prayſe God: he ſerued the quier both by night and day, offering the firſt fruites of his age to our Lord

IESVS CHRIST and to his moſt holy mother, whome he choſe for his particular Aduocatriſe, euen from his tender yeares. He cō
                     tinued in this pious courſe fifteene yeares, in which time he learned the ſtudy of humanity, afterwardes his bloud began to heat, and his ſenſuall appetites to deſire carnall and worldly pleaſures; As ſoone as he perceaued it, he endeauoured by the feare of God to reſtraine them: and becauſe it is very difficult to conuerſe among ſo many thornes and not to be pricked, he reſolued to take a ſecure remedy. Wherfore abandonning all conuerſations of this perillous world, he repaired to the Monaſtery of S. Vincent, without the citty, where were Canon Regulers of S. Auguſtin, leading a life of very exemplare piety, whence he neuer departed tlll he had taken the habitt, and made his profeſsion ſurmounting all the inconueniences and importunities of his kinred and friendes, that omitted no meanes to diuert him from it: there did he eſtabliſh his foundation in the ſeruice of God. But in regard that his worthie iudgement and great prudence began to appeare to his kinred and friendes, they repaired vnto him for his counſaile, and aduiſe in their affaires and difficulties, running vnto him as to an oracle, in ſuch ſort that being vnable to endure that exceeding diſturbance of ſpiritt, hauing with verie much difficulty obtayned the permiſsion of his Superiour, he retired to the deuout and Religious monaſtery of ſainct Croſſe of Conimbria, of the ſame Order, hauing ſpent two yeares in that of Lisbone. And he ſo profited and proceeded there, that it was to each one apparant that he was by a ſecrett and diuine vertue, not by a lightnes of ſpiritt, retired thither▪ For proceeding daily &amp; aſcending from perfection to perfection, he aymed at a moſt perfect end of his life: as being repleniſhed with the ſpiritt of wiſdome, by his continuall reading and meditation of the holy ſcripture, wherin hauing for his inſtructor the only and true maſter IESVS CHRIST, he made ſuch progreſſe, that his learning was ſufficient to ſhunne vices and embrace vertues, to refute errours and ſupport the truth.
               
               
                  How for the deſire of Martyrdome, he became Religious of the Order of S. Francis.
                  THE II. CHAPTER.
                  ABout that time thefame of the holy Father S. Francis did ſpred it ſelfe ouer all the world, as alſo of the Frere Minors his diſciples, of whome, as is ſaid, there were already monaſteries in portugall, they, by their pouerty and contempt of the

world conuerting many people to penance; the holy Father Saint Antony, as I haue formerlie ſaid, being one of the Religious of ſainct Croſſe, that receaued the holy reliques of the glorious martyres of Marrocho, and being as a noble Elephant, encouraged by the ſight of the bloud ſhed for the loue of God, he reſolued alſo to enter into combatt for IESVS CHRIST, reputing his repoſe wherin he liued for the ſeruice of God, to be nothing in reſpect of that courſe: O ſpiritt really happy, who not only was not terrified with the ſight of the bloudy ſword of the Tyrant, but was ſo encouraged therby, that the feruour of diuine charity in him was greater then the imbecillitie of humane fragillity. Wherfore thirſting to effect this good deſire, he reſolued firſt to take the habitt, and therwith to imitate the life of thoſe glorious Martyrs, by the ſame meane to obtaine the two crownes; and to aſcend from one degree vnto an other, to that ſoueraigne perfection of Martyrdome, exerciſing himſelfe before he entred into that conflictS. Antony becam att Frere Minor to goe in that kind to preach to the Infidels. and combatt. Now there were two Religious of ſainct Francis, which ordinarily liued in a Church of the title of ſainct Antony, without the Citty of Conimbria, with which ſainct Antony hauing caſually mett, he diſcouered his intention vnto them, as to two Angels of Paradiſe; and they gaue eare vnto him with great contentment and comforted him, then they appointed him a day when they would repaire vnto him to effect his pious deſire. Hauing taken leaue of them, he ceaſſed not to ſolicite and importune his ſuperiour, to vouchſafe to giue free conſent to this his holy intention, which as a thinge perordinated of God, he att length with much difficulty obtayned. The aforeſaid Frere Minors comming on the prefixed day, they gaue their habitt to ſainct Antony euen in the monaſtery of ſainct Croſſe; and then being cloathed, they carryed him with them to their oratory. Att his departure, one of the Canon Regulers that was much diſquieted therwith, ſaid vnto him; Well, goe your wayes in good time, it may be you may proue a ſainct, giuing him ſuch reproach, as if he thought one could not ſerue God but in the Religion of ſainct Francis: ſainct Antony humbly anſweared him: If it ſhould happen that I proue a ſainct, it may be you would praiſe God for it. But doubtles theſe Religious ſhould not murmure if God transferred this ſainct from their Order to that of ſainct Francis, conſidering that in their Church they poſſeſſed fiue of his martyrs, and with all it cannot be denyed but that the worthie and pious education of ſainct Antony, ought to be attributed firſt vnto God, and then to their holy Religion, wherein he ſpent eleuen yeares, ſo that he entred into the Order of ſainct Francis the 26. yeare

of his age, being then Prieſt, the yeare of grace 1220.
               
               
                  How the name of Ferdinand was chaunged into Antony, and how he departed for Marroccho, with intention there to receaue Martyrdome, and was by tempest driuen into Sicilia, thence he went into Italy, and thence to the generall chapter of S. Francis.
                  THE III. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father being come to the Oratory of the ſaid Religious, knowing that the title therof was ſainct Antony, he prayed them to giue him that name, abhorring his owne as ſeculer and too prophane, and to the end that not being ſo called of all, he might be much leſſe knowne, and disburded of his kinred and friendes: beſides we may well attribute this ſame to the worck of the holy Ghoſt, ſith that many of his moſt note-worthie elect haue▪ chaunged their name, as firſt the Patriarkes, Apoſtles, and other 
                        •
                     his fauourites. Hauing then thus chaunged his name, he deſired to effectuat the deſigne for which he became Frere Minor, and to attaine the ſame, he trauailed into Africa, there to receaue the crowne of Martyrdome; but he being afflicted with a great and long infirmity, began by diuine inſpiration to conceaue, that his deſigne was not gratefull vnto God, but that he would employ him in the entrepriſe of peace, where he muſt fight with a long and continuall martyrdome, not as a priuate ſoldier, but as a Capitaine and Doctour of many people; he therfore reſolued to experience and more clearly to enforme himſelfe of the will of God; And to that end embarqued himſelfe againe for Marroccho: but by a tempeſt he was driuen into the Ile of Sicilia, where being landed, he went to the Couent of Frere Minors, where he vnderſtood that they made preparation to goe to the Generall Chapter att Aſsiſium; wherfore, being aſſured of the will of God, he much reſiſted his owne proper will, and entirely reſigned himſelfe into the handes of his goodnes, and ſo in their company, he came to the Generall chapter: which ended, it was noted that he alone by certaine diuine diſpoſition, remayned vndemaunded of any Superiour, wherefore comming humblie to the Romane Proninciall called Brother Gratian, he prayed him to vouchſafe to demaund him of the holy Father ſainct Francis, and conſequentlie to inſtruct him together with the other Religious Nouices, in the ceremonies and obſeruations of the Order: So the true ſeruaunt of

God preſeruing the vertue of humility; made himſelfe generally to appeareGreat humility of. S. Antony. ignorant. Thus hauing obtayned what he deſired, he was no ſooner arriued att the Couent with his Superiour, but he prayed him to permitt him to liue ſolitarily in ſome ſequeſtred place; which was alſo graunted him, and a reſidence aloted him in a litle hermitage vpon the mountaine of ſainct Paul, where there was a litle Couent of other Religious of their Order; there he ſpent his time alone and in a priuate celle, ſeruing God in continuall meditations and prayers, fortifying his ſpiritt in his loue againſt the temptations of the deuill, and chaſtiſing his body by continuall abſtinence and faſtinges, refecting only and rarelie with bread and water, whereby he ſo weakened and ſubdued himſelfe, that his Brethren, walking ſometimes with him to conferre of ſpirituall matters, did teſtifie that he was ſo feeble as he could not ſtand on his feet, ſo that he ſeemed alwayes ready to fall. This elected ſpiritt of God, for a certaine time thus conuerſed as ignorant and ſimple, amongſt the ſimple, not preſuming to aſpire to any glorious act or notable enterpriſe, for the glorie of God and the ſaluation of faithfull ſoules, as being preuented of his firſt intention: But entierlie reſigned himſelfe vnto God, abſolutelie renouncing his owne will, it being alſo the moſt ſecure way that can be taken, and moſt pleaſing vnto God, who afterwardes in time and place maketh vſe of ſuch ſeruantes, as he did of this.
               
               
                  Of his firſt preaching, and how he was afterward made preacher by ſainct Francis.
                  THE IV. CHAPTER.
                  THe time of taking Orders being come, the F. Guardian of ſainct Antony being to ſend certaine of his Religious to receaue them, himſelfe would aſſociat them, and took ſainct Antony for his companion, ſo they were, with certaine Dominicans, together att Torlie, where the houre of collation being come, and they all att table, the Guardian began to entreat the ſaid Dominicans to make ſome exhortation for the conſolation of the companie: but they out of humilitie excuſing them ſelues, the Guardian, inſpired of God, commaunded ſainct Antony in vertue of obedience to ſpeake ſome thing for their edification, according as the holy Ghoſt ſhould dictate vnto him. The glorious Sainct as much as he poſsiblie could excuſed himſelfe, alleaging that he had neuer bin accuſtomed to any other thing in Religion but to waſh the ſhooe-clowtes, to lay the bucke, and dreſſe the kitchin, and

being ignorant he was leſſe fitt for ſuch an office then for any other: herein he ſpake nothing but what his Brethren there preſent knew to be true; ſo that he was eaſilie beleeued: for none had yet perceaued his learning, he hauing no bookes, but he had a notable and aſſured memorie, and in his mentall Prayers was of a verie high contemplation, two particuler giftes, wherwith God and nature had endued him, and withall he had well ſtudyed in former times; yet in ſpeaking latin he was verie ſober and ſparing. Being then vnable by his preceptes to reſiſt his obedience to his Guardian, who not admitting his excuſes as forcible, conſtrayned him to ſatisfie his commandement, he began to ſpeake ſimply: But the holyS. Antony preaching vnprouided by obedience was knowne to be a notable preacher. Ghoſt inſpiring and worcking where he pleaſeth, would not haue this his cleare burning light any longer hidden, but that he ſhould giue light and illuminate his holy Church, he I ſay, made him ſo to ſhine and appeare, that his audience perceauing his eloquence and his learning, both pourchaſed by practiſe and infuſed by God, they were all aſtoniſhed and amazed: but much more were they edified by his humility, in that he had ſo long time concealed this talent. The holy Frather ſainct Francis being hereof by the Guardian incontinently aduertiſed, giuing thanckes to God, he aucthoriſed him to be a preacher, and commaunded him to make vſe of the notable benefitt which his diuine Maieſty had beſtowed on him, and ſo he was choſen of God, and deputed to the holy Miniſtery of his word miraculously, and not by his owne induſtry; he alſo confirmed his doctrine by an entier and meere voluntary contempt of the world, and a moſt ſimple innocencie, by a perfect reſignation of his will into God, by mortification of his fleſh, and by a very deep humility, together with his charity towardes God and his neighbour, hauing a moſt feruent will to die in their cauſe, though God, for his greater croune, and the edification of the faithfull, diſpoſed otherwiſe of the effect: When he began to preach, as before he feared not to goe among the barbarous Pagans, much leſſe did he then feare being among Chriſtians, the power of Princes and Potentates of the world. So that without acception of perſonnes, indifferently he touched and ſtroake all ſortes of qualities with the ſword of God, yet alwayes vſing the meaner ſort more mildlie, to auoyde to ſcandalize them.
               
               
                  
                  How, where and of whome he learned, and after read Diuinity.
                  THE V. CHAPTER.
                  THis glorious S. was the firſt Religious of the Order of the Frere Minors, that ſtudied and read diuinity, with conſent and by permiſsion of the holy Father S. Francis, who ſent him to Verſelles, with an other called Brother Adā de Mariſco, an Engliſhman, to heare the Abbott of ſainct Andrew, a moſt famous diuine of that time, and one that had lately translated and commented vpon the workes of ſainct Denis Areopagita, out of Greeke into Latin: then it was that the Vniuerſity of Millan and Pauia, were transferred to Verſelles; the ſaid Abbot gaue thoſe Religious a gratefull countenance, for that he held himſelfe ſo edified by them, as he freely confeſſed that they taught him a doctrine, not humane, but heauenlie, and that he beheld in them, the hierarchies of Angels: theſe good Religious in the meane time profited exceedingly: for they attayned that very yeare to ſuch a ſublimity, and eleuation of vnderſtanding, that they ſeemed not only to haue formerly ſtudied the ſaid hierarchie, but euen to haue ſeene and frequented the ſame. Wherevpon the afore ſaid Abbot, in the third chapter of his ſaid commentary, oftentimes reiterateth theſe wordes: Loue penetrateth farther then exteriour ſcience can doe, as is read to haue appeared in many Biſhoppes, who not being learned, yet very ſubtilly penetrated to the deepeſt ſecrettes of the moſt ſacred Trinity, as my ſelfe haue experienced in the holy Religious Br. Antony, of the Order of Frere Minors, by the familier conuerſation which I haue had with himt: for albeit he was litle conuerſant in worldly ſciences, when he learned Myſticall diuinity, he ſo penetratiuely vnderſtood the ſame, that I may truely ſay of him that which IESVS CHRIST affirmed of S. Iohn Baptiſt, that he was a burning candell, that illuminated the world; in regard that he lightened the people exteriourly, by diuine knowledge wherwith he burned interiourly by a celeſtiall loue. Touching the lecture which he read, the licence which S. Francis ſent him was thus: Br. Francis, to his moſt deare Brother Antony, health. I am content that you read Diuinity to the Brethren, prouided that it be in ſuch ſort as that the ſpiritt of holy prayer be not weakened neither in you, nor them, according to the rule. He ſo reuerenced, ſainct Francis (whome he called Biſhop) that he would neuer read Diuinity, though he were by the Religious exceedingly importuned therevnto, till he had receaued the ſaid licence of him, by vertue wherof he firſt read att Montpellier in Languedoc, then att Bollonia, and att Padua: the greateſt

part of his learning he had obtained of God, alwayes eleuating his ſpiritt in him, as once it happened vnto him intending to preach before an Abbot of ſainct Benets Order, vpon the wordes of S. Paul, written to ſainct Denis, for att that time he continued a long ſpace rauiſhed in extaſie.
               
               
                  How he preached in France, and of the miracles he wrought there.
                  THE VI. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Antony was ſent into France, to be Guardian in the Couent of Limoges in Aquitaine, by his workes and predications to conuert many heretiques that then were there, and to confirme the Catholiques: which he ſo happely performed that the memory therof remayneth euen to our dayes, beſides many miracles which God there wrought by him; wherof we will recount ſome few. As he preached the Paſsion on Maundy thurſday night or good friday morning, in the Church of S. Peter of Quadruuio in Lymoges, at the ſame time that theS. A
                           ••
                        ony was twice ſeene in diuers places att one inſtant. Religious did ſolemnely ſing Matines in the Couēt, when they came to the leſſon that was to be read, he inſtantly appeared, and read it all yet without leauing the pulpit where he preached void of his preſence. It may be thought that God interpoſed the miniſtery of ſome Angell, that entertayned the people whiles he ſung the leſſon in the Qiuer. Almoſt the like accident arriued att Mōtpellier, where he was Lector, for, preaching one day to the people, he remembred that he had not appointed any one to ſing an Alleluia in his place, it being his office to ſing it: whiles he was preaching, he ſtouped in the pulpit as to repoſe himſelfe, and was att the ſame inſtant ſeene to ſing the Alleluia in his Couent, yet departed not from the great church where then he preached. This diuine vertue in S. Antony is not to be ſo much admired, as if the like had neuer bin, for the ſame arriued to S. Francis, when he was ſeene in a ſiery chariott, and when he appeared in forme of a croſſe att the Chapter of Arles, as in his life we haue related: And to S. Ambroſe, when in a moment he was preſent att the obſequies of S. Martin att Tours, though he was ſeene att Milan the very ſame time.
               
               
                  How he deliuered a Religious, and a Nouice, from great temptations.
                  THE VII. CHAPTER.
                  THere was in the ſaid Monaſtery of Limoges, a Nouice called Brother Peter, who was exceedingly tempted to leaue his habitt. S.

Antony as a right vigilant Paſtour ouer the flock of God, knew this temptation in ſpiritt, and therfore called and drew him a part, then cauſing him to open his mouth, he blew and breathed therin, ſaying, My ſonne, receaue the holy Ghoſt. O admirable accident? This Nouice fell inſtantly to the ground as dead. The other Religious haſtening to rayſe him, S. Antony took him by the hand and lifted him vp. The Nouice then affirmed that he had bin in heauen, and proceeding to recount what he had ſeene, the S. bid him to keep it ſecrett, which he did, and was neuer after tempted to leaue his habitt, but was an example of piety to all his Brethren. About the ſame time S. Antony being gone to the Abby of Semoniaco, depending on the biſhopprick of Limoges, a Religious of the ſaid Abby, was exceedinglie tempted with the fleſh, wherof finding no remedy by prayers, watchinges, or whatſoeuer other mortifications; he reſolued to haue recourſe vnto S. Antony, to whome in confeſsion he diſcouered the ſecrett of his hart, affectionatly beſeeching him for the loue of God to aſsiſt him. S. Antony hauing heard his confeſsion, putt off his owne coat, and gaue it to the Religious to putt on, which hauing done, he ſo as if the very vertue which was in the S. had bin in his coat, communicated vnto him his chaſtity, that the temptation for euer ceaſſed, as the Religious did diuers times afterward acknowledge and confeſſe.
               
               
                  Of the miracles which he wrought in France, vpon two that were very deuout vnto him.
                  THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                  IN the ſame citty of Limoges, an honeſt woman deuoted vnto him, and to his Order, had a very peruerſe husband, iealous, and without the feare of God, who did often beat and torment her becauſe ſhe did too readily addict her ſelfe to the ſeruice of S. Antony, and of his Couent, as well in beſtowing almoſe on them, as in procuring it of others, according to their neceſsity. It happened one day, that vpon ſome affaires of the Couent, ſhe priuately retired her ſelfe ſomewhat late, wherwith her husband was ſo vexed, that he cruelly beat and abuſed her; for he tooke her by the haire, and pulled it almoſt all off, but this vertuous woman carefully gathered it together, and layd it neatly on her pillow as if ſhe meant to make them grow againe, then ſimplie layd her ſelfe to reſt, and the next morning early, ſhe ſent for S. Antony, who came to her, ſuppoſing ſhe would be confeſſed. But ſhe related vnto him, what ſhe had endured for his ſeruice, ſhewing him her haire; and adding with all that ſhe beleeued, if he pleaſed to pray to God

for her, which ſhe beſought him to doe, her haire would take roote againe: the S. admiring hereatt, retourned to the monaſtery, where hauing aſſembled all the Religious, he recounted vnto them the affliction of this woman, and her requeſt: and therfore inuited them to pray together for her, which they did, and att the very inſtant the haires torne from this womans head were faſt rooted as before, whereatt her husbandBy the prayers of S. Antony haires torne off took root againe. was ſo amazed and withall ſo ſatisfied, that he reſolued thenceforward to be as gracious vnto his wife, as formerly he had bin curſt and cruell, beleeuing her to be an honeſt and chaſte woman, and from that time he ſhewed as much or more affection to the Frere Minors then his wife. S. Antony had cauſed a Couent to be built att Berne, a place depending on the ſaid biſhopprick of Limoges, vpon the declining of a mountaine, whither he very artificially drew a conduict of water: for deſcending from the ſame mountaine, it iſſued out faire and cleare, as out of a fountaine, ſufficient for the vſe of the ſaid Couent, which neuer failed them: the S. often repaired thither, to liue there more auſterely, and with better conueniencie to apply himſelfe to contemplation. The cooke one day telling him that there was nothinge to giue the ReligiousA stream of raine did not wett a maid employed in the ſeruice of the Frere Minors. their dinner, he ſent him to a lady exceedingly affectionate vnto him, to demaund of her ſome Colewortes for the dinner of the Religious, aduertiſing her that they alſo had nothinge to eat. This lady commanded her chamber maid, to gather ſome; but att the inſtant, there fell ſuch a ſtreame of raine that the mayd refuſed to goe; which her miſtris perceauing, ſhe prepared, notwithſtanding the raine, to goe gather▪ them her ſelfe, which her ſeruant ſeeing, ſhe preuented her miſtreſſe, and ſpeedily ran into the garden, to gather the Colewortes. But it was admirable to ſee, that this mayd went and retourned without one droppe of raine falling vpon her.
               
               
                  He knew the illuſions of the deuill, by diuine inſpiration.
                  THE IX. CHAPTER.
                  
                     S. Antony foretold that the deuil would trouble his ſermon. SAinct Antony being one day to preach in the ſaid biſhopprick of Limoges, in a Church of S. Iulian, there aſſembled ſuch a concourſe of people, that the Church being vnable to containe them, the S. was enforced to aſcend into a chaire ſeated on a ſcaffold, erected in a ſpacious place to that effect; and before he began to preach, he aduertiſed the people, that they ſhould not trouble themſelues with any thinge that might happen; during his ſermon, becauſe he knew well that the deuill with all his power would endeauour to diſquiett thē: but the end ſhould be his cōfuſion. So a litle after that he had begū, the ſupporters

of the ſcaffold brake with a great feare and crye of all▪ the audience: yet none receaued hurt therby, but being inſtantly reaccommodated, the ſermon was finiſhed, and heard with great deuotion, eſpecially in regard of the perſon that preached.
                  
                     And diſcouered a lye of the deuil to the ſame end. The S. preaching an other holy day, there came a Poſt into the Church that brought and preſented a letter to a gentlewoman, wherby ſhe was aduertiſed that her ſonne hauing ſome diſcordious quarrels was slaine by his ennemies: and the manner how. But the S. cryed out from the pulpitt where he preached, ſaying: diſquiett not your ſelfe, gentlewomā, nor you people be not troubled, for this trayterous Poſt is a deuill, that which is written in the letter, is falſe, you ſhall incontinently ſee her ſonne: the deuill hath played this pranck to diſturbe you. Herevpon the deuill vaniſhing, his fraud was diſcouered to be vaine: wherof the gentlewoman prayſed and thancked God.
                  The S. being att prayer one night after Compline, according to his cuſtome, it being in the monaſtery of Limoges, whence ſome of the Reliligious being gone foorth, they ſaw a great field appertayning to one of their freindes and benefactours, full of men that ſpoyled it, tearing of, the eares of the wheat already ripe: they pitying the loſſe of their affectedHe alſo diſcouered vnto his Religious an illuſiō of the deuil to diuert them frō

Wherto he anſweared: Trouble not your ſelues Brethren, with a matter of nothing, but retourne to prayer: for they whome you haue ſeene robbing, our friend, are diuels, that ſeeke to trouble vs, to diuert vs from prayer: know ye that our benefactour ſhall now receaue no detriment. The Religious obeyed their Superiour, expecting the iſſue hereof till the morning, when they ſaw the field as free from dommage as before; wherby they knew it to be an illuſion of the deuill; hauing therfore diſcouered his deceipt, they thenceforward had a more reuerence to the deuotion of the ſainct.
               
               
                  Of miracles wrought by the S. in his preachings.
                  THE X. CHAPTER.
                  AS Saint Antony was one day to preach at Limoges, there was ſuch a conconrſe of people aſſembled, that no Church in the citty could containe them, ſo that he was enforced to preach in the open aire. In the middeſt of his ſermon the sky began to be troubled and the weather chaunged, for it began furiously to lighten and thunder, then did the aire thicken with groſſe and very black cloudes, ſo that there was appearence of an extreame impetuous and inſtant raine; which cauſed the audience to reſolue of retiring themſelues. S.

Antony prayed them not to ſtirre, aſſuring them that no inconueniencie would befall thē, prouided that they put their confidence in him, whoAn extreme shower of raine did not wet nor fall vpon an audiē

On theſe wordes the people relyed, &amp; heard out the reſt of the ſermō, which ended, each one goeing out of that ſpacious place, where in former times had bin a very ancient Pallace, called by the Gentiles, the camp of Arcas, to retire to their home, it was admirable to ſee that euery where round about, the ſtreetes were all drowned and ouerflowne with the abondant ſtreame of the raine fallen from the skye, without ſo much as one droppe fallē in the ſaid field, which was abſolutely miraculous.
                  As he preached on a time, there was a foole that troubled all the audience, S. Antony admoniſhed him, and prayed him curteously to be quiett. But he anſweared the S. that he would not deſiſt, vnleſſe he would giue him the corde wherwith he was girded; which S. Antony putting of, deliuered vnto him. The foole hauing it, did preſently kiſſe it, and withall his fooliſhnes left him, and the vſe of reaſon retourned, and ſo he fell at the feet of the S. and demaunded him pardon, to the exceeding edification of the people.
                  S. Antony preaching in a towne, a woman hauing taken a cawdron of boylling water from the fire, to haſten to heare him, the deuill being vexed therwith, depriued her of her iudgement, which God permitted for his greater glory, ſo that in ſteed of putting her litle child into the cradle, ſhe putt him in that fiery hote cawdron, and ſo ran to the ſermon, which ended, her friendes, as the manner is, demanded of her how her child did; the poore woman preſently comming to her ſelfe, remembred that, thincking to lay her child in the cradle, ſhe had put him into the ſaid cawdrō; for which, being vtterly ouercome &amp; melting intoBy the merittes of the S. a child being in a cawdron of boilling water was not hurt. An other child raiſed from death. teares, ſhe rā with her other neighbours to her houſe, where ſhe foud her child playing in the ſaid cawdrō, as if he had bin in a bath; which cauſed the Mother &amp; her company to praiſe and thanck God &amp; his holy ſeruant.
                  Almoſt the like accident happened to a woman, in regard of her deſire to goe to his ſermon, for retourning ſhe found her child dead, ſtifled in the cradle where ſhe had layd him: wherfore retourning incontinently with her neigbours to the S. ſhe fell at his feet, beſeeching him to reſtore her, her child. Wherto the S. anſweared: Beloued ſiſter, retourne to your home, God will cōfort you: which making the womā exceeding ioyfull, ſhe ſpeedily haſtened home, where ſhe found her child aliue and ſound playing with litle ſtones, which neither ſhe nor he had ſeene before.
                  A yong man being conuerted by a ſermon of the S. deſired to confeſſe vnto him, but the ſobbinges, ſighes and teares which by a deep contrition, he poured out, would not permitt him to vtter one word, wherevpon the ſainct ſaid vnto him: My child, goe and write your

Antony cauſed the hart of a vſurer to be ſeene after death a mongst his mony. is thy hart: which ſermon being ended, he willed the kinred of the deceaſed, for better confirmation of what he had ſaid, to goe to his houſe and looke where he had layd his mony, telling them that there they ſhould find his hart, which was not with his bodye. So goeing with many people in company, they found the very hart of the vſurer amongſt his mony, yet hote, breathing, and beating: this miracle, with many others is painted att the Bolonia chappell of the Sarazins, intituled ſainct Perronelle.
               
               
                  Of the efficacie, vertue and feruour of his prayer.
                  THE XI. CHAPTER.
                  THe great vertue and efficacie of the prayer of ſainct Antony appeareth by many examples, in that not only other creatures,The deuil cauſed a ſtolne pſalter to be reſtored to S. Antony. but the infernall ſpirittes obeyed him, as by the ſequel ſhalbe diſcouered. When he did read diuinity att Montpellier, a Nouice ſecretly ran from the Couent, hauing ſtolne from him a pſalter commented by his owne hand, whereon he ſtudied to preach to his Religious, in which reſpect he much eſteemed it, ſo that knowing of this theft he was exceedingly troubled with all, and preſently had recourſe vnto prayer, where he enforced the Nouice to reſtore it. For as he was to paſſe ouer a bridge, the deuill appeared vnto him extremely horrible, hideous &amp; fearfull, and threatning to kill him with a ſword which he held in his hand, if he would not carry backe the pſalter to Brother Antony, he conſtrayned him to retourne, with ſuch terrour and contrition, that falling at the feet of the S. he obtayned pardon, and was againe admitted to the habitt.
                  This S. hauing accompliſhed his prefixed time of prelature att Limoges, he thought it conuenient to retourne to the chapiter. In his iorney he lodged in a towne at the houſe of a poore charitable woman, where God intending to confirme him in his grace, by ſome tribulation wherby his loue might appeare, permitted this woman, the more to honour him, to borrow of her neighbour, a faire cuppe of glaſſe, which his companion taking slight hold of, fell out of his handes, and brake in two peices, and the wine was ſpilled on the table; which the

carefull Martha perceauing (litle reſpecting the glaſſe) ran inſtantly and took a bottell, and carryed it to the Celler to fill with wine, for till then ſhe had only drawne in the ſaid drinking glaſſe, becauſe ſhe would not be too long in filling the bottell, and make the Religious that were already att the table, in the meane while to expect, determining to take the bottel when they were eating: But comming into the Celler, ſhe found that filling the glaſſe ſhe had bin too haſty and forgotten to thruſt faſt the faucett into the veſſell, ſo that the wine was all run out; wheratt exceedinglie greiuing, ſhe retourned all weeping to recount this miſhapp vnto the Sainct, who incontinently declining his head vpon his arme, prayed to God, and the glaſſe of itS. Antony by his prayers revnited a broken glaſſe, &amp; made wine retourne into a veſſell that was run out. ſelfe was ſodenly reunited; which the poore woman ſeeing, ſhe thought that as the glaſſe was conioyned, ſo the wine might alſo be retourned into the veſſell: wherfore running ſpeedily into the caue, ſhe found her veſſell fo full, though in the morning it were halfe emptie, that it wrought, as if it had bin new vnrefined wine, and ran out att the bung: wheratt being vtterly amazed and halfe beſide her ſelfe, ſhe ſcarce tooke time to ſerue the Sainct the reſt of his dinner, but that ſhe retired herſelfe to ſhunne occaſion of vaineglorie, leauing the inhabitantes of the towne piously diſpoſed, thenceforward to entertaine the holie ſeruantes of God, verely beleeuing (as in deed it is true) that wealth neuer faileth, but rather encreaſeth by charitable almoſe.

                  THE XII. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Antony for certaine dayes preaching in a citty of France, he was inuited by a deuout gentleman to accept a lodgeing in his houſe whiles he remayned there, alotting him the principall roome entier to himſelfe quietly to ſpend his time in ſtudy and deuotions: but this gentleman walking one night about his houſe, and paſsing by chaunce before the chamber of the Sainct, he ſaw a great light iſſuyng out through the chinckes of the dore, wherfore looking in att the key hole, he ſaw vpon a great booke lying before the Sainct a very faire child, glittering and ſhininge with reſplendant lightſome beames, who caſting himſelfe on the neck of the Sainct, did clip and embrace him: as alſo in extreme amorous manner the S. did the like, being neuer ſatisfied with beholding him. The ſweet and gracious child in his amiable embracinges reuealed vnto him that his hoſt beheld them. The Sainct knowing

that he would not depart as long as IESVS CHRIST, remayned there, was willing he ſhould for a time enioy his contenment in that admirable aſpect, that rauiſbed the ſoule of the gentleman out of the world; and then this p ecious child vaniſhing, the S. inſtantlie opened his chamber dore, and calling the gentleman, he coniu

                  Of his propheſie of a Martyr before he was borne, and of the ſame Martyrdome.
                  THE XIII. CHAPTER.
                  AS he viſited a woman att Aſsiſium, great with child and very nere her time, after he had exceedingly comforted her, ſhe recommended vnto his prayers her deliuery, that it might be happie and eaſy. He not vnmindfullof her, recommend her to our Lord, and the firſt time that he ſaw her againe, he propheſied and willed her not to feare, becauſe firſt ſhe ſhould be deliuered eaſilie; ſecondlie her child ſhould liue; thirdlie it ſhould be a man child: fourthlie he ſhould be pious and feare God: fiftlie he ſhould be a Frere Minor: and ſixtlie he ſhould be a Martyr. Now the three firſt of the conditions being eaſilie verified, it ſhall not be out of purpoſe alſo to iuſtifie the other three. The child then being borne, and baptiſed, was called Phillip, and liuing in manner of an Angell vntill he came to conuenient age, he became a Frere Minor, where being fortified in the feare and loue of God▪, he trauailed with exceeding deuotion in pilgrimage to the holie land. And being in Azoto, when it was by treaſon taken from the Chriſtians, who being in nomber two thouſand were all condemned to death, he obtayned of thoſe perſidious dogges to be the laſt that that ſhould be martyred, they ſuppoſing that he would renounce and deny IESVS CHRIST. But this Sainct when this ſpectacle horrible to the world, and gratefull to the diuine Maieſty and to him began, did animate and comfort them all with exceeding courage, crying vnto them, that God had reuealed vnto him, that the

very ſame day he ſhould aſcend into heauen with more then a thouſand martyrs: wherwith being much comforted they all offered their heades, as pleaſinge ſacrifices vnto God, vnder the ſword of the executioners, who cutt them off. Now it being reported vnto the Soldan that he exerciſced the office of a preacher; he commanded all the ioyntes of his fingers one by one to be all cutt off in preſence of the Chriſtians; which notwithſtanding he deſiſted not to exhort them all to that glorious victorie, in ſuch ſort that they all miſpriſing the honours and riches offered them, by the Mores, and the tortures wherwith they threatned them, being by the valour of the Saint confirmed in IESVS CHRIST, they with one voice cryed out, that they would follow Brother Philip, on whoſe choice oflife or Martyrdome they relyed; which the Soldan taking very deſpitefullie, cauſed him to be fleyed aliue, euen to the Nauell, and then his tongue to be cutt off, which ſupporting with ineſtimable conſtancie and notable patience, he the more enflamed and moued the rage and furie of rhe Mores, and the hartes of the Chriſtians more willingly to ſuffer death, as a momentarie matter, ſeeing him with an inuincible hart to endure the ſame, by ſuch cruell tormentes, in the middeſt wherof he ceaſſed not by the geſtures and motions of his bodie to exhort them, beeing vnable to ſpeake by reaſon that his tongue was bereaued him; Att length he was beheaded with the reſt, and in token of their croune (a thinge which the Mores beheld full ſore againſt their willes) their bodies that remayned many dayes in the ſtreet, without buryall, yelded no offenſiue, but a pleaſing ſauour: Thus was the admirable propheſie of the glorious Father S. Antony accompliſhed.
               
               
                  Of an other propheſie of his, touching an other Martyr, and of his Martyrdome.
                  THE XIV. CHAPTER.
                  PReaching in France in the citty of Puy where he was Guardian, as often as he ſaw a Notary, that was impious of life and conuerſatiō, he remouing his capuce would doe him very humble reuerence. The Notary knowing himſelfe vnworthy to receaue ſuch honour, by him that gaue it vnto him, hauing many times, endured the ſame, he imputed it to ſimplicity, yet att length he ſought to ſhunne the meeting of the S. turning from him a farre of, becauſe he would not be ſaluted by him: but it one time happened that he could not preuent the Sainctes meeting of him, who ſaluted him as before, yea more hūbly; which putting

the Notary into great choler, he came to him and ſaid: if thou wert not a Religious man, I would long agone haue ſheathed this my ſword in thy body. But tell me thou varlett, what cauſe haſt thou in this manner to flout me? The S. very humbly anſweared him: My beloued brother, be you not troubled, I beſeech you, but beleeue that I ſalute you only to honour you, and the reaſon is ſuch; hauing deſired to ſhed my bloud in the ſeruice of the diuine maieſty, I haue not bin found worthy nor hath it pleaſed God to ſatisfie me therein. But his diuine maieſty hauing reuealed vnto me that you ſhall dye a martyr, I haue euer ſince, and ſtill ſhall, yeld you reuerence. Beſides I moſt hartely beſeech you, when you ſhalbe in that glorious conflict, to be mindfull of me wretched ſinner. Hereat the Notary chaunged his choler into laughter, and deriding him went his way; but in ſhort time after, it was iuſtified. For being inſpired of God, to goe with the biſhop of the ſaid citty to adore the holy ſepulcher, and in an inſtant hauing changed his lewd conuerſation into the contrary, arriuing there, the biſhop diſcourſing with the Mores touching our faith, and being rudely refelled, the notarie for the firſt and ſecond time endured it, but att length being aſhamed of the tepedity of his biſhop, and fearing ſome worſe iſſue, he told him, that he did not defend our faith as he ought: and then himſelfe very couragiously diſputed againſt the Mores, and confuted them, affirming for their reproach, that their Mahomet was the ſonne of perdition, damned to hell by almighty God, as themſelues ſhould be if they did not acknowledge their errours: which hauing ſaid, the Mores preſently tooke hold of him, cruelly beat him, and neuer ceaſſed for three dayes together to torment him, which expired, leading him to execution he confeſſed to his other companions, that S. Antony had propheſied vnto him that martyrdome: And they afterward retourning, haue teſtified the ſame to all the world, and ſo he conſummating his martyrdome, ioyfully rendered his ſoule to his Creatour.
               
               
                  Of the office of his doctrine, and his ſeuerity againſt ſinnes.
                  THE XV. CHAPTER.
                  THis S. of God, with a very great dilligence, and admirable prudence, ſowed the word of his diuine maieſty in the ſoules of the faithfull, being neuer wearyed by his continuall labours, trauailling through diuers cittyes, townes, villages and caſtelles, ouer mountaines and vallyes, and this he did out of his extreme zeale to aſsiſt the ſoules redeemed by the precious bloud of our Lord, as one inſtructed rather by heauenly then humane doctrine, he ſo diſpoſed of his documentes

according to the neceſsity of his audience that they all were ſatisfied: in reſpect wherof his ſermons were reputed for ſo many miracles: they that neuer heard him preach, were att deathes dore with deſire to heare him, but eſpeciallie the learned, as well in regard of his eloquence, as of his exceeding ſubtility and viuacity of ſpiritt, wherwith he admirably gaue to althinges which he handled, their proper ſignification, valure, nomber and weight with a notable art. He alſo reprehended the great perſonnes of this world with ſuch conſtancie and ſeuerity, that the moſt famous preachers trembled with feare when they heard him, and did admire how it was poſsible he could haue ſuch boldnes: many would withdraw themſelues as not able to heare ſuch open and manifeſt reprehēſions, and thoſe that remayned couered their faces. Yet theſe reprehēſions were intermingled with a competent and iuſt quantitie of ſalt, which is the admirable vertue of diſcretion, according to opportunity of time, place, and perſonnes. For albeit his diſcourſe att the beginning ſeemed ſharpe, yet the concluſion was gracious, milde, and ſupportable to all, in ſuch ſort that without any ſcandall he terrified ſinners, comforted the weake, encouraged the puſillanimous, and made the moſt obſtinate to tremble.
                  Preaching one time att Bourges, where was held a Synode, he addreſſed his ſpeech to the arch-biſhoppe concerning certaine articlesHe knew in ſpiritt the errour and hereſie which a Prelat held in his hart and prudently putt him from it. of faith, wherof he interiourlie doubted, and ſo dextrously accuſed and reprehended his incredulitie, laying open vnto him his errours by many authorities of holy ſcripture, that the arch-biſhop was not onlie not ſcandalized therby, though in deed he felt himſelfe ſtung to the quick: but euen went directlie at the end of the ſermon, verie penitent and contrite, and freelie diſcouered his hart vnto him, who procured him ſuch remedie as was neceſſarie for his ſaluation, ſo that he proued thenceforward verie faithfull vnto his God. And this Sainct did not onlie aſsiſt the ſoules of the faithfull Chriſtians by preaching, but in diuers other manners, God alſo fauoured and furthered the ardent zeale which his ſeruant had of the ſaluation of ſoules, as when in the night he appeared vnto them, enforming them of their ſinnes, and admoniſhing them to goe to ſuch or ſuch a Confeſſour, telling them, how and by whome he was ſent vnto them, which was a ſinguler remedie for manie ſinners, who through feare or ſhame durſt not confeſſe, for feare to manifeſt their enormous ſinnes. But by the example following may appeare of what efficacie the wordes of the S. were.
                  A cittizen of Padua, called Leonard, confeſsing vnto ſainct Antony; among other ſinnes that he confeſſed, he accuſed himſelfe to

haue giuen ſuch a blow with his foot on his mothers belly, that ſhe fell to the ground. The Sainct very ſharply reprehending him for it, among other ſpeeches tould him, that the foot which dared to ſtrike the belly of the Mother whence it proceeded, deſerued tobe cutt offMat. 18. alleadging that ſentence of IESVS CHRIST: If thy foot ſcandalize thee, cutt it off and caſt it from thee, and ſuch other thingesGreat ſimplicity of a penitent. as might induce him to contrition. After the ſaid demonſtration, hauing giuen him abſolution, the ſimple man exceedinglie greeued att his offence, ſuppoſing that the Sainct had enioyned him to cutt off his foot, being in his lodgeing tooke a litle hatchett, and with a merueillous courage cutt off his foot: which done, the extremes of death aſſaulting him, the exceſsiue paine he endured cauſed him to cry ſo loud that his mother heard him, who with manie of her neighbours came running, and ſeeing the torment which he endured, adioyned her cryes with thoſe of her ſonne, who opening the cauſe of the diſaſter vnto her, ſhe knowing no other remedie, went to ſainct Antony, and reproached him as hauing slaineA man hauing cutt of his foot S.

The Saint vtterlie amazed, excuſed himſelfe with the truth, affirming that he had not bin the cauſe, hauing onlie told him that it deſerued to be cutt off, but not willed him to cutt or cauſe it to be cutt off: but not content with anſwearing her he went to ſee him, and being moued with his pious ſimplicitie, after he had firſt offered his prayers to God, he tooke the foot from vnder a bench, and ioyned it vnto the legge, whervpon he gaue a benediction, and ſo reioyned them, that there remayned neither ſigne nor any pain

                  How he reprehended the tirant Ezelin.
                  THE XVI. CHAPTER.
                  EZelin a tyrant of Padua, hauing by fauour and ſupport of the Emperour Federic the ſecond, gotten the dominion of many faire and great citties of Italy, he exerciſed ſuch crueltyes the like wherof haue not bin heard, to make himſelfe more feared of his ſubiectes, and none durſt to reprehend him or demaund him the reaſon. Hauing one time without cauſe slaine diuers gentlemen of note, ſainct Antony reſolued to goe and performe his office vnto him. And comming before him, he ſpake in this manner: Cruell tyrant and ennemy of God, when wilt thou end thy rage, and forbeare to ſhedde

the bloud of faithfull Chriſtians, which without cauſe thou ordinarily ſpilleſt? Know and aſſuredly beleeue, that the ſeuere and terrible ſentence of the iuſtice of God doth attend and will fall vpon thee, when thou leaſt feareſt it. To theſe wordes he added many other like, then obiecting vnto him the graces and fauours which he had receaued of God, he oppoſed alſo the homicides, violences, robberies, murtherous aſſaultes, and inſupportable tolles wherwith he afflicted his ſubiectes, and how by his permiſsion, they endured the deſtructions of whole citties. As he ſpake this, his guard admiring this free ſpeech, expected onlie the Tyrantes commaund toA Tyrant humbled himſelfe att the remonstrances of S. Antony. maſſacre him, thincking this his accuſtomed patience verie ſtrange, eſpecially vpon ſuch iniuries: but the ſucceſſe was other then they expected, for the Sainct hauing ended his diſcourſe, this cruell woulfe att the ſame inſtant became a meek lambe, and hauing put off his girdle, he layd it on his necke, and fell at his feet calling for mercie vnto God and him for his miſdeedes, and promiſing for ſatisfaction to his diuine Maiſtie, that he would accept and performe ſuch penance as he ſhould impoſe vpon him. The people preſent were alſo in admiration att this Metamorphiſes of the Tyrant, as much as att the rayſing of a dead. Now the Saint departing vpon aſſeurance of this good promiſe, Ezelin turning to his people, ſaid vnto them: Doe not admire to ſee me for the preſent thus humbled: for I proteſt I ſaw to proceeed out of the face of this holie Father a beame of diuine ſplendour, which did ſo terrefie and quelle me, that I ſeemed to ſinck into hell. But God minding to chaſtice his ennemies by the handes of others of his ennemies, permitted that this Tyrant kept not long his holy purpoſe, for he began to doubt of the vertue of the Sainct, of whome he would make a ſecond triall. Knowing that he publikelie preached againſt his cruelties, he ſent him a preſent by ſome of his people, to whome he gaue chardge, that if the SainctThe tyrant tēpteth S. Antony. accepted the preſent, they ſhould kill him: but if he reiected it, they ſhould patientlie endure what ſoeuer he ſayd, without giuing him any replie, and ſo ſhould retourne. They hauing offered vnto the Sainct the preſent which was of great value, with the greateſt humilitie they could faine, praying him to accept the ſmall charitie which Ezelin had ſent him, and to pray to God for him, therby experienced what he was: for he anſweared them, God preſerue me me from receauing this preſent, which is but the bloud of the poore of IESVS CHRIST, wherof he muſt render a ſtrict account vnto God: and therfore haſt yee ſpeedily hence, for feare leaſt this houſe fall and vtterly oppreſſe you, or that the earth

open and ſwallow you vp. Theſe wordes made them ſo aſhamed and mute, that without replying they retourned to giue anſweare to Ezelin, who thenceforth eſteemed him the true ſeruant of God: and therfore willed his people to permitt him to ſay of him what he would, which was no ſmall reſtrainct vnto him whileſt he liued.
               
               
                  How att one ſermon of his, he conuerted 22. theeues.
                  THE XVII. CHAPTER.
                  TWo and twenty theues being aſſembled for robbery, retired into a very thick and buſhy wood, where they murdered the paſſangers: Italy was then (by reaſon of the warres there) full of ſuch theeues, who feared not to goe diſguiſed into the citties, as did theſe of whome we ſpeake, who reſolued to proue if the truth and effect anſweared the reputation giuen to the preachinges of S. Antony: for they had heard, that as an other Elias, he burned the hartes of men with the fiery light of the word of God: which they experienced in themſelues: for att the beginning of his ſermon, they began to feele their hartes to mollifie: then by litle and litle to receaue the heat of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo that att the end of the ſermon, they went all to conferre with him, who after he had giuen them neceſſary reprehenſion, told them that he would abſolue them on condition they would be very wary neuer after to retourne to their vomitt, aſſuring the in the behalfe of almighty God, that if they fell againe they would miſerably periſh: as it after arriued to ſome of them, who retourned to their filth againe as before: others perſeuered piously, and eſpecially one of them, who had ſeriously obſerued and made his profitt of the endes of both his good and bad companiōs▪ who afterwardes affirmed and aſſured the ſame, and ſaid that he was enioyned, to goe twice to Rome in penance, to viſitt the holy Apoſtles in remiſsion of their enormous ſinnes, ſaying that as he had accompliſhed his penance, ſo did he hope to obtaine remiſsiō of his miſdeedes.
               
               
                  Of the conuerſion of many heritikes, by a ſermon which S. Antony made to the fishes of the ſea, which gaue him eare.
                  THE XVIII. CHAPTER.
                  ITaly being vtterly diſordered, by the afforeſaid warres, and mingled with all nations that embrued their barbarous weapons in the body of that contry, though they were called in by the Italians themſelues, that ſuppoſing to ruinate each other, they might afterwardes be

their prey, as in deed they were: In ſuch troubles of warre, the Italians did not only diminiſh their former vertues, which made them like terreſtriall Angels, and more excellent then all other ſtrangers in curteſie and loue, but they did alſo diminiſh that faith, for which they had renounced the Empire of the world, ſubmitting their neck to the moſt ſweet yoke of IESVS CHRIST, and of his immaculate and holy, Catholike Apoſtolike and Roman Church; and beſides that, (as it is incident to men to admitt the habitt of thoſe with whome they conuerſe) they dranck the horrible cup of hereſie and abomination, the heretikes multiplying in Italy, by the extreme liberty of life then there in vſe. Now ſainct Antony hauing ſo much profited in France, where he conuerted a great nomber of heretikes, as alſo in Romania, whither then many were retyred, of whome he conuerted a great part by miracles, and particulerly their Arch-heretique called Bonuillo de Bimini, who for thirty yeares had perſiſted obſtinate and buryed in the darcknes of hereſie: the ſainct therfore endeauoured to diſplant all the reſt of that prouince which there were exceedinglie augmented. Now as he one day preached vnto them, they refuſing to heare him▪ becauſe diſputing againſt them he did vtterly confound them, and being without the ſea ſhoare, att the mouth of a riuer called Matecchia, he called the fiſhes in the name of God, to heare his holy word, ſith men, whome he had redeemed by the precious bloud of our Lord IESVS CHRIST his only Sonne, had refuſed it. It was a worthy and admirable thing, to ſee almoſt an infinite quantity of fiſhes of the ſea and of the ſaid riuer, inſtantly vpō thoſe wordes to appeare on the water, which by litle and litle aſſēbling, ſorted themſelues according to their kindes and qualities, placing themſelues in admirable Order, ſo that the leſſer drew neereſt the ſhoare, and the greater by degrees without, in ſuch ſort that it was a moſt pleaſing ſight to behold them. Being ſetled and accomodated, the ſainct made them this ſermon following: My Brethren fiſhes, who being the creaturesOf the fauours which God beſtoweth on fishes. of the comon Creatour as we are, are alſo bound to prayſe him, conſidering that you haue receaued of him your being and life, and he hath giuen you for habitation the noble element of water ſauoury &amp; ſaltiſh, according to your neceſsity and entertaynement. Further he hath therein giuen you ſhelters and retraites to ſhroud you from the ambuſhes of your perſecutors. It hath pleaſed him alſo that this element ſhould be tranſparent, cleare, and pearceable to the eye, that you may the more eaſily ſee what you are to accept and what to ſhunne: therfore alſo hath he beſtowed on you phinnes and force to guide you ſelues where you deſire: but you are eſpecially obliged vnto him, for that you alone of all other creatures, were ſaued in the vniuerſal deluge; by meanes whereof you are encreaſed in nomber aboue all other. You were choſen to ſaue the

Prophett Ionas, and hauing preſerued him three dayes in your belly, you reſtored him a liue vpon the earth. You haue payed the due and tribut for our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and for his chiefe Apoſtle S. Peter, you haue alſo euer bin his food during his life, and after his death when he was riſen. For which reaſons and others which for the preſent are out of my memory, you are exceedingly obliged to thancke almighty God. The fiſhes approued theſe wordes, with all the geſtures they could ſhew, bending downe their heades, mouing their tailes, and making ſigne of deſire to come neere him. Vpon which demonſtratiōs, the holy Father tourned towardes the rebellious and ſtony hartes of the heretikes, and, in preſence of a great multitude of people (there aſſembled by the recourſe of ſuch a nomber of fiſhes that ſtirred not, expecting till the S. diſmiſſed them) he ſaid vnto them: God be prayſed that the very fiſhes doe deſireously heare his word, but you, wherfore demurre you on your conuerſion? What other teſtimony doe you expect more euident of the vertue of the loue of God? Are not you aſhamed to appeare of leſſe vertue then the fiſhes who are voyd of reasō? All the heretikes there presēt thē without farther expectation were cōuerted to the faith, and the Catholiques more ſolidly cōfirmed. The fiſhes neuer ſtirred, but their nūber ſtill encreaſed without any confuſiō of their order, till they had all had the benediction of the holy Father, after which they diuided thēſelues, &amp; each one went where he pleaſed, and S. Antony retourning into Riminy there conuerted the reſt of the heretiques, that being there had not bin preſent att the miracle.
               
               
                  How he conuerted a very obſtinate heretike by a miracle of the bleſsed ſacramēt.
                  THE XIX. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Antony preaching one time att Tholousſe (though ſome affirme it to be att Riminy) againſt a very obſtinate heretike, of the reall Preſence of IESVS C. in the B. Sacrament, he many times cō
                     uinced him euen by reaſons, in which the heretike not knowing what to anſweare, told the S. that in deed he was forced to yeld in diſpute: but the reaſon was, becauſe he was more ſubtill, a greater philoſopher, and better learned then himſelfe, which he acknowledged: but could not yet confeſſe and acknowledge that his affirmations were to be beleeued: and therfore challenged him to proue by effectes and ſhew him by ſome miracle of the B. Sacrament, wherby he might know that God was preſent there: which if he could performe, he did promiſe and ſweare, to adhere to his opinion and beliefe. The ſainct anſweared him that he ſhould conſider and bethinck himſelfe what miracle

he deſired, &amp; by the grace of God he ſhould ſee it effected. The heretike replyed that he would ſhutt vp a mule, and keep her three dayes without meat, then they both would be preſent together, himſelfe with ores &amp; the S. with the B. Sacrament, and if the mule did leaue the otes and adore the B. Sacrament, he would be content alſo to adore the ſame. S. Antony accepted this condition: And the third day being come, &amp; they both preſent att a publike place, the holy Father hauing celebrated maſſe before he communicated, he ſhewed the ſacred Hoſt vnto the people that held burning torches in their handes, there being preſente the greateſt perſonnes of the cittie, who attended him to the place where the proofe was to be made. The heretike was there ready with the hungry Mule, which alreadie ſmelled the oates which her maſter had brought and brayed after them. Sainct Antonie thenA hungry mule left oases to adore the B. Sacrament. commaunded her, by the vertue of the liuing God, who was preſent in the Hoſt which there he held to adore it. Her maſter alſo caſt before her all the oates he had, yet leauing the oates, ſhe came with her head declined very humbly to adore the B. Sacrament, before which ſhe kneeled downe, to the exceeding contentment of the Catholikes there preſent, and the confuſion of many heritikes, eſpecially of the aforeſaid, who was conuerted together with them.
               
               
                  Of the conuerſion of many heritikes, by a miracle of S. Antonyes, eating poyſoned meat, without receauing any detriment.
                  THE XX. CHAPTER.
                  THis miracle ſo encreaſed the hatred of heretikes againſt him▪ that they reſolued to procure his death. And to this purpoſe one of them inuited him to his table: which the ſainct promiſed, in hope by ſome familier diſcourſes to conuert him. Euen as for the ſame end our Redeemer did eat with Publicans and ſinners. Sainct Antony then being att table with manie heretikes, he knew by diuine reuelation, that the meat ſett before him was poyſoned, as alſo the wine appointed for him to drinck, for which he modeſtly checked them, 
                        〈…〉
                      their treachery. But they, in ſteed of being confounded and acknowledgeing their fact, with a braſen face anſweared him, that IESVS CHRISTMarc. 16. in his goſpell promiſed his diſciples, that albeit they ſhould drinck or eat poyſon, it ſhould not hurt them: And therfore (ſayd they) had they done that onlie to proue that ſpeech, ſo that if he refuſed to eat therof, he muſt acknowledge the Goſpell to be falſe: wherevpon the holy Father, conſulting with himſelfe what he ſhould doe, foūd

therin ſome difficulty; for one the one ſide he feared it might proue a tempting of God, who ſeemed to haue reuealed the ſame vnto him to the end he ſhould forbeare it: on the other ſide deſirous not to preiudice the goſpell, he reſolued to eat the poyſon, on condition they would become Catholikes, if it did not hurt him: wherto they accorded, and the S. ſaid vnto them: Well then my maſters, I drinck and eat your poyſonned meat and drinck, not with a will to tempt God, whoſe wordes I firmely beleeue: but to manifeſt vnto you the truth of his word, and alſo as zealous of his goſpell to whome althinges obey: then he dranck and eat therof without receauing any detriment, either then or afterward. Which the heretikes perceauing, they were conuerted to the faith of the goſpell, the wordes wherof they had experienced to be puiſſant, aboue all naturall reaſon, and in deed it was reaſonable, they ſhould expell the poyſon out of their ſoules, ſeeing corporall poyſon, by vertue of the wordes of the goſpell, to be annichilated.
               
               
                  How in one ſermon and att one time, he was heard by many ſtrangers to preach in their ſeuerall languages: and a woman heard him far off.
                  THE XXI. CHAPTER.
                  POpe Gregory the ninth publiſhed a great Iubilie att Rome, there to declare the expedition of the Chriſtians called Croiſade, againſt the Mores, who then had poſſeſsion of the holy land: in reſpect wherof there was a great concourſe of people att Rome that repayred thither from all partes of Europe. S. Antony one day preaching there before a huge aſſembly of people, the nomber being exceeding great of French, Grecians, Engliſh, Italians, Almanes, Sclauonians, Spaniards, and other ſtrangers, they all heard him preach in their owne naturall tongue, as heretofore the Apoſtles of our Sauiour had bin: which much amazed the people. But beſides this, the Pope hauing heard this ſermon, called him the holy arke of the teſtament, in regard of the merueillous copioſity of h
                        ••
                      doctrine and eloquence, wherwith he in ſuch ſort lincked▪ together, the ſentences and wordes of holy ſcripture, by new and high 
                        〈…〉
                      wherby it manifeſtly appeared that it was not he but the holy Ghoſt that ſpake, who by his holy ſeruant taught theſe people the true meane to aſcend to heauen. This other miracle was alſo of no ſmall conſequence.
                  A woman exceedingly deſiring to heare S. Antony preach, her huſband not permitting her to goe, becauſe it was a great league from the citty, ſhe went vp into her corne-loft, ſo to content her ſight with beholding the place where her ſpiritt was, to witt, the Church where

was the Sainct, where her body could not be: which performing very attentiuely and a long time, ſhe admired to heare the Sainct beginne his ſermon, wherfore calling her husband, ſhe proteſted that from the place where ſhe was, ſhe miraculously heard ſainct Antonyes ſermon, vſing the ſame geſtures that he did and relating his wordes, wherin ſhe ſo perſiſted to confirme hir husband, that himſelfe would needes make triall therof, and to that end mounting into the garrett, he putt his head out att the windoe, and heard the end of the ſame ſermon, then preſentlie went to conferre with ſuch as had bin perſonallie preſent, and found that the wordes which his wife affirmed to haue heard in the beginning of the ſermon, were the verie ſame that the Sainct had vttered. And therfore aſtonyed att ſo great a miracle, and repenting that he had hindred his wife from being preſent therat, neuer after withdrew her from her deuotions.
               
               
                  Of certeine miracles which he wrought vpon ſome that were deuout vnto him.
                  THE XXII. CHAPTER.
                  SAinct Antony inceſſantlie labouring to gaine ſoules vnto God in the cities of Italy, by his preaching, retourning one day from that exerciſe, and retiring into his Couent, he tooke a ſecrett and vnknowne way, to auoyd the honours ordinarilie giuen vnto him, where he mett a poore woman carrying her ſonne▪ that was vtterly crypled and voyd of the vſe of his limmes, who hauing a farre off perceaued him, came and fell at his feet, humbly praying him to haue compaſsion of her, and to voutſafe to make only the ſigne of the croſſe vpon her ſonne, wherby ſhe had great confidence in God, that he would recouer the vſe of his limmes: and the more the Sainct excuſed himſelfe, the more ſhe redoubled her petitions and cryes, ſaying as the Chanan

                     And an other. A girle of Padua was in ſuch ſort cripled, that ſhe could not goe but on her handes, and beſides, was often tormented with the falling ſicknes, which cauſed her to foame and vſe ſtrange geſtures through

the extremity of her cruell affliction; her father hauing preſented her to the S. and requeſted him, as the aforeſaid mother had done, he cured her by the ſigne of the croſſe alſo; wherin is to be obſerued, that in ſuch occurences the faith of thoſe that preſent and requeſt, ioyned with the merittes of the Sainctes auayleth much, to obtaine grace and fauour of God.
                  The holy Father goeing one holy day to preach in a ſpacious place, there being no Church great enough to containe the people thatA womā fell into a filthy ditch without fouling hir apparell, by the meritts of the S. ſought to heare him, a woman that followed the preſſe of the people, was att lenght ſo thruſt, that ſhe could not auoyd to be ouerthrowne into a ditch full of filth, wherwith the woman being much greiued, not ſo much for the apprehenſion of the hurt ſhe might receaue in her body, as for feare to foule her rich apparell wherof that was the firſt time of wearing, and that her husband who was peruerſe vnto her would be offended with her, had recourſe vnto God by the merittes of the S. that ſhe went to heare, whome ſhe deuoutly inuocated, and herewith ſhe was ſeene to ariſe out of the dirt wherin ſhe had bin plunged, without any appearance of ordure on her apparell, to the exceeding amazement of all the beholders.
               
               
                  Hauing written a letter to his prouinciall, an Angel carryed it, and brought anſweare therof.
                  THE XXIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe Sainct hauing ſpent long time in preaching, hearing Confeſsions, giuing counſaile, and reading att Padua, he much deſired to retire himſelfe into ſome ſolitarie place, where he might more commodiouslie applie himſelfe to contemplation, and to that end, he wrote to his Prouinciall, the which he accorded him: and hauing left this letter vpon a table in his Cell, he went to pray his Guardian to procure him ſome meſſenger to carry the ſaid letter faithfully to the Prouinciall, which the Guardian hauing done, he retourned to his cell, but found not the letter: which made him ſuppoſe that God had miraculouslie taken it away, to the end he ſhould not remoue thence, wherfore retourning to his Guardian, he told him he was otherwiſe determined: But certaine dayes after, in ſuch a time as a meſſenger might carry the letter and bring anſweare therof, he found on his table the anſweare which his Prouinciall had made therevnto, permitting him to retire; and doubtles there is great appearance that this letter was carryed, and the anſweare brought by an Angell, God therby giuing vs to vnderſtand,

how pleaſing and gratefull the demandes of his faithfull ſeruantes are vnto him.
               
               
                  How he was twice in ſpirit at Lysbone in Portugall, to aſsiſt his father.
                  THE XXIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe Father of the Sainct was a gentleman of Portugall reſiding att Lisbone, who hauing managed a good part of the reuenue of the king his ſoueraine, had alſo giuen a iuſt account therof vnto his officers, and withall deliuered them in, the mony without demaunding acquittance or any diſchardge, relying on them as his freindes, attleaſt ſuppoſing them to be ſuch: but certaine monthes after, theſe gentle companions, as worldly people, demanded againe the mony they had receaued of him, and ſummoned him to yeld a new account vnto them of the adminiſtration of the mony he had in his chardge. This good gentleman was exceedinglie amazed, not knowing what to doe, conſidering he had no ſpecialty to help himſelfe againſt them in that which they required; wherfore knowing the danger of his owne caſe, he went to them, to endeauour to put them in minde of the finiſhing and deliuery of his accountes, thincking therby to bring them in the end to acknowledge and confeſſe the truth. And being before them that ſate and held the place of iuſtice, they moſt audaciously and impudently denyed that he had ſo much as preſented his accountes, much leſſe had heS. Antony cauſed an acquittance to be giuen to his father which was deliuered him and forwhich he was much trobled. finiſhed them and deliuered them any mony. But att the inſtant S. Antony appeared, and was preſent there, who grauely ſayd vnto them: Giue an quittance to this good man, of the mony he deliuered you proceeding of his chardge, and of the receipt of the kinges mony, on ſuch a day, in ſuch a place, att ſuch an houre, in ſuch and ſuch ſortes of coyne: which if you refuſe to doe, God will puniſh you for it. Which they hauing heard, exceedingly terrified, they gaue a ſufficient diſchardge to the Father of the S. who very ioyfully retourned home, giuing thanckes to God for that he had beſtowed on him ſuch a ſonne, who vaniſhed as ſoone as he had vttered thoſe wordes.
                  Some time after, there was a yong man slaine before the houſe of the Sainctes Father, for whome his ennemies had laid waite in the night as he was to retourne from the great church, which is neere to the ſaid houſe, into the garden wherof the dead body was caſt ouer the walles, where the next morning he was found of the officers, by the trace of bloud freſhly appearing in the ſtreet: whervpon the Father of ſainct Antony, with all his family were impriſonned, and foorth with condemned to death: and as he was conducted to execution,

                     He rayſed one murdered to make him teſtifie that his Father had not ſlain him, and to abſolue him of an excō
                        municatiō, who afterwardes fel dead againe as before. the S. being preachinge att Padua it was reuealed vnto him, who then reſting on the pulpitt wherin he preached, he went to relieue his Father, and att the very inſtant of his comming to Lisbone, he rayſed the murdered party, and made him publiquely to confeſſe that his Father had not slaine him; yet not diſcouering the murderers. The party rayſed then tourning to the ſainct demaunded abſolution of him, of an excommunication which he had incurred, and beſought him to pray to God for his ſoule: which the ſainct hauing graunted him, he fell dead into the graue. And by this meane in one inſtant he deliuered his father from corporall death, and the murdered perſon from eternall; then retourned to his ſermon, and being inſpired of God, he reuealed vnto the people where he had bin. Many of Padua wrote to Lisbone of curioſity to be enformed hereof, and were aſcertained of the verity; by which meane thoſe of Portugall were more perfectly reſolued of the matter.
               
               
                  How he endeauoured to preſerue his Order in the ancient and first obſeruance, and how for that end he cauſed Brother Helias to be diſplaced, who had bin by the Pope, constituted and named Generall, after the death of Br. Iohn Parent.
                  THE XXV. CHAPTER.
                  AS S. Antony himſelfe moſt exactly obſerued what concerned the Order wherof he made profeſsion, ſo alſo could he not in any ſort endure the diſſolution which he too manifeſtly perceaued, wherfore now reprehending this Br. now that, he ſuffred many tribulations att their handes, which he did not much regard, ſo that he might effect what he deſired, to which purpoſe he endeuoured to vnite and gaine vnto him many ancient and feruent Religious, with them to reſiſt the relaxations of the principall Religious, who eſpecially were thoſe that depraued the Order, and of theſe the principall was Br. Helias, as being alſo chiefe of the Religion, made Generall therof by Pope Gregory the ninth, after the death of Brother Iohn Parent, who being learned, very expert in worldly affaires, and fauoured of many great perſonnes, attempted, after the death of S. Francis, to demaund diuers priuiledges of the court of Rome, which he obtayned for himſelfe and the Religious: wherein he wanted not ſuch as would ſecond him for this new liberty of life, and the lardge way which he had opened. So by the ſupport and aſsiſtance of his followers and adherentes, he cruellie perſecuted thoſe that did contrary him, and eſpeciallie all the companions &amp; firſt diſciples of S. Francis, and next to them S. Antony, and Br. Adam his companion, as zealous of the Order, who att length no longer able

to endure ſuch a ruine, oppoſed themſelues againſt him publiquelie att the Chapter, where they fouud not any one of their opinion, or att leaſt that durſt ſpeake a word, ſo that all the Religious there preſent aroſe againſt them, chardgeing thē that they murmured, cauſed and rayſed diuiſion in Religion, and therfor they were ſo perſecuted, that they were enforced to appeale touching their abuſes vnto the Pope, and to that end to goe to Rome; where being arriued (notwithſtanding the endeauour of Brother Helias, who ſought to gett them impriſoned by the way) in preſence of the ſaid Pope, who was a ſinguler fauourer and protectour of the Order, they layd open the life of Br. Helias and the relaxation of the diſcipline of the Order, which by his euill example he peruerted and brought to ruine. Which being well vnderſtoode and conſidered by his Holineſſe, he ordayned a generall Chapter to be held att Rome, wherein himſelfe in perſon was Preſident. Now this chapter being aſſembled, S. Antony propoſed the cauſe of his appeale vnto the Pope, alleadging that it was vpon the perſecution which B. Helias inflicted on thoſe that were zealous of the Order, as ennemies of the relaxation and liberty of his life &amp; new rule, which tēded to the ruine &amp; ſubuerſion of the Religion, cōtrary to the obligatiō &amp; duety of the Generall therof. Br. Helias herevnto anſweared, that he had bin forced by the Religious to accept of that office, that he had aduertiſed thē that he could not goe on foot, nor liue in cōmune by reaſon of many neceſsities of his, &amp; that in a Generall Cha▪ they had permitted him, to eat what he would, yea, gold if it were needfull. Beſides, that hauing a horſe in the ſtable, he muſt of neceſsity haue a ſeruāt, &amp; cōſequently could not be without mony, wherof he had permiſsiō frō the holy Sea, as alſo for ſupply of ſome neceſsities, and likewiſe for building the Church of Aſsiſiū and to relieue many Religious, in their occaſions. S. Antony replyed that albeit he were permitted to vſe a horſe, yet was he not allowed to maintaine a horſe in ſtable of ſuch a price as he did, and ſo well furniſhed, as all the world was ſcandalized theratt, and though he were permitted to eat euen gold in his neceſsity, yet was it not graunted he ſhould horde and heap vp treaſures. Brother Helias then anſweared S. Antony, that he had lyed: whereatt the Pope who was well enformed of the truth of his life, did much admire, and would no further teſtimony againſt him, then this his proud anſweare, which made cleare the reſt: and therfore hauing comanded ſilence to all, with teares in his eyes, he vttered theſe wordes; whē I reſolued to make this Religious Generall, I thought it would haue bin for the good of the Order: but alas I experience the contrarie, and ſee that he is a diſturber and ruinour therof. Wherfore I depriue him of that office, and will that in his place be preſently elected on other, that is zealous and a protectour of the Euangelicall law. Which

done, the Pope exceedinglie commended S. Antony, and gaue him his benediction, diſapprouing and making voyd the ſentences which Br. Helias had denounced againſt him, and thoſe that were zealous of the Order, then prayed and exhorted him to aſſemble and committ to writing all his ſermons, that they might be printed and yeld a publike profitt: and that he might more commodionsly apply himſelfe therto, he by ſpeciall priuiledge exempted him from all other offices and chardges of the Religion. and thenceforward was euer much affected vnto him, ſo farre forth as after his death he canonized him.
               
               
                  Of the laſt lent that he preached, of the great fruit of his preaching, and of his pious worckes.
                  THE XXVI. CHAPTER.
                  BEcauſe it would be perhappes more tedious to you to read, then to me particulerly to deſcribe all the Prouinces, where this glorious S. hath preached, and conſequently the affection, reuerence and deuotion, which all perſonnes, as wel Princes, gentlemen, burgeſſes, as the meaner people carryed towardes him, and how well, by his doctrine, life and miracles, he recouered to almighty God the loſt ſoules, I will endeauour, to make the ſame appeare vnto you altogether by the onlie relation of the laſt ſermons he made att Padua, in a lent that he preached there. This ſainct then being exempted by the Pope as before is ſaid, the yeare of grace 1230. in a Generall Chapter held in the month of May, that he might the more commodiously employ himſelfe for the ſaluation of ſoules, hauing paſſed and trauelled ouer manie Prouinces, in all which he ſowed the word of God, he was att length by the holie Ghoſt conducted to Padua, where he had formerly much profited; In reſpect wherof he was very particulerlie loued and reuerenced of the inhabitantes of that citty; and therfore when he began to preach there againe, ſuch was the confluence of people that preſſed to heare him, that he was forced to preach in a ſpacious field without the Cittie, there being no Church capable of the people that from all partes flocked thither, though there were ſome verie great. Wherfore from the beginning of Lent, the deuill perceauing the great fruit which he did and would produce, he tooke him, and ſo wreſted and cruſhed his throat, that as he after confeſſed to his companion, if the ſacred virgin, whome he inuocated had not aſsiſted him, appearing vnto him with a great light and to his confort, he had bin ſtrangled: but arming himſelfe with the ſigne of the croſſe, and ſo deliuered from the ambuſhes of the deuill,

he gaue infinite thanckes to God and to his glorious Virgin mother. And being become more couragious (though he were verie feeble by reaſon of his abſtinence and the labours which he ordinarily vndertooke, which ſo depreſſed him, that he had daily a litle fitt of an ague) his zeale of the ſaluation of ſoules, being more forcible with him, then whatſoeuer other conſideration, he ceaſſed not to preach all the whole Lent, and to ſpend all the reſt of the day in ſpirituall exerciſes, as to heare confeſsions and to giue Counſaile: but it was a worthy thing to behold the feruour and deuotion, not only of the Paduans: but alſo of the inhabitantes of the townes, borowes, villages, and caſtels there about, that in ſuch abondance flocked to his ſermons, that ſome went with light in the night to take their place in the field. The biſhopp was preſent att his preaching with all his Clergie, as alſo the principall of the Cittie; maryed women, maides and yong gentlewomen frequented them withall comlines and modeſty, and without any pompe, wherby it was eaſy to iudge with what ſpiritt they were induced to heare him. During his predication all the merchantes and artificers did ſhutt vp their ſhoppes: audience of iuſtice was omitted, and all other offices ceaſſed, ſo that it ſeemed ſome ſolemne feaſt. In the time of his ſermon the audience was ſo quiett, that ſo much as one word was not heard amongeſt thirty thouſand perſonnes there preſent: and it ſucceeded that they all retourned repleniſhed with the ſpiritt of compunction: He that could touch the ſainct or ſpeake vnto him, eſteemed himſelfe happy: and if he had not bin purposlie guarded, they would haue rent and cutt his habitt from his back and left him naked; for ſuch was the feruour of theſe people, that they ſeemed to ſee in him a true Apoſtle ſent to them by almightie God. By his meane notorious and inueterat quarrels were appeaſed; priſonners ſett att libertie; debtes quitted and forgiuen, offences and iniuries pardoned and forgotten, and mony and other thinges ſtolen or ill gott, were reſtored: Briefly what els?Effects of the preachings of S. Antony. men and women long accuſtomed to ſinne were publikelie conuerted, and did penance for their ſinnes, in ſuch ſort frequenting the ſacraments, that the Prieſtes had ſcarce time to ſerue them. The glorious ſainct hauing filled the Garner of almightie God with moſt pure corne, after he had tryed it, and burned the cockle, att the verie time that he reſided att Padua, and hauing finiſhed his three bookes of ſermons vpon the ſondayes and the Quarantine or ſermons of Lent, and the booke of the ſermons of Sondayes full of verie deep ſubtilitie and morall droctrine, which he had vndertaken and accompliſhed to ſatisfie his holineſſe and the Guardian of Hoſtie, he began to feele that God intended to call him vnto▪
                     
him, and by ſignes and miracles to demonſtrate the merittes of his moſt faithfull ſeruant, wherein the people had ſuch confidence, that whoſoeuer could haue a bitt of his habitt, held himſelfe happy, and kept it carefully as a precious holy relique.
               
               
                  Of his laſt ſicknes, his propheſie of his future glory, his viſion of God, and his death.
                  THE XXVII. CHAPTER.
                  THis lent being ended, S. Antony deſiring to repoſe himſelfe a litle, retired to S. Peters▪ fielde a place appertayning to a gentleman of Padua, called Tiſe, one that was exceedingly affected vnto him, this place was neere to the Couent of the Frere Minors, which this gentleman in manner alone mayntayned. Now it may well be imagined with what countenance he entertayned the S. doubtles as if he had bin an Angel of Paradiſe ſent vnto him by almighty God: vnderſtanding his intention, he cauſed to be made him three celles of ozier, one for himſelfe, and the other two for Brother Lucas, and Br▪ Roger his companions and familiers. He remayned not long there till he felt himſelfe aſſaulted with a great feeblenes that daily augmented, but thincking to eaſe himſelfe by trauaile, he went to the next couent of Frere Minors, where his infirmitie did oppreſſe and vtterly ouercome him. There did God reueale vnto him, that, he ſhould ſoone dye, and what glory he ſhould haue both in heauen, and on earth. Wherfore beholding and conſidering the amenity and good aire of the plaine, and ſcituation of Padua, that did neighbour the place where he was, tourning towardes his companion, he vttered theſe wordes: this plaine ſhall ſhortly be illuſtrated and honoured with great glory; as in deed it hath bin from after his death till this preſent, yea more then he foretold, in regard of the great confluence of people that haue and daily doe reſort thither to viſitt and honour his holy reliques. And doubtles, this citty may be tearmed happy and glorious, hauing in it ſuch a treaſure, that hath not enriched only it, but all the world, with ſinguler giftes and graces obtayned of God by the merittes of this glorious S. Now the S. foreſeeing that his houre drew neere, he told Br. Roger, that if in caſe he ſhould dye of that infirmity he would not be troubleſome &amp; chardgeable to the Couent where he then was: and therfore prayed him to gett him conducted to the Couent of the Virgin Mary att Padua, where the Frere Minors were; which the Religious approuing, he layd him on a wagon, to the great diſcontentment of all the Religious of that oratory: And as they conducted him to the Citty, they mett a deere

freind of his in the way, who knowing whither he way carryed, cauſed him to change his purpoſe and perſuaded him to goe to a Monaſtery out of the Citty called Arcele, alleadgeing that the viſitations he ſhould haue att Padua would be very troubleſome vnto him. Being then arriued att Arcele, and hauing there receaued all the ſacraments, God ſpeedily called him; for hauing with his Religious ſaid the ſeauen Pſalmes, and alone that worthy hymne: O glorioſa Domina, as the glorious virgin Mother had alwayes in his life bin very gracious vnto him: ſo for his comfort &amp; defence he ſaw her att his death: then a litle after he ſaw her beloued ſonne, whome very attentiuely beholding, and demaunding of Br. Roger whome he ſaw, I ſee, anſweared he, my Lord IESVS CHRIST. Wherto he added fower other wordes, for the comfort and edification of his Religious: after that he repoſed and was halfe an hower in contemplation, and then yelded his ſoule to God. He ſeemed to sleep, and preſently his fleſh, that before was vnpleaſing to behold, as well in regardThe death of S. Antony &amp; the chaung of his flesh. of his abſtinence, as his diſcipline, which had made it withered and wan, became ſo white, cleare, and bright, that it ſeemed rather his glorious, then mortall body. He died the yeare 1231. the 13. day of Iune being friday, the 36. yeare of his age, wherof he had ſpent fifteene in his Fathers houſe, two in the monaſterie of S. Vincent att Lisbone, nine att S. Croſſe of Conimbria, and about ten in the Order of S. Francis, where he liued very famous, in his life, doctrine, and miracles.
               
               
                  How he appeared to the Abbot of Vercelles.
                  THE XXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  WIthin the very houre of his departure, he ſodenly appeared in the chamber of the Abbot of Vercelles, ſometime his maſter and Gouernour, as if he had priuately entred, &amp; told him that he had left his reſidence and was retiring into his contry: which ſaid, he ſtroake him with his hand vnder the chinne, as if he would dandle him, and ſo cured him of a diſeaſe which he had there, then vaniſhed as if he had gone out att the chamber dore: but the Abbot following him, could not finde him, and enquiring of his familie if they had ſeene him, they anſweared, no. Att length ſending to his Couent, and miſsing him there, he began to vnderſtand that his contry whither he was goeing was not Portugall, but Paradis, and that he dyed att the ſame inſtant.
               
               
                  
                  Of a great mirache, wherby the death of ſainct Antony was diſcouered, and of the diſsenſion that aroſe about his ſepulture.
                  THE XXIX. CHAPTER.
                  AFter the deceaſe of S. Antony, the Religious reſolued to conceale it till they had determined how to diſpoſe of his bodie, ſo to auoyd the tumult of the people. But God did manifeſt it, by the voices of children, that went by troupes, crying throughe the Cittie: Our Father Sainct Antonie is dead▪ which induced manie Burgeſſes to goe to the monaſterie of Arcele, where they vnderſtood the truth: and hauing found him dead, they preſently placed many armed men, to guard the body, and to hinder the tranſporting therof. Then the Frere Minors of the monaſterie of Padua alſo haſtened incontinentlie thither, accompanyed with manie honorable perſonnes of the Cittie, and required the body, as appertayning vnto them, conſidering that the ſainct in his life time had declared his intention, which was, to be interred in their Couent, which they made apparant. There were alſo other Competitors: which were, they that dwelt on the other ſide of the bridge, who perceauing that the Oratorie of Arcele was not ſecure, and that there might be diſorder, endeuoured by force to take away the holy body, to carry it to a monaſterie of Religious women, neere therevnto: and the controuerſie grew to ſuch a head, that they were readie to fight, when as a third party and ſuch as were newters there preſent, laboured to accord them, with condition to expect, the comming of the miniſter Prouinciall, who ſhould determine the cauſe. Notwithſtanding, the impatient people, could not expect, but would haue the holie bodie carryed into the Cittie: and to that effect thrice aſſaulted the Monaſterie to haue the gates opened for tranſporting therof: but att each time they remayned att the gate as blinded and halfe benummed, without any power or abilitie. For which cauſe (as alſo in regard that it was feared the bodie might begin to ſauour, by reaſon of the great heate that then was) he was taken from off his diſcouered coffin, and putt in a ſquare cheſt vnder ground, which did ſo mutine the people who ſuppoſed he had bin vtterlie taken from that place, that they ran with their ſwordes in their handes, euen to the celles of the Religious, whence they would not depart till the holie bodye was ſhewen them, which appeaſed them. Four

dayes after his death, the Prouinciall arriued, who was of opinion (with whome ioyned the biſhopp) that he ſhould be interred in the ſaid Couent in the Cittie according to his owne ordonance in his life time. To this effect the Biſhop cauſed a very ſolemne proceſsion to be made, and the Gouernour of the Cittie ſent a company of foot men to guard a new bridge which he had cauſed expreslie to be made of boates: but vnderſtanding that the inhabitātes of the otherſide the bridge were reſolued by force of armes to ſurpriſe the holie body, which by right they could not challenge, and that they had alreadie broaken the bridge of boates, he proclaimed by ſound of trompett, that no man nor woman vpon paine of death ſhould ſtirre out of their lodgeing, and baniſhed from that contrie and territory, the principall heades of this conſpiracie, and by this meane freed all the Religious of both ſex in Padua from feare; for they were extremelie afflicted, and accuſed themſelues, imputing the ſame to arriue for their offences: wherfore they beſought our Lord IESVS CHRIST, to deliuer them from this affliction, which alſo had put the whole citty into a great tumult. So the glorious body of S. Antony was tranſported to the ſaid Couent of Padua, where it was interred in a ſepulcher newly and miraculously diſcouered, the fift day after his death.
               
               
                  Of the reſolution of his canonization, and of certaine miracles there wrought.
                  THE XXX. CHAPTER.
                  TO ſpeake the truth the diſſention aforeſaid was not without cauſe, conſidering that they conteſted about ſo precious a treaſure: it is alſo to be conſidered how iuſtly the Paduans poſſeſſed this holy body, ſith they hazarded their life for it, before it wrought any miracles; as if each of them had bin aſſured of the great number of miracles which God would worck by it, as he began that verie day, making this pacification to appeare ſo much more pleaſing, and this treaſure more deere and gratefull, as the contention had bin greiuous, by meanes of the recouerie of all the diſeaſed that onlie touched his ſepulcher, yea of thoſe that, vnable to come to his ſepulcher, or into the Church, inuocated his holy name without. This ſo notable and inexpected ſucceſſe, ſpreading incontinentlie ouer all the neighbour places, the Biſhop of Padua vnable to retaine thedeuotiō of the people, that publikely honoured him according to his merittes; he ſent embaſſadours to Rome in his

name and the Paduans, to beſeech the Pope to canoniſe this S. which God had beſtowed on them. They being graciously entertayned and heard, together with the examen made by order of the ſaid Biſhop, and an other by the deputies of his holineſſe, who were an Abbot of S. Benedict, and a Dominican Prior, vpon the life, conuerſations, and miracles of the S. and finding more then ſufficient proofe, he propoſed to the Conſiſtory his canonization att Spoletum, it being not full, but neereA Cardinal oppoſing againſt the canonization of the S. God inſpired him to change his opinion. a yeare after his death. Wherto there directly oppoſed himſelfe a Cardinall, which cauſed further proceeding to be deferred, till the day following, but the firſt night after, the Cardinall had this dreame: It ſeemed vnto him that his holineſſe would conſecrate an Altare, and to that end demaunded holy reliques of him. But he not knowing what to giue him, heard a voice that ſaid: Giue him of the new reliques of S. Antony. Wherevpon, this Cardinall awakinge, ſollicited the Pope more then any other, to haſten the canonization of the S. as hauing bin by this diuine voice, fully aſſured of his great merittes. Beſides the approbation of the vnder written miracles wrought after his death, nor including thoſe wrought in his life time, he cured nineteene that were lame, fiue of the palſie, fiue that were crooked, ſix blinde, three deafe, three mute, two of the gout: he raiſed two to life, and cured diuers others of ſundry diſeaſes. For which cauſe, the yeare 1232. on the day of Penticoſt he was enrolled by the Pope in the Catalogue of Sainctes, with great ſolemnitie. The ſaid Pope compoſed and ſung that worthy antheme: O Doctor optime; and ordayned it to be ſung in all churches theAll the belles of Lisbone did ring of themſelues. day of his feaſt, which was conſtitued to be yearly the thirteenth of Iune. One the day of his canonization all the belles of his cittie of Lisbone did ring of themſelues, to the exceeding contentment of all perſonnes, wherof they knew no cauſe, but that they felt an ineſtimable ioy in their hartes: but they vnderſtood afterward that their contryman and fellow-cittizen S. Antony, had bin that day canonized.
                  
                     The bulle of the aforeſaid canonization, taken out of the tenth chapter of the ſixt booke, and heere more properly placed.
                     GRegory biſhop, ſeruant of the ſeruantes of God, to our venerable Brethren, Archbiſhops, Biſhoppes, health and Apoſtolicall benediction. As God ſaith by the Prophett: I will make you honoured and prayſed of all people; and by the ſage, he promiſeth that the iuſt ſhall ſhine in the preſence of God, as the ſunne; ſo it ſeemeth vnto vs expedient that we alſo here on earth below, doe prayſe the ſainctes which his diuine Maieſtie hath crouned in heauen; and conſidering withall, that God is knowne and adored principally in them,

who is praiſeworthy and glorious in his Sainctes, and that miraculously to manifeſt his omnipotencie, and his mercy towardes our ſaluation, he euen ennobleth here below by miracles, his faithfull ſeruantes, with whome he hath concurred to the meritt of eternall glory, and this, to confound the obſtinacie of many heretikes, and to confirme his church in his holy Catholique, Apoſtolike and Romane faith, and to expell out of lukewarme hartes, all sloath and negligence, awakening them to good worckes, by theſe holy examples, and that the hartes of heretikes might be made plyable to belieue by effect, what they ſeeme not to vnderſtand by the holy ſcriptures; and finally, that all Iewes and Pagans, the vaile of blindnes being taken from before their eyes, may ſee this tranſparent light of the omnipotencie of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, and that they may not alleadge for excuſe, that they had no occaſion deſeruing their conuerſion vnto him, and their acknowledgement of him for true God and true man. Wherfore my beloued, we yeld thanckes to this bountifull giuer of all goodnes, if not as we ought, at leaſt as we may, for that it hath pleaſed him, for confirmation of our holy faith, and the confuſion of heretikes, to beſtow on vs, holy and famous men in theſe dayes, who by ſignes and manifeſt miracles haue declared, how true, ineſtimable and indubitable is the faith of the holy Romane Church, ſith they who dye therein, ſo dye in the grace of God, that they glitter, twinckle and ſhine in the world, as Sunnes in the firmament. Therfore being therein but one faith, and the ſame, by this diuine and manifeſt approbation appearing moſt true, the falſhood of all others muſt be very euident. Of the nomber of thoſe that haue meritted to worck miracles, before and after their death, is the bleſſed Father S. Antony, of the Order of the Frere Minors, who liuing in this world, was very famous for his great merittes, and liuing now in heauen, he ſhineth by many miracles which are ordinarily wrought att his ſepulcher, wherof we are aſſured, as well by very authenticall worthy actes, as by reuelation of perſonnes worthy of creditt: Theſe two thinges, merittes and miracles, ſuffice to giue teſtimony among men of the ſanctity of a man, yea they ſuffice to make vs yeld to honour and inuocate them, as our interceſſors vnto God, which two thinges, are taken out of this text of the Goſpell: They goeing forth preached euery where: our lord worcking

Benett, and to Br. Iohn, Priour of S Auguſtins, in the monaſtery of the Iacobins of Padua, that they ſhould make an exact examen, and approued catalogue of the miracles of the ſaid Sainct, which we hauing ſeene to be conformable to that which by our owne

experience we know to be very true touching his life and holy conuerſatiō: that it may not ſeeme we would hinder or depriue him of his praiſe, being therevnto vrged by the ſaid Biſhop of Padua, and the reuerence of the ſeruantes of God, which ſo notoriously deſerue the ſame: and by the aduiſe of our venerable Brethren, the Cardinalls of the holy Roman Church, and of all the Prelates att this preſent neere vnto vs: we haue enrolled him in the Catalogue of the SS. Wherfore the candell not being ſett on the candleſticke but to giue light, we pray and commaund all thoſe to whome the knowledge of theſe preſents ſhall come that in vertue of this Apoſtolicall Breuie they induce their ſubiectes, and procure them ſolemnly and reuerentlie to keepe and honour his feaſt, which is the thirteenth of Iune, to the end that God being moued and appeaſed by his holie prayers, doe giue vs his holie grace in this life, and his glorie in the other. Beſides, that the ſepulcher of this worthie Confeſſour, who by the ſplendour of his miracles beautifieth our holie Church, be, with the honour due vnto it viſited and frequented; we truſting in the diuine grace, and in the aucthoritie of the glorious Apoſtles ſainct Peter and ſainct Paul; we mercifullie remitte and releaſe a yeares penance enioyned them, to all thoſe that truelie confeſſed and penitent, doe on the day of his feaſt, and all the octaue of euerie yeare, viſitt the ſame.

                  THE XXXI. CHAPTER.
                  POpe Alexander the fourth, deſiring to deliuer manie Citties of Lombardie, from the cruelty of the Tyran Ezelin, that had vſurped almoſt all the Venetian territorie, he ſent to Veniſe as his Legat Philip de Fontaine, Biſhop of Rauenna, that hauing ouerthrowne a mightie and potent armie, he might aſsige Padua, where the Tyran had placed a nephew of his, as lieutenant to guard that place faithfullie for him. God determining to end and ceaſe the tyrannie of this cruell Prince, and to deliuer that Cittie by the merittes of ſainct Antony, the night of his feaſt. The cittie being in this trouble, the Guardian of the Couent of the Frere Minors, called Brother Bartholomew Corradin, watching att the ſepulcher of the Sainct in feruent prayers and teares praying for the deliuery of that cittie, he heard a cleare voice that ſeemed to proceed out of the

ſaid ſepulcher which ſaid vnto him: Brother Bartholomew, feare no more, but be comforted and giue thanckes to God: for I promiſe and aſſure thee, that on my octaue day, this citty ſhalbe reſtored to her former liberty; which came to paſſe: for Anſelmus the Gouernour therof, being terrified by the hand of God, went out and fled with all his people, in ſuch ſort that the ſaid Apoſtolicall Legat entred in, and reſtored all thinges to their former ſplendour, liberty and freedome. The ſaid voice was not onlie heard by the ſaid Guardian: but alſo by many Religious of the Couent that watched in the ſaid Church, who gaue teſtimony therof afterward. Wherfore the Paduans ordayned that thenceforward the ſaid octaue day ſhould be ſolemniſed, as the day it ſelfe of the feaſt of ſainct Antony, in acknowledgement of that ſinguler benefitt. Afterward they tooke him for a ſinguler aduocate of their cittie, conſecrating vnto him the altare of their great church, wherein they placed his reliques, and there they celebrated his feaſt, on which day manie worthy miracles were wrought. Padua being thus deliuered, the yeare 1259. the Paduans began to build a great and ſumptuous Church, wherinto were tranſported his holie reliques the yeare, 1273. the eue of Quaſi modo, the Cardinall of Bolonia named Guy Charles Biſhop of Portuenſis, legat of his holineſſe, with many ceremonies ſolemniſed the ſaid translation. This Cardinall hauing bin deliuered from death by ſainct Antony, was exceeding deuout vnto him, and therfore offered vnto him a faire and rich ſhrine or reliquarie of ſiluer, wherin he putt his holie head. Sainct Bonauenture Generall of the Order, was preſent att his translation, and opened the ſhrine, wherin the glorious bodie of the Sainct had bin thirtie yeares, which he found all tourned to aſhes ſauing the tongue which was verie freſh and vermillion as when it had life, which taking in his handes, in preſence of all the companie with aboundance of teares he vttered theſe wordes: O bleſſed tongue which haſt alwayes prayſed they God, and haſt laboured others to doe the like, it verie euidentlie appeareth that thou haſt highlie merited before God! then kiſsing it verie tenderlie, he put it againe verie reuerentlie into the ſaid reliquarie. On a certaine time after, a Generall deſired to tranſport this holie tongue from that place; but hauing taken it vp, and thincking to carry it away, he could neuer finde the dore where to goe forth, norA miracle of the tongue of S. Antony. had he power to carrie it back whence he had taken it; wherfore he ſecretlie hid it in an altare, none perceauing the ſame, where it remayned manie yeares after, till it pleaſed the Sainct to diſcouer it, ſo that, taking it thence, it was put in a ve

                  How he raiſed his Nephew that died att Lisbone.
                  THE XXXII. CHAPTER.
                  ANephew of the ſainctes the sōne of his ſiſter, called Paris, played one day att Lisbone, on the ſea ſhoare, with many children his companions, all which entred into a ſhallop, which for their recreation they lanched into the ſea; but there ſodēly aroſe a ſtorme, which rayſing the ſea waues, preſently ouer-whelmed the ſhalop: all that were therin ſaued themſelues by ſwiming except Paris, who being the yongeſt, could not ſwimme, but was drowned; which his Father vnderſtanding, he prayed the Fiſhers to ſearch for recouery of his body, to giue it Chriſtian buryall. They more to ſatisfie him, then in hope to finde him, ſought him ſometime, and att length God permitted them to finde him, and deliuering him to his Father, the kinred were of opinion to haue him buryed: but his pittyfull mother, the ſiſter of S. Antony, hauing good hope of the life of her ſonne by the merittes of her brother, would not permitt him to be buryed, and therfore would be continually neere him all the day following and the night after; but the next morning the kinred purpoſing not to permitt the body any longer vnburyed, becauſe it already exceedingly ſauoured, the mother reſolutely ſaid and auowed, that if they would bury her child, they ſhould bury her aliue together with it. Then ſhe made this prayer to S. Antony: O my glorious Brother, if charity moue thee as I belieue it doeth, and if thou be ſo carefull and ready to gratifie them that inuocate thee, yea ſuch as are ſtrangers, I beſeech thee to haue compaſsion of thy ſiſter, and of thy Nephew, who if thou pleaſe to reſtore him life, ſhall ſerue God in thy Order, whē he ſhall attaine to age conuenient &amp; competent to that end, if ſo it pleaſe the diuine Maieſtie. The ſucceſſe was admirable, for as ſoone as ſhe had ended her vow, the child that had bin three dayes dead, aroſe before all the company, and hauing attained age ſufficient, he accompliſhed the ſaid vow, taking the habit of the Order of his vncle, wherein he piously perſeuered.
               
               
                  Of two other raiſed from death by Sainct Antonie, and of ſome others.
                  THE XXXII. CHAPTER.
                  A Queene of Leon in Spaine borne in Portugall, hauing by accident of ſicknes loſt her daughter of eleuen yeares of age, and hauing

heard this foreſaid miracle recounted, would not haue her daughter buryed, but kept her three dayes without buryall; during which time ſheA princeſse was raiſed by the merits of S. Antony. deuoutly inuocated the helpeof S. Antony, with a feruent faith, for which ſhe deſerued att length to be heard: but the child her daughter being rayſed ſayd vnto her: deere Mother, I beſeech God to pardon you for hauing troubled me in the celeſtiall glory, where I was amongeſt the virgins, though it be not for long time: for I am reſtored to life att the inſtance of S. Antony but for fifteene dayes: which ſo ſucceeded, for fifteene dayes after, ſhe dyed againe.
                  A gentleman that could haue no children, vowed to the S. that if he would obtaine him one, he would euery yeare viſitt his ſepulcher, and he was heard; but goeing one day to accompliſh his vow he left his ſonne of ſeauen yeares old ſick in his houſe, who by litle and litle ſo recouered health that he went to play with his companions, in a chanell where then there was no water, it being bended an other way to water a certaine plaine, but the banke or bay being not ſtrong enough, gaue ſuch way to the violence of the water, that it retourned impetuouslie into the chanell, where it drowned nine children playing there, wherof two being found were preſentlie buryed. The ſaid gentleman retourning from Padua, of his firſt friendes that he mett, he demaunded how his ſonne did: they vnwilling to deliuer him ſuch vnwelcome newes, anſweared, they thought he was well, becauſe it was not long ſince he played therby with his companions. This poore father paſſed farther, and came to his houſe, where he asked for his ſonne. His ſeruantes ſeemed not to heare him, and endeauoured to diuert him from ſuch demaund: but he ſaid, he would neither eat nor drinck till he had ſeene him. Which conſtrayned them to declare vnto him the infortunate diſaſter of his ſonne; which hauing vnderſtood he became out of himſelfe; but afterwardes by litle and litle recouering his ſpirittes, he ſwoare and very obſtinately proteſted, that he would neither eat nor drinck till ſainct Antony had reſtored him his ſonne, which with a very feruent faith expecting, a litle after his ſonne entred in where he was with other nine of his companions, that by the merittes of ſainct Antony had bin ſaued with him, for which they prayſed God in his ſainct and glorified him with hart and voice. It is found to be recorded that the two other children companions of the foreſaid, which were already buryed, were alſo rayſed by the merittes of the S. who had compaſsion of the clamours that their parentes made vnto him.
                  In Apulia, in the citty of Monoplia, a child did ſo vndermine a pitt, neerevnto the Frere Minors, that the earth hauing no ſupport brake downe

vpon him, where he was buryed, without appearance of any reliefe▪ His mother vnderſtāding therof, ran inſtantly to the monaſtery of Frere Minors, crying and often reiterating theſe wordes: O S. Antony, reſtore me my child. In meane while they were buſy in taking vp the earth frō the pitt, wherein they found the childe aliue, though much troubled, who was asked how it was poſsible that ſo much earth had not choakedAn other couered in earth. him? He anſweared, that S. Antony had ſtill held his hand▪ vnder his throat, to giue him meanes to breath: which gaue all thoſe preſent occaſion to praiſe and thanck God in his ſainct.
               
               
                  Of many miracles wrought againſt ſuch as▪ would not beleeue the glory of the Sainct.
                  THE XXXIV. CHAPTER.
                  A Chaplain belonging to the Biſhop of Padua, hearing the firſt miracles of S. Antony related, would not only not belieue them, but euen did ieſt and ſcoffe att them. But he preſently felt the diuine reuenge; for he was ſtriken with an extreme ſharpA Chaplain incredulous of the miracles of the S. hauing recourſe vnto him in a mortall infirmities, was heard. and peſtilencious feauer, which did ſo enfeeble him and brought him to that extremitie, that he was in danger of death. Wherupon acknowledging his offence and repenting, the third day of his ſickneſſe, he called his mother, to whome he confeſſed his fault, and proteſted he was exceedinglie grieued therat; then he prayed her to goe to the ſepulcher of the S. there to ſeeke to obtaine mercie, and in his name to promiſe, that thenceforward in ſteed of incredulity and diriſion, he would firmelie beleeue, publikely preach, and manifeſt the glorie of this miracle to all the world. It was admirable to conſider, the mother goeing thither, ſhe inuocated the Sainct, then made the vow: and in that very inſtant the ſick party was cured; leaping out of his bed to the great admiration of all that were preſent.
                  A certaine old gentleman that had bin an heretike from his infancie, ſetting one day att table, heard many miracles recounted of ſainctA gentleman proued a miracle by caſting a glaſſe againſt the

                        . Antony, whereatt gibing and reputing all fabulous, he tooke a drincking glaſſe of cryſtall, and threw it out att the windoe, ſaying: If ſainct Antonie can preſerue▪ that glaſſe from breaking, I will henceforward hold him for a ſainct▪ and the glaſſe being very forciblie caſt againſt the ſtones, was miraculouslie preſerued entier. This heretike ſeeing ſo manifeſt a miracle, was moued, not onlie to▪ belieue that Sainct Antonie was truelie and reallie a Sainct, but was alſo induced to forſake his her

                     ſie, and abiuring it ſincerelie▪
                     
to embrace our faith▪ which he performed.
                  Diuers perſons eating att table, fell into diſcourſe of the miracles of the ſainct, and after many relations, one of them recounted that of the glaſſe aforeſaid, exceedinglie admiring and wondring therat; an other of them that was a companion and ſcoffer doubting of this miracle,An other ſeeing withered vignebranches to beare grapes in an inſtāt and to yeld wine ſaw withered branches of a vigne, wherof he tooke a handfull and in the other hand a glaſſe, ſaying: If Sainct Antony would make grapes to grow out of theſe branches, and that their iuyce and liquor would fill this glaſſe, I would hold it a miracle, and then would I beeleue the former miracle you recounted: Which he had no ſooner ſpoaken, but all the ſprigges of the branches which this ſcoffing fellow held, budded forth leaues, and then very faire grapes, which being cruſhed together filled the glaſſe with liquor, and by this meane the vertue of S. Antony was acknowledged and confeſſed by thoſe that formerlie derided him.
                  Sainct Antonie was become famous and reuerenced att Padua, for the miracles by him there ordinarilie▪ wrought, wheratt neuertheleſſe ſome heretiques did ordinarilie ſcoffe and gibe, and one time they purpoſed publikelie to deride them, and to that end preſented themſelues att the Church dedicated to the ſainct: and being before the ſepulcher, they began to cry and lament, ſaying that one of them (who had a hand kirchefe before his eyes, which they had embrued with bloud, that it might be thought his eyes were thruſt out, according to their crye) had in a quarrell vnfortunately loſt both his eyes, and therfore they exhorted the people to pray for this wretched blind man, who of his owne part omitted not to pray to God, and fayned to inuocate the ſainct cunninglie playing the hypocrite. Now after they had ſpent about an houre vpon this ſubiect, the blinde fellow purpoſed to take off his handkirchefe, to make a ſhew firſt that he was cured, as he cryed and proteſted; that by this fact he might afterwardes inferre, that as often as any miraclesAn other iestingly faining to be blind was blīd in deed. were wrought by ſainct Antony, they were ſuppoſed and ſuborned as that was. But they were much amazed when they ſaw the two prunelles out of the Impoſters eyes, when as they determined and thought to deride the ſainct, and therfore changing their laughter into teares, and their quibbes and ſcoffes into prayers, they with ſuch a faith humbled themſelues, that att length they obtayned the recouerie of their impoſters ſight.
                  An hereticall ſoldier meeting a poore leaper, that went to the ſepulcher of ſainct Antony to be cured, ſayd vnto him: Friend thou looſeſt they labour and time, for I aſſure thee, if ſainct Antony euer cure thee of thy leaproſie, I am content to haue it. The poore Leaper yet omitted not to proceeded in his iorney, and being att the ſepulcher of

                     A ſoldier had the leproſy of a leper, as he deſired diſsuading him from goeing to the ſepulcher of S. Antony. S. Antony he fell a sleepe. The S. appeared vnto him in a dreame and ſayd: goe and carry thy clappers to the ſoldier that thou metteſt in the way for he hath thy leproiſe as he ſaid, and bid him vſe them. So being awaked, and finding himſelfe perfectly cured he caried his clapper by commandement of the S. to the ſoldier, whome he found full of leproſie from the head to the foot: for which he very hitterly lamented, and repēting what he had done vowing and recommending himſelfe to the S. he deſerued to be heard, hauing learned by experience, how great is the vertue of the Sainctes of God.
               
               
                  Of many other miracles, and of the Breefe of S. Antony againſt the Deuils, which remained in the handes of the king of Portugall.
                  THE XXXV. CHAPTER.
                  
                     A ſoldier by the merits of S. Antony being cured of a deadly hurt thincking to be reuenged had his wond againe. Vowes muſt be accomplished. One deaf and dūme cured by the ſaid S. IN a combatt that happened betweene two ſoldiers, one of them was ſo ſtrangely hurt in one arme, that ſpeaking humanely it was incurable, att leaſt, ſauing his life, he could not auoyd a perpetuall mayne. Now recommending himſelfe to S. Antony he was preſently cured, the wound being ſo cloſed, it as if he had neuer bin hurt. But as is ſaid of the wicked, hauing paſt and eſcaped the danger they ſcoffe att the S. ſo the ſoldier began to conſider by what meanes he might be reuenged, and diuers times diſcourſing therof with himſelfe, the night before this lewd deſigne, the ſaid wound came into his arme as before: the S. teaching him and all others, that the graces and fauours of God are not to be abuſed againſt his ſeruice, that is, employed in any thing which he forbiddeth, and is not pleaſing vnto him, as to the detriment of ones neighbour.
                  A child of Padua called Henry, hauing a ſwelling in his neck, vowed to the S. and was immediatly cured: but his mother that cauſed him to vow not regarding to fulfill it, the infirmity retourned, yet repenting and accompliſhing the vow, her ſonne was cured againe.
                  An Abbot hauing great compaſsion of his ſeruant, that was deafe &amp; dumme, vowed in his behalfe to S. Antony, that if he would pleaſe to cure him, he would employ him all his life in the ſeruice of his Church; he was inſtantly cured, for which he was not vngratefull: for he employed him in his church all the dayes of his life in the Citty of Sautaren in the kingdome of Portugall, in the raigne of Don Donis.
                  There was a poore woman, who though ſhe were very deuout to S. Antony, yet being ſinfull, the deuill ſometimes poſeſſed her and tempted her to deſtroy her ſelfe, perſuading her that ſhe could neuer ſatisfie God, for the many ſinnes ſhe had cōmitted but by voluntary killing her ſelfe;

to this falſe imagination, he added a falſe viſion; for the deuill appeared vnto her in forme of a crucifix, telling her that for the loue ſhe boare him he would ſaue her, but ſhe could hardly ſatisfie for her ſinnes vnleſſe ſhe would voluntary murder her ſelfe; to which purpoſe he coūſailed her to goe that very houre to the riuer Tage, and there to drowne her ſelfe, and promiſed her to receaue her att the inſtant into his glory. This woman hauing had this viſion, concealed it ſometime in her hart; now it happened, that when her husband excedingly checked and rebuked her, amōg other iniuries calling her poſſeſſed with a deuill; ſhe partly in fury, and diſpaire procured her by her husband, and partly vrged by the deuill by remembrance of the ſaid viſion, reſolued to drowne her ſelfe, and with that intention departed from her houſe; but S. Antony would not permitt ſuch an act, ſo vnworthy of a Chriſtian to be perpetrated, eſpecially on ſuch a day, it being on the celebration of his feaſt: for this miſerable woman paſsing before his Church, was inſpired to enter into it:S. Antony hindered a woman from drownīg▪ her ſelfe. which ſhe did, and thē very deuoutly prayed the S. that he would voutſafe to reueale vnto her, if it were poſsible, whither it were the will of God ſhe ſhould drowne her ſelfe or not: hauing ended her prayer, ſhe ſlept a ſweet sleep and ſo light, that ſhe heard the voice of the Sainct which in her dreame ſaid vnto her: looke vpon thy boſome and when thou haſt read the writing thou findeſt there, thou ſhalt be cured. The woman preſently awaking found on her boſome a bitt of parchment, wherin was written in letters of Gold: Ecce crucem Domini, fugite partes diuerſae; vicit leo, de tribu Iuda: Alleluia, Alleluia: As ſoone as ſhe had read the ſame, ſhe was entierlie freed of her temptation.
                  The king of Portugall Don Donis, hauing bin aduertiſed of this great miracle, by the husband of the woman, demaunded the ſaid Breefe or writing, which was giuen him: but it was ſtrange, this woman not hauing her writing, the deuill began preſently to vex her: but hauing no meanes to demaund it againe of the king, who had put it amongſt his reliques (hauing wrought many miracles by this breefe) the husband was aduiſed to requeſt a copy therof, which by meane of ſome Religious, he obtained, which hauing deliuered to his wife, ſhe was all the reſt of her dayes freed from the ſaid temptation, liuing ſecurely the ſpace of twenty yeares.
                  
                     How he deliuered from death the Princeſſe of Portugall. Taken out of the ſixteenth chapter of the tenth booke, to be more properly put in this place.
                     THe princeſſe, Lady Aldoucia daughter of the king of Portugall and of queene Tereſa, by a very extreme and dangerous infirmity

that tormented her, approaching to her death, her mother had recourſe vnto ſainct Antony, to whome ſhe was much deuoted, moſt affectionately recommending her daughter vnto him, and praying him to remember that he was borne in that kingdome, and that as he had cured, ſaued, and rayſed ſo many in Italy, he would pleaſe alſo to deliuer her daughter from that danger of death. Att that very inſtant, ſo ſtrong and violent a fitt of the feauer did aſſault the ſick Princeſſe, that euery one eſteemed it her laſt agony. But then did the Sainct appeare vnto her, and ſaid: daughter, God hath ſent me to thee for ſatisfaction of the frequent prayers of thy mother, to putt it to the election of thy will, either to goe now with me to Paradiſe, or for conſolation of thy mother to continue longer in the world. The Princeſſe hauing choaſen the ſecond; ſainct Antony deliuered her his girdle ſaying: Well, kiſſe this Cord: which ſhe taking in her handes, and as ſhe thought holding it faſt, ſhe cryed to her mother, Madame, Madame, come ſee the glorious ſainct Antony whome I hold by his girdle, which he hath deliuered me to kiſſe therby to be cured: ſhe comming and not ſeeing the Sainct att all, found her daughter perfectly well; wherfore ſhe diuulged this miracle in the Citty of Allenquor, where this happened, in the Church of the Frere Minors, whither ſhe with all her Court repayred to giue thanckes to God and to his holy ſeruant.

                  A Poore man being ſeduced by an Inchaunter, that promiſed to procure him an inſtinct to know what ſoeuer he deſired, entred with him into a circle where in an inſtāt he ſaw appeare a great number of deuils, who perceauing him to be vtterly amazed and terrified, did rent out his eyes and tongue, and then vaniſhed. This miſerable fellow haſtened directly to the Church of S. Antony, where repentingA blind man had his ſight and ſpech reſtored by the meritts of the S. to haue conſented to the Magician, he inuocated with his hart, not hauing the vſe of his voice, his aſsiſtance. And vpon theſe his humble prayers, in the time of high maſſe, as the Preiſt ſung. Gloria in excelſis, Benedictus qui venit in n

                        une Domini, his two eyes were miraculously reſtored him, which being knowne, all the Citty of Padua was full of the bruit, each one deſiring to ſee him. Many of the more ancient and noble of the citty held it conuenient, that all the people there preſent ſhould ioyne themſelues in prayer that it might pleaſe God to accompany this firſt miracle with a ſecond, in reſtoring his ſpeech: To this effect

they all fell on their knees &amp; offered their prayers, the Maſſe alwayes cō
                     tinuying: when the Agnus Dei was ſung, his tongue was alſo reſtored, wherby he began with a loud voice to prayſe God and his S.
                  
                     A Religious vnable to ſupport the paines of purgatorie which she had deſired obtayned by the S. to be freed of them. A Religious woman of the Order of ſainct Clare, hauing heard preached the rigour of the paines of Purgatory, conceaued ſuch a terrour of goeing thither, that ſhe prayed almighty God to graunt her to ſuffer her Pugatory in this world, and ſo long continued in prayer that att length God heard her. But being vnable any long time to ſupport, ſo rigorous and inſupportable tormentes, ſhe diſcouered the cauſe of her afflictions to the other Religious, whome ſhe prayed to make ſupplication to God by the merittes of ſainct Antony, that he would pleaſe to moderate thoſe ſo bitter tormentes which ſhe endured: and ſo all the Religious with ſuch deuotion and humility applyed themſelues to prayer, that by the merittes of S. Antony ſhe was eaſed therof, &amp; thenceforward ſhe was no more ſo raſh as to tempt God; but entierly reſigned herſelfe to the will of his diuine maieſty, caſting herſelfe abſolutely into his diſpoſition.
                  The Religious Br. Bernardine of Parma, by a violent catarre in his throat became dumme, for cure wherof were applyed all about his neck burning cauters, all which nothing auayled: ſo that he became ſo feeble that putting to him a litle waxe candle lighted, he could not with his breath blow it out: wherfore his death and ſtifling being feared, he was carryed to Padua, where the feaſt of S. Antony was celebrated, to viſitt his ſepulcher. There was then a great concourſe of people, where in publike preſence he offered his prayer, ſhedding abondance of teares: then he began to ſpett and to auoyd ſuch a quantity of filthy and loathſome matter, that the beholders could no longer endure it, their hartes ſo arriſing att the ſight of ſuch inſupportable ſtuffe: and withall he was cured▪ of the catarre and recouered his ſpeech, for which he hartely prayſed God and his ſainct.
                  
                     And a child was raiſed frō death. The ſonne of a poore woman about twēty monthes old called Thomaſin, dwelling neere the ſaid Church, fell one day vnaduiſedly into a pond full of water with his head downeward, and was carryed home dead. His mother full of deſolation, haſtened with great faith to the ſepulcher of the ſainct, before which ſhe fell on her knees, beſeeching him with all her ſoule to reſtore her child to life: and promiſing euery yeare, though ſhe were needy, to giue an almoſe to the poore in his honour, of the quantity of her ſonnes weight in wheat: who was ſpeedily reſtored to life to the exceeding amazement of all that were preſent, who together with the mother gaue thanckes to God for the ſame.
                  Theſe miracles of S. Antony are approued to be very authenticall,

                  Of the conuerſion of Br. Bernard Quintauall, and of his pouerty.
                  THE FIRST CHAPTER.
                  
                     BROTHER Bernard Quintauall, was borne att Aſsiſium, of the moſt noble family therin, where hauing conſidered the ſtrangenes of life of S. Francis, his admirable contempt of worldly commodities, his vnchangeable aſſurance, his inuincible conſtancie in ſupporting iniuryes, and his exceeding patiēce, in enduring the troubles and laboures of this life, yea ſeeming dailie more and more to conceaue greater contentment therin; He eſteemed all this could not proceed but by the will of God: which he experienced, as hath bin amplie declared in the eight chapter of the firſt booke and firſt volume, where

his conuerſion is related att lardge. Hauing then renounced the world, and ſold all he had in the marckett place of Aſsiſium, and giuen the price to the poore and beggers of IESVS CHRIST, following S. Francis, he deſerued to be his eldeſt child, as well in time as perfection; for by ſpeciall priuiledge he had the grace to be a true louer of pouerty. And alſo S. Francis ſometimes would ſay, that Br. Bernard had founded his Order, ſelling his ſubſtance to giue to the poore, euen to his very apparell wherwith he was cloathed, ſo that his firſt Religious habitt was made of almoſe: then being thus naked, he offered and caſt himſelfe into the armes of IESVS CHRIST crucified naked, whome he imitated euen to his death. God alſo by a particuler prerogatiue beſtowed on him, a ioyfull patience which merueillously ſhined in him, and particulerlie in thoſe iornyes he performed vpon obedience, edifying his neigbour, and exerciſing himſelfe in vertues.
               
               
                  How Br. Bernard by the vertue of patience built a monastery att Bolonia, and ſome others in Lombardy.
                  THE II. CHAPTER.
                  AFter the firſt confirmation of the Order by Pope Innocent the third, and hauing receaued the precept of penitence, Brother Bernard was ſent by ſainct Francis to Bolonia, to edifie the people with examples of piety. Being in that Citty, the Children ſeeing him in ſo ſimple a habitt and ſo different from other Religious, they followed him in the ſtreetes, crying after him, reproaching him, reuiling him, and vſing him as a foole: which he endured with immoueable patience and contentment; yea to procure himſelfe the greateſt diſgrace and diſhonour for the loue of IESVS CHRIST, who was ſo much contemnedPatience of Br. Bernard. for vs, he would frequent thoſe places where was the greateſt recourſe of people, and there the idle and loytering companious ſcoffed att him, and flouted him as a foole. But the patient and obediente ſeruant of God, did neither reſiſt nor complaine, but ſhewed a pleaſing and ioyfull contenance, contenting himſelfe for his food with a bitt of bread giuen him for the loue of God, and thus he continued for certaine dayes, till it pleaſed our Lord, to declare him to be his ſeruāt, which by this meanes came to paſſe. One of the nobleſt of the Citty who then was the Iudge, ſeeing and conſidering the life of this poore Religious, ſayed in himſelfe, this man thus contemned, muſt needes be ſome holy perſonnage in regard of his extraordinary patience. And therfore he called him vnto him, and hauing demaunded what he was, and whence he came, Brother Bernard drew out of his boſome the

Euangelicall rule which ſainct Francis had giuen him, and which he had written no leſſe in his hart then in that paper: and without vſing any other wordes deliuered it vnto him. The iudge hauing ſeene the ſame, was ſtricken into an amazement, and tourning towardes many that were flocked thither to heare the Religious diſcourſe: he ſayd: This rule doubtleſſe teacheth the moſt ſtrict and rigorous religious life that is in the Church; and in deed this man and all his companions that lead this life, repreſent vnto vs the Apoſtolicall Colledge, and therfore are worthy of very great honour. This being ſaid, he conducted Brother Bernard to his houſe, with ſuch ioy and contentment as if he had bin an Angell of heauen. A litle after, att his owne expences he built for him and his companions, a Couent without the cittie but very neere the walles as moſt commodious for them. He liued and dyed as a deuout Brother of the Order. In this ſort was Brother Bernard the firſt that began the Couent att Bolonia, which he did not ſeeke to build ſumptuouslle and found with much rentes and poſſeſsions, but with the examples of a moſt profound humility and patience; he built vpon the firme rocke of IESVS CHRIST, who is our true and liuely foundation. Br. Bernard being then thus ſeated att Bolonia, the people by litle and litle knowing his ſanctity, beganne to reſpect him and deſirouslie to heare his wordes, and to admitt his Coū
                     ſailes, in ſuch ſort that in a ſhort ſpace, many did not only forſake their diſordered life, but alſo left the world, becomming Frere Minors in the ſaid monaſtery. To be ſhort, he was generally reſpected of all as a ſainct, each one deſired to ſee him, and to kiſſe that habitt which formerlie they miſpriſed; but he, as the true and humble diſciple of Euangelicall humilitie, ſhunning theſe vaine honours, retourned to the holie Father ſainct Francis, whome he beſought to ſend him ſome other where: wherin the ſainct was willing to gratifie him, and ſent him into Lombardie, where he edified the people with admirable vertue, and erected many monaſteries, and recouered an infinite: nomber of ſoules that reſolued to follow the life and profeſsion of the: goſpell of IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  Of the pilgrimage of Brother Bernard to S. Iames in Galicia, and what happened to him there.
                  THE III. CHAPTER.
                  WHen the holy Father S. Francis went into Spaine to viſitt the Church of ſainct Iames in Galicia, he tooke Br. Bernard and certaine other of his companions with him. They

found in theiriorney a poore ſicke perſonne in a place very miſerable and diſcomfortable, and vttetly abandoned; there they remayned certaine dayes to haue care of him, ſerue and comfort him. But ſainct Francis knowing his ſickneſſe would be of long continuance, lefte Brother Bernard to attend him, and proceeded on his pilgrimage, whence retourning he found the ſick man recouered, and tooke Brother Bernard back with him into Italie, whence ſhortlie after he demaunded leaue of him to viſite the Apoſtle Sainct Iames in Galicia, not hauing opportunitie to goe with him the other time; and hauing accompliſhed his iuſt deſire, att his retourne he came to a riuer which, by reaſon of the ſwiftnes and violence of the current which was very deepe, he could not wade ouer, wherfore he was enforced to ſtay att the ſide therof, where a litle after, an Angel in very actiue manner appeared vnto him, and ſaluted him in Italian: Which Brother Bernard admiring, asked him if he came from Italie, or whence he was: wherto he anſweared, that he came from our Lady of Angels, where he had bin to admoniſh Br. Helias of his temerity in deſiring to make a new rule, and that he had rudely ſhutt the gate vpon him, for which God would puniſh him. Which ſaid, he eaſily conducted Br. Bernard to the other ſide of the riuer, and then incontinentlie vaniſhed, leauing Br. Bernard exceedinglie comforted, who gaue thanckes to God for hauing viſited and aſsiſted him by his Angell. Being att Aſsiſium he recounted to the holy Father S. Francis and others, what the Angell had tould him of Brother Helias: by which meane it was knowne that he who was att the dore of the Couent of our Lady of Angels, and had ſpoken to Brother Helyas (as hath bin related in the 100. chapter of the firſt booke) was ſent of God, to propoſe vnto him the queſtion there ſett downe, to giue him occaſion of amendement.
               
               
                  How Brother Bernard receaued of almighty God the grace of extaticall contemplation and of the effectes therof, together with his abstinence.
                  THE IV. CHAPTER.
                  THis holy Father oftentimes retyred himſelfe from the worckes and labour of the actiue life (wherin he ſpent a good part of his time for the ſaluation of ſoules) to the repoſe of the contemplatiue life, whereby he obtained of God ſuch a ſublimitie of ſpiritt and clearneſſe of vnderſtandinge, that the deepeſt learned diuines repayred vnto him, to demaunde ſolution of

difficult and obſcure paſſages of the holy ſcripture: It ſeemed that his ſoule conuerſed continually in heauen. Sometimes he went ouer the mountaines entierly tranſported in God, rauiſhed as a propheticall ſpiritt in manifeſt ſigne of his continuall mentall eleuation. Fifteene yeares before his death, as he was ſpiritually in heauen, he had alſo his countenance euer lifted very high: in his iornyes, when he began to feele the force of ſpirituall extaſie, he would bid his companion to expect a while: then would turne out of the way and ſeeke ſome tree againſt which to reſt, and ſo held himſelfe firme and ſtable, that his ſpiritt might not wander diuers wayes, till the extaſie were ended. He one time ſaid to that great contemplatiue Brother Giles, that he made himſelfe but halfe a man, remayning as a woman, ſhut vp in his Cell, and not goeing abroad to teach men the right way of their ſaluation. Brother Giles anſweared him: O Brother, it is not permitted to all men to eat and flye as ſwallowes, as it is to you, who goeing, reſting, not ſtirring, and running in any place whatſoeuer, doe alwayes taſt the extaticall and diuine conſolation. For which cauſe ſainct Francis tooke great contentment to diſcourſe with him of matters concerning God, ſo that, to that effect, they were ſometimes found together in a wood, both rapt in extaſie, where they remayned in that manner a whole night together. As he one day heard Maſſe in the quier, he was ſo rauiſhed in ſpiritt, that he remayned till the ninth hower immoueable and inſenſible, with his eyes fixed towardes heauen. When he retourned to himſelfe he ſeemed vtterly amazed, and tourning to the other Religious he cryed out vnto them: My Brethren, is there any man, howſoeuer great, rich and noble he may be, that will not eſteeme it eaſy to carry a ſack full of dung, ordure, and carrion, if therfore he be promiſed a pallace full of gold? herby intendingWhat is to be don to gaine Paradiſe. to ſignify the immenſiue treaſure which God reſerueth for thoſe that are contrite in heart. But it is a thing worthy of eſpeciall note in him, that in fifteene yeares of his ſpirituall feruour, he neuer more then halfe ſatisfyed his appetite, though he did eat indifferentlie of euery permiſſable thing ſett before him: whervpon he would ſay, that it cannot be called abſtinence for a man to forbeare that which he taſteth not, ſeeing that this vertue fighteth againſt the taſt of that which pleaſeth and ſeemeth good vnto him: but becauſe few attaine to that perfection, it is beſt to ſhunne the occaſions.
               
               
                  
                  How this worthy ſeruant of God was tryed and exerciſed in patience and endurance of temptations.
                  THE V. CHAPTER.
                  BEcauſe almighty hath God oftē accuſtomed to proue his faithful ſeruantes by a reſtraint of ſpirituall conſolation, and of his ſweet preſence, he oftentimes afflicted him in this kinde: but afterwardes conſidering his notable conſtancie, he could not but comfort him. He once paſt eyght dayes, without taſting any ſweetnes of diuine conuerſation: that time by reaſon of his exceeding loue to almighty God, ſeemed vnto him eight yeares: he kept himſelfe ſolitary, and verie penſiue, continually praying God with much feruour, to reſtore vnto him the conſolation he deſired, and the ioy which by his preſence he receaued. Herevpon, there inſtantly appeared in the ayre, a hand bended, and as it were in action of ſtriking a viole, whence he felt ſo pleaſing and delightfull a harmony, that it filled his ſoule interiourly with ſuch and ſo excellent a ſweetnes, that if the ſound had longer endured, it had, (as to him ſeemed) diſſolued his ſoule from his bodye. Almighty God tryed him alſo, and exerciſed him exceedingly, by terrible and ſtrange temptations: which was reuealed in prayer to the holy Father ſainct Francis, who recommending him moſt affectionately to IESVS CHRIST, that he would pleaſe to aſsiſt him with his grace, and to giue him victory againſt ſuch potent and mortall ennemies, he heard a voice from heauen that ſaid: Feare not, for the temptations which aſſault Brother Bernard, are giuen him for exerciſe and for a crowne, and att lenght he ſhall haue the victory ouer all his ennemies. Beſides, know that Brother Bernard is one of the elect of the table of our Lord▪ Sainct Francis was ſo comforted with this voice, that he could not ſatisfye himſelfe with giuing thanckes to God: and thenceforth euer loued Brother Bernard better. He related all to his companions, adding that God would deliuer Brother Bernard of all his temptations, and before his death, would ſo ſetle his ſpiritt in peace, that all the Religious which ſhould behold him ſhould prayſe God for it, and that from heere below he ſhould aſcend to IESVS CHRIST, in that peace and ſpirituall tranquillity; which ſo came to paſſe.

                  Of the zeale of Religion, and the charity which Brother Bernard had towardes the ſicke.
                  THE VII. CHAPTER.
                  THe glorious Brother Bernard was ſo zealous of his rule and profeſsion, that he ſharply reprehended euery delinquent in that reſpect of what ſoeuer degree of ſuperiority he might be:He twice reprehended the Generall of his Order. as, hauing one day ſeene Brother Helias Generall, on a very luſty, faire, and fatt mule, he came behinde him, and with a great zeale reprehending him, ſaid: Brother Generall this beaſt wheron you ride, is very great and fatt, wheras you know our rule doth not permitt the ſame: then laying his hand on the rumpe of the mule, he repeated the ſame wordes, adding alſo many other. An other time, knowing that he was retired into his chamber, where with many other Religious he did 
                        •
                     eat meates delicately dreſſed, he was much troubled with the euill example of ſuch remiſſneſſe, wherfore he aroſe from the table of the refectory, taking his earthen diſh in one hand, and his cup in the other, and went to the chamber of the Generall, ouer againſt whome he ſate downe att the table, and ſayd: Brother I entend to eat with you this good meat, which is the almoſe of the poore of our Lord. Brother Helias with theſe wordes was not a litle troubled and confounded, yet he durſt not reply a word, knowing that he was eſteemed of the Religious for a very holy man, and as ſuch was generally reuerenced and honoured. This good Religious Brother Bernard, was alſo very charitable towardes the ſick. A Religious one day demaunding of him why he gaue ſo much to a ſick Religious perſon to eat, he anſweared: Brother, I doe it, therby to diſchardge on my part what is requiſite, and what charity commandeth me: you may well iudge that the ſicke eateth but according to his neceſsity.
               
               
                  
                  Of the death of the glorious Brother Bernard.
                  THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                  WHen it pleaſed God to call his ſeruant Brother Bernard out of this terreſtriall priſon, to his celeſtiall kingdome, he was aſſaulted with a violent diſeaſe, in which notwithſtanding he continued ſo intentiue in God, that he would not endure to heare ſpoaken or to thinck of any other thing. Vpon this occaſion when ſometimes the Religious that had care of him, putt vinegar with roſe water to his noſe, or therwith waſhed his wreſtes to recomfort him, knowing that the ſame did withdraw him from his diuine meditations, he would not permitt it to be applyed vnto him. If it chaunced that by ach of his head, or other occaſion, ſome ill cogitation that was not of God troubled his minde, reflecting inſtantly on him ſelfe, he would forciblie ſhake his head to expell and driue it away. And that he might haue no occaſion to be ſeparated one only moment from God, vpon the neceſsities of his body, he reſigned all his will, for the care of ſeconde cauſes and worldly reſpectes, into the handes of his Infirmarian, vſing vnto him theſe wordes: My beloued brother, I will no more thincke on the neceſsities of this body, I referre the care therof to you; wherfore vſe it as you ſhall thinck requiſit, I will take whatſoeuer you ſhall prepare me: If you giue me nothing, I will thinck of nothinge. Now becauſe, after the death of ſainct Francis all the Religious did reuerence Brother Bernard, as their Father, knowing this to be his laſt ſicknes, and that his death was neere, they for many reſpectes came to viſitt him▪ and among others, that worthy contemplatiue Br. Giles, who finding him weakened to ſo low an eſtate, ſaid vnto him: Sursū corda, Brother, Surſum corda. Brother Bernard att theſe wordes exceedingly reioyced, and awakening his ſpiritt, anſweared: Habemus ad Dominum: and willed one of the Religious to prepare ſome conuenient place for Br. Giles, that he might remaine neere vnto, during the time he had yet to liue, that he might applie himſelfe to the exceſſes of contemplation: his ſickneſſe encreaſing, he would not be without a Preiſt, &amp; att euery moment that anything occured to his memory worthy of cōfeſsion, he hūbly acknowledged it to his Cōfeſſour. The laſt day of his ſicknes whē ſomething was preſēted to him to eat, he called all the Religious and prayed thē to eat with him, ſaying: My Brethren I beſeech you to celebrate with me this my laſt hower: and then diſcouered vnto them ſuch a feruour of charity and deuotion, that many Religious admiring it, confeſſed that

albeit they eſteemed him a ſainct, yet they neuer ſo much experienced the excellencie of his vertue and ſanctity as att that time. After he had receaued the ſacrament of extreme vnction, he ſetled himſelfe decently,God aſſisteth in tribulations. and ſaid to all his Religious: My Brethren, I beſeech you for euer to remember this my houre, wherto you muſt all come in your degree. And I confeſſe and aſſure you that I haue neuer bin a Frere Minor, but in temptations; conſidering that in them I haue euer found God to aſſiſt me: and now I feele ſuch a contentment, that I would not haue omitted to ſerue God for a thouſand ſuch worldes as this. Now I accuſe my ſelfe to God and you, of all the offences I haue committed: and in this my laſt houre doe beſeech you to loue one an other, for this ſhalbe a ſigne wherby you ſhalbe knowne to be diſciples of IESVS CHRIST.Admirable conſolation att the point of death. S. Ioā. 13. After ſuch and the like wordes, his face became ſo ioyfull and cleare, that they all admired: and in that ioy his bleſſed ſoule paſſed from this vale of miſeries, to the repoſe of glory: his fleſh continued ſo cleare, tender and plumme, as that of a ſucking child, and his countenance appeared ſo liuely, as that the Religious could not ſatisfie themſelues with contemplating (as in a ſhadow) the great ſplendour which his ſoule was to receaue in heauen: att length he was ſolemnly enterred in the Couent of S. Francis att Aſsiſium neere vnto the ſepulcher of the holy Father, where were preſent a great aſſembly of people.
               
               
                  How the glory of Br. Bernard was reuealed to Br. Leo, and Br. Ruffin.
                  THE IX. CHAPTER.
                  THe glory which God had ordayned for him was in this mannea reuealed to two Religious the companions of S. Frrncis, att the ſame inſtant that he dyed: Br. Leo, and Br. Ruffinus lay ſick in a village neere to Portiuncula, where in one night they ſaw appeare vnto them a great nomber of Frere Minors goeing in proceſsion, among whome they ſaw one more note-worthy then the reſt, out of whoſe eyes iſſued beames more glittering then the ſunne ſo that they could no longer hold their eyes fixed on him. They asked one of the Religious whither they went, and they anſweared that they were come to ſeeke a ſoule that ſhould accompany Br. Bernard to glorie, who att that veryBr. Bernard alwayes iudged in the beſt ſenſe. hower was departed this mortall life, and that was he, out of whoſe eyes they ſaw ſo much light proceed: which God permitted, becauſe he alwayes iudged well of his neighbour, &amp; whē he ſaw any poore people in ragged &amp; pached cloathes, he would ſay to himſelfe: theſe obſerue pouerty better thē thee Br. Bernard, &amp; iudged as though they had promiſed to obſerue holy pouerty. When he ſaw men richly and ſumptuously

attired, he would ſay with great compunction of his ſoule: It may very well be that theſe gentlemen weare vnder that precious habitt, ſome hairecloth, wherby they weaken, mortifie and chaſtice their fleſh: and exteriourly appearing to be full of vanity, they ſhunne vaine glory: which thou, Br. Bernard, performeſt not with thy poore patched habitt, though thou be generally eſteemed a great penitent. And this glory alſo is giuen him becauſe what ſoeuer good he ſaw in the creatures, the ſame he referred to the Creatour, and gaue him thanckes for it. Which ſayd, the proceſsion diſappeared.
               
               
                  The life of Br. Ruffinus, companion of S. Francis.
                  Of the vertues in generall and ſanctitie of Brother Ruffinus, by the restimonie of Sainct Francis.
                  THE X. CHAPTER.
                  GOd adorned and enriched the firſt Frere Minors, with the apparant and excellent vertues of Br. Ruffinus, as a ſhining rainebow through the cloudes with the beautifull variety of faire coulers, and as a vermillian roſe, for his feruent charity, and as a white lilly for his purity, yelding a moſt pleaſing ſauour to the Church of God. This bleſſed Br. Ruffinus, was borne at Aſsiſium, of a very noble family, and nere of kinred to the glorious S. Clare. He was conuerted to God by the examples and documentes of the holy F. S. Francis, he tooke the habitt of the Frere Minors, and was profeſſed for ſuch, as is formerly recorded in the 17. cha. of the firſt booke and firſt volume: he kept himſelfe a true virgin, &amp; obtained of God a ſinguler grace of contēplation. He was of a gracious &amp; amiable conuerſation among men. As one day he retourned frō prayer, he paſſed before S. Francis goeing to his cell, who ſeeing him comming a farre off, demaunded of his cōpanions that were about him, what ſoule in this world, was in their opinion moſt pleaſing to his diuine maieſty. They very hūbly anſweared that they knew not, but it ſeemed to thē that his ſoule was more pleaſing to God, thē any other that they knew in the world, by reaſon of the ſinguler graces which he had receaued of his diuine maieſty. But S. Francis thus replyed: My Brethrē, I tell you and aduertiſe you that as for my ſelfe, I am the moſt vile and vnworthie ſeruant that God hath in this world, and he hath reuealed vnto me that the ſoule of Br. Ruffinus is one of the three moſt holyeſt in the world, ſo that I may ſecurely call him S. euen in this life, ſith he hath reuealed vnto me withall, that his ſoule is canonized in heauen.
               
               
                  
                  Of the ready obedience of Br. Ruffinus.
                  THE XI. CHAPTER.
                  THis good Religious B. Ruffinus, was as it were inſenſible of exteriour thinges, by reaſon of his continuall exerciſe of prayer, he had as an other Moyſes an vnſeemely grace of ſpeech, ſo that his wordes ſeemed to be forcibly drawne out of his mouth, and therfore he ſpake litle. Yet though in that reſpect he were very vnfitt to preach, S. Francis neuertheles cōmanded him one day to goe to Aſsiſium to preach what the holie Ghoſt ſhould inſpire him: wherin he excuſing himſelfe, the S. to chaſtice his diſobedience, cauſed him to goe thither without his capuce, which he ioyful executed &amp; preached to the people. But S. Frācis, to chaſtice himſelfe for ſo ſtrange a commandement, followed him alſo without capuce (or as ſome affirme naked.) And in that manner did end the ſermon which Br. Ruffinus had begun, with ſuch cōpunction &amp; effuſion of teares of the people, as if it had bin good friday: as hath bin more amply diſcourſed in the 30. chapter of the firſt booke and firſt volume of this firſt part; the great obedience of Br. Ruffinus requiring ſo admirable an effect, to the ſpirituall profitt of the people.
               
               
                  How the deuils feared and shunned Br. Ruffinus.
                  THE XII. CHAPTER.
                  THis Religious S. was for his great humility and purity ſo fearedThe deuil leſt one that was poſseſſed att the only ſight of Br. Ruffinus. of the deuils, that they could not endure his preſence, as in diuers accidents hath bin experienced, and one time particulerlie when he went a begging in the Cittie of Aſsiſium, meeting many men that led one poſſeſſed very ſtrongly bound and tyed towardes S. Francis to be diſpoſſeſſed, he ſeeing Br. Ruffinus cryed out very loud and gaue ſuch a ſtraine, that breaking the cordes wherwith he was bound, he eſcaped and ran from the men that held him, who getting hold of him againe, and much admiring ſuch an vnwounted act, asked him the cauſe therof, &amp; he anſweared, I did it, becauſe that ſame Br. Ruffinus which asked almoſe hath by his vertues and prayers ſo burned me, that I cannot remaine in this body: which ſpoken he preſently fled and left the poore man deliuered.
                  The holy Father S. Francis being one time in prayer on the mount Aluerne in a ſequeſtred cell, the deuilles laboured to diſquiett him, caſting ſtones very furiously and making ſuch a noyſe, that the mountaine

ſeemed ready to be ouerthrowne: it chaunced that in the meane time Br.And left to trouble S. Franc. Ruffin. paſſed that way, who cōming to aske S. F. his benediction, called to him a farre, ſaying: God be prayſed, and incontinētly the deuils making an extreme noyſe fled away. S. Francis that had heard the voice of Br. Ruffinus, &amp; had alſo heard the flight of the deuils, ſodenly goeing out of his cell, cryed vnto thē: Yee Proud creatures, ſtay the cōming of B. Ruffinus, that he may chaſtice you, for he knoweth you very well.
                  
                     Ten poſſeſſed perſons fled frō him. It happened an other time that ten poſſeſſed perſonnes which were abroad in the fieldes, mett there Br. Ruffinus, whome hauing ſcene they preſently fled, and being demaunded of ſome that paſſed by why they haſtened away, they anſweared: by reaſon of that Br. Ruffinus, by whome weare preſſed as grapes in the wine preſſe.
               
               
                  The thirtenth chapter which should follow here, is inſerted before, to better purpoſe, touching a greatt temptation of Br. Ruffin and how he ſurmounted the deuils by vertue of the prayer of S. Francis.
                  THE XIII. CHAPTER.
                  THis chapter is not conuenient to be placed here, as well becauſe the ſubiect therof happened to him before he attayned to ſuch perfection, and therfore this can be no proper place for it, as alſo becauſe it is amply diſcourſed in the 45. chapter of the firſt booke, and firſt volume of this firſt part.
               
               
                  Of the death of the glorious Br. Ruffinus, and of the apparition he had a litle before his death.
                  THE XIV. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Ruffinus and Br. Leo were both ſick att one ſame time, as we haue formerly ſaid in the laſt chapter of the life of Br. Bernard. Now as vpon this admirable viſion they diſcourſed with themſelues, of the ſoule of the ſaid Brother Bernard, and that they came for an other ſoule. Brother Leo thincking it to be himſelfe that ſhould dye, becauſe he felt himſelfe very ſicke, he aroſe out of his bedde as well as he could, and went very ioyfully to the bed of Brother Ruffinus, to whome he ſaid: Brother reſt in peace for it is the will of God that I now dye to goe to his glory. Brother Ruffinus anſweared him: Brother you are deceaued, for the viſion which you haue had, and the wordes which haue bin ſpoaken to you, are to be vnderſtood of me, &amp; not of you, for our holy Father S. Francis, glorious

as he is, came lately thither, accompanyed with a great nomber of Religious, who told me I was to paſſe from this miſerable life to the moſt bleſſed, in very ſhort time: for earneſt pledge wherof, he gaue me a ſweet and gracious kiſſe, through which my mouth and lippes continue full of miraculous ſweetnes. And that you may belieue me, come neere &amp; you ſhall know it. Brother Leo comming neere vnto him, felt ſuch a ſweetneſſe of that precious odour, that he was fully aſſured of what Brother Ruffinus had ſayd: ſo the time of his departure drawing on, he called all the Religious of the Couent before him, whome he animated to the obſeruance of their profeſsion and to fraternall charity by moſt pious and excellent diſcourſes, in the middeſt of which his ſoule▪ departed to eternall peace, with that glorious company which expected him in heauen: and his body was buryed in the Couent of ſainct Francis, where were already enterred ſome other of his diſciples and deere companions.
               
               
                  The life of brother Leo.
                  How Brother Leo was familier companion, Confeſſour, and Secretary to ſainct Francis.
                  THE XV. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Leo was Confeſſour and Secretary to ſainct Francis, in which function after he had much profited in the actiue life, by all kinde of vertues and perfections, he was by the diuine grace brought to the delicious garden of the contemplation and holy conuerſation of ſainct Francis, and in regard that he was ſingulerly adorned and endued with the vertue of ſimplicity, the Sainct particulerly affected him, and reioyced much in his familiarity. Sometimes he would call him Brother beaſt, and ſimple ſheep of God: and intending to decipher a true Frere Minor, he would ſay that the Religious who had the ſimplicity and purity of Brother Leo, was really a Frere Minor. Now as he was almoſt alwayes companion to ſainct Francis, ſo had he the fauour to ſee him many times in extaſie, &amp; his body lifted vp in the ayre aboue the trees, and then himſelfe would fall on the ground in the very place whence the Sainct was eleuated into the aire, and demaund of God mercy in fauour of his Sainct. It was he alone that merited to be companion of the Sainct that Lent, which he kept of ſainct Michael Th'archangell, when he receaued the ſacred ſtigmates on the Mount Aluerne: where he was participant of all the merueilous apparitions &amp; reuelations that did precede the ſeraphichal apparition of

IESVS CHRIST. And he was the firſt to whome the holy Father ſhewed his ſacred ſtigmates, as to his moſt deere and cordiall freind, and to the Father of his ſoule that did daily dreſſe them, as in many places of his life hath bin very amply diſcourſed.
                  Part of the 16. chapter, which followeth in the Spanish text, is placed in the middeſt of the 11. chapter of the ſecond booke and firſt volume of this part: becauſe thy are certaine reuelations of ſainct Francis which ſainct Leo had, the rest is that which followeth.
                  
                     How it was reuealed to brother Leo, that vnleſſe we be aſsiſted of God, we can doe nothing of our ſelues.
                     BRother Leo one time in prayer, had a cogitation of preſumption, truſting on himſelfe and his vertues: And being in this cogitation, there appeared vnto him a hand, and he heard a voice from aboue that ſaid vnto him: Brother Leo, know that without this hand thou canſt performe no good thinge. Which Brother Leo hauing heard, entierly enflamed in diuine loue, he aroſe on his feet, and beholding heauen, he diuers times thus ſpake with a loud voice: It is true my God, that if thy puiſſant hand doe not helpe and aſsiſt our infirmity, we can doe nothing of ourſelues: much leſſe ſhall we reſiſt our ennemies, and obtaine the meritt of perſeuerance in thy loue and ſeruice.
                     The 17. chapter is put after the laſt of the ſecond booke and firſt volume of this first part, where is related a viſion which Brother Leo had, of the vniuerſall Iudgement, as being a matter appertaining to the holy Father ſainct Francis.
                  
               
               
                  How Brother Leo burned the box which Brother Helias Generall of the Order had ſett at the Church dore, to gather almoſe for the fabrique, againſt the purity of the rule.
                  THE XVIII. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Helias, who after the death of ſainct Francis for many yeares gouerned the Religion as General, was he that very ſumptuously builded the Couent of S. Francis att Aſsiſium, where Pope Gregory the ninth layd the firſt ſtone: the almoſe of the people of

Aſsiſium not ſufficing for ſo great an edifice, Brother Helias ſeeking all meanes poſsible to find mony for the worck, ſett a box att the Church dore with this inſcription: The almoſe for the ſabriq
                           •
                        e, which many good Religious hauing ſeene, and eſpecially Brother Leo, in regard that it was a thing directly againſt the obſeruance of the purity of their rule, being zealous of the Euangelicall Pouertie, they repaired to the venerable Brother Giles to conſult with him, and to aduiſe together by what meanes they might preuent this inconuenience: who anſweared that he dwelt att our Lady of Angels, and therfore though one built a Couent as great as the Citty of Aſsiſium, he would notwithſtanding be content to remaine wher he was, and that was all his care. But Brother Leo not ſatisfied with this anſweare, they added: we haue a purpoſe to burne that box: what think you of it? Brother Giles then with teares of his eyes replyed: If Brother Helias be dead, you may doe ſo; but if he liue, lett him proceed, for you will hardly endure his perſec ution. But Brother Leo and his companions leauing Brother Giles, tooke the box and burned it, which Brother Helias vnderſtanding, and being extremely vexed therwith, he very cruelly diſciplined them all: and hauing detayned thē ſome time in priſon, he baniſhed them from Aſsiſium: for which and other like matters, the Pope put Brother Helias from his Prelature: as we haue formerly related in the life of S. Antony of Padua.
               
               
                  Of certaine miracles, and of the death of the glorious Brother Leo▪
                  
                  THE XIX. CHAPTER.
                  WHiles Brother Leo reſided att our Lady of Angels, it happened that a poore woman of Aſsiſium dyed in trauaile of child, whoſe mother was alſo a very poore old widdoe, who being much afflicted att the death of her daughter, and not knowing how to bring vp the litle infant that was left vnto her, ſhe went to brother Leo for his counſaile, to whome with teares diſcouering her greife, ſhe moued him to haue compaſsion of her miſery, ſo that he went and with feruour offred his prayers, demaunding of God aſsiſtance for that ſo deſolate poore old womā. His prayer ended,Br. Leo obtained milke for an old woman to nurſe a child. he ſayd vnto her: Goe good woman, and putt the child to thy breaſt, and hope that almighty God will giue thee the milke that he would haue giuen the mother of the child. Though this old woman was much amazed att this ſpeech, yet the infant being preſent, ſhe obeyed: for ſhe offered her breaſtes vnto it, which were found very full of milke to relieue the child. And the ſame continued as long as there was vſe for it, and the child attayning to competentage beame a man of the church.

He often recounted that he had bin miraculously nurſed by the merittes of Brother Leo.
                  
                     He foretold a yong man that he should be a Frere Minor. With the ſigne of the croſſe he cured an apoſtume. A peece of his habit cured the falling ſickneſſe. He miraculouſly deliuered a priſoner. This ſeruant of God meeting a yong man in the way, and beholding his countenance, ſayd vnto him: thou ſhalt be one of our Religious: which wordes had ſuch efficacie in his hart, that he could neuer apply himſelfe to any thing, till he became a Frere Minor
                  A woman of Codale, in the vally of Spoletum, hauing an apoſtume in her breſt, which ordinarily yelded forth corruption, and being void of all helpe that might any way releiue her, ſhe repaired to Brother Leo, with great deuotion praying him to make the ſigne of the croſſe one the place greiued: which being done, the apoſtume vaniſhed, ſo that no apparance remayned therof.
                  A yong man being exceedingly afflicted with the falling ſicknes and a continuall feauer, did ſecretly cutt of a peece of the habitt of Brother Leo, out of the great deuotion he carryed towardes him, which hauing layd on his neck, he was preſently cured: but hauing loſt it, the ſaid infirmity retourned, yet hauing gotten an other peece, he was perfectly cured againe.
                  A man of Treuy, being by commandement of the gouernour of Spoletum impriſoned and enchained, he recommended himſelfe to the prayers of Brother Leo who was att our Lady of Angels, who appeared vnto him about the time of noone, and in preſence of all that were there, vnchayned him, then drew him out of priſon, and commanded him to goe as a Pilgrime to our Lady of Angels; which hauing performed, he there found Brother Leo, att whoſe feet proſtrating himſelfe, he thancked him for the great &amp; ſinguler fauour receaued of him. But he anſweared him, that he ſhould only thancke the Virgin Mary, whoſe feaſt of her holy purification was celebrated that day. Our lord wrought many other miracles by the merittes of his ſeruant Brother Leo, to manifeſt his ſanctity to the world, which would be too tedious to be inſerted. That holy Father Brother Ruffinus and Brother Angel us by commandement of their generall compoſed the legend of ſainct Francis, which was afterward called the legend of three companions, wherof the moſt worthy and remarckable hauing bin extracted and put in other hiſtories of ſainct Francis, the ſame was afterwardy loſt. Brother Leo att length hauing in vertue and ſanctity accompliſhed his dayes, he left the deſert of the world, and retired to his celeſtiall contry. He was enterred att Aſsiſium, in the Church of S. Francis.

                  Of the conuerſation, merittes and death of Br. Sylueſter.
                  THE XX. CHAPTER.
                  THe good Father Br. Silueſter, was the firſt preiſt that entred into the Religion of S. Francis. In the firſt booke and firſt volume of this firſt part we haue ſett downe his conuerſion, and how he became a Frere Minor. This was his eleuenth diſciple, who ſo encreaſed and profited in the vertue of ſanctity, that he diſcourſed and conuerſed with God, as ordinarily one freind doth with an other: which S. Francis often experienced, and diuers times gaue teſtimony therof, as when he reuealed vnto him that the will of God was they ſhould apply themſelues to preaching: And alſo when S. Francis commanded him to chaſe the deuils out of the citty of Arezzo, which is amply diſcourſed in the fift and ſixt chapters of the firſt booke of this firſt part. Now this holy ſeruant of God, after he had perfectly ſerued his maieſty many yeares, repoſed in peace, and was buryed att Aſsiſium in the Church of S. Francis, with his other companions.
               
               
                  The life of Brother Macie.
                  Of the holy conuerſation and obedience of Br. Macie.
                  THE XXI. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Macie of Marignan, was very prudent, and well borne, God gaue him the talent of commendable ſpeech, eſpecially whē he diſcourſed of ſpirituall thinges, and therfore S. Francis often had him in company, that they who came to ſee and viſitt him, might be ſo well entertayned by the delightfulneſſe of his diſcourſe, that they ſhould not trouble him in his prayer. Now the holy Father S. Francis, as a diſcreet paſtour that continually watcheth ouer his flock, conſidering that Br. Macie dayly encreaſed in vertue, to the end that no vanity ſhould cauſe him to fall from the hight of his prudence, he ſought to ground him well on the firme and ſecure foundation of humilitie; wherefore he one day in preſence of the other Religious ſaid 
                        〈◊◊〉
                      Brother, theſe your companions here, haue obtayned of God the grace of prayer and contemplation, and you haue receaued the grace of diſcourſe: and therfore you are moſt fitt to entertaine thoſe without the gate that

come to viſitt vs. Therfore I am reſolued that your Brethren here ſhall all apply themſelues to contemplation, and that you ſhall haue care of the gate, of the kitchen, and of begging: ſo that no other Religious ſhalbe troubled with any temporall care. When the Brethren ſhall eat in the refectory, you ſhalbe without the do
                        •
                     e, that ſtrangers may be entertained by your good ſpeeches, before they ring, ſo that it may be no trouble to them to expect: all this ſhall you performe by the merittes of holy obedience. Br. Macie very ioyfully accepted all, and for a time exerciſed it, till the other Religious hauing knowne the vertue he had in prayer, and the other partes of his perfection, they obtayned of S. Francis, who alſo knewe him 
                        •
                     ight well, that all the offices which he had might be equally diuided among them.
                  The 22. chapter, is placed after the 100. of the firſt booke of this preſent part, becauſe it is a matter particulerlie appertayning to Sainct Francis: it is an exerciſe of mortification performed by Brother Macie.
               
               
                  How Br. Macie obtained of God the vertue of humilitie.
                  THE XXIII. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Leo entring one day into ſpirituall diſcourſes with Br. Macie, and ſome other Religious, among other thinges he ſaid: I know a worthy ſeruant of God (meaning S. Francis) that hath obtayned many graces of his diuine maieſty, as well in the actiue as contemplatiue life, and with his graces, he hath ſo profound a humility, that he thincketh there is not in the world ſo great a ſinner as himſelfe. This humility maketh him merueilously to encreaſe in ſanctity, and ſo confirmeth him in the grace of God, that whiles he ſhall haue the ſame for his roote, which he hath already engrafted in God, it is impoſſible for him to fall. As Brother Leo thus diſcourſed of humilitie▪ Brother Macie that gaue attentiue eare vnto him, became ſo affected to this vertue ſo gratefull to God, that he went to his prayer and hauing lifted his eyes towardes heauen, he vowed to almighty God that he would neuer take ioy of this world, till he knew and felt in his ſoule, that God had giuen him this vertue of humility: and ſo by ſighes and teares he afflicted himſelfe before almightie God, and ſeeming to himſelfe that he iuſtly deſerued hell, if he did not obtaine this grace and vertue, wherby that worthy freind of God which was full of all perfection, reputed himſelfe inferiour to all creatures, and perſiſting continually in this griefe, obſeruing the vow which he had made, and perſeuering in his petition vnto God, ſacrificing

himſelfe by abſtinences, diſciplines and teares, he deſerued att lengh
                        •
                      as he went one day alone to pray on the mountaine, to heare a voice from heauen that twice called him by his name. Wherefore he knowing the voice of God, preſently anſweared: Lord here I am: and then God ſaid vnto him: What wilt thou giue me, if I giue thee the vertue of humility, which with ſo great inſtance thou haſt demaunded of me? Br. Macie then anſweared: My God I will giue thee all that I haue to my very eyes: But God anſweared: keep thy eyes: I will giue three gratis a gift of what thou haſt demaunded. And from that hower Br. Macie had entier poſſeſsion of the humility which he had ſo much deſired, together with ſuch a diuine light, that he liued almoſt alwayes in a continuall ſpirituall ioy, as if himſelfe had no longer liued, but IESVS CHRIST only in him.
               
               
                  How Br. Macie deſired to obtaine of God, to loue his ennemies as his deerest friendes.
                  THE XXIV. CHAPTER.
                  BVt this ioy continued not long, as it happeneth of the waters of God, the thirſt wherof augmenth the more by drincking therof: for after he had receaued this grace he became more ſorrowfull then before, by reaſon of the vehement deſire he had to obtayne a greater: which the other Religious perceauing, they one day called him and ſayed▪ Tell vs Br. Macie, are we cauſe of thy ſorrow? or what ſtraunge thing is happened? we were wont to ſee thee exceeding ioyfull, and with a gracious and ſmiling contenance, but now we ſee thee very melancholy and much troubled. Br. Macie anſweared them: My deere brethren you doe not cauſe or procure me any heauineſſe; but I will tell you whence it proceedeth. You muſt know, that ſome dayes paſt I haue laboured to obtaine of almighty God the precious vertue of holy humility, by meane wherof I thinck to acknowledge my ſelfe the moſt vile and greateſt ſinner in the world, as in deed I am. And becauſe my humane reaſon (in reſpect of its pride) could not conceaue that the man which is day and night exerciſed in wachinges, abſtinēces, prayers, and other practiſes of vertue, doth not eſteeme himſelfe much better then him who is daily employed in ſpeaking ill, or liuing idly, or brutiſhly, without obſeruing his promiſed vowes: att length God, of his mercy hath graunted me this humility, which by any ſpirituall exerciſe, by prayer, or whatſoeuer other meritt can neuer be obtayned. Know yee then, that the cauſe of my ſorrow is, that I cannot arriue to this degree: if any one ſhould cutt off my handes and

feet, and cruſh out my eyes, though I ſhould pardon him and doe him all the ſeruices I could deuiſe: I ſhould not yet with ſo good a will loue him as before. This is that which I demaund of my God, for the hight and perfection of the grace which he hath graunted me: and then ſhall my ſoule be entierly ioyfull and content, as I hope, being conformable vnto his will, he will afford me the ſame.
                  All this is ſpoaken to lett you vnderſtand, what were the cogitatiōs, and what the deſires of the firſt Fathers of the Order of S. Francis, what were their gold, their ſiluer, theirticheſſe, and their treaſures, ſuch were their practiſes and negotiations, to witt, to learne only the meane to obtaine the perfection of vertues, which are the merchandiſe wherwith is purchaced the kingdome of heauen, and are the precious ſtones which the wiſe and ſpirituall merchant ſhould ſeeke: and the treaſure for purchaſe wherof he ſhould not only ſell all he hath in the world, but euen the deſires of whatſoeuer he may haue: as alſo all temporall taſt and ſelfe will, eating, drincking, and sleeping; and by meane of very ſtrict abſtinence, of mortifications, watchinges, teares, and prayers they obtayned of God the vertues which they demaunded: and hauing obtayned them, doe poſſeſſe and conſerue them to the great glory of God, to the profitt of their ſoules, and to the exceeding edification of their neighbour.
               
               
                  Of the counſaile which Br. Macie gaue to a murmurer, to correct his fault.
                  THE XXV. CHAPTER.
                  THere was a very deuout man that ordinarily frequēted the Couent of the Frere Minors of Cybotoly neere Peruſia, and diſcourſing with the Religious, he alwayes murmured att the ſinnes of his neighbours, committed in his Citty. Br. Macie hauing often times heard him, could no longer endure him: for hauing formerly forborne him in reſpect of the preſence of the Guardian, att length he drew him a part and ſayd. My ſonne I beſeech you take the conſaile that I giue you, as from one of yeares. Haue alwayes before your eyes and in your mouth the life of the holy and vertuous, and alwayes ſpeake of their good conditions: for, doeing ſo, if thou be euill, thou wilt become good: and if thou be good, thou wilt therby become better. But be not delighted, yea ſhunne with all poſsible care, to ſpeake or heare ſpoaken of the ſinnes and defectes of your neighbour: for att length, of good you will become euill, and of bad farre worſe, and will doe the ſame you heard ſpoaken of them. Theſe pious wordes did not a litle profitt this miſerable man, in regard that Brother Macie had ſuch

a grace of deliuery, that whatſoeuer he ſpake was to each one gratefully accepted, and imprinted in the hearer. Wherfore S. Francis deſcribing a perfect Frere Minor, among other conditions, he muſt haue, (would he ſay) the religious and good conceite, the naturall ſcience, and ſpirituall eloquence of Brother Macie.
               
               
                  Of the prayer of Brother Macie, and of his holy death.
                  THE XXVI. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Macie was a Religious exceedingly addicted to prayer▪ yea more then any other, ſhedding therin day and night abondance of teares, as to al his Brethrē was moſt manifeſt. He did eat only once a day, which was towardes the euening, the night being come he tooke his reſt, about midinght he aroſe, and continued in prayer till day, in which the other Religious heard him often to repeat theſe wordes: My Lord IESVS CHRIST giue me if thou pleaſe, true contrition of my ſinnes, and giue me grace to amende, and to ſatisfie thee according to thy holy will: which wordes he neuer ceaſſed to repeat, till he bathed and diſſolued in teares: in the morning hauing heard maſſe, he retyred into his cell, and ſinging with a very deuout tune, would ſay: My Lord IESV CHRIST, permitt me I beſeech thee, to feare thee, and to loue thee with all my hart: then falling to prayer he was heard often to repeat, vh, vh, vh with a contented, ioyfull, and feruent voice. In his contemplation, his countenance was alwayes very pleaſing and ioyfull. Brother Iames of Falerone, a Religious of exceeding piety, demaunding of him one day, becauſe he had often ſeene and heard him in this ſpirituall ioy to vtter thoſe wordes without chaunge, why he did not varifie his tune; he redily anſweared: becauſe finding all good and contentment in one thing, it is not needfull to change the tune. Thus this holy Father, repleniſhed with many graces and merittes, paſſed from this temporall life to the celeſtiall and eternall, and was buryed in the Church of ſainct Francis att Aſsiſium, where were his other companions: ſome are of opinion that his body lyeth att Mur in the Marquiſat of Ancona.

How Brother Zacharie and Brother Walter, were by commandement of the holly Father ſainct Francis ſent into Portugall, and of the first Monastery they founded there.
                  THE XXVII. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Zacharie and Brother Walter were ſent by the holy F. S. Francis with ſome other Religious, into Portugall, there, by their preachinges and good examples to conuert ſinners to penance, where being arriued, they were ill treated and entertained, as well becauſe they were ſtrangers, as for the nouelty of their habitt: theire defect of the Spaniſh tongue, was cauſe that they were not gratefully heard, and that they did not willingly diſcourſe, and hauing no letters or patentes of the approbation of their rule and profeſsion, they could no where be receaued, for the Portugals feared that they might be ſome heretikes of Italy, where then were many: ſo that theſe good Religious were conſtrayned to repaire vnto the queene Vraca, the wife of Alfonſus the ſecond, to whome they recounted their perſecution, and prayed her to beſtow on them ſome litle church or chappel, where they might ſecurely remaine, and celebrate the diuine ſeruice. This queene hauing graciously entertayned them, ſhe curiously enformed her ſelfe of their life, eſtate, and rule, and the cauſe of their comming into Portugall, and reſting at length ſufficiently aſſured that they were the true ſeruantes of IESVS CHRIST, and profeſſours of the obſeruation of the Euangelicall life, ſhe procured for them of the king a litle place nere vnto the Citty of Conimbria, among the hermitages there, and alſo permiſsion to goe to Lisbone and to the cittye of Guimaranes, where the reputation of their ſanctity being ſpred, came euen to the Princes Saucia, ſiſter to the ſaid king Alfonſus, a very deuoute lady, and enclined to allThe Frere Minors were eſtablished in Portugall by two Princeſſe. vertues, who had cōſecrated her virginity to IESVS CHRIST, &amp; dwelt in the Citty of Alenquer. She exceedingly deſiring to ſee and know theſe Frere Minors, which were ſo much ſpoaken of ſent for thē, and hauing heard thē diſcourſe of God, and obſerued &amp; remarked their ſpirit &amp; vertue, would not permitt them to depart from her, but lodged them in her owne pallace, and aſsigned them a Church neere to the water where there were many poore celles, ſuch as they required: and there did they remayne with out deſire of any other, or conſent to haue them bettered they being proper to the true life of theſe perfect poore of our Lord, the firſt founder of the ſacred Religion of S. Francis. The place which theſe firſt Religious poſſeſſed, is now the Church of ſaincte Catherine, att the foot of the Citty of Alenquer, as is found recorded.
               
               
                  
                  Of the ſanctity and miracles of Brother Zachary, who was the firſt Guardian of the Couent of Alenquer, and of his death.
                  THE XXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe ſaid Monaſtery being thus founded with exceeding pouerty and ſanctity, by the vertue and exemplar life of the ſayd diſciples of the glorious Father ſainct Francis, and namely of Brother Zachary, as being the moſt notable in all vertues. This holy Father zealous towardes God in worckes of charity, in watchinges and prayers, did often offer his prayers before a Crucifix, which was after in the Chapiter of the ſaid Couent of Alenquer till the yeare 1414. by which our Lord aduertiſed him of many thinges, as well concerning his owne as his neighbours welfare. The conſolation and ſpirituall ioy which he receaued of this image was ſuch, as he could not leaueGod miraculouſly prouided for the Frere Minors of Alenquer. it but with great greife. Brother Zacharie being Guardian, it one day happened that there were but two loaues of bread in al the Couent: the hower of refection being come, he enioyned all the brethren to prayer, then commanded them to ſitt downe att table, and the ſayd loaues to be portioned among all the Religious, and att the ſame inſtant there appeared an Angell att their gate, in forme of a beautifull yong man, who brought them as many loaues as there were perſons in the Monaſtery, his grace and beauty was ſuch as could be imagined. He calling for the Guardian gaue it vnto him, who with the other Religious knowing this preſent to come to them from the hand of God, who hauing care of all his creatures, neuer forgetteth his true poore, they gaue him thanckes for it: Many kept of this bread as a holy relique: but namely the Princeſſe Saucia who would haue her part therof. Preaching on a time with great zeale of the faith of IESVS CHRIST and of the ſaluation of ſoules, one that was incredulous being partly contrite and conuerted by his ſermon, would afterwardes confeſſe vnto him, but by all the induſtry the good Father could deuiſe, he could not rid him of his doubtes touching the Bleſſed ſacrament of the Euchariſt. ArtNetable miracle of the Sacrament of the Eucharist. length hauing an exceeding deſire to ſaue his ſoule, he ſayd vnto him: Sith thou canſt not be cured by the wordes of God, come againe to morrow in the morning, with the greateſt deuotion thou canſt, and perhappes it will pleaſe our Lord IESVS CHRIST, to illuminate and confirme thee by his diuine preſence: and ſo diſmiſsing him, and that day ended, the Sainct ſpent all that night in deuotion, praying God to voutſafe to illuminate and confirme this poore

man in the holy faith. The next morning, he celebrated maſſe, this man being preſent with great deuotion, but the wordes of conſecration being vttered, he ſaw the ſacred hoſt conuerted into fleſh, and ſo continuyng till the Preiſt was ready to communicate: and then he ſaw it retourne to the forme of an hoſt as before the conſecration. This admirable viſion entierly cleered his ſoule of all doubtes he had, and fully confirmed him in the Catholike faith. This glorious FatherThe earth of the tōbe of Br. Zachary worketh miracles. att length yelding vp his ſoule, it aſcended to heauen, and his body was buryed on the right ſide of the croſſe of the Church of the ſaid Couent in Alenquer, with his other companions and the holy diſciples of the glorious Father ſainct Francis. The inhabitants of Alenquer att this preſent take the earth of that ſepulcher, and with great reuerence apply it to the ſicke, who therby recouer their health.
               
               
                  Of a Religious that was diſciple to ſainct Francis, in the Couent of Alenquer.
                  THE XXIX. CHAPTER.
                  AMong all the Religious that were ſent by the holy Father ſaint Francis to the ſaid Couent of Alenquer, there was one very deuout and ſolitary, that, flying eſpecially all conuerſation and diſcourſes with women, ſpent almoſt all his time in prayer. Now it happened that one of the ladyes of the Princes Saucia, called Mary Gracia, noting this Religious to be ſo ſpirituall, began to haue perticuler deuotion vnto him; and therfore ſhe deſired to haue ſome conference witht him. But this holy Religious refuſig all acquaintance and ſpeech with any women, ſhunned her with all endeauour. Neuertheles it once happened that the Lady and the Religious in ſuch ſort met each with other, that the Religious could not without diſcurteſie auoyd to ſpeake vnto her: for ſhe much vrged him therto: but he ſayd vnto her: Madame, I beſeech you before I ſpake vnto you, cauſe to be brought hither ſome ſtraw with fier; which hauing don, he willed her to putt the ſtraw &amp; the fier together, the lady hauing ſo dō theA Religious ought to shunne women▪
                      ſtraw preſētly burned, the Religious then ſayd vnto her: Madame, what iſſue you haue ſeene the ſtraw to haue with the fier, the like, belieue me hath the ſeruant of God with a woman ſpeaking with her without neceſsity. Whereat this lady was ſo ſhamefully amazed, that leauing this good Religious, ſhe neuer more inſinuated herſelfe by her curious deuotion to trouble him. Wherfore as this holy Religious perſeuered in vertues, ſo att the end of his life, his dead

body was endowed with ſuch a beauty and ſplendour, that all the Religious both admired and reioyced exceedingly, therby hauing more perfect aſſurance of his ſanctity. Att the inſtant of his death, S. Antony of Padua, who then was Canon Reguler in the monaſtery of S. Croſſe in Conimbria, celebrating the maſſe, ſaw in ſpirit the ſoule of this Religious mount into the aire, and gloriously to aſcend into Paradiſe; hauing firſt paſſed Purgatory, as a bird that flyeth ſwiftly.
               
               
                  Of the life, ſanctity, death and miracles of Br. Walter, and of the ancient custome of Portugall, to record matters that happened, by the yeares of Auguſtus Caeſar.
                  THE XXX. CHAPTER.
                  THe vertue and ſanctity of Br. Walter, diſciple of S. Francis are yet of great fame, he hauing ſo piously and exemplarly liued, that in a ſhort time he drew al the neighbour contrye to be friendes to his Order; he alſo conuerted them from many vices and ſinnes wherto the inhabitantes therof were much enclined and addicted, and exerciſed them in vertues. It is ſayd that this holy Father being dead and enterred, there iſſued out of his tombe an oyle of ſuch vertue as it cured many diſeaſes, and perſeuered till his body was tranſported to the great Couent neere to the ſaid citty. The day of his death, which was the ſecond of Auguſt, was a long time feſtiually ſolemniſed; and in regard of the great concourſe of people that from euery where repayred thither, to honour and reuerence the holy reliques, there was kept a generall faire. A long time after, the Frere Minors hauing built their CouentThe body of Br. Walter could not be lifted. very neere the citty, the Canons reſolued to ſteale from them this holy body: but though to this purpoſe they came thither with a great nomber of men, and afterwardes with ſtrength of oxen to draw away the tombe of the ſayd S. entier: neuertheles they could not ſo much as lift vp the reliques alone out of the tombe, by what ſoeuer forcible endeauour, nor much leſſe remoue the tombe from his place, notwithſtanding the force of the oxen: ſo that att length perceauing the miracle, and that neither the will of God, nor of the S. was, that they ſhould committ this theft, they full of ſhame and confuſion departed, yet for this reſpect they had the S. in greater reuerence, though they went away much diſcontented. The Religious hauing the next morning vnderſtood all the matter, they went to the tombe, whence, without any impediment they tooke the ſacred reliques, and carryed them to their new Couent: and they that did accompany them did exceedinglie admire to ſee, that aſſoone as they put their hādes into the tombe to ſeeke for the reliques,

they tooke them out without any difficulty, which ſo many men and oxen together could not doe before. Thus was this holy body placed in the Church of S. Frācis att Guimarames, where it is exceedingly reuerē
                     ced of the inhabitantes, who in their ſickneſſe and neceſsities accuſtome to recommend themſelues vnto him, and of deuotion to take of the earth of his ſepulcher: they haue alſo great experience of his merittes with God, by the fauours and graces which they daily by his interceſsiō receaue of his diuine maieſty. The three firſt monaſteries of the FrereThe original of the firſt monaſtery of the Frere Minors in Portugal. Minors in the kingdome of Portugall, were thoſe of Lisbone, of Guimarames, and of Alenquer, two of the which were tranſported to the citty of Guimarames, as hath bin ſayd, and euen the Oratory of Alenquer, as well in regard itt ſtood in an euill ayre, as for the deuotion of the Princeſſe Saucia, was alſs chaunged and accommodated in the Pallace where her ſelfe dwelt, vpon the Mount nere vnto the Citty, and the third which is att Lisbone, is not ſo neere the Citty as the others. There is nothing found in the ancient Chronicles, touching the firſt Religious of this monaſtery, but there is an epitaph in the firſt cloyſter of the ſayd Couent of S. Francis att Lisbone, wherby appeareth when this monaſtery, of litle and humble as it was in the beginning, was made ſo ſumptuous as it is: for the writing and inſcription of the epitaph is ſuch: In the honour of the ſoueraine Monarch, of the glorions Virgin Mary, and of the glorious paranymph Gabriel tharchangel: Iohn Moguephi, Secretary &amp; treaſuror of the noble kinge of Portugall, hath erected thīs Cloiſter, this church, and this Chapter; his ſoule reſt in peace. This epitaph was written the yeare 1310. out of which nomber taking thirthy eight yeares, which the Emperour Auguſtus regned then from the incarnatiō of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, (for the Portugals then counted, asIn Portugall theyeares were heretofore counted by the yeare of the Emperour. a long time after by the yeares of Auguſtus) would remayne 1272. from the Natiuity of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST. He that will read this epitaph ſhal finde it at the diſcent of the ſtaires that goe frō the gate of the Couent to the Cloiſter on the left hād. It is ſayd that the Church was built by the people of Lisbone, in which time was alſo one of the firſt monaſteryes of the Frere Minors in Portugall, called S. Antony neere vnto thē Citty of Conimbria, wherin the glorious S. Antony of Lisbone denominated of Padua, tooke the habitt and there reſided ſome time, till he departed with intention to gett martyrdome. But it is not iuſtified wherfore the Religious approched ſo neere to the Citty, where to this preſēt they haue a great Couēt; but it is the foundation of a chappell called S. Antony, which the Citty in honour of him erected. Neere vnto it there was a very litle cell of earth, whervnto the people had great deuotiō, becauſe it was ſayd that S. Antony had formerly dwelt therin, but it was ruinated to build in that place the Monaſtery of the Frere Minors,

of the Prouince of la Pieté in inuocation of ſainct Antony. This place where the ſayd cell was, is yet to this preſent the Chapter.
               
               
                  The life of Brother Angelus of Piſa, a Religious of worthy ſanctitie.
                  Now Brother Angelus of Piſa, was ſent with Brother Albert of Piſa alſo by the Father S. Francis into England, and of the ill entertainement they receiued of a Priour of S. Benets Order.
                  THE XXXI. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Angelus of Piſa was a Religious of worthie ſanctity, who hauing founded the monaſtery of Piſa where he was Guardian, and as other affirme, after he had began the Couent att Patis, was by the holy Father ſainct Francis in the generall diuiſion made the yeare 1219. ſent into England, and with him went Brother Albert of Piſa, who afterwardes was Generall, and ſome other Religious giuen him for companions, by their doctrine &amp; good examples to edifie ſoules in IESVS CHRIST; and alſo there to found monaſteries of Frere Minors. The third of May then theſe good Religious arriued in Englād, and went to Canterbury, where they were cuteously entertayned by the Dominicans who had already a monaſtery there; thence they went farther to haue ſpeech with the king, who was a very good Catholike, and fauoured all vertuous deſsignes, and therfore they proceeded on towardes Oxford, and in the way they came to a Monaſtery of Religious of ſainct Benedict before Arabud, ſcituat in the middeſt of a great mountaine, betweene Oxford and London, the night and aboundance of raine preuenting them of trauilling further, and being withall cold, and hauing nothing to eat, they there demaunded of thoſe Religious for the loue of God entertainement for that night, as well in regard of their wearines, as of the raine and cold that hindred their farther trauell. The Porter ſeeing theſe men clothed in vnuſuall attire and to ſpeake a ſtrange language, preſently iudged them to be ſycophants and ſporting companions to gett their commons, and therfore inſtantly aduertiſed the Priour of them; who was diſcourſing with his Relligious, among whome were the Sacriſtine, the Steward, and a yong Religious. He commanded the Porther to bring them in, with intention to recreat himſelfe in ſeeing them play ſome ſportes or trickes to content his Religious. The Frere Minors comming before them, were willed to ſhew ſome paſſetime to the company. Whereto they very humbly anſweared

that they were not Players or ſportmakers, but Religious profeſſours of the goſpell: The Priour moued with this anſweare, belieuing them to be indeed Ieaſters, commanded them with many mockeries and diriſions to be incontinently and rudely thruſt out of the dores. But the yong Religious man perceauing the proud commandement of the Priour, hauing great compaſsion of thoſe poore barefoot and halfe naked creatures, ſo entreated the Porter, that he perſuaded him for the loue of God to permitt the poore ſtrangers to enter in, when the Priour ſhould be retired, and to lodge them ſecretly in ſtraw in the ſtable: which he did, and that Religious carryed them bread and beere: and ſo recommending himſelfe to their prayers, he retourned to his cell.
               
               
                  How the ſaid Priour was ſeuerily punished of God, and alſo the other two Religious that were with him, for the diſcurtiſie vſed towardes his ſeruantes.
                  THE XXXII. CHAPTER.
                  THe ſame night the yong Religious that had done that charity to the poore Frere Minors sleeping, ſaw in a dreame, IESVS CHRIST ſitting on a merueillous throne, who calling them all to iudgement, ſayd with a terrible voice: Bring forth the Priour and the Religious of this place, and they being inſtantly preſented vnto him, there came on the other ſide a contemptible poore man, cloathed as the Religious that were thruſt out of the ſaid Couent, who complayningly with a loud voice and great feruour ſaid to IESVS CHRIST. Moſt iuſt iudge, he bloud of the Frere Minors cryeth before thy diuine Maieſty, which this night hath bin ſhed by theſe Religious, that would not afford them lodgeing and refection in ſuch neceſsitie and extreme perill: theſe poore Frere Minors hauing left all thy had for thy loue and goeing into England expresly to procure the ſaluation of ſoules redeemed by thy precious bloud, denying them that which they would haue giuē them if they had bin paraſites and ſportmakers. IESVS CHRIST then with a terrible voice ſayd to the Priour: Of what Order art thou? OfS. Benedict, anſweared he: IESVS CHRIST tourning towardes S. Benett, asked him if it were true, that he was one of his Religious: the Sainct anſweared: Lord this is a deſtroyer of my religion, as are alſo his companions, for my rule commandeth that the Abbots table be common to ſtraungers in neceſsitie, and theſe haue alwayes denyed thinges neceſſary to the poore.

then condemned to death the Priour, the Stewerd, and the Sacriſtine▪ and then he tourned to the Religious that had this viſion, and had bin benefactour to the Frere Minors, and ſayd: And thou, of what Order art thou? he quaking and trembling for feare to heare ſentence againſt himſelfe, hauing ſeene S. Benett aduerſe to his Religious, anſweared: Lord, I am of the Order of this thy poore ſeruant (meaning S. Francis) of whome IESVS CHRIST demaunded if it were true that this Religious was of his Order: he anſweared that he was, and that he had alredy admitted him: and then very graciously embraced him, and therwith he awaked vtterly amazed and trembling att this fearfull viſion. And ariſing from his bed, he preſently went to the cell of his Priour to relate him all: and entring in, he found him ſtrangled in his bed, hauing ſo deformed &amp; hideous a face, as procured a horrour to the beholders.

This made him almoſt beſides himſelfe with care to find out the Frere Minors. But the porter had diſmiſſed them for feare of the Priour, ſo that this yong Religious ſought out his Abbot, to whome he recounted this chaſticement inflicted by God on his Religious, which was inſtantly diuulged throughout all that contry, where this yong Religious was the fiſt that became a Frere Minour: and Br. Angelus and his companions were with great charity receaued by the king of England into the citty of Oxford.
               
               
                  How Br. Angelus cauſed Couents to be builded att Oxford and other where: of his humilitie, and of his death.
                  THE XXXIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe kink preſently appointed them a place neere the walles of the citty, and not farre from his pallace, there to build them a Couent, permitting them to breake the ſaid wall for the better commodity of their building: He alſo permitted them to ſhutt vp a ſtreet that went from the ſame place to S. Fredeſmond, that they might be the more retired, leauing only one gate for the king to enter att his pleaſure. Now the fruit that theſe Religious wrought there, was ſuch, that not only the great and notorious ſinners, recalled themſelues: but euen many gentlemen were conuerted and left the world, to follow that Apoſtolique life which thoſe Frere Minors profeſſed, among whome one was Don. Ridolfo a Biſhop, who in a viſion ſeeing S. Francis with his companions on the right ſide of our Lord, ſoueraigne Iudge, to iudge men, he forſooke his biſhopprick and the world, by permiſsiō
                     
of Pope Gregorie the ninth; and became a Frere Minor: as alſo did an Abbot, who together tooke the habitt and liued in Religion with ſuch humility, that they gaue euident demonſtration to be true contemners of worldly dignities. When their monaſtery was builded they carryed on their backes, ſtones, lime, &amp; whatſoeuer was needfull to the worckmen. This firſt prouinciall of England hauing admitted into the Order many yong men, he erected and conſtituted a place of ſtudy, that the Brethren profiting in learning, might alſo in time benefitt in the gayning of ſoules: and to that end he prayed maſter Robert of Oſſe, Doctour in diuinity to aſsiſt in gouernmēt of the ſchoole of the Religious; which the Doctour with great deuotion accorded vnto, and offered to direct &amp; gouerue them till they had a Religious that could read vnto them. But Br. Angelus retourning one day frō viſiting ſome other monaſteries which he had erected in the ſame Prouince, he thought good to examine the progreſſe of theſe yong Religious in their ſtudy, and hearing them diſpute of curious and friuolous queſtions, he began to cry out: O miſerable wretch that I am what haue I done? ſith the ſimple and idiotes are rauiſhed in God, and theſe my Religious with their learning call in queſtion, if there be a God: And att the very hower diſſolued and diſcontinued the ſtudy, being of opinion that it hindered the repoſe of the ſpiritt.
                  This holy Religious was endued with a profound humility, which made him very gratefull to God and men: It is recorded of him that he would neuer accept the Order of Prieſthood till he was conſtrayned by a Generall Chapter: Att length the day after the feaſt of S. Gregory, the Pope, he yelded his ſpiritt vnto God. After his death he wrought many miracles, as he had done alſo in his life time. He was buryed in the Couent of the Frere Minors in the citty of Oxforde, in a coffin of wood, to place him afterward in ſome honorable ſepulcher. Certaine yeares after the people made him a ſepulcher of marble, into which attempting to put him, they found in his coffin a liquor like vnto oyle ſauouring as baulme; which was his very fleſh in that ſort melted and diſſolued: his precious bones did ſwimme on the ſaid oyle. The Religious hauing inconſideratly handled the ſaid coffin, thincking to remoue it, the bottome fell to the ground, and that precious liquour ran out with all, yelding to thoſe preſent ſo delicious a ſauour, that it gaue them all comfort and conſolation: and ſo his bones reſted in the new ſepulcher, and the ſayd oyle was withall care poſsible gathered vp: and therwith were cured many infirmities.

                  BRother Ambroſe was from his birth ſo beloued of the diuine maieſtie, that albeit he conuerſed among worldly men euen to his complet age, yet was he by a ſpeciall grace of God alwayes preſerued from vices and ſinnes: but being by his eternall maieſty induced to ſhunne the ſnares of the deuill, hauing, for the loue of IESVS CHRIST giuen all he had to the poore, he in the time of Sainct Francis became a Frere Minor; and hauing obtayned of God the grace of contemplation and Euangelicall perfection, he withall his iuduſtry laboured, that the ſame might not

In the moſt violent and extremeſt cold, being almoſt naked, he trauelled for the neceſsities of the Religious, he continuallie employed himſelfe in prayer, dailie examining his conſcience, for the moſt part his reliefe was only bread and water with abondance of teares, and by ſuch like abſtinence, he mortified the concupiſcences of his fleſh, to be able with more puritie to offer vp his ſoule in ſacrifice vnto God. He was exceeding compaſsionate vnto afflicted perſonnes, and with alacrity ſerued the ſicke, not only Religious, but the ſeculer alſo; If there wanted phiſike he demaunded it for the loue of God, as alſo all other thinges neceſſarie: he was very humble, and therfore deſirously laboured in the kitchen, waſhed the diſhes, ſwept the houſe, and very willingly buſied himſelfe in all other offices of humility. If by any word or act he had giuen occaſion of troubles to any one, he would preſently put a cord about his owne neck and ſo goe aske him pardon, though he endured iniuryes done to himſelfe as patiently as if no ſuch thinge had bin: he liued fifteene yeares in ſuch and the like exerciſes of vertue; and afterwardes in his death and ſince, God hath diſcouered how gratefull the life of this his ſeruant was vnto him: before his laſt ſicknes he reuealed the day of his death and the place, which he declared to one of his companions. He trauelled to Ciuitadochia, where being arriued, he fell ſick, and few dayes after the terme of his life being exſpired, one night att mattins he ſhewed ſuch an extraordinary ioyfull face, as if he had ſome viſion, that made him euen exteriourly to reioyce.

Wherfore the Religious that attended him, demaunded if he had ſeene any Angell of heauen, or the holy Father Sainct Francis, he anſweared that he had not ſeene the holy Father S. Francis, but of the Angel he ſayd nothing. Being in thoſe ioyes, he aduertiſed his companions of the death of one deuoted vnto him which was reuealed vnto him, ſaying that William was already departed out of this world vnto almighty God, and that himſelfe ſhould follow him the ſame day betweene none and euenſonge, which came to paſſe: for att the time foretold this holy Religious Ambroſe yelded his ſoule into the handes of his Creatour.

                  THE XXXV. CHAPTER.
                  THe nomber of miracles, by which our Lord would approue the life and ſanctity of his ſeruant, Brother Ambroſe; was ſuch, that Pope Gregory the ninth by an Apoſtolicall breuie commanded the Biſhop of Ciuitadochia, and the Priour of S. Iohn of the Order of S. Auguſtin to meet, and to examine the life and miracles of the S. and hauing peruſed them to approue them for autenticall. This Briefe was giuen att the Palace of Lateran, the 13. yeare of his Popedome, by vertue wherof the ſaid Prelates hauing made a moſt dilligent ſearch, they found that fourteene lame perſons had by the merittes of this ſeruant of God bin cured, as alſo foure deliuered of the falling ſickneſſe, one diſpoſſeſſed in his life time, and two after his death, ſix cured of mortall impoſtumes, and one of a fiſtula. He reſtored hearing to one that was deafe, four men were cured of ſeuerall diſeaſes, a woman of the bloudie flux, and an other whoſe child had bin foure monethes dead in her wombe: he reſtored ſight to foure that were blind, and finally rayſed many from death. The ſaid Prelates tooke notice of theſe and many other miracles: but the death of the Pope peruerted his inſcription in the catalogue of the SS. in the Church militant, though he were recorded in heauen, where he raigneth with IESVS CHRIST in his Church triumphant, making ſupplication to his diuine maieſty, for thoſe that in their neceſsities haue recourſe vnto him.

Of the exemplare humilitie and ſinguler patience of Brother Iuniperus.
                  THE XXXVI. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Iuniperus was one of the firſt and moſt perfect diſciples of S. Francis: for he was ſo grounded in the firme and aſſured foundations of humility, patience, contempt of the world and of himſelfe, that no tormenting temptations of the deuill, nor perſecution of the world could in any ſort remoue or deſioyne him from his eſtate of perfection, There was neuer any that ſaw him troubled or diſquieted, ſo couragiously did he ſupport all iniuryes of wordes or actions: Which brought him to ſuch miſpriſe of himſelfe, that many ſeeing him in ſuch poore apparance and ſo ill treated, not knowing his perfection, eſteemed him for a foole and ſenceleſſe: But S. Francis that knew him right well, reputing him in the nomber of the perfect, ſayd, that he ſhould be a good and true Frere Minor, that attayned the miſpriſe of the world and of himſelfe, ſo far foorth as had done Brother Iuniperus: and oftentimes conſidering his ſimplicities, the contempt of himſelfe, and patience in reprehenſions giuen him, he would ſay to the Religious preſent: My Brethren, I deſire, and would to God I had a great forreſt full of ſuch Iunipers. This worthy ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST oftentimes found new occaſions for exerciſe of his patience to be miſpriſed and reproached, yet without offending God, neuer ſhunning to be reputed a foole: as when he one time entred into the citty of Viterbium, hauing made a fardell of his habitt bound vp with his cord which he carryed on his ſhoulders and ſo went into the marckett place, where the children ſeeing him almoſt naked, vſed him as a foole, reuiled him with wordes, caſt ſtones att him, and berayed him with filth. After he had left theſe that thus tormented him, he went to the Couent, where the Religious ſeeing him in ſuch pittifull eſtate, and vnderſtanding by him wherefore he had bin ſo handled, they were much ſcandalized att what he had don, and tooke it in very ill part, bitterly reprehending him for it: ſome told him he deſerued to be cudgelled, others, to be impriſonned, others, to be hanged, for the great ſcandall he had giuen to the people: but he accepted all theſe indignities with a very contented and ioyfull countenance, as matter much deſired of him: and in ſignification of the interiour contentment he conceaued, he tooke the fore part of his habitt, and beholding thoſe Religious that were moſt offended with his fact, and rebuked him for it, ſayd vnto thē, My freindes, fill this I pray you with theſe iewels: doe ſo, feare not, for I receaue them as precious ſtones and iewels that cannot be ſufficiently

eſteemed. So called he the affrontes and iniuries done vnto him precious ſtones and of notable value with God.
                  An other time being in the citty of Spoletum, he vnderſtood that there was a feaſt to be ſolemniſed att Aſsiſium, whither would repaire from moſt parts of the world; &amp; nott minding too looſe the gaine he hoped to make there, he determined to goe to the feaſt in the faſhion aforeſaid, and being in the citty, he went, expresly to be ſeene and the more to be meſpriſed of the people, into the principall ſtreetes: which was preſently related to his Brethren, as he well expected. Wherfore being come to the monaſtery, they all chardged him with notable iniuryes, calling him foole, and worthy to be layd in irons, for diſhonouring their houſe and Religion: all concluding that he deſerued a great penance: Wherevpon, the Guardian, hauing before all the company giuen him a rough and rude chapter, ſayd vnto him: O miſerable wretch! what pennance can I impoſe on thee correſpondent and worthy the exceſſe of thy notorious fact: Herevnto Brother Iuniperus very humbly auſweared: Father the correction you ſhould giue me is, to permitt me to retourne in the ſame manner I came, and the ſame way. Herbie the Religious vnderſtood well what had bin the cauſe of his comming, and being qualified and appeaſed, they pray7s;ed God for it.
               
               
                  How Brother Iuniperus abhorred honours, and conſolations.
                  THE XXXVII. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Iuniperus being ſent to Rome there to remayne, where the reputation of his vertues liued, ſome that were deere freindes to him and deuoted to the Order, vnderſtanding therof, went out of the citty to meet him, ſo to entertayne him curteously and to honour him. But this holy Religious ſeeing them comming, and ſuſpecting the occaſion, which he extremely deteſted and ſhunned, he was att the firſt apprehenſion exceedingly troubled to reſolue on ſome meane to auoyd that honour. Att lēght after he had ſome time diſcourſed in his ſpiritt of this ſubiect, ſtill goeing on his way, he found children buſyed in this ſport following: they had layd a peice of wood croſſe vpō a wall, att each end wherof was a boy ſitting aſtride, who by equall waight did alternatiuely mount each other vp and downe. Brother Iuniperus gott one of the places and began to ſport with the boy att the other end. His freindes and affectionat, comming there, did not yet forbeare very reuerently to ſalute him, well knowing his faſhions and cuſtomes: but he perſiſting firme and conſtant in his purpoſe, would

not ſeeme to ſee or heare them, ſo atttentiue did he appeare in that ſport; and ſo long he continued and ſo reſolutely, that trying their patience, he enforced them att laſt to retourne home much diſcontented and diſedifyed att the inciuillytie and folly of their freind; and afterwardes he ſecrecretly slipt into his Couent, very ioyfull in hauing ſo auoyded the vaineglory of that worldly entertainement.
                  An other time he hauing bin againſt his will commanded to goe to the houſe of a gentleman that deſired much to diſcourſe particulerly with him, he was thervnto conſtrayned by obedience: but by whatſoeuer meanes the gentleman could deuiſe to occaſion him to diſcourſe, he could not wreſt ſo much as one good word from him. Yet ſuppoſing him to be weary or diſtempered with ſome indiſpoſition, he for that night conducted him into a chamber very commodiously furniſhed for his repoſe: but very early the next morning, without ſpeaking a word to any perſon he departed, leauing the bed and other furniture diſorderly and confuſedly heaped together, to be eſteemed a foole. Which the gentleman hauing ſeene, he was exceedingly confounded and ſcandelized att this Religious, that thus diſgraced him: and complayned therof to the other Religious, who exceedingly checked him for it. And then in their preſence he reprehended himſelfe, acknowledgeing that he did not only deſerue to be rebuked, but alſo to be ſeuerely puniſhed.
                  Brother Iuniperus diſcourſing one time with ſome Religious touching death, one of them ſaid: God graunt, me the grace to dye in ſome Couent of the Order, in the company of my Brethren, that my ſoule may be comforted, and aſsiſted by their prayers, and that my body may be buryed with other Religious. Herevpon Brother Iuniperus tooke occaſion of ſpeech ſaying; &amp; I would that at the houre of my death my body might be ſo loathſome and ſtinking, that no Religious would aduenture to come neere it: but that they would therfore caſt me into ſome priuie or ſmoke, and there leaue me as moſt abhominable: and afterwardes being dead would not aforde me any buryall, but that foules might deuour my body.
                  The humility of this holy Religious was ſo admirable, as alſo his deſire to be miſpriſed for the loue of IESS CHRIST, that he could neuer eſteeme himſelfe in any ſort ſufficiently burdened with reproches, iniuryes, vilainies, and infamies, in his life and in his death. In which repect, we may iuſtly ſay: Non est inuentus ſimilis illi, that more preciſely then he obſerued to repay this law vnto our Lord, in the ſame mony and coyne of reproches as he ſuffered for vs, and with ſuch 
                        •

                  Of the remedy which Brother Iuniperus vſed, againſt the temptations of ſenſuality.
                  THE XXXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Giles, Brother Ruffinus, Brother Simon, and Brother Iuniperus, being on time together in ſpirituall conference and conuerſation, Brother Giles ſayd to the reſt: My Brethren, I beſeech you tell me, how you arme your ſelues againſt the temptations of ſenſuality. Br. Simon of Aſsium anſweared: I conſider the loathſomnes of this ſinne, &amp; how deteſtable it is, not only in the preſence of God, but euen before men, who though impious, yet ſeeke to conceale and couer themſelues from being ſeene in the exerciſe of ſuch a filthy act. This conſideration procureth in me a diſpleaſure and deteſtation of this ſinne, and deliuereth me of the temptation. Then Brother Ruffinus ſpake as thus: For my part, when I am tempted with that ſinne, I fall on both my knees vpon the ground, I implore the aſsiſtance of the diuine clemencie, and of the glorious Virgin Mother, and ſo continue in prayer till I feele my ſelfe freed. Brother Iuniperus then ſpake to this purpoſe: When I perceaue ſuch diueliſh temptations are repreſented to my ſenſes forcibly to aſſault me, I inſtanly ſhut the gates of my hart, whereto I conſtitue for ſeuere guardes, holy meditations and pious deſires, for ſecurity of the caſtell wherin reſideth the ſoule: and when their ennemies make their approches to giue an aſſault to that place, I, that command in that fortereſſe, cry to them from within: Goe your wayes, gett yee gone, the place is poſſeſſed for others; yee are diſcouered, I am fortified with whatſoeuer is neceſſary to giue you repulſe: In this manner doe I euer preſerue my fortereſſe from being ſurpriſed by ſuch baſe companions, who by their entry would vtterly ruinate me: or att leaſt it would be very difficult for me to expell them, for att the inſtant that I perceaue them ready to aſſault me, without permitting them to lay their ſiege, I enforce them to retire with ſhame enough. Which Brother Giles vnderſtanding he tourned to his companions, and ſayd: Brethren, I am of Brother Iuniperus opinion, &amp; reſolue hēceforward to make vſe of his ſtratageme of warre; for it is moſt certaine; conſidering that in this ſinne the ſecureſt fight is to fly; by reaſon that the traiterous appetite which is within the fleſh, findeth ſuch a ſtrōge concurrence of aſsiſtāce in the exteriour ſences by an army rayſed

by the deuill, and oppoſed againſt the ſoule, that the perill is extreme and the victory vncertaine, ſo that the ſecureſt is, not to permitt this traiterous domeſticall ſinne to enter into our hart.
                  Iuniperus being one time reprehended for hauing ſpoaken too lightly, the mouth being the dore wherat the ſpiritt of deuotion and prayer goeth out, he continued ſix entiere monthes in perpetuall ſilence: the firſt day his purpoſe not to ſpeake was in honour of God the Father, the ſecond for reuerence of the Sonne, the third for loue of the holy Ghoſt, the fourth for the Queene of heauen, and ſo each day propoſing ſome ſaincte, he ſtrictly obſerued his ſilence all that time with new feruour and deuotiō, though naturally he ſpake very litle, which alſo was of ſpirituall thinges, for as he could not endure to be flattered, ſo neither could he flatter, and ſo had no other diſcourſe but of God, and as a Religious perfect in humility, he would rather learne and heare, then with wordes and exteriour ſignes of ſanctity teach others.
               
               
                  Of the great charity which Br. Iuniperus exerciſed towards the ſick.
                  THE XXXIX. CHAPTER.
                  THis glorious S. had a great affection to the ſick, and with an extreme charity did deſirously ſerue them: by meanes wherof happened a ſtrange accident att our Lady of Angels touching a ſicke perſon, of whome by order of S. Francis who then was there, he had the chardge. This poore ſick man was by the continuance of his infirmity become ſo feeble, that he had not ſo much ſtrength as to eat, which would infallibly haſten his death: Br. Iuniperus hauing great cō
                     paſsiō of him, prayed him with tearfull eyes to tell him wherof he could willinglie ear, and he would procure it for him. The ſick party anſweared that he thought he could well eat of a hogs foote in Vinegar, if he could gett it. Br. Iuniperus replyed: be of good Courage Brother, I will preſently bring you one dreſſed as you deſire, and taking a great knife out of the kitchen, he went out of the houſe, and ſeeing many hogges feeding in a field neere by, he ran ſo fa
                        •
                     t after them, that he gott one and cutt off his foot, and therwith retourned to the Couent, where he preſently dreſſed it with vinegar: then carrying it to the ſick, he did eat therof with ſuch appetite and courage, that recouering his taſt and appetite he began to amend: and by this meane eſcaped for that time the danger of death. In the meane time the maſter of the hogges being by his ſwineheard aduertiſed, that a Frere Minor had cutt off the foot of one of his hogges, he, puffed vp with choller went haſtely to the Couent, where exclaming as a maded man, he vttered many iniurious ſpeeches

to the Religious: and ſo farre was he tranſported with fury that he diſgordged againſt them a thouſand vilanies. Which the holy Father S. Francis vnderſtanding, he went to him and ſought to appeaſe him, praying him for the loue of God to haue patience, and offred to repaire whatſoeuer dommage he had receaued. But the man, more poſſeſſed with deſpight then with the loſſe, would heare no propoſition: but wēt away exceedingly ſcandalized att the Religious, of whome he bruted many lyes through the ſtreetes, and very ſeriously and vehemently threatned them. Theſe good Religious were in meane while exceedingly greiued att this accident, and knew not the cauſe therof: wherfore hauing long time diſcourſed vpon it among themſelues, they att length addreſſed themſelues to Br. Iuniperus, ſuſpecting that his ſimplicity and ſome indiſcreet zeale had moued him to this fact. But he reſpecting only God, contemned all thoſe toyes and reſpectes of the world. The holy Father S. Francis called him before him to vnderſtand the matter and circumſtances: and he very ioyfully recounted vnto him, that God had directed and ſent vnto him that hogge for the cure of the poore ſicke Brother. Sainct Francis exceedingly admiring ſayd vnto him: Ah Brother Iuniperus, you haue this day cauſed a great ſcandall: for the maſter of the hogge hath bin here and in all fury hath giuen vs infinite reproaches: but I acknowledge that he hath reaſon, and doe feare he will defame vs ouer all the citty. Wherfore I command you vpon obedience to run after him, to aske him pardon, and to aſſure him that he ſhalbe ſatisfied for his loſſe, and eſpecially ſo to deale with him as he be not ſcandalized att vs. Brother Iuniperus much admiring that any one ſhould be moued to choller vpon ſo charitable a worck, conſidering it to be apparant, that temporall goodes are giue of God but for vſe of charity, he anſweared: Doubt not Father but I will preſentlie appeaſe him: in ſuch ſort as he ſhalle haue no cauſe to complaine of ſuch a charity done, as more concerneth God then himſelfe. Which ſayd, he went in great haſt to ſeeke out the maſter of the hogge, whome hauing found full of choller, he related vnto him how and for what cauſe he had cutt off his hogges foot: then added that he ought to thanck him, becauſe thereby he had giuen him occaſion of meritt in an act ſo pleaſing vnto God as by his meane was accompliſhed. In meane while the man abuſed him and grew into ſuch fury, as he was euen ready to ſtrike him: but the good Religious fell at his feet, embraced him, and beſought him for the loue of God to pardon him: which manner of proceeding ſo mollified his hart, that hauing apparantlie ſeene and perceaued his ſimplicity, and that what he had done proceeded merely of charitie, and not of malice, or to doe him a miſchiefe, as the deuill had

put in his head, he entred into himſelfe, and repented that euer he had iniuryed the Religious and asked them pardon, acknowledging himſelfe auaricious and ingratefull for the benefittes he had receiued of God: in ſatisfaction wherof, he preſentlie killed the hogge: and cauſing him to be conueniently dreſſed, he ſent him to the Religious, that for the verie loue of God they might eat him in ſatisfaction of the iniuries vttered againſt them: and thenceforward was very deuout and liberall to the poore of IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  How Brother Iuniperus gaue all he had, and could haue for the loue of God.
                  THE XL. CHAPTER.
                  THis holy Religious was ſo compaſsionate of the poore, that when he mett any poorely cloathed, he would rip off part of his habitt and giue him: and becauſe he did thus often, and retourned to the Couent halfe naked, his Guardian commanded him vpon obedience no more to giue his habitt nor part therof. After this commandement meeting a poore wretched creature that asked an almoſe of him: he, moued with compaſsion, ſayd: I haue nothing to giue thee but this habitt: but I am forbidden vpon obedience to giue it to any: yet if thou wilt take it from me, I promiſe thee I will not hinder nor reſiſt thee. The poore man vnderſtanding theſe wordes, tooke off his habitt, and left him almoſt naked: ſo retourning to his Couent, he told the Religious that a poore man had taken his habitt from him: for which his Guardian knew not what to ſay vnto him. Now the thirſt of charitable worckes being vnquencheable in the ſeruante of God, this thirſt of pittie and compaſsion ſo encreaſed in Brother Iuniperus, that he did not only giue to the poore his habittes: but alſo, the bookes, the ornamēts of the altare, &amp; the cloakes of his Brethren when he could gett them, and that occaſion was preſented: therfore when the Religious ſaw any poore demaunding almoſe of Brother Iuniperus, they would hide whatſoeuer was neceſſarie vnto them. It happened vpon one Chriſtmas day in the Couent of Aſsiſium, that the Sacriſtine goeing to eat, prayed Brother Iuniperus in the meane while to haue care of the altare: before which being in prayer, there came to him a poore old woman, demanding an almoſe for the loue of God: to whome Brother Iuniperus anſweared: Mother if you pleaſe to expect a litle, I will ſee if vpon this altare ſo richli
                        •
                     
                     
adorned, there be any thing ſuperfluous that I may giue you: and perceiuing ſiluer frenge vpon the ornament of the altare, he tooke his knife and ripped it off, and gaue it to the poore woman, it ſeeming to him more neceſſarie to cloath a liuing member of IESVS CHRIST then an altare of ſtone: though in the one and the other the intention be pious for the honour of God: He willed her preſently to depart for feare that the Sacriſtin comming ſhould take it from her. Wherin he did very well, for the Sacriſtin remembring the quality of Brother Iuniperus had ſcarce leaſure to eat two bittes, but he retourned in great haſt to the Church; where looking carefullie if any thinge wanted, he miſſed the frenge of the ornament: which much diſquieting him, he complayned to Brother Iuniperus, who anſweared: Brother be not troubled, I haue giuen it to a poore woman that was in extreme neceſsity. The Sacriſtine knowing that there was no meane to recouer it, went to complaine to the Generall, who then was Brother Iohn Parent, a very deuout Religious: who anſweared him, that the fault was his owne, ſith knowing the nature of Brother Iuniperus, he had left him to haue care of the altare: Yet intended to reprehend him, ſo to preuent the like an other time. He therfore did ſo chapter and check him publikelie in the refectory and with ſuch vehemence, that he got the rheume and poſe withall: which more grieued Brother Iuniperus then the reprehenſion giuen him. Now after he had bin thus humbled, he went into the citty to ſeeke ſome remedie for his Generall: and it being late before he went foorth, att his retourne to the Couent it was night, and the Generall was retired to his cell to repoſe. But Brother Iuniperus omitted not to goe and knock, praying him to ariſe and take the medicine he had brought him: and though the Generall diuers times with rude and ſharpe wordes reiected him, he neuertheles ſo long perſeuered, that his Generall att length ouercome by his charity, was enforced to open his dore and to take a pottage that he had brought him for phiſicke, which preſently cured him.
               
               
                  How Brother Iuniperus to confound the Religious of too much care for their food, dreſſed them att once enough for 15. dayes.
                  THE XLI. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Iuniperus was once in a certaine monaſtery, where all the Regilious goeing vpon occaſion abrod, he alone remayned in the

Couent to haue care of prouiding their ſupper, which he willingly vndertooke. Being then in his care of cookery, he began to conſider how much time was loſt in dreſsing of meat, and therfore bethought himſelfe and determined to confound them by a new practiſe: which was he preſently went into the citty where begging he got great prouiſion of fleſh, as of poultry, veale, mutton, and of cheeſe, egges, hearbes and pulſe of diuers ſortes. And hauing borrowed a great cawdron he retourned to the Couent, and putt whatſoeuer was giuen him into it, yea the poultry with their feathers, and putt much wood into the fier to haſten his cookery and to make his meat to boile quickly. Herevpon the Religious retourning from abroad, one of them went incontinently to the kichen, where ſeeing poore Brother Iuniperus all watered with ſweat, labouring exceedingly to farther their refection, with a great and lardge bord in forme of a skreene faſtened before him, to keepe himſelfe from ſcorching: and ſeeing ſo much fleſh, yea the poultry to ſwimme on that great boyling cawdron, he was ſo amazed, that without ſpeaking word he ran to fetch his brethren, who comming neere Brother Iuniperus, he ſayd vnto them: Be of courage Brethren, I haue here att once dreſſed you meat for fifteene dayes; that being ſufficiently refected, we may haue the more time to ſpend in prayer. Theſe wordes accompayned with the effect did ſo confound the Religious, that not knowing what to anſweare, they went and aduertiſed the Guardian of what Brother Iuniperus did and would doe, who willed him to be called, and ſharply reprehended him for this his folly and waſt of meat. But Brother Iuniperus falling to the ground with teares acknowledged, that he deſerued not only to be well reprehended, but to be hanged and hewed in peices, more then any malefactor whatſoeuer, ſith being in the world he had committed ſuch and ſuch ſinne: this he performed with ſuch humility and miſpriſe of himſelfe, that the Guardian full of admiration diſmiſſed him; and then to the Religious vſed theſe wordes: would to God Brother Iuniperus would euery day waſt as much meat as this day, on condition we might be ſo much edified therby as we are att this preſent.
               
               
                  How Brother Iuniperus was feared of the Deuils.
                  THE XLII. CHAPTER.
                  BY reaſon of the great humility and ſimplicity that was in Brother Iuniperus, the deuils could not endure the vertue of his prayer, yet leſſe his preſence. It once happpened that one poſſeſſed trauailling in the fieldes with ſome of his freindes, he att their vnawares eſcaped from them and ran more then two leagues, none of his company

hauing power to follow him. Hauing att length found him where he ſtayed, and hauing coniured him to tell the truth, and the cauſe of this his ſodaine and farre flight, he anſweared it was by reaſon of that great foole Brother Iuniperus that came the way directly towardes vs: for I cannot endure his preſence: they to know if this maſter lyer then ſpake the truth, did curiously ſearch, and found that Brother Iuniperus came that way they were to goe, ſo that if the poſſeſſed had no
                        •
                      fled, they had directly mett him. When the poſſeſſed perſonnes were brought to S. Francis if the deuill would not depart, he would thus threaten him: If thou doſt not preſently depart out of this body, I will ſend for Brother Iuniperus who ſhall chaſtice thee according to thy deſerts. The deuill fearing the preſence of this holy Religious, would preſently flye.
               
               
                  How the deuill attempting to be reuenged on Brother Iuniperus, did maliciously torment him and brought him euen to a gallowes, to hang him.
                  THE XXXXIII. CHAPTER.
                  THis great ſeruant of God was exceedinglie afflicted and tormented by the deuilles, according to their ancient cuſtome to aſſault and torment the humble, more then all other men, as thoſe whome they know to be moſt pleaſing vnto almighty God. And albeit we find not recorded the ſecrett and particuler temptations of this holy Religious; yet we cannot doubt but that he hath had exceeding great, ſith the deuilles for no other cauſe feared him, but in regard that he often vanquiſhed them: beſides it being manifeſtlie ſeene that he could neuer be wearied with iniuryes, the more eaſily by his patience to ſuppreſſe the pride and arrogancie of the deuill. Yet we obſerue a terrible temptation which the deuill weaued againſt him, which was ſuch as brought him euen to the gallowes ready to be hanged, hauing formerly bin cruelly tormented: wherby may be coniectured what his other temptations were. The matter was thus: Brother Iuniperus being to goe to a caſtell where there dwelt a noble man very euill minded in regard of his cruelties, called Nicolas, who warred againſt the inhabitants of Viterbium, the deuill transformed into the ſhape of a man, went to this noble man, and hauing drawen him a part as to diſcouer vnto him ſome ſecrett of importance, ſayd vnto him: My Lord I come to you as your ſeruant and friend to diſcouer vnto you that your ennemies of Viterbium haue concluded and determined your death in

this place and to fier it, that none of your people eſcape: and to this effect, they haue plotted with a man and committed the chardge vnto him, who is already in the way to attempt it. He is diſguiſed in this manner: his habitt is very baſe and contemptible, all tome, on his head he hath a capuce of diuers pieces and patches. Therfore command him to be brought before you, and you ſhall finde about him a long aule, wherwith to ſtabbe you, and a fier ſtone with maches to fier this caſtell. Which hauing vttered, he was no more ſeene by the noble man, whoſe cogitation was only vppon this aduertiſement, that did extremely trouble him, as hauing bin deliuered him by ſo excellent and perfect an Oratour: and he was therwith ſo terrified that he did ſhake and tremble with the feare. He foorthwith aduertiſed the guardes of his caſtell and others whome he ſent forth with charge if they found any ſuch and ſo attired, to apprehend him and warily to bring him to him. Now Brother Iuniperus according to the ſpeciall leaue he had, went alone, and in his way mett with yong idle companions, that as birdes wondred him and pulled him by the capuce, wherof they ſtill toare of ſome piece, ſo that by ſuch entreaty and his owne often giuing ſome litle piece to the poore, entring into the caſtell one would haue taken him neither for Religious nor lay perſon: and being knowne by the deſcription giuen of him, the guardes layd hold of him, and brought him before the noble man, who cauſed him to be ſearched, where was found about him the aule wherwith he ſowed his ſandales, and a fier ſteele, to ſtrict fier, when he was ſome time in the foreſtes in prayer. Being then found with thoſe inſtrumentes fitt to execute the practiſe wherof he was accuſed, they began to torment him, to enforce him to confeſſe who ſent him, and what he pretended to doe: conſidering withall the whole deſcription of the traytor was approued and confirmed in him. Firſt then his head was bound with groſſe cordes faſtened with two cudgels, in ſuch ſort as they forced and ſtrayned the naturall diſpoſition of the bones (this extreme torment ſo wrought, that during the reſt of his life he had neuer more the head ach) after that he had giuen him infinite ſtrappadoes. Being demaunded who he was, he anſweared that he was the greateſt ſinner in the world, and being asked if he came not thither to betray the caſtell, he anſweared that he was the greateſt traytor that was, being examined if he had not promiſed and reſolued to kill the Lord of the caſtell: he anſweared, that he ſhould doe wroſe, if God would permitt and abandon him. Wherevpon he was att length condemned to be drawne through the citty att a horſe taile, ſo to the place of execution to be hanged and ſtrangled. This worthy mirrour of patience Brother

Iuniperus, neuer alleadged one excuſe or reaſon to iuſtifieMore admirable then imitable patience of Br. Iuniperus. himſelfe, nor gaue no demonſtration of his diſquiett or vexation: but reſigning himſelfe entierly to the diuine prouidence, ſhewed in the middeſt of his torments a ioyfull and contented countenance. Now as all the people flocked together to ſee him trayned through the dirt, and conſequently to be hanged as a traytor, one of the miniſters of iuſtice, went incontinently to the Couent of the Frere Minors of the ſame Citty, and prayed the Guardian to haſten inſtantly for the reliefe and comfort of the ſoule of a miſerable malefactour that was conducted to his execution and death, yet neuertheles hath no apprehenſion of death, nor hath care or ſpeaketh att all of confeſsion. The Guardian ſpeedily haſtened to the place of execution, where finding &amp; knowing Brother Iuniperus, he began to weepe, and would haue put of his habitt to couer him, but he anſweared, that it was better to couer a poore liuing creature, then one dead, ſo litle was this holy Religious troubled with the tormentes paſt, the ignominie preſent, and the apprehenſion of death att hand: but he appeared ſo cheerfull and ſo pleaſant as if he had bin in a faire garden and plott of roſes, gilliflowers and other beautifull and ſweet flowers. Which the Guardian admiring, prayed the officers of iuſtice there preſent, to ſuſpend the execution of this criminell, till he had ſpoken with their Lord whoſe fauour he would craue in behalfe of him that he knew to be innocent, which they willingly promiſed. Comming then to the noble man, he thus ſpake vnto him: Know my Lord, the man whome you haue condemned to ſo ignominious a death, is one of the moſt perfect Religious of our Order of Frere Minors, and is called Brother Iuniperus. This extremely vexed this noble man, who by reputation knew Brother Iuniperus, hauing heard of his meruailes: wherfore he accompanied the Guardian, euen to the place of the citty where he was, and there fell on his knees before him, and bitterly weeping, beſought him before all the people to pardon him. The vertuous Religious did not only pardon him, but gaue him thanckes for being occaſion of his meritt towardes God, yea and thenceforwd he tooke it ſo gratefully, that remayning in the Couent of the ſaid place to cure and eaſe the torments he had endured, many honorable perſonnes preſenting him many ſmall commodities, he alwayes ſent the moſt worthie and excellent to the Earle, affirming that he did not acknowledge himſelfe more obliged to any man in the world then to him, becauſe he had not found any that had more accompliſhed his deſires then he. The earle, on the contrary ſaid, that he

knew therby that God would ſhortly end his enormous ſinnes, and that he ſhould not liue long, ſith he had ſo vnworthely tormented an innocent and ſo ſainct-like a man, though he knew him not, and that God would puniſh him for it. Wherin he was not deceaued, for a litle after he was slaine by his ennemies. Now this ſinguler fact may notifie vnto vs the patience of Brother Iuniperus, the excellencie of the vertues which God diſcouered in him, with what faith, hope, humility and fortitude he was armed, and the croſſe which he carryed in himſelfe, and wherin only he glorified, and the ſmall gaine the deuill gott of him in this combatt, where he was ſubdued by the patience of Brother Iuniperus, more like to that of IESVS CHRIST, then to that of Iob. Wherein appeareth how truly the holy Doctors affirme, that almighty God is ſuch a louer of our profitt and our glory, which is purchaced by labour in his ſeruice, that he denyeth it onlie to thoſe who make themſelues incapable to receaue it.
               
               
                  Of a Companion of Brother Iuniperus, and that was vnder his gouernement.
                  THE XLIV. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Iuniperus in his age had a companion, that was ſo obedient and of ſuch patience, that were he beaten and tormented a whole day together, he would neuer vtter a word of complaint. He was ſent to begge att their houſes who were knowne not to be charitable, but to be churliſh, ſcoffers, and iniurious to the Religious, whither he would willingly goe, and with an admirable patience ſupport the affrontes and iniuries offered vnto him. If Brother Iuniperus commanded him to weep, he would obey: if he commanded him to laugh, he would incontinently laugh. He being dead, Brother Iuniperus bitterly wept for this his deere companion, affirming that in this life there remayned vnto him nothing of worth, and that in the death of this Brother the world was as it were ruined, ſo much did he loue and eſteeme the vertue of the patience and mortification of this great ſeruant of God, and his foſter child.
               
               
                  
                  How Brother Iuniperus in prayer ſaw the glory of God, and of his death.
                  THE XLV. CHAPTER.
                  AFter the death of this Religious, the glorious Brother Iuniperus being very vigilant and feruent in prayer and deep contemplation, ſeemed to hate the world, and already to dye with deſire to goe to the other life, ſuch was his endeauour to aſcend vnto almighty God. Being one time in the quier att maſſe, he was ſo rapt in extaſie, that the ſeruice being ended, the Religious left him alone, where he ſo remayned a long time, and when he was retourned to himſelfe, he came to the Religious, to whome, with a notable feruour of ſpiritt, he vttered theſe wordes: Ah my Brethren, why doe not we conceaue a pleaſure to endure a litle labour and paine, to gaine eternall life? After that he vttered many thinges of high conſequence touching the humility, which deſerueth the glory of the elect. Theſe wordes gaue ſufficient cauſe to iudge, that he had had ſome communication of heauen. And in the end the true and worthie diſciple of ſainct Francis and ſingular freind of ſaincte Clare, who called him the paſſetime of IESVS CHRIST: becauſe ſhe found in him great conſolationBr. Iuniperus the paſstime of Ieſus Chriſt.
                      of ſpiritt, and would haue him neere att her death: this good and holy Religious, I ſay, after he had many yeares liued in great perfection in this deſert, paſſed from this life to the other, and was by almighty God tranſported into his glory. He was buryed att Rome in the Couent of Aracaeli.
               
               
                  The life of Brother Simon of Aſsiſium, the Diſciple of ſainct Francis
                  Of the holy conuerſation of Brother Simon.
                  THE XLVI. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Simon of Aſsiſium was called of God to holy Religion in the life time of S. Francis. This Religious was by the diuine Maieſty endwed with ſuch abondance of grace, and rayſed to ſuch a high degree of contemplation, that his whole life was a mirrour of ſanctity, and repreſented to all, the image of the bounty of God, according to the teſtimony of them that conuerſed with him. He rarely went out of his cell, and if ſometime he conuerſed with his brethren, his diſcourſe was altogether of God. He alwayes ſought ſolitary places:

and though he had neuer learned the grammer nor other humane ſciences, he neuertheles diſcourſed ſo ſublimely of God and of the moſt ſweet loue of IESVS CHRIST, that his wordes ſeemed rather Angelicall then humane. Brother Iames of Maſſa and ſome other Religious, went one euening with him into a wood to diſcourſe of almighty God, and Brother Simon ſo ſweetly diſcourſed of the diuine loue, that hauing ſpent all the night in that holy diſcourſe, and the breake of day alredy appearing, it ſeemed to them that he did but thē begin. When this Religious perceaued the comming of any diuine viſitation, he would caſt himſelfe on his bed as to sleep, or as ſicke of theCant. 5. diſeaſe of the Eſpouſe, who ſayth in the Canticles: Tell my beloued I languiſh for his loue. Sometimes in the ſaid diuine viſitations he was ſo eleuated in God, that he remayned inſenſible of worldly thinges: ſo that a Religious once deſiring to trye whiles he was in extaſie, if he had any feeling, tooke a burning coale, and putt it on his bare foot, wherewith he did not only not come to himſelfe, nor felt the heat of the fier, but the coale dyed on his foot, without leauing any ſigne of burning. The Sainct accuſtomed when he did eat with the Religious, to feed them ſpiritualy with the word of God before they receaued their corporall refection.
               
               
                  How Brother Simon deliuered a Nouice from the temptation of the flesh, and how the Nouice became perfect in charity and of his death.
                  THE XLVII. CHAPTER.
                  THis good Father diſcourſing one day of almighty God, with ſuch feruour declared the obligation which we haue to his diuine Maieſty and to our owne ſaluation, that a wordly yong man there preſent, reſolued to leaue the world and to become religious, (he was borne att Senſeuerin, a citty in the kingdome of Naples) &amp; foorthwith tooke the habitt of Frere a Minor. But the deuill by whoſe blowing, the flames of temptations are enkindled, enflamed this Nouice with ſo great a heat and ſting of ſenſuality, that looſing all hope of force to ouercome ſo great a temptation, he diuers times required his apparell of the ſayd Father Simon to retourne to the world, affirming that he could no longer remaine in Relligion: but the good Father comforted him, and ſtill deferred him to an other time. Neuertheles his temptations encreaſed daily. And as one day he exceedingly vrged him to permitt him to depart out of relligion, this holy Father hauing compaſsion of him, commanded him to ſitt

downe by him: which the nouice hauing done, he layd his head on his lappe, then lifting his eyes towardes heauen, he with ſuch feruour prayed for him, that being rapt in extaſie, he was heard, in ſuch ſort that the Nouice was ſo deliuered of his temptations, that thenceforward his ſenſuall heat was tourned into the fier of charity, wherof he made demonſtration after he had made his vow, by this accident: A lewd fellow was condemned for his miſdeedes, to haue his eyes cruſhed out: this Religious hauing heard report hereof, moued with charity towardes his neighbour, went and moſt inſtantly prayed the iudge, to temper iuſtice with mercy, and to mittigate the ſentence giuen againſt that criminell. The Iudge anſweared, that he could not. This good Religious then fell on his knees before the Iudge, and with tearfull eyes beſought him, that the ſentence then might be executed on himſelfe, in regard that the party condemned, would not endure the torment nor ſupport the diſgrace ſo patiently as himſelfe. The Iudge moued with ſuch wordes, and admiring the Charity of this Religious, pardoned for that time the malefactor. This holy Father being in prayer in a ſolitary place, many birdes came ouer him and by their ſinging made ſo great a noyſe, as they diſtracted him. Wherfore he commanded them in the name of God to depart, and they redily obeyed. The houre of death of this worthy ſeruant of God being att length come, and his yeares being accompliſhed, he yelded his ſoule to his Creatour, adorned with vertues and ſanctity. He was buryed in the Couent of Spoletum where his notable merittes haue bin manifeſted, he hauing obtayned many graces of God, for the comfort and benefitt of infinitie perſonnes that haue implored him as their interceſſour.

                  Of the mortification, charity, abſtinence, and affliction of body of the glorious Brother Christopher.
                  THE XLVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe venerable Brother Chriſtopher was borne in Romania: he was Preiſt before he entierly left the world to follow IESVS CHRIST: he was moued thervnto by the example &amp; predication of S. Francis, who hauing admitted him to the habitt and profeſſion of the Frere Minors, ſent him into France to the Prouince of Gaſcone, the yeare 1219. there to edifie ſoules and to plant the ſeed of Religion. This Father was of a profound humility and ſimplicity &amp; eſpecially pittifull to the afflicted. He ſuccoured aſsiſted and ſerued the

leapers with great deuotion and dilligence, waſhing their feet, dreſsing their ſoares and vlcers, making their beddes, paring their nayles, and giuing them comfort in all their neceſsities. But how much he was pittifull in the behalfe of others, as charity commanded him, ſo much was he ſeuere and rigorous to himſelfe, weakening him ſelfe by continuall faſtes, and wearing a groſſe hairecloth, hauing beſides for a long time worne a coat of maile the more to torment his fleſh. His perſeuerance in rigour of life was, ſuch that being an hundred yeares old he did eat but once a day, except the ſondayes and principall feaſtes of the yeare, ſo that albeit his body grew old and decayed, he was neuettheles alwayes yong and firme in vertues. Notwithſtanding ſuch mortifications and abſtinences he had a face very cheerfull, for the interiour ioy ſhined and appeared exteriourly, and the moſt ſweet and gracious loue of his hart towardes his God, made all the afflictions ſweet which his body endured.
               
               
                  Of the diuine conſolations which he receaued in prayer and att Maſſe.
                  THE XLIX. CHAPTER.
                  THis holy Religious neuer ſpent his time idly, but euer employed himſelfe either in prayer, or reading, or in manuall exerciſe in the garden, or in ſome other ſeruice neceſsary to relligion. He was wery dilligent in prayer, and had the grace of ſhedding many teares. And that he might the more commodiously apply himſelfe to prayer, he made choice of a very litle cell, made of earth and boughes of trees ſeparate frome the others, wherin he ſpent moſt of his time (which was a thing in manner generall to the firſt Fathers of that time) and there was he often viſited diuinely: as alſo the glorious Virgin Mary appeared vnto him one time with her mother S. Anne, &amp; comforted him that was particulerly deuout vnto them. He euery day ſaid maſſe with great deuotion and abondance of teares: which was very gratefull to IEVS CHRIST, as by the ſequell appeareth. This venerable Brother ſaying maſſe one morning, one of the candels on the altare was caſually putt out, and there was ſeene a light inſtantly to diſcend from heauen that lightened it againe. There was often ſeene a white pigeon houering ouer his head whiles he ſaid maſſe: the Religious that ſerued and aſsiſted him did often ſee it, he was a yong man very neat, and an innocent diſciple of his, called Brother Peter, who hauing forſaken his kinred, his friendes, his patrimony and all the world beſides (on whoſe fallacious and deceiptfull apparences he would not relye) entred into the Religion of Frere Minors,

where he aſcended to ſuch ſanctity, that in regard of his pure ſimplicity he merited often times to ſee and ſpeake with his good Angell Gardien. The firſt time that he ſaw the pigeon diſcend vpon the head of the glorious Br. Chriſtopher, not knowing what it ſignified, he ſought to driue it away, wherin he exceedingly troubled his maſter, who was enforced to will him to lett it alone, and therby it was knowne what it was. This venerable Father one time calling to minde his ſinnes committed in the world, extremely feared the puniſhment they deſerued, conformably to that which the ſcripture ſayth: Happy is he that alwayes feareth, and therfore he prayed this Angelicall yong man Br. Peter whoſe conſcience he knew very well, to demaund of his familier Angell, his eſtate touching his former ſinnes: who made him this anſweare: Tell Brother Chriſtopher he need not feare his ſinnes paſt, becauſe God hath pardoned them entierly. But lett him ſtriue to perſeuer in his good worckes begun, that he may meritt eternall life.
                  The reſt of this Chapter is inſerted in the end of the 71. chapter of the ſecond booke, being a viſion that this holy Father had of the death of Sainct Francis.
               
               
                  Of ſome miracles wrought by this glorious Br. Chriſtopher in his life time.
                  THE L. CHAPTER.
                  ALthough this holy mā did not publikely aſcend into the pulpitt to preach the word of God: yet did he deliuer it to ſuch people as he conuerſed withall, giuing them profitable admonitions accompanyed with ſeuere reprehenſions: ſo that according to the etymologie of his name, he carryed IESVS CHRIST in his body by penance, in his hart by ſeruent prayers, and in his mouth by diuine prayſes and wordes of his law, which he imprinted in the memory of ſinners: And God, by many miracles which he wrought by him, would demonſtrate, how gratefull his worckes were vnto him, and of what vertue and efficacie his prayers were before his diuine maieſty.
                  Being in the citty of Cahors in France, a child of eight yeares old, called Remond, afflicted with ſo greiuous a diſeaſe that he was eſteemed neere his end, S. Chriſtopher, att the inſtancie of his mother prayed for him, and hauing made the ſigne of the croſſe and layd his hand vppō the child, he preſently ſpake calling his mother, who came with great ioy and gaue him to eat, and ſo by the prayer of this holy Religious, againſt all humane hope and apparance he was cured.
                  In the ſame citty an other child called Peter could not moue his right

arme nor his foot, and beſides had almoſt loſt his ſight, ſo that he was generally iudged as dead. This holy Father att the requeſt of the mother came to viſitt him, and read the goſpell ouer him, then made the ſigne of the croſſe from his head to his feet, and the child was inſtantlie cured.
                  A man of the ſame citty, hauing bin long time afflicted with the falling ſicknes, prayed the holy Father to giue him his benediction, which hauing receaued, he was entierly cured of the ſaid infirmity.
                  A woman of Sauueterre in the ſame citty was exceedinglie vexed with a fieuer, and hauing great deuotion to the holy Father, ſhe ſent vnto him to come viſitt her: which he hauing performed and prayed for her, ſhe was cured by the ſigne of the croſſe.
                  A Prieſt that was very ſicke, drincking of the holy water giuen him by Br. Chriſtopher that viſited him, was inſtantly cured.
                  Againe in the Biſhopprick of Cahors a woman hauing left her child in the field whiles ſhe was reaping corne, by a ſodaine ſiniſter accident he became dumme. The mother hauing carryed him to diuers churches, &amp; recommended him to God by the inuocation of many ſainctes, the child found no cure. Att length full of confidence and deuotion ſhe preſented him to this holy Father, who hauing made his prayer, and the ſigne of the croſſe vpon him, he reſtored him to his mother ſpeaking as before: and ſhee giuing thanckes to God and his ſeruant, retourned full of conſolation vnto her houſe.
               
               
                  Of the ſpiritt of prophetie, and of ſome other miracles wrought by this glorious ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt.
                  
                  THE LI. CHAPTER.
                  THere was without the citty of Cahors a very high mountaine, by which this holy Father paſsing one day, he ſaw many men and women on the banck of the riuer that ran vnder the ſayd mountaine, employed in diuers actions. Br. Chriſtopher ſayd vnto thē: Fly ye all from this place, and that inſtantly: for the mountaine will incontinently fall: ſome of them, ſeeing no appearance, laughed firſt att this admonition. Yet the ſanctity of this good Father being manifeſtly knowen, they all retired from that place, which they had ſcarcely done, but a great part of the mountaine fell downe without hurting any perſon: wherfore they all gaue thanckes to God for the benefitt receaued, and were the more deuout vnto this ſainct.
                  A woman of the ſayd citty hauing bin afflicted with a longe infirmity, was viſited by the ſainct; whome ſhe prayed to obtaine of God

for her, either that he would pleaſe to reſtore her health, or by death to deliuer her from ſuch extreme anguiſhes. This holy Father anſweared her: feare not, but take courage my daughter, for on ſuch a day att the third houre thou ſhalt depart out of this life. On the ſayd day he expresly retourned att the ſame houre: whome ſhe ſeeing, ſayd vnto him: Father that which you told me ſeemeth not to be accompliſhed, he replyed: doubt not my daughter, for it ſhall incontinently be accompliſhed, as in deed it was. For as they did ring att the third houre, this woman being cōfeſſed and hauing performed what belonged to a Chriſtian, in the preſence of this holy Father and of many others, yelded her ſpiritt to our Sauiour.
                  This ſeruant of God in Marſeilles ſaw two men in guiſe of Phiſitians comming to viſitt one that was ſicke: but knowing in ſpiritt that this ſick perſon was in eſtate of mortall ſinne, and that the ſeeming Phiſitians were two deuils, he made the ſigne of the croſſe againſt them, and they inſtantly vaniſhed: then the holy Father admoniſhing the ſick party, he ſincerely confeſſed his ſinnes, and being contrite and comforted with a quiett conſcience, he happely departed from this life to a better.
                  In the ſayd citty a good deuout woman, had a very auaricious husbād and ſparing in worckes of mercy: whervpon ſhe complayned to this holy Father that ſhe had nothing to giue in almoſe but wine. The S. bid her giue ſecurely of that wine for the loue of God. This woman obeyed him, giuing therof to all poore that had need, in ſuch ſort that there was not much left in the veſſell, her husband drincking, knew by the taſt of this wine that it was very low and neere the lyes; wherfore he grew into choler with his wife, examining her what was become of his wine: ſhe full of trembling anſweared that there was yet much in the veſſell. The husband ſent his ſeruant to be truely enformed what quantity was left: ſhe found the veſſell full euen to the bung: wherof ſhe with great ioy incontinently aduertiſed her maſter, which reuiued the ſoule of his wife, that was dying with feare, and thervpon ſhe boldly recounted all to her husband, who reſolued thenceforward to be more charitable towardes the poore; attributing the preſent miracle to the merittes of the glorious Br. Chriſtopher and to the vertue of charity, whoſe worckes our Lord doth not only recompence in the other world, but euen in this alſo.
               
               
                  Of the glorious death of Br. Chriſtopher.
                  THE LII. CHAPTER.
                  AFter that almighty God had ennobled and enriched his ſeruant Chriſtopher with many merittes and miracles, and by the example

of his holy life, had ſingulerly planted the rule and Order of the Frere Minors in diuers places of France, where he cauſed the erecting of many Couents which he furniſhed with Religious of holy life and exemplare conuerſation: he would att length recompence him with eternall reward, as he ordinarily doth thoſe that faithfully labour in the vigneyard of his holy Church. The night when he paſſed from this miſerable life to that which is bleſſed, all the Religious being aſſembled about his bed, he made them a long diſcourſe of the kingdome of God, exhorting them to perſeuer with purity in his holy ſeruice; they then demaunded his benediction, which he gaue them very affectionatly, in the name of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, then recommending his ſpiritt to his Creator, he rendred it vnto him; and his body remayned ſo 
                        •
                     elligiously compoſed, that he ſeemed to sleep. He dyed in the citty of Cahors, the yeare of grace 1272. (hauing ſpent fifteen yeares in the Order of the Frere Minors) att ſix of the clock att night the Eue of Alſaintes, to reigne eternally with them. Att the very houre of his death, two Religious women ancient both in Relligion and vertues, did teſtifie to haue heard Angelicall muſike exceedingly mellodious, accompanying the ſoule of this worthy ſeruant of God, vnto heauen. A man of the third Order, &amp; of that citty, in a viſion ſaw the ſoule of this glorious Father att the hower of his departure, carryed by Angels with great ioy into Paradiſe. The ſame night a Burgeſſe of Cahors called Peter, ſaw in viſion the ſoule of this holy Father ſitting on a very reſplendant couch that did ſpread and ſparckle glittering beames as the ſunne: of whome demaunding who he was, I am ſaid he, the ſoule of Br. Chriſtopher, that haue left my body on earth and am goeing to heauen. This man ſodenly awaked, and ariſing, likewiſe awakened all his familie to whome he recounted his viſion; then went to the monaſtery where he found the body of the holy Father alredy according to the cuſtome, carryed into the Church, thence to be enterred elſe where. The day following, the death of this holy Father being diuulged, there repayred ſuch a cōcourſe of people to ſee this bleſſed body, that he could not be taken out of the handes of thoſe that deſired to touch him, to kiſſe &amp; teare off part of his habitt to keepe for reliques, and to demaund ſome grace of God by the merittes of him that had worne it. This body being with much a doe att length takē out of the Church, &amp; embalmed with precious liquours and aromaticall oyntments, it was on the third day putt in a coffin of wood, and enterred in the Church of the Frere Minors, with great ſolemnity and reuerence.
               
               
                  
                  Of the dead rayſed, by the inuocation of this ſainct.
                  THE LIII. CHAPTER.
                  ALmighty God voutſafed alſo to demōſtrate the exceeding great miracles which by the merittes of this his gratefull ſeruant he wrought in the biſhopprick of Cahors: for a mother hauing caſually left her child vpon a bridge, he fell into the water and was drowned. The mother ſeeing her child dead, filled all the village with compaſsion of the ſorrow and griefe which by her extreme lamentation ſhe did diſcouer. Att length ſhe had recourſe to S. Chriſtopher, to whome ſhe vowed to viſitt his ſepulcher and to preſent vnto it an image of waxe if he would raiſe her ſonne. The vow being made, the child began to moue his lippes, then to open his eyes, and by the merittes of ſuch an interceſſour in preſence of many people, he retourned to life and 
                        •
                     afety.
                  A creature being wreſted dead out of the mothers wombe, was reſtored to life by the prayers and interceſsions of this ſainct, who was exceedingly importuned and induced thervnto by thoſe that were preſent.
                  In the ſame citty, a mother had layd her child of two yeares old in bed betweene her husband and her ſelfe: but awaking ſhe found the child ſmothered and dead: after many regreets ſhe made vow to S. Chriſtopher, that if by his interceſsion the child might reuiue, ſhe would carrie it to his ſepulcher, and there would preſent a light and image of waxe. Which vow being made the child began to gape, then to moue the armes, and att length opening his eyes it retourned to life.
                  In the ſame citty and after the ſame manner, the S. being inuocated, for a dead child by the father who was deuout vnto him, in theſe tearmes: O ſaint of God rayſe my daughter and I promiſe thee to carry her to thy ſepulcher, where I will offer there an altare cloth and an image of waxe; ſhe vpon this vow retourned to life, and the Father and others preſent gaue thanckes to almighty God and to the S. In a towne called Concet neere to the ſaid citty, there was a youg man ſo weakened with a continuall feauer, that he was generally eſteemed for dead, no motion could be perceaued in him not ſo much as of his pulſe: wherfore his mother in extreme affliction, perceauing all humane helpe to faile, had recourſe to almighty God, whome ſhe inuocated by the merittes of S. Chriſtopher, of whome ſhe had heard many miracles recounted, to reſtore her ſonnes health; vowing, to carry him to his ſepulcher, &amp; there to preſent an altare cloth and an image of wax. The effect was admirable,

for the preſenting of her vow being finiſhed he began to amend, and in ſhort time was entierly cured, to the great aſtoniſhment and content of all his friendes and kinred, who fayled not to giue thanckes to God and to accompliſh their vow.
                  Health was alſo reſtored to an other yong man called Iohn, deſperatly ſick att Cahors in the manner aforeſayd.
                  A Relligious of the Order of S. Clare called Siſter Mary, being ſo extremely weakened with ſicknes that ſhe could not remoue her ſelfe in her bed, nor much leſſe take her reſt therin, ſhe expected only death: but hauing heard it reported that the holy Father Chriſtopher was deceaſſed, and that he wrought infinite miracles, ſhe bitterly lamenting preſented vnto him this requeſt. O holy Father that haſt often heard my confeſsion, pray vnto almighty God if thou pleaſe, that I may recouer my health, to ſerue him. Which ſpoaken ſhe fell into a ſweet sleep, from whence the next morning ſhe awakened full of comfort and conſolation, and went to the quier to communicate with her other ſiſters, who theratt were much amazed: and afterwardes they all together gaue thanckes to the omnipotent bounty of God and to his holy interceſſour, by whoſe merittes he ſo compaſsionatly aſsiſteth thoſe that addreſſe their petitions vnto him.
               
               
                  Of other miracles wrought in the cure of many dangerous and incurable diſeaſes.
                  THE LIV. CHAPTER.
                  VPon the Mount Abban in the biſhopprick of Cahors, a child reduced neere vnto death, and his mother extremely afflicted by diſpaire of her ſonnes recouery; which hauing exceedingly weakened her by the great wearines of labour that this ſickneſſe cauſer her, ſhe fell into a litle sleep, wherin ſhe heard a voice that ſayd vnto her: Woman feare no more, but make a vow for thy ſonne to S. Chriſtopher, and God by his merittes will cure him. This woman awaking, and hauing made her vow, her ſonne was cured, and the mother carryed him to the ſepulcher of the ſainct, wher ſhe thancked God and her Interceſſour for it.
                  A woman of the ſaid citty of Cahors called Valeria, was ſo ſick that the Phiſitians iudged her as dead, and withall had alredy loſt her ſpeech and the motion of all her members, and was as black as pitch, a prieſt alſo comming to heare her confeſsion, was conſtrayned to retourne without vſing his function: for ſhe could neither ſpeake, heare, nor make any ſignes. But her kinred and freindes that were preſent, greiued att

the loſſe of a woman whome they cordially loued, fell deuoutly on their knees, lifted vp their ioyned handes, their contenances, and their prayers towardes heauen, and recommended her to the merittes of the holy Br. Chriſtopher: and preſently the ſick woman began to ſpeake and to praiſe God in his ſeruant, who had deliuered her from the perill of death, and reſtored her perfect health.
                  A Prieſt called Geffry, being by the Phiſitians forſaken as dead, and hauing already for the ſpace of two dayes loſt his ſpeech, a ſiſter of his praying to the S. for him, he began to ſpeake, and afterward was perfectly cured.
                  A woman ſo lamed in her handes and feet that ſhe could hardly goe with cruches, fell on her knees neere the ſepulcher of the S. and the e prayed him to obtaine her cure, vowing vnto him a foot and hand of wax. Her prayer and vow being ended, ſhe was entierly cured, and went ioyfully with other women to carry lime and brick, to finiſh the ſepulcher of the ſainct.
                  A yong man called Arnold was borne with his feet ſo crooked and wreſted that they could not ſupport him: his parentes vowed for him to the holy ſeruant of God, affirming that they would really acknowledge him for a ſainct if he would cure the lame party, who to the exceeding amazement of thoſe preſent, ſtood vpright, ſound and ioyfull, and his father himſelfe conducted him to viſitt his ſepulcher, publikely denouncing the grace and fauour which our Lord had done him, by the merittes of this glorious Interceſſour. There are found recorded many other miracles which God wrought by the merites of his holy ſeruant Br. Chriſtopher, deliuering many from death that were deſperatly ſick, reſtoring ſight to the blind, curing feiuers, goutes, fiſtulaes, and other infirmities, reſtoring ſpeech to the dumme, hearing to the deafe, and finally relieuing all that by his merittes inuocated almigthy God. But to auoyd prolixity I forbeare heare to deduce them, eſteeming the prealeadged ſufficient to occaſion the faithfull to belieue the ſanctitye of this ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST. The miracle following ſhalbe for the incredulous only: A man called Ratier, being by chaunce neere vnto the ſepulcher of this S. and hearing his miracles related: I cannot belieue, ſaid he, that a man whome I haue ſeene in theſe dayes can worck miracles. Thoſe preſent hauing reprehēded him, he would not acknowledge his errour, wherfore he deſerued to be chaſticed of God, as he was, thereby to make him know his temerity. For departing thence he had ſcarcely recouered his home but he felt himſelfe ſurpriſed with a vehement fieuer, the affliction wherof opening his vnd
                        ••
                     ſtanding, he alſo called to minde the arrogancie and temerity of his wordes, which he exceedingly repented, ſaying: O S. Chriſtopher, pardon me, and aſsiſt

me I beſeech thee, I confeſſe thou wert and art a S. and in the vertue of God canſt worck miracles, to whome thou haſt bin ſo faithfull and obedient a ſeruant: I promiſe thee, if thou pleaſe to reſtore vnto me my health, I will preſently viſitt thy ſepulcher, there to giue thee thanckes. This vow being made, he was inſtantly cured, and aroſe ſound from his bedd, and went to accompliſh his vow, giuing thanckes to God and to his holy ſeruant: and thenceforward he became a faithfull Profeſſour &amp; proclamer of the ſanctity of the bleſſed Father Chriſtopher.
               
               
                  A ſummarie of the life of ſome other diſciples of the holy Father S. Francis.
                  THE LV. CHAPTER.
                  IT would be a matter ouer tedious both to read, and to write the liues of all the diſciples and companions of S. Francis, wherwith, as ſo many precious ſtones adorned with many graces and vertues, the ſaid holy Father began to build his Euangelicall religion: conſidering withall that we haue not ſuch authenticall relation of their liues &amp; miracles as is requiſite and neceſſary. In reſpect wherof we doe not make a particuler relation of each of them; but will recount ſomewhat of certaine of them who haue ſo ſpent their time, that albeit their fame be not equall to the aforenamed, yet are they not of leſſe ſanctity and glory before God. The firſt of whome is the glorious Br. Peter Catanius the ſecond diſciple of S. Francis, and his firſt Vicar Generall, who was an eye witneſſe of many Myſteryes that almighty God communicated vnto him, as in his life we haue recorded. This holy Religious being dead, God had already began by his interceſsion to worck many miracles, when the holy Father S. Francis hauing commanded him to forbeare the obtayning of ſuch miraculous graces from God, his miracles ceaſſed, as hath bin amply diſcourſed in the hundredth chapter of the firſt booke, where is likewiſe related wherfore he was made Vicar Generall.
                  Brother Angelus of Rieta was the firſt knight that entred this religiō, and was one of the twelue firſt diſciples of S. Francis, and his companion in many worthy myſteries and miracles. The holy Father put from this good Religious an extreme feare which he had of the deuils, in ſuch ſort that he durſt not continue alone att his prayers by night: for he commanded him to goe about midnight to the toppe of a high mountaine, and there aloud to crye out theſe wordes: yee proud deuils, come ye all now to me, and doe the worſt you can: which hauing by due obedience performed, none of the deuils euer after came to annoy him, ſo that he was entierly freed of the ſayd feare. And being fully perfected

in vertues and prayer, he paſſed from this life to God, and was buryed att Aſsiſium, with other companyons of S. Francis.
                  Br. William an Engliſhman, was admitted in the number of the firſt twelue Diſciples of S. Francis, in the place of Br. Iohn Chappell, that was an Apoſtata, and did hang himſelfe as Iudas had done. The miracles wrought by this bleſſed Br. William in his ſepulcher, haue ſufficiently teſtified what he was: for almighty God by his merites there wrought ſo many, that he ſeemed to obſcure the glory of his Father S. Francis, by whome he was buryed: and therfore Br. Helie who then was Generall of the Order, went to his tombe, and commanded him by holy obedience to forbeare worcking any more miracles.
                  Br. Moricke, who was firſt Religious of the Order of the Porte-Croix or Croſſe-bearers, was eminent vnder the diſcipline of the holy Father S. Francis, and was moſt famous for his admirable abſtinence, and for a long ſpace woare on his fleſh an iron ſhirt, did eate no bread, but only hearbes and rawe pulſe; he neuer woare coat, but the only habitt during his life, and att his death he left many ſignes of his ſanctity and perfect life.
                  Br. Benett of Arezzo was alſo perfect in all vertues. S. Francis ſent him to be Prouinciall att Antioch. There are ſtrange matters recounted of this Religious, which being difficult to be belieued, and not being ſatisfied by the teſtimony of the writer, I haue thought it beſt not to record them here, for feare that they appearing indeed doubtfully, the like iudgement ſhould be giuen of others here recorded that are moſt certaine and indubitable.
                  It ſhall therfore ſuffice, to know, that this bleſſed Father had the ſpiritt of propheſie, as they teſtifie who knew him: and that hauing perſeuered in ſanctity of life, he repoſed in peace. He was buryed in Arezzo his owne country, whither, it is held that he brought from Babilon, one of the fingers of the holy Prophett Daniel.
                  Br. Peregrinus of Faleron was admitted to the religion of the holy Father S. Francis, who propheſied vnto him, that albeit he weere learned, he ſhould notwithſtanding apply himſelfe to the actiue life, and his companion to the contemplatiue, and ſo it arriued, for he was a lay brother: for which humility, he obtayned of God an exceeding great perfection in vertues, and particulerly the grace of compunction and the loue of God; for whoſe ſake deſiring martyrdome, he went to Ieruſalem, where he viſited all the holy places, with ſuch deuotion, teares, embracinges and moſt tender louing kiſſes, that in thoſe places he adored our Sauiour as preſent. Br. Bernard Quintaualle affirmed of this Religious, that he was one of the moſt perfect of the world. And as he was by name a Stranger, ſo was he alſo in his life: for the loue of IESVS

CHRIST was ſo burning in his hart, that he neuer permitted any other thing to reſt there: but alwayes walked and ſighed towardes heauen: thus did he aſcend from vertue to vertue, in ſuch ſort that he was exceedingly illuminated in his life, and in his death, by diuers miracles.
                  Br. Ricerio employed himſelfe in the contemplatiue life, according to the propheſie of S. Francis; which made him familier vnto him, and he inſtructed him in many diuine verities, he made him Prouinciall of the marquiſate of Ancona; many matters cōcerning this holy Religious are recorded in the life of S. Francis.
                  Br. Auguſtin of Aſsiſium, Prouinciall of the land of Labour, commō
                     ly called Naples, was a Religious of ſuch ſanctity, that he merited, not only to be companion in life and profeſsion with S. Francis, but alſo in his death and glory: for hauing in his laſt ſicknes already loſt his ſpeech, he ſaw the ſoule of S.

                  Br. Roger the diſciple of S. Francis, v as of ſuch ſanctity, that Pope Gregorie the ninth approued him for a S. &amp; permitted commemoration to be made of him in the Couēt of the Frere Minors of Tiuoly; but becauſe he was not canonized with the accuſtomed ſolēnities, the Religious neuer durſt keep his ſolēne feaſt. He was not canonized becauſe the examē of his miracles, appointed by the ſaid Pope, was neuer accompliſhed.
                  Brother Philippe the Long, was alſo diſciple of S. Francis. He was the firſt Confeſſour, Viſitour and Miniſter of the Religious of S. Clare. It is found recorded of this S. that an Angell purged his lippes, touching them with a burning coale, as the Seraphin did to the Prophett

                  Br. Barbarus, Br. Iohn of S. Conſtantin, and Br. Bernard of Viridante, that were of the firſt companions of S. Francis, were exceeding eminent in their vertuous and merueillous actions; as their worckes were written in the booke of life, ſo their ſoules for euer liue in glory, &amp; their bodyes are buryed in the Couent of S. Francis att Aſsiſium.
                  Br. Pacificus, companion of the holy Father, was of ſuch perfection that he merited to ſee many merueillous worckes, which our Lord ſecretly wrought in his ſeruant S. Frācis, and becauſe the glorious S. knew his perfection and ſanctity, he ſent him Prouinciall into Frāce, where he remayned diuers yeares, then dyed and was buryed att Laon.

Francis: whoſe life being of ſinguler note, it is requiſite it ſhould be deſcribed more att lardge. The time employed in reading therof ſhall not be waſted: for the ſoules therby ſhalbe enriched with holy doctrines, with diuine examples and documents.

                  THE II. CHAPTER.
                  IT was the cuſtome of the firſt Fathers of this Order, to goe often in pilgrimage, not to ſeeke their more liberty, nor to ſatisfie their appetite with better cheere, but for the exerciſe of perfection, and to ſuffer hungar, thirſt, cold, heate, and the affi ontes which they often endured, as vnknowne in that new habitt, and ſo did they diſpoſe thē
                     ſelues to the incommodities of obedience, and were couragious: for they went barefoot, withone ſingle habit, without wallets, edifying themſelues in patience, and their neighbour in charitie. Now Brother Giles hauing gotten leaue of the holy Father S. Francis he went to viſitt the church of S. Iames of Compoſtella, in which voyage he did not ſo much as once ſatisfie his hungar, ſuch a deſire had he to feele in himſelfe the force of pouerty for the loue of IESVS CHRIST. Finding one day no meane to gett ſo much as bread (wherwith only he liued) hauing found in a barne certaine huskes of beanes left there after the threſhing, he did eat them with great appetite, and after tooke his reſt in the ſame place. The next morning he aroſe very early, as cheerfull and well diſpoſed as if he had eaten the beſt and moſt delicate foode in the world. He was thus accuſtomed to ſuffer, being often in forreſtes and ſolitary places, which were more to his content then the conuerſation of the world, as leſſe ſubiect to diſtractions in his ſpirituall exerciſes, and more commodious for ſpending the night in watching and prayer. In this iorney meeting with a poore ſick creature full of ſoares, and not knowing what to giue him, he ript of his capuce and gaue it vnto him: but this charity enforced him to trauell twenty dayes bare-headed, till att laſt was giuen him cloth to make an other, and ſo did he walke with a habitt, according to the common faſhion of his Order, deformed, but entierly conformable to the charity of the goſpell. Being in Lombardie, he was called by a man, of whome he thought to receaue a charitie, but comming to him, he tooke out a paire of dice, and demaunded if he would play with him: So did the wretch flout att this good Religious, who went on bowing downe his head without replying a word. In this ſort he was often the obiect of laughter vnto the ſloathfull and idle companions, that made him their ſcorne, which he alwayes endured with patience correſpondent. After he had alſo viſited all the holy land, expecting commodity of ſhipping to retourne

into Italy, it being neceſſary for him to liue vpon his labour as hauing no mony, he carryed water to paſſengers, for which ſeruice they gaue him bread, and remayning certaine dayes in the citty of Aſon, he employed himſelfe in the labour of his handes making baskettes and caſes of ozier, and ſuch litle conceates, wherwith he liued; and if he wanted either worck or matter, or knew not wherin to employ himſelfe, according to the diuers occaſions of the places where he reſt
                        ••
                     ed, his laſt refuge was to haue recourſe to the abondant table of God, demaunding almoſe att the peoples dores, according to the documentes of his rule. He went alſo to viſit the mount ſaint Michael, then ſaint Nicholas of Bar; and in all theſe voyages into whatſoeuer place he entred, he exhorted thoſe that he found, to doe pennance for their ſinnes, and to apply themſelues to the ſeruice of God the bountifull giuer of all goodnes, and to doe this in loue and charity towardes their neighbour. As he one day trauailled, he became ſo weary and ſo oppreſſed with hungar, that he was enforced to reſt himſelfe, and with wearines he fell a ſleepe. As he awaked he found by him halfe a loafe which God had ſent him of almoſe, which he ioyfully did eat, thancking his diuine maieſty: and being by meane of this celeſtiall bread reconforted, he cheerfully proceeded on his iorney.
               
               
                  How this ſeruant of God endeauoured to gaine his liuing by the worck and labour of his handes.
                  THE III. CHAPTER.
                  S. Francis hauing ſent him to remayne att Rome, therby the better to ſatisfie his deſire, which was to liue vpon his labour, he went to a mountaine three leagues diſtant whence he brought wood to the citty: and for the price therof he was coutent with the gift of bread for his one dayes 
                        •
                     uſtenance. He brought wood to a woman, who knowing him to be Religious would giue him a greater hire then was conditioned, but Brother Giles for the ſame cauſe (to witt for the loue of God) would not accept it, affirming that he would not be vanquiſhed by auarice, wherwith this woman was exceedingly edifyed. He diſdayned not to vndertake any ſeruice that might be required of him, prouided that it exceeded not the limites of modeſty; and ſo miſpriſing the vanities of the world, he perfected and refined himſelfe in mortification and humility. Aſsiſting ſome others one time to gather nuttes, and his dayes labour being ended he was payed in nuttes, which being vnable to hold in his sleeues,

he putt off his habitt, and tyed the two endes of his sleeues which he filled euen to the capuce, and ſo carryed them to Rome, where he diuided them among the poore: to conclude hauing imparted ſome ſhare of his gaine to the Religious, he alſo gaue part vnto the poore.
                  Sometime he tooke of the water of S. Sixtus and carryed to the Religious of Quatuor Coronatorum, who gladly dranck therof, and for the ſame gaue him bread, wherwith he liued, and what remayned he diſtributed vnto the poore. As he one day carryed water to the ſayd Religious, a poore man in the way demaunded of him to drinck, and he gaue him therof: but vnwilling that the Religious ſhould haue the reſt, he retourned to draw more att the fountaine which was a league diſtant, ſuch was his deſire with his poſsibility to giue each one contentment. When any one hired him and entertayned him to day-labour, he alwayes conditionally reſerued time requiſite with attention to ſay his canonicall howers, and certaine other ſuffrages and deuotions. He was very carefull to ſhunne idlenes, and therfore he alwayes either ſpake of God, or prayed and contemplated, or vſed ſome handy labour in ſome litle matter of vtility; whence proceeded, that looſing no part of his time, he ſufficiently prouided both for his ſoule and and body.
                  The Pope being att Rieta, the Cardinall Nicolas Biſhop of Toſcolan, deſiring to haue Brother Giles in his company, out of great reſpect he had to his ſimplicity and ſanctity, he inſtantly prayed him to ſeiorne certaines dayes with him, and to be content to eat as he did att his table, forbearing to ſeek almoſe otherwhere: But Brother Giles willingly promiſing to remayne in his houſe, would not yeld to eat of that he found there, and ſo went thither. Now the Cardinall complayning vnto him for that he would not eat of his bread, Brother Giles anſwearedPſal▪ 127. with this verſe of Dauid: Labores manuum tuarum quia manducabis beatus es &amp; benetibi er
                           •
                        t. The Cardidall not knowing what to reply, prayed him att leaſt to eat that which he receaued of his almoſe, or of his labour with his companion, which he promiſed to doe: and thenceforward he brought his begged bread to the Cardinals table, where he did eat it, and if any remayned he gaue it to to the poore. But there falling one day ſuch a raine that Brother Giles could not goe abroad either to labour or to ſeeke almoſe, the Cardinall was very ioyfull therof, hoping that day to haue his deſire, and that Brother Giles would eat of his bread: but he was deceaued, for Brother Giles exceedingly troubled for that he could not gaine his bread, bethought himſelfe and went into the kitchin, where asking the Cooke wherfore his kitchin lay ſo vncleanly, offered to ſweepe it for the gift of two loaues: which hauing gotten, he went to eat the ſaid bread with the Cardinall; who was

againe deceaued the morning following, when as it rained extremely, for Brother Giles vnable to goe abroad, found meane for bread to make cleane the diſhes, which made the Cardinall admire his firme reſolution to li

                  How our Lord releiued Brother Giles in an extreme neceſsitie.
                  THE IV. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Giles hauing thus ſeiourned a certaine time in the Cardinals houſe, the time of Lent drawing very neere, he determined to retire with his companion, into ſome ſolitary place, where his ſpiritt might contemplate in entiere repoſe: and to this effect tooke leaue of this Cardinal, who therwith exceedingly afflicted ſayd vnto him: Alas my deere freind whither goeſt thou, as a bird without a neſt? But this good Religious aſcended vp to a mountaine, where he found a litle chappell (hauing bin an hermitage) called S. Laurence, farre diſtant from habitation, and conſequently very ſolitary: there he reſolued to ſpend his lent, but three dayes after he was there arriued, it did ſo ſnow and freeze, that they could not poſsibly goe abroad. The holy Religious ſeeing there was no meane to goe foorth to ſeeke bread, ſayd to his companion: Brother lett vs make petition to almighty God that he will pleaſe in our neceſsity to ſend vs bread, ſith there is none but he that can heare and releiue vs. Then he recounted an hiſtory of certaine Religious, who wanting bread in the like neceſsity, had recourſe to him and were heard. Being moued by ſuch an example, they began on the euenning to pray with loud voice vnto almighty God, &amp; ſo perſeuered till the breake of the day following, when as God inſpired a good man of a neighbouring place, who ſeeing the ſnow ſo extreme, called to minde that he had ſeene att other times Hermites att S. Laurence, &amp; thought with himſelfe, that if then there were any there, they could not come foorth to ſeeke food; which mouing him to compaſsion he went out of his houſe with bread and wine, which he gaue to the Religious, and being retourned to his houſe, he aduertiſed his neighbours and friendes of the neceſsity of the ſaid ſeruantes of God, and ſo procured that they wanted not wherwith to liue the reſt of the lent, which happened to good purpoſe for them in regard of their extreme neceſsity. Br. Giles deſirous to acknowledge the great charity vſed vnto him by thoſe people, he ſaid to his companion: hitherto we haue prayed to God for our ſelues, to be relieued in our neceſsity: heceforward we ought to pray vnto him for our benefactors; ſo that perſiſting night and day in theſe petitions, our Lord beſtowed ſuch graces

and fauours on the inhabitantes of that place, that neuer Frere Minor hauing bin formely ſeene there, many among them neuertheles being moued by the example and pious exhortations of the ſayd Religious, forlooke the vanity of this world and became Frere Minors; and ſuch as could not, ſerued God by prayers, and did penance in their owne houſes: and by this meane for corporall benefittes they gaue in exchaunge ſpirituall in double meſure.
               
               
                  Of the humilitie and obedience of Br. Giles.
                  THE V. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father S. Francis cordially loued Br. Giles for his great perfection in all vertues, and his promptitude in doeing well: and therfore did often obſerue him, and would ſay to his other Religious, that he was one of his knightes of the round table, ſo did he call the humble and deuout Religious. Now Br. Giles one day demaunded obedience of S. Francis to goe where he pleaſed, or to remayne where he was: the holy Father anſweared him, your reſidence is prouided, goe where you will: whervpon hauing demaunded and receiued his benediction, he went and walked in this freedome fower whole dayes, but finding his ſpiritt much diſquieted, he retourned to S. Francis: Father (ſayd he) I beſeech you deſigne me a certaine place whither to goe, becauſe goeing according to my owne liberty I cannot haue my conſcience free: the S. ſent him to the Couent of Fabrian whither he went barefoote with a very ragged habitt, though the ſeaſon were extreme cold. On the way he mett a paſſenger that ſayd vnto him: I would not goe ſo poorly cloathed in ſo cold a ſeaſon, were I therby to pourchace paradice: by which wordes the deuill ſo augmented the cold that he expected death therby: but he incontinētlie called to minde that our lord IESVS CHRIST went barefoote and poorely cloathed through the world, and endured far more cold and other labours for our ſakes: theſe pious cogitations did in this ſort warme firſt his hart, and then all his body with a diuine heat: wherfore he began to praiſe God his ſweet lord, who had thus warmed him not with materiall fier, but by the only burning heatof his diuine loue. So Br. Giles remayned many yeares in the ſayd place, where one day weighing his ſinnes, he aſcended on a mountaine neere by, whither he carryed a yōg Religious, whome he commanded, with a cord about his necke to lead him naked to the place where the other Religious were: and entring in this ſort before them, he began with teares to cry: Haue compaſsion and pitty of me miſerable and deteſtable ſinner: The Religious beholding him in

ſuch a gaſtly plight, began all to weep, and prayed him to putt on his habitt: but he anſweared, with bitter teares and extreme ſighes, that he was vnworthy to be a Frere Minor: Yet if you will that I take the habitt againe, ſaid he, I will, as an almoſe receaued of you, though I doe not deſerue it: and ſo he cloathed himſelfe and there remayned, labouring with his handes in making caskettes of ſtraw to couer or keep glaſſes, and litle baskettes which he and his companion carryed to the neighbour towne and villages, and in exchau
                        •
                     ge receaued what they needed either of food or cloathing; and with the reſt he cloathed other Religious, ſaying that ſuch almoſe done to any Religious prayed for him when he ſlept and could not then pray himſelfe.
                  This good Religious retourning one day from the fieldes, hauing in his handes a reed and a hatchett, he paſt before a church, the Chappelaine wherof ſeeing him called him hippocrite: which did ſo grieue andAdmirable ſimplicity of Br. Giles. afflict Br. Giles that he wept bitterly. A Religious finding him thus lamenting, demandindg the occaſion of his teares, he anſweared him: becauſe I am an hippocrite, as a Preiſt, did now inſtantly aſſure me. The Religious replied, poore man doeſt thou then belieue it to be true? Br. Giles anſweared that he belieued it becauſe he was a Prieſt that auouched the ſame, and he could not conceaue that a Prieſt would lie. The Religious replyed, Brother, be no longer diſquieted, for it may be thou art no hippocrite, becauſe the opinion of men is moſt often farre from the iudgement of God. Br. Giles with this reaſonnable anſweare was ſomewhat ſatisfied and comforted, ſaying that if he were not ſuch, it was by the pure grace of God.
                  Hearing one day relation of the fall of Br. Helie, that had bin Generall of the Order, whence he was an Apoſtata, then liuing excommunicated thence in the traine and ſeruice of the Emperour Frederic the ſecond, then a rebell vnto the Church, he with extreme griefe fell flatt vpon the ground, and there contemptibly tourned and tumbled himſelfe, affirming that he would diſcend as low as he could, becauſe the other had wrought his owne diſtruction by clymeing ſo high.
                  This great ſeruant of God being one day out of the Couent, he receaued a letter and therby commaundement from his Generall to meet him att Aſsiſium whither he inſtantly tooke his iorney: his companion putting into his minde that it were good to retourne firſt to the Couent to aduertiſe the Religious therof, he anſweared: Brother, I am commanded to goe to Aſsiſium and not to the Couent, ſo much did he yeld himſelfe to obedience, that his only cogitation was readily to obay.
                  The Guardian hauing commanded a Religious that was praying to goe to demaund almoſe: the Religious therat murmured exceedingly withhimſelfe, and in this diſtemper came to Br. Giles thus cōplayning:

                     Reſolutiō of Bro. Giles touching prayer. Father, I was praying in my cell, and the Guardian hath commanded me to goe begge, ſo that I muſt omitt the greater good for the leſſe. B. Giles anſweared him: brother, you know not yet what prayer is: for the moſt true and perfect is, that the ſubiect doe the wil of his Superiour.
               
               
                  How zealous Br. Giles was of his rule, and of holy pouerty.
                  THE VI. CHAPTER.
                  THe bleſſed Br. Giles, as the true diſciple of S. Francis was a great friend of pouerty. From his entring into Religion to the end of his life he had neuer but one habitt, and that all patched. He went alwayes barefoot, &amp; made his owne cell with earth and brāches of trees, ſhunning all ſuch ſuperfluous celles as were more hanſome &amp; commodiouſly built. Comming one time to Aſsiſium to viſitt the ſepulcher of S. Francis, the Religious ſhewed him the Couent that was new built very great and ſumptuous, ſhewing him the great edifice of the Church, and a faire ſtructure of the altare that had three ſtages or ſtories of hight, then the Cloiſter, the refectory, the dormitory and other places newly built for the commodity of the Religious, who gloried in the accōpliſhmentGraue &amp; short reprehenſions of Br. Giles against the trāſgreſsion of pouerty. of ſo eminent a peece of worck. Br. Giles very attentiuely conſidered all without vttering a word; and hauing ſeene all, he addreſſed himſelfe to thoſe that guided him ſaying: Brethren, here is no want vnto you but of women. The Religious ſeeming to be much ſcandalized att thoſe wordes, Br. Giles replyed: you ſhould not wonder att what I haue ſayd, for you know well that it is no more lawfull for vs to diſpenſe with pouerty then with chaſtity. So that you hauing bid adieu to pouerty, taking that for lawful which is directly againſt our rule, I doe much admire you doe not diſpenſe with your ſelues in the breach of this other article, conſidering that both are vowes by you equally made vnto God.
                  There was a Religious that came one day full of ioy and contentmētBad Religious more punished in hell then worldlinges. to Br. Giles &amp; ſayd: Father I bring you good newes. This laſt night, I ſaw a viſion of hell; and looking very curiouſly into it, I could not ſee any of our Relligious. Which Br. Giles vnderſtanding, he ſighing ſayd: I belieue thee my child, I belieue that you haue ſeene none: and oftentimes reiterating the ſame wordes he was rauiſhed in ſpiritt: then retourning to himſelfe he added: belieue it for certaine, my Child, that there are ſome▪ but thou ſaweſt them not becauſe thou diddeſt not diſcend low enough, where they are tormēted, wretched as they are for not hauing performed worckes conformable to their rule and habit: for as holy Religious haue, with the moſt perfect and glorious, their reſidence in heauen, ſo thoſe which are bad haue their place with the moſt wicked in hell.
               
               
                  
                  How much Br. Giles affected the purity of Chaſtity.
                  THE VII. CHAPTER.
                  THis venerable Father continually afflicted his fleſh, keeping it ſubiect to the ſpiritt: Which he did to conſerue in his ſoule the ſplendour of chaſtity, &amp; therfore he accuſtomed to eat but once a day, and that litle and very late. He would ſay that our fleſh was like vnto a hogge that very greedily ran to the dirt and filth delighting himſelfe therin, or like the beetle that in all his life doth nothing but tumble and wallow himſelfe in loathſome filthines. He would alſo affirme our fleſh to be the moſt valliant ſoldier that our ennemy hath againſt vs: by which wordes and other like, he demonſtrated what an ennemy himſelfe was to the peruerſe inclinations of his ſenſes, and what a friend to Angelicall chaſtity.
                  Being one day in the citty of Spoletum, he heard a voice as of a woman that called him: this voice being of the deuill, ſuggeſted into his heart ſuch a temptation, as he had neuer experienced a greater. But as a valerous Champion of IESVS CHRIST, he chaſed farre away his ennemy and remayned victorious, firſt by cruell diſciplining himſelfe, then by ſeruent prayer.
                  A Religious Prieſt being exceedingly afflicted and tormented by the deuill with a cruell temptation of the fleſh and getting no remedy by abſtinences and prayers, he ſayd with himſelfe, if I could ſee Br. Giles to diſcouer vnto him this mine affliction, I am aſſured he would relieue met but he was ſo farre diſtant that there was no meane to come att him. Br. Giles (or his Angell for him) appeared one night vnto him, with whoſe preſence the Religious being exceedingly comforted, he opened vnto him all his temptation, and demaunded of him ſome ayde and counſaile. Br. Giles ſayd vnto him, come hither brother, what would you doe to a dogge that would bite you? The Religious anſweared that he would cry att him and make him fly. Br. Giles replyed, doe the like to him that tempteth you, and I will pray to God to aſsiſt and encourage you therin whervpon the Religious awaking, he found himſelfe fully comforted and deliuered of his trouble ſome temptation. Other Religious were alſo in ſuch ſort moleſted with the like temptations, that they became euen deſperate and in tearmes to leaue the Order▪ neuertheles they were deliuered by the wordes and prayers of Br. Giles.
                  A Religious came one time full of ioy and contentment vnto him vpon a victory gottē againſt a tēptation of the fleſh
                        •
                      for he had perceaued &amp; heard a woman come behinde him, which cauſed him a very grieuous

temptation, and the neerer ſhe came vnto him, the more did his temptation encreaſe. But ſhe paſsing before him▪ and he hauing attentiuely beheld her, was freed of the temptation. Br. Giles asked him if ſhe were old or yong: he anſweared, ſhe was olde and deformed. Br. Giles replyed

                  How Br. Giles went into Africa to preach to the Mores, with intention there to ſuffer Martyrdome.
                  THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe yeare 1219. wherin the greateſt generall chapter was held of the Frere Minors, S. Francis deputing and diſpoſing of all his Religious throughout all Chriſtendome and euen among the infidels, Africa fell to Br. Giles his lott, whither he haſtened with many his companions of one ſame ſpiritt. And to that end they embarqued themſelues with an Italian merchant, and ſafely arriued att Tunes; but the deuill by diuine pe miſsion preuented him in this ſort of his deſired ſucceſſe in this voyage: In the ſaid citty of Tunes there was an old More, a man of great authority with thoſe Pagans, whome they reputed a ſainct▪ he had for a long time opinatiuely forborne to ſpeake: but as ſoone as Br. Giles and his companions were landed, this More went preſently preaching and exclaming through all the ſtreetes and corners that certaine Infidels were arriued, who intended to condemne and calumniat their great Prophett and their law▪ and therfore counſailled and commanded them to ſeeke them out they being Chriſtiās &amp; to kil them. This cauſed a great rumour and tumult ouer all the citty, in ſuch ſort that in an inſtāt they were all armed and prepared themſelues to murder theſe poore Religious. But the Chriſtians hauing vnderſtood the cauſe of this inſurrection, and fearing the Mores would kill them all, they forcibly thruſt Br. Giles and his companions againe into the ſhipp, in which they came. But theſe true ſeruantes of IESVS CHRIST did not omitt to preach to the Mores out of the ſhipp: which putt the Chriſtians into ſuch a feare, that they commanded the Marine

                  AFter this holy Father had ſpent many yeares in the actiue life, in affliction and labours, it pleaſed almighty God to make him a new man, calling him to the repoſe of contemplation, and priuiledging him aboue all men of his time. The beginning of this his perfectiō was, when being in the Couent of Faleron neere Peruſia offering his prayer one night he was touch

In this inſtant he felt his members as dead, it ſeeming vnto him that his ſoule forſooke them and that being gon foorth ſhe already delighted and pleaſed her ſelfe in the ſight and contemplation of her ſo great naturall beauty, but much more of her ſpirituall, wherwith the holy Ghoſt had already endowed her, whereby ſhe appeared to her ſelfe more beautifull then all humane conſideration could comprehend, as himſelfe a litle before his death did teſtifie. In this extaſie we

                     e reuealed vnto him celeſtiall ſecrettes ſo great, that he would neuer diſcloſe them to any: and therfore he would ſometimes ſay: Happy is he that can conſerue the ſecrettes of God in himſelfe: and it muſt not be obiected vnto me that God hath reuealed them vnto me to the end I ſhould manifeſt them to others: for when it ſhall pleaſe him that I reueale them, he will diſcouer them vnto me by other meanes.

                     the firſt night of his being there, there appeared vnto him in viſion an Emperour that ſpake very familierly vnto him: this preſaged vnto him the diuine viſion of the glory which God communicated vnto him in that place, where ſpending the lent of S. Martin in very a

The S. anſweared him: Brother ſift and examine wel your ſelfe before hand: and ſo vaniſhed. Br. Giles perſeuering three entyer dayes in prayer IESVS CHRIST appeared vnto him before

                        •
                     y friendly Brother, how may I refraine from teares, that feare to 
                        〈◊〉
                      the ennemy of God? for hauing receaued ſo many graces of his Maieſty, I doubt I doe not ſerue him as I ought, and according to his holy will, wherof if I were certaine, it would be more gracious vnto me then death it ſelfe: which he ſpake in reſpect of the viſion and diuine reuelation that made ſuch alteration in him, and therfore he ſayd: Till this preſent I wēt whither I would, and with my handes laboured as I would: but henceforward I can no more follow my fantaſie, but muſt doe according to the ſpiritt that I find to conduct me. This feare in this holy Faher was like to that of S. Paul when he ſayd: we carie this (diuine) treaſure in earthen veſſels. Butt becauſe the certaine perill of the loſſe of an eternall and infinite treaſure, would cauſe a diffidence and deſpayre in any one by conſideration of his naturall infirmity, he added: we know that the preſeruation of the diuine treaſure conſiſteth in the vertue and power of God and not of vs. The ſayd Religious then tooke occaſion to comfort him, or rather the holy Ghoſt, for and by him with the ſaid ſentence of S. Paul, ſaying, that though it were expedient that the feare of God ſhould be alwayes in vs, yet ſhould it be there with faith and full confidence in his bounty, who as he giueth grace vnto his ſeruantes, ſo alſo he giueth them force to preſerue the ſame together with perſeuerance. Br. Giles being by theſe wordes comforted, he proceeded in employing his dayes in ſuch hight of contemplation and ſpirituall conſolation, as is not to be expreſſed, demaunding of almighty God, as a fauour, not to be ſo ouer-chardged, alleadging that he being ſo great a ſinner,

an idiot, ruſtike and ſimple, was not worthy ſo much grace but the more he reputed himſelfe vnworthy, the more did almighty God augment his fauours. There was a religious of pious life in the ſame Couēt, to whome God did ſome times reueale his ſecrettes certaine dayes befor that Br. Giles had the ſaid viſion: this Religious ſaw in viſion the ſunne to ariſe out of the cell of Br. Giles, and there-ouer to remayne till night, and he afterward ſeeing Br. Giles ſo admirably chaunged, ſayd vnto him B other, ſupport and gouerne tenderly the Sunne of God, and thou ſhalt be bleſſed.
               
               
                  Of the graces which God beſtowed on Brother Giles in the ſaid viſion.
                  THE XI. CHAPTER.
                  IF vnto any it appeare difficult to be beleeued, that Brother Giles ſaw almighty God, not only in imaginary and intellectuall ſemblance, but euen in his diuine eſſence, as this worthy ſeruant of God confeſſed, affirming that God had depriued him of faith: lett him read the epiſtle of ſainct Auguſtin vnto Paulinam, De videndo Deum, wherin he ſhall find that ſpeaking of the viſion of God in eſſence, he ſayth: It is not a matter incredible, that God permitteth this excellencie of diuine reuelation in his ſubſtance to certaine holy perſonnes before theire death, to the end their bodyes be buryed, he vſeth theſe wordes, before they be dead for their ſepulture, becauſe as they who manifeſtly ſee God enioyning his glory, are entierly and totally ſeparated from their mortall bodyes, in the ſame proportion it is neceſſary for thoſe that are to receaue ſuch a reuolation, to be ſeparated from their bodyes according to the cognitiue and ſenſitiue puiſſance, att leaſt to their actions: for this is in a certaine faſhion to be out of the termes of this life. Wherevpon ſainct Paul ſaid: Were it that my ſoule were in my body, or ſeparated2. Cor. 11. from it I know not, God knoweth it, it was tranſported, rauiſhed and eleuated euen to the third heauen. Brother Giles, ſpeaking of the ſaid viſion which he had, affirmed that he was therby ſo aſſured in the knowledge of almighty God and of his glory, that he had loſt the faith which he formerly had of him. He alſo affirmed that he was directly of opinion, that his ſoule entierly abſtracted from the body ſaw almighty God. After his death he reuealed vnto a Religious, that alſo in the ſame viſion he had bin repleniſhed with the giftes of the holy Ghoſt and confirmed in graces: and doubtlesly the merueillous effectes that remayned

in the ſoule of Brother Giles confirme this verity: for after this viſion he was ſo often rapt in extaſie, that there is hardly found any other ſaint before or after him to haue exceeded him therin. It appeared by his exteriour actions what eſteeme he made therof: for he ſeldome or neuer went out of his cell, but employed himſelfe in faſtinges &amp; prayers, ſhunning all idle wordes, and all fruitleſſe conuerſation: and if ſuch diſcourſes were forcibly vſed in his preſence, and that any would needes make him ſome relation to the preiudice of any other, he would heare nothing therof, affi ming that each one ought to be very wary andAdmirable diſpoſition to extaſie in Bro. Giles. reſpectiue not to offend God, his neighbour and his owne ſoule by ſuch diſcourſes. And on the contrary when he heard ſpeake of God, he was preſently rapt into extaſie, and remayned inſenſible &amp; as dead, ſo that the fame of this ſublime and ſinguler grace being diuulged and made knowne to all perſonnes, euen to the contry people and to children, when they mett him they would ſay, Paradice Brother Giles, and att the inſtant and very place where he heard that ſweet and gracious word he would fall into extaſie: in ſuch ſort as if the Religious deſired to talke with him of God and to receaue his conſailes and doctrines, they muſt be wary not to ſpeake of the glory of the diuine viſion, leaſt that being rauiſhed in ſpiritt they were fruſtrared of their deſire. And becauſe he liued ſequeſtred from the other Religious, Brother Bernard therfore as zealous of his neighbours good reprehended him therin, calling him but halfe a man, as regarding only his owne good. But Brother Giles anſweared, that it was more ſecure to content himſelfe with a litle then by attempting too much, to endanger the loſſe of all▪ conſidering that vpon a very ſmall occaſion a great grace is often loſt: ſo that one muſt be wary att ſuch time not to looſe that in laughing, which is not purchaced but with much labour and weeping.
                  Being one day in ſpirituall conference with Brother Andrew and Brother Grātian two Religious of pious life and his ſpirituall children, he told them that he was borne ſower times, firſt, out of his mothers woombe, ſecondly when he was baptiſed, thirdly when he entred into Religion, and fouerthly the day that IESVS CHRIST appeared vnto him, and manifeſted vnto him his glory. Wherto Brother Andrew anſweared that it was true, but if he ſhould be in a forraine contry, where it ſhould be demaunded of him if he knew Brother Giles, he might auouch that he knew thus much of him, that it was twenty foure yeares ſince he was borne, and that he had faith before he was borne, but had loſt it afterwardes: Brother Giles replyed that all this was true: becauſe, ſayd he, before, I had not ſuch faith as I ought to haue: the which alſo God did take from me and gaue me a more cleare and perfect knoledge of him and of his glory, and among many graces which I haue receaued

of his diuine Maieſty, this is one, that I haue knowne and doe know my ſelfe to deſerue to haue a cord faſtened about my neck, and to be in extreme diſgrace trayned through all the ſtreetes and publike places of the world, ſo to receaue all the ſcornes and deriſions that can be offered to the lewdeſt man in the world. Whervpon Brother Andrew made him this demaund: Tell me Brother, if you haue not faith, what would you doe if you were Prieſt, and were ſolemnely to ſing Credo in vnum Deum? It ſeemeth you ſhould neceſſarily ſay: Cognoſco vnum Deum patrem omnipotentem: and incontinently he was rapt in extaſie: all this he ſaid, not that he had ſimply no faith: but by reaſon of a greater light and illumination which God with apparant euidence had giuen him.
                  
                     How Brother Giles was rapt in extaſie before Pope Gregory the ninth.
                     POpe Gregory the ninth being with his court remoued to Peruſia, and vnderſtanding that Brother Giles, of whome he had heard merueillous thinges, was neere thervnto, he ſent for him as deſirous to know him. Brother Giles came preſently to Peruſia. But being entred into the Pallace of the Pope he felt himſelfe interiourly moued with the ſpirituall ſweetnes which ordinarilie arriued him before his extaſie: wherfore conſidering that it was not conuenient he ſhould in that eſtate preſent himſelfe before his holineſſe, he ſent his companion to make his excuſe. But the Pope not admitting it would know why being within his Pallace he would not preſently come to him: ſo that his companion was enforced to ſay vnto him: Moſt holy Father, Brother Giles hath deferred to ſalute your holineſſe for no other cauſe, but that by ſignes ordinary vnto him, he foreſeeth that comming in your preſence he ſhall fall into extaſie. The Pope hereto replyed: I come to Peruſia more for this only reſpect then for any other thing: and therfore bring him incontinently hither which was done, but as ſoone as Brother Giles had in great humility kiſſed the feet of the Pope, he ſcarcely began to ſpeake vnto him, but that he was rauiſhed in ſpiritt and remayned immoueable with his eyes fixed towardes heauen: which the Pope ſeeing, he ſayd: verily if thou die before me, I would ſeeke the knoledge of no other miracles to canonize thee. An other time the ſaid Pope goeing to the Couent of the Frere Minors of Peruſia to viſitt Brother Giles, the Religious ran preſently to his cell to aduertiſe him therof, but they found him in extaſie, which the Pope vnderſtanding, he went to his cell, accompanyed with many Cardinals and other noble men, who all continued a long time beholding him, and to ſee if he would retourne to himſelfe. But ſeeing it, would not be in ſhort time, the Pope with his

company departed much admiring and troubled that he could not ſpeake with him as he deſired. He commanded that his extaſie being ended, he ſhould be told his holineſſe attended him to dine with him, which was done, and at dinner time this good Father went to the Pope, whoſe feet he moſt reuerently kiſſed, and was with al curteſie entertayned. There was then with his holineſſe a gentleman that ſayd vnto him, that he had heard report of Br. Giles his gracious and ſweet ſinging, praying his holineſſe to cauſe him to ſing, therof to receaue ſome contentment and conſolation. The Pope as well in regard of his deuotion towardes him, as of his deſire to heare him prayſe God, ſaid vnto him: Sonne, I ſhould be glad you would comfort and reioyce vs in God, by ſome gracious and deuout ſong Br. Giles anſweared, doth it pleaſe your holineſſe that I ſing? which hauing diuers times reiterated, he retyred himſelfe into a corner, and was preſently rapt in extaſie. The Pope &amp; thoſe with him, deſirous to experience the force of that extaſie, they felt &amp; found him withour pulſe or heat. The Pope being exceedingly troubled that he had loſt the company and conuerſation of this holy Religious, ſharply reprehēded the gentlemā that had perſuaded him to cauſe him to ſing. The time of ſupper being come, and Br. Giles ſtill in extaſie, the Pope ſaid to the Cardinals preſēt: I am ſory this holy Father is not heere with vs: but I am reſolued to try in him the vertue of obediēce, whereof haue bin ſeene many experiēces in the Frere Minors: then cōming to Br. Giles he ſaid vnto him: Becauſe the Order of the Frere Minors depēdeth immediatly of vs, we cōmand thee vpon obediēce to retourne incōtinently to thy ſelfe. The ſucceſſe was admirable, for att the very inſtāt this mā of God that had bin entierly inſēſible &amp; as dead, ſtood vp right on his feet, and wēt &amp; fell on his knees before his holines, with deep humility acknowledging his fault. The Pope cauſing him to ariſe, took him by the hād &amp; ſpake vnto him: then Br. Giles, demaūded of him how he did; the Pope anſweared that thāckes be to God he was well, Br. Giles added: Holy Father, you haue great need of the help of God in the great &amp; importāt affaires which you haue. For I ſuppoſe that the inquietude &amp; occupatiōs of the ſoule in exteriour matters, are of great labour. The Pope anſweared: My child thou ſayeſt true: therfore doe I pray thee to treat with almighty God for me, that by meane of his grace I may the more eaſily carry the weight of this burdē. Br. Giles replyed that he would willingly doe it, and ſubmitted his neck to the yoke of the cōmandement of God: &amp; to that end inſtātly retired himſelfe from the preſēce of the Pope, to performe his obediēce, and employed himſelfe in prayer, where he was ſo rauiſhed in ſpiritt, that he retourned not thece in fower houres after. In the meane while the Pope &amp; all his cō
                        pany prayſed God in his ſeruāt, to whome he had imparted ſuch a diuine familiarity that he cōuerſed more out of, then in the world, though

he were as yet in this mortall fleſh. Now Br. Giles being retourned to himſelfe, his holineſſe ſat downe att table &amp; willed he ſhould eat with him: which was an incredible contētment to the Pope, who afterward cōmended him to a chāber to repoſe. The day following his holineſſe familierly diſcourſing with him asked him what ſhould become of him. The holy Father making his excuſe of anſwearing thervnto: the Pope againe vrged him att leaſt to tell him what he ſhould be. Wherto Br. Giles hauing likewiſe replyed that he could not anſweare therin; being ſtill preſſed by his holineſſe cōmandement he ſayd: holy Father, endeauour to keepe both the eyes of your ſpiritt alwayes very pure: the right eye cōtinually to contēplate high &amp; future thinges, wherin we ought to addreſſe all our actiōs, &amp; the left to order &amp; direct preſēt matters that are vnder our chardge, &amp; doe appertayne to the duety of our place and quality. He ſpake many other thinges of notable edificatiō which are not extāt, wherby appeared the great abōdance of diuine lighte imparted to this holy Religious. The Pope therwith remayned more edified then euer, and was enamoured of this ſainct, as being the true and perfect freind of God.
                  
               
               
                  Of the exerciſes, and of the affection Br, Giles had to the contemplatiue life.
                  THE XIII. CHAPTER.
                  THis true ſeruāt of God had his face alwayes cherfull &amp; ioyful, and whē he ſpake to &amp; anſweared any one, he alwayes diſcouered himſelfe to be full of ioy &amp; deuotion, and entierly eleuated in God, yea ſometimes he ſo exceeded in this ioy, that he oftē would kiſſe the very ſtones, &amp; did ſuch other like actes, thervnto cōſtrayned by the loue of his Creatour: and perſeuering in ſuch grace he was very wary not to contriſtate the ſpiritt of God which he poſſeſſed, ſo that it was exceeding troubleſome vnto him vpon whatſoeuer occaſion, to leaue the diuine cōuerſation and retourne to the cōſideration of theſe humane affaires. He deſired to entertaine his life with leaues of trees only, ſo to haue more occaſiō to ſhunne all humane cōſolation. Whē cōming frō prayer he mett with the other Religious, ſhewing himſelfe to be ful of ioy, he would ſay1. Cor. 2. Br. Giles deuout to the conſtitutions of the Church and to the Saments. in a māner as did S. Paul: The eye hath not ſeene, nor eare hath heard, neither hath it aſcēded into the hart of mā, what thinges God hath prepared for them that loue him. By which wordes he confirmed and enflamed the ſpiritt of the other Religious in the loue of God.
                  He held in exceeding reuerence and deuotion the ſacramentes of the church &amp; the diuine ſeruice. And if any diſcourſed vnto him of the cōſtitutiōs &amp; decrees of the Church, he in this ſort with great feruour prayſed thē: O holy mother &amp; Romane Church! Ignorant and miſerable as we are, we doe not know thee, nor much leſſe the zeale &amp; boūty wherby

thou laboureſt to ſaue vs. Thou art ſhe that teacheſt vs the way of our ſaluation, and directeſt vs in the right and ſecure path, wherin 
                        •
                     e that walketh cannot ſtray, but he that ſeeketh and followeth another, ſhall only find therin an eternall damnation. He was preſent att maſſe with exceeding feruour. All ſondayes and ſolemne feaſtes he receaued his Creatour, and employed thoſe dayes entierly in contemplation of the grace receaued: for goeing very early into the church, he would there remayne all the day in the company rather of Angels and Saincts thē of men. Celebrating the feaſt of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, and many other times in the feruour of his prayer, he hath bin ſeene rapt in extaſie and eleuated aboue the ground, the hight of three handfuls or a foot and a halfe.
                  
                     Of other ſuch extaſies of ſpiritt recorded of the glorious Sainct.
                     FIue Prouincials did at one time with great deuotion and reuerence viſitt this bleſſed Father with Br. Gratian his companion, who aduertiſed him of their arriuall, vpon knoledge wherof, he preſētly mett them, and hauing graciously entertayned them, he with great feruour of ſpiritt began to ſpeake vnto them, and beholding the heauen, with his armes opened as to play on a viole, he ſung in this manner: O Br. make a caſtell, hauing in it neither ſtone nor iron! O my Br. build me a citty without lime or ſtone! and thus ſinging he was rapt in extaſie. The ſaid Prouincials knew not the ſignification of the wordes: But Br. Gratian told them that by the caſtels and citties, he meant the holy Apoſtles and martyrs of the Primitiue church, who without the armour of iron and without the helpe of any temporall matter generously builded the houſe of God in ſoules: which zeale and intention had Br. Giles renouncing temporalities, to become a caſtell of the liuing God and a glorious citty, not of temporall building or ſubſtance, but ſpirituall, of pouerty and diuine loue. And becauſe they as Prouincials of the Religion were captaines and furtherers of this worck, he by this ſong gaue them a notable document of their duety in their vocation and office.
                     This holy Father being in the monaſtery of Agele by Peruſia, he after ſupper made an exhortation to the Religious in the refectory, with his ordinary feruour, and with ſuch ſweetnes that he enflamed the hartes of all his audience in diuine loue, yea his owne alſo, in ſuch ſort that he was rauiſhed and out of himſelfe in the middeſt of his Brethrē, where he ſo continued till the cock-crowing, and in the meane time he ſhined with ſuch a ſplēdour which enuironed him, that the brightnes of the moone which then was in full, was ſo obſcured that the ſhining therof being darckned by this new light, she appeared not in that place, which

put the Religious in admiration, who gaue thanckes to our lord for the admirable worckes demonſtrated in his ſeruant.
                     Brother Giles one day thus reaſoned with S. Bonauenture who was Generall of the Order: Father, God hath beſtowed many fauours on you that are learned, for you haue knoledge of many matters by which you prayſe him But what ſhall we doe to ſaue our ſelues, we, I ſay, that ar ignorant and idiots? S. Bonauenture anſweared: if God had giuen no other grace to men, but only ability to loue him, it would ſuffice: becauſe loue is more gratefull to God, then any other thing that can be offered vnto him. Brother Giles herevpon replyed: Tell me, Father, if you pleaſe, can an ignorant perſon loue God as much as one learned? he can, ſaid S. Bonauenture: yea I ſay more, a ſimple and poore old fellow may loue our lord as much as a Doctour in diuinity. Vpon theſe wordes Br. Giles went with great feruour into the garden, and tourning towardes the towne, he cryed out: Poore and caitiue old wretch, ignorant idiot and ſimple, loue thy Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, and thou mayeſt be greater then Br. Bonauenture. Which ſayd, he remayned three houresrapt in extaſie.
                  
               
               
                  Of an admirable diſpute held by Br. Giles touching free will, againſt Br. Gerardin, in the preſence of many Religious.
                  THE XV. CHAPTER.
                  THe venerable Br. Giles being in the Couent of Peruſia, a Romane gentlewomā called Seauē-Sunnes, that was very deuout to S. Francis both in his life time and after his death: for ſhe made her reſidence att Aſsiſium to beneere vnto his ſepulcher, came to viſitt him to receaue ſome conſolation of his energicall doctrine: there did ſhe find Brother Gerardin, a Religious of exemplar life and very learned, together with ſome other very ſpirituall Religious, who alſo came to viſitt Brother Giles, to heare of him ſome ſpirituall exhortation. Thus diſcourſing together, they fell into diſpute vpon a certaine paſſadge of holy ſcripture. And among many other ſentences alleadged by Br. Giles for proofe of what he maintained, this was one: He that doeth not what he can, often endureth that which he would not. Br. Gerardin deſirous to entertaine Br. Giles in diſcourſe, to gratifie the cōpany and for his particuler cōtentment, thus begā ſcolaſtically to argumēt againſt him: Br. I much admire that you affirme that a man endureth what he would not, if he doe not what he can, conſidering that a man can doe nothing of himſelfe: which is proued by many reaſons, wherefore I ſay, that the power preſuppoſeth the being, ſo that the action of the thing be

                     Gal. 6. according to its being. And ſo much doe the wordes of the Apoſtle ſignifie, where he ſayth: If any man eſteeme himſelf to be ſomething, wher as he is nothing, he ſeduceth himſelfe: whence enſueth that a man cannot doe any thing, ſith he is nothing: which I will proue vnto you alſo by an other reaſon: If a man of himſelfe doe any thing, it is either by his ſoule, or by his body, or by both together; Now I will proue that he can doe nothing by meane of any of thē. Firſt, he can doe nothing by meane of the ſoule alone, for it is moſt cleare that the ſoule ſeparated from the body can neither meritt nor demeritt: neither can he doe more by meane of the body only, becauſe the body receaueth all his operation of his forme, and without the ſoule it hath no humane being, ſo that much leſſe can it worcke, which is a thinge proper to the forme, and finally, yet leſſe can he doe by meane of the compoſition, that is, of the body and ſoule vnited together: and if he could doe any thing, it ſhould be by meane of the ſoule: But I haue proued that the ſoule being ſeparated from the body can doe nothing, and now I affirme that it can muchSap. 9. leſſe vnited with her body, becauſe the body being corruptible chardgeth and burdeneth it: as for example, if a beaſt cannot goe vnloaden, much leſſe can it vnder a burthen. Thus Br. Gerardin made his argument appeare very probable which procured to the audience an amazement and confuſion. But Br. Giles very prudently anſweared: My good Br. and friend, beleeue, I pray you, that you haue ſpoaken amiſſe: wherfore acknowledge therin your fault. Br. Gerardin hauing a litle ſmiled, acknowledged his fault: then Br. Giles againe: This fault is not of force. When the penance is not admittable and in due forme, no grace can be obtayned therby. But tell me, canſt thou ſing? Br. Gerardin anſweared he could: ſing then with me, ſayd Br. Giles, and drew out of his ſleeue a litle inſtrument made of willow, like thoſe litle gitternes or fidels wheron children play, wherof touching the ſtringes, he began to proue and demonſtrate the propoſitiō of Br. Gerardin to be notoriouſly inuallible &amp; falſe, thus affirming on the firſt: Br. I ſpeake not of the being of man before the creation. I know then he was nothing, and therfore could doe nothing: but I ſpeake of his being ſince the creation wherin man receiued of God a freewil, wherby he might merit or demeritt, meritt conſenting to good, and demeritt yelding to euill: ſo that you haue very erroniously ſpoaken: And I thinck you intended to circumuentScolaſticall diſtinction of Bro. Giles. 1. Cor. 13. me, for S. Paul in the place by you alleadged, ſpeaketh not of the nullity of the ſubſtance nor of the puiſſance, but of the nullitye of meritt, conformably to what he ſayth in an other place: If I haue not charity I am nothing. Neither did I intend to ſpeake of the ſoule in ſeparation, or of the body dead, but of man liuing, who conſenting to grace, hath power if he liſt, to doe well, and being rebellious▪
                     
to doe euill, which is no other thing then not to doe well. Where as you ſay, the corruptible body burdeneth the ſoule, the holy ſcripture doth not yet ſay that the ſame taketh away freewill from the ſoule, leauing her no power to doe good and euill: but the ſignification is, that it is an impediment to the vnderſtanding, and that the affection and imagination of the ſoule is imployed and entangled in terreſtriall affaires, therfore is it ſayd a litle before: The terreſtriall habitation depreſſeth the ſences diſtracted in many cogitations and in diuers ſcatteredSap. 9. affaires, which permitt not the ſoule freely to ſearch the thinges of heauen, where our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST ſitteth att the right hand of the Father almighty: becauſe the ſight is a ſubtility of the puiſſances of the ſoule, which are made dull and obſcure by the diuers inclinations and occupations of the inferiour and corporall powers. Thus did Br. Giles by order refute all the reaſons of Br. Gerardin, who much admiring the ſame, againe with affection and great deuotion acknowledged his fault. Brother Giles then ſayd: this is the acknowledgement of the fault, Brother, that auaileth and ſtriketh the ſtroake. But will you that I yet more manifeſtly demonſtrate that a creature can doe ſomewhat? Brother Gerardin anſweared, Father I heſeech you: Brother Giles then getting vp on a graue, cryed out: O thou damned that art tormented in hell! Then himſelfe in the perſonne of the damned with a lamentable, horrible and terrible voice that made thoſe preſent to tremble, anſweared: Oh that I am miſerable! that I am wretched and accurſed! then aſſuming his ordinary voice he proceeded: Tell me caitife, wherfore art thou damned? And taking againe that lamentable voice he anſweared himſelfe. Becauſe I haue not done the good I could, nor ſhunned and auoyded the euill as I might haue done. He asked him againe in his naturall voice: Thou damned wretch, what wouldeſt thou doe, or what wouldeſt thou giue, if it were permitted thee to doe penāce? He anſweared in the gaſtly voice: if al the world were mine, I would giue it and would content my ſelfe to dwell in a fire for many worldes, prouided that it were ſuch as by litle and litle I could endure, only to auoyd eternall death: for ſo my paynes ſhould one day att leaſt haue end, but my damnation is eternall. Which ſaid, he retourned towardes Brother Gerardin, and ſayd: Well, haue you heard, Br. haue you heard, how a creature hath power to good or euill? And after many other ſpirituall diſcourſes, Brother Giles ſaid to Br. Gerardin: Brother that you may not eſteeme this to be a fiction, tell me, if a drop of water fall into the ſea; doth it then giue a name to the ſea, or the ſea to it? He anſweared, that the ſubſtance of the drop of water being ſwallowed vp, it tooke denomination of the ſea, and not the ſea of it.
                  
                     
Br. Giles replyed: You haue reaſon; and for proofe therof he was in the very inſtant rapt into extaſie, ſo that he demonſtrated by effect, that his ſoule caſting it ſelfe into the profound ocean of the diuine loue and glory, being entierly ſwallowed vp in God, changed her eſſence of grace, into that of glory.
               
               
                  How the bleſſed Br. Giles had the ſpirit of Propheſie.
                  THE XVI. CHAPTER.
                  A Dominican Frere being Doctor of diuinity was aſſaulted with a grieuous temptation, for the deuil would put him in doubt of the moſt pure virginity of the virgin Mother of God; wherin whatſoeuer remedy he applyed, nothing did auayle him: and perceauing that his learning nor vertuous exerciſes would nothing profitt him, he much deſired to be aſsiſted by ſome ſpirituall perſonne that could deliuer him of this grieuous affliction. Wherfore hauing heard the ſame of the vertue of Br. Giles, and that he was a Religious illuminated of God, he repayred vnto him, and att the ſame time the holy Ghoſt reuealed vnto Br. Giles the comming of this diuine and the occaſion therof, wherfore he went out of his cell and mett him. And entertayning him curteouſly, before the Religious began to ſpeake, he ſayd vnto him: Br. Preacher, ſhe was a virgin before her child birth, then with a litle ſtick which he had in his hand he ſtroake the ground, and preſently there did ſpring vp a faire lilly, then he ſayd: Br. Preacher, a virgin in her childbirth, and likewiſe ſtriking the earth with his ſticke, there ſprung vp an other lilly: and thirdly he ſayd Br. Preacher, a virgin after her childbirth: and hauing touched the earth as before, the third lilly appeared. Then hauing made theſe three admirable demonſtrations, and the ſayd Religious being entierly freed of the temptations, the lillyes vaniſhed. The holy Father with all ſpeed retired into the Monaſtery, leauing the Religious full of aſtoniſhment and admiration, who gaue thanckes to God for his miraculous deliuery, from ſo troubleſome a temptation of the deuill.
                  Certaine Frere Minors determining to make a well on a mountaine neere to Peruſia where Br. Giles was reſident, and not according together touching the place, they repayred to him for his aduice, and preſently tooke a ſtaffe, &amp; went to the place that God had inſpired him, where ſtriking the ground with his ſtaffe, there ſprung vp a moſt delightfull violett, and then he willed the Religious to dig there: which vpon ſight of that miracle they did, and there found abondance of water wholſome and pleaſant to drinck, and ſo they finiſhed their well to relieue their neceſsity.
               
               
                  
                  How Br. Giles was viſited by S. Lewes king of France, and what paſſed betwene them.
                  THE XVII. CHAPTER.
                  S. Lewes the ninth of that name, and fortie fourth king of France, goeing in Pilgrimage to Rome there to viſitt the holy Apoſtles, determined to ſee Br. Giles, of whoſe ſanctity he had heard notable report: being therfore att Peruſia, he went to the monaſtery of the Frere Minors with ſome few of his neereſt fauourites, all veſted in pilgrimes weedes, where arriuing, he told he Porter that the deſired a word or two with Br. Giles: the Porter deliuered his meſſage that certaine Pilgrimes were att the gate, of whome one deſired to ſpeake with him. Br. Giles vnderſtanding by reuelation who it was that demaunded for him, he full of feruour of ſpiritt went incontinently out of his cell: and comming to the gate, the king and he fell both on their knees, and very louingly embraced each other, with entertainement of moſt deuout and pious mutuall kiſſes in the face, as if their had bin a very inward and ancient amity betweene them. After they had thus ſome time remayned, and had ſhewen many mutuall tokens of charity, they ſeparated themſelues in ſilence without the vtterance of one word betweene them. Now whiles theſe two SS. were vnited in ſo ſpirituall a contentment, the Porter demaunded of one of the kinges followers, who that Pilgrime was that with ſuch great familiarity embraced Br. Giles: who anſweared him that it was Lewes king of France, who goeing to viſitt the holy Reliques of Rome, tooke in his way the viſitation of Br. Giles. The Religious vnderſtanding who he was, were exceedingly troubled, becauſe they had ſeene Br. Giles not only, not to haue giuen him the reuerence due to ſo great a King, but euen, not to haue vttered ſo much as one word; and therfore they went expresly to the holy Father, whome they ſharpely checked and reprehended for this great errour, that ſhould in no ſort haue bin committed againſt ſo puiſſant a Prince, being alſo a Chriſtian endwed with ſo religious a deuotion and manſuetude, as that he came expresly to receaue of him ſome conſolation. Hereunto Br. Giles anſweared: Trouble not your ſelues deere Brothers, nor doe you admire, if you ſee me not ſpeake to the king nor he to me; For when we embraced each other, the diuine light manifeſted vnto vs the interiour of our hartes, reuealing the ſecrets of his to me, and of mine to him: and hauing fixed the eyes of our ſoules in the reſplendant mirour of the eternall light, wherin euery thing is ſeene more perfectly then in it ſelfe, we diſcourſed together as much as we deſired, with an

extreme conſolatiō of ſpirit, without any noyſe of wordes, which would rather haue hindered then furthered vs, in regard of the ſweetnes that our ſoules did feele. With this anſweare the Religious being ſtricken into exceeding admiration and confuſion, they acknowledged their faultes among themſelues, repenting to haue iudged ſo admirable a worcke of God which they did not vnderſtand.
               
               
                  How Br. Giles comſorted and encouraged a Religious whome he had conuerted and brought to be of the Order, who complained that he shewed not himſelfe ſo gracious vnto him as before he receiued the habitt.
                  THE XVIII. CHAPTER.
                  AKnight much deuoted and friendly to Br. Giles, by his pious admonitions became a Frere Minor, but after he had taken the habitt, Br. Giles ſeemed to haue no more care of him, for he no more viſited nor inſtructed him as before, which was a great affliction to this Religious: wherfore he one day complained therof vnto him in theſe termes: Father, I am extremely troubled, diſcontented and doe admire att you, that whiles I was in the world, you tooke ſuch paine to inſtruct me in what was neceſſary to my ſaluation, ſo that by your holy admonitions I am come to be Religious, and principally vpon hope the more commodiously to enioy your holy conuerſation, wherin I experience the contrary, and find my ſelfe much deceiued. For you giue me not now ſo much as one word, ſo that you neither counſaile nor inſtruct me any more, nor giue me any manner of conſolation; ſo that you ſeeme to haue vtterly forſaken me: belieue you therfore I beſeech you that my ſoule can receiue no greater contentment, then to vnderſtand by you the manner how to gouerne her ſelfe in this new kind of life. Whereto Br. Giles anſweared, Brother, ſith you are of the houſe and family of God, as my ſelfe alſo him, and that you and I as fellowes doe fight vnder one capitaine and lord, it is not conuenient for me that am your companion, to command you to doe this, and not to doe that; becauſe I know not whither the wil of God be that you doe a thing contrary to that which I may counſaile you, and ſo I may perſuade you to one thing, and God to an other. Thus ſpeaking he lifted vp his face towardes heauen and ſpeaking with his Redeemer in preſence of this Religious, with a very ſweet voice, and yet with feruour he ſaid: O my Lord IESVS CHRIST! how worthy and excellent a thing is ſanctity and chaſtity? how pleaſing to thy diuine Maieſty? how well loueſt thou the ſoule that poſſeſſeth it? how doeſt thou heare her in

the company of Angels? and in what manner doeſt thou recompenſe her with eternall life? then ſighing with geſture that diſcouered exceeding contentment, he ſayd: Ah! ah! ah my God▪ how pleaſing and gratefull is ſuch a ſoule vnto thee? and beginning againe, he continued: O my God, how pleaſing is that creature vnto thee, who for thy loue ſequeſtreth his hart from the world, forſaking Father, mother, kinred, friendes and whatſoeuer he affected in the world? then diſcouering an extreme ioy, he ſighed as before, ſaying: Ah! ah! ah my God! how greatefull vnto thee are the obedient ſoules, that haue no other will then thine? O my God▪ how doth thy diuine maieſty loue him, that with all his hart obeyeth thy holy commandementes? and after theſe wordes, he ſighed as before, and then ſayd: O my God! how pleaſing is that ſoule vnto thee, which being eleuated in thy loue perſeuereth in continuall prayers, contemplating thy celeſtiall treaſures and graces: But how much is that ſoule comforted of thee when in her deuotions ſhe poureth out abondance of teares very gratefull to thy diuine maieſty, and profitable to her ſelfe, becauſe they bathe the conſcience, and open paradice vnto her? Ah! ah! ah my God! how pleaſing is that ſould, and how gratefull is that perſonne vnto thee, that for thy loue ſupporteth fatigations, labours and affrontes, and carryeth on him thy croſſe, not refuſing the burden therof, as our brother the aſſe, which complayneth not for being ouerloaden and beaten, nor when one ſayth, I would the wolfe had eaten thee, or that thou were fleyed: yea to ſuch iniuryes an affrontes he anſweareth not a worde, to giue me a great example of patience. Now with this new kind of ſpeech, this new Religious was exceedingly comforted, yea and extremely encouraged to perſeuerance in the ſeruice of our Lord IESVS CHRIST. And this may ſerue for a generall document to make appeare what feare and diſcretion is to be vſed by him that is to teach thoſe ſoules, whoſe perfect Maſter is IESVS CHRIST alone, who guideth them according to their capacity and the grace which he hath giuen them for their ſaluation, knowing that the inſtruction ought to be more of the ſpilitt and of God, then of any humane tongue, to touch and enflame their hartes in the pourſuite of vertue.
               
               
                  
                  How Brother Giles defended himſelfe from the deuill, by whome he was often perſecuted.
                  THE XIX. CHAPTER.
                  THe wicked ſpirites were the more hatefull and enuious to this ſeruant of God, becauſe he had knowledge and vnderſtanding of many ſublime and diuine ſecrettes: for which reſpect they often tormented him, as within few dayes after he had that diuine viſion, being alone praying in his cell, the deuill appeared vnto him in ſo horrible and fearfull a figure, that it preſently depriued him of his ſpeach. But hauing in his hart called for helpe vnto almighty God, he was incontinently deliuered: and afterwardes made very fearfull relationsThe vertue of the ſigne of the croſse and of holy water. of the lothſomnes of the deuill. Br. Giles being once entred about midnight into the Church of S. Appollinaris, in Spoleta, there to offer his prayers, the deuill lept vpon his ſhoulders whiles he prayed, and held him ſo cruſhed and oppreſſed for a time that he could ſcarce moue, yet he ſo ſtrugled that he gott to the holy water pott, where hauing taken holy water and ſigned himſelfe with the croſſe, the deuill preſently fled.
                  An other time as he was praying, the deuill ſo tormented him, that he was enforced as much as he could to cry out: help me my Brethren; att which call his companion Br. Gratian came running, and he was inſtantly deliuered. Praying alſo an other night, he heard the ennemy with many other deuils that were very neere him, who talking among themſelues as men might doe, ſayd: Wherfore doth this Religious labour ſo much, fith he is already a ſainct, ſo agreable is he to God, and euen in continuall extaſie. Which they ſayd, to tempt him and induce him to vaine glory. The laſt yeare of his life, the deuill perſecuted him more cruelly thē he had don before; as he thought one night after prayer to repoſe himſelfe, the deuill carryed him into ſo ſtraight a place, that he could not turne him on any ſide, whatſoeuer endeauour he made to ariſe. Br. Gratian hearing him complaine, came to the dore of his cell to know if he were in prayer, or that ſome other accident were befallen him, and he perceiued that he was exceedingly troubled, wherfore he began to cry out: Father, what is the mater? wherto this holy Father anſweared: Come quickly my child, come quickly. But Br. Gratian being vnable to open the dore of the cell, ſayd vnto him: I know not the reaſon, but I cannot open the dore. Br. Giles prayed him to doe his vtmoſt to open it ſpeedely: which, after much labour he did, then comming neere vnto him with all his power to aſsiſt him, he could not ſo

much as moue him out of the place where the deuill had throwne him. which Br. Giles perceauing, he ſaid: Br. let me alone in this caſe, and lett vs referre all into the handes of God. So Brother Gratian, (though againſt his will) for bearing to endeauour to deliuer the holy Father out of this place, he fell to prayer for him, where by, a litle eaſed, he ſayd to his companion: you haue done well in comming to aſsiſt me; God reward you for it. But Brother Gratian complayning that he had not called him in this imminent perill of death wherin he was, and relating the diſgrace it would haue bin to him, and to his companions if he had ſo dyed, he ſayd vnto him: Be not troubled my child if God by me be reuenged of his ennemies: for you muſt know that how much the deuill reſiſteth God, ſeeking to afflict and torment me, ſo much more is he tormented and diſcendeth deeper to the profundity of hell, and ſo when he perſecuteth me I am reuenged of him: for the ſeruice which I haue now done to almighty God, had no beginning of me but of his diuine Maieſty, as the end ſhall be, if it pleaſe him. Wherfore I am aſſured that the deuill neither can, nor euer ſhalbe able to preuaile againſt God: yet did not the deuill omitt to torment him, in ſuch ſort that goeing att night to reſt in his cell, he alwayes went ſighing asif he would ſay, I expect, yea I goe to martyrdome.
               
               
                  Of diuers anſweres giuen by Brother Giles vpon ſundry occaſions.
                  THE XX. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Iames of Maſſa a very ſpirituall Religious, euen in regard of his particuler grace to be often rauiſhed in God, one day demaunded of Brother Giles how he ſhould gouerne himſelfe in that grace: and the holy Father anſweared: Brother, neither augment nor diminiſh, and ſhunne the multitude the moſt you can. Brother Iames not well vnderſtanding him, asked him what he meant by thoſe wordes, and Brother Giles replyed: when the ſpiritt is prepared to be conducted into the glorious light of the diuinity, it ſhould neither augment by preſumption, nor diminiſh by negligence; he ſhould alſo with all poſsibility loue and ſeeke ſolitarines, if he deſire that the grace receiued, be well preſerued and augmented.
                  A Religious hauing asked him what he might doe that might be moſt pleaſing to God: he anſweared ſinging: One to one, one to one: the ſayd Religious alleadging that he vnderſtood him not, the holy Father replyed: you ought without any intermiſsiō or whatſoeuer

pretēce, giue one ſole ſoule to one ſole God, if you will pleaſe him.
                  Br. Gratian that had bin twenty yeares his companion and diſciple, teſtified that in all that time he neuer heard him vtter one only idle word. This Religious as the diſcipline of ſo good a maſter had exceedingly profited by his company in ſpirituall &amp; edificatiue mortification, and had receaued many other graces of God, wherin deſiring not to faile, he one time demaunded of his maſter, in what worck and in what kind of the graces which God had grāted him he ſhould moſt exerciſe himſelfe: &amp; this queſtiō he made becauſe he was abſolutely reſolued preciſely to follow his counſaile. Whereto the holy Father anſweared: you cānot be more gratefull to God in any other action, then in hanging your ſelfe. Which the good Religious hearing, he was ſtricken into a greiuous amazement, and with ſuch an anſweare much troubled: wherfore Br. Giles proceeding, ſaid: Know my child, that a mā which hangeth himſelfe, is neither in heauē nor on earth, but is only lifted frō the earth, &amp; looketh alwayes downe. Now doe you the like, ſith if you cānot be now in heauē you may neuertheleſſe ſo raiſe your ſelfe aboue earthly thinges (being exerciſed in vertuous works and prayer) that humility alwayes appeareLuc. 14. in you, and liuing ſo, hope in the diuine mercy. By this counſaile he commended vnto him two ſinguler vertues, prayer and humility, as ſpeciall graces of a Religious that deſireth to pleaſe God.
                  A certaine man talking one day with Br. Giles, ſayd vnto him: Father I am reſolued to become Religious: wherto he anſweared: if you be fully reſolued ſo to doe, goe firſt and kill both your parentes: which the other hearing he weeping replyed: Father I beſeech you oblige me not to committ ſuch euill and ſo grieuous ſinnes. The holy Father then ſaid; what my friend are you ſo ſimple and ſo ignorant as not to vnderſtand me; I meant not that you ſhould kille your parentes with the materiall, but with the mētall ſword, becauſe according to the word of our Lord, he cannot be his diſciple, that hateth not his father, his mother, his kinred and his Friendes.
                  Two Cardinals one time viſiting Br. Giles, to cōferre with him of ſpirituall affaires, retyring att length frō the place of cōference, they feruently beſought him to remēber in his deuotions to recōmend thē to God. Whervpon he anſweared thē, my lordes what need can you haue of my prayers, ſith you haue a greater faith and hope then I? The Cardinals admiring this anſweare, asked him what he mēt therby, he anſweared: Becauſe you with ſo much richeſſe, hōnours, delightes &amp; tēporall contentmētes hope to be ſaued: &amp; I with ſuch and ſo cōtinuall labours feare to be damned. Which ſo touched thoſe Cardinals to the quick, that they departed frō him very cōtrite in their ſoules, &amp; their faces bathed in teares.
                  A very ſpirituall Religious was troubled with a greiuous temptatiō,

and very humbly and deuoutly prayed God to be deliuered therof: yet could he not be heard. Wherfore he repayred to Br. Giles, who vnderſtanding his affliction ſaid vnto him: Brother doe not admire if God, of whome you haue receaued ſo many graces, will that you continually fight againſt this your ennemy. For when a kinge armeth his knightes, with better and ſurer armure, it is a ſigne that he deſireth they ſhould fight the more couragiouſly for him.
                  
                     Counſait and conſolation foo thoſe that pray which aridity of ſpiritt. A Religious one day demaūding of Br. Giles how he could goe with a good will to prayer, becauſe he ordinarily wēt without deuotion and very coldly: he thus anſweared him: lett vs ſuppoſe that a king hath two faithfull ſeruantes, wherof the one is well armed, the other vnarmed. He will that they both goe to warre againſt his ennemies; he that is well armed goeth with great ſecurity, as being well accōmodated and furniſhed of what is neceſſary for the battell: but the other ſayth to the king, Syr, you ſee I am diſarmed: neuertheles for the affection I haue to performe your ſeruice, I will not omitt in this eſtate to vndergoe this chardge with others. The king conſidering &amp; taking notice of the loue and fidelity of this his ſeruant, he cauſed preſently to be brought him ſuch armour as he wanted and was needfull vnto him. So he that wanteth deuotion, and yet aſsiſted with a ſtrong faith, goeth boldly to the warre of prayer, lett him be aſſured that our Lord will not faile to furniſh him, of what he ſeeth neceſſary for him to obtaine the victory.
                  A man asking his opinion touching entring into Religion: The holy Father thus anſweared: Tell me if a poore begger knew a great treaſure to be hidden in a field, would he aske Counſaile to goe ſeeke? whereto the other anſwearing, truely no: Br. Giles replyed: how much rather then ought a man runne to ſeeke and purchaſe the infinite treaſure of the kingdome of God? ſo this man with this counſaile departed, and hauing giuen all that he had to the poore for the loue of God, he preſently became a Frere Minor.
               
               
                  Of other like anſweares of the bleſſed Br. Giles.
                  THE XXI. CHAPTER.
                  A Certaine good ſpirituall perſonne ſaid one day to venerable Brother Giles. Father, I find my ſelfe exceedingly incombred, &amp; I know not what counſel to take: for if I doe any good act, I am preſently tickled with vaine glory; and if I committ any ſinne, I am ſo troubled that I am ready ſometimes to fall into diſpaire: The holy Father anſweared: thou doeſt well to lament thy ſinne, and to haue

feeling of the perill wherto it leadeth: but it ſhould trouble thee with diſcretion, conſidering that the power of God is much greater to receaueOne muſt not omitt to doe good for fear of vaine glory. thee to mercy, then thine is to cauſe thee to offend God. But the feare of vaine glory ſhould neuer hinder thee from doeing good deedes. For if the labourer before ſeed-ſeaſon ſhould ſay to himſelfe, I will ſow no corne, becauſe the birdes &amp; wormes of the earth may eat vp the ſeed which I ſhall ſow before it take roote in the earth, or when it is ſprung vp and greene it may be eaten by beaſtes before it ripen and be gathered in: if I ſay the labourer ſhould thus diſcourſe with himſelfe and conceaue ſuch friuolous difficulties, he would neuer ſow, and ſo conſequently neuer reape, whence would enſue that we ſhould haue no bread: but the prudent and wiſe labourer doth till and ſow his land and doth his endeauour, and committeth the ſucceſſe to the diuine prouidence: So ſhould you endeauour to proceed in good worckes without feare of vaine glory: for albeit it doe a litle trouble you for the time, the better and ſecurer part doth ſtill remaine vnto you.
                  
                     Grace doth profit more in Religion then in the world. An other asking him if one could obtaine and poſſeſſe the grace of God remayning in the world: he anſweared that he could: but I had rather, ſaid he, haue one grace in Religion, then ten in the world: becauſe in Religion grace doth eaſily encreaſe and is better there conſerued, a man being there ſequeſtred from the tumult and affection of worldly folies the capitall ennemies of grace: and with all the Religious his companions by charitable remonſtrances and by example of their holy conuerſation doe with draw him from euill, and inuite and induce him to goodnes. But the grace which ſome may haue in the world may alſo be eaſily loſt; becauſe the ſolicitude of worldly affaires and cogitations, which is mother of diſtraction, doth hinder and trouble the ſweetnes of grace, and other worldlinges by prophane and diſhoneſt conuerſations, by ſcandalous examples, and by diuiliſh hauntes and companies, doe diuert him from good and allure him to lewdnes: ſo that as it were by force they depriue him of his ſoules ſaluation, it being no part of their cuſtome to further a vertuous life, but indeed to deride and ſcoffe att ſuch as liue Chriſtianly, nor to reprehend the vicious and ennemies of God, but to flatter and ſooth them. Wherupon I conclude, that it is farre more 7s;ecure to poſſeſſe one grace with a helpe that may conſerue it, then ten with ſuch hazard, yea in ſuch imminent perill.
                  A ſeculer man hauing once requeſted him to pray for him, he anſweared: Brother pray for they ſelfe: for ſith they ſelfe mayſt haue recourſe and acceſſe to God, why goeſt thou not? why wouldeſt thou ſend an other on thine arrant? this man againe told him that he acknowledged himſelfe ſo great a ſinner, that he knew himſelfe to farre remote and

ſeparated from God: But he, being holy and well beloued of his diuine maieſty, had more creditt with him, and had alſo more occaſion to performe the ſame, becauſe he more often ſpake with God in prayer. Wherto the S. replyed: Brother, if all the corners of the citty were full of gold and ſiluer, and that it were cryed by ſound of trompett through the ſtreetes, that whoſoeuer would, might take therof, would you ſend an other to fetch therof, or would you goe your ſelfe? the man anſweared that in deed he would not therin truſt the beſt friēd he had, but himſelfe would goe in perſonne. Thus, ſaid Brother Giles, ſhouldeſt thou doe with God: for all the world is full of his diuine Maieſty, &amp; each one hath power to finde him, goe therfore they ſelfe with faith, and ſend no other for thee.
                  
                     A duiſe for pilgrimes. An other telling the holy Father, that he was determined to goe viſitt the holy reliques of Rome, he anſweared: ſeek firſt to know good mony from euill: therby inſinuating vnto him, that pilgrimages doe not indifferently benefitt all pilgrimes, but only thoſe that know and can diſcerne good and reſiſt euill; calling ſinnes and euill examples, bad mony, and vertue, pure metall.
                  
                     Conſolation and counſaile for the kichen. A Religious was exceedingly troubled that he could not ſo well accommōdate the diett for the other Religious as to giue them all contētment, and therfore repayred to Brother Giles to take his aduice how to ſupport with patience their murmures: the holy Father anſweared: Knowe you my child, what is beſt to doe? when the Religious ſhall ſay, theſe potage they are too freſh, or ſuch like thing, take a diſh-full of it, and eat it all, then make ſome ſhew to haue found it very ſauory, and ſay aloud; O excellent potage! the diſh-full which I haue eaten is worth an hundred ducketres: thus doeing in all other thinges, if you beleiue me, as I thinck you will, you ſhall ſhortly liue in repoſe, and ſhall conceaue ſuch cōfort: that nothing ſhall any more trouble you, but you will pray to God that they often ſpeake ſuch thinges vnto you.
                  
                     Frere Minors are Pilgrimes ouer all the world. Two Religious being expelled Sicilie by the Emperour Federick, a rebell to the Romane Church, they came to viſitt Brother Giles, who hauing with great charity entertayned them, he asked them whence they were, and whence they came, and they anſweared that they were Sicilians, and had bin expelled their contry by the Emperour, an ennemy of the Church: which the holy Father hearing, enflamed with zeale to their ſoules, he ſharply reprehended them in theſe wordes: what, are you ſo bold as to affirme that you are expelled your contry? doubtles you ſhould no longer call your ſelues Frere Minors, which ſundry times with a loud voice repeating, he with great feruour ſaid vnto them: Brethren, you haue grieuouſly ſinned againſt that great rebell to God, the Emperour Federick, of whome hauing receaued ſo great a fauour, you

ſhould alſo haue compaſsion of him, and pray to almighty God to voutſafe to mollifie his hart, and not murmure againſt him. And if you be true Frere Minors, you cannot truly ſay that he hath expelled you your contry, for Frere Minors haue nothing whatſoeuer in this life proper vnto them: ſo that this Prince hath taught you to be true Frere Minors and Pilgrimes on earth.
               
               
                  Certaine pious diſcourſes of the holy Father Brother Giles.
                  Firſt, a diſcourſe of the way of ſaluation, and of perfection.
                  THE XXII. CHAPTER.
                  IF thou deſire to ſaue they ſoule, ſaid the illuminated ſeruant of God, demaund not the reaſon of whatſoeuer befalleth thee by meanes of any humane creature. If thou wilt ſaue thee, labour dilligētly to remoue and ſequeſter thy ſelfe from all the conſolations and honours that creatures can giue thee: becauſe the diuels of conſolatiōs are the more ſubtill, and more miſchieuous then thoſe of tribulations: therfore alſo the falles of man are greater and more frequent by conſolations, then by afflictions and tribulations.
                  All falles &amp; greateſt perilles, arriue principally by bearing the head to high: as all good proceedeth &amp; is gotten by ſubmiſsion therof. Wretched are thoſe that ſeeke to be honoured for their vices and lewd behauiours.
                  If thou acknowledge to haue offended the Creatour of all thinges, ſupport with patience the difficulties and grieuances aryſing by each of them: for thou haſt no cauſe to complaine of them, ſith euery thing arriueth vnto thee from the hand of God.
                  If any one contend againſt thee, though it ſeeme iuſt to thee to gaine, yet looſe: for doeing otherwiſe, when thou ſhalt thinck to haue gained, then ſhalt thou haue loſt.
                  If thou deſire to ſee well, cruſh, and thruſt out thine eyes: if thou wilt heare perfectly, ſtop thine eares, and make thee deafe: if thou wilt ſpeake well and diſcreetly, cutt off thy tongue, and become mute: If thou wilt doe euery thing well, cutt off thy handes: If thou wilt make perfect vſe of all thy membres, rent them, cutt them off and ſeparat them from thy body: If thou deſire to liue, kill thy ſelfe: If thou wilt eat well, faſt: If thou deſire to repoſe and sleep well, watch: If thou wilt gaine much, learne to looſe: O what a great wiſdome it is to know how to doe althinges well! but this not permitted to all.
                  Grace and vertue are the true ladders to aſcend to heauen, as vices and

ſinnes are the way and ſtumbling block that tūbleth vs into hel. Sinnes are the poyſon and venime that murdereth the ſoule; vertues with good worckes are moſt perfect treacle and reſtoratiues.
                  Grace doth vnite and incorporate to it ſelfe other grace, and aſſumeth not to it ſelfe any vice. Grace will not be prayſed, nor will vice be checked or be blamed. The ſoule repoſeth in humility, whoſe daughter is patience. God ſeeth the purity of the hart, and deuotion taſteth him.
                  If thou loue, thou ſhalt be loued: if thou feare, thou ſhalt be feared: If thou accōmodate thy ſelfe to liue well with others, they wil comply to liue well with thee. Happy is he that loueth, and yet deſireth not to be loued. Happy is he that ſerueth, and yet deſireth not to be ſerued. Happy is he, that knoweth how to liue with all, and yet deſireth not that all liue with him: But becauſe theſe thinges are great, they that haue litle iudgement attaine not vnto them.
                  Three thinges are very profitable to man, and no euill can befall him that poſſeſſeth them. The firſt, if he voluntarily ſupport all the afflictions and croſſes that happen vnto him. The ſecond, if for whatſoeuer he doeth or receiueth, he the more hūble himſelfe. The third, if he ſincerely loue that richeſſe which cānot be ſeene with corporall eyes. Thoſe thinges which are moſt abādoned &amp; contēned by worldlinges, are moſt eſteemed &amp; honoured of God &amp; his ſaintes: For the ſinfull &amp; miſerable mā abhorreth whatſoeuer he ſhould loue, &amp; loueth what he ſhould hate.
                  This worthy ſeruant of God intending to declare to a deuout man the obligation we haue to ſerue God, vſed this paraboll vnto him: A mā
                     Notable diſcourſe of the obligatiō we haue to ſerue God. hauing neither feet, handes, nor eyes, had one day by a friend of his this demaund made vnto him: Tell me, what wouldeſt thou beſtow on him that ſhould giue thee feet? and he anſweared, that he would giue him an hundred duckettes, if he had ſo much. And if one would giue thee handes? he anſweared, he would giue him al his welth, moueables &amp; immoueables. If one would giue thee eyes? to him, ſayd he, I would oblige my ſelfe in ſeruice al my life. You muſt now thē, brother, that in this world God hath giuen thee feet, handes, and eyes, and the whole body, with all thy tēporall and ſpirituall ſubſtance: &amp; therfore thou muſt endeauour to pleaſe him, and to acknwledge ſuch and ſo many benefites, for which thou oughteſt to ſerue him all the time of thy life.
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of Faith.
                  THE XXIII. CHAPTER.
                  ALl the thinges that can be ſeene, related, or imagined, are as nothing, in compariſon of thoſe that cannot be ſeene, heard, or cōceaued.

All the wiſeſt and moſt holy perſonnes that haue bin, are, and ſhalbe, who haue ſpoaken and ſhall ſpeake of God haue ſayd nothing nor can ſay any thing in compariſon of what he is, no more then the point of a needle in reſpect of the heauens, the earth, and all the creatures therein contayned, yea a thouſand times leſſe.
                  Two Religious of the Order of S. Dominick, one day viſiting Brother Giles, and diſcourſing which him of faith, one of them ſayd: ſainct Iohn the Euangeliſt hath recorded many merueilous thinges of God. Wherto the holy Father anſweared: Brother, S. Iohn hath ſayd nothing of God: The Religious replyed Father, conſider well, if you pleaſe, what you ſay; for S. Auguſtin is of opinion that if S. Iohn had ſpoaken more highly of God, no mortall man could▪ aue vnderſtood him. Br. Giles then againe, I tell you brother, and once againe I tell you, that S. Iohn hath ſaid litle or nothing of God. Theſe Religious being much troubled and ſcandalized att the holy Father would needes be gon, and tourning away, Br. Giles ſtayed them and ſhewed them a very high mountaine whereon was the oratory of Cettone, neere where vnto they then were, and ſayd vnto them: If there were one mountaine made of a thouſand together ſo great as that you ſee, and att the foot therof a litle bird did eat of it, tell me, brethren, I pray you, how much would he diminiſh of that mountaine euery day, euery month euery yeare, yea in an hundred yeares; they anſweared him, that in a thouſand yeares he would conſume ſo litle as ſhould not be perceaued. The holy Father thervpō inferred: Know you my Brethren, that the eternall diuinity is ſo immenſiue, and is a mountaine of ſuch eminent hight, that S. Iohn who was as a bird, hath ſaid litle or nothing in compariſon of the greatnes of God. Theſe Religious acknowledgeing how prudently Brother Giles had ſpoaken, fell att his feet, confeſsing their errours: and ſo retourned exceedingly edified.
                  
                     A pregnant argument againſt the infidelity of couetous perſons. Br. Giles one day diſcourſing of ſpirituall matters with a lawyer that was a Iudge in ſome place. O Iudge, ſayd he, beleeue you that the recompenſes which God promiſeth his ſeruantes are great? the Iudge anſweared, he did. Br. Giles proceeding, ſayd: I will proue that you doe not. How much are you worth? the iudge anſweared: about a thouſād crownes. Well, ſaid the Father, ſe now how you beleeue it only in wordes; for tel me, if you could giue your thouſand crownes for an hūdred thouſand, would you not eſteeme it a great gaine, &amp; would you not preſently employ them? I beleeue you would, and yet you will not giue them for the kingdome of heauen. What followeth then, but that you doe not much eſteeme, nor much valew the glory of the heauenly kingdome, in regard of the friuolous follies of this world? And the reaſon is, becauſe you haue no liuely faith. Yet the Iudge vnwilling to yeld, replyed

to Br. Giles: Father, beleeue you that euery one worcketh as much as he beleeueth? the holy Father anſweared: he that beleeueth well and perfectly, worcketh and perfo
                        •
                     meth worckes correſpondente, as did the ſainctes, who did all the good they could, and haue accompliſhed, by pious deſires what they could not performe in effect. And if one haue a perfect and liuely fai
                        •
                     h, he would arriue to that eſtate, as God would giue him a perfect knowledge and aſſurance euen of diuine thinges, as ſayth the Apoſtle to the Romanes: I am ſure that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, neither thinges preſent, norRom. 8. things to come neither might, nor height, nor depth, nor other creature ſhalbe able to ſeparate vs from the charity of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord. And the man that aſſuredly hopeth this eternall &amp; ſoueraine recompence, doth not regard any afflictiō: as on the contrary no good can ſatisfie him that deſpaireth of the eternal good▪ in ſo much as a ſinner ſhould neuer deſpaire of the mercy of God whiles he hath life; cō
                     ſideringNone ought to deſpaire. that there is no tree ſo thorny &amp; diſordered, but men if they liſt can prune and rectifie it. Much leſſe can there be ſo great a ſinner in the world, as that God cannot adorne him with his graces and vertues.
               
               
                  A diſcours of Charity, and of what the Prophet meant when he ſaid, that all his friendes did deceaue him.
                  THE XXIV. CHAPTER.
                  CHarity is the principall of all the vertues: happy is he that feeleth not in himſelfe any diſguſt of the thinges which he ought alwayes to deſire. Brother Giles put this queſtion to a Religious with whome he was very familier: doe you beleeue that I loue you? the Religious anſweared he did. Wel then, ſaid the holy Father, beleeue it no more: for a creature ought not ſincerely to loue but the Creatour, who is pure and infinite. An other Religious ſaid to the holy Father: I beſeech you Father, make me vnderſtād how that muſt be interpreted which the Prophet ſaith: Euery friend deceiueth. Wherto he anſweared: I deceiueIerem. 9. you, in that I doe not ſearch your good as I doe mine owne. For the more I repute your good to be mine owne, the leſſe ſhall I deceaue you, &amp; the more a man reioyceth att his neighbours good, the more doth himſelfe participate therin: &amp; therfore if you deſire to participate therof, ſtriue to reioyce therat, &amp; to procure Charity is the trueſt &amp; moſt ſure way of ſaluation, ſith that therby one doth not only reioyce att the good of his neighbour, but is alſo grieued att his croſſes: he beleeueth and iudgeth well of others, and euill of himſelfe: he honoureth others, and miſpriſeth himſelfe. He that will not honour an other, ſhall not be honoured,

and he that knoweth not himſelfe ſhall not be knowne: he that will not weary himſelfe, ſhall not repoſe: alſo the greateſt of all labours and the moſt meritorious, is to labour in piety and benignity: he that doeth a good worck without loue and charity, is not gratefull to God nor to his ſainctes: but he that for the loue of God maketh himſelfe poore of temporall ſubſtance, ſhalbe rich of ſuch as are celeſtial. A man then ought to chooſe and loue diuine thinges and miſpriſe particuler thinges, for what can be greater then to know how to prayſe the benefitts of God, and to check himſelfe for his proper malice? I would I had bin taught in this ſchoole from the beginning of the world, and there would ſtudy to the end therof, if I were ſo long to liue, there to contemplate the prayſe dew to the benefites of God, and the reprehenſion and chaſticement due to my euill worckes. True it is that if I muſt committ an errour, I had rather it were in the conſideration of my wickednes, then in the acknowledgement of the benefites receaued of God. For if we ſee many that for ſome litle ſeruice done them retourne many prayſes and thanckes, how much more are we obliged in that kind of acknowledgemēt vnto almighty God? And in deed a man ought neuer to make any compariſon with this loue towardes him that hath a will to deliuer vs from all miſeryes and to conduct vs to the fruition of al good, and that would euen dye to procure vs to liue.
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of humility.
                  THE XXV. CHAPTER.
                  A Man cannot attaine to the knowledge of God, but by meane of humility, ſith that the true way to aſcend on high is to debaſe ones ſelfe. All the euils and all the ruines of this world proceed of pride, as is ſeene in the euill Angell and in the firſt man, wherof the one was created in heauen and the other in Paradice; which alſo may be obſeruedLuc. 18. in the Phariſie ſpoaken of in the Ghoſpel, and in many others: And on the contrary, all good that euer hath bin done, hath bin wrought by humility, as is remarqued in the moſt ſacred Virgin, in the Publican, in the Theefe, and others. But good God, why doe we not ordinarily carry on our ſhoulders ſome weighty burthen to cruſh downe our hard head, and to debaſe and humble it? A Religious one day demaunding of Br. Giles how one might ſhunne pride, he anſweared: Brother, waſh your handes, put your mouth where your feet are, conſider your ſinnes, and haue contrition for them, and then often incline your ſelfe towardes the ground. Wretched is he that deſireth glory and honour for his owne ſinnes &amp; vanities. A man is aſcended to an high degree of humility, when

he acknowledgeth that himſelfe is contrary to his owne good. I alſo eſteeme it a branch of humility to yeld to an other, and not to appropriat to ones ſelfe. I dare affirme that as one ought to attribute to God all goodnes as proper vnto him, ſo to our ſelues all euill. Happy is he that ſheweth himſelfe ſo vile before mē, as he is before God. Happy is he that walketh faithfully vnder the obediēce and iudgement of an other, as the holy Apoſtles did, after they were repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt. He that will haue peace and tranquillity in him, lett him repute al men greater then himſelfe. Happy is he that deſireth not to be ſeene in his wordes and behauiours that are commendable: but rather in the compunction and abiection wherin the diuine grace putteth him. He that is the holyeſt man in the world and reputeth himſelfe moſt vile, he hath true humility. Humility knoweth not how to ſpeake, and dareth not be talkatiue. Humility is like the brightnes of heauen: for as of the ſame brightnes and of vapours doe proceed thunders and earth quakes, wherof in an inſtant no more is ſeene, ſo humility doth ruine vices, wickednes, and the high toures of her ennemy pride, and then cauſeth a man after the performance of great matters, to repute himſelfe nothing. By humility a man findeth the grace of God, and peace with men. For euen as if a mightie Prince would ſend his owne daughter into a farre country, he would not mount her on a reſtiue and proud horſe, but on a gentle nagge that ſhall amble eaſily and ſecurely: euen ſo God as ſoueraine king, giueth not his grace to the proud, but only to the humble.
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of the ſeare of God.
                  THE XXVI. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy feare of God expelleth out of man impious worldly feare, and is the guard of thoſe goodes which cannot be expreſſed, not ſo much as by imaginatiō: But to haue this feare is a ſpeciall gift, &amp; not graunted to all. He that feareth nor, ſheweth that he hath nothing to looſe. The feare of God guideth and gouuerneth man, and cauſeth him to find grace with his diuine maieſty, by which whē he hath receaued this feare, he conſerueth it, and hauing loſt it, doth recouer it. All reaſonable creatures that haue forgotten themſelues in foule diſorders, had neuer fallen therinto, if they had this gift of God, which is proper vnto the ſainctes. And the more one is repleniſhed with grace, the more is he humble and fearfull. Now albeit this vertue is leaſt eſteemed of men, yet is it not therfore leſſe then others: for a man that in regard of his enormous offences committed againſt

God, is worthy of death, cannot haue any aſſurance wherwith to ſhew himſelfe in his diuine preſence. Happy then is he who acknowledgeth that to dwel in the world, is to be in a priſon, and that there one daily offendeth God. A man ſhould alwayes feare that pride conduct him not into hell. Thou oughteſt to haue feare of thy ſelfe and thy like, and to carry thy ſelfe reſpectiuely and warily: for a man that liueth in the middeſt of his ennemies, cannot be in perfect aſſurance. Our fleſh is our ennemy, which with the deuill is continually aduerſe to our ſoule. A man ſhould more feare to be ſurmonted and ouercome by his owne malice, then by any other thing: for it is impoſsible for a man to aſcend to the glory of God, or there to perſeuer without a holy feare. Not to haue it, is a ſigne of perdition. This feare cauſeth one to obey with humility, and to ſtoope euē to the earth vnder the yoke of holy obedience, and he that hath the greater feare, is the more deuout in prayer, and he that hath the grace to pray hath obtayned no litle grace of God. The worckes of men appeare they neuer ſo great, ought not to be iudged by humane iudgement, but according to the diuine will and inſtitution. Therfore ought we (my Brethren in IESVS CHRIST) euer to liue in feare.
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of Patience.
                  THE XXVII. CHAPTER.
                  HE that for the loue of God could ſupport with patience all afflictions, ſhould in ſhort time obtaine abondance of graces, and ſhould be Lord of this world, and haue one foot in the other. All thee good and euill which a man doeth, he doth it of himſelfe: therfore thou ſhouldeſt not be ſcandalized if one doe thee iniury, but ſhouldeſt rather haue compaſsion of him. Support iniuryes patiently for the loue thou oweſt to thy neighbour: how much a man is prepared for the loue of God to endure abuſes and affrontes, ſo great is he before his diuine maieſty, and no more: and how much he is feeble and weakely prepared to ſupport the ſame thinges, ſo much leſſe is he in the preſence of God, and doth not know what God is. If thou heare any one ſpeake ill of thee, aſsiſt him; if he ſpeake well of thee, referre that to God. If thou wilt make thy part the better, make it ill, and that of an other, good: I meane thou muſt praiſe the worckes and good wordes of others, and blame thine owne. If thou wilt gaine, looſe: for in the end when thou ſhalt thinck to haue gained, thou ſhalt find that thou haſt loſt, becauſe this way is ſuch, that though it ſeeme to lead to ſaluation, it tendeth to perdition. We doe not orderly ſupport afflictions, and therfore

are not fitt to receaue and ſupport ſpirituall conſolations.
                  Doe not wrong or iniury to any, and if it be offred to thee, ſupport it patiently for the loue of God, and in remiſsion of thy ſinnes: for it is more meritorious to ſuupport a great iniury for the loue of IESVSTo ſuffer iniuries freely is of exceeding meritt. CHRIST without murmure, then to feed euery day an hundred poore people, and to faſt much and auſterely. What doth it profitt a man to miſpriſe himſelfe, to afflict his body by faſtinge, to pray, to watch and to vſe diſcipline, if after all that, he cannot ſupport an iniury done by his neighbour, for which he ſhould receaue a greater recompence, then for whatſoeuer he could endure by his owne election? To ſupport tribulations and afflictions without murmure doth exceedingly purge the ſinnes of a man, yea more then doeth a great effuſion of teares: and therfore happy is he that ſupporteth all theſe afflictions patiently, in regard that he ſhall reape therby a great fruit of conſolation. Happy is he that neither hath, nor deſireth any conſolation from whatſoeuer creature vnder heauen. He doth not hope for any recompence from God, that is humble and peaceable, only, when althinges ſucced according to his will.
                  
                     A meane to get patience. He that hath alwayes his ſinnes before his eyes, will not faile to make his profitt of all the afflictions that befall him. Thou muſt acknowledge all the good thou haſt to proceed from God, and all the euill from thy ſinnes: for if one man had done all the good deedes that all the men in the world haue done, doe, or ſhall doe, withall that, if he duely cōſider himſelfe, he ſhall find himſelfe meerly aduerſe to his owne good. This holy Father being demaūded by a Religious what one ſhould doe, if thoſe great tribulations foreſpoaken by our Sauiour to arriue att the day of the generall iudgement, ſhould come to paſſe in our time, he anſweared: If the heauens ſhould raine ſharpe ſtones and flintes, they could not hurt vs, if we were ſuch as we ſhould be. Know brother, if a man perſiſt in his duety, all the euill that he can endure, will turne to his good: for as to him that hath a diſordered will, the good doth tourne into euill, ſo to him that hath a pure will, the euill doth tourne into good. And all good is interiour in man, ſo that it cannot be ſeene. The grieuous infirmities, great labours, and moleſtfull offences which we endure, cauſe the euill ſpirittes which are about vs to fly. If thou wiltThe exerciſe of the vertuous is to doe good, and to ſuffer euill. be ſaued, neuer ſeeke to haue iuſtice don thee againſt any creature whatſoeuer, becauſe holy and vertuous perſonnes thinck only how to doe well, and to endure euill. If thou acknowledge to haue offended God the Creatour of althinges, acknowledge alſo thy deſert to be perſecuted by all creatures, which reuenge the iniuryes thou haſt don to their Creatour. Therfore oughteſt thou with much patience to ſupport to be croſſed &amp; afflicted by all creatures, thou hauing no reaſon to alleadge againſt

them, in regard that thou deſerueſt to be corrected by them. The vertue of a man that conquereth himſelfe is in deed great, for therby he ſurmounteth all his ennemies, and maketh purchace of all good. It were a great vertue for a man to content himſelfe to be ouercome of all the men of the world, for ſo he ſhould become truely lord of all the world. If thou wilt be ſaued, labour to remoue from thee all hope and cogitatation of whatſoeuer conſolation may arriue vnto thee by any mortall creature, becauſe the falles proceeding of conſolations, are greater and more ordinary, then thoſe of afflictions. The nature of a horſe is then eſteemed noble, though he fly with great fury and dexterity, when he permitteth himſelfe to be guided and gouerned by the diſcretion of the rider that ſtoppeth him att his pleaſure, and maketh him goe whither he liſt. So when a man feeleth himſelfe ſpurred by anger, muſt he doe, and permitt himſelfe to be gouerned and directed by ſome one that is to correct him: yea he ſhould deſire to giue as a recompence for the loue of God all that he hath, to haue giuen him ſpurnes with the feet, baſtonades, buffettes, and to haue his beard torne off, haire by haire.
                  A Religious one day in preſence of Br. Giles did murmure att a rigorous obedience enioyned him: to whome this holy Father ſaid. Brother the more you murmure, the more you burden your ſelfe: and with the more deuotion and humility you ſubmitt your neck vnder the yoke of obedience, the more eaſy and light ſhall you find it: you will not be iniuryed in this world, and yet wilbe honoured in the other: you will not heare a diſpleaſing word, and wilbe one of the Bleſſed: you will not labour, and deſire to repoſe: But you deceaue your ſelfe, for honour is purchaced by reproach, benediction by malediction, and repoſe by labour: the prouerb being true: Troutes are not taken with dry handes: and therfore lett it not trouble thee if thy neighbour ſometime offend thee,Troutes are not taken without wetting the handes. Luc. 10. for euen Martha, that was ſo holy, would prouoke our lord againſt her ſiſter Magdalen, not without reaſon complayning of her: and neuertheles Mary was more ſparing of her membres then Martha in the vſe of them, but ſhe laboured more then ſhe in contemplation, though without Martha, Mary had loſt her ſpeech, ſight, hearing and taſt. Endeauour then to be vertuous and gratefull to our lord IESVS CHRIST, and ſight couragiouſly againſt vices, ſupport patiently afflictions, conſidering that there is nothing in this world of greater meritt, then to conquer ones ſelfe, and that it is moſt difficult for a man to conduct his ſoule to God, without this victory.
               
               
                  
                  A diſcourſe of Idleneſſe.
                  THE XXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe idle man looſeth this world and the next, it being impoſsible to purchace any vertue without diligence and labour. He that may reſt in a ſecure place, ſhould not put himſelfe in a place or doubt or danger. He is in a ſecure place, that laboureth for God. The yonge man that will put himſelfe to paine for God, doth alſo ſhunne the kingdome of heauen. And if endeauour doe not further, at leaſt let not negligence be an impediment and hinderance: for as idlenes is the way to hell, ſo good worckes are the way that leadeth to heauen. A man ought to be very carefull and diligent to conſerue the grace he hath receaued of God, faithfully labouring therin: for oftentimes the fruit doth periſh by meane of the leafe, and the graine by the huske. God graunteth to ſome, fruit, and a few leaues, and to others neither the one nor the other. I doe more eſteeme the conſeruation of the benefittes receaued of God, then the getting of thē. He ſhall neuer be rich, that knoweth how to gett, but not to keep. Wherfore many after much gaine, haue bin neuer the richer: becauſe they knew not how to conſerue; yet is it not ſo great a matter to know how to conſerue, vnleſſe alſo one know how to gett. There are ſome that gainning but litle, become incontinently rich, becauſe they know well how to keepe what they haue gotten. The riuers would not be ſo often dry, if running continually, they did not caſt thē
                     ſelues into the ſea.
                  Man demaundeth of God, graces without meaſure and end, and yet will make vſe therof with meaſure and end: but he that wilbe loued and recompenced without end, ought to loue and ſerue without end. Happy is he that employeth his time, body, and ſpiritt in the loue of God, that attendeth no recompence vnder heauen for the good he doeth. If one ſhould ſay to a very poore man, Friend, I lend thee this my houſe to make vſe therof for three dayes, in which time, if thou knoweſt how to employ it, thou mayeſt gaine an ineſtimable treaſure; this being aſſured and confirmed vnto him for moſt euident, would not he vſe all his endeauour to make this gaine? That which is lent vnto vs of our lord is our fleſh, our life, and whatſoeuer benefitt we can make therin, is in a maner but as three dayes. If the graine of corne doe not corrupt, it cannot only produce no fruit, but it alſo withereth and conſumeth entierlie of it ſelfe without any encreaſe: wherfore is it not better to make it to rott. to the end it may ſpring, be

gathered, threſhed in due time, and then layd vp into the garner of eternall life.
                  A man doth ſeldome take counſaile to doe ill: but being to doe good, the firſt thing is to take counſaile of all the world. The prouerb ſayth, one muſt not putt the pott to the fire in expectation of a promiſe: A mā is not happy for hauing only a good will, but he muſt rather with all poſsibility labour to accompliſh the ſame by good and pious worckes, becauſe God giueth his grace to a man to the end he follow the ſame.
                  A man one time praying Brother Giles to giue him ſome conſolation, he anſweared: Endeauour to doe well, and thou ſhalt be comforted: for if a man doe not prepare in himſelfe a place for God, he ſhall not find him in his creatures. What man is there, that will not doe that which is beſt, not only for his ſoule, but euen for his body in that which concerneth this life? I can truely affirme, that whoſoeuer ſhaketh off the ſweet and light yoke of our Sauiour, ſhall find it afterward far more painfull: and he that therwith burdeneth himſelfe moſt, att lenght ſhall find it moſt light.
                  Would to God all men would doe that which they may acknowledge to be beſt for their bodyes euen in this world: for he that made the other world hath made this alſo, and can giue to man in this world the benefittes which he giueth in the other, and the body feeleth the happineſſe of the ſoule. A Religious hearing Brother Giles to ſpeake theſe wordes, ſayd vnto him: Tell me Father, if you pleaſe, we may perhappes dye before we haue any experience of any good: The holy Father anſweared: The Furriers are knowen by skinnes, Shomakers by ſhooes, and forgers by iron: But tell me, Brother can a man be knowne by an art that he neuer practiſed? Thinck you that Princes and Potentates beſtow great fauours and prefermentes on ſottiſh perſonnes and without iudgement? there is no probability. Good worckes are the true way and meane to the fruition of all happines, as ill deedes to fall into all miſeries, happy is he that feeleth no ſcandall att whatſoeuer matter vnder heauen: and he that is edifyed with whatſoeuer he ſeeth and heareth, and that amongeſt all thinges chooſeth only thoſe that he may vſe to the moſt benefitt of his ſoule.
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of the contempt of the world.
                  THE XXIX. CHAPTER.
                  VNhappy is the man that ſetleth his hart, his deſires, and his hopes on earthly thinges, for which he looſeth all celeſtiall happineſſe. If the Eagle that ſoareth ſo high, had to each of her

winges faſtened one of the beames of the Carpēters worck att S. Peters in Rome, it is moſt certaine ſhe could not mount into the ayre. As I obſerue many that labour for the body, ſo doe I find few that trauell for the ſoule. Many take exceeding paines for corporall affaires, breaking and cutting the marbles, digging mountaynes, labouring the earth, furrowing the ſea, and performing many other painfull exerciſes: but who is he that laboureth manfully and with feruour for the ſoule?
                  The auaricious is like the Mole, that thincketh there is no other good but to digge the earth, and therfore therin ſetteth vp his reſt: yetThe auaricious resēbleth the Mole. doubtleſſe ther is an other treaſure vnknowne to the Mole. The birdes of heauen, the beaſtes of the earth, and the fiſhes of the ſea content thē
                     ſelues when they haue ſufficient to eat: but becauſe man cannot content himſelfe with what the earth affordeth, he alwayes ſigheth after ſomewhat elſe. It is certaine that he was not created principally for theſe baſe thinges, but for ſuch as are high and ſupreme, for ſo much as the body was made for the ſoule, and this world for loue of the other. ThisHe that hath the greatest part in this world hath the worſe. world is a field of ſuch quality, as the that hath the better and greater part therof, hath the worſe ſhare. This holy Father to this purpoſe alleadged that the holy Father ſainct Francis did not loue the Antes, becauſe of their ouer much care to aſſemble their prouiſions: but loued the birdes much more, becauſe they made no prouiſion to liue vpon, but depending on the diuine prouidence, made only ſearch from houre to houre according to their need.
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of Chaſtity.
                  THE XXX. CHAPTER.
                  
                     Chaſtity like to a glaſse. A Religious demaunded of the venerable Br. Giles, how a man might beſt keepe himſelfe from the vice of the fleſh: and he anſweared: he that will remoue a groſſe ſtone or beame, vſeth therin more induſtry then force: ſo muſt he doe that will preſerue his chaſtity: for it is like to a moſt cleare looking glaſſe, which may be blemiſhed and ſtayned in his brightnes by one only breath.
                  It is impoſsible that a mā can attaine the diuine grace, whiles he is delighted in ſenſuall pleaſures. Conſider althinges, behold, tourne and retourne vp and downe, and from one ſide to an other, you ſhall finde att lenght that nothing is more neceſſary then to fight againſt the fleſ
                        •
                     , which ſeeketh day and night to deceaue and betray vs: he that ſurmounteth it hath ouercome all his ennemies, and becommeth afterward aſſuredly capable of all happines.
                  He would ordinarily ſay, that if he were to make choice of the vertues,

he would chooſe chaſtity. Being asked what he called chaſtity, he anſweared: I call chaſtity the conſeruation of all the ſences of the body in the grace of our Lord.
                  
                     A man may be dronken with his owne tunne. A maryed man that was deuoutly affected towardes him, was one day preſent when he prayſed chaſtity, and ſayd vnto him: Father I deſire to be reſolued of you, if liuing with my wife, and keeping fidelity towardes her, I am ſecure touching this point? Br. Giles anſweared him: what, doe you not know that a man may as well be droncken with the wine of his owne tunne, as with that of an other mannes?
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of Temptation.
                  THE XXXI. CHAPTER.
                  A Great grace cannot be poſſeſſed in peace, but that there wil ariſe many contrarieties: yea the higher degree of grace a man hath, the more ſhall he be aſſaulted of the deuill: but a man ſhould not therfore omitt to proſecute his courſe of vertue, for the more violent the combatt is, the more excellent ſhalbe the crowne, when he ſhall haue ouercome. And if any doe miſſe this employment, lett him know that it is becauſe he is not ſuch as he ought to be; beſides this is to walke alwayes in the direct way of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, in which all trauell and diſpleaſure is ſweet; but a man that followeth the courſe and way of the world, findeth diſpleaſure and labour euen till death; ſo that albeit the more a man ſhalbe perfect in vertues, the more will vices be contrary vnto him: yet hating them ſo much, att euery vice that he ſurmounteth, he purcacheth a great vertu, and becomming victorious ouer all kind of vices, wherby he might haue bin tormented, he ſhall not faile of a great recompence for it, and vpon whatſoeuer occaſion he omitteth to walke in the way of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, for the ſame occaſion he looſeth his recompence.
                  
                     Compariſon of ſpirituall exerciſes with labouring. The burden of temptations, is often like to the trauell of the labourer that findeth a great peece of land which he is to worck vpon, couered with thiſtles &amp; thornes, ſo that he is conſtrained with great trouble to cleare the ſame before his labour be auayleable: in ſuch ſort that he often repenteth to haue enterpriſed ſo painfull a buſineſſe, in regard of the great expences and bodily labour that he is enforced to employ therin: For firſt he conſidereth that he muſt leuell and make euen all the hillockes that are vnequall with the ground, and therof ſeeth not the fruit: Secondly he cutteth or burneth the buſhes, thornes and thiſtles therin, yet ſeeth no fruit therof: Thirdly with much labour and ſweat he diggeth vp the rootes, neither yet ſeeth the fruit. Fourthly, he openeth

the earth with the plough-ſhare to cleanſe the ſame, yet hath no ſight of the corne that is the ground of ſuch his labour. Fiftly he tilleth it the ſecond time and maketh it into furrowes: Sixtly he ſoweth his graine. Seauenthly when the corne is ſprung vp he cleanſeth it and rooteth out the weedes: Eighthly he doth harueſt the corne into his barne: Ninthly with much labour and ſweat he ſeparateth it from the chaffe cauſing it to be threſhed, winnowed, ſifted and very diligently cleanſed: Tenthly and laſtly, he tranſporteth the corne into his garner; and for the contentment he conceaueth to ſee the fruit of his paines and labours, he then forgetteth them, and purpoſeth to vndertake yet much greater, for the only ioy he hath of his harueſt. Now the like effect is in the temptations and labours which one endureth in this world, for the ſpirituall fruit and contentment, which he is to reape therof in the life euerlaſting.
                  
                     Meritt of combatt with diſtractiōs. A Religious hauing one time conference with Br. Giles, ſayd vnto him: Father it is recorded that S. Bernard once ſayd his ſeauen penitentiall pſalmes, without euer thincking of other matter, nor was aſſaulwith any diſtractiōs. The holy Father anſweared: I would better eſteeme a caſtle valerouſly aſſaulted, and more couragiously defended.
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of Penance.
                  THE XXXII. CHAPTER.
                  A Iudge diſcourſing with Brother Giles of ſpirituall matters; asked him by what meanes ſeculer perſonnes might aſcend to the ſtate and glory of vertue. Wherto the holy Father anſweared: A man ought firſt to procure ſorrow and contrition for his ſinnes, then to confeſſe them with bitternes and griefe to haue offended God, and afterward to fulfill the penance that his ghoſtly Father ſhall enioyne him. So being in good eſtate, he muſt carefully keepe himſelfe from offending God, and ſhunne all occaſions that may induce him to ſinne, and finally muſt exerciſe himſelfe in good worckes. Bleſſed be the temporall affliction that conuerteth to a mannes happines, and accurſed be the pleaſure that tourneth to his miſery. A man ſhould endure and ſupport affliction in this world with a good will, ſith our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST hath giuen vs an example in himſelfe. Happy is he that hath true contrition of his ſinnes, and lamenteth day and night, nor will ſeeke his conſolation in this world, but where all the deſires of his hart ſhalbe ſatisfied.
               
               
                  
                  A diſcourſe of Prayer.
                  THE XXXIII. CHAPTER.
                  PRrayer is both the beginning and perfection of all good. PrayerInſtance requiſit in prayer illuminateth the ſoule, and by it good and euill are diſcerned. All ſinners ought to make this prayer vnto God, that he will giue thē knowledge of their owne ſinnes, of the diuine mercy, and of the benefittes receaued of IESVS CHRIST. He that cannot pray, knoweth not God. It is neceſſary for all thoſe that are to be ſaued, if they haue vſe of reaſon, to apply themſelues to prayer, to obtayne mercy of God. Lett vs ſuppoſe that a widdow and lady which were much retyred, ſimple and chaſt, had a ſonne, that for ſome crime committed were priſonner &amp; condemned to death: This Mother though honorable and retyred, would ſhe not repayre to the Prince, with abondance of teares to ſeeke fauour for her ſonne? This vrgent neceſsity, no doubt, for the extreme loue of this widow to her ſonne (though ſhe were very rarely ſeene to goe out of her houſe) would enforce her to runne through the ſtreetes, with cryes, weepinges and lamentations, to ſollicite all thoſe whome ſhe thought might any way aſsiſt her in ſauing the life of her ſonne: which ſhe would attempt without any feare or reſpect of the modeſty requiſite to her degree and quality. In like manner he that knoweth his ſinnes, knoweth conſequently to aske pardon for them with ſhame and humility.
                  
                     Humility neceſſary in prayer There was one that growing as it were into deſpaire, for that in prayer he receaued not the grace of God which he deſired, complayned therof to Br. Giles, who anſweared him: Brother, I counſaile you to goe on ſweetly, and to haue patience; for, as there being lees in a veſſel, one doth not therfore ſhake and entermingle it together with the wine, which were it neuer ſo good would be vtterly ſpilled therby: And as, though ſometimes the mill-ſtone grindeth not good meale, one doth not therfore breake it, but with time and patience repaireth it: ſo muſt you doe, and thinck your ſelfe vnworthy to receaue any conſolation in prayer: conſidering that albeit a man had liued from the beginning of the world till this preſent, and were to liue till the end therof, andDistractions in prayer are procured by the deuil. ſhould euery day in prayer power a quart of teare-water out of his eyes, yet ſhould he not att the end of the world be worthy to receaue any conſolation from God.
                  An other Religious demaunding of this his Father, why a man was more tempted in his prayer then in any other time, he anſweared: When any one hath a proceſſe in a kinges Court, and knoweth that his aduerſary

ſeeketh to gett ſome fauour againſt him att the kinges handes, he endeauoureth with all meanes and poſsibility to hinder his repaire to the Court: if he cannot, he procureth att leaſt that the king giue not eare vnto him, or at leaſt that he obtaine not his requeſt; and then vſeth all his indeauours to procure iudgement in his owne behalfe: Thus worcketh the deuill againſt vs. And therfore when you diſcourſe with any one, you ſhall very rarely perceaue the deuill to warre againſt you with his temptations: but if you goe about to recreat your ſoule with God in prayer, you ſhall incontinently feele the ſhottes of the ennemy againſt you. But you muſt not therfore giue ouer prayer, but with great feruour and reſolution perſeuer, for there is the true and aſſured way, leading to the celeſtiall contry: and he that for temptations omitteth prayer, is like to a coward that flyeth the combatt.
                  
                     Conſolation for thē that praye without feeling of deuotion. An other Religious ſaid to this holy Father: I ſee many that, when they are in prayer, incontinently obtaine the grace of deuotion and teares: but my ſelfe can neuer find any conſolation. Br. Giles anſweared: Brother, omitt not to continue prayer with your accuſtomed feruour. For if God giue not you his grace att firſt, he can giue it you att an other time: and that which he might haue giuen you in a day, or in a weeke, in a month, or in a yeare, he will giue you when he ſhall ſee it moſt conuenient and moſt neceſſary for you. But in the meane while faile not in your endeauour, and leaue the care of the reſt to the prouidence of God. For the maſter Cutler giueth many hammer-ſtrokes on the iron, before the endeth a knife, and then att laſt finiſheth it with one blow.
                  
                     One muſt labour for ſaluation. A man ought to haue great care of his ſaluation, ſith that if it were poſsible that the whole world were heaped vp with men to the very cloudes, and of all them only one were to be ſaued, yet not one ſhould omitt to follow his vocation and procure the grace to be that one: for, to looſe the glory of Paradiſe is not a matter of ſmall importance, as to looſe the lachett of a ſhooe, or ſuch other thinge. But wretched as we are, there wanteth not one to giue, but to receaue: the refections are prepared, but there is none ready to eat.
                  Many good worckes are commended in holy ſcripture, as to cloath the naked, to feed the hungry and other like thinges, but prayer ought to be in ſpiritt and truth as our Lord IESVS CHRIST ſaith. TheIoan. 4. holy Religious are as wolues, who ſeldome goe foorth in publike, vuleſſe vppon vrgent neceſsity, neither then doe they long remayne abroad.
                  A Religious that was very familier to Br. Giles asked him one time, why he did not more often goe abroad to viſitt the ſeculers that deſired to conferre with him. The holy Father anſweared him: I deſire

to ſatisfie my neighbour without preiudice to my ſoule. Do not you beleeue that ſometimes I would giue my neighbour a thouſand duckets if I had them, rather then I would giue him my ſelfe? the Religious anſweared, that he beleeued him. Beleeue you not alſo, ſayd the holy Father, that I would giue my neighbour foure thouſand duckets, rather then my ſelfe? The Religious anſweared, I beleeue you. Br. Giles then inferred: Our Sauiour ſayth in the Goſpell: he that forſaketh Father; Mother, Brothers, Siſters, kinred, friendes, and all other worldly thinges, for my ſake, ſhall receaue an hundred fold in this world, and in the other, life euerlaſting.
                  This holy Father ſeeing a gentleman, that was eſteemed to be worth threeſcore thouſand duckets, to enter into Religion ſayd: The retribution which God giueth in this life is exceſsiuely great, ſith that to this man is to be deputed and hundred times threeſcore thouſand duckets, but we are blind and worſe then blind, that will neither know nor conſider it.
                  This good Father on a time ſayd: beleeue me if we ſhould ſee a man repleniſhed with grace and vertues, we ſhould not ſupport the ſight of his perfection: and if a man were perfectly ſpirituall, he could hardly permit and endure to ſee or heare any wordly thing, or to ſpeake with any worldly perſonne but vpon vrgent neceſsity; but would affect to be alwayes ſolitary. He ſayd of himſelfe: I had rather be blind, then be the faireſt, richeſt, wiſeſt, and moſt noble in the word. This Religious asked him the reaſon. Becauſe, ſaid he, all thinges are apt to hinder my ſure way; &amp; this my blindnes and want of ſight, might be a guid and aſsiſtance vnto me.
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of ſpirituall warineſse, and of conſideration.
                  THE XXXIV. CHAPTER.
                  IF thou wilt taſt the chieffeſt good, thou muſt ſequeſter thy ſelfe from all ſenſual thinges: if thou wilt loue thy ſelfe well
                        •
                     , thou muſt hate thy ſelfe: If thou wilt liue well, mortifie thy ſelfe: if thou wilt be rich, make thy ſelfe poore; if thou wilt liue deliciouſly, afflict thy ſelfe: if thou wilt liue in ſecurity, perſeuer alwayes in feare: if thou wilt be exalted, humble thy ſelfe: if thou wilt be honoured, diſpiſe thy ſelfe: if thou deſire to haue that which is good, endure that which is euill: if thou wilt be bleſſed, ſupport maledictions. O how great is his wiſdome that can performe this! but becauſe they are great matters, they are not graunted to all.
                  
                     Conſider thy ſelfe. If a man ſhould liue a thouſand yeares, and had nothing to doe without himſelfe, he ſhould find buſineſſe enough within him, yea he were not able to cōpaſſe all that was neceſſary to be done. None ſhould deſire

to ſee, to heare, or to ſpeake, but what were a furtherance to his ſpiritual profitt, and vpon whatſoeuer occaſiō, ſhould proceed no further. He that will not know, ſhall not be knowne. But vnhappy are we if hauing the giftes of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, we doe not know thē: &amp; they that haue then not, ſeek not to haue them; a man imagineth God according to his apprehenſion, but God is ſuch as he is.
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of the Actiue and Contemplatiue life.
                  THE XXXV. CHAPTER.
                  AS no man can conueniently attaine to the contemplatiue life, if he be not ſincerely and deuoutly exerciſed in the actiue, wherin it is neceſſary that with all his cogitation he apply himſelfe: ſo he ſhall proue a true actiue man, who if he could feed all the poore of the world, cloath them, and ſupply all their neceſsities, and doe good to all churches and hoſpitalles, and this being done, each one ſhould eſteeme him a lewd man, and he knowing ſo much, ſhould not att all reſpect it, nor forbeare, but rather continue his pious worckes, yea ſhould the more voluntarily and with greater feruour exerciſe them; as one that deſireth not any recompence in this life: conſidering that Martha, careful toLuc. 10. ſerue our Lord IESVS CHRIST, demaunded aſsiſtance therin of her Siſter Mary Magdalen, and was reprehended of our lord, becauſe ſhe would diſtract her ſiſter from contemplation, who yet gaue not ouer her good worcke: ſo he that is truely actiue ſhould not omitt good worckes for whatſoeuer reprehenſion may be giuen him; ſith he hopeth for no recompence but in heauen.
                  A Religious came cōplaining to Br. Giles, that his brethren made him to labour ſo much, that he had hardly time enough to pray, and that for that cauſe he was determined to procure licence to remoue vnto an other Couent, where he might with more repoſe ſerue God in prayer. Wherto the holy Father thus anſweared: if you were in the Court of the king of Frāce, &amp; ſhould demand of him a thouſand marck in ſiluer, he might anſweare, what haſt thou don for me that may moue thee to demaund ſuch a recompence? but if you had formerly done him ſome notable ſeruice, you might with fa
                        •
                     re more aſſurance make ſuch demaund. Therfore if you will ſerue God, you muſt firſt labour in obedience; ſith it is a greater vertue to doe one thing att the will of an other, then to doe two, att ones owne pleaſure. Then he added: No mā can obtaine to contēplation of the glory of his diuine Maieſty, but by feruour of ſpiritt &amp; feruēt prayer, and then is a man enflamed with the feruour of the holy Ghoſt &amp; ſoareth vp to diuine contēplation, when the hart is ſo diſpoſed with the m
                        •
                     bers, that

neither can nor will thinck of other thing then that w ich it poſſeſſeth and feeleth. He ſhalbe a perfect contemplatour who, hauing all his mē
                     bres cutt off, yea and his tongue, would neither thinck, procure, nor deſire to haue any other member, nor whatſoeuer other thing he can imagine vnder heauen, and this by reaſon of the excellencie of the moſt delicious and ineffable odour and ſweetnes of contemplation. In that reſpect S. Marie Magdalē being proſtrate att the feet of our lord IES. CHR. receaued and felt ſuch a ſweetneſſe of his wordes, that ſhe had no member in her, that could or would doe other thing then what ſhe then did. Which ſhe ſufficiently teſtified, when her ſiſter complayning att the wāt of her helpe, ſhe anſweared nothing either by wordes or figues. But our Redeemer as her Aduocate and Procuratour anſweared for her: &amp; withall ſhe was imployed in his ſeruice more excellently then Martha was. Now to contemplate is to ſequeſtred from men, and to remayne vnited alone with IESVS CHRIST.
                  Br. Giles made this demannd to a Religious of his Couent: Brother what ſay the Doctours of contēplation? the Religious anſweared: they ſpeake diuerſely. Will you, replyed the holy Father, that I ſpeake mine opinion therof? the degrees of contēplation are, fire, vnction, extaſie, taſt, repoſe, and glory: then he added: a more expreſſe contemplation of GodNotable ſimilitude. with the ſoule cannot be giuen, then that of the Eſpouſe, with his Eſpouſe: for the Spouſe, before he receaueth his Eſpouſe, ſendeth her precious ſtones, iewels, and other ornamentes of price to adorne her: but whē they are together, the Eſpouſe leaueth all thoſe thinges to approch vnto her Spouſe: ſo doe good worckes and vertues adorne the ſoule as precious ſtones and ſumptuous attire, and prayer vniteth it vnto God.
                  An ancient Religious demaunded of Br. Giles, if the ſoule by extaſie and contemplation did ſometime euen in this life goe out of the body, and he anſweared, that it did: yea he aſſured him, that he knew a man yet liuing, whoſe ſoule being lifred vp in extaſie, went out of the body, and forſooke it, yea already vtterly forgetting the ſame. I beleeue ſaid the Religious, that ſuch ſoule was exceedingly grieued to retourne into her body. Br. Giles then ſmilingly replyed: Brother that which you ſay is true, yea moſt true.
                  This holy Father would often, in prayer and att other times with exceeding feruour, ſay: What art thou my God, of whome I demaund this? and what am I that aske it? I am a ſack filled with dung, with loathſomnes and with wormes: and thou art lord of heauen and earth. And thus beginning his prayer, he would be incontinently eleuated and rapt into almighty God.
               
               
                  
                  Of profitable ſcience and vnfruitfull, of preaching and the interpretation of thoſe wordes of the ſcripture: Ego rogaui pro te Petre.
                  
                  THE XXXVI. CHAPTER.
                  THe Venerable Br. Giles would ſometimes ſay lett him who deſireth to be learned humble well his head, lett him be exerciſed in good worckes, and lett him rent his body on the earth, &amp; God will giue him knowledge. It is a ſoueraine wiſdome to doe good worckes, carefully to obſerue the cōmandementes and to conſider the iudgements of God. He once ſayd to a Religious that would goe to a lecture att a Colledge: Tell me wherfore would you goe to the lecture? Know that the moſt worthy ſcience is to feare and loue God: theſe two vertues will ſuffice you, a man hath knowledge according to his good worckes and no more. Be not only carefull to profitt others, thou being obliged to be more carefull to benefitt thy ſelfe. We would often times know many thinges for others, and few for our ſelues. The word of God is not of him that heareth it, nor of him that vttereth it, but of him that putteth it in effect. Many not knowing how to ſwimne throw themſelues into the water to helpe an other that they ſee in danger of drowning; but hauing aduentured too farre, they are drowned together: ſo that wheras there was but one in perill, two are loſt by preſumption: In purchaſing aboue all thinges the ſaluation of thy owne ſoule as thou art obliged, thou ſhalt not omitt to aſsiſt others, but rather in doeing good worckes for thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt alſo profitt them that wiſh thee well. The Preacher of the word of God is a meſſager of his maieſty, to the end he be to the people a flaming light, a glittering glaſſe, a ſtanderd-bearer of his warryers. Happy is he that conducteth others by the aſſured way, that faileth not to walke the ſame way, and that inducing others to runne, ſtandeth not ſtill himſelfe: and ſo if he helpe to enrich others, he remayneth not poore. I ſuppoſe a good Preacher preacheth more for himſelfe then for others, and it ſeemeth that he who endeauoureth to draw ſoules out of an euill courſe to ſetle them in a good, ought to feare that himſelfe be not ſeduced from the ſame good way, and led to the way of the deuill.
                  A Religious demaunded of this holy Father, whither were better to preach well, or to doe well: he anſweared, tell me who doth meritt more, ha that goeth in pilgrimage to ſainct Iames of Galicia, or he that ſheweth him the way? I ſee many thinges that are not myne, I heare much that I vnderſtand not, and I ſpeake much that I

doe not performe; and it ſeemeth to me, that a man is not ſaued for ſeeing, ſpeaking and hearing, but for well performing that which he knoweth to be the beſt. Wordes are farther diſtant from deedes, thē the earth is remote from heauen. If any one would permitt you to goe into his vineyeard there to gather grapes, would you content your ſelfe with leaues? It is a thouſand times more neceſſary for a man to gett inſtruction for himſelfe, then for all the world. If you deſire to know much, doe many good worckes, and humble your ſelfe withall poſsibility. A Preacher ſhould not ſpeake ouer-curiously, nor too grosly: but ſhould vſe only common and ordinary tearmes.
                  Then the holy Father ſmilingly proceeded: there is great difference betweene the ewe that bleateth much, and her that bringeth many lambes: that is, it is not one thing to preach, and to putt in execution.
                  Br. Giles one day ſayd to a Doctour, that ſeemed to glory much in his doctrine and preaching: if all the earth were in the poſſeſsion of one man, and he ſhould not labour it, what fruit would he reap therof? Rely not therfore ſo much one your learning, albeit all the knowledge of all the world were in your head, becauſe not performing worckes neceſſary to your ſaluation, it would nothing auayle you.
                  This holy Father prayed a Religious that went to preach att Peruſia, to take for the theme of his ſermon theſe wordes: I kiſſe, I kiſſe, I ſpeake much and performe litle. This is in his life a litle before.
                  This holy Father expounding theſe wordes of our Sauiour IESVSLuc. 22. CHRIST, I haue prayed for thee Peter, I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not: and thou once couuerted, confirme thy Brethren: he thus interpreted it: Almighty God, ſayd he, would giue to vnderſtand that a man ſhould firſt labour for himſelfe, and then for others▪ And albeit the conuerſion of ſoules be very gratefull vnto God, yet it is vnderſtood of thoſe that can doe it without preiudice to the ſaluation of their owne ſoules, ſeruing God, as S. Paul, wherſoeuer they are. Therfore this holv Father would often with great feruour of ſpiritt, ſay: Paris, Paris, thou doeſt ruinate the Order of S. Francis. Which this good Religious ſayd, ſeeing the diſquiett and trouble of ſpiritt of many learned Frere Minors, that put confidence in their ſciences.
                  Br. Giles hearing a quaile and a doue to ſing, ſayd in feruour of ſpiritt; there is the way, there is the way, and not there: as if they ſayd, lett vs endeauour to doe well in this life, and not expect the other: with reaſō ſiſter doue thou ſpeakeſt this, ſo ſweetly groning. But ſinner wheron thinckeſt thou? why makeſt not thou they profitt of this aduertiſment? Beſides, it is to be vnderſtood that Br. Giles ſpeake this vpon the alluſion of the Italian
                        •
                      and Spaniſh tongue, with the note of the doue and

the quaile, which is, quaqua, which cannot be applyed to the French tongue.
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of good and euill wordes.
                  THE XXXVII. CHAPTER.
                  HE that vttereth good wordes is as the mouth of God, &amp; he that ſpeaketh ill, litle differeth from the mouth of the deuill. WhenWhat ought to be ordinary diſcourſe of the Religious. the ſeruātes of IESVS CHRIST aſſēble together in any place to diſcourſe, they ſhould talke of the excellēcy of vertues, that they may ſeeme pleaſing vnto thē, and giue them cōtentment, and ſhould alſo be exerciſed in thē. By which act they ſhall come to loue thē more, and to performe better actions: for the more a man is burthened with vices, the more needfull it is for him to ſpeake of vertues; becauſe by the frequēt and pious diſcourſe of them, he perſuadeth and eaſily diſpoſeth himſelfe to put them in practiſe. But what ſhall we ſay, the conditions of this world being ſo corrupted, that one cannot ſpeake good of good,Great vertue to know when to be ſilent. nor euill of euil? We will then confeſſe the truth, that we know not how to ſpeake of good, how good it is, nor lykewiſe of euill how euill it is. Wherfore it ſeemeth that neither of theſe to thinges, can ſufficiently be comprehended. So that I tell you, I eſteeme it not a le
                        ••
                     e vertue, to know how to be ſilent, then how two ſpeake well: and according to my iudgement, a man ſhould haue a long neck asNote this word. a Crane, that his wordes paſſe by many ioyntes, before it goe out of the mouth.
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of perſeuerance in good worckes, and of the memorie of death.
                  THE XXXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  WHat doth it profit a man, to faſt, pray giue almoſe, mortifie himſelfe, and to haue vnderſtanding of celeſtiall thinges, yet with all this doth not arriue to the deſired port of ſaluation? There hath bin ſometime ſeene in the mayne ſea a faire ſhipp loaden with abondance of wealth, which neere vnto the hauen, ſurmonted by a litle tempeſt, hath miſerably periſhed. What then hath auayled the brauery and richeſſe that it brought? But on the contrary hath bin ſeene an old veſſell, vnſeemely and contemptible to each one, that hath defended it ſelfe from the perilles of the ſea with her burden of merchandiſes, and ſecurely arriued in the port, &amp; ſuch an one deſerueth praiſe. The ſame happeneth alſo to men of this world, and therfore ought they to liue alwayes in the

feare of God. For although a tree grow and is faſtened in the ground, he doth not yet ſodenly become great, and when he is great, he doth not preſently floriſh, he is not ſo ſoone fruitfull, if he be, they be not ripe, if ripe, they do not in euery reſpect content the maſter. For ſome doe rott, other are beaten downe by the windes of temptations, and are deuoured by the wormes of the ſences.
                  Two thinges I hould for great benefittes of God, when a man hath his hart remote from ſinne, and repleniſhed with loue towardes God: which two thinges whoſoeuer ſhall poſſeſſe without danger of any euill, ſhalbe in poſſeſsion of all good: But he muſt perſeuer, becauſe if one had from the beginning of the world to this inſtant, liued in diſtreſſes afflictions, and now ſhould haue abondant fruition of all kind of ioyes, all the miſeries paſt would not offend him: on the contrary, if one had alwayes ſpent his time in continuall iollyty and contentment, and were att this preſent oppreſſed with diuers miſeries and infirmities, his pleaſures paſt would nothing reioyce him. Wherfore each one ſhould leuell att that, where althinges are to end and determine.
                  A ſeculer perſon hauing told this holy Father, that he would be content to liue a long time in this world and to be rich and haue his pleaſure in all thinges: he anſweared him: If you ſhould liue a thouſand yeares, and were lord of all the world, what recompence ſhoulde you receaue in the death of this body, which you ſhall with ſo great affection and pleaſure, haue ſerued; but wormes, ſtinch, and eternall death? Better were it for you my child, beleeue me, to endure a litle here, ſo to receaue in heauen that incomprehenſible recompence, which by no humane tongue can be expreſſed.
               
               
                  A diſcourſe of Religion and Obedience.
                  THE XXXIX. CHAPTER.
                  I Would more reſpect a litle grace from almighty God in Religion, then much more in the world: becauſe there is more perill and leſſe helpe in the ſeculer eſtate then in Religion, and yet a ſinfull man hath more feare of his good then of his euill, becauſe he feareth more to doe penance entring into Religion, then to perſiſt in ſinne in the world.
                  They that enter into Religion, and performe not what is conuenient to their vow, are like a common labourer that adorneth himſelfe with the armour of a braue ſoldier and when he muſt fight, knoweth not how to vſe it. I doe not eſteeme it much to enter into the Court of a king, and to gett fauour of him: but I much eſteeme, to know how to liue in a

Court as one ought and ſo to perſeuer: The Court of a great king, is Religion, wherin it is a ſmall matter to enter and to receaue ſome gift of Almighty God: But to know how to liue there, and to perſeuer in holy deuotion to the end, is a matter very laudable and eſtimable. Wherfore I had rather liue in ſeculer eſtate, with deſire to enter into Religiō, then to be Religious with wearineſſe and irckſomnes. The glorious Virgin Mother of IESVS CHRIST was borne of ſinfull man &amp; woman, and liued not incloſed in any Religion, neuertheles ſhe was, &amp; is as ſhe is. But when a Religious hath made profeſsion, he muſt beleeue that he neither knoweth nor can liue out of Religion. It doth vndoubtedly ſeeme vnto me that the Religion of the Frere Minors was ſent of God into the world, for a great benefitt and profitt to al men: but we ſhal proue extremely miſerable, if we be not ſuch as we ought to be. I eſteeme the Religion of the Frere Minors, to be the pooreſt and the richeſt of the world: but we haue this de
                        •
                     ect, that we aſpire to riſe to high: when a ſhippe is broaken by a tempeſt, though the affliction be great, he that can, ſtriueth to ſaue himſelfe. Conſidering all the Religions that are, and haue bin from the beginning of the world to this preſent, I find none ſo reaſonable, conuenient, nor better then this of the Frere Minors. He is rich that playeth the part of a rich man, he is wiſe that imitateth the wiſe, he good that imitateth the good; and he noble that is a true follower of our moſt noble Lord IESVS.
                  Vertuous conditions open vs the way to all happines, and vicious to perdition. And therfore the more a Religious ſubmitteth himſelfe vnder the yoke of odedience, the more fruit doth he produce; and the more obedient a Religious is and more ſubiect to his Superiour, for the honour and loue of God, ſo much more is he poore of ſpiritt and purged of his ſinnes.
                  A Religious truely obedient is as a ſoldier well armed, and as a horſeman mounted on a gallant Courſer
                        •
                     , who ſecurely breaketh through the middeſt of his ennemies without detriment. The Religious that obeyeth with murmure is as a diſarmed horſeman on a cowardly iade, that paſsing through his ennemies, ſtumbleth, and is taken priſonner. The Religions that ſeeketh to liue according to his will, deſireth to goe to the fire of hell. When the oxen ſubmitt their neck to the yoke, then are the corne-loftes full with graine: but when they run wandering ouer the fieldes and taking their pleaſure, it is a ſigne that the garners are empty. The more eminent and wiſe perſonnes yeld their head vnder the yoke of obedience▪ but the il-aduiſed and ignorant, retire themſelues and contemne to obey. The mother doth often bring vp her ſonne and rayſe him to honour, and the vngratefull ſonne diſobeyeth his mother and derideth her: Many Religious doe the like to Religion their mother

ther. I more eſteeme to obey a Superiour for the loue of God, then toParadox of Bro. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . obey God himſelfe: for he that obeyeth the vicar of IESVS CHRIST, with greater reaſon would he obey God himſelfe, if he command him.
                  He that ſubmitteth his head vnder the yoke of obedience, and afterward remoueth it to follow of himſelfe the way of perfection according to his fantaſie, he diſcouereth his interiour pride. Wherfore it ſeemeth to me, if one had obtayned the grace to ſpeake with the Angels, &amp; were att the inſtant called by his ſuperiour, he ſhould incontinently leaue his conference with the Angels, and obey a man, to whome he hath voluntarily made himſelfe ſubiect for the loue of God.
                  
                     To leaue God for to goe to God. Our Lord and Redeemer IESVS CHRIST hath made the verity of this doctrine appeare in Br. Andrew, my deuout companion, who being in feruent prayer in his cell, his diuine Maieſty appeared vnto him in forme of a very beautifull child, who by the ſplendour of his contenance, and the familiarity which he ſhewed him, filled him with an ineffable conſolation. But in the meane whiles it runge to Euenſong: the poore Religious then not knowing what to doe, reſolued to leaue his God, and went incontinently to the quier, ſaying, that it was the better to obey the creature for the loue of the Creatour, in this māner giuing ſatisfaction to both the one and the other. The ſequell diſcouered how pleaſing this his opinion was vnto God: for the euenſong being ended, Brother Andrew retourned to his cell and there yet found the litle child IESVS, who ſayd vnto him: If thou haddeſt not gone to the quier, I had preſently gone hence, and neuer retourned.

                  DIuine thinges make a man rich, and humane thinges make him poore. Wherfore men ſhould follow and loue the one and the other. For as all the wayes of the earth are full of vices and ſinnes, ſo they of heauen are full of vertues, which being prepared for creatures, call to each one, ſaying: come and entertaine vs, and we will teach you the way of ſaluation, but man miſerable as he is, hath no mind that way. Whoſe fault is it then if he liue in miſery and pouerty, ſith being called of God, he will not take the paines, to come to his preſence? wherby he maketh himſelfe guilty of eternall death. For as vertues and graces are the way and ladder leading to heauen: ſo ſinnes are the downfall deſcending into hell.
                  
                     
But it is very perillous to demaund of God vertues and graces, becauſe, if hauing receaued them, we doe not good worckes accordingly, we make his diuine Maieſty more our ennemy, and prouoke his wrath to chaſtice vs for our ingratitude: in reſpect that by how much greater the gift is which God preſenteth to his creature, the more vngratefull doth he proue that conſerueth it not. The more a man is ſurmonted by vices and ſinnes, the more ought he to hate and abhorre them.
                  By prayer a man doth often meritt great graces and vertues, for he is therby illuminated in his ſoule, and fortifyed in faith, he taketh notice of his miſery, obtayneth feare and humility, and purchaſeth a contempt of himſelfe: he getteth contrition for his ſinnes, the gift of teares, and amendement of his euill life. Prayer maketh the ſcience of a man pure, maketh him conſtant and ſtable in patience, and delighting in obedience, it maketh him perfect in mortification of himſelfe; it purchaſeth vnto him an aſſured knowledge, the gift of vnderſtanding, the gift of force, the gift of prudence, and finally conducteth him to the knowledge of God, who manifeſteth himſelfe to them that adore him in ſpiritt and truth: for a man by prayer is inflamed in loue, then preſently runneth after the diuine odour, and obteyneth the ſweetnes of delight, then is eleuated to repoſe of ſpiritt, where he is admitted to the glory of the ſweetnesIoan. 4. of God. When he ſhall haue layd his mouth to the word of the moſt high, wherwith alone the ſoule is ſatisfied. Who can euer ſeparate him frō prayer, which raiſeth and eleuateth the ſpiritt vnto contemplation?
                  And that they, who ſhall deſire to obtaine the afforeſaid thinges, may know to attayne therto, lett them, among all other well obſerue theſe ſix conſiderations, as moſt neceſſary, wherof the firſt is touching his ſinnes paſt, for which he muſt haue contrition: the ſecond, to be prudent in his actions preſent: the third, to foreſee thoſe to come: the fourth, lett him conſider the mercy of God that expecteth mannes repentance, not taking vengeance on him, though he haue made himſelfe worthy of eternall tormentes, according to diuine iuſtice, which he deſſembleth, in expectation of his amendemēt. The fift is of the benefittes of his diuine Maieſty, which are innumerable, as the incarnation, and paſsion, and all for our benefitt, the doctrine which he left vs, and the glory he promiſeth. And for the ſixt and laſt, he muſt conſider what our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST hath loued in this life, as pouerty, nakednes, hunger, thirſt, cold, humility diſhonour, contempt, trauels, wherin we muſt endeauour to conforme our ſelues, and to follow him with all poſsibility.
               
               
                  
                  Of ſome other ſpirituall diſcourſes of this glorious Sainct.
                  THE XL. CHAPTER.
                  THis holy Father was once demaunded by a ſeculer perſon, vpō what occaſion man ſhould be more enclined to euill then to good, he anſweared: It hath bin more apt to the earth, ſince the malediction therof, to produce ill weedes, then good hearbes. But a carefull and dilligent labourer, can by his induſtry ſo husband it, thatNotable anſweared to a curious parſon. thoſe weedes ſhall not eaſily grow therin.
                  An other putting him a queſtion of predeſtination, he anſweared: The water of the ſea ſhoare is ſufficient to waſh my feet, yea my whole body; and I eſteeme him a foole that this being able to content him, will caſt himſelfe into the mayne ſea: for I beleeue it ſufficeth a Chriſtian to know how to liue well, without ſearch into matters ſo highe. Then he added: you muſt pray to God that he giue you not too much felicity in this world, but that he ſend you great combattes againſt your ſences, and that therin he doe not aſsiſt you by the taſt of his diuine ſweetnes and ſuauity, for your greater recompence, and his greater glory.
                  Hereby may be diſcerned whither a man loue God perfectly, if with an earneſt care he endeauour to ſequeſter himſelfe from vices, ſeeking daily to augment in good worckes, becauſe it is a greater vertue to follow grace, then patiently to ſupport afflictions, for many haue patience, but follow not grace.
                  Frere Minor, is as much to ſay, as one vnder the feet of all men, and the greater the deſcent is, the greater alſo is the ſally. We ought more to feare temporall feclicity, then temporall euill; for the euill followeth man, and felicity is his contrary. We muſt ſo conuerſe with men, as we looſe not that which God woorketh in vs. But lett vs rather labour and trauell to ſaue our ſelues with litle, ſith that it ſometimes happeneth that a man being skilfull in ſwimming, and will imprudently ſeeke to helpe an other that is in perlll of drowning in the water, they both are drowned, and ſo the loſſe is double.
                  A man ſhalbe obliged to yeld an account of the graces which he hath not: For as God createth a creature by his bounty and grace, he ought reciprocally appeare gracious and acknowledge the ſame; if not, lett him know that he hath loſt grace by his owne negligence. For if he would trauell and labour in the grace receaued, he ſhould obtaine many other graces of God, which through his owne fault, he hath not.
                  I deſire, ſayd this holy Father, firſt to obey euen to death: then

to be humble vnder the feet of each one: thirdly I deſire rigorouſly to chaſtice and rent my fleſh with my teeth, and ſo bind my neck with an iron chaine, as I would haue no power att my pleaſure to gett looſe.
               
               
                  How God wrought many miracles by the merittes of Brother Giles.
                  THE XLII. CHAPTER.
                  OVr Lord by a notable miracle declared how much was the meritt of charity in his ſeruant Brother Giles, who meeting on the way to Aſsiſium a gentleman that was carryed toBy the ſigne of the croſſe he cureth one woū
                        ded. haue a foot cutt off, wherin there was a wound ſo eaten with a cancre, that if the foot were not cutt off, his life were in imminent danger: The gentleman knowing Brother Giles, weeping, made him a pittifull relation of the occaſion of his iorney to Aſsiſium, then opened his legge, and ſhewed him the wound, and with great humility and deuotion prayed him to make the ſigne of the croſſe theron: Br. Giles therby moued with pittie and compaſsion, made the ſigne of the croſſe on the wound, then with great deuotion kiſſed it, and the gentleman was a litle after entierly cured and retourned to his houſe a foot, prayſing and thancking God for ſuch a grace, obtayned by the meritt of his holy ſeruant.
                  This good Father one time reprehended a Religious for a fault committed; and he tooke this reprehenſion ſiniſterly and with litle patience, but the night following there appeared vnto him one that ſayd: Brother henceforward receaue with patience and in good parr the aduertiſmentsDiuine aduertiſment for receiuing reprehiſions. and reprehenſions which ſhalbe giuen you: for he that ſhall beleeue and obey Br. Giles, ſhalbe happy. The Religious incontinently after this viſion aroſe before it was day, and came to the holy Father, acknowledging his fault of impatience vſed vnto him, and moſt humbly beſought him to correct him often, promiſing thenceforwaad to take whatſoeuer ſhould come from him, not only with patience, but with great ioy.
                  A Religious that had neuer ſeene Br. Giles, but had heard ſuch report of him, deſired to ſee both him, and ſome of his actions. But being exceedingly grieued that the great diſtance betweene them, put him in diſpaire of euer receiuing that happines, he one night ſaw in a viſion a booke, wherin no other thing was written but theſe wordes: This is he that prayeth continually for all the people, and for2. Mach. vlt. the holy. Cittie: which the ſayd Religious vnderſtood to be Brother Giles.
                  
                     
A woman of the citty of Peruſia, hauing no milke wherwith to ſuck her litle child, had recourſe to this holie Father, to whome ſhe was much deuoted: but he being in extaſie, ſhe could not ſpeake vnto him. And ſhe not hauing leaſure to expect, came neere him where he prayed, whoſe breaſt hauing with exceeding faith and deuotion, touched, ſhe had milke ſufficient to nource her child.
               
               
                  How God communicated to Br. Giles a moſt pleaſing ſeeling of glory before this death.
                  THE XLIII. CHAPTER.
                  THis holy Father a litle before his death, retourning from prayer into his cell repleniſhed with a merueillous ioy, ſayd to his companion: My child, giue me thy iudgement in this: I haue found a treaſure of ſuch worth and excellency as no humane tongue can expreſſe; and therfore my child, I pray thee againe ſpeake thine opinion therof. Which he diuers times repeated with an exceeding feruour of ſpiritt, and with ſuch enflamed charity, that he ſeemed to be really druncken with the wine of the loue of God, and the abondance of his grace. But this Religious hauing told him that it was time to goe take his refection, he ioyfully anſweared him: My child, this is a ſinguler refection and farre better then any other. The Religious thincking to tempt him ſayd: Father, lett vs not now thinck of theſe thinges, but lett vs to goe to dinner. Wherto the venerable Br. Giles replyed that ſuch ſpeech was iniurious vnto him, and that he ſhould haue done him greater pleaſure to haue ſtricken and wounded him to the bloud. Now one may piously preſume that this holy ſoule had notice that it ſhould ſhortly leaue the fleſh, to enioy that notable treaſure of eternall glory which it ſo much deſired, there to haue fruition and taſt of the moſt ſacred preſence of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST. About that time a Religious told him, that the holy Father S. Francis had ſayd, that the ſeruant of God ſhould alwayes deſire to end his life by martyrdome, wherto he anſweared. For my part I reſpect not to die better then in contemplation.
               
               
                  
                  Of the admirable propheſic he made of himſelfe, and of his death.
                  THE XLIV. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Giles, beſides his age being waſted by grieuous inſrmities, as ache in his head and ſtomache, by a very troubleſome cough, and burning ague, ſo that he could neither eat, sleep, nor repoſe: The Cittizens of Peruſia out of great deuotion towardes him, ſent many armed men to guard him: that being dead, his body might not be buryed other where: well knowing that he did not only deſire, but would order to be buryed att our Lady of Angels. Vnderſtanding then that he was guarded with armed men, with great ſeruour of ſpiritt he vttered theſe wordes: Brethren, tell the Peruſians that the belles ſhal neuer ring for my canonization nor for any miracle of mine, and that they ſhall haue no other ſigne, but that of the Prophet lonas. Which the Peruſians vnderſtanding, they anſweared they would haue him in their cittie, though he ſhould not be canonized: and ſo the eue of ſainct George att the houre of Mattins, as ſoone as the Religious had layed him on a bed to repoſe, hauing receaued the holy ſacramentes ordayned by the Church, without any acke of his body, that might diſcouer and make appeare the agony of his death, only ſhutting his mouth and eyes, this contemplatiue ſoule was diſſolued from the body, with great repoſe, God hauing for all eternity eleuated it vnto his glory. This holy Father departed this life the yeare of grace 1260. and of his conuerſion to Religion 52. haning merited to aſcend vnto heauen their to raigne eternally, the ſame day that he receaued the habitt of the holy Father ſainct Francis, becomming his true follower and diſciple. The Peruſians after death ſeeking ſtones to make him a tombe, found a ſepulchre of marble, wherin was carued the hiſtory of the Prophett Ionas, where they layd his body, according as he had propheſied.
               
               
                  Of the reuelation of the glory of this S.
                  THE XLV. CHAPTER.
                  A Perſon of notable ſanctity ſaw in viſion the holy Br. Giles accō
                     payned with a great number of ſoules of Religious &amp; others that then were dead, and comming out of Purgatory they with him aſcēded into heauē. He ſaw our lord IESVS CHRIST with a great multitude of Angels that came to receaue him with muſicke exquiſitely

melodious made by thoſe Angelicall quiers: theſe bleſſed ſoules were with great honour entertayned of our Redeemer into his kingdome, were he ſeated them on a ſeat of merueillous glory. Att the ſame time that Br. Giles was ſicke of his laſt ſicknes, an other Religious fell alſo ſick euen to death, who was inſtantly prayed by a third Religious his Friend, that if it ſhould pleaſe God to call him, he would reueale vnto him his eſtate, if the diuine Maieſty would permitt it: which the ſick Religious promiſed. Wherfore he dying the ſame day that Br. Giles did, appeared to this his Religious friend, and thus ſpake vnto him: Br. giue thanckes vnto God for that it hath pleaſed him to graunt and giue me his glory, deliuering me with many other ſoules from the paines of Purgatory by the merittes of Saint Giles. Which ſayd he vaniſhed. This Religious not daring to reueale this apparition to any, fell grieuouſly ſick: But conceauing that this ſicknes might be ſent him for not diuulging the glory of Br. Giles, he inſtantly called into his Couent ſome Frere Minors, to whome and to many other Religious he recounted the foreſaid apparition, and was with all miraculouſly recouered.
                  
                     Notable prerogatiues of Br. Giles. S. Bonauenture ſaid of this holy Br. Giles, that God had giuen him one ſpeciall grace, which was, that whoſoeuer did inuocate him in matters concerning the ſaluation of their ſoules, were heard. Our lord wrought many miracles after his death, by his merittes and interceſsion. He cured three perſonnes of infirmities in their eyes, fiue that were lame, and two of paine in their feet, that hindred them from mouing: three of the ſqinancie, a woman in trauell of child: two of agues, one of the ſtone, and many of diuers other diſeaſes.

               THE EIGHTH BOOKE OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE FRIER MINORS.
               WHERIN IS DESCRIBED THE LIFE OF the glorious Virgin S. Clare, the inſtitution of her rule, the conuerſion of S. Agnes her ſiſter, and of an other S. Agnes, daughter to the king of Behomia.
               
                  Of the intention of our Lord in the vocation of S. Clare, and of her contry, her father and mother. Of a reuelation vnto her mother touching her ſanctity, and of her birth.
                  THE FIRST CHAPTER.
                  
                     SIX yeares after the conuerſion of the holy Father S. Francis, and the fourth yeare after the confirmation of his rule by Pope Innocent the third, the yeare of grace 1212. the omnipotent Father of light, hauing framed and ſent into the world a new man, his ſeruant S. Francis, by him to reforme his faithfull in this ſixt age, would alſo that a valerous woman ſhould by his worck appeare in the world to accompany that his great ſeruant, to the end that of thoſe two, ſhould be new borne a perfect regeneration of the children of God. And as the firſt naturall generation came of man and woman, as of an vnited beginning: ſo this ſpirituall generatiō of the imitators of the life and counſailes of IESVS CHRIST, proceeded, in all the Church, and in all the eſtates and qualities of perſonnes, of one ſame ſpiritt of zeale, of perfection, of humility, and of powerty, from one man and one woman. And to the end it might not be vnlike the creation, almighty God hauing firſt perfected his ſeruant

S. Francis, would frame of the ribbe or ſide of his life, doctrine and ſanctity, the glorious Virgin S. Clare, his true and litigimate daughter in IESVS CHRIST for his companion, as zealous alſo of perfection and Angelicall reformation. With great reaſon therfore hath ſhe her place in the Chronicles of the Frere Minors. For ſhe being a ribbe and partye of the ſame Order, it is very requiſite a ſpecial mention ſhould be made of her ſanctity of life, as we ſhall here performe. And if it be not according to her meritt, ſhall att leaſt be done with the leaſt defect we can poſsible, being reſolued to employ therin that litle force of ſpiritt which God hath giuen vs, and this to the honour of his diuine maieſty, of his holy ſeruant, and to the edification of ſoules.
                  
                     The coū
                        try of S. Clare. The glorious ſaincte Clare was borne in the citty of Aſsiſium, ſcituat in the prouince of the Vally of Spoletum, which is a territory appertayning to the Romane Church. Her Father and Mother were noble, of a famous and very weathy famility: her mother was called Hortolana (which in our tongue may be termed Gardener) and not without myſtery, conſidering ſhe was to produce ſo noble and vertuous a plant in the garden of the holy Church. This woman was exceeding deuout and compleate in the fruites of good worckes, and albeit ſhe were maryed, and conſequently obliged to the care and gouernment of her houſe and family, yet did ſhe not omitt, with all her power to be exerciſed in the ſeruice of God, and employed in worckes of mercy.The mother of S. Clare viſited the holy land. She was ſo feruent in the loue of IESVS CHRIST, that with great deuotion ſhe paſſed the ſea with many other Pilgrimes, and viſited thoſe holy places which our Redemer IESVS CHRIST God and man had cō
                     ſecrated with his holy preſence, and retourned exceedingly cōforted and enriched with many merittes. She alſo viſited the Church of Th'archangell S. Michael on the mount Gargan, and with a pious and feruent deſire viſited the Apoſtles S. Peter &amp; S. Paule in Rome: in ſuch ſort did that vertue and feruour in thoſe dayes ſhine, in many holy perſonnes, but now ſo weakened is the feruour of Chriſtians touching viſiting holy places, and the reliques of our Lord and his SS. that it is almoſt loſt, by the continuall warres of heretikes and of our ſinnes. Now our lord began to poore out the abondance of his celeſtiall giftes on the root, that afterwardes the ſproutes of greater ſanctity might follow and diſpearſe into bowes. Neither would he that this deuout woman Hortolana ſhould be depriued of the conſolations and knowledge of this grace: for being neere her childbirth, ſhe one day with great feruour prayed in a Church, and before a Crucifix, where ſhe beſought almighty God to deliuer her from the danger of death in her childbirth which ſhe much apprehended; and ſhe heard a voice that ſayd: Woman, feare not, For thou

ſhalt ſafely and without danger bring forth a light that ſhall illuminate and lighten all the world. Being thus comforted and admoniſhed by this diuine anſweare; ſo ſoone as ſhe was deliuered of a daughter, ſhe cauſed her to be called in Baptiſme, Clare, firmly beleeuing that in her ſhould be accompliſhed the ſplendour of the light promiſed, according to the prouidence and ordonnance of the diuine bounty.
               
               
                  Of the education, charity, prayer, mortification and virginity of ſaincte Clare.
                  THE II. CHAPTER.
                  SAinte Clare being borne into the world, ſhe began incontinently to appeare and to ſhine as a morning ſtarre in the obſcure night of the world, for in the moſt tender yeares of her firſt infancie ſhe alredy diſcouered euident ſignes of notable and pious worckes, wherin ſhe made appeare her naturall worth, and the graces which God had communicated vnto her: for being naturally of a very delicate conſtitution, he receaued of her mother the firſt foundations of faith: afterwardes being inſpired of God, to apply her ſelfe to vertuous and pious worckes, ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe to be a veſſell aptly prepared for diuine grace: and as ſhe abounded in interiour piety, as wel by nature as by grace, towardes poore beggers, ſo according to the ſmall meanes which thē ſhe had, ſhe ſupplyed their neceſsityes. And to the end her ſacrifice might be more gratefull vnto God, the moſt delicate meates that were giuen her, for the nouriſhment of her litle body, ſhe hid, and gaue it ſecretly to the poore. Thus did piety augment and encreaſe in her, and nouriſhed charity in her ſoule, preparing her to receaue the grace and mercy of almighty God. Her greateſt contentment was in prayer, wherby ſhe was often ſuſtayned, made ioyfull, and comforted as by an Angelicall milke, and in a moſt delicious manner eleuated to the diuine pleaſures of the conuerſation of our lord IESVS CHRIST. In theſe beginninges, hauing no beades, ſhe vſed in ſteed therof certaine litle ſtones, ſome to ſerue for the Pater noſter, and others for the Aues, and ſo ſheThe first beades of S. Clare. offred her prayers to God. Whervpon beginning to feele the firſt feruours of diuine loue, ſhe iudged that ſhe muſt contemne all tranſitory apparence and painted flowers of this world: and being by prayer well enſtructed of the holy Ghoſt, ſhe reſolued as a wiſe ſpirituall merchand to haue no more regard of terreſtriall affaires, acknowledging them vnworthy to be eſteemed: and with this Spiritt ſhe did weare as an other ſaincte Cecilie, vnder her gay apparell, a hair-cloth, ſo exteriourly ſatisfying the world, and interiourly her Lord IESVS CHRIST.
                  
                     
But hauing attayned the age of mariage, ſhe was importuned by her Father and other kinred, to chooſe a husband. Wherto ſhe would neuer conſent, but vſed lingringes and delayes, putting off and differring what ſhe could, all humane mariage, and euer recommended to our Lord IESVS CHRIST her virginity, with the other vertues whe
                        •
                      with ſhe was endued, by ſuch exerciſes endeauouring to pleaſe almighty God, that he might beſtow on her his only Sonne for her Spouſe. Such were the firſt fruites of her ſpiritt, and ſuch the exerciſes of her piety, ſo that being anoynted with ſuch a ſweet and ſpirituall oyntment, ſhe yelded a moſt pleaſing ſauour, as ſhoppe repleniſhed with moſt delightfull liquors, whoſe ſauours though they be ſhutt vp, diſcouer and manifeſt themſelues. In ſuch ſort that this holy virgin began, without her knowledge to be commended by her neighbours, the true ſame of her ſecrett pious worckes ſo publiſhing themſelues, that in an inſtant they were exceedingly ſpred abroad, and euery where diuulged.
               
               
                  How the virgin S. Clare had knowledge of the vertues of the holy Father S. Francis.
                  THE III. CHAPTER.
                  THis vertuous virgin Clare hearing the grat ſame of the admirable life of S. Francis, that then renewed vnto the world the way of perfection in the ſame citty, with a merueillous example of piety and vertue, and conſidering that many gentlemen did follow him, and that his life was already approued by our holy mother the Church, ſhe exceedingly deſired to ſee and heare this worthy ſeruant of God, therunto inſpired by the ſoueraigne Father of ſpirittes, to whome had already bin preſented the firſt fruites of their deuotions, though differently. S. Francis hauing bin aduertiſed of this her deſire, and hauing heard the bruit of her vertues and holy affections, deſired alſo exceedingly to ſee her, and to conferre with her, with intention to fruſtrate the world of ſo noble and precious a pray, to preſent her vnto our ſoueraigne Redeemer, to ſerue him in ſome notable enterpriſe, as preordayned of God to deſpoyle the great prince of the world. Neither did his diuine Maieſty faile, to open vnto them the meanes: and to at taine therunto, he inſpired this vertuous woman to relye on a very honorable graue woman, that gouerned her in her houſe as her mother. And to the end this holy purpoſe might be ſiniſterly enterpreted of men, and to hinder publicke murmure, ſhe went out of her Fathers houſe with this good womau, and found out the holy Father, by the feruour

of whoſe pious diſcourſes, ſhe was preſently enflamed with diuine loue, and moued by his holy actions which ſhe admired, as ſeeming vnto her more then humane. And therfore ſhe began very exquiſitely to diſpoſe her ſelfe to the effecting of the wordes of the holy ſeruant of God, who hauing very louingly entertayned her, began to preach vnto her the contempt of the world, and by euident reaſons to demonſtrate vnto her, that all the beauty of thinges preſent is but a vanity, filled with falſe and deceipt full hopes. Then he perſuaded vnto her pure eares, the honourable and amiable eſpouſale of IESVS CHRIST, and counſayled her to conſerue that moſt precious pearles of virginall purity, for that glorious Spouſe, who out of loue he bare to the world being God became man and would be borne of a virgin. This holy Father ſollicited this affaire and playd the procuratour as a Paranimph and Embaſſadour of the heauenly king. The holy virgin on her ſide beginning already to taſt the ſweetnes of contemplation, and the proofe of the eternal ioyes, the world began to ſeeme vnto her vile and contemptible as indeed it is, ſhe as it were melting for the loue of her celeſtiall Spouſe, whome ſhe already deſired with all her hart. Thencefoorth therfore ſhe deſpriſed precious ſtones, iewels, gold, ſumptuous apparell, and all other worldly traſh as filth and donge, and abhorring the deteſtable delightes of the fleſh, ſhe reſolued intierly to dedicate her ſelfe a liuely temple to IESVS CHRIST, and to take him for the only Spouſe of her body and ſoule: and ſo ſubmitting her ſelfe totally to the counſailes of the glorious Father S. Francis, him, next after our Lord, ſhe tooke for guid and directour of her life.
               
               
                  How S. Francis drew the virgin S. Clare out of the world, and made her Religious.
                  THE IV. CHAPTER.
                  ANd to the end the moſt cleare Mirrour of her ſoule might not be ſtayned and blemiſhed with the duſt of this world, and that the contagious ſeculer life did not corrupt her innocencie, the holy Father prudētly endeauoured to ſequeſter this virgin from worldly people. And the ſolemnity of palme-ſunday approching, the holy eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST, wit a great feruour of ſpiritt repayred to this man of God, and moſt inſtantly demaunded of him, when, and how ſhe ſhould make her retyre from the world. Whervpon the holy Father S. Francis ordayned, that one the day of the ſayd feaſt ſhe ſhould goe to the proceſsion of palmes with the people, decked and adorned the moſt richly and gorgiously that ſhe could procure, and the night

following goeing out of the citty and withall out of all conuerſation of the world, ſhe ſhould change ſeculer pleaſures into lamentations of the paſſion of our Lord.
                  Palme-ſunday being come, the glorious S. Clare went in the cōpany of her mother and other ladies to the great Church, where there happened a matter worthy to be recorded, as not done without the prouidē
                     ce of the diuine goodnes. Which was, that all the other ladyes goeing, as is the cuſtome of Italie, to take holy palme, and S. Clare, out of a virginall baſhfulnes, remayning alone without mouing out of her place, the Biſhop deſcended the ſteppes of his ſeat, and putt into her hand a branch of palme.
                  The night approching ſhe began to prepare her ſelfe for effecting the commandement of the holy Father, and to make a glorious flight and honorable retyre frō the world, in honeſt company. But it ſeeming to to her impoſsible to goe foorth att the ordinary and chieffeſt dore of the houſe, ſhe bethought her ſelfe to take the benefitt of a back dore, which (though it were damned vp with groſſe ſtones and mighty blockes) ſhe with an admirable courage, &amp; a force rather of a ſtrong man then a tēder yong woman, her ſelfe brake open. Thus then leauing her fathers houſe, her citty, kinred and friendes, ſhe with extraordinary ſpeed arriued att the Church of our lady of Angels, where the Religious that in the houſe of God, were employed in pious watchinges, receaued with burning wax lightes in their handes, this holy virgin, that ſought her Spouſe and Redeemer IESVS CHRIST with a lampe not extinct and empty, but filled with diuine loue. And incontinently in the ſelfe ſame hour and place, hauing left and abandonned the immondicities of Babilō, ſhe gaue the world the ticket of defiance and repudiation before the altar of the ſoueraine Queene of Angels, where the glorious Father ſainct Francis, inſpired of God, and neglecting all other worldly reſpect, cutt off her haire: then he cloathed her with a poore habitt of the Order, reiecting the iewels and gorgious attire which ſhe brought, to be giuen to the poore of IESVS CHRIST. It had not bin in deed conuenient that the new Order of floriſhing virginity towardes the end of the world, ſhould otherwhere begin then in the Angelicall Pallace of that moſt emminent lady, who before had alone bin a mother and Virgin, and conſequently more worthy then all others. In the very ſame place had the noble cheualrie of the poore of IESVS CHRIST, the Frere Minors, their beginning vnder the valerous Captaine ſainct Francis: to the end it might euidently appeare that the mother of God in this her habitation ingendred and produced the one and the other Religion. And ſo, as this new eſpouſe had raceaued the habitt and enſignes of holy penitence before the altar of the moſt ſacred virgin Mary, the

humble ſeruante was accepted by IESVS CHRIST for his eſpouſe, and the glorious Father ſainct Francis conducted her to the Monaſtery of ſainct Paul in Aſsiſium, where were Religious women of the Order of S. Bennet, there to remayne till almighty God prouided an other Monaſtery.
               
               
                  How much the kinred of S. Clare laboured to retire her from Religion, and how she was conducted to S. Damian.
                  THE V. CHAPTER.
                  THe kinred of this holy virgin vnderſtanding what ſhe had done, and the bruit of her reſolution being diuulged ouer all the citty, many of the kinred and friendes of her Father and mother aſſembled and conſulted, to preuent this vertuous virgin of her holy reſolution: and comming to the monaſtery of the Religious of ſainct Bennet, whither ſhe was retyred, they purpoſed to execute by violence what they could not compaſſe by humane reaſons, trying their forces againſt that meeke lambe of IESVS CHRIST, and by their malice and peruerſe counſaile, ſeeking to delude that ſimple doue: then did they make her deceitfull promiſes, exhorting her to retyre her ſelfe from ſuch baſe condition and abiection, demonſtrating vnto her that it was a matter vnworthy her noble diſcent, and that neuer the like happened in the citty. But the virgin firme and ſtable in IESVS CHRIST, approaching to the Altar, diſcouered her haireleſſe head, alleadging that ſhe could no more be ſeparated from the ſeruice of IESVS CHRIST, for whoſe loue ſhe had already forſaken all the world and themſelues alſo; and the more they tormented her, the more was her hart enflamed in the loue of IESVS CHRIST, he ſupplying her with new forces to reſiſt. Thus for many dayes together diſturbed with many iniuryes, ſhe endured great contradictions in the way of God: and albeit her kinred perſeuered in their attemptes to withdraw her from her pious deſigne, her feruour yett did neuer wax cold, nor her hart feeble: but on the contrary, ſo many iniurious wordes and violent threates did ſo confirme her confidence in God, that her kinred were conſtrayned to forbeare any more to vexe and diſquiett her, retyring themſelues as all aſhamed and confounded. Thus did almighty God make appeare, how much the power of thoſe that are his, though of themſelues feeble, did exceed the ſtrong and puiſſant of the world.
                  But in regard that her ſoule had not perfect repoſe in that place, ſhe was by the holy Father ſainct Francis placed in the Church of ſainct

Damian, &amp; there as in ſecure harbour, ſhe caſt the anchor of her ſoule, without euer chaunging place, neither in reſpect of the great reſtraint therof, nor for feare of ſolitude, this church being without the citty. This was the Church in reparation wherof the glorious Father S. Francis laboured in the beginning of his conuerſion: and where alſo he offered mony to the Chappelaine to repaire it: this holy Father being alſo in this church and praying with abondance of teares, merited to heare the voice of the crucifix, before which he was, that thriſe reiterated vnto him: Goe Francis and repaire my houſe, which as thou ſeeſt is ready to fall. The glorious virgin Clare for the loue of her heauenly Spouſe, ſhutt her ſelfe vp in that litle place, and there impriſonned her ſelfe, during her life ſequeſtring her body from the turbulent tempeſt of the world. This ſiluered doue there building her neſt in the concauities of that church, engendred the colledge of Virgins of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, there inſtitued a holy Couent, and gaue a beginning to the Order of poore Religious women, and thus being ſetled in the way of penance, ſhe battered the hard turfes of her members, with the coulter of the croſſe, and perfectly ſowed the ſeed of ſanctity and iuſtice, making with her very ſoule ſteppes and traces of vertuoue progreſſe for thē that were to follow her.
               
               
                  How the Virgin Agnes, ſister to S. Clare, was by her feruent prayes conuerted, and of the perſecutions she endured by her kinred, and how she was miraculously freed of them.
                  THE VI. CHAPTER.
                  SAincte Clare had a yonger ſiſter, who both in regard of bloud and of pouerty was really her ſiſter, ſhe exceedingly deſiring the conuerſion of this yong virgin, neuer failed in her moſt feruent deuotions, which in her firſt dayes ſhe offered to almighty God, the moſt deuoutly ſhe poſsibly could with a perfect affection, to beſeech him, that as ſhe had liued with her ſiſter in the world, there might be alſo betweene them a vnion of body and will in his ſeruice, moſt inſtantly Importuning him to make appeare to her ſiſter whome ſhe had left in her mothers houſe, what a notorious deluder the world is, and how full of diſcontentment: and on the contrary how ſweet and contentfull is IESVS CHRIST, and that conſequently he would pleaſe to change her deſired reſolution of carnall marriage, and cauſe her to embrace the vniō of diuine loue, and to take for Spouſe the king of glory. Now in regard that our lord had already ſetled ſuch an amity betweene theſe twoo ſiſters, that their ſeparation was afflictiue and troubleſome vnto

them (though then their deſires and willes were farre different) he made no delay to fauour this his deuout ſuppliant, euen in this firſt petition, which ſhe ſo inſtantly required of him, and which his diuine Maieſty ſo readily granted. Sixteene dayes then after her conuerſion, her ſiſter Agnes inſpired of God, with a ſtrong and prompt reſolution gaue a ſlipp and farwell to the world, and came to her ſiſter Clare, to whome diſcouering the ſecrett of her hart, ſhe ſayd, ſhe was reſolued to ſerue God in her company. Which the glorious Clare vnderſtanding, ſhe moſt amiably embraced her, and with a very ioyfull and contented countenance ſayd: My moſt deere ſiſter, I giue infinite thanckes to our lorde IESVS CHRIST, that it hath pleaſed him to heare me, and deliuer me from the affliction I endured for your ſake. This noble conuerſion of Agnes by the prayers of her Siſter Clare, was ſeconded by as many contradictions of her kinred: for theſe bleſſed ſiſters ſeruing our lord IESVS CHRIST and imitating his ſteppes, ſhe that had moſt taſt of God and was in highher progreſſe, inſtructing her ſiſter Nouice: their kinred knowing that Agnes was with her ſiſter Clare, twelue men of their neereſt bloud, as Brothers, Vncles, and Coſen germanes, aſſembled to aſſault them and to combat the eſpouſes IESVS CHRIST. The day following then, with an extreme rage and fury they came to theſe holy virgins, yett att their firſt comming, diſſembling their lewd intenſion, they ſhewed them ſome fauourable countenance: then addreſsing them ſelues to the virgin Agnes, diſpairing of all opinion to withdraw S. Clare from her holy purpoſe, they demaunded of her wherfore the was retyred into that place; then willed her to deliberate and reſolue to retourne with them to her fathers houſe. Wherto ſhe anſweared, that ſhe was reſolued, the grace of God aſsiſting her, to remayne with her ſiſter: which anſweare one among them diſdayning, full of paſsion and tranſported with choler, tooke her by the haire, and gaue her many blowes with his feet and ſiſtes, then vſed all his force to pull her out of the place, which att length by the helpe of the others he performed: for taking her in their armes, they forcibly trayled her out. But this litle daughter of IESVS CHRIST, ſeeing her ſelfe violently wreſted by thoſe furious lions out of the armes of her God, ſhe began to cry to her ſiſter, help me ſiſter, and permitt me not to be ſeparated from our Lord IESVS CHRIST and your louing company. Her carnall kinred trayned a long the vally this virgin of IESVS CHRIST againſt her will, and in deſpight of her feeble, though couragious reſiſtance, renting her cloathes from her tender body. In meane while ſainte Clare vnable by other meanes to relieue her ſiſter, had recourſe to prayer, with abondance of teares beſeeching God to voutſafe to giue a couragious confidence to her ſiſter, that his diuine fauour defending

his faithfull ſeruant, humane forces might be ouercome, and our lord heard her: for att the inſtant of her prayer, the body of the virgin Agnes, miraculously became ſo weighty, that her kinred were att lenght enforced to leaue her one the ground. And albeit ſo many men and their ſeruantes putt all their forces to lift her vp, yet could they neuer doe it, but called labourers &amp; worckmen of the vineyards that wrought therabout to aſsiſt them, yet their great nomber no more auayled then the leſſer. Finally the forces failing of her kinred and thoſe that attempted to aſsiſt them: they acknowledged the miracle, though ſcornefully, ſaying: It is no meruaile that ſhe is ſo weighty ſhe hauing bin all night, as lead, whervpon Signeur Monalde her vncle in extreme paſsion, lifting vp his arme to ſtrike her he preſently felt an extreme paine therin, which did not only torment him for the preſent, but a long time after. Herevpon S. Clare (after her prayer) arriuing, beſought her kinred to forbeare in vaine to contend with God, and to leaue vnto her the care of her ſiſter, who lay as halfe dead. They perceauing that they would neuer ſtagger in their pious reſolution, being exceedingly wearyed, left the two ſiſters together. This troup then being departed, the tormented Agnes aroſe from the ground full of ioy in IESVS CHRIST, for whoſe loue ſhe had fought and ouercome in this her firſt conflict, againſt the world and his Prince the deuill, by fauour and aſsiſtance of diuine grace; and her ſiſter asking her how ſhe felt her ſelfe, ſhe anſweared, that notwithſtanding all the affliction they had procured her, by buffettes, beatinges, ſpurnes with their feet and fiſtes, tearing by the haire, trayning her through ſtony wayes, ſhe had felt in manner nothing, eſpecially by the vertue and force of diuine grace, and next by the merittes of her good prayers. Shortly after the holy Father ſainct Francis cutt off her haire, leauing her ſtil hir proper name, Agnes, in memory of the innocent lambe IESVS CHRIST, who offering himſelfe in ſacrifice to his Father, gaue reſiſtance to the world, fought valerously and ouercame. And ſo the holy Father inſtructed her with her ſiſter, and taught her the way of God, in ſuch ſort that ſhe ſo encreaſed and profited in Religion, in vertue and ſanctity, that ſhe was an admiration to all the world.
               
               
                  Of the humility of the Virgin ſaincte Clare.
                  THE VII. CHAPTER.
                  PRofound humility was the firſt aſſured ſtone and foundation which the holy Virgin layd in the beginning of her Religion, after ſhe

had began to labour in the way of God, ſo to aduance and ſett forward the building of all other vertues. She vowed obedience vnto ſainct Francis, which vow in all her life ſhe neuer tranſgreſſed; and for three yeares after her conuerſion ſhe deſired rather, with great humility to be ſubiect, then a ſuperiour ſhunning the title and office of Abbeſſe, taking more content to ſerue among the ſeruantes of IESVS CHRIST, them to be ſerued. But being att lenght by the holy Father ſainct Francis thervnto conſtrayned, ſhe vndertooke the gouernement of the Religious, which bred in her hart more feare then preſumption, ſo that ſhe rather continued and became a ſeruant, then free from ſubiection. For the more ſhe ſeemed to be rayſed to the office and title of dignity, the more did ſhe repute and eſteeme her ſelfe vile, and the more ſhewed her ſelfe ready to ſerue, and made her ſelfe more contemptible then all her Religious, both in habitt and baſe ſeruice. She diſdained not to doe the office of ſeruantes, giuing water to the Religious to waſh, whome ſhe made often to ſitt, her ſelfe ſtanding and ſeruing them att table. When ſhe commanded any thing, it was vnwillingly, rather deſiring to doe, then to command others. She performed to the ſicke all kind of ſeruices, were they neuer ſo loathſome, as to make cleane the immondicities and filthines, ſhunning with ſo worthy a ſpiritt, the loathſome actions, nor abhorring or diſdaining the moſt offenſi
                        •
                     e ſauours. She often waſhed the feet of the lay ſiſters, when they came from abroad, made them cleane, and with great humility kiſſed them. It one time chaunced, that waſhing the feet of a ſeruant, and offering to kiſſe them, the ſeruant vnwilling to permitt ſuch humility, pulled away her foot to auoyd it, but ſhe did it ſo rudely, that ſhe gaue the holy virgin a daſh on the face. Yet ſo farre was this Sainct from being offended therwith, that on the contrary ſhe mildly tooke the foot of the ſeruant againe, and kiſſed the ſole therof. Thus did this true eſpouſe of God accompliſh the doctrine of IESVS CHRIST, andIoa. the example which he left when he waſhed the feet of his Apoſtles.
               
               
                  Of the voluntary pouerty of the Virgin ſaincte Clare, and of her zeale to that holy vertue.
                  THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                  THis holy virgin made a vnion and correſpondence betweene her pouertye in all externall thinges and her holy pouerty of ſpiritt,

and firſt att the beginning of her conuerſion ſhe made ſale of her patrimony and birth right, al which diſtributing vnto the poore of IESVS CHRIST, ſhe reſerued nothing to her ſelfe. Hauing ſo abandoned all the world exteriourly, and enriched her ſoule interiourly, freed of the burden of worldly affaires, ſhe ran farre more lightly after IESVS CHRIST, and thetby contracted ſuch an inuiolable amity with holy pouerty, that ſhe would haue poſſeſsion of no other thing then the glorious IESVS CHRIST, nor would ſhe permitt her ſpirituall daughters to poſſeſſe any thinge elſe. And with this Euangelicall trafique, ſhe purchacedHe is too couetous whome God doth not ſuffice. the moſt precious pearle of celeſtiall deſire, in place of all the other thinges which ſhe had ſold, acknowledging that the ſame could in no ſort be enioyed together with the diſtraction and occupation of temporall thinges. Giuing inſtructions to her Religious, ſhe would ſomtimes ſay vnto them, that this their company ſhould be then gratefull to God, ſhould become very rich in pouerty, and ſhould by ſuch meane conſerue it ſelfe firme and ſtable, if it were alwayes fortified and enuironed withe the rampiers and ſtrong bulwarckes of pouerty. She alſo admoniſhed her beloued daughters in our Lord IESVS CHRIST, to conforme themſelues to him lying poore in the bed of pouerty, who was no ſooner borne, but was by the moſt ſacred virgin his mother layd in the narrow cribbe.
                  Now deſiring to entitle her rule by the title of pouerty, ſhe demaunded of Pope Innocent the fourth the priuiledge of pouerty, who as a a Magnanimous Prelat reioycing att the great feruour of this holy virgin, exceedingly commended this her deuotion, aſſuring himſelfe that the like priuiledge had neuer bin demaunded of the Apoſtolike ſea. And to the end a new and extraordinary fauour might anſweare this new and vnaccuſtomed demaund, the holy Pope with an exceeding contentment wrote with his owne hand the firſt pattent of the priuiledge. Which Pope Gregory the ninth his predeceſſour, of holy memory, had alſo done, who with a Fatherly affection louing this eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST, once gaue her counſaile, in conſideration of the diuerſe alterations of matters, and the ſtrange euents of times, yea and in regard of the perills of future ages, to be content that her Order might haue ſome poſſeſsions, himſelfe offering to beſtow it on them: but ſhe couragiouſly withſtood it, and as a true, poore, and legitimate daughter of the Patriarch poore S. Francis, would neuer accord thervnto. The Pope alleadging that if ſhe feared the breach of her vow, he would abſolue her therof. This Virgin very humbly anſweared him in theſe tearmes: Holy Father, I ſhalbe very ioyfull if it pleaſe your holineſſe to abſolue me of all my ſinnes. But to free me from performing the Counſailes of God, I will accept no abſolution. This holy virgin

with an exceeding ioy receaued the morcels of bread which the Religious brought from begging, and had gotten for the loue of God: But ſhe was much troubled when ſhe ſaw whole loaues. She laboured much to conforme her ſelfe in all conditions of perfections of perfect pouerty with him that was poorely crucified: And in ſuch ſort that no tranſitory thing might ſeparate the moſt poore virgin from her beloued, nor hinder her from her moſt ardent feruour to follow our Lord IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  Of the miracles of the pouerty of the glorious S. Clare.
                  THE IX. CHAPTER.
                  
                     With a litle loafe she fed two families. IT happened one day that the glorious virgin S. Clare knew that there was but one only loafe of bread in her Couent, and ſo the houre of dinner being come, ſhe called the deſpenſier, and willed her to cutt the loafe ſhe had in her cuſtodye in two, and to ſend the one halfe to the Religious that were without, and to keepe the other for themſelues, wherof ſhe ſhould make fifty portions, there being ſo many Religious, and then ſhould ſett it on the table of pouerty. Whereto the deſpeſier anſweared that the miracles of IESVS CHRIST were needful to make ſo many portions of ſo ſmall quantity of bread. But S. Clare replyed: Daughter doe only what I command thee: the Religious went preſently to effect the commandement of her Abbeſſe: who in the meane while, together with all the Religious applyed themſelues to prayer, preſenting their deuotions and teares to their Spouſe IESVS CHRIST, and inſtantly by his bounty the litle the morcles of bread ſo augmented in the handes of the deſpenſier that cutt it, that they ſufficied to feed all the Religious.
                  It happened an other time that the ſeruantes of IESVS CHRIST wanted oyle, ſo that they had not ſufficient to dreſſe meat for the ſick: S. Clare being aduertiſed of this neceſsity, tooke a pott, which as miſtres of humility ſhe waſhed with her owne handes, then ſent it to the turne wheele, that a Religious man there might take it to goe demaund oyle for the loue of God. Hauing to this effect cauſed to be called a Religious mā to ſend him (as matters doe not ſucceed as men propoſe, but according to the pleaſure of the diuine and mercifull prouidence) S. Clare hauing recommended this neceſsity to almighty God, the ſaid Religious found the pott full of pure oyle; which perceauing, he thought the Religious within had required it without need; and with a kind of murmure he ſaid: I know not why the ſiſters haue called me, their pott being full of oyle: So the miracle was diſcouered.

Almighty God did often alſo by extraordinary meanes ſupply the neceſsities of his poore ſeruantes, by the meritorious prayers of ſainte Clare.
               
               
                  Of the auſtere mortifications, abstinences and faſt of S. Clare.
                  THE X. CHAPTER.
                  I Doubt whither it be not more expediēt to conceale, then to diuulge the admirable affliction and rude penance of ſainte Clare, becauſe this holy virgin hath performed ſuch extreme mortifications, that many who ſhall read them acknowledging themſelues cowardes &amp; ouercome in this conflict, (as al we are) and putt into admiration att theſe merueillous actes, will perhappes call in queſtion her proweſſes, which is to oppugne the very truth. Is it not a great matter that vſing one only habitt all patched, and a poore cloake of the groſſeſt cloth, ſhe rather couered her body then defended it from the importunities of the ſeaſons? But it is more admirable that ſhe neuer woare ſtockinges, ſhooes, nor other thing on her feet, after ſhe became Religious. It was alſo a ſtrange matter, that ſhe faſted dayly and neuer failed for whatſoeuer occaſion that happened. She neuer lay on mattreſſe, though that were no ſinguler prayſe vnto her, all her Religious doeing the like. This eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST woare more then the reſt a haircloth as great as halfe a tunicle, made of hogges haire, the haire next her flesh being halfe ſhorne: She alſo woare a haire cloth, which a Religious very importunately once borrowed of her: but prouing it to be ſo rude and ſharpe, ſhe reſtored it to ſaincte Clare three dayes after, more readily then ſhe had ioyfully borrowed it. Her ordinary bed was the bareground, except ſometimes ſhe slept on dry branches or twigges, vſing for a pillow a block of wood. But in regard that the rigorous life wherwith ſhe ſo afflicted her body brought her to ſickneſſe, the holy Father ſaint Francis commanded her to lye on chaffe. The rigour of her abſtinence in her faſtes was ſuch, that ſhe could not maintaine her body in life, ſo litle did ſhe eat, but that it is eaſy to iudge ſhe was ſuſtayned by diuine vertue. When ſhe had her health, ſhe faſted all the Aduent and Lent; and from Alſaintes to Chriſtmas with bread and water the ſondayes excepted: and which is more admirable, three dayes of the weeke, munday, wedneſday and friday of the lent, ſhe did eat nothing at all: ſo that the commandement of faſt, and the rigour of her voluntarie mortification ſeemed to haue a contrariety each with other, becauſe the eue of a perfect or commanded faſt, ſhe vſed but bread and water. Neither muſt it be admired if ſuch a rigour of ſo long continuance, bred many

infirmities in this holy virgin, which waſted her forces, and ouerthrew all her naturall ſtrenght and health of body. The deuout Religious daughters of this holy mother, had exceeding compaſsion of her, and very bitterly lamented her voluntarily procuring her owne death. For remedy wherof, ſaint Francis and the biſhop of Aſsiſium forbad her thoſe three dayes of faſt, which euery weeke ſhe cruelly inflicted on her ſelfe, and commanded her not to paſſe one day without taking att leaſt an ownce and a halfe of bread to conſerue her life. And albeitt ſuch grieuous affliction of the body doe accuſtome to breed alſo ſome affliction to the heart, yet did the contrary ſucced in her; for ſhe carryed a countenance ſo gracious and ioyfull in all her auſterities, that ſhe ſeemed, either to haue no feeling of them, or not to feare any inconuenience therof; Yea, ſhe in a ſort ſcoffed att corporall afflictions: which ſufficiently demonſtrated that the ſpirituall ioy wherwith ſhe was interiourly nouriſhed, appeared exteriourly in her holy face, becauſe the true loue of the hart, alwayes maketh corporall afflictions eaſy and light.
               
               
                  Of the deuotion and ſpirituall profitt which the fame of the glorious S. Clare procured ouer all the world.
                  THE XI. CHAPTER.
                  THe fame of ſainte Clare began within litle time to ſpred ouer all Italy, which cauſed women from all partes to begin to runne after the odour of the precious liquour of her fanctity. The virgins after her example approached vnto IESVS CHRIST and made him preſentes of their virginity. Marryed women endeauoured to liue more chaſt and vertuously: Gentlewomen and Ladyes contemning their faire houſes and ſumptuous tables, ſhutt themſelues into Monaſteryes, eſteeming it a great glory to liue in ſtrict penance for the loue of IESVS CHRIST. This Saint was alſo a ſpurre vnto men, to excite in them a violent feruour, and principally to youth, that began to take courage in the contempt of the world, and by example of the frayler ſexe, to fight againſt the temptations and deceiptfull pleaſures of the fleſh; Many marryed perſonnes with mutuall conſent obliged themſelues to continencie, the men entring into Couentes of men, and the women into monaſteryes of Religious women. The mother induced the daughter to ſerue IESVS CHRIST, the daughter the mother, one ſiſter an other, and briefly each one by

a holy enuie deſired to ſerue IESVS CHRIST, all ſeeking to participate of the euangelicall life which by this eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST, was demonſtrated vnto them. An infinite number of virgins that by her fame were induced to piety, vnable to become Religious, or to leaue their Fathers houſes, endeauoured yet to liue therin religiously, leading a reguler life without rule. S. Clare by her example produced ſuch branches of ſaluation, that it ſeemed the ſaying of rhe Prophett was to be accompliſhed in her: The fruites of the deſolate and barren, are far greater then of the maried. Whiles theſe matters thus proceeded in Italy, the diſcent of this benediction, which deſtilled downe in the vally of Spoletum, grew, by diuine prouidence to ſo ſpacious and lardge a floud, that the violent current therof ouer flowed all the citties of the holy Church, ſo that the nouelty of ſuch admirable thinges, was ſpeedily diuulged ouer all the world, and with ſuch praiſe and admiration gaue ſuch luſtre, that the nature of her vertues filled with ſplendour the chambers of great ladyes, and penetrated euen into the great pallaces of Ducheſſes, yea thoſe moſt pure beames of her brightnes pearced into the very cabbinettes of Queenes and Princeſſes, in ſuch ſort that eminencie of bloud and hight of nobility ſubmitted &amp; debaſed it ſelfe to follow the ſteppes of this glorious Virgin, many reiecting the beames of their honour, and the ſublimity of their eſtates, ſo that ſome ladyes that could haue bin marryed to kinges and dukes, induced by the fame of ſaincte Clare, tooke vpon them the practiſe of ſtrict pennance: and many already marryed to men of great nobility, deſired in their eſtate to imitate this ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST. An infinite number alſo of citties were in this example adorned with Monaſteries of yong women: The fieldes, and mountaines were ennobled and enriched with the ſtructures of theſe celeſtiall buildinges. The exerciſe and honour of chaſtity did multiply in the world, ſaincte Clare carrying the ſtanderd of the Order of Virgins, which being almoſt extinguiſhed, ſhe reſtored to perfection reneweing it by the bleſſed flowers of her example and conuerſation. But retourning to the hiſtory, lett vs ſpeake of the perfection of the prayer of this glorious Virgin, by meane wherof ſhe obtayned of God ſo great graces for her ſelfe and her daughters.
               
               
                  Of the feruent and perfect prayer of the Virgin, S. Clare.
                  THE XII. CHAPTER.
                  AS ſaincte Clare was mortified in her fleſh, and far remote from all corporall recreation, ſo did ſhe continually buſye her ſoule in deuotions

and diuine prayſes. This virgin had fixed and imprinted the ſubtility of her feruent deſire in the eternal light: &amp; as ſhe was remote from earthly occupations and rumors, ſo did ſhe the more lardgely dilate the boſome of her ſoule to the influence of diuine grace. She continued in long prayer together with her Religious after compline, the riuers of teares that flowed from her eyes awakening and bathing the hartes of her companions: When the ſleep of others gaue her opportunity to be ſolitary, being often in prayer, ſhe would lay her face againſt the earth bathed with teares, kiſsing it ſweetly and with ſuch contentmenr, that ſhe ſeemed alwayes to hold in her armes her Spouſe IESVS CHRIST, att whoſe feete her teares trickled downe, and her kiſſes left their impreſsions.
                  It happened one time, that as this holy virgin powered out her teares in the ſilent of the night, the Angel of darcknes appeared vnto her in figure of a black yong man, ſaying: If thou continueſt this extreme weeping thou wilt become blind. Wherto ſhe anſweared: He that is to ſee God, cannot be blinde. Wherwith the deuill being confounded vaniſhed and fled. The ſame night this S. being in prayer, after matines, all bathed in teares, the temptor appeared againe vnto her and ſayd: Weep not ſo much, vnleſſe thou wilt haue thy braine to melt and diſtill, in ſuch ſort as thou ſhalt auoyd it att thy eyes and noſtrels, and therwith ſhalt haue thy noſe crooked. S. Clare with great feruour anſweared him: He that ſerueth IESVS CHRIST can haue no crookedneſſe, and preſently the wicked ſpiritt diſappeared. Many ſignes did diſcouer &amp; make knowne the great alteration ſhe receaued in her ſelfe, in the feruour of her prayer, and how ſweet and delectable the diuine bounty was vnto her in this ioy and holy conuerſation: for when ſhe retourned from prayer, ſhe with admirable contentment, brought wordes enflamed with the fire of the altare of God, which kindled the hartes of her Religious, and procured in them a great admiration att this extreme ſweetnes that appeared and flaſhed out of her face. It is without doubt, that almighty God had coupled and conioyned his ſweetnes with her pouerty, and did manifeſt exteriourly in her body, that her ſoule was interiourly repleniſhed with diuine light. In this manner did ſhe ordinarily liue full of ſo ſupreme delightes, paſsing ouer this deceiptfull world with her noble Spouſe IESVS CHRIST, and being on this wheele of motion, ſhe was theron ſuſtayned with an aſſurance and firmity of vertue, very ſtable, and preſerued with the celeſtiall eleuation of her ſoule, in the hight of heauen, keeping the treaſure of glory ſecurely ſhutt vp, with in a veſſell of fleſh, here below on earth. This holy virgin accuſtomed to call vp the yonger Religious a litle before mattines, and to awaken them with the ordinary ſigne, to excite them very often to praiſe

God. All her Religious ſleeping, ſhe did watch, lighted the lampe, &amp; rung att mattines, ſo that negligence found no entrance into her monaſtery: nor sloath had there any place. She alſo, by the ſting of ſharpe repreprehenſion, and of her liuely and effectuall examples, expelled tepedity and irckſomnes in prayer and the ſeruice of God.
               
               
                  How the Mores were expelled the Monaſtery, by the prayers of S. Clare.
                  THE XIII. CHAPTER.
                  THis being the place where we ſhould record the miracles of this holy virgin, it is not conuenient that we pretermitt them in ſilence: for as the merueillous effectes of her prayer are veritable, ſo alſo are they worthy of honour and reuerence. In the time of the Emperour Federick the ſecond, the holy Church in diuers places endured great perſecutions, but particulerly in the vally of Spoletum, which being ſubiect to the Romane Church, dranck of the veſſell of wrath of this miſchieuous tyrant, his capitaines and ſoldiers being ſcattered ouer the fieldes as graſſe hoppers, with ſword to murder people, and with fire to burne their houſes. The impiety of this Emperour did ſo augment, that he had aſſembled all the Mores that dwelt on the mountaines and among the deſertes, to make himſelfe the more fearefull vnto his vaſſels: and after he had by lardge promiſes gayned theſe Mores, and diſpoſed them into diuers places, he gaue them att length for retyre a very ancient but ruined citty, which yet to this preſent is called, Moura des Mores, which they fortifyed, and then thither retyred about twenty thouſand fighting men, who did much miſcheife ouer all Apulia, and in other Chriſtian places. Theſe ennemies of the faith of IESVS CHRIST came one day vnexpectedly towardes the cittye of Aſsiſium, who being already cloſe to the portes, a great number of them came to the Monaſtery of ſaint Damian, as a lewd and diſsloyall nation that continually thirſteth after the bloud of Chriſtians, and dareth to committ indifferently all kind of execrable actes, without either ſhame of men, or feare of God. Theſe Mores then brake euen into the Monaſtery of ſainte Clare, where ſhe was with her Religious daughters, who had their hartes ſurpriſed with an extreme terrour: but much more when they heard the barking and crye of thoſe dogges ſo neere them, ſo that they were euen dying with the apprehenſion, not knowing where to ſeeke reliefe, nor of whome to hope for deliuerance from ſo emminent perill, but by the merittes of their holy mother, Whome with infinite ſighes and teares, they aduertiſed of what they heard and ſaw. This holy virgin (though ſick) encouraging her Religious, cauſed her ſelfe

with incredible conſtancie to be carryed to the gate of her Monaſtery, att the entry wherof in the ſight of all her ennemies, ſhe with very great reuerence placed the moſt bleſſed ſacrament of the Euchariſt, in the pix before which falling poſtrate on the earth, ſhe with abondance of teares thus ſpake to her beloued Spouſe IESVS CHRIST: Is it poſsible my God, thy will ſhould be, that theſe they ſeruantes, who cannot vſe materiall weapons to defend thēſelues, and whome I haue here brought vp &amp; nourced in thy holy loue, ſhould now be deliuered into the power of the Infidell Mores? Oh my God! Preſerue thē if thou pleaſe, and me likewiſe: for albeit thy diuine Maieſty hath cōmitted thē to my gouernemēt, yet is it not in my power to defend thē from ſo great a perill, ſith this protection cānot be but by a worck of thine omnipotencie: Therfore doe I recōmend thē to thy diuine Maieſty, with all the affection that I am able. As ſoone as this holy virgin had ſent theſe prayers vnto heauē, ſhe heard a voice ſo delicate as if it had bin of a ſucking child, that ſaid: I will protect you for eue
                        •
                     : The holy mother did not yet giue ouer to preſent her prayers, ſaying: My God, I humbly beſeech thee, if ſo it be thy holy will, to preſerue and defend this thy citty of Aſsiſium, which doth nouriſh vs for the loue it beareth to thy diuine Maieſty. Wherto God anſweared: This citty ſhall ſuffer much, but in the end I will by my fauour defend it. Sainte Clare hauing heard ſo gracious newes, lifted vp her face bathed with teares, and comforted her beloued daughters, ſaying. Deere Siſters, I aſſure you that no euill ſhall befall you: only be carefull to haue a firme faith and confidence in IESVS CHRIST. The diuine aſsiſtāce made no long delay: for the preſumption and rage of the Mores was incontinently cooled, ſo that a ſodaine vnknowne terrour hauing ſurpriſed them, they ſpeedily retyred ouer the walles which they had ſcaled and ouer leapt, to enter: They being thus by the vertue of the prayer of ſainte Clare expelled, ſhe priuatly called the Religious that had heard the ſayd voice of God, and commanded them, that howſoeuer it were▪ they ſhould not diuulge what they had heard, during her life.
               
               
                  How the citty of Aſsiſium was an other time deliuered by the prayer of this holy Virgin.
                  THE XIV. CHAPTER.
                  ON an other time, one of the principall Capitaines of the Emperour Federick called Vitall d'Auerſe, a man very ambitious of glory, full of courage and a notable Capitaine, conducted his troupes to beſiege Aſsiſiū, and hauing encōpaſſed it, he expoſed to waſt and ſpoile the plaine contry therabout, making a totall ruine euen to the

very trees which were hewed downe, and then framing his ſiege, he vttered menacing and vaunting oathes, that he would not ſtirre thence, till he had giuen the citty a victorious aſſault: and ſo this ſiege ſo long continued that the beſieged began to looſe courage, as wanting many thinges extreemely needfull vnto them. Wherof this holy ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST being aduertiſed, ſighing in her hart, ſhe called all her Religious, to whome ſhe thus diſcourſed: My deere ſiſters, you know that all our neceſsities haue euer bin ſupplyed by the charity of this citty; ſo that we ſhould proue very vngratefull, if we ſhould not according to our ability aſsiſt them in this extreme neceſsity: then ſhe commanded to be broughte her, aſhes, and all her Religious to diſcoife their heades, and to giue them example ſhe began to couer her bare head with aſhes, wherin all the other Religious following her, ſhe ſaid: Goe ye to our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and with the greateſt humility and moſt feruent prayers that you can poſsible, demaund of him the deliuery of your citty. It cannot be expreſſed with what feruour and teares theſe deuout virgins inceſſantly offerred their prayers and teares vnto God, one entier day and one night, demaunding mercy in behalfe of the ſaid citty beſieged by their ennemies. Theſe prayers and teares were of ſuch force and vertue, that the omnipotent in bounty and mercy had compaſsion of them, and from the day following ſent them his puiſſant aſsiſtance, in ſuch ſort that the ennemies camp was defeited, the Capitaine conſtrained ſhamefully and in deſpight of his forces without ſound of trompett to raiſe his ſiege: for he fled without euer after troubling the Aſsiſians, being ſhortly after slaine.
               
               
                  Of the reuerence and deuotion which S. Clare had to the most B. Sacrament, and of the vertue of her prayers againſt the Deuils.
                  THE XV. CHAPTER.
                  THe deuotion of S. Clare towardes the moſt precious Sacrament of the Altare was ſuch, that ſhe made it apparent in many of her actions: for though ſhe were moſt grieuously ſick in her bed, yet would ſhe ſo diſpoſe her ſelfe therin, and be ſo propped and ſtayed vp that ſhe might conueniently ſpinne, an exerciſe which ſhe exceedingly affected, and wherin ſhe deſirously employed her ſelfe, and did it delicately: and with the threed of her labour, ſhe cauſed to be wouen very curious and fine cloth, which ſhe employed in furniture for the chalice. She one time got made 50. corporals which ſhe ſent in caſes of ſilke to many Churches of the valley of Spoletun. When ſhe was to receaue the moſt ſacred Sacramēt, before ſhe preſented her ſelfe therunto, ſhe was alwayes

bathed in teares, and ſo with exceeding feare approaching, ſhe did reuerence him that was hidden in the Sacrament, as acknowledging him to be the ſame that gouerneth heauen and earth. Therfore did the deuils ſo much feare the prayer of the eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST S. Clare, as they haue ſundry times declared.
                  A very deuout woman of the biſhoprick of Piſa came to the monaſtery of S. Damian to thanck God &amp; his ſeruant S. Clare, for hauing bin by her merittes, deliuered of fiue deuils that poſſeſſed her, which in goeing out of her body, confeſſed that the prayer of S. Clare did burne them, and to their great confuſion expelled them out of the humane bodies which they poſſeſſed.
               
               
                  Of a merueillous conſolation which S. Clare receaued on the feaſt of the most holy Natiuity.
                  THE XVI. CHAPTER.
                  AS the glorious S. Clare was alwayes in her ſickneſſe with a liuely memory mindfull of her beloued IESVS, ſo was ſhe correſpondently viſited by him in her neceſsities. As once in the night of the Natiuity when the world and Angels did ſo ſolemnly feaſt for the birth of our Redeemer, all the Religious went to the quier to Matines, and left their holy Mother accompanied only with her grieuous infirmity: wherfore hauing begun to meditate on the great miſtery of that night, and lamenting exceedingly that ſhe could not aſsiſt att the diuine ſeruice, ſhe ſighing ſayd. O my God, thou ſeeſt how I remayne here alone! and ending this, ſhe began to heare the Mattins that were ſung in the Church of S. Francis in Aſsiſium, very diſtinctly vnderſtanding the voice of the Religious and the very ſound of the Organes: yet was ſhe not ſo neere the ſaid Church as ſhe might humanly heare what was ſong there: but it muſt neceſſarily be concluded, that this was miraculously don in one of theſe two ſortes: either that the ſinging of the ſaid Religious was by the will of God carryed to S. Clare, or her hearing was extended extraordinarily, and by ſpeciall grace of God, euen to our Lady of Angels neere vnto Aſsiſium. But this S. was further fauoured by a diuine reuelation, which exceedingly comforted and reioyced her for ſhe was by almighty God eſteemed worthy, to ſee in ſpirit his holy cribbe. The morning following, her Religious comming to ſee her, ſhe ſayd: Deere ſiſters, bleſſed be our Lord IESVS CHRIST, that it hath pleaſed him, not to leaue me alone, as you haue don: but know that by the grace of his diuine Maieſty, I haue heard all the ſolemnity and all the ſeruice that this night hath bin performed in the Church of our holy Father S. Francis.
               
               
                  
                  Of the ſpirituall doctrine wherwith S. Clare nourced and eleuated her daughters.
                  THE XVII. CHAPTER.
                  THe virgin S. Clare acknowledged that ſhe was committed to the Pallace of the great king, for gouerneſſe and Miſt
                        •
                     eſle of his deere eſpouſes, therfore did ſhe teach them a ſublime doctrine, and did comfort and aſsiſt them with ſuch loue and pitty, as with wordes cannot be expreſſed. Firſt ſhe taught them to cleare their ſoules of all rumours of the world that they might the more freely attaine to the high ſecrettes of God. She alſo taught them to haue no affection to their carnall kinred, and entierly to forgett their owne houſe, the better to pleaſe IESVS CHRIST. She admoniſhed them alſo to ſurmount and miſpriſe the neceſsities of the body, and to gett a habitt of repreſsing the deceiptes and appetites of the fleſh, by the bridle of reaſon. She likewiſe taught them that the ſubtill ennemy, armed with malice continually addreſse
                        •
                     h his hidden ſnares to ſurpriſe the pure ſoules, and that he tempteth the pious in other ſort then worldlinges. Finally ſhe would haue them ſo employed in handy labour for certaine houres, that they might afterward be more promptly prepared to the deſire of their Creatour, by the exerciſe of prayer, which after their labour they ſhould vndertake, not leauing for ſuch paine, the fire of holy loue, but rather by it, expelling the tepedity of deuotion alredy purchaced. There was neuer ſeene a ſt
                        ••
                     
                     cter obſeruation of ſilence then among them, nor a greater forme and example of vertue. Neuer was there ſeene don in this holy houſe one act of vanity, neither by word, nor ſignes, nor was there diſcouered by any vaine diſcourſe any deſire of lightnes, ſo much were they mortified. Their holy miſtreſſe gaue good example by wordes and by her pious &amp; briefe documentes, ſhe taught her duciples feruent deſires, admoniſhing them to poſſeſſe and conſerue them vnder the keyes and cuſtody of ſtrict ſilence. By meane of deuou
                        •
                      Preachers ſhe procured to her daughters, the holy word of God, wherof her owne was not the leaſt part, ſhe being filled with contentment and ioy when ſhe heard the word of God preached, would with ſuch deuotion and conſolation reioyce in the memory of her ſweeteſt Spouſe IESVS CHRIST, that one time hearing the ſermon of Brother Philipp de Adria, a moſt famous preacher, there was ſeene before this holy virgin a moſt beautifull child, which there remayned during almoſt all the ſermon, comforting her with his ioyfull delectations, of which apparition ſhe receaued ſuch a ſweetnes and delight, as ſhe could

no way explicate.
                  Albeit this moſt prudent virgin had neuer ſtudyed, yet did ſhe much delight to heare a learned man preach, well knowing that vnder the wordes of ſcience lay hidden the ſweetnes of ſpiritt, which her ſelfe more ſubtility obtayned and taſted with more ſauour. She accuſtomed to ſay, that the ſermon of whoſoeuer preaching the word of God was exceeding profitable to ſoules, conſidering that it is no leſſe prudence to know how ſometimes to gather beautifull and ſweet flowers from a mong groſſe and rude thornes, then to eat fruittes of a good plant.
                  Pope Gregory the ninth one time att the inſtance of diuers Prelates, commanded that no Religious ſhould preach att the monaſterie of poore Religious women without his expreſſe permiſsion: wheratt the pittiful mother complayning, in regard that thenceforward her daughters ſhould ſeldome be ſpiritually fed with holy doctrine, with teares ſhe ſayd: Lett then all my Religions be taken hence, ſith they are taken away who gaue vs the food of ſpirituall life. And with all ſent away the Religious that appertayned to her monaſtery to ſerue them in getting almoſe abroad, refuſing to haue Religious that ſhould prouide them bread to reliefe the body, ſith they were depriued her that gaue them bread to nouriſh their ſoules. Wherof his Holineſſe being aduertiſed he reuoked his prohibition, referring all to the diſpoſition of the Generall of the Frere Minors.
                  S. Clare had not only care of her daughters ſoules, but of their bodies alſo that were feeble and tender, for whoſe neceſsities ſhe prouided with exceeding feruour and charity. For ſhe often in the night when it was cold went to viſitt and couer them, whiles they slept. And if ſhe found any ouer-much benummed with cold, or otherwiſe in ill diſpoſition through ſtrict obſeruation of the commune rigour, ſhe commanded them to take ſome recreation, till their neceſsities were ſatisfied. If any of her daughters were troubled with temptations, or were ſorrowfull or melancholie, ſhe would call her a part and louingly comfort her. Sometimes ſhe would fall to the feet of thoſe that were heauy and afflicted, to putt away the force of their griefe by her motherly cheriſhinges, for which they yelding themſelues to this their holy mother, did not proue ingratefull. They reuerenced the office of Prelature in their miſtreſſe, and followed the conduct of ſo diligent and ſecure a guide, and ayming their actions by the eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST, they admired the excellencie of ſuch a ſanctity and charity.
               
               
                  
                  Of the deuotion which Pope Gregoire the ninth bad to the virgin ſainte Clare, and of a latter which he wrote vnto her whiles he was yet Cardinall.
                  THE XVIII. CHAPTER.
                  POpe Gregory the ninth had a merueillous confidence in the prayers of ſaincte Clare, hauing experienced their great vertue &amp; efficacie, and often times when he was in any difficulty, both whiles he was Cardinall and biſhop of Hoſtia, and afterwardes when he was Pope, he would by letters recommend himſelfe to this glorious virgin, demaunding helpe of her, becauſe he knew of what importance her aſsiſtance was; this being in him not only a great humility, but alſo worthy to be dilligently imitated, to ſee the vicar of IESVS CHRIST on earth to begg helpe of a ſeruant of God, in recōmending himſelfe to her prayers. This great Paſtour knew well what diuine loue could doe, and how freely pure virgins doe finde the port of the conſiſtory of the diuine Maieſty open. There is extant a very deuout letter of this Pope, written to ſaincte Clare whiles he was Cardinall, which is here inſerted to make appeare that the ſpiritt of God made his reſidence in this Prelat, and what deuotion he carryed to the ſanctity of the glorious ſaincte Clare.
                  To the moſt deere ſiſter in IESVS CHRIST and mother of his holineſſe, ſiſter Clare the ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST, Vgolin miſerable ſinner, Biſhop of Hoſtia recommendeth himſelfe, what ſoeuer he is and what he may be. Well beloued ſiſter in CHRIST IESVS, ſince the houre that the neceſsity of my retourne ſeparated me from your holy ſpeeches, and depriued me of that pleaſure to conferre with you of celeſtiall treaſures, I haue had much ſorrow of hart, abondance of teares in myne eyes, and haue felt an extreme griefe. In ſuch ſort that if I had not found att the feet of our Lord IESVS CHRIST the conſolation of his ordinary piety, I feare I had fallen into ſuch anguiſhes as my ſpiritt would haue forſaken me, and my ſoule would haue vtterly melted away, and not without reaſon, becauſe that ioy failed me, with which I diſcourſed with your good company of the body of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST and of his preſence on earth, celebrating the feaſt of Eaſter with you and the other ſeruantes of our Lord. And as whiles our Sauiour by his dolorous paſsion and death was abſent from the preſence of his diſciples, they were poſſeſſed with an extreme griefe and affliction, ſo doth your abſence procure my deſolation: and though I acknowledged my ſelfe a grieuous ſinner, conſidering the prerogatiue

of your merittes and the rigour of your holy Religion, I know not out of doubt but that the number and grauity of my ſinnes are ſuch, and ſo much haue I offended God the vniuerſall Lord, that I am not worthy to be vnited to the ſociety of the elect, nor to be ſequeſtred from worldly occupations, if your teares and prayers doe not obtaine me pardon of my ſinnes. And therfore to you I committ my ſoule, to you I commēd my ſpiritt, as IESVS CHRIST on the croſſe recommended his ſpiritt to his Father, to the end that in the terrible day of the vniuerſall iudgement you giue an account for me, if you be not diligent and carefull of my ſaluation. For I confidently beleeue that you may obtaine of the ſoueraigne Iudge whatſoeuer by your deuotion and your teares you ſhall demaund of him. The Pope ſpeaketh not of cōming to Aſsiſium, as I deſire: but I purpoſe to viſitt you and your ſiſters att my firſt commodity. Recommend me to Agnes your ſiſter and mine, and to all your other ſiſters in IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  Of the confirmation of the first rule of ſaincte Clare, inſerted with her rule.
                  THE XIX. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy Father ſainct Francis by inſtruction of the holy Ghoſt, made a rule for ſaincte Clare, and the Religious that intended to follow her, diſtinguiſhed &amp; ordered by chapters conueniēt, and conformable to the Rule of the Frere Minors, which rule this holy Father imparted vnto Cardinall Vgolin, then Biſhop of Hoſtia, who was Protectour of his Order, and was after Pope by the title of Gregory the ninth, who was very affectionate vnto him, and confirmed the ſayd rule in the rigour of a ſtrict pouerty &amp; auſterity of life, not by bulle, but only of his Apoſtolicall authority, and viua voce. The Order of ſaincte Clare had not this rule confirmed by authenticall bull, till the third yeare of the Popedome of Innocent the fourth, which was the yeare 1245. when the ſayd Pope att the inſtance of certaine Prelates and of certaine Abbeſſes of the Religion of ſaincte Clare, inſtituted the ſecond rule for the virgins of this Order, vnder the title of the encloſed Religious of the Order of ſainct Damian, in which rule he diſpēſed with the Religious touching their vow of pouerty in commune, and the confirmation of this rule paſſed in the citty of Lions, which diſpenſation exceedingly afflicted ſaincte Clare and all her Companions, for the zeale they had to the obſeruation of the holy Euangelicall pouerty. And not only the monaſteries which deſired the ſaid diſpenſation and rule of Innocent the fourth, did accept the ſame, but euen other monaſteries were enforced to receaue and follow it. But the Pope being afterward better

enformed, commanded the Generall and all the Prouincialls, that they ſhould in no ſort conſtraine the Abbeſſes and Religious of the Order of S. Clare and of S. Damian to obſerue the rule which he had newly inſtituted: but willed and commanded that the firſt rule giuen by the holy Father ſainct Francis att the beginning of his religion, and confirmed by Pope Gregory the ninth, ſhould be perpetually obſerued, commanding and commending it to the Cardinall of Hoſtia Protector of the Order, to ſee it obſerued, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer appellations, &amp; letters obtayned or to be obtayned.

                     That the Religious of S. Damian may not haue goodes in propriety. Taken out of the 10. booke and put here in due place.
                     INnocent Biſhop, ſeruant of the ſeruantes of God: to his beloued daughter in IESVS CHRIST Clare, and to the other Siſters of the Monaſtery of ſaint Damian of Aſsiſium, as well preſent as to come. Health and Apoſtolicall benediction. Becauſe it is manifeſt that deſiring to be dedicated only vnto God, you haue ſold all your ſubſtāce to diſtribute it among the poore, the better to renounce cogitations and deſires of temporall thinges, and that you haue a firme reſolution not to poſſes in whatſoeuer manner, any kind of poſſeſsions, nor immoueable goodes, in althinges following the ſteppes of him that for vs became poore, the true way, verity and life: The neceſsitie and want of corporall thinges being vnable to deterre or ſeparate you from this firme reſolution,Cant. 1. becauſe the left hand of the celeſtiall Spouſe is vnder your head, to ſuſtaine the great weaknes of your body, which you haue ſubiected to the law of the ſpiritt with an exceeding feruour and charity. This Lord alſoMatt. 6. that feedeth the birdes and cloatheth the flowers of the fieldes, will reward you with himſelfe in eternity, when his right hand ſhall embrace you in the perfect ſight of him. Conſidering withall that with great humility you demaund of vs that of our Apoſtolicall fauour we confirme your ſayd reſolution taken to follow moſt ſtrict pouerty: We by the to nour of theſe preſentes doe graunt you, that you may not be conſtrayned by any whoſeuer, to take, haue, nor to retaine temporall poſſeſſions. And if any ſiſter either will not, or cannot obſerue this rule, lett her not remayne with you, but lett her incontinently be putt in ſome other place. We ordaine and command that no perſon, of whatſoeuer quality or condition he may be, preſume to trouble your Monaſtery. And if any perſon eccleſiaſticall or ſeculer knowing this our▪ conſtitution and

confirmation, be ſo raſh as to attempt in whatſoeuer manner againſt it, and if after three ſeuerall times reprehended and aduertiſed, he do not amend, &amp; make ſatisfaction anſwearable to his default, let him be depriued of his office, dignity and honour, and lett ſuch perſon be reputed as already condemned for his impieties by the iudgement of God, &amp; therfore lett him be cutt off from the moſt holy cōmunion of faithfull Chriſtians, and be obliged to the diuine vengeance att the laſt iudgement. But they who ſhall loue you in IESVS CHRIST and your Order; and eſpecially the Monaſtery of ſainct Damian, the holy peace of God be with them, that they may receaue the fruit of their good worckes, and find the recompence of eternall beatitude in the day of the rigorous and laſt iudgement.
                  
                  
                     The ſequel of the aforeſaid ninth chapter.
                     AFterward the ſame Pope confirmed the firſt rule v
                              •
                           uae vocis oraculo with his owne mouth, formerly approued by the ſayd Pope Gregory the ninth his predeceſſour, and by the Cardinall of Hoſtia Protectour, who by commiſsion receaued from his holineſſe had approued the ſame, in ſuch ſort that this firſt rule was renewed into force. This Pope Innocent afterward confirmed it by his bull in the citty of Aſsiſium, the eight of Auguſt, the ſecond yeare of his Papacie. Whervnto he was enforced by the deuotion and moſt humble requeſt of S. Clare.
                  
                  
                     Apoſtolicall confirmation of the rule which S. Francis gaue to S. Clare.
                     INnocent Biſhop ſeruant of the ſeruantes of God, to our welbeloued daughters in IESVS CHRIST, Clare Abbeſſe and to the other ſiſters of the monaſterie of S. Damian att Aſsiſium, health and Apoſtolicall benediction. The Apoſtolicall ſea accuſtometh to conſent vnto iuſt deſires, &amp; liberally to fauour the vertuous and pious requeſtes of them that ſeeke the ſame. And becauſe you haue humbly required vs, touching the rule according to which you ought to liue in common in one ſpiritt and vow of moſt high pouerty, the ſame rule hauing bin giuen you by the holy Father S. Francis &amp; by you receaued of him with much cōtentment, &amp; which rule our venerable Brother the Biſhop of Hoſtia of Veltré approued, according as is more amply cōtayned &amp; declared in the letters of the ſayd Biſhop, conformable to the commandement which we gaue him to approue it by Apoſtolicall authority to that effect cōmitted vnto him, deſirous now to accord vnto your requeſtes, we confirme againe by theſe preſētes the ſaid rule by our Apoſtolicall authority, cauſing the tenour of this rule to be writtē word by word in theſe preſentes, as followeth.
                     
                        
Vgolin by the grace of God Biſhop of Hoſtia &amp; of Veltré, to his moſt deare mother and daughter in IESVS CHRIST, Clare Abbeſſe of S. Damian att Aſsiſium, and to her Religious as well preſent as to come, health and Fatherly benediction. For ſo much as you my welbeloued daughters in IESVS CHRIST, deſpiſing the pompes and delightes of the world, and following the warlike courſe of IESVS CHRIST and of his moſt ſacred mother, haue choſen to dwell corporally encloſed to ſerue God, we commending your pious reſolution, are willing benignely to graunt with a good will and Fatherly affection your demandes and holy deſires. And therfore inclining to your pious petitions, we by the Popes and our owne authority doe confirme, for you and all thoſe that ſhall ſucceed in your Monaſtery, the forme and rule to liue by meane of a holy vnion and of the moſt high and ſublime pouerty, which the glorions Father ſainct Francis hath giuen you to obſerue, as well by word as by writing: which rule is here vnder ſpecifyed as followeth.
                  
               
               
                  The rule of the Religious of S. Clare, called Damiates.
                  THE FIRST CHAPTER.
                  WE are to begin the rule &amp; forme of life of the ſiſters which the glorious Father S. Francis inſtituted, which is in obſeruation of the holy Ghoſpel, liuing in obedience and chaſtity, without any propriety. Clare the vnworthy ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST, and the litle plant of the holy Father S. Francis, promiſeth obedience and reuerence to Pope Innocent and to his ſucceſſours canonically elected, and to the Romane Church. And as ſhe in the beginning of her conuerſion together with all her ſiſters, hath promiſed inuiolable obedience to his ſucceſſours, lett all her other ſiſters be in like ſort for euer obliged to obey the ſucceſſours of S. Francis, and ſiſter Clare, and other Abbeſſes that ſhall ſucceed her canonically elected.
               
               
                  How the Religious must be receaued into Religion.
                  THE II. CHAPTER.
                  IF any Virgin or woman diuinely inſpired preſent her ſelfe to you to be admitted to this courſe of life, lett the Abbeſſe be obliged to damaund aduiſe of her ſiſters: and if the greater part conſent therto, ſhe may receaue her, after permiſsion had of the Cardinall Protectour of the Order. Bur before the habitt be giuen her, lett her

very diligently examine her, or cauſe her to be examined touching the Catholique Faith, and the holy ſacramentes of the Church. And if ſhe be found ſincerely faithfull in thoſe matters, and doe loyally confeſſe them, and promiſe entierly to obſerue them, and that ſhe be not marryed, or if hauing a husband he by conſent of the Biſhop of the Dioceſe become Religious, hauing vowed continencie, and ſhe not hauing other impediment, as ouer-aged or infirme, or want of iudgement, and diſcretion to obſerue ſuch courſe of life, lett the manner and rule of liuing be dilligently declared vnto her: then being found capable, the wordes of the goſpell be denounced vnto her, that ſhe goe and ſell all ſhe hath, and endeauour to diſtribute it vnto the poore: which if ſhe cannot effect, her good will ſhall ſuffice. And lett the Abbeſſe and other ſiſters be carefull not to confound their cogitations with her temporall affaires: but lett them leaue that care to her, that ſhe diſpoſe of her ſubſtance as our Lord ſhall inſpire her. And if ſhe demaund counſaile of them thervpon, lett them direct her to ſome vertuous perſon that feareth God, by whoſe counſaile ſhe ſhall diſpoſe of her goodes among the poore. After that, hauing cutt her haire about her garment, and diſcloathed her of her ſeculer attire lett be giuen her three coates, one cloake, and lett her no more be permitted to goe out of the Monaſtery without profitable, manifeſt and probable occaſion. The yeare of her probation expired, lett her be receaued to obedience, promiſing perpetually to obſerue the life and rule of our pouerty. None may weare the vaile but after the yeare of probation and nouitiat: the ſiſters alſo may weare a cloake, to be more lighty, decently and commodiously prepared to labour. Lett the Abbeſſe diſcretly prouide thē cloathing according to the qualities of the perſonnes, places and time, and correſpondent to neceſsity. The virgins that are receaued into the monaſtery before their age conuenient, lett their haire be cutt, and being diſattired of their ſeculer garmentes, lett them be cloathed with the ſame cloath that the other Religious do vſe, as it ſhall pleaſe the Abbeſſe, and hauing attayned age conuenient, lett them be cloathed as the other, and make their probation. And lett the Abbeſſe commende them, as alſo the other Nouices to a miſtreſſe, whome ſhe ſhould chooſe of the moſt vertuous of the monaſtery, who ſhall carefully inſtruct them according to the order of our profeſsiō. Lett the forme aforeſaid be obſerued in the examination made to receaue the ſiſters that are to ſerue without the Monaſtery, and they may weare hoſe and ſhooes, and lett no woman or mayden dwell in the Monaſtery among you, if ſhe be not receaued according to the forme of your profeſsion. My deere and welbeloued ſiſters, I admoniſh, pray, and require you for the loue of IESVS CHRIST, who comming into the world

was wrapped in poore cloutes, and then by his moſt ſacred mother layd in a manger, that you alwayes cloath your ſelues with the pooreſt and courſeſt cloath, and the meaneſt that you can poſsibly.
               
               
                  Of the manner of ſaying the diuine office, of fasting, and of the time of communicating.
                  THE III. CHAPTER.
                  THe Religious that can read, ſhall ſay the diuine office according to the vſe of the Frere Minors, when they may haue a Breuiary, and ſhall read it without ſinging, and they who ſometimes vpon ſome light impediment, cannot read the office, ſhall ſay their Pater noſters as the others ſiſters that cannot read, who ſhall ſay for their Mattins twenty four times the Pater noſter, for Laudes fiue, For the Prime, Third, Sixt, and Ninth houre for each ſeauen times the Pater Noſter, for the Euenſong twelue times, and for Compline ſeauen times. They alſo ſhall ſay for the euenſong of the dead, ſeauen times the Pater Noſter with Requiem aeternam, and for the Matins twelue times. And the ſiſters that can read ſhall ſay the office of the dead. When any Religious of the Monaſtery ſhall dye, the ſiſters ſhall ſay fifty Pater Noſters for her ſoule.
                  The ſiſters, ſhall faſt att all times: but on the Natiuity of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, fall it on whatſoeuer day, they may eat two meales. The yong, the weake, and the ſeruantes that liue out of the Monaſtery, may be diſpenſed withall for their faſtes by mercy and charity, according to the diſcretion of the Abbeſſe. But in time of manifeſt neceſsity, the ſiſters ſhall not be obliged to corporall faſt.
                  Lett them with permiſsion of the Abbeſſe, confeſſe twelue times in the yeare: lett them be exceeding wary not to entermingle any wordes in their confeſsion, but what is neceſſary thervnto and for the ſaluation of their ſoules.
                  Lett the ſiſters communicate ſeauen times a yeare, to witt att the Natiuity of our Lord, Maundie thurſday, att Eaſter, Aſcenſion day, Whitſonday, on the Aſſumption of the Virgin Mary, and Alſaintes: ſince the canonization of ſainct Francis, for the eight communion, is added the day of his feaſt. It ſhalbe permiſſable for the chappelain to communicate the ſick within the Monaſtery.
               
               
                  
                  How the Abbeſſe is to be choſen.
                  THE IV. CHAPTER.
                  THe Religious ſhalbe obliged to obſerue the canonicall forme in election of their Abbeſſe, where they ſhall endeauour to haue the Generall of the Frere Minors, or att leaſt the Prouinciall, who may by the word of God vnite them, and admoniſh them to agree, touching the election of their Abbeſſe, to doe what ſhall ſeeme to them moſt profitable aduertiſing them not to chooſe a Religious that is not profeſſed: and if one ſhould be elected before profefsion, and made Abbeſſe by any other meane, lett not ſuch Abbeſſe be obeyed, till ſhe haue made profeſsion conformably to the ordonances and to the rule of our pouerty. And the terme of her chardge being ended, lett an other be choſen. And if ſometimes after the election of the Abbeſſe all the ſiſters iudge her vncapable of ſuch chardge for the good of the ſeruice of God and of their Monaſtery, lett them be bound and obliged to chooſe an other, as ſoone as they can according to the ſaid rule.
                  And lett her that ſhalbe choſen conſider well what is the burthen which ſhe hath taken on her, and to whome ſhe muſt yeld an account of the ſheep wherof ſhe hath taken chardge. Lett her endeauour to be rather Superiour to precede her Religious in vertues and pious conuerſation, then in honour and dignity: to the end that the ſiſters induced by her example, obey her more for loue then for feare.
                  Lett not her carry any particuler affection, for feare that in louing one ſhe may ſcandalize others, lett her comfort the afflicted, and be alwayes the firſt and laſt in aſsiſting art diuine ſeruice. Lett her be the reliefe and recourſe of the afflicted, that if the remedies of ſaluation faile them, ſhe att leaſt exempt and deliuer them from the diſeaſe of deſpaire. Lett her haue a very diligent care of the comunalty in all thinges, but principally in the Church, in the dormitory, in the refectory, in the infirmary, and in their cloathing: And lett her Vicareſſe be in like ſort obliged to all the aforeſaid.
                  Lett the Abbeſſe be obliged to aſſemble all her Religious in the chapiter att leaſt once a weeke, in which place as well ſhe as the others, ſhall accuſe themſelues of all their publike ſinnes and of all their defaultes and negligences. Then lett her there treat and conſult with her ſiſters of the affaires of their Monaſtery, becauſe God doth oftentimes communicate and giue his ſpiritt to the meaneſt of the company.
                  
                     
Lett her not enter into great or important debt, but by the common conſent of all the Religious and vpon a manifeſt neceſsity, and withall lett it be by the entermile and mediation of the Procuratour of the monaſtery. Lett the Abbeſſe, as alſo the ſiſters, be carefull not to receaue any pledge or gage into their Monaſtery in regard of the troubles, encombers, and ſcandales that often arriue therby. Lett all the officers of the monaſtery be alſo elected by the common conſent of the Religious, the better to entertaine peace and fraternall vnion among them; and likewiſe ſhalbe choſen and elected att leaſt eight Religious of the moſt diſcreet, of whome the Abbeſſe ſhalbe obliged to take counſaile in ſuch matters as our rule requireth. The Religious likewiſe may and ought, if they know it to be neceſſary, put out ſuch officers as are indiſcreet and incapable, and chooſe others in their places.
               
               
                  Of ſilence and of the manner of ſpeaking in the ſpeake houſe and att the grate.
                  THE V. CHAPTER.
                  THe ſiſters ſhall keep ſilence from Cōpline till the Third hower, thoſe except that ſerue without the monaſtery. But let it be alwayes kept in the dormitory and in the Church, as alſo in the refectory att the houre of repaſt, ſauing in the infirmary were the Religious may alwayes ſpeake diſcreetly for the recreation and ſeruices of the ſicke. They may alſo briefly and in a low voice open their neceſsities. It ſhall not be permiſſable for any ſiſters to ſpeake att the ſpeakehouſe or grate with out permiſsiō of the Abbeſſe or of her Vicareſſe. And lett not thoſe that haue leaue to ſpeake in the ſpeakehouſe, preſume to ſpeake there but in the preſence of two ſiſters, that may heare whatſoeuer is there ſpoaken. But lett them not preſume to goe to the grate, if there be not att leaſt three ſiſters preſent, ſent by the Abbeſſe or her Vicareſſe, who ſhalbe of thoſe that are choſen by the Religious to be Counſailers to the Abbeſſe. And lett the Abbeſſe and Vicareſſe be obliged to obſerue this order of ſpeaking as much as ſhalbe poſsible, and lett not any ſpeake att the grate but very rarely, and att the gate neuer. Lett there be putt before the grate within to couer it, a curtaine of black cloth, which ſhall not be drawne but for more conuenient hearing the ſermon, or when a ſiſter would ſpeake with any one: Lett no Religious ſpeake att the grate with whome ſoeuer in the morning before the ſunne ariſe, not att night after the ſunne is ſett. Lett there be alwayes a black cloth before the ſpeakehouſe within-ſide, which ſhall

neuer be drawne. Lett no ſiſter ſpeake in the lent of S. Martin, nor in the ordinary lent in the ſpeakehouſe but to a Prieſt, to confeſſe, or for ſome other manifeſt neceſsity, which ſhalbe referred to the diſcretion of the Abbeſſe, or her Vicareſſe.
               
               
                  That the Religious may not receiue nor haue any Poſſeſsions, nor any thing proper, in their owne, or any third perſons Custody.
                  THE VI. CHAPTER.
                  Here is an adiunction of S. Clare, proper to her rule, which hath bin here annexed ſince the death of S. Francis.
                  IT hauing pleaſed he moſt high celeſtiall Father to illuminate my hart with his diuine grace, that I might doe penance by the example and doctrine of the holy Father S. Francis, a litle after his conuerſion, my ſelfe and my Religious promiſed obedience vnto him. Now the holy Father ſeeing that we feared no kind of pouerty, labour, affliction, or contempt of the world, yea that all theſe thinges did exceedingly content vs, hauing compaſsion of vs, he preſcribed vnto vs a rule to liue in this manner. Sith you are become daughters and ſeruātes of the moſt high, by diuine inſpiration of our Redeemer, and that you haue reſigned and committed your ſelues to the conduct of the holy ghoſt, I will and promiſe for my ſelfe and my Religious to haue alwayes care of you as of our ſelues, and this with a particuler care and diligence: which I will carefully accompliſh and obſerue during my life, and will that my Religious very diligently accompliſh and obſerue the ſame for euer. Now to the end we might neuer leaue the moſt holy pouerty which we haue vndertaken, &amp; that this might be knowen to thoſe that ſhal ſucceed vs, a litle before his death he left vs his laſt will in theſe termes: I Br. Francis poore wretch and caitife, will follow the life and pouerty of my moſt high Lord IESVS CHRIST, and of his moſt holy mother, and therin perſeuer to the end. And I beſeech all you poore ſiſters, and counſaile you to liue alwayes in this moſt holy life of pouerty, and aboue althinges to keep your ſelues from forſaking it, vpon whoſe counſaile or doctrine ſoeuer that would perſuade you the contrary. But now as my ſelfe and alſo all my ſiſters haue euer bin carefull to obſerue the holy pouerty which we haue promiſed to God and to our holy Father S. Francis, I deſire alſo that the Abbeſſes, which ſhall hereafter come to ſucceed me in this chardge, be obliged, with all their Religious, to haue diligent and inuiolable care not to receaue poſſeſsions, inheritances, or other thinges proper whatſoeuer reſerued

of their owne, or from others that may giue them, nor whatſoeuer other thing that may be called proper, but that which ſhalbe needefull to a requiſite neceſsity of the Monaſtery. Neuertheles they may haue and poſſeſſe a litle ground to make a garden, to ſupply the neceſsities and ſeruices of the ſiſters.
               
               
                  How and in what ſort the Religious muſt labour and exerciſe themſelues.
                  THE VII. CHAPTER.
                  THe ſiſters to whome God hath giuen grace and ability to labour, after the third houre they may employ themſelues in ſome decent exerciſe and conuenient to their profeſſion, that may be for the common profitt, ſincerely and deuoutly: yet in ſuch ſort that expelling idlenes, the capitall ennemy of the ſoule, the ſpiritt of holy prayer and deuotion be not extinguiſhed, wherto all other tēporall thinges ought to ſerue. And what they ſhall haue wrought with their handes, they ſhall bring to the chapter before all the other Religious, deliuering the ſame to the Abbeſſe or to her vicareſſe. The ſame ſhall likewiſe be done touching all the almes that ſhalbe ſent to the monaſtery, by whome ſoeuer, that ſome prayers be offered in common, for ſuch beneſactours: and then ſuch thinges ſhalbe diſtributed according to the common neceſsitie, by the Abbeſſe or her vicareſſe, with the conſent of the diſcreet or Counſailers of the Abbeſſe.
               
               
                  That the Religions may not appropriat any thing to them ſelues, and of the ſick ſisters.
                  THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                  LEtt not the Religious haue any thing in propriety: but lett them ſerue God in this world as pilgrimes and ſtrangers in all pouerty and humility, ſeeking almoſe with confidence, and they muſt not be aſhamed therof, conſidering that our Lord IESVS CHRIST became poore for vs in this world. It is this ſublimity of the moſt high pouerty, that maketh and inſtituteth you, my beloued ſiſters, heires of the ceſtiall kingdome, making your ſelues poore of temporall cōmodities, to be ennobled with celeſtiall vertues. Lett it be your part and portion, to conduct you to the land of the liuing: wherto to arriue my deereſt ſiſters, for the loue of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, deſpiſe and haue no regard to gett any other thing.
                  Let it not be permitted to any Religious to ſend or receaue letters,

nor to take or conuey any thing in, or out of the Monaſtery without leaue of the Abbeſſe. Lett it neither be permiſſable to any Religious to keep any thing that is not giuen or permitted her by her Abbeſſe or Vicareſſe. And if their kindred or others ſend any thing to the Religious, lett the Abbeſſe cauſe it to be deliuered: And if that Religious to whome it is ſent haue need therof, ſhe may vſe it: if not an other that hath need may of charity vſe it. And if mony be ſent, the Abbeſſe by aduiſe of the diſcreetes, ſhall therwith prouide and ſupply the wants of her to whome it is ſent. Lett the Abbeſſe be obliged to haue care of the ſick ſiſters, as well to comfort them, as to procure by her ſelfe and others, that which their infirmity requireth, touching their diett and other thinges neceſſary, according to the poſsibility of the place: and lett them be prouided for with charity and compaſsion: Conſidering that all the Religious are bound to sſsiſt, ſuccour and ſerue their ſick ſiſters, as they in the like caſe would expect of others. And lett one ſiſter ſecurely manifeſt and diſcouer her neceſsities to an other: in regard that if ſhe that is a true mother, doe loue and cheriſh her carnall child, with what greater dilligence and care ought a ſiſter to loue &amp; cheriſh her ſpirituall ſiſter? and therfore it ſhalbe permitted to lay the ſicke on beddes of chaffe, and to giue them a pillow filled with downe or ſoft feathers, and they that haue need to be layd on Mattereſſes filled with wooll, and to haue coueringes, it may be graunted them. When the ſaid ſick ſiſters ſhalbe viſited by them that enter into the monaſtery, they may briefely anſweare them in diſcourſe of edification. And lett not the others ſiſters that ſhall haue leaue to ſpeake, yet preſume to doe it to thoſe that enter into the Monaſtery, if there be not two of the diſcreetes preſent to heare what they ſhall ſay, whome the Abbeſſe or her Vicareſſe ſhall nominate: and lett the Abbeſſe her ſelfe and the Vicareſſe be obliged alſo to obſerue this forme of ſpeaking.
               
               
                  Of the penance fitt to be giuen to the Religious vpon occaſions, and of the manner of negotiation without the Monaſtery.
                  THE IX. CHAPTER.
                  IF any Religious be ſo forgetfull as to ſinner mortally againſt the rule or inſtitutions of your profeſsion, by the inſtigation of the deuill, hauing bin once and twice reprehended and chaptered for it by the Abbeſſe, and euen by the other Religious, without amendement: As many dayes as ſhe remayneth obſtinate lett her eat but bread and drinck water in the refectory, before all the other ſiſters and vpon the ground: afterwardes lett her be enioyned to a greater pēnance, att the

pleaſure of the Abbeſſe. And lett her be prayed for, during her abſtinencie, demaunding of God to illuminate her hart, and to reduce her to pennance. Lett the Abbeſſe and the Religious be wary not to be much offended or troubled att the ſinne of any of their ſiſters, becauſe anger and vexation, of it ſelfe hindereth charity towardes ones neighbour. If it ſhould happen, which God, if he pleaſe, forbid, that the ſiſters ſhould fall into contentious wrangling againſt one an other, and ſhould vtter wordes of ſcandall, ſhe that ſhalbe cauſe therof, lett her, before ſhe offer any prayer to IESVS CHRIST, goe fall on her knees to the feet of the other, and not only demaund pardon of her, but lett her entreat her to pray to our Lord to pardon her. And the party offended, remembringIuc. 6. the wordes of our Lord, ſaying: If you forgiue not with a good hart, no more will your heauenly Father forgiue you, lett her moſt willingly and freely pardon her ſiſter all the iniuryes ſhe may haue receaued of her.
                  Lett the lay ſiſters that ſerue without the monaſtery, and trauell abroad, neuer goe forth of the monaſtery but vpon ſome manifeſt neceſsity. Lett them goe modeſtly and ſpeake litle, that the perſonnes with whome they haue affaires, be edified by them: And lett them haue a ſpeciall care not to be in company that may be ſuſpected, nor to entertaine any euill counſaile. Lett them not be Goſsips to men or women, for feare that ſome occaſion of murmure doe ariſe therof.
                  And lett them not be ſo bold as to recount vnto the Monaſterie the newes of worldly matters and affaires, and lett them be moſt ſtrictly obliged not to report abroad any thing done or ſpoaken in the monaſtery that may occaſion ſcandale. And if one of them doe ſimplie fall into one of theſe errours, it ſhall reſt in the diſcretion of the Abbeſſe to giue her a pennance anſwearable to her offence, yet with compaſsion, which ſhe ſhall doe by the aduiſe and counſaile of the greater part of the diſcreetes.
               
               
                  How the Abbeſse ought to viſit her Religious.
                  THE X. CHAPTER.
                  LEtt the Abbeſſe viſitt her Religious, admoniſh, reprehēd and correct them with charity, not commanding them any thing againſt their ſoule and the Order of your profeſsion. Lett the Religious be mindefull alſo that for the loue of God they haue renounced their proper will: and that therfore they are obliged in all thinges to obey their Abbeſſe, according to their promiſe, prouided that it be not againſt their ſaluation and your profeſsion. Lett the Abbeſſe vſe ſuch familiarity with her Religious, that they may comport themſelues as miſtreſſes

towardes their ſeruantes: for in ſuch ſort muſt they liue together, as that the Abbeſſe be ſeruant to all her Religious. I alſo exhort my ſiſters, and in the name of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, I admoniſh them, to beware of pride, of vaine glory, of enuy, of auarice, of cogitations and ſolicitude of worldly affaires: not to ſpeake euill of any, to ſhunne diſſention, murmure and diuiſion: but lett them be all carefull to preſerue vnity of fraternal loue, which is the knott of perfection. Beſides, they that cannot read, lett them not regard to learne, but lett them only conſider, that they ought aboue althinges to deſire to haue the ſpiritt of IESVS CHRIST and his holy operation, that they ought alwayes to pray vnto God with purity of hart, &amp; to be humble and patientin afflictions and in their ſickneſſes, and that they ought to loue them that reprehend them, becauſe our lord ſayth: Bleſſed are they they that ſuffer perſecution for iuſtice: for theirs is the kingdome of heauen. He that ſhall perſeuer vnto the end ſhalbe ſaued.
               
               
                  Of the duety of the Portreſſe.
                  THE XI. CHAPTER.
                  THe Portreſſe muſt be prudent and of good conuerſation ripe, of yeares and fitt to remayne and reſide all the day long att the cell of the port, the dore wherof ſhalbe alwayes open: She muſt haue and keep with her a fitt companion, which ſhalbe appoynted her by the Abbeſſe or Vicareſſe, to call any, or to doe what occaſions and occurances ſhall require. The port or gate ſhabe of two folding leaues and faſtened with two lockes and padlockes which in the night ſhalbe ſhutt with two keyes, wherof the Abbeſſe ſhall haue one and the Portreſſe the other. The port ſhall neuer be without guard by day, and ſhalbe ſhutt with one key only. But it muſt be moſt dilligently guarded, very reſpectiue care being taken that it neuer be open but vpon neceſsity. When any one commeth to enter, they ſhall not be opened vnto him, but vpon permiſsion formerly had of the Pope or the Protectour to enter into the monaſtery: where it ſhall not be lawfull for any perſon to enter before the ſunne riſing, or after ſunne ſett. Nor lett the Religious permitt any to enter into their monaſtery but vpon reaſonable, manifeſt and ineuitable occaſion. If it be permitted to a Biſhop to celebrat within the monaſtery to bleſſe the Abbeſſe, to conſecrate a Religious, or for any other important occaſion, lett him be content to enter with the leaſt traine and moſt decencie that may be. When it ſhalbe neceſſary for any Officer or worckman to come in for ſome worck of importance, lett the Abbeſſe place ſome fitt perſon att the gate to admitt only thoſe into the

Monaſtery that ſhall haue employment: and lett the Religious then vſe all endeauour to keep themſelues out of the ſight of thoſe that come in.
               
               
                  How the Monaſtery is to be viſited.
                  THE XII. CHAPTER.
                  YOur Viſitor ought alwayes to be of the O
                        •
                     der of the Frere Minors, ſuch as ſhalbe conſtituted and commanded by the Cardinall your Protectour: and yet he muſt be of a life generally knowne for pious and exemplar. His office ſhalbe to correct the exceſſes committed againſt the order of your profeſsion as well in the head as in the members. The ſaid viſitor muſt ſpeake vnto you in publike place, that he may be ſeene of all. It is permitted him to ſpeake with many Religious or with one alone, of matters concerning the viſitation, as he ſhall thinck moſt to the purpoſe. You ſhall haue ordinarily without, yet neere to your Monaſtery, foure Religious, wherof one ſhalbe your Chaplen, who ſhall haue alſo a companion that ſhalbe a Preiſt of good report and diſcretion, and two lay brothers of vertuous and pious life, for the helpe and ayd of your pouerty, as we haue alwayes compaſsionatly found the ſaid Order of the Frere Minors: which we ſtill demaund as a ſinguler fauour of the ſaid Order for the loue of God and of the glorious Father S. Francis. And lett it neuer be permitted to the Chaplen to enter into the ſayd Monaſtery without the other Prieſt his companion. And lett thoſe that ſhall enter alwayes remaine in ſome publike place, in ſuch ſort as they may ſee one an other. And to heare the confeſsions of the ſick that cannot come to the ſpeakhouſe, to adminiſter vnto them the communion and extreme vnction, and to aſsiſt them in the agonies of death, it ſhalbe permiſſable for the ſayd prieſtes to enter in; and alſo for the ſolemne Maſſes and obſequies for the dead, or for the buriall, the Abbeſſe may admitt into the Monaſtery perſonnes of vnderſtāding and fitt for that purpoſe. And withall this, lett the Religious be alwayes obliged to haue for their Protectour, Gouernour and Correctour, a Cardinall of the Romane Church, who ſhalbe by his Holineſſe appointed vnto the Frere Minors: to the end they may be alwayes in ſubmiſsion and ſubiection to the feet of the ſame Church, firme and ſtable in the Catholique faith, perpetually obſeruing the pouerty and humility of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, any his moſt holy mother.
                  
                     
                     Thus endeth the rule of the poore Religious women, giuen att Peruſia the 16. of September the 10. yeare of the Papedome of Innocent the fourth.
                     The ſequel is the remainder of the 19. chapter.
                     LEtt not any perſeon be permitted to breake or rent this our letter and bull of confirmation, and lett none be ſo bold or raſh as to contradict it. And if any preſume to doe it, lett him know that he ſhall incurre the diſgrace and malediction of God &amp; his holy Apoſtles ſainct Peter and ſainct Paul. Giuen att Aſsiſium the 9. of Auguſt, the 11. yeare of our raigne.

                  Of the the moſt feruent loue of Ieſus Chriſt which enflamed the hart of S. Clare, and how the deuill tormented her: of an extaſie wherin she continued a night and two dayes together.
                  THE XX. CHAPTER.
                  WHen S. Clare heard ſpeake of the paſsion our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, ſhe oftē accuſtomēd to weepe in cōpaſſion, in ſuch ſort that out of the ſacred woundes ſhe would ſometimes draw dolorous feelinges &amp; affectiōs, and att other times ioyes and conſolations of admirable ſweetnes. And the croſſe of IESVS CHRIST, which with her Spouſe ſhe carryed in her ſoule, and the weight therof gaue her ſo much more taſt of contētment as ſhe felt more griefe. The great abondance of teares which ſhe powred out for the paſsion of IESVS CHRIST, kept her ſometimes out of her ſelfe, and the internall loue which ſhe had imprinted in her hart, in manner continually repreſented vnto her IESVS CHRIST crucified.
                  She ordinarily gaue exāple by worckes, of what ſhe taught her Religious by wordes. For admoniſhing them often and inſtructing them ſecretly touching ſome exerciſe, before ſhe had ended her diſcourſe, ſhe was ſeene to power out of her eyes abondance of teares. Among the houres of the diuine office that are ſung in the Church, ſhe was preſent with greateſt deuotion att the Sixt and ninth, by reaſon that att ſuch houres ſhe was crucified with her Redeemer IESVS CHRIST.
                  The holy Virgin retyring one time to her priuate deuotion after the ninth houre, the deuill came to her, and did beat her outragiouſly,

and euen did ſo hurt her in the face, that her eye was all bloud-ſhott and the ſigne remayned on her cheeke: but S. Clare omitted nor for that to perſeuer in her prayer. And to the end ſhe might with the more deuotion apply herſelfe to the cōtentmentes which ſhe conceaued in mediating of IESVS CHRIST crucified, ſhe ordinarily contemplated the miſtery of the fiue woundes: and therfore ſhe learned by hart the office of the croſſe, as the true louer of the croſſe S. Fancis had taught her. She accuſtomed to weare againſt her naked fleſh a girdle of thirteene knottes, wherto alſo were litle ſtones faſtened in forme of knottes: which ſhe did for a ſecrett memory of the woundes and doulours of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST. One lent vpon Maundy thurſday, wheron our Lord IESVS CHRIST ſhewed a particuler loue to his diſciples, att the houre of the agony that our Redeemer did ſweat bloud and water in the garden, this holy virgin retyred into her oratory full of deep ſorrow, and ioyned herſelfe with almighty God in prayer as if ſhe had ſeen him praying, and as if, by contemplation of the ſoule of IESVS CHRIST ſorrowfull euen to death, ſhe her ſelfe had felt and ſuffered his priſon, his deriſions, his iniuries, reproches, affrontes, beatinges, ſentence, croſſe and moſt ignominious death, carrying in her memory a like ſorrow, wherfore as vtterly tranſported, ſhe ſate on a ſtraw-bed, and all that night and the day following, ſhe was ſo abſorpt and rapt out of her ſelfe, that her eyes being open and without motion, ſhe ſeemed to hold them fixed in one place, and remayned ſo inſenſible being conioyntly crucified with IESVS CHRIST, that a Religious familier vnto her, comming often to ſee if ſhe wanted any thing, ſhe found her alwayes in one ſame manner. But on the night of holy ſaterday, this deuout Religious came to her deere mother with a candle, and partly by ſignes and partly by wordes, ſhe made her, the beſt ſhe could, to vnderſtand the commandement that the holy Father ſainct Francis gaue her, that ſhe ſhould not paſſe one day without taking and eating ſomething. So in the preſence of this Religious, ſainte Clare, as if ſhe came out of another place, ſayd vnto her: what need haue you to light this candle? is it not day? Wherto the Religious anſweared: Mother, the night of holy thurſday is paſt, as alſo goodfriday, and we are now in the night of Eaſter eue. The Sainct replyed: my daughter, bleſſed be this ſleep which almighty God att length after my long deſire hath granted me. But I admoniſh and command you, not to ſpeake herof to any creature liuing, whiles I ſhall liue in the world.
               
               
                  
                  Of many miracles wrought by ſaincte Clare by the ſigne and vertue of the croſſe.
                  THE XXI. CHAPTER.
                  OVr Redeemer IESVS CHRIST recompenced well the pious deſires and good worckes of his beloued Virgin ſaincte Clare: for as ſhe was enflamed with an infinite loue of the miſteries of the holy croſſe, ſo by the vertue and power of the ſame croſſe, ſhe became noble in the ſignes &amp; miracles of IESVS CHRIST. Oftentimes in making the ſigne of the croſſe on the ſicke, they were miraculously cured, and indifferently of all ſortes of diſeaſes.
                  A Religious man called Stephen, hauing a hote feuer that exceedingly afflicted him, the holy Father ſainct Francis ſent him to ſaincte Clare, to make the ſigne of the croſſe vpon him, as one that well knew her perfection and vertue, which he exceedingly honoured. Now the Lady Hortulana mother of ſaincte Clare was then in the Couent of ſaint Damian: for a litle before, conſidering that her daughters had eſpouſed IESVS CHRIST, ſhe came to them to Religion, where this happy lady ſerued as a true Gardener in that Garden encloſed with thoſe virgins, our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, and with the glorious Agnes ſiſter to ſainte Clare, and the other Religious all repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt, to whome the holy Father ſaint Francis ſent many diſeaſed whome they cured, after hauing made on them the ſigne of the croſſe, which they moſt hartely honoured. The ſayd Religious then being ſent to ſainte Clare, ſhe, as the daughter of obedience being therto commanded by the holy Father Saint Francis, preſently made on him the ſigne of the croſſe, then left him a litle to sleep in the Church, in the place where ſhe was accuſtomed to pray, and the Religious hauing a litle repoſed, aroſe ſound, ſecure, and freed of his infirmity: then he retourned to ſaint Francis, by whome he had bene ſent to ſaint Damian, and conſequently was cured.
                  A child of three yeares old of the citty of Spoletum called Matthew, had by chaunce a ſtone thruſt into his noſe, whence it could not be gotten out, ſo that the child was in extreme perill: whervpon he was brought to ſaincte Clare, who hauing made the ſigne of the croſſe on him, the ſtone incontinently fell out of his noſe, and he was perfectly well.
                  An other child of Peruſia hauing a filme on his eye was brought to ſainte Clare, who touching the eye of the child, and making the ſigne of the croſſe theron, willed them that had preſented the child vnto her,

to carry it vnto her mother that ſhe might alſo make the ſigne of the croſſe vpon it, which hauing done the eye became cleare, and being purged of the filme that obſcured it, he was preſently cured, whervpon ſainte Clare affirmed that this miracle was wrought by the merittes of her mother, who finding ſuch glory to be attributed vnto her, reputed her ſelfe vnworthy therof.
                  One of her Religious called Beneuanta, hauing had for twelue yeares together an impoſtume vnder her arme, which did purge by fiue ſeuerall iſſues, ſaincte Clare had compaſsion therof and made on her the vertuous ſigne of the croſſe: then with her owne handes taking away the playſter, ſhe was cured of her long continued ſores. An other of her Religious called Aimia, being for more then a yeares ſpace afflicted with the dropſy, together with an extreme paine in her ſides and a burning feeuer, ſainte Clare conceaued a very ſtrong compaſsion of her, &amp; therfore hauing recourſe to her noble and infallible medicine, ſhe made on her body the ſigne of the croſſe in the name of her beloued IESVS CHRIST, &amp; the Religious was perfectly cured. An other ſeruāt of God borne att Peruſia, had for two yeares ſo loſt her voice that one could ſcarcely heare her ſpeake: but hauing vnderſtood by a viſiō which ſhe had the night of the Aſſuption of our Lady, that ſainte Clare ſhould cure her: the poore afflicted creature hauing very impatiently expected the breake of day, repayred with a ſtrōg confidēce vnto that holy virgin, and by ſignes craued her benedictiō: which fauour hauing obtayned, her voice which ſo lōg time ſhe had wāted, became as cleare and ſhrillas euer it had bin. An other Religious called Chriſtina that had bin lōg time deafe in one of her eares, &amp; had in vaine tried many remedies, S. Clare hauing made the ſigne of the croſſe on her head, &amp; with her hād touched her eare, ſhe recouered her hearing as perfectly and clearly as before. An other Religious called Andrea had a diſeaſe in her throat, the griefe wherof procured her much impatiēce: it was admirable, that among ſo many prayers enflamed with diuine loue, there ſhould be a ſoule ſo cold, &amp; among ſuch prudent virgins, one ſo indiſcreet &amp; vncōſiderate. This Religious feeling her ſelfe one night more tormēted with her infirmity then ordinarily, afflicted &amp; impatiēt that her paine did rather encreaſe thē diminiſh, ſhe ſo cruſhed &amp; preſſed her throat, that ſhe made appeare her intentiō to choake her ſelfe, thincking by violēce to expell that ſwelling, ſo to auoyd longer torment &amp; by ignorāce attempting to doe more then was the will of God. But whiles that poore Religious buſied her ſelfe in this folly, ſaincte Clare by diuine inſpiration had knoledge therof, wherfore calling one of her Religious ſhe willed her to haſten downe and boyle an egge in the ſhell and cauſe ſiſter Andrea to ſwallow it, which done to bring her to her preſence. The Religious inſtātly dreſſed the egge, and forthwith brought

it to the ſicke party, whome ſhe found litle better then dead, hauing ſo cruſhed her throat that her ſpeech was vtterly gone, yet ſhe made her ſwallow the egge as wel as ſhe could: then raiſing her frō her ſtrawbed, ſhewith much labour led her to S. Clare, who thus ſpake vnto her: Wretched ſiſter confeſſe thee to God, and haue contrition for what thou intendedſt to doe, and acknoledge that IESVS CHRIST will giue thee health far better then thou with thy owne handes haddeſt purpoſed to doe: change thy euill life into a better, for thou ſhalt neuer recouer an other ſickneſſe that ſhall ſucced this, but ſhalt dye therof. Theſe wordes procured in this Religious a ſpiritt of compunction and contrition, ſo that ſhe, being entierly cured of this grieuous infirmity, amended her life; and a litle after ſhe fell into an other ſicknes which ſaincte Clare had foretold, wherof ſhe ended her life piously.
                  It doth manifeſtly appeare by theſe examples and by many other merueillous thinges, which this holy virgin wrought by this healthfull ſigne, that the tree of the croſſe of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST was deeply planted in her hart, and that in a merueillous manner the fruites did interiourly recreat her ſoule: ſith the leaues therof did exteriourly worck ſuch remedies, by the handes and merittes of this glorious ſainct.
               
               
                  How ſaincte Clare bleſſed bread, wheron the ſigne of the croſse miraculously remayned.
                  THE XXII. CHAPTER.
                  S. Clare was a diſciple of the croſſe, of ſuch notable fame and ſanctity, that not only great prelats and Cardinals much deſired to ſee her, to heare and diſcourſe with her, for which cauſe they often viſited her: but the Pope himſelfe boare her alſo this affection, in ſo much that Pope Innocēt the fourth repayred to her Monaſtery, to heare of her, as a ſecretary of the holy Ghoſt, celeſtiall and diuine diſcourſes. And hauing a long time conferred with her of matters of ſaluatiō &amp; of the prayſes of God, whiles they entertayned thēſelues in ſo pious a diſcourſe, S. Clare cauſed the dinner to be prepared, &amp; the tables for the Religious to be couered, cauſing bread to be brought thither, with intentiō to procure the Vicar of IESVS CHRIST to bleſſe it, to be afterwardes kept of deuotion. Their diſcourſe thē being ended, ſainte Clare fell on her knees before the Pope and beſought him to bleſſe the bread; wherto his holineſſe anſweared: daughter Clare, I will that you bleſſe it your ſelfe, making theron the ſigne of the croſſe. The ſainct therto anſweared, moſt

holy Father, pardon me if you pleaſe: for if I ſhould doe it, I ſhould deſerue ſharpe reprehenſiō in preſuming to giue my benedictiō in preſence of your holineſſe. The Pope againe replyed: well, that no preſumption be imputed vnto you, and that you meritt therby, I command you by holy obedience to bleſſe theſe loaues, making on them the ſigne of the croſſe. This daughter of obedience preſently lifted vp her hand and made the ſigne of the croſſe on the bread, whence enſued an admirable accident, for the croſſe remayned on the bread, wherof part was eaten of deuotion, and the reſt reſerued as a holy relique, which euent filled the Pope with admiration, for which he gaue thanckes to God, then gaue his benediction to ſainte Clare, who receaued it with great humility, and was much comforted withall.
               
               
                  Of many infirmities of the glorious Virgin S. Clare, of her weakneſſe, and how she was viſited by the Protectour.
                  THE XXIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe Virgin ſainte Clare had now forty yeares run the race of the moſt eminent vertue and practiſe of pouerty, and broken the alleblaſter of her body in the moſt ſtrict priſon by faſting and rigours of diſciplines, and by this meane filled the houſe of the holy Church with the moſt precious oyntment of her vertues, wherwith ſhe drew after her an infinite number of ſoules to the ſeruice of IESVS CHRIST: and as ſhe already approached to the recompence of eternall glory, hauing ſupported diuers infirmities and conſumed the forces of her body in her firſt yeares by the rigour of penance, ſhe was alſo in her latter dayes oppreſſed and afflicted with diuers grieuous ſickneſſes. But becauſe in the time of her health, ſhe was in ſuch ſort enriched with the meritt of good worckes, that being ſicke ſhe gained the true richeſſe of the merittes of patience, ſhe yet enioyed the fruites of her vertues that were ripened in afflictions and moleſtations occaſioned by diuerſity of diſeaſes. But the vertue of her patiēce doth euidently appeare in that hauing bin twenty eight yeares together afflicted with diuers diſeaſes, ſhe was neuer heard to vtter the leaſt murmure or complaint: but continually were heard to proceed out of her mouth, pious wordes and thanckesgiuing to almighty God. Now being exceedingly weakened with infirmity and euery moment ſeeming to her the drawing on of the end of her life, it pleaſed our Lord IESVS CHRIST to prolong it till ſhe might be viſited by the eminent Officers of the Romane Church, wherof ſhe was a ſeruant and ſpecial child. For the Pope being yett att Lions, &amp; this S. beginning to be more tormented by her infirmities then ſhe accuſtomed

to be, a ſword of ſorrow through-pearced the ſoule of her beloued daughters. But a virgin, ſeruante of IESVS CHRIST and a very deuout Religious of the Monaſtery of ſaint Paul, and Order of ſaint Benedict, had att that time this viſion following: It ſemed to her that ſhe did viſitt ſainte Clare withall her ſiſters att ſaint Damian, whom ſhe ſaw in a ſorrowfull, yet precious bed, about which they all lamēted expecting her death: and withall ſhe ſaw come to the bolſter of the ſayd bed, a very beautifull woman, who ſayd to them that wept: My daughters, weep not for her that is yet to liue, for ſhe cannot dye til our Lord and all his diſciples doe come. A litle after the Romane Court was att Peruſia, where the encreaſe of ſainte Clares ſickneſſe being diuulged, the Cardinall of Hoſtia haſtened with great dilligence to viſite the eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST, whoſe Father he was by office, Gouernour by ſpeciall ſollicitude, and Foſterer and friend in moſt pure and chaſt amitie; and her he comforted, applying and with his owne handes adminiſtring vnto her the moſt ſacred ſacrament of the Euchariſt, and then made a very deuout ſermon vnto the Religious: ſainte Clare with great humility and in the name of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, beſought him to accept in recommēdation that her family, and all her other poore ſiſters of other Monaſteries: but aboue all ſhe moſt inſtātly beſought him, to obtaine of the Pope and the Colledge of Cardinalls, a priuiledge and confirmation of holy pouerty. Wherto the Cardinall gaue his word, and as a faithfull Protectour of her Religion, &amp; one moſt deuout and affectionat to ſaincte Clare, did afterwardes effect it: For Pope Innocēt the fourth att her moſt inſtāt requeſt, confirmed the rule which the holy Father ſaint Francis had inſtituted for her, as is formerly recorded: of which rule S. Clare had neuer till then other cōfirmation written then that of the ſaid Cardinall, becauſe the Pope ſuppoſing to induce ſainte Clare, not to bind her Religious to ſuch an extreme pouerty, did ſtill deferre to confirme her rule by writing. But Innocent the fourth ſeeing the perſeuerāce and laſt will of ſainte Clare, graunted the ſame vnto her by a bull, the eleuenth and laſt yeare of his raigne, as we haue before recorded. And the yeare being almoſt expired, the Pope came, with his Cardinals from Peruſia to Aſſiſium, wherin the firſt viſion touching the death of the holy virgin was accompliſhed: for the Pope being in his office more then a man, by the aucthority which he hath of IESVS CHRIST on earth, whoſe perſon he repreſenteth in the temple of the Church militant, the Cardinals accompanying his holineſſe, repreſented the diſciples of our Lord IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  
                  How Pope Innocent the fourth viſited S. Clare in her laſt ſicknes, and gaue her abſolution.
                  THE XXIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe diuine prouidence would no longer deferre the accompliſhment of the will of S. Clare, but her Spouſe IESVS CHRIST came to eleuate into his celeſtiall Pallace, his poore eſpouſe and pilgrime on earth, who deſired nothing more, that being deliuered of this mortall body, ſhe might haue the ſight and fruition of her moſt glorious IESVS CHRIST in his kingdome. Now then the members of this virgin being by continuance of her ſicknes as vtterly decayed, there befell her a new weakenes, which being a token that ſhe ſhould in ſhort time be called of God, ſhe alſo vſed it as a ladder to mount to eternall ſaluation. Whervpon the Pope, Innocent the fourth, came to the Monaſtery of ſaint Damian, accompanied with many Cardinals, to viſitt the ſeruant of God, not doubting but ſhe whoſe life he had already approued, was the moſt perfect in ſanctity of all women of his time, and therfore worthy to haue her death honoured by his preſence. His holineſſe then being entred, he went directly to the glorious Virgin, and comming neere to her bed, he tendered her his hand to kiſſe, which fauour ſaincte Clare with exceeding ioy receaued. But beſides that, ſhe with great humility beſought him to aford her his feet to kiſſe. The Pope to content her ſate downe vpon a litle bench, and deuoutly preſented vnto her his Apoſtolicall feet, on which this ſainct reuerently laid her face and mouth, moſt affectionatly kiſſing them, then with the ſerenity of an Angelicall countenance, ſhe demaunded of him remiſsion of all her ſinnes. Wherto the Pope anſweared: would to God my deere ſiſter, I had need of ſuch a pardon: but finally he gaue her the benefitt of abſolutiō, and the gift of his benediction, then left her in peace. She hauing that morning receaued the moſt ſacred communion att the hand of the Prouinciall of the Frere Minors of that prouince, with her handes ioyned and her eyes eleuated towardes heauen, ſhe weeping ſayd to her Religious: My daughters, prayſe almighty God for the benefitt it hath pleaſed him to beſtow on me this day, which is ſuch that the earth and the heauens are not of ſufficiencie to recompence it, ſith this day I haue both receaued the ſame Lord, and am eſteemed worthy to ſee his vicar on earth.
               
               
                  
                  How S. Clare comforted her ſister S. Agnes.
                  THE XXV CHAPTER.
                  THe daughters were all about their mother, without whom they were in ſhort time to remayne orphanes, the cōſideration wherof through-pearced their ſoules with a moſt bitter griefe. The heauines of ſleep, nor hungar could not draw them from the preſence of their mother: the contentment which they receaued in her preſence made them forgett to eat and to ſleep, becauſe all their exerciſe was to weepe and particulerly her moſt deuout ſiſter Agnes, who was expresly come from the Monaſtery which ſhe had newly erected att Florence, to be preſent att her death. Being then in this anguiſh, ſhe tourned towardes her ſiſter, and moſt inſtantly prayed her, not to depriue her of her preſence. Wherto ſainte Clare anſweared: Deere ſiſter, whome I cordially loue, ſith it hath pleaſed God that I depart, be you ioyfull, and weepe no more: for I aſſure you, our Lord will ſhortly come to you, to viſitt you with an exceeding conſolation before your death.
                  
                     Here followeth the teſtament of the holy S. Clare. In nomine Domini Amen.
                     
                     AMongeſt all other benefittes, which we haue receaued of our bountifull benefactour the king of mercies, and doe daily receiue of him: &amp; for which we are moſt boud to praiſe him, one is for our vocatiō: which by how much greater it is, by ſo much more are we bound vnto him: the Apoſtle ſaith: acknowledge your vocatiō. God hath made himſelfe a way, which he hath ſhewed by word and example, &amp; our holy Father S. Francis, a moſt perfect zelatour, and follower of the ſame way hath thaught vs: wherfor my beloued Siſters we ought to marcke the vnmeaſurable benefitt which God hath done vnto vs: amongeſt the reſt that which he hath vouchſafed to worcke in vs through his ſeruāt our Father S. Frācis, not only after our cōuerſion, but alſowhen we were in the captiuity &amp; vanity of the world: for after his conuerſion (not hauing as yet any Brethren or companions) being ro repaire the Church of ſaint Damian, where he was viſited with diuinecōſolation, and cōſtrained wholly to abandon the world, filled with ioy and illumination of the holy Ghoſt, he propheſied of vs that which our lord hath afterwardes fulfilled; ſtanding then on the walles of the ſaid Church he called with a loud voice in the french tongue, vnto ſome poore people dwelling therby ſaying. Come helpe me in this Church of ſainct Damian: for there ſhall

came women of whoſe good life and holy conuerſation, our heauenly Father ſhalbe reioyced in his whole Church. In this may we obſerue the infinite bounty of God towardes vs: who of his aboundāt mercy and charity hath vouchſafed to propheſie thoſe thinges by his ſeruant of our vocatiō and election: &amp; not only of vs hath our holy Father propheſied theſe thinges, but alſo of thoſe who hereafter ſhalbe called vnto that vocation, wherto our Lord hath called vs. With what care of ſoule and body are we then bound to keep the commādements of God, &amp; of our holy Father ſaint Francis, to the end that with the grace of God we may pay the multiplied talent. And our lord hath not only placed vs as an example vnto the ſeculer, but alſo vnto all our Siſters whome he ſhall call vnto our vocation, that we may be vnto thoſe who conuerſe in the world a mirrour and example. For our Lord God hath called vs vnto ſo great thinges, that they may take example of vs, who are giuen vnto others for an example, for which we are bound greatly to bleſſe &amp; the more ought we for this to be ſtrēgthened in our lord to doe well: wherfore if we liue according to the forme aboue mentioned, we ſhall leaue good example vnto thoſe which follow vs, &amp; with ſhort paine we ſhall receiue the reward of euerlaſting life. After that our heauenly Father vouchſafed through his great mercy and grace to illuminate my hart in ſuch ſort that by the example and touching of our holy Father S. Francis, I began to doe penance: a litle after my conuerſion, I, with a few Siſters whome our Lord gaue me▪ haue willingly promiſed vnto him obedience, like as our lord through the light of his grace inſpired vnto vs by meanes of his merueillous life and holy doctrine. Saint Francis then marcking that we were tender and fraile according to the body, yet neuertheleſſe nothing diſmayed with any neceſsity, pouerty, paine, tribulation, or contempt of the world, but that we eſteemed all thoſe thingees as great pleaſure, euen as he had experienced by the example of his Brethren: he reioyced in our lord, and with great charity inclining towardes vs, he obliged himſelfe &amp; his Brethren to haue alwayes ouer vs a ſpeciall and diligent care. We alſo by the will of God &amp; of our holy Father ſaint Frācis, repaired to the Church of ſaint Damiā there to dwell, a litle after which time, our lord through his great mercy &amp; grace multiplyed vs: and then was fulfilled that which our lord had foretold by his ſeruant: for we had dwelt before in an other place: litle after that, he wrote vnto vs this forme of life, and principally that we ſhould perſeuer in this pouerty; and it was not ſufficient vnto him to haue admoniſhed vs therunto in his life, by many ſermons &amp; aduertiſemētes, to the end he might moue vs to the loue and obſeruance of this moſt holy pouerty: but he hath alſo giuen vs many writinges, that after his death we ſhould not fall from the ſame holy pouertye, according to the example

of the Sonne of God, who liuing in this world did neuer leaue the ſame: which holy pouerty, our holy Father ſaint Francis, and his Brethrē did honour and obſerue during his life; Wherfore, I Clare, ſeruant and handmayd of Chriſt, and of the poore Siſters of ſaint Damian, although vnworthy, and the litle plant of our holy Father ſaint Francis, conſidering this with my other Siſters, as alſo the highnes of our profeſsion, made vnto ſuch a worthy Father, and the frailty of vs and others, which we feare after the death of our holy Father, who next vnto God was our only piller, and comfort: againe and againe we binde our ſelues vnto the holy lady pouerty: to the end that the Siſters who are, or ſhall come after my death, may by no meanes decline from the ſame.
                     This Pouerty I haue alwayes bin carefull (with the grace of God) to obſerue, and to cauſe it to be obſerued: and for more ſurety of the ſame, I haue made my Profeſsion therof vnto our holy Father Pope Innocent the fourth in whoſe time we began, and haue confirmed it by his ſucceſſours: that by no meanes in no time, we ſhould decline from this holy Pouerty, which we haue vowed vnto God and vnto ſaint Francis. Wherfore I bending the knee both of myne inward and outward man: in all humility doe commend vnto the church of Rome, to our holy Father the Pope, and eſpecially vnto the Cardinall, to whoſe protection, together wit the Franciſcans we are committed, that for the loue of God, who was layd in the cribbe, liued poorly in this world, and dyed poorly on the croſſe, they will keepe the litle flock which God the Father hath gayned in his church, through the wordes and examples of our holy Father ſaint Francis: cauſing it to follow the humility and pouerty of his deerly beloued Sonne, the Father of wiſdome, and of his holy mother, and that they will cauſe the holy pouerty to be obſerued which we haue promiſed vnto God and to ſainct Francis; as alſo ſtrengthen thē for to obſerue the ſame. And like as God gaue vnto vs our Father ſaint Francis, for our founder and helper in the ſeruice of God and of thoſe thinges which we haue vowed vnto God and vnto him to obſerue; and as he was carefull whiles he liued to exerciſe vs his plantes, by word &amp; examples: ſo I commend and leaue my Siſters, who already are, as alſo thoſe who hereafter ſhall be vnto the ſucceſſours of ſaint Francis, and to the whole religion: that they wilbe alwayes an aſsiſtance vnto vs to profitt from better to better, to ſerue God, and to accompliſh and obſerue this holy pouerty. If it ſhould happen att any time that the ſaid ſiſters ſhould leaue their country or citty to goe vnto an other, they are firmely bound after my death in what place ſoeuer they are, to obſerue the holy pouerty, which they haue vowed vnto God and to ſaint Francis.
                     Thoſe which ſhall be in office as alſo the other ſiſters, ſhalbe carefull not to receiue more land then extreme neceſsity doth require, as a garden

for hearbes vnto their neceſsity. And if for the defence or vſe of the cloyſter, it weere needfull to haue more land, they ſhall take but only to ſupply the neceſsity, and in this lād they may neither plough nor ſowe. I admoniſh you all my Siſters, who are &amp; ſhall be, that you labour to follow the way of ſimplicity, humility, pouerty, and alſo the modeſty of holy conuerſation, as we in the beginning of our conuerſion, haue bin taught of Chriſt, and of our holy Father ſaint Francis through which (not through our meritt) but through the mercy of the liberall giuer; the Father of mercies hath ſpread abroad the ſauour of our good name, as well vnto thoſe who are far off, as to ſuch as are neere.
                     And for the charity of our Lord IESVS lett thē keepe the vniō of loue. The charity which you haue interiourly, ſhew it exteriourly by worckes, to the end that through your exāple, the ſiſters who are called vnto your profeſsion, may encreaſe in the loue of God, &amp; mutuall charity. Alſo I pray all thoſe who ſhalbe choſen in the offices of the ſiſters that they ſtudy to excell the others, rather in vertue and modeſt conuerſation, then in their office: to the end that by their example, the Siſters that were called vnto the religion before them, be moued to obey them, not only in reſpect of their office, but for loue. The Abbeſſe muſt be carefull &amp; diſcreet towardes her Siſters, as a good mother towardes her children. She muſt alſo haue a prouident care of euery one according to their neceſsity, of the almoſe which it ſhall pleaſe God to ſend her. She muſt withall be ſo ſweet and indifferent vnto all, that the ſiſters may with out feare or doubt, declare vnto her their neceſsity, and that they confidently haue recourſe vnto her, when the Abbeſſe and the Siſters ſhall thincke it to be neceſſary. The Siſters that are ſubiect, lett them remember that for the loue of God they haue renounced their owne willes, wherfore I will that they obey their mother, as they of their one accord promiſed vnto God to doe: to the end that their mother ſeeing the humility, charity, &amp; vnion which they haue vnto each other, may eaſily beare the chardge, with the office ſheſuſtaineth: and becauſe it is heauy &amp; bitter they muſt through their holy conuerſatiō, turne it into ſweetnes. And becauſe the way is narrow &amp; the gate ſtreight, which leadeth vnto life, &amp; few there are that walke in it, and few that perſeuer therin: bleſſed are they that haue receiued the grace to walke in it, and to perſeuer vnto the end: lett vs therfore be carefull, if we be entred in the way of our lord, that by out fault and negligence we doe not fall from the ſame: to the end that we committ not that iniury vnto our lord, to this bleſſed mother the glorious Virgin Mary, to our holy Father ſainct Francis, and to the triumphant and militant church: for it is written, accurſed are they who decline from your commandement. For to obtaine this grace, I bend my knee vnto the heauenly Father through the merittes of lord IESVS,

and of his bleſſed mother; of our holy Father ſaint Francis, and of all the Sainctes: that it well pleaſe him of his diuine Maieſtie, who hath giuen a good beginning, to graunt grace alſo, that it may augment and perſeuer euen vntill death. Deerly beloued Siſters, preſent and to come, to the end that you may the better perſeuer in your vocation; I leaue vnto you this writing, and in token of our Lordes benediction and of the benedictiction of our holy Father ſaint Francis, and of me your mother and ſeruant.
                     The end of the testament of the glorious Virgin ſaincte Clare.
                  
                  
                     Here enſueth S. Clares Benediction vnto her Siſters, preſent and to come.
                     IN the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt. Amen. My deerly beloued Siſters, our lord giue you his holy benedictiō, and behold you with his holy eye of mercy, giuing you his peace: as alſo to all thoſe that ſhall enter and perſeuer in this our Colledge and monaſtery, and vnto all other of the Order, who ſhall perſeuer vnto the end in this holy pouerty: I Clare ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST, and litle plante of our holy Father S. Francis: your mother &amp; Siſter, though vnworthy, doe beſeech our lord IESVS CHRIST, that by the interceſsion of his moſt holy mother, of the holy Archangell S. Michaell, and of all the holy Angels, of our holy Father S. Francis, and of al the holy Saintes, that it wil pleaſe him to giue and confirme vnto you this benediction in heauen, and in earth by multiplying in you his holy grace: and in heauen by eleuating you into the eternall glory with his ſaintes. And I giue you my benediction in my life, and after my death, in all that I am able, and more then I am able: Withall the bleſsinges, wherwith the Father of mercies hath or ſhall bleſſe his ſpirituall children, both in heauē and earth: or that the ſpirituall mother doth, or ſhalbe able to bleſſe her ſpirituall chirldren. Amen. Be alwayes louers of God, of your ſoule and of your Siſters, and be alwayes carefull to keepe that, which you haue vowed to God. Our lord be alwayes with you, and you with him. Amē.
                  
               
               
                  Of the death of the bleſſed Virgin S. Clare, and of a viſion which one of her Religious ſaw.
                  THE XXVI. CHAPTER.
                  THe holy virgin, and ſeruant of IES. CH. was many dayes towardes the end of her life afflicted with diuers diſeaſes. The faith &amp; deuotiō which att that time each one boare her, exceedingly encreaſed, yea ſo

far foorth as ſhe was honoured as a S. being ordinarily viſited by Cardinals, Biſhoppes, and other Prelates. But, which is more admirable to heare, hauing bin ſeauenteen dayes without force to receaue any ſuſtenāce that was preſented vnto her, ſhe was neuertheles ſo fortified of God and encouraged of his diuine Maieſty, that ſhe exhorted all thoſe that would comfort her to be prompt in the ſeruice of God. A Religious mā intending to comfort her and to perſuade her to haue patience in ſo grieuous a ſickneſſe that procured her ſo much torment, ſhe with a ſmiling countenance &amp; cleare voyce anſweared him: Brother, ſince the time that I knew the grace of my God, by meanes of his ſeruant ſaint Francis, no paine hath bin troubleſome vnto me, no penance hath ſeemed difficult, nor no ſickneſſe irckſome.
                  And as almighty God approached neere vnto her, &amp; her ſoule being as it were att the dore to goe forth, the bleſſed virgin would haue the moſt pious and ſpirituall Frere Minors to be preſent, to diſcourſe vnto her of the paſsiō of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and by their pious wordes to enflame her more in the loue of God. Wherfore ſome of them who were vnto her true Brethren, in our Redeemer CHRIST IESVS were preſent, and amōg others Br. Iuniperus, the familier of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, who often vttered vnto her, ſuch fiery and enflamed wordes of the omnipotēt God, that ſhe by his preſēce being filled with an extreme ioy, one day demaunded of him, if he then knew nothing new of almighty God: whervpon Br. Iuniperus opening his mouth to anſweare her, there iſſued out of the fourniſe of his enflamed hart, infinite ſparckes of ſuch ſublime wordes, that this holy virgin receaued therof much conſolation. Finally turning her Angelicall face towards her deere and beloued daughters and ſiſters there preſent, bitterly weeping, ſhe recommended vnto them the pouerty of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST in this her laſt paſſadge, prayſing and thancking God, for the infinite benefittes which they had receaued of his diuine Maieſty, which ſhe particulerly recounted vnto them; then ſhe gaue them all her benediction, &amp; alſo to all the Religious of her Monaſtery preſent &amp; abſent, and to all thoſe that ſhould enter into her Order. There were preſent two companions of ſaint Frācis, Br. Angelus, who though much afflicted did yet comfort the others, and the right ſimple Br. Leo, who ceaſed not to kiſſe the bed of the holy virgin, that was leuing the world, who was lamēted of her daughters becauſe they wer left orphanes &amp; were no more in this life to ſee their moſt holy mother, and therfore they accōpanyed her ſoule vnto heauen with abōdance of teares, without power to admit any other conſolation then to deſire to goe with her: wherwith being ſo afflicted, they could not without difficulty forbeare with their nailes to rent their faces; but it not being permitted them to diſchardge thēſelues

of ſuch greife exteriourly, it did enflame in them a more burning fire within: For thoſe eſpouſes of IESVS CHRIST were ſufficiently morified by the rigour of Religion, albeit the force of greife did conſtraine thē to caſt forth loud cryes and ſighes, and to power out riuers of teares. The holy virgin att lenght being turned towardes thē, begā very ſweetly to ſay vnto her ſoule, goe my ſoule, goe ſorth ſecurely; thou haſt an aſſured guide to performe this voyage: for he that is they Creatour, hath ſanctified thee, &amp; hath alwayes conſerued thee, affecting thee with a tender loue, equall with that of a mother towardes her child. And thou my God, be prayſed for hauing created me. A Religious ſiſter asking her what ſhe meant therby: ſhe anſweared: I ſpeake to my bleſſed ſoule. Her moſt glorious Spouſe IESVS CHRIST was not far from her, &amp; attended for her. Thē tourning to one of her Religious, ſhe ſayd: Doe you not ſee my daughter, the king of glory whome I ſee? Almighty God alſo layd his hand on an other Religious, who ſaw with her corporall eyes thorough the teares that diſtilled from them, a glorious viſion; ſhe being pearced thorough with the dart of ſorrow, caſt her eyes towardes the gate of the houſe, and ſaw enter a great proceſsion of virgins richly cloathed in white, hauing each one a croune of gold on their head: but one of them appeared more beautifull, ſumptuous and glittering thē the reſt: For ſhe had on her head an imperiall crowne, garniſhed with precious ſtones, out of whoſe countenāce proceeded a light ſo ſhining that it cō
                     uerted the obſcurity of the night into cleare and bright day: It was with out doubt the glorious Virgin Mary, Queen of virgins, who came to the bed of the eſpouſe of her ſonne, to whome enclining ſhe graciously embraced her, and incontinently ſhe was couered and the bed alſo by the other virgins with an extreme ſumptuous mantell. So the day following, which was the eleuenth of Auguſt, this holy ſoule aſcended to heauen, there to be crowned with perpetuall glory. Happy was her departure out of this miſerable life, ſith it was her entry into that of eternall felicitie. For the faſtes which this S. performed in this exile, ſhe is now ioyfull and had her fill att the magnificall table of the cittizens of heauē: and for the humility and baſeneſſe of her habite, ſhe is now gloriously attired with the glory of Paradiſe. The continuall ſighes and deſires which ſhe had for the preſence and loue of her deerly beloued Spouſe, are accompliſhed by the bleſſed viſion of God face to face, and by the aſſured fruition of the ſoueraigne good: leauing the way open to the example of ſanctity, that we blinded, and miſerable mortall creatures, reiecting theſe ſhort, falſe and deceiptfull pleaſures of this world, may purchaſe the permanent, true and aſſured that indure eternally.
               
               
                  
                  Of the honorable obſequies that were performed for S. Clare.
                  THE XXVII. CHAPTER.
                  WHiles the ſoule of S. Clare departed this life, the report of her deceaſſe was incontinently diuulged through Aſsiſium: whence both men and women in ſuch abondance ſpeedily flocked to the Monaſtery, that none ſeemed to be left in the citty. Each one preſently eſteemed her a ſainct, and called her the eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST, accompayning their diſcourſes with great abondance of teares of deuotion. The officers of iuſtice repayred thither accompanyed with many warlike Champions and a great nomber of armed men, which that night guarded the monaſtery, for feare that precious treaſure might be bereaued them. The night following, the Pope with all his Court came thither, accompayned by all the neighbour people.
                  The Religious men of S. Damiā being ready to begin the office of the dead, the Pope would haue to be ſayd the office of the holy virgins, wherin he would haue canonized her before her buryall: But the Cardinall of Hoſtia hauing demonſtrated vnto him that it was fitt in this affaire to proceed with more humane prudence, the Pope permitted the ſayd Religious ſolemnly to proceed in the office of the dead according to the cuſtome.
                  The ſaid Cardinall hauing taken for his text, Vanitas vanitatum &amp; omnia vanitas, made a very worthy and deuout ſermon to manifeſt the vanity of thinges appertayning only to this world, where he exceedingly exalted that moſt eminent Contemptrice of vanityes: which ended, all the Cardinals and other Prelates accompanied this holy body with an exemplar deuotion. All the funeralles being very ſolemnly accompliſhed, the cittizens of Aſsiſium thincking it not ſecure that this precious treaſure ſhould remayne ſo farre out of their citty, they cauſed this holy body with exceeding great pomp to be tranſported, ſinging pſalmes and hymnes with the ſound &amp; melody of diuers muſicall inſtrumentes, and in a very ſolemne proceſsion they carryed it into the Church of ſainct George within their citty, where the body of ſainct Francis had formerly bin repoſed. And it was very reaſonnable that he who in his life, had giuen a patterne of the way of life vnto this holy virgin, ſhould as is were prophetically prepare her a place of ſepulture▪ There was then a great repaire and confluence of people frō diuers citties, townes, and villages vnto Aſsiſium, to thanck IESVS CHRIST, and to pray, vnto this bleſſed creature, proclayming,

this virgin to be really a ſainct, and glorious, who now liueth in Paradiſe with the Angels, hauing bin already ſo much honoured of men on earth. O bleſſed virgin, pray now to God for vs, and gaine our ſoules to IESVS CHRIST in heauen, as thou haſt conuerted and gayned ſo many, liuing on earth. The holy virgin paſſed this tranſitory life to the other of reſt, the yeare of grace, 1253. the twelfth of Auguſt, forty yeares after her perfect vocation to God, and the 60. yeare of her age. She was enterred the 12. of Auguſt, on which day her feaſt is ſolemniſed att Aſsiſium, and ouer all the holy Romane Church.
               
               
                  Of the miracles wrought by the merittes of S. Clare, and first of poſſeſſed perſonnes that haue bin deliuered.
                  THE XXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe cheefeſt marckes that ſainctes can haue, and the worthieſt teſtimonies of faith and reuerence, are ſanctity of life, and the perfection of good worckes: for ſainct Iohn Baptiſt, wrought no miracles during his life, and yet they that haue wrought many, ſhall not be eſteemed more holy then he. And therfore the notable renowne of the religious life of ſaincte Clare, might ſuffice to make her appeare ſuch as ſhe is, if the tepedity, coldnes, and remiſſneſſe of the world, and partly alſo deuotion did not otherwiſe require. But ſith this holy virgin was not only in her life time by her merittes ſwallowed vp in the depth of diuine illumination, but was alſo after her death of merueilous ſplendour ouer all the world by the light of her miracles; and as the moſt pure verity hath cauſed the recording of many of her miracles, that they remayne as teſtimony, memory and denunciation of her ſanctity: therfore alſo the multitude of them enforce the rehearſall of ſome, that they may be generally diuulged and knowne.
                  A child called Iames, ſeeming not ſo ſick as poſſeſſed, in regard that ſometimes he caſt himſelfe into the fire, or into the riuer, fell rudely on the ground, and with ſuch fury did bite the ſtones that he brake his teeth withall, forced bloud out of his head, and wreſted his mouth moſt ſtrangely, yea ſometimes would ſeeme a mōſtrer, ſo dubling and folding his members, as his feet would be on his necke. He was ordinarily twice in the day afflicted with the like tormentes, in ſuch ſort that two perſonnes ſufficed not to reſtraine him from tearing of his cloathes, yea there was great difficulty to keep him from murdering himſelfe. Many Phiſitians hauing in vaine laboured to cure him, att length his Father named Guidalot had recourſe to the merittes of S. Clare, affectionatly ſaying: O holy virgin honoured of the world, to

thee I adreſſe my ſelf, to beſeech thee to obtaine of God my ſōnes health. Then ful of cōfidence he conducted him to the ſepulchre of this ſainct, and layd him therevpon, and he preſently miraculously obtayned the fauour he deſired, his ſonne being perfectly cured of all his infirmities, and was neuer troubled after.
                  Alexandrina of the towne of Frata, neere to Peruſia, was poſſeſſed &amp; tormented with an abhominable deuill, to whoſe power ſhe was ſo left that he made her fly as a byrd to the topp of a rock neere to the riuer of Tiber, then made her deſcend to a branch of a tree that did hang over the ſayd riuer, then to hang on that branch, there playing her idle pranckes. This woman had halfe her body vtterly benummed, for which the Phiſitians could find no remedy: Att lenght ſhe came with great deuotion to the ſhrine of ſaincte Clare, and inuocating her merittes ſhe was cured of all her afflictions: for ſhe had alſo the gout in her left hand, and her body halfe paraliticall was cured, and withall ſhe was entierly freed of the oppreſsion and ſeruitude of the deuill

                  THE XXIX. CHAPTER.
                  A French youth, goeing to Rome in company of others his country men, fell ſick and lay by the way, and by the force of his infirmity loſt his ſence and ſpeech, and his body became deformed as it were a monſter, then became he ſo furious that he could not be held, ſo that he ſeemed ready to dye; which ſpectacle did not only moue his companions to compaſsion, but did alſo exceedingly terrifie them: and therfore they bound him to a biere and carryed him to the Church of ſaincte Clare, where hauing placed him before her ſepulcher, they applyed them all to prayers, inuocating the helpe of God and of the S. who made ſuch interceſsion for the yong man, that he was in an inſtant entierly cured.
                  A man of the citty of Spoletum, called Valentin, was exceedingly afflicted with the falling ſickneſſe, in which he fell ſix times a day in whatſoeuer place he was, and beſides he had one foot ſo wreſted awry that he was vtterly lamed: he was brought on an aſſe to the ſepulcher of S. Clare, where hauing remayned two dayes and three nightes, the third day attempting to moue his lame foot, and none being neere him, he made ſuch a noyſe, that being heard by ſome a farre off, they ſeemed to

heare the kreaking of a peice of dry wood, and the man was inſtantly cured of both the one and the other his ſayd diſeaſes.
                  The ſonne of a woman of Spoletum, called Iames of twelue yeares old, beingblind, could not goe without a guid: being once forſaken by him that conducted him, he fell into a pitt, brake one of his armes, and hurt his head. The night following ſleeping by the bridge of Varue, a woman appeared vnto him, and ſayd: Iames, if thou come to me to Aſsiſium I will cure thee. Ariſing early in the morning, he much admired att the viſion, which he recounted vnto two other blind men, who anſweared him: Brother, we haue lately heard of a Lady that is dead in the citty of Aſsiſium, att whoſe ſepulcher God worcketh by her merittes great miracles: which the blinde youth hauing heard, he left the two other blind men, and wiht a ſtrong confidence haſtened to Aſsiſium: in the way he lodged att Spoletum, where in the night he had the ſame viſion, which encreaſed his hope of recouering his ſight, and made him haſten in time to arriue to the church of ſaincte Clare. But he found it ſo filled with worldly people, that he could not enter: which exceedingly troubled him. But ſeeing no remedy, he reſted att the dore, and there remayned till the euening, where this poore blind youth being weary by his iorney, and afflicted for that he could not enter into the church, ſetled himſeſfe the beſt he could, to reſt vpon the ground, leaning his head againſt a great ſtone, and ſo slept: and preſently the third time heard the ſayd voice, ſpeaking: Iames, God will doe thee good, if thou canſt enter: and incontinently awaking out of that sleep, he began to cry and begge of the people with abondance of teares, to permitt him to enter, which hauing a long time continued, they gaue him place: and hauing diſcloathed himſelfe, putting his girdle about his neck, he went to the ſepulcher of the ſainct, before which with great reuerence and humility he fell on his 'knees, and hauing perſiſted ſometime in prayer, beſeeching ſaincte Clare to intercede for him, he fell into a gentle slumber, wherin ſaincte Clare appeared vnto him and ſayd: Ariſe Iames, for thou art already cured: and being awaked and rayſed on his feet, the defect of his ſight left him, and by the vertues and merittes of this Sainct he clearly ſaw, for which he glorifyed God, and gaue him thanckes for ſo admirable a worcke, exhorting all preſent to doe the like, and to prayſe our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, in his holy ſeruant.
               
               
                  
                  Of the lame and paralitiques cured by ſaincte Clare.
                  THE XXX. CHAPTER.
                  A Cittiſen of Peruſia called Iohn Martin de Buony, wēt one time with many other Cittiſens out of the citty to fight againſt their ennemies of Tullinium: the skirmiſh being ended, Iohn found his hand exceedingly hurt with the blow of a flint ſtone, and the bone being broken, he was therby maymed: hauing bin att extreme coſte for the cure therof, yet without any remedy, but ſtill enforced to carry his arme in a ſcarfe, he alwayes complayned therof as of a deſperat may me, and asked counſel about cutting off his hand, but hauing one day heard ſpeech of merueillous matters wrought by almighty God att the interceſsion of ſainte Clare, he with a ſtrong faith vowed to goe to her ſepulcher, whither arriuing he very deuoutly and reuerently preſented her a hand of wax, then fell on his knees and made his feruent prayers to God, that it would pleaſe his diuine Maieſty, by the merittes of that holy virgin to cure him. The ſucceſſe was admirable, for before this gentleman aroſe, he felt his hand entierly cured, for which he gaue thanckes to God and to the Saint.
                  A yong man of Caſtrouitoly, called Petronius, was ſo conſumed with a diſeaſe which had for three yeares continually afflicted him, that he ſeemed to be already withered and corrupted, yea he was therby brought to ſuch weakeneſſe, that in goeing he ſtooped with his face as it were on the ground, and found great difficulty to walke, though with a ſtaffe in his hand to ſupport him. His Father hauing already bin exceedingly chardged about his cure, continued yet in reſolution to employ the reſidue of his ſubſtance, out of his vehement deſire to ſee his ſonne cured. But the Phiſitions hauing aſſured him that there was no hope of cure by humane art, he had recourſe to the new Sainct: of whoſe vertue hauing heard much report, he cauſed his ſonne to be carryed where the Reliques of ſaincte Clare repoſed. And hauing made his prayers by her ſepulcher, he recouered his former health, and miraculously aroſe ſound and ſtraight as if he had neuer endured infirmity, yea he ran, leapt, and prayſed God and ſaincte Clare, inducing all preſent to haue greater faith and deuotion towardesThe giftes of graces are diſtinct. her.
                  In the towne of ſainct Quiric, within the dioceſſe of Aſsiſium, a child of ten yeares old, hauing bin borne lame, went ſo pittifully and painfully, that if he chanced to fal to the groūd, he could not riſe againe but with extreme difficulty. His Mother had many times recommended

him to S. Francis, yet found he no redreſſe: but vnderſtanding afterward that the virgin ſainte Clare was very famous for infinite miracles which by her merittes were wrought att her ſepulcher, ſhe cauſed her ſonne to be carryed thither, and incontinently after he had bin there, his bones were ſetled in their places, and his members were cured: that which ſainct Francis, entreated by deuout prayers would not graunt, he referred to be obtayned and impetrated by the merittes of his diſciple ſaincte Clare.
                  A Cittiſen of Augubia, called Iames le Franch, had a ſonne of fiue yeares old ſo lame that he could not goe, which he very impatiently ſupported, it ſeeming to him that the torment of his child was a reproch vnto his honour and family. When this child was on the ground, he would wallow and creep in the duſt in that ſort to goe: and if he would ſtay himſelfe againſt any thing to ariſe, he could not: for nature had giuen him only a deſire, but no force and ability thervnto. But his Father and mother conſulted to make a vow for him, and to offer him to the merittes of ſainte Clare, to whome they promiſed, that being cured, he ſhould be called hers. The vow being made, the eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST cured this child, who began ſo well to goe, that without any helpe he went to the ſepulcher of the ſayd ſainct.
                  A woman of Caſtel Menany, called Plenaria, had bin long time benummed, in ſuch ſort as ſhe could not goe without a ſtaffe: but cauſing herſelfe to be carryed to the ſepulcher of S. Clare, and hauing there deuoutly offered her prayers, ſhe the day following obtayned what ſhe there with faith demaunded. So ſhe retourned home on her owne feet, who came thither ſupported by the feet of others.
                  A woman of Peruſia had a ſwelling on her cheeke which tormented her a long time, and beſides had al ouer her body many ring wormes &amp; tettars, ſhe had alſo her neck greater then her head. And often thincking of S. Clare, ſhe one day went to her church, where withgreat deuotion and a true faith ſhe made her prayers: and continuing by her ſepulcher till euen within night, ſhe fell into a great ſweat, wherby the ſwelling began to wax dry and to ſhrinck, and ſo by litle and litle ſhe was ſo perfectly cured, that there remayned no ſhew of ſcarre.
               
               
                  How two children were by ſaincle Clare reſcued and preſerued from the rage of wolues.

                     ē proy there on humā fleſh. There dwelt a woman

called Bonna, on the Mount Galien, within the dioceſſe of Aſsiſium, who hauing two children, had ſcarce ended her lamentations for the one which the wolues had deuoured, but, whiles ſhe was buſy in her houſe they carryed away the other. The wolfe carryed her child to the top of the mountayne, &amp; grapled it by the throat when a labourer in the vineyardes hearing the pittifull cry of the child, called the mother, and admoniſhed her to haue care of her ſonne, in regard he heard a crying voice like to his. The woman not finding her ſonne, preſently beleeued that the wolfe had ſeaſed on him, and therfore began to rayſe her lamentation towardes heauen, deuoutly inuocating the helpe of S. Clare in theſe tearmes: O bleſſed ſaincte Clare, haue compaſsion on me miſerable woman, and reſtore me my child. Alas heare if thou pleaſe the prayers of an infortunate mother! permitt me not to continue in this ſo rigorous deſolation. Whiles this poore woman ſo recommended her diſtreſſe to ſaincte Clare, her neighbours fourniſhed with weapons haſtened after the rauening wolfe, and comming to the top of the ſayd mountaine, they found that he had left the child wounded in the throat, whoſe woundes a dogge was licking. And ſo the child was ſafely recouered by the merittes of ſaincte Clare, who was inuocated by his mother, to whome he was brought, and was incontinently reſtored to perfect health.
                  A litle girle of the towne of Canary, being about noone abroad in the ayre where ſhe did ſome ſeruice to an other woman, there came a wolfe, which being taken by the girle but for a dogge, he lept on her neck &amp; tooke hold of her head. The other woman and the mother of the girle there preſent, ran after, and cryed for helpe, inuocating ſainte Clare: and it was admirable to heare, that the child being in the teeth of the wolfe reprehended him, ſaying: Thou theefe, how canſt thou carry me farther I being recommended to that holy virgin? The wolfe as daunted with thoſe wordes, gently ſett the girle on the ground, and as a theefe found and taken in the fact, he fled: and the girle retourned without any hurt vnto her mother.
               
               
                  How diuers were deliuered from drowning and danger of ſea, hauing i

                     uocated S. Clare.
                  THE XXXII. CHAPTER.
                  AShippe fraught with many perſonnes departing out of the port of Peruſia, for the ile of Sardinie, the firſt night there aroſe ſuch a terrible tempeſt, that the force therof leaked the bottome of the veſſell: which made apparent to all therein, that they were in

moſt euident perill of ſhipwrack: wherfore they began to inuocate the Queene of heauen, and many other ſainctes to aſsiſt them. Att length perceiuing no apparence of their liues ſafety, they addreſſed themſelues to ſaincte Clare, and vowed to her, that if by her interceſsion they were deliuered, they would goe all naked to their very ſhirtes, with their girdle about their necks, to viſitt her ſacred reliques att Aſſiſium, carrying each a wax light of two poundes in their handes. This vow being made, they ſaw three great lightes diſcend from heauen, the one wherof ſetled on the forepart of the ſhipp, an other on the poupe, and the third on the pumpe, by the vertue wherof the leakes where the water entred did cloſe, and the ſea became ſo quiet and calme, that with a gracious wind the veſſell was accompanied and conducted by the ſaid lightes to the part of Areſtan, whither being arriued and landed, &amp; the marchandiſe all ſafely putt on ſhoare, the ſayd lightes vaniſhed, and (which was admirable) the ſhippe preſently ſunk and was caſt away. They that had gone out of her acknowledging the miracle, att their retourne to Piſa deuoutly accompliſhed their vow, yelding infinite thanckes to almighty God, and to the virgin ſainte Clare, for the great benefitt receaued by her interceſsion.
               
               
                  How S. Clare was canonized by Pope Alexander the fourth.
                  THE XXXIII. CHAPTER.
                  POpe Innocent the fourth liued ſo litle time after the death of ſainte Clare that he cold not canonize her. The holy ſiege hauing bin two yeares vacant, Alexander the fourth was choſen Pope, who being exceedingly deuoted and a friend to piety, protectour of Religious, hauing heard true relation both of the miracles which our Lord IESVS CHRIST wrought, for the glory of his holy ſeruant, and of the renowme of her vertue, which daily more and more diuulged it ſelfe in the Church: knowing alſo that her canonization was generally deſired, his holineſſe being alſo induced by the aſſurance of ſo many miracles, therfore begā to treat in the Conſiſtory of her canonizatiō. Wherin to proceed more maturely, there were elected prudent and vertuous men to examine the ſayd miracles and the irreprehenſible life of the ſainct. Which being done, and this holy virgin being found and proued to haue bin in her life an vnſpotted mirrour of all vertues, and to haue bin ennobled of almighty God after her death by true and approued miracles, the day of her Canonization was appointed, when were preſent with his Holineſſe many Cardinals, Archbiſhoppes, Biſhoppes, other Prelates, and a great number of Prieſtes and Religious, with infinite

noblemen, gentlemen and others each in their degree and quality, before whome the Pope propoſed this ſacred affaire, demaunding the opinion of the Prelates: who with one accord gaue conſent, and affectionatly beſought the ſaid ſainct might be canonized in the Church, as IESVS CHRIST had glorified her in heauen. In this ſort then, three yeares after her happy deceaſe, Pope Alexander cauſed her ſolemnely to be enrollod in the Catalogue of Sainctes, ordayning her feaſt to be celebrated with ſolemnity in the Church, the 12. of Auguſt. This Canonization was performed the yeare of grace 1255. and the firſt of the raigne of the Pope, to the praiſe and glory of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST.
                  
                     The life of ſaincte Agnes ſister to ſaincte Clare.

                  THE XXXIIII. CHAPTER.
                  THe virgin and eſpouſe of our Redeemer IES. CH. Agnes true ſiſter &amp; companion of S. Clare, as well in bloud as in vertue and Religion, perſeuered and perſiſted in notable ſanctity of life in the Monaſtery of ſainct Damian, and from the time of her entrance into Religion euen to her death, ſhe alwayes woare a very rough haircloth next her tender fleſh. Her ordinary refection was almoſt alwayes bread and water; ſhe was naturally very pittifull to euery one. Sainct Francis finding this virgin to haue obtayned of God, by meane and aſsiſtance of her ſiſter, a worthy perfection, he ſent her to Florence there to found a new Monaſtery of poore ſiſters called Mount Celi, wherof ſainct Francis made her Abbeſſe. This holy virgin induced many ſoules to abandon the world to ſerue IESVS CHRIST, which ſhe did by meane of her pious conuerſation and ſanctity of life, by holy diſcourſes and wordes of God, that ſweetly flowed out of her mouth: and as a perfect Contemptrice of tranſitory thinges and follower of IESVS CHRIST, ſhe planted in this Monaſtery (conformably to the deſire of the holy Father ſainct Francis and of ſaincte Cla

                  THE XXXV. CHAPTER.
                  TO the venerable and beloued Mother in our Lord CHRST IESVS Clare, and to all her Couent, humble ſiſter Agnes, the leaſt of the diſciples of IESVS CHRIST and of yours recommendeth herſelfe vnto you all, and proſtrate att your feet doth yeld you all ſubmiſsion and deuotion, wiſhing vnto you what is moſt precious from the moſt high king of kinges. To the end that all nature which hath bin created of God, doe acknowledge it ſelfe to be ſuch, as none can perſiſt of it ſelfe in its owne eſſence, the diuine prouidence moſt prudently permitteth that when any one eſteemeth himſelfe to be in proſperity, then is he drowned and plunged in aduerſities. This I tell you (my moſt deere Mother) that you may know what affliction and extreme heauines poſſeſſeth my ſpiritt, being ſo tormented that hardly can I ſpeake: and this becauſe I am corporally ſeparated from you and my holy ſiſters, with whome I hoped to haue happely liued and dyed in this world. So farre is this my griefe from slacking, that it continually encreaſeth: which as it had a beginning, ſo doe I beleeue it will finde no end in this world. For it is ſo continuall and familier vnto me, that it will neuer forſake me. I was perſuaded that life and death ſhould be a like, without power of any ſeparation on earth, amongeſt them who haue one ſame conuerſation and life in heauen, and muſt haue one ſame ſepulture, them I ſay, who one ſame and equall naturall profeſsion, and one ſame loue hath made ſiſters. But as far as I can ſee, being abandoned and afflicted on eache ſide, I am much miſtaken. O my holy ſiſters! I beſeech you to be reciprocally grieued with me, and lett vs weepe together, I being aſſured that you ſhall neuer experience any doulour comparable to that which I now feele, in being ſeparated from them with whome IESVS CHRIST had conioyned me. This griefe tormenteth me inceſſantly, this fire burneth my hart continually, ſo that being on each ſide afflicted, I know what to thincke, neither doth any hope remayne but to be aſsiſted by your prayers, that Almighty God eaſing this affliction, may make it tollerable vnto me.

O my moſt gracious mother! what ſhall I doe and what ſhall I ſay? ſith I know not that euer I ſhall ſee you more, or likewiſe my ſiſters. O that it were lawfull for me to vtter vnto you the conceiptes of my ſoule, as I would deſire, or that I could open my hart vnto you on this paper, then ſhould you ſee the liuely and continuall dolour that tormenteth me!

                     ourly, being afflicted with an inceſſant fire of loue, and my hart groneth, ſigheth and lamenteth, with deſire of your preſence. Myne eyes cannot haue their fill of weeping, and albeit I ſeeke ſome conſolation againſt this bitternes, yet can I find none: but euery thing turneth into griefe: and much more when I cōſider the meanes to ſee you. I am entierly ſteeped in theſe anguiſhes, hauing none that can comfort me in this life, but that I receaue a litle conſolation from the liberal hand of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST. Which cauſeth me to beſeech you all to giue thanckes vnto his diuine maieſty for this fauour and mercy extended towardes me, and for that through his grace I finde in this Couent ſuch concord, peace and charity as by wordes cannot be expreſſed; theſe ſiſters hauing receaued me with exceeding loue &amp; deuotion, yelding me obedience with extraordinary promptitude and reuerence. They all with one accord recommend themſelues to our Lord IESVS CHRIST &amp; to you, my ſiſter, and to all the ſiſters of the monaſtery; and I recommend both my ſelfe and them to your prayers, beſeeching you as our Mother, to be mindfull of them and of me, as of your daughters: and know you that they and I, will all the dayes of our life, obſerue and keep your holy preceptes and aduertiſementes. Beſides. I deſire you ſhould know that the Pope hath accorded to whatſoeuer I demaunded him, conformably to your intention and mine, and particulerly in the matter you know; viz. that we may not poſſeſſe any thing proper. I beſeech you my moſt deere Mother, to procure of the R. Father Generall that he often viſitt vs, to comfort vs in God, whoſe grace be with your ſpiritt, Amen.
                  
               
               
                  Of an extaſie of S. Agnes, and how S. Clare ſaw her thrice crowned by an Angell.
                  THE XXXVI. CHAPTER.
                  SAinte Clare in her laſt ſicknes obtained that her ſiſter S. Agnes might come to ſee her in the monaſtery of S. Damian, to keep her company during the few dayes ſhe had to liue. And ſo S. Agnes hauing left her Couent well grounded in Religion and ſanctity, ſhe came to Aſsiſium, where ſainte Clare being one night in prayer a part from her ſiſter, ſhe neuertheles ſaw her, being alſo in prayer, lifted from

the earth, and an Angell to crowne her head three ſeuerall times with ſo many crownes. The day following ſhe demanded of her ſiſter, what player or contemplation ſhe had made the night paſt: But ſhe of humility vnwilling to manifeſt her prayer, being att length enforced by obedience, made her this relation: I conſidered the great goodnes and patience of almighty God, wherby he ſupporteth ſuch enormous offences of ſinners; which I conſidered with a deep ſorrow and compaſſion. Then I thought and yet doe thinck on the loue which almighty God beareth to ſinners, and how he endured death to ſaue them: Thirdly I conſidered and doe conſider, and am with cōpaſsion exceedingly afflicted, for the ſoules in purgatory and their great tormentes: and becauſe they cannot helpe them ſelues, I asked mercy for them of the moſt ſacred woundes of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  How S. Agnes ſent S. Clares vaile to the monaſterie of Florence, and of her death and tranſlation to S. George of Aſsiſium, with all her Religious, into a new Couent.
                  THE XXXVII. CHAPTER.
                  AFter the death of ſainte Clare, ſainte Agnes ſent her black vaile which ſhe did ordinairily weare, to the poore Religious of Moūt Celi, which ſhe had founded att Florence: which ſhe did in regard of her great amity towardes them, &amp; that they might inherite ſome reliques of ſainte Clare for their comfort and deuotion. That vaile is yet in the ſayd monaſtery, where it is ſo carefully preſerued, that in ſubſtance and colour it ſeemeth ſtill new. There is likewiſe to be ſeene in the ſame monaſtery a cloake of ſainct Francis, by which reliques our lord worcketh many miracles. A litle after the death of ſainte Clare, ſainte Agnes, alſo deſired to be preſent att the mariage of the lambe, whither ſhe was inuited: but ſhe firſt receaued the conſolatiō which ſainte Clare had promiſed her, that before ſhe departed out of this life, ſhe ſhould ſee her Spouſe IESVS CHRIST, as a taſt of the eternall felicities wherto ſhe was to be eleuated and conducted by her ſweet Spouſe CHRIST IESVS. She dyed the 56. yeare of her age, repleniſhed with perfect ſanctity; and being deliuered out of this priſon, ſhe went to poſſeſſe the kingdome with Angels and the holy virgins that had bin conſecrated to IESVS CHRIST, in which glory theſe two ſiſters and daughters of Sion, companions in heauen by nature and grace, doe prayſe God without end. There aſſembled a great multitude of people vpon the death of ſainte Agnes, and they with great deuotion aſcended the ladder of the monaſtery of ſainct Damian,

hoping there to receaue ſome ſpirituall conſolation of ſanctity, but it happened that the chaine which held the ladder did slip, ſo that al thoſe that were on it, fell downe one vpon an other: which made a great bruit and clamour by thoſe that were hurt, who hauing with a ſtrong faith inuocated S. Agnes, were all cured. The ſayd holy virgin was enterred att S. Damian, but afterward was tranſported into the Church of S. George, wher ſhe ſtill remayneth together with her ſiſter in Aſsiſium; by the which Church the Cittizens haue builded a faire monaſtery entituled S. Clare, whither were afterward remoued the Religious ſiſters of S. Damian: which was don to preuent many inconueniences that might arriue vnto them, being without the Citty. The ſaid Religious brought from S. Damian many Reliques, and particulerly the Crucifix which ſpake to S. Francis, att the beginning of his conue

                  THE XXXVIII. CHAPTER.
                  AGirle of Peruſia had a cancred fiſtula in her throat, who hauing deuotion to S. Agnes, viſited her ſepulcher. The Religious there hauing vnbound her ſoare, att the entry of the Couent, and then hauing with a ſtrong faith offered her prayers, ſhe aroſe ſound, and retourned to her houſe exceedingly comforted, yelding thanckes to God and to his ſeruant.
                  There was a Religious ſiſter att our Lady of Angels, of Peruſia, who had a mo
                        •
                     tall ſoare in her breſt, which the Phiſitions had iudged to be incurable; in it there were three holes, ſo that the Religious women exhorted her to beare this affliction with patience as proceeding from the hand of God, and to conforme her ſelfe to his will. This diſeaſed ſiſter being alwayes of minde to recommend her ſelfe to S. Agnes, kneeling one day before the Altare, ſhe with much deuotion commended her to the holy ſeruant of God, demanding of her redreſſe of her infirmity. Wher withall falling into a gentle and ſweet slumber, S. Agnes appeared vnto her, and with her hand touched her mortall wound, with which viſitatiō ſhe was ſweetly comforted and cured: &amp; at her awaking finding her ſelfe ſound, ſhe gaue infinite thankes to God and to her aduocate S. Agnes.
                  An other Religious womā of the monaſtery of Veniſe, had an impoſtume in her breaſt, which was opened by the Phiſitions &amp; found ſo dangerous, that they allotted her a very litle time to liue. This poore wretch therfore in this diſtreſſe, recōmended, her ſelfe to the two ſiſters S. Clare

and S. Agnes, and about mindnight theſe to SS. as moſt skilfull Phiſitions brought boxes of moſt precious oyntmentes, and accompayned with many virgins entred into the infirmary, where this ſick ſiſter was, which was ſeene by many Religious, and drawing neere to her bed, S. Clare ſayd vnto her: Siſter I am aſſured that you ſhalbe cured by the power and goodnes of God, and by the merittes of S. Agnes. The ſick Religious not knowing who ſpake vnto her, douhted of this reuelatiō: and the ſainctes replyed that they were P
                        •
                     iſitions of Aſsiſium. Then S. Agnes annoynted the ſoare with the oyntment ſhe had brought, and ſo the viſion diſappeared, and the diſeaſed ſiſter was in ſuch ſort cured of her mortall wound, that no apparence remayned therof.
                  An other Religious of the monaſtery of S. Clare in Aſsiſium had bin for ſixteene yeares afflicted with ſuch an infirmity, that the other Religious alwayes held her for a leapre; this diſeaſed creature beſought S. Agnes to pray to the virgin of heauen for her recouery: And this prayer being performed with a vow, the Religious was incontinently cured, and freed from all remainder of her infirmity. A Burgeſſe of Aſsiſium had bin long time lame by a blow of a ſtone receaued on his foot, and being hopeleſſe of humane remedy, on the feaſt day of S. Agnes, he wēt as wel as he could to her Church, and with a ſtrong faith and deuotion fell on his knees before her Altare. His prayer being ended, he aroſe ſound and Iuſty, which he recounted to many and thancked almighty God for it.
                  A Painter called Palmere being in a dangerous ſickneſſe, &amp; by the Phiſitiōs giuen ouer as dead: one night after his ſpeech was loſt, his brother expecting in his opinion, his laſt breathing, was exceedingly diſquieted, and comming to his bed ſide and lamenting him as already dead, he fell on his knees, addreſſed his prayers to ſainte Agnes, and with abondance of teares and great confidence made a vow, that if his brother by her merittes and interceſsion might be cured, as often as he painted her image, he would ſett a crowne of gold on her head. This prayer &amp; vow being ended, the ſick party incontinently began to ſpeake: as if he had awakened out of a profound sleep, and called for meat, and did hungerly eat, then aroſe from his bead, ſaying that two Religious women came to viſit him being in his agony and reputed for dead, and that the ſame viſitation had ſuch force, as it left him perfectly cured as he appeared.
                  A woman of Aſsiſium had a ſonne of 12. yeares age, that had an impoſtume in his breaſt, where the cancre was ſo encreaſed, that it had made it in ſuch ſort venimous as it exceeded the Phiſitions skill to cure it: This woman hauing vnderſtood that by the merits of ſainte Agnes almighty God had cured ſuch diſeaſes, ſhe commanded her ſonne often to viſit her ſepulchre, and deuoutly to recommend himſelfe vnto her: which he did,

in ſuch ſort that approching one euening ſo neere her ſepulcher that his mortall ſoare touched the ſame, and there falling a sleepe, he ſo remayned till the next morning, when awaking he found himſelfe entierly cured: for which hauing thancked God and his Sainct, he retourned to aduertiſe his mother, affirming that ſainte Clare and ſainte Agnes appeared vnto him in the night, and that ſainte Clare brought an oyntment, wherwith ſainte Agnes hauing annoynted him, he was preſently cured.
               
               
                  Of poſseſſed perſonnes deliuered by the merittes of ſaincte Agnes, and of certaine other miracles.
                  THE XXXIX. CHAPTER.
                  THere was in Aſsiſium a child of 12. yeares age, who being amōg other children, an vnknowne mā gaue him a greene beane-cod, which the boy opening, three of the beanes fell to the ground, and the fourth only he did eat, yet as ſoone as he came home, he vomited extremely, then began to tumble and furiously to behaue himſelfe, tourning and rolling his eyes in his head, in ſuch ſort as it well appeared that he endured extreme torment: and his geſture ſo terrifyed them that beheld him, that they iudged him poſſeſſed: and therfore his Father &amp; many other his kinred brought him the next morning to the Church of ſainte Clare, where hauing offered their prayers for him, and inuocated the interceſsion of ſainte Agnes, the child a litle after begā to crye and barck as a dogge, then cryed out, take heed, there are two deulls already gone out: Say an Aue Maria, &amp; the third wilbe gone. Which being preſently done, the deuill withall left the child.
                  A woman of Tullinium, being tormented with many wicked ſpirits, her Father and grand mother vowed to goe with her to Aſsiſium, to viſit the ſepulcher of S. Agnes, with faith and hope that by her merittes ſhe ſhould be deliuered, and ſo this poſſeſſed woman remayning before the ſepulchre of the S. from the ninth houre till euenſong, ſhe felt her ſelfe freed from the deuils that poſſeſſed her: this was done on the feaſt of S. Francis. The kinred of this deliuered woman offered an image of waxe weighing two poundes to the ſepulchre of the ſainct, in acknowledgement of the grace and fauoure receaued.
                  A man of Peruſia with a continuall feiuer, had in his body an impoſtume, wherof the Phiſitions gaue their iudgement he would in ſhort time end his dayes. Wherfore a woman called Celiola, admoniſhed him to recommend himſelfe to ſainte Agnes, and to vow the viſiting of her ſepulchre. Which hauing done and his prayers ended, his infirmity ended withall, being cured both of the one and the other diſeaſe; for which

not being vngratefull, he viſited the ſaid ſepulchre, and euery where preached the pray
                        •
                     es of the holy virgin, giuing thanckes to almighty God for ſuch a fauour.
                  A Religious of the Monoſtery of ſaincte Clare in Aſsiſium, had loſt the ſight of one eye, and was in danger to looſe the other. But finding that no humane application did auayle her, ſhe recommended her ſelfe to ſaincte Agnes, and the other Religious of her Monaſtery alſo prayed for her, who as ſhe one time prayed in the Church, ſaw a woman that came to her and ſaid: Siſter open your eye, for your ſight is recouered: and ſo opening her eyes ſhe clearly ſaw, but ſhe could no more ſee the woman that ſpake vnto her; only ſhe was aſſured that it was ſainte Agnes, to whome ſhe had hartely recommended her ſelfe.
                  Vitula, the wife of Matthew du Loup, att ſainct Francis gate in Aſſiſium, had a ſonne called Martin, that had a deep ſoare in his throat, and an other in his ſhoulder, both mortall, whence iſſued ſuch an offenſiue ſauour, that it was not poſsible to come neere him. Att length after many remedyes had in vaine bin tryed, his mother recommended him to ſainte Agnes, to whome hauing with a deuout hart offered her prayers, the S. one night appeared vnto her richly attyred with a diademe of gold on her head, and a branch of lilly in her right hand, and ſayd vnto her: My daughter diſquiett not thy ſelfe for they ſōne, for he ſhalbe cured and deliuered from perill. Which this woman hauing heard, ſhe aroſe full of comfort, and went to the Monaſtery of S. Clare, and recounted this apparition to the Abbeſſe and the Religious: then ſhe heard maſſe, which being ended, the Religious ſhewed to the mother and the ſonne the ſacred Reliques of the ſaint, and at the inſtant the ſonne was cured of the impoſtume in his throat only. After that, S. Agnes appeared to him in viſion together with an other womā that brought a viol full of oyntment. S. Agnes then ſayd to the child: My ſonne, how doe you? wherto he anſweared: I am by the merittes of S. Agnes cured of the impoſtume in my throat, but that which is on my ſhoulder procureth me extreme affliction. The S. replyed: I will cure this, as I did the other in thy throat: then ſhe vnbound the ſayd impoſtume, tooke of the plaiſter, and caſt it on the ground, then applyed therto the oyntment which her companion had brought, and inſtantly the child was perfectly cured. When his mother came to ſee him, ſhe found the playſters on the ground, and her ſonne ſound and luſty, who particulerly recounted vnto her the ſayd viſion, which afterward was generally diuulged: This happened in the yeare 1350.
               
               
                  
                  The life of an other ſaincte Agnes, who was daughter to the king of Bohemia, and Religious of S. Clares Order.
                  THE XL. CHAPTER.
                  IN the beginning of this Religiious Order there was an other virgin beſides the precedent called Agnes, as illuſtrious in ſanctity as in bloud, for ſhe was daughter to a king of Bohemia, who promiſed her in mariage to the Emperour Federick▪ and this holy virgin hauing heard the worthy reputation of S. Clare, who then liued, by ſuch as 
                        •
                     ame from Rome and Aſsiſium, being inſpired of God, ſhe beſought the king her Father, to giue her leaue to 
                        •
                     erue rather the celeſtiall, then a terreſt
                        •
                     iall Spouſe. But the king knowing that he could not recall his word and that whatſoeuer excuſe he ſhould alleadge to breake this mariage, the Emperour would ſiniſterly interpret it, he vtterly denyed her. Now the virgin hauing found the drift and cauſe of this denyall, aſſured her Father that if he would accord to what ſhe demaunded, ſhe would vndertake that the Emperour ſhould condiſcend thervnto, preſuming confidently on the fauour of IESVS CHRIST. She knew well to deliuer many other allegations with ſo good a grace and with ſuch perſuaſiue tearmes, that ſhe purchaced her Fathers cōſent to what ſhe deſ
                        •
                     ed, without further ſeeking the approbation of the Emperour. Whervpon this Princeſſe preſently ſent for certaine Frere Minors of Magnes, where they had a Couent, who comming to her did ſhortly after conſecrate vnto God this royall plan
                        •
                     , with many other gentlewomen of a great families of Bohemia, to whome they gaue the habitt of Religion, inſtructing thē in the life and rule of S. Clare. The king deſiring to aſsigne a good penſiō, and to beſtow on the Monaſtery where his daughter was a good reuenue, to ſupply the neceſsities therof, ſhe formally withſtood him, purpoſing to liue and dye poore, and to be maintayned by almoſe, cōformably to her rule, rigourously obſeruing the intention of the holy Father ſaint Frācis &amp; S. Clare, in the vow of pouerty, which is yet to this day in the ſame māner obſerued in the ſayd monaſtery, which is in Prague, the chiefe citty of the kingdome of Bohemia, with frō this firſt foundation, layd by this holy Princeſſe, hath alwayes bin furniſhed with gentlewomen. Now the Emperour hauing vnderſtood that his promiſed loue had abandōned the world, he was att the firſt apprehēſion exceedingly troubled: But conſidering with more maturity that ſhe had not forſaken him to take an other man, but for IESVS CHRIST himſelfe, he was att lenght ſatisfyed, contented and comforted.
                  S. Clare being aduertiſed of all that this Princeſſe had done, and of her

life and perfection, who alſo had written and expresly ſent a meſſenger to acknowledge obediēce vnto her as to her Mother and miſtreſſe, auouching her ſelfe her humble diſciple, S. Clare anſweared her by a letter filled with much feruour and conſolation, and ſent her in token of amitye and good will, a girdle, a vayle, a cupp of wood, and a diſh wherin the S. her ſelfe accuſtomed to eat, and many like ſmall thinges, which the holy Princeſſe with great deuotion accepted. Our Lord wrought many miracles by the 
                        •
                     aid Reliques, which euer afterward were kept in the ſayd Monaſtery in very great deuotion and reuerence.
                  The renowne of this Princeſſe being diuulged ouer al Almania, there were founded many monaſteries of poore Religious in her imitation, which were filled with many daughters of Princes, Dukes, Earles and other great Lordes and gentlemen of that contry, who in imitation of ſaincte Clare and the ſayd Princeſſe Agnes abandonning the world and the follyes therof, eſpouſed for eternity IESVS CHRIST, ſeruing him alone in pouerty and humility. This ſainte Agnes of Bohemia being illuſtrated by many vertues and miracles, hauing aſſembled an infinite number of Religious in diuers Couents, and hauing with them perſeuered in all perfection of vertues, ſhe left this tranſitory world to take eternall poſſeſsion of her glorious celeſtiall Spouſe CHRIST IESVS, who honoured her and made her bleſſed, as he hath maniſeſted by many miracles which he hath wrought by her great merittes &amp; interceſsions: The Emperour Charles the fourth who was alſo king of Bohemia, was two ſeuerall times deliuered from death by the interceſſion of this celeſtiall Princeſſe, and therfore att his death he enioyned his ſonne Wenceslaus and ſucceſſour in the Empire, to procure her canonization: But he was hindered by important and continuall troubles and affaires, that diſabled him to execute the pious and iuſt deſires of his Father.
               
               
                  Of many other Religious that florished primitiuely in the Order of S. Clare.
                  THE XLI. CHAPTER.
                  THere was an other holy Religious of the royal bloud of Polonia called Salome, whoſe ſanctity was manyfeſted by diuers miracles, which God wrought after her death, ſhe by her merittes deliuered many women from perill of death in trauell of child, many lame were reſtored to the vſe of their limmes, blind recouered ſight, and wounded perſonnes were cured.
                  A holy Religious of Padua, called Helena, floriſhed in great perfection of life in the monaſtery which was builded by the Seraphicall Father S.

Francis, and in which the bleſſed Father S. Antony of Padua yelded his ſpirit vnto almighty God. This holy Religious liuing in that place, after ſhe had there obtayned of God many vertues, ſhe was tryed by IESVS CHRIST, and refined as gold in the furniſe of afflictions. For ſhe kept her bed depriued of all corporall force, yea and of her ſpeech for 15. yeares, during all which time ſhe ordinarily demonſtrated by ſignes and geſtures an exceeding great alacrity and ioy in her hart. Our Lord reuealed many thinges to this ſainct, which ſhe manifeſted to the Religious who curiously recorded the ſame to be kowne to poſterity. The ſayd religious ſiſters being demaunded how the infirme Religious could make the vnderſtand thoſe wordes, ſith ſhe could not ſpeake, they anſweared that themſelues then obſerued ſo ſtrict a ſilence that they ſcarcely ſpake att all, but demaunded and opened their neceſsities by ſignes, which were well vnderſtood among them, for expreſsing whatſoeuer they deſired to haue knowen. And in that ſort had they vnderſtood the ſayd S. whoſe body for many yeares after, the ſayd Religious ſiſters did ſhew to ſuch as in deuotion repayred to ſee it, remayning entire and incorruptible, yea her nayles and haire, did grow as if ſhe had bin liuing. By her merittes God wrought many miracles, and particulerly on the Marqueſſe of Parma, who was of the family of Lupi called Boniface, who being in the anguiſh of death, the Marqueſſe his Lady making a vow to this ſainte Helene for his health, it was perfectly reſtored vnto him.
                  In the beginning of the Order of ſaincte Clare, there was alſo of it the daughter of a king of Hungary called Cuiga, ſiſter vnto bleſſed ſainte Elizabeth the widowe, who hauing taken the habitt and made profeſſion of the rule of ſaincte Clare, became ſo famous, after the death of ſainte Elizabeth, in ſanctity and miracles, both during her life and att her death, that queſtion is att Rome touching her canonization.

               WHERIN IS DESCRIBED THE INSTITVTION and rule of the third Order called of penitents, made by the holy Father S. Francis. And the liues of many of the ſaid Order, eſpecially of Sainte Elizabeth, Queene of Hongary.
               
                  How the Order of the ſeculer penitents was inſtituted by the holy Father S. Francis.
                  THE FIRST CHAPTER.
                  
                     THE Seraphicall Father ſaint Francis ſowing ouer Italy the word and ſeed of life, a good part therof fell into the hartes of men that were bound by the knott of Matrimony, and of perſonnes of ſuch like condicion, whoſe ſoules could not freely follow the ſpiritt of penance as they deſired, yet their feruour was ſuch, that ſometimes euē whole townes and villages were diſpeopled in following the holy Father ſaint Francis, who purchaſed the ſaluation of their ſoules. Wherupon this holy Father being requeſted, yea importuned generally and particulerly, to inſtitute an Order and rule wherin ſeculer and marryed people might liue to doe penance, and to liue in a more ſecure eſtate for their ſaluation: The yeare 1221. he inſtiruted the Order of Generous Penitents, whereof all Chriſtians that liue not in monaſticall Religion might yet be mēbers.

The firſt that entred this Order was an holy man called Lucius, and though no rule is found to be recorded att that time, nor forme of liuing preſcribed by S. Francis, to theſe Penitents, yet it is moſt aſſured that he gaue them certaine rules, according to which they ſhould temporally and ſpiritually gouerne themſelues, were it to faſt, or pray, more then other ſeculers, to know what office and deuotions they ſhould vſe, what almoſe they ſhould giue, how they ſhould be cloathed, and what rigour of penance they ſhould vndertake: of which ordōnances deliuered by S. Francis and recorded by them to whome he taught the ſame, Pope Nicolas the fourth cutt off one part, and left only that which was moſt eaſie inſtituting a rule, which here we will inſert, which was alſo afterward confirmed by the Apoſtolicke ſea, by three moſt ample letters patentes. And albeit the firſt and ancient habitt of theſe penitentes was afterwardes different in diuers prouinces, yet is it moſt probable, that the moſt common and general, was the ſame which thoſe of the third Order yet weare in Italy, as moſt conformable to their ſtatue. The colour is gray like to that of the Frere Minors; but the forme and faſhion is as others ſeculers doe weare: and it is credible that S. Frācis his will was that the ſayd Penitentes ſhould weare this habitt, ſi
                        •
                     h in thoſe places where this Order was by him firſt inſtituted and where he moſt conuerſed, this manner of habit was vſed. Theſe ſayd Penitents may not weare the cord as the Frere Minors. Theſe of the third rul (which haue ſucceeded thoſe) who liue in cōmon and are Religious by vow, can leſſe auouch the wearing of a cord, but muſt vſe a leather belt.
                  And it is to be noted that the Frere Minors cannot receaue theſe Penitents to the profeſsion of Religious obedience, or to any vow but only may admitt and receaue them to the ſayd rule of life and company of the Penitents, exhorting and admoniſhing them to obſerue the ſame. They may alſo aſsiſt them in confeſsion and other ſpiritual worckes as Cōfreres and true Brethren of the Order. Neuertheles the Religious may not be their Prelates or Superiours, becauſe they are ſubiect to ſeculer &amp; eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction. Theſe Penitents may yet, as is practiſed in all their Cōfraternityes, create an head or chefe by the title of Miniſter, Rector, or Priour, who ſhall haue care to aſſemble the Brethren att certaine times to conſult of matters touching their company.
                  It is alſo manifeſt that S. Francis alone, among al other authors of religions, did inſtitute and ordaine the Brethren and ſiſters of the third Order of Penitents. And becauſe he had formerly inſtituted two rules, the one of Frere Minors, and the other of poore Siſters, this Confraternity of Penitents was called the third Order: thence is deriued their denomination. Since that time ſome others Orders, principally the Begging Freres endeauour to imitate S. Francis, and to inſtitute alſo other

Confraternities of imitating Penitents or what ſuch other denomination they will, and ſubmitting themſelues in ſome ſort to the ſayd Orders, they withall enioy their priuiledges. But to the end more apparent knowledge may be had of this firſt and true Order of Penitentes, inſtituted by the holy Father S. Francis and the holy ſea, and of the fruit which they haue produced in the Church, we will proceed in declaration of this Order. Firſt we will ſett downe certaine Apoſtolicall fauours and conceſsions beſtowed on this confraternity in the beginning therof: then, the rule which the ſaid Pope Nicolas the fourth of bleſſed memory compiled &amp; approued: finally we wil deduce the illuſtrious perſonnes that haue floriſhed in the ſayd Order in all ſanctity, which wilbe a matter gratefull and worthy to be recorded.

                  THE II. CHAPTER.
                  GRegory Biſhop and ſeruant of the ſeruantes of God, to all the Brethren of the Order of Penitents inſtituted in Italy. Forſomuch as the deteſtable enuy of the ennemy of mankinde doth with greater obſtinacy perſecute the ſeruants of CHRIST IESVS, ſpreading his ſnares againſt them, and with all his power ſeeking to withdraw and remoue them from the ſeruice of the king of kinges, by malicious inuentions, we knowing that theſe hauing forſaken the vanitie of the world, though they be yet with their bodies on earth, neuertheles in ſoule and ſpiritt they conuerſe in heauen, renouncing worldly deſires for the loue of God; they enioy not only tranſitory pleaſures, but eternal richeſſe; ſo much more alſo doth he torment them, no otherwiſe then did the Egiptians perſecute the people of God, that went out of the Egipt of this world, till they periſhed by diuine punition and a new manner of death, finding &amp; receauing the end which their worckes deſerued. And after our Sauiour and Redeemer IESVS CHR. hauing
                        Matt. 4. receaued holy Baptiſme went into the deſert, where hauing faſted 40. dayes and 40. nightes, the ſame wicked ſpirit feared not to tempt him. Therfor he that addicteth himſelfe to the ſeruice of God, muſt according to the ſentence of the Sage, prepare his ſoule vnto temptations. Which
                        Eccleſ. 2. being conſidered by Pope Honorius the 3. our Predeceſſour, and that doeing worckes of Penance you were afflicted by the children of this world by diuers afflictions and croſſes: &amp; that therfore you had need to be nouriſhed and fauoured by laudable worckes, he embracing and louing your Religion in the bowels of IESVS CHR. gratified the ſame

with ſpeciall grace, commanding all Biſhoppes and Archbiſhoppes of Italy to exempt and free you from ſuch oathes as are accuſtomed to be exacted of Gouernours of townes and other officers of others places: and to protect you that you be not conſtrayned to accept publicke offices and chardges, or to be receauers of common rentes and ſuch like affaires. But becauſe the children of darcknes (who by their humane prudence haue learned to repute darcknes light, and light darcknes, and this by calomnie of ſiniſter interpretation) haue ſo afflicted you in the preiudice of your priuiledges: that you are for more vexed and chardged then before you had thoſe priuiledges, for albeit the ſayd Officers cānot exact your oathes, they find other occaſions to enforce you to ſweare; not permitting you to giue your reuenues in almoſe where you pleaſe: Wherfore you haue with great humility demaunded that we deliuer you from the obligation of ſuch oathes as you haue made, thoſe accepted of peace, faith, and teſtimony, and that you may not be chardged with impoſtes and contributions more then your other fellow Cittizens: &amp; that you may employ your reuenues in pious vſes, and diſtribute it att your pleaſure, and may not be troubled for the debtes and faultes of your neighbours, but that you be obliged to anſweare the debtes of others for which you ſhalbe engaged. We then conſidering that you enter into the way of perfection, and that the children of the world will ſo much the more hinder you, as they are and know themſelues different frō your holy life, and that they make a confuſed heape of peruerſe oppoſitions, to hide and obſcure the veritie: doe by aucthority of theſe preſent letters, giue and graunt to all you in your vniuerſity (of whoſe faith and Religion we hold our ſelues aſſured) the permiſsion which you demaund of vs in all the ſayd matters: moſt expresly commanding you, that yon endeauour to vſe the grace and fauour well which we beſtow on you, and that none of you abuſe the ſame: Vnleſſe you wilbe fruſtrated and depriued of the priuiledge which we graunt you: and therfore lett none &amp;c.

                  THE III. CHAPTER.
                  GRegory Biſhop and ſeruant of the ſeruantes of God, to the Archibiſhoppes, Biſhoppes and Prelates of the church of Italy. It being euident, that the intention of thoſe who are mindfull of death is, not to follow the vanitie of the world, but IESVS CHRIST, doeing pennance with an humble hart by true contrition, chaſticing and ſubiecting the ſences to reaſon, and that their intention is to apply themſelues to the ſeruice of God: So that it were an iniuſt thing, that theſe cō
                     fraternityes ſhould be ſeparated and depriued of the diuine offices &amp; Eccleſiaſticall ſacraments: it being reaſonable that they receaue ſome ſpeciall fauour of the holy Apoſtolike ſea in theſe and other matters that concerne the ſeruice of God. There being then many through Italy that obſerue this order of life which ſome call Brothers Penitents, we cōmand your prudence, by this our Apoſtolicall Briefe, that in the Churches of your iuriſdiction, wherin it is generally permitted you to ſay the diuine office in time of interdiction, you doe admitt and receaue them alſo in to the Church in the ſayd time of interdiction, prouided alwayes that they be not cauſe of the ſayd interdiction: the which office neuertheles ſhall not be ſayd but after expelling the interdicted and excommunicated out of the Church, the dores being ſhutt and no ringing of belles; and that you alſo admitt them to the Eccleſiaſticall ſacraments and to buriall in Churches or church yardes.

                  THE IV. CHAPTER.
                  GRegory Biſhop, to the Archibiſhoppes and Biſhops of Italy. It doth too maniſtly appeare, how the clemencie of God is abuſed by ſuch as hinder or delay thoſe who withall their hart deſire and ſeeke to ſerue IESVS CHRIST, in conuerting themſelues vnto him. And yet no man doubteth but they are accurſed of God, that ſpread their ambuſhes againſt the ſayd ſeruants

                     o make them ſtumble, diſturbing them by diuerſe perſecutions, as imitators

of Pharo, who hauing his harte obdurate, neuer permitted the people of God to depart out of Egipt but by force of chaſticement: and being departed, did not omitt to perſecute them by tyranies and crueltyes, till himſelfe and all his were ſubmerged by the diuine right hand, leauing to all an example that his like deſerue the like puniſhment; you therfore muſt vnderſtand, that being come to the knowledge of Pope Honorius the third, our predeceſſour of bleſſed memory, that ſome in your quarters, very prudently conſidering their end, reſolued to doe penance in their owne howſes or other where, and deſirous more purely to approch vnto almighty God, they abandon the vanities of this world, and doe impoſe on their miſerable fleſh (the true daughter of Babilon) ſo much paine and affliction, as it would impoſe on their ſoules the true daughters of God, that by this meane the fault and puniſhment which they haue merited, may by his diuine Maieſty the more eaſily be remitted. But the Gouerners and Magiſtrates of the Citties and townes where they reſided, not conſidering, that they who really ſerue God doe not entangle themſelues with affaires and buſineſſe of this world, wherwith the Eſpouſe will not foule or defile the

Wherfore our office of Paſtor being to fauour ſuch as by ſuch reſolutions &amp; lanctity of life become the friendes of God, after the example of our ſayd predeceſſour of bleſſed memory, we by this Apoſtolicall B

We with a benigne fauour doe aſsiſt all ſuch as being deuoutly cō
                     uerted vnto God, produce in his Church fruites worthy of penance, to deſerue att the handes of God an eternall recompence. The Confraternities called the third Order of S. Francis being very remarckable among them through Italy and the Ile of Sicilie, we condeſcending to their iuſt petitions, doe by aucthority of theſe preſents command your prudence, to appoint vnto them in time conuenient, Religious of your Order of capacity to be viſitors, who inſtructing them in matters fitt for them to doe, ſhall correct and reforme them, as cauſe ſhall require, and ſhall chaſtice the tranſgreſſours, and reſtraine them by Eccleſiaſticall cēſures.

                  Of the authenticall institution of the first rule and forme of life of the Brethren Penitents of the third Order of S. Francis, ordayned by Pope Nicolas the 4. inſerted with the ſaid rule.
                  THE VI. CHAPTER.
                  NIcolas Biſhop, ſeruant of the ſeruantes of God, to our welbeloued children in our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, the Brethren &amp; ſiſters of the Order of Penitents, preſent and to come, health and Apoſtolicall benediction. The firme foūdation of Chriſtian Religiō, being already grounded &amp; built on the Mount of the Catholick Faith, the pure deuotion of the diſciples of IESVS CHRIST, boyling with the fire of charity, and by the word preached to them that liue in darckneſſe: this faith is that which the Romane Church holdeth and profeſſeth, the foundation wherof cannot ſhake for whatſoeuer tribulation that may aſſault it, nor fall, whatſoeuer violent tempeſt beat againſt it: becauſe it is the true, and right faith, without which none can be gratefull to God, nor find grace with his diuine Maieſty. It is the the ſame alſo that ſheweth the way of ſaluation, and that promiſeth the recompenſes and cō
                     tentments of eternall beatitude. And therfore the Confeſſour of IESVS CHRIST S. Francis, inſtitutor of this Order, teaching by word and example the meane to mount vnto heauen, denounced and preached the ſincerity of this faith to his children, and inſtituted this Order, willing them accordingly to make profeſsion of the Catholike Faith, to the end that they who faithfully obſerue the ſame walking ſecurely in the way of vertue, may meritt to be made poſſeſſors of the eternall glory, after the priſon of this preſent life.
               
               
                  
                  Of the meane to examine them that will enter into the ſaid Order.
                  THE FIRST CHAPTER.
                  ANd for ſo much as we are willing to aſsiſt this Order with cō
                     uenient fauour deſiting the augmentatation therof: we ordaine that all thoſe who are to be receaued to the obſeruation of this forme of life, ſhalbe formerly withall dilligence examined touching the Catholike faith, to ſee if they firmely confeſſe the ſayd faith, and obedience to the ſayd Church, thē theymay be ſecurely admitted vnto the Order. But eſpecially dilligent care muſt be had that no heretike, or ſuſpected of hereſie, and noted with infamy, be admitted to this forme of life. And if any ſhould be receaued being knowne for ſuch, lett him be preſently diſcouered to the Inquiſitor, that he may be puniſhed and corrected.
               
               
                  In what manner they ought to be receaued, who deſire to enter into the ſayd Order.
                  THE II. CHAPTER.
                  WHen any one ſhall preſent himſelfe to be admitted into this company, the ſuperiour Miniſters ordayned to receaue him, ſhall make an exact enquiery of his eſtate and condition, and propoſe vnto him the obligation of the company: and particulerly reſtitution of goodes iniuſtly poſſeſſed. Which done, and he conſenting, lett him be cloathed according to the Order, and lett him endeauour to ſatisfie his Creditors, if he owe any thing, either with ready mony or ſecurity of pledge: and lett him att length find meanes to content and ſatisfie them in ſome or other manner, and ſo be reconciled to his neighbour. Which being accompliſhed, and the yeare of probation expired, if the diſcreet Brethren be of opinion and hold it requiſit to admitt him, he ſhalbe receaued on theſe conditions: which are, that he promiſe to keep the diuine preceptes, and to ſatisfie the ſtatutes and conſtitutions wherto he ſhalbe bound and obliged: as alſo to performe the penance that ſhalbe enioyned him, or the puniſhment ordayned if he proue obſtinate and a tranſgreſſour: and to obey the viſitor, before whome he ſhall appeare if he be called, and ſhall ſubmitt himſelfe to his iudgement: and to all this aforeſayd he ſhall oblige himſelfe by ſubſcription before publike Notaries; neither ſhall it be permitted to the prouinciall Miniſter to receaue any, but vpon the ſayd conditions, except

ſome notable conſiderations doe otherwiſe require, and that the quality of the per

But we permitt him to enter into an other approued Religion. Maryed women alſo may not be receaued, without the conſent of their husbands.
               
               
                  Of the forme of their habitt, and how they must be clothed.

Their cloakes and other habits ſhalbe as decencie requireth without cuttinges, and their ſleeues ſhalbe ſimple, cloſe, and ſtraight: the ſiſters ſhall weare a cloake and gowne or coat of courſe cloth alſo, and vnder their cloke ſhall weare a white or black habit, or a very long coat of linnen cloth or canuas without plaites. The ſiſters may be diſpenſed withal in the courſnes of the cloth of their habits according to their need, the qualitye of the perſonnes, and condition of the places. They ſhall vſe neither buttons nor girdles of ſilke, nor beſides the ſaid cloth, may vſe any furres other then lambes skin:their purſes ſhalbe of leather, and their girdles plaine, without any ornament of ſilke, neither ſhall they weare any thing elſe, forſaking, according to the behoufull counſaile of ſaint Peter, all other vaine ornamentes of this world.

                     quettes, playes, dances, and diſhoneſt ſpectacles, &amp; to giue mony or any other thing to ſee ſuch vanityes: neither muſt they permitt any of their ſeruantes to giue any thing to that purpoſe.

They that haue bin lett bloud, may eat fleſh three times that weeke. They alſo that trauell may eat fleſh on the dayes permitted by the Church; it is alſo permiſſable

to eat it on principall and ſolemne feaſtes. The dayes whereon is no obligation of faſting, they may eat cheeſe and egges: and when they ſhall come to conuentuall houſes, they may care with other Religious what ſhalbe ſett before them. But they muſt content themſelues with two meales a day, except in caſe of neceſsity, trauell or weakeneſſe: for then this rule doth not oblige. Lett the eating and d

And if att any time they fo gett the ſame, lett them ſay three for one. They ſhall faſt all the fridayes of the yeare, it they be not hindered by ſickneſſe, or ſome other lawfull excuſe. If the Natiuity of our Lord fall on a friday, they ſhall not be obliged to faſt on that day. From the feaſt of Alſainctes to Eaſter, they ſhalbe bound to faſt euery wedneſday and friday, beſides the other ordinary faſtes appointed by the Church. They ſhalbe alſo obliged to faſt euery day from the lēt of ſainct Martin till Chriſtmas: and from Quinquageſima ſunday till Eaſter, the ſundayes excepted. Women with child, if they will, ſhalbe exempted from all corporall auſterityes and rigours from their time of being great, till after their churching, during which time they ſhalbe obliged only to prayer. Artificers that labour with the ſweat of their bodyes, may make three meales, from Eaſter day to S. Francis day, if they know it needfull. They that are hyred labourers and haue their dyett prouided, may eat of what ſhalbe preſented them except the friday, and other faſtes commanded.

                  ALl the Brethren and ſiſters in whatſoeuer place or citty they dwell muſt euery day, if they may, heare Maſſe, and euery mōth they ſhall meet and aſſemble in ſome place deputed by the Miniſter Rectour, to heare a ſolemne Maſſe: and there each of them ſhall giue an almoſe to the Chappelain or other elected to that end, which ſhalbe diſtributed by the Rectour Miniſter, among the Brethren and ſiſters that are in greateſt neceſsity, and particulerly among the ſick. This almoſe ſhall alſo be employed in the buriall and funerales of the poore deceaſed: and what remayneth ſhalbe diſtributed to the other poore. Some part of this almoſe alſo ſhalbe giuen to the Church where they aſſēble. And euery time that they meet, they ſhal endeauour to haue ſome good Religious to preach vnto them, who ſhall induce them to penance and to the exerciſe of charitable worckes. Lett all the Brethren be admoniſhed to keep ſilence and to be attentiue att prayer during the diuine office, eſpecially whiles Maſſe is celebrated, and the word of God preached: vnleſſe the common good of the confraternity otherwiſe require.
               
               
                  How the ſick are to be viſited, and what care muſt be had of the dead.
                  THE XIV. CHAPTER.
                  WHen any of the Brethren ſhalbe ſick, the ſuperiour Miniſters being therof in the behalfe of the ſick party aduertiſed, they ſhall viſitt or cauſe him to be viſited at leaſt once in a weeke, admoniſhing him touching the ſtate of his ſoule, as farre foorth as they ſhal find it requiſit. And if he be poore, they ſhalbe carefull to procure him what is neceſſary, out of the almoſe of the poore: And if the ſick perſon doe dye, all the Brethren and ſiſters of the Confraternity that ſhalbe in the towne or place where they dye, ſhalbe preſently aduertiſed therof, to the end they be preſent att the funerals: whence they ſhall not depart till the

diuine office be ended and the body interred. The like ſhalbe obſerued towardes the ſiſters that are ſick, and that depart out of this life. Eight dayes after the death of any Brother, all the Brethren and ſiſters of the Confraternity ſhalbe obliged, to ſay for their ſoules (the Prieſtes) a Maſſe of the dead, they that can read, 50. pſalmes, and they that cannot read, 50. Pater noſters, with Requiem aternam. Lett alſo be procured to be ſayd three Maſſes euery yeare for the Brethren and ſiſters departed. They that can read the pſalter, ſhall att their commodity ſay it entierly euery yeare, and they that cannot read, ſhall ſay 100. Pater noſters adding Requiem eternam att the end of each one.

                  THe ſuperiour Miniſters, Brethren and Siſters of euery towne or place in time to that end appointed, ſhall aſſemble in ſome Monaſtery or Church there to make their common viſitation: where their viſitors ſhalbe Prieſtes of ſome approued Religion and of exemplare life, that they may impoſe on the delinquent, healthfull penance for their ſinnes committed, neither lett any other be admitted to his office of Miniſter. And becauſe this forme of life had its originall from the holy Father Saint Francis: We counſaile them to chooſe viſitors and reformers of this confraternity, of the Order of Frere Minors, who ſhall conſerue it and haue particuler care therfore. And when the Superiours or Gardians ſhalbe therunto required, they ſhall freely accept therof. This office of viſitation ſhalbe kept att leaſt once in a yeare, or oftener if it ſhalbe neceſſary. The obſtinate, diſobedient and incorrigible ſhalbe firſt admoniſhed three ſeuerall times: after which, if they will not amend, lett them by the aduiſe of the diſcreet Brethren, as incorrigible perſons be excluded and expelled their confraternity.

And therfore it is neceſſary for the faithfull of the ſame Church, to haue eſpeciall care, as hauing bin diligently educated in the innocencie of ſincerity and verity, not to deface and corrupt the doctrine and conſtitutions of the Succeſſour of the ſame Prince, or in whatſoeuer manner by wordes of murmure to hinder the ſame: for as the Apoſtle ſaith: He is contrary to the Ordinances of God that reſiſteth his power. Sith then the holy ſeruant of God and ſinguler Confeſſour of IESVS CHRIST S. Francis, enflamed with the burning fire of charity, diſciple both in wordes and worckes of the glorious Apoſtles, aduancing himſelfe with a ſpiritt full of verity, to augment the family in the houſe of our Redeeemer IESVS CHRIST, with intention to reduce into the way of ſaluation the feet of ſuch as walked in darcknes, inſtructing them without learning, he hath infrituted an Order with the title of Penitents, to whome he hath giuen meane to meritt eternall life.

                  Of the Innocencie and vertue of S. Elizabeth in her moſt tender youth.
                  THE VIII. CHAPTER.
                  THis bleſſed S. the daughter of king Henry of Hongary was royally educated in her Fathers houſe: but being by diuine grace illuminated, and opening the eyes of hir natural knowledg, ſhe timely began to miſpriſe the vanities of the world and the apprehenſions of youth, chaunging them into deſires to ſerue God. And from fiue yeares old ſhe continued and perſeuered in prayer in the Church, with ſuch mature grauity and ſuch repoſe, that her Gouerneſſe had much labour to withdraw her thence. And therfore ſhe was often conſtrayned to find occaſions to goe into her chappell att accuſtomed howers, where ſhe would ſpend ſuch time as ſhe could, and make her prayer proſtrate on her bare knees, vſing all induſtry to induce her waiting ladyes to doe the

like, and to pray, read pſalmes, and be deuout and honour the ſainctes. She ſo vſed the matter that ſhe drew a ſpirituall fruit out of the very playes and paſtimes that her Ladyes vſed: for ſhe obliged thoſe that loſt, to ſay certaine Paters Noſters and Aue Maries, or to giue ſuch a ſomme to the poore. And as her yeares encreaſed, ſo did alſo her deuotion, purity and zeale in all vertues, chooſing the ſacred Virgin Mary for her Aduocate and S. Iohn the Euangeliſt for the Guardian of her innocencie, to whome ſhe was ſo ſpecially deuoted, that ſhe denyed nothing, which being in her power to giue was demaund for his ſake. She had her ſpiritt ſo eleuated, that ſhe tooke occaſion of euery matter preſented, to ſtirre her ſelfe to deuotion, in ſuch ſort that when ſhe was conſtrayned to be preſent att aſſemblies of magnificence and ſportes, ſhe would often, in the middeſt of the greateſt pleaſure and contentment that could happen therin, leaue the company: which ſhe would doe ſo dexterously and prudently, that it much edified all that were preſent. She was cloathed very decently and modeſtly, and did eat temperatly: and then cauſed to be giuen to the poore (which then attended for ſuch almoſe att her dore) the reſt of the meat prepared for her: ſhe would be preſēt att the diuine ſeruice with great reuerence and deuotion. Whiles the Ghoſpell was read, and att the eleuation of the moſt ſacred Hoſt, ſhe would put off her gloues, iewels, and other precious ornaments of her head, and lay them on the ground, for greater reuerence to almighty God. She neuer omitted her ordinary prayers and pious exerciſes, and ſometimes would watch a good part of the night, to ſatisfye the omiſſions and employments of the day.
               
               
                  Of S. Elizabeths perſeuerance in vertues after she was maryed, of her pious behauiour, and of her patience in her afflictions.
                  THE IX. CHAPTER.
                  THis heroicall Lady being eleuated and nourced in theſe pious exerciſes, ſhe by diuine inſpiration entierly reſigned her ſelfe to whatſoeuer it pleaſed God to ordayne and diſpoſe of her: for albeit ſhe had reſolued with her ſelfe neuer to haue other Spouſe then IESVS CHRIST, yet did the diuine prouidence otherwiſe ordayne: for ſo much as her Father to whome ſhe was moſt obedient, enforced her to mary Lantgraue, Duke of Toringe, of the greateſt Princes and of faireſt poſſeſsions of Germanie; diſpoſing this marriage for the extreme neceſsity that the Toringians had (being halfe barbarous) of ſome one to excite them to the loue of God, and to the practiſe of charitable worckes towardes their neighbour, and worthy merittes of the

vertue of chaſtity. This holy princeſſe found much trouble with her husband the firſt yeare, not that he wanted ſufficient inclination to vertue, but by reaſon of the ill diſpoſition of thoſe of his counſaile, and of ſome particuler ſeruants and domeſticall officers of his, who interpreted and reputed the great humility of this worthy Princeſſe, for ſottiſhnes and want of ciuility and Courtlie complements: and therfore did contemne and perſecute her to their vtmoſt. But by her continuall prayers ſhe obtayned of God many particuler graces, and namely that her husband ſhould not only not hinder her holy exerciſes, but ſhould be very ioyfull, the which incontinently came to paſſe. For being repleniſhed with the feare of God, he permitted her ſecretly to doe whatſoeuer ſhe thought to tend to the ſeruice of his diuine Maieſty, comforting her ordinarily in the diſguſtes and diſcontentmēts that ſhe might fall into by the ſubtility of the deuill in ſpirituall life, and by ſweet wordes encouraging her for the good of her ſoule: In ſuch ſort that albeit this holy Princeſſe had chaunged her eſtate, yet did ſhe not deſiſt from her pious exerciſes and holy intentions, alwayes vſing very rigorous penance, afflicting her body by diſciplines watchinges and abſtinences, and did alſo very often ariſe from her husbands bed, and ſpent the reſt of the night in prayer vnto God. And if ſometimes sleep did ouercome her, ſhe would only make vſe of a pillow on the ground to sleep on. And when her husband was from home, ſhe would employ the whole night in prayer, in the company of her celeſtiall Spouſe. She ſecretly woare a haircloth, and very often vſed diſciplining to conforme her ſelfe to her Sauiour, that would be ſo cruelly ſcourged for vs. She was ſo ſeuere in her abſtinence, and kept it ſo perfectly, that in the middeſt of banquettes, of the abondance and delicacie of the moſt exquiſit diſhes, ſhe would often content her ſelfe with only bread, and would entertaine thoſe that were with her att table with caruing and preſenting meat vnto them, to the end they might not obſerue her, but might thinck ſhee did eat indifferently of euery diſh. Becauſe ſhe tooke no pleaſure to behold ſo much good meat, ſhe would often ſend to a poore yet vertuous ſeruant of hers for ſome of his ordinary dyet. wheron ſhe would feed. Her husband obſeruing all theſe thinges did tolerat them with an extreme admiration and deuotion, and would ſay, that he would wilingly doe the like, but that it was neceſſary for him to conſerue his houſe and eſtate.
               
               
                  
                  Of the prayer, humility, pouerty, obedience and forgetfulnes of iniuries, of S. Elizabeth, and of the reuelation which God made vnto her of the remiſſion of her ſinnes.
                  THE X. CHAPTER.
                  THis vertuous woman was ſo feruent in prayer, that ſhe neuer prayed without weeping, and yet in ſuch ſort as ſhe kept it vnknowne. In her prayer ſhe felt both ſorrow and ioy in her ſoule: ſhe would ſay that to weepe with force and heauineſſe was to ſhew an euill countenance vnto God. It once happened that being according to her cuſtome in prayer, her hart, eyes and handes eleuated towardes heauen, her ſoule was ſo rapt and ſwallowed vp in God, that burning coales falling on a fold or plait of her gowne, burned a good part therof ſhe not perceiuing it, and had burned yet farther, if one of her ſeruantes paſsing by, had not haſtely extinguiſhed the ſame: in doeing wherof ſhe cryed ſo loud that ſhe cauſed the pious lady to retourne to her ſelfe, who with her owne handes ſett a piece on that part of her gowne which was burned. She would not haue her ſeruantes and the poore people to cal her Lady, but would cōuerſe with them as their equall cauſing them to ſitt by her, and eating, ſpinning and worcking with them without any ceremony. She ſo affected humility, that ſhe diſdayned not or omitted the baſeſt occurance for the loue of God. In the middeſt of the greateſt proſperity that ſhe euer had, ſhe alwayes deſired the eſtate of pouerty, to imitate and follow that of IESVS CHRIST in this life, ſhunning all pompe and worldly glory. By this fauour and holy deſire, ſhe would often being alone in her houſe with her friendes and ſeruantes, cloath her ſelfe poorly, affirming that if ſhe fell into pouerty, ſhe would in that ſort be cloathed. She would be alwayes preſent att generall proceſsions and litanies, bare foot, and attyred in linnen, and with great humility would heare the ſermons among the ſimple people. When ſhe went firſt to Church in the morning, ſhe would not goe attyred according to her quality, but the moſt ſimply ſhe could, in example of the Virgin Mary, carying her child in her armes and laying it very reuerently on the Altare, there offring a lambe and a candell. Retourning home after the ſeruice, ſhe would giue the cloathes ſhe woare att maſſe to ſome very poore woman. And the more perfectly to obſerue the rule of humility, ſhe promiſed obedience in that concerned the good of her ſoule to her Cōfeſſour M. Courard a poore Religious, but of great piety and doctrine, whoſe counſailes, though generally vertuous,

ſhe ſo ſtrictly obſerued, as if IESVS CHRIST himſelfe had commanded her. By this obedience and vpō a ſcruple of her conſciēce ſhe would neither touch nor vſe any thing bought with the mony a

                        es is very pleaſing vnto God. Hauing in her widowhood receaued a great iniury, which exceedingly troubled and diſquieted her, ſhe fell to her prayers, and began with great abondance of teares to pray vnto God for thoſe that had done her iniury, beſeeching him to beſtow on each of them a grace wherby they might receaue ſome conſolation of his diuine Maieſty. During the feruour of this prayer, ſhe heard a voice that ſayd vnto her: thou haſt neuer preſented a prayer vnto me more gratefull then this, which hath thorough pearced my bowels. Wherfore I pardon thee all thy ſinnes, and giue thee my grace. This holy Princeſſe knowing the mercy which God had ſhewed her, conſidered with her ſelfe, what courſe of life ſhe might thenceforward vndertake to become more gratefull to his diuine Maieſty, and to ſerue him more dilligently. But being in deep conſideratiō herevpō, the ineffable ſearcher of hartes ſayd vnto her: hope in God, doe good worckes, and ſhunne ſinne, &amp; thou ſhalt alwayes haue cōfort.
               
               
                  Of the deuotion of this S. towardes the Frere Minors, and how, doubting of the loue of God towardes her, he miraculously diſplanted a tree, and replanted it where she deſired.
                  THE XI. CHAPTER.
                  THis bleſſed lady was both a ſinguler mother and daughter vnto the Frere Minors, as one repleniſhed with the ſpiritt of pouer

Her husband perceauing that ſhe was more ſad then of cuſtome, asked her the cauſe: wherto ſhe anſweared, that it was becauſe ſhe had not in a long time ſeene any ſeruant of God, nor of them heard the word of his diuine Maieſty: And therfore was ſhe ſo heauy and melancholy both interiourly and exteriourly.

The ſequell was moſt admirable, for thoſe wordes were no ſooner ſpoaken, but the tree was diſplanted by the rootes and tranſplanted on the ſide of the riuer where they were.

                  Of the great charity of this holy Princeſſe, and how she ſpent her time in worckes of mercy.

And this compaſsionate Princeſſe hauing prayd for her, ſhe retourned to her ſelfe. She earned mony by ſpinning and ſowing with her maydes, which ſhe diſtributed to the poore. She alſo employed her ſelfe in that exerciſe, to giue example of humility vnto her women and maydnes, and to ſhunne idlenes. He

An other time wanting mony for the like ſupply, ſhe ſold her iewels, and with the price therof,

                     eleiued the needy. She would often times withdraw thinges neceſſary, from her ſelfe, her women and maydes, to ſupply the neceſsity of the poore. She cauſed an hoſpitall to be builded att the foot of her caſtell, which was very high, where ſhe placed all the poore ſick people, and euery day went downe to viſitt them, albeit the diſcent was very troubleſome and difficult, and releiued their neceſsities, exhorting them to patience and to purge their ſoules by confeſsion and communion. She ſerued, attended, and dreſſed them withan exemplar humility, ſupporting with an extreme patience, the loathſomes that iſſued out of their ſoares, and ſometimes hauing no other linnen att hand to make them cleane, ſhe would putt off her coife &amp; disfurniſh her head to dry and wipe off the filthy matter of the ſaid ſoares, which ſo ſtrongly ſauoured that her Ladies could not endure them.
               
               
                  Of the death of the Duke her husband, and of many afflictions which she endured in her widowhood.
                  THE XIII. CHAPTER.
                  OVr Lord had by his grace and by the prayers and petitions of the Ducheſſe, cōuerted the Lātgraue, ſo that albeit he were by the affaires of his eſtate and his poſſeſsions exceedingly hindered frō the ſeruice of God, yet did he not omitt to haue good deſires and with his vtmoſt put in practiſe good worckes. But becauſe he could not perſiſt in ſpirituall exerciſes, he permitted his wife to employ her ſelfe therin for the honour of God and the benefitt of both their ſoules. And this vertuous woman deſiring her husband ſhould employ his forces, in defence of the Catholike faith, ſhe induced him to viſit the holy land, and to aſsiſt the Chriſtians in recouery therof. He then to this effect hauing with his troupes for ſo laudable an enterpriſe aduanced his iorney ſo far as Italy, reſted att Brindes to attend

conuenient time and weather to take ſhipping: But it pleaſed God that he ther fell ſick of a mortall infirmity, ſo that he ſhortly after with an exemplar contrition, yelded his ſpiritt vnto God. S. Elizabeth being aduertiſed of his death, receaued her widowhood with almoſt the like wil as ſhe had don her mariadge, reſoluing to apply her ſelfe entierly to the ſeruice of her celeſtiall Spouſe. And ſo almighty God began to viſitt her with greater afflictions, as hauing a ſoule more free, and was a litle more ſublime then euer. For as ſoone as the death of the Lantgraue was diuulged, ſhe was by his kinred and vaſſalles expulſed her palace, as if ſhe had bin a prodigall waſter of the reuenue of her eſtate: and was ſo abandoned, that the night following (as a reiected creature) not knowing where to repoſe, ſhe retyred in to a cottage employed for the ſhelter of beaſtes. There ſhe ioyfully gaue thanckes to God for her misfortune, which ſhe reputed as a great fauour and moſt ſinguler grace. The next morning, ſhe repayred vnto the monaſtery of the Frere Minors, and prayed the Religious to ſing Te Deum laudamus in thanckes-giuing to God, for that according to her deſire he had afforded her the eſtate of pouerty. After that ſhe ordered her children to be diſpoſed into diuer▪s places, to be inſtructed and educated according to their quality and degree, hauing no meane to retaine them any longer with her, many iniuryes and affrontes being impoſed on her by the kinred of her deceaſed husband in his vaſſals, which ſhe ioyfully &amp; with inuincible patience ſupported as a fauour ſent her by almighty God. An archibiſhop that was her vnckle cauſed her no ſmall affliction, in that ſeeing her yong and reduced to ſuch pouerty, he reſolued to beſtow her honorably in mariage. But the eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST, hauing layd a firme reſolution rather to dye then to mary againe, obtayned of God by meane of prayer, the victory in ſo ſtrong a conflict. Whiles ſhe honorably remayned in a caſtle of her vnckles, the body of her husband was brought from Brindes, which was receaued by the ſayd Archibiſhop with a very ſolemne troup and proceſsion of the Clergie, and accompayned by the ſayd Princeſſe with many teares, ſhe thus ſpeaking vnto almighty God: I giue thee infinite thanckes, O ſoueraine Bounty that it hath pleaſed thee to comfort me with the receipt of the bones of my deceaſed husband thy ſeruant. Thou alone knoweſt my God, how much I loued him, becauſe he loued and feared thee. And neuertheles thou knoweſt alſo what conſolation I haue receaued of his death, being depriued of his preſence, euen for thy loue, in that he went to ſerue thee for the recouery of the holy land: and albeit I receaued an exceeding contentment to liue with him, yet was it with condicion that we both together might trauell as poore beggers ouer the world:

But ſith that may not be, thou knoweſt my God, that if it were in my power to reſtore him to life, I would not doe it, nor were it requiſi

The king of Hongary hauing vnderſtood the death of the Lantgraue his ſonne in law, and the miſerable eſtate of his daughter, and with what impiety ſhe was perſecuted by the ſubiectes of her husband, he ſent one of the principall Earles of his kingdome, to bring her vnto him: who hauing ſought her, found her ſpinning of wooll among very poore women, wheratt he ſo admired and was ſo g

                  How S. Elizabeth became religious, and founded a great hoſpitall for the vſe of poore ſick people.
                  THE XIV. CHAPTER.
                  THis bleſſed widow had vowed that if ſhe ouer-liued her husband, ſhe would ſpend the reſt of her dayes in perpetuall chaſtity, obedience and pouerty, which ſhe failed not with much feruour to accompliſh; and the
                        •
                     fore ſhe toke the habitt of the Penitents of the third Order of S. Francis, and being clothed in a coat and cloke of groſſe gray cloth, all patched with ſackloth, ſhe promiſed obedience to her Confeſſour called Fa. Courad, a Religious of notable ſanctity, which ſhe moſt exactly obſerued, euen in worckes of penance, as faſtes, diſciplines, and other mortifications, in which vertues this holy Religious man did exerciſe her for the greater benifitt of her ſoule. And to the end ſhe might entierly deliuer her hart in poſſeſsion vnto God, without being diſtracted or hindered by any temporall affection, ſhe beſought his diuine maieſty to ſetle in her hart ſuch a miſpriſe of al temporalities, as might depriue her euen of her loue to her children, and giue her force, to ſupport all the iniuryes of this life. Ariſing from this prayer, ſhe went and thus ſpake to her companions: Know ye, that almighty God hearing my prayers hath graunted me, that henceforward I ſhall neuer eſteeme all the magnificences, amities, and other deceiptfull allurements of the world, more then filth, yea neither ſhall I haue any care

of my children, more then of my neighbours, to the end I apply my loue to nothing but his diuine maieſty. After ſhe had taken the religious habitt, ſhe with greater feruour addicted her ſelfe to prayer, as alſo to worcks of mercy; and hauing receaued 2000. Marckes of mony as part of her dowry, ſhe gaue the greateſt part therof to the poore, and with the reſt builded an honorable and commodious hoſpitall, to entertaine poore ſick people, and there to haue them cheriſhed, attended and medicined: wherein her ſelfe, as the moſt humble ſeruant, ſerued the poore ſick creatures, yea with ſuch charity as ſhe waſhed their feet, and made their beddes: and then would ſay to her companions that aſsiſted her: we haue this day receaued a great fauour of God in that we haue waſhed, couered and ſerued him, ſith it is he whome we ſerue in his poore people. She relieued and aſsiſted with ſuch great feruour and humility, that in one night ſhe carryed a poore blind and very ſick boy, ſix times to his neceſsities, albeit he was euery where full of filth and lothſomnes, and then ioyfully waſhed the linnen that he had fouled. There was in this hoſpitall a leapreſſe, whome ſhe often purified, though ſhe were ſo couered with filth and leproſie, that one could not ſo much as behold her without horrour. But this Princeſſe did handle her as if ſhe had bin very cleane, dreſſed her meat, gaue it her to eat, and applyed her medicins, pulled off her hoſe, and pared her nailes with ſuch promptitude as ſhe procured a ſtrang admiration in all the beholders: She cauſed the ſick ordinarily to confeſſe and communicate: and in like caſe a poore old and ſick woman, that had no will to confeſſe, was by her corrected and made confeſſe. She waſhed and ſhrouded the dead bodyes with her owne handes, and with very great deuotion attended them to buryall. Our Lord by many miracles which he wrought by this bleſſed lady, made appea

                     e how gratefull this worck of mercy was vnto his diuine maieſty.
               
               
                  What order S. Elizabeth obſerued, and the miracles she wrought in the ſaid Monaſterie.
                  THE XV. CHAPTER.
                  SAinte Elizabeth in her hoſpitall ordayned, that no poore perſon ſhould be admitted without being formerly confeſſed, becauſe a man in mortall ſinne doth not deſerue att the handes of God, the bread he eateth. It one time happened that a blind man demaunded entertaynment in the ſayd hoſpitall, but becauſe he would not confeſſe, he was not admitted: wherfore retourning he murmured, blaſphemed and tayled for that he was reiected thence. But being charitably reprehended

and admoniſhed by this vertuous Lady and a Frere Minor, he was conuerted and very deuoutly confeſſed his ſinnes, and then was admitted into the hoſpital, where being, the Religious man ſayd to S. Elizabeth: Sith you haue receaued the blind man, and haue giuen him to eat, you muſt alſo if you pleaſe, reſtore him his ſight. The S. as one full of humility, anſweared: Father that which you require is a worck of importance, and ſuch as none but God can doe, as he alone that illuminateth the blinde: but ſith it hath pleaſed his infinite bounty ſo mercifully to graunt him the light of grace, I ſhalbe glad that he voutchſafe him that of his eyes. And therfore Father, obtaine you of his diuine maieſty the light of one eye, and I wil endeauour to pray for the other. And ſo both of them with great confidence and feruour falling to their prayers, the ſight of one eye was reſtored to the blind, and a litle after, the other. Wherin God ſhewed the difference of the meritts of the interceſſors, in that the ſight reſtored to the ſecond eye, was very much clearer, purer, and ſharper then the other.
                  The ſainct one day entring ſecretly into the hoſpitall with two ſeruants to viſit the ſick, ſhe found att the dore a paralytique lying on the ground, who was alſo deafe and dumble. She hauing compaſsion of this poore creature, asked him with a low voice what he ayled. The ſick man that could not yeare her, moued his head and mouth as one dumbe; and making ſignes with his handes, the ſeruant of God with feruour of the holy Ghoſt ſayd vnto him: I command thee in the name of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, to tell me where is thy griefe: att which worde the paralytique aroſe on his feet and ſayd: I haue bin for many yeares both dumbe and lame as you ſee, and this is the griefe I had. This ſainct vtterly amazed att ſuch a miracle, ſpeedily retourned whence ſhe came, to auoyd the notice and obſeruation of the world.
                  As ſhe went an other time to viſitt the ſick, it happened that ſhe ſaw one ſo much decayed, as by reaſon of his extreme weaknes he could not eat. The S. prayed him to tell her what he deſired to eat. The ſick creature ſighing anſweared her, that he could willingly eat of ſome freſh-water fiſh: the vertuous Princeſſe, aſſuring him to procure it for him, left him much comforted, and preſently ſent a ſeruant of the hoſpitall to gett ſuch fiſh for the ſick man. But retourning he aduertiſed her that the riuer being frozen, there was no meane to haue any. Which this compaſsionate mother of the poore vnderſtanding, hauing confidence in God, and being well inſtructed by the holy Ghoſt, tooke a baſon in her hand, and went incontinently to a fountaine cloſe by the hoſpitall, wherinto hauing dipped her baſon ſhe drew it out full of water and fiſh, which with great pleaſure ſhe boiled, and gaue to the ſick party that was halfe dead, who did eat with ſuch appetite,

that a litle after he aroſe from his bed ſound, and gaue thanckes to almighty God.

                  THE XVI. CHAPTER.
                  THis holy Princeſſe had ordinarily reuelations and viſitations of her beloued IESVS CHRIST, by his moſt feruēt loue wherwith ſhe was wounded. Being in the Church one day in the lent, ſhe ſo ſetled and fixed her eyes on the altare, that ſhe made it appeare that ſhe there ſaw the preſence of the diuine maieſty, ſo remayning many howers receauing celeſtiall reuelations. Retourning to her ſelfe, ſhe was cōſtrayned by ſo great weaknes to reſt her head on the lappe of one of her ſeruantes, and ſo remayning a while, ſhe began to behold the heauen att a window, diſcouering ſuch a ioy in her countenance, that it enforced her to breake out into a merueillous laughter: and a litle after this laughter tourned into weeping, then againe openning her eyes ſhe ſhewed the like ſignes of ioy as before, and ſhutting them ſhe began againe to weep, thus continuyng without ſpeech till Compline. And then ſhe began to ſay. O my God: if thy holy will be to remaine with me, I moſt humbly beſeech thee to beleeue that I affect not nor deſire any thing more paſsionatly then to remayne eternally with thy diuine maieſty. Her companiōs hauing prayed her to tell them for the glory of God and the edification of their ſoules, what ſhe had ſeene, ſhe ſayd: my beloued ſiſters, I haue ſeene heauen open, and my Lord IESVS CHR. benignely bowing vnto me, &amp; ſhewing vnto me his holy gracious countenance. Whiles I beheld him, I was filled with incomprehēſible ioy, but not ſeeing him I was oppreſſed with ineſtimable griefe: therfore did I ſo bitterly weepe. And therfore God ha
                        •
                     ing compaſsion of me he againe cōforted and reioyced me with remonſtrance of his glorious face repleniſhed with ineſſable ſplendour, who asking me if I would remayne with him, I anſweared as you haue hea d. Her companions further prayed her to impart vnto them the reuelation ſhe had a litle before being before the altare. She anſweared: I may not tell you what I haue ſeene: yet I tell you I ſaw a merueillous matter of almighty God, &amp; my hart was filled with his ioyful &amp; gracious viſitation. This S. was ſo viſited of God in diuers manners, though ſhe reuealed nothing to her cōpanions therof, nor what ſhe knew to be the wil of God, who ſoueth the ſecrecy of his friendes. Our Redeemer would manifeſt the feruent charity of this bleſſed S. hearing her prayers by diuers effects, wherof we will heere record the two examples following.

It happened one night as ſhe slept that her mother appeared vnto her in viſion, on her knees in this ſort entreating her: alas my daughter, remember the paines I endured in thy birth, and pray for me, for thou muſt know I ſuffer extreme torment for hauing liued too negligently, &amp; not done penance for my ſinnes. The S. with this complaintive voice awaking, and touched and moued with compaſsion towardes her mother, ſhe fell on her knees and made her prayer to God, demaunding mercy of him for her mother. And after a long and ſeruent prayer ſhe fel a sleep, and an other time ſaw her mother in viſion with a ioyfull countenance, who ſayd: My daughter I am by thy prayers, deliuered of the paines wherwith I was tormented in purgatory, and am now goeing to heauen.
                  This ſaynt ſeeing a yong man very ſenſuall and full of vanity, had pitty of him, and prayed for him, whome alſo ſhe perſuaded to pray to God for himſelfe, wherto he accorded. So whiles they both prayed, the yong man began to cry out: Madame, pray no more for me: pray no more, forbeare if you pleaſe. Which the S. hearing, ſhe redoubled the feruour of her prayers, and the yong man began againe to cry lowder: Madame, pray no more for me, I am all burned: which exteriourly appeared: for all his body did ſmoake by the extreme ſweat wherin he was, which made him tremble, lift vp his armes, and his countenance to faile. They that found him there, touching his fleſh, could not endure their handes on it: his cloathes were al wet with the exceſsiue ſweat that bathed him, and therfore he ſtil encreaſed his cryes, ſaying that he burned. But the prayer of the ſainct being ended, this extreme &amp; viſible heat left the yong man, who retourning to the true knowledge of himſelfe, was then ſo purged and illuminated with diuine grace, that the entred into the Religious Order of Frere Minors, where he liued &amp; died piously: and ſo God ſhewed the force and vertue of the prayer of his holy ſeruant, not in theſe two examples only, but alſo in many others.

                  THE XVII. CHAPTER.
                  THe time of peregrinatiō of this holy widow being expired, our lord appeared vnto her in viſion, and very familierly ſayd: Mine elect, come, poſſeſſe the celeſtial habitation. In the morning ſhe related this newes to her companions: then by order ſhe receaued with an examplar deuotion all the ſacraments of the Church: after that, ſhe prepared what was neceſſary for her obſequies, and the night following tourning towardes a corner of the bed, they that were neere her heard a

cleare voice moſt ſweetly ſinging: wherupon one of her familier companions asked her who it was that did ſing there, and ſhe mildely anſweared that there was a litle bird, which by the pleaſing melody of his tune had induced her to ſing: then ſhe began to cry, auoyd, auoyd, auoyd wicked ſpiritt. So that the deuill being come to ſee if he could find any thing for him in this ſainct, vaniſhed att that voice. And ſhe hauing her countenance very ioyfull and her ſpiritt by prayer eleuated vnto God, demaunded if it were not yet midnight, att which houre our Sauiour voutſafed to be borne in the world, and layd in the cribbe: then ſaying that the houre was come when God would inuite her ſoule to the celeſtiall mariadge, ſhe ſodenly mounted vnto heauen. Her body hauing remayned foure dayes vnburyed, continued ſo beautifull and yelded ſo ſweet a ſauour, that it repreſented rather a glorious then mortall body. There appeared at that inſtant on the roofe of the church a great nōber of birdes of ſtrange kind, which did ſo ſweetly ſing, that they filled thoſe that ſaw and heard them with extreme admiratiō: this was to make knowne the feaſt which was celebrated in heauen att the entertaynment of this bleſſed ſoule: her funerals were filled with great clamours; complaintes and lamentations particulerly of the poore, for the death and abſence of her that loued, attended, and dreſſed them as amiably as if ſhe had bin the carnal mother to them all.

                  The life of the B. Elzearius of the third order of ſainct Francis, and S. Delphine his wife.
                  Of the ſanctity, mortification, abstinence, and virginity of S. Elzearius.
                  THE XVIII. CHAPTER.
                  ELzearius was Earle of Arian in Prouince, no leſſe generous and noble in vertues and ſanctity, then eminent &amp; famous in race &amp; generation; for the Ea
                        •
                     les of Arian his predeceſtors were of the moſt illuſtrious of Prouence. This nobleman from thirteen yeares of age accuſtomed to faſt often, and woare a cord girded on his fleſh, knotted with fiue knottes, which he vſed as a reſtraint and bridle to carnall ſenſuality, and as a ſecrett memory of the fiue woundes of our lord IESVS CHRIST. When he was ouer-wearyed with watching and was ouercome with neceſsity of sleep, he neuer putt of his cloathes to take his reſt: and by day woare an hair-cloth, therby to feele ſome affliction in his body both by day and night, conſidering that without afflictions the fruites of ſpirituall deſires cannot be obtayned. His rigours alſo ſerued him to repreſſe the cōcupiſcences &amp; ſtinges of the fleſh, and to obtayne the fruites of true wiſdome. His age encreaſing, he addicted himſelfe to a ſtricter rule of abſtinence, chaſticing his body by faſtes, to ſubiect it vnto the ſpiritt. He gaue vertuous and pious inſtructions to his family, that they might liue in the feare of God, and not iniury their neighbour, but might edifie him, and that God might by them be ſerued and honoured. This ſainct after his youth (though he had bin delicately nourriſhed) was a great friend vnto chaſtity, and ſo continued euen to his death, preſeruing in his ſoule and body the ineſtimable treaſure of virginity.
               
               
                  How ſainct Elzearius was maryed, and accorded with his wife, to conſerue their virginity.
                  THE XIX. CHAPTER.
                  S. Elzearius was maryed in his youth, vnto a gentlewoman of noble familie called Delphine, who had a like intention with her huſband to preſerue her virginity. She being paſt twelue yeares of age, and knowing ſhe ſhould ſhortly be deliuered and committed to Elzearious her Spouſe, began exceedingly to fea

Father, called Frere Philip Denguerre a man of notable piety, he gaue her full aſſeurance and ſatisfaction, with a prophetical ſpiritt telling her, that ſhe ſhould not only entierly obſerue her vow, but that her husbād and ſhe ſhould liue together chaſtly and ſo perſeuer to the end. And ſo the nuptiall ſolemnities being ended, they liued together twenty ſeauen yeares religiously and piously, vnder the ſhadow of the name of mariadge, very well vnited in ſpiritt, but remote from the vnion of the fleſh, preſeruing in this veſſell of earth, the ineſtimable treaſure of moſt precious chaſtity, a vertue not ſo much recommendable as rare, and ſo much more worthy to be imitated, att leaſt in part, as the contrary vice is damnable and ruinous.
               
               
                  Of the worthy and ſinguler vertues of S. Elzearius.
                  THE XX. CHAPTER.
                  THis holy man duely conſidering that the principall vertue which the ſeruant of God can haue, is the miſpriſe of himſelfe, and conſequently humility, and not worldly nobility: his ſpiritt could neuer be rayſed to vaine glory by the great ſubſtance, honours and puiſſance which the eminency of his houſe did yeld him. His wordes were gracious and pleaſing conformable to the ſpiritt that deliuered them: and the better to attaine to the perfect contempt of himſelfe, he would often, for the loue of IESVS CHRIST, waſh the ſoares and vlceres of leapers with his one handes, and ſerue them with gteat feruour of deuotion, and with ſuch charity, as if with his owne eyes he had ſeene and ſerued IESVS CHRIST himſelfe. He behaued himſelfe towardes his ſubiectes and vaſſals, ouer whome he had entier iuriſdiction, as a iuſt lord, iudgeing their cauſes with a ſeuere clemencie, as one that could not be drawne from the right courſe of iuſtice by feare, hatred, fauour or corruption. This holy man proceeded in all actions by the vertue of diſcretion, wherwith he ſo tēpered his worckes of mercy, that therin he with exceeding humility auoyded worldly glory and fauour: and as a valiant and perfect warryer, he neuer deſiſted from his firſt intē
                     tion: and as iuſt, he withall his induſtry ſhunned the occaſions of offending God. This ſeruant was ſo charitable and liberall to the poore, that neuer any demaunded of him an almoſe for the loue of God, but he gaue him a reward together with good wordes. All his care was to feed the hungry, to lodge pilgrimes, and haue care of poore ſick and forlorne creatures, as one that acknowledged the poore CHR. IES. in his poore creatures, &amp; in ſickneſſes, the painfull afflictions w
                        •
                     ich he endured for vs miſerable ſinners. And as he was repleniſhed with the loue of his

neighbours, no leſſe was he, but much more repleniſhed with the loue of IESVS CHRIST. And knowing that the edifice of vertues hath its end in the perfection of holy prayer, in regard that it is a conuerſation and familiarity with God, he applyed himſelfe with all his endeauour to prayer and contemplation: he alſo ſayd the canonicall houres with ſuch deuotion and attention, as if he had bin in the viſible preſence of IESVS CHRIST.
               
               
                  How S. Elzearius had the true vertue of patience: of his death and canonization, and the death of his wife.
                  THE XXI. CHAPTER.
                  THis inuincible Champion, was ſo armed with the precious armours of patience by the exerciſe of vertue, that, albeit he ſupported many thinges very difficult to endure, yet none could euer diſquiett him: ſo that he was neuer perceaued to be in choler, nor the leaſt iott remote from his ordinary mildnes. For he very patiently and humblie, ſupported and endured the iniu
                        •
                     yes and affiontes directly or indirectly offered vnto him, and was neuer heard to proceed out of his mouth any word but of praiſe and thanckesgiuing vnto God: he with ſuch ſweetnes and clemencie pardonned his ennemies whatſoeuer offence they commited againſt him, that he did not only make appeare that he was ſatissied and appeaſed, but proceeded in their behalfe as if there had neuer bin cauſe of diſcontentment.
                  Being att Paris, and hauing fore-knowledge of the houre of his death, he with great abondance of teares and exceeding deuotion made his cō
                     feſsion, then with much reuerence and in very exemplar manner receaued the ſacramentes of the church. And albeit his life and the Counteſſe his wiues were ſtored withall kind of vertues, yet in his laſt dayes ſpeaking of her, being vrged by the holy Ghoſt he vttered to thoſe preſent theſe wordes: The infidell man is ſanctified by the faithfull woman, whome I leaue a virgin in this mortall life, as I receaued her a virgin and vnſpotted.
                  This holy Confeſſour of IESVS CHRIST, changed this life for a better the yeare of grace 1327. Father Francis of Maronis, a famous preacher and Doctour was preſent att his death. The very daye of his departure he appeared in all glory vnto his wife, (who was them in her Countie in Prouence) to whome he vttered theſe wordes of the Pſalmiſt: The ſnare is broaken, and we are deliuered, and ſo without any other word he vaniſhed. The Conteſſe the ſame day recounted to all her company the death of her husband, it being the 27. day of September.

He was buryed in the church of the Cordeliers att Paris clothed in the habitt of the third Order, and the ſame yeare his body was translated into Prouence to the Couent of Apte, in which his ſanctity was by many miracles diuulged; for which he was by the Apoſtolike ſea canonized. His feaſt is celebrated the 27. of September:
                  The Counteſſe Delphine his wife, liued many yeares after him perſeuering in piety: being dead ſhe was buryed by her husband, hauing the the habitt of the Frere Minors, as a diſciple of the holy Father S. Francis, and of the third Order.
                  Att the death of this Counteſſe and till her body was enterred, a moſt ſweet harmony was heard in the aire, as they haue teſtified and aſſured who were neere her body. It is piously beleeued that they were Angels ſinging as true friendes of virginall purity. Our Lord wrought many miracles as well in the life time, as att the death of this holy woman, and in ſuch quantity, as there is no doubt but that our lord had canonized her in heauen.

This holy man was the ſonne of a very rich &amp; vertuous man, by whoſe good example he was from his tender infancie a patterne of commendable conuerſation. His Father ſent him to ſtudy humanity att Paris, thence to Orleans to ſtudy the Canon and Ciuill law, but much more did he profitt in diuine wiſdome: for there manifeſting his doctrine he layd open to many the true knowledge and aſſured way of iuſtice. And being to retourne to his Father, the Biſhop of Triquet hauing heard the fame of his excellent vertues and ſanctity, made him his Officiall or commiſſary, with very ample aucthority. And albeit the holy man withall his power withſtood the acceptance of this cha dge: yet was he att lenght conſtrained therevnto. He with ſuch prudenceRemarckable proceeding in a man of iust

                  A litle after by diuine prouidence he became Prieſt, in which miniſtery he offered his body a liuely ſacrifice vnto almighty God. His habit was

then, according to his quality, common, decent and modeſt. But vnder he woare a very ſharp hayr-cloth, Whe

                  THE XXIII. CHAPTER.
                  THis holy man did neuer feed on delicate meates, but ſuch as were very groſſe: which he did to reſerue of his reuenue wherwith to reliue many poore people. On faſting dayes commanded by the Church he vſed only bread and water, &amp; ordinarily did with great abſtinence faſt the wedneſday and ſaterday. He had cuſtomarily ſtrangers and pilgrimes in his houſe: he was very dilligent in the practiſe of the worckes of mercy: he entertayned poore people, and particulerly the ſick and lame, with exceeding pitty and compaſsion and conuerſed with them ſo mildly and familiarly as if they had bin his brethren, he ſerued them and made their beddes, waſhed their feet, and did them all other ſeruices that they could need. Being no leſſe carefull to adminiſter vnto them the ſpirituall food of the word of God, then the corporall, he made them notable exhortations, wherin he multiplyed the talent of the Euangelicall doctrine to thoſe that were vnder his chardge.The giftes of. S. Yues. He was very prompt in according diſſentions and procuring of peace with all perſons. He had the grace to conuert ſinners to pennance. He was ſo addicted to prayer and contemplation, that he would ſometimes neglect to take his ordinary repaſt and dyett. And one time he continued fiue whole dayes in prayer in his chamber, without asking or being offered

him any thing to eat. And yet when he came forth his countenā
                     ce was ſo pleaſing, ioyful, and vermilliō as if he had bin pampered with moſt exquiſite meates.
                  As he celebrated maſſe with great feruour, ſo did he therin receaue of God notable feelinges and graces, as one day did appeare: for as he eleuated the moſt ſacred ſacrament, there diſcended from heauen an admirable ſplendour and brightnes, which enuironned the ſacred hoſt together with the chalice. He red the canonicall houres with admirable attention &amp; deuotion, and did alwayes riſe att midnight to ſay his Matins. He diuided the office into all the houres of the dayes, in imitation of the Prophett

                  THis holy Religious being complete in the perfectiō of all vertues, &amp; exceeding deuout vnto IESVS CHRIST, very auſtere towardes himſelfe, &amp; extreme curteous and charitable towards others, as he was by diuine grace, of a ſinguler life and admirable in the worckes of charity, ſo was he honoured of God in this life by merueillous actions &amp; miracles. For he expelled the euill ſpirittes out of humane bodyes, he cured all kind of diſeaſes: Wherin was accompliſhed the propheſie of his mother, who confidently affirmed that, he being a child, it was reuealed vnto her that he ſhould proue a ſainct.
                  The day of his death was reuealed vnto him three weekes before he dyed. And thervpon he ſayd to his people, that he was ſhortly by the diuine will to depart out of this life. And ſo the three weekes being expired being fortified with the ſacraments of the Church, making a end anſwearable to the worth of his life, he yelded his ſoule vnto God the yeare, 1303. the 19. of May, &amp; 50. of his age. His feaſt is celebrated the ſame month &amp; day, and in ſome places the 27. day of October, by reaſon of his translation.

authors are recorded. Among the SS. of this Order is reckoned S. Lewis king of France, and queene Blanch his mother who was daughter to the king of Caſtille.

Which, if they haue not obtayned heere below among earthly people, they enioy it with far greater glory among the Angels &amp; SS. in the celeſtiall kingdome; by which fruit it appeareth that this holy confraternity of Penitents, inſtituted by the holy Father S. Francis, was aſsiſted by the holy Ghoſt, to the end that Chriſtians of free eſtate, maryed perſons, and widoes that cannot ſupport the burden of Religion, may in their houſes produce fruites worthy of penance, to the ſaluation of their ſoules and for the loue of IESVS CHRIST.

Francis in their place, which I ſuppoſe the author omitted, becauſe wanting knowledge of them att firſt, he would not afterward take the paine to change the methode which he had with ſo much labour begun, though we, for the glory of God only and your contentment, haue willingly vndertaken the ſame. Know then, that,
                  The firſt and ſecond chapter are placed after the laſt chap. of the ſecond booke. The 3. chap. after the 27. of the ſecond booke. The 4. chap. after the 30. of the ſecond booke.

And albeit few were found to whome theſe exhortations were gratefull, yet they mett with curious perſons that made ſo many demandes, as they were much troubled to giue them anſweare: As whēce they were, whence they came?

Others ſeeing them ſo diſguiſed, and hearing them ſpeake with ſuch ſimplicity, reputed them fooles, couſening or deluding companiōs, and would not admitt them into their houſes, for feare thy would robbe them: whence it often arriued that none hauing compaſsion to harbour them, they ſlept in the church porches or vnder pent-houſes: &amp; ſo perſeuering, by their example of pouerty and humility, they att length moued the moſt obdurat harts to compaſsion and deuotion, &amp; left many places edified in the feare of God. And the
                        •
                     fore the reputation of their vertues encreaſing, they daily produced ſinguler fruites of good example, among which this is one which we now intend to relate.
                  It happened one time that two new Religious, but true children of the holy Father ſaint Francis, trauelling through a contry which they neither knew, nor they knowne to any, they came to a caſtell that was a retuge to certaine theeues, of whome was captaine a noble man

of great family, but of moſt vicious life: whither being come, weary, feeble, and halfe ſtarued with hungar and cold, not able to paſſe farther, they there ſtayed, without dreaming what danger might there befall them, and ſent to pray this tyrant, to entertayne, lodge, and refreſh them that night, for the loue of our Lord IESVS CHRIST. This noble man by diuine inſpiration, willingly receaued them into his houſe, and commanded incontinently a good fire to be made them, then cauſed them to cat with his people. At which time, one of the Religious that was a Prieſt, and had a ſpeciall grace in preaching well, perceauing that att this table there was no ſpeech but of robbing, killing and pilling, each one vaunting of his villanies, and glorying in his murders and theftes committed, the good ſeruant of God reſolued, after ſupper to make them an exhortation in the behalfe of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, with the greateſt feruour he could procure. And ſo, grace being ſayd, vnable any longer to retaine his zealous ſpiritt, he addreſſed himſelfe to the tyrant and ſayd: Hauing receaued of you ſuch a charity for the loue of God, we ſhould proue too ingratefull if we did not beſeech the diuine maieſty to reward you for vs, and did not endeauour to requite you by ſome documents conformable to our pouerty, that may benifitt your ſoules and your peoples, whome I beſeech you heere to aſſemble together, we deſiring to giue to you all, a ſpirituall refection for the corporal which you haue giuen vs. This noble man hauing conuocated all his people, and they hauing ſetled themſelues to heare the ſermon, the Religious began with exceeding feruour to diſcourſe of the glory of Paradiſe, in theſe termed: My beloued Brethren in CHRIST IESVS, if the eternall felicities, for which God hath created vs, were knowne vnto vs, and that we did often well conſider them, what paine would we not vndertake to ſerue him, and neuer to offend him, for feare to looſe that ioy and glory without end, for ſo baſe a trifle as the world? that ſweet ſociety of the Angels? that life and ſecurity of the bleſſed? that glorious ſatiety of the elect? that ſupreme light without night and darcknes? that perpetuall peace and amity without any feare or perturbance? and all the happines that we can deſire, free and ſecure from all diſaſter, with that diuine fountaine of the preſence and glorious communication of the eternall God? And ſith that man (ſo blinded and miſerable) for ſo baſe and loathſome a thing, ſo ſhort and of ſo ſclender value as is ſinne, will looſe ſuch innumerable and infinite felicities: he ſhall deſeruedly goe into hell, there to endure eternall hungar, thirſt, cold, all kind of torment, and perpetuall affliction in the company of cruell deuils, ſerpents and dragons, where is a continuall death without end, and without hope of life,

with palpable darcknes. And finally greater miſeries then we can imagine, conſidering that there is nothing but howlinges, lamentations, deſpaires and eternall torments, and all euill voyd of all good, wherinto my brethren you haue merited to be throwne and impriſoned, for the ſinnes which you haue perpetrated

                        •
                     ck. Therfore my beloued brethren, doe I admoniſh you in the behalfe of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, who for you was faſtened on the hard wood of the croſſe, and pardonned the theefe, to giue vs confidē
                     ce of his mercy: and doe counſaile you by the 
                        •
                     euerence of the omnipotencie of the Creatour of althinges, not to make ſhip wrack and exchaung of the celeſtiall and eternall richeſſe, for the briefe pleaſure of ſinnes, which as you experience, vaniſh as a ſhadow. Retourne then with great promptitude vnto God, to the end he thruſt you not into hell, denying you time and ſpace to doe penance: ſo many yeares hauing fleeted away wherin he hath ſo patiently expected you, though you haue giuen no ſigne of regarding it. This Religious vttered theſe thinges and much more with ſuch a zeale, that they pearced the hart of the Tyrant, who being touched by the holy Ghoſt, and already ſtricken with contrition, fell to the ground together with all his people, bittetly lamenting their ſinnes. They ſhewed ſignes of penitence, and after many teares the tyrant with great inſtancie required the Religious to ſett them in the way to ſaue their ſoules, ſith God had ſent him hither for their ſaluation. And the Religious aduiſed them to make a generall confeſsion of all their ſin

                      the holy places, and that you mortifie your fleſh by faſtes, watchings and prayers, giuing many almoſes and performing other worckes of piety. But you muſt begin with ſatisſaction, reſtoring what you ini

                     aine. Wherto he anſweared: Father, I am content to ſatisfie whatſoeuer I am boūd vnto. But becauſe I was neuer out of this cont

                     y, nor can write, not read, no not the Pater noſter, nor can faſt, I beſeech you for the loue of God to giue me ſome other penance that I may be able to performe. The Religious replyed: I will for the loue of God doe penance and pray vnto IESVS CHRIST for you, that your ſoule be not loſt. I will not for the preſent giue you other penance then for mortification, your ſelfe to bring vs hither a litle ſtraw wheron to repoſe our ſelues. The tyrant becomming a lambe preſently brought ſtraw for the Religious to reſt on, and

prepared their place himſelfe: Then conſidering with himſelfe the diſcourſe that the Religious had made him, and how ſpeedily he had conuerted him to penitence, he reputed him a ſainct, and reſolued to watch him all that night to ſee what he would doe. Now the Religious att his houre layd himſelfe to repoſe, and when he thought they all slept, he aroſe &amp; went out of the houſe, to doe penance for the penitent as he had promiſed him. Lifting then his handes to heauen, he with many teares demāded pardon of almighty God for the ſinner, &amp; praying with exceeding feruour, his body was eleuated frō the earth the hight of a tour, &amp; in that manner, bitterly bewayled the ſoule of that noble man, begging pardon of IESVS CHRIST for his offences in ſuch ſort and with a charity ſo paſsionate, that he merited to be heard, as appeareth by what enſueth: for the penitent hauing ſeene and heard all this, not without exceeding terrour, contrition and abundance of teares, accompanyed with conſolation, perceauing with what feruour the ſeruant of God offered his prayers to the diuine Maieſty for the ſaluation of his ſoule: very early in the morning he ſell att the feet of the Religious, praying him with great compunction to ſetle him in the direct way of ſaluation, he being ready to execute whatſoeuer he ſhould command him. The Religious hauing conſailed him to ſell all he had, he did his vtmoſt to make reſtitution where he was obliged, and according to Euangelicall coū
                     ſaile gaue the reſt to the poore: then offered him
                        •
                     elfe to God becōming a Frere Minor, where he perſeuered in vertues and piously ended his life: all his people were alſo conuerted and did penance. So the holy ſimplicity of this Religious produced a merueillous fruit, not preaching of high and ſubtill matters, nor with elegant wordes, but only of the paines of hell and glory of Paradiſe; as he had bin inſtructed by the holy Father ſainct Francis.

                  AN Engliſh Frere Minor and Doctour of diuinity, preaching in the Monaſtery of S. Damian, where S. Clare was Abbeſſe in the preſece of holy Br. Giles he as a great freind of humility would make proofe therof in this Preacher, and ſo in the middeſt of his ſermon, he willed him to be ſilent becauſe himſelfe would preach, and the

diuine incontinently held his peace, and Brother Giles with exceeding feruour of ſpiritt and to the great amazement and edification of the hearers vttered matters of great ſublimity and eminency touching almighty God: then tourning towardes the Diuine, he willed him to proceed in his ſermon: which S. Clare perceauing, ſhe was exceeding ioyfull &amp; ſayd: This day is accompliſhed one of the defines of S. Francis, who would often ſay: I deſire that my Religious be ſo humble, as that a Doctour in diuinity goeing into the pulpitt, if a ſimple lay Brother make a motion to preach, the Doctour ſhall gi

                  Of a very terrible accident vnto a Nouice, cloathed by S. Antony of Padua.
                  THE XV. CHAPTER.
                  THere was a worldly man whoſe profeſsion was to follow the warres, in which practiſe he did much miſchiefe: this mā induced by the deuil came to the bleſſed Father S. Antony of Padua, then Guardian of the Monaſtery of Limoges, and beſought him to giue him the habit of the Frere Minors, affirming a deſire to ſerue God therin. The Sainct as zealous of the ſaluation of ſoules, after diuers and ſeuerall conferences with him, and alwayes finding him firme in his pretended holy purpoſe, heard his confeſsion: then hauing piously admoniſhed him to doe penance for his ſinnes he gaue him the habitt, and had a particuler care of his deportements: but this lewd wretch hauing promiſed the deuill to ſerue him with fidelity in whatſoeuer vocation he ſhould take vpon him, and neuer to diſcouer his intention to any perſon, did very ſtrongly obſerue this conuention; and in his generall confeſsion, 
                        •
                     ſing his vtmoſt diſsimulation did conceale this ſecrett of the deuils from ſainct Antony, and indeed did alwayes in his hart excogitate matters directly oppoſite to his ſaluation, as his maſter the deuill had taught him. So that it is eaſy to iudge that God had not drawne him to Religion: but rather ſome diſcontentment, in that his worldly affaires ſucceeded not as he wiſhed, and hearing ſainct Antony preach, he became Religious, yet omitted not to hope and expect ſome benefitt from the deuill. Sainct Antony as a faithfull ſeruant of God, with exceeding feruour made him many remonſtrances, to enduce him to renounce the world with all his hart, to reſiſt chaſtice his fleſh, to ſhunne the deuill, and to withſtand all his temptations; and to this effect gaue him meanes to performe a ſharp and rigourous penāce for his

enormous ſinnes. But this Nouice in all ſuch vertuous and pious actions did diſſemble, as hauing no affectiō thervnto. This wretched Nouice thē goeing one day out of his cell, which was on a litle hill ſeparated from the others, ſaw a very faire horſe well harniſed, with a complet a mour vpon him and a cloke bagge on him behinde: which att firſt ſight and apprehenſion amazed him; but after hauing without feare beheld the horſe, he had a deſire to ſee what was in the cloke bagge, and to that end layd hold on the horſe by the raines and drew him a ſide, where hauing ſearched the ſayd cloake bagge, he found ſtoare of mony and a ſaire ſute of apparell, ſo that hauing found a horſe, apparell, armour and mony, he reputed himſelfe moſt happily fourniſhed withall that he deſired: whervpon ſhaking off his Frere Minors habitt, &amp; putting on his worldly attyre, and armour of a ſoldier, he mounted on horſeback, and ſo ſecretly rode away that none perceaued him. The ſame day he made ſuch ſpeed that he arriued att Bourges in Berry, where alighting late att an Inne, the houre of ſoupper being come, he ſett himſelfe att table, and was attended by the daughter of the Hoſt, who ſo well pleaſed his fancy that he demanded her of her Father in Mariage, and to induce his conſent ſhewed him the mony he had in his cloackbag. The Hoſt att the ſight of ſo much mony was tempted with auarice, graunted his daughter to be his wife, and left them to complement together. The deuill then preſently leauing the figure of a horſe and hauing putt on the ſhape of a man, came about midnight and knocked att the dore of that Inne, where being entred, drew the maſter of the houſe a ſide to ſpeake with him, ſeining himſelfe iealous of his honour, and ſayd: Syr, is it not true that you haue conſented to mary your daughter to a ſtranger, it is ſayd the hoſt, the deuill replyed: know then that he whome you haue accepted for your ſonne in law is a Religious man, who as alewd fellow hath deluded you and rauiſhed your daughter. Therfore, ſith there is no other remedy, follow my counſaile: goe whiles it is night he sleeping in his bed, but ſo warily that he may not heare you, and you ſhall find his head bare, ſhauen with a croune in manner of a Religious: ſo that it prouing infallible what I tell you, cutt his throat, and take his mony withall that he hath, wherwith you ſhall much better mary your daughter. Beſides, there is no cauſe of feare, for this fellow is not knowne in theſe quarters nor in any part of France: This diſcourſe putt the 
                        •
                     oſt into an extreme anguiſh; but being at length ouercome by the paſsion of choller, and encouraged by the deuill, he reſolued to murder his new ſonne in law, if he found it true which his pretēded friēd had told him, whom he prayed to ſtay till he had effected his counſaile, to aſsiſt him to bury the body, promiſing him a ſhare of the mony wherto the deuil accorded ſo this Hoſt wēt ſo dextrously into the chāber of the

nouice, that he found him profoundly ſleeping, and halfe naked, and perceauing the religious croune conformable to what was told him, he would expect no farther proofe, but eſteeming himſelfe diſhonoured and deceaued, drew out his dagger and cutt his throat: which done, retourning to the place where he left his pretended friend that had thus counſailed him, he could not find him in all the houſe, then goeing to ſeaze on the cloak bagge, the armour, and apparell of the dead man, he could find nothing, nor the horſe in the ſtable: and therfore preſently ſuſpected it to be a diabolicall illuſion, and with the moſt ſecreſie he could, buryed the body, then went and made his conſeſsion to S. Antony who then preached in the ſame towne of Bourges, who a litle after publikely diuulged the ſame, to make appeare how dangerous it is to run out of the true way of the feare of God, who permitteth them that wilbe faithfull to the deuill and perſeuer in their ſinnes to the end (thincking to deceaue his diuine Maieſty) to end their dayes moſt miſerably.

                  Of the humility and deuotion of Brother Iames.
                  THE XIX. CHAPTER.
                  BRother Iames a gentleman and much honoured in the world, becomming a Frere Minor, was ſo deuout and ſpirituall, that in his prayer he was often rapt in extaſie, wherin he was very frequently viſited of God. He perceauing what graces our Lord had endued him with all in prayer, entreated his Guardian, the better to exerciſe himſelfe in this grace, that he would pleaſe to diſpenſe with him for affaires of the kitchen and other offices, wherin, being a lay Brother, he was in that Couent employed, which was graunted him, to the end he might with more repoſe and liberty apply himſelfe to contemplation. Br. Iames being thus freed from the kitchen, and other offices of the houſe, loſt all the graces which almighty God had giuen him in prayer. Which hauing experienced, he with abondance of teares beſought his Guardian to retourne him to his former employments: wherin our lord againe reſtored him his grace. He thenceforward ſo profited in prayer ioyned with humility, that on Chriſtmas day (to communicate timely and to continue all the morning in the Church to heare maſſe and the diuine ſeruice) he prepared the dinner for the Religious in the night, and left it ouer the fire. Now the Guardian ſeeing him continue ſo long

time in prayer &amp; ſeruing att maſſe, went admiring to the kitchen to ſee if he had made any preparation for dinner. But he found the pots ouertourned and broaken and ſaw that the cattes had eaten the meat: then preſently goeing to Brother Iames, he willed him to haſten into the kitchen. Which he did, and finding the pots broken, the pottage ſpilt, the meat deuoured, and euery thing ouerthrowne, he was exceedingly grieued. Neuertheles falling on both his knees, he with abondance of reares beſought the omnipotent bounty, to aſsiſt in this his affliction. The ſequell was admirable: for his prayer being ended, the pots were reioyned and filled againe with pottage and meat like vnto that which he had prepared, as if it neuer had bin att all touched. Wherein almighty God would make appeare to this Religious, how much humility and prayer ioyned together are gratefull vnto him.

                  Of a Guardian that had litle charity, and how almighty God did chastice him.
                  THE XXI. CHAPTER.
                  THer was a pious lay Religious that endured extreme torments in his feet by meanes of the gout that exceedingly afflicted him: but in the winter time more then elſe, and yet did he not omitt to labour in the garden in the coldeſt ſeaſon of the yeare. Notwithſtanding his indiſcreet Guardiāſeeing him att night by the fire to annoynt his feet with an oyntment (though the rigorous cold was cauſe ſufficient without any other infirmity, to warme himſelfe) he cō
                     manded him from the fire, and not to burne ſo much wood. Wherto the poore Religious anſweared, that he had no other meane to eaſe the extreme torments he endured procured him by the gout, then to warme his feet and to annoynt them with that oyntment, which was giuen him for very remedious therunto, &amp; beſought him for the loue of God and S. Francis not to take it ill. But the Guardian would not heare him: ſo that the Religious retyred doubly afflicted vnto his cell, beſeeching God to aſsiſt and ayd him with his grace. But the omnipotent did not long deferre to doe vengeance: For he ſent the Guardiam the ſame torments which the poore Religious endured, wherin finding no other remedy then to warme him by a great fire, he began to acknowledge his litle charity and confeſſed his fault, ſaying: My God haue pitty on me if thou pleaſe, and aſsiſt me with thy mercy, for I acknowledge my deſert of this torment, ſith I haue

bin cruell towardes my ſimple Brother, depriuing him of his aſſured remedy in his neceſsity. And ſending for him, he ſayd: Brother, warme your ſelfe both day and night according to the need you haue. For I am aſſured the fire is a great helpe and eaſe vnto your torments. This Guardian hauing done penance was in few dayes after cured by meanes of this charity.

                     l ty which two ſeuerall times the deuill vſed to reduce the Frere Minors from the ſtrictnes of their pouerty.
                  THE XXIV. CHAPTER.
                  THe Frere Minors of thoſe primitiue dayes liued att Mont Alue
                        •
                     ne in the ſame ſpirituall tranquillity and pouerty as S. Francis had inſtituted and inſtructed them. The deuil vnable to ſupport ſuch a vertue of prayer, abſtinence and auſterity of life, nor able to diſquiett the Religious, by deſires of ſubſtance and temporal affaires, inuented a new ſubtility to induce them to remitt and leſſen the auſterity and perfection of the ſpirituall life wherin they perſeuered, which was thus: There was in thoſe partes a very rich gentleman, that had no deuotion to the Frere Minors, nor euer gaue them any almoſe. The deuil taking on him humane ſhape became his ſeruant and ſo diligently ſerued him, that he ſhortly committed vnto him the gouernment of his houſe and the abſolute diſpoſition and management of his affaires, following his counſaile in all his buſineſſe. Now as they one day diſcourſed together, the deuil began to prayſe the Frere Minors of Mont Aluerne, ſaying that they were SS▪ and that whoſoeuer were charitable in almoſe towardes them did much merit with almighty God. Then did he alleadge vnto him ſo many pregnant reaſons, that he wrought the gentleman to be ſo deuout and affected to thoſe Religious, as that he almoſt euery day ſent them for almoſe, bread, fleſh, fiſh, fruit, and all this in ſuch abōdance, that the Religious who formerly liued auſterely began to liue bountifully &amp; royally with this almoſe procured them by the deuill. Which being perceaued by certaine good ancient Religious, who acknowledged the ſpiritual detriment that arriued vnto them, one of them began to conſider on ſome meanes to remedy the ſame, &amp; therfore he recōmended himſelfe to God and beſought him, not to permit his ſeruants to fa
                        ••
                      into ſuch relaxation in their manner of life. And ſo being touched with the ſpirit of God he wēt with his cōpanion to the houſe of this gentlemā then benefactour, with whome hauing diſcourſed of diuers matters touching almighty God, he demaunded of him who had induced him to ſuch deuotion

towardes them as to beſtow on them ſuch liberall almoſe, conſidering that a litle before he was nothing charitable towardes them att all. Whereto the gentleman anſweared that among infinite ſeruices which one of his ſeruants had don &amp; ſtill continued, he reputed this the principall, that he had wrought him to be affected vnto them for the benefit of his ſoule. And had ſuch a ſpecial care to put him in minde to ſend them ſome bountifull almoſe, that there was neuer day wherin he failed to procure the performāce therof. This Father admiring the exceeding charity of this ſeruant, prayed the gentleman that he might ſee him: whome cauſing diuers times to be called, there was no meanes to make him appeare before this holy Religious. But being att lēgth thereunto enforced, as ſoone as this good Religious ſaw him he knew who he was. And he ſeeing himſelfe diſcouered, vaniſhed, and was neuer after ſeene in that place. The Religious then hauing diſcouered the ſubtility of the deuill, and procured the gentlemans promiſe to ſend no more almoſe to the monaſtery, he reformed it, and reſtored it to their former abſtinence and rigour of ſpiritual life.
                  The deuill inuented an other deluſion in Portugall in the Couent of Alenquer, to diſturbe &amp; diſquiett the Religious of that place. For hauing aſſumed the humane ſhape of an excellent Phiſicion, Surgion, or Apothicary, he went to the Couēt to demaūd the habit of a Frere Minor, which he did with great inſtance and feyned deuotion, pretending to ſerue God therin. Hauing receiued the habitt, and being Nouice, he dreſſed, aſsiſted and attended the ſick Religious with ſo extraordinary a charity &amp; prōptitude, and therin was ſo diligent, and alſo in aſsiſting att diuine ſeruice and prayer, where he appeared ſo deuout and in althings fained himſelfe ſo hūble, that the Religious were exceedingly pleaſed in him, in whome thy perceaued nothing deſeruing admonition, but that he alwayes made ſome excuſe or cuaſion to ſhunne the ſacred communion with the other Nouices, lay Brothers and other Religious that were not Prieſtes, ſo that her neuer communicated all the time of his being there. This fained Religious began of himſelfe to publiſh vnto ſeculer parſons his qualities and ſciences. So that there was alwayes ſome one att the Couent dore that demauded certaine water, receites or medicines for diuers infirmities, he hauing already the fame of an excellent Phiſician. Wherwith the Religious were ſo diſturbed that the Guardian who was one of the diſciples of Saint Francis, vppon this inquietude gaue himſelfe to prayer, to know the will of God in this behalfe: where it was reuealed vnto him, that the Phiſician was a deuill, and had putt himſelfe among them to diſturbe them; wherupon he tooke the habitt f

                  How our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, by the merittes of S. Francis, conſerued certaine Religious in the Order.
                  THE XXV. CHAPTER.
                  AYong Religious being profeſſed was ſo tempted by the deuill, that he would needes leaue the habitt: yet would he not doe it without the conſent of ſainct Francis, of whom he demanded leaue to depart. But he denyed him in theſe wordes: Brother, ſith our lord by his piety hath deliuered you from the perils and miſeries of the world, you may by no meanes retourne againe therto. This Religious being yet ſtill tempted to leaue the Order, went to the Pope to gett diſpenſation of his Holineſſe. But there alſo finding denyall, he of him ſelfe caſt off the habitt, then wandring alone in the holdes he met a man naked hauing ſuch woundes as our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST receaued for vs in his feet, handes and ſide, who ſhewed him his woundes: wheratt the yong man being vtterly amazed, asked him who he was &amp; how he had receaued thoſe woundes ſo like to thoſe of our Lord IESVS CHRIST? Wherto our Sauiour anſweared: It is my ſelfe that haue bin thus wounded for thee, and for mankinde, and yet thou wilt abandon me to follow the world, behould theſe woundes which I haue endured for thee. And at al times that the deuill ſhal tēpt thee cauſing thee to endure ſome contradiction againſt thy deſire and taſt, fix thine eyes on theſe woundes and thou ſhalt find conſolation. Which ſayd he incontinently vaniſhed, and the yong man changing his purpoſe retourned to S. Francis, to whome he acknoweleged his fault, and hauing obtayned pardon, he recounted to all the Religious what he had ſeene, and piously perſeuered in the Order to the end.
                  An other Religious was tempted with deſire to viſite his kinred, and leaue being refuſed him by the Prouinciall, he ſayd to himſelfe: I will goe, and they ſhall ſee who can force me to retourne: and preſently without further licence departed. The Religious followed him far, moſt inſtantly praying him to retourne; But reiecting their prayers ad admonitiōs and proceeding in his iorney, he was a litle after ſurpriſed with ſuch an extreme deſire of ſleepe, that he could not poſsibly reſiſt it, and ſo falling to the ground he fell a sleep. And preſently he had this viſion: S. Francis (who then liued and was far diſtant from thoſe quarters) appeared vnto him, ſaying: how haſt thou dared to miſpriſe the yoke of

obedience retourne incontinētly to the Couent whence thou art fled. And becauſe he would not goe, S. Francis ſtroake him ſoundly with a wand which he had in his hand, ſo that awaking he ſtill felt the paine of the blowes receiued; whervpon he ſpeedily retourned to his Couent, where his Brethren hauing very charitably receaued him, he related vnto him how S. Francis had enforced him to retourne.
                  Sometime after a yong gentleman of very delicat conſtitution being admitted into the Order of the Frere Minors, began (by diabolicall tēptation) to haue his habitt in ſuch horrour, that he ſeemed to carry on him a moſt baſe and abhominable burden. This irckſomnes of religion encreaſing in him, he reſolued to abādon it and to retourne to the world. Now his Maſter of the Nouiciat had taught him, that as often as he paſt before the altare of the moſt ſacred ſacrament, he ſhould vncouer his head, bend his knees, &amp; croſsing his armes, lowly encline towardes the ground. Which hauing done the ſame morning that he had purpoſed to depart, he was as it were conſtrayned to kneele before the altare, and att the inſtant had this merueillous viſion: He ſaw an infinite multitude of Religious that paſſed two and two in proceſsion before the altare, cloathed in moſt rich and gorgious attire, hauing their face, and handes, and whatſoeuer exterio
                        •
                     ly appeared of their bodyes more glittering then the ſunne, with a coūtenance and geſture extremely ioyfull, and more exceſsiue then can be imagined, who did ſing moſt melodiously. In the fore-front marched two Religious more notable then the others, ſo gloriously attired that they aſtoniſhed the beholders. Towardes the end of this proceſsion came a Religious in habitt of perticuler glory, who was honoured by the others as one newly entertayned into their companye. The nouice not knowing the ſignification of this proceſsion prayed the hind-moſt to tell him who they were, who tourning towardes him, ſayd: We are your Brethren Minors that now come from Paradice, and asking them who were thoſe two more glorious thē the reſt, they anſweared: they are the bleſſed Fathers S. Francis and S. Antony, and he who is almoſt the laſt, a
                        •
                     tyred in particuler glory, is a Religious who is now dead whome in this ſolemne tryumph we conduct to paradice, becauſe he hath couragiously battayled againſt temptations, and perſeuered in his holy purpoſe to the end. Theſe beautifull and ſumptious habits which we weare, are giuen vs for recompence of the ſo rude aſperity of the habitt which ſo patiently we woare in religion. God hath alſo endued vs with this glory for the humble penance which we haue ſupported, and for the holy obedience, chaſtity and pouerty which we haue with alacrity obſerued to the end. And therfore my child make no difficulty to weare the ſack cloth and habitt of our Religion, it being ſo profitable: in regard that if thou combatt couragiously in the habitt of

S. Francis miſpriſing the world, mortifying the fleſh, and reſiſting the deuill for the loue of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, I know thou ſhalt haue fruition of this glory. Which ſayd the viſion diſappeared, and the Nouice finding himſelfe full of comfort and conſolation in God, reiecting all the temptations, and reſoluing thenceforward to eſteeme al the rigours and contempts of Religion as ſportes and contentments, he therin liued and dyed very piously.

Which the ſwineheard hauing ſayd, the hogges without any noyſe incontinently haſtened into the ſtable, and were no more troubleſome to their guide. The Iudge perceauing this, touched with an extreme feare of the iuſtice of God, incontinently reiected his office, and became a Frere Minor, and one of his ſonnes, with him, and ſpent his life moſt exemplarly in that Order, in prayers &amp; teares, and ſo auſtere in penance, that being Miniſter Generall, he viſited all the Order barefoot: ſo did he gather ſo much profitt touching the good of his ſoule, euen of a vaine word.
               
               
                  
                  Of an admirable viſion that happened in the Couent of ſainct Francis of Lisbone.
                  THE XXXVI. CHAPTER.
                  Many holy parſons floriſhed in Spaine in the primatiue time of this Religion and eſpecially in the Prouince of S. Iames of Galicia, albeit of their worckes and ſanctity of life, particuler recordes are extāt of very few, amōg whome is of one Br. Iohn that reſided in the Couent of S. Francis att Lysbone within the prouince of Galicia, on whome our Lord beſtowed many ſpeciall graces, &amp; particulerly this, that in principall feaſtes, att the Euenſonges, Matines, or in Maſſe, he alwayes cōmunicated vnto him ſome ſpirituall conſolations. But one feaſt of S. Iohn Baptiſt, not hauing receaued the ordinary conſolations from Almighty God, att any of thoſe houres he was thereat exceedingly grieued, and therfore the Sixt houre being ſayd, and the Maſſe ended, he remayned alone in the quire bitterly lamēting, for feare that he had offēded our Lord IESVS CHRIST, in that he knew not the reaſon why he was depriued of thoſe ordinary graces, and in his hart, with ſighes ſobbes &amp; teares he cryed vnto God: My God, why haſt thou forſaken me? and thus perſeuering till all the Religious were in the refectory, he ſtill demaunded that ordinary ſpirituall almoſe of almighty God. And then did he heare a voice that ſayd: Iohn ariſe, goe to the refectory, follow the cō
                     munalty, and thinck not thy ſelfe better then the others. Wheratt being vtterly confounded, enclining his head, he went vnto the others into the refectory, and

And ſo after he had written in them all, he retourned to him that did read, and ſhutt vp his hart, the like he did to all the other Religious, ſaying: Confirmatum est nomen eius, which was an exceeding c

                  A notable miracle of the B. Sacrament, wrought in the Couent of S. Francis att Mans, a motiue and cauſe of the erection of a worthy confraternitie.
                  THE XXXVII. CHAPTER.
                  THe Couent of the citty of Mans, is one of the moſt ample and ancient of the Order, there commonly reſyding forty Religious or more, from the time that the bleſſed Electus, one of the companions of ſainct Francis there layd the foundation about the yeare 1215. A deuout and ample confratetnity (perhaps the moſt ancient of Chriſtendome) was erected, and is honorably continued in that Couent vpon this occaſion: A venerable and very ſimple Religious celebrating maſſe, a ſpider of lothſome greatnes caſually (or to ſpeake more Chriſtianly, by diuine prouidence) fell after conſecration into the ſacred chalice. The deuout Religious att firſt apprehēſion was much perplexed how to behaue himſelfe in the holy cōmunion (were it that the directiōs how to behaue himſelfe in the holy cōmunion (were it that the directiōs how to proceed in ſuch accidents were not then recorded in the Miſſall Rubriques as they are now, or that he did not then reflect on them, for more ample manifeſtation of the glory of God) he finally reſolued vpon that excellēt promiſe of our Lord: If they who beleeue in me as they ought, drink any mortiferous poyſon, they ſhall receaue no detriment thereby; &amp; ſo cōming to the ſacred communion of the precious bloud of our lord, he in one draught refected himſelfe both with poyſon and the medicament of death and of life, ſo that euen in this point might be accompliſhed that which the Church ſingeth att the reſurrection of our Lord: Mors &amp; vita duello conflixere mirando, and as here Dux vitae mortuus regnat viuus, ſo then did he graunt that effect to this ſame precious bloud that it expelled the poyſon, and without paine the venemous ſpider paſſed through the Prieſt a litle after, when the other Religious of the Couent and certaine deuout ſeculer perſons there preſent, thought no otherwiſe of the Celebratour (hauing by his relation vnderſtood what had happened) then thoſe of Malto conceated of the biting of S. Paul by the viper. Almighty God here renuyng that ancient miracle, ſauing that this appeareth greater, by the difference of an exteriour byting of a viper, and the interiour operation of a ſpider no leſſe venemous. The people of Mans that were euer very religious, did by this miracle ſo augment their deuotion vnto the B. Sacrament of the Altare, that att the ſame time was erected a Confraternity of innumerable perſons of all qualities, which is moſt deuoutly entertayned in that Couent, &amp; hath bin ſince imitated in diuers other Citties and townes of the kingdome

of France, to the glory of God, the augmentation of his ſeruice, and the benefitt of Chriſtian people
