            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

Of the whych yeres, there passed from the fyrst yere of Riuallus or Renaldus vntyll the laste yere of Porrex .ii. hūdreth .lxxviii. yeres. By whyche accompte it appereth, that the Brytōs, after the deth of the fore sayd bretherne, were in dyscord by the space of .li. yeres.

and other authours, was in the yere of the worlde .v. thousand C.li / &amp; the .xlviii. yere before Cristes comynge. And Eutropius sayeth in hys cronicle, that Caius Iulius did conquere Brytayn by .ii. yeres before he was create emperour / and he reygned as emperour .ii. yeres. And furthermore the sayde Eutropius affermeth, that Octauian Augustus successour of the sayde Iulius, began to reygne in the yere of the worlde .v. thousande .C.lviii. and that he reygned full .xli. yeres before Cryste was borne. whyche sayeng Iacobus Philippus and other auctours afferme. wherby it foloweth, that Iulius Cesar subdued Brytayne .xlviii. yeres before the comyng of Cryste, and the yere of the worlde, as before is sayde, v. thousande .C.li.

name. And about the .xxi. yere of this kynges reygne was the second persecucyon, vnder Domicianus. And also the thyrd persecucyon about the xxxv. yere of thys kynge vnder Tratanus. ca. lvii.

                        Coilus the sonn̄ of Marius, was made kyng of Brytayne, in the yere of our lorde .C. and .xxvi. and the yere from the fyrste Adam / and reygned yeres .liii. And about ye .xlv. yere of thys Coilus, was the fourthe persecucyon, vnder Marcus Antonius Amelius. ca. lviii.
                        fo. xxii.
                        Lucius the sonne of Coilus, begā hys reygne ouer the Brytons, in the yere of oure lorde an .C.lxxx. &amp; of the worlde. and reygned yeres .xii. Thys was the fyrste chrysten kyng in Brytayne. The image of Cryst at the north dore in the church of Poulys, was founde in the ryuer of Thames by thys Lucius. But an other authoure sayeth that it was founden in ye .xiiii. yere of Coilus or in the yere of the worlde .C.xl. ca. lix.
                        folio. xxii.
                        Of thys Lucius auctours do dout fully treate. For Galfride sayth that Lucius dyed in the yere of our lorde C.lvi. And Guido de Calūpna sayth that Lucius was cristened in the fore sayd yere. And Peter pictauiensis sayth that Lucius began to reygne in the yere of our lorde .C.lxxx. &amp; that he receyued the fayth in the .viii. yere of his reygn. And the Floure of historyes sayth that he reygned .xii. yeres after the fayth by hym receyued. Furthermore it is shewed in a certeyne table hangyng on the north parte of the quyre of Poules in Londont, hat the sayd Lucius was crowned kyng of Brytayne in the yere of grace .C.xxiii. and that he reygned .lxxvii. yeres. And the Englyshe cronycle agreeth therwith of hys coronacion / but it sayth that he reygned but only xii. yeres. And so there appereth a great dyscord betwene these wryters But all agreen that the sayd Lucius was conuerted to ye fayth in the tyme of pope Eleutherius / which after the concordance of many storyes was made pope about the yere of our lord C.lxxviii. wherfore Galfrides sayng is to be denayd, that sayth, he died in the yere of grace .C.lvi. and also the sayeng of Guydo for receyuyng of ye fayth. And rather we oughte to gyue credence to the foresayde table or to Peter pictauiensis that affermeth ye sayd Lucius to reygne .xii. yere. But some wryters that wrote the actes &amp; the reygnes of kynges, haue ouerskypt as it semeth the tyme whyche Lucius reygned before he receyued the fayth. And if he reygned before he receyued the fayth .xx. yeres and yt he receyued the faythe in hys .xx. yere, &amp; reygned after .xv. yeres / they haue accoūted the .xv. yere whyche he reygned as crysten kynge, and haue lette passe the other .xx. yere. And so is it to be thought that the forsayd auctour Peter pictauiens dyd. whych reason beynge alowed, the sayde table maye agre wyth the sayd Peter wythoute any greate dyfference whyche testyfyeth ye sayd Lucius to reygne .lxxvii yere as kynge. After whose deth in so moche that he dyed wythout any lawfull heyre / a great contēcion sprange amonge the Brytons that endured by .xv. yeres, as shall apere by the sequel. Trouth it is after all histories, that Seuerus a Romayne succeded Lucius in Brytayne. But because ye tyme is nat certaynly sette whan the sayd Seuerus subdued the Brytōs / therfore it is to noted, that whanne it was shewed to the Romaynes of the sedicion and discorde of the Brytōs,

&amp; of the sleyng of the Romayns than beyng in Brytayn / the senate sentte thyder the forsayd Seuerus wyth .ii legions of men. whych bare thē selfe so manfully, that in shorte whyle he compelled the Brytons to obey to the senate. whyche Policronicon affermeth to be about the yere of our lord C.xcv. In whyche yere as hath Iacobus Philippus, the sayde Seuerus began to raygne ouer the Romayns. But that dysagreeth from other Cronycles. For Eutropius, Matheolus &amp; the forsayde Iacobus Philippus sayth, that whan the sayde Seuerus had subdued the Arabyes, Parthys, and Gallys, after many battayls he came into Brytayn. where he beynge troubled wyth dyuers chaunces / at laste died in ye towne of yorke. where by it is to be supposed that in ye ende of hys reygn he came hether, &amp; about the .xii. yere of hys reygne ouer the Romayns which was the yere of our lorde .ii.C.vii. and that after he reygned ouer the Brytons .v. yere. wherefore it euydētly apereth, that the forsayd dyscord dured .xv. yeres / whych tyme Brytayne was wythoute a kynge.
                        
                     
                     Thus endeth the thyrde parte which conteyneth CC.lvi. yeres.

                        Here agayn authours forget ye yeres of the kynges folowyng. Of whyche I nat greatly maruyll. For in thys tyme muche discencyon was among the Romayne prynces / &amp; also amonge the Brytons cyuyll warre ceased nat. For they were so styrred wyth dyscencyon and warre, yt none coulde occupy the kyngedome any determynate tyme. For whyche cause and suche lyke, authours coude nat assyne any certeyne tyme to the prynces as me semeth. But that we maye come to some knowlege / Policronicon sheweth that constantius yt was father to Constantine the great, was sente by the senate into Brytayne, about the yere of our lord .ii.C.lxxix. and in the seconde yere of Probrus emperour / that he shuld subdue to ye Romayns Coelus than there kyng.

                  Also folowyng the sayd accompt, as wytnessyth the forsayde Euseby &amp; dyuerse other, the cyte of Rome was begon to be buylded in the xi. yere of Ezechias then kynge of Iuda / the whyche yere maketh after the sayde auctours, the yere of the worlde .iiii. thousande; foure hundred, lxx. And ye sayd auctours afferme, that the sayd cytye of Rome was edifyed after the subuersion of Troye, iiii. hūdred and xlvii. yeres. By whych reason it must folowe, that is was buylded in the yere of the world, as ys aboue sayde.

the subuersyon of Troye. whych xl. yeres ioyned to the former sayeng of Eusebius, maketh ye sayd nomber of .iiii. thousande and .lxiii. yeres.
                  Also a wryter of hystoryes called Iacobus Philippus, affermeth that Troye was taken by the Grekes, in the thyrde yere yt Abdon or Labdon, iudged the Israelytes. whych began his rule ouer the sayde Israelytes, after the accorde of moste wryters / in the yere of the worlde .iiii. thousande and .xx. wherunto yf there be ioyned thre yeres for ye third yere of his rule, in whyche yere Troye (as before ys sayde) was taken / and .xl. yeres that passed or Brute percyd Albyon: yt muste folowe, ye Brute entred fyrst. thys ile of Albyon (as before is sayd) in the yere of the world .iiii. thousand and .lxiii.
                  Then by these foresayd reasons Brute toke possession of this ile of Albyon / in the yere of the worlde, as before is sayde, before the buyldyng of the cytye of Rome, as by the foresayd reasons may be also prouyd .iiii. hundred and .vii. yeres: and before the incarnacyon of our blessyd sauyour folowynge the same accompte / a thousande an hundred .xxx. and vi. yeres.

                        Ben farre sette of, and putte from my mynde.

                        And hadde in them great vertue and prowesse.

                     THE FYRST CHAPITER.
                     
                        Syns that I haue shewed vnto you, what season and tyme of the yeres of ye world Brute entred fyrste this yle of Albyon: me semyth yt is cōuenyent, that I also shew how and for what cause yt was fyrste named Albyon. The whych so toke fyrst name, as wytnessyth Strabo and other writers, of the whyte clyues or rockes, yt stande vppon the sees syde, and are farre seen in clere wether and bryght dayes. wherof it was of olde wryters named Albyon, as yt were the whyte lande. whyche sayenge affermyth also Ranulphe &amp; dyuerse other: so that yt may certaynly be knowen, that yt toke not that fyrste name of Albyne doughter of Dioclecyan kyng of Sirye, as in the englyshe cronycle is affermyd. For in all olde storyes or cronycles is not founde, that any suche kynge of that name reygned ouer the Syriens, or yet Assyriens: nor yet any suche storye, that his .xxx. doughters shuld slee theyr .xxx. husbandes, as there is surmysed, was put in writynge. whyche, yf eny such wonder hadde ben there wrought, shulde not haue ben vnremembred of the wryters &amp; auctours of that partyes: consyderynge that many lesse wonders are put in writynge by the sayde wryters. wherfore it ys more apparant, yt yt toke that fyrst name of Albyon, as aboue is sayde / then of Albyne doughter of the sayde Dioclecyon.
                     And as to the Geaūtes that Brute founde in this yle at his arryuayll, they myght be brought into this lāde by some meane of shyppes or other wyse, rather then to be borne of those women, as there also is imagyned.
                     Of this yle the auctours Alpherd and Beda tell many wonders / which in the fyrst boke of Policronycon are suffyciētly towched, where it is sayd, yt this yle is called an other worlde. For as sayth Solinus, the edge of the Frenche cliffe shuld be the ende of the world, yf this yland ne were not. Many other thynges ben there specyfyed, the whyche I passe ouer.
                     Thys yle is closyd on all sydes with ye see / &amp; stretcheth in length out of the sowth into the north / hauynge in the sowthest syde Fraunce / in the south ye land of Spayne / in the north ye coūtre of Norway / &amp; in ye weste the coūtre of Irland. And hath in length from Totnesse to Catenessey .xv. myles beyonde Mychell Stowe in Cornewayle vpon .viii. hundred myles. And to reken the brede from saynte Dauyds lande in walys called Menema to Douer clyffes: it cōteyneth after moste wryters .iii. hundred myles. And yf yt be rekened from ye sayd place in walys, vnto parmouthe in Norfolk, not so much, but lesse by .lx. myles, after some wryters. And Beda saith it cōteineth ouer .CC. miles.

And this ile was fyrste as aboue ys sayde, named Albyon: and secundaryly Britayne after Brute: &amp; thyrde 
                           〈…〉
                         of Anglis by cōmaūdmēt of Egberte kynge of Anglys, and of westsaxons: all be yt that after some wryters yt was called Anglia, after the name of the quene of this lande name Anglia: albe it that therof is founde lytell authoryte.
                     This ile was fyrst cōqueryd by ye Romayns / and so contynued vnto them as trybutary, and vnder theyr rule, as after in the ende of the story of Gracianus shall appere, ouer .iiii. hūdred yeres: secondely by the Saxōs: thyrdely by ye Danys: &amp; fourthly by the Normans: and was deuyded fyrst by Brute in thre partes / as in the storie shall appere folowynge.
                  
                  
                     THE .II. CHAPITER.
                     BRute of the auncyent and noble blode of Troyans, dyscendyd of Eneas a Troyan and of the doughter of Pryame kynge of the Troyans: whyche Eneas receyued of his sayde wyfe a sonne named Ascanius, the whych was kynge of the countre of Italye nexte after hys father Eneas.
                     For so yt was, that after the foresayde cytye of Troy was, as before is sayde, by the Grekes subuertyd: Eneas, whyche entendyd to haue sauyd from dethe the fayre Polixena doughter of kynge Pryam / was for that dede by Agamemnon, duke or chyefe leder of the Grekes, exyled frō Troy: the whyche accōpanyed wyth a great nomber of Troyans, wythin iii. yeres after his departynge from Troye, landed in ye coūtre of Italye. And there after dyuerse conflyctys and bataylles hadde wyth Latynus then kynge of Italye: he maryed by the agrement of the sayde Latinus, hys doughter named Lauina. Uppon ye which he gatte a sonne, and named hym Syluius Posthumus: of the whych after some wryters descendyd Brutus fyrste kynge of Albyon. But for a more concordaunce of this worke and conuenyencye of yeres, As testyfyeth Policronia, Guydo de Colūna, wryter of storyes, &amp; other: Ascanius the fyrste sonne of Eneas, gotten vppon hys fyrste wyfe, hadde a sonne named Siluius / whyche after some wryters is named Siluius Eneas: this Siluius Eneas was father to Brute. Of this is dyuers opinyons, whereof some are manyfestly shewed in the .xxvii. chapyter of the seconde boke of Polycronycon.
                     Then yt foloweth in ye story: this Brute beyng of the age of .xv. yeres, slewe his father in shotyng at a wyld beste. And as some authours haue / he slewe also hys moder in tyme of his byrth. But for the laste dede, by agrement of all wryters, he was banyshed the countre: and after by fortune landed wyth his conpanye in a prouynce of Grece / where at ye tyme reygned a kyng named Pandrasus, or after some wryters Pandarus: ye whyche kynge, as affermyth Geffrey of Monmouth, was lynyally descendyd of the blode of Achylles.
                     In this prouynce Brute founde many Troyans, as captiuys &amp; thrall to the Grekes, wyth the whyche he conspyred &amp; faughte wyth ye Grekes sondry tymes: &amp; lastely for a fynall concorde toke to wyfe the doughter of the sayd Pandrasus, name Ignogen. After whyche maryage solemnysyd: the sayde Brute, by coūsayle of ye Troyans, with a certayne of shyppes well vytaylled / departed out of Grece, and soughte his aduenture. whyche after many daungers of the

passed / he landed wyth his company in a parte or yle of Affrica named (as sayth Guydo and other) Lergesia. wythin whyche yle at those dayes stode an old temple dedycate in ye honoure of Diua or Diana a goddesse of mysbyleued people. The whyche temple, when Brute had apꝑceyuyd anon he yode into yt / where knelyng before the aulter, wyth great deuocyon, sayde these versys folowynge.

                        WHen Brute awoke and remēbred hym of this vysyon: anō he called to hym such as he most trusted / and shewed to them what he had seen &amp; harde. wherof they all beynge greatly reioysed: caused great fares to be made, in the whyche they cast wyne, mylke, and other lycours, wyth dyuerse aromate and spyces of moste swettest odour, as in the olde pagan lawes and rytes were vsed.

                        REtourne we then to Brute / whyche after his landyng in this ile of Albyon: circuyd &amp; serchyd ye land ouer all / and foūde yt full fertyle &amp; plenteous of wode and of grasse, and garnysshed with many fayre ryuers and stremes. And in his trauaylynge the lande / he was encountred wyth many great and myghty gyauntes / the whych he destroyed. Among ye which as reherseth that Englyshe cronicle: was one of passyng strength named Gogmagog / the whyche he caused to wrestle wyth Cormeus or Coryne his neuewe besyde Douer: in which wrestlinge that gyaūt brake a rybbe in the syde of Cormeus. where thorough Corineꝰ beyng sore amoued, wyth great strength supprysed that gyaunt, &amp; cast hym downe the rocke of Douer. By reason wherof as affermyth ye said englyshe cronicle, ye place was named the fall of Gogmagog.
                     But after that ye name was chaū
                        ged &amp; called the fall of Douer / which to this daye enduryth. For this dede and other Brute gaue vnto his sayd neuewe Corineus or Coryn the hole countre of Cornewayll.
                     And whē Brute had thus destroyed the gyauntes, &amp; serchyd the sayde yle of Albyō thoroughly: he cōmyng by ye ryuer of Thamis, for pleasure ye he had in that ryuer, with also the cō
                        modytyes therunto adioynynge / began there to buylde a cytye in ye remē
                        braunce of the cytye of Troye lately subuerted, &amp; named it Troynouant / whyche is as myche to saye as newe Troy: whych name endured tyll the cōmynge of Lud after kynge of Brytayne vpon the tyme of a thousande lxviii. yere. But ye sayd kyng cōmaundyd yt to be called Luddys towne / which by shortnesse of speche is now called London.
                     Then whē Brute had thus buylded his cytye, &amp; saw yt he was stablysshed in his realme quyetly: he thē by thaduise of his lordes / cōmaunded ye sayd ile &amp; coūtre to be called Britayn and his people Brytons / and so contynued his reygne prosperousely.

In the whyche tyme he stablysshed and ordred his people to lyue in tyllynge of theyr lande and otherwyse.
                     This Brute had receyued of his wyfe thre sonnes, wherof the fyrste was named Locrinus or Locryne / ye seconde Cambrius or Cambre / and ye third Albanactus or Albanakt. To the fyrst and eldest, he besette this yle of Brytayne, the whyche after was named myddell Englande / whych is to meane Troynouant, wyth all ye coū
                        tres there about lyenge, cōteynynge est, west, &amp; sowth. And for this cause, and for yt shuld sounde towarde the name of the sayd Locryne: this parte of Brytayne was longe after called Loegria or Logiers.
                     To the seconde sonne Cambre, he beset or appoynted to hym the coū
                        tre of walys / the whyche was fyrste named after hym Cambria. This in the eest syde was somtyme departed from Englande by the ryuer of Seuerne: But now in the north syde the ryuer named Dee at Chester departeth England and walys: and in the sowth the ryuer that is called Uaga at the castell of Strynglyng parteth Englande and walys.
                     To the thyrde sonne Albanakt, he besette the north parte of this yle, and named yt Albyon / or more veryly the sayd countre toke after ye name of the sayd thirde sonne, and was called Albania. This coūtre was after named Scotlande / and is deuyded from Loegria or Logiers, as saythe holy Beda by two armys of ye see, but they mete not. The eest arme of these two begynneth about ii. myles from the mynster of Eburcurynge, in the west syde of Penulton̄. The weste arme of those twayne hath in ye ryght syde or somtyme hadde, a stronge cytye named Acliud, whych in ye Brettysshe tunge was called Clynt
                           •
                        ton, &amp; stādeth vppon the ryuer called Clynt
                     Thus whē Brute had diuided this yle of Brytayne, as before is shewed in thre partes, and hadde holden the pryncypate therof nobly by the terme of .xxiiii. yeres after most cōcordaūce of writers: he dyed, and was enteryd or buryed at Troynouāt or London.
                  
                  
                     THE .V. CHAPITER.
                     
                        LOcrinus or Locryne ye fyrst or eldest son of Brute was made kynge of Brytayne of ye countre of Logiers / the yere of the worlde .iiii. thousande .lxxx. and .vii. The whych helde to his parte, as sayth Policronicon, and also Guydo de Columna, the countre that stretcheth from the south see vnto the ryuer of Humbre, as before is expressyd.
                     whyle this Locrinus thus reygned in Logiers: his brother Albanactus beynge ruler, as before is sayd of Albania or Scotlande, was warreyd by a duke, whome the cronycle of Engāld nameth Humbre / ye which slewe Albanakt in playne batayll.
                     ye shall vnderstande yt this Humber at the daye of his commynge into Albania was not named Humber / but after olde wryters he was called kynge of Hunnys or kyng of Sithia without other addicyon. This kyng as before is sayde, after he thus subduyd Albanactus / held the lande of Albania, tyll after ye Locrinus wyth his brother Cambre, gathered a gret power of men of armys, and yode agaynst the sayde kynge of Hunnys / and by strength of theyr Britons chasyd and subduyd the sayde Hūnys so sharpely, that many of thē with theyr kyng were drowned in a ryuer, which departyth England and Scotland. And for so myche as to the wryter of

the storye of Brytons, his name was declared to be Humber: therfore the sayde auctor affermyth, that the sayd Humber ye ryuer toke the fyrste name of hym / whyche yet contynueth to this daye.
                     Furthermore testyfyeth the sayde auctour, that after this victory thus obteyned by these two forsayde brotherne: this Locrinus enamowred hym selfe vppon a fayre wenche named Estrylde, and doughter of the forenamed Humber / and her kept vnlefully by a certayne of tyme. where wyth his wyfe named Guendoloena beynge sore dyscontent / excyted her fader and frēdes to make warre vppon the sayde Locryne her husbande. In the whyche warre lastly he was slayne / when he hadde reygned or ruled Loegria or Logiers after the concordaunce of moste writers .xx. yeres: and was buryed by his fader in the cytye of Troynouaunt / leuyng after hym a yonge sonne gottē vppon his wyfe named Madan.

And so hauyng possession of the sayde yle, wele and dyscretly she ruled yt, to the comfort of her subiectes / tyll the tyme her sonne Madan came vnto hys lawfull age. At the whiche season she gaue ouer the rule and domynyon to hym / after she had ruled (as before ys sayde) thys yle xv. yeres.

                        dolyne before named: was made ruler of Britayne, in the yere of ye world iiii. thousande .C. and .xxii. Of thys is lytell or no memory made by any wryters / excepte that some wryte of hym, that he vsed great tyranny amonge his Brytons. Neuerthelesse all or the more ꝑte of writers agreen / that he ruled this ile of Britayn by ye terme of .xl. yeres. At ye ende of which terme, he beynge at his dysporte or huntyng, was of wyld bestes or woluys slayne or deuouryd: and left after him two sonnes, as sayth Policronica, named Menprecius &amp; Manliꝰ.

                        MEnprecius the eldest sonne of Madan was made ruler of Brytayne / in the yere of the worlde .iiii thousande .C.lxii. But he reygned not lōge in peace. For his yonger broder Manlius, of a malycyous and couetyse mynde entendynge to be kynge, and to expell or subdue his brother: excyted the Britons, in such wyse to rebell agayne Menprecius, ye great and dedly warre contynued longe amonge them. Howe be yt lastely by mediacyons of frendes, a daye of communycacyon in louynge maner ner attwene these two bretherne was appoynted. At whyche daye of assemble Menpriciꝰ by treason slewe his brother Manlius / after whose deth he lyued in more tranquylite and rest. where through he fyll into slowth, and by meane of slowth into vnlefull lykynge and lechery / and by

that vyce into hatered of his subiectes by takynge of theyre wyues and chylder: and fynally became so vnhappy, yt he forsoke his lefull wyfe and concudynes, and fyll into the synne of Sodomye. Thus from one vice he grew into a nother / so that he became odyble to god and man: and lastely goyng on huntynge, and lost of his people / was distroyed of wyld bestes, when he had reygned .xx. yeres: leuyng after hym a goodly yonlynge begoten of his lefull wyfe named Ebranke.
                  
                  
                     THE .IX. CHAPITER.
                     EBranke the sonne of Menprecius was made ruler of this lande of Brytayne / in the yere of the worlde foure thousande a hundred, lxxx. and .ii: and had, as testyfyeth Policronica, Gaufryde, &amp; other wryters .xxi. wyues: of the whych he receyued .xx. sonnes and .xxx. doughters / wherof the fayrest was named Gwales, or after some Gualea. He sent these doughters to Albia Siluius, whych was the .xi. kynge of Italye, or the .vii kynge of Latynes / to the ende to haue them maryed to the blood of Troyans. This Ebranke was also a man of fayre statute, &amp; of great strengthe, &amp; by his power and myght he enlarged his domynyon / in so myche that he wanne and occupyed a great parte of Germania by ye ayde and helpe of the Latynes / and retourned thēs wyth great pray &amp; ryches. After whych retourne, he buylded the cytye of Caerbrank now called yorke: whych shulde be, as sayth the authour named Flos historiarū, or the Floure of historyes wryten in frenche / in the .xxiii. yere of ye reygne of the sayd Ebranke. which accompt to folow, yt shuld seme that Troynouant or Lōdon was buylded before the sayd cytye of yorke, about an hundred and .xl. yeres: supposyng the cytye of London to be begonne in the seconde yere of Brutes reygne.

After which edyfyces ended and made: he wyth a great armye sayled into Gallia nowe Fraunce, and subdued the Gallis, and retourned wyth great triumphe and rychesse. And when he had guyded this lande of Brytayne nobly by the terme of .lx. yeres, after moste concordaunce of wryters, he dyed, and was buryed at Caerbrank or yorke / leuynge after hym for hys heyre his eldest sonne (as sayth Gaufryde) named Brute Greneshyelde.

Of this Brute is no memory made touchynge any fame / excepte ye Gaufryde sayth that he ruled this lande of Brytayne (his fader lyuynge) a certayne tyme / &amp; after his fader by the terme of .xii. yeres.

                     But of this Leyr speketh some dele the aboue named authour Floure of

historyes sayeng, yt in the ende of his reygne he fyll to slowth and vnlefull lykyng of his body: by meane wherof cyuyle stryfe began to grow with in this realme / ye which was not pacifyed by some termes after his dayes: the whyche sayenge is not denyed by the foresayd authour Gaufrid. This Leyll lefte after hym a sonne named Lud, or after some wryters he was named Lud Hurdibras.

In the tyme of buyldyng, of which town of Septon, as affermyth myne authour Gaufride, an egle there spake certayn wordes, ye which he sayth he wyll not declare or wryte for any certaynte. Thus when this sayde Lud hadde ruled this lande nobly by the terme of .xxxix. yeres, he dyed, &amp; lefte after hym a sonne named Baldud.
                  
                  
                     THE .XIII. CHAPITER.
                     BAldud ye sonne of Lud Hurdibras, was made gouernoure of Brytayne in the yere of the world iiii. thousand .iii. hundred and .xviii. This as testyfyed Gaufryde, Polycronica, and other, was well and suffycyently instructe in the connynges or scyēces of astronomy &amp; nigromancye. By thē he made the hote bathes wythin the town of Caerbadon, now named Bathe: the whyche towne or cytye he also buyldyd. But to that repugnyth wyllyam de Malmesbury, saynge that the foresayd hote bathes were made by the industrye, or of the industry of Iulius cesar fyrste emperour of Rome. This Baldud as affermyth the foresayd authour Gaufride: taught this lore of nigromācy thorough his realme: &amp; fynally toke in yt such pryde &amp; presumpsyon / yt he toke vpō him to fle in ye ayer. But he fyll vpon the temple of his god Apolyn, &amp; theron was all to torne / when he had ruled Brytayne by the space of .xx. yeres, leuynge after hym a son named Leyr.
                  
                  
                     THE .XIIII. CHAPITER.
                     LEyr ye sonne of Baldud was made ruler ouer ye Britōs, the yere of ye world .iiii.M.ccc. &amp; xxxviii. This Leyr was noble of cōdicyōs, &amp; guyded his land &amp; subiectes in great welth. He made ye towne of Caerleyr nowe called Leyceter or Leycester. And all be yt yt this man helde longe the pryncypate of Brytayne: yet of hym is nothynge left worthy memory, excepte that Gaufryde sayth, yt he receyued of his wyfe .iii. doughters onely wythout any son / whych were named Gonorilla, Ragan, and Cordeilla, the whych he mych loued / but moste specially he loued the yongest, Cordeilla by name.
                     whē this Leyr or Leyth after some wryters, was fallen in competente age, to knowe the mynde of his thre doughters, he fyrst asked Gonorilla the eldeste howe well she loued hym: the whych callyng her goddes to recorde, sayd she loued hym more then her owne soule. wyth this answere the father beynge well contented, demaunded of Ragan the seconde doughter, howe well she loued hym.

To whom she answered, and affermynge wyth great othes, sayde that she coude not wyth her tong expresse the great loue that she bare to hym: affermynge furthermore, that she loued hym aboue all creatures. After these pleasaūt answeres had of those two doughters, he called before hym Cordeilla ye yongest. The whych vnderstādyng ye dyssymulacyō of her .ii. susters, entēdyng to proue her fader, sayd: most reuerent fader where my ii. systers haue dyssymuled wyth the with their pleasaūt word fruteles, I knowyng ye great loue &amp; faderly zele, that toward me euer before this time thou hast borne (for ye whych I may not speke to the otherwyse thē my cō
                        scyence ledyth me) therfore I saye to the father I haue loued the euer as my fader, &amp; shall cōtynually whyle I lyue, loue the as my naturall father. And yf thou wylt further be inquisytyfe of the loue that I to the bere: I ascertayne the, that asmyche as thou arte worthy to be beloued / euen so myche I loue the and no more.
                     The fader wyth this answere beynge discōtent: maryed his .ii. elder doughters, that one vnto the duke of Cornewayll, &amp; that other vnto the duke of Albania or Scotlande &amp; deuyded wyth thē two in maryage his lande of Britayne after his deth, and the one halfe in hand duryng his naturall lyfe. And for the thyrde Cordeilla reserued nothynge.
                     It so fortuned after / that Aganippus, whych the cronycle of England named Agamp and kyng of Fraūce / harde of ye beaute and womāhode of Cordeilla, and sent vnto her fader, &amp; axyd her in maryage. To whome yt was answered, that the kynge wold gladly gyue to hym his doughter, but for dowar he wolde not departe with: for he had all promysed vnto hys other two doughters.
                     Aganippus thus by his messagyers enfourmed: remembred the vertues of the forenamed Cordeilla / &amp; wythoute promesse of dowar maried the sayde Cordeilla.
                     But here is to be noted / yt where this Aganippus or Agamp is called in dyuerse cronicles kyng of Fraūce: yt can not agre with other hystories, nor wyth the cronycle of Fraunce. For yt is testyfyed by Polycronica, by Peter Pictauyēce, by mayster Robert Gagwyne, by byshop Antonyne and many other cronicles: that lōge after thys daye was no kynge in Fraunce / nor longe after yt was called Frauce: but at this daye the inhabytauntes therof were called Galli, and were trybutaryes vnto Rome wythoute kynge, tyll the tyme of Ualentinianus emperour of Rome / as hereafter in this worke shall be manyfestly shewed.
                     The storye of Britons sayth, that in the tyme that Leyr reygned in Britayne: the land of Fraunce was vnder the domynyon of .xii. kynges, of the whych Aganippus shuld be one. The whyche sayenge is full vnlyke to be trew, whych myght be prouyd by many reasons, which I passe ouer for length of tyme.
                  
                  
                     THE .XV. CHAPITER.
                     tHen yt foloweth in the story, after this Leyr was fallen in age, these forsayde two dukes thynkyng longe or the lordshyp of Brytayne was fallen to theyr handes: arrose agayne theyr father (as testifyeth Gaufryde) and beraft hym the gouernaunce of the land vppon certayne cōdycyons to be contynued for terme of lyfe: the whyche in processe of tyme more and more were minyshyd, as well by Maglaunus as by Hēninus husbādes of the forenamed Gonorild &amp; Ragan. But moste

dyspleased Leyr the vnkyndnesse of his two doughters, consyderynge theyr wordes to hym before spoken and sworne / and now founde &amp; prouyd them all contrarye.
                     For the whyche he beyng of necessyte constrayned: fledde his lande, &amp; sayled into Gallia, for to be comforted of his doughter Cordeilla, wherof she hauyng knowlege, of naturall kyndnesse cōforted hī: &amp; after shewynge all the maner to her husbande, by his agrement receyuyd hym &amp; his to her lordes courte / where he was cherished after her beste maner.
                     Longe yt were to shew vnto you ye circumstaunce of ye vtterans of the vnkyndnesse of his two doughters, and of the wordes of comfort gyuen to hym by Aganippus and Cordeilla, or of the coūsaile and purueyaūce made by the sayde Aganippus &amp; his lordes for restorynge of Leyr agayn to his dominyō. But fynally he was by the helpe of the sayde Aganippus restored agayne to his lordshyp / and so possessed, lyued as ruler &amp; gouernour therof by the space of .iii. yeres after. In whych season dyed Aganippus. And when this Leyr had ruled this lande by the terme of .xl. yeres, as affermeth dyuerse cronycles, he dyed and was buryed at his towne of Caerleir or Leycestre: leuynge after hym for to inheryte the lande his doughter Cordeilla.

And thus was Margan slayne, whan he hadde regned wyth his brother two yeres.

This Riuallus ruled ye Brytōs with great sobernesse, &amp; kepte the lande in great welthe and prosperyte / all be yt that of hym is lefte no specyall memorye of acte done in his tyme / except myn authour sayth, that in ye tyme of his, reygne yt reyned blood by the space of .iii. days contynually wythin the lande of Brytayne. After the whych reyne ensued so great excedynge nō

                     GUrgustius the sonne of ye fore named Riuallus, was made ruler of Brytayne / in the yere of the worlde .iiii. thousane .iiii. hundred lxxxiii. This in ye cronicle of Englād is named Gorbodiam sonne of Reygnold, Of the which is lytell memory made, other of his regne or of his dedes by any authours or wryters of ye hystorye of Brytayne / excepte the aboue named olde authoure, and the authoure called the floure of hystoryes, wytnessyth, that he reygned xxxviii. yeres: leuynge after hym none heyre of his bodye begotten / and lastely dyed and was buryed by his fader at Caerbrank or yorke.

                     This in ye englyshe boke is named Seyzill. Of the whych is no mencyon made nother of his reygne nor dedes, excepte that Geffrey of Monmouth wryter of ye hystoryes of Brytons, sayth that he reygned two yeres. whyche sayenge is not accordaunte wyth other wryters. But more to the cōuenyency of tyme and agrement of other cronyclers, accordyng to the sayeng of the forenamed old authour: he reygned by ye terme of .xlix. yeres / and after dyed &amp; was buryed at Caerbadon or Bathe / and lefte after hym none heyre of his bodye begotten.

This also ys vnmynded of wryters, other for restfulnesse of tyme, or ellys for rudenesse of his dedes, that clerkes lyste not to spēde any tyme in wrytynge of such dedes.

                     BInimacus the sonne of Sisilliꝰ as some wryters haue, but more verytably as sayth the olde cronycle, ye brother of Lago, was made ruler of Brytayne / in the yere of the world .iiii. thousand .iiii. hūdred .lxxx and xv: the whyche (as his brother before hym) passed his tyme without any notable actes or dedes: so that of hym is no more memorye made, thē of his brother. For the more party they that wrote the faytes &amp; dedes of Brytons, make but a shorte rehersayll of these .v. kynges / yt is to saye, from Ryuallo to Gorbodug / sayeng that after Ryuallo succedyd Gurgustius / after hym succedyd Lago, to Lago succedyd Kinimacus / &amp; after Kinimacus succeded Gorbodug. Of these .v. kynges or rulers is made lytell other mencyon. Thenne yt foloweth in the sayd olde cronicle / that when this Kinimacus had reygned liiii. yeres: he dyed and was buryed by his brother at Caerbrāk or york: leuynge after hym a sonne, as testyfyeth Flos historiarū / whych sonne was named Gorbodug.

This by most lykelyhode to brynge historyes to accorde: shulde reygne ouer the Brytons the terme of .lxiii. yeres. whych terme endyd, he dyed and lyeth buryed at new Troy or Lōdon / leuyng

after hym two sonnes named Ferrex and Porrex / or after some wryters Ferreus and Porreus.
                  
                  
                     THE .XXV. CHAPITER.
                     FErrex wyth Porrex hys brother, sonnes of Gorbodug: were ioyntly made gouernours and dukes of Britayne / in the yere of the worlde foure thousande .vii. hundred and .xi / and contynued in amytye a certayne tyme. After whyche tyme expyred, as witnessyth Policronica and also Gaufride, Porrex beynge couetouse of lordeshyp: gaderyd his peple, vnwetynge Ferrex his brother / entendynge to destroy hym. wherof he beynge warned, for lacke of space to assemble his people / for sauegard of his persone, fled sodeynly into Gallia or Fraūce, and axyd ayd of a duke of Gallia named by Gaufryde Gunhardus or Suardus: the the whych duke hym ayded and sent hym agayne into Brytayne with his hoste of Gallis. After whose lādynge his brother Porrex with his Brytōs hym mete, and gaue to hym batayll: in the whyche batayll Ferrex was slayne with ye more part of his peple.
                     But here dyscordeth myn authour wyth some other wryters, and wyth the cronycle of Englande: for they testyfye, that Porrex was slayne, and Ferrex suruyuyd. But whether of them was lyuyng, the moder of these two brethern named widen settynge a parte all moderly pytye: with help of her women entred the chambre (of hym so lyuynge) by nyght / and hym there slepynge slew cruelly, and cut into small peces. And thus dyed the two foresayde bretherne / after they had thus ruled Brytayne in warre and peace to the agrement of moste wryters .v. yeres.

                     HEre now endeth the lyne or of sprynge of Brute / after the affermaunce of moste wryters. For Gaufride saith after the deth of these forenamed bretherne / great discorde arose amonge the Brytons / y• which longe tyme among them continued: by meane wherof the people and coū
                        tre was sore vexed and noyed vnder v. kynges. And further saith Guydo de Columna, that the Brytons abhorred the lynage of Gorbodug / for so myche as fyrste that one brother slew that other / and more for the innaturall dysposycyon of the morder, that so cruelly slew her owne chylde.
                     The cronycle of Englande sayth, that after the deth of the two forenamed bretherne / no ryghtfull enherytour was lefte on lyue. wherfore the the people were brought in great discorde / in so myche that the land was deuydyd in foure partyes. So that in Albania was one ruler / in Loegria or Logiers one other ruler / in Cambria the thyrde duke or ruler / &amp; in Cornewayle the .iiii. duke or ruler. But of these .iiii. dukes the english cronicle alloweth Cloton̄ duke of Cornewayll for moste ryghtefull heyre.
                     Policronyca sayth that after ye deth of the foresayde two bretherne, great dyscorde was in the lande / whyche greuyd the people sore vnder .v. kynges. But he nother reheseth the names nor the tymes of theyr regnes / excepte he addeth to, that the sayde dyscorde contynued tyll the tyme of Moliuncius Dumuallo. So yt here appereth no tyme certayn, how lōge this varyaunce and dyscorde amōg the Brytons contynued. But who so lyst to loke vpon a draught made by me in english in ye beginnyng of this boke: he shall se there (yf he please to

caste ouer the tymes and yeres there expressed) that this forsayde discorde contynued nere to the terme of .li. yeres. In whyche draught or conceyte yf any man here fynde erroure: of his goodnes lette hym amende &amp; correcte yt / and all other places where he shall by good profe fynde place of correccyon.

                        MUlmutius Dunuallo or as some haue Dunuallo Mulmutius, the sonne of Cloten̄ as testyfyeth the englyshe boke, &amp; also Gaufride: was venquesshour of ye other dukes or rulers / and began his reygn ouer the hole monarchy of Brytayne, in the yere of the worlde .iiii. thousand vii. hundred &amp; .xlviii. This is named in the englyshe cronycle Donebant: the whyche was a noble man, &amp; causyd to be made wythin the cytye of Troynouant a temple, and named it the temple of peace. The whyche after some opynyons is that place or feld / where ye market of wollen cloth is holden called or named Blakwelhall. He also made many good laws the which were long after vsed &amp; called Mulmutiꝰ lawes. These lawes holy Gyldas wrote wyth great dylygence out of the brettishe speche into latyne. And longe tyme here after ye, Aluredus kynge of England turned those lawes oute of latyne into englyshe. He also gaue pryuylege to temples, to plowghes &amp; cytyes, and to the wayes ledynge to ye same. And as some authours wytnesse / he beganne the foure hye wayes of Brytayne / the whych were fynyshed and perfyted of Belinus his sonne, as after at length shall be declared. The olde cronycle testyfyeth yt this Mulmutius, whyche he in his boke nameth Molle, made the two townes of Malmesbury and Uyes. And all other writers afferme, that this Mulmutius, after he hadde stablyshyd his lande, and sette his Brytons in

good and conuenyent order: by the aduyce of his lordes / he ordeyned hym a crowne or dyademe of gold / &amp; caused hym selfe to be crowned wyth great solempnyte after the vsaunce of pagane lawe then vsed. And for this cause, after the opynyon of some wryters / he is named the fyrste kyng of Britayn. And all ye other before rehersyd are named rulers, dukes, or gouernours.
                     Then yt foloweth in the storye / when Mulmutiꝰ had guyded ye land well and honorably by the terme of xl. yeres: he dyed and was buryed in the foresayde temple of peace within Troynouant or Lōdon / leuynge after hym two sonnes named Belinus and Brennus.
                  
                  
                     THE .XXIX. CHAPITER.
                     BElinus and Brennꝰ the two sonnes of Mulmutius: beganne to raygne ioyntly as kynges of Brytayne / in the yere of the world iiii. thousande .viii.C. &amp; viii: so that Belinus held to hym Loegria or Logiers, walys, and Cornewayll / and Brennus held to his parte all ye land ouer &amp; beyonde Humber. with which partycyon eyther of them was cōtentyd &amp; pleasyd, as testyfyeth Polycronica, by the terme of .v. yeres. After the whyche terme endyd and expired Brennus entendynge to haue more lande or all: arose agaynste his brother Belyne, and made vppon hym mortall warre. In the whych warre Brennus was ouersette, and was cō
                        pelled to flye the land and sayle vnto Armorica now named lytell Britayn or as sayth Gaufryde, into a countre called Allebrog, as after shalbe more playnely declared / and there allyed hym after the foresayde terme (as before is sayd) of .v. yeres was expyryd as affermeth Policronica. For Gaufryde sayeth in his boke made of the hystory of Brytons / yt after ye terme of .v. yeres afore sayde were expyred and runne, Brennus by sterynge of yonge and euyll counsayll, entēdyng as before is sayde: sayled vnwetyng his brother into Norway, and there maryed the doughter of Elfunge or Elfynge then ruler or duke of Norwaye, when this was shewed vnto Belyn, consyderynge the sodayne departyng: in all haste he seasyd Albania and all the other lande apperteynyng to Brenne into his owne hand, and strengthed the cytyes and other stronge places wyth his owne sowdyours. wherof when Brenne was warned: he in all possyble haste assembled a great people of the Norwayes, and toke hys shyppynge to sayle into Brytayne. And as he was kepynge his course vpon the see: he was encountred wyth Guilthdacus kynge of Denmarke, the whych had lyen in awayte for hym, for loue of ye wenche yt Brennus had maryed: for before tyme he had requyred her of Elfungeher fader. whē those .ii. flotꝭ were mette: strong shotte and fyght was vppon both partyes. But fynally the Danes ouercame the Norwayes or Norganys, and toke the shyppe by strength whych the wēche was in / yt whych anone was brought vnto the shyppe of Guilthdake: and Brenne wyth a fewe of his shyppes lefte was fayne to sauegarde hym selfe by flyght.
                     when Guilthdake hadde thus obteyned ye vyctorye, entendynge to haue sayled towarde Denmarke: in shorte whyle after ye tempestes came so hydous vppon the see, that hys nauye was deuyded and scatered that one frome the other / in suche wyse that he was in fere to haue ben drowned. And at the ende of fyue dayes not wetynge where he was / 

wyth fewe shyppes landed in the coū
                        tre of Northumberlande, where at that tyme was Belyn prouydyng defence agayne his brothers cōmyng. wherof when word was brought vnto Belyn of the landynge of the fore sayde Danoys prynce wyth a small company: he reioysed yt, and cōmaū
                        ded hym wyth his shyppes &amp; company to be put in sure holde &amp; kepynge.
                     It was not long after but Brēne hadde reculyd and gaderyd to gyder the more parte of hys nauye before (as ye haue harde) chased. And when he hadde theym newely ryggyd and vytayled / he herynge of the aryuayll of Guilthdacus in Norththūberlād with his wife, sent wordꝭ of manace vnto his brother Belyn / wyllyng hym to sende vnto hym his wyfe wrōgfully rauyshed by Guilthdacus / &amp; also to restore vnto him his land &amp; patrymony / or ellys he wold shorthely inuade his lande, yt for to waste, &amp; his enymy to destroye. The whych desyre or request of Belynus was playnely and shortely denyed. whych knowlege had: Brennꝰ shortly after landed in a parte of Albania, and made towarde his brother / and his brother towarde hym: so yt theyr hostes met nere vnto a wood named at that day Calater or Calaterium, where betwene them was a mortall batayll / in so myche that mych people fyll vpon both partyes. But lastly the Brytons wanne the felde, and chasyd the Norganys or Norways vnto theyr shyppes / chasynge &amp; sleyenge them without pyty. And as affermeth myne authour, ye fyght was so cruell and sharpe: that there was slayne to the nomber of .xl.M. men.
                     After this dyscumfyture Brenne was constrayned to flee / and wyth fewe in nomber recoueryd the lande of Gallia.
                     Belinus hauyng thus victorye of his enemyes / after thankes and oblacyons made vnto his goddes, after the pagane law: he then assembled his lordes at Caerbrank or yorke, to haue theyr aduyse what he shuld do wyth the prynce of Denmark. In ye whych counsayle yt was concludyd / that the foresayd Guylthdacꝰ shulde holde and do homage to the kynge of Britayn for the land of Dēmark, and yerely bere to hym a certayne tribute. whyche done wyth suerty and hostages taken: the sayde Guylthdacus wyth his loue was sette at lybertye and leue, to retourne into his owne countre: whych yerely tribute as testyfyeth the englyshe cronycle, was a thousande pounde.
                  
                  
                     THE .XXX. CHAPITER.
                     Then yt foloweth in ye hystory, when Belyn hadde thus vyctory of this enemyes, and was alone possessoure of this realme of Brytayne: the lawes before made by his father he cōfermed, and ordeyned iustyce to be mynystred thorough the lande. And for so myche as the .iiii. wayes begon by his fader, were not perfyghtyd and endyd: he therfore causyd workmen to be called, and set theym to paue wyth stone the sayde wayes, that they myght suffycyently be knowen of all waygoers or traueyllers of the countres as hereafter ensuyth.
                     The fyrst of these .iiii. wayes was named Fosse, the whyche stretchyd oute of the southe into the north / and begynneth, or at that dayes beganne, at the corner of Totnesse in Cornewayle, and passed forth by Deuynshyre, Somersetshyre, &amp; so forth by Tutbury vpon Cotteswolde, besyde Couētre vnto Leycestre, &amp; from thennes by wylde playnes towarde Newerke, and endyth at the cytye of Lyncoln̄.
                     
                        The second waye was named watlyngstrete / the which stretcheth ouer thwarte ye wayes of Fosse out of the southest into the northest. This beganne at Douer, and passeth by the myddell of Kente ouer Thamys besyde London by weste of westmynster / and so forth by saynte Albanys in the weste syde of Dunstable, of Stratford, of Towceter, and of we don / by south Kyllyngburne of Kyllebourn̄, by Athicston̄, vnto Gylbertes hyll, that now is named wrekyn / and so forth by Seuarn̄ passynge besyde wrokceter, &amp; forth vnto Stratton̄ to the myddell of walys vnto a place called Cardycan / at ye Irysh se.
                     The thyrde waye was named Ermyngstrete. The whyche stretcheth out of the weste northweste vnto the eest southeest, &amp; bygynneth at Menema, the whych is in saynt Dauies lande in weste walys / and so stretcheth forth vnto south Hampton̄.
                     The fourth and last waye is called or was called Kykenyldis strete. The which stretcheth forth by worceter, by wycombe, by Birmyngham, by Lychefyld, by Derby, by Chesterfyeld, by yorke. And so forth vnto Tymmouth: ye whych was suffycyētly made. He graūted &amp; confermed thē all suche priuyleges as before were graūted by Dūuallo his fader. The whych priuyleges with other lawes by hym made, who yt is desyrous to know: let hym rede ouer ye trāslacyon ye holy Gildas made of Mulmutius lawes out of Brytyshe speche in to latyne / and there he shall se the circumstaunce of euery thynge.
                     In this whyle that Belyn was thus occupyed aboute the nedes of his land / his brother Brenne beyng, as before is sayde, in a prouynce of Gallia takynge sore to mynde hys expulsyon from his naturall coūtre, not hauynge any comforte how he myght attayn to his former dignite, lastely resorted (wyth .xii. persones onely accompanyed) vnto the duke or ruler of that prouynce or countre.
                     For ye shall vnderstande that at those dayes (as testyfyeth Eutropiꝰ and other wryters) the Gallis occupyed dyuers countres. And therfore Titus Liuius, whych wrote ye actes and dedes of the Romayns, made disstynccyon of the Gallis / and nameth them that Brēne ladde, when he beseigyd the cytye of Rome and after ye capitoyll, Cenonenses Galli / which is to name the Gallis of that coūtre where the cytye of Cena than stode &amp; yet doth (as testyfyeth the authour of cronica cronicarū, and other) in a countre of Italy named at this day Etruria. The whiche cytye, as affermen the sayde authours, was fyrste buylded of the foresayde Gallis, in ye tyme of Brenne beyng theyr duke or leder, before the commynge or incarnacyon of Cryste .iii. hundred .lxxx. &amp; vi. yeres: whyche maketh the yere of the worlde folowynge the accompte of this worke .iiii. thousand .viii. hundred and .xiii. yeres.
                     Then yt foloweth in ye story, when Brenne was comen to the presence of the duke named by myne authour Gaufride Seginꝰ duke of Alebrog / the whyche is to vnderstande duke of Armorica, now named lytell Brytayne, as by Policronica and the englyshe cronycle is suffycyently declared / and shewed vnto hym his aduersyte &amp; trouble: ye sayd duke receyued hym into his courte. And for he was personable &amp; well maneryd, hauyng great experyence in hawkynge and huntynge, and other propertyes apperteynynge to a gentylman: he had hym in shorte whyle in especyall fauour before any noble man of hys courte. By meane wherof, he lastly maryed his doughter / vpon condycyon

that yf he dyed wythout Issuemale, that he then shuld be ruler of ye countre. And yf yt happened hym to haue an heyre male: that then yt not withstādyng, to ayde and helpe hym to recouer his lande before loste.
                     The whych condycyons well and suerly vpon the dukes partye, by the assent of ye nobles of his lāde assured: the said duke within cōpas of ye same yere dyed. After whose deth when by a conuenyent terme, yt was knowen that the duchesse his wyfe was not wyth chyld: all the lordes to Brēne dyd homage, &amp; became his men. To the whych lordes the more to wynne theyr loues, he departed mych of his tresour: and shortly after with theyr assente gadered a great armye / and so in all hast sayled into Britayne to make new warre vppon his brother Belyne / &amp; after a certayn tyme there landed. Of whose landyng when Belyne was enfourmed: he in all haste gaderyd his Brytons in great nomber, &amp; made towarde hym as to hys mortall enemye. But the moder of the two brethern named Cōnuuēna, or after the englysh boke Cornewey / consyderynge ye mortall hateryd attwene her two chylder, and in partye of theyr both persones: of a moderly and naturall pyty, went attwene her two sonnes, and vsyd her in such dyscrete maner and moderly cōpassyon, as shewyng her brestes and other demeanures, that at length she accorded them. After whych accorde both bretherne with theyr lordes and frendes sped them vnto Troynouant or London / and there after many thynges orderyd and made for the weale of ye land: they cōdescended &amp; agreed to lede theyr both hostes into Gallia for to subdue to them the sayde countre. And in as goodly haste as they might p̄pare for ye iourney, they toke shyppyng, &amp; so sayled into a parte of Gallia brennyng &amp; wastynge ye conntre without pyty. And as wytnessyth myn authour Gaufryde, in a shorte whyle they subdued a great parte of Gallia Italy and Germania.
                     But here I entend to leue the farther ꝓcesse of myn authour Gaufrid for so myche as here he varieth from other writers of authority, as Eutropius, Titus Liuiꝰ, &amp; other, that dyd great dilygence in writynge of ye dedys &amp; actes of the Romayns, and of other peple dwellyng at those dayes in Italia, Gallia, &amp; Germania. For where the sayd Gaufryde sayth, yt at such tyme Belyn and Brenne made warre in Italye / Gabius &amp; Porsena were at that day consules of Rome: that sayeng is farre dyscordaunt vnto the other foresayd authours. For as they afferme at the tyme whenne Brēne besegyd Rome, Claudiꝰ Emilius, &amp; Lucius Lucretius were consulis / &amp; Furius Camillus was at ye tyme dictatour of Rome / and none lyke vnto the other were cōsules many yeres before nor after.
                     But trouth yt is that the sayde .ii. bretherne dyd many great actes in ye forenamed countres / but not all accordynge wyth the sayeng of ye sayd Gaufride. For where he referreth all those dedys to bothe bretherne: the forenamed Titus Liuiꝰ spekyth but of Brenne onely, as yt shall some dele be touched hereafter. wherefore to folowe the moste wryters / when Belyn hadde dwelled a certayne of tyme wyth hys brother Brenne in those partyes: by agrement of them both, Belyn retourned into Britayn and Brenne remayned there.
                  
                  
                     THE .XXXI. CHAPITER.
                     WHen Belinus or Belyn was retourned into Brytayne: he repayred olde cytyes, and buyldyd vppon

the ryuer of Uske a cytye, and called yt Caeruske nere vnto the ryuer of Seuerne. This city was after namyd ye cyty of Legiōs, for so mych as ye legions of Romaynes were lodgyd wythin ye same citye / &amp; now yt is called Caerleon or Carleon. Also he buylded an hauen wyth a gate there ouer wythin Troynouāt / in ye summer or pynacle wheron was set a vessell of brasse / in the which was closyd the asshes of his brent body when he was dede. This gate was long after called Belyns or Belinꝰ gate / but at this day yt is called Belyngesgate.
                     In this whyle that Belinus was thus occupyed in Brytayne, his broder Brenne desyrous to wynne fame and honoure buylded in Italy and other partes of Gallia these cytyes and townes folowynge.
                     
                        Mediolana or Mylleyn in Lūbardy
                        Papya or Papy.
                        Burgamum or
                        Sena or ☞
                        Comum or
                        Briria or
                        Uerona or
                        Uincentia or ☞
                        Cremona or
                        Mantua or
                     
                     The whyche cytyes and townes were buylded of the Gallis, or at the leste new repayred, in the tyme that Brenne was theyr leder or duke / all be yt that some wryters wold meane that Comum &amp; Cremona were buylded after Brenne was dede. Policronica wytnessyth, that the Senons; whych he meaneth by ye Gallis dwellyng aboute the cytye of Sena / by ye ledyng of Brēnus ouercame the Romaynes .xi. myle from Rome, at the ryuer Albia, &amp; chasyd them to Rome and toke the city vnto the Capitoll / &amp; after leyd syege to ye same Capitol. And vppon a nyght whyle the wardeyns of ye Capitoll slepte: ye Frēshemen or Gallys by a waye vnder the erth / came into the Capitoll &amp; were lykely to haue wonne it. But a noble Romayne named Mallius or Manlius Torquatus, awoke by the cryēg or noyse of a gander or gāders. The which Manlius awakyng the other Romaynes, put of the Gallys. For whych cause ye Romayns long tyme after helde a feste of ganders, ye fyrst daye of Iune.
                     Neuerthelesse afterwarde they called it Inōs feste, for so mych as they thought that Iuno ye goddes had by her influence gyuen that grace vnto the ganders, that they shuld by theyr noyse awake the Romayns. But yet the Gallis or frenchmen held ye Romayns so short, yt they were cōpelled to gyue vnto Bren theyr duke a thousand poūde weyght of gold, as therof is wytnesse Titꝰ Liuius. And further more sayth ye sayd Liuiꝰ, that ye Gallis slewe of the senatours many in nomber, the whych fyrste they supposed hadde ben goddes bycause of theyr ryche apparell, whych they sat in. But shortly after this the forenamyd Furius Camillus, whiche was called agayne frō the citye of Ardea, where he was outlawed before, &amp; by the comontye of Rome in this nede made agayne dictatour.
                     The which pursued Brenne and his people, and to theym gaue batayll, sleynge of them a great multytude, and wanne from them all the golde and iewellys that before tyme ye Gallis hadde wonne of the Romaynes. The whyche dede was done, as wytnessyth the foresayd Titus Liuius, the yere after the buyldyng of Rome iii. hundred and .lxv. whych was the yere of the worlde, folowynge the accompt of this worke foure thousand viii. hundred and .xxxv: and before Crystys incarnacyon kepynge the same accompt .iii. hundred and .lxiiii.
                     
                        Then yt foloweth in the storye of Brenne, when he was thus dyscomfyted of the Romaynes: he tourned his people towarde the Macedones or Grekes, and dyuyded his people in two hostes. wherof he reteyned yt one with hym, and that other he sent into a countre called then Gallacia, and after Gallogreci, and lastly Galates. Then Brenne ouercame the Macedons with theyr duke Sosten̄ and after spoyled the goddes &amp; theyr temples / &amp; sayde in his game, ryche goddes muste gyue to men somedele of theyre rychesse. Also he spoyled the temple of the god Apolyne Delphicus standynge in the hyll of the mounte Parnasus. wherfore as testifyeth the wryter Policarpus: the people of that countre prayed to god for helpe / and sodaynly the erth beganne to quake, and a great parte of the hyll fell vpon the hoste of Gallis, and thē slew. And after that ensued and fyll to grounde hayle stones of suche greatnesse, yt yt slew one other great parte of the sayde hoste / &amp; duke Brennus was sore wounded: wher by he fyll in suche dyspayre, that he slew hym self with his owne swerde. No man shall wonder, though thys Apolyn toke wreche of thē that spoyled the goddes and theyr temples. For god sufferyd Apolyn to destroy many nacyons, because of theyr trespasses and euyll lyuynge. For yt is certayne that spyrytes of the eyre may vse theyr shrewdnes in thē that be of mysbyleue and vse euyll dedes. For grace is wythdrawen from such maner of men: wherfore the spirites haue the more power to hurte and greue them.
                     Then syns I haue here shewed vnto you the fyne or ende of Brennus, I shall nowe retourne my style vnto his brother Belynus, the whyche, as before is towched, endeuoryd hym aboute the weale of hys lande of Brytayne and his people duryng ye tyme of his reygne, in executyng of many notable dedes, the whyche for length of tyme I ouer passe: so that lastely he dyed and was buryed, as before is sayde at Belius or Belinus gate wythin Troynouante or London / when he had reygned wyth his brother and alone, after the most concordaūce of wryters .xxvi. yeres, leuyng after hym a sonne called Gurguyntus, Gurguynt Brabtruc, or aftersome wryters Gurguynt Barberous, whyche is to meane Gurguynt wyth the red berde.
                  
                  
                     THE .XXXII. CHAPITER.
                     GUrguintus or Gurguynt the sonne of Belyne, was made kynge of the lande of Brytayne, in the yere of the worlde foure .M.viii. hundred and .xxxiiii. This in the englyshe cronycle is named Corynbratus or Corynbatus. The whych for so myche as the trybute before graū
                        ted by Guilthdak kyng of Dēmark, vnto the kynges of Brytayne for a perpetuyty, was denayed: he arrayed his army and nauye, and sayled into Denmarke / and there wasted and harmed the countre wyth iron and fyre: in such wyse that at length the kynge of Denmarke, wyth the assent of his Baronage, graunted to paye and contynue the foresayde tribute yerely of a thousande poūde. After whyche vyctorye thus hadde of the Danys: he wyth great tryumphe retourned towarde Britayn. And in kepynge of hys course / he encountred wyth a nauye of .xxx. sayle besyde the yle of Orchades full of men and women / of whyche flote the chyefe captayne was called after moste wryters Bartholomew. The whyche when he was brought vnto

the kynges presence, shewyd that he wyth his people were putte or exyled out of the countre of Spayne, and were named Balenses / and had sayled longe tyme vppon the see, to the ende to fynde some prynce, that wold gyue to them a dwellynge place, and they to become his subiectys &amp; holde theyr lande of hym / besechynge the kynge to haue compassyon of them, and to graunt to them some place to enhabyte them in / &amp; that they shulde no lenger dwell in theyr shyppes, cōsyderyng theyr vytayle was spent by reason of theyr long lyeng vpon ye see. After whych request thus made by theyr captayne / the kyng with the aduyse of his barons, graunted vnto them a voyde and waste countre, whyche was and is the farthest ile of all the iles / towarde the weste / the whych yle as sayth the Englyshe cronycle, was then named Irelande, after the name of theyr captayn called in the Englyshe cronycle Irlamal. But who so wyll knowe the fyrste cause of the namynge of this yle Irlande: lette hym rede the .xxxii. and xxxiii. chapytres of the fyrste boke of Policronica / and there he shall fynd ye more certaynly of ye fyrst namynge therof, with many other thynges touchynge ye sayd yle, the whych I ouerpasse for length of ye mater. For there he shall be suffyciently enfourmed of that, and also of other thynges.
                     Then yt foloweth in the story, after this Gurguintus was retourned into his lande of Britayne: he ordeyned to be stablyshed &amp; kepte ye lawes made by his forefaders / &amp; exersysyd iustyce to his subiectes, and guyded his lande well and nobly by the terme, after moste wryters, of .xix. yeres / and then dyed, and was buryed at newe Troye or London, or at Caerleon / leuynge after hym a sonne named after myne authoure Guynthelinus, but after some he is named Guyntellius.

                     GUinthelinꝰ or Guintellius ye sonne of Gurguintus / was made kynge of Brytayne, in the yere of the world .iiii. thousande .viii. hundred and .liii. This is named in the englyshe cronycle Gwentolyne, the whyche guyded his lande and Brytons with great mekenesse and sobernesse. He hadde also a noble wyfe called Marcia, instructe and lerned in many scyēces / the whych amonge other noble dedys by her done, studyed and broughte forth a certayne good and conuenyent lawe amonge the Brytons / the whyche was named longe after the Marcyan lawe. This lawe for that yt was thought both good and necessary, Aluredus, whyche longe after was kynge of Englande, translated oute of Bretyshe into Saxon speche / and then was yt called after that translacyon in the Saxon tonge Marthehelage, whych is to meane the lawe of Marcia. To this womā for her wysdome was committed all the gouernaunce of the lande / in so myche, as wytnessyth myne authoure Gaufryde and other, she reygned as quene of Brytayne a certayne tyme after her husbande was dede. But the yeres of her reygne be accompted with the yeres of her husbande, or wyth the yeres of her sonne Sisillius / so that no tyme asserteyned is to her deputed or sette.
                     Then yt foloweth, whē this Guinhelinus hadde reygned well and mekely by the terme of .xxvi. yeres, he dyed and was buryed at newe Troy or London, leuyng after hym a son named Sisillius or Cecilius.

                     SIsillius or Ceciliꝰ the sonne of Guynthelinus, was made kynge of Brytayne, in the yere of the world .iiii. thousande .viii. hundred &amp; lxxix. This in the Englysh cronycle is named Seyzyl. Of whych no mencion nor worthy memory is made. Al be yt that Gaufryde meaneth, yt this Sisillius was but .vii. yeres of age when his father dyed. wherfore the charge of the realme was committed vnto Marcia his moder / the which guyded yt well and suffycyently tyll her sayde sonne came to his lawfull age, and then resygnyd to hym all ye rule: whyche so contynued / but how longe he reygned Gaufryde expressyth not. wherfore I now folowe the sayenge of the forenamed authoure called the Floure of historyes, which affermeth hym to reygne onely .vii. yeres / all be yt the Englyshe boke sayeth he reygned .xv. yeres, whyche agreeth not so well wyth the concordaunce of other historyes &amp; tymes.
                     This Sisillius, as Gaufryde wytnessyth, left after him a sonne named Kymarus / whome the englysh boke nameth Kymor.
                  
                  
                     THE .XXXV. CHAPITER.
                     RImarus the sonne of Sisillius / was made kynge of Brytayne, in the yere of the worlde .iiii. thousande .viii. hundred .lxxx. &amp; vi. This in the englyshe boke is called Kymor / of yt whych is made no mencyon nother of hys tyme of reygne, nor of his dedes.
                     For the more partye of wryters reherse in moste breuest &amp; shorteste maner, yt after Kimarꝰ reygned Elaniꝰ. After Elaniꝰ Morindus. But ye old cronycle, whych I haue before tyme spoken of sayth that this Kymarus, which he nameth Kymarchꝰ Elaniꝰ▪ was a wylde yonge man, and lyued after hys pleasure. wherfore as he was in his dysporte of huntynge, he was by his euyll willers slayne, whē he hadde ruled skarsly .iii. yeres.

                     ELanius the sonne of Kymarꝰ, as wytnessyth the foresayde Floure of cronycles, but the broder of Kimarus as sayth Gaufride / was made kynge of Brytayne, in the yere of the worlde foure thousand .viii. hundred .lxxx. and .ix. the whyche in the englyshe boke is named Howan. Of this also is no mēcyon made nor memory nother of acte nor of reygn, but as the forenamed olde cronycle sayth, that Kymarus and Elanius was one persone / and reygned as before is sayde: but the abouesayd writer called Floure of hystoryes sayth, he reygned fully two yeres.
                  
                  
                     THE .XXXVII. CHAPITER.
                     MOrindus the bastarde sonne of Elanius, as sayth Gaufryde and other / was made kynge of Brytayne, in ye yere of ye world foure thousande .viii. hundred .lxxx. and .xi. the whych in the englyshe cronicle is called Morwith. This as witnesseth Gaufryde, was goten vppon the concubyne of Elanius named Tanguestela, and was a man of worthy fame in dedys of chyualry / but he was so ouercome with wrath &amp; cruelnesse, yt lyghtly he slew all men that hym tened or angred. He was also beauteouse of persone and lyberall of gyftes / and wyth that he was of a meruelouse strength, in so mych that he had not his pere wythin his realm of any man of noble byrthe.
                     In his tyme came into Brytayne a prynce oute of a countre called Mauritania / the whyche countre at those dayes is assygned by Strabo ye wryter▪ to be betwene the kyngdomes of

Hungary, and of Beame / the whych prynce wyth his cruell &amp; fyers people wasted the lād of Britayne with iron and fyre wythout pytye. wherof Morindus beynge warned / in all haste gaderyd his people, and hym mette / and faught in such wyse, that he chasyd the sayde prynce agayne to the see, and toke many of his sowdyours as prysoners, the whyche in satysfyeng of his cruelnesse and tyranny, he caused to be put to deth in his syght by dyuerse maners of tormentes / as by heedynge, fleynge, brennynge, and other cruell execucyons. Lastely as testyfyeth Guydo de Columpna and other, this Morindus walkynge or rydynge vppon the see stronde espyed a wōderfull monstre, the whych of his corage and knyght hod he thought to sle. And by a māly corage and force assayled this monstre or beste, fyghtyng wyth yt a certayne of tyme. But in conclusyon he was deuoured and swalowyd of the sayd monstre: after he had reygned, after moste wryters, by the terme of viii. yeres / leuynge after hym, as wytnessyth Gaufryde, fyue sonnes, wherof the fyrste was named Gorbomānus: the secunde Archygallo, the thyrde Elidurus, the fourth Uigenius or Nigenius, and the fyfte or yongest, Peredurus.
                  
                  
                     THE .XXXVIII. CHAPITER.
                     GOrbamānus the fyrste sonne of Morindꝰ / was made king of Brytayne / in the yere of the world foure thousande .viii. hundred .lxxx. and .xviii. This in the englyshe cronycle ys named Granbodyan / the whyche as testifyeth Gaufryde, was a iuste and ryghtwyse man to ye goddes and to his people, and yelded to eyther partye that was his / that ys to say to his goddes he yelded due reuerence &amp; sacrifyce / and to the people iustyce &amp; equyte. And he renewed and repayred all olde temples thorough his realme, and buylded some newe. And in his tyme was more welth and plente in his realme, mych more thē was in any of his predecessours dayes. But fynally to ye great sorow of all his Brytons / he was taken wyth sykenesse, and dyed wythout issue of his body, when he hadde reygned after moste wryters by the terme of .xi. yeres.

                        rus the thyrde sonne of Morindus, and the brother of Archigallo / was by one assent of the

Brytons made kynge of Brytayne, in the yere of the worlde .iiii.M.ix. hundred and .xv. This in ye englyshe cronycle is named Hisider or Esodyr. The which became so myld and benygne to the Brytons, that they gaue to hym a surname, and called hym Elidure ye meke. For he amōge other dedys of mekenes, as he was vpon a daye in his dysporte of huntynge, in a wode nere vnto Caerbrāk or yorke called Calater, or after some wryters Caltras: he fande his elder brother Archigallo late kynge, maskelyng or wandrynge in the thykest of the woode / whome louyngly and charytably he in secrete maner conueyed vnto his owne mancyō into ye cytye then named Aldud or Acliut. And as affermeth myn authour Gaufryde, to thentent to brynge his brother to his former dygnytye as after foloweth: the sayd Elidurus fayned hym selfe syke / and in all haste sente his messagers aboute his realme to gather and assemble the Barons of his lāde. And when the daye of assemble was cōmyn, and his lordes accordynge to his commaundement were present: he called them one by one, as they were of honour, into his secrete cubycle or chamber / &amp; there by his wyse &amp; dyscrete wordes as well in benygne and louynge maner, as other wordes and countenaunce apperteynyng to his royall power and dygnyty / he gat graunte of his sayd lordes, that they shuld ayde &amp; strēgth hym to theyr powers, to brynge hys brother Archigallo to his former honour and regally. After which graūt by the lordes made: he assembled a counsayll of his Brytons at Caerbrank or yorke / &amp; there caused suche meanes to be made to the cōmons, that in conclusion when the sayd Elidurus hadde ruled the lande .v. yeres as kynge, he there resygned his crowne and all kyngly power vnto his sayde brother Archigallo.

                     WHen Archigallo was thus restored to his kyngly dygnyte, he remembred well the euyl lyfe that before tyme he had ladde, and the punishement which he had suffred for ye same. wherfore in eschewynge of lyke daunger: He chaunged all hys olde condicyons, and became a good and ryghtwyse man, mynystryng to the people equyte and iustyce / &amp; bare hym so nobly agayne his lordes and rulers vnder hym of his landes, that he was belouyd &amp; dradde of all hys subiectes / and so contynued duryng the terme of his naturall lyfe. But fynally he payde the dette of nature, when he hadde reygned nowe lastly after moste wryters .x. yeres / &amp; was buryed, as sayth the sayde olde cronycle at Caerbranke or yorke.

But his two yonger bretherne Uigenius and Peredurus, hauynge of hym indignacyon, that he was for his vertue and good gouernaūce so well fauoured with the Brytons: of malyce conspyryd agayne hym / &amp; gatheryd an army of soudiours, &amp; made a felde wyth hym. And in the felde toke hym, and commaūded hym vnto the towre of Troynouāt as sayth Gaufryde, there as a prysoner to be sauely kepte.

                     UIgenius and Peredurus ye yongest sonnes of Morindꝰ,

and bretherne of Elidurus before sayde / were ioyntly made kynges of Brytayne / in the yere of the worlde foure thousande .ix. hundred &amp; .xxxii. These two bretherne are named in ye engleshe cronycle Higanius and Petytur / the whych as testyfyeth Gaufryde departed ye land betwene thē, so yt all ye land from the water of Hūber westwarde, fyll to Uigenius or Nigeniꝰ: &amp; the other part of the land with also Albania or Scotlande, fyll vnto Peredurus. But after the saynge of Guydo de Columna, Uigenius or Nigeniꝰ was not kyng, but alonely Peredurus / the whych, as he sayth, helde his brother Elidurus in pryson by his owne assent, for so myche as Elidurus was not wyllyng to be kynge. And as affermeth the sayde Guydo / this Peredurus was cruell and tyrannous to the Britayns, and slew and entreated ye lordes in moste cruell maner. wherfore he became so odyous to them / that they rebelled agaynst hym and slew hym.
                     This sayeng contraryeth and enpugnyth myne authoure Gaufryde, sayeng yt Uigeniꝰ dyed after he had reygned .vii. yeres. After whose deth Peredurus seasyd all the lande into his owne rule / &amp; ruled yt wyth great sobernesse, in such wyse that he excelled or was preysed aboue all his brethern, so that Elidurꝰ was clene forgoten of the Brytons. The englysh cronycle also sayth that this Peredurus founded the town of Pikeryng. But fynally he was taken wyth sodayne sykenesse / whereof he dyed, when he had reygned wyth his brother and alone, after the accorde of moste wryters .ix. yeres / leuynge after hym no chylde to be his heyr.

And as wytnesseth the olde cronycle, and the englyshe cronycle / ye fore named Elidurus was buryed at Caerleyl or Karlele.

                     GOrbonianꝰ or Gorbomānus the sonne of Regny sonne of Elidure / was made kynge of Brytayne, in the yere of the worlde foure thousande .ix. hundred and .xlv. After whom succedyd Margan. After Margā Emerianꝰ brother to ye sayd Margan / the whyche Emerianus was depryuyd for his cruelnes. And after hym reygned .xx. kynges successyuely the one after the other / of the whyche, as sayth myn authour Guydo, is no mencyon made / eyther for theyr rudenesse, or ellys for crueltye or dyscordaunte meanes or maners vsed in ye tyme of theyr reygnes / the whyche mysorder clerkes disdayned to wryte or put in memory. And next the laste of these foresayd .xx. kynges succedyd Blegabridus a connynge musycyan: the whyche for his excellence in that facultye, was called of the Brytons god of glemen.
                     After Blegabridꝰ was thus kyng and dyed, succeded .ix. kynges / of whome for the former cōsyderacyon is nother name nor tyme of reygne put in memory. The laste of whyche ix. kynges was by the agremēt of all wryters named Hely / whych Hely after some wryters reygned .xl. yeres, &amp; after some but bare .vii. monethes. In the whych .xxxiii. kynges tymes, passed or flowed (that is to say from the laste yere of Elidure vnto the last yere of the foresayde Hely, as by the fornamed table apperyth) a hūdred and .lxxxvi. yeres. whyche sayde Hely lefte after hym .iii. sonnes, named Lud, Cassibellanus, and Neurius.
                  
                  
                     THE .XLVII. CHAPITER.
                     LUd the eldeste sonne of Hely, was made kyng of Brytayn, in the yere of ye worlde .v. thousand a hundred and .xxxi. This mā was honourable in all his dedes / for he edyfyed new temples, and repayred the olde. He also repayred olde cytyes &amp; townes / and specyally in the cytye of Troynouant he causyd many buyldynges to be made / and gyrde the sayde citye about wyth a strong wall of lyme and stone. And in the weste parte of the sayde walle he arreryd a fayre and stronge gate, and commaūded it to be called Luddys gate, whych at this daye is clepyd Ludde gate. And for he loued myche this cytye: he vsed myche &amp; moste to lye there. By reason wherof yt was called Caerlud or Luddys towne / and after by corrupcyon or shortynge of the speche, yt was named London, whych name at this daye remayneth and abydeth.
                     This Lud also, as wytnessyth Gaufryde, was strōge and myghty in armys in subduynge his enymyes. He was also lyberall of gyftes and plentuouse in his houshold / so yt he was myche loued and drad of his Britōs. But when he hadde contynued hys reygn with great honour by ye terme of .xi. yeres: he dyed, &amp; was buryed in his gate called Portlud or Ludgate / leuynge after hym, as wytnessyth Gaufryde, two sonnes, Androgeus, &amp; Temancius or Tenancius.
                  
                  
                     THE .XLVIII. CHAPITER.
                     CAssibellan the brother of Lud was made kyng of Brytayn, in the yere of the worlde .v. thousand a hundred and .xlii. For so myche as the .ii. sonnes before named of Lud were to yonge or insuffycyent for to take on hand so great a charge. But

as wytnessyth the olde cronycle, and also the authour of the Floure of historyes: thys Cassybellan was not made kynge, but ruler or protectour of the lande, for the tyme of the non-age of the foresayde brethern: all be yt myne authour Gaufryde sayth, yt after Cassibellan was sette in authorite / he became so noble and lyberall, that his name sprange farre / and by his exercysynge of iustyce, the Brytons ought to hym more fauour, thē to eyther of his neuewes. How be yt he cheryshed them, &amp; brought theym forth accordyng to theyr byrth. And when they came vnto yeres of dyscrecyon, he gaue to Androgeꝰ the cytye of London, wyth the dukedome or the erledome of Kent / and to Temancius the dukedome of Cornewayll.
                     In this season was Caius Iuliꝰ, the whyche is moste commonly called Iulius Cesar, sente by the senate of Rome as felowe and consull wyth Lucius Bubulus into Gallia nowe called Fraunce, for to subdue them vnto the empyre of Rome. The whyche Iulius beyng vppon the see syde, after he had ouercome the Gallis, and beholdyng the whyte clyues or rockes of Brytayne: enquyred of the countre, and what people dwelled therin. And when he was suffycyently enfourmed of all the commodytyes therof: he had great wyll to brynge the sayde countre vnder the yocke of the Romaynes, for so mych as at those dayes a great parte of the worlde was tributary to Rome. But as sayth myne authour, fyrste he exorted the Britons by writyng &amp; messagers, to gyue trybute vnto Rome. wherfore Cassybellan hauynge indygnacyon wrote vnto hym sharpe &amp; short answeres, shewyng that he and euery noble man was bounde specyally to kepe his coūtre from seruage / and to kepe his subiectes, that they myght enioy lybertye and franchise. The whyche to obserue, he wold do the vttermost of his power &amp; myght. wyth the which answere Iulius beynge nothynge cōtentyd, in all hast made redy his nauy and people, and sayled towarde Brytayne. And whē the Romaynes were comyn nere the land of Brytayne, &amp; shuld haue landed: ye Brytons pyght sharpe stakes and longe vppon the bankes / which causyd theym to wynne lande wyth great daunger. And not longe after theyr landynge, Cassibellan wyth a stronge hoste of Britons encountred the Romaynes / gyuynge or yeldyng to them suche fyght and batayll that they were fayne to resorte to theyr shyppes for theyr suertye. Not wyth standyng ye, as witnesseth Gaufride and other / Iulius after he hadde renewed his knyghtes, and also ryggyd his nauye: he came agayne the seconde tyme, entendynge to subdue the land to the empyre of Rome. But as before tyme he was by the manhode of the kynge and his Brytons manfully and knyghtly wythstāden and chasyd: so this seconde tyme he was in lyke wise ouercome, and compelled to flee wythout honoure. For whych vyctory thus twyes obteyned by the Brytons, Cassibellan entendynge to gyue thanke vnto his goddes, and rewarde to hys knyghtes: in goodly haste caused an assemble to be made of his lordes &amp; knyghtes at the cytye of Caerlud or London. where after dew obseruaunces done to theyr goddes, after ye vse of theyr pagan lawes, a great and solemne feste was holden by the kynge to all that wolde come, wyth moste lyberalytye and plentye in all that was necessarye to such a feste. And the more to encrease the kynges honoure / and to the more comforte and dilectacion of his lordes and other there beynge

present: there was all maner kynꝭ of games that at those dayes were exercysed and vsed. Contynewynge whyche feste, two noble and yonge knyghtes amonge other hapened to assey eyther other in wrastlyng / wherof that one was neuew to kyng Cassibellan named Hirelda / and ye other named Euelinus, was allyed vnto Androgeus erle or duke of London. By meane of this wrastlynge dyuysyon or vnfyttynge wordes fyll betwene the two yonge knyghtes, yt after wordes ensued strokes / by meane wherof partyes were takē on eyther syde, whyche ranne to gyder in great 
                           •
                        re and malyce, so that on eyther part many and diuers were hurte &amp; wounded. Among whome Hirelda neuew to the kynge was slayne / whych caused great dysturbaunce in the courte and amonge the lordes.
                     when the knowlege of the deth of Hirelda was brought vnto ye kyng: he was therwyth greatly amoued / &amp; entendynge dewe iustice to be hadde &amp; mynystred by thaduyce of his Barons, causyd the forenamed cosyn of Androgeus Euelinus to be sommoned for to appere before hym &amp; hys counsayll, and there to acquyte hym of suche cryme as to hym was layde for the deth of Hirelda before slayne. But Euelinus by coūsayll of Androgeus wythstode that commaundement / and shortly after the sayde Androgeus and Euelyne departed the courte wythoute takynge leue of the kynge.
                     The kynge dysdaynynge this demeanure of Androgeꝰ / after dyuers monycyons to hym gyuen, gathered his knightes and made warre vpon Androgeus. wherfore he cōsyderyng after many ways &amp; meanes thought yt he was not of power to wythstand the kynges great indignacyon / sent his letters vnto Caius Iuliꝰ Cesar, shewynge to hym the circumstaunce of the mater / and aduoydynge hym of all gylt, besought and prayed him in moste humble wyse, that he wolde shortly retourne wyth his army into Brytayne / &amp; he wyth his hole power shuld be redy to ayde and helpe hym agayne the Brytons.
                     Of this message was Iulius very glad / and in all haste made towarde Brytayne wyth a great power. To whom ye wynde was so fauourable / yt in short tyme after this message he drew nere ye land. But as affermeth myne authour Gaufryde / or he wold lande, ferynge the treason of Androgeus, he receyued frō hym in hostage his sonne named Scena, wyth .xxx. other of the moste noble of his lordshyppe / &amp; that done he landed wyth the helpe and ayde of Androgeus. wherof when Cassibellan hadde warnynge, in all haste he made towarde the Romaynes / and in a valey nere vnto Dorobernia now named Canterbury, there he foūde the hoste of ye said Iuliꝰ lodged, &amp; with him Androgeꝰ with all his power. After whych knowlege had eyther of other / wyth theyr habyllemētes of warre eyther greued other, tyll at lēgth both hostꝭ mette hande for hand and faught vygerously, in such wise that many fell on eyther partye.
                     But when the Brytons, as sayth Gaufryde, hadde longe foughten &amp; knyghtly defended the Romaynes: Androgeꝰ with his peple came by a wynge of the Brytons / and them so sharpely assayled, that they were constreyned to forsake the feld and place yt they before had kepte. The whiche flyght dyscōforted so the other, that fynally all fledde and gaue place to the Romaynes, the which pursued &amp; slewe them withoute pytye. So that Cassibellan wyth his Brytons that were lefte, were fayne to gette them

to a place of suerty / there to reste tyll they myght newly prouyde to wyth stande theyr enemyes.
                     But fynally as all wryters agre, Iulius helde the kyng so shorte, that for an vnytye and concorde he was fayne to become trybutary to the Romaynes, and to paye to them yerely a certayne trybute, whych Gaufryd affermeth to be .iii. thousande poūd. And when the sayde trybute was set in a suertye / so that the sayd Romaynes were wyth yt contented, and Iulius hadde accomplyshed his wyll &amp; pleasure in thynges to hym thought necessary: he with Androgeus departed the lande, and so spedde hym towarde Rome / where soone after he was agayn, by the will of ye most of ye senatours made emperour. And this tribute thus was graūted when Cassibellan hadde reygned as kynge of Britayne fully .viii. yeres and more.

                     THE .LI. CHAPITER.
                     NOwe then haue I shewyd to you how that Iulius Cesar by ayde and helpe of Androgeus erle of Kent / made this land of Brytayn trybutarye to the Romaynes, when Cassibelan had ben kyng of the sayd lande vppon .ix. yeres / whych .ix. yeres I haue sette for the ende of the seconde parte of this worke. So that

the .x. yere of Cassibellan is the fyrst yere of the thyrde parte of the sayde worke. Then as all writers testyfye / Cassibellan contynued after the departynge of Iulius, as kyng by the terme or space of .vii. yeres, as before is declared. In the tyme of ye whych vii. yeres is none noble acte nor dede of hym put in memory or wrytynge.
                     But for some wold thynke that after Caius Iulius Cesar, hadde thorough helpe of Androgeus erle of Kent, and eldest sonne of Lud, thus as before is sayde, subdued Cassibellan: that the sayd Iulius wold haue restoryd the sayde Androgeus to the crowne of Brytayne, as his ryghtfull inherytaūce / and clerely to haue expelled and put oute the sayd Cassibellan from all kyngly dygnyty. To this answereth the olde cronycle and sayth, that Cassibellan was not the sonne of Hely, but that he was the eldeste sonne of Lud, by reason wherof he was fyrste made kyng / and so as ryghtfull heyre contynued durynge hys lyfe, kynge of Brytayne. The whych when he hadde reygned .ix. yeres or he were trybutary, and .vii. yeres after as affermeth the sayde olde cronicle in all .xvi. yeres / he thē dyed wythoute issue, and was buryed at Caerbranke or yorke.
                  
                  
                     THE .LII. CHAPITER.
                     TEmanciꝰ or Tēnancius the yongest sonne of Lud, as affermeth Gaufryde, was made kyng of ye Brytōs, in the yere of the world fyue thousande a hundred and .lvii. This is named in the englyshe cronycle Tormace, and not kynge, as the sayde boke affermeth. But his elder brother, whych in the sayde boke is named Androgen, was after the affyrmaunce of the sayd englyshe cronycle made kynge. But the foresayd Gaufryde and other testyfyen / that for so myche as Androgeus feryd to be euer hated of ye Brytons, for his treason wroughte agaynst the kyng and the lande: he therfore chase to go with Caius Iulius to Rome, rather thē to be kyng of such as he thought wolde neuer haue hym in theyr loue and fauoure.
                     Then yt foloweth in ye storye, this Tēnācius ruled the land with great dylygence and iustyce / and defended the lande well and knyghtly agayne all alyaūtis and straūgers / &amp; payde his trybute to the Romaynes y• Cassibellan had graunted / and lastly dyed when he had reygned after most wryters .xxiii. yeres, and was buryed at Caerlud or London / leuynge after hym a sonne, the whyche was called Kymbeline.
                  
                  
                     THE .LIII. CHAPITER.
                     Kymbelinus or Kymbelyne the sonne of Tēnancius / was of ye Brytōs made kynge, in the yere of the worlde .v. thousande a hundred and .lxxx. This man as wytnesseth Guydo was brought vp at Rome amonge the Romaynes, &amp; there made a knyght / and had of them suche fauoure, that he was at lyberty to pay the trybute or not. Of hym is lytell memorye made / excepte all wryters agreen, that in ye season that he was kynge, our sauyoure Cryste Iesus was incarnate of that moste blessyd virgine our lady saynt Mary. which shulde be to accorde historyes, in the xix. yere of his reygne.
                     Of the reygne of this Kymbelyn authours wryte dyuersly / so yt some shewe no yeres, and some but fewe, whych can not accord wyth the tyme of other cronycles. But the authour of the hystorye called Floure of historyes wytnessyth, yt he reygned .xxxv. yeres. The whyche sayeng who lyst to se ye table before rehersed: he shall

there haue knowlege, that this sayd auctoure accordeth beste wyth other storyes and cronycles.
                     And when that this Kymbelyne had reygned gloryously ouer ye Brytons by all the season before expressyd, he dyed &amp; was buryed at Caerlud or London / leuynge after hym two sonnes named Guyderius and Aruiragus.
                     NOw before haue I shewed vnto you in ye later chapyter, yt Criste was incarnate, in the .xix. yere of Kymbelyne / whyche maketh the yere of the worlde, that is to saye frō the fyrste creacyon of Adam to the incarnacyon .v. thousande a hundred lxxx. and .xix. the whyche accompt is approuyd by holy Isodore, Beda, and other.
                     
                        Then Cryste was incarnate the yere of ye world, as before is expressed.
                        From Noes flood or after .ii. thousande ix. hundred and .lvii.
                        After Abraham .ii thousande &amp; .xvii.

                        And in the begynnyng of ye .xlii. yere of Octauius Augustus, then emperour of Rome.
                     
                  
                  
                     THE .LIIII. CHAPITER.
                     GUyderius the fyrste sonne of Kymbalyne / beganne his reygne ouer the Britons, the yere of the worlde .v. thousande .CC. &amp; .xvi. And the yere after Cristes incarnacyon ye xvii. yere. This man was welthy &amp; trusted mych in his strēgth. And for he thought the Romayns hadde the forenamed trybute with wronge: he therfore of a knyghtly courage denyed to the Romaynes the sayde trybute. wherfore Claudiꝰ whych was vncle vnto Caius Caligula the .iiii. emperour of Rome: came into Brytayne with a great armye of Romaynes / &amp; as wytnessyth Policronica, cō
                        queryd and wanne agayne the sayde trybute wythout great fyght. And yt done / he also subdued the yles of Orchades or Orkeys, whych stande beyonde Scotlād within the great Occean / and after tourned agayne to Rome the .vi. moneth after that he came thens.
                     The cronycle of Englande, and also Gaufryde saye, that in the hoste of the Romaynes was a captayne named Hame or Hamo / the whych entendynge hurte and destruccyon of ye Brytons, chaunged his shelde or armure, &amp; dyd vppon hym the armure of a Britayne. And by that meane as a Briton mysclad, he entred into the thyckest of the hoste / and lastely vnto the place where as kynge Guyderius faught, &amp; shortly after slewe the kynge. But Aruiragus seynge this sodayne myschyefe, to the ende yt the Brytons shulde not gyue backe: he hastely causyd hym selfe to be armed wyth the cognysaunce of the kynge. And so for kyng cōtynued the fyght, wyth such māhode, that the Romaynes were put to flyght.
                     Thus by accorde of wryters Guyderius was slayne of the foresayde Hamo / when he hadde reygned ouer the Brytons by the concordaunce of other hystoryes .xxviii. yeres, leuyng after hym none heyre of his body to guyde the lande after his deth.
                  
                  
                     THE .LV. CHAPITER.
                     ARuiragus the yongest sonne of Kymbelyne, and brother

to Guyderius before slayn, was ordeyned kyng of Brytons, in the yere of our lorde .xliiii. This in the englyshe boke is named Armager / the whyche as there is shewed, well and knyghtly maynteyned the warre agayne the Romayns, and after slew the forenamed Hamo nere vnto an hauen or porte of the see. And hym so slayne, threwe gobet meale into the same see. And for this skyll, was this hauē longe tyme after called Hamōs hauen / whych at this daye is called Southampton.
                     Then yt foloweth in the .viii. chapyter of the .iiii. boke of Policronicon, that Claudius after dyuers happes of batayll, toke Aruiragꝰ to his grace / &amp; brought his doughter Gennissa by name from Rome, and maried her vnto Aruiragus. And for he wolde make the place of ye maryage more solemne, he therfore called the towne of mariage Claudiocestria after his name, the whych before was called in bretyshe tunge Caerleon, &amp; after Glouernia after a duke of Demecia that hyght Glorio / but nowe this towne is named Glouceter.
                     All otherwyse telleth the englyshe cronycle / &amp; sayth that Armager scomfyted Claudius, and compelled hym to gyue his doughter Gēnissa or Gē
                        nen to the sayde Armager to wyfe / wyth condycyon that the Romayns shulde neuer after that daye clayme any trybute of Brytayne, excepte alonely feawte / whyche sayenge appereth doutefull for dyuers causes. wherof one is, that the sayde Armager shulde not constrayne Claudius to gyue his doughter to hym / for so myche as the sayde Armager hadde neuer seen the sayde Gennen before tyme, nor knewe not of her cō
                        uersacyon. Then meruayle yt were, that he shulde force her father to gyue hym a wyfe, that he hadde cast no loue vnto before tyme. One other reason is, that the sayde cronycle testyfyeth / that after he hadde maryed the sayd Gennen, he was at London crowned kynge of Englande. For I wold thinke if he had ouercomē Claudius, as there is surmytted, he wold fyrste haue crowned hym selfe kyng, and then haue maried his doughter. But by the same reason yt certifyeth more strenger the former sayenge of Policronica. For by all lykelyhode Claudius wold not suffer hym to be crowned kyng, tyll he hadde full perfourmed his promyse in maryage of his doughter.
                     And all be yt that myne authoure Gaufryde varyeth not myche from the englyshe cronicle: I thynke in ye doynge he toke example of Homerꝰ, that wrote the dedis and actes of the Grekes / the whyche shewed and put in memory all the noble actes by thē done, and specyally in the recuyll or boke made by hym of the syege of Troye. But the other dedys concernynge theyr dyshonoure / he hyd yt as mych as he myght. And in lyke maner do many other writers, which I passe ouer. And so Gaufride for he was a Bryton, he shewed the beste for Brytons.
                     Then yt foloweth, after the solemnysacyon of this maryage, whyche was with all honour finyshed: Claudius sente certayne legyons of his knyghtes into Irlande to rule that countre, and retourned hym selfe to Rome.
                  
                  
                     THE .LVI. CHAPITER.
                     IT was not longe after the departynge of Claudius: but yt Aruiragus rode aboute his realme, and wyth great dylygence repayred cytyes and townes before decayed &amp; broken wyth the strength of the Romaynes / and entreated his subiectes

wyth suche iustyce and good order, that they loued and drad hym more then any of his progenitours. This in tracte of tyme made hym welthy. And by meane of this welthynes ensued pryde / so yt hym thought great shame to be vnder the rule or guydynge of ye Romayns / wherfore lastly he denyed the tribute before graū
                        ted. wherof when knowlege came vnto ye senate of Rome: in all hast was sent a duke of Rome called Uespasyan, wyth a certayne of legyons to subdue Aruiragus.
                     ye shall vnderstand, that a legyon of knyghtes, is .vi. thousande .vi. hundred .lxvi.
                     when Uespasyan was landed in Brytayne, as testyfyeth Polycronica / he spedde hym so, that in shorte whyle he subdued Aruiragus to the empyre, and causyd hym to graunte payment of the foresayde trybute. which was done, as sayth Gaufride by entreatye of the quene Gennissa, and of no constraynt nor coaccyon.
                     when Uespasyan hadde thus recoueryd the trybute, he then also made subiecte to the empyre / an yle in the see lyenge vpon the southsyde of Britayne, now called the yle of weyght, and after retourned to Rome.
                     when Aruiragus was thus secondely brought vnder the yocke of ye Romayns: he became more mylde towarde them / so that whyle he lyued after he payed hys trybute wyth lesse grudge, and contynued hym in theyr fauours, in suche wyse that he was of theym well beloued. And so lastely dyed when he hadde ruled the Brytōs well and nobly by the terme of .xxx. yeres / and was buryed at Caerglon̄, Caerleon̄, Claudiocestria, or Glouceter / leuynge after hym a sonne named Marius ⸫
                  
                  
                     THE .LVII. CHAPITER.
                     MArius the sonne of Aruiragꝰ was ordeyned kynge of Brytons, in the yere of our lorde .lxxiiii. This in the cronycle of Englande is named westmer. whych Marius, as wytnessyth Gaufryde, was an excellent wyse man / and guyded his Brytons moste honourably, and in grete prosperyte and welthe. In the tyme of the reygne of this Mariꝰ a duke or kynge of a nacyon called Pyctes / whych as wytnessyth Uirgilius, are descendyd of a people called of olde tymes Scythis. They also are named Gothis or Hunys. This foresayde leder of Pictes is named of Gaufryde Londricus / the which landed wyth a great nauy, in the prouynce of Albania now called Scotlande / and yt beganne to waste with iron and wyth fyre. wherof whē Marius was warned / he in all haste assembled his knyghtes, and made towarde his enymyes / and gaue vnto them stronge batayll. In the whych Lōdricus or after some Rodicꝰ was slayne, and a great parte of his people were slayne. In remembraunce of whyche vyctorye, kynge Marius lette arrere a great stone / and in this he commaunded to be grauen Marii victoria, whych is to meane the victorye of Marius.
                     wyllyam of Malmesburye sayth, that this stone was arered in mynde of Marius the consull of Rome.
                     The englyshe cronycle sayth, that this batayll was foughtē in a place, the whyche now is called Stanysmore. But where so this stone is set / the countre there aboute was longe after called westmaria, and nowe westmerlande.
                     Then yt foloweth in the story, that

when the resydue of the people of Lodricus, whyche were fledde from the felde, vnderstode that theyr hedde &amp; captayne was slayne: they made hū
                        ble request vnto ye kynge, yt he wolde accepte thē vnto his grace / and that he wold graunt to theym some lande and countre to dwell in. whych graū
                        ted vnto thē a place in the ferre ende of Scotlande, whyche is named of myne authoure Cathenesia, where the sayd Scythis or Pictes fyrst inhabyted them. And for so myche as the Brytons dysdayned to gyue vnto thē theyr doughters in maryage: therfore they acqueynted them wyth the Iryshe men, and maryed theyr doughters, and grewe in proces into a great people. And for this allyaunce attwene the Iryshe and them: theyr countre, as wytnessyth Policronycon ye .xxxvii. chapyter of hys fyrste boke, was called Irlande, and after Pictauia, &amp; lastely Scotlande.
                     And when Marius had thus subdued his enemyes / he attendyd and sette his mynde to the common wele of this lande and subiectes / and contynued ye resydue of his lyfe in great tranquillite and reste. And so lastely payde his naturall tribute, &amp; was buryed at Caerleyll, leuyng after hym a sonne named Coillꝰ or Coyll, whē he hadde reygned after moste wryters .lii. yeres.
                  
                  
                     THE .LVIII. CHAPITER.
                     COyllus the sonne of Marius was after the deth of his father made kynge of Brytons, in the yere of oure lordes incarnacyon a hū
                        dred and .xxvi. This was from hys infancy noryshed and brought vppe amonge the Romaynes in Italia or Rome / by reason wherof he was to theym louynge and kynde, and they vnto hym. And he, for so myche as he knewe the power of the Romayns great / in auoydyng of warre &amp; other daunger, payde vnto them the foresayde trybute duryng his lyfe. This Coillus also, as wytnessyth Gaufryde, was a lyberall man of gyftes / by reason wherof he obteyned great loue of his nobles, and also of his cō
                        mons. And as some authours haue: this Coyll made the towne of Colchester / whych at this daye is a fayre town in the shyre of Essex. But other ascrybe yt to Coell or Coill, that was kynge nexte after Asclepeodotus.
                     But when this Coillus hadde reygned in soueraygne peace by ye terme of .liiii. yeres, he dyed and was buryed at Caerbrank or yorke / &amp; lefte after hym a sonne, the whyche was named Lucius or Lucy.
                  
                  
                     THE .LIX. CHAPITER.
                     LUcius or Lucy the sonne of Coillus, was made kynge of Brytons, in the yere of oure lorde a hundred and .lxxx. The whych in all actes and dedes of goodnes folowed his forefaders / in suche wyse that he of all men was beloued and drad. Of this is litell or none acte notable put in memorye / excepte that all wryters agree, that this Lucius sent to Eleutherius then pope of Rome certayne pystles or letters, prayeng hym that he &amp; his Britons myght be receyued to the fayth of Crystes chyrche. wherof the pope beynge very ioyous and gladde / sente into Brytayne two noble clerkes named Faganus and Dunianus: or after some, Fugacius and Dimianus. These two good and vertuous clerkes were honourably receyued of Lucius / the whych by theyr good doctryne and vertuous examples gyuynge, cōuertyd the kynge and a great parte of the Brytons.
                     But for so myche authours &amp; wryters

wryte dyuersly of ye tyme of this receyuynge of the fayth by Lucius / so that the one varyeth greatly from the other: therfore I haue shewed in the forenamed table, that yt shall vnder correccyon appere, yt the fayth was receyued by Lucius, as affermeth Petrus Pictauiens. the .viii. yere of the reygne of the sayde Lucius. And yt yere after Cristes incarnacion a hundred &amp; .lxxxviii. The whych Lucye after the fayth thus by hym receyued, by the aduyce of the foresayde clerkes, and wyth the instruccyons sent to theym by the foresayde pope Eleuthery: instituted and ordeyned, that all or the more partye of Archeflamynys and flamynys / whyche is to meane archbysshoppes and bysshoppes of the pagan lawe, whyche at that daye were in nomber, as wytnessyth Gaufryde and other .iii. of the archeflamynys, and .xxviii. of the flamynys / were made and ordeyned archebyshoppes &amp; byshoppes of ye chyrch of Criste, as after foloweth.
                  
                  
                     Archeflamynys byshoppes constytuted.
THE .LX. CHAPITER.
                     THe fyrste of the archeflamynys see, rule, or iurysdyccyō / was as wytnessyth Gaufride &amp; Policronica, at London, the seconde at yorke, and the thyrde at Caerurst or Kaerglon̄ or Glouceter. To these .iii. archbyshopes were subiecte the foresayd .xxviii. flamynys or byshoppes. To the archebyshoppes see of London was subiecte Cornewayll and all myddel England vnto Humber. To the archebyshoppes see of yorke was subiecte all Northumberlande, from the bowe of Humber, wyth all Scotlande. And to the thyrde archbyshoppes see, whych was at Glowceter, was subiecte all walys. In whych prouynce of walys were .vii. byshoppes, where as now ben but iiii. And at ye daye Seuarū departed Brytayne and Cambria or walys. But in the tyme of Saxons, after they had the rule of the lande of Brytayne, as testyfyeth wylhelmus de Pontific, all be yt that saynt Gregory had graunted vnto London pryuylege of that archbishoppes see: neuerthelesse saynt Austayn, the which wyth other was sent into Englande by the foresayde Gregorye, tourned the archebyshoppes see out of London into Caunterbury, after the deth of saint Gregory, by meanes of prayer of kyng Egbert or Ethelbert, and other cytyzeyns &amp; burgesys of Caunterbury / where yt hath contynued to this daye / except that for the tyme of Offa kynge of Mercia or Mercheryk, for dyspleasure that he hadde to the cytezeyns of Caunterburye bynāme and toke from theym that dygnyte / and worshypped Adulphe bysshop of Lychefelde wyth the pall of Caunterbury by the assent of Adryan the fyrste of that name then pope. Neuerthelesse in the tyme of Kenulphus, whyche not longe after was kynge of the sayde Mercia or Mercheryk / yt was agayne restoryd to Caunterbury.
                     The worshyp of ye see of yorke hath endured there alwaye and yet dothe, though Scotland be withdrawē frō his subieccyon. The archbyshoppes see of Caerglon̄ or Glowceter, was tourned frō thēs to Menenia, whych is in ye west syde of Demecia vppon the Iryshe see, whiche now is called saynt Dauids lande. In this prouynce from the dayes of saynt Dauid, vnto the dayes of Sampson bysshop / sat .xxiii. byshoppes. But in the sayde Sampsons dayes then archebyshop, fyll such mortalyte thorowe

walys of the yelowe euyll called the Iaundyes / that myche people therof dyed. wherfore the sayde Sampson toke wyth hym the pall, &amp; sayled into Armorita or lytell Brytayne / and was there bysshoppe of Dolence or Dolences. And from that tyme vnto the fyrst Henry
                           •
                        s tyme kyng of Englande / hadde sytten at Menenia or saynte Dauids .xxi. byshoppes, and all wythoute pall. But whether yt were for lacke of connynge, or ellys for pouerty, it is not asserteyned. Neuerthelesse alwaye from the tyme of the sayde Sampson vnto the foresayde Henry the fyrste tyme / all the byshoppes of wales were sacred of ye byshoppe of Menenia or saynte Dauids. And the archebyshop of Menenia was at all tymes sacred of ye bysshoppes of walys, as of his suffragans, and made no profession nor obieccyon to any other chyrche. But after these dayes other byshoppes yt sat there / were compelled to be sacred at Canterbury. In token of whyche subieccyon Bonyface archbyshoppe of Caūterbury, &amp; legate of the crosse / sange in euery cathedrall chyrche of walys a solemne masse, whyche was done by the sayde Boniface in the tyme of Henry the seconde beynge kynge of Englande.
                     But now ye shall vnderstāde there ben but two prymates or archbysshoppes in all Englande and walys. That one ys at Caunterburye, and that other is at yorke. To the prymate of Caunterburye ben subiecte xiii. byshoppes in England, and .iiii. in walys. And the prymate of yorke hath but two suffragans in Englād, which be the byshoppes of Caerleyll and Durham.
                     And who so wyll be further instructe of the order and chaūges of bysshoppes see of Englande lette hym rede ouer the .lii.liii.lv.lvi. and lvii. chapyters of the fyrste boke of Polycronycon / or a ꝑte of holy Bedys work, whyche he compyled of the same mater called historia Anglicana: and there he shall haue euery thyng sette out clerely and truely.
                     And for to contynewe my processe of Lucius as wytnessyth myne authoure Gaufride / when he hadde, as before ys sayde stablyssyd &amp; orderyd the foresayde archeflamyns and flamyns / and that they were also confermed of the pope: he then endowed them wyth such landes and possessyons, as before tyme were occupyed or gyuen to the maynteynynge and vpholdynge of the pagan rytes and lawe vsyd before tyme. And the temples of idollys thorough his land he causyd to be dedycate to Iesu Criste and his sayntes / &amp; honoured them wyth myche great and large gyftes. And when he had done, after moste accorde of wryters by ye terme of .xii. yeres: he dyed and was buryed in ye cytye of Claudiocestre or Glouceter without heyre of his body / the which after grewe to great damage of the Brytons, as after shalbe shewed.
                     Of this Lucius yt is shewed in a table hangynge vpon the wall of the north syde of the yle, in the backe of the quere of saynte Paules chyrche in London / that the sayde Lucius reygned ouer the Brytons .lxxvii. yeres. And ouer that the authoure of cronica cronicarum testyfyeth, that after Lucius had receyued the fayth, he assembled a great hoste of Brytons and sayled ouer into Gallia or Fraunce / and thens into other countres passynge by Becia and the cytye called Augusta / &amp; there subdued many of the enymyes of Crystes fayth / where after many vertuouse dedys he restyd in good peace. And his suster called Emerita, as sayth the said authour, was also martyred for Cristes

sake. But of this sayeng &amp; other the doute is assoyled in the foresayde table in ye begynnyng of this worke / where yt shall apere, that he reygned but .xii. yeres, as aboue is shewed.
                     And for so myche as in this Luciꝰ endeth for a tyme the lyne of Britōs, and the lande after this daye was ruled some dele by the Romayns: therfore I will here ende the thyrd parte of this worke. And for ye good spede I haue hyderto had / and to the ende to inpetre the more grace in accomplyshyng ye other dele of this worke: I here salute our moste blessyd lady wyth the thyrd ioye of the foresayde vii. ioyes, whyche begynneth.

                     This thyrde parte to be accompted from the ende of the .ix. yere of Cassibellan, to the laste yere of Lucius, includeth of yeres two hūdred &amp; .xli.
                     TRouth yt is, as affermyn all wryters / that after the deth of the forenamed Luciꝰ, for so mych as of his body remayned non heyre: the Brytons amonge them selfe fyll at great dystaunce and warre. The whyche warre and trouble endured to the greate dystourbaunce of the lande. But howe longe, the certayne is not sette out by any wryter that I haue seen / excepte the englyshe cronycle sayth, that yt endured .l. yeres. The whych sayeng vnder correccyō can not stande wyth the concordaūce of other writers / as yt is more playnly declared in the foresayde table. where also yt shall appere, that the sayde dyscorde amonge the Britons contynued but onely .xv. yeres.
                     After whyche terme of .xv. yeres expyred, as after more clerely shall be shewed: Seuerus beynge thē emperour of Rome, beganne his domynyon ouer this lande of Brytayne. So that ye shall nowe vnderstande that ye laste yere of this discorde was the yere of our lorde two hundred &amp; vii. By reason wherof yt foloweth, that the sayde .xv. yeres ioyned vnto the foresayde thyrde parte: that the thyrde part cōteyneth and includeth of yeres .ii. hundred and .lvi.
                  
                  ¶Thus endeth the thyrde parte.

                     THE .LXI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        SEuerꝰ a Romayn at this daye emperour of Rome / begane to rule this lande of Brytayn in the yere of our lordes incarnacyon .ii. hūdred and viii. The whych as wytnesseth Gaufryde, was before tyme sent from the senate of Rome with two legyons of knyghtes into Brytayne, to appease the warre and stryfe amonge them / and also for to wythstāde the Pictes and other enymyes, whych dayly inuaded the land. For dyuers wryters agree, that this Seuerꝰ was made emperoure, the yere of Crystes incarnacyon a hūdred .lxxx. and .xv / and ruled the sayd empyre after the most wryters .xvi. yeres. By whych rule yt shuld appere that he shuld be takē for gouernour of this realme of Brytayne, the .xii. yere of his empyre.
                     
                        It is sayde of this man, that after he had subdued the Parthis and the Arabis, he was named Particus / &amp; was sent, as before is sayde, of the senate of Rome into Brytayne / where he causyd to be made at the coste of the commoute, a walle of turues and great stakes of the length, as wytnes syth Policronica of a hundred &amp; .xii. myles / as in the .xviii. chapyter of his .iiii. boke apperyth. This wall after the exposycyon of the sayde Polycronica, began at the ryuer of Tyne, and enduryd to the Scottyshe see / or from the ende of the lordshyp of Deira, vnto the sayde Scottyshe see / or after some wryters from Durham, to the see beforesayde.
                     Then yt foloweth, the Pictes with theyr leder Fulgenius / issued from Albany or Scotlande into the lande of Brytayne / and destroyed myche of ye coūtre beyonde Durham. wherfore this Seuerus with and hoste of Brytons and of Romaynes mette wyth the sayde Fulgenius in a place nere vnto yorke, where after sore fyght the sayd Seuerus was slayn / when he hadde ruled this lande after moste concordaunce of wryters by ye terme of .v. yeres / and was after buryed at yorke, leuynge behynde hym two sonnes, that one named Geta, and that other Bassianus.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXII. CHAPITER.
                     BAssianus the sonne of Seuerus and of the moders syde a Bryton / beganne to rule this lande of Britayne in the yere of Cirstes incarnacyon two hundred and .xii. Of this man spekyth nothynge the englyshe cronycle. But trouth yt is, as wytnessyth Gaufride and other, that after / ye deth of Seuerꝰ stryfe arose betwene the Brytons &amp; the Romaynes, then beynge wythin the land of Brytayne. For the commons helde for theyr kynge Bassianus, for so myche as he was borne of a Bryton woman. And vpon that other party in lyke maner the Romayns alowed Geta for theyr kyng, because he was descended of a Romayne. And as far ther affermeth the forenamed Gaufryde / for this dyscencyon a batayll was hadde betwene the sayd two bretherne / in ye whych Geta was slayn, and Bassianus remayned for kynge of all the lande.
                     But frō this sayeng varyeth greatly Eutropius, and other that wryte of the cronycles of Rome. For by thē yt is witnessed, that Geta was slayn at a cytye named Edessa, when he faught agayne the Parthiens / and Bassianus succedyd his fader in the dignyte of emperoure / which as in ye sayde cronycle of Rome is testyfyed, was also called Marcus Aurelius Antonnius and Caracalla a man of ryght euyll condycyon, and vnreasonable of lechery, so yt he laye by his stepdame named Iuliana and weddyd her, and dyd other many cruell dedys / and lastely he was slayne at the forenamed cytye of Edessa, when he had ben emperour vpō .vii. yeres.
                     In the tyme that Bassianus was thus kynge of Brytayne, one named Carassius a Bryton of lowe byrthe, but valyant and hardy in mercyall dedys: purchaced of the senate of Rome the kepynge of ye costes of Brytayne, and to wythstāde the malyce of straungers, as Pictes and other. By meane of this, Carassius drewe vnto hym many knyghtes, &amp; specyally of the Brytons / promysynge to them, yt if they wold make hym kyng he wolde clerely delyuer them from all seruytude of ye Romaynes. where thorough ye Britons (as wytnessyth Gaufryde) rebelled agayne Bassianus / and wyth theyr duke and leder Carassius, arreryd agayne hym dedely

warre. By meane wherof Bassianus was slayne, when he hadde ruled this land by moste concordaunce vi. yeres.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXIII. CHAPITER.
                     CArassius a Briton of vnknowen byrth was of the Brytōs made ruler, in the yere of our lord .ii. hundred and .xviii. the whych as before is touched, was by the senate of Rome deputed for a substytute or a ruler vnder the Romaynes, as yt is shewed in theyr cronycles, in the absence, or whyle Bassianus then emperour of Rome and kynge of Brytayne, was occupyed aboute the nedes of the empyre. This Carassius for that he was not of power to withstande the Pictes / or for the fauoure that he bare towarde thē for aydyng hym agayne the Romayns: he gaue to them the countre of Albania, that now is called Scotlande.
                     But ye shall vnderstande, yt here is not ment all Scotlande. For as wytnessyth Policronica / this parte yt was gyuē thus to the Pictes, was the south parte of Albania, and beganne at Twede, and enduryd to the Scottysh see. Of the kynde of those Pictes is somwhat shewed before in the story of Marius / but more after shall be shewed of them in conueniēt place, bothe of theyr ofsprynge and maners.
                     Then yt foloweth in the story, whē the Romaynes hadde knolege of the deth of Bassianus / anon they sent a duke frō Rome named Alectus with iii. legyons of knyghtes, for to slee Carassius, and to subdue the Brytons to the empyre. To the whyche Alectus fortune was so fauourable, that he chased Carassius, and lastely slew hym / when he hadde ruled the Brytons by most accorde of wryters viii. yeres.
                     But Iacobus Philippꝰ authour of a boke named Supplementū cronicarum sayth, that in the tyme that Maximianus or Maxymyan surnamed Herculeus, and Dioclecyan Dalmatheus were emperoures of Rome: they harde that this Carassiꝰ had taken vpon hym to were ye purpure that onely was reserued to emperours / &amp; also yt he ruled the realm of Brytayne as to his synguler vse / and furthermore were credybly enfourmed, that Narsetꝰ an other substytute hadde or occupyed the eest lā
                        des wyth cruell batayll / and other prynces the great coūtre of Affrica / and many other also by the instygacyon and leuyng of one named Achilleus hadde subdued the countre of Grece. For whych sayde nouellys &amp; tydynges / these two emperours, to the ende to refourme all these sayde rebellyons, chase vnto them two noble men / of the whyche that one was named Galerius, and that other Cō
                        stancius, as cesars or felowes to rule the empyre. And yt done / the sayd .ii. cesars were sent with great powers, that one īto Affrica, and ye other into Egypte. This forenamed Maximyan came wyth great power of people into Britayne, and ouercame the sayde Carassius more by gyle then by strength / when the sayde Carassius had ruled the Brytons, as sayth the forenamed authour Iacobꝰ Philippus, by the terme of .x. yeres.
                     In the whyche sayeng appereth errour, for dyuersytie of tyme and yeres. For after moste accorde of wryters / and also by the affyrmacyon of the sayde Iacobus Philippus, the sayde emperoures Dioclesian &amp; Maxymyan, ruled the empyre of Rome aboute the yere of Crystes incarnacyon two hundred and .lxxxx. And this Carassiꝰ was ruler in Britayne long before, as in the tyme of Bassianus

emperour of Rome, ye reygned aboute the yere of our lorde two hundred &amp; .xiii. as testyfyeth Polycrocon and other.
                     Also a boke in frenche called la Mere de hystoryes, whyche maye be englyshed ye Moder of hystoryes, sayth that this Carassius was fyrste a treasourer or such a hygh offycer amōge the Romayns. By reason wherof he sought great abundaunce of ryches, and fyll by reason therof in fauoure of the senatours of Rome / so that fynally he was made senatour, and became a man of great authorytye / in so myche that Bassianus then emperoure made hym protector of the cytye and countre of Alexandrye. But then he was supprysyd wyth suche pryde, that he exercysed tyranny and other vnlefull meanes, in so excedynge maner that the countre waxed wery of him, and conspired his deth. wherfore after punyshemēt done vpon some of his enymyes / he feryng the sequell and reuengement of the same: left that countre and retourned vnto Rome / where after he had a season restyd, he was by the senate of Rome assygned for his sternesse vnto the rule of Brytayne, wyth the ayde of .iii. legyōs of knyghtes. And so beynge garnyshed wyth all abyly mentes of warre, entred this yle of Brytayne / and wyth great trauayle subdued them to the empyre / and so contynued the lyues tyme of the emperour Bassianus.
                     But so sone as he was assertayned that ye emperour was slayne at Edessa, as before in the story of Bassianꝰ is shewed / thynkynge that amonge the Romaynes shuld growe stryfe &amp; dyssencyon for the electyon of a new emperour / by reason of whych stryfe he myght the rather lyue so farre frō them wythout any correctyon: confederyd wyth the Scottes and certayne other of the Britons / and slew many of the Romaynes, suche of thē as he thought wolde not consent to his treason / and by that meane fynally was made kynge of Brytayne. And so contynued, as affermeth the sayde authour to accompte from his fyrst hauyng rule vnder the Romaynes, vnto the tyme yt he was slayne of Alectus .viii. yeres, not wythout exercysynge of his olde accustomed tyrannyes and other vnsyttynge condycyons.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXIIII. CHAPITER.
                     ALectus a duke or consull of Rome, sent as before is sayd from the senate / begāne to rule the Brytons, in the yere of our lorde .ii. hundred &amp; .xxvi. This in the englysh cronycle is named Allec. whych whē he had restoryd the lande to the subieccyon of Rome / he thē pursued certayne of the Brytōs, that had fauoured Carassiꝰ agayne the Romayns. And in that doynge vsed and exercysyd many tyrannyes and exaccyons / by reason wherof he fyll in greate grudge of ye Brytons. wherfore they entendynge to oppresse and subdue the power of the Romaynes / purchasyd and excyted a noble man of ye Britons called Asclepiodotus and duke of Cornewayle. The whyche gatheryd a great hoste of the Brytons, and made warre vppon the Romaynes, and chasyd them from coūtre to coū
                        tre, &amp; from towne to towne / and lastly Alectus wyth his Romayns drew hym to London, and there kept hym for his most suertye. wherof beynge warned Asclepiodotus: he with his Brytons came nere vnto the sayde cytye / where by meanes of prouocacyon on eyther partye vsed, lastely ye Romaynes issued oute of the cytye &amp; gaue batayll to the Brytons. In the

which fyght many fyll on eyther partye / but ye more on the party of ye Romaynes / amonge the whyche was also slayne Alectꝰ. wherfore a captayn of the Romaynes called Liuius Gallus, aduertysynge this myschyef, &amp; the great daūger that the Romayns were in: drewe backe into the cytye with the Romaynes that were lefte on lyue, and defendyd yt wyth theyr powers.
                     Thus then appereth, that Alectus was slayne of the Brytons / whyche was by most accorde of writers whē he had ruled this lande vnder ye Romaynes by the terme of .vi. yere.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXV. CHAPITER.
                     ASclepiodotus duke of Cornewayle, as sayth Gaufryde (but after the sayeng of Eutropius and Beda, he was presydente of the Pretory of Rome) began his domynyon ouer the Brytons, in the yere of our lorde two hundred and .xxxii. The whych as before is sayde, wyth his Brytons gyrt the cytye of London wyth a stronge syege / and kepte the forsayde Liuius Gallus and his Romayns in streyte holde / &amp; finally, as affermyth myne authour Gaufride, with knyghtly force &amp; violēce entred the sayde cytye, and slewe ye forenamyd Liuius Gallus nere vnto a broke there at that daye rynnynge, and hym threwe into the sayd broke. By reason wherof long after yt was called Gallus or wallus broke. And at this day ye strete where some tyme ranne the sayde broke, is nowe called walbroke. And after he hadde thus venquyshed the Romayns: he helde this lande a certayn of tyme in peasyble wyse, and ruled the Brytōs wyth good iustyce / in rewardynge &amp; exaltynge the good men, and punysshynge of the euyll.
                     In this whyle by styrynge of dysclaunderous &amp; dyuylyshe persons / a grudge was arreryd attwene the kynge and a duke of his land called Coill or Coillus, the whyche was duke or erle of Kaercolym or Colchester / wherof the cause is not apparaunt. But how it was, great people were assembled on both parties / and fynally mette in the feld, where was faughtē a great and stronge batayll. In the whyche Asclepiodotus was slayne / when he had reygned to the concordaunce of other histories, and after the affermaunce of the olde cronycle by the space of .xxx. yeres.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXVI. CHAPITER.
                     COelus erle of Colchester began hys domynyon ouer the Brytons, in the yere of the incarnacyon of Cryste .ii. hoūdred .lxii. This in the englyshe boke is called Coyll / the whiche guyded the lande to the pleasure of the Brytons a certayne tyme. But as wytnesseth Gaufryde, when the senate of Rome had vnder standynge of the deth of Asclepiodotus, they were ioyous of the deth of hym, for so myche as he hadde euer ben an enemye to ye empyre. But for so mych as at that dayes was great dyssencyon amonge them selfe, as wytnesseth ye cronycle of Rome: they coude not conuenyently sende any armye of knyghtes for to warre vppon this Coelus. wherfore he contynued ye longer in reste &amp; good peas. After the cronycle regestred within the monastery of saynt Alboon / the sayd holy martyr suffered his passyō in the yere of our lorde .ii. houndred lxxx. &amp; .vi / whych shulde be the .xxiiii. yere of this present kynge. But thys dyscordeth from suche wryters, as affermen the holy man to be martyred in the .x. persecucyon vnder Dioclesian and Maximian emperours.
                     Neuerthelesse at length was sente

from ye senate a noble wyse man called Constancius / the whiche as affermeth the forenamed auctour, had before tyme subdued to the empyre a great part of the coūtre of Spayne. But that sayenge dysagreeth to the wrytynge of Eutropius. For the coū
                        tre of Spayne was not subdued by hym tyll after yt he was emperour.
                     Than it foloweth, whan this Constancius was arryued in Brytayne with his army / anone Coelus assembled his Brytons. But for he dredyd the strength and fame of thys Constācius, he sent to hym an enbassad, affyrmynge vnto hym cōdycyons of peace, wyth graunte of paymentes of the trybute, whych before was denyed / or ellys as meaneth Polycroni
                           •
                        a, wythin a moneth after the landynge of this Constancius, Coelus was dede. wherfore the Brytons to haue the more peace / wyllyd this knyghte to take to wyfe Heleyn the doughter of Coelus, wyth the possessyon of the lande of Britayne / which by hym was graunted. Then as before is sayde, Coelus dyed, when he had ruled the Brytons after most accorde of wryters .xxvii. yeres.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXVII. CHAPITER.
                     COnstancius a senatoure of Rome, as sayth Policronica / beganne to rule the Brytons in the yere of oure lorde two hundred .lxxx. and .ix. This as before is shewed maryed Heleyn the doughter of Coelus last kyng of Brytayne. But ye shall vnderstande, that this Constancius was fyrste maryed vnto Theodora the stepdoughter of Herculeus Maximianꝰ / and had by her syx sonnes. So that this Heleyn was his secōde wyfe, whyche was fayrest of all maydens, and therewyth lerned, and suffycyenly lettred. She is also noted of many writers to be a captyue or a prysoner to the Romaynes.
                     Of this Constantius lytell memorye is lefte in the bretyshe or englishe cronycles / excepte that he receyued of the foresayde Heleyn a sonne named Constantinus / the whyche after for his knyghtly &amp; marcyall dedys, was called Constantyne the great.
                     But for the noble dedys of so vyctoryous a duke shuld not be hydde, as was this Cōstantius: therfore I shall now folowe the story of Rome, whych sayth, that for so myche as in the tyme of Dioclesianus and Maximianus beynge emperours, many coūtres rebellyd agayne the empyre: therfore the sayde emperoures admyttyd this Constantius, and one Galerius as cesars, whych was a dignyte next of authoryte to the emperours. And so ye empyre was at those dayes guyded by two emperours, &amp; by two cesars. This Constātius, as wytnessyth Policronica made subiecte to the empyre the Almaynes, &amp; slewe of theym in one daye .lx. thousande. And after other many vyctoryous dedys, when the sayde .ii. emperours had of theyr free wylles resygned and gyuen ouer all imperiall dygnyte: thys sayde Constantius with his forenamed felowe Galeriꝰ, were made emperours / yt is to wytte Galerius was emperour of all Iliricum, whyche now is named Grecia or Grece wyth all the eest lādes, and Cōstantiꝰ hadde to hym all the west landes. But he helde hym contente wyth Gallia or Fraunce, &amp; Spayne with Britayn / &amp; graunted Italia vnto Galerius afore sayd. Then he subdued the countre of Spayne, as before is touched in the storye of Coelus, and a parte of Gallia / and after soiourned and abode in this lande of Brytayne in guydynge &amp; rulynge the same wyth great sobernesse, and ordeyned his sonne gotten vpon Helayne

to rule Gallia and Spayne.
                     But for to make this story more apparant &amp; open to ye readers, and also to ye herers: it is here to be noted, that Dioclesianus or Dioclesian beganne his empyre ouer the Romaynes after moste wryters, in the yere of our lorde two hundred .lxxx. and .vii. and he was emperour .xx. yeres. And this Cōstantius was sent into Brytayne from the senate as before is sayde, in the seconde yere of ye sayde Dioclesian, or the yere of oure lorde two hundred .lxxx. and .ix.
                     whyche Constancius after he had in due maner spedde the nedes of the empyre, as in subduynge this land of Brytayne, as before is sayde: he retourned agayn to Rome / where he was shortely after made cesar, and so contynued his lyfe, as before ys touchyd.

                        adde a pryuate lyfe: this sayde Constancius wyth his felowe Galerius, departyd the empyre betwene them, as before is touched / so that he reygned as ruler of Brytayn by the terme of .xvii. yeres and more or he were emperoure. And after as emperour of the weste partye of the empyre▪ and kynge of Brytayn .xii. yeres and more. And so in all ye sayd Cōstantius reygned ouer Brytayne xxx. yeres.

                           ••
                         Antonini / that this Cōstantine was made emperour, or beganne to rule the empyre, in the yere of our lordes incarnacyon .iii. hundred and .ix. which sayeng also affermeth Uyncēt historyall and other authours / wherof the cause is yt the sayde authours accōpt not the yeres of the reygne of Constancius, but folow the accōpte of Galerius felowe of Constancius / whych reygned as emperour but .iii. yeres. After the which rule yt muste nedis folowe, that this Constantyne began his empyre, as the sayd Antoninus wytnessyth / and folowynge ye other accompt yt shulde varye.
                     Then to pursue or contynue ye storye of this Constantyne / yt foloweth yt at the tyme of the decease of Constancius his fader, he was occupyed in warres in Gallia &amp; those ꝑties. After whose deth he by a certayn terme ruled Brytayne, &amp; the other landes, the whyche his fader before helde in due maner. And all be yt yt at ye daye he was a mysereant &amp; pagan: yet he vsed no tyrannyes, nor compelled not the Brytons to refuse the lawe, and to worshyppe idollys, as other

tyrauntes at those dayes vsed. In this whyle that Constantyne ruled thus the weste parte of this empyre / one Maxentius whych was the son of Herculeus Maximianꝰ, somtyme felowe in the empyre with Dioclesian as before is shewed / was of the knyghtes of the pretory declared emperour. This Maxentius was there worste of all men. And as testyfyeth Eusebius &amp; other / he fyrst began mekely, to wynne therby loue &amp; fauour. But when he was stablysshed in authorite / he exercysed all tyrāny, &amp; pursued all crystyens wyth all kynde of torment. Also he expulsed and putte out from Rome &amp; all honour hys fader Herculeꝰ Maximianꝰ, yt entēdyd agayne to haue ben emperour. Of ye tyranny of this Maxētius when Cō
                        stantyne had wyttyng: he assembled a great hoste of Brytons and Gallis, for to oppresse the malyce of the sayde Maxentius.
                     And for to rule and guyde this lād of Brytane in his absence, he deputed and ordeyned a mā of myght called Octauius / the whych Polycronica nameth duke of Iewessis, that after were named west Saxons. And when the sayde Constantyne had all peparyd for his voyage: he betoke the lande of Brytayne vnto the sayd Octauius, and after spedde hym vppon his iourney. And as he was towarde his sayde iourney, he sawe in his slepe the sygne of the crosse shynynge in the fyrmament, as yt hadde ben a brennyng lyght of fyre / and an aungell standynge therby and sayenge: Constantyne toicanata / which is to meane, Constantyne by this token thou shalte wynne vyctorye. when he awoke, he called this vysyon to mynde, and tolde vnto his secretes / by whose counsayll he commaunded the sygne of the crosse to be peynted and set in his baners and penons, and all his knyghtes.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXIX. CHAPITER.
                     WHen Constantyne had thus ordeyned the sygne of the crosse: he spedde hym forth towarde ye sayd tyrante Maxentius / and mette with hym at a brydge called Ponte Miluium. where after lōge fyght, he chasyd the sayd Maxentius / &amp; him with a great parte of his hoste drowned in the water of the sayde brydge, when he had reygned as emperour vpō .v. yeres. After which victory thus had: the sayde Constantyne wente vnto Rome / where he was receyued of ye senate wyth moste triumphe. And there caused the signe of the crosse to be peynted in the ryght hādes of the images, whyche the senatours of old tyme had areryd in worshyp of theyr vyctoryes. And vnder the feet of the images / he causyd to be wryten: This is the signe and token of the lyuynge god, that maye not be ouercomen.
                     Soone after this, Constātyne was conuertyd from his pagan lawe vnto Crystes fayth, by vertue of ye blessed Uernacle as some haue ben / or by the good doctryne of that blessyd pope saint Siluester first of y• name / the whyche was made pope in ye yere folowynge Crystes incarnacyon .iii. hundred and .xiii. Then Constantyne opened the prysons, and desstroyed the temples of false goddes, and dedycate them in the worshyppe of god and his sayntes. He also opened them that tofore were shytte and kepte close / and causyd dyuyne seruyce in them to be sayd, and gaue to the chyrche of Rome fyrste possessyons. And also he ordeyned that ye bysshoppe of Rome shulde be hedde of all byshoppes, &amp; all other to be obedyent vnto hym. He also bare claye

vppon his shoulders to the foundacyon of saynt Peters chyrch, as wytnessyth Policronica and other.
                     Of this fyrste indowement of the chyrch are dyuers thynges shewed, as reherseth Gwaldus Cambrens. saynt Hierom, and other / the whych I ouer passe for lengthynge of tyme of this worke.
                     And whyle that Constantyne was thus occupyed in Rome: hys moder Heleyne then beyng ferre from hym, and herynge that he was become a Crysten man: sent vnto hym letters of recommendacyon, that he had forsaken the worshyppynge of idollys. But she dyspreysed hym, in that that he worshypped a man that was nayled vppon a crosse. But after receyte of these letters / he wrote answere to his moder, that he shulde suffycyently proue, that he byleued and worshypped hym, that was fyrste creatour and maker of the worlde. And not onely a man but also god &amp; man, with diuers other poyntes touchyng the fayth, whych I ouerpasse.
                     For resonynge and profe of thys, was after assygned .vii. score iewes / and Siluester wyth a certayne nomber of crysten clerkes, to dyspute the artycles of Crystes fayth. where after dyuers myracles shewed, &amp; good profe made by holy scrypture: the sayde iewes were confounded / and the sayde Heleyne was conuerted vnto the fayth of Crystes chyrche / and traueyled soon after to Hierusalem, where she by her industrye and labour fande oute the holy crosse, with the .iii. nayles that oure lorde was nayled wyth to the same crosse. wherof she lefte there a parte / and the other dele was brought vnto Bizancium nowe called Constantyne noble. whyche cytye the sayde Constantyne greatly augmentyd wyth excellent buyldynge / and therin also caused to be arcryd a chyrch of meruaylous beautye, &amp; named yt Sophia. when the emperour hadde receyued the foresayde parte of the cros wyth the .iii. nayles: he after some authours put two of the sayde nayles in the brydell of his horse, whych he vsed in batayll. And the thyrde he caste or caused to be caste (as wytnessyth saynt Ambrose) in a swalowe of the see called mare Adriaticū. whych swalowe was before that tyme so peryllous, that vnnethes any shyppe escapyd that daunger / and garnysshed the crosse wyth many ryche stones freyt wyth golde / and after with great reuerēce conueyde it to Rome, as in dyuerse hystories is declaryd. Then this Cōstantyne remoued the emperyall see vnto his cytye of Constantyne the noble / and there for the more partye kepte his emperyall honoure, and other emperours in lyke wyse after hym. By reason wherof the emperours were longe after called emperours of Constantyne noble. This man was so myghty &amp; mercyall in his feates and all hys dedys / that for hys more honoure he had an addycyon putte to his name, and was called for his great myght and power, Constantyne the great. He was also the fyrste crysten emperoure / and dyd many notable actes for the weale of Crystes fayth. Amonge the whyche seuen are noted by the forenamed Antoninus, in the ix. tytle of ye second part of his worke before named: wherof the fyrste was that Cryste shulde be worshypped as god thorough the cyty of Rome.
                     The seconde was, that who so of Iesu Cryste spake any blasphemy, he shulde be greuously punyshed.
                     The thyrde was, what persone that dyd any iniurye or wronge to a

Crysten man / he shuld be depryuyd or put to ye losse of halfe his goodes. The fourth, that lyke as the emperour of Rome is hede of all tēporall prynces: so the byshoppe or pope of Rome is hed of all byshoppes. The fyfte, that what persone fledde to the chyrche for his sauegarde or suerty / that there he shuld be defended from all peryll and daunger. The syxte, that no man shuld presume to buyld any temple or chyrche wythin any cytye or towne, wythout the specyall lycence of his byshoppe. The seuenth, that euery prynce shulde gyue the .x. parte of his possessyons to the buyldyng and meynteynyng of chirches.
                     The whyche lawe he fyrste executed / and after wyth a pykax or mattoke with his owne hande, brake the groūde where as now standeth saint Peters chyrche. and .xii. cophyns or treys full of erth he bare away vpon his shulders / as wytnessyth the foresayde Antoninus and other.
                     But after those manyfolde good dedys / he fyll into the heresye called Ariannys heresy. By meane wherof he was so blynded, that he then became an enymye to Cristes chyrch, &amp; ꝑsecuted crystē men, &amp; exyled ye pope Siluester / or as some meane ye sayde Siluester fledde the cyte for fere.
                     For this as wytnessyth Iacobus Philippus and other wryters / this Constantyne was smyten wyth the euyll of lepry. For curynge wherof iii. thousand chyldren were brought to thēperours paleys to be slayne, yt he in the blood of them myght be bathed, and so clēsyd of his lepry. But when he saw the childern and the moders sorowyng for them, he was moued wyth pytye, and sayd: the dygnitye of thēpyre cometh of myldnesse. For yt is demyd, that he shuld dye ye sleeth a chyld in batayll. Then what crueltye were this to sle so many innocentes wylfully? yet better yt were to vs to dye and saue those chylders lyues / then to gette a cruell lyfe by ye deth of so many innocentes.
                     For this myldnesse it is redde that saynt Peter and Poule apperyd to hym the nyght folowynge, warnyng hym to sende agayne for Siluestre ye pope, and he shulde be by hym restoryd to perfytte helthe. whyche was done, and he heled as the legende of sayntes bereth wytnesse.
                     Thus haue I shewed to you a part of the dedys of Constantyne / whych yf I shulde cōtynue the hole processe of his reygne, that endured as emperoure by the space of .xxx. yeres: I shulde therof make a large volume. But it concernyth nothynge of thentent of this worke, as touchynge the lande of Brytayne: therfore I woll retourne my style to Octauius from whom I haue made a lōg digressyō.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXX. CHAPITER.
                     IN this passetyme whyle Constantyne occupyed hym in nedes of thempyre as aboue is shewed: Octauius beynge lieutenant in the lande of Brytayne vnder Constantyne, ruled the lande to the pleasure of the Brytons a certayne of tyme. But when he perceyued that he was in fauoure of them, and that Constantyne was farre from hym / castynge also in his mynde, that ye sayd Constantyne beyng then emperour, wold or myght not lyghtly retourne into Britayn: he therfore with helpe of his affynyte and frēdes, withstode the Romaynes lefte in Brytayne of Constantyne / and vsurpyd the rule &amp; domynyon of ye lande. wherof whē certayntie came to ye knowlege of Cō
                        stantyne: he in all hast sent into Brytayne a duke named Trahern̄, the whyche was vncle vnto Heleyne moder of Constantyne. when this Trahern̄ was arryued in Brytayne with

iii. legions of knyghtes: anon Octauius made towarde hym wyth hys Brytons / and wyth hym mette nere the citye, then called Kaerperis, now called Porte chestre or Porchestre / but more verely in a felde nere vnto the cytye of Kaerguent, that now ys called wynchester / whych felde then was named Maesurian. The .ii. hostes mette wyth great ire, and fough ten longe whyle. But in ye ende Trahern̄ was compelled to forsake the felde / and after drewe wyth his Romaynes towarde Albania or Scotlande. wherof Octauius beyng warned, folowed hym / and in the countre of westmerlande gaue vnto hym the seconde batayll, where then Octauius was chasyd &amp; Trahern̄ was vyctour / the whych pursued Octauius so egerly, that he cōpelled hym to forsake the lande of Britayne, and to sayle into the countre of Norway for his sauegarde.
                     But yt was not longe after, that the sayde Octauius gaderyd a newe people of Brytons &amp; Norways, and was redy to retourne agayn into Britayne. In whych tyme, as testyfyeth myne authour Gaufryde / an erle of Brytayne that entyerly loued Octauius, by treason slewe the sayd Trahern̄ a lytell before the landynge of the sayde Octauius. whyche shortly subdued the Romaynes and ye lande to his owne vse. This shuld be after moste concordaunce of wryters, whē Constantyne wyth also the ayde of Trahern̄, hadde ruled this lande of Brytayne by the terme of .x. yeres.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXXI. CHAPITER.
                     OCtauiꝰ duke of ye Iessis, otherwyse westsaxons / beganne his reygne ouer the Brytons, in the yere of our lorde .iii. hundred .xxix. This in the englyshe boke is called Octauian / the whych as testyfyeth Gaufryde, gaderyd in shorte whyle after so great plentye of treasoure and rychesse, that he feryd no man / and ruled this lande in peasyble wyse. So that of hym or of his actes is left lytell memorye / excepte that when he was fallen into age, by the counsayll of Brytons he sent vnto Rome for a noble yonge man of the aliy of Heleyne, moder vnto Constantyne called Maximianꝰ, as after more playnly shalbe shewed: all be yt that some aduysed hym to make one Conan Meryadok his cosyne, kynge after hym. But by the instāt labour of Caradok then duke of Cornewayll / Octauius lastly sent vnto Rome Mauryce the sonne of the forenamed Caradok / to brynge or conuey the sayd Maximianus into Brytayne, for to mary the onely doughter of Octauius / and by reason therof, to enioy ye realme of Brytayne. This Maximianꝰ is of some auctour named Maximius / the whych as wytnessyth Gaufride, was the sonne of Leonyne, brother to Heleyne, and vncle vnto Cō
                        stantyne the great. whych saynge affermeth also Iacobus Philippꝰ authour of a boke called Supplementum cronicarum / wherin he nameth the sayde Maximianus a knyght of the Bryton blood.
                     Then it foloweth, when the forenamed Maurice had spedde his nedes, so yt he came to the presence of Maximianꝰ, &amp; shewed theffecte of his Message: the sayd Maximianus to hym graunted, &amp; in all haste prepared for his voyage into Brytayne / &amp; shortly after with cōuenient cūpany landed at Southampton. wherof beynge warned Conan Meryadok: he wyth a certayne of knyghtes of his affinytye, was purposed to haue frayed with the sayd Maximianꝰ, &amp; to haue destressed hym / for so mych as he wel knewe, that by hym he shuld be pu
                           •
                         from the rule of the lande. But thys

purpose was let by the commaundement of the kynge or otherwyse, so yt the sayd Maximianus was cōueyed safely to the kynges presence, &amp; shortly after wyth consent of the more partye of his lordes, gaue his doughter vnto the sayde Maximianus wyth possessyon of this yle of Brytayne. The whyche mariage solemnysed &amp; endyd, the sayde Octauiꝰ dyed shortly after. But howe long he reygned, none of the foresayde authours testystye / excepte dyuers of them agre, yt he contynued his reygne tyll ye tyme that Gracyan and Ualentinyan ruled the empyre / the whyche beganne to reygne the yere of our lorde .iii. hū
                        dred .lxxx. and .ii. By whyche reason yt muste folowe, that the sayd Octauius reygned at the leest .liiii. yeres.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXXII. CHAPITER.
                     MAximianꝰ or Maximiꝰ ye son of Leonine &amp; cosyn Germayn of Constantyne the great / was made kynge of Bryton, in the yere of oure lorde .iii. hundred .lxxx. and .ii. Thys in the englyshe boke is named Maximian / the whych as testyfyeth Gaufryde and other, was stalworth and myghty of his handes.
                     But for he was cruell and pursued somdele the cristen: he therfore of all wryters is called Maximianꝰ the tyrant. Attwene this &amp; Conan before named, was stryfe and debate / and dyuers conflyctes attwene thē was foughten, in the whyche eyther of them spedde dyuersly / all be yt that lastely they were made frendes. So that Maximianꝰ reygned a season in quyete, and gaderyd rychesse, &amp; treasour not all wyth out grudge. Lastely he was moued &amp; exyted to warre vpon the Galles / thorow whych coū
                        cell he wyth a great hoste of Brytōs sayled into Armorica that now is called lytell Brytayne / and bare hym so knyghtly, that he subdued that countre vnto his lordshyp / &amp; after gaue the sayde countre to Conan Meryadok, to hold of hym and of the kyngeꝭ of great Brytayn for euer. And then commaunded the sayde lande to be called lytell Brytayne.
                     For this vyctory his knyghtes proclamed hym emperour. where thorough he beynge the more exaltyd in pryde / passed farther in the landes of the emprye, &amp; vyctoryously subdued a great parte of Gallia or Fraunce, and all Germania. For thys dede / dyuers authours accompt hym false and periuryd. wherfore yt shulde seme that before his departynge frō Rome, he was sworne vnto Gracian and Ualentynyane emperours, that he shuld neuer after clayme any part of the empyre. And also for the brekynge of this othe / he was after chalengyd or blamed of saynt Martyne byshop of Turon. To whom he answered that he was compelled of his knyghtes to take vppon hym as emperour / or ellys he shuld of thē haue ben slayne. Neuerthelesse the sayde byshoppe shewed vnto hym, that for his vntrouth he shuld not longe prospere or reygne.
                     After that worde was brought vnto the emperours, that Maximianꝰ had wyth harde bataylles thus subdued Gallia and Germania: Gracianꝰ wyth a great hoste came down to resyste hym. But when he harde of ye marciall dedes of Maximianꝰ / he was a drade and fled backe to the citye of Lugdun or Lyōs in Fraūce. where after the sayde Gracianꝰ was slayne / and his brother Ualentinian was compelled to flee to Constantyne the noble. Then Maximianꝰ to haue the more strength to wythstāde his enimyes: made his sonne named Uictour felowe of the emperour. In

this whyle that Maximianꝰ warred thus in Italy: Conan Meryadoke, to whom as before is sayde Maximianꝰ had gyuen the land of lytell Brytayne / for so mych as he &amp; his knyghtes had no wyll to mary the doughters of Frenschmen, but rather to haue wyues of theyr owne blood: therfore this Conan sent messagers vnto Dionotus then duke of Cornewayll, and chyfe ruler of Brytayne / wyllynge hym to sende his doughter Ursula wyth a certayne nomber of virgyns, to be coupled to hym &amp; to his knightes in maryage. The which soone after prepared accordyng ye request of Conan, the foresayd Ursula accōpanyed wyth .xi. thousande vyrgyns, and were sent by her sayde father towarde lytell Brytayne / as witnesseth the englyshe cronycle, Gaufryde, and also Policronica.
                     But yt shuld appere by the sayeng of Antoninus, Iacobꝰ Philippus, and other writers / that this Ursula with her company shulde not be sent forth of mych Brytayne, nor maryed aboute this tyme / but in the tyme of Marcianus beynge emperoure / the whyche began his empyre after most accorde of wryters, in the yere of our lord .iiii. hundred &amp; .li. Of the martyrdome of these maydens dyuers authours wryte dyuersly. wherfore I remytte them that wyll haue farther vnderstādyng in this mater, vnto ye legende of saynts redde yerely in the chyrche, where they maye be suffycyenly taught and enformed.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXXIII. CHAPITER.
                     ANd as before is shewed Maximianꝰ beynge occupyed in warres in Italy: two dukes named Gwanus, and Melga / the whych as Gaufryde testyfyeth and other, were sent from Gracian and Ualentinian emperours, to punyshe and subdue the Brytons that fauoured the party of Maximianꝰ / warred sore vpon the costes of great Brytayne, and occupyed a great parte of Albania. wherof when Maximianꝰ had knowlege / he sente into great Brytayne a knyght and captayn named Gracianus or Gracyan. The whyche wyth two legyons of knyghtes bare hym so knyghtly / that in shorte processe he chasyd the sayd .ii. dukes into Irlande / &amp; helde the lande of Brytayne in good peace to the behalfe of Maximianus.
                     In this whyle Maximianꝰ contynuyng his warre agayn the empyre / &amp; entendynge to be emperour: Theodocius named the elder then emperour of the eest parte of the world, herynge of the deth of Gracyan, &amp; chasynge of Ualentynyan, wyth a great power spedde hym towarde the sayd Maximianꝰ. And shortely after at a citye in Italy named Aquilia / toke the sayde Maximianꝰ, and hym behedded. when knowlege of the deth of Maximianꝰ was comen to Gracyan, that then had the rule of mych Brytayn: he seasyd the land &amp; made hym selfe by strength kynge of Brytayne / whē or after that Maximianꝰ had gouerned the same, by most accorde of wryters by the space of .viii. yeres.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXXIIII. CHAPITER.
                     GRacianus the whych of Gaufryde is called Municeps, yt maye be taken for an hyred or waged knyght, or for ye keper of gyftes, or berynge the chyef rule of a cytye: beganne to rule the Brytons, in the yere of oure lorde .iii. hundred .lxxx. &amp; x. The whych exercysyd all tyranny and exaccyon vppon his subiectes / for the which he was had in wonder full hatered amonge the Brytons / 

and amonge them cast and sought many wayes and meanes for hys destruccyon / but he by dyuers meanes escapyd theyr daungers, and punysshed greuously all suche fautours. wherfore lastly as sayth Gaufryde they fyll vpon hym of an hole assent and kylled hym / when he had reygned or more verely vsurped by the terme of .iiii. yeres.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXXV. CHAPITER.
                     AFter that Gracian was thus slayne of the Brytons / the forsayd Gwanus and Melga knowynge the Brytons to be wythout hed or ruler: assembled also people and retourned into mych Brytayne / wastynge and brennynge on euery syde, and destroyed greate plenty of Brytons, as wytnessyth Gaufryde and other.
                     But Policronica sayth that whan the Romayns knewe of the deth of Gracyan / they sent a knyght called Constantyne to haue the rule of Brytayne and other countrees there about. But he was after demed an enemye to the empyre, for harme and s
                           •
                        athes by hym done in Fraunce. wherfore by commaundement of Honorius then emperour / a knyght or erle called Constancius was sente agayne the forenamed Constantine / and slewe hym at a place or towne called Arelet. After thys the Brytōs were agayne vexed by the Pictes &amp; other straunge nacyons. By reason wherof they were cōstrained to sende agayne to Rome: requyrynge them of ayde, vppon condycyon that they shuld alway be subiecte vnto Rome. The whyche request and promesse thus herde of the senate: Honorius aforenamed was sent into Britayne wyth a legyon of knyghtes / whyche is .vi. thousande .vi. houndred .lxvi. The which legyon with helpe of the Brytons / chasyd ye foresayde Pictes and other enemyes / and taughte the Brytōs to make a walle ouerthwart the lande from see to see / that ys to meane from the water of Humber to the Scottyshe see, and ordeyned thē wardeynes and kepars of the wall / and after retourned to Rome. Thys wall as testyfyeth Policronica, was made of turuys / and strechyd from Pemilton̄ or Penulton̄, vnto ye citye of Acliut or Acliud. But for thys wall was of small strength: the enemyes before named dystroyed certayne partyes of this sayd wall, and ouerrode the countre, and toke grete prayes dayly, &amp; dyd as myche harme as they had done before tyme. wherfore the Brytons were constrayned to seke for newe socour to the Romayns. Then dyd Foloaynes sende an other legion / the whyche agayne chased the sayd Pictes and other enemyes / and made than a wall of stone of the thycknesse of .viii. fote, and in heyght .xii. fote, in the selfe place where before Seuerus had made a dyke and wall of turfes. And yt done the Romaynes comforted and exorted the Brytons to be manly and corageous to wythstande theyr enemyes / shewyng to them forther that they shuld truste to theyr owne strengthe, for so myche as the Romayns beynge so ferre from thē, myght not lyghtly come from so ferre wyth an armye of knyghtes / &amp; also not wythout great coste and trauayle. After whyche monycyon and exortacyon thus gyuen to the Brytons, by the mouth of the archebysshop of London, wyth other instruccyons apperteynynge to the feytes of warre: the sayde Romaynes toke leue of ye Brytons, as though they shulde after ye tyme no more retourne īto Britayne
                     But it was not longe after that the Romayns were thus departyd / that

the Pictes and Scottes beganne to breke out of theyr dēnes and caues. These two nacyons after some authours, shulde seme to be one. But by the declaracion of Ranulphe in his .lviii. chapyter of his fyrste boke, they shulde appere to be two maner of peoples / or at the last dwellyd in twoo sondry countres. As the Pictes in the northsyde of Scotlād, or after Beda in ye southsyde, whiche conteyneth Galeway and Lodeway. And the Scottes by ledyng of theyr duke Renda shulde possede Irland: all be yt after an arme of the northe parte of the see passynge by Deyra, shuld departe the Pictes. But in the tyme that ye Saxōs ruled the lande / ye Scottes by maner of treason slew the mighty men and rulers of the Pictes / and so after kepte that countre for theyr owne. These two nacyons dyscorde in maners, but not in clothynge &amp; in fayth, and in couetyse of the shedynge of mannes blood, they be one.
                     Then as before is sayde, these Pictes and Scottes entred the lande, and brake ye walle before made, and slewe the wardeyns therof / and after spoyled and robbed the coūtres, and chased so cruelly the commons and other, that they were comfortlesse. By meane wherof the Britons were brought in suche daunger and myserye / that eyther of them robbed and slewe other. And ouer this ye groūde was vntylled and vnsowen / wherof ensued great scarcytye and hunger: and after hunger ensued deth.
                     Thus after one mychyef came an other / as deth vpon deth, and sorow vpon sorow, whych fyll vpō them by stryfe medlyd wyth the great hūger. The whych mysery in this wyse cōtynuynge the chyef of them toke aduyse amonge them selfe / and fynally concludyd that for remedye of this myschyef, they wolde sende vnto Aecius then beynge kynge in Fraunce. whyche Aecius was mayster of the chyualry of Honoriꝰ then emperour, and occupyed in warres in a parte of Gallia. To this Aecius was sent writyng, wherof theffecte was this. To thy manhode Aecius be it vnderstanden the mysery of the Brytons / the whyche straunge nacyons chase vnto the see / and the see dryueth vs agayne to straunge nacyons. Of the which ensew two maner of carayns / ye one by violēce of ye enemyes swerd, and that other by wilfull drownyng. But all theyr wrytynge was but in vayne / so that from the sayd Aecius, nor yet from the Romaynes, hadde they no refuge nor comfort. In this whyle the hunger encreased / and the people were so ouerset with theyr enymyes, that many of thē were as yolden &amp; toke partye agayne theyr own neyghbours. And ye other that were of more power, and dwelled farther wythin the lande / defendyd them in theyr beste maner. Lastely the noble and wysest of them / and specyally ye archbyshop of London wyth other of the lande, kepte a counsayll at Lō
                        don. By the whyche yt was concludyd yt an embassade shulde be made vnto the kynge of lytell Brytayne, to impetre and aske of hym ayde and comforte in theyr great necessyte. Of whyche ambassade the sayde archebyshop was appoynted for the chyef and pryncypall / the whych is named of Gaufryde Guethelinus / and of ye englyshe cronycle Gosseleyne. which sayde byshoppe wyth the other vnto hym assygned, so spedde them, that in shorte and conuenyent tyme they came vnto the presence of Aldroenꝰ then kynge of lytell Brytayn / and to hym declaryd the effecte of theyr message. The whyche hauynge compassyon of the lamentable request made

vnto hym by the sayde ambassade / after aduyse taken of hys lordes, he graūted vnto the bysshop, vppon condycyon that yf god sent to them victory of theyr enemyes, that they shulde crowne hys brother kynge of great Brytayne / the whyche he entendyd to sende thyder wyth a conuenyent armye. whyche condycyon the sayde bysshoppe wyth the other gladly acceptyd &amp; fermely graūted.
                     So that thus it is apparant vnto you, that this lande was longe without hedde or gouernoure / whyche length of tyme is of some authours determyned to be longe, and of some but shorte / so that lytell certentye is therof lefte.
                     wherfore I haue shewed and dryuen certayne reasons after myne opynyon and dull mynde, in the table before expressed / wherin it shall appere vnder correccyon, that the sayd season and tyme of this land beynge without kynge, to rekyn from the laste yere of Gracian vnto the fyrste yere of Constantyne no we next ensuynge, was fully .xxxix. yere.
                     
                        FINIT TRIBVYVM.
                        YE shall also forthermore vnderstande, that here endeth fynally ye trybute and domynyon of the Romaynes. For after thys daye they had no trybute to them payed / nor no Romayn prynce after this dayes ruled thys lande of Brytayne. The whyche trybute and domynyon endured from the .ix. yere of Cassybellan, vnto the tyme of Seuerus by the terme of two houndred and .lv. yeres. And from the tyme of Seuerus vnto the fyrste yere of Gracyan a houndred .lxxx. and .iii. yeres. And from the fyrst yere of Gracyan vnto the laste yere of thys mysery .xliii. yeres. So that from the yere that Iulius Cesar made fyrste thys Ile of Brytayne trybutary vnto the empyre / vnto the last yere or ende of thys foresayd misery, flowyd .iiii. houndred .xxxi. yeres. But Polycronyca sayth that the Romaynes ruled and had trybute of this lande about .iiii. houndred .lxx. yeres. whyche sayeng is full lyke to be true, yf the ende of theyr dominyon be determyned at ye laste departyng of the Romayns out of thys lande.
                        ANd thus here an ende of the iiii. parte of thys worke / for so myche as the fornamed Gracianꝰ was the laste of Romayne kynges yt reygned in myche Brytayne / or that no trybute was after this day payed vnto the Romaynes.
                        wherfore in gyuynge thankes to that moste blessyd vyrgyne our lady saynte Mary, for the good exployte and spede had to thys tyme, and to opteyne her moste habundaūt grace for the perfourmaunce of the reste or other dele of the same: I here with all humblenesse salute her wyth the iiii. ioye of the forenamed vii. ioyes, the which begynneth,

                              Gaude nexu voluntatis. &amp;c.
                              O excellent pryncesse and quene celestyall / 
                              Be ioyous and glad, for thou eternally
                              By knot of charyte, and dygnyte pryncypall
                              Art to the hyghest ioyned celestyally
                              That thou may impetre, what is necessary
                              For thy seruauntes, thou virgyn moste pure
                              Of thy swetteste Ihesu, and optayne it sure.
                           
                        
                        Thys .iiii. parte to be accompted from ye fyrste yere of Seuerus, vnto the last ende or yere of thys misery: includeth of yeres .CC. and .xxvi.
                     
                  
                  Thus endeth the fourth parte.
               
               
                  
                  THE FYFT PARTE.
                  
                     THE .LXXVI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        HEre accordynge to the promyse made by me in ye begynnynge of thys worke: I shall brynge in &amp; shewe vnto you the begynnynge of the reygne of ye kinges of Fraūce / and set them in suche a direct order, that it shalbe apparant to the reder, that it shalbe certaynly knowē what kyng reygned in Fraūce whan such a kyng reygned in Englande. And also I shall somdele touche the actes and dedys of the sayde kynges of Fraunce / so yt the cronycles of bothe realmes shall in this worke appere, and the names of the prynces which at ones reygned in Englande and in Fraunce.
                     Then for the perfourmaūce of the same, fyrste is to be noted, that after the subuercyon of Troye by the Grekes (as in ye begynnyng of this work is shewyd) dyuers Troyans beyng vnder the rule of nobles of the same lygnage, as Helenus sonne of Pryamus, Eneas, Anthenorus, &amp; other / serchyd ye worlde &amp; landyd in dyuers coūtrees. As Helenꝰ in Grece or Grecia / Eneas in Italia or Italy / &amp; so of other amōg. The whych nobles one named Turchus, &amp; an other named Franco cosyn Germayns / as Turchus the sonne of Troylus, &amp; Frāco or Francio the sonne of Ector / which sayd two cosyns serchyng theyr aduenture: after many &amp; dyuers daungers &amp; ieopardyes passyd by the see, lastly landed in a coūtre called Tracea or Tracia in Grece. And there wyth theyr cōpany enhabyted them nere vnto a ryuer called Dion. And after they hadde contynued there a season of tyme: Turchus departed wyth a certayne of Troyans frō hys sayd cosyn Francio / and sayled after into a countre called Faso the lesse. where he wyth hys people dwelled longe tyme. whyche Faso shulde be in the countre of Sithia. Of thys Turchus dyscendyd as sayth ye Frē
                        che cronycle .iiii. maner of people. That is to saye, Austrogothis, Ipogothis, wandalis, and Normans. And Frācio or Frāco remoued after wyth hys company into a countree named Pannoma / whyche countree now shuld seme to be a parte of Hungery or ioynynge nere to it. There nere vnto a ryuer called Thanais they buylded them a cytye, and named it Sicambria / by reason wherof they were longe after called Sicambri. They were also named Franci, as sayth the Frenche cronycle, after thys man Francio. Turpinus that wrote the gestes of the greate Charles / sayth that whan Charles hadde made the countre of Spayne subiecte, and was retourned into Fraunce: he made all the bonde mē dwellynge aboute or nere vnto Paris or in all Gallia fre, in the wourshyppe of saynte Denis and of saynt Iamys of Galis / vppon condycyon that they shulde yerely offre foure pence to thys worke of saynt Denis churche. By reason wherof they were named Franci, as men freed that to fore were bond. Policronica saith they were named Franci of Ualentynyan the emperour, as it were for fyersnes. But how so euer they came by that name they were called Franci as Frenschemen.
                     This sayd peple were also named long tyme Galli / &amp; were trybutaries to Rome &amp; vnder theyr rule, tyll the

tyme of Ualentinyan emperour, aboute the yere of Cryste .iii. hoūdreth &amp; .lxvi. Thys Ualentinyan hauynge the rule of the west parte of ye world made warre vppon a people called Aleynys, that dwelled nere vnto the forenamed Gallis. These Aleynys were egre of fyghte / and ouer yt they were so closyd wyth fennys &amp; marrys, that the Romaynes myghte not wynne to them by force / wherof they often rebellyd agayne the empyre. wherfore in the ende Ualentinyan consyderynge the fyersnes of ye Gallis, wyth theyr nere dwellynge vnto the sayd Aleynys / couenaūted with them yf they wolde subdue the sayde people, they shulde haue releace of .x. yeres trybute. whyche couenaūt well and suffycyently confermed to the Gallis / they in shorte whyle after by theyr knyghthode and polycy, subdued or vtterly chased the sayd Aleynys. For the whyche dede they contynued the foresayde .x. yeres wythout payenge of any trybute. whyche .x. yeres ronne and expyred / ye Romaynes agayn claymed the former accustomed trybute. To whom it was answered, yt they had redemed the sayd tribute with the price of theyr blood, and ought not any more to be charged with any suche trybute.
                     wyth whych answere the Romaynes beynge sore dyscontentyd / made newe warre vpon ye sayd Sicābris. Of whyche warre the Sicambris or Gallis had the worse, and were chasyd from theyr citye of Sicambria. Then as wytnessyth Polycronica &amp; other, they drewe nere vnto the water of Ryne / and grewe in shorte processe to suche a multytude &amp; of suche strength, that they in shorte whyle after by ledynge of theyr .iii. dukes named Marcomirus, Somomꝰ or Symon, and Genebaur / warred vppon the landes of the empyre, &amp; such as were subiecte vnto ye same. wherof Theodosius surnamed the yonger then emperour beynge warned: he anone sente .ii. of his dukes wyth a greate hoste for to subdue the sayde Gallis or Sicambris. But they defendyd them so knyghtly, yt the sayde dukes were chasyd / and as wytnessyth mayster Robert Gagwyne, a greate nomber of the Romaynes were slayne.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXXVII. CHAPITER.
                     AFter this victory thus opteyned by the Sicambris: they waxed so stronge that they wan from the Almaynes dyuers townes and stronge holdes wythin Germania. And after that they opteyned the famous cytye named Treueris / which as wytnessyth the aucthour of Cronica cronicarum, was fyrst foundyd in the tyme of the patryarche Abraham, before the incarnacyō of Cryst a thousande .ix. houndred .lxv. yeres. And so dayly wan vpon the nacyōs adioynynge to them, tyll they came to the ryuer of Seyn / where they restyd them, and buylded the countre all there about. In so mych that they than named them selfe Franci / as men freed and out of all daunger of the empyre of Rome / and theyr land after them they named Fraunce, whyche syns that tyme is greatly encreasyd. So that at this daye it is a countre of great welth &amp; honoure, and conteyneth many prouynces &amp; lordshyppes / as after the affyrmaūs of Policronica is touchyd in ye .xxvii. chapyter of hys fyrste boke / where it is shewed that Gallia which now is Fraunce, had that name Gallia of whytenesse of people. Thys Gallia or Fraunce hath in the North syde, Germania / in the Eest, the ryuer of Ryne / in the Southest, the Alpis or the hyghe mountaynes / and in the

west, the see Occean, whyche is called both Brytannicum and Gallicū, whyche is to meane, Englyshe see &amp; Frenche see. For yt departyth Englande and Fraunce, in the south see of myddell eerth, yt wassheth about by the the prouynce of Narbon. In the tyme of Iulius Cesar, Gallia was departed in thre / but for diuers happes that befell after in that land / the countre and land that stretcheth from the Ryne to Seyn̄, is now called Gallia Belgica, whyche is very Fraunce. And that countre that stretcheth from Seyn̄ to ye ryuer of Leyr, is called Gallia Lugdunensis / wherof the ouer parte hyght or is named Burgundia that is Burgoyne, and the nether parte is Nestria or Normandye.
                     And the countre that stretcheth frō the ryuer of Leyr to the ryuer of Geround, is called Gallia Aquitania / whych is Guyan, and stretcheth out of the eest from the riuer of Roon̄, vnto the west Occean. wherof the ouer parte therof hyght Celtica, whyche is to meane Heuenly, because that hyghe mountaynes be therin.
                     From the water of Gerounde to the see of middell eerth, and to the Moū
                        taynes called mōtes Pireni or great hylles of Spayne / is clepyd Gallia Narbonensis. And now a parte therof is called Gothia, and some Uasconia, whyche is to meane Gascoyne.
                     And so Gallia is closyd aboute wyth thre noble waters / wyth the ryuer of Ryne in the north syde / wyth the ryuer of Roone in the eest / and wyth the Brytyshe occean in ye weste. In Gallia or Fraunce ben many noble cytyes, wherof Parys is hed and pryncypall / whyche in the fyrst foundacyon was clepyd Parydes, after Parides a Troyane, that departed from Troy wyth Eneas and other, as wytnessyth Carinus and other wryters of histories. But the frenche cronycle sayth it was fyrst foūded by ye Sycambris, and named by them Lutecia, before the incarnacyon of Cryste .iii. hundred .lxxx. and .xv. yeres. And in the whyle that the forenamed Marcomyrus was as there chyefe hedde and gouernour: for the more beauty of the name / and also in mynde of Paris sonne of Pryame kynge of Troye, of the whych he was lynyally descendyd, he therfore chaunged the name, and commaunded yt to be called Paris.
                     In Gallia also be these prouynces and lordshyppes folowynge / Braban, Flaundres, Normandye, Pycardye, Brytayn the lesse, Poytowe, Gascoyne, Guyan, Tolowse, Burgoyne, Angeo, and Mayne, Prouynce, Champayne, and Aluerne. All whyche sygnouries and lordeshippes belonged or apperteyned vnto the crowne of Fraunce / all be yt that dyuers of theym hath ben gyuen oute by maryage or otherwyse. So that the kynge of Fraunce claymeth to be chyef lorde of theym, and at this daye hath the possessyon of them / excepte Burgoyne, Flaundres Braban, and Normandye / for the whyche he is trybutarye vnto the kynge of Englande.
                     Then yt folowyth, when the sayde Gallis or Frenchmen hadde thus cō
                        quered these foresayde countres, or the more parte of theym, or at lesse made theym vnto the sayde Gallis trybutary: then the forenamed Marcomyrus as theyr chyef hedde or gouernour, closyd cytyes wyth stronge walles, and buylded stronge holdes and castelles / and after dyed, leuyng after hym a sonne garnyshed wyth all knyghtly vertue, named Pharamundus or Pharamonde.
                  
                  
                     
                     Francio. THE .LXXVIII. CHAPITER.
                     PHaramundꝰ the son of Marcomyrus beforenamed / was after the deth of his said fader, made or ordeyned the fyrst kyng of Frenchmen, by the agrement of hystoryes / &amp; also as affermeth mayster Robert Gagwyne and other, in the yere of our lordes incarnacion foure hūdred and .xx. And of the worlde, or after ye creacyon of the fyrste Adam folowynge the accompte of thys worke, as before is shewed, fyue thousande vi. hundred and .xix. After Brute beganne his domynyon in thys yle of Brytayne, a thousande, fyue hūdred and .lvi. And the yere of mysery of the Brytons .xxvi.
                     Of this Pharamundus is lytell thynge lefte in memory / excepte that myne authoure Gagwyne testyfyfyeth, that he made certayne lawes whyche longe tyme enduryd after. But for the names of the lawes and vse of them be derke to englyshe vnderstandynge: therfore I ouerpasse theym, and folowe the story / whych affermeth, that when the sayde Pharamonde hadde ruled the Frenchmē well and nobly by the space of .xi. yeres, he dyed / and lefte after hym a sonne named Clodio Crinitus or Capellatus.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXXIX. CHAPITER.
                     CLodio ye son of Pharamonde was made kyng of Fraunce, in the yere of our lorde .iiii. hūdred &amp; xxxi. And the .xxxvii. yere of the foresayd mysery of Brytons. The which as before is sayd was surnamed Crinitus and Capellatꝰ / by reason wherof the kynges of Frenchmen longe tyme after, were called Criniti. This to augment hys lordshyppe, made warre vpon a people called Turynges / and by great &amp; sore fyght made them at lēgth subiecte to hym / which countre as sayth the frēche cronycle, is a parte of Almayne. And at thys daye or tyme of this Clodio his reygne / the Romaynes had no more of the land of Gallia or Fraūce in theyr rule, then that whyche lyeth from ye ryuer of Leyr vnto ye ryuer of Ryne, whyche is called Gallia Lugdunensis. And when he hadde thus subdued the Turynges / he then sent his espyes ouer the Ryne to se what strength they were of, that inhabyted that countre. And after reporte to hym brought of the sayde espyes, that the countre was fertyll and ryche, and the people therof but of small defence: he with his army ouer spred the countre / and after shortely beseged the cytyes of Cambrey, and Turney and them wanne. But in ye cytye of Turney was a certayn nomber of Romaynes / whyche manfully defendyd the towne longe tyme. And when they ꝑceyued that they myght no lenger holde the towne / they then manfully issued out, and gaue to the Frenchmen harde batayll. But fortune was to theym frowarde / so that they were dystressyd. After whyche countres and townes thus goten by Clodio, wyth other vyctoryous dedes by hym done: he lastely dyed, when he had ruled the frēchmen .xix. yeres wythout issue of his body.

                        COnstantinus the brother of Aldroenus kynge of lytell Brytayn, was crowned kyng of myche Brytayne, in the yere of oure lorde foure hundred and .xxxiii / and the thyrde yere of Clodio then kynge of Fraunce. The whyche guyded the lande with suche manhode and polyce, that he kepte yt from daunger of enymyes / and for tyme of hys lyfe helde yt in god quyete &amp; reste. Of thys Cōstantyne is lytell mynde made or lefte in wrytynge / excepte that he receyuyd of his wyfe thre sonnes / the whyche he named Constante, Aurely, or Cō
                        stantius, Aurelius, Ambrosius, and Uter, whyche was surnamed Pendragon.
                     But for he sawe and perceyuyd, that his eldest sonne named Constāt was dull and insolent of wytte: he therfore made hym a monke in the monasterye of saynte Amphyabyll of wynchester / whyche monasterye at this daye is called saynte Suythynes abbey. And to the other two bretherne he betoke vnto Guethelinus archbyshoppe, to noryshe and brynge forth.
                     In the courte of this Cōstantyne, as witnesseth Gaufryde, was a Pict that was myche loued and greatly fauouryd of Constantyne / so that he myghte at all tymes come to the kynges presence.

                     THE .LXXXI. CHAPITER.
                     COnstantius sonne of Constantyne, by meane of Uortigernus was made kynge of Brytayne, in the yere of our lorde foure hundred and .xliii. This as before is touched, for so myche as his fader thought he was not very apt to take so great a charge as to gouerne the lande after hym, became a relygious man in the monastery before named. Or as some wryters meane, the sayd Constante of pure deuocyon that he hadde to god and saynt Amphiabyl, made hym selfe a monke vnwyttynge the kynge his fader and other his frendes.
                     But how or in what maner so euer he became a monke / trouth it is that Uortigerus or Uortigernus after ye deth of Constantyne, founde suche meanes that he was taken out of the abbey, and crowned kynge of Brytayne. By meane wherof the sayde Uortiger had all the rule of the land so that Constante hadde but onely the name. This Uortyger then consyderynge the innocencye and myldenes of the kyng / cast in his mynde how he myght be kynge hym selfe. And amonge other meanes / founde

to haue aboute ye kynges persone an hundred Pictes, or after some Scottes / ye whych he ordeyned for a garde for the kynges persone. which done / he bare hym in such wyse agayne the Pictes by meanes of great gyftes &amp; otherwyse, that they at length had Uortyger in such fauoure, that they feryd not to saye openly that Uortyger was more worthy to be kyng thē Constant. In this whyle Uortyger gatte into his possessyon the kynges treasour / and what was of hym cō
                        maunded was done, though other therat murmured and grudge. And euer in ryght and wronge he fauoured the foresayd Pictes or Scottes. The whyche at length perceyuynge his corrupte mynde, when they sawe that they had conuenyent tyme, fyll vpon the kynge, and hym slewe or murderyd.
                     After whych cruell dede by theym done / they presentyd the hed of Constante vnto Uortiger, then beyng at London. wherof when he was ware / to the ende that the Brytons shulde thynke that dede to be done agayne his mynde and wyll: wepte &amp; made semblaunt of all sorowe and heuenes / and causyd the sayde hundred knyghtes to be taken in all haste after, and theym by dome and lawe of ye lād to be be heddyd / by reason wherof he was taken not culpable, or innocent of the kynges deth. when the kynges deth was knowen to suche persones as hadde the kepyng of the two yonger bretherne, Aurelius and Uter: they in all haste for the more sauegarde of them, fledde into lytell Brytayne / &amp; there kept theym tyll yt pleasyd god ortherwyse to purueye for theym. And thus as ye haue herd was kynge Constante slayne / when he hadde reygned after moste wryters fyue yere.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXXXII. CHAPITER.
                     UOrtigernus duke of ye Iuesses, or Uortigerꝰ erle of Iewesses, after called westsaxons / was made kynge of Brytayne, in the yere of our lorde .iiii. hundred and .xlviii. and the .xviii. yere of Clodio kyng of Fraūce / whych after ye deth of Constant by strength and otherwise was made kynge, and ruled the land not all wythout trouble. For yt was not longe or the Pictes, whych hauyng knowlege of the deth and iudgemēt of theyr knightes and kynsmen, that they inuaded the north partes of the lande, doynge therin great harme and domage. And ouer that many &amp; dyuerse of the great of the Brytons, perceyuyng that the kyng Constant was not murderyd all wythout consent of the sayde Uortyger: rebelled agayne hym / and dayly sent and say led ouer into lytell Brytayne, to the ayde and assystence of the foresayde chyldern of Constant / whyche putte the sayde Uortiger to great vnrestfulnesse / and the more for that, that he wyst not nor knewe not in whom he myght putte his truste and confydence in.
                     wyth these perturbaūces was medled plenty of corne &amp; frute, yt the lyke therof had not ben sene many yeres passyd. wherwyth was ioyned lechery &amp; pestylence, with many other incōueniences / so ye vice was accōpted for small or none offence. The which reygned not onely in the temporalty, but also in the spiritualtie &amp; hedes of the same. So ye euery mā turned the poynt of his spere agaynst the trewe &amp; innocent man / &amp; the cōmons gaue them all to dronkēnes and ydelnes / where thorough ensued fyghtynge, stryfe, and mych enuy. Of which foresayd myschyues ensued mych mortalyte and deth of men, that the lyuyng

scantly suffysed in some countres to bury the dede. And ouer this ye kyng was so hard beset with ye forenamed enymyes / that he was cōstrayned, as affermyth Policronica, to sende for paynems, as the Saxōs, to helpe to withstand his enemyes and defende his lande / and also he dayly ferid the landyng of Aurely and Uther.
                     Uortyger thus beynge beset wyth many aduersytyes in vysytynge hys lande / and then beynge for dyuerse causes hym mouyng at Dorobernia or Caunterbury: tydynges came to hym of the arryuynge of thre longe shyppes full of armed men at the yle of Tenet. wherof fyrst he made countenaunce as though he hadde ben in doute whether it had ben the two brethern of Constant or none. But whē the same was blowen aboute, yt they were none enymyes: anon he caused the leders of them to be brought vnto his presence / freynynge of theym the cause of theyr landyng &amp; of theyr nacyon and countre. The whych answered vnto the kynge and sayd they were of the coūtre of Germany / and put out of theyr countre by a maner sorte or lot at sōdry tymes vsed with in the sayde lande / the whyche was vsed for so myche as the people therin encreasyd so faste, that wythoute such prouysyon had, the coūtre shuld not suffyce for the people / the whych was suche as foloweth.
                     At sondry tymes when the sayd coū
                        tre was replenyshed of people: the prynces and rulers therof wolde assemble at a certayne place, and call before theym the lusty yonge folkes. Of the whych they wold chose out a certayne nomber / and appoynte to them certayne dukes or leders, with all thyng necessary to the warre. And them so garnyshed / wold cōmaunde to serche theyr aduēture, &amp; to wynne some lande by theyr knyghthode, where they myght inhabyte thēselfe. By whych vse &amp; custome thus longe vsyd / now was fallen to theyr lotte, to do as theyr fore faders had done before theym.
                     wherfore syns fortune had brought them to this land / they besought the kyng, that he wold take them to his seruyce, &amp; they wold be redy to fyght for ye defence of him and his countre. And when the kyng hadde enquyred farther: he foūde that they had two leders named Hengistꝰ and Horsus / and they and theyr people were called Saxons.
                     The kynge thus beyng asserteyned of the maner of these straūgers, and that they were of the gentyle of pagan law: sayde he was very heuy &amp; sory, that they were myscreantes. But he was ioyous &amp; glad of theyr commynge / for so myche as he had nede of suche sowdyours to defende hym and his lande agayne his enymyes. And so receyued them to hys wages and seruyce, as is wytnessed of Gaufryde and other mo wryters.
                  
                  
                     THE .LXXXIII. CHAPITER.
                     BEda the holy man sayth, that Uortyger sent for the Saxōs stronge men of armes, that hadde no lande to dwelle in. The whych came in thre longe shyppes called Obylas / and receyued a place of hym to dwell in, in the Eest syde of Brytayne called the yle of Tenet besyde Kent. Guillelmus de regibus a writer of hystoryes 
                           •
                        ayth, that the Saxons came oute of Germany by wyll to wynne worshyppe &amp; lande / and not by lotte or compulsyon.
                     And also that they worshypped at that dayes a god named woden, and a goddesse named Frya. In the worshyppe of the whyche god the

thyrde feryall daye in the weke they named wodnesd aye / whyche at this daye we call wednysdaye. And in worshyppe of the sayde goddes they called the fyfth daye friys daye / the whyche we call now frydaye.
                     Of these foresayde people came thre maner of people, or thre maner of names / that is to say Saxōs, Anglys, and Iewetes. Of the Saxons came the eest Saxons, westsaxons, &amp; the south Saxons. Of ye Anglys came the eest Anglys, the myddell Angl

                     And of the Iewetys come the Kentyshmen, &amp; men of the yle of weyght. Of the fyrst cōmyng of these Saxōs into great Britayn, authours in party varrey. wherfore in the table before named / it shall appere vnder correccyon, that the forenamed Hengistus and Horsus wyth theyr company fyrst landed in the foresayde yle of great Brytayne in the yere of our lorde .iiii. hundred and .l, &amp; the thyrd yere of Uortiger.
                     Then yt foloweth these Saxons wyth the kynges power bete downe the enymyes before sayde, and defendyd the land in most knyghtly wyse, so that the kyng hadde the Saxons in great loue and fauour. whyche fauour Hengistus wel apperceyuyng / vpon a season when he sawe conuenyent tyme, he axed of the kynge so myche grounde as the hyde of a bull or other beste wolde compare / which the kynge to hym graunted. After whyche graunt, the sayde Hengyste to the ende to winne a large groūde / causyd the sayd bestes skyn to be cut into a small and slender thonge. And with the same mette out a large and great circuyte of grounde / vpon the whyche he shortly after buylded and sette a large and stronge castell. By reason of whych thonge the sayd castell was lōg afternamed Thonge castell / whyche was sette by the agrement of all wryters in the countre of Lyndesey. After thyse tydynges sprange into Germania, of the plentye and fatnes of the lande of Brytayne, wyth other commodytyes perteynyng to the same. By meane wherof the Saxons dayely drewe to the sayde lande / and conuenaūted with the Brytons, that the Britons shuld entende theyr worldlynes and other necessaryes / and ye Saxons as theyr sowdiours, shulde defende the land from incursyon of all enymyes. For the whych the Brytons shulde gyue to them competent mete and wages.
                     Then by the sonde of Hengiste, came wyth .xvi. sayles Ronowen the doughter of the sayd Hengist / which was a mayden of excellēt beaute. After whose commyng / Hengiste vpon a daye besought the kyng yt he wold se his castell, whyche he had newely edyfyed. To whose request the kyng was agreable / &amp; at the day assygned came to ye sayd castell, where he was ioyously receyued. And there amōge other passetymes the sayde Ronowē wyth a cuppe of golde full of wyne presentyd the kynge, salutynge and sayeng wassayle. The kynge whych before that tyme had herd no lyke salutacyon, nor yet vnderstode what she ment / axed of her fader what she mente by that worde wassayle. To whom yt was answered by Hengistꝰ that yt was a salutacyon of good &amp; gladnesse / and that the kynge shuld

drynke after her, ioynynge there vnto this answere, drynke hayl
                           •
                         wherfore the kyng as he was enfourmed toke the cuppe of the maydens hand and drank / &amp; after beheld the wēche in suche maner, that he was wounded with the darte of the blynde god Cupide, that neuer after he coude wythdrawe his loue from ye wenche / but lastely by instygacyon of the deuyll, axed her in maryage of her fader. And by force therof, as wytnessyth Policronica, he put from hym his laufull wyfe / of the whyche he had before tyme receyued .iii. noble sonnes called Uortimerus, Ca
                           •
                        agrinus, and Pascentius. Then the kyng gaue vnto Hengistus the lord shyppe of Kent, though Garangonus then erle therof therat grudged wyth many of his Brytons.
                     For this and for that that ye kynge had maryed a woman of vncought beleue: well nere all the Brytons forsoke hym and his workes. Neuerthelesse some there were as well nobles &amp; other, that cōforted the kynge in his euyll doyng. By whych meane and other vnlefull dedys then dayly vsyd / the fayth of Cryste began sore to apalle. And ouer that an heresye called Arianes heresy, began then to sprynge in Brytayn. For the which, two holy byshoppes named Germanus and Lupus, as of Gaufryde is wytnessyd / came into Brytayne to refourme the kynge and all other yt erred from the waye of trouth.
                     Of this holy man saynt Germayn / Uincent historyall sayth, that vpon an euenynge, when the weder was passynge cold, and the snowe fyll very faste / he axed lodgyng of the kyng of Brytayne, for hym and his comperys / whych was denyed. Then he after syttyng vnder a bushe in the feld, the kynges herdmen passyd by / and seynge this byshop wyth his company sittyng in the weder / desyred hym to his house to take there such poore lodgynge as he had▪ wherof the bysshoppe beynge glad and fayne

And for hym and his company wysled his wyfe to kyll his onely calfe / and to dresse yt for his gestes souper, ye which was also done. when the holy man had souped, he called to hym his hostes, wyllynge and desyrynge her that she shulde dylygently gader to gyder all the bones of the deed calfe / and them so gaderyd, to wrappe to gyder wythin the skynne of the sayde calfe / &amp; then it lay in the stall before the racke nere vnto the dame. whych done accordyng to the commaundement of the holy man I shortly after the calfe was restoryd to lyfe, and forth wyth e

                     Uppon the morowe this holy bysshoppe toke wyth hym the herdman, &amp; yode vnto the presence of ye kynge / &amp; axed of hym in sharpe wyse, why that ouer nyght he hadde denyed to hym lodgynge. wherwyth the kyng was so abas
                           •
                        hed, that he hadde no power to gyue vnto the holy man answere. Then saynt Germayne sayde to hym: I charge the in the name of my lorde god, that thou and thyne departe from this paleys / and resygne yt &amp; the rule of thy lande to hym that is more worthy this rome then thou arte. The whyche all thyng by power diuyne was obserued &amp; done / and the sayde herdman by the holy byshoppes authoryte, was sette into ye same dygnyte. Of whom after descendyd all the kynges of Brytayne.
                  
                  
                     
                     THE .LXXXIIII. CHAPITER.
                     THys story is also confermed of Antoninꝰ archebysshoppe of Florence / and at lengthe by hym shewyd in the .xvii. chapyter and .ix. day of the seconde part of hys worke called Som̄ Antonini. But by whō so euer thys story was fyrste wryten: I thynke he was none that discended of the walshmen, nor yet of theyr blode. For they come all of Pryamys blode, and not of an herdman, excepte that they fetche theyr lyne from Dauyd the holy kynge &amp; prophete. Thys storye semeth to be of more fame then of credence. For other wryters tell thys story to be done in the region of Powys by Buly theyr kynge. And also for so mych as the foresayd authour maketh no mencyon of the more Brytayne nor of the lesse: it is doutefull whyther thys happe fyll in that one regyon or in that other. All be yt in the lyfe of saynte Germayne it ys redde, that the sayde saynte Germayne deposyd Uortiger &amp; enhaunced the herdman, as before is declared, as affermeth Polycronica. Then it foloweth in ye story, when saynte Germayne hadde restoryd some parte of Brytayne to the trewe fayth: he retourned into Fraunce, fro whens he was before comen. But in thys sayde sayenge shuld appere dyscorde in Cronycles. For as at this day was not the fayth of Cryste receyued in Fraunce, as after more clerely shall appere / wherfore no bysshoppe of Crystes fayth myghte then kepe any see in Fraunce. And also as affermeth Iacobus Phylyppus and other / holy Remigius was the fyrst yt tourned Fraūce to Crystes relygyon / and that, after moste concorde of wryters, to be in the yere of our lorde .iiii. hundred lxxx. and .xix. and the .xv. yere of the reygne of Clodoueus Lewys fyrste Crysten kyng of ye realme of Fraūce.
                     Then to furnysshe or perfourme the story of Uortiger, nedefull it is or necessary to retourne to the mater where we before lefte. And to shewe that for so moche as the Brytons wythdrewe them from Uortyger / he was therfore constrayned to holde wyth hym the Saxons. By whose counsayle he after sent for Octa the sonne of Hengyst / ye whych brought wyth hym an other company of Saxons.
                     when the lordes of Britayne sawe and consyderyd the greate multytude of Saxons, and theyr dayly repayre into thys lande: they assembled them togyder, and shewed to the kyng the inconuenience and ieopardy that myght ensue to hym and hys lande, by reason of the greate power of these straungers / and aduertysed hym in aduoydyng of greter daunger, to expelle and put them out of hys realme or the more parte of them.
                     But all was in vayne / for Uortyger bare suche a mynde to the Saxons, by reason of hys wyfe / that he preferred the loue of them before the loue of hys owne naturall kynnesmen and frendes. wherfore the Brytons of one wyll and mynde crowned for theyr kynge Uortimerus the eldest sonne of Uortyger, and depryued hym of all kyngly dygnyte / whē he hadde reygned after moste concorde of hystoryes .xvi. yeres.

In the whyche feldes or playnes he was encountred wyth the power of the Romaynes / in whose ayde was ye kyng of Fraunce Meroneus, the kynge or duke of Burgoyne, and other. where after a longe fyghte was slayne on bothe sydes the foresayde hundred and .lxxx. thousand. Of the whyche nomber the sayde kynge or duke of Burgoyne was one / as is more playnly shewed in the .xxxiii. chapiter in the .iiii. boke of the sayd Polycronicon, wyth other wonders whyche I ouerpasse.

                     THE .LXXXVI. CHAPITER.
                     CHyldericus or Hildericus the sonne of Meroneus / was ordeyned kyng of Fraunce, in the yere of oure lorde god .iiii. hundred &amp; .lx / &amp; the .xii. yere of Uortiger than kyng of Brytayne. The whiche ensued no thynge the warres of hys father / but allyed hym wyth all vyce and cruelnesse, in suche exterme wyse that he became odyble vnto hys subiectes. wherfore the said Childerich / perceyuyng the murmur &amp; grudge among the people / and ferynge hys sodayne distruccyon: coūsayled wyth a frend and lorde of hys named Guynomadus or Guynemeus / by whose counsayle in auoydynge greater paryll, he auoyded secretely hys lande, and yode vnto the kynge of Thurynges named Besygne, of whom he was ioyously receyued. But the at departynge of the kynge from ye sayd Guynemeus, he toke a pece of golde and brake it in two peces / wherof ye one pece he delyuered vnto the kynge, &amp; that other pece he kepte to hym self / sayenge to the kynge that whan so euer that he receyued from hym that pece of golde, that he shulde be sure to be restored agayne to hys regally and dygnyte.
                     After the kynge was departed his lande / the Frenshmen of one assent, chase for theyr gouernour and hed a Romayne named Gylf / whyche at that daye hadde a parte of Gallia or Fraunce in hys rule to the behofe of the Romaynes / whyche parte was named or nowe is named Soisons. whā thys Gilf was stablyssed in his authoryte / the forenamed Guynemeus behauyd hym in suche wyse towarde thys Gylf, that he had hym in specyall fauour aboue all the nobles of Fraunce / and wolde execute no thynge of charge wythout hys

and counsayll. wherof the sayd Guynemeus beynge ware / and remembrynge how he myght restore Chylderych to his former dygnyte, aduysed the sayde Gill to sette more greuous taskys vpon the Frenschmen / enfourmynge hym further, that yf any grudged there at, that he shuld punyshe some of the myghtyeste of them / by reason wherof he shulde fere the other.
                     whyche thus done accordynge to the forsayde counsayll / shortely after to brynge his purpose the better about, the sayde Guynemeus accused certayne rulers of Fraunce suche as he well knewe were great enymyes vnto Chylderych / the whych he caused to be taken and sent vnto Gill, &amp; Gill vpon them dyd sharpe execucyon. In the whyche he so perseuered, that the Frenschmen for remedy complayned theym to Guynemeus. To whom it was by hym answered, that he greatly meruayled of theyr vnstastablenesse that they hadde chosen to them a kynge, and now so sodaynly wolde haue hym deposed / shewynge furthermore that other they must cal agayn Childerich that exercysyd his lyfe in voluptuousnesse of lyuynge / or ellys they muste dwell vnder the kynge, whyche is cruell and full of blood shedynge, wyth dyuerse other exhortacyons cōcernynge the agayn callynge of Childerych to his fourmer dygnyte, whyche for length I omytte and passe ouer.
                     By meane of whyche exhortacyon, Childerich was secretly sent for / and receyued from his trustye frende the foresayde pece of golde / and spedde hym hastely into Fraunce. Agayne whom the foresayde Guynemeus in lykewyse sped hym / so that they met at a castell in the countre of Champion, where they wyth other to them allyed / gaderyd a great hoste, and made towarde the foresayde Gill or Gillion. The whych hauynge knowlege of the sayde conspyracye / ordeyned an armye of knyghtes, and yode agayne his enymyes. But he was ouerset and compelled for his sauegarde to fle into the countre of Soisons beforenamed, where he after endyd his naturall lyfe / &amp; Childerych was agayne restoryd &amp; made kynge.
                     Childerych then thus restoryd vnto his regally / subdued soone after a Saxon prynce named Onager / &amp; besegyd the cytye of Orleaunce, and yt receyued vnto his subieccyon and after passyd the ryuer of Leyr, &amp; subdued to his sygnory the countre of Angeo and Mayne.
                     when the fame of Childerich was brought vnto Basyna the wyfe of Besygne kyng of Turryngꝭ: she anon forsoke her owne lorde, and sped her into Fraunce, and so to the presence of Childerich, whom he receyued wyth all gladnes. And when he had of her frayned the cause of her commynge: she answeryd, for that that she knewe and vnderstode to be in hym more vertue and honour, thē in any other mā at ye day lyuyng / she was therefore comyn vnto hym to contynue the remanaunt of her lyfe in his cōpany / addyng also therunto that yf in any countre she knew his better, she wolde then serche see and lande to haue hym to her lord or husbande. But for she was assured, that he had no pere / she besought hym to accepte her in his company.

To the which he was agreable. where he so standynge, sawe fyrst a multitude of vnycornes, lyons, and lybardes, passyng foreby the paleys gate. And wythin a shorte space of tyme after, he sawe a great company of berys &amp; wolues rēnyng after the other. And thyrdly &amp; lastly he sawe a multytude of dogges &amp; other small rauenous bestes / the whyche in hys syghte fyll vppon the other .ii. companyes and vtterly deuoured them all.
                     when he hadde sene the fyne of his vision / not a lytell astonyed, he returned to hys wyfe / shewynge to her what he hadde sene. To whom she sayd / syr of me ye shal receyue a son / the whyche in all hys dedes shall be noble and honourable, lyke to ye vnycornes and lyons shewyd to you in ye fyrst vysyon. Of the whyche shall discende one other sonne, the whyche shall be rauenous and shall set hys mynde all to pyllage &amp; rauyne, lyke vnto the rauenous wolfe and here. And after hym shall come a chylde or chyldern that shall be of suche insolency and wastynge, that lyke as the rauenous hounde stroyeth and wastyth all that he maye tere wyth hys teeth / so shall these persons wast and destroye by theyr folyes all that other noble men hath purchased to theyr handes.

Then it foloweth whan thys Chylderych hadde ouercomen some baytayles in Almayne, and them subdued to hys empyre: he lastly dyed when he had reygned, wyth the .viii. yeres allowed to hys reygne for the tyme that he was exyled / and wyth the resydue that he reygned before &amp; after in all .xxiiii. yeres / leuyng after hym a sonne begotten vpon the forenamed Basina called Clodio or after moste wryters Clodoueus.

                     This batayle as wytnesseth Alfredus; was more wonne by vertue of the prayers of the holy byshop saynt Germayne, than by myght of ye Brytons. For when the holy man sawe ye Brytons gyue backe / he helde hys handes towarde heuen, and cryed thryse alleluya / whyche is to our vnderstādyng as mych to saye, as saue vs good lorde. Thorough whyche

                     The fourth batayll was nere vnto a moore called Cole moore. The whych was long and sore foughten by the Saxons / by reason that the sayde moore closyd a parte of theyr hoste so strongly, that the Brytons myght not winne vnto them for daūger of theyr shot / All be yt that fynally they were chasyd, and many of thē of cōstraynt drowned and swalowed in the sayde moore

                     UOrtigernus fader of Uortymerus last dede, was agayn restoryd to the kyngdome of myche Brytayne / in the yere of oure lordes incarnacyon foure hūdred .lxxi / and the .xi. yere of Childericus then kyng of Fraunce / the whyche all the tyme of the reygne of his sonne Uortimer, had restyd hym in the coūtre of Cambria or walys. where in this passe tyme after some writers, he buyldyd a strōge castel in a place called Generon̄ or Gwayneren, in the west syde of walys nere vnto the riuer of Gwana, in an hyll or vpon an hyll called Cloarcius. But the olde cronycle before spoken of, sayth y• this Uortiger was kept somwhat vnder rule of certayne tutours to hym assygned in ye towne of Caerlegion or Chester / and demeaned hym so well towarde hys sonne in aydynge of hym wyth hys counsayll and otherwyse, that the Brytons for it cast to hym such a fauoure, that they after the deth of Uortimer made hym agayne kynge.
                     It was not longe after that Uortiger was thus set in authoryte, but that Hengistꝰ percyd this land with a great multytude of Saxons. wherof herynge Uortyger / in all haste assembled his Brytons, and made towarde them. And when Hengistus hadde experyence of the great hoste of Brytons: he then ordeyned meanes of treaty and peas. where lastly yt was concluded that a certayne nō

And at ye day before appointed the kynge wyth a certayne of Brytons not ware of this purposed treason, came in peasyble wyse to ye place before assygned / where he fande redy Hengistus wyth hys Saxons. The whyche after due obeysaunce

made vnto the kynge / receyued hym with a coūtenaūce of all loue. where after a tyme of cōmunycacyon had / Hengiste beynge mynded to execute his former purposed treason, shewed his watche word. By reason wherof anon the Brytons were slayne as shepe amonge woluys, hauynge no maner of wepyn to defēde them self / excepte yt any of them myght by his manhode and strength get the knyfe of his enymye. Amonge the nomber of these Brytons was an Erle called Edoll or Edolf erle of Caerlegion or Chestre / ye whych seynge his felowes and frendes thus murdered, as affermeth myne authoure Gaufryde and other: he by his manhode wanne a stake in the hedge or ellys where / wyth the whyche he knyghtly sauyd his owne lyfe, and slewe of the Saxons .xvii, and fledde to the cytye or towne of Ambry nowe named Salysburye. After whyche treason thus executyd / the kynge remayned wyth Hengistus as prysoner.
                     Of the takynge of Uortyger, and sleynge of the lordes of Brytayne / an authoure called Guillelmus de regibus sayth, that Hengistꝰ agreed wyth Uortyger and hys Brytons / and that he shulde enioye the castell by hym before made, wyth a certayn of lande therunto adioynynge for hym and his Saxōs to dwell vpon. And when the sayde agrement was suerly stablyshed / this Hengiste entendynge treason / desyred the kynge wyth a certayn nomber of his lordes to come to hym to dyner wythin his sayde castell. The whych of ye kynge was graunted. And at the daye assygned the kyng with his lordes came to the sayde Thongcastell to dyner / where he wyth his was well and honourably receyued and also deyntely serued.
                     But when the kynge &amp; his lordes were in theyr moste myrth / this Hengiste had commaunded before, yt his owne knyghtes shuld falle at varyaūce among thē selfe. whych so done the remenaunt of his Saxons, as yt were in partynge of frayes, shulde fall vppon the Britons &amp; slee theym all, oute take onely the kynge. The whyche was done lyke as ye haue before harde deuysed / and the kynge was holden as prysoner.

                     HEngistus then hauynge the kynge as prysoner, &amp; a great parte of the rulers of Britayne thus as before is sayd subdued: was some deale exalted in pryde / and compellyd the kynge to gyue vnto hym, as wytnessyth Policronica, thre prouynces in the eest parte of Brytayne. whych thre prouynces shuld be Kēt, Southsaxon or Sussex, and Eestanglys, whych is to meane Norff. and Suff. as affermeth the authoure of the floure of hystoryes. But Guydo de columna sayth, that the foresayde thre prouynces was Kent, Eestsaxon or Essex, and Eestanglys / which is Norff. and Suff. Of the whyche sayde prouynces when Hengist was possessyd / he suffred the kynge to go at his lybertye. And then Hengiste beganne his lordshyppe ouer the prouynce of Kent, and sent other of his Saxōs to beweld the other two prouynces / that is to saye Eestanglys and Eestsaxons, tyll he hadde sente for other of his kynnesmen, yt he entē

                     THE .XCI. CHAPITER.
                     THus Hengistus beynge in the possessyon of this

prouynce of Kent: comaunded hys Saxons to call yt Hengistus lande / wherof as some authours meane the hole lande of Brytayn toke his fyrst name of Englande. But that sayeng shall appere cōtrary, as shalbe shewed hereafter in the storye of Egbert kynge of westsaxons. The whych after he had subdued ye more parte of the kyngedomes of Saxōs, &amp; made of all but one monarchye: he then cō
                        maundyd this lande to be called Anglia, &amp; his Saxons Anglys / whych after by corrupcyon of speche was called Englande, and the people Englyshemen.
                     This lordshyppe or kyngedome of Kent had his begynnyng vnder Hengiste, in the yere of oure lorde after moste concordaunce of wryters, and by reason of ye time .iiii. hūdred .lxxvi. And the fyfte yere of Uortygers last reygne.
                     But Denys and other, that accōpt this kyngdome to begynne in the yere of our lord foure hundred and .lv. allowe the begynnynge therof to be when Hengistus had fyrst gyft of the same, by reason that Uortyger maryed his doughter.
                     This lordeshyppe conteyned the countre that stretcheth from eest Occean vnto the ryuer of Thamys / and had vpon the southeest Southerye / and vppon the weste London / vpon the northeest the Thamys aforesayd and Eestsaxon nowe Essex. And this lordshyppe conteyned also the yle of Thanet.
                     whyche lordshyppe or kyngdome endured after moste wryters, from the tyme of the fyrste yere of the reygne of Hengiste, tyll the .xxv. yere of Egbert before named, by the terme of .iii. hundred and .xlii. yeres folowynge that accompte. At whyche season the sayde Egbert then kynge of westsaxons, subdued Baldredus thē kynge of Kent, and ioyned yt to hys owne kyngdome.
                     Al be yt that the authoure of Policronica affermeth yt to endure by the space of thre hundred and .lxviii, vnder .xv. kynges, wherof Baldredus was the laste: whyche folowyth nere vnto the accompt of Denys before named. The fyrste crysten kyng of this lordshippe was Ethelbertus, or Ethelbert / the whyche receyued the fayth of Cryste by that holy man saynt Austayne or Augustayne, nere about the yere of our lordes incarnacyon foure hundred .lxxx. and .xvi. The whyche Ethelbert caused soone after to be edyfyed the monastery of saynt Peter and Paule, in the eestsyde or ende of the cytye of Dorobernia now Caunterbury. He gaue vnto this Austayn and his successours byshoppes of Caunterbury, a place for the byshoppes see at Chrystes chyrche wythin the sayd cytye, &amp; endowed it with many ryche possessiōs.
                     This Hengiste and all the other Saxons whyche ruled the .xvii. pryncypates of Brytayne, as after shall be shewed, are called of moste wryters reguli / whyche is to meane in oure vulgare or speche as small or lytell kynges. So that this Hengist is accompted a lyttell kynge. The whyche when he hadde thus rule of the foresayde .iii. prouynces, he sent for mo Saxons / &amp; gatheryd them yt were sparkled abrode / so yt in these prouynces the fayth of Chryste was all quenchyd and in slepe.
                     Then Hengist wyth Octa his son gaderyd a great strēgth of Saxōs / and faught wyth the Brytons, and ouercame the Brytons, and chasyd them in suche wyse, that Hengiste kepte his lordesshyppe in peace and warre by the space of .xxiiii. yeres, as moste wryters testyfye.

                     NOwe then lette vs retourne agayne to Uortiger / ye which when he sawe the Saxons in suche wyse encrease theyr strength, and the Brytons dayly dyscreace / for as writeth myne authour Gaufryde, yt Saxons had the rule of London, yorke, Lincolne, or Lindecoln̄, and Kaerguēt, that is wynchester, wyth other good townes / wherfore as affermeth the sayd Gaufryde, the kyng for fere of ye Saxōs, &amp; also for that y• he was some deale warned of the commyng of the .ii. bretherne Aurely and Uter sonnes of Constantyne: he therfore consyderynge these many and great daungers, fledde into Cambria or walys, and there helde hym for the more suertye / where as wytnessyth the sayde Gaufryde he then buylded the castel before mynded. Of ye which buyldynge and impediment therof / and also of the gettynge or byrthe of Merlyne, and of his prophecyes he made a longe worke, the whyche I passe ouer for dyuerse consyderacyons, &amp; retourne agayne to Uortiger.
                     Trouth yt is, that whyle Uortygernus was thus besyed in walys / the forenamed brethern Aurely and Uter preparyd theyr nauy and men of armys, and passed the see, and landed at Totnesse as sayth the englysh cronycle. wherof when the Brytons were ware that were disparklyd and seueryd in many coūtres / they drewe to them in all hasty wyse. The which sayde bretherne when they sawe that they hadde a competent nomber of knyghtes / they made towarde walys to dystresse Uortyger.
                     wherof he beynge warned / for so myche as he well knewe, yt he myght not make sufficyēt defence by strēgth of knyghtes: he therfore garnyshed his castell wyth strength of men and vytayll / entendynge to sauegarde hym selfe by that meane / but all in vayne. For the sayde two bretherne wyth theyr armye, besegyd the sayd castell / and fynally after many assautes, wyth wylde fyre consumed the sayde castell wyth Uortiger, and all that was therin.
                     Of hym yt is redde, that he shulde lye by his owne doughter, in truste ye kynges shulde come of his blood. For the whyche dede he was accursyd of saynte Germayne / and lastely ended his lyfe as hefore is expressed, when he hadde reygned nowe laste ix. yeres.

                     AUrelius Ambrosius the seconde sonne of Cōstantyne, and brother to Constancius slayne by the treason of Uortyger / was kynge made of the Brytons in the yere of oar lorde .iiii. hundred .lxxx. &amp; one / and the .xxi. yere of Childericꝰ then kynge of Fraunce. Of thys yt is sayd, that when he hard of the dyuysion that was in the land of Brytayne betwene Uortiger and the Saxons / and in what maner the Saxōs had subdued the Brytons he in all goodly haste wyth ayde of the kynge of lytell Brytayne, spedde hym into thys lande. where after the aboue sayde vyctory hadde of Uortiger / he spedde hym towarde yorke, as affermeth Gaufride, and there chasyd the Saxons that helde the cytye wyth Octa or Osca sonne of Hengist / and toke the sayde Octa, &amp; kepte hym as a prysoner somwhat of tyme.

For of them was slayne foure dukes, and .iiii. thousande of other men, &amp; that other dele chasyd to theyr great daunger. yet this not wytstandynge Hengiste contynued his lordshyppe in Kent / and Aurelius Ambrose, whyche the englyshe cronycle nameth Aurilambrose, kepte the countre called Logiers or myddell Englande wyth walys / and chasyd the Saxons y• dwelled in ye .ii. forsayd prouynces of eest Saxon and eest Anglis, out of those countres.

                     THE .XCIIII. CHAPITER.
                     IN this passe tyme a Saxō named Ella, wyth his thre sonnes called Symen or Symon, Plettynger, and Cissa / came wyth thre shyppes called Obilas, and landed in the south parte of Brytayne, and slewe many Brytons at a place that then was named Cuneueshore / &amp; chased many vnto a wood thē called Andresleger / and after occupyed ye countre, &amp; inhabyted hym &amp; his Saxons wythin the sayde prouynce / makyng hym selfe kyng and lorde therof. By reason wherof by his might &amp; power the sayd prouynce or countre was after named ye kyngdome or lordshyp of Southsaxons. The whyche after most concorde of wryters shuld haue his begynnyng y• .xxxii. yere after the fyrst cōmyng of Hēgist. which folowynge ye accompte shuld be in the yere of our lorde .iiii. hundred .lxxxii / and in the seconde yere of Aurely then kynge of Brytayne.
                     This kyngdome or lordshippe had in the eestsyde Kent, in the south the see and the yle of wyght, in the west Hampsyre, and in the northe Southrey / and conteyned as wytnessyth Guydo Southampton, Somersetshyre, Deuenshyre / and Cornewayl. Of whyche sayde kyngdome Ethelbaldus or Ethelwaldꝰ was the .iiii. kynge, and the fyrste crysten kynge. Thys kyngdome endured shorteste season of all the other kyngdomes, and passyd soonest into the other. For yt endured not aboue an hundred and .xii. yeres, vnder .v. or .vii. kynges at moste.
                  
                  
                     THE .XCV. CHAPITER.
                     THen to returne where we left Aurely, whyche as before ye haue harde helde and occupyed the myddell parte of Brytayne wyth Cā
                        bria or walys, dyd hys dylygence to repayre ruynous places, as well temples as other / and caused ye seruyce of god to be sayde and done, whyche by meane of the Saxons was greatly decayde thorough all Brytayne. And after this Aureliꝰ beseged y• Saxons in ye hyll of Badon or Badowe, where he slewe many of theym. But dayly the Saxons encreasyd &amp; landed in myche Brytayn, as after shall appere. For shortely after a Saxon named Porth / landed wyth his two sōnes at an hauē in Southsex. After whome as some authours meane, ye hauē was after called Portismouth, whyche kepeth the name at this day. And in lykewyse they came to lande in dyuers places of Britayne / so that Aurelius had wyth them many conflyctys and bataylles, in the whych he spedde dyuersly / for he was somtyme vyctour, and some season ouer set. It is wrytē of hym in ye englyshe cronicle and other, that he by ye helpe of Merlyn shuld fetche the great stones now standynge vpon the playne of Salysburye, and called the stone henge, oute of Irlande, and caused theym to be sette there as they nowe

stande / in remembraunce of the Brytons that there were slayne and buryed in the tyme of the communycacyon had with Hengiste and his Saxons, as before in the storye of Uortiger is touchyd. But Polycronica alledgyth yt honour vnto Uter Pendragon his brother. In the tyme of this Aurelius, as wytnessyth also ye sayde Policronica / dyed Hengist in his bed, when he had reygned ouer ye Kentysh Saxons .xxiiii. yeres. After whose deth Octa or Osca his sonne, ruled ye sayd kyngdome other .xxiiii. yeres. All be yt that the brytyshe bokes, and also the cronycles of Enlande sheweth / that after that Aurelius had in batayll slayne Hengiste: he toke vnto his grace Octa his son, &amp; gaue vnto hym a dwellynge place in the countre of Galewey for hym &amp; his Saxōs then lefte on lyue. which semeth not to be true, for mater that shall after ensue / and also for y• that before is touchyd of the Pictes and Scottes, in the tyme of the myserye of the Brytons. Then yt foloweth, this Octa nother augmented nor mynyshed his lordshyp / but helde hym therwyth contented as his fader had to hym lefte yt.
                     Lastely &amp; in the ende of the reygne of Aurely, Pascentius the yongest son of Uortiger, whiche after ye deth of his fader was fledde into Irland for fere of Aurely, purchasyd ayde of Guilamour kyng of Irlāde. And wyth a great armye inuadyd thys lande of Brytayne by the countre of walys / in takynge the cytye of Menenia, and in wastynge the sayd coū
                        tre wyth iron and fyre. In the which season and tyme Aureliꝰ laye syke in his cytye of Kaerguent or wynchester. For whych cause he desyred hys brother Uter to gather an hoste of Britōs, &amp; to appease ye malice of Pascencius &amp; his adherētis. The whych accordyngly preparyd his hoste / &amp; at length ouercame the hoste of Pascē
                        cius, and slewe hym and the forenamed Guillamour in the same fyght.
                     In this whyle and season that Uter was thus gone agayne Pascentius / a Saxon or other straūger feynynge hym a Bryton, &amp; a connyng man in physyke, by the intycemet of Pascencius came vnto Aurely, where he lay syke / &amp; by his subtyle &amp; false meanes purchasyd such fauour wyth those yt were nyghe vnto the prynce, that he was put in truste to mynystre medycines vnto the kyng. This is named of writers Coppa or of some Eoppa.
                     The whyche when he had espyed his tyme cōuenyent to brynge about his false purpose / he gaue to Aureliꝰ a pocyon enpoysoned / by vyolence wherof he shortely after was dede, when he hadde reygned after moste wryters vppon .xix. yeres.

                     IN the tyme of ye reygne of this Aurelius as wytnesseth the authour of Policronica &amp; other / ye kyngdome of Eestanglis began vnder a Saxon named Uffa, about the yere of our lorde .iiii. hundred .lxxx. and xii, and the .xi. yere of Aurelius. The whych kyngdome conteyned Norlf. and Suff. nowe called. This hadde in this eest and north sydes, the see / in the northweste, Cambryge shyre / and in the weste, saynte Edmundes dytche, and Hertfordshyre / and in the southe Essex. This lordshyppe was called fyrste Uffynys lordshyp / and the kynges therof were named Uffynys, or after some authoures the people. But fynally they were named eest Anglys.
                     The fyrst cristen kyng of this pryncypate

was Redwaldus the thyrde kynge / but he was not so stedfaste as belonged to his relygyon. His sonne named Corpwaldus was more stedfaste / whyche after was slayne of a mysbyleuynge man, and for Crystes fayth as some wryte. But Guydo sayth that Sebertus was fyrste cristen kynge of this lordshyppe / &amp; that he made saynt Poulys chyrch of Lō
                        don. This vnder .xii. kynges endured, tyll the martyrdome of blessyd saynte Edmunde laste kynge therof / the whych was martyred nere about the yere of our lord .viii. hūdred and lxix. By the whyche reason yt shuld folowe, that this kyngdome shulde endure by the terme of .iii.C.lxxvii. yeres. And of this lordshyp, at that dayes was Elman or Thetforde the chyfe towne. But after Guydo, this lordeshyppe shulde begynne the yere of Grace .v. hundred &amp; .lxx / &amp; then shuld yt endure but .ii. hundred .iiii. score and .xix. yeres.
                  
                  
                     Francia. THE .XCVII. CHAPITER.
                     CLodoueus the sonne of Childericus or Hildericus before named, was after the deth of his fader ordeyned kynge of Fraunce, in ye yere of oure lorde .iiii. hundred .lxxx. and .iiii / and the thyrde yere of Aurelius then kyng of Brytayne. This of some wryters is named Clodoueꝰ Lowys. The whyche shortely after that he of this realme was authorysyd for kynge / heryng reporte of the beaute and grete vertue of Clotildis neuewe to Cundebald kynge or ruler of Burgoyne: sente vnto hym a knyght named Aurelius to treat a maryage betwene the kynge and Clotyld or Crotild. The which Cundebald more for fere then for loue assentyd.
                     The cause wherof as myn authour sayth was, for yt thys Crotyld was enherytour vnto the sayde lande of Burgoyne / and that she be reason of yt maryage shuld recouer her ryghte and put hym from the rule therof. This Crotild had before that day receyuyd the fayth of Cryste / and so cō
                        tynuynge her relygyon was maryed to Clodoueus then a paynym, and so endured a certayne of tyme. But yet she left not to enduce and tourne her lorde to the fayth in all that she myghte.
                     And after a certayn of tyme she was delyueryd of a sonne / the whyche by meanes of the holy man Remigius byshop of Raynes, and of the quene Crotyld, was crystyned and named Clodomerus / the whych dyed wyth in shorte processe after. For yt happe the kyng sayd that his goddes were dyscontented wyth hym, that he had suffred his chylde to be crystyned, &amp; for wrathe therof had taken frō hym his chylde. The quene takynge the kynges sayenge in pacyence / conceyued the seconde sonne, whyche also by the kynges agrement was also baptysed.
                     This also after a certayne of tyme was vexed wyth a greuous sekenes, in suche wyse that yt was lykely to haue dyed. wherfore the kynge was then more impacyent, and blamed ye relygyon of his wyfe in moste impacyent maner. The whych sayenges the quene toke pacyētly, and put all her confidence in god / to whom both she and Remigeus prayed so effectuously, that the chylde was restored vnto perfyte helth.
                     Thus Clodoueus perseuerynge in his erronyous lawe / made warre vppon the Almaynes. In whych warre beynge one daye occupyed in fyght agayne hys enymyes / he wyth hys people was put to the werse. wherof

whan Clodoueꝰ was ware / hauyng greate drede of hym selfe, called to mynde the often exortacyon of hys wyfe, and of the greate vertue of her goddes lawe / and sodaynly lyfte his eyen towarde heuen and sayde, god the whyche Clotylde my wyfe doth honoure, now helpe me. And yf this daye I may passe thys daunger and opteyne vyctory / I shall euer after worshyp the wyth true fayth. The whyche prayer skantly fynysshed the Frenchemen by dyuyne power were so vnyed and knyt togyther, and so knyghtly wythstode theyr enemyes / that in shorte whyle after they opteyned vyctory. whyche vyctory had / ye kynge with greate tryumphe retourned into Fraunce. wherof whan Clotylde was warned / she anone receyued hym wyth all ioye and gladnes, thankynge her lord god of his great vyctory / but more for that ye he had forsaken hys idolatrye, and was becomen seruaunt of ye onely god fourmer of all the worlde.
                  
                  
                     THE .XCVIII. CHAPITER.
                     IT was not longe after yt blessyd Remigius was sent for. The whyche enfourmed the kynge suffycyently in the fayth of Cryst / &amp; vppon an Eester daye folowynge, wyth great solempnyte baptysed the kynge. In tyme of which solempnysacyon doynge / the holy Crysine or oyle by neglygence of the mynysters or otherwyse, lackynge / a doue discendyng from heuen, brought in her becke or byll a vyoll fylled wyth oyle of moste swetest sauour / and delyuered it to saynt Remigius. The which was construed to be done by vertue of ye holy ghost. And wyth thys holy oyle whan the kyng was anoynted / the surplusage therof was kept with moste reuerence. I haue herde reported, that this oyle is kept at the cytye of Reynes or at Parys, and that yt neuer fayleth or wasteth / and that al ryghtfull enherytours of ye crowne of Fraunce be therwyth at theyr coronacyō anoynted. But &amp; it happen any myghty mā to vsurpe ye crowne by myghte / when the bysshoppe cometh for thys holy oyle, he fyndeth yt vyoll or glasse drye, and ellys not.
                     To thys reporte euery man maye gyue credence as hym lyketh / for I fande not this wryten in the gospell, nor yet in no boke of holy scrypture.
                     Then it foloweth after thys solēpnyte done / the kynge hadde certeyne wordes to the people, in exortynge them to leue theyr idolatrye, and to byleue in Cryste and hys fayth, by whose myghte and power onely he hadde venquysshed hys enemyes. By the whyche exortacyō and other meanes of the holy bysshop Remigius / myche people were some after conuertyd and baptysed.
                     Then the kyng buylded certeyne newe monasteryes / and dedycat the olde temples of idollys in honoure of Crystes sayntes. Among ye which one was nere vnto the cytye of Parys, in the honour of the apostles Peter and Paule. It is wytnessed of mayster Robert Gagwyne / that before these dayes all Frenche kynges vsed to bere in theyr armes .iii. todys But after thys Clodoueus had receyued Crystes relygyon .iii. floure de lyse were sente to hym by dyuyne power, sette in a shylde of asure / the whyche syns ye tyme hath ben borne of all Frenche kynges.
                     The sayd authour myndeth also that in a monastery of Fraunce called the monastery of saynte Bartylmewe / was somtyme kepte a clothe of redde sylke, whyche was named the aurysflambe, and borne for a baner in the felde agayne the Barbaris or hethen people / by vertue wherof

the frenche prynces wan many vyctoryes. But after whan thys precyous relyke or aurysflābe was borne agayne Crysten prynces / the vertue therof seasyd, and lastly was lost. But yet the lyke therof is kepte at saynt Denys / and had in greate reuerence of the bysshoppes and abbottes of the same place.
                     Then it foloweth in ye storye / whan Clodoueus hadde set hys realme in due order: Clotyld callyng to mynde the treason done to her fader, and also the wrongfull wythholdynge of her ryghtfull enherytaunce by her vncle Cundebalde / exorted her lorde Clodoueus to sende an embassade, &amp; to requyre restytucyon of her sayde ryght / yt whych was sone after done. And whan the kynge had receyued an answere, yt the sayd Cundebalde wolde not restore the sayd ryghte of hys wyfe: he in all goodly wyse prepared an armye, and made warre vppon the sayd Cundebalde. And after greate waste and dystruccyon of the coūtre: Clodoueus fynally besegyd hym in a cytye / &amp; after toke the sayd cytye by strength / and the sayd Cundebalde wythin ye same as prysoner. But by medyacyon of frendes and greate gyftes / wyth also a yerely trybute to be payed to Clodoueus, the sayd Cundebalde was releaced and sette at lybertye.
                  
                  
                     THE .XCIX. CHAPITER.
                     THis voyage thus spedde and orderyd: the kynge lefte behynde hym an armye of .v. thousand knyghtes, vnder the gydyng of Gū
                           defyll brother of the foresayd Cundebalde / and after retourned into Fraunce. But sone after the kynges departynge / Cundebalde cōtrary to the promyse before made, gaderyd a power of knyghtes, &amp; made warre vppon hys sayde brother / and lastly beseged hym in the cytye of Uienne / where vppon eyther parte was by skyrmysshes &amp; assautes great people slayne. All be yt in the ende Cundebalde wanne the cytye / and hys brother therein beynge, he afterwarde behedyd. About thys tyme great discencyon grewe atwene Clodoueus and the kynge of Gothys called Alericus. whyche varyaūce by agremēt of bothe partyes was put to the iugement of Theodorycus than kyng of Longobardes or of Italyās. The whyche after the sayde causes were well and suffycyently argued and debatyd before hym and hys coūsayle: he fynally gaue sentence yt a knyght of Clodoueus shulde stande vppon an hylle holdynge a spere vpryghte in hys hande / and that the kynge of Gothys shuld throwe or lay so mych syluer as shulde in processe couer the poynt of the sayd spere. whyche sentence as testyfyeth mayster Robert Gagwyne, the Gothis despysed sayenge that they had not suffycyent syluer wythin theyr land to perfourme the sayd sentence. And for despyte of the same / certeyne Gothys espyenge a prynce of Fraūce named Paterne, beynge assocyate wyth some dyuerse Frenshmen in a lofte or chamber / the whyche Paterne had ben solycytour for the Frenshe kynge in ye foresayd mater: the sayde Gothys by crafty and false meanes caused the floorth of the sayd chamber to falle / by whyche meane the sayde Paterne was greuously hurte, and many of the other in lykewise, &amp; some slayne.
                     wherof whan Clodoueus had wrytynge / he beynge therwyth greatly amoued, and also bycause ye Gothys dysobeyde the foresayd awarde: he gadered shortly after a greate hoste. And after certeyne offerynges done to saynt Martyn / wyth also passyng the ryuer of Uian by myracle and ledynge

of an harte: he lastly came to the syghte of hys enemyes. Thenne Clodoueus lodged hys hoost nere vnto the monastery of saint Hillary / where in the nyght before ye batayle, he receyued tokens of vyctory, the whyche I passe ouer.
                     And vppon the morne he set hys people in araye, and made towarde hys enemyes / and mette wyth them in a felde called Noglodien̄, nere vnto ye ryuer of Cleue or Clyue. where after sore and longe fyght / he slewe the abouesayde Alaricus kynge of Gothys (as sayth myne authour) wyth hys owne hande.
                     But here shulde seme some discorde of tyme wyth other wryters. For Cronica cronicarum, Iacobus Philippus, and other / testyfye that thys Alaricus was dede many yeres before. For he shulde be kynge of Gothys by theyr sayenge in the tyme yt Honorius brother vnto Archadius was emperour whyche was aboute the yere of our lord .iiii. hūdred &amp; .ix. that he began hys empyre. wherfore mayster Robert Gagwyne meaneth some other kynge of Gothys than Alaricꝰ. For the sayd authours also affyrmen, that this Alaricus dyed of sodayne sykenesse at a cytye named Cesancia / whā he had reygned after moste wryters .vi. yere.
                     Then it foloweth in ye story / whan Clodoueus had thus opteyned vyctory of the Gothys, and set the countre of Guyan in order: he sped hym agayne into Fraunce.
                     And when he was comen into the countre of Turon̄ / he was encoūtred wyth embassadours of themperours Anastasius, and presented from the sayd emperour wyth gyftes &amp; greate pryce and honour, and also admytted for a consull of Rome, whyche at that dayes was a dygnyte of moste honour. whyche done, he remytted the sayd embassade wyth great gyftes. This sayenge is affyrmed of the other wryters / the whych shewe this honour to hym to be done, for as mych as he had ouercomen the Gothys, enemyes of Crystes fayth. But they name not the kynges name that then reygned ouer the Gothys.
                     Thys besynesse ouerpassed / Clodoueus contynued hys iourney tyll he came to the monastery or chyrche of faynt Martyn. where wyth great deuocyon accordyng to hys former promysse / he offered his stede that he occupyed that iourney agayne the Gothys. And after for that he entended to occupye the sayd hors yf he hadde lyke nede: he redemed hym wyth a competent summe of golde. But yet the hors myghte not be remoued. Then ye kyng added to an hundreth pecys of golde / which at those dayes were named golden shyllynges / and so receyued hys stede. wherfore the kynge sayd after in game, that saynt Martyn was a good helper at nede / but he was costelewe.
                     Thus thys noble and fyrste crysten prynce cōtynued hys lyfe in noble and marcyall dedys / in augmentynge hys kyngdome by knyghtly batayles and other worldy prouysyons / and lastly dyed of goddes visytacyō with all stedfastnes of fayth, whan he hadde reygned .xxx. yeres / leuyng after hym .iiii. sonnes of Clotylde hys wyfe / that is to saye Clodomyrus, Chyldebertus, Theodoricus, and Clotharius / or after some Latarius / and was buryed in ye monastery that he before nere vnto Parys hadde buylded, wyth suche epytaphy or superscripcyon vppon hys tumbe as after shalbe shewed.
                     But or I procede to the declaryng of the foresayd epitaphy / for so mych as I haue hard dyuers hold an opynyon, that the fayth of Cryste was

receyued in Fraunce or it were receyued in this lande of Brytayne: therfore I shall note here the tyme that this Clodoueus fyrst toke baptyme. whyche was as Ranulphe monke &amp; other testyfye, in the .xv. yere of hys reygne / or nere about. whyche was ye yere of our lord .iiii.C.lxxx. &amp; .xix.
                     wherby yt apperyth, consyderynge the tyme of Luciꝰ fyrst crystē prynce that euer was of Brytayne as before is shewed / that Cristes fayth was by a longe tyme honoured in Brytayn, or it were honoured in Fraunce / excepte that suche as holde the forsayd opynyō, accompte the fyrste comyng of Crystes fayth into Brytayne at ye fyrste conuersyon of the Saxons, whenne yt was prechyd by the holy monke saynt Augustyne and hys felowes / whych is not to the purpose. Than to the foresayde epitaphy or superscrypcyon as foloweth.

                        VTer the laste or yongest sonne of Cōstantyne, and brother of Aurelius / was made kyng of Britayn in the yere of our lorde .v. huudred euen / and the .xvi. yere of Clodoueus than kynge of Fraunce. Thys as before ys touched, was surnamed Pendragō. The cause therof was as wytnessyth ye Englysshe cronycle, for so mych as Merlyn lykened hym vnto a dragō vnder a sterre apperynge in the firmament. wherof there is made a long processe, and by Gaufryde in his Brytyshe boke also affermed / the whych to me semeth of lytell credēce. But trought it is, that after Uter was (as before is sayde) made kynge / he was enamowryd vppon the dukes wyfe of Cornewayll named Igwarne or Igorne / &amp; for to optayn his vnlefull lust, sought many &amp; dyuers meanes. So ye lastly he made warre vpō her husbāde named Garolꝰ or Gorleis / &amp; at lēgth slew ye
                        
sayde duke at his castell called Tyntagell, standynge in Cornewayle / &amp; after maryed his wyfe, and receyued of her the noble knyght Arthur, and a doughter named Amye, as sayth the englyshe cronycle.
                     More is not lefte of any wryter of authoryte in remembraunce of thys Uter / all be it that some testifye, that he by the helpe of Merlyne shulde fetche Coria gigantum otherwyse called the stone henge, out of Irlād as before I haue shewed in the story of Aurelius. And of Gaufryde ys shewed, that Uter also shulde wynne the forsayde ladye by the enchauntement of Merlyn. whych is not comely to any chrysten relygyon to gyue to any suche fantastycall illusyons any mynde or credence. wherfore I passe ouer, leuynge all the other mater, whych also ys there rehersyd of the warre betwene Uter and Osca, sonne of Hengyste, for so mych as it is dyscordaunt vnto other wryters / and fynally conclude that thys Uter Pendragon dyed by force of venym, when he hadde ruled thys yle of Brytayne by the full terme of .xvi yeres / and after was buryed by his brother Aurely in Coria gigantum or stone henge, leuynge after hym the forenamed sonne the puyssaunt Arthur.
                  
                  
                     Francia. THE .CI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        LOtharius or Clotharius the yongest sonne of Clodoueꝰ / was made kynge of a parte of Fraunce called Soisons, in ye yere of our lorde .v. hundred and .xiiii / and the .xiiii. yere of Uter then kynge of myche Brytayne. ye shall vnderstande that after the deth of Clodoueus laste kyng of Fraunce / the lande by hym was dyuyded to hys foure sonnes. That is to say to the eldest sonne Clodomirus was appoynted the lordshyppe of Orlyaunce / to Theodoricus the seconde sonne Austracye / to Childebertus ye thyrd son myddell Fraūce, or the countre lyenge about Paris / and to this Lothayr, the aboue sayd lordshyppe of Soisons. Of whyche sayd lordshyppes eyther of them possessyd / they were of theyr subiettes called kynges, and so contynued in good reste a certayne of tyme. In the whyche season Clotyld theyr moder, berynge in mynde the vnnaturall deth of her parentes / wylled her sonnes to venge theyr deth. whych deth as testyfyeth Uincent historyall, and also Antoninus, was in this forme folowynge. Gundenchus the graūd father of Clotildis had .iiii. sonnes / that is to saye Cundebaldus, Gondigisillus, Hilpericus, and Godomarus: To these .iiii. sonnes Gundenchus besette the lande of Burgoyne. Gondigisillꝰ and Godomarꝰ dyed / wherfore the land of Burgoyne fyll to Cundebaldus and Hilpericus. Then Cundebaldus for couetyse of the hole lordeshyp, slew his brother Hilpericus / &amp; fastened a great stone to the necke of his wyfe, and cast her into a depe water. And of hys .ii. doughters, wherof the eldest hyght Trona / he exyled in poore wede or clothynge. And the yonger he kepte in seruage wythin his owne courte. The whyche after as before is shewed was maryed agayne hys wyll vnto Clodoueꝰ fader to this Lothariꝰ.
                     Then yt foloweth, this Lotharius sonne of Clotild made sharpe warre vpon Sigismonde sonne of Cundebaldus, whyche then was dede. In the whyche warre the eldest sonne Clodomyrus was slayne / leuyng after

hym .iii. sonnes named Theobaldus, Guntherus or Guntharre, and Clodoaldus. whych .iii. sonnes toke to her tuycyon and guydynge. But the other brother maynteyned the warre agayn yt Burgoyniōs / in such wyse ye finally they obteyned ye ryght porcyon of theyr moder Clotilde.
                     After thys warre was fynyshed in Burgoyne: Childebertus the thyrd sonne herynge that Almarcus kyng of Spayne mysse entreated his suster / made warre vppon hym, &amp; lastly hym subdued and sette his suster in her former estate.
                     But whyle the said Childebert was thus in Spayne occupyed: Theodorus his brother toke from hym a cytye to hym belongyng called Moūtclere / and slewe the knyghtes which Childebertus had lefte there to kepe the sayd cytye. For this myscheuous dede arose gret debate betwene these two bretherne / but by medyacyon of frendes they were at lēgth accordyd. Then Theodorus sought new meanes of dyspleasure agayne his sayde brother, as well treason as other wyse / the whyche Childebert by his polycye and wysedome &amp; wyth good fortune escapyd.
                     Childebertus than castynge in his mynde how he myght wynne to hym the patrymony or the lordeshyp that lately belōged vnto his eldest broder Clodomyrus: toke counsayle of his brother Clotharius. In such wyse yt they to gyder or of one assent, sent vnto theyr moder Clotyld for theyr neuewes, childern of theyr brother And she nothynge mystrustynge theym / sent the sayde childern vnto the sayd ii. brethern. But wythin shorte tyme of theyr commyng vnto theyr sayde vncles, as testifyeth mayster Robert Gagwyne, and also the frēche cronicle / Lotharius tyrānously wyth his sworde slew two of ye sayde childern. And then the thyrde fledde for his sauegarde vnto suche as hym fauouryd. He was after agayne taken and compelled to make a solemne othe, yt he shulde become a relygyous man, &amp; neuer clayme any part of his ryght or enherytaunce. By which vnlefull meane the .ii. brothern obteyned the hole lordshyppe of Orleaunce / and partyd the reuennues thereof betwene them / but that enduryd but a whyle. And here I passe ouer the sorowe that Clotylde made for the childern of her sonne Clodomyrus / and also the orderyng of the yongest son called Clodoaldus, whyche escaped the daunger of his vncles, as before is shewed / the whyche wolde aske a longe season.
                  
                  
                     THE .CII. CHAPITER.
                     IT was not long after but that the seconde brother kynge or duke of Austracy, dyed of goddes visytacyon / leuynge after hym a sonne named Theodobertus. The whyche of his two foresayde vncles was greuously warred by lōge tract of tyme, the whyche he defendyd thorough his marciall knighthode. And when he by dyuers meanes hadde sought peace, and myght not purchase it: he then founde suche meanes by ryche gyftes and otherwyse, that he wāne the fauoure of his vncle Childebert / and cherysshyd hym as his frende. Then fyll vnkyndnes betwene Childebert and Lotharius / in so myche that eyther of thē assembled a great hoste to subdue that one the other. But the forenamed Theodobertus made all ye power he myght, to ayde and assyste Chyldebert. So that vppon bothe partyes was a great multytude of knyghtes armed redy to fyght. Clotilde then herynge of this mortall warre betwene her two sonnes / and also consyderynge the lykelyhode

of the great effusyon of mannes blood that myghte ensue, by the reason of the ioynynge of these foresayd two hostes: in all hast yode vnto the sepulture or shryne of saynt Martyn. where wyth due deuocyon she made her specyall prayers / besechynge god and that blessyd saynt to sende by heuenly power some let or impedyment, yt the sayd hostes shuld not ioyne in batayll. By meane of whyche prayer when the sayde two hostes were in preparyng for to haue ronne to gyther: sodeynly fyll suche a tempeste of wynde and hayll wyth thunder and lyghtnynge, that bothe hostes were so greuously beten with the sayde tempeste and wederynge, that eyther of them had most mynde how they myght defende them selfe from daunger of the said wederyng. And ouer that, as testyfyeth ye aboue named Authour / eyther of the hostes thought in theyr myndes, that they were chased of theyr enimies / in such wyse that eyther of them fledde from other by a longe space.
                     After this eyther of them sent meanes of treatyse eyther to other / and at length confermed a peace betwene them. The whyche peace surely on both partyes assured Childebert excytyd his brother to warre vppon a people or countre called Terra Conens̄ in the prouynce of Spayn, and besegyd the cytye of Saragounce otherwise called Augusta / &amp; fynally kept the cytesyns so shorte, that they to appeace theyr enimyes, caused the byshoppe of the cytye to open the sepulchre of saynt Uyncent, and gyue to Lotharius a parte of y• holy martyrs bodye.
                     But yet that notwythstandynge / though the syege were wythdrawen and the cytye sparyd: yet the countre there aboute they pylled and wasted wythoute pyte. And after wyth great rychesse of praye, retourned in to Fraunce. where at Paris by Childebert soone after was builded a monastery in the worshyppe of god and of saynt Uincent / where the foresayd relyke was sette and reuerētly kepte. whych monastery at this daye is called saynt Germayns de Pree.
                     In thys whyle, I can not saye by what happe / these two brethern newly malygned agayne theyr neuewe Theodobert the son of theyr brother Theodorich. And entendyd by they

                        ceyued .vii. sonnes &amp; two doughters. Of the whyche Cramyris the eldest sonne he sente into Guyan, to haue the rule therof vnder his father. But he contrary to hys fathers mynde / oppressyd the inhabytauntes therof wyth greuous exaccyons and tribute / wherfore hys father beynge dyscontent, called hym thens. Cramyris wyth this beynge sore amoued / in great angre departed his fathers courte, &amp; yode vnto Childebert hys vncle, excytynge hym to make warre

vppon hys father / imagynynge fals occasyons to bryng the two brethern at dystaunce / and made a solemne othe to his vncle, that durynge hys lyfe he shuld strēgth his party agayn his owne father. whyche assuraunce thus made, Chyldebert preparyd hys hoste to warre agayne his brother Lothariꝰ. But ye sayd Lothariꝰ of this beynge warned / for such lette as he then haddde, sent agayne hys enymyes two sonnes of hys, named Gunthranus and Aribertꝰ / &amp; whyle these two fonnes made toward Childebert, he in that whyle made great waste in the countre of Champayne / and takynge great pryses, returned into hys owne countre of myddell Fraunce. wherof herynge the forenamed Guntranus and hys brother / and also that in Guyan was moued warre by Cramyr̄: spedde them thyder wyth all theyr people. But they dydde nothynge worthye memorye or laude.
                     In thys season dyed the forsayde Chyldeberte brother of Lotharius wythout heyre / when he hadde ruled myddell Fraunce .xivii. yeres, as sayeth the Frenche cronycle / and was enterred in ye monastery of saint Uyncent, otherwyse called saynte Germayne de Pree.
                  
                  
                     THE .CIII. CHAPITER.
                     AFter the deth of Childebert / for so myche as he dyed without heyre, Lotharius forenamed seasyd all myddell Fraunce into his possessyon. And after he hadde somdele sette yt in order / not forgetynge the innaturall rebellyon of hys son Cramyris: chase vnto hym a puryd company of knyghtes and of competent nomber / &amp; in all haste made toward Guyan, where ye sayd Cramyr̄ was then abydynge. But when he harde of the cōmynge of his father agayn hym with his chosyn armye: he withdrewe hym to the vttermost partyes of Fraunce / and requyryd ayde of a kynge or duke to that partye adioynynge named Gonobalde / the which to hym promised ayde to his power.
                     Lotharius of this affinyte beyng warned / pursued the sayde Gonobalde so sharpely, that he constrayned hym at length to take the chyrch of saynte Martyne, and to holde yt for his sauegarde. But when Lotharius had assayd by dyuerse meanes, as well by fayre promyse as wordes of Manasses, and myght not get the sayde Gonobalde oute of that holy place: he set the chyrche on fyre, and brent the duke in the same / the which shortely after he reedifyed and made in more better maner then yt before hadde ben.
                     when Cramyris was thus dispoynted of ye ayde of Gonobalde: he then fledde into lyttell Brytayne, and requyred ayde of the erle therof named Cenabutus / where by comforte of yt sayde erle he assembled a great hoste to wythstand his father. wherof the father beynge asserteyned drewe towarde hym. And when both hostes were nere: they sent messagers to ye father to entreate a peace. But Lotharius included so many harde condycyons wythin the sayde peace / or as some writersmeane, Cramyris desyred such vnlefull desyres of his father / that the sayd treaty myght take none effecte. And for truste that he had in the Brytons and his strength he was vtterly bent to trye his cause by dynt of swerde.
                     Lotharius hauynge experiēce that fortune of batayl is in victory doutfull &amp; vncertayne: he therfore made hys prayer to god / besechynge hym of ayde agayne the innaturall and obstynate rebellyon of his sonne.

After whych prayer endyd / he commaunded in the name of god to sette vppon his enymyes. whyche mette with so grete ire / that shortly ye grene feld was dyed into a perfyght redde / and many knyghtes vpon both partyes laye slayne, and gruntynge vppon the erthe. The father comfortynge and callynge vpon his knyghtes vppon the one parte, and the son vpon his knyghtes vpon that other parte / eyther of them entendynge ye deth and vtter destruccyon of eche other / thus this batayll hangynge in suspence to whether of them the vyctorye shuld turne: sodeynly the Britons gaue backe / and gaue place to the Frenchemen. wyth the which the French partye beyng cōforted / enforced yt Britons wyth so sharpe fyght, that they were compelled to forsake the felde, and toke theym to flyght / whom the Frenchemen chasyd and slewe wythout mercy.
                     In the whyche chase Cramyris wyth hys wyfe and chyldern were taken and presentyd vnto Lotharius. The whyche shortly after, settynge a parte all faderly loue, compassion, and pytye, causyd a great fyre to be made / into the whyche he commaunded to be caste the sayde Cramyris with also hys wyfe and chyldern. Or as wytnessyth the frenche cronycle, they were all enclosyd in a house / and the house and they to gether consumyd wyth fyre.
                     Thus the moste cruell father without pyte chastysyd ye inobedyent son, to the example and lernyng of other, to bere dewe obedyēce vnto theyr parentes. After this vyctory and cruell chastysement executed by Lothariꝰ: he retourned into Fraunce. And so to the sepulcre or shryne of saynte Martyne / yeldynge to god and hym thankes of thys vyctorye, and offeryd there many &amp; ryche gyftes. And after spedde hym to Soisons / where he as kynge of all Fraunce / excepte the lordshyppe of Austracy, whyche Theobald sonne of his brother sons Theodorich then helde. The father of this Theobald was Theodobert. Then Lotharius seynge hys lande in reste and quyetnesse / gaue hym to huntynge and chace of wylde bestes, a game of great vse amōg all Frēche prynces.
                     In whyche dysporte he beyng one daye greatly trauayled, caught some surfet / of the whyche ensued a mortall sykenes, so that he dyed shortely after, when he hadde reygned as before is specifyed ouer the lordshyppe of Soysons and other, by the terme of .l. wynter full. And was after buryed at Soisons with great pompe / leuynge after hym foure sonnes, Gū
                        thranus, Aribertus, Chilpericus, &amp; Sigebertus.
                     It is testyfyed of mayster Robert Gagwyne, that saynte Radegunde borne of the countre of Thurynge, of a pagan father named Bernigarius, was wyfe to this Lothar̄. whose vertuous lyfe Antoninꝰ in his boke called Sm̄ Antonini, in the .viii. chapyter &amp; .xii. tytle of the seconde parte of his worke, shewyth cōpēdyously.

                        ARthurꝰ the sonne of Uter Pendragon a strepelynge of .xv. yeres of age beganne his reygne as kynge of Brytayne, in the yere of oure lorde v. hundred and .xvii / and the thyrde yere of Lotharius, then kynge of Fraunce, or of a parte therof, as before is declared. Of this Arthure is

by Gaufryde recyted a longe storye, and alowed by the englysh cronycle, the whyche from other wryters ys greatly dyscordaunte. But yet all authours agreen that he was noble an victoryous in all his dedys.

And somwhat to the honour of so great a champyon as was thys Arthur, I shall lay vnto the reder, that he may wyth authoryte shewe vnto the herers / and ther wyth gladde the welsheman that he shuld descēde of so noble a vyctour / whych so many dedys of honour executed in his dayes.
                     Then as testyfyeth Polycronycon and other / Arthur faught .xii. no table batayllis agayne the Saxons, and of them all was victour.
                     wherfore the fyrste was vpon the ryuer of Cleuy / and .iiii. the nexte were foughten vpon the ryuer Douglys, which rynneth vnder the town of wygan, vpon ten myles from the ryuer of Merse in Lancashyre.
                     The .vi. batayll was vppon the ryuer called Bassa.
                     The .vii. besyde Lyncoln̄ in a wood called Celidon̄.
                     The .viii. and the .ix. were foughten about yorke.
                     The .x. was about Nycolf towne, whyche is named warwyk as after some wryters.
                     The .xi. was at Bathe / where he longe besegyd Cerdicus kynge of westsaxons.
                     The .xii. and last was at a place called Badon or Babowe hyll / in which he slewe many Saxons. But that notwythstandynge he myght not clerely voyde them his lande / but that they kepte theyr coūtes, which they were before possessyd of / as Kente, Southerey, and Norff: all be it that some authours testyfy that they held these countres as trybutaryes vnto Arthure.
                     Thys noble warryour as wytnessyth holy Gildas, slew with his own hande in one daye by ye helpe of our ladye saynte Marye / whose picture he bare peynted in his shelde, a hundred and .xl. Saxons. whyche shelde he called Prydwen̄ / his swerd was called Caliboure / and his spere was called Ron̄, after the brytyshe tunge or speche.
                     The thyrde or fourth.
                  
                  
                     THE .CV. CHAPITER.
                     
                        ABout the .v. yere of this Arthur, after the agrement of moste wryters beganne the lord shyppe of westsaxōs, vnder ye Saxon called Cerdicus &amp; Kenricus hys sonne. For Denys and other wytnesse, that this lordshyppe or kyngdome shulde haue his begynnynge the .lxxi. yere. after the fyrste commynge of Hengiste / or the yere of oure lorde fyue hundred .xxii. which agreeth wyth the .v. yere of Arthure aforesayde.
                     Thys lordshyppe conteyned the weste countre of Englande / as wylt

wyltshyre, Somersetshyre, Berkꝭ, Dors. and other / as Deuonshyre, and Cornewayll / and hadde in the Eest syde Southampton / in ye north Thamys the famouse ryuer / in the south and weste the see Occean.
                     This foresayde Cerdicus, whyche of some authours is named Childricus / lāded fyrst at Cerdyshore which nowe is called yermouth, an hauen towne in the countre of Norff. And by helpe of other Saxons then inhabyted in that countre then called eest Anglys: the sayd Cerdicus at lēgth obteyned the foresayde countre and named yt westsaxon or westsaxonia / and reygned therin as lorde or kyng a certayne of yeres, and Kenricꝰ his sonne after hym.
                     The fyrste chrysten kynge of this prouynce was named Kyngilsus / and cōuertyd by meanes of that blessed man Berinus byshoppe of Dorchester. To whom Quichelinus brother of the foresayd Kyngilsus, gaue the sayd cytye to make there hys see, after he also had receyued baptyme of the sayde Berinus. And as Guydo wytnessyth the sayde Quichelinus gaue after to the byshoppe of wynchester .vii. myles compasse of lande, to buylde there a byshoppes see / the whyche was accomplyshed and finyshed by Kenwalcus his son. Thys kyngdome enduryd longeste of all the other / whyche were .vii. in nomber, or .vi. besyde thys. Some wryters accompte the terme of the duraunce of thys kyngdome, from Cerdicus to Egbert / and some to the laste yere of Aluredus. But Guydo accomptyth the enduraunce of thys kyngdome, from the fyrste yere of Cerdicus vnto the laste yere of Edwarde the cōfessour. By reason wherof yt shuld endure fyue hundred and &amp; .liiii. yeres. But moste accordyngly yt shulde be rekened from the fyrst yere of Cerdicus to the laste yere of Aluredus. For he made one monarchye of all .vii. kyngdomes / in which tyme dyd flowe or passe thre hūdred lxxviii. yeres.
                  
                  
                     THE .CVI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        NOwe then I wyl returne vnto Arthur / the whych by a longe tyme dwelled in warre and mortall batayll wyth ye Saxōs, by meane of theyr dayly repayre into this lande. The whyche also alyed them with Pictes and other nacyons, and made theyr partye the strenger by ye meane. But yet Arthur by his marciall knyghthod brought theym in suche frame / that he was accōpted for chyef lord of Brytayne.
                     Fynally when he hadde by a longe tyme maynteyned hys warres agayne the Saxons / and specyally agayne Cerdicus or Childricus kyng of westesaxons: he for a fynall concorde gaue vnto the sayde Cerdicus as testyfyeth Policronica in the .vi. chapyter of his .v. boke. the two coū
                        tres of Hampshyre and Somerset. And when he hadde sette hys lande in some quietnesse, he betoke the rule therof vnto hys neuewe Mordred / and wyth a chosyn armye sayled, as sayth Gaufryde and other, vnto Fraūce / where by the reporte of Gaufryde he wrought wonders.
                     But the wryters of Frenche cronycles touche nothynge of suche notable dedes / nor yet the wryters of Romaynes mynde nothynge of suche actes done agayne theyr consull or emperoure called by Gaufryde Lucius Hybertꝰ. Therfore I wyll spare all that longe mater: remyttyng the welshemen as touchynge ye processe

vnto the sayd Gaufride. And here I wyll folowe Policronicon, where he sayth, that for as mych as the forenamed Mordred was desyrous to be kynge / &amp; feryd some dele the myght of Cerdicus kyng of westsaxons: he therfore drewe to hym the sayde Cerdicus by great gyftes, as of townes and castelles &amp; other meanes / where thorough the sayd Cerdicus to hym assented, so that Mordred was at London crowned kyng of Brytayn / and Cerdicus after the vse of pagās was at wynchester then called Kaerguent crowned kyng of westsaxons.
                     when relacyō came to Arthur of all this treason wrought by his neuewe Mordred: he in all haste made towarde Brytayn, as yt is redde in the englyshe cronycle / &amp; lāded at Sandwyche, where he was mette of Mordred and hys people / whych gaue vnto hym strong batayll in tyme of his landyng, and loste there many of his knyghtes, as the famouse knyghte Gawyne and other. But yet this not withstandyng Arthur at lēgth wāne the lande, and chasyd his enymyes / and after the enterynge of his cosyn Gawyn and other of his knyghtes there slayne, he sette forwarde his hoste to pursue his enymyes. Mordred thus beynge ouersette of his vncle at the see syde / withdrewe hym to wynchester. where he beynge furnysshed of newe soudyours, gaue vnto Arthur, as sayth Gaufryde, ye secōde fyghte / wherin also Mordred was put to the worse, and constrayned to flee. Thyrdely and lastely the sayde Mordred faught wyth his vncle Arthur besydes Glastynbury / where after a longe and daungerouse fyght, Mordred was slayn / &amp; ye victorious Arthur wounded vnto the deth / and after buryed in the vale of Aualon besyde Glastynbury beforesayde.
                     Of this laste ende and buryenge of Arthur in the brytyshe bokes are tolde many fables. But to oppresse ye errours of Brytons ye thynke or byleue yt Arthur yet lyueth: Policroniconshe with in his forenamed chapyter of his .v. boke, yt in the secōde Henryes tyme kynge of Englande the bonys of the sayd Arthur and Gwaynour his wyfe were foūden / and trāslated into the forsayde chyrch of Glastynbury, and there newe buryed in the yere of our lord .xi. hundred .lxxx. And more specially yt is noted in the xxiii. chapyter of the .vii. boke of Policronicon aboue sayde.
                     wherfore to be at cōclusyon of a fyne of this noble warryour / he was as before is shewed slayne or wounded to deth, when he hadde reygned ouer the Britons by ye terme of .xxvi. yeres / wyllynge before his deth that Constantyne the son of Cador duke of Cornewayle, for so mych as of his bodye remayned none heyre, that he shulde be his heyre and enheryte the land of mych Britayn after his deth.
                  
                  
                     Anglia. THE .CVII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        CONstantinus the son of Cador duke of Cornewayle / by assent of the Brytons was of them crowned kynge of myche Brytayne, in the yere of Crystes incarnacyon fyue hūdred .xliii / and the .xix. yere of Lotharius then kynge of Fraunce. This was nere kynnesman vnto Arthur / and was by the two sonnes of Mordred greuously vexed, for so myche as they claymed the lande by the ryghte or tytle of theyr father. So yt betwene hym and them were foughten many and sondry bataylles. wherof nother

of place nor of tyme is left any conuenyent memorye / nor yet of the names of the sayde two sonnes.
                     But as dyuerse authours agreen, after these forsayde batayllys thus foughten / fynylly the two sonnes of Mordred were constrayned of pure force to seche strong holdes for theyr refuge▪ wherfore that one toke London, and that other wynchester.
                     wherof Constantyne beynge warned / lefte not tyll he had slayne that one wythin the monastery of saynte Amphiabil
                           •
                         at wynchester / and that other wythin a temple or chyrche of London, whych temple is named of Gaufryde an hous of freres. But ye sayeng is doutefull / for at that days yt is to be supposed that there was none hous of freres within London nor by a longe tyme after.
                     when Constantine hadde thus subdued his enymyes, and thought hymselfe in a maner of suertye of his regyon: then fortune as she hadde enuyed his glory, arreryd agayne hym his owne kynnesman named Aurelius Conanus / the whych agayn hym made mortall batayll / and finally or at the last slewe hym in ye felde, when he hadde reygned after most accorde of wryters .iii. yeres / the whych was then huryed at Stone hyenge by the sepulture of Uter Pēdragon / wyth great solemnytye.
                  
                  
                     THE .CVIII. CHAPITER.
                     AUrelius Conanus the cosyn of Constantync last named / was crowned kyng Brytayne, in the yere of our lord .v. hundred &amp; .xlvi / &amp; the .xxxii. yere of Lothariꝰ before named then kynge of Fraunce. This was noble and lyberall. But he was a man that cherysshed suche as loued stryfe and dyscencyon wyth in his lande / and gaue lyghte credence to them yt accused other, were yt ryght or wronge. And as testyfyeth Gaufryde and other / he toke by strength his vncle whyche of ryght shulde haue ben kyng, and caste hym in a strong pryson / and after s
                           •
                        ew tyrannously the .ii. sonnes of his sayd vncle. But he reioysed his reygne but shorte whyle. For as wytnessyth the sayde Gaufryde, when he hadde reygned two yeres he dyed, were yt of the sonde of god or otherwyse / leuynge after him a sonne named Uortiporius, as hath the authoure of the boke named Floure of hystoryes.
                     Of this Uortiporius speketh nothynge the englyshe cronycle / but telleth of two kynges that shulde reygne nexte after Constantyne both at ones / wherof that one he nameth Adelbryght, and that other Edyll. wherunto none other writer agreeth except that he nameth them for some of the kynges of the Saxons. For aboute that tyme reygned in kent or soone after, Ethelbert or Athelbert / whyche myghte be taken of some for Adelbryght. And that other whyche he named Edylf, myght be taken for Ella kynge of Southsaxons. But this Ella shulde not by concorde of wryters be lyuynge at this tyme. It myght wyth more conuenyency accorde, that yt shulde be a kynge of Deira or of Northūberlande named Ella, the whyche reygned more aboute this tyme and season.
                     Of these two kynges, the sayde englyshe cronycle telleth a longe processe / the whych for I fynde none authour of authoryte that wryteth or speketh of the same, I passe yt ouer.
                     ye shall also furthermore vnderstande, that after this daye the Brytons dayly dyscreasyd of lordshyppe and rule wythin Brytayne, &amp; drewe them towarde Cambyr or walys / so that the countre about Chestre was

the chyefe of theyr lordshyp wythin Brytayne. For dayly the Saxons landed wyth companyes, and occupyed ye princypall partes of ye same / as shortely here after shall appere.

                     THE .CIX. CHAPITER.
                     
                        IN the tyme of the reygne of this fore named Aurelius Conanus / as wytnessyth Polycronica, Guido, &amp; other: beganne the kyngdome or lordshyp of Brenicia vnder a Saxon named Ida / the yere of our lorde .v. hundred and .xlvii / and the seconde or laste yere of the sayd Conanus. Thys lordshyp was in the north parte of Brytayne / and grewe in short whyle more &amp; more, so that fynally it was named the kyngdome of Northumberlande. But ye shall vnderstande, that this lordshyp was fyrste deuyded in two kyngdomes / wherof the fyrste, as aboue is sayde was called Brenicia, and that other Deyra. The meris or markis of this kyngdome of Northūberlande were by Easte and by west the occean see / by south the ryuer of Humber, and so downwarde towarde the weste by the endys of ye shyres of Notynghm and Derby, vnto the ryuer of Merse or Mercia / and by north the Scottysshe see, whyche is called forth in Scottysh / &amp; in Brettyshe the werde.
                     The southsyde of thys lordshyppe was called Deyra, whyche is nowe called the bysshopryke of Durham, and the north syde was called Brenicia / whyche were than departyd or seuered by the ryuer of Tyne. Deyra conteyned the lande from Humber to the ryuer of Tyne / and Brenicia included the countree from Tyne to the Scottysshe see.
                     In Brenicia regned fyrste as is aboue sayd Ida or Idas / &amp; in Deyra regned fyrste Ella / whych lordshyppes began bothe within .iii. yeres. But in processe of tyme bothe in one were named the kyngdome of Northumberlande / whych so contynued somwhyle vnder one kynge, &amp; somewhyle vnder two, by the terme of .iii. hundred and .xxi. yeres, as sayth Ranulphe munke of Chester. And after furth contynued ye name vnder Saxons and Danes, tyll the comynge of Edredus brother of Ethelstane &amp; son of Edwarde ye elder. The whiche Edredus in the .ix. or last yere of hys reygne, ioyned thys to hys owne kyngdome. By which reasō it shulde seme, that thys kyngdome endured vnder that name vpon .iiii. hundred and .ix. yeres.
                     The fyrste crysten prynce of thys kyngdome was named Edwynus / that receyued the fayth of saynt Paulyne, as testyfyeth Guydo. In thys lordshyppe also were included these shyres and countrees nowe called yorke, Notyngham shyre or Snothyngham shyre, Derby shyre, ye bysshopryke of Durham, Copelande, and other.
                     Amonge the many kynges yt reygned in thys lordshyppe, whych after some wryters were to the nomber of xxiii. reygned one accōpted the .viii. kynge by Guydo, named Ethelfridꝰ &amp; sonne of Ethelricus. whych Ethelfridus destroyed mo Brytons than all ye other kynges of Saxōs. This was fader to saint Oswold &amp; Oswi.
                     He slewe also many of the Brytōs at a batayle that he had agayn them besyde Kaerlegyon or Chester, and two thousande and a hūdred of monkes of the house of Bangor, as it ys

testyfyed of Polycronicon in the .x. chapyter of hys .v. boke / the whyche monkes were comen thyder to praye for the good spede of the Brytons. And ouer thys forsayde nomber of monkes .l. fled / whereby they wyth theyr leder named Brucyuall were sauyd. Of suche a nomber of monkes of one house / myghte be demyd a wonder. But the sayd Policronica, wyth Guydo, and other wryters / affermyn that in that house of Bangor were at those dayes for the more party thre tymes. vii, hundred monkes, the whych lyued by the trauayle of theyr handes onely.
                     The forenamed Oswye, was after Oswolde kynge of thys prouynce / whych gaue wyth hys doughter Elfleda a nonne .xii. lordshyppes into ye chyrche, to buylde wyth .xii. monasteryes / whereof .vi. of the sayde lordshyppes were in Brenicia, and .vi. in Deyra / as sayth Guydo. And also Ranulphe in hys .v. boke of Polycronyca and .xvi. chapyter affermyth the same.

                     UOrtiporiꝰ sonne of Aureliꝰ Conanus after the opynyon before sayd / was ordeyned kynge of Brytayne in the yere of our lorde .v. hundred and .xlviii. and the .xxxiiii. yere of Clotharius thenne kynge of Fraunce. Of the whych is lytell memory lefte in any cronycler or wryter / excepte yt Guydo testyfyeth hym to be a vyctoryous knyght / shewyng breefly that he in sondry batayles scomfyted the Saxons / and defendyd hys lande and Brytons from ye daunger of them and other that the Saxons alyed them wyth.
                     In the tyme of the reygne of thys kynge / a Saxon named Ella the son of Iffus, began to reygne in ye south syde of the kyngdome of Northumberlande called Deyra / as before is touchyd in the chapyter of the sayde kyngdome.
                     Then yt foloweth / whan this Uortiporius hadde ruled the Brytons knyghtly by the terme of .iiii. yeres / he dyed, and was put to hys fader / leuynge none heyre of hys body.
                     For as myche as all wryters agreen, that the kynges of westsaxon at length subdued all the other kyngdomes / and made of the hole land of mych Brytayne but one kyngdome or monarchye / and all other as well of Brytons as of Saxons fayled or lefte of, that all onely excepted: therfore I entende to brynge in, the name of euerych kyng of westsaxon frō the fyrst Cerdycus or Chyldricus, &amp; ioyne them wyth the kynges of Brytons / for so long as hereafter ye sayd Brytons contynued theyr reygne wythin any parte of Brytayne.

Thys Malgo after ye accorde of all wryters that make mencyon / was ye comlyest and moost personable man of all Brytons than lyuyng, &amp; therewyth endowed with knyghtly manhode. The whyche wythstode ye Saxons and kepte them of, that they damaged not the lande / the whyche he then had possessyon of. And as wytnessyth Gaufryde &amp; other / he by hys manhode subdued ye iles of Iseland,

Orchades or Orkeys, and Norway wyth other.
                     In the tyme of the reygne of thys Malgo / reygned in the lordshyp or kyngdome of Kent Ethelbertus / the whych as wytnessyth Polycronycō, assembled an hoste of hys knyghtes, and gaue batayle vnto Ceawlmus sonne of Kenricus and then kyng of westsaxon / the cause whereof ys not expressyd. But thys batayle was ye fyrste batayle that was foughten by twene the Saxons, after that they opteyned lande and dwellynge with in Brytayne / whyche was foughten in a place called wylbaldowne. And in the fyghte was slayne .ii. dukes of Ethelbertus / and hym selfe with his people chasyd.
                     Also yt'ys wytnessyd of the sayde Polycronica, that ye yere folowynge Cutwolfus the brother of Ceawimꝰ before named / faughte strongely agayn the Brytons at Bedforde / and berafte them .iiii. cytyes or townes named Liganbroght, Egelsborgth, Besyngton, and Euysham.
                     Then to retorne agayn to Malgo kynge of the Brytons / the authour of the Floure of historyes sayth, that not wythstandynge the many vertues, the whyche god had endowed hym wyth / he lastely forgate god for sakynge all vertue, and gaue hym to sondry vices and synnes, wherof the odible synnes of Sodomy was one / wherfore fell to hym great ꝑsecucyō of hys enemyes the Saxons, as before sōdele is shewyd &amp; more ensueth
                     It was not longe after the forenamed batayle done at Bedforde / but that the foresayd Cutwolfus dyed. But yet hys sayd brother Ceawlmꝰ couetouse of worshyppe, maynteyned hys warre agayne the Brytons / so that after he made a newe voyage agayne them, and made of them an other scomfyture / &amp; toke from them ye famous cytyes of Bathe, of Glouceter, and w

By the whyche as yt shulde seme by the rehersall folowynge that he makyth of Gurmunde / that Careticus ruled the Brytōs nexte after the deth of thys Malgo / as when the tyme cometh more playnly yt shall appere. Then it foloweth aboute the .xxxiii. yere of thys Malgo / Ceawlmus before named gadered hys Saxons, and foughte wyth the Brytons at a place called Fechanlege. where after longe fyght Ceawlmus chasyd the Brytons, &amp; wan of them vyctory. But hys brother called Cutha, was slayne in ye fyght / for whom he made greate sorowe.

                        CHilpericꝰ the .iii. son of Lotharius or Clotharius before named / begā hys reygne ouer ye parte of Fraūce called Soysons, in the yere of oure lorde god .v. hundred .lxiiii / and the xiiii. yere of Malgo then kynge of Brytayne. Thys not beyng content wyth suche as hys fader had hym be set / so soone as the obsequy and enterremēt of his fader was fynysshed, he spedde hym vnto Parys and possessyd hym of hys faders treasoure. wherof his .iii. bretherne beyng warned

/ purchasyd to thē such frēdshyp of the nobles of Fraunce, that they vnwetynge theyr sayd broder hadde entre into Paris / and lykely to haue takyn hym there in, yf he had not the soner escaped.
                     For thys incōuenyence grete discē
                        cyon was lykely to haue growen by twene these .iiii. bretherne / hadde not ben the mediacyon of frendes vpon bothe partyes. The whyche by good &amp; polityke wayes, at length pacyfied all varyaūces amonge them / &amp; concluded for a fynall pease, yt eyther of the sayd bretherne shuld hold hym cō
                        tent with such porcyō as was before assygned to thē by theyr fader. That is to saye to the eldest brother named Aribertꝰ or after some wryters Cherebris, shulde falle the countrey that is lyenge about Paris called mydle Fraunce / to Guntranus shulde falle the prouynce of Orleaunce / and to thys Chylpericus / the prouynce of Soysons / and to Sygebertus the yongest brother, shulde belonge the countrey of Mees or of Austracy. whych lordshyp begynneth at Champeyne as affyrmeth the Frenche cronicle, and stretchyth to the lordshyp or prouynce of Lorayne vppon one parte, &amp; to Almayne vppō that other part. After which cōcorde &amp; agremēt thus fynysshed / eyther of ye sayd brethern depted vnto his ꝓper lordshyp
                     If I shulde here discribe the maners &amp; condycyons of these .iiii. prynces / or to expresse ye vnlauful lechery of the eldest brother Aribertus, in refusyng hys laufull wyfe Ingebryda or Ingeberta / or of the rauyshement of wyues &amp; virgyns by hym done / or yet the vnstablenesse of lyuyng that was also in ye seconde brother Guntranꝰ, with vertues and vyces of the other: I shuld therof make a longe worke. wherfore to brynge this story to some cōuenyēce, I thus begynne.
                     Trouth it is that thys Chilpericus or after some Hilpericus / toke to wyfe the doughter of the kynge of Spayne called Athanahildꝰ, whose name was Golsanda. The whyche had to hyr handmayden a mayde called Fredegunda, the whyche was of passyng beaute, and shappe of body. But to hyr was ioyned subtyll wyt and euyll condycyons / contrary to hyr lady and maysters, which was symple and of vertuous condycyōs.
                     To the yongest brother named Sigebert was coupled in mariage the syster of the sayde Golsanda named Brunechildis, or after ye Frensh cronicle Brunecheuste / a woman of peruers &amp; wycked cōdicyō as after shall appere. Then it foloweth, Chilperich within shorte tyme that he was thus maryed vnto Golsanda, caste vnlaufull loue vnto hyr woman Fredegūda. By reason wherof fell suche vnkyndnesse bytwene them, ye lastly she was foūden in her chamber dede and strangelyd wyth a corde / whych was done by the hande of hyr housbande, as testyfyeth ye frenche boke.
                     Then secondly he maryed a nother wyfe named Audouera a woman of great byrth: how be it myne authour nor yet ye frenche cronycle declaryth not her progeny / with ye which he cō
                        tynued &amp; kepte hyr after hyr honour. But yet he withdrew not hys vnlaufull loue frō ye forenamed Fredegūd.
                     In thys passetyme / cause of warre was moued bytwene Sigebert the yonger brother, and men of the countrey of Sweuy / for the whyche the sayde Sigebert requyred ayde of hys brother Chilperich. At whose request he in all haste assembled hys people and spedde hym towarde hys brother / leuynge hys wyfe greate wyth chylde, in the kepynge of the soresayde Fredegunde. Of the whyche wyfe as testyfyeth the Frenche

booke, he hadde before receyued .iii. sonnes named Theodobertus, Meronens, and Clodoueus.
                     It was not longe after that Chilperiche, as before is sayd, in ayde of his brother was departed / but that his wyfe was delyueryd of a doughter. And when thys chylde shulde be confermed of the byshoppe / this Fredegunde entendynge to make a deuorce betwene Chilperich &amp; his wife, by her subtyle and false coniectoure counsayled the quene that she shulde for the more honoure conferme her own childe. And the quene trustyng her counsayle / supposynge her counsayle hadde ben for the beste, confermed her owne chylde.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXIII. CHAPITER.
                     IN this whyle the kynge wyth his brother occupyed in warre agayne y• Suytzers or men of Sweuy / bare them so knyghtly, that they subdued theyr enymyes, and after retourned into theyr countres. wherof when Fredegunde was ware, she in secrete maner mette with the kynge / &amp; shewyd to hym all the demeanure of his wyfe, but nothyng of her own crafty workyng, wherewyth kyng was greuously dyscontente in shewynge of his outwarde contenaunce / and sayd, yf that were true, she shuld from hym be deuorcyd / and that she shulde be quene in her stede.
                     After this the kynge commynge to his paleys / the quene to the entēt to be the more accepted in his presence, not knowynge of the malicyous workynge of Fredegūde, brought in her armes the yonge baby, to the whych she was moder bothe naturally and spirytually / and welcommed ye kyng her lorde in ryght humble maner, salutynge hym wyth wordes of all cō
                        forte. But the kyng beynge warned of her symple demeanure / &amp; as some authours wryte, glad that he hadde occasyon to fynde mater to her of displeasure / blamed her in greuous maner, and commaunded her out of his presence for that tyme / &amp; after by coū
                        sayle of spyrytuall men, causyd her from hym to be deuorcyd / &amp; her wyth her yonge doughter to be put into an house of relygyon, to the whyche he gaue possessyons for the fyndyng of her and of her yonge doughter named Childeynda.
                     And when Chilpericꝰ hadde thus fynyshed this foresayde besynesse / he shortely after toke to wyfe the fornamed Fredegūd, not without grudge of some of hys lordes and other.
                     It was not longe after this maryage, that stryfe and discencyon fell betwene this Chilpericus and Sigebert hys brother / the whyche grewe for certayne lande that Chilpericus claymed to haue of hys brother afore sayde. Then Chilpericus assembled hys knyghtes and made warre vppon the lande of hys brother Sigebert / the whyche then was besyed in lyke warre agayne a people called Hunes / by reason wherof Chilpericꝰ hadde the more fordell, and wan by strength the cytye of Reynys.
                     But yt was not longe after or Sigebert was warned of his brothers vnkyndnesse. wherfore he after hys enymyes were by hym somdele subdued / went wyth hys armye into the countre of Soysons belongynge to his brother Chilpericꝰ / and warred in lykewyse in that lande as hys brother dyd in his / and at length toke ye cytye of Soysons, and therin the eldest son of Chilpericꝰ named Theodobert, and helde hym as his prysoner. Then Chilpericus herynge of the scomfyture of his people and takynge of his sonne, was agayne hys brother more feruently amoued / and

caste in his mynde all wayes &amp; meanes howe he myghte reuenge hym vppon hys brother. But yt was in vayne. For his brother at that tyme had such auauntage of hym / that he well apperceyuyd, that he had no better meane then a treaty of peace, by meane wherof he shortly after obteyned his sonne out of daunger, wyth other thynges concernynge his profyte / assurynge to hys sayde brother by solemne othe, that after that daye he shuld neuer were armes, nor yet warrey his brother.
                     This cōcorde and vnite in due maner fynyshed, &amp; suffycyently by both counsayles stablysshed / yet Chilpericus beynge alwayes mynded to be reuengyd vpon his brother Sigebert / sent his yongest sonne named Clodoueus, and caused hym to warre vpon a cytye called Burdeaux, in the pronice of Neustria / now called Normā dye. But by the manhode of a captayne of Sigebert named Singulphus, the sayd Clodoueus was ouer comen and compelled to voyde the countre, and so fledde to Paris.
                     For thys happe Chilpericus was fyryd with all malyce / and in all hast commaunded hys forenamed sonne Theodobert wyth a great armye to inuade the sayd coūtrey of Neustria, or Normandye. The whyche accordynge to hys fathers commaundement spedde him thyder / and there by hys extorte myghte and power, toke many cytyes and stronge holdes / not sparynge chyrches, howses of relygyon, as nunnes and other / and robbed and spoyled the countre in moste cruell wyse.
                     Lastly this persecucion thus done, a cheuetayne or duke named Gundoaldus of the erldome of Poitowe / assembled a great power, and wythstode Theodobert / and fynally slew hym in playne batayll, and a great parte of hys people. wherof herynge Chilpericus gatheryd a great hoste, and yode into the countrey of Champayne / wastynge and destroyenge the countrey wyth fyre and iron to the vttermoste of hys power, and at length toke the cytye of Reynes, and spoylyd yt wythout mercy.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXIIII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        SIgebertus aduertysynge / and castynge in hys mynde the innaturall dysposycyō of his brother / perceyuyng well that he entendyd hys vtter destruccyon: ꝓuyded in his beste maner for to wythstande his malyce. And for to brynge his continued malyce to a fynall ende / he gatheryd to hym a puysant power / and after sped hym towarde his sayd brother. wherof Chilpericus beynge aduertysed / by hys couert meanes sought ways of entreaty and peace, in suche wyse that or the hostes mette, a peace was concluded.
                     Then these two bretherne thus accordyd / condescendyd in shorte tyme after to make warre vppon theyr brother Gunthranus then lorde of Orleaunce / the whyche sygnory at that daye belonged to the countrey or prouynce of Burgoyne. The cause of this warre is not expressyd / except yt they enuyed theyr brother to haue so great lordshyp. But by medyatours on both partes / after great aray purueyed on all sydes, a concorde and peace was concludyd in the temple of saynt Lowpe at ye cytye of Trois in Uyncent.
                     when this sayd peace was fynyshed / the sayd .iii. brethern in syght departyd as frendes eyther of theym from

other. But as peace somtyme contentyth not saudyours / &amp; specially such as delyte them in pyllage and robbery: ryght so amonge the knightes of Sigebert was spronge a great rumoure / sayeng that they were not cō
                        tente and rewardyd for theyr great laboure and trauayle accordynge to theyr desert / and specyally for ye fyrst iourney of these .ii hadde agayne his brother Chilpericus / thynkynge the peace wyth hym made was nothyng honorable, consyderyng ye great doublenesse and vntrouth that in hym was prouyd. For the whyche they excytyd Sygebert in all that in theym was / to breke those boūdes of peace, and to make newe warre vpon hym. And in lyke maner some euyll dysposyd persons were more agreable to warre then to peace, vppon the party of Chilpericus, and murmured in lykewise. And for they thought to haue ben better rewarded of Sygebert, then they were of theyr own maister, they therfore lefte hym and yode to ye hoste of Sygeberte. By whose eueytynge &amp; report, Sygebert was more kyndelyd to sette vppon his brother.
                     Chilpericus hauynge notycyon of hys brothers purpose / wyth also the murmoure and departynge of hys knyghtes, and hauynge in the other somme mystruste: he anon wyth his wyfe and chyldren and chefe of hys treasoure, went vnto ye cyty of Tourney / entēdyng to kepe that for theyr and hys sauegarde. But when Sygebert knew therof, he was nothyng in the pursuynge of hym foūde slow / but foloweth streyght after, and closyd hym wythin the sayde cytye with a stronge syege / where Chilpericus was in a maner dyspayred of ye welfare of hym &amp; hys Fredegunde. But she that was replenyshed of all iniquyte, called to her two wycked persones / and promysed vnto theym great gyftes, yf they wolde by venym or otherwyse slee her brother Sigebert. The whyche two felowes dysceyued wyth the fayre speche and great gyftes of the sayde Fredegunda, toke vppon theym that vnlefull charge / and by theyr subtell &amp; false imagynacyon, brought theyr cursed purpose to an ende / but to theyr owne confusyon. For after they had wounded the kynge Sygebert to deth, and wolde then haue escapyd / the kynges knyghtes espyeng theyr treason, fell soone vppon them, and all to hewed them. And when ye deth of the kynge was knowen / a great noyse and crye was areryd in the hoste. By meane wherof the kynges deth was blowen in to the cytye, and after to the ceres of Chilpericus / wherof he was not a lytell ameruayled, nor wolde to yt geue ferme credence, tyll he was enfourmed of hys wyfe Fredegunde of all hyr subtyle workynge.
                     It was not longe after or the knyghtes or some of the captaynes of the hoste of Sygebert presentyd thē vnto Chylpericus, besegynge hym of hys grace and pardon / the whych he gladly accepted. And when he hadde sette hys charges in order / he then commaunded prouysyon to be made for the beryenge of hys sayd brother wythin the monasterye of saynte Medarde of Soysons.
                     And when all that besynesse after a kyngely maner where fynyshed and endyd / he then exylyd Brunechyeldys and Childebert, the wyfe and sonne of hys brother Sygebert, vnto the cytye of Roane / takynge from theym great treasour that they were possessyd of. But shortly after the sonne of Sygebert by helpe of Gun debolde or Gundealde duke of Poy towe here before named / was delyueryd from the daunger of the sayde

Chilperycus, and sent into his owne lordeshyppe of Austracye, whych his father Sygebert was lorde of.
                     In thys passetyme he hadde sent hys sonne Meroneus into a coūtrey called Buturynges, to appeace certayne rebellyons there areysyd. But when he hard of the deth of his vncle Sygebert / and of the beynge of hys wyfe Bruncchyelde at the cytye of Roane / he sette a parte all the charge of his father, and sped hym streyght thyder, kepynge companye wyth her. In whome he toke suche consolacoin and pleasure / that lastely he maryed her, and kepte her as hys wyfe. And when hys father was therof warned / he feryd leste by the counsayle of hys sayde wyfe, he wolde arryse agayne hym / wherfore he in all haste assembled hys people, and spedde hym towarde Roane.
                     when tydynges came to Meroneus of the conunynge of hys father wyth so great araye / and he as then vupurucyed of strength of knightes to resyste hys father / for hys moste suertye fled wyth hys vnlefull wyfe to the temple or chyrche of saynte Martyne, takynge the pryuylege therof for theyr defence. And when Chilpericus hadde temptyd by many sondry meanes to haue them out of the sayde pryuylege, and myghte not wythout brekynge of the same: he to brynge aboute hys cautelouse purpose, made to theym assuryd promyse, that yf they wyllfully wolde renounce the sayde place, and putte theym in hys grace / he wolde vtterlye pardon theyr trespace, and suffer theym from that tyme for to contynue theyr lyfe to gether as man and wyfe. Uppon whyche promyse the sayd Meroneꝭ wyth his wyfe renoū
                        ced the sayde pryuylege, and putte theym hole in the kynges mercy / the whyche them receyuyd wyth all contenaunce of loue and fauoure, and theym festyd and cherysshyd louyngly, by the space of two dayes onely. But the thyrde daye the feaste was fynyshed / for then he sent his sonne vnto Parys vnder sure guydes / and there causyd hym to be professyd in a house of relygyon. But by the meanes of hys vncle Gunthranus he was after taken thens / and so restoryd to hys former knyghthode. For the whych his father hym newly pursued and cōstrayned hym to take for hys sauegarde ye chyrche of saynt Martyne in Turon.
                     And when he was warned that his fader perforce wold take hym thens / he then fledde vnto a cytye of Champayne accompanyed wyth .vi. seruauntes onely / where he was in so great fere to be taken and in suche despayre to obteyne grace of hys father, that he causyd one of the sayde vi. persones to slee hym wyth hys sworde / &amp; the foresayd Bruncchyeldis hys wyfe put in sure kepynge.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXV. CHAPITER.
                     
                        CHilpericꝰ then beynge asserteyned of the doth of hys sonne Meroneus, &amp; the sure kepyng of Brunechieldis, he thoughte hymselfe somdele assuryd / for ye mystruste yt he had in them many tymes inquieted hym. But yet he was not ī quiete or reste. For shortly after ye peple of Turon rebellyd agayne him. Agayn whom he sent his son Clodoueus / &amp; a noble man of his courte named Desideriꝰ, ye which he sent as a gyde &amp; a counsayloure of his sayd son. And vpon the party of his enymyes was a captayne of the kynge Gunthranus / for so mych as the said Gunthranus claymed parte

of those landes about Turon. This captayne named Momelues heryng of the cōmynge of the foresayd hoste, wyth a chosen cōpany made taward them / and gaue vnto Clodoueus a great sharpe fyght / and not without great losse of his men wanne of hym the felde, and compellyd hym to forsake that countre.
                     Thus Chilperyche was wrapped in warre and troubles of the worlde, sometyme wyth ryght, &amp; some whyle wyth wronge / so that he some tyme wanne worshyppe and other whyle he loste. wherof to tell all the cyrcumstaunce I thynke yt shulde be tedyouse bothe to the reders / and also to ye herers. wherfore I passe ouer, in abrydgynge and shortynge somedele of this storye.
                     Then foloweth within ye storye / after Chylpericus had by intycemēt of Fredegunde / wrongfully tormentyd the archebyshoppe of Roan named Breteste, &amp; hym after the sufferaunce of many vylanyes exyled (for the whych and other god sent vnto hym some correccyom, in takynge awaye by sodeyne deth the chyldern that he had by Fredegunde) he then began to knowe god, and toke great repentaunce / in promysynge to god amendement of his lyfe. And to thentent that he might haue the more prayers of the comyn people to stand in state of grace: he fyrst releasyd a greuous trybute or imposicyon that he hadde lately sette vpon all vynes thorough his regyon. And that done he reedyfyed olde chyrches and some he made newe, and endowed them with great possessyons. And ouer thys he releuyd greatly ye poore people, by enlargynge of his lyberall almes / and became very humble and meke, where before tyme he was ryght sterne and cruell. But lyke as oftē it happeneth that hote loue is soone colde / so thys sodayne deuocyon was soone aswaged. For lyke as hys troubles began to aswage, and his prosperyte to encrease: ryght so hys olde cōdycyons beganne in hym to reuyue and quycken / so that at length he retourned to hys olde accustomed vyces.
                     In this tyme a pleople called Longobardes, and now Italyans / warred sore vppon the landes of the empyre. wherfore Mauricius then beynge emperour of Constantyne the noble / for so mych as he tought that the frenche kynges myght was lesse coste and payne to subdue them, then he myght beyng so farre from them / he therfore sent to hym a great sūme of golde / wyth letters of recommendacyon, exortyng hym in the defence of the chyrche of Rome, to assemble hys people and to withstande ye sayd Longobardes / and not to sease ther of tyll he hadde expellyd theym from the landes of the empyre.
                     whyche somme of golde he goodly receyuyd / promysynge to the bryngers therof, that he wyth all dylygence shulde execute the vttermoste of his power to accomplyshe the requeste of the emperoure. And accordynge to a parcell of his sayde promyse / he assembled a great people, and made towarde the sayde Longobardes. Of whom the sayde Longobardes ferynge ye great myght, made meane of entreaty / offrynge to hym great summes of money. By reason wherof he lefte theym in reste, and so retourned into Fraunce. when Mauricius had vnderstandyng yt the foresayde enymyes remayned styll in the foresayde landes, and contynued in theyr malice: he sent agayne to Chilpericus / requyryng hym other to performe his promyse or ellys to restore hys money, whych he had takē for ye perfourmaunce of the same. But all was in vayne / for he wolde neyther

execute that one nor that other. But at lēgth as affermeth myne authour, he was by goddes ordynaunce compelled for to restore the sayde money or a great parte therof, by meane of his suster wyth her chylde that was as a prysoner to the sayde emperour, whyche suster was before tyme maryed vnto the kynge of Spayne.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXVI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        CHilpericus thus encreasynge in vyce and dyshonoure, lastely repugned agayne god / so that he fell into that detestable heresye of the Arianes / and commaūded certayne artycles of the same touchyng the deuysyon of the trynyte to be prechyd thorough hys regyon. But the holy byshoppe of Towres withstode that precepte, and blamed hym greuously for that dede / all be yt the sayd bysshop named Gregory wyth great assystence of the other byshoppes of Fraunce, hadde great laboure to remoue hym from the sayde opynyon.
                     This with many other crymes passed by Chilpericus / Fredegunde, whyche euer encreasyd in peruerse &amp; malycyouse purpose, soughte many vnlefull meanes howe she myghte brynge to confusyon the thyrd sonne of her husbonde / knowynge well ye whyle he leuyd, her chyldern shulde neuer enheryte the crowne of Fraunce. This purpose to brynge about many and dyuerse wayes she attemted, whyche were longe to reherse. But fynally she causyd hym wrongfully to be accusyd, &amp; by meane therof to be caste in pryson. where he so beynge, she hyred a felon to sle hym / and after shewyd to her husbande yt the sayde Clodoueus hadde stayne hym selfe. In profe wherof she hadde appoynted the foresayde murderer to leue a sworde styckyng in hym, as thoughe he hadde wylfully slayne hym selfe vppon the same sworde. whyche when the kynge sawe / he demed hym gylty of such offense as before was putte vppon hym.
                     ye haue harde before of the sonne of Sygeberte named Childebert, that was delyuered from the handes of Chilpericus his vncle by the meanes of Gundoald duke or erle of Poitowe / the whyche in this tyme was growen to mannes stature and ruled at this daye his enherytaunce of Austracye, not wythout great stryfe had betwene hym and hys sayde vncle, whych were to long to wryte ye cyrcū
                        staunce therof. wherof at this daye somdele was vndyscussyd / all be yt they at thys daye vsyd eyther other as frendes.
                     About this tyme the other vncle of Chyldebert called Gūthranꝰ / sought occasyon agayne hym, for cause of a byshop named Theodorꝰ, &amp; byshop of Marsill or Marsyle / ye which was put from his see by Gūthranus, and receyuyd of Chyldebert, and by hym agayne restoryd to the sayde see of Marsyle. For the whych Gunthrane was sore amoued / and entendyd to make warre vpon hym. But by medyatours it was somdeale appeasyd and sette in quyete / vppon certeyne condycyons to be obserued and also perfourmed vpon the party of Gunthranus / the whyche after were not vppon his syde kept nor performed. wherfore after request to hym made for reformacyon of all such poyntes / and answere agayne receyuyd of no reformacyon: Chyldebert to haue hys partye the strenger / and also for that that he well knewe, that hys vncle Chilpericus bare towarde the sayde Gunthranus not very fraternall loue / he therfore sente vnto hym a noble man of hys courte named Gyllon, requiryng hym of ayde

agayne hys vncle / the whych by many-seasons had as well broken promyse agayne hym, as nowe he hadde agayne Childebert. Of this Chilpe riche beynge ryght fayne, assentyd to the desyre of Gyllon / and after in all haste preparyd theyr hostes / and by two sondry companyes inuadyd the countres of Orleaunce, wherof Gunthranus was kynge or ruler. But ye inhabytauntes of that prouynce defendyd theym in so stronge maner / yt theyr enymyes hadde of theym lytell auauntage. In whyche meane season Gunthranꝰ assembled a myghty hoste, and spedde hym towarde his enymyes, at a place called Mediolan̄, he supprysed a parte of hys sayd enymies / and after drewe nere to the great nomber of bothe hostes, where was made preparacyon on bothe sydes to haue foughten. But as before tyme ye haue often harde, that by discrete &amp; wyse men the fyght was put by, and meanes of accorde was founden: so nowe at this tyme by labour of good and wise prelates and other / these kynnesmen were sette in vnyte, and departed without great shedyng of crysten bloode.
                     In this passetyme / deth whych sparyth no creature, berafte Chilpericꝰ a sonne borne of Fredegūde and named Theodorus / for the whyche the kynge and also the quene toke great heuynesse. But as she yt was prōpte &amp; redy to all euyll / cast in her mynde that thys chylde was slayne by poyson, or by some other purposed malyce. For the whyche lastely was accusyd a baylyfe or lefe offycer called Monuole, with diuers wytches and sorseresses, that shuld imagyne this chyldes deth. The whych she payned and tormētyd in such wyse / that lastly the sayde wytches confessed, that they hadde destroyed the chylde, and not wythoute consente of the sayde Monuole. wherfore she after caused the sayde sorceresses to dye by cruell deth, as by fyre and otherwyse / and the sayde baylyffe to be so tourmentyd that he dyed soone after.
                     The frenche cronycle sayth, that by the meane of the takynge a way of the lyfe of the kynges chylde / a chyld of the sayde Monuole was restoryd to helth, whych before was in great ieoperdye / whyche is for folys to beleue. Thys sorow and heuenesse of Chilpericus and Fredegunde hys wyfe / was somdele aswaged by the byrthe of a son shortly after borne of ye sayd Fredegunde / whych the kyng lette call Lotharius, or Clotharius. For ioye wherof the kyng lette open the prysones / and suffred the prysoners to goo at theyr lyberte / and specyally suche as concerned causes touchynge hym selfe for dette or otherwyse, with other thynges cōcernyng hys honoure.
                     But lyke as dame Fortune is accustomed to medle her ioyes of thys world wyth some bytternesse: so dyd she now with Chilpericꝰ. For where he was nowe in great tranquillyte and reste / and thought to haue ladde the resydue of his lyfe in pleasure: so deynly word was brought vnto hym that hys brother Gunthranus, and hys neuewe Childebert / was allyed and fermely accorded to make warre vppon hym / for the whych they had assemblyd a great army. wherfore he in all haste commaunded all his treasour and chyfe iewellys to be had to the cytye of Cambria / where he wyth his wyfe and frendes entended to cō
                        tynue the resydue of his lyfe. And yt done spedde hym thyder in all haste / and fortyfyed the sayde cytye in such wyse, that he feryd lytle or nothynge hys enymyes / where he so kepte hym wythin the sayde cytye a certayne of tyme. And whē he sawe nor hard not

of the commynge of his sayd broder nor neuewe / he then walkyd more at large / and sportyd hym in haukynge and chase of the wylde bestes, as wolues and other / whych at those dayes was greatly vsyd of the kynges of Fraunce, and yet is contynued.
                     Uppon a day as he was purposyd towarde this dysporte, and all thyng redy preparyd for the same / so that the quene thought veryly he had be gone oute of the paleys / for what happe I can not tell, the quene yode into her chāber, and there rested her vppon her bedde. where she so lyeng the kynge passyd by / &amp; wyth a lytle wande, whych he bare in his hande, in maner of game strake the quene with yt vppon the backe. The quene supposynge the kynge had ben gone to the felde, and not lokyng vp sayd, Laundrye why dareste thou thus stryke me. This Laundrye was a great man in the kynges courte / and hadde ben peramoure to the quene longe tyme. But the kynge herynge these wordes, made semblaunt as he hadde not herde them, and so passyd on hys waye.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXVII. CHAPITER.
                     FRedegunda apperceyuynge &amp; after seynge yt was the kyng, to whome she hadde thus sayde / sore was abasshed, and in great fere and agony. And after she had by a longe season coniected in her mynde what remedy she myght fynde for this mishappe: she lastely dyuely shely determyned to sle her sayd husbande and lorde. And this to brynge about she sent in all haste for the sayde Laundrye, and shewed to hym in order all the cyrcumstaunce of the foresayde mater. wherafter he was strykē with suche a fere / that his wytte and counsayle faylyd hym to deuyse in such a case any remedy. wherfore the quene as she that was fully determyned to execute her detestable &amp; cursyd purpose / sayde to hym boldely: Laūdry thou seest well yt this case is brought to so strayte a poynt, that other thou muste thynke to destroy my lord and husbande, or ellys thou and I muste both be shamefully confounded. Of whyche thou well knowest our owne is moste to be regarded / therfore dyspose the to do after my counsayll. Thou knowest well that the kynge is accustomed to come late from hys dysporte. wherfore prouyde to the a certayne, that thou well trustyst / and in the euenynge when he retourneth aspye thy tyme and fall vppon hym sodeynly, and so rydde hym. And after make an out crye, &amp; sende to serch about as thou woldest take the homicydes / &amp; cause some of thyne own cō
                        panye to flee frō the, as though thou shuldest thē pursue. Laundry heryng this cursyd coūsayll, alowed it well &amp; therunto assentyd / and incontynently went aboute the perfourmaunce of the same. And when he hadde purueyde his accessaryes / he towarde nyght assemblyd thē, gyuynge to thē informacyon how they in yt mischyef shuld behaue them in that thyng, takynge of them assuryd othes, for kepyng of his coūsayle. The kyng not mysdemynge any thynge of thys conspyred treason / toke his delectacyon and pleasoure in folowynge of hys game, so that he loste myche of hys company / and towarde nyght as he before tyme was accustomed, wyth fewe accōpanyed drewe homewarde. wherof Laundry beyng warned / met the kynge salutynge hym and sayng that he was comen wyth hys company to cōdute hym home, for so mych as he douted how he was garnyshed of his meyneyall seruaūtes or other.
                     What shuld I lenger make delaye

or farther reharsall in thys matyer, or to tell the cyrcumstaunce of thys purposyd treason. But fynally when the kynge was nere hys paleys / or as reherseth the Frenche cronycle wythin the courte of hys paleys / as he lyght from hys horse he was sodeynly wounded to the herte, that he streyght fell to the erth dede.
                     After whyche murder thus commytted: a greate crye was areryd, the kynge ys slayne / so yt thys Laundrye made in great haste to be called certeyne persons to attende vppon ye corps, whyle he wyth other pursued suche as were dempte gylty of thys offence. But lastly he retourned, and sayd that thys dede was done by the knyghtes of Chyldebert / the whych by the derkenes of the nyght were escapyd.
                     To shewe here the vayne and dissymuled sorowe yt Fredegund made for the kynge, it were but lettyng of tyme. For euery wyse man knoweth well, that all suche as ben of that disposycyon, can fayne ryghte well in suche semblable casys. But to my purpose / when the kynge was thus slayne, and at that tyme nother the quene nor yet Laundrye suspectyd / prouysyon was made for enterryng of ye corps. The whyche was shortly after shypped at the next ryuer / and so conuayed vnto saynt Germayns de Pree before spoken of / and there wyth greate solēpnyty buryed, when he hadde regned, as before is sayde xxiiii. yeres / leuynge after hym a son before mynded called Clotharius or Lotharius.
                     Thus as affermyth myn authour mayster Robert Gagwyne endyd Chylperych myserably his lyfe / whiche in pryde and mysery before tyme it cōtynued. And where in his lyfe he cherysshed no frende / at hys ende he fande few or no frendes. Thys gaue the patrymony of ye chyrche to lewde &amp; symple clerkys, and was an enmye to all holy relygyous places / and fauored more suche as had lately bene conuerted to the fayth, than he dyd them that had cōtynued by holy lyfe a longe season therin / &amp; gaue vnto such persons the rule of Crystes chyrche. Amonge the whyche, one there was of perfyght lyuyng and byshop of Parys / that garnysshed hys tōbe with this cpytaphy as after in meter foloweth.

                        CAreticus or Lareticus after yt wrytynge of Guydo, of whom nother yt progeny nor yet other addicyon of honour is of wryters of hym remē
                        bred / began to rule the Brytons, the yere of our lord .v. hundred .iiii. score and .vi. as the sayde authour recordyth / and ye .xxii. yere of Chylperyche than kynge of Fraunce / and also the ix. yere of Ceawlmus then kynge of westsaxons. Thys as wytnessyth all wryters was a louer of cyuyle batayle &amp; was worst of all men / so yt he was odible to god and his subiectes, in suche wyse that they excyted the Saxons to warre vpon hym, as testyfyeth Guydo / &amp; chasyd hym from cytye to cytye, &amp; towne to towne, tyll they had berafte hym the most

                         parte of suche lande as hys predeces soure Malgo had holdē before hym.
                     But Polycronycō, Gaufryde and other, adde more there vnto / &amp; sayen yt for as mych as the Saxons knew of the discensyon betwene Careticus and hys Brytons / they in all haste sent into Irelande for the kynge called Gurmundus Affricanꝰ / ye which of some wryters are named two persons, as Gurmūdus and Affricanꝰ. But by the rehersall that Ranulfe monke of Chester maketh in ye .xxiii. chapyter of hys fyrste boke of Polycronycō, it shulde seme, that he shuld be named Gurmundus / the whyche by hys meanynge shulde warre in Brytayne and Fraunce, whyle hys brother Turgecius regned as kyng in Irelande, as in the sayd chapyter is more at lengthe declared. whyche fayd Gurmundus with the strength of ye Saxons, warred so sore agayne the Brytōs / that lastly the sayd Careticus was fayne to take the towne of Kaersegent now called Sichester / &amp; therein besegyd hym wyth hys Brytons by a certeyne of tyme / where by dayly skyrmysshes and assautes he

loste mych of hys people.
                     when Careticus had a season assayed and prouyd the strength of his enemyes / and sawe that they encreasyd, and hys knyghtes lassed &amp; mynysshed: he sodenly lefte that towne / and with a certeyne of Brytons toke ouer Seuarne water, and so into walys then callyd Cābria. whych shuld be after moste accorde of wryters, ye iii. yere of ye reygne of this Careticꝰ.
                     About thys tyme as meaneth Antoninus / the great Gregory then beyuge a monke and after pope, sawe at Rome childyrn of Anglis or Saxons to sell at Rome. And whē he had aryd of them what coūtrey they were of, and it was answered to hym that they were named Anglis / he sayde ye Alleluya shulde be songe in that coū
                        tree, that so fayre chylderne were borne in Alleluya before in the .iiii. score and .viii. chapyter rehersyd / ys there takē after ye exposycyō of saynt Austayne, for ayde and helpe of god. But here it is ment for louynge and praysynge of god / as to hym ye laude and thankes shulde be gyuen vnto, that sendyth to men so fayre frewte. wherfore as after shalbe shewyd the sayd Gregory beynge Pope / sent yt holy man Austayne wyth other, for to preache to the sayde Anglis the fayth of Cryste.
                     Then to retourne to Careticus, whom the Englysh cronycle nameth Cortife. Trouth it is, that after he wyth his Brytons were dryuen into Cambria or walis: yet he lefte not contynually to make reyses and assautes vppon the Saxons nexte to hym adioynaunte.
                     In thys tyme or soone after / ruled Ethelfridus the north Saxons. For as wytnesseth the foresayde authour Guydo / he began the reygne of Deira and Brenicia, in the yere of oure lorde .v.C.lxxx. &amp; .xiii. This is Ethelfridus son of Ethelricus, ye pursued so sore the Brytons, &amp; slewe so great a nomber of ye monkes of the towne of Bangor, as is before rehersyd in the .C. and .ix. chapyter of this worke The whyche dayly warred vpon the Brytons, &amp; the Brytons vpon hym / so y• he destroyed or subuerted myche of Crystes fayth wyth the helpe of ye foresayd Gurmunde thorough Loegria or myddle England / in so mych that the bysshoppes of London and yorke wyth other mynysters of the chyrche, wyth such goodes &amp; relykes as they myght cary, fled into dyuerse countrees / so that theyr chyrchdores were shytte after them, or ellys occupyed in worship of theyr fals goddes
                     Thus the fayth that had endured in Brytayne from the tyme of Luciꝰ fyrst crysten kynge in Brytayne tyll thys daye, nere vppon the season of iiii.C. yeres and odde / was well nere extyncte thorough all the lande.
                     And when ye forenamed Gurmūde had fynysshed hys tyrannye wythin the land of Brytayne / he then sayled into Fraunce, where he was after slayne, as wytnessyth Polycronycō / all be it ye french cronycle speketh nothyng of any such man duryng thys persecucyon, as wytnessyth Guydo.
                     The chyrche or monastery before buylded in Uerolamy nowe called saynte Albanes, was by the sayde myscreauntes beten downe / whyche there was buylded of the Brytōs in the honoure of ye holy prothomartyr saynt Albō, with diuerse many other the whyche are loste out of memory.
                     Duryng also this trouble bytwene the Saxons &amp; Brytōs / the lordshyp or kyngdome of Eest Saxon began to take place as after shalbe shewed.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXIX. CHAPITER.
                     IN thys tyme also after the accorde of moste wryters, as wytnessyth Polycronyca &amp; other, Ethelbertꝰ

reygned in Kent / &amp; by knyghthode and greate myghte bare hym / and behaued hym so victoryously, that he enlarged hys kyngdome to the boundys of Humbyr. In which tyme Gregory, whyche for hys notable dedes was surnamed great / was made pope of Rome. The whych as before is touchyd in the precedynge chapyter / hauynge compassyon that the coūtre from whens so fayre chylderne came as he before had seyne, shulde be inhabyte wyth Pagans or people of mysbyleue / sent into Brytayne that holy man Austayne wyth other of hys bretherne, to preche to the Anglis the fayth of Cryste. But as wytnessyth Antoninus in the .iii. chapyter &amp; .xii. tytle of hys foresayde worke, when Austayn was .iii. dayes iourney gone and passed / suche a sodeyne fere entryd in hym and hys feloushyppe, that they turned agayne. Then Gregory cōforted the sayd cō
                        pany / and sent them wyth letters to the bysshop Arelatensis / wyllynge hym to helpe and ayde Austayne in all that in hym nedyd. The tenoure of whyche letters and other sent to Ethelbert kynge of Kent wyth theyr answeres / are wrytē with other questyons in the regester of Gregory, &amp; in the bokes of Beda and other.
                     Austayne thus comfortyd / sped his iourney, and landed in the Eest syde of Kent in the ile of Thauet wyth .xl. felowes / wherof some were interpretours or such as cowde speke all langages. Nere vnto the place before named where holy Austayne landed stode at those dayes the manoyre or palayes of the sayd kyng Ethelbert / wherof at thys daye appere somme of the ruynous walles, &amp; is called of the inhabytaunces of that ile Rychbourgh. It is apparent betwene the ile &amp; the towne of Sandwych, vpon a myle &amp; a halfe from the sayd towne Eestwarde from Caunterbury. Thē when Austayne was landed, he sent the sayde interpretours vnto Ethelberte / sayenge yt they were sent from Rome for the hele and saluacyon of the kynge &amp; hys realme. The kynge before tyme had herde of the fayth of Cryst / for he hadde to wyfe as sayth Polycronycon a french woman that was cristened / and had receyued hyr vppon condycyon that he shuld suffer hyr to lyue after hyr lawe.
                     Then after a certeyne tyme ye kyng spoke with Austayne / but that was without ye house after the maner of hys lawe. Agayn his comyng he arreryd a baner of ye crucifyx, &amp; sange ye lateny, &amp; preachyd to hym the worde of god. Then ye kyng sayd it is fayre that ye promyse. But for it is to me vncowth &amp; new / I may not so soone assent to you. But for ye be comen so farre for my sake / ye shalbe fayre entreatyd, and haue all thynge yt is to you necessary / &amp; we graunte to you leue to torne of our people whom ye maye. when they had receyued thys cōfort of the kynge / they went wyth processyō to the cytye of Dorobernia or Caūterbury, syngynge Alleluya / where they lad theyr lyues as holy faders dyd in the begynnynge of the chyrch / as in fastyng, prayeng, watchyng, &amp; preachynge of the worde of helth / &amp; sange masses / and crystened such as they cōuertyd in ye Eest syde of the cytie in the old chyrch of saynt Martyne, vnto the tyme yt the kyng was cōuertyd. At length when the kyng had well consyderyd the cōuersacyō &amp; holy lyfe of Austayn and his felowes, he harde them more gladly / and lastly by theyr good exortacyōs and gostly loue, was by them cōuertyd &amp; crystened / in ye yere of our lorde after moste accorde of wryters .v.C. lxxx. &amp; xvi / and the .xxxvi. yere of hys reygne, as affermeth Policronicon.
                     
                        Then he gaue to Austayne a place for his bishoppes see at Cristes chyrche in Dorobernia / and buylded the abbey of saynte Peter and Paule in the eest syde of the sayde cytye / where after Austayne and all the kynges of Kent were buryed / and that place is nowe called saynte Augustyne.
                     In thys whyle Augustyne saylyd into Fraunce to the byshoppe Arelatens̄ / and was of hym sacryd archebyshoppe.
                     when holy Gregory was certyfyed of the good expedycyon of Augustyne / he sent then to him mo helpers as Melytꝰ, Iustꝰ, &amp; Paulinus, with bokes and relykes of holy sayntes / and answeres to saynte Augustynes questyons / that was that all suche goodes as fell to the chyrche shulde be deuyded in foūre ꝑtes / that is to meane the fyrste shuld go to the housholde of the byshoppes house and charge of the same / the seconde to the clergy / the thyrde to the amendemēt of chyrches / the fourth to the relyfe of the poore people and other dedys of mercye.
                     when Austayne hadde baptyzed a great part of the kyngdome of Kent / he after made two archebyshoppes by the cōmaundement of saynte Gregorye, as wytnessyth Polycronicon: that one at London, and that other at porke / and by the helpe of Ethelbert, he assembled and gatheryd together the byshoppes and doctoures of Brytayne, that were before dysperkled. The place of assemble was callyd longe after Austeyns oke, whych is expowned to be Austeyns strēgth, and is in the marche of wykeres and of the westsaxons.
                     In thys place he charged the sayd byshoppes, yt they shulde wyth hym preache the worde of god to the Anglys / and also that they shuld amōg them selfe amende certayne errours then vsyd in the chyrche, and specyally for kepynge of theyr Ester tyde. where agayne the byshoppes of Brytayne helde opynyon, tyll Austayne by hys prayers shewyd there a myracle by a blynde Angle or Saxon. After the whyche myracle shewed / ye sayd byshoppes applyed them to the wyll of Austayne in that cause. But for all this there was of theym that sayd, that they myghte not leue the custome, whych they so longe hadde continued, wythout assent of all such as hadde vsyd the same. Then he gatheryd a synode / to the whyche came seuen byshoppes of Brytons, wyth the wysest mē of that famouse abbey of Bangor, But fyrste they toke coū
                        sayle of an holy man and heremyte / whether they shulde be obedyent to Austayne or not. The heremyte sayd yf ye fynde hym humble or meke, as to Crystes dyscyple belonged / yt then they shulde assent to hym. whych mekenesse they shulde perceyue in hym, yf he at theyr commynge into the synode or councell, arose agayne them. when the sayde byshoppes entred ye sayde synode / Austayne sate styll in the chayre and remouyd not. wherfore they were wroth and dysdaynyd hym, and wolde not obey to hys requestes. Then he sayd to them / syns ye woll not assente to my hestes generally / assent ye to me specyally in thre thynges.
                     The fyrste is, yt ye kepe Ester daye in due fourme and tyme as yt is ordeynyd.
                     The seconde, that ye geue crystendome to the chyldern in the maner yt is vsed in the chyrche of Rome.
                     And the thyrde is, that ye preache vnto the Anglys the word of god, as a fore tymes I haue exhorted you. And all the other deale I shall suffer you to amende and refourme wythin your selfe / but they wold not therof.

of. Then saynt Augustyne sayde vnto them, and warned them by maner of inspyracyon / that syns they wold not receyue peace of theyr bretherne, they shulde of other receyue warre &amp; wreche / the whyche was after put in experyence by Ethelfrydus kynge of Northumberlande.
                     Longe yt were to tell the cyrcumstaūce of the lyfe of this blessyd man, wherfore I passe ouer. Lastly whē he hadde in one daye crystyned .x. thousande of Saxons or Anglys, in the weste ryuer that is called Swale besyde yorke, and knewe that he shuld shortely dye after / he ordeyned a successour named Laurence whyle he lyued / for the state of holy chyrche in Brytayn was as yet but rude &amp; boystous. But in yt doynge he folowed the ensample of Peter that was fyrst pope / whyche made Clement by his lyfe helper and successour. Also this Augustyne made Mellitus bysshop of London and of Eestsaxōs / whych after moste wryters were then newly entred the lande. The ryuer of Thamys departed theym and Kent / and after dyed and was buryed in ye monastery before rehersed, wythoute the wallys of Dorobernia or Caunterburye.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXX. CHAPITER.
                     EThelbertus then confermyd in the fayth / among other costly dedys beganne he foundacyon of Paulys chyrche wythin the cytye of London / and ordeyned yt for the bysshoppes see of London. For the archbyshoppes see that before tyme was at London / was by Augustyne and Ethelbert at the prayer of ye cytezyns of Dorobernia trāslated to the sayde cytye / as in the .lix. chapyter of thys treatyse yt is more at length declared. But of the buyldynge of thys chyrche of saynt Paule, dyuerse opynyons ben. For some wryters testyfye, that yt was buylded or begonne to buylde, by Sygebertus kynge of Eestanglys, but more veryly kynge of Eestsaxōs or Eestsex. This Ethelbert also foūded the chyrche of sayne Andrew, in the cytye of Dorubres in Kent nowe called Rochester / of the whyche Iustus was byshoppe ordeyned before of saynt Albane.
                     About ye tyme or a season after / the forenamed Ethelfrydus, whyche in the englyshe cronycle is named Elfryde / foughte wyth the Brytons at the cytye of Legyscestre or Chestre / &amp; slew of the Brytons a great nomber. At whyche tyme and season, a great nomber of the monkes of Bangor were also there assembled, for to pray for the good spede of the Brytons. wherof when Ethelfrydus was warned / he fell also vppon theym, and flewe of theym at that tyme, as wytnessyth dyuers authours .xxi. hūdred as yt is before shewyd in the .C. and ix. chapyter of this boke.
                     This forenamed Ethelbert excyted a dweller or cytezen of London, to make a chyrche or chapell in the worshyp of saynte Peter, in the west ende of London then called Thorney, and now the towne of westmynster / the whyche that tyme was forgrowen wyth bushes and b

                        eres excedyngly. where the sayde cytezen be ganne, and buylded the fyrst chyrche of westmynster in ye honour of saynt Peter, whych was after by saynt Edwarde the cōfessour enlarged or new buylded. But of the thyrde Henry, when he reygned as kynge of England / yt was newe edyfyed &amp; made as yt now is a beauteous monastery, and rychely endowed bothe wyth possessyon and relykes, and ryche iewellys.
                     It is shewyd in the Englyshe cronycle

of Englande / that thys Ethelbert shulde be slayne in a fyghte betwene hym and Ethelfryde kynge of Northumberlande. But Policronicon sayth that he dyed and went to heuen / when he hadde reygned ouer the lordshyppe of Kent .lvi. yeres / and the .xxi. yere after that he hadde receyuyd Crystendome.

                        DUrynge also the foresayde persecucyon of ye Brytōs, or any ruler of thē were specyally named / beganne the reygne of Eestsaxons as wytnessyth Policronicon, vnder Sebertus theyr fyrste kynge / nere about the yere of our lordes incarnacyon .vi. hundred and .xiiii. All be yt that Guydo de Columna sayth that yt beganne nere about the tyme and season, when the kyngdome of Eestanglys beganne. But I folowe Polycronicon / for he leyeth holy Beda for his Authour in myche of his worke. This kyngdome whych is to meane Essex / hadde in the eest syde the see / in the weste Myddelsex and London / in the southe the cyuer of Thamys / &amp; in the north Suffolke / and endured after moste wryters by the terme of two hundred and odde yeres. But by y• sayeng of Policronica yt shuld not endure ouer two hundred yeres. Neuerthelesse yt shulde appere by the storye of Edwarde the elder sonne of Aluredus, yt yt shulde cōtynue vnder the Danys and other wyse, tyll the .viii. yere of his reygne. And by that reason yt shulde endure two hundred .lxxx. &amp; .xiii. yeres. The contynuaūce therof is more doutfull to be iustly determyned, for so myche as wryters be of dyuers opynyons of the begynnyng therof. All be it ye Polycronycon in the .li. chapyter of hys fyrste boke, sayth that yt began vnder Sebertus, and vnder .x. kynges / tyll Egbertus kynge of westsaxons subdued yt and ioyned yt to his owne kyngedome.
                     The fyrste crysten kynge of thys lordshyppe was the forenamed Sebertus, conuertyd by meanes of Mellitus byshoppe of London, as sayth Guydo. But after hys sayeng thys Sebertus shulde be the thyrd kynge of Essex. All wryters agreen that the kynges of thys lordshyp were more comynly named vnder kynges, and were more subiecte to other kynges / and chefely vnto the kynges of Mercia or Mercheryke.
                     Then to retourne agayn vnto the Brytons, whyche by all this season occupyed a parte of Cornewayl and the countres of Cambria / as Uenedocia, whyche now is called Northwalys, ad Demecea whych now is called Southwalys / and there held them in makynge assautes vpon the Saxons, as before is touchyd, some whyle in one coste, and some whyle in that other, vnder sondrye dukes, as witnessyth Gaufryde and also the englysh cronycle. The whych so contynued after moste accorde of tyme, and to accorde thys hystorye wyth other, by the terme of .xxiiii. yeres / ouer and aboue thre yeres alowed for the reygne of Careticus aforesayd. So that from the fyrste yere of Caretycus, to the laste of these .xxiiii. yeres. / expyryd or flowyd .xxvii. yeres. At whyche tyme the Brytons of one assent chase for theyr hedde or ruler, y• duke of Uenedocia, or Southwalys, named Cadwanus.
                  
                  
                     
                     Francia. THE .CXXII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        CLotharius or Lotharius the sonne of Chilpericus, &amp; second of yt name / was made kynge of a parte of Fraū
                        ce in ye yere of oure lorde .v. hundred lxxx. and .viii / and the .ii. yere of Careticus then kynge of the Brytons. Thys Clotharius by the reporte of mayster Robert Gagwyne, is notyd to be descendyd of Clodoueꝰ Lowis fyrste crystened kynge of Fraunce / &amp; not expressely to be the sonne of Chilpericus.
                     But for so myche as in the cronycle of Chilperych, I haue shewed to you somwhat of the dedys of Fredegund wyfe of Chylperiche: therfore I entende in the declarynge of thys story of Clothayre, to expresse the remanaunte, in as shorte wyse as I goodly may. And fyrst ye shall vnderstād, that after thys fredegunde had as before is shewed, causyd her lorde to be slayne: she ferynge that at length her vntrouth shulde be dyscoueryd / wyth all her goodes in shorte tyme after yode vnto Paris / and there in the monasterye or house of our ladye held her. And for she wold be in more suerty / and also her son the sayd Clotharius shuld be the strēger in his domynyon and kingdome: therfore she sent messengers vnto Gunthranus kynge of Orleaunce &amp; brother to her lorde Chilperich / requyryng hym of fauoure and ayde / &amp; that he wolde of his goodnesse be tutour &amp; defendour of her yonge sonne Clotharius. The whych not denyenge the requeste of Fredegunde, spedde towarde Paris in all haste / where wyth the assent of other nobles of the realme, he toke the gydynge of the yonge kynge. By whose aduyse and cōmaundement, the sayde Clotharius was conueyd &amp; shewyd thorough many of the chefe cytyes of his lande. But in lykewyse as Gunthranus wyth other bysyed theym selfe to strength Lotharius in hys ryghte / euen so were other of the nobles of Fraūce (by the meanes of Brunechyeldis, wyfe some tyme of Sygebert, yongest sonne of Lothayre the fyrst / the whyche Sygebert receyued of hys sayde wyfe two sonnes named Chilperich and Chyldebert / of the whych two, Chilperich suruyued the other) that dyd all theyr entent to promote Chyldebert to the porcyon of hys father / that Chilpericus father of Lotharius occupyed after the deth of Sigebert forenamed.
                     Here dyscordeth the frenche cronycle frō myne authour Gagwyne. For there yt is sayd, ye Brunechield with the other of her assent / wold then by theyr meanes haue p̄ferred a bastard son of the forenamed Sygebert called Theodoricꝰ, to the kyngdome of Fraūce. An other authour sayth that this Theodorich was the son of Childericꝰ afore named, whyche was the sonne of Sygebert.
                     But to folowe mayster Gagwyne / This Childebert whych by ye former sayeng rehersyd in yt .C. and .xiiii. chapiter of this treatyse, was delyueryd from ye handes of Chilperich his vncle, by meanes of the erle of Poytow named Gūdebald: this with a small cōpany came vnto Paris / where of ye cytesēs he was kept out. For ye which soon after he sent a noble man of his named Gillon with other, as ambassadours vnto Gūthranꝰ. And where among other thynges of hym requyred, they axed of him Fredegūd to suffer deth, for y• she had by her subtylty caused to be murdred bothe Sygebert father to theyr kynge, and also

Chilpericus her owne husbande: yt was of him vtterly denyed. Wherfore this sayd Gyllon sayd vnto Gūthranus / syr kynge knowe thou for certayne, synnes thou haste refused this peace to the offeryd of thy neuewe / that the deth of thy brother shall cleu
                           •
                         to thy hedde. wyth these wordes the kynge beynge greatly amoued / commaunded the ambassadours to be putte oute of his court / and when they were in the strete, all fylthe and ordoure to be caste vppon theym as enymytyes.
                     And varyaunces thus kyndelyng betwene these two kinges / Gunthranus soone after sent Fredegunde into Neustria or Normandy / &amp; caused her there to be kepte not farre from ye citye of Roan, whyther to her came many noble men of Fraūce in cōfortynge her, and also mouynge her for the trouble she was in / promysynge to her ayde to the vttermoste of theyr power. But when that Fredegunde apperceyuyd the great fauoure that Brunechyelde stode in, of the nobles of Orleaunce or Fraunce, she enuyenge her welth and honoure, called to her an homycyde &amp; a felon called Holderyche / to whom the sayde Fredegūde pmysyd great treasour, yf he coude by venyme or otherwyse brynge to deth the sayde Brunechieldis. By meane of whych promyse he graūted to brynge her entent about / &amp; shortely after drewe vnto the court of the sayde Brunechyeldis. where he fyll in suche famylyaryte wyth dyuerse of her courte, that he came many seasons to the p̄sence of ye quene. But by what happe I can not saye / lastely he was taken in suspeccyon / and so tormentyd &amp; pyned, that he cō
                        fessyd ye cause of his thyder cōmyng, and by whom he was sent / with all ye other cyrcūstaunce of the matter. After whych cōfessyon so made / he was to betyn &amp; arrayed in moste vyle maner, and so sent agayn to Fredegūd. And when he was comen to her presence, and shewed what tourment he had suffred for her cause: she incontynēt in fulfyllyng of her malycyous purpose / commaunded that his handes and fete shulde be stryken of and so lette go / to the ende that yt shulde be thought that she had not desyred hym to that besynesse. Aboute thys tyme &amp; season arose a yonge mā in a corner of Fraunce / the whych by his subtyle wytte named hym selfe to be the sonne of the fyrst Lotharius, and brother vnto Gunthranꝰ. The which by synystre meanes and crafty, gatte the fauoure of the lordes of Guyan / and by theyr assystence held and occupyed a great parte therof.
                     And after somdele of hys counsay les to Gunthranus by hys espyes disclosyd / this sayde yonge man beyng named Gūdoaldus, sent vnto Gunthranus an ambassade / and requyryd hym to be restoryd to a porcyon of hys faders goodes. Addyng therto that yf he denyed / the sayde Gundoaldus wolde wyth a strong armye repayre out of Gwyan, and get hys ryght wyth strength / &amp; that to bryng about he shulde also haue great ayde of Chyldebert his neuewe aboue named. whan kynge Gunthranus had at leyser herde the message: he in dysdaynyng the same cōmaunded them to be sette vppon horse backes theyr facys towarde the tayle / and so with betynge and vylanye to be dryuen thorough the town. It was not long after that a daye was appoyntyd betwene Gunthranus and Childebert / at whych day both prynces met with great companyes &amp; lordes. And whē they were sette in theyr counsayll / Gunthranꝰ cōmaunded the foresayd messyngers of Gundoaldus to be brought to fore them, &amp; there agayne

to recyte, theyr foresayde message. whych done, he shewyd furthermore that the sayd Gundoalde had before tyme dispoyled the doughter of Chil peryche named Rygonde, of all such rychesse as she wyth her conueyed, when she went towarde Spayne to be maryed / of the whyche some lordes of Childebert were of counsayll. whyche vnto the sayde two prynces was thought trewe / for so myche as the sayde lordes then accusyd, were absent from that great counsayll.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXXIII. CHAPITER.
                     AFter many and great actes concludyd by thys counsayll betwene these two foresayd prynces: Gunthranus in open audyence admytted hys neuewe Chyldebert for his heyre, for so mych as he had none heyre of hys bodye / commyttynge the rule therof to hym before all that were there. And after toke hym aꝑte, and shewyd to hym whych of his nobles he shulde take to counsayll, and whyche he shuld refuse. And specyally he warnyd hym to be well ware of hys moder Brunechyeldis, for that he knewe in her so great vntrouthe &amp; subtylty / and also of Gyllon the bysshoppe, the whyche he also sayde he was not to be trusted. when he had thus aduertysed hys neuewe, they both retourned vnto the place of coū
                        sayll / where by them and theyr counsayllys certayn thynges concernyng the comone wele were sette in an order. And that done, the sayde counsayll was fynyshed / and purueyaūce for theyr dyner pronyded, the prynces wyth theyr baronye went vnto dyner. In the season of whych dyner the sayde Gunthranus sayde vnto ye great nomber of lordes beynge presente / ye my lordes and nobles of Fraunce, the whych to me haue euer more ben true and dere / here is myn neuew, the whyche as myne heyre I haue allowed and ordeynyd, whome I praye you to honoure, and wyth true fayth be vnto hym obedyent as to your kyng. For of ye great worthynesse that of hym is to come, I am in great hope / whyche is allyed wyth myght and vertue. And to the augmentacyon of these wordes / shortely after restored to hym all such cytyes, as Chilpericus by hys lyfe had with holden from hym. And soone after eyther from other in moste humble &amp; louynge maner departyd.
                     Of thys peace betwene these two prynces thus stablysshyd, the fame ranne wyde. wherfore certayne lordes beyng vppon the partye of Gundoaldus refused hym / and went vnto the party of Gunthranus.
                     Soone after wyth hys people Gū
                        doaldus resortyd vnto a cytye ouer the ryuer of Gerounde named Conuena / where for the strength therof, he thought to abyde hys fortune. wherof when Gunthranus was warned / he in goodly spede made thyder warde, and layd hys people nere vnto the sayde cytye. But when he had espyed the strēgth therof / and knew well yt was daungerous for to obteyn: he thē vsyd gyle, where strēgth myghte not preuayle / and deuysed or forged certayn letters in the name of Brunechyeldys, wherin was fayned, that the sayde Brunechyeldys shulde desyre Gundoaldus in all hasty wyse, to resorte vnto the cytye of Burdeaux.
                     Of whyche fraude Gundoaldus no thynge suspectynge / commaundyd hys treasoure wyth other hys stuffe vnder saufe gydynge thyderward to be conueyed. wherof the knightes of Gunthranꝰ hauyng knowlege, with a stronge cōpany made ouer the fore sayd water of Geroūde, &amp; layde such

watche for them, that they encountred the sayde people that caryed the sayde treasure and stuffe / and parforce toke it from the knyghtes of Gundoaldus and presentyd it vnto Gunthranus.
                     Lyke as before ye haue harde that certeyne lordes of the hoste of Gundoalde fled vnto the hoste of Gunthranus / so in thys passe tyme .iiii. capytaynes or rulers of the hoste of Gunthranus fled vnto Gundoalde / yt whych myne authour nameth Desiderius, Mommolus, Bladascus, and Sagyttaryus. whyche .iiii. after theyr comynge to Gundoalde stode in such fauour / that he was by theyr counsayle myche what aduysed and gyded. It was not longe after that ye knyghtes of Gunthranus had thus wonne ye foresayd treasoure &amp; stuffe / that Gundoald was so sore pursued that he was fayne to close hym wyth in a stronge cytye / the whyche Lendegylsus mayster of the hoste of Gū
                        thranus assayled by dyuerse feates of warre to wynne. But whā he saw hys labour lost / than he cautelously fande y• meane to speke secretly with one of the foresayde .iiii. capytaynes named Mommolus, and wyth hym treatyd of the betrayenge of ye cytye. The whyche after many and longe exhortacyons, wyth the assuraūce of theyr lyues and other, graūtyd vnto the sayd treason / whereof the maner shulde be thus. Thys sayd Mommolus wyth the forenamed Bladascus and other of that affynyte / shulde set a fyre an olde temple wythin yt citye. And when the people of ye citye were besyed to quenche the fyre / the sayde Mommolus wyth hys adherentes to open the gates, &amp; so to let in Lyndegylsus and hys knyghtes. But yet thys treason set a parte / Mōmolus goeth to Gōdoalde, and sheweth to hym the greate daunger that he standeth in of his enemyes. wherfore he counsayled hym that he wyth the other rulers about hym go vnto the tentys of Gunthranus and yelde them all vnto hys grace and mercy. And also to the entent that he shuld there shewe and proue, that he was the indubytate son of the fyrste Clothayre / the whyche to the kynge and all his hoste was very doutfull, and the more bycause he so fled from them. whan Gundoaldus had at ley soure harde the counsayle of Mommole, gyuynge to hym credence / for so mych as by hys counsayle before tymes he had fortheryd hys causes / and also by comfort that he reportyd to haue by meanes of Lyndegylsus before named: he settyng a parte all fere, wyth certayne nomber in peasyble wyse issued the cytye. And whan he had a lyttell space gone: ii. erles of Gunthranus hoste named Bole and Boson receyued hym, and delyuered hym to the power of Lyndegylsus / and Mommole retourned wyth the other of his confederey, vnto ye citye / and closed faste the gates bytwene ye citye and the pauyllyons of Gūthranus. where was a lytell coppyd hyll / to the heyght whereof whan Gundoalde was comen, the sayd Bosō hym sodeynly threwe downe. And as he was rollynge downe the hyll / with a great stone he strake him on the hed, by vyolēce wherof he was forthwith slayne or dede. And Mommole, the whych as before is towched was reentred the citye / fyrste dyspoyled the goodes of the sayd Gundoalde / and after fell vpon the citesyns, and robbed and spoyled them in lyke maner, not sparynge prestes nor other / and after brente chyrches, temples, and houses without pytye / whyche done he sped hym vnto the tentys of Lyndegylsus. But he not beynge sure of the sauegarde of the sayde Mōmole

and hys cōpany from the murmoure of hys knyghtes / or more veryly for he wolde not be a knowen of the prouyded deth of theym / commaunded the sayde Mōmole wyth hys adherentes to tary without, &amp; not to come in the prese of hys knyghtes, tyll he had somedele pacyfyed them. whiche was done, but not all without strife / for some there were that beganne to quarell wyth hym and hys. But whē Lyndegylse sawe that this Mōmole and his company were somdele withdrawē frō his pauylyon, he made a token to hys knyghtes / whereby they knowyng his mynde, fell vpon him &amp; slewe hym. Sagyttarius one of the foresayde .iiii. of that company, the whyche myne authour reporteth to be a byshoppe, fledde to haue sauegarded hym self / but in his flyght he was slayne. And whē these enymyes where thus brought out of lyfe / Gunthranus commaūded the goodes of the sayde Mommole to be broughte vnto hys tresorye / whyche were of great valure, and after were egallye deuyded betwene hym and Childebert hys neuewe. It was not longe after but certayne tokens &amp; fygures appered in the fyrmament, the which by astronomers were iuged the fyne of some prynce / whyche after a yere shewyd to be true. For the sayd Gunthranus dyed vpon a yere folowyng the sayd fygures or sygnes / when he hadde ben kyng of Orleaunce by the terme of .xxxvii. yeres / and was buryed wyth great pompe in the cytye of Cabylon wythin the prouynce of Burgoyne, in ye monastery of saynte Marke, whyche he before had buylded / and lefte for hys heyre of that kyngdome his neuewe the foresayde Chyldebert.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXXIIII. CHAPITER.
                     CHildebertus then hauyng the rule &amp; possessyon of hys owne enherytaunce, that ys to saye of Austracy, and also of Orleaunce / castynge in his mynde howe he myghte be reuenged of Fredegunde, ye which as before is shewed in the .C. &amp; .xiii. chapyter of this lybell slewe hys father Sygebert: called vnto hym his olde frende and councelloure Gundebald erle of Poytowe / and then cō
                        maunded yt he shuld with his power inuade the countre of Soysons, the whyche was in the rule of Clotharius. wherof Fredegunde beyng warned / assembled to her ye lordes of the countrey, and exhorted them to wythstande the malyce of theyr enymyes / shewynge to them furthermore that that thynge they shuld of iustyce and equyte do, consyderynge that theyr kynge Clotharius was yet tender of age, and hadde as yet no knyghtely prowesse to defende hym self and his lande. And after a longe exhortacyon to them made / she wyth her sonne prepared to go agayne the sayde enymyes. And when all thynge to the warre was preparyd and redy / she wyth a great army made toward the hoste of Gundebalde. And when she knewe she was nere vnto the hoste / she commaundyd her captaynes to reste &amp; fortyfye her people vppon all ꝑtes for brekyng in of her enymyes. And agayne nyghte she called to her Laundry her olde paramoure wyth other / wyllyng them that in the dede of the nyght they wolde manfully set vppon the other partye / for so myche as she sayde to them that she was certaynly enfourmed by her espies, that her sayde enymyes were sore weryed by reason of that dayes laboure. After whose counseyll the sayde Laundry wyth other wrought / and supprysed theyr enymyes so vnwarelye, that of theym she slewe a parte &amp; chasyd the remanaunt. And that done spedde them vnto Champayne nere

vnto Reynes, and spoyled and brent a parte of that countre. Thys feat of warre thus compassyd by the subtyle wytte of Fredegunde was nere to a place called Truet.
                     Then Childebert entendyd after certentye hadde of the ouerthrowe of Gundebalde, for to haue made newe warre vppon Fredegunde. But he was let by meane of the Longobardis, whyche than made warre vpon hym. Of the whyche warre he hadde somdeale his entent / and more shuld yf Mauricius emperour of Constā
                        tyne the noble had kept all promesse with hym before made. After ye which warre in party endyd, he retourned into hys owne countree / and shortly after he and also hys wyfe dyed, and not wythout suspeccyon of venym / leuyng after hym two sōnes named Theodobert and Theodorych / gyuynge to the eldest the lordshyppe of Austraci, and to the yonger the prouynce of Burgoyne.
                     About thys tyme the Hunes brake out of theyr places, and warryd vpō certeyne partyes of myddle Fraunce and dyd therein greate harme. But lastly by meanes of greate gyftes by them receyued / they left the countre &amp; drewe towarde Soysons. Agayne whom Fredegūde gaderyng a grete powar / sent Clotharius hyr sonne &amp; kynge, to the entent to defende the sayd Hunes / that they shulde not inuade theyr countrees. And shortly after bothe hostes mette in the felde / where after longe and sharpe fyght the Frenchmen were vyctours, and chased the Hunes in suche wyse, that the more parte of them were slayne and taken, for the whyche vyctory Fredegunde made excedynge ioye to hyr son Clothayre / &amp; receyued hym with greate pleasure, and excedynge gyftes. After the whyche passyd not longe whyle, but that she fell syke &amp; dyed / and than buryed by hyr housbonde Chylperich.
                     whan the forenamed bretherne had knowlege of the deth of Fredegūde / they by the exhortacyon and styryng of Brunechieldis theyr graundmother, callyng to mynde the wronges to theyr auncesters done by Fredegund, and somdele by Lothayre: assembled a greate powar, &amp; met wyth Lothayre and hys powar at the ryuer of Arrune or Aruēne. In ye which place was so sore fyght and so many slayne, that the cource of the ryuer was let, by the multytude of the caryens or dede bodyes yt were therein caste. But the more parte fell of the knyghtes of Lothayre / so yt he was forcyd to forsake the feld, and thens to flee to the cyty of Meleon, &amp; from thens to Parys: whom the sayde bretherne folowed / &amp; compelled hym to make peas after theyr pleasure. The effecte of which peas was this. Theodobert ye elder brother of these two, shuld enioye all the lande lyeng bytwene the ryuer of Seyn &amp; Leyr, vnto the Bryttysh Occean, or the see of lytell Brytayne. And Theodorich the yonger brother, to haue all the lande from the sayd ryuer of Seyn vnto the ryuer of Isayr to the brynk of the see. And to Clothayr shuld remayne .xii. prouinces, which the sayd two ryuers of Isayr and Seyne flowen by or thorough.
                     whyche peas thus confermed and graūted / Theodobert to whom Neustria or Normandye belonged, sent thyder a cheuetayne of hys court called Berthalde, to defende the sayde countre. But Clothayre of thys former accorde beynge nothynge contentyd / sent his sonne Meroneꝰ vnder the gydynge of Laundry prefect or ruler of hys paleys into Neustria to warre in that countrey. And for so mych as Berthalde sawe

well he lakked power to wythstande so great an host / he therfore toke the cytye of Orleaunce, tyll he had gaderyd more company. Then Laundry seasyd that parte of ye coūtrey, &amp; cam to the wallys of the cytye / and by dyuerse wordes of reproche, excyted ye sayde Berthalde to gyue batayll to hym in the playne felde. The whych he refusyd because of the inequalyte of nomber of knyghtes. But he offeryd to issue out of ye cytye, &amp; to fyght wyth Laundry hande to hand / wyth that he myght be assuryd agayne his people / the whyche offer Laundrye refusyd.
                     It was not longe after or bothe kynges wyth great hostes drewe into that countrey / and at the ryuer of Stampis mette, where betwene thē was foughten a stronge batayll. But by the polycye of Theodobert / Lothary was putte to a disuaūtage. For whyle the sayde Lotharye was cōueyeng hys people ouer the ryuer at a narowe passage / Theodobert beganne so fyersly and kepte the passage so streyt, that the peple of Clotharye came not two partes of theym to the felde. Neuerthelesse the fyght cō
                        tynued by a longe season / in whyche tyme Berthalde encountred many tymes Laundrye, and prouoked hym to batayll / but euer that other refusyd. Lastly he seynge and knowyng well that he shuld wynne great worsshyppe and also profyte, yf he myght slee or take this Laūdry / he therfore put hym selfe in the more daunger of hys enymys, and fynally of thē was slayn. But Theodobert in pursuyng Lotharye and in comfortynge of his knyghtes bare hym so well, that he causyd his enimyes to lese grounde / and at length put them to flyght, the whyche he foloweth to the gates of Parys, to the great damage of ye people of Lothary. In this chase was taken Meroneus the sonne of Clotharye wyth many other / but Laundry was goten wythin the cytye. And when Theodobert had thus goten the vyctory of hys enemyes / he lyste no lenger to tary about them at that season / but shortly after retourned to hys countre.
                     In the court of Theodorich broder of this Theodobert, was at this day dwellynge an Italian named Prothadiꝰ / the whyche as myne authour sayth was paramour vnto Brunechyeld before sayd. The which, Brunechyeld by hyr meanes had exalted from poore estate vnto hyghe authoryte / the whyche was of a subtyle &amp; far castynge wytte, and therwyth excedynge couetous / and in greate fauour of the kynge, but to all hys lordes odyous &amp; hatefull: for the which vnlefull meanes by hym to the nobles and comons of the lande vsed / &amp; for the yll condycyons and bad counceyll that Brunechyelde &amp; thys Prothadiꝰ vsed within ye court of Theodobert / he bannysshed them both as well of hys lande as of hys courte. wherfore euer after they malygned agayne Theodobert. And for the execucyon of theyr malicious purpose / they tolde vnto Theodoryche, that hys enemy and not brother Theodobert, had wythdrawen from hym the chefe of hys faders treasoure / alledgyng also, that he was not the sonne of Chyldebert hys fader, but gotten of a gardener / and wyllyd hym therfore to sende vnto hym and to aske restytucyon of the sayde goodes. By the whyche wycked counceyle Theodoryche was so lad, that he sent vnto hys brother / and in suche wyse so vexyd and styryd hym, that dedely malice was kyndelyd betwene them. In so myche that eyther of them assembled great hostes / and lastely met nere vnto a towne named Carysse.

where the sayde hostes beynge redy to haue runne togyders / the lordes of Theodoberte so demeaned them vnto hym, that by theyr wyse counsayle he agreed to sende to hys brother, and to haue a cōmunicacyon of peas. And whan the embassade was comen to the pauylyon of Theodoryche, and there had shewyd the vnkyndnesse of thys warre, wyth the ieopardy that myghte ensue of the same / anone the foresayde Prothadius toke vppon hym the answere, &amp; sayd: it is not requysyte so lyghtly to graunte peas / but necessary it is to attempte the wyll of our enemye by batayle, whether he woll be agreable to condescende to our desyres. The whyche wordes thus expressyd of hym, anone the more party of the lordes dysdayned it / and conspyryd wythin them selfe howe they myghte putte hym to deth. And forthwyth arose amonge them such a murmur, that ye kynge apperceyued well that they entendyd some harme to Prothadius. For the whyche he called vnto hym a knyght named Uselyne / chargynge hym to go vnto the lordes, commaundynge them that they in no wyse shulde do any harme to Prothadius. The whyche Uselyne beynge of the mynde of the other / sayd that the kynge wolde that they shulde slee Prothayde. After whyche message done / they ranne in all haste and hym slewe, as he sate playenge at dyce or tables wyth one Peter a physicyon / and that done all hoolly ranne vnto ye kynges tent, besechyng hym to take no dyspleasure of ye deth of so euyll a man, that as well was knowē, was enemye to all frendshyp and peas. But for Theodoryche apperceyued well, that he cowde not reuenge hys deth wythout ponyshemēt of a multytude / he therfore toke pacience, and suffred the offence to passe vnpunysshed. After whyche man thus murdered / bothe prynces without notable acte deꝑted eyther into hys countree.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXXV. CHAPITER
                     TO thys daye Theodoryche had taken no wyfe / all be yt of hys concubyne he receyued two sonnes. He therfore by thaduertysement of hys frendes, set hys mynde to mary some noble woman / &amp; soone after sent certeyne ambassadours vnto Berthricꝰ then kyng of Spayne / wyllyng to graūte vnto hym Memberge his doughter in mariage. The whiche vppon certeyne condicyons was perfourmed, and wyth greate ryches to hym shortly after sent and maryed / 
                           •
                         by a certayn tyme well entreated &amp; cheryshed. But that season rōne &amp; spent / Brunechyeld so turned the kynges mynde from the quene, that lastely he wyth suche treasoure and iewellys as he of her receyued, sent her home agayn. The whych iniury Berthricus her father toke at herte greuously / &amp; shortly after sente hys messengers vnto Clothary kyng of Soysons, requiryng hym of ayde to warre vppon Theodoriche, which hadde done vnto hym great dyspleasure / and the rather for ye warre that the sayde Theodoryche wyth his brother lately made agayne hym / the whyche wyth both theyr strengthes they myghte then well reuenge. To whome Clotharius graūted. And to haue hys party the stronger, he sente vnto hys neuewe Theodobert and brother to Theodoriche, to styre hym agayne hys sayde brother.
                     wherof when Berthricus hadde receyuyd knowlege of hys sayde messengers / he thē sent vnto Agon king of Longobardys / or more veryly Adoaldus the .v. kynge after Alboynus / requyryng hym in lyke maner.

And he desyrous of wreche / made faste and sure promyse to gyue ayde to the vttermoste of his power.
                     when Theodoryche was warned of the cōspyracy of these .iiii. kynges, that entendyd to warre ioyntly vppon hym / he was therwyth greatly amoued, and prouyded for hys defence in his best
                           •
                         maner. Then Theodobert trustyng the appoyntmēt before made, assembled a great hoste / and made spede fyrst toward ye place bytwene theym appoynted, whyche was nere to ye castell of Salas. But or any preparacyon was made towarde batayle / a meane was founde that the forenamed two bretherne shulde mete eyther wyth other, accō
                        panyed wyth .x. thousand knyghtes. But Theodobertus enter

                        ynge to dysceyue hys sayd brother, &amp; to force hym to graūte to his pleasure / broughte wyth hym ferre aboue ye nōber. wherfore Theodoricus beynge ouersette wyth strength / graunted all his brothers wyll. whych was that ouer certeyne thynges and appoyntementes concluded bytwene Berthricus and hym / Theodobert shulde holde to hym and his heyres two lordshippes called Champayne and Turon. whych conclusyon fynysshed / eyther takynge leue of other departyd vnto theyr countreys / but not wythout greate vnrestfulnesse of the sayde Theodorych, berynge in mynde the wronge doynge of hys brother. wherfore he shortly after made meanes to hys neuewe Clothayre desyrynge hym that he wolde not assyste hys brother agayne hym / but to suffer hys quarell to be demyd by dynt of swerde bytwene theym two. This requeste, Lothayre by the aduyse of saynte Columbane munke of Irelande than beynge in those costes, graunted.
                     And the french cronicle sayth, that he was warned of thys foresayd holy munke and abbot, that he shulde not medle bytwene the sayd two bretherne / for so myche as yt was prouyded of god, that he shuld be heyre to them bothe.
                     whan Theodorych had receyued thys answere, he gaderyd his strēgth and spedde hym vppon hys iourney to the cytye of Langresse, and from thens to Uerdune or Uerdoune. Theodoberte hauynge knowlege of hys malycyouse brothers purpose, gaderyd in Austracy a greate hoste / and so sped hym tyll he came to the cytye of Toull. where bothe hostes shortely after met / and in the feldes or playnes nere to the cytye foughte a stronge batayle. In the which was slayne greate people vppon bothe sydes / but the more parte vppon the syde of Theodobert. wherfore he fynally was compelled to forsake the felde, and fled vnto Coleyne. where he gaderyng a newe powar / fought agayne wyth hys brother. In the whyche fyght he had lyke fortune / &amp; was agayn chasyd to hys grete shame and losse / whom Theodoricus as hys mortall enemye folowed, fyrynge and wastynge the countreys as he went / in so myche that the inhabytauntes of the coūtreys fell before hym, besechynge his grace, that for the offence of one man, he wolde not destroye so many innocentes / assurynge hym forthermore that they wolde become hys lyegemen, and holde theyr lande of hym for euer. At whyche request he sayde gladly he wolde to them graunte theyr petycyon, yf that they wolde presente to hym the hedde of hys brother. After the whych answere by them of Theodorych receyued / they amonge them selfe appoynted out a certayne of persones moste apte to theyr purpose / and wyllyd theym to go vnto

Theodobert to execute theyr entent. The whyche sped theyr iourney tyll they came to the presence of Theodobert / &amp; shewyd vnto hym that yf he wolde be agreable to departe wyth suche stuffe and iewellys as he had of hys faders, so that Theodoryche myghte be partener therof / he shulde haue perfyght amyte and rest wyth hym. To the whyche wordes he gyuynge confydence and truste / called wyth hym the sayde persones / and brought them into ye howses, where the sayd stuffe and iewellys lay. And whyle he was busyed to deuyde out and appoynte ye porcyon of hys, one of the sayde persons slewe hym sodeynly / and after of one agrement strake of hys hed, and in secrete wyse caused yt to be conueyed vnto hys brother. whan Theodoryche hadde receyued the hed of hys brother, he sped hym to Coleyne where this treason was wrought / and receyued the cytye into hys possessyon, wyth all ye kyngdome of Austracy to hys brother belongynge. And when he had there ordred hys nedes after hys mynde / wyth two sonnes and an excedynge fayre doughter of Theodobert, he spedde hym vnto Mees the chefe cytye of Austracy / where wyth hym met hys graundmoder Brunechyelde. The whyche perseuerynge in all malyce and myschefe / caused ye sayd two sonnes to be shortly slayn.
                     Theodorych then restoryd or delyuered vnto Clothayre, all such lādes as to hym he had before promysed.
                     Theodoryche thus endynge hys warre, the whyche by a longe season spent hys tyme in kepynge of concubynes / was nowe rauyshed wyth the beaute of his brothers doughter, the whyche he hadde brought from Coleyne. But that doyng Brunechyeld wythstode wyth all her power, because the mayde was so

For the whych he beyng with herfore dyscōtent sayde, o thou most wycked &amp; false woman / dyd not thou make me to beleue, that Theodobert was not the sonne of my father / but that he was the sonne of a gardyner. For what cause hast thou caused me to ꝑsecute my brother, and lastely to

                     THE .CXXVI. CHAPITER.
                     NOw that I haue shewed vnto you the fyne &amp; ende of these two bretherne / by reason of whose deth the hole pryncypate of Fraunce fell vnto the abouenamed Clothayr: I shall now expresse vnto you the dedys by hym done after he hadde all the rule onely.
                     So yt was that ye forenamed Brunechyelde malygned euer agayn Lothayr. And to the fortheraūce of her malyce▪ she behauyd her in such wise wyth some of the rulers &amp; lordes of Austracy, that she caused them to admytte owne named Sygebert to be ryghtfull enherytoure of that lande▪ But for that some of them had good experyence of theyll dysposycyon of this woman / they therfore sent two noblemen of that lande name Pepyn

and Arnold vnto Clothayre / willynge hym to sende hastely into that prouynce. After the whyche message by these two lordes reported, Clotharius shortely after spedde hym into Austracy / and at a castell called Cathomat he lodgyd hym with hys people. whereof herynge Brunechielde sent vnto hym / &amp; gaue vnto hym monicyon that he shuld voyde the land, for so myche as Sygebert the eldest sonne of Theodoryche was therof ryghtefull enherytour.
                     ye haue harde before that Theodoryche vsyd lemmans / of the whyche he receyued foure sonnes, yt is to say Sygebert, Corbe, Chyldebert, and Merone. wherfore ye foresayde Brunechyelde entendynge to dystourbe Lothayre and all the lande / fortyfyed the sayd Sygebert to clayme the lande of Austracye. And when Clothayre hadde receyued knowlege of this maundemēt from Brunechielde or Bruncheuste / he sent to her answere that he wolde assemble the lordes of Austracy, and be demed by theym, whyther thys land belonged to hym, or Sygebert. And she ferynge that sentence / excyted people of the prouynce of Germanye to strength her partye, wyth all the people that she myght make of the sayde countre of Austracy. And that to bryng about / she sente one Garnery an other Albon. Of this Garnery she hadde suspeccyon that he shuld fauour ye partye of Lothayre / wherfore to Albone hys felowe she sente letters, that he shulde put the sayde Garnery away. whē Albone had ouer rad the letter / he brake yt in peces &amp; threwe theym from hym. And afterwarde a frende of Garneryes gaderyd the peces / and so ioyned theym that he conceyuyd the sentence of the letter, and forthwyth shewyd yt vnto Garnery. when Garnery perceyued the malycyous entent of Brunechielde, he kepte yt secrete to hym selfe: all be it that he by his secrete meanes caused the Germanyes that they shuld take no partye wyth Brunechyelde. And that done he retourned into Burgoyne / where wyth her and in her cō
                        panye he solycyted so the lordes of Burgoyne, that some of them abhorred the crudelite of that woman. And when Garnery hadde in thys wyse compassed hys maters / he sent vnto Lothayr, &amp; shewyd that yf he myght haue hys grace and safecondute / he wolde come to hym and shew to hym thynges concernynge hys aduauntage. All the whyche was graunted.
                     Then Clothayre by counsayle of ye sayd Garnery assembled his power / &amp; shortly sente a strenght of theym in to Champayne and Cathaloyne / where yt was shewed that Sigebert hadde gatheryd great strenghtys. Then forsoke the party of Sigebert many nobles of Austracye / amonge the whyche myne authoure nameth Rucco, Sigoldus, and Enulanus, and yelded them to the mercy of Clothayre. Then shortly after the hostes of Clothayre and Sygebert mette / where Garnerye, by tokens betwene hym and dyuerse of the captaynes of Sygebert before assygned, ye sayd captaynes wyth theyr people wythdrewe them, so that Sygebert wyth hys two bretherne Corbo and Meroneus gaue backe whyle they came to the ryuer of Sigoune / where after lytle resystence the foresayde two bretherne were taken. But the frenche cronicle sayth that all foure brethern were there taken. All be yt mayster Gagwyn sayth, that Sygeberte by the vertue of hys horse escapyd / so that he was not after that daye seen.
                     And soone after thys victory Brunechyeldes, which also of the frenche cronycle ys named Bruneheuste / 

was broughte as prysoner vnto the presence of Lothayre, wyth a suster of Theodoryche, whych Garnery or Gerney hadde taken in the tentes of his enymyes. Then Lotharius forthwyth commaūded Corbon to be behedded / and preseruyd Meroneus, for so mych as he was to hym godfather / and euer after cheryshed hym as his kynnesman.
                     Lotharius thus hauyng ye victory of his enimyes, made great ioy. And after he hadde somedeale sette that countrey and other in quyete / he then toke aduyse of hys lordes howe he shulde be demeaned wyth Brunechielde, that hadde ben authoryce of so manyfolde mychyefes and crymynous dedꝭ. The whych of one cōsent and mynde condescendyd &amp; agreed, that she shuld be put to moste paynfull and vyle deth. And fynally after fore betynges she was sette vppon a horse / and so conueyed thorough the hoste / that all men myghte beholde and se her / and after brought agayn to ye kynges presence. where then the kynge rehersed vnto her a longe processe of all her murdurs, conspyracis, and wycked dedes / affermynge that she hadde ben the occasyon and cause of the deth of .x. prynces, besyde other meane persones. And whē he hadde sayde hys pleasure / he then commaunded her to be bounden to a wylde horse tayle by the here of her hedde / and so to be drawen whyle she were dede.
                     And when this iudgement was executed / she by the lycence of the kynge was buryed in an house of relygyon wythin the cytye of Hosdon̄ or Osdon̄, that she before tyme hadde buyldyd in the honoure of saynte Martyne, besyde other many that she in her lyfe buyldyd in dyuerse other places, endowyng them wyth great and ryche possessyons.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXXVII. CHAPITER.
                     THus dame Fortune fauoured the partye of Lotharius / that this kyngdome, whyche hadde from the tyme of Clodoueus Lewes cōtynued vnder .iiii. gouernours or rulers for the more partye, nowe was fallen to hym / so that he hadde all vnder obeysaunce and rule / then anon thys Lotharius made Garnery prefecte and mayster of hys paleys / and releasyd vnto the Longebardes or Lombardes a trybute of .xii. thousand pounde yerely payde to the kynges of Frannce / the whych was fyrst sette vppon theym by Gunthranus hys vncle.
                     And in thys whyle to hys more encreace of wordely ioye / he receyuyd of hys wyfe Bergeruda a sonne, the whych he named Dagobertus. The whyche when he came to couenable age / he betoke to the lore of Arnolde then byshoppe of Me

And when the fyrste wyfe of Lotharius was ded / he maryed a seconde named Sichilde, of whom he receyued a chyld and named yt Haybert. when Dagobert the fyrste sonne was comen to a lawfull age / after vsuell custome of all prynces of Fraunce, he gaue hym myche to the chase of wylde bestys. And as by chaunce one daye he folowed the chace of an hert / and tryed yt so sore yt he broughte hym to a bay in a place that then was called the strete of Catulyen. In the whyche strete was then an old lytle chapell / to the whyche the forsayde herte entred, and there helde hym / all be yt that a great nomber of houndes folowed hym to ye chapell dore, &amp; none of theym wold enter, but there stode bayenge. And when Dagobertus came after and behelde the maner of the houndes, and dyd what he coude to cause them to entre the chapel and

                           •••
                        lynge in hys mynde.
                     It was not longe after, that Clothayr cōsyderynge the frowardnesse of growyng in his sonne Dagobert / assygned to hym a tutour or lerner of worldely and knyghtely maners, whose name was Sadragesyle. And for his sonne shulde haue hym in the more awe and fere / the kyng gaue vnto the sayde tutoure the dukedome of Guyan. But so yt was one daye that for a cause thys Sadragesyle wold haue chastyzed this Dagobert / wherof he beyng ware, associated vnto hym certayne wanton persones and bete his mayster / &amp; after in way of dyspyte caused the berd of hys tutour to be shauen of. For the whyche dede Lothayre was agayne hym greuously dyspleasyd / &amp; in greatire and haste, sente for hys sonne Dagobert. But he feryng punyshement, wythdrewe hym, and went vnto the forenamed chapell / trustyng veryly that wheretofore a beste was shewid such comforte, that he by holy prayers shulde there be comforted tyll suche tyme as he myghte atteyne vnto the grace of hys father.
                     ye shall vnderstande that before tyme after he hadde experyence of that wonder shewyd by the herte / he lerned that the holy martyrs saynte Denys, and hys two felowes Rusticus and Eleutherius shulde be buryed wythin the sayde chapell / the whych were martyryd in the persecucyon of Domycyane the emperour, aboute the yere of Crystes incarnacyon .lxxx. and .xvi. In the honoure of ye whych martyrs the foresayd poore chapell was arreryd, as witnessyth the frenche cronycel, by the meanes of a deuout french man whose name ys not expressyd. Thus Dagobert in thys chapell abydynge in prayer / in the fyrste nyght he beyng in slepe, apperyd vnto hym .iii. olde faders, sayenge vnto hym / yonge man we be those martyrs, whyche many yeres passyd were slayne for the fayth of Cryste, and buryed in thys place by Catula that good woman. whyche place is not duely nor suffyciently honoured / nor yet the people of Fraūce hath not vs in due reuerēce and worshyppe. And therfore when thou art of myghte and power, then remembre vs, and helpe thys place to be otherwyse buyldyd / whych shall not be longe to. And for thou shalte not take thys for a dreme or fantasye / dygge hereafter thys grounde, and thou shalte fynde oure thre bodyes hole and vncorrupt / and vppon eueryche of vs our names with letters fresshely wryten. And after thys they vanyshed awaye.
                     when Dagobert awoke / he called well to mynde thys vysyon. And promysed inwardely betwene god and hym, that yf he were recouncylyd to hys father as to hym they hadde promysed / he wolde fulfyll that they hadde desyryd. After thys the father beynge warnyd that Dagobert was in thys chapell / sent vnto the place certayne of hys knyghtes to pull or take hym thens per force. And when they came wythin a myle of ye sayde chapell / they were so astonyed that they myghte not go one fote forwarde to do the beste they coude.
                     when they hadde long stryuē with oute preuaylynge / they retournyd to the kynge, and shewed to hym ye trouthe in all thynge as they had done.
                     The kynge beynge dyscontent wyth theyr reporte, blamed theym, and sayde that they feryd hys sonne, for the whyche cause they hadde fayned that excuse.
                     
                        And incontynently he sente forth an other company / the which were delte wyth in lyke maner as ye other. were Lothariꝰ somdele troubled wyth the reporte of his seruauntes / consyderyd the chapell to be nere vnto Paris where he then lay / &amp; cōmaundyd his horse to be brought, for he wolde proue the mater hym selfe. But lyke as his seruauntes were seruyd, euen so became of hym / so that he myghte go or ryde frowarde or sydewarde / but towarde the chapell myght he in no wyse atteyne.
                     when this was knowen to ye kyng / he cōsydered well yt was the handyworke of god. wherfore by fayre and easy meanes he called home his son, and recouncylyd hym, and forgaue all trespace. To this accordyth the legende of the lyfe of saynte Denys, wyth more that shall after folowe in the storye of this Dagobert.
                     After thys reconcylyacyon, Lotharius ordeyned vnder hym hys sonne Dagobert to be ruler of the sygnory of Austracye. But whyther yt were by the elacyon of hys owne mynde, or by badde counsayll, he shortely after rebellyd agayne hys father / and wolde haue reteyned that prouynce to his owne vse.
                     For thys were chosen .xii. noble men of Fraūce, to arbytre and deme betwene the father and the son. The whyche Lordes after they had longe debated this mater / by fayre entreatyse contentyd so the father, that he gaue vnto the sonne the sayde lordshyppe of Austracy.
                     Soone after thys accorde, Clothayre made warre vppon the Gothis or Saxons / and them at length subdued. For yt is to be knowē, that lyke as the sayde Saxons inuadyd myche Brytayne or Englande / in lykewyse warryd they in Fraunce / and lastely subdued the prouynce of Neustria and named yt after theym Normandye, as after in the storye of Charlis the symple shall more euydently appere.
                     Of thys vyctorye of Saxons ys made a longe rehersayll / and howe lastly when Clothayre hadde slayne the kynge or ruler of theym named Berthrande, he after yode into the countrey of Germanye, and slewe man and chylde that passyd ye length of hys swerde.
                     Of this and other dedes by this Lothayre done, I myght make a longe worke / but I passe ouer.
                     Then yt foloweth, when Lothayre hadde set his countrey in some reste / he assembled hys lordes at a cytye or towne called Traacas or Trecas. And after dyuers maters dyscussyd and endyd / he axed of theym perfyte allegeaunce and fydelite to hym and hys heyres to be kepte. The wyche by the sayde lordes fyrmely promysed and assuryd / he commaundyd eueryche of theym to repayre to theyr owne countreys. And soone after he made an assemble of hys byshoppes and spyrytuall men at the cytye or towne of Troys / by whose counsayllys he orderyd thynges and maters concernynge the wele of the chyrche. And shortly after he was vexyd with greuous sekenes / wherof he fynally dyed, when he hadde reygned after moste wryters .xliii. yeres, leuynge for heyre the forenamed Dagobert / the whyche enterryd hys fader wyth great pōpe at the abbey of saynt Uincent wythoute the wallys of Paris / the whiche abbey is at thys daye called saynte Germaynes.
                     The foresayde yeres accomptyd for the reygne of Lothayre / be accomptyd from the fyrste daye that he was ordeyned kynge of Soysons, vnto the daye of hys deth. wherof he reygnyd after some wryters ouer a

                     Anglia. THE .CXXVIII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        CAdwanus or Cadwan, the whyche of Guydo ys named duke of Uenedoyce or of Northwalys / was by one assente of the Britōs lastly made theyr souerayne or gouernour, in the yere of our lorde .vi. hundred and xiii / and the .xxv. yere of the seconde Clothayre kynge of Fraunce / and also the fyrst yere of Colwolphus then kynge of westsoxons / accomptynge for the reygne of Ceawlmus kynge of the sayde westsaxons .xxxi. yeres. And for Colricus nexte succedynge hym .v. yeres.
                     ye haue before hard what dyscorde and trouble was amonge the Brytons in the tyme of Careticus laste kynge &amp; longe after, by reason wher of the Saxōs wanne the more land / and as before is rehersyd in the .C. and .xx. chapyter, howe Ethelfryde kynge of Northumberlande ouer set the Brytons at the cytye of Chestre / &amp; forcyd thē to take ouer Seuarne, and so into walys / where they then chase thys Eadwane to theyr duke and leder. The whyche after he was putte in authoryte / assembled hys Brytons, and came agayne into Britayne / and gaue batayll vnto the sayde Ethelfryde. In the whych they spedde dyuersly, so that some season the Saxons wanne / and some while the Brytons. But the Brytons held Chestre &amp; other good townes / whych they hadde recoueryd sene theyr last commynge.
                     It shulde seme by the meanynge of Policronica, that thys Cadwan or Cedwall shulde at length slee the sayde Ethelfryde and Osricus bothe kynges of Brennicia and Deyra. But Guydo and also Gaufryde wytnessen, that after thys Cadwan had the better of Ethelfryde / by medyatours yt was agreed that Ethelfryd shulde enioye all the lande ouer and beyonde Humber vnto Scotlande / and Cadwan shulde haue the lande from Humber towarde the sowthe. To the whyche sayenge agreeth the englyshe cronycle, affermynge also that he shulde be the sonne of Brucyuall kynge of Leyceter, the whych of other wryters is not testyfyed.
                     It is also there shewed that after ye sayde accorde betwene Ethelfryde &amp; Cadwan confyrmed / that they contynued durynge the lyfe of Cadwan as two especiall louers and frendes / and durynge the reygne of this Cadwan the two sonnes of Colricꝰ, Kyngilsus and Quichillynus, after the deth of theyr fathers brother Colwolphus, ruled ioyntly the pryncypate of westsaxons. The whyche in theyr begynnynge faught agayn the Brytons at Ampton besyde Oxynford / &amp; wanne of them the towne &amp; other holdes, whyche the Brytons in yt coūtre occupyed. But by agrement of wryters this Cadwan was not at this cō
                        flycte, nor yet medlyd hym so farre within ye land. But as yt shuld seme by Guydo / these Brytons shulde be some cōpany that shulde lyue vnder trybute of the Saxons / ye whych for the manhode yt they hard reported of Cadwan, rebelled agayn ye Saxons. Then it foloweth, whē this Cadwan had thus contynued his amite wyth Ethelfryde / a chaunge fell, that this Ethelfryde for hatered or otherwise put frō hym hys wyfe beynge great wyth chylde, &amp; toke to hym an other.

wherfore thys woman beynge reedlesse / callyng to mynde ye great loue, that was betwene her husbande and Cadwan, she went vnto hym, and specyally besoughte hym to recoenyle her lorde &amp; husbande, that she myght be restoryd to hys company. But for Cadwan after many meanes and requestis myght not bryng that about / he therfore tenderynge her necessyte, kepte her in hys owne courte tyll she were lyghted. The whyche at tyme brought fourth a man chylde whom she lette call Edwyn. And soone after was the wyfe of Cadwan delyueryd of a sonne, whom the father callyd Cadwalyn. But the authour of the Floure of hystoryes sayth yt these two chyldern were long borne before this tyme. The whych shuld seme to be true, for so myche as this Cadwalyn was of lawfull age to beweld his lande whē his father dyed / the which he coude not do, yf he hadde nowe be borne. But as affermeth Policronycon, yt shulde seme lyke to a fable, all the rehersayll that Gaufride maketh in the ende of hys boke / as well for Cadwalyn and Edwyn, as for the other cyrcūstaunce of the mater there rehersyd. whych varyeth from other wryters both for the tyme, and also for the mater, as somdeale is more in the hystorye hereof before made mencyon / and also by the cōtynuaūce of this storye. For as Giraldus Cambrens and other seyen / this Edwyn was the sonne of Elle or Ella kynge of Deyra / the whyche was persecutyd of Ethelfridus before named thē kynge of both prouynces, that is to meane Brennicia and Deyra, so sore that he was compellyd to flee to Redwaldus then kynge of Gestanglys. The whyche for mede or fere of the sayde Ethelfride, was lastely consentynge to haue betrayed Edwyn / of whyche daunger the sayde Edwyn was delyueryd by warnynge of a frende of hys.
                     After this escape as Edwyn satte vppon a time in a great study alone / a straunger apperyd to hym sodeynly, and sayde, I know well the cause of thy thought and heuynes. Therfore yf thyn enymyes were slayne, &amp; thou restoryd vnto thy kyngdome &amp; sette the in better maner then any of thy forefathers / woldyst thou not admytte such one for thy frende, and assent and do by his rede and coūsayll. yes trewly sayd Edwyn / and that I surely and fastely promise the. Then this man layd his hand vpon Edwynes hedde and sayde to hym, Edwyn when this token is broughte to the / then haue thou mynde of this tyme of trybulacyon, and of this promyse thou haste made. And anon as thys was spoken this man vanyshed out of his syght sodeynly.
                     In a conuenyent season after, Edwyn assemblyd hys hoste and gaue batayll vnto Ethelfryde in the countrey of Mercia by eest the ryuer of Idle / and slewe hym in that fyghte, wyth a great nōber of his knyghtes / and thē seasyd in his possessyon both the foresayde pryncypates / and was kynge of Northumberlande by the terme of .xvii. yeres.
                     ye shall vnderstande that the forenamed Ethelfride hadde .iii. sonnes, whyche are mynded besyde other. The fyrste &amp; eldest was named Eaufricus, the seconde Oswaldus, and the thyrde Oswye. The fyrst was of lawfull age / so that he myght helpe and shyft for hym selfe. But Oswald was but .xii. yeres of age / and Oswy farre yonger. wherfore theyr wardeyns immediatly after theyr faders deth, sente theym into Armorica or lytell Brytayne, there to be brought vppe / or more veryly into Albania or Scotlande.
                  
                  
                     
                     THE .CXXIX. CHAPITER.
                     ABoute this tyme and season, as wytnessen Policronica, Guydo, and other / began the kyngdome or lordshyp of Mercia, vnder the stronge paynym and Saxon called Penda. The whyche Mercia or Mercherike conteyned Huntyngdon shyre, Hertfortshyre, Gloucetershyre, wyth dyuers other / and was grettest and largeste of all the other / &amp; was closyd in ye west syde wyth the ryuer of Dee, stretchynge to Chestre &amp; Seuarne, and so to Shrouesburye and Brystowe / in the eest yt was closyd wyth the see Occean / in the South with Thamys vnto London / and in the north with ye ryuer of Hōber / and had hys begynnynge vnder the fore named Penda, as the accorde of dyuerse authours wytnessyth, in the yere of oure lordes incarnacyon .vi. hundred &amp; .xxvi / and after the fyrste commynge of Hengyste a hundred and lxxvi. yeres. All be yt that of the fyrste kyng dyuerse opynyons there ben / wherof a cause maye be, for so myche as this lordshyppe in the fyrst begynnyng was departyd in .iii / that is to say y• fyrst was called eest Mercia, the .ii. was named myddell Mercia, and the .iii. weste Mercia. But after yt was brought to one pryncypate &amp; called Mercherike, or of some wryter myddell Englande. Of thys lordshyppe the fyrste crysten kynge was called wolpherus that was the sonne of the forenamed Penda. But of all the kynges of thys kyngdome of Mercia, whych were .xviii. in nomber, as testyfyeth Policronica / Offa was of moste myght and power, as after shall more playnly appere.
                     This lordshippe endured to reken moste certaynly, tyll the yere of oure lorde .viii. hundred and .lxxvi. In the whych yere Alurede or Alhered then kynge of westsaxons, ioyned yt vnto his owne kyngdome / whych by that accompte shulde be two hundred &amp; .l. yeres. All be yt that some accompte the enduraūce therof, to the last yere of Burdredus that was putte out by the Danes / by whyche rekenynge yt shulde then endure .iiii. yeres lesse. And some wryters accōpte the terme therof whyle the tyme of Edward called the elder / whych after the deth of his fader Alured put out the Danes from the sayde lordshyppe, and ioyned yt agayne to westsaxon / and by that accompte yt shulde laste .ii. hundred .lxxx. yeres and odde.
                     ye shall also vnderstande, that in this kyngdome reygned dyuerse holy kynges, whyche nowe be alowed by the chyrche for sayntes / as Offa, Kenelphus, Kenelmꝰ, and other, as hereafter somedeale shall appere.
                     I haue seen an old regyster within the chyrche of Poulys of London / wherin ys conteyned many thynges concernynge the fyrst foundacyon of that chyrch, wyth certayne olde cronycles of thys lande. Amonge the whyche yt is there notyd, that in the tyme and season when Cadwan was kynge or ruler of the Brytons / that in the same moment and tyme reygned in dyuers partes of this lande these .vii. kynges vnder wryten. As fyrste Sybertus, that then was kynge of Eestsaxons no Essex, Redwaldus was then kynge of Eestanglys now Norff. and Suff. Ethelbertus was then kyng of Kēt, Ethelwaldꝰ was kynge of Southsex. Kyngylsus was kynge of westsaxons. Penda was kynge of Mercheryke. And Ethelfridus was then kynge of the North coūtre or Northumb. All whyche regyster this worke accordyth with, yf the storys of this Cadwan, Careticus, &amp; Cadwall be duely serchyd.
                  
                  
                     
                     THE .CXXX. CHAPITER
                     LEtte vs than retourne to the perfourmaūce of the story of Cadwan / and of such dedes as were done in his dayes. About the .xiiii. yere of his reygne, Quincellinus y• was brother vnto Kyngylsus, and kynge with hym, as before in the .C. and .xxviii. chapyter is touchyd, ruled ye westsaxōs / sent vpon an Eester day a swerdman to sle Edwyn kyng of Northumberland. This swerdeman came to a cytye besyde the water of Darwent in Derbysshyre, and wayted his tyme / and lastly fand the kynge smally accompanyed, and entended to haue ronne thorough the kynge wyth a sworde enuenemed. But one Lilla the kynges trusty seruaunt, dysgarnysshed of shylde or other wepyn to defende his mayster / starte betwene the knyg &amp; the sword, and was stryken thorough the body and dyed / and the kynge was wounded with the same stroke. And after he woūded the thyrde / and was takē and confessyd by whom he was sent to worke that treason. The other knyght that was secondly wounded dyed / and the kynge laye after longe syke or he were helyd. And the same nyght folowynge the quene was delyuered of a doughter / the whyche kyng Edwyn caused to be crystened of Paulinus ye bysshop, in tokē that he wolde fulfylle all suche promyse as he before had made. And she was named Enfleda / and halowed vnto god. And after whytsontyde y• kyng beynge scantly hole of the wounde, assembled his hoste &amp; made towarde the kynges of westsaxon / and after a greate and sore fyghte venquysshed them and theyr hoste. But Edwyn for all thys vyctory and other thynges gyuen to hym of god / as he that was in helthe of the worlde, forgate his former promesse, and had lytell mynde therof / excepte that he by the preachyng of Paulinus forsoke his maumētrye, and for his excuse sayde that he myghte not clerely renye his olde lawe that his forefaders hadde kepte so longe, and sodeynly be crystened without authoryte and good aduyse of hys counceyle. He also receyued letters of exhortacyon and cō
                        forte to take the baptyme, from ye .v. Boniface thā pope. The whiche also sent to the quene lyke letters, with a myrrour garnysshed with syluer and a combe of iuory, and for the kyng a shyrte wrought in sōdry places with letters of golde. But all this preuayled nothynge.
                     Then Paulinꝰ made his specyall prayers to god / and had it shewed to hym by reuelacyon, of the token that was gyuen to Edwyn in tyme of his trybulacyon. After the which knowlege hadde / Paulinus shortly after came vnto the kyng / and layeng his hande on hys hed, frayned of hym whyther he had any lyke remēbraū
                        ce of any lyke token. The whyche whan the kynge hadde confessyd / the holy bysshoppe sayde vnto hym. Lo thou hast ouercomen thyne enemyes and wonne thy kyngdome, &amp; holdest it in moste large wyse / therfore perfourme thy promesse, and be trew to hym that hath holpen thy.
                     It was not longe after that the kynge assemblyd hys counceyll / and by theyr agremēt he was of the sayd Paulinus byshop of yorke baptysed wythin the sayde cytye the .xi. yere of hys reygne / and the yere of grace, as testifyeth Guido .vi.C.xxvii. He was the fyrste crysten kyng that reygned in that coūtrey. And after hym many of hys lordes &amp; subiectes were also crystened of the sayd Paulinus / and the flamyns or bysshoppes of theyr false goddes, were turned to Crystes

faythe. In token wherof they armed them as knyghtes, &amp; bestrode good horses / where before by theyr lawe they myghte vse none armoure nor ryde but onely on a mare.
                     From that tyme forthwardes by the term of .vi. yeres, durynge the lyfe of kynge Edwyn, Paulinus crystened contynuelly in bothe prouynces of Deyra and in Brēnicia in the ryuers of Gweuy &amp; Swala, whyche he vsed for hys fontes / and preached in the shyre of Lyndesey / and buylded there a chyrche of stone at Lyndecoln or Lyncolne.
                     In thys tyme was so great peace in that kyngdome of Edwyne, that a woman myghte haue gone from one towne to an other without grefe or noyaunce.
                     And for the refresshynge of waye goers / this Edwyn ordeyned at clere wellys cuppes or dysshes of iron or brasse to be fastened to postes standynge by the sayd wellys sydes, and no man was so hardy to take awaye those cuppes / he kept so good iustyce and with that he was knyghtely of hys dedes.
                     He was the fyrste that wanne this ile of Eubonia now called the ile of man. And by hys meanes / Orpewaldus or Corpewaldus, the sonne of Redwaldus kynge of Eest anglis or Norphis / to whom as before is touchyd Edwyn had fledde for socoure, was conuerted to the true fayth, and a greate parte of his men with hym. And for this Edwyn excellyd ye other kynges / they enuyed at hym, and specyally Penda kynge of Mercia / the whyche excyted Cadwan kynge of Brytons agayne hym. So that they two assemblyd a great hoste agayne Edwyn, and lastly met in a palce called Hatfelde / and after sharpe fyght on bothe sydes there Edwyne was slayne, whan he had reygned ouer ye Northumbris .xvii. yeres, in the yere of our lorde, as sayth Guydo .vi.C. xxxiii. when these two kynges Cadwan or Cedwalla and Penda, hadde thus ouercomen the kynge and hym slayne and mych of hys people / they became so cruell to men of that countrey, that they destroyed therin mych people, as men, women, &amp; chyldren, as well religyous as other. wherfore Paulinus the archebysshop beholdyng theyr cruelnesse / toke with him the quene &amp; Enfleda hyr doughter, &amp; fled by water into Kent. And for the bysshoprych of Rochester was than voyde, by reason that Romanus the last bysshop was adreynte / Paulyne was there ordeyned and made bysshop of that see, and there dyed. And also lefte there his Paull, as affyrmeth Policronycon and other / the archebysshoppes see of yorke was voyde .xxx. yeres after. But ye quene whyche was named Etherberga became a menchon, &amp; sayled into Gallia or Fraunce / wherein an abbaye called Brydgence or Bryggence, she lyued an holy lyfe and dyed / and hyr doughter Enfleda cōtynued hyr professyon, and was afterwarde abbesse of Strenshalt in the vale of whitby.
                     After the deth of Edwyn Osrycus that was the sonne of Elfricꝰ which was brother of Ethelfridus, toke vppon hym to be kynge of Deyra / and Eaufricus the eldest sonne of Ethelfrida, as before in the .C. and. xxviii. chapiter is touched, was made kyng of Brennicia / the whyche turned thē both frō Crystes fayth, and became myscreaūtes. For the whych goddes wrech fell vpon them in short whyle after / for they were bothe slayne in ye yere folowynge, of ye fornamed Cadwan and Penda.
                     And whan these sayde two kynges were thus slayne / Oswalde y• second sonne of Ethelfrid began his reygne

ouer the prouynce of Brennicia, as chefe of that kyngdome of Northumberlande / and had the rule of Deira in lyke wyse. wherof whan Cadwan or Cedwalla was ware / he gathered hys Brytons and thoughte to slee Oswalde as he hadde before slayne his brother Eaufricus. But Oswald whan he was warned of the greate strength of thys Cadwan / he made his prayers to god, and besoughte hym mekely of helpe to withstande his enemyes. And or he yode to prayer he arreryd a crosse of tre / before the whyche he knelyd a longe whyle in a felde / whyche longe after was called Heuynfelde, and at thys daye is had in greate worshyppe. That place is nere vnto the town or chyrche of Agustalde in Brennicia / the whyche chyrche was there buylded by Oswalde after the wynnyng of that batayle. And of the spones of that crosse are tolde many wounders the whiche I ouer passe.
                     Than after Oswalde had prayed for the saluacyon of hys people / the two hostes met in a felde named thā Denysborne or Denyslake, where was foughten a stronge batayle. But fynally Cadwan, whyche Polycronyca nameth Cedwalla, was slayne and his people chasyd / which were farre excedynge the nomber of Oswaldus hoste / whanne the sayde Cadwan had reygned ouer the Brytons after moste accorde of wryters and also of the tyme, by the terme of xxii. yeres / leuynge after hym a son, as affermeth Gaufryde, named Cadwallus or Cadwalyn.
                  
                  
                     Francia. THE .CXXXI. CHAPITER.
                     DAgobertus the fyrste of that name, and sonne of Clothayr before rehersed / beganne his reygne ouer the hole monarchye of Fraunce in the yere of our lorde .vi. hundred xxxi / and the .xviii. yere of Cadwan than kynge of Brytons. The which at the tyme of hys faders deth was in the prouynce of Austracy, gyuen to hym by his fader, as before is shewed in the .C.xxvii. chapyter precedynge. But anone as worde came to hym of hys faders decease / he sped hym well accompanyed into Fraūce. And when he was comen to the cyty of Reynes thyder came vnto hym many nobles / as well out of Burgoyne as out of other partyes of Fraunce, and dyd vnto hym feauty and homage.
                     It is shewed in the .C.xxvi. chapyter of thys worke, how Clothayre had by his seconde wyfe a sonne named Heybert / the which claymed his parte of the kyngdome of Fraunce, and for ye same began to make some styrynge. But by the good polycy &amp; meanes of one Brunulphe vncle to the sayd Haybert, and brother to Sichyld hys moder, the mater was appeased / so that he had vnto hym certeyne cytyes assygned, wyth landes in Guyan. with the whiche he was cōtentyd / &amp; ordeyned Tholouse for the chefe cytye of hys pryncypate. And after that peace confermed / Dagobert was in quiete by the terme of iii. yeres folowyng. But the .iiii. yere the Gascoynes rebelled agayn hym / the whych by hys manhode he shortly subdued. And whan he had set his lande in a quyetnesse / he called to mynde ye promyse before tyme which he hadde made to saynt Denys and hys felowes. wherfore he with great solempnite caused the groūd, where these holy bodyes laye to be openyd / and wyth great reuerēce to be taken vp. Upon the whych bodyes he fand fresshely wryten eyther of theyr names, so that he myghte perfyghtely knowe that one from that other / and

then caused thē to be layd in a sumptuouse shryne. And ouer them in the sayd place he buylded a royall mynster of lyme and stone, and conueryd it with plates of syluer in stede of sclate or leade / and assygned vnto ye prestes and mynysters therof greate and ryche possessyons. And for so goodly a temple that was of suche beautye outwarde, shulde not lacke of garnysshynge within: he therfore causyd hangynges to be made to hange within the same temple / of the whiche tapettes suche as scruyd for the quere, were garnyshed &amp; set with dyuerse stones in those dayes vsed. And by the foresayde place or shryne where the holy martyrs bodyes laye he ordeyned a cheste or trūke of clene syluer / to the entēt yt all such iewelles and ryche gyftes as were offered to ye holy sayntes, shulde therin be kept to the vse of the mynysters of ye same place, and ouer that endowed yt same place with many greate lybertyes &amp; pryuyleges. And this place thus fynysshed / he caused a crosse of golde to be made, &amp; to be garnysshed with moste precyous stones of a greate bygnesse and value / and caused it to be set ouer the hyghe aulter wythin the sayde monastery.
                     This translacyon of these blessyd sayntes shulde be as wytnessyth the Frēche Cronycle, in the .v. yere of the reygne of the sayd Dagobert / which made ye yere of our lorde .vi.C.xxxvi. The which whā he had clerely with all honour and due reuerence fynysshed / he thā vysyted and cyrcued his lande in mynystrynge iustyce to all persons / and ordeyned such meanes as bylles of supplicacyon and other, that the causes and maters of poore men myghte come to his knowlege by meane wherof he gate great loue and fauour of his comons.
                     But amonge hys many notable dedes / one dede by hym was commytted, the whyche somdeale longe after blemysshyd hys honour. And that was that he without iudgement or processe of the lawes / caused to be slayne the forenamed Brunulphe vncle vnto Haybert hys brother, for malyce yt he bare to hym, for the fauouryng of ye sayd Haybertis party.
                     After thys the kynge was deuorsyd from his wyfe named Gertrude, for that she was bareyne &amp; broughte forthe no frute / and was after maryed to a fayre wenche named Ranetrude, of the whyche he receyued at conuenyent tyme after, a son that was named Sigebert. Of this chyld it is told that whan he was brought to the holy bysshoppe Amandus to be confermed, beyng than of the age of .xl. dayes / and the bysshoppe sayd ouer hym certeyne prayers concernynge the offyce of confyrmacyon, and none of the cyrcumstauntes by neglygēce gaue answere vnto ye bysshop at conuenyent tyme: the chylde by dyuyne power sayde, Amen, in so lowde maner that all the people about standynge myghte well vnder stande it / whereof the bysshoppe and all the people were hougely ameruayled.
                     Than it foloweth, this Dagobert all thys passetyme was ruled by a noble man of Fraunce, or more properly of the prouynce of Austracy, named in the Frenche booke saynte Arnulphe bysshoppe of Mees / and by Pepyn, whyche was ruler of the kynges paleys. By whyche season, he and also hys lande were in greate honour and prosperyte, tyll the deth of the forenamed Arnulphe / whych dyed about the season that the kyng beganne to alter and chaunge his cō
                        dycyons, to the hurte of hys comons and of hys lande.
                  
                  
                     
                     THE .CXXXII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        DAgobertus yt before exercised hym in all honour and vertue, beganne now to exercise iniustyce and tyrannye / in pyllynge hys commons by exaccyons and trybutes, in suche wyse that those that dwellyd in the outwarde partyes of hys realme, and nere vnto the Turkys and other straunge landes and nacions, were fayne to be vnder the rule of theym then of theyr owne naturall prynce. But howe so euer he bare hym agayne hys subiectes, in pyllynge and takyng from thē what he myght yet he euer hadde such a fauour to saynt Denys, that he gaue to hym what he myghte purchace, were yt wyth ryght or otherwyse. Contynuynge whyche season / he went into the countrey of Poytiers and robbyd and spoyled there the chyrche of saynte Hyllary, of many great iewellys / and after toke wyth hym the bodye of that blessyd man, and causyd yt to be hadde into the monasterye of saynt Denys, &amp; there shrynyd hym. And that done / he destroyed the coū
                        trey of Poytiers wyth iron and fyre / and the wallys of the cytye he made playne wyth the grounde. And for yt more cruelty or terrour to the people to be shewyd / he eryd the stretys of the sayde cytye, and sewe theym wythsalte for a sygne and token that he wolde haue that cytye subuertyd for euer. The whyche ruyne to thys daye appereth / for there where the olde cytye stode, is now called ye olde Poytiers / and where that other standyth nowe, is called the newe cytye of Poytiers. The cause of thys destruccion of the citye &amp; countre as sayeth mayster Roberte Gagwyne / was for, that that ye erle of Poytiers rebellyd agayne the kynge.
                     Thus this man that whylome was a lambe / was now turned to a tygre. And ouer hys cruelnesse he was gyuen to all sensuall luste of hys body / in so myche that where so he rode he hadde folowynge hym a company of strumpettes, besyde suche as he kept in dyuerse places of his realme, appareylyd and fed lyke vnto quenes.
                     For thys rule &amp; other vyces vsyd by the kynge / Pepyn then mayster of the paleys was put in great wyte and blame of dyuerse lordes of the lande / thynkynge that by hys counsayle and sufferaunce, the kyng was so lad and guyded. This was ye fyrst Pepyn. The seconde was mayster of the placys in that tyme of the seconde reygne of the fyrste Theodoricus / and was surnamed Uetulꝰ and Breuis, whyche is to meane old and lytle. And ye .iii. Pepyn was son of Carolus Marcellus. The fyrste Pepyn was graundefader to the seconde by the moders syde / and the seconde was graunsyr to the .iii. by ye mannes syde. whyche thyrde Pepyn was by hole assent of Frenchmen ordeyned kyng of Fraūce as after shall appere / &amp; was father vnto the kynge named Charlis the great and emperour of Rome. All whyche Pepyns descendyd of the blood of Austracye / and hadde great possessyons wythin that prouynce. when the forenamed Pepyn vnderstode the grudge and murmour of the lordes, whyche they bare agayne hym for the kynges demeanour / he by theyr aduyces toke vnto hym a nother great lorde named Martyn, to be vnto hym assystent / and ouer that he caused ye blessyd man Amandus to accompany ye kynge. By whose coūsayle the kyng somdeale refrayned hym from vyce / but not all as the good byshop hym

aduertysed.
                     In this tyme Heybart the kynges halfe brother dyed, and also hys son shortly after named Chilperych. By reason of whose dethes / the lordshyp and countrey of Tholouse fell to the possessyon of Dagobert. It was not longe after that a people called Asclauons or Sclauons, made warre vpon the coūtrey of Austracy. These also are called Bulgaris, and ioyne vppon a parte of Austracy. Of these tydynges when Dagobert was lerned / he sped hym into Austracy, and there assembled a myghtye hoste of knyghtes / &amp; so sped him tyll he came nere hys enymyes. But ye sayd Sclauons hauynge knowlege of the kynges great hoste, agreed by oratours to hym sent, to contynue the trybute that they before tyme payde / ye which was yerely fyue hūdred oxen. where thorough ye warre was appesyd for that tyme / and newe allyaunce vpon both partyes confermed.
                     After the whych peace thus stablysshyd / ye kyng made his son Sigebert as kynge &amp; ruler of that lordshyp of Austracy / assygnynge to hym the bisshop of Colayn named Cunbert, and the erle Palatyne named Agasyle, to be hys tutours and rulers contynuynge his yeres of youth. And that done, ye kyng retourned into Fraūce, where soone after he receyued of hys wyfe a sonne named Clodoueus, the whych of many wryters is called Lodouicus or Lowes. To thys Lowes the father at couenable tyme after gaue the countyes of Burgoyne and Neustria or Normandy.
                     Then the kynge graunted to the house of saynte Denys, a fayre to be kepte yerely in the moneth of Iune in a felde nere vnto the sayde monasterye / and that no marchaunte of Paris nor good towne there about; shulde sell any marchaundyse but onely in the fayre / wyth many other customes to the great auauncement of that house.
                     And after the kynge hadde subdued the Gascoynes, and the Brytons of Armorica or lytle Brytayne / he then assembled a multytude of bysshoppes for to dedycate and halowe the monasterye of saynte Denys in moste solemne wyse. where a great myracle was shewyd of the clensyng of a leper or lazar / that durynge the nyght laye wythin the sayde chyrch, and there beyng in his deuoute prayers, sawe our sauyour Cryste accompanyed wyth Peter and Paule, and also the holy martyrs saynte Denys wyth hys two felowes, entre the chyrche by one of the wyndowes / and after halowed the sayde chyrch. whyche after came to the sayd lazar / and commaunded hym to shew vnto the byshoppes, yt he in proper person hadde halowed the sayd chyrche / and for a token and knowlege of ye same, he hadde receyued hys helthe. And for more recorde of the trouth of this mater / our sauyour Cryste, as wytnessyth mayster Robert Gagwyn, &amp; also the frenche cronicle, drewe of the skynne of the face of the sayde lazar, and threwe yt agayne a stone, where yt remayneth at thys daye to be sene. The whyche token when Dagobert and his byshoppes vppon the morne after behelde and sawe / they beynge greatly ameruaylyd, laft of any forther besynesse touchynge the dedyfyenge of the sayde chyrche. For thys myracle great concurse of people yerely in the .vi. kalendis of Marche cōmyth wyth great deuocyon vnto ye sayd monastery, there makyng theyr oblacions / fermly beleuyng that the sayde chyrch was halowed with Crystes own hand. when Dagobert had this besynesse wyth other ꝑfyted &amp; endyd / he then called a great counsayll

of his lordes spyrytuall and tēporall at hys cytye of Biguage, where he beyng set betwene his .ii. sonnes Sigebert &amp; Clodoueus / he made a long preposycyon &amp; oracyon concernynge the allegyaunce / whyche he exhorted hys lordes to owe and bere to hym for the terme of his lyfe, and after to hys two sonnes there beynge prensent. And then he exhorted his .ii. sonnes charitably to loue / and that they shulde in moste fraternall wyse contynue theyr lyues. The whyche preposycyon fynyshed / he there in that presence made his testament, that before he hadde causyd to be wryten in iiii. sondry skynnes endentyd, to be rad, and then sealyd wyth certayn of theyr sealys / wherof that one he wyllyd to be kept in the treasory of saynt Denys, the .ii. in the treasorye of the cytye of Lyons, the .iii. in the tresory of Mees in Austracy, whyche howe is named Lorayne, and the .iiii. in the kynges tresorye. And when the kynge had orderyd hys matiers som deale to hys purpose / he dyssoluyd thys counsayll, and cōmaundyd eueryche estate vnto hys owne countre / and after was somwhat besyed wyth the rebellyon of the forenamed Brytōs and Gascoynes &amp; such other maters, the whyche I passe ouer for length of tyme.
                     Then the kynge lastely was syke of the flyx / and was brought by hys desyre vnto the monastery of saynte Denys. where after he had commytted hys wyse Nantyld wyth her son Clodoueꝰ vnto the guydyng &amp; tuycyon of a noble man of Fraūce, &amp; thē mayster of hys Paleys named Agaynus / he dyed, when he had reygned xiiii. yeres / &amp; was buryed with great pompe in the forenamed monastery.
                     Of this Dagobert is reported by myne authour, &amp; also the frenche cronycle besyde other wryters, that an holy ancre or heremyte of Fraunce beynge in his medytacyons, shuld se a company of fendes / whyche beyng in the see shuld haue amonge theym in a bote the soule of Dagobert, and were conueyenge yt towarde payne. But thys spiryte ceasyd not to crye &amp; to call to saynt Denis and his felowes for helpe / the whyche lastely came clad in whyte vestymentes &amp; delyuered that soule from the paynes of his enymyes, and conueyed it vnto euerlastynge ioy / as more at length and wyth more cyrcūstaunce yt ys declared in the bokys beforesayde.
                  
                  
                     Anglia. THE .CXXXIII. CHAPITER.
                     CAdwallus or Cadwalyne the sonne of Cadwan lastely spoken of in ye cronycle of mych Britayn as testyfyeth Guydo, Gaufryde, and other / beganne hys reygne ouer the Brytons in the yere of Crystes incarnacyon .vi. hundred &amp; .xxxv / &amp; ye fyrst yere of the fyrst Dagobert then kyng of Fraunce / and also the .xii. yere of Kyngilsus &amp; Quichillinus then kynges of westsaxon. This Cadwallus was stronge and myghty, &amp; warryd strongly vpon the Saxōs nere vnto hym / and wanne from them both castels and townes, and droue theym backe into the lande towarde London. wherof herynge Penda kynge of Mercia / he assembled his Saxōs and made towarde Cadwall. But he was in the ende dystressyd / and fayn to seche and purchace the fauoure of Cadwal, and lyue vnder his tribute. This Penda after this was in great fauour with Cadwall / in so myche yt he toke parte wyth Cadwall agayne his other Saxon kynges, as after shall appere. About thys tyme Kyngylsus one of the kynges of westsaxons

/ was by the doctryne of ye blessyd man Berinꝰ cōuertyd to ye ryght beleue, and cristyned of hym at the citye of Dortyke or Dorchester. And Oswald kynge of Northumberland was hys godfather / and weddyd his doughter afterwarde. And then that cytye was geuen to the byshop, to the ende that he shuld there ordeyne hys see / where the sayde Berinꝰ sat .xiiii. yeres after, &amp; there was buryed / tyll Beda bishop of wynchester trāslatyd his body to ye citye of wynchester: all be it yt the chanōs of Dorchester sayē, that the sayd bodye of holy Beryne was not taken thens but a nother in the stede of hym. And yet in tokē therof / a beers of wonder worke stādyth at this day ouer that graue / where ye holy man was fyrst buryed. It shuld seme that this cytye of Dorchester is now called Dorset. Thys see was in the tyme of wyllyam conqueroure chaunged to Lyncolne.
                     About thys tyme Sigebertus or after some Segebertus kynge of Eestenglande or Norfolke, whyche reygned there next his brother Corpwaldus / ordeyned letters to be lernyd, and set scolys in dyuerse places of his kyngdome / and ordeyned ouer thē schole maysters &amp; pedagoges, as he somtyme hadde seen in Fraunce. The whyche Sygebert was conuertyd to Crystes fayth by the doctryne of an holy man named Felix / ye which he was fyrste acqueynted wyth in Fraūce or in Burgoyne. The whych Felix came soone after that acqueyntaunce into Eestanglia or Norfolke / where the kynge made hym byshop of Dūwyche nowe called Thetford. Lastelye the kynge betoke hys kyngdome vnto hys neuew Egritus / and became a munke in an abbay whych he hym selfe buyldyd.
                     But when Penda kynge of Mercia warryd after in that coūtrey / the sayde Sygebert was agayne hys wyll pulled oute of the sayde monastery, and went in armes, or as some testyfye vnarmyd wyth a whyte rod in hys hande nycely, &amp; so was slayne, and well nere all his hoste of knyghtes that came wyth hym to that feld.
                     By this rehersayll apperyth here dyscorde of wryters of the begynnyng of this sayd kyngdome of Eestanglis. For yf yt were true that this beganne as wytnessyth Policronycon in the .iiii. chapyter of hys fyfte boke, in the yere of grace .iiii. hūdred lxxx. and .xii, as before also I haue shewed in the .lxxx. and .xvi. chapyter of this worke: then myght yt not agree wyth conuenyency of tyme, that this Sygebert or Sebert shulde reygne as kynge at those dayes nowe mynded. wherfore ye sayenge of Guydo is more concordaunte / whyche shewyth this kyngdome to haue his begynnynge in the yere of grace .v.C. &amp; .lxx, as in the ende of the forsayd chapyter yt is there shortly touched.
                     Then yt foloweth in the story / after the deth of this Sigebert, Anna was made kyng of Eestanglis.
                     And durynge the reygne of Sigebertus, befell the wōder yt is tolde of that holy man Furceꝰ / as is shewed at lēgth in the .xiii. chapiter of the .v. boke of Policronicon aforesayd / and in the .xiii. tytle of the .vi. chapyter of the .ii. parte of ye famous worke called Summa Antonini.
                     And about this season reygned or began to reygne the cursyd secte of ye detestable &amp; false prophete Machomet / ye which syns ye tyme hath so enfected / yt it hath enfectyd .ii. prīcipall ꝑtes of ye world, as Asia, &amp; Affrica / &amp; the more part of ye third named Europa / &amp; dayly wynneth vpon the crysten peple great lādes &amp; possessions. Aboute the .vii. yere of thys forenamed Cadwall kynge of Britons / reygned

in Kent a Saxon kyng named Ercombertus, the whyche had that pryncypate .xx. yeres nobly.
                     And amonge other of hys famous dedys / he reuyued and quyckened agayne the fayth of Cryste, that in some places of hys kyngedome was sore appallyd. For he destroyed the temples of false goddes thorough all that countrey / and ordeyned by the aduyse of his clergye, the tyme of lente to be fasted. He wedded the doughter of Anna kynge of Eestanglis named Sexburga / of whom he receyuyd a doughter and named her Eukengoda / ye whyche after was a menchon or nunne in the abbey of Brydgence in Fraunce before mynded, where Ethelburga ye wyfe somtyme of Edwyn kynge of Northoumberlande serued god, as in the hundred and .xxx. chapyter precedynge yt ys shewed / and eyther of them was abbesse of the same place. And though at those dayes there were many abbeys in thys yle of myche Brytayne / yet many both of men and of women sayled into other landes / as Fraūce, and Burgoyne and other places, because the conuersacyon and lyuynge of those countres were of more fame and perfeccyon then was then vsyd in thys yle of Brytayne.
                     About thys tyme as yt were about the .viii. yere of Cadwall / dyed kyngylsus kyng of westsaxons, when he had reygned with his brother and alone .xxxi. yeres. And Kenwalcus his sonne was kynge after hym / ye which in ye begynnyng of his reygne wolde not be crystyned / &amp; forsoke hys wyfe the doughter of Pēda, &amp; toke to hym a nother. wherfore Penda in aduengynge hys doughter / gatheryd hys hoste, and chasyd Kynwalcus out of his kyngdome / &amp; kept hym thens .iii. yeres. By whyche season was Anna kynge of Eestanglis / &amp; there conuertyd to the feyth of Cryste, &amp; cristyned of Felix aforenamed then byshoppe of Dūwyke or Thetforde / and after he recoueryd hys kyngdome, by the ayde and assystence of the sayde Anna. when Kenwalcus was restoryd to hys lande / he made a byshoppes see at Kaerguent or wynchestre / and ordeyned there a byshop named Agilbert a frenche man of byrthe, but he was called out of Irlād. The which when he had sytten there a certayn of tyme / he was put thēs I ne wote for what cause / and in his place was set an other named wyn. Of this wyn, as sayeth Policronicon, the towne of wynchester toke ye name, as he declaryth in ye .liii. chapyter of his fyrst boke / as yt were wynnes cytye. But he was also putthens / and then was Leutherius byshop, and after Leutherius succedyd Cedda. And after Theodorus the archbyshop of Caunterbury ordeyned two byshoppes to that prouynce of westsaxō. That one at wynchester / &amp; to that was subiecte two coūtreys Southrey and South hampshyre. And that other see he ordeyned at Shyreborne, to the which were subiecte .vi. coūtreys, that is to saye Berkshyre, wyltshyre, Somersetshyre, Dorsetshyre, Deuenshyre, &amp; Cornewayll. But in wyllyam the cō
                        querours tyme ye see of Shyreborne was tourned to Salysbury with the see of Rāmysburye.
                     It was not longe after that Kenwalcus was warreyd with the kyng of Brytons / the whyche fought with hym at a place called wyght Gosneborough, and were of him there ouercomyn. Then Cadwall assembled a newe hoste of Brytons / and mette wyth Kenwalcus at a place called the hyll of Pent / where after longe fyghte the Brytons were putte to flyghte.
                  
                  
                     
                     YE haue harde before how that blessyd man Oswall the son of Ethelfryde, was ordeyned kynge of Northumberlande / the whyche contynued hys lyfe in iustyce and vertue as kynge, by the terme of .ix. yeres. But Penda kynge of Mercia, that to hym &amp; to all crysten men had great disdayne and enuye / about the ix. yere of Cadwall made warre vppon Oswald, and slew hym in a feld callyd Meserfeld / where after hys deth god shewed for hym many myracles. But after one yere of his deth Oswy his yonger brother recoueryd the kyngdome / and buryed his hed in the chyrcheyarde of Lyndesar, for the bodye was conueyed by the Pagans and deuyded in sundry peces. But yt is sayde that the hed is nowe at Durham betwene saynt Cutberttus armes. And the other parte of ye bodye whyche was longe after founden / was had to the abbay of Burdeaux, by Ostrida doughter of Oswy &amp; quene of Mercia. where straūgnesse was made by the ruler of that hous for the receyte of those relykes, tyll a myracle or dyuyne token there was shewyd. But after the sayde bodye &amp; bones were brought to Glowceter to an hous of chanōs / and one of hys armes is at Peterboroughe, hole of fleshe &amp; fell as some haue and tellen. whan Oswy had a season rulyd hys kyngdome / he fande vnlefull meanes to slee Oswyn that was kynge of Deyra. This Oswyn was the son of Eaufrycus eldest brother of Oswalde / whyche Oswyn was good of condycyon, and there wyth both meke and mylde. when thys Oswyn was slayn by the consent of his neuewe Oswy / then Oswy toke to hym as felow of that kyngdome his broders sonne Odylwaldus the son of Oswalde. Thys Oswalde gaue vnto Cedda byshoppe of whynchester before named a groūde in a place of the North coūtrey in the hygh hylles called Lastyngaye, for to buylde vpon an abbay, which he there buyldyd / &amp; after there taught his brother Chymbyllus how he shuld rule that place. Pēda kynge of Mercia, which forgate not the strengthynge and fauourynge that Anna kynge of Eestanglys had shewyd to Kenwalchus hys doughters husband and his enymye / gaderyd a power of knyghtes, and yode agayne the sayde Anna, &amp; slewe hym in playne batayll. And the same yere one Botulphus buyldyd an abbay besyde Lindecolne or Lincolne, in a place that hyght I canno.
                     And as wytnessyth Beda in the .iiii. chapiter of his thyrd boke / thys yere whych shuld be the .xxi. yere of ye reygne of Cadwall, Penda that of thys former vyctory was supprysyd wyth great pryde, came wyth hys hoste into the boundes of Northumland / entendynge to slee Oswy, as before he had slayne his brother Oswalde. wherof whē Oswy was ware he assemblyd hys knyghtes &amp; made towarde hym. And for affynyte of maryage ye was betwene theyr chyldren, as after shall be shewed, and other causes / Oswy offeryd to hym many great offers, to the entente to haue had hym refused that batayll, &amp; to haue hadde peace with hym. when Oswy perceyued the obstynacye and pryde of Pēda, and saw that by no reasonable offers he myghte of hym wynne no peace / he sayde / sens thys paynym can not receyue our gyftes and proffers that we haue offeryd to hym, we shall offer thē to hym that can receyue theym.
                     And anon he made hys auowe vnto god, that yf he myght haue vyctory of his enymyes, he shuld offer his

doughter Elfleda to hym wyth suffycyent possessyons for to buylde .xii. abbayes / and after ioyned in batayll with the sayde Penda in the coūtrey of Ledis not farre from yorke / which was so sore foughten, yt the lyke therof was not seen many yeres beforne. But fynally Penda was slayne, and xxx. of his chefe captayns with hym / and yet he had thryes the people that Oswy hadde. And those that scaped the shot and the swerde / were for the more partye drowned in the ryuer of wynwed, whyche was nere vnto the place of that batayll. And among the prysoners that were taken at this felde / the wyfe of Penda was one, and her sonnes vncle named Egfridus was an other. Then Oswy yelded hys thankes to god / and accordynge to hys former promyse, he offryd hys doughter Elfleda or Enfleda of the age of .iii. yeres vnto god, and toke her to the lore of Hylda abbesse of Hertsey or Hertis iland. And after that the sayde Hylda remoued to the abbaye of Stremshalte in the vale of whitby .xxx. myle from yorke / where she was after abbesse, &amp; ye sayd Elfleda also. And Oswy as he had promysed / gaue landes and rentes to buyld .xii. abbeys. wherof .vi. were in the prouynce of Brēnicia, and .vi. in the prouynce of Deyra.
                     This fornamed Penda hadde dyuerse sonnes by accorde of wryters / that is to meane wolferꝰ weda, and Egfridus, besyde other not mynded. To this seconde sonne weda, Oswy had beforetyme maryed a doughter of his by cōsent of Penda his fader / The whyche weda by helpe of Oswy was made kynge of south Mercia, the whyche lordshyp is seueryd from the northe Mercia by the ryuer of Trent, and conteyned by recorde of holy Beda fyue thousande housholdes. This weda also promysed when he maryed the sayd doughter of Oswy, that he shulde become a crysten man / the whyche he perfourmyd after the deth of his father. But when he hadde scantly reygned thre yeres ouer the sayd Southmercis / he was by the treason of hys wyfe slayne. And after that kyngdome fell to wolferus the other brother / the whyche hadde weddyd the doughter of Ercombert kynge of Kent named Ermenylda. This wolferus was shortly after crystyned or before / so that he is accōpted for the fyrste cristened kyng that reygned in Mercia. This was fader to Keneredus, &amp; that holy virgyne and menchon wereburga.
                     And for yt is longe that I spake of Kenwalcus kynge of westsaxons / yt is to be noted that after he hadde ouercomen the Brytons, as before is shewyd, and at that tyme had not perfyted the byshoppes see of Kaerguent or wynchester, he then besyed hym there about. And accordyng to the wyll of kyngylsus hys father / he gaue to the sustentacyon of the sayd see all the lande whyche laye wythin vii. myles of the sayde cytye, as affermeth the authoure of the Floure of hystoryes / and fynyshed yt somdele to hys purpose.
                     But let no man thynke that it was buylded as yt is nowe. For nother yt nor none other ben at this daye standynge monastery, paleys, nor other / but yt they haue ben sens those daies alteryd, and new chaūged, and some clerely throwē downe, and some new buylded / all be yt that many stande vppon theyr fyrste foundacyon as thys yet dothe.
                     Soone after that Kenwalcus had endyd this worke / he made warre vppon wolferꝰ of Mercia. But in that iourney fortune was not to hym fauourable / for he loste thereby, &amp; wan nothynge of hys entent.
                     
                        It was not long after that Ercombert kynge of Kent dyed / and his son Egbert was kyng after hym .ix. yere.
                     And soone thereafter fell great mortalyte and sekenesse in thys lande of Brytayne / the whyche cōtynued and encreasyd more and more durynge ye lyfe of Cadwall now kyng of Brytons and of Cadwaldyr hys successour or sonne, after some writers. In the whyche season and begynnynge of this mortalyte and sekenesse, dyed many byshoppes in this lande / in so myche that Uitalcanus then beynge pope, ordeyned Theodorus archbysshoppe of Caūterbury to haue ye rule of the chyrches of Brytayne.
                     Somwhat before this tyme, Benet that was in good fauour wyth kyng Ofwy, &amp; dyscendyd of ryche kynne forsoke seruyce and house, and all hys kynred, and became Crystes seruaunt. He went .v. sythes to Rome and came agayne / and at euery tyme he brought wyth hym relykes or bokes of Crystes lore. And lastely he was made munke / and buyldyd .ii. abbeys, that one ouer agayn ye other vppon the ryuer of wyre, that renneth in the countrey of.
                     This Benet was the fyrst yt brought the crafte of glasyng into this lande / and he was Abbot of both the foresayde abbayes / and toke to hys lore Beda when he was but .vii. yeres of age, and taughte hym durynge hys lyfe. Of the vertue and pacyence of thys holy munke and byshoppe Benet, I myghte make a longe rehersayll. But for the holynes of his lyfe is declaryd in the legende of sayntes and other bokes of authoryte / here for lengthynge of the tyme I ouer passe yt, and wyll retourne agayne to Oswy. The whyche when he had longe reygned ouer the Northumbers / he made Cedda that was abbotte of Lastyngay, archbishoppe of yorke, more by wyll then by skyll / and put out wylfrida the archbishop of that see. But yt was not longe after that Cedda was depryued of that dygnyte by the authoryte of tharchebisshop Theodorus / as he depryuyd dyuerse other that tyme, whych came to theyr benefyces agayne the ordynaunce of the holy lawes of Crystes chyrche / and made hym by great instaunce after thys, byshoppe of westsaxons. And about the .xxx. yere of the reygne of Cadwall Cissa that was father to Ine kynge of westsaxons / buyldyd ye abbey of Abyndon. In these dayes the munkes and clergye of Brytayne, set all theyr myndes to serue god and not the worlde, the herte and not the wombe. wherfore they were then hadde in great reuerence &amp; honour / so yt they were thē receyuyd wyth all worshyp. And as they went by ye stretys &amp; wayes / men that sawe them, wold ronne to them and desyre thē blessynges. And well was hym that thē myght gyue vnto them possessyons, &amp; buyldyd to them houses &amp; chyrches. But as they encreasyd in ryches of the worldly treasoure / so they dyscreaced in heuenly treasour / as in the dayes of Aluredus somdeale beganne, and sythen that tyme hath spronge not all to the pleasure of god / wherof all is to be cōmytted to his pleasure. Then they plyed nothynge that was worldely / but gaue them to prechynge and techynge of the worde of our sauyour / and folowyd the lyfe that they preachyd, by gyuynge of good example. And ouer that they were so voyde of couetyse, that they receyuyd no possessyons, but yf yt were perforce.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXXXV. CHAPITER.
                     OSwy kynge of Northumberlande dyed / and Edfrydus his

sonne was kyng after hym .xv. yeres Hys fader had reygned wyth hys felowes Oswynus and Odyswalde xxviii. yeres. Edfrydus or Egfrydus had to wyfe that holy woman Ethelfryde, yt before was the wyfe of Tonbertꝰ prynce of the south Eyrwayes, the whyche whan Egfrydus hadde holden .xii. yeres as hys wyfe, and myghte not in that whyle haue leue of hyr to deale wyth hyr carnally for prayer nor great gyfte / he then gaue to hyr lycence to be a menchyon at Colud vnder Aebba, that than was awnte vnto hym. And after she remened to Ely, and there was abbesse, &amp; lyued in greate penaunce and abstynence / and dyed there, after she had ben .vii. yere abesse.
                     And Kenwalcus kynge of weste Saxon, dyed about the yere of the reygne of Cadwall kyng of Brytōs, the .xxxix. when he had regned ouer them .xxx. yeres. And hys sonne Kenewinus succedyd hym / after that Sexburga hys mother or wyfe to hys fader, had ruled that prouynce one yere.
                     Cedda the bysshop of westsaxons dyed / and hys deken wenfrede was hys successoure. And whan he was put down / the abbot of Medāpstede that now is called Peterboroughe, was there bysshop after hym.
                     Sone after this tyme dyed wyna bysshop of Lōdon / after whom was bysshop Erkenwald, the whych was brother to Ethelburga or Alborough the Menchen, and after abbesse of Berkynge in Essex. Thys holy bysshop Erkenwalde foundyd the monasteryes of Chertsey in Southery, and Berkynge afore sayde / whyche place hath ben preserued sens ye fyrst foundacyon. But that of Chertsey was throwen downe by the Danes and reedyfyed by Edgar kynge of Englande, as after foloweth.
                     After the deth of wolpherus kyng of Mercia / reygned hys brother Etheldredus. And the wyfe of wolpherus named Ermenilda, was made a menchon at Ely / and wereburga his doughter was also made a nonne at Trikyngham, and dyed at hamburgam, where she laye in the Erth .iii. hundred yeres hole and sounde / and after that she was conueyde to Chester. Thys Etheldredus kynge of Mercia had .iii. holy doughters / yt is to say Mylburga, Myldreda, and Mylguida / and a sonne of great holynesse named Meresyn. But after some wryters all these forsayde chyldren shulde be the chyldren of wolpherus and not of Etheldrede. And wolpherus also had .ii. holy susters named Kynedda and Kyneswyda, bothe nonnes and buryed at Peterborough / where saynte Ethelwolde buyldyd after an abbey of maydens.
                     ye haue harde before how wylfryd was put out of ye see of yorke / wherefore he went to Rome and complayned hym to Agathon the pope / and was well allowed in some thynges. But the kynge and Theodorus had there such protectours and frendes / that he retourned without spedynge of hys cause. wherfore he retourned vnto the South Saxons, and buylded an abbey in Silesey, and preachyd to the south Saxons .xv. yeres, and conuertyd myche people / and shewed there a greate wonder. For where by ye terme of .iii. yeres before hys commynge there fell no rayne vppon the grounde / by hys prayer / god sent to them rayne, &amp; the groūde began to burgen and wax grene, yt before was bareyn &amp; dryed for lacke of water. He also taught to them the crafte of fysshynge.
                     Egfrydus kynge of Northumberlande claymed the lande that Etheldrede kynge of Mercia helde / for the

whyche dyuerse assembles of treaty bytwene them were had, but all were dyssoluyd wythout agremēt. wherefore eyther ꝑty gathered hys strēgth and met vppon a playne nere vnto ye ryuer of Trent / where was foughtē bytwene them a longe and sharpe fyght. In the whiche among a great nombre on bothe parties, was slayn ye brother of Egfryde named Elswynus / but Edfryde or Egfryde had the better. Than after this batayle meanes of peace were agayn treatyd / so yt fynally Edfryde had great summes of Money in recompencement of his Brothers deth / &amp; so restyd the sayd .ii. kynges accorded. In this batayll was takē as prisoner a knyght of Egfryde, the which after hys takynge was solde to one Fryson by the knyghtes of Ethelfryde. This Fryson to thentent to haue his prysoner the shortelyer redemed kept hym in bandes of iron which prysoner had to his brother a preest &amp; a vertuous man, that for the delyuere of his brother prayed dayly By meane of whose prayers as oftē as ye sayd preste sang masse / so often were the bandes of iron lousyd from the prysoner duryng the tyme of the masse. The whyche so cōtynued, tyll he was clerely delyuered, and hys raunson payde.
                     And in thys yere apperyd stella comata a blasynge sterre, whyche betokeneth deth or mortalyte of ye people And in the yere folowynge dyed of ye Epedemye sykenesse, the holy abbes of Ely saynt Etheldrede / hyr suster Sexburga that somtyme hadde ben wyfe to Ercobert kyng of Kent, was hyr successoure. And thys yere also dyed Helda ye holy abbesse of whythy before spoken of, whiche was neuew to Edwyne lately kynge of Northū
                        berlande. In thys abbey were also bretherne vnder the rule of Hylda, as at these dayes ben at Syō vnder the abbesse there. wherfore sondry of thē were made bisshoppes, as Besa, wylfryde, and other. Amonge these bretherne was one named Cedman a man of greate perfeccyon / ye which by inspyracyon was taught to make dytyes and songes to moue men to deuocion, wherin he passyd all other at those dayes.
                     Soone after thys tyme Theodorꝰ for dyuerse causes, kepte a synode or counceyll of Bysshoppes and other men of the chyrche at Hatfelde. By authoryte of whych counceyll he deuyded the prouynce of Mercia, that Sexwolphus then ruled alone, into v. bysshopryches / that is one to Chestre, the seconde to worcetyr, ye thyrd to Lychefelde, the fourth to Cedema in Lyndesey, &amp; the .v. to Dorchester.
                     About the .xlvi. yere of the reygne of Cadwall, Kenewynus kynge of westsaxons had occasyon of warre agayne ye Brytons, so that they met nere vnto the west see / where after a sharpe skyrmysshe ye Brytōs were chasyd. And soone after Egfrydus kynge of Northumberlande made warre vpon the Pyctes or Scottes / bycause they fauouryd greatly ye cest anglis agayne hym. But lastly by colour or fleyng backe / they brought Edfryde into a streyte amonge Hylles and mountaynes, and slewe hym there with a grete part of his people. And after his deth a bastard brother of hys named Alfridus Notus was kynge of Northumberlande, &amp; reygned there .xviii. yeres, as wytnessyth willyam wryter of storyes of kynges And shortly after dyed Cadwall or Cadwalyne kynge of Brytōs / when he hadde reygned as testyfyeth Galfryde, Guydo, &amp; other .xlviii. yeres. But nother Polycronyca, nor none of the other authours of authoryte, which Policronica allegyd / shewyth

any lyke actes of thys Cadwall as Galfryde doth / nor yet that he shuld be buryed to the terrour and fere of the Saxons / or an image of brasse set of hym vppon an horse ouer the west gate of Londō called Ludgate or yet the chyrche of saynt Martyne there now stondynge shulde be buyldyd by the Brytons, to the ende to pray for the sayd Cadwall and hys Frendes / or ye Cadwaladrus, whych of Beda is named Cedwalla, shulde be hys sonne / as of ye sayd Gaufryde is affermed.
                  
                  
                     Francia. THE .CXXXVI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        CLodoueus ye yonger sonne of Dagobert, &amp; of Nautylda hys wyfe / beganne hys reygne ouer the myddell parte of Fraunce and other partes therof, in the yere of our lorde .vi.C.xlv / and the .x. yere of Cadwall then kynge of Brytons. And hys elder brother Sigebert was made kynge of Austracy or Lorayne accordynge to the wyll of Dagobert theyr fader. Thys as before is sayd of some wryters is called Lowes / the which was guyded by hys mother &amp; by the coū
                        seyle of Agaynus than mayster of hys Paleys / to whom the fader had by hys lyfe commytted hym, for he at thys daye was yonge of age and of dyscrecyon. And shortly after he was made kynge / all suche porcyon as belonged to the ryght of hys brother Sigebert, which was the thyrd of hys faders treasour and iewelles, was to hym delyuered. whych dystrybucyon made / he sped hym to Orleaunce, and thyder called to hym the lordes of Burgoyne, and receyued of them feauty and homage / &amp; ordeyned there for hys leutenaunte or deputye a noble Burgonyon named Flantas̄ / &amp; gaue to hym in mariage the neuew of hys mother Nautylda named Ranebert. And after with a due charge to hym gyuen for guydyng of the sayd countrey / sent hym and the other lordes into Burgoyn. But wythin a season of tyme after wilibaldus a great man of birth and myght, enuyed this Flantas̄ / in suche wyse that he had hym in dysdaynynge, and began to dystourbe the countrey &amp; the kynges peace. wherof herynge Clodoueus / in all hast commaunded the sayd wilibaldus to appere before hym. But whyle wilibaldus sent an erle &amp; a bysshop to ye kynges courte to purchace hym frendys about the kynge / he was in that whyle slayne by the gyle of hys enemy Flantas̄.
                     About the .iiii. yere of the reygne of Clodoueus dyed his mother Nautylda, a woman of great wisdome &amp; of vertuous condicion / and was honorably buryed by Dagobert hyr husbande in the church of saynt Denys. Soone after ensued such scarcety of corne / y• whete &amp; other greynes were at an excedynge pryce. For after the rate of money nowe currāt, a quarter of whete was worth .ii. markes &amp; a halfe / by meane of which scarcitye myche poore people were famisshed &amp; dyed for defaut. wherefore the kyng entendyng a remedy for the nedy people / causyd ȳe house or church of saynt Denys that his fader before tyme had coueryd with plates of syluer, to be rased of &amp; coueryd with lede / &amp; that syluer to be dystributyd amonge the poore comōs, to socoure thē agayn the great and huge famyn that then reygned / all be it that this ded was somedeale withstanden by Agulphus Abbot of that place for that tyme.
                     
                        About the .viii. yere of his reygne / the firste Pepyn that than ruled the house of Sigebert kyng of Austracy, dyed. And soone after dyed Agaynus mayster of the paleys of Clodoueus. For which .ii. princis in eyther Countreys that they rulyd, great dole and sorowe was for theym made. After the deth of which sayd Prī
                        cis / a noble man &amp; cosyn to Dagoberte late kynge, was chosen mayster of the paleys with Clodoueus
                     Thus kynge Clodoueus otherwyse called Lowes, contynued his reygne in great peace &amp; prosperyte, tyll lastly it fell in his mīde that he wolde vysyte ye sepulcre of saynt Denys where after he had done certayne obseruaūces, and made his prayers / he wolde nedely se the holy relykes and handle them. wyth the doynge whereof it semed the holy martyrs were not contentyd. For immedyately ensued suche a derknes, that the kynge and all that were aboute hym were wyth it greately astonyed and aferde, in so mych that the kyng loste the vse of reason, and wente from hym selfe more than two yeres folowynge. It is wryten of some authours, that the kynge handelyd the body of saynte Denys so rabbysshely that he brake one of his armes. But the Frenche booke and mayster Roberte Gagwyne sayen, yt he dysseueryd one of the armes from the sayd holy body / the whych he after whan he was somdele restoryd to hys helthe, closyd in golde and precyous stoones, and restored it to the sayd monasterye / and lyued vppon two yeres folowynge that he was amendyd, but not lyke vnto hys former beynge / so yt he lastly dyed whan he had reygned syke and hole by ye terme of .xvi. yeres, not without vyce as glotony, lechery, &amp; excedyng aueryce. And was buryed by hys parentes in the monasterye forenamed / leuynge after hym thre sonnes named Clotharius, Chyldericus, and Theodorych. After whose deth hys wyfe named Batylde / became a nonne in the monastery of Corbye, that she before tyme had newly renued or reedyfyed / and ended there in holy lyfe.

The whych by coūceyll of his lordes sent his yonger brother Chylderych into the lordshyp of Austracy or Lorayne, to guyde that coūtrey / wyth the ayde and assystence of wolphanus a noble man of ye countrey. For Sigeberte laste kynge of that prouynce / was before this tyme dede wythout heyre of hys body. This Theodorych gaue hym all to slowth &amp; rest / so that the gouernaūce of the realme was all in the power of

the mayster of ye paleys, whych was styll contynuynge, the forenamed Eboryne. The whyche among other cruell dedys by hym done / he emprysoned the holy bishoppe of Oston called Leodegayr. And lastely after many tormentes and vylanyes to hym done / he raced hys eyen oute of hys hedde. This dede wyth many other to the kynges dyshonour he

By meane wherof Eboryn dyd what to hym was lykynge / and vexyd and troubled the people greuously. wherfore by one assent ye lordes assembled theym / and by authoryte depryued the kynge of all dignytye / and closyd hym in a monastery, there to contynue the resydue of hys lyfe, when he hadde borne the name of a kynge wythout execucyon of the acte therunto belongynge .iii. yeres / and the cruell Eboryn they exyled to Luxon or Luxunborgh in the prouynce of Burgoyne / and not to departe thens vppon payn of hys lyfe.

                     CHildericus or Hildericus the thyrde sonne of Clodoueus, that was sent to rule the prouynce of Austracy / was ordeyned kynge of Fraunce in the yere of grace .vi. hundred .lxix. &amp; the .xxxiii. yere of Cadwal before named. Of the whyche dede the sayde lordes shortely after repended thē. For this Chylderych which was yonge and of lyght maners, oppressyd his subiectes greuously / and vsed the lawes of hys progenytours after hys pleasure and wyll / &amp; wold nothynge be aduertised nor ruled by wolphanus before named, ye whyche was before tyme assigned to hym for hys counceyllour and guyde. But in augmentynge his malyce / he caused a noble mā of his realme named Bolyde, wythout gylte or trespace or greuous offence doynge, to be bounden to a stake, and there betyn tyll he yelded the spyrite. For ye whych crueltye and other / the lordes wyth the cō
                        mons murmuryd sore agayne hym, ferynge lyke punyssyon wythout deseruynge. wherfore they conspyryd agaynste hym, and moste specyally two noble men of byrth &amp; of myghte named Iugebert &amp; Amabert. which two wyth other awayted theyr tyme &amp; season whē they myght fynde tyme cōueniēt to bryng ye kyng out of lyfe. And vpon a daye when yt kyng with his wyfe and small companye wyth theym, were in the wood in theyr dysporte and game / the sayde two lordes accompanyed purposely fell vppon hym &amp; slewe hym there and hys wyfe also great wyth chyld, ye which ranne betwene her lord and them, to ye entent to haue sauyd her lord and husbande from the dynt of ye sworde.

                     THE .CXL. CHAPITER.
                     THeodoricus before deposyd / was by the lordes of Fraūce agayne restoryd to hys former dygnyty, in the yere of our lorde .vi. hū
                        dred .lx. and .xi / and the .xxxv. yere of Cadwall forenamed. Therof when Eboryn was warned, he anon drew vnto the kynges presence. By whose fauour &amp; hys owne strength he was

agayne restoryd to his former dignytie &amp; honour / so that he was in lyke authorite as he before tyme had ben.
                     Then he gatheryd to hym great strength, and chasyd Lyndesyle then mayster of the paleys vnto a place named Boccauyle / and shortly after was possessyd of the kynges treasorye. After the which season, this Eboryn faynynge loue and amytye vnto the sayde Lyndesyle, trayterouslye slewe hym. And when Eboryne had thus delyuerid Līdesyle / he thought he myght the better exercyse his olde tyranny and wylfull actes. So that then he exylyd dyuerse prelates and men of the chyrche / and sette in theyr places suche as hym lyked. wherof the nobles of Fraunce beynge aduertysed / and specyally Martyne and Pepyn two of the most nobles of the regyon: they called to them assystēce to wythstande the tyrannye of Eboryne / the whyche yf yt myghte be so sufferyd, shulde destroye the comonwele of the lande. Then this Pepyn (whyche after the rehersayle before made in the .C. and .xxxii. chapyter, shulde be the seconde of that name, and surnamed Uetulus and Breuis / also yet by conuenyency of the tyme to me yt semeth to be one man that ruled in the tyme of Dagobert and nowe, all be yt the frenche cronycle meaneth two sondry persones) wyth the forenamed Martyne, assembled a great hoste, and gaue batayll vnto the sayde Eboryn. But that was to theyr harme / for the loste they felde, and were coacted to flee, the one to the cytye of Laon, and that other to Austracye.
                     And Eboryne whych amonge vsed his accustomyd treason, vnder dyssymyled loue slew the sayde Martyne, as he before had slayne Lyndesyle.
                     In thys tyme flouryd Harmefreditus a nere kynnesman of the holy byshop Leodegayre, that Eboryn before had martyred, as before is shewyd. The whyche Harmefreditus berynge in mynde the passyon of hys sayde kynnesman / waytyd his tyme, and slewe the sayde Eboryne. After whose deth dyssencyon grewe amōg the Frenche men, for the admyssyon of a mayster of the paleys / all be yt that after the sayde varyaunce one Graccon was chosen and admytted. But yt was longe after that Gyllomarus his sonne, putte hys father from the rule therof. Thys after he hadde a whyle occupyed / he dyed of sodayne deth. After whom succedyd agayne hys father Graccon or Garacon / the whyche also dyed shortely after.
                     Then beganne newe questyons amonge the nobles of Fraūce for this offyce / so that lastely they chase a man of lowe byrth and vnmete to that Rome named Bethayr or Barthayr. But Pepyn whych by all this season was in ye coūtrey of Austracy, and harde of the contrauersies and dyuerse opynyons of the Frenche men / assembled to him a strōge hoste, and spedde hym towarde the kynge / entendynge to haue the rule of hym, rather then suche other that were of lesse authoryte and honoure. wherof the kynge beynge warned / by the prouysyon of Barthayer foresayde, he gatheryd hys armye and mette with Pepyn. And after a sharpe fyghte betwene bothe hostes hadde / Barthayre was slayne and the kyng chasyd / and finally was forced to admyt Pepyn for the mayster and gouernour of his paleys. But for as mych as Pepyn had thē the rule of Austracy, and myght not well ouerse bothe charges / he therfore purueyed vnder hym a substitute named Nordobert, whyle he returned into Austracy or Lorayne. And shortly after dyed the

kynge / when he hadde borne ye name therof by the terme of .xix. yeres / leuynge after hym two sonnes named Clodoueus and Childebertus.
                  
                  
                     Anglia. THE .CXL. CHAPITER.
                     
                        CAdwaladrus that of ye reuerente Beda is named Cedwalla / beganne to aryse and rule the Brytons and also the westsaxons, in the yere of grace vi. hundred .lxxx. and thre / and ye .xii. yere of Theodoricus then kynge of Fraunce / and also the last yere of Kenewinus or Kentwinus then kynge of westsaxon. This of Gaufryde and other authours wyth ye englyshe cronicle is called the sonne of Cedwall. But wyllyam that wrote the actes &amp; dedys of kynges sayth, that he was the sonne of Kenebryght / and descendyd lynyally of the blode of Cerdicꝰ the fyrste kynge of the westsaxons. The which Cadwaladyr or Cedwalla made warre vpon Lothariꝰ kyng of Kent, and destroyed myche of that prouynce / and wan the yle of wyght, and gaue the fourth parte therof vnto saynte wylfryde / in the whyche sayde .iiii. parte were accompted .iii. hundred housholdes.
                     The whyle that Calwaladyr was besyed in one parte of Kent / his brother named Mulkyn wyth a certayn of knyghtes was beseged, and lastely brente in a nother parte therof. In reuengement wherof, Cadwaladyr of new destroyed a more parte of the sayde prouynce.
                     Contynuynge the whyche warre, Lotharius forenamed was woūded and dyed. After whom Edricus was kynge / ye whych reygned but a shorte season.
                     Aboute this tyme saynte Cutbert was byshop of Hogulstald or Durham / &amp; after byshop of Lyndefarn. But lastely he rufusyd that / and became an anker in the yle of Farne, and there dyed. This ile now is called holy ilande.
                     Thē Cadwaladyr made warre vppon Athelwold kynge of Southsaxons or Southsex / and slewe hym in playne batayll, and after made hys prouynce thrall to hym. But thys agreeth not with ye former sayeng rehersyd in the .lxxx. &amp; .xiiii. chapyter of this worke precedynge / where yt is sayde that the kyngdome of Southsaxons enduryd but a hundred .xii. yeres. By whyche reason this Ethelwolde or Athelwolde shulde not at this season be kyng of Southsaxōs. For the terme of a hundred and .xii. yeres was expyrd more then .lxxx. and .viii. yeres before this daye. But ye shall vnderstande yt this forsayde terme of a hundred and .xii. yeres / is ment for the contynuaunce of this kyngedome or they were subdued, and the kynges therof named vnder kynges as this Ethelwold was.
                     Then yt foloweth when Cadwaladyr hadde ruled the Brytons and also the westsaxons, by the terme of thre yeres, as wytnessyth Ranulphe munke of Chester / he then of pure deuocyon renouncyd the pompe and pryde of the worlde, and yode in pylgrymage to Rome / where of the fyrst Sergius then pope, he was confyrmyd and after made a white munke, and contynued there hys lyfe tyme in perfyte holynes.
                     Of thys Cadwaladyr or Cedwalla many and dyuers opynyons are wryten of authours, both of hys reygne and also of the contynuaunce therof / and ouer that, of the tyme whē he forsoke hys lande. wherin is great varyaunce, as I haue shewed

in the table in the begynnyng of this symple worke. So that it shuld seme that these two names shulde sounde to be sondry persones / wherof the cō
                        trary is a certayned by the foresayde Ranulphe / where as he sayeth that Cadwaladrꝰ or Cedwalla was but one persone, the whyche was laste kyng of Britons and of westsaxons. Also for so mych as they ioyned next vnto Cambria or walys.
                     If I shuld here bryng in the cause of the auoydynge of thys lande by Cadwaladyr, as is rehersyd by Gaufryde / yt wolde aske a longe tracte of tyme / and also to me yt apperyth the more doutefull, that yt is not testyfyed of the authour of Policronycon / consyderynge the great nomber of authours, whyche he sought and allegyd for his authoryte, as yt shewyth in the fyrste chapyter of his fyrst boke. And specyally syns that holy Gyldas and Bede is amonge the sayde authours accomptyd / ye whych dyd great dilygence in serchynge of the dedes and actes of the Brytons / and of the aungellis monycyon that to hym was geuen / with also the prophecye of Merlyn, that the Brytons shulde not recouer this lande tyll the relykes of Cadwaladyr wyth other of holy saintes, were brought hyther out of Rome. I hold that for no part of my beleue though many welshemen yt do. wherfore to folowe the moste authoryte as before is sayde / when this Cadwaladyr had reygned thre yeres, he went to Rome / &amp; there lastely dyed, and was buryed in the chyrche of saynt Peter, with this epythaphye or superscrypcyon vppon his toumbe, as foloweth in metyr,

                           Culmen opus sobolem pollencia regna triumphos,
                           Eximias proceros moenia castra lares,
                           Quae
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               patrum virtus, &amp; quae congesserat ipse.
                           Cadwald armipotens, linquit amore dei.
                        
The whyche versys may be englysshed in maner as foloweth.

                           worshypfull ryches, kynred, triumphes assuryd,
                           Plenteous welth, wyth clothes rychly dyghte,
                           Houses, castellys, and townes strōgly muryd,
                           And other honours whyche by hys parentes myght / 
                           And his ownes this marcyall vertuous knyghte,
                           Cadwalde the stronge, descendyd of kynges bloode,
                           For Crystes loue renouncyd all hys good.
                        
And thus here endeth the lyfe &amp; rule of the Brytons nowe called welshemen / whych toke that name of theyr duke or leder as sayth Guydo called wallo or Guallo / or ellys of a quene of walys named Galaes or walaes. But how so ye name came first to thē, onw are they called welshe mē, yt somtyme were named Brytons or Brutons, descendyd fyrste of Troyans, and after of Brute, &amp; lastely of Dū
                        wallo Moliuncius or Molmucius Dūwallo. All be yt they were gretly mynglyd or medelyd wyth other nacyōs, as Romayns, Pictes, &amp; other / as by the redyng of the premisses ye may wel perceyue &amp; know. And now be they englyshe, that in theyr begynnyng were named Saxōs or Anglis
                     But yet for so myche as welchmē extolle so hougely theyr blode &amp; allyaūce, fetchyng yt frō Pryam but not from Eneas, &amp; regarded so lytle the progeny or lynyall descent of ye Saxōs or Anglis: therfore to ye entēt to kele somwhat theyr hygh corage, or to opp̄sse in ꝑty their brutyshe blastꝭ, I will bryng in here ye sayng of Guydo &amp; other, ye auaūce the blode or dyssent of the Saxōs to be farre aboue the Britons / as they yt ar descendyd of goddes &amp; men immortall / where

the Britons clayme the ofsprynge to come of men they were mortall / &amp; not moste to be alowed in honour, yf they thynke vppon Eneas vntrouth and treason.
                     Then to folowe the foresayde authour Guydo, that sayth. woden, of whom the Saxons taken theyr orygynall, was ye sonne of Frealoffe the sonne of Fredewolfe, the sonne of Flyn, the son of Flokwald, the son of Geta, that was the sonne of Minos, that is nexte in honour to Pluto god of hell, and chefe iudge of his infernall iurisdyccyon.
                     Therfore ye welshe men here after nurture lere.
                     And dyspyse not Saxōs that ben to god so nere.
                     Thus then apperyth by the conueyaunce of this worke, yt the last or thyrd yere of Cadwaldyr was ye yere of grace .vi. hundred .lxxx. &amp; vi. which maketh the yere of ye worlde .v. thousand .viii. hūdred .lxxx. &amp; .v. By which reason yt apperyth, that the Britons had the rule of this land for the more party, to reken frō the fyrst cōmynge of the duke or leader Brute, by the space of a thousande .viii. hundred &amp; xxii. yeres.
                     And thus here an ende of the fyfte parte of this worke, for the consyderacyon before rehersyd, that Briton kynges after this day, reygned none in this realme / and the Saxons or Anglis began fully to haue domynyon therof.
                     wherfore as before tyme I haue vsed and done in the other parties before specyfyed, so now I here agayn salute and gyue thankes to that moste excellēt virgyn our lady saynt Mary, with the .v. ioyes of the forenamed seuen ioyes, begynnynge.

                  THE SEXTE PARTE.
                  After that Cadwaladyr was thus departyd ye londe / as some authours meane, this lande of Brytayne was in great dyscensyon, by meane of the Brytons and Saxons, by the terme of a .xi. yeres. And ouer that the mortalyte before spoken of encreasyd so hugely, and therewyth great hunger &amp; famyne ouer sprad the lande / that by occasion of one and other the people of this realme was wonderfully mynyshed &amp; lassed / so ferforthly that as wytnessyth Gaufryde &amp; also the englyshe cronycle, the quycke bodyes suffysed not to bury ye ded. But in so mych as of this spekyth not the mūke of Chester nor other authours as before is shewyd in the forsayde table, the whych I remytte to the correccyon of such as be lerned / and not onely to englyshe reders as there is fortherly declaryd: I therfore, as before is sayd folow the sayd Ranulph mūke of Chester / where he sayth that Iewe or Iue was kynge of westsaxons

next after ye forenamed Cadwaladyr. The whych I shall fyrst shew the story of, and so of the successours of hym in that kyngedome, for that that they subdued lastly all the other kyngedomes / and somdeale touche of the other kyngdomes or lordshyppes as tyme conuenyente shall requyre / in expressynge of the storyes of the sayd westsaxon kynges, tyll the lande be brought agayne to one monarchye.
                  And for the dyuysyon of the sayde kyngdomes stande somdeale farte asonder / so that to the reders yt were somwhat paynfull to serche for eueryche of them: I therfore haue sette them out in the compasse folowyng, that yt maye appere to the reder the begynnynge of eueryche of theym / and howe longe a season or tyme eyther of the sayde kyngdomes contynued or enduryd / the names also of euery kyngdome / and in what parte of thys lande euery lordshyp was stablyshed for the tyme and sette.
                  
                     THE .CXLI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        IUe or Iewe discendyd of the blode of Saxons / was ruler or kyng of westsaxons, nexte after that ye forenamed Cadwaladyr had renounced the pompe of the worlde. The whyche to folowe the opynyon of Policronicon, began hys reygne the yere of grace .vi. hundred .lxxx. &amp; vii, and the .xvi. yere of the seconde Theodoricus then kynge of Fraūce / and ruled the westsaxons knyghtly, and maynteyned such warre agayn the Kentyshe Saxons, yt the men of Dorobernia or Caunterbury grauntyd vnto hym to haue peace. And also for a recompensement of the deth of Mulkynge brother to Cadwaladyr before slayne, as is shewed in the precedynge chapyter by the sayde Kentyshe Saxons / they gaue vnto hym for the sayd consyderacyōs thre thousande pounde.
                     About ye yere of the reygne of Iue / the holy man Cutlake about ye .xxiiii. yere of his age, renouncyd the pōpe and pryde of this worlde / and toke ye order of munkes in the abbay of Repyndon. And the .iii. yere after he wēt to Crowlande / and there lad for the whyle an holy Ankers lyfe, and dyd there many myracles, and there fynally was buryed.
                     In whyche yle and place of hys buryenge standeth nowe a fayre abbay, the whyche for the greate resorte of gestes that thyther drawyth, and for the good and frendely chere that gestes there receyue and take / the sayd place hath purchasyd a surname and is named Crowlande the curteys / the whyche is a place of good fame. And there lyeth also the holy confessoure Neotus, somtyme dyscyple of Erkenwalde byshoppe of London.
                     In the .xi. yere of the reygne of Iue, befell the wounder and meruayle that ys tolde of Bryghtwaldus / the whyche after he hadde ben a longe whyle ded, was restoryd to lyfe agayne, and tolde many thynges of great wonder to many men / whereby he causyd great almys, and many other dedes of charyte to be executyd.
                     And after the dysposycyon of hys owne goodes, by the agremēt of his wyfe he went vnto ye abbay of Maylroos / and there in great holynes contynued the resydue of his lyfe.
                     About the .xvi. yere of the reygne of Iue / Etheldredus before mynded in the .C. &amp; xxxv. chapiter kyng of Mercia, forsoke this wordly honour, and

became a munke at Bardeney / when he hadde longe tyme rulyd the men of Mercia or myddell Anglys. Hys brother Kenredus was kynge after hym / the whych also after he had reygned fyue yeres, lefte his kyngdome vnto Colredus the sonne of hys vncle / and he wyth Offa the sonne of Iue now kynge of westsaxons, and wyth Egwinus byshop of wykcies or of wyke, whych see is now at worceter / wyth thys forsayde companye this Kenredus yode vnto Rome in pilgrimage and there endyd his life.
                     And aboute the .xviii. yere of the reygne of Iue dyed the holy byshop Aldelme, whyche fyrste was munke and abbot of Malmesbury, and the laste byshoppe. Of hym yt is writen, that when he was styryd by his gostly enymy to the synne of the fleshe / he to do the more torment to hym selfe and of hys body / wolde holde within his bedde by hym a fayre mayden, by so longe tyme as he myght say ouer the hole sauter / all be yt that such holynesse is no artycle of saynt Benettis lore, yor yet for dyuerse inconuenyence moste alowyd by holy doctours. And amonge many of his vertuous &amp; holy dedys / Ranulph mūke of Chester she with, that for the same of hys holynes sprange wyde, Sergius the fyrste of that name beynge pope, sente for hym to Rome. In whyche season of his there beynge / the sayde Sergius was accusyd or defamed of the gettynge of a chylde, the whyche the .ix. daye of the sayde chyldes age, was brought to holy Aldelme to be crystyned. By vertue of whose prayer, the sayde chylde answered vnto certayn questyons, and cleryd the pope of that cryme yt was before put vppon hym.
                     Nere about the .xxiii. yere of Iue / Colredus then kynge of Mercia, for cause of variaunce betwene him and Ine vnremembred of myn authour, assembled hys knyghtes, and began to warre vppon hym. wherof ye other hauynge knowlege, in lykewyse gatheryd his power / and lastely met to both theyr harmes, at a place called wodynsburgth. where after longe fyght eyther of them sped so vnhappely, that yt was not knowen whether hoste hadde moste domage.
                     And nere about ye .xxv. yere of Iue, as wytnessyth holy Beda / saynte Iohan of Beuerlay that then was bysshoppe of yorke, dyed / and was buryed in the porche of the mynster of Deyrwood or Beuerlay. Thē Iewe or Iue callynge to mynde the counsayll of holy Aldelme, yt beforetyme had coūsaylyd hym to buylde an abbay at Glastenbury / began the sayd worke about the .xxxii. yere of his reygne / and founded there an abbaye, the whyche contynued prosperously tyll ye comynge of ye Danis / by whose cruelty yt was then sore blemyshed. But afterward by the helpe of saynt Dunstane, in the tymes of Edmond and Edgare, yt was agayne suffycyently repayred, &amp; so cōtynued tyll the comyng of the Normās / after which season yt was agayne besette wyth hard happes. But now at this daye yt standeth a place of great welthe and honour.
                     Then yt folowyth, when Iue had ruled the westsaxons nobly by the terme of .xxxvii. yeres / by the assyduate labour of hys holy wyfe Ethelburga, as she that longe had laboured hym to leue the world and coude not brynge about her purpose / vpon a season when the kyng and she had restyd them in a fayre paleys rychely behanged, and were vpon the morne thens departed, she by her commaundement caused the sayd paleys to be replenysshyd wyth all kynd of fylth and dunge / and hogges and vyle bestes

there in to be layde, as well in ye chambers as other houses of offyce. And when she knewe that thys paleys was thus deformyd / she besought the kynge to vysyte the sayde paleys. And when she had broughte hym therunto, she sayde to hym: I praye you my lorde behold now this house. where are now the ryche tappets and clothes of gold and of silke and other ryche apparell that we left here thys other daye. And where be the delyces and plesaunt seruytours and costly dyshes, that you and I lately were seruyd wyth. Be not all these passyd and gone? My lorde in lyke maner shall we passe and sodenly, as ye se these worldely thynges ben passyd. And oure bodyes whych now ben delycately kepyd / shall fall and turne into fylth of ye erthe. wherfore haue in mynde my wordes that before this tyme to you I haue often shewyd &amp; told / and busy you to purchase that paleys ye euer shal endure in ioy wythout transmutacyon.
                     By meane of these wordes &amp; other / the quene turnyd so ye kynges mynd, that shortly after he resygned the gouernaunce of his kyngdome vnto Ethellardus his neuewe / &amp; he for the loue of Cryste toke vpon hym the habyte of a poore man / and settynge a parte all pompe and pryde of thys worlde, accompanyed hym in the felowshyp of poore men, and yode vnto Rome in pylgrymage wyth great deuocyon, when he hadde ben kynge of the westsaxons, as before is sayde xxxvii. yeres. After whose departyng the foresayde Etheldreda hys wyfe went vnto barkynge .vii. mylys frō London / where in the abbay before of Erkenwalde foundyd, she contynued and ended an holy lyfe, whē she hadde ben abbesse of the same place a certayn of tyme. It is sayd &amp; testifyed of wyllyam wryter of kynges, that this Iue was the fyrste kynge that grauntyd a peny of euery fyre house thorow this realm to be payed to the courte of Rome, whych at this daye is called Rome stote or Peter pens, and yet is payed in many places of Englande. But why yt was graunted the cause is not here shewed, how be it yt shall be shewyd after.

The whyche was vnder the rule of Plectrude the wyfe of Pepyn than dede, and of Theodowald than mayster of the paleys. Thys Plectrude as before is shewed was stepmother to Charlys sonne of Pepyn and of Alpayde, wherfore she berynge malyce to the sayd Charlys, caused hym to be holden as prysoner wythin Coleyne, where he so as prysoner remaynynge / the foresayd Theoldowalde exercysed suche tyrannys, and putte vpon the people suche exaccyons, ye dyscensyon grewe bytwene hym and the lordes of Fraūce, so that dyuers cōflyctes and skyrmysshes were had amonge the nobles of Fraunce / for partyes were taken vpon eyther sydes, whereby the kynges partye at length was wekyd.

                     Thus as testyfyeth mayster Robert Gagwyne and also the Frenche cronycle, was a preste or clerke / and

for his wysedome was cherysshed before tyme in the kynges paleys / in ye whyche tyme and season he sufferyd hys crowne to be ouer growen. Or ellys after Antoninus, this Danyell after ye deth of Dagobert, for so mych as he lefte after hym none of ye royall blode / the Frenchemen supposynge hym to be apte for ye rule of the lond, for suche experyence as before tyme in hym had be proued / kepte hym secrete a certeyne of tyme tyll his heyre was fully growen / and than declared hym to be the brother of Dagobert, and chaungyd hys name / and called hym Chylperych / &amp; so by one assente admytted hym for kynge of Fraunce.
                     Charles before spoken of sonne of Pepyn, beynge escapyd the daunger of prysonement / sought and compassyd by all maner of wayes, how he myghte obteyne the rome that sometyme hys fader occupyed. And thys to brynge to effecte / he purchasyd to hym a yonglynge of fayre &amp; goodly maners &amp; stature named Clothayre, and sayd that he was descendyd of ye royall blode of Fraunce / by meane wherof in shorte tyme he gaderyd to hym greate strength. wherof heryng Chylperych / commaunded Rangafrede to assemble hys knyghtes to wythstōde the purpose of Charlys. And soone after bothe hostes mette, nere vnto the forenamed ryuer of Mense / where was foughte a strong and cruell batayle / of ye whych Rangafrede was vyctor, and compellyd Charles to forsake the felde. But he shortly afterward assemblyd and gaderyd agayne togyder all suche as before were dysperklyd / and fought efte wyth the sayde Rangafrede at a Place called Ablane. Of the whyche batayle wyth great dyffyculte Charlys was lastly wyctour / and chasyd Rangafrede, and hys hoste greatly demynysshed &amp; lassyd. Than thyrdly these two hostes met in a felde called the wyne felde / where also was present the sayd Danyell or Chilperych hauynge in hys ayde amonge other prynces the duke of Gascoyne / and there fought a sore &amp; cruell batayle. wherof lastly was vyctor the sayde Charlys / and constrayned the kyng wyth the sayde duke to fle vnto Orleaunce. where they takynge wyth them suche treasoure as belonged to the kynge / fled from thens vnto the Duchye of Gascoyne.
                     whan Charlys conceyued that the kynge was escapyd hys daunger, &amp; knewe that Raganfrede was in the cyty of Aungiēs / he sped him thether in all haste: and compassyd the citye wyth so stronge a syege, that fynally he obteyned the cytye wyth all that was therin. But it was not longe after that Charlys shewed vnto Ragā
                        frede suche benyuolence, that he was set at hys lyberte and fredome.
                     The next yere folowyng the duke of Gascoyn before mynded, hauyng parfyte informacyon by ambassade or otherwyse / that Charlys entēdyd to make sharpe &amp; cruell warre vpon the Gascoynes, for that that they fauouryd and kepte wyth them Danyell or Chilperych / he in auoydyng the sayde daūger of warre, in shorte tyme after sent vnto Charlys, vnder certayne condycyons bytwene them agreed, the sayd Chylperyche / wyth al such treasour &amp; iewellys as to him or the crowne of Fraunce belongyd.
                     In thys passetyme &amp; season dyed the forenamed Clothayre, that Charles before had made kyng. wherfore to the more restfulnesse of ye realme, he allowed the forenamed Chylperyche for kyng / and he as mayster of the kynges paleys, as other his predecessours, ruled the land of Fraūce. Than Charlys hauynge thus the

rule and gouernaunce / ruled it well and substancyally, and defended yt from all enemyes durynge the lyfe of the sayd Chylperyche. And after the whych / Chylperych whan he had contynued as kynge by the terme of v. yeres dyed / and was buryed, as sayth the Frenche cronycle in ye citye of Noen or Noyen / wythout issue of hys body.

The which was from hys yonge and tender age fosteryd and norysshed in a house of nonnys in womans clothynge / and lastly espyed, and by cōsent of Charlys mayster of the paleys admytted for kynge.
                     After the whych solempnyte fynysshed / Charlys herynge of the rebellyon of a people called the Sweuys or Swetesers / assembled an hoste, &amp; lastly them subdued. whyche done / he turned hym toward an other part of the Almaynes, and in lyke wyse ouercame them / and after retourned into Fraunce wyth greate tryumphe and ryches, that he hadde wonne at

those two iourneyes.
                     It was not longe afterward, that Charlys had thus subdued the foresayde people of Almayne, wyth also a greate parte of Germany / but that tydyng came to hym, yt Endo duke of Gascoyne rebelled agayne ye kyng of Fraūce. wherfore he in all goodly haste preparyd hys armye, and sped hym into Gascoyne / where he made so cruell warre, that he in short tyme damagyd greatly the countrey / and held the duke Endo so streyte, that he was compellyd to hyde hym in secrete places of the countreye / where after greate serche he myghte not be founde, wherfore he settynge the coū
                        trey in some restfulnesse, retourned hym into Fraunce.
                     whan Endo was sure of the retourne of Charlys into Fraunce / for so mych as he had prouyd the marcyall knyghthode of hym, and knew well he myghte not hym selfe wythstand hys knyghtly power / he therefore allyed hym wyth the kynge of Spayne than beyng a pagan or myscreaunt and named Abyderamus, and excyted and styred hym to make warre vppon the lande of Fraunce / promysynge to hym not all onely vyctory, but also that londe to hym and to hys heyres for euer.

And what they wan, they enioyed it as theyr owne. And so in processe came vnto the cytye of Burdeaux / the whych after a certayne tyme of ye cytesens defendyd, the sayde myscreaūtes wan into theyr possessyon, and dystroyed the people thereof, with all theyr chyrches and temples of the same. And from thens passyng the countreye in wastynge it wyth iron and wyth fyre, lastly came vnto Poytiers. whyche cytye as before ye haue harde in the story of the fyrste Dagoberte in the .C. and .xxxii. chapyter, was by hym subuertyd / and at thys daye newely reedyfyed.
                     Thys cytye also of them possessyd / they in lyke maner as they had dalte wyth Burdeaux, so dyd they wyth thys / not sparynge that holy place of saynt Hyllary, but dyd vnto yt greate shame &amp; vylany. And from thens they yode vnto Towers / wastynge and sleynge the people wythout mercy by all the waye that they passyd, and wasted that cytye as they had done the other.
                     In the whyche passetyme Charlys herynge of the cruelte of this Arbideramus / assembled hys power, and shortly met with hym nere vnto Towers. where he bare hym so knyghtely / that he slewe of the Paganys to excedynge a nomber to be accordaunt wyth reason. But for I se it testyfyed of so many wryters yt boldeth me to expresse the nomber / whyche was .iii. hundred .iiii. score and .v. thousande and odde. And of the Frenchemen were slayne but .xv. hundred onely.
                     For the whyche vyctoryous acte / the sayde Charlys obteyned a surname, and was called after that day Carolus Martellus, the whyche is to meane Charles the hamer. For lyke as the hamer maketh all metallys plyable / so Charlys made hys foes or enemies pliable to his hestis. And as the hamer cutteth, breketh, or dysseueryth iron and other harde metallys / so dyd thys Charlys dysmēber &amp; cut or breke the enemyes of Fraūce thorough his high prowesse.
                     
                        It is shewyd in the bokes called Cronica cronicarum, Supplementum cronicarum, Policronica, and other / that this vyctory was obteyned by Charlis of the Sarasins, but not as inhabytauns or incolers of Spayne / but that they were yssuyd out of Africa, and then warryd and hadde wonne great countreys in Spayne. The whyche is more accordaunt wyth hystoryes. For in the plegys or rehersayllys of the names of kynges of Spayne, I fynde no kynge of that name. Then yt foloweth in the story / when Charlis Martell hadde thus obteyned vyctory, he cōmaūded all ye pillage to be brought to one place. That done, he deuyded it amonge hys knyghtes. And shortly after Endo knowlegynge hys offence, and sekyng meanes of mercy / was agayne restoryd to the lande of Gascoyne.

                        cylyd / sent hym wyth a certayne of knyghtes agayn the reste of the sayd Sarazyns / the whyche by hys man hode he oppressyd and subdued, and clerely voydyd the lande of theym. Then soone vpon this beganne the Burgonyons to rebelle / and made sharpe warre vpon the Frenchemen nexte adioynaunte to them, and dyd vnto the countrey and inhabitaūtes of the same great harme. The which warre / the sayde Martell that therin toke great payne, not without great payne, lastely yt appeasyd and them subduyd.
                     In tyme of the whyche warre so contynuynge / Endo before rehersyd duke of Gascoyne dyed. wherfore Charlis to sette that prouynce in an order and due obeysaunce, yode thether. where he beynge busyed about the nedes of the same / tydynges to hym were broughte that the wandalys which ben of the kynde or lynage of the Hunys before touched, hadde entred the land wyth an houge power and in wastynge the countrey, approchyd ye citye of Senōs or Sens, and yt enuyroned or beclypped wyth a stronge syege. But by the vertue and strength of the archbyshop of ye cytye named Ebe, Ebbe, or Obbo, wyth the assystence of the cytezyns of the same / the sayde cytye was defendyd and delyueryd from the power of the fayde wandalys / &amp; the power of them abbatyd and subduyd.
                     For these manyfolde incurcyons and assautys of enymyes, and rebellyon of the countrees that were subiecte to the crowne of Fraunce / the treasour of Fraunce, &amp; specyally of ye temporall people was sore minyshed and wastyd. wherfore in defence of all the lande / Charlis Martell made requeste to the spirituall men / &amp; with great dyffyculte hadde yt graunted, that he myght leuy certayne dymys to wage therwith soudyours, &amp; prepayre other necessaryes for ye warre. Thys after the opinyon of some writers, was the fyrste tyme that euery spirytuall mannes money wythin ye realme was occupyed to temporall vse. wherfore as yt is reported of dyuerse cronyclars / the sayde Charlis when he was ded, was sene by the byshoppe of Orleaunce named Ethereus, to be in great payne and tourment.
                     Then Charlis moued his hoste towarde the Burgonyons, that agayn were of newe styred and exhortyd by dyuerse persones to newe rebellyon. And after his comynge thyther, dyd execucyon vppon suche persons as he founde culpable / and not without batayll, sette the country agayne in

quyet / &amp; then retourned into Fraūce.
                     But he rested not longe there, or he harde worde that the Almaynes, whyche dwellyd ouer or beyonde the ryuer called the Ryne / brake ouer in to Fraunce. These people are named in ye Frenche boke Sesues / ye which dyd great domage vpon the countreys adioynynge to the sayde ryuer. But yt was not long after, or he had theym chasyd and subduyd / wyth al so an nother people called the Hunis or Gothys, that he before hadde also vaynquyshed. The whych after this seconde scōfyture / they assocyat vnto theym the kinge of Longobardes namyd Luytprandus. By whose assystens and power, the forsayde Gothis wan the citye of Auygnon and other stronge holdes, to the great hurte of the Frenche men.
                     And for at this season Charlis was greued wyth sykenesse / he therfore sent his brother named Chyldebert to wythstande the sayde enymyes / ye whyche bare hym so manfully, that he chasyd the sayde enymyes.
                     But thys saynge dyscordyth wyth other authours, whyche shewen that betwene this Charlis and Luytprandus was contynuall amyte &amp; frendshyppe / in so myche that Luytprandus ayded &amp; assysted the sayde Charlis to auoyde ye Sarasins that were entryd a countrey of Fraunce called then Gallia cisalpina.
                     In this tyme that Fraunce was thus wrapped in these harde happes and batayllys / dyed the kyng Theodoricus, when he hadde occupied the name onely of a kynge .xiiii. yeres.

                     CUtbertus the neuew of Ethelardꝰ / began his reygne ouer ye westsaxōs, in the yere of grace .vii. hūdred &amp; .xxix / and the thyrde yere of the seconde Theodoricus then kyng of Fraunce. In tyme of whose reygn Colwolphus reygned in Northumberland / to whome as before in the story of Ethelarde is touched, holy Beda wrote the story called Historia Anglicana. About the .ii. yere of the reygne of this Cutberte apperyd in the fyrmament .ii. blasynge starrys or .ii. starris wyth crestes / &amp; caste as yt were brennynge brondes towarde the Northe.
                     And about the .vi. yere of the reygn of Cutbert dyed the foresayde holy Beda / the which in his tyme made &amp; wrote .lxxviii. bokes, ouer and besyde his manyfold workes of vertue that he vsyd by all his lyfe tyme. It ys told of hym, that in his later dayes when he was blynd, he was brought by ye frawde of his leder vnto a great hepe of stonys / the whych his leder shewyd to hym was an assemble of men and women, that were thether comyn to here hym preache the word of god. Then he thynkynge hys reporte to be true / anon wyth great deuocyon beganne there a collacyon. And therof when he came to the ende the stonys by dyuyne power, in lykenesse of a great multytude of people sayd Amen / or after the sayng of Antoninus, Deo gratias.
                     He was so noble of lernynge and excellent in connynge / that the fyrste Sergius pope of Rome sent for him to assoyle q̄styons there made in the popes vniuersyte. Also his connyng is apparent in the bokes whyche he wrote super Genesim, super Thobiam, super Esdriam, suꝑ Neemiam, wyth other, whyche wolde aske a longe tracte of tyme to reherse, wyth also the omelies made vppon the gospellys / but I passe ouer▪ when he was dede / he was buryed at ye abbay of Gyruy / all be yt the comynyng is

that he restyth now wyth saynte Cutbert of Durham. About the .ix. yere of this kynges reygne / the holy vyrgyne saynt Fredeswide dyed. Of her yt is sayde, for vylanye that to her shulde haue ben done, by a kynge in Oxynford / that kynges of England at the seasons syns haue sparyd to entre that towne for drede of myshappe. who so wyll knowe the cyrcū

                     Thus for as mych as lytle is shewyd of the dedis of Cutbert kynge of westsaxons, therfore I haue made the more rehersayll of other chynges done in his tyme. For of hym is nothynge lefte in wrytynge worthy to be remembryd or mynded / sauynge that he often and many tymes made warre vppon Ethelwalde kynge of Mercia and spedde therin diuersly / &amp; lastely dyed when he had reygned after moste wryters .xvi. yeres.

                        HIldericꝰ or Childericus ye second of that name, &amp; sonne of Theodoricus / began his reygne ouer the Frenshemen in ye yere of our lordes incarnacyon .vii. hūdred and xl / and the .xi. yere of Cutbertus then kynge of westsaxons. Of the whych for his dulnesse and hys other enormytes in hym exercysed / lytle or no thynge of his actes or dedes are put in memorye.
                     ye haue before in the story of Theodoryche, harde of the puyssaunt and stronge dedys of Charlis Martell / the whyche styll durynge his lyfe, cōtynued in great honour, to the great suertye of the realme of Fraūce, and to the great terrour and fere of theyr enymyes / wherof to reherse all the cyrcumstaunce yt wolde occupye a longe tyme. wherfore shortely to conclude / lastely after hys manyfolde trauayllys susteyned for the weale of the realme of Fraunce, he dyed / leuynge after hym thre sonnes, that is to wytte Charlemayne, Pepyn, and Gryffon / to the whyche he bequethed his possessions and goodes. But for the yongest named Gryffon helde hym not contentyd wyth suche bequest as hys father to hym gaue / he therfore made warre vppon hys other two bretherne. The whyche behaued theym so wysely / that wythout notable batayll, they toke theyr sayde brother, and putte hym in a safe kepynge. And that done / the sayde two bretherne assemblyd theyr knyghtes, and spedde theym agayn Hanualde duke of Guyan, then rebellyng agayn the crown of Fraūce. The whych duke with the countrey, they brought vnder theyr fyrste obeysaunce. After the whyche victorye of the sayde coūtrey obteyned, the sayd two bretherne spedde them to the cytye of Poytyers, where they by aduyse of the nobles of the lande, consyderynge the vnablenesse of Hilderyche ye kynge, that he was vnsuffycyent to rule so great a charge / dyuyded the lande of Fraunce betwene theym. So that eyther of them shuld

vnder the kynge, rule and gouerne suche porcyon as then there was to them appoynted.
                     After the whyche porcyon Charlmayne herynge of the dyuysyon and stryfe amonge the Almaynes / as thynge belongynge to hys charge, spedde hym thyther in all haste. And after a parte of that countrey wastyd and spoylyd / and dyuerse of theyr stronge holdys caste playne wyth the erthe / he brought theym to due subieccyon.
                     And soone after he went agayne the Bauarys / ye whyche by his knyghtely strength, he appeased in lykewyse. In all whyche tyme and season / Pepyn hys brother was occupyed in defendynge of the other partyes of Fraunce.
                     Then this foresayde Charlmayne steryd by dyuyne inspyracyon, or as some authours meane, as he before tyme hadde auowyd / sodeynely renouncyd and gaue ouer all worldely prosperyte and domynyon, and with pure deuocyon yode to Rome. where of the pope then named zacharias / he wyth all honour and ioy was receyuyd, and of hym shorne a munke, and dwelled a season in an abbaye of hym selfe buylded in the mounte Sarapte. But for he sawe that dayly drewe to hym many great lordes of Fraunce / by meane wherof he was lette from hys dyuyne seruyce and contemplacyon: he therfore yode thens to the mounte Cassyne, &amp; there endyd his naturall lyfe.
                     After whose thus departynge or gyuynge ouer of the sayde Charlemayne / Pepyn as onely ruler, toke vppon hym the charge of the hole realme.
                     In thys passe tyme Gryffon the yonger brother was enlargyd from prysone / and by fauoure of hys bretherne was assygned to suche possessyons, as to hym was demed suffycyent to lede an honorable lyfe.
                     How be yt when he sawe that hys brother Pepyn hadde all the rule and he nothynge: he dysdayned hys sayde brother / and thoughte no lenger to contynue in that maner, but to be partener of the rule of the lande as Charlemayne hys brother hadde ben. And this to brynge to hys purpose, he fledde vnto the Saxons, whyche as after shall appere were named Normans. And with the prynce of theym made alyaunce / so that wyth theyr ayde he mouyd warre agayne his brother, and assembled a stronge hoste. wherof Pepyn beynge warnyd, gaderyd hys people / and passynge thorow came to the ryuer of Sunaha, or after the latyne tonge Smussaha / and Gryffon sped hym tyll he came to a ryuer called Onacre.
                     whē these .ii. hostes were thus nere, meanes of treatye were soughte on both partyes. Durynge whych communycacyon / Gryffon hauynge susspeccyon to the Saxons that were on his parte, leste they wold betraye hym and yelde hym into the handes of his brother, made for that tyme a sleyght agrement / and shortly after departyd from the sayd Saxōs, and fled to the Bauarys or into Bayon. where he allyeng hym wyth dyuerse nobles and barons of Fraunce / vexyd and distourbed sore the duke and lorde of that countrey called Tassylon / and lastly dysceasyd hym of that lordshyppe. wherof Pepyn beynge warned, spedde hym thyther wyth great strength / and so bare hym that he had the better of his brother, and restoryd the sayd Tassylon vnto his right / &amp; after retourned into Fraūce, ledynge wyth hym his brother Gryffon as his prysoner.
                     But ye was not long after, that by

medyatours the sayde Gryffon was reconcilyd to his brother. And for he shuld be cōtent &amp; haue no more cause to vary with his broder, there was assygned to hym, as wytnessyth ye frēch cronicle and other, xii. erldomes with in the realme of Fraunce. wyth the whyche bounteous gyfte he not beynge cōtente / the selfe same yere fled vnto ye duke of Guyan named Gayffer / and wyth hym newly conspyred agayne his sayde brother. But lastely he was there slayne as after shall appere.
                     Pepyn then consyderynge in hys mynde in what daunger and trouble hys father before hym had ruled the lande, &amp; he now for his tyme in lyke agony and trouble / and the kynge, to whome belonged all the charge, kepte hys paleys &amp; folowed all his delytes and pleasures, wythoute takynge of any payne / wherfore consyderynge the premysses, &amp; for a reformacyon of the same: sent hys ambassade to the pope then beynge zacharye before named, askyng hys aduyse, whether yt was more necessary or welfull for the realme of Fraūce that he shulde be admytted for kyng that dyd nothynge but applye hys mynde to all pleasure of hys bodye, wythout cure or charge takynge vppon hym for the guydynge of the lande and the people of the same / or he that toke upon him all the charge and payne, in defence of the lande, and kepynge of the people in due subieccyon. To this the pope answeryd and wrote vnto Pepyn, that he was beste worthy and moste profytable for the realme to be admyttyd for kynge, that ruled well the comynaltye by iustyce and prudence, and the enymyes therof defendyth and subdueth by his polycy and manhode. The whyche answere thus receyued frome the pope, and declared vnto the lordes and barons of the realme: anone they of one assente and mynde procedyd and went to the deposynge and puttynge downe of theyr kynge and gouernour Hylderyche. And in shorte space after closyd hym in a monastery or house of relygyon, when he hadde ben occupyer of a kynges rome by the name onely .x. yeres. And that done, the Frenche men electyd and chase Pepyn for theyr souerayne and kynge.
                     In the whyche Hilderyche or Childerych endyd the lyfe or progeny of Meroneus / of whome the Frenche kynges lynyally descendyd by contynuaunce of tyme as foloweth.

                        SIgebertꝰ or Sigbertus the cosyne of Cutbert laste kynge of the westsaxons / beganne his reygne ouer ye sayd Saxons, in the yeres of ye incarnacyon

of Cryst .vii. hūdred and xlv / and the .v. yere of Hildericꝰ then kyng of Fraunce. He was cruell and tyrannous to his subiectes / &amp; turnyd theyr lawes and customes of his fore fathers after his owne wyll and pleasure. And for ye one of the noble men of his dominyon somdele sharply aduertysed him to chaūge his maners, and to behaue hym more prudently towarde his pleople / he therfore malycyously caused hym to be putte to cruell deth.
                     About this tyme Egbertus, after the yonger wylfryde, was made archbyshoppe of yorke. The whyche brought agayn thyther the pall that his predecessours hadde forgone, syns the tyme that the fyrst Paulinꝰ had lefte that see and fled to Rochester in Kent, and there lefte the sayd pall. This Egbert was brother vnto Egbert kyng of Northumberlād / by whose assystence and comforte, he dyd many thynges for the weale of ye see, &amp; made there a noble library.
                     Then yt folowyth, for so myche as the kyng Sygebert contynued in his malyce &amp; cruell condycyons / his subiectes conspired agayn hym, and putte hym from all kyngely dygnyte. So yt he fell after to great desolacyon &amp; mysery / in such wyse yt he was founden after in a wood or desolate place wandryng alone without cōforte. where he beyng so foundē by a swyne herd or vylayne, some tyme belongyng to the erle Cōbranꝰ yt he before tyme wyckydly had slayn / in auengement of his sayd lordes deth slew hym in ye sayd place. which sayd Sigebertus was thus depryued frō al houour / whē he after most writers had reygned or tyrannysed .ii. yeres.

The vertue of thys man passyd his fame. For after he hadde with the agrement of the westsaxons depryued Sygebert theyr kynge frō his authorite and regally / he fyrst appeasyd dyuers murmurs and grudgis that kyndelyd among his subiectes / &amp; set his lordshyp in great quyetnesse and rest touchynge theyr ciuyle dyscorde.
                     About the .viii. yere of the reygne of this Kenulphus / Offa slewe a tyraunt named Beoruredus, yt before had slayne Ethelwald kyng of Mercia. After whose deth the sayde Offa as neuew to the sayd Ethelwald, reygned as kynge of that prouynce. Of this Offa is tolde many notable dedes, wherof somwhat I entende to shew. He hadde warre wyth the Northumbres, &amp; thē for a tyme subdued. He also had warre wyth Etheldrede kynge of eest anglys / and wyth Egbert otherwyse called Pren kynge of Kent. whome he toke prysoner, and led hym bounden wyth hym into Mercia.
                     Then after these vyctoryes, Offa buylded the chyrch of wychcom. In tyme of the whyche buyldynge, in presens of .xiii. byshoppes and many other great estatys / kynge Offa enlargyd the sayde Egbert of imprysonement. In token wherof the people beynge there present / made such an exclamacyon of ioye and gladnesse, that the chyrche therof range.
                     Thys kynge Offa hadde suche dyspleasure vnto the cytyzens of Caunterburye / that he remoued the archbyshoppes see by the agremente of the fyrste Adryane then pope, vnto Lychefelde. He also chased the Brytons or welshmē into walys / &amp; made

a famouse dyke betwene walys and the vtter bondys of Mercia or mydle Englande / the whyche to this day is named Offedyche. And after he buyldyd there a chyrch, whych longe tyme after was called Offekyrke. This Offa also by angelycall inspyracyon, translatyd the holy prothomartyr saynt Albone / and was fyrst founder of that famous monasterye ouer that holy bodye. The whyche syns the fyrste foundacyon hath by sondry tymes ben perished and hurt by Danys &amp; other / and newely syns that tyme reedyfyed. This holy Albon was martyred as before apperyth in the .lxvii. chapyter and storye of Cōstantius, about the yere of our lorde two hundred .lxxx. and .xvii. By whych reason he shuld lye or he were translatyd, ouer foure hundred and lx. yeres. This Offa also maried one of hys doughters to Bryghtricus y• was kynge of westsaxons. And for that in his tyme was varyaunce betwene hym and the Frēche men, that passage of marchauntes was forboden: therfore he sente that famouse doctour Anselmus vnto Charlis the great then kynge of Fraunce, to comon the meanes of a peace. whyche Charlis hadde after thys Anselmus in suche fauour / that he became hys discyple.
                     Then retourne we to Kenelphus / yt whyche before tyme had had often warre wyth Offa, and with hym many conflyctes, and lastely agreed. About the .xi. yere of thys Kenelphꝰ / Egbert kynge of Northumbres renouncyd his kyngly dignyte, and became a munke.
                     And lastely the sayde Offa, when he had reygned ouer Mercia .xxxix. yeres, as sayth Guydo / he lefte the kyngdome to hys sonne also named Kenelphus, and yode to Rome.
                     And this Kenulphꝰ kynge of westsaxon / kepte strongely hys lordshyp agayn ye power of all his enymyes, &amp; hadde his subiectes in due order of obedyence. Lastly Kenulph was supprysed wyth the loue of a womā that he kept at Merton / and hauntyd her more secretly then stode wyth his honour. wherof hauynge knowlege a kynnesman of Sygebert late kyng, entendynge to reuēge the deposynge of his kynnesmā / awayted the tyme, and beset the house where Kenulphe &amp; his paramour was smally accōpanyed. But so soone as Kenulph had espyed his enymyes / he serte vppon them, whych as sayth Policronicon were .lxxx. in nōber, and fought with them a longe whyle. But in the ende he was slayn of Clyto or Clyton his enymye.
                     It was not longe after or worde sprang of the kynges deth. wherfore Offricꝰ then beynge mayster of the kynges knyghtes / toke wyth hym a certayn of the sayde chyualry, &amp; pursued vpon the sayd murderers / &amp; lastly encountred wyth them, and slewe the sayde Clyto theyr captayne with the more parte of his companye. And that done he retourned to Merton / and there toke the corps of Kenulphe, and with great solemnyte cō
                        ueyed yt vnto wynchester / where yt was with all reuerēce enterryd / whē he hadde ruled the westsaxons (all be yt that of hym the englyshe cronycle maketh no mencyon) .xxxi. yeres.
                  
                  
                     Francia. THE .CLII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        PIpinus the secōd sonne of Charlis Martell, began his reygne ouer ye Frenchemen, in ye yere of grace .vii. hundred and .l / &amp;

the seconde yere of Kenulphus then kyng of westsaxons. This as before ye haue harde, was elected to that honoure, by assent of Pope zachary, &amp; the consent of the nobles of Fraūce / and after he was confermyd of the seconde Stephan, when he satte after as Pope.
                     The fyrste yere of his reygne / the Saxons otherwyse called Danys or Normannys, beganne to warre vppon hym. The whyche he encountred at the ryuer of Isayr / and them knyghtly ouercame, and chased and brought them fynally vnder his subieccyon. And in his returnynge into the countrey of Fraunce / word was brought to him of the deth of his brother Gryffon / the whych as before is sayde fledde vnto Gayferus duke of Guyan, and there helde hym to the ende for to haue caused the people of Guyan to haue rebellid, and to make warre agayne his brother Pepyn. wherof when some of them consyderyd the malycyous and vnstable condycyons of hym / in auoydyng more daunger, that to theyr countrey by his meanes myght ensue, they fell sodeynly vppon hym and slew hym.
                     when Pepyn was retourned into Fraunce / he by the aduyse of Remigius then byshoppe of Roan, amendyd the state of the chyrche / and causyd goddes seruyce to be songe, that before tyme hadde ben wyth lytle deuocyon and reuerence done and vtteryd. And other spyrytuall thynges that before were mysorderyd / he caused them to be sette in a better forme. And shortly after Stephā aboue named, confyrmed this Pepyn and his heyres for kynges of Fraunce / and of hym axyd ayde and assystence to wythstāde the power of Aystulphus then kyng of Longobardes / ye which then warryd vppon certayne landes belongyng vnto the chirch of Rome. The whyche kenge Pepyn to hym with good wyll graūtid / &amp; the begynnynge of the nexte yere folowynge, wyth a great hoste enteryd the boundes of Italy / and in the same made sharpe and cruell warre. In defence wherof the sayde Aystulphus made his beste prouysyon / and defendyd ye straytes and moūtaynes, by ye which the Frenche men shuld haue further entre into hys lande / and there gaue vnto his enymyes a stronge fyghte. All be yt he wyth his people was forcyd to gyue backe / &amp; for hys refuge toke ye citie of Papye. wherof Pepyn hauynge informacyon / beclyppyd ye sayd cytye wyth a strong syege. when Aystulphꝰ had a season defended hys cytye / &amp; saw by experiēce dayly his enimyes encreace, &amp; his power mynyshe and feble / in auoydynge of extreme daunger, he sought meanes of peace / and in suche wyse pursued the same, that he finally hadde peace to hym graunted / vppon condycyon that he by a daye lymytted, shuld restore to ye pope all ryght to his chirch belongynge, that he or any for hym helde or before tyme hadde wytholden / wyth other thynges concernynge the sayde peace. And for the perfourmaunce of the sayde condycyōs / he deliueryd immediatly good hostages and pledgys. After whyche peace thus substancially confermed / Pepyn wyth his hoste wyth great tryumphe retourned into Fraunce.
                     But not wythstandyng this assuryd peace, by the confyrmacyon of othe and other cyrcumstaunce before shewyd / the nexte yere folowynge he trustynge vppon better fortune of warre, denyed and reuokyd all his former grauntes / and refused to do as before he hadde fyrmyly promysed. For this vnstablenes and vntrouth to remedy / the pope of newe made requeste vnto Pepyn. The

which wythout longe taryeng resembled his knightes, &amp; made good sped towarde Italy / &amp; not wythout daū
                        ger passyd the mountaynes / and fynally besyeged Aystulphus wythin ye foresayd cytye of Papy. By meane wherof he lastly was constrayned to restore certayne cyties and other possessyons that before tyme he had taken from the pope.
                     After the whych agrement endyd and perfyted / wythin a shorte terme the sayde Aistulphus beynge in hys dysporte of huntynge, fell from hys horse or with his horse. By vyolence wherof he was so brosyd, that he dyed shortly after / whan he had ruled the Longobardes, Lumbardys, or Italyans .viii. yeres.
                     After this vyctory thus obteyned by Pepyn / the lordes and prynces that dwellyd aboute hym, feryd and drad hym, and sought to hym for allyaunce &amp; amyte. Amonge the whych Tassylon duke of Bayon before spoken of, that newly hadde conspyred agayn hym / yelded hym to the kyng, and became hys trewe lyege man / and swore to hym and to hys two sonnes feawte.
                     But the Saxons, whyche in the Frenche boke are named Soysons / coude neuer hold them cōtent without dystorbynge of the Frenchemen. wherfore kynge Pepyn assembled a greate hoste and made towarde thē, and had wyth them dyuerse conflyctes and batayles. So that at length they were dryuen to aske peace / vpō condicyō that yerely after they shuld yelde vnto the kynge of Fraunce iii. hundred good horses in waye of trybute.
                     And that done he retourned into Fraūce / and immedyatly after ordeyned by the aduyse of hys counceyle a courte or counceyle / ye whiche at this day is called ye parlyamēt of Fraūce, and is lyke vnto the courte of requestes now at this day holden in England. How be it yt of mych greater resort of people, and therwyth veray delayous / in so mych that as I haue herde credyble persons say / some one mater hath hanged there in dysputacyon ouer .xx. yeres. The whych parlyament at this daye is kepte at Parys, at Roan, and other two places of the lande. And for iudges of thys counceyll or parlyament, is deputyd of the kynges coste in euery place where it is kepte an hūdred persons, what of one and what of an other.
                     Than it foloweth, Gayfer duke of Guyan before mynded / of wyll more than of reason, set a trybute or imposycyon vppon the spyrytuall landes wythin hys lande wythout agrement of the clergy. wherfore the byshoppes for a redresse and remedy cōplayned them vnto kynge Pepyn. Then Pepyn sent vnto hym / monestynge hym in fayre and goodly maner, that he shuld exchew and forbere such doyng. And for the duke wolde not abstayne for the kynges cōmaū
                        dement / he in shorte whyle assembled hys army, and entred the territory of Guyan / in wastynge and spoylynge the countrey. And in so shorte whyle after put the duke in suche fere, that he was fayne to aplye hym to ye kynges mynde and pleasure / and bound hym to restore to the clergy all that he had before taken by extort power. But whan the sayde duke was assuryd of ye kinges retorne into Fraūce / he gathered a strength of knyghtes, and sent theym to the cytye of Chalours in Burgoyne / and dyd that he cowde or myghte to the domage of that towne and countrey. In whych season the kynge was at the towne or cytye called Dury / whyther and to the whyche towne tydynges were brought to hym of the vntrew dealynge

of thys foresayd duke. where wyth he beynge sore dyscontent / retournyd wyth his people into Guyā and therein bete downe many strong holdys &amp; castlellys / and toke or wōne at length burbon, Cancaruyle, and Cleremoūt / and from thens wasting the coūtrey wyth iron and fyre, yode tyll he came to Lymoges. And for ye wynter came on hande / the kyng for the ease and sauegard of his people, strengthyd these foresayde cytyes, townes, and holdes, that he before had wonne / and than yode to a place called Cause or Caus, &amp; there kepte hys crystmasse and ester. And whan the new season was come / not forgettynge hys former purpose, reentryd the foresayd duchy of Guyan, in wastynge the londe as he before hadde done / and after toke by strength the cytyes of Burgies and Towrs. In whyche season and tyme the duke wolde neuer apere in playne felde, but kepte hym in strong holdes / &amp; as one was wone, he fled into another.
                     Thys warre thus contynuynge / the countreye and people were sore empouerysshed. wherfore they lastly consyderynge the obstynacy of theyr duke / wyth also the greate daunger which they stode in: murderyd theyr sayde duke / and after yelded them &amp; the coūtrey to the kynges obeysaūce, wyth all suche treasure and iewelles as to the sayd duke belonged / where of Pepyn offerd a great parte of thē vnto saynte Denys.
                     Thys warre thus ended, wyth many other notable workes whereof the rehersall in order wolde aske a longe tracte of tyme: thys vyctoryous prynce Pepyn was vexed wyth greuous sykenesse. wherfore in all haste he sped hym vnto saynt Martynes, where he made certayne oblacyons and prayers / and thens hys sykenesse encreasyng, was conueyed vnto Parys / where he shortly after dyed, when he had reygned as kynge by the terme of .xviii. yeres / leuynge after him .ii. sonnes, that is for to say Charle mayne and Charlys.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLIIII. CHAPITER.
                     CArolomanus and Charlys sonnes of Pepyn / begā theyr reygne ioyntly ouer the Frenchmen, in the yere of our lorde .vii. hundred lxviii / and the .xx. yere of Kenulphe than kynge of westesaxons / so that Charlemayne had to his parte myddell Fraunce, and Charlys had Austracy wyth ye other deale of Fraūce.
                     Of ye elder brother Charlemayne lytell is lefte in memory / for he dyed whan he had reygned lytell ouer .ii. yeres. wherfore to Charlys fell the hole realme of Fraunce / the whyche of all the nobles was ioyously admytted.
                     It was not longe after / Hunyldys whom Pepyn by hys lyfe hadde ordeyned ruler of Guyan, rebellyd agayne the kynge, wherfore Charlys preparyd anone hys armye, and sped hym thyder / and in processe of tyme constrayned the sayd Hunyldꝰ to forsake the countrey, and for hys tuycyon to flee vnto Lupus than duke of Gascoyne, wherfore Charlys beynge aduertysed, sent hys message to the sayd Lupus / wyllynge &amp; commaundyng hym that he in spedy maner, shulde sende to hym hys rebell Hunyldus, or els he wolde with hys army inuade &amp; spoyle his people and coūtrey. Uppon resceyt of which message, Lupus by coūceyll condescendyd to the kynges pleasure / so yt he causyd Hunyldus to submyt hym vnto the kynges grace and mercy. wherewyth the kynge was so well contentyd, that vppon assuraunce taken of the sayd Hunyldus, yt there after he shulde be of good aberynge

toward the kyng / he clerely forgaue vnto hym all hys former offence. And after he had set that countrey in a rule and order / he retornyd into Fraunce. where to hym soone after came an embassade from the fyrste Adryan than pope / requyrynge hym of ayde agayne Desyderiꝰ thā kyng of Longobardys / the whyche than had taken from the chyrche of Rome many cytyes and other possessyons.
                     Than Charlys acceptyng the popes request / or he began any warre agayne the sayde Desyderius, sente vnto hym an embassade / wyllynge and requyrynge hym in all honorable wyse to restore vnto the chyrche of Rome, all suche possessyons as he from the same chyrche before tyme hadde taken and yet withhelde / and also to refrayne hym from all suche warre as he dayly made vppon the londys of the sayd chyrche. But for he sawe no frute ensue of ye message / he made prouysyon for all thyng nedefull to such a iourney. And shortly after passed the mountaynes, not all wythout batayle / and in processe cō
                        strayned Desyderiꝰ to take the cytye of Uercyle. where after he hadde refresshed hys Italyans / he gaue vnto the Frenchemen a sharpe and cruell batayle. But in the ende, Desyderius was compellyd to forsake the felde, and fled after to the forenamed cytye of Papy / where he kepte hym as after shall appere a longe whyle.
                     And for to shewe you somewhat of the foresayde batayle / ye shall vnderstande that for the greate occysyō of men yt there was slayne / the place was called longe after Mortaria, that is to meane in our vulgare or mother tonge the place of deth. In this fyghte were slayne amonge other two knyghtes greately famyd, Amys and Amylyon / of whom some fables are reportyd, bycause they were so lyke of semblaunt.
                     These two knyghtes as wytnessyth the Frenche story and also Antoninus / were brought vppe in the court of the foresayde Charles, and wyth hym well cherysshed / and fynally here slayne and buryed after some wryters in the two chappellys, whyche in the foresayde place were buylded to praye for the greate multytude of the soules of these knyghtes that there were slayne. But who that is desyrous to knowe the hole lyfe of those two foresayd knyghtes / let hym ouerse the thyrde chapyter of the .xiiii. tytle of Antoninus / and he shall there fynde a compendyous and goodly story / the whyche for length I ouerpasse and retorne my style agayne to Charlys. The which whan he was ware that Desyderius had taken thys cytye of Papy / and it greatly strengthyd both with men and vytell, in such wyse that he well vnderstode yt it myghte not be shortly wonne: he therfore layde about it a stronge syege wyth the ouersyght of sure and wyse capytayns / and after yode to Rome to vysyte the holy apostles Peter and Poule, and also to speke wyth the pope for dyuers maters. where he taryed a greate parte of the wynter folowynge, and after retorned vnto Papy / whych as yet was not delyueryd nor gyuē vp.
                     But it was not longe after his retorne that the cytye was wonne / wherein was takyn as prysoner the sayde Desyderius wyth hys wyfe and chyldren. The whyche to make shorte processe, he at length forcyd hym to restore vnto the pope all such possessyons as he before tyme hadde taken from hys chyrche / and addyd more there vnto, the two cytyes of Spoletys and Beneuent. And fynally depryued hym of all kyngely honoure, and ladde hym as prysoner

into Fraunce / and as a prysoner or exyle from hys naturall countreye kepte hym at the cytye of Lyons, as wytnessyth Cronica cronicarum, Iacobus Philippus, and other. And after by agremēt the pope gaue that kyngdome vnto Pypynus hys son / the whych cōtynued so in the French mens rule and possessyon, ouer the terme of two hundred yeres.
                     For thys vyctoryous dede thus obteyned by Charlis / the forenamed pope graūted vnto hym many great pryuyleges. Amonge the nomber whereof, one was that no pope durynge the lyfe of Charlys, shulde be in no wyse electid or chosyn tyll there came from hym a commaundement to go to that eleccyon. And also he graunted vnto hym inuestyture of benefyces spyrytuall. whyche grauntes and pryuyleges were confermed and authorysed in a Synode of an hundreth and .liii. bysshoppes, kepte in Fraunce by cōmaundement of the foresayd Adryan.
                     Of thys Charlys longe and tedyous it were to tell the hole of hys actes and dedes. wherfore I entende to towche but a parte of theym / and for the other deale I remitte to them yt haue further desyre of knowlege, vnto the bokes of Turpyn and Egyueaux chaplayne to the sayde Charlys / or ellys to the sayd bysshop Turpyn, whyche wrote a longe worke of hys vertuous dedes.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLV. CHAPITER.
                     
                        THis Charlys marcyall after his retorne into Fraūce / without there lōge taryeng sped hym agayne to the forenamed people called Soysons or Saxons, whyche newly rebellyd / and warryd sharpely vppon them, and fought wyth them sondry batayles. Amonge the whyche two ben specyally noted / whereof that one was foughten at a place called Onacre, and that other at the ryuer of Esam or Hesayre. By whyche two batayls the Saxons loste moch of theyr people, and were so sore feblysshed that they were fayne shortely after to put them in the mercy of Charlys. By reason wherof he bonde them vnto certayne lawes and ordynaunces / wherof specyally one as pryncypall of them, was that they frō that daye forth, shulde renounce and forsake theyr worshyppynge of idollys and fals goddes, and beleue in the fayth of Crystes chyrch, wyth many other. For the performynge of the whyche couenauntes / the kyng toke of them good pledgys &amp; hostages. And more ouer to the ende to mynysshe &amp; make lesse theyr strengthe / he chase out of them .x. thousande of the moste apte men for the warrys, and conueyed them wyth hym into Fraunce. And after he hadde clothed them with the mantell of baptyme / takynge of thē assuryd othe to be trewe to hym and to hys heyres: he after inhabyted them in dyuers places of his realme. Of the whyche people, as affermeth myne authoure, descendyd the Flemmynges and Brabāders. And thus endyd the warre of the Saxons or Soysons, that hadde contynued by the terme of many yeres passyd.
                     And forthwyth by assent and aduyse of hys counceyle / he preparyd all abilymentes and ordynaunce of warre, to go agayne ye Hunys yt then had wonne great groūd in Spayne. And for to bryng this war to ye more effectuall ende / he chase .xii. perys, which after some wryters are called dozeperys or kynges. Of the whiche

vi. were byshoppes &amp; .vi. temporall lordes. Of the whyche byshoppes thre were named dukes, whych were archbyshops / &amp; .iii. erlys, which were byshoppes. Of the temporall lordes thre were dukes and thre erlys / that is to saye the duke of Burgoyne, the duke of Neustria or Normandy, and the duke of Guyan / &amp; for .iii. erlys, the erle of Palantyne, ye erle of Tholons, and the erle of Champayn. Of yt whyche also some writers afferme, that ye famouse knyghtes Rowland and Olyuer were .ii / as Roulād erle of Palātyne. &amp; Olyuer erle of Tholous. when Charlis had prepared all thynges necessary to this gret iourney / he fyrste made his pylgrymage vnto saynte Denys, and there offerd ryche great gyftes, and after procedyd towarde his iourney / and fyrste besyegyd the citye called Pāpilona / the whych after .iii. monethes he subdued to his obeysaunce. This cytye stode in the entre of Spayne in the montaynes callyd montes Pyreni. After the obteynynge of whyche cytye, and by myracle of saynt Iamys as sayth Antoninus / Charlis commaūded all such as to Crystes fayth wolde be conuertyd, shuld be sauyd / &amp; the other to passe by sentence of the sworde. And after he hadde wonne ye fyrste cytye he wanne all the coūtrey adioynynge to the same / by reason wherof he caste great fere vnto the myscreantis / and wan by his strēgth and by appoyntemēt (so that they became his trybutaryes) these coūtres and prouynces hereafter ensuynge / that is to saye as wytnessyth Uyncēt historyall, Antoninus, and other ye land of Laudeluffe, the land of Pardis, the lande of Castyll, the lande of Maurys, the prouynce of Nauerne, the countrey of Portyngall, the lāde of Byscaye, &amp; the lande of Palarge / and destroyed in them all idollis and buyldyd in them chyrches and monasteryes / and brought the more partye of them to Crystes relygyon. And moste specyally the chyrche of saynt Iamys he buylded in Cōpostella wyth sumptuous coste / &amp; gaue there vnto great possessyons, to the maynteynyng of the diuyne seruyce of god and the mynysters of ye same. And ouer that with the treasour that he gate in these foresayd countreys / he buyldyd many dyuerse chyrches, as well in other places as there.
                     Longe yt were to tell all the cyrcū
                        staunce of this vyage and vyctoryes of the same. wherfore I passe ouer. And when Charlys hadde sped hys nedys / he had good wyll to retourne into Fraunce. In the whych retorne Carlis castynge no dought nor parell / by the treason of Gauelon a knyght or ruler of Gascoyn / ye which Gauelon hadde receyuyd of a Paynym kynge named Marsyll, great &amp; ryche gyftes for to betraye the hoste of Charlis, was dysceyuyd as after shewyth. Thys Gauelon the better to compasse and brynge to effecte his purpose / aduised Charlis wyth a certayne of his people to passe the porte of Cesayre, and to leue behynde hym in the rerewarde Rouland &amp; Olyuer wyth .xx. thousande of the resydue of his hoste. And when the kynge was passyd wyth his hoste / he gaue warnynge vnto the forenamed Marsyll and other, that they shulde close the sayde Rowlande in the place callyd Rounceuale. The whych accordyng to that false counsayll / with an hoste of .lx. thousande or mo, beclyppyd Rowlande and his people on euery syde, and there fell vppon the Crystē men and slew them wythoute mercy or pytye. In the whyche fyght, not wythstandynge the great slaughter that they made of the Sarasyns / fynally was there slayne the sayd Rowlande,

Olyuer, and many of the nobles of Fraunce. But this Gauelon scapyd not wythoute punyshement. For he was after taken / and wyth other to hym condescēdyng, were put to moste cruell deth at the cytye of Aquisgrany.
                     Of thys great vyctory of Charlis in subduynge of Spayn / are dyuers opynyons. For the Frenche cronycle and Antoninus agreen, that it shuld be after that Charlis was ennoynted emperour of Rome. But mayster Robert Gaywyn and other say, that yt was before he was emperour.
                     Thus this victoryous prynce retournynge into Fraunce, subdued thā after diuerse coūtreys, as Gallia Narbonensis, Campania or Champayn, and Beneuentana, and other / whych of one mynde hadde rebellyd agayne hym.
                     Aboute the .xxxi. yere of his reygne as moste wryters agre / certayne persons of Italy conspyred agayn Leo the .iii. then Pope of Rome, and hym vngoodly entreatyd. But he lastely escapyng theyr daunger / came vnto Charlis, and requyryd hym of hys cōfort and ayde / wherof he was not daungerous. But when he had well serchyd, and vnderstode that ye pope had susteyned wrong / he wyth all dylygence spedde hym thyther. And after he had subdued ye popes enimies / he restoryd the sayd pope to hys former dignyte. For the which dede and other that he had done for ye defence of the chyrch of Rome / he was by the sayd pope Leo or Leon sacryd or enoyntyd emperour of Rome.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLVI. CHAPITER.
                     CHarlis then thus sacryd as emperour, in the yere of oure lord .viii. hundred and one / when he hadde accomplyshed hys nedys for the weale of the chyrch and the pope, he then wyth great gyftes retourned into Fraunce.
                     In this tyme or soone after as witnessyth the Frenche cronycle, landed in Fraunce the famous clerkes Alcinnus or Albinus, Rabanus, &amp; Iohannes, and other of the discyples of Beda. The whych Charlis receyued wyth great honour / and by theyr coū
                        saylys instytuted and ordeyned fyrst the scole of Paris, and an other at Papia in Italy before minded. wherfore yt shulde seme that the sayde Alcinnus was not sent for any entreatyse of peace betwene the two realmes of Fraunce and great Britayn, as in the storye of Kenulphus before is shewyd.
                     After this tyme and season many great and noble dedis were done by this sayd Charlis, and by his sonnes and capytaynes vnder hym, and by his commaundement.
                     And for the personage of so noble a prynce shuld be had in mynde / therfore dyuerse authours testyfye yt he was fayre &amp; welfaryng of body, and sterne of loke &amp; of face. His body was viii. fote long / &amp; his armes &amp; legges well lengthed &amp; strengthed after the proporcyon of the body. His face of a spāne brede / &amp; his berde very long. Of hys strength wonders are tolde. He wold at one mele ete an hole hare or two hennes, or a hole gose, or lyke quātyte of other mete / &amp; drynke ther to a litle wyne mynglyd with water.
                     Amonge his other notable dedis, he made a brydge ouer the ryuer of Ryne of .v. hūdred pace longe, by the cytye of Magunce. And he buylded as wytnessyth Antoninꝰ and other / as many abbayes or monasteryes as there ben letters in the crosse row of the A.B.C.
                     And in the front of eyther of ye sayd abbayes, after the tyme of theyr foū
                        dacion

/ he pight or set a letter of gold of the value of an hundred pounde turnoys, whych is nere to the value of englysh money now curraunt .xx. mark. For a poūde turnoys is mych lyke .ii.s.viii.d. starlyng / and a poūd Parysyen is nere vppon .xl.d. starlyng. But it standyth at no certaynte, for hyghtynge &amp; lowynge of theyr coynes.
                     He also buylded or new reedyfyed the cytye of Aquisgrany / &amp; endowyd the chyrch of our lady there wyth many great gyftes and precyouse relyques, whyche yet remayne there to this daye / in whych cytye and nere aboute, he vsyd myche to abyde &amp; lye. And for his great dedes &amp; vyctoryes / he deserued to be named Charlis ye great. And for all his great myght and honour / yet yt not wythstādynge he was meke and lowly in herte, and mylde &amp; gracyous to the poore, and mercyfull to wretches &amp; nedy / &amp; sette his sonnes to lerne, as wel letters as marcyall &amp; knyghtly featys. And his doughter he set to spynnynge &amp; woll worke. And he was expert in all spechys / so that he neded none interpretours to explane or expresse to hym ye message of straunge ambassatours. And in the tyme of his dyner or meales / he vsyd to haue red before hym lessons and pystles / and specyally of the workes of saynte Austayne de Ciuitate dei. In hym was nothynge to be dyscommendyd / but that he helde his doughter so longe vnmaryed.
                     This noble man Charlis .iii. yeres before his deth / he hadde peace wyth all countreys, as well suche as were obeysaunt vnto ye empyre, as such as longed to his domynyon of Fraūce. In the tyme of reste amonge other goodly &amp; vertuous dedys, he made hys testamēt / &amp; dystrybuted his temporall mouable goodes in .iii. ꝑtes. wherof two part he gaue to ye maynteynynge of bishoppes and other mynysters of the chyrch, and for the reparacion of chyrches &amp; necessaries to the same, and to the maynteynynge of the dyuyne seruyce of god, with also ayde and fedynge of poore &amp; nedy people / and the thyrde parte to hys chyldren and other of his allye.
                     ye shall vnderstande, this Charlis had in his treasory specyally noted before hys other iewellys, iiii. tables or bordes / wherof thre were of syluer and the fourth of gold. In one was grauē the lykenes of the cytye of Cō
                        stantyne the noble, the whych he bequath to the chyrche of Romē. In an other was grauen or wrought the lykenysse of the cytye of Rome / &amp; that he gaue to the byshop of Reynes and to his chyrche. And the thyrd table of syluer, wherin was grauen the mappa mundi / and the fourth of gold he gaue to his sonnes.
                     Many thynges there were and causys of the exaltyng of ye fame of this prynce. But among other one is specyally remembryd of myn authoure Gagwyne / that the kynge of Percye then rulynge a great parte of ye Orient / sent vnto Charlis an ambassad honorable wyth many ryche presentis. Amonge the whyche was an horologe of a clocke of laten of a wonder artyfycyall makyng, that at euery oure of the daye and nyghte when the sayd clocke shuld stryke, images on horse backe apperyd out of sondry places, and after departid agayn by meane of certayne vyces.
                     He sente to hym also tentys of ryche sylke and balme naturall, with certayne Olyfauntys / requyrynge hym of amyty and frendshyppe. And in lyke wyse dyd the emperour of Cō
                        stantyne the noble / all be yt thathe in his mynde was not well contentyd, that the pope had in ye wyse dyuyded the empyre, and sette suche a man of

myghte in the rome therof.
                     Thys Charlis had dyuers wyues. But of the seconde named Eldegard he receyued .iii. sonnes / that is to say Lewys, Pepyn, &amp; Charlis / ye whyche Pepyn he made kynge of Longobardes or Italy, as before is shewyd.
                     Of thys great conqueroure what shulde I holde lenger processe? For lyke as I before shewyd / of his notable dedys myght I make a great volume, yf I shuld of them shew the clerenesse, and the circūstaunce of euery cōquest that he in his tyme acheuyd. But deth that is to all ꝑsones egall / lastly toke him in his dymme daūce, when he had ben kynge of Fraunce with his brother &amp; alone .xlvii. yeres. Of the whyche he ruled the empyre as before is shewyth .xiiii. yeres, in ye yere of his age as sayen the frenche cronycles .lxxii / and was buryed at Aquisgrany wyth great pompe, in ye yere of our lordes incarnacyon .viii. hundred and .xv. wyth this superscripcyon vppon his toumbe.

                     Of Rome, the bodye is hyd thys toumbe wythin.
                     Of the forenamed sonnes of Charlys suruyued ye eldest Lewys by name / and the other two Pepin &amp; Charlys dyed, before theyr father.
                  
                  
                     Anglia. THE .CLVII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        BRigthricus of the blood of Cerdicꝰ fyrst kyng of westsaxons descēdyd / beganne hys reygne ouer the sayd Saxons, in yere of oure lorde .vii. hundred and .lxxviii / and the .x. yere of Charlis the great then kynge of Fraunce.
                     This before tyme hadde maryed one of the doughters of Offa kynge of Mercia, as before is touchyd / by whose ayde and power he put out of hys rule Egbert the sonne of Alcumundus / the whyche Egbert at that daye was an vnder kynge or ruler in the lordshyppe of westsaxon, whyche Egbert was descendyd of ye blood of the holy Genulphus / of whome som parte of the storye ys declared in the .xxv. chapyter of the .v. boke of Policronica. And after he was thus of Brigthricus expulsyd / he saylyd into Fraunce, and there exercysyd hymselfe in featys of warre wyth the knyghtes of Charlys courte, durynge the lyfe of the sayde Brigthricus.
                     About the .ii. yere of thys Brigthricus, was sene in great Brytayne a wonder syghte. For sodeynly as men walked in ye strete / crossys lyke vnto blood fell vppon theyr clothes, and blood fell from heuen lyke droppes of rayne.
                     This after some exposytours / betokened the commynge of the Danes into this lande, the whyche entryd shortely after. For as wytnessyth Polycronica, aboute the .ix. yere of Brigthricus the Danys fyrste entryd this lande. In defence wherof / thys sayde kynge sent forth hys stewarde of housholde wyth a smalle company, whych shortly was slayn. But by the strength of Brygthricus and the other kynges of Saxons / they were cōpellyd to voyde the land for that tyme and season.
                     Brigthricus thus well &amp; knyghtly rulynge his land / his wyfe named Ethelburga not wyth hym cōtentyd as she oughte to be, soughte dyuerse wayes and meanes how she myghte brynge her lorde oute of lyfe / so that

fynally she poysoned hym wyth many other of hys housholde meyny. wherfore she ferynge punyshement, fledde into Fraunce / and by suche frēdshyppe as she there hadde, was well cheryshed in Charlis courte surnamed the great.
                     Of her yt is told, that whan he had hadde some informacyon of the vnstablenes of this womans condycyons / he at that season beynge a wydowar, vppon a season in passynge of the tyme wyth her / sayde, nowe I put to youre choyse whyther ye wyll haue me vnto your wedded lorde, or ellys my sonne stādyng here in your presence. And hym that you chose / hym shall you haue and enioye for your husbande. But she chase ye son and lefte the father. Then sayde the kynge / yf thou haddest chosen me, thou shuldest haue hadde my sonne. But for thou haste forsaken me thou shalt haue nother of vs. And after he closyd her in an abbey, where in processe a lewde man kept with her such company, that she was voydyd that place / and after demeaned her so vycyously, that in processe of tynie she fell in such pouerte, that she dyed in great penurye and myserye. For the whyche mysse demeanure of this woman, that she had innaturally slayne her lorde and husbande / the kyng of Anglis and specially of westsaxons, wolde not suffer the wyues to be callyd Sueuys / nor yet suffer them to sette by them in places of great honour or kyngely sete by a long tyme after. Thus as before is shewyd by the impoysonynge of his own wyfe, dyed ye kynge Brigthricus / when he had ruled ye westsaxōs after most concorde of writers by the terme of .xvii. yeres.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLVIII. CHAPITER.
                     EGbertus the sonne of Alcumū
                        dꝰ as before is shewyd / began hys reygne ouer the westsaxons in ye yere of grace .vii. hundred .lxxx. and xv / and ye .xxvii. yere of Charlis the great then kynge of Fraunce. Thys as before is sayde was dryuen oute of the lande of Britayne by ye strēgth of Brigthricus. But he hauynge knowlege of hys deth / spedde out of Fraunce, and in so knyghtely wyse hym demeaned, that he obteyned the regiment and gouernaunce of the aboue sayde kynge.
                     Bernulphus kynge of Mercia had this Egbert in derysyon / and made therof dyuerse scoffys &amp; iapynge rymes, yt which he susteyned for a time. But when he was somdeale stablysshed, and hadde prouyd the myndes and hartis of his subiectes / he lastly assembled his knyghtes, and gaue to hym a batayll in a place called Elyndome, in the prouynce of Hampton. And all be yt that in that fyght was great dyuersyte of nomber, as .vi. or viii. agayne one / yet Egbert had the victory. For his knyghtes were lene, megre, pale, and longe brethed, so that they myghte endure to fyghte. But Bernulphus knyghtes were fatte, corpulent, &amp; shorte brethed / so that they were soone ouercome with swet and shorte labour.
                     Here is to be noted, that after the deth of Offa kyng of Mercia or middell Englande (of whome somwhat is touched in the story of Kenulphꝰ) reygned his son Egfertꝰ / &amp; after Egfertꝰ reygned Kenulfus or Kēwolfus ye which Kenwolphus was father to ye holy martyr Kenelme, &amp; to .ii. fayre vyrgyns Ouindred and Burgenulda or Ermenilda. And after Kenwolfus succedyd the foresayd Kenelme / and after Kenelme reygned Colwolphus / and after hym succedyd Bernulphus before named.
                     Then to retourne agayne to Egbert / the whych when he had as before

is sayd ouercome Bernulphus, he seasyd that lordshyppe into hys hande. And that done, he made war vppon the Kentyshe Saxons / and at lēgth in lyke wyse of them obteyned vyctorye. And as wytnessyth Polycronica, he also subdued the Northumbrys / and caused the kynges of these thre kyngdomes to lyue vnder hym as trybutaryes or ioyned them to hys kyngedome as testyfyeth the authour of the Floure of hystories.
                     Thys Egbert also wanne from ye Brytons or walshemen the towne of Chester, that they hadde kepte possessyon of tyll that daye. For the whych vyctoryes thus by hym obteyned / he shortely after called a counsayll of his lordes at wynchester / and there by theyr aduysys crowned him kyng and chese lorde of this lande, that to fore thys daye is called Brytayne / and sente then oute into all costes of thys lande his commaundementes and commyssyons, chargyng straytly that from that day forthward, the Saxons shulde be called Anglys / &amp; the lande Anglia.
                     About the .xxiiii. yere of the reygne of Egbert, whyche shulde be the yere of our lord as meaneth Policronica viii. hundred and .xix. Kenelmus before mynded the son of Kenwolfus, was admytted for kynge of Mercia, beynge then a chyld of the age of .vii yeres. The whyche by treason of his syster Ouendreda was slayne in a thycke wood, by a tyraunt callid Hesbertus / and hys bodye after founde by a pyller of the sonne beame, or of lyght dyuyne that shone from his bodye towarde heuen. It ys also redde of hym, that a coluer bare a scrowle wryten in englyshe then vsed / and lette yt fall from hyr vppon the aulter of saynte Peter in Rome / wherof the wordes were these. At clense in Cowbacch, Kenelme Kenebern lyeth vnder Thorne hewyd beweuyd. whyche is to meane in englyshe now vsyd: at Clent in Cow vale vnder a thorne, lyeth Kenelmus hedlesse slayne by fraude.
                     when this holy body was founde, and was borne towarde the place of his sepulture / his forenamed syster entendynge some derysyon or other vylanye to be done to the corps, lenyd oute of a wyndowe where by the corps shulde passe. And to bryng her malycyouse purpose aboute, I note by what sorcery she ment / there she redde the psalme of the Sauter / begynnynge Deus laudem, bacward, But what so her entente was / she there incontynently fell blynde, and her eyen dystylled dropes of blood, that fell vppon the Sauter boke. The which in token of goddes wretche, in that boke remayne at thys daye to be sene. Of the holynes of thys martyr &amp; of his vertue, ye legēde of sayntes reportyth the surplusage.
                     In the .xxix. yere of the reygne of Egbert, or after the englyshe cronycle Edbryght / the Danys wyth a great hoste enteryd the seconde tyme thys londe, and spoyled the yle of Shepey in Kent or nere to kent. wherof herynge the kynge Egbert / assembled hys people, and met wyth theym at a place callyd Carrum. But he wanne of that fyghte lytell worshyppe / for the Danys compellyd him and his knyghtes to forsake the felde. And by presumpcyon of ye vyctorye they drewe westwarde / and made a confederey wyth weste Brytons that liued in seruage. By whose power they assayllyd Egbertus landes, and dyd myche harme in many placys of hys domynyon and ellys where / so that after thys daye they were contynuallye abydynge in one place of the realme of Englande or other, tyll ye tyme of harde

Kynytus laste kynge of the Danys blood / so that many of theym were maryed to Englishe women, and many that nowe ben or in tyme passed were called englyshe men, are dyscendyd of theym. And all be yt that they were many and sondry tymes dryuen out of that lande, and chasyd frō one countrey to a nother, as after ye shall here: yet that not wythstādyng they euer gaderyd newe strengthes and power / so that they abode styll wythin the lande.
                     Of the kynge of these Danys, and of what people they be dyscended, dyuerse opynyons of wryters there be / whych now I passe ouer, for so mych as I entende to shewe somewhat of theym in this worke folowynge.
                     Then it folowyth in the storye / the tyme contynuyng of the persecucion of these foresayd Paganys and Danes, Egbert or Edbryght dyed / whē he hadde well and nobly ruled the westsaxons and other the more parte of Englande, by the terme after most wryters of .xxxvii. yeres / and was buryed at wynchester as sayth Guydo, and lefte after hym a sonne named Athenulphus.

                        LOdouicus ye fyrst of that name, and sonne of Charlis the great / began hys reygne ouer ye realme of Fraū
                        ce, &amp; also his empyre ouer the Romaynes, in the yere of grace .viii. hū
                        dred and .xv / and the .xx. yere of Egbertus then kynge of westsaxons. Thys for his mekenesse was callyd Lewys the mylde or meke.
                     In tyme of hys fathers decease he was occupyed in Guyan / the whych he before tyme hadde the rule and domynyon of by commaundement of his father. But when he was aduertised of his faders deth, he anon sped hym toward Aquisgrani / so yt ye .xxx. day after hys departyng out of Guyan he came vnto the foresayde cytye, where he was mette wyth all the nobles and barons of Fraūce. And fyrst or he medled or toke vpon hym any cure or charge of hys owne besynes / he with most deuocyon causyd great obseruaunces and myche dyuyne seruyce to be done aboute the sepulture of his father, whyche obseruaunce &amp; prayers fynyshed and endyd / ye sayde Lewes commaundyd to come before hym dyuerse ambassadours, that frō dyuerse prynces were sent vnto hys father Charlis, and to theym gaue answers concernyng theyr legacyōs and messagis / and then proceded vnto the nedes of his realm for ye weale therof and of his people.
                     wherein he beynge besyed / worde was brought to hym of an ambassad royall, yt was comen from Michael the emperour of Constantyne the noble. Agayne the whyche he sent certayne of hys lordes to receyue them / and so wyth all honour to bryng thē vnto hys presence. Of whose commynge the entente was, to presente hym wyth certayne ryche gyftes, and to desyre hym of his amyte and frendshyppe.
                     Also soone after came vnto hym messengers from the Beneuētanys / offerynge vnto his magnyfycence obligacyons and bondes to be his true lyeges, and to paye to hym yerely in way of trybute .vi. thousande ducates of gold. A ducate is of sondry valuys / but the leste in value is .iii.s.iii.d. ob, and the beste .iiii.s.vii.d.
                     
                     Then the Soysons or Saxons that were so dyuerse of condycyon / 

beganne to murmoure and rebell agayne this Lowys. wherfore or he wolde assemble any people agayne theym / he sent thyder certayne persones to know ye cause of theyr rebellyon. And when he was enfourmed, that yt was for the takynge awaye from them of certayne lādes and possessyons by hys father / he then restored agayne the sayde landes / and so recouncylyd the countrey to his subieccyon. For this dede some of his lordes grudged / and sayde such myldenes was not to be vsyd to people of suche obstynacy and sternesse / but to haue forcyd them by dynte of sworde to haue lyued in due obedyence.
                     In thys passetyme dyed pope Stephan the fourth of that name / after whose deth was elected to that dygnyte the fyrste Pascall, wythout cō
                        sente or knowlege of this Lowys, &amp; somdeale to the dyscontentynge of his mynde &amp; pleasure. But in shorte tyme after he receyued such wordes and presentes from the sayde pope, that he was well satysfyed and pleasyd. And for at those days in Fraūce was vsyd of prestes and men of the chyrche precyouse and shewynge vesture, and golden and riche starynge gyrdelles, with rynges and other ornamentes of gold / the sayde Lowys purchasyd of the pope a correccyon for all suche as vsyd suche dysordynate apparell / and causyd theym to vse and were browne &amp; sad colours, accordynge to theyr honoures and sadnes.
                     This Lowys hadde thre sonnes, that is to saye Lothayre, whome he made felowe of the empyre / Pepyn the seconde, whome he made duke of Guyan / and Lowys the thyrde, to whom he betoke the rule of Bayton. To this yongeste sonne worde was broughte, that Bernarde a ruler in Italy had assembled a great power / &amp; wyth ye aydes of two other captaynes named Iylys and Reyner, the whyche Charlis the great by his lyfe greatly fauouryd / occupyed ye strēgthys of the mountaynes, and entendyd to kepe the countrey of Italye from the subieccyon of his father the emperoure. wherof he gyuynge his father knowlege / strong power was gaderyd, as well by the father as by Lothayre his sonne, and sped theym towarde the mountayns. But when the sayde Bernarde was ware of the emperours commyng wyth so great a strength / and consyderyd his lacke of power to mayntayn his purpose / wyth also the great mercy and pytye that he knew to be in the emperour: he submytted hym holy to hys grace and mercy, and dyscoueryd to hym the authours of that rebellyon / the whyche thys Lowys causyd vnder safe kepynge to be hadde vnto the cytye of Aquisgrany. The whyche rebellys were the byshop of Mylayne, the byshop of Cremoun, and the bysshoppe of Orleaunce.
                     The kynge passed all the wynter folowyng at the foresayde cytye / and lastely caused to be broughte before hym the foresayde transgressours, &amp; examyned the cyrcumstaunce of the foresayd treason, and after remytted them to the rygour of Lowes / where by processe they were condemnyd to deth as many of them as were temporall men.
                     Then the emperour hauynge compassion of the forenamed Bernarde, for so myche as he was the sonne of Pepyn laste kynge of Italy, and his nere kynnesman / transmutyd the sentence of deth vnto perpetuyte of pryson and losynge of hys syghte. But for the sayde Bernarde, Reyner, and other, chase rather to dye thē to lyue in pryson wyth that deformyte / they passyd by dinte of the sworde, &amp; were

beheddyd within or nere to the sayd cytye of Aquisgrani. And the sayde bysshoppes were depryued of theyr dygnyteys &amp; put into pryuate houses of relygyon.
                     And whyle thys Lewys was occupyed in lytell Brytayne, in subduynge of that countrey / Lothayre the eldest sonne of thys Lewys was sent to rule the lōdes of ye empyre. where he bare hym ryght nobly, and executed dyuers actes for the weale of the empyre. But in thys season .ii. frendes of hys father and hys / were for certeyne crymes to them put, moste cruelly condēpned to vyle deth with in the cytye of Rome. wherof heryng Lothayre than beyng at the cytye of Papy, sent worde therof to hys father in all hasty wyse / the which was lyke to haue turnyd ye pope to greate trowble, yf he by polytyke and wyse meanes had not shortly pacifyed the mater. That one of the foresayd two persones so condempned was scrybe to the pope, and that other was Donar.
                     ye shall vnderstande that thys Lewys hadde two wyues / by the fyrste he had the forenamed thre sonnes, and of the seconde he receyued a son and named hym Charlys / the which whan he came to mannes stature, was surnamed Charlys ye bolde. He loued entyerly thys Charlys, &amp; wold often kysse hym in the presence of his brethern. For the whych they enuyed theyr sayd brother / and also dysdayned theyr father as here after shall appere.
                     Thus in processe of tyme Lewys gaue vnto thys Charlys the coūtrey of Neustria or Normādy / the which causyd greate dyscencyon amonge the bretherne / and also for thys and other causes, Lotharius toke partye agayne hys father.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLX. CHAPITER.
                     THys seconde wyfe of Lewys was named Indith / ye which was accusyd to the pope to be within suche degre of allyaunce to hyr husbonde, that she myghte not lawfully contynewe hys wyfe. wherfore contrary to the wyll of Leuys, by the laboure of some bysshoppes &amp; other lordes of Fraūce, she was deuorcyd from hym / and put into a house of nonnys, and there straytly kepte.
                     But Lewys for a tyme susteyned thys iniuryes, to ye ende yt he myght know whyther his sonnes fauoured the cause or not. But in processe of tyme whan he hadde experyence of hys frendes / and of hys sonnes / he thā assembled to hym a strong hoste, and recoueryd hys wyfe malgre to all hys enmyes. For the whych dede Lothayre, wyth dyuers of the Barons of Fraunce, assemblyd theyr people / and entendyd to depryue Lewys from all imperyall and kyngly dygnyte. wherfore Lewys ferynge hys sonne and hys assystens / &amp; also for the entent that he myghte assemble the strength of ye empyre: he yode vnto Magunce. And after he hadde purueyed and garnysshed hys retynewe / he retornyd toward Fraunce, and met wyth some of hys enemyes and them subdued / and so kepte on hys iourney tyll he came to Aquysgrany, where he restyd hym and hys people.
                     Thus contynuynge thys dyssencyon / the sonnes sent wrytyng to the pope than beynge named Gregory ye fourth, requyrynge hym of ayde and counceyle to deuyse a concorde and peace bytwene theyr fader and them.
                     At whose request / and for to cause a naturall charyte to be quyckenyd bytwene the father &amp; hys .iii. sonnes / he came in hys proper persone into

Fraunce, and endeuoryd hym to the vttermoste of hys wyttes to agree to the sayd parties. In the tyme of this entreaty made by the pope / I can not saye for what cause, many of the lordes / on the partye of Lowys forsooke hym, and fled to the sōnys partye / so that the emperoure was in great feere of hym selfe, &amp; of hys parson. whan Lewys had seen his frendes thus in tyme of hys nede refuse &amp; flee frome hym, and lefte hym in great feere and daūger of straūgers he than thoughte better for hym to put hym selfe vnder the Rule and tuycion of hys owne chyldren, than to abyde the doute of the sayde straū
                        gers. wherfore he sent vnto his sayd sonnes / requyrynge theym to prouyde for his safegarde and assurynge of his person, and that he were not there oppressyd or murdryd. And within shorte space after this message sent to theym withoute answere of them agayne receyuyd, he rode towarde theym smally accompanyed. where of than Lothayre and hys brother hauynge warnynge in all homble wyse encountred hym, and receyued hym vppon theyr knees / and so cōueyed hym wyth all reuerēce vnto theyr pauylyon or tent. And after for a begynnyng of a peace to be stablysshed bytwene hym and them / he to satysfye theyr myndes, refused the forenamed Indith, and closyd her in a place of relygyon called Torton, as testyfyeth myne authour mayster Robert Gagwyne. But the Frenche boke sayth that thys dede was done by Frederyke bysshoppe or Utryke / where fore he was after pyteously slayne by such as fauoured ye quene / and not all wythout her concent, as wytnessyth the sayd cronycle.
                     And whan Lewys had in thys &amp; other thynges agreed vnto hys sonnes / and thought hym self to be in surete of theyr amyte and fauours: sodeynly he was cōueyed vnto the monastery of saynt Medrid / or as sayth the Frenche boke he was conueyed to a towne called in Frenche Melanguy, wyth hys yonge sonne Charlys. And that done / the sayd thre sonnes deuyded theyr fathers possessyons amonge theym thre. That is to saye Lothayre the eldeste, had to his porcyon the londes of the empyre / Pepyn, the countrey of Guyan / and to Lewys the yongest, fell the countrey of Bayon.
                     whyche mysery of the emperour whan the pope had beholden &amp; seen / he wyth greate mornynge retorned into Iuly &amp; so vnto Rome. In which tyme of prysonemēt of the emperour the sayd Lewys made dyteys &amp; pystelles of greate sorowe and lamentacyon, to the ensample of all erthlye prynces / and to the entent that hys sonnes shulde of hym haue the more compassyon and pytye. The whyche I ouer passe for length of tyme / and the rather, for in tyme of prysonemēt of Edwarde the seconde callyd Carnaruan was by hym made a lyke cō
                        playnt / where of when tyme &amp; place comyth, I entende to expresse some parte therof.
                     whan Lewys had thus a season remayned in pryson / for so myche as the comons shulde not thynke that thys shuld be done by the authoryte of ye thre sonnes onely: therfore they causyd a coūsayle to be callyd at the cytye of Compeyne / &amp; there by theyr meanes and labours causyd theyr father by authoryte of spyrytuall &amp; temporall lordys, to be discharged of all rule and domynyon, as well of the empyre as of the realme of Fraū
                        ce, by authoryte of the sayd coūsayle or parliament / and after caused hym to renoūce all hys temporall habyte, and to become a munke in the monastery

of saynt Matke / where he was lefte of his sonne Lothayre, not with out sure watche and kepynge.
                     But full often it is seen, that whā the erthlye power of man faylyth or wekyth / god of hys greate mercy the repentaunt synner to grace callyth, &amp; hym by hys dyuyne power aydeth and strengtheth / and so he dyd thys Lewys. For after thys mysery and trybulacyon thus to hym fallen / the peple in dyuerse placys of this londe murmured and grudgyd very sore, agayne the innaturall dealynge of the sonnes agayne theyr father.
                     In these dayes was a greate ruler in Fraunce named Guyllyam, &amp; stuarde or constable of that lande / ye which wyth one Egebard or Edgare a man of greate byrth and alyaunce, coūsayled togyder for the enlargyng of ye emperour. And lastly wyth ayde of theyr frendes assembled a greate peple. And than drewe vnto them .ii. noble men of Burgoyne called Barnarde and Gueryn, the whyche sometyme had ben well cherysshed wyth the emperoure Lewys.
                     All thys season Lothayre had restyd hym for ye more partye at Aquysgrany. But whan he harde of the assemblynge of these foresayd lordes, he sped hym towarde Parys. And whan he was thyther comen / the foresayd lordes sent vnto hym two noble men Rowlande and Gantelyne / the whych made request vnto Lothayre in the name of the other lordes, that it wolde lyke hym to restore hys father vnto hys former dygnyte / wyth other thynges concernynge theyr legacyon. To the whyche two lordes Lothayre gaue answere, that of hys fathers restorynge to hys fyrste or former dygnyte, no man lyuynge wolde be therof more fayne than he wolde. But ye deposyng of hym was done by the hole authoryte of ye land. wherfore yf he shulde be agayne restoryd / it must be by the same authoryte, and not by hym onely. All be yt that they myghte knowe of hys benyuolēce and fauour that he bare towarde hys father / he wylled them to stonde a parte, whyle he had some cō
                        munycacyon of his lordes for ye same mater. By reason wherof were it for fere or for fauour / the emperour was shortly after put at hys lybertye, and restoryd to all hys fyrst honoure and dygnyte / &amp; than with great honoure conueyed to a cytye or towne called Ciriciake, where met wyth hym hys other two sōnes Pepyn and Lewys / and there restyd hym certayne dayes in makyng all feest and ioye / and after rode vnto Aquysgrany, and there restyd an other season.
                     In whych tyme of hys there beyng / was brought vnto hym from ye place where she had ben prisoner, his wyfe Indyth. But whan Lothariꝰ knewe that hys father had hyr agayne receyued contrary to hys mynde and pleasure / he in wrath &amp; dyspleasure entryd the countrey of Burgoyne / &amp; made in it sharpe and cruell warre, &amp; executed therin many spoylynges and other inordynate dedys. The whyche cruelty to wythstande &amp; let / hys father wyth hys sonne Pepyn wyth a greate hoste sped hym thyder warde. But anone as he had knowlege therof / mystrustyng his strēgth, he yelded hym vnto his faders grace and mercy / whom the meke fader receyued and forgaue to hym hys trespasse.
                     And after that of hym and dyuerse of hys lordes he had taken assuryd othes and other suretyes / he thā sent the sayd Lothayre into Italy with a certayne nomber of knyghtes, to defende the countrey from daunger of enemyes, and strengthynge of the straytes and mountaynes.
                     
                        And that wyth other thynges orderyd and done for the weale of hys realme / Lewys than toke vpon hym to ryde about hys lande, to thentent that he myghte be somwhat enformed of the rule of hys offycers / and how the countreys were ruled by the rulers of them. And where he found any mysgouernaunce / he punysshed the executers therof, as well ye bysshoppes as other, as farre as his authoryte in that behalfe stretchyd.
                     Than Indith consyderynge the emperoure fell into greate age / and hyr sonne and his Charlis by name, had as yet no suffycyent landes nor possessyons to maynteyne any estate wyth: she compassed many wayes in hyr mynde, how she myghte acheue hyr entent, and to brynge it to good purpose. where fynally by counceyll of hyr frendes, to ye ende to purchase the loue and fauour of Lothayre / she axed of hyr lorde and husbonde, that the sayd Lothayre myghte be tutour and gyder of hys yonge sonne Charles. Of this request ye emperour was very glad, and graunted hyr, hyr peticion. And so it fell soone after, certayne messengers came to the emperoure from Lothayre hys sonne. To the whych whan Lewys had gyuen answere to such maters as they were sent fore, and gyuē vnto them other instruccyons / he sent them forthe agayne, and with them certeyne other to wylle his sayd sonne to come vnto hym in as goodly wyse as he myght. But at that season he excusyd hym by sykenesse / and whan he was recouered he fayned an other excuse.
                     In thys meane tyme worde was brougth to the emperoure, that hys sonne Lothayre had greued ye chyrch of Rome / and takyn from it certeyne possessyons. wherewyth Lewys beynge before amoued, sent vnto hys sonne / cōmaundynge hym in sharpe wordes, yt he shulde haue in mynde the othe before by hym made / &amp; that he shulde in exchewynge his dyspleasure, make restytucyō of all thynges that he before hadde taken from the chyrch / the whyche cōmaundement Lothayre promysed to obey in all wyse. And where Lewys was determyned to haue gone vnto Rome, to haue sene ye sayd promesse fulfylled / &amp; also to haue spoken wyth the pope for dyuers maters nedefull for the chyrche: he was lette by occasyon of Danes or Normannes, yt than had newly inuaded the lōdes of Fraūce / the whyche he shortly after expellyd and droue out of hys londys.
                     And that done, the emperour yode vnto Aquysgrany / where by the frendes of Indith &amp; other of the nobles of Fraunce, the emperour gaue vnto hys yongest sonne Charlis a porcyō of ye empyre, whyche after shall more clerely appere. And soone after at a counsayle holdyn at Cirycyake, before namyd in the presence of his son Lewys / he gaue to hym the order of knyghthode, &amp; adournyd hym wyth kynges clothynge.
                     And ouer all thys in the presence of many lordes of Fraunce / he gaue to the sayde Charlys the hole countrey of Neustria that now is named Normandye. Of whyche honoure and gyftes though hys moder were ioyous and gladde / yet hys brother Lewys was therewyth nothynge contentyd, whyche of Indith and of hyr frendes was well apperceyuyd and knowen. wherefore as she before tyme had done / than of newe she made request vnto hyr lorde and husband, that he wolde of hys moste especyall grace graunte vnto hyr, that Lothayre myghte haue the gouernaunce of hyr sonne Charlys / the whych of hym was the seconde tyme graunted. Uppon whyche graunte

thus to her made / the emperour sent vnto hys son Lothayre pleasaūt letters, wyllyng hym in all goodly hast to resorte vnto hys court. The which obeyenge hys fathers commaundement / retourned into Fraunce shortly after the receyte of the said letters, and came vnto his father to the citye of Uernayse, of whome he was ioyously receyued. And after he hadde a season dwellyd with the emperour, he gaue vnto hym the coūtrey of Austracy / the whyche countrey as shall after be shewyd in thys Lotharius story, was after his name named Lorayne. But a parte of the sayde prouynce or countrey that stretchyd towarde Hungrye / the sayde Lowys gaue vnto his yongest son Charlys. And immedyatly after thys gyftes before many lordes confermyd / the emperoure in presence of the sayd lordes, toke Charlys by the hande, and delyueryd hym vnto his brother Lothayre / wyllynge and straytly chargynge hym that he shulde take hym vnto his cure, and be to hym as curyouse as he wolde be vnto hys own chyld, and to guyde hym and his possessyons, as the father shulde guyde the chylde. And to Charlys he commaunded that he shulde take &amp; obey hym as his father, and loue and worshyppe hym as his brother / ye whych vppon eyther partye was promysyd to be obseruyd. And shortly after the sayd Lothayr with his brother Charlys, toke congy of father and mother, and returned agayn into Italy.
                     About this tyme dyed Pepyn the seconde sonne of Lewys, and duke of Guyan / the whych yf all shuld be expressyd, putte his father to great trouble and vexacyon / wherfore for hym was made the lesse mournynge. This left after hym a son named Pepyn, of whome somwhat the storye spekyth after. But now I wyll retourne to Lewys the thyrde sonne of the emperoure.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXI. CHAPITER.
                     TRouth yt is that whē the yonger brother Lewys sawe the bountye of his father so largely extende towarde his two brethern, and to hym nothynge / he was therwyth in his mynde greatly dyscontent, all be yt that for the tyme he kepte yt secrete to hym selfe. But when he was departyd from hys father, and returnyd to his owne lordshyppe / he gaderyd a myghty power, and began to make warre vpon the dwellers nere about the Ryne. wherfore the emperour wyth a conuenyent power approchyd vnto the citye of Dodayng / and sent from thens vnto hys sayde sonne wordes of reconcylyacyon / by meane wherof the sayde Lowes put hym holy in the grace of hys father, and was to hym reconcyled without shedynge of mannys blood.
                     But whyle the emperour was besyde at the citye of Cleremoūt in the countye of Auerne, to set a dyreccion amonge the Gascoynes, for opynyons that were reryd amonge theym for the sonne of Pepyn there lately kynge or duke dyscessyd, whyche son as aboue is sayde was also named Pepyn / and there about had taken great payne and labour: thyther to hym tydynges were newly brought, that hys sayde sonne Lewys hadde wyth ye Saxons or Soysons, &amp; with the Thorynges made alliaunce / and was entryd into Germany, and therin made warre in moste cruell wyse. wyth whyche tydynges Lowis was so greuously passyoned / that to hys great age was by meane of thys vnkynde anger, fyxyd a sykenes that lefte hym not whyle he lyued.
                     After yet thys not wythstandyng / 

he lyke a strong hartyd knyght shewyd forth a good and comfortable coū
                        tenaunce. And after he hadde in knyghtly wyse preparyd all thynge necessarye to the warre / he spedde hym towarde Almayne, and contynued hys iourney tyll he came vnto Thorynge / where a season he restyd hym and his people tyll he myght be better assuryd where his sonne Lewys restyd hym. But the sonne hauynge knowlege of the great power of hys father / and also beynge in despayre of purchasynge of mercy, consyderyng his many offences: fled by the coūtrey of Sclauony, and so by that costes retourned into Bayon or Bauery / and so escapyd the daunger of hys father.
                     Then the emperoure beyng surely enformyd of the scape of hys sonne / helde on his iourney tyll he came to Magoūce. And after came vnto the cytye of Uermayse / where he called a counsayle of his lordes spyrytuall and temporall, and ordeyned there dyuerse thynges for the state of the empyre. And more entendyd to haue done / but sykenesse increasyd so sore in hym, that by the space of .xl. days he toke no temporall sustenaunce. But in that tyme he vsyd often to take the blessed sacrament / the which as he often sayde, strengthyd bothe the soule and the bodye.
                     Then he sent for Lothayre to come vnto hym / the whyche wythoute taryenge obeyed his commaundemēt, and abode styll wyth hym.
                     Of this Lewys Policronicon maketh a shorte rehersall / and sayth y• by his fyrste wyfe named Hermyngarde, he had .iii. sonnes / Lothayre, Pepyn and Lewys. The fyrst beyng felowe with his father of the empyre, was crowned of pope Pascall vpon an Ester daye / and he was also kyng of Italy. And Pepyn he made duke of Gascoyne and Guyan. And Lewys was made ruler of Bauary.
                     And by his second wife named Indyth and doughter of ye duke of Bayon, he hadde Charlis the Ballyd / to whome he gaue the countrey of Burgoyn as the sayd Policronica sayth. And for this Lewys was mylde / he was often troubled of hys own men and of other, tyll he delte wyth them more sharpely and wysely, and ruled the people more straytly.
                     It is there also shewyd, that when this Lewys had promotyd a yonge man named Frederyke to the see of Utryke / and to hym hadde gyuen sadde and good exhortacyon, that he shuld folowe the stablenes of hys antecessours, and that he shulde purpose the sothe and trouth wythoute excepcyon of persones / and punyshe mysdoers, as well the ryche as the poore: the sayde byshoppe shulde answere to hym and saye, I beseche thy magestye syr emperour to take in pacyence, that I maye dysclose to the that thynge that hath long walowed &amp; turned in my mynde. Say thy plesure sayd the emperour. I praye thy syr emperour shewe me thy mynde / whyther is more accordynge, to attame thys fyshe here presente fyrste at the hedde or at the tayle. The emperour answered shortely and sayd, at the hedde the fyshe shall be fyrste attamyd. So yt is lorde emperoure sayd the byshoppe, that crysten fayth maye cause the to cease of thyne erroure, that thy subiectes be not boldyd to folowe thy mysdoynge. wherfore fyrste forsake thou thy vnlawefull wedloke, that thou haste made wyth Indyth thy nere kynnes woman.
                     By meane of those wordes the kyng was reconcylyd, and lefte the company of his wyfe, tyll he hadde purchasyd a lycence of the pope. And the

emperour forgaue the sayde byshop all trespassys / but the woman hyred two knyghtes that slewe hym in his vestymentes, when he hadde ended hys masse.
                     After thys the empresse was falsely accused of wronge cryme, and made a menchon. But the same yere the emperoure delyueryd her from that habyte, when he hadde suffycyently prouyd the sayde cryme to be false.
                     Then to retorne where I lefte / whā this Lewys had longe lyen in thys agonyous sykenes, and knewe well that he amendyd nothynge / but feblyd more and more / he commaundyd his iewellys to be broughte before hym. wherof by hys owne hand he haue a parte vnto the chyrche of Rome / and to Lotharius his sonne there presente he gaue his crowne &amp; his sworde / commaundynge hym straytly vppon his blessynge that he shuld haue in honour hys moder Indith, &amp; that to Charlis his brother he shulde owe true loue &amp; amyte, &amp; that he shuld hym &amp; his lādes deffende to the vttermoste of his power.
                     Then the lordes spirituall and temporall, and specyally the archebysshoppe of Meaws / made a lamentable requeste to the emperoure for his sonne Lewys, that he wolde accepte hym to his grace and mercye, and to forgyue hym hys insolente and wanton wylde dedys. wherof when the emperour harde / he fell in suche wepynge, that he myghte not speke of a good whyle after.
                     And when he hadde refrayned hym therof / he remembryd to ye lordes the many and great benefytes yt he had done to hym, and the innaturall vnkyndnes that the sayd Lewys had agayn shewyd vnto hym / &amp; how often tymes he had perdoned his vnkynd sonnes trespasse. And finally all this not wythstandyng / he was at ye oure in perfyte charite wyth hym, and forgaue hym as he trusted to be forgyuen / prayenge the lordes there present, and specyally chargynge ye sayd byshop, that he wold shew vnto hys sayd son that great daunger that he was in agaynst god for the dyspleasures done to him / and specially that he was a cause of the abrygement or shortynge of hys dayes.
                     Then to brynge this story to effect, wherof yf I shuld declare the special tyes therof, wolde aske a longe tyme (for ye shall vnderstand that these .ii. storyes of the great Charlis and of this Lewys, occupye in Frenche of leuys of great scantelyn ouer .lxiiii) wherfore I conclude yt he dyed lyke a good crysten prynce, when he had ben emperour of Rome and kynge of Fraunce by the terme of .xxvi. yeres / and was buryed wyth great solemnyte at Meaws or at Mettis by hys mother Hyldegarde as sayth mayster Robert Gaguyne, in the yere of hys age .lxiiii / leuynge after hym the foresayde thre sonnes Lothayre, Lewys and Charlys the Ballyd.
                  
                  
                     Anglia. THE .CLXII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        ADeulpus or Ethelwolphus the son of Egbertus / beganne hys reygne ouer the westesaxons or Anglys, in the yere of oure lordes incarnacyon .viii. hundred and .xxxii / and the xvii. yere of Lewys the mylde then kynge of Fraunce.
                     Thys in his youth was wyllynge

to be a preste, and was enteryd the order of subdeacon.
                     But there after by dyspensacyon of Pascall the fyrst of that name pope / he was maryed to Osburga a woman of lowe byrthe. By whome he hadde foure sonnes / that is to meane Ethelwalde, Ethelbert, Etheldrede, and Alurede / the whyche after theyr father reygned as kynges of Englād that one after that other, as after shall appere.
                     This Adeulphus after he hadde a certayne tyme ben kyng / he went to Rome, and toke wyth hym his yongest sonne Alurede or Alphrede / and taryed there by the space of a yere. In the whyche season he repayred the Saxon scole / the whyche before tyme was there founden by Offa kynge of Mercia, as Guydo sayeth and other / but more veryly of Iue kynge of westsaxons, as sayth the authoure of the Floure of historyes. And for that he graunted of euery house of his kyngdome a peny, as in his storye is before shewyd.
                     But thys scole was sore decayed, and the house therof lately brent / the whyche thys Adeulphus newely repayred, and sette yt in better order then yt before was vsyd.
                     Thys kynge also to refourme the greuouse correccyons that he sawe there executyd to Englyshe men for spyrytuall offensys, as in werynge of irons and guyues: he graunted of euery fyre house of hys lande .i. d, as Iue foresayde hadde done.
                     By the whyche sayenge yt shulde seme / that by these two kynges shuld be grauntyd vnto Rome .ii. d. of euery fyre house thorough theyr lande.
                     But that maye not be so vnderstande / for thys Rome scot ys gaderyd of euery house a peny wythout more.
                     wherfore yt muste folowe, that yt is mysse taken of wryters, that allege this dede to that one kynge for that other. How be yt, yt maye stande by reason, that Iue made the fyrste graunte, and this kynge after confermyd the same. But the authoure of Cronica cronycarum sayth, that thys Adeulphus graunted to saynte Peter these sayde Peter pens / and spekyth no word of Iue nor of none other.
                     It is also shewyd of this kynge by Policronica / that he shulde for the acquytynge of the chyrches of Englād of all maner of kynges trybute, payed yerely to Rome thre hundred markes. That ys to meane to saynte Peters chyrche a hundred markes / to the lyghte of saynt Paule a hundred marke / and to the popys treasorye a hundred marke. And ouer all thys of hys pure deuocyon, he offred to god &amp; to saynte Peter the .x. parte of hys moueable goodes.
                     And also one cronycler sayth, that thys kynge founded fyrste the vnyuersytye of Oxynforde / whyche was lykely to be done by Offa kynge of Mercia, for so myche as in his days flowred that famouse clerke Alcumus or Albinus / the whych as sayth the frenche cronycle, was fyrste foū
                        der of the scole of Parys and of Papya, as is before shewyd in ye story of Charlys the great, in the thyrd chapyter of the sayde storye.
                     when Adeulphus hadde thus sped hys besynes and pylgrymage at Rome, he retournyd by Fraunce / where at that tyme was kyng of that lande Charlys the Ballyd, of whom he was ioyouslye receyued. And after he hadde dysportyd hym there a season / he spousyd the doughter of the sayde Charlys, in the .xx. yere of the reygne of the sayde Adeulphus, as testyfyeth Policronica in the .xxx. chapiter of his .v. boke / whych shuld

be the yere of the reygne of the sayde Charlis the .xi. But of this mariage is nothynge touchyd in the frenche cronycle.
                     Then Adeulphus takynge leue of the kynge / toke shyppynge and landed in Englande wyth his wyfe Indyth by name. And for that he contrary the law made in ye tyme of Brigthricus, sette his wyfe in the kynges trowne, and magnyfyed her lyke a quene / the lordes of his lande arose agayne hym, and pullyd from hym a great parte of his domynyon, and made his eldeste sonne ruler therof. whyche all was done in reproche of Ethelburga, whyche slew her lorde Brigthricus as before is shewyd. Lastly the mater was appeasyd, and he to his kyngly honour restoryd.
                     About this tyme Bertulphꝰ kyng of Mercia, slewe wyckydly in the holy tyme of Penthecoste saynte wyl stone / whose holy bodye was buryed at Repyngedō. And in ye place where thys holy wylstone was slayne stode a pyller of lyghte .xxx. dayes after.
                     And in the yere folowynge dyed the sayde Bertulphus. After whose deth, Burdredus was made kynge of Mercia or myddell Englande / the whyche before tyme hadde spousyd the doughter of kynge Adeulphus.
                     In the later dayes of thys Adeulphus, the Danys dyd myche harme in Lyndesey, and also in kent / and frome thens came to London, and robbed and spoyled the cytye. wherfore Adeulphus gaderyd his people, and lastely mette wyth them in Southerey vppon a downe called Oclea / and there dyscomfyted theym, not wythoute shedynge of great plente of the Anglis blood, and forsyd them to take the see / so that after they landed in eest Anglia as after shall appere. Then lastely dyed thys good kynge Adeulphus or Ethelwolphꝰ / when he hadde ruled hys subictes nobly by accorde of moste wrytes fully .xxii. yere / and was buryed at wynchester, leuynge after hym four sonnys aforesayde.
                  
                  
                     Francia. THE .CLXIII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        CHarlys ye yongeste son of Lewys the mylde / began hys reygne ouer the chefe part of Fraū
                        ce, in ye yere of our lorde .ix. hundred &amp; .xli / and the .ix. yere of Adeulphus then kynge of westsaxons / the whyche as before is sayd was surnamed Ballyd.
                     Anon as his father was buryed / his brother Lothayre, to whome the father, as ye fore behaue harde, had cōmyttyd ye guydynge of this Charlys, by the entysynge of his brother Lewys malygned agayn this Charlis / and sought many wayes to put hym from such landes as his father had gyuen hym. This sayd Lothayr was after the deth of his father emperour / and Lewys the yonger brother was duke or knyght of Bayon. But for Charlis was yongest, and had to his parte the pryncypall porcyon of Fraunce, whych was called myddell Fraunce / therfore his .ii. bretherne &amp; specially Lewys, malygned greuously agayne hym. wherof this Charlis beynge somdeale infourmed / bare hym so wysely &amp; so egally to his subiectes, that he hadde theyr loues and fauours / and trustyd alway by theyr good ayde that he shulde be of power to wythstande theyr vnkynde malyce. And lyke as the hydde fyre in processe breketh oute and shewyth great lyght and flammy blase, euen

so dyd thys couerde malyce at the laste breke oute, to great ire and opē wrath. For after foure yeres was passyd / the sayde two bretherne with oute defyaunce or groundely cause of warre, assygned or assembled a great hoste / suche lyke before thys daye hadde not ben sene / and entryd the lymyttes of kynge Charlys.
                     Then Charlis assembled in all ye haste hys lordes / and requyred theyr aydes and counsayll to wythstande the malyce of hys bretherne. And when he hadde knowelege of theyr good myndes, anon theyr knyghtes were gaderyd and all thynge was redy to the fyghte.
                     Nowe in thys whyle the two bretherne wyth theyr peple were comen to a place callyd Fountayns or Foū
                        tanet, where to Charlis spedde hym. And when both hostes were nere / eyther partye made prouysyon to subdue his enymye.
                     Then were the bataylles on bothe partyes orderyd &amp; assygned to theyr standardes and capytaynes, and the wynges set to the moste auauntage. what shuld I lenger processe of this ordynaunce make, fynally the shote of arblasters beganne on both sydes whyche ouer threwe many an horse and man / and specyally the fore rydars, that putte theym selfe in prese wyth theyr longe and sharpe launcys, to wynne the fyrste brunte of the felde.
                     Pytye yt was to beholde the goodly bryght armyd knyghtes, lyēg and walowynge wyth theyr great stedys in the felde, wyth dedly woundes gapynge agayne the son, yt were slayne at the fyrst encountre. But when the shote was spent, and the speres to shateryd / then both hostes ranne to gyther wyth Rowlandes songe / so that in shorte whyle the grene felde was dyed into a perfyte redde. For there was heddes, armes, legges, &amp; trunkys of ded mennys bodyes lyenge, as thycke as floures growe in tyme of maye in the floryshynge medowys / myserable and pyteouse yt was to beholde the persones halfe lyuynge and halfe ded / with theyr grysely woundes pyteously gronynge and cryenge wythoute comforte. So that there was shewyd all rygoure wythoute mercy, and all crueltyes wythout compassyon.
                     Thus duryd this mortall fyghte by a longe season / that doutefull yt was to knowe whyche partye hadde thauaūtage of other. Howbeit Charlys was putte to an afterdeale by .ii. meanes. The fyrste was for so mych as Charlis entendyd to haue forborne, for the reuerence of the hygh feste as the daye of the ascensyon of oure lorde, &amp; that daye not to haue foughten. And the seconde was, that he was farre lesse in nomber. whyche two causes of dysauaūtage not with standynge / yet in the conclusyon he wanne the honoure of that iourney. But not wythoute great losse of hys peple and many of the nobles of his lande / where of the frenche boke rehersith the names. But for they be to vs vnknowen, I passe theym ouer. And as yet is testyfyed of many wryters / there was slayne that daye mo Frencheman, then was slayn at any felde euer before that day. wherof the nomber is not expressyd / for yt was so great. Then Lothayre was forced to take Aquisgrany for his safegard, and Lewys ellys where. But Charlys wyth a small cōpany that to hym were lefte / folowed his Bretherne, and cōstrayned Lothayre to forsake ye citye, &amp; thens to go vnto Lyon a cytye ye standeth at this day in the vtter most border of Fraūce, &amp; after to Uyenne. To ye which citye of Uyen shortly after came vnto hym hys brother

Lewys / where they two assembled a newe hoste.
                     In the whych passetyme, as Charlis was comynge towarde hys bretherne / messyngers mette with hym, sent from his bretherne to comon of a peace. So that fynally he was accordyd, that the realme of Fraunce shulde be dyuyded in .iii, as the father had before dysposyd yt. That is to meane, Lothayr shuld enioy ouer the landes belongyng to the empyre the countrey of Austracy / the whych in processe of tyme was called Lothayre or Lotharingia, whyche is to meane Lorayne after his name. And to Lewys shulde remayne the prouynce of Germany, wyth the coūtrey of Buyan or Benery. And to Charlys shulde remayne the countrey called myddell or chefe Fraunce, wyth the prouynces of Normandy &amp; Burgoyne. whyche sayde myddle Fraūce is reportyd to be in space from ye Occean of Brytayne to the ryuer of Mawze.
                     The whyche concorde thus fermely stablyshed and fynyshed / eyther of other toke theyr departynge, and resorted vnto theyr owne lordshyppes. But Lothayre dyed shortely after / leuynge after hym thre sonnes, named Lewys, Lothayre, and Charlis. But this deth of Lothayre is not taken for temporall deth / for yt is sayd yt he forsoke the trauayle of ye world, and became a munke at the abbaye of Pruny, and lyued there a solytary lyfe many yeres after.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXIIII. CHAPITER.
                     CHarlis ye Ballyd thus beyng in peaseble possessyon of the chefe parte of the realme of Fraunce, and guydynge yt wyth all sobernes and indifferēt iustyce / was well drad and also beloued of his subiectes.
                     In processe of tyme, as vpon .viii. yeres after that Lothayr abouesayd renouncyd the pompe of the worlde / dyed fyrste Charlys the yongest son of the thre of the foresayd Lothayre. And after dyed Lothayre the second sonne / so that the sayde Lewys onely suruyued, whych was after his father enoynted emperour.
                     when Charlis kynge of Fraunce knewe certaynely of the deth of these two forsayde brethern, and that with out yssu / anon he assembled his power and entred the prouynce of Austracy or Lorayne / the which his brother Lothayre hadde gyuen to Lothayre his sonne. And in shorte whyle after crowned hym kynge of that prouynce, wythin the chyrche of saynte Stephan of the cytye of Meaws, chefe cyty of that lordshyppe &amp; kyngdome. wyth the whyche dede Lewys his brother, and kynge of Germany and Bayon was dyscontentyd / thynkyng hym selfe more ryghtfull enheritour then Charlis, for so myche as he was ye elder brother, and also brother to the fyrste Lothayre of father &amp; of mother / where as Charlis was but halfe brother, and by the fathers syde onely.
                     For this ye sayd Lewys sent to Charlys the Ballyd certayn messyngers / gyuynge to hym monycyon that he shulde call to memory the couenauntes betwene theym before tyme stablyshed / and that he shulde not meddell hym nor haue to do wythin the landes of his cosyn lately deed, vnto such tyme as yt were determyned by theyr bothe counsayles, whyther of theym hadde the better ryght / &amp; this to be obseruyd vppon payne of excō
                        munycacyon or cursyng.
                     But for to Lewys was well sene, that his brother Charlis nothyng absteyned hym from the occupyenge of the forenamed countrey / he therfore

gaderyd an armye to warre vppon his sayde brother.
                     In the whych passe tyme Charlys toke to his second wyfe a woman namyd Rychent or Ricent / the whyche he before tyme hadde vsyd as his cō
                        cubyne or paramoure.
                     And soone after the Danys or Normans inuadyd the landes of Charlys / the whych for that tyme he was fayne to appease &amp; please wyth ryche gyftes and other pleasures.
                     Then Charlys receyued from his brother a seconde ambassade or message / the whyche shewyd vnto hym excepte he wold voyde his knyghtes and strengthes, that he had sette and put in dyuerse places of the lande of Austracy, he shuld be sure to haue of his sayd brother an enymy / and that in all haste he wolde entre his lande wyth great force and warre. wheruppon was suche answere sente, that by both theyr agrementes the mater was hadde in suche cōmunycacyon / that fynally yt was agreed that the sayde landes shulde egally be departyd betwene them. whyche conclusyon perfyted. Lewys wyth his people retournyd into Germany.
                     But yt was not longe after that Lewys repented hym of hys agrement / so that newe legacyons were made vppon both partyes / and lastely wyth myche payne newly agreed. After whyche agrement and accorde fynyshed / Lewys the emperour and sonne of the fyrste Lothayre, sente an ambassade to both the fornamed bretherne / admonestynge and warnyng them that nother the one nor ye other shulde intermyt wyth the foresayde landes, for so myche as the ryghte therof belonged to him as next heyre to his brother / and not to them that were a degre forther. The answere of this was deferryd by Charlys / how be it his brother Lewis as sayth myne authour, gaue ouer his parte shortly after to Lewys ye emperour.
                     In this passe tyme Charlys the sonne of Charlis the Ballyd by hys fyrste wyfe, whome the father had made ruler of a countrey called Belge / hadde rulyd hym insolently, and done in that countrey dyuerse outragiouse dedes. For the whyche he beyng cōplayned of, was brought vnto his father / and so by hym commaundyd to pryson. But shortely after he was deliueryd at ye requeste of some nobles of Fraūce / &amp; kept after in his fathers courte, where he contynued but a shorte whyle. For wythin a lytle season after his father beynge at Lyons / he departyd from ye sayde courte, and gaderyd to hym a wylde company of euyll dysposyd persons, and went agayne into the sayd countrey of Belge / and dyd more harme then he had done before season / and so contynuyd a long whyle. But lastly he was taken and caste agayne in pryson / where after longe punyshement he was reued of his syght / and then sent vnto the monastery of Corbenyke, there safely to be kepte. But at length by the entycemēt of his vncle Lewys kynge of Germany, and the treason of two mūkes of ye place / he scapyd thens, and fledde vnto the sayd Lewys his vncle. In the which tyme Charlys his father was occupyed in the defence of the Danys or Normannys, that then by strength had wonne the citye of Angyers and done therein myche harme / whome the kynge closyd wythin the sayd cytye wyth a stronge syege, and fynally compellyd theym to seke meanys of peace at the kynges pleasure. After whych peace cōcludyd, and the sayd Danys auoydyd / the kynge repossessyd the sayde cytye.
                     It was not longe after, that tydynges were brought vnto Charlis

of the deth of Lewys the emperoure. After knowlege wherof / the kynge sent hys other sonne named Lewys into Austracy, to haue the rule and ye guydynge of ye countrey. And after other thynges ordered for ye weale of hys realme / he wyth a stronge company of men of armys passyd ye moū
                        taynes, and so into Italy towarde Rome. But Lewys hys brother and kynge of Germanye beynge therof warnyd / sent in all haste hys sonne Lewys wyth a stronge hoste to lette hys passage. But how it was for fere or other meane / the sayd Lewys yeldyd hym to hys vncle Charlys the Ballyd. wherewith the father beyng greuously dyspleasyd / sent hys seconde sonne namyd Charlō, to withstande the passage of the sayd Charlys. But thys for fere or other cause that he sawe that he myghte not preuayle agayne hys vncle / retornyd hym agayne to hys father. After whose retorne, he for so mych as the sayd Lewys kyng of Germany well perceyued that hys brother Charlys was paste his daunger / he than with a more nomber ioyned vnto his sonnes hoste, entryd ye londe of Fraūce, in domagynge it to the vttermoste of hys power.
                     In whyche season Charlys the Ballyd kepte on his iourney toward Rome. wherof heryng the .viii. Iohn̄ than pope / sent agayne hym certayn persones of honoure, and welcomyd hym as Augustus or emperour. And after hys comynge thyther the sayde pope receyued hym wyth greate reuerence / and crowned hym wyth the imperyall dyademe and denouncyd hym as emperoure.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXV. CHAPITER.
                     CHarlys ye Ballyd thus beyng authorysed for emperour / exersyd hym for a tyme for the nedys of the chyrche of Rome / &amp; after toke hys leue of the pope &amp; retorned vnto Papye a cytye of Italy. where he callynge a generall counceyle of the lordes of the empire &amp; other / he by theyr aduyses prouyded and ordered dyuerse thynges for the weale of ye sayd empyre. And ouer that by theyr agrementes he ordeyned for hys lyeu tenaunt or debyte of the sayde empyre in hys absence, a noble man brother to hys wyfe recent named Besonne or Beson / and assygned to hym such people as was thought necessarye and conuenyent.
                     whan Charlys had sped hys nedys in Papye, he hyed hym into Fraunce. But or he came wythin the terrytory therof / word was brought to hym that hys brother Lewys was retorned into hys owne countreye, wythout greate domage done to the realme of Fraunce.
                     In processe the emperoure came to Parys / where he was receyued of the cytesens wyth moste tryumphe &amp; ioye / and kepte hys Eester tyde at saynte Denys.
                     It was not longe after that Charlys was thus returnyd into Fraūce / but that he receyued messengers frō hys brother kynge of Germany, the which in his name claymed his part of the empyre as hys ryghte and enherytaunce. whiche answere for that tyme was deferryd with pleasaunte wordes / so that at the nexte worde yt he hadde from his sayd brother, was that he was dede and buryed in the chyrche of saynte Nazer in Frankeborught. wherof whā Charlys was ascerteyned, anone he yode vnto Foū
                        tenays / and sent hys messengers to the lordes of the countrey, commaū
                        dynge them that they shulde meete hym at the cytye of Mettes.
                     Thys foresayd Lewys lefte after hym two sonnes named Lewys and

Charlon as before is towched / the whych deuyded bytwene them theyr fathers patrymony / so that Lewys had Germany, and Charlon hadde Bayon.
                     Thys Lewys ferynge hys vncle Charlys / gaderyd to hym a stronge power of Saxons and of Thorynges. And in the tyme of theyr assemble / he sent an ambassade of certeyne byshhoppes &amp; temporall lordes vnto hys vncle Charlys, prayeng hym of hys loue and fauour / wyth other requestes to hym made, of the whyche they myghte purchase no graunte. wherof whan they were retornyd he hauynge by them knowlege / ye sayde Lewys incontinently wyth his hoste drewe nere vnto the Ryne. But thys Lewys was not so couert ī his work and assemblynge of hys people / but that hys vncle had therof wyttynge, and purueyed hys people as faste vppon that other syde / so that he wyth an hoste was redy to fyghte with the sayd Lewys.
                     whan Lewys was ware of ye great power that the emperour hadde assembled, he made no haste to passe ye water / but houed and caused his people to falle vnto prayer. And Charlys also ferynge hys neuewe / vnder a colour sent alegacyon of entreaty. Durynge the whyche entreaty / the emperour contrary to hys honoure, led his peple by a secrete waye thynkyng to haue fallen vpon his neuew sodeynly, and by that meane to haue dystressyd hym. But Lewys beynge ware of hys vncles treason / prouyded so for hys peple, &amp; kepte them in suche araye, that they receyued theyr foo men vpon theyr speres poyntes &amp; to theyr great damage. For where the greate rayne and tedyousnesse of the harde and strayte wayes, whych they hadde passyd, hadde sore tyred and weryed them: than the fresshe fyersnesse of theyr enemyes, whyche they thoughte they shulde haue takē slepynge and vnpurueyed, abasshed thē in such wyse that they were soone ouercomen, and fled from the felde as shepe fle frō the wolfe. By meane of the whych flyght great slaughter of them was made / &amp; many nobles &amp; greate estates of Fraūce both slayne and taken prysoners / and the emperoure hym selfe scapyd wyth greate daunger. And of the prysoners that were takē they were so nere spoyled / yt they were fayne to take vyne leues to couer wyth theyr secrete mēbres.
                     ye shall vnderstand y• thys warre bytwene the emperoure Charlys the Ballyd and hys brothers sonne Lewys / was for the prouynce of Austracy or Lorayne, the whyche somtyme belonged to the emperoure Lothayr and halfe brother to Charlys. The whych countreye after thys batayle, was by medyatours set in an order.
                     Than the emperoure wyth great trauayle came to a town called Tyguy. And Lewys kepte hys waye to Dandonyquyke / and from thens to Ayes the chapell.
                     In this whyle the Danes or Normans knowynge that Charlys was occupyed in the warre agayne hys neuewe / apparayled them a stronge hoste, and entred ofte the landes of Fraunce. But for Charlys was at ye tyme letted wyth chargeable busynesse / he therfore sent a noble man agayne them called Comarde, vnto the ryuer of Sayne, to wythstande the sayde enemyes. And also to hym was gyuen counceyle, to haue wyth them cōmunicacyon to make a peace yf he myghte.
                     And to thys trouble immedyatly was ioyned another. For ī this tyme and season a cytye belongyng to the chyrch of Rome rebellyd. wherfore to wythstand theyr malyce / the pope

than beynge Iohn̄ the .viii. of that name, sent messengers to Charlys for the defence of the sayd lōdes and other. And soone after the pope for to haste the sayd emperoure, or ellys to quyckē his deputye before named to assemble the Italyans and other people there adioynaūt / came downe to the cytye of Papye, &amp; taryed there the emperours comynge.
                     Charlys thā beset with trowbles / assembled hys knyghtes &amp; sped hym towarde Italy. And whan he was passyd the mountaynes / worde was brought to hym of the popes beynge in Papy / wherfore he sped hym thyder with all dylygence.
                     In thys tyme &amp; season Charlone the brother of Lewys and sonne of Lewys kynge of Germany / whyche Charlone as before is shewyd was duke of Bayon or Bayory / gaderyd a stronge hoste, and entred the boundes of Italy. wherof herynge ye pope and the emperour, than (as before is sayd) beynge at Papye, busyed in a great counceyle / dissoluyd the same. And the pope incontynētly toke leue of the emperour / &amp; departyd agayne to Rome. And Charlys wyth a great power that he had gaderyd, as well of Italyans as of hys owne people / made towarde hys neuewe. wherof herynge the sayde Charlone / turned agayne by the waye that he had comen, tyll he came to hys owne countrey, as sayth myne authour &amp; also ye French boke. But more verely Charlone kepyng togyther hys hoste, and hauynge fauour of dyuers lordes of Italye / the emperoure Charlys remouyd to ye cytye of Mantue / where he was grudged wyth a feuer. For remedy wherof he toke a pocyon of a physycyon Iewe named Sedechias, whyche was intoxicat / by meane of whych venemous pocyon he dyed shortly after whan he hadde reygned as kynge &amp; emperoure after moste accorde of writers, by ye space of .xxxvii. yeres, wherof he reygned as emperoure .iii. yeres / leuynge after hym a sonne named Lewys, whyche as before is shewed was ruler of the coū

                     whan thys Charlys was dede / hys frendes entendynge to haue caryed the corps into Fraunce / causyd it to be seryd and enoynted wyth ryche and precyous bawmes, and other oyntmentes and aromatykes. But all myghte not stoppe the intolerable ayre of hys body / so that they were fayne to bury hym at Uercyle, wythin the monastery of saynt Euseby. where he laye ouer .vii. yeres after / and then taken vp and conueyed to saynt Denys in Fraūce, and there honorably buryed.

                     IN the tyme of thys Charlys the Ballyd, as wytnessen many wryters, began the erledome of Flaunders / the whyche euer before these dayes, the ruler therof was called the forester of the kynge of Fraū
                        ce. whyche erledome had hys begynnynge by thys meane.
                     ye haue harde before in the story of Adeulphus kynge of westsaxons / how in hys retornynge from Rome, he maryed the doughter of Charlys ye Ballyd named Indith. The which Indyth after the deth of her sayde husbonde retornyd by Flaunders towarde Fraunce / thynkynge to passe wythout daunger, bycause the sayde countrey was vnder the obedyence or her father. But at those dayes was ruler or forester in that partyes a noble yonge amerous man callyd Bawdewyne / the whyche herynge of the great beautye of thys Indith, gaue attendaunce vppon her. And receyued her in hys best maner, makyng

to her all the chere that to hym was possyble / and fynally cast to hyr suche loue, that whan she supposed to departe and to haue gone into Fraunce / he delayed the mater in suche curteys and wyse maner, that he wan such fauour of her, that she made no greate haste to departe frome hym / all be it that moste authours agre, that he kepte hyr perforce.
                     whan Charlys hadde wyttynge that Bawdewyne thus helde hys doughter Indith / he sent to hym, straytly chargynge hym to sende home hys doughter / but that holpe not the mater. Thā he purchasyd agayn hym the censures of holy chyrch, and accursed the sayd Bawdewyne. But whan the kynge conceyued that the yonge man hadde suche loue to Indyth that he sette not by that punysshement / and also was certeynly enformed that hyr harte was gyuen vnto hym: he in processe by ye meane of some bysshoppes and frendes of the sayd Bawdewine, agreed that he shulde take hyr to wyfe / and in the name of hyr dowar, he shulde holde and enioye the sayd countre of Flaū
                        ders. And for he wolde haue hys doughter to be the more honoured / he creatyd the sayde Bawdewyne an erle, and commaunded hym to be called after that daye erle of Flaūders.
                     It is also shewyd in the Frenche cronycle and of other wryters / that thre dayes before hys deth, hys spiryte shulde be rauysshed from hys body, and vnto places of payne and turment / where thys Charlys by the ledynge of an aungell, shulde se hylles and mountaynes brenne, &amp; pyttes full of sulphyr, pytche, and hote boylynge lede. In whyche paynes the sayde Charlys shulde se many of hys progenytours and bysshoppes, that counceyled prynces to debate or stryfe, or gaue counceyle to them to rayse of theyr subiectys vnlefull taskys or imposycyons / wyth many other thynges, whyche I passe ouer for length of the mater.

                        EThelwaldus or Ethelwoldus ye eldeste sonne of Adeulphus, began hys reygne ouer the westesaxons or ouer ye more partye of Englande, in the yere of our lorde viii. hundred and .lv / and the .x. yere of Charlys the Ballyd than kynge of Fraunce. The whyche became so vnhappy / that he maryed ye woman whyche hys father hadde somtyme kepte or holden for hys concubyne, as wytnessyth ye authour of ye Floure of hystoryes. But Polycronycon sayth that he wedded his stepmoder / whyche dysaccordyth wyth the sayenge of other wryters, which testifye his stepmoder to be maryed to Bawdewyn erle of Flaūders, as in ye story of Charlys last before is shewyd.
                     Thys Ethelwolde though it be not expressyd by what hap he dyed, whan he hadde reygned one yere, as sayth Polycronyca. But another cronycle beryth wytnesse, that he was slayne as a martyr, of Hungar and Hubba prynces of Danys.
                     About thys tyme the holy kynge saynt Edmund cōtynued his reygne ouer the Eest Anglis or Norfolke.

                     EThelbertus the seconde sonne of Adeulphꝰ / began his reygn ouer the more partye of Englande, in the yere of our lorde .viii. hundred lvi / &amp; the .xi. yere of Charlis ye Ballid

then kynge of Fraunce. In whose tyme the Danys wyth more strengthes entred ye west part of this land / and robbed and spoyled the coūtrey before theym tyll they came to wynchester / &amp; toke the cytye by strength, and dyd therin what they wold. But the kynge made suche prouysyon / that by hym &amp; his dukes they were forcyd to forsake the cytye. And as they yode toward theyr shippes / they were fought wyth, and a great parte of theym slayne and taken.
                     Of this kynge is nothynge ellys lefte in memory more then before is shewyd / but that he dyed when had reygned after moste wryters .vi. yeres / and was buryed at Shyrborne, leuynge after hym none yssu of hys body. wherfore the rule of the lande fell to his brother Etheldrede.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXIX. CHAPITER.
                     ETheldredus the thyrde sonne of Adeulphus / beganne hys reygne ouer the west Anglis and the more parte Englande, in the yere of our lorde .viii. hundred &amp; .lxiii / &amp; the xviii. yere of Charlis ye Ballyd then kynge of Fraunce.
                     In the begynnyng of this kynges reygne, the Danes landed in eest England or Norff. and Suff. But they were compellyd to forsake that countrey / and so toke agayne shyppynge and saylyd northwarde, and landed in Northumberlande. where they were mette wyth of the kynges then there reynynge callyd Osbryghte and Ella / whyche gaue to theym a stronge fyghte. But that not wythstandynge the Danys wyth helpe of suche as enhabyted ye countrey, wan the cytye of yorke, and helde yt a certayne of tyme.
                     Then the people of Northumberland varyed with in them self / &amp; had more leuer ayde the Danys then to reygne vnder the kyng of westsaxōs. For here is to be notyd that all such kynges as reygned there after Egbert, whyche as before is sayde subdued that prouynce and other / reygned as trybutaryes to the kynge of of westsaxons or Anglys.
                     wherfore Etheldredus herynge of the auauntage that the Danys then had, assembled his people and sped hym thytherwarde / and sente vnto the foresayd two kynges, commaundynge them also to prepare theyr peple agayne hys cōmynge. But howe yt was or the kynge came wyth hys hoste / the Danys so prouokyd the Northumbres to batayll, that they met in playne feld &amp; foughte a longe batayll. But finally the Danys wan the pryce / and slew both the foresayd kynges wyth a great multytude of theyr people.
                     After whych vyctory they subdued myche of the sayde countrey, and destroyed ye town of Aklynt or Aclynd / the whyche, as testyfyeth Beda, was somtime one of the strongest townes of the Northe.
                     when Etheldrede hadde preparyd all thynge for the warre / and was purposyd towarde the North, for cō
                        syderacyon aforesayde: worde was brought vnto the sayde kynge Etheldrede of the dyscomfyture of the Northumbres / and also of dyuerse of the sayde Danys wyth other that were comen to Mercia, and hadde wonne the towne of Snotyngham or Notyngham / whyche tydynges lettyd hym of his forth spedde in that iourney. But thys sayenge is dysagreable vnto Policronicon. For he sayth that the Northumbres were yet of theyr kynge Osbrutus or Osritus after some authours / and chase vnto thē a tyraunt named Ella / by meane wherof great dissensyon grew amōg

them to the great hurte of the countrey. But when the Danys hadde passed the countre, and wonne the cytye of yorke, that then was febly wallyd: then by constraynte and of fere, for the defence of theyr coūtrey, they were fayne to agree and to gather strengthe on all sydes / so that bothe the foresayde kynges went agayne the foresayd Danis, and both were slayn. After whych scomfyture the people as desolate / some fledde the countrey, and some made peace wyth the Danys, and lyued vnder theyr tuycyon. And so the Danys kepte the possessyon of that coūtrey / in suche wyse that no Angle hadde rule therof, tyll the time of Adelstone or Ethelstone, or after some wryters tyl the tyme of Edredus / so that they helde the possessyon therof ouer the terme of .lx. yeres.
                     Then the Danys beynge thus possessyd of the Northe countrey / manned the same, &amp; fortyfyed the stronge holdes therof. And the other of them came downe into Mercia or myddell Englande / and wanne a parte therof wyth the forsayde towne of Nothyngam / and dwellyd there ye more parte of the yere folowynge.
                     wherfore kynge Etheldrede wyth ayde of Burdredus then kynge of Mercia, layde seage vnto the towne. The whyche when the Danys perceyued shulde be wonne / they refusyd the towne, and toke the towre or castell, and defendyd yt in so stronge maner, that they helde yt tyll a peas or apoyntement was concludyd betwene the two kynges and theym. whyche was that they shulde go free where they wolde, and carye wyth theym theyr horse and harnesse wythout any pyllage. And whē this peace was thus made, eyther of the kinges departed to theyr owne / and the Danys retourned vnto yorke, &amp; dwelled there the yere folowynge.
                     And the yere folowynge that sayde yere / a parte of the sayde Danys takynge shyppynge in the Northe, entendynge to sayle towarde eest Englande / mette in the see wyth a flote of Danys, wherof the captaynes or ledars were named Hynguoar &amp; Hubba. The whyche by exhortacyon of the other commynge oute of the North / made all one course, and lastly landed in eest Englande or Norffolk / and in processe of time came vnto Therforde.
                     Therof herynge Edmundus then kyng of that prouynce / assembled an hoste, that gaue vnto them batayll. But Edmūde and his hoste was forsed to forsake ye feld / &amp; the kyng with a few persones fledde vnto the castel of Framilynghā or Framyngeham / whome the Danys pursued. But he in short whyle after yelded hym selfe vnto the persecucyon of the Danys. And for this blessyd man Edmunde wolde not renye or deny Cryste and hys lawys / they therfore moste cruelly bonde him vnto a tree, and causyd hym to be shot to deth / and lastely causyd his hedde to be smytten from the body, &amp; caste amonge the thycke of the bushes. But when his frendes came after to burye this holy treasoure and lacked the hed, and made for yt busy serche / the hedde beyng in the clawys of a wylde wolfe spake, &amp; sayde thre tymes dystynctely, here, here, here. By reason of whyche speche they came vnto ye place where the hedde in the sayde bestys kepyng laye. whyche sayde wolfe contrarye to his kynde / anon as he sawe the people, fledde from the hedde and suffred theym to take yt vp / and folowyd theym after a certayn of tyme as he hadde ben rame.
                     Then they wyth great solempnyte caryed the body and hed vnto Eglydon

or Eglysdon now callyd saynte Edmundes bury / and there buryed hym, aboute the yere of our lorde as wytnessen Policronica, Guydo, and other, viii. hūdred. &amp; .lxix / as before it is shewyd in ye chapyter of this worke foure score &amp; .xiv, for whom dayly god shewyd there many miracles.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXX. CHAPITER.
                     WHan this blessyd Edmūde was thus martyred for the loue that he bare towarde his mayster Criste and his lawes / his brother named Edwoldus settynge a parte the lykynge and pleasure of the worlde, all be yt that to hym belongyd the ryght of that kyngdome, toke vpon hym the habyte of an heremyte, and lyued onely by brede and water at the abbay of Cern̄ in the countye of Dorset / by the clere welle that saynt Austyne by his prayers made to sprynge, when he conuertyd fyrst the Saxons of that prouynce to ye fayth of Cryste.
                     Of this said abbay of Cerū, Policronica sayth yt it was after these dayes ryche and ryght welthy. But the gouernours therof mysspent the patrymony therof in excesse glotony, &amp; not amonge the seruauntes of god.
                     wherfore he sayth farther, that couetyse and pryde hadde so chaūged all thyng in England in these days / that all thynges that before tyme were gyuē to abbays, were then more wasted in glotony and outrage of the owners, then in sustenaunce and ayde of nedy men and of gestes or nedy waygoers. Albe yt he sayth the fyrst doers or gyuer lose not theyre rewarde. For theyr wyll and entent is full euenly paysed in a balaunce, before hym that is the rewarder of all good. But though Treuysa yt was the translatoure of this boke of Polycronycon out of laten into our vulgare tunge / reporte this to be done, or thys mysorder to be vsyd in thys dayes, whyche lyued in the tyme of that honorable prynce Edwarde the thyrde / yf he now lyued, he wold not in no gouernours of munkes blacke or yet whyte, laye no suche outrage. For nowe at these dayes pryde and glotony is clerely banyshed frō theyr monasteryes and cellys / and in the rome of pryde wyth hys frende dysobedyence, haue they now lodgyd humylyte with his suffer obedyence. And in the stede of glotonye and vnclēnesse of lyuynge / haue they nowe newely professyd them vnto all chastyte, temperaunce, abstynence, auoydynge all slowth and idelnesse / and exercyse theym in gostely studye and preachynge of the worde of god wyth all dylygence. So that nowe the holy rulys &amp; ordynaunces made by that holy father and abbote saynt Benet, which by ignoraūce haue lōg tyme slepte / nowe by grace of good gouernaunce are newely renyued and quyckened. And here and ende, lest I be accused of dyssymulacyon.
                     Then to retourn vnto the Danys, from whome I haue made a longe dygressyon / trouth yt is that when they hadde as before is sayde, martyred the blessed man Edmunde, and robbed and spoyled that countrey / and they toke agayne theyr shyppes and landed agayne in Southerye / and there contynued theyr iourney tyll they came to the towne of Redynge, and wanne the towne wyth the castell.
                     Policronyca sayth yt the thyrd day of theyr thyther cōming / Hingwar &amp; Hubba as they wente in purchasyng of prayes, were slayne at a place called Engelfelde. whyche prynces of Danys thus slayne / the other dele of theym kepte hole to gyther, in suche

wyse that the weste Saxons myght take of theym none auauntage. But yet wythin few dayes after the Danys were holden so shorte, that they were forced to yssue out of the castell, and to defende theym in playne batayll. In yt whych by cōforte of kyng Etheldrede and of Alurede his brother / the Danys were dyscomfyted, and many of theym slayne. wherof the other beynge ware / fled agayne to the castell, and kepte theym wyth in the same a certayne of tyme.
                     Then the kynge cōmaunded Etelwold then duke of Baroke or Barkshyre, to attende wyth hys peple vppon that castell / &amp; to se that the Danys breke not oute at large while he went in other costes of that countrey to subdue other of the sayde Danys But when the Danys knewe of the kynges departure / they brake out so daynly anon of theyr hold, and toke the duke vnpuruayed &amp; slewe hym and myche of hys people / and caused the other to with drawe them farther from that towne or castell.
                     Then these Danys drewe them to other that were theyr lordes in that coūtrey / and enbatelled them in such wyse, that of theym was gatheryd a stronge hoste.
                     It was not long after duke Ethel wolde was slayne, but the kyng was ascertayned therof. The whyche renewed his heuenesse, and made hym full heuy / to consyder the losse of his frende, and the encreace and multyplyenge of his enymyes. For ye daye before reporte of these tydynges as affermeth an olde cronycle / worde was brought to hym of the landyng of a Dane named Osryk, whyche of Policronyca is named kyng of Denmarke. The whyche in shorte tyme after with assystence of the other Danys / hadde gaderyd a great hoste, and were enbatellyd vppon ashe downe. To his batayll Alured was forced by great nede to come before his brother the kynge, that then was herynge of a masse wyth great deuocyon, not knowynge of that hasty spede of his brother. where ye kynge thus beynge in hys medytacyons / ye hostes of Anglys and Danys strake to gyders wyth houge vyolēce. And how be yt the Danys hadde won the hyllande &amp; ye crysten men were in the valley / yet by grace and vertue of ye kynges holy prayers and manhode of theym selfe, they at length wanne the hyll of the Danis, and slew theyr duke or kynge called Osryke, or after the englyshe cronycle Oseg, and fyue of theyr dukes, wyth myche of theyr people / and chased ye other dele vnto Redynge towne.
                     wherfore the Danys resembled theyr people, and gathered a newe hoste / so that wythin .xv. dayes they mette at a towne called Basynge Stoke / and there gaue batayll vnto the kynge, and hadde the better.
                     Then the kynge gatheryd his people, the whych at that felde were chachyd &amp; dysparklyd / and wyth freshe soldyours to theym accompanyed, mette the Danys within two monethes after at a towne called Merton / and gaue to theym a sharpe batayll, so that myche people were slayn as well of the crysten as of the Danys. But in the ende the Danys hadde the honour of the felde / and the kynge of Anglys was wounded, and fayne to sauegarde hym selfe by polycy when myght fayled.
                     After these two feldes thus won by the Danys / they obteyned great cyrcuyte of grounde, and destroyed man and chyld that to them were inobedyēt. And chyrches and temples they tourned to vse of stables, and other vyle occupacyons. And to this sorowe was added an other.
                     
                        For where the kyng hoped well to recouer his losses by ayde of his subiectes, as wel of other ꝑtes of his land as of hys owne of westsaxon / when he hadde sent his commyssyons into Northumberland into Mercia, and éest Anglia: He had of them small or lytell comforte / so that the coūtre of west Saxon was brought in great desolacyon. For the kyng was beset wyth enymyes vpon euery syde / and ouer that his knyghtes and soldyours were tyred &amp; palled wyth ouer watche and laboure. whyche manyfolde aduersytyes and troubles synkynge in the kynges mynde / wyth brose or hurte ensuyng of the woūde before takē at ye batayll besyde Merton, shortened his dayes / so that he dyed when he had reygned in great persecucion of the Danys after most wryters .viii. yeres, wythout yssue of his body. By reason wherof the rule of the lande fyll vnto hys brother Alurede.
                     It is wytnessyd of some cronycles that not wythstandynge the great trouble and vexacion that this kyng Etheldrede hadde wyth the Danys, he founded the house or college of chanons at Exeter, and was buryed at the abbaye of wynbourne or wobourne.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXXI. CHAPITER.
                     ALuredus the .iiii. sonne of Adolfus &amp; brother to Etheldredus laste kynge / beganne his reygne ouer the westsaxons and other prouynces of Englande, in the yere of our lorde .viii. hundred &amp; .lxxii / and the .xxxi. yere of Charlis forenamed, then kyng in Fraunce. This Alured or after some wryters Alphred was xii. yere of age or he were set to scole. But for all that he spedde so well his tyme, that he passed his brother and other that were long set forth before hym. And by the counsayll of Neotꝰ or Notꝰ / he ordeyned the fyrst grammer scole at Oxenford, &amp; other free scoles, and fraunchaysyd that towne wyth many great lybertyes / &amp; translated many lawes, &amp; Marcyan lawe and other, out of Bretyshe speche vnto Saxon tunge. He was also a subtyll mayster in buyldyng and deuysynge therof, and excellent connyng in all huntynge. Fayre he was of stature / and moste beloued of his father of all his chyldren.
                     Longe tyme it wold aske to reherse all his vertue. But for he was in his youth dysposed to ye syn of the fleshe, and thereby letted from many a vertuous purpose: he lastely after many resystences by hym done to auoyde ye temtacyon therof / besought god enterly, that he wold sende to hym som contynuall sykenes in quenchyng of ye vyce, &amp; that he were not vnprofytable to wordely besynesse &amp; serue god the better.
                     Then at goddes ordynaūce he had ye euyll called Fycꝰ / wyth the whych sekenes he was greued many yeres, and lastely cured of that holy virgyn saynt Modwenna then dwellyng in Irlande. But after this cure by her done she came into Englande, for so myche as her monastery or chyrch yt she there dwelled in was destroyed. wherfore Adulfus father to Alured, knowynge the vertue and holynesse of this mayden / gaue to her ground to buylde vppon .ii. abbays of maydens. That is to say one in Arderne at a place callyd Polliswortham, another at Strenesalte in the Northe. But this holy mayden dyed in the yland of Andrese besyde Burton, after many yeres of the buyldynge of these sayd two abbays, &amp; after .vii. yeres yt she had ben closyd within stone walles in the yle before named.
                     when Alurede was cured of this sekynes,

to him fyll an other / the which contynued with hym from the .xx. yere of his age tyll the .xlv. yere of hys sayed age. But yt not wythstādynge he wedded a noble woman named Ethelwyda / of the which he receyued two sonnes, Edwarde surnamed the elder, &amp; Egelwarde / &amp; .iii. doughters, Elphleda yt after was ladye of Mercia Ethelgota a mēchon or nūne, &amp; ye thyrd was named Elfrida. The whyche he caused all as well doughters as other▪ to studye the arte or scyence of grāmer, &amp; to be noryshed wyth all vertue. And when this Alurede was admyttyd to be kynge, he well consyderyd the great daunger yt his lande was in. wherfore he gaderyd to hym his lordes / &amp; suche as he myghte not wyn wythout stryfe, he wanne wyth great iustyce and fayre hostes. So yt he shorlty assembled a stronge hoste / and in the seconde moneth yt he was made kynge, he mette wyth the Danys besyde wylton, &amp; yelded to them batayll, but not wythout great losse of men on both partyes.
                     Then he remeuyd his pleople, and in sondry places faught wyth ye Danys in the fyrste yere .vi. tymes. By meane wherof his peple were so sore mynyshed and wekyd / that he was forsed to take peas wyth his enymyes, vppon couenaunt that they shuld auoyde the countres &amp; prouynces yt he had domynyon of.
                     Uppon whych agremēt fermely concluded the Danis for a tyme voyded those coūtreys / &amp; drew towarde London, &amp; rested theym about ye coste the more parte of the yere folowynge / &amp; from thens to Lyndesey, in robbyng and spoylyng the townes &amp; villages as they wente, &amp; holdynge ye cōmon people vnder theyr seruage / &amp; so contynued ouer the terme of two yeres. But or the thyrde yere were endyd they yode vnto Repindon / and there put down or slewe Burdredus then kyng of Mercia / and betoke ye kyngdome vnto a seruaunt of his named Colwolphus, vppon condicyon on that he shulde kepe it to theyr behofe. And then they besegyd a town thereby called Hambourgth, &amp; assauted yt right sharpely. wherfore the people therof beynge in great drede and fere / toke the body of that holy vyrgyne saynt werbourgth, by vertue of whose body the enymyes were somwhat put a backe. And after for a more suerty / ye inhabytauntes of ye towne of Hamburgth wyth that holy treasure, fled vnto westchester / where at this daye she lyeth honorably shryned.
                     Then the kyng made oft peas with the Danys, in truste wherof he rode with the fewer peple, wherof they beyng ware, layd bushemētes for hym, &amp; set so nere hym, yt they slew a great parte of his cōpany in a nyght as he rode towarde wynchester.
                     For this treason the hyng was sore amouyd agayne the Danys / &amp; in as secrete maner as he myght he assembled a chosen cōpany of knyghtes / &amp; as wytnessyth Guydo, fyll vpon thē sodeynly, &amp; dystressed many of them, and lefte them not tyll he had chased them to Chester, or after an other authour to Exetour. And there kynge Alurede kept the Danys so short / yt he constrayned them to gyue to hym pledges to kepe the peace, &amp; to dwell no lenger there then they myght puruey shyppynge at the next porte to sayle into Denmarke.
                     After which accorde thus fynyshed the kynge returned vnto Mercia or myddell England. And for he harde yt Colwolphus was dede, to whom the Danys had taken that lordshyp to kepe: he therfore seasyd yt kyngedome, and ioyned yt to his owne of west Saxons. By whych reason the kyngedome of Mercia surseasyd ye
                        
had continued from theyr fyrst kyng named Penda, as in the chapyter of this worke .C.xxix. precedynge, is more at length declared.
                     Aboute the .v. yere of the reygne of Alurede / the Danys as affermeth Policronica, sayled fro warham towarde Exetour / in the whyche iourney they loste .vi. score of theyr small shyppes by a tempeste in the see. But some of them occupyed the towne of Chepynham and the countrey therunto adioynynge / and chasyd ye Angles, or made them as subiectes to ye Danys. And so sore the power of thē augmentyd / that the Angles loste dayly and they encresyd / and ye more by reason of the landyng of a prynce of the Danys named Gutteron or Gowthram, whyche ys named kyng of Denmarke.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXXII. CHAPITER.
                     ALurede beynge thus ouerset in multytude of enymyes, as affermeth Policronica &amp; other / ladde an vncertayne lyfe and vneasy wyth few folkes aboute hym, in the wode coūtrey of Somersetshyre / and had ryght scante to lyue wyth, but suche as he and hys peple myght purchase be huntyng and fyshynge. In which mysery he thus by a certayn of tyme contynuynge / he was by a vysyon to hym shewyd of saynte Cutbert comforted, as folowyth. Uppon a tyme when his cōpany was from hym departed &amp; besyed in purchasyng of vytayle, and he for a passetyme was redynge on a boke / a pilgryme came to him and requyred his almes in goddes name. The kynge lyfte vp hys handes towarde heuen and sayde, I thanke god that of his grace, he vysyteth hys poore man this day by an other poore man / and that he woll wytsaue to aske of me yt he hath gyuen to me. Then the kynge anon called his seruaunt that hadde but one lofe and a lytell what of wyne / and badde hym gyue the halfe therof vnto the poore man. The whyche receyued yt thankefully / and sodaynly vanished from his syght, so that no step of hym was sene in the nesshe fenne or more yt he passed thorough. And also all that was gyuen to hym / was lefte there by in such wyse as yt was to hym gyuen. And shortely after his company returned to theyr maister / and brought wyth theym great plenty of fyshe that they had then taken.
                     The nyght folowynge when the kynge was at his reste / one apperyd to hym in a byshoppes wede, &amp; chargyd hym that he shuld loue god, and kepe iustyce, and be mercyable to the poore men, and worshyppe prestes. And sayd more ouer, Alurede Criste knowyth thy cōscience and thy wyll, and nowe wyll put an ende of thy sorowe and care. For to morow strong helpers shall come to the, by whose helpe thou shalte subdue thyne enymyes. who arte thou sayd the kyng. I am Cutbert sayd he, ye pylgryme yt yester day was here with yt / to whom thou gauest both brede and wyne. I am besy for the and thyne wherfore haue thou mynde hereof when yt is wel with the. But how he had his pilgryme in mynde after, by the fredam that he gaue with the possessyons vnto Durham chyrche / yt is well and euydently sene.
                     Then Alurede after this vysyon, was wel comforted, and shewed hym more at large / so that dayly resortyd to hym men of wylshyre, Somersetshyre, &amp; Hamshyre / tyll that he was strongly companied. Then the kyng put hym in a great ieoꝑdye, as sayth wyllyam de regibus. For he dyd on hym the habite of a mynstrell / &amp; with his instrument of musyke, he entred

the tentes and pauylyons of the Danys / and in shewynge there his enterlude &amp; songes, he espyed all theyr slouth and idelnesse, and harde mych of theyr counsayll / and after retourned vnto his company, and tolde to theym all the maner of the Danys.
                     Then the kynge wyth a chosen cō
                        pany / fyll vpon ye Danys by nyght, and dystressyd and slewe of theym a great multytude, and chasyd theym from that coste. And when the kyng had thus chasyd the Danys / by coū
                        sayll of his knyghtes, he buylded there a toure and named it Edelyng, whyche is to meane in oure speche a toure of noble men. Oute of whych toure he and his soldyers made many assautes vppon theyr enymyes, &amp; dyd to them myche harme &amp; scath / and clerely voyded the countrey of them betwene that and Selwood.
                     This Edelynge or Ethelyngyssey, standeth in a great marys or more / so that men may not wyn to yt withoute shyppe or bote, and conteynyth no great grounde / but yet therin is venyson and other wyld bestes, and fowle, and fyshe great plenty.
                     Thus kynge Alurede dayly pursuyd his enymyes by helpe of god &amp; his subiectes / whyche heryng of his vyctoryes and manfull dedes, drewe to hym dayly out of all costes. By whose powers and assistens he helde the Danys so shorte / that he wanne from them wynchester, &amp; many other good townes / and forced them lastly to seche for peace, the whych was cō
                        cludyd vppon certayn couenauntis. wherof one and principall was / that theyr kynge named as before is sayd Guttrun or Gothram, or after ye Englyshe cronycle Gurmunde, shuld be crystyned, and a certayne of his dukes wyth hym. And for ye kyng wold haue the Danys banyshed out of the west partyes of Englande / he graunted to hym eest Anglia to abyde and dwell in.
                     Then this prynce of Danys accordynge to the couenauntes, was crystyned at wynchester / and .xx. of the grettest of his dukes. And to this sayde Danys prynce Alurede was godfather at the funte stone, and named hym Athelstane. And after he hadde a season feasted the sayde Daues / he accordynge to his promys
                           •
                         gaue vnto theyr kynge the countrey of eest Anglia, whyche then conteyned Norffolk and Suffolk, &amp; parte of Cambrydshyre. And also as wytnessyth Policronica he graūted to ye Danys that were crystened the countrey of Northumberlande. And the other that wold not be crystyned, departed the land &amp; failed into Fraūce / where they restyd theym wyth theyr cosyns and Kynnesmen, that at those dayes wasted the lande of Fraunce, as in the frenche storys is somwhat apparent. when this Danys kynge Athelstane hadde the possessyon of these countreys / ye shall vnderstand yt all suche Angles as dwelled there, and wythin the precyncte of theym, were vnder his obedyence. And all be yt that he helde the sayd prouynce as in fee of ye kyng, and promysed to dwell there as his lyege mā / yet that promyse not wythstandynge, he contynued lyke a tyraunte by the terme of .xi. yeres full, and dyed in the .xii.
                     In the whyche tyme kynge Alurede amended the cytye of Septon̄ that nowe is called Shaftesburye / and other townes and stronge holdes yt by the Danys were sore abatyd and enpayred. And as wytnessyth Guydo and other / he buylded ye house of nonnes at Shaftesbury, or was fyrste founder therof.
                     He also founded an house of relygyon in the aboue named place of Ethelyngesey / and a nother in wynchester,

that was named the new monastery. In the whiche he was after buryed. And ouer this he endowed the churche of saynte Cuthberte in Doreham, as before is touched.
                     Aboute the .xv. yere of the reygne of Alurede / ye Danys whiche before as ye haue hard sayled into Fraūce, retorned into Englande and landed in Kent / and so lastly came vnto Rochester and beseged that cytye / and lay there so longe, that they buylded a towre of tymber and not of stone, agayne the gates of the cytye. But by strength of ye cytesyns that towre was destroyed, and the cytye defended tyll kyng Alurede restowed thē. The whyche hadde made suche purueyaunce for the dystressyng of them by water and lande / that they were so nere trapped, that for fere they left theyr horses behynde them and fled to theyr shyppes by nyght. But whā the kynge was therof ware / he sent after them &amp; toke .xvi. of theyr shyppes, and slewe many of the sayd Danys. After thys iourney, the kynge retorned to London / and repayred certayne placys therof, that before had ben hurte or febled wyth the Danys / and betoke the guydyng therof vnto Etheldredus than erle or duke of Mercia, to whom as wyfe he had gyuen hys doughter Elfleda.
                     About thys tyme dyed Dunbertus than bysshop of wynchester / and the kyng made Dunwolfus bysshop after hym. The whyche as sayth Polycronycon the kynge fande in the wodde kepyng of bestes, in the tyme whan he hym selfe kepte the woddes for fere of the Danys.
                     About the .xxi. yere of the reygne of thys kynge Alurede / the Danys landed in .iiii. places of thys lande, that is to wytte in the Eest England and the North, and in the west in .ii. places. But for ye kynge before theyr landynge had warnynge of the deth of Athelstan̄ kyng of Danys of Eest England, and of other complayntes of ye Danys / he therfore yode thyder in whyche tyme of hys there beynge these tydynges came vnto hym.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXXIII. CHAPITER
                     WHan kynge Alurede was acertayned of these tydynges / for so mych as some of the sayde Danes were landed in that coste, and knewe well that ye ferther they drewe vnto these partyes, the more they shulde be ayded and strengthed: he therfore sent messengers in all haste vnto Etheldred erle or duke of Mercia / chargynge hym to assemble an hoste of the men of Mercia and the border there about / and to make resystens agayne the Danes, whyche landed in the west. And that done / ye kyng sped hym toward hys enmyes, and pursued them so sharpely, that in ye ende he droue them out of Eest Anglia. The whyche than landed in Kent / whyther the kynge wyth hys people spedde hym, and in lyke maner draue the Danes from thens. How be it of any specyall fyghte or batayle authours therof leue no memory. After thys agayne the Danes toke shyppynge &amp; sayled into North wales, and there robbed and spoyled the Britōs / and from thens retorned by the see into the Eest Anglia, and there rested them, for so mych as the kynge than was gone westwarde.
                     In thys whyle some of the foresayd Danys had wonne the towne of Chester. But for the countrees adioynaūt presed so sore vppon them / the sayd Danys were compelled to kepe them wythin the sayd towne or cytye, and to defende theym by that maner. But that holdyng of ye towne lasted so longe, that the Danys were

compellyd to eate theyr horses for hunger. But by apoyntement they lastely gaue ouer the towne, &amp; went thens into Northumberland. And in the whyle that the kynge with his hoste spedde hym thyderwarde / they leuynge the stronge holdes and castels garnysshed wyth men and vytayle, toke agayne shyppynge &amp; fet theyr course in suche wyse that they landed in Sussex / and so came vnto the towne of Lewes, and from thens toward London / &amp; buylded a towre or castell nere vnto the ryuer of Lewes. But the Londoners heryng of theyr doynges, māned out a certayn nomber of men of armes / the whiche wyth assystens of the men of ye countree, put the Danys from that towre and after bete it downe to the groūd.
                     Soone after ye kyng came downe thyder / and for he thoughte that ryuer shulde be a meane to brynge enemyes efte soones into that countre: therfore he cōmaunded ye streme to be deuyded into diuers stremes / so yt by reasō therof there a shyp myght sayle in tyme afore passed, thā a lytell bote myghte scantly rowe. Than by presence of the kynge, the Danes were forsed to fle that countre, and from thens toke agayne waye toward walys, and kept a parte of the ryuer of Seuerne / &amp; vppon the border therof buylded them a castell nere vnto walys, &amp; so rested them there for a tyme. So that .iii. yeres after thys lande was vexed wyth thre maner of sorowes / wyth warre of the Danes, pestylence of men, &amp; moreyne of bestes. whyche troubles &amp; aduersytees not wythstandynge / the kyng knyghtly and manfully resysted the malyce of his enmyes / and thanked god alway what trouble so euer fyll to hym or to hys realme / and susteyned it with greate humylyte and pacyence.
                     It is tolde of hym yt he deuyded ye daye and nyght in thre partyes yf he were not let by warre or other greate besynes. wherof .viii. houres he spēt in study and lernyng of scyence / and other .viii. he spente in preayer and almes dedes wyth other charytable dedes / &amp; other .viii. houres he spent in his natural reste, sustinaūce of his body, &amp; the nedes of the realme. The whych order he kept duely by waxen tapers kepte by certayne persons.
                     Thus thys marcyall knyght contynuyng in all prowesse and vertue, lastly dyed / whan he hadde reygned ouer the more parte of thys lande by the terme of .xxviii. yeres full. And was fyrst buryed at wyltō, and after certayne yeres remoued and caryed vnto wynchester / leuynge after hym a sonne named Edwarde, surnamed Edwarde the elder. For the other b

                        other called Egelwarde dyed before hys father.
                  
                  
                     Francia. THE .CLXXIIII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        LEwys the second of that name, and sonne of Charlis ye Balled / began hys reygne ouer the Frenchmen, in the yere of our lorde .viii. hūdred lxxviii / and the .vi. yere of Aluredus than kynge of the more parte of Englande. Thys was named Lodowicus Balbus, whych is to meane Lewys the stamerer / for so mych as he had an impedyment in hys tunge.
                     ye haue before in ye story of Charlys the Balled herde, How Charlon the neuew of Charlys foresayd, with hys hoste had entred Italy, and entended towarde Rome. The whyche after the deth of his sayd vncle Charlys, kepte on hys waye, &amp; lastly came

vnto Rome. But for the pope than beynge Iohn̄ the .viii. of that name / fauoured the aboue named Lewys Balbus, and entended to make hym emperoure: therfore he refrayned yt enoyntyng of the sayd Charlon. For the whyche dede he fynally was compelled to auoyde the towne &amp; coūtre, &amp; fled into Fraūce. where he beynge honourably of Lewys receyued / declared and admytted hym for emperoure, as sheweth the Cronycles of Rome. But after two yeres of hys reygne or short tyme of thys admyssyon to that dygnyte, thys Lewys dyed. wherfore the sayde pope to enioye hys papasy in reste / retorned to Rome, and anoynted the forenamed Charlon, and crowned hym with the imperyall dyademe / the whyche in ye Roman̄ cronycle is named Carolus tertius, the thyrde emperour, that is to meane of that name.
                     But of all thys speketh nothyng the Frenche Cronycle / excepte that it is there testyfyed, that he was of the sayd pope admytted for emperour.
                     Polycronycon sheweth, that the seconde Lewys kynge of Fraunce, was accursed of the pope Nicolas ye fyrste of that name / for so myche as he refused hys lawfull wyfe, &amp; toke to him his concubine named waldrada. But that is vnderstande by Lewys the second emperour of that name / whyche was sonne of Lothayre, whyche Lothayre was eldest sonne of Lewys the mylde, as in the story of Charlys the Ballyd appereth. And for the genelogy of Charlis the conqueroure, or of hys ofspyng may the clerelyer appere / and also that ye reder may haue the more certeyne of the names, whych were emperours, whych kynges of Fraunce, &amp; whych were kynges of Germany: I shall in the story of Lewys the .v. (in whome for a tyme surseasyd ye blode) make a remembraunce of euery emperour, &amp; kynges of Fraunce &amp; Germany, that reygned from ye sayd Charlis ye grete or conquerour, tyll Hugh Capet / the whyche Hugh vsurped the crowne of Fraunce, as after shall appere.
                     Than it foloweth in the story, that for partycyon of the lande of Austracy or Lorayn, grudge and varyaūce contynued alwaye bytwene the kynges of Fraūce &amp; Germany / whyche bothe kynges at thys daye were named Lewys, albeit that the kyng of Fraunce was surnamed Balbus, as before is shewed. For the whych varyaunce by laboure of frendes these two kynges mette at ye cytye or place called Gundeuyle. where after longe cōmunycacyō it was fynally agreed, that the sayde prouynce of Austracy shulde than be deuyded, as it somtyme had ben parted bytwene Charlys the Balled and Lewys kynge of Germany theyr bothe fathers.
                     After whych peas thus cōcluded, eyther parted from other in frendely wyse. And Lewys Balbꝰ yode vnto Ardern̄, where he halowed the feste of Crystmas. And frō thens he yode vnto Compeyne / where he herde of the rebellyon of a marques of hys realme called Barnarde, or more verely after the Romayn story a marques of Italy. For thys Barnarde wyth one Helberde had before tyme taken from the chyrche of Rome certeyne possessyons / whyche by meane of thys Lewys &amp; the sentence of the chyrche denounced agayne them by the foresayd pope Iohn̄, were agayn restored, and the partyes also reconcyled. But now of newe thys Barnarde rebelled agayne. wherfore the pope as to Lewys for the defensour of the chyrch of Rome sent for ayde / for, as before I haue shewed you, thys Lewys of the sayde pope Iohn̄ was authorysed for emperoure. But

for he was not crowned at Rome wyth the imperyall dyademe / he is not accōpted amonge ye emperours.
                     For thys newe rebellyon of Barnarde, Lewys assembled hys armye at Cōpayne foresayd / and frō thens rode to ye cytye of Troyes in Uincēt, where he was taken wyth sodayne malady, of ye whyche he dyed shortly after, and not wythout suspeccyon of venym, whan he had ben kynge of Fraunce fully two yeres / leuyng after hym two sonnes, that is to saye Lewys and Charlys, or after some wryters Charlemayne.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXXV. CHAPITER.
                     LEwys and Charlys / the sonnes of Lewys Balbus or Lewys ye stamerer / began theyr reygne ouer the Frenchemen, in the yere of oure lordes incarnacion .viii.C.lxxx / and the .viii. yere of ye reygne of Alurede than kynge of Englande. The whyche for they were yonge of age, were put vnder tuyssyō and gydyng of Barnarde the erle of Auuergii / to whom the father by hys lyfe had thē commytted. wherfore the sayd Barnarde wyth other of hys affynyte assembled shortly after at Meaux in Lorayne / &amp; thyder called vnto them the lordes of the lande, to treate maters for the comon weale of ye same.
                     In those dayes was a man of grete myght in Fraūce named Gosseleyn̄ / the whyche enuyed the foresayd erle Barnarde &amp; other, for certayne harmes to hym by them done in tyme be fore passed. In auengynge wherof the sayd Gosseleyn̄ intended to putte hym and other from the rule of the land, whych he knew well they shuld occupye whyle the sayd two childern had rule of the same.
                     And thys euyll purpose to brynge to effecte / he went vnto Conrade erle of Parys, and shewed to hym moche of his wyll. And amonge other thynges lette hym wytte, that yf Lewys kynge of Germany myght with hys helpe be made kynge of Fraūce / that he shulde by hym be greatly auaunced. By whych meanes he caused the sayde Conrade to take hys parte / so that he &amp; other of hys affynyte whan they came vnto the foresayde counsayle at Meaux / sayde that Lewys kynge of Germany, was more apte to rule the lande of Fraūce than any other was. And also after some wryters / these Lewis and Charlys afore sayde were not the legyttymate sonnes of the forenamed Lewis Balbꝰ, but gotten in baste of a concubyne of the sayd Lewys.
                     Thys mater thus debated and argued amonges the coūsayle / lastly by moste in nomber it was agreed, that Lewys kynge of Germanye shulde be by ambassade requyred to come and take vppon hym the rule of the lande of myddell Fraunce. The whych wyth small request was agreable / and in shorte tyme after came vnto the sayd cytye of Meaux, and after to Uerdune. But as soone as the knowlege was come to Barnarde and other of hys affynyte / by counceyle of Hughe and Terry two nobles of Fraunce, the bysshop of Orlyaunce with an erle and other were sent to Uerdune vnto the sayd kynge of Germany wyth thys message. That yf he were contente to take vnto hym all suche parte of the prouynce of Lorayne, as Charlys the Balled kepte from hys fader Lewys, wythout more clayme of the lande or realme of Fraunce / he shuld gladly haue it. And yf nat, he shulde abyde the iugement of Mars and hys batayle. wyth whyche offer Lewys was well contented / and beyng of it in a suertye, departed agayne into Germanye.
                     
                        Thorough that doynge, the forenamed Gosselyne and Conrade with other of theyr frēdꝭ, were with yt sore dyscōtentyd of the departure of Lewys forsayde. But the sayd Bernarde with other of his syde, in goodly hast after cōueyed the sayd two chyldren vnto the citye of Ferrer / &amp; there crowned and proclaymed theym for kynges, as wytnessyth mayster Robert Gaguyne. But the forenamed Gosselyne and Conrade not leuynge so the mater / sente messengers vnto ye quene of Germanye, cōplaynynge theym vnto her of the vnstablenesse and tymerousnesse of her lorde / wherby he had not alonely loste the possessyon of the realme of Fraunce, but also he hadde put them and all theyr frendes in great fere and daunger. wherof herynge the quene / in her mynde was sore dyscontentyd wyth her lorde and husbande, and as she durste shewyd yt to hym as his reproche and dyshonour. And fynally to satysfye the myndes of the sayde Gosselyn̄ and Conrade, she sent into Guyan her brother named Boso / by whose aydes and assystence he was of that prouynce proclaymed kynge.
                     Endurynge whyche troubles / the Danys entred the lande, and came vnto the ryuer of Lyger, and robbed and spoyled the countrey wythoute mercy. wherfore the kynges assembled theyr people / and gaue to them batayll nere vnto the ryuer of Uyen. where they dystressyd the sayde Danys and slewe of them .ix. thousand, and drowned of thē ouer that a grete multytude in the sayde ryuer. After whyche vyctory by the kynges obteyned / a new vexacyon &amp; trouble was to them ascertayned, yt Lewys kyng of Germany with a great puysaunce was comen vnto a place called Ducy / and to hym was gone the forenamed Gosselyn̄ and Conrade with all the power that they myghte make / &amp; by theyr ledynge was from thens cō
                        ueyed vnto Rybemaunt. But howe so yt was, for lacke of performaunce of promyse made by the sayde two erles vnto the kyng of Germany &amp; not obserued / he herynge of the kynges of Fraunce drawynge towarde hym wyth stronge hoste, cōcluded a peas, and retourned into Germany. And the two bretherne rode to gyder vnto the citye of Damens or Demeus / where they deuyded the lande of Fraunce betwene theym. So that Lewes held to hym the coūtrey nere &amp; about Parys, with the prouince of Neustria or Normandye / and Charles had vnto his part Burgoyn and Guyan / with promyse made &amp; assured on eyther partye, that eyther of them shulde ayde and assyste other.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXXVI. CHAPITER.
                     AFter this partycyon betwene the two bretherne thus made / by the meanes of Lewys kynge of Germany the foresayde erles Gosselyn̄ &amp; Conrade were vnto the sayde bretherne recouncyled and agreed. And for to theym redy worde was brought, y• Bose before named kyng of Guyan hadde wonne the cytye of Uyen / &amp; therin lefte his wyfe whyle that he occupyed ye hylles and mountaynes beynge there aboute: they ioyntly assembled theyr knyghtes, &amp; sped thē thyther, &amp; layde theyr seage aboute the cytye. But durynge this syege the Danis often wasted ye land of Fraunce. wherfore Lewys the elder brother, departed frō that syege / leuynge there his brother Charlys. But or the sayde Lewis myght wyn to the sayde Danys, they as tyrauntes and cruell enymyes to Crystes fayth, hadde spoyled many chyrches and temples, and a monasterye of

saynt Peter in Corby, and throwen yt downe to the ground. After which vyle and cruell dede by theym done / Lewys gaue vnto them batayll, and slew of them great nomber, and chased the remanaunt.
                     But after this vyctorye ensuyd a great wonder. For when the crysten hadde as before is sayde chasyd the pagans or Danys / they retourned as confusyd and dysparkled, lyke as all the hoste of Danys hadde theym pursued / so that well was hym that myghte ronne fastest, and hyde hym selfe from the daunger of his enymy. For yt was thought to them and apparent to theyr syght, that theyr enymyes folowed at theyr backes wyth all kynde of wepyn / and yet folowed thē no man. The whych fere &amp; flyght of Frenche men, as sayth myne authour, was sent to theym by dyuyne purueaunce / for so myche as they so often before tyme had won the pryce of theyr enymyes, and had not therfore gyuen due thanke vnto god, but referred yt to theyr owne strenghtes and vertue.
                     Then the Danys herynge of this dysparklyng of the crysten hoste / reassembled theyr power and ppayred them to new fyght. wherfore ye kyng called to gyther his knyghtes, so as before is sayd dysparkled / and mette wyth theym nere vnto the aboue named ryuer of Lyger. But when both hostes were wythin a days iourney / the kynge was aduysed by some of his coūsayll, yt he shulde not as then fyght wyth thē. For the whych cause he yode vnto Compeynge, and there kept the feast of Crystemasse.
                     And whyle the kynge was lodged in Cōpeynge / he delyueryd his hoste vnto a noble man of his land named Theodorych / wyllynge hym to go agayne the Danys. Of whose exployt or spede myne authoure maketh no mencyon / but sayeth that soone after the foresayde feast, the kynge spedde him to Turon̄ / where he sent to rayse the Brytōs of lytell Britayn to with stande the foresayde enymyes.
                     In the whyche passetyme he was there taken wyth a maladye, &amp; from thens in a lytter caryed vnto saynte Denis, where he dyed &amp; was buried. Or as sayth maister Gaguyn, he dyed at Turon̄, and was after cōueyed vnto saynt Denys, and there buried. But for all wryters ioyne the reygn of these two bretherne in one / therfore I wyll now shewe vnto you the fyne or conclusyon of the other brother called Charlys or Charlemayn / the whyche all thys whyle mayntened the syege aboute Uyenne, where his brother as before is touchyd left hym. To whom the lordes of Fraū
                        ce sente in all haste, gyuynge to hym knowlege of the deth of his brother / and also of the great daunger that the land was in by reason of the Danys. wherof when the sayd Charlys hadde thus wyttynge / he lefte a parte of hys people at the sayde syege, and wyth the other deale he sped hym towarde Champayne, for so mych as he was enfourmed that the Danys were drawen towarde that coste. And as he was in hys iourney / worde was broughte vnto hym that Uyenne was delyueryd vnto suche persones as he hadde there left to maynteyne the syege.
                     And after thys came a nother messenger / whyche shewyd to hym that the Danys hadde destroyed dyuers chyrches in Champayne and other places / and howe the byshoppe of Meaws that agayne theym hadde ladde an host of people, was of them slayne, and hys people chasyd / and ouer thys at the foresayde ryuer of Lyger an other hoste of Danis, with theyr leder called Hastynges was assembled.

The whych in that partyes wasted the countrey as the other in other places dyd / whyche somdeale apasled the herte of the kynge Charlys. How beyt by the comforte that he hadde dayly receyued from the lordes of Fraunce / he kepte on hys iourney, and made towarde the next of his enymyes.
                     But when he drew nere vnto them / were yt for his own cowardyse, or of the counsayll of his lordes / he fell to a communycacyon of peace. And fynally concluded that Godfrey the prynce of Danys, to cōfesse the fayth of Cryste and to be crystened / shulde enioye the hole prouynce of Fryse. And wyth in the same / he wyth hys Danys to inhabyte theym.
                     The whyche condycyon of peace was the begynnynge of greate sorowe and losse vnto Fraunce, as after shall appere. For all be yt that the sayd Godfrey to deceyue the Frenchmen, shewed outwarde countenaūce to be crysten man for a whyle / he shortely after wyth an hoste of .xl. thousande Danys, entred the land, wastynge the countrey tyll he came to Parys / and layde there hys syege about the same citye. But by the arch byshoppe of Parys then named Iosselen̄, and the inhabytaunces of the same, the cytye was manfully defended / so that he with his Danys was fayne to breke hys syege / and from thens yode to the cytye of Laon̄, and wan yt by strength / and after yt spoyled and robbed, and after brent. And fro thens to Soysons in pyllynge and destroyeng the countrey as they went, in so cruell wyse, that the bysshoppes and prestys fled from theyr chyrches, wyth relyques and anournamentes or ornamētes belongyng to the same / as the bodyes of saynte Germanye, saynte Remigius, and dyuers other.
                     In ye tyme of this persecucyō / lyke as the lande of Englande was in great daunger, so also was the land of Fraunce / by meane of these pagans or myscreauntes Danys. The whyche resortyd from that one realme to that other / and releued theym selfe in that one land, whē they were chased oute of that other. But one myshappe amonges other befell in Fraunce at these dayes. For Charlys theyr kynge was taken from theym in suche wyse, that no wryter leueth of hym any mencyon how he dyed, nor when he dyed / nor no mencyon is made in the frenche cronycle nor of myne auhoure, howe longe whyle he and hys brother Lewys reygned. All by Uyncent historyall, and Antoninus, whych groūded hym vppon the sayde Uyncent, and Iacobus Philippus saye / that these two foresayde bretherne regned togyder and alone, by the terme of .v. yeres wythoute more.
                     And the frenche cronycle and also myne authour sayen, that Lewys dyed wythoute heyre / and that Charlys lefte after hym a sonne, whyche was named Lewys, and after for his symple dedes surnamed in laten Nihil faciens, or in frēche Ryen fezant / whyche is to meane in our speche nought doynge.
                     But who that lysteth wele to aduertyse &amp; remēber the order of thys cronycle / he shall fynde in this latter sayenge some dyscorde. For where yt is sayde that thys Charlis shulde leue a sonne after hym, to my yt semeth, that consyderynge hys youth he shulde not be of any lawfull age to gette a chylde. For by all lyklyhode of conuenyence of the storye / yf all be veryfyed as yt is before declared / he coude not passe ye age of .viii. yeres at the moste.
                     wherfore yt muste folowe of a congruence

/ that other they reygned lenger tyme, or ellys thys chylde or heyre Lewys aboue named, was the sonne of some other man. But to folowe myne authour I shall procede as foloweth.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXXVII. CHAPITER.
                     LEwys the fourth af that name, and sonne of Charlis as before is sayde / beganne his reygne ouer ye Frenchmen, in the yere of our lorde .viii. hundred .lxxx. &amp; .vi / and the .xiiii. yere of Aluredus then kyng of Englande. Of thys Lewys yt ys testyfyed of dyuers wryters, that he shulde enamoure hym selfe vppon a menchon of the monastery of Chyell, and her drawe oute by force, and marye her vnto his wyfe. For the which dede and other, he purchasyd the aboue said name / &amp; was called Lewis nought doynge.
                     In thys tyme the Danys, contrary to theyr ꝓmyse before made / made new warre wythin the land of Fraū
                        ce. wherfore the Frenchmen hauyng lytell hope in theyr kynge / sente vnto Charlon or Charlys ye emperour, sonne of Lewys kynge of Germany as before is shewyd / requyryng him in all humble wyse to vysyte ye realm of Fraunce / and to defende yt from the persecucyon of the Danys.
                     In these dayes also was lyuynge in Fraunce the forenamed Hugh / whych as ye before haue herd / maynteyned the quarell of Lewys &amp; Charlys last kynges, agayn Lewys kyng of Germanye. The whyche Hugh of some writers is called Hue le graūd, that is Hugh the great. Thys man gaderyd an hoste of Frenchmen, and gaue batayll vnto the Danys, and slewe of them a great nomber.
                     It shulde seme by the wryters of the frenche storye, that these noble men of Fraunce, as thys Hugh and other, shulde haue the rule of the spyrytuall possessyons of abbayes and other houses of relygyon. For of myne Authour mayster Gagwyne, they are in laten named abbates / and in the Frenche boke abbis, whych is to meane abbottes.
                     And also yt is testyfyed of the sayd writers / that this Hugh and Robert erle of Parys, were the fyrst that left the dystrybucyon of those spyrytuall goodes vnto theyr knightes / &amp; gaue ouer that name of abbotte, the whyche in some other estates contynued tyll the dayes of Roberte kynge of Fraunce.
                     Then yt folowyth, accordynge to the request made vnto the emperour as aboue is shewyd / he gatheryd a stronge hoste of Italyons, and parced the lande of Fraunce / and bare hym so vyctoryously agayne the Danys, that he forced theym to obey to all theyr former promyse &amp; condycyons. But Eusebiꝰ and other yt wrote the actes of the emperours / sayen, yt this Charlis whyche they name the thyrd of y• name, and also Grossus, yt is great / subdued the Danys of Fraunce, &amp; compellyd theyr leder or prynce named there Rodefredus, to take the habyte of Crystes relygyon, and receyued hym at the coulde wa / ter. In whyche tyme or soone after (wherof ye tyme is not duely ascertayned) dyed the forenamed kynge Lewys surnamed nought doynge / when he hadde reygned after most wryters viii. yeres / leuyng after hym a sonne named Charlis, yt whyche after was surnamed symple. But for he was to yonge to take vpon hym such a charge / the lordes put hym vnder good &amp; conuenyent guydynge / and chase an other as foloweth to guyde ye lande tyll he were come to hys laufull age, whyche was named Eudo.
                  
                  
                     
                     THE .CLXXVIII. CHAPITER.
                     EUdo the sonne of Robert erle of Angeowe / beganne his reygne ouer the French men, in the yere of our lorde .viii. hundred .lxxx. &amp; .xv / and the .xxiii. yere of Alurede then kynge of Englande.
                     ye shall vnderstand that the aboue named Robert erle of Angeow was as tutor and guyder vnto the forenamed kynges of Fraunce Lewys and Charlys / and lastely was slayne of the Danys. The whyche Robert left after hym .ii. sonnes, Eudo and Robert. whych Eudo for the great fame that he was of, and also for ye great trouth that in hym was prouyd and knowen / ye lordes of one assent chose hym to be kynge of the lande for the terme of his lyfe. And as affermeth the french boke &amp; other he was crowned of walter then archebyshoppe of Senys.
                     Howe be yt this is somdele doutfull to be gyuen credence vnto, for dyuers reasons that therunto myghte be made. Mayster Gagwyne sayth, that he hath sene some authoures, that testyfye this forenamed Charlis the symple, to be the lawfull son of Lewys Balbus / and the foresayde Lewys and Charlis late kynges of Fraunce, to be the bastarde sonnes of the sayde Lewys Balbus.
                     Then to folowe the mater, thys Eudo in cōsyderacyon that the sayd Charlis the symple was insuffycyēt to guyde the lande, he was putte vnder the guydyng of this sayd Eudo / and he was made kynge in his stede. The whyche myghtly defendyd the lande from all daunger of enymyes. And ouer yt he caused the sayde Charlys the symple to be noryshed and broughte vp wyth moste dylygence / so that he was informed &amp; exercysed wyth all vertues doctrine, and other thynges necessarye vnto a prynces son. And finally when this noble and vertuous knyghte Eudo knew yt he shulde dye / he called before hym the lordes &amp; nobles of Fraunce / yt whych he charched by solemne othe, that after his deth, they immedyatly shulde crowne Charlis for theyr kyng / and dyed soone after, when he hadde reygned as affermeth authours by the terme of .ix. yeres.
                  
                  
                     Anglia. THE .CLXXIX. CHAPITER.
                     
                        EDwarde surnamed the elder and son of Aluredus / began his reygne ouer ye more part of England, in ye yere of our lord .ix hundred &amp; one / &amp; the .vii. yere of Eudo then kynge of Fraunce. This was lower then hys father in letter and connynge / but he was hygher in honoure &amp; worshyp. By his fyrst wife he had a son named Ethelstane, the whych was kynge after hym. By his seconde wyfe he had two sonnes Edredus &amp; Edwynus / &amp; vii. doughters. And of ye thyrd wyfe he receyued two sonnes, Edmunde &amp; Edrede / and two doughters Edburga and Edgina.
                     The fyrste of these .iii. wyfes hyght Edwyna the second hyght Edgina / &amp; the thyrde was named Ethleeswyda. Of ye forenamed .vii. doughters, which he had by his second wife / one named Alunda or Almyda, was maryed to the fyrst Otto the emperour. And a nother named Algina, was maryed to Charlis the symple kyng of west Fraūce. And the yōgest of his doughters as sayth Policronica / he wedded vnto Lewys kyng of Guyan. But therof speketh nothyng the

frenche cronicle. He set his sonnes to scole / and his doughters he sette to woll worke, takyng exemple of Charlis the conquestour.
                     By authoryte of Formosus the pope, he made .vii. byshoppes in Enlande. wherof he ordeyned .v. in west Saxon, one in southe Saxon, &amp; one in Mercia at Dorchester. He also for that the munkes of wynchester sayd that his father Alurede walkyd / caused hym to be remoued vnto the new abbay. About the .v. yere of his reygne Clyto Ethelwaldus a nere kynnesman of his / rebellyd agayn hym, and occupyed ye towne of wymborne besydes Bathe / &amp; toke thens by force &amp; nunne / &amp; went thens vnto the Danys dwellyng in Northūberlande, &amp; excyted them to ryse agayn kyng Edwarde. But the kynge pursued hym so sharpely, that he was constrayned to leue the countrey / and sayled into Fraunce, and lefte the nūne behynde hym / the whych the kynge caused to be restoryd agayn to the house yt she was taken fro.
                     The nexte yere folowyng, the sayd Clito wyth his cōpany landed in eest Englande, &amp; gaderyd to hym ye Danys of that countrey, and with theyr ayde destroyed and pylled the countrey about Crekynforde &amp; Criklade. And then passed ye ryuer of Thamis &amp; spoyled the land to Bradenestoke / and so frō thens retourned into eest Anglia, yt is Norffolke &amp; Suffolke.
                     The kynge folowed his enymyes and spoyled of theyr landes, whyche they helde by composycyon from the ryuer of Owse, to the bordure of saynte Edmundus lande / commaundynge hys knyghtes of hys hoste that none shulde dragge or tarye after hys hoste, for fere that they were not beclyppyd of theyr enmyes. But the Kentyshe men, whych trusted to myche in theyr owne strength, dysobeyed that commaundement. wherfore the Danys awaytynge theyr praye / fyll vppon them by bushementes, and slewe the more partye of theym, wherwyth the kyng was sore dyscontentyd.
                     Soone after bothe hostes mette. where after longe fyght Clyto wyth many of the Danys was slayne, and the remenaunt constrayned to seche peace / the whyche was graunted vppon certayne condycyons, that they shulde holde theym wythin the boundes to theym lymytted / and ouer that paye yerely a certayne money in waye of trybute.
                     After whyche peace wyth them stablyshed / he repayred cytyes, townes, and castellys, that by the sayde Danys were shatered and broken.
                     And about the .viii. yere of his reygne / kynge Edwarde repayred the wallys and also the cytye of Kaerlyon, that now is called Chester. To the whych were great helpers Etheldredꝰ duke of Mercia, &amp; Elfleda his wyfe, doughter of Alurede as before is shewyd, &amp; suster of this kynge Edwarde. And that done the kynge buylded a stronge castell at Herforde in ye egge of walys. And he enlarged so greatly ye walles of Chester / yt the castell whych before tyme was wyth out the wall, is now wythin.
                     And the .ix. yere of his reygn / Etheldredꝰ duke of Mercia by coūsayll of his wyfe trāslated ye bones of ye holy kyng Oswald, frō Bradony to Gloucestre / &amp; there buylded a fayre monastery in the worshyp of saynt Peter.
                     In the .xii. yere of kyng Edwardes reygne / the Danes repentynge them of theyr couenauntes before made, myndyng &amp; entēdyng ye breche of the same / assēbled an hoste &amp; met with ye kynge in Staffordeshyre, at a place called Toten halle, and soone after at wodenesseylde. At whyche .ii. places

the kynge slew two kynges, two erlys, and many thousandes of the Danys that then occupyed the countrey of Northumberlande.
                     And soon after dyed the noble man Etheldredus duke or erle of Mercia or myddell Englande. After whose deth, the kynge for so myche as he hadde often prouyd her wysedome / he toke the rule of that countrey to hys wyfe Elfleda, London alonely exceptyd, the whyche he toke vnder his onwe rule.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXXX. CHAPITER.
                     OF this noble woman Elfleda, yf I shulde shewe all the vertues, yt shuld aske a long tyme and leasure. But amonges other of her noble dedes / she buylded and newly repayred many townes, cytyes, and castellys / as Tomworth besyde Lychefeld, Stafforde, warwyke, Shrowesbury, watrysbury, Eldysbury, in the forest besyde Chester, that nowe is ouer tourned and destroyed. Also she buylded a cytye wyth a castell in the Northe ende of Mercia vpon yt ryuer Merce, that in those dayes was named Runcofan̄, but now yt is called Runcorn̄. And she also buylded a brydge ouer the ryuer of Seuern̄, whyche is or was named Brymmysburye brydge. This stronge virago fauour of cytezeyns and fere of enymyes / halpe myche the kyng her brother, in gyuynge of counsayll &amp; buyldynge of cytyes. Of her is told that when she hadde ones assayed, the wo and sorowe that women fele and suffer in berynge of a chylde, she hated the enbrasynge of her husband euer / and toke wytnesse of god and sayde, that yt was not cōuenyent or semely to a kinges doughter to vse such flesshely lykynge, wherof suche sorowe shuld ensue or folowe.
                     In the .xiii. yere of the reygne of this Edwarde / a great nauy of Danys, whych in tyme of Alurede were driuen into Fraunce, now retourned agayn and sayled about the west coū
                        trey / and landed in dyuers places, &amp; toke prayes, and went to theyr shyppes agayn. And at one time amōges other they robbed and spoyled at a place called Irchynfeylde, and toke a Brytyshe byshop and caryed hym to theyr shyppes, and fynally raunsomed hym at .xl. pounde. But as soone as kynge Edwarde had knowlege of theyr beyng / he assembled his knyghtes, and sped hym westwarde by lande / and sent a nother hoste by shyppe to encounter the Danys vppon the see. wherof heryng the sayd Danys fledde into Irlande / and by that course voyded the land and handes of the kynge.
                     Then the kynge for strengthynge of the countrey / made a castell at the mouth of the water of Auene, and a nother castell at Bokyngham / and the thyrd faste therby, yt is to meane vpon eyther syde of ye ryuer of Owseone. And after retourned into Northamtonshyre and Bedfordshyre, &amp; faughte there wyth the Danys of these coūtres / and at length subdued the
                           •
                         wyth theyr leder or duke called Turketyllus.
                     About the .xvii. yere of this kynges reygned / Elfleda lady of Mercia before mynded, gaderyd her knightes. And where the Brytons or walshe men brake into the lande about Brekenoke, she wyth her people wythstode theym / and amonge other prysoners &amp; prayes, toke there the quene of walshemen.
                     And the yere folowynge kynge Edwarde buylded or newly reedyfyed the townes of Towsetour and wygmore / and destroyed the castell that the Danys hadde made at Temesforde.

And that yere the noble Elfleda wanne the towne of Derby from the power of the Danys / where they put her in such aduēture, that foure knyghtes, whyche were called Gardeyns of her corps, were slayne faste by her.
                     And ye .xviii. yere of his reygne dyed that noble pryncesse Elfleda in the moneth of Iune / and was buryed in the monastery of saynt Peter, which her lorde and she before tyme hadde buylded wythin the towne of Gloucetour as aboue is touched, ouer the bones of that holy kynge saynte Oswalde / whyche monastery was after throwen to grounde by the Danys. But Aldredus byshop both of yorke &amp; of worcetour, made there an other / whyche is now chefe house or abbay of that towne or cytye.
                     when Elfleda was deed / her doughter named Elswyna helde the lordeshyppe of Mercia a season. But for the kynge cōsydered yt to be to great a thynge for her to rule / he therfore dyscharged her therof, and ioyned it to his kyngedome, but not all wythout stryfe. For dyuers townes kepte of the kyng for a tyme / as Snotyngham or Nothyngam, Tomworth, Derbye, and other / supposynge the doughter wold haue defended them as the mother by her lyfe had done. But finally they came to the kynges subieccyon.
                     Henry archbyshoppe of Huntyngdon, that wrote myche of the cronycles of Englande / in prayse of thys noble woman Elfleda made dyuers dytyes / of the whyche some ben expressyd as foloweth.
                     
                        Cesers tryūphes were not so myche to prayse,
                        As was of Elfleda, that sheldes so ofte dyd rayse
                        Agayne her enymyes this noble ven queresse
                        Uirago and made whose vertue can I not expresse.
                     
                     WHen Edwarde hadde reconciled these foresayde townes / he then buylded a new towne for agayn the olde towne of Nothyngham, on the south syde of the ryuer of Trent / and made a brydge ouer the sayd ryuer betwene the sayd .ii. twones. And as wytnessyth Policronica, the yere folowynge in the sayde towne or cytye of Notyngham, two kinges, that is to saye, of Scotlande and walys yeldyd them vnto kynge Edwarde. The cause why, nor of warre betwene theym to be contynued, is not of hym expressyd.
                     How be yt dyuers bokes of writers of cronycles of Englande, as of Marianꝰ the Scot, wyllam of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntyngdon, &amp; other yt is shewyd that this Edwarde subdued the kynges of Scotlande and of Cūbrys, aboute the .ix. yere of hys reygne. And of the sayde authours yt is also testifyed, that about the .xx. yere of the reygne of the sayde Edwarde, these sayde kynges of Scottes and Cumbrys, shulde chose this kynge Edwarde for theyr chefe lord and patrone, whyche shuld be about this season before expressyd.
                     Then this noble prynce Edwarde, after these thynges set by hym in an order / he in the northe ende of Mercia by the ryuer of Merce, buylded a cytye or towne, and named yt Thylwall, and strengthyd yt wyth knyghtes. And after repayred the cytye of Maynchester / that sore was defaced with warre of ye Danys. After which notable dedis by ye puyssaunt prynce fynyshed / wyth the maryage of hys chylder and many other, whyche I omytte and passe ouer for length of tyme: fynally this noble man dyed, when he hadde reygned wyth great

trauayle by the terme of .xxiiii. yeres at Faryngdon / and from thens conueyed to wynchester, and there enteryd in the monastery of saynt Swythyne / leuyng after hym dyuers sonnes as before is shewed, of the which Ethelstane was eldest.

                        CHarlys surnamed the symple, &amp; sonne of Lewys the .iiii. or Ryen Fayzand / began hys reygne ouer the Frenchemen, in the yere of our lordes incarnacyon, as wytnessyth Iacobꝰ Philippus and other .ix. hundred &amp; .iiii / and the thyrde yere of Edwarde the elder than kynge of Englande. In tyme of whose reygne the Danys, whyche contynuelly ouer the terme of .l. wynters / that is to saye from ye x. yere of Charlys the Ballyd somtyme kynge of Fraunce, vnto ye sayd dayes, had wasted and spoyled the lande, not wythstandyng ye agrementes made bytwene Charlys the emperour and them, as before in ye story of the .iiii. Lewys is shewed: yet they wyth greate hostes aryued in the coū
                        tre of Neustria or Normandy, &amp; robbed and spoyled the countre before them, and slewe the people thereof wythout pytye / and from cytye to cytye kepte on theyr iourney tyll they came vnto the cytye of Roan. wherof the bysshop beynge in greate drede, of subuersyon of the cytye and destruccyon of the crysten people wyth in the same / delyuered the cytye by appoyntment, that he wyth ye people myghte departe thens wythout bodely harme / whyche vnto the sayde Danys was a greate strength, and hurte to the lande of Fraunce.
                     Of thys hoste of Danys was ruler and leder a myscreaunt named Rollo / the whyche was a man of lowe byrthe, but he was of greate strength. The whyche whan he had a season rested hym and hys hoste, &amp; refresshed them wythin the cytye of Roan / he than set forth hys waye, cō
                        maūdyng hys vawnewarde to kepe theyr iourney towarde Parys. And for ye more spede to be made / he shypped hys Danis ryght there / and one parte he sent by the ryuer of Sean, the seconde by the ryuer of Lyger or Leyr, and the thyrde by the water Geronde.
                     Than the Danys that passyd by the ryuer of Leyr came at length to the cyte of Nauntes / and wan that cytye by strength, and slewe therin moche people. And the byshop of the same named Guymerte beynge at masse, they slewe at the aulter. And whan they had spoyled that cytye &amp; the countre there about / than yode they to the cytye of Angiers, &amp; brent and robbyd it most cruelly. And that done they yode vnto Towres, and layde syege to that cytye. The which by the presens of the holy body of saynt Martyne, whych at that tyme was wythin ye cytye / it was a whyle preserued. But soone after the munkes feryng the sworde of the Danys fled the cytye secretly, and toke the body wyth them. And soone after the Danes had the towne at theyr wyll / and brent the abbay before the town or stādynge without the towne / and spoyled and robbed the cytye &amp; townes thorough the countre of Guyan.
                     whan the Danys had thus subdued the more parte of Neustria or Normandy. They wyth theyr duke Rollo by ye ryuer of Seyn̄ drewe towarde Parys. And fyrst entred the landes of Burgoyne and Auerne &amp; in effecte to Senons. wherof heryng

the monkes of the monastery of Flory, where the body of saynte Benet than rested, they toke that holy treasoure and bare it vnto Orlyaunce / &amp; layde it in the chyrche of saynt Anyan, tyll the persecucyon were ouer passed.
                     Of thys monastery was at that dayes lyuynge a defensour by promyse before made, whose name in latyne is called Sigillosus, &amp; in Frēch Sigillophes an erle / whych was taken for patrone of the same abbaye. To whom in the nyght folowynge that the monkes were fled, as before is sayd / saynt Benet appered, &amp; blamed hym yt he none other wyse had defended ye place of hys Sepulture. wyth whych visyon the sayd erle beynge feryd / gaderyd vnto hym vpon the daye folowyng such small power as he than myghte make, &amp; set vpon the Danys and draue them backe, &amp; slewe of them a great nomber. And ye prayes that he there wan, he offered to god and saynte Benet / by whose prayers he knewe well that he opteyned that vyctory.
                     In tyme yt the Danys thus persecuted the countre of Fraunce, and the kynge was not of power them to resyst / for so mych as Charles knew well that the bysshop of Roan named Franke, was in good fauour of Rollo: he therfore sent hym in ambassade to the sayd Rollo, to requyre a trewe or trewse for thre monethes / the whych was graūted. The which trewse ended, the sayd Rollo beseged the cytye of Chartrys. Duryng whiche syege / the duke of Burgoyne named Richarde wyth hys retynue assayled the Danys. In tyme of which fyght Ebalde erle of Poytowe was present, and draue backe ye Danys. wherwyth the bysshop of the cytye beynge encoraged / toke wyth hym ye smocke of our lady, whyche at those dayes was kepte there wyth greate reuerence / and wyth the cytesyns &amp; other issued out of the cytye, &amp; made vpon the Danys a great scomfyture So that by the prowesse of the foresayde two temporall lordes, and assystens of this spyrituall man / Rollo was compelled to fle and forsake his siege, &amp; not without huge slaughter.
                     Rollo then hauynge greate dysdayne and dyspleasure of thys ouerthrowe and scumfyture of hys Danys / reassembled them that were abrode scatered, and cōmaunded thē to ouer ryde the countre, and to destroye it in all that they myght. After whych cōmaundement thus to them gyuen / this cruell people slewe man, women, &amp; chylde, that were not apte to do to them seruyce / and brent the chyrches and temples, and rauyshed virgyns as well religious as other / So that miserable it was to beholde the greate abhomynacyon of these tyrannous Danys, that brent, robbed; and slewe that innocent people wythout mercy.
                     The lordes and comons thus beset with cruell fury of theyr enmyes, assembled them by sondry cōpanyes and went vnto the kynge / shewynge vnto hym theyr mysery, and blamed as they durste hys ferefulnesse and negligence, that he nor none for hym otherwyse wythstode the crueltye of the Danys / that hadde destroyed a greate parte of hys lande.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXXXII. CHAPITER.
                     CHarlys herynge this exclamacyon of hys subgettes, and cō
                        syderyng hys lacke of power to withstande that malyce of hys enemyes, was ryght pensyfe and heuy in hys herte / and castynge in hys mynde many sondry wayes, he lastly determyned to sende agayne the aboue

named Frank byshop of Roan vnto Rollo prynce of Danys / shewynge hym that yf he wolde renye hys pagan lawe and become a crysten man, he wolde to hym gyue in maryage Gylda his doughter, wyth the hole countre of Neustria for her dowar.
                     whan Rollo had receyued this tydynges from the kyng by the mouth of his frende Frank / he somwhat attempred hys fury and crueltye, and condescended to a trewe, by the counsayle of hys lordes for ye terme of .iii. monethes / in the whyche tyme he myghte haue some cōmunycacyon wyth the kynge, for ferther processe of thys mater. So that after it was concluded by the counsayle of bothe prynces / that theyr metynge shulde be vpon ye ryuer or flode named Ept. where shortly after the sayd prynces had cōmunycacyon the one wyth the other / theyr people standynge vpon eyther syde of the sayd ryuer. where it was concluded, that Rollo shulde forsake hys pagan lawe, and take vppon hym the lyuerey of Crystes baptym / and after to marye the forenamed Gylda, and to receyue wyth her as is aboue shewed. whyche conclusyon thus taken eyther fro other departed / and shortly after at the cytye of Roan, all the foresayd couenaūtes were executed and fulfylled. And whan the sayd Rollo was crystened / his name was chaunged and called Robert, after the erle of Poytowe / whyche receyued hym at the fonte stone.
                     Of thys Rollo or Robert, dyscended lynyally duke wyllyam of Normandy, whych conquered England / as after shalbe more clerely shewed.
                     Than this Robert thus crystened, was seased of the coūtre of Neustria / whom the kynge created duke, and named hym duke of Neustria.
                     But it was not longe after, yt this name of Neustria was chaunged &amp; called Normandye / after the name of Normayns, or men commyng out of the North / or of Nor, that is to meane North, and men, whyche two syllables togyder make Norman, or a man of the North.
                     whyche Normans or Danys after the exposycyon of mayster Gagwyne / shulde be descended of the nacyon called the Gothes. whyche Gothes of the cytye or men of Sithica ben descended. The whyche Gothys in the dayes of the grete Cōstantine / for theyr feersnesse and cruelty, were dryuen from theyr countre then by them inhabyted nere vnto the ryuer called Thamys, in ye North partyes of Europe / and nowe ben inhabyted in Dacia, whych in our speche is called Dēmarke. And where some men holde an opynyon, that Danys and Saxons shulde be one maner of people / it may congruly folowe. For Saxons ben of the coūtre of Germany / and contayne the lande after the sayenge of Strabo, in the west parte of Germania. From the flode called Uistergus or wysera, vnto the famous ryuer called the Ryne. And Dacia or Denmarke is in the North partyes.
                     Than to retorne to thys Rollo or Robert / the story sayth yt he became a good crysten man. In token wherof as affermeth the French boke / he gaue vnto dyuers chyrches and monasteryes of Fraunce greate gyftes, as well of possessions as of mouable goodes / &amp; contynued hys pease with the kyng as he before had promised.
                     After whyche pease thus stablysshed bytwene the kynge and the Danys / Robert brother vnto Eudo last kyng of Fraūce, contrary hys trouth and allegyaunce, seased certayne cytyes and other holdes of the kynges enherytaunce. wherfore the kynge seynge that he coude not refourme

hym of that errour, by no meanes of entreaty or other lyke wayes / assembled an hoste and met wyth hym in playne batayle / in the whych ye sayde Robert was slayne. Thys Robert hadde a suster, whyche was maryed vnto Hebert erle of Uermendoys / whyche erle herynge of the deth of his brother in lawe, by enticement of hys wyfe, as the story demeth, mette the kynge at the retorne of the felde / and requyred hym in moste humble wyse, that he wolde vouchesafe to lodge wyth hym in hys manour called the castell of Perone.
                     The kynge castynge no parell, thanked hym of hys kynde request, and graūted to go wyth hym / where he was receyued and fested wyth all honoure. But whan thys erle hadde conueyed the kynges frendes and strength from hym / he thā kepte him there as a prisoner or murdred hym / so that he neuer came at large after. whyche tydynges certaynly knowē / Algina wyfe vnto the sayd Charlys the symple mystrustynge the Frenchmen / wyth fewe accōpanyed toke secrete shyppyng / and wyth her yonge sonne named Lewys sayled into Englande, there to be comforted of her fader Edwarde surnamed the elder. And thus ended the reygne of thys Charlys the symple / whan he hadde reygned after the sayeng of Uynsent hystoryall and other, by the terme of xvi. yere full / leuynge after hym the foresayde chylde named Lewys.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXXXIII. CHAPITER.
                     RAdulphus the sonne of Rycharde duke of Burgoyne / began his reygne ouer the Frēchmen, in the yere of our lorde .ix. hundred &amp; xxii / and the .xxi. yere of Edwarde ye elder than kynge of Englande.
                     Here is to be noted that for so mych as Algina wyfe vnto Charlys the symple, was thus secretly voyded ye lande of Fraunce wyth her sonne Lewys / and that the lande myghte not be wyth out a ruler / the lordes assembled at Parys, and there toke theyr counsayle for the admyssyon of an hed or kyng of the lande. which lordes after longe debatynge of this mater, fynally agreed that thys abouer
                           •
                        amed Radulphus or Rauf. son of the duke of Burgoyne, as aboue is sayd / as nexte heyre to the crowne shulde be admytted for kynge, and so was admytted. Of the whyche lytell of hys dedes are put in memory / except that in the tyme of hys reygne the Sarasyns entred the lande of Burgoyne wyth a grete armye, and dyd mych harme in that duchy. wherfore the kynge gaderynge his hoste, met wyth them at a place called in latyne Carrolas, and in French Callo the lasse / where the Frenchmen were vyctours, but nat wythout greate losse of theyr people.
                     Than it foloweth, whanne thys Rauff. had ruled the lande of Fraūce by ye space of .xii. yeres / he dyed with out issue male. And was buryed in the chyrche of saynte Calumb in the prouynce of Senys.
                  
                  
                     Anglia. THE .CLXXXIIII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        EThelstan̄ ye son of Edwarde the elder, began hys reygne ouer the more part of Englande, in ye yere of our lorde .ix. hundred &amp; .xxv / and the thyrde yere of Rauff. than kynge of Fraunce.
                     In the fyrst yere of the reygne of Ethelstan̄ / the holy chyld Dunstane was borne in the coūtre of Glastenbury,

whose lyfe shone after wyth many myracles.
                     This was somtyme abbot of Glastē
                        bury / &amp; lastly archbyshop of Caunterbury. whose holynes &amp; ꝓphecyes are shewed at length, in the .vi. chapyter of the .xvi. tytle of the worke called Sin̄ Antonini, and in the legende of the chyrche also.
                     In the seconde yere of the reygne of Ethelstane / for an vnytye and a peace to be hadde betwene the kyng and the Danis of Northumberland, he maryed to Sithyricꝰ theyr kyng his suster. But after .v. yeres this Sithyricus dyed. After whose deth he seasyd the countrey into hys owne hande / and put oute the sonne of the foresayd Sythyricus. And when he hadde thus accorded wyth the Danys of Northumberlande / he shortly after made subiect to him Cōstantyn kynge of Scottes. But the sayd Cō
                        stantyne meked hym so lowely to the kynge / that he restoryd hym to hys former dygnytye. wherfore the sayd Constantyne sayde in prayse of the kynge / that yt was more honour to make a kynge, then to be a kynge. whyche acte was done by the affyrmaunce of Polycronycon, in the yere of grace .ix. hundred &amp; .xxvi / which then after that saynge shuld be the seconde yere of the reygn of this Ethelstane. It is testyfyed of Policronica, that thys Ethelstane shuld marye one of his susters named Editha or Edyth, vnto Otto the fyrst of that name emperour of Almayne, and receyued from hym many precyous iewellys and relyques. But of this speketh nothyng the cronicle of Romaynes. Howe be yt yt is shewyd there, that the foresayd Ottho or Otto had a wyfe named Alunda / whych as before is sayde in the storye of Edward the elder, myght be the doughter of the sayd Edward and of Edgina his seconde wyfe. But Uincentius historialis sayth / that Henry duke of Saxony, whyche was father vnto the fyrste Otto / sent vnto Ethelstane, requyrynge of hym hys suster to mary vnto his sonne Otto. By whych reason I maye folowe, that this Ottho maryed the suster of Ethelstane, but not Edythe.
                     Of these foresayde iewelles sent by Otto / one was a precyouse vessell of stone called Onechynus / whych was of suche clerenesse, &amp; also so subtily &amp; craftely wrought, that yt apperyd to mannes syght as grene corne hadde growen wythin yt, and moued and waued as corne doth standyng in the felde. More ouer in yt apperyd vynes burgenyng and berynge fruyte / and men also to syght mouynge and styrynge. He also receyued the great Constantynes sworde / wherin was grauen wyth great letters of golde, the name of the owner. And the hyltes therof were coueryd wyth great plates of golde. And one of the nayles was fastenyd to the crosse of the sayd sworde, that Criste suffred with his passyon. But in thys reporte or saynge, Polycronycon varyeth from his former sayng / were he reporteth two of the sayd nayles to be spent vppon the brydell of the sayde Constantyne, and the thyrde nayle to be caste into a daūgerous swalowe of the see, as before is rehersed in the .lxix. chapiter of thys worke. He also receyued the spere of Charlys the gret, whych after the opynyon of some wryters, was the spere that Longeus opened wyth Crystes syde. And the baner of saynte Morys, a relyque of greate pryce / wyth a part of the holy crosse, and a parte of the crown of thorne of our sauyoure.
                     Of the whych iewellys kyng Ethelstane gaue a parte vnto saynte Swithunys of wynchester / and some he

gaue vnto ye abbay of Malmesbury.
                     I haue sene a cronycle of Englād, which testyfyeth, that this Ethilstan̄ was ye fyrst kynge that euer was enoynted in this land. All be yt I fynd therof lytell authorytye / excepte that Guydo and other testyfyen, that he was crowned at the kynges towne nowe called Kyngestone, x. myles from London, of Athelyne their archbyshoppe of Caunterbury. But that proueth not or argueth hym to be the fyrste for that reason. For ryghte so was his fader Edwarde crowned of Plemounde archbyshoppe of the sayde see. But Guydo aforesayd affyrmeth that Alurede graund fader to thys Ethylstane / was enoyntyd kyng by authoryte of Leo ye .v. then pope. wherfore it agreeth better that he shulde be the fyrste.
                     Then yt foloweth in the story, that aboute the .viii. yere of the reygne of thys Ethilstane, dyed Frystane byshoppe of wynchester / and Brystane was byshoppe after hym. Of whom yt is radde, that he sange euery daye masse for all Crysten soules. And as the byshoppe Brystane went vppon a nyght about a chirch yerde, and sayde hys deuocyons for all crysten soules, and lastly sayde, requiescant in pace / he harde a voyce as yt hadde ben a great hoste of people saynge. Amen.
                     Soone after Constantyne kynge of Scottes, brake couenaunt wyth kynge Ethylstane. wherfore he assembled his knyghtes and made towarde Scotlande. And in hys way he tourned to saynte Iohn̄ of Beuerley and offeryd there hys knyfe vppon the aulter / sayenge that yf he retourned wyth vyctorye, he shulde redeme hys knyfe wyth a noble pryce / and that done proceded vppon hys iourney, and in cōclusyon scomfyted the Scottes, and broughte theym agayne vnto dewe subieccyon. And after accordynge to the promyse before made / he retourned to yorke, and so to the chyrche where the corps of saynt Iohn̄ of Beuerley laye / redemynge his knyfe worthely as he before hadde promysed.
                     In the .vi. chapyter of the .vi. boke of Polycronycon / yt is remembred that kynge Ethilstane after this subduynge of the Scottes, beyng wyth hys lordes and famylyers nere vnto the castell of Dunbar / prayed to god and saynte Iohn̄ yf Beuerley, that in that countrey he myght leue some remembraunce or token, that those that then were lyuynge, and also suche as shulde come after, myghte knowe that the Scottes by ryghte shulde be subiectes to Englyshmen. And soone after wyth hys sworde he smote vppon a great stone standyng nere vnto the sayd castell / with whyche stroke the stone was ryuen to an elle in length, that in the tyme of Edwarde the thyrde was there remaynyng to be sene. And whyther at this daye yt is so / that I am in doute.
                     ye haue harde before, that kynge Ethilstane after the deth of Sythericus kynge of Northumberlande / seasyd that lande or prouynce into hys owne handes, and putte out his sonne. whyche after allyed hym with Constantyne kynge of Scottes, and maryed his doughter. By whose styrynge and exhortacyon, he gatheryd a company of Danys, Scottes, and other / and entred the mouth of Humber wyth a stronge nauy.
                     wherof herynge Ethilstane, in all goodly haste prepared hys armye / and at length met wyth hym and his people at a place called Brymforde, where he hadde a great and solemne vyctorye. For as yt is shewyd in the foresayde chapyter and boke / after the kynge by helpe of god and saynt

Adelyne hadde defended the subtyll assaute made vppon hym by nyghte of his enymyes / he vppon the morne by helpe of hys brother Edmunde &amp; Dodo the archbyshoppe, chased his sayde enymyes, and slew there Constantyne kynge of Scottes, and .v. small or vnder kynges, and .xii. dukes, wyth the more partye of all the straūge nacyons at ye tyme there gaderyd. whyche batayll shuld be done by the meanyng of the sayd Policronicon, about ye last yere of his reygn.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXXXV. CHAPITER.
                     IT is also testyfyed of dyuers wryters, that Ethylstane after this vyctory thus obteyned of the Danys and Scottes, or Scottes &amp; Danys / he also subdued the Northe Brytons that dwelled at Herforde &amp; there about / and compelled theym to pay to hym yerely for a tribute .iii. hū
                        dred pounde of syluer, xxv. hundred hede of nete, and .xx. pounde in gold. But Guydo sayth that kynge Ethilstane caused to come before hym at Herforde cytye the rulers of all the North Brytayne / &amp; there had wyth them suche communycacyon / that he forced them to graunte vnto hym as a yerely trybute .xx. pounde of gold. iii. hundred poūde in syluer, &amp; of heddes of nete .xxv. hundred / wyth dogges &amp; haukes to a certayne nomber. After whych vyctories he went vnto Exeter, and repayred yt &amp; the wallys therof suffycyently.
                     Dane Iohn̄ Lydgate a munke somtyme of saynt Edmundes bury, made a goodly treatyse of this kyng Ethilstane / shewynge that he was in so great persecucyon of the Danys, yt he was constrayned to call at wynchester a great counsayll of his lordes. where after longe debatyng of the mater, &amp; dyuers ambassades and messages sent about by ye kyng &amp; the Danys / It was fastly cōcluded that the kynge shuld puruey hym a champyon to fyghte wyth Colibronde or Colbronde a geaunt &amp; Dane, which the Danys had appoynted for theyr cheuetayne. wherfore the kyng enserchyng thorough his landes for such a knyght, &amp; myght none fynde / was in great daunger &amp; dystresse &amp; heuynesse. And for so mych as he well perceuyd ye mannes power fayled / he by the aduyse of lordes spyrituall &amp; temporall fyll to fastynge &amp; prayer, and cōtynued therin by a certayn of time, wyth perfyte &amp; charitable deuocyon.
                     In tyme of whyche sayde abstynence / a vysyon was shewed vnto Ethilstane, cōfortyng hym, &amp; also cō
                        maundyng hym, yt erely vppon the next mornynge he shuld stand at the North gate of the citye of winchester and there he shuld fynde amonges ye porayll / a pylgryme clad in palmers wede, whome he shulde chose for his champyon. After whyche vysyon thus to hym shewyd, he dyd accordyngly / and founde a man of goodly stature, and somdeale stryken in age, and clade as he was monyshed by the vysyon. wherof he fyrste gaue vnto god thankynges / and after made request to this pylgryme, that he wold take vpon hym thys batayll for the defence of the lande / whyche layde for hym many reasonable excuses, as well for his age as otherwise. How be it finally he graūted ye kyng to fullfyll his request and cōmaundement. And at the daye before lymytted and assygned met in the feld with the forenamed geaunt called Colbronde, wythoute the gate of ye cytye in a medow or pasture called Hydemede / where betwene them two was faughten a longe and cruell fyghte, so that the kynge was in great fere of hys champyon. But fynally by

helpe of god the pylgryme wanne the honoure of that fyghte / and slew that geaunt that was of excedynge stature, and therunto of great and passynge strength. whyche vyctorye by the pylgryme thus by grace obteyned / the kynge wyth his barony fette hym into the citye of wynchester wyth solemne processyon, and cō
                        ueyed hym vnto the cathedral chirch of the same / where he thanked god wyth great deuocyon, &amp; offryd there the axe, wyth the whych he had slayn the Danys champyon. After whych oblacyon with dew reuerence &amp; other obseruances by hym and other fynyshed / the kynge caused hym to be conueyed vnto hys courte, where he taryed that nyght wyth myche daunger. And vppon the morne erely he made suche meanes / that he wolde nedely departe, and yt in the same apparell yt he came thyther. when the kynge was aduertysed that his pylgryme wold so hastly departe / whom he entendyd to haue holden wyth hym in his courte, and to haue endowed with ryche possessyons: he cō
                        maunded hym to be broughte vnto hys presence. And when he sawe he coude not cause him to tary, he required hym to shewe his name / wherof also he besought the kyng to pardon hym. wherfore the kyng cōsyderyng hys hasty departynge, wyth many other thynges in hym to be consydered / was the more desyrous to haue of hym some knowlege. And for that he was effectuose in his desyre, when the pylgryme perceyuyd that he coude not wyth the kynges pleasure departe wythoute dysclosynge of hys name / he sayde he myght not dyscouer hys name wythin the walles of the cytye, wythoute the offence of hys conscyence.
                     wherfore the kyng graunted to go wyth hym tyll he were in the brode feldes. Uppon whyche graunt thus made / the kynge commaunded dyuers great gyftes to be to hym presented, whyche all he vtterly refused. Shortely to cōclude / the kyng wyth a certayne of his lordes conueyed this sayd pylgryme vnto the townes ende. And when he was thyther cō
                        men / he there requyred of the performaunce of the promyse. where thys pylgryme syttynge one his kne / besoughte the kynge of his especyall grace, that he wolde put a parte his lordes and other, so that he myghte shewe vnto hym his name onely.
                     whyche done / he in moste humble wyse besoughte hym, that he wolde kepe hys name secrete for the space of .xxiiii. oures. where of by ye kyng affyrmaunce to hym fyrmely made / he shewed vnto hym, that he was hys naturall lyege man and subiect, and that his name was Guy of warwike. Of whyche tydynges the kyng was very ioyous, and offeryd hym then of newe many ryche rewardes and gyftes. But all was in vayne, for he wolde nothynge receyue / so that the kynge and he lastely departed wyth wepynge eyen. And after as affyrmeth my sayde authoure / not farre from warwyke in a wyldernesse, he purchased by goddes purueyaunce a lodgynge in a heremytage / where by the terme of two yeres and more he dwelled &amp; kept an harde lyfe.
                     And herynge that dame Felyce his owne wyfe fed dayly .xiii. poore men for Cristes sake / he went thyther sondry tymes and fette there his aimes / hys sayde wyfe then lyenge at the castell of warwyke, not knowynge of any man what he was / tyll lastely he was visited with so sore sykenes, that he knew well that he shuld dye. wherefore he sente hys weddynge rynge vnto hys wyfe / requyrynge her in all haste to come and speke

wyth hym. whych she obeyed in humble wyse / and sped her vnto the sayd Heremytage wyth all womanly dylygence, and fande hym deed at her commynge / whom she besprent with many a salt tere. And as she was enfourmed of the messenger as he dyed she buryed hym ryghte there. And more ouer as saith my sayd authour he monyshed her by the sayd messenger, that she shulde prouyde for her selfe / for she shuld also alter her mortall lyfe the .xv. day folowyng. which also she obeyed, and made suche prouisyon, that she was in that place buryed by hym. All whyche mater the sayde Dane Iohn̄ Lydgate affyrmeth, that he toke out of the boke of Gerarde Cambres̄ / whyche wrote mych of the dedes and storyes of the prynces of Englande, as Policronica and other authour testyfyen / and as the sayde Lydgate in the ende of his sayde treatyse wytnessyth, as by the mater folowynge appereth.
                     For more authorite, as of this mater This translacyon, such as in sentēce Out of laten made by the cronycler Called of old Gerardus Cambrēce / whyche wrote the dedes, wyth great dylygence.
                     
                        Of them that were in weste Saxon crowned kynges,
                        Greatly cōmendyd for theyr knyghtly excellence
                        Guy of warwyke, in hys famouse wrytynges.
                     
                     AL whyche sayde treatyse is shewyd at length in meter of viii. stauys, after the maner of the precedentes, by the dylygent labour of the sayde Dane Iohn̄ Lydgate. The whyche I haue here sette in / for so mych as yt concernyth mater that was done in the tyme of the reygne of thys Ethylstane. The whyche after the accorde of moste wryters▪ broughte thys lande agayne to one monarchye / and reygned as kynge therof by the full terme of .xvi. yeres / and was buryed at the monastery of Malmysbury, leuynge after hym no chylde. wherfore the rule of the land fyll vnto Edmunde his brother.
                  
                  
                     Francia. THE .CLXXXVI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        LEwys the sonne of Charlis ye symple / beganne hys reygne ouer the Frenchmen, in ye yere of our lorde ix. hundred and xxxiiii / and the .ix yere of Ethelstane then kynge of Englande. ye haue harde before in the ende of the storye of Charlys ye symple, how Elgina the quene wyth Lewys her yonger sonne, was fledde into England to her father Edward the elder. wherfore ye lordes of Fraū
                        ce not knowynge where she with the Chylde was gone / chose the forenamed Rauf. for theyr kynge. After whose deth the said lordes of Fraūce beynge ascertayned of the beynge of the sayd Lewys in England / sent vnto hym the archbyshop of Senys, &amp; Hughe surnamed le graunde / desyrynge hym to restore into Fraunce, and take therof possessyon.
                     Then Elgina herynge the message of the lordes, and trustyng vnto thē / by counsayll of her frendes made her redy wyth her son, &amp; sayled shortly after into Fraunce. where she was receyued wyth myche honour / &amp; shortly after crowned her sonne Lewys kynge / at the cytye of Laon̄.
                     This Lewys is named ye .v. Lewys. In the thyrde yere of whose reygne fyll a scarcytye of corne &amp; vytayll / by

reason wherof ensued a great famyn in so myche that people voyded the realme, &amp; many dyed for defaut. For as wytnesseth the frenche cronycle / a quarter of whete was then worth .xx. poūde. of ye money / which is of value after sterlynge money .l.s. or there about. This kyng beryng in mynd the murder and treason done agayn his father by Hebert, as before in the storye of Charlis the symple is declared / cast and ymagined in his mynde how he myght wythout shedynge of blood, reuenge the deth of his fader / and after many ymagynacyons and thought is reuolued in his mynde, he lastely dyuysed a letter / the whych he charged a seruaunt of his to brynge to hys presence when he was sette amonge his lordes in counsayll. when kynge Lewys hadde compassed this in hys mynde / he for nedes of hys realme called a great coūsayll of his barony at Laon̄ / whyther amonges the other, the sayde Heberte erle of Uermendoys was warned to come. And when the kynge was ascertayned of theyr commynges / he apoynted a secrete cōpanye in harnes to be in a secrete chamber, nere vnto the place of the sayde counsayll / and at conuenient tyme after yode vnto the same, and all his lordes wyth hym. And when he hadde a season commoned wyth hys lordes of suche maters as hym lyked / sodeynly came one to hym and sayd that a man was cōmen wyth a letter dyrected to hys grace oute of Englande / the whych he commaunded to be broughte vnto hys syghte.
                     when the kyng hadde vnfolde the letter, and radde a parte therof, he smyled. whereof the lordes beynge ware purposed the kynge to haue receyued some iewyllys or ioyous nouellys oute of Englande.
                     whyle the kynge was aboute to delyuer this letter to his scribe or secretory / one of hys lordes sayde vnto hym. Syr we truste ye haue some iocande &amp; mery tydynges oute of Englāde, that ye haue cause of smilyng. I shall shewe the cause to you sayde the kyng. There is dwellyngin England a kynnesman of myne named Harman / the whych is a man of gret myghte, and myne especyall frende. He shewyth me by this letter, that an husbandeman or a vyleyne badde or requyred hys lorde vnto his howse to dyner / and vnder the coloure therof he slewe hys sayde lorde. And for the sayde Harman thynketh the law of that lande to fauourable for such an haynous dede / hetherfore writeth to me to haue myne aduyse in thys mater. wherfore sens ye be all present / I praye you shewe to me your opynyons in this mater. whych with one voyce sayde yt the murderer was worthy to suffer the moste shamefull and cruell deth, &amp; to be hanged and strangled in a rope. But for ye kynge wolde be certaynely enfourmed of the consentes of theym all / he began at the hygest, and so pursued theym tyll he came to Hebert erle of Uermē
                        doys / the whych alowed the sentēce as the other hadde done.
                     Then the kynge made a token to ye walshemen betwene hym &amp; them before appoynted / so ye anon they were present. &amp; sette sure hold vppon the sayde Hebert. To whom the kynge sayd, Hebert thou art the husbondman or vilayne yt I haue spoken of / whych slew his lord vnder colour of byddynge or gestynge hym in hys house. For traytoursly thou dydeste requyre my lorde and father vnder thyne house or castell of Peron̄ / and there not remembrynge the kyndnes to the by hym before dayes shewyd, nor thyne allegyauntes and trouthe that toward hym thou shuldest haue

borne / kept hym lyke a prysoner and lastely murderyd hym, to the greate daunger agayne god, &amp; to the world shame. wherfore accordynge to thy desert, and after thyne own sentence and iudgemēt / take now thy reward and guardon.
                     After whyche sentence thus gyuen by the kynge / the sayde Hebert was by the executers ladde vnto an hylle wythout the citye of Laon̄ / and there most shamefully hanged. whych hyll for that cause was named Hebertes hyll longe tyme after.
                     About thys tyme the seconde duke of Normandy named wyllyam longa Spata, ye son of Rollo or Robert fyrste duke of Normandy / was slayne by treason of one Arnolde erle of Flaūdres / for encheson that the sayd wyllyam ayded a noble man of Pycardy named Herloyn̄, agayne the sayde Arnolde.
                     This wyllyam left after hym a son named Richarde / whych at the tyme of his fathers deth was not of suffycient age to rule so gret a dukedome. wherfore Lewys kynge of Fraunce desyrous of that prouynce, whyche of late dayes belonged to his antecessours and progenitours / sought besyly the wayes and meanes, to haue this chylde Rycharde vnder his tuycyon &amp; gydynge. And this to brynge to effecte spedde hym vnto Roan̄ / callynge there before hym the lordes and rulers of the countrey / hauynge vnto them many plesaunt and fayre wordes, in promysyng to them ayde and assystence to reuenge the deth of theyr lorde and duke / and in the conclusyon desyred of them yt he myght haue the noryshynge and bryngyng vp of the chylde, tyll he came to hys lawfull age.
                     whyche thynge thus by the kynge desyred / the lordes anon coniectured in theyr myndes, yt he desyred the kepyng of theyr yonge lord, to ye ende yt he myghte ye more easely obteyne the possession of that dukedome. For the whych, the lordes and other of the cytye were in great rumour and grudge agayne the kynge. wherof he beynge monyshed, to appeace the multytude / the kynge toke the chylde in his armes, and so bare hym into the place of the assemble of the people / &amp; there shewyd vnto theym wyth affyrmaunce of great othes, that hys entent was onely for ye wele of the child and for defence of hys countrey, and not to clayme any ryghte or tytle of the duchy / excepte onely the homage therof, whyche belongeth to hym by iuste tytle.
                     By meane of whyche fayre speche, the kynge obteyned his purpose, and caried the chyld with hym into Fraū
                        ce, not forgetynge the vnkynde dealynge of the Normans.
                     when Arnolde erle of Flaūdres vnderstode that to the kynge of Fraūce the guydynge of ye yonge chyld was commytted, ferynge yt he wyth power of the Normans wolde ronne vppon hym reuengynge of the chyldes fathers deth / sent vnto the kyng x. pounde weyghte of golde, wherof euery pounde cōteyneth .xii. ounces, and euery oūce in value of fyne gold xl.s / so that after this rate his presente shulde be in value to ye summe of .ii. hundred &amp; .xl. pounde. All be yt mayster Gagwyne sayth he sent vnto hym but .xl. marke / besechyng him to be his good and gracyous lorde, and not to gyue to hasty credence to hys accusours. For he in suche wyse wolde declare hym selfe, and delyuer vnto the kynge the murderers of duke wyllyam / he meane wherof he shulde certaynly know, that he was innocēte of the sayd dukes deth. And ouer this he made a frende about the kynge, whyche spake good wordes

for hym, &amp; put in the kynges mynde the great hurtes &amp; iniuryes that he and his progenytours hadde susteyned of the Danys or Normans. By meane whereof this murdour was forgoten / &amp; more and more the kyng malygned agayne the Normans / and to the chylde he bare not so good mynde as some men thoughte that he wolde do.
                     Uppon a daye when the kyng was retourned from hys dysporte of huntynge / a lyght cōplaynt was brouht to hym of the chylde Rycharde, of an offence that he had commytted. For the which he rebuked him otherwyse then was syttyng to his honour, and called hym opprobryously, and thretened hym greuously / and after that caused hym to be kept more straytly, then he before hadde vsed to be.
                     To this chylde Rycharde was assygned a mayster or teacher named Osmunde / whyche Osmunde hadde a famylyer named Iuon̄. These two apperceyuynge the kynges indygnacyon that he bare towarde the chyld / studyed for his enlargynge, and lastly coūsaylyd hym that he shuld fayne hym self syke. The whych was done, in suche wyse that all suche as awayted vppon hym, supposed hym to be very syke, by reason wherof his kepers toke the lesse cure of hym.
                     wherof Osmunde beynge ware, and also beynge sure of the kynge / made a great trusse of herbes or grasse, wherin he wrapped the chyld, and so conueyed hym oute of the cytye of Laon̄ / and there receyued hym an horse redy for the iourney / &amp; so sped hym vnto Cosuy, and delyueryd the chylde to the captayne of that town. And from thēs he rode all nyght tyll he came vnto Senlys / &amp; there shewed all hys doynge vnto ye erle of that coūtrey named Bernard, which was nere kynnesman vnto ye yonge duke.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXXXVII. CHAPITER.
                     BErnarde hauynge knowlege of the escape of his kynnesmā Rycharde / sente in all haste vnto Hugh le graunde erle of Parys, for to haue his ayde and assystence. The whych without taryeng assēbled his knyghtes, and conueyed the chylde from Cousy to Senlys or Saynlys to his neuewe Bernarde / where he was receyued wyth mych ioye and honoure.
                     when Lewys was ascertayned of the scape of Rycharde, and howe he was in the guydynge of Hughe the great or graunde / anon he sent vnto hym, gyuynge hym in commaundement that he shulde restore the chyld to hym. The whyche excused hym, and sayde that the chylde was in the kepynge of erle Bernarde and not in hys.
                     The kynge seynge how he was deluded / sente for Arnolde or Arnulfe erle of Flaundres / whyche at his cō
                        maundement counsayled the kynge to wynne Hugh le graūde with riche behestes or gyftes. After whose counsayll worchynge / kynge Lewys wylled the sayd Hugh to mete with hym at the crosse of Compeyn̄, where the sayd Hugh shortly after met with the kynge. To whome the kynge promysed great parte of the duchy of Normandy / wyth that that he wolde refuse the partye of the Normans, and take his parte agayne them. By meane of which promises this erle Hugh was ouercomē / and agreed with the kynge to warre vppon one parte of the countrey, whyle he warred vpon that other. And forthwyth receyuyd an armye of the kynge, and spedde hym to Bayon̄, &amp; made cruell warre vppon that countrey. And kynge Lewys entryd vppon the prouynce of Caux / and wasted and spoyled that

Coste in all that he myghte.
                     whan Barnarde the Dane, and also Barnarde erle of Senlys, conceyued ye vntrouth of Hugh le graūt, and also the greate hostes that they were beset wyth / by theyr counsayles and other they sent vnto the kynge certayne messengers, gyuynge them in commaundement to saye, that in vayne the kynge hadde entred that countre with his armye / for the citye of Roan and all the prouince was at hys commaundement. Besechynge hym not to waste nor spoyle the coū
                        tre but to ayde and helpe defende it agayne theyr enemyes.
                     Of thys message the kynge was ryght fayne / and forthwith sped him tyll he came to Roan, wher he was accordynge to hys honour receyued. For the whyche cause he sent in all hast vnto Arnulfe erle of Flaūders / monassynge hym that he sease of his warres in Bayon, tyll he receyued farther knowlege.
                     The kyng thus restyng in Roan, deuysed hys maters at hys pleasure / so that the Normayns obeyed them to all hys requestes. And for ye good aberynge that Barnarde the Dane was of agayne the kynge / he graunted to hym the gydynge of the yonge duke. And whan he shulde departe / he ordeyned as hys deputye one named Raoull or Rauf. The whyche after the kynges departure, behaued hym so cruelly to the Normans / that they were very irke of hym. And ouer thys the foresayd Barnard ferynge the kynges retorne, and other more greuous punysshement than they before hadde susteyned / sent his messengers vnto Grolle kynge of Denmarke than beynge at Chyerbourk / wyllyng hym to assemble his people / and to make of them two hostes. wherof to sende ye one by lande, and that other by water / &amp; so to entre the coūtre of Normandy in wastyng and spoylynge it / by reason wherof he myghte brynge the kynge to some cōmunycacyon. whych all was done as the sayd Barnarde had deuysed.
                     whan the kynge had wyttyng of the Danys, that wyth so grete a multytude were entred the prouynce of Normandy / he assembled hys hoste and sped hym thytherwarde / and in processe of tyme came vnto the cytye of Roane. where by hys counsayle it was condyscended, that a metynge and frendly communycacyon shulde be had bytwene the kynge &amp; the sayd Grolle, at a place called in Frenche Herlycum. where at the day appoynted bothe prynces mette, wyth bothe hostes standynge or hauynge a lytell dystaūce of. And whyle the two prynces were there in communycacyon of the deth and murder of duke willm̄ / a Dane markynge Herloyne (For whose causes, as before is shewed duke willm̄ was slayne) with a spere wounded hym so greuously that he dyed forthwyth, whych dede hys brother called Lambert wyth other of ye Frenchmen entendynge to reuenge, wyth theyr wepons fylle vppon the Danys / whyche them receyued with greate vyolence. So that of that a fraye ensued a skyrmysshe / and after the skyrmysshe a sore batayle. For bothe hostes ioyned on bothe sydes / and faught cruelly eyther with other a longe whyle. But in the ende the Frenchmen had the worse, and were compelled to flee. And the kynge to saue hys lyfe fledde also / whyche by reason of hys vntrusty horse was taken and kepte secrete a certayne of tyme by his taker. But lastly he was discouered and brougth to the cytye of Roane as a prysoner.

                        fort / shewyng to her that the trowble that her husbande susteyned he had well deserued, for his vnstedfastnesse that he agayne wyllyam the duke &amp; Rycharde hys sonne had vsed.
                     wherfore the quene beynge thus answered of her father / rode vnto Hugh le graunde, besechyng hym of helpe in this greate nede. The which at the request of the quene sent vnto Barnard erle of Senlys / requiryng to moue some wayes to the Danys for the enlargynge of the kynge. By whose labour and meanys lastely a counsayle was kepte at saynt Clere vpon the ryuer of Ept. where after many argumentes &amp; reasons made / fynally it was agreed that the kyng shulde be enlarged tyll an other day of cōmunycacyon / layenge for pledges hys sonne and heyre named Lothayr, the bysshop of Senlys, and ye bysshop of Beauuayze. whyche done the kynge was set at large, and forth wyth rode vnto the cytye of Laon. where he abode the other daye of cō
                        munycacyon / whyche after was holden at ye foresayd ryuer of Ept. And concluded a peas, whyche lasted but a shorte whyle after.
                     Thys peas thus confermed / Grollo the kynge of Danys wyth greate gyftes was retorned from whens he was desyred. And Richarde the yonge duke toke vpon hym the rule of hys owne Signory / and grewe and encreased forthwardly. wherof Hugh the graunde takyng hede / and beholdynge hys wyse demeanure and conuersacyon / made suche labour and meanes vnto Barnarde erle of Senlis, yt he maried to him his doughter named Emmacet. wherof beynge enfourmed the French kynge / caste in hys mynde thys greate alyaunce bytwene the yonge duke and two grete perys of hys lande / and thoughte yt these .iii. kn

                     Ottho wyth thys couetous promesse deceyued, assēbled his knyghtes / and at the day and place appoynted met wyth the kynge / and wyth theyr people sped them to Roan, and layde siege vnto ye cytye. And whyle the kynges were occupyed in wastynge and brennynge the vylages nere vnto the cytye / to put the Normans in the more fere, Ottho sent hys neuewe wyth a certayne of hys people in secrete wyse to the gates of the cytye. But whan he was comen to the gate that opened towarde the ryuer of Sayn̄, and thoughte there to wynne hys enterpryse / ye cytesyns issued out vppon hym sodeynly, and gaue to hym batayle / and slewe hym and many of hys company, and the remenaunt they chased frō the walles of the cytye.

But whan he approched the cytye, and behelde the strength therof, wyth also the fyersnesse of the Normādes / he repented

hym of enterprysyng of that iourney / and torned all hys hatered vnto Arnolde erle of Flaunders, by whose sterynge and counsayle that vyage was fyrste begon / in so mych that he sought the meanes to brynge ye sayd Arnolde into the handes of the Normans.
                     wherof Arnolde beynge warned / trussed his stuffe and harneys secretly, and in the nyght stale away / and so retorned into Flaunders with his retynew. The whych thyng knowen to the two kynges / in as secrete wise as they myghte departed also from ye siege. But yet therof theyr enmyes beynge ware / pursued them &amp; slewe many of theyr company. And or the yere that thys was done in, had rōne hys full compas, Lewys the kynge dyed and was buryed in the temple of the holy bysshoppe saynte Remygius wythin the cytye of Raynys / whan he had reygned in great trouble .xxi. yeres / leuynge for hys heyre a sonne named Lothayr.

                     In the fyrste yere of hys reygne, the Danys of Northumberland rebelled agayne hym. And for to make theyr party the strōger / they sent for a prynce of Danys named Aulaffe than beynge in Irlande. The which brought wyth hym an other prynce or ruler of Danys named Reygnald wyth a great hoste of Danys &amp; other straūge nacyons / and entred the foresayd countre, and warred vppon the next borders, in wastynge and spoylynge the inhabytaūtes of the same.
                     wherof whan kyng Edmund was warned / anone he assembled his people and sped hym toward ye countre / and lastly faught wyth the two sayd prynces of the Danys, or at the leest chaced them from towne to towne tyll he forsyd them wyth all theyr cō
                        pany of straunge nacyons to forsake vtterly that prouynce / and bet down that countre of Cumberlande yt had mych fauoured and ayded the sayde enmyes agayne hym / and toke therin greate prayes, and deuyded them amōges hys knyghtes. And ye done / other for the good seruyce that Malcolyn̄ kynge of Scotlande hadde in thys vyage done vnto the kynge, or for the trowth and allegyaunce that he in tyme folowyng shulde bere vnto hym, or for bothe / the kynge gaue there to the sayd Malcolyn̄ the countre of Cumberlande, and seased all ye resydue of the kyngdom or lordshyp of Northumberlande, and ioyned it vnto hys owne kyngdome.
                     But yet ye Danys retorned agayn in the tyme of Edredus the nexte kynge as after shalbe shewed / so that as yet the fyne or ende of thys kyngdome is not accompted.
                     In thys Edmundus dayes the authour of Polycronyca sayth, that whan Edmunde hadde ended hys iourney, and set that countree in an order / he toke wyth hym the bones of the holy abbot Colfrydus, and of that holy abbesse Hylda, &amp; brought theym vnto Glastenbury, and there shryned theym. This Colfryde was abbot of Bedas abbey, or of the abbey of Gyrwye / &amp; Hilda was abbesse of Stenshalt or whytby. And as affermeth

ye sayd authour, both places ben in ye North partyes of England.
                     Thys kynge Edwarde had a noble woman to wyfe named Elgina / of whom he receyued two sonnes named Edwyne and Edgar.
                     And as testyfyeth Henry archedekē of Huntyngdon / thys Edward had ofte warre wyth the Danes / the whyche as he affermeth helde than many good townes in myddle England, as Lyncoln̄, Nothinghm̄, Derby, Stafforde, &amp; Laycetour / ye which by his knyghtly manhode he wanne from them. And by the helpe of holy Dunstan / he amēded many thynges within his realm yt had bē lōge tyme misordered by meane of ye Danys.
                     Of the ende or fyne of thys Edmunde dyuers opynyons there be. For Marianus the Scot sayth, that whyle thys kynge Edmunde endeuered hym selfe to saue his sewer frō the daūger of hys enemye, that wold haue slayne hym at Pulkerchyrche / the kynge in ryddynge of the fraye was wounded to the deth, and dyed shortly after.
                     But wyllyam de regibus sayth, that the kynge beynge at a feest at ye foresayd towne or place, vppon the daye of saynte Augustyne / espyed a felon syttyng in ye halle named Leof, whych he before tyme for hys felony hadde exyled / and lept ouer the table and plucked that thefe by the here of the hedde to the grounde. In whych doynge the sayd felon wyth a knyfe wounded the kynge to the deth / and also wyth the same knyfe wounded many other of the kynges seruauntes / and at length was all to hewen &amp; dyed forthwyth. If this be trewe / it shulde seme that kynges at those dayes vsed not the honour that they nowe haue and exercyse. But whych of these two meanes was vsed in the kynges deth / by agreemēt of all wryters thys kynge dyed, whan he had reygned .vi. yeres and more / &amp; was buryed at Glastenbury the whyche before he hadde sumptuously repayred / and lafte after hym two yonge sonnes, as before is remembred, Edwyne and Edgar. But for they were to yonge to rule the lande / therfore ye rule therof was cōmytted to Edredꝰ theyr vncle &amp; brother to theyr fader.
                  
                  
                     THE .CLXXXIX. CHAPITER.
                     EDredus ye brother of Edmūde and sonne of Edwarde the elder, and of Ethylswyda hys thyrde wyfe / began his reygne ouer the realme of Englande, in the yere of our lorde .ix. hundred and .lxvii / and the xiii. yere of the fyfte Lewys thā kyng of Fraunce. The whych as before is towched was admytted kyng by authoryte of hys barony. For so myche as the two forenamed chylderne of Edmunde, Edwyn and Edgar, were thought to yonge and insuffycyent to take vpon them so great a charge. The whyche Edrede was enoynted kynge of Oddo archbyshop of Caū
                        terbury in ye towne of Kyngestowne. And soone after he warred vpon the Danys, that then were reentred into Northumberland / or after some wryters, there dwellynge vnder trybute of the kynge, subdued before of Edmunde hys brother / and bette theym downe, and caused theym to holde and obeye vnto theyr former couenauntes. And the Scottes than began to varye which he also brought vnto due obedyence.
                     After a certayne terme / ye Danys of Northumberlande, whyche euer contynued full of gyle and dowblenesse, not beyng content to holde the couenaūtes before made &amp; promisses vnto Edredus the kynge / called vnto theym theyr olde accessaryes and

helpers, and bereuyd from the kynges subiectes the cytye of yorke and other stronge townes and castelles, to the great hurte of the coūtrey, and vtter dyspleasure of the kynge. wherfore he beynge therof aduertysed / in goodly and conuenyent haste assembled hys people, and spedde hym thyther, and destroyed myche of the lande. And in that fury brent the abbey of Rypon, whyche the Danys kept for a fortresse and strength / and wan from them myche of the strengthes that they to fore had wōne / and broughte theym agayne vnder hys subieccyon.
                     when this kynge Edrede had thus spedde hys iourney, and was retournynge into Englande, nothynge suspectynge the sayde Danys / a company of them by the excytyng of Hyrcus a kyng or prynce of the Danys, thē folowyd the kinges hoste, and on thys halfe yorke fyll vppon the kynges rerewarde, and destroyed &amp; slew many a man. For the whyche doyng the kynge was sore amoued / &amp; tourned hys people agayne, entendynge to haue destroyed ye countrey vtterly.
                     wherof the Danys beynge ware / so lowely meked theym vnto hym, &amp; gaue to hym suche gyftes, that the kyng refrayned hym of the great yre that he had purposed to theym. But amonges other articles yt he bounde them vnto / one was that they shuld banyshe and vtterly refuse theyr fore sayde duke or kynge called Hyrcus. whyche thynge with dyuers and many other graunted &amp; fermely bounde to kepe, as well by hostages taken as other suertye / the kynge retourned into England ioynyng this kyngedome to hys other. So that here is rekened the ende of this kyngdome / whyche shulde endure as before is shewyd in the .C.ix. chapyter of thys worke, by the terme of foure hundred &amp; .ix. yeres.
                     In the same yere that the kynge hadde thus subdued the danys, a strong sykenesse toke hym / wherfore he sent for holy byshoppe Dunstane to come vnto hym. The whych Dunstane in goynge towarde the kynge / harde a voyce saye vnto hym, now restyth kynge Edredus in peace. At tyme of whych voyce thus sayenge / the horse of that holy byshop fyll to the grounde and dyed, wythout hurtynge of hys mayster.
                     Then this holy man continued his iourney, and fande the kynge dede at his commynge / whome he buryed wyth great reuerence, in the monastery or cathedrall chyrche of the cytye of wynchester, in the .xxviii. yere of his age, and the .x. yere of hys reygne, as testyfyeth Guydo and other.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXC. CHAPITER.
                     
                        LOtharius the eldest sonne of the v. Lewys / began his reygne ouer the Frenchemen, in the yere of our lordes incarnacy on .ix. hundred &amp; lv / and ye .viii. yere of Edredus then kynge of Englande. Thys Lothayr by meanes of Thebaude or Theobalde erle of Chartres, toke partye agayne Rycharde duke of Normandye. And for to haue agayn hym som groūdely cause, he sent vnto ye duke, monyshynge hym to haue in mynde, the fayth and allegyaunce that the dukes of Normandye ought to bere vnto the kynges of Fraūce. And for maynteynynge of the same, and for other maters that he hadde to speke wyth hym of / he wylled hym to come to a place appoynted, where all such

maters myght haue farther expedicion. All whyche commaundement or request was graunted of the duke.
                     when the kynge had receyued this answere from the duke, wherof he demyd before the contrary / he sent for Arnolde erle of Flaundres, Godfrey erle of Angewe, and Theobalde before named. By whose counsaylles after many argumentes made / the kynge agreed to call the duke vnto the ryuer of Isayr, &amp; there to betraye hym. At which daye &amp; place appoynted / ye duke with a cōuenyent cōpany came vnto the sayd ryuersyde, there abydyng the cōmyng of Lothayr vppon ye other syde / whyche lastly came thyther wyth a great people. wherof when the duke was ware he fered treason / for the whyche cause he sent espyes to knowe of the kynges entent. And they as wyse mē espyed all the purpose of the hoste / and shortely retourned, and shewed to the duke that he was in great daunger. The whyche shortely after apperyd / for the Frenchemen began to passe the ryuer in great nomber.
                     Then duke Rychard consyderyng that he was of so litell myght to with stande the great power of the Frēche hoste / sente a parte of his men to defende the passage, &amp; wyth the remenaunt retourned vnto the cytye of Roan̄. wherof the kynge beyng ware that the duke was hym escaped / called agayne his people, &amp; wyth great dyspleasure retourned vnto Laon.
                     It was not longe after yt the kyng assembled a great hoste of Burgonyons and Frenchemen / &amp; entred into Normandye, and beseged the cytye of Bayon, and lastly wanne it by the treason of one Gylberde a smyth belongynge vnto ye erle Theobald aboue named. when the kynge hadde thus wōne ye citye of Bayon / he betoke the kepynge therof vnto the sayde erle. The whyche puttynge therin a strength of knyghtes / yode vnto a castell called Harmauyle, &amp; besegyd yt wyth a certayn of knyghtes. In whyche season the kynge for nedes of his realme / retourned into Fraunce.
                     when duke Rycharde was ware of the kynges departure / he wyth hys people passed the water of Sayn̄ / &amp; costed the countrey, &amp; fyll sodaynely vppon erle Theobalde lyenge at the foresayd syege / and slewe of his men vi. hūdred &amp; .xl. persons / and put the erle in such a fere, that he scaped with great daunger, and fledde with smal company, tyll he came to his owne citye of Charters.
                     Then duke Rycharde consyderyng the great malice of his foon &amp; strēgth of them / sent vnto the kynge of Denmarke then named Erarde, requyryng him of ayde or helpe for to withstande the malyce of his enymyes.
                     The whych Erarde receyued gladly that message, &amp; promysed to them all theyr request / &amp; shortely after sent to the sayd duke a great army of Danys, which sped thē by ye see tyll they came to to the place where the water of Sayn̄ falleth into the see. wherof the duke beynge aduertysed, in short space drew vnto them wyth his people / and so with them entred the coū
                        trey of ye erle of Chartris, in wastyng &amp; destroynge it wythout mercy / and after entred the landes of Fraunce, in pyllynge, robbynge, brennynge, &amp; wastynge yt, and slew ye people with out mercy and pytye.
                     For this mysery &amp; tyranny thus exercysed by the Danys / ye kyng beyng therwyth confused, sente for the bysshoppes of his land, to haue theyr aduyce. Amonges the which the bishop of Chartris beynge present, was by the hole counsayll admitted to go to the duke, and knowe the cause why that he beynge a crysten man, made

suche destruccyon of the crysten people, and occupyed the land of crysten men with so manyfolde harmes and seathes / and to conclude the trew or trewce for a certayne of tyme. The sayde byshoppe accomplyssynge the kynges pleasure, was answered of the duke / that this vexacyon that he put the lande of Fraunce to, was for the iniurye yt the kyng hadde before tyme done vnto hym / &amp; yet cōtynued the same in holdynge from hym hys cytye of Bayon, the whych he hadde gyuen to his great enymy the erle of Chartris. So that in conclusyon a restraynte of warre was graunted, vppon condycyon that by a day assygned, the kynge wold apoynte a day of communycacyon / and in the meane tyme restore vnto hym hys cytye of Bayon.
                     when the kynge had receyued ye answere from the duke / he made suche meanes that ye duke receyued his city of Bayon, with all dyspeasure forgyuen agayn ye forenamed Theobald. whych was done by medyacyon of a relygyous munke, as affermeth the Frenche boke. And after the daye of metynge was appoynted at a place called Gyndolfoss. where the duke made ordynaūce for receyuynge of ye kyng / and cōmaunded the paynyms and Danis to behaue them reuerently agayne the kynge and his people / the whych was obeyed in all due maner. And ye kyng there receyued with myche honour, hadde vnto the duke many goodly wordes, requyrynge hym to forget all his former vnkyndnesse, trustynge to shewe vnto hym suche pleasures in tyme to come, that shulde recompence all the former displeasures and vnkyndnes by him before commytted. wyth whyche fayre speche the duke takynge yt wythout dyssymulacyon, was well satysfyed and content / so that after assuraunce of amytye and peace betwene theym stablysshed, eyther gyuynge vnto other great and ryche gyftes, they departed as frendes. The whych peas contynued durynge theyr lyues.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXCI. CHAPITER.
                     LOthayre thus beyng in loue and amytye wyth the Normans / caste in his mynde howe he myght wynne from his neuewe Otthon kynge of Germany, ye prouynce of Austracy or Lorayn, yt in tyme passed was belongynge to his progeny tours. And this to brynge to effecte / he gaderyd in right secret wyse a chosen host of Frenchemen, &amp; with them passed the countrey, in such wise that he was entred the cytye of Aquisgrani, or any great fame or noyse were therof made. wherwith Ottho beyng dysmade / fledde for that season, &amp; suffred the sayde Lothayr for that tyme to execute his pleasure / so yt the sayd Lothayre spoyled the kynges paleys and other places, to the great enrychinge of hym &amp; his hoste. And when he hadde taryed there a certayne of tyme, he retourned wythout batayll wyth great pompe into Fraunce.
                     It is shewyd before in the begynnyng of the story of Ethelstane kyng of England / that Henry duke of Saxony, the whyche is ment for Germany, sent vnto the sayde Ethilstane to haue his suster Alunda to mary vnto his sonne Ottho or Otthon.
                     ye shall vnderstande this Henry is of some wryters admytted for emperour. But his sonne Ottho forenamed, was emperour in dede / whose sonne this Ottho was abouenamed, and called the seconde of that name, and emperour after hys father, and son of the forenamed Alunda suster to Ethilstane.
                     Then this second Ottho emperour

&amp; kyng of Germany, beyng thus as ye haue hard surprised of his neuew Lothayre kyng of west Fraunce / gaderyd a stronge hoste and entred the realm of Fraūce. And as wytnessyth Gerardus wryter of hystoryes, destroyed the coūtrey of Soysons / and lastly came vnto Paris, and brent ye suburbes of that cytye, and hadde a great parte of his wyll of the sayde Lothayre. But the frenche cronycle varyeth from this saynge / and sayth that Lothayr (by the helpe of the duke of burgoyne and of Hugh Capet erle of Paris, after ye sayd Otthō had fyred the suburbes of the citye of Parys) issued out of the towne &amp; faught wyth the emperoure, and compelled him to gyue backe and fle. whom the kynge pursued tyll he came to the ryuer of Isayr or Sue / where eyther hoste encoūtred wyth other &amp; faught cruelly. But at length the emperour was forced to forsake ye feld / &amp; mych of his people slayn and droned with in the said ryuer. And so grete a nomber as affermeth the frenche storye / that the course of the water was stopped, and ouerflowed the feldes nere vnto the sayde ryuer.
                     But this victory not wythstādyng as wytnessyth mayster Gagwyn / the kynge cōtrary the mynde of the duke of Burgoyne, and also of Hugh Capet / releasyd vnto the emperour the tytle and ryghte of Lorayne. The whyche was cause of couetynge of the realme by the sayde Hugh, and vsurpynge of the same, as affermeth the sayde authoure. whyche agrement betwene the two princes stablisshed and ended, eyther retourned into his own countrey. After the which season no notable dede is put in memory of the sayde Lothayre / so that he fynally sykened and dyed, in the yere of our lorde .ix hundred .lxxx. &amp; vi, when he had ruled his pryncypat vygurously by the full terme of .xxx. wynter / and was buried in the mynster of saynte Remigius in the cytye of Raynes, leuynge after hym a son named Lewys.

                        Edredus or Edwyne the eldeste son of Edmund brother of Ethil stane / began his reygne ouer Englande, in the yere of our lord .ix. hundred &amp; .lvi / and the second yere of Lothayre then kynge of Fraunce. This Edwyne was crowned kynge at Kyngistone or Kyngestowne besyde London, of the archbyshoppe of Caunterbury. The whych selfe daye of his ꝓfessyon or coronacion / broke sodeynly from his lordes, &amp; entred a secrete chāber, &amp; there occupyed him selfe synfully wyth a nother mannes wyfe. wherof saynt Dūstane hauyng knowlege, rebuked and blamed hym greuously / &amp; caused the woman to be voyded from his bed and company. whose husband as one authour testyfyeth he slew, for to haue ye vnlawful vse of her beaute / not cōsideryng ye allyaūce of affynyte of kynred betwene them, affermeth ye sayde authour.
                     Guydo writer of storyes sayth, that Edwyn cōtrary ye lawes of ye chyrch, held a woman as his cōcubyne. wherfore holy Dūstane accused him vnto Oddo archbishop of Caūterbury, by whose power the kynge was causyd to refuse &amp; forsake the cōpany of that woman. For the which dede Edwyn bare great malice vnto the holy man Dunstane / &amp; at length by his extorte power, banyshed hym his lande, and forced hym for a season to holde hym

in Flaunders. And for the malyce ye he bare towarde hym, he dyd myche dyspleasure to all blacke munkes of Englande / in so myche that at Malmysbury he put oute the mōkes and set in seculer prestes in theyr stede.
                     It is rad of hym that he also toke from the chyrch what he myght / and specyally from the blacke monkes. In so myche that such precyouse iewellys as Ethylstane hadde before receyued from Othon̄ the emperour, gyuē vnto wynchester and Malmysbury / he toke theym thens and gaue theym vnto alyauntes and straungers. And thus was not onely vnkynde to god / but also he vsyd suche tyranny, and other vnlefull meanes to hys subiectes, that lastely they rebelled agayn hym / and specyally the inhabytaūtes of the countre of Mercia or myddell Englande, and also of Northumbers / and put hym clerely from all kyngely honour and dygnytye, when he had reygned after most wryters the full terme of .iiii. yeres / and was buryed after in ye cathedrall chyrche of wynchester, leuynge none heyre of his body / wherfore the rule of the lande fyll vnto Edgar his yonger brother.
                     Antoninus archebyshop of Florēce in this worke often before mynded, amonges many myracles and vertues actes, which he in ye .vi. chapiter of ye .xvi. title of his boke called Sm̄ Antonini / reherseth of this holy man Dunstan̄, &amp; sayth that when he had vnderstandynge of the deth of thys Edwyn̄ by reuelacyon or otherwyse, he made hys specyall prayer to god to know what state the soule of Edwyn̄ was in. To whome after thys prayer made / apperyd to the sayde Dūstane a great company of fēdes, turmentynge the soule of the sayde Edwyn, and ledynge yt vnto the places of peyne. The whyche when this holy man hadde sene, he fell to great wepynge and sorowe / besechynge god with most deuocyon to haue pytye and compassyon of that soule. And whyle he was occupied in his prayer, the sayde cōpany of fendes returned wyth yellynge and cryenge / shewynge to hym that thorough hys prayer, the angelles of god had byrafte from them the soule of Edwyn.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXCIII. CHAPITER.
                     EDgar the seconde sonne of Edmunde and brother of Edwyn laste kynge / began hys reygne ouer the realme of Englande, in the yere of our lorde .ix. hundred and .lx / and the .v. yere of Lotharius then kynge of Fraunce. The whyche of dyuers wryters is wytnessed to be of the age of .xvi. yere, when he was admytted for kynge / and that he was not crowned kynge tyll he hadde reygned the full terme of .xii. yeres. whych terme ended and expyred / he was enoynted and crowned kynge in the cytye of Bathe, vppon a whytsondaye / fallyng then vpon the .xv. day in May, of Dunstane and Oswolde byshoppes, that one of Caunterburye, and that other of yorke.
                     In the begynnynge of his reygn he called home holy Dunstane / that before was exyled of kyng Edwyne / whych Dunstane harde aungellys synge, peace be to the lande of Englyshemen.
                     Then he made Dūstane that was abbot of Glastenburye, byshoppe of worceter / and vnyed and knyt into one, the prouynce and lorshyppes of Englande, and made of theym one monarchye and kyngedome.
                     In many places he putte away clerkes and prestes that lyued vycyously / and sette there for theym munkes. And as wytnessyth Guydo, Policronica,

and other / he buylded and repayred to the nomber of .xl. houses of relygyon / wherof Abyndon, Peterburgh, Thorney, Ramesey, and wylton̄ were parcell of theym.
                     And at wynchester in the newe abbay he putte in munkes / where before dayes were seculer prestes. The cause wherof was, for so myche as the prestes fled or neglygently slowthed the dyuyne seruyce of god, and sette vykers in theyr places, whyle they lyued at theyr pleasure in other places, and spente the patrymonye of that chyrche after theyr sensuall wyll.
                     Then kynge Edgar gaue to the vykers the lande that before belonged to the prebendaryes / trustynge therby that they wolde do theyr duetyes. But yt was not longe to, or the sayd vycares were as neglygent as the other. wherfore fynally, the kyng by authoryte of pope Iohn̄ the .xiii. of that name, voyded clerely the prestes &amp; ordeyned there mōkes / though some of hys prelates where not therwyth contented.
                     This Edgar kepte suche iustyce, and dyd so sharpe execucyon / that neuer before his days was vsyd lesse felony or robberyes. And for he wold haue the rauenous bestes destroyed thorough hys lande / he caused Ludwallus prynce or kynge of walys, to yelde to hym yerely by way of trybute thre hundred woluys. By meane wherof wythin the space of .iiii. yeres after, in Englande and walys myght scantely be founden one wolf a lyue.
                     It is wytnessyd of dyuers authours that Kynadus kynge of Scotlande dispysed Edgar, for that that he was lytell of stature. wherof Edgar beynge warned / desyred the sayd Kynadus to dyner, and made to him good countenaunce. After whych dyner ended / he toke the sayd Kynadus by ye arme, and so wyth hym helde company tyll they came into ye feldes. where beynge dysseuered from bothe theyr seruauntes / Edgar drew from vnder his garment two swordes, &amp; desyred Kynadus to take the chose of theym, &amp; sayd to hym: nowe thou hast good laysure to a saye thy strength wyth myne, that before tyme thou haste so myche dyspysed. And lette vs nowe proue whyche is more worthy to be subiecte to other. It is not syttynge for a knyghte to make great boste at the borde, and to do lytell in felde. when the Scottyshe kynge hard the kyng thus challenge hym / he knew well his wordes before spoken were disclosyd to ye kynge / wherof he was not a litle abashed. But for apeace ye kynge / he behaued hym so lowely, and gaue to hym suche plesaunte wordes, that the kynge forgaue the trespace.
                     This Edgar amonge other of hys polytyke dedes / vsed in the somer tyme to scowre the see wyth certayne shyppes of warre. And agayn ye wynter he prouyded to laye the sayd shyppes in sure hauens / and had redy in his owne seruyce, and in hys lordes houses, a certayne nomber of so
                           •
                        dyours that were alway redy when the kyng had nede of them. And his shyp maysters were in wages wyth hym thorough the yere / that euer attēdyd vpon the shippes, to se that nothyng fayled that vnto theym was necessary. By meane wherof he kepte hys land in great quyete fro outward enmyes. And in the wynter he vsed to ryde ouer the land, and to se how hys offycers entreated the people. And yf any were accused of extorcyon or other crymes, and agayne them suffycyently proued / he dyd vppon all suche sharpe correccyon.
                     And for so mych as in his days grete

multytude of Danys dwelled in dyuers places of England, which vsed many vyces / &amp; specyally great drynkynge, wherof ensued dronkenesse and many other vices, to the euyll examples and hurte of hys commons and subiectes: he therfore ordeyned certayne cuppes with pynnes or nayles set in them / and ordeyned &amp; made a law, that what person dranke past that marke at one drought, shuld for fayte a certayn peny. wherof the one half shuld fall to the accusour, &amp; that other half to the ruler of ye brough or towne that the offence was done in.
                     It is told of this Edgar by dyuers authours, yt he vpon a season beyng at Chester, entred ye ryuer of Dee / &amp; there syttynge in a bote, toke the rule of the helme, and caused .viii. kynges, whyche of Guydo are called regul
                           •
                        , whyche is to meane small or lytell kynges or vnder kinges, ye whyche he commaunded to rowe hym vp and downe the ryuer vnto saynte Iohn̄s chyrche, and from thens to hys owne paleys / in token yt he was lorde &amp; kynge of so many prouynces.
                     This noble Edgar had two wyues. By the fyrste yt was called Egelfleda the whyte / he hadde a son that was named Edwarde. He was after kynge, and slayne by reason of hys stepmoder Alfrita, called in the englyshe cronycle Estrylde. And vpon his seconde wyfe Alfrida or Estrylde he gat a son named Egelredus, or after the englyshe boke Eldrede / which was kynge after Edwarde the martyr, as after shall be shewyd. And of saynte wylfryth, whych of some wryters is accōpted for a mēchon, he had a doughter named saynte Edyth in ꝓcesse of ryme. But this was of bast and not in wedloke. For as Guydo and Policronicon testyfyen / this virgyne wylfryth knowynge that the kyng caste to her vnlawfull loue, put vppon her the habyte of a nūne, thynkyng thereby to wythdrawe the kynges loue. But that not wythstandynge, she was at length brought to the kynges bedde. For whych dede he was greatly blamed of the holy byshop Dunstane / and dyd therfore vii. yere penaūce, by the heste or byddynge of the sayde Dunstane. And the forenamed wylfrith after ye chyld borne lyued so relygyousely / yt she is now cōpted for a saynt in heuen. Of her doughter Edyth yt is radde, that at lawefull age she was at wylton̄ shorne a nunne / where she vsyd more gayer apparell then was thought cō
                        uenyent to her religyon. For ye which she beynge blamed of the holy bysshop Ethelwolde answered. Goddes dome that maye not fayle is pleasyd onely wyth conscyence. wherfore I truste that vnder these clothes maye be as clene a soule, as vnder other ye ben of lasse shewynge. Many vertues ben rehersed of this holy virgyn Edyth, in the .ix. chapyter of the .vi. boke of Policronycon. The which I passe ouer for length of the mater.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXCIII. CHAPITER.
                     EDgar thus rulynge the lande after the deth of his fyrst wyfe Egelfleda / worde was broughte to hym of ye beaute of Alfrida or Estrild doughter of Orgarus erle of Deuenshire. wherfore he sent a knight of his court named Ethelwold, to espy whether the mayde were of such beautye as she was reported of or not / chargynge hym yf she were so beautyous, that then he shulde aske her to wyfe for the kynge.
                     But this knyght hauyng syght of this mayden, was so wounded wyth the darte of the blynde god Cupyde, that he forgate his trouth and allegiaunce, yt he shuld owe to his mayster

and souerayne / and retourned, shewynge to the kynge, that she was nothynge of the beaute that she was reported of, but of meane fayrenesse as other women were. wherfore he besought the kynge consyderyng she was her fathers heyre &amp; a good maryage / that he wolde be so good lord to hym as to wryte vnto her fader, yt he myght haue her to wyfe. The why the grace he obteyned, and at length was maryed vnto her.
                     In processe of tyme the fame of the beaute of thys woman sprange so wyde, that lastly yt came to the erys of Edgar. wherwyth the kynge in mynde beynge sore dyscontentyd wyth Ethilwolde, whyche hym had dysceyued / yet kepte good countenaunce, and made semblaunte, as though he hadde nothynge forced yt mater. And vpon a tyme as yt were in game / warned this Ethilwolde, yt then was an erle by reason of hys wyfe or otherwyse, that he wold lodge one nyght in his house / &amp; appoynted the daye when yt shulde be. wyth thys monyssyon the erle beynge nothynge contented / ranne home nygh deed for fere, and prayed his wyfe of helpe in that tyme of nede, and yt she wold in all that she myght make her self as fowle and as vnsemely as she coude / and shewed to her all the resydue of ye mater. Then ye woman cast in her mynde the great dyspleasure yt might ensue toward her agayn god, to make that fowle, whych he hadde made goodly and fayre / and also to her lorde and husbande agayne the kynge, thynkyng that he shuld cause her thus to do, to the ende to mocke and dysceyue hym. wherfore in consyderacyon of the premysses, she enourned her in moste costly and shewynge aparayll. And ouer yt yf dame nature hadde had any thynge forgoten or mysprinted in her / she left not that by womās helpe might be amended or refourmed / and at the kynges cōmynge receyued hym wyth all ioy and gladnesse. By whyche meanes this yonge amorous kyng was soon caught in the dyuylles snare / so that he sette reason a parte, and folowed his own sensualyte. And for to bryng his purpose the better about, he kept forth a countenaunce as he had ben well contentyd wyth all thynge, and desyred the erle, that he wolde wyth hym ryde on huntyng into the wood of welwerley that now is called hore wood / where he awaytynge his season &amp; tyme, strake the erle thorough the bodye wyth his shafte / so that he dyed soon after. And then he maryed this Elfryda or Estrylde shortely, &amp; hadde by her Egelredus as before I haue shewyd. For the whyche dede sayth Ranulf, this Elfrida buylded an house of nunnes at warwell. But other authours saye, yt was for the slayeng of her stepson Edwarde.
                     Also the englyshe cronycle sheweth that this Ethilwolde was slayne by an other meane and not by the kyng.
                     About this tyme dyed Oddo archbyshoppe af Caunterbury, that was of the nacyon of Danys. Of hym is tolde a longe processe in the .x. chapyter of the .vi. boke of Polycronycon. And after hym Bryglinus, that then was byshoppe of wynchester, was made hys successour. But for he was not suffycyent for so great a charge / he went agayne to wynchester. And holy Dunstane byshop of London &amp; of worceter, was sacryd archbysshoppe of Caunterbury / and went to Rome and receyued the palle of pope Iohn̄ the .xiii. of that name. This Dunstane was fyrste abbot of Glastynbury, and byshoppe of London &amp; worceter, and lastely archbyshoppe of Caunterbury. In his dayes the order of munkes was religyous and

Full of vertues. For it hadde relygyous rulers, clere of scyence and of clergy / so that then men were lad as mych wyth other dedes and good examples of vertuous lyuynge as by theyr famous &amp; vertuous prechyng.
                     Than Edgare as before ys sayde was crowned kynge at the cytye of Bathe, of Dunstane archbysshop of Caunterbury, and Oswolde archbysshop of yorke, whan he hadde ruled thys lande .xii. yeres. The cause why it was so longe or this Edgar were enoynted / was as testyfyeth Guydo for hys vnlefull Lechery, and specyally for the offence done wyth wylfryde. For the whyche dede he was of Dunstane ioyned to .vii. yeres penaunce. The whyche penaunce durynge, he was kept from the sayd enoyntement as affermeth the sayde Guydo. But for what cause so euer it was / by agrement of dyuers wryters, he was not crowned tyll he had reygned .xii. yeres.
                     It is also tolde of thys Edgare, that he beynge vpon a season at the towne of And
                           •
                        uyr / he was enamoured vpon a noble mannes doughter whyche was of passynge beautye / &amp; made suche meanes by force or other wyse, that the parentes were agreed that the kynge shulde haue hys pleasure. But the moder subtyll of wytte bethoughte her of a whyle / and sent a seruaunt of hers, whych was both comely and fayre to the kynges bed. In the mornynge whan the daye began to waxe clere / the woman began to styrre, and wolde haue departed from the kynge. But the kynge refrayned her and asked the cause of her so hasty departyng. For I muste be at my worke wyth my felowes sayde the woman, at myne houre to kepe my taske. And whan the kynge had questyoned wyth her further, he lerned that she was a bonde woman / and asked of the kynge fredome for y• nyghtis seruyce. The kyng at this had good game / and cherysshed that damosell so after, that he made her lady of Lordes. For these insolent &amp; wanton dedes / it is sayde that by the counsayle of the holy Dunstane, he buylded &amp; repayred so many abbeys and houses of relygyon as aboue is rehersed.
                     Thus thys noble Edgare passyng his tyme in vertue medled with vyce lastly had wyttynge of the rebellyon of ye Brytaynes or walshmen, wherfore he assembled hys knyghtes, and entred the lande, and dyd them grete harme and waste. And among other prayes, spoyled the countre of Glamorgan̄ / and also toke or spoyled the countre of Ono / and toke the bell of saynt Eltutus, which serued for hys chyrche, that was taken by vyolence wyth other stuffe, &amp; hanged it about an horse necke. In puttynge it to tē
                        porall seruyce to the dyspleasure of that saynte. But for the vyolent takynge therof, as Ranulf expresseth / in an vndertyde whan kyng Edgar was layde to take hys reste, the sayd Eltutus apered and smote the kyng vppon the breste wyth a spere. So yt the kynge awoke wyth that stroke / and charged that the belle shulde be restored to the chyrche of Saynt Eltutus, and all other thynges that were taken wyth the same. But the kynge dyed wythin .x. dayes after / whan he had reygned after moste wryters the full terme of .xvi. yeres. And was buryed at Glastenbury / leuynge after hym two sonnes, Edwarde the martyr &amp; Egelredꝰ, by .ii. sondry wyues.
                     Henricus the hystographer made of hym these verses folowynge.
                     
                        Ayder of the poore, and punyssher of trespasse,
                        The gyuer of worshyp, kyng Edgar is now gone
                        
                           To the kyngdome of heuen / whyche lyke to prayse was
                        As Salomon, that for wysdome aboue all shone
                        A fader in peas, a lyone to his foone
                        Founder of temples, of monkes stronge patrone,
                        Oppresser of all wronge, and of iustyce guardone.
                     
                     WIllelmus de regibus testifyeth, that in the yere of our lorde .M.lii, whiche was after the deth of this noble kynge Edgar .lxxvi. yeres / an abbot of Glastenbury named Aylewarde, dygged the graue of this noble man vnreuerently. At whyche tyme the body was foūden hole and so full of flesshe, that the body wolde not entre into a newe cheste without pressynge. By reason wherof fresshe droppes of blode issued out of the same body. Than the abbot foresayd fyll sodeynly madde, and went out of the chyrch, and brake hys necke, and so dyed. Than the body was put in a shryne that he before tyme had gyuen to the place, &amp; set vppon ye auter / wyth the hed of saynt Apolinare and other relyques of saynt Uyncent, the whych ye kyng Edgare before dayes had brought thyther and gyuen to ye house. wherfore it maye well appere to all that rede thys story, that what lyuynge thys man was demed of, yt he purged hym in suche wyse by penaūce, that he made a seth and amendes to goddes pleasure.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXCV. CHAPITER.
                     IN ye story of thys noble prynce Edgare, I fynde wryten a story, the whyche is alleged by the authour, yt it shulde be done by a kyng of Syrye named Cambyses, in the tyme of the reygne of thys Edgare. But in that sayenge he varyeth frō other authours and wryters very farre / as Uincencius hystorialis, Antoninus, Ranulphus and other. For all be it the sayde acte was done by ye sayd Cambyse, as the forenamed authoure affermeth / yet it was by the sayd Cambyses executed, longe before the incarnacyon of Cryste. For thys Cambyses was the sonne of Cirus kyng of Parsys and of Medis, whyche reygned ouer those prouynces about the yere of the worlde .iiii. thousand .lxx, before the commynge of Cryste folowyng the accompte of thys worke .xi. hundred yeres &amp; .xxix. But it myghte be, yt the whyte monke that was authoure or wryter of this acte to the story of Edgare / was moued for the greate iustyce that he radde in the story of thys Edgare, thynkyng to enhaunce it by the reason herof / where he sayth that in the tyme of thys Cābyses, a iudge was to hym accused and conuycte vppon the same accusacyon, that he hadde gyuen a wronge sentence by meane of takynge of mede. wherfore thys Cambyses to the terrour and fere of other / commaunded the sayde iudge to be flayne quycke, and the skynne to be spred ouer the place or stole of iudgement / and that done, made the sone of the foresayd iudge to sytte as iudge in the place, where hys fader before sat / wyth these verses wryten vppon the face of the sayde place of iudgement as foloweth.

                           Sede sedens ista, iudex inflexibilis sta,

                     whyche verses maye be englysshed in maner and fourme as foloweth.

                           Thou that syttest in thys iudycyall place,

                     AS I haue before shewed this acte was put in execucyon ye xi.C. yere and odde before the commynge of Cryste. And syns the sayd cōmynge or incarnacyon haue expyred .xv. hundred yeres &amp; more / which all maketh ouer two thousande .vi. hundred yeres. In all whyche tyme I haue nat radde in any cronycle of thys lande nor other where, that any iudge hath ben put to lyke sentence. wherfore it is to presuppose, that in the lawes bothe spyrytuall &amp; temporall / all iudges haue wel borne these verses in mynde, and exercysed them in mynystrynge of dewe iustyce, as perfytely as theyr cusshons had ben fresshely lyned wyth the foresayde skinne / &amp; emprīted so narowly these verses in the boke of theyr cōscience, that they in all theyr iudgementes set asyde all parcyalyte and fauour / and holde theyr handes from all medes and rewardes / so that now it is thus wyth more, or ellys thus it shulde be.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXCVI. CHAPITER.
                     EDwarde the sonne of Edgare and of hys fyrste wyfe named Egelfleda / beganne hys reygn ouer thys realme of Englande, in the yere of our lorde .ix. hundred and .lxxvii / and the .xii. yere of Lothayre than kynge of Fraunce.
                     ye shall vnderstand that after the deth of Edgare / stryfe arose amonge the lordes for admyssyon of theyr kyng. For Elfryda or Estrylde with Alphrede duke of Mercia / made dyuers frendes to haue her sonne Egelredus promoted to that dygnite, a chylde of .vii. yeres of age, that she &amp; he myghte haue the rule of the land. But holy Dunstane wyth ayde of other bysshoppes, and of the erle of eest Englande or Essex / wythstode so that doynge, that he crowned thys Edwarde kynge at ye towne of Kyngestowne / to the greuous dyspleasure of hys sayd moder Elfryda and other of her affynyte.
                     In the tyme of thys Edward appered stella cometa, a blasing sterre / wherafter ensued many inconuenyences as well to men as to bestes, as sykenesse, hunger, moreyne, &amp; other lyke myseryes. But none of this fyll in the dayes of this Edwarde, but after hys deth. The forenamed Alpherus duke of Mercia, whyche in all thynges fauoured mych the dedes of the quene / put out ye monkes at wynchester, that kyng Edgare as before is shewed had there set in / &amp; brought in for theym wanton clerkes / or as Ranulphe sayth clerkes wyth concubynes. But Dunstane and the erle of Essex wythsayde that doyng / and helde agayne the duke and suche as fauoured hys partye. For the whych arose greate stryfe bytwene the prestes and the monkes of Englande. For ye clerkes that were before tyme put out by Edgare / sayd that it were a wretched and cursed dede, that a newe comon company vnknowen shulde put out olde landysmen from theyr place / nor it shulde not be pleasyng to god yt had graunted ye place to the olde wōner / nor no good man ought to alowe suche doynge, for the ensample that therof myght ensewe.

The monkes sayde yetCryste alowed nother the olde dweller, nor yet the persone. But who so wolde take the crosse of penaunce vppon hym, and folow Cryste in vertuous lyuynge / he shulde be hys dyscyple. For thys was holden a generall counsayle of bysshoppes and all the clergy of the land at wynchester / where holy Dū
                        stane helde wyth the vertuous. And whyle they were there in greate argument for thys mater, as dyuers wryters testyfyē / a rode there beyng or standynge in the wall spake myraculously, and sayd that Dunstanes wayes was good and trewe. But for all thys the stryfe seased not. In so mych that a new assemble of the clergye and other was appoynted after at a place called the strete of Calue / where the counsayle was kept in an vpper lofte. In thys counsayle Dū
                        stane was greuously despysed and rebuked of some vnskylfull mē. But yet he kept hys opynyon grounded vpon iustyce and vertue. And whyle they were there in thys greate dyuysyon and argument, whyche waye shulde be admytted and alowed / sodeynly the ioystes of the lofte fayled, and the people fell downe, so yt many were slayne &amp; greuously hurte. But holy Dunstane escaped, wyth fewe other that toke hys partye vnhurte. This wonder with the other, caused sylence amonges them that entēded to maynteyne this foresayd quarell / so that Dunstane had all hys wyll.
                     Thus passynge the tyme of the reygne of Edwarde the kynge / he came vppon a season from huntyng in the forest or woode after some wryters, nere to the castell of Corfe in ye west countre. where he losynge hys company and seruauntes, resorted vnto the castell before sayd / where at that tyme hys moder with her sonne Egelredꝰ kept her housholde. whan the quene was warned of hys commynge / anone she called to a seruaūt of hers whych she mych trusted, and tolde to hym all her counsayle / shewynge to hym forther how he shulde behaue hym in accomplysshynge of her wyll and mynde. And that done / she went towarde the kynge, and receyued hym wyth all outwarde gladnesse / and desyred hym to tary wyth her that nyght. But he in curteyse maner excused hym selfe / &amp; for spede desyred to drynke vpon hys horse syttyng, ye whych was shortly brought.
                     And whyle the cuppe was at hys mouth / the seruaunt before of the quene enfourmed, strake hym to the herte wyth a sworde or a longe dagger sharpe on both sydes. After whiche stroke by the kynge receyued / he toke the horse wyth the spores and ranne towarde the place that he was comen fro, or ellys suche waye as he supposed to mete of hys company. But he bled so sore that for fayntnes he fyll from hys horse, hys one fote beynge faste in the styrroppe. By reason wherof he was drawen of ye horse ouer wayes and feldes, tyll he came to a place named than Corysgate, where he was founden dede. And for ye maner of hys deth was vnknowē
                        ▪ and also he for kynge not knowen / he was buryed vnworthely at the towne of warehm̄, and there rested by the terme of .iii. yeres after. In whyche tyme and season god shewed for hym dyuers myracles / as syghte to the blynde, helthe to the syke, and herynge to ye defe, wyth dyuers other whyche I ouer passe.
                     wherof herynge hys stepmoder, began to take repentaunce, and entended to vysyte hym by way of pylgrymage. But how or for what cause she entended inwardly I can nat saye / but the horse or beest yt she rode vpon, myght not nyghe ye place / by a

certayne space, for betynge or any other thynge that to hym myght be done by man. But after this by her meanes he was translated from thēs to Septon̄, that now is called Shaftesbury / &amp; there buried with great honour. But syn that tyme parte of his bodye was translated to the abbaye of Leof besyde Hereforde in the edge of walys / and some parte therof to Abyndon̄. And yt is reported that at Shaftesbury remayne hys lunges / and ben shewed in the place that is called Edwardysstowe.
                     For the murder of this blessed man / yt is sayde as before is shewed in the story of Edgar, that his stepmother foūded two monasteryes of women / ye one at Ambrisbury, and that other at warwell. In the whyche place of warwell in her latter dayes, she refusynge the pompe of the worlde, helde there a solytary and strayte lyfe / and ended her lyfe wyth great penaunce and repentaunce, and was there buryed when she dyed.
                     Thus as ye haue harde was this vertuous yonge kynge Edwarde martyred, whē he had reygned after most wryters .iiii. yeres, leuyng none yssue / wherfore the rule of the lande fyll to Egelredus his brother.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXCVII. CHAPITER.
                     EGelredus the sonne of Edgar and Alfrida or Estryld his last wyfe / beganne his reygne ouer Englande, in the yere of our lorde .ix hū
                        dred &amp; .lxxxi / and the .xxvi. yere of Lothayre then kynge of Fraunce.
                     This is named of some wryters Etheldredus, and in the englyshe cronycle Eldrede. In whose begynnyng the grounde waxed bareyne / and all myseryes before bodyd by the apperynge of the blasynge starre, in the dayes of Edwarde the martyr, nowe beganne to take place and encreace vppon the erth. This as the other of his ꝓgenytours, was crowned kyng at Kyngestone, of the holy archbysshoppe Dunstane, and of Oswalde archebyshop of yorke. To whome as yt is redde in the lyfe of saynt Dunstane amonges his prophecyes / that in the day of his coronacyon, he sayd vnto the kynge: for thou comest to this kingdome by the deth of thy brother, in whose deth Englyshemen cō
                        spyred with thy wykked moder / they shall not be wythout blood shedynge and sworde, tyll there come people of vnknowen tunge, and brynge them into thraldome. And thys trespace shall not be clensyd wythoute longe vengeaunce.
                     Of this Egelredꝰ wryters agreen, that he was goodly of shappe and of vysage / but that was mynged wyth lechery and cruelty. It is also redde that when holy Dunstane shuld crysten hym / as he helde hym ouer the fonte, he felyd the holy lyker wyth ye fruyte of his wombe. wherfore holy Dunstane sware by god and by hys mother / this shalbe vnkynde to god and his chyrche. whych fayled not in his forth goynge / for he was vngracyous in his begynnynge, wretched in ye myddell of his lyfe, and hatefull to men in the ende therof.
                     In the seconde yere of his reygn / a cloude was sene in Englande, the whyche appered halfe lyke blood, &amp; the other halfe lyke fyre / and chaunged after into sundry colours, &amp; dysaperyd at the laste. In the thyrd yere of his reygn, ye Danys aryued in sundry places of his lande / as in the yle of Thanet besyde Kente, in Cornewayll, and Sussex, and dyd in those costes myche harme. And after some of theym came to London / but there they were put of. How be yt they destroyed a great part of Chestershyre.
                     
                        And in the ende of the same yere, a great parte of the cytye of London was wasted with fyre. But how it beganne myne authour myndeth not. But ye shall vnderstand, that at this daye the cytye of London had moste housynge and buyldynge from Ludgate towarde westmester / and lytell or none where ye chefe or herte of the cytye is nowe / excepte in dyuers places was housing, but they stode with oute order. So that many townes and cytyes, as Caunterbury, yorke, and other dyuers in Englande / passed London in buyldynge at those days, as I haue sene or knowē by an olde boke somtyme in the Guyldehal of London named Domys day. But after the cōquest yt encreaced &amp; shortly after passed &amp; excelled all ye other.
                     About the .viii. yere of this kynges reygne / the kynge maryed erle Egbertus doughter named Ethelgina or Elgina. Of the whyche in processe of time he receyued a son named Edmunde, whyche after was surnamed Ironsyde / and .ii. other sonnes named Edwyn and Ethylstane, and a doughter named Edgina.
                     In this pastyme dyed saynt Ethilwalde byshop of wynchester. He was borne in wynchester, and noryshed vnder holy Dunstane at Glastenbury, and there shorne monke / and after was chosen abbot of Abyndon, in the tyme of the reygne of kynge Edredus. And in the tyme of Edgar he was sacryd byshoppe of wynchester / where he made an abbay of nunnes, and translated saynt Swythynes body out of the erth.
                     After whyche sayde Ethelwalde, holy Alphegus abbot then of Bathe was sacred byshoppe of wynchester / the whyche after was archebishoppe of Caunterbury, and martyred hastely of the cruell Danys, as after shall be shewed.
                     About the .ix. yere of Egelredus / for stryfe yt was betwene the byshop of Rochester and hym, he wyth his knyghtes beseged the sayde cytye. wherof holy Dūstane sent to ye kyng, amonyssynge hym that he shulde refrayne hym of that cruelty, &amp; suffre ye byshop and his citye in peace, oneles that he offended saynte Andrewe patrone of that citye. But this message mylded nothyng ye kynges courage. Then thys blessed man sent to hym a hundred pounde in gold, wyllyng hym to refrayne of that outrage / the whyche he receyued and brake the syege. Then blessyd Dunstane sente this message to the kyng: For thou haste preferred golde before god, and syluer before the apostle, and couetyse before me / right so euyll happes shall come vnto the, but not whyle I am in lyfe. But the kynge toke lytell regarde to those wordes, but contynued in his insolent &amp; cursed dedes.
                     About the .xi. yere of his reygne, dyed that blessed archbyshoppe saynte Dunstane. Of whom Ranulff in the xiii. chapyter of his .vi. boke of Policronycon, maketh rehersall of dyuers of his vertues and myracles / the whyche I passe ouer, and the rather bycause his legēde or lyfe is manyfest. Siricus was archbyshop after hym, &amp; after hym wulricus. And after wulricus, blessed Elphegꝰ was archbyshop of that see.
                     It was not longe after the deth of holy Dunstane, but that the Danys perced England in many and sondry places of the lande / in suche wyse that the kynge was to seke, to which coste he shuld go fyrst to wythstande his enymyes. And in conclusyon in auoydynge of more harme / he was compellyd to appeace theym wyth great summes of money. But when ye money was spent / they fyll to new robbynge of the people. Then the

kynge graunted more money. But for all that the Danys robbed and spoyled ye coūtrey of Northūberlād, and besyeged London at the laste. And for augmentacyon of the kynges sorowe / Elfricus that then was mayster or admyrall of the kynges nauy, fled as a false traytour. And after that recōcyled &amp; fled the second tyme to the Danys. wherfore ye kyng in wreche of the father / commaūded the eyen of his sonne Algarus, to be plucked or done out of his hedde.
                     But whyle this persecucion thus contynued / by meanes of the holy byshoppe of wynchester Elphegus, a peace was concluded for a tyme betwene the kyng and the Danys. And the prynce or chefe captayne of them named Aulaff, was so exorted by the said holy byshop / yt he became a cristē man, to whome the kynge was godfather / so that after the sayde Aulaff retorned to his owne, without doyng of more harme / so that for a whyle the warre of Danys seased.
                     But whyle that rested / the blody flyx wyth a brennynge feuer vexed the people thorough the lande, that myche folke therof dyed.
                     Contynuynge whyche mysery / the Danys agayne assayled the lande, &amp; dyd in dyuers places great harme / so that for lacke of a good hed or gouernour, many thynges in the land peryshed. For the lordes were at such dyssencyon that one with that other / that when they were assembled to speke or treate of peace betwene that one lorde and that other, and yf any good thynge were dyuysed for the hurte of theyr enymyes / anone the Danys were warned therof by some of the same counsayll. wherof were suspected Elfricus and Edricus. And to this sorowe was ioyned hunger and penury amonges the commons, that eueryche of theym was constrayned to plucke and stele from other / so that what by the pyllage of the Danys, and inwarde theuys and brybours, this lande was broughte in great mysery and myschefe.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXCVIII. CHAPITER.
                     EGelredus then wrapped in misery / lefte not to gader of hys subiectes what he myght, as well by vnlaufull meanes as otherwyse. For as sayth Ranulfe myne authour / he wold for fayned or small causes, dysheryte mē of theyr possessyōs / &amp; after cause men to redeme theyr owne for great summes of money. And ouer that he walowed in lechery, gyuyng hym to all vycyous and incontynent lyfe of his body. By whych vngracyous meanes, he brought this land in such ruyne, that what he myght not helpe by strēgth, he warred wyth money. So yt from the fyrst entre of the Danys as testyfyeth Policronica in the .xviii. chapyter of his .vi. boke, &amp; also Guydo wyth other authours / that from the fyrst trybute of .x. thou sande pounde, he broughte yt at the laste in processe of .v. or .vi. yeres to xl. thousande pounde. The whyche yerely durynge his lyfe and after, to the commynge of saynte Edwarde, was leuyed of his subiectes / and named for the contynuance therof Dane gelt. whyche is or was to meane money payde to the Danys, or shortly, Dane money.
                     In this tyme as yt were about the xv. yere of his reygne, dyed saynt Oswalde the archbyshoppe of Caunterbury. And soone after dyed Ethelgina the quene. And the body of saynte Cuthbert was translated from holy ylande to Durham / in the whyche yle he helde anankers lyfe, as yt is before shewyd in the storye of Cadwalader.
                     
                        Thus contynuynge this lande vnder the greuous tribute of the Danys, and also by susteynynge of many villanyes and iniuryes by the Englyshe men of the sayde Danys, as after somdele shall appere / this Egelredus by counsayll of his famylyers about the .xxi. yere of hys reygn / maryed Emma ye doughter of Rychard duke of Normandy, before mynded in the storye of Lewys the .v. and Lothayre hys sonne kynges of Fraūce. The whyche Rycharde was the thyrde duke of Normandy, and the fyrste that name / and also was surnamed Rycharde wythoute fere or the hardy / as more of hym shall be shewyd in the storye of the .vi. Lewis kynge of Fraunce.
                     By reason of maryenge of this Emma, whych in ye Frenche cronycle is named the flowre of Normandye / thys Egelredus was greatly enhaū
                        ced in hys owne mynde. By presumpcyon wherof he sent into all good burghes, cytyes, and townes of his lande, secrete and strayte commyssyons / chargynge the rulers that vppon a certayne day, that is to say vppon the daye of saynte Bryce at an houre assygned in euery place of hys lande, the Danys shulde be sodeynly slayne. And so yt was done.
                     And as the cōmon fame telleth, yt this murder beganne at a lytell towne in Hertefordeshyre, wythin xxiiii. myles of London called welewyn̄ or welwyn̄. For the whyche dedeyt toke fyrst that name / as who wolde wene, that the wele of the coū
                        trey was there fyrste wonne. But who that well cōsydereth the sequell of thys storye / shall fynde lytell wynnynge or weale ensuyenge of thys dede.
                     But or I procede further / here I wyll touche somewhat of the pryde and abusyō of ye Danis, that they exercysed in Englande, in some parte therof, as I haue sene in an olde cronycle, wherof the authoure ys vnknowen. There it is shewyd, that the Danys by strength caused husbande men to ere and sowe the lande, and do all other vyle laboure that belonged to husbandrye / and the Dane helde hys wyfe at hys pleasure, with doughter and seruaunt. And when the husbandeman came home / he shulde scantly haue of hys owne as seruaūtes had, so that the Dane had all hys commaundement, and ete and dranke hys fyll of the beste / whē the owner hadde scantely hys fyll of the worste. And ouer that the comon people were so of theym oppressyd / that for fere and drede, they called theym in euery suche house as they hadde rule of, Lorde Dane.
                     But in processe of tyme, after the Danys were voyded the lande / thys worde Lord Dane, was in derysyon and despyte of the Danys, turned by the Englyshemen into a name of opprobrye and called Lurdayne / whyche to our dayes ys not forgotten. But when one Englyshemā woll rebuke an other / he woll for the more rebuke call hym Lurdayn.
                     Then to retourne to our fyrste mater. Treuthe yt is that when the Danys were thus murdred thorugh Englande / tydynges therof sprange into Denmarke. whyche kyndeled in theym suche a fury / that the kyng therof named Swanus, assembled shortely a great hoste and nauye of Danys, and in shorte processe after landed in Cornewayll. And by treason of a Norman named Hugh, whyche by fauoure of the quene Emma was made erle of Deuenshyre / the sayd Swanus toke Exetour, and after bette downe the wallys.
                     Then he entred further into the lande. In whyche season the kynge

sent vnto Edricꝰ / chargyng hym to assemble the weste Saxons, and to wythstande the further entre of the Danys. The whyche accordynge to his commyssyon assembled the weste Saxōs / and made good contenaūce to wythstand the sayd enymyes. But when the hostes shulde ioyne / were it for fere or for treason, he fayned hym syke and fled from hys people. The whych for lacke of an hed were fayn to gyue backe / to theyr hurte, and to theyr enimyes great auauntage and comforte.
                     wherfore the Danys resorted then to wylton̄ and Shyrborn̄ / and anon spoyled both those townes, and there refresshed theym. But for Swanus had wittynge that the kynge was cō
                        myng towarde hym wyth the power of his lande / he therfore departed thens and retourned wyth great pyllage to his shyppes / &amp; sayled aboute the lande, and lastely landed in Norfolke. where he wastynge and spoylynge the countrey / came in processe vnto the cytye of Norwyche and robbed and spoyled yt / and after yode to Thetforde, and dyd lykewise to that towne, and fyred yt and destroyed ye countrey nere there about.
                     But soone after a noble man of that countrey called duke Uskatell mette wyth the hoste of Danys, and gaue vnto them an hard and sharpe batayll / and slewe many of the enymyes and put them backe. For this, and for hūger that then assailed this lande / Swanus returned ofte vnto his shyppes, &amp; departed agayne into Denmarke, &amp; taryed there all ye wynter folowynge. In whyche season he made great prouysyon to reenter the lande of Englande.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXCIX. CHAPITER.
                     ABout the .xxvi. yere of the reygne of Egelredus the forenamed Swanus with a stronge army, landed at Sandwyche / and spoyled all the coūtrey nere vnto the see syde, and rested hym there tyll he harde of an armye cōmynge agayn hym. And when he was ware therof, he retourned to his shyppes agayne / and herynge the kyng was farre westward, he landed in Sussex, and spoyled yt wonder sore. And when he there was warned of the cōmynge of a batayll of Englyshemen, anon he toke shyppynge agayne. So that when the englyshemen wende to haue met wyth them in one coste / then wolde they sodaynly lande in a nother. And when ye kyng prouyded to mete wyth thē vppon the see / other they wold fayne to flee, or ellys they shulde wyth gyftes blynde the admyrall of the kynges nauy.
                     By whyche subtylytye and crafty meanes, they weryed and tyred the hoste of Englyshmē. And where euer they went / they slew, brent, and robbed wythout compassyon and pytye. The kynge then beyng at Shrewesbury, &amp; herynge of the great sleyght and cruelty of the Danys / called his counsayll to rede what were beste to be done for ye defence of his enmyes. where it was concluded, that ye kyng to haue peace with the Danys, shuld pay vnto them .xxx. thousande poūd. But whyle this was in doynge, the Danys destroyed a grete part of Baroke or Barkshyre.
                     when this peace was thus made / Swanus wyth his company retourned into Denmarke. And ye yere folowynge / the kynge made Edricus forenamed duke of Mercia. Thys Edricus was of lowe byrth, ryche, of tunge false, and subtyll of wyt, softe and eloquēt of speche, vntrusty and false of thoughte and promyse / as of hym somdeale before is shewyd, and after more shall appere.
                     
                        In the .xxvii. yere of Egelredus / a prynce of Danys named Turkyllus landed in Kent. The whyche so greuously warred in that coūtrey / that the Kentyshemen were fayn to make theyr peace, and so departed.
                     And yet the persecucyon of Danys seased not. For in one countre of Englande or other / they euer in whylys robbed &amp; pilled the Englishmen. So yt all the coūtrey a longe the coste, frō the Northe parte of Englande vnto the yle of wyghte / was by theym destroyed or hugely sette a backe. And when the kynge entended to make prouysyon for to wythstande theym / euer Edricus wolde counsayll hym to the contrarye / shewynge hym that he shulde spende hys treasour &amp; trauayle his people in vayne. By mean wherof the Danys entred .l. myles wythin the lande / and brent and robbed by dyuers tymes many vylages &amp; townes. So that they encreased &amp; waxed passynge ryche / and the Enlyshemen nedy, bare, &amp; poore. Thus contynuynge this mysery / Swanus or after the englyshe Swayne then beyng in Denmarke, and heryng of the encreace of his people within Englande / repented hym of his former couenauntes, and thought yt the hole domynyon of Englād shulde belong to hym of ryght. For the whyche he prepared his armye &amp; nauy in moste defensyble wyse / and sped hym into England, &amp; to the ryuer of Humber, and landed in Northumberlande.
                     where the erle or ruler of that countrey wyth all the rulers of the same, sware feaute vnto the sayde Swanus, and promysed to kepe that countrey vnto hys vse. And when he had done hys wyll in that coste / he entred agayne the water, and by the ryuer of Trent he passed to Gaynysburghe, and so by North watlyngstrete / and subdued the inhabytauntes of that coūtrey, and forced theym to gyue vnto hym pledges. whyche pledges, wyth also his nauy / he betoke vnto Canutus his sonne, whyle, he wente farther into the lande. And that done, he wyth his▪ people kepte on his iourney tyl he▪ came into Mercia, kyllynge and slayeng the men of that prouynce / And reserued the women to vnclene lyuynge, as well the relygyous as other / and toke by strength wynchester and Oxenford, and dyd in them what he lyked.
                     And after he hadde thus passed the lande / he drewe the nexte waye towarde London. But in passynge the ryuer of Thames he loste some parte of hys people / other for lacke of a brydge or for ieopardynge theyr passage vnauysely. And so in processe he came vnto London / where at that tyme kynge Egelredus was. wherfore Swanus lefte the cytye, and drewe into Kente, and so towarde Caunterbury wythoute lette, weldynge the countrey at hys wyll / and lastely beseged that cytye. The whyche manfully defended theyr enymyes by the space of .xx. dayes. whyche syege beganne vpon the day of saynte Mathewe in the moneth of September, and endured as is aboue sayde / and then taken by the treason of a deken named Almaricus / the whyche beforetyme blessed Elphegus then archebyshop of that see, hadde preserued from deth.
                     Then the Danys fyred the cytye when they before had spoyled it / and toke the archebyshop and put him in strayte pryson. And the monkes of saynt Augustynes abbey they tythed that is to meane they slew .ix. by cruel torment, and the tenth they kepte a lyue / the whych after was solde and sette to all seruyle laboure. And as wytnessyth Antoninus or Uyncent hystoryall / they slewe and broughte

in seruage ouer the summe of .ix. hundred persones of relygyon / they slew of men, women, &amp; chyldren, beyonde the nōber of .viii. thousand. As with myche more cruelty yt is shewyd, in the .vii. chapyter of the .xvi. tytle of the worke of the sayde Antoninus. And fynally for this blessed man Elphegus wolde not condescende to gyue vnto them as sayth Policronica .iii. thousande pounde / after they had kept hym in harde pryson by the space of .vii. monethes, vppon an Ester euē they after many vylanyes to hym done at Grenewyche wythin thre myles of London, they stoned hym to deth. where he lay in the feld vnburyed a certayne of tyme / and after caryed to London, and buryed reuerētly in the chyrch of saynt Paule. But afterward in tyme of Canutus, he was taken vp agayne and caryed to his owne chyrche. Of this blyssed Elphegus Antoninus and also Policronicon shewen many vertues and myracles / the whyche I passe ouer for lengthynge of the tyme.
                  
                  
                     THE .CC. CHAPITER.
                     IN this pastyme, kynge Egelredus ferynge the ende of thys persecucyon / sent Emma the quene wyth her two sonnes Alphrede and Edwarde, vnto Rycharde the second of ye name, then fourth duke of Normandy, whych was brother vnto the sayde Emma / wyth whome also he sent the byshoppe of London.
                     About the .xxxiiii. yere of the reygne of Egelredus / the Danis when they hadde wonne a great part of the coū
                        trey of westsaxon, retorned agayn towarde London. wherof herynge the Londoners sent vnto theym certayn gyftes and pledges.
                     In all thys season myne authoure maketh no mynde, that euer the king gaue vnto the Denys any notable batayll / but kepte hym in holdes or places, for his owne sauegarde, and lytell fruyte or profyte to his lande. At the laste he was chaced vnto the yle of wyghte / where wyth a secrete companye, he helde a great parte of the wynter / and fynally wythout catall or comforte, sayled ouer to hys wyfe into Normādy / and there held hym a certayne of tyme.
                     whan Swanus was ascertayned of the departynge of Egelredus out of the lande, he was enflamed wyth excedynge pryde / so that he arrered excedynge imposycyons of the people, and greued them wonderfully. And amonges other of his tyrānyes he asked a great summe of money of saynt Edmundes landes. whych the rulers denayed / for so myche as they claymed to be free of all kynges trybute. For thys he entred the terytory of saynte Edmunde, and wasted and spoyled the countrey / and ouer that despysed that holy martyr, wyth manassyng of the place of his sepulture. wherfore the men of that countrey ferynge this tyraunt, gaue them to fastynge and prayer / so that shortly after he was stycked in an euenynge amonges his knyghtes, with ye sword of saynte Edmunde in the towne of Shetforde as sayth Guydo / but after Policronicon &amp; other in the town of Gaynesborugh. where he dyed wyth yellynge and cryenge the thyrd daye after.
                     In fere wherof, Canutus hys son after that he was kynge, closed in ye land of that holy martyr with a depe dyche / and graunted to the inhabytauntes therof great fredam, &amp; quyt them of all kyngly taske or trybute. And after buylded a chyrch ouer the place of his sepulture / and ordeyned there an house of munkes, &amp; endued them wyth fayre possessyons. And after

yt was vsed that kynges of England when they were crowned, sent for an offerynge theyr crownes vnto saynte Edmundes shryne / and redemed them aftewardes wyth a condygne pryce.
                     when Egelredus hadde wrytynge of the deth of Swanus / by procurement of his frendes / he made meanes to retourne to hys owne. By whose meanes he was sent for, wyth condycyon that he shulde refourme his olde condycyons. Ad for perfourmaūce of the same, he sent his son Edwarde into Englande before hym. And in the lent folowynge the kyng came hym selfe, and wyth his people sped hym towarde Lyndesey. where Canutus was at that tyme resseaūt, not prouyded of the kynges so hasty commynge.
                     wherfore he beynge not purueyed to wythstande the kynge, fledde into Sandewyche in Kente. And for he there proued suche persones as before tyme his fader and he hadde taken pledges of, &amp; fande them not perseueraunt in theyr ꝓmisses / he made to be cutte of all the noses and hādes of the sayd Englyshe people, and sayled into Denmarke when he had do / and retourned the nexte yere wyth a great nauy, and sayled about ye land, and toke prayes in the South countrey. wherof the kynges eldest sonne named Edmunde, made prouysyon wyth ye ayde of Edricus to go agayn hym. But when he shulde haue met with Edricꝰ at a place assigned &amp; his host, he was of hym dysceyued / wherfore he was compelled to gyue place to his enymyes. And as yt was after knowen, the sayde Edricus had promysed his fauour and ayde vnto the sayde Canutus.
                     By reason wherof Canutus entred the countre of west Saxon / and forsed them to swere to him feauty, and to gyue vnto him pledges / and other countreys adioynyng dyd the same.
                     In this seasan Egelredus beyng at London, was taken wyth a greuous sykenes &amp; dyed / and was there buryed in the chyrch of saynt Paule, where at this day in ye North yle behynde the quere, apperyth in the wal a token of hys sepulture / whyche reygned, or as say Policronicon &amp; other, beseged Englande, by the terme of xxxvi. yeres full / leuynge after hym a sonne named Edmunde Iron syde ouer Alphrede and Edwarde sonnes of Emma.
                  
                  
                     Francia. THE .CCI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        LEwys the .vi. of that name &amp; son of Lothayre / began hys reygne ouer Fraunce, in the yere of our lordes incarnacyon ix. hundred and lxxxvi / and the .v. yere of Egelredus than kyng of England. Of y• whiche other for hys youth or for the shortnesse of hys reygne, lytell of hys dedes is laft in memory / excepte that ye Frenche boke wytnessyth, that for he hadde none issue, and Hugh Capet before in the story of Lothayre mynded, was hys famylyer and chyefe coūsayler / he shuld therfore ordeyne and admytte the sayd Hugh for hys heyre. But more verely as before is touched in the aboue named story, &amp; in the ende therof, thys Hugh was stronge and myghty, and in the later dayes of Lothayre coueted the rule of the lande. wherfore after the deth of this Lewys, for so mych as he laft no chyld after hym / he than hauyng ye chyefe rule of Fraunce, by strength and power made hym selfe kynge.
                     
                        But for I promysed in the story of Egelredus, somwhat to shewe of Rycharde the fyrst of that name and thyrde duke of Normandye / I shall somdele length thys story wyth the story of the sayd Rycharde. Thys Rycharde as afferme all wryters, was named Rychard wythout fere. And for thys cause that foloweth, as testyfyeth the Frenche boke. He vsed mych to byd hys bedys for all crystē soules. And vpon a nyght whan he had longe watched / he entred a chyrche, where stode a corps vnburyed &amp; no man watchynge it. And whyle he sayd hys orysons for that soule and other / he layed hys gloues vppon a deske by hym. And whan he had ended hys deuocyons, he went out of ye chyrche for gettynge hys gloues behynde. But shortly after he remembred hym of them / and retorned towarde the chyrche for to fetche hys sayd glouys. whan he came at the chyrch dore / he founde ye corps there standynge, wyth hys armes spradde abrode, and makynge greate noyse and crye. wherfore the duke made ye sygne of ye crosse in hys forehed, and coniured the corps that he shulde reste, but all was in vayne. wherof the duke drewe hys sword and stroke at the corps, and to hys thynkyng parted hym in two peces. And that done entred the chyrche, fet hys glouys, &amp; so departed. And for this chaunce he ordeyned after thorough hys realme that a corps shulde be watched the fyrste nyght or lenger, as men hadde deuocyon. which gyse was somtyme vsed in Englande, and begon of the Normans as men may coniecture, after they had fyrste conquered thys lande.
                     Polycronycon sheweth in the .vii. chapyter of hys .vi. boke, that thys duke Rycharde dremed on a nyght that a monke of the house of saynte Audoenus in Roan, as he went towarde hys lemman by nyght / fyll besyde a brydge and was drowned. whose soule after was in stryfe bytwene an angell and a fende. The whyche after a longe stryfe / condescended to put the iudgement in duke Rycharde. Than the duke gaue sentence, that the soule shuld be restored agayne to the body / and then ye body to be set vppon ye brydge that before he was fallen fro. And yf he than went to hys lemman he shuld be the fendes / and yf nat, he shulde than be saued. And whan thys sentence was put in execucyon, the monke fledde vnto the chyrche therby. Uppon the morne whan the duke awoke, &amp; called thys vysyon to hys memory / to knowe the certaynte therof, he went vnto the sayd chyrche, and fande the monke there hys clothes yet wete / &amp; after went to the abbot of that place, and tolde to hym all thys dede, aduertysynge hym to take better ouersyght of hys flocke.
                     To these narracyons the herers may gyue credence as them lyketh. For they be nother in the pystle nor yet in the gospell. All be it Antoninꝰ archbysshop of Florence, whan he reherseth any lyke narracyons, whych he thynketh somwhat doutefull / he ioyneth these wordes and sayth, piū
                        est credere. The thyrde narracyon is tolde of thys duke / whych by all presumpcyon was regestred of some women scrybe. Thys duke wyth Gunnore hys wyfe, lyued longe whyle a dyshonest lyfe, and contrary to the lawes of the chyrch. wherof his people murmured sore / so that at length by the holsome doctryne of some of hys clerkes or spyrytuall men, he maryed her to hys lawfull wyfe. The fyrste nyght after ye weddynge / were it in game or otherwyse, the duchesse torned her buttocke in ye dukes lappe as

she before tyme hadde neuer done. whan the duke frayned the cause of her so doyng / for now (sayd she) may I do what me lyketh / where before I myghte do but what you lyked. Upon thys Gunnore he gate besyde other chylder, Emma that was the wyfe of Egelredꝰ as before ye haue harde / and dyed whan he had ruled Normandy by the terme of .lii. yeres.
                     Than to retourne to the .vi. Lewys kyng of Fraunce, from whome we haue made a longe dygressyon / as wytnesseth mayster Gagwyne he dyed in the yere of our lorde .ix. hundred .lxxxix, whē he had reygned. iii. yeres / and was buryed at Cōpayne.
                     ye shall vnderstande that this Lewys was the last kynge of the blode of Pepyn. And for I promysed before to shewe the dyscent of the sayde Pepyn, to the ende that ye maye the better know thys story / and also to knowe the kynges of Fraunce from the kynges of Germany, which both discended of thys Pepyn: hereafter I shall more clerely set it out in braū
                        ches. But fyrste I woll expresse the kynges of Fraunce as they reygned lynially / and ioyne to eyther of them the terme that he reygned, that there by it maye appere howe longe thys blode continued in ye house of Fraunce, or it were empeched by Hugh Capet, as after appereth.

                     THE .CCII. CHAPITER.
                     HUgh the sonne of Robert the tyraunt, descended of Hugh legraunde / beganne to take the rule, or to vsurpe the crowne of Fraunce, in the yere of our lorde .ix. hundred and .lxxxix / and the .viii. yere of Egelredus than kynge of Englande.
                     Thys as wytnessyth the Frenche Cronycle was erle of Parys, and marshall of Fraunce. And as sayth Antoninus, he maryed one of the doughters of Edwarde the elder. Thys also was named Capet, for so myche as in hys youth / he vsed in game to laye asyde hys felowes hodes. In whose begynnyng / Charlys that was the brother to Lothayre, and vncle vnto Lewys the .vi. laste kynge, herynge of the deth of hys neuewe Lewys wythout issue / as nexte heyre, wyth ayde of some lordes of Fraunce, and also of Loreyn, the whyche than he was lorde of, gadered an army and entred Fraunce / and than came to the cytye of Laone. wythin whyche cytye / he wyth hys wyfe and people, by the treason of the bysshoppe of the same cytye, was taken and delyuered wyth hys wyfe and chylder into the handes of hys enemyes / the whyche sent them to Orleaunce there sauely to be kept.
                     Than thys Hugh was crowned in the cytye of Rayns / and welded the lande wyth more suerty. How be it the erle of Flaunders named Arnulphus or Arnolde before spoken of, wolde not be vnder hys obedyence. wherfore thys Hugh assembled hys kynghtes / and by hys strength toke from hym the coutre of Artoys, wyth many stronge holdes and castels / and lastly forced the sayd Arnolde to fle into Normandy, to aske ayde of Richarde the fyrste of that name, before spoken of in the story of the .vi. Lewys. By whose meanes after some wryters / wyllyam Longa Spata fader to ye sayd duke Richarde was slayne. But that not wythstandynge, by frendshyp of the sayde duke Richarde, thys Arnolde was reconcyled vnto the kynge, and contynued after as hys subiecte.
                     In the cytye of Rayns was arch bysshoppe at thys daye a noble prelate named Arnolde, sonne of baste of Lothayre, and neuewe to Charlys than prysoner, as before is touched. The whyche for malyce that the kynge bare vnto hym, for cause of the forenamed Charlys / called a counsayle of the clergy of hys lande, and layde agayne hym suche obieccyons, that he by theyr assent was putte from that benefyce, and sente hym to Orlyaunce there also to be kepte in pryson. And set in hys place one Gylberte, or after the Frenche boke Gerbres, a connynge man in phylosophy / whiche had before tyme ben tutor or mayster to Robert sonne of the sayde Hugh. But after .iii. yeres / pope Iohn̄ the .xvi. of that name sent downe hys maundement vnto Guyan archebysshop of Sens / chargynge hym that he sholde remoue ye sayde Gerbers, and restore the sayde Arnolde to hys proper see. whyche was done shortely after / and ye sayde Gerbers was after this preferred by one of the Othons emperour vnto ye chyrche of Rauenne, and contynued there tyll the deth of the .xvii. Iohn̄. After whose deth he was electe pope of Rome / and was named the secōde Siluester, &amp; lyued as pope .iiii. yeres
                     Than it followeth in the story / whan thys Hugh had reygned full viii. yeares and more, he dyed in the yere of our lorde .ix. hundred .xciii. and was buryed at saynte Denys leuynge after hym a sonne named Robert.
                  
                  
                     
                     THE .CCIII. CHAPITER.
                     RObert the sonne of Hugh Capet, beganne his reygn, in the yere of our lord .ix. hundred &amp; .xcviii / and the .xvii. yere of Egelredus then kynge of Englande.
                     This was cōnynge in many scyences, and a man of good maner &amp; vertue. He made dyuers hymnes, sequences, &amp; respondes / as O Iuda et Hierusulem, O cōstantia martyrum, As sit nobis scti spūs gratia, or more cō
                        gruely, Sancti spiritus assit nobis gratia, wyth dyuers other.
                     In ye beginnyng of his reygn / while Bowcharde erle of Meleon̄ was at the kynges court, Galtyer or walter a knyghte and seruaunt of the sayde Bowcharde, to whom the sayd Bowcharde hadde delyuered his castell of Meleon̄ to kepe in his absence / for great gyftes the sayde walter hadde delyuered the sayde castell unto Eudo erle of Carnotens. wherfore the kyng at the request of the sayd Bowcharde, sente streyghte commaundement vnto the sayd Eudo / chargyng hym in all goodly wyse to restore the sayde castell vnto Bowcharde. The whyche commaundement he vtterly refused to obey. For ye whych ȳe kyng beyng so amoued / sent for Rycharde the seconde of that name, then .iiii. duke of Normandy / and wyth theyr both armyes besyeged the castell vppon euery parte, and at length wan yt and toke the sayd walter wythin the same / whom the kinge for his vntrouthe commaunded soone after to be hanged vppon a gybet, and the castell to be restored vnto ye forenamed Bowcharde / and after returned euery man to his owne.
                     In the tyme of the reygne of thys Robert / dyd Henry then duke of Burgoyne. The whyche for lacke of yssue of his body, bequethed his dukedome vnto kynge Robert. But the Burgonyons wythstode that legacy / and drewe to theym for an hed &amp; captayne Lawdry erle of Neuers / and wyth hym helde by strength or for a strength the cytye of Anxerre. wherof herynge kyng Robert / sente for the foresayde duke of Normandye, and so spedde theym towarde Burgoyne and besyeged the forsayd cytye. But at length ye cytye was yolden / and Lawdry put at the kynges grace. And that done, the kyng with his hoste besyeged a nother stronge cytye called Aualon̄ / and not wythout great daunger wanne yt also at length / and after receyued the countrey wyth dew obeysaunce, and ordered yt at hys own pleasure, and so retourned into Fraunce.
                     Arnolde erle of Sens vsed great tyranny amonges the byshoppes &amp; mynysters of the chyrche. wherfore Leophricus byshop of that see, thorough the ayde and counsayll of Regnalde byshop of Parys / put oute the sayde Arnolde, and delyuered the cytye vnto kynge Robert. But the brother of the sayde Arnolde with a certayne of his knyghtes, fled to the castell and yt helde wyth strength. wherfore the kynge layde syege to the sayd castel, and at length wan yt / and toke the brother of Arnolde named Fromōde and sent him to Orleaūce there to be prisoned, where he dyed shortly after
                     This Robert as saith the frenche boke buylded fyrst ye castell of Moūt fort. He founded also dyuers monasteryes and tēples / and at Orleaūce the tēple of saint Anyan̄ / at Stamps a chyrche of our lady / &amp; dyuers other in dyuers places of hys realme. And he endowed the chyrche of saynte Denys wyth many great lyberties / and hadde especyall deuocyon to saynte ypolyte ouer all other sayntes.
                     It is radde of this kynge Robert,

that vppon a season when he hadde longe whyLe lyen at the syege of a castell nere vnto Orleaunce, and sawe yt was defuse to wynne be strength / he vpon ye daye of saynt Anyan yode vnto Orleaunce, &amp; there in the quere bare a cope, and dyd helpe to synge the dyuyne seruyce. And after when he was in his deuocyōs in the masse whyle / when the preste was at the cō
                        secracion and sayd thryse Agnꝰ dei, the walles of the castell fyll wythout stroke of gunne or other engyne, and hys enemyes submytted them to hys grace. Many vertues myght I shew more of this vertuous price / y• which I passe ouer for length of the tyme / and conclude thus, that when he had reygned after moste accorde of wryters, and ruled hys lande nobly .xxx. yeres, he dyed, and was buryed in the house of saynte Denys / leuynge after him of his fyrst wife Constaūce a sonne named Henry, and one other named Robert / and of hys seconde wyfe .ii. sonnes named Symonde and Almaryche. But yt shulde seme by the sequele of the next storye, that Constaunce shuld be laste wyfe, &amp; the other the fyrste / and deuorced from hym for some cause, so that her chyldern shulde not be legyttymat / all be yt the authoure of this maketh no mencyon.
                  
                  
                     Anglia. THE .CCIIII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        EDmunde Ironsyde the sonne of Egelredus, and also Canutus ye sonne of Swanus kyng of Dē
                        marke / beganne to rule the Englyshemen, in the yere of our lorde a thousande &amp; .xvi / and the .xix. yere of Robert then kynge of Fraunce. For ye Londoners wyth assystēce of some of ye lordes of England fauoured Edmūde. But the more party of the lordes fauoured Canutꝰ / &amp; specylly the spiritualtye, ye before tyme had sworne feauty to hys father. And he then beynge at Southampton̄ / swore to them to be vnto them a good &amp; trewe iustice, and to entreate the people soberly and ryghte wysely. Then Edmunde beynge of the archbyshop of yorke crowned at Lōdon, and the solemnyte fynyshed and ended / he sped hym into westsaxon, and subdued yt countrey. In whych tyme Canutus, whych in ye englyshe storye is called Knough / drewe wyth hys people to Lōdon, and wold there haue entred. But that was hym forboden of the Londoners. For the whiche he layde hys ordynaunce aboute the cytye, en tendynge to haue entred perforce. But it was not long or he was fayne to breke his syege &amp; to depart thens.
                     when Canutus was put of from London / he drewe westwarde, and mette in processe wyth Edmunde in Dorsetshyre besyde Gyllyngham / where betwene theym was foughten a stronge and cruell batayll. But in the ende Canutus was ouercomen &amp; compelled to forsake the felde. After thys they mette agayne in worceter shyre / where they fought a more strō
                        ger batayll. For this was so strongly bydden by, ye men coude not iudge whych parte had the better, or which the worse. But as wytnessyth Policronica eyther of theym departed frō other, eyther for werynesse of fyghte or for lak of the daye.
                     But vppon the morne folowynge both hostes ioyned agayne, &amp; fought egerly. Contynuynge whych fyght Edricus espyenge Edmunde to be at auauntage of wynnynge of the feld, sodaynly pyght a dede mannys hed

vppon a spere hed, and cryed to the hoste of Englyssmen, fle fle ye Englyshemen &amp; saue your selfe / loo here is the hedde of Edmūde your kyng. But Edmunde therof beynge warned / spedde hym towarde that parte of the felde, and behaued hym so comfortably amonges hys men, that by hys knyghtely courage hys people recoueryd that they before had loste / and cōtynued the batayll tyll nyght, in suche wyse that he hadde rather the better then the worse / and caused Canutus to refuse that countrey, and to retourne towarde London agayne. Then Edmunde beyng aduertysed that Canutus was retourned towarde London / he folowed hym and passed the ryuer of Thamys, and delyueryd the cytye from daunger of the Danys / and afterwarde encountred the Danys at a place called Brentforde, where with them he had a cruell fyght / and scom fyted theym at length.
                     In thys passe tyme Emma ye wyfe of Egelredus, ferynge the fortune of the warre / sent her two sonnes Alphrede and Edwarde, vnto her brother Richarde the seconde of that name and fourth duke of Normandy.
                     But Edricus then, whyche as before is sayd, was euer subtyle of wyt, consyderynge the good fortune of Edmunde and hys knyghtely courage / thought that at length he shuld ouercome the Danys. wherfore to saue hys lande, and also to brynge aboute hys malycyouse treason / he sought the wayes and meanes howe he myght stande in hys grace and fauour. And at length obteyned his entente / and swore to hym to be hys trewe subiecte.
                     when kynge Edmunde had a season soiorned at Lōdon / he then made towarde the Danys that then were in Kent, and met wyth thē at a place called Okefforde or Otforde, &amp; there scomfyted them, and chasyd Canutꝰ to the yle of Shepey. And there Canutus toke shypyng / &amp; sayled about the land, &amp; entred lastely in ye coūtrey of Mercia &amp; spoyled a parte therof.
                     Then the two hostes met soone after at a place called Asshedown, where after longe fyghte Edricus wyth his retynew fledde to the comforte of the Danys. By meane wherof kyng Edmunde was put to the worse / for many noble men were slayne vppon his party. Amonges the whyche the byshop of Lyncoln̄ &amp; the abbot of Ramysey were two / that thyther were come to treate a peace betwene bothe prynces. But whē this was layde to ye charge of Edricꝰ / he by his vntrew meanes so excused hym, that no man myght charge hym with any defaut.
                     Thus contynuynge thys mortall warre betwyxte these two marcyall prynces, to the grete desolacyō &amp; mortalyte of the people / one of the knyghtes of the partye of Edmunde gatte hym to an hyghe place, where he myght be somwhat harde of ye hoste / and spake in thys wyse: Dayly we dye, and no man hath the vyctorye. For Edmunde may not be ouercome for his great strength / and Canutus may not be ouercome for fauoure of Fortune. what shall then be ye fruyte of thys cōtynuall stryfe? None other but when the knyghtes ben all slayn on eyther partyes / then the dukes compelled by nede shall accorde, or ellys they shall fyght alone wythout knyghtes. Then syn this shall be the ende / why do they not one of these two? If they accorde / why is not this kyngedome suffycynt for twayne, yt somtyme suffysed for .vii. If theyr couetyse of lordshyppes be so great, y• eyther hath indygnacyon to take and haue parte wyth other, or ellys that one to be vnder that other / then

lette them fyghte alone, that woll be the lordes alone left. If all mē fyght, all men be slayne / by meane wherof no men shall be left to be vnder theyr lordshyp or ledyng of dukes, nor yet to defende the kynge agayne stronge enymyes or nacyons.
                     These wordes thus spoken / were ryght wele alowed of both hostes. For as affermeth myne author / at this time a trewce was made betwen both prynces far a certayne tyme. After whych peace ended / were yt by occasyon of these wordes or otherwise, the sayde two dukes Edmunde and Canutus agreed to trye theyr quarelles betwene them two onely. And for thys was assygned by theyr both agrementes, a lytell yle called then Olney nere vnto Glouceter, or after some wryters named Olenege, bycleped wyth the water of Seuerne. In whyche place at the daye appoynted, the two chāpyons met wythoute company or assistence wythin ye sayd yle / the hostes of bothe partyes standynge wythoute the yle, and there abydynge the fortune of thys batayll. There eyther proued other fyrste wyth sharpe speres, and after wyth kene and cuttynge swordes. what shall I of thys make lenger proces / when eyther hadde other well proued and assayed, by receyuynge of harde and sore strokes / by the fyrste mocyon of Canutus, as moste wryters testyfyen, they lastely accorded and kyssed to gyther as louers, to the great comforte of bothe hostes. And shortely after by the aduyce of bothe theyr counsaylles, condescended vppon partycyon of the lande / whyche immedyately was done to bothe theyr agrementes, and loued after as two bretherne duryng theyr naturall lyues. But the serpent Idre of enuy and false conspyracye, which euer burnyd in the harte of Edricus was kyndeled so sore, that of pure force yt must breke out vpon a lyght flambe / so what he myghte not accomplyshe by his owne persone, he fulfylled by his sonne, as testyfyen dyuerse authours. For as affermeth Guydo / this sonne of Edricus away tynge his tyme, espyed when ye kyng was at the wyddraught to purge nature / and wyth a spere strake hym into the foundement and so into the bodye, wherof kynge Edmunde dyed shortly after at Oxen. The king thus beynge slayne / anon Edricus thynkynge therby to be greatly exalted, spedde hym in all haste vnto Canutus, and saluted hym as kynge / and shewed hym of thys treason onely for hys loue done. when Canutus hadde well vnderstandyng of ye confessyon of Edricus, he lyke a dyscrete and ryghtous prynce sayd vnto hym in thys wyse. For thou haste Edricus for the loue thou berest vnto me, slayne thyne naturall lorde, whyche I moste loued / I shall exalte thyne hed aboue al the lordes of England. And forthwyth commaunded hym to be taken, and hys hedde to be stryken of, and pyght on a spere hedde, and after sette vppon the higest gate of London. But Marianus the Scot telleth, that Edmunde dyed at London by naturall sekenesse, about the feste of saynt Andrewe. And the englyshe cronycle affermeth the forenamed treason / but by a nother maner of doynge. But howe so euer this noble prynce dyed / trouth yt is after agrement of moste wryters, yt he ended hys lyfe, when he hadde reygned one yere &amp; more, as myche as from the moneth of Iune vnto the ende of Nouember / and was buryed at Glastenbury by hys graundfather Edgare. Policronica sheweth in the .xviii. chapyter of hys .vi. boke, that Canutus after the deth

of Edmunde gave vnto Edricus the lordeshyppe of Mercia / and by hys counsayll exyled the brother of Edmunde called the kynge of chorles / and thorough his con̄sayle executed many cruell dedes. Of this Edmūde remayned two sonnes, that is to wyt Edmunde and Edwarde.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCV. CHAPITER.
                     CAnutus or Knougth after the Englyshe cronycle, sonne of Swanus as before is touched, and yonger brother as appereth by ye story folowynge / began his domynyon alone ouer Englande, in the yere of our lorde a thousande &amp; .xix / and the xxi. yere of Robert then kyng of Fraū
                        ce. The whyche anon after the deth of Edmunde assembled a counsayll at London / where among other thynges in that coūsayll debated, a questyon was put, whether in the composicyon made betwene Edmunde and Canutus, any speciall remembraūce was made for the chyldren or brethern of Edmunde, for any partycyon of any parte of the lande.
                     wherunto yt was answered of the lordes naye. Affermyng farthermore wyth othe for the kynges pleasure, that they to the vttermoste of theyr powers wolde put of that blood of Edmunde in all that they myght By reason of whyche answere &amp; promyse / they thought many of them to haue standen in the great grace and fauoure of the kynge / but yt turned all otherwyse.
                     For many of them, or the more partye, such as Canutus apperceyued &amp; knewe, that they beforetyme were sworne to Edmunde and his heyres, &amp; also were natyue Englishe men / he mystrusted &amp; disdaned euer after. In so myche that some he exyled, &amp; some were slayn, and some by goddes punyshement dyed sodaynly.
                     But amonge all Edricus wyth his sugred wordes contynued in the kynges fauoure as sayth Marianus before mynded. By whose counsayll &amp; other / he shortely after outlawed the foresayde brother of Edmunde surnamed kynge Charlis, as before is touched. But he afterwarde was reconcyled to the kynges fauour, and lastely slayne of his owne seruaūtes.
                     Canutus also by the sayde counsayll, sent the .ii. sonnes of Edmūde, named as before is sayde Edmunde &amp; Edwarde, vnto his brother Swanus then kynge of Denmarke, to be slayne after the oppynyon of some wryters. But he abhorrynge that dede / sente theym to Salomon then kynge of Hungarye as wytnessyth Guydo and other. where in processe of tyme Edmunde dyed / and his brother Edwarde in tracte of tyme maryed Agatha the doughter of the .iiii. Henry then emperour of Almayne. Of the whyche Edwarde and Agatha procedyd Margarete that after was quene of Scotlande / and Crystyane that was a menchon, and a sonne named Edgar and surnamed Ethelynge.
                     Thys Edwarde of the cronycles of England is named Edwarde the outlawe / for so myche as he neuer returned into Englande as sayth the sayde englyshe cronycle, after hys fyrste exyle.
                     Then to returne vnto Canus / the whyche after some thynges orderyd in his lande, deuyded his sayd lande in foure partes. That is to meane the fyrst princypall which at those dayes was westsaxon, he helde vnder hys owne gydyng. Eestenglande, whych cōteyned Norff. &amp; Suff. he betoke to the rule of ye erle, Turkyllꝰ a Dane / of whome somwhat is in the .iii. chapyter of ye story of Egelredꝰ. Mercia

he betoke to the subtell erle Edricus. And the .iiii. Northumberlande, vnto a Dane named Hircius. But lyke as the man of Inde at no tyme chaū
                        ged his colour / so this Edricus chaū
                        ged neuer his fals maners. But not wythstandynge the great benefytes that he dayly receyued of his prynces / there as he to other hadde ben false and dysceyuable in dayes past, euen so nowe he demeaned hym agayne Canutus.
                     wherfore he beynge accused &amp; proued wyth defaute / was commaūded of the kyng to haue iudgement. The whyche was done immediatly / &amp; his hedde for dyuerse causes smyten of / and yt wyth the bodye for spyte caste into a fowle and fylthy place. But Ranulf sayth that he was slayne by the kynges agrement wythin his paleys at London / and his body wyth the hed throwne after into the towne dyche. Thus wyth shame he ended, that in falshode &amp; dyssymulacyō had contynued myche of his lyfe.
                     Aboute the .ix. yere of his reygne, Canutꝰ called a parliament at Oxenford / where amonges other thynges yt was enacted, that Englyshmen &amp; Danys shuld holde the lawes of Edgar lately kynge.
                     In this pastyme dyed Swanus brother to Canutus kynge of Denmarke wythout issue / wherfore that lande fyll to Canutus. For the which cause he wyth a stronge army sayled thyther to take the possessyon, and to set the countrey in an order / or after some wryters to apeas &amp; wythstande the wandelys, yt then had perced that lande and done therin myche harme. where Goodwyn̄ the erle, whose doughter Edwarde the confessour after maryed / wyth a certayne nomber of Englyshmen fyll vpon ye wandalys by nyght, &amp; dystressed theym in suche wyse, that Canutus had of them his pleasure. For this dede the kyng had erle Goodwyn̄ euer after in good fauoure, and loued Englyshmen more specyally. And when he was returned into Englande / he shortely after or before, maryed Emma the wyfe lately of Egelredus. Of the whych he receyued in processe of tyme a son &amp; named hym Hardicunitus, or after some Hardykynitus / &amp; after the Englyshe boke Hardyknough.
                     And aboute this tyme fyll voyde y• see of Lyndesser or Durham, to the whyche by dyuyne inspyracyon and knowlege receyued by a voyce from the tumbe of saynt Cuthbert / blessed Edmūde after thre yere of vacacyon was electe to that see. But ye shal vnderstande that thys was not saynte Edmunde of Ponteney. For he was archbyshoppe of Caunterbury in the dayes of Henry the thyrde.
                  
                  
                     THE .CXCVI. CHAPITER.
                     CAnutus about the .vii. yere of his reygne / by exhortacyon of Egelnothus then archbishop of Caūterbury, translated the body of saynt Elphegus late archbyshoppe of the sayd see, martyred by the Danys, as before is shewed in the seconde chapiter of the storye of Egelredus / and shryued hym in hys owne chyrche of Caunterbury foresayde.
                     In the tyme also of thys Canutus / aboute the .xvi. yere of hys reygne, the Scottes rebelled agayne hym. wherfore he with a great army entred Scotlande / &amp; at length ouercame the kynge of that lande named then Malcolyne, and brought them agayne to hys subieccyon, as is recorded in the bokes of Marianus the Scot. By reason of whych vyctory Canutus was then kynge of .iiii. kyngdoms / of England, of Scotlād of Denmarke, and Norwaye. Then

as wytnessyth dyuerse authours after he had betaken this lande of Englande to the gydynge of Leofricus Egelnothus, and other / he then returned into Denmarke. And from thēs he yode to Rome in the .xv. yere of his reygn, &amp; made there great offerynges to saynte Peter and Poule / &amp; redemed the scole of Saxons fre of all former trybute graunted, as before in the storyes of Iue and Offa and other kynges of Saxons is som deale more touched. whyche redempcyon of tribute as sayth Guydo, was called Rome Scot. But it shall seme in that sayenge some douteth / for so myche as at thys daye in dyuers places of Englād, as in Northamptonshyre and other, the peter pens are yet gaderyd. Canutus also after he had in Rome accomplyshed his purpose / he in hys returne towarde Englande executed wonderfull dedes of almes, in releuynge of the poore and other goftly workes / &amp; payde great good for raunsom of crysten prysoners / amonges other of his dedes, It is wytnessyd that he shulde agree with the pope that was called Benet the .viii. of that name, &amp; pay to hym certayne summes of money, that his archbyshoppes after yt daye myghte haue the pall wythoute payenge of money therfore.
                     And whē he was comen in the citye of Papia in Italy, in hys way home warde, he there brought the arme of saynte Augustyne the doctour for a hundred pounde of syluer and a talent of golde. And here is to be noted that there be thre maners of talētes. The fyrst and grettest is of y• weyght of .vi. score pounde weyghte / the seconde of the weyght of .lxxii pounde / and the thyrde and leest of .l. pounde weyght. Then yf we reken this talent with the leest / in a poūde of gold after troye weyght, is .xii. vuces, and in .l. pounde is .vi. hūdred vnces, and euery vnce of fyne golde is worth xl.s. By whyche reason this talent shulde be in value to the summe of xii. hundred pounde. This precyous relyque ye kyng gaue vnto his trusty frende Leofricus / ye whych he myche loued and trusted / and remayned at Couentre many yeres after.
                     whyle Canutus was occupyed in thys iourney / cōplaynt was brought vnto hym of some mysse demeanurs and rule, that were occupyed and exercysed in his absence wythin this realme. wherfore he wrote home letters to the lordes / chargynge theym straytely, that all such defautes were redressed agayne hys cōmyng home.
                     Thys kynge as wythnesseth Guydo was of great magnyfycence / and vsed suche iustyce and temperaunce, that in his dayes in the weste partes of the worlde, was no prynce of renowne as was Canutus. And ouer that he was gretly beloued &amp; dradde of hys subiectes.
                     In the tyme of this Canutus, as tessyfyeth Guillelmus de pontificibus / a munke of Glastēbury named Bryghtwolde, whyche was after bysshop of wylton, beynge in hys contemplacyon and prayer, bethoughte hym on the lynage of Englyshe kynges. And in that thought fyll into a slumber / in whyche tyme of his slepe he sawe saynte Peter the apostle standynge by hym, and holdynge in hys hande Edwarde the sonne of Egelredus which then was in Normandy / the whyche to his thynkynge, he saw saynte Peter saker ye sayde Edward as kynge of Englande. And shewed to hym farther how holy this Edwarde shulde be in hys lyuynge, and how he shuld reygne as kynge .xxiii. yeres. Then thys monke frayned saynt Peter of the ofsprynge of thys Edwarde, and who shulde be kynge

after hym. To the whyche questyon was answered by Peter, the kyngedome of Englyshemen is the kyngedome of god / wherfore the kynges therof shall stande at goddes puruyaunce. And also a nother doctour called Henry of Huntyngdon / shewyd that an holy man warned Englyshe men, y• a lorde whyche they thought nothynge vppon, shulde come out of Fraunce &amp; brynge them ryght lowe.
                     In the tyme also of thys Canutꝰ by agrement of many wryters fyll one thynge worthy mynde and memory. In a town of Saxony named Calbis, in ye dyocesys of Magburgh and parysshe of saynt Magii / xviii. men and .xv. women vppon the euen of the Natyuyte of our lorde began a daunce about the chyrche yarde of saynt Magu afore sayd / the person or other prestes beyng than at masse wythin ye same chyrche. which beyng troubled wyth the noyse of the mynstrellys, &amp; also the dynne of the sayde men and women / sent vnto them in monysshynge them to seace of that doynge. But all was in vayne / for they wolde not seace of theyr dysport for any commaūdement yt to thē was gyuen. wherwyth the preste beynge dyscontented, that they none other wyse reuerenced ye sacrament, noryed that solempne season / besought god and saynte Magii that they shulde contynue theyr daunce by the space of an hole yere. The whyche prayer was harde / in suche wyse that they contynued the same songe &amp; daunce tyll that daye twelue monethes, and neuer eate nor dranke nor rested thē in all ye season. And moreouer dewe nor rayne fyll vppon them in all that yere / nor garment nor no thyng that was about them was impayred shoo nor other. At the yeres ende / Horobertus archbysshop of that dyocesys came vnto ye sayde place and lowsed them of that bonde whych the preste had bounde them in / and before the awlter of the chyrche them reconsyled. Of the whyche a prestes doughter and two other dyed forth wyth / and the remenaunt yode to reste and slepte by the space of .iii. dayes and iii. nyghtes folowynge. where after some of them dyed / and suche as lyued fell lame of theyr lymmes. And one of the same .xviii. men beyng named Ubertus or Hupertus, wrote thys wonder wyth hys owne hande for a more recorde of the trowth.
                     Then let vs retorne to Canutus / of whom it is redde that after hys cōmyng from Rome, he beganne somdele to presume in pryde, &amp; set more by hym selfe than good wysdome wolde. In tyme of whyche exaltacyō of hys mynde / he went vnto the Tamys syde, and behelde howe the water swelled or flowed. And so standynge nere the water / the water touched hys fete. Than he charged the water that he shuld flowe no hygher and that in no wyse he shulde to wche hys lordes clothes. But the water kepte his course and wette at length the kynges thyes. wherewyth ye kyng abasshed sterte backe and sayde, all erthly kynges may know that theyr powers be vayne / and that none is worthy to haue the name of a kynge but he that hath all thynges subiecte to hys hestes, as here is shewed by worchynge of hys treature by thys water. And for thys as wytnesseth Polycronycon and other / he offered hys crowne to ye rode of wynchester, and neuer bare it vpon his hed after.
                     It is also wytnessed of the sayde authour / that Canutus maryed hys doughter hadde by hys laste wyfe, vnto Henry sonne of Conradus the emperour, the seconde of that name / as also it is testyfyed of the authour of Cronica cronicarum.
                     
                        And he repayred many monasteryes / and specyally suche as before tyme were hurte or throwne downe in the tyme of hys fathers persecucyon. And began and ended the monastery of saynt Edmundes Bury / &amp; endowed it wyth ryche possessyons as before is towched. And dyed fynally at Shaftesbury, and was buryed at wynchester, whan he hadde reygned .xix. yeres / leuyng after hym two sonnes of hys wyues / the eldest was named Harolde and the yonger Hardykynytus / the whyche lyuyng hys fader was made kynge of Denmarke.
                  
                  
                     Francia. THE .CCVII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        HEnry the sonne of Robert / begā hys domynyon ouer the French men, in the yere of our lord. M.xxix / and the .x. yere of Canutus than kynge of Englande. To the whyche Henry / Cōstantyne the moder was so vnkynde, that she by her meanes wolde haue preferred her yonger sonne Roberte duke of Burgoyne, to the rule of the lande before thys Henry / so that by her meanes, bothe cytyes and castels were wyth holden from hym, and was by her &amp; suche other as toke her parte so ouer lad, that he was forced to resorte to Robert than duke of Normandy, for to aske helpe of hym to wythstande hys enemyes.
                     ye shall vnderstande that this Robert was the .vi. duke of Normandy, and sonne of Richarde the seconde / and also father vnto wyllyā bastard that conquered Englande.
                     Thys Roberte was lyberall and noble of condycyon / but defamed of ye deth of hys elder brother Rychard the thyrde. For the whyche murder as wytnessyth dyuers authours / the vii. yere of hys dowchery he went to Iherusalem, and dyd in that pylgre mage many honourable and liberall actes / the whyche in good order ben remembred in the .xix. chapyter of the vi. boke of Polycronicon.
                     This Robert receyued kyng Henry wyth all honour, and gaue vnto hym greate and ryche gyftes, &amp; sent for hys frendes and knyghtes / so ye the kynge had by hys ayde a greate &amp; myghty hoste. And retorned agayn into Fraunce / and in short whyle after recouered from hys sayde moder bothe cytyes, townes, and castelles, that she and her fautours from hym wythhelde. And fynally agreed so wyth her / that he and she contynued frendes theyr lyfe tymes enduryng. After whyche accorde / about the .v. yere of hys reygne he made warre vppon Eudo erle of Champayne, &amp; vppon Baldewine erle of Flaūders / and in processe of tyme wan frō them certayne cytyes and castelles, the whyche Constance his moder hadde before tymes gyuen to them in tyme of dyscencyon.
                     In thys warre was slayne Eudo erle of Champayne. wherfore hys .ii. sonnes Stephen &amp; Thybaud maynteyned the warre agayne the kynge / but to theyr bothe harmes in ye ende. For Stephen loste therby the cytyes of Chartres and towers, and Thybaude ye cytyes of Troyes &amp; Maulx wyth other.
                     whan Henry hadde ended thys warre &amp; set hys lande in some quyetnesse / he thā buylded a monastery of saynt Martyne called Des Chāps besyde Parys, and set therin seculer prestes.
                     In thys passetyme Robert duke

of Normandy moued in conscyence to vysyte the holy sepulture of oure lorde, called before hym hys lordes of hys lande / wyllynge and cōmaundynge them to owe theyr trewe allegaunce vnto hys yonger sonne wyllyam, and to take hym for theyr lord and duke yf he retorne not agayne. And to thys / he caused to swere Robert than archbysshop of Roan, with the other of hys lordes / and after departed vppon the sayd iourney, and dyed in the cytye of Bethenia as he was cōmynge homewarde. wherof ye lordes of Normandy beynge assertayned, accepted the foresayde wyllyam to theyr lorde and souerayne.
                     Of thys wyllyams procreacyon / yt is wytnessed of Uyncent hystory all and other, that his father passynge by the cytye or towne of Faloys in Normandy, he sawe a company of maydens daunsynge by the strete. Amonges the whych was one of passynge beautye called Arlet, and doughter to a skynner. To ye which duke Robert caste vnlefull loue / in suche wyse yt he caused her to be broughte to his bed the nyght folowyng, and helde her to his concubyne a certayn of tyme after / &amp; begat on her this wyllyam. whē his moder was wyth him cōceyued / she dremed that her bowel lys were sprad ouer all Normandye and Englande. And when he was borne of his moders wombe / he fyll to the groūde, and closed his handes wyth powder of the flore or pauement. Therfore the mydwyfe made and exclamacyon, and sayd this chyld shall be a kynge.
                     Then yt foloweth / when thys wyllyam was thus admitted duke, some of his lordes by the meane of ye kyng of Fraūce, began to wythdraw them from hym. In so myche ye erle Gylbert to whome duke Robert had betaken hys ponge sonne to gyde was slayne, and other that were especyall frendes to the chylde. There was fyghtyng and manslaughter and the countrey fowle faren with, by reason of the opynyons that were amonges them selfe / wherof Guy a Burgoyn was one of the chefe causers. For he with his adherentes sayde alwayes; that they wolde haue no bastarde to be ruler of them.
                     This Guy as saith the frēche boke was nere kynnesman vnto ye yonge duke, descendyd of the doughter of the seconde Rycharde / and entended to haue ben duke hym selfe. For the which he ensensed ye kyng of Fraūce agayn hym in all that he myght / but at length duke wyllyam toke hym and put hym to deth.
                     Thus the Frenche kynge forgettynge ye kyndnesse shewyd to hym by duke Robert hys father, toke partye agayne hym to the vttermoste / and ordeyned hym .ii. hostes. wherof one he delyueryd to his brother Almaryk / and warned hym to eutre ye countrey of Caus / and he hym selfe ladde that other, and entred with it the coū
                        trey of Eurour.
                     But wyllyam not ferynge the kynges great power / beynge growen wele towarde mannes stature, lyke a luste yonge knyght made towarde the kynges brother / &amp; gaue to hym batayll, &amp; hym ouercame, and chased the Frenchemen to theyr great bylany. wherof heryng the Frenche kyng wyth his people spedde hym toward wyllyam to reuenge the shame done to his men. But in cōclusyon he wan there no honoure. Then peace was made betwene the kyng and ye duke / and the Frenche prysoners were delyueryd.
                     But this peace enduryed not long / for the Frēch kyng callynge to remē
                        braūce the losse of hys men at Mort mere or dede see, wyth other dysauauntages

by hym sustayned of the sayde duke wyllyam / called to hys ayde Geoffrey erle of Aungiers. And whan hys hoste was assembled / they entred ye prouynce of Normādy, &amp; cō
                        tynued theyr iourney tyll they came to an arme of the see, where the hoste shulde passe ouer.
                     Of thys new warre duke wyllyā beynge warned / in all haste assembled hys Normans and sped hym ye next waye to mete the Frenchemen. In thys meane whyle the Frenche kynge had passed the water wyth certayne of hys hoste, trustyng that the remenauaūt shulde haue folowed. But soone after the water flowed so faste that hys people myghte not passe. And in thys whyle came the duke and set vpon the kynges hoste, and bet theym downe cruelly / so that at length the kynge was compelled to flee, and loste a great nomber of his knyghtes, to consyder them ye were slayne wyth the other that were taken prysoners.
                     whan kynge Henry had well dysgested in hys mynde, the wrongfull trouble that he by enuyous persons hadde put the duke vnto, and remē
                        bred the yll expedycyon that he had in that warre / he recōsyled hym selfe, and made meanes that the duke and he myghte be agreed and accorded. The whyche by dyscrete solycytours was shortely after brought to good effecte / so that they contynued as frē
                        des durynge theyr lyues after.
                     Than Henry abstayned hym from all warre / &amp; vsed the reste of hys lyfe in peas and quyetnesse. Thys Henry had two wyues / and of the laste whyche was doughter to the kynge of Russy, he had .iii. sonnes / that is to say Phylyp, y• whych he made kyng of Fraunce by hys lyfe, Robert that was after duke of Burgoyne, and Hughe that was after named Hugh le graunde, and was fader to Raufe erle of Uermendoyse.
                     And in thys kynges dayes / Burgoyne that had ben vnder ye Frenche kynges obeysaunce ouer a hundred and .xxx. yeres, refused the Frenche kynge, aparte of them, &amp; torned vnto Conradus the seconde of that name than emperour. So that that parte whyche stretched to Champayne belonged to Fraunce / and that other parte whyche stretched toward Basaynz belonged to the Almayns.
                     And that yere that the kynge had admytted hys sonne Phylyp to the gydynge of the realme / he dyed, and was buryed at saynt Denys / leuyng after hym the issue forenamed, whan he hadde reygned after moste wryters .xxxi. yeres.

But this was of suche cruelty, that he sent Alfrycus archbysshoppe of yorke and erle Goodwyne vnto westmynster / commaundynge them for the iniury by hys brother Harolde before done vnto his moder Emma, that they shuld drawe the corps out of ye place where it was buryed, and to be throwen into the ryuer of Thamys / which was done accordynge to hys wyll. whych corps after as testyfyeth Guydo and other, was founden by a fyssher / and buryed vnreuerently within the chyrcheyarde of saynt Clement standyng wythout the Temple barre of London.

Lette the herers to thys gyue credence as them lyke / for to me it semeth though the kyng had ben of suche cruelty, that the bysshop forenamed wolde not haue ben the executour of so fowle a dede.
                     Thys kyng also leuyed the forenamed trybute named Dane gelt, &amp; spent it to the lytell comforte of the realme / but gaue vnto shypmen and maryners, and other lewde persons, greate and vnsyttynge fees and wages / and was of suche prodegalyte, that his bourdes and tabelles of his courte were spred .iiii. tymes in the daye / and the people serued of great excesse both of mete &amp; also of drynke.
                     wyth leuyeng of the foresayd try bute the comons greatly grudged / so that in worceter two of hys seruauntes, whyche were assygned to gader that money were there slayne. For the whyche dede the kynge was so sore dyspleased, yt he brent a great parte of that towne.
                     Thys Hardykynutus after some authours, maryed hys syster named Gunylda vnto the thyrde Henry emperour. The whych was of passyng beaute / and was the doughter also of Emma laste wyfe of Canutus. But in processe of tyme thys Gunylda was falsely accused of spowsebrech / for tryall wherof she was put to her champyon. wherfore she beynge in greate agony / lastely trustyng to god, and knowyng her selfe without gylte of that offence, putte a

chyld that she wyth her had brought out of Englande in stede of the champyon. The whyche fought wyth a man of geauntes stature / and fynally hym slew, and broughte vnto confusyon.
                     when Gunylda by dyuyne power hadde thus clered her selfe / she vtterly refused the emperours company, and ended her lyfe in the seruyce of hym the onely god, that so hadde defended her ryght.
                     But yt shulde appere by Polycronycon, and also by Antoninus / that thys mayden was maryed to ye sayde Henry by the lyfe of her father Canutus, and also durynge the lyfe of the sayde Henryes father named Conradus the second, as before is touched in the storye of the sayde Canutus / and not by thys Hardykinytus her brother.
                     It is rad that the kynge betoke all the rule of the lande vnto hys moder and erle Goodwyn / the whyche had maryed as wytnessyth the englyshe cronycle, the doughter of Canutus gotten vppon hys fyrste wyfe Elgina. By whome many thynges were mysse orderyd / and specyally by the subtylyte of this erle Goodwyn. This erle had many sonnes, as wytnesseth Polycrony con in the .xxv. chapyter of hys .vi. boke. By his fyrste wyfe that was kynge Canutus syster, &amp; not hys doughter as is aboue sayde / he hadde one sonne. The whyche by vndyscrete strykynge of an horse, was throwen into the Thamys and drowned. And the mother was lastely smyttē wyth lyghtenyng and so dyed. Of whome yt is there remembred, that she was so vngracyous and of so vyle condycyon / that she set yonge womē to horedome, for to gader by that vnlefull meane ryches. After the whyche wyfe so dyed, he maryed the seconde / of whome he receyued .vi. sonnes. That is to wyt Swanus, Harolde, Tostius, wylnotus, Sirthe or Surthe, and Leoffricus / and a doughter named Goditha, whych after was maryed to Edwarde the confessour.
                     The two sonnes of Egelredus Alphredus and Edwarde, whych as ye before haue hard were sent into Normādy by Emma theyr mother / came in ye tyme of the reygne of thys kyng into Englande, for to vysyte and se theyr mother / &amp; brought wyth them a great nomber of Normans. Then thys Goodwyne ymagyned in hys mynde howe he myght preferre hys doughter Godyth to one of these bretherne / and thoughte in his mynde yt the eldest wold dysdayne that maryage. And for he thought to ioyne her vnto the yonger, and to make hym kynge and her quene / he compassed the deth of ye elder. And by this mean Goodwyn warned the lordes of Englande / and sayde yt was a great ieoperdye for the lande, to suffer so many straungers to entre the land without lycence / wherfore yt were necessary that they were punyshed to the example of other. By whych meanes he gat authoryte to order that mater as to hym semed beste or of his owne power, because he was of moste myght nexte the kynge. wherfore he yode and mette wyth the sayde Normans / and slewe of theym the moste nomber. For vppon Guylde downe he slewe alway .ix. &amp; saued the .x. And yet for he thoughte to many by that meane lefte a lyue / he eft agayne tythed agayne the sayd tythe, and slew euery tenth knyght of them and that by cruell deth / as wyndynge theyr guttes out of theyr bodyes, as sayth Polycronycon / and amonge other put out the eyen of the elder brother Alphredus, &amp; sent hym to Ely, where he dyed in short tyme after / all be it ye
                        
englyshe boke sayth yt he was slayne by the forenamed tormente. And Edwarde was conueyed and by some other waye broughte to hys mother. But she ferynge the treason of Good wyne, sente hym soone ouer the see agayne. Howe be yt the ynglyshe cronycle telleth all otherwyse. when Goodwyne was after accused for thys cruell dede / he sware depely yt he was forced of the kynge so for to do. But in one cronicle, I fynde that thys dede was executed by Goodwyne in the tyme of Harolde Harefote beynge kynge.
                     Then yt foloweth in the story / this kynge Hardykynytus beynge at a feste at Lambehyth besyde London, mery and iocande / whyle he stode drynkynge he fyll downe sodaynly, and dyed / or waxed dumbe, and lay tyll the .viii. daye after, the whyche was the .viii. daye of the moneth of Iune / and then dyed, when he hadde reygned after moste wryters two yeres / leuynge after hym none yssue of his bodye lawfull, and was buryed by his father at wynchester.
                     Thus here endeth the lyne or ofsprynge of Swanus and all other Danys / so that after thys kynge, the blood of Danys was clerely extyncte and putte oute from all kyngly dygnyte wythin thys realme of Englande. And also the persecution of thē seased clerely after thys kynges deth. The whyche had contynued, to rekē from theyr fyrst landynge in tyme of Brightricus kyng of west Saxon, &amp; the .ix. yere of his reygne, as in ye storye before is rehersed / by ye terme of .CC.lv. yeres.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCX. CHAPITER.
                     
                        EDward the son of Egelredus &amp; of Emma hys last wyfe / began his reygne ouer England, in the yere of our lord M .xliii / and the xiiii. yere of Henry then kynge of Fraunce. The whyche after the deth of Hardykinitus was sente for into Normandye / and pledges layde for hym, that he wythout fraude shulde be made kynge. And then he came wyth a few straunges. But as sayth Marianus / some of the lordes had sent for Edwarde the outlaw son of Edmunde Ironsyde, for to be theyr kynge. But after the affyrmaunce of the said authour / when he knew that Edwarde hys neuewe was in possessyon of the lande, he wolde medle hym no farther.
                     Then thys Edwarde by the great aduyse of Goodwyn̄ erle of west Saxon, and of Leofricꝰ erle of Chester / was crowned kyng at westmynster, of Edsius then archbyshop of Caunterbury / &amp; wedded in processe of time after, Goditha the doughter of erle Goodwyne, whych of Guydo is called Editha. The whych he entreatyd in suche wyse / yt he put her not from his bed, nor yet delte wyth her fleshely. whyther yt were for hate of her kynne, or forloue of chastite, ye trouth is not shewed. But all wryters agreen that he cōtynued his lyfe with outen offence wyth women.
                     This kyng discharged Engleshmen of ye great tribute called Dane gelt, yt whych before is sundry tyme spoken of / so yt after ye daye yt was no more gaderyd. And also he subdued ye Brytons or walshmen that made warre

wythin the bondes of ye land. But after yt theyr duke or leder called Gryffyn or Gryffyth, with ayde of ye Irysh men entred the ryuer of Seuerne, &amp; toke many prayes, and departed agayne wythout fyght.
                     In the tyme of the reygne of thys Edwarde / Emma his moder was accused to be familyer with ye byshop of winchester. Upō which accusaciō, by coūsayll of erle Goodwyn̄ he toke from her many of her iewellys, &amp; caused her to be keptsomdele more straitly in the abbay of warwell / and the byshop he cōmytted to the examynacyon and correccyon of the clergye. But his moder more sorowynge the defame of Alwyn̄ the byshoppe then her awne estate / wrote vnto dyuers byshoppes, and besought them of iustyce / affermynge yt she was redy to abyde all leful &amp; most sharpest triall.
                     Then dyuers of ye byshoppes made laboure to the kynge for her and for the byshop. But Robert then archebyshop of Caunterbury / beyng wyth theyr laboure dyscontended, sayde to them in this maner. My brethern bisshoppes sayd he, how dare ye defende her that is a wyld beste and not a woman? she hath defamed her own son the kynge, and nempned her lecherours lemman goddes owne preste. But be yt so that the woman wolde purge the preste / who shall then purge the woman, that is accused to be consentynge to the deth of her sonne Alphred, and procured venym to the poysonyng of her son Edwarde. But how so yt be that she be gylty or gyltlesse / yf she woll go barefoted for her selfe .iiii. steppes &amp; for the byshop .v, contynually vpon .ix. plough sharys brennynge and fyre hote / then yf she escape harmelesse, he shall be assoyled of this chalenge and she also.
                     Thys was of her graunted, and the daye of purgacyon assygned. At which day ye kyng &amp; grete part of his lordes were present / but this Robert fayled, were yt for pyte or otherwyse. Thys Robert was a monke of an house in Normandy, and came ouer by the sonde of the kynge / and was fyrste made bysshoppe of London, and after archbysshopppe of Caunterbury. Then the nyght before Emma shulde make her purgacyon / she went vnto the shryne of saynt Swythune at wynchester / and there kneled all that night in prayer and receyued dyuyne cōforte. Upon the morne she was blyndefelde / and ladde vnto the place betwene .ii. men, where the iron laye glowynge hote / and passed the .ix. sharys vnhurte. Then at last she sayde. Good lorde when shall I come to the place of my purgacyon. when they opened her eyen, and she sawe that she was paste the payne / she kneled downe and thanked God and saynte Swythune. Then the kynge repented hym / and restored to her that he before hadde taken from her, and asked of her forgyuenesse. But the archebyshoppe of Caunterburye fledde into Normandye. And thys Emma gaue then vnto the monastery of that holy confessour saynt Swythune .ix. maners / and the bysshoppe other .ix. as affermeth Polycronica and other.
                     It was not long after, that kyng Edwarde gaderyd a stronge nauye at Southampton̄, or more verely in the hauen of Sandwyche / for so myche as he was warned that Swanus kynge of Denmarke entended to make warre vppon hym. But Polycronycon sayth that he gadederyd thys nauy to wythstande Harolde Harfagar then kyng of North ganys, that entended to haue entred Englande. But he was letted by ye forenamed Swanꝰ, yt shortely after made warre vpō ye sayd Harold
                     
                        An other cronycle shewyth, that the Danys and Norgayns, whyche is to meane men of Norway / were agreed to come ioyntly into England. And whyle the kynge was shyppyng of his mne / one brought forth a bole full of mede or meth to drynke vpon bon vyage. And after that came bole after bole / so that after drynke came dronkenes, &amp; after iangelyng / &amp; iangelynge tourned into stryfe, &amp; stryfe tourned into fyghtynge / where thorough many were slayne / &amp; the other turned to theyr owne, so that that iourney was lefte of. But the legēde of hys lyfe in the chyrche telleth / that he beynge at masse in the chyrche of westmynster vppon a whytsondaye, in the tyme of the leuacyon of the sacrament he laught. wherof the lordes beynge aboute hym meruayled greatly / and after frayned of hym the cause. wherūto he answered and sayde, that the Danys wyth the Norwayes of one assente were purposed to haue comen into thys lande, and here haue taken prayes. But as the kynge of Danys shuld haue entred hys shyp, he fyll into the see and was drowned / so that I truste in my days they shall not, nor none other straungers make any warre in this lande.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXI. CHAPITER.
                     IN the tyme of thys Edwarde fyll passynge great snowe, the whyche began in the begynnynge of Ianuary, and so contynued tyll the xvii. daye of Marche or saynte Patrykes daye / wherof the great quantyte fyll in the weste countreys of Englande. And after that ensued great deth of men, and moreyne of beftes / and by lyghtnynge the corne vpon the ground that yere was wonderfull brent and wasted.
                     Aboute the .x. yere of Edwarde as moueth Policronyca, and in the moneth of September / Eustace erle of Bolongn̄ came a lande at Douer / whyche erle hadde wedded after the sayenge of the sayde authour, kynge Edwardes syster. Thys was parted frome hys companye in so secrete wyse, that hys knyghtes were fayne to serche for hym / wenynge to them that he hadde ben slayne by some of the dwellers of the towne. In the whyche serche they demeaned theym so vndyscretely, that they slewe a cytezyne of Douer. By meane wherof the people arose / and in the questyonynge of thys mannes deth, ran at length vppon the erles company, and slewe .xx. of hys men, and wounded many mo. Hastely the erle apperyd and toke his mennys parte. But in conclusyon he was fayne to wythdrawe hym selfe with a few persons, and rode vnto the kynge then beyng at Glouceter / and made vnto hym a greuous complaynte of the men of Douer.
                     Then erle Goodwyne, for so moch as to hym was commytted the rule of Kente / was charged to ryde thyther, and to take wreche of the inhabytaūtes of that towne. But he with sayde that commaundement / and counsayled the kyng to sende for the wardeyns of the castell of Douer and rulers of the towne, for to answere to suche maters as were layde agayne them, and yf they were gylty to punyshe them, and ellys not.
                     This answere of Goodwyn̄ pleased nothynge the kynge, nor suche as were aboute hym / wherfore many mo lordes were sent for. Amonge the which Leofricus erle of Chester, and Sewarde erle of Northumberland of myne authour ben named. After whych assemble of ye lordꝭ erle Goodwyne had suche monycyon of some of ye counsayll, yt he wythdrewe

hym from the courte, and gadered to hym strength of knyghtes out of dyuers shyres, as west Saxon &amp; Kent / and houed at Beuerston̄ tyl his sonnes came vnto him with more peple Soone after came vnto hym his eldest son named Swanus, &amp; brought wyth hym a fayre companye that he hadde arreyred in Oxenfordeshyre &amp; Gloucetershyre / and Harolde hys other sonne, wyth a feleshyppe that he had assembled in eest Englande, and Huntyngdon̄shyre / so that of these people was made a great hoste.
                     Then Goodwyn̄ to the kyng was accused, for gaderynge of so great an hoste. But he excused hym, and sayde, yt was done to wythstand the walyshmen. The whyche contrary proued / he was cōmaunded to sende awaye the people, and to come wyth a certayne nomber vnto the courte. But that he refused. Then the kyng wyth hys counsayll beynge at London / Goodwyn and Harold was eft sent for, and charged to come to the courte wyth .xii. persones wythoute mo / and to render into the kynges handes all knightes fees that he and Harolde his sonne hadde wythin Englande. To thys by theym was answered, that they myghte not come to the counsayll of treachours and gylefull men / and that also wyth so fewe men in nomber, they mygthe not wythoute parell or shame passe by the countrey.
                     In thys whyle a parte of Goodwyns knyghtes wythdrewe theym, and hys power beganne to mynyshe and the kynge in thys whyle hadde gaderyd a stronge hoste. Then proclamacyons were made, that Goodwyne shuld come to the courte as before is sayd / or auoyde the land with in fyue dayes. wherfore Goodwyne consyderyng the ieopardy yt he was in / toke wyth hym .iii. of his sonnes, that is to meane Swanus, Tosty, &amp; Gurthe / and sayled into Flaundres▪ where he was receyued of the erle Baldwyn after some wryters / whose doughter Swanus his sonne hadde before spoused &amp; was named Iudeth And Harolde and Leofricus two of his other sonnes with a few shyppes sayled out frō Brystow into Irland.
                     when the kynge was ascertayned that erle Goodwyne wyth hys fyue sonnes was in thys maner departed oute of his lande / he shortly after called a parlyament / and by authoryte of the same, outlowed Goodwyne &amp; hys .iii. sonnes that were gone wyth hym. And that done he put his owne wyfe and doughter of Goodwyn̄ into the abbaye of warwell wyth one mayden, as sayth Marianus. And so Goodwyn̄ and hys sayde sonnes contynued two yeres outlawed. In the whyche season he or hys retynue toke dyuers tymes prayes in ye marches of Englande / and in the ende drewe to hym suche strength, that he was purposed to haue entred the lande wyth force, and to haue warred vppon the kynge. But by medyatours that fauoured erle Goodwyn, a peace was made betwene ye kynge and hym / so that in processe he was receyued to grace wyth hys sonnes / &amp; hys doughter restored to her fyrste and former honoure. And for thys peace to be contynued / for Goodwyns parte was delyueryd for pledkes a sonne of hys called wylnotus, and a sonne of Swanus named Hacum or Hacun. The whyche .ii. pledges kynge Edwarde sent vnto wyllyam duke of Normandy to be kept. And Algarus the sonne of Leofricꝰ erle of Chester, to whbme the kynge had gyuen the erledome of Harold, &amp; ruled yt dyscretely in tyme of his absence / at hys returne delyuered yt to him again, gladly &amp; without grudge
                  
                  
                     
                     THE .CCXII. CHAPITER.
                     DUrynge the tyme of this out lauwry of Goodwyne / wyllyam bastarde duke of Normandye came with a goodly cōpany into this land, and was honorably receyued / to whom the kyng made great chere. And after he hadde taryed here a certayne of tyme to his agrement and pleasure / he retourned to hys owne wyth great gyftes &amp; pleasures. And Emma the kinges moder dyed shortly after, and was buryed a wynchester. And Swanus the eldest sonne of Goodwyne went to Hierusalem, and from thens towarde Lycia / and dyed by the waye of colde, that he had taken of goynge barefote. Then the Normans that had gyuen to the kynge euyll counsaylles agayne Englyshemen / were by Goodwyne and his frendes exyled. Among the whyche Robert archebyshop af Caunterbury that hadde spoken sore agayne theym was one / whych after went to Rome to complayn to the pope then Leon̄ the .ix. or Uyctour the seconde. And whē he had receyued letters of ye pope directed to ye kyng / he returned to his abbay of Gemeticum in Normandye, where he somtyme had ben munke and abbot / and there dyed. After hym Stigandus was made his successoure / the whyche as sayth Policronicon, had before tyme lefte the byshopryche of Shyrborne, and toke the see of wynchester by strēgth. He also vsed fayres of holy chyrche thynges / and was a lewde or vnlettred man, as the more part of the bysshoppes of Englande at those dayes were. And ouer that he passed other in ryches and dyssymulacyon. But yet he neuer had ye palle from Rome, though there be great sale that maketh many maystryes.
                     Then was openly spoken that he was not worthy a byshopryche, that coude vse ye bragge or pompe of the worlde, the vse of voluptuosyte, of glotony and Lechery, the shynynge araye of clothynge, the countenaunce of knyghtes, and the gaderynge of horsemen, and thynketh full lytell on the profyte of soules. And yf men sayde to theym that a byshoppe shulde be chosen for holynesse of lyuyng, and for hys good clergye, and not for couetyse of money / they wold answere as foloweth, Nunc aliud tempus, alii pro tēpore mores. The whyche verse maye be englyshed in thys maner.

                           As tyme requyreth, so men done theym vse.
                           In wynter warme clothes, in somer lyght and lesse.
                           In tyme of sadnesse men done gamys refuse.
                           And in myrthe tyme, men myrthes theym dresse.
                           So in tyme passed, was vsed great sadnesse
                           In the chyrche. But nowe men lyghte be.
                           wherfore the maners muste wyth men agree.
                        
                     
                     SO that by such light answere they planed or excused ye sharpenesse of theyr mysse lyuynge.
                     About this tyme, whyche shuld by Ranulff be about the .xii. yeare of ye reygne of Edward / Marianꝰ the Scot that before I haue often named, that wrote myche of ye dedes of ye kynges of England / at the age of .xxv. yeres forsoke the world, &amp; went on pylgrymage / &amp; was after shorne munke at Coleyne in Almayne in the abbay of Scottes. whyche Marianus after some wryters was in great fauoure with Malcolyne kyng of Scottes.
                     In the .xiii. yere of kynge Edward the Scottes rebelled agayn ye kyng. wherfore Sewarde erle of Northumberlande,

by the kynges commaundement gadered a great hoste and entred that lande / and behaued hym so manfully, that in processe he subdued the Scottes, &amp; chased ye kynge out of his coūtrey / so that after kyng Edwarde gaue that kyngedome vnto Malcolyn̄ sonne of the kynge of Cumbrys, to beholden of hym &amp; hys heyres kynges, as chefe lordes of Scotlande.
                     Uppon Ester mondaye aboute the sayde yere Goodwyn̄ syttynge at the kynges bourde wyth other lordes in ye castell of wyndsore / yt happed one of the kynges cuppe berers to stumble and to recouer agayne, so that he shedde none of the drynke. wherat Goodwyn̄ lough, and sayde, nowe that one brother hath susteyned that other. wherby he ment that the one fote or legge hathe sustayned ye other from fallynge. wyth whyche wordes the kyng marked him &amp; sayd, Ryght so my brother Alfrede shuld haue holden me, ne had Goodwyn ben. The erle then conceyued that the kynge suspected hym of hys brothers deth / and sayde vnto the kynge in defendynge hys vntrouth: syr as I perceyue well it is told to the, yt I shuld be ye cause of thy brothers deth. So mought I sauely swalowe this mor fel of brede yt I here hold in my hāde, as I am giltlesse of the dede. But as soone as he had receyued the brede / forthwyth he was choked. Then the kynge commaūded hym to be drawē from the table / and so was conueyed to wynchester, and there buryed. Marianus sayth that as erle Goodwyn̄ sat at the kynges table at wynchester / he was sodaynly taken with a palsye or some other sykenes vpon the Ester mondaye, and dyed ye thyrd day after. And his lordshyppes were gyuen vnto Harold his eldest sonne then lyuynge / &amp; Haroldes erledome was gyuen to Algarus the sonne of Leofricus, whych was the erledome of Oxenford after some wryters. It was not longe after ye kynge Edwarde sent vnto the .iiii. Henry than emperour of Almayne, Aldredus bysshop of worceter, wyth other noble men / prayenge hym that he wolde sende vnto England hys cosyn Edwarde sonne of Edmūde Ironsyde / for so myche as he entended to make hym hys heyre. The whyche request was fulfylled, so that he came into Englande soone after / the whych as ye haue harde before, was named Edwarde the outlawe.
                     But as witnessyth Guydo and other the yere after that he came into Englande, he dyed at London, and was buryed at westmynster.
                     Thys yere folowynge kynge Edwarde thorough yll counsayll exiled wythout gylte Algarus the sonne of Leofricus. The whych assocyat hym wyth Gryffyne kynge or duke of walys / and destroyed ye countre of Harforde, &amp; dyd mych harme to ye towne, and set the mynster on fyre, and slew vii. chanons therof. Then the kyng sent Harolde agayn hym / the whiche chased the walshmen into theyr own boundes, and recoueryd the sayde towne by appoyntement holden by the sayde Algarus, and amended all hurtes before done by the walshmē / and lastely recouncyled the sayde Algarus and his companye vnto the kynges grace.

                     ABoute the .xv. yere of kynge Edwarde / dyed ye noble duke Sewarde ruler of Northumberland of the flux, of whome Guydo reherseth dyuers notable actes whyche I passe ouer. Of whom yt is radde that when he sawe well he shulde dye, he

caused hys armour to be put vppon hym / and so armed and syttynge in a cheyre, hauynge all the ryghtes of the chyrch sayde, that so yt became a knyght and man of honour to dye, &amp; not lyenge as an other mene man / and so dyed, &amp; was buryed at yorke. And hys erledome was after gyuen to Tosty or Costy son of Goodwyn̄.
                     In the yere folowynge or .xvi. yere of kynge Edwarde, dyed also ye good erle Leofricus erle of Mercia and of Chester / and was buryed in the abbay of Couentre, the whyche before he hadde buylded. This man purchased many great pryuyleges for ye towne of Couentre / and made it free of all maner of toll, excepte onely of horse. For the whyche to haue also free / the comen fame telleth, that after longe requeste made vnto hym by his wyfe named Godina, he graū
                        ted her to haue yt therof freed / wyth that that she wolde ryde naked thorough the towne / by meane wherof yt was freed. Then Algarus hys son was erle after hym.
                     Harolde then the eldeste sonne of Goodwyn̄ / was in great authoryte, &amp; ruled myche of the kynges armye.
                     The yere folowyng Algarus was accused by malyce / &amp; exylded the land. wherfore he fled agayne to Gryffyne duke of walis as he before had done, of whom he was ioyously receyuyd and maynteyned. The kynge therof beyng infourmed, sent Harolde into walys to make warre vppon Gryffyne. The whyche quytte hym in so knyghtely wyse / that he chased the walshmen, brent the sayde Gryffyns paleys at a place callyd Rutlan̄, and his nauy, and then returned into Englande about mydlent. But aboute rogacyon dayes nexte folowyng, the sayde Harolde with his brother Tosty was sente thyther agayne, wyth a stronge army. At whyche season they destroyed a great parte of walys, &amp; in conclusion brought the walshmen vnto dew subieccyon, and forced thē to gyue pledges for the contynuance of the same. And that done pursued so sore vppon the sayde Gryffyne, that in the ende his owne people for purchase of theyr owne lyues, slewe the sayde Gryffyne, and sent his hed vnto Harolde in the moneth of Auguste / so that after the deth of thys Griffyne by the commaundement of the kynge, the coūtrey of walys was commytted to the gydynge of the .ii. bretherne of Gryffyne / the whyche had fauoured more the kynges party in tyme of the foresayd warre then theyr brother. And this warre in walys thus brought to ende / Harold by his polycy recouncyled agayne Algarus erle of Mercia to ye kyngꝭ grace, so that he contynued in hys fauoure durynge hys lyfe after.
                     About thys tyme a woman of Bakley in Barkshyre vsed yll craftes of sorcery. The whyche as she was syttynge vpon a daye at a feste or great dyner / a crowe that she had lykyngly fedde and brought vp, kreked louder then he was accustomed to do▪ when the woman harde that noyse her knyfe fyll out of her hande, &amp; she waxed sodaynly pale. And with yt she beganne to syghe and sorow / &amp; sayd alas, this daye is my soule comen to the laste sorow. And so after that she had spoken those wordes / a messanger came to her, and sayde that her son and all her mayny was dede sodaynly. Then she was conueyed to her owne and was full syke. wherfore in haste she sent for an other son of hers that was a monke, &amp; a doughter yt was a nunne / at whose cōmyng she sayd to them in thys wyse. I am the woman that haue vsed yll crafte and enyll lyuynge / and in vayne I hoped to haue ben saued by your bedes

and prayers. But now I praye you that ye woll releue my tourmentes and paynes / for of my soule the iudgement is gyuen. wherfore in case that ye maye kepe my body from tourment, sewe it in an hartes skyn, and laye it in a troughe of stone and hyll it wyth lede close and iuste / and after do bynde it wyth barres of iron in moste strongest and sure wise, and cause ye .xl. ꝑsons to synge psalmes by nyght, and vppon the morne as many masses. And yf I lye so stylle iii. nyghtes, than burye my body on the .iiii. daye. But all thys was for noughte. For the fyrste nyght whyle the psalmes were in sayeng / ye strōge bandes were sodaynly to brokē / and one wyth a gresely loke was sene vppon an horse backe all blacke, &amp; cast thys woman behynde hym, &amp; so rode forth wyth so greate crye and noyse, that it was harde as sayth Polycronycon .iiii. myles thens.
                     Thys wolde I not haue shewed, but that I fynde it wryten and recorded of diuers authours.
                     Than to retourne to our fourmer story / as wytnessyth myne authoure Ranulfe, about ye .xx. yere of ye reygne of kynge Edwarde / Harolde sayled towarde Normandye to vysyte hys brother wylnotus and Hacun hys neuewe / the which as ye before haue harde were layde there for pledges for the peas to beholden vppon erle Goodwyns syde agayne the kynge. But he in his course of saylyng was weder dryuen by tempeste into the countre or prouynce of Pontyfe, or more verely into the puynce of Poūtyth / where he was taken as a prysoner, and sent vnto duke wyllyam of Normandy. The whyche forced hym to swere, that he in tyme folowynge shulde marye hys doughter / &amp; that after the deth of kynge Edward he shulde kepe the lande of England to hys behofe, accordyng to the wyll and mynde of Edwarde after some wryters. And after the opynyon of a nother cronycle wryten in latyn / the sayd Harolde for to be in the more fauour of duke wyllyā, shewed to hym that kynge Edwarde in presence of hys barony, had admytted the sayde wyllyam for his heyre / and couenaū
                        ted wyth hym, that yf he ouerlyued the kyng, he wold in saue wyse kepe the lande to hys vse. For the whyche tydynges &amp; promyse wyllyam graū
                        ted to hym hys doughter to wyfe, yt than was wythin lawfull yeres of maryage wyth greate dower. And for to cause Harolde to be the more stabler in hys promyse kepynge / he delyuered to hym Hacun hys neuew and sonne of hys brother Swanus, whyche he myche desyred, and kepte styll wylnotus the brother of ye sayd Harolde. After whiche couenauntes suffycyentely stablysshed and enacted / Harold departed from duke wyllyam wyth greate and ryche gyftes, and in processe of tyme landed in Englande. And at hys comynge to the kynges presence / he shewed to hym all that he had done in the foresayde maters / where wyth the kynge was well cōtented, as affermeth the sayd latyne cronycle.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXIIII. CHAPITER.
                     IN the .xxii. yere of kynge Edwarde as testyfyeth Ranulfe / Tostius the brother of Harolde was for cause not shewed disconted in the kynges courte, and went vnto Harforde in the marche of walys / where at that tyme the seruauntes of Harold by cōmaūdement of theyr mayster were besyed to make prouysyon for to receyue the kynge. But whan thys Tostius was thyder comen / he cruelly slewe the sayde seruaūtes of

hys brother, &amp; hacked them in small pecys, and caste them after in meresowce or salte. And that done sent worde vnto the kynge, yt yf he wolde come vnto hys feest, he shulde lacke no powdered mete, what so euer he hadde besyde.
                     Thys cruell dede sprange wyde, so that for it he was hated of all mē / in so mych that hys owne tenauntes the men of Northūberland, of which prouynce he than was lorde of, arose agayne hym and toke frō hym that he hadde / and lastely chaced hym into Flaunders wyth a fewe persons than a waytynge vppon hym. But ye vertuouse kyng Edward not beyng contented wyth the comons doynge, consyderynge it to be done wythout hys aduyce and cōmaūdement / sent thyder Harolde to do correccyon vppon the heddes or capytayns of the Northumbers. wherof they beynge acerteyned cōtynued theyr strength and mette wyth Harolde &amp; hys people / and sent hym to vnderstāde that they were frely borne, and frely nourysshed, &amp; that they myght nat suffer no cruelnesse of dukes. Also they had lerned of theyr elders &amp; soueraynes to meyntayn fredom or to suffer deth and to lyue in quyetnesse vnder an easy duke. whan Harolde had receyued thys message, and aduertysed ye strength of the Northūbers / he perceyued well that wythout greate effusyon of blode he myghte not correcte the mysse doers. wherfore it semed to hym better to fauour the coū
                        tree, than to take hede of the synguler profyte of hys brother / so that he retorned to the kynge wyth thys answere, and purchased theyr pardon of hym / and also procured so ye kyng, ye he assygned to them an other duke or erle that was named Malcarus. And Tostius hys brother wyth hys wyfe &amp; chyldern remayned in Flaunders, durynge the kynges lyfe.
                     Kynge Edwarde in the .xxii. yere of hys reygne, syttyng at mete vpon Eester day in his paleys of westmynster, sodaynly lowghe, whan other dyd talke and eate. whan thys blessyd man had dyned, and was entred into his chamber / his famylyers asked of hym ye cause of hys lawghyng To whom he answered / for ye same selfe tyme sayd he .vii. slepers, that in the mount Seleon besydes Ephesym in Asya the lasse, had slepte two hundred yeres or there about vpon the ryght syde / the selfe same tyme they tourned them, and shall slepe agayne vpon that other syde .lxxiiii. yeres. Though thys be tolde of Ranulphe &amp; other / syth in thys sayenge appereth some dyscordaunce wyth other wryters / &amp; also wyth the former sayenge of the sayde Ranulphe in the .xxii. chapyter of hys .iiii. boke of Polycronycō, where he sayth that the sayd .vii. slepers were closed in ye caue / the fyrst yere of Decius, and so sleped contynuyngly to the laste tyme or yeres of Theodocius the youger than emperour / by whyche reason they shulde slepe about ye season or space of .ii. hundred yere as aboue is sayd / and than arose and shewed them to that sayd Theodocius emperour and many other / &amp; dyed soone after, as wytnessyth Uincencius hystorialis, Antoninus, Iacobus Philippus, and other: wherfore it can not stande wyth reasō, yt they shulde slepe vpon ye other syde after ye tournyng .lxxiiii. yeres, as is aboue sayd / nor that they shulde sterue in ye tyme of thys holy kynge and confessoure. For hys tyme of reygne was after ye tyme of Theodociꝰ aforesayd, more than .vi. hundred yeres. But yf it be ment by some other. For there are vii. other slepers spoken of in ye .xxvi. chapyter of the fyrste boke of Polycronycon,

that hath slepte in a nother caue many yeres. wherfore I remytte thys vnto other, and folowe the order of the story. wherein it is founde, that whan this blessed kyng Edwarde had receyued by dyuyne monycyon, that he shulde chaunge thys transitory and bryckell lyfe for the lyfe euerlastynge / he sykened in the Crystmasse weke. In tyme of whych sykenesse was shewed to hym a vysyon, that he after shewed vnto suche as were about hym / and sayde two men of relygion came to me that I somtyme was famylyer wyth in Normandye / and shewed that they were sent from god vnto me, to gyue vnto me warynynge of such thynges as foloweth. And fyrste they sayde that for the dukes, bysshoppes, and abbotes of Englande, be not goddes seruauntes, but the deuyllys / god hath taken thys kyngdome into the handes of enemyes for a tyme / and fendes shall walke and destroble the people. Than I besought god that the people myghte haue warnynge, and do penaunce and be delyuered, as the people were of the cytye of Ninyue. Nay sayde they / for these men be so indurate of harte, ye they shulde do no worthy penaunce, nor to them god shall shewe hys mercy nor forgyuenesse. Than I asked of them / whā myghte be hope of mercy and pardō. They answered / whan a grene tree is hewen downe, and a parte therof cut from the stocke, and layde .iii. fourlonge from the stocke / and wythout mannes helpe or hande shall retourne to his stocke or rote, and take agayne hys shappe, and than flouryshe and brynge forth fruyte. whan thys is done / than maye be hope of comforte and of remedy.
                     In the tyme that this blessyd man shewed thus thys vysyon / was present there wyth other, Stygandus archebysshoppe of Caunterbury. The whyche sayde vnto the other, that the kynge raued or ellys doted for age and sykenesse, as olde men done / and accompted these wordes for foly and vanyte. But not longe after Englande felte and conceyued thys prophecye / whan it was in subieccyon of straungers and alyauntes as after shall be shewed.
                     Than who that is desyrous to knowe the exposycion of the prophecye of the grene tree / lette hym rede in the ende of the lyfe of thys gloryous kynge and confessoure, translated by wyllyam Caxton, in the boke called the Legende of sayntes / and there he shall fynde it. All be it that in other places I haue sene it otherwyse interpreted / the whyche I remytte to them that haue experyence in suche facultye. And to conclude thys storye / trouth it is that this blessyd kynge dyed the .iiii. daye of Ianuary, whan he hadde reygned .xxiii. yeres, vii. monethes, and odde days / and was buryed in the monastery of westmynster, y• whych he before had gretly augmēted &amp; repayred / but nat in that maner and fourme that it is nowe in. For the chyrche that nowe there standeth, was so reedyfyed and buylded newe of Henry the thyrde and sonne of kynge Iohn̄. The whiche also after some wryters / translated thys blessyd kynge Edwarde from the lower parte of ye chyrche, and shryned hym there he now lyeth. And this kynge Edwarde laft after hym no chylde / for he was accompted for a vyrgyn whan he dyed.
                  
                  
                     
                     Francia. THE .CCXV. CHAPITER.
                     
                        PHylyp the fyrst of that name &amp; son of Henry / began his dominiō ouer the Frenchemen, in the yere of our lorde .M.lviii / &amp; the .xvi. yere of Edwarde the confessour than kynge of Englande. And of thys Phylyp it is radde, that he maryed a wyfe named Berta the doughter of Baldewyne erle of Holland and of Fryce. Of the whyche Berta this Philyp receyued a sonne and named hym Lewis / and a doughter ye was called Cunstaūce. But in processe of tyme he haunted so myche the company of a woman named Bertande, that he hated hys laufull wyfe / and at length helde her in pryson, and kept that other in her stede / and gatte vppon the sayd Bertrande two sonnes named Phylyp &amp; Florys, and a doughter which myne authour nameth not. For thys aduoutry, he was often monysshed of ye pope, that he shulde leue the companye of that yll woman, and take to hym hys lawfull wyfe yt he so longe had holden in pryson within hys castell of Monsfruell. And for he wolde not be obedyent vnto the popes coū
                        sayll / he was fynally accused of pope Urbane the seconde of that name. By meane wherof he was reconcyled and restored agayne to his wyfe, and refused hys concubyne.
                     And in the tyme of thys Phylyp / Godfrey de Bolliō with many other crysten prynces, at the exortacyon of Peter the heremyte, sayled into the holy lande / and wanne the cytye of Hierusalē out of the Sarasyns handes. whyche prynces lastly crowned the sayd Godfrey kynge of the sayde cytye. And after it so contynued in possessyon of crysten men, by ye terme of foure score and tenne yeres, vnder ix. crysten kinges / and lenger myght haue endured, hadde not discencyon fallen amonges them selfe. And so by Antoninus, Peter Disrey, and other it is manyfestely shewed. Thys vyage after moste accorde of wryters, begā in the yere of grace .M.lxxxvi. and the .xxvii. yere of thys Phylyp. And the sayd Godfrey was crowned kynge of the sayde cytye of Hierusalem after the affyrmaunce of ye sayde wryters, in the yere of grace a thousande and foure score and .xix.
                     Of thys Phylyp lytell worthy memory is lefte in wrytynge. For lyke as hys fader Henry made hym kyng by his lyfe, and suffered hym to haue the rule of the lande / ryght so thys Phylyp after a certayne of tyme, cō
                        mytted the rule of the lande vnto Lewys his sonne. And he sette hys mynde to huntynge and other dysportes / and so ladde hys lyfe in all slowthe and idelnesse.
                     Than Lewys takynge vppon hym the charge of the realme / subdued the erle of Mounte Merusy &amp; other / that laboured to take from the chyrche of saynt Denys certayn preuyleges / and also constrayned them to restore and satysfye all hurtes and harmes to the sayde chyrche by them done.
                     Thys Lewys as affermeth the Frenche cronycle, maryed the doughter of Guy erle of Cotcheforde / the whyche after for nerenesse of kynne was deforced from the sayde Lewys, to the greate dyspleasour of the sayde erle Guy. wherfore he moued warre agayne the sayd Lewys, and toke from hym certayne holdes and castelles / of the whyche the castell of Gurney was one. But at length Lewys had ye better of that warre, and

recoueryd diuers of the sayd holdes. And amonges other prysoners by hym and his knyghtes takē / he toke a myghty and stronge captayn of the sayde erle Guy named Hombolde, the whyche he sente to the castell of Stampes, there sauely to be kepte. Durynge whyche warre, Philyppe the kynge sykened / and dyed the yere of grace .M. a hundred &amp; .vi, when he hadde rygned full .xlviii. yere / and was buried at saint Benet sur Loyt.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXVI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        HArolde ye second son of erle Goodwyne, and laste kynge of Saxons / began to rule the realme of Englande ye v. daye of Ianuary, and the yere of our lorde .M. and .lxvi / and the .viii. yere of Phylyp the fyrst then kynge of Fraunce. This as moste myghty, for so myche as the blessyd kynge Edwarde dyed wythout yssue, not myndyng the promysse of hym before made vnto wyllyam duke of Normādy as before I haue shewed / toke vpō him as kyng, and was crowned of Aldredus then byshoppe of yorke. All be yt as affermeth Guydo and other, some of the lordes entended to haue made Edgare Adelynge kynge / whyche Edgare as affermeth ye sayde authours, was sonne to Edwarde that was the sonne of Edmund Ironsyde, and named of some Edwarde the outlawe. But for this Edgare was yong, and specyally for Harolde was strong of knightes and rychesse / he wanne the reygne. Howe be yt Marianus sayth that kyng Edwarde ordeyned before his deth, that Harolde shuld be kyng after hym. By reason wherof, the lordes crowned hym therupppon at westmynster.
                     Anon as he was crowned / he beganne to fordoo euyll lawes and customes before vsed, and stablysshed the good lawes, and specyally suche as were for the defence of holy chirch and punyshed the euyll doers, to the fere and example of other.
                     In shorte tyme after that Harolde was thus made kynges / Tosty or Costy hys brother, whyche as before is sayde, was of the Northumbers chased into Flaundres, made hym a nauy of .lx. small sayles, and sayled about the ile of wyght, &amp; toke prayes wythin the sayd yle and other places of Kent. And from thens he sayled in to Lynsey, &amp; dyd there myche harme both with fyre and sworde. But soon after he was chased thens by Edwyn̄ and Malcharus erles of Mercia &amp; of Northumberlande. And then he sayled into Scotland, &amp; taryed there tyll the somer after.
                     when Tostius was thus wyth hys robbers chased / then Harolde Harfagar kynge of Northganys or Norways, wyth a great nauy of .iii. hundred shyppes or mo, entred ye mouth of the ryuer of Tyne. Thys Harolde Harfagar as sayth Guyde, was the sonne of Canutus, and kyng of Denmarke and of Norway. The whych heryng of the deth of holy Edward / purueyed ye sayd great armye to wyn Englande, as his ryghtfull enherytaunce. when Harolde was warned of thys great flote of Danys / he sent vnto the forenamed erles or dukes of Mercia and of Northumberland / commaundyng them to wythstande theyr landrynge, whyle he gadered hys strength. Then the foresayde dukes spedde theym towarde the Danys, and gaue vnto them a sharpe &amp; stronge fyght. But in conclusyon the

Englyshemen were put to the worse, and were fayne to gyue backe / so yt the enymyes entred farther into the lande. The kyng herynge of the scō
                        fyture of hys people, made the more haste towarde hys enymyes / so that the .vi. day after he came to Stemysforde brydge. In thys whyle was Tostius before named come oute of Scotlande, and gone to the partye of the Danys agayne hys owne brother. In thys foresayde place bothe hostes ioyned / and faught then there a sharpe cruell batayll. wherin fyll many a sturdy knyght vppon the englyshe partye, but mo vppon the Danys syde / so that in the ende Harolde theyr kynge was slayne, and that of the hande of Harolde kynge of Enlande as sayth Guydo / and Tostius was also slayne in the same fyghte. Olanus broter to the sayth Harolde Harfagar, with Paulus duke of the yles of Orkeys / were there taken prisoners. The whyche the kynge caused to hym to be sworne, to kepe such promises as they to hym there made, and toke good pledges for performaunce of the same, and after suffred theym to retourne from thens they were comen.
                     It ys also specyally remembred of the sayd authour / that one knyght stode vppon the foresayde brydge, and wyth his axe defended the passage maugre the hole hoste of ye Englyshemen, and slew .xl. Englyshmen or mo wyth hys axe / and myght not be ouercomen, tyll an Englysheman went vnder the brydge and stycked hym vpwarde wyth hys spere thorough an hole of the brydge.
                     For thys vyctory Harolde was suppressed wyth pryde, and also wyth couetouse / so that he dyuyded not the prayes of hys enymyes amonge hys knyghtes, but kepte theym to hym selfe / or gaue parte vnto suche 
                           •
                        nyghtes as he fauoured, and spared to them that had well deserued / by reason wherof he loste the fauour of many of hys knyghtes.
                     In thys passetyme / the doughter of duke wyllyam, the whych Harold shuld haue maried, dyed within age. wherfore Harold thought hī ye more discharged of his ꝓmise before made to her fader. But duke willyam warned Harolde of couenauntes broken, and medled menasses wyth prayers by sondry tymes. wherunto Harolde answered, that a nyce folyshe couenaunte ought not to be holden / &amp; namely ye behest of other mennys ryght and kyngdome, wythout the hole assent of the senatours of ye same land. And farthermore a lewde othe might and ought to be broken / and specyally when yt is compelled to be sworne for nede or for drede.
                     Uppon these answers receyued by duke wyllyam from Harolde / in the whyle that messangers went &amp; came, duke wyllyam gadered hys knyghtes, and prepared his nauy and all other thinges necessary to the warre, &amp; had assent of the lordes of his land to ayde and assyste hym in his iourney. And ouer that he in such wise enformed the pope, then beynge named Alexander the second / yt he cōformed hym in takynge of that vyage / and sent vnto hym a banner, the whyche he willed hym to bere in the shyp that he hym self shuld sayle in. And so beynge purueyed of all thynges concernyng his iourney, he sped hym to the see syde, &amp; toke shyppynge in the hauen of faynt Ualery / where he taryed a longe tyme or he myght haue a couenable wynde. For ye whych his soldyours murmured &amp; grudged / and sayd it was a woodnesse &amp; great dyspleasynge to god, to desyre an other mann
                           •
                        s kyngdome by strength / &amp; namely when god wythsayde yt by the

workynge of his element.
                     At the laste when duke wyllyam had longe bydden and houed for the wynde / he commaunded to brynge forth ye body of saynt Ualery, and to be sette vppon the see stronde. The whyche done / the wynde shortely after came about and fylled the sayles. Then wyllyam thanked god &amp; saynt Ualery / and toke shortely after shyppynge, and helde his course to warde Englande / vppon thys grounde &amp; tytle folowynge.
                     The fyrste and pryncypall was to chalenge his ryghte / and to haue the domynyon of the lande that to hym was gyuen (as he affermed) of kyng Edwarde the confessoure and hys neuewe.
                     The seconde was, to take wreche of his deth &amp; cruell murdour of hys neuew Alfrede, and brother of ye blessyd kynge Edwarde / that was slayn of erle Goodwyne and his adherentes, as before ye haue harde in the storye of Hardykinitus / the whyche dede he ascrybed chefely vnto Harolde And the thyrde was, for to auenge the wronge done vnto Robert archebyshop of Caunterburye / whych as he was enformed / was exiled by the meanes and labour of Harolde, in the tyme of Edwarde the cō
                        fessour, as before is shewed.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXVII. CHAPITER.
                     DUke wyllyam kepynpe hys course / landed in processe of tyme at Hastynge in Sussex, in a place called Peuenessey. And in hys goynge oute of his shyp, and takyng the land / hys one fote slode, and that other stacke faste in the sande. The whych espyenge one of his knyghtes yt was nere vnto hym / cryed alowde and sayd, now syr duke thou holdest Englande, and thou shalte soone be tourned from a duke to a kynge. The duke of this made game, and entred further into the lande / and made his proclamacyons and cryes, that no man shuld take any prayes, or do any force to the people. For he sayde that yt was reasonable that he shuld spare that thynge that shulde be hys owne.
                     Harolde in thys whyle was in the North partes of Englande, and had wittynge of the landynge of the Normayns / and sped hym towarde them in all that he myghte, and gatheryd his strength by the countreys as he came. But the duke made so good spede, that he came to Lōdon before the kynge. where he was holden out, tyll he had made good suertye, that he and hys people shulde passe thorough the cytye wythout taryenge. The whyche was obseruyd. And so he passyng the cytye / passed the bridge, and went ouer into Sussex.
                     Kynge Harolde entendynge to know the strēgth of his enmyes, sent espyes into the dukes hoste / the whyche made reporte vnto the kynge, that all duke wyllyams soldyours were prestes. For they had theyr ouer lyppes and chekes shauen / and the Englyshmen at these dayes vsed the here of theyr ouer lyppes shadde and not shauen. But Harold to that answered and sayde, they be no prestes, but are stalworth and sturdye knyghtes.
                     Then Gurth or Surth one of the yongeste bretherne of Harolde / counsayled hym that he shulde stande a parte, and suffer hym wyth other of hys lordes to fyght with ye Normās, for so myche as he was sworne to the duke and they were not / aledgynge furthermore, that yf they were ouerthrowen, yt yet he myght defende hys quarell and fyghte for the countrey.
                     
                        In this meane tyme wyllyam sent a monke vnto Harold, and proferred to hym thre maner of wayes / and to chose one of the thre.
                     The fyrste, that accordynge to his othe he shulde render the lande, or delyuer yt vnto the possessyons of wyllyam. And ye done / to take yt agayne of hym, and hold yt of hym as in fee / &amp; so to reygne vnder hym for terme of hys lyfe / and after his deth to retourne yt to the sayd wyllyam, or to suche one of his sonnes as he wolde assigne it vnto. Or secondly, leue the kyngedome without more stryfe. Or thyrdely in exchewynge of shedynge of the more plenty of Crysten mēnes blood / that he wold defende his quarell in hys owne persone agayne the duke / and they two onely to trye the mater by dynte of sworde. But Harolde refused these offers / and sayde he wolde trye his quarell by dynt of swordis, and not by one sworde / and that he and hys knyghtes wolde defende theyr coūtrey agayn all straūge nacyons, prayenge to god to deme the ryghte betwene them twayne.
                     when duke wyllyam hadde receyued this answere from Harolde, and same well that there was no meane but fortune in batayll: he charged his people yt myght watche, to occupye theym in prayer / and specylly the prestes and the religious people, where the Englyshemen gaue them all to drynke and songe.
                     Then vppon the morowe beynge saterdaye, and the .xiiii. daye of Occtober, and the daye of saynte Calyxte the pope / bothe hostes assayled other, in that place where as nowe standeth the abbay of Batayll in Sussex. In the begynnyge of thys batayll / a banner or a banneret called Thylfer a Norman splayed before the hoste of Normans / and slewe an Englysheman or knyghte that came agayne hym / and after that one other, and so the thyrde, and was slayne at the laste.
                     Then the seltrons smote to gyther wyth a great noyse and crye, and faughte sore a longe season. And the Englyshmen defended them manfully / and the better for that that they kepte theym hole to gyther wythoute scaterynge or spryngynge a brode. The whyche when wyllyam apperceyued / he gaue a sygne vnto hys knyghtes, that they shulde gyue backe, and make countenaunce as they dyd flee. Then the Normans imbatelled the fote men, and sette horse men for wynges on euery syde. By the whyche wyle the Englyshemen were descueryd, and soone oute of araye / and the Normans tourned agayne vpon ye Englyshemen, and slewe theym downe on euery syde.
                     Thys batayll was sore foughten of the Englyshemen / that duke wyllyam was thryse felled that day by reason that thre horse were that daye slayne vnder hym. Lastely Harolde was wounded in the eye wyth an arowe, and fyll to the grounde and was slayne, and hys people scatered / so that well was hym that myghte saue hym selfe by fleynge Then duke wyllyam buryed hys men that there were slayne / and fuffred hys enymyes to do the same.
                     Of the deth of thys Harolde ys dyuersly wryten. For Geraldus Crambrens. in hys boke called Itinerarius sayth, yt after Harolde had receyued many woundes, and loste hys lefte eye / he fledde from that felde to the countrey of Chester, and lyued longe after an holy lyfe as an ancre, in the selle of saynte Iamys faste by saynt Iohn̄s chyrch, &amp; made there an holy ende.
                     when ye deth of Harold was knowen

to the erles of Mercia and of Northumberlande / the whyche for streytnesse of waye myght not bryng theyr people to that felde / or ellys for that that they wylfully wythdrew theym selfe from Harolde, bycause he none otherwise departed ye prayes amonges them and theyr knyghtes at the former feld of Norgaynes: then they drewe the next waye to London, and take Agatha Haroldꝭ wyfe and sent her to Chester. And they and Aldredus byshoppe of yorke with the Londoners / agreed and promysed eyther vnto other, that they wold make Edgare Athelynge kynge, and defende hys ryghte to the vttermoste of theyr powers.
                     But that promyse not wythstandynge, when they harde of the great strength that dayly fell to duke wyllyam and of hys prouysyons / they were fayne to breke that appoyntement. And the sayd erles submytted them, and gaue vnto hym pledges, and became to hym his lyege men by homage and feautye.
                     And thus when Harolde hadde ruled the lande from the .v. daye of Ianuary to the .xiiii. daye of October / he was slayne, when he had reygned ix. monethes and odde dayes / and was buryed at the monasterye of the holy crosse of waltham, whyche he before hadde founded, and set therin chanons, and gaue vnto theym fayre possessyons.
                     And here endeth for a time y• blood of Saxons / the whych contynued to reken from Hengestus fyrste reygne, by the space or tyme of .v. hundred and .lxxxxi. yeres. And yf yt be rekened from the begynnyng of the west Saxōs / then yt endureth by ye terme of .v. hundred .lxv. yeres. whych cōtynued as rulers &amp; kinges of this land all the sayd tyme / onely except y• that passed betwene the fyrst yeres Canutus, and the laste yere of Hardekynitus. In the whyche season passed or flowed vpon .xxiiii. yeres. All be yt yt the persecucyon of the Danys lasted mych lenger, as to fore I have shewed in ye story of ye forenamed Kynitꝰ.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXVIII. CHAPITER.
                     THen for as myche that god of his vnknowen iudgementes to man, and by his hygh &amp; hyd counsayll, wolde suffer this duke to conquere so noble a lande, and to be lord and souerayne ouer so many noble enherytours, as were &amp; now be with in the same: I thynke yt cōuenyent to shew here the dyscent of the sayde duke / and how nere of blood he was vnto the blessed kynge Edwarde the confessour.
                     wherfore as before to you I haue shewed in the storye of Charlys the Symple somtyme kynge of Fraūce / a myscreaunt or a pagan named Rollo ꝑsecuted sore the realm of Fraūce- &amp; lastely wan by strength the citye of Roan the hed or chefe cytye of Normandy. And in conclusyon for a fynall peace betwene the sayde kynge and Rollo to be had / the sayde Rollo was crystened &amp; named Robert, and maryed Silla the doughter of ye said Charlys. To whom ye kyng gaue in waye of Dower, ye hole duchy of Normandy. The whych Robert after he was crystened / ruled that dukedome as a good crysten man, by the terme of .xiiii. yeres / and receyued of ye sayd Silla a son, and named hym wyllyam / the whyche after was surnamed Longa spata, as who wold saye wyllyam wyth a longe sworde.
                     This wyllyam was duke after his fader .xxv. yeres / and lefte after hym a sonne named Rycharde, whych as before is shewed in the storye of Lew es ye .vi. was named Richard ye hardy.
                     
                        Then Rycharde the hardy was the thyrde duke, and reygned .lii. yeres / &amp; had by hys wyfe a son named Rycharde the good, and Emma that was wyfe to Egelredus and mother to saynte Edwarde the confessoure. After hym the Good Rycharde was duke, and reygned .xxviii. yeres / and lefte after hym two sonnes, that is to say Rycharde and Robert. The fyrste after two yeres was slayne by treason of hys brother Robert / so that Robert was then duke and reygned .ix. yeres. The whyche Robert, as yt is before shewed in the storye of Henry kyng of Fraunce / was father vnto this duke wyllyam. And thys wyllyam was the .vii. duke of Normandye / and ruled yt or he conquered Englande after moste wryters .xxx. yeres.
                     whereby yt appereth, that Emma was aunte to duke Robert, father of wyllyam Conquerour. And saynte Edwarde and this duke wyllyam were by ye fathers syde cosyn

                     THE .CCXIX. CHAPITER.
                     
                        WIllyā duke of Normandye surnamed Conquerour, baste sonne of Robert ye vi. duke of that said dukedome, and neuew vnto Edward the confessour, as before is shewed / beganne hys domynyon ouer thys realme of Englande, the .xv. daye of October, in the yere of our lordes incarnacyon a thousand &amp; .lxvii / and ye ix. yere of the fyrste Phylyppe then kyng of Fraunce / and was crowned kynge of the same vppon Crystmas daye nexte folowynge, of Aldredus archbyshoppe of yorke, for so myche as at that tyme Stigandus archbysshoppe of Caunterbury was then absent, or durste not come in the p̄sence of the kynge / to whome he ought no great fauour, as in the sequele shall appere.
                     when wyllyam had sette in quyet a great parte of thys lande, he betoke the gydyng therof to his brother the byshop of Bayon / and in lent folowynge sayled into Normandye / and led wyth hym the chefe rulers of England, for doute of sturryng in tyme of his absence. Amonge the whyche, the two erles Marcarꝰ and Edwyne rulers of Northumberlande &amp; Mercia were two / wyth also Stigandus and Edgare Ethelynge. To the why the Stigandus wyllyam shewed great reuerence and coūtenaunce of fauoure. But all proued to great dissymulacyon after / as was shewed by the depryuynge of the sayd Stigandus,

and prysonment of hym in wynchester towne, by a longe terme and season.
                     In the next wynter, whan wyllyam had sped hys besynesse in Normandy / he retourned into England wyth greate pompe, and sette a greuous trybute vpon the Englyshmen By reason wherof some partyes of the lande rebelled agayne hym, and specyally the cytye of Excetour, the whyche defended hym for a certayne of tyme. But lastly by force he wanne the sayde cytye, and punysshed the cytesyns greuously.
                     For thys and other sterne dedes of wyllyam / Marcharus erle of Northumberlande, wyth Edgare Athelynge and dyuers other, as hys moder and two systers Margarete and Crystyan, sayled into Scotlande. But another cronycle telleth, yt Edgare entendynge wyth Agatha hys moder and hys two systers, to haue sayled into Almayne where he was borne / was by tempest of the see dryuen into Scotlande. where of Malcolyne than kynge of Scottes they were ioyously receyued. And in processe of tyme the sayde Malcolyne caste suche loue vnto the sayd Margaret / that he toke her to wyfe / as before is touched in the fyrste chapyter of the story of Canutꝰ. Of the which Margaret the sayde Malcolyne receyued .ii. doughters and .vi. sonnes. wherof thre named Edgare, Alexaū
                        der, &amp; Dauyd, were kynges of Scotlande nexte folowynge theyr fader. And Molde one of ye foresayd doughters was after maryed vnto the fyrst Henry kynge of Englande. And the other doughter Mary / was maryed to Eustace erle of Bolongii. Of Molde the fyrste doughter / Henry receyued .ii. sonnes named wyllyam and Rychard, the whych bothe dyed before theyr fader / as after in ye story of the sayd Henry shall appere. And he receyued also two doughters named Molde and Mary / whych Molde or Mawde was maryed to ye fyfte Henry emperour of Almayne. After whose deth she was agayne maryed to Godfrey of Geoffrey Plātagenet erle of Aungeowe. Of whom descended Henry surnamed shorte mantell, and kynge of Englande, called Henry the seconde. And the other doughter Mary was maryed vnto the erle of Blaynes / of whō descended Molde or Mawde, that was wyfe vnto kynge Stephen.
                     Than it foloweth, that thys wyllyam after thys foresayd trybute so leuyed of the Englysshemen, and knowynge of the depertynge of the lordes foresayde, kepte the other the streyter. But it was not longe after that Marcharus was reconsyled to the kynges grace / and fayled agayn as folowynge shall be shewed. For thys and other causes whyche were tedyous to shewe / wyllyam exalted the Normans, and gaue vnto them the chyefe possessyons of the lande / so that they dayly encreased in great honour and welth, and the Englysh men as faste decayed. Kynge wyllyā also made .iiii. stronge castels / where of two be sette at yorke, the thyrde at Lyndetyngham or Notynghm, and manned them wyth Normans, and the .iiii. at Lyncolne.
                     About the thyrde yere of his reygne Harolde &amp; Canutus sonnes of Swanus kynge of Denmarke, came on lande in the North of Humber wyth a stronge nauy / and in all haste drew them towarde yorke. Than the Normans whyche hadde the rule of the towne and castelles, feryng that the Englysshemen wolde ayde the Danys, and wyth the houses of the suburbes of the towne haue fylled the towne dyches / sette the suburbes on

fyre. wherof ye flame was so bygge, and wyth the wynde so stronge / that it toke into the cytye, &amp; brent a parte therof, wyth the mynster of saynt Peter. In tyme wherof the Danys by fauour of some of the citesyns entred the cytye / and slewe more than thre thousande of the Normans.
                     But it was not longe or kynge wyllyam chased the Danys to theyr shyppes / and toke so greate dyspleasure wyth the inhabytauntes of that prouynce, that he destroyed the land lyenge bytwene yorke and Durham in suche wyse, that .ix. yeres after or there about, the lande laye vnlabored &amp; vntylled / onely out taken saynt Iohn̄s lande of Beuerley, the which was for borne by reason of a wreche done by dyuyne power, vpon one of kynge wyllyams knyghtes. The whych as he was besyed in wastyng and spoylynge of the sayde countre, fyll sodeynly wyth hys horse / so that hys horse brake hys necke, and the knyghtes face was turned to his backe.
                     And of the famyne that the people of that countre susteyned / wonders are reported, that they shuld eate all maner of vermyn, as cattes, rattes, dogges, &amp; other / so harde they were kepte by the warre of the kyng. And in that yere also Molde or Mawde the wyfe of kynge wyllyā / was crowned quene of England, of Aldredus archebysshop of yorke.
                     In the .iiii. yere of the reygne of thys kynge the Scottes with Malcolyne theyr kynge entred Northumberlande / and wasted and destroyed sore that countre, and slewe there in myche people / and many they toke prysoners, &amp; helde thē as bonde men.
                     But in the .vi. yere of hys kyngdome, wyllyam made such warre vppon the Scottes / that he lastely forced the sayde Malcolyne to swere to hym bothe homage and feauty / as it is wytnessed of wyllyam of Malmesbery and other wryters.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXX. CHAPITER.
                     Kynge willyam by counsayle of the erle of Hortford and other, caused the abbeyes of Englande to be serched. And what money in them at that season was founde / he caused it to be brought to hys treasour. For the whyche dede after the exposycyō of some authours / the sayd erle was punysshed, as after shall be shewed.
                     Soone vpon thys in the tyme by twene Easter and wytsontyde / was holden a solempne counsayle at wynchester of the clergy of Englande. At the whyche counsayle were presente two cardynalles, sent from ye second Alexaunder than pope. In thys coū
                        sayle, Stygandus archebysshop of Caūterbury was depryued from his dygnytye / and that for thre skylles. The fyrste was / for that he had holden wrongfully that bysshopryche, whyle Robert the archebysshop was lyuynge. The seconde cause was / for that he hadde receyued the Paule of pope Benet the .v. of that name. And the thyrde cause was / for that he occupyed the sayd Paule wythout lycence &amp; lefull authoryte of ye courte of Rome.
                     Than Stigandꝰ proued that benyuolence of kynge wyllyam. For where before he made to him louyng and frendly countenaūce, &amp; dyd vnto hym greate reuerence / than he chaū
                        ged all his myldenesse into sternesse, and exceuted hym by ye popes authoryte / so that in the ende Stigandus was depryued of hys dygnytye, and kepte in wynchester as a prysoner ye terme of hys lyfe.
                     It is recorded of hym that he was so couetous and sparyng, yt he wold

take nothynge of hys owne / &amp; vsed to swere by Alhalowes, that he had not one peny. But that othe was proued vntrewe after hys deth, by a lytell keye that was founde fastened about hys necke. For by that keye was founden greate treasour vnder the erth in mo places than one.
                     In thys counsayle also were put downe dyuers other bysshoppes, abbotes, and pryours, by the meanes of kynge wyllyam / and all to the entent that he myghte preferre Normans to the rule of the chyrch, as he hadde preferred hys knyghtes to the rule of the tēperaltye, that he myght stande in the more suerty of the land.
                     In thys counsayle saynt wolstan̄ that than was bysshop of worceter / axed besely of the kynge certayne possessyons fallen into hys handes, by the deth of Aldredꝰ laste archbyshop of yorke, that were wyth holden by ye sayd Aldredus. But the kyng myght not here than of any suche maters, for hurtyng of the lyberty of the chyrche of yorke.
                     Than vpon wytsonday after / the kynge gaue the sayd archebysshopryche of yorke vnto Thomas a chanon of Bayon / &amp; sent for Lamfrank an other Norman than abbot of Cadomonency, and gaue vnto hym the archebysshopryche of Caunterbury. Thys Lamfranke was an Italyan borne / and was perfytely lerned in ye scyence of theologye or holy wrytte, &amp; ryght apte in gouernynge of thynges bothe spyrytuall and temporall. Upon our lady daye the Assumpcyō the kynge made hym archebysshop of Caūterbury. Than Thomas that was chosen archebysshop of yorke / came vnto Lamfranke for to be sacred as the vsage wolde. Of whom Lamfranke axed an othe, &amp; his professyon in wrytynge concernyng his obedyence. Thomas answered and sayde that he wolde neuer do that / but yf he myghte therof here suffycyent authoryte and skylfull reasons &amp; byndynge, by the whyche it myght be knowen that he shulde so do with out any preiudyce of hys chyrche. Than Lamfranke shewed and proued skylfully, that hys askynge was reasonable and ryghtfull. But yet Thomas wolde not assent / but with sayde it and went for that tyme from Lamfrank vnsacred / &amp; shewed vnto the kyng, that Lamfranke entended to do wronge to hym and to his chyrche of yorke. Than the kyng callyng Lamfrank before hym sayd, than he trusted more in his cunnyng than he dyd in good fayth or reason. But he answered so reasonably vnto ye kyng that in the ende Thomas by the cō
                        maundement of the kyng was fayne to come agayne to Lamfranke to be sacred / and wrote hys professyō with hys owne hande of hys obedyence and radde it / in the whyche was conteyned that he shulde be obedyent in all that belongeth to the worshyp of god and all crystē fayth▪ which done, he was sacred &amp; so deꝑted. And shortly after Lamfranke axed &amp; toke professyō of all ye byshoppes of Englād.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXI. CHAPITER.
                     IN the .v. yere of wyllyam the conquerours reygne / Edwyn and Marcharus erle of Mercia and of Northumberlande, beynge in fere of daunger, voyded ye kynges court secretly, and were rebelles som what of tyme. But at length it turned to bothe theyr harmes. For Edwyne was slayn as he went toward Scotlande / and erle Marcharus wyth ye bysshop of Dorcham named Egelwynus, toke the ile of Ely for theyr sauegarde. But the kynge held them so shorte, that in processe they were

fayne to yelde them to the kynges grace and mercy. Than he sent the bysshop to the abbey of Abyndon to be kept there as a prysoner / where he was so dayntely fed, that he dyed for hunger. But some wryters testyfye that he was so hyghe herted, that after he knewe he shuld remayne there as prysoner / he wolde neuer ete mete after. And erle Marcharus was had to the towre of London.
                     In the .vi. yere of hys reygne / kyng wyllyam, as before is touched went wyth a great army into Scotland / and subdued Malco
                           •
                        yne theyr kynge, as before I haue shewed in the precedynge chapyter.
                     In the .vii. yere of kyng wyllyam / Thomas archebysshop of yorke not beynge content to be vnder the rule and obedyence of Lamfranke, appealed to the courte of Rome / so that the sayde two archbysshoppes appered both in proper persone before the pope Alexaunder afore named. In whose presence Lamfranke was so well fauoured, that where Thomas aboue named and Remigius byshop of Dorchester, were for skylfull causes depryued of theyr croyses and rynges / he by hys fauour &amp; meanes restored them to theyr former dygnytees. The cause of Thomas was, for that he had holpen duke wyllyam to warde hys iourney into Englande. For the whyche the sayd duke promysed hym a bysshopryche yf he opteyned vyctory. And ye other was depriued, for yt he was proued a prestes sonne. Than Thomas moued the cause of the prymacy of Caunterbury, &amp; of subieccyon that to hym shuld belonge / and sayde that these two sees were farre asonder, that is to meane Caunterbury and yorke / and that nother of them by the constytucyons of Gregory shulde be subiecte vnto other / but that the one is more worthy than the other, for so myche as he is of elder tyme. To thys answered Lamfranke and sayd / that ye constytucyons of Gregory made no mencyō of Caūterbury, but of yorke &amp; London. Than the pope remytted thys mater to be determyned before ye kyng &amp; the byshoppes of England / and gaue ye palle vnto Lamfranke.
                     But for this terme or word palle, is to many one vnknowen / I shall therfore here shewe vnto you what thynge it is. This palle is an indument y• euery archbyshop must haue / &amp; is not in full authoryte of an archbyshoppe, tyll he haue receyued hys palle of the pope / and is a thynge of white like to ye breded of a stole. But it is of a nother fassyon. For where ye stole is made in length, and is worne about the prestes necke / thys is ioyned togyder aboue, so that it lyeth a parte therof vppon the shulders. And that one ende hangeth streyght downe to the grounde before, and that other behynde, garnysshed in dyuers places, therof wyth crosses. And where the stole is worne nexte vnto the albe whan the preste is reuested to masse / thys palle is worne vpon thys vestymente ouermoste of all, whan an archebysshoppe syngeth hys masse.
                     whan Lamfranke had thus sped hys nedys at Rome / he wyth ye other two bysshoppes retourned into Englande / where thys mater hangyng in varyaunce bytwene the sayde two archebysshoppes, was had in cōmunycacion. For tryall wherof Bedaes story was brought forth▪ where in it appered, that from the fyrste Augu / styns tyme to Bedaes last dayes, vppon the season of a hundred &amp; .xxxix. yeres / the archbysshop of Caunterbury had prymacy of all the bysshoppes of England thā called Brytayn, and of Irlande also / and that the

archbyshoppes of Caunterbury had kept coūsayles nere vnto yorke, and cleped therunto the bysshoppes of yorke / and made some byshoppes, &amp; depryued dyuers from theyr dygnytyes / and to this were adioyned certayne pryuyleges, that were graunted for this maner of doynge.
                     when Thomas had harde all the allegacyons, he denyed all / and layd for hym the pystle, in the whych pope Gregorye demed that the chyrche of yorke and of London shulde be euen perys / and neyther of theym subiecte to other.
                     To this was answered by Lamfrank, that he was not byshop of Lō
                        don, nor this questyon was not moued for the chyrche of London.
                     But Thomas sayde that Gregory had graūted to Augustyne, power to haue vnder hym all ye byshoppes of Englande / and that London at ye day was the pryncypall see of all Englande. All be yt yt the popes mynde was, that betwene Lōdon and yorke shulde be no dyuersyte of honour, because they were archeflamynes / and that by theyr vnyte all other myghte ly
                           •
                        e vnder dewe obedyence. And though Augustyne chaunged ye see from London to Caunterbury / yet Gregory wolde not that Augustyne successours shuld be aboue the bysshoppes of yorke. For he wolde then haue set in hys epystle these wordes folowynge: I graunte to the Augustyne and to thy successours. But for he wold yt no such power shuld stretche to his successours / therefore he made no mēcyon of his successours.
                     Lamfranke to this answered and sayd, If that authoryte were graunted to Augustyne alone &amp; not to hys successours / yt was a symple gyfte yt the pope gaue vnto Augustyne, that was so famylyer wyth hym / and namely whyle Augustine ordeyned nor sacred no byshoppe of yorke whyle he lyued. For ye see was full durynge his lyfe / by reason wherof he put not hys authoryte in execucyon. But pryuyleges of popes confermeth this dignyte to Augustynes successours of Caunterbury / and demeth that yt is skyll and good reason, that all the chyrches of Englande shulde take lore and lyghte of that place. For of that welle or place proceded fyrst the doctrine of Cristes fayth. And where thou sayest Thomas, that Gregory myght yf he had wolde, haue confyrmed all thynge vndowtably wyth thys worde successours / that is soth. But yet the lackynge of this worde, dothe no preiudyce to the chyrche of Caunterbury. For when that Cryste sayde to Peter, I shall gyue to the the kayes of the kingdome of heuen / he myght haue also sayd yf he wold, I graunt the same power to thy successours. And though he sayde not so / yet he ment the successours of Peter, nothynge of reuerence nor yet of authoryte / but the dyspensacyon of holy chyrche and offyce of the same, was and is holy in theym, whyche onely spryngeth by vertue of Cryste into Peter, and from Peter into his successours. And yf thou can dyscerne betwene false and soth / loke what hath strength in all, hath strength in the parte / and what hath strength in the more, hath also strēgth in ye lesse. The chyrche of Rome is as yt were all of all chyrches / &amp; other chyrches ben as membres therof: lyke as one man is the kynd of all synguler men, and euery synguler man is the kynd of all mankynde: so in some maner of wyfe the chyrch and the see of Rome is as yt were the kynde, and conteyneth all, in comparyson to other chyrches / and yet in euery chyrch remayneth the full holenes of Crystes fayth. And also the chyrche of Rome

is greattest of all chirches / and what hath strength in that chyrche, shall haue strēgth in lesse chyrches / so that the power that is fyrste gyuen to euery chyrche, shall sprynge into the successours of the same / but yf yt be by some specyall thynge excepted &amp; out taken. Therfore I cōclude as Cryst sayde to Peter, so he sayde to all the byshoppes of Rome / and so consequētly was sayde to Augustynes successours of Gregorye, as was sayde vnto Augustyne. wherfore yt muste appere, that lyke as Caunterbury is subiecte to Rome, so muste yorke be subiecte to Caunterbury / whych sent to yorke prechours, to teache and preache vnto them the ryghte fayth. And where thou sayeste that Gregory wolde that Augustyne shuld haue his see at London, yt may not stand wyth reason. For who wolde trowe that so noble a discyple as Augustyn was / wold wythstande or do agayn hys maysters wyll, or agayne holy decrees. And yf yt were so as thou haste alledged / what is that to me, that am not bishop of London as oft before I haue sayd. Therfore yf this mater may thus sease wythout more stryfe / so be yt ended. And yf thou desyrest contynuaunce of plee / I shall not fayle the, but defende my ryghte and offyce gladly.
                     By these reasons &amp; other at length Thomas was ouercomen / and graūted gladly that the farther brynke of Humber shulde be the begynnyng of hys dioces. And ouer yt yt was there demed, that in all thynges concernynge the worshyppe of god and the fayth of holy chyrch / the archbyshop of yorke shuld be subiecte to the archbyshoppe of Caunterburye. So that yf the archebyshoppe of Caunterburye wolde call a coūsayll in any parte of Englande / the archebyshoppe of yorke shulde be therat, wyth all the byshoppes of hys prouynce / and be also obediēt vnto the lawfull hestes. And at all seasons when the archbysshop of Caunterbury shuld be sacred the archebyshoppe of yorke, with the byshoppes of ye chyrche, shulde come to Caūterbury and saker hym there. And yf the archebyshoppe of yorke shuld be stalled or sacred / thē shall he come to Caunterburye, and ellys where in all Englande, where the archebyshop of Caunterburye woll hym assygne, and there to be sacred of hym / and he shall make to hym an othe with professyon and obedyence.
                     when Lamfranke harde this iudgement gyuen thus / he reioysed inwardely. And for yt shulde remayne of recorde that his successours shuld not newely plede for that cause / he caused yt to be regestred in moste substancyall wyse. And ouer that sent a pystle for that cause to Alexander forenamed pope of all this doenge, wyth the professyon of Thomas the archbyshop foresayd. Of this Lamfrank is many notable thynges wryten of diuers writers. And after some he is admytted for a saynte.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXII. CHAPITER.
                     ABoute the .x. yere of kynge wyllyams reygne / Roger erle of Hereforde, by whose counsayl the kynge as before ys sayde hadde serched all the abbayes of England, whyche erle hadde wedded hys syster vnto Rauf erle of eest Angles / that is to saye, of Norf. and Suff, agayne the kynges mynde / he wyth the sayde Raufe made conspyracy agayne the kynge / &amp; caused an other erle by theyr subtyle meanes to be agreable vnto theyr vntrouth, whyche erle had to name walref. But at length when thys erle walref hadde knowen the fyne of theyr entent / he

went vnto Lamfranke, and shewed to hym the hole mater. By whose counsayll he shortely after sayled vnto the kyng then beynge in Normandye / and dysclosed the mater to hym, and putte hym holy in hys grace and mercye.
                     when the kynge had harde of these tydynges / he made good semblaunt vnto this erle walref, and sped hym the faster into Englande. But howe so yt was, the forenamed two erles were warned of dysclosynge of this mater / in such wyse yt they gaderyd to theym suche strength, that ye kyng coude not haue them at his pleasure, but as he was fayne by stronge hāde to chase and outlawe theym. And for he fayled of his purpose of them, he emprysoned erle walref at wynchester / and lastely caused hym to be hedded, more of tyranny, then of iustyce, as affermeth myne authoure / whose corps was buryed at the abbay of Crowlande.
                     In the .xi. yere was holden a great counsayll or synode of the clergye of the lande in saynt Paules chyrche of London / where amōges many thynges ordeyned for the rule of ye chyrch of England, dyuers byshoppes sees were transported from one place to another / as Selwey to Chychester, Kyrton̄ to Exeter, welles to Bathe, Shyrbourne to Salysbury, Dorchester to Lyncolne, and the see of Lychefelde to Chester. whyche thynges thus ordered, wyth many other for the chyrche / the sayde counsayll was dyssolued.
                     In the .xiii. yere of hys reygne / after the deth of Herman byshoppe of Salysbury, succeded Osmūde ye kynges chaunceller. The whyche buylded there a new chyrch / and brought thyther clerkes that were garnyshed wyth vertue and connynge. And he hym self wrote &amp; bounde bokes that were occupyed in the dyuyne seruyce of the chyrche, as the ordynall or consuetudynary, the whyche at this daye is occupyed in the more partye of Englande, wyth walys, and Irlande, and is nowe named Salysbury vse, or the ordynary after Salysbury vse.
                     In the .xv. yere of his reygne Robert the eldest sonne of kynge wyllyam, the whyche was surnamed Curthose or Shorthose and shorte bote also / for he myght not haue the duchy of Normandy, whych his father hadde somtyme assygned and gyuen vnto hym, and after for hys wyldenesse hadde agayne resumed yt / he wyth fauoure and ayde of ye French kynge Phylyppe and of Lewys hys sonne, toke prays in that duchy, and put hys father to myche trouble / in so myche that at length the father &amp; the sonne met in playne felde with .ii. great hostes / and eyther wyth other faught a cruell batayll.
                     It is radde that durynge thys batayll wyllyam was throwē from his horse, and in great ieopardy of hys lyfe. wherof hys sonne Robert beyng ware / was so moued wyth pytye, yt he rescowed his father, and delyuered hym free from all daunger of his enymyes. But howe so yt betyde of the kynge / trouth yt is that many of his men were slayn, &amp; his second son wyllyam the rede sore hurte, so that in the ende kynge wylliam was fayn to refuse the felde, and gatte at that tyme none aduauntage of his sayde sonne. For the whiche dede and rebellyon thus made by the sonne / ye fader accursed hym after the opynyon of some wryters.
                     whyle kyng wyllyam was thus occupyed in Normandy / the Northumbers waxte sterne &amp; rebell, and slewe in theyr rage walkerus the bishop of Durham / but for what cause myne

authour expressyth not.
                     Aboute thys tyme, warynge erle of Shrewesbury made two abbayes in the worshyp of god and saynte Mylborgh / wherof one was set in the suburbes of Shrewesbury, and ye other at wenioke.
                     In the .xvii. yere of kyng wyllyam / a cursed stryfe was arered betwene Thurstone abbot of Glastenbury a Norman, and his munkes. wherof a part of the cause was, that the abbot despysed, &amp; wold haue set a part such songe and offices, as by pope Gregory and Augustyn his dyscyple, of old tyme to them was assygned / &amp; wolde haue compelled them to haue folowed the vse of one wyllyā of Fescamp̄. And ouer that this Thurstone wasted and spēded the goodes of ye place inordynatly, in lechery and by other insolent meanes / and wythdrew frō the munkes theyr olde accustomed dyet. For the whyche causes fyrst beganne great wordes wyth chydyng, and after strokes and fyghtes / so yt the abbot gat vnto hym armed men, and fyll vppon hys munkes, &amp; slewe two of them at ye hygh alter, and woū
                        ded of theym .xviii. And the munkes wyth fourmes and candelstyckes defended theym, in suche wyse that they hurte many of the armed men. Then the complaynte was brought before the kyng / by whose iudgemēt Thurstone was agayne returned vnto Cadony frō whēs he was brought and the mūkes were spredde abrode into dyuers houses thorough Englande. But yt is sayde that in the tyme of wyllyā the Rede / this Thurston̄ obteyned the rule of that abbay agayne for the pryce of .v. hundred pounde.
                     In the .xix. yere of his reygne, kyng willyam then raysed a new maner of trybute. For he caused to be gadered thorough England of euery hyde of lande .vi. s̄. An hyde of lande conteyneth .v. yerdes / and euery yerde conteyneth foure acres. And so an hyde of lande conteyneth .xx. acres, an acre conteyneth .xl. perches in length and .iiii. in brede / &amp; .iiii. acres make a yerde / and .v. yerdes make an hyde / and .viii. hydes make a knightes fee. By the whyche reason a knyghtes fee shuld welde a hundred &amp; .lx. acres / and that is demed for a plough tyll a yere.
                     And not longe after he caused to be serchyd howe myche lande eche of hys barons helde / how many knyghtes fees / how many townes / &amp; what nombre of men and of bestes were wyth in this lande / wherof he commaunded a boke to be made, whyche all was done. For the whyche dede, this lande was after greued wyth many sondry plages as after shall appere. In the .xx. yere of the reygne of kynge wyllyam / Canutus kynge of Denmarke wyth helpe of the Flemmynges, to whome he was called wyth a great armye came towarde Englande. But by the prouysyon of the kynge they were so fered, that they were let of theyr iourney. Then kyng wyllyam gaue vnto .iii. of his champyons .iii. byshopryches. To Moryce he gaue London, to willyam he gaue Thetforde, and to Robert he gaue Chester / whych Robert was after remoued to Couentre. Of this Robert reporteth Ranulfe, that he scraped frō one beme of his chirch in Couentre .v. hūdred marke, to fyll wyth ye hande of kyng wyllyam.

sayled into Apulia.
                     Then beganne the forsayde plages to sprynge. For greate morayne fell vppon the brute bestes, and brennyng feuours amonges the people, and also great hūger and barreynes of ye erth. Also in this yere great hurt was done in many places of ye lande by fyre, and specyally in the cytye of London / where vpon the .vii. day of the moneth of Iulii sodayne fyre began, the whyche brent a great parte of the chyrche of saynte Paule, wyth also a great parte of the cytye.
                     Then kynge wyllyam beynge in Normandye was syke, and kept his

                        , and noryshed hys fatte wombe. The whyche wordes when they were blowen to kynge wyllyās crys, he was greuously dyscontent and sayde, when I am chyrched I shall offer to hym a thousande candellys lyghte, wyth the whyche he shall holde hym smally contented. The whyche promyse he after performed. For in the moneth of Iuly whē Corne, fruyt, and grapes were moste florishynge / he entred Fraunce with a great army / and sette on fyre many cytyes and townes in the west syde of Fraunce / and lastely came to the cytye of Meaus, and fyred yt &amp; brent a parte therof wyth the chyrch of our lady / wherin he brent a womā beyng closed in the walle of the sayd chyrch as a recluse.
                     But of this thynge speketh not the cronycle of Fraunce / Nor yet for the more parte of any thynge that soundeth to theyr dyshonour done vnto theym by Englyshemen.
                     In this hete, or as some wryters haue by ye lepyng of an horse / kyng wyllyam toke such a dysease or sykenes, that yt was the cause of hys deth. And when he felt hym thus greued / he called his sonnes before hym, and exhorted theym in his beste maner, that they shulde charytably loue and fauoure euery of them the other, and holde to gyder as louyng bretherne / &amp; after made his testamēt, and therin ordeyned wyllyam Ruffus or wyllyam the rede to be kynge of England. And Normandye he beset vnto Rober Curthose. And to Henry his yongest sonne he bequethed his treasour and mouable goodes. And that done he enfourmed hys two eldest sonnes of the dysposycyon of both peoples / and warned wyllyam to be louynge and lyberall to his subiectes, and Robert to be sterne and sturdy vnto his. Then he was moued with myldenes and delyueryd from prison hys own brother the byshop of Bayon, Marcharus erle of Northūberlande. wylnotus the sonne of Harolde, or after some the sonne of Goodwyne, that was sent to wyllyā by Edwarde the confessour to remayne for a pledge for his sayde fader Goodwyn. And shortely after these thynges wyth other done / he dyed in Normandye, and was buryed in ye cytye of Caan̄ / when he had reygned as kyng of Englande .xxi. yeres and vppon .x. monethes, in the moneth of Iuly, and the yere of hys duchery the .lii.
                     when wyllyam was dede / men spake of hym as they do of other prynces / and sayd that he was wyse and gylefull, ryche and couetous, &amp; loued well to be magnifyed and praysed / a fayre speker &amp; a greatr dyssymuler, a man of skylfull stature but somdeale fatte in the bely, sterne of face and stronge in armys, and therwyth bolde / and had therwyth great pleasure in huntyng and in makyng of great festes. But he passed al other in leuyenge of taskes. whyche condycyon hys subiectes construed .iii.

maner of wayes / and saydeyt was to the entente that he wolde excell all other in rychesse, or ellys for to withstāde and defende his enymyes, or ellys to staunche the appetyte of his couetyse mynde. He buylded .ii. abbayes in Englande / one at batayl in Sussex where he wanne the felde agayne Harolde, and is at thys daye called the abbay of Batail / &amp; ye other he sette besyde London vppon the south syde of Thamys, and named yt Barmoundesay. And in Normandye he buylded two also.
                     Thys man made the newe forest in the countrey of Southampton / the whyche to brynge aboute he caste downe dyuers chyrches by the space of .xxx. myles, and replenyshed yt wyth wylde bestes / and made harde and sharpe lawes for the encreasyng of them, as losyng of eyen and other. And he helde Englyshemen so lowe, that in hys dayes was almoste no Englyshe man that bare any offyce of honoure or rule. But yet somedeale he fauoured the cytye of London, and graunted to the cytezens the fyrste charter that euer they had / the whych is wryten in Saxon tunge, and sealed wyth grene waxe, and expressed in .viii. or .ix. lynes.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXIII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        Wyllyam Rufus or wyllyam the erede, the second sonne of wyllyam Conquerour / beganne hys reygne ouer Englande, in the moneth of Iulye, and the yere of our lorde a thousande &amp; .lxxxix / and the xxxi. yere of the fyrste Phylyppe then kynge of Fraunce.
                     Ranulfe monke of Chester sheweth in hys boke of Polycronycon, yt Robert Curthose eldest sonne of wyllyam Conquerour, was at the tyme of hys fathers deth absent. The whyche heryng that his father hadde preferred hys yonger brother to ye kyngdome of Englande, was therwyth greatly amoued / in so myche that he layde his dukedome to pledge to his brother Henry / and wyth that good gatheryd to him a stronge army, and so landed at Hampton̄.
                     wherof wyllyam hys brother beynge warned, in all haste sent vnto hym messangers / to whome he gaue cōmyssyon to say in maner as foloweth. Thy brother wyllyam prayeth yt to take no grefe with yt he hath done, for he clepeth hym selfe not kynge, but as vnder kynge to reygne vnder the, and by helpe of the that arte gretter then he &amp; better, &amp; rather borne. And yf thou consyder yt well, he hath nothynge mysused hym agayn the. For he hath taken vppon hym for a tyme bycause of thyne absence. But for he is nowe in authoryte by thy sufferaunce / he prayeth yt he may vnder the so contyue, payeng to the yerely .iii. thousande marke, wyth cōdycyon that who so ouer lyueth may enioye the kyngdome. when Robert had harde that message to the ende, he wagged hys hedde, as he that conceyued some doublenesse in thys reporte. But for he was lyberall and allowed more the honour then he dyd hys profyte, as in other thynges folowyng of his dedes yt shall appere / therfore he lyghtely assented to all that was desyred, and returned shortly after into Normandye wyth pleasaunt wordes wythout profyte.
                     Thys wyllyam was crowned the xxvii. daye of September, vppon the daye of saynte Cosma and Damyan, and was well ayded of Lamfrāk whyle he lyued. He was dyuers &amp; unstable of maners / so yt betwene hym &amp; his lordes was oftē dyssencyō. In ye spryngyng of somer folowyng

hys coronacyon / Odo byshoppe of Bayō, whych as before ye haue hard was delyuered out of pryson by wylliam Cōquerour, came into Englād. whom the kynge ioyously receyued / and gaue vnto hym shortly after the erledome of Kent. But he toke vppon hym in processe of tyme to rule, in suche wyse as the kynge grudged wyth hys doynge. And for thys the kynge and his sayde vncle fyll at vnkyndnesse / so yt he withdrew hym frō the kynge, and alyed hym wyth the byshop of Durham, the erles of Northūberland and Shrewesbury, with other.Confederacy. The whyche confederyd to gyder / toke partye agayne the kynge, and dyd thynges to his dyspleasure and hurte. And amonges other damages by theym done, Roger de Mount Gomoryk erle of Shrewesbury, destroyed the countrey and endes of England vnto worceter town wyth ayde of the walshemen. But in the ende thorough the prayer of the holy byshoppe wolstane / the walshemen were so weked and febled, that a few knyghtes scomfyted of them a great hoste.
                     when kyng wyllyam conceyued, ye well nere all the Normans toke partye agayne hym / he then forced of necessyte drewe to hym the Englyshemen. And fauoured them by giftes &amp; easy lawes / so that by theyr strength he lastely recouered the erle of Shrewesburye, and chased some other of hys enymyes / and shortely after occupyed the castell and strong holdes in Kent belongynge to byshop Odo hys forsayde vncle / and in the ende cōpelled hym to forswere England. And yt done he besyeged ye citie of Rochester, wherin the byshoppe of Durham, the erle of Northumberland, and other noble men were gadered / and wan yt at length by appoyntement, so that hys enymyes were vnto hym reconcyled.
                     In the thyrde yere of hys reygne dyed Lamfrank / when he hadde ben archbyshop of Caunterburye .xviii. yeres. By whose meanes the mōkes of Englande were brought to the vse of theyr holy relygyon / the whych before hys commynge lyued more lyke to seculer prestes thē religious men / and exercysed them in huntynge and hawkynge for to auoyde idelnesse, &amp; dysynge and cardynge in the wynter nyghtes, that they myght be redy to kepe theyr howres and nyghtly seruyce. And in theyr apparel they were lyke vnto consules and not vnto mū
                        kes, wyth many other deformytyes. The whych in ye begynnyng of Lamfrank / he of policye suffered for a season, lest he had brought all in his top atones, and therby myght haue caused some scysme or varyaūce to haue rysen in the chyrche. In auoydynge wherof wyth other inconuenyences / he lytell and lytell refrayned them of theyr outrage / and in ꝓcesse of tyme caused and constrayned them to lyue after the constitucyons and rules of theyr relygyon.
                     Aboute thys tyme, Robert Curthose duke of Normandy, entēdynge to take hys vyage into the holy lande / layde his dukedome to wedde to hys brother wyllyam for .x. thousande pounde. For leuyenge wherof kynge wyllyam set a taske vpon his commons and subiectes, and reysed a farre excidynge some vnder colour of the same / so that byshoppes melted theyr vessell, and lordes spoyled theyr tenauntes.
                     The kynge of Scottes also brake the peace before made with wyllyam Conquerour, and wasted and toke prayes ut the countrey of Northumberlande. Then the kynge prouyded a nauy and sayled thyther in the wynter tyme. But by ye tempest of the see,

halfe his nauy or a great parte of yt was drowned / and many of his knyghtes were loste for colde and hunger. But yet in the ende after dyuers conflyctes and bykerynges, by mediacyon of frendes a peace and vnyte was concluded / so that Malcolyn then kynge of Scottes shuld be obedyent to kynge wyllyam, vnder the same othe that he was before tyme sworne vnto hys father / and kynge willyam shuld yerely gyue vnto him in ye way of a fee .xii. markes of gold.
                     In the fourth yere of his reygne, and the fyft daye of October / passyng great tempest of wederyng fell in soudry places of Englande, and specyally in ye towne of wynchecome. For there by tempeste of thūder and lyghtenyng, a parte of ye steple of the chyrch was throwen downe / and the crycyfyx wyth the ymage of our lady also standynge vpon the roode lofte, was in lykewyse ouerthrowen and broke and shatered. And after folowed a contagye and a fowle stenche / ye whych endured tyll the munkes had gone in processyon about the chyrch, and all the houses adioynyng to that abbay and other places.
                     Also thys yere at Lōdon was great harme done by force of the wynde / which blewe with such violence yt yt ouerturned or ryued as wytnessyth Polycronycon, ouer the nōber of .vi. hundred houses. And ye rofe of saynt Mary Bow in chepe was also ryued wherwith two men were slayne. And also at Salesburye was hurte done wyth ye same wynde or ye lyke therof.
                     In the .v. yere of wyllyās reygne / he went into Northumberlande, and repayred suche holdes and castelles as the Scottes by theyr warrys had blemyshed and apayred / and caused a new castell to be made at Caercol ye cytye or towne, whych the Danys of two hundred yeres passed hadde destroyed. Then ye kyng returned vnto Gloucester / where he was greuously veryd wyth sykenesse, so that he wende he shulde haue dyed. In tyme wherof he toke great repentaunce, &amp; ꝓmysed yf he myght escape, he wold neuer sell mo benefices / &amp; ouer that he wold amēde hys lyuyng &amp; become a new mā. But after he was restored to helth, that promyse was shortely forgoten. And in that yere he gaue vnto Anselme the archbyshopryche of yorke. But he myghte take of yt but as the kynges pleasure was, tyll suche tyme as the kyng hadde taken his trybute therof. And more ouer he auouched, that the see of Lyncoln̄ be longed to the see of yorke / tyll the bisshoppe of Lyncolne had pleased him wyth a great summe of money, as .v. thousande marke after the wrytyng of Ranulfe.
                     In the .vi. yere of hys reygne were excedynge floodes, wherof the lyke in many yeres passed hadde not ben sene. And after that ensued wonderfull frost
                           •
                         / whych frose the great stremes in suche wyse, ye horse and carte passed ouer ye gret ryuers. And in the ende when the yse melted and brake / the payse therof brake many a stronge brydge, bothe of tymber and of stone.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXIIII. CHAPITER.
                     ABout thys tyme the welshemen with theyr kyng or duke named Rees, brake out vppon the Englyshmen in the Bordour, where standeth the castell of Brekenocke / and there made masteryes for a while. But in the ende his people were chaced and slayne / and he wounded to deth, so that he dyed the .iii. daye folowynge. Thys Rees is accompted of wryters, to be the laste kynge of walys. For after thys daye they

were so daūted / that kynges of Englande had them in suche rule, that they were vnder more stedfaste obedyence than they were before tyme. How be it they rebellyd full often as after shall appere.
                     And the yere folowyng kyng wyllyam to haue ye countrey in the more quyet / hewe downe mych of ye wood, and buylded in sundry places strong castels and pyles / by meane wherof more and more they were plucked to obedyēce. But not shortely after / but specyally in the dayes of Edwarde ye fyrste and Edwarde the thyrde.
                     Malcolyn kyng of Scotland came vnto Glowcester to comon wyth the kynge of dyuers maters, and to take a fynall agremēt. But for kyng wyllyam wolde haue demyd hym in hys courte / therfore Malcoline departed from the kynge in great dyspleasur. For the whyche and other causes, the warre bytwene England and Scotlande was reuyued / so that vppon saynt Bricius daye folowyng, Malcolyne wyth hys retynewe foughte wyth an erle named Robert and thā erle of Northumberlande / and there was slayne wyth hys eldest sonne Edwarde. For sorowe wherof Margaret quene of Scotlande and syster vnto Edgare Ethelynge, as in the fyrste chapyter of the story of wyllyā Conqueroure is shewed, dyed soone after. Than the Scottes made Dunwalde brother of Malcolyne theyr kynge, and put by hys sonnes. But by the ayde of kynge wyllyam / Edgare whyche of some wryters is named Dunkam, was made kynge, as eldest sonne of Malcolyne.
                     In the .vii. yere of the reygne of kynge wyllyam / Auncelyne or Anselme that was archbyshop of yorke, was remoued to Caunterbury as affermeth one cronycle. But Polycronycon and Guydo sayen, that Hugh erle of Chester beynge sycke and diseased / in the .vi. yere of wyllyam Rufus, sent into Normādy for Anselme than abbot of Barry for thre causes. The fyrste to vysyte and se hym, and to be reconcyled of hym, as the man that he moste trusted. The seconde cause was, that he shuld releue some abbays of Englande, that the kynge vexed wyth greuous trybutes. And the thyrd cause was, yt he shuld foūd an abbay at Chester / whych place he after buylded, &amp; made one Rycharde his chapleyne fyrst abbot of ye place / and sone after he was made archbysshop of Caunterbury. where by it appereth that the sayd see was voyde ouer the terme of thre yeres.
                     Thys sayd .vii. yere / Englande &amp; Normandye were greued wyth trybute and moreyne of men, so sharply that tyllynge of the erth was spared or putte of for that yere / &amp; there after ensued great hūger. Thys yere also ye Scottes slewe theyr kyng Edgar, and restored agayn to the rule of the lande the forenamed Dunwalde. And many grysly and vncouth syghtes were thys yere sene in England / as hostes of men fightyng in ye skye, and fyre lemys &amp; other. And the holy bysshop wolstone of worceter dyed soone after / of whom it is shewed yt he sondry tymes warned &amp; rebuked Englyshmen for theyr mysseliuyng / and sayd for theyr offenses they were so punysshed of the Normans. But the Englyshmen excused them selfe, and sayde that the Normans were worse in lyuynge than they. where vnto the byshop answered and sayd / that god vsed the wyckednesse of thē in Englyshmen. For by the Wycked punysshement. wycked he punysshed ye wycked. And so doth god suffer the deuyll to punysshe synners in hell / &amp; he hym selfe is punysshed wyth them.
                     Of thys wolstone it is radde, that

kynge wyllyam wold haue put hym from hys see, to the entente that he myghte put another into hys see. wherof thys holy man beynge warned / yode vnto the kynge and sayde to hym: I am enfourmed that thou wylte take from me, the whiche a better man thā thou arte gaue vnto me. wherfore of whom that I receyued so noble a gyfte, to hym wyll I gyue it agayn / and than take it from hym yf thou may. And whan he hadde so sayde to the kynge, he yode to the sepulture of Edward the confessoure / and after yt he had made his prayers there, he pytched hys crosse in ye marble stone that laye vppon the graue. But no man myghte plucke out the staffe, tyll wolston came thyther hym selfe and pulled it out at the kynges cōmaundement. wherfore the kynge seyng that maruayle / suffred hym to enioye hys benefyce styll.
                     In the .x. yere of willyam Rufus / stryfe and dyscencyon fell bytwene hym and Anselme bysshop of Caunterbury / for Anselme myght nat call hys synodys nor correcte the byshoppes, but as the kynge wolde. The kynge also chalenged the inuestiture of bysshoppes, and pylled the spyrytualtye and temporaltye with vnreasonable taskes &amp; trybutes / the which he spent vpon the towre of London, &amp; the makynge of westmynster hall. And ouer that the kynges seruauntes, greued and pylled englysshmen. vnreasonably. And to thys mysery was ioyned the vnsaceable couetous of Ranulphe that was somtyme chapelayne vnto wyllyam conquerour / the whyche was at thys day the kynges procuratour, and gadered hys taskes ouer all. He was so couetous and so euyll dysposed, that he wolde leuye .iii. taskys for two. He pylled the ryche, and bare downe the poore, and caused many men to lose theyr landes for smal causes / and therfore the kynge had hym in hys synguler fauoure. And by hys meanes byshoprykes were boughte and solde as playnly as other marchaundyses. For that tyme, clerkes vsed busshed and brayded heddys, longe tayled &amp; blasynge clothes, shynynge golden gyrdels / and rode wyth gylte spurres, wyth vsynge of dyuers other enormytees. All whyche vyces Anselme wolde haue corrected / but he lacked assystence of hys bretherne ye bysshoppes. For the whyche cause &amp; other he departed the londe. wherewyth the kyng beynge mysse contented / sente after hym suche persons as robbed and spoyled hym, and entreted hym in most cruell maner. For the whyche dede Raufe bysshoppe of Chychester blamed the kynge / and also rebuked all such bysshoppes as had refused the partye of Anselme, &amp; had fauoured the kynge in causes cō
                        cernynge the foresayde varyaunce. And forthermore he wythstode the kynge and hys offycers in takynge of fynes of prestes for cryme of fornicacyon. For whyche causes the kyng wyth the sayd Raufe was sore amoued and dyscontented / and opteyned such fauour, that he suspēded many chyrches of hys dyoses. But in the ende, Raufe demeaned hym in suche wyse that he hadde hys owne wyll / and his chyrches enlarged and freed that before were stopped wyth thornes. And the kynge gaue vnto hym ye fynes of prestes within his dyosis / and endued ye see of Chychester with many greate gyftes.
                     And vpon a tyme kynge wyllyam was rydynge towarde hys dysporte of huntynge / and sodeynly a messenger came vnto hym and sayde, that the cytye of Cenemonia in Normandye was beseyged. wherfore he wythout longe taryenge or aduysement,

toke the streyght way to these syde / and sent to hys lordes, chargynge them to folow. whan the sayd lordes came to hys presence / they aduysed hym to tarye tyll his people were assembled. But he wolde nothynge do after theyr counsayle / but sayd, such as hym loued, he shortely wyste well wolde folowe hym, and so yode to shyp, settyng aparte all parels. The mayster of the shyp was afrayde, he sawe the weder so darke &amp; so clowdy / and counceyled the kynge to tary tyll the wynde wolde blowe more fauorably. But he commaunded hym to make all the spede that he cowde vpon hys lyfe / sayenge that he neuer harde that euer any kyng was drowned. And so he passed the see and landed in Normandy / and gathered to hym there hys knyghtes. whan the capytayne of the syege, whose name was Helyas, knewe of the kynges landyng / he fered, and anone began to breke the syege. But by treason he was taken and brought to the kynges presence. To whom the kynge shewed suche pytye, that he suffered hym to be at hys lybertye. whyche after the opynyon of wyllyam de regibus, was done more of pryde than of compassyon.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXV. CHAPITER.
                     IN the .xi. yere of the reygne of thys wyllyam the rede / at a towne called Fynchanster in the coūtrey of Barke shyre, a welle caste out blode as before it hadde done water. And after by the space of .xv. dayes, great flames of fyre were sene in the elemēt in sundry places and tymes. Thys yere also ye two erles of Shrewesbury and of Chester eyther named Hugh / by the kynges commaū
                        dement entred wyth theyr knyghtes the ile of Man or Anglesaye, &amp; slewe therin many welshemen, and gelded many moo. Amonge the whyche a preste named Kynredus was drawē out of a chyrch and serued of ye same wyse / and also cut hys tunge out of hys hed, and put out hys one eye. But this preste was of such vertue, that by myracle he was restored to helthe within .iii. dayes ensuynge.
                     In the whyche season and tyme, the kynge of Northganys or Norwaye wan the iles called than Orcades and now Orkeys / &amp; after came wyth hys strength into the foresayd ile of Man, where at the same season were the sayde two erles. Than bytwene them was mortall fyght / in ye whyche Hugh erle of Shrewesbury was stryken with an arowe in ye eye, and dyed wythin .viii. dayes after. But as sayth Guydo, the Danys were chased, and the Englysshemen hadde the vyctory.
                     Kyng wylliam was mych in Normandye / for so myche as Robert his brother was all thys season in the holy land / of whose actes shall some deale be towched in ye story of Henry the fyrste. And wyllyam had myche payne to rule the Normans / for they rebelled often agayne hym.
                     In the .xii. yere of hys reygne / he came out of Normandye, and when he saw the hall of westmynster yt he had caused to be buylded / he was therwyth dyscontented, that it was so lytell. wherfore as it is rehersed of some wryters / he entended yf he had lyued to haue made a larger, and yt to haue serued for a chaumber.
                     Robert Losaunge, that somtyme had ben abbot of Ramsey, and than bysshop of Thetforde by gyfte of a thousand pounde to the kyng / repented hym after, and bewept that vnskylfull dede / and toke hys waye to Rome, and dyd for it hys enioyned penaunce / and after retorned into

Englande, and turned hys see from Thetforde to Norwyche / &amp; founded there a fayre monastery of hys owne goodes, &amp; not of the patrymony of crystes chyrch. But therin is a dowt to consyder. For he was fyrste an abbot and after a bysshop.
                     About thys tyme, by the meanes of one Stephen Hardynge a munke of Sherbourne / an Englyshman of ye order of Sisteaux or whyte mūkes had hys begynnynge in the wyldernesse of Cystery within the prouynce of Burgoyne, as wytnesseth Ranulf munke of Chester. But other wryters, as Jacobus Phylyppus, &amp; the authour of Cronica cronicarū, Matheolus, wyth other / sayen that this Stephen was the second abbot of ye place / &amp; yt it was fyrste foūded by the meanes of one Robert abbot of Molynēse, in the yere of grace .M.xcviii. whyche to folow theyr sayeng, shuld be in the .ix. yere of the reygne of this kyng. This order was after brought into Englande by one called walter Espeke, that foūded the fyrste abbay of that relygyon at Ryuall, about ye yere of grace .xi.C.xxxi. The whyche shulde be about the .xxxi. yere of the fyrste Henry than kyng of England. Somwhat of theyr relygyon is towched in the .x. chapyter of the .viii. boke of Polycronycon.
                     After that kynge wyllyam, as before is sayde, was retourned out of Normandy / many wonderfull prodygyes and tokyns were shewed in England / as the swellyng or rysyng of ye water of Thamys, in suche wyse that it drowned dyuers townes, and dyd mych harme by out passyng his boundys in dyuers places about Lō
                        don and ellys where. Also the deuyll was sene walke in mannes lykenesse wyth dyuers other thynges whyche I ouerpasse. The kyng was warned of this, and tolde by his famylyers yt god was not cōtent with his lyuing. But he set all at nought, and made of it a scoffe or a iape.
                     In the .xiii. yere of his reygne and begynnynge thereof, as the thyrde daye of Auguste after the sayenge of Ranulfe / thys kyng wyllyam beyng at hys dysporte of huntynge wythin the newe forest, by glaunsynge of an arowe shot of a knyght named walter Tyrell, was wounded to the deth in the .xliiii. yere of hys age. After whyche dede the sayde walter escaped and saued hym self, for few there were that hym pursued. And so the kynge thus wounded, was layde vppon an horse lytter, and so conueyed to wynchester / where shortly after he dyed and was buryed.
                     Of this man myghte be made a myche lenger story, yf all hys dedes shulde be towched. The whych toke vpon hym great thynges / and mych gretter entēded yf he myght haue lyued. The daye before he was slayne one axed of hym where he wold kepe hys Crystmasse. At Poytiers sayde the kynge / for the erle entendeth to go towarde Hierusalem / and I woll assaye to haue hys erledome in morgage / for well I knowe he must cheuyche for money to perfourme that iourney. The day that wyllyā dyed / he helde in his hādes the .iii. bysshopryches / of Caūterbury, of winchester and of Salysbury / and dyuers abbayes, of the whyche he let some to terme. Also he refrayned y• money y• of olde tyme was payed to Rome called Rome scotte.Roma scotte. Of this wyllyā reportyth Henry of Hūtyngdō / &amp; sayth yt though this mā were lyght of som thynges, yet he was stedfast &amp; stable of his promyse / so yt what he ꝓmysed good or euyll shuld be ꝑformed. And though he were named couetous / yet it shuld seme yt he was liberall, as sheweth by this narracyō folowyng.
                     
                        Upon a season when the abbot of a place in Englande was dede / two munkes of the same place, the which before hadde gatheryd money, made theyr frendes to kynge willyam / and offered large offers eyther of them to be promoted to that dygnyte. There was also a thyrde munke, the which of mekenesse &amp; of humylyte folowed the other two / to the entent that vppon hym that the kynge had admytted for abbot, he wolde haue gyuen attendaunce, and as his chapelayn to haue wyth hym returned. The kynge called before hym the .ii. munkys seuerally, and eyther out profered other. And as he caste hys eye asyde / he espyed the thyrd, the whych he demed hadde comen also for the same cause. Then the kynge called hym / and asked yf he wold geue any more then his bretherne had offered, to be abbot. But he answered to the kynge and sayde, that he wolde nother offer nor yet gyue for yt one peny / nor wold haue so great a charge by any meane wrongefull. when the kynge had well vnderstanden thys thyrde munkes answere / he sayde that he was best worthy to be abbot, and to haue the rule of so holy a charge / and so he gaue vnto hym that benefyce, wythout takynge any peny. Thys kynge wyllyam vsed alway lemmans / wherfore he dyed without yssue legyttymat, when he had reyned as before is sayde fully .xii. yeres and odde dayes.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXVI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        HEnry the .iii. son of wyllyam Cō
                        querour &amp; fyrste of yt name, whyche for his connynge was surnamed beuclerk began hys reygne and domynyon as kynge of Englande, the .v. daye of August, in the yere of our lorde .xi. hundred &amp; one / and the .xliii. yere of the fyrste Phylyppe then kynge of Fraunce / &amp; was crowned at westmynster ryght shortly after, of Thomas archebyshoppe of yorke, and Morys byshoppe of London.
                     This Henry in his youth plyed him to such studye, that he was instructe in the .vii. artes lyberall. Anon he made holy chyrche free / &amp; vsed saynt Edwardes lawes, wyth the amendemēt of them. He put out of his courte nyce and wāton men / and closed Ranulphe byshoppe of Durham in the towre of Lōdon, ye which as ye before haue harde was so great wyth wyllyam his brother / and sent for Anselme archebyshoppe of Caunterburye, whyche before was fledde fro the tyranny of wyllyam Rufus.
                     
                        Iustyce and cōtynence. This Henry chastysed the olde vntrewe mesure, and made a yerde of ye length of hys owne arme / wyth dyuers other thynges reformyng, that longe before his days had ben mysse vsed / and abhorred excesse of metys and drynkes / &amp; vsed to fyght more wyth coūsayll then wyth sworde.
                     In the seconde yere of his reygne / Robert hys brother, that by all thys season hadde ben occupyed in warres vppon Cristes enymyes, hauyng worde of the deth of hys brother wyllyam, and howe his brother Henry hadde taken vpon hym as kynge / returned into Normandy, and there made preparacyon for to come into Englande.
                     In this season also was brokē out of pryson Ranulfe byshoppe of Durham, and comen to the sayde Robert into Normandy. The whych excyted duke Robert in all that he myght to warre vppon hys brother Henry / so that he assembled a stronge armye of

knyghtes, and toke shyppynge, and landed in processe of tyme at Portysmouth. But by medyacyon a peace was made / and that in suche condycion, that he shuld haue .iii. thousand markes yerely, as before was promysed vnto hym by willyam Rufus his brother wyth other condycyons of successyon and other thynges, the whyche I ouerpasse for length of tyme. Thus Robert beynge contented contrary to the myndes of his lordes, after he a season hadde dysported hym in Englande retourned into Normandy / where of his lordes he was for thys &amp; other dedes before done as after is shewed, lytle or lesse and lesse setby. For all be yt that by hys fathers lyfe he hadde vyctorye, and vtterly dyspleased hym as some deale before ys touched / yet by hys manhode and manfull dedes, he fell into the fauoure of the people, and dyd many and great notable actes / and specyally at the wynnyng of the cytye of Acon vppon the myscreauntes and turkes. For the whyche dedes yt apperyth by the sequele of the storye that he was also in the fauour of god. For when the eleccyon shuld be made for the kynge of Hierusalem, and certayne prynces and prynces peeres by ordynaunce made, stode wyth theyr tapers abydynge the dyuyne purueyaunce, that whose taper were fyrst wyth heuenly fyre lyghtened shulde be admytted for kynge / the taper of thys duke Robert was fyrste onely. wherfore by dyuyne purueyaunce he was then chosen kynge of Hierusalem. The whyche he refused, for the payne and trauayle that he shuld haue wyth all / &amp; also for the couetyse of the crowne of Englande. For as soone as he hadde knowlege of the deth of his brother willyam / anon he parted the coūtrey and sped hym homewarde in all that he myght. For the whych dede as affermeth myne authour, he spedde the worse in all his dedes after.
                     Thys Robert was wyse in counsayll, stronge in batayll, and also ryght lyberall / and in hys retourne from Hierusalem, maryed the doughter of wyllyam de Auersana lorde of Apulia, wyth whome he receyued grete sōmes of money for her dower, the whych by meane of his liberalyte he spent shortly after. Then fortune beganne to frowne vppon duke Robert / and sette his owne lordes so agayn hym, that they sent vnto kyng Henry hys brother / wyllynge hym to come into Normandye, and they wolde delyuer the coūtrey vnto him, and holde hym for theyr chefe lorde and ruler. wherunto, as sayth the englyshe cronycle, kynge Henry soone cōsented. But or euer thys warre betwene the sayde duke Robert &amp; kyng Henry beganne / thys Henry maryed Mawde or Molde the doughter of Malcolyne kyng of Scotlande, and of Margarete hys wyfe doughter of Edwarde the outlawe, as in the begynnyng of wyllyam Conqueroure is thouched. Of the whyche Molde thys Henry receyuyd after some wryters two sonnes and .ii. doughters / yt is to saye wyllyam and Rycharde, Mawde &amp; Mary. And also the sayd authour wyth other saye / that Robert duke of Normandye came into Englande in the fourth yere of the reygne of kynge Henry, and hadde good chere of his brother and syster. For the which he at the request of his sayde syster, released to his brother ye forenamed trybute of .iii. thousand markes. But by yll tale tellers &amp; couetous of signory, this broderly loue was after dissolued / in such wise that the kynge with a strong army sayled into Normandy / and held his broder Robert with so sharpe warre, that he

chased hym from one countrey to another / and wanne from hym Roan, Caan, Faloys, and all the good townes of Normandye / and lastely constrayned hym to aske helpe of Phylyppe kyng of Fraunce, &amp; after of the erle of Flaūdres / but he fayled helpe of them both. Then wyth such power as he could make, he gaue batayll vnto his brother kynge Henry. In the whyche he was taken, and sent ouer into England, and put into the castell of Cardyffe in walys / where he remayned as prisoner whyle he lyued. And when he was dede he was buryed at Glowcester.
                     In this tyme and season, as it were in ye .iii. yere of kyng Henry / ye chyrch of saynt Barthelmew in Smythfeld of London was begonne to be founded, of a mynstrell of this kyng Henry named Rayer / and after perfourmed and ended by good and well disposed cytezens of the citye of Lōdon. This place of Smythfelde was at ye day a lay stowe of al ordure or fylth, and the place where felons and other transgressours of the kynges lawes were put to execucyon.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXVII. CHAPITER.
                     SO as kynge Henry hadde fynyshed his warre in Normandye, &amp; was returned into Englande / Robert de Bolesyn, which was the eldest sonne of Roger de mount Gomeryk erle of Shrewesburye / arose agayne the kynge, and manned his castellys of Shrewesbury, of Brugg
                           •
                         of Arundell, and of Tekynhyll, and incoraged the walshmen agayne the kyng. But the kyng pursued so cruelly the sayd Robert, yt wythin .xl. days he wan all thoses castellis &amp; slew many of his men, and gat the fauour of the walshmen by gyftes and plesaūt wordes / and also compelled the sayd Robert to forsake Englād, The whyche then sayled into a corner of Normādye &amp; kept him there secretely, tyll such tyme as to hym was thyther comen willyā erle of Cornewall / which wyllyam was also erle of Nortom in Normandye. when these two erles were assocyat / they gaderyd to them a great strength of Normans, &amp; dyd great harme wythin the prouynce. wherfore the kynge sayled thyther &amp; made sharpe warre vppon them. In the whych he loste many of his men. But in ye ende he put frō them theyr strength, and toke theym both prysoners, and so helde them ye terme of theyr lyues. And that done, he sette that coūtrey in good reste and peace, and after retourned into Englande. After whyche returne / kynge Henry made sharpe lawes agayne theues and other that vsed vnleful meanes. In whyche lawes was conteyned losynge of lyfe, of eyes, of stones, and other members of man as the gylte requyred.
                     And soone after Anselme archbysshoppe of Caunterbury, assembled a great coūsayll at London of the clergy of England. By authoryte of the which coūsayll / dyuers abbotes and other were put from theyr dygnytie, for that they had taken before tyme theyr abbayes by vnlefull meanes. Prestes wyues And amōges all other decrees one was, ye prestes shulde forgo theyr wyues. Then strife fell betwen ye kyng &amp; Anselme / for that that he wold not sacre the prestes that hadde taken inuestyture of lewde mennys handes, whyche before was forboden vppon payne of cursynge. But Gyralde archebyshoppe of yorke / for the pleasure of the kynge sacred suche bysshoppes. wherfore Anselme beynge dyscōtent / departed ye land and yode to Rome, to shewe thys wyth other thynges to the pope, whyche at that

daye by moste accorde of wryters shulde be Pascall the seconde.
                     In the .vi. of the kynge, the countrey of Flaūdres was sore blemyshed and hurte by meane of the see, so that the Flemynges yode aboute to haue socoure of dwellynge, and requyred of the kyng to haue lycence that they might inhabyt them in the eest parte of the ryuer of Twede, the whych to them was graunted. But after a certayn of yeres they were remoued ito westwalys, where they remayned a longe whyle / but after they sprad all Englande ouer.
                     In the .vii. yere of thys kynge / vppon a frydaye at nyghte in the fyrste weke of clene lent, was sene an vncouth starre betwene ye south and the weste, the whyche nyghtely appered at one howre, and cōtynued so by the space of .xxv. days. And fore agaynst that oute of the eest parte / appered a great leuyn or beme of bryghtnes, whyche stretched towarde the sayde starre.
                     And vppon shere thursdaye nexte ensuynge, were sene two monys / that one in the eest, and that other in the weste.
                     And in thys yere / Anselme by the kynges agrement, returned agayne from Rome / and shortely after called a conuocacyon at London. In the whyche by the popes authoryte yt was newely conformed and enacted, that no temporall man after that daye shuld make inuesture with crosse or wyth rynge.
                     In the .viii. yere of the reygne of kynge Henry / the fourth Henry emperour of Almayne, the whyche had maryed Molde the eldeste doughter of kynge Henry, when she was of the age of .v. yeres / prysoned pope Pascall and dyuerse of the cardynallys. This Henry also warred agayne his father Henry the .iii / and lastely caste hym in stronge pryson. For the whyche dede as assermeth Ranulphe / he wylfully when he had ruled the empyre .xx. yere / resygned hys dygnyte into the handes of Calixtus ye secōde of that name then pope / &amp; after came secretely into England, &amp; vnto Chester, vnwyttynge hys wyfe or any of hys frendes / where he lyued longe after a strayte lyfe, and was buryed there at laste. But to this sayeng dysagreeth the wryters of the storyes of emperours. For of them yt is wytnessed / that this Henry the emperour after he had ruled the empyre as before is sayd .xx. wynter, he dyed at a place in Almayn called Spyre / and there was buryed, wyth this scrypture vppon his toumbe.
Filius hic, pater hic, auus hic, preauus iacet hic.
                     
                     whyche is to meane in our vulgare tunge as foloweth.

                           The son here lyeth, with also ye fader
                           The belsyre, for &amp; ye great graūfader.
                        
                     
                     when Henry the emperour was thus dede as after yt shalbe shewed, when conuenyency of tyme requyreth / what became of his wife it shall there be declared.
                     In the .ix. yere of ye reygne of kyng Henry / the archebyshoppe Anselme professed Gerarde archbyshoppe of yorke to the yoke of hys obedyence, as he was before taught by the lore of Lamfranke his predecessour. And the .x. daye of Auguste folowynge, he sacred .v. byshoppes at one tyme / as of wynchester; of Salysbury, of Exeter, of Herforde, and of Glamurgan. And kynge Henry ordeyned a byshoppes see at Ely / and ordeyned there Henry that hadde ben bishoppe of Bangor / and besette Cambrydge
                           •
                        shyre to the see of Ely. And to the bisshoppes see of Lyncolne, he gaue his owne towne of Spaldynge, for he hadde mynyshed that see by the preferment of Ely.
                     
                        In the .x. yere dyed Anselme archbyshop of Caunterbury. After whose deth that see was voyde .v. yeres / &amp; the goodes of the chyrch spent to the kynges vse. And whē he was prayed to helpe ye chyrch, that was wythout an hedde and a pastor / he vsed to answere that his fader and also his brother had accustomed, to set there the beste proued men yt they might fynd. And to the entente that he myght do the same / he toke the more tyme &amp; laysure. wyth suche mylde answeres he so put of the tyme, that be fylled hys cofers wyth the great sommes of ye benefyce. And who that is desyrous to knowe of the great vertue of thys byshoppe Anselme / lette hym rede in the .xiiii. chapyter of the .vii. boke of Polycronycon; &amp; there he shall fynde a parte therof.
                     About this tyme as wytnesseth the frenche cronycle / a cōtrauersy began betwene the kyng and Lewys kyng of Fraunce son to Phylyp the fyrste. This Lewys was surnamed Lewis the great, other for hys bygnesse of person, or ellys for greatnesse of hys dedes. This Lewys sent vnto kyng Henry beynge in Normandy / &amp; gaue vnto hym monycyon of homage for the duchy of Normandy / &amp; also that he shulde restore vnto hym or bete down to the groūde, the castell of Gysours / &amp; also to recompence and restore for hurtes and harmes that his Normans hadde done in those partes. But all this of kyng Henry was denyed / and shortely after skyrmysshes and cocke fyghtes beganne betwene the sayde two prynces, kynge Henry lyenge at the sayde castell of Gysours, and Lewys at a place called mounte Calue. But thys encreased in suche wyse, that after eyther prynce soughte more rome places, whose knyghtes sundry tymes met. But of any notable batayll I fynde no remembraunce / all be yt that the sayde warre contynued by the terme of two yeres. In the ende of whych two yeres wyllyam the eldest sonne of kynge Henry, beynge a chyld and wythin age / contented so well the mynde of Lewys, that he refrayned of hys warre for that tyme.
                     In the .xiii. yere, at Shrewesburye was a great erth quake, and at Nothyngham from the morne to the vndertyde. The ryuer of Trent was so fordryed in the moneth of June, as sayth Guydo, that men wente ouer drye. And the starre called stella cometa or the blasynge sterre aperyde soone after. Theruppon folowed an harde wynter, great deth of the people, and scarcete of vitayll by the great moreyn of bestes. In thys yere also the kynge founded the abbay of Hyde wythoute the wallys of wynchester, that of olde tyme was wythin the wallys.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXVIII. CHAPITER.
                     IN the .xv. yere of hys reygne / ye kynge entēdyd to haue 
                           •
                        moted Faricus abbot of Abyndon, vnto the see of Caunterburye. But by a counsayll kept at wyndesoure of bysshoppes, ye kynges mynde was chaū
                        ged / and to that see was then admytted Raufe that was byshoppe of Rochester. And the same yere one Thurstone was chosen archebyshoppe of yorke / the whyche wythsayde hys professyon of obedience that he shuld owe to the see of Caunterbury / wherfore at lengthe he was depryuyd of hys dygnyte. But after by laboure that he made to Pascall the pope before named / the sayde pope wrote vnto the kynge that he shulde restore Thurstone agayne to the see of yorke. By whyche meane he was agayne restoryd / but yet he disdayned

to do hys lawefull obedyence vnto Raufe archebyshope of Caunterbury. Then the stryfe was renewed, which Lamfranke before as ye haue harde in the thyrde chapyter of wyllyam Conquerour, dyd appeace / and was brought in argument before the pope. The whyche at the kynges request, promysed yt he wolde nothyng do nor ordeyne, that shuld be derogacion to the archbyshop of Caunterbury, or to the dygnyte of his chyrche. But in cōclusion the pope gaue such a defuse sentence in thys mater, that he lefte the stryfe vndetermyned and vnassoyled. And when ye kynges procuratours wyth also the archbyshop of Caunterbury were absent / were yt for nede or for fauour, the pope was so bowed, that he forsoke ye olde rule vsed before hys days, and sacred the sayde Thurstone, and gaue vnto hym the pawle. For this dede ye kyng was sore dyscontented wyth Thurstone, and warned hym the entre of his lande. wherfore the pope wrote after shortely to the kynge / wyllyng hym to suffer Thurstone to occupye his see peaseably, or he shulde be accused and suspended by the dygnyte of the offyce of Caunterbury / and so Thurstone enioyed his see.
                     In the yere of our lorde .xi. hundred &amp; .xviii. as sayth the frenche cronicle, whyche was the .xvii. yere of thys kyng Henry the fyrst / the warre was agayn quyckened betwen kyng Henry and Lewys kynge of Fraunce. wherof was the occasyon, as sayth the sayde frenche cronycle, Thybaude erle of Chartres. whych Thybaude was greuyd by the Frenche kynge, and for necessyte requyred kynge Henry of ayde and helpe, to whome the kynge as to hys kynnesman sent ayde and socoure. And afterwarde the kynge sayled ouer with a stronge armye / and sente a nobleman named Stephan into the lordshyppe of Brye, to defendeyt agayn the Frenche kynge. when Lewys vnsterstode that kynge Henry was landed in Normandye wyth so great power / he in all haste assembled a stronge power, and drewe hym towarde the kynge. But there were so stronge holdes mannyd wyth Normans, &amp; also such depe and great ryuers / that the Frenche kynge myght not wynne vnto kynge Henry. Then lastely by a feate of warre whyche were longe to reherse, he wan a town named Lyngues in Cause / in the whyche towne was a brydge to passe the ryuer of Thee, and so into Normandye.
                     when a certayne of the knyghtes of Lewes had thus wonne the foresayd towne / the sayd Lewes wyth his people spedde hym shortly after, and rescued his foresayde knightes / &amp; then spoyled and robbed the towne the whyche was ryche, for so myche as yt hadde ben in quyet and rest many yeres before. He also slewe and toke prysoners all ye Normans there dwellyng, &amp; put in theyr stede Frenchmē. And that done he sped hym towarde kynge Henry, the which was at a castell called Male assyse / &amp; there made purueyaunce for the defence of the Frenchmen. And when he hadde garnyshed yt to hys pleasure he departed thens. But not longe after the Frenche kynge came thyther wyth his hole hoste of Frenchmen / and after many sore &amp; cruell assautys, wan the sayde castell / and bette yt downe euen wyth the grounde. After whych season as sayth the sayd cronicle, fell to the Frenche kynge many and dyuerse mysfortunes. For shortely after amonge other myssechaunces / a noble captayn of hys named Angueran de Chanmount, the whyche had done myche harme in Normandye

to kynge Henry, and wonne there some castelles and other stronge holdes, dyed sodeynly. And in shorte tyme after / Baldewyne erle of Flaūdres a man of great strēgth and puyssaunce, as he beseaged a castell was wounded in the face, and dyed wyth in .vi. dayes after. Then Fauques erle of Aungeos, in whom also this Lewys affyed mych and trusted / maryed his doughter vnto willyam the eldest sonne of kynge Henry / and refused the kynge of Fraunce parte, and ayded and assysted kynge Henry in all that he myght / so that dayly the power of kyng Henry encreased, and the Frenche kynges mynyshed. Lastely these two prynces met wyth theyr both hostes in playne feld, and foughte a dedely and cruell batayll. where in the ende the Frenche kynge was ouercomen, and loste myche of his people / and was cōpelled to flee vnto a place called Audely for his sauegarde. But thys ouerthrowe of Frenchemen is excused in the moste fayrest maner / so yt they excuse them selfe, and saye that kynge Henry set vppon kynge Lewys, when he was not ware, but hys knyghtes all oute of aray &amp; order, and also kyng Henry had farre excedynge nomber of men ouer that theyr kyng had / with other wordes of boste of them selfe, &amp; slaunder of Englyshemen, the whyche as to me appereth is an augmentacyon of theyr owne shame. But Ranulfe the munke sayth shortely, that kyng Henry ouercame the Frenche kynge royally in batayll.
                     Then yt foloweth in ye story / fynally these sayde prynces were agreed / and wyllyam the sonne of kyng Henry dyd homage vnto ye French kyng for the landes of Normandye, by the agrement of his fader. For the kyng thought hym selfe to good to be vnder the obeysaūce of ye Frenche kyng Then kynge Henry caused hys free men of Englande and of Normandy, to do homage vnto his sonne wyllyam.
                     And soone after Fouques before named lefte hys erledome of Angeer or Angiers, in guydyng of kynge Henry, and yode hym selfe into the holy lande / and wylled in his testament, that yf he retourned not agayne, that the sayde erledome shulde remayne vnto his sonne in lawe wyllyam, son of kynge Henry, whyche hadde maryed hys doughter.
                     About the .xx. yere of the reygne of kyng Henry / quene Molde or Mawde hys wyfe dyed in Normandy / the whyche in her youthe was set by her father kyng of Scottes into a nunry, and there ware &amp; vsed the vayle and habyte of a nunne. For the whiche cause when kynge Henry was agreable to take her vnto wyfe, thys mater fell in great despucyon / &amp; Anselme then archebyshop of Caunterbury was sore agayne that maryage a season of tyme. But at length yt was suffycyētly proued that she was there as a fygure, a woman worynge that habyte wythoute professyon of order. And this was thus ordered by her father, to the ende to put by vnworthy wowers. Thys of wryters was reputed for a blessyd and holy woman, after the lyuynge of a worldly woman.
                     when kynge Henry had contynued in Normandy vppon the season and terme of .iii. yeres / he toke shyppyng at Haterflete in Normandy, and sayled happely into Englande the same day, that is to meane ye .xxiiii. day of Nouember as sayth some wryters. And shortly after willyā duke of Normandy, wyth Rycharde his brother, Notha the countesse of Persye, Rycharde erle of Chester, with his wyfe the kynges nyce, and the archdekyn

of Herforde and other, to the nomber of a hundred &amp; .lx. persones / toke shyppynge at the sayde porte, &amp; were all drowned, a bocher onely excepte. whyche mysfortune fell by the ouersyght of the maister and other, which fell at a dyssencyon in the nyghte amonge them selfe / by reason wherof they ranne vppon a rocke as shewed the foresayde bocher. From this daūger wyllyam duke of Normādy was escaped, and was in the shyppe bote nere vnto the lande. But when he harde the lamētable crye of the Coū
                        tesse Notha / he commaunded the rowers to returne and saue the sayd Countesse. whych done by what mysfortune I can not saye, after she was receyued into the bote, were it by tempeste or ouer chargynge of the bote or otherwise / they were all swalowid of the see, so that none of them was after foūde but ꝑte of theyr goodes. Of this duke wyllyā some desclaunderous wordes are lefte in memory, both in the englyshe cronycle and also of other wryters / the whyche I ouerpasse.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXIX. CHAPITER.
                     IN the .xxi. yere of hys reygne / kynge Henry made ye parke of wodestoke be syde Oxenforde, with other plesures to the same. And Fouques erle of Angiers returned out of the holy land, and maryed the syster of her that before he had maryed vnto wyllam duke of Normandye, vnto the son of Robert Curthose / and gaue wyth her the erledome of Conomanna. And stryfe began to kyndell betwene kynge Henry &amp; the sayd Fouques, for the wytholdyng of the dowre or ioynture of hys fyrste doughter, maryed wnto wyllyam the kynges sonne.
                     In the .xxiii. yere of kynge Henry, dyed Raufe archbyshoppe of Caunterbury / and one named wyllyā was set in ye see after hym. And the kynge in thys yere beganne the foundacyon of ye abbay of Redyng. And Iohn̄ a cardynall of Rome was sente from Calyxte the seconde of that name thē beynge pope, for certayne maters cō
                        cernynge the pope. In the tyme of whyche hys so beynge here, the cardynall made sharpe processe agayne prestes that norysshed Crysten moyles / and rebuked them by open publyshement and otherwyse, so that he wan hym here but small &amp; lytle fauoure. But this dyssymuled doctour toke so great feruence in the correccyon of the iudgement of prestes of Englande, that he forgate the lore and coūsayll of his famous pope Caton / whyche in the boke of his counsayll or of wysedome thus sayth:

                           Quae cuspare soses, ea tu ne feceris ipse.
                           Turpe est doctori, cum cuspa redarguit ipsum.
                        
The whyche two verses maye be englyshed as foloweth,

                           Auyse ye well, let reason be thy guyde
                           when other folke thou arte aboute to blame / 
                           That suche defaute in the be not espyed.
                           For yf there be / then shalt thou haue the shame.
                           A mannes honoure suche thynges woll reclayme.
                           It ys full foule when that a man woll chese
                           If that hys dede agayne hys wordes preche.
                        
                     
                     This coūsayll was not remembred of the sayd Cardynall. For in the euenynge after he had lewdely blowen his horne, and sayde it was a detestable synne to aryse from the syde of a strumpet &amp; sacre the body of Cryste / he was taken wyth a strumpet to his open shame and rebuke.
                     In the .xxv. yere of kynge Henry

was called a counsayll at London / where the spyrytualty condescended that the kynges offycers shulde punyshe prestes that cheryshed the foresayde mulys. But the sayd offycers toke money, and sufferyd the prestes to spurre theyr mulys at theyr pleasure. whyche offyce at this daye is so clerely renoūced of al spyritual men / yt neyther kyng nor bishop taketh for yt any synes, nor yet correccyon necessarye to be done for the same.
                     In the .xxvii. yere of his reygne as reporteth an olde Cronycle / the gray freres by procuryng of ye kyng came fyrste into Englande, and had theyr fyrst house buylded at Caunterbury. And aboute this tyme by moste accorde of writers, dyed Henry the .iiii. emperour of that name / whyche as before is touched maryed Molde the doughter of kyng Henry. After whose deth the sayde empresse came vnto her father into Normandye. when kyng Henry was ascertaynted of the deth of Henry the emperour / for so myche as he hadde none heyre male, he caused soone after the more party of hys lordes of England as well spirytuall as temporall, to swere in his presence, that they shuld kepe ye land of Englande to the vse of Mawde ye empresse, yf he dyed wythoute yssue male, and she then suruyued
                     In the .xxviii. yere of kyng. Henry / Geffrey Plātagenet erle of Angeou maryed Molde the empresse. Of the whyche two descended Henry the second, that after Stephan was kyng of Englande. In this yere also the kynge had dyuers monycyons and vysyons. For amonge other ferefull dremys / he saw a great company of clerkys with dyuerse wepons, whyche manassed hym for dette that he shuld owe vnto them. And when they were passed / he thought yt he was manassed to deth of his own knyghtes. And lastely apperyd to hym a great company of byshoppes / whych thretened hym, and wolde haue smytten hym wyth theyr crosses. By this monicyon he toke remorce in his conscyence, and dyd great dedes of charyte in Normandye where he hadde sene these visyons. And after his cōmyng then into Englande / in satysfaccyon of wronges done to the chyrche as affermeth Guydo, he then founded the abbay of Redynge before spoken of. And ouer that he releasyd vnto Englyshe men the Dane gelt, that was by his father &amp; his brother renewed.
                     In the .xxx. yere of this kyng Henry, dyed the erle of Flaundres / and kynge Henry as sayth Ranulfe, was by agrement of Lewys the Frenche kyng made erle, as next heyr &amp; enherytour to the sayde erledome. But it is not there expressed by what maner of tytle or successyon.
                     In the .xxxii. yere of the kyng, dyed Robert Curthose the kynges broder the whyche he hadde kept as prysoner in the castell of Cardyfe from the iiii. yere of his reygn or there about / whose corps as before is shewed, was buryed at Glouceter before the hyghe alter. And aboute this tyme was founded the pryorye of Norton in the prouynce of Chester, by one wyllyam the sonne of Nychelle. And the abbay of Combremer in the same prouynce, was also founded aboute the same tyme.
                     In the .xxxv. yere of kynge Henry / was borne of Molde the empresse, Henry shorte mantell or Henry the seconde. The whyche as after shall be shewed was consentynge to the martyrdome of saynt Thomas of Caunterburye.
                     Kynge Henry beyng in Normandy after some writers, fell from or wyth hys horse / whereof he cought hys deth. But Ranulphe sayth he toke a

surfet by etynge of a lamprey &amp; ther of dyet, when he hadde reygned full xxxv. yeres and odde monethes. Then ye kynges bowellys were drawen out of hys body, and then salted wyth myche salte. And for to auoyde the stenche whych hadde infected many men / the body was lastely closed in a bulles skynne, and yet yt was not all stynted. He that clensed the hed, dyed of the stenche of the brayn. Then lastely the body was brought into England, &amp; buryed in the abbay of Redynge that he had before founded. Then ye fame of hym was blowen abrode as yt is blowen of other prynces / and sayde yt he passed other men in .iii. thynges. In wytte, in eloquence, and fortune of batayll. And other sayde he was ouercomen wyth iii. vyces / wyth couetyse, wyth cruelty, and wyth luste of lechery.
                     One other made these verys of hym as folowen.
                     
                        Kynge Henry is dede, bewte of the world, for whom great dole
                        Goddes now maken for theyr kynde brother. For he is sole,
                        Mercurius in speche, Marce in batayll, harte stronge Appollo,
                        Iupiter in hest, egall with Saturne and enymye to Cupido.
                        Kyng he was of right, &amp; man of most myght, and glorious in raynyng.
                        And when he left his crowne, thē fell honour downe, for mysse of suche a kynge.
                        Normandy than gan lowre, for losse of theyr floure, &amp; sange wel away.
                        Englande made mone, &amp; Scotlande dyd grone, for to se that daye.
                     
                  
                  
                     Francia. THE .CCXXX. CHAPITER.
                     LEwys the sonne of the fyrste Phylyp beganne hys reygne ouer the Frenchemen, in the yere of our lorde .xi. hundred &amp; .vii. to reken his begynnynge from the deth of his father / and the .vi. yere of the fyrste Henry then kyng of England. This Lewys as before is touched, was admytted to the rule of the land certayn yeres or hys father dyed, and was surnamed Lewes the great for grossenesse of his body.
                     Anon as this Lewys had fynyshed the obsequy of the funerallys of hys father / he wythoute taryenge called a counsayll of hys lordes spyrytuall and temporall at the cytye of Orleaunce / where of the byshoppe of the same see wyth other adioynynge, he was solemnly anoynted &amp; crowned. But not wythout grudge of the archbyshoppe of Raynes / for so mych as of custome the Frenche kynges vsed there to be crowned.
                     Soone after the coronacyon of Lewys / Guy le Rous, and Guy de Cressy his sonne, whych before tyme hadde ben at debate and warre with Lewys, and Lewys had from them taken ye castel of Gurnaye / this Guy le Rous wyth hys sonne seynge they might not preuayle agayn the kyng, awayted theyr tyme and season, and espyed when Endo hys owne broder and erle of Corbueyll went forth on huntynge, and toke hym, &amp; as a prysoner kept hym in the castell of Bawdum. whereof the cause was, for so myche as the sayde Endo wolde not assyste nor ayde ye sayd Guyle Rous his brother agayne the kynge. when thys was knowen, anon the frendes and tenauntes of the sayde erle shewyd this mater vnto the kynge / besechynge hym that he wolde ayde and assyste theym to recouer theyr naturall lorde. wherunto the kynge gran̄ted / and forth wyth sent a knyght or captayn of his named Auncelyne, accompanyed with .xl. horsmen before / for so myche as yt was shewyd vnto

the kyng, yt such as had ye rule of the castell wolde receyue suche persones as were sent from hym, and delyuer the castell wyth the prysoner vnto them. Uppon whyche appoyntemēt thys Ancelyne as before is sayd was sent to entre this castell. But all contrary to the former ꝓmise made / this Auncelyne was betrayed and taken, and many of his men slayne, &amp; hym selfe set in prison, where the sayd erle of Corbuayll was. wherof when the kynge was enfourmed / he was passynge greuously dyscontent. wherfore in all haste he sped him thyther, &amp; compassed ye castell wyth a stronge syege / and those that were wythin defended them manfully. In the tyme of the whyche syege nother Guy the fader, nor Guy hys sonne, were with in the sayde castell of Baudum.
                     But Guy ye son as a lusty and iuperdous knyght / put hym self in aduenture dyuers wayes and tymes to haue entred the sayde castell for comfort of his men / but all was in vayn. Fynally the kynge made so sore and cruell assautes, that he wan the fyrst warde wyth great dyffycultye, and after the hole / and delyueryd the erle and Auncelyn his stewarde, ye which were in great doute of theyr lyues. And such as he toke prysoners of the soldyours / some he put to deth, and some he prisoned to theyr lyues ende, to the terrour and fere of other.
                     In processe of tyme after at a place called the Roche of Guy, whych one Guy of olde tyme had buylded / dwel lyd at this daye one of that stocke named also Guy, the whyche hadde to wyfe a fayre and good woman, the doughter of one wyllyā a Norman. whyche wyllyam entendynge to dysheryte the sayde Guy, and to be lord of that stronge place / vppon a tyme when the sayde Guy was in ye chyrch or chapell to here his dyuyne seruyce entred the chyrche wyth a certayn of harnessed knightes vnder theyr man tellys, and fell vppon hym and all to hewe hym. wherof herynge the wyfe / ranne as a madde woman, and fell vppon her husbande, to the entēt to saue hym from the strokes. But the tyrauntes were so cruell, yt they forbare nothynge of theyr cruel tye / but wounded her wyth her husbande, so that both were slayne / and that done entred the castell, and slew all suche as they found therin. when this willyam fader to ye wife of Guy, or broder to her as affermeth maister Robert Gagwyne, was possessed of ye castell of Guyon / he thought therby to rule all the countrey enuyron. But the gentylles and commons he rynge of thys shamefull murder / assembled thē to gither / &amp; of one mynde whyle some of them yode to the kyng to enfurme hym of that cruell dede, the other prepared abyllementes of warre, and layde syege to the sayde castell. The kynge Lewys herynge of this shamfull dede, and the wynnynge of so stronge an holde, ferynge the rescue of Englishmen and Normans, leste that castell by that meane myghte fall in theyr handes / sent his commyssyon vnto the rulers of that countrey, chargynge theym wyth all dylygence to assaute that place. And yf they myght wynne yt / to put the executours of that murder vnto moste shamefull deth. whyche commaundement receyued from the kynge / stronge assaute &amp; cruell was made, &amp; manfully yt was defended. But the losse ran to theym of the castell / so that in processe of tyme when this willyam conceyued well that he myght not contynue the defence therof, he began to treate &amp; agreed, that yf he myghte haue free yssue for hym and hys, &amp; assuraunce that he wyth his knyghtes myght go quyetly vnto

a place that he wold chose / he wold then delyuer the castell wyth all that was therin. The whyche requeste of dyuerse of the hedde captaynes was graunted and sworne. But so soone as the castell was delyuered, and the Frenchemen entred / the multytude not wythstandynge the former promyse and othe, fell vppon the sayde wyllyam and his soudyours, &amp; them put vnto deth by many cruell tormē
                        tes / &amp; fynally caste all theyr careyns into the ryuer of Sayne, vppon the brynke wherof the sayde roche and castell was standynge.
                     And shortely after this, ensued the warre betwene this Lewys &amp; kynge Henry of Englande, as yt is before shewyd in ye .x. yere of ye sayde Henry. And after the warre ended betwene these two prynces / Hugh Puyssake a man of great myght at those dayes in Fraunce, rebelled agayne ye kyng / and warred greuously vppon or agayn the countesse of Chartres / and robbed and pylled the chyrches of ye countrey, as well as other places / so that the sayd coūtesse with her yonge sonne Thybaude, were fayne to seke socoure of the kynge. wherfore the kynge called a counsayll at hys citye of Meleyne / where agayne the sayd Hugh many greuous complayntes were put. But for so myche as ye sayd Hugh at that tyme was not present, to make answere vnto such thynges as then was layde to his charge / the kynge commaunded that the castell of Terry or of Thoree in all haste shulde be manned &amp; vytayled, to the ende that by the comforte &amp; strength of that castell, the kynge yf nede requyred myght lay syege to the castell of Puyssake, for so mych as that one was nere adioynynge vnto ye other. In whych passe tyme the sayd Hugh was somoned to appere before the kynge and his counsayll / but he refused to appere.
                     when the kynge was enfourmed of the garnyshyng of ye castell of Thorre, and of the disobedyence of Hugh / he assembled a stronge hoste, and cō
                        passed the castell of Puyssake with a syege / and set Thybaude son of the countesse vppon that syde that stode towarde the prouynce of Chartres, so that stronge assautes and cruell warre was made on euery parte. what shulde I make longe processe / to tell of the ferefull shot of the gonnys vppon bothe partyes, or of the sharpe shot of Arowes, the castynge of stonys, or scalynge of the wallys, or fyllynge of the dyches, the fyryng of the gates, or yet the mortall and cruell fyght on bothe partes / nor of ye manyfold dede bodyes &amp; maymed, by reason of ye sayd assautes / or yet ye manasses or mockes, or great bosus or crakes vsed of the souldyours durynge this syege. But fynally after the kynge hadde lyen before the sayd castell a certayne of tyme, he wanne yt by pure force, and toke the sayde Hughe wyth hys accessaryes. The whyche he commaunded to be kepte as prysoners in the castell of Thorre for a season. Then the kynge caste downe the sayde castell of Puyssake to the grounde, excepte a lytle towre made of tymber, the whyche he reseruyd for a lodgynge. And that done some of the forsayd prysoners he put to deth, and some he dysherityd after the grefe of theyr offence. And so this foresayd countesse of Charters with her sonne Thybaude was in quyete of theyr countrey and castell of Puyssake belongynge to the sayde erledome. But howe yt was / in processe of tyme folowynge thys Thybaude entended to haue reedyfyed there a newe castell / wherby as the kinge was enformed, he wold haue encroched thynges appertaynynge

to the crowne of Fraunce / wherfore the kynge wythstode yt. For this / a grudge fell betwene the kynge and erle Thybaude / so that in processe dedely warre was made betwen thē. The whyche contynued in such wise to theyr both damages / that fynally the warre was agayne reuyued betwene kynge Lewys and kynge Henry, as in the .xvii. yere of the reygne of the sayde Henry is declared, by meane of thys warre betwene the kynge and this erle Thybaude. wherof the cyrcumstaunce wold axe a longe leysure to reherse, as yt is shewyd in the frenche storye. But fynally this erle Thybaude loste none honour / all be yt that the frenche cronycle wonderfully fauoreth ye party of the Frenche kynge, that the reader maye well apperceyue, Quis pin xit leonem.

                     THis Lewys also hadde great warre wyth Henry the fourth of that name emperour / the whyche maryed Molde the doughter of Henry the fyrste kynge of England, as before is shewed. whefore the occasyon was as sayth the Frenche cronycle / for so myche as the sayd Henry the emperour hadde before tyme ben accursed of Gelasius the seconde of that name then pope, at Raynes a citye in Fraunce. For the whych cause as there is surmytted / the sayde emperoure assembled an huge hoste of Almaynes and Italyens, and entred the lande of Fraunce, and dyd therin myche harme. But in the ende when he knew of the great prouisyon ye Lewis made to mete him, &amp; of his great power / he then as affermeth ye frēch cronycle, wythdrewe hym / and so auoyded the lande of Fraūce wythout stroke strykyng. But of this speketh nothyng the authour that wrote the story of this Henry the emperour.
                     After this the erle of Flaundres named Charlys, the systers sonne of kynge Lewys nexte duke after Baldewyn, whych dyed as before is sayd in the thyrde chapyter of the story of kyng Henry, of a woūde in his face / this foresayd Charlys was sore hated of the prouoste of Brudgys. The whyche to bryng his malyce to some effecte / counsayled wyth hys adherentes how he myght slee the sayde Charlys. By whose coūsayle a meane was founde to brynge the erle to Brudgys a towne of Flaundres, for the wele of the sayde towne. After whose commynge vppon a daye he beynge in a chyrche and herynge his dyuyne seruyce, was slayne of ye sayd prouoste and his complycys. wherof herynge kynge Lewys / anon wyth a great army entred Flaundres, and besyeged the town of Brudges, and lastely toke the sayde prouoste. The whyche fyrst was bounden to a post, &amp; then his eyen wyth a reede stryken out of hys hed / And then shot wyth arowes / &amp; lastely set vppon a whele, where he remayned tyl he dyed. And a felowe of hys named Bartopus, ye whyche was consentyng to the same murder / was hanged vppon a galos by the waste and armys / and by hym amastyfe or great curre dogge, the whyche as soon euer he was smytten bote vppon the sayde Bartopus / so that in processe he all to rent hym, &amp; dyd to hym so great payne, that lastely he endyd his lyfe in great mysery.
                     In the time of ye reygn of this Lewys / the bishop of Clermōde was voyded his see by the cruelnes of the erle of Auerne, wherfore the kyng assembled his knyghtes / and by strength, set the byshoppe in hys place agayne maugry his enymyes. And agayne the second tyme when he was eft put

out by the sayde erle / the kynge restoryd hym / and toke suche pledges of the erle, that he remayned after in good quyet. In ye later dayes of this Lewys / his eldest sonne named Phylyppe wyth a conuenyent company, vppon a daye for his dysporte rode about certayne stretys of the cytye of Parys / and as he rode, an hogge sodeynly starte amonge the horse fete of the chylde / wherwyth the horse beynge frayde lepte sodeynly, and cast the chylde to the grounde, wyth so great vyolence that he dyed ye nyght folowynge. For this myssehappe the kynge toke great heuynesse / so that he waxed dayly more feble. And for he was vnweldly by reason of ouer ladynge of fleshe, and myghte not well trauayll / he therfore by the aduyce of hys lordes, admytted hys seconde sonne named Lewys to the rule of the realme, and hym he crowned by his lyfe tyme / and also maryed hym vnto Elynoure the doughter of the duke of Guyan, by whych he was inherytoure vnto her father. And shortely after the kynge sykened / and to hys great payne in an horse lytter was brought vnto saynt Denys. where he lyenge a season syke, and knew that the owre of deth was nere / commaunded suche as were aboute hym that they shulde spredde a tapytte vppon the ground, and then laye hym vppon the sayde tappette, and vppon hym to be made a crosse of asshes / whyche all was done accordynge to his commaundement. And there he so laye tyll he dyed, in the yere of hys reygne to reken from the deth of his father to his owne endynge daye .xxx. yeres / so that he reygned .xxix yeres full and odde monethes / and was buryed in the monastery of saynte Denys with great pompe, wyth thys scrypture folowynge vppon his tombe.

                        STephan erle of Boloyn, and son of the erle of Blesence, and of the wyues syster of Henry the fyrst named Mary / beganne his reygne ouer the realme of Englande, in the yere of our lord .xi.C.xxxvi / &amp; the first yere of Lewes ye .viii. of yt name then kyng of Fraunce. This was a noble man and hardy. But contrarye hys othe, after the affyrmaunce of some wryters that he made to Molde the empresse / he toke vpon hym ye crowne / and was crowned vppon saynte Stephans daye in the Crystemasse

weke at westmynster, of the archbisshoppe of Caunterbury, the whyche in lykewyse had made lyke othe vnto the sayde empresse, in presence of her fader as before is touched. In punyshment wherof as men denied / the sayde archbyshoppe dyed shortly after. And many other lordes whyche dyd accordyng lyke / went not quyte wythout punyshement. A great causer of this periurye as rehersyth one authour, was this / one Hugh Bygot stewarde somtyme wyth Henry the fyrste / immedyatly after the deceace of the sayde Henry, came vnto England / and before the sayde archbysshop and other lordes of the lande, toke wyllfully an othe / &amp; sware that he was present a lytle before the kynges deth, when kynge Henry admytted &amp; chase for hys heyre to be kynge after hym Stephan hys neuewe / for so myche as Molde his doughter had dyscontented hym. wher vnto the archbyshoppe wyth the other lordes gaue to hasty credence. But this Hugh scaped not vnpunyshed / for he dyed myserably in a shorte tyme after.
                     when kyng Stephan was crowned he sware before the lordes at Oxynforde, that he wolde not holde in hys hand the benefyces that voyded / and that he wold forgyue the Dane gelt as kyng Henry before hym had done wyth other thynges whyche I passe ouer. And for this Stephan drad the cōmynge of the empresse / he therfore gaue lycence vnto his lordes, yt euery of them myght buylde a castell or strong fortres vpon his own groūd. And soone after he agreed wyth Dauyd kynge of Scottes, &amp; receyued of hym homage, after he had from hym wonne some townes and holdes.
                     The towne of Exetoure rebellyd agayne the kynge in the seconde yere of hys reygne. But he in the ende he subdued theym. And wyllyam archbyshoppe of Caunterburye dyed the same yere / whose benefyce was after gyuen to Thibaude abbot of Becco in Normandye.
                     About the fourth yere of his reygne / Dauyd kynge of Scottys repentynge hym of hys former agrement made wyth the kynge, entred of newe the boundes of Northumberlande aboute the ryuer of Theyse towarde the prouynce of yorke, and brent and slewe the people in moste cruell wyse / not sparynge man, woman, nor chylde. Agayne whome Thurstone by the kynges cōmaundement was sent. The whych wyth his power quytte hym so knyghtly, that he ouer threwe the hoste of Scottes, and slewe of theym a great nomber, and compellyd theym to wythdrawe agayne into Scotlande. In the which passetyme ye kyng layde syege to the castell of Bedforde and wanne yt. And that done / he then made a vyage into Scotlande, where he dyd lytle to hys pleasure or profyte. Then in his retourne homewarde he toke Alexaunder byshoppe of Lyncolne / and helde hym in duresse tyll he hadde yelded or gyuen vnto hym the castell of Newerke. And then he chased Nygellus byshop of Ely.
                     Also in thys furye he toke suche displeasure with his louynge frende Roger byshop of Salysburye / that he caste hym in bondes tyll the sayde Roger hadde rendred vnto hym the two castellys of Uyes and Shyrburne. For the whyche thys Roger in remembrynge the great ingratytude of the kynge / toke such thought that he dyed shortely after / and left in redy coyne .xl. thousande marke, whyche after hys deth came to the kynges cofers.
                     One cronycle sayth that kynge Stephan obteyned these foresayde castellys,

to the entent he myght fortyfye theym wyth his knyghtes to wythstande the empresse, whose cūmynge he euer fered. And ye yere folowynge he wāne wyth strength the castellys of Glowceter, of Herford, of webley, of Brystowe, of Dudley, &amp; of Shrewesburye / for the whyche cause Robert erle of Glouceter began to wythdrawe hys allegeaunce from kynge Stephan. This Robert was the son of Henry the fyrst by reason of baste / and for thys dyspleasure sent letters vnto Molde the empresse hys syster, promysynge to her great ayde to wynne her ryght.
                     In the meane whyle that the empresse made prouysyon for her iourney / kynge Stephan concluded a maryage betwene Eustace his sonne and Constaunce the kynges syster of Fraunce, doughter of Lewys the great / the whyche contynued the amyte betwene England and Fraūce.
                     Then in the moneth of Iuly and vi. yere of Stephan / Molde the empresse as testyfyeth Henry the chanon in hys .ix. boke, entred this land by the porte of Portesmouthe / and so kepte on her iourney tyll she came to Brystowe, and dyd great harme by the meane of her passage through the countrey. In whyche tyme of her sayde landynge, kyng Stephan laye at the syege of walyngforde castell. But as soone as he harde of the landynge of the empresse / he anon sente oute commyssyons for more strength, and so drewe towarde hys enymyes. But in this tyme and season Robert erle of Glowceter, and Ranulfe erle of Chester, wente vnto the empresse wyth all the power that they might make. The empresse herynge the great power commynge wyth the kynge / drewe to the cytye of Nycoll now called Lyncolne, and there helde her a longe season for all that the kyng myght do. But lastely the empresse wyth her people escaped / and the kynge was possessyd of the cytye, and there bode tyll Candelmas. After whyche season / erle Robert and Ranulfe before named, with a great power of walshmen, &amp; ye power of the empresse, came agayn the kynge. where as when bothe hostes were nere ioynyng / the erle Ranulfe of Chester spake to his knightes and sayd: I requyre you that I that am cause of your parell, may be the fyrst that shall entre into the parell. Then answered erle Robert and sayd / yt is not vnworthy to the yt axeste the fyrst stroke and dignyte of this fyght. For to the yt is syttynge, for noblesse of blood and vertue of strength, in the whyche thou passest other men. But the kinges false othe moueth men to warre and to fyght / where we muste now wynne the mastry or be ouercomē. And he yt hath none other socour, is cōstrayned to defende hym by knyghtly and stronge dedes of armes &amp; of manhode. And so shall we now agayne theym that by entryked wyth gyle &amp; wyckednesse / as Robert erle of Mellent, the erle also of Albemarll, and Symon of Hampton, the which is a man of great boste and of small myght.
                     Then kyng Stephan prepayred to set forwarde hys people / and erle Baudewyne had wordes of comfort to the kynges peple,Thre thynges requysyte to fyght &amp; sayde: Men yt shall fyghte / to theym is behouefull thre thynges. The fyrst is ryght of ye cause, leste men fal in parell of soule. The second is quantyte of men of armys, leste men be oppreste wyth excedynge nomber. And the thyrde is the effecte corage of strēgth of knightes, yt the quarel shuld not fayle for lacke of hardy and assured fyghtynge. As touchynge whyche thre poyntes I truste we be well sped. But &amp; ye take

hede farthermore what enymyes we haue / fyrste we haue agayne vs Robert erle of Glouceter, whyche vseth great manasses, and executeth lytle or small dedys. In mouth he is a lyon / but in harte he is a shepe. He is pompous in speche, and darke in vnderstandyng. There is also Ranulfe erle of Chester / a man wythout reason and full of folehardynesse / redy and preste to all conspyracy and vnstedfastnesse of maner and dedes, hasty and furyouse of hart, and vnware of parellys. He assayeth oft to acheue great dedes / but he bryngeth none to effecte. And what he fyrsly and fresshely begynneth / he cowardely and fayntly forsaketh, as vnhappy and vngracyous in all his dedys / and is ouercomen in euery place. For he holdeth wyth hym banyshed men &amp; scullers. And the mo of them that be in a company, the soner they be ouercomē / and weke they be in fyghtyng, for eyther of theym putteth truste in his felowe whyle hym selfe is ouerthrowen.
                     But or he myght haue finyshed his wordes to moste mennys audyence / the crye of the enymyes, wyth noyse of trumpettes and gruntyng of horsys approched and smote to gyther / and forth go the arowes, and gresely &amp; cruell fyghte was contynued vppon bothe sydes for the whyle yt yt enduryd. where through the grene feld was turned into a perfyte redde / so that many a pale &amp; wan vysage was there sene yeldynge the gooste, wyth armys and legges disseueryd and departed. A longe whyle thys fyghte stode in questyon, whyther partye shulde obteyne vyctorye. But in the ende kynge Stephans partye gaue backe and fledde / and he full knyghtly abode on felde wyth a fewe of his knyghtes, and was taken, and so was brought vnto the empresse / the whyche commaunded hym to be conueyed vnder sure kepyng vnto Brystowe, where he was kepte as a prysoner from the sayde tyme of Candelmasse vnto holy Roode daye next ensuynge.
                     Aboute this tyme was founded the Abbay of Stratforth Langthorne wythin .iiii. myles of London, by a knyght called syr wyllyam de Moūtfychet.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXXIII. CHAPITER.
                     WHen the empresse hadde wonne this vyctorye, and had commytted the kyng to warde, as before ye haue harde / she was not therwith a lytle exalted / but thoughte in her mynde that she was in a suerty of the possessyon of the hole realme. But she was disceyued / for Kent toke partye wyth kynge Stephan. But yet after this victory thus obteyned, the empresse came vnto wynchester, and after to wyltone, to Oxenforde, to Redynge, and to saynte Albonys / into the whyche cytyes and townes she was receyued wyth all honoure. And fynally she came to London, for to entre the state of the lande. At her whyche there beynge / the quene made assyduat laboure for the delyuerye of the kynge her husbande / promysynge that he shulde surrender the lande into her possessyon, and he to be come a religyous man, other ellys a pylgryme to hys lyues ende. But all was in vayne / for she myght purchace no grace as then vppon no maner of condycyons. The cytezens of London also made great laboure, that they myghte vse the lawys of Edwarde the confessoure, as they were graunted by wyllyam Conqueroure / and not the lawys of her father, whyche were of more straytnesse. wherof in no wyse

they of her coūsayll myght haue any graunte. For this the cytezens were dyscontentyd / and knowynge that the countrey of Kent wolde strength theyr partye, ordeyned to haue taken her. But she beynge therof warned / departed in haste, and lefte behynde her hyr store of housholde, and so fledde vnto Oxynforde / where she abode her people, the whyche was deuyded and scateryd. And in thys whyle she sente vnto Dauyd kynge of Scottes and her vncle for to ayde her, the whyche in all haste came vnto her / and so yode to wynchester, where she layde syege to the byshoppes towre, the whyche the kynges brother at that tyme helde wyth strength.
                     Then the quene wyth ayde of her frendes, of Kentyshemen and other / made a stronge hoste / wherof was capytayne a knyght named Guyllyam de Pre. whē the empresse harde of ye great strength of the quene, and saw that her owne mynyshed rather then encreasyd / she fled secretely and escaped vnto Glouceter. And erle Robert her brother was taken soone after, and put in pryson. Then Dauyd kynge of Scottes herynge of thys / returned into Scotland. Then meanes was made vpon eyther syde, for deliuery and exchaunge of the prysoners / so that fynally yt was agreed that the kynge shulde be delyueryd for erle Robert. But or thys agrement were concluded myche sorowe was wroughte wythin thys realme. For the empresse pylled and spoyled on hyr partye / and the quene by promyses and manaces borowed &amp; toke vppō ye other syde / &amp; the soudyours stale and extorcyoned vpō both partyes / so that riche men were made nedy, and the poore were oppressed.
                     In thys meane whyle the empresse retourned agayne to Oxynforde &amp; vytayled and manned yt in her beste maner.
                     Then lastely the kyng was delyuered vpon holy Roode day in haruest, and soon after he becleped Oxynford wyth a stronge syege, from the tyme of Mychelmasse vnto the season of Crystemas / at whyche tyme and season the empresse vsed a new gyle for constraynte and necessyte of vytayle.
                     In that tyme was great plente of snow fallen vppon the grounde / and the frost was therwyth so great, that Thamys wyth other great ryuers were then frosen ouer / so that man &amp; horse myghte passe ye water vppō the yse. The empresse then constrayned of nede as before is sayd, apparayled her and her companye in whyte clothynge, whych a farre of apered lyke the snow / and so vpon a plumpe goyng to gyther as nere as they myght escaped the daunger of theyr fone / &amp; so came to walyngforde. And thens in processe of tyme she wyth a small companye departed, and retourned fynally into Normandye vnto her husbande.
                     So soon as the empresse was thus departed from Oxenforde, the town was yelden vnto ye kynge / where the kyng had mich of the empresse stu
                           ••
                        e as wel harnes as other stuffe of housholde. Thē he entendyd to haue pursued her. But tydyngꝰ were brought vnto hym, yt Ranulfe erle of Chester wyth an hoste of walshmen was commyng towarde hym. But by medyacyon of frendes thys Ranulfe in the ende to the kynge was reconcyled, and was wyth hym agreed.
                     About this tyme and season as yt is testyfyed of dyuerse authours / the Iewes vpon Ester euyn crucyfyed a chylde named wyllyam, in the cytye of Norwyche. And in the tyme of Henry the second, about ye .vi. yere of his reygn as sayth Policronicon,

they crucified an other at Glouceter.
                     In the .xxii. yere of his reygn / kyng Stephan was agayne crowned at Lyncolne. And soon after he toke frō Ranulphe erle of Chester the castell of Lyncolne.
                     Robert erle of Glouceter made also newe warre vppon the kynge / &amp; had the better of the kynge at wyltone, so that the kynge was lyke to haue fallen in Robertys daūger. But yet the kynge escaped wyth myche payne. And there was taken a baron of the kynges named syr willyam Martel, for whose delyuery the kynge gaue after to the sayde erle the castell of Shyrbourne. And that done yt sayd erle Robert began to foūde a stronge castell at Faryngdone. wherof the kynge beynge enfourmed, assembled his knyghtes and sped hym thytherwarde / by meane wherof the worke was for that tyme empeached &amp; let.
                     In the .xv. yere of the reygne of kynge Stephan / the ryuer of Thamys was so strongely ouerfrosen, that horse and carte passed ouer vppon the yse.
                     In the .xvi. yere / Ranulphe erle of Chester dyed, that was surnamed Gercyous, and was the .iiii. erle after the conqueste / and his sonne Hughe was erle after hym, which was a mā of great strength and vertue. And in the same yere, as wytnessyth Guydo and other / dyed Geffrey Plantagenet husband of Molde the empresse. After whose deth, Henry short mantell that was the son of the sayde Geffrey and Molde / was made duke of Angeous &amp; Normandye. The which in few yeres after maryed Elyanour the doughter of the erle of Poytow / the whych Elyanour was before maryed vnto Lewys kynge of Fraūce, and from hym deuorced for nerenes of blood, when he hadde receyued of her .ii. doughters named Mary and Alys, as wytnessyth the frenche cronycle. And so this Henry was erle of Angeous by his fader, duke of Normandy by his mother, &amp; erle of Poytowse by his wyfe.
                     It was not longe after, that Eustace the sonne of kynge Stephan wyth ayde of the Frenche kyng, warred vppon Henry duke of Normandye / the whyche after some wryters was ymagyned by Stephan his father, to the entent to let or stop hym yt he shuld not come into England to clayme his enherytaunce. But duke Henry defended hym so knyghtly, yt the sayde Eustace wanne therby lytle honour or profyte.
                     An old cronycle sheweth, that kyng Stephan entended to haue crowned the sayde Eustace his sonne kyng of Englande by his dayes / but the bysshoppes of Englande refused ye dede by cōmaundement of the pope.
                     In the .xxvii. yere / the kynge layd syege vnto the castelles of Newebery, of walyngforde, and of warwyke or warwell / the whyche hadde ben kepte by the empresse frendes from the tyme of her departyng vnto that daye, and hoped of rescous by Henry duke of Normandy. But ye kynge then wan the castellys of Newebery and of warwell / and walyngforde defended the holders tyl the cōmyng of Henry the duke. The whyche in the ende of ye sayde yere wyth a great armye entred Englande / and fyrste wanne the castell of Malmysburye. And thens he yode to London / and wanne the towre, as myche by Polycy and by fayre ꝓmyse as by strēgth. And suche stuffe of vytayle and armoure as he fande therin / he sent to walyngforde. And that done he wēt to the towne of walyngforde / &amp; wan such holdes as were there about.
                     Then kyng Stepan wyth his power drewe towarde the duke / and fynally

by meane of medyatours, as Thybaude archbyshoppe of Caūterbury and other / both prynces to comon of peace, met nere vnto ye water of Uryn or Urn. But as fast as some laboured to haue peace, so fast other laboured to haue warre / so that at that communacacyon the peace was not concluded.
                     After the kynge and the duke were departed / the kynge yode towarde Epyswyche in Suff. And the duke toke the way to Srewesbury / where he wan the castell of the sayde town. From thens the duke wente to Nothyngham and wan the towne. wherfore the soldyours that helde the castell, seynge that the towne toke ꝑtye wyth the duke / brake out vppon the nyght, and fyred the town and brent a great parte therof.
                     In this while dyed and was drowned Eustace the sonne of kynge Stephan / and was buried at Feuersham in Kent in the abbay that his father before had buylded.
                     Thybaude archbyshop of Caunterbury left not to labour &amp; conclude ye peace betwene ye kyng &amp; the duke / &amp; endeuored hym selfe therin so dylygently, wyth the assystence of other, that in the yere folowynge the peace was cōcluded vppon dyurese condycyons. wherof one was, that ye kyng shulde contynue as kynge durynge his lyfe / and immedyatly after ye conclusion of this peace, the sayd Henry shuld be proclaymed in all the chefe cytyes and townes of Englande for heyr apparant, &amp; be kynge after the deth of the sayde Stephan / and that the kynge shulde take hym for hys son of adopcyon and ryghtefull heyr vnto the crowne. To the whyche couenaūtes iustly to be holden / ye kyng was fyrste sworne, and after his lordes spyrytuall and temporall / and so yode bothe to London, where they were royally receyued. And when ye kyng had fested the duke, and gyuen to hym ryche gyftes / he toke leue of the kynge, and so returned into Normandye, as affyrmeth the sayde authour the Floure of historyes. Howe be yt the cronycle of England sayth, that the accorde was made vpon dyuysyon of the lande betwene theym / that is to meane that both shuld reygne to gyther, and eyther of them to enioye halfe the lande. But how that dyuysyon was made, or whych parte of the lande eueryche of them shulde hold / no mēcion therof is made. And the former accorde shuld be as abue is sayde, concluded .viii. days folowynge the Epyphanye of our lorde in the towne of Oxenford. And ye kyng dyed in the moneth of October folowyng, when he had reygned .xviii. yeres full and odde monethes / and was enterred in theforsayde abbay of Feuyrsham.
                     Of dyuers authours as Ranulfe and other / yt is recorded that thys Stephan lyued in great vexacyon and trouble all the terme of hys reygne. It is sayde also that thys Stephan maryed Molde or Mawde the doughter of Mary / the whyche was the doughter of Henry the fyrst, and countesse of Boloyne / by whome he claymed the tytle to be crowned, as by the yonger doughter of Henry the fyrst / and Henry shorte mantell claymed by the elder. But after most certenty of wryters / this Stephan was sonne of Eustace erle of Boloyne, and of Mary syster vnto Molde that was maryed vnto Henry the fyrste / whych Molde and Mary were doughters of Margarete wife of Malcolyn kyng of Scottes / whyche Margaret was syster to Edgare Ethelynge, and doughter of Edwarde the outlawe, that was the sonne of Edmunde Ironsyde. Then

the eldest syster Molde, bare Molde the empresse by Henry the fyrste. And Molde ye empresse doughter of Henry the fyrst / hadde by her second husbande Geffrey Plantagenet Henry the seconde. And so by Henry shorte mantell or Henry the seconde, returneth the bloode of the Saxons to the crowne of Englande, and so it dyd by Stephan / but moste conuenyently by Henry the fyrst, as by the dyssent of his mother. By whych reason yt foloweth, that the blood of willyam conquerour continued but .lxx. yeres / yf it be accompted from ye fyrst yere of wyllyam Conquerour, vnto the laste yere of Henry the fyrste.
                     Thys kynge Stephan at the request of Molde hys wyfe / buylded in the yere of grace .xi. hundred .xl, ye abbey of Coggeshale in Essex, and set therin whyte mūkes. Also about the same tyme he founded the abbay of Feuersham in Kent / where he nowe corporally resteth. And the thyrde he founded in Furneys in Lancashyre / and all he garnyshed wyth munkys of Cysteaux order / &amp; dyed as before is sayde wythout yssue of his body.
                  
                  
                     Francia. THE .CCXXXIIII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        LEwys the .viii. of that name, &amp; son of Lewys ye great began his reygn ouer the Frenche men, in ye yere of our lord .xi. hundred &amp; .xxxvi / &amp; ye fyrst yere of Stephan then kyng of Englande. This also is called the yonger Lewys / in whose begynnynge Iohannes de tēporibus dyed. Thys Iohn̄ was somtyme a squyer in the house of Charlys the conquerour / the whyche lyued ouer .iii. hundred yeres, for whyche cause he was named Iohn̄ of tyme, as he yt myght remēber thinges done of longe tyme passed. This Lewys at ye tyme of his fathers deth, was in the countrey of Guyan, for to receyue the dower of his wyfe Elyanour, as before in the storye and seconde chapyter of kyng Stephan is touched. But when he harde of ye deth of his father / he sped hym into Fraūce. where after the necessaryes for the weale of his realme ordeyned / he maryed his wyues syster named Alys, vnto Arnolde erle of Uermendoze. After whyche maryage solempnysed / tydynges were broughte vnto hym, that the crysten people beynge in the holy lande as warryours vppon the Turkes and Sarasyns, were dystressed and ouerthrowen / and dyuerse stronge holdes from them taken and wonne. wherfore by the exhortacyon of that holy mūke Bernarde, whych at this day is called saynt Bernard / ye sayd Lewys, wyth also Conradus the .iii. of that name then emperour of Almayne, wyth Alphon then kynge of Spayne, wyth dyuerse other nobles of Fraunce &amp; other prouynces / toke vpon them the crosse, and prouyded for the expedycyon of that iourney, in the .iiii. yere of hys reygne after some wryters. But of the takyng of hys iourney dyuers writers holde diuers oppinyons / so that the doute resteth betwene the yere of our lord .xi. hundred &amp; .xl, and the yere of .xi. hundred and .l.
                     when all thynges were redy for that iourney / the kynge, the quene, wyth the floure of the chyualry of Fraūce set forthwarde vppon that iourney / and came in processe of tyme vnto Constantyn the noble / where he met wyth Conradus the emperour, and Alphons kynge of Spayne. whom the prynce Emanuell then emperour

of Constantyne the noble receyued ioyusly / and made to theym by his outwarde contenaunce louynge and frendely chere / and promised vnto theym ayde in that iourney bothe of vitayll and also for guydes for the nexte and surest waye. But he contrary to his promyse dyd dysapoynte theym, and nothynge ayded theym. For he delyueryd vnto theym meale myngeled wyth lyme, wherof grewe myche harme to the crysten hoste after. And also he assygned vnto them suche guydes, as brought them into places and coūtreys of sterylyte and other daunger / so that hastely the Frenche kyng wyth great dyffyculte and losse of his men, came vnto the citye of Danas, and becleped yt with a stronge syege / the whych he assauted and enpayred very sore, and was lykely to haue wonne yt, yf he had assauted ye place styll where he began. But by counsayll of some false crysten men, the whyche as wytnesseth Peter Dysroye and other had taken mede of the Turkes / the kynge by theyr counsayll remoued the ordynaunce from the weker place vnto ye strōger. where after dyuers assautes made / the kyng conceyued well yt he was dysceyued. A cause of this treason as sayth ye foresayde Peter was this. The erle of Flaūdres, which by dyuerse experymētes saw that the cytye was lyke to be goten / made supplycacyon to the kynge and the lordes, that he myghte haue the rule of the cytye at suche tyme as yt were wonne / the which to hym was graū
                        ted. wherof beynge aduertysed dyuerse Suryons of ye coūtrey borne, dysdayned that a straunger shuld be lorde of theyr enherytaunce / and for that condescēded and agreed to that treason, by mean wherof the crysten prynces loste theyr trauell.
                     Then the crysten prynces seynge yt they were thus deluded / toke theyr aduyce howe they myght contynewe theyr pylgrimage vnto the holy citye of Hierusalem. But in this counsayl sourded and quykened so many opynyons / that eche was contraryous vnto other. By mean wherof the emperour was so dyscontented / that he toke leue of the Frenche kynge and other, and so returned into hys own countrey. But the Frenche kynge taryed there in that costes a yere after / and dyd there but lytle worthye any memory. All be yt of this vyage the frenche boke maketh a great &amp; longe processe, touchynge the wynnyng of the cytye of Anteoche / wyth hys beynge and counsayllys kepynge wythin Hierusalem, &amp; other thinges there rehersed. But for I se the mater dysagreable to other wryters, and also thynke that myche therof is fayned / I therfore passe yt ouer, howe be yt that to some persones suche fablys ben full pleasaunte to here. wherfore all suche I remytte vnto the sayde french cronicle / &amp; somwhat I shall folowe the authour Gyraldꝰ, yt which wyth other testyfyen, that Lewys in his returne towarde Fraunce waxed syke for ye long forberyng of his wife. wherfore by thaduyce of phisycyons &amp; also of byshops / he was coūsayled to take a wenche because his wyfe was so farre from hym. But ye kyng wythstode that counseyll / and sayde that hym hadde bene leuer to be syke and dye of goddes hande / then to lyue in spouse brekynge,A kynges chas

                           e, &amp; offende hys lawes. And so the kyng put himselfe to the mercy of god and receyued helth shortly after. Also it is told of hym that he vsed to faste euery frydaye brede and water / and by his famylyers he was counsayled that he shulde leue that faste for wekynge of hym selfe / &amp; fede a hundred of poore men euery frydaye, the whyche vnto

god shuld be myche more acceptable. To this he answered and sayde, we wold gladly fede so many poore men or mo / but our fastynge woll we not breke. For wythout the profyte that yt doth vnto the soule, yt profyteth also right myche to the body. For the purgacyon and reste of one daye, helpeth myche to put of the superfluyte of the other / and also yt maketh the sharper apetyte.
                     when Lewys was retourned into Fraunce / for what happe yt is of the frenche cronycle made doutefull, he was from Elyanour hys wyfe deuorced, of the whych he hadde receyued before .ii. doughters as before is touched / the whyche in processe of tyme folowynge, was maried vnto Henry duke of Normandy. whych maryage was a new occasyon of the warre betwene Englande and Fraunce. For the landes of Poytowe, wyth Gascoyne and Guyan, Lewys claymed by his former possessyon, &amp; Henry by reason of the maryag of ye sayd Elyanour, as heyr to the sayde landes. Of the whyche warre shalbe shewed in the story of ye sayde Henry folowyng. After whyche deuorce thus made / kynge Lewys maryed the yongeste doughter of the kynge of Spayne that was named Cūstaunce / and she dyed of her fyrst chylde. Then for so myche as kynge Lewys hadde none heyr male / by coūsayll of his barony he maryed the thyrd wyfe, the whych was the yongeste doughter of Thybaude erle of Bloys, &amp; was named Alys. This sayde erle dyed / and left after hym .iiii. sonnes and .v. doughters. The eldest sonne named Henry was erle of Troys / the seconde named Thybaude was erle of Bloys / the thyrd named Stephan was erle of Sancorum or Sauncorer / and ye fourth named wyllyam was archbysshoppe of Raynes. The eldeste of the doughters was duches of Burgoyne / the seconde was countesse of Barre / the thyrde was maryed fyrst to the duke of Puell, and after to a knyght named syr william de Goer, the fourth was countesse of Perche / and the fyfte as before is sayd quene of Fraūce, whych was a woman garnyshed wyth many vertues as the storye declareth.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXXV. CHAPITER.
                     IN processe of tyme after the solemnisacyon of this maryage / complaynte was brought before the kynge of the erles of Cleremoūt and Puy or Puyll, sonne of the duke before rehersyd, and of the erle of Plomet / that they shuld spoyle and wast the chyrches and landes to the sayde chyrches belongynge. For the which dedys the kynge commaunded the sayd .iii. erlys to warde / but not with out warre and shedynge of blood.
                     And after the subduynge of ye sayd thre erlys / a knyght or great man of myght called wyllyam ye erle of Chalon, wyth a company of tyrauntes assembled for to robbe and spoyle the chyrche of saynte Peter of Cluny in Burgoyne. wherof herynge the prestes and mynysters of the chyrche / to the entent to mytygate &amp; to appeace the cruelty of the sayde tyraūtes, dyd vpon them the ornamentes of ye sayd chyrche / and yode agayne them with processyon, wyth a great companye them folowynge of the people of the towne and the countrey there about, in peseable and charytable wyse. But when the sayde tyrauntes approched vnto the sayde cōpany / with out compassyon and pyty, as turkes ranne vppon crysten men, or wyth lesse Pytye / so ranne they vppon the prestes and other, and spoyled them of all the sayde ornamētes / and slew

of that cōpany to the nomber of .v. hū
                        dred or mo / &amp; after spoyled the sayde chyrche, of suche stuffe as was therin lefte. It was not longe after or kynge Lewys had wyttynge of this cruell dede. wherfore in auengynge the chyrche / he gatheryd a conuenyent power and spedde hym thyther. But the sayde wyllyam erle of Chalon herynge of the kynges cōmynge, fled ye coūtrey / so yt the kyng myght haue no certayne knowlege where he became. wherfore the kyng entred and seased his landes, and gaue the moyty therof to ye duke of Burgoyn as chefe lorde of that soyle / and that other halfe he gaue vnto the erle of Neuers, to whose auncetry in tyme passed the sayd moyty apperteyned. And that done he commaunded inquyry to be made of his accessaryes / the prebensons or prebendars of the whyche he punyshed by dyuerse maner of tormentes and dethes, to the great contentacyon of the countrey.
                     when the kynge hadde thus fynished this vyage and was returned into Fraunce / soon after was knowlege brought vnto him, that the Burgonyons &amp; men of the towne of Uerdeley, rebelled agayne the hed chyrch or abbay of that towne / and entēdyd to haue done some vylany to the abbot and munkes of the same / wherfore the kynge spedde hym thyther in all haste. But for theyr sauergarde the munkes were compelled to fortyfye the chyrche, and to defende them by force of armys / so that betwene them and the Burgonions many an arbalaster and stone was shot &amp; cast. And for the kynge myght not so hastly furnyshe hym of his soldyours / he therfore sent vnto the erle of Neuers by whose meane as to the kyng was shewed this ryot began / commaundynge hym that he shuld se this ryot appeased, and that the chyrch of Uerdeley were restored of suche harmys as to theym was done by the inhabytauntes of the towne. But of thys cō
                        maundement the erle set but lytle / so that the burgeses perseuered in theyr erroure. wherfore the abbot sente agayne to the kynge / besechyng hym of his moste gracyouse ayde and socoure. Then the kynge herynge of the erles dysobedyence, was therwyth greatly dyspleasyd / and suspected ye erle to be partye in the cause, &amp; sped hym ye faster thetherwarde. But when the erle was enfourmed of the kynges cōmynge he somdeale feryd / and mette wyth the kynge at a place called Moret, and there demeaned hym in suche wyse, that the kyng forgaue his offense. Then he promysed that the kynges pleasure shulde be fullfylled in all thynge as he hadde before cōmaunded, wyth more as yt lyked hym to dyuyse. Uppon whych promyse so made / he commaunded that the Burgonyons shulde fyrste refrayne theym of that rebellyon agayn the chyrch / and that they shuld newly be sworne to be obedient vnto the abbot and vnto hys successours as theyr p̄decessours had ben / &amp; ouer that for the hurtes &amp; harmys yt they had done to the place at that season, they shulde paye to the sayde abbot and couēt .lx. thousand sous. A sous is in value after sterlyng money i.d. ob / so that .lx. thousand sous amounteth in sterlyng money .iii. hundred &amp; lxxv. pounde. After whych ende thus made / the kynge retourned into Fraunce.
                     It was not longe after, that ye kyng receyued of quene Alys hys wyfe a sonne, and named yt Phylyppe. But for ye kyng Lewys had made many pylgrymages, and vsed many ways of charyte, in gyuynge of almes and otherwyse; for to haue a sonne to be his heyre / therfore he surnamed this

chylde A dieu done, a chyld gyuen of god. Then thys Lewys for the intollerable dedes of the Iewes whiche in these dayes had great inhabytynge wyth in the lande of Fraūce, &amp; vsed vsery &amp; sleynge of Crysten chyldren / he ponyshed many by deth, and many he banyshed his lande / but yet many remayned.
                     Of this Lewys dedes is lytle more cronacled / excepte when his son Philyppe was of the age of .xiii. yeres, his fader caused hym to be crowned, and resygned to hym all the rule of the lande / and dyed the yere folowynge at Parys in the moneth of October, in the yere of grace .xi. hūdred and .lxxix. By whyche reason he reygned, to reken from his faders deth to his owne, vppon .xliii. yeres / and was rychely enterred by ye meane of his last wife at the monastery of Barbell / the whyche he founded in hys yonge days. After whose deth ye sayd quene Alys adorned his sepulture in the moste rychest maner, wyth gold, syluer, and precyous gemmys / vppon whose tombe was grauen these two versis folowyng, as a counsayll left vnto his sonne Phylyppe.

                        HEnry the second of that named, &amp; sonne of Geffrey Plātagenet erle of Angeou, and of Molde ye empresse doughter of Henry ye first, began hys reygn ouer the realme of England, in the moneth of October, the yere of our lorde god .xi. hundred and .lv / and. ye xix. yere of Lewys the viii. then kynge of Fraunce. Thys Henry was somdeale redde of face, &amp; brode of breste, shorte of body, &amp; therwyth fatte / the whych to aswage he toke the lesse of metes and drynkes, and exercysed myche huntynge. He was resonable of speche and well lettered &amp; orped, and also noble in knyghthode, wyse in counsayll, and dred to myche distenyes. He was also free and lyberall to straūgers, and harde and holdynge from hys famylyers &amp; seruauntes. And whome he loued enterely or hated / harde it was to turne hym to the contrary. He was slowe of answere, vnstedfaste of promyse, gylefull of dede, open spouse breker, hamour of holy chyrch, and alwayes vnkynde to god. He also loued reste and peace, to the ende he myghte the more folowe hys delectacyon &amp; pleasure / wyth mo vyces rehersed by Gyralde, the whyche for length I passe ouer. This Henry yet, as wytnessyth Ranulfe, was not all bareyn of vertues. For he was of so gret courageousnes, that he wolde often say that all the world suffysyth not to a coragyous harte. And he encreasyd hys herytage so myghtyly, that he wanne Irlande by strength / and toke wyllyam kynge of Scottes, and ioyned that kyngdome to his owne. From

the suthe Occean to the north ylandes of Orkeys / he closed all the landes as yt were vnder one pryncypate / and spradde so largely hys empyre, that men rede not of none of hys progenytours that hadde so many prouynces and countreys vnder theyr domynyon and rule. For besyde the realme of Englande / he hadde in hys rule Normandy, Gascoyn, and Guyan, Angeou and Chynon. And he made subiecte to hym Aluerne and other landes. And by hys wyfe, he obteyned as her ryghte the mountes and hyllys of Spayne called montes Pyrany. Of the whyche wyfe Elynoure by name, deuorced, as before ys sayde, from the viii. Lewys kynge of Fraunce / he receyued .vi. sonnes and thre doughters. Of the sonnes fyue were named wyllyam, Henry, Rycharde, Godfrey, and Iohn̄. The eldeste of the maydens hight Molde or Maude, and was maryed to the duke of Saxon / the seconde Elyanoure to the kynge of Spayne / and the thyrd named Iane, to wyllyam kynge of Scycyle.
                     Thys Henry was prosperouse in hys begynnynge, and vnfortunate in hys ende, and specyally in the last fyue yeres of hys reygne. For in the fyrst of those fyue yeres, his strength beganne to mynyshe / the seconde yere he loste a vyage in Irlande / the thyrde he loste Aluerne agayne the kynge of Fraunce / the fourth yere he loste Butyrycan / and the fyfte yere he loste the cytye of Cenomenea and Turon, wyth many holdes to theym belongynge.
                     Thys Henry the seconde ascertayned of the deth of Stephan / spedde hym into Englande / and was crowned the sondaye before Crystemasse daye of Theobalde archbyshoppe of Caunterbury in westmynster chyrch.
                     The fyrste yere of hys reygne he subdued Irlande. And soone after Thomas Beketh, whyche after was byshoppe of Caunterbury, was made chaunceller of Englonde. This kynge caste downe dyuers castellys, that before in tyme of kynge Stephan were buylded / other for dyspleasure of the owners, or ellys for the fere they shulde be strengthed agayne hym. And also he banyshed many of the lordes and gentylmen, that kynge Stephan hadde in hys fauoure.
                     Aboute the thyrde yere of hys reygne in the moneth of October, were sene in the fyrmament two sunnys / and in the mone was sene a redde crosse. But of thys wonder sheweth the authoure of Cronica cronicarū / and sayth that aboute thys tyme in Italy in the moneth of Nouember, appered thre sunnys by the space of thre owres in the weste / and the yere folowynge appered thre monys, whereof the myddle mone hadde a redde crosse ouerthwarte the face. whyche there ys noted for a prodygy or a token of the scysme, that after fell amonges the cardinallys for eleccyon of the pope Alexāder the thyrd / whyche scysme by meane of the fyrste Frederyke then emperoure, endured almoste .xx. yeres.
                     Also aboute this tyme Adryan the fourthe of that name was pope, an Englysheman borne in the towne of saynte Albon of whome is more declared in the begynnynge of the .xxii. chapyter of the .vii. boke of Polycronycon.
                     Also in thys yere the kynge wente wyth a stronge armye into walys / and after he hadde sette that countrey in an order and quyet, he buyldyd a stronge castell at Rutlande,

and founded the abbaye of Basyngewerke.
                     In the .vi yere of hys reygne / thys Henry maryed hys seconde son Henry, vnto the kynges doughter of Fraūce, that is to meane Lewys the viii / whyche the sayde Lewys receyued of hys seconde wyfe named Constaunce, the doughter of the kyng of Spayne, as before ye haue harde in the seconde chapyter of ye story of the sayd Lewys. This mayden was named Margaret. By reason of whych maryage, was appeased the warre that was begonne betwene Fraunce and Englande for the landes of Poy
                        
                           •
                        owe and other, the whyche kynge Henry helde by reason of hys wyfe. In ye whych warre mych harme was done / and more wolde haue ensued, yf yt hadde not by thys meane haue ben agreed.
                     In the .vii. yere of his reygn, Theobalde archbyshoppe of Caunterbury dyed / and Thomas Beket chaunceller of Englande was archebysshoppe▪ after hym, of whome more shall folowe.
                     In the same yere kyng Henry with a stronge hoste yode to Scotlande / and made so cruell warre vppon willyam kynge of that lande, that lastely he was taken / and dyd to the sayd Henry recompensacyon, in yeldynge vnto hym the cytye of Carlell, the castell of Bamburghe, the newe castell vpon Tyne, wyth dyuers other holdes / and a great parte of Northumberlande, the whyche he hadde wonne from the borderers. And after fewtye and homage done by the sayde wyllyam vnto the kynge, and a certayne summe of money by hym promysed wythin .ix. monethes folowynge / the kynge suffred hym to go at large. But an other authour sayth, that the kynge of Scottys was not taken / but strongely besyeged in a towne or castell, so that fynally he was forced to agree to the foresayde couenauntes.
                     In the .viii. yere, the cytye of Caū
                        terburye was fyred by neglygence, &amp; a great part therof brente. And in that season, the archbyshoppe Thomas beganne to replye agayne ye kynges mynde, for thynges that the kynge dyd exercyse agayn the liberties of the chyrche.

                        IN the .ix. yere of hys reygne / the kynge for dyuerse causes cōcernyng ye nedes of his realme, called a parliament at hys towne of Northampton. Durynge whyche parlyament / dyssencyon fell betwen the kynge and Thomas archbyshop of Caunterburye, for dyuerse actes and ordinaunces that the kyng there procured, to passe agayne the lybertyes of holy chyrch / the whych Thomas gaynstode and denyed. wherfore the kynge toke a great dyspleasure with Thomas / in so myche that shortely after he was fayne to flee the lande / and in processe of tyme spedde hym to Rome, where he complayned hym to Alexaunder the .iii. of that name then pope / and there contynued, and in Fraunce, and in other places, in poore estate by terme of .vi. yeres and more. when kynge Henry hadde certayne vnderstandynge, that Thomas was thus departed out of hys lande / he seased

his maners and temporall landes into hys hande / so that hys mouable goodes were spoyled and rauenyd amonge the kynges offycers.
                     In the .xiiii. yere of his reygne / the kynge crowned Henry hys eldest sonne then lyuynge kynge of Englande at westmynster. whyche was done to the derogacyon or harme of the archbyshoppe Thomas, as yt is wytnessyd in hys legende / and for that doynge Roger archbyshoppe of yorke whyche crowned hym was accursed. But an other authour sayth that the kynge crowned Henry hys sonne, to the ende he myght haue ful power and authoryte to rule thys lande and the people of the same, whyle hys father was occupyed in Normandye and other countreys, where hys landes laye.
                     In myche of thys season that thys blessyd man Thomas was thus banyshed the lande / the kynge sente ouer byshoppes and proctours, to complayne vppon hym to the pope / for well nere all the bishoppes of Englande were agayne hym. And yf any toke hys parte, they durste not speke for the displeasure of theyr temporall lorde / so that this blessed man defended the quarell of the chyrche alone.
                     In the .xvi. yere of ye reygne of kyng Henry / Lewys the kynge of Fraūce, agreed kynge Henry and the archbysshoppe, the kynge then beynge in Normandye. Uppon whyche agrement thys blessyd man came to hys owne chyrche of Caunterbury / and there so restynge hym, sente for such persones as had spoyled and taken perforce the goodes of the chyrche / aduertysynge theym by fayre meanes to restore the sayde goodes, and to be reconcyled to the chyrche as trewe crysten men shulde. But when he sawe that he myght not reconcyle theym by fayre meanes / he then vsed compulsaryes, and denounced them accursed but if they restored the goodes of the chyrche by a certayne day. wherewyth the partyes beynge agreued / sayled ouer to the kynge into Normandye / and shewyd vnto hym greuous complayntes, and more greuouse then the cause or mater requyred. For the whych, the kynge which hadde not yet quenched the bronde of malyce in hys harte the whyche he bare agayne thys holy man, gaue lyght credence vnto those complayntes, and was sore &amp; feruētly amoued agayne the holy man Thomas / in so myche that vppon a daye herynge the complayntes of this blessyd mannes aduersaryes, he sayd in oppē audyence of hys knyghtes, that yf he had any good knyghtes about hym, he had ben aduēged of that traytour longe or that tyme. At the tyme of whyche wordes vtterynge / was present syr wyllyam Bryton, syr Hugh Moruyle, syr wyllyam Tracy, and syr Regnolde fytz Urle. whych foure knyghtes, thynkyng that they shuld to theyr mayster do a synguler pleasure yf they slewe thys blessyd man / hastely takynge aduyse eche of them of other, of one wyll and mynde toke shyppyng and sayled to Douer / and in all haste spedde theym vnto Caunterburye / where the .v. daye of Cristmasse they executed theyr tyrannye, and martyred that blessyd archebysshoppe at that aulter of sayne Benet wythin hys owne chyrche, in the yere of our lordes incarnacyon a thousande, a hundred, and .lxx, as yt ys wytnessyd by these versys folowyng

                     The whych is to vnderstande in our

vulgare / as thus.

                           ¶The yere, to reken from Crystes incarnacyon,
                           A thousande an hundred and seuentye therunto / 
                           The prymate of Englande wyth great abomynacyon,
                           was slayne wyth sworde, Thomas that wolde not do
                           The kynges hest, whyche erred the ryghte fro
                           Of the chyrche and lybertyes of the same.
                           wherby of honoure he wanne perpetuall fame.
                        
                     
                     After this cruell dede thus by the foure knyghtes done, wherwyth the kynge after some wryters was not contented / the kynges fortune beganne to decreace and fall / so that he hadde after thys many aduersyteys, where before he knewe not of lyke trouble.
                     In the .xvii. yere of his reygne, the kynge made a iourney into Irland / where wyth great trauayle he subdued the Iryshe. And after wyth helpe of the prymate and byshoppe of Arnache, he refourmed the maner of the dwellers and people of that countrey, and that in thre thynges specyally. Fyrste in rulynge and orderynge of the chyrche by the curates, &amp; how they shuld order theyr dy / uyne seruyce, and mynyster the sacramente of matrymonye as yt was in Englande and other crysten regyons. The seconde was, how that the laye people shuld behaue theym to theyr curates, and what wyse they shulde paye and offer to god theyr tythes. The thyrde was for makyng of theyr testamentes. Thys was ordeyned that euery man shulde make hys laste wyll in p̄sence of his neyghbours / or at leste cause yt to be rede in theyr presence. And fyrste he shuld reken what he ought / and to sette so myche of hys goodes. And yf he had a wyfe and chyldren, then the resydue of hys goodes hys dettys beyng payde to be deuyded in thre partes / one to the wyfe, the seconde for the chyldren, and the thyrde to be spente for the weale of the soule. And yf he hadde no chyldren / then the halfe to hys soule, and that other halfe to his wyfe. And yf he hadde no wyfe nor chyldren / then to dyspose hys goodes at hys pleasure.
                     In the returne of the kynge oute of Irlande / was a wonder thynge shewed vnto hym vppon whytesondaye, whyche in the calender is called dominica in Albys. whē the kyng shuld take his horse / sodeynly appered vnto hym a man of pale &amp; wanne colour barefote, and in a whyte kyrtell / the whyche bodely spake vnto the kynge in the langage of duche / and sayde syr kynge, Criste greetyth the wele, and hys mylde moder mary, with also Iohn̄ Baptyst and Peter / and commaunde the streyghtly that no Markettes, nor seruyle workes be holden vppon the sondaye in the landes of thy lordeshyppe, oute take that longeth to dressynge of mete. And yf thou do after thys byddynge / I assure the that all thynge that thou begynnest to good entent or of good purpose, thou shalt bryng yt to good ende. The kynge lyked nothynge thys speche / and sayd to the knyghte that helde hys brydell, Aske of thys chorle whether he haue dremed all thys that he telleth. wherunto thys man answered, whyther I haue mette thys tale in my dreme or not / take thou hede well of my saynge. For and thou do not as I haue aduertysed the, &amp; amende thy lyfe / thou shalte shortely here

suche thynges that thou shalte be heuy fore to thy lyues ende. The kyng toke all in game / and the man vanyshed sodeynly, that the kyng &amp; his knyghtes wonderyd of hys departynge. wherof when the kynge was warned, both of hys fyrste sodeynly apperynge, and of hys departynge / the kynge sette yt nere hys mynde, and entendyd to do some thynges after that mannys counsayll. But how yt was yt had no forwarde.
                     After that the blessed man Thomas was martyred / the munkes by assent of the kynge, chase Rycharde pryour of Douer / the whyche was a man of euyll lyuynge, and wasted the goodes of ye chyrch inordynatly.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXXVIII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        ABoute the .xx. yere of the kynges reygne / he purchased a dyspensacyon for the vyage that before he hadde solempnely auowed before .ii. cardynallys, to go into the holy lande, and to ieoperde hys proper persone agaynst Crystes enymyes. The whyche dyspensacyon was grauntyd vppon one condycyon, that he shulde buylde thre abbays in Englande. In fulfyllynge wherof the kynge put oute of the howse of waltham seculer chanons / and set there in theyr stede chanons reguler. And for the seconde he auoyded the munkes oute of the house of Aumbrysbury / and sette there menchons that he hadde brought from beyonde the see. And for the thyrde he renewed coursely the charter house of wytham besyde Salysburye. By whyche thre dedes he thought hym selfe excused of hys former promyse.
                     Then beganne his sonnes to make warre vppon hym, the whyche were ayded by the Scottyshe kynge and the two erles of Chester and of Lyncolne. The cause of whyche warre was after the declaracyon of some wryters, for so myche as the kynge hadde emprysoned Elyanoure hys wyfe, and kepte that wenche Rosamounde agayne all good order. But other say yt was for certayne landes in Normandye / whyche by ayde of the Frenche kynge, Rycharde the .iii. sonne of byrthe and seconde then lyuynge, wolde haue taken from hys father. Of thys warre speketh nothynge the frenche cronycle.
                     Then as testyfyeth Ranulfe / this innaturall warre endured by the terme of two yeres, to the great dysturbaunce of the kynge and of hys realme / tyll the kynge wyth great deuocyon vysyted the graue of the holy martyr saynte Thomas. After whyche pylgrymage was by hym fynysshed / in shorte processe after wyllyam kynge of Scottes, and the two forenamed erlys of Chester and Lyncolne, were taken at the castell of Anwyke. But yet he lefte not the company of the forenamed Rosamunde / to the whych wenche he hadde made an house of wonder workyng, so that no creature man or woman myghte wynne to her but yf he were instructe by the kynge or suche as were ryght secrete with hym touchynge that mater. Thys house after some wryters was named Labyrinthus or Dedalus worke or house, whyche ys to meane after moste exposytours, an howse wroughte lyke vnto a knot in a garden called a mase. But the common fame telleth, that lastely the quene wan to her by a clew of threde

or sylke / and delte wyth her in suche maner, that she lyued not longe after. Of the maner of her deth spekyth nothynge myne authoure / but when she was dede she was buryed at the howse or monasterye of Goddestow besyde Oxenforde, with these versys vppon her toumbe.

                           Hic iacet in tūba Rosa mūdi, sed nō rosa mūda.
                           Non redolet sed olet, quae redolere solet.
                        
                     
                     The whythe versys, to our vnderstandynge may thus as folowyth be englyshed and expowned.

                           The Rose of the worlde, but not the clene floure.
                           Is here now grauen / to whom bewtye was lent.
                           In thys graue full darke nowe ys her bowre,
                           That by her lyfe was swete and redolent.
                           But now yt she is frō this lyfeblente / 
                           Though she were swete, nowe fowly doth she stynke / 
                           A myrrour good for all that on her thynke.
                        
                     
                     Longe tyme after the deth of the sayde Rosamounde, in the sayde abbaye was shewed a cofer of the sayd wenches of the length of two fote / in whych apperyd fyghtynge geaūtes, stertlynge of bestes, swymmynge of fyshes, and flyenge of fowlys.
                     In the forsayde .xx. yere after the opynyon of Guydo / the kynge had the seconde monicyon of mendynge of hys lyfe, by an Iryshe man yt told vnto hym many secret tokens, whyche the kynge supposyd no man had knowen but hym selfe. But yet the kynge toke lytell hede therunto.
                     In the .xxii. yere of his reygne, after the forsayde takynge of ye Scottyshe kynge and .ii. erlys / the .xi. day before Septēber, wyllyam kynge of Scottys by assent of the lordes spyrytuall and temporall, dyd homage to kyng Henry at hys cytye of yorke. where the sayde wyllyam graunted by hys letters patentys, that he and his successours kynges of Scotland, shuld make theyr homage and fydelyte vnto the kynges of Englande as often as they shalbe necessaryly requyred. And in sygne and token of that subieccyon / the kyng of Scottes offered hys hatte &amp; his sadell vppon the aulter of saint Peter in ye chyrch of york. whyche for a remembraunce of that dede / the sayd hat &amp; sadell were there kepte many yeres after. And ouer yt the lordes of Scotland swore, that if theyr kynge at any tyme wold wythdrawe hym from allegeaunce / they wold all aryse agayn hym, and be to hym as enymyes, tyll he were returned to his fayth &amp; kepyng of his promyse. And for the more strēgth of the sayd cōposycyon, the kynge of Scottis came after to ye kyng Henries parlyament holden at Northāpton, and a nother season into Normandye.
                     Ranulfe munke of Chester sayth, that Lewys the .viii. of that name kynge of Fraunce / delyueryd vnto kynge Henry a doughter of hys to haue in guydynge, and to haue ben maryed vnto Rycharde hys son / the whyche after the deth of Rosamoūde he defloured of her vyrgynyte. After whyche dede, as affermyth the sayde authoure, the kynge was in wyll to haue wedded that damoysell. For expedicyon wherof he made great meanes ta Hugūcia a cardynall then beynge in his land, that he wold make a dyuorce betwene hym and Elyanoure the quene. And thys he dyd, to the ende to haue the more fauoure of the Frenchemen, that by theyr ayde he myghte the better dysheryte hys sonnes. But he fayled of his purpose and also yt turned to hys owne harme. For by this means, he caused the

sayde Rycharde hys sonne to shewe all hys demeanour vnto the Frenche kynge / so that by hys informacyon vnkyndnesse kyndled betwene them two / &amp; therof ensued mortall warre, as sayth the englyshe cronycle, and also Polycronycon. But of thys warre speketh nothynge the frenche cronycle / nor of none other durynge the lyfe of the sayd Lewys after this daye, which dyed in the .xxiiii. yere of thys Henry. But the warre that was betwen the two kynges of England and of Fraunce / was betwene thys Henry and Phylyppe sonne of thys Lewys, as after shalbe shewed.
                     About the .xxiiii. yere of thys kyng as wytnessen dyuerse wryters / fell wonderfull wederynge and tempest of thunder in myddewynter tyme in Hampshyre and other places / by violence wherof a preste amonges other was slayn. And in the somer folowynge about Mary Magdalene tyde, fell hayle of suche bygnesse, yt yt slew both men and bestes. And about this tyme were the bonys of kynge Arture and his wyfe Gueynour founde in the vale of Aualon / whose here of the hed of the sayde Gweynour was then hole and of freshe coloure / but so soone as yt was touched, yt fell in powder. whyche bonys were translated and buryed wythin the chyrche of Glastenburye / and were founden by a synger of gestis vnder an holow oke .xv. fote wythin the grounde. whyche fyndynge and translatynge is an obiecte to ye fantastycall sayeng of the walshemen, that afferme hys commynge agayne to reygne as he before dyd.
                     Then hadde kynge Henry the seconde monycyon by a knyghte called syr wyllyam Chesterby or Lyndesey / the whyche warned hym specyally for the reformacyon of .vii. artycles. The fyrste was, that he shuld sette better dylygence to the defence of holy chyrche / and maynteynynge of the same. The seconde, that he shulde se hys lawes executed, wyth better iustice then at those days was vsed. The thyrd was, that he shuld surmyse no mater agayn ryche men / and by that mean plucke from them theyr landes &amp; goodes. The fourth that he shulde restore all suche landes and goodes gotten by suche vnlawfull meanes or by any other. The fyfte, that he shuld for no medetarye ryghtfull sentence / but suffer the ryght to haue hys processe. The vi, that he shulde se to the payment of hys subiectes for suche stuffe as was dayly taken to his vse / &amp; also to the payment of hys seruauntes and souldyours wages, whych dayly fell to robbynge for defaute. The .vii. and the laste was, that he shulde in all haste voyde the Iewys of hys lande, whyche dayly wrought great sorowe to his commons / and to leue theym somwhat to spende in theyr iourney. But as he toke the other monycyons, so he toke thys / and cōtynued hys lyfe as he before hadde done.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXXXIX. CHAPITER.
                     
                        IN the .xxviii. yere of his reygn after moste writers, dyed Henry his eldeste sonne then lyuynge / ye whych as before is sayde was crowned to the derogacyon of the martyr saynte Thomas. And in thys yere / whyche shulde be the .iiii. yere of Phylyppe the seconde, or of Phylyppe surnamed Gyuen of god / the warre beganne betwene kynge Henry and hym. wherof was occasyon

as testyfyeth the sayd Frenche cronycle, the denyenge of the deferrynge of homage, that shuld be done to the sayde Phylyppe of Rycharde then eldest sonne of kyng Henry / for the lādes of Poytow. An other cause also was / that where certayne couenauntes were stablyshed and enrolled betwene kynge Henry and Lewys father of thys Phylyp, at the maryage of Henry his sonne and Margarete syster of Phylyppe, for certayne holdes and castellys wherof ye castell of Gysours was one / whych were delyueryd in dower wyth the sayde Margarete, vppon condycyon that yf the sayde Henry hadde yssue by ye sayde Margarete, then the sayde castellys to remayne to the sayde heyres / and yf the sayde yonge Henry dyed without yssue of ye sayde Margarete, that then the sayde castellys and holdes to be reuerted vnto the crowne of Fraunce: and for that kynge Henry denyed or deferred these two poyntes, and wold not answere when he was called / the Frenche kynge therfore entred the land of Barry wyth great strength; and wasted the countrey of Guyan wythout mercy. wherof kynge Henry beynge warned / in all haste assembled hys people then beynge in Normandye, and d
                           •
                        ew hym towarde the Frenche kynge / whyche then hadde layde syege vnto the castell called in frenche Raoull, or the castell of Roaull.
                     when both hostes were nere and lykely to haue ioyned / medyatours were sente vppon bothe partyes to treate a peace. By meane wherof in processe a trewce was taken for a certayne terme / so that eyther hoste departed wythoute strykynge of stroke at that season.
                     About thys tyme dyed Rycharde archebyshoppe of Caunterbury. Of hym yt is redde that a voyce or vysyon was shewed to hym, saynge to hym in the mouthe of Cryste: For thou haste wasted the goodes of my chyrch, I shal rote the out of ye erthe. with which wordes he was so frayd, that he dyed shortly after. Then was Baldewyn byshoppe of worceter admytted to that see, though the munkys of Caunterburye wythsayde yt wyth all theyr power.
                     In the .xxx. yere of the kynge / Heraclius patryarke of Hierusalem came in to England, to haue ayde agayne the Sarazyns that had wonne great parte of the landes that Cristen men had in the holy lande / and for to defende the holy cytye, whyche by Saladyne prynce of Surey was wonne shortely after. For by the reporte of Peter Dysroy, whyche made a boke in frenche of the wynnynge and losynge of the sayde cytye / yt appereth that yt was wōne by Godfrey de Bulyon, in the yere of Crystes incarnacyon a thousande .lxxx. and .xix / and so cōtynued vnder the rule of .ix. crysten kynges, tyll the laste kynge named Guyde Lesyngham or Lesynguam loste yt wyth the holy crosse, in the yere of our lorde .xi. hundred lxxx. and .ix. whych maketh the yere of the reygn of thys kyng Henry the xxxiiii. Then yt foloweth in the story / this Heraclius made besy request vnto the kynge for ayde, and profered to hym the keys of the cytye and of our lordes graue / and letters of Luciꝰ ye thyrd of yt name then pope, chargyng him that he shuld take vppon hym ye iourney, &amp; to haue mynde of the othe yt he before time had made. The kyng deferred this answere and Baldwyne the archbyshop preached &amp; exhorted men to take ye crosse / by whose meanes many there were ye
                        
auowed that iourney. Lastely the kynge gaue answere, and sayde that he myghte not leue hys lande wythoute kepynge / nor yet leue yt to the praye and robbory of Frenchemen. But he wolde gyue largely of hys owne, to suche as wolde take vppon theym that vyage. wyth thys answere the patryarke was dyscontent / and sayde we seke a man and not money. welnere euery crysten regyon sendyth vnto vs money / but no lande sendyth to vs a prynce. Therfore we aske a prynce that nedeth money / and not money that nedeth a prynce. But the kynge layde for hym suche excuses, that the patryarke departed from hym dyscontentyd and comfortelesse. wherof the kynge beynge aduertysed / entendynge somwhat to recomforte hym wyth pleasaunte wordes, folowed hym vnto the see syde. But the more the kynge thought to satysfye hym wyth hys fayre speche, the more the patryarke was dyscontented / in so myche that at the laste he sayde vnto hym. Hytherto thou haste reygned gloryously. But here after thou shalt be forsaken of him yt thou at thys tyme forsakeste. Thynke on hym what he hath gyuen to the / and what thou haste yelden to hym agayne. Howe fyrste thou were false vnto the kyng of Fraunce / and after slewe that holy man Thomas of Caunterburye / and lastely thou forsakeste the proteccyon of Crystes fayth. The kyng was amoued wyth these wordes, &amp; sayde vnto the patriarke. Though all the men of my lande were one bodye, and spake wyth one mouth / they durste not speke to me such wordys. No wonder sayde the patryarke, for they loue thyne and not the. That ys to meane, they loue thy goodes temporall, and fere the for losse of promocyon / but they loue not thy soule. And when he hadde so sayde / he offeryd hys hedde to the kynge sayenge, Do by me, ryghte as thou dyddest by that blessyd man Thomas of Caunterburye. For I hadde leuer to be slayne of the, then of ye Sarasyns. For thou arte worse then any Sarasyn / and thy people folowyth praye and not a man. But the kynge kepte hys pacyence, and sayde I maye not wende oute of my lande / for myne owne sonnes wyll arryse agayne me when I were absent.A pacyēt man No wonder sayde the patryarke. For of the deuyll they cōme, and to the deuyll they shall / and so departyd from the kynge in great ire. After the patryarke was thus departyd / the kynge sente John̄ his seconde sonne into Irlande. In the whyche vyage he spente the kynge great goodys, and dyd lytle profyte or none.
                     In the .xxxi. yere of kynge Henry / the Iewes crucyfyed a chylde in the towne of Burye in Suff. named Robert / for whome god shewyd after many myracles.
                     And the .xxxii. yere, the kynge made a vyage into Irlande to redresse thynges there oute of order. But fortune was to hym so contrarye that he loste hys trauayle, lyke as the yere before hys sonne Iohn̄ had done.
                     In the .xxxiii. yere of thys kynge Henry / at Dunstable in the ayre was sene a crucyfyxe, and Cryste nayled theron / whyche apperyd vysybly to many a mannys syghte. And in thys yere the kynge loste the countrey of Aluerne / when he hadde spente great goodes aboute the defence of the same. Howe be yt of this warre speketh nothynge the frenche cronycle.
                  
                  
                     
                     THE .CCXI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        IN the .xxxiiii. yere of the kynge / Rycharde the erle of Poytowe arrered warre agayn king Henry hys father, &amp; toke party with the Frenche kynge. By meane of the whyche warre / all suche summys of money as were before gatheryd by dymys and otherwyse, for the helpynge of the croysye to be made into the holy lande, by the sayde Rycharde and by many other nobles of the lande, were spente in the same innaturall warre / wherfore the kynge sayled into Normandy with a strōge armye. But or the kynge were there landed / the sayde Rycharde by helpe of the Frenchemen hadde wonne the cytyes of Towres, of Meaus, and also the castellys of Raoull and Gysours wyth other. At the laste the Frenche kyng Phylyppe the second, wyth the sayde Rycharde came vnto the cytye of Cenomanna / entendyng to laye syege vnto the same. wherof kynge Henry beynge warned / sette the suburbes on fyre, bycause hys enmyes shuld in thē haue no socour. But the flame of the fyre was by the wynde dryuen into the cytye so sharpely, that the kyng was compelled to forsake yt. wherwyth ye kynge was so amoued / that in hys departynge from the cytye he sayde these wordes. For thou haste taken from me thys daye the cytye that I moste loued in the worlde, I shall acquyte the / for after thys tyme I shall bynome the that thynge, yt shuld most haue pleased the in me, whych ys myne harte.
                     After thys he loste more dayly / so that hys enymyes preuayled strongely agayne hym.
                     It is rede of hym / that he shulde be at so great an after deale in thys warre / that hastely he shuld put hym in the kynge of Fraunces mercy, his honoure and hys crowne reserued. But this is doutefull of credēce. For sure I am, yf the Frenche kyng had suche auauntage of hym / yt shulde not haue fallen throughe the boke, but haue ben regystred in the moste auauntynge maner / where as in the frenche cronycle is touched no word of lyke mater. But trowth yt ys that fortune was to him contrary, in such wyse that wyth or for anger and impacyence, he fell into a feuer. wherof he lastely dyed in the castell of Conomeus or of Chynon in Normandye, in the moneth of Iuly, when he had reygned .xxxiiii. yeres and .viii. monethes wyth oddes dayes / and was buryed at Fount Ebrade, wyth thys epytaphy vppon his tombe.

                     Gerardus Cambrens̄, whyche in hys boke of dystynccyons sette oute the lyfe of thys Henry / sayth dredefull yt is to allege agayne hym that maye putte a man oute of lande, and to descrybe hym wyth many wordes, that may exyle a man wyth one worde. wherfore yt were a notable dede to tell the sothe of a prynces dedys, and offende the prynce in no meane. But yet when the prynce ys passed and gone / then men wyll talke without fere, that before tyme they spared for fere.
                     Then to folow the sooth, this kyng Henry noryshed stryfe amonge hys chyldern wyth all dylygēce / hopyng therby to lyue hym selfe in the more reste. when men wolde aske of hym when he wolde leue his great dedes / he vsed to answere that the worlde shulde fayle, or a courageouse harte shulde sease of great dedes. He was pereles in chyualry, in warre, and in lecherye. He wedded Elyanoure wyfe of Lewys kynge of Fraunce / contrary to the commaundement of hys father. For he hadde shewed to hym that he hadde lyen by her, when he was the sayde kynges stewarde.
                     He reygned .xxvi. yeres somdeale to hys wordely blysse, and foure yeres somwhat to hys payne / but the laste fyue yeres to hys great troweble and sorow. Farthermore the sayd Gerarde descryueth the progenye of thys Henry / whyche I ouer passe because yt is so common.
                     Rycharde hys sonne wolde often tell that wonder / and vsed to saye, no meruayle though they greued the peple that were comon of such kynd. For of ye deuyll they came, and to the dyuyll they shall.
                     It ys also redde of thys Henry, that in a chaumber at wyndesore he caused to be paynted an egle wyth foure byrdes / wherof thre of theym all rased the bodye of the olde egle, and the fourth was cratchynge at the olde eglys eyen. when the questyon was asked of hym what thyng that pycture shuld sygnyfye / yt was answered by hym: thys olde egle (sayde he) is my selfe / and these .iiii. eglys betoken my foure sonnes, the whyche sease not to pursue my deth. And specyally my yongeste sonne Iohn̄, whyche nowe I loue moste / shall most specyally awayte and imagen my deth.

                        PHylyp the seconde of that name, surnamed Dyeu done or gyuē of god, and sonne vnto ye viii. Lewys / beganne to reygne ouer the realme of

Fraunce, in the yere of our lorde .xi. hundred and .lxxix / and the .xxiii. yere of Henry the seconde than kynge of Englonde. whyche sayde Phylyppe reygned somwhat of tyme by the lyfe of hys father / which tyme is accompted vnto the reygne of hys father.
                     Thys in the fyrst yere of hys reygne, for the great enormytyes that the Iewes vsed wythin the realme of Fraunce / as crucyfyenge of chyldren, and exercysynge of theyr detestable vsery: he after due profe made put the malefactours to dethe / and the other in auoydynge more daunger / he exyled and put clere out of hys realme.
                     This Phylyp also as before in the story of Henry the seconde is towched, excyted the sonnes of the sayde Henry to make warre vppon theyr father / by whyche meane thys Phylyppe gate many holdes and townes from the sayde Henry wythin hys duchy of Guyon. But after the deth of Henry / thys Phylyppe gaue ouer all the sayde holdes and townes, vnto Rycharde the eldeste sonne of the sayde Henry / and receyued of hym homage for the same. And as wytnessyth the French cronycle / the sayd Rychard in token of obedyence, was present at the coronacion of the sayd Phylyppe. But ye shall vnderstande that than he was not kynge of Englande .x. yeres after. But yf yt so were that he were present at the sayd coronacyon / yet was he duke of Guyon onely.
                     Aboute the thyrde yere of hys reygne / Eraclius patryarke of Hierusalem came into Fraunce, and requyred ayde of thys kynge Phylyppe to wythstande the furye and persecucyon, whyche Saladyne prynce of Turkes hadde excuted and dayly contynued in the countrey of Palestina agayne the Cristen to the great destruccyon of theym and vndoyng of the countrey, and great ieoperdye of the losynge of the holy cytye of Hierusalem. For thys the kynge assembled a great counsayll at hys cytye of Parys / where the sayde Eraclius made requeste to the kynge as before he hadde done to Henry the seconde. For he was in Fraunce in the yere of our lorde .xi. hundred .lxxx. and two / and in Englande he was in the yere of grace .xi. hundred .lxxx. and .vii. After whyche counsayll there so holden / yt was agreed that the kynge wyth ayde of the byshoppes and other of the spyrytualtye, shulde ayde the sayde patryarke / the whyche where sette forthe in all possyble haste. But after the reporte of Peter Dysroye, whyche made a recule or lytle boke of the wynnynge and losyng of Hierusalem / they with mo crysten prynces were dryuen by tempeste of the see vnto the porte of Damas / where vnder coloure of a fayned trewce, they were taken and caste the moste parte of theym in pryson.
                     And when kynge Phylyppe hadde thus delyuered the patryarke / he then gatheryd hys knyghtes and made an armye agayne Hugh duke of Burgoyne / the whyche at that season and tyme hadde beclypped the castell of Uergye wyth a stronge syege / and hadde promysed not to departe thens, tyll such tyme as he had wonne that holde by appoytement or otherwyse.
                     And for the defence of rescouse that myghte be made for the same / he hadde māned foure castellys or towres there vnto adioynaunte, wyth great strength of men of armys. But

after the kynge was thyder comen wyth hys hoste, the sayde towrs were sone ouertourned / and ye kynge wyth a certayne of hys people, of Guy capytayne of the sayde castell of Uergy was ioyously into the same receyued / and rendred to hym the castell, and became hys lege man. where wyth the sayde Hugh beynge

                        ore amoued and dyscontented, seynge there he was dyspoynted of his purpose / departed thens wyth hys ordynaunce and people, and robbed and spoyled the coūtre there aboute / sparynge nother chyrche nor howse of relygyō / in so cruell and greuous maner, that the bysshoppes and abbottes of that partye of Burgoyne made pyteous request vnto the sayd Phylyp, that he of his specyall grace wolde ayde and socoure them and theyr chyrches agayne the tyranny of the sayde duke Hugh. The kynge beynge moued wyth thys pyteous requeste / made sharpe warre vppon the sayde Hugh / and at length wan from hym a stronge castell named Chastelone. where wyth all the duke was put to suche a studyall and fere that he was forsed to seche meanes of treaty and of peace. wherof the cō
                        clusyon was, that he shulde paye vnto the chyrches before by hym hurted &amp; harmed .xxx. thousande pownd. whyche conclusyon taken and surelye sette for the same / the kynge retorned vnto Parys. where the kyng so restynge hym a certeyne of tyme, and hauynge experyence of the intollerable and foule stenches that dayly grewe by the fylthe of the erthe and myre in the stretes / made prouysyon dylygently wyth ayde and helpe of the cytesens, whyche as than hadde londe wythin the cytye, that the stretes were shortely paued after. And at thys tyme whanne the cytye was thus paued, as affermen many authours / the name of it was chaunged from Lutesse or Lewcesse vnto Parysse.

And at spryngynge of the yere / they of one wyll &amp; purpose, toke theyr vyage towarde the holy lande / that ys to wytte that one by water and that other by land / and mette agayne in Cecilia. where the Frēche kynge deꝑted from hym / and so sayled to the sayde cytye of Acone or Acre, and layde hys syege there vnto. In whych pastyme kyng Rycharde warred vppon the kynge of Sypres, &amp; hym wyth his land subdued / &amp; after came vnto Acon̄, where the Frenche kyng had longe lyen at syege without gettynge of any great auauntage of his enymyes / saynge vnto kynge Rycharde that he hadde spared the wynnynge of the towne tyll hys commynge, to the ende that he at his commyng myght be parteyner as well of the honoure as of the wynnynge. But how it was, such vnkyndenesse fell betwene theym there, after they hadde woonne the sayde towne, as after in story of kynge Rycharde shalbe shewed, that this kyng Phylyppe retourned into Fraunce shortely after. In the whych returne the sayde Phylyppe sykened, and the duke of Burgoyne dyed. And when kyng Phylyppe a season had soiourned in Fraūce / he maryed Iugebert the doughter of the kynge of Denmarke. The whyche maryage, as sayth Ranulfe, was desyred of the Frenche kynge, to haue wyth her graunted the tytle whyche the Danes had vnto the crown of England, wyth also .x. thousand markes of syluer, for to wynne wyth ye sayd ryght and tytle. But yt was not longe or

she were frō hym deuorced, for cause of alyaūce of gossypred or otherwise. Howe be yt in processe of tyme after / the said Iugebert was to him agayn ioyned by the authoryte of Pope Innocent the thyrd of that name, in the yere of grace .xii. hūdred and .ix. and yere of reygne of this Philyppe .xxx / so that the sayde Iugebert was deuorced frome her lorde by the terme of .xvii. yeres or theruppon.
                     In whych tyme and season the sayd Phylyppe had maryed the doughter of Phylyppe duke of Sweuy, that then was returned vnto her father.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXLIII. CHAPITER.
                     Kynge Phylyp for dyspleasure whych he bare towarde kyng Rycharde / made sharpe and cruell warre vpon the Normans, and wan therein dyuerse holdes and townes / and fynally layde syege vnto the cytye of Roan. wherof herynge Iohn̄ erle of Huntyngeton, or after some erle of Oxenforde brother to kynge Rycharde, whome the Frenche boke nameth Iohn̄ withoute lande / wyth the erle of Arundell and other noble men, spedde hym into Normandye / and so ayded the cytezens and the soldyours of Roan, that as testyfyeth the frēche cronycle, the French kyng was so moued wyth the warre and defence of the same towne, that in a passynge fury consyderyng the wynter season drewe vppon, and that he myght not carye awaye his gunnes and other great ordynaunces / he set all vppon a fyre / and so wyth great agony departed. And within thre monethes after he layde syege vnto the castell of Uernyel / where whē he had lyen .iii. wekes or more, a messynger came vnto hym and sayde, that the cytye Euroux was taken of the Normans / and the people therof taken prysoners. wherfore in all haste he departed, and rescued the sayd cytye and prysoners / and that done retourned to the foresayde syege / and assyeged yt so strōgely, that lastely he had yt delyueryd by appoyntement.
                     By thys season was kynge Rycharde delyueryd out of the handes of the duke of Ostryge. And then beganne the warre to be more cruell / whych here I passe ouer, for so mych as I entende to shew the effecte therof in the storye of kynge Rycharde folowynge.
                     Aboute the .xviii. yere of the reygn of thys Phylyppe / fell such plenty of water, that the groūde was therwith so bucked and drowned, that corne &amp; other frutes by reason therof greatly decayed and scanted, in such wyse that whete was shortly after at .xx.s a quarter after sterlynge money.
                     In the .xx. yere of the reygn of this Phylyppe / dyed Rycharde kynge of England / to whom was heyre Iohn̄ before named his brother. The whyche cōcluded a trewce wyth this Philyppe for certayne yeres, as after in the storye of this Iohn̄ shall more clerely appere.
                     And soone there after meanes were made to kyng Phylyp, that he shuld receyue agayne vnto his company Iugebert hys wyfe / and to renounce Mary doughter of the duke of Sweuy, or after some authours, the doughter of the duke of Bohemy. But the kynge wyth this mocyon was nothynge contentyd / nor yet agreable to folow any such mocion or request. wherfore the prelasy of the lande assemled theym in counsayll / and by a full and hole authoryte, seynge they myghte not induce the kynge to no conformyte or agrement to resume hys lawfull wyfe, and to refuse that

other / they denounsed hym and hys realme accursed. wherwith the kyng was so amoued and vexed / that he depryued certayne bysshoppes from theyr sees / and also toke in hys possessyon the spyrytuall goodes / and prysoned many prestes and other relygyous men / and ouer that closed the sayde Iugebert wythin the castell of Sampys / and forthermore greued hys comons wyth greuous exaccyons and taxys. Than wythin a shorte terme after Iohn̄ de saynte Poule cardynall, and Athā or Othemon bysshoppe of Osty and legate of the pope of Rome, wyth the archebysshoppe of Burdeaux and other / by the commaundement of the pope than Innocent the thyrde, kepte a greate counceyle in the cytye of Sorsore. where the kynge was monysshed to apere / for so mych as before he hadde graunted to be reconcyled vnto hys fyrste wyfe. where thys mater hynge in argument before the spyrytuall iudges by ye space of .xv. dayes, wythout sentence gyuynge. wherfore the kynge beynge wyth the delayes dyscontented / sodenly wyth hys wyfe departed, wythout takynge of them any congye or leue / sendynge them vnderstandyng that as yet he wolde be aduysed or he were dysseuered from hys wyfe. wherof whan the sayd Iohn̄ cardynall and the other bysshoppes hadde wyttynge / accomptynge theyr laboure loste, they retourned shortely after vnto Rome, and shewed vnto the pope all as they hadde done.
                     And soone there after kyng Iohn̄ was honorably receyued of thys kynge Phylyppe, as in the story of the sayd Iohn̄ shall be more playnly shewed.
                     And in the yere folowynge, which shulde be in the begynnynge of the xxiii. yere of thys Phylyppe, dyed Mary hys wyfe / whyche he wrongfully had holden cōtrary to the law of the chyrche by the terme of tenne yeres or there vppon. Of the whyche Mary he hadde receyued a man chylde and a doughter / the whyche after were made legyttymate by Innocent the thyrde, though some noble men of Fraunce there agayne grudged.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXLIIII. CHAPITER.
                     
                        IT was not longe after, that ye kyng assembled greate people and entendyd to haue entred the landys of the erle Rossell, &amp; o
                           •
                         Roger de Rose / of the whyche he hadde broughte before hym many greuous complayntes, of greate extorcyons and exaccyōs that the sayd erle and Roger hadde executed and done vppon the chyrches nere to the valey of Soysons / and wolde not refrayne for all the kynges cōmaundement. wherfore he rygged hys armye and drewe towarde them. But as soone as they were aduertysed of the kynges comynge / anone they submytted them to the kynges grace / oblygynge them selfe to make restytucyon accordynge to the kynges pleasure, to all suche places and persons as they hadde offended. And thys acte thus fynysshed / kyng Phylyppe returned vnto a place bytwene Uerdon, and the ile Audely / in the whyche place the kynge hadde appoynted a great counsayle or parlyament. where amonge other maters yt was concluded, that Iohn̄ kynge of Englande shulde be somoned to appere as the Frenche kynges

lyege man, at the same parlyament to be holden at parys wythin xv. dayes of Ester / to answere suffycyently to the kyng vppon such questyons as there shulde be purposed vnto hym, for the duchy of Normandye, for the coūtrey of Aungeou and of Poytyers. But for yt kynge John̄ came not at that day appoynted, nor none for hym accordynge to the monyshement to hym gyuen, therfore thys kynge Philypppe not withstandynge the amytye and trewce before confermed, assembled hys hoste and entred the duchye of Normandye, and made therin sharpe and cruell warre / and wanne a castell therein named Bonte or Bowte, and brused or crased the castellys of Gentylyne and Gurney / and seased all ye landes whyche Hugh de Gurney helde, and gyue theym vnto the duke of Brytayne. And also he gaue vnto hym the erledome of Aungeou, and two hundred knyghtes prysones of Normans and Englyshe wyth a great summe of money.
                     It was not longe after that the duke of Brytayne was departyd from the kynge / but that he wyth suche power as he myght make entred the countrey of Aungeou, to take therof possessyon. where in shorte space he was encountred of kynge John̄, and fought to geder a cruell batell. In the whyche in the ende the duke was put to the worse / for the more parte of hys people were slayne, and hym selfe wyth Hugh le Bruns, Godfrey de Lesygnan, and many other nobles of Fraunce and also of Brytayne, were taken prysoners. wyth whyche tydynges the Frenche kyng was greuously dyscontentyd. And where as at that tyme he had becleped ye castell of Arches wyth a strong syege / he remoued from thens and and yode to the citye of Towres and brent a part therof. But as testifyeth the frenche cronycle he taryed not the commynge of kynge Iohn̄. But for that wynter was commynge towarde / he ceasyd of hys warrys for that yere, and so drewe hym into Fraunce ⸫
                     In the yere folowynge, whyche was the yere of this Phylyp .xxiiii, &amp; of kynge Iohn̄ the .iiii. yere / ye warre newely began, whyche I ouer passe, for as mych as yt shall be shewyd in the storye of kynge Iohn̄.
                     In the .xxvi. yere thys Phylyppe Almaricus a studyent of Paris held certayne opynyons of heresye. Of the whyche when he was abiured / he toke suche thought that he dyed shortely after. It was not longe after but that other clerkys and studyauntys helde an other erronyous opynyon cōcernynge ye vnyon of the trynyte. Of the whyche nomber Peter byshoppe of Parys, and one Garyne a man of great connynge were two / the whyche were degraded, &amp; after cōsumyd wyth fyre / and the body of the forenamed Almaricus was agayne taken oute of the erthe, and after brent.
                     Nere about the .xxx. yere of the reygne of thys Phylyppe / for consyderacyon as sayth the frenche boke, that Iohn̄ kynge of Englande had exylyd dyuerse of hys byshoppes, and taken from them theyr possessyons and goodes / the whyche to this kynge Phylyp were comen for ayde and socour: he therfore mouyd with pytye, assembled a great hoste, and entendyd to haue sayled into Englande to haue refourmed these maters. wyth the whyche hoste he passed tyll he came to Grauenynge by lande, where he appoynted hys nauey to mete wyth hym. And to the

same place also Ferrande then erle of Flaundres had affermely promysyd to come, wyth the ayde of hys Flemynges / where the kynge for hym taryed a certayne of tyme. But shortely after the kynge was ascertayned that the sayde erle was alyed wyth kynge Iohn̄ hys enymye / and purposed to ayde hys partye in all that he myghte. wherof the occasyon was as affermeth the sayde Frenche cronycle, for so myche as Lewys eldest sonne of kynge Phylyppe helde from the sayde Farrande two castellys or townes named saynte Omer and Are.
                     when kynge Phylyppe apperceyued that he was thus of the erle dyspoynted / he by coūsayll of his Baronye putte by hys iourney into Englande, and assayled the countrey of Flaundres / and so yode vnto Cassyle a lytell from Grauelynge, &amp; wyth sharpe assaute wanne the sayd towne / and so from thens to Brugys / and commaunded hys nauy to be brought vnto the hauē of Sluse, whyche is wythin shorte waye of Brugys. And when he hadde executed hys pleasure at Brugys, leuyng a certayn of his peple for to strength hys Nauy / he yode vnto Gaunte, and there rested hym and hys people. In whyche season Regnolde erle of Boleyne, Guyllyam longe Espe, or Guyllyam wyth the longe sworde, wyth a crewe of Englyshe men aryued in Flaundres / to whom shortely drewe Ferraunde the erle wyth a great power of Flemynges. The whyche shypped theym in small caruyles and barkes and other shyppys of aduaūtage / and wyth a fyerse corage sette vppon the Frenche kynges nauey lyenge at Sluse as before is shewed / where was foughten a stronge and cruell batayll. But in the ende the Flemynges hadde the vyctorye, and hadde the rule of all the frenche flote, the whyche in nomber as testyfyeth the sayd frenche cronycle, were a thousande &amp; ten sayle. The whyche for nomber and greatnesse myghte not all lye wythin the hauyn / but spradde a great parte of the ryuer besyde. whyche so lyenge wythout the hauen, the Flemynges conueyed thens / and after layde ordinaunce to the towne of Sluse, and assyeged yt.
                     Kynge Phylyppe herynge of the losse of hys nauye, and of the assautynge of the towne of Sluse, in all haste spedde hym thyther / and there in suche wyse resysted hys enymyes, that he slew of them vpon two thousande / and toke of theym dyuerse prysoners, and rescued the towne. But for he sawe he myght not recouer hys shyppes beynge wythin the hauyn / he causyd theym to be dyscharged of vytell and other necessaryes, and after set them on fyre and the towne also / and that done, toke certayne hostages of Brugis of Gaunte and of Ipre, and so retourned into Fraunce.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXLV. CHAPITER.
                     
                        WHen kynge Phylippe was returned into Fraunce / yt was not longe after, that by the meanes of some well dysposyd persones, he was reconcyled and toke to hym his lawfull wyfe Ingeberta or Ingebert,

doughter of the kynge of Denmarke / whyche was great comforte to all hys people. And thys yt nowe apperyth that the sayde Ingebert was from her lorde or husbande by the terme of .xvi. yeres and more, as before yt is touched in the seconde chapyter of thys storye.
                     In the yere of grace .xii. hūdred .xiiii. as sayth the frenche boke, whyche maketh the yere of the reygne of this Philyppe .xxxv / Otho the .iiii. of that name and duke of Saxony, whyche of some of the electours was chosen for emperour / in the quarell of kyng Iohn̄ intred ye prouince of Henaude, and there beynge accompanyed with Reygnolde erle of Boleyne, Farraunde erle of Flaundres, and dyuerse other nobles, as well of Englande, Saxonye, and other places / made prouysyon to fyght wyth kynge Phylyppe, whyche then warred in Flaūdres / so that the Frenche kynge was at the castell of Peron, and Otho was at the castell of Ualensyens or Ualenseus.
                     About Mary Madgdaleyns tyde, the Frenche kynge in wastyng ye coū
                        trey of Flaūdres came vnto the town of Turney / and Otho returned from the foresayde castell, and came vnto the castell or towne named Mortenge, the whyche was but .vi. myle from Turney. wherof herynge the kynge, entendyd to haue set in shorte tyme vppon hys enymyes. But by the aduyse of hys barons he was letted / for so myche as the wayes and places were streyghte and narowe towarde hys enymyes. For the whyche consyderacyon by counsayll of hys sayde barones he was letted, and retourned towarde Henawde for to haue more larger playnes. So that after saynte Iamys daye he retourned / purposynge that nyghte to haue lyen and also his hoste at the castell called Lylly. But he was letted of hys purpose. For Otho whych was warned of hys remouynge, demed hym to haue fled and pursued after the vaungarde of the kynge / of the whyche were captaynes the vycounte of Mylyon, and one named Fryer Garnye / the whyche was a a fryer and relygyous man, a man of great counsayll and hardynesse. These beynge accompanyed wyth iiii. thounsande men / rode tyll they came to an hyll or lytle Mountayne, where they espyed the auauntage of Otho and hys hoste. wherfore fryer Garny retourned to gyue the kynge knowlege / and the vycounte remayned in the place, and houed with his companye.
                     when the kynge hadde knowlege of the commynge of his enymyes / he in good maner kepte on hys iourney. In whyche season Otho, wyth hys people came vnto ye ryuer which was somdeale daungerous to passe / howe be yt in processe he passed yt. And when he &amp; his hoste were ouer / he made waye towarde Turney / in so myche that the Uycounte &amp; his cō
                        pany demed them to haue retourned to Turney. But so soone as Fryer Garny was returned vnto the sayde mount, anon he demed the coūtrary / &amp; sayd precysely that other they must gyue batayll to theyr enimyes, or ellys they must fle wyth shame. In thys whyle the kynges people came vnto a brydge where they shulde passe ouer. And the cautele of hys enymyes was, that when the kynge wyth the more parte of hys people hadde ben passed that brydge / they wolde haue sette vppon the rerewarde, and haue dystressyd theym / and so haue kepte that brydge that the kynge shulde not haue socoured

his people. But or the kynge were passed the fyght was begonne / in so myche that hydeous crye came to the kynges crys, at armys at armys, to harneys to harnes, our enymyes be come.
                     Nere vnto the kyng was a chapell halowed in the honour and worshyp of saynte Peter / wherunto the kyng yode and made there hys deuoute prayers / and that done armed hym, and lepte to horse ioyously cryenge / as barons at armys. Then the Oryflambe which was passed ye brydge, was countermaunded. And then began the trumpettys and tabours to blowe / whyche reuyued the palled hartes, and caused theym to forgete the drede of deth. But for the kynges people myght not so hastely retourne and passe the brydge / the kynge as a valyaunt knyghte toke hys horse wyth hys spurrys, and set forwarde to encourage the other of hys knyghtes / so that his enymyes herynge of hys commynge, were somdeale dyscoraged and gaue place vnto the kynges hoste. Then Otho herynge of the kynges retourne, enbatayled hys people. But so yt was that he toke the northe parte of the felde / by reason wherof the sonne was in hys face to hys afterdeale / for that was excedynge hote ouer the other. Then was the batell begonne in dyuers partyes of the felde so cruelly that many a mā was there ouerthrowen. The whyche endured be a longe space, in suche wyse that harde yt was to dyscerne whyche partye hadde the better of that other. Eyther prynce enforcyd so straytely that other / that eyther of theym were vnhorsed and in great ieoperdye. If here I shulde reherse the vyctoryouse dedys of the Frenche kynge and hys knyghtes in order, after the expressement of the frenche boke / I shulde therof make a longe storye. But trouth yt is that in the ende / Otho was compelled to forsake the felde, to the great losse of hys people / and Feraunte the erle of Flaunders was taken wyth many other, as Reygnolde erle of Boleyn, and .xxviii. other of name.
                     And one thynge hardely me semeth to be credence gyuen vnto, rehersyd by the frenche cronycle, whych sayth that of all the frenche hoste myssed but one syngle man / the whyche after was founde amonge the dede Almaynes sore wounded, and after cured and helyd agayne. whyche maye be tolde for a great wonder / consyderynge the sayde fyghte lasted ouer foure howres, as testyfyeth the sayd cronycle. But sure the authoure or the wryter ouerseeth hym selfe in that reporte / for he shewyth before in the dyuysynge of the fyghte of thys batell, that when kynge Phylyppe was felled from hys horse, two of hys knyghtes were slayne ryghte before hym / that one named Guyllyam de longe Champe, and that other Gerarde le Tirne. But maister Robert Gagwyne expressyth thys more clerely / sayenge that after the felde was done and the emperoure was fledde, leuynge hys banner of splayed Egle behynde hym / a bysshement of the nomber of .vii. hundred men recoueryd that standarde, and so kepte theym to gyther. wherof when the kynge was enfourmed / he sente agayne them one of hys knyghtes called syr Thomas Ualary, accōpanyed wyth .l. fotemen &amp; two thousand horse men. The whych dystressyd ye sayd cōpany, wythout losse of one man as before is sayde. And more ouer the sayd authour sayth / yt vppon the partye of the sayde Otho

of knyghtes and gylte harnesse were slayne a thousande &amp; fyue hundred / and of other horse men and fote men a hundred and fyfty thousande. But of ye Frenche men whych shulde be sureste of rekenynge / he maketh no mencyon. But trouth it is, that in all the cronycle thoroughe the Frenche boke rehersed / all thynge touchynge theyr honour is declared and shewed to the vttermoste. And that whyche concerneth theyr dyshonoure or losse, yt ys ouer subtely excused / or so darkely or mystly wryten, that the reader therof shall hardely come to the knowlege of the trouthe. And that is well apparent in the storyes of Phylyppe de Ualoys and of kynge John̄ hys sonne, in expressement of theyr faytes done and exercysed agayne the thyrde Edwarde kyng of England and prynce Edwarde hys sonne.
                     Than it foloweth in ye story / whan Phylyp hadde obteyned this greate vyctory of hys enemyes, and ordered other thynges concernynge hys people, as countermaūdynge them the next waye vnto theyr countrees / he wyth hys prysoners spedde hym to Parys / and there of hys greate bounte graunted to the sayde erlys of Boleyne and Flaunders theyr lyues, but not of prysonement. For the erle of Boleyne was sent vnto the castell of Peron / and Feraunt erle of Flaunders was commytted to the castell or towre of Louour wythout the wallys of the cytye of Parys thā newly made. But wythin lesse than xv. monethes after / by labour of his wyfe, he with other of hys lyege men was delyuered / payenge theyr fynaunces, and perfourmyng of other streyght condycyons.
                  
                  
                     THE .CCXLVI. CHAPITER.
                     
                        IT was not longe after that kynge Phylyppe reassembled hys knyghtes, and spedde hym towarde the countrey of Poytow. wherof beynge warned the erle of Thoners that than was chefe ruler of that countrey vnder kyng Iohn̄, seynge the feblenesse of the comons that dayly were vexed wyth warre, and also the losse of kynge John̄s frendes, not wythstandyng the sayd Iohn̄ was than wythin twenty myles / yet he made suche meanes to kynge Phylyppe by the laboure of Peter than duke or erle of Brytayn, that the sayde kynge accepted the same erle to hys grace / and graunted to hym and hys a trewce for .iiii. yeres. But that not wythstandyng / the kynge kept on hys iourney towarde kynge Iohn̄. wherof kynge Iohn̄ beynge enfourmed / and also of the peace bytwene the erle of Thoners and the Frenche kynge: he by meanes of one Roberte a legate of Rome sought meanes of treaty and of peace / so that in processe by dylygence of the sayde Robert and other, a peace was concluded for .v. yeres. whyche peace concluded and assured eyther kynge returned into theyr owne prouynces.
                     wythin short whyle after ye Frenche kyng was returned into Fraūce / he called to mynde the great vyctory had of the Almayns / wyth also one other whych Lewys his son about ye same tyme had agayne or of kynge Iohn̄ in the countre of Aungeou, at the castell of Moyne or Mayne. For the whyche .ii. vyctoryes, the kynge edyfyed a monastery besyde the cyty of Sayntles, in the honour of saynt Uyctor / and endowed it wyth fayre and ryche possessyons, and named it the abbey of saynt Uyctor.
                     
                        In the .xxxvi. yere of the reygne of thys Phylyppe / Lewys hys sonne by procurynge and sturrynge of the lordes of Englande, sayled into the sayde prouynces / as more playnely shall be shewed in the .xvi. yere of the reygne of kynge Iohn̄.
                     Many mo storyes &amp; actes myght I brynge in and set in thys story of thys kynge Phylyppe, yf I shulde folowe the Frenche boke. For he maketh there a rehersayll that conteyneth .xxxix. greate leuys of parchemyne. Of the whyche I haue taken out suche as to me semeth moste conuenyent / and haue ouer passed the other for lengthe of the tyme.
                     Than it foloweth / thys Phylyp after these dayes drewe hym to more quyet and reste / so that after thys peace or trewce cōcluded wyth kyng Iohn̄ of Englande, the authour speketh not or myndeth of any noble dede by hym done. So that in the yere of our lorde .xii. hundred and .xxii, whyche shulde be the yere of hys reygne .xliii / the sayd authour begynneth, and sayth that in that foresayd yere apered a greate eclypce of the son, wherof the lyke hadde not ben seen in many yeres passed.
                     And in the yere folowynge dyed thys Phylyppe in the moneth of Iunii, whan he hadde reygned vppon xliiii. yeres. Before whose deth apered a great comete or blasyng starre / the whyche the Frenche men, wyth also the foresayde eclypce / they adiudged for pronostiquys and tokens of the kynges deth / the whyche was buryed wyth excellent pompe in the monastery of saynt Denys, in the yere of our lorde a thousand two hundred and .xxiii. and of hys age .lviii / leuynge after hym the fore named Lewys / whyche was enoynted kyng after hym.
                     Thys Phylyppe amonges other notable thynges ordeyned in hys testament / be sette to the aydynge and wynnynge of the holy cytye of Hierusalem thre hundred thousande pownde of Parys money / to the hospytall in Mount forte a hundred thousande pownde / and to be dystrybuted amonges the poore comons of hys londe he gaue twenty thousande pownde.
                     But here is to be noted, there is a great dyuersyte bytwene a pownd of Parys money and a pownde of sterlynge money. For a pownde of Parys money is but two shyllynges and .vi. pence sterlynge, or nere there about. And so it foloweth that a thousande pownde of Parys, is but a hundred fyue and twenty pownde sterlynge. By whyche accompte it foloweth that thys kynge gaue to the ayde of the holy londe .xxxvii. thousande and fyue hundred pownde sterlynge / to the hospytall xii. thousande and fyue hundred pownde sterlynge / and to the poore people two thousand &amp; fyue hundred pownde.

Port is to meane a town, and greue is ment for a gardyen or ruler / as who wolde meane, gardeyn, ruler, or keper of the town. These of olde tyme, wyth the lawes and customys then vsyd within thys cytye / were regystred in a boke called the Domysday in Saxon tunge then vsed. But in later dayes when the sayde lawes and customes alteryd and chaunged, and for consyderacyon also that the sayde boke was of small hande and sore defacyd, yt was the lesse set by, so that yt was enbefelyd or loste / so that the remembraunce of suche rulers as were before the dayes of thys Rycharde the fyrst, whose story shall next ensue, are loste and forgoten.
                  wherfore nowe I shall begynne at the fyrste yere of the sayde fyrste Rycharde, the whyche of some wryters is surnamed Cure de Lyon / and so contynew the names of all offycers, as well baylyuys, mayres, and shryues, tyll the laste yeres of Rycharde the thyrde kynge in dede and not of ryght. whyche baylyues I shall appoynt the rule of, from Mychelmas to Mychelmas / and the mayres frō suche tyme and season as nowe ys accustomyd &amp; vsed, that is to saye from the daye of Symon and Iude vnto the same feste nexte ensuynge / vpon whyche daye the newe mayre taketh hys charge at the Guylde hall, and the olde mayre is there and then dyscharged of the sayde offyce of mayraltye.

                        RIcharde the fyrst of that name, and seconde sonne of Henry the second / beganne hys reygne ouer Englād in the moneth of Iuly, and yere of our lorde .x. hundred .lxxx. and .x / and the .xi. yere of the seconde Phylyppe then kynge of Fraunce.
                     Thys Rycharde prouyded besely to sette good rule in Normādy, when he hadde harde of hys fathers deth, and after spedde him into England / where he was ioyously receyued / &amp; in the moneth of September folowynge and thyrde daye, he was crowned at westmynster of Baldwyn archbyshoppe of Caunterburye. Uppon the whyche daye the Iewys of Englande, and specyally suche as dwellyd within London and nere about / assembled of them a certayn nomber, and presumyd farther then requyred for theyr authoryte. For whyche presumpcyon they were fyrste rebuked, &amp; after one of thē strykē. which thyng sene of the cōmon people, supposyd that to be done by the kynges commaundement. wherfore in a fury as those that they hated as the deuyll for theyr vsury &amp; other vnhappy condycyons, they fell vppon theym, and chased them to theyr houses, &amp; them robbed and spoyled wythout pytye, and brent some of theyr housis / wher of the rumour ranne to westmynster to ye kynges audyēce. wherfore in all haste he sent downe / gyuyng strayte cōmaundement that they shuld cease of that ryot. But the people were in suche ire and wodenesse, that they refrayned not for all the kinges sonde, tyll they hadde executed the fyne of theyr malyce. And all be yt that thys ryot was after greuously shewyd agayne the commons of the cytye / yet yt passed vnpunyshed, for the great nomber of the transgressours.
                     And the sayde daye of coronacyon / all prysoners that lay in any pryson aboute London at the kynges sute, or for other small or fayned accyons, were frely delyueryd.
                     Soone after the kynge gaue many dygnytyes / and to hys brother Iohn̄ he gaue the prouynces of Notyngham, Deuonshyre, and Cornewall / and creatyd hym erle of Lancaster. And then the kynge ordeyned the cytye of London to be ruled by two baylyues whose names were as foloweth.

                     IT was not longe after that ye the kynge hadde thus exalted hys brother Iohn̄ as before is shewwyd / but that he also preferryd hym to the maryage of the erle of Glouceters doughter / by reason wherof he

was lorde of that erledome. These great auaūcementis made him after vnkynde to his broder / and by pryde therof to coueyt afterwarde the hole kyngdome.
                     Thys yere kynge Rycharde was assoyled of the offence that he had vsyd in rebellyon agayne hys father. In recompēsacyon wherof as testyfyeth the authour Guydo / he voluntaryly toke vppon hym and promysed to warre vppon Crystes enymyes. All be yt that other wryters shewe, that yt was for that that hys father had so wylled hym by hys lyfe. But for what cause, so yt was, preparacyon and prouysyon for that iourney was made from that daye forthwarde.
                     Thys yere also the kynge enlarged Elyanoure hys moder / whyche long before at the commaundement of his father her husbande, was as a prysoner kepte in secrete kepynge. After whych enlargyng, ye land was mych guydyd by her counsayll. And thys yere, as sayth Ranulfe / kynge Rycharde gaue ouer the castellis of Barwyke and Rochysburghe to ye Scottyshe kyng, for the summe of .x. thousande pounde, for the exployte of his voyage. And farther more he sold to the olde byshoppe of Durham hys owne prouynce for a great summe of money, and creatyd hym erle of the same. wherfore the kynge sayde after in game, I am a wonders crafty man / for I haue made a new erle of an old byshop. By suche meanes the kyng emptyed many byshoppes and ryche prestys bagges and fylled hys cofers. And ouer that he graunted oute annuytyes and fees oute of the crowne, as though he roughte nothynge of hys retournynge. For this dede some of hys famylyers as they durste blamed hym. But he sayde to thē yt in tyme of nede, it was good polycy for a man to ayde hym wyth his owne. And more ouer he ioyned ther to, that yf London were hys / at that tyme of nede he wolde sell yt, yf he myght gete a conuenyent marchaūt that for yt were able to paye.
                     An other waye he hadde also to gather money / for he hadde lycence of pope Innocent the thyrd of that name, to dyspence wyth suche as hym lyked wythin his realme for takyng vppon theym the crosse.

                     IN the seconde yere in the moneth of October / kynge Rycharde betoke the guydynge of the lande vnto the byshoppe of Ely then chaunceller of Englande, and sayled into Normandye / where settynge the coūtrey vnder sadde guydyng, shortly after mette with the Frenche kyng Phylyp the second / the whych ioyntly yode to Turon, and there ouer passyd the shortnesse of wynter. In whyche passe tyme makynge eyther wyth other assuraunce for contynuaunce of so great a iourney / at the sprynge of ye yere these two princes toke theyr voyage towarde the holy lande / that is to meane kyng Rycharde by ye see, and knnge Phylyppe by the lande / and appoynted to mete agayn in the land of Scicilia or Scycyll. In this meane tyme, in England the Iewes in dyuers places of ye realme, as Lyncolne, Staunforde, and Lynne were robbed and spoyled / and at yorke, to

the nomber of foure hundred &amp; mo, cutte theyr mayster veynes and bled to deth.
                     The two kynges accordynge to theyr appoyntemēt met in Scycyll / where grudge beganne to kyndle betwene theym for correccyon of theyr souldyours. Then the French kyng departyd agayne from kynge Rycharde / the whyche there made certayne ordynaunces for warre, as a towre or castell of tymber whyche he named Mategryffons / and also prouyded for vytayll for both hostes.
                     In thys tyme also the kynge of Cyprys hadde taken two shyppes of kynge Rycharde, and denyed the delyuery of theym. wherfore the sayde Rycharde entryd the land of Cypris makynge therin sharpe warre / &amp; chasyd so the kynge from cytye to cytye, that lastely he yelded him vnto kyng Rycharde, vppon condicyon that he shulde not be throwen in bondes of iron / wherof kynge Rycharde in kepynge of hys promyse caste hym in bondes of syluer.
                     when kynge Rycharde hadde dwellyd there vppon two monethes, and hadde taken his pleasure of that coū
                        trey, and taken amendes at his own wyll for hys shyppes / then he departed from the sayde yle of Cypris, and sayled towarde Acon or Acris. In whyche course so kepynge towarde Acris / he encountred a great shyppe of the Soudans of Sury, fraughte wyth great ryches, and toke yt / and so came at length to ye cytye of Acris, where at that tyme lay before ye sayd towne the Frenche kynge wyth hys hoste / and had lost a lytle before two thousande of hys men, whyche were partyd from hys hoste to haue done an enterpryse vppon the Turkes / but they were layde for &amp; dystressed.
                     Then as testyfyeth Peter Dysroy, kynge Rycharde was ioyously receyued of the Frenche kynge. After whose commynge yt was not longe that the sayd cytye was gyuen vp by appoyntement as foloweth, and as affermeth the sayde Peter, and also the cronycle of Fraunce. Fyrste that the Sarasyns shulde departe out of the cytye / leuynge behynde theym horse, harneys, vytayll, and all other thynge belongynge to warre. Also they shulde cause to be restoryd all such prysoners of crystē men as they had vnder theyr kepyng, wyth other couenauntes whyche I passe ouer. And thus was the cytye of Acris yelden into the crysten mennes handes, in the moneth of Auguste, &amp; the yere of our lorde .xi. hundred .lxxx. and, xii. But when yt came to the partyng of the praye of the cytye / there beganne malyce to kyndle hys bronde, whych was not lyghtly after quenchyd.
                     Of thys varyance betwene these two kynges of England &amp; of Fraūce dyuers maners are shewyd. For Polycronica sayth that yt beganne by reason that kynge Rycharde denyed vnto kynge Phylyp halfe hys wynnynges in Cypris, accordyng to the couenauntis betwene theym assured at Turon. But kyng Rychard sayd that the cōuencyon there made / stretched no forther then to suche goodes as was wonne wythin the lymytes or boundes of the holy lande. Another grudge was, by reason that the French kyng ayded not ye erle of Champeyne beynge in dystresse of nede. wherfore the sayde erle beynge discontent sayde to the Frēche kyng. Syr hytherto I haue done accordynge to my dutye / but hereafter I shall do as I am compellyd be nede. For your grace hath hytherto cherysshed me but for myn / but now I shal go to hym yt is more redy to gyue thē to take / and so departed to kyng Rycharde, of the whyche he had all hys

pleasure. The thyrde cause was as sayth Ranulph, for as mych as kyng Rycharde at hys begynnyng in Scycyll maryed the syster of the kynge of Nauerne / where before he hadde promysed to mary the syster of the sayde kynge Phylyppe. But of these artycles speketh nothyng the french cronycle / all be it he layeth greate defaute vnto kynge Rycharde / sayeng in sedycyous and vyle wordys, that kyng Rycharde falsly brake hys appoyntmentes, and kepte no promesse that by hym was made. Moreouer the sayd cronycle sayth that he solde the ile of Cyprys vnto the Templers for .xxx. thousande marke / and after toke it agayne frō them by strength, and delyuered it vnto Guy de Lesygnan that was the laste crystened kynge of Hierusalem. And ouer this the sayde frenche cronycle sayth, that he toke from a knyght of the duke of Ostrych the sayd dukes banner / and in despyte of the sayde duke trade it vnderfote, and dyd vnto it all the despyte he myghte. And ouer all thys, where as Conradus Markes of Tyre was traytorously slayn by two of his owne seruauntes / that kyng Rycharde shulde laye the charge therof vnto the frenche kynge.
                     For these grudges and sykenesse, wyth also fere of treason to be wrought bytwene Saladyne the Soudā, and kynge Rycharde as affermeth or allegeth the foresayde authoure / kynge Phylyppe wyth a small company of shyppes departed from Acō or Acris, &amp; sayled to Puyll or Poyll / and there restynge hym a season, cō
                        tynued hys iourney vnto Rome, and so lastely into hys owne prouynce of Fraunce.

                     IN the thyrde yere and moneth of Nouember, when the Frenche kynge was thus departed / kyng Rychard with the duke of Burgoyn whom the French kynge hadde lefte behynde hym to haue the rule of the Frenche hoste lafte and remaynyng in Acre and the countre there about, called before hym dyuers persons or pledges of Turkes, for the perfourmaunce of certayne appoyntementes taken wyth them at ye wynnynge or gyuynge vp of the sayde cytye of Acris. wherof one especiall couenaūt was, that by a certayne daye than expyred, they shulde cause ye holy crosse to be restored vnto the crysten prynces. The whyche for he saw well that they wolde not or myghte not perfourme / he therfore put in execucyon of Turkes ouer the noumber of .v. thousande as testyfyeth the Frenche cronycle. But that agreed not all of the beste wyth the former sayeng / cō
                        syderynge the cytye was delyuered by appoyntement, there shulde not so many Turkes remayne there. But Peter Dysroye sayth, that for brekynge of thys appoyntement, kynge Rycharde put to deth all suche Turkes as were than wythin the cytye of Acris / whyche maye be ment by the hostages or pledges.
                     It was not longe after that tydynges were brought vnto kyng Rycharde, that the cytye of Hierusalem was wythout any greate strength of Soldyours, and that it myghte be wonne wyth easy labour. wherfore kyng Rychard assembled the lordes

to haue theyr coūsayll / where it was cōcluded that euery capyteyne shuld prepare hym to go thyther. Uppon whyche agrement, the crysten hoste sped them in such wyse, yt they were within .v. myles of ye sayd city of Hierusalem / where they toke a new coū
                        sayll how they shuld order them and theyr people to lay theyr syege about the cytye. In whyche coūsayll it was concluded, yt kynge Rycharde wyth hys Englyshe men shulde haue the vawewarde / and the duke of Burgoyne the rere warde. After whyche conclusyon taken / the kynge spedde hym vppon his waye towarde the cytye. But by what myshappe or mysfortune I can not saye / so soone as the kynge was departed, the duke called the lordes of Fraunce before hym / and sayde, yt is euydent vnto you, that all be yt our hedde and souerayne lorde is absent, the floure of the chyualry of Fraūce is present. And yf any thyng be done to the honour of the Crysten, and reproche of infydels / yt is most lykely to be done by vs, consyderyng yt insuffycyencye of Englyshemen and other. yet neuerthelesse, what someuer honoure grow by our dedis to ye cristen hoste / yt shall be accompted vnto kyng Rycharde because of hys presence / so yt we shall haue all the payne and trauayll, and Englyshemen shall haue the honour. wherfore if ye wyll do by my counsayll / we wyll returne vnto Acrys, and there tarye tyll we se farther. Some agreed to this counsayll and the more in nomber / &amp; the other spedde them in all haste after kynge Rycharde, and shewed to hym of the dukes returne / wherof he beynge so enfourmed returned also vnto Acris.
                     It was not longe after that the sayd duke was taken wyth greuous sykenesse and dyed. And about that tyme also dyed Baldewyn archbysshoppe of Caunterburye / whyche amonge other lordes of Englande, accompanyed the kynge in that iourney.

                     ABout the season of Mychelmasse, in ye .iiii. yere of the reygne of thys sayde Rycharde / tydynges were brought to hym yt the town or castell of Iapheth was besyeged of Salādyne / and lykely to be soone wonne, wythout the crysten were the sooner ayded. wherfore kynge Rycharde, whych Peter Dysroy calleth the good kynge Rycharde / sped hym thyther with his army by water, and sent a nother hoste of Frēchemen and other by lande. But so yt was or the cristen myght wynne thyther / y• sayd towne and castell were wonne / and the prysoners therin taken, were sent by water towarde such prysones as Salandyne hadde appoynted them vnto. wyth the whyche of good fortune kynge Rycharde mette, &amp; them rescowyd. And that done, wyth the Turkes whyche theym conueyed he put in sure holde / and helde on hys iourney to Iapheth / and there by strength rescuyd the towne &amp; castell, ond restoryd the crysten to theyr former possessyon, and left wyth theym more strength of knyghtes. And for to be the more feryd of the myscreaū
                        tes / kynge Rycharde caused hys prysoners to hym belongynge to be slayne, where other solde theym to

theyr great auaūtage / by mean wher of he was hadde in wonderfull fere of the Turkes.
                     Then kynge Rycharde after thys victory hadde at Iapheth / wonne .ii. strong holdes callyd Daron and Gadres, and strengthyd them wyth crysten knyghtes. And wyth such goodes as he there wāne of the Turkes, he repayred the castel of Ascalon and other, that greatly was impayred by the warre of the Turkes.
                     In thys season and tyme ye kyng Rycharde was thus occupyed in the holy lande / the byshoppe of Ely as before is sayde hauynge the rule of Englande, dyd many cruell dedys / and oppressyd the clergy and also the lay fee. He wolde cōmenly ryde with a thousande horse / and greued abbeys by meane of hys gestys or lodgynge wyth theym. Also he helde in hys handes the see of yorke for longe season. And after ye deth of Balwyne dede as before is shewed in the holy land / he also toke the see of Caunterbury vnder hys rule. Then he pryued Geffrey that was chosen to the 
                           •
                        ee of yorke of hys mouables / &amp; caste him as prisoner in ye towre of Lōdon. And soon after called a counsayll at westmynster as the kynges procuratour, and as legate of the pope then Innocent the .iii. At thys counsayll Hughe Nouaunt then byshoppe of Chester, &amp; great famylyer of the sayd byshoppe of Ely / putte forth a complaynt agayne ye munkes of Couentre, that they hadde shed the sayde Hughys blood before the hygh aulter of theyr chyrche. For whych cause the byshoppe of Ely demyd, that the sayde munkys shulde be putte from theyr sayde abbey, &amp; clerkes shuld be set there for thē / so that by myght the munkes were put thens and dysperbled about in sondry placis, and clerkes wyth prebendys set in theyr stallys. For thys dede sayth Guydo and other, that thys Hugh byshoppe of Chester hadde thus causyd the munkes of Couentre to lose theyr lande and house / he toke therfore so great repentaunce, that vppon hys deth bed he axed of god that for a due and conuenyent penaunce, he myght redeme that offence by the lyeng in the fyre of purgatory from ye daye of his deth vnto the generall day of dome.
                     Also the forenamed byshoppe of Ely called in proper name wyllyam de longe shampe / contynuynge hys tyrannyes, pryuyd Hugh byshoppe of Durham of all maner worshippe / and greued the byshoppe of wynchester, and wretched nygh all the lande. But so faste as thys innaturall or euyll dysposyd man besyed hym to vex and greue the crysten men in England / so fast besyed this good kyng Rycharde to vexe &amp; dere the infydels of Sury. So yt dayly he wanne of theym / or at the leste putte theym from the wynnynge of suche townes and holdes, as they by theyr great strength entendyd to haue wonne.

                     Then Hubert byshop of Salysbury yode forth hym selfe from ye kyng to the holy citye / and offeryd there an hoste, and retourned agayne to the kynge. After whose returne, ye kynge takynge leue of the erle of Champayne and other / toke his shyppyng at Acrys or Acon, whyche ys named Tholomayda also / and so returned to the yle of Cypre or Cyprys.
                     Thens the kynge sent the quene hys wyfe and her syster wyth ye more parte of hys people vnto Scycyll / and he wyth a small company for he myghte not endure the softenesse of the see, toke his shyppynge in the moneth of September, and sayled wyth a stronge wynde towarde a coūtrey callyd Histria. But he was dryuen by force of wederynge betwene Uenyse and Aquinilia or Aquilegia, and houyd there a season, and costed hyther and thyther / so that lastely he was espyed and taken of the duke of Ostrychys men.

                     ABout the moneth of October &amp; .vi. yere of hys reygne / thys good kynge Rycharde was taken in fourme folowynge. As he lay thus as before is sayde, betwene Uenyce and Aquilegia a ꝓuynce of the duke of Ostrych / one Meynart of Gorezeyn ruler of that countrey vnder the foresayde duke, made out certayne souldyours for to haue taken hym. But he by hys prouydence and manhode escapyd ye sayd Maynarde or Maynart / how be yt that some of hys knyghtes were there takyn. Then kynge Rycharde passed ye coū
                        trey secretly, tyll he came to a towne named Frysake. In thys towne was then prouoste or ruler a knyght called Frederyk de saynt Soom / ye whyche also dyd hys deuoure to take the kynge, and toke .vi. of his knyghtes prysoners / but hym selfe wyth the remenaunt of hys company escaped. Then the kynge seynge that he was in daunger of hys enymyes / drewe more into the way towarde Almayn. But thys was soone knowen of hys enymyes / so that by the meanes of one called Duke of Lymple and cosyn to the emperoure / all the wayes were closyd in suche wyse, that in the ende kynge Rycharde was taken by the seruauntes of the sayd duke, nere vnto a citye or towne called Menne or Meune, wythin the lande or terrytory of the emperoure / and after brought vnto the sayde duke Lymple, or after some to the duke of Ostriche / ye which spoyled hym of all yt he hadde, and after caste hym in prison,

and there streyghtely kepte hym by the space of a moneth / and at the monethes ende sente hym vnto Henry the .vi. of that name, or after some wryters the .v. sonne of the fyrst Frederyke then emperour of Almayne / the whyche helde hym in more vyle pryson from that tyme tyll lent after and couenauntyd wyth the duke of Ostryche to haue the thyrde parte of the profyte that came of kynge Rycharde. About the sonday of Palmys the emperour brought forth the kynge before the lordes of Almayne, there to gyue answere vnto suche thynges as shuld be layde vnto hym. where he came forth wyth so good a coūtenaunce, &amp; also answered so dyscretely and dyrectely to all maters layde vnto hys charge / that the emperoure was not alonely bende to shewe to hym mercy, but also he dyd to hym honour and worshyppe / and helde hym at more libertye after that daye.
                     It is redde of thys Rycharde, that durynge the tyme of hys imprysonement he shuld sle a lyon, and tere the harte oute of hys bodye, where thorough he shulde deserue the name of Rycharde Cure de Lyon / and yt he shuld wyth a stroke of his fyst sle the emperours sonne, and also deflorysh the emperours doughter. But these are fablys ymagined by englysh tale tellers, to auaunce theyr kynge Rycharde / as the Brytons by theyr fayned talys auaunced theyr kynge Arture. In this passetyme wyllyam Longeshamp byshop of Ely, contynuynge his crudelyte and tyrannye wythin Englande / was lastely by strength of the lordes put oute of the lande. Then he came to the kynge beynge prysoner, &amp; shewyd for hym self the beste he coude. But when he saw he myght not begyle the kynge wyth his sugryd wordes, he hadde small truste of the kynges fauour / &amp; returned into Fraunce, to tarye there the kynges commynge.
                     Thys yere Iohn̄ the kynges brother by excityng of the French kyng, when he harde of the takyng and imprisonynge of hys brother / began to make warre within ye lande / &amp; toke by strength ye castelles of wyndesour and of Notyngham &amp; other. And the frenche kyng vpon his partye made strong warre in Normādy, as it is before shewed in the story of the second Phylyppe than kynge of Fraunce.

                     IN the .vii. yere of kynge Rycharde / Hubert byshoppe of Salysbury, the whych hadde accompanyed the kynge in that voyage, and was sente wyth the quene into Scycyll, retourned or came to the kyng where he was prysoner. whom the kynge sente soone after into Englande, to haue the guydynge therof, and also to treate wyth the lordes and commons of hys realme, howe he myghte be sette at lybertye.
                     It was not long after the cōmyng home of this Hubert, but the mūkes of the house of Cristes chyrch of Caū
                        terburye chase hym to the archebysshoppes see / and hadde the palle, and was stallyd soone after. This was easy to the mūkes / how well ye sharpnes of Baldwyne had somdeale greued theym. And though thys Baldwyne were a good man &amp; holy in his

lyuynge / yet one thyng he dyd to the derogacyon of the munkes of Caunterburye / for he purposyd to put the prerogatiue of the eleccyon of the archbishoppe from the munkes. And because therof, he beganne to buylde great houses nere vnto the munkes chyrche, by fauour of the kynge Henry the seconde (but not wythout shedynge of blood) and there entendyd to haue set in secular chanons with prebendys and suffraganes of bysshoppes for to treate wyth the sayde chanons of the foresayde eleccyon, &amp; to put by the mūkes clerely. But the munkes when they sawe they myght no lenger resyst Baldwyn, they then appealed to the pope Innocent the thyrde / by whose cōmaundemēt that worke ceasyd, and so stode vnfynysshed tyll the sayde Baldwyne was dede. After whose deth the munkes made that worke playne wyth the grounde. Treuisa translatoure of Policronycon, sayth yt was wonder that Baldwyn wolde in that maner deale wyth the munkes / consyderyng he was fyrst archdeacon, &amp; then white munke, and then abbot, &amp; after byshop of worceter, and last archbysshoppe / &amp; to brynge men of more imperfyte lyfe, into ye place of men more perfyte, &amp; to chaunge religyous men for seculer men. But yet the sayde Treuisa allowyth Baldwynes dede or entent for good. For he sayth that Criste was the hedde of holy chyrch, and callid and made his apostles bysshoppes / but none of them was munke or yet frere. wherfore Baldwyne dyd better to preferre the relygyon whyche Cryste made, then the relygyon whyche was instytuted and ordeyned by man.

                     IN in the moneth of Ianuary, and .viii. yere of the reygne of kynge Rycharde, when the sayde Rycharde had sufferyd harde prysonement vppon the terme of a yere and thre monethes / he was deliuered out of Pryson for the summe of an hundred thousande pounde of sterlynge money.
                     For pledge wherof he lefte in the kepynge of the emperoure the bysshoppes of Roan and of Bathe. But not for all / for a great parte was payed or the kynge were delyueryd.Ornamē
                           tes of the chyrche folde. For payment of whyche raunsom all the wolle of whyte munkes &amp; chanons was taken and solde, &amp; rynges and crosses of prelates, wyth vessels and chalyces of all chyrches thorough ye land / &amp; ouer that .xxvii. shrynes were scraped or spoylyd of ye gold &amp; syluer that vppon theym before tyme was layd / for no pryuylege of holy chyrch nor other persone at that season was sparyd. Then kynge Rycharde came vnto Swyne in Flaūdres, and taryed there two monethes / other to abyde the wynde, or ellys to make prouysyon for thynges whych he neded. There the emperours men had almost taken him agayn. So the emperour forthought ye deliuery of king Rychard, as Pharao forthought the delyuery of the chyldren of Israel.
                     Then the kyng toke shippyng, and lāded in ye ende of Marche at Sandwyche / &amp; from thens came streyghte vnto Lōdon, where he was receyued wyth all ioye and honour. And when he had a season rested hym there / he wyth a certayn nomber of knyghtes rode to Nothyngam, &amp; wan ye castell

and after the castell of Tykhyll by force of armes, and set the wardeyns of theym in warde. And that done he called a counsayll of hys lordes at wynchester / where by authoryte of the sayd coūsayll, he depryued Iohn̄ hys brother then beynge in Fraunce of all honour / and toke from hym al suche landes as he before had gyuen to hym / &amp; crowned hym soone after agayn kyng of England in the sayd cytye of wynchester. After the whych coronacyon he called a parlyament / by vertue wherof he resumyd all parētes and annuytees, fees and other grauntes before hys voyage by hym solde and graunted / and caused the partyes to be contentyd wyth such reuenous and profytes as they had receyued of the sayde offyces or landes in tyme of hys absence / and sparyd not any persone for any sufficience of wrytyng yt to hym before was made.
                     when kynge Rycharde hadde by these foresayd meanes gaderyd some money / he then in the moneth of Iuly sayled into Fraunce, and besegyd a castell callyd Arques, and spedde there as wytnessyth Polycronyca dyuersly. whyche worde dyuersly may well here be spoken. For who so redyth the frenche cronycle / he shall fynde that the Frenche kynge was vyctor. But and he rede the englyshe boke / than shall he fynde kynge Rycharde vyctour. wherfore me thynketh Ranulphe sayde well / when he sayde they spedde dyuersely. For yt is so dyuerse by the reporte of wryters, that the certayntie to whom the honoure shulde be gyuen is harde to be knowen. All be yt that in the countrey of Bloys, as wytnessyth ye sayde frenche cronycle / kynge Rycharde scaryd the Frenche hoste, and toke the kynges somer horse, wyth parte of hys treasour. But in shorte whyle after / a trewce was concludyd betwene these two kynges for a yere.
                     Then Iohn̄ whyche hadde tourned to the Frenche kyng agayne his owne brother, seynge that the fame and honoure of hys brother, &amp; feblenesse of his own power, made meanes to Elyanoure hys mother / by whose medyacyon he was recōcyled to hys brother the kynge, &amp; after became hys trew knyght.
                     when the kynge and hys brother Iohn̄ were thus agreed / they rode ouer the lande to vysyte ye countreys and se howe they were guyded by the offycers of the kynge. Amonge other two there were, whyche shewyd that they wolde do many thynges to the kynges profyte, the one was abbot of Cadonence wythin Normandye / and that other was named wyllyam wyth the longe berde. The abbot warned the kynge of the fraude of hys offycers / wherby he thought by the ponyshement of hys offycers, he shulde wynne great fauoure of the people. Then thys abbot gate a warrant of the kynge / and at London callyd dyuerse offycers before hym, for to yelde to hym theyr accompte. But he dyed shortly / so that hys purpose came to small effecte. And wyllyam wyth the longe berde shewyd to the kynge the outrage of the ryche men / whych as he sayd sparyd theyr owne and pyllyd the poore people.
                     It is sayd that this willyam was borne in London / &amp; purchasyd that name by vse of hys berde. He was sharpe of wytte and somedeale lettred, a bold man of speche and sadde of countenaunce, and toke vppon hym greatter dedes then he coulde welde / and some he vsyd cruelly, as apperyth in appechynge of hys own brother of treason the whyche was a Burges of London, and to hym hadde shewed great kyndnesse in his youthe.
                     
                        This willyam styred and excyted the cōmon peple to desyre &amp; loue fredom̄ and lybertye / and blamed the excesse and outrage of ryche men. By suche meanys he drew to hym many great companyes / and wyth all hys power defended the poore mennys cause agayne the ryche / and accused dyuers to the kynge, shewyng that by theyr meanys the kynge loste many forfaytes &amp; escheatys. For this, gentylmen and men of honour malygned agayn hym. But he had such cōforte of the kynge, that he kepte on his purpose. Then the kynge beynge warned of the congregacyons that thys wyllyam made / commaūded hym to cease of such doynges, yt the people myght exercise theyr artes &amp; occupacyōs / by reason wherof it was left for a while. But it was not long or the people folowed hym as they before that tyme had done. Then he made vnto them colacyons or exhortacyons / and toke for hys anteteme, Haurietis aquas in gaudio de fontibus saluatoris. That is to mean, ye shall drawe in ioye waters of the wellis of our sauyour. And to this he added, I am sayde he the sauyour of poore men: ye be poore, and haue assayed ye harde handes of riche men. Now draw ye therfore holefull water of lore of my wellys, &amp; that wyth ioy / for the tyme of your vysytacyon is comen. I shall (sayde he) departe waters from waters / by waters I vnderstande the people. Then shall I departe the people whychis good and meke, from the people that ys wycked and prowde / and I shall dysseuyr the good and the ylle, as the lyght is departed from ye darkenes. when thys came to the knowlege of the archebyshoppe of Caunterbury / he by counsayll of the lordes of the spyrytualty sent vnto this wyllyam / commaundynge hym to appere before the lordes of the kynges counsayll, to answere vnto suche maters as there shulde be layde vnto hym. At whyche daye thys wyllyam appered, hauyng wyth hym a multytude of people, in so myche that the lordes were of hym adrad. For the whyche cause they remyttyd hym wyth plesaunt wordes for ye time / &amp; commaundyd certayne persones in secrete maner to espye when he were voyde of hys company, and then to take hym, and to put hym in sure kepyng. The whyche accordynge to the commaundement at tyme conuenyent as they thought sette vpon hym and to haue taken hym. But he wyth an axe resysted theym and slewe one of theym / and after fled to saynt Mary Bowe chyrche of Chepe, and toke that for his sauegarde / defendynge hym by strength and not by the suffrages of the chyrche, for to hym drew shortley great multytude of people. But in shorte processe by meane of the heddys and rulers of the cytye the people mynyshed / so yt in shorte tyme he was lefte wyth few personys, &amp; after by fyre cōpellyd to forsake the chyrch and so was taken, but not wythoute shedynge of blood. After whyche takynge he was areygned before the iudges / &amp; there wyth .ix. of his adherētes caste and iudged to dye, &amp; was hanged &amp; they wyth hym the day folowynge. But yet the rumour seased not / for ye cōmon peple reysed a great cryme vpon the archbyshop of Caunterbury &amp; other / and sayd yt by theyr meanes willyam, whych was an innocēt of such crymes as were obiecte &amp; put agayne hym, &amp; was a defendor of the poore people agayn extorcyoners &amp; wronge doers, was by theym put wrongfully to deth / approuyng him an holy mā &amp; martyr by this tale folowyng / sayeng yt a man beyng syke of the feuers, was cured by vertue of a cheyn whych this wyllyam was

bounde wythin tyme of his dures of imprysonement / which by a preste of the allye of the sayde wyllyam was openly declared &amp; preached. wherby he brought the people in suche an errour, that they gaue credence to hys wordes / &amp; secretly in the nyght cōueyed away the iebet that he was hāged vppon, &amp; scraped away ye blood that was shed of him when he was taken or ellys when he was hedded &amp; quarteryd, so yt they made there an holow place by fetchyng away of that erth / and sayde yt syke men &amp; women were cured of dyuerse sykenesse by vertue of that blood &amp; erth. By these means and blowynge of fame / ye place was the more vysyted by women &amp; vndyscrete ꝑsones, of the whych some watched there the hole nyght in prayer / so that the lenger thys cōtynued, the more dysclaunder was anotyd to the iustyces, and to suche as put hym to deth. Not wythstandyng in processe of tyme, when hys actes were publysshed, as the sleynge of a man wyth hys owne hande, and vsynge of hys concubyne wythin saynte Mary chyrche in tyme of hys there beynge, as he openly cōfessed in the houre of hys dethe, wyth other detestable crymes: somwhat keled the great flame of the hasty pilgrymage. But not clerely / tyll the archebyshoppe of Caū
                        terbury accursed ye preste yt broughte vp the fyrste fable / and also causyd that place to be watched, that suche idolatry shuld there no more be used

                     IN the moneth of Apryll and ix. yere of kynge Rycharde, when he had prouided to sende forth xx. thousand poūde to the emperour, for full payment of hys raunsome / the pledges whyche had lyen for the same, came sodeynly into England / and shewed vnto the kyng that after his departynge, the emperour sente them vnto the duke of Ostrych, to remayne with him tyll the money were payde. And forther there they shewed that the sayd duke was accursed of ye pope yt then was Innocent ye thyrde, by reason of his wronge done to the kynge / &amp; that his prouynce was greuyd wyth many myscheues. And as the duke rode forth on a daye in hys disport beyng saynt Stephans day, he hurte his fote in such wyse wyth a thorne or other venym / whyche rancled &amp; grewe so sore, ye lastly he shuld dye or cutte yt of. But in hope of recouery he contynued tyll in the ende he was warned that he shulde dye. Then he sent for his byshoppes, and axyd to be assoyled of the sentence of the chyrche whyche he stode in. The whyche was denyed hym / excepte he wolde swere to stande and abyde the ordynaūce and dome of holy chyrch, touchynge the wronge that he hadde done to kynge Rycharde. The duke sware, and was assoyled / and shortly after the two byshoppes pledgys for ye money were delyuered at theyr lybertye. Then kynge Rycharde callyng to mynde that the vttermost daye of the trewes takē betwene hym and the Frenche kynge approched / made hym redy and sayled into Normandye, where before his commyng the Frenche kynge by occasyon of the Normannis as sayth the frenche boke, was entred the coūtrey of Burgys / towarde whom kyng Rycharde

sped hym wyth all possyble spede / so that both hostes laye partyd wyth a ryuer called Osson or Ossyne.
                     Then to folowe the sayenge of the frenche boke, for so myche as the englyshe cronycle spekyth lytle or nothynge of thys acte / lette wyse men that here thys cronycle, constrew yt after theyr dyscrecyons. For all be yt the Frencheman wrote yt to the honour of Frenchmen / yet to other that shall rede or here yt, because yt soundyth so nere vntrouth, yt shal rather redounde vnto theyr dyshonour. For the Frenche cronicle sayth, that these two hostes thus as aboue is sayde lyenge to gyther wythout skyrmshe or assaute / kynge Rycharde contrary the opinyon and mynde of hys lordes, wyth a few accompanyed and vnharnaysed, shuld come to ye Frēche kynges tente / and there in presence of hys lordes shulde do homage to the Frenche kynge for the duchye of Normandye and coūteys of Angeou and of Poytyers, and there swore to the kynge to kepe peace duryng his lyfe / and after .viii. dayes met agayn and fynyshed the sayde peace, wyth assuryd othe vppon eyther partye / and after departed as frendes eyther resortyng into theyr owne countrey. But yt semed a feynte peace. For within foure monethes or lesse folowynge / kynge Rycharde wyth hys hoste entred the prouynce of Berry / and layd syege to the castell of wyersoune, and gate yt by strength / and after yode to the castell of Noryncourte / the whyche was delyueryd to hym by appoyntement.
                     when kyng Phylyppe harde of the wynnynge and ouerthrowe of the castell of wyersoun / he in damagynge of kynge Rychard layde syege to the castell of Aubeuyle, and yt assayled egerly. Buy yt was so stronge and so well defendyd by the Normannys, that the Frenche kynge was holden of. when kynge Rycharde had garnyshed and fortifyed the castell of Noryncourte wyth all thynge necessarye to the warre / he drewe hym towarde Aubeuyle to remoue kynge Phylyppe from that syege, and fell vppon the Frenche men vnwarely. But the Frenchemen quyt theym so knyghtly, that they chased kyng Rycharde and hys people / and toke a Norman knyghte named Guy de Thonars a man of great hardynes. And then kynge Phylyppe returned to the castel and towne of Aubeuyle / and assauted it more sharpely, so that in the ende ye souldyours of the town yeldyd yt wyth the castell for a certayne summe of money. And when he hadde possessyon of the towne / he threw downe the castell playne wyth the ground, and after strengthed the towne wyth Frenche men / and then yode to the castell of Gysours / and from thēs resorted to the forenamed castell of Noryncourte, and assayled yt in so cruell maner, that shortely he wanne yt / and toke therin .xv. knyghtes and .xxiiii. yemen, wyth plente of vytayll and armour. In thys tyme and season kynge Richarde gadered newe strength, and allyed hym wyth Baldwyn erle of Flaūdres and with Renolde erle of Dampmartyn and of Boleyne. By whose meanes as wytnessyth the frenche boke, kynge Rychard wasted sore the countrey of Fraunce / and brent therin some townes and vyllages, and toke therein many ryche prayes.

                        ABout the begynnynge of the moneth of October, and .x. yere of Rycharde / the sayde Rycharde entryd the countrey of Unequecyne wyth a stronge hoste / and made therin cruell warre, in destroyenge of the countrey / and assauted the castell of Gysours / and threwe to grounde a stronge holde called Courcellys, and brent there about many vyllages. wherwyth kynge Phylyppe was so greuousely amouyd / yt wyth a small noumber of knyghtes he percyd the hoste of Englyshemen, and entryd the castell or towne of Gysours. But of his men were taken a certayn nō
                        ber / as Alayne de Russy, Mathewe de Melly, Guyllyam de Mello, and many other. wyth the whyche prysoners and many riche prayes, kyng Richarde then departed, leuynge the Frenche kynge wythin Gysours.
                     It was not longe after that kynge Rycharde was thus departed / but that kyng Phylyp callyng to mynde the great losse and dishonour that he had receyued by that warre of kynge Rycharde, assembled a great army, and entred the duchy of Normandy / and wasted the coūtrey from Nuesbourth to Beawmōt le Rogyer. And that done he returned into Fraunce / and lycēcyd hys knyghtes to go eche man into hys owne countrey.
                     when kynge Phylyppe hadde thus fynyshed hys warre in Normandye / kynge Rycharde then wyth hys armye entred the forenamed countrey of Unequecyn, and also Beawuoysyn / and toke wythin theym as he before had done ryche &amp; many prayes / and with theym departed. whom the byshop of Beawuays beyng a good knyghte and hardy of his handes, wyth a companye of knyghtes, and other / folowyd to haue rescowyd the prysoners that kynge Rycharde had taken. But they were taken / and a certayne of hys company slayne.
                     Then the erle of Flaundres by the ayde of the Englyshe men, toke the towne of saynt Omer from ye Frēche men.
                     In this season Innocent the Pope before named, sente a legate into Fraunce named Peter de Capys, to refourme the warre betwene the two prynces. The whyche at that tyme was in such dysioynte that he coulde not brynge yt to any frame / and specyally as sayth the Frenche boke, because kynge Richarde wolde not delyuer hostages &amp; gagys as ye Frēche kynge wolde.
                     Then kynge Rycharde after Cristmas besyeged a castel nere vnto Lymogys. Thys castell in ye Frēche cronycle is called Chalons / &amp; in the englyshe boke yt is named Gayllarde. The cause of this syege as saith most wryters, was for certayne ryche treasour founden wythin the lordshyppe or sygnyory of kynge Rycharde / the whyche one wydomer vycounte of Lemonke hadde founden and wyth helde from kynge Rycharde / and for hys sauegarde fledde vnto the forenamed castell / and defendyd yt manfully from the fyrste weke of lent, tyll the .vi. daye of Apryll. Uppon the whyche daye kynge Rycharde walkynge vnwysely about the castell to espye the feblenes therof / one named Betrāde Guedon markyd the kynge and wounded him in the hedde, or after some writers, in ye arme with a venemous quarell. After which woūde receyued by the kynge, he commaunded sharpe assaute to be made / in the whyche assaute the castell was won. Then he made enquery who yt was that so had wounded him / the which was brought vnto the kynges presence, and named hym self as aboue is sayde, or after some writers Peter Basyle. Then the kynge demaūded

of him why he shuld so lye in a wayte to hurte hym, rather then any of his felowys. For thou slew my father &amp; my bretherne sayde he / wherfore I entendyd to auenge theyr deth, what someuer became of me. Then ye kyng forgaue hym his offence and sufferyd him to go at lyberte. And the other of ye soudyours taken in that castell, the kynge commaunded to be hanged. But Polycronycon sayth, that after kynge Rycharde was dede / the duke of Braban whych then was present, causyd the sayde Bartrande to be taken and flayne quycke and after hanged. Then kynge Rycharde dyed the .iii. daye after, that is to say, the ix. daye of Apryll / and was buryed at Fount Eborard at the fete of hys father. Howe be yt some wryters say that his harte was buryed at Roan, his body as before is sayde, and hys bowellys at Carleyll in Englande / when he hadde reygned .ix. yeres .ix. monethes and odde dayes, leuynge after hym none yssue. Of thys Rycharde a metrycyan made these versys folowynge.

But for they wolde that the Frenche kynge shulde repayre and amēde suche houses of relygyon, as he had hurte &amp; ouerthrowen in Guyan and other places belongynge to the crowne of Englande / therfore he forsoke the peace / not withstandyng that kynge Iohn̄ in lyke wyse shuld haue repayred all lyke houses apperteynynge vnto ye crowne of Fraunce.
                     Then the Frenche kynge in the ende of Auguste layde syege to the castell of Raydepount / &amp; assauted yt by the terme of .xv. dayes contynually. But the soundyours wythin defendyd yt so manfully, that they slewe many of theyr enymyes / so ye kynge Phylyppe was fayne to gyue backe, tyll he hadde deuysed newe engynes after the warre fassyon. By reason wherof he lastely wanne the sayde castell / and toke there .xx. knyghtes, and an hundred and .vii. yomen and other, and .xxi. arblasters. And when he hadde fortefyed that castell wyth Frenche men / he then yode to the castell of Gaylarde, and layde hys ordynaunce to that, as he hadde done to that other. But he laye there a moneth or he myghte do to yt any hurte or harme. In all whych season kyng Iohn̄ warryd vppon the Borderers of Fraunce / but of hys vyctoryes I fynde lytle wryten.

                     But for the sayde maters of obieccyon were by hym and hys courte thoughte insuffycyent / he therefore exorted and wyllyd hym to accepte the sayde archebyshopppe to hys grace, and suffre hym to enioye the frutes of hys benefyce / and the munkes by hym exyled, to retourne vnto theyr proper abbay.

The kyng for thys dede was so amouyd wyth the sayde foure byshoppes, that he seased all the temporalties to them belongyng into hys handes / and put theym in such fere, that they forsoke this land, and sayled to the archbyshop of Caū

                     IN the moneth of nouēber and vii. yere of the kynge / one named Hugh Oysell for treason at Lon was drawen and hanged. And thys yere in ye moneth of May, the French kynge entryd into Normandy wyth

a strōge power / and wanne there the castellys of Faloys, and Dafyount or Danffrount and after seasyd all the landes to the sayde castell belongynge, and so tyll he came to a place called saynte Mychaell in the parell of the see.
                     when the Normannes sawe that kynge Phylyppe thus subdued the stronge holdes of Normandye, and that kynge Iohn̄ to the countrarye made no defence / ye capytayns of Cō
                        staunce, of Bayoux or Bayon, of Lyseux, of Anreuches, and Enroux yelded them all to the French kyng, and became hys lyege men / so that he was in possessyon of the substaū
                        ce of the duchye of Normandye, excepte Roan and other few castellys.
                     Then kynge Phylyppe seynge these stronge holdes thus yeldyd vnto hym / layed hys syege to the cyty of Roan. where after he hadde lyen a season / the capytayne of the towne desyred a respyte of .xxx. days, gyuynge pledges and hostages, that yf the cytye were not by kynge Iohn̄ or hys assygnes rescwyd wyth in the foresayde terme, they wolde yelde the cytye vnto the French kynge. And in lyke wyse was appoyntement taken for the castellys named Arquys and Uermeyll. In whyche tyme for that no socoure came / both cytye and castellys were delyueryd into the Frenche kynges handes. And thus hadde thys seconde Phylyppe the possessyon of Normandye / whyche no Frenche kynge hadde sen the tyme of Charlys the symple, whyche gaue the same duchye to Rollo leder of the Normannys, wyth Gylla hys doughter in maryge / synne the whyche tyme hadde passed ouer iii. hundred yeres.
                     when the Frenche kynge had thus brought into his subiccyon ye duchye of Normandye / he then about saynt Laurence tyde yode into the countye of Guyan, and wanne there the cytye of Poytyers, wyth all the castellys and townes to the sayde cytye belongynge. and when he hadde sette that countrey in an order and rule / he spedde hym into Fraunce wyth great pompe and glory.
                     It ys affermed of some authours, that the Frenche kynge made thys warre vppon kynge Iohn̄ by excytynge of the pope, for hys contumacye agane the chyrche.
                     In thys yere also was a communycacyon of a peace to be hadde betwene kynge Iohn̄ and the archebyshope of Caunterbury / and was dryuen to a nere poynte of accorde, except restitucyon that kynge Iohn̄ shulde haue made to the archebysshop and other bishoppes, the which his offycers hadde taken in the tyme of theyr absence. To the whych restytucyon kynge Iohn̄ in no wyse wold be agreable / wherfore the sayd communycacyon toke none affecte. After thys communycacyon / kynge Iohn̄ was so frette wyth malyce, that in a fury he let proclayme in sondry placys of hys realme, that all suche personys as hadde landes and possessyons wythin Englande spyrytuall or temporall, that they shulde returne into Englande by Mychelmas next folowynge / or ellys to be clerely excludyd from all suche landes. And ouer that streyght commaundement was gyuen to eueryche officer in his countrey, to make besye serche, yf any wrytynges were broughte from the courte of Rome, to any prelate of thys realme / and yf any suche were founden, to brynge hym and his wrytynges to the kynges presence. And more ouer that they shuld sease to the kynges vse, all suche landes as to any person were gyuen by the sayde archbyshoppe or by the pryour

of Caunterbury, syn the tyme of eleccyon of the sayd archebyshoppe / and the woodes of the same to be fellyd and solde in all haste.

And thys yere rebellyd the Iryshemē, and dyd myche harme in that countrey. whych rebellyon after some wryters was, for so myche as the kynge wolde haue leuyed of thē greuous taskys to haue made warre wyth vppon the French kynge. But at lengthe they greuyd or dyspleasyd the kyng in such wyse, that he was fayne to sette a taske thorough hys land to oppresse theyr malyce. And ouer that he asked of the whyte munkes of England .vi. thousande marke. But they excused them by theyr generall hedde / so that the kynge toke wyth theym great dyspleasure. By reason wherof after his retourne oute of Irlande, he vexyd theym sore / and gatheryd of theym more then before he hadde desyred / and caused some abbottys to forsake theyr houses.
                     Then he wyth a puyssaunte armye wente into Irelande, and shortely subdued theym / and after he hadde sette the countrey in a rule, he retourned into Englande.

Then kynge Iohn̄ spedde hym towarde the Frenche kynge / so that in shorte processe of tyme the two hostys were wythin lytle dystaunce. But by what meane of fortune I can

not saye (for the meane therof ys not expressyd) the two kynges there toke peace for two yeres folowynge / and after eyther of theym retourned into his owne countrey.
                     In this yere the pope beyng ascerteyned of ye cruelnesse of kyng Iohn̄ executed agayne the whyte munkes of hys lande / and also of his obstynacye that he perseuered in agayne holy chyrche: sent done a new commyssyon / by vertue wherof the curse of enterdytynge was newly denoūcyd and manyfestyd in sondry places of England. And ouer that the pope by authoryte of the sayde bulle, assoyled or acquyted all the lordes of Englād as well spyrytuall as temporall, of all homage and feauty that they of ryght owyd to the kynge / to the entent that they shulde aryse agayne hym, and depryue hym of all kyngly honour. But all this myght not moue the kynge from hys errour.
                     ABout the feast of saynt Medard, in the moneth of Iuny and later ende of this foresayd .ix. yere / the forenamed bayllyues were admytted to ye offyce / and the olde, that is to meane Roger wynchester and Edmunde Hardell were dischargyd, for so myche as they wythstode the kinges purueyour of whete, &amp; wold not suffer him to conuey certayn mesures of whete oute of the cytye tyll the cytye were storyd. For thys the kynge toke such dyspleasure, that he sent downe streyght cōmaundement vnto the .xxxv. heddes or rulers of the cytye, that they shulde dyscharge the sayde two bayllyuys, and to put theym in pryson tyll they knewe the kynges further pleasure. wherfore the sayd .xxv. persons toke aduyse / &amp; appoynted a certayne of theym selfe wyth other, and rode to the kynge then beynge at Langley, to empeter grace for the sayde bayllyues / shewynge forther that at that season such dystresse of where was in ye cyty, that the common people were lyke to haue made an insurreccyon for the same. By whyche meanes and frendeshyppe whyche they had in the court, the kynge was so satysfyed that he releasyd theym from pryson. And in short tyme after, the cytesyns of London made such sute to the kyng, that they had graunted to them by ye kynges letters patentes,Fyrst mayred

And in thys yere ye monastery of saynte Mary Ouereys in South warke, was begonne of to be buylded.

                     Of ye maner of this enterdyccyon of this lande, haue I sene dyuerse opynyons. As some there be ye saye, that the lande was enterdyted thorouly / and the chyrches, and housys of relygyon closyd, that no where was vsed masse nor dyuyne seruyce. By which reason none of the .vii. sacramētes in all this terme shulde be minystred or occupyed, nor chylde crystenyd, nor man confessyd, nor maryed. But yt was not so streyghte / for there were dyuerse places in Englande whyche were occupyed wyth dyuyne seruyce all that season, by lycence purchasyd then or before. Also chyldren were crystyned thorough all the land, and men houselyd and anelyd / excepte suche persones as were excepted by name in the bull, or knowē for mayteyners of the kynges yll entent.

                     IN thys .xv. yere of the kynge / the peace whych in the laste yere was betwene kyng Iohn̄ and his baronyes agreed, was by the kynge vyolate and broken. wherfore the lordes assembled to them great powers &amp; made sharpe &amp; cruell warre vppon the kynge / in so myche that he was constrayned to sende into Normandye for ayde and socoure, &amp; into other places. Then shortely after came into Englande a Norman knyghte, whyche brought wyth hym a companye of Normannes, Flemmynges, &amp; Pycardes. This knyght or capitayn was named Foukes de Brent / ye whiche wyth his company was so cruell, that he destroyed as well relygyous houses as other, and wrought mych harme to the lande, and putte the lordes to the worse. Then the kynge made Foukes and other of hys company wardeyns of castellys &amp; strūge holdes in Englād. The lordes seyng the kynge perseuer in hys wronge, and wolde in no wyse be enduced to holde his owne grauntes / but to execute all thynge after pleasure, and nothynge after lawe or iustyce: cast in theyr myndes howe they myghte brynge the lande in a better rule or state / and by one aduyse and consent wrote vnto Phylyp kyng of Fraūce, that he wolde sende some noble man into Englande / and they wolde rendre ye lande vnto hym. In this whyle kyng Iohn̄ causid to be drawen and hangyd at London one Pyers of Pomfrette / for the sayde Peter had monyshed dyuers mysse happes that shulde come to hym for his vycyous lyfe / and also for he had often warned kynge Iohn̄ that he shuld reygn but .xiiii. yeres / the whyche he ment wythout payenge of trybute. For after he was become feodary to the pope / he thought the pope reygned as pryncypall lorde of the land and not he. For the whyche and for other malyce he putte that vertuous man to deth. Of whom in ye .xxxiii. chapiter of the .vii. boke of Policronycon are many vertues shewed / the which I ouer passe for lengthynge of the tyme.

And about saynte Margaretes daye, he wyth the lordes came agayne to London / at whose commynge the towre of London was gyuen vp to theym by appoyntement. And where Roger fyz Aleyn hadde tyll that tyme rulyd the cytye of London as mayre / he for so myche as he was accusyd to the lordes to be fauorable to the kynges partye, was then dyscarged of that offyce / and one called Serle Mercer was chosen in hys place, and so cōtynued tyll Mychelmas folowynge.

But all hys laboure was in vayne.

After whyche othe to hym geuen / the kynge charged hym by vertue of the same, that he shulde not take of the bakers and bruers and other vytellars of the cytye .xl. pounde, whyche other of his predecessours, and also he that laste yere hadde taken. And also that he incontynently after hys commynge to London, shuld restore vnto the sayd vytellars and other cytesyns, all suche money as he hadde wyth wronge in that precedyng yere taken of the comynaltye of the citye. But for the sayde Gerarde allegyd for hym certayne consideracyons, be sechynge the kynge to pardon hym of that restytucyon / the kynge in dyspleasure swore a great othe, that he shulde not that yere be mayre, nor at any tyme there after. And so the commons certyfyed of the kynges pleasure, chase in his place or stede / Reyner de Bungaye. And this yere the kynge yode into walys. wherof herynge Dauid then prynce of walys, mette wyth the kyng at Ruthlande / and submyttyd hym to the kynges grace.

All be yt in hys legende yt is shewyd that he dyed twentye myle from Pountnay called Soly / and was after buryed and translated at Poūtnay.

                        IN this .xxvi. yere of kyng Henry / Bonyface was sacryd archbyshoppe of Caunterbury. And this yere the kyng wyth a fayre company saylyd into Normandy. whyche vyage as sayth ye frenche cronycle was made by the styrynge of a Frenche man named erle of the Marche / for so myche as ye sayd erle refusyd to do homage vnto Alphons brother vnto Lewys the .x. of that name, and surnamed saynte Lewys then kynge of Fraunce. Thys Lewys the yere before hadde maryed his sayde brother vnto the doughter of the erle of Tholouse / and hadde gyuen to his sayde brother the erledome of Poyteau, wyth all the landes of Aluerne.
                     By reason wherof he wold haue causyd the sayd erle of Marche, to haue done homage vnto the sayde Alphōs for such landes as the sayd erle held of the sayde erledome of Poytyers. But for ye sayd erle of Marche knew well that the ryght of Guyan belongyd to the kinge of England / he therfore, and for other allyaunces made bewene kynge Henry and hym, refusyd the doynge of that homage / and after came to kynge Henry, and excytyd hym to make warre vppon the Frenche kynge. By reason wherof the kynge made prouysyon, and so landed with a stronge power at Burdeaux. After the affyrmaunce of the frenche boke, this erle of the Marchis had maryed the mother of kyng Henry.
                     Then it folowyth in this whyle the Frenche kynge warryd vppon ye landes of the erle of Marche / and hadde wōne .ii. castellys of his named Foūteneys and Uyllers, wyth dyuerse other whych I passe ouer. And when he had beten downe some of them, &amp; some storyd with new soudyours / he then went vnto a castel named Maucoune, and brake a brydge after him, for so myche as he was warned that the kynge of Englande was nere vnto hym. At the sayd brydge was a lyttell skyrmyshe / but lytle harme was there done. Then the Frenche kynge toke the way ouer the ryuer of Tharent towarde Taylbourgh, wastyng and destroyenge the countrey as he went / and so forth towarde the town callyd Saynces. And kynge Henry wyth hys hoste made towarde hym in al that he myght. In kepyng this course / the vawarde of the kynge encountryd wyth the erle of Boleyne, whyche was vppon the Frenche kyngys partye. That season the erle of Saynces bare the banner of ye erle Marches, beyng in ye vaward of the kynge. Betwene these two erles was sore fyght / so that many a man vppon both partyes was slayn / among the whych the sayde erle of Saynces was slayne. Then came on bothe strengthes vppon eyther syde, so that both kynges fought in that batayll / and great slaughter of men was vppon both sydes. But in the ende the Frenche men were vyctours, &amp; toke prysoners .xxii. men of name, as knyghtes and of hygher degre, and .iii. clerkes of great fame and ryches, besyde other to the nomber of .v. hūdred of meane people as wytnessyth the frenche boke. But of these men of name, nor yet of the ryche clerkes, none is named, nor yet shewyd what good they payed for theyr raōsome. wherfore me lyste to wryte no farther of this great victory / all be it yt the sayd boke sayth farther, that kyng Henry for fere tourned backe vnto Burdeaux / and there made meanes to the kynge of Fraunce for a peace. But of all thys fynde I no worde in the englyshe cronycles.
                     Then the erle of Marches by meane of his sonne, was reconcyled vnto the Frenche kynge, amd restoryd to

hys landes / excepte thre castellys, whyche were named Mespyne, Cretaye, and Estardye / the whyche the Frenche kynge retayned in his owne possessyon. And soone after came vnto the Frenche kynge the lordes of the castellys of Myrabell, &amp; of Mortaynge / submyttynge theym also vnto the kynges grace / besechyng hym of pardon, that they hadde so to his hygh dyspleasure fauored hys enymy the kynge of Englande. And after came in dyuerse other lordes &amp; capytaynes / so that he was in possessyon of all the countrey of Guyan &amp; Poyteau, vnto ye ryuer of Gyroūde.
                     I haue rehersyd the more of thys cronycle of Fraunce / to the entente that the reders may well apperceyue the pryde and boste of the Frēchmen. For in all theyr wrytynge, when they come to any mater that soūdyth any thynge to theyr honour / yt is wryten in the lengest and most shewyng maner to theyr honour and worshyppe. But as I haue sayde before in the v. capyter of the storye of the .ii. Phylyppe kynge of Fraunce / yf yt sound any thynge to theyr dyshonour, then shall yt be abreuyatyd or hyd, that the trouth shall not be knowen. And that appereth well here by theyr own wrytynge. For in ye .vii. yere of kyng Iohn̄, yt is shewyd howe Phylyppe the seconde then kynge of Fraunce had wonne all Normandy and Guyan. And yet at thys daye thys kynge Lewys warryd agayne in the same countrey / so that they euer tell of the wynnyng, but they touche nothynge of the agayne losynge.
                     Then yt folowyth in the storye / when kynge Henry hadde as before is sayde, concludyd the foresayde peace, of the which by myne authour is no terme sette / the kynge retourned into Englande.

And when ye sayd xxxvi. persones were presentyd before the sayde Iohn̄ Mansell, Henry Baa iustycys &amp; other / the sayd Iohn̄ sayde vnto theym, that they vppon theyr othe shuld certyfye all such persones as they knewe gylty in the artycles before vnto the comynaltye shewyd. wherunto the sayde .xxxvi. cytesyns answeryd, yt yt was contrary theyr lybertyes to be sworne so many, for any mater of trespas betwene the kynge and any of hys cytezyns / wherfore they requyred a sparynge. wyth whych answere the sayd Iohn̄ Mansell beynge dyscontentyd / warnyd theym to appere before the kynges coūsayll at ye Guyldehall vppon the morowe folowynge / where they kepte theyr daye. And thyther came the sayde iustycys Iohn̄ Mansell, &amp; Henry Baa, syr Henry wengham chaunceller of Englande, Phylyppe Louell vndertreasorer, and dyuerse other of the kynges counsayll.
                     Then the sayde Iohn̄ Mansell exortyd the sayde personys to be sworne by many meanys, as he the other daye hadde done. But all was in vayne / for they excusyd theym alway that yt was contrary theyr othe and lybertye of theyr cytye. wherfore the kynges counsayll departed from the hall in partye dyscontentyd, &amp; shewyd vnto the kynge the demeanour of the sayde cytesyns.
                     Uppon the euen of ye Purificacyon of our lady, yt mayre beyng warned yt the kyng shuld come to westmynster / he wyth the more parte of the Aldermen rode vnto Knyghtbrydge, and houyd there to salute the kynge, and to knowe his forther pleasure. But when the kynge came nere that place and harde of theyr beynge there / he sent vnto them a squyre of houshold and chargyd theym that they shulde not presume to come in hys syght. wyth whyche message they beynge greatly dyscōfortyd, retourned home to the cytye. Afterwarde in the Octauys of the puryfycacyon of our Ladye, returned from the courte Mychaell Tony and Adam Basynge / the whyche before were sente by the mayre to such frendes as they had in the courte, to knowe the cause of the kynges hyghe dyspleasure. The whych brought worde that the kyng was well mynded vnto the citye / but

he was in full purpose to haue suche persones chastised that hadde oppressyd the comynaltye of the same. Uppon the morow folowynge, came vnto ye Guyldhall Iohn̄ Mansell wyth other of the kynges counsayll / the whych to the people there assembled, shewyd many fayre &amp; plesaunt wordes. Amonge the whych he declared that the kynges mynde &amp; wyll was, to correcte all suche persones as had oppressyd the comynaltye of that his deryste belouyd cytye / and asked of the commons whyther they wolde be agreable vnto the same. The whych incontynently many suche as knewe litle what the mater ment, cryed with out dyscrecyon, ye, ye, ye, nothynge regardynge the lybertye of the cytye. And after ye graūt thus had of the cō
                        mons / the sayde Iohn̄ Mansell dyschargyd the mayre, shryues, &amp; chamberleyn of theyr offyces / and delyueryd the custodye therof vnto the constable of the towre / and putte in the rome of the shryues Mychaell Tony and Iohn̄ Audryan. And ouer that, all rollys of tollys and tallages before made, were delyueryd vnto the sayd Iohn̄ Māsell / the whych he there sealyd and redeliueryd them vnto the chamberleyne. when the cō
                        mons hadde beholden all thys besynesse, they retourned vnto theyr housys all confusyd.
                     This mater thus orderyd / the sayd Iohn̄ Mansell wyth dyuerse of the kynges counsayll kept theyr courtes dayly the sondayes excepte, tyll the fyrste sondaye of lent, the whych that yere was the .xxv. daye of February / callyng before hym .xii. wardes, of ye cytye. Of the whyche .xii. wardes of eueryche of them was takē thre men, so▪ that of those .xii. wardes .xxxvi. mē were impanellyd and sworne, for to enquyre of the foresayd artycles, and what personys of the cytye had offendyd in them. This courte thus kept and holden at Guyldehall / no man was callyd to answere, nor no questyon put vnto any person by the sayd enquest or by any other. Uppon the sayd sonday of lent, the mayre, aldermen, and shryues, wyth the sayd enqueste, &amp; foure men of euery warde, were chargyd to appere at westmynster before the kynge / at whych apperaunce they were coūtermaūdyd tyll vppon the nexte morowe. At whyche season they commyng into the kynges exchekyr / fonde syttyng there the erles of Glouceter, and of warwyke, Iohn̄ Mansell, Henry Baa iusticys, the cōstable of the towre, the custos of the cytye, and dyuers other of the kynges counsayll. Then was callyd by name Rafe hardell that yere may 
                           •
                        e, Nycholas Batte, Nycholas fyz Iosne, Mathew Bokerel, Iohn̄ Tolesham, and Iohn̄ le Mynoure aldermen. Then sayde Iohn̄ Mansell, yt the kynge by his lawes and inquysycyon of the cytesyns of the cytye, had founden theym culpable, that they had wronged and hurte the comynaltye of hys cytye by dyuers meanes, as by the sayde inquysycyons apperyd / and forthwyth causyd yt to be redde before them. And whē the more parte therof was redde, he sayd vnto theym: thus may you se that the comynaltye of the sayde cytye hath ben by you greuously oppressyd / and by your meanys and counsayll the common weale of the same dystroyed, as by alterynge of the tollys and other good auncyent customys, turnynge them to your synguler auauntage &amp; lucre. All whyche maters the sayde Rafe and his company denyed / and that the commons was not by any suche meanys by them nor none of them greuyd or hurte / and that they offryd to be iustyfyed and iudged by the lawe and customys of the cytye.

Then Henry Baa iustyce, askyd of them whyther they wolde byde the aduenture of the enquery that they hadde harde redde before / or ellys stande vppon the sayeng of the other wardes, that yet had not ben sworne, but they kepte theym to theyr fyrste answere. Then Iohn̄ Mansell frayned of ye mayre what was theyr lawe and custome. The mayre answered and sayde, that for trespace of a cytesyn done agayne ye kynge, he shulde defende hym by .xii. of the sayde cytesyns / and for murder or sleynge of a man by .xxx. cytesyns / &amp; for trespace agayn a straunger by the othe of .vi. and hym selfe. Then after many reasons made by the sayde Iohn̄ Mansell, and also by the mayre and his aldermen / daye was gyuen to them to appere vppon the morow before the kynge and his counsell.
                     Uppon the day folowynge ye kyng wyth many of his lordes syttynge in the sayde exchekyr, the foresayde inquysycyon was redde. And that done the mayre and aldermen were called in by name / and two aldermen more whyche before were not callyd / that is to saye Arnolde Thedmare &amp; Henry walmode. when Rafe Hardell had harde the kynge speke in the mater / he toke suche fere that he and Nycholas Batte wythout farther answere, put them in the kynges grace / sauyd to theym theyr lybertyes and fraunchyses of the cytye. But the other .vi. besought the kyng of his ryght wysenes that they myghte then be demyd after the lawes and customys of the cytye. Then was layde vnto theyr charge that ouer many wronges by theym done to the kynge and the comynaltye of the cytye, they had alteryd ye kynges beame, and orderyd it to the aduauntage of them selfe and other ryche men of the cytye. wherun to the partyes answeryd, and sayde that the alteracion of the beame was not done by them onely / but by ye aduyce and consente of .v. hundred of the beste of the cytye. For where before tyme the weyer vsyd the lene hys draught towarde the marchaundyse so that the byar hadde by that meane x. or xii. pounde in a draught to hys aduauntage, and the seller so myche dysauauntage / nowe for indyfferencye and egalytye of both personys or marchaūtys, was ordeyned that the beame shulde stand vpryght, ye cle

                        e therof enclynynge to neyther partie / as yt doth in weyenge of golde and syluer / and the byer to haue alowed of the seller for all thynges .iiii. poūde onely in euery draught.
                     After these reasons and other by theym made / the kynge commaunded that vpon the mornynge folowynge, a folkmoot shulde be callyd at Paulys crosse / &amp; so that courte was dyssoluyd, and the mayre &amp; the other returned to London. Uppon the morowe the folkmoot beynge at Pawles crosse assemblyd / these .vi. aldermen heryng the murmuracion of the common people, and knowynge that the aldermen nor the worshypfull of the city shuld haue litle or no sayeng in thys mater, ferynge theyr cause yode into a chanons house of Powlys / where at that tyme the sayde Iohan Mansel and other sent from the kynge taryed the assemblynge of the people / and shewyd vnto theym that they entedyd not any lenger to plede wyth the kynge, but were contentyd to put them fully in the kynges grace and mercy / sauyng alway to them and all other cytesyns theyr lybertye and fraunchyse of the cyte. After whyche agrement the sayde. Iohan Mansell wyth the other came vnto the courte of Folkmoot / where vnto the people was rehersyd a fayre and a pleasaunt tale, promysyng to them

that theyr lybertyes shulde be hooly and inuyolatly preseruyd by ye kyng, wyth many other thynges to ye great comforte of the common people. And lastely was axyd of them wheter the law and custome were such as aboue is rehersyd or no. wherunto lyke vndyscret and vnlerned people they answeryd &amp; cryed rabbyshely nay, nay, nay / not wythstādynge that the sayd law and custome hadde before tymes ben vsed tyme oute of mynde. But to thys was nother mayre nor aldermen nor other of the great of the cytye that myghte impugne or make any reason, for the vpholdynge of theyr auncyent lawys or customys.
                     And no wonder though the kynge were thus hedy or greuouse to the cytye / for by suche euyll dysposyd and malycyouse people as he had aboute hym, the lande was yll rulyd, &amp; mych myschefe was vsyd. wherof ensuyd myche sorow after, as ye shall here in the sequele of the storye. Then Iohn̄ Mansell callyd the mayre and aldermen before hym / and chargyd them to be at westmynster the morowe folowynge, to gyue attendaunce vppon the kynges grace. Uppon the morow the mayre and aldermen taryenge the kynges commynge in the great hall at westmynster / lastely the kynge came into saynte Stephaus chapell. where a season he helde a coū
                        sayll wyth his lordes / and after yode into the chekyr chamber, &amp; there sat hym downe and hys lordes aboute hym. Anon after the mayre and aldermen were callyd into the sayde chamber, and soone there after callyd by name, and commaundyd to stande nere to the barre. Then Henry Baa iustyce sayde vnto the mayre and the vii. aldermen, that for so myche as by fourme of the kynges lawes, they were founde culpable in certayne articles touchynge trāsgressyon agayn the kynge / therfore the courte awardyd that they shulde make fyne and raunsome after the dyscrecyon of the sayde courte. But for they hadde put theym in the kynges grace and mercy / the kynge hath commaundyd the fyne to be put in respyte, that ye be not payned so greuously as ye haue deseruyd. After whyche iudgement gyuen, they kneled downe / and then the mayre wyth wepynge terys, thanked the kynge of his bountye &amp; goodnesse, and besought hym to be good and gracyous lorde vnto the cytye, and vnto them as hys faythfull subiectys. whereunto the kynge made none answere, but rose streyght vppe and so yode hys waye leuynge them there. Anon as the kynge was departyd, they were all arestyd and kepte there, tyll they had founden suerty / and eueryche alderman of theym dyscharged of his warde &amp; offyce yt they had wythin the cytye. But shortly after they put in suertyes, and so returnyd heuely to London And shortely after was wyllyam fyz Rycharde by the kynges commaundement made mayre, and Thomas fyz Thomas and wyllyam Grappysgate shryues. After this, daye by daye the chamberlayn was callyd to accōpte before the sayde Iohn̄ Mansell, of all suche tollys as were gadered in tyme of the mayraltie of Iohn̄ Tolesham and of Rafe Hardell / beynge present to here the sayde accompte dyuerse of the comynaltie of the cytye, but none of the heddys. By the whyche accompt no defaute myght be arrectyd vnto any of the forenamed persones conuycte afore the kynge. By reason wherof dyuerse of theym were admyttyd to the kynges fauour shortly after, and restored to theyr offyces agayne / but not wythout payeng of money, wher of the certaynte is not knowen. And in this yere whete was so scāte,

yt was solde at London for .xxiiii.s. a quarter. And scanter shulde haue ben, yf plenty hadde not come out of Almayne / for in Fraunce and Normandye yt fayled in lykewyse. By meane of this derth &amp; scarcytie, mych poore people dyed for hunger / and many of dyuerse countreys of Englande came vnto the citye, and nere there aboute for comforte of vytayll / for yt then was better chepe in London then in many shyres of England there aboute. And soone after was the forenamed Iohn̄ Mansell made knyghte &amp; chefe iustyce of England.
                     IN thys .xli. yere also / ye kynge about the feast of saynt Barna be in the moneth of Iuny, kepte hys hyghe courte of parlyament at hys towne of Oxenforde. Thys of some wryters is named insane parliamentum) that is to meane the woode or madde parlyament. For at this counsayll were made many actys agayne the kynges prerogatyue &amp; pleasure, for the reformacion of the state of the lande / whyche after prouyd to the cō
                        fusyon and hurte of the lande, &amp; deth and destruccyon of many noble men / so that by occasyon therof began the famouse stryfe callyd at thys day the Barons warre. wherof ensued mych myschefe as hereafter shalbe shewyd and declared more at large.
                     Then as aboue is sayde, to auoyde the enormytes and to refourme the euyll rule then vsyd in the lande, by suche personys as dayly were about the kynge / many and dyuerse ordynaunces were made, wherof the tenoure is sette oute in the ende of this boke. wherunto the kynge somdeale agayne hys wyll, wyth syr Edwarde hys sonne and other agreed. And for these actys shulde be holden ferme &amp; stable / at thys parlyament was chosyn .xii. Perys, whyche were named Douze Peris / to whō authorite was gyuen by strength of this parliamēt. to correcte all such as offendyd in brekynge of these ordinaūces and other, by the sayd twelue Perys after to be deuysed and orderyd, touchyng and cōcernynge ye same mater &amp; purpose. Of whyche .xii. Perys the names ensue. Fyrste the archebyshop of Caunterburye, the byshoppe of worceter, syr Roger Bygotte then erle of Norffolk and marshall of Englande, syr Symonde de Moūtforde erle of Leyceter, syr Rychard Clare erle of Glouceter, syr Humfrey Bothum-erle of Herforde, of warwyke, and of Arundell, syr Iohn̄ Mansell chefe iustyce of Englande, syr Roger Mortymer, syr Hugh Bygraue, syr Petyr de Sauoy, syr Iamys Audeley, and syr Peter de Mountforde. And for the kynges brother vppon the moders syde, that is to saye syr Eym erle of wynchester, syr wyllyam de Ualaūce, syr Godfrey de Lindesey, and syr Guyde Lyndesey, wold not assente vnto the foresayde ordynaunces / they wythdrew them toward the see syde wyth suche stuffe as they hadde, and wold haue departyd ye land yf they myght then haue had shyppynge / for lacke wherof they were fayne to retourne, and so yode vnto wynchester. But yt was not longe after that they were lycensyd to departe the lande wyth a certayne companye, and a certayne summe of money to paye for theyr costys / and theyr daye sette by Bartylmew tyde to auoyde vppon payne of prysonement, whyche daye by them was kepte.
                     It was not longe after the fynysshynge of this parlyament, but that stryfe and varyaūce began to kyndle betwene the kynge and the erlys of Leyceter and of Glouceter, by meane of such offycers as the sayd erles had remouyd and put other in theyr romys.

Amonge the whyche Iohan Māsell was dyscarged of his offyce. and syr Hugh Bygotte then admytted for hym. And for the foresayde Pyers harde of the murmure in the courte, ferynge that the kynge shuld be aduertysed shortely to alter from his promyse / therfore they entēdyng to make theyr partye the strōger, vppon the morowe folowynge Marye Magdaleyns daye / the kyng beyng at westmynster, the erle Marshall, the erle of Leyceter, wyth dyuerse other came vnto the Guyldehall of Lōdon, where the mayre, aldermen, and comynaltye of the cytye were assembled / where the sayd lordes shewyd an instrument or wrytynge, at the whyche hynge many labellys wyth sealys, as the kynges seale, syr Edwarde hys sonnes seale, wyth many other of the nobles of the lande, the whyche was the contente of the artycles whych were ordeyned and made at Oxenforde / wyllynge the mayre and aldermen (cūsyderynge the sayd actys were made to the honoure of god, fydelyte vnto the kynge, &amp; profyte of the realme) that they wold also in vpholdynge of the same, sette theyr common seale of the cytye. After which requeste thus to the mayre and the cytesyns made, after aduyse and counsayll amonge theym selfe taken / they desyred a sparyng of the lordes, tyll they myght speke wyth ye kyng and know his pleasure in that behafe. But fynally no sparynge at that tyme myghte be graunted / so that in the ende by the laboure that the lordes made, wyth helpe of suche solycytoures as they hadde wythin the cytye, the common seale was put to, and the mayre and dyuerse of the cytye sworne to maynteyne the same / theyr allegeaunce sauyd to the kyng wyth preseruacyon of the lybertyes and fraunchyses / and so departed.
                     Then daye by daye after the sayd douze Perys assemblyd at the newe temple in where they kept theyr counsaylys and courtes for the reformacyon of the olde greuys / and remoued from the kynge dyuerse of hys menyall of houselde, and sette in theyr places and offycys suche as lyked theym.
                     And vppon the .ix. daye of August / proclamacyon was made in dyuerse accustomyd places of the sayde cytye, that none of the kynges takers shulde take any thynge wythin the cytye wythout the wyll of the owner, excepte two tunne of wyne, whyche the kyng accustomably hadde of euery shyppe commynge from Burdeaux, payenge but .xl.s. for a tunne. By meane of whyche proclamacyon nothynge was taken by the kynges offycers, but yt were streyght payed fore wythin the cytye and lybertye of the same / whyche vsaunce contynued but a whyle.

The wyche is to meane the trauaylynge or the waye plees. For ye shall vnderstande that at those dayes they were kepte in dyuerse places of Englande, whyche nowe ben holden at westmynster / and iudgys ordeyned to kepe a cyrcuyte, as now they kepe the syzys in tyme of vacacyō. At this sayde courte these iudges ponyshed sore baylyes and other o

For the whych the sayd chefe iustyce prysoned them / and after sessyd them at greuous fynys. Also he somonyd the cytesyns of London to come vnto the sayde courte, for tollys that they hadde taken vppon the farther syde of the water. But yt was answered that the tollys that they there toke were takē lawfully, as they were redy to proue in places and court cō
                        uenyent to the same, whyche was wythin the precyncte of theyr lybertye. But not wythstandynge that answere, the sayde syr Hughe chargyd vppon queste .xii. knyghtes of Surey, to enquyre of that mater and other / the whych acquyted the sayde cytesyns, and shewyd that the sayde tolle belongyd to them of ryghte.

                     Then aboute the feaste of saynte Marke the kynge came to London from beyonde the see, and was lodgyd at the byshoppe of Londons paleys. After whose commynge by his assygnement, the erle of Glouceter was then lodged wythin the cytye, and syr Edwarde hys sonne was lodgyd in hys owne palays at westmynster. And soone after the kynge commaunded hym to be lodgyd at saynt Iohn̄s / and all the other lordes were lodgyd in other places wythoute the cytye. And the kyng of Romayns remoued agayne to westmynster. In whych tyme a direccyon was takē betwene the sayd ꝑtyes, &amp; a new assemble and parlyament assygned to be kept at westmynster in the quindena of saynt Iohn̄ Baptyst.

And vppon the sondaye folowyng, euery strypelynge of the age of .xii. yeres &amp; aboue, before hys alderman in hys warde was newly charged wyth the same othe. Then the dyspleasure betwene the kynge and hys Barons began to appere and dysclose, whyche longe whyle hadde ben kepte secret / in so myche that dyuers of theym assembled in the marches of walis, and gatheryd vnto them stronge power / and sent a letter vnto the kynge vnder the seale of syr Rogyer Clyfford, besechynge hym to haue in remembraunce the othe &amp; manyfolde promyse that he hadde made, for the obseruynge of the statutes made at his towne of Oxenforde, wyth other ordinaūces made to the honour of god, for fayth and allegeaūce to hys persone, and weale &amp; profyte of all hys realme / wyllyng hym farder to with stande and defye all suche persones, as wyll be agayne the sayde actes, sauynge the quene and her chyldern.
                     After the whyche letter thus sent, and receyuynge of yt none answere / the sayde Barons wyth banner dysplayed wēt agayn such as they knew yt helde agayne the sayd actys. And fyrste at Herforde they toke the bysshoppe of that see, and as many of hys chanōs as were allyaūtes born / and toke such treasour, and catell as

they there fande, and bare yt wyth theym. And after yode and sent vnto suche maners as the sayde byshoppe and chanons hadde, and them spoyled and robbed / and some of theym threw to the grounde and consumed wyth fyre / and put the sayde byshop and chanons in sure kepyng, and set other in theyr places / and after went vnto the other costes where they supposyd to fynde of theyr enymyes / kepynge theyr course toward London, berynge before them a banner of the kynges armys / &amp; so holdynge theyr iourney, myche people drewe vnto them. In the whyche progresse euer as they fande any that they knew to be agayne the mayntenaūce of ye sayd actes / they imprysoned thē &amp; spoyled theyr places, were they spyrytuall or temporall men. And in dyuers of the kynges castellys they set in such persones as to them lyked, and put out suche as there were set in by ye kyng / and gaue vnto theym an othe that they shulde be trew and faythfull to the kyng, and kepe those castelles to hys vse and weale of the realme.
                     About mydsomer when they drewe nere to London / they sent a letter vnto the mayre and aldermē, vnder the seale of syr Symonde Mountforde / wyllynge to know of theym whyther they wolde obserue the actys and statutes made in the parlyament of Oxenforde or not, or ellys they wolde ayde and assyste such persons as entendyd the breche of the same / &amp; sent vnto theym a copye of the sayd actes with a prouiso, that yf any that there were specyfyed were to the hurte of the realme or common weale of the same, that they then by dyscrete persones of the lande, shulde be alteryd and amendyd. The whych copye the mayre bare vnto the kynge then beyng at the towre, accompanyed with the quene and the kynge of Almayne whyche lately was retourned from beyonde the see, and syr Edward his son, wyth other of his counsayll.
                     Then the kynge entendynge to knowe the mynde of the cytye, axyd the mayre what he thoughte of those ordynaunces and actes / knowynge well that before hys commynge thyther, he hadde counsayled wyth the aldermen and some commons of the cytye. The mayre then abashed with that questyon / besought the kynge yt he myght comon wyth his bretherne the aldermen / and he shuld shew vnto hym his and theyr opinyons. But the kynge sayde he wolde here his aduyse wythout more counsayll. Then the mayre boldely sayde, that before tymes he wyth his bretherne and comynaltye of the cytye, by hys commaundement were sworne to maynteyne all actys made to the honoure of god, to the fayth of the kynge and profyte of the realme / whyche othe by hys lycence and moste gracyous fauour they entended to obserue and kepe. And more ouer to auoyde all occasion that might grow of grudge or varyaunce betwene his grace and his Barons wythin the cytye / they wolde auoyde all allyauntes &amp; straū
                        gers out therof, yf his grace were so contentyd. whych answere the kyng shewyd as he were therwyth pleasyd so that the mayre with his fauour departed, and sente answere to the barons to the same accordynge / theyr lybertyes alway vpholden and saued.
                     Then shortely after, for so myche as dyuerse noble men of the lande whyche helde agayne those statutes, were ryden towarde Douer, &amp; there entēdyd to haue taken shyppyng forfere of the barons / the kynge sent after them diuers persones of his housholde, and of the cytesyns of Lōdon, to refourme and enduce theym to retourne, and to tarye wyth the kyng.
                     
                        And in that season all allyauntes, the whych were taken suspecte of any fauour owynge to that one parte or to that other, were auoyded the cytye. But yt was not longe after that syr Edwarde the kynges sonne, sette them or many of them in offices with in the castell of wyndesore. Than watche was kepte dayly wythin the cytye / and in the nyghtes a certayne were assigned to ryde about ye town, wyth a certayn fotemen assygned to theym, to serche all the towne ouer. But of that insued harme. For while the rydyng watche was in one place of the cytye / some euyll dysposyd persones vnder colour of watche men, and to seche for straungers, robbed and spoyled many houses within the citye. For remedy wherof a standyng watche was ordeyned in euery ward. And the kynge herynge of the Barons nere commynge vnto the cytye / departed thens shortely after.
                     Then the Barons entryd the cytye the sonday before saynt Margarets daye. And shortely after the kynge returned to westmyster, with the quene and other of his counsayll. And soon after by the consent of the kynge and the Barons / syr Hughe le Spenser was made chefe iustyce and keper of the towre.
                     Uppon the morow folowynge Mary Magdaleyne daye, a wryt was directed vnto ye mayre and aldermen / chargynge them yt the kynges peace were fermely kepte wythin the citye. For in the same wryt yt was also expressyd, that the kynge and hys Barons were louyngly agreed. Farther more was by the sayd wryt cōmaundyd, that yf wythin the precyncte of theyr fraūches, were any persone or persones knowen, that wolde wythstande the foresayde ordynaunces &amp; statutes / that all such shulde be attached and put in pryson, and theyr goodes attached for the kynge tyll they knew his forther pleasure.
                     ye shall vnderstande that whyle ye lordes laye thus wythin the cytye / dyuerse conuenticulis and gaderyngis were made of the citesyns and other, that robbed in dyuerse places of the cytye, and dyd myche harme. The whyche was smally corrected / they were so borne oute and maynteyned by theyr maysters. And the commōs of the citye were farre oute of rule by insensyng of ryotouse ꝑsons / that in assembles and courtes that thē were kepte at Guyldhall or other places, symple and vndyscret persons shuld haue the voyce, and the worshypfull mē lytell or nothyng regarded / wherof ensuyd dayly myche vnhappynes and sorow, as after shall appere.
                     The Barons then to obteyne the more fauour of ye cytye / wyllyd them to shewe yf they hadde any of theyr libertyes wythdrawē, that they myght agayne to theym be restored / and also to dyuyse some new to theyr weale and profyte, and they wolde laboure to the kynge that they myghte haue theym graunted. For the whych comforte of the lordes, the mayre called the commons to the Guyldhall, and shewed to them the beneuolēce of the sayd lordes / &amp; willed them that euery of

                        ycer for hys offyce, to deuyse such thynges as myght be benefycyall for the cytye. wheruppon they counsaylled to gyther, and made a note in paper of dyuers statutes, prouysyons, and ordynaunces to be graunted / whyche myght more properly be named abhomynacyons.Singla
                              •
                            profyte. For they were deuysed to theyr synguler profyte, &amp; to ye great hurt of all other marchaū
                        tes commynge to the citye, and to all other fayres and markettes of Englande / and also preiudycyall to the vnyuersall weale of the realme. The whyche when they were ouersene by

the heddes of the cytye / yt was shewyd vnto the sayd cōmons, that theyr ordynaunces were not lefull nor charytable orderyd, and therfore they knewe well they shulde not be admytted / wyllyng thē to deuyse other. But all was in vayne. By meane wherof both those &amp; other that were ryght necessary for the cōmon weale of the cytye, were reiected &amp; put of.
                     Then ye Barons vpon the morowe folowynge saynt Iamys daye, departed from London towarde wyndesore, to se the gydynge of the castell. where at theyr commynge they putte out the foresayde allyauntes before set in by syr Edward the kinges son / the whyche assocyat wyth other yode vnto Fulham, where the kynge then lay / and shewyd to hym that the Barons had spoyled them of suche goodes as they hadde, and that wythout cause. But the kynge put them of for that season, and warned them to sue to hym agayne about Mychelmasse when more of his coūsayll was with hym / &amp; then they shuld haue iustyce.
                     Uppon the second daye folowyng the feaste of saynte Mathew, or the xxiii. daye of september / the kynge, the quene, with his sonnes and other nobles of thys land / toke shyppyng and sayled into Fraunce, to be present at the Frenche kynges parlyaament then holden at Bonony. And the morow after the octabis of saynt Mychaell, he landed agayne at Douer. And the frydaye folowynge he came vnto London.
                     And vppon the tuesday folowyng, passed a queste of .xii. knyghtes of Mydd sworne vpon a iury, betwene the abbot of westmynster and the cytye / for certayne pryuyleges that the cytesyns of London claymed wythin westmynster. where by the sayde iurye it was founden before Gylbert of Prestone then chefe Baron of the kynges excheker, that the s

                     About the quindena of saynt Mychaell / the fourmer complaynt of the allyauntes and other, whyche as aboue ye haue harde, was shewed before the kyng and ye lordes in the parlyament holden at westmynster. where lastely yt was sentencyd, that the Barons shulde restore all suche goodes as they and theyr companye hadde taken from all suche persons before that daye, as well to allyauntes as other both spyrytuall and temporall / and also that suche menyall seruauntes as shulde be dayly in the kynges house and about his person, shulde be suche as the kynge wolde chose and admyt hym selfe / the whyche ii. artycles the Barons vtterly denyed. wherfore the olde rancoure toke place / and dyssencyon kyndled his fyre of malyce agayn, betwen the kynge and his lordes feruently.

that yere Thomas fyz Thomas, and wythout counsayll of the aldermen sware at Guyldehall vppon the day of Symon and Iude / and made no presentement of hym vppon the morowe folowynge, nother to the kyng nor yet to the Barons of the kynges excheker, as they of ryght ought to haue done. For the whych presumpcyon the kynge was greuously dyscontentyd agayne the cytye. Soone after the kynge aduertysynge well yt the citye wolde take the Barons partye / and causyd syr Edwarde his son to take the castell of wyndesore by a trayne. wherof when he knewe that he was in possessyon / the kynge erly in a mornynge a lytell to fore Crystemas departed from westmynster, &amp; rode vnto the sayde castell / whyther shortely after came also many of the lordes that were vppon the kynges partye. And as faste the lordes and knyghtes whych helde wyth the erle of Leyceter, drew them toward Lonlon / so yt on eyther partye was mych people assembled. In the whyche passe tyme some well dysposyd, laboryd a concorde betwene the kynge &amp; hys lordes. By whose meanes fynally yt was agreed by bothe partyes, that all maters concernynge the fore sayde artycles of statutes and ordynaūces made at Oxenford, and after by the .xii. Perys / that the Frenche kynge shuld deme and iudge, whych shulde be holden and whyche not. And as he demyd / both partyes promysed assuredly to abyde. Upon whiche agrement copyes were made of the sayde statutes / and wyth letters shewynge the effecte of the fourmer agrement sent vnto the sayde kynge of Fraunce / then beynge saynt Lewys. And in the Crystmas weke folowynge / the kyng toke shyppynge with syr Edward his son and other of his counsayll / and sayled into Fraunce, for the foresayde cause. And for the partye of the sayd Barons, was sent ouer syr Peter de Mountforde and other. Then before Lewys kynge of Fraunce those statutes were sore argued vppon both parties. How be yt in the ende, the Frenche kynge callynge before hym both parties vpon the day before ye conuersyon of saynt Paule, or the .xxiiii. daye of Ianuary / syttynge in iudgement gaue expresse sentence that all and eueryche of the sayde statutes and ordynaunces, shulde be from ye daye foreward vtterly foredone and set at noughte / and all suche bandes and promyses that the kyng or any other had made for the mayntenaunce of the same, shulde be adnulled &amp; cancellyd / and the kynge and all other, for any mater concernynge those statutes set at lybertye. After whyche sentence thus gyuen the kynge retourned into Englande / so that he came to London the .xv. daye of Februarye. But the Barons beynge sore amoued wyth this sentence, &amp; notynge greate parcyaltye vnto the Frenche kynge / departed from London westwarde, &amp; so into the marchys of walys, where they drew to them great power, and warred vppon the landes and castellys of syr Roger Mortymer, &amp; threw some of them vnto the grounde, and spoyled of hys what they myghte fynde / and ouer that brent of hys manours and houses. In whose ayde syr Edwarde the kynges sonne commynge, hys people were dystressyd and he almoste taken. For redresse of whyche maters, a newe parlyamēt was appoynted to be holdē at Oxenforde in the quindena of Eester nexte folowynge, whyche came neuer to effecte. All be yt an other cronicle sayth that from this parlyament then holden at Oxenforde, the kynge and his lordes parted all dyscorded. Then

the barons drewe towarde London / &amp; the kynge remayned at woodstok. And then newe assuraunce by wrytynge endentyd was made betwene the comynaltye of the cytye and the Barons, wythoute consent of many of the rulers of the sayde cytye. wherfore the commons as men enraged made of theym self two capytaynes, whych they named constables of the cytye / yt is to say Thomas de Pyweldon &amp; Stephan Bukerel. At whose commaundement by tollynge of the great belle of Paules, all the cytye shulde be redy shortely in harnes, to gyue attendaunce vppon theyr sayd capytaynes.
                     About the begynnynge of lent / the constable of the towre, syr Hughe le Spenser, came wyth a fayre company of men of armys before hym into the cytye, and desyred assystence of the forenamed constables. The whyche commaunded the sayd belle to be

                        olowe theyr capytaynes, wythout knowlege what to do or whyther to go, folowed theyr sayde capytaynes / and so yode vnto Thystelworth vppon two myles beyonde westmynster, &amp; there spoyled the manour of the kynge of Romaynes, and sette yt after vppon a fyre. And that done, hys water mylles &amp; other commodities that he there had put theym to vtter ruyne. And after wyth great noyse and crye, returned vnto London.
                     This dede as sayth myne authour was cause of the mortall warre folowynge. For where before tyme the sayde kynge of Romaynes hadde ben for allyaunce that was betwene hym and the erle of Glouceter, a treatye of peace to be hadde betwene the kynge and his Barons / after that dede done he was enymy vnto them to the vttermoste of his power.

And for he harde that syr Peter de Moūt forde was at Northampton, gatherynge of people to strength the Barons partye / he spedde hym thyder, and wanne the towne vppon hym by force, and slewe many of hys men / and fynally toke hym &amp; syr Symon the son of the erle of Leyceter, wyth dyuers other on lyue / the which with many burgeyses of that towne that hadde take theyr partyes, the kynge sent vnto dyuers prysons / and some he closyd wythin the castell of ye same towne.
                     In thys passe tyme on Palmesondaye weke all the Iewes in London were spoyled and robbed / &amp; the nomber of .v. hūdred of them were slayn, and dyuers of theyr mansyons brent and destroyed / and suche as of them were saued, were conueyed for great mede vnto the towre / and there kept from the fury of the commons. wherof the occasyon was, for so myche as a Iewe wolde haue forced a crysten man to haue gyuē to hym more then ii.d. for the vsure of .xx.s. for a weke. For ye shall vnderstand that at those dayes, by lycence graunted vnto the Iewes of the kynge. they myght take by vsury of euery man yt of theym wolde borowe money .ii.d. of a poūd for a weke lendyng / and so of greter &amp; of smaller summes after that rate. And soon after the Iewes were thus punyshed / many houses of relygyon wythin ye citye and nere there about, were serched for goodes of alliaūtis / and myche founde. wherof a parte was brought vnto the lordis / but the more parte was stolen and brybed, In whyche season the kynge passed by diuers coūtreys / and lastely came

into Southsex with a strong power. wherof herynge the lordes made preparacyon to go towardes hym. In all whyche tyme the wardeyns of the v. portes kepte the see wyth shyppes, that no straungers shulde entre the lande to ayde the kynge agayne the Barons.
                     Then in the ende of Apryll the Barons wyth a multytude of the cytye, whyche they put in vawarde / departed from London, takyng theyr iourney towarde the kynge. And when they were well onwarde vpon theyre way / worde was brought vnto them that the kynge wyth an huge power was at Lewys.
                     wherfore they by an hole assent dyuysed a letter / and sent yt in ye name of all the Barons vnto the kynge, whose names here vnder folowe but not all.

                     And ouer this the kyng of Romaynes, syr Edwarde the kynges sonne, and the other lordes beyng thē with the kynge / sente vnto them a nother letter, wherof the tenour ensuyth.
                     
                        
                           RIcharde by the grace of god kynge of Romaynes alwaye Augustus, and Edwarde the noble fyrst begotten son of the kyng of England, all other Barons fermely standynge and abydynge wyth our souerayne lorde the kynge, to Symonde be Moūtford, Gylbert de Clare, and all other theyr false felowes. By the letters whych ye sent vnto the kynge our moste souerayne lorde; we vnder stande that we are defyed of you. Neuerthelesse this worde of dyffyaunce apperyd vnto vs suffycyently before, by the depredacyon and brennyng of our manours, and carienge away of our goodes. wherfore we wyll that ye vnderstande, that we defye you as our mortall &amp; publyke enmyes.

And where ye put vppon vs, that nother trewe nor good counsayll to our souerayne lorde the kynge we gyue / ye therin say falsely and vntrewly. And yf ye saieng ye syr Symonde de Mountforde and syr Gylbert de Clare wyll iustifye in the courte of our souerayne lord / we are redy to purchase to you suerty &amp; safe commynge, that there we may proue our trew and faythfull innocencye, &amp; your false and traytorouse lyenge. wytnessyd wyth ye seales of Rychard kynge of Romaynes, &amp; syr Edwarde forenamed. Gyuen at Lewys the .xii. daye of May.
                        
                     
                     WHen the Baronys had receyued these letters from the kyng and his lordes / they perceyued well that there was none other mean, but defēde theyr cause by dynt of sword. wherfore they puttyng theyr trust in god / spedde theym forth toward the kynge. And vppon a wednysday beynge then the .xxiiii. daye of May, erly in the mornynge both hostes met. where after the Lōdoners had gyuen the fyrst assaute, they were betyn backe / so that they began to draw from the sharpe shot and strokes, to the discomforte of the Barons hoste. But ye Barons encoraged and comforted theyr men in suche wyse, that not alonely the freshe and lusty knyghtes fought egerly, but also suche as before were scomfyted, recoueryd theyr vertue &amp; strength, &amp; fought wythout fere, in so myche that the kynges vaward lost theyr places.Cruell and detestable Batayle. Then was the felde coueryd wyth dede bodyes / &amp; gaspynge &amp; gronyng was hard on euery syde. For eyther was desyrous for to bryng the other out of life. And the fader sparyd not the son, nor the son yt fader. Allyaūce at ye tyme was turned vnto dyffyaunce / and crysten blood that daye was shad wythoute pytie. Thus duryng the cruell fyght by the more parte of ye day, lastely the victory fyll to the Barons / so yt there was taken the kynge, &amp; the kynge of Romayns, syr Edwarde the kynges

son, wyth many other noble men to the nomber of .xxv. Barons and Banerettes / &amp; people slayn a great multytude ouer .xx. thousande as sayth myne authours.
                     when the Barons had thus obteyned vyctorye, prouysyon was made for ye saufe kepyng of the prysoners / so that all were sent vnto dyuers castellys and prysons, except the kyng, his brother the kynge of Almayne, &amp; syr Edwarde his son / the whych the Barons helde wyth theym tyll they came to London.
                     Then a new graunte was made by the kynge, that the foresayd statutes shuld stande in strength. And yf any were thought vnreasonable / they to be corrected and amendyd by foure noble men of the realme / that is to meane .ii. of the spyrytualtye, and .ii. of the temporaltye. And yf those .iiii. myght not agree / that then the erle of Angeou and duke of Burgoyn to be iudges of that mater. And this to be fermely holden and obeyed by the kynge and hys brother / the kynges graunted that theyr sonnes &amp; heyres shuld remayne wyth the Barons as prysoners, tyll all thynge were fynysshed accordynge to the former agrement. And vppon thys was a parlyament appoynted, to be holden at London at Penthecoste folowynge / but that came neuer to purpose. Thē the tuesday before the Assencyon day peace was proclaimed in London betwene the kynge and hys Barons. And vppon the daye folowynge, the kynge &amp; the Barons came vnto London / with the kynge of Romayns, &amp; syr Edwarde the kynge sonne. Then syr Edward as pledge for the kyng, and syr Henry sonne vnto the kynge of Almayn were sent vnto the toure, and there lodged / and from thēs vnto Douer castell. And the kyng was lodged in the byshoppes palays by Paules / and the kynge of Almayne with dyuers other within the towre. Then yt was agreed by the kynge, that for his more suertye, and for the weale of the lande / that the erle of Leyceter shuld be ressyaūt in the kynges courte. Uppon the whyche agrement &amp; other, many of the prysoners were set at large.
                     In this passe tyme before the felde of Lewys / ye quene &amp; the kyng of Romayns had sent ouer ye see for souldy ours, to ayde the kynge agayne the Barons / whych now were comen in great nomber vnto Douer, &amp; there houed in ye see to haue lāded. wherof herynge the Barons sent the kyng of Romayns to the castell of Berkham stede as prisoner, tyll the sayde allyauntes were retourned / and caused kynge Henry wyth a great power to ryde thyder, and force the sayde hoste of straungers to retourne into theyr owne countreys.
                     And when the kynge had returned the sayde straungers / he shortly after wyth agrement of the barons sayled ouer into Fraunce, and retourned agayne wythin short terme.

                     IN this .xlviii. yere / the lordes of the marches about the feast of Crystmasse, assembled theym in those costes, and dyd myche harme vppon the lordeshyppes and manours of the erlys of Leyceter and of Glouceter standynge in the marches of walys. wherfore the kynge

rode shortely after to Glouceter, and called there a counsayl of his lordes. By authoryte of whych counsayll yt was enacted, that as many of ye sayd lordes as came not in by the octauis of saynte Hyllary nexte folowynge, &amp; yelded them vnto the kynges grace, shuld be exyled. And by the sayd coū
                        sayll was also agreed, that in ye sayd octaues shulde a parlyament be holdyn at westmynster. At whyche daye the kyng wyth his lordes spyrytuall and temporall and commons of hys lande, beganne his forsayde parlyament. Durynge the whyche yt was there shewed the kynge beynge present, that he nor syr Edward his son nor none of theym, shulde after that daye greue or cause to be greuyd, the erles of Leyceter and of Glouceter, ye Barons, Banerettes or knyghtes, the citesyns of London and Barons of the .v. portes / nor none other ꝑsons or persones of hyghe or low degree, that was vpon the partye of the sayd erles, for any mater of dyspleasure done agayne the kynge and the sayd syr Edwarde his sonne, at any tyme before that day. And that to vphold / the kynge before hys lordes was sworne. And after that was shewed and rad a charter of pardon concernynge the sayde cause / and a confyrmacyon of the statutes of the foreste, wyth many other actes and statutes before graunted of the kynge. Then in the feaste of saynt Gregory folowynge, or the .xii. daye of Marche / syr Edwarde the kynges son, yt beforne was also sworn to performe such promyses as the kyng had made before in the parliament, was delyueryd at lyberte / &amp; also syr Henry the kynges son of Almayne, the whych had ben kept as pledge as ye before haue harde vppon the terme of .ix. monethes &amp; odde dayes / vpon assuraūce made, that ye sayd syr Edwarde shuld dwel and abyde in the kynges courte, and not to departe from thens wythoute lycence of the kyng and of a certayne of the Barons. After this many instrumentes &amp; bandes were made by the kynge and syr Edwarde his son, for the performaunce of couenaunts &amp; paccyons made betwene the kynge and the Barons, whyche shortly after came to small effecte.
                     In the season betwene Easter and Penthecoste, for orderynge of the aforesaid statutes made at Oxenford, fell deffencyon betwene the erles of Leyceter &amp; of Glouceter / so that wordes of dyspleasure was vtteryd betweene them, the kynge and they also beynge then at Glouceter. Then the kynge and his Barons had laboure to set theym at vnyte and reste.
                     And vppon the see the Barons of the .v. portes robbed and spoyled all men that they myght take / sparynge nother Englyshe marchauntes nor other. Of whych prayes as ye cōmon fame then went, some of the Barons of the lande hadde good parte.
                     In the whytson weke folowynge, ye kynge wyth the erle of Leyceter, and syr Edwarde hys sonne, wyth many other lordes beynge at Herforde in ye edge of walys / the sayd syr Edward secretly and wythout lycence departed from the courte, and yode vnto Chester / where he accōpanyed to him the erle of Glouceter and ye lordes of the Marches, the erle of warēne, syr Roger Mortymer and other / &amp; from thens went vnto Glouceter, breking the brydges as he went, to the entent that he were not folowed tyll he had assembled his power.
                     when knowlege of thys came vnto the erle of Leyceter / he in al hast sent vnto syr Symōde his son, yt he shuld gather his knyghtes vnto hym. The which accordyng to ye cōmaundemēt assembled vnto hym myche people, &amp;

with them drew toward wynchester / so that he came before the cytye vppon the euyn of the translacyon of saynte Swythyn, or the .xiiii. daye of the moneth of Iulye. where he was shyt out, for so mych as the cytesyns knewe not whyther he came as the kynges frende or not. And also lytell before they hadde receyued a letter from syr Edwarde, wyllynge theym to holde theym out of the cytye. For these causes the citesyns closed theyr gates agayn the sayd syr Symonde and hys companye. But yt was not longe or the cytye was yelden. Then they spoyled the town / and slewe the more partye of the Iewes that dwellyd wythin the same. And that done, layd syege vnto the castell and assauted it. But for tydynges were fayned of the cōmynge of syr Edwarde with hys power / they departyd shortely thens, and so yode vnto Kenelworth.
                     Uppon the laste daye of Iuly / syr Edwarde wyth hys hoste came vnto Kenelworth foresaid, and fyll sodaynly vppon the hoste of the forenamed syr Symonde, and wyth shedynge of lytell blood, toke there prysoners the erle of Oxenforde, wyllyam de mount Canyse, Adam de Newmarket, syr Balwyne wake, and Hughe Neuyle, wyth dyuers other / and syr Symonde fledde into the castell and so escaped. Then these forenamed prysoners were all sent vnto Glouceter / and there putte in suer kepynge.
                     In this meane whyle syr Symonde erle of Leyceter, toke leue of the kynge / whyche then from Herforde passed the ryuer of Seuerne, and so yode vnto worceter. And ye erle with great payne passed the brydges before by syr Edwarde broken, and passed the coūtreys in gaderynge of people as he went / so yt in processe he had wyth hym stronge power. wherof herynge syr Edwarde, costed towarde hym / and the .vi. daye of August met wyth hym at Euysham in worceter shyre / where betwene theym was foughten a cruell fyght. In yt whych at length was slayn the sayd syr Symonde, and syr Henry his sonne and heyre, syr Hughele Spenser, syr Peter de Mountforde, and many other noble men that helde vppon the Barons partye.
                     After whych scomfyture, some malycyous dysposed persons, in despyte of the erle cut of his hode &amp; his dimyssaryes, and fastyned them vppon eyther syde of hys nose / and after made a present therof vnto the wyfe of syr Roger Mortymer. Hys fete also and his handes were cut from the body, and sente to sondry places / and the trunke of hys bodye buryed wythin the chyrch of Euysham. Of this erle speketh Ranulphe mūke of Chester in his boke of Policronycon, and calleth hym Symon the ryght wise / sayynge that god wrought for hym myracles after his deth, the whyche forfere of the kynge and syr Edwarde his sonne were kept close and secret, so that no man durste speke of them. Soone after this victory thus obteyned by syr Edward, ye kyng &amp; he met / by whose authorytyes all prysoners thē which were in hold in dyuers places, by y• cōmaundemēt of ye sayd syr Edward, were set at lybertie / &amp; many other dayly accused &amp; set in for them. And about the natyuyte of our lady, a parliamēt was holdē at winchester where by authoryte of ye same, all statutes &amp; ordinaūces before made by ye Barons at Oxenforde in the .xli. yere of ye kyng, were vtterly fordone &amp; set at nought / and all bondes &amp; wrytynges made by the kyng or any other for the obseruynge of the same, were cancellyd and broken. Also at thys coūsayll was ordeyned, that all such as had fauoured the Barons, were

they in pryson or at large / shulde be disherited. And then ye kyng resumed into his hande, all grauntes before made and gyuen to any person. And for syr Symounde de Mountforde myght not agree wyth the kynge at the parlyament / he was restored to the castel of Kenelworth, as he before was assured / the whyche he wyth syr Henry de Hastynges and other kept longe after.
                     when the parlyament was ended / the kyng came vnto wyndesore with a great power, entendynge as the fame then went to destroye the cytye of London, for the great ire and dyspleasure that he hadde vnto yt. wherof heryng the mayre and aldermen, were striken in a wonderfull fere / all be yt many of the rabbysh and wylde cōmoners, were in full purpose to haue defended the cytye agayne the kynge. And thus amonge them were dyuers and many opinyons. And no wonder / for at those dayes the cytye was inhabyted with many maner of nacyons, whyche then were admytted for cytesyns.
                     LAstely by grace and sad counsayll of the beste of the cytye / they condescended to make a supplycacyon to ye kynge, &amp; send yt by some religyous person. Of the which they made dyuers, and sent them by sondry persones / but all auayled ryght nought. For the kynge was so greuously encensyd by some of his counsayll agayne the cytesyns, yt he wold not loke vppon none of theyr supplycacyons. And yf any man spake / for theym / he soone wold make such coū
                        tenaunce, that men whyche were in his fauoure feryd to speke for them. Then the cytesyns were counsayled by theyr frēdes, yt they shuld make a writyng, and seale yt with theyr common seale / by vertue whereof they shulde offer theym selfe to put theym holly in the kynges grace and mercy touchynge theyr lyues &amp; goodes. Accordynge to the whyche counsayll they deuysed a wrytynge, and sealed yt wyth theyr cōmon seale / and that done chose .viii. persons of the cytye such as had frēdes in the courte, and sent them toward wyndesore the .vi. daye of October. Uppon whych day they encountered beyonde Colbroke a knyght of the kinges callyd syr Roger Leyborne, the whych turned the sayde .viii. persones vnto the cytye / and he also rode wyth theym tyll he came nere vnto the cytye, and there departed from them, and rode vppon the backe syde of the towne vnto the toure. But at his departynge he wyl led them to warne the mayre wyth a certayne of the cytye, to mete wyth hym vppon the morow at Berkynge chyrche, whyche standeth nere vnto the towre. Uppon the morow when the mayre and the sayde syr Roger were met / he after a longe processe made, shewed to them of the kynges greuous displeasure whyche he bare towarde the cytye / and the meanes that hadde be vsed by theyr frendes and louers, to obteyne grace for the cytye. Lastely he expressed yt no grace for them myght be had / excepte they wolde by theyr common seale bynde theym selfe fully and holly to stande at ye kynges grace, and to put in his mercy theyr lyues and goodes. wherunto in the ende the cytesyns graunted, and delyueryd the forsayde wrytynge vnto the foresayd Roger / prayenge hym to be good meane for them to ye kynge. The whych departyd towarde ye kyng vpon the morow, and returned agayne the .vi. daye after / and wylled the mayre and aldermen to mete wyth hym agayne at the foresayd chirch. where he shewyd to them that the kynge by great instaunce of

theyr frendes hadde receyued theyr wyrtynge / and wold fyrste for the begynnynge of cōtentacion of his mynde, that all the chaynes / whych stode in euery strete and lanes ende wythin the cytye, shuld be lousyd frō theyr postes, and the post also drawen out of the erthe, and all to be brought vnto the towre / and that done, that the mayre wyth a certayne of ye cytesyns to the nomber of .xl. persones, shuld the daye folowynge be at wyndesore to comferme the graunt of theyr wrytyng. And yt they shuld go &amp; come in safe &amp; suer wise / he delyuered to them the kynges letter &amp; seale for ye terme of foure dayes. whyche all was done accordynge to theyr former deuyse / and the mayre wyth the foresayd persones was redy at wyndesore vppon the morow beynge sondaye by one of the clocke / and there taryed tyll .iiii. of the same daye. At whyche season the kynge commynge from his dysporte, entred the castell wythout contenaunce or castyng his eyen vppon the Londoners. And when the kyng and his peole was entred the castell / the Londoners wolde haue folowed. But they were warned to abide with out. Then short tyme after the kyng causyd a proclamacyon to be made, that no man of hygh or low degre, to the Londoners shulde make any sayynges of dyspleasure, or make to thē any quarell. And in the euenynge came vnto them the foresayd syr Roger &amp; syr Robert waleys knyghtes, and brought theym into the castell / and sayde the kynges pleasure was not to speke wyth them that nyght. And after the sayde knyghtes delyueryd them vnto the cōstable of ye castell / which closyd them all in a large toure, where that nyght they hadde small chere and worse lodgynge.
                     Then vppon the morowe beynge mondaye towarde nyght / they were taken oute of that toure, and delyueryd vnto ye baylly of the sayd castell, and lodged by his assygnement / except .v. persons, that is to mene Thomas fyz Thomas then mayre, Mychaell Tony, Stephan Bukkerell, Thomas Pywellyson, and Iohn̄ de Flete. The whyche .v. persones the kynge hadde gyuen to syr Edwarde his sonne / at whose commaundemēt they remayned styll in the saide toure longe after, not wythstandynge the kynges saue conduyte to theym as before is shewed, made. when tydynges hereof came vnto the cyte of London / all be yt that for fere many before were auoyded, then there auoyded many mo / &amp; conueyed theyr goodes in secrete wyse, into dyuers countreys of Englande, so that many of them neuer returned after.

                     IN thys .xlix. yere, vppon the daye of saynt Leonarde or the vi. daye of Nouember / ye kyng came vnto westmynster. And shortly after he gaue vnto diuers of his houshold seruaūtes, vpon thre score houses &amp; housholdes wythin the citye / so yt the owners were compellyd to agre and redeme theyr houses and housholde wyth all goodes as in them were, or ellys to auoyde, and suffer such persons to enter as ye sayd houses were gyuē vnto / &amp; not alonely that, but also all suche landes and tenementes,

goodes &amp; catalles, as the sayde cytezeyns had in any other places of Englande. And than he made custos or gardeyn of the cytye, syr Othon constable of the toure / whych syr Othon chase to be bayllyues vnder hym, and to be to hym accomptable to the vse of the kyng, Iohn̄ Adrian, &amp; walter Heruy cytezeyns of the same cytye. And after thys the kynge toke pledges of the best mēnes sonnes of the cytye, that hys peas shulde be surely kepte within the same. The whiche were put in the toure of Londō, and there kepte at the coste of theyr parentes. And shortly after by great laboure &amp; suyte made / all the forsayd persones which were in the kepynge of ye bayly of the castell of wyndesore iiii. onely except, that is to saye Rycharde Bonauenture, Symō de Hadisstok, wyllyam de Kent, &amp; wyllyam de Grouceter / all the other Lōdoners xxxiili s

                         nōber, were delyuered &amp; came to erondon the Thursday folowynge the feast of saynte Luke, in ye xxi. day of Nouember / &amp; the other .ix. were kepte styll in the toure of wyndesore.
                     Then dayly suyte &amp; laboure was made vnto ye kynge to haue hys gracyous fauour / and to know hys pleasure what fyne he wolde haue of the cytye, for theyr transgressyons &amp; displeasure by theym to hym done. For the whyche the kynge asked .xl.M.li and fermely helde hym at .l.M. marke. But the cytye layde for them that the poore commons of the cytye, whereof many were auoyded were the trespassours / and ouer that the best men of the cytye by these ryotous ꝑsones, were spoyled and robbed / and by the rouers also of the see, as the wardeynes of yt .v. portes and other, in thys troublous seasō they had lost a great part of theyr substance. For the whych cōsyderacyons and many other whyche were tedyous to wryt the cytezeyns besought the kynge of hys most gracious fauour and pyte, and to take of theym as they myght bere.
                     Thys matter thus hangyng / the kynge vppon seynt Nycholas euyn departed from westmynster towarde Northampton. And lytell before hys departynge / ordeyned syr Iohn̄ lynd knyght and mayster Iohn̄ waldren clerke, to be gardeynes of the cytye &amp; toure / the whyche were named in the kynges writtynge Senesshalles or stewardes of the cytye. Uppon the daye folowynge that the kynge was ryden / these .ii. forenamed stewardes sent for .xxiiii. of the mooste notable men of the cytye, and warned theym to apere the day folowynge before ye kynges counsayle at westmynster / where at theyr apparaunce was shewed vnto them by syr Roger Leyborne, that the kynges mynde was, that they shulde haue the rule of the cytye in hys absens vnder the foresaid Senesshalles &amp; for to se good rule kept wythin ye cytye / they shuld be sworne there before hys counsayle.
                     The which there were then sworn &amp; countermaunded vnto the cytye. And alwaye labour was made vnto the kynge for the fyne of the cytye / so that in the Crystmas weke an ende was made wyth the kyng, by labour of suche frendes as the cytye had about hym, for the summe of .xx.M. marke, for all transgressyons and offences by them before done / certayne persones excepted whyche the kynge had gyuē to syr Edwarde hys sonne, beynge as before is sayde in the tour of wynsore. For the paymēt of which summe at dayes by agremēt set / syr Roger Leyborne &amp; mayster Roberte wareyn clerke, were assigned to take the suertyes for ye same. After whych suertye by theym receyued, and sente

vnto the kynge to Northamptō / the kynge sent immedyatly after vnto ye cytezeyns, a charter vnder his brode seale, whereof the effecte ensueth.
                     HEnry by the grace of god, kīg of Englande, lord of Irlande and duke of Guyan / to al men helth. Knowe ye that for the fyne of .xx.M. marke, the whyche our cytezeyns of London to vs made, for the redempcyon of the transgressions and trespaces to vs, to our quene, to our noble brother Rycharde kynge of Almayne, and to Edward our fyrst begotē sonne done / we remytte and pardone for vs and for our heyres to the sayd cytezeyns and theyre heyres, as moche as in vs is / so that they haue and enioye all theyre former grauntes and lybertees, rentes and profittes, from the feste of Crystmas laste paste / and also that the sayde cytezeyns haue to theym all forfaytes of all malefactours of ye cytye, which in the parturbaūce before made were endyted, or for the same be yet for to be endyted / Excepte the goodes and catalles of theym, of the whyche we haue gyuen the bodyes vnto our forsayd sonne Edwarde / and except the rentes and tenemētes of all those cytezeyns, whyche now be and shalbe our eschete by reason of the forsayde transgressyons. And that all prysoners whyche now in our prysons remayne, be freely delyuered / excepte those ꝑsones whose bodyes we haue gyuē to Edwarde our sonne. And yt the sayd cytezeyns be as fre as they before the sayd transgressyons were, in all partes and costes of thys our landes. In wytnes whereof we haue made these letters patentes / wytnesseth my selfe at Northampton, the .x. day of Ianuarii, the yere of our reygne .xlix.
                     After whyche pardone by the cytezeyns receyued / all pledges for them beyng in the toure of Londō, And also .iiii. of them that were in the toure of wyndesore, that is to say Rychard Bonauenture, Symō de Hadistoke, wyllyam of Kente, and wyllyam of Glouceter, were delyuered. Thanne also was dyscharged the forenamed stewardes syr Iohn̄ Lynde &amp; mayster Iohn̄ waldrē / and the cytezeyns of them selfe chose for mayre wyllyā Fyz Rychard, and for shyreffes Thomas de la fourde, &amp; Gregory de Rokkysley. Than for leuyng of this fyne were set as well seruauntes couenāt men, as housholders / &amp; many refuced the lyberties of the cytye for to be quyt of that charge.
                     whyle the kynge lay thus at Northampton / syr Symō de Mountford put hym vpon the dome of the Popes legat Octobonus, yt before was come into thys lāde to refourme thinges in the chyrche of Englande, and also to set vnyte &amp; reste betwene the kynge and hys lordes. To whose do me, &amp; also of the kynge of romayns, the forsayde syr Symond had bounden hym to stande. Upon whych promyse and bande, he was lybertied to be at large in the kynges courte, and so contynued a season. But in ye ende when the kyng was commē into Lō
                        don, he departed sodaynly out of the courte &amp; rode vnto wynchelsee, where he accompanyed hym with the rouers of the see / and after some pryses taken, departed from theym and so sayled into Fraunce, and put hym in seruyce with holy Lowis than kyng of that prouynce.
                     Thys yere also vppon the euyn of saynt Iohn̄ baptyst / the kynge begā hys syege about the castell of Kenelworth with a mighty power. But syr Hēry Hastynges, with suche as were within it, defended it so strōgly, that the kynge and all hys power myght

nat wynne the sayde castell of a lōge tyme, as after in the nexte yere shall appere.
                     It is before shewed, howe ye quene by her purueiaūs had caused an host of straungers to prepare them to come into Englande, for to ayde her lorde the kynge agayn the barons: She had also purchased a curse of ye Pope, to acurse all the sayde barons and all theyre ayders &amp; helpers / and had commyssiōs dyrected to certayn bysshoppes of Englande, to execute the same / as of London, and of wynchester, and of Chychester / the which for fere of the barons than denyed &amp; deferred the execucyon and sentence of the sayd curse. wherfore the quene made newe laboure to the pope than Urban the .iiii. and had it graū
                        ted, that the sayde Bysshoppes for theyr dysobedyence shulde be corrected. And for thys, Octobon the foresayde legate, thys yere at a counsayl holden by hym and the clergy of Englande at Paules chyrche in Londō suspended the sayde Bysshoppes, &amp; theym sente vnto Rome to be assoyled of the pope, beynge at thys daye Clement the .iiii.

And natwithstandynge the greate harmys they had done by rouyng vppon the see, aswel to Englysshe marchauntes as to other / they had to them confermed all theyr fourmer pryuyleges.

But what the cause was of thys ende thus made atwene ye kyng &amp; thē it is nat shewed. But ye cōmon fame at yt day ran yt the sayd wardeins of ye v. portes had at thys day ye dominiō of the see. wherfore ye kyng was fayn to folowe theyr pleasures.
                     About the feast of Philip &amp; Iacob ye kyng helde hys parlyamēt at Nort hāpton.

                     IN thys .lii. yere, for what hap is nat expressed, syr Gylbert de Clare erle of Gloceter refused ye king and in the marche of walys gadered vnto hī a stronge power. To whome also drewe syr Iohn̄ Eyuile &amp; other of the company disherited. And after the feest of Crystmasse, with a greate hoost came nere vnto London / that tyme the Popes legate Octobonus beynge lodged at the toure of Lōdō.
                     whan the mayre and aldermen of the cytye were ware of the erles commynge, with so stronge a power, nat knowynge whether he were the kynges frende or nat / shytte the gates agayne hys fore ryders. And for the kynge nor none of hys coūsayll was than nere vnto the cytye / the mayre and aldermen went vnto the legate,

and requyred hys counsayl, whether they shulde suffre the erle to entre īto the cytye or nat / wherunto the legate answered that he thought nat the contrary / for he knewe wele that he was the kynges trewe subyect &amp; frē
                        de. It was nat lōge after that a messanger came from the erle vnto the mayre, wyllynge to haue lycence to passe thorugh the cytye into Southwerke, where he entendyd to lodge hym and hys people / whyche was graunted / and so the erle passed thorough the cytye, and was lodged in South werke. To whō came shortly after by Southerey, syde syr Iohn̄ Eyuile with a greate company.
                     Than the mayre kepte the gate of ye brydge shyt, and watched it dayly with a certayne of armyd men, and euery nyght caused the draw brydge to be drawen, &amp; the waters syde dayly and nyghtly to be watched with many armyd men. In lytell processe of tyme after / the legate and the erle agreed in suche wyse, that the erle by hys aduyce was suffered with a certayne of hys people to be lodged within ye cytye. By reason wherof he dayly drewe more &amp; more of hys people into the cytye / so that fynally many thynges were ordered by hym, &amp; many of the commons toke hys partye agayne the mayre and aldermen.
                     Then in the Easter weke he toke ye keyes of the brydge and of the gates from the offycers of the cytye, and delyuered them to such as pleased hym and receyued into the cytye many of the dysherited persones, and gaue to them fre lybertye to passe the brydge by all houres of the daye &amp; ye nyghte. The mayre of all thys sente worde vnto the kynge, whych than was gaderyng of hys power in Northfolke, and made hasty spede towarde London. In whyche meane tyme the erle with hys company made bulwerkes and barbycanys atwene the toure &amp; the cytye, and caste dykes &amp; trenches in some places of ye cytye, &amp; fortyfyed it wonderously.
                     Then many of ye cytezeyns feryng a newe insurreccyon, voyded the cytye as secretly as they myght / whose goodes the erle seased to hys owne vse: or suffred hys men to spoyle thē at theyr pleasure. Than the commōs of the cytye forgat theyr late punysshment / and as men without drede of god or of theyr kynge, toke certayne of the aldermen &amp; caste theym in prysone, and sequestred theyr goodes, &amp; dyspoyled moche therof. And thervppon ranne to the Guyldhalle, and there chose for theyr mayre or for custos or ruler of the cytye syr Rychard de Culworth knyght, and for baylyues Roberte de Lynton and Roger Marshall / and dyscharged the olde mayre and sheryffes. And that done, all suche prysoners as were in Newgate, Ludgate, and Crepylgate, or in any other prysons within the cytie for bycause of the barons warre before passed / they were delyuered &amp; set at lybertye.
                     whan the legate beheld all thys rebelliō and dyscorde / he repented hym of hys fourmer counsayll gyuē vnto the mayre. And for he sawe he might nat refourme the erle of hys errour / he thretened hym wyth the censurs of the chyrch, and to accurse hym as the dysheryted were. And vpon thys he commaunded the deuyne seruyce to be sayd without note, &amp; the chyrch dores to be shytte in tyme of the seruice doynge, &amp; that no belle were ronge vnto the sayde seruyce / and all to the entent yt the disheryted, whych stode accursed shuld nat entre ye churches to here the deuyne seruyce of god.
                     Then vpō .iii. wekes after Easter / the kynge came to Ham̄ .iii. myles from London, and was lodged hym

selfe in the abbaye of whyte monkes of Stratforde. whyther came vnto hym the legate soone after, and was lodgid also in the same abbay / where for streyghtnes of lodgyng his horse and mules were sette wythin the closter of the sayde abbay. Then the kynges hoste made dayly assautes vpon the cytye / and gunnes and other ordynaunces was shot into the cytye, whyche lytell or nothynge hurte the towne, yt was so strongly fortyfyed.
                     In this season ye legate vpon his partye, and the kynge of Romaynes vppon the other partye, for allyaūce that was betwene hym and the erle of Glouceter / labored so to the kyng that a reformacyon of peace was spoken of. Durynge whyche treaty the souldyours lyenge in Southwerke, made many robboryes in Southery and other places / and rowed ouer to westmynster, and spoyled there the kynges paleys, and deuoured hys wyne, and brake ye glasse of the wyndowes / and all other necessaryes to that paleys they destroyed &amp; wasted / and somtymes came in lyke wyse into Lōdon and robbyd there also. Of whyche there was taken .iiii. yt bare the Conysaunce of the erle of Derby / the whyche the erle caused theyr handes and legges to be bounden, and then put into a sacke, and so cast into the Thamys.
                     About the feast of saynt Barnabe / the peace betwene the kynge and the erle of Glouceter was concludyd.
                     After the whyche conclusyon taken / the erle remouyd out of the cytye, &amp; was lodged agayne in South werke. And the kyng entryd the citye the sondaye before mydsomer daye. And forth wyth the kynges proclamacyons were made through the cytye, of the peace betwene the kyng &amp; the erle. And after was gyuen liberte to ye dysheryted persons yt they shuld haue .xi. dayes respyte to shyft for them selfe / that is to meane other to auoyde to suche places where they myght be in some suertye, or ellys to agre to the former composycyon made by the legate, and to paye the .v. parte of the slynte of theyr landes / certayne persones to be exceptyd, as before is rehersyd. And as touchyng to the erle and suche other as before were not dysheryted, wyth also the cytesyns of London, to be clerely forgyuen and pardoned.
                     And then was restoryd to theyr offyces Aleyn Sowch for mayre, and Thomas Basynge and Robert de Cornehyll for shyreffes. And the aldermen whych before were deposyd, were agayn restored to theyr wardes and offyces.
                     Uppon the wednysday folowynge, the legate interdyted all the cytye. which endured from .vi. of the clocke in the mornyng, tyll .iii. of the clocke the next day at after none / and then yt dyschargyd, vppon the othe of .ii. commons sworne in the name of all the cytye, that the cytye shulde stande to the ordynaunce and iudgement of holy chyrche. But an other cronycle sayth, that this interdyccyon shulde haue contynued longer, ne had ben the sterenesse of the Londoners / whyche helde the legate so streyght, that they enforced hym to wythdraw that sentence vppon the foresayde condycyon. Then after this, all the bulwerkes and barbycans made by the erle in the cytye were plucked clene vppe / and the dyches fyllyd, that no parte of theym was sene. when the cytesyns shulde haue theyr newe pardon graūted / an obstacle was made, for so myche as they as yet hadde not recompensyd the kynge of Romaynes for the subuersyon of his manour of Thystylworth. For the whyche was axed .vi. thousande marke / 

so that fynally wyth great laboure and frendshyppe, thy agreed to gyue vnto hym for amendes a thousande marke, to be payed in two yeres.
                     It was longe after the kynge acceptyd to his grace syr Iohn̄ Eyuyle, syr Nycholas de Segraue, syr willyam Marmeryn or Mermyon, syr Richarde Gray, syr Iohn̄ fyz Iohn̄, and syr Gylbert de Lucy, with other. And accorde was also made betwene syr Edwarde the kynges sonne, and the forenamed erle of Glouceter. And then was all fortresses and other defences which before tyme were made in Southwerke and in other places ioynynge to the same, pulled vp and destroyed / and the erle and all other souldyours clene voyded. And after all thynges set in order and reste, excepte such as yet kept the yle of Ely / the kynge rode to Shrowysburye, where he taried a season, for to cōmon of maters betwene hym and Lewelyn prynce of walys.

For suertie wherof ye sayde erle shuld delyuer into the kynges possessyon his castell of Henleger standynge vppon ye marche of walis. But this cam after to no purpose, wherfore ye cause

is not shewyd. But ye iourney was perfourmed by syr Edwarde the kynges sonne, as after shall be to you declared. In this passe tyme the cytesyns of London contentyd so well syr Edwardes mynde, that he laboured so for them to the kynges grace, that they had then theyr chartour so cōfermyd, that they shuld after theyr auncyent lybertyes chose of them self a mayre and two shryues / and ye sayd shryues to haue the offyces therunto belongynge to ferme, as they to fore hadde / excepte that wheretofore they payde for the fee ferme .iii. hundred and l. punde, nowe they shulde pay .iiii. hundred and .l. poūde. After whyche confyrmacyon thus graūted and passed by ye kynges brode seale / the cytesyns vppon the .xiiii. daye of Iuly assembled at the Guyldhall, &amp; chase for theyr mayre Iohn̄ Adryan draper / and for shyreffes walter Porter and Iohn̄ Tayller. And vppon ye xvi. daye folowynge syr Edwarde beynge present, presented them vnto ye king at westminster / where they were admitted &amp; sworne. And then was syr Hugh of Othon dyschargyd of that rule of the cytye.
                     Then the citesyns of theyr fre wyll gaue vnto the kynge an .C. marke / &amp; to syr Edwarde .v. hūdred marke / whyche gyft the kyng well accepted.

And for that holy Lewys then kyng of Fraunce was gone, he taryed at Burdeaux a certayne season / and after sped hym with his forsayd company toward ye cytye of Thunys, where ye Frenche kyng was. But or he came thyder saynt Lewys was dede. And ye peace cōcluded betwene Phylyppe hys son and the kynge of Thunys. wherfore syr Edwarde entendynge to greue goddes enmyes, wyth some knygtes of Fraunce whych entēded the same / toke leue of the Frenche kynge and of syr Charl

For at ye daye in the holy lande was no mo cytyes in the possessyon of cristen men, but that and the cytye of Tyre / wyth certayne castellys, wherunto the crysten fled often for socoure agayne the Sarazyns.
                     when syr Edwarde was comē to ye cytye of Acon / ye crysten knyghtes receyued hym with gret honour &amp; gladnesse, and lodged hym in theyr beste maner. where he taryed by the space of a yere after, as aftermeth ye french cronycle. For yt was not longe after his commynge thyder, but that the Soudane of Sury (the whych had wonne al the countreys there about) came thyther wyth a great power of Sarazyns, and assauted the towne vygurously. But syr Edwarde with the ayde of crysten men bare hym so knyghtly, that he defended the cytye and the castellys to the same belongynge, &amp; terrytores of the same / that the Soudane for all hys great multytude and power gate there lyteil honoure / notwytstandynge that he hadde in hys hoste, as affyrmeth the frenche cronycle, ouer an hundred thousande Sarazyns. And more affyrmeth the sayde cronycle, that syr

Edwarde in his polycyes and manfull actes so honorably behauyd him that he neuer dyd such acte in all his lyfe folowynge / all be it that after he dyd many of grete honour. But none that was lyke vnto the actes that he there accomplyshed and brought vnto ende. By reason wherof his name amonge infidelys was had in memory many yeres after.
                     Of the honoure of thys marcyall knyght I haue shewed the lenger rehersall, for so myche as I fynde yt testyfyed of the French men / the which I knowe well by theyr other cronycles that they make of Englysh prynces must be of great authoryte, or ellys by them yt shuld not so specyally haue ben noted. And more ouer I am assured, that yf a Frenche prynce had deseruyd suche a generall pryce / yt shulde haue ben set out and artyculed euery acte thereof, that yt shulde haue conteyned a large worke, &amp; the specyaltyes therof declared to theyre moste laude and honour.

Thys Lowys was crowned at Raynes vpon the daye of saynt Sixtus the pope or the .vi. day of August. By the meane of thys Lowys as testifieth the frēshe cronycle, retourned the blode of Pepyn to the enherytaunce of the crowne of Fraunce, whose name was Isabell doughter of Bawdewyn erle of Henaut / whych Bawdewyn was discendyd of Ermengaunte, somtyme countesse of Namoure, whyche was doughter to Charles duke of Lorayne / the whyche Charles was lynyally dyscended of Charles the Cō

                        whan thys Lowys had passed the solempnytye of hys coronacyon / he made a vyage into ye countre of Poytiers, and there wanne from the Englysshe men certayne castelles &amp; townes, as before in the .x. yere of Henry the thyrde is touched. The whyche vyage by hym fynysshed / he at ye contemplacyon and prayer of kyng Iohan kynge of Hierusalem, toke vpō hym the crosse to warre vpō the Turkes / and after all thynges for that vyage made redy, passed with hys hoost by Burgys &amp; Neuers, and so to Lyon / and from Lyon to Auygnd the whyche for dysobedyence to the chyrche of Rome had stande accursed vppon the terme of .vii. yeres. But where as kynge Lowys supposed he shulde haue passed with hys people as he had passed the other cytyes / ye cytezeyns closed the gates agayne hym, &amp; wolde nat suffre hym nor hys to come within the cytye.
                        wherfore the kynge commaunded assaute to be made / and so continued there hys siege tyll the myddell of August, the whyche was begon aboute the ende of Nouēbre / and loste there many of hys men / amōge the whych Guy erle of saynte Paule a man of great fame was one, with ye bysshop of Lemeryk and other, to the nōbre of .ii.M. or theraboute. wherewith thys Lowys was so amoued, that he made a solempne othe, that he wolde nat departe thens tyll he had wonne the towne.

But peas was to them vtterly denyed / except they wolde submytte theym hooly to the correccyon of the pope. For the offence done to god &amp; hys chyrch of Rome / &amp; after to stāde to the kynges dome, for dyspleasure done agayne hym. In the ende thoughe thys condycyon were greatly agayne theyr mynde / it was lastly agreed vnto, and the kynge with his people was receyued into the cytye. And after he had restyd hym there a season, that the cytezens had agreed theym with the popes legate, and receyued of hym absoluciō / with a new bysshop named Peter Corbio of the popes eleccyon than Gregory the .ix. with other thynges done accordinge

to the sayd popes commaundement: Then kynge Lowys commaunded fyrste the dyches of the towne to be fylled playne with the grounde. And that done, he caused to be caste vnto the erthe .iii.C. of ye fayrest houses of the cytye. And after certayne sūmes of money by hym receyued towarde hys charge / he departed thens towarde Tholowse / &amp; there by aduyce of hys barony, for so moche as wynter was towarde he retourned into Fraunce / &amp; so sped hym on hys iourney, that vppō the euyn of all Saintes he came to a place called Moūte Pauncer in the prouynce of Aluerne where he was takē with stronge sykenesse, and dyed within .iiii. dayes after, whose corps with grete honour was conueyed vnto saynt Denys, &amp; there buryed by hys father / when he had reygned .iii. yeres / leuynge after hym a sonne, the whych is nowe named saint Lowys, and was than of ye age of .xii. yeres or nere thereaboute.
                        LOwys the .x. of that name surnamed saint Lowys, and son of the .ix. Lowys laste kynge / began hys reygne ouer the lande of Fraūce in the moneth of Nouember, and yere of grace .xii.C. &amp; .xxvi. and ye .x. yere of Henry the .iii. then kynge of Englande. The whyche for hys tendernesse of youthe, was thought insufficyent to take so greate a charge / and specyally of ye duke of Brytayne thā named Peter Mancler, the whyche encensed and styred many noble men agayne the sayde Lowys. But at length by prouysyon of quene Blanche hys mother and other lordes, he subdued hys enemyes / &amp; at Raynes was crowned in the moneth of Decē
                           ber folowyng, of the bysshop of Soy sons, for so moche as at that tyme ye see of Raynes was voyde.

Of ye whych stryfe the frenche boke expresseth nat the cause / but saythe that the kynge made good spede to agree theym, for so moche as kyng Hēry of Englande had made laboure to the sayde studyentes to come into hys countre, &amp; to enhabyte theym there with many great pryueleges. But in cōclusion ye frenche kynge so entreated thē, that they agreed to reste there styll.

Soone after ye matrymony was solepnysed / Frederyk the secōde before in ye story of Hēry the .iii. mynded Emperour of Almayne, set vnto Lowis requyrynge hi ye he wolde mete hym at a place called Ualcolour, to ye ende that he myght commō with hym: whyche request kynge Lowys accepted / &amp; with a goodly company kepte there hys daye of metynge. But whan the Emperour was ware that he was commen thyder wyth suche a company / he fayned hym syke,

and broke hys appoyntement. wherfore the frenshmen construyed, that yf the kynge had comen thyder with a small or weke company / he wolde haue conueyed hym into hyghe Almayn, and there to haue kepte hym tyll he had of hym hys pleasure, concernynge the warre betwene kynge Henry and hym, or in other thynges. But when kynge Lowys espyed the delucyon of the Emperour / he then retourned into Fraunce. It was nat longe after that ye kynge was enfourmed of the obstynacy of the Albygensis / the whyche of longe tyme had bē effected with dyuers poyntes of herysy, and many tymes recōcyled by the kynges of Fraunce and other / &amp; yet fallen agayne to the sayde errour / wherfore the kynge sent vnto syr Iohan Beawmount the whych ioyned vnto theym / chargynge hym to enuade that countre, and to waste and distroy it, tyll he had forced theym to restore to the chyrch suche goodes as they before had taken frome it / and ouer that to cause theym to make amendes to the good chrysten people, whyche they had harmed by meanes of theyr rapynes and exorcyōs. Upō whyche commaundement thus frō ye kynge receyued / the sayde Iohan with a competent nombre of knyghtes entred the sayd coūtre, and layde syege to a strōg castell named Moūt Royall. And after many forte assautes wanne the sayd castell &amp; manned it with Frenchemen. And than yode to an other stronge holde than named Saygos / and there lykewyse ordered the same. And after wastyng the countre, wan̄e from theym many townes &amp; holdes / so that in the ende he forced the chyefrules of that prouynce to obey theym to all hys hestꝭ / and delyuered to hym suertyes or hostagys for the perfourmaunce of the same. So yt he retourned into Frāce with greate pompe and honour / and receyued of the kyng at hys home cōmynge great thanke, with many ryche gyftes. Aboute the .xv. yere of kynge Lowys / the warre was quyckened betwene thys Lowys &amp; Hēry the .iii. than kynge of Englande, for causes before shewed in the .xxvi. yere of the sayde Henry. And after that warre as there is shewed ended / the kynge, whyche was towarde the cytye of Lyon to haue vysyted the pope Innocent the .iiii. whyche thyder was fled for fere of Frederik the fore named Emperour / was taken with a sykenesse named dyssenterya of the flux. wherwith he was so greuously vexed, that he laye longe at a towne called Poyntoyse / and was in great ieopardy of lyfe / where lastly after many pylgrymages for hym done, with prayers and other obseruaunces longe to accompt / lastly it came to hys mynde, that yf it pleased god to restore hym to hys helth, he wolde make a vyage into the holy lande, &amp; there warre vpon Chrystes enemyes After whyche promyse solemply auowed / he mended dayly, and was sone after restored vnto hys helthe. whan the kynge was recouered and retorned vnto Parys / he called a coūsayll of spyrytuall and temporall, &amp; there shewed vnto theym of the promesse whyche he had made / requyryng thē of theyr assystence and ayde / wherin he fonde hys lordes were agreable.
                        And in the tyme and season yt prouysyon was made for that iourney / the kynge wyth a goodly company rode vnto the abbey of Cluny, to vysyte the foresayd pope / and he taryed with hym .xv. dayes. And after hys matter with hym sped, wyth playne remyssyon to hym graunted, and all other that kept with hym that vyage he retourned into Fraunce. And vpō wytsondaye folowynge / he kepte a

But certayn of hys vawarde passynge by a castell called ye Roche of Clin / were spoyled and robbed, and some slayne. wherof ye kyng beyng enformed, charged hys knyghtes to assaute the sayde castell. The whych was done / and the Souldyours hanged, and the castell made playne with the grounde. And after he helde on hys way tyll he came to the forsayd porte of Aque Mort or ye deed see / where he toke shyppynge, &amp; so sayled forthe vppon Bartylmewe euyn or the .xxiiii. day of August / and lāded after in the prouynce of Cipre / where he taryed all the wynter folowyng, for some parte of his host that as yet was behynde. wherof ye kynge he was ioyously receyued / and at his departynge thens, kept cōpany with hym in the same iourney. But there fortune began to frowne vpon kyng Lowys. For in the tyme of hys there taryenge moche of hys people sykened and dyed. Amonge the whyche, passed to god these men of name folowynge / the bysshop of Bauuais, the erles of Mountforde, of Barre, and of Uendosme, with dyuers other to ye nombre of .ii.C.xl. whan kynge Lowys not all without troubles, as dyscencions amōge his people, and daūger of takynge of the see, had passed the wynter and a parte of the begynnynge of the yere / lastly aboute Trynyte sondaye he toke shyppynge at the porte of Cypre then named Dommeton or Dōmeson, and landed nere vnto the cytye of Damasse or Damyet the frydaye after. whan the crysten host were comyn nere vnto the porte of Damasse / the kynge caused theym to be shypped in small vessels and so in ordre to sayle or rowe towarde the cytye. But the Sarazeyns beynge ware of theyr commynge, issued oute of the cytye, and defended the porte vygorously / so that many a crysten man was slayne at that recounter. But in the ende the dyscomfyture tourned vpon the Saraseyns. For the chyefe capytayne of the towne wyth .ii. Admyralles were there slayne, &amp; many of theyr knyghtes. Then they gaue backe vnto ye towne, and suffered the crysten to lande. The kynge then pyghte hys

pauylyons, and strengthed hys felde for sodayne brekynge out of the Turkes / and so rested hym and hys people the sonday and mōday folowing. As faste as the crysten made prouysyon to ordre for theyr suer lyenge in the felde, so faste the Turkes within the towne made purueyaunce to conueye suche goodes as they myghte out of the cytye / and lastly sette the houses on fyre, &amp; voyded vnknowynge to the crysten hoost. Anone as the flambe of the fyre appered / the cristen men without resystence entred ye cytye and quenched the fyre, &amp; after possessed the cytye. Here I passe ouer certayne legaciōs and messages sent fro a prynce of the Oryēt vnto kynge Lowys / wherin appereth more fame of wordes than of thynges of trouth Then the temples and synagoges of the cytye were hallowed &amp; occupyed to crysten mennes vse. And there the kynge with hys hoost rested hym tyll the moneth of Nouēber folowynge / in the whych season came vnto hym the erle of Poytyers with a fayre cō
                           pany. Then kynge Lowys with hys people departed from Damasse ye .xx. day of Nouembre, by the ryuer of Nilus, passynge with small vesselles towarde a stronge holde called Maffour / whyther at lengthe they came with greate daunger. How be it they myght nat come nere vnto the towne to laye theyr syege therunto, bycause of a ryuer there rūnyng named Thanoys or Thanoes. wherfore ye kyng pyght hys Pauylyons betwene the sayd ryuer and the ryuer of Nylus.
                        In thys whyle ye the crysten hoost was thus lodged / worde was broughte to the kynge that the Sowdan of Babylon was dede, the whych before hys deth had prouyded a greate host to be sent into Egypte to wythstāde the crysten hoost / &amp; had committed the rule therof vnto an hardy and valiaūt Turke named Saphardyn. The whyche wyth a greate people came downe to thys towne of Maffour or Macour, &amp; there dayly made assautes vpon the crysten hoost / so yt betwene theym were had many bykerynges &amp; skyrmysshes to bothe damages. Lastly the kynge aduerty synge in hys mynde that he myghte nothynge dere the Sarazeyns, with oute he myght passe ye ryuer of Thanoys / cōcluded by aduyce of hys maryners to make a brydge of shyppes so that fynally he cheyned and fastened hys shyppes togyder, in suche wise that a passage was made for his knyghtes.
                        whan the Turkes espyed thys ordenaūce / and apperceyued well that yf the crystē hoost had passed that ryuer, it shulde be to theyr greate dysauaūtage, anone with all ordenaūce and shot that they myght make, they dyd the vttermest of theyr powers to let the perfytyng of thys brydge and passage of the crysten hoost. And to thys fyll an other contraryte to the crysten. For the water of that ryuer whyche was brode and depe was so troublous of wawe, that the brydge therwith was all to shaken / &amp; daungerous to stande on.
                        But these Turkes entendynge to damage the cristen / left a certayne to defende the passage, whyle the other by a forde or passage vnknowen to ye crysten men, came ouer the ryuer / &amp; assauted the Frenchmen egerly / so ye there was betwene theym foughten a cruell batayle. Howe be it thorugh dyuyne power of god, the Turkes were ouerset, and many of thē slayne and taken. The whyche batayll was foughten vpon the daye of saynt Fabyan and Sebastyan, or the .xx. daye of Ianuarii. But yet myght nat the crystē wyn ouer the ryuer. For dayly the strength of the coūtres there nere

came downe and fortefyed the hoost of the Sarazyns more &amp; more.
                        The day folowynge the Puryfycacyon of our Lady, blewe suche a tempest of wynde, y• it dyd moche harme bothe to the shyppes, and also to the tentes and pauylyons of the crysten host. And with that scarcite of vitayle began to appere / so yt the kyng determyned to retourne agayn vnto Damasse.
                        WHen the Turkes espyed the retourne of the Frenchemen / they ordeyned .iiii. barges or suche lyke vessayles / and stuffed them with pytche, rosyn, grece, and other lyquet and brēnyng stuffe / and in the nyght sodaynly brought thē a borde where the crysten flote lay / and then cast on them Grekysh fyre, ye whyche anone set them in a lyghte fyre. By reason wherof the crysten flote was in great ieopardy, and with great laboure preserued from brēnyng. For thys despyte that the Sarazyns had done to the crysten / the kyng was so therwyth amoued, that he sayde and promysed that he wolde nat departe thens tyl he had done to the Turkes some dyspleasure. And vpon enquysycyō made / he was enfourmed of a passage or foorde, that was within .iii. myles of hys pauylion▪ wherupō he called a counsayll of hys lordes, &amp; shewed to them his purpose / gyuyng vnto the erle of Artoyes the ledynge of hys forewarde / &amp; charged hym yt whan he were passed the foorde, that he shuld tary there tyll ye other deale of the host were ouer passed. whan al thynges was ordered to the kynges mynde / the sayd erle with hys company set forthwarde, and passed the sayd foorde wythout daunger / and there forgettynge what▪ to hym was before commaunded of the kynge, set forth incontynētly towarde the Turkes, whyche he weale knewe kepte ye place where the brydge was before made. And there faughte with theym which were al vnpurueyed, &amp; vnknowynge of hys sodeyne commynge. wherfore he slewe many of theym / &amp; after chased the other, whyche for socoure fledde vnto the cytye of Mafsour foresayd / whome he folowed so egerly, that in ye entryng of the cytye he entred with theym, and there was slayne with a certayn of hys knyghtes. By reason wherof ye Soldyours of the towne were so encoraged, that they issued out vpon the crysten and draue them backe tyll they sawe the kynges power come / &amp; then retourned to the cytye &amp; shytte with strēgth theyr gates. Thā kyng Lowis being ascertayned of the sayd erles dethe, made for hym great dole. And after prouysyon made for the lodgynge of hys people / he thē made dyuers brydges &amp; passages ouer ye ryuer of Thanoyes. And for the crysten host shuld be assured frō the sodayne &amp; vnware assautes &amp; reprochys of ye infydelies / therfore he closed theym wythin a strength of a dyche &amp; pale, that theyr enemyes myght no waye haue waye into them / &amp; named that strengthe a park. In the whyche the crysten host there lodged all the season of Lent.
                        In ye whych tyme ye yōge Sowdā came downe wyth a great host of people. And for he myght nat lodge hys people within the towne / therfore he made an other lyke parke vnto the cristen men, &amp; there closed hys peple / so that betwene the crysten and them was many conflyctes and assautes / somtyme to the losse of that one, and eft to the losse of that other. But the Sowdane made all the meanes he myght to kepe vytayll frome the crysten hoost / &amp; stopped all the passages betwene Damasse &amp; them, that from thēs they myght haue no socour. By meane wherof dysseases &amp; sykenesse

fyll amonge the crysten, so that they dyed hougely.
                        when kynge Lowys was ware of these miseries on euery syde, he sente to the Sowdane to haue a truce for a certayne tyme. But in conclusion none wolde be to hym graūted. wherfore of necessyte he was forced to breke hys felde, &amp; wyth as good polycy as he myght drewe hym to the ryuer of Nylus / &amp; so by shyp passed downe by the sayd ryuer towarde Damasse. But he passed nat ferre or yt he was assauted on euery syde / so yt the fight contynued styll without seasynge, to the great losse of the crysten host.
                        Then lastly came the Sowdane with a fresshe cōpany / &amp; beset ye kyng so about, that in the ende he was taken, wyth hys .ii. bretherne Charles &amp; Robert, the erle of Poytyers, ye erle of Angeou, the erle of Flaunders, the duke of Brytayne, the erle of Soysōs. And in ye fyght was slayne / y• bysshoppes of Langrees, &amp; of Soysons with many other of whome ye names be nat put in wryttynge.
                        when kyng Lowys was thus takē he was syke. wherfore with all dylygence the Sowdan cōmaunded hym to be conueyed vnto Massoure / and after caused all the other of hys men to be slayne as many as were wounded or syke, excepte they were men of great fame, by whome great aduauntage myghte ryse by reason of theyr raunsome. And thus was the cristen host takē &amp; spoyled of the Sarazyns the thursday next folowyng the feast of Easter, in the yere of our lord .M.ii.C.l. and the .xxiiii. yere of ye reygne of thys kynge Lowys. The whyche after wyth the other of the nobles of Fraunce were sent vnto Babylon or Cayer / &amp; there kept in sōdry prysōs.
                        IN processe of tyme it was agreed, that kyng Lowis shuld be delyuered fro pryson &amp; conueyed saufly into the handes of crystēdome vpon condycyon that he shulde fyrst render and gyue vp into the Sowdans power the cytye of Damasse, wyth all suche prysoners as he had of Turkes and Sarazyns at that daye in hys power / and ouer that he shulde yelde by a certayne daye a certayne summe of besauntes, whyche after the frenche boke shulde be .viii.M. Besauntes Sarazyn. But Peter Dysroy sayth .iii.C.M. Besauntes.
                        Of these Besauntes I haue lerned there shuld be .ii. That one is called a Bezaunde Imperyall, and the other a Bezaunte Ducall. The Bezaunde Imperyall is worth .l. ducates, &amp; the Ducal Bezaunde is worth xx. ducates. A ducate whyche is named a ducat de camera, is worth .iiii.s.viii.d. A ducat Papall &amp; Uenyziā be of lasse value, as .iii.d. or .iiii.d in a pece. Then yf hys raunsome be estemyd after ye imperyail Bezaunde, he payde after the rate of .iiii.s.vi.d. the ducate / and after the summe of .viii.M. Bezaundes in sterlynge money lxxxx.M.li. And for thys the Sowdane promysed to delyuer all suche prysoners as he had in hys prysons of crystē men. But in yt he brake promyse / for of .xii. thousande he deliuered scarsly .iii. In thys tyme of takynge of the Frenche kynge / a company of yonge men assembled theym togyder in Fraūce / and vnder theyr capytayne, whyche toke vppon hym lyke a bysshoppe, passed by Parys &amp; Orleaunce and other good townes of Fraunce, sayeng that they wolde restore the kynge to hys lybertye. But lastely whan they drewe nere to the porte of the deed see, where they shulde haue taken shyppynge / there they fyll to all thefte and auoutry. wherfore the people of that coū
                           tre sette vppon theym, and slewe

theyr capytayne and the more parte of theyr cōpany where thorugh that symple feleshyp whyche named them selfe Shepherdes, was dysseuered &amp; sparkelyd. whan thys blessed kyng Lowys was delyuered from the daūger of hys enemyes, &amp; was broughte out of Egypte into Syrye / he there executed many dedes of charyte and of mekenes, and repayred the cytye of Ioppen and other standyng vpon the see syde / and from thens went on pylgrymage vnto Nazareth, and to the mount of Thabor. And when he was retourned vnto Ioppen / he receyued there tydynges of the deth of dame Blāch his mother. where after dyuers obseruan̄ces &amp; prayers done for the soule of hys mother / he toke there shyppynge and sayled towarde Fraunce. And nat withoute trauayle and trouble of the see, at the ende of xii. wekes he landed in the Hauen of Marcyll or Martyll / and so sped his iournay that he came to Parys, in ye yere of our lorde .xii.C. and .liiii. and the .vi yere after that he toke vppon hym the voyage / where of the cytezeyns he was receyued wyth mooste honoure and gladnes. And there callynge a coūsayl / he refourmed many thynges for the weale of hys realme, &amp; made one lawe whych is specyally remēbred / that is that no man beyng in auctorytye of any hygh offyce, as Prouost, Pretour, or any lyke office, shuld bye any landes or rētes within that lordshype yt he had rule of. And for that cause that he shuld nat extort or wronge, or bye suche landes ye better chepe by reason of hys myghte or power.
                        At thys day the Prouosty or chyef rule or offyce was in the handes of ye cytezeyns of Parys, by reason of a seale therof made to theym by the kynges progenytours. By meane wherof many iniuryes and wronges were done vnto the common people, and many theuys and other transgressours by fauoure and money passed vnpunysshed. wherof thys blessed kynge Lowys beyng enfourmed vpon suffycyent profe made, dyscharged the cytezeyns therof / and assygned a man named Stephan Boyle in that offyce / assygnynge to hym yerely a certayne stipend for executyng of that office / and ordeyned that euer after, the Prouost of Parys shuld be named by the kynge and hys heyres kynges.
                        He also made ordenaunces to auoyde strumpettes out of the cytye, and punysshement for all accustomable great swerers / wyth many other good ordenaunces and lawes, the whyche I passe ouer for lengthynge of the tyme.
                        In this tyme and season were abydynge in Fraunce in a place called saynt Nicholas de Boys .iii. chyldrē borne in Flaundres / the whych were sent thyder to lern ye maner of fraūce &amp; also to teche ye chyldrē of a knyghte named syr Guyllm̄ de Brunz to shot. These chyldrē vpon a season passed the boūdes of the abbey groūde &amp; entred the warrayn of a lord of Fraūce called Enguerran lorde of Coucy, &amp; there chased and shote at Conyes for theyr disport. The whych were there takē of the seruaūtes of the sayd Enguerran, &amp; presented to theyr lorde / ye whych of hasty cruelnesse caused the iii. chyldrē with out pyte to be hāged. wherof heryng ye Abbot of saint Nycholas, cōplayned hym with the assystēce of ye fornamed syr Guillm̄ vnto the kyng. The whych incōtynētly sēt to the sayd Enguerrā, charging hym to apere before hys barony, to answere to such matters as there shuld be layd vnto his charge. wher in ye ende after many reasōs for hym layde / he by great instāce of hys frendes was

pardoned of yt greuous offence wyth cōdicion folowyng / that is to meane fyrst he shuld pay vnto the kynge .x.M.li. of Parys money, whych is to meane .xii.C. &amp; .l.li. sterling. And ouer that he shuld warre vpō goddes enemyes in Syria by the space of .iii. yeres contynually, vpon hys owne cost and charge. And thyrdely he shulde buylde a chapel wherin two preestes shuld synge for euer, for the soules of the sayd infauntes. Or after mayster Gagwyne, with the forsayd .x.M.li. &amp; other ayde of the kynge / the hospytall in Parys named ye house of god in Pontoyse, with the frayter of the freer minors or gray freers in Paris were made and repayred.
                        Than after many dedes of charite done by this vertuous prince / as makynge of dyuers houses of relygyon seruyng of the poore people with his owne handes, with fastinges &amp; other infynyte dedes of pytye: he lastly in the .xxxiii. yere of hys reygne honourably receyued Hēry the .iii. thā kyng of Englande / and stablyshed with hym a peas as before in the .xliiii. yere of the reygne of the sayd Henry is declared.
                        And that done / he in the .xxxvi. yere of hys reygne, maryed hys eldest son Phylyp vnto Isabell the doughter of Iamys kyng of Aragon. By reason of whyche maryage / the frenshe kyng gaue ouer to the sayd Iamys, all suche ryght as he had in the lordshyppes of Besac, Dampierre, Rousselion, and Barsellon. And the sayde Iamys acquyted &amp; gaue ouer to Lowys, all suche ryghte and tytle as he had in the lordshypes of Carcasson, of Bygorre, and of Anilly.
                        And soone after he sente Charles hys brother at the request of the .iiii. Alexaundre than pope, into Cicilia with a great power, to withstande ye vyolence of Manfrede sonne of Frederyke the second than Emperoure / the whych agayne ryghte withhelde that kyngdome frome the chyrche of Rome. whome Charles after longe fyght, at a place named Boneuente slewe in batayll / and after was made kyng of the sayd countre by auctorytye of the sayde pope Alexaunder / payenge yerely vnto the chyrche of Rome .xl.M. ducates, which is moch lyke after the rate of sterlyng money viii.M.vi.C.lxvi.li.xiii.s.iiii.d. euery ducat accōpted at .iiii.s.iiii.d.
                        
                        IT fyll so after, that in the .xlii. yere of kynge Lowys / Pope Clement the .iiii. of that name, sent a legate vnto Lowys, requyryng hym to ayde the crysten whyche in Siria were greuously warred with ye Turkes and Sarazyns. At whose request the kyng called a counsayll / wherin it was agreed yt socour shuld be made wherfore the kynge with hys .iii. sonnes, Phylyp, Iohn, &amp; Peter, toke on them the crosse. And in the fyrste day of May, the yere of hys reygne .xliii / he with hys sayde sonnes and many other lordes of Fraunce as well spirytuall as temporall, departed from Parys / and frome thens rode vnto Cluny, where he rested hym .iiii. days And from thēs sped hys iourney tyll he came to the forenamed porte of yt deed see. where mette with hym a cardynall and legate of Rome, with dyuers other bysshoppes of Fraunce, the kyng of Nauarne, the dukes son of Brytayn, Alphōs erle of Poytiers the erles of Artoys and of Flaūdres, with many other.
                        And whyle the kynge wyth hys hoost laye at the sayde porte taryeng a conuenable wynde / a dyssencyon fyll betwene the Catholeynes and the men of Prouynce / so that amonge theym was foughten suche a skyrmysshe, that betwene theym

was slayne vpon a hondreth men / and many mo wounded or the stryfe myght be all seased.
                        Soone after the kynge wyth hys lordes toke shyppynge / and sayled with great daunger of tempest, tyll lastly he came to the ile of Sardynes where the crysten host rested theym a season / and after kept theyr cours til they came to the porte of Thunys or Cartage, the .xviii. day of the moneth of Iulii / where they rested in theyr shyppes that nyght. Upō the morne whan they shuld lande / all the porte was beset with Turkes and infydeles, whych shotte dartes and kast stones, to the greuaunce of the crysten host / so that they wanne lande wyth great dyffyculte &amp; payne.
                        whan the kynge was landed, he lodged hys people / and after sent to serche for fresshe water to refresshe with hys hooste. In whyche meane whyle the Admyrall of the kynges nauy came vnto the kynge / requyryng hī to haue a certayne of knyghtes assygned vnto hym / trustynge in god to wyn shortly the towne. And so sped hym, and assauted the towne. But anone as the capytayne of the towne was ware of theyr commyng / he with a great company issued oute of the towne, and forced the crysten hoost to gyue backe. wherfore kynge Lowys sent the Marshal of hys host with a certayne nombre of knyghtes to socoure the sayd Admyrall / and in tyme of the fyght gatte betwene the Sarazyns and the towne / so that whyle some faught with the Turkes the other wanne the towne / wherof the Turkes beynge ware fled soone after / but nat without great slaughter of thē. For after that fyght, many of theym whyche escaped frō the batayll, were after slayne in cauernys and holes where they hyd theym in the grounde. whan the towne of Cartage or Thunis was by ye cristē thus wonne / anone the kynge commaunded the dede bodyes to be caste out, &amp; the towne to be clēsyd of all ordours and fylthes. And when all was done as the kynge had commaunded / he then entred the towne, and lodged within as many as the towne wolde holde. And ye other he fortyfyed with dyches and other strengthes, to preserue them from theyr enemyes / and so taryed there the cōmyng of Charles hys brother and kyng of Cycilia. It was nat lōge after that the cytye or towne was wonne, but yt the kyng of Thunys with a great host of Turkes came nere to the towne, &amp; made showys &amp; offers / but they abode not therby. One day the erle of Artoys in one company, and a knyghte called syr Peter Cabellane in an other companye / gatte betwene the see and the Turkes that they were compelled to fyght / so that betwene theym was a cruell fyghte, &amp; many slayne vppō both sydes. But in the ende the Turkes were scomfyted &amp; chaced to theyr shyppes. In thys fyghte were slayne ii. cristen knyghtes, named le Chastelayn and syr Iohn̄ de Ronssoylyers. After thys batayll or fyght / the Sarazyns made no great assautes. But thē by reason of the unholsomnes of that countre, sykenes fyll amonge ye crysten hoost / so that the people dyed faste. And shortly after the kyng was takē with suche a flixe, and therwith an agu that he kept hys bedde. And after the ryghtes of the chryche takē, and certayne monycyons gyuen to hys sonne Phylyp how he shulde behaue hym in gydynge of the realme of Fraunce / knowynge the houre of dethe approched, charged suche as were aboute hym that they shuld lay hym vpon a bed of asshes &amp; powdre. where he so lyeng a season in prayer expyred, the day folowyng saint Bartholomeus

tholomeus day, or the .xxv. day of August, when he had reygned .xliiii. yeres lackynge .ii. monethes / leuynge after hym the .iii. forenamed sonnes Phylyp, Iohn̄, &amp; Peter. Thē the Bowellys were buryed in Cecilia / and the body enbawmed with ryche oyntementes, was recaryed vnto saynte Denys of Fraūce, &amp; therwith greate reuerence entered. The whych after for hys myracles, of ye .vii. Bonyface was sette amonge the nombre of sayntes.
                        
                           PHylyp the thyrde of that name, and sonne of saynt Lowys / beganne his reygne ouer the realme of Fraūce the .xxvi. daye of yt moneth of September, in the yere of our lord .xii.C.lxx. and the .liiii. yere of Henry the .iii. than kynge of Englande / and began than as before is shewed in Affrica, at the towne or cytye of Thunys or Cartage / accōpanyed with Charles hys vncle kynge of Cycyll, the whych came to ye porte of Thunys the same day that kynge Lowys dyed / &amp; after taryed there &amp; had many conflictes wyth the Turkes / and bare hym so manfully, that in the ende he forced ye kynge of Thunys to seche to hym for a peas. The which was cōcluded for .x. yeres with certayne condycyōs of payeng of certayne money for ye kynge of Fraūces costes, and certayne trowages of old tyme due vnto the kyng of Cycyll ye rely to be payde / with many other artycles concernynge the same peace whyche I passe ouer.
                        After whyce peas concluded and assured / the kynges of Fraunce and Cycyll toke shyppynge at the sayde porte of Thunys, &amp; sayled towarde theyr countrees with great daunger of tempest of the see / &amp; in processe of tyme landed in Cycyll, where Philip with greate reuerence &amp; obseruaūce in mount Royall buryed ye bowelles of his father. And yt done he toke his iourney towarde Fraunce thorughe Italy. In whyche iourney dyed Isabell hys wyfe, &amp; ye kyng of Nauerne &amp; Mary hys wyfe, with many other to the nombre of .iii.M. and mo.
                        Lastly the kyng came vnto the cyty of Uiterbe / where the cardynalles &amp; other spyrytuall men were in counsayll for the chosyng of a newe pope. For at ye tyme the see was voyde by the deth of Clement the .iiii. But that eleccion was so dyuers, that .ii. yeres expyred or they myght agree vpon a new pastor. And thā they agreed vpō Theobalde archidiacon of Landēsse named after the .x. Gregory.
                        Frō Uiterbe the kyng rode to the moūt of Flaston̄, &amp; so ouer to the coūtre of Tuscayne, &amp; so to the mount of Bergue, &amp; then to ye cytye of Florēce &amp; from thens to Boloyng le Greysse and frō thens to Cremoygū, where ye kynges officers were nat all well entreated. In recōpensement wherof / ye mayre &amp; burgeyses of that towne presented the kyng with .vii. stedes trapped in cloth of sylke &amp; other presētes whych the kyng with curteys &amp; thākfull wordes refused. Then frō thens the kyng departed to Milan, &amp; from Milan to Annergeaux, and so to Susane a cytye of Sauoy / and after passed the moūtaygnes, &amp; so into the valys of Moryen / and frō thens tourned towarde the cytye of Lyōs vpon Rosne, and so to the cytye of Mastō in Burgoyn̄ / and passed ye coūtre tyl they came to the abbey of Cluny, and frō thens into the coūtre of Chāpayn &amp; so to the city of Trois / and frō thēs passed the countrees, tyll he came to the lordshype of Parys, and so into the cytye of Parys.
                        
                           Here I passe ouer the great prouysyon made by the cytesyns of Parys for the receyuynge of theyr pryncys / yt is to mene, the corps of Lewys, and theyr naturall prynce Phylyppe hys son / and of the obseruaunces done, and great assembles of the lordes spirytuall and temporall to welcome theyr prynce, and doynge of theyr duties euery man according to honour. But after al these ceremonies in due order fynyshed / prouysyon was made for the coronacyon of the kynge. The whyche was crowned at the cytye of Raynes, vppon the daye of the assumpcyon of our lady, in the yere of grace .xii. hundred .lxxi.
                        SHortely after that the solempnyte of this coronacyon was passed, kynge Phylyppe for his recreacyon rode into the countrey of Uermendoyse. where after he had derestyd hym a season / Robert erle of Artoys requyred hym to vysyte hys countrey. where he was receyuyd of the burgeysys of Artoys wyth great honour and gladnes / and there was feastyd with all disport and gladnes by a certayne of tyme after. The whiche expyryd, he returned into Fraūce
                        About the thryde yere of his reygne / the erle of Foys contrary ye kynges pleasure, toke partye agayn Getarde a knyght &amp; lorde of the castell of Casseboun or Tasseboun / ye which before had slayn ye brother of the erle of Armenac specyall frēd of the sayd erle of Foyz. whyche sayde two erles to reuenge the deth of theyr sayd brother, pursued the sayde Gerarde so narrowly, that for his sauegarde he refused his owne castell, and fled vnto a castell of the kynges / and there helde hym wyth his wyfe, chyldren, and substaūce. But when the two erles were ware therof / they sped them thyder wyth theyr powers. and layd syege to the castell / and in the ende threwe it downe to the grounde, and slewe all the souldyours that they there founde, as well the kynges seruauntes as other, hopynge to haue founde theyr enymye Gerarde, the whyche was escapyd thens secretly.
                        when the rumour of this dede came vnto the kynge / he dysdayned sore that dede, and toke yt ryght grevously. In so myche that he called hys lordes, and by theyr counsayll assembled hys knyghtes, and entred wyth force the prouince of the erle of Foyz. The whyche herynge of the kynges great dyspleasure / fortyfyed hys castell and there helde hym. The which was so besette wyth rokkes of stone, that the kynge myght not wynne to yt wyth ease. wherfore the kynge cō
                           maunded the rokkes to be cutte with masons and other worke men / &amp; made a solempne othe, that he wold not depart thens or he hadde the erle and his castell at his pleasure.
                        when the erle hadde beholden the great power of his enymyes, and the prouysyon of the kyng to wynne his castell, wyth other ieopardyes / he made meanes to the kynge for grace and fynally putte hym and his into his mercy. Then the kynge commaū
                           ded hym to be bounde, and so to be conueyed to the casrell of Beauquesu, where he was imprysoned by an hole yere after. And the kyng
                              •
                            
                           
                              •
                           eased all hys landes, and set a certayne of hys knyghtes to kepe hys castell / and caryed hys wyfe and chyldren wyth hym into Fraunce. But after a yere runne / the kynge was so laboured to by the frendes of the sayd erle, that he was eularged from pryson, and vppon suertye suffred to serue in the kynges courte. where he bare hym so well, yt fynally the kyng made hym knyght, &amp; restored hym to all his lādes. But what fyll of ye erle of Armenac the story sheweth not.
                        
                           Aboute the .vi. yere of his reygne / kynge Phylyppe maryed Mary the doughter of the erle of Burbon, or after some the doughter of Iohan the duke of Braban / the whych he loued entyerly. wherof Peter de Broshe then beynge lorde chamberlayne, hauynge enuy and disdayn / sought the wayes and meanes to mynyshe the great loue betwene her lord and her / and fonde by his meane that a sonne of ye kynges named Lewys was prysoned, the whyche dede he by subtyle &amp; secrete meanes, as though yt had nothyng comen of hym, layde yt to ye charge of the quene. For this ye kyng made many maner of inquysycyons as well by sorcery as other. But in al his workes he found his quene gyltlesse. wherfore he sufferyd the mater to passe, tyll he myght haue more assured profe in that mater.
                        Aboute thys season Ferdinandus kynge of Castyle, that before tyme hadde maryed Blanche doughter of saynt Lewis, dyed / leuyng after hym two sonnes borne of ye sayd Blanch, named Ferdinande and Alphons / whych by couenaunt at the mariage made shulde be heyres vnto the kyngdome of Spayne and Castyle. But the father of this Ferdinande so beynge dede / contrary hys honour and promise, wrote vnto the lordes of Castyle / amonestynge theym that they shulde admytte for theyr kynge hys seconde son named Sāxyon or Sanxio, and swere to hym both feautye &amp; homage. The whyche was all done accordyng to hys commaundement / so that Blanche was dyspoynted of her dower, and her chyldern of theyr ryght and enherytaūce. For ye which kyng Phylyppe her brother was greuously dyscontētyd / and for reforma cyon therof sente vnto the kynge of Spayn his chefe boteler wyth other, desyryng hym to perfourme all such couenaūtes as betwene hym and his fader were cōcluded, at the maryage of his syster Blanche / or at the laste yf that he refusyd yt to do, yt he wold sende hys sayde syster wyth her two chyldern sauely into Fraunce. In cō
                           clusyon ye mother wyth her two chyldern were brought by the sayde boteler vnto the kynge, wythoute other pleasure other in worde or in dede. For the whyche he the yere folokyng gaderyd a stronge hoste, and passed wyth theym by Poyteau and Gascoyne, tyll he came vnto a towne ioynynge to the border of Spayne named Sainterre / where the kyng met another party of his hoste. There by counsayll of some of his lordes, the kynge concluded to retourne into Fraunce, for daunger of wynter that was cōmynge and other hyd causes. But the rumour in the hoste went, yt some of the kynges counsayll hadde receyued rewardes of the kynge of Spayn. By meane wherof the kyng loste that iourney, and returned into Fraunce to his great dyshonour and damage.
                        In tyme of kynge Phylyppes returne into Fraunce / tydynges were broughte to hym, that Eustace de Beau Marche, whom the kyng had appointed to haue the gydyng of the countrey or kyngdome of Nauarye / was besyeged in the citye of Pampulyne. wherfore ye kyng cōmaunded ye erle of Artoys to spede hym thyder, to rescowe the sayde Eustace. The whyche behauyd hym so manfully, that he rescowed the sayde Eustace / and chasyd Garsymerans chefe styrrer of that rebellion, and brought the people of that countrey agayne to due subieccyon. whyle the erle of Artoys was thus occcupyed in the sayd countrey / messangers came to hym from the kynge of Spayne / requyrynge hym sene that he was so nere,

that he was so nere, yt he wold come &amp; disport him there for a season. wher of ye erle of Artoys sent kyng Philip worde / &amp; hauyng of hym lycēce yode vnto the sayd kyng of Spayn, as to his nere kynnesmā / &amp; there disported him a certayn of tyme to his great cō
                           solaciō. In which season diuers letters came out of Fraūce frō some of ye kinges coūsall. By reason wherof ye kynge of Spayne was informed of mych of the Frēche kinges coūsayll. which letters he shewed vnto ye erle of Artoys / sayēg yt he was not without frēdes in Fraūce. But he wold not disclose what ꝑsons they were. whē the erle had taryed in Spayn a cōpetent seasō / he toke leue of ye king, &amp; deꝑted with great giftes / &amp; so sped hym, ye in ꝓcesse of tyme he cam vnto ye king of Fraūce / &amp; at cōuenient leyser shewed vnto hym of the letters shewed vnto him by ye kyng of Spayn / wherof the king was not a litle ameruayled. It was not lōge after yt a currour or messanger, which vsed to bere letters frō 
                           Pet de Brosh vnto ye king of Spayn fyll syke at an abbay. where when he knew he shuld die / were it by exortacion of his gostly fader or otherwyse, he called to hym ye abbot or hed of ye house / chargyng him yt he wold delyuer such letters as he there had vnto ye Frēche kyngꝭ own ꝑson / &amp; after dyed. After whose deth ye said religyous man in cōuenyet hast sped hym vnto ye kinges court, &amp; presented him with the said letters / shewyng vnto him ye mynde of ye sayd messanger. which letters when the kyng had vnclosyd / he anon knew yt his chāberlayne Peter de Broshe was the discloser of all his coūsaylles. wherfore forthwith he cō
                           maūded ye said Peter to be had vnder saufe kepyng. wherof heryng the bysshop of Bayon fled streyght ye lande, &amp; so yode vnto Rome. The kynge thē yode vnto Paris / where he called a coūsayl of his lordes to examyne ye sayd Peter. where finally he was iudged to be hāged. After which iudgemēt he was cōmytted vnto ward, tyll ye morow folowyng. At which season long before the son rysyng / yo duke of Burgoyn, the duke of Braban, the erle of Artoys, with ye prouost of Paris, came vnto the gayole, &amp; there receyued the said Peter, &amp; saw him hanged or the sonne were vp.
                        IT was not long after ye Peter was thus put to deth, but meanes were made betwene these .ii. kynges / so that a day of metyng was appoynted, yt the said kyng, shuld mete to haue cōmunycacion, for the mater cōcernyng the wrōges done to dame Blanche &amp; her .ii. chyldren beforenamed. wherfore ye king of Spayn cam vnto ye citie of Bayon / &amp; king Philip to a town in ȳ prouynce of Tholouse named Moūt marchaūt. where these two princes beyng in cōmunicacyon of ye foresayd mater / certayn messangers cam to thē frō ye pope then Mantyne ye .iiii / chargyng them vpō payn of fallyng into ye cēsures of yt chirch, that they agree &amp; fall vnto accorde, that warre betwen theym be not exercysed. By reason wherof kyng Phylyp remitted the mater to ye pope, &amp; returned vnto Tholouse. where mette him the kyng of Aragon named Peter. The which after he had there taryed with kyng Philip a tyme at his pleasure / he toke his leue of ye kynge &amp; after went into Catholoyne, where he met with Cōstance his wife &amp; doughter of Manfred somtyme kyng of Scycyll / y• which was pryued of his lyfe &amp; kyngdome by Charles broder of saint Lewis, as before in ye .iiii. chapyter of the storye of saynt Lewys is shortly touched. This Cōstance in all yt she might exorted her husbād togader his people, &amp; to enter ye land of Scicill, ascertainyng him yt ye Scicillyens

wolde take his patye agayne Charles, for so myche as they well knew that she was rightfull heyre to that kyngdome.
                        In thys tyme and season whyche was the .x. yere of kynge Phylyppe / the ryuer of Sayne rose of suche an hyght, that yt compassed the cytye of Parys in suche wyse, that no man myght come thyther wythoute bote or barge. And the water passed wyth suche vyolence, that yt brake vi. arches of the great brydge of Parys, and one of the small brydges.
                        Then let vs turne to ye kyng of Aragon, whych by incensyng of his wyfe gadered his peple / and vnder colour that he wold haue gone agaynste the Turkes, hadde graunte of the pope to receyue ye dymes of his owne land for certayne yeres. whyle this was in doynge / he sent certayne persones into Scycyle to see the state of that countrey. The whyche made confederacyes wyth dyuers great men of Scycylyens / and ouer that brought wyth theym dyuers of the rulers to the presence of ye kynge. wyth whom the sayd Peter made certayn appoyntementes / and after retourned them into Scycyle. where after theyr returne, they cousayled so wyth theyr rulers of Palermo, and Messene, &amp; of other cytyes, that in one nyght all the Frenche men in Scycylle were slayne / and after in most cruell wyse slewe the women as wel those yt were wyth chylde as other, and lefte few or none of the Frenche men in all the chefe cytyes or townes of Scicyll on lyue. whē tydynges of this myschyef was brought vnto Charles beynge then in the countrey of Angeou / he sent messangers vnto the pope Martyne the .iiii / requyrynge his ayde to defende his enymyes. The whych in all hast sent vnto Palermo ye byshop of saynte Sabyne, to charge the cytesyns vppon payne of cursynge, to obey vnto Charles for theyr kyng &amp; to none other. But the rulers of Palermo and also of Messene wold not suffer the sayd byshoppe to passe any farther. And also sayde that Peter was entred the countrey, of whome they wolde holde and on none other / wyth whyche answere he was fayne to retourne.
                        In this whyle Charles hadde sent vnto his neuew Phylyppe kynge of Fraūce / the whyche wyth his power to reuoke Peter from Scycyll, enteryd the lande of Aragon by Purpunyan / and toke the cytye of Ieane. In whyche passe tyme Charles entred Scycyl, and besyeged Messene. But the towne was so strongely fortyfyed, that he loste there his labour. wherfore he left that syege, and yode into the playnes of saynt Martyne / and there taryed the cōmynge of hys son then prynce of Salerne. The pope thē accursed Peter, for as much as certayne worde was broughte to hym that he hadde proclaymed hym selfe kynge of Scycyll. And to the entent to styre the more people agayne hym / he gaue his lande of Aragon vnto Charlys erle of Ualoys &amp; son of kynge Phylyp of Fraunce.
                        when Phylyppe as before is sayde kynge of Fraūce had won Ieane / for as myche as the ways towarde Aragon were harde to passe, as well for prouysyons made by the enmyes as otherwyse / the kyng therfore sought great aduyse how he myght with lest daunger wyn to his enymyes. And after many meanes sought / a Russylyan was broughte vnto the kynges presence / the whyche assured yt kyng to gyde him away into Aragon with out the daunger of his enymyes. wherof the kynge beynge glad promysed to the sayde Russylyan fredome and lybertye with other great rewardes,

whyche then stode as prysoner to the Frenche men. After whych promyse made / the kyng put hym &amp; the more parte of his hoste vnder the ledynge of the sayd Russylyan. And for to blynde ye more his enymyes / he sent a parte of his hoste towarde the mountaynes, to make a shewe as though all the hoste hadde passed the same waye. when kynge Phylyp had orderyd all thynge after his mynde, he cōmaunded the forewade of hys people to folowe the sayd Russilyan / the whyche brought theym a strayte and narrow way, all to growen with wood &amp; busshes to the kynges great trauayle and all hys. But fynally he brought them into the playns where theyr enmyes lay, so that they made prouysyon in orderynge of theyr people to set vppon the Aragons. wherof the Aragons beynge ware / supposynge the Frenche men myght not so lyghtly haue wonne vnto theym, beynge then oute of aray and dyspurueyed to fyght, fled vnto the next holdes / leuyng to ye Frenche men mych of theyr vytayll and harneys.
                        when kynge Phylyp had sene that his enmyes had forsaken theyr feld / he restyd him there a season after his trauayle / and after yode to a towne named Pyerlaat and besyeged yt. wherof the soudyours after they had a season defended that towne / in the deade of the night fyred y• sayd town And departed when they had done. But the Frenche men wan shortely into the town and quenched the fyre. and after the kyng had manned and vytaylled yt / he then went to a town named Goron, and layde his syege there about / where he lay long after.
                        YE haue harde in the precedynge yere, howe Charles kynge of Scycyll laye in the playnes of saynte Martyne, there abydynge the commynge of his son the prynce of Salerne. whyther lastely cam vnto him his sayde son, the duke of Burgoyn, the erle of Alanson, Peter brother to kyng Phylyp, Robert erle of Artoys the erles of Dampmartyne, &amp; of Bolygygne, wyth the lorde of Mounte Morency, and many other nobles of Fraunce and Burgoyne. After commyng of which lordes / Charles with baner dysplayed sped hym towarde his enymyes, and so passed the lande of Calabre wythout fyght / and sente his son to Naples with a part of his hoste / and hym selfe kept on his iourney tyll he came vnto Prouynce. where he heryng of the great purueyaūce that Peter kyng of Aragon had made of shyppes, to sayle toward the lande of Naples / sent certayn letters vnto the prynce his sonne, that in no wise he shuld set vppon his enmyes / but kepe hym within the cytye of Naples, tyll he sent vnto hym such shyppes and galeys as he then had redy māned to be sent vnto hym from the hauen of Marcylle. whych messanger &amp; letters were taken wyth ye Aragons / by reason wherof they knewe myche of kynge Charles consayll.
                        It was not longe after or the nauaye of the kynge of Aragons wyth great tryumphe and pryde came vnto Naples / &amp; prouokyd so ye Frenche men to fyght,To myche 
                                 〈◊〉
                               cause of repētaūce that lastely the prynce wyth suche shyppes and companye as he myght make, made out vppon them, and fought wyth them a long fyghte. But in the ende the Frenche men were betyn and ouercomen, and the prynce wyth the more partye of his shyppes taken, and sent to Constance quene of Aragon / and remayned longe after vndelyueryd wyth many other prysoners.
                        wythin a short season after this scō
                           fiture Charlys cam vnto Naples / by

whych tyme myche of the town was tourned agayn hym, so that the most parte of the French soudyours were slayne and fled the towne. wherfore after that Charlys was entred he punyshed them ryght cruelly, by diuers maner of tourmentes. And when he hadde done there his wyll, he retourned into Calabre / where mette wyth hym Robert erle of Artoys. where they toke theyr counsayll howe they might passe the water of Phaar, and to laye theyr syege vnto the cytye of Messene. But for dyuers causes he was counsayled to the contrarye / so that he toke shyppynge at an hauen called Brandyse. But or hys people were all shyppyd / such a sykenesse toke hym, that he was hadde agayn to lande and dyed shortely after, not wythoute suspeccyon of venyme. whose corps was then conueyed to Naples, and there buried, in the yere of our lorde .xxii. hundred &amp; .lxxxiiii, and the .xiiii. yere of the reygne of Phylyppe his neuewe then kynge of Fraunce. Of whyche tydynges Peter kynge of Aragon reioysed not a lytell, when word therof to hym was broughte / the whyche before that tyme had betaken the rule of the lande of Scycyll to Constaunce hys wyfe then beynge in the citye of Palermo. And he hym selfe wyth a stronge nauye sayled into Aragon for to rescow the cytye of Geron, whych was besyeged of kynge Phylyppe as ye before haue harde. And when he wyth hys people were there landid / he toke his counsayll how he myght most greue the Frenche hoste. Fynally he concluded that he wolde make a busshemēt wyth a certayne nomber of his knyghtes / and lye in awayte to take the vytayll that was brought to the host from the porte of Russylyan / whyche porte was foure myles frō the Frēch hoste. Uppon whyche conclusyon so taken / he wyth two thousande chosen mē, lodged them where the pray shulde passe, and was espyed of the Frenche men. wherof beynge warned the constable of Fraūce, &amp; syr Iohon Harcourt thē marshal of ye hoste toke wyth them the erle of Marches wyth dyuers other knyghtes to the nomber of .v. hundred speres, wyth a certayne of fotemen, and went towarde theyr enmyes. But when they came nere vnto theym, and saw they were so many in nomber / they feryd to set forthwarde, tyll they were comforted by the wordes of a knyghte in theyr companye called Mathew de Roya sayeng as foloweth.
                        O ye noble knyghtes, beholde in your syghtes the enymyes whych ye haue farre sought. Lette vs now remember that thys is the daye of the assumpcyon of our blessed Lady / and truste we in her that she wyll help vs agayne them yt ben putte out of holy chyrche by cursyng. For lyke meryte shall to vs grow to reuenge ye iniuries done vnto the chyrche, as though we faught agayn the enmyes of Crystes fayth.
                        By meane of whyche wordes they were so encouraged, that wythoute fere they sette vppon theyr enymyes, so that betwene them was cōmensed a sore and cruell fyght, cōtynuyng a longe season or yt myght be knowen whyche parte hadde the auaūtage of the other. At the laste the kyng was drawen from his horse, and cōstrayned to fyghte wyth the other on fote so that he was in great ieoperdye to haue ben taken. But by his owne knighthode &amp; good helpe of his men he recoueryd his horse agayne. when yt French men were ware ye the kyng was there in hys owne persone / they were the more egre vppon the Aragons, to the entente to haue taken or siayne theyr kynge. So that fynally

they compelled theym to forsake the felde, &amp; to saue them selfe by flyght, by reason wherof the kynge with the more parte of his knyghtes were saued from the daūger of theyr enemyes. But in this fyght Peter kyuge of Aragone was so hurte that he dyed shortly after. whan these foresayd knyghtes with theyr prysoners were returned vnto the Frenche kynge, &amp; had shewed vnto hym of that vyctory, he reioyced therof greatly / &amp; more wolde haue done, yf he had knowen how sore his enemy Peter was woū
                           ded. But to brynge to fyne his purpose, he dayly more and more assauted the towne.
                        In ye tyme that Gereonde or Gyrōde was thus besyeged of ye Frēche kynge / the erle of Foyz, that to the capytayne of the towne ought great fauour, many tymes by lycence of ye kynge yode into the towne, and had dyuers comunycacyons with hym / so that he lastly knowynge the sayde towne to be bare of vytayle, shewed to the kynge that he wolde laboure the sayde capytayne named syr Raymōde de Cerdon, yt the towne myght be gyuē vp into the kynges handes / so that soone after yt sayde capytayne desyred a respyte of .viii. dayes, to send vnto ye king of Aragō to knowe whether he wolde rescowe the towne or nat. Upon y• whiche graūte made / the messangers were sente, and returned with a certaynte of the kynges dethe.

Then the kyng had all the countre at hys wyl, and gaue vnto Englyssh lordes townes in the myddes of walys / and deuyded the coūtre into shyres / and ordeyned there shyryfes and other offycers as then were vsed in Englande. At Aberconow he made a stronge castell, where before was a house of whyte monkes. The whych he remouyd thens, and ordeyned for them in some other place. He also made than the castel of Carnaruā fast by Snowdon, and repayred agayne the towne of Lambatre or Abreswyth which Lewelyn had before betyn downe. Also he garuysshed the castelles and holdes standyng vpon the see syde with Englysshmen / and made Englysshemen lordes of the groundes belongyng to the same. And whan ye kyng had set that coūtre in rule / thē about Mychelmasse he retourned so Shrewysbury, where he set a parlyament. In the tyme wherof the forsayd Dauyd as chyef styrrer &amp; begynner of al thys warre / was there deinyd to be drawen, hāged, &amp; quartered / &amp; so he was shortly after at ye sayde towne of Shrewysbury, &amp; hys hede sent to Lōdon, &amp; set by the hed of hys brother Lewelyn.
                     And thys yere was the fyrste son of kyng Edwarde borne, whyle the kyng was in walys at ye castel of Carnaruan. By reason wherof he was after named Edward of Carnaruan. He was born vpō ye day of saīt Mark or ye .xxv. day of April. This yere also one Laurēce Duket a cytezyn of Lō
                        dō, was foūde dede &amp; hanged within sait Mary bow chyrch of chepe. For ye which enqueres were made, &amp; lastely for yt dede were ataynted these .vii. ꝑsons folowing, yt is to say, Reygnold

of lancaster, Robert Pynnot, Paule of Stepynhith, Thomas Cordwayner, Iohn̄ Tolanson, Thomas Russell, and Robert Scotte / the whyche were all for that dede drawyn &amp; hanged. And a woman for the same dede was also brent. And Rauffe Crepyn, Iourdan Good chepe, Gilbert Clerk and Geffrey Clerke, were also attaīt for the same cause. But they were repryed and sent vnto the toure of Lō
                        don / where they remayned lōge after and lastly delyuered. And in thys yere the greate conduyte standynge agayne saynte Thomas of Acres in Chepe, was begon to be made. In this yere also stryfe and vnkindenes beganne to kyndelle betweene the kynge &amp; the erle of Leycester / whych after grewe to the great dysturbaūce of dyuers townes of Englande, and specyally of the cytye of London as after some dele shall appere.

                         and discharged the mayre of London thā beyng Gregory Rokkisle / &amp; admytted for custos or gardeyn of the cytye Stephā Sā
                        dewyche. The whyche contynued in that offyce tyll the mōday folowyng the puryfycacyon of our Lady. At whyche season the sayd Stephā was dyscharged / and syr Iohn̄ Breton̄ knyght charged for the resydue of ye yere. The cause of thys dyspleasure that the kyng had vnto the cytye is nat shewed of no certaynte. But in an olde panflete it appereth, that the sayd Gregory Rokkisley toke certayne brybes of the bakers, and suffered them to sell brede lackynge .vi. vnces / or .vii. oz in a peny lofe, for ye whyche the kynge shuld be sore dyspleased. But yet to me it semeth no conuenyent cause, to sease the lybertyes of the cytie for the offence of one man. wherfore it is to presuppose, yt it was for a more greuous cause. And in this yere was fully fynisshed and ended the new werke of ye chyrch of westmynster vnto the ende of the quere, begonne as before is shewed / in the thyrde yere of the .iii. Hēry. By whyche reason it shuld apere, yt thys chyrche shuld be in edyfyenge vpon lxvi. yeres. Of the fyrste fundacyon of thys chyrche are dyuers opiniōs. For as before is shewed in ye thyrde Chapytre of the story of Carce, and v. parte of thys werke / thys chyrche was fyrste founded by a cytezeyne of Londō, and after reedyfyed by saynt Edwarde, and lastly by kynge Hēry the .iii. But in the same abbey of west mynster, where of lykelyhode ye most certaynte is to be had / it is regystred that thys sayd chyrche was a temple of the Brytons longe or they receyued the fayth of Chryste. And in the tyme of theyr crysten kynge Lucius, it was hallowed of Augustyne &amp; hys felowes. And secundaryly it was reedyfyed by Sebertus than kynge of Estsaxons or Essex, aboute the tyme whan Ethelbert kyng of Kent buylded saynt Paules chyrch of Londō. whyche was after the tyme that Lucyus receyued the fayth of Chryste, vppon .iiii.C. yeres. Than thyrdly it was buylded by saynt Edwarde the

confessoure / whiche reygned vpon CCCC. and .xl. yeres after the sayde Sebertus. And fourthly or lastly by the foresayd Henry ye thyrde, whiche began his reygne after the dethe of saynt Edwarde .C.l. yeres.

                     IN the .xiiii. yere of kynge Edwarde, at a parliament holden at westmynster were made yt statutes called Additamenta Gloucestrie / whiche is to meane addiciōs of statutes, made and put to suche as before tyme were made at ye parlyamēt holdē at Glouceter. The which statutes were made to refourme suche ꝑsones as mysused the landes and tenementes commynge to them by reason of ye dower or landes of theyr wyues / so that the the chyldren of the seconde husbande putt by ye ryghtfull enherytoures / or suche as were nexte alyed vnto the fyrst donours. By reason of whiche statutes and addicions now in this parliamēt made, suche mysorder was refourmed.
                     In this yere or nere there aboute, in a towne of Almayne called Traiect / many men and women (as wytnesseth ye auctour of Cronica cronicarum) were daūsyng vpō a brydge / whiche lay ouer a ryuer called Moose. In whiche tyme of theyr dysporte &amp; daū
                        synge, came by a preest berynge the sacramēt towarde a seke man / wherof the sayd men and women beynge in reuell toke no regarde vnto the sacrament, nor dyd to it any honour &amp; reuerence. But were it by the wreche of god or otherwyse / shortly after the preest was passed ouer, the brydge brake, by meanes wherof, nere vnto the nombre of .CC. persones were drowned. And aboute this same season in the coūtre called in Englysshe the Swetezers / a woman was delyuered of a chylde, that from ye nauyll vpwarde had .ii. complete bodyes, as iiii. armes, and two hedes, with two bodyes to the wast / and downeward but .ii. legges / the whiche with ye fore sayd armes be clypped eyther others body. And an other woman bare a chylde or a monstre / wherof the heed and the face was lyke vnto a man, &amp; all the body lyke vnto a lyon / with tayle and fete and all other fetures accordynge to the same.
                     In this yere also a cytezyn of London named Thomas Pywylesdon, yt whiche in ye tyme of ye barons warre before in the story of kynge Henry shewed, had ben a capytayne / and a great styrrer of the commons of the sayd cytie, for to maynteyne the barons partie agayne the kynge / was newly accused, that he with other of euyll dysposycyon, shulde make conuentycles and assembles to the newe dystourbaunce of the cytie. wherof reporte was made vnto the kynge / the whiche remytted the enquery therof vnto syr Rauffe Sandewyche than custos or gardeyne of the cytie. Thē the sayde Thomas with other was putte in sure kepynge tyll the mater were duly enquyred of. After whiche inquysycyon made and founde, reporte was made vnto the kynge. Then the kyng sent downe a wrytte / and commaunded it to be proclaymed shortly after within the boundes of the cytye / wherof the effecte was thus, that the sayde Thomas

Pywelysdō, wylyam de Heywoode, Rycharde de Coundris, Rycharde le Cofferre, Robert de Derby, Albyne de Darby, wyllyam Mayo Mercer, and Iuo Lyng Draper / with diuers other to ye nōbre of .l. persones, shuld be banysshed out of yt cytye for euer. And if any of the sayd .lviii. persones were at that tyme of the proclamaciō voyded ye cytye for fere or otherwyse / that they shuld so remayne, and nat to retourne vnto the cytie vpō payne of lyfe losynge.
                     In thys yere also, where as of olde tyme longe before thys season, ye marchauntes straūgers commynge with theyr marchaundyse, were lodged within cytezeyns of the cytye of London, and solde all theyr marchaundyses by the procuryng of hys host / for the whyche hys sayd hoost had a certayne of euery .li: by meanes of the sayd marchauntes straūgers it was at thys daye brought to passe, yt they myght hyre to thē houses for to dwel in, and for stowage of theyr wares so that no cytezeyne shulde entermedle hym with the sayd straūgers nor yet theyr wares / by meane whereof they vsed many disceytes, bothe i vtteraū
                        ce of false wares, and also by theyr weyghtes whyche they vsed in theyr owne houses, to the great hurt of the hole realme of Englande. wherfore sodaynly serche was made, and theyr weyghtes founde and proued false. And ouer yt all suche wares as they shuld have weyed at the kynges beame / they weyed moche therof in theyr sayd houses, to the hynderaunce of ye kynges custome. For whyche offēces agayne theym proued / to the nombre of .xx. of the sayd straungers were arrested, and sent vnto the toure of Lō
                        don, and theyr weyghtes brent &amp; consumed in westchepe of London, the thursdaye before the feast of Symon and Iude. And fynally the sayd marchauntes were delyuered by fyne makynge to the kyng of a thousande .li, when they had suffered by a season harde &amp; vyle prysonement.

                     Thys yere about the begynnynge of May the kynge sayled to Burdeux / and frome thens he rode into Fraunce, where as witnesseth ye frēsh boke he was honourably receyued of Phylyp le Beau or Philyp the fayre than kynge of Fraunce / and after receyued homage of the sayd Edward for the duchy of Guyan. And when kynge Edwarde had taryed a season in Fraunce, he retourned vnto Burdeux / whyther came vnto hym a certayne ambassadours from the kyng of Spayne, with the whych he helde longe dalyaunce. wherfore of ye frēsh kyng he was suspected, that he shuld allye hym with the kyng of Spayne

                     ye haue harde before in the .xxii. yere of thys kynge, howe after the dethe of Alexander kyng of Scottes many questyons fyll amonge y• sayd scottes, who by ryght of enherytaūce shulde be kynge of that lande / consyderynge that the sayde Alexander had lefte after hym thre doughters, the whyche lyuyng theyr father were maryed. The fyrste to syr Iohan Bayloll, the seconde to Roberte le Bruze, and the thyrde to one named Hastynges. Many of the lordes of Scotlande wolde haue crowned syr Iohan Bayloll, by reason that he maryed the eldest of the doughters. But the frendes of Robert le Bruze withstode it with all theyr power. And other there were that he
                           •
                        de with Hastynges / so that after greate stryfe and longe varyaunce, the matter was broughte before kynge Edwarde as chyef lord and soueraygne of that lande / promysinge to hym to abyde all suche determynacyon and iugemente as he shulde sette therin. Than kynge Edwarde to the ende that the scottes shulde knowe perfytely, that the kyng of Englāde ought of ryghte to be there chyefe hede and soueraygne / shewed vnto theym suche olde wrytynges as he lyttell tofore had caused to be serched and founde / in the whyche it was conteyned by the auctorytye of olde cronycles and wryters, as Maryanus ye scotte, wyllyam of Malmesbury, Roger of Huntyngdon, and other, that in the yere of our lorde .ix.C.xx, kynge Edwarde the elder made subget vnto hym the kynges of Cumbrys and scottes.
                     Also in the yere of grace .ix.C. and xxi. the foresayd scottes &amp; Cumbrys, chase the sayd Edwarde the elder to be theyr chyefe lord and patron. And in ye yere of our lord .ix.C.xxvi. Ethelstane than kynge of Englande subdued constantyne than kyng of scottes / and after admytted the sayd Constantyne to reygne as kynge vnder him, by othe of obeysaūs, with feaute and homage. Also Edredus brother to the sayde Ethelstane, subdued of newe the scottes with the Northumbrys / and receyued of them agayne othe and homage. And ouer that it is founde in the sayd cronycles, that Edgar ouercame Alphunius the son of Kynadus kynge of Scottes, and receyued of hym feawty &amp; homage / and helde hym vnder hys obeysaūce as he had done hys father Kynadus before tyme. Moreouer it is there wytnessed / that Canutus in the .xvi. yere of hys reygne. subdued Malcolyne than kyng of scottes, and receyued of hym feawty and homage. Furthermore wyllyam Conquerour in the .vi. yere of his reygne, subdued Malcolyne kyng of Scotlande / the whyche before tymes had receyued the sayde kyngdome of the gyfte of Edwarde kynge and confessoure. And wyllyam the rede dyd in lykewyse vnto the sayde Malcolyne, and vnto hys two sonnes that reygned in Scotlande the one after the other. Also Dauyd kynge of scottes dyd homage vnto Stephane than kyng of Englande.
                     And wyllyam kynge of scottes dyd homage vnto Henry the thyrde, at the tyme of hys coronacyon / and after came vnto hys father Henry the seconde, whan the forenamed Hē
                        ry was deed in Normandy, &amp; made hys homage to hym agayne.
                     Thys Henry that was sonne vnto Henry the seconde is of many

wryters named Henry the thyrd, for so moche as he was the .iii. kyng that was crowned of that name. But for he dyed before hys father, hys dedes ben lytell spoken of / so that of some wryters he is nothyng mynded. And it foloweth in the story, howe that Alexādre kyng of Scottes in yt .xxxv. yere of Hēry the thyrd, or son of kyng Iohn̄, maryed at yorke Margarete doughter of the sayd Henry / and dyd vnto hym homage for the realme of Scotlande / and boūde hym and hys heyres kynges of Scotlande by hys letters patentes, to be trewe vnto the sayd Hēry, &amp; vnto his heyres kynges of Englande, lyke as before tyme wyllyam kyng of Scottes had oblyged hym vnto the seconde Henry / as before in the .xxii. yere of hys reygne is more manyfestly shewed.
                     And more to them was shewed y• popes bulles, the whych were sent before tymes into Scotlande / by auctoryte wherof the kynges of Scotlāde were accursed for they wolde nat be obedyent to theyr lordes kynges of Englande.
                     WHan all these presedentes were sene by ye Scottes / a day was assygned of metyng at Norhm̄ in the marches betwene Englande and Scotlande, whyther vnto the kyng, came the chief rulers of the Scottes. where they excused them to be boūde vnto the kyng for the obseruynge of the kynges ordenaunce, for so moche as they lacked a kynge &amp; an hede, by whome all suche ordenaunces shuld be maynteyned and holdē. But after by aduyce of bothe parties / agremēt was made by the scottes, that they shuld be bounde to obey the kynges iugement. wheruppon bondes were made vpon bothe partyes / that is to meane the kyng was bounde to thē in an hondreth thousande pounde, yt within .ii. monethes after he had receyued the possessyon of the lande, he shulde gyue it vnto hym that was thought most ryghtfull enherytour. And the scottes were agayne boūde vnto hym, that they shuld holde ferme &amp; stable all suche decre and iugement as the kyng shuld gyue in that mater / and also that they shulde vpholde &amp; maynteyne for theyr kyng &amp; ruler, hym that the kynge shulde admitte &amp; chose, and none other, After whych bondes made and delyuered vpon bothe sydes / the scottes seased kyng Edwarde, and delyuered vnto hym by theyr chartours the possessiō of Scotlande, with castelles, with rightes, with customes, and al other appertynaūces to that kyngdome belongynge / and sette wardeynes in the townes, maners, and castelles, that shuld saue to hym that the kyng admytted, al aduauntages and profytes, of the sayde townes and other in that meane whyle growyng.
                     And whan all assuraūce was made and fynysshed to the agrement of bothe parties / the kyng called before hym and hys counsayll all those partyes that made clayme vnto ye kyngdome of Scotlande. And after theyr reasons were wele and suffycyently argued and debated vpon al sydes, by aduyce aswell of some of the lordes of Scotlande as by hys owne counsayll he fynally admytted for kynge syr Iohan Bayloll as moste ryghtefull enherytour to the crowne of Scotlande. The whych receyued it of hym thankefully / and for the same in presence of the barony of Englande and of Scotlande, dyd vnto the sayde kynge Edwarde hys homage, and sware vnto hym feawty. And that done the scottes with theyr newe kynge retourned into Scotlande.
                     And thys yere was takē the forenamed

Madok or Meredok / whych as ye before haue herde in the .xxiii. yere, caused the walshemen to rebell and was drawyn and hanged at London.

But how so it was by one or by both / full vntrewly he forsoke hys former othe &amp; promyse, &amp; arrered warre agayne the kynge. wherfore kyng Edward sped hym thyder with a great hoost / &amp; in processe layde hys syege vnto the towne of Berwyk. But the scottes defēded it egerly, &amp; bete the Englysshe men backe, and brent some of the Englyssh shyppes. wyth the whyche enterpryse they were so enflamyd wyth pryde, that in derisiō of the kyng, they made this mokkysshe ryme folowyng.

                     And whyle yt kyng Edwarde was thus besyed about the wynnyng of these forsayd holdes / he sēt syr Hugh

But in ye ende by helpe of god and saynt George, the Englysshe mē had the vyctorye / &amp; slewe of the Scottes aboue the nombre of .xx.M, and lost of the Englysshe company a very fewe in nombre. wherfore the Englysshe mē in reproche of the Scottes, made this ryme folowynge.

The which at that tyme was sore warreyd of the Frenche kynge, in somoche that he hadde wonne the towne of Margquet and the countre theraboute.

that many men were slayne vpon bothe partyes. After whiche fyght the Erle of Flaunders spedde hym towarde Gaunt, where as kynde Edwarde than soiourned / &amp; the erle of Artoys drewe hym towarde ye Frēche kynge, the whiche shortly after was receyued into the towne of Bruges. In whiche tyme and season whyle ye sayd .ii. kynges laye thus at eyther towne, a meane of peas was there treated of / so that fynally a peas was cōcluded atwene the .ii. kynges, and atwene the Frenche kynge and Guy erle of Flaūders, vnto the feest of all sayntes than next ensuenge. And frō that day, vnto the feast of all sayntes thā .ii. yeres folowyng. After whiche peas so stablysshed / kynge Edwarde departed from the towne of Gaunte &amp; yode to Burdeaux.

                           .In this tyme and season whyle kynge Edwarde was thus occupyed in Flaūders / the Scottes by the entysement of the Frenche kynge, to the entent to cause kynge Edwarde to kepe his countre, &amp; that he shulde nat ayde the erle of Flaunders, beganne to make warre vpon the kynges soudyours, whiche ye kynge had lafte there in dyuers holdes. And also entred vpon ye borders of Northū
                        berlande, &amp; made sharpe warre vpon the inhabytauntes of that countre. And for that syr Iohn̄ Bayloll theyr kynge, after some wryters, was at y• tyme prysoner in the towre of London, or els voyded the coūtre for fere of the kynge of Englande: therfore the sayde Scottes made them a capytayne / the whiche was named wyllyam waleys a man of vnknowen or lowe byrth, to whom they obeyed as vnto theyr kynge. Anone as ye kynge herde of the rebellyon of the Scottes, which to hym was no great wonder consyderynge theyr greate vnstedfastnesse / he wrote his letters vnto syr Hēry Persy erle of Northū
                        berlande, to syr wyllyam Latymer, and to syr Hugh Cressyngham than tresourer of Englande, and to other, that they in all goodly haste shulde make prouysyon to withstande the Scottes. The whiche persones after receyte of the kynges letters, spedde them all in spedy maner / so that they entred Scotlande shortly after, and cōpelled ye Scottes to returne backe vnto a towne named Streuelyn, where ī a skyrmyssh foughtē atwene the Englysshe and the Scottes, syr Hugh Cressyngham forenamed with dyuers Englysshemen was slayne. But yet the Scottes were holden so strayte of the Englysshe hoost, that after that skyrmysshe they wolde nat of a certayne tyme come in playne felde, but kepte theym within theyr castelles and strōge holdes. And this yere atwene Easter and wytsontyde certayne ꝑsones of Londō brake vp the tunne in the warde of Cornhyll, and toke out certayne persones that thyder were commytted by syr Iohn̄ Bryton, then custos or gardeyn of the cytie, for nyght walkynge. For y• whiche ryot, the sayde persones, that is to meane Thomas Romayne and viii. other, were afterwarde greuously punysshed / as fyrst by prysonmēt, and after by fynes. And this yere the kynge in ye moneth of October came into Englāde, and so to wynchester / where the cytezyns of London made suche laboure vnto his grace, that shortly after they opteyned graunte of theyr lyberties and fraunchyses, that had in some parte be kepte from them by ye terme of .xii. yeres &amp; more. So that vpon the daye of the translacyon of saynt Edwarde kynge and confessour next folowyng, they chase

them a mayre of them selfe / where by all the foresayd tyme theyr custos or gardeyn was appoynted by ye kyng, or by suche as ye kyng wold assygne. But ye shall vnderstande that this was not redemed without great summes of money. For after some wryters the cytezyns payde for it to the kynge .iii M. marke.
                     Also this yere kyng Edwarde put out of his proteccyon certayne Alyauntes, whiche were rychely benefyced in England. The cause was for the sayd alyauntes wolde nat ayde ye kynge with theyr goodes, as ye other of his lande dyd / but purchased an inibicyon of pope Boniface the .viii, that they and theyr goodes shulde be fre from all the kynges dymes or taskys. Therfore ye kyng ceased theyr temporaltyes, and suffered thē with theyr spyritualtes tyl they were agreed with the kynge.

For the whiche dede ye deane of Poules the seconde sonday of lent folowynge, denounced all thē accursed that were at that dede doynge, or consentynge to the same.
                     In this yere aboute ye begynnyng of Aprell, the kynge rode towarde Scotlande / and appoynted his lordes with theyr companyes to mete with hym at yorke. where with hym met a great hoost, yt whiche he ladde into Scotlande, and brent and spoyled the countre as he went / and taryed a season at Barwyke. And from thens he spedde hym in wynnynge of the townes and castelles as he went, tyll he came nere to a towne named Fawkyrk or Fankyrk. where vpon ye day of mary Magdaleyne, or ye .xxii. day of Iulii, met with hym ye power of Scotlande, and gaue vnto hym a sore fyght. But in the ende the vyctory fyll vnto the Englysshmē / so that of the Scottes were slayne in ye felde as affyrme dyuers wryters, ouer the nombre of .xxxii.M. and of Englysshmen but barely .xxviii. persones. After whiche scomfyture the Scottes yelded to the kynge the more partye of the stronge holdes &amp; castelles, that they tofore had holden agayne hym, and made vnto hym newe othe and promysse, and yelded them selfe vnto his grace and mercy. And whan he had set that countre in an ordre and rule / he thā retourned into Englāde, and so to Lōdon. where by ye aduyce of some of his counsayll, he sodeynly dāpned certayn coynes of money called pollardes, crocardes, &amp; rosaries / &amp; caused thē to be broughte to newe coynage to his great aduaūtage.
                     ye haue before herde in that other yere, how that a truce or a peas was stablysshed at wene the kynge and ye kynge of Fraunce, for the space of .ii. yeres and more / the whiche fynally was concluded this yere, that kynge Edwarde for a peas to be had bytwene both regyons, shulde take vnto wyfe Margarete the suster of Philip le Beawe / then kynge of Fraūce.

The whyche Margarete whyle the kyng was in Scotlāde was brought vnto Douer, and so vnto Caunterbury / where the kyng spoused her in the moneth of Septembre as wytnesseth the Frenche cronycle / and receyued of her in processe of tyme folowyng two sonnes named Thomas and Edmunde, and a doughter named Margarete. The fyrste of the sonnes was surnamed Thomas of Brothertō, and the seconde Edmūde wodestoke.

And after he sped hym vnto the castell of Estryuelyn, wherin were many of the greate lordes of Scotlande / and enuyroned the sayd castel with a strōg siege. But he laye there somwhat oftyme without wynnynge of any great aduauntage, or hurte doynge vnto the scottes. wherfore of polycy he caused to be made .ii. payre of galowes in ye syght of the castell / and after cōmaū
                        ded proclamacyons to be cryed, that yf the scottes by a certayn day wolde yelde that castell to the kynge, they shuld haue lyfe &amp; lym̄e.

In processe of tyme whan ye scottes had well dygestyd thys proclamacyon, and sawe the strength of theyr enemyes, &amp; cōsydered theyr owne feblenes &amp; lak of socoure / they assented fynally to yelde theym &amp; theyr castell vnto the kyng / whyche shortly after was done. wherof kyng Edwarde beyng possessed, stuffed it with Englissh knyghtes / &amp; after toke a newe othe of the lordes and capytaynes the whyche he founde closed within that castell, of trewe &amp; feythfull allegeaū
                        ce / &amp; after sufferyd them to go where theym lyked.
                     And whan wyllyam walys, whych as before is sayd pretended the rule &amp; gouernaunce of Scotlande, harde tell that the stronge castell of Estryuelyne was yelden vnto kynge Edwarde / &amp; that lordes and knyghtes therin founden in whyche he moche affyed, were sworne to the kynges allegeaunce: he feryd sore leste ye sayd company wolde betray hym, &amp; bring hym vnto ye kyng. wherfore he with hys adherentes withdrewe hym into the mareyses &amp; other daūgerous places, where he thoughte he was in suertye for pursuynge of the kynges hooste.
                     Then the poore commons of the lande presented theym by great companyes, and put theym holy in the kynges grace &amp; mercy / so that the kynge thought then that he was in peasyble possessyon, or in a greate suertye of the lande. wherfore after he had caused to be sworn vnto hym the rulers of dyuers borughes cytyes, &amp; townes, with other offycers of the lande / he retourned vnto Berwyke, &amp; so into Englande, and lastly vnto westmynster.
                     In thys tyme &amp; season that ye kyng

was thus occupyed aboute his warres in Scotlande / the quene was cō

                     whan the kynge this yere retourned out of Scotlande / he caused shortly after an Inqui

And in processe of tyme after, when the kynge was thorughly enformed of ye lassiuyous &amp; wantō disposiciōs of the sayd Pyers of Gaueston̄ / for that he shulde nat enduce the forenamed syr Edwarde to be of lyke dysposycyon: he therfore banysshed the sayd Pyer of Gaueston̄ out of Englande for euer. But after the dethe of kynge Edwarde ye banysshmente was soone denulled by Edward his sone / wherof ensued moche harme and trouble, as after shalbe shewed.

                     IN thys .xxxiiii. yere / Robert le Bruze contrary hys othe to kynge Edwarde before made, assembled the lordes of Scotlande / and by the coūsayll of thabbot of Stone and other that fauoured hys vntrouthe, he sent vnto the pope than Clement the .v, for a dyspensacyō of hys othe before made vnto kynge Edwarde / and surmysed to hym that kyng Edwarde vexed and greuyd the realme of Scotlande wrongfully, whereupō
                        
the pope wrote vnto kyng Edwarde to leue of suche doynges.
                     And whyle thys matter was thus complayned on vnto the pope / ye sayd Robert le Bruze made all the labour he myght vnto ye lordes of Scotlāde that he were admytted for kyng of ye regyon / so that vpon the daye of the concepcyon of our Lady, or the .viii. day of Decembre, a great assemble of the lordes was made at the abbey of Stone. And vpō the day folowyng, by the meanes of the abbot of yt place many of the sayd lordes assented to ye wyl of the sayd Robert, except syr Iohan Comyn onely. The whych in defence of hys trouthe and othe before sworne vnto kyng Edwarde, many reasons &amp; excuses made / and fynally sayd that he wolde nat false hys othe for no man. For thys the sayd syr Iohan Comyn had great maugre of syr Robert le Bruze, &amp; many of ye nobles of Scotlande. But he helde hys oppynyon so fermely, that other began to take hys parte / that in that counsayll rose suche contrariete of opynyons and reasons, that the sayd coū
                        sayll was dyssolued, and a newe sette at the graye freers of Dunfrize after Candelmas next ensuyng. At whych daye of assemble whenne the cause of theyr meting was by Robert le Bruze denoūced and shewed / &amp; many of the great lordes of the land had graūted to hym theyr aydes &amp; assistence: the forenamed syr Iohn̄ Comyn &amp; other sat styll and sayd no worde. whyche Robert le Bruze marked well, and to hym sayd: And you syr Iohn̄ I trust for defence and weale of thys realme ye wyll nat be behynde. wherunto he answered, syr I wolde that ye and al my lordes here present knowe well, that for the weale and defence in the ryght of thys lande, I wolde stande with it to the vttermost of my power. But for I se that ye entēde rather the subuercyon than the weale therof / I wyll therfore ye know, I shal nother ayde you with counsayll nor yet with strength.Shamfull minder. Some other also there were whose names the auctoure myndeth nat, whyche allowed the sayenge of the sayde syr Iohn̄ / and in some wordes admytted hys sadde and trewe answere. For the whyche Roberte le Bruze was so amoued, that when syr Iohn̄ Comyn with syr Rogyer hys brother was departed from the counsayll, and was comyn into the chyrch of the freers / Robert le Bruze hym folowyd and wounded to the deth with his swerde / and after slew syr Rogier hys brother, whyche wolde haue defended the foresayde syr Iohn̄. After whose deth lytell or no resystēce was made agayne the vntrewe meane &amp; dedes of the sayd. Robert le Bruze / so that he at saynte Iohn̄s towne was crowned kynge shortly after.
                     It was nat longe after that kyng Edwarde was monysshed of all this vntrouth of the scottes / wherfore he prepared hym to wende thyder. And at Penthecoste he helde a great feaste of hys barony at westmyster / &amp; durynge that feast made a greate nōbre of knyghtes ouer .CC. after mooste wryters. And that feast ended / he sēt with a fayre company of knyghtes syr Aymer de Ualaunce erle of Penbroke, and syr Henry Percy erle of Northumberlande into Scotlāde / &amp; sped hym selfe wyth hys hoost soone after.
                     Than about the feast of the assūpcyon of our Lady / the kyng faughte with the sayd Robert le Bruze and al the power of Scotlande,Victory agaynste the Scottes. in a playne nere vnto saynt Iohn̄s towne. And after lōge fyght and great slaughter of the scottes to ye nombre of .vii.M, he chased the scottes. In whyche chase syr Symon de Fryseyll erle of Dū
                        barre was takē, with also the bishoppes

of saint Adrews and of Bastoon, the abbot of Stoon or Scoon, &amp; syr Iohn̄ Chambres erle of Atles. which bysshoppes and abbot kyng Edward sent after vnto innocēt the .v. thā pope,Byshoppes periured. with reporte of theyr ꝑiury, &amp; how they were taken armed in the felde to shede the blode of cristē men. And ye tē
                        porall lordes he sent into Englāde, &amp; so vnto the towre of Londō. And Robert le Bruze after thys scomfyture &amp; losse of hys chyef frēdes, feryng lest ye scottes with suche Englysshmen as kyng Edward laft there wolde aryse agayne hym / all comfortles fledde vnto the kynge of Norwaye, &amp; there abode duryng whyle kyng Edwarde lyued.
                     whan thys noble prynce Edward had thus subdued ye scottes / he yelded thankes to god of hys vyctorye. And whē he was ascertayned of the auoydyng of Robert le Bruze, &amp; had set ye lāde in a quiet &amp; ordre / he retourned into Englande.
                     In thys passetyme were ye forenamed lordes of Scotlāde areygned at Londō / &amp; vpō the euyn of the Natyuyte of our Lady put to deth, &amp; theyr heddes after set vpō Londō brydge. And shortly after was Iohn̄ waleys brother vnto wyllyā waleys (whych for lyke treason was put to deth in ye preceding yere) taken &amp; hāged &amp; quarteryd. And some scottes that were taken as prysoners, remayned lōge in Englāde or they myght acquite theyr fynaunce.

                           PHylyp the .iiii. of that name &amp; sonne of the thyrde Phylyp, whyche was surnamed Philyple Beawe or Phylyp the fayre / begā hys reygne ouer ye realme of Fraunce, in the yere of grace .M.CC.lxxxvi, &amp; the .viii. yere of ye fyrste Edwarde thā kyng of Englād. Thys for warre that he had with the duke of Gelderlande / arreryd greate imposycyons thorugh hys lāde, both of the spyrytualtye and also of the tē
                           poraltye.
                        About the .iiii. yere. of hys reygne / the prynce of Salerne, that long had ben holden in pryson by the kynge of Aragon, was delyuered vpon a hard condycyon as foloweth, fyrst that he shuld to the vttermoost of hys power labour a concorde and peas betwene the chyrch of Rome and the Aragōs / &amp; that done to set a peas betwene the Frenche kyng &amp; hym. And ouer that to paye in the ende of .xv. monethes nexte ensuynge, an .C.M. Floryns for hys raunsome. A Floryn is in value after sterlyng money .ii.s.x.d, &amp; so he shuld pay after ye value of englisshe money .xvii.M. &amp; .v.C.li. And y• after that day he shuld neuer bere armys agayne the kyng of Aragō. And yf within the terme of .iii. yeres nexte ensuyng, he myght nat conclude the foresayd peas / she shuld then retourn and yelde hym selfe prysoner as he before was. All whyche couenauntes fermely to be holden, he fyrst made solempne othe / &amp; after delyuered to the kynge certayne hostages and so departed.
                        But thys composycyon or agrement was thoughte so vnresonable vnto hys frendes, that he was counsayled by them that he shuld sue vnto the pope for a dyspensacyon of hys othe / &amp; y• had, they wolde helpe hym to recouer hys foresayd hostages. After whose coūsayl he y• yere folowyng made suche labour vnto Honorius ye iiii. of ye name thā pope, that he alonely opteyned nat soluciō of hys othe, but also by hī he was declared kyng of Scicill / &amp; of pope Nycholas ye .iiii successoure of the foresayd Honorius after confermyd. Thys prynce of Salerne as ye before haue herde in ye storye of Phylyp the thyrde and .iii. and iiii. chapyters of the same, was sonne vnto Charles brother of saynte Lowys &amp; kyng of Scicill. And the forenamed kynge of Aragō that hym vppon the abouesayd cōdiciōs thus delyuered, was sonne vnto Peter kyng of Aragō, whych as before in the storye of ye foresayd thyrd Philip, helde warre with hym &amp; with ye sayd Charles. This prince of Salerne was also named Charles after the name of his father / the whych after hys admyssiō of ye pope, was crowned kyng of Scicil in ye cytie of Palermo soone after / &amp; defended the lāde knyghtly agayne the Aragōs, with helpe of the Frēche men by the terme of .v. yeres after. At whych termes ende Alphōs thā kyng of Aragō dyed / &amp; Iaques or Iames, to whome the foresayd Alphons had be take the rule of Scicill, &amp; held warre with the forenamed Charles, was as brother &amp; next heyre vnto the crowne of Aragō, admitted kynge of ye regyon. After whych admissiō, he shortly after cōcluded a peas with ye sayde Charles / &amp; redelyuered vnto hym all suche hostages &amp; pledges as hys brother Alphōs had before tyme of hym receyued, for kepyng of the former cō
                           uencions. And for a more stablysshemēt of the same peas / ye sayd Iames toke to wyfe one of the doughters of the sayde Charles.
                        About the .vi. yere of the reygne of this Philip / certayne sowdyours of

Fraunce to the nombre. of .xv. hondreth, whyche were sent by the procurement of pope Nycholas the fourth vnto Acrys, to fortifye that towne cō
                           trary the truce betwene the crysten &amp; the Sowdan before concluded for ye terme of .ii. yeres / brake oute of the towne and castelles adioynant, and spoyled and robbed suche Sarazyns as to that towne were dwelling nere and dyd vnto them all the sorowe &amp; shame that they myght. wherof the Sowdan hauynge knowlege, was therwith greatly amoued. But yet or he wolde attēpte any warre agayn the crysten / he sent vnto the captayne of the cytye of Acone, &amp; wylled hym to sende vnto hym suche persones as had broken the peace, and done that iniurye to hys people. And yf he it refused, he sente them worde he shulde nat blynne tyll he had dystroyed thē / as lately before he had done the inhabytauntes of the cytye of Tryple. But they sette hys manace at noughte, for so moche as they thoughte them able to withstande hys malyce. Upon whyche answere, the Sowdan made great prouysyon to besiege the sayd cytye.
                        In whyche passe tyme in Fraūce was borne of dame Iohāne or Iane than quene of Fraunce, Lowys the kynges eldest sonne, that after his father was kyng of Fraunce.
                        when the Sowdan had prepared all thyng necessary for that iournay / he sped hym wyth an innumerable multytude of Sarazyns towarde ye cytye of Acon or Acris. In whyche iournay he was taken with so greuous sykenesse, that he knew well he shulde shortly dye. wherfore he callynge before hym hys admyralles / charged a certayne of theym to kepe forthe theyr iourney towarde Acon, whyle the remenaunt retourned into Egypt / &amp; there to create hys sonne Sowdan. After whyche creacyon he charged them that they shulde cause hys sayde sonne to haste hym vnto ye sayd siege / &amp; soone after dyed.
                        Then all thynges was ordeyned as he before had deuysed / and ye cytie was besegyd with a stronge hoost of Sarazyns, the whyche assauted yt cruelly by the space of .vi. wekes. In whyche season the crysten defended it so manfully, that the Sarazyns myght therof gette none aduaūtage At the ende of thys .vi. wekes, came the yonge Sowdan wyth a fresshe hoost / the whyche made such a dynne and noyse wyth theyr tabours &amp; hornys and other mynstrelsy that they at those dayes vsed, that it was hydous &amp; ferefull to here. And after they had rested theym .ii. dayes, and prepared for the ryggynge of theyr ordenaunce / they assauted the cytye xiiii. dayes contynually. In whyche season moche people was slayne vpō bothe partyes / but the more nombre of the cytye. For by the vyolence of theyr ordenaunce they ouer threwe moche housynge within the cytye / where with moche people were oppressed and slayne aswell mā as woman &amp; chylde.
                        At the ende of thys .xiiii. dayes, when the rulers of the cytye had seen the harme that they had receyued by thys fyers and cruell assaute / aswell in losse of theyr sowdyours, as of the great enpeyrynge of theyr wallys &amp; other defences of theyr cytye / they feryd sore, for y• whych they of one assēt cōdyssēded &amp; sent soone after by theyr shyppes, a great nōbre of olde men &amp; womē &amp; chyldren vnapt for ye warre, with ye reliques &amp; treasours of ye cytie into Sicill. It was nat lōge after or ye Sarazyns made a newe assaute y• cōtinued .iiii. days / by meane wherof the cytye was sore defaced. Then the kyng of Cyprys, whych at y• day was

there as one of the chyef rulers in the cytye, fayned hym lyke. wherfore in ye nyght folowyng desyryng a knyght of the cytye to kepe hys watche / he cowardly &amp; shamefully with .iiii.M. mē toke shipping &amp; sayled thens / leuyng the cytye in all daunger. Uppon the morowe whan the certaynte of thys was knowē / the patryarke of Hierusalem with other there laft to the nō
                           bre of .vii.M. or therupō, sent vnto ye Sowdā for a trewce for .ii. moneths But none they myghte purchase / &amp; therfore they defendyd them in ye best maner they myght. But shortly after for lak of defēce vpon the wallys, the Sarazyns fylled the dykes / &amp; so soon after upō the .xxv. day of May ꝑforce entred in the cytye, &amp; slewe such people therin as they there foūde. Than the Sowdan gaue the pray of ye cytie vnto hys knyghtes / &amp; after spoylyng of the same,
                              
                                 〈1 paragraph〉
                              
                            caused the wallys &amp; toures to be rased vnto the groūde / &amp; the houses, aswell churches, temples, &amp; all other, were clerely brēt &amp; distroyed And thus was ye noble cytie of Acris, whych is also called Tholomayda, subuerted / the whyche was the chyef porte or hauyn towne for crystē mē to lande at, when any hoste or power of them shuld entre into the holy lāde / &amp; had cōtynued for the more partye in the possessiō of cristē mē, by the terme of .C.lx. yeres and aboue.
                        IN the .vii. yere of thys kynge Phylyp / the erle of Armenake was accused of certayne poyntes of treason, by syr Raymonde Barnade erle of Foyz. where vpon, a day of batayll betwene these .ii. erles was appoynted to be foughten at Gysours, in the kynges presence and of hys barony. But after by the great instaūce &amp; laboure made by syr Robert erle of Artoys, ye batayll was fordone.
                        In the .vii. yere of hys reygne, he gadered a great talke of his cōmōs. And in the yere foresayde, at a feaste holden at Cōpeyne, he made aboue vi. score knyghtes.
                        And in the .x. yere / ye glorious confessoure saynt Lowys, grandfather vnto this Philip, was the day folowynge saynt Bartylmew the apostle, translated into a ryche shryne in the monastery of saynt Denys / ye whych the yere before of Bonyface the .viii. thā pope, for hys great myracles was wrytten in the Cathologe or nombre of sayntes.
                        In the .xi. yere of hys reygne / syr Robert of Artoys entred the towne of saynt Omers, &amp; toke therin many Burgonions &amp; other as prysoners / &amp; soone after mette wyth Guy duke of Burgoyne at a towne called Furnes where betwene theym was foughten a stronge fyghte, and many men slayne vppon eyther syde. But lastly the victorye fyll to syr Robert of Artoys / so that he put the duke to flight &amp; toke there prysoners Henry erle of Dabencourt, &amp; syr Guyllyam de Uyllers, &amp; other. After whyche vyctorye by hym thus opteyned / ye sayd towne of Furnes was yolden vnto hym, &amp; a greate parte of the vale of Cassyle.
                        In thys yere also the warre betwene thys kynge Phylyp and Edwarde the fyrste than kynge of Englande, was put in vre, for so moche as the sayde Edwarde toke partye wyth the sayde duke or erle of Flaundres / as it is at length sette out in the xxii.xxiiii.xxvi. yeres of the sayde Edwarde, wherefore here nowe I passe it over.
                        In the .xiii. yere of thys Phylyp, whā the trewce before sette betwene kyng Edwarde &amp; hym and the erle of Flaūdres was expired / he sēt syr Charles de Ualoys his brother with great power into Flaūdres, ye whych made sharpe warre vppon the Flemynges,

and toke from theym the townes of Douay and Bethune / &amp; after yode towarde the hauē towne of Dam or Dan \ where he was encoūtred of Robert sonne vnto ye erle, where atwene them was foughten a cruell fyght, to the great scathe of bothe partyes / for eyther departed from other without great auaunte or bost. Thā the sayd Robert with his company drewe towarde Gaunt / and the sayd syr Charles after the departynge of the sayde Robert, layd hys syege vnto the foresayd towne of Dāme.
                        In this passe tyme the archebysshop of Orleaunce was slayne by a knyghte called syr Gautier / for somoch as the sayd bysshop, as ye fame than went, had dyfflorysshed a mayden and doughter of ye sayd syr Gautier. And for hym was chosen to that dygnyte mayster Barthrāde doctour of diuinyte.
                        Than to retourne where we lafte of the foresayd warre of Flaundres / the sayd syr Charles so sharpely assauted the towne of Dam, yt in short proces after it was yoldē vnto hym. And than he prepared hym to lay his syege aboute the forenamed towne of Gaunt. wherof whan Guy erle of Flaunders was ware, consyderynge he myght nat shortly be ayded of the kynge of Englande, whiche thā warred vpon the Scottes, as ī the .xxvii. yere of Edwarde the fyrst it doth appere / he than made meanes vnto the sayd syr Charles de Ualoys, that he woldc be a meane to the kynge, that he myght be accepted vnto his grace and mercy. So that by his meanes, the sayde syr Guy with Roberte his sonne, vpon certayne conuencyons in shorte tyme after was reconcyled vnto the Frenche kynge. But whyle these conuencyōs were perfourmed / the sayde erle with his sonne Robert were kepte in a lyberall pryson. And the countye of Flaundres by the assygment af the kynge, for the whyle was commytted vnto the rule of Iaques de saynt Paule knyghte. The whiche entreated ye cōmunes of that lāde sternly, &amp; oppressed thē with imposycyons &amp; taskes / in so moche yt in ye .xvi. yere of the kynge, a certayne of ye towne of Courtray in Flaundres after certayn skyrmysshes &amp; loueday made, the cōmune people in a nyghte slewe ye foresayd syr Iaques, and as many Frēchmē as they myght fynde within the towne. After whiche murder was knowen in Brugys and in other townes of Flaūdres / anone by yll coūsayll they also chased al suche Frēchemē as by ye foresayde Iaques were put in dyuers offyces within ye sayd townes / &amp; made them strōge to make defence agayne ye Frēch kyng.
                        wherof whā ye Frēche kynge was ascertayned / he sente thyder with a stronge companye, the erle of saynt Poule, the erle of Boleygne, syr Robert erle of Artoys, &amp; Robert ye sonne of the erle of Cleremount, with dyuers other noble mē of Fraūce. The whiche sped thē towarde Brugys / &amp; in ye playnes atwene Courtray and Brugys pyght there pauylyons and tentes. For they myght not come no nere vnto Brugys, for so moche as ye Flemynges had brokē ye brydge ouer the ryuer yt there rūneth / the whiche lastly nat without great slaughter of mē of both partyes was by ye Frēche mē reedified &amp; made / so yt the Frēche hoste passed ye ryuer, &amp; layde theyr or denauce nere to ye towne of Brugys. But the Flemynges had so garnysshed theyr towne with defence of sowdyours, that they fered the Frenche men lytell or nothynge. And of one thynge they bare theym the bolder, for soo moche as they hadde within the towne one of the sonnes of Guy theyr erle, the whiche before was

scaped from ye Frēche kynges prysō
                        
                        Thus the Frenchemen lyenge before the towne / many frayes and bykerynges were made atwene the Flemynges and them, to theyr both paynes. Lastly a day of batayll by ye prouocacyon and dyspyteous wordes of the Frenchmē was appoynted to be holden atwene them, vpon the wednysday beynge than the .vii. day of ye moneth of Iulii. At whiche daye the Flemynges beynge confessed and reconciled to god, as they shulde forthwith haue deꝑted out of this worlde / in sober wyse, groūdynge them vpon a ryghtfull and good quarel, that day to lyue and dye for the defence &amp; ryght of theyr countre, yssued out of ye town in good ordre / beryng before them certayne relyques of sayntes, in the whiche they had great truste &amp; allyance.
                        Anone as the nobles of Fraunce behelde the countenaūce of theyr enemyes, dysdaynynge them as vylaynes &amp; artyfycers / trustynge so moche in theyr strēgthes, that they thought shortly to ouer ryde theym, &amp; bere thē downe with strēgthe of theyr horses / and without ordre ran with great ire vpon theyr enemyes, thynkynge to haue oppressed them at ye fyrst brōte. But the Flemynges with theyr arbalasters and theyr longe mareys pykes set aslope before them / wounded so theyr horses, that they lay tumbelynge one in the others necke / so that they were the letters of the other whiche were on fote, that they myght not exercyse theyr feat of armes. And also the shotte that was shotte on the Frenche partye dyd asmoche harme to those horse mē as it dyd vnto theyr enemyes. So that in shorte whyle ye felde was all spred with slayne horses and clene armed men. wherof syr Roberte Erle of Artoys beyng ware and seynge these noble speres thus slayne vpon the felde / auaūced hym with his company, and slewe &amp; woū
                           ded of the Fleminges great nombre, so yt they fledde before hym as shepe before the wolfe / &amp; put further backe that hoost of Flemynges, than they by the fyrst metyng had auaūced thē self. And yfayde of Guy de Namour sone vnto the erle of Flaunders, had nat the soner been comyn vnto them / the sayde erle of Artoys had that day wonne the renowne of the felde. Thā the sayd Guy with a fresshe compapany of Almaynes and other bolde sowdyours coragyously entred the felde, and bete downe ye Frenchemen egerly. Than was the medle newe begon, in so feruent wyse that men &amp; horse fyll downe to the grounde wondersly thycke. And euer the erle of Artoys where so euer he wente he slewe moche people before hym. But the Flemynges kept them so hole togyder, yt he myght neuer dysseuer them / and slewe of the nobles of Fraunce great plentye. whiche mortalite thus contynuynge, ye stremes of blode ran wonders to beholde. And alway the Frenche partye weked more &amp; more. Lastly the erles of saynt Poule and of Boleyn, with Robert the sonne of this erle of Cleremounte, and other with the nombre of .ii.M. horsemen, seynge the rage and woodnes of the Flemynges, whiche so cruelly slewe and bet downe the Frenche men / settynge a parte all honour and knyght hode, shamefully fled out of the feld / leuyng the erle of Artoys in ye myddel of his enemyes, whiche lyke vnto the lyon rampaunte contynued in one, sleynge &amp; kyllynge the Flemynges without mercy or pyte. But the Flemynges lyke wood tygres were so enraged vpon the Frenchemen, ye they wolde neuer leue them, tyll they by pure force draue them into theyr tentes / where they slewe of theym a

a great multytude.
                        In this batayll were slayne the foresayd erle of Artoys, Godfray de Braban nere kynnesman to the sayd erle &amp; lorde of wyrson, Adam the erle of Dabenmale, Iohn̄ the sonne of ye erle of Henaut, Rauf de Neell cōstable of Fraunce, Guy his brother marshal of the hoste, Renolde de Try, Esmer chamberlayne of Cancaruyle, Iaques ye sonne of Godfrey de Braban, Pyers Floot, &amp; Iohan Bruillis maister of ye arbalasters knyghtes, &amp; many mo mē of name to the nombre of .CC. and aboue / besyde esquyers and other men of lower degrees, as yomen, gromes, pages, to the nōbre of .xii.M. The whiche after this vyctorye the Flemynges dyspoyled, and suffred the caryns of them to lye in ye felde, that all wylde bestes &amp; fowles myght them perysshe and deuoure.
                        whan this yonge knyght syr Guy hadde thus opteyned vyctorye of the Frenchmen, he reioyced not a lytle / and soone therafter layde syege vnto the Ile or a castell soo named, and gat it also were it by trecheri or other wyse. Then the townes of Iper, of Gaunt, of Douaye, and diuers other of that countre, obeyed to hym / and cōdyscended and agreed to take partye eyther of them with other agayne the Frenche kynge.
                        Than kynge Phylyp herynge of the great dysconfyture of his men / made countenaunce of mournynge, and specyally for his true knyght the erle of Artoys.
                        Kynge Phylyp then after for to reuenge the foresayd dyspleasure to hym doone by ye Flemynges / assembled by our lady day Assumpsion next ensuynge, an excedynge nombre of men of armes / entendynge to haue entred Flaundres, &amp; vtterly to haue destroyed a great parte of that countre / &amp; so drewe towarde his enemyes, so that he pyght ye tētes of his vanward within .ii. myles of his enemyes / and there lay to his excedynge charge, cōsiderynge the great multytude of his hoost by all ye moneth of Septēbre. Of ye nōbre of this hoost I haue doubte to wryte. For mayster Gagwyn sayth, ye nōbre was so great yt it may nat be byleued / &amp; yt sheweth wel by ye expressemēt of ye nōbre made by ye Frenche cronycle. For he saythe they were an hūdreth tyme an .C.M, &amp; .xl. tymes .xl.M. By whiche sayeng somdele appereth, how ye Frenchmē cā make men soūge. But how it was for all this great &amp; excedynge nōbre of Frēchmē / ye Flemynges laye styll vnhurte or assawted. And fynally vp on a great substancyall cause, as ye after shal here, this great hoste was dissolued or returned euery mā to his awne / &amp; kynge Phylyp with smal honour into Fraūce / wherof ye Frēchmē sayth ye occasion or cause was thus.
                        Kynge Edward of Englāde whiche vnto ye Flemynges bare great affeccion, cōsideryng ye great daunger they were in, and he at ye tyme myght nat thē ayde nor socour / of a pollicy cast in his mynde / &amp; with an heuy or mornynge coūtenaūce,Aryght notable policy shewed vnto ye quene &amp; syster vnto kyng Phylyp, ye he was very heuy &amp; sorowfull for his brother &amp; hers ye kyng of Fraūce. wherof, whē &amp; wherfore she had frayned the cause / he answered &amp; sayde yt he had certayne knowlege yt at suche tyme as the Flemynges &amp; he shulde mete in batayle that his lordes &amp; cō
                           pany shulde leaue hym amonge his enemyes / for he was solde vnto them before hande. wherof whan ye quene was thus ascertayned / anone in all possible hast she sent letters &amp; messangers vnto the Frenche kynge, counfaylynge hym to be well ware of that treason and daunger. To the whiche he gyuynge credence / shortely

after sente frome hym the sayd great company of people, and he with a certayne as aboue is sayd retourned īto Fraunce.
                        After whyche departynge, the flemynges were so bolde, y• forthe wyth they entred into Pycardy &amp; the countre of Artoys, and spoyled &amp; brent dyuers townes of the same. But in the yere folowyng as testyfyeth the sayd frēche cronicle / ye Flemynges of Bruges were foughten with of Otthon than duke of Burgoyn, to whome by reason of maryage the Frenche kyng had gyuen the erledome of Artoys / &amp; he of them slewe with the ayde of the Frenchemen .xv. thousande.
                        In thys .xvii. yere about mydsosomer / Phylyp an other sonne of the erle of Flaundres, whyche had by a certayn terme passed ben in the court of Charles de Ualoys, &amp; by hym put in truste to receyue certayne summes of money in Scicill to ye vse of pope Bonyface the .viii, sodaynely departed / and with a stronge company of Almaynes came into Flaundres, to ayde &amp; assiste his brother. whome the Flemynges or Brabanders receyued with great ioy / &amp; by the comforte of hym inuaded the borders &amp; landes of the Frenche kyng / &amp; boldly assautyd the castell of saynt Omers. But for they there gat none aduauntage, but loste many of theyr men / they forsoke that &amp; yode vnto a towne belongyng to the Frēche kyng called Thorouan Moryne / the whyche in processe they wanne and spoyled. About thys tyme dyed Bonyface the .viii. of that name than pope,Boniface the viii. pope a man of euyll name and fame / the whyche by hys trechery caused hys predecessour Celestyne the .v. that was a good &amp; holy man, to resygne and leue his papacie And by thys meane, when thys sayd Celestyne had syttē in Peters chayre a short tyme / this Bonyface espyeng hys innocency, whyche was all sette to the seruice of god, as he before had vsed hym ī ledyng of an ankers lyfe, thoughte howe he myght bryng hym in mynde to resigne hys hyghe office to him. And it to bring about he fyrst made hym frendes secretely / &amp; after hyred one of the cubyclers of ye pope, that he in the dede nyght shuld speke in a rede, and saye, Celestyne yf thou wylt be sauyd &amp; be partyner of blysse renounce thys pōpe of the worlde, &amp; serue me as thou before dyd. Or after the latyn storye, yf Celestynus wyl be sauyd / let hym clerely the papall dygnyte resygne. whych voyce this ghostly mā sundry tymes heryng, thought veryly it had ben a deuyne mocyon. wherfore in all that he myghte, he laboured to be dyscharged / so that at ye ende of .v. monethes he resigned. And shortly after was the foresayd Bonyface admytted. The whyche nat beynge contented with hys synystre opteynyng of thys hygh dygnyte, but ye he for fere lest ye sayd Celestyne shuld repent hym of hys insolent dede, and by strengthe of some prynces be restored agayne to hys former dygnite / he therfore wolde nat suffre the sayd Celestine to retourne to wildernes there to contynewe hys olde accustomed lyfe, but helde hym in a castell as prysoner / where for sorowe and euyll kepynge he dyed shortly after.
                        For the whyche thys Bonyface was nat vnpunysshed. For over the sorow &amp; trouble that he durynge the terme of hys papacy suffred, whyche was nat a lytell / in the ende of .viii. yeres he was taken by strēgth and put in pryson / where so miserably &amp; cruelly he was entreated, that or he dyed, what for madnesse or for hunger, he ete hys owne handes / &amp; so in mysery ended hys lyfe within .xxiiii. dayes of hys inprysonement.
                        Than to retourne where I laft, &amp;

to shewe you ferther of the warre atwene Fraūce &amp; Flaundres / trouth it is that the Frēche men with ye ayde of the Henaudours, made sondry &amp; many tymes assautes vpon the Flemynges. In the whiche dyuers chaū
                           ces of ye warre fyll / so that yf that one had the better at one tyme, that other had as moche aduauntage the nexte tyme. For reformacyon of whiche warre / syr Guy with his son̄e beforenamed erle of Flaundres, that by all this season had cōtynued in ye Frēche kynges pryson, were suffred to go in to Flaunders / vpon condycyon that yf they myght pacyfye the countre to the kynges pleasure, that then they shulde styll enioye theyr lyberte and go at large / or els to retourne againe as prysoners. The whiche erle with his sayd sonne dyd what they cowde to reconcyle the sayde Flemynges. But al theyr trauayle was in vayne / so that by y• day to them appoynted, they retourned to theyr former pryson. wherfore the kynge in the .xviii. yere of his reygne, assembled a mesurable hoste of people. In the whiche were accompted for noble capytaynes vnder the kynge, syr Charles de Ualoys brother to the kyng, Lewys erle of Euroux that othe brother to ye kyng, Guy erle of saint Paule, Iohn̄ erle of Dampmartyn. whiche noble men with many other mette with the kyng at a towne called Mount. And whē they had a season rested there / by meane of messangers goyng atwene kynge Phylyp and the Flemynges, a day of batayll was atwene theym appoynted, to be foughten vppon the .xvi. daye of Auguste in ye aboue sayd .xviii. yere. At whiche day ye Flemynges of Brugys and ye other townes set forthe theyr ordenaunce, and made them a stronge felde / and enbatayled them in suche wyse, that the Frenchemen made daūgerous to set vpon them. Then meanes of treatye were offered / so that the daye passed without stroke strykynge.
                        But in the euenynge / the Flemynges thynkynge to take auauntage vpon theyr enemyes, came so sodenly vpon the Frenchmen, that hardly the kynge myght be armed, or they had slayne two men within his tent. wherfore hasty spede was made, so that the kynge was goten to horsbacke / and forthwith by his marcyall power made waye thorough his enemyes, and slewe theym without mercy. And by the knyghtly example of hym / the remenaunt of his lordes quytte theym so honorably, that the poore Flemynges were layde in the feld bathynge in theyr owne blode to a great nombre / and lastly cōstrayned to flee shamefully, and to leue theyr ordenaūce behynde them. And yf nyght hadde nat fallen on / it is to deme that many mo of theym shulde haue ben slayne / consyderynge the great fyersnesse of theyr enemyes, and the excedyng rancour of malyce that the Frenchmen to theym bare. But yet the Frenchemen escaped not without losse of some noble men. For in that batayll was slayne the erle of Ancerre, and dyuers other knyghtes and men of fame. After whiche scomfyture and chasynge of the Flemynges / the kynge for darknesse was set vnto his tentes with torche lyghte. where after he hadde buried the dede bodyes slayne in that felde, and also garnysshedde some stronge castelles with his knyghtes, to the ende that the Flemynges shulde nat breke toferre abrode / knowynge that with his enemyes he shulde that yere haue no mo playne batayles, he retourned agayne into Fraunce.
                        IN ye .xix. yere of kyng Phylyp / by meanes of Enguerrā a mā
                           
in especyall fauoure with the kynge, a peas betwene Fraunce and Flaundres was concluded the whych as ye shal after here dured but short whyle Nat withstandynge by the reason of thys peas, Robert de Bethune and wyllyam hys brother / whyche by all thys seasō with theyr father syr Guy erle of Flaundres had contynued in pleasaunt or esy pryson, were now delyuered. But the father was dede in the moneth of February before the cō
                           clusyon of thys peas passed / &amp; by licē
                           ce of the French kyng caryed to Marquet a town in Flaundres, and there buryed.
                        
                           
                              
                                 〈1 paragraph〉
                              
                           In the .xx. yere of thys kyng Phillip / a great dyssencyon &amp; stryfe fylle betwene the ryche mē or gouernours of Parys, &amp; ye comynaltie of the same for heythyng of ye rent of dyuers houses aparteynyg to ye sayd cominaltie. wherfore the sayd comons secretely accōpanyed them in greate nombre / and yode vnto the house of Stephan Barbet that was accused to be occasyoner of that dede, &amp; spoyled it. And after that they yode to a maner of his in the counntre named Courtile Barbet, and it in lykemaner spoyled / and that done set it in fyre, and brent it. And the orcharde of the same, whych was passynge commodious and pleasaunt / they defaced and vtterly dystroyed.
                        And nat yet with thys beyng content / they retourned agayne vnto the house of the sayde Stephan / and all such wynes as were within hys sellers, dranke of them tyll they were wood drunkē. And what they myght nat in that wyse deuoure / they bette out the heddes and let the wyne rōne in the strete. And all formys, stolys, &amp; other vtensillis in the house, by them foundyn all to brake in peces / and of federbeddes rypped ye tykys, &amp; helde theym in the wynde that the fethers myght be blowyn a way and lost foreuer / and vnrypped the house in dyuers places, that the rayne and other wederyng myghte entre, as than fyll about ye tyme soone after Crystmas. And thus contynuyng in theyr fury and rage / after the dyspoylynge and defasyng of these foresayd houses, as men nat knowynge what they than dyd / yode streyght in greate nombre vnto the place of the templers there nere, where at that season kyng Philyp with a certayn of hys barōs was than lodged / &amp; there kept the entrees of that place in suche wyse, that no man myghte yssue nor entre but at theyr pleasures / and suche metes as were brought thyder to the kynges vse and hys housholde, they cast it in the myre and fylth of the strete. The kyng and his lordes seynge the rage of thys rude and vnresonable people sent vnto them the prouost of ye cytie with some of hys lordes / the whyche gaue vnto them so pleasaunt &amp; comfortable wordes, that at length he retourned theym in peasyble maner to theyr houses. But vpon the morowe folowynge / the kyng nat forgettyng thys rage and ryot of the people, cō
                           maunded many of the sayde comons to be attached, and to be sent vnto dyuers prysons.
                        And vpon Candelmasse euyn folowyng, for the same ryot .xxviii. of thē were hanged at .iiii. entrees of ye cytie of Parys / ye is to say .vii. at Louure, vii. towarde the partyes of saynt Antoyne .vii. at a place toward the roule &amp; other .vii. in a place towarde nostre Dame or notyr Dame. whych execucyon caused the cominaltye of ye cytie to lyue longe after in great fere.
                        In the .xxi. yere of the reygne of kyng Philip, whyche maketh the yere of our lorde .xiii.C. and .vii. all be it that other wryters affyrmeth it to be in the yere of grace .xiii.C. and .xi.

all the templers in Fraunce were destroyed, &amp; theyr goodes &amp; possessions thorugh crystendom gyuē (by auctoryte of a synode kept by Clement the v. than pope at the cytye of Narbon in Fraunce) vnto ye relygyō of knyghtes of saynte Iohn̄ Baptyst. Thys ordre of templers was destroyed for theyr detestable heresy, whereof they were cōuyct in .x. artycles expressed in the frenche cronycle at length / which here I passe ouer for lengthe of the matter, &amp; also for the rehersall therof is nat fruytefull to all herers or reders
                        In the .xxiii. yere of his reygn / this kyng Philippe, for asmoche as he by some of the electours of the Empyre was chosen Emperoure / he therfore with a great army sped hym toward Rome, and passed thorugh Almayne tyll he came vnto the duchye of Qua rantayne. Of whyche duchye the people receyued hym with all honoure. And after he passed the mountaynes and so came vnto Padua / where also he was ioyously receyued where he tarienge a season, receyued from My layne ambassadours / the whyche offered to hym that cytye with all couenable seruyce. And after hys people was to hym more plenarli assembled be than departed from Padua &amp; yode vnto Mylayne. whome the lordes of the cytye met vpon the waye, &amp; conueyed hym vnto the mayster paleys of the cytye, and there lodged hym / &amp; within fewe days after brought hym with great solempnyte vnto the cathedrall churche, and there crowned hym kyng of Lōbardy &amp; called hym Augustus.
                        Thā he departed from Mylayn, and spedde hym to the cytye of Cremoyne, &amp; layd siege to the same. But it was to hym shortly yolde. Frō thēs he passed to ye cyte of Bresse, where he was holdē out a lōge whyle. Thyder to hys ayde came many soudyours of ye towne of Pyze / &amp; made there many sharpe assautes. In whych assautes Guyde Namoure yt was marshal of the kynges hoost dyed, of hurtes yt he there toke. In pcesse of tyme shortly folowing, ye rulers of Bres offered meanes of treaty. But ye kyng was so amoued with ye dethe of hys marshall, yt he wolde graūt to thē no cōdycional peas / but to stāde at his grace &amp; mercy. wherefore they fynally seyng no better meane, offered vnto hym ye keys of the cytye.
                        Thā kyng Philip for othe before made, or for some other excellēcy / caused anone ye part of the towne dyche fore agayn hys pauiliō to be fylled / &amp; &amp; the walle of ye cytye, with as many houses as stode betwene the walle &amp; the mayster palays of the cytye to be throwyn downe / yt he with hys hoost myght entre ye streyght waye, &amp; so to go or ryde vnto the sayd palays. And whē all thyng was ordered to hys deuyse, he entred by ye way the cytye of Cremō, &amp; therin taryed a certayn season / &amp; toke hys counsayll with ye Gebellynys, how he myghte the cytye of Rome wynne. And whā he had fynys shed ye coūsayl / he toke certayn hostages of thys cytye of Cremō, ye whych he set vnto Pyze to be kept / &amp; so sped hym towarde Rome, &amp; gettyng many cyties &amp; other holdes by ye way / lastly he came vnto ye cytie named Bowlon la Grasse / whyther cam vnto hi a car dynall or legate sent frō pope Clemēt the .v, to treate of ye state of ye empyre.
                        But how it was the cōtynuaūce or fyne of thys iournay tourned nat to the honour &amp; pleasure of the Frēchmē For after the metyng of the kynge &amp; thys legate, ye matter is no more touched. For the Frēch kyng was agayn in Fraūce, or the legate myght bryng vnto hym any answere frō the pope. Also it is the more suspect, for of this

matter speketh nothyng mayster Robert Gagwyne, whyche leueth nothynge out of hys boke ye may soūde to the auauncemēt of the French nacyon. In the .xxiiii. yere of the reygne of kyng Philip / was brent in dyuers places of Fraunce vpon .lx. templers for the heresy before rehersed.
                        And in the yere folowynge, a new rebellyon began in Flaunders.

In so moche that he dysdayned the lordes of Englande, and of them had many dyspytous and sclaunderouse wordes. wherfore the lordes of one mynde assented to put this Pyers to deth / &amp; soone after assembled theyr powers, and besyeged hym in the castell of Scarburgh / &amp; in proces wan that castell, &amp; toke hym and brought hym vnto Gauersede besyde warwycke / and there the .xix. daye of Iunu smote of hys hede. wherof whan the kynge hadde knowlege, he was greuously dyspleased agayne the sayd lordes / and made hys auowe ye hys deth shuld be reuenged. By meane of thys the rancoure that before betwene the kynge and hys lordes was kendeled, now began further to sprede / so that after thys day the kyng sought occasyō agayn hys lordes, howe he myght put theym to greuaunce and dyspleasure. In thys whyle dyed syr Henry Lacy erle of Lyncolne / the whych lyeng vpon his dethe bedde, requyred syr Thomas erle of Lācastre that had maryed hys doughter, that he wolde stande with the other lordes in theyr defence for the weale of Englande.
                     The whyche request the sayd erle graunted / and so fermely kepte or obserued it, that at length he wyth many other loste theyr lyues, as after in the story shall be shewed.

But in the ende the Englysshe men were constrayned to forsake the felde.
                     Thā the Scottes chased so egerly the Englysshe men ye many of thē were drowned in the fore named ryuer / and many a noble man of Englande that day was slayne in that batayll, as syr Gylbert de Clare erle of Gloucestre, syr Robert Clyfforde, syr Edmunde of Maule the kynges stewarde, with other lordes &amp; barones to the noumbre, as wytnesseth Guido de Columpna, of .xlii, &amp; of knyghtes and baronettes to the noumbre of .lxvii / ouer .xxii. mē of name which that day, of the Scottes were taken prysoners. And the kynge hym selfe from that batayll scaped with great daūger / &amp; so with a fewe of his hoste yt with hym escaped came vnto Berwyke, and there rested hym a season. Than the Scottes enflamed with pryde, in derysyon of the Englysshe men made this ryme as foloweth.

                     IN this .xi. yere, ye kynge assembled a newe host and went into Northūberlāde, to resyste the malyce of the Scottes / whiche dayly made assawtes vpon the bordours, and entred ferre within the lande. wherfore for great dystresse &amp; nede of fyghting men, the kynge had moch people out of ye southe and east partyes of Englande. Amonge the whiche contrary to theyr lybertye, the cyte of London was constrayned to fynde at theyr costes and charge .CC. men, and so sent theym to yorke. whan the kynge at yorke hadde receyued his people frome sundry countrees and good townes of Englande / he with a conuenyent noumbre rode towarde Berwyke, &amp; so sped his iournayes that at lengthe he came nere vnto Berwyke, and layde his syege aboute ye fame.
                     But whyle the kynge was besyed in assawtynge of the towne / the Scottes brake ouer the water of Swale in great noumbre / &amp; leuynge the cooste where the kynges people laye, in secrete wyse came downe into

the marchis of yorke shyre, and there slewe the people and robbed them in moost cruell wyse. wherefore ye arche bisshop of yorke constrayned of pure necessyte to defende that countre, gathered vnto hym an vnredy &amp; dispurueyed hoost for ye warre, as pryours clerkes, chanons, and other spyrituel men of the churche, wyth husbande men and other vnapte people / and so with great nombre of men and fewe warly or discrete cheuetaynes, yode agayne ye Scottes / and them encoū

But for lacke of wyse and warely prouysyon, the Englysshemē were beset of theyr enemyes vpon euery side / so that of them was slayne a great multytude, &amp; the remenaunt shamefullye put to flyghte / by reason wherof the sayde archebisshop with the abbot of Selby and other were preseruyd. And for so many spyrytuell mē were slayne in thys batayl / therfore it was after named of many wrytters the whyte batayll. whan the kynge was enfourmed of this ouerthrowe of the Northyrne men, and for it drewe towarde wynter / he therfore brake vp hys siege and retourued vnto yorke and soone after forther into Englād. Than was nothyng done without ye aduyces and coūceylys of syr Hughe the spēcers, the father and the sonne. By whose entysemēt many thynges were done in Englande, to the great grudge as well of the noble men of the realme as of the commons of the same / so yt they were had in as greate hatred and indygnacyon, as before tymes was Pyers of Ga

                     IN this .xii. yere, the kyng helde hys greate counceyll at yorke / where cōtrary the mynde of ye lordes syr Hughe Spencer the sonne was made hyghe chaumberlayne of Englāde. By reason wherof he bare hym so hawtely and so prowde, that no lorde of thys lande myght gaynsaye hym in any thynge that he thoughte good. wherof grewe the occasyon of the barons warre as after foloweth. In thys passetyme for asmoche as ye foresayd cardinalles might nothyng do concernyng the peace betwene Englande and Scotlande / the kynge purchased a curse of the .xxii. Iohan then pope, to accurse Robert le Bruze and all suche as wyth hym helde or maynteyned / and it to stande so in strenght, tyll the sayd Robert had recompensed kynge Edwarde for all suche harmys as hys lande had by hym receyued / &amp; also tyl he had reedifyed the monasteryes and churches by hym and hys caste downe in Englande, and restored to them suche spirytuell goodes as the Scottes had reued and taken from them. But all thys auayled nothyng, but putte the kyng and the realme to great coste &amp; charge / so that ye comons were vexed and trowbled many maner of ways / and theyr possessyons and moueable goodes taken from them, vpon surmysed &amp; feyned causes / so that many were vtterly vndoon, and a fewe synguler

&amp; mysguyded persones auaū
                        ced. whan the more partye of the barones of Englande behelde this mysery of the people, how they were punyshed by the hande of god, and also by the ygnoraunce of the kynge / they in secrete maner assembled them togyder at a towne called Shyrborn̄ in 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and there condiscēded for a reformacyon of this myschefe, to remoue from the kynge the sayd Spēsers bothe the father and the sonne. And this to brynge aboute syr Thomas erle of Lancastre, syr Humfrey Bohum erle of Hereforde, syr Iohan Moubray barō, syr Roger Clyfforde barō, syr Goselyn Danyell barō, syr Roger Toket, Roger Benefeelde, syr Roger Mortymer, Syr whyllyā Sullāde, syr wyllyam Elmynbrydge, syr Iohan Gyfforde, and syr Iohan Tyers barons and knyghtes, with dyuers other sware eche of thē to stāde by other, tyll they had amended the state of the realme. And soone after by theyr aduyce and agrement, syr Iohan Moubraye, syr Roger Clyfforde, and syr Goselyn Danyel, with a stronge company entred vpon the manours and castelles of the sayde Spensers standynge in the marche of wales, and them spoyled and destroyed. Of the whiche ryot the Spēsers complayned them to the kynge. In punysshent wherof, the kynge callynge to hym dyuerse of his coūceyll at wyndsore / there determyned that the sayde syr Iohan Moubraye, syr Roger Clyfforde, &amp; syr Goselyn Danyell, with other theyr assystentes, shulde appere before the kynges counsayle shortly after / and there to make answere vpon that ryot. And yf they refused that to do / that than they shulde auoyde the lande shortly after as banysshed men. But no day of apparence by theym was kepte. wherfore proclamacyons were made in dyuers placys of the realme, and at London the .xvi. daye of Marche, that the sayde syr Iohan Moubray, syr Roger Clyfforde and other, shuld auoyde the lande within .x. dayes folowynge vpon payne of dethe. wherof herynge ye lordes and barones before named, assembled theym a more strenger power / and vpon that sent a messynger vnto ye kynge, besechynge hym humbly to remoue frome his persone and coūseyle the Spensers, ye which dayly dyd vnto hym great dyshonour, and to the comune weale of the realme great hynderaūce. The kynge herynge this humble request, nothynge with it beynge contente, but ferynge greatly the destruccyon of his owne persone / assembled his coūfeyle for reformacyon of this mater. where it was concluded that the kynge shulde call a parlyamente at London, there to be holden in the 
                           〈◊〉
                         folowynge. And that conclusyon so there taken by the sayde counseyle / the kynge sent his letters vnto the sayde barones, commaundynge theym to come vnto the sayde parlyament. The whiche at the day aboue sayde, with a great hoste of men of armes came to London / in a sute of iakettes of cotes of demy partye of yelowe and grene, with a bāde of whyte cast ouerthwarte.
                     For this skyll that parlyamente lōge after of the comune people was called the parlyament of whyte bandes.
                     Than for to se the kynges pease were substancyally kepte within the cytye of London / the mayre caused dayly a thousande men well harnessed to watche in dyuers wardes, and at dyuerse gates of ye cytye / ye whiche began at foure of the clocke in the mornynge, and so contynued tyll .vi. at nyghte. At whiche season as many were ordeyned too take thanne

the charge of the nyght watche, and so to contynue tyll the houre of .v. in the mornynge. And for thys nyghte watche shuld be surely kept / two aldremē nyghtly were assygned to ryde about the cytie with certayne officers of the towne, to see the watchemen wele and dyscretly guyded. And the gates were shyt at .ix. of the clocke, &amp; opened agayne at .vii. on the morow &amp; euery cytezyn warned to haue hys harneys by hym, that he myghte be redy with shorte warnynge when so euer he were called.
                     Thus in ye cytye the sayd watche cō
                        tynuyng / the foresayde parlyamente was holden at westmynster / where amonge other thynges for the weale of the lande, as that counceyll than coulde thynke determyned / one was that syr Hugh Spenser the father &amp; syr Hughe the sonne, shuld be banysshed out of yt realme of England for terme of lyfe. And soone after that banysshement was put in execucion / so that they bothe were broughte vnto Douer, there to take shyppynge. where syr Hugh the father made wō
                        derfull great moone when he shulde take hys shyp / and cursed hys sonne in presence of suche as had the Guydynge of thē / sayng that by hys meanes he was banysshed from the flour of all landes cristened. Than ye kyng dyssolued the parlyament, and euery man retourned to hys owne. But yt was nat longe after that worde was broughte vnto the kyng, yt syr Hugh Spenser the sonne houyd vpon the cooste of Englande, and toke prayes of all marchaūtes that passed by hys course.
                     But the kyng let as he had knowē of no suche thyng / and suffered that wyth many mo euyl dedes to go vnpunysshed / the whyche at lengthe he repented full soore, and toke thereof great remors in conscyence, as it appereth in the ende of hys reygne.

                              Thy bowels in the fyre were throwe
                              and burned longe,

                              an axe was slytte,

                        In thys meane tyme and season, the kynge was conueyed vnto the castell of Kenelworthe, and there kepte vnder the garde of syr Henry of Lancaster or brother vnto the erle Thomas of Lancaster that was behedyd at Pounfrette. And mayster Robert Baldoke the kynges chauncelloure was sent vnto London, and put into the pryson of Newgate / where after he dyed myserably. The erle Iohn̄ of Arundell was also put to deth at Herforde, wythin foure dayes of syr Hugh the yonger Spenser. Then ye quene wyth syr Edwarde hyr sonne and with a goodly company of lordes and gentylmen retourned vnto London / and there of the cytesyns wyth greate honoure and ioye was receyued, vppon the daye of saynte Barbara, or the .iiii. daye of December / and so conueyed vnto westmynster. where in the octauys of the Epyphanye of our lorde, a parlyament was holden / durynge the whych certayne solēpne messangers were sent vnto the kynge to the castell of Kenelworthe / that is to saye, thre bysshoppes, thre erles, two abbottes, ii. barons, and two iustyces, wyth the procuratoure of that parlyament syr wyllyam Trussell, to depose hym of all kyngly dygnytye, as before was agreed by all the lordes spyrytuall and temporall and comons of ye sayd parlyament / and they to resygne vnto the kynge, all homages and feautyes to hym before made in the name of all the barony of England. Then the forenamed syr wyllyam Trussell vppon the daye of the conuersyon of saynte Poule or the .xxv. daye of Ianuary, by the authoryte of hys offyce in the presence of the foresayd lordes hadde these wordes folowynge vnto the kynge.

And I shall neuer be attendaunt vnto ye as kynge after thys tyme. And thus was Edwarde the seconde deposyd and his sonne made kynge / when he hadde reygned full .xviii. yeres .vi. monethes &amp; odde dayes. Than Edwarde thus remaynynge in pryson, as fyrst in the castell of Kenelworth, &amp; after in the castell of Barkle / toke greate repētaūce of hys former lyfe, and made a lamentable complaynte for that he hadde so greuously offended god▪ wherof a parte I haue after set out / but not all, leste it shulde be

                        ye haue before in the .xxvii. yere of Philip father vnto this Lewys hard howe the Flemynges agayne rebelled / &amp; howe by the meane of Enguerram, the Frenche hoste was then retourned with dishonour into Fraūce for reuengemēt wherof, thys Lewys assembled a ryght stronge armye of the more partye of all the noble men of Fraūce / &amp; in the moneth of Septē
                           bre entred the countrey of Flaūders &amp; so came vnto ye towne or nere there vnto called Courtray, &amp; lodged hys people nere vnto the ryuer of Lys or Lyse, for so moche as ye brydges ouer that ryuer by the Flemynges were brokē. where the kyng with hys host so lyēge / the Flemynges vpō ye other syde laye in howge nombre for to defende the passage of the Frenchmen. In whyche tyme &amp; season fell suche plenty of rayne, that the ways waxed noyous &amp; foule in all that countrey. By reason whereof vytayll whyche thā was as aboue is sayd scant, was than more scars.
                        And ouer ye the feelde where the hoste laye was so wete &amp; myry / that men and beastes were to greuously noyed. wherefore in conclusyō ye kyng consyderyng those great hynderaunces &amp; harmes to hys lordes &amp; comōs, &amp; that he myght in no maner wynne ouer to hys enemyes / he retourned as other before times had done, with lytell honour into Fraūce / to ye great losse of ye kynges ordenaūce &amp; other stuffe that myght nat be caryed thēs by reason of depenes of the way. For whych cause &amp; causes, the kyng was so soore displeased / yt he made then a great othe, that yf he myght lyue tyll the yere folowyng, yt he shuld be sette so the Flemynges yt they shuld nat escape hys daūger / &amp; yt he shuld neuer take treatye nor ende with thē, except they wolde fully &amp; holy put thē in his grace &amp; mercy. But in the yere folowynge about ye feest of Pentecoste whē the sayd Lewys had scantly reygned ii. yeres, he dyed at Boys in Uyncent &amp; the .vi. daye of Iunii honorablye was buryed at saynt Denyse, leuyng after hym none issue male / wherfore hys brother Phylype succeded hym in the kyngdome.

                           PHylyp the .v. of that name and brother of the forenamed Lewys, whyche for his heygth was surnamed Phylyp the longe / began hys reygne ouer ye Frēchmē in ye yere

of our lorde .M.CCC. and .xvii, and the .x. yere of Edwarde the seconde than kynge of Englande. But fyrste he reygned but as regent of Fraūce, for so moche as Clemence the wyfe of kynge Lewys was left of her sayd husbande with chylde. The whiche in processe of tyme was delyuered of a man chylde named Iohan, that dyed shortly after. After whose dethe ye sayd Phylyp was forthwith proclaymed kynge of Fraunce, and crowned at Parys aboute Chrystmas folowynge / al be it yt the duke of Burgoyn with other for a whyle with sayd that coronacyon / and wolde haue preferred the doughter of Lewys last deed. But other of the lordes and nobles of Fraunce wolde not be agreable, yt a woman shulde enheryte so great a kyngdome. By meane wherof vnkyndnes kyndled atwene the kynge and the sayd duke. But by wyse medyatoures they were after acorded, in suche wyse that the sayd duke maryed the eldest doughter of ye kynge.
                        In this passe tyme suche meanes were made by the Flemynges, that an vnyte and accorde was stablysshed atwene Fraunce and them for ye tyme that it helde. whiche peace as testyfyeth the Frenche cronycle, was laboured and ended by a cardynall named Iosselyn, &amp; sent frome ye .xxii. Iohan than pope / so that by medyacyon of the sayd cardynall, the erle of Flaūdres was receyued vnto ye kynges grace / and at Parys dyd vnto ye Frenche kynge his homage, &amp; sware vnto hym feawtye.
                        In the thyrde yere of the reygne of this Phylyp / the prouost of Parys hauyng in his pryson a Pycarde a man of great rychesse, whiche for felony or lyke cryme was iudged to be hanged. The sayd prouoste for great benefyte to hym doone, and payment of great summes by ye sayd Pycarde, toke an other poore innocent man &amp; put hym to dethe in stede of the sayd Pycarde. Of the whiche offence whā due profe of it was made before the kynges counceyll / the sayd prouoste for the same dede was put vnto lyke iudgment.
                        In the fyfth yere of the sayd Phylyp, all the lazaryes of the countrey of Langadocke were brente, for so moche as they were accused of theyr owne confessyon proued, that they had poysoned and entended to haue poysoned all the welles of that countrey. And for many Iewes were vnto them consentynge / therfore many of them suffered lyke iudgment. In this yere also for somoche as in those dayes in dyuers places of Fraunce, a fonde prophecy was broughte vp amōge the comune people, that shepherdes and herdes shulde wynne the holy lande. Than they assembled thē selfe in dyuers places and companyes, and lastly came togyder at Parys. where they were so many in nombre, by reason of other of the comune people that fell vnto them, that the Prouost of Parys was not of power to withstande thē / so that they brake prysones and toke out suche persones as them pleased / and from thens wente beggynge and robbynge tyll they came into Langedocke. where they fel vpon the Iewes, and robbed theym of all suche mouables as they myght fynde, and slewe of theym also. wherfore the other of the Iewes ferynge the sayd comunes / gathered them with theyr wyues &amp; chyldren to the noūbre of .v.C. into a towre, and thought to defende them &amp; theyr wyues and chyldren from the sayd herdes. But anone as they hadde wyttynge therof / they assawted the sayd towre so egerly, that in the ende seynge they myght not escape, for very despyte they threwe theyr chyldren

downe at theyr hedes / &amp; after slewe eyther other, for they shulde not fall in the handes of theyr enemyes / or elles to auoyde ye peynes of the fyre, whiche the herdes hadde begunne to fasten vpon the sayd towre. whā the sayd Herdes hadde thus robbed and slayne ye Iewes of Langdocke / they departed thens and yode towarde a a countrey called Carcasson, entendynge lyke robbery as they before had vsed. wherof ye countrey beynge warned / stopped &amp; kepte so the passages, &amp; withstode them with suche power and strengthe, that they dysseuered thē selfe by small companyes / so that many of them were taken and hanged, &amp; the other fled in saue gardynge them selfe / and so this folysshe prophecy was ended with synne and shame.
                        Kynge Phylyppe by meane of yll coūseyle sette a great taske vpon his comunes / that is to meane the fyfth parte of theyr mouable goodes. For the whiche, consyderynge he had no charg of warres ī no place, they murmured &amp; grudged wonder sore. But how it was or this taxe was leuyed / he fell in a feuer quarteyne &amp; a great flyx. whiche sekenesse fell vpon hym by prayer of the comunes after the Frenche boke, for leuyenge of ye sayd greuous taxe. Than for hym was made many solempne processyons &amp; other prayers. How be it in lōge processe he dyed, whan he had languysshedde from the begynnynge of August tyl the .viii. day of Ianuary. Upon whiche day he dyed, whan he had reygned .iiii. yeres &amp; .vii. monethes &amp; odde dayes / leuynge after hym none heyre male / wherfore the crowne dyscēded vnto his brother Charles erle of the Marches.

After whiche solempnyte fynysshed &amp; ended / he in short proces of tyme after sent vnto the .xxii. Iohan than pope, &amp; assertayned hym of ye gossyprede yt was atwene hym and Blanche his wyfe. wherof the examynacyon by ye sayd pope was commytted vnto the bisshoppes of Paris &amp; of Beauuais, &amp; mayster Godfrey de Blessys prothonotayr of the countre of Rome. The whiche after due and perfyte examinacyon in that mater made / they founde that Mawde countesse of Artoys and mother to the fore named quene Blanche, was godmother vnto kynge Charles her husbande. Of the whiche whan they had made reporte vnto the pope / he gaue sentēce that the sayd matrymony was not legyttymat / and cōmaunded a deuorce and a separacyon to be made atwene those .ii. persones. The whiche was shortly after executed. In the seconde yere of this Charles, dyed Robert erle of Flaūdres without yssue. wherfore the sayd erledam fell into ye Frenche kynges handes / so that of it he was in processe by thagrement of the lordes of the same, put in peasyble possessyon / all be it the erle of Neuers made therunto a pretēce &amp; tytle.
                        And in this yere kynge Charles about the feest of saynt Mathewe in Septēbre, maryed his seconde wyfe named Mary the syster of the kynge

of Bohemy or Beme, and doughter of Henry erle of Lucenbourgh and late emperoure of Almayne, named in the lyne of the emperours Henry the .viii, or after some wryters ye .vii. Also in y• sayd yere one named Iourdan of the Ile / a Gascoyne borne, &amp; a man of noble lynage but lowe &amp; vyle of condycyons, to whom the foresaid pope Iohn̄ in maryage hadde gyuen hys nyese for reuerence of his byrth / thys season by the meane of his vyle condycyons and suche dyshoneste cō
                           panye as he drewe vntyll hym, he fell into many sclaūderous vyces / so that lastly he was accused of rape &amp; murder and of felony. Of the whych he was at length in .xviii. artycles by due profe made cōuycte by the lawe, and iudged to be hanged. But the kynge at the request of the pope and for the honoure of hys blode / graunted to hym a charter, and pardoned hym of all former transgressyons. But that not wythstandynge he in processe of tyme fell or retourned vnto hys olde accustomyd condicyons. And among other greate crymes by hym executed / he slewe a sergeaunt of armys belongynge to the kynge, that to hym was sent in message. For whyche murder and other detestable dedys, he was newely accused / and vppon that somonyd to apere at Parys before the kynge and hys counsayle. At whych day of apparence he came to the sayde cytye wyth a great companye, and some noble men whiche were to hym nere of kynne / and excused him to the vttermost of theyr powers. But agayne hym and to accuse hym came many other lordes &amp; barons. Of the whyche the marques of Ampton or Dampton wyth hys sonne were chyefe, that put causes of complaynt agayne hym. The which made suche prouys and declaracyōs agayne the sayde Iourdan, that he was cōmytted vnto the chastelet of Parys, &amp; there to remayne as a prysoner. And in processe of tyme suche maters and trespaces were prouyd vpon hym, that he by authoryte of a parlyament holden at Compeyng was lastly iudged to dye. And soone after, that is to meane the .vii. day of Maye, he was drawyn to the gybbet of Parys and there hanged. In the thyrde yere of his reygne / thys Charlys gaue vnto the erle of Neuers yt before tyme hadde made clayme to the erledome of Flaunders, y• sayde erledom / the whyche of the Flemynges and inhabytauntes of that coū
                           trey was wel and ioyously receyued. Than he in shorte whyle after gaue vnto the townes of Gaunt, Brugys, Ipre, and other, dyuers pryuyleges and grauntes to theyr great auauntage &amp; profyte. But it was not longe after that he wanne of them as mych grudge and hatred as he to fore had loue &amp; good wyll. And all for a taxe yt he set vpon the dwellers of Brugys and the coūtrey nere there vnto / and specyally of them that dwelled in the countrey. For they thought yt theyr charge exceded farre the charge of ye dwellers within the towne. wherfore by secrete meanys they appoynted a daye of assemble amonge them selfe / and sodeynly well armed entred the towne of Brugys, and slewe therin dyuers of the erles seruauntes, and some of the borough maysters of the sayde towne, suche as they suspected to be of counseyle of the leuyenge of the sayd taske. In the .iiii. yere of his reygne, thys Charlys after the dethe of Mary hys seconde wyfe, by dyspensacion of the pope the .xxii. Iohn̄ / he maryed Iane his cosyn Germayn the doughter of Lewys erle of Euroux, and vncle vnto thys kynge Charlys, or brother to hys father Phylyppe le Beawe.
                        
                           IN this abouesayd .iiii. yere / the quene of Englande and syster vnto thys kyng Charlys of Fraūce, to treate an vnite and peace bytwene hyr lorde and hyr brother, for the warre made in Gascoyne, as before is towched in the .xv. yere of Edward the seconde hyr lorde and husbande / and there taryed, and retourned, as aboue in the sayde yere is expressed.
                        In thys yere also the erle of Flaū
                           ders fore named, for suspeccyon that he hadde to Robert of Flaūders hys vncle, leste he for hys synguler auaū
                           tage wold supplant hym of that erle dome / he made letters vnto the gouernours of the towne, where ye sayd Robert was resyaunt and abydyng, that they shulde put hym to dethe. But by the warnyng of his olde and trusty frende the erlys chaūcellour / he was warned and so auoyded that towne. For thys, greate malyce and rancoure arose bytwene this Robert and the erle, whyche was not shortly pacyfyed. But it was not longe after that a nother taske or imposycyon was leuyed of the townes of Gaunt, Brugys, Ipre, and other townys of Flaunders. The whyche taske was leuyed in recompensemēt of suche warres made vpon Flaunders by Phylyp le Beawe / or more dyrectely for paymēt of twelue thousand pownde awardyd by Ioselyn the cardynall, as before is shewed in the seconde yere of the .v. Phylyppe, that the Flemynges shulde paye to the French kyng for byenge of theyr peace. Of thys taske to be leuyers or gaderers was assygned the pryncypall men of the sayde townes / yt whiche by theyr demeanure in the leuyenge therof demeaned them in suche wyse, that they ranne in great hatred of the comon people. In so myche that they accusyd theym and sayde that they hadde leuyed or gatheryd moche more than the sayde taske amounted. wherfore they desyred of the erlys counsayle, that the sayde persons myghte be called to accoūpt. But thys requeste myght not be opteyned / whyche caused the comons to runne in further grudge and murmure. An other thynge also caused suspeccyon / for the erlys counsayle and the sayde collectours hadde so many secrete assembles. At lengthe whan the erlys counsayle apperceyued the murmure of the comons / they wyth the collectours condyscendyd for a trayne, to haue taken certeyne capytaynes of the sayd comōs / and sayde that at Turnaye at a daye assygned, the sayd collectours shuld yelde vp theyr accoumpte. At whych daye the erle in proper persone came vnto the sayde towne of Tournaye. And there whan ye erle with the other of hys counceyle shulde haue executed theyr purposed enter / how it was by some warnyng or monycyon that the comons had, they wythstode the erle and hys companye, and in the ende slewe many of theyr enemyes / and toke the erle and putte hym in sure kepynge wythin the towne of Brugys. But in thys skyrmysshe by meane of ye erlys party, a great part of the foresayde towne was brent. wherfore the towne toke partye with the Flemynges / and were a greate cause that the erle was so taken and putte frome hys entent. Than the foresayde comons to the more dyspleasure of the erle / admytted for theyr lorde and capytayne Roberte the vncle of the erle foresayde / and amonge them reputed hym for erle of Flaunders. The whyche for takynge vpon hym delyuered frō pryson hys frende the erlys chauncellour, whyche as aboue is sayde had delyuered hym from former daūger, &amp; made hym chyefe of his counceyle.

But to all thys was the towne of Gaunt repugnaūt / in so moche that mortall warre beganne to sourde betwene the sayd towne &amp; the towne of Bruges &amp; other. And so farfourth cō
                           tynued / that shortly after the people of Gaunt and of the other townes, met wyth them of Bruges in playne batayll, &amp; fought cruelly. But in the ende they of Gaūt chased thē of Bruges / and slewe of them beyonde fyue hundreth men. But yet the erle was neuer the rather deliuered. After this the Frenche kyng sent vnto them of Bruges, requyryng them in curtoyse maner that they wolde set theyr erle at lybertye. But they sent the messangers agayne wythout spede of theyr message.
                        In thys whyle dyed Charles de Ualoys brother vnto Phylyppe le Beaw, &amp; vncle vnto this kyng Charles / the whych languysshed longe in a consumpcyō or he dyed / in so moch that the opynyon of the people was, yt he was so punysshed for the iniury &amp; malyce yt he bare towarde Enguerram / the whyche as ye haue before harde in the fyrste yere of thys kyng, was put vnto deth. And the rather thys fame ran vpon the sayd Charles / for so moche as in ye tyme of hys syckenes, he gaue great almesse. And to suche persones as he gaue or sente hys almesse vnto / he wylled them as well to pray for the soule of the sayde Enguerram as for hys owne hele. Thys Charles de Ualoyes left after hym a sonne named Philipe de Ualoyes / the whych Phylip for so moch as thys Charles now kyng of fraūce dyed wythout issue, he by fauoure of the lordes of that regyon was made kyng of Fraunce / &amp; put by the ryght and tytle of Edwarde the thyrde thā kyng of Englande, the sonne of Isabel &amp; doughter of Phylyp le Beawe. whych Isabell by dyssent was rightful enheritour of ye crowne of Fraūce For whyche tytle was after cruell warre betwene the sayd Edwarde &amp; Phylyp, as in the story of the sayde Edwarde after shall appere. In the v. yere of kyng Charles the Burghmaysters &amp; skepyns, yt is to meane the rulers of the towne of Bruges / deliuered theyr erle &amp; set hym at larg vpon certayne condicions folowyng the whych to be obserued they caused hym to be solēply sworne. Fyrste that after that day he shuld nat punysshe nor hurt any of the lande of Flaundres, for any displeasure to hym done or any of hys seruauntes or councel, sen the tyme that he was erle, concernyng any cause of theyr rebellion. Secūdaryly yt he shuld nat abrydge nor mynysshe any of theyr lyberties that they of olde tyme haue had, or by hym newly to theym graunted. Thyrdely, that in all grose maters that concerned the gouernaunce of hys realme / suche as he knewe well dyuerse of them to be expert therein, that he shulde nothynge conclude or do without theyr aduyces and assentys. And fourthly that after that day he shuld neuer vse the counsayl of the abbot of Uersellay / which they knew for theyr dedely enemy, for so moche as they before tyme had slayne hys father named Petyr Floce or Floze in the batayll of Courtray as in the syxtene yere of Phylyppe le Beawe is before shewed, how be it the name of the sayde Petyr is nat there expressed. After whyche artycles wyth other fermely by the erle promysed to be kept and holden / he was deliuered &amp; set at large.
                        In the syxte yere of the reygne of thys Charles / a greate dyssencyon and varyaunce aroose betwene the Dolphyne of Uyen and the duke of Sauoy / so that mortall batayll ensued vppon the same. In the whyche

moche people were slayne vpon both partyes. But in y• ende the Dolphyn of Uyen had the better / and toke as prysoners in the feelde the duke of Burgoyne and the erle of Ancerne, wyth other noble men. In thys yere also the Gascoynes with ye Englissh men made warre vppon the borders of Fraunce. Agayne whome kynge Charles sent a cosyn of hys, named syr Alphons de Spayne. But he spēt the kyng greate good, and retourned with lytle worshyppe into Fraunce, where he dyed shortely after. Then the kynge sent agayne the sayd Gascoynes the erle of Ewe, &amp; syr Robert Barthram than marshall of Fraūce, with dyuerse other noble men. In whyche season the Gascoynes wyth the sayd Englysshemen had gotten the castell of a towne standynge in y• coūtre of Poytyew or Poytyers named saynt Oyngne / within whyche towne the sayd erle &amp; other the nobles of Fraūce were lodged / so yt betwene them dayly cruell assautes were exercysed, to the great hurte of bothe partyes. Lastly betwene thē was a daye of batayll in playne feelde accorded / where the Frenchemen to the entēt to haue the aduaūtage of the sayd feeld &amp; there to enbatayll thē selfe to theyr mooste auaūtage / the day of the sayd appoytemēt issued of yt towne, &amp; yode to the place assygned, whyche was a good dystaunce frome the foresayde towne, &amp; there taryed theyr enemyes. But the Gascoynes entendyng an other purpose, yode streyght vnto yt foresayde towne / and knowyng it to be without greate defence, assauted and shortly gatte it and set it on fyre nat sparynge chyrches nor other places of relygyon as affermeth y• frēch boke / and that done retourned vnto the fyresayd castel, and in processe of tyme after retourned agayne into Guyan. whan kynge Charles was assertayned of thys delusion / he was greuously dyscontented agayne the Gascoynes, and manysshed theym very sore. But in the moneth of Decē
                           bre shortly ensuynge, he was taken with a greuouse sykenesse / so that he dyed vppon Candelmas euyn folowynge at Boys in Uyncent, and was entered at saynt Denyse whā he had reygned fyue yeres and odde dayes / leuynge after hym none heyre of hys body, excepte the quene was than wyth chylde. whyche chylde dyed soone after ye byrthe. wherfore some questions for that kyngedome were moued as before touched in the ende of the fourthe yere of thys Charles, &amp; after shalbe forther expressed.

                           EDwarde the .iii. of that name, &amp; sonn̄ of Edward the seconde, and of Isabell ye alonely doughter &amp; chylde of Phylip le Beawe or Phylyppe the fayre, father to Charles laste kynge of Fraunce / beganne to reygne as kynge of Englande his father yet lyuynge, the syx &amp; twenty daye of Ianuary, in the ende of the yere of grace a thousande thre hundreth and syx and twenty, and the fourth yere of Charles the fyfth last kynge of Fraunce / and was crowned at westmynster vppon the daye of the puryfycacyon of oure Lady nexte ensuynge.
                        In hys begynnynge came forthe plentye and gracyous happes / for the erthe tooke plentye, the ayre tempoure, the see quyetnesse, and to the chyrche grewe peace.
                        
                           In thys fyrste yere he confermed the lybertyes and fraunchyses of ye cytye of London / and ordeyned that the mayre for the tyme beyng shuld sytte in all places of iugement within the lyberty of the same for chiefe iustyce, the kynges persone onely excepte / &amp; that euery alderman that hadde ben mayre shuld be iustyce of peace in all London and Myddelsex / &amp; eueryche alderman that hadde not be mayre shulde be iustyce of peace wythin his owne warde. And also he graunted to the cytezyns the fee ferme of London for .iii. hundreth pownde / &amp; that they shulde not be constrayned to go out of the cytye to fyghte or defende the land for any nede. Also that after that daye the fraunchyse of the cytye shulde not be seasyd into the kynges handes / but onely for treason or rebellyon done by the hole cytye. And Southwerke was admytted to be vnder the correccyon and rule of the citye / and the mayre of London to be baylyffe of Southwerke / and the mayre to chose &amp; ordeyne such a baylyffe of that borough as hym lyked / whiche ordinaunce endureth to this day. In the moneth of Apryll, for so mych as meanes were made by the frere prechours or the blacke freres, for the delyuery of kynge Edwarde the .ii. out of pryson / therfore he was had out of the castell of Kenelworth, &amp; cōueyed vnto ye castel of Berkeley. where after about saynt Mathewys tyde the sayde Edward by y• meanes of syr Roger Mortimer was myserably slayne.

I fynde expressed. And fyrste was layed vnto hys charge, that by hys meanes syr Edwarde of Carnaruan by mooste tyrrannouse deth in the castell of Barkley was murdered. Secundaryly that to the kynges great dyshonoure &amp; dammage, the Scottes by hys meanes &amp; treason escaped frō the kyng at ye parke on Stāhope whych then shuld haue fallen in the kynges daūger, ne had ben yt fauour of the sayd Roger to thē thā shewed. Thyrdely to hym was layed, that he for execuciō of the sayd treason, receyued of ye capytayne of the sayd Scottes named syr Iames Dowglas, great summes of money. And also for lyke mede, he had to the kynges great dyshonoure and hurte of hys realme, concluded a peace betwene ye kyng and the Scottes / &amp; caused to be delyuered vnto theym the charter or endenture called Ragman, wyth many other thynges to the Scottes great aduaūtage &amp; inpouerysshyng of this realme of Englād. Fourthlye was layed to hym, that where by synystre &amp; vnlefull meanes contrary yt kynges pleasure &amp; wyll, or assente of the lordes of the kynges counsayl, he had gotten into hys possessyō moche of the kynges treasoure / he vnskylfully wasted &amp; mysspent it. By reason wherof the kyng was in necessyte, &amp; dryuen parforce to assaye his frēdes. Fyfthlie, that he also had enpropered vnto hym dyuerse wardes belōgyng to the kyng, to hys great lucre &amp; the kynges great hurt / and that he was more secrete with quene Isabell the kynges mother, than was to goddes pleasure or the kynges honour. The whych artycles wyth other agayne hym proued / he was by auctoryte of the sayd parlyament iuged to dethe. And vpō saynt Andrewes euyn next ensuyng, at London he was drawen &amp; hanged. About the begynnynge of August folowyng syr Edwarde Bayloll the sonne of syr Iohan Bayloll some tyme kynge of Scottes, by meanes before purchased, opteyned suche fauoure that wyth the ayde of syr Henry Beawmoūt, syr Dauyd of Stroley, syr Geffery Moubray, and wyth the ayde of .ii.M. Englysshemē entred into Scotlād by water / wher in short space drew vnto thē such multitude of scottes, yt the sayd Edwarde was lord of a greate hoste / &amp; so kepte on his way tyll he came to a place called Gledismore, or after some writers Crakismoore. where he was encountred of ye power of Scotlād, &amp; fought there a cruell batayl, in ye which were slayn a great multitude of Scottes. By reason of whych victorie he was crowned kyng of scottes at yt towne of Scone shortly after. And shortly after he mette wyth kynge Edward at the towne of Newe castell, and there vnto hym made hys homage &amp; feawty for the lande of Scotlāde.

                     The kynge of Fraunce thys yere for so moche as he was credybly enfourmed, that kyng Edwarde wolde entre the lande of Fraūce, &amp; to make warre vpō thesame, he therfore made great purueyaunce to resyste hym. For the cōmon fame ranne thanne in Fraūce, yt kyng Edward entēded nat onely to clayme Gascoyne &amp; Guyan, but also all Fraunce as hys propre &amp; rightfull enherytaunce in the ryghte of hys mother. wherefore the French kynge assembled an huge hoste, and commytted the rule of it vnto the kynge of Nauerne, and to the erle of Alenson brother vnto the sayde Frenche kynge▪ whyche sayde capytaynes wyth theyr people awayted dayly the kynge of Englandes commynge / whyche theym for that yere dyspoynted. But as testyfyeth the same Frenche cronycle / kynge Edwarde in thys whyle sent into Flaunders a knyghte called syr Barnarde de Brette, for to treate of an amy

                        e betwene hym and the Flemynges. For this cause, the erle of Flaunders whych was very fast with the Frēch kynge, called hys counsayll to hym, to haue theyr aduyce howe he myght beste ordre hym selfe and hys people. In whych coūsayll were dyuers opynyons / so that many thoughte it better for dyuerse consyderacyons / whyche were longe to reherce, that the erle shulde rather preferre the amyte of the kynge of Englande thā of the kynge of Fraunce. Of whyche opynyon was a greate furtherer or promoter a knyghte of Flaunders called Countryssye▪ wyth whome the erle beynge for that cause discontent sent hym to pryson. And soone after at the request of the Frenche kynge, whyche layed vnto hys charge that he hadde receyued greate summes of money of the kyng of Englande, for to procure and styre the Flemynges agayne hym / he was behedded, for whyche dede the dwellers of Gaunte and of Bruges were so miscontente, that they vtterly refused ye erle &amp; hys counsayll, &amp; made theym stronge to withstande hys displeasure. Than ye erle was constrayned to gather hys lordes &amp; knyghtes, for the more part of ye cōmons were agayne hym. And in short proces after met in playn batayll ī a place called Marchie / where after lōge fyghte, the erle &amp; his holte was put to flyghte; &amp; forced for hys safegard to take a castel named Mal or Malet. In which season kyng Edward beynge enfourmed of ye amytie yt the Flemynges bare towarde hym anon sent vnto them a knyght called

syr Galtyer or walter de Magny, with a goodly company of archers well apoynted / the whyche arryued in an ile called than Cazāter. whome the erle of Flaunders with a certayn of hys knyghtes encountred, &amp; gaue vnto the Englysshemen batayl. But in the ende the erle was shamefully chased, and many of hys gentylmen slayne and takē / as syr Iohn̄ Rodes syr wyllyā Gyll, syr Nycholas Chaū
                        cy, with many other slayne. And syr Guy bastarde brother vnto the erle, with dyuerse other taken / of yt which some were sent as prysoners into Englande.
                     whan the Frenche kyng had vnderstandynge of the deuysyon that was betwene the erle and hys subiectes, &amp; how faythfull ye erle was vnto hym, entendynge to wynne by fayre meanes the fauour of ye Flemynges, whyche he knewe well he myght nat wynne by rygoure. Than he sente vnto Gaūt the bysshop of saynt Denys with other / whych made vnto ye rulers of ye towne &amp; of Bruges and other townes there assembled, many fayre behestes &amp; promyses.

But all was in vayn. For kyng Edward had so sped hys nedes with thē, by the meanes of one named Iaques de artiuele a mā of Gaūt, which was of great substaūce, &amp; passyng other in boldenes &amp; capacyte of wytte &amp; discreciō yt the sayd towne of Gaūt with Bruges, Ipre, Courtryke or Courtrey, Cassyle, and other there about, condyssended and promysed ioyntly and hooly, to refuse ye Frēche kynge, &amp; to take the kynge of Englandes partye / and the rather for the warre whych before tyme Philip de Ualoyes made vpon them in the begynnyng of hys reygne, as in ye fyrst yere of the story of the sayde Phylyp shall after appere.

And at myd somer vppon saynte Iohn̄s euyn he fought with the frēch kynges nauy, whyche lay in a wayte for hym nere to the towne called the Sluse. Of thys nauy whyche were in noumber by the reporte of the frēche boke vpō iiii.C. sayles, wherof were chyefe admyralles syr Hugh Queret, &amp; syr Nycholas Buchet, &amp; one named Barbe Noyre or in Englysh Blacke berde / the whych capytayns or admyralles anone as they espied ye englyssh flote they made towarde thē to begyn the fyght .iiii. galeys set vpō a shyppe of auaūtage which sayled before ye other named ye ryche Oliuer / the which .iiii galeys the fore named Barbe Noyre had the cunduyt of / &amp; assayled thys sayd shyppe on euery parte, &amp; bet her with gunneshot &amp; her men with hayl shot excedyngely / so that of the men within her were many slayn and mo woūded, &amp; lykely to haue ben shortly won ne had bē the rescous of her cō

And by his great conforte / ye Frenchemen were chased, and many of theyr shyppes bowged &amp; taken with many prysoners in them. Amonge the whiche the forenamed admyralles or capytaynes, syr Nycholas Buchet &amp; syr Hugh Queret were .ii / the whiche in despyte of the Frenchemen were hanged vpon ye sayles of theyr shyppes, which they were takē in. And amōge the shyppes that were at this season taken, were recouered the .ii. foresayd shyppes named the Edwarde and ye Crystofer / the whiche before were taken by the Frenchemen, as it before is shewed in ye .iii. yere of this kynge. In this batayle also as is testyfyed of many and dyuerse wryters, were slayne vpon the noumber of .xxx.M. Frenchemen / al be it ye Frenche boke nameth so many to be slayne vpon bothe partyes / &amp; excuse this mysfortune by the neglygence of syr Nycholas Buchet, whiche kepte the Frēche nauy so longe within the hauen, that they were so closed in with the Englysh nauy, yt a great noūbre of them myght neuer stryke stroke nor shote theyr ordenaunce, but to the hurte of theyr owne company. whā kynge Edwarde had optayned this tryumphaunt vyctory of his enmyes, he yelded great thākes vnto god. How be it he was fayne to tary a season with in his shyppe, by reason of a woūde ye which he had receyued in his thyghe. In whiche season ye quene his wyfe came to vysyte hym, and retourned agayne vnto Gaūt. And after a fewe dayes passed / ye kynge departed from Swynne, &amp; rode vnto our lady of Ardenbourghe / &amp; sent his nauy in the nexte hauen to Brugys, &amp; moche of his people vnto the towne of Gaūt. And whā he had accōplished his pylgrymage, he rode vnto Brugys, and from thense vnto Gaūt / where of the dwellers he was ioyously receyued. Than kynge Edwarde there called a great counsayle / by the whiche it was determyned that he shulde prepare .ii. hostes / wherof yt one shuld be of ye mē of Gaūt &amp; of ye townes there aboute, of ye which certayne lordes of Almayne shuld haue ye rule / &amp; ye other hoste shulde be of mē of Brugys &amp; of Englyssh archers / &amp; of ye host was ordeyned syr Robert of Artoys to be leder &amp; capitayne. whā ye sayd .ii. hostes were all garnysshed with all thynge for thē nedeful / ye fyrst of them was sent vnto ye town of Turney, and the other vnto ye towne of saynt Omers. The which .ii. townes at ye day were lyke strēgth vnto Fraūce, as Calays is now vnto England. wherfore the Frēch kynge for the more suretye of them, sent vnto Tournay the erle of Foys &amp; syr Barthā than marshall of Fraūce, with .iiii.M. men of armis, &amp; vnto saynt Omers he sent ye duke of Burgoyn with a great cōpany of lordes &amp; other. whā sir Robert of Artois had lyen a certeyn tyme before saynt Omers, &amp; many sharpe assautys by

hym and his people had ben gyuen to it, in the whiche dyuerse fortunes fell &amp; chaunces of warre, which were tedyous and longe to wryte / fynally vpon the morowe after saynt Iames day or the .xxvi. day of Iulii / ye duke of Burgoyne with his retynue yssued out of the towne, &amp; foughte with ye sayd syr Robert &amp; his people a lōge season. In ye which fyght was slayne of the dukes partye the lorde of Hamelcourte, syr Froysard de Beaford, the lorde of saynt Uran a lorde of Spayne, &amp; a Burgonyon lorde called the lorde of Branges, with other dyuerse knyghtes and gentylmen to the noūber of .liiii. as sayth ye Frēche cronycle / and of the comune people vpon .iii.M. But in short tyme after the power of the duke encreased in suche wyse, that syr Robert with his cōpany was fayne to departe thense, and so yode into Ipre, &amp; there helde hym. Then as aboue is sayde when kynge Edwarde had sent forth ye fore named .ii. hostes / he with the rest of his people yode vnto a place within .ii. Englysshe myles of Tournaye called in Frēche le Pount de Pree / and there lodged hym &amp; his people. And Phylyp de Ualoys ye Frēche kynge, came with his people vnto an house of relegyon, whiche then was called ye priory of saynt Andrewe. At which two places these two sayde prynces thus lyenge with great strengthes vpon eyther syde / kyng Edwarde by counsceyll of his lordes sent vnto ye Frenche kynge a letter, conteynynge as foloweth.

And for that we se well that ye entende to perseuer in youre iniuryous witholdynge without to do vnto vs reason / for our ryght to demaūde we are entred into our lāde of Flaundres as souerayne lorde of the same, and passe by that countre / doynge you ferther to vnderstande, that we haue taken with the helpe of our lorde Iesu chryst the ryght, with the power of the sayd countrey, and with our people them allyed / beholdynge the ryght, which we haue in ye herytage that ye wythholde frome vs with great wronge / and drawe vs towarde you to make a short ende vppon our ryghtfull demaunde and chalenge, yf ye wyll towarde vs approche. And for so moch that so great power of mē of Armes that came vpon our partyes, may not longe holde thē togythers without great destruccyon of ye people. whiche euery good crysten man ought to eschewe / &amp; specyally a prynce or other that haue the gouernaunce of people. we therfore moche desyre, yt in shorte dayes they may mete.

And in that that ye thynke to haue the Flemynges in your ayde / we thynke vs to be assured, that the good townes and the commons wyll behaue theym in suche wyse agayne vs, and agayne our cosyn the erle of Flaunders, that they wyll saue theyr honoure and trouthe. And in that that they haue mysse done tyll nowe, hathe ben by euyll counsayl of suche people which regarde nat the common weale of the people, but of theyr owne profyte onely.

                     It was nat longe after that the Frenche kynge hadde thus rescribed vnto kyng Edwarde, but that a messynger came vnto hym frome Tourney for hasty rescouse / for the towne was dayly and sharplye assauted of the Englysshe hoste. wherefore in all haste he sente thyther the duke of Athenesse, the vycounte of Thonart, the vycount of Dannaye / with dyuerse other to ye noūber of .xv. men of name, with great noūber of peple.
                     
                        The whych sped thē streyght vnto ye mount of Cassyle. But or they came the sayd mount was gotten by ye Flemynges, so that of theyr lodgynge they were dyspoynted. By reason wherof they fered to set vpon the Englysshe hoste, or yet to trauayll for ye remouyng of the sayd syege of Tourney / but toke theyr counceyll &amp; swar

                     In thys meane whyle kyng Philip counsayled with hys lordes, whether it were better for hym to drawe towarde Tourney to remoue ye siege or to go into Flaunders and to make warre vpon the townes that helde with kyng Edwarde. By whych coū
                        sayll it was thought moste honorable, that he shulde endeuer hym selfe to remoue ye sayd syege. After whiche conclusiō so taken / he with hys hoste drewe towarde Tourney / and in the ende lodged hym and hys people at a place or towne called at that daye Bowyns, within .iii. myles of Tourney, in whose cōpany was ye kynge of Nauerne, the kynge of Bohemy or Beame, the dukes of Normandy, &amp; of Loreyne, &amp; of Athenesse or Athēs, the erles of Alensone, of Flaunders, and of Sauoy / with other to the noū
                        bre of .xiiii. erles, besyde vycountes, baronettes and knyghtes to a great noumbre. And with kynge Edwarde were these lordes folowynge / the erle of Herford, the erles of Northamptō of Derbye, of Southāpton, of Oxynforde, of Henawd, of Harflete, and of rondell. Also of straungers, the duke of Geldre, and of Sclauonye, &amp; Brabant / with many other vycountes, banerettes, and knyghtes whych I passe ouer. And thus laye these two prynces with two great and myghty hostes within fyue myles, withoute great batayll or fyghte a certayne of tyme. But euer in meane whyle the towne of Tourney was assayled of ye Englysshe men and Flemynges / the whych defended them manfully and well. In the whyche passe tyme the countesse of Henaude whyche was mother vnto the quene of Englāde, and as testyfyeth the Frenche cronycle syster vnto the Frenche kynge, a woman of passynge discrecyon and eloquency, with ye ayde of other prynces as the kyng of Beame and other laboured suche a meane of treaty, yt a daye of dyet was betwene the two kynges appoynted / all be it that dyuerse of kyng Edwardes counsayll were sore agayne it, and specyally Iakes de Artyuele. Than for kyng Edwardes party was assygned the bysshoppe of Lyncolne, syr Geffrey Scrope, syr Iohn̄ of Henaude brother to the erle, &amp; syr wyllyā Cheyny wyth other. And for the Frēche kyng was assygned the kynge of Beame, the erles of Armenake &amp; of Sauoy, syr Lewys de Sauoy and other. And to the ende that thys appoyntement myght take the better effecte / a daye of trewce was concluded tyll mydsomer folowynge. But moste wryters testyfyen that kynge Edwarde lefte the syege before Tourney, for defaut of money and neglygēce of his slowe procuratours in Englāde, that sped nat hys nedes there as they shulde. For that one cause and for that other the kynge with hys hoste departed thense vnto Gaunt, and taryed there a certayne of tyme. In whych season the fore named lordes and knyghtes met at Tournay / and there debated the maters of chalenge of kynge Edwarde, and certayn artycles concernynge the countrey of Flaunders. In whyche counsayll it was graūted by the Frenche kynges partye, that ye
                        
Frenche kynge shulde frely departe towarde the maryage of kynge Edwardes chyldren, with the hole seygnoryes of Gascoyn and Guyan, and the erledome of Poytyers, in so fre maner that no offycer of the French kyng shuld medle or haue to do with in any parte of those lordshyppes. And for Flaūders it was by the sayd lordes graunted, that the commons of that coūtrey in all customes and lawes shuld be iuged &amp; ruled as they of olde tymes had vsed / and also that all bondes and oblygacyons that in tymes passed the chyefe townes had made to the Frenche kynge for any cause, shulde be cancelled and delyuered. And of theyr erle they shulde be acquyted in lyke wyse, for all offē
                        ces done before that day. Also all censuryes or curses yt they before were wrapped in, shulde be clerelye adnulled &amp; reuoked, with other cōclusions and offers, whych I passe ouer.

In thys yere also were sent from ye .xii. Benet thā pope two cardynalles, to treate of a peace betwene the kynges of Englande &amp; of Fraunce.

                     In the whyche tyme the sayde syr Godfrey brent &amp; spoyled the coūtrey of Cōstantyne there nere adioynyng. Than kyng Edward departed frō ye foresayd towne, &amp; went vnto a strōge towne called Karenten or Karenton / the whyche he gate wyth the castell

to the same belongynge. And so continued his iourney, yt vpō the .xx. day of ye sayde moneth of Iule, he layed hys syege before the cytye or towne of Caen. wherin were at ye daye chyef capytaynes, the bysshop of Bayen, ye erle of Ewe, the lorde of Turnebu, wyth other dyuerse knyghtes &amp; men of name. Than kyng Edwarde commaunded that the sayd towne shulde be assayled / ye whych was done with so great force, &amp; specyally with suche stronge and cōtynuall shot, that the Frenchmē forsoke the wallys &amp; drew them towarde the castell. And in processe after longe &amp; cruell fyght, ye Englysshemen entred the towne, &amp; there toke prysoners. Amonge the whyche there was taken ye cōstable of Fraūce &amp; the kynges chaūberleyne.Cane conquered. Than the Englysshemen spoyled and pylled the towne of Caen / and bare the pyllage vnto theyr shyppes, whyche after was conueyed by them into Englande. whan kynge Edwarde had thus spoyled and brent a parte of the towne of Caen, &amp; forced the bysshope of Bayen &amp; the other capytaynes to take the castell for theyr refuge / considerynge the strength of the same he departed thens, and so sped hym towarde the cytye of Roan chefe &amp; princypall cytye of Normandye. But the Frenche kynge with a greate power was in thys whyle comē vnto Roan̄, &amp; had broken the brydges, and stopped the passages in suche wyse, that kynge Edwarde was fayne to leue ye way / so that he costed toward Parys and came to a stronge towne called Uernon, &amp; from thens to a towne named Amyrlene / at whych townes he was resysted &amp; loste some of hys soudyours. And the .xii. daye of Auguste he came to a towne named Poysy, &amp; taryed there .vi. dayes / and from thēs yode vnto saynt Germayn. And euer syr Godfrey de Harcourt byeng in ye vawarde, brent the townes &amp; spoyled the coūtrey as he went
                     And lyke as kyng Edwarde with hys hoste thus passed the coūtrey towarde Parys / so in lyke maner the Frenche kynge with hys power, passed or helde hys way towarde ye sayd cytye / beynge so nere sundry tymes, that eyther hoste had syght of other. But the ryuer of Seyne was euer betwene them, so that for it they myght nat ioyne in batayll. whan kyng Edwarde was comyn to a towne called saynt Clowe / he set fyre therin, which was sene vnto Parys. whyche put ye cytezeyns in great fere, in so moch as wytnesseth the Frēch cronycle, that if the Frēch kyng had nat ben there present / the cytye shulde haue be yelden vnto kyng Edwarde. Thā kyng Edward seynge he myght nat passe the ryuer of Seyn towarde ye citie of Parys, occupyed all ye chefe palaysys &amp; royall Manours, where the Frenche kynges were accustomed for to soiourne and lye at / &amp; dranke the wyne &amp; occupyed suche stuffe &amp; necessaryes as he there fande. And at hys departyng set fyre vpō them, &amp; cōsumed the more parte of them. As at poyzy one, at saynt Germayne an other, and at Mount Ioy the thyrde / &amp; brente the towne of Poyzy, reseruyng an house of nunnes, whyche was founded by Phylyp le Beawe father vnto kyng Edwardes wyfe. Here ye shal vnder stāde that the auctours or wryters fauoureth theyr owne nacyon.Affeccyō of Historiographers. For the Englysshe wryters say, that ye Frēch kyng fledde / &amp; brake the brydges as he went, to the ende that the Englysh hoste shuld nat wynne to the French men to gyue vnto thē batayll. And ye Frenche boke sayeth, that kynge Edwarde fled, &amp; wolde nat abyde batayl with the Frenche men / wherefore the Frēch kyng brake the brydges to the entent that ye Englyssh mē shuld nat

escape hys daūger. But howe it was as sayth an other wryter called Iohn̄ Froysarde / the commons of Fraūce thought it a greate dyshonoure vnto all the lande, that the Englyssh hoste shuld so passe thorough the harte or myddell of Fraunce / and to occupye the kynges chief lodgynges, &amp; nat to be foughten with of all that season. whych myght nat be after the opiniō of the sayd common people, wythout great treason of suche as were nere about the kyng. Thā kyng Edward was so closed by reason of brekynge of brydges, yt he was forced to drawe backe, and to reedyfye the brydge of Poyzy. The whiche was repayred in so stronge wyse, that he &amp; hys hoste passed there ouer withoute parell. Howe be it that in the tyme of repayrynge of it, the French kyng sent thyder .ii.M. men to let the sayde werke. But the archers kept theym of wyth theyr shot, in so sharpe maner, that ye more partye of them was slayne, and the werke ꝑfyghted as aboue is sayd Than kyng Edwarde entred the coū

In thys whyle kyng Edward with baner dysplayed came vnto the cytye of Beauuayze, &amp; assayled the towne. But the towne was wel garnisshed with soudyours which defēded theyr enemyes vygourously. wherfore kynge Edwarde cō
                        syderynge, he myghte nat lyghtely wynne that towne, sette the bulwerkes on fyre / and so departed thens, &amp; yode vnto a place called in Frenche Soygnouile or Blāke Tache. where he passed the water of Sum vpon a frydaye the .xxv. daye of August, and lodged hym &amp; hys people nere vnto a forest called Cressy or Crecy. wherof whan the French kyng was ware anone he sped hym frome the fore named towne of Antoygne vnto Aubeuyle agayne. where after he hadde refresshed hym and hys people, he rode vnto an abbey faste by the forenamed towne of Cressy.
                     In thys passe tyme, Iohn̄ duke of Normandy and sonne of Phylyp de Ualoys, whyche as in the precedyng yere is towched, layd hys syege vnto the castell of Aguyllon, herynge that hys father was thus warreyed wyth the kyng of Englande / brake vp his syege, and came with hys strengthe vnto hys father.
                     THese .ii. greate hostes thus lodged within lytle compasse, nere vnto the forenamed towne of Cressy / vpon the saterdaye folowyng the feaste of saynt Bartholmewe, beynge the .xxvi. day of the monethe of August, eyther cruelly assayled other and foughte there a mortall &amp; sharpe batayll. whereof in the ende kynge Edwarde gloryouslye was victoure, and chaced the Frenche kynge / and slewe in that fyght after the sayenge of moste wryters, the kynge of Bohemy or Beame sonne of Henry ye Emperoure, vii. or the. eyght, the duke of Loreyne, the erle of Alenson brother vnto the Frēche kynge, Charles erle of Bloys, the erles of Flaunders, of Sancer, of Narcourt, and of Fyennes, wyth dyuerse other to the noumber of eyght bysshoppes and erles, &amp; xvii. lordes of name / and of banerettes, knyghtes, and esquyers, beyōde the noumber of .xvi. hūdreth / so that as concludeth the Frenche hystorye, in that batayll was slayne the floure of the Chyualrye of Fraunce, and of the cōmons vpō .viii.M. men / &amp; that the realme of Fraūce that day susteyned such confusiō, that the lyke therof had nat be sene many yeres passed / 

and yt be people and men of no reputacyon, as archers, by the vyolence of theyr importune shot, whych hors nor man myght stande agayne. Thā the Frenche kyng with a small company fledde sore hurte vnto a towne called Broy, &amp; lodged there ye nyght folowynge. And kyng Edwarde beynge warned that an other hoste of enemyes was commynge towarde hym / abode styll in the same feelde, &amp; set good watches, &amp; made great fyres thorough the hoste, and so cōtynued tyll the monday folowynge. Upon whyche day in the mornynge apered to them a new hoste of Frenche men / to the whych they gaue batayle, and slewe of them more in noumbre thā was slayne vpō the saterday before. But of capytaynes or men of name the auctor reherseth none.
                     Than kyng Edwarde gaue great thankes vnto god of his tryumphāt vyctory / and after departed frō that towne of Cressye, and toke hys waye towarde Moustruell, and from thēs to Boleyne, and lastlye to Caleys. wherof than was capytayne vnder ye Frenche kyng a Burgonyō knyght named syr Iohn̄ de Uyēne / to whom kyng Edwarde sent that he shuld delyuer vnto hym the sayde towne of Caleys. But for the kynge receyued from hym no comfortable answere / he immedyatly layde hys syege vnto the sayd towne, whych was vpon the thyrde day of the moneth of Septē
                        bre / &amp; there abode a certayn of tyme in makynge of assautes to the same. In whyche tyme and season the erle of Derby lyenge at Burdeaux, and hauynge the rule of Gascoyne and Guyan / wan dyuerse townes &amp; holdes from the Frenchemen, as the townes called Sayntez in Poyteaw saynt Iohn̄ de Angely, and ye towne of Poytyers. In the whyche he had excedyng treasoure and rychesse / soo that he &amp; hys sowdyours were greatly enryched, by the pyllage that they wan in those townes and coūtrey to them adioynaunt. And whā the sayd erle had spoyled the sayd townes, &amp; brent a greate parte of the foresayde cytye of Poytyers, and the kynges palays within the same / he than at hys pleasure retourned vnto Burdeaux.
                     In thys passe tyme also, the Frēch kyng to the entente to haste kyng Edwarde into Englande / sent Dauyd le Bruze some tyme kynge of Scottes, into ye lande with a strōge army. The which gathered vnto hym such lordes and knyghtes of Scotlande as before tymes fauoured hys party and with them entred the boundes of Northumberlande, &amp; spoyled that countrey without pyte. But it shall apere by other auctoures, that thys Dauyd le Bruze at thys daye hadde recouered the crowne of Scotlande / and that Edwarde de Bayloll was than dede, whych before was kynge. Than it foloweth whan the archebisshop of yorke with other lordes than lefte in Englande, herde tell that the Scottes were thus entred the lande anone the sayd archebysshppe, with syr Henry Perse, syr Rafe Neuyle, &amp; syr Gilbert Umfreyle knyghtes, and other gentylmen aswell spyrytuall as other, apparayled theyin in theyr best maner and sped them towarde ye Scottes / so that they mette with thē and gaue vnto them batayll vpon ye euyn of saynt Luke or the .xvii. daye of Octobre in a place faste by Durhā called at that daye Neuyles crosse. where god shewed to the Englysshe men suche grace, that they scōfyted ye Scottes, and slew of them great foyson / and toke prysoners the sayd Dauid le Bruze, syr wyllyam Dowglas syr Thōlyn Fowkys, with other of ye nobles of Scotlande / the whyche

shortely after were surely conueyed vnto the towre of London, and there kepte as prysoners.
                     whā kynge Edward from the .iii. day of Septembre as before is sayd, hadde by sondry tymes assayled the towne of Caleys, and sawe well he he might nat shortly wynne it / he prouyded for hī &amp; hys people to lye there all ye wynter folowynge / so yt for the lodging of hym &amp; his hoste, he made so many houses &amp; lodges, that it semed an other Caleys. wherfore in ꝓces of tyme duryng yt syege, of the vytelers &amp; suche as dayly resorted vnto ye kynges hoste, it was named newe Caleys. where ye kyng in proper persone abode al the wynter folowyng, &amp; the more parte of the next somer as after shall apere.

And that done he toke his leue of saint Denys about the quyndene of Pasche, and so yode vnto a towne called Hesdom̄ where he taryed the gaderyng of hys hoste, so longe that it was nere vnto the feast of mary Magdaleyn or hys people were all assembled.

                           e. Than after moste wryters, ye town of Caleys was yolden to kynge Edwarde about the ende of Septembre after the kynge had contynued there hys siege an hole yere and somedeale more. After receyte wherof he taryed in the towne vppon a moneth, &amp; voyded clene all the olde inhabytauntes and Frenchemen, and stored it wyth Englysshemen, and specyally wyth Kentyshmen. And whan he had sette that towne in a sure ordre and gydynge, and graunted a peace for .ix. monethes at the requeste of two cardynalles sente frome the forenamed pope Clement the syxte, to be holden

betwene hym and the Frenche kyng / he sayled wyth great tryumphe into Englande, and came to London aboute the feaste of saynte Romayne or the thre and twenty daye of Octobre / where he was ioyously receyued of the cytezeyns, and so cōueyed vnto westmynster.
                     In thys yere also an Englysshe knyght called syr Thomas Agorne, capytayne of the roche of Aryan before spoken of in the .xx. yere of thys kyng, was fiersly warred of syr Charles de Bloys. But after many bykerynges &amp; skyrmishes, a day of batayl was set betwene the sayd Charles &amp; Thomas.

to the Frenche kynges possessyon. Kynge Edwarde beforetyme hadde commytted one of the towres of Caleys vnto a Ianuay to whō he mych trusted. wyth the whyche Ianuay a knyght of Burgoyn named syr Godfrey de Charny, was very famylyer / in so mych that the sayd syr Godfrey at conuenyent leysex brake vnto the sayde Ianuay, for the betrayenge of ye towne of Caleys. The which gaue vnto hym lykynge answere / so that the sayd Ianuay agreed for certayn sōme of money to be payde in hande, to deliuer vnto the sayd syr Godfrey and suche other as he then shulde brynge wyth hym, the towre that he then hadde in kepynge. By meane wherof he shulde shortly after haue the rule of the towne. In tyme of dryuynge and of apoyntynge of whiche bargayne as sayth the Frenche cronycle / this Ianuay sent secrete word vnto the kynge of Englande / requyrynge hym in secrete wyse to come vnto Caleys. The whyche then holdynge hys Crystmas at Hauerynge Bower in Essex, vppon the morowe after newe yeres daye toke hys shyppynge, and landed that nyght at Caleys, in so secrete maner that fewe of the towne knewe of his there beyng.
                     whan the daye of apoyntmente of delyuery of this foresayd towre was comyn, and thys Ianuay hadde receyued hys payment / at an houre assygned bytwene the sayde syr Godfrey &amp; hym, a tokē was gyuē by thys sayde Ianuay, that the Frenchmen shulde drawe nere vnto ye sayd towre to wynne theyr pray.
                     Then the sayd syr Godfrey wyth a certayne noumber came wythin ye daūger of the towne of Caleys, warnyng ye resydue of hys cōpany that they shuld tary there tyll he were enterde ye towne / &amp; than at his sendyng to come in all spedy wyse. But so soone as the sayde syr Godfrey was nere vnto the towre, a busshment of sawdyoures were sente out at a possterne / the whiche closed hym and his Frenchemen vpon all sydes, &amp; slewe of them many. Amonge the whiche, syr Henry de Boys knyght, with syr Gautyer de Ualence, and syr Robert of Beuuays knyghtes, were slayne / And the sayd syr Godfrey taken sore wounded / and the lorde of Mountmorency escaped with great daūger, the whithe gaue warnynge vnto the other company and returned theym into Fraunce. Than the sayd Godfrey de Charney was layde vpon aborde, and so presented vnto kynge Edwarde the whiche had suche pyte of hym, that he cōmaunded his owne surgyons to loke vnto hym, and to cure hym in theyr best maner. And whā he was somdeale cured he was sente as a prysoner with other into Englande.
                     In this yere also the kynge caused to be coyned grotes &amp; halfe grotes, the whiche lacked of the weyght of his former coyne .ii. s. vi.d. in a .li. Troy.A great

And aboute the ende of August sessed the mortalyte or dethe in London / ye whiche was so vehemet and sharpe within ye sayd cytie, that ouer the bodyes buried in churches, and churcheyerdes, monasteries and other accumed buryeng places / was buryed that same yere in the charterhouse yerde of London .l.M. persones and aboue.
                     This yere also was ye yere of Iubile or clene remyssyon, whiche is kept at Rome at euery .l. wynter ende lyke as the yere of Iubile or grace is contynued at Cauntorbury.
                     And thys yere by the laboure of two cardynalles sent from pope Clemēt the .vi, was a peace cōcluded bytwene the two kynges of Englande &amp; of Fraūce for a yere, nere vnto the

owne of Caleys. wherefore the stablysshynge of the sayde peace for the sayde yere, assembled the two sayde cardynalles. And for the kynge of Englande, the bysshoppe of Norwyche than treasourer and chyefe chanceller of the kynge, with other vnto hym by the kynge assygned. And for the Frenche kynge, was there the bysshop of Laone, and the abbot of saynt Denys wyth other.
                     And the .xxiii. daye of the moneth of Auguste.

                     Than let vs now retourne vnto that noble prynce Edward, the fyrst begotten sonne of the kynge / whych by all thys tyme warred vppon the Frenchmen, as in ye precedynge yere is touchyd. So that lastly he retourned to Burdeaux wyth many ryche prysoners and pyllages, to the great honoure of hym selfe, and the greate auauncement of hys soudyours. And all be it that in that countrees, whyche he then passed, were the erles of Armenake, and of Foyze, of Poytyers, and of Cleremount, wyth syr Iames de Burbon̄, and many other

knyghtes, the whyche hadde dowble the people, as testyfyeth the Frenche cronycle, that the prynce had: yet passed he from Tholous to Nerbon̄, &amp; fro Nerbon̄ to Burdeaux wythout batayle.
                     And after the prynce hadde there a whyle rested hym and hys people, and sent dyuers of hys prysoners in to Englande / he wyth hys hoste entred the prouynce or coūtre of Berry in the moneth of Iuly, &amp; made therin sharpe and cruell warre. In whyche season also ye duke of Lancaster with the ayde of Phylyp brother vnto the kynge of Nauerne, was entred the countre of Constantyne / and so with a cōpany of .iiii. thousand men, came vnto a place called Lyseux vpon the see coste, &amp; remoued a syege of Frēch men, that had lyen at that castell vpō viii. wekes / and after repayred the sayde castell.
                     whan kynge Iohn̄ hadde leuyed many great summes of money, to ye great grudge of hys comons and rebellyon of some of the sayd comons, as in the story of kynge Iohn̄ shalbe towched, and preparyd hys hoste / he fyrst made towarde the duke of Lancaster. But the sayd duke had so fortyfyed ye passage, that he myghte not wynne to hym wythout great ieopardye and daunger. wherfore he lafte that waye, &amp; yode to a castell named Bretnell, and layde hys syege there vnto, and wan it in the ende of .viii. wekes by apoyntement. Then he yode to the castell of Chartres, and taryed there a certayn tyme for more people / and frō thens toke hys iourneye towarde prynce Edwarde. The whyche prynce in thys season was passed the ryuer of Loyre or Leyre, &amp; so by ye towne of Romūgtyne / where he was encountred of diuers nobles of Fraunce, and hadde wyth them a sharpe cōflycte. But in the ende god sent to hym the vyctorye / so that he slewe many of hys enemyes, &amp; toke of them many prysoners. Amonge ye whych were taken the lord of Craon̄, and a knyght called syr Bouciquāt, wyth dyuers other to the nomber, as sayth the Frēche boke of .liiii. persōs. And whan he had sent the sayde prysoners vnder saufe kepyng to Burdeaux, he sped hym toward Towris.
                     And the duke of Lancaster wyth hys company, after he had repayred the foresayd castell of Lyseux, and bestowed suche ordenaūce as the Frēch men for haste lafte behynde them at the sayd syege: he than toke his way towarde Bertneyll / &amp; from thens vnto Euroux, in brēnyng &amp; wasting the countre and townes as he went / and from thens to Uermeyll in Perch, &amp; toke by strength both the towne and castell. And whan he had spoyled &amp; pylled the towne, he set it on fyre and brent a great part therof. And whan he had done moch of his wyll in that coūtre, he retourned into Brytayne and helde hym there.
                     Kynge Iohn̄ then as aboue is sayde, holdynge hys waye towarde prynce Edward / came to the cytye of Towrys to fortyfye the sayde towne agayne the sayde prynce Edwarde. wherof herynge the prynce toke hys waye toward Poytyers. In holding of whyche way, as testyfyeth ye Frēch boke, a parte of hys hoste mette with an hoste of Frenchmen, &amp; gaue vnto them batayle, &amp; at length chasyd the multytude of them, &amp; slewe an hundreth sowdyours, &amp; toke vpō .lx. prysoners. Amonge the whych were taken the erle of Saūcer, ye erle of Iurrygny, the lord Chastelleyn mayster of the kynges palayes, &amp; a knyghte named syr Guyllyam de Daneham / the whyche prysoners were also sent vnto Burdeaux. And soone after prynce Edwarde lodged hym &amp; hys

hoste nere vnto Poytyers. And shortely after that came the French kyng and lodged hym in a place called in Frenche Chamgny, nere also vnto Poytyers / so that the frōtes of bothe hoostes laye wythin a quarter of a myle. Than the cardynall of Pernygourt sent from pope Innocent the vi. rode bytwene the kynge and the prynce sondry tymes to haue agreed some treaty and peace bytwen them, yf it myght by hys laboure haue ben opteyned. But whan he sawe hys laboure myght not preuayle / he departed to Poytiers, and taryed there the ende of the batayle. The whych was foughten vpon a mondaye the .xix. daye of Septēber, in the yere of our lorde .xiii.C.lvi, and begynnyng of the .vi. yere of the sayd kynge Iohn̄s reygne, as after shalbe shewed.
                     THan as before is sayde, for so mych as the foresayde cardynall myght not purchase any treaty or meane of peace bytwene these two prynces / prouysyō was made vpon bothe sydes to trye theyr mater by mortall batayle / so yt about the houre of two at after noone of the foresayd mōdayne, ye duke of Athenes or Athēs with such other nobles as were with hym in ye French kynges vaweward set vppon the Englysshe hoste.The batayl of Poytiers. The whyche was myghtely fensyd wyth wood and trees, in suche wyse that ye French speres myght not wyn vnto them. And therwyth the shotte of the Englyshemen was so fyers &amp; sharp, that it turned ouer horse and man. And whyle ye sayde duke of Athenes, wyth syr Iohn̄ de Cleremount than marshall of Fraūce wyth other, thus assayled the prynce &amp; his people vpō one parte / the duke of Normandye kyng Iohn̄s eldest sonne, &amp; the duke of Orleaūce the kynges brother, assayled hym vpon a nother part. The which two dukes were leders of two strōge hostes. But as sayth ye Frēche cronycle, these thre batayls dyd lytle scathe vnto the Englysshemen. But by reason of theyr shotte they were so woūded and many slayne, yt the resydue fledde to the great dyscomfort of the French kynges people. Than kynge Iohn̄ in all that he myght cō
                        forted hys people / and wyth a fresshe company set vpon the Englyshmen, that all wayes kept them hole togyder, and recyued the Frenchemen vpon theyr wepens poyntes, with so greate force yt in the ende the French men gaue backe, and were vaynquisshed by the helpe of god and saynte George / and slayne as wytnessyth ye sayde Frenche cronycle to the nomber of .xvii. hūdreth men of armys, besyde other meane sowdyours. Amōg the whych of noble men were slayne, the duke of Burbone, the duke of Athenes, syr Iohn̄ de Cleremoūt marshal of Fraūce, syr Reynold Camyan baneret, whyche that daye bare the oryflambe, a specyall relyke that the Frenche kynges vse to bere before them in all batayls, and the bysshop of Chalons, wyth dyuers other to ye nomber of .liiii. banerettes, besyde knyghtes &amp; other. And of prysoners taken at ye batayle, was Iohn̄ kynge of Fraunce, Phylyp hys .iiii. sonne, syr Iaques de Burbon erle of Poytyau and brother vnto the duke of Burbon before slayne, syr Iohn̄ of Artoys erle of Ewe, syr Charlys hys brother erle of Longeuyle, syr Guyffarde cosyn germayn vnto the Frēch kynge, syr Iohn̄ de Meleoun erle of Cancaruyle, syr Iohn̄ his sonne and heyre, doctour wyllyam archbysshop of Sens, syr Symon Melon brother vnto the erle of Cancaruyle and erle of Uandature, the erles of Dāpmartyne, of Uendosme, of Salysbruche, of Moyson, the Marshall of Denehā, &amp; many other, as banerettꝭ,

knyghtes, and men of name, to the nombre as sayth the Frenche cronycle of .xvi. hundreth &amp; aboue. And frō thys batayll escaped by flyght, Charles eldest sonne of kynge Iohn̄ and duke of Normādye, the duke of Orleaunce, &amp; the duke of Aniowe, wyth fewe other of great fame / the whyche yode streyghte vnto Parys. where shortly after was called a greate coū
                        sayll, for maters whyche in the story of kynge Iohanne shall after be shewed.
                     whan the feelde was thus fynysshed / prynce Edward after dewe thā
                        kes and louynges gyuen to god and saynt George for thys tryūphaūt vyctory / he with his sayd prysoners sped hym toward Burdeaux where ye sayd kyng was kept tyll Easter after.

                     IN thys .xxxiiii. yere, or more veryly in the moneth of Nouembre, &amp; ende of the .xxxiii. yere of kynge Edwardes reygne / he wyth prynce Edward and the duke of Lancastre, wyth a puyssant army landed at Caleys / and from thens passed by lande vnto Artoys, &amp; by Uermendoys to ye cytye of Reynes, and layde hys siege about that cytye / and beclypped it in suche wyse, that no man might entre or go out of the cytye without lycēce of the Englysshemen.
                     whan kynge Edwarde had lyen xl. dayes at the siege of reynes, without great dere or hurt vnto it doyng / he remoued hys syege &amp; passed by the countre of Champayne, tyll he came to a towne called Guyllone / where ye kynge rested hym a season. In which tyme came vnto hym certayne mē of the duchye of Burgoyne, as lordes of dyuers holdes and townes within that duchery / &amp; gaue vnto hym, to ye entent he shuld nat molest or hurte ye countre, ii.C.M. floryns of golde / whyche is to the value of sterlynge money of .xxxv.M.li. And ouer that the sayd Burgonyons couenaunted wyth hym, that they wolde mynystre to hym and his hoste, all such vytayles as was in ye countre plentuously for hys money. And that done he departed frome thens, &amp; yode vnto Neuers / and passed there the ryuer of Dyon or Ion̄, and yode to Colāges vpon Ion̄. And from thens in the moneth of Marche and begynnynge of hys .xxxiiii. yere of his reygn, he yode by the countre of Gastenoys toward the cytye of Parys. And prynce Edwarde with hys company passed by Moret, tyll he came to an hold which Englysshmē than kept called Tournelles

or Cournelles / before ye which towne or holde lay at that season certayne Frenchmen in a stronge bastyle, &amp; assayled the Englyshmen dayly / and remoued nat thens, all be it they were monysshed of the prynces commynge. They trusted so moche in the strength of theyr bastyle, whyche thē disceyued / for wythin .v. dayes of the princes commyng, theyr bastyle was goten, and many of them slayne, and to the nombre of .xlvii. persones of ye company taken prysoners. Amonge the whyche were .iiii. men of name / ye is to saye, the lorde of Bouyle or Bonile, the lorde of Daygreuyle or of Aygreuyle, syr Iohn̄ de Barres, and syr wyllyam de Plassyes.
                     Thus kynge Edwarde wyth hys people spedyng hys iourney toward Parys / vppon the tuysdaye beynge the laste daye of Marche in the weke before Easter, came vnto a place called the hostell of Chastelon, betwene Moūtlehery and Chastes / &amp; lodged hym wyth a certayne of hys people there. And ye prince with other lordes of hys hoste were lodged in the townes thereabout, from thens vnto the towne of Corueyll, &amp; an other towne called longe Iumell.
                     Thanne Charles eldest sonne of kynge Iohn̄, and that day regent of Fraunce / made meanes of treaty. whyche was laboured by a freer called Symonde de Langres, prouyncyal of the freers Iacobynes, &amp; legat of the pope. By whose meanes a day of treaty was appoynted to be holdē vppon good fryday, in the maledery of le longe Iumel. where at the same daye and place, apered for kynge Edwardes partye, the duke of Lācastre, the erles of warwyke &amp; of Northāpton, wyth syr Iohan de Chande, syr waltyer de Manuy, and syr wyllyam Cheyny knyghtes. And for the regēt apered there, the lorde of Fewe than constable of Fraunce, the lorde Bocy quant than marshall of Fraunce, the lord of Sarancyers, the lord of Uyg nay of the coūtre of Uyenne, syr Symond Bucy, &amp; syr Guychard of Auglye knyghtes / whyche treaty came to none effecte.
                     wherfore kynge Edwarde vpon the tuysdaye folowynge Easter daye remoued frome the sayd hostell, and lodged hym nere vnto Parys at a place named Chastellone nere vnto Mountrouge. And the residue of his hoste was lodged at Uauuys, at Uaugerart, at Gētylly, and other townes there about. Thā vpō frydaye folowynge, beynge the .x. daye of Apryl / by meanes of ye abbot of Clugny, which newly was sent from the pope Innocēt the .vi, the forsayd lordes &amp; knyghtes agayne assembled at a place called the Bālyē, to treate of an accorde betwene the kynge &amp; the regent. But theyr labour was spent in vayne, as it before had ben.
                     Uppon the sondaye nexte folowynge, a parte of ye kynges hoste came before the towne of Parys, and enbataylled theym in a felde faste by saint Marcelles / and taryed there frome the mornynge tyll thre of the clocke at after noone, to abyde batayle of the Frenchemen. The whyche made none yssue oute of cytye / natwithstandynge that as testifyeth the Frenche boke, within Parys at that daye were greate plentye of Sowdyours, ouer and besyde the greate foyson of the enhabytauntes of the same.
                     whanne the Englysshemen perceyued that they shulde haue no batayll of the Parysyens / they aboute thre at after noone departed the feld, and toke theyr waye towarde Chartres and so vnto Bōneuale nere vnto Chaceadon. Than kynge Edwarde was lodged at a place calle Dones.

To the whych place came vnto hym out of Parys the byshoppe of Beauuayes than chauncellour of Normā
                        dye with other / and so behaued them vnto the kynge, that a new daye of treaty was appoynted to be holden at Bretynguy, within a myle or lytell more of Chartres fore sayde, vppon the fyrste day of May next ensuyng.
                     AT whyche daye of apoyntemente / the foresayd duke of Lancaster, wyth the sayde erles of warwyke and Northampton, and other / at the sayde place apperyd for kynge Edwarde. And for the regent appered there the forenamed byshop, wyth many other lordes and knyghtes and spyrytuall men, to the nomber of .xxii. persons, whose names I ouer passe for lengthynge of tyme. The whyche so dylygently behaued hym, that in the space of .viii. dayes they agreed vpon an vnyte &amp; peace, the whyche was comprysed in .xli. artycles, as at length is rehersed in the Frenche cronycle, wherof the effecte is thys.

At whych season as sayth the cronicle of

                     In thys season that prynce Edwarde was thus in Spayne / Henry Bastarde fledde wyth hys wyfe into Fraunce, &amp; abode in a place or coūtre called Carcasson. But so soone as he was warned that prynce Edwarde was retourned vnto Burdeaux / he gadered to hym a new cōpany, &amp; passed by the moūtaynes of the forestes / &amp; so entred the sayd lande of Castile, the .xxvii. daye of the moneth of Septembre folowynge / &amp; had the citie called Calahore yolded vnto hym. whervnto hym drewe moche people of the countre / so that hys strengthe encreased hougely.

For they were so many that they were nombred at lx.M. But of theyr capytaynes is none named. Howe be it there were Englyshmen, Gascoynes, Pycardes Frenchemen, men of Nauerne, and of many other nacyons, whych the cronycle reherseth nat / &amp; contynued in theyr force and strengthe longe after, to the greate dammage of the countrees whyche they passed thorough / as Normandy, Gascoygne, Guyan, Burgoyne, and all the chyef countrees of Fraunce / and lyued by rauen and pyllage, to the great enpoueryssynge of the sayde countrees and townes, which they passed by or lodged in.

But in conclusyō all came to none effecte. So that breche of the peace whych before, betwene ye ii. kynges was so substācially concluded was brokē / &amp; eyther kyng for his partye made prouysiō for the warre. In so moch ye kynge Charles spedde hym to Roan in Normandy / &amp; there in ye moneth of Iuly rigged his nauy to set theym forewarde for to warre vpon Englande.
                     In whyche tyme &amp; season ye kyng Charles was thus occupyed in Normādy / the duke of Lācastre lāded at Caleys with a strōge company of archers &amp; other warryours / &amp; frō thens passed to Thorouēne, &amp; so to Ayre, in wastyng the countre with irne &amp; fyre as he went. wherfore ye French kyng in defence of those partyes, sente the duke of Burgoyne with a puyssaunt armye to withstāde the sayde duke of Lācastre.

And the English hoste was lodged betwene Gygowne &amp; Arde / so that ye frountes of both hostes were within a myle. Betwene whome were dayly skyrmysshes and small bykerynges without any notarye batayll. And whā the sayd duke of Burgoyn̄ had thus kept the sayde mount, frō the .xxiiii. day of Auguste vnto the .xii. day of Septēbre / he remoued hys hoste &amp; yode vnto Hesdē. For the whych dede he was after blamed of kyng Charles hys brother. After whych departure of the Frēchemen / the duke of Lancastre with hys hoste tooke ye waye towarde Caus or Caux, &amp; passed the ryuer of Sūme / &amp; so rode toward Harflew, entendynge as sayth the Frēche boke to haue fyred the Frenche kynges nauy.

                     And in the begynnyng of the moneth of Septembre folowyng, a Gascoygne borne, a man of good fame, whome the kyng of England had admytted for hys lyeutenaunt &amp; gouernoure of the countre of Poyteaw, named le Captall de Bueffe / faughte wyth an armye of Frenchmen before a towne named Sonbyse / where in conclusyon hys men were slayne and chased, &amp; he wyth .lxx. of hys partie taken prysoners. Than the dukes of Berry &amp; of Burgoyne vppon the .vi. daye of Septembre, came before Rochell / and had certayne communicaciōs with ye rulers of the sayd towne, for the delyuery therof. In this passe tyme &amp; season, kyng Edward heryng of the takyng of the erle of Pēbroke, &amp; of the losse that he dayly had of hys men in dyuers partyes of Fraunce, with also the ieopardye that ye towne of Rochell and other stode in / made hasty prouysyon, &amp; entendyd to haue passed the see. But the wynde was cō
                        traryous, that he myght haue no passage / wherfore he retourned as sayth Policronicō, agayne into the land.
                     Than vpon the .viii. daye of Septembre beforesayd, the captayne of Rochell, hauynge no cōforte of short rescous / yelded vppon certayne appoyntementes the sayde towne vnto the forenamed dukes, vnto the Frēch kynges vse.

                     And in thys yere after the duke of Brytayne had receyued many exortacyons &amp; requestes frome the Frenche kyng, to haue hym vpon hys partye: he sente for certayne sowdyours of Englishmen, &amp; strengthed with them some of thys castelles &amp; holdes. wherof heryng kyng Charles / sent thyder wyth a stronge power the forenamed syr Barthran de Claycon / warnyng theym to make warre vpon them as an enemye vnto the house of Fraūce.

At whych terme ende they set fyre vpon the towne, &amp; toke theyr way towarde Laemoys, and burned &amp; spoyled the countre as they wēt. And in processe of tyme passed the ryuers of Osne, Marne, and of Aube, &amp; rode thorugh Chāpayne / &amp; by the erledome of Brame streyghte vnto Guy / &amp; passed the ryuer of Seyn, &amp; so towarde ye ryuer of Leyr, and vnto Marcynguy ye nō

Excepte at a place or towne called Orchye, a knyght of Fraūce called syr Iohn̄ de

So that the Frenche boke sayth, for so moche as for lacke of meate for theyr horses and other paynfull thynges that in that iourney to theym happened, that though that iournay were vnto the Englysshemen honorable to ryde so ferre in the kynges lāde vnfoughten wyth / yet it was to theym very paynfull, cōsyderyng the manyfolde chaunces fallynge to theym, as losse of horses and other thynges duryng that passage.

And for to haue the better expedicion in hys matter / he brought vnto the kynge, the erle of Alenson, the duke of Brytayne, with dyuers nobles, the whyche made request for hym to the kyng yt he might haue iustyce. And with the countesse came the duke of Burgoyne, Lowys erle of Flaundres, and dyuers other noble men, makynge lyke request for her and for her ryght. Than syr Robert shewed forth a wrytynge sealed wyth the seale of armys of the erle of Artoys, conteynynge that whan the maryage was solēpnysed of syr Phylyp de Artoys father to the sayd Robert, &amp; of dame Blaunche doughter vnto the duke of Brytayne and mother vnto the sayd Robert, it was accorded that the sayd syr Phylyp hys father, gaue vnto ye sayd dame Blaū

And amōg certayne iewelles of that place to be had / he demaūded the greate crucyfyx of golde standynge ouer ye hyghe aulter of that monastery. wherunto the monkes answered yt they mighte nat departe with that crucifyxe / for Eugenius the thyrde of that name pope, accursed al them that layd any hande vpon that crucifyxe, to the entent to remoue it from that place, as it appereth by wrytynge set vnder ye fote of the sayd crosse / by whyche answere the kyng was pacifyed. And in the moneth of Decēbre, syr Godfrey de Harecourte wyth a towell double folden about hys necke, came vnto ye presence of kyng Philip, and yelded hym holy to hys mercy and grace / the whyche graunted vnto hym hys pardon.
                        And in shorte whyle after, all the Lumbardes vsurers wythin ye realm of Fraunce, were taken and sente to dyuers prysons.

And after the sayd Lumbardes vsurers were delyuered from pryson, by payenge of greate and greuous fynaunce.
                        In the .xix. yere of thys Philippe, for so moche as wytnesseth the Frēch cronycle, that ye Flemynges by great manacis and perforce, had constrayned theyr erle to be assured by bonde of assuraunce vnto the doughter of kyng Edward, contrary hys volūte and wyll / the sayde erle nat wyllyng to accomplysshe that maryage, in the Easter weke by a cautele deꝑted out of Flaūdres, and came to ye Frenche kyng to Parys / of whome he was honourably and ioyously receyued.
                        
                           And in the same yere, one named Gawyn de Belemount an aduocate of the spirituall lawe, entendynge to betray ye cytye of Laon̄ / acqueynted hym with a poore mā than dwellyng in that citie of Meaus named Colyn Tomelyn / ye whych before tyme was fled the cytye of Laon, &amp; was thā for lacke of substaūce comyn to Meaus, &amp; there mayntened a poore lyfe / to ye whyche thys Gawyn resorted &amp; releued. And lastely whāne he thoughte he was somdele of hym assured, he brake vnto hym hys mynde / &amp; sayd if he wolde be ruled by hym, he wolde restore hym to hys former prosperite &amp; welth / wherūto thys Colyner graū

Thā anone thys Gawyn shewed hym a lettre, &amp; wylled hym to bere it vnto ye kyng of Englād, with certayn rewarde to hym gyuyng / &amp; also promysyng of moch more, with that yt he retourned to hym shortly to ye citie of Raynes with āswere of ye same. whā thys poore and indygēt man had receiued this lettre / he cast many ꝑelles in hys mynde. How be it fynally cō
                           trary his othe and promyse, he toke hys waye towarde the French kyng, and presented hym with ye letter / in ye whych was expressed all the maner &amp; ordre how the sayd citie of Laō shuld be betrayed. whan the kyng was aduertysed of all the circumstaunce of thys treason / he enfourmed this Colyner how he shuld behaue hym selfe in beryng of hys answere / and prouyded hys tyme accordynge as though he had ben in Englād, &amp; by conueniēt day came vnto hym to Raynys accordyng to the former appoyntmente. In whych season the kynge had sent in secrete maner vnto the prouoste of Raynes, that so soone as the sayd Colyner had shewed to the sayd Gawyn his answere, yt the sayd Gawyn shuld be attached and had vnto pryson / the whyche was accordyngly executed. And in short processe folowynge, for so moch as he was within ordres / he was by the prouost sent vnto ye cytye of Laon, and there put to the bisshoppes pryson. But whan ye comōs of ye sayd cytye harde of suche a mā there beyng prysoner, that wolde haue betrayed theyr cytie / they assembled thē in great multitude, &amp; wold haue broken the prysō to ye ende to haue slayn hym. But they were so paciently answered by the bysshoppes offycers, yt they retourned vnto theyr houses. Upon the morow folowyng, to cease ye rumour of ye peple / he was brought vnto his iugement, &amp; there condempned for his dymeryte vnto perpetual pryson. And more therunto was added, yt for his more diffamy &amp; shame, he shulde be sette in a tumbrel vpon hygh bareheded, that of all people he myght be seen / &amp; so with moste shamefull instrumentes lad throughe the hygh stretes of ye cytye, and brought agayn vnto ye bisshopes pryson, and there to remayne for terme of lyfe. But he was nat fer in such maner cō
                           ueyed by ye offycers frō ye Gaole, but the cōmons fyl vpon hym with crye, &amp; castyng of myre &amp; stones / that or he were halfe way lad of hys circuyte or progresse, he was stoned to deth / and after his body buryed within a maroys nere vnto the sayd cytye.
                        And shortely after at Parys was done to cruell deth a cytezyn of ye sayd citie, which entēded to haue betrayed the sayd cytye of Parys. For ye which treason he was fyrst dismēbred of legges &amp; armes, and after hāged by the nek vpon the gybet of Parys.
                        In the same yere aboute ye feest of saynt Iohn̄ Baptyst / ye Englyshmen yt had holdē the towne &amp; castell called the roch of Aryan in Brytayn, by the terme of two yeres passed, at this season they were besieged &amp; fiersly assauted by syr Charles de Bloys and his

                           bre where the wyfe of the capytayne of the castell lay in her chyld bed, &amp; so ferre put in fere, that the rulers of the towne and castell graūted to delyuer the towne &amp; castell to ye sayd syr Charles, wyth that they myghte departe with theyr lyues &amp; goodes / ye whyche offer to hys payne &amp; charge he refused. For in short tyme after, syr Thomas of Agorn̄ an englysshe knyghte wyth a strōge company of archers &amp; other sowdyours, rescowed the sayd towne &amp; castell. And after lōge fyght and great daūger, as by lōge proces is declared in the Frēche story / ye sayd syr Thomas toke the sayde Charles de Bloys prysoner, and slewe many of hys lordes, as before is shortely touched in the ende of the .xxii. yere of kyng Edwarde. After whych victory thus opteyned, &amp; hys prysoners put in suer kepynge, he toke ye ordenaūce of the duke left in ye felde wyth other pyllage, &amp; put it wythin the towne &amp; castell aforesayd. And for ye vyllages and mē of the coūtre there about, had ayde the duke agayne the towne and castel / therfore the sayd syr Thomas punysshed the sayd vyllages and ruralles by greuous fynes, &amp; helde thē in great seruytude and daunger / and ouer ye slewe many of theym, &amp; many they helde as drudges &amp; captyues. And thys done the Englysshmen repayred agayne the walles and suche other places as were before tyme beten downe by force of the sayd syege &amp; strengthed it in theyr best maner.
                        IT was nat longe after ye kyng Phylype at the requeste of the coūtre, sent thyder the lord of Caron̄ wyth a stronge army / to whome also great multytude of the people of that countre resorted. wyth whose aydes the sayd lorde assayled the sayd town &amp; castell by .ii. dayes contynuell. But the Englysshemē deffended them selfe vygurously / and threw vpō theyr enemyes hote boylynge oyles and other gresys, with fyre coles &amp; hote asshes, wherwith they greued theyr enemies paynfully.
                        Thus cōtynuyng the siege / meanes of treaty were offered and cōdyssended to yelde the towne, with condicyō that they mynght saufely depart with theyr lyues and goodes / but the Frēchemen and Brytons wolde nat to it be agreable. Than the assaute began of new. And the lord of Caron̄ to encourage hys sowdyours, henge a purse and therein .l. scutes of golde vpon a sperys ende / and cryed wyth lowde voyce, that who that fyrste entred the towne, shulde haue the sayde l. scutes of golde. whan the ianuays or sowdyours of the cytye of Ieane and of the cytye of Italye, harde the promyse of theyr cheuytayne / a certayne of theym with longe pycaxses and sharpe approched theym vnto ye wallys / and so demeaned them, that in lesse than .v. houres they mynded so the wall, that there fyll thereof as testyfyeth the sayde Frenche cronycle the lengthe of .l. fote. By reason wherof entred fyrste the Ianuays / &amp; after the hole hoste. The whych with out compassyon or pyte slewe man, woman, &amp; chylde that came in theyr waye, nat sparynge the chylder that souked vpon the mothers brestes / &amp; spoyled and robbed the towne, euery man gettynge what he myght to his owne aduauntage. And whanne the Frēchmē and Brytons had thus miserably slayne many Englysshmē, &amp; also Brytōs &amp; other inhabytaūtes of the towne / they than assayled the castel to ye which was fled vpō .ii.C. &amp; .xl

Englyshmē. After dyuers assautes it was offered by the sowdyours of the castell, yt they wolde yelde the castell theyr lyues and goodes saued. And finally it was agreed, theyr bodies onely to departe, &amp; to be cōueyed .x. miles vpon theyr waye towarde such place as they wolde appoynt. vpō ye which appoyntement .ii. knyghtes Brytons yt is to saye syr Syluester de la Fulle and syr wyllm̄ de Stratton receyued them in theyr cotes, and cōueyed thē with great payne &amp; nat without losse of some. For theyr enemies of ye hoste caste stones at theym, and bete them so with theyr staues, that dyuers of theym dyed / &amp; the remenaunt were broughte nere vnto a castell than in the power of Englysshemen, named Quyntyne.
                        But whan the commōs of ye town there nere, harde of the cōmynge of suche Englysshmen vnder saufe conduyt, the whiche before in the batayl of the roche of Arian where syr Charles de Bloys was taken, had slayne theyr lord, that is to meane the lorde of Quyntyne / anone they issued oute of the towne / and for they fonde lytel resystence in theyr guydes, they slew theym there excepte one, whych was capytayne of the Englyshmē / whych one of ye sayd knyghtes caused to be set vpon hys horse, &amp; so fledde frō the peryll. And whā the cruell Brytons had thus shamefully slayne the Englyshmen / they gadered ye cariens vp on an hepe, &amp; suffered theym there so to lye, to ye ende that beastes &amp; foules myght deuoure them. And in shorte tyme after, ye erle of Flaūdres by meanes of the Frēch kyng left the doughter of kynge Edwarde, and was maryed vnto the doughter of ye duke of Brabant.
                        In the .xx. yere of Phylyp / ye town of Calays was goten, lyke as the circumstaūce thereof is declared in the xxii. yere of kyng Edward the thyrd. And in the same yere the mortalite or sykenes, whych after reygned in Englande reygned nowe feruentely in Fraunce, and moste specially in the cytye of Auynyon / by force wherof ye thyrde parte of the people of ye cytye dyed. And frome thens it came vnto saint Denys, and so vnto Parys. In which coost it was so feruent, yt there dyed in those .ii. townes ouer the nō

After whych treaty thus concluded / the kynge of Nauerne vnder assuraunce of hostage came vnto kyng Iohn̄s presence at Parys. And after he had taried there a season / he departed with dyssymulacion on eyther partye vsed, as after shall appere.

                        Than the sayde thre astates helde theyr coūsayll at the fryer mynours or gray fryers in Parys, by the space of .xv. dayes. In whyche season they appoynted amonge theym to the nō

The whyche .l. persones whā they had appoynted .vi. of them selfe to go vnto the duke / they in ye names of ye other made request vnto ye duke, that he wolde kepe secrete such thynges as they entended to shewe vnto hym. which request he graūted. Thā they shewed vnto the duke that the realme before tyme hadde ben mysseguyded by offycers / and excepte that remedye for it were shortlye foūden, it shulde stāde in greate parell to be loste. wherfore they besought hym to dyscharge all suche as they wolde name vnto hym, &amp; ouer yt to forfayte theyr goodes vnto the kynges vse.

Upon the whyche requestes, the duke gaue answere yt he wolde gladly fele the opynyon of hys coūceyll, &amp; vpon that shape vnto them some reasonable answere. But fyrste he desyred of them to knowe what ayde the iii. astates wolde gyue vnto hym, for the delyuery of hys father. wherunto it was answered, that the clergy had graūted a dyme &amp; a halfe to be payed in a yere, wyth that that they maye haue licence of the pope / and ye lordes asmoche to be leuyed of theyr lādes / and ye comōs the .x. peny of theyr mouable gooddes. Thā vpō the morne folowynge within ye palays of Louure, ye duke assembled hys coūsayl / &amp; there shewed vnto them the desyre &amp; requeste of the .iii. astates. wherupon were made many reasons / and many messages sent betwene the duke and them, to refourme some parte of the sayde artycles. But it was fermely answered by theym, that excepte he wolde reforme the sayde defautes, &amp; cōferme hym vnto theyr myndes for the comō welth of all the lande / they wolde nat ayde hym with theyr gooddes, lyke as they had to hym shewed. wherfore the duke by secrete meanes sent letters vnto his father, shewyng vnto hym the circumstaūce of all hys matter / the whyche wrote vnto hym agayne, that in no wyse he shulde be agreable vnto the sayde requestes. Thā the duke to ye ende that he wolde nat y• these maters shuld be towched in the open parlyamēt, sent for suche persones as were the chyefe rulers of the sayde .iii. astates / so that to hym came for the clergy the archebysshoppes of Raynes and of Lyōs, and the bisshop of Laō / &amp; for the lordes came syr warayne de Lucēbourgh, syr Iohan de Comflās Marshall of Champeyne, and syr Iohn̄ de Pygueny thā ruler or gouernoure of Artoys / &amp; for the comōs Stephan Martell than prouost of the marchaūtes of Parys, Charles Cusake, with other of other good townes.
                        Than the duke shewed vnto them of certayne newes that he had lately receyued from the kynge hys father / and that done he asked theyr aduices whether it were beste ye daye to shewe theyr requestes openly in the parliament chaumber, or elles to deferre it for that daye. And lastlye after many reasons made, it was agreed, that it shulde be deferred tyll the .iiii. daye after / at the whyche .iiii. daye ye duke wyth the other assembled in the parlyament chambre. At whyche season the duke sayd that he myght nat entende that day to here and argue the sayd requestes, for certayn tydynges that he had lately receyued from his father, and from his vncle the Emperour of Almayne / of the which he thā shewed some opēly, and after dyssolued for that daye the counsayll.
                        In the moneth of Octobre, ye .iii. astates of the prouynce of Languedocke, by the auctoryte of the erle of Armenake thā lieutenaūt for ye kyng assembled for to make an ayde for ye kynges delyueraūce. And fyrste they agreed to puruey at theyr propre costes .v.C. mē of armys, wyth a seruyture to eueryche spere / and ouer that a .M. sowdyours on horsebacke, and a .M. of arblasters, wyth .ii.M. of other called paūsyers in Frenche / all whiche to be waged for an hole yere. The speres to haue for them &amp; theyr custrun euery daye halfe a floreyn, &amp; euery sowdyour and arblaster .viii. floryns for a moneth, and ye paūsiers after the same rate.
                        
                           Also it was forther ordeyned by the sayd thre estates of Lāguedocke, that no man shulde were any furrys of any greate pryce / and that women shulde leue the ryche atyre of theyr heddys, and were neyther perle nor golde vppon them, nor syluer vppon ther gyrdels, so longe as the kynge remayned prysoner. Also that all maner of mynstrellys for ye season shuld be put to sylence / wyth dyuers other thynges for y• weale of that prouince whyche wolde aske a longe leysoure to wryte.
                        UPon all sowlyn daye or the seconde daye of Nouember, the duke of Normandye by the aduyce of hys counceyll, dyssoluyd the coūceyll of the thre estates assembled at Parys / and commaunded euery man to retourne vnto his own, without effecte growynge of theyr longe counceyll or assemble. wherwith many of the sayd persons were greuously myscontent / sayeng amonge them selfe that they aperceyued well, that thys was done by the duke, to the entent that the requestes by them deuysed shuld not take place / but that the olde mysgouernaunce shulde contynue, lyke as it befortymes had done. wherfore dyuers of them assembled after agayne at the graye freres, and there made out dyuers copyes of the sayde requestes / to the ende that eyther of them myghte bere them into theyr countreys, and there to shewe them vnto the good townes. And all be it that the duke after this coūceyll thus dyssoluyd, asked ayde of ye cyty of Parys and other good townes to maynteyne his warrys / he was playnely answered that they myghte not ayde hym without the sayd thre estates were agayne reassembled, &amp; that the graunte of the ayde myght passe by theyr authorite / wherunto ye duke in no wyse wolde be agreable.
                        In the moneth of Nouēber aforesayde / syr Robert de Cleremoūt than lyeutenaunt for the duke in Normā
                           dy, fought wyth syr Phylyp brother vnto the kynge of Nauerne, and syr Godfrey de Harcourt, the which then toke party agayne the Frenche kyng for the deth of his neuewe before put to deth by kynge Iohn̄. The whych knyghtes wyth other helde the more parte of the countre of Constantyne within Normandye, maugre the dukes power. In this sayde fyghte the vyctory tourned vnto the Frenche partye / so that the sayde syr Phylyp was chasyd, and syr Godfrey de Harcourt slayne, with .viii. hūdreth men of that party. And the fourth daye of December folowyng, was the castell de la Pount nere vnto Roan, which by a longe season had ben in the rule of the forenamed syr Phylyp, gyuen vp by appoyntement / the whyche by the dukes sowdyours had ben besyeged from the moneth of Iuly to that daye / so that than the holders of the sayd Castell departed wyth all theyr goodes, and .vi. thousande frankes for a reward for the yeldyng vp of ye sayd castell. A franke is in value after sterlyng money .ii.s. or therupon.
                        Upon ye .x. day of December were proclaymed at Parys certayne coynes and values of money newly ordeyned by the duke, and his coūceyl. wyth the whyche proclamacyon the comons of the cytye were greuously amouyd. And for reformacyon the prouoste of the marchauntes wyth other, yode vpon the seconde day folowynge vnto the castell or palays of Louure, there to treat with syr Lewys erle of Angeou brother vnto the duke and his lyeutenaunt whyle the sayde duke was gone vnto the cytye of Meaus, there to speke wyth Charlys of Bohemye or of Beaume then

emperour of Almayne &amp; vncle vnto the sayde duke▪ where the sayde prouoste wyth the other made requeste vnto the erle, that he wolde cease the vse of that money. And yf not / they wolde so demeane them that it shuld not be suffered to be put forth nor taken within ye cytye. wherupon it was answered by the erle, that he wolde take aduyce of hys counceyll, &amp; vpon the morowe gyue to thē an answere. Upon the daye folowynge / the sayde prouost wyth a greate company of ye cytye retourned. At whyche season the erle in curteyse maner, desyred them to retourne that other daye, for as moche as yet he had not suffycyentely commonyd with his coūceyll. Upon the morne the sayd prouost retourned wyth a moche greater company. where after longe debatynge of the mater, it was agreed by ye sayd erle and prouost and hys company, that the money shuld be stopped and not to be put fourth, tyll they hadde further knowlege of the dukes pleasure / for knowlege wherof the erle sent forth messēgers ī all spedy wyse.
                        And in thys passetyme, Peter de la Forest archebysshop of Roan and chaunceller of Fraunce was made &amp; publyshed a cardynal. And the .xxiiii. daye of the moneth of Ianuary, the duke retourned vnto Parys wyth ye sayd cardynall in hys company / the whych for reuerēce of the cardynall, was fette into the cytye wyth processyon and other ceremonyes, as well of the clergy as of the cytesyns. The xxvi. daye of the moneth of Ianuary the prouoste of the marchauntes of Parys with other of the cyty, apered before the dukes counceyll at saynte Germayns. where it was desyred of the sayd prouoste, that he shulde suffer the forsayde money to ronne and be curraunt thorough the cytye. The whyche the sayde prouoste wyth hys company vtterly denyed / and after many greate and bolde wordes, departed from the sayde counceyll in greate ire / and after theyr retourne vnto the cytye, encensyd so the comynalty, that they set a parte all werkmanshyp and occupacyō in shyttyng in theyr shoppes, and drewe vnto theym theyr armour and harnesse. whan the duke was enfourmed of thys murmour of the comynaltye of the cytye, he sent vnto the prouoste / commaundyng hym strayghtly that the kynges peace were kepte wythin the cytye / and ouer that, that he with a certeyne of the cytesyns shulde apere before hym in the palayes of Louure vppon the morowe folowynge at an houre assygned. At which houre the sayde prouoste wyth hys company came vnto Louure, and so were conueyed into the parlyament chaumber, where the duke wyth hys counceyll was than present. Than ye duke after certayne chalengys made vnto the prouoste for hys obstynacy in thys mater, and mysledyng of the comynaltye of the cytye / sayde vnto hym, that all be it that the kynge by hys prerogatyue myght at hys pleasure and for his auaūtage, make his moneys whan he wolde, &amp; so to suffer them to be curraūt thorough his realme: yet for the weale and ease of hys subiectes, consyderynge theyr manyfolde and late charges / he was cōtent that at thys season thys newe money shulde be spared / and that the iii. estates shuld be agayn assembled / &amp; that they shulde depryue all suche persons than beryng offices, as they shulde thynke preiudycyall to the realme / &amp; ouer that to ordeyne suche money as myghte be benefycyall for ye land. Of all whiche graūtes, ye prouost, to ye entent that he myght of authoryte shewe them vnto the comynaltye of the cytye desyred wrytyng.

The whyche the duke to appease the people, though it were some deale cō
                           trary hys mynde and pleasure, graū
                           ted vnto hys request. For the whych graunt, dyuers of the sayd offycers, as the chaunceller or cardynall and other absentyd them selfe, and came not in Parys by a tracte of tyme after. The .xxx. daye of Ianuary ensuynge / the duke at the requeste of the sayde prouost, sent certeyne offycers vnto the house of syr Symonde de Bucy, and of syr Nycholas Brake, and of Enguerran of the Celer, and of Iohn̄ Prylle, whyche before wyth other were accusyd of mysgouernaunce of the realme / whose houses were by the sayd offycers kepte, and inuentuaryes made of suche goodes as than remayned wythin the sayde houses. And that done, the duke sent out commyssyons, that the thre estates shulde reassemble at Parys the xv. daye of February next folowyng / whyche was obserued and kepte. whan ye sayd .iii. estates were agayne assembled in the parliament chaumber at Parys, in the presence of the duke and hys brethern wyth dyuers other nobles of Fraūce / mayster Robert Coke bysshop of Laon, by the cō
                           maundement of the sayd duke, made a longe preposycyon of the mysguydynge of the kynge and the lande by the meane of yll offycers / as well by chaungynge of the moneys as other many vnlefull excysys and taskys, to the greate inpouerysshynge of the comynaltye of the reame, greate dysclaunder to the kynge, and to the synguler enrychynge and auauncement of the sayd offycers. wherfore the .iii. estates prayen, and specyally the poore comons, that all such offycers may be remoued from theyr offyces / and other that shall be thought more benefycyall for the kynge and hys realme, to be admitted. Of the which the cardynall was noted for pryncypall / and other to ye noumbre of .xxi. wherof some were ryghte nere vnto the duke.
                        AFter whyche preposicyon or oracyō thus by the sayd bysshop ended / syr Iohn̄ de Pygqueny in the name of the .iii. astates, offered that the sayde .iii. astates shuld gyue vnto the kyng .xxx.M. mē for an hole yere / wyth y• that all thynges myght after that daye be ordered as the bysshop had before deuysed. All whyche artycles were vnto them by the duke graūted. And inconueniētly all such offycers as they before had named, were clerely auoyded / and other such as by ye sayd .iii. astates were though moste necessary, were put and chosen to theyr roumes / excepte that some of the olde, as maisters of thaccomptes and some of the presydentes &amp; maysters of the requestes, were holden in for a tyme, to practes &amp; shewe vnto ye new how they shuld ordre and guyde the sayd offyces.
                        And the .xxvi. daye of the moneth of Marche was a newe money proclaymed thorough Parys, suche as the sayde .iii. astates had newly deuysed. Upon the .vi. day of Apryll was proclaymed in Parys, that ye people shulde nat paye suche subsydes as ye iii. astates had ordeyned for the wagynge of .xxx.M. men aforesayde or for the kynges fynaūce / and also that the sayde .iii. astates after that daye shulde no more assemble for any causes or maters before touched, tyll they had farther knowlege of ye kynges pleasure. For the whych proclamacion the cytezyns of Parys were greuously amoued agayne the bysshop of Sēs, the erle of Ewe cousyn Germayne to the kynge, and agayn the erle Cācaruyle. By whose meanes they sayde thys proclamacyon

was purchasyd. And treuth it is that the sayd archbysshop of Sens wyth the sayd .ii. erlys, were sent from the kynge from Burdeaux yet there beynge, to the entent that they shuld se the sayde proclamacyon put in vre. But so soone as the sayd proclamacyon was made / they herynge of the murmour of the people of the cytye, sped them thens shortely after. Then vpon this ye comons waxed so wyld, that they lefte theyr occupacyons &amp; drewe them to cōuentyculys and cō
                           panyes, and hadde many vnsyttyng wordes by the kynge and hys counsayle. wherof in auoydynge of inconuenyency / the duke commaunded a watche to be kepte wythin the cytye bothe by daye and by nyght / and certayne gates of the cytye kept shytte, and the remenaunt watchyd wyth men of armes. Upon the eyght daye of Apryll then beynge Easter euyn, a nother proclamacyon was made all contrary to that other / by vertue wherof it was charged, that the foresayde subsydie shulde be leuyed, and that also the thre estates shulde reassemble at Parys the .xv. daye after Easter / and there to procede vpon all such maters as before were by them begonne. Upon the .vi. day of Apryll the Frenche kynge shypped at Burdeaux and so was conueyed into Englande, lyke as before is shewed in ye xxxi. yere of kynge Edwarde. And aboute mydsomer folowyng, ye duke of Lancaster, whyche by a longe season had lyen before a towne in Brytayne named Rosne, brake vp hys syege / takyng of them of that towne for a fynaūce .lx.M. scutys of golde. A scute is worth .xi.d. sterling. About the feste of Mary Magdalene in the moneth of Iuly, controuersy and varyaunce began to aryse amonge the parsōs assygned for the thre estates. wherof the cause was, for so mych as the sessyng which they had auewed &amp; sessed for the .xxx.M. men, wolde nat extēde vnto the sūme by large &amp; great sūmes. So yt the clergy answered yt they wolde paye no more than they were fyrst sessed vnto. And in lyke maner answered such as were apoynted for the lordes &amp; for the good townes. wherfore ye archebysshop of Raynes, whych before was one of the chefe rulers of them, refused theyr partye and drewe hym all to the duke. By meanes of whyche controuersy many of theyr actes fayled / &amp; suche as before were put out of theyr offyces, were agayne restored. About the myddel of August, the duke sent for the prouost &amp; Charles Cusake, wyth Iohn̄ de la Ile / the which bare ye pryncipal rule within the cytye, and also were great sayers &amp; doers in the assembles of the iii. astates, &amp; had takē vpon thē moch rule in ye busynes / so that moche of ye busynes was ruled by them &amp; theyr meanes. To whome the duke gaue strayght commaūdemente, that they shuld cease of theyr auctorities, &amp; nat to deale any more with the rule of the realme, but onely to the good rule &amp; gouernaūce of the cytye of Parys. And that done the duke rode aboute vnto dyuers good townes, &amp; made request vnto them for ayde / and also to haue the money to be curraūt amōg them, whych as before is shewed the x. daye of Decembre was at Parys proclaymed. But he sped lytle of hys purpose.
                        In thys meane whyle, the cytezyns of Parys of one wyl &amp; mynde, offered before saynt Remyge a taper of waxe of wonderfull lengthe and greatenesse / the whyche they ordeyned to brenne day and nyght whyle it wold laste. And shortely after they sent vnto the duke so plesaunt message, yt he retourned agayne vnto the cytye / whome they receyued with all honor

and reuerence. And vpon the morow after hys retourne / the prouost wyth certayne other of the cytye, shewed vnto the duke that they wolde make a greate shyfte for hym towarde the mayntenaunce of hys warres. And to brynge that mater to good conclusyon / they besought hym yt he wolde assemble at Parys shortly, a certayn persones of .xx. or .xxx. good townes there nexte adioynaunt. The whych was vnto thē graunted / so yt shortely after there assembled at Parys, vpō lxx. persones / the whyche helde theyr counsayll to gyther by sundry days. Howe be it in the ende they shewed vnto the duke, that nothynge they myght brynge to effecte, without assemble of the .iii. astates / &amp; besoughte hym that they myght be efte reassembled / trustyng that by theyr presence the dukes mynde shulde be contente and satysfyed.
                        Upon whyche requeste the duke sent hys cōmyssiōs, chargyng ye sayd iii. astates to apere before hym at Parys, the wednysday nexte folowynge ye day of al sayntes. And full fayne he was to do all thyng that the citezyns of Parys hym requyred to do / for as testyfyeth the Frenche Cronycle, he was so bare of money that he hadde nat suffycyente to defende hys cotydyan charge.
                        IN the .viii. yere of kynge Iohn̄ and wednysday after Alhalowen day / the .iii. astates reassembled at Parys, and helde theyr counsayll within the blacke freers. Durynge whych coūsayll the kyng of Nauern̄ that longe had ben holden in pryson wythin the castell of Alleux, was deliuered by the meanes of syr Iohanne Pyquygny, than gouernoure of the countrey of Arthoys / and after conueyed by the sayd Iohn̄ vnto ye town of Amyas. whan ye kyng of Nauerne was thus set at large / anon his syster and other of hys frendes made meanes vnto the duke of Normandy, for an vnyte &amp; a peace to be had betwene them / and by them a meane was foū
                           den, that the kyng with such as were in hys company, shulde come vnder saufe conduyt to Parys to common with the duke. whā dyuers of the .iii. astates, as such as were of Chāpeyn and Burgoyn, knewe of the comyng of the kyng of Nauerne vnto Parys / they without leue takyng departed. And vpon the euyn of saynt Andrew the sayd kynge entred Parys wyth a greate companye of men of armes. Amonge the wyche was the bysshop of Parys, with many other of ye sayd cytye. Upon the morowe folowynge the daye of saynt Andrew / the kynge entēdynge to shewe hys mynde vnto the comynalte of the cytye, caused an hyghe scaffolde to be made by ye wall of saynt Germayn where he was lodged. where moche people beynge assembled, he shewed vnto them a lōge processe of hys wrongefull enprysonemente, and of the mysgydynge of the lande by meanes of ille offycers, wyth many couerte wordes to ye dyshonoure of the Frenche kynge, and iustyfycacion of hym selfe and excusynge of hys owne dedes, and so retourned into hys lodgyng.
                        Uppon the thyrde daye of December / the prouoste wyth other of the cytye yode vnto the duke / and in the names of the good townes or commynaltyes of the same, requyred of hym that he wolde do vnto the kynge of Nauerne reason and iustyce.
                        To whome it was answered by ye bysshop of Laon, that the duke shuld nat allonly shewe vnto the kyng reason &amp; iustyce / but he shuld also shewe vnto hym frendely brotherhode,

with all grace &amp; curtesy. And all be it that at that season, many of ye dukes coūsayll were present, to whome the gyuyng of that answere had more cō
                           ueniently apperteyned thā to ye sayde bisshop / yet they were at that tyme in suche fere, that they durste nat moue any thynge that shuld soūde cōtrary the displeasure of the kynge of Nauerne or of the prouoste &amp; other. Thā it was agreed that vpon ye saterdaye folowynge, the kynge and the duke whyche as yet had nat spoken togyther, shuld mete at the place of the syster of the sayd kyng. where they met with vnfrendely coūtenaūce / &amp; after they had communed there a lōge season, departed with litle loue or charite. And vpon the mūday folowyng, were shewed vnto the duke &amp; hys coū
                           sayle, certayne requestes desyred by the kyng of Nauerne / the whych the duke was forsed to graunt. whereof the substaunce was, that the kynge shuld haue agayn and enioye al such lādes, castelles, and townes, with all mouables to them belōgynge, as he was in possessyō of ye daye that kyng Iohn̄ was taken within the castel of Roan / and ouer that he shuld be pardoned of all offences by hym done agayne the crowne of Fraunce before that daye, and all other hys adherentes, or suche as had taken hys partie before yt tyme. And soone vpon thys, was ordeyned that the erle of Harcourt and other, whyche kyng Iohn̄ had caused to be beheded and after to be hāged vppon the commō gybet of Roan, shuld be delyuered vnto theyr frendes, to be buryed at theyr pleasures. After whych conclusions taken, and assuraunces made as farre as the dukes auctoryte wolde extende vnto / syr Almary knyghte, Menlene knyghte, wyth thre or foure men of honoure mo, were sente into Normandye, to repossesse the kyng of Nauerne in all such lādes, castelles, and townes, as he before tyme was in possessiō of, wyth all mouables vnto the sayd landes apperteynynge. And than the sayde kynge and duke helde famylyer company, and dyned and souped togyther often sythes, at the manoir or lodgyng of quene Iohan syster vnto the sayd kynge, and other places.
                        Also the sayde kynge delyuered out of prysone, all prysoners as well spyrytuall as tēporall, suche as were thought any thyng fauourable vnto hys cause. Amonge the whyche some there were, that for theyr demerites were adiuged to perpetuall prysone.
                        In thys tyme &amp; season tydynges sprange within the cytye of Parys, that the kynges of Englande and of Fraunce were agreed, and that kyng Iohan shulde shortely returne into Fraunce. By reason of whyche tydynges, the kyng of Nauerne made the more haste to dyspache hym oute of Parys / so yt he with hys company departed from Parys the .xx. daye of Decēber, &amp; rode toward the cytye of Maunte in Normādy. Soone after the kyng was thus departed / dyuers enemyes to the noumbre of .x. or .xii.C. came within .iiii. or .v. myles of Parys / whyche were demyd to be of the company of syr Phylip brother vnto the kyng of Nauerne. These robbed and pylled the countrey thereabout / in so moch that the people of the coū
                           trey of Preaux and Trappes, and other there aboute, were constrayned with theyr mouables to flee vnto Parys. wherfore the duke sente out hys letters and cōmyssyons, for to assemble hys knyghtes to withstande the sayd enemyes.
                        But the sayde cytesyns of Parys caste an other way / and thought it to be done to the greuaunce or

correccion of them. For dowte wherof / the prouost with other that had ye gouernaunce of the cytye, caused the gates to be kepte / and none shuld entre but suche as lyked them.
                        In thys passe tyme the kynge of Nauerne beyng in Normādy, requyred delyuere of the castelles of Bretnell, of Euroux, and other / the which to hym by ye capytaynes were denied. wherfore he thynkyng that the duke performed nat to hym hys promesse / gathered vnto hym greate strengthe to wynne by strength that he myght nat haue hys former bāde &amp; promes. Of thys was put in greate wyte the bysshop of Laon, whych was ye chefe counceloure of the duke, &amp; especyall frende vnto the kynge / so that what thyng was spoken in the dukes coū
                           sayll, was shortly after manifested by hym and hys meanes vnto the kyng of Nauerne. Thys also was one of ye chefe rulers of the assemble of the .iii. astates / and after lefte them and fell by hys greate doublenesse and dyssymylacyon in the dukes fauoure, and so became chefe of hys counsayll, for the whyche of the comon people he was named ye beste with .ii. mouthes. Than the cytezyns of Parys heryng of the denayeng of the sayd castelles vnto the kynge / knewe wel that mortall warre shuld growe betwene hym and ye duke. And for they wolde haue the cytezyns knowē from other straū
                           gers / therefore they ordeyned theym hodys parted of rede and blewe / chargynge euery man that he shulde nat passe hys lodgynge wythout ye hood and conysaunce.
                        Upon the .viii. daye of Ianuary the kyng of Nauerne entred the cytie of Roan with a great company of mē of armes / and drew vnto hym many englysshe men; and suche as were enemyes vnto the Frenche kynge. And vppon the .xii. daye of Ianuary the sayde kyng assembled the people of that cytye, and made a lyke sermō vnto thē as before he had done vnto the comynaltye of Parys / and dyd a solempne obsequy to be done for the erle of Harcourt and the other wyth hym put to deth, as aboue is sayd by kynge Iohn̄. in thys whyle the duke of Normandy that longe whyle had taryed in Parys, in hope and ayde of the cytezyns / &amp; was euer by the prouoste and other dryuen of from daye to daye: It was aduysed hym by his counsayll, that he shulde shewe hys mynde vnto the comynaltye of the cytye.
                        wherof whan the bysshop of Laon and ye prouost were ware / anone they shewed vnto hym many doutes and impedymentes and also parelles, for to treate with a comynaltye. Nat withstandynge he refused theyr counsayll, &amp; caused the people to be assembled at theyr common hall. whyther he wyth a small company came, the xi. daye of Ianuary aboute .ix. of the clocke in the mornyng / where he shewed vnto the commons a longe and a plesaunt oracyon. wherof the effect was, yt he bare very faythfull mynde vnto the cytye / and for the weale therof he wolde put hys lyfe in ieopardy. And where as by hys euyll wyllers he was reported, that he shulde gather men of armes to greue the citie / he sayd and swore it was neuer hys entencion, but onely to auoyde suche enemyes as dayly pylled and robbed theyr neyghbours and frendes. And where he also knewe well, that great summes of money were gathered of the people towarde the kynges fynaunce / he lete theym vnderstande yt no peny thereof was comyn to hys handes.
                        But hys mynde was, that suche persones as hadde receyued that money, shulde wyth theyr assystence be

called to a due accompte. whych oracyon wyth many kynde and louynge wordes ended / ye people with it were very well contented / so that of theym he was wel commēded and allowed. Upon the morowe beyng fryday and xii. day of Ianuary / the prouost and other of hys affynyte, herynge of the fauoure that many of the commons bare vnto the duke, and ferynge leste the duke shuld by hys meanes turne the comons vpon them / assembled a great parte of the cytye at a place called sait Iames hospytall, &amp; specyally suche as they knewe well fauoured theyr partye. whan ye duke was ware of the assemble, anone he spedde hym thyther, hauynge wyth hym the bysshop of Laon. where by the mouth of hys chaūceler, he caused to be shewed a parte of the matter whyche he hym selfe had shewed the day before vnto the comynaltye / with more, yt where as such as ought vnto hym no good wylle, reported hym that he kept nat promyse made with the kyng of Nauerne / he shewed there the contrary. And yf any thynge were nat to hym parfourmed, it was contrary to hys mynde &amp; pleasure / &amp; that that in hys power lay nat to fulfyl. And so soone as ye chaūceler had ended hys tale / Charles Cusake stode vp to the entent to haue shewed hys mynde. But there was such a rumoure and noyse amonge the people, that he myghte nat be harde / so that thanne the duke parted with suche companye as he brought, excepte the bysshop of Laō, whych taryed there with the prouost and other. And whan the duke was departed Charles Cusake began his tale, &amp; spake boldely agayne the kynges offycers / and by couerte wordes somwhat agayne the duke. After whyche tale fynysshed one named Iohn̄ de saynte Ounde, whyche by auctoryte of ye thre astates was newlye made one of the generall gouernours of the subsydy / stoode vp and sayde, that the prouoste nor no other persone of the thre astates, hadde no peny of that subsydie in theyr hādes / the whiche sayenge the prouoste also affermed.
                        Forthermore shewed than there ye sayde Iohn̄, that certayne knyghtes whyche he there named sent from the duke, had receyued of the sayde subsydye to the summe of .l. or .lx.M. mo tons of golde, the whyche were enployed to no good vse. After whyche processe ended by the sayde Iohan / Charles Cusake agayne beganne to speke, and made a longe comendaciō of the prouydence and good dysposycion of the prouost, whyche had takē vpon hym great payne and displeasure, &amp; spent largely of hys owne for ye comō welth of the cytye. wherefore yf he myghte knowe that the comynaltye wolde nat ayde and stande by hym for the furtheraūce of the same / he wolde be content to leue of, &amp; gete hym there as he shulde be quyte of al trouble, and also out of the daunger of all hys enemyes. whereunto was anon made a greate exclamacyon by the people, sayenge they wolde lyue and dye wyth hym in that quarell.
                        UPō the .xiii. day of Ianuary / the duke sent for dyuers persones of the thre astates, &amp; exorted theym by goodlye and amyable wordes, that they wolde demeane theym agayne hys father and hym, as faythefull and louynge subiectes / and he shulde so reporte theym vnto the kynge, that they of hym shulde haue greate thankes.
                        And as touchynge hym selfe / he wolde be so good lords vnto theym, that they shulde thynke theyr kyndenes and fydelyte well bestowed.

bestowed. The whyche graunted vnto hym theyr trothe and seruyce to ye vttermoste of theyr powers / aduysynge hym to take vpon hym the gouernaunce of the realme / for they thought he taryed to long or he toke the rule therof. Than soone vppon thys, the sayd thre estates ordeyned a more feble money than they before had made, to the aduauntage of the duke / to the ende that he sholde wythstand the enemyes forenamed, which as yet remayned in the coūtre about Parys, and pylled the vyllages and toke prysoners / the whych they conueyed vnto suche holdes as they thā helde in that countre. Thus duryng these manyfolde aduersytees amōge the Frenchmen / vpon the .xxiiii. daye of ye sayd moneth of Ianuary, Iohn̄ Baylet treasourer vnto ye duke, was slayne at Parys of a yoman or Uarlet of the chaunge called Peryne Marke. The whyche Peryne after that cursyd dede done, fledde vnto saynt Mary chyrche. But at nyghte the duke sent syr Iohn̄ de Shalous hys marchall, wyth the prouost of ye cytye named Guillyam Scayse and other / the whyche brake vp the chyrche dores and toke the sayde Peryne out by force / and ladde hym vnto prison called the Chastelet. Out of the whych vpon the morne he was takē, and hys handes smytten of / and so drawen vnto the gybet of Parys, &amp; there hanged. But vpon the thyrde daye folowyng, by meanes of the bysshop of Parys he was taken downe and buryed wythin the sayd chyrche of our lady, wyth greate reuerence and solempnyte. At whyche obsequy was present the prouoste of the marchauntes, with many other burgesis of the cytye. The fyrste daye of the moneth of February / syr Iohn̄ de Pyquyny came vnto Parys from ye kyng of Nauerne, and made request vnto the duke, of dyuers couenaūtes by hym to be perfourmed towarde ye kynge, whyche as yet were nat accō
                           plysshed. whyche requeste the duke toke vnpacyētly / and gaue vnto the sayd syr Iohn̄ many hygh and displesaūt wordes. Howe be it in the ende ye bisshop of Laon sayde, that the duke shuld be aduysed vpō ye answere of ye kynges demaūde. Upon ye .iii. daye of February, ye prouost of the marchaū
                           tes, wyth certayn of ye vnyuersyte of Parys &amp; other burgeyses, yode vnto the duke vnto Louure. where it was requyred by the sayde persones, that he wolde fulfyll vnto the kyng of Nauerne, all suche couenaūtes as were lately made with hym / and specially that the castelles of Euroux &amp; other before named, myghte be delyuered vnto hym accordyng to his apoyntemēt. And farthermore it was shewed vnto the duke by a doctoure of diuynyte, that yf he or the kynge of Nauerne wolde swarue from any poynt or artycle of the sayde former agremente / that the .iii. astates had vtterlye determyned to ayde and assyste hym, that wolde kepe the sayd agrement, &amp; to wythstāde the other that wolde nat obey or vpholde the sayde concorde &amp; agrement. whereunto the duke was wel agreable / sayeng that he had perfourmed all his promesse, excepte the delyuere of certayne castelles, whyche the capytaynes wythhelde contrary hys mynde and pleasure / layenge for theyr excuses, that by the kynge hys father to theym they were delyuered, and to hym and none other they wyll delyuer thē agayne.
                        Upon the .xi. day of February, certayne of the .iii. astates beyng at coū
                           sayll in theyr place accustomed / ye prouoste of ye marchaūtes assēbled theyr craftes of ye citie at a place called sait Clowe or Cloy in harnesse.
                        
                           In whych tyme of hys with them there beyng / an aduocat of the parliamēt called mayster Reynolde Dacy, as he was goyng from the dukes palays toward his owne house, he was slayne by men of the towne.
                        And soone thereafter the sayd prouost with a great company of armed men entred the palays of Louure / &amp; so with a certayne complyces entred the dukes chaūbre, &amp; there withoute salutyng of the duke sayd vnto hym: Syr dysmay you nothyng whatsomeuer ye se vs do, for we entende to your persone no harme. And or these wordes were fully ended / his cōpany fell vpon a knyght called syr Nycholas de Cōflans thā marshall of Chā
                           payne, and vpō syr Robert de Cleremoūt leuyng vpon the dukes bedde, &amp; slewe them out of hande. whan the duke behelde thys horryble dede, he was in meruelous fere of hys owne persone / &amp; prayed the prouoste wyth hys cappe in hys hāde, that he wolde saufegarde hys persone / the whych y• prouost graunted, with that he wold by hym be aduertysed.
                        Than the sayd .ii. dede corses were drawen downe the steyers withoute pytye / and layed in the court that all men myghte beholde that myserable spectacle. And for the dukes saufegarde, the prouost toke vnto hys partye a hood of redde &amp; blewe, ye whiche he put vpon his hed / and the prouost receyued the dukes hood beynge of burnet &amp; garnysshed with a frenge of golde / &amp; so eyther ware others hode all that daye. And that done, the prouoste with hys company wente vnto theyr comon hall / where he shewed vnto the comynalty that the .ii. persones were especiall enemyes vnto the comon weale, and false traytours to god &amp; to the crowne of Fraunce / and that he and hys adherentes entēded the preseruacion of the commō weale of the realme, and the cytye / &amp; wolde vnderstāde of theym, whether they wolde stande by hym in that doynge or nat. The whyche cryed wyth one voyce ouy, ouy / that is to saye ye, ye. And whan he had receyued this comforte of ye people, he retourned agayn vnto the duke. Than he recomforted hym and sayd, that al that was done, was done by thassent of the people, &amp; for to auoyd ye greater inconueniēce. For these that were slayn were great enemyes vnto the common welthe, &amp; traytours vnto the crowne. wherfore he wylled ye duke to alowe that dede / &amp; yf any pardō were requysyte for ye dede or any other to be hadde, that he shulde lyberally graunt it. All which thynges the duke was fayne to saye ye vnto / and prayed hym &amp; the other than also of the cytezyns to be his frē
                           des, &amp; he wold in lykewyse be theyrs. And after thys agremēt / the prouost sent for .ii. clothes one of redde / and ye other of blewe / and wylled the duke to make hoodes of the same for al his seruaūtes. And so the duke and hys seruaūtes were clothed in the lyuery of the towne / the blewe set vpon the ryght syde. Than agayne night whā the sayd .ii. corpsys had lyen all daye vpon the stones of the palays / ye prouost commaūded them to be layed in a cart, and so without preest or other reuerence to be cōueyed vnto a place of sait Katheryne there to be buryed. And whanne the sayde corpsys were thus brought vnto the sayde place, yt carter toke one of theyr garmentes for hys laboure, &amp; so departed.
                        It was nat longe after that a messanger came from the bysshop of Parys, whyche warned the bretherne of that house to spare the buryenge of syr Robert de Cleremoūt, for asmoch as the bysshope noted hym, accursed for brekyng vp of sait Mary church, whan he by force fette oute Peryne

Marke, as before is shewed. But after, they and also ye aduocate mayster Reynolde Dacy were buryed secretelye. Uppon the morne folowynge the prouost assembled at the frere Augustynes a great company of the cytye, wyth all suche as then were there of the good townes by reason of ye foresayde coūsayll. To whych assemble, by the mouth of mayster Roberte de Corby a mā of the cytye, was shewed a protestaciō of all the cyrcumstaūce of the foresayd mater / and howe that by the dukes coūs
                              ••

                        Thys busynesse thus cōtynuyng, the kyng of Nauarne came vnto Parys the .xxvi. daye of February, wyth a good company of armed men / and was cōueyed by the cytezeyns vnto a place of the dukes called the Neell, &amp; there lodged. To whome the prouost with his cōplyces made request, that he wolde make allyaūce with theym, and to supporte theym in that ye they hadde done / the whyche by hym was graūted. Than the quene hys syster and other, made instante laboure to agree hym and the duke. whych in cō

And ouer that hys syster called quene Blāche, shuld haue ye lordshyp of Morette for her Dowry. After whyche accorde thus concluded / the kynge and the duke kepte together very frēdely and louyng familyarite, dyned and souped eyther with other by many and sundry tymes, &amp; eyther vnto other gaue ryche gyftes. Amōg the whyche one was, that the duke gaue vnto the kyng the sayd place of Neell whych he than lodged in.
                        Upon the .xii. daye of Marche, the duke of Normandye was proclamed regent of Fraunce thorough ye cytye of Parys / and after thorough all Fraunce. And soone after he departed from Parys, and rode into ye countre of Champayne, where he taryed a season. And the kynge of Nauerne retourned to Maunt in Normandye. Than the regent drewe vnto hym the nobles of Champayne &amp; of Prouynce / and began to manace the prouost and other of Parys, that before had put hym to dyshonoure, and slayne so vylaynously hys trewe counceyllours. And after promesse taken of the erle of Brene and other nobles of that countrey, yt they shuld ayde hym agayne hys fathers rebelles and hys enemyes / he than rode vnto the abbey of Ponley in Monstruell / and after yode vnto a castell whych belonged vnto quene Blanche syster vnto ye kynge of Nauerne, and wyllyd the Capytayne named Tanpyne to delyuer to hym that castell. The whyche after dyuers denayes, opened the gates and receyued in the regente, and lodged hym therin that nyght. Upon the whyche the regent caused the sayd Tanpyne to swere vnto hym, yt he shulde kepe that castell to his vse / and after made hym styll wardeyne of the same / and so departed thens &amp; rode to Meaux where hys wyfe laye.
                        In thys tyme and season the prouoste of the marchauntes of Parys, herynge of the regentes doynge▪ and of the affynyte that he made with thē of Champayne, fered the sequell therof. wherfore by the aduyse of such as fauoured hys cause / he yode into the castell of Louure, and there toke out

                           peygn. And where as before was appoynted, that the .iii. astates shulde ye fyrste daye of May assemble at Parys / the regent thā sent out hys commyssiōs, and charged ye sayd .iii. astates to assemble the thyrde daye of the sayd moneth of May at Compeyngne aforesayde / wherewith the sayde cytezyns of Parys were greatly amoued. At thys assemble was graunted vnto the regent, a subsydy bothe of ye Clergy and also of the laye fee / so yt the regent waxed dayly strōger and stronger. wherof heryng the kyng of Nauerne / remoued from a towne called Merlo / and with a stronge company came vnto a place or towne named Domage, purposely for to treate wyth the regent for the cytezeyns of Parys. where in the begynnynge of May yt sayd two prynces met, eyther hauynge greate strengthe of men of armys.

In whyche season he warned theym of the great dyspleasure that ye regēt bare towarde the cytye / and aduysed them to make theym as stronge as they myght. In thys passe tyme the bysshop of Laon beynge with the regent at Cōpeyne, was lyke to haue ben vylonyed by some of the regētes counsayll. wherefore in secrete wyse he departed vnto saynt Denyse / and from thēs he was fette by the kyngꝭ seruaūtes of Nauerne vnto Parys / in whome was put great faute of all thys trouble.

And ye regēt in thys whyle came to the cytye of Sens in Languedocke, where he was honorably receyued / all be it yt the comons of that cytye &amp; gentyles of that coūtrey, were greatly lenyng vnto the cytezyns of Parys / &amp; there taryed a season to expresse to thē hys mynde.

wyth one Iohn̄ Uayllaunt prouoste of ye kynges money, with a company of .viii.C. men in harnesse rode vnto the cytye of Meaux / wherof ye mayre of that cytie they were ioyfully receyued, contrary hys promesse before made vnto the regent. where with assystence of the sayde mayer &amp; other of that cytye, they entended to haue taken the wyfe of the sayd regent, with other noble women thā there soiournyng wyth hyr / and so to haue conueyd them vnto Parys, there to haue kepte them tyll the cytezyns myghte purchase the fauour &amp; grace of the regent.
                        But whā the erle of Foyse, whych thanne hadde the rule of the sayde gentylwomen, knewe theyr entente / anone he gathered vnto hym hys cō
                           pany / and wyth assystēce also of som of the sayd cytye, he made vppon .vi. or .vii.C. men in harnesse, and yssued boldly agayne the foresayde persons and skyrmysshed wyth theym. In which skyrmysshe in the ende, the mē of Parys were sconfited and chased, &amp; the mayre of Meaus named Iohn̄ Soulas taken with other / which after for theyr rebellyō were put in execucion. And after thys victory thus opteyned / &amp; in reuēgemēt of the deth of a knyghte called syr Lewys de Chambly there slayn with other gentylmen / &amp; for the vntrouth of ye cytie: the foresayd erle set fyre vpon a syde of the cytye, &amp; brēt a great parte therof, as well churches as other / which fyre was scātly stenched in .viii. days after.
                        In thys whyle the kynge of Nauerne herynge of the greate harme &amp; distrucciō that the company of Guyllyam Calley made of gentylmen in Moūtmerēcy &amp; other places, lyke as before is shewed, yode agayne hym / &amp; nere vnto a place called Cleremoūt encountred hym and his people, and gaue vnto theym batayll, and slewe moch of his people / and toke hym on lyue, &amp; caused hys hede to be stryken of. And soone after, the cytezyns of Parys sente vnto hym / requyrynge hym to drawe towarde thē. At whose requeste he sped hym thytherwarde, and entred the cytye vpō the .xv. daye of Iuny / and was cōueyed vnto sait Germayne in Pree &amp; there lodged. And vpō the morne he wēte vnto the comon halle of the citie / where the comōs beyng assembled, he made vnto them a lōge &amp; plesaunt oraciō, of the great kyndenesse that he had founde in many of ye good townes of Fraūce &amp; specially in the cytye of Parys. For the whych they had bounde hym to take theyr partye agayne all other, makyng none excepcyō. After which tale by hym ended / Charles Cusake stode vp, &amp; shewed vnto the people what ruynous poynt the lāde stode in for lacke of a wyse hedde &amp; gouernoure. wherfore he exhorted ye people to chose ye kyng for theyr gouernour. whyche than was so done / &amp; he there toke vpon hym the rule, &amp; promysed with them to lyue and dye. Upon the xxii. day of the sayd moneth of Iuny / ye kyng of Nauerne with a cōpany of vi.M. speres of the citye &amp; other, departed from Parys, and rode vnto a towne called Gonnesse, where an other company of the cytye taryed for hym / &amp; from thens rode towarde Sē
                           lys. But whā the gentylmen of hys hoste vnderstode that he had takē vppon hym to be capytayne of the cominaltye, where agayn the more partie of the nobles of Fraunce were of the contrary partye / they left hym many of them, &amp; specially suche as were of the duchye of Burgoyne / and wyth congy of hym taken, resorted into theyr coūtreys. whā the regent had vysyted dyuers countreys, &amp; wonne vnto hym the beniuolence of ye same,

&amp; had also gathered vnto hym greate strength / he spedde hym towarde Parys / &amp; lodged hym in the ende of the moneth of Iuny, in a place called in Frenche le Pount de Charenton fast by Boyes in Uyncent. In whose cō
                           pany were noumbred vpon .xxx.M. horsemen / so that the countre there about was pylled &amp; wasted with that hoste.
                        wherof herynge the kynge of Nauerne, retourned backe agayne, and came wyth hys hoste vnto saynt Denys wythin .ii. myles of Parys. And the cytye of Parys was kepte daye &amp; nyght, that no man myghte entre or go out, wythout lycēce of ye prouoste &amp; other rulers therof. In this meane whyle that the sayde two prynces lay thus with theyr two hostes about the cytye / quene Iohan syster vnto the kynge, made an instaūt labour vnto the regent for grace for the cytezyns. By whose meanes a comucaciō was appoynted to be holdē betwene the kynge &amp; the regente, the eyght day of Iuly, at a place called ye wynde mylle faste by the house of saynt Anthony. At whyche metynge it was lastly accorded betwene ye sayd prynces, that the kyng of Nauerne shulde do hys best to brynge the cytezyns of Parys vnto due obedyence. And yf he sawe in theym suche obstynacy, that they wolde nat do theyr dutye, &amp; to gyue for theyr rebellyon suche summes of money as by hym &amp; the regent shuld be thought accordynge / that than the kynge shuld vtterly refuse theyr partye, and turne vnto the regēt with all hys power.
                        And ouer that, the kyng for all demaundes that he coude aske of the regent for any cause, ouer the agremēt betwene them laste made, shuld haue iii.C.M. floryns of gold, wherof an C.M. to be payed that daye .xii. monethes, and yerely after .l.M. tyll the fulle were payed. And farther it was accorded, that the kynge after yt daye shulde take partye with the regente agayne all persones, excepte onely ye kynge of Fraunce / And to the ende yt thys accorde shulde be fermely holdē vppon bothe sydes / the bysshoppe of Lyseux there beynge presente, wyth many other lordes, sāge there masse within the tente where thys accorde was concluded / and after agnus dei, sware the two prynces vpon the sacrament, that withoute collusyon or fraude they shulde obserue and kepe eueryche artycle of the sayde accord. After whyche conclusyon thus takē / the regent repayred vnto hys hoste, &amp; the kynge vnto saynt Denys. Than vppon the morowe the kynge entred Parys, and conueyed thyther wyth hym but a certayne / &amp; so taryed there all that daye, wythoute any reporte sendy
                              •
                           ge vnto the regent.
                        And the seconde daye for ye more strēgthynge of the towne, he sent for certayne Englysshe sowdyours, as archers and other, and sette them in the towne wagys / &amp; nother sente nor retourned vnto the regente with any answere. Than towarde the nyght, how it was assaut was made by som of the regentes people vppō a parte of the town, so that dyuers men were slayne vpon bothe sydes / but the mo vppon the partye of the cytye.
                        Than the kynge of Nauerne vpō the morowe retourned vnto sait Denys / leuynge within the cytye ye foresayde strēgthe of Englyshmen wyth other. whan the regente was ware of the kynges beynge at saynt Denys / he sent vnto hym, and hym requyred of perfourmaūce of suche accorde as lately betwene theym was condissended / &amp; syns by hys meanes he myght nat enduce the cytezyns to due obedyence, that he wolde accordynge to hys promesse take partye with hym / 

wherby they and other enemyes to y• comon welth, myght be recoūceyled. whereunto the kynge answered and sayd, that the regēt had brokē ye sayd accorde. For where he by hys dylygēce &amp; laboure, had brought the cytezyns to a nere poynt of recōciliacyon &amp; submyssiō / the regent by the meane of that assaute whyche he made vnto the towne, caused the sayd cytezeyns to renoūce all theyr former graunt, &amp; to bynde them vpō theyr former wyl fulnesse. After whyche answere thus gyuen by the kyng / the regēt caused his people to passe ye ryuer of Sayne by a brydge made of botes, and so to brenne the towne of Uyttry &amp; diuers other townes, &amp; robbed &amp; pylled the coūtrey there about.
                        Upō the .xiiii. day of Iuly, dyuers of the towne of Parys issued oute of the towne / &amp; with the ayde of the Englyshmen endeuoured them to haue socoured the sayde towne of Uyttry / with also to haue destroyed ye brydg. At whych iournay they bare them so well, that with theyr shotte they woū
                           ded many of theyr enemies / and toke prysoner the regentes marshall named syr Reynolde de Fountaynes with dyuers other / &amp; after retourned vnto theyr cytye.
                        Upon the .xix. day of Iuly, ye quene Iohn̄ syster vnto ye kyng of Nauern̄, with the archebysshop of Lyons, the bysshop of Parys, with certayne other temporall persones of the cytye / yode vnto a place assygned withoute the towne. where with them met the regent &amp; certayne of hys coūsayll / &amp; at lengthe cōcluded an unyte and cō
                           corde betwene the sayd regent &amp; cytesyns, without farther payne or exacciō to be put vnto them / excepte that the sayd cytesyns shuld humbly submytte thē vnto the regent, in aknowlegyng theyr offēce, &amp; askyng of hym mercy &amp; grace for the same / &amp; ouer yt to be ordered forther as the kynge of Nauerne, the sayd quene Iohn̄, with the duke of Orleaūce &amp; the erle of El cāps, wolde deme &amp; adiuge / and that graunted, the regēt to opyn all ways &amp; passages as well by lāde as by water, that al marchaūtes may passe as they before tymes vsed / &amp; in lykewise they of the cytye to opyn the gates of the towne, and to receyue all straungers.
                        AFter whych agremente thus cōcluded &amp; agreed, with all other before made betwene the kyng &amp; the regent to be maynteyned &amp; vpholden / the regēt sent from hym moch of hys people / &amp; appoynted the sayd bisshoppes &amp; the other for the towne, to mete with hym ye .iiii. day folowynge at a place called Laiguy syr Marne. where he wolde haue also the kynge of Nauerne &amp; the other, to perfyghte and clerely fynysh the sayd agremēt / &amp; vpō thys made proclamacions thorough the hoste, that a good and perfyght peace was agreed. wherefore many of the hoste for dyuers causes theym mouynge yode towarde the cytye, trustyng there gladly &amp; louynglye to be receyued. But vpōn ye morne whan they came vnto the gates, they fande them watched with harnessed men, whyche wolde none suffre to entre but suche as them lyked / amōg the whyche one named Macequetta seruaunte of the regētes was mysse entreated. And nat withstādyng that accorde / yet the mouable goodes of suche as were with the regent &amp; had houses within the cytie, where disperbled and stroyed.
                        Upon the .xxi. day of Iuly &amp; euyn of mary Magdaleyne, a stryfe began to kyndell within the cytye / so that ye cytesyns complayned them vpon the Englysshemen, surmysynge agayne thē dyuers causes. By meane wherof

the comonte in a fury yode vnto the palaye of Necl, where at yt tyme many of the capytaynes of the Englysshemen dyned wyth the kynge of Nauerne / vpon whome they fell sodeynly, and slewe of them vpō .xxiiii. &amp; after in diuers places of ye citie, toke the other deale to the noūbre of .iiii.C. or thereupon, and closed theym in dyuers prysons. with whych doyng, the kynge of Nauerne, with also the prouoste and other the gouernoures of the cytye were right fore discontented. wherfore vpō the day folowyng, the kynge assembled the comynaltye at theyr comon halle / entendynge by plesaūt wordes to haue caused them to haue ben repētaunt of the murder of the foresayd capytaynes, &amp; also to haue gotten the remenaunte oute of pryson.
                        But the more the kynge spake for the Englysshemen, the more woder were they dysposed agayne theym / sayenge yt those whyche were within the cytye, shulde nat alonely be putte to deth; but also suche as were at sait Denys, whyche there spoyled that towne &amp; countrey enuyron / and had had suche wordes vnto the kynge, yt in the ende he wyth the prouost &amp; the other gouernoures, were fayne to graunte vnto them, that they wolde go with theym for to helpe to dystres the sayde Englysshemen. And so the same daye agayne nyght / the comōs yssued by the gate of saynt Honoure / &amp; the kynge of Nauerne with the prouost &amp; theyr company went out by ye wyndemylle, so that in the sayd assē
                           bles of the kynge &amp; the comons were noumbred vppon .xvi.C. speres, and of foote men vpon .viii.M. whan the kynge with hys company was comē into the feelde where the sayd wyndemylle stādeth / he houed there well vp on halfe an houre, to se what ye other company wolde do. The whych sent out .iii. speres to espye where the Englyshmen were, and espyed of theym vpō .xl. or .l. that apered by a woddes syde nere vnto saynt Clow / and wenynge that the sayde Englysshemen there had bē no mo, retourned &amp; shewed what they had sene. whereupon the sayde comons in all haste spedde theym thyther. And whā they were within the daunger of theyr shotte / ye Englysshmen issued oute of dyuerse parties of the wode, and woūded and slewe many of them. wherwith the other beynge fered fled incontinently / whome the Englysshemen pursued so cruelly, that they slewe of the fote men vpon .vi.C. in all.
                        whych season the kyng of Nauern̄ and also ye prouost with theyr peple, stode styl &amp; neuer moued towarde thē for theyr defence or ayde. After thys scomfyture thus susteyned by the Parysyens / the kyng lefte the cytye and rode vnto saynt Denys / and the prouoste wyth hys company returned vnto Parys. where he was receyued wyth hydyous noyse and crye, aswel of womē as mē, for yt he so cowardly had suffered hys neyghbours to be woūded and slayne. By reasō of this the murmure of the people encreased dayly more and more agayne the prouost / so that in maner a party was taken betwene the prouoste and the other gouernours of the cytye and the comynaltye. For the comons wolde haue put to deth many of the prysoners of the Englysshemen / but ye prouost with hys affynyte let them, and preserued them from theyr fury and malyce.
                        And vpon the .xxvii. daye of Iuly beynge frydaye / the sayd prouost beyng encōpanyed wyth .viii. score or ii.C. mē in harnesse, yode vnto Louure and other prysons and, toke out ye sayd Englysshemen, &amp; conueyed thē vnto the gate of saynt Honoure / and

so sent theym vnto theyr other felysshyp than beyng at saynt Denys.
                        Of whome they were ioyously receyued and welcomed / &amp; specyally of the kynge of Nauerne, at whose requeste as the comō fame went, yt prouost wyth the other rulers of ye town them delyuered. Thus more &amp; more cyuyle dyscorde began to encreace wythin the cytie / so that the rulers of ye cytye were now in as great dought and fere of theyr neyghbours, as before tyme they were of the regēt &amp; his knyghtes.
                        So that vpō the tuysdaye folowynge beynge the last daye of Iuly / ye prouost wyth other of hys company beyng in harnesse as dayly they were vsed, went to dyner vnto the bastyle of saynt Denys. And there beyng at dyner / the prouost cōmaūded to such as thā kept the keyes of that bastyle, that they shuld delyuer theym vnto Geffrey de Mastō than tresourer of the warres of the kyng of Nauerne. But the porters denayed ye commaū
                           demēt / &amp; sayde presysely yt they wolde nat delyuer the keyes to hym nor yet to any straūger. For the whyche answere many hawte wordes were blowen on eyther partye / so that people gadered about them. wherof heryng one named Iohn̄ Maylart, to whom belōged the watche of a quarter of ye cytye / wherein &amp; in whyche quarter the sayde bastyle stode, drewe nere &amp; gaue ere vnto the wordes / &amp; shortly after in bolde maner sayd vnto ye prouost, that the keyes shulde remayne styll with the sayd kepers, &amp; nat to be takē out of theyr possessiō. By meane of whych wordes the prouoste wyth hys company were encensed wyth more malyce / &amp; vttered many hyghe and dysdaynous wordes to fere the sayd Iohn̄ Maylart and the other. wherfore the sayde Iohn̄ Maylart feryng the prouost, lest he shuld shortly call hys strēgthe to hym, &amp; by meane thereof put hym and other to an afterdele / sodenlye gate hym on horsebacke / &amp; berynge a baner of ye French kynges in hys hande, cryed wyth alowde voyce, Mon ioye saynte Denys au Roy et a duke. whā the people sawe hym thus ryde aboute, and cryed ioye to the kynge &amp; the duke / anone moche people folowed hym, &amp; cryed in the same wyse. And in lykewyse dyd the prouost &amp; his company, whyche toke the waye towarde the bastyle of saynte Anthony. And the sayde Maylarte rode towarde the market place, &amp; there houed wyth his company. In whyche tyme &amp; season one called Pepyn de Essars, nat knowynge of the feat of Iohn̄ Maylart, in lyke maner gathym on horsbacke / and berynge a baner of the armes of Fraūce, rode about cryeng ye forsayd crye, &amp; so lastly came vnto the other. whyle the commōs were thus assembled in the market place / the prouost came vnto the forsayd bastyle of saīt Anthony / where it was reported to yt kepers of that bastyle, that the prouost hadde lately receyued letters frō the kynge of Nauerne whyche they desyred to se / wherof the prouoste denayed the syghte, &amp; specyally one named Guyffarde. wherefore after som wordes of dyspleasure, one strake at the sayd Guyffarde, &amp; throughe hys harnesse woūded hym. where with ye prouost beyng amoued, made resystē
                           ce agayn the sayd kepers / so yt eyther ranne at other wyth theyr wepyns. In whych stryfe the sayd Guyffarde was fyrst slayne / &amp; after the prouoste wyth one of hys cōperes named Symōde Palmeyr. wherof heryng ye fore sayd Iohn̄ Maylart &amp; hys cōpany, in all haste sped thē thyder &amp; pursued vpō other yt thā were fled for fere / &amp; so streightly serched, yt they fōde one called Iohn̄ of ye Ile, &amp; Giles Marcell

vnder the prouoste of marchauntes, whych they also slewe without pytie. And after at ye bastyle of saynt Martyne, they foūde one called Iohn̄ Paret the yōger, whome they slew also. And soone were they spoyled of all yt they had, and layd naked in the open strete for all men to loke vpon. And whan they .vi. corpsys had so lyen by a certayne tyme / they were than put in a carte &amp; drawen vnto a house of saynt Katheryne, and there buryed vnreuerently. And vpon the morowe folowyng, were taken Charles Cusake, &amp; Iosseron or Geffrey Maston, and put into the chastelet, and there kept in strayte pryson. And thus seased thys ryot wythin the cytye of Parys, that had contynued for the more partye by ye space of a yere &amp; .ix. monethes / as from the begynnynge of the moneth of Nouember in the .vii. yere of kyng Iohn̄, vnto thende of ye moneth of Iuly in the .viii. yere of thys sayd kyng / or from the takyng of the duke in hys chaūbre, to the deth of ye prouost by the space of .vi. monethes. After whyche persones thus slayen / the sayd Iohn̄ Maylart sent vnto ye regent, requyrynge hym yt he wolde spede hym vnto ye citie / &amp; in ye meane whyle to sende some noble man to haue the rule of the same. And in that whyle the comōs made serche, &amp; toke many of the former rulers, as Petyr Gylle grocer, which as before is said was capytayne vnto thē yt were sent vnto Meaus. And wyth hym was taken syr Pyers Caylart knyghte and wardeyne of the castell of Louure. Also one called Iohn̄ Prenost, wyth Petyr Blount. Also a vocate named mayster Peter Puyssour / &amp; a felowe of hys named mayster Iohan Godarde. All which ꝑsones were shortly after put to deth by sundry tymes, &amp; theyr bodyes cast in to a ryuer called Bone Uoycyne. And vppon the .xii. daye of August, the regent was receyued into Parys with all honour and gladnesse. whereof heryng the kynge of Nauerne, &amp; of the puttyng to deth of Ioss
                              •
                           ran hys tresourer / sente vnto the regēt wordes of defyaūce / letting hym to vnderstande that he wolde be reuenged of that wronge and other.
                        UPon the .xiiii. day of August, the regent caused to he assembled within the commō hall of Paris the cytezyns / to whom he made a lōg declaracion of the treasons &amp; ryottes done by these persones put to deth, &amp; by the bysshop of Laon &amp; other yet leuyng / whych entēded as he sayde to haue made ye kyng of Nauerne kyng of Fraūce, &amp; to haue yelden the cytye of Parys into the power of Englysshemen. Thā the kynge of Nauerne with the Englyshmen yode vnto Meloon / where they by fauour &amp; strēgth occupyed ye yle, &amp; all yt coūtrey whych stretched toward Byer / &amp; warred vppon the countrey toward Gastenoys &amp; dyd therin moche harme aswell by fyre as otherwyse. And shortly after syr Iohn̄ Pyquegny &amp; syr Robert his brother, whych were capytaynes vnder the kyng of Nauern̄, made warre vpō the towne of Turnay and other townes of Pycardy / and slewe many of the common people, and toke prysoners of the gentylmen of that countrey to the noumbre of an hundreth &amp; aboue.
                        Amonge the whyche the bysshope of Noyen was takē, and wyth the other ladde vnto a castell or towne called Creeyll, wherof the foresayde syr Robert was capytayne / and so contynued in doynge domage in dyuerse places, aswell nere vnto Parys as elles where. Durynge whyche warre thus made by the kynge of Nauerne and hys accessaries / in the moneth of

Septembre and begynnynge of the ix. yere of kynge Iohn̄, the foresayde syr Iohn̄ de Piquegny layd his siege vnto the cytye of Amyas, &amp; wā within the bulwerkes of the same / so that the cytye was lyke to haue ben yeldē vnto hym, ne had ben the rescous of the erle of saynt Poule, which draue the sayd Iohn̄ &amp; hys people a backe. But the sayd syr Iohn̄ wyth ayde of the Englysshemē quytte hym so mā
                           fully, that he had the domynyō of all that coūtrey of beawuasyne / so that wyne nor no marchaundyse myghte passe to Tournay nor other townes therabout, without hys saufe cōduyt or lycēce. And in lyke maner syr Robert knolles capytayne of the Englisshemen in Brytayne, gatte there many holdes &amp; townes, whyche I passe ouer.
                        Upon the .xxv. day of Octobre, dyuers of the burgeysys &amp; rulers of the cytye of Parys, as Iohn̄ Guyffarde, Nycholas Poret, &amp; other to the noū
                           bre of .xix. persones, by the cōmaundement of the regēt were arested &amp; sent vnto pryson / and so remayned by the space of .iiii. dayes. wherfore the frē
                           des of the sayd prysoners yode vnto the prouoste of the marchaūtes than named Iohn̄ Culdoe, and requyred hym to make labour with other vnto the regent than beyng at Louure, for the delyuery of theyr frēdes, or at the lest to knowe the cause of theyr inprysonement / whyche requeste ye prouost and other executed. It was answered to them by the regēt, that vppon the morowe he wolde be at theyr commō halle / where before the comynaltye yt cause of theyr inprysonement shulde be shewed. And yf than the cytezyns thoughte good to haue them sette at large / he wolde therwyth holde hym contented. At whyche houre apoynted, the regente came vnto the sayde halle / and there shewed that one named Iohn̄ Damyens, whyche hadde maryed the doughter of Iohn̄ Restable one of the sayd prysoners, hadde caused hys sayd father &amp; the other, yt they had allyed theym with the kyng of Nauern cōtrary theyr allegeaūce / wherfore he thought they had deserued to dye. But for the fauoure that he owed vnto the cytye &amp; to them, for they were of good substaūce / he wold nat do any thynge to theym tyll they were enquered of by theyr neyghbours. After the whyche declaracion thus made by the regēt / euery man fered to speke any more for theym, but suffered the lawe to haue hys course. Howe be it in the ende they were acquyted of that treason, and fynally delyuered by the ende of the nexte moneth.
                        Uppō the thyrde daye of Decēbre, entred into Parys the cardinalles of Pierregort &amp; of Urgell, to treate a cō
                           corde and peace betwene the regente &amp; the kyng of Nauerne. But in cōclusyon nothynge they sped of that they came for / wherefore they retourned vnto Auynyon. In whyche retourne they were robbed of great substaūce / wherof Englyshmen bare the disclaū
                           der. And thus thys grudge hāgynge betwene the kyng &amp; the regēt / many robberyes &amp; other harmes were done vnto dyuers townes in Fraūce, to ye greate enpouerysshynge of the peple of that lande, and to the greate enrychynge of suche Englyshemē as thā were there abydynge in dayely warres, bothe wyth the kynge of Nauerne &amp; also in Brytayne.
                        For shortely after thys, the foresayde syr Roberte Knolles and other Englysshemen wanne the towne of Ancer and other, lyke as in the thre and thyrty yere of kynge Edwarde is before more at lengthe declared.
                        In ye moneth of May &amp; .xix. day of

the same / ye regēt for tydynges which he had receyued from hys father out of England, by the reporte of ye archebysshop of Sēs &amp; other / assēbled many of ye good townes at Paris. But ye ways were so stopped by mē of warre he was fayne to tary tyll the .xxv. day of the sayd moneth folowynge. At whyche season was shewed to ye people there assembled, that the kyng of Englande to haue a fynall concorde with ye kyng of Fraunce, wolde haue ouer and aboue hys raunsome, ye duchy of Normandy, ye duchy of Guyā, the duchy of Exanctes, the cytye of Ageu, the cytye of Carbe, the cytye of Pierregort, the cytye of Lymoges, ye cytye of Caours, with all the dyoces of the sayde cytyes belōgyng / the erledomes of Bygorre, of Poytyers, of Aniowe, and of Mayne, of Thorayn of Bouloyne, of Guynys, of Poūtesses, or Pountyeu / ye townes of Moū
                           struell, of Calays, &amp; of Marquet / with all appertenauntes to the sayde duchys, erledomes, cytyes, and townes belongynge / them to enioye and holde wythout feawte or homage for them doynge, with many other thynges to the kyng of Englandes great aduauntage. whyche tydynges were ryght dyspleasaunt vnto all that cō
                           pany / in so moch that they answered that the sayd treaty was neyther honorable nor profytable. And rather thā the kyng shuld bynde hym &amp; hys lande to suche inconuenience / they wolde prepare to make sharpe warre agayne Englande. wyth whyche answere the sayde assemble was dyssolued.
                        Upon the .xxviii. day of May, the regent reassembled the sayde people / where it was condyscended that the nobles of the realme with a certayne persones euery man after hys astate, shuld serue the regent in hys warres by ye space of a moneth at theyr owne propre costes. And the cytye of Parys graūted to fynde to hym at theyr charge .vi.C. speres, iiii.C. archers, &amp; a .M. of other sowdyours. And for so moche as ye other good townes wold nat graūt any subsydie tyll they had spokē with theyr cōmynaltyes / therfore they were licēced to deꝑte home, and to brynge reporte agayn within xiiii. dayes. At whych season they shewed vnto ye regent, yt theyr countreys were so pylled &amp; wasted by the kynge of Nauerne and Englyshemen, yt the people myght nothyng ayde hym as they thought to haue done. wherfore with moche payne they graūted to hī viii.M. mē for .iii. monethes.
                        In the begynnyng of the moneth of Iuny, ye regent with a stronge power sped hym towarde Meleō where the kynge of Nauerne laye with hys people / so that the kyng occupied the coūtrey toward Byeir, and ye regent y• coūtrey towarde Brye. where both hostes thus lyenge withoute notary feate of warre / a treatye of accorde was yet agayne moued at lēgthe, by agrement of ye Parysyens, accorded moche lyke vnto the former accorde concluded at Parys. So yt by mediacyō of certayn tēporall lordes of both hostes, yt sayd princes agreed to mete at Mēlane / and there to cōclude the sayd peace. where about the .xx. daye of August, wyth hostage delyuered vpon both partyes / the sayd prynces mette / &amp; after rode vnto Pountoyse, where they were both lodged within the castell / where bothe theyr coūsayles were assygned to mete for the per fyghtyng of thys accorde. But so it was yt for suche lādes as shuld be assygned vnto ye kyng, they cowde nat agre. wherfore ye regēt in cōclusyō sēt vnto the erle of Stāps or Escamps, chargyng hī to say, yt he to ye entent to haue his good wyl, had offered vnto hym reasonable offers.
                        
                           whyche yf he wolde accepte, he wolde be fayne therof / and yf nat, he let hym vnderstāde yt he shulde haue no peace wyth hym whyle he lyued. By reason of whyche message, ye coū
                           sayles on bothe partyes conceyued none other, but that this treaty shuld haue concluded no amyte nor peace. But howe it was, by counsayll or of hys owne lyberalyte, whan the kyng had degested this mater in his mynd by all that nyght folowynge / he on ye morowe sent for the counsayll of the regent / &amp; wylled them to shewe vnto the regēt, that he consydered well in hys mynde the great daunger &amp; mysery whyche the realme of Fraunce stode in. wherfore he beyng of the naturall house of Fraūce, and one of ye Flouredelyce / ought to se ye mayntenaunce of the honour of the same. And for that that no ruyne of the sayde realme shulde to hym (yf any fell) after be are

                           ted / therfore he was cōtented to set a parte all suche great offers &amp; promyses, as to hym before tyme had ben offered &amp; promysed / &amp; to holde hym onely contented wyth hys owne righte as he before tymes had enioyed. And to ye ende that thys hys wyll &amp; pleasure myght to the people be knowen / he wylled the regent that the people of that towne of Poū
                           toyse shuld be assembled in the court of that castell, that he myghte declare it to them in propre persone. The whych accordyng to his mynde was done. All whyche rehersall he made before the regēt and comynalte of the towne / promysyng there to delyuer out of hys possessiō all suche townes, castelles, and holdys, as he had won syn he stode enemye to the crowne of Fraūce / &amp; to become true subiecte vnto the kyng, &amp; louyng neuewe and frēde vnto ye regēt frome yt daye foreward. wherof the regēt &amp; all the cōmons were very glad &amp; ioyfull all be it that some trusted lytle to this accorde, nor yet to ye cōtinuaūce therof / consyderynge the manyfolde accordes whych before tymes had ben betwene them cōcluded. After which accorde thus ended / the kynge wyth hys people retourned to M

                        ACcordyng to ye appoyntmēte made at Pountoyse betwene the kyng and ye regēt / vpon the fyrste day of Septembre &amp; begynnyng of ye x. yere of kyng Iohn̄, the sayd kynge &amp; regent met at Parys / where atwen them was holden famylyer cōpany, and great kyndenesse shewed vppon eyther partye. There also they counceyled how they shulde withstāde the kyng of Englande, whych entēded to entre Fraunce shortely after wyth a strōge power. And after many amytees and frendely dealynges betwen thē executed / ye kyng rode to Meleō to delyuer that towne and castel into the regentes possessyon as the story sheweth. But whā he was cōmyn thyther, were it with hys wyl or cōtrary / the sowdyours toke greuouse tolles of all wynes and other marchaundyses that passed that waye / whyche after was knowen to be for ye wage &amp; sowde of the Nauaroys and Englisshemen, whych helde the sayd towne and castell. And so yt Frenchmē were constrayned to paye the wages of theyr enemyes / whyche greued them very sore, consyderynge that manyfolde harmes and pyllages of theym before were receyued. And after the kyng had auoyded the sayde sowdyours / he departed &amp; rode vnto Maūt leuyng Creyell in the possessiō of Englyshmen &amp; other. And ouer these manyfolde myseryes and myschyeues

thus fallyng in the realme of Fraūce / there fell so great habundaūce of water in the Heruest season, that ye corne was loste / so that it rose to an hyghe pryce to the greate damage of the comon people.
                        And in the moneth of Nouembre folowyng / the kynge of Englande, with prynce Edwarde &amp; other many lordes, with a strōge power lāded at Calays / &amp; so perced Fraunce by Artoys in Pycardy &amp; Uermendoys, &amp; subdued the coūtrees before hym tyll he came to Reynes, lyke as before is shewed in the .xxxiiii. &amp; .xxxv. yeres of kyng Edward / where all thys mater wyth ye tenoure of the peace betwene the sayde kynges of Englande and of Fraunce is more at lengthe declared.
                        The laste daye of the moneth of Decembre, one Marten of Pysdo burgeyse of Parys, was drawē vnto the place of iugemēt / &amp; there vpon a scaffolde had fyrste hys armes cutte of &amp; after hys legges by the thyes, &amp; lastly hys hed / &amp; than he was quartered, &amp; hys .iiii. quarters sette vppon iiii. pryncypall gates of the cytye, &amp; hys hede sette vpō the pyllory. The cause of thys iugemente was, for so moche as one called Denysot Palmer, to whome he had discouered his coūsayll, and caused hym to be as an accessary in all hys workes / had accused hym that the sayd Marten had agreed &amp; couenaunted with certayne offycers &amp; capytaynes of the kyng of Nauern̄, that they at a tyme appoynted shuld haue entred the cytye of Parys, &amp; to haue slayne the regente &amp; other, &amp; to haue had the cytye at theyr rule and pleasure. And so the season thā of ye .x. yere tyl yt moneth of Iuly, passed in the warres &amp; treaty before touched / so that the .viii. day of Iuly, the Frenche kyng lāded at Calays, &amp; there taryed as prysoner tyl the .xxv. daye of Octobre folowynge, as before in ye .xxxiiii. yere of kyng Edward is more playnly shewed.
                        Than vpon the .xxix. day of Octobre and begynnynge of hys .xi. yere / kyng Iohn̄ came to saynte Omers, where he taryed tyll the fourth daye of Nouembre. And the .xi. day of December he came vnto saynte Denys / where vnto hym vpō ye .xii. day came the kynge of Nauerne, whyche had nat sene hym sen he was delyuered from pryson / &amp; brought with hym certayne hostages whyche the Frenche kynge had sente vnto hym for hys saufegarde / puttynge hym holy in ye Frēche kynges grace &amp; mercy. And vpon the morowe folowyng, he was newly sworne vnto the kynge to be hys trew &amp; faythfull sonne &amp; subiect / and the kyng agayn vnto hym, to be hys kynde father &amp; good &amp; gracyous soueraygne lorde. And forthe wyth were sworne the duke of Normandy &amp; Philip brother vnto the sayd kyng of Nauerne, to maynteyne all couenauntes made &amp; to be made betwene the sayd .ii. kynges / so that they were fynisshed &amp; cōcluded by the .xviii. day of Ianuary nexte folowyng. And soone after retourned the sayd kyng of Nauerne vnto Maunt. And kyng Iohn̄ vpon the .xiiii. daye of December wyth great tryumphe was receyued into Parys.
                        And whanne he was comyn vnto hys palays, the prouost of marchauntes wyth certayne burgeyses of the cytye, in the name of the comynaltye of the same, presented hym with a present to the value of a .M. marke sterlynge.
                        Upon a tuysdaye beyng the fyrste day of Iuly, was foughten a batayll at Parys betwene two knyghtes / wherof the appellaunte was named syr Foukes Dorciat, and the defendaūt syr Maugot Mawbert. whych

appellaūt was sore vexed with a feuer quarteyne / by reason wherof and of the great hete that ye day appered, after longe fyght the sayd appellaūt lyght from hys horse for hys refresshemēt / wherfore hys frendes of hym were in great doute. But his enemye was also so sore trauayled, yt what for hete &amp; laboure he was also ouercome, &amp; was lykely to haue fallen frō hys horse / and or he myght be taken downe he swowned &amp; dyed.
                        whan syr Fowkes was ware of ye feblenesse of hys enemye anon as he might he dressed hym on fote toward hys aduersary, &amp; fande hym starke dede / whyche by lycēce of the kynge was after had out of the feelde, and secretlo buryed / &amp; the sayde syr Fowkes for feblenesse was by hys frēdes ladde vnto hys lodgyng.
                        In the .xii. yere of kynge Iohn̄ &amp; xxi. day of Nouembre, Phylyp duke of Burgoyn, erle of Artoys, of Aluerne, and of Boloyngn, a chylde of the age of .xiiii. yeres or lesse, dyed at a town nere vnto Rome called Guyō By reason of whose deth kyng Iohn̄ as nexte heyre had after possession of al the sayd lādes, &amp; toke possiō therof shortly after.
                        In the .xiiii. yere of the reygne of kyng Iohn̄ &amp; thyrd day of Ianuary / he for specyall causes hym mouyng, as for the enlargyng of his sonne the duke of Orleaunce &amp; other yet pledges for hys raūsome, toke shyppyng at Boloyne, &amp; so sayled into Englād, and arryued at Douer the .vi, day of the sayde moneth / and after yode to Eltham, and from thēs was cōueyed vnto Lōdon, as before is shewed in the .xxxvii. yere of kyng Edward. In tyme of whose there beyng / syr Barthrā de Glaycon made warre vpō the kynge of Nauerne, &amp; wan from hym the towne of Maunt in Normandy. And by the duke of Normādy soone after was wonne from the sayd kyng the towne of Mēlēce. within ye which were taken dyuers Parysyens, that shortly after for theyr infidelite were put in execuciō at Parys. And thus the warre betwene the kynges of Fraūce &amp; Nauerne was newly begō. Than kynge Iohn̄ beyng as before is sayde in Englande / a greuous malady toke hym in the begynnynge of Marche, of the whyche he dyed at London vpō the .viii. daye of Apryll folowynge / &amp; so wyth great honoure and solempnyte cōueyed to the sees syde, and there shypped, &amp; thā in processe caryed into Fraunce.
                        where vpon the .vii. day of May, and yere of our lorde god .M.CCC.lxiiii. he was solempnely enterred in the monastery of saynt Denys / whā he had reygned .xiii. yeres .vii. monethes and odde dayes / leuynge after hym thre sonnes, that is to say Charles, whych was kyng after hym, Lewys, and Phylyp.
                        
                           CArolus or Charles ye .vi. of that name or .v. after som writers, ye eldest sonne of kyng Iohn̄ / beganne hys reygne ouer the realme of Fraūce, the .ix. day of Apryll, in the begynnynge of the yere of our lorde god .M.CCC.lxiiii and the .xxviii. yere of Edwarde the the .iii. than kynge of Englande / and was crowned with dame Iane hys wyfe at Raynes the .xix. day of May folowynge
                        In thys fyrste yere syr Barthran de Glaycon lyeutenaunt of the sayde Charles in Normādy, fought with a capytayne of the kynge of Nauerne named le Captall de Bueffe, nere vnto a place called Cocherell, nere vnto the crosse of saynte Lyeffroy / in

whiche fyght the sayd Captall was scomfited and great noumbre of his people taken and slayne, hym selfe chased &amp; taken / for whome the frenche kynge gaue after vnto the sayde syr Barthrā the Erledam of Longeuyle. And whā he had receyued him / he sent him vnto a strōge pryson called the Merchy in Meaux.
                        At Myghelmas folowynge / the duke of Brytayne syr Charlys de Bloyes, and syr Iohn̄ de Moūtfort sonne and heyre to the fore named sir Iohn̄ Mountforde before dede, whiche by a longe season bothe father &amp; the sonne had holden warre with the sayd syr Charles, met in playne batayle / in y• which as before is shewed in the .xxxviii. yere of king Edwarde, the sayde syr Charles was slayne &amp; dyuers noble men of Fraunce with him. In the moneth of Iuny and seconde yere of this Charlys, an other accorde was yet concluded atwene this Charles and the kynge of Nauerne. By reason of whiche accorde, the Captall of Bueffe was clerely delyuered, and Maunt and Menlene agayne also to the kynge restored. And ouer that to the kynge of Nauerne was geuyn for a recompensement, the Erledome of Longeuyle, whiche as aboue is sayd the frenche kyng had gyuen vnto syr Barthran de Glaycon, for to haue the Captall to his prisoner. And also to the sayde kynge of Nauerne was gyuen the lordshyppe of Mountpyller. And in the moneth of February began the warre in Spayne, where prince Edwarde ayded Peter kyng of ye lande, as before is shewed ī the .xl. and .xlii. yeres of kynge Edwarde.
                        In the .iiii. yere, the peace atwene the kynges of Englande &amp; of Fraūce began to breke, by meanes of the erle of Armenake &amp; other, as in the .xlii. yere of kynge Edwarde is before shewed. And in the moneth of Decembre and the sayd yere, the quene was lyghted of a man Chylde in the Hostell of saynt Paule / the whiche was after christened with excedynge solempnyte ouer other before passed, in the churche of saint Paule in Parys, the .vi. day of Decembre of the cardinal of Parys. To whome were godfathers the erles of Mountmerency and of Dampmartyn, &amp; godmother Iane quene of Euroux / and bare the name of Charlys after the erle of Mountmerency. In the .v. yere of this Charlys, he called his counsell of parlyament at Parys. Durynge the whiche, the appellacyons of the erle of armenake and other purposed ageyne prynce Edwarde, were publysshed and radde / &amp; the answeres of the said prince vpon the sayd appellacyons made, whiche I ouerpasse for length of the mater. But the conclusyon was, that the prince had broken the peas and couenauntes of the same as they there demyd. wherfore all suche townes &amp; holdes as the frenche kyng had gotten, he shulde them retayne / &amp; make warre vpon the kynge of Englande for the recouery of the other. where vpon kynge Charles in the moneth of Iuly folowyng, rode vnto Roan, and there rygged his nauye / entendynge as sayth the frenche historye, to haue made warre vpon Englād / and to haue sent thyther his yongest brother Philippe than duke of Burgoyne with a stronge armye. But whyle he was there besyed about his purpose / the duke of Lancastre arryued with a strong power at Caleys / and so passed to Tyrwyn, &amp; so vnto Ayr. wherfore kynge Charlys then chaunged his purpose, and sent his sayde brother into those ꝑties. Then by that season that ye sayd duke was prepared with hys people / the englysshemen

were comyn vnto Arde. And the frenche men spedde them in suche wyse, that they logged thē the xxiiii. day of Auguste vpon the moū
                           tayne of Tournehawe nere vnto Arde / so that both hoostes were lodgyd within an englysshe myle. Atwene whom were dayly bekeringes and small skyrmysshes. All whyche season the Frenche kyng taryed styll aboute Rowan.
                        Than the king of Nauerne, whiche by a longe season had dwellyd in Nauerne, came by shyppe into Constantyne / and sent vnto kynge Charlys yt if he were so pleased, he wolde gladly come vnto hym for to shewe to him his mynde. wherfore the king sent vnto hym as hostagys, the erle of Salebruge, the deane of Parys, with .ii. other noble men / the whyche the kynge of Nauerne wolde nat accepte. In the moneth of Septembre and vpon the .xii. day / when the duke of Burgoyne had lyen as before is sayd nere vnto the englysshe hooste, he that day remoued his people, and so went vnto Hesden. And the Englisshe hoost remoued to Caux &amp; other places, as before I haue shewed to you in the .xliii. yere of kynge Edwarde, with other thynges apperteyninge vnto the same mater. And in the sayd moneth of Septembre, kynge Charles manned and vitayled certayne galeys &amp; other shyppes / and sent them into walys, and so to haue entred into Englāde. But they retourned with lytle worshippe / natwithstandynge that he had .ii. noble men of walys named Owan and Iames wynne, whiche made to him faste promesse of great thynges, by reason that they were enemyes vnto the kyng of Englande. For this and for other charges, the kynge called a conuocacyon of the temporalte and spiritualte at Parys. where to mayntayne hys warres, was graunted to hym of all thynge bought &amp; so
                              •
                           de excepte vitayle, the .iiii. peny / so that all thynge that was solde by retayle, the seller shuld pay the exaccion / and that whyche was solde by greate, the byer shulde paye the sayd exaccion. And the spiritualte graunted a dyme to be payed in .ii. halfe yeres. And the lordes and gentylmen were stynted at a certaintye, after the value of theyr landes. In the moneth of February, the kyng sent vnto the kynge of Nauerne than beynge at Chierbourgth certayne messyngers, to perfyght an amyte atwene them, leste he toke party agayne hym with the Englysshemen. But thys treatye contynued a longe season / so that ī the .vi. yere &amp; moneth of Iune, the kynge of Nauerne hauyng sufficient hostages, came to the frenche kynge to Uernon. where in conclusion the kynge of Nauerne made his homage vnto the frenche kyng, and became there his feodary / wherof the Frenchemen made moche ioye. After whiche accorde / the sayde kynge of Nauerne the thirde day folowing toke his leaue of the kynge, and so rode vnto Eureux. All which season ye warre was cōtynued by Englisshemen within the realme of Fraunce &amp; prouince of Brytayne, as before is expressed in the .xliiii.xlv.xlvi. yeres of kynge Edwarde.
                        In the .vii. yere and moneth of Auguste / the duke of Braban with many nobles of Fraunce, mette in playne batayll with ye duke of Iuillers &amp; the duke of Guellre. In which batayll after cruell fyght, the duke of Braban was chased / and vpō his syde slayne the erle of saynt Poule, with many other noble men, whiche the story nameth nat. And vpon the other syde was also slayne the duke of Guellre, with many other vpon

that partye.
                        IN the .xi. yere of kyng Charles &amp; moneth of Maye / he assembled his great coūsell of parlyament at Parys. where amonge many actes made for ye weale of his realme / he with assente of his lordes and cō
                           mons there assembled,At what age the heyre to the crown of Fraūce shuld be crowned. enacted for a lawe after that day to be contynued, that al heyres to ye crowne of Fraūce theyr fathers beynge dede, may be crowned as kynges of Fraunce so soone as they attayned vnto the age of .xiiii. yeres. And in this yere was the treatye of peace laboured by the two cardynalles sent from the pope, as before is shewed in the .xlix. yere of kynge Edwarde. After whyche treatye nat concluded / the kynge of Englande loste dayly of hys landes in Fraunce. For in the moneth of August folowyng, ye duke of Berry, the duke of Angeo, and many other lordes to them assygned in dyuers places, as in Guyan, Angeo, and Mayne / gate and wanne from the Englysshemen many coūtreys, townes, and castels / as Pierregort, Rouerge, Caoursyn, Bigorre, Basyndas, Berregart, Daimet / with many other townes and holdes, whyche wolde aske a lōge leysour to reherce, to the noumbre of .vi. score and .xiiii. what of townes, castelles, and other holdes / whiche in shorte whyle were wonne frome the Englysshemen, in the parties of Fraunce and Brytayne.
                        In the .xiii. yere of this Charles / the Emperour of Rome &amp; Almayne named Charles the .iiii. of that name, came into Fraūce by Cambray, to do certayne pylgrymages at saint Denys and elles where / and so was conueyed with honorable men, as the lorde of Cousy and other, vnto saynt Quintyne / where he taryed Chrystmas daye.

Than he rode to Senlys / where he was mette with the dukes of Berry and of Burgoyne, bretherne of the Frenche kynge, and many other, as bisshoppes and other lordes. And ye shall vnderstande that all suche as rode in the companyes of these forsayde dukes, except bysshops and preestes, rode in theyr lyuereys. As the companye fyrste of the duke of Burbon brother vnto the quene, to the noumbre of .CCC. men, were all cladde in whyte and blewe. The company of the .ii. other dukes, the noumbre of .v.C. men, in blacke and russet / that is to meane the erles and other lordes in clothe of golde, the knyghtes in veluet, the gentylmen in damaske and sattyn, and the yemen in clothe. Thanne from Senlys he was brought vnto Louuris / where mette with hym the duke of Barre, with a companye of CC. horse, and his company cladde in grene and redde. And from thens he was had to saynte Denys vpon the thyrde day of Ianuary / whither the king sent to him a chayre rychely garnysshed, for so moche as he was vexed with the goute. And the quene sente to hym an horse lytter with .ii. whyte palfreys: where he was also mette with a great companye of bysshoppes and other spirituall men, as abbottes, priours, and other / and taryed there .ii. dayes.
                        Upon the .v. day of Ianuary beynge monday, he rode towarde Parys. But or he were halfe a myle frō saynte Denys, he was mette with the prouoste of the marchauntes, with a cōpany of .xv.C. horse, yt cytezens being cladde in whyte and violette / and so rodde before hym tyll

And so the Frenche kynge rydinge in the myddes, passed thoroughe the hygh stretes of Paris tyll they came to the kingꝭ palays. where he was lodged with all honoure / &amp; after fested with the kinge and the quene by the space of .xvi. dayes. whiche terme endyd, like as with all honoure he was conueyed into the lande / so with great honour and ryche gyftes he was agayne conueyed out of the lande.
                        In the moneth of Februarye folowynge and the .vi. daye, dyed the quene of Fraunce in the hostell of saynt Poule in Parys / and after buryed with great solempnyte and honoure in the monastery of saynt Denys. In the moneth of Marche the kynge receyued letters from certeyn lordes of hys lande / in the whyche was conteygned that the kynge of Nauerne had imagened and conspired with one Iaquet de rue his chā
                           berlayne, for to poyson hym / the whiche Iaquet was than comyn into Fraunce to execute his cursed purpose. wherfore the Frenche kynge layed suche wayte for hym, that he was taken / and founden vpon hym a byll of certayne instruccions, howe he shulde behaue hym selfe in accomplysshyng his euyll purpose. Than he was brought vnto the kinges presence / to whome he confessed the circumstaunce of all his treason to be done at the commaundement &amp; counsell of the kyng of Nauerne. Soone after the eldest sonne of the kynge of Nauerne, whiche was newely commyn into Normandy, sent vnto king Charles / shewynge to hym that if it were his pleasure, he wolde gladlye come vnto hys presence for to speke with hym / with that he myght haue a sure safeconduyt for hym, and all suche as he shulde brynge with him. The whiche to hym was graunted / and vpō the same came vnto Selys where the kynge than was. And after he had comoned a season with ye kynge / he made to hym requeste for the delyuere of the foresaid Iaket de Rue / layenge for hym sondrye excuses. But whanne the kynge hadde caused the sayd Iaket to be brought forthe before the sayde sonne of the kynge of Nauerne named syr Charlys / he auouched suche thynges before hym that he coude nat denaye, but that his father had commytted many and sondry treasons, as well agayne kynge Iohn̄ as nowe agayne kyng Charles hys sonne. wherfore after diuers assembles and counsels hadde vpon this matter / the kynge and the said sir Charles agreed, that all suche townes and holdes as the sayd kynge of Nauerne had within Normandy, shulde be delyuered vnto ye duke of Burgoyne to the Frenche kynges vse. And for that ꝓmesse shulde be truely parfourmed / ye king firste sware the said syr Charles / and after many of the capitaynes whiche had the rule of the sayd townes and castelles. And for so moche as the sayd syr Charles had there presence

with hym a capitayne named sir Fernande de Oyens, in whose guyding many of the sayde holdes than were, and suspected him that he wolde nat perfourme the sayd promesse / therfore he caused hym to be arested, and to be had vnto prison, tyll the holdes beynge vnder hys guydynge were clerely deliuered. Upon which agrement thus concluded and sworne / ye duke of Burgoyne with the sayd sir Charles and the sayd syr Fernande as a prisoner was sent into Normandye, with a conuenyent army. where wyth awe and fauoure the duke in processe of tyme had to hym delyuered, all suche townes and holdes as the kynge of Nauerne there had / excepte the towne and castell of Chirebourgth▪ In whiche passe tyme and season was also taken in a towne called Bretnell, a secretary to the kyng of Nauerne, with certayne wrytynges beynge in a coffer within the chambre. By reason of whiche wrytynges, and also by the confessyon of the partye / many mo thynges concernyng the confessyon of Iaket de Rue was than manifested and approued: which secretary was named maister Peter de Tertre a frenchman borne. But he had serued the kynge of Nauerne by the more terme of hys lyfe. Upon this confessyon made and wryten by the sayde secretary / the kinge called his court of parlyament.

And whan the kyng had receyued into his possession the foresayde holdes belongynge vnto the kynge of Nauerne, the whiche so often had rebelled agayne his father &amp; hym / he was coūselled by his lordes that he shulde throwe to grounde diuers of the sayd castelles / lest ye king of Nauerne them recouered agayne, and by meane of theyr forces worke vnto hym and his realme newe dyspleasures. By reason of which counsell, the kynge made euen with the grounde these fortresses folowynge.

But ye erle beyng warned therof / wyth ayde of Bruges &amp; of Frāk and other, māned out a company agayn the other, and mette with them in playne felde / and after a sharpe skyrmysshe, put theym of Gaūt to flyght, &amp; slewe of them dyuers, &amp; toke of them certayne prysoners / &amp; pursued them vnto the town of Ipre, and layed syege to the same. whan the heddes of the towne knew that the erle was there in propre parsone / vnder a certayne apoyntement they opened the gates, and receyued hym in. But many of hys enemyes were fled vnto Courtray. And whan the erle had rested hym in y• towne .ii. dayes, &amp; done there some execucyō / he departed thēs and rode vnto Bruges and helde hym there. In whyche season the other whych as aboue is sayd were fled vnto Courtray / fell at varyaunce within theym selfe, &amp; slewe theyr capytayne / &amp; after fled ye towne &amp; shyfted euery man for hym selfe.

And whā ye erle was asserteyned of that dede, &amp; howe the town of Courtray was tourned vnto hys party / anone he assembled of other townes, &amp; also of that, and of Ipre, so moche that hys hoste was estemed at lx.M. mē. wyth the whiche he spedde hym vnto Gaunte, &amp; layed a stronge syege there about. But by the deth of the French kyng whych dyed shortly after, the erle was fayne to chaunge hys mynde, &amp; to remoue hys syege or elles, as some wryters reporte, for strength of the sayde towne, whyche myght nat lyghtly be gottē, for lacke of good vpon ye erles partye to maynteyne that syege.Dethe of kyng Charles Thā in the moneth of Septembre and .xxvi. daye of the same / kynge Charles dyed at his manoyr called playsance sur Marne / &amp; was buryed by his wyfe in the monastery of saynt Denys, whan he had reygned .xv. yeres and .vi. monethes wyth odde dayes / leuynge after hym iii. sonnes, Charles which was kyng after hym, and Lewys that he hadde made erle of Ualoys and after duke of Angeowe, and Phylyppe erle of Poytyers.

                        staunce hys wyfe / whyche was the doughter of Peter ryghtfull kynge of Spayne, as in the .xl. yere of kyng Edward the thyrde is more playnly declared. whan the sayde duke was vpon that other syde of the see / there came vnto hym the kynge of Portyngale wyth a stronge army, and so entred the terrytory of Spayne. But whether it were of the Englishe men longe or of the Portyngaleys / moche harme was done to the Spanyardes, in robbynge and pyllyng of the countrey / whyche was cause of grudge betwene the kyng of Portyngale and the duke / and caused many Spanyardes whyche oughte to thē good wyll to wythdrawe and depart from them. In reformacyō of which ille, certayn persones aswel English as Portyngaleys that were founde gyltye of suche robbery, were putte vnto deth / by meane whereof the other fered so, that where by that meane the kynge and the duke were before put to great afterdeale, by reasō of reformacyon of that ille they gat dayly vppon theyr enemyes / so that in processe of tyme folowyng, ye kyng of Spayne was dryuen of necessyte to treate wyth the duke of a peace &amp; concorde. Of the whyche peace as wytnesseth Polycronycon in hys last boke and .vii. chapyter / the condyciō was, that fyrste for a fynall concorde the kynge of Spayne shuld marye ye duke eldest doughter name Cōstaūce and that done he shulde gyue vnto ye duke in recōpensacyon of hys costes, so many wedges of golde as shulde charge or lade .viii. charettes / and ouer that yerely durynge the lyues of the sayde duke and hys wyfe, he shuld at hys propre coste and charge delyuer to the dukes assygneys .x.M. marke of golde wythin ye towne of Bayon.
                     And after thys peace was stablysshed, and suertyes taken for the perfourmaunce of the same / the duke departed wyth the kynge of Portyngale. To whome shortelye after he maryed hys second doughter named dame Anne.
                     In thys yere also for cruel warre whyche the Turkes made agayne the Ianueys or men of Ieane / they requyred ayde of the kynges of Englande and Fraunce. For whyche cause oute of Englande was sente a noble warryour called erle of Alby wyth two thousande of archers / and

out of Fraunce the duke of Burbon and the erle of Ewe, wyth .xv.C. speres. The whych kept theyr iournay tyll they came vnto a cytye in Barbary named Thunys, &amp; somtyme belongynge to the sayde Ianuays. where the sayd Englyshe &amp; Frenchemen bare them so manfully wyth the ayde of ye Ianuayes, that in proces of tyme they wanne ye sayde cytye frō the Turkes, and put ye Ianuayes agayne in possessyon therof / &amp; toke of theym many prysoners, the whyche were exchaunged for chrysten prysoners before taken / and ouer that forsed the sayd Sarazyns to yelde vnto the Ianuayes .x.M. ducates of gold, for confyrmacyon of a peace for a certayne tyme. But the French cronycle sayth, that for so moche as the duke of Burbon hadde vnderstandynge yt the duke of Lancaster made warre vpon kyng Iohn̄ of Spayn / he therfore lefte thys iournay and ayded hī agayne the sayde duke of Lancaster to hys lytle honour.
                     But howe so euer it was / many of the Englyshmē were loste in those countreys by reason of the flyxe and other sykenesses. Also Antoninus sayeth, that the Sarazyns at thys iourney were nat dyspossessed of the cytye of Thunys / but for a trewes to be hadde for two yeres, they graunted vnto the chrysten men a certayne summe of money, and restytucyon of many chrysten prysoners.

In the whyche were it wyth stroke or other myshap / the sayd erle receyued there hys dethes wounde &amp; dyed shortly after.
                     In this yere also &amp; moneth of Iuny / a bakers man berynge a basket full of horsebrede to serue hys maysters customers in Fletestrete / whanne he came foreagayn the bysshop of Salysburyes place standynge in Salysbury aley, a seruaunt of the bysshoppes starte vnto the basket and toke oute one of the louys. And for the baker wolde agayne haue recouered hys horse lofe / ye bysshoppes seruaūt wyth hys dagger brake the bakers hed. Than came the inhabytauntes of the strete, &amp; wolde haue broughte the yoman vnto warde for brekynge of the kynges peace. But he was rescowed by hys felowes / and so hadde vnto the bysshoppes palays, whyche that daye stoode treasourer of Englande.
                     For this rescous the people beyng in a fury / in greate multytude gathered aboute the palays, and wolde haue entred parforce to haue set out the yoman.
                     Agayn whome the bysshoppes seruaūtes made resistēce / so yt ye rumour

grewe more and more. And the peple of the cytye, aswell suche as were of yll dysposycion as other, encreased into a greate noumbre. Fame of thys doyng thā sprāge to ye mayer / which in all haste wyth dyuers aldermen &amp; the shyryues, sped hym thyther to se the peace kepte / &amp; dyd that he cowde to withdrawe the people. But after ye mayer &amp; the offycers of the citie were comyn thyder / the cōmons out of all partyes of the cytye drewe thyder, in moche more multytude thanne they had before / so that ye more they were in noumbre, the worse they were to rule. In so moche that they wold nat be satysfyed, but they myghte haue ye yoman delyuered, whose name was walter Romayne. And for to brynge about theyr foly / they made many assautes at the gates of ye sayd palays, the bysshop hym selfe beynge than at wyndesore. Lastly after many showtes &amp; lyftes at the gates made, by dyscresciō of the mayre &amp; aldermen with other dyscrete comoners of the cytye, the people was mynysshed and sente agayne euery mā to hys dwellynge, &amp; all was set in quyet &amp; reste. whan worde of this came vnto the bisshop, in moch worse maner thā the thynge was in dede / he gyuing light credēce without examinaciō made in the matter, assocyat vnto hym mayster Arundell than archebisshop of yorke and chaūceler of Englāde / &amp; so greuously enfourmed the kyng, that he toke agayne the cytye ryght greuouse dyspleasure / so that in all hast the mayre was sent for to the kynge. At whose commyng was layd vnto his charge great &amp; heynous maters, that he non otherwyse ruled the cytye / but suffered the cytezyns to make suche assautes vppō the kynges hed offycers, to the kynges great dyshonour, &amp; ieopardy of suche great treasoure as he than had of the kynges ī his custody and kepynge. And after broughte vnto the kynges presence / of whome nat wythstādyng hys reasonable excuse before made, he was of the kyng ryght sore blamed &amp; greuously sayde vnto. Thā was the mayre &amp; the sheryues dyscharged of the rule of ye cytie / &amp; the liberties of the same seased into the kynges hādes / &amp; a knyghte of the court called syr Edward Dalīgryge, a good man and fauourable to ye cytezeyns, was made gouernoure of the cytye the .xxi. daye of Iune / &amp; contynued in that offyce to the fyrste daye of Iuly next ensuyng.

And in thys mayres yere also, was a great trāslaciō of bisshoppes. Thys dyspleasure thus hāgyng towarde the cytye / the cytezyns made contynuall labour vnto the kynges grace, by meanes of the quene and of doctour Grauysende than bysshope of London / whych ought theyr especiall fauoures vnto the cytye. By whose meanes the cytezeyns were restored vnto theyr lybertyes, &amp; hadde licence to chose of them selfe a mayre &amp; two shyryues / so that vppon saynt Mathewis daye folowynge, they chose for shyryues Gylberte Manyfolde or Manfelde and Thomas Newyngton / and vppon saynte Edwardes daye kynge and confessoure, they chase for theyr mayre wyllyam Stondon Grocer / whyche by the Lyeutenaunte of the towre were at that tyme admytted and sworne.
                     
                        But yet the kynges dyspleasure was natte reconcyled, nor the cytezeyns admytted vnto hys grace and fauoure.

                     IN the begynnynge of thys mayres yere, and .xix. yere of kynge Rycharde, and .xviii. daye of Nouembre as affermeth ye Frenche cronycle / kyng Rycharde beynge thā at Calays, spowsed or toke to wyfe wythin the churche of saynt Nycholas, Isabel the doughter of Charles the .vi. than kyng of Fraunce. whych lady Isabell as wytnesseth the sayde Frenche story, at the day of hyr marryage was wythin .viii. yeres of age. And as it is regestred in one of ye bokes of guyldehalle of London / the Frenche kynge in propre persone came downe wyth a goodly companye of lordes and knyghtes, vnto a towne called Arde, whyche standeth vppon the vtter border of Pycardy / where wythin hys owne domynyon a ryche and sumptuouse pauylyon was pyght. And in lyke maner a litle beyonde Guynys wythin the english pale, was another lyke pauylyon pyghte for kynge Rycharde / so that betwene the two sayde pauylyons,

was a distaunce of .lxx. pace. And in the mydway atwene bothe, was ordained ye thyrde pauylion / at ye which bothe kinges cōming from eyther of theyr tentes sondry tymes there met, &amp; had communicacion eyther with other / the wayes or distaunce atwene set with certayne persones apoynted standynge in arme .ii. and .ii / the one syde beynge set with Englysshemen, and that other with Frenche. And a certeyne distaūce from eyther of the ii. first sayde pauilyons, stode bothe hoostes of bothe prynces, or suche cō
                        panyes as before either of them was appointed to bryng. Here if I shuld brynge in the dyuers metynges of ye sayd princes, and the curyous seruices that eyther caused other to be fed &amp; serued within eyther of theyr tentes, or of theyr dalyaunce or pastymes continuynge the season of their metynges, and the dyuersyte of the manifolde spices and wynes whiche there was ministred at ye said season, with all ye ryche apparell of the sayde pauilyons &amp; cupbordes garnysshed with plate &amp; rich iewels / it wold aske a lōge tracte of tyme. But who yt is desirous to knowe or here of the cyrcumstaūce of all ye premysses / let him rede ye worke of maister Iohn̄ Froysarde made in Frenche / and there he shall se euery thynge touched in an ordre. And here I shall shortly touch the giftes yt were gyuen of eyther of ye princes &amp; of their lordes. And fyrst king Rychard gaue vnto ye Frenche kynge, an hanap or basyn of golde with an ewer to ye same. Thā againwarde ye Frēche king gaue vnto him iii. stāding cuppes of golde, with couers garnisshed with perle &amp; stone / &amp; a shippe of golde set vpon a bere rychely garnysshed with perle &amp; stone. Than at theyr seconde meting king Rycharde gaue vnto him an ouche set with so fyne stones, yt it was valued at .v.C. marke sterlynge. where agayne the Frenche king gaue vnto him .ii. flaggons of golde / a tablet of golde, and therein an ymage of saint Mychaell rychely garnisshed. Also a tablet of gold with a crucifixe therin well and rychely dyght. Also a tablet of golde with an ymage of the Trynite, rychely set with perle and stone. Also a tablet of gold with an ymage of saynt George, in likewise set with perle and stone. whiche all were valued at the summe of .xv.C. marke. Than king Richarde seyng ye boūte of the Frenche kinge / gaue to hym a bauderyke or coler of golde set with greate dyamantes, rubyes, and balessys, beyng valued at .v.M. mark / the whiche for the preciosyte thereof, that it was of such an excellency and fynesse of stuffe, the Frenche kynge therfore ware it aboute his necke as often as the king and he mette together. Than the Frenche kyng gaue vnto hym an ouche, a spyce plate of golde of great weyght, and valued at .ii.M. marke. Many were the ryche gyftes that were receyued of lordes and ladyes of bothe prynces. Amonge the whiche specially are noted .iii. giftes, whiche kyng Richarde gaue vnto the duke of Orleaūce / for the which he receyued agayne of the duke trebyll the value. For where his were valued at a .M. marke / the dukes were valued at thre thousāde marke. Finally whan ye said princes hadde thus eyther solaced with other, &amp; concluded all maters concernynge the abouesayde maryage / the Frenche kyng delyuered vnto kyng Rycharde dame Isabell his doughter, sayenge these wordes folowynge.
                     Ryght dere beloued sonne, I delyuer here to you the creature yt I most loue ī this worlde next my wife &amp; my sonne / besechynge ye father in heuen,

that it may be to his pleasure, and of the weale of you and youre realme / and that the amyte atwene the .ii. realmes in auoydyng of effusyon of chrysten mens blode, maye be kepte inuyolet for the terme atwene vs cō
                        cluded / whiche terme was .xxx. wynter as expresseth the Frenche Cronycle. After whiche wordes with many thankes giuen vpon eyther parties / preparacyon was made of deꝑtinge. And after kynge Rycharde had conueyed the Frenche kynge towarde Arde / he toke his leaue and returned vnto his wyfe. The which was immediatlye with great honoure conueyed vnto Caleys / and there after to the kyng spoused, as before to you I haue shewed. After the which solempnisacion with al honour ended / the kynge with his yonge wyfe toke shyppyng, and so within short whyle landed at Douer / and from thens sped hym towarde London. wherof the cytezens beynge warned / made out certayne horsemen well appointed in one lyuetye of coloure, with a conysaunce brodered vpon theyr sleues, whereby euery felyshyppe was knowen from other. The whyche with the Mayre and hys bretherne clothed in scarlet, met the kynge and the quene vpon the Blacke hethe / &amp; after due salutacyon and reuerente welcomes vnto theim made by the mouthe of the recorder, the sayd cytezens conueyed the kynge vpon his wey tyll he came to Newyngton: where the kynge commaunded the Mayre with his company to returne to the cytie / for he with hys lordes &amp; ladyes was appointed that nyght to lye at Kenyngton. It was nat longe after but that she was from Kenington brought with great pompe vnto the Towre of London. At whyche season was so exceding prece at London brydge, that by reason therof certayne persones were thruste to deth / amonge the whyche the pryoure of Typtre a place ī Essex was one. And vpon the morowe folowynge, she was conueyed throughe ye cytie with all honoure that myghte be deuysed vnto westmynster / &amp; there crowned quene vpon the sonday beynge than the .viii. day of Ianuary. In the somer folowynge the kynge by sinistre counsell delyuered vp by a poyntement the towne of Breste in Brytayne to the duke / whiche was occasyon of displeasure atwene the kyng and ye duke of Gloucestre hys vncle as in the yere folowyng shalbe more clerely shewed.

                     IN this .xx. yere of kynge Rycharde and moneth of February / the kinge holdynge a sumptuous feest in westmynster halle, many of the soudyours whiche were newely comen from the towne of Brest foresayd, presed into the hall, and kepte a rome together. whiche companye whan the duke of Gloucestre hadde beholden / and frayned and knowen what men they were, and howe the sayde towne was gyuen vppe contrary his knowlege / was therewith in his mynde sore discomforted. In so moche that whan the kynge was entred hys chaumbre, and fewe nere vnto hym, he sayde vnto the kynge: Syr haue ye nat sene the felawes yt
                        
satte in so great noumbre to daye in your halle at suche a table. And the kynge answered yes, and axed of the duke what cōpany it was. To whom the duke answered &amp; saide, Sir these ben youre souldyours comen from Breste / and as nowe haue nothynge to take to, nor knowen at howe to shyfte for theyr lyuynge / and the rather for that as I am enfourmed, they haue benne before tyme euyll payed. Than said ye king it is nat my will but yt they shulde be well payed. And if any haue cause to cōplayne, let them shewe it vnto our tresourer, and they shalbe resonably answered. In resonynge of this mater farther / the duke said vnto the kyng, Syr ye ought to put your body to payne for to wynne a strōge holde or towne by feate of warre, or ye toke vpon you to sell or delyuer any towne or strōge holde gotten with great difficulte, by māhode of your noble progenitours. To this ye kyng with chaūged countenaūce answered &amp; sayd, Uncle how say ye thoses wordes. Than ye duke boldelye recyted ye foresayd wordes. wherunto the king beynge more discontented said, wene ye yt I be a marchaūt or fole to sell my lāde / by saynt Iohn̄ baptist nay. But trothe it is, yt our cosyn the duke of Brytaine hath rendred vnto vs al such sūmes of money as our progenitours lente vnto him or his auncetours, vpon the said towne of Brest. For the whiche, reason &amp; good conscience will yt he haue his towne restored agayne. By meane of whiche wordes thus vttred by the duke / suche rancoure and malyce kyndelyd atwene the kinge &amp; hym, yt it ceased nat tyll the sayde duke was put to dethe by murdre vnlefully. Than the duke apperceyuynge the kinges misledynge by certayne persones about him, entendyng thereof reformacion for ye weale of the kinge and his realme / called vnto him the abbot of saynte Albons, &amp; the abbot &amp; pryour of westmynster, and shewed to them his secrete mynde. By whose counselles he made assemble shortely after at Arundell / to which assemble came at the day appoynted, dyuers lordes bothe spirituall &amp; temporall / as him selfe, the erle of Arundell and other. Also thyther came the erle of Notyngham than marshall of Englande, the erle of warwyke / &amp; of spirituall lordes, the archebisshoppe of Caunterbury, the abbottes of saynte Albones and of westmynster with other.
                     After whyche assemble thus made, and eueryche of theym to other sworne within the castell of Arundel / the .viii. day of August they toke there theyr counsell, and condiscended yts dyuers lordes about the king, as the duke of Lancastre, the duke of yorke and other, shulde be putte from suche auctoryte and rule of the lande as they than bare / and other offycers suche as were thought preiudicial vnto the weale of the lande, shulde be dyscharged and punisshed for theyr demerytes. whan this with many other thynges was amonge them concluded / eueryche of theym departed tyll the tyme of an other metynge atwene theym appoynted. But the erle of Notyngham contrarye his othe and promyse fearing the sequell of the matter / yode shortely after vnto the kynge, and dyscouered vnto hym all the premisses. wherefore the kynge in all haste called a secrete counsell at London in the said erle of Notynghames place, or after some at the place of the erle of Huntyngdone.
                     where it was concludyd yt the sayd erle of Huntyngdone &amp; other, shulde by strengthe fetche vnto the king the erles of Arundell and of warwyke.

                     IN this .xxi. yere of kynge Rycharde / the people of the lande murmured and grudged sore againe the kynge &amp; his counsell / for so moche as the goodes belongynge vnto the crowne, were disperblyd &amp; gyuen to vnworthy persones / by occasyon whereof dyuers charges and exaccyons were put vpon the people. Also for that the chefe rulers aboute the prynce, were of lowe byrthe and of small reputacyon / and the men of honoure were kepte out of fauoure. Also for that the duke of Glouceter was secretely murdred without processe of the lawe / and many thynges elles mysordered by the laste parlyament, whereof the wyte and blame was layed vnto the kynge and other persones after named, as well for wrongefull dysherytynge of sondrye persones at the sayde parlyamente, suche as were menyall seruauntes of the foresayde duke of Gloceter and of the erles of Arundell and of warwyke, contrarye hys owne proclamacyons made concernynge suche maters.

Also where for sheryffes and other offycers of all shyres of Englande, were wonte to be named .iiii. by discrete ꝑsones as iuges &amp; other, of ye whiche the kyng shulde assygne two for the yere folowynge / he of his owne wylle &amp; pleasure wolde refuse them, &amp; chose suche .ii. as hym lyked / 

the which he knewe well wolde lene more to his weale, than to the cōmen weale of this lande or of his subiectes. Also that where before tymes ye kynges of Englande vsed to sende out commyssyons vnto burgeses of cyties &amp; townes, to chose of theyr fre lybertie suche knyghtes of the shyre as they thought mooste wealefull for the comen weale of the sayde shyre &amp; lande / nowe kyng Rycharde wolde appoynte the persones, and wylle them for to chose such as than he named / wherby his singuler causes were preferred, and the commen causes put by. Also kinge Rycharde thoroughe euyll counsell, commaunded by his letters vnto the sheryffes of all shyres fewe excepted, that all persones of honoure within theyr countyes as well spirytuall as temporall, shulde make certayne othes in generall wordes, and ouer that to wryte and seale certayne bondes for perfourmaunce of the sayde othes / and also for blanke chartour, which many men of substaunce were constrayned to seale to theyr great charges. The people contynually murmured and grudgyd, for these iniuryes and many mo, whyche at the tyme of his deposynge were artyculed agayne hym in .xxxviii. sondry artycles / with also the rumoure that ranne vpon hym, that he had letten to ferme the reueneus of ye crowne, to Busshey, Bogot, and Grene / whiche caused as well the noble men of the realme to grudge agayn hym as other of the comon people. Thus cō

At whose enterremente all the chefe lordes of Englande were present. For whom after was foūdyd by dame Blaūche hys wyfe an honorable anniuersary, as before I haue shewed in ye .xliiii. yere of Edwarde the thyrde, whiche of right ought to be set in this place.
                     This yere also aboute the feste of saynt Bartholomew, fell discencyon &amp; discorde bytwene ye duke of Herforde &amp; the duke of Norfolke. wherfore the duke of Herforde accused ye other, that he hadde taken .iiii. thousande marke of the kynges, of suche money as he shulde therwith haue waged certeyne sowdyours at Caleys / whiche he lefte vndone, &amp; toke the same money to hys owne vse. But an other wryter sayth, that as ye sayde two dukes rode vppon a tyme from the parlyament towarde theyr lodgynges / ye duke of Norfolke sayd vnto that other: Syr se you not how varyable the kyng is in his wordes, and how shamefully he putteth his lordes and kynesfolkes to deth, and other exileth and holdeth in pryson. wherfore full necessary it is to take kepe, and not for to truste myche in hys wordes. For without dowte in tyme to come, he wyll by suche lyke meanes brynge vs vnto lyke deth &amp; distruccyon. Of whiche wordes the sayde duke of Herforde accused that other vnto the kynge / wherfore eyther wagyd batayle with other before the kynge. To whom daye of metynge was gyuen to eyther vpon the .xi. daye of September, to fyghte within lystes at Couētre, where all thynge was ordeyned for. At whiche place at ye day assygned thyder came the sayde two dukes, and appered in the felde before the kynges presence, redy to do theyr batayle. But ye kyng anone forbad that fyght / and forthwith exyled the duke of Herforde for x. yeres, and the duke of Norfolk for euer / whiche sentence was shortely

after put in execucyon. Thanne the duke of Herforde sayled into Fraūce and there taryed a season. But for lacke of ayde and comforte he departed thens and came into Brytayne. And the duke of Norfolke passed dyuers countreys / and lastely came vnto the cytie of Uenyce, and there endyd his lyfe. And soone after thys was maister Roger walden a chapeleyne of the kynges, made archebysshoppe of Caunterbury / the whyche was a speciall louer vnto the citie of London, and made great labour for them vnto the kynges grace, ye greuously with them was of newe dyspleased, for so moche as he was enfourmed of them, yt they shulde counsell with other sheriffes to withstāde certayne actes made in the laste parlyament / for yt which the comynaltie of the cytie was endyted with other sheryffes. In redresse wherof / by coū
                        sell of the sayd archebysshoppe, &amp; of maister Robert Braybroke than bisshoppe of Lōdon, the cytezens made a lamentable supplicacyon vnto the kinge. whiche by ayde &amp; fauoure of the sayd two bysshoppes &amp; other louers of ye cytie / ye kinges yre &amp; indignacyon by meane of that lowly supplicacyon was some parte appeased &amp; withdrawen. But yet to contente a ꝑte of ye kinges mynde, many blanke chartours were deuysed &amp; broughte into the cytie / which many of ye most substancyall men of the same were fayne to seale, to theyr payne and charge in conclusyon / yt whiche shortely after was vsed thoroughe all countreys of Englande.

For well I wote &amp; knowlege, &amp; deme, my selfe to be and haue ben vnsufficient &amp; vnable, and also vnprofytable / and for myne open desertes nat vnworthy to be put downe. And I swere vpon ye holy Euāgels here presently with my handes touched, yt I shal neuer repugne to this resygnacyon, dimyssyon, or yeldyng vp / nor neuer inpugne theym in any maner by worde or by dede, by my selfe nor by none other.

                        As who wolde say, they may take exaumple of hym to rule &amp; guyde theyr subiectes. For by the discressyon of a noble &amp; wyse mā beyng in auctorite / many euylles be sequestred and put a parte, and all dyssmilers put vnto sylence.

And all was for lacke of wysedome in the ruler whych demed &amp; taught as a chylde, gyuyng sentēce of wylfulnes and nat of reason.

But of thys parell &amp; daunger we ben delyuered by the especyal helpe &amp; grace of god, Quia vir dominabitur tur in populo / that is to meane, he that is nat a chylde but perfyght in reason.

And therefore nowe I truste the wordes of the wyse man Ecclesiastici decimo shalbe veryfyed in our kynge / sayenge index sapiens iudicabit populum suum, &amp; principatus sensati stabilis erit / that is as sayeth the wyse man, A wyse and dyscrete iuge shall now deme hys people / &amp; the domynyon or lordshyppe of a dyscrete wyse man, shall stande stedfast. wher upon shall than folowe the seconde verse of the same chapyter / sayenge Secundum iudicem populi, sic &amp; ministri eius. &amp;c. that is, Lyke as the hede and soueraygne is replenysshed wyth all sapyence and vertue in guydynge of hys people, admynistrynge to theym lawe wyth due &amp; conuenyent iustyce / so shall the subiectes agayn warde be garnysshed wyth awe and louynge drede / &amp; bere vnto hym nexte god all honoure, trouthe, &amp; allegeaunce.

And in lykewyse / an euyll kynge or ruler shall lose hys people, and the cytyes of hys kyngedome shalbe left desolate and vnhabyted.
                        wherefore thus I make an ende, in stede of a chylde wylfully doynge hys luste and pleasure wythout reason / nowe shall a man be lorde and ruler, yt is replenysshed wyth sapiēce and reason / and shall gouerne the people by skylfull domys, settynge a parte all wylfulnesse and pleasure of hym selfe. So that the worde that I beganne wyth, maye be veryfyed of hym, Ecce quia vir dominabitur in populo. The whyche our lorde graunte / and that he maye prosperously reygne to the pleasure of god and welthe of his realme Amen.

And where by hym he was commytted vnto the rule of Lewys his vncle &amp; duke of Angeou, to the tyme of the ful of .xiiii. yeres / yet after the deth of the father, suche vnkyndenesse begā to spryng betwene the lordes of the realme, that for the comon welthe of the same it was agreed by the more partye, that thys Charles shulde be crowned at Raynes i all hasty spede. The whyche was done in short seasō after / &amp; so contynued nat wythoute dysturbaunce of malyce whych kyndeled betwene hys two vncles, and other inconueniences, by the space of iii. yeres ensuyng. The .iiii. yere of hys reygne / the cytesyns of Parys murmurynge and grudgynge for dyuerse imposycyons &amp; taskes of them, leuyed sodeynly arose in greate multytude, entendynge to haue dystressed some of the kynges housholde seruaūtes, &amp; such as were men of ꝑson. But by medyacyon of one dyscrete parsone named Iohn Marsyle, with assystence of the prouost of the marchauntes, the rumoure was somdele appeased / in so mych that the greate multytude was wythdrawen and retourned to theyr occupacyons. But some euyll dysposed, whyche in suspycyous congregacyon euer vse to exyte and styrre the people vnto robbynge and other vnlefull acres / reassocyate them, &amp; sayde and cryed that they wolde haue the Iewys banysshed the cytye. To whom it was answered that the kynge shuld be enformed of theyr desyre / and that vppon it they shulde haue knowlege of the kynges pleasure, wherupō in a rage they ranne vnto the houses of the Iewes / and entryd them by force, in robbynge and spoylynge them, and bare awaye what they myght cary / in sleynge suche of the Iewes as any resystēce and defence made agayn them / &amp; neuer after restored ye sayd goodes, not wythstandynge that the kyng in that byhalfe gaue sore and strayte cō

It was not longe after that suche as were of ye kynges secrete counsayle, consyderynge the great charges and nedes of ye kyng, and the weykenesse of his treasoure / by authoryte of the kynges cōmyssyons called before them the rulers of Parys, of Roan, and other good cytyes. The whyche beynge assembled, to them was shewed the many and importune charges whyche ye kynge

dayly had for the defēse of hys realm and subiectes. wherfore by all wyse &amp; polytyke meanes that they myghte vse, they exorted the sayde commons to graūte vnto the kynge in waye of subsydye .xii.vi. of the poūde of all wares at that dayes curraūt. To the whyche requeste in conclusyō after aduyse taken of theyr neyghbours / it was answered that the peple were so sore charged in tymes passed, that they myght nat susteyne or bere any more charges, tyll theyr necessytie were otherwyse releuyd / so that in cō
                           clusyō at thys season the kynge and hys coūsayll were dyspoynted.
                        In the .vi. yere of thys Charles / ye Flemynges, whych by a certayne season had rested theym frome batayll / were it for necessyte or synguler couetyze of Lewys theyr duke, he asked of them a greate ayde or taske. And for he knewe well that yf he myghte wynne the fauoure and graūt of the towne of Gaunt, he shulde the soner haue hys pleasure of the resydue / therefore he fyrste began by meanes of fayrenesse. And after whā thereby he sawe he myght take none aduaū
                           tage, he added therunto manasses &amp; thretenynges / the whyche nat wythstandynge the Flemynges bode stedfast in one opynyon, &amp; denayed styfly theyr dukes request. whereuppon he lastly departyng from Gaunt, wyth great displeasure sayd, I shall shewe my selfe to be lorde &amp; soueraygne of thys towne &amp; of the obstynat people of the same. And shortly after ye duke made sharpe warre vpō thē of Gaūt / &amp; they in lykewise defēded them vigurously, so that theyr enemyes wā of them lytle auaūtage. And after thys warre hadde bē a season contynued, nat wythoute losse of many men vppon bothe partyes / the Gaunteners remembrynge the obedyence and fydelyte whyche they shulde bere to theyr souerayne lorde &amp; duke, made meanes that they myghte be harde. After graunte whereof, they sente vnto hym certayne oratours whyche hadde vnto hym the wordes in sentence folowynge. Mooste souerayne nexte god, we deny nat but we accept the for our prynce and leder / &amp; to the as thyne it becommeth vs to obey wyth all reason.
                        And thou agayne arte bounde to defende vs. If we any thyng by our ouersyght &amp; neclygence haue agayn the trespassed / we mekely beseche the of forgyuenesse. And furthermore besechynge the, that suche fraunchyses &amp; lybertyes to vs by thy noble progenytours before graūted, thou wyll nat from vs withdraw nor abrydge / by reason wherof thy people of Gaūt maye nat to any taxe contrary theyr volunte be cōstrayned. But &amp; to thy nede of warres thou haue necessytye of ayde of thy commons, they of free wyll all cōstraynte sette a parte, are redy to ayde and helpe the, as fre &amp; as lyberall as thy trewe subiectes. By reason of whyche wordes ye duke was of hys ire towarde theym some what apeased. But after theyr departyng from the duke or erles presēce / such yonge knyghtes as were of the erles hoste, hadde vnto theym many hygh &amp; dysdaynous wordes / sayeng that they were thrall vnto theyr erle, and that theyr obstynacye shulde be to the vttermoste of theyr reproche &amp; correccyon, and they by coaccion and constraynt forced to do theyr dutye. By occasyō of whyche wordes / the Gaūteners retournyng to theyr former wylfulnesse, kepte styl theyr former opynyō, &amp; defended the erle &amp; his people as they before hadde done. wherfore the erle seynge he myghte nat by strēghte preuayle agayne hys enemyes / studied the wayes &amp; meanes to famysshe theym by hunger / 

so that by that meane he might draw the towne to hys subieccyō. And that to brynge to effecte he gyrde ye towne about wyth a stronge syege. Than the Gaūteners supprysed wyth more obduracion of herte agayne theyr prynce / made them a capytayne named Phylype Artyuele, the sonne of Iakes de Artyuele before slayne of ye Flemynges / lyke as to you I haue before shewed in the .xvii. yere of Philippe de Ualoys late kyng of Fraūce The whyche furnysshynge hys people wyth all habylymentes of warre / made out of the towne &amp; pyghte hys feelde in a playne ioynynge vnto it / where the erles people &amp; they fought a sharpe fyght &amp; longe. But in ye ende fortune was vnto the erle or duke so frowarde that wyth losse of .v.M. of hys soudyours he was forced to take Bruges for hys suertye.
                        By reason of thys vyctory thys Artyuele beynge nat a lytle supprysed wyth pryde / exorted in such wyse the dwellers wythin the towne of Gaunte, and all suche as were nere neyghbours vnto them, to set a parte all occupacyon aswell husbandry as other, &amp; gyue theyr hole study vnto actes and feates of warre. The erle thus beynge wythin ye town of Bruges / a daye of greate solempnytie yerelye holden by them of Bruges approched, whyche they wordshypped in the honoure of our lordes bloode. To thys daye of solemptye vsed yerely to come, all the inhabytauntes of the vyllages &amp; coūtrey there aboute. whyche daye of feast Phylyp de Artiuele callynge to mynde / appoyntyd vnto hī .ii.M of his soudiours / &amp; warned them wyth armoure beynge clad vnder theyr clothes, to ascende by .ii, by thre, by foure, &amp; lyke small companyes vnto thys feestfull solempnyte / &amp; at such tyme as he gaue warnyng, euery man to be redy wyth swerde in hande, to make rome amōge ye prese to the ende that they myght take the erle than of helpe destytute. whyche cautele thus prepared for / at the day comyn of thys sayde feeste, the towne beynge replenysshed with people / the sayde Artyuele vnsuspect of any persone, with hys company in maner abouesayde entred the towne of Bruges. And whā he sawe his best tyme / he sodeynly cryed, asarmis, asarmes. wyth whyche sodeyn crye the erle beynge astonyed / manfully for a whyle wythstode hys enemyes, and encouraged the people agayne them. But for that the Gaunteners were in armoure and the other vnarmed / they of the erles party fled soone. That seynge the erle, wyth great diffyculte fledde / &amp; so lepyng ieopardously into the house of an olde woman, escaped &amp; went vnto Scluse, &amp; there a whyle helde hym.
                        Than thys Artyuele sayeng that by the ayde of theym of Bruges he was dispoynted of the erles takyng / felle vpon the inhabytauntes of the towne, and slewe of theym a certayn / and after wyth greate pompe &amp; pyllage retourned vnto Gaunt.
                        IN the .vii. yere of this Charles / by procuryng of hys vncle Lewys duke of Angeou, a taxe was efte axed of the comons of Fraunce. The whych to bryng to effecte many frendes &amp; promoters were made, aswell of cytezyns as other. But anone as ye commons of Parys vnderstode of this / they became wylde, &amp; assembled in thycke companies / nat regardyng the reasonable allegacions to theym layed and shewed by Petyr Dylet &amp; Iohn̄ Matsyll, though in them they had great affeccion &amp; truste / but toke them to theyr affeccion &amp; mynde, and made amonge them certayn capytaynes &amp; rulers / and kept the watche by

By whose meanes the multytude was pardoned / and a fewe suche as were the begynners were put in execucyon.

But Carongon beynge wyth it nothynge dysmayed / lyght from hys horse, and bare hym so manfully, that he ouercame hys aduersarye, &amp; caused hym to confesse hys offence / for the whych he was streyght drawen vnto the gybet of Parys, and there hāged. And to the sayd Carongon the kyng gaue in rewarde a thousande frākes or a hundreth poūde sterlynge money / &amp; ouer that he gaue vnto hym as an annuall fee or rent two hūdreth frankes, whyche is in value of .xx. poūde sterlynge money.
                        In these dayes as wytnesseth Gagwynus / an anker berynge in hys hande a rede crosse, a man to loke to of goostlye conuersacyon, came vnto the Frēche kynges court. The which by the housholde seruaūtes or famylyers of the court, was lōge kept frō hys presence / all be it that lastelye he was brought vnto hym. To whome he shewed that he was deuynely monysshed, that he shulde charge hym to absteyne from hys customable vse in leuyenge so often taskes &amp; subsydyes / &amp; yt he dyd nat, he shulde well vnderstande, that the wrath of god was nere to hym to punysshe hym, yf he refused hys commaūdement. The whyche message the kynge toke at small regarde. But shortly after the quene was delyuered of a doughter that dyed soone after. wherefore the kynge callynge to mynde the ankers wordes / for fere of other punysshement refrayned a season frome leuyenge of trybutes and taskes.
                        But by the exortacion of hys two vnkylles, he in shorte season after tourned to hys former custome. Kynge Charles thus passynge hys tyme wyth greate murmure of hys commons, &amp; rebellyon of the duke of

Brytayn, wyth many other aduersytyes whych were longe to wryte / lastly in the .xiiii. yere of hys reygne or nere about, he made warre vpon the people of west Fraunce called in late Cenomanni.
                        whan Charles was entred thys countrey, whyche was in the domynyon of the duke of Brytayn / ye duke sent vnto hym messengers, sayenge to hym that he shulde nat nede to inuade hys coūtrey wyth so great strē
                           ghte / for he and his shuld be hooly at hys commaundement. But of thys message ye king toke no regard / for as sayth myne auctour, he was nat most wysest prynce, but was ruled by hys housholde seruauntes, and belyued euery lyght tale that was brought to hym / and ouer that he was so lyberal that it was of wyse men accompted more prodygalyte than lyberalitye. As Charles nat wythstandyng this message of ye duke helde on his iournay / commynge nere vnto a woode, he was sodeynly mette of a man lyke vnto a begger whyche sayde vnto hī whither goest thou syr kyng / beware thou go no farther for thou arte betrayed / and into the handes of thyne enemyes thyne owne meyny shall delyuer the▪ wyth thys monyssion of thys poore mā / the kynge was astonyed, &amp; stoode styl, and begā to muse. In whyche study he so beyng / one of hys folowers whyche after hym bare his spere, sleped vpō his horse backe / &amp; in hys so slepyng let hys spere fall vpon the helmet of hys felowe▪ wyth whych stroke the kyng was sodeynly fered, thynkynge hys enemyes had commen vnwarely vpō hym wherefore he in a gere drewe hys swerde &amp; layed about hym at the geynest, and slewe .iiii. of his knyghtes or he were refrayned / and toke therewyth suche an endelye fere, that he fell therwyth dystraughte.
                        wherefore he was to a place there by broughte, &amp; lay there in poynte of deth a longe season after, in so moch that the fame ranne that he was ded. But by prayers &amp; other greate dedes of charyte done for hym / lastely he recouered and retourned vnto Parys. And for he was nat yet retourned to hys perfyghte helthe / his two vncles than beynge that one duke of Berry, &amp; that other duke of Burgone, toke vpon them by auctoryte of the estates of the lande, to rule the realm for that season / in whyche season diuers officers were altered &amp; chaūged. The kyng thus contynuyng his lykenes / many interludes and games were deuysed for the kynges recreacyon &amp; comforte.
                        And vppō a season he beynge lodged in the quenes lodgynge in the subarbes of saynte Marcell / dyuers noble men of the courte made a dysguysynge, and apparayled theym in lynnen clothes glewed vnto theyr naked bodyes wyth pytche / &amp; florisshed theym wyth dyuerse colours &amp; oyles so that they were couered all excepte the faces / and thus apparayled with torche lyghte entred the Chaumbre where as the kyng was, and there in goodly maner shewed theyr disport / so that the kynge was therewith wel contented.
                        But were it of rechelesnesse or of some 
                              •
                           uyl disposed person / fyre was put to the vestures of the disguysers / the whyche anone was vppon suche a flame, that no man there coulde quenche it. wherfore the sayd disguysers beynge by reason of pytche and oyles greuously turmented, ranne into pyttes and waters whyche they myghte sonest attayne 
                              •
                           nto / and so wyth greate dyffyculte saued theym selfe.
                        In meane tyme whereof, the chaū
                           ber beynge wyth the same tyred,

grewe in so greate a flame, that in shorte whyle the more parte of that lodgynge was consumed / to ye great fere of ye kynge and other astates thā there beynge presente, and augmentynge agayne of his former sykenes / so that certayne appoyntementes to be holdē betwene hym and Rychard kynge of Englande, were for that tyme put of.
                        IN the .xvi. yere of thys Charles / the maryage of peace betwene bothe realmes was concluded and fynysshed at Calays / as before I haue shewed to you in the .xix. yere of kyng Rycharde. And that triumphe fynysshed / Charles at the cōtemplacyon and prayer of the kynge of Hungry, sent vnto hym Phylyp erle of Arroys, wyth dyuers other knyghtes in good noumber, to ayde ye sayd kynge agayne the Turkys. The whyche after that they hadde there a season warred / the capytaynes &amp; the more party of the Frenchemen, of the Turkys were dystressed &amp; slayne / &amp; many taken prisoners to theyr great charge.
                        Thys Charles thus contynuyng hys lykenesse / two freres of saynte Augustynes order beynge desyrous of money, toke vppon theym to cure the kyng. And after they had shauen hys hede and mynistred to hym medicyns / the kynge dayly febled in suche wyse yt he was nye dede. For whiche cōsyderacyon / they examyned by phylosophers and doctours of physyke &amp; founden vncunnynge, were degraded of theyr presthode, &amp; after behedded. To thys folye were these fretes broughte, by the excytynge of the duke of Burgoyne as the common fame went.
                        In the .xix. yere of thys Charles the lande of Fraunce was greuously vexed wyth the plage of ipydymye / of whyche sykenesse a greate multytude of people dyed. And that yere was there also sene a blasynge starre of wonderfull bygnes, wyth stremes apperynge to mēnes syghte of moste feruent brennynge. In thys yere also Charles herynge of ye subduyng of kynge Rycharde, sente into Englande two of hys housholde knyghtes / requyrynge kynge Henry the fourth than newelye made kynge, to sende home hys doughter Isabell latelye maryed vnto kyng Rychard, wyth suche do war as wyth hyr was promysed.
                        In doynge of whyche message kynge Henry toke such dyspleasure, that as sayeth Gagwinus myne auctour, he threwe the sayde twoo knightes in prysone / where through one of theym named Blanchet dyed in Englande, and that other called Henry, after greate sykenesse retourned into Fraunce. And shortely after kynge Henry sente the sayde dame Isabell vnto Calays / where she was ioyously receyued of the Frenchemen, and so conueyed vnto hyr sayde father, whyche as yet was nat of hys sykenesse cured. By reason whereof among the lordes of Fraūce, eueryche of them coueytyng to haue rule, great dyssencion &amp; malyce begā to kendle / and specyallye betwene the dukes of Orleaunce, of Burgoyne, and of Berry. Than the duke of Orleaunce entēdyng to promote hys cause / vnknowyng the other lordes, allyed hym wyth ye duke of Geldre, &amp; strēghthed hym wyth .v.C. men of hys, &amp; so entred the feeldes of Parys. And in lyke maner ye duke of Burgoyne wyth a stronge cōpany kept an other cooste of ye countrey.
                        Natwythstandyng by meanes of other lordes these two dukes were kept a sunder / &amp; at lenghte yt duke of Orleyaunce by the kynges comaundement

that somewhat was than amended, was ordayned regente of the realme. The whiche anone as he was sette in auctoryte / fell to all rauyne, and oppressed the people with cotydyan taskes and tallages / and ye spirituall men with dymes &amp; other exaccyons. wherfore by reason of the studyentes of Parys, he was at lengthe discharged of that dignyte, and the duke of Burgoyne for hym put in auctoryte. Than the duke of Orleyaunce beynge discontented, yode vnto Lucēbourgth a towne in highe Almayne, &amp; sought agayne ayde of the duke of Geldre foresayd. But by his frendes he was so aduertysed, yt with his owne folkes he returned into Fraunce. But yet the malyce and stryfe a twene hym and the duke of Burgoyne seased nat.
                        About this season or soone after, dyed the duke of Brytayne. And as affermeth the auctour afore named / kyng Henry ye .iiii. maryed his wyfe. wherof hering ye duke of Burgoyne, with a company of .vi.M. knyghtes entred Brytayne / &amp; there by strength toke from her, her .iii. sonnes named Iohn̄, Richard, &amp; Arthure / &amp; presented them vnto kynge Charles. In ye xxii. yere of this Charles, was borne of Isabell hys wyfe a man chylde, which also was named Charles / the which after the deth of his father, vnto ye great aduersyte of all the realme of Fraūce, was king of that realme / &amp; contrary the appointment taken a twene Henry the .v. after kynge of Englande, and thys Charles the father nowe of Fraunce kynge / as after shall more appere in the story of the sayde kynge Henry the fyfte.
                        In this yere also was dame Isabell somtyme wyfe of Rycharde latelye kynge of Englande, maryed vnto Charles eldeste sonne of the duke of Orleyaunce. And Iohn̄ the eldyste of the .iii. forenamed sonnes of the duke of Brytayne lately dede / toke to wyfe Margarete ye doughter of kynge Charles. And Phylyppe duke of Burgoyne dyed soone after / leauynge an heyre after hym named Iohn̄. The whyche after he was gyrde with the swerde of the duchye of Burgoyne / he anone by euyll entysynge and counsell, areryd warre agayne the duke of Orleyaunce, to the great dysturbaunce of all the realme. For the sayde duke of Orleyaunce was a prynce of a wonderfull hyghe courage, and desyrous of great honoure / and after the sayenge of Gagwynus coueyted to be kynge of Fraunce. The whyche went to Auyngnyon / where as than sate the .xiii. Benet thā pope duryng the scisme, and admytted by some of the Cardynalles after the dethe of Clement ye .vi. To whiche Benet the said duke made great labour, to depryue the Uniuersite of Parys from ye great auctoryte yt it at those dayes stode in / whiche was of merueylous auctoryte than, as sayeth the forenamed auctour. In thys whyle thus endurynge the lande full of myseryes &amp; aduersites / the quene which yt moche fauoured the dukes partie accompanyed with the sayd duke rode to take her dysporte of huntynge in to the countrey of Meldon. To whiche place she sente letters vnto the Dolphyn by ye duke of Bauary her brother, that he with hys wyfe whiche was doughter vnto the duke of Burgoyne, shulde come for to dysporte theym. whereof Iohn̄ thanne duke of Burgoyne beynge warned / suspected the quene, that she wyth ayde of the duke wolde conueye the Dolphyn into Germanye, and there to holde hym at theyr pleasures. And to e
                              •
                           peche that purpose / he ī all ha

                           e sped him towarde ye Dolphyn / 

and contrary the mynde of the duke of Bauarye whiche than was vpon his waye with the sayd Doulphyne towarde the quene, retourned hym and lodged him in a stronge castell called Lupar. whereof herynge the duke of Orleyaunce / assembled to hym a cōpany of .vi. thousande knyghtes &amp; came agayne towarde Parys, where as that tyme the duke of Burgoyne was. And he herynge of ye dukes cōmyng, made him stronge to receyue hym. To whome the cytezens of Parys were fauourable &amp; aydynge, for the euyll wyll that they before bare vnto the duke of Orleyaunce / &amp; also for they hoped by hym to be defended from taskes and tallages. Thus contynuynge the prouisyon vpon bothe partyes to mete shortely in playne batayle / suche polytike meanes was foūde by a noble man called Mountague, that a concorde and vnyte was for that tyme by hym sette atwene the sayd dukes. And for that newe occasyon shulde nat by presēce kyndle atwene them / therfore ye duke of Orleyaunce with hys company was sent into Guyan, to warre vpon the englysshemen / &amp; that other vnto Calays to lay syege vnto that towne. The which before had prepared a wonderfull engyne sette vpon whelys / by the strength wherof he thoughte to wreke greate dysturbaunce vnto the sayd towne / &amp; as sayth myne auctour Gagwyne, was in great hoope to recouer it agayne to the subieccyon of the house of Fraūce. But that hope was soone dyspayred / for it was nat longe after or the sayd duke by the kynge was countermaunded and returned. And the duke of Orleyaunce, after he knewe that rescous were commyng frō Burdeaux / he remoued his siege layde by hym to Burgus a towne of Guyan / &amp; so returned into Fraunce, to his cōfusyon as after shall appere.
                        IN the .xxvii. yere of this Charles / the former malyce and enuye contynuyng in the brestes of the sayd dukes of Orleyaunce and of Burgoyne / as the sayd duke of Orleyaunce was goynge towarde hys lodgynge in the nyght of the .x. daye of Decembre, fell vpon him certayne knyghtes, of the whiche one named Rafe Auctouyle was leder / &amp; slewe hym nere vnto a gate of the cytie of Parys named Barbet gate.
                        After whyche murder fynysshed / ye sayde sir Rafe with hys adherentes fledde vnto the place of the erle of Artoys, where the duke of Burgoyne vsed accustomably to resorte. And ye dede corps was soone after by suche as came to ye exclamacyō, with also a seruaūt of his with him slaine / borne into ye next houses. whan the rumour of this murder was blowen about ye cytie / anone Lewys vncle vnto the kynge and than kynge of Scecyle, the dukes of Berry and of Burbon with other, drewe thyder / and there with lamentacyon beholdynge the corps, commaunded prouisyon to be made for the buryenge of it within the monastery of Celestynes / where vpon the seconde day folowynge, he was buryed wyth great pompe. whome amōge other lordes folowed to his buryenge the duke of Burgoyne, nat without great suspicyon of the sayd murder. And that enterrement with due obseruaunce fynysshed / auctoryte was gyuen vnto .ii. knyghtes named Roberte Tuyller &amp; Peter Orpheuer, to make enquery for the murder of this prince. wherof the duke of Burgoyne beynge ascertayned, voyded the cytie, &amp; brake the brydge of saynte Maxence after hym, that pursute after hym shulde nat be made / and so hastely spedde

hym, that that nyght folowynge he came to Andwarpe, whiche is vpon an .C. myle from Parys. whan Charles the kyng harde of the escape of ye sayd duke / feryng leste he wolde accuse hym to be consentyng vnto that euyll dede, sent vnto hym comfortable messages / so that the sayde duke without warre restyd all that wynter, sometyme in Arthoys, and an other whyle in Flaunders at his pleasure. In the whiche pastyme he sente into dyuers places of Fraunce sondry accusacyons of the duke before slayne, that he entēded to depose the kyng, and to take vpon hym the rule &amp; gouernaunce of the realme, and to haue poysoned the sayd kyng, as by dyuers tokens by hym affermed for perfourmaūce of the same. And also that the said duke of Orleyaūce was cause of fyrynge of ye disguysers garmentes before shewed, to the ende to brynge the kyng in more daunger of syckenes, or els to be consumed with the same fyre / with sondry other distamacyons, as leuyenge of taskes and imposicyons of the people, to his singuler auauntage and hougely enrychynge, wherby he myghte the soner attayn vnto his said purpose. Thus contynuyng this great vnkyndenes atwene the duke of Burgoyne, and the sonne and other of his blode of ye duke of Orleyaunce / the said duke agayne the begynnynge of the yere, herynge that the king and the quene were departed from Parys to Charters, assēbled to hym a strōge power of Holāders &amp; other, and came vnto Parys, in which cytie he moch trusted / to the ende to cause the kynge, ye quene, and the Doulphyn, to whome he hadde maryed hys doughter, for to retourne vnto Parys. And to strengthe hys partye, he broughte with hym wyllyam erle of Hanster / which wyllyam was a man of great strengthe and allyaunce, and hadde maryed hys syster vnto the duke of Burgoyne foresayde / and hys doughter and heyre vnto one of kyng Charles sonnes / and was gossyppe vnto the quene. For whyche sayde, consyderacyons, the sayde erle entendynge the weale of that realme of Fraunce, laboured suche wayes and meanes, that by hym for that tyme a concorde and vnytie was dryuen and made atwene the two dukes of Orleyaunce and Burgoyne, wyth assured othes and necessary actes to that concorde belongynge / and the king with his retynewe was agayne retourned vnto Parys. These dukes thus appeased, and the duke of Burgoyne agayne restored to the gouernaunce of the realme / assocyate vnto hym the kynge of Nauerne, whyche varyed nat from his fathers vnstable condycyons / so that by him newe occasyons of stry

                           e and varyaunce were moued atwene the sayde dukes and theyr allyes. For fyrste they soughte occasyon agayne the forenamed Mountague, a man of great wysedome and honoure in the kynges courte, and especyall frende vnto the duke of Orleyaunce / and by theyr malyce and vntrewe surmyses fynally putte to dethe. And one named Peter Essayer or Sayer thā prouoste of the cytie of Parys or gouernoure, they admytted to the rule of the kynges treasoury / and other dyuers offyces suche as were any thynge fauoured of the duke of Orleaūce, they clerely dyscharged. The whyche for theyr relefe and comfort resorted vnto the sayde duke, shewynge to him all ye demeanure of their aduersaryes / addynge thervnto, ye all suche conuencyons concernynge the amyte atwene hym and the duke of Burgoyne before sworne &amp; enacted, were clerely adnulled &amp; broken.

with these tydynges the duke beyng fyred with newe malyce, accompanyed to hym the dukes of Berry, of Burbon, and of Alenson, the erles of Rychemounte, of Alyberte, and of Armenake, with other nobles nat a fewe / by whose counsels he determyned to be auenged vpon the duke of Burgoyne &amp; other his fautours. wherof the sayde duke beynge monisshed, drewe him towarde Parys, and strengthed the fortresses as he yode. To thys duke of Burgoyne was brother the duke of Brabande named Anthony, a man of great polycye and wysedome / the whych forecastynge the great shedynge of chrysten mannes blode, with many other inconuenyences lykely to haue ensued of this varyaunce atwene these two dukes, made suche affectuous labour, that with great diffyculte he pacifyed them agayne for that tyme / and brought them to personall communicacyon, and lastely to amyable and frendely departynge. After whiche concorde and amyte thus agayn concluded / the duke of Burgoyne departed into Pycardy, leauynge behynde him the fore named Peter Essayr to rule the cytie of Parys. The whiche shortely after drewe to hym suche persones, as before tyme had vexed and distourbed ye duke of Orleyaunce frendes &amp; seruauntes with in that cytie. By whose meanes the sayd Peter sought fyrste occasyon agayne a knight named Uenyt Thorney / and by false suggestyon smote fyrste of his hede, and after dyd hys body to be hanged vpon the cōmon gybet of Parys, in dyspyte of ye sayd duke as testifyeth myne Auctoure. wherwith ye duke beynge wondersly amoued / resembled his knyghtes, &amp; spedde hym towarde a towne named
                        And for to strengthe another towne named, he sente a certayne nombre of his knyghtes / chargyng them with the dwellers to withstande the force of his enemies. Of this hearynge the duke of Burgoyne / anone gathered vnto him the noumbre of .xvi.M. flemynges and Pycardes / and sped hym vnto the sayde towne of And so with his instrumentes of warre assayled the gate of the sayde towne, whyche leadeth towarde saynt Quintyne, yt in shorte space the sayde Flemynges wan the entre of the towne. In whyche meane season the dwellers wyth the other soudyours by a backe way or water, wherof the maner by thys auctoure is nat expressyd / lefte the towne, &amp; yode vnto the duke of Orleyaunce beynge as yet at the foresayde towne of whan the Flemynges were entered the towne, &amp; foūde it deserte of people and pillage / were it for that they lacked theyr praye, or for other cause here nat shewed / they toke suche vnkyndenes agayne the duke, that for prayer nor yet for manasses they wolde nat with hym any lenger tary / but returned them home in all hastely spede towarde theyr owne countrey. So that the duke was fayne to withdrawe / and for the more suretie, to aske ayde and helpe of Englysshemen / and so was holpen by the prynces comforte Henrye sonne of Henry the .iiii, as after shall be touched in the .xii. yere of the .iiii. Henry.
                        IN the .xxxi. yere of thys kynge Charles, whiche was the .xii. yere of the .iiii. Henry than kynge of Englande / the duke of Orleyaunce seynge his enemye was turned from Parys, caused suche Brydges as before by his said enemye were broken to be reedyfyed. By the whyche he passed the ryuer tyll he came to saint Denys / where as than he fande a capytayne

a noble man named syr Iohn̄ Cabylon of the dukes of Burgoyne, there lefte by hym to strength the towne. The whiche syr Iohn̄, cō
                           sideryng ye wekenes of ye said towne. with also his lacke of strēgth / yelded him &amp; the towne vnto the duke / swerynge to him by solempne othe, that after ye daye he shulde neuer bere armes agayne hym. In this pastyme an other capytayne of the Burgonyons called Gancourt, secretely by night wan vpon the frenche men the brydge of saynte Clodalde. But nat longe after the duke of Orleaunce sent thyther certayne Brytons / the whiche agayne recouered the sayde brydge, &amp; helde it vnto ye sayd dukes vse. In whyche tyme and season the duke of Burgoyne recouerynge hys strength, passed the brydge of Melent, &amp; so came vnto the cytie of Parys / and the daye folowynge wyth helpe of the cytesyns recouered the abouesayd brydge of saynt Clodald, and dystressed vpon a .M. Brytons, whyche had the warde of the same. Then the duke of Orleaunce made out of saynte Denys ouer Sayne brydge towarde Parys. wherof that other duke beynge warned, refused the cytye / and with the kynge than there beynge present, remouyd wyth the Dolphyne to the towne called Stamps / and sent ye erle of Marche named Iamys, wyth a certeyne knyghtes to a towne named to strength it ageyne the duke of Orleaunce. The whyche of the sayde dukes knyghtes was encountred with and taken, and so sent to pryson. wherof herynge the duke of Burgoyne, in shorte processe after retourned vnto Parys wyth the kyng and dolphyne / and the duke of Orleaūce yode to a towne called Seyntclowe.
                        And in the .xxxii. yere of thys sayd kynge Charles, by counceyll of the duke of Berry and other, seyng that the sayde cytye of Parys was so let agayne hym wyth also the kynge &amp; the dolphine, sent a noble man of his hoste named Alberte vnto Henry the iiii yet kynge of Englande, to requyre hym of ayde to withstande the tyrannye of the duke of Burgoyne, that wyth hys complyces entendyd to subuerte the realme of Fraunce. To this requeste kynge Henry gaue good eare, and lastely graunted to hys petycyon / &amp; sent thyder as sayth the Frenche cronycle, Thomas hys sonne duke of Clarence / also ye duke of yorke, wyth Iohn̄ erle of Cornewayle, accompanyed wyth .viii.C. knyghtes and sowdyours, &amp; a thousande archers. The whych company, when they were landed in Fraunce, &amp; herde yt the French lordes were in treaty of peace, &amp; no man to thē gaue wages as they tofore were ꝓmysed / fell vpon a towne called and it ryffled / &amp; therin toke as prysoners the abbot of that monastery wyth other, and cōueyed thē to Burdeaux, and after into Englande / where for theyr fynaunce &amp; other money due of olde by the Frenche kynge, as affermeth Gagwyne, they remayned many yeres after. And that the Englysh men were thus departed, albeit that in the Englysshe cronycle and .xiii. yere of the forenamed kynge Henry, of them is other report made / the lordes of Fraunce retourned to theyr olde discēcyon &amp; contynued in longe stryfe / wherof the cyrcūstaunce were longe and tedyouse to tell, &amp; to shewe the vnstablynesse of them, how some whyle the duke of Orleaunce was fauoured of the kynge and the dolphyne, and there agayne the duke of Burgoyne cleyne out of conceyte. The which cōtencyō thus enduryng kyng Henry ye iiii. dyed / and Henry his son ye .v. Henry, was admitted for

kyng of Englande after hym / that shortly after sent his ambassadours vnto the Frenche kynge, arynge of him his doughter Katheryne in maryage as affirmeth the frenche boke. But dyuers other wryters shewe, yt he asked the hoole landes due to him within the realme of Fraūce, by reason of the composicion made in tyme passed, atwene his progenytour Edwarde the thyrde, &amp; Iohn̄ than king of Fraunce. And for he was dysdeynously answered / he therfore made vpō them sharpe warre, as in the .iii. yere of ye sayd Hēry after some deale dothe appere. By reason of whyche warre, the cyuyle batayle or stryfe ye longe whyle had cōtynued amonge the frenche men, than dyd aswage. For in the .iii. yere of this Henry, whiche was the .xxxv. yere of this Charles / the said Henry inuaded ye realme of Fraunce, &amp; had at Egyncourte a tryumphant victory / as in the sayde thyrde yere of Hēry the .v. is more at lengthe declared. Than it foloweth in the story, after many townes and stronge holdes by the englysshe men in sondry places of Fraūce opteined / in ye .xxx. &amp; .viii. yere of this Charles, a frenche man named ye lorde of the Ile of Adam &amp; Iohn̄ Uyllers in proper name, gatheryng to hym a company of tyrauntes to the nombre of .CCC. or mo / wherof many were old seruaūtes of the kynges housholde, &amp; than put out by ye Dolphyn &amp; other that than had the rule of the kynge / by treason of a clerke opteyned the keyes of one of the Gates of Parys, and so entred the cytie by nyght / &amp; by a watche worde amonge them deuysed, assocyate to them many Burgonyons / and so beynge stronge, yode where the kyng was, and gate ye rule of his ꝑsone. And that done, all suche as they myght fynde that than bare any rule, they slewe by one meane &amp; other / so that vpon ye day folowyng, was nombred of dede corfes wythin the cytie vpon .iiii.M. Amonge the whiche, of noble men was Henry de Marle than Chaunceller of Fraūce, &amp; Graun
                              •
                           pre with many other. And for to haue the more assystence of the cōmon people / the sayd Uyllers set ye kyng vpon an horse, and ladde hym about the cytie, as he that had small reason to guyde hym selfe / &amp; so ruled all thyng as he &amp; his cōpany wolde. wherfore the Dolphyn feryng to fall in the daunger of so wylde a cōpany, yode to Meldune or / and there called to hym suche as then were lefte on lyne to withstāde these tyrauntes, and ye duke of Burgoyne than beynge within the cytie, &amp; compasser of all thys myschefe as some construed and demed. After whyche company to hym gathered he returned to the cytie of Parys, and assayled one of the gates. But whanne he sawe ye cytezens toke partye agayne hym, he thoughte his trauayle loste. wherfore without great assaute makyng, he called thence his knightes, and so departed agayne to the place whiche he came fro / and from thens vnto Thuron, in appeasynge the countreys &amp; townes as he went, whiche at those dayes were farre out of frame. And than in the .xxxix. yere of the sayd Charles / king Henry the .v. landed with a strōge power at a place called Touke in Normandy / and after layde syege to manye stronge holdes and townes &amp; them wanne, as Cane, Phaleys, Roan, and other / as in the .vi. yere of the sayd Henrye folowynge is more at lengthe declared. In tyme of whyche warre thus made by kynge Henry / the Dolphyn and the duke of Burgoyne, eyther of them prouyded to defende the malyce of the other / in so moche that as testyfyeth the frenche cronycle,

the duke was aduysed to haue taken partie with the Englisshemen. This sayeng as wytnesseth an auctour named Floure of hystoryes, which toucheth in laten many gestes &amp; dedes done by kynges of Englāde / sayeth that the Frenche men bryng in that, for to excuse theyr infortune &amp; cowerdyse / by reason whereof they loste nat all onely theyr lande, but also the honoure &amp; name of the same. Than lastely the duke beynge of mynde by exortacyon of Phylyppe Iosquyne and Iohn̄ de Tolongn̄, with also a lady called the countesse of Grat / the duke was reconsyled vnto the Dolphyne / and a day of metynge apoynted at Monstruell, where eyther of them shulde be accōpanyed with .x. lordes onely without mo. At whyche day the sayd prynces with theyr assygned lordes beynge assembled / many reasons and argumētes were layde and replyed vpon bothe sydes. By occasyon wherof one of the Dolphyns company sodainly drewe hys knyfe and strake the duke vnto the harte, so that he dyed soone after. whyche murder was supposed to be done by a knyght called Tanguyde de Chastell / whyche oftyme passed had ben famylyer seruaunt with the duke of Orleyaūce before slayne, by meanes of the sayde duke of Burgoyne.
                        After whiche murder thus commytted / the lande of Fraunce was broughte in moche more stryfe &amp; varyaunce / in so moche that Phylyppe the sonne of the sayde Iohn̄ duke of Burgoyne beynge than in Parys, &amp; hauynge the rule of ye kynge and the cytie, toke partie with the Englysshe men agayne ye Dolphyn. By reason wherof as sondry wryters agre, king Henryes ꝑtie was greatly augmented &amp; holpen / so that fynally kynge Henry opteyned moche of his wyll / &amp; shortly after maryed dame Katheryne doughter of Charles kynge in the .xli. yere of his reygne, with assuraunce &amp; promyse of the inherytaūce of the realme of Fraunce to him and his heyres after the dethe of the said Charles / as to you more plainly shal be shewed in the .viii. yere of the said Henry the fyfte. After whyche maryage concluded and fynysshed / yet ye Dolphyn ceased nat to make newe mocyons &amp; sterynges. Durynge the whiche, kynge Charles dyed in Octobre / and was buryed at saynt Denys, whan he had reygned in greate trouble vpō the poynt of .xlii. yeres / leauyng after hym as is affirmed by the forenamed auctour Gaguyne, a sonne &amp; Dolphyn of Uyenne called Charles, whiche after was kyng of Frenchemen, and was named Charlys the .vii. or the .viii. after some wryters.
                     
                     
                        Henry the .iiii. Anglia.
                        
                           HEnry the .iiii. of that name, and sonne of Iohn̄ of Gaunte late duke of Lācaster / toke possessyon of the domynion of ye realme of Englande as before in the ende of the story of the seconde Rycharde is shewed, vpon the laste daye of Septembre in the yere of our lorde a .M.CCC.lxxxxix / and in the .xix. yere of Charles ye .vii. than kyng of Fraūce. After whyche possessyon so by hym taken, anone he made newe officers. As the erle of Northumberlande he made Constable of Englande, the erle of westmerlāde was made Marshall, syr Iohn̄ Serle Chaunceller, Iohn̄ Newebery esquyer tresorer, and syr Rycharde Clyfforde knyght

keper of ye priuey signet. And yt done, prouysyon was made for hys coronacyon agayne the day of translacyō of saynt Edwarde the confessour nexte than commyng. And the parlyament was prolonged tyll the tuysdaye folowynge the sayd daye of coronacyō. Than vpō the euyn of the sayd daye of coronacyon, the kynge wythin the towre of Londō made .xli. knyghtes of the bate wherof .iii. were hys owne sonnes,Coronaciō of Henry ye fourth. &amp; .iii. erles, &amp; .v. lordes.

                           torbury. After whych solempnyte fynysshed an honorable feest was holden wythin the greate halle of westmynster. where the kyng beyng set in the mydde see of the table / the archebisshop of Caūtorbury with .iii. other prelates were set at the same table vppon the ryght hāde of the kyng / &amp; the archebysshoppe of yorke wyth other iiii. prelates was set vpō that other hāde of the kyng / &amp; Hēry the kynges eldest sonne stoode vppō the ryghte hande wyth a poyntlesse swerde holdyng vp ryght / &amp; the erle of Northhumberlāde newely made constable, stode vpō the left hāde wyth a sharpe swerd holdē vp ryght. And by eyther of those swerdes, stode .ii. other lordes holding .ii. scepters. And before ye kyng stode all the dynerwhyle the dukes of Amnarle of Surrey &amp; of Exceter, wyth other .ii. lordes. And ye erle of westmerlāde thā newly made Marshal, rode about the halle with many typped staues aboute hym, to se the roume of ye halle kepte, that offycers myghte wyth ease serue the tables. Of the whych tables the chyefe vpō the ryghte syde of the halle was begunne wyth the Barons of the fyue portes, &amp; at the table nexte the cupborde vppō the lefte hande, sate the mayre and hys bretherne the aldemē of Londō. whych mayre than beynge Drewe Barentyne goldsmyth, for seruice there by hym that daye done, as other mayres at euery kynges &amp; quenes coronacion vse for to do / had there a stādyng cuppe of golde. Thā after the seconde course was serued / syr Thomas Dymmoke knyght beynge armed at all peaces, &amp; syttynge vpō a good stede, rode to the hygher parte of the halle / &amp; there before the kynge caused an herowde to make proclamacyon, that what mā wolde saye that kynge Hēry was nat ryght full enherytoure of the crowne of England, &amp; ryghtfully crowned / he was there redy to wage wyth hym batayl than, or suche tyme as it shuld please the kynge to assygne. whyche proclamacyon he caused to be made after in iii. sundry places of the halle in Englyshe &amp; in Frenche, wyth many mo obseruaunces at hys solemnyte exercysed &amp; done, whyche were longe to reherse.
                        Than thys feest wyth all honour ended / vpon the morne beyng tuysday, the parliamēt was agayne begunne. And vpon wednysdaye syr Iohanne Cheyny that before that tyme had occupyed as speker of that parlyamēt, by hys owne labour for cause of such infyrmytyes as he than hadde, was dyscharged / and a squyer named wyllyam Durwarde was electe to that roume for hym.
                        And thanne was the parlyament and the actes thereof laste called by kynge Rycharde adnulled, and sette at noughte / and the parlyamente holden in the .xi. yere of hys reygne holden for ferme and stable. And the same daye Henry the kynges eldeste sonne was chosen &amp; admytted prynce of walys, and duke of Cornewalle, and erle of Chester, and heyre apparaunte to the crowne. Uppon

the thursdaye folowynge was putte into the comon house a byll, deuysed by syr Iohn̄ Bagot than prysonere in the Towre. whereof the effecte was, that the said sir Iohn̄ confessed that he harde kynge Rycharde saye dyuers tymes and at sondry parlyamentes in hys tyme holden, that he wolde haue hys entente and pleasure concernynge hys owne maters, what so euer betyde of the resydue. And yf any withstode hys wyll or mynde / he wolde by one meane or other brynge hym out of lyfe.
                        Also he shewed farther, that king Rycharde shulde shewe and saye to hym at Lychefelde, in the .xxi. yere of hys reygne, that he desyred no lenger to lyue, than to see hys lordes &amp; commons to haue hym in as great awe and drede, as euer they had of any of hys progenytours / so that it myghte be cronycled of hym, yt none passed hym of honour and dygnite / with condycyon that he were deposed and put from his sayde dygnytie the morowe after. And yf euer it came so to, that he shulde resygne hys kyngelye magestye / he sayde his mynde was to resygne to the duke of Herforde, as to hym that was moste ableste to occupye that honoure. But one thynge he feared, leste he wolde do tyrannye agayne the churche. More ouer he shewed by ye said byll, that as the sayde syr Iohn̄ Bagot rode behynde the duke of Norfolke towarde westmynster / the sayd duke layed to hys charge, that he with other of ye kynges counsell had murdred ye duke of Glocetyr / y• which at ye tyme to the said duke he denyed, &amp; sayd at ye day he was on lyue. But within .iii. wekes after, the sayde syr Iohn̄ by ye kynges cōmaundemente was sent with other ꝑsones vnto Calays / where for fere of his owne lyfe, he sawe ye said murdre put in execucion. And farthermore he shewed, yt there was no man of honour at that dayes more in fauour with king Rycharde, thā was ye duke of Amnarle / &amp; that by his coūsell he toke ye lordes, &amp; wrought many other thinges after ye said dukes aduyce. Also he shewed, yt he harde the kynge beynge than at Chyltrynlangley swere many great othes, yt the duke of Herforde nowe kyng, shulde neuer returne into Englande / and rather than he shulde agayne enheryte hys fathers landes, he wolde gyue them vnto the heyres of the duke of Glocetyr, and of the erles of Arundell, and of warwyke, at the laste parliament adiuged. And farther he shewed, that of all these matters he sent the said duke knowlege into Fraunce, by one named Roger Smerte / admonastynge hym to prouyde by his wysedome to wythstande the kynges malyce, whyche shewed hym to be hys mortall enemye. And lastelye he shewed in the sayde byll, that he harde the duke of Amnarle say vnto sir Iohn̄ Busshey and to syr Henry Grene / I had leuer than .x

And whan they had axed of him whyche man / he said the duke of Herforde / nat for drede that I haue of hys persone, but for sorowe and rumours that he is lykely to make within this realme. whiche bylt was than borne vnto the kynges parlyamente chaumbre, &amp; there 
                              •
                           adde. After redynge whereof / the sayd duke of Amnarle stode vp, and sayd as touchynge suche artycles as in that byll were putte agayne hym, they were false and vntrewe, &amp; that he wolde proue vpon hys body or otherwyse as the kynge wolde commaunde hym. Upon fryday the said syr Iohn̄ Bagot was brought into the sayd parlyament Chambre, and examyned vpon euery artycle of his

byll all the whych he there affermed Than it was axed of hym what he coulde saye ye duke of Exceter. where unto he answered and sayed, that he coulde laye nothyng to hys charge. But there is he sayd a yomā in Newgate called Halle, yt can say somwhat of you. Than sayd the duke, what so euer he or ye can or lyste to say of me / thys is trouthe that I shall here expresse. Trouth it is that the last tyme that the kyng was at woodstoke, the duke of Northfolke &amp; ye haue hadde me to you into the chapel, and closed the dore vpon vs. And there ye made me to swere vpō the sacrament there present, to kepe suche counsayll as there ye shuld than shewe vnto me. where after ye shewed to me, that ye coulde neuer brynge your purpose about, whyle syr Iohn̄ of Gaunt late duke of Lācastre lyued. wherfore ye were aduysed for to haue shortely after a coūsayll at Lychefelde / by the whyche ye cōdiscended yt the sayd syr Iohn̄ shuld be arested, in such maner that he shuld haue occasyō to disobey yt areste / by reason wherof by chaūce medley he shuld be there slayn. wherunto my coūsayl thā was, yt the kyng shulde calle hys secrete coūsayll / &amp; yf they agreed thereunto, I for my part wolde agree vnto ye same. To which sayeng syr Iohn̄ Bagot gaue none answere. And vpō saterday, the sayd Bagot &amp; Halle were bothe broughte into the parlyament chaūbre, &amp; there examined / and after coūtrymaunded to prysone. And as soone as they were departed / the lorde Fitz water stoode vp and sayde. Moste redoughted souerayne lorde, where as ye duke of Amnarle hath before tymes and nowe lately, excused hym of the deth of the duke of Glouceter / I saye and wyll iustyfye it, that he was cause of hys deth and that I shall proue vpō hys body yf your grace be so contented. To the cōtrary whereof the duke wyth sharpe wordes answered / so that gaugys of batayll were offered of bothe partyes, and sealed and delyuered vnto the lorde Marshall. Than partyes beganne to be taken amonge the lordes / in so moche that the duke of Surrey toke party
                              •
                            with the duke of Amnarle / and sayde that all that by hym was done, was done by constraynte of Rycharde thanne kynge / and he hym selfe and other consented parforce to the same. where agayne the sayde lorde Fytz water and other replyed. wherfore sylence was commaūded / and forthwyth the fore named Halle for that he hadde confessed before the lordes, that he was one of theym that putte to deth the duke of Gloucetyr at Calays / he therefore was iuged to be drawen frome the towre of London vnto tybourne / and there to be hanged and quartered.
                        The whyche execucion was done vppon the mondaye folowynge. Thus wyth these causes and many other thys parlyamente contynued, tyll a newe mayre named Thomas Knolles grocer was admytted and sworne, vppon the daye folowynge the feaste of Symonde and Iude.

                     And Gaguynus sayeth in hys Frenche cronycle, that kynge Henry sente hys oratours vnto Charles the vii. thanne kynge of Fraunce, for to haue dame Katheryne hys doughter in mariage / with other requestes touchynge hys ryght and enherytaunce. whereunto it was answered by the counsayll of Fraunce, that the kyng hadde no leyser to entende suche idelnesse. wherupon kynge Henry made quycke prouision for to warre vpon the Frenche kynge, as after appereth.

                     And many notable actes for the wele of ye church there were enacted.

                           panyed, rode thorugh London vpon the .xviii. daye of Iuny, towarde the porte of Southamton̄ / where he had appoynted hys hoste to mete wyth hym. And whyle the kyng there was shyppynge of hys people / dyuers of hys lordes, that is to say syr Richard erle of Cambrydge and brother vnto ye duke of yorke / whyche syr Rychard beryng the name of Langley, hadde wedded dame Anne the doughter of syr Roger Mortymer erle of March and wolster / by whome he had yssue Isabell, whyche after was maryed vnto the lorde Boucher erle of Essex, &amp; Rycharde whyche after was duke of yorke &amp; father to kynge Edward ye iiii. To whome also wasassētyng syr Rycharde Scrop than treasourer of

Englande, and syr Thomas Graye knyght, were there arrestyd for treason, and areygned, and so examyned vppon the same, that the .xxix. day of Iuly folowynge they were all thre behedyd. After whyche execucyon so done / the kynge vpon the morowe or shortely after, wyth hys lordes toke shyppynge there, &amp; landed at a place called Kydcaus in Normandy. And the .xvi. daye of Auguste / he sayde syege vnto the towne of Harflew, &amp; assayled them by land and by water / and contynued so hys syege vnto the xxii. daye of September. At whyche daye as sayth the French Gaguinꝰ, it was delyuered by Albert thā there capytayne / vppon condycyon that kynge Henry myghte sauely wynne or passe to Calayes, and so he beyng there, the towne to be yolden vnto hym. But the Frenche wryter Gaguinus vpholdeth the honour of the Frenchemen in all that he maye / and boroweth of hys conscyence for sparynge the trouth in reporte of many thynges. For after moste wryters, ye sayde towne after sondry appoyntementes of rescouse / was delyuered vnto the kynge wythout any condycyon the daye aboue. sayde. where after the kynge had ordeyned syr Thomas Beauforde hys vncle and erle of Dorser capytayne of that towne / he spedde hym towarde Calays.
                        Than the dolphyn with other lordes of Fraunce, whyche at that tyme hadde the realme of Fraunce in gouernaunce, for so moche as the Frenche kynge was vysyted wyth suche malady as before I haue shewed / brake the brydge to let ye kynge of his passage ouer ye water of Sum. wherfore he was cōstrayned to draw towarde Pycardy / &amp; so passe by ye ryuer of Peron̄. wherfore the Frēchmē beynge ware / assembled and lodged thē at certayne townes named Agyncourt, Rolandcourt, and Blangy, wyth all the power of Fraunce.
                        And whan kyng Henry sawe that he was so besette wyth hys enemies / he in the name of god &amp; saynt George pyght hys felde in a playne betwene the sayd townes of Agyncourte and Blāgy / hauyng in hys companye of hoole men that myght fyght, nat passyng the nombre of .vii.M. But at those dayes the yomen hadde theyr Lymmes at lybertye / for theyr hosyn were than fastened wyth one poynt / and theyr iackes were lōge &amp; easy to shote in, so that they myghte drawe bowes of great strength, &amp; shote arowes of a yerde longe, besyde the hedde.
                        Than the kyng consyderynge the great nombre of hys enemyes, &amp; that the acte of Frenchmē standeth moch in ouer rydyng of theyr aduersaryes by force of speremē / he therfore charged euery boweman to ordeyne hym a sharpe stake, &amp; to pytche it a slope before hym / and whā ye sperys came, somdeale to drawe bak, &amp; so to shote at the horsemen. And at the proper requeste of the duke of yorke, he ordeyned hym to haue ye vawewarde of ye felde. And whā kyng Hēry had thus prouydently ordered for hys batayll ouer night / vpon the morowe beyng the .xxv. daye of Octobre, and ye daye of the holy martyrs Cryspyne &amp; Cryspinian / the kyng caused dyuers masses to be songen. And where that nyghte before, the Englysshe hoste was occupyed in prayer and confessyon / he thanne caused the bysshoppes and other spyrytuall men, to gyue vnto theym generall absolucyon.
                        And that done / wyth a comfortable chere ordered hys people as they shuld fyght, hauyng vnto thē good &amp; comfortable wordes / &amp; so abode ye commynge of theyr enemyes, whych

of dyuers wryters were and are remembred to be about .xl. thousande fyghtynge men.
                        The whyche aboute .ix. of ye cloke in the mornynge, wyth greate pryde set vppon the Englysshe hoste / thynkynge to haue ouer ryden them shortely. But the archers, lyke as before they were taught pyght theyr sharpe stakes before them. And whan they sawe the French galantes approche, they a lytell yode backe &amp; receyued them as here after ensueth.
                     
                     
                        The batayll of Agyncourt.
                        THat is to meane, they shotte at theym so feruently, yt what wyth the shotte, and goryng of theyr horses wyth the sharpe stakes, they tumbeled one vpon an other / so that he or they which ranne formest, were the confusyon of hym or them that folowed / so yt in a shorte whyle a great multytude of horse &amp; men were layd vpon the grounde. And after theyr shotte spent / they layde aboute them with theyr glaynes and axes, that by the greate grace of god and comfortable ayde of the kynge, the vyctory fell that daye to the Englysshemen / and with lytell losse of theyr cōpany. For after the opynyon of sondry wryters / were slayne yt daye of Englishemen, the dukes of yorke and of Suffolke / &amp; not ouer .xxvi. parsons moo. But of Frenchmen were slayne that daye after Englysshe wryters, ouer the nomber of .x. thousande. Albeit ye French Gaguinus sayth, that of the Englyshe hoste were slayne the duke of yorke, and with hym .iiii. hundreth men / and of the French hoste .iiii.M. men of name besyde other / whiche he numbreth not.
                        Also he affermeth to be horsmen at that felde vppon the Frenche partye .x. thousande ouer and besyde the fotemen / and that the Englyshemen were nombred at .xv.C. spere men, &amp; xviii.M. of yomen and archers.
                        At thys sayde batayle was taken prysoners, the duke of Orleaūce, the duke of Burbon̄, ye erle of Uēdosme, of Ewe, of Rychemount, and Bursigaunt thanne marshall of Fraunce / wyth many other knyghtes &amp; esquyres, whych were tedyous to name, to the nōber of .xxiiii. hūdreth &amp; aboue, as wytnesseth the boke of mayres.
                        And in thys batayle were slayne of the nobles of Fraunce, the dukes of Barre, of Alanson, and of Brabā, viii. erles, and barons aboue .lxxx. wyth other gentylmen in cote armours to the nomber of .iii. thousāde and aboue. By reason of whyche pyllage the Englysshemen were greatly auaunced. For the Frenchmen were so assuryd of vyctory by reason of theyr great nōber, that they brought the more plenty of rychesse wyth thē, to the ende to bye prysoners eyther of other / and also after the victory by them opteyned, to shewe vnto Englysshemen theyr pryde &amp; pompous araye. But god whyche knewe the presumpcion and pompe tourned all thynge contrary to theyr myndes &amp; ententes.
                        whan the kynge by grace and power of god, more thā by force of man hadde thus gotten this tryumphaūt vyctorye, and retourned hys people frome the chase of theyr enemyes: tydynges were brought vnto hym, that a newe, hoste of Frēchmen were comynge towarde hym. wherfore he anone commaunded his people to be enbatayled / and that done made proclamacions thorough the hoste, that euery man shulde slee hys prysoner. By reason of whych proclamacyon, the duke of Orleaunce and the other lordes of Fraunce were in such fere, that they anone by lycence of ye kyng

sent such worde vnto the sayd hoste, that they wythdrewe them. And the kynge wyth hys prysoners vpon the morow folowyng toke hys waye toward his towne of Caleys / where he rested hī duryng this mayres tyme.

                     THys yere and .xxix. daye of Nouember, as the mayre rode towarde westmynster for to take hys charge / a pursyuaūt of ye kynges came wyth letters vnto the mayre, gyuyng to hym knowlege of the kynges good spede. wherfore the byshop of wynchester than chaūceller of England hauynge lyke wyttynge, came that daye to Poulys, and there caused Te deum to be songē wyth great solempnyte. And in lyke wyse was lyke obseruaunce done in ye parysshe chyrches and other relygyous houses thorough the cytye of London.
                     And at Poulys, by the sayd chaū
                        celler standyng vpon the steppes at the quyerdore, were the sayd tydynges denounced vnto the people. And vpon the morow folowynge, ye sayd chaunceller wych other bysshoppes and tēporall lordes, wyth a generall procession of the mayre and comynaltye of the cytye yode from Poulys to westmynster on fote, and offered at saynt Edwardes shryne, &amp; so retourned to theyr owne houses. Thanne kyng Hēry wyth hys prysoners shypped at Calays, and so landed at Douer. And after he had ben at Caunterbury, and there made hys offerynge vnto saynt Thomas / he than spedde hym on hys iournay tyll he came vnto Eltham, where he rested hym a season.
                     Upon the .xxiii. day of Nouembre he was met with the mayre &amp; hys bretherne vpō the Blak heth / &amp; so conueyed wyth all honour thorugh the cytye vnto westmynster, wherein dyuers places of the sayd cytye, as the brydge &amp; crosse in chepe, were ordeyned certayn pagentes to the kynges great comforte. The maner wherof, with all processyons and other seremonies I passe ouer for letthyng of the tyme.
                     In thys yere also Sigismunde Emperour of Almayn came into England. And in the moneth of May, by the kynges cōmaundement &amp; .vii. daye of the sayd moneth, the mayre and bretherne mette hym vpō Blakheth. And at saynt Georges met hym the kyng and hys lordes in great nō
                        bre / and so conueyed hym vnto westmynster with great honour, &amp; lodged hym in hys own palays. And shortly after was the feast of saynte George holden at wyndesore / whyche before was deferred for hys cōmyng. In tyme of whyche solempnyte durynge ye dyuyne seruyce / the kynge kepte the astate. But in syttyng at the feest▪ the Emperour kept ye astate. The seruice &amp; sotyltees of whiche feeste, with syttynge of ye lordes after theyr degrees I passe ouer. And shortly after came the duke of Holande into this lande, for certayne causes concernynge the Emperour. whome the kynge honourably receyued / and lodged hym in the bisshoppes palays of Ely in Holbourne. And so the kynge entreated and chered these straungers that for the season that they taryed in Englande, they laye here at the kynges coste and charge.
                     
                        And ye emperoure and he were made knyghtes of the garter / and also a greate duke of ye emperours named duke of Bryga. And whan the emperour hadde taryed vpō .vii. wekes and odde dayes in Englande / which after some wryters was to thentent to set an vnyte and reste bytwene the Frenche kynge and kynge Henry: he after toke mynde to retourne into Almayne▪ whom the kynge for hys comforte and nedes that he had to do at Caleys, accompanyed hym thyder / where eyther wyth gyftes &amp; thankes departed from other. And the duke of Hollande went wyth the emperour into Hollande and other countrees.
                     whyle the kynge was thus at Calys / to hym came thyder vnder saufe conduyt the duke of Burgoyne, and hadde wyth the kynge dyuers communycacyons / and after retourned to hys owne. And soone after ye kyng retourned into Englande / and came to westmynster vpon saynte Lukes euyn or the .xvii. daye of October.
                     Thys yere and season whyle the kynge was at Calayes, yt is to mene vppon the daye of Assumpcyon of our blessed lady / the duke of Bedforde accompanyed wyth the erle of Marche and other lordes, hadde a greate conflycte and batayle wyth dyuers carikkes of Ieane and other shyppes. where after longe and sore fyght, ye honour fyll to hym and hys Englysshemen / to the greate losse of the straungers bothe of theyr men, and also of theyr shyppes / as some drowned, &amp; .iii. of the grettest of theyr carykkes taken.

                     THys yere the kynge holdynge hys parlyamēt at westmynster / to hym was graunted by auctoryt of the same a Fyftene. And by a conuocacyon of the clergy was graū
                        ted to hym a dyme, for the mayntenaunce of hys warrys. wheruppon newe prouysyon was made for hys seconde vyage into Fraunce.
                     By authoryte of this parlyament also, Rycharde whyche was sonne &amp; heyre of ye erle of Cambrydge, which erle was put to deth at Southampton, was created duke of yorke / whiche after was maryed vnto Cecyle ye doughter of Daraby erle of westmerlande, by reason that he brought his wardshyp of the kynge. By the whiche lady Cecyle he hadde Henry that dyed yonge, Edward that after was kynge, Edmunde erle of Rutlande, Anne duchesse of Exceter, Elyzabeth duchesse of Suffolke, George duke of Clarence, Rycharde duke of Glouceter and after kynge, and Margaret duchesse of Burgoyne. And whā all thynge was redy for the kynges vyage / he ordeyned Iohn̄ duke of Bedforde hys brother protectour of thys land in the tyme of his absence. And that done / he wyth hys lordes aboute wytsontyde toke hys shyppyng at Southamptō, and so sayled into Normandye / and landed vpon Lāmas daye at a place called Toke or Towke. And after he was wyth hys hoste there landed, for so moche as he was warned of certayne shyppes of warre ye entendyd to do some harme in Englande beynge than vppon the see: he therfore to wythstāde theyr malycyouse purpose, sent the

erle of Marche, the erle of Huntyngdon, wyth other, to scowre the see. The whyche encountred the sayde enemyes / and after a lōge and cruell fyght them vēquysshed &amp; ouercame. whyche fyght was vpon the daye of saynt Romayne or the .ix. day of Auguste, as hath the Frenche cronycle. And of the French nauy, was chyefe capytayne the vycount of Narbon / whych in that fyght was taken with great plēty of treasour. For as sayth Gaguinus, he with one Mountney an other capytayne, to whom ye sowdyours wages was cōmytted / of one assent of theyr synguler lucre wythhelde the sayde wages. By reason wherof whan they shuld ioyne in batayll, many of them wyth theyr shyppes withdrew, &amp; last theyr capitayns in the daūger of theyr enemyes. But this is lyke to be a fayned excuse of ye sayd Gagwyne, to saue the honoure of the Frēchmen / as he many tymes semblably dothe in many places of hys boke.
                     Then to retourne vnto kyng Henry / whan he was thus landed, he sent vnto ye rulers of the town of Towke and had it vnto hym delyuered. But the castell was defended agayn hym tyll saynt Laurence daye folowyng / the whyche he gaue after vnto hys brother the duke of Clarēce, wyth all the sygnory therunto belongynge.
                     And thys done, the kynge spedde hym toward Cane, &amp; layde his syege therunto vpon ye .xvii. day of the foresayd moneth of August. The whych contynued tyll the feest of the Natyuyte of our lady / &amp; than won vpon ye ꝑty yt the duke of Clarēce assawted. But the castel helde by apoyntemēt, yf no rescouse were had tyll the .xiiii. day folowyng. At whych day ye sayd castel was delyuered with other .xiiii strōge holdes, which had before takē ye same apoyntmēt. Than the kynge made the foresayd duke of Clarence capytayne of the sayd town &amp; castell. And in this passetyme were dyuers other townes &amp; strōge holdes goten, by dyuers of ye kynges retynew / as ye erle Marshall, the erle of warwyke &amp; other / ye which wan Louers, Faloys, Newelyn, Cherburgth, Argētyne, &amp; Bayons the citye, with many other strōge abbays &amp; pilys. Thā the king helde there saynt Georges feest, and dubbyd there .xv. knyghtꝭ of ye Bath / &amp; after cōtynued his warres duryng this mayres yere, in wynnyng vpon the Frēchmen by apoyntementꝭ and otherwyse / wherof the cyrcumstaūce were very longe to declare in order.
                     In this yere also, &amp; vpō the festfull day of Ester, tyll a chaunce in Lōdō / which to ye fere of all good crystē men is necessary to be noted.A fraye on Eester day For vpō the hygh &amp; solēpne day, by excytyng of ye deuyll &amp; yll disposyciō of .ii. women, that is to mene the wyfe of the lorde Straūge, &amp; ye wyfe of syr Iohn̄ Trussell knyght / such vnkyndnes fyll bytwene theyr two husbādes, yt eyther wold haue slayne other within ye parysh chyrch of saynt Dūstanes in the Eest. In ꝑtyng of which persons dyuers men were hurt &amp; sore woūded / &amp; one named Thom̄ Petwardē slayne out of hand, which was a freeman &amp; fysshemōger of the cyty. Than lastly both frayers were takē &amp; brought vnto the Coūtour in ye Pultry. And for the sayd lorde Straūge was demed culpable of ye begīnyng of this fray / he therfore vpō the sōday folowyng, &amp; for suspendyng of the chyrche, was denoūced acursyd at Poulys crosse &amp; in all parysshe chyrches of Londō. And fynally he was demed to open penaunce &amp; dyd it / and made greate amendes vnto the wyfe of the sayde Thomas for the deth of her husbād.
                     And in the ende of thys yere, where at Lōdō was sold for .ii.s. a busshell.

                     IN the begynnyng of thys mayres yere, and fyrste yere of the kyng / that is to say the .vii. daye of ye moneth of Nouembre, the corps of ye excellent prynce kyng Henry the fyft was wyth great solempnyte and honour brought vnto the monastery of westmynster / and there at the fete of saynt Edward wyth due reuerēce enterred / to whose soule Iesus be mercyfull. And vpon the .ix. day of ye sayd moneth, was a parlyament called at westmynster. By reason whereof, the kynges gouernaunce durynge hys nonage was prouyded for / wyth all the rule of bothe realmes of Englād and of Fraunce. And by auctoryte of the same, the duke of Glouceter syr Humfrey, was ordeyned protectoure of England / and duke Iohn̄ of Bedforde regent of Fraunce. And durynge the parlyament / was graūted vnto ye kyng for a subsydie for .iii. yeres, v. nobles of euery sacke of wolle that shulde passe out of the lande.

In thys moneth of Marche also was the town of Poūt

Melane deliuered by apoyntmente vnto the regent of Fraunce. Of the whych apoyntemēt one artycle was, that all horses, abylmētes of warre, harneys, and other, shulde be lefte within the sayd place / and also golde and syluer and other iewelles there to remayne hooly. And yf that any persone were within ye holde founde, whiche before tyme had ben gylty or consentynge to the dethe of the duke of Burgoyne / that he shulde be delyuered to the regent / and not to take any benefyte or pryuylege by that appoyntment.
                     And this yere the west gate of the cytye called Newgate, was newly buylded and repayred by the executours of Rycharde whytyngton late mayre of Londō. And this yere after mydsomer fyll great water or rayne / so that for the more party euery daye atwene the begynnynge of Iuly and ende of Septembre, it rayned lytell or moche / and yet that not withstandynge, that yere was cōuenyent plentye of al grayne, so that whete passed not eyght shyllynges at Lōdon, and malte fyue shyllynges.

                           •
                        owe he was borne to ye chare with glad semblant &amp; mery chere, and so came to Kyngeston that nyght / and vpon ye morow vnto his manour of Kyngeston. Upon wednysday, the quene syttynge in her chare and he vpon her lappe, passed with great tryumphe thorughe the cytye / and so vnto westmynster, where than was holden his parlyament / &amp; there set in his kyngly mageste within the parlyamēt chambre amonge all his lordes, where the speker of the parlyament made a famous preposicion / wherof the effecte was, of the grace yt god had endewed the realme with, for the presence of so toward a prynce and soueraygne gouernour as he was, with many other wordes of commendacyon, which I passe ouer. The .xxvi. day of the same moneth of Nouēbre / the kynge with ye quene remoued from westmynster vnto waltham holy crosse. And after he had there a season soiourned / here moued vnto Hertford, where he held his Crystmasse, and ye kyng of Scottes with hym. And ye foresayd parlyamēt was iourned vnto ye .xx. daye of Crystmas. In ye whiche parlyament amonge other actes, was ordeyned yt what prysoner yt for graūd or pety treason was cōmytted to warde, &amp; after wylfully brake the same, it shulde

be demed pety treason / and that the goodes of hym so escapynge, shulde be forfeyted to the lorde of that soyle that they were founde in. In the moneth of Februari, syr Iames steward kynge of Scottes maried in the face of the churche of saynt mary Ouereys in Southwerke, dame Iohane ye duchesse doughter of Clarence / whiche was doughter vnto the erle of Somerset fyrste husbande vnto the sayde duchesse. And the feest was holden in the bysshop of wynchesters place by. And soone after vpon the xiii. day of February, the foresayde parlyament beynge agayne holden at westmynster / for brekynge of the foresayde acte of brekynge of pryson, syr Iohan Mortymer was accused by a yoman named wyllyam Kynge and seruaunt vnto syr Robert Scot knyght and keper of ye towre of London, of dyuers poyntes of treason as folowen. Fyrst he coūseyled with the sayd wyllyam Kynge to the ende to breke out of pryson / and promysed to hym for the same, the yerely value of xl.li. lande, &amp; in processe an erledome. Also the sayd Mortymer shulde saye that he wolde go into wales vnto the erle of the Marches / and there he wolde rayse .xl.M. mē, and with that power he wolde entre this lande, and stryke of the heddes of the lorde protectour and of the bysshop of wynchester, to the entent that he myght tell or play with some of his money.
                     And ferthermore he accused hym, that the sayde Mortymer shulde say, that the erle of Marche shulde be kynge by ryght enherytaunce / &amp; that he hymself was nexte ryghtfull heyre to the sayd crowne after the sayd erle of Marche. wherfore yf the sayde erle wold not take vpon hym ye crowne &amp; rule of ye lande, he sayde that he elles wolde. And ouer this the sayd wyllyam. alledged to the sayde syr Iohan Mortymer, that he shulde say that yf he fayled of his purpose, and myght not wyn̄e vnto the erle of Marches, that than he wolde sayle vnto ye Dolphyn and ayde and take his partye / where he wyst well he shuld be accepted, and haue good ayde of hym to brynge aboute his purpose. All whiche maters were duely approued by the sayde wyllyam agayne the sayde syr Iohan, before the lordes and comons of the sayde parlyament / for yt whiche treasons he was after drawen and hanged.
                     In this yere also the duke of Bedforde beynge in Fraunce as regene, warred strongly vpon ye Dolphyn, &amp; wanne from hym many stronge holdes and townes / as Crotey, Basyde, Ryol, Rulay, Gyroūde, Basyle, Mermoūde, Mylham, Femel, Seintace, Iensak, Mauron, Duras, Mountsuer, La venak, Palageeu, Cerneys, Noelam, Cusak, and Doual with dyuers other / and so contynued tyll he came vnto Uerneyll in Perche. The whiche he helde so streyght, that lastly Gyrande the captayne therof agreed to delyuer it by a certayne day, excepte he were rescowed. After whiche appoyntment so taken / the sayde Gyrande as wytnesseth Gaguinus, sent worde to Charles the .viii. of ye name or ye .vii. after dyuers wryters, which of his fautoures was than accōpted for kyng of Fraūce. And he in all possyble hast, sent thyder ye duke of Alanson, ye erle of Turon̄ or of Douglas, of Bowgham or Boucam, of Daumayll, &amp; ye vicoūt of Nerbon̄, with a strōg power of Armenakkes, scottes, &amp; Frēchemē / ye which host or it myght approch to ye sayd towne to make rescouse, ye day expired, &amp; it vnto ye duke deliuered. whā ye duke of Alāsō was asserteyned of ye deliuere of ye towne, he toke his aduise of ye other capitaynes, whether it was better to retourn

consyderyng the towne was yolden, or to gyue batayll vnto the Englishe men. But fynally for no reproche shuld be to them arected as they had fled for fere / they kept on theyr iournany, &amp; pyght theyr felde in a playne nere vnto the sayd town of Uernoyl. where they beynge strongely enbataylled, vpon the .vii. day of the moneth of August, the duke of Bedford wyth hys retynue gaue to thē sharpe and cruell batayll / the whyche endured longe wythoute knowlege of vyctory.
                     But fynally by goddes ordenaūce and power, the vyctyry fyl to the Englysshe partye, to the greate losse of theyr enemyes. For in the fyghte was slayne / as testyfyeth the French Gaguyne, the erles of Turon, and Boucam, of Daumayle, wyth the Uycounte of Narbon̄, and dyuers other men of name. And of the commons were slayne to the nombree of fyue thousande. And there was taken the duke of Alanson, the Marshall of Fraunce, and other. But ye englysshe wryters affermeth .x.M. to be slayne and mo.

In so moche that the commōs of the cytye herynge thereof, shytte in theyr shoppes &amp; sped them thyder in great nombre. And lykely it was to haue ensued great effusyō of blode shortly therupon, ne had ben the dyscrescion of ye mayre and hys brethern, that exorted ye people by all polytyke meane to kepe the kynges peas. And in this passe tyme, the archebysshop of Caū
                        torbury, wyth the prynce of Portyngale and other, toke greate laboure vpon them to pacyfye thys varyaūce betwene the lord protectour and the bysshope / in so moche that they rode betwene theym .viii. tymes or they might brynge them to any resonable conformyte. Than lastly they agreed to stāde to the rule of the regēt, or of suche as he wolde assygne. wherupō ye cytye was set in a more quiete. Thā the bisshop of wynchester wrote a letter vnto ye duke of Bedforde or lord regēt, wherof ye tenure ensueth.
                     RIght hyghe and myghty price &amp; ryght noble, and after one leuest erthly lord / I recommaunde me vnto your grace wyth all myne hert. And as ye desyre the welfare of the kyng our soueraygne lorde, &amp; of hys realmes of Englande &amp; of Fraunce, &amp; your owne weale wyth all yours / haste you hyder, for by my trouthe &amp; ye tary longe, we shall put thys lāde in ieopardy wyth a felde / such a brother ye haue here god make hym a good man. For your wysdome knoweth well, that the profyte of Fraūce standeth in the welfare of England. Ryght hygh &amp; myghty prynce, I beseche you holde mayster Iohan Estcourt your coūcellour excused of hys taryeng / for it is moche agayne hys wyll. But the counsayll here hath made hym do cōtrary hys mynde. And that it may lyke you to gyue credēce vnto your chamberlayne syr Robert Boteler. And the blessed Trinite kepe you. wryten in great haste at Lōdon the laste day of Octobre.
                     Upō the .x. day of Ianuary nexte ensuynge, ye sayde duke of Bedforde wyth hys wyfe came vnto London. And with thē came also the sayd bysshop of wynchester. And the mayre &amp; the cytezyns receyued hym at Merton, &amp; cōueyed hym thorugh ye cytye vnto westmynster / where he was lodged in ye kyngꝭ palays / &amp; the bysshop of wynchester was lodged wythin ye abbottes lodgynge.
                     Than vpō the morow folowynge or ye .xi. day of Ianuary / y• mayre presented the regēt wyth a payere of basyns of syluer &amp; ouer gylte, &amp; in them a .M. marke of golde. But the bisshop had so incenced hym agayn the cytye, that they receyued but a small thāke for all theyr labour and coste. Upon ye .xxi. day of February, thā began a great coūsayl at saīt Albonys / and after it was adiourned vnto

Northampton. But for due conclusyons myghte nat be dryuen by the sayde counsayll / therfore vppon the xxv. daye of Marche ensuynge, was called a parlyament at Leyceter / the whyche endured tyll the xv. daye of Iuny folowynge. Thys was cleped of the comon people the parlyament of battes. The cause was, for proclamacyons were made, that men shuld leue theyr swerdes &amp; other wepyns in theyr innys, the people toke great battes &amp; stauys in theyr neckes / and so folowed theyr lordes &amp; maysters vnto the parlyament. And whan ye wepyn was inhybyted them / thanne they toke stones &amp; plūmettes of lede, and trussed them secretly in theyr sleuys &amp; bosomys. Durynge the parliament / amōge other notable thynges for the weale of the realme, the varyaunce that was betwene the forsayd lordes was herin debated &amp; argued. In so moche that the duke of Glouceter put in a byll of cōplaynt, agayn the bysshop conteynyng .vi. artycles. wherof the fyrst was, that where the lorde protectour wolde haue had his lodgynge wythin the towre of London / he was by the comforte &amp; ayde defended &amp; let of the bysshop, and of Richard wydeuile esquyer thā being Lyeutenaunt of the same. The secōd was, for that that the bysshop wolde haue remoued ye kyng from Elthm̄ / &amp; haue sette hym at hys gouernaūce, without the aduyce and counsayle of the lorde protectour. The thyrde was, that whan the duke was enformed of the bysshoppes entent / and he entendynge accordynge to his offyce and duetie, in peasyble wyse to haue rydē to ye kyng to haue gyuē vpō him attendaunce: ye bysshop entēdynge ye distrucciō of ye duke, assēbled a great multytude of men of armes and archers in Southwarke / &amp; ther drewe the cheyne at the brydge fote, and set vp pypes &amp; other engynes to stoppe the kynges hye way / &amp; ordeyned mē to stande in chambres and solers to throwe stones / and by theyr ordenaū
                        ces and pollycy, to haue destroyed ye duke and his company. The .iiii. artycle was, that kynge Henry the fyft shulde by his lyfe tyme shewe vnto ye sayde duke, that by the openynge of a spaynell, a man was taken behynd a tapet in one of the kynges chābres. The whiche man after examyned by the erle of Arundel / confessed that he was sent thyther by ye sayde bysshop, to the ende to murther kynge Henry the forth. After whiche cōfessyon / the sayd erle let sakke that man, and so cast hym into the Thamys. The fyft was, that the sayd Henry the fyft beynge prynce and heyre parant to the crowne / the sayd bysshop shuld come vnto hym and say, that for somoche as his father was vexed with greuous sekenes, &amp; was not apte to come in conuersacion of the people, nor myght not conueniently gyde the realme / that he therfore shulde take vp on hym the rule and gouernaunce of the same, and put his father from all kyngly power. The .vi. and last artycle was, that sediciously the sayd bysshop hadde by his letters sent lately vnto the duke of Bedforde / wrongfully accused hym, in that he shulde areyse the kynges people, and iuparde this lande by a felde / contrary to the kynges peas and comon wele of this lande.
                     All which articles were by ye bysshop wele and suffycyently answered and replyed / so yt he layde from hym the blame. And fynally by the prouydent counsayle of the lorde regent / al the sayd artycles and matiers of varyaunce atwene the sayd two lordes hangynge, were put to the examynacyon and iudgmente with the assystence of ye lordes of the parliamēt, of

Henry the archebysshop of Caunterbury, of Thomas duke of Exceter, of Iohn̄ duke of Northfolk / Thomas bysshop of Durhm̄, of Phylype bysshop of worceter, or Iohn̄ bysshop of Bathe, of Humfrey thā erle of Stafforde, of Rauffe lorde Cornewell, &amp; of mayster wyllyam Alnewyke than keper of the preuy seale. The whych lordes wyth assystence of the other lordes of the parlyament, made a decre and a warde / so that eyther party toke other by the hande, wyth frēdly &amp; louyng wordes / none hauyng amē
                        des of other, except the bysshope had wordes of submyssyō vnto the duke, in requyryng hym of hys fauoure &amp; good lordshyp. And ye accorde thus fynysshed, the parlyament was adiourned tyll after Easter. Uppon whytsondaye folowynge, was a solempne feest holden at Leyceter forsayde / where the regente dubbyd kynge Henry knyghte. And than forthwyth the kynge dubbyd Rycharde duke of yorke, that after was father to kynge Edwarde. Also he dubbyd knyghtes, the sonne and heyre of the duke Iohan, duke of Northfolke, and the erles of Oxenforde and westmerlande, wyth other lordes and gentylmen to the noumbre of .xxxiiii.
                     And after that feeste wyth all honour was endyd / the kynge wyth the regente and other of hys lordes drew towarde London. And so the regente contynued wyth the kynge in Englande, by the full terme of thys mayres yere.

                     IN thys .v. yere and moneth of February / the regent with hys wyfe &amp; housholde meyny passed the see vnto Calays, and so thorugh Pycardy into Fraunce. But or he departed thens, that is to meane vpon the daye of annuncyacion of our Lady / the bysshop of wynchester within the churche of our Lady of Calays was created cardynall, by auctoryte of ye bulles of pope Martyne the .v. of ye name. And after that solēpnyte don / the regente toke hym on hys ryghte hande, &amp; so conueyed hym vnto hys lodgynge.
                     Thys yere was vnresonable of wederyng / for it reyned moste part contynually frome Easter to Myghelmasse, where thorugh hay and corne was greatly hyndered.
                     And in thys yere the duke of Alē
                        son, that before was taken prysoner at the batayll of Uernell in Perche, was delyuered for a raunson of .ii.C M. scutes of golde as testyfyeth Gaguinus, whyche is fyfty .M. marke sterlyng money.
                     In thys yere also the erle of Salysbury, whych of dyuers wryters is named the good erle / accompanyed wyth the erle of Suffolke, the lorde Talbot, and other, layde a stronge syege vnto the cytye of Orleaunce, &amp; helde the cytezyns very streyght / and maugre the duke of Orleaunce and the Marshal of Fraunce thanne named Boussaak, the Englysshemen wanne from theym dyuers stronge holdes adioynynge to the cytye / and forced them to brenne a greate parte of the subbarbes of the cytye.
                     But sorowe it is to tell and doolfull to wryte, whyle one day the sayd good erle syr Thomas Mountagu,

rested hym at a bay wyndow, and be helde the compas of the cytie, and talked with his familiers / a gonne was leueyled out of the cytie from a place vnknowen, whiche brake the tymbre or stone of the wyndowe with suche vyolence, that the pecys therof all to quasshed the face of the noble erle / in suche wyse that he dyed within thre dayes folowyng. Upon whose soule &amp; all crysten Ihesu haue mercy Amē.
                     This after dyuers wryters was initium malorum. For after this myshappe, the Englysshmen loste rather ther than wanne / so that lytell and lytell they loste all theyr possessyon in Fraūce. And all be it that somewhat they gate after / yet for one that they wanne they loste thre, as after shall appere.

                     THis solēpne coronacyon with all honour and ioye finysshed prouycyon was made for the kynges iournay into Fraunce. In whyche passetyme, that is to meane vpon ye xxiii. daye of Ianuary, an heretyke was brent in Smythfelde.
                     And vpon the morowe next folowynge, was in that felde foughten a stronge fyght / betwene Iohn̄ Upton̄ Appellant, &amp; Iohn̄ Downe Defendant. But for they quyt theym bothe so manfully / the kynge at length relesed theyr quarell, and pardoned thē of theyr trespas.
                     Than vppon saynt Georges day folowyng, or the .xxiii. day of Apryll / the kynge toke shyppynge at Douer and landed the same daye at Calays / hauynge in hys company .ii. dukes, of yorke and Northfolke, thre bysshoppes, of Bathe, Ely, and Rochester, eyght erles, that is to meane, of Huntyngdon, Stafforde, warwyke, Orenforde, Deuynshyre, Morteyne, of Ewe, and of Urmund / and .xi. barons, that is to saye, lord Bowchier, Beawmounde, Typtost, Fytzwater, Roos, Arundell, Awdeley, Fawcunbrydge, Gray, Codnoor, the lorde Scroope, and the lorde wellys.
                     In thys tyme and season that the kynge laye thus at Calays / many skyrmysshes were foughten betwene the Englysshemen and the Frenchemen in dyuers partyes of Fraunce. And greately the Frenchemen preuayled by ye helpe of a woman / which they as before is touched named the Mayden of god. So that lastly she wyth her company came to a towne called Compeyne, to the entent to remoue the syege layde thereunto by ye duke of Burgoyne and other of the Englysshe capytaynes. And theruppon the .xxiii. daye of May, she gaue batayll vnto Englysshmen and Burgonyons / and faughte wyth theym longe tyme. But in the ende, by the manhode of a Burgonyon knyghte named syr Iohn̄ Luxemburghe, she was taken on lyue, and her company dystressed, and she caryed to the citie of Roan / and there kept a season, for so moch as she feyned her with child. But whanne the contrary of it was knowen / she was there foriuged and brente.
                     Of thys woman Gaguynus maketh a great processe, of her parenty, and of her fyrste takynge vppon her / whereof a parte I entende to shewe after in the .vi. yere of Charles nexte folowynge kynge of Fraunce.
                     And in thys tyme and season, one Rychard Hounden wolle pakker of London, was conuycte of heresy and brent at towre Hylle. Than kyng Hēry thus lodgynge at Calays, was asserteyned of the takyng of the foresayd woman, by the letters of ye duke of Burgoyne. And after he toke hys small iournayes tyll he came into Fraunce, and so vnto Parys. Of whose cytezyns he was honourably receyued, &amp; taken for the soueraygne &amp; kynge / and there so taryed all thys mayres yere. In whych seasō as wytnesseth Gaguynus / the Frenchemen wan dyuers holdes of Englyshemen and Burgonyōs in the countrey of Brye. And a capytayne named Barbasan scomfited .viii.M. Englyshmē and Burgonyōs, at a place called in latyne Cathalamencis, as affermeth the foresayd auctour.

                     Than the kyng rode forth a softe pase tyll he came at the entre of Corn hylle. where vpon ye hylle was ordeyned a tabernacle of curyous worke / in the which stode dame Sapyence, and about her the .vii. artes or scyences lyberall / as fyrst gramer, logike, rhetoryke, musyke, arithmetyke, geometry, and astronomye / euerych of them exercysynge theyr connynge &amp; facultye, and the lady her selfe hadde thys speche to the kynge.

                           Lo I chyefe pryncesse, dame Sapience,
                           Shewe vnto you this sentence of scripture / 
                           Kynges that ben most of excellence,
                           By me they reygne, and moste ioye endure.
                           For through my helpe and my besy cure,
                           To encrease theyr glory and theyr hygh renowne / 
                           They shall of wysdome haue full possession.
                        
                     
                     Than the kynge passed on tyll he came to the conduyte in Cornehylle. where was set a pageāt made cercle wyse / &amp; in the summet or toppe therof was set a chyld of wonderfull beaute, apparayled lyke a kyng. Upō whose ryght hand satte lady Mercy, &amp; vpon the lefte hande lady Trouth / and ouer them stode dame Clennese embrasyng the kynges trone. Then before the kynge stode two iudges &amp; viii. sergeauntes of the coyfe. And dame Clennesse had thys speche to ye vi. Henry the kynge.

                           
                              Lo by the sentence of prudent Salomon,
                              Mercy and ryght preseruyn euery kynge.
                              And I Clennesse obserued by reason,
                              Kepe his trone from myschyefe and fassynge,
                              And maketh it stronge with longe abydynge.
                              So I conclude that we ladyes thre,
                              A kynge preserue in longe prosperite.
                           
                           
                              And Dauyd sayd, the psalme beryth wytnesse / 
                              Lorde god thy dome thou to the kynge / 
                              And gyue to hym thy trouth and ryghtwysnesse,
                              The kynges sonne here on erth lyuynge.
                              And thus declared he by his wrytynge
                              That kynges and prynces shuld about thē drawe,
                              Folke that ben trewe and well lerned in lawe.
                           
                        
                     
                     After hys speche thus declared / ye kynge rode forth a quycker pase tyll he came vnto the conduyt in Chepe. where were ordeyned dyuers wellys as ye welle of mercy, ye welle of grace, and the welle of pyte. And at euery welle a lady standynge, that mynystred the water of euery welle to such as wold aske it / and that water was turned into good wyne.
                     About these welles were sette dyuers trees wyth flouryshynge leues and fruytes, as orenges, almandes pomegarnardes, olyues, lymones, dates, pepys, quynces, blaūderelles, peches, &amp; other more comon fruytes, as costerdes, wardēs pomewardōs,

rycardōs, damysyns, and plūmes, wyth other fruytes longe to reherse / ye which were so cūnyngly wrought, that to many they appered naturall trees growynge.
                     In the bordour of thys delicious place whych was named Paradyse, stode two forgrowen faders, resemblynge Enocke and Hely / the whych hadde thys sayenge to the kynge.

                           
                              Ennok fyrste with a benygne chere,

                              And that none enemyes haue of the power / 
                              Nor that no chylde of false iniquyte,

                              This olde Ennok to processe can well tell,
                              Prayed for the kynge as he rode by the welle.
                           
                           
                              After Helias with his sokkys hore,
                              Sayde well deuoutely sokynge on the kynge / 
                              God conserue the and kepe euermore,
                              And make the blyssed here on erth lyuynge
                              And preserue the in all maner thynge,
                              And specyall amonge kynges all,
                              In enemyes handes that thou neuer fall.
                           
                        
                     
                     And that speche fynyshed / ye kyng rode forthe a lytell forther. And there was ordeyned a tower garnysshed wyth the armys of Englande and of Fraunce. Thys tower was wonderfull to beholde / for there was shewed in order the tytle whyche the kynge hadde vnto the crowne of Fraunce. And vpryght by thys tower stode .ii. grene trees artifycyally wyth grene leuys garnysshed and wrought / that one verynge the genelogy of saynte Edward, and that other of saynt Lewys / and garnyshed with leopardes and flourdelyces. And ouer these .ii. foresayde trees was ordeyned the thyrde / whyche was made the forthe spryng of Iesse / wherin was shewed the genelogy of our blessed lady sette out in moste curyous wyse. And vpō the front of thys tower were wryten these verses folowynge.

                     Than from thys the kyng passed on tyll he came at the cōduyt at Paulys gate / where was pyghte a celestyall trone / and therein was sette a personage of the Trinyte, wyth a multytude of aungels playenge and syngynge vpon all instrumentes of musyk. And vpon the front of ye sayd trone, was wrytten these verses or balades folowynge / the whych were spoken by the father vnto the kyng.

                              And cause his nobles thorugh the worlde shyne.
                           
                        
                     
                     ANd thys done he entred the churcheyarde / where he was mette wyth processyon of the deane &amp; the chanōs of Paulys. wyth whome

also in pontificalibus came the archbysshop of Cauntorbury and chaūceler of Englande, with the bysshop of Lyncolne, of Bathe, of Salysbury, of Norwyche, of Ely, &amp; of Rochestre / the whiche so conueyed hym into the churche, and there made his oblacyons. And that done he toke agayne his stede at the west dore of Paules, and so rode forth vnto westmynker / where agayne he was of the abbot &amp; couent receyued with procession and by them cōueyed vnto saynt Edwardes shryne, and there taryed a whyle Te deum was songe in the Quyer.

                     This yere also by reason of ye sowdyours of Calays, a restraynte was made there of the wolles / for they were not cōtēt of theyr wages. wherfore the regent of Fraūce beynge thā Capytayne of Calays, came downe thyder in the easter weke. At whiche tyme beynge the wednesdaye in the sayde weke, many sowdyoures were arested and put in warde. And whan he had so done, he rode to Tyrewyn / &amp; there by the meanes of the bysshop of Tyrewyn, he maried ye erle of saint Paules doughter / and shortly after returned to Calays, and caused the sayde sowdyours to be enquyred of / and fynally .iiii. of them were demed to dye. whiche .iiii. yt is to say Iohan Maddely; Iohan Lundaye, Thomas Palmer, and Thomas Talbot, were beheded at Calays the .xi. day of Iuny.

Contynuynge the foresayd warre in Fraūce / the towne of saynt Denys which is within .ii.

Of the whiche two of aduenture to sauegarde them selfe fledde to the sayd thycke busshe, where the cowarde Frenche knyghte stode. The whiche whan he hadde espyed and lerned of theym, that the Frenche partye hadde wonne the felde / he became so coragyous, that he forced the sayde two Englysshemen to become his prysoners / and so with theym entredde the hoste of the Frenchemē, and bare a countenaūce as he hadde wonne theym in the foresayd fyght. But at lengthe whan all his demeanoure was knowen / he was for his feate hadde in great derysyon, and by his chefe capytayne

named Guyllā de saynt Albyne pryued of his prysones.
                     And in this season also the erle of Arundell, whiche in Normandy had manly borne hym / herynge that one Hyrus a Frenche capytayne hadde fortyfyed a strōge castell named Gerborym before distroyed of Englysshe men, toke with hym a certayn of sow dyoures, and gyrde the castell with a stronge syege / and assawted it by sondry tymes māfully, as sayth the Frē

And that vyctory so by ye Frēche men optayned / that castell was to ye hurte of the Englysshemen reedyfyed / and a place called Dyepp̄ with other also wonne from them.

And in the latter ende of Decembre this yere ended the parlyamente holden at westmynster, begon at Myghelmas terme before passed.
                     This yere also by meanes of the pope than Eugeny the .iiii, at Aras in Pycardy was holden a great coū
                        sayle, for to conclude an vnyon and peas atwene the two realmes of Englande and Fraunce. To the whiche coūsayle, by the sayd popes cōmaūdment came as a persone indyfferent, Nicholas cardynall of ye holy crosse, with syxe Romayne bysshoppes to hym assygned. And for the kynge of Englandes partye was there assygned the cardynall of wynchester, the archebysshop of yorke, the erles of Huntyngdon̄ and of Suffolke, with dyuers other. And for the Frenche kynge, was there the duke of Burbon̄, the erle of Rychemount, ye archebysshop of Raynys chaunceler than of Fraūce, the deane of Patys with many other whiche I passe ouer. There were also as fortherers of the matyer, the cardynal of Cyprys. And for the duke of Burgoyn̄, was there the bysshop of Cambray, and Nycholas Raulyn the sayd dukes chaunceler, with dyuers erles and barons of that duchy. And for the duke of Brytayne, were ther the erles of Alenson and of Barre with other / ouer and aboue dyuers oratoures appoynted for the countye of Flaundres. At whiche assemble and counsayll thus holden as testifieth dyuers wryters / many great offers by meane of ye aboue named cardynal of holy crosse or

                        sayll was deferred tyll an other day.

At whiche day the Englysshemen entendynge the cōtinuaunce of warre, absentyd theym selfe. wherwith the sayd cardynall beynge dyscontented, made meanes of an entreaty of peas atwene Charles, that toke vpon hym as Frenche kynge, and Phylyp duke of Burgoyn. wherof the sayd Charles was so fayne, ye for stablysshynge of the peas, and to satysfye hym for ye murther of his father / he gaue vnto hym all the vtter boundes of Champeyn̄ marching vpon Burgoin, with dyuers cyties, as seynt Quyntyne, Corbie, Peron̄, Abbeuyle, and other, with the countie of Poytyaw &amp; lordshyp of Macon̄. And as wytnesseth ye foresayde Gagwyne / many mo thynges were vnto the duke by the sayde Charles ꝓmysed, whiche after theyr bothe dethes were broken and stode for nought. After whiche peas thus atwene them confermed and proclaymed / the sayd duke became vtter enemye to the kynge of Englande, as after shall appere. And soone after the sayd duke began his ordre of the lyle and the golden flese, and ordeyned certayne knyghtes of that ordre / and made therunto many statutes and ordenaunces, wherof dyuers were lyke vnto the statutes of the garter. And in the ende of this yere and .xiiii. day of Septembre / at Roan̄ in Normandye died the noble prynce Iohn̄ duke of Bedforde and regent of Fraunce / and was after with great solempnytie buryed within the churche of notir Dame of the same cytie, where for hym are founded wonderfull thynges after some mēnes reporte. But for I fynde therof in wrytynge nothynge, I passe it ouer.

                     Than the other hoste of Frenchemen herynge of this rumour in the cytie / anone drewe nere, &amp; entred by saynt Iames gate without moche resystence / and so enioyed the cytye at theyr pleasure.

                        ided and scorned of ye Frēchenacyon out of all mesure. And whan the cytye of Parys was thus subdued to the Frenche dominion / anone ye Englyssh people that there abode vnder fyne and raunsom, were sworne to Charles the seuenth than takynge vpon hym as Frenche kynge. And anone after were wonne from ye Englyssh power, the holdes named Creoll and saynt Germayne. In whiche passe tyme and season, for to strēgthe and haue the gydynge of Normādy / the duke of yorke encompaned with the erle of Salysbury, and the lorde of Fawcoūbrydg sailed into Fraūce. And the erle of Morteyn̄ beynge thā at Calays, made a vyage into Flaundres, and skyrmysshed with them ye bordred vpon Pycardy, and slewe of them ouer. CCCC, and gate a great droue of beestes, and brought them vnto Calays. And for that certaynte was had that Phylyp duke of Burgoyn entēded to lay his syege aboute Calays / therfore London and all the good townes of Englāde were charged to sende thyder certayne men wel and suffycyently for the warre apparayled. wherof London sente at theyr charge men.
                     Than vpon the .ix. daye of Iuyll / the duke of Burgoyn with a great multytude of Burgonyons and Flemynges appered before Calays,Calys besyeged. and there pyght his pauylyons and tentes / so that euery towne of Flaūdres had theyr tentes by themselfe. At whiche season was Lyeutenaunt of Calays syr Iohn̄ Ratclyf knyght, &amp; of the castell was lieutenaunte the baron of Dudley. And so that syege endured vpon .iii. wekes. In whiche seson many knyghtly actes were done and exercysed vpon bothe partyes, whiche for lengthynge of the tyme I passe. Than vpon the seconde day of August, the duke of Glouceter &amp; protectour of Englāde with a company of .v.C. sayles as some writers haue, landed at Calays / and entended vpon the thyrde day folowynge to haue yssued out of the towne, and to haue gyuen batayll to ye Flemynges. But as testyfyeth all Englysshe wryters / so soone as ye duke of Burgoyn was ware of the great power of the lorde protectour, he toke with hym of his ordenaūce that he myght lyghtly cary / and the other that were heuy and combrous, he lefte behynde hym. Amonge the whiche one was lefte before Guynes a great gunne of brasse named Dygon, ouer dyuers serpentynes and other great gunnes. And the Flemynges lefte behynde them a great quantyte of bere, besyde wyne and floure and other vytayle.
                     But of this vyage wryteth otherwyse Gaguyne / &amp; sayth that ye duke well and manfully, as a valyaunte knyght ī his actes, cōtinued his syge

before Calays ouer two monethes / And there dyd many noble actes in assaylyng of his enemyes. And after ye Flemynges by reason of theyr murmure and rebellion had refused hym, and in maner lafte hym almost with out company / yet not withstādynge he dayly assayled his enemyes / and after with suche small company as was laft hym, whā he sawe he myght not preuayle he returned into his coū
                        tre. And so thus alway in all the sayd Gagwynus boke, he wypeth from ye Englysshemen in all that he may the honoure / and excuseth theyr enemyes to his power. whan the duke with his host was thus fledde / the lorde protectoure with his people folowed hym into the countre by the space of. xi. dayes. In whiche season he brent but two townes / whiche were named and yet be, Poperynge and Bell / and returned to Calays &amp; after into Englande.
                     And this yere was the castell or towne of Rokkesborouth in Scotlande besyeged of the kynge of Scottes. But so soone as he had wyttyng that syr Rauffe Gray knyght was comynge with a competent nombre for to remoue that siege / anone he departed, leuynge some parte of his ordenaunce behynde hym / to his great dyshonoure.

                        sayle Eugeny the .iiii. was deposed / &amp; Amedeus a duke and prynce of Sauoy, was chosen for pope in the place of the forenamed Eugeny. But yet he had suche ayde, that he contynued in Rome as pope all his lyues tyme. And that other whiche was named of his ayders Felix the .v, contynued his dygnyte in other places / so that thā arose a great scisme in ye churche, whether of these .ii. was indubitat pope. For some countrees vphelde ye one and some that other / so that therwere alowed none of them both / and that was called ye neutralytie. This scysine contynued vpon .ix. yeres, the terme whyle Eugeny lyued. After whose dethe was chosen a cardynall named Thomas Sarazan / and after was named Nycholas the .v. To whome the sayde Felix after that he was admitted for Peters successour, of his owne good mynde renounced his dygnyte of papacy / and submytted hym to the rule and obedyence of thē sayd .v.

This Felix was a deuoute prynce &amp; sawe the sones of his sones / and after lyued a deuoute and holi lyfe, and lastly was chosen pope as before is shewed / for the which he is of dyuers wryters accompted for happy. But and he hadde not medled with the tytle of the churche, and therwith blotted his olde age / he had after the opynyon of other wryters, be named or alowed moche more blessed &amp; happy. And this yere in the moneth of August in Lōdon, were two bawdes punysshed with werynge of ray hodes / &amp; after .xl. dayes enprysonment, they were banysshed the towne and dryuen out with most shame.
                     In this yere also the conduyte in Fletestrete was begonne by syr wyllyam Estfelde knyghte and late mayre / and so fynysshed of his good disposicion without cost or charge to the cytie. And he with syr Lewes and Iohan of Estsex were made knyghtes of the Bathe in the same yere.
                     And in this yere dyed Robert Chicheley grocer &amp; twyes mayre of London / the whiche wylled in his testament, that vpon his mynde daye a good and competent dyner shulde be ordeyned for .xxiiii.C. poore mē / and that of houssholders of the cytye yf they myght be foūde. And ouer that was .xx.li. destrybuted amōge them / whiche was to euery man two pens.

For after thys day the fortune of the worlde beganne to fal from ye kyng, so that he loste hys frendes in Englande and hys reuenewes in Fraūce. For shortly after all was ruled by the quene and her counsayl / to the great dysprofyte of the kyng &amp; hys realme / and to the greate maugre and obloquy of the quene.
                     The whych as syn that tyme hath ben well prouyd, had many a wrong and false reporte made of her, whych were to longe to reherse.

                     THys .xxv. yere, was a parlyament holdē at saynt Edmondes Bury in Suffolke. To ye whiche towne all the cōmons of that coūtre were warned to come in theyr moste defēcyble aray, to gyue attendaunce vpō the kyng. And so soone as thys parlyamēt was begō, and the lordes assembled / syr Hūfrey duke of Glouceter and vncle vnto ye kyng, shortly after was arrested by the vycounte Beawmōde thā hygh cōstable of Englande / whome accompanied ye duke of Bukkynghm̄ &amp; other. And after this arest was executed / all his owne seruaūtes were put from him / &amp; .xxxii of the pryncypall of theym were also put vnder arest, &amp; sente vnto dyuers prysons / whereof arose a great murmour amonge the people.
                     Than thus cōtynuyng thys parlyament, wythin .vi. dayes after the duke was arrested, he was founde dede in hys bedde beynge the .xxiiii. daye of February. Of whose murdre dyuers reportes at made, whyche I passe ouer.
                     Than hys corps was layd opyn yt all mē myght se hym, but no wonde was founde on hym. Of the honourable fame of thys man, a longe style I myght make, of ye good rule that he kepte thys lande in, durynge the none age of the kynge / and of hys honourable housholde &amp; libertye which passed all other before hys tyme / and trewe of hys allegeaunce that no mā coude with ryght accuse hī, but malycyous persones whych hys glorious honour &amp; fame lafte nat to maligne agayne hym, tyll he were put frome all wordly rule / and specyally for it was thought, that durynge hys lyfe he wolde withstāde the delyuery of Angeou &amp; Mayne before promysed. Thys for hys honourable and lyberall demeanure was surnamed the good duke of Glouceter. Than after he had lyen opyn a season yt all men myghte be assured of hys dethe / the corps was honourably prouided for and so cōueyed vnto saynt Albonys, &amp; there buryed nere vnto the shryne of saynt Albone / to whose soule god be mercyfull Amen.
                     And whan this noble prynce was thus enteryd / fyue persones of hys housholde, that is to saye, syr Roger Chamberlayne knyght, Myddelton Herbarde, &amp; Arthur esquyers, &amp; one Rycharde Nedā yeman, were sente vnto Londō / &amp; there arayned and iuged to be drawē, hāged, and quartered. Of the whych sentēce drawynge &amp; hāgynge were put in execuciō. But whā they were cut downe to be quartered / ye Marquys of Suffolke there beyng presēt, shewed ye kynges chartour for thē / &amp; so were deliuered to the great reioysyng of ye multytude of ye people there beyng present. But for thys the grudge &amp; murmour of ye people ceased nat agayne the Marquys of Suffolke, for the deth of the good duke of Glouceter / of whose murdre he was specyally suspected.

                        IN thys .xxvi. yere after concordaūce of moste wryters or nere there about / ye .xxiii. scisme of ye church ceased, that before had cōtynued betwene Eugeny the .iiii. &amp; Felix the .v. vpon .xvi. yeres.
                     Thys scisme as before is touched, began by reason of the deposycyō of the sayde Eugeny at the coūsayll of Basile, for that that he wolde nat obserue the decrees before made in the coūsayll of Cōstaūce, &amp; other causes to hym layde. But yet that deposyng natwythstandynge / perforce he cōtynued pope by the terme of .xiiii. yeres after. And the sayde Felix at the sayd coūsayll admitted in lyke maner, cō
                        tynued as pope by all that sayde season / lyke as before to you I haue shewed in the .xvii. yere of thys kynge. And as now by exortacyon of crysten prynces, as the kynge of England, whose messangers in ye behalfe were the bysshoppe of Norwyche, and the lord of saint Iohn̄s, &amp; other princes / the sayd pope Felix to sette a perfyte vnyon in the churche, in thys yere of hys owne volūte resigned hys auctorytie of papacy, and submytted hym vnto the obediēce of Nicholas the .v. of that name / nat wythstandynge that the sayde Felix was a man of great byrthe, &amp; allied to the more partye of all crysten prynces. And thys Nycholas a mā of lowe byrthe, &amp; of vnknowē kynred wythin the cytie of Ieane.
                     Than was Felix made legate of Fraunce &amp; cardynal of Sauoye / and lyued after a blessed &amp; holy lyfe &amp; so ended. And as some wryters testifye, god for hym hath shewed dyuers miracles syns he dyed. And for thys scysme thus gracyously was ended / a vercyfyer made thys verse folowynge.

                           ¶Lux fussit mundo, cessit Felix Nicholao.
                        
                     
                     The whych verse is thus to meane in Englyshe.

                           ¶Lyght into the worlde now dothe sprynge and shyne.
                           ¶For Felix vnto Nicholas all frely doth resyne.
                        
                     
                     Also as testifieth Gaguyne &amp; also some englyshe wryters, yt trewys betwene Englād &amp; Fraūce cōtynuyng / a knyght of ye Englysh partie named syr Fraūceys Arrogonoyse, toke a town vpō the borders of Normādy belōgyng vnto ye duke of Brytayne. For yt which he cōplayned hym vnto Charles the Frēch kyng / &amp; he at the sayd dukes request sent vnto ye kyng of Englād Iohn̄ Hanart &amp; Guyllm̄ Cōsynot knyghtes, to axe restitucyō of ye harme. The whych were answered of ye kynges coūsayll, yt the dede was ryght displeasaūt vnto ye kyng / &amp; that ye sayd syr Fraūceys had enter prysed ye fayt of his owne presūpcion &amp; nothyng wyth the kyngꝭ mynde or plesure. Thā after this answere thus made / it was agreed by the duke of Somerset thā lieutenaūt vnder the kyng in Normādy, yt a comynycaciō for thy

                         matyer shulde be hadde at a towne named Louers. To the which place at the day assygned apperyd &amp; came certayne persones for both partyes / where they so beyng occupyed, a trayne was cōpassed by the French mē to take frō ye Englyshmen a strōg town or hold named Poūt all Arche, wherof the maner was thys.
                     A Frenche man or Norman beynge a carter, whyche dayly vsed to entre thys towne wyth vytayll and other lodynge of hys carte / seynge the neglygence of the Engglysshemen, howe lyttel hede they toke vnto the watche of the towne, warned a Frenche capytayne named Floquet / annd sayde that wyth lytell helpe that town wolde be goten. For expedycyō wherof, thys Floquet

wyth other couenaunted wyth the sayd carter to bryng about theyr purpose / &amp; ordeyned vnto hym .ii. hardy sowdyours of Frenchemē, whyche bare in theyr neckes .ii. carpēter axes to shewe that they were carpenters. And after agremēt made among thē, how they shuld entre into the towne, &amp; where they shulde mete the carter, whych after hys olde custome entred the gates wythout susspycyon / and soone after wyth his axe in his necke came by one sowdyour, &amp; in a whyle after that other / &amp; so wyth lytell questyonyng to them made, passed ye gates / and so lastly vnto the house of ye carter before appoynted, &amp; there kept them secrete tyll nyght was commyn knowynge well that the hoste of the hous was enemy to Englysshemen, for an iniury to hym of an Englysshe man before done, &amp; shewed to hym all theyr counsayll. The whyche promysed to them all the assystence &amp; ayde that he myght make. In thys nyghtes passe tyme for the fortheraunce of thys purpose / the lord of Bressy with a chosen company of knyghtes lodged hym in a busshemēt nere vnto ye towne towarde the gate of saint Andrewe / &amp; the forenamed Floquet lodged hym wyth an other chosen company vnder the parte of the towne whych is toward Louers, beīg with hym syr Iamys de Cleremont and other men of name. These ordenaunces &amp; prouysyons thus ordeyned for / the forenamed carter with his .ii. sowdyours forenamed in the sprynge of the mornynge, as in the moneth of Octobre, came erely vnto ye gatewith hys carte, &amp; called the porter by name in fayre maner to opyn ye gate, &amp; promysed to hym a rewarde for hys labour. The porter knowyng well the carter, &amp; takyng lytell regarde to the other .ii. whyche came with hym / opened the gate, and sent an other felow of hys to opyn the former gate. whan the fryste was opened / the carter set hys carte in the selfe gate, &amp; drewe to hys purs to gyue to the porter hys reward before ꝓmysed. And as he tolde the money into hys hād / of a falshode he let part of the money fall vpon the groūde. The whych whyle the porter stouped to take vp / the carter wyth his dagger or other wepyn gaue such a stroke vnto ye porter, yt he ne spake nor cryed after. And so soone as this myschyefe was don / so soon was the other porter slayn of ye .ii. sowdiours. And y• done, one of thē rā forth of ye gates &amp; gaue a sygne vnto the lorde of Bressy / whyche forthwith entred the towne, &amp; toke &amp; slewe all suche as to them made resystēce / &amp; wāne in short whyle ye castell as the towne, &amp; slewe therin moche people, and toke many prysoners. Amonge the whyche as sayeth Gagwyne, the lorde Facounbrydge as capytayne of that towne was there taken prysoner. whan this towne was thus won by the cautele of the Frenchemē, &amp; the terme of the trewis was nat yet expyred / thā was labour made vnto the French kynge for restytucyon of thys towne and other wronges done in wynnyng of ye same. To the whyche it was answered, that yf the Englysshemen wolde restore the towne of Fogyers wyth other harmys there done / that than the Frenchemen shulde restore thys towne wyth the other harmys. For treaty wherof a daye of metyng was apoynted at a place called Boūport / where the tyme was spente in vayne of bothe partyes / so that of ye metyng came none effecte.
                     Of the takynge of thys sayde towne of Fogyers ensuyed moche harme to the Englysshmen / for this was the occasyon, by the whyche the Frenchemen after gatte all Normandy.

                        mynge from the Baye beynge ladyn wyth salte / the which were of Pruce, Holande, and zeland, &amp; other parties of Flaunders / and so broughte them to Hampton̄, and there made hys porte sale▪ For the whyche pryse the marchauntes goodes of Englād were arested in dyuers places of flaū
                        ders / as Bruges, Ipre, &amp; other good townes / and myghte nat haue the sayd goodes deliuered, tyll they had takē appoyntemēt for to paye for the sayd prise &amp; theyr hurtes &amp; damages.
                     And contynuyng the foresayd parlyamēte / the duke of Suffolke was arested, &amp; sent as prysoner to content some myndes vnto the towre / where he was kept at hys plesure a moneth &amp; after delyuered at large / the which dyscontented many mēnes myndes. For to hym was layde the charge of the delyuery of Angeou &amp; Mayne, &amp; the deth of that noble prynce Humfrey duke of Glouceter. Than of thys grudge ensued rebellyon of the cōmons, in so moche that they assembled theym in sondry places, &amp; made of them selfe capytaynes, and named them Blewe berde and other counter fayte names / and so entēded to haue gadered more company. But anone as the kynges counsayll was thereof warnyd, they were layde for, and taken, and putte to dethe.
                     Thanne the foresayde parlyamente was adiourned vnto Leyceter / whether came the kynge and wyth hym the duke of Suffolke. Than the commons of the common hous made requeste to the kyng, that all suche persones as were consentynge and laboured for the gyuynge ouer the duchye of Angeou and erledome

of Mayn̄, myght be punisshed. Of whiche offēce to be gyltie / they accused the foresayd duke of Suffolke, the lorde Sey, the bysshop of Salysbury, and one Danyell a gentylman, with Treuylyan &amp; other. Than to appease the cōmon hous / the duke was exyled for .v. yeres, and the lord Sey as tresorer of Englande / and ye other were put a parte for a whyle, &amp; were promysed to be sent vnto the kynges gayoll or warde.
                     Than the duke in obeynge ye sentence foresayde, sped hym towarde ye sees syde in the moneth of Apryl, and toke his shyppynge in Northfolke, entēding to haue sayled into Fraūce. In kepyng of whiche course / he was mette with a shyppe of warre named Nicholas of the Tower, the whiche toke his shyp. And whā ye capytayne was ware of the duke / anone he toke hym into his owne shyp, and so kept his course towarde Douer. And whā he was comen vnto the rode / anone he caused hym to be confessed of his owne chaplayne / and that done shypmē put hym in a shypbote, and there vpon the syde of the bote, one strake of his hed. whiche hed with the body was soone after conueyed to the lāde of Douer, and there lefte vpon ye sandes / and the sayd shypmen returned to the see agayne. And thus one myschefe ensued vpon an other, to the dystruccyon of the nobles of this lāde. And so vpon the fyrst daye of May, was this deed corps foūde vpon Douer sandes, and after conueyed to his restynge place to This yere also beynge the yere of our lordes in carnacyon .xiiii.C. and .l. was the Iubile or the plenary pardon at Rome, whiche of Englysshmen is called the yere of grace.
                     And this yere a towne in Normā
                        dy named Uernoyll, was taken by ye treason of a Frenche baker / the maner wherof were lōge to wryte. But fynally it came to ye possession of Floquet before rehersed, to the great dystruccyon of Englysshmen. For now was ye trewes ended, &amp; mortal warre was executed vpon both ꝑtyes / &amp; the Englysshmē vnto ye Frēche wrought moche myschyef dyuers wayes, whiche were lōge to wryte. But as to fore I haue shewed to you sondry tymes / the most losse turned euer last warde vpon ye Englyssh ꝑtie. For this seasō also were ye townes of Nogēt &amp; poūt Andenere wonne by the erle of saynt Paule &amp; other. And in ye moneth of Iuny this yere,Insurrecciō in Kent. ye cōmons of Kent assēbled thē in great multitude, &amp; chase to them a capitayee, and named hym Mortymer and cosyn of the duke of york / but of most he was named Iak Cade. This kept ye people wonderously togyder / &amp; made suche ordenaū
                        ces amonge thē, yt he brought a great nōbre of people of thē vnto ye Blak hethe. where he deuysed a byll of peticiōs to ye kyng &amp; ye coūsayll / &amp; shewed them what iniuryes &amp; oppressiōs the poore cōmōs suffred, by suche as were aboute ye kynge a fewe ꝑsones in nōbre, &amp; all vnder coloure to come to his aboue. The kynges coūsayll seynge this byll, dysalowed it, &amp; coūsayled the kynge, whiche by the .vii. day of Iuny had gathered to hī a strōge hoste of people, to go agayne his rebelles, &amp; to gyue vnto them batayll. Than the kynge, after the sayd rebelles had holdē theyr felde vpon blak hethe .vii. dayes / made towarde thē. wherof heryng the capytayne, drewe backe with his people to a vyllage called Seuenok, &amp; there enbatayled▪ thē. Thā it was agreed by ye kynges counsayll, that syr Humfrey Stafforde knyght, with wyllyam his brother, and other certayne gentylmen, shulde folowe the chase / and the kyng with his lordes shuld retourne

vnto Grenewyche, wenynge to them that the rebelles were fledde &amp; gone. But as before I have shewed, whan syr Humfray with his cōpany drewe nere vnto Seuenok / he was wared of ye capytayne that there abode with his people. And whan he had counsayledde with the other gentylmen / lyke a manfull knyghte set vpon the rebelles, and fought with them lōge. But in the ende the capytayne slewe hym &amp; his brother with many other, and caused the rest to gyue backe. Al whiche season the kynges hoste laye styll vpon Blakhethe, beyng amōge them sondry opinions / so that some and many fauoured the capytayne. But fynally whan worde came of ye ouerthrowe of the Staffordes / they sayd playnly and boldly, that excepte the lorde Saye and other before rehersed were cōmytted to warde, they wolde take the capytaynes partye. For the appeasynge of the whiche rumour, the lorde Saye was put into ye tower / but that other as thā were not at hande. Thanne the kynge hauynge knowlege of the scomfyture of his men, and also of the rumour of his ostynge people / remoued frome Grenewyche to London / and there with his hoste rested hym a whyle.
                     And so soone as Iak Cade hadde thus ouercomen the Stafforde / he anone apparayled hi with ye knyghtes apparayll, and dyd on hym his bryganders set with gylte nayle and his salet and gylte spores. And after he had refresshed his people, he returned agayne to Blakhethe / and there pyght agayne his feld as here tofore he had done / and laye there from the nyne &amp; twenty daye of Iuny beynge saynte Peters daye, tyll the fyrste day of Iuly. In whiche season came vnto hym the archebysshop of Cantorbury and the duke of Bukkyngham / with whome they had longe cō
                        munycacyon, and fonde hym ryghte dyscrete in his answeres. How be it they coude not cause hi to lay downe his people, and to submyt hym vnto the kynges grace.
                     In this whyle the kynge and the quene herynge of the encreasynge of his rebelles, and also the lordes ferynge theyr owne seruaūtes lest they wolde take the capytaynes partie, remoued frome London to Kyllyngworth / leuynge ye cyte without ayde, excepte onely the lorde Scales / whiche was lefte to kepe the tower, and with hym a manly &amp; warly man named Mathewe Fowth. Than the capytayne of Kente thus houynge at Blakhethe / to the ende to blynde the more the people, and so brynge hym in fame that he kepte good iustyce, be heded there a pety capytayne of his named Parys / for so moch as he had offended agayne suche ordynaūce as he had stablysshed in his hoste / &amp; herynge yt the kynge and all his lordes were thus departed, drewe hym nere vnto ye cytie. So that vpon the fyrste day of Iuly, he entred the bourgh of Southwarke, beynge than wednesday / &amp; lodged hym there that nyght, for he myght not be suffered to entre the cytie.
                     And vpon the same day, the commōs of Essex in great nombre pyght theym a felde vpon the playne at myles ende. And vpon the seconde daye of the sayd moneth, the mayre called a common counsayle at the Gyldhall, for to puruey the withstandynge of these rebelles and other matyers. In whiche assemble were dyuers opinions / so that some thought good that the sayde rebelles shulde be receyued into the cytie, and some otherwyse. Amonge the whiche, Roberte Horne stok fysshmonger than beynge an alderman, spake sore agayne them that wolde haue them entre. For y• whiche

sayenges, the cōmons were so amoued agayn hym, that they ceased not tyll they had hym cōmytte to warde.
                     And the same afternoone aboute v. of the clok, the capytayne with his people entred by ye brydge. And whā he came vpon the drawe brydge / he hewe the ropes yt drewe the brydge in sondre with his swerde, and so passed into ye cytie / and made in sondry places therof proclamacyons in the kynges name, that no man in peyne of dethe shulde robbe or take ony thyng parforce without payeng therfore. By reason wherof he wanne many hertes of the cōmons of the cytie / but all was done to begyle with the people, as after shall euydently appere. For he rode thorough dyuers stretes of the cytie / and as he came by London stone, he strake it with his swerde, and sayd now is Mortymer lorde of this cytie. And whan he had thus shewed hymselfe in dyuers places of the cytie, &amp; shewed his mynde to ye mayre for ye ordrynge of his people / he returned into Southwarke, and there abode as he before hadde done, his people cōmynge &amp; goynge at lawfull houres whan they wolde. Than vpon the morne beynge the thyrde daye of Iuly and frydaye / the sayd capytayne entred agayne the cytie, and caused the lorde Sey to be fet frome the tower and ladde vnto the Guyldhall / where he was areygned before the mayre &amp; other of ye kynges iustyce. In whiche passe tyme he entended to haue brought before ye sayd iustyces the foresayd Robert Horne. But his wyfe and frendes made to hym suche instaūt labour, that fynally for .v.C. marke he was set at his lybertye. Than the lorde Sey beynge as before is sayde at Guyldhall, desyred yt he myght be iudged by his peers. wherof herynge the capytayne, sent a company of his vnto the hall / the whiche parforce toke hym from the offycers, and so brought hym vnto the standarde in the Chepe / where or he were halfe shryuen they strake of his hed / &amp; yt done pyght it on a lōg pole, &amp; so bare it aboute with them.
                     In this tyme and season had the capytayne caused a gentylman to be taken named Cromer, whiche before had ben shyreffe of Kent, and vsed as they sayde some extorcyons. For which cause, or for he had fauoured the lorde Sey, by reason that he had maried his doughter / he was haryed to Myles ende, and there in ye capitaynes presence byheded. And ye same tyme was ther also byheded a man called Baylly / ye cause of whose dethe was this as I haue herd some men reporte. This Baylly was of ye famylyer and olde acqueyntaunce of Iak Cade. wherfore so soone as he espyed hym cōmynge to hym warde, he cast in his mynde that he wolde dyscouer his lyuyng &amp; olde maners, and shewe of his vyle kynne and lynage. wherfore knowynge yt the sayd Baylly vsed to vere scrowes and prophecyes aboute hym, shewyng to his cōpany yt he was an enchaunter and of yll dysposycion, and yt they shulde well knowe by such bokes as he bare vpon hym / and bad them serche, and yf they founde not as he sayde, yt thā they shuld put hym to dethe / whiche all was doone accordynge to his cō
                        maundment. whan they had thus be heded these .ii. men / they toke the hede of Croumer &amp; pyght it vpon a pole / and so entred the cytie with the hedes of the lorde Sey and of Croumer. And as they passed the stretes / they ioyned the poles togyder, &amp; caused eyther deed mouthe to kysse other dyuers and many tymes.
                     And the capytayne the selfe same daye wente vnto the house of Phylyppe Malpas draper and

and alderman / and robbeb and spoyled his house, and toke thens a great substaunce. But he was before warned, and therby conueyed moche of his money and plate, or elles he had ben vndone. At whiche spoylynge were present many poore men of the cytie, whiche at suche tymes ben euer redy in all places to do harme, where suche ryottes ben doone.
                     Thā towarde nyght, he returned into Southwarke / &amp; vpon ye morne reentred ye cytie, and dyned that daye at a place ī saynt Margaret Patyns parysshe called Gherstys hous. And whan he had dyned / lyke an vncurteyse gest he robbed hym as the daye before he had Malpas. For which .ii. robberyes, all be it that the porayll &amp; nedy people drewe vnto hym, &amp; were partyners of that yll / the honest and thryfty comoners cast in theyr myndes the sequele of this matyer, and fered leste they shulde be delte with in lyke maner / by meane wherof he lost the peoples fauour and hertes. For it was to be thought, yf he had not executed that robbery, he myghte haue gone ferre, and brought his purpose to good effecte, yf he hadde entended well. But it is to deme and presuppose, that the entent of hym was not good / wherfore it myght not come to ony good conclusyon. Than ye mayre and aldermen with assystence of the worshypfull comeners, seynge this mysdeanour of ye capytayne / in sauegardynge of themselfe and of the cytye, toke theyr counsayles how they myght dryue the capytayne and his adherētes from ye cytie, wherin theyr feare was the more, for so moche as the kynge and his lordes with theyr powers were farre from theym. But yet in aduoydynge of apparēt peryl / they condyscended, that they wolde withstande his any more entre into the cytie. For the performaūce wher of ye mayre sent vnto the lorde Scales and Mathewe Gowgth than hauynge the tower in gydynge / &amp; had of them assent to perfourme ye same.
                     Than vpon the .v. day of Iuly ye capytayne beynge in Southwarke, caused a mā to be heded, for cause of his dyspleasure to hym doone as the fame went / &amp; so kepte hym in Southwarke all ye day. How be it he myght haue entred the cytie yf he had wold.
                     And whan nyght was comynge / the mayre and cytezyns with Mathewe Gowth lyke to theyr former appoynmtent kepte the passage of ye brydge beynge sonday, and defended the Kentysshe mē whiche made great force to reenter the cytie. Than the capytayne seynge this bykerynge begon / yode to harneys, and called his people aboute hym / and set so fyersly vpon the cytezyns, that he draue thē backe from ye stulpes ī Southwarke or brydge fote vnto ye drawe brydge. In defendynge wherof, many a man was drowned and slayne. Amonge yt whiche, of men of name was Iohan Sutton aldermā, Mathewe Gouth gentylman, and Roger Heysande cytezyn. And thus contynued this skyrmysshe all nyght tyll .ix. of the clocke vpon the morne / so that somtyme the cytezyns had the better / &amp; thus soone the Kentysmen were vpon the better syde. But euer they kepte them vpon the brydge / so that the cytezyns passed neuer moche the bulwarke at the byrdge fote, nor ye Kentysshmē moche ferther thā the drawe brydge. Thus cōtynuyng the cruel fyght to the dystruccyon of moche people on bothe sydes / lastly after the Kentysshmen were put to the worse, a trewe was agreed for certayne houres. Duryng the whiche trewe, the archebysshop of Cantorbury than chaunceler of Englande, sent a generall pardon to the capytayne for hymselfe, and an

other of hys peple. By reason wherof he &amp; hys company departed the same nyght out of Southwarke / &amp; so retourned euery man to hys owne.
                     
                        Thende of Iacke Cade. But it was nat longe after that the capytayne wyth hys cōpany was thus departed, that proclamacyons were made in dyuers places of Kent, of Southsex, and Sowtherey, that who myghte take the foresayde Iak Cade other on lyue or dede, shulde haue a .M. marke for hys trauayle. After whych proclamacion thus publisshed / a gētylmā of Kēt named Alexander Iden̄, awayted so hys tyme that he toke hym in a gardyn in Sussex. where in the takyng of hym the sayd Iak was slayne / &amp; so beynge dede, was brought into Southwarke the daye of the moneth of &amp; there left in the kynges benche for that nyght. And vpon y• morowe the dede corps was drawen thorugh the hyghe stretes of the cytye vnto New gate, &amp; there heded and quartered. whose hede was than sent to Londō brydge / &amp; his .iiii. quarters were sent to .iiii sondry townes of Kent.
                     And thys done / the kyng sent hys commissions into Kent, &amp; rode after hym selfe / and caused enquery to be made of thys riot in Caunterbury / where for the same .viii. men were iuged &amp; put to deth. And in other good townes of Kent &amp; Southsex, dyuers other were put in execucyon for the same ryot.
                     In thys yere also, in the west coū
                        tree was slayne the bisshop of Salysbury by the commons of that coūtre.Byshop of Salysbury s

                           ayne. wherfore after the kyng had sped his besynesse in Kent &amp; Sussex, he rode thyder to se also those malefactours punysshed.

                     IN thys .xxix. yere vpō sait Leonardes daye or the .vi. daye of Nouembre, began the parlyamente at westmynster. And the fyrste day of Decēbre folowyng / the duke of Somerset whyche newly was commyn out of Normandy, was putte vnder arest / and his goodes by the cōmons were fowly dyspoyled &amp; borne a waye out of the blak fryers. For at this season was moche people in the cytie by reason of the parlyament / &amp; specially of lordes seruauntes, whyche were awaytynge vppon theyr lordes and maysters in great multytude. For ye shall vnderstande, ye temporall lordꝭ in those dayes kepte other maner of housholdes &amp; other maner of reteyndour of housholde seruauntes and other nombre, ferre excedynge that the lordes at these dayes done. wherefore at parlyament tymes and other great counsayles / the cytyes or townes where they assembled, were hougely stuffed wyth people. Than after thys ryot thys commytted / vpon the morowe folowynge proclamacyon was made thorugh the cytye, that no man shulde spoyle or robbe vppon payne of dethe. And the same day at the stādarde in Chepe, was a mā beheded for brekyng of the sayd proclamaciō. And thus begō rumour &amp; malyce to spryng betwene ye lordꝭ of the lāde. And specially ye duke of Somerset &amp; other of ye quenes coūsayll were had ī great hatered, for ye losīg of Normādy / wherof ye chief citie of Roā was lost or gyue vp by apointemēt ye yere precedyng, as witnesseth Gaguynus

vpon cōdycyon that the duke of Somerset with his wyfe and Englyssh sowyours, shulde with suche goodes as they myghte cary, departe frely from ye cytie. For whiche fre passage he shulde pay vnto ye Frenche kynge lvi.M. scutes which amoūte to .xiiii.M. marke sterlyng. And also he was bounde to delyuer into the Frenche kynges possession, all townes and castelles that at that daye were in the possessyon of Englysshemen within the duchy of Normandy. For performaunce of whiche couenauntes, the lorde Talbot was set for one of the pledges / and so by one Floquet before named all the sayd townes and castelles were by hym to the Frenche kynges vse receyued / Harflete onely excepted. wherof ye capytayne named Cyrson or Curson denyed the delyuery / with assystence of one named syr Thomas Auryngham. The whiche in despyte of all the Frenche kynges power layde bothe by see and lande, helde it from the begynnynge of Decembre tyll the moneth of Ianuary / and than for lacke of rescouse gaue it vp by appoynment in ye begynnynge of this mayres yere. For this yeldynge vp of Normandy, moche dyspleasure grewe vnto the quene and her counceyll / in so moche yt the duke of yorke father vnto kyng Edwarde the .iiii. with many lordes with hym allyed, toke partye agayne hyr and her counsayll / so that mortall warre therof ensued as here after in this story wall appere.

                     IN thys .xxx. yere &amp; .xvi. daye of February / the kynge beyng accompanied with the duke of Somersette and many other lordes, toke theyr iournay towarde the marchys of walys / for so moche as he was credibly assertayned, yt the duke of york assysted with dyuers other lordes &amp; mē of name, had in those partyes gathered great strengthe of people, and with them was entrynge the lande / and so helde on his iourney towarde hym. But whan ye duke had wytyng of the kynges great power / he swaued the way from the kynges hoste, and toke the way towarde London. And for he had receyued knowlege from the cytie, yt he myght not there be receyued to refresshe hym and his people / he therwith went ouer Kyngstone brydge and so into Kente / and there vpon an hethe called Brente heth, he pyght his felde. wherof the kynge houynge knowlege, sped hym after / and lastly came vnto Blacke hethe &amp; there pyght his felde. where bothe hostes beynge thus enbatayled / meidaciō was made of peace by twene both hostes, For furtheraunce wherof / to the duke were sente ye bysshoppes of wynchester and of Ely, with the erles of Salysbury and of warwyke. To whome it was answered by the sayd duke, yt he nor none of the company entended none hurte vnto the kynges persone, nor to any of his counsayll beynge louers of ye cōmon weale and of hym and of his lande / but his entēt &amp; purpose was, to remoue from hym a fewe euyll disposed persones, by whose meanes ye cōmon people was greuously opressed, and the comynaltye greatly enpouerysshed. Of y• whiche he named

for principall the duke of Somerset. Of whome it was fynally agreed by the kyng▪ that he shulde be cōmytted to warde, there to abyde &amp; answere vnto suche artycles as the duke of yorke wolde lay agayne hym.

In whyche tyme the duke of yorke was sent for thyther by pryuey seale, with also the erle of Salesbury &amp; the erle of warwyke / where by couyne of the quene they were all .iii. in great daunger. Howe be it by monys shemēt of theyr frendes they escaped. And soone after the sayd duke or erle went into the Northe / and the erle of warwyke wyth a goodly companye sayled vnto Calays. And shortly after were taken at Eryth wythin .xii. myles of London .iiii, wōderfull fysshys / whereof one was called Mors Maryne, the secōde a Sword fisshe, &amp; the other .ii. were whalys / whyche after some exposytours were pronostycacyons of warre &amp; trouble to ensue soon after. In this yere also was a great fray in the Northe countrey, betwene the lord Egremōde and the sonnes of the erle of Salysbury / and diuers mē maymed &amp; slayen betwene them. But in the ende the lord Egremonde was taken / &amp; howe it was by the dome of the kynges counsayll or otherwyse, the sayd lorde Egremōde was founden in suche defaute, that fynally he was condempned in great summes of money to be payed vnto the sayd erle of Salysbury. For lack of payment whereof, or of puttynge suertye for the same / the sayde lorde

Egremonde was cōmytted to Newgyte. where after he had contynued a certayne of tyme, he brake the prysone and escapyd with thre other prysoners, to the greate charge of the sheryffes.
                     It was not longe after that dyscencyon &amp; vnkyndnesse fell bytwene the yonge duke of Somerset and syr Iohn̄ Neuyll sonne vnto the erle of Salysbury, beynge than bothe lodged wythin the cytye. wherof the mayre beyng warned ordeyned such watches and prouysyōs, that yf they had any thynge styrred, he was able to haue subdued bothe partyes, and to haue put thē in warde tyll he had knowē the kynges farther pleasure. wherof the frendes of bothe partyes beynge ware / laboured such meanes that they agreed them for that tyme.
                     In thys also as testyfye the Englyshe cronycle and also the French / a nauye or flote of Frenchemen landyd at Sandwyche, and spoyled and robbed the towne, &amp; excercysed there greate crueltye. Of whych flote was capytayne a Frenche knyght named after the French boke syr Guyllyain de Pomyers. And thys yere after the opynyon of dyuers wryters / began in a cytye of Almayne named Magounce, the crafte of enprentynge of bokes / whyche sen that tyme hath had wonderfull encreace, as experyence at thys daye proueth. In this yere also the prysoners of Newgate by neglygence of theyr kepers brake out of theyr wardes, and toke the ledys of the towre, and it defendyd a longe whyle agayne the sheryffes &amp; all theyr offycers / in so myche that they were forced to call more ayde of the cytesyns of the cytye / by whose ayde they lastly subdued them, and put ye sayd prysoners in more streyghter kepyng. Cronica cronicarū sayth that about thys tyme was suche an erthquake in ye prouynce of Naples, that byforce therof there were perysshed ouer .xl.M. crysten soulys. Of the abouesayde spoylynge of Sandwyche speketh Polycronycon / and sayeth that syr Pyers de Bresy senes shall of Normandy, wyth the capytayne of Depe and many other capytaynes of Fraunce, came wyth a greate &amp; stronge nauy into the Downys by nyght / and vpon the morowe came certeyne of them vnto Sandwych, and there spoyled and robbed the towne, and toke with them great prayes and many ryche prysoners / wherby or by whych sayenge appereth some dyuersyte bytwene the Englysshe wryters and the Frenche.

In obeynge of which commaundement, the duke of yorke came vnto London the .xxvi. daye of

By reason whereof, good ordre and rule was kepte, and no man so hardy ones to attempte the brekynge of the kynges peace. Durynge thys watche, a great counsayl was holdē by ye kyng and hys lordes.
                     By reason wherof, a dyssymuled vnyte and concorde betwene them was concluded. In token and for ioy wherof, the king, the quene, and all ye sayd lordes, vpon out Lady day annuciacion in lent at Poulys wente solemply in processyon / and soone after euery lorde departed where hys pleasure was. And in the moneth of folowynge, was a greate fray in flete strete, betwene the mē of courte and the inhabytauntes of the sayd strete / in whyche fray a gentylman beyng ye quenes attourney was slayne.
                     Vpon the thursdaye in whytsonweke, the duke of Somerset with Antony Ryuers and other .iiii, kepte iustes of peace before the quene within the towre of London, agayne thre esquyers of the quenes / and in lyke maner at Grenewych the sonday folowynge.

                     But this is full lyke to be vntrew that the Ianuayes shulde spoyle hym for any suche cause / for there is no nacyon in Englande that delyth so lytle wyth spycys. But were it for thys cause or other,

trouth it is that by that nacyō an of fēce was done / for the whyche all the marchauntes Ianuayes in London were arested and cōmytted to ye flete, tyll they had found en suffycyent suer tye to answere to the premysses.

Thanne encreased thys olde malyce more &amp; more / in so moche that where the quene and hyr coūsayll sawe that they myght nat be auenged vppō the erle, that so vnto Calays was departed / than they malygned agayne hys father the erle of Salysbury, &amp; imagened how he myght be brought out of lyfe. And in processe of tyme after, as he was rydynge towarde Salysbury, or after som from hys lodgyng towarde London / the lorde Audeley wyth a strōg company was assygned to mete wyth hym, &amp; as prysoner to bryng hym vnto Londō. whereof the sayde erle beynge warned, gathered vnto hym the mo men / &amp; kepyng hys iourney, mette wyth the sayd lord Audeley at a place called Bloreheth / where both companyes ran together &amp; had there a strōge by keryng. wherof in the ende the erle was vyctoure, and slewe there the lorde Audeley &amp;

many of hys retynew. At thys skyrmys she were the .ii. sonnes of the sayd erle sore woūded, named sir Thomas and syr Iohn̄ / the whyche shortly after as they were goynge homeward, were by some of the quenys party taken, &amp; as prysoners sente vnto Chestry. whan thys was knowen vnto ye duke of yorke and to the other lordes of hys party / they knewe &amp; understode that yf they ꝓuyded nat shortly for remedy for them selfe, they shulde all be destroyed. And for that they by one assent gathered to them a strōge hoste of men, as of Marche men and other / &amp; in the moneth of Octobre, yt was in the begynnyng of the .xxxviii yere of the reygne of kynge Henry, &amp; the later ende of thys mayres yere, they drewe them towarde the kynge / to the entent to remoue frō hym such persones as they thought were enemyes vnto the commō weale of Englande. But the quene and hyr counsayll heryng of the entent &amp; strength of these lordes, caused the kyng in all haste to sende forthe cōmyssyons to gather the people / so that in shorte whyle the kyng was strongely accōpanyed, &amp; so spedde hym vppon hys iourney to warde the duke of yorke &amp; hys company. wherof heryng ye sayd duke, thā beyng wyth hys peple nere vnto the towne of Ludlowe / pyghte there a sure &amp; strōge feelde, that none of hys foes myght vppon any parte entre. where he so lyeng, came to him frome Calays the erle of warwyke wyth a stronge bande of mē / amonge the whyche was Andrewe Trollop and many other of ye best souldiours of Calays. The duke thus kepynge hys feelde vpon that one party, and the kyng wyth hys people vpon that other / vpon the nyght precedyng the daye that bothe hostes shulde haue met / the forenamed Andrewe Trolloppe wyth all the chefe soudyours of Calays, secretly departed frome ye dukes hoste, and wente vnto the kynges, where they were ioyously receyued. whā thys thynge to the duke and the other lordes was asserteyned they were therewhyth sore dysmayed / and specyally for the sayd lordes had to the sayd Andrew shewed the hoole of theyr ententes, whych thanne they knewe well shuld be clerelye dyscouered vnto theyr enemyes. wherfore after coūsayll for a remedye taken / they concluded to flee, &amp; to leue the feelde standyng as they had ben presente and styll abydyng. And so incontynently the sayd duke wyth hys twoo sonnes &amp; a few other persones fledde towarde walys / and from thens passed sauely into Irelande.
                     And the erles of Salysbury, of Marche, &amp; of warwyke, and other, wyth a secrete company also departed and toke the waye into Deuonshyre / where a squyer named Iohan Dynham (whyche after was a lorde and hyghe tresourer of Englande, &amp; so lastlye in Henry the .vii. dayes and xvi. yere of hys reygne dyed) bought a shyp for a .C. &amp; .x. markes or a leuen score nobles / and in the same shyppe the sayd lordes went, &amp; so sayled into Gerneley. And whā they had a seasō there soiourned and refresshed them selfe / they departed thens, as in the begynnyng of the nexte mayres yere shalbe clerely shewed. Uppon the morowe whan all thys couyne was knowen to the kynge and the lordes vpon hys party / there was sendynge and rūnynge wyth all spede towarde euery cooste to take these lordes / but none myght be foūde. And forthwith the kyng rode vnto Ludlowe, &amp; dyspoyled the towne and castell, &amp; sente the duchesse of yorke wyth hyr chyldren vnto the duchesse of Buckynghā hyr syster / where she rested lōge after.

                     THys yere that is to meane vppon the fryday next ensuyng Alhalowen day, after the sayde erles of Salysbury, of Marche, &amp; of warwyke had as before is said refresshed them in the ile of Gernesey / they vpō the fryday foresayd lāded at Calays / and there were at a posterne by theyr frēdes ioyously receyued. Thā anon vpon this these foresayd lordes were proclaymed rebellys &amp; traytours / &amp; the yonge duke of Somerset was made capitayne of Calays. wherfore in all haste he made purueyaunce &amp; saylyd thyther to take possessyon of ye town. But he fayled of hys purpose / for the foresayde erles there beynge, kept so ye towne, that there he myght haue no rule / natwythstandyng that he shewed the kynges letter patētys, wyth many other strayght commaū
                        dementes of the kynge. For whyche cause the sayd duke yode vnto Guynys, and there helde hym for a seasō. And anone as the sayd duke was lā
                        ded / some of the shypmen, which had brought hym thyther, for good wyll that they owed vnto the erle of warwyke cōueyed theyr shippes streyght into Calays hauen, &amp; brought wyth them certayne persones named Genyn Fenbyll, Iohn̄ Felowe, Kayles and Purser, whyche were enemyes vnto the sayde erle of warwyke / the whyche were presented vnto the lordes, and soone after wythin the sayd towne of Calays they were beheded. Thys rumoure thus contynuynge / dayly came vnto these lordes greate socoure out of Englāde. And vppon that other partye the duke as before is sayd lyeng in the castel of Guynes gate vnto hym ayde and strengthe of souldyours, &amp; made out and skyrmysshed wyth them of Calays many and sundry tymes. In whych assautes many mē were slayen &amp; hurte vppon both partyes / but moste wekyd the dukes partye. For all be that the lordes lost many men / yet they dayly came so thycke to them out of dyuers partyes of Englāde, that theyr losse was nat espyed / so that they wantyd no mē, but money to maynteyn̄ theyr dayly charge with. For remedy wher of they shyfted wyth the staple of Calays for .xviii.M.li. whyche summes of money whan they had receyued, ye sayd lordes of one assent made ouer ye forenamed mayster Iohn̄ Dynham wyth a stronge company / &amp; sent hym vnto Sandwyche to wynne ye kynges nauye than there lyenge, and other thynges for theyr nedes necessary. The whyche sped hym in suche wyse, that he toke the lord Ryuers in hys bedde, &amp; wanne the town, &amp; toke the lord Scalys sonne vnto the sayd lord Riuers, with other ryche prayes and after tooke of the kynges nauy what shyppes them lyked, and after retourned vnto Calays / nat without consent &amp; agremēt of many of ye mariners, whych owyd theyr synguler fauours vnto the erle of warwyke. In thys iourney was the sayde Iohan Dynham sore hurt, that he was may med vpon the legge, &amp; haltyd whyle he lyued after. Than after this iourney thus acheuyd / the sayd lordes by tayled and māned the sayd shyppes / &amp; sent wyth them as chefe capytayne the erle of warwyke into Irelande, to speke wyth the duke of yorke, and to haue hys counsayll for maters cō

                        he sayd duke, yf he hadde made any coūtenaunce toward him. But the duke harde suche murmure &amp; speche amōge hys owne company, whych foūded vnto the erle of warwykes fauoure, that he thoughte it was more vnto hys profyte to suffre hym to passe than to fight with him. But were it for thys cause or for other which ye commō fame rūneth vppō which were lōge to wryte / certayn &amp; trouth it is that the sayd erle passed wythout fyghte, &amp; came in sauete to Calays. In thys passe tyme a parliament or great coūsayll was holdē at Couentre. By auctoryte whereof the duke of yorke and all the other foresayde lordes wyth many other were attaynted, and theyr lādes &amp; goodes seased to the kynges vse. And for the more surer defēce that they shuld nat efte lande in Kēt, prouisiō was made to defende the hauēs &amp; portys vppon the sees syde. And at Sandwyche was ordeyned a new strēgthe wyth a capitayn named syr Symōde Moū
                        forde. And ouer thys prouision was ordeyned, that no marchaūt passyng into the costys of Flaūders, shulde passe or go by Calays, for fere that any shuld come to ye ayde of the sayd lordes. But thys prouysyon natwythstandyng / comfort to them was sent dayly out of Englād.
                     Than these lordes herynge of all thys prouysyon made vppō the sees syde to wythstāde theyr lādynge, sent out an other company vnto Sādewyche / the whych there skyrmysshed wyth the sayd syr Symōde Mountforde, &amp; in the ende toke hym &amp; broughte hym vnto Ryse Banke, &amp; there smote of hys hede. The foresayd lordes than cōsyderynge the strengthe, whych they had wyth them, and manyfolde frendes &amp; hartys, which they had in sundry places of Englād / condyscēded for to sayle into Englande, &amp; so to bryng about theyr entēt &amp; purpose. whych was as the cōmon fame went, to put a parte frome the kynge all suche persones as were enemyes to the cōmon weale of the lāde. And thys to bryng aboute, after they had set the towne of Calays in an order &amp; sure kepyng / they toke shyppynge, &amp; so sayled into Englāde, &amp; landed at Douer / and from thēs helde on theyr iourney thorughe Kente, so that they came to Londō the .ii. daye of Iuly. And after they had there refresshed theym and theyr people / they departed thense, &amp; sped theym towarde the kynge, which at ye same tyme of theyr lādynge was at Couentry, and there gathered his people / &amp; so came vnto

But after long fyght, the victory fell vnto the erle of Salysbury and the other lordes vpō his partye / &amp; the kynges hoste was sparcled &amp; chased, &amp; many of hys noble men slayen. Amōge the whyche was the duke of Buckynghan, the erle of Shrowsbury, ye vycoūt Beaumoūd, the lorde Egremōde, wyth many other knyghtes and esquyers / and the kyng taken in the felde. After whych victory thus by these lordes opteyned / they in goodly haste after retourned vnto Londō, and broughte wyth

them the kynge kepyng hys estate, &amp; lodged hym in the bysshop of Londō palays. And after spedye knowelege sent of all the premysses vnto ye duke of yorke yet beyng in Irelāde / a parlyamēt in the name of the kyng was than called &amp; holden at westmynster. Durynge whych parlyament ye duke of yorke came vnto westmynster vpō the frydaye before saynte Edwardes day or the .x. day of October, and lodged hym in the kynges palays. wherof anone arose a noyse thorugh the cytye, that kynge Henry shuld be deposed, &amp; the duke of yorke shulde be kynge. Uppō thys this parlyamente thus contynuynge, the duke came one daye into the parlyament chaumber / &amp; there boldely beyng the lordes present, sette hym downe in the kynges sete / &amp; so there sittynge, made a pretence and clayme vnto the crown, affermyng it to be hys ryghtfull enherytaūce / &amp; had there certayn bolde wordes in iustyfyenge of the same / wherewyth all the lordes presente were greatly dysmayed. For thys, great &amp; many opynions were moued among the lordes. Howe be it aswell dyuers of hys frendes as other, were of the mynde that he shuld nat be admytted for kynge, duryng the lyfe of kyng Henry. For appeasynge wherof, many great coūsayles were kepte aswell at the blacke freres as at westmynster.
                     In all whych tyme and season the quene wyth suche lordes as were of hyr affynyte, helde them in the north coūtrey / &amp; assembled to theym greate strengthe in the kynges name, to the ende to subdue as she sayde the kynges rebelles and enemyes. Thus contynuynge thys vnkyndenesse betwene the kynge and the duke / all be it that at that season bothe the kynge and he were bothe lodged within the palays of westmynster / yet wolde he natte for prayer nor instaunce ones bysyte the kynge, nor see hym, tyll the counsayll were concluded vppon some fynall ende concernyug thys greate matter / the whyche so continued the full terme of this mayres yere.

                        Than the kyng coosted and vysyted the coūtreys Southwarde &amp; Eestwarde / that about the begynnyng of the moneth of Iuny he came vnto hys manour of shene now called Rychemoūt.

Of thys Charlys sundry wryters sunderly wryte / in so moche as some afferme hym to be the naturall sonne of Charles the .vii / some afferme hym to be the sonne of the duke of Orleaunce &amp; borne of the quene / and some there ben that name hym the sonn̄ of Charles fore named gotten in the baste, vppon hys mooste beauteous paramour named Agnes / the whych as testyfyeth Gaguynus, excelled all other women in feture &amp; beaute, and for the same to be surnamed the fayer Agnes.

                           ō, as more at lengthe before I haue shewed vnto you in the .vii. yere of the sayd Henry the .v. But whether he be hys legyttymat sonne or nat, where uppō I purpose no lēger to stande / trouth it is that he was by his father admitted &amp; made dolphyne of Uyen / by reason wherof he was in a greate auctoryte, &amp; wan to hym fauoure of som lordes of Fraūce, whych strōgly maynteyned hys partye durynge the lyfe of kyng Hēry the .v, &amp; after all yt season whyle the duke of Bedforde occupyed there as regent of that regyō, &amp; was of some parties of Fraūce reputed for kyng. Howe be it he was neuer crowned, so lōge as the sayde duke of Bedforde lyued. Neuerthelesse he by meane of polycy &amp; hys frē
                           des so defended hym selfe, that lytle by the Englyshemē was wonne vpō hym, of suche lādes as he fyrste was in possessyon of. But polytykely he defended theym, &amp; lytle and lytle so preuayled agayne them, that in the ende he all onely wanne nat to hym the possessiō of that prouince yt which is named Fraūce, but also he wanne to hym in the ende the kynge of Englandes olde enherytaunce, that is Normandy, wyth all domynyons to the same apperteynynge.
                        The maner of wynnynge of them I woll nat in thys story speke of, for so moche as in the former yeres of kynge Henry the .vi. I haue there expressed the maner of somme parte therof. But that I shall speke of thē, shalbe of thynges done betwene hym &amp; other prynces. And for that I before in the .viii. yere of Hēry the vi, promysed in the .vi. yere of thys Charles to shewe vnto you som what of the maydē or pucel, which ye Frēch men named La 
                                 •
                              ucesse de dieu. la pucelle de dieu, &amp; her for a messenger from god to be sente reputed / I shall here folow ye saying of Gaguyne, whyche sayeth as foloweth. In the .vi. yere or there aboute, to rekyn from the deth of thys Charles father / a wēche or mayden beyng bred in a strete or vyllage called in latyne Ualli color, &amp; in thys tyme beynge sprōge to the age of .xx. yeres or there about, hauing to father a poore man named Iakes Delarch and hyr mother Isabell, she also berynge the name of Iane or Iohan / required by dyuers &amp; sundry tymes an vncle of hyrs beyng prefecte of the foresayde vyllage, that he wolde presente hyr vnto the Frēche kynge for thynges cōcernyng greatly the weale of hym &amp; of hys realme. whyche sayd prefect after many delayes, for so moche as in hyr wordes he had lytle truste / yet at lēgthe hyr sayd vncle beynge named Robert Baudryncourt, sent hyr wyth a cōuenyent company vnto the kyng, wyth letters certyfyenge hym of all the maner of thys mayde. wherof the sayd Charles beynge asserteyned / thought he wold vse som meane to knowe the vertue of thys wenche. And for he had perfyghte experyence that before tymes thys woman had neuer sene hys persone / he thoughte he wolde chaunge hys rome and habyte, to se whether she by hyr vertue coulde knowe hym frome other / and that done, he standynge amonge other of his familiers as one of them / she was called into the chaumber, &amp; demaunded yf euer before tyme she had sene the kynge. And after she hadde answered nay / she was byddē to espye oute the kynge, whych there stode amonge that companye.
                        The whyche anone wythout dyfficulte

him fande and saluted as king, And all be it that he refused hyr reuerēce, &amp; sayd yt she erred in hyr choyse / yet she parseuered kneling at his fete and sayde that by goddes purueyaūce she was taught that he was hyr very soueraygn prince &amp; none other. wherfore the kynge &amp; all hys lordes had in hyr the more affyaūce, that by hyr the lāde shulde be releuyd, whych at that daye was in passyng mysery. Than after dyuers questyōs to hyr made, what was the cause of hyr thyther commynge / she answered &amp; sayd that she was sent frome god, to stablisshe the kynge in hys realme / and that by hyr she beynge leder &amp; capytayne of hys people, by dyuine grace onely the kynge shulde shortely subdue hys enemyes. By reasō of which wordes, the kyng wyth hys lordes were somedeale comforted.
                        Upon thys, armour &amp; sword was sought for this maydē / the whych as sayeth my sayd auctour, was foūden myraculously / wherof the processe to me appereth so darke &amp; fātastycall, yt therewith me list nat to blot my boke but suffre it to passe by. Than thys wēche being purueyed of all thinges necessary to the warre / a company of knyghtes &amp; soudyours to hyr by the kynge was assygned. And so she rydynge as a man &amp; in mānes habyte / contynued by the space of .ii. yeres &amp; more, and dyd many wonderful feates / and gat from the Englysshemen many strōge townes and holdes. wherefore amonge Frenchemen she was wordshypped for an aūgell or a messynger sent frome god, to releue theyr great myserye. And as affermeth the sayd auctour / she by hyr prouydence caused the sayd Charles as kynge of Fraunce to be crowned at Raynes, in the yere of oure lord .M. foure hundreth and .xxix.
                        All be it nouther the Frenche cronycle nor other, whyche I haue sene testyfyeth that / but affermyn that he was nat crowned duryng the lyfe of the duke of Bedforde. But almyghty god whyche for a season suffereth suche sorcery and deuelyssh ways to prospere &amp; reygne, to the correccyon of synners / lastely to shewe hys power, and that good men shuld nat fall into any erroure, he sheweth the clerenesse of suche mystycall thynges / and so he dyd in thys.Thende lapucelle de dieu. For lastely she by a knyghte Burgonyon was taken, &amp; after sent to Roan, and there brēt for her demerytes, as in the .viii yere of Henry the .vi. is more at lēgth shewed. Thā the tyme forth passyng, and cōtynuall warre betwene Englande &amp; Fraūce contynuyng / among many trybulacions by thys Charles susteyned, one that was hys owne sonn̄ named Lewys, comforted and assysted by the dukes of Burbō and Alēson wyth other mē of name, rebelled agayne hys father, and warred vppon hym / and by strengthe wan frome hym certeyne townes &amp; strong holdes. For remedy whereof / the sayde Charles made warre vppon the forenamed duke of Burbon / and wasted wyth iron and fyre the countreyes of the sayde duke of Burbon. By meane whereof, after thys vnkyndely warre hadde duryd by the space of syxe monethes or more / a peace and vnyte betwene the father &amp; sonne was treated / &amp; by meanes of the erle of Ewe, a cōcorde &amp; vnite betwene them was fynally cōcluded / &amp; he ye sayd Lewys &amp; all suche as wyth hym were reteyned or allied, were for thys offēce by ye sayd Charles clerely pardoned / one persone all only excepted named Iaket or Iakis, by whose treason the castell of Maxente was loste and taken / for whyche offence he was after drawen, hanged, &amp; also quartered.
                        
                           Thā in processe of tyme folowyng the flemynges of Gaūte rebelled agayne theyr duke or erle named Philyp. The cause of whyche rebellyon was, for that he areryd a greuouse taske vpō salte / &amp; put the people ther by to greuouse charge. wherevppon dedely warre betwene the duke and hys subiectys arose, to the dystrucciō of moche people vpō bothe partyes, wherof the cyrcumstaūce were lōg to wryte. Howe be it in the ende ye duke or erle by ayde of the Frēche kynge was vyctour / &amp; helde them of Gaūte so streyghte, that they were compelled by force to bye theyr peace wyth great summes of money, &amp; to theyr other many folde domages.
                        About the .xxxi. yere of thys sayde Charles / came vnto hym from pope Nycholas the .v. of that name an ambassade, for to requyre ayde agayne the Turkys, for the defēce of Cōstantyne the noble, whyche the Turkys purposed shortly after to assayle. To whyche ambassade by the sayd Charlys it was answeryd, that to hym it was right greuouse to here of the intollerable persecucyō, whych ye cristē dayly susteyned of the Turkys. But he was of ye Englysh nacyō so vexed and warred, that he myghte nat leue hys lāde wythout an hedde, to the cō
                           forte of other, &amp; to lose hys owne. But to the entent that he before tymes myght haue warred vppon the sayd Turkys / he for that cause onely had offered vnto the kynge of Englande many reasonable offers. And if of the Englysshe party any lyke offers myghte be to hym profered / he wolde gladly theym accepte, &amp; turne hys spere incōtynētly agayn the fore named Turkes. And ouer that he wolde for the furtheraūce of the matter, sende wyth them vnto the kynge of Englāde certayne ambassadours, to se yf that as yet any reasonable peace myght be betwene them cōcluded. For accomplisshemēt wherof as testyfyeth myne auctour Gaguynus he sente the archebysshop of Raynes wyth other honorable persones. The whych whan they to kyng Henry and hys counsayll hadde shewyd theyr legacyō / it was to them shortly answered, that at suche season as the Englysshemē hadde wonne agayne so moche lāde as the Frenchemen by cawtelys had wōne from theym / thā were it good tyme &amp; season to treate of accorde, &amp; nat before. By reason of whiche answere / the popes ambassade retourned to Rome wythoute ayde or comforte. And thus ye Frēche wryters lay euer the charge frō theyr prynce, &amp; put it vnto other. But of thys ambassade or answere, fynde I no memory of any Englysshe wryters.
                        Aboute the .xxxiiii. yere of ye reygn of thys Charlys / Lewys hys sonne before named beynge a mā of greate lyberalitye and largesse, thought his father departed nat wyth hym of his mouables &amp; possessyōs as he hadde cause to do. For the whych by cōfort of yōge persones as he had aboute hym, he rebelled thys seconde tyme agayne hys sayde father / &amp; by reason of hys largesse &amp; lyberalyte, drewe vnto hym moche wāton &amp; wylde people / &amp; wyth theyr assystence warred vppō hys fathers frēdes, &amp; entendyd to depryue hys father of all gouernaūce of the realme. wherof herynge hys father / in all possyble haste gathered to hym greate strengthe, and spedde hym towarde hys sayd sonn̄. But whā Lewys was warned of the cōmyng of hys father wyth so great an hoste, &amp; consydered hys quarell &amp; wekenesse / he wyth a fewe persones fledde towarde Burgoyne. whereof herynge the father sente in all 
                              •
                           haste people to kepe the passages / and dyd

that he myghte to haue stopped hym of hys waye. But that prouysyon notwythstandynge / the sayd Lewys escaped, and came sauely vnto the presence of Phylyppe then duke of Burgoyne / the whyche hym receyued wyth gladde chere, and entreatyd hym accordyng to his estate, and so kepte hym durynge his fathers lyfe. Nowbeit he made for hym great sute and labour, to wynne him to his fathers grace. But all was in vayne. For what by obstynacy of the same yt he wolde not submytte hym to his father, and comme vnto hys presence when he was sente for, &amp; for the great stomacke of the father, that he wold not be condycyoned with of the son / thys varyaunce contynued bytwene them as aboue is sayd ye terme of his fathers lyfe. In the whyche passe tyme thys Charlys concluded a maryage bytwene hys doughter called Magdaleyne, and Ladyslaus kyng of Beme, Hungary, and of Polayne. But whyle the bryde wyth great apparayle and pompe was conueyed towarde her husbande to be maryed / her sayde husbande was taken sodenly with sykenesse, and dyed with in .xxiiii. houres after that he fyrste cōplayned hym / whych was by force of poysone as most wryters agreen. Of whych tydynges when Charlys was asserteyned / he therwyth toke such a pēsyffenesse, that he dyed shortely after, whan he had ruled a parte and the hole realme, to reken from ye deth of hys father .xxxvi. yeres. How be it of Frenche wryters no certeyne terme of hys reygne to hym is assygned / for so myche as kyng Henry the vi. longe after the deth of hys father, was alowyd in Parys and many other Cytyes of Fraūce for souerayne and kynge of that regyon. Thys Charlys thus beynge dede, lefte after hym two sonnes / that is to saye Lewys that after hym was kynge, and a yonger named Charlys, wyth ye forenamed doughter named Magdaleyne, or after some Margarete. And after wyth greate pompe hys corps was conueyed vnto saynt Denys, and there buryed.

                           LEwys the .xi. of y• name after the accompte of thys boke, and .x. after the Frenche accompte, whereof ye cause is before shewed, sonne to Charles last dede / beganne his dominyon ouer the realme of Fraunce, in the moneth of October, in the yere of grace .M.iiii. hundreth and .lviii. and the .xxxvi. yere of Henry the .vi. than kynge of Englande. This of Gaguinus is called the sturdy or fel Lewys. The whiche at the tyme of his fathers deth, beyng, as aboue is sayd vnrecoūsyled in the prouynce of Burgoyne, &amp; herynge of the deth of his father / wyth ayde of the foresayd duke Phylyp shortly entred ye realm of Fraunce, &amp; toke vpon hym ye rule in euery good cytie &amp; town as he passyd as kyng of ye same / so yt many lordes &amp; hed offycers drewe vnto hym. By meane wherof he was stronge / &amp; put such vnto sylence, as after ye wyll &amp; purpose of his father wolde haue preferred his yōger son named Charlys. Than this Lewys by strengthe of his frendes was shortely after at Raynes crowned kynge of Fraunce. After whyche solempnyte fynysshed, he repayred vnto Parys / and there by consent of hys counceyll made a law, yt no man of what degre that he were, shuld vse hūtyng or hawkynge without special lycēce / &amp; specially for

chasynge or huntyng of woluys / nor to kepe wyth hym any houndes or other instrumētes wherby the game myghte be destroyed. And that done, Phylyp foresayd duke of Burgoyne after counsayll to hym gyuen that he shulde forgette and forgyue all dyspleasurs to hym 
                              •
                           ofore done by any of hys lordes, and them to honoure and cherysshe / &amp; specyally his yonge brother Charlys to norysshe and to departe wyth hym louyngly of hys fathers possessions / toke leue of hym and departed. After whose deꝑture / he contrary the foresayde counsayll, refused the company of hys lordes &amp; also theyr counsayll / and drewe vnto hym as his chyefe counsaylours vylaynes and men of lowe byrth. Of yt whyche, the .iiii. pryncypall were named as foloweth, Iohn̄ de Lude, Iohn̄ Balna, Olyuer Deuyll, whō for the odyousnesse of the name the kynge caused it to be chaunged and to be named Dāman / and the fourth was named Stephan and vssher of the kynges chaumber dore / the whithe he promoted to greate honour &amp; dygnytees. Amonge whome Balna beynge a preste, was by hys meanes at length made a cardynall of Rome.
                        Thus he vsynge the counsayle of these persons / murmur and grudge began to sprynge bytwene hym and hys lordes / in so myche that fyrst the duke of Brytayne began to estraūge hym from the kynge, and refused to come vnto hys presence whā he was sente for. wherof herynge the erle of Ewe wyth other, drewe them vnto ye duke. To the whyche party soone after, ye kynges brother Charlys, with also the duke of Burbon whych had maried the kynges syster, with many other noble men of the realme, resortyd. whan the kynge was ware that hys lordes conspyred agayne hym / ferynge the rebellyon of hys comōs, sent in spedy maner vnto Parys the forenamed Iohn̄ Balna wyth other certeyne persons, to kepe that cytye in due obeysaūce toward hym / thynkynge that the other cytyes &amp; good townes of hys regyon, wolde take ensample therof, and demeane them as that cytye dyd. After whose commynge / the rulers of Parys by the amonystement of the sayd Iohn̄, ordeyned good and sure watche / and so by that meane kept the cytye in good order. And in the meane season, the kynge gathered to hym great foyson of knyghtes and soudyours, that his hoste was nombred at .xxx. thousand men. And in lyke wyse the other partye hadde assembled as many or mo. And not wythstandyng the assyduat laboure and meanes made by ye duke of Burgoyne, and Carlota wyfe to ye duke of Burbon &amp; syster to the kyng as is aboue sayde, to make an vnyte and peace bytwene Lewys and hys lordes / yet fynally the kynge &amp; they mette in playne batayll at a place called Chartres, where bytwene theym was a longe and cruell batayll, to ye losse of moche people on bothe partyes. And all be it that the kynge in the begynnynge hadde the better of hys enemyes / yet in the ende he was ouercomen, his men chaced, and he forced to flye, &amp; to take for hys sauegarde a castell named Mountclere. From the whyche he shortely departyd, and yode to an other castell called Corboyll, and from thens lastly vnto Parys / where he entendyd to haue gathered newe people, and to haue reuenged hym of hys enemyes. But by the wyse and good exortacyō of the bysshoppe of Parys, the kyng chaunged hys purpose / and all was set in a quyetnesse for that tyme. But how or in what maner, or what the condycyons of ye accorde were / myne authour dothe not expresse. The

whyche accorde thus concluded / the kynge contynued hys olde maners, and delyted hym more to companye with symple and inreuerent parsons to eate and drynke wyth them, to the ende that he myghte talke of rybaudry and vayne and vycyous fables / than to accompany him with his lordes, where he myghte haue wonne hym myche honour. Thys Lewys also was of so dyuers and wanton condycyon, that he wolde go more lyker a yoman or a seruyng man, than lyke a prynce. The whyche was for no regardshyp nor sparyng of good / for as before I haue shewed, &amp; also after shall appere, he was a prynce of moste lyberalyte, and therwith an oppressour of hys subiectes.
                        LEwis thus passing his time / was dryuen of necessyte for lacke of money, to a preste of the cytesyns of Parys. The whyche after many excusys by them layd to put it by, and myghte not be alowed / they lastly denayed the kynges pleasure. where wythall he beynge greuously dyscontentyd, remoued diuerse from theyr offyces / and other whych were of the rychest and hed men of ye cyte, he soughte agayne theym surmysed causes / &amp; without prouys or iustyce, put many of them to deth. For these foresayde causes &amp; many other whyche tedyouse were to expresse, the foresayd lordes agayne assembled theyr people / entēdyng to subdue ye kynge, and to set hys brother in hys place / or to cause hym otherwyse to rule ye comon weale. And to strength the barons party / Iohn̄ sonne vnto ye duke of Calabre approched to them, wyth a good bande of men. And to them came also the sonne of the duke of Burgoyne named Charlys. All whiche barons of one assent mette at a towne called Stampys / where they cōtynued theyr coūsayle by the space of .xv. dayes / and after that coūsayle fynysshed, toke theyr iournaye towarde Parys. In whych passe tyme a spye of the duke of Brytaynes, called Peter Gerold was taken in Parys, and drawen, hanged, and quartered / and dyuers men and women yt were suspected to owe fauour vnto the lordes, were sacked and caste in to the water of Seyn. Then for to strength and guyde the cytye of Parys, the kynge sent thyder the erle of Donoyse / by whose prouysyon all warly ordenaunce for to defende theyr enemyes was there preparyd. In the which tyme &amp; season, ye lordes in .iii. partes enbatayled, approched the cytye. wherof ye fyrste hoste ladde Charlys brother vnto the kynge / the seconde the duke of Brytayne / &amp; the thyrd Charlys the sonne to the duke of Burgoyne. Prouyded that Charlys fyrste named ladde the myddleward. whā the sayd erle of Donoyse hadde well consydered the strength of the lordes / he sente vnto theym a messanger, sayeng that in his mynde he maruayled to see so greate a multytude of people assembled agayne the cytye and comon weale of ye land / consyderyng that he was sette there by the kynge as a medyatour and a meane, rather to make peace than warre, yf they were contentyd that by hym any medyacyon myghte be laboured and hadde. But thys came to none effecte, so that small assautes and skyrmysshes ensued, to the lytell domage of bothe partes. In whyche passe tyme the kynge sent by secrete meanes vnto the forenamed Iohn̄ sonne vnto the duke of Calabre / and hym by many meanes instaunted, to leue the company of the lordes. But all his offers auayled ryght nought. Thenne the foresayde lordes thus lyenge before the cytye of Parys, in

the playne where standeth the monastery of saynt Antony / Charlys brother to the kynge caused .iiii. letters to be deuysed. wherof one he sent to the bysshoppes and spyrytuall men within the cytye / the seconde to the consulles or hed men / the thyrde to ye scolers of the vnyuersyte / and ye .iiii. vnto the comynaltye. Of whyche letters the entent ensueth / that he nor none of hys company was comen thyder as an enemye to the cytye, or to make warre agayne it or the comon weale of the land / but for the encreace and augmentacyon therof, to the vttermost of theyr powers. After receyte of whyche letters, and the mater in them conteyned well vnderstā
                           den and debatyd / certeyne oratours for the sayde .iiii. partyes were assygned / as thre for the spyrytuall men, thre for the consuls, thre for the vnyuersyte, &amp; thre for comynaltye / whose names I ouer passe. The whyche wyth the bysshop of Parys were sent vnto the barons / &amp; after longe communycacyon wyth them hadde, retourned to the cytie with such report as foloweth.
                        Fyrste the lordes wolde that the inhabytauntes of the cytye shulde cō
                           syder the condycyons of the kynge, yt whyche yerely oppressyth his subiectes with taskes and other greuouse seruagys. Secondaryly how he despyseth ye noble blode of hys realme, and draweth to hym vylaynes and men of no reputacyon / by whose coū
                           sayls onely all the comon weale of ye land is ruled and guyded. Thyrdely how he ruleth hys subiectes by force and wyll, wythout mynystracyon of iustyce / and hym selfe in all coūsayls and parlyaments is iudge in all causes, and callyth hys selfe counsayls and parlyamentes, more for hys synguler weale than for the comō weale of his realme. Fourthely how he enhaunsyth men of lowe byrthe vnto greate honours and causyth noble men to be obedyent vnto them / entendynge to brynge the same ignoble men, for to be egall wyth the prynces of the lande. Fyftely how the lawes be delayed and bolstred by suche as stande in his fauour / where thorugh as thys daye lawe is wyll and wyll is lawe / and no man almoste in any suerty of lyfe or goodes / in so moche that dayly many ben banysshed and put to deth for vnlefull causes / and also to any noble man at this daye no power or rome of honour belongeth / so that to wylde bestes in the forestes apperteyneth more lybertye and suertye, than the more partye of the kynges subgettes. Syxtly the greate taskes and summes of money whych dayly be leuyed of the comōs ben not spent in the kynges honourable nedes and for the comon weale of the realme / but are spent nysely &amp; ryottously, and brybed out of ye kynges cofers. For whyche enormytees &amp; mysgouernaūce with many other / the sayde lordes were thyder comen in defensyble araye, for ye sauegarde of theyr owne persons / as to the hed and pryncypall cytie of the realme, for to haue ayde and counsayle to refourme the foresayd euyls / not with standynge any harme vnto the kynges persone, or yet to remoue hym from his regally or kyngly maieste / but to enduce hym &amp; aduertyse hym to that that shuld be his honour and the weale of hys realme, and to lyue in welthe and honour as hys noble ꝓgenitours haue lyued before hym. For the whyche causes and consyderacyons wyth many other whych I passe ouer / the sayde lordes as ye kynges trewe subeittes and frendes vnto the comon weale of the lande and of that cytye, desyre to entre / there to refresshe them and theyr people, and

to pay truely for all thynge that they shulde take, &amp; wythout doyng harme or vyolence to any persone. All whyche requestes and maters of the lordes shewed vnto the inhabytauntes of the cytye, by fauour of some frendes that they there had, it was with the more partye well acceptyd, and thought conuenyent that they sayde nobles shuld be receyued into the cytye. How be it that after longe debatynge of thys mater, by meane of the forenamed erle of Donoyse, a sparynge of thys receyte of the lordes shuld be, tyll they had forther knowlege of the kynges pleasure. whyche prouysyon the sayd erle fande, for so mych as he was secretely warned of the kynges thyder comynge. And vpon thys agremēt the cytye rested. For suertye wherof, suche as were within the cytye of the kynges seruauntes and frendes, rode dayly &amp; nyghtly about ye cyty wyth a stronge company in harneys, to se the people kepte in due order. Than vppon the daye folowynge came vnto Parys a capytayne of ye kynges named Moū
                           talbone, and wyth hym a good bend of men / the whyche shewyd vnto the cytesyns that the kyng was comyng out of Normandye with a great host of. The lordes beynge warned / enbatayled them in the foresayde playne of saynte Antoyn, to shewe the strength of theyr hoste vnto the cytye, or suche as were therin as theyr enemyes. where they so lyenge / certayne knyghtes of the kynges party, diuerse and sondry tymes brake out by sodeyne resys, and skyrmysshed wyth the lordes people, to the lytell hurte of bothe partyes. In the whych passe tyme kynge Lewys comynge out of Normandye, was receyued into the cytye. where after hys comynge he put in execucyon .v. persons, named Iohn̄ worter, Eustace and Arnolde worter, Iohn̄ Coart, and Fraunceys Hasle. The whyche persons were accusyd to hym to be chyefe occasyoners of the legacyon made vnto the lordes. Of whyche sayde .v. persons / thre, as Iohn̄ Coart, Fraunceys Hasle, &amp; Arnolde worter, were messengers assygned in the sayde legacyon for the consuls of Parys / and the forenamed Eustace worter, was one of the thre assygned for the clergye.
                        The kynge thus beynge in possessyō of the cytye / many and dyuers assautes and skyrmysshes bytwene hys knyghtes and the lordes were made / but no notary batayle, for the kynge was ferre weker. And ouer that in thys tyme &amp; season, the sayde lordes gat vnto them sondry castels and stronge holdes. Than at length meanes of a peace was offeryd by ye kynge. For concludyng wherofꝭ for the kynge was admytted the erle of Mans, with certayne other persons. And for the barons, was assygned Iohn̄ sonne vnto the duke of Calabre, Lewys erle of saynt Poule and other / the whyche assembled and cō
                           moued togyder by sondry tymes .ix. dayes. In whyche season came vnto the kynge a newe strength of soudyours out of Normandye / the whych the kyng appoynted to kepe the subarbes of saynt Marcell. Thys treaty thus hangyng wythout conclusyō or ende takynge / vppon the .xiiii. day of October in the .vii. yere of ye reygn of thys Lewys, was proclaymed thorough the cytye and also the hoste a day of lenger treuce / so that thanne the lordes wythdrewe theym vnto theyr stronge holdes and castels, holdynge wyth them many soudyours whyche fyll to robbynge and other vnlefull actes, to the greate daunger and hurte of the lande. And at suche seasons as the arbytrours met

to fynysshe this great mater / among other thynges offeryd by the kynge, he graunted to gyue vnto hys brother Charlys for hys porcyon, all Champayne wyth the lordshyppe of Brye / the cytyes of Melde, Monstruell, and Meldune therof to be excepted. And vnto Charlys sonne of the duke of Burgoyne, he was contented to gyue so myche money as he hadde spent in that iournay. But all was refused. And fynally for obstynacy of bothe partyes / the daye of expyracyon of the trewe approchyd, wythout hope of accord cōcludyng. wherfore prouysyon for warre vpon bothe partyes was deuysed. Than begā grudge and murmure bytwen the cytesyns and the kynges sowdyours / wherthorough many of the comons hertes turned to the lordes / so that for fere the surer and stronger watches were kepte to the kynges great charge. Shortely after tydynges were brought vnto the kynge yt the castell of Gysons was of the lordes vesyeged / and that also the prefecte of the kynges paleys in Roan, was taken of the cytesyns and holden in prysone. And the daye folowynge came an other messengare, shewynge vnto the kynge that the duke of Burbone was by the posterne receyued into the castell of Roan / and was lykely to haue shortely the rule of the cytye / whyche came to effecte in shorte whyle after. whan the lordes hadde gotten the castell and cyty of Roan, whyche is hed cytye of Normandy as Parys is hed of Fraunce / than in maner of derysyon they sent vnto ye kynge, sayenge that nother with Champayne nor with Bry hys brother Charlys wold be contented, but scantely wyth the hole duchy of Normandy. Than kynge Lewys cō
                           syderyng the great auaūtage, which ye lordes had of him, both by strength and fauour of hys comons whyche dayly drewe vnto them by sondry cō
                           panyes / in auoydyng of more daunger, concludyd a peas. For perfourmaūce wherof, he graūted vnto Charlys his brother ye hole duchy of Normandy / takyng to hym in exchaūge the county of Berry. And to Charlis sonne to the duke of Burgoyne, Peron̄, Roya, &amp; a cytye or towne called in latyne Mondideriū / and therwith he ioyned Gwynary and ye erledome of Boloyne / which lordshyps ye sayd kynge Lewys hadde before tymes bought of duke Phylyp his father. To Iohn̄ of Calabre he graūted all such sūmes of money as he demaundyd, to wage with soudiours to ayde his father agayne Fardynande then kyng of Aragon. And to Iohn̄ duke of Burbon, yt which as before is said had maryed his syster / he graūted all such dowar as to hym was ꝓmysed at ye tyme of maryage / &amp; all such pencyon as he was wont yerely to take, of the graunte of Charlys last kyng within the realme of Fraūce. To the duke of Brytayne was restoryd the erledome of Moūtferard, with great sūmes of money which the kyng had receyued of the sayd county. And to ye erle of Dampmartyne was restored all suche landes as before by acte of parlyamēt were forfayted to ye kyng. To the erle of saynt Poule was restored the offyce of the constablerye of Fraūce / &amp; to other mē of name other notable thynges which I passe ouer. All whyche grauntes fermely and fastely assuryd / proclamacyons were made of thys pease thoroughe the realme of Fraunce. And after thys pease was thus concluded / the kyng and hys lordes mette. To whome he shewed greate semblaunt of kyndnesse / and specyally vnto hys brother. wherin appered great dyssymulacyon, as here after shall appere.

For thys Lewys was of suche condycion, that what he myght not ouer come wyth strength, he wold wynne wyth dyssymulacyon and trechety, After whyche peace thus concluded, and the lordes departed / the kynge festyd the rulers and consuls of the cytye of Parys / and gaue vnto them due thankes, for the greate trouth &amp; fydelyte, whyche they bare towarde hym duryng that troubelous season and graunted vnto them suche thynges, as then they wolde aske for the weale of that cytye.
                        IT was not longe after, that dyssymulacyon fell bytwene Charlys duke of Normandye, and Iohn̄ foresayde sonne vnto the duke of Calabre and the erle of Dampmartyne. wherof a parte of the cause was, that the sayde Charlys after theyr thynkyng, hadde not so bounteously rewarded them as they had deserued. Of whyche dyscorde kyng Lewys was fayne / and in spedy maner rode vnto a towne called Argentyne / and there wyth the sayd Iohn̄ than beynge duke of Calabre, by reason of hys fathers deth, helde wyth hym longe and great counsayll, to ye entent to dyspossesse hys brother of the duchy of Normandye. By reason of whych dyscorde bytwene the sayd two dukes / kynge Lewys as ayder of the duke of Calabre, made warre in the partyes of Normandye / and in processe wanne therin dyuers castels and other stronge holdes, and compelled hys brother to holde the cytye of Roan for hys refuge. where he so beynge / the kyng wanne dayly vppon hym / in so myche that dyuers townes and stronge holdes submytted them to his grace. wherof hering the cytesyns of Roan, made an ambassade vnto the kynge, for purchace of grace for theyr duke and for them selfe. The whych when the duke vnderstode, ferynge leste his owne cytesyns wolde betraye hym, fled thens / and so yode to Humflewe, and from thens to Cadomy. In whyche passe tyme ye kynge was wyth due honour receyued into ye cytie of Roan / where he remoued many from theyr offices, and of his seruauntes or such as lyked hym put in theyr places / &amp; moch of the ordynaunce and of abylymentes of warre belongynge to ye towne he sent vnto Parys / and the prouost of Roan named Gauyne Manuell he put to deth / &amp; after hys body was cast into the ryuer, and his hed sette vppon a pole / &amp; dyuers of the colege wyth the deane of ye same place were put vnto deth. And all whych tyrannye by the kynge executyd, and the towne put in suertye by strength of soudyours / he after spedde hym vnto Orleaunce, where as sayth myne authour he puruayed an honorable ambassade, and sent it vnto Edward the .iiii. then kynge of Englande.
                        In the .ix. yere of ye reygne of thys Lewys was so greate a mortalyte of men in Fraunce, that in Parys dyed that yere ouer .xl.M. people. And in thys yere began a grudge to growe bytwene this Lewys and Phylyppe duke of Burgoyne. But it was kept vnkyndely duryng ye lyfe of ye duke, which dyed shortely after. To whom succedyd Charlys his sonne before named, which in processe of tyme maryed dame Margarete syster vnto kynge Edward ye .iiii. as after shalbe shewyd. It was not longe after that thys Lewys assembled a great hoste of people to make warre vpon Charlys duke of Burgoyne. Of whyche people he had cōmytted the rule and charge vnto Iohn̄ Balna, whych at that daye was preste and cardynall / and he as a tēporall capytayne, toke of them the mustyrs &amp; other orders. where at the tēporall lordes dysdaynynge

/ the erle of Dāpmartyne sayd in the names of them vnto the kyng. Moste redouted souerayne lorde, it hath pleased your hyghnesse to commytte vnto a spyrytuall mā ye charge of your puyssaunt hoste / &amp; he not ferynge god, hath taken vpon hym the cure and charge of them, to the effusyon of crystē mēnes blode. wherfore it may lyke your most noble grace, to sende me a temporall man to vysyte his dyocese, and to take the charge of his flocke / whyche is as syttynge for me, as that other dede is for him. At this sayeng the kyng hadde good game / but for all yt he dyd as to hym semyd best. Of this warre bytwene ye kyng &amp; duke Charlys of Burgoyne I entende not to speke / for the mater of it is somde
                              •
                           e long and tedyous to wryte. But in this whyle that Lewys was occupyed in thys warre / yt Brytons with an excedynge power assayled ye partyes of Norue hauyng Charlis broder vnto Lewis to theyr leder, whych to the duke of Brytayn was fled for ayde &amp; socoure. wherof herynge kyng Lewys / all such hoste of sowdyours as he hadde purposed other wayes, he than ladde agayne hys brother. In whych hoste as after myth myne authour, were an .C.M. men, ouer such as had the guydyng of the ordenaūce. whā Charlys was aduertysed of the greate strength of hys brother / by polytyke meanes he soughte for a peace. And after many delatory communycacyōs and other delayous meanes wroughte vppon bothe partyes / lastely the kynge sent vnto hys brother Iohn̄ Balna cardynall wyth other, to shewe vnto hym hys mynde and pleasure. wherof whan Charlys was suffycyently instructed / he gaue for an answere, that yf a perfyghte concorde shulde be stablysshed bytwene hys brother and hym, that it shuld be authorysed by the hole concent and counsayle of the barony of the realme. with which answere the kyng beyng contentyd / at Turon in the moneth of Apryll &amp; x. yere of hys reygne, assembled a greate counsayle of hys lordes spyrytuall and temporall / in the whyche ye demaūdys of the sayde Charlys and offers of the kyng were shewed. And after the sayd coūsayle had at length reasoned the sayde demaundes and offers / it was fynally determyned, yt the duchy of Normandye was so approuyd vnto the kynge of Fraunce and to hys heyres kynges, that in no wyse it myghte be dysseueryd from ye crowne. But to the entent that a perfyght vnyte myghte be had bytwene the kynge and hys brother / the kyng shall be instaūted to gyue yerely vnto hys sayd brother in recōpensemēt of ye sayd duchy .xii. thousand poūde of Turō money / wyth also a certeyn of lande to hym to be assygned wyth the name of a duke / and ouer that ye kynge to be instanted to gyue vnto hym durynge hys naturall lyfe, for suche porcyō as he claymed to be his ryghte wythin the realme .xl.M.li. of annuell rente yerely to hym to be payed of the foresayd Turō money. To all whyche grauntes the kynge was agreed / &amp; ouer that to pardon ye duke of Brytayne all offences nowe newly done agayne hys maieste, and contrary the dukes faythe and allegaunce / and all such lordshyppes as the kynge hadde wonne wythin Brytayne, to restore vnto the duke &amp; hys assygnes. All ye whych offers myght not satysfye the coūsayle of the sayd Charlys / but clerely was set aparte and refused.
                        AFter the foresayd offers were by Charles refused / the kyng in spedy wyse vppon the refusayll sent a stronge hoste into Brytayne, vnder the guydynge of a knyghte

called Arnolde. And in the meane season the kyng vysytyng the bordours of hys realme / put in execucyon dyuerse parsones, suche as were accused to offende agayne hym. Passynge whych season, were it for the greuys whyche the foresayd hoste wroughte wythin the coūtrey of Brytayne, or for other skyll / the foresayd Charlys &amp; the duke of Brytayne made newe meanes for a peace vnto the kynge / &amp; offered to be contentyd, wyth that they myght stande in hys fauoure &amp; grace, wyth suche proffers as the coū
                           sayll of the realme was before tyme agreed and cōdyssended vpon. where unto a sophystycall answere was made by the kyng / so that the sayd Charles at that tyme myghte nat be asserteyned of peace or of warre. Howe be it in the yere folowyng by instaūt labour of the fore named Iohn̄ Balna cardynall, the kynge agreed to gyue vnto hys brother Charlys the duchy of Guyan onely. where wyth he helde hym cōtēted / &amp; so ceased of his warre in Normādy.
                        It was nat lōge after that thys sayde Iohn̄ Balna forgetynge ye manyfolde great benefytes shewed to hī by the kynge / cōspyred agayne hym, &amp; deuysed certayne letters / the which he sent vnto Charlys duke of Burgoyne. wherin was cōteyned that he shulde beware and haue hym selfe in good gayte / for the vnyte and peace whyche lately was stablysshed betwene the kynge &amp; Charlys hys brother, was principally to dere &amp; warre vppon hym, &amp; to brynge hym in subieccyon. wherfore in auoydynge that daūger / he aduysed hym in all possyble haste to assemble hys knyghtys, that he were nat takē vnpurueyed. The whyche letters were it by reasō of the berer or otherwyse, came to ye kynges presence. After receyt of whyche letters, &amp; knowlege of the cō
                           tent of them / anone the kynge caused the sayde Iohn̄ Balna to be taken, &amp; to be caste in stronge prysone. And that done he rode vnto Thuron / whyther to hym came hys brother Charles, and to hym dyd homage, &amp; sware vnto him feauty for the duchy of Guyan. And for to knytte the duke of Brytayne more fastly to hym / he sente to hym a sceptre wyth a chayne of golde / the whyche the duke refused to take, wherewyth Lewys was greuously dyscōtēted. The cause of whyche refusall was, for the sayde duke of Brytayne had lately before that allyed hym wyth Charlys duke of Burgoyne, &amp; had receyued hys lyuerey of golden flees. And soone after, whyche was the .xi. yere of thys Lewys / Carlota hys wyfe was lyghted of a sonn̄, &amp; after named Charles by Charlys hys brother / whych after hys father was kynge of Fraūce. And shortly after by meanes of Charlys duke of Guyan, &amp; of the duke of Burbon &amp; other / the duke of Brytayn was recoūcyled vnto the kyngꝭ fauoure. And in ye .xii. yere of ye reygn of thys Lewys, dyed by force of veni the aboue named Charlys duke of Guyan. But by whose meanes myne auctour myndeth nat.
                        Than cōtynuynge the warre betwene thys Lewys &amp; thys duke of Burgoyne / a marchaunt of Guyan named Itery, which after the deth of the sayd duke of Guyan was fledde vnto the duke of Burgoyne, &amp; wyth hym a seasō remayned / shewed vnto hym many tedyous talys of ye kyng. wherfore the duke apperceyuynge yt he owed to the Frenche kynge no fauoure / exorted hym to poyson ye sayd kynge. And yf he myght brynge to effecte hys purpose / he shuld therefore haue .l.M. florynes of golde. A floryne is in value of sterlynge money .iii.s. After whyche promyse and

assuraunce thus made by the duke / thys Itery to brynge hys euyll purpose about, made hys seruaunt named Iohn̄ de Boldy of coūsayll / and promysed to hym greate thynges, yf he wolde take vpon hym that acte. And after graunt hadde of the sayde Iohn̄ / the sayd Itery prouided ye poyson, &amp; delyuered it vnto hys sayd seruaūt. The whych incontynētly sped hym vnto Ambasye, where the Frēch kyng than laye / where thys Iohn̄ de Boldy beynge of famylyer acqueyntaunce wyth one named Popyn, to ye entent to brynge hys entent ye better to effecte, after assuraūce of othe to hī made to kepe hys counsayll / shewyd vnto hym all hys mynde, &amp; promised to hym .xx.M. florynes yf he wolde helpe to brynge to conclusyon hys purpose. The whyche Popyn made vnto hym assured promyse / &amp; sayde y• to brynge thys mater aboute, it was very expedyent to haue of counsayll the kynges mayster cooke named Colynet / whome he knewe well to wyn, for the great fauoure that eyther of them owed vnto other. And after cō
                           munycacyon had wyth the sayd Colynet / the sayd poysone to hym was delyuered. wherwyth the sayd Colynet &amp; Popyn hys felowe went a conuenyent tyme vnto the kynge, &amp; shewyd to hym the compasse of all ye mater. where after anone the sayde Iohn̄ de Boldy was taken, &amp; confessed the cyrcumstaūce of all the hoole treason / for the whyche at Parys he was after drawen, hanged, and quartered. Soone vpō thys, Frederyke ye iii. of ye name than emperoure of Almayne, sente vnto thys Lewys / wyllyng &amp; requyryng hym that he wolde nat endeuer hym to any peace or accorde with ye duke of Burgoyne. For he entēded in suche wyse to ayde hys partye, yt he trusted in god to brynge the sayde duke to hys due, &amp; conuenyent obeysaūce &amp; subiecciō. But the kyng regarded nothynge the emperours request / but cōcluded a trewys wyth the duke for a yere folowynge, by auctoryte of a great counsayll or parlyament. At the whyche the duke of Alēson was iuged to lose hys hed, &amp; hys heredytamentes to be forfayted vnto the kynge.
                        Than it foloweth in the story / or thys foresayde trewys betwene the kynge &amp; Charles the duke were fully expyred / ye sayd Charles made warre vpon the sayd Lewys, and procured kynge Edwarde of Englande, whose syster he had maryed, to make also warre vpon hym. For expedycyon wherof / the sayd kyng Edwarde landed at Calays shortly after, wyth a competente noumber of soudyours, as after in the .xiiii. yere of the reygne of the sayd Edwarde the .iiii. it shalbe to you more clerely shewed, wyth cō
                           clusyon of a peace &amp; other thynges. After yt which peas betwene the sayd ii. kynges agreed / a vnyte and concorde was also stablysshed betwene thys Lewys &amp; the duke of Burgoyn for .ix. yeres.
                        About the .xvii. yere of thys Lewys / ye steward of Normādy named Lewys Brysey, yt which had maryed the nece of kyng Lewys / beyng warned of ye wāton rule of his wyfe, &amp; of her auoūtry wyth one named Iohn̄ Louyr / vpō a day to proue his sayde wyfe, wēt on hūting / &amp; at his retourn̄ feyned hym wery &amp; feynt for labour, &amp; wēt to his bedde. And she anone demyng her husbād to be at his naturall rest / yode streyght vnto ye chāber of ye sayd Iohn Louyr. wherof ye husbād beyng warned / wyth hys swerde in hāde sped hym vnto ye sayd chāber &amp; after ye dore brokē vp by violēce, &amp; fyndyng thē in bedde or other suspeciouse maner, with his sayde swerde slewe first y• sayde Iohn̄ / &amp; after natwythstādyng

her miserable &amp; lamētable cryēg, &amp; askynge forgyuenes vpō her knees, he also slewher / &amp; after fled tyll he had made hys peace wyth the kyng.

                        whan the sayde lordes were thus departed the lande / the kyng cōmaū
                           ded them to be proclaymed as rebelles and traytours thorugh oute hys realm. And in the Easter weke folowynge / syr Geffrey Gate &amp; one named Claphā, whyche entended at South ampton to haue taken shyppynge &amp; to haue sayled to the sayde lordes, were there taken by the lorde Hawarde and sente vnto warde. whych sayde Clapham was beheded soone after / and the sayde syr Geffrey Gate fande suche frendshyp, that lastly he escaped or was delyuered / so that he yode after to seynt wary.
                        Thanne was the lorde of saynte Iohn̄s arrested. But at instaunce of the archebysshop of Caunterbury, he went a season at large vnder suerty,

and was fynally commytted to the towre. In whych passetyme the erle of Oxenforde gat ouer vnto the foresayd lordes. Thus enduryng thys trouble / a stirrynge was made in the north partyes by the lord Fitz Hugh wherfore the kyng sped hym thyderwarde. But so soone as the sayd lord knewe of the kynges cōmyng / anone he lefte hys peple &amp; fledde into Scotlande. And the kyng whych thā was commyn to yorke, rested hym a season there and there about.
                        In the moneth of Septembre &amp; .x yere of the kyng / the forsayd duke of Clarence accōpanyed wyth the erles of warwyke of Penbroke &amp; of Oxenforde &amp; other many gentylmen, landed at Dartmouth in Deuynshyre / &amp; there made theyr proclamacyons in the name of kyng Henry the .vi / and so drewe ferther into the lāde. wherof herynge the commons of that coūtre &amp; other / drewe vnto theym by greate companyes.
                        Than the Kentyshemen beganne to were wylde / &amp; assembled theym in great companyes, and so came vnto the out partyes of the cytye of London, Rad

                        Thā the foresayde lordes holding on theyr iournaye / drewe towarde ye kynge beyng in the northe as aboue is sayde. wherof he beyng warned, and hauyng wyth hym as than but small strength wherof some to hym were nat very trusty / he wyth a secret company toke the next waye toward the wash in Lyncolneshyre / and there passed ouer wyth great daunger, nat wythout losse of dyuers of hys company / and so passed the coūtrees into Flaunders, and stynted nat tyll he came to Charles hys brother thanne duke of Burgoyne / wyth whome he rested a season. whā the quene which than was in the towre harde of the kynges auoydynge / anone she departed frome thens and yode vnto westmynster, and there regystred her selfe for a seyntwary woman / and in lyke wyse dyd many of kynge Edwardes frendes.
                        And than about the begynnynge of Octobre / syr Geffrey Gate that till that tyme had holden the sayde seyntwary and other wyth hym, wente vnto the prysons aboute London / &amp; all suche as they had fauoure vnto, toke them out and sette them at lybertye. And than shypmen &amp; other euyll dysposed persones as than drewe to the sayd Geffrey Gate / robbed agayn the berehouses, &amp; set some of them in fyre / and after resorted vnto the gates of the cytye, &amp; there wolde haue entred by force. But the cytezeyns wythstode theym wyth suche force, that they were compelled to departe thens.
                        Upon the .xii. day of October, the towre was gyuē vp by appoyntmēt / &amp; kyng Henry was takē from the lodgyng where he before laye, and was than lodged in the kynges lodgyng wythin the sayde towre. In whyche passetyme the duke &amp; the forsayd lordes drewe nere vnto the cytye.
                        And vpon saterday than nexte folowyng / the sayd duke accompanied wyth ye erles of warwyke &amp; of Shrowysbury and the lord Stanley, rode vnto the towre / and there wyth all honour and reuerence fet out kynge Henry, &amp; conueyed hym to Poulys / &amp; there lodged hym in the bysshoppes palays / &amp; so was thā admytted &amp; taken for kyng thorugh all the lande.

But as he was commynge from the sayde place of iugemente toward his execucyon / the people presyd so inportunatly vpon hym for to se &amp; beholde hym, that the sheryfes were fayne to tourne into the Flete, and there to borowe gayoll for hym for that nyght. And vpon the morowe after at afternoone beynge saynt Lukys day and xviii. daye of Octobre / he was ladde to the towre hylle / where he toke his deth full paciently. whose corps was after borne wyth the hedde vnto the blacke freres, and there honourably buryed in a chapell standynge in the body of the churche whych he before tyme had founded.

                        IN thys yere, whyche was in ye ende of the .x. yere of kyng Edwarde, and beginnyng of the readopcion of kyng Henry, that is to meane the thyrde daye of Nouembre / quene Elizabeth beynge as before is sayde in westmynster seyntwary, was lyghted of a fayre prynce. And wythin the sayd place the sayd chylde wythout pōpe was after crystened. whose godfathers were the abbot &amp; pryour of the sayd place, &amp; the lady Scrope godmother. And the .xxvi. daye of the sayd moneth folowyng, began a parlyament / &amp; frome thens proroged to Paulys, where it cōtynued tyll Cristmas. In the parlyamente syr Thomas Cooke before trowbeled as I haue shewed in the .vii. yere of kynge Edwarde, put in a byll into the common house, to be restored of the lorde Ryuers landes &amp; other occasyoners of hys trowble, to the summe of .xxii.M. marke. Of the whyche he hadde good comforte to haue ben allowed of kynge Henry, if he had prospered / and the rather, for that that he was of the commō house, and therwyth a man of great boldnesse in speche and well spoken, &amp; syngulerly wytted &amp; well reasoned.
                        Than durynge thys parlyament / kyng Edward was proclaymed vsurper of the crowne, and the duke of Glouceter hys yonger brother traytour / &amp; both attaynted by auctorytie of the sayd parlyament.
                        And vppon the .xiiii. daye of February, came the duke of Exceter to London. And the .xxvii. daye of ye sayde moneth, rode the erle of warwyke thorugh ye citie toward Douer

for to haue receyued quene Margarete / but he was dyspoynted. For the wynde was to her contrary, that she laye at the see syde taryeng for a conuenyent wynde, from Nouember tyl Apryll. And so the sayde erle after he had longe taryed for her at the see syde / was fayne to retourne without spede of hys purpose.
                        Thus duryng thys queysy seasō / the mayre ferynge the retourne of kynge Edwarde fayned hym syke / &amp; so kepte hys house a great season. All whych tyme syr Thomas Cooke whyche than was admytted to hys former rome, was sette in his place, and allowed for hys deputye / whych tourned after to hys greate trowble and sorowe.
                        Than fynally in the begynnynge of the moneth of Apryll / kynge Edwarde landed in the north at a place called Rauynspore wyth a small cō
                           pany of Flemynges and other, so yt all hys company exceded nat the nō
                           ber of .M. persones / &amp; so drewe hym towarde yorke, makyng hys proclamacyons as he wente in the name of kyng Henry / and shewed to the people, that he came for none entent but onely to clayme hys enherytaunce y• dukedome of yorke / &amp; so passed the countres tyll he came to the cytye of yorke, where the cytezyns helde hym oute tyll they knew hys entent. And whan he had shewed vnto theym as he before had done vnto other, &amp; confermed it by an othe / he was there receyued and refresshed for a certayne tyme, &amp; so departed &amp; helde his waye towarde London / and passed by fauoure &amp; fayer wordes the daūger of the lorde Marquys Mountagu, whyche in that costes laye than in awayte for hym purposely to stoppe hys way, &amp; had people dowble of nō
                           bre that kyng Edwarde had of fyghtynge men. whā kyng Edwarde was thus passed the sayd Marquys, and sawe that hys strength was greatly amended, &amp; that also dayly the peple drewe to hym / he than made proclamacyons in hys owne name as king of Englande / &amp; so helde on hys iournay tyll he came vnto London. In whyche passetyme, that is to meane vpon sherethursdaye / the archebysshoppe of yorke beynge than at Londō wyth kyng Henry, to the entent to moue the peoples hertes towarde ye kyng / rode about the towne wyth hī, and shewed hym to the people / the whyche rather withdrewe mēnes hertes than other wyse. And in thys season also syr Thomas Cooke before-named auoyded the lande / entēdyng to haue sayled into Fraunce. But he was taken of a shyp of Flaunders, &amp; hys sonne &amp; heyre wyth hym / and so sette there in pryson many dayes / &amp; lastly was delyuered vnto kyng Edwarde.
                        Than vpon sherethursdaye at after noone, kynge Edwarde was receyued into the cytye / and so rode to Poulys, and there offered at ye roode of the north dore / and that done yode incontynently into the bysshoppes palays, where he fande kynge Henry almoste alone. For all such lordes and other as in the mornynge were about hym, whan they harde of king Edwardes commynge, anone they fledde, and euery man was fayne &amp; gladde to saue hym selfe. Than king Edwarde lodged hym / where kynge Henry laye, &amp; put hym vnder safe kepynge / and soo rested hym there tyll Easter euyn. Upon the whyche euyn, heryng of hys brothers cōmynge &amp; ye other lordes wyth hym wyth a strōg hoste vnto saynt Albonis / sped hym thyderward, &amp; lay that nyght at Barnet. In whyche season the duke of Clarence contrary hys othe and promyse made vnto the Frenche

kynge refused the tytle of kyng Henry / and sodaynly wyth the strengthe that he hadde, rode streyghte vnto hys brother kynge Edwarde / wherwith the other lordes were somdeale abasshed. The whyche not wythstandynge / the sayd lordes, by the specyall comforte and exortacyon of the erle of Oxenforde as it was sayde, helde on theyr iournay toward Bernet, the sayd erle of Oxenford beyng in the vawarde / and so came vnto ye playne without Bernet, and there pyght theyr felde. Then vpon ye morowe beynge Easter daye &amp; the .xiiii. daye of Apryll very erly, both hostes mette. wherupō that one party were two knyges present, as Hēry the .vi. whych kynge Edward had brought thyder with hym, and kyng Edward the .iiii. And vpon that other partye was the duke of Exceter, the lorde Marquys Mountagu, and the two erlys of warwyke and of Oxenford, wyth many other men of name.
                        There the sayd erle of Oxenforde and his company quyt them so manfully, that he bare ouer that parte of the feeld whyche he sette vppon / so ferforthly ye tydynges came to London, that kynge Edwarde had loste the felde. And yf hys men had kepte theyr araye &amp; not fallen to ryfflyng / lykely it hadde bene as it was after tolde, that the vyctory hadde fallen to that partye. But after longe and cruell fyght, in conclusyon kyng Edwarde optayned the vpper hande, &amp; slewe of hys ennemyes the marques Mountagu and the erle of warwyk hys brother, wyth many other. And vppon the kynges party was slayne the lorde Barnes. And of the comōs vppon bothe partyes were slayne vpon .xv.C. men and mo.
                        Of the mystes and other impedymentes whyche fyll vpon the lordes party by reason of the incantacyons wrought by fryer Būgey as ye fame wēt, me lyst not to wryte. But trouth it is that after thys vyctory thus wonne by kynge Edwarde / he sente the dede corps of the sayd Marquys and erle of warwyke vnto Poulys chyrche / where they laye two dayes after naked in .ii. coffyns that euery man myghte beholde and se theym. And the same after none came kyng Edwarde agayn vnto London, and offered at ye roode of the North dore at Poulys / and after rode vnto westmynster and there lodgyd hym. And soone after that the kynge was thus passed tho▪ ough the cyty, was kyng Henry brought rydynge in a longe gowne of blewe veluet / and so conueyed thoroughe Chepe vnto westmynster, and frome thens vnto the Towre / where he remayned as prysoner all hys lyues tyme after.
                     
                     
                        The repossessyon of Edwarde the .iiii.
                        
                           EDward the .iiii. before named began agayne his domynyon ouer the realme of England, the .xiiii. daye of Apryll, in ye begynnyng of the yere of our lord .M.iiii.C.lxxi / &amp; the .xii. yere of Lewys the Frenche kynge / and reposseded all thynges as he before hadde done. And when the sayde two corps hadde lyen in Poules openly from the Sondaye tyll the Tuysdaye / they were hadde from thens &amp; buryed where ye kynge wolde assygne them.
                        The kynge then beynge in authoryte / made prouysyon for the defence of the landynge of quene Margaret and hyr sonne / the whyche all thys whyle laye at the see syde taryenge the wynde / and so lastely landed at, and came with a strength of Frenchmē &amp; other, as farre within

thē lande as to a vyllage in called Tewkysbury. where the kyng mette wyth her and hyr dystressyd, &amp; chasyd her company and slewe many of them. In the whyche batayle she was taken, &amp; syr Edward her sonne / and so brought vnto the kynge. But after the kynge had questyoned with the sayd syr Edwarde, and he hadde answered vnto hym cōtrary his pleasure / he thenne strake hym wyth hys gauntelet vpon the face. After whiche stroke so by hym receyued / he was by the kynges seruauntes incō
                           tynently slayne vpon the .iiii. daye of the moneth of May.
                        whan kynge Edwarde had thus subdued hys enemyes / anone he sent quene Margarete vnto London, where she restyd a season / and fynally she was sent home into her countre. And the goodes of syr Thomas Cook were agayne ceasyd / and hys wyfe put forth, and commaunded to be kepte at the mayers.
                        Uppon the .xiiii. daye of May folowynge / the bastarde of Fawconbrydge, that vnto hym had gaderyd a ryottous and euyll dysposyd companye of shypmen and other, wyth also the assystence of ye comons both of Essex and of Kent / came in greate multytude vnto the cyty of London. And after that the sayd cōpany was denyed passage thorough the cytye / they set vpō dyuers partyes therof, as Bysshoppes gate, Algate, Londō brydge, and alonge the waters syde, and shotte gonnes and arowes, and fyred the gates wyth cruell malyce, as Bysshops gate and Algate / and faught so fyersly that they wanne ye bulwerkes at Algate, and entred a certayne wythin the gate. But the cytesyus wyth comfort and ayde of Robert Baset alderman assygned to the gate / wythstode the sayd rebelles so manfully, that they slewe all such as entred the gate / and compellyd ye other to drawe a backe and forsoke the gate. Uppon whom the cytesyns pursued / and chased theym vnto the forther Stratforde, and slewe &amp; toke many of them prysoners.
                        wherof herynge the other whyche assayled the other partes of the cytie, fledde in lyke wyse. whom the other cytesyns pursued as farre as Depforde, in sleynge and takyng of them prysoners in great nomber, and after them raunsomed as they hadde ben Frenchemen. And the bastarde with hys shypmē were chasyd vnto theyr shyppes lyenge at Blackwall / and there in the chase many slayne. And the sayde bastarde the nyghte folowynge stale out hys shyppes out of ye ryuer / and so departed and escaped for the tyme.
                        Than vpon Assencyon euyn next ensuynge, the corps of Henry the .vi. late kynge was brought vnreuerently from the tower thorough the high stretes of the cyty vnto Poulys chyrche, and there lefte that nyght / and vppon the morowe conueyed wyth gleyuys and other wepens as he before thyder was brought vnto Chertyssey, and there was buryed.
                        Of the deth of this prince dyuers tales were tolde. But the moste comon fame went, that he was stycked wyth a dagger by the handes of the duke of Glouceter / whyche after Edwarde the .iiii. vsurped the crowne, and was kyng as after shall appere.
                        Than kyng Edwarde after thys victory thus hadde at Tewkesbury, retourned vnto London / and vpon the mondaye folowynge Assencyon daye, he toke hys iournay into Kent, hauyng with hym a strength of people / and there sette hys iustyces, and made inquysycyons of the ryot before done by the bastarde and hys accessaryes. For the whyche at Caunterbury

and other good townes in Kent, dyuers were put in execucyon. Of whom the hedes were sent vnto London, and set vpon the brydge. And in lyke maner inquysyciōs were made in Essex / and some also of them put in execucyon. Of whyche a capytayne named Spysynge was hanged, and hys hede set vpon Algate. And many of the ryche commons of Kent were set at greuous fynes, both for them selfe and for theyr seruauntes. And when the kyng hadde thus spedde his iournaye / he retourned &amp; came to Londō vpon whytson euyn. And that done, soone after was bysshop Neuyll archebysshop of yorke sent vnto Guynes, and there kepte as prysoner longe after. Thys was brother to the lorde marquys Moū
                           tagu and to the erle of warwycke.
                        Also in the ende of thys mayers yere, was the forenamed bastarde of Fawconbrydge taken about Southamton, and there put to execucyō. whose hed was sent to London, and pyght vpon London brydge among other.

And after he hadde so knowen theyr good dysposycion to hym warde / he then sent for the mayre of London and hys brotherne the aldermen, and them seuerally examyned and exorted to ayde &amp; assyst hym toward the sayd iournay.

And after yt he rode about the more parte of the lande, &amp; vsed the people in such fayre maner, that he reysed therby notable sumes of money. The whyche waye of the leuyeng of thys money was after named a benyuolence.
                     Then the kyng thus hauyng this greate substaunce of goodes / made purueyannce for the sayd iournaye. And vppon the .iiii. daye of Iuly folowyng, in the .xv. yere of his reygne rode with a goodly cōpany thorugh the cytye towarde the see syde / and so spedde hym to Caleys, and frome thens into Fraunce. wherof herynge Lewys the French kynge / assembled

hys people in greate nomber, and so spedde hym toward the kynge. But when bothe hostes were met / within shorte space suche offers of a peas were proferyd by the Frenche kyng, that fynally bothe prynces agreed vpon a pease to be had for the terme of both theyr lyues, and a yere after, as some wryters haue. For the perfourmaunce of whyche sayde pease / bothe prynces after met vpon ye day of the Decollacyon of saynte Iohn̄ the baptyste or the .xxix. daye of Auguste, at a place named in Frenche Pynyak / and the .iiii. daye of Nouē

At thys place was a ryuer / vppon the whych a brydge was made such wyse, that bothe prynces theron myght mete, wyth suche company as eyther for them had appoynted. There also was ordeyned a place with a partycyon bytwene both prynces, yt nother of them myghte entre vnto other / but made wyth a lowpe, that eyther myghte se other &amp; take eyther other by the hande.
                     where at the daye lymyted, eyther mette wyth other hostes standynge a certayne distaunce from the ryuers syde in conuenyent araye. Then the sayde kynges there after salutacyon due made, eyther to other had longe cōmunycacyon. In conclusyon wherof, as sayth Gaguyne, a peas was cō
                        fyrmed bytwene bothe realmes for vii. yeres. For perfourmaūce wherof as affermeth the sayde authour / the Frenche kynge gaue vnto kyng Edward incōtinently .lxxv.M. crownes of golde / and yerely after durynge ye sayde .vii. yeres .l.M. crownes. And so he receyued in hande accomptyng euery crowne at .iiii.s.xv.M.li. and yerely after .x.M.li / whych sayde .xv.M.li. the sayd Frēche kyng borowed of his cytesyns of Parys. After thys treuce and peas thus concluded bytwene these two princes / anone after theyr sonderyng, ploclamaciōs were made therof thorough bothe hostes / and commaundement gyuen to the capytayns, that they shulde prouyde for theyr retourne homewarde. And soone vppon the French kynge sent vnto the dukes of Clarence and of Glouceter with other lordes such as were in kynge Edwardes fauour, greate and costyous gyftes. Of the nyse and wanton dysgysed apparell that kyng Lewys ware vppon hym at that tyme of his metyng I myght make a longe rehersall. But for it shulde sownde more to dyshonour of suche a noble man, that was apparayled more lyker a mynstrell thā a prynce royall / therfore I passe it ouer. For all be it yt he was so newfangyll in his clothynge / yet had he many vertues. wherof largesse was one / as it appered by sondy gyftes, which he gaue vnto sōdry straūgers, which in his story somdeale I haue towchyd. And also his bounty apperyd by a gyfte yt he gaue vnto ye lorde Hastynges than lord chāberlayn / as xxiiii. dosen of bollys, wherof halfe were gylt &amp; half whyte / which weyed vpō .xvii. nobles euery cup or more.
                     Thē to retourne vnto kynge Edward / trouth it is yt after ye cōformacyon of ye foresayde peas, kynge Edward returned to Calys &amp; there shypped / &amp; so sped hym yt vpon the .xxviii. day of Septēber folowynge, he was with great tryumghe receyued of the mayre &amp; cytesyns of Londō at Blakheth, &amp; with all honour by them conueyed thorough the cytye vnto westmynster / the mayre and aldermen beynge cladde in scarlet, and the comoners to ye nomber of .v.C. in murrey.

also the reparacyon of the wallys / but not so dylygently as hys predecessour dyd / wherfore it was not sped as it myghte haue bene. And also he was a syke and feble man, and had not so sharpe and quycke mynde as that other had. And one other cause was whych ensueth of a generalyte, that for the more partye one mayre wyll not fynysshe that thynge whych that other begynneth. For then they thynke be the dede neuer so good and profytable, that the honoure therof shalbe ascrybed to the begynner and not to the fynyssher. whyche lacke of charyte and desyre of veyn glory, causeth many good actes and dedes to dye and growe out of mynde, to ye greate decaye of the comon weale of the cytye.

And shortely after the sayd duke of Glouceter inueleged so the archbisshop of Caūterbury named Bowchyer / that he went wyth hym to the quene Elysabeth, and there made suche assured promyse to the sayde quene, that she vppon the sayd archbyshoppes promyse delyuered vnto them her yonger sonne duke of yorke. And than the sayde duke caused the kynge to be remoued vnto the towre, and hys brother with hym.

The The whych incontynently set hande vpon the forenamed lord Chamberlayne and other. In the whyche styrrynge the erle of Derby was hurt in the face and kept a whyle vnder the holde. Than by cōmaundemente of the sayd lorde Protectour / the sayde lord Chamberlayne in all haste was ladde in the court or playn where the chapell of the towre stādeth / &amp; there wythout iugemēt or lōge tyme of cō

                        After whyche cruelte thus done / he shortely after set in sure kepynge suche persones as he suspected to be agayne hym. wherof the bysshoppes of yorke &amp; of Ely were .ii. as it is said And the erle of Derby for fere of hys sonne the lord Strange, lest he shuld haue arered Chesshyre &amp; Lancastershyre agayne hym, was set at large.
                        Than began the lōge couert dyssymulacion, whyche of the lord Protectour had ben so craftly shadowed, to breke out at large / in so moche that vppō the sondaye folowyng at Poules crosse, hym selfe wyth the duke of Bukkyngham &amp; other lordes beyng present, by the mouth of doctor Rafe Shaa in the tyme of hys sermon, was there shewed openly that ye chylderne of kynge Edward the .iiii. were nat legytymat, nor ryghtfull enheritours of the crowne / wyth many dyslaunderous wordes in preferryng of the tytle of the sayd lord Protectour and in dysanullynge of the other / to the greate abucion of all the audiēce, excepte suche as fauoured the mater whyche were fewe in noumbre, yf the trouth or playnesse myghte haue ben shewed.
                        Of the whyche declaracyon as the fame wente after / the sayde doctour Shaa toke suche repentaunce, that he lyued in lyttell prosperytie after. And the more he was wondered of, that he wolde take vppon hym suche a besynesse, consyderynge that he was so famous a man bothe of hys lernynge and also of naturall wytte. Than vppon the tuysdaye folowynge / an assemble of the cōmons of the cytye was appoynted at the

Guyldhalle. where beynge present the duke of Buckynghā wyth other lordes sente downe frome the sayde lorde protectour / and there in the presence of the mayre and comynaltye, rehersed the ryght and tytle that the lorde Protectour hadde to be preferred before hys of hys brother kynge Edwarde, to the ryght of the crowne of Englande. The whyche processe was in so eloquent wyse shewed and vttred wythout any impedyment of spyttynge or other countenaunce, and that of a longe whyle, wyth so great sugred wordes of exhortacyon and accordynge sentence, that many a wyse man that day merueyled and commended hym for the good orderynge of hys wordes, but not for the entent and purpose the whyche theruppon ensued.
                        Uppon the Thursdaye than next ensuynge beynge the .xx. daye of Iuny / the sayde Protectoure takynge then vppon hym as kynge and gouernour of the realme / went wyth great pompe vnto westmynster, and there toke possessyon of the same. where he beynge sette in the greate halle in the See royall, wyth ye duke of Norffolke before called the lorde Hawarde vppon the ryght hande, &amp; the duke of Suffolke vppon the left hande / after the royall othe there taken, called before hym the iudges of the lawe / gyuynge vnto them a long exhortacyon and streyght cōmaundemēt, for ye mynystryng of hys lawes, and to execute iustyce, and that with out delaye. After whyche possessyon takynge, and other ceremonies there done / he was conueyed vnto the kynges palays wythin westmynster and there lodgyd.
                        In whyche passe tyme, the prynce or of ryght kynge Edwarde the .v. wyth hys brother the duke of yorke, were put vnder suer kepynge wythin the towre / in suche wyse that they neuer came abrode after.
                        And thus ended the reygne of Edwarde the .v / when he had borne the name of a kynge by the space of two monethes and .xi. dayes. And vppon the Frydaye beynge the .xxii. daye of Iuny was the sayd lord Protectour proclaymed thorough the cyty kyng of England, by the name of Rychard the thyrde.
                        Then soone after for fere of the quenes blode and other whyche he had in ielousy / he sent for a strength of men out of the North. The which came shortely to London a lytell before hys coronacyon / and mustred in the More feldes well vppon .iiii.M. men in theyr beste iackes and rusty salattes, wyth a fewe in whyte harneys not burnysshed to the sale / and shortely after hys coronacyon were countermaunded home wyth suffycyent rewardes for theyr trauayll.
                        In whyche foresayd passe tyme / ye Marquys of Dorset brother vnto quene Elysabeth yt before was fled, escaped many wonderfull daungers bothe about London, Ely and other places / wherof▪ to wryte the maner &amp; cyrcumstaunce wolde aske a longe and great leysour.
                     
                     
                        Rycharde the thyrde.
                        
                           RIcharde ye thyrde of that name, son to Rycharde late duke of yorke, &amp; yongeste brother vnto Edwarde ye iiii. late kynge / began his domynyō ouer the realme of Englande the .xx. day of mydsomer moneth, in the yere of our lorde god .M.CCCC.lxxxiii. &amp; the .xxv. yere of the .xi. Lewys than kynge of Fraūce. Of whom tedyous

                        Than it foloweth, anone as thys man had taken vpon hym / he fyll in great hatred of the more party of the nobles of hys realm / in so mych that suche as before loued and praysed hym, and wolde haue ieoparted lyfe and good wyth hym yf he hadde remayned styll as ꝓtectour, now murmured and grudged agayne hym / in suche wyse that fewe or none fauoured his partye, except it were for drede or for the great gyftes that they receyued of hym. By meane wherof he wanne dyuers to folow hys mynde / the whiche after deceyued hym.
                        And after his coronacyon solēpnysed, whyche was holden at westmynster the .vi. daye of Iuly, where also ye same daye was crowned dame Anne hys wyfe / he then in shorte processe folowynge rode Northward to pacyfye that countre, and to redresse certayne ryottes there lately done. In the passe tyme of which iournay / he beynge at yorke created hys legyttymat sonne prynce of walys / &amp; ouer that made hys bastarde sonne capytayne of Caleys, whyche encreaced more grudge to hymwarde as after shall appere.

                     IN this yere ye foresayd grudge encreasynge, and the more for as myche as the comon fame wente, that kynge Rycharde hadde within the towre put vnto secret deth ye two sonnes of hys brother Edwarde the iiii. For the whych and other causes hadde within the breste of the duke of Buckyngham / the sayde duke in secrete maner conspyred agayn hym, and allyed hym with dyuers gentylmen, to the ende to brynge hys purpose about.
                     But how it was his entente was espyed and shewed vnto the kynge / and the kynge in all haste sent for to take hym, he then beynge small accō

                     In the whyche passe tyme / kynge Rycharde thynkynge that the duke wolde haue assembled his people, &amp; so to haue gyuen to hym batayle, gathered to hym great strength / and after toke his iournaye westwarde, to haue mette wyth the sayd duke. But whan the kyng was infourmed that he was fledde / anone he made proclamacyons, that who that myght take the sayd duke, shulde haue for a rewarde .M.li. of money / and the value of an hundreth pounde in lande by yere to hym and to hys heyres for euer more. wherof herynge the foresayd Banaster, were it for mede of ye sayd reward, or for the fere of losyng of hys lyfe and good / dyscouered the duke vnto the sheryffe of the shyre / and caused hym to be taken, and so brought vnto Salysbury, where the kynge than laye.
                     
                        And all be it that that the sayde duke made inportune labour to haue commyn to the kynges presence / yet that natwythstandynge, he was beheded vpon the. daye of the moneth of wythout speche or syght of the kynge. Than all suche gentylmen as had apoynted to mete wyth ye said duke, were so dysmayde, that they knewe nat what for to do / but they that myghte fled the lande, and some toke seyntwary places as they myghte wynne vnto theym. But the kyng to the ende to let them of theyr purpose, sente to the see costes and stopped theyr waye in that he myght. And he wyth a certeyne strength rode vnto Exceter / where about that season was takē syr Thomas Selenger knyght, and .ii. gentylmen that one beyng named Thomas Ramme and that other
                     The whyche .iii. persones were there shortly after beheded

And in short tyme after was syr Roger Clyfforde knyght taken aboute Southampton / and from thens sente to the towre of Londō, and after areygned &amp; iuged at westmynster / &amp; frō thens vpon the. daye of drawē vnto the towre hylle.

And lykely it had ben yt he shuld haue so done / had nat ben the quycke helpe &amp; rescous of the sheryffes and theyr offycers.
                        The whyche constrayned hym to lye downe vppon the hardyll / and newly band hym, and so haryed hym to the sayde place of execucion, where he was deuyded in two pecys / and after hys body wyth the hede was conueyed to the fryeres Augustynes, and there be buryed before saynte Katherynes aulter.
                        
                           And in the moneth of February folowynge / dyed Rycharde Chester one of the sheryfes. For whome was immedyatly chosen Raffe Astry, to contynue for that yere folowynge. Kynge Rycharde than ledynge hys lyfe in great agony and doubte / trustynge fewe of suche as were aboute hym, spared nat to spende the greate treasour whych before kyng Edward the .iiii. hadde gadered, in guynge of great &amp; large gyftes. By meane wherof he alonly wasted nat ye great treasour of his sayd brother, but also he was in suche daunger, that he borowed many notable summes of money of ryche men of thys realme, and specyally of the cytezyns of London / wherof the leest summe was .xl.li. for suertye wherof he delyuered to them good &amp; suffycyent pledges.
                        In the whyche passetyme many &amp; sondry gentylmen and diuers sheryffes, departed ouer the see into Fraūce and there allyed them wyth that vertuous prynce Henry sonne vnto the erle of Rychemonde, dyscended lyneally from Henry the .iiii. lately kynge of thys realme / and conuenaunted with hym, that if he wolde mary Elizabeth ye eldest doughter of Edwarde the .iiii, they wolde with goddes help strength hym to be kyng of England &amp; ayde hym in suche maner, that he and also she were or myght be possessed of theyr ryghtfull enherytaunce. Amonge the whyche gentylmen / syr Iamys Blount than keper of the castell of Guynys was one / which with hym conueyed the erle of Oxenford, that longe tofore had ben prysoner wythin the sayd castell.
                        Upon whiche agrement thus concluded / prouysion by them and theyr frendes was made, to sayle into Englande. And after all thynges prepared / the sayd prynce wyth a small cō

                        whyle these foresayde gentylmen of dyuers coostes of Englande escaped as is abouesayde ouer the see / of that affynite was one named wyllyā Colyngbourne taken. And after he had ben holden a season in pryson / he wyth another gentylmā named Turbyruyle were brought vnto Guylde hall, and there areygned. But ye sayd Turbyruyle was repryed to pryson / and that other was caste for sondry treasons / &amp; for a tyme, whyche was layde to hys charge that he shulde make in derysyō of the kyng and his counsayll as foloweth.

For the whyche and other vppon the. day of he was put to ye most cruell deth at the towre hyll, where for him were made a new payer of Galowes / vpon the whych after he had hanged a shorte season, he was cutte downe beynge a lyue, and hys bowellys ryped out of hys bely &amp; cast into the fyre there by hym, and lyued tyll the boucher put hys hand into the bulke of his body / in so moche that the sayd in the same instāt O lord Iesu yet more trouble / &amp; so dyed to the great compassyon of moche people.
                        Than to retourne vnto the noble

The whyche whan he had fynysshed to ye ende, and kyssed the groūde mekely, and reuerently made the signe of the crosse vppon hym / he commaunded suche as were aboute hym, boldly in the name of god &amp; saynte George to set forewarde.
                        whan the landyng of thys prynce was blowen about the lande / many was the man that drewe vnto hym, aswell suche as were in sondry seyntwaryes as other that were abrode / so that hys strēgth encreased shortly. Than the kyng gadered hys power in all haste / and spedde hym in suche wyse, that vpon the .xxii. daye of August &amp; begynnyng of the thyrde yere of hys reygne / he mette wyth the said prynce nere vnto a vyllage in Leycetershyre named Bosworth, nere vnto Leyceter. where betwene theym was foughten a sharpe batayll / &amp; sharper shulde haue ben, if the kynges partie had ben fast to hym. But many towarde the felde refusyd hym, &amp; yode vnto that other partye. And some stode houynge a ferre of, tyl they saw to the whyche partye the vyctory fyll.
                        In conclusyon kynge Rycharde was slayne / and vppon hys partye ye duke of Northfolke before tyme named lorde Hawarde, wyth Brakyngbury Lieutenaunt of the towre, and many other. And amonge other was there taken on lyue the erle of Surrey sonne to the foresayde duke of Northfolke, &amp; sent vnto the towre of London / where he remayned as prysoner longe tyme after.
                        Than was the corps of Rychard late king spoyled, &amp; naked as he was borne caste behynde a man / and so caryed vnreuerently ouertwharte ye horse backe vnto the fryers at Leyceter. where after a season that he had lyen that all men myght beholde him he was there wyth lytell reuerence buryed. And thus with misery ended thys prynce / whych ruled most what by rygour and tyrannye, whan he in great trouble &amp; agony had reygned or vsurped by the space of .ii. yeres .ii. monethes and .ii. dayes.

Than after solempnytie of hys coronacyon ended at the cytye of Raynes, whyche there was solempnised wyth great pompe vpō ye sonday nerte ensuyng the feast of saynt Denys / commissions were sent out into all coostes of hys domynyon, for to enquere of all superfluous giftes gyuen before tyme by hys father / the whyche shortly after were resumed into the kynges handes. And in that season, Olyuer Damman whome Lowys had in many greate romes &amp; offyces set, and by hys dayes hadde hym in synguler loue and fauoure, in so moche as before I haue shewed in the ende of the story of the sayd Lowys, he made a specyall request vnto thys Charles hys sonn̄ that he shuld specyally cherysshe thys sayd Damman / now was appeched of treason wyth one Danyell a Flemynge. The whyche after inquisycyon of theym made / bothe after the lawe of that lande were iuged to deth / and so put in execucyon of hangynge. whose deth of the nobles and astates of the realme was lytell ruyd / consyderyng the rome that he bare by kynge Lowys dayes, and the ignobilitie of his byrth, as an handcrafty mā and barbour. After whose deth a metrycyan compyled these verses folowyng.

After whych vylony to hym done, he was there ryght banysshed the court for euer.
                        And thus two of the moste special and derest beloued seruauntes and counsayllours of kyng Lowys, were shortly after hys deth broughte vnto confusyon.

                              •
                           nny began to moue amōg some nobles of the lāde / in so moche that ye duke of Orleaunce dysdayned, that Anne syster to the kynge wyth suche as she wolde call to counsayll, hadde all the rule about the kyng. wherfore he entendyng to haue the sayde rule, for so moche as he had maryed that other doughter of Lowys / gadered vnto hym strength of knyghtes, purposely to remoue from the kyng such as he lyked / and to sette aboute hym suche persones as he thought conuenyente.
                        But how it was for lacke of wyse orderynge of hys people or other neglygence / at a place called saint Albynys he was taken of hys aduersaryes / &amp; so by the kyng commaunded to pryson to the castel of Byturicēce, where he remayned lōge tyme after. It was nat longe after, that Marymylyan the whych had maryed duke Charles doughter of Burgoyne, gathered hys soudyours to haue releued the foresayd duke of Orleaunce out of pryson / but he preuayled nat. Durynge whyche warre, Fraunceys duke of Brytayn dyed / whose doughter named Anne &amp; enherytour of that duchye, Maxymylyan hadde before trouth plyted for hys lawfull wyfe. wherfore he herynge of the deth of ye sayd Fraunceys / shortely entred the terrytory of Brytayne, and seased it for hys. But Charles with his Frēchmen wythstode hym, by suche force yt he was constrayned to axe helpe of our soueraygne lord kynge Henry ye vii.

After whych vyctory thus opteyned by thys Charles in Brytayn / he made clayme and pretence vnto the lande of Scicilia or Scicilie. And by the exortacion and styrryng of the pope Alexāder the .vi. he wyth a strong hoste entred ye same bothe by lande and by water. To whome was a great ayde the duke of Mylayne / by whose meanes he shortly wan a strōge citie or towne named Campania and diuers other townes and in processe Naples the chyef citie that belonged vnto the kyng of Naples. In so moche that he constrayned Alphounce that than was kynge of Naples and of Scicile to forsake that countre / and so had the dominiō of the more parte of bothe the sayde

countrees. The whyche when he had set in suche order as he thoughte conuenyent / he toke hys iournaye home warde into Fraūce thorough Italy. In whyche passage thys Charlys was beset of the Uenecyans &amp; other Italyans, the whyche entendyd to haue stoppyd hys waye / and metyng wyth hym at a place called in latyne Fornouiences, gaue vnto hym batayle. wherof as sayth myne authour he wan the vyctory to hys greate honour, consyderynge his fewe sowdyours agayne theyr multytude and strength.
                        But to thys sayenge repugne the Italyans dwellyng in London / and say that yf the sayd Charlys had not spedde hym fastly into Fraunce, he had not comen there that yere. But how so it was he eetourned home in sauete.
                        And soone after pope Alexāder foresayd toke such dyspleasure agayne ye sayd Charlys, that he styrred almost all crysten prynces of the worlde agayne hym / he hadde such hatred to the great honoure of ye Frēche kynge as sayth myne authour Gagwyne, yt whyche in all hys werkes extolleth the dedes of Frenchemen forther thā maye be veryfyed in moch of his wrytynge. But what so he wryte of the pope / it is to be demyd that he wolde not take so great partye agayne this Charlys, and exite other prynces to do the same, excepte it hadde ben for great and vrgēt causes / and not for malyce as he affermeth onely.
                        And thus the sayde Gagwyne endeth the story of the sayd Charlys, in the yere of our lorde god .M.iiii.C. xcv / and the .xi. yere of the reygne of the same Charlys thanne presently reygnynge and guydyng the realme of Fraunce / whyche was the .x. yere of our most redoutyd prynce kynge Henry the .vii.
