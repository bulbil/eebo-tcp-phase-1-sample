            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            VNTO THE REVEREND FATHER
in God and honourable Lord, Nicholas Ridley, biſhop
of London, his humble Richard Phinch the vnworthie
miniſter to the ſmall congregation of 
                  •
               aſtham, wiſheth
grace, peace, and health, with increaſe of godlineſſe in Ieſu
the onely health and peace-maker, &amp;c.
            
               AFter I perceiued (very reuerend father)
that your good trauell amongeſt vs had
not ſo good ſucceſſe, as the vnfaithfull &amp;
ſuperfluous doinges of other ſometimes
doe obtaine, I not onely muſed with my
ſelfe what ſhould be the cauſe, but alſo ſtudied with
my whole indeuour to do that lay in me, though not able
to helpe good affaires forward, yet at the leaſt, not
to hinder them. For certaine ouerthwart perſons (pretēding
to cleaue earneſtly vnto the faith of the church,
when in very deed they do nothing els but ſticke vnto
their owne wils in folowing euill cuſtome) coueted diuers
wayes to obſcure the praiſe of your diligent labor.
Being moued thereto partly becauſe you examined thē
by the ſcriptures, and partly for that you gaue in your
viſitation iniunctions to take away the principall monuments
of ſuperſtitions, euen the altars of the popiſh
maſſe.
            Ah God helpe, to be tried by the Goſpel, vvas a
ſtrange matter vnto them that were occupied onely in
their pye portuaſe and ordinalles, but more ſtrange
vnto them that were woont to heare of nothing at viſitations
but of paying of mony, and moſt ſtrange vnto
them that were neuer examined before, not ſo much
as whether they beleeued in God or no.
            This vnwont maner &amp; ſtrangeneſſe made your godly
indeuors, of ſome not to be ſo thankfully receiued (albeit
of the honeſt moſt thankfully taken) as they woorthely
deſerued of all: inſomuch that for my part I
hearkened for nothing but for ſome congratulation of
my brethren toward you: and the people looked for

reformation of enormities, for the open puniſhment
of great crime, and for the plaine ſetting forth of Gods
word &amp; preaching of the ſame after your viſitation. But
as I haue heard nothing of the one (honeſt perſons excepted)
ſo do the people vvait ſtil for the other. Wherfore
(to ſpeake ſimply) I thinke God recompenſeth
the omiſsion of the one vvith the loſſe of the other, for
praiſe hath beene vvont to follovv vertue, as the shadovv
doth the body.
            Furthermore, that noble king of famous memory,
no leſſe prudent then godly minded, king Henry the 8.
put forth vnto vs in the yere of our Lord 1536▪ a booke
of articles, vvherein the ſignification of certaine ceremonies
(vvhich before vvere done) he pl
                  •••…
               ly declared
ſenſing, kneeling, offering to images, &amp; vvorſhiping of
the ſame vvere forbid, and alſo the name of purgitory
vvas cleane taken avvay. But hovv thankefully thoſe
things vvere then of ſome receiued, their ſetting forth
&amp; teaching of the ſame plainly ſhevved. I do vvell remember
that many vvere as loth then to forgoe theyr
purgatory, as they be novv vnvvilling to take dovvne
their altars, the monuments of the ſame: &amp; that it was
as ſtrange a thing to ſay on Aſhvvedneſday Memento
homo, &amp;c. in Engliſh (notvvithſtanding the ſaid booke
of articles vvilling the ſame) as it is novv to be examined
in the Nevv teſtament by a godly biſhop. In the
ſame yere alſo came forth godly iniunctions commanding
parents and gouernours to teach their youth the
Lords prayer, the Articles of the faith, &amp; the cōmandements
of almighty God in English, vvhich themſelues
had not learned, &amp; therfore the curats vvere charged to
recite one clauſe or article one day, &amp; another on another
day of the ſame, vntill the vvhole vvere learned.
This yere likevviſe by the authority of the ſame iniunctions,
the Bible, Gods booke vvas ſet vp in the quiere,
to be read both in Latine and English, vvhich thither
vvas ſo vvell vvelcome, ſo much regarded, and ſo diligently

ſtudied, that he had good leaue to depart from
thence into the body of the church.
            For in the yeare of our Lord God 1538. the magiſtrates
were faine to renew the ſame iniunctions and
ſpeake more plainely, who commanded the ſaid Gods
booke to bee ſet vp in ſome conuenient place in the
Church, and no man to be diſcouraged from reading
of the ſame in Engliſh. They charged all curates againe
to teach the Lordes praier, the articles of the faith, and
the commandementes of God, and that they ſhoulde
examine euerie perſon comming to auriculer confeſsion,
in the ſame, and heare them ſay the Lordes praier,
the articles &amp;c. particularly. And alſo make or cauſe to
be made one ſermon euerie quarter in euerie one of
their cures. O Lord God, what an eye ſore &amp; torment
of minde was this vnto them that were obſtinate and
wayward: but what a ſweete comforte to the ſimple
that were willing to disburden their conſcience? If god
had then, as he hath now, ſent vs ſome godly learned
Biſhops that vvoulde haue taken paines to viſite their
cures, and to haue examined howe theſe matters had
gone forward, they ſhould haue perceaued many a falſe
caſt to haue bin plaied vnder the couerlet in the ſhifting
houſes. And ſome ſimple folke woulde haue ſaide
that their ghoſtles fathers had giuen them counſell to
ſtick vnto their old primer, and to beware of the newe,
and ſpecially of the teſtament.
            Diuers proclamations about this time were alſo ſet
forth, concerning Gods matters, but alas they were ſo
vnwillingly handled, and ſo vnthankfully receaued, that
God had almoſt taken his word from vs againe. At the
length about the yeare of our Lord God 1544. the ſuffrages
were put forth in engliſh, which likewiſe were ſo
wel welcome to ſome that the kings maieſtie then was
conſtrained to write vnto certaine prelates concerning
the ſame, whome he aduertiſed, not to be ſo ſlacke in
putting the ſaid praiers in practiſe, as they were inſerting

forth his former articles &amp; iniunctions. Thus God
hath wrought among vs by a little and a litle to bring
vs to knowledge, that at the lēgth vve might willingly
embrace his holy word. Againe, forſomuch as of late
Gods booke was in ſome places almoſt forgot, in ſome
places runne out of the church into the chancel to hide
himſelfe amongeſt the popiſh bookes, and of ſome ſo
ſafely laid vp, that a man might wright vpon him with
his finger, Ecce nunc in puluere dormio. Therefore almightie
God moued the heart of our moſte naturall
liege Lord and dearely beloued mayden king, to lift vp
the ſame Gods booke once again out of the duſt. Who
in the yeare of our Lord God 1547. ſet foorth by hys
royall viſitation godly homilies, the paraphraſe of that
learned father Eraſmus, to the great comfort of the ſimple
that be willing to learne, &amp; alſo godly iniunctions,
meaning thereby to root vp all ſuperſtition, abuſe, and
idolatry, &amp; to ſet vp gods word in their place. Wherein
he commanded not onely to take awaie all ſuperſtition
and idolatrie, but to take away, and vtterly to
extinguiſh and deſtroy all monuments of ſuperſtition
&amp; idolatrie. cap. 28. But how diligently putoffes haue
practiſed their pollicie, to hinder this his godly purpoſe:
it is better to lament it with teares, then to rehearſe
it in letters. Laſt of all, to put all out of doubt,
and to make a perfect concord, we haue a booke of cō
               mon
praier with an order in the ſame for reading of
Gods booke ſet forth in Engliſh by the ſame aucthoritie,
and ſtabliſhed by act of parliament. And leaſt anie
perſon would be ſo foolish &amp; mad to looke for the romish
ragges againe, one ſtatute at the laſt parliament
abolisheth and condemneth for euer all other popish
bookes of the old ſeruice. Notwithſtanding ſome people
be yet daſed in thoſe Gods matters that they know
not vvhat to doe. Maruaile not therefore (deare father)
though the vngodly ſorte doe miſconſter, and
euill interpret your godly trauaile. For they crie for a

law, they muſt haue a law to lead them from euerie ſuperſtition
by name, els they vvill not obey. But if they
loued obedience, quietneſſe, and had but one ſparke of
reuerend feare either toward God or their prince, or anie
deſire of godly knovvledge, there hath inough and
inough againe bin ſaid, cōcerning matters of religion,
and alſo ſet forth, both by order and law.
            There be articles inough, iniunctions inough, proclamations
inough, commandements inough, exhortations
inough, leſſons inough, and lavves inough, if they
vvere vnderſtoode, vvillingly embraced &amp; reuerently
obeyed. Albeit for them that be ſelf vvilled, frovvard,
contentious, obſtinat, &amp; dul harted, nothing vvil ſerue.
Therfore to none may be better applied this prophecy
of Eſay,
               Eſay. 28. then vnto theſe. Who ſaith, They that be ſuch
muſt haue after one leſſon, another leſſon: after one commandement,
another commandement: after one rule, another
rule: after one inſtruction, another inſtruction: there a
litle, &amp; there a litle. For he that ſpeaketh vnto this people,
is euen as one that vſeth rudeneſſe of ſpeeche, &amp; a ſtrange
language. If anie man ſay vnto them, loe, this is the reſt
wherwith ye may eaſe hym that is wearie, this is the refreſhing,
they will not harken. Therfore the word of the Lord,
leſſon vpon leſſon, commandement vppon commandement,
rule vpon rule, inſtruction vpon inſtruction, there a little,
and there a litle ſhalbe vnto them an occaſion of ſtumbling
that they may goe on, and fal backward, be bruſed, tangled,
and ſnared. Wherefore heare the worde of the Lord, yee
mockers, ye that haue rule of this people. O vvould God
I might haue ouerleapt this ſentēce that goeth before,
that iuſtly novv it might not beſaid. They are out of the
way by reaſon of wyne, yea farre out of the way are they
by reaſon of strong drinke. Theſe things (my moſte reuerend
father) haue inforced me to preſume to doe that
vvhich is aboue the ſtrength both of my vvit and learning,
but not aboue my good vvill, that is, to collect
out of Gods ſcriptures, a ſimple and plaine manifeſtation

of the Church in English, or a manifeſt opening or
shevving of the Church, naming it the Epiphanie, becauſe
that vvord (albeit borrovved of the Grecians) is
frequented already among vs engliſh men in the ſame
ſignification. The obſcuritie, miſunderſtanding and
ignorance onely of this argument &amp; article, hath bene
and alſo is the cauſe of much obſtinacie, contention,
and diſobedience. For vntill it pleaſed almightie God
to open vnto me by his holy ſpirit and vvorde, this article:
credo eccleſiam &amp;c. vvith the right meaning of the
ſame according to the ſcriptures: I vvas as ſtiffe in the
popish traditions (taking them for good cuſtomes and
ceremonies of the fathers) as I am now earneſt in Gods
booke, and taught them vvith ſo good a zeale (but not
according to knovvledge) as I doe novv the Goſpell.
Wherefore taking of the ſame remedy vvherof I tooke
hurt, euen of Credo eccleſiam, as they that be hurt of
ſcorpions be vvoont to do, I can do no leſſe but vvrite
and ſet forth the ſame, vnto and for ſuch as be ſtoong
vvith the ſame ſting, and venomed vvith the ſame poiſon.
Whoſe nature is, not to hurt but vvhere it findeth
bloud. No more Credo eccleſiam hurteth but ſuche as
cleaue too much to humaine reaſon and naturall vvit.
I truſt they vvill not miſlike that thing that loue conſtraineth
me to doe for their ſakes. If they doe, they
shall find me as readie to defend the ſame by the word
of god againſt all popish bablinges, as I haue bene to
vvrite it. So that your godly learning miſliketh it not,
vnto vvhome vvith all other godly learned, I humbly
ſubmit the ſame, beſeeching you to accept in good
part my ſmall induſtrie, as the firſt fruites of my pen
and iudge thereof as god shall put in your minde, to
vvhome be all thanke, praiſe and glory. Amen.

CHVRCH.
            
               BEcauſe I couet rather to
profite with homely and
playn ſpeech, then to pleaſe
with ſweete &amp; faire words:
I will ſpeake liberally, but
yet ſimply of the Church,
for their ſakes, and vnto
them that be deceaued with
euill cuſtome, bewitched
with popiſh iuglings, charmed
with mens inuentions, and beguiled with their owne
wittes, which reſiſt the trueth of Gods holy word, kicke againſt
the pricke, and grope at noone, and cannot ſee the
light for the ſunne: In whoſe mouth is euer Churche,
Church, whoſe feete are dayly wandring vnto the church,
and their eyes gaſing continually vpon the Church, yet can
they neyther finde nor ſee the Church, becauſe themſelues
be none of the Church.
            What is ſo much alleadged of the babling papiſtes?
what ſo oft frequented of the common people? and ſo manifeſt
in all mens eyes, as the Church? Notwithanding
for want of teachers of the Scriptures, few doe know the
Church: Such is the knowledge among the ſilly people,
in verie manie Churches now a dayes.
            Church in the Engliſh Bible,Church hath diuers ſignifications. is commonly called congregation,
For eccleſia a worde borrowed of the Greeke
toonge, which may be tranſlated into Engliſhe, eyther
Church or congregation.
            Church with vs, is a common worde, ſignifiyng the

place,Church ſignifieth the place of praier. as well as congregation,Iudith, 6. whereunto the ſame aſſembleth
for ſome honeſt or godly purpoſe. It is written that
all the people were gathered togither, which made
their prayers all the night long in the Church. Our
common places appoynted for prayer, preaching, and adminiſtration
of the ſacraments, be ſo well knowne by this
name Church, that there needeth no example hereof.
            Other whiles Church ſignifieth the whole multitude of
people,Church ſignifiyng the companie of good and bad. both of good and bad congregate togither. Of this
we read, that the people ſpake to Moyſes, ſaying, Why
haue you brought the Church of the Lord vnto this
wilderneſſe, that both wee and our cattell ſhould die
in it.
               Numb. 20.
            
            
               And Church betokeneth the elect people of God onely,
whereof the wiſe man ſayth,
               Church ſignifiyng the elect of God onely. The children of wiſedome
are the Church of the righteous, and their exerciſe is
obedience and loue. Holy Paul ſpeaking of this Church
ſaith,
               Eccleſ 3. Ye husbandes loue your wiues,Epheſ, 5. euen as Chriſt alſo
loued the Church, and gaue himſelfe for it, to ſanctifie
it, and clenſed it in the fountaine of water, thorow the
word to make it vnto himſelf a glorious congregation
without ſpot or wrinckle or any ſuch thing, but that it
ſhould be holy and without blame.
            Alſo there is a congregation of the wicked,Eccleſia ſignifiyng the mulitiude of the wicked. called by
the name of Churche,Pſalm. 26. which (for that they outwardly
profeſſe the ſame religion, pretend to haue the ſame goſpel,Eſay. 3.
and to vſe the ſame ſacramentes with the Church) be called
in Scripture,Math. 21. Church,Iohn. 5. whome God permitteth ſometimes
to rule ouer the people for their ſinnes: For the vngodlineſſe

               2. Theſſ 2.
            
            Wherefore they that crie ſo much, the Churche, the
Church, and affirme ſtiffely that the Church cannot erre,
and doe not declare what Church they doe meane, doe but
caſt a miſt before the ſimple vnlearned peoples eyes, to
blind them withall, to the end themſelues might the cleaner

conuey their iugling caſtes. Let them therefore (in Gods
holy name) ſhew vnto vs plainly in ſimple wordes, what
Church they doe ſpeake of, whether of the Churche of
Chriſt, or elſe of the Churche of Antichriſt. So doing
men will be out of doubt the ſooner, trueth will come to
light, and brawling will ceaſe, for verie Chriſtians loue not
contention.
            The Church of Antichriſt,Churche of Antichriſt. which is worthily called the
Church malignant, or the congregation of the wicked, and
may be called the man of ſinne, childe of perdition, hypocrite,
&amp;c. cannot but erre, what fayre ſhewe ſoeuer they
make.
            The Church of Ieſus Chriſt,Church of Ieſus Chriſt. which is his onely doue
and ſpowſe, ſticking vnto the word of trueth, vnſeparable,
and gouerned by his holy ſpirite, cannot erre damnably,
although ſhe be trode downe vnder feete of the world, and
ſeeme to be out of countenance.
            Theſe two be contrarie the one to the other, betweene
whome there is as much difference, as is betweene ſower
and ſweete, darkeneſſe and light, euill and good. Notwithſtanding
the world (not able to perceaue the difference, nor
make diſtinction betweene them, but blinded with euil cuſtome
and the multitude) taketh them for the other, becauſe
here in this life they be mingled togither as the good fiſhes
are mixt with the bad, the goates with the ſherpe, and
the chaffe with the corne, ſo that they be not openly known
vnto men at the firſt ſight.2. Cor. 11. No maruaile, for Sathan himſelfe
is changed into the Angel of light, and his miniſters
faſhion themſelues, as though they were the miniſters
of righteouſneſſe. Alſo woolues clothe themſelues
in Sheepes clothing.
               Math. 7. Yet is Sathan a deuill ſtill, and hys
miniſters are deceiptfull workers, and a woolfe a deuourer
of ſheepe, which at length bewrateth himſelfe by his taile,
and bloudſhedding. Whereas the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt is
knowne by the ſpirite of trueth, and by paciently ſuffering
for his word.
            
               
Which ſpirit &amp; word be the ſure anchors, guids, and rule of
the ſame, and not Rome, nor Peter, though Sathan pretendeth
neuer ſo antient a title.
            If Chriſt had appoynted his Churche to anie place
or creature, for the eſtabliſhing of matters of Religion,
ſhould Paul (that elect veſſell of God,2. Cor. 12. which was
rapt vp into the third heauen, and into paradiſe, and heart
ſecret wordes which no man can vtter) haue bene ignorant
thereof: Paul knewe well that Chriſt had left his Church
vnto his holy ſpirite and word, his word to be an infallible
rule both of their life and doctrine, and his ſpirite to be a
readie interpreter of the ſame. Therefore when hee ſhould
depart from them,Act. 20. he ſaid. Nowe brethren I commend
you to God, and vnto the word of his grace, which is
able to build further, and to giue you an inheritance
amongeſt all them that are ſanctified. Theſe wordes
are without guile and ſophiſticall craft, they are ſimple and
playne, and Gods Scriptures. We muſt therefore beleue
them. They ſend vs vnto the port of ſafegard, and touchſtone
that cannot deceiue vs, we muſt needes therefore ſtick
vnto thē, otherwiſe we cannot know the trueth &amp; be ſaued.
            Wherein firſt let vs conſider why Paul did ſend vs vnto
God the holy Ghoſt For he ſaith, Nowe brethren I
commend you to God. Hee commendeth vs not vnto
Iohn, Peter, Andrew, or any other of the Apoſtles, much
leſſe vnto Rome, the Pope or Antichriſtian Biſhops, but
vnto God the holy Ghoſt, Why? Becauſe hee knew well
that Chriſt himſelfe had ſo appointed before. For when
Chriſt ſhould depart from the church, he promiſed to ſend
them the ſame holy Ghoſt,Iohn. 14. ſaying. The comforter which
is the holy Ghoſt, whome my father will ſend in my
name, hee ſhall teache you all thinges, and bring all
thinges vnto your remembrance, whatſoeuer I haue
ſaid vnto you. He comforted them alſo vvith the ſame
ſpirite,
               Iohn. 15 16. Commaunded them to tarrie in the citie of Hieruſalem
vntill he had performed the ſame his promiſe:Luke. 24. which

indeede he ſaythfully kept and fulfilled, for they were all filled
with the holy Ghoſt,Act. 2. euen the ſpirite of trueth,Iohn. 15. whiche
could not but teach them all trueth, whatſoeuer he had ſaid
vnto them, that was all one, and the ſame trueth.
            Secondly let vs note, that Paul commended the Church
vnto the word of grace, what is this word of grace? Forſooth
the ſame trueth which the holy Ghoſt taught, is the
word of grace, euen that word which God the father commanded
to be heard at the m
                  •
               uth of his ſon Ieſus Chriſt,
ſaying:Math. 3 17. 
               This is my welbeloued ſonne,
               Deut. 18. 
               in whome I am
well pleaſed, heare him. And whoſoeuer will not harken
vnto the wordes, which hee ſhall ſpeake in my
name, I will require it of him: I will be reuenged of
him (ſaith God) Of this, witneſſeth Peter alſo, laying
The time will come Paul
                ſaith (Behold nowe is the
time) that euerie ſoule which vvill not heare him,
               Acts. 3.
               ſhalbe deſtroyed from amongeſt the people.
               2. Cor. 6.
            
            It ſtandeth vs then in hand to ſearche diligently, and
knowe that thing that God requireth ſo ſtraightly of vs,
which is to heare his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, The neglecting
whereof is no leſſe then damnation.
            
               But what ſhall we heare? verily his holy Goſpel confirmed
for vs by his holy ſpirite for the ſame purpoſe,
               Goſpel. 
               which
Goſpell is the worde of grace,Act. 20. vndefiled, conuerting
ſoules, giuing wiſedome vnto babes, making glad
harts, giuing light vnto the eies, a lantorn vnto the feet,Pſal. 18.
and a light vnto the pathes,Pſal. 119. proued by the fire &amp; tryed
more pure then ſiluer vii.Pſal. 11. times purged, more to be deſired
then golde or pretious ſtone,Pſal. 18. and ſweeter then
honie and honie combe,Pſal. 119. The embaſſage of great ioy,Luke. 2.

poure of God vnto ſaluation to euerie one that beleeueth,Rom. 1. and able to ſaue their ſoules that imbrace it.1. Cor. 1. Wherefore lay apart (ſayth the Apoſtle Iames) all filthineſſe
and ſuperfluitie of maliciouſneſſe,Iames. 1. and receaue
with meekeneſſe the worde that is grafted in you,

which is able to ſaue your ſoules.
            Thus it appeareth manifeſtly vnto all them that be
willing to ſee the trueth, that God the father appoynteth
vs vnto the worde of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.
Chriſt referreth vs vnto his holy ſpirite and trueth. The
holy Ghoſt alſo taught nothing elſe but the ſame trueth
and word. Therefore the holy Apoſtle durſt not to appoint
vs to anie other, but ſtraightly commendeth vs to the ſame
trueth that cannot erre, and vnto the word of grace, which
is the ſelfe ſame, and ſtill one trueth, according to the infallible
word of God, that ſaith: Thy righteouſneſſe (O Lord)
is an euerlaſting righteouſneſſe,
               Pſal. 119. 
               and thy lawe is the
trueth. So that we haue now in this time iuſt cauſe, ioyfully
to ſay with the prophet.Pſal. 17. 1. 2. 
               O praiſe ye the Lord, all ye
heathen praiſe him all ye people. For his mercie is ſtabliſhed
vpon vs, and the trueth of the Lord endureth
for euer. Then the which trueth, there can be no ſurer
ſtay, guide, and rule, for the beliefe, life and doctrine of mortall
men, in this mortall life, and world of tribulation.
            
               The Church of Antichriſt hath no ſuch ſtay,

the holy place and aduerſary, whoſe mouth is full of
curſing and bitterneſſe, their throat is an open ſepulcher,
with their toonges they haue deceiued,Pſal. 4 the poyſon
of aſpes is vnder their lippes,Pſal. 6. their feete are ſwift to
ſhed bloud, deſtruction and vnhappineſſe is in their
waies, and the way of peace haue they not knowne,
there is no feare of God before their eies, There were
they brought in great feare,Pſal. 14. euen where no feare was.

               Vaine perſons and deceiptfull lippes, whom euer all good
men abhorred and hated, after the example of the holy prophet,
who ſaith,
               Pſal. 26. I haue hated the Church of the vvicked,
and will not ſit among the vngodly.
            Loe you ſee the wicked and vngodly haue the name of
Church, yea they haue got the name of holy Catholicke
Church. How elſe haue they put on ſheepes clothing? How
haue they faſhioned themſelues like the miniſters of righteouſneſſe?
And howe hath the deuill tranſformed himſelfe
into the angel of light? Truely in this, that his church hath
got the titles of holy, and Catholicke, and his miniſters the
names of true ſhepheardes. Catholicke be the right clothing
of the ſheepe of Chriſtes fold. Antichriſt therefore
hath robbed Chriſtes fold of their right title, holy and catholicke,
and thereby bleared the eyes of the ſimple vnlearned
multitude, which doe ſeeke no further for ſaluation
then they haue bene taught (they ſay) by the holy Catholicke
Church. Their common ſayinges be theſe. We be not
wiſer then our fathers before vs: We will doe as our fathers
haue done. Such thinges they doe affirme becauſe
they know not Sathan from the angell of light, the wolues
from the ſheepe, the lyes from the word of God, neyther
Church of Antichriſt falſly called holy, and catholicke, from
the Church of Ieſus Chriſt, which indeede is both holy
and catholicke. But in ſtead of the holy Catholick church,
they doe beleeue the Church of the wicked, in whoſe dregs
of deteſtable traditions and ceremonies, they haue bene
ouſted from their youth.
            Verely if they would ponder their wordes with halfe
indifferent iudgement, and behold them but with one of
their eyes, I thinke they would keepe ſilence, or elſe bluſhe
for ſhame. For to ſay, they will doe as their elders and fathers
haue done before them, is nothing but to confeſſe thē
               ſelues
to walke wilfully in errour and blindneſſe, when
their fathers wandered vnawares. And where they ſay,
they be no wiſer then their fathers, they ſhew themſelues

to be blinde, followers of the blinde, But if the blinde follow
the blinde,
               Luke 6. 
               they both fall into the ditch. Their fathers
tooke Antichriſt, the biſhop of Rome, for head of the
Church: they made images and worſhipped them: they
gadded on pilgrimage, and truſted in workes, pardons,
abſolutions, dirges, trentalles, maſſes, &amp;c. wherein they
erred, increaſed in error, and walked ignorantly into perdition.
The cauſe whereof was the lack of the word of God,
which word is euer a rule vnto the holy catholicke church.
Therefore their fathers learned not theſe thinges of the
holy Catholicke Church, but of the Church of Rome vſurping
the name of the holy Catholicke Church, which abhorred
and trode vnder feete the word of God, without the
which, their fathers doctrine was nothing els, but olde errour,
againſt whome God giueth a ſpeciall commandement,
ſaying.Leuit. 18. 
               Keepe my commandementes: doe not
thoſe thinges that other haue done before you: be not
defiled in them, I am your Lord your God. Wherefore
addeth God theſe words,Exod. 20. 
               I am your Lord your God,
but to the end he would haue his words regarded for euer?
and not his aduerſaries the man of ſinne, and childe of perdition,
as Paul nameth him, who deceaued their fathers.
Whoſe coming is after the vvorking of Sathan vvith al
lying povvers,
               2. Theſſ. 2. 
               ſignes &amp; vvonders, &amp; with al deceiuableneſſe
of vnrighteouſneſſe amongeſt them that periſh,
becauſe they receaued not the loue of the trueth, that
they might be ſaued, And therefore God ſhal ſend them
ſtrong deluſion, that they might beleue lyes, that all
they might be damned which beleeued not the trueth,
but had pleaſure in vnrighteouſneſſe.
            
            In theſe wordes hath the holy Ghoſt plainly ſhewed
the faſhion and comming of the man of ſinne, ſonne of perdition,
Church of the wicked, and kingdome of Antichriſt.
            The Church or kingdome of Antichriſt, is called the
man of ſinne,
               The man of ſinne. becauſe it is builded vpon a ſinnefull man,

gouerned by a ſinfull man, inſtructed by euill ſinfull workmen,
and their doctrine defended by the lawes and power
of ſinnefull men. Which tooke authoritie neyther of God,
nor of his worde, but of a monſtrous beaſt with many
heades, euen of the people that departed from the faith,
whereof the ſame holy ſpirite of God ſpeaketh, and prophecieth
more plainely by the mouth of Paul, ſaying: The
ſpirite ſpeaketh euidently,
               1. Tim. 4. 
               that in the latter times ſome
ſhall depart from the faith, and ſhall giue heede vnto
the ſpirites of error, and deuiliſh doctrines of them
which ſpeake falſe, thorow hypocriſie, and haue their
conſcience marked with an hote iron, forbidding to
marrie, and commaunding to abſtaine from meates
vvhich God hath created to be receaued vvith giuing
of thankes, of them which beleeue and knevve the
trueth.
            
            Now ioyne theſe two prophecies together, and note diligently
the cauſe, maner, increaſe, and force of Antichriſts
kingdome: and then it ſhall be the better perceaued.
            The cauſe why God permitteth the wicked to deceiue
the people,The cauſe why God ſuffered error to raigne, and the wicked to rule. was for that they did not receaue the law of the
trueth, but loathed Gods word when they had it. They
writ it not in their heartes, neither brought forth the fruits
of the ſpirite, but of the fleſh. To ſpeake all in one worde,
They had (as we haue) much godly teaching, and brought
foorth much vngodly liuing. Of verie duetie godly liuing
muſt followe godly teaching, otherwiſe Gods plague and
vengeance followeth his word, where and when ſoeuer it
be taught.
            But amongeſt all the plagues of God,The greateſt plague of God. this is the greateſt,
that he taketh away his word from the people, and ſuffereth
them to be fed with lies and Canterburie tales, or
fables. After which ſorte and maner the wicked haue come
and entered into the Chriſtian generation,By lyes the wicked haue entered into the Church. yea and haue
ſit in the holy place and ſeate of Moyſes, pretending to
teache the holy word of God. They haue ſet (I ſay) in the

ſeate of Moyſes, not by teaching the law and the prophets,
but by name and place. whereby the people not able to diſcerne
the true ſeſſion from preſumptuous vſurpation haue
bene deceiued with falſe myracles, lying powers and wonders.
            By the which feates they haue increaſed and growne
into the greater number.By falſe miracles &amp; lying
powers, the wicked haue increaſed. For when by the helpe of the
deuill, with their coniurations, charmes and diuers other
falſe fleightes, they wrought myracles and wonders in
diuers and ſundrie places. Then the people (regarding not
the ſimple word of God) forſooke their faith and ranne a
gadding from place to place, to gaze vpon ſignes and wonders.
Manie beleeued lies, becauſe many taught lies. Lying
powers were on their ſide, few durſt ſpeake the trueth,
and the ſimple lacked good inſtruction, ſome therefore departed
from the faith.
            The ſorce of Antichriſtes kingdome is well noted of
Paul,
               By force the wicked haue withſtood the trueth and ſet forth their owne doctrine. in that hee ſaith his comming ſhalbe with all lying
power,1. Tim. 4. &amp; in that they ſhall forbid mariages, &amp; command to
abſtaine frō meats, and &amp;c. yt is to ſay After that the multitude
hath bin well pampered and fed with their lies, blinded
with their coniurations, and ſtabliſhed with falſe miracles:
then ſhall they be able to make lawes in the defence
of their deuiliſhe doctrines, and openly to withſtand and reſiſt
the trueth and Goſpel, as Iannes and Iambres (Pharaoes
coniurers) withſtoode Moyſes. Men they are
                (ſayth
Paul) of corrupt mindes,
               
               2. Tim. 3. 
               and lewd as concerning
faith.
               2. Pet. 2. 
               Peter witneſſeth with Paul, ſaying: They ſhall
purely bring in damnable ſects euen denieng the Lord
that hath bought them, &amp; bring vpon themſelfes ſwift
damnation, &amp; many ſhal follow their damnable waies,
by whome the way of trueth ſhall be euill ſpoken of.
            
            
               No maruaile,
               Hipocriſie Hindeth the ſillie multitude. 
               for hypocriſie and outward ſhew of holyneſſe
hath ſeemed ſo gay in the ſimple folkes eyes,
               Math. 24. 
               yea and
yet doth to ſome, ſo that as the trueth ſaith, if it were poſſible,
the verie elect ſhould be deceiued. Iude alſo beareth

record to the trueth with Paule and Peter,
               Sure notes of Antichriſtes generation. ſhewing
that they be deceaued with dreames,Iude 1. defile the fleshe,
deſpiſe rulers, and ſpeake euill of them that be in authoritie,
murmurers, complainers, walking after their
owne luſtes, whoſe mouthes ſpeake proud thinges.
Theſe (ſaith he) are makers of ſectes, fleshly, hauing no
ſpirite.
            Conferre theſe ſame now together with the popiſh antichriſtian
church of Rome, and beholde if you can ſee the
kingdome of Antichriſt anie where ſo manifeſt and plaine.
            Hath anie power in all the world,The firſt note of Antichriſt. ſince Chriſtes aſcention
into heauen lift vp it ſelfe ſo high into the temple of
God, and aduanced it ſelfe as God, like vnto this vſurped
premacie and tyrannie of Rome?
            Who hath more oppreſſed Gods booke,The ſecond note of antichriſt. reſiſted the
Goſpel,The third note of antichriſt. and ſlandered the way of trueth then the pope and
his rable? Who hath wrought with ſuche deceaueable
ſignes and myracles? who hath fed vs with more lyes
then that falſe prophet of Rome? Read a leafe or two of
Legenda aurea, or the booke called Feſtinale, and you ſhal
finde good ſtuffe I warrant you. Which bookes were
woont to be read and taught vs moſte principally concerning
matters of religion. Yea, almoſt wee had no other in
Engliſh. I ſpeake that I haue knowne, heard and ſeene.
Within theſe xxiii. yeares they were alledged in Sermons
and read in the churche openly, and had in more price amongeſt
vs, and better receaued then the holy Scriptures
be of ſome. Alſo they were then better ſtudied and more
willingly taught of curates, in ſome places then Gods
booke is now of manie of them.
            Forget not I pray you,Antichriſtes badges. to call to memorie, how we were
deceiued with images, pilgrimages, reliques, falſe myracles,
iuglinges, charmes, witchcraftes, coniurations, iubilies,
ſtations, holy water, fire, aſhes, palmes, palme croſſes,
ſaint Iohns Goſpel, images of waxe, Walſinghame
broches, ſaint Iames ſhelles, ſaint Priarke his ſtaffe, maiſter

               Iohn Shornes bat, ſaint Cornelius horne, pardons,
pardon beades, beades, Ladies Pſalters, dyrges, treutals,
Requiem Maſſes, &amp;c. Who denied the Lord that had
bought then more manifeſtly then they that taught theſe
romiſh dreames?
            Whoſoeuer denieth the death of Ieſus Chriſt to be a
whole perfect oblation,The finall end of Antichriſts iuglinges. ſufficient for all ſinne, denyeth the
Lord that hath bought them. But they that taught or beleeued
the aforeſaid dragges and ſuch like to be expedient for
the obtaining of Gods fauour &amp; remiſſion of ſins, denieth
Chriſt and his death to be ſufficient. Wherefore ſo long
as men ſought remiſſion of ſinnes and Gods fauour in
ſuch phantaſticall deuiſes of men, it cannot be denyed, but
in ſo doing, they denied the Lord that bought them.
            To ſay trueth, men little remembred the oblation of
Chriſt by deathe vppon the croſſe. For not manie yeares
agone, euen when Maſſes ſatiſfactory floriſhed, to affirme
Chriſtes oblation by death vpon the croſſe once offered for
all, to be ſufficient for remiſſion of ſinnes to all them that
beleeue, was ſo farre out of memorie that it was counted
abhominable hereſie, becauſe Maſſe and it could not ſtand
together. In time of anguiſhe, trouble, or ſickeneſſe, was
Chriſtes death ſought to for quietneſſe of conſcience? No,
our Lady of Wilſdon, our Lady of Walſingham, maiſter
Iohn Shorne, and confeſſion to ſome holy fryer, ſome holy
relique, Maſſe of Recordare, or maſſe of the v. wounds: For
vnto theſe maſſes, biſhop Clement, and Biſhop Boniface
had giuen great vertue through pardons and candels, if
the deuill tranſforming himſelfe vnto Raphael the arch-angel,
be a true meſſenger.
            Alſo if death approched, then was Maſſe of Scala coeli,
Trentals, Aniuerſarijs, and maſſe of Requiem with our
Lady Maſſe ready to be ſold for mony, and ſong to ſend the
ſoule to the Deuill with mirth, becauſe hee might be ſure
of weeping and gnaſhing of teeth when hee commeth
there.The fourth note of Antichriſt. Yet did not the poore ſillie people ſelling their owne

ſoules to the deuill, and giuing their monie vnto his miniſters,
perceaue that they were made a marchandiſe: whereof
prophecied Peter, ſaying. Thorovv couetouſneſſe shall
they vvith fained words,
               2. Pet. 2. 
               make a marchandiſe of you.
The onely wifeleſſe life of the Romiſh anointlinges, ſo bewitched
the vnlearned peoples eyes,The thing that blinded the people moſt. that they ſtoode in admiration
of them (iudging them more then men) and
thought all had bene well, whatſoeuer they had ſayde or
done.
            To keepe this their eſtimation in the peoples opinions,The cauſe why Antichriſtes prelates will not permit the mariages of prieſtes.
they procured their champions to fight manfully with their
lawes and tormentes againſt the mariages of prieſtes. And
nowe that they doe perceaue that force will not ſerue them,
they priuily whiſper in the eares of the people that mariage
is whoredome and an vncleane life: Whereby they do condemne
all honeſt married perſons of adulterie, yet doe not
manie fooliſh people perceaue,If marriage be not a cleane life, God is the author of vncleanneſſe, and Chriſt a bawd. how they (that teache ſuch
hereſie and diueliſhe doctrine) goe about to lowt them in
their liuing. For they are not aſhamed to make God the
author of vncleanneſſe, to accuſe Chriſt of bawdrie, and to
condemne all men of ſinne, ſo that themſelues might ſtill be
counted angels, and not men.
            This do all they that ſpeake thus euilly of matrimony,
Whereof God himſelfe was the author. And Chriſt honoured
it both by his corporall preſence,Gen. 2. Math. 19. Iohn. 2. and firſt myracle
turning water into wine: whereby he declared, that the wel
alowed matrimonie and condemned adulterie.
            But theſe fellowes diſalowing Gods inſtitution, and
aduaunſing their owne inuention, turne wine into water
contrary vnto Chriſt, that is to ſay, They diſhonour holy
matrimonie,Vnto God matrimonie is ſweete, But vnto Antichriſt whoredome is holy. which is ſweete and pleaſant in the ſight of
God, and make much of ſtincking adulterie euer abhorred
and condemned of God and all good men. They admit rather
an harlot for money diſpenſed withall contrarie to the
commandementes of God, then a wife according to Gods
ſcriptures,1. Cor. 7. which ſayth, If they cannot abſtaine, let them

marrie, yea ſome of them are not aſhamed to ſay that it is
more lawfull for a prieſt to haue ſix whores then one wife.
And ſome alſo pretend ſo good fellowſhip, that they would
ſooner lend their owne wiues (they ſay) vnto the Prieſt,
then to grant that he ſhuld marrie. Alſo they count it a deed
of charitie, and a good worke to make a prieſt a cookold,
(as they terme it) and in ſo doing, they think to pleaſe God
and doe him good ſeruice.
            Whether a man might beleeue them in theſe their
ſayinges without an othe.Antichriſtes prelates doe hope by the increaſing of ſinne, to bring the word of God in hatred and them ſelues in eſtimation. I leaue it for other men to
iudge. Of this I am ſure, that this their cupſhot doctrine
brawled in their conuenticles, and whiſpered in corners,
their liberall fellowſhip, and good worke that proceedeth of
their burning concupiſcenſe, &amp; not of charitie, hath brought
in the contempt and violating of holy matrimonie, and the
people to a wonderfull looſeneſſe of liuing. Wherein they
ioy not a little, thinking it to be a good meane to ſet them
vp againe like Gods in mens conſciences. But in the
meane while they ſhal be deuils and ſpirites of error according
to the prophecie of Paul before ſaid,1. Tim. 4. in that they doe
forbid the mariage of prieſtes.
            Alſo, who hath brought in ſo manie ſectes into ye world
as theſe romiſh wraklinges haue done.The fift note of Antichriſt. Of which ſorte be
theſe, Moonks, Chanons, Friers, Prebendaries, Canons,
Nuns, Siſters, Auckars, hermites, brother hoods, bawds,
beades-men I ſhould ſay, fraternities, craftily naming thē
holy religious. How theſe haue bin deceiued wt dreams &amp;c.
I appeale to their owne conſceence. Let them take heede
that it be not marked with the hote iron of burning concupiſcence.
If it be, I leaue them this alſo for a token of
their maiſters marke,The carracter of Antichriſt. to make them knowne by, euen that
they burne in malice againſt al them that ſpeake the trueth.
            If you aſke me to what purpoſe this rable ſerueth, and
what good they doe in the publike weale of the Lord: Forſooth
I muſt deſire the prophet to make anſwere for me,
who ſaith, They are not in the trauaile of men, neyther

are they plagued like other folk. Yes ſir, they take great
paines in prayer and in maſſing.The occupation of Antichriſts brood. Pſal. 83. 73. Of whome therefore it
may be more truely ſpoken, as followeth. They ſtretche
forth their mouth vnto heauen, and there toonge goeth
through the worlde. Therefore fall the people vnto
them: and thereout ſucke they no ſmall aduauntage.
Beholde theſe ſinfull and wealthie men in the world,
haue obtained riches. Loe theſe be the mouthes that
ſpeake proud thinges, before rehearſed.
            What prouder thinges can be ſaide, than to affirme
that they can with fine words create their creator of a peece
a bread,The ſixt note of Antichriſt. and offer him for the ſinnes of the people, when
they haue done. Whereby they haue ſucked no ſmall lucre
and game from the people. But their lucre beginneth now
to decay, and their idle life is perceaued to be vnnereſſary.
Which idle life, the God that they doe make hath and muſt
maintaine, or els they will perceiue their ſtate cannot remaine.
This maketh them to be ſo ſtiffe necked againſt the
ſetting forth of Gods worde, and againſt the right adminiſtration
of the ſacramentes. This maketh them to ſtudie
ſo diligently to keepe vp their altar, and to maintaine
their good friday maſſe, with the which they can beguile
the people well inough as they handle it.With their good friday maſſe, prieſts ſerue both the Pope and Gods people. Yea, to ſay the
trueth, they can doe more with this then they could do with
maſſe of Requiem ſcala coeli, Recordare, or anie other of
that ſorte. Wherefore I beſeeche them for the paſſion of
Ieſus Chriſt, If there bee anie conſolation in Chriſt,
If there bee any comforte of loue, If there bee anie
fellowſhip of the ſpirite, If there be anie compaſſion
and mercie: Let them halt no longer on both partes: Let
them blow no longer hote and cold: But let them make the
tree good and his fruites good, or els make the tree euill
and his fruite euill. To ſpeake plainely vnto them, Let
them not make a mingle mangle, and hodge podge of the
Lordes ſupper anie longer. But let them miniſter it ſimply
and plainly at the Lordes table, as Chriſt hath left it, and

as the booke of Scriptures doe truely meane, and not after
their olde popiſh faſhion as they doe, making it a ſacrifice
for ſinnes both of quicke and dead, offering it at burialles,
and monethes mindes after their olde maner, whereby
they make it abhomination of deſolation.
               Dan. 9. For as the
ſacrifice of the popiſh maſſe was the verie deſolation, departure,
and forſaking of Chriſtes oblation by death vpon
the croſſe once offered for all:The abhomination of deſolation in the holie place. So is this funerall ſacrifice,
(as they vſe it) the verie abhomination of the ſame deſolation.
Therefore let them looke better vpon holy ſcriptures
written for our learning, and followe the rules and right
meaning of the ſame, and not their popiſh rules, and ceremonies
otherwiſe then is there meant, and contrarie both
to the kinges maieſties ſtatutes, and iniunctions, and alſo
contrary vnto his maieſties proclaimation, made the xxvii.
day of December in the firſt yeare of his moſte gratious
raigne.Maſſe forbidden by proclaimation. Wherein the name of maſſe is plainly forbidden, if
ye ſame proclaimation be truly conſtured, notwithſtanding
in ye booke of cōmon praier his maieſtie ſomewhat yet beareth
with the weake learning of the multitude, which commonly
calleth the Lords ſupper by the name of maſſe after
their olde woont, which thing (me thinketh) ſhould giue no
man occaſion to ſticke ſtiffely to euill cuſtome.
            In a ſtatute made the fourth day of Nouember of the
ſame firſt yeare of his maieſties raigne and in the xiiii.Maſſe for the dead condemned by act of parliament.
Chapter: the offering of the ſacrament for the dead, which
is there called maſſes ſatiſfactory to be done for them, is
plainly condemned as a vaine thing tending to the derogation
of Chriſtes death.
            Alſo by his maieſties iniunctions chap. 28. the altar of
the ſame ſacrifice for the dead,The altars taken away by the kinges maieſties iniunctions. is taken away, for ſo much
as it is a monument of the ſuperſtition of the popiſh maſſe.
So that, for anie thing I can perceaue, they that ſo fayne
would holde vp their altars againſt them that goe about to
put them downe, both by law and order, meane none other
thing but to maintain a monument of ſuperſtition and idolatrie

in ſpight both of the kinges lawes and iniunctions.
To the ende (I meane) to allure the people the more to
their monie ſacrifice,The papiſtes deſerue nothing but ſcoffes. and to make them beleeue the better
in the God that they doe make vppon their altar or altarſtone. Without the which they (I wote) can make no God.
Ah where was this their God before the altar and altarſtone
was made? This may well be that God vnto whome
they thinke to doe good ſeruice in breaking of wedlock and
rayling againſt marriage, but ſure I am, that this is not
that God that made both heauen and earth and all thinges
in them, becauſe the altar and the altar-ſtone be ſome
thinges. Albeit, leaſt perhappes they ſhould thinke that
I would onely anſwere them with ſcoffes (though theyr
ſhameleſſe obſtinacie deſerueth none other) I will rehearſe
a few wordes out of Gods booke to ſtoppe their mouthes
withall. And when they haue anſwered and truely confuted
them, I will forſake Gods booke and the chriſtian
faith, as truely as I haue forſaken them, and all their
iugling caſtes. In the 7. Chapter to the Hebrues, it is
written. The Lord ſware and will not repent. Thou art
a prieſt for euer after the order of Melchiſedech. And
for that cauſe was Ieſus a ſtabliſher of a better teſtament.
Theſe words doe proue that Ieſus Chriſt our euerlaſting
Prieſt and mediatour hath ſtabliſhed a better teſtament
then the teſtament of the olde law. The prieſtes in
the olde law offered vp ſacrifice firſt for their owne ſinnes,
and then for the ſinnes of the people. But whereon did they
offer their ſacrifice verily?Leuit. 9. Vpon an altar.
            Ieſus Chriſt, vnto whome God the father ſware,The newe teſtament. 
               Thou
art a prieſt for euer,
               Heb. 7. 10. 
               &amp;c. Offered vp himſelfe once,Heb. 9. by hys
own bloud,1. Pet. 3. ſuffering death for our ſinnes,Heb. 10. and with that his
owne oblation hee hath made perfect for euer them that are
ſanctified.
            This is the better teſtament that Ieſus Chriſt hath ſtabliſhed
for vs,Heb. 9. not by often offering of himſelf by the hands
of ſinners, for then muſt hee haue often ſuffered ſince the

world began. But as it is appoynted vnto all men, that
they ſhould once die, and then commeth the iudgement,
euen ſo was Chriſt once offered. For as touching that he
died,
               Rom 6. 
               he died once (ſaith Paul) to take away the ſinnes
of manie.
               
               Heb. 9.
            
            By theſe Scriptures wee may conclude that Ieſus
Chriſt offering himſelfe by death vppon the croſſe once for
our redemption,Chriſt made a perfect oblation for ſinnes once, and that vppon the croſſe, and not vpon an altar. made a full,1. Pet. 2. perfite and ſufficient ſacrifice,
oblation, and ſatiſfaction for the ſinnes of all them that beleue
in him. And that this oblation was done vppon the
croſſe, and not vpon anie altar, witneſſe, Math. 27. Marke
15, Luke 23. Iohn 19. and Peter in the ſecond of his firſt
Epiſtle, ſaying. Chriſt ſuffered for vs, leauing vs an example
that we ſhould follow his ſteppes, which did no
ſinne, neither was there guile foūd in his mouth, which
when he was reuiled, reuiled not againe, when he ſuffered,
he threatned not, but committeth the vengeance
to him that iudgeth righteouſly.
               Chriſt bare our ſinnes on his owne body. 
               Which his owne ſelfe
bare our ſinnes in his body on the tree, that wee being
deliuered from ſinne ſhould liue vnto righteouſneſſe.
Howbeit, he onely (ſaith Eſay) chap. 53. Hath taken on
him our infirmities, and borne our paines, hee was
wounded for our offences,
               Chriſt with his death hath wholly healed vs. 
               and ſmitten for our wickedneſſe,
for the chaſtiſement of our peace was layd
vpon him, &amp; with his ſtripes wee are healed. What is
it to be healed with his ſtripes, but that by his death and
reſurrection he hath obtained for vs righteouſneſſe, euen
forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes,Act. 13. euen
forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes,Act 10. 43. according to the ſayinges of
the Apoſtle Peter,
               Our couenant with God is to beleue remiſsion of our ſins thorow the death of his ſonne I
                     •
                  ſus Chriſt. 
               that by him all that beleeue are iuſtified
from all thinges, And vnto him giue all the prophetes
witneſſe, that thorow his name, whoſoeuer beleeueth
in him shall receaue remiſsion of ſinnes.
This is the couenant that is betweene God &amp; vs, now, euen
that we beleeue in his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, to haue remiſſion
of ſinnes in his name thorowe hys death and reſurrection.
            
               
               This article hath the holy ghoſt ſo ſurely graued in our
heartes and written in our minds that wee cannot but ſay.
We beleue the remiſſion of ſinnes. Which alſo is ſurely
grounded vppon Gods holy word, that ſayth: This is the
teſtament that I will make vnto them,Heb. 10. 16. 17. 18. after thoſe daies
(ſaith the Lord) I will put my lawes in their hearts, and
in their mindes will I write them, and their ſinnes and
iniquities will I remember no more. And where remiſſion
of theſe things is, there is no more offering for ſin.
            So long as the ſacrifice and offering for ſinnes,How long the altars ought to haue continued. tooke
not away ſinnes, neither brought perfect remiſſion of ſins,
there remained in the Church of God altars, and continuall
ſacrifice or oblation for ſinnes.
            But when Chriſt had once offered himſelfe vppon the
croſſe by death, and by that his one oblation once offered,
had obtained remiſſiō of ſinnes, and finiſhed all things that
was due for man to pay: ſaying, It is finiſhed,
               Iohn 19. 30. giuing vp
the Ghoſt, thorough the which eternall ſpirite hee gaue
himſelfe to God without ſpot,Heb. 9 
               in a ſweet ſauour.
               Epheſ. 5. Then
was finiſhed (according to his owne ſaying) a perfect ſacrifice
for ſinne,The finall end of all ſacrifice for ſinnes. and all things due for the ſame. And alſo all
ſacrifice and oblations for ſinnes totally ended, as it is aforeſaid.
Where remiſſion of ſinnes and iniquities is, there
is no more offering for ſinne: if no offering for ſinnes, then
no altar to offer vpon. Therefore either let them prooue
Gods word to be falſe, that ſaith, Where remiſsion of,
&amp;c. the Holy ghoſt a liar, that promiſed to write the ſame
in our hearts, &amp;c. and take away this article of our faith,
I beleeue the remiſsion of ſinnes: or elſe away with their
altars and oblations vpon the ſame: I meane their mony
ſacrifice, the maſſe.
            Which altar and ſacrifice be nothing elſe but witneſſes
of their infidelitie,What the altars and ſacrifice for ſinne now doe teſtifie. idolatrie, and Iewiſh hearts. Of their
infidelitie, in that they do not beleeue remiſſion of ſinnes,
through the onely oblation of Chriſt once offered vpon the
croſſe. Of their idolatrie, in that they ſet vp another ſacrifice

and propitiation for ſinnes then God hath appoynted,
Wherein ſurely they ſhewe themſelues to bee more than
Iewiſh. For in their ſacrificing and maſſing they denie
Chriſtes death and reproue God of periurie. The propheſie
of Chriſtes death is this:Eſay. 53. 
               With his ſtripes we are healed.
By his paines and merites our paines are taken away
(as touching damnation) and our ſinnes couered. Or
by his death wee are healed from eternall death. By hys
oblation our ſinnes are healed, for hee hath purchaſed vs
perfect remiſſion of the ſame. But this hath he not done, if
there be anie ſinnes taken away by the maſſe, The which
ſinnes at the leaſt he left vnhealed. And therefore hee hath
not (if this be true) as yet ſuffered. For heauen and earth
ſhall faile, before theſe wordes be falſe. With his ſtripes
we are healed. Or by his death our ſinnes are forgiuen.
Ergo he hath ſuffered, and we wholly healed. Or els if we
be not wholly healed, he hath not yet ſuffered.
            Againe, almightie God promiſed with an othe vnto hys
ſonne Ieſus Chriſt,Heb. 7. 17. ſaying: Thou art a prieſt for euer.
               Pſal. 10. 4.
That is to ſay, Ieſus Chriſt hath offered himſelfe vppon
the croſſe by death vnto God the father once. And by that
one oblation once offered, hee hath made perfect for euer
them that are ſanctified, as it is before by the ſcriptures
euidently proued. For this one oblation once offered perfect
for euer. Ieſus Chriſt is called and is indeede a Prieſt
for euer. Whoſe ſweet oblation remaineth in the boſome
of God to our great comfort for euer. But he himſelf now
offereth no more, for he denieth no more, but liueth for
euer on the right hand of God the father, making interceſsion
for vs.
               Heb. 7. 8. Seeing then his oblation is perfect for
euer, ſerueth for euer, and hee himſelfe making interceſſion
for vs, liueth for euer: He is therefore (according to the othe
of God) Prieſt for euer. But this hee were not, if it could
bee proued that his oblation were vnperfect, as it muſt
needes be, if monie ſacrifice, the maſſe obtaineth remiſſion
of ſinnes or anie part thereof.
            
               
By theſe fewe Scriptures and ſayings grounded vpon
the ſame, it madifeſtly appeareth howe blaſphemous the
money ſacrifice, the maſſe is. Namely, it robbeth vs of
our moſt comfortable articles of our faith, which is, I beleeue
the remiſſion of ſinnes: it taketh away the veritie of
Gods Scriptures, which doe proue Chriſts oblation vpon
the Croſſe to bee perfect, whole, and ſufficient, it maketh
Chriſt a lyer when he ſayd, It is finiſhed. It adnihillateth
his merites,To maintaine the maſſe and altars is great blaſphemie and abhominable hereſie. and taketh away his paſſion from vs, and it
condemneth God of periurie. If there can bee any great
blaſphemous, and more abominable hereſies then theſe, let
all the world iudge. Of all the which, the popiſh altar is a
monument, and (as it were) an hand to leade the people
vnto, from Chriſt and his merites: wherefore all good men
hauing but one ſparke of grace with knowledge, will not
onely be content with the taking downe of them, but alſo
will (I trowe) helpe the beſt they can, euery one according
to his vocation, to the ſame.
            Moreouer, if the money ſacrifice, the maſſe, had bene ſo
neceſſarie, and vnto God ſo acceptable, as the people haue
beleeued it to be, woulde Chriſt haue giuen no commandement
thereof, no example of it, no word concerning it, what
not one word?
            
               Of preaching he gaue a ſpecial commandement ſaying:
Feede,Iohn 21. 15. Feede,Marke 16. 15. feede my lambes.Mat. 28. 19. 
               And againe, Goe ye in
to all the world and preach the Goſpel to al creatures,
            Yet this office of preaching is counted amongſt many
ſcant neceſſarie, and the meſſengers thereof ſo well looked
to, that they may ſtudie their breake faſt, pray (yea beg) for
their dinner, and weepe out their ſupper, as many other
poore ſoules doe: which thing God will ſhortly plague, if
ſpeedie remedie bee not prouided, or elſe his worde is not
true, which ſaith,Pſal. 12. 
               For the miſerable calamitie of the
poore oppreſſed, and for the ſighing and weeping of
the poore that doe lacke, I will vp, ſaith the Lord.
            
            Many are ſore offended thorough the outragiouſneſſe of

vice, ſlime, and iniquitie increaſing on euery ſide, a fewe
(I meane) doe ſtudie for amendement, and ſome wonder
what ſhould be the cauſe thereof. At whome I doe not a
litle maruaile. For if the plough man fallowing his
ground turneth it vp, and letteth it lye: and neither ſtirreth,
haroweth, nor ſoweth it: what marueile is it though it
bring him no corne, but weedes? England is but yet fallowed
with the plough of Gods word, yet ſcant fallowed,
what marueile is it then, that weedes growe faſter then
the corne? It muſt needes be ſo, vnleſſe Gods worde be
better ſowne. For manie that ſhoulde will not: A fewe
would and cannot: and ſome that can, may not, becauſe they
that ſhould will not. To remedie it, albeit I know: I cannot,
but this I know and am ſure of. Where the worde of
God is not preached,
               Prouerb. 29. 
               the people periſh.
            
            Of maſſe, we haue not ſo much as one tote or title of
God, Chriſt, or his Apoſtles giuen vs. Notwithſtanding
how haue the people cared for Maſſe, Maſſe, Maſſe, onely
with Maſſe they haue bene ſatiſfied. Why doe they not cry
now as much for preaching of the worde of God: without
the which, they periſh? Nay, why doe they crie ſo much againſt
it? Oh what murmuringes and complaininges
haue they made ſince their maſſe decayed? what lyes haue
theſe idle braines inuented, what ſlanders haue they imagined,
and what falſe rumours haue they ſprinckled abroad in
the worlde, againſt them that haue ſincerely preached the
Goſpell? How conſpire they againſt good Chriſtian miniſters
whiche according to their vocation attend their
flockes. What tumultes, vprores, and rebellions haue they
rayſed againſt their ſuperiours, to the great hinderance of
Gods holy worde? May not a man manifeſtly beholde in
them the monſtrous beaſt that fighteth againſt the lambe
and word of God?Reuel. 17. 14.
            
            No doubt, as the deuill brought vp his Church at the
beginning and increaſed it. So would he now (if he could)
vphold, maintaine, and defend the ſame. That is, not by

preaching, but by maſſing: not by feeding, but by loytering:
not by the regall authority that proceedeth from
God, but by tyranny, by authority vſurped, euen by a monſtrous
beaſt. I call it a monſtrous beaſt, that is, either
without an head, or elſe hath many heads.A monſtrous Subiects vſurping
the ſword of iuſtice, and executing vengeance vpon
theyr ſuperiours, be a body without an head, or elſe with
many heads, and therefore a monſtrous beaſt. This monſtrous
beaſt hath lift vp, borne, and mainteined the whore
of Babylon, which is the church of antichriſt.Reuel. 17.
            
            This monſtrous beaſt hath put vp her hornes heere in
England againſt the word of God, and faine would rule
the ſame againe, if the deuill could bring it to paſſe: whoſe
labour is in vaine, for we know the trueth of Gods word
proceedeth euer from God, and therefore hath God ſet it
forth amongſt vs, by his owne vicegerent, a mayden king
our liege lord and ſupreme head in his dominions next vnder
Chriſt, and that by act of parlement, with the conſent
of the nobility of the realme, and the lordes ſpirituall and
temporall, and the commons of the ſame.
            Let Sathan therefore leaue off with all his wicked inſtrumēts,
which go about to perſwade the ſilly people that
Gods booke and this new learning (as they call it) is hereſie:
whereby they ſlander theyr godly magiſtrates, and
ſpeake euill of them that be in authority.The ſeuenth note of an. Which theyr cuſtomable
ſo doing auaileth them nothing, for when they
haue prooued it hereſie (which thing they ſhall as eaſily
bring to paſſe, as to prooue light darkeneſſe, and darkeneſſe
light) then muſt they alſo compell all them that haue ſet it
forth, and all them that willingly receiued the ſame, to do open
penance for theyr manifeſt hereſie, as they ſay.
            Thus to ſpeake euill of them that be in authority, is one
of their proper markes whereby they be knowen to be of
Antichriſts brood, which hath by conſpiracy cauſed rebellion
euer againſt ſuch gouernors as haue done any thing againſt
theyr tyranny, and excommunicated, curſed, and depoſed

emperours, and kings that haue diſpleaſed theyr hypocriſie,
whoſe authority,The kings authority is next vnto Gods, &amp; l
                     •
                  ft only to his correction. as it is next vnto God,Pſal 109. ſo hath
God left the correction thereof vnto himſelfe, and neither
vnto prieſt nor people. God commandeth, ſaying: Touch
not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harme. If
it be not lawfull to touch Gods anoynted kings, Gods officers,
Gods lieutenants, Gods vicegerents that be appoynted
by God to rule in his ſted, let them take heed that do vſurpe
theyr ſword, for vndoubtedly Gods vengeance will
fall vpon them.Numb. 16. Example hereof we haue in Chorah, Dathan
and Abiram, which roſe vp againſt Moſes with other
men of the children of Iſrael, euen two hundreth and fiftie
that were captaines of the multitude, great &amp; famous men
in the congregation:Pſal. 54. but Gods vengeance fell vpon them,
for the earth opened and ſwallowed them downe aliue. Yet
theſe rebels were not of the baſe and lower ſort of the people,
but captaines and famous men. Conſider then, if God
cannot abide this rebellion and vſurping of the ſword of iuſtice
in a captaine, ſurely he will not ſuffer it in a ſouldiour.
If not in a famous or noble man, verely he will not leaue it
vnplagued in one of the lower ſubiects: no he will not let
it eſcape vnpuniſhed in whom &amp; whenſoeuer it be, becauſe
it is high treaſon againſt himſelfe.
            
               Though they worke craftily and ſecretly,
               Treaſon will out, 
               yet will theyr
falſe traitourous hearts bewray themſelues before they be
ware,
               Eccleſ. 10. 
               if Gods word (as needes it muſt) be true.
               This text is after the trāſlation of the Hebrues by Iohn Camp
                     ••
                  ſe. Be not
thou ſo bold as once to thinke or imagine euill againſt
the king, or that thou wilt reprehend the prince although
thou be alone in thy priuie chamber, for it will
come out, if not otherwiſe, ſurely the birds that flye in
the ayre will not ſuffer it to be hid.
            Heereby it appeareth that the word of God reproueth,
yea condemneth all maner of perſons, of what ſtate, condition,
or degree ſoeuer they be, that in word or thought do
ariſe vp, rebell, or reſiſt the kings authority, ſpecially in ſetting
foorth Gods worde,Rom. 13. 1. 2. 
               For there is no power but of

God,
               Gods word condemneth all them that rebell in word or thought againſt the king. 
               the powers that be are ordeined of God: whoſoeuer
therefore reſiſteth power reſiſteth the ordinance
of God: but they that reſiſt ſhall get vnto themſelues
damnation. Theſe are Gods words and not mine.
            Againe, as almighty God would that we ſhould neither
hurt nor harme his true prophets &amp; preachers of his word:
ſo Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, giueth vs a ſpeciall commandement
to beware of antichriſts prelats, calling them
falſe prophets,Math. 7. 15. ſaying, Beware of falſe prophets which
come to you in ſheeps clothing, but inwardly they are
rauening wolues. Wolues are wrapped in ſheepes clothing,
when tyrants rule in the place of ſhepheards, vnder
the titles of holy fathers, worſhipfull doctours, honourable
prelats,Mat. 15. 14. &amp;c.Mat. 16. 4. Theſe Chriſt painteth vnto vs,Mat. 12. 34. by the names
of Blinde guides,
               Mat. 23. 27. 
               Froward generation,
               The 8. note of Antichriſt. 
               Adulterous generatiō,
Phariſes Sadduces, Hypocrites, Generation of
vipers, Serpents, Adders brood, Painted ſepulchres,
Painted wall, &amp;c. who (ſaith he) do binde together heauie
burdens, and grieuous to be borne, and lay them on
mens ſhoulders, but they themſelues will not heaue at
them with one of their fingers.
               The 9. note of Antichriſt. All their workes do they
for the intent that they may be ſeene of men.
            Alſo they goe in long religious apparell, they muſt be
had in reuerence, and ſaluted with names and titles of dignity,
they ſhut vp the kingdome of heauen before men,The 10. note of Antichriſt. both
by their example and doctrine, condemning the iuſtifying
faith for hereſie.
            They vſe long prayers with lippe labor for lucres ſake,The 11. note.
they be very curious in ceremonies and trifles,The 12. note. but in great
matters, as iudgement, mercy and fayth, they haue little
regard,The 13. note. they ſee quickly a moat in another mans eye,The 14. note. but
will not looke on the beame in their owne, they are great
intanglers of mens conſciences with meates, drinkes, holy
dayes,Coloſſ. 2. and mens traditions: finally, they haue (as before
hath beene ſaid) theyr conſciences marked with the hoat yron
of burning malice, enuy, and hatred againſt all them

that loue Gods word,And the 15. note of Antichriſt. forbidding to marry, and commanding
to abſtaine from meats which God hath created to be
receiued with giuing thanks of them that beleeue &amp; know
the trueth. Theſe and ſuch like be theyr fruites: theſe be
theyr workes, ye ſhall know them (ſayth Chriſt) by theyr
works.
            That thoſe ſhould enter into the Church after that the
Goſpell was preached by the apoſtles,A true prophecie prouing Antichriſt to be come. 
               Paul playnly ſheweth,Act. 20. 29.
ſaying, I am ſure of this, that after my departing
ſhal grieuous wolues enter in among you, not ſparing
the flocke. This is the Church that cannot erre.
            Furthermore that you may the better perceiue &amp; know
the Church that cannot erre, from the Church that cannot
but erre: you ſhall vnderſtand there be but two wayes,

                  The way
of the

                        Spirits of truth.
                        Faithfull.
                        Godly.
                        Children of
God.
                        Members of
Chriſt.
                        Holy Catholike
Church.
                     
                  
                  The way
of the

                        Spirits of error.
                        Vnfaithfull.
                        Vngodly.
                        Children of the

                        Members of the
deuill.
                        Wicked Church
of Antichriſt.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               Call them by what names you will, Chriſt calleth the
one The broad way, and the other The narrow vvay,
ſaying,
               Mat. 7. 13, 14. Enter in at the ſtrait gate: for wide is the gate,
and broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and
many there be which goe in thereat. But ſtrait is the
gate, and narrovv is the vvay vvhich leadeth into life,
and fevv there be that finde it. Note diligently theſe
wordes of the trueth. He ſheweth heere two gates, two
wayes, and the end of either of them.
            
            
               The

                     Strait gate.
                     Narrow way and
life.
                  
               
               The

                     Wide gate.
                     Broad way and deſtruction.
                  
               
            
            The wide gate openeth into the broad way, and leadeth

into deſtruction, that is, death, deſperation and hell.
            The ſtrait gate openeth into the narrow way which
leadeth into life, ioy, and eternall felicity. Many do enter in
at the wide gate, &amp; walke the vroad way, whoſe end is damnation
remedileſſe: for it is written of Antichriſt,Habac. 2. 5. 
               He openeth
his deſire wide open as the hel, and is as vnſatiable
as death: all heathen gathereth he vnto him, and heapeth
vnto him all people. But few doe enter the ſtrait
gate, becauſe few do finde it: for who ſo findeth the gate, he
is in the way. In this gate whoſoeuer ſtandeth in a wauering,
looking backeward, is neither in the way nor in the
gate. No man that putteth his hands to the plough, &amp;
looketh backe,
               Luke 9. 
               is apt to the kingdome of God. To ſtagger
therefore in this matter, and to looke backe, is to be
therewith both out of the gate and the way. He that is in
the gate is in the way, and ſure of life: for the gate, way,
and life be ſo vnite in one, that it cannot be, but he that is
in them, is in poſſeſſion of the other, and he that is out of
them, looſeth the other. The gate is nothing elſe, but an
opening or dore into the way of life. Chriſt is the dore,
Chriſt is the way,Note. and Chriſt is the life,Iohn 10. which ſayth, I am
the dore, by me if any man enter in, he ſhalbe ſare. And
againe,
               Iohn 14 6, 
               I am the vvay,
               1. Iohn 5. 
               the trueth, and the life, no man
commeth to the father but by me. Alſo S. Iohn ſaith,
God hath giuen vnto vs eternall life, and this life is in
his ſonne: he that hath the ſonne hath life, and he that
hath not the ſonne of God, hath not life, Thus its Chriſt
the gate, way, and life.
            
               But who be they that do enter this gate? Forſooth the
prophet ſheweth, ſaying,
               Pſal. 118. This is the gate of the Lord,
the righteous ſhall enter into it. The righteous O
Lorde, who be righteous? Chriſt onely is righteous,
wee all are ſinners.
               1. Iohn 1. 
               For If wee ſay wee haue no ſinne
we deceiue our ſelues, and there is no trueth in vs,
If wee acknowledge our ſinnes hee is faythfull and
iuſt to forgiue vs our ſinnes, and to clenſe vs from all

vnrighteouſneſſe.1. Iohn. 2. Theſe thinges I doe write (ſayth
Iohn) vnto you, that you ſinne not: And if anie man
ſinne, we haue an aduocate with the father, Ieſus Chriſt
the righteous, and he it is that obtaineth grace for our
ſinnes Loe here is our righteouſneſſe, by this aduocate, and
for this aduocates ſake ſo manie as pertaine vnto fayth, be
reckoned and called righteous. Of the which righteouſnes
it is written.
               Habbak. The righteous ſhall liue by his owne
faith:2. Rom. and if he withdraw himſelfe,1. Heb. 10. my ſoule ſhall haue
no pleaſure in him. It is not we (ſaith Paul) that withdrawe
our ſelues vnto damnation, but we pertain vnto
faith, to the winning of the ſoule. For by fayth the ſoule
winneth the righteouſnes that is in Chriſt Ieſu our Lord,
if he withdraw not himſelfe, that is, if he neither for loue of
the worlde nor feare of tormentes forſake not the trueth receiued,
nor denie it before men. Which trueth ſaith He that
denieth me before men,Luke 12. ſhal be denied before the Angels
of God.Mat. 10. 
               Alſo, He that endureth to the end, ſhal be
ſaued. Therefore, ſo manie as pertaine vnto faith, muſt
holde faith, ſlicke vnto Chriſt, ſtand faſt, and walke in the
trueth, and then they ſhalbe happie, and their ſinnes ſhall
not be imputed vnto them, as witneſſeth the prophet, ſaying:
Bleſſed is hee vvhoſe vnrighteouſneſſe is forgiuen,Pſal. 32.
and vvhoſe ſinne is couered. Bleſſed is the man vnto
vvhome the Lord imputeth no ſinne, and in vvhoſe
ſpirite there is no guile. But who is the cauſe that ſume
is not imputed to the faithfull? Not our righteouſneſſe, but
the righteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt. Which of God is made
vnto vs wiſedome,1. Cor. 1. and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctifiyng,
and redemption. Who hath indeede for vs fulfilled all
righteouſneſſe,
               Mat. 3. 
               wherewith wee be indewed through faith,
according to the word of God that ſaith,
               Rom 3. The righteouſneſſe
of God commeth by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt vnto
all, and vpon all them that beleue on him: And therefore
we hold that a man is iuſtified by faith. To be iuſtified
by faith is to be made by faith ſure of Chriſtes righteouſneſſe

our iuſtification. For he yt beleeueth in him that iuſtifieth
the vngodly,
               Rom. 4. 
               is his faith counted for righteouſnes. For
this cauſe is Ieſus Chriſt called, Emauel,
               Mat. 1. 
               which by interpretation
is as much to ſay, as God vvith vs, or whole
ours. This is the gate, this is the way, this is life.
               Iohn 10. 
               The
holy Ghoſt openeth the gate,
               Epheſ. 2. 
               for he is the porter, and ſayth
is the gifte of God. Faith findeth the gate, fayth entreth,
and faith ſetteth hold on life.
               Gen. 6. 
               By faith Noah found and entred
this gate, which ſaued him from drowning. Into this
gate entred Abraham when hee forſooke his countrie, nanation
and fathers houſe,
               cen. 12. 
               and obeyed Gods worde. This
gate found Lot whereby hee eſcaped burning.
               Gen. 18. Moyſes,
Aaron, Ioſue and diuers of the faithful Iewes found this
gate, &amp; therby were ſure of their ſaluation, Philip had found
this gate when he ſaid vnto Nathaniel.Iohn 1. We haue found
him of vvhome Moyſes in the lavv and the prophetes
did vvrite, Ieſus of Nazareth. Whereby it appeareth yt
the fathers in the olde law before the incarnatiō of Chriſt,
found Chriſt this gate, way, and life. For Nathaniel ſound
this gate by faith before he ſawe Chriſt with his corporall
eyes, els had not hee bene a verie Iſraelite without guile,
Of whome Chriſt ſaid,
               Iohn 1. Behold a right Iſraelite in vvhom
is no guile. Nathaniel knowledged this gate when he ſaid
vnto Chriſt, Maiſter, thou art the ſonne of God, Thou
art the king of Iſrael. Peter alſo and the other of the Apoſtles
confeſſed the ſame, when they ſaid, Thou art Chriſt
the ſonne of the liuing God.Math. 16. 
               All, euen ſo manie as our
ſauiour prayed for, found and ſhall finde this gate, which
be but a verie fewe in compariſon of them that finde it not.
They be (as wee might ſay) but an handfull to the world
By the which name they be alſo called that enter the wide
gate and walke the broad way. Chriſt the ſonne of God,
ſaying and praying vnto the father.
            
            
               Father,
               Iohn 17. 
               I pray not for the vvorld, but for them vvhich
thou haſt giuen me, for they are thine, and all mine
are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorif
                     •
                  ed in

them. And Neuertheleſſe I pray not for them alone,
but for them alſo vvhich shall beleeue on me thorovv
their preaching, that they all may be one, as thou father
art in me, and I in thee, and that they alſo may be
one in vs, that the vvorld may beleeue that thou haſt
ſent me. Ieſus Chriſt knewe right well that the greater
number would not enter this gate by faith, and therefore
he ſaid, I pray not for the world. He would haue all ſaued
and come to the knowledge of his trueth, but they will not
beleeue the trueth, but hate and perſecute the trueth. And
therefore he knowing the great danger that his ſmal ſlock
were in, and ſhould be in amongeſt the wicked, and their
ſmall ſtrength alſo in ſauing themſelues from their tyrannie,
prayed for them that they might be one in faith and
loue, hauing the ſpirit of trueth dwelling in them. Whereby
they euer haue in poſſeſſion that pretious pearle and
hidden treaſure that the worlde can neyther taſte nor finde,
becauſe hee that will haue and taſte it, muſt in finding it
therewith renounce and giue for it all that hee hath, or elſe
hee looſeth it.Math. 13, Whiche thing onely the electe that haue
the Spirite of trueth,Luke 14. whome the worlde cannot haue,
doe, and none elſe. And thereby they haue, yea and feele
in theyr great afflictions that peace of conſcience, that
Chriſt gaue vnto them, ſaying, Peace I leaue vvith
you, my peace I giue vnto you, not as the world giueth,
giue I vnto you.
               Iohn 14. 
               Let not your hearts be grieued, neither
feare. From the which neither loſſe of friends and
goods, neither loſſe of good name and fame, nor ſhame of
the world, neither threatnings nor priſonment, nor ſcourginges
and tormentes, nor yet death it ſelfe could ſeparate
them that had once entred, felt, and taſted how ſweete the
Lord is. This made Peter, Andrew, Iohn, Iames, and
the other apoſtles to forſake all things, eſteeming it to be
more woorth then goodes, friendes, or life in this world.
Paul being in this gate, and taſting the ſweetneſſe thereof
with a vehement ſpirit ſayth, Who shal ſeparate vs frō
                  
the loue of God?
               Rom. 8. 
               Shal tribulation? or anguish? or perſecution?
either hunger? either nakednes? either peril? either
ſword? Who ſaith, I am ſure that neither death nor
life, neither angels, nor rule, nor povver, neither thinges
preſent, nor things to come, neither high, nor lovv, nor
any other creature shalbe able to ſeparate vs from the
loue of God, which is in Chriſt Ieſu our Lord? For this
the holy Catholike Church ſuffereth and euer ſhall ſuffer all
kindes of torments vntill Chriſt commeth againe to deliuer
her, as euer hitherto they haue ſuffered, whereof ſome
were mocked, ſome ſcourged, ſome priſoned, ſome hamſhed,
ſome drowned, ſome ſawen, ſome hewen in pieces, ſome
burned, ſome racked, and ſome ſtened to death. Which holy
Catholike Church may well ſay, according to the ſcriptures,
Thou (O God) makeſt vs to be rebuked of our
neighbours,
               Pſal. 44. 
               to be laughed to ſcorne, and had in deriſion
of them that be round about vs. And For thy ſake
are vve killed all day long,
               Rom. 8. 
               and are counted as sheepe
appointed to be ſlaine. Theſe be the few that do finde the
narrow gate: theſe be the righteous that doe finde and enter
the ſame: theſe be they that Chriſt ſo louingly prayed
for, whoſe prayer (without faile) becauſe of his reuerence
was heard: theſe be they that be one in faith and loue.Heb. 5. euen
of one heart and one minde, in one houſe, the holy catholike
church, vnite and knit together with one ſpirit, the ſpirit of
trueth that cannot erre.
            Moreouer, euery one that is of this holy Catholike
church, may ſay with the Prophet,Pſal. 119. 
               Thy vvord (O Lord)
is a lanthorne vnto my feet, and a light vnto my paths.
For they ſtabliſh theyr faith by the word of God, and ſtudy
to forme theyr life, &amp; to faſhion theyr maners by the ſame.
who he knowen by three notable ſignes,Three ſure ſignes of the holy catholike church. by faith, by loue,
and by the ſpirit of God. He that lacketh any one of theſe,
is not in the ſtrait gate, but wide gate: he walketh not in
the narrow way, but broad way: he is not of the church of
Ieſus Chriſt, but of the church of Antichriſt.
            
               
               Faith is a ſure confidence of things vvhich are hoped
for,
               Faith. 
               and a certaintie of thinges vvhich are not ſeene.
               Heb. 11.
This faith bringeth vs the knowledge of God, and maketh
vs to vnderſtand our owne ſinfull nature and weakeneſſe: for Paule ſath,Heb. 11. 
               Through faith we vnderſtand that
the world was ordained by the word of God, and that
thinges which are ſeene are made of thinges which are
not ſeene, &amp;c. Of our owne infirmitie by ſinne, we haue
example in him that brought his ſonne vnto Ieſus to be
healed,Mark
                     •
                   9. which with teares ſayd, Lord I beleue, helpe thou
my vnbeliefe. This man vndoubtedly ſaw by faith great
imperfections in himſelfe, euen his ſinne, as it were, ouerwhelming
his faith, and therefore he wept, and ſayd, Lord
helpe thou my vnbeliefe.
               Luke 17. The firſt thing that faith worketh in vs. Likewiſe the Apoſtles conſidering
theyr great burden of ſinne and fraileneſſe, ſaid vnto
the Lord, Increaſe our faith. This is the firſt thing that
faith worketh in vs, it bringeth vs the knowledge of our
ſinne, and vileneſſe of the ſame, and maketh vs to crie to
God for helpe and ſeeke remedie for our ſinne, which is
Ieſus Chriſt, that gaue himſelfe to death vpon the croſſe
for our ſinne as is aforeſaid. Thus wrought faith in the
penitent publican that thought himſelfe vnworthy to lift, vp
his eyes vnto heauen, but ſmote himſelfe vpon the breſt,
ſaying,Luke 18. 
               God be mercifull to me a ſinner. Thus fayth
wrought in the Centurien or petie captaine, which iudged
himſelfe vnworthy of Chriſtes preſence,Luke 7. ſaying. Lord I am
not worthie that thou ſhouldeſt enter vnder my roufe:
wherefore I thought not my ſelfe vvorthy to come
vnto thee, but ſay thou the word and my ſeruant ſhal
be whole, &amp;c. Such a lowe eſtimation did faith worke in
Peter when he ſaid,Luke 5. 
               Lord goe from me for I am a ſinfull
man. And leaſt anie man ſhould contend herein, yt this faith
(which thus bringeth vs knowledge of God &amp; of our owne
ſinful nature &amp; weakneſſe) ſhould be a fayned faith, a dead
faith, or a deuils faith: heare ye praise therof by him yt cannot
flatter nor lie ye truth, who ſaith, of the ſame, I ſay vnto you

haue not found ſo great a faith,
               Luke 7. 
               no not in Iſrael. Note,
Chriſt calleth this a great faith. Verily it ſo great that it
bringeth vs our iuſtification and peace with God,The ſecond thing that faith worketh in vs. which is
the ſecond thing that faith worketh in vs. That faith bringeth
vs the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt our iuſtification, is already
plainely prooued by the ſcriptures and writings of
Paule, who goeth further and ſaith,Rom. 5. 
               Becauſe therfore that
we are iuſtified by faith, wee are at peace with God.
And to declare the very gate, dore and way, wherby we enter
into this peace and fauour of God, hee addeth ſaying,
Through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
               Rom. 5. 
               by whom alſo it chanced
vnto vs, to be brought in through faith vnto this
grace wherein we ſtand, and reioyce in the hope of the
glory of the children of God. Heere you ſee manifeſtly
faith entereth into the ſtrait gate which is Chriſt.The third thing that faith worketh in vs. This
faith is not idle, for it maketh vs to ſtand, that is to ſay, to
perſeuere and walke in the narrow way by loue, which is
the third thing that faith worketh in vs, and therfore it followeth,
Not that onely, but alſo we reioyce in tribulations,
knowing that tribulation bringeth patience, patience
bringeth experience, experience bringeth hope,
and hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the loue of
God is ſhedde abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt
which is giuen vnto vs. No thanke then vnto our faith, no
thanke vnto our loue, but all thanke and praiſe, and glory be
giuen vnto God, whoſe holy ſpirit worketh fayth, loue,
hope, patience, and altogether in vs.
            Fayth that worketh by loue is much worth before God,Loue.
which loue is the ſecond note of the holy Catholike church:Gal. 5.
fayth fetcheth this loue of the great loue of God, which firſt
ſo loued vs, that hee gaue his onely begotten ſonne Ieſus
Chriſt, to the end that all that beleeue in him ſhould not periſh,
but haue life euerlaſting. Of this loue ſpeaketh Paule,
ſaying,Epheſ. 5. 
               Walke in loue euen as Chriſt loued vs, and gaue
himſelfe for vs an offering and ſacrifice of a ſweete ſauour
to God. This loue Paule learned of his maſter our

ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, commanding and ſaying,Iohn 13. 
               A newe
commandement I do giue vnto you, that ye loue together
as I haue loued you. Ieſus Chriſt ſo loued vs, that
he gaue himſelfe for vs, for he was obedient vnto God the
father for vs vnto death, yea vnto death vpon the croſſe.
This loue ſo warmeth the heart with hope and aſſurance
of euerlaſting life (for we are ſaued by hope) that it putteth
away all ſeruile feare:Hope &amp; feare. I ſay not all feare,Rom. 8. for there remaineth
and abideth in the heart an holy reuerend feare or
dread of diſpleaſing God, or lothneſſe to looſe God and his
holy ſpirit, which if a man taſte, is rather a reuerend ioy,
and a glad loue than feare: therefore is it truely ſaid, Perfect
loue caſteth out feare,
               1. Iohn 4. that is to ſay, Ieſus Chriſt by
his holy ſpirit poſſeſſing the heart of man through fayth,
pntteth cleane away the feare of ſhame, loſſe of goodes or
friends, the feare of torments, enemies, and priſonment, yea
the feare of ſinne,The office of true faith. death, the deuill and hell. So that the office
of true faith ſetteth not onely before our eyes the vileneſſe
of ſinne, that cauſed Chriſt to die, but it alſo bringeth
vs Ieſus Chriſt the attonement maker betweene God and
vs for our ſinne, whereof commeth loue. In the which loue
is manifeſt the third note of the holy Catholike church,The ſpirit of Chriſt. for
now we feare God no more as a terrible iudge, but thorow
his holy ſpirit we loue him as a moſt gentle &amp; louing
father, whereof ſpeaketh Paule, ſaying thus: Ye haue not
receiued the ſpirit of bondage to feare any more, but
you haue receiued the ſpirit of adoption,
               Rom. 8. 
               whereby we
crie, Abba, Father. Abba is as much in Engliſh as Dad,
or Deare father: it is the Syrian ſpeech, left vntranſlated
both by the Latine men, &amp; alſo Engliſh men, to the intent
(I ſuppoſe) that it ſhould alſo be Engliſh: for this I know,
that the firſt word that an Engliſh Chriſtian childe beginneth
to ſpeake, is Abba, commonly, long before he can
ſpeake any thing elſe, which Chriſtian babe in his innocencie
is a witneſſe with Paule that God is a deare father vnto
Chriſtians through his holy ſpirit, by his ſonne Ieſus

Chriſt.Faith, loue, &amp; the ſpirit of God, be together in euery true Chriſtian. Thus you may eaſily perceiue by thoſe ſcriptures
that faith, loue, and the ſpirit of God doe go together, and
be together in euery true Chriſtian as ſure notes and ſeales
of his ſaluation. Faith entring the gate of ſaluation, ſticketh
to the word of God, and taketh it onely to be the rule
of life and doctrine. Loue cleaueth vnto Chriſt, and maketh
faith knowen, as the fruits do the tree, and putteth away
feare. The ſpirit of God quieteth the conſcience, and
bringeth with a reuerend dread, ioy and gladneſſe ineffable.
If you know this, you be a very true member of the holy
Catholike church, and in the ſtrait gate and narrow way
vnto eternall life. If you know not this, I ſay no more but
God haue mercy vppon you:Math. 7. 
               For wide is the gate and
broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many
there be which go in thereat.
            
            Heere (me thinketh) I do heare an idle braine ſay, that
theſe ſignes and notes be of mine owne inuention, which
do rather confoūd &amp; dim the church, than make it knowen.
Vnto whom I doe anſwere,2. Cor. 4. If it be dim and hid, it is hid
vnto them that periſh: but vnto the children of light it is
manifeſt enough. Alſo theſe notes be not mine, but rather
Gods books, there I do finde them.
            Of the firſt, Chriſt ſaith, Euery tree is knowen by his
fruites.
               Luke 6. Which words be made plaine by theſe ſayings of
Paule:The firſt note of Chriſtes church. 
               To beleeue with the heart,
               Rom. 10. 
               iuſtifieth, &amp; to knowledge
vvith the mouth, maketh a man ſafe. Faith then
is not dead in the heart: if it be dead, it is not faith: faith is
knowen by the mouth, as the tree is knowen by the fruits,
for of the treaſure of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh. A good
man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth
forth that vvhich is good.
               Luke 6.
            
            
               Of the ſecond,
               The ſecond note of Chriſtes church. 
               Iohn ſaith,
               1. Iohn 4. God is loue, and hee that
dvvelleth in loue, dvvelleth in God, and God in him.
He then cannot be hid in whome God dwelleth. And
               1. Iohn 2.Hee
that loueth his brother abideth in the light, and there
is no occaſion of euill in him. The light therefore muſt
               
needs be ſeene. Heere is to be noted, that as faith without
godly works is a dead faith, and therefore no faith: ſo loue
without the ſame good weeks alſo is not loue, but naturall
affection,1. Iohn 3. 
               For vvho ſo hath theſe vvorlds goods, &amp; ſeeth
his brother hath need, and shutteth vp his compaſsion
from him, hovve dvvelleth the loue of God in him?
Thus is loue manifeſtly knowen by the good worke. Our
fauiour Ieſu Chriſt appointing this to be the notable ſigne
of the church, faith vnto them,Iohn 13. 
               By this shall all men knovv
that ye are my diſciples, if ye haue loue one to another.
            
            Of the third note,The third note of Chriſtes church. Rom. 8. which is the ſpirit of God, Paule
writing to the Romanes, hath theſe wordes, If any man
haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his.
And a little after, he ſpeaking of himſelfe and other of the
church of Chriſt, ſaith: The ſame ſpirit certifieth our ſpirit
that we are the children of God. If the ſpirit of God
certifieth a mans conſcience that he is the childe of God,
then hee may be ſure that hee is of the church of Chriſt.
Heereby you perceiue that theſe notes are appoynted by
Gods booke, &amp; not of mine inuention,The ſure ſignes of the holy Catholike church be gathered out of Cods booke. to be vnfallible ſignes

ſame, which be all of one faith, vnite as one by loue, &amp; gouerned

            Finally, if theſe ſignes of the holy catholicke Church
be not yet euident and plaine inough vnto you, to knowe the

Whereof they haue of their maiſter Chriſt a ſpeciall commandement
ſo earneſtly giuen vnto them, as though hee
had required of them that alone, binding them as they loued
him, to teache, feede, and preach vnto his ſheepe. And
as he required of them this teaching and preaching of the
Goſpel moſt earneſtly,Mat. 10. 28. ſo did he moſt often put them in memory
of the ſame.Marke 6. 6. This was the principall and great commiſſion
that he gaue them,Iohn 21. after his reſurrection, ſaying.
All power is giuen vnto me in heauen and in earth.
               Math. 28. 
               Go
ye therefore and teache all nations, baptiſing them in
the name of the father, and of the ſonne, and of the holie
Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerue all thinges, whatſoeuer
I haue commanded you. Other thingee then
Chriſt hath commanded to be taught, may not bee taught
by Chriſtes commiſſion, who ſaith alſo, The holy hhoſt
ſhall teache you.
               Luke 12. What? All thinges,
               Iohn 14. 
               and bring all
thinges vnto your remembrance, whatſoeuer I haue
ſaid vnto you. Againe, that they might be ſure of theyr
vndeceaueable rule,Marke 16. he ſaith. Preache the goſpell to all
creatures, vnto thē that thus do. He ſaith further, He that
heareth you,
               Luke 10. 
               heareth me, and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth
me, and hee that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him
that ſent me. Becauſe the children of perdition walking
in the broad way, deſpiſe the narrow way of the Goſpell,
and teachers of the ſame, they doe commit high treaſon againſt
Chriſt and againſt God, for that they doe not regard,
but contemne the great commiſſion of God, the Goſpel
of his ſonne Ieſus. Although this Goſpel ſhould be
for a time troad vnder feete and ſealed vp,The Goſpel. is a witneſſe to all the world. as it was prophecied,Dan. 12.
and as we haue ſeene it,Mat. 24. yet ſhould it be a witneſſe
to all the world. Chriſt ſaith, This Goſpel of the kingdome
ſhalbe preached in all the worlde, for a witneſſe
to all nations, and then shall the end come. The goſpel
is a witneſſe of Chriſt and his Church to al nations in the

world. To the wicked it is a witneſſe, that they loue darkeneſſe
more then light becauſe their workes are euill.Iohn 3. To
the godly it is a ſure ſtay and witneſſe that they are of the
holy Catholicke Church, and members of Chriſt.
            This is a plaine token of the holy catholicke church,A plaine token of the holy catholicke Church.
that whereſoeuer this goſpel is ſet forth in ye mother toong
and countrie ſpeache, and ſincerlie taught, there bee the
true members of Chriſtes Church. Example hereof we
haue in the preaching of the ſame by the Apoſtles at Hieruſalem,
in whome the holy Ghoſt ſo wrought that they
ſpake to euerie man (many beeing there of diuers and
ſtrange languages) in their owne mother toonge, and countrie
ſpeeche.Actes 2.
            
            The true miniſters of the worde (in whome the holy
Ghoſt ſpeaketh) euer teache the people in their owne language
that they vnderſtand, and not in a ſtrange toonge
that they knowe not. We may therefore be glad and ioy to
haue ſeene and heard the ſame Goſpel here in England, ſet
forth in our mother toonge preached according to Chriſtes
promiſe and ſincerely taught.
            O it is a worlde to behold the ſubtiltie of Sathan working
in theſe wicked worldlinges. When hee feeleth by
preaching of the Goſpel, that his counterfeit religion is
eſpied, and that his lies and falſe miracles will ſerue to
blinde and deceaue the people no longer: then he beſtirreth
himſelfe, then hee ſeeketh out his truſtie friendes and ſetteth
them a worke, to ſtirre the people to murmuringes,
tumultes,When the deuill had men faſt by falſe faith, hee cared not for their euill life. The ſecond manifeſt note of Chriſtes Church. and vprores, to the end that by deuiſions, debates,
and diſcordes, he may eyther face out the Goſpel, or
els for that he looſeth ſome in their faith, hee might winne
moe by their euill life: Whereby (albeit againſt their wil)
both the deuill and his miniſters doe giue an euident teſtimonie
of the Goſpel. For Ieſus Chriſt the wiſedome of
God the father knowing that it would be ſo, ſhewed that
it ſhould be ſo, both by his wordes and example taking vpon
him, that the wicked would lay to his charge, ſaying,

               Thinke not that I am come to ſend peace into the
earth:
               Math. 10. 
               I came not to ſend peace, but a ſword. For I am
come to ſet a man at a variance againſt his father, and
the daughter againſt her mother, and the daughter in
lawe againſt her mother in lavv, and a mans foes shalbe
they that be of his owne houshold. And he prophecieth
alſo, ſaying, Suppoſe yee that I am come to ſend peace
on the earth.
               Luke 12. 
               I tell you nay, but rather deuiſion. For
from hence forth there ſhalbe fiue in one houſe deuided,
three againſt two, and two againſt three. The father
ſhalbe deuided againſt the ſonne, and the ſonne againſt
the father. The mother againſt the daughter, and
the daughter againſt the mother. The mother in lawe
againſt her daughter in law, and the daughter in lawe
againſt her mother in lavv.
               Chriſt propheciyng of the diſcord that would be thorow the preaching of the goſpel, taketh vpon him the ſalt of others. In this phraſe of ſpeache
Chriſt ſhewed not himſelfe to be the authour and cauſe of
diſcord and diuiſion, but hee rather declared in their owne
wordes their falſe ſtanders. Hee knewe right well that the
wicked woulde reſiſt the goſpell with lyes, ſtaunders and
tumultes: and when they had thorow their owne malice craftily
rayſed ſuch tragedies, then they would (diſburdening
themſelues) lay it to Chriſtes charge and to his holy word,
or miniſters of the ſame. Thus hath it bene in out time.
The wicked hating the Goſpel, haue ſtirred vprores and
vnquietneſſe amongeſt the people, and then they haue burdened
the Goſpel and preacher withall. Thus the Scribes
and Phariſees with their Diſciples, moued the people againſt
Chriſt, whereby they made vnquietneſſe, and then
they accuſed Chriſt of blaſphemie, hereſie &amp; making of diſcention,Math. 26.
traitours and blaſphemous heretickes,Luke 22. neither
true to God nor the Prince. For this cauſe, Chriſt knowing
before, vouchſafe to bewray their malice, taking vpon
himſelfe the perſon of diſcord, when in verie deedele is the
berie peacemaker, becauſe he knewe they woulde ſo iudge
him and reporte him to be, as wee can witneſſe they haue

doon. wherfore wee muſt needes beleue this his propheſie,
nowe that we haue heard it, and ſeen it fulfilled.
            Trulie,The banner of Chriſt goeth euer with his Church, as the ſhadow goeth with the body. Trulie,Mat. 10. as the ſhadowe followeth the bodie: ſo
Chriſtes croſſe followeth the holy Catſlolique church. And
as the greater the height of the ſunne is, the more is the
ſhadow ſeene: ſo, the greater the height of the goſpel ſhinneth
by preaching, the more manifeſt is the croſie of Chriſt,
who ſayth. He that loueth father or mother more then
me, is not worthie of me, and hee that loueth ſonne or
or daughter more then me, is not vvorthie of me. And
he that taketh not his croſſe and follovveth me, is not
vvorthie of me. Alſo if anie man vvill come after me,
               Luke 9.
               let him deny himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe dayly and
follovv mee. For vvhoſoeuer vvill ſaue his lyfe, ſhall
loſe it. But vvhoſoeuer doth loſe his life ſot my ſake, the
ſame shall ſaue it. For vvhoſoeuer is ashamed of me
and my vvords, of him shall the ſonne of man be ashamed
vvhen he commeth in his maieſtie, and the maieſtie
of his father. It is vnpoſſible to ſticke vnto the Goſpel
without the croſſ, without trouble or perſecution,2. Tim. 3.
               Paul being witneſſe, ſaying: All they that vvill liue godly
in Chriſt Ieſu shall ſuffer perſecution. Of the which
croſſe and perſecution Chriſt prophecied ſaying, ye shall
be hated of all men for my names ſake.
               Mat. 10. But vnto this in
another place he giueth a better cōfort,Iohn 15. ſaying, If the vvorld
hate you, you knovve it hated me before it hated you.
If ye vvere of the vvorld, the vvorlde vvould loue hys
ovvne. Hovvbeit becauſe yee are not of the vvorlde,
but I haue choſe you out of the vvorlde, therefore
the vvorlde hateth you. Remember the vvord that
I ſaide vnto you. The ſeruaunt is not greater them
his Lorde: if they haue perſecuted me they vvill
perſecute you. Seeing the trueth hath ſpoken theſe
thinges,The third manifeſt note of Chriſtes Church. they muſt needes come to paſſe. Wherefore it
now remaineth, that all louers of the Goſpel and trueth,
doe patiently ſticke vnto the trueth in all their tribulations,

and call to memorie their maiſters firſt promiſe and bleſſing,
which is written. Where he ſaith: Bleſſed are they
that ſuffer perſecution for righteouſnes ſake, for theirs
is the kingdome of heauen. To ſuffer for righteouſneſſe
and truthes ſake (me thinketh) muſt be a ſigne of the elect
of God. For they verily yt do liue immofluely in the world,
and charitably with their neighbours, and notwithſtanding
be hated, euill ſpoken of, ſtandered, and perſecuted of
the wicked, onely for ſpeaking againſt ſinne and iniquitie,
and for the Goſpels ſake, haue great cauſe to ioy in their
trouble and perſecution, as it ſolloweth.
            Bleſsed are yee vvhen men shal ſpeake euil of you,
and perſecute you, and shal ſpeake all euil againſt you,
lying, for my ſake. Reioyce yee and be glad, for plenteous
is your revvarde in heauen Loe this is the Churche
that cannot erre.
            
            Thus I haue deſcribed before your eies both the church
of Antichriſt, which cannot but erre, and alſo the Church of
Ieſus Chriſt that cannot erre, plainly, with their ſignes
and notes: Note them therefore circumſpectly. The church
of Antichriſt is not ſtabliſhed vppon the veritie of Gods
worde and ſpirite, which is the ſure foundation of the holy
catholicke Church, but vpon a ſinful man, quia omnis homo
mendax, becauſe euerieman is a lyer. Chriſtes Churche
hath one iuſtifiyng faith which worketh by loue, for the
which Antichriſtes Church hath manie faithes, as, a little
faith, a ſmale faith, an vnperfect faith, a deceiuing fayth, a
ſick faith, and a dead faith, Dominikes faith, Baſils fayth
Auſtens faith, Bennets faith, Bernardes faith, Frances
faith, and Deuils faith. All which may enter the wide gates
and be admitted into the popes Church, and pertaker of
his mony ſacrifices. Where note they be the greater number:
which thing maketh them bolde to perſecute the few
and ſmall flocke that entreth the ſtraite gate of fayth, and
walketh the narrow way of the Goſpel, which ſmall flock
neuer perſecuteth. For it is againſt the nature of a lambe

to ſucke the bloud of a Woolfe. It is the propertie of the
Woolfe to ſucke bloud, deuour and perſecute.
            The church of Ieſus Chriſt euer ſuffereth, loueth, and
prayeth for enemies and perſecutours.
            Antichriſte brood do murmure, hate, &amp; perſecute, with
a filthy conſcience.
            Vnto the church of Ieſus Chriſt onely Gods booke is
a perfect rule of beliefe, life, and doctrine, in ſtead whereof
Antichriſts generation hath many books and rules, as holy
decrees and decretals, fathers, coumels, holy doctours,
Feſtiuale, Legenda aurea, Auſtens rule, Benets rule, Baſils
rule, Bernards rule, Dominiks rule, Francis rule, and
now laſt of all Canterbury tales with a dung-cart ſul alſo
of vnwritten verites. Theſe haue beene brought in, and
taught by the ſpirits of errour, the very guides &amp; ſtayes of
Antichriſts church, &amp; therfore they could not but erre. But
the church of Ieſus Chr
                  •

is gouerned with one ſpirit of trueth that cannot lie,
therefore cannot they erre, euen with the ſpirit of

the father, and the ſome, be all
thanks, laud, praiſe
