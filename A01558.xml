            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               IN Marcelles, a Towne in France, one Lewis Gaufredy (borne in Beauuerer Les Colmars) liued many yeares in very good repute, being there beneficed in the Church of the Accoules, where such was his wordly excesse of prosperitie, that notwithstanding his Ecclesiasticall function through a setled pride now raised to the height, and a beastly and strong luxurious appetite formerly bred and now raigning and raging also in him, he became méerely sensuall? He had an aged Unkle also well knowne both in Marcelles, and other places thereabouts, of as pernitious manners as himselfe, who was no small backe to his impieties, who happening to die very rich, aswel in Lands and reuenues, as in Gold and siluer, Bookes &amp; other moueables, which this miscreant (being indéed the next heire) no sooner claimed, but was as soone possest thereof Now being thus ouermuch inriched, what else could be vnto him greater contentment then to take his ease, and as he could permit himselfe any leisure for such purposes, he would sometimes for recreation sake betake himselfe to that Library, formerly his Unkles, where amongst other bookes (not much opponent to his obscene liking) he hapned to light

                  ādouls, so called of ye 
               Marish, would be an endlesse torment to my soule, together with other his allurements, sorceries, Incantations, and abhominations, wherin this perfidious wretch spent the most flourishing part of his youthfull spring time: who forgetting the Obligation wherein he stood bound to his Creator and Sauiour (without any regard or pittie of his owne soule) plunged himselfe so déepely into the Infernall Gulph of the Coniurations and Inuocations comprehended &amp; contained in the said bookes of Toliet and Agrippa, that in pronouncing and often repetition to himselfe of what he there read, the vowed enemie to all mankind appeared &amp; approached neare vnto him, demaunding vpon what occasion he did inuoake and call vpon him, or what his desire was? the fearefull sight of whom (albeit the appearance was in a beautifull humane shape) did driue this horrible blasphemer vnto such an affrighted Extasie, that for a time he was and continued as one distracted: accursed wretch, more happie had it bin, that euen in that distraction thou hadst lost thy being, then so diabolicallie to reuiue to die againe: and dying, to draw with thee (insnared by thy subtiltie) so may sillie soules, the number whereof is best knowne to God alone, pittie it was that hell did not then swallow thée vp, or the Earth deuoure, or fire from heauen consume thée. But who can reach▪ vnto the depth of Gods al-séeing prouidence? whose

armes are stretched out, and whose arrowes are keene, when he pleaseth to be auenged on his Enemies? Thou wast not thus long suffered but to Gods greater glorie. This said distraction continuing but a while, this caitiue re-assuming his former sences, forgetting all dutie or respect vnto his Creator, and reiecting all soule sauing considerations, after no long debatement betweene the Diuell and himself, he couenanted (wofull couenant?) that for the space of fortie yeares he might enioy the full fruition of his detested ambition, in holding the place, prerogatiues, liberties, and honors, of chiefe and principall Confessor, that he might haue power and meanes to know carnally all women or maides whatsoeuer on whom his pernitious and lustfull eyes should but reflect, and that his charming tongue might flow with eloquence, and that notwithstanding these, he might be still reputed graue and religious: to these may be added those ensuing Articles of his owne confession, to which the Diuell condescending, This firebrand of perdition gaue himselfe body and soule, together with all things else to him appropriate to the said Diuell from thenceforth for euer, hidiously renouncing God his faith, Heauen, and the euer-blessed fellowship of all the holy Angels and Saints of God: who can reade this, or who can heare it, but their haire must stand on end! their hearts tremble? Ah treacherous caitiffe, whence couldst thou deriue that power &amp; title, so lightly to passe ouer and to confirme the contract and sale of thy body &amp; soule, to him, who for requitall, will pay thée with griefe vpon griefe, torment vpon torment, and that not for a moment onely, but perpetually. Beware therefore all ye whose soules are luxuriously affected, &amp; whose hearts are swolne big with pride, whose ambition pierceth the very heauens, coueting as did those aspiring Angels, to be as Gods, for by these and such like baites and snares, that wilie deceiuer intangleth, insnareth, and catcheth many millions of soules, craftie fowler, sillie fowles, now

more pretious then the richest Iemmes, but by and by as stubble for the fire, buying their too late repentance at so deare a rate as eternall desperate despaire, for so it fell out with him, who so soone as he was possest of that diuelish Librarie, as one rauisht in contēplation thereof, he delighted in nothing more then the practise of his Charmes and Incantations, but after the contract betweene the Diuell and himselfe, he was able (as afterwards himselfe testifies) by onely the breath of his mouth, to inflame with lust all those on whom he was pleased to breath, wherwith he so bewitched Mistris Victoire Corbier, yt she was cōstrained to lust after him immeasurably, which he effected in the month of April last past. Before the discouerie of these his impudent villanies, he was exceedingly reuerenced, and very much respected by the Marcellian Vulgar, yea in all places wheresoeuer he came, aswell for the religious apparance he carried, as also for the great learning was knowne to be in him: for such was his fluence of spéech, that he could so tickle and charme the eares of his Audience, that it contented them perpetually to heare him, so mellifluously did he hony them, who were abused poore soules in their attention, &amp; falsely deluded with his Eloquence: which occasioned that he was then reputed for a most religious and deuout Priest, seruing for a pretious Antidote against the poysonsome infection of sinne, as their shallow vnderstandings belieued for firme truth, who notwithstanding shortly after had knowledge of his diabolicall commerce. He held (notwithstanding he was in the Diuels hereditarie possession) all his Presbiterall functions, so that amongst others, he being one day in a solitarie place, there hapned to come vnto him on Mistresse Magdalen of the Marish, requesting him to heare her confession (who was then vtterly ignorant of his fatall relinquishment of Religion) which at that time was graunted her by the abhominable Impostor.
            This poore innocent maide therefore, humbled at the

féete of this Uulture, and requesting his counsell and aduise for reformation of her former errors and transgrestions, heard no other perswasions to come from this Diuelish seducer, but cleane to shake off the zeale and desire that thee had to be reconciled to God; and further intimated vnto her, (with painted and colourable speeches, not fitte to bee once mentioned amongst Christians,) that it shee would liue the rest of her life happily, he would be the meanes that shee should obtaine and enioy whatsoeuer pleasure shee could desire or wish for. In this his perswasion, the prophane dogge breathed vpon the countenance of this poore afflicted maide, who in that moment was inchaunted and intangled in the snares of this sacrilegious villaine. Surely Hell it selfe had placed in the bodie of this tyrant, some ghastlie and vncleane spirit, to bee as an Instrument and guide to this accursed Inchaunter.
            Oh Heauens! Is it possible that such a hell-hound should bee permitted to liue amongst men? who inraged with an Infernall Furie, drawes and allures such sillie soules vnto him, as are not well grounded and confirmed in Faith; as we may plainely perceiue in this silly soule: who being catcht by the deceitfull ginnes of this disloyall Apostate, forsaking her God, and giuing credence to the wordes and proferd promises of this accursed Impostor; shée also (as hee formerly had done, and thereto now perswaded her) giues herselfe soule and bodie to the Diuell, whom at that instant she saw in the forme of a man.
            In which course of his, that they of Marcelles could not in so long space, discouer the Tragicall trecheries of this their so wel-beloued flatterer, whose Charmes &amp; inchantments procured, that they estéemed him their spirituall minion, was wonderfull: for so excessiue was their boūdles affection, that to haue exempted him from legal punishments, they would haue (most of them) parted with all their wealth. Blinde Marcellians, that could thinke it

possible for one man by his priuate studies, to attaine to such perfection in all humane sciences, and in so short a moment, the like whereof, the best Learned, by their manie yeares industrie, could neuer attaine vnto: neither could bee without his ayde, who continually ceased not to reueale those things vnto him, wherewith hee fedde the greedie expectation of those, whose conuersation hée most desired. Nor but that in the publike viewe of a whole Court of Parliament in Prouince, hée was in particular accused and conuinced of these insuing Articles, and thereof being condemned, was put to death in Aix, a Towne neare therevnto They would not yet retaine any beliefe, concerning his offences: But now too late these Iudiciall proceedings haue inforced you to assure your selues, concerning his abuses &amp; delusions, wherewith yée were blinded, in cherishing and pampering him so tenderly, whose quarters rather would haue adorned the Gates of your Citie, which may be accounted happie, in being at the last cleansed of so dangerous and fearefull a plague.
            But let vs returne againe vnto the said Mistris Magdalen of the Marish, whō though she had fréely giuē her selfe, (by the cursed allurements of this accursed Curre) to the Diuell, &amp; by his further perswasions, diuers times more fully confirmed the said contract; receiuing diuers marks of the Diuell, in seuerall parts of her bodie. A thing testified by the Fathers and Doctors of S. Maxime, and exprest in the sentence or death, denounced against the saide Gaufredy, shee was notwithstanding so incessantly afflicted, both in bodie and soule, when shee considered the daunger of her ruine, that posting in the perturbation of her wauering selfe conflict, shee retires her selfe to a Religious man, desirous to reueale her sinne: acknowledging vnto him, that it was such a sinne as could not almost be forgiuen▪ the Tenor whereof, much astonished this Religious man. For which cause, he laboured her to confesse what that sinne might bee: but shee fearing the rigorous hand

of secular Iustice) made answere vnto him, that she would willingly tell him, vpon condition that she might first obtaine pardon from the chiefe president of the said Towne of Aix, which he (fearing that she had entered into some practise or complotted some Treason against his Maiestie or his estate) denied her, perswading her, how she might well obtaine this pardon after a little time, but that first it was necessarie for her to make knowne wherein she had offended: his perswasions could not preuaile with her, till such time as he did condiscend to her desired pardon.
            Now the matter knowne, and he vndertaking to procure her pardon, forthwith hastened to Marcelles to the Court of Parliament, where giuing aduertisement of what had passed, to the Lord President, &amp; declaring vnto him what words the said Magdalen had vsed, inferring how for the seruice he ought to the Kings Maiestie and publike Iustice, considering the wonderful detriment that France had sustained in former times, by such trayterous Paracides and blood suckers, as she had brought forth, he was come in that manner. The Lo: President delayed not to send with this Religious man many officers to Marcelles, At whose comming, he fained to be possest of her pardō, which she beléeuing, was rauished with incomparable ioy, which was no sooner conceiued, but as suddenly it vanished away, for she no sooner appeared or presented herself to his Uiew, but the Officers attēding him, conueyed her presently to the said Parliament of Prouince whence she was by the commaundement of the said Lo: President, clapt vp close in a Dungeon, whither afterward was also committed Mistresse Victoire Courbier, but so as neither could haue conference with any. Not long after which imprisonment, report was made to the said Lo: President, that the said Magdalen of the Marish (being shut vp in a place so disconsolate and miserable, would haue murthered her selfe, which to preuent, she was forthwith caused to be brought before him in presence of

all the chiefe counsellors, and Assistants of that Court, whether being come, wofully blubbered with her continued teares, and almost dead with sorrowe: astonished to behold those, who by their iust doontes, punish crimes committed: she was examined by a Counsellor Commissioner, reputed thereunto by the said Parliament and herevpon sworne to deliuer nothing but truth: when, calling to minde what she had perpetrated, feare and trembling surprising her without ye vsuall inforcements of racke and forments, she openly confessed, how she repairing to the afore said MaisterGaufredy, requesting him to examine and cleare her conscience, he in manner aforesaid, was the cause and originall of her vtter ouerthrow and perdition. Upon which her confession a warrant (by the instance of the Kings Atturnie Generall) was sent out for the bodily apprehension of the foresaid Lewis Gaufredy Priest, who being accordingly apprehended, was committed to the said common gale of Aix in prouince, till such time as it was conuenient for him, to make his open appearance in the said court, whether he was very speedily called, and as exactly examined of the crimes imputed vnto him, both by the foresaid Magdalen and Mistres Victoire Corbier But herein behold the deceitfull potencie of that old and subtill deceiuer the Diuell, who had fortified this his champion with such seeming Innocencie, and inabled him so much beyond all vulgar exspectation, that the whole Bench were not able to conuince or cast him: which thing being wel considered by one of the most ancient Commissioners, who perceiuing much subtiltie in his answeres moued by a feruent zeale to boult out the truth, he earnestly requested the residun of those Noble Commissioners to ioyne with him in prayer vnto ye all-searching eye of the omnipotent, that he for his owne glorie sake would vouchsafe them power and meanes to discouer the falcities and illusions of this pernitious miscreant. Which ended, the said Graue Counsellor, now better armed then before, to incounter

with this grand Champion of Sathan, let fly at him, so sacred an admonition, seconded with so terrible a commination, that all his former shifts, and glosings (now broken staues of defence) so failed him, that the re

               ue of his answeres &amp; allegations were so variable, (being nothing now but fearefull stamerings) that his owne words serued for testimonie sufficient to conuince him, which vpon a little farther arguing, caused him to confesse, as followeth.

                           IT is about some 13. or 16. yéeres since I began to reade on a Magicke Booke, which I had from an Unckle of mine, about the same time, &amp; during these entercourses, the Diuell appeared vnto mee in humane shape, apparelled like a Gallant Fellowe. At the first confcontment I was affrighted, and then I was possessed with two verie badde affections, which I had affected of long time before; One was of Ambition, to liue in great reputation in the world, but especially amōgst honest men; and the other was, a certaine disordinate affection, to inioy the companie of some speciall Maidens.
                        The aboue▪mentioned Diuell (surnamed Lucifer) saide thus vnto me in my chamber, betwixt him and mée; what should I giue thee, to enioy on the other side, that which I would desire of thee? I being glad of such an offer, made answere, whatsoeuer he could wish from me, onely that he would aske it; and I would willingly giue him the same.
                        He then replyed, why giue me thy selfe, and all the goods which thou possessest: I made answere, that I would willingly giue my selfe vnto him, with all other goods, which any way touched, or concerned my particular: but as for the validitie of the Sacraments, which I administred to others, that I would not graūt him; wherunto he agreed: being contented wt my former offer; &amp; so we couenāted together,

&amp; came to an agréement, he required fome solemne promise of me, which I set downe in writing as followeth.
                        
                           I Lewys Gaufredy renounce all my goods, as well spirituall as temporall, which any wayes may be conferred vpon me, on the behalfe of God, the Uirgin Marie; and all the Saints, both hee and shee of Paradise: and more particularlie, from my Patrone, Saint Iohn Baptist, S. Peter, S. Paule, and S. Francis: and so giue my selfe, both bodie and soule, to you Lucifer here present, with all the goods which I shall euer possesse, (excepting the validitie or the Sacraments, in regard of them, that at my hāds shall receiue the same;) And hereunto I doe subscribe &amp; witnes. See here me? the Tenor of the promise.
                        This being done, I demanded wherin he would satisfie 
                        
                        I confesse that I kept the abouenamed booke of Magike,
                            vnder the Mantle-tree of my Chamber-chimney, on the right hand, fastened with a naile, to a woodden boorde.
                        I confesse how I tooke extreame pleasure to read on the  same Booke, &amp; as soone as I read on the same booke, the Diuell would appeare vnto me in forme aboue mentioned.
                        I confesse that two or thrée dayes after the said premise, the Diuell returned, (as formerly hee promised) and then  he said vnto mee, that by the vertue of my breath, I should enflame with my Loue, all the Women and Maides that I desired to enioy; so that my breath did but come to their nostrilles: And so I beganne to breath on all those that I had any liking vnto.
                        I confesse that the Diu
                              •
                           ll brought me a scedule, signed  by himselfe, comprehending the vertue and power of my breath, which yet lyes by mee.
                        I confesse that I breathed on about a thousand Maids  and women, taking great delight to see them transported with my Loue: And speaking of many particulars, I haue many times said to their Fathers: Your Daughters haue 
                                 •
                              s much as they can well carrie about them; without fur

                           her expressing my selfe.
                        
                           I confesse that I familiarlie frequented the house of  
                           Monsieur de la Palud, a Gentleman of Marceilles, and by reason of my great reputation, I was very welcome thither. Hee had three Daughters verie exceeding faire, well brought vp, and merueilous deuout: I had a desire to enioy one of them, called Mistris Magdalen, but her mother lookt narrowly to her, so as I could haue no meanes to come to the sight of her, and therefore I first breathed on her mother, to the end that she might bring her to my chā
                           ber, and be confident in me whiles I was in her house, the which I easily obtained: so as being oftentimes in company with the said Magdalen, I kissed her, and more also.
                        I confesse furthermore: that I breathed on many women, contenting my selfe onely to sée them carried away headlong with my Loue, and taking singular pleasure therein, without proceeding any further▪
                        
                        I confesse that the first time that I would enioy Mistris
                            
                           Magdalen, I laite my hand on her forehead, &amp; there where the Graces had lodged her Uirginitie, and shée auoucheth the words I then spake.
                        I confesse, that I breathed on this Damosell manie  times. For the oftner I breathed, the madder she was of my loue and enioyance. I desired that the effect of our concupiscences might come from her. And so déepely I infected her by my breath, as she was ready to die with impatience, when I was not with her▪ for shée hunted after me in the Fieldes and in the Church, and desired to haue mee alwayes about her Fathers: And thus I had knowledge of her at my pleasure.
                        I confesse that thrée dayes after, I gaue her to a Diuell, called Fimodes, to assist, serue, and preserue her: and to heate her the more in my loue, when I saw her so transported with ioy &amp; delight therein, and euen to bende her knées to my desires, I thus debated with her.
                        
                           Magdalene the height of my desires, and shée for whose sake, I haue so often called on the internall powers, I will

marrie thee to the Prince of Diuels, Belzebub by name: She freely consented there vnto: And then I caused him to come in forme of a Gentleman, which being done, I saide so Magdalen how it was requisite, that shee must make a promise to Belzebub the Diuell, the which I set downe vnto her in manner as followeth.
                        I here protest in the presence of God, of all the celestiall  Court, of you M. Lewys Gaufredy, and of the Diuell Belzebub heere present, that I absolutely renounce with all my heart, all my power, &amp;  all my might, God the Father, God the Sonne, &amp; God the holie Ghest; the most holie mother of God; all the Angels, but especially my good Angell, the Passion of our Lord Iesus Christ, and his blood, and all the merites thereof; my part in Paradise, all the good inspirations that God may hereafter put into me, all praiers that haue bene, or may be made for me; I further protest, that I absolutely giue my selfe, bodie, soule, force, and power, to the Diuell, and you, withdrawing my selfe presently out of the hands of God, that I may entirely fall into the hāds of the Diuell. In Testimonie whereof, I doe signe and subscribe the same with my blood.
                        
                           Magdalen saith, that M. Lewys Gaufredy, in the presence  of the Diuell Belzebub, pricked her with a slender thinne Bookin he had, made like a néedle, in the ioynt of the right hands little finger, that so he might come to blood, wherewith to subscribe the said promise.
                        I confesse further, that I made seuen or eight promises  to hun, tending to divers ends, all concerning the Diuell, and mee: and I brooke (or went backe) from thrée or foure of them, once when he brought me a certaine number.
                        
                        I also confesse, that the Diuell detained the iurisoiction and custodie of all the aboue said promises, as well from Magdalen as from my▪ selfe, to carry them, whether hee would, and when he thought good.
                        I likewise confesse, that the Diuel said vnto me, that if I  burnt the said promises, he would make such an horror and

terror, that I should fall downe dead to the ground.
                        I also confesse, that I kept all the said promises in my  chamber, with the aboue mentioned booke of Magicke, and one day when I came from Aix, which was the second time that I went thither to speake with the Fathers, Michaell, Iacobyne, and Antonie Capuchin, when I came backe to my chāber, I burnt the said booke of Magicke, not vpon any intention to amend my life, but rather for feare to be found possest therewith, the Ashes of which booke, are yet in my chamber, for the couenants▪ I was much astonished when I found them not, because the diuell had carried them away, euen as I told those Fathers.
                        I confesse moreouer: that the first time we goe to the  Sabbath, all Sorcerers, Witches, and Magicians, are marked with a diuels little finger, who hath an office and charge, thereto belonging.
                        I confesse that when this diuell markes, one shall féele  a little piercing heate: and there where he toucheth, the flesh remaines somewhat sunck, and hollow.
                        I further confesse, that I was marked at the Sabbath, by my owne consent, and that I also caused Magdalen there to be marked. She is marked in the head, in the heart, in the bellie, in the thighes, in the legges, in the feete, and in many other parts of her bodie: she hath also a needle in her thigh that she féeles not, which I sée him put in, and when the needle enters, you would say, that one pierced a péece of parchment.
                        I also confesse, that there are many sorcerers, inchaunters, and Magicians, who couer their markes, but afterwards they growe againe of themselues, and returne to their ancient forme: for this marke remaines alwaies with them, by reason of their vow of perseuerance, which they make in particular, when they giue themselues to the diuell.
                        I confesse also, that the said markes are made for a protestation

and vow that they shall alwaies continew good, and faithfull seruants to the diuell throughout the whole course of their life.
                        I confesse in like manner: that I haue bene abroad at  the Saboth in diuers places, that is to say: at la Baume de Rolla
                                 •••
                               La, Baume de Loubiers, &amp; that twice, or thrise, I desired to goe to Saint Baume And▪ thither once I went expressely, to cause the diuell to bring backe Magdalen, and to carrie her through all the woods of Saint Baume.
                        
                        I confesse in like manner: that when I would goe to  the Saboth I would sometimes put my selfe out at an open windowe, otherwhiles I went out of my chamber, locking my chamber doore, and putting my keyes into my pocket, Lucifer would then take me, and in an instant, I was transported to the place, where the Saboth was held, remaining there, somtimes, on, two, thrée, or fower houres, and for the most part, according to my humor, and occasions.
                        I declare and testifie: that at the entrie into the Saboth, all enchaunters, sorcerers, and Magicians, doe worship and hoimnage to the diuell, euery one according to his degrée. That is to say, the Enchaunters worship him groueling vpon the earth: The sorcerers being on their knées, and bending their bodies, and the Magicians, in that they are the principalls of the Saboth, bend themselues onely on their knées.
                        I confesse, that as soone as we are entred into the Sabboth, there is a diuell that is commaunded in particular, to make euery one of them renounce God, all the Saints but more specially Saint Francis.
                        
                        I also confesse, that I haue bene often at the Saboth  with Magdalen and cald her to swallow downe Caracters out of a spoone, by the ministration of diuels, and so others for my selfe, the more to enrage her, in my loue.
                        I also confesse, that at Saboth I had knowledge of her, and of a Princesse of Freefeland.
                        
                        
                           I confesse, that I haue abused many Maides, whom I  breathed vpon, out of the Saboth.
                        I confesse also: that the diuell is the true Ape of the  Church, performing at his Sabeth whatsoeuer is performed in the Church.
                        Also I confesse, that they baptise in these Saboths, and  euery sorcerer makes a particular vow, giuing himselfe to the diuell, that he shall cause all his children to be baptised in the Saboth (if it to may be) as also names are imposed on euery one of them, which came to the Saboth, different from their proper names.
                        I further confesse: that at Baptisme they vse water, sulphure, &amp; salt, sulphure makes them slaues to the diuell, and salt confirmes their baptisme, to the diuels seruice.
                        I confesse moreouer: that the forme and prescription  thereof is, to baptise in the name of Lucifer, Belzebub and other diuels, making the signe of the Crosse, beginning it cleane backward, then prosecuting it by the féete, and ending in the head.
                        I confesse moreouer: that there was twelue Priests at  the Saboth, and how each one saies Masse, in his turne; the said Priests are set in very high places, as being the principalls of the Saboth: but there was one a notable ignorant, and blockheaded fellow.
                        Also I confesse, that whensoeuer I was at the Saboth, I haue heard Masse, and vnderstood it well, but when it came to my turne, I caused it to be said by an other Priest of the Saboth.
                        I likewise confesse, that at the beginning of Masse, euery  one prostrates himselfe on the ground, and a diuell it is that assists at Masse.
                        I confesse, that the candles which are burnt during  Masse, are of powder, and sulphure, and in stead of a torch at the eleuation of that accursed sacrament, the diuell assistant makes a great light, which stinkes exceedingly.
                        
                           Also I confesse, that the Priest which saies Masse is carried  to the Saboth by his proper diuell, hauing on a violet colourd Chousill.
                        I confesse, that the bell which rings to Masse, at the  
                           Sanctus and the Sacre, is of horne, the clapper being of wood, to make it sound.
                        Further I confesse, that wheresoeuer mention is made  of the names of Iesus, of the holy Uirgin, or of the Saints they are taken away, and in their stead, they put too the names of diuels, it requires some studie to say Masse in these Saboths.
                        I further confesse, that they offer and consecrate vnleauened  bread, and when there is none, they consecrate ordinarie bread, taking most ordinarily, the bottome crust of some loaues.
                        I also confesse, that many crusts &amp; péeces are consecrated, to be communicated to the Assistants, and when there is not vnder crusts enough, they take the vpper ends.
                        I confesse: that they pronounce on high, the words of  consecration, whether it be of the body, or of the blood, and when the Sacrament is eleuated, euery one renounceth God alowd, and cryes, Maister helpe vs, addressing themselues to Lucifer, and other diuels.
                        I confesse, that they vse to consecrate blood in a vessel, and a very great bason, and after consecration made, the Priest that saies Masse, bathes therein, and then sprinkles it on the assistants.
                        I further confesse: that euery one takes of it in their  hands, and poores it on their heads, saying: his blood be vpon vs; and vpon our children.
                        I confesse, that all the crosses which are made during  the masse are made cleane a reuerse or backward, as aboue mentioned.
                        Further I confesse, that when one saith: Agnus dei,
                            and Domine non sum dignus: euery one being enraged in hart, crie out, like desperate mē, Addressing their words to

the Diuell, O Maister, bee euer our helpe and aide.
                        
                        I confesse furthermore: that euery one is bound to communicate, &amp; when he does not, he is bound, to giue his part to be eatē to a Diuell, who is trāsformed into a Dog: And I remember well, that the diuell, whose office this is, was sharply reprehended by others, for not discharging it well.
                        I confesse, how there be certaine Enchauntors, who are  charged to bring a great dogge out of their villages, to eate vp that part of the communion which others will not eate.
                        I also confesse that when one saith: Ite Missa est; They  say: Depart you all, in the Diuells name.
                        
                        Further I confesse, that all the Usurers, Enchaunters, Sorcerers, &amp; Magicians▪
                            are bound when any Childe dies, which was baptised in the sabboth; to goe disenterre, and bring the same to the sabboth, there to be eaten by Diuels.
                        I confesse that when any dies at the sabboth▪
                            all the Diuells, 
                           Enchanters, &amp; Magicians, request him to stand firms to the Diuell, &amp; when hee is dead, they all carrie him together to the Sea, or some Riuer, wherintoo they throw him, from the toppe of some Rocke, or else they close him vp in same Caue, there to preserue him.
                        I confesse also: that the Diuell neuer left mée, except it  were, when I went into the Capuchines Church; &amp; their he would stay for me at the Church doore.
                        
                        Lastly I confesse, that it is about 14. or 15. yéeres agoe, since I gaue my selfe to the diuell, body &amp; soule, renouncing all that which any wayes I might hope for, from the mercies of GOD.

               THese are the times, when crueltie is put in practise, by the force and power of sorcerie, for we daily sée euident effects hereof, as may be discerned in his latter and accursed deuise practised vpon a young maide, about some ten yeares of age, the which I will not faile, to diuulge and make knowne vnto all men knowing well, that the little labour I shall herein take, will yeeld them no lesse contentment, then such an argument and subiect can deserue. And therefore I request euery one, that he will be as patient to bestow the reading thereof, as I am in the writing and publication of the same, seeing this Tyrannie deserues as well to be listned vnto, as to be written and composed: for I know it will strike griefe and sorrowe into their hearts, that will but patiently vouchsafe  the reading hereof, where ending my introduction, to begin my report: I

humbly pray God that it will please him, to giue euer one a discreete vnderstanding with amendment of life, intreating likewise the reader to hold me excused, though I set it not downe in such exquisite, and fluent phrase: as perchance some other would.
            Now shall I be able to expresse this strange crueltie, without distilling teares from mine eyes (apt to put me in remembrance, of such a wickednesse, whensoeuer I doe but take my penne in hand▪ or how can it be, that any one in reading this tragicall subiect, should not consider and weigh my hardines and courage, though but in the very hearing, of these murderous and miserable attempts of the world? alas! I suppose not any one of you, would be exempted from hearkning to them, and that you will be readie with me▪ to pray vnto the celestiall Monarch, that it would please him of his mercie, to giue an end, to all sorcerous acts, and Incests, which daily vere and afflict Gods Saints vpon the earth, as well in preuenting poore humaine Creatures of their continuall prouisions, and nourishments, as further in bereaning, and vntimely taking from them their liues.
            Euen as we may more clearely vnderstand, by these fower Sorceresies or rather in déed Tygresses, or hagges, who committed this outrage, vpon a poore young maide, who little thought her last howre had bene so reare, or that these witches, had determined to vse vpon her, so brutish a Tyrannie: but indéed what man, or woman, would euer formerly haue dreamt of such an accident, more then this fillie maide did, who was then walking along an hedge, gathering of blacke berries, being in companie with some other little children, and specially with a little brother of her owne, when these sorceresses thus plotted her perdition: alas! most accursed Sorceresse, thy miscreant heart, was euen then possessed with a diuel, when by thy bewitching tongue, yt didst induce this poore Gyrle to followe thée to a place, where thou meantest to

commit this butchery, and yet was her fortune more hard, when yu gauest her little brother a péece of money, a great Blancke, to the ende hee should returne to the place from whence thou hadst stolne her, for then came all thy poyson and venome to a full head, when she poore soute entring into thy house, thou gauest her virginity to an ouglie Ruffian, who no wayes considering the euill that would thereof ensue, violated and robbed her of the robe of her pudicitie:
            And yet thou then shewedst a farre more hellish cruelty, when with thy treacherous hand thou diddest begore thy knife in her Blood▪ thinking by this murder, to haue saued thine owne life But alas! yet didst thou worse then all the rest, whē thou drewest her little heart out of her breast, together with her Lyuer, to mingle them with her blood: with which yu thoughtest to bring to an end thy Sorcerie.
            Ah inuiolable heart! Ah trecherous hagge; thou thoughtest▪ GOD was not of power to discouer thy malice, but most iustly yu wert reuealed by Innocents, who by Gods permission, went along, &amp; conducted this young Gyrle, to the place, where thou and thy complices, put her to death: True it is, that thou wert not conuicted vpon their accusation, for being imprisoned, thou couldst not be made to confesse the truth, and therefore at that instant, thou wert deliuered.
            But God the Author of all Truth and Iustice, would not suffer thée lōger to liue, after ye perpetration of so fearful a murder &amp; tyrannie, but stroke into them such a feare, as both yu and thy cōplices would needs flie away, &amp; to that end selling daily thy moueables, that afterwards yu mightest make an escape, &amp; saue thy life, &amp; so by this means thou wert discouered, euen by thine owne neighbors, &amp; iustly accused; whē yet once more to couer thy dissimulation, thou causedst the flesh of this poore innocent Gyrle to be burnt &amp; consumde in an hot Ouen, to the ende, thou mightest cast the ashes afterwards into the water, or performe some other Diuellish tricks therewith.
            
               For thou canst not denie the selling of her blood to a Sorcerer: by which 
                  〈◊〉
               
               ▪ would doe hurt to the Fruites of the earth, and more to mans bodie; and that thou wert taken in the manner, euen like a Théefe, that meant to robbe his neighbor, that did but watch for his comming. Of all the which, the Iustice being the sec
                  •
               d time aduertised; yu wert then conuinced: And yet this Infernall Ympe, would not for all this reueale the truth, neither permit that anie bodie should goe into the house, to seeke for the Gyrle; but they rather barricadoed thēselues to stand out. When publike Iustice (not wtstanding their resistāce) cōdemned them to be worthie of death, &amp; guiltie of the offence: For entring violently into the said house, they opened the Ouen, where they then found the Ashes and Boanes of this poore Maide, within a poake prouided for that purpose, that so they might bee cast into some corner, and the murther by them committed, by this meanes couered: But all these matters comming to light, shee was put into close Prison, and shée that committed the murther, and caused the yong Maide to be defloured, was condemnd to be drawen vpon an hurdle through the Towne, holding a Torche, and the knife in her hand: and then the same being cutte off, her Armes, Thighes, and Pappes, were pluckt asunder by mammockes, with hote pyncers. And lastly, her bodie was throwne aliue into the fire.
            The names of the chiefe of them, was Michell the toothles: wife to Iohn Brunet, some thréescore yeares of Age, of the parish of Blouuille; The other thrée, were Marguerite Gallon, Iane Guerin, and Susan Mercer; who were likewise drawne vpon an Hurdle, through the Towne, in their smockes, and hauing suffered the Tortures extraordinarie, they were first hanged, and then their bodies burnt, for consenting to the wicked practise of this Sorceresse▪ notwithstanding their Appeale to Roan. And thus you haue heard an end of their Diuelish liues.
            But now consider the grieuous laments that the sorrowfull

mother of this vnhappie Gyrle made, for the losse of her childe, which (of such a suddaine) was taken &amp; &amp; from her presence) which had neuer come to passe, but that Procession then going about in her parish, she was stollen away, and no knowledge could be had of her in the world; which was an occasion, that she grew almost into dispaire, neither could shée continue still in a place, but franticklie went running vp and downe, heere and there, leauing no place vnsearcht, to learne some tydings of her: But all her hope being lost, and finding no bodie that could giue her any notice of her, she in the ende killed herselfe: For being in this manner trouble some to all her neighbours, they could not but be moued and became as sorrowfull as shee herselfe. Wherefore they laboured to make her forget her sorrow and griefe: But could not possiblie effect it; but she rather mournd still the more, and sobd for her Childe, saying:
            Alas! my deare Neighbours, if you haue hid her in any place let me know it, to the end I may be quiet, &amp; haue her bodie; &amp; then I alone will lamēt her death. And thou my swéete Boy (speaking to her yong sonne) Tell me where yu leftest thy Sister? Leade mee good loue to the place, that so I may méete wt some honest men, that may direct mee. O woe &amp; alasse! well may I curse the houre, when I suffered thée to straggle from mee, I would to God I had beene then in my graue!
            The little Childe who was yet but young, and therefore could not tell, nor shew the place whether he had ledde his Sister, nor decipher the Sorceresse that had stollen her away; yet by signes he shewed his sorrowfull mother, the place where they were gathering Hedge-berries together, when (the accursed &amp; vnknowne Hagge) gaue him a little péece of siluer, to the ende hee should leaue her, and that her self might thus haue the better meanes to compasse her intent, and dispoyle this poore Gyrle of her virginitie, by deliuering her into the hands of a fowle Ruffian: when this

wretched Mother, (knowing the innocencie of her owne Child) debated thus to her selfe; Alas▪ What bootes it me to aske of him, Where is thy Sister, my good chicke? Ah▪ but what doe I meane to wander thus vp &amp; downe? What make I so long time in this place? Oh mercifull God, surely some villanous Rogue may peraduēture haue taken thy virginity, and afterwards, further tainted himselfe with thy blood. But what's this I say? who could haue so barbarous an heart? I cannot belieue it fell out with her in such sort; when returning againe to her selfe, she said. What may I then suppose is become of my child? why heeres no place where she could doe her selfe any hurt? And thus her parents searched all ouer, but could heare no word of her, nor méete with other satisfaction, then to lament the losse of their sillie young Daughter, who peraduenture had alreadie, vndergone the rage and crueltie of this hellish Megara. And for the space of one or two dayes, they could not remaine pacified, but continued in this Inquisition, while they met with a childe, who had conducted her along to that part &amp; place, where the miscreāt creature cut her throate. But they durst not bee so bolde at that instāt to goe thither, without taking some aduise therevpon; fearing least some greater inconuenience might arise thereupon. The blood of this poore Maide beganne now to calll for vengeance at Gods hands: and then God permitted, that the murder committed vpon her should be manifested as it was.
            For hauing obtained a Warrant from the Iustice, they apprehended at the same instant, the shamelesse Sorceresse, but shée being resolu'd on all mischiefe, would not confesse her fault, but was stout and obstinate in her denialls: So that her deliuery was wrought, to the charge and cost of the innocent maides Parents, procured by the rest of that diabolical crew; which wrought their greater sorrow and discomfort then before, being now voyde of all meanes to discouer the trueth, or to come to the knowledge of their

Childes ruine, though bitter griefe neuer left their harts, whensoeuer she came into their remembrance: this matter séeming wholly to be blowne ouer, and no further spéech nor talke hereof vsed.
            This murderesse, at that very time had not yet committed the butcherie, as afterwards her selfe confessed: but the Gyrle was close shut vp in a chamber, whether this Sorceresse, with the rest of her adherents presently went, and so amongst them presently cut her throate. Alas poore heart, shée being no wayes able to resist their violence, said: Alas, my good mistresses, Alas, Kill me not for Gods sake, saue my life, and suffer me to goe &amp; see my Mother once againe, and I vow vnto you, no bodie shall know, what hath bene done vnto me in your house. But then they all layd hold vpon her, and held her, while this old witch cut her throate with a great Knife, and not content therewith they pluckt the heart and lyuer out of her bellie, and stéeped them in her blood, that afterwards they might giue them to a Sorcerer, who had bought them of them, consuming the rest of her bodie within an Ouen, putting the Ashes thereof into a poake, as before I declared vnto you.
            Now this damnable consort, thought themselues out of all perill, and daunger, but it fell out quite contrarie; for they were all taken, vpon the instant, that they meant to haue fled the Countrey. And notwithstanding all former discharges, they were bewraied and accused by their neighbours: They being the second time attainted &amp; conuicted; For finding the Ashes and Bones of this innocent maide within the Ouen; they were carried to the Towne, &amp; presented to the Iustices, when clearely perceiuing the trueth of so pittifull an Accident, all men lift vy their eyes to heauen, their hearts being replenished with vnmeasurable griefe, All the standers by weeping most bitterly, and exclayming, how vnworthy a thing it were, that this murder should escape vnpunished Nay rather, that they should not be put vnto some extraordinarie cruell and tormēting

death; so as to death they were all condemned, &amp; endured those paines &amp; tortures, which we formerly declared vnto you: But alas! what good got y• sorrowful mother by this? could this mittigate or appease her woe? can this giue againe vnto her the life of her child? alas, alas! notwithstanding this Infernall hagge suffered Condigne punishment, for the reuenge of her Childes death, yet did not this wipe out of her heart, the remembrance thereof, nor the griefe which daily afflicted her, when she saw but the place where her child was violated, and most vnhappily murdered. And you the rest of her Friends, &amp; Kinsfolkes, can you euer forget such an opprobrie: can this damsell euer slippe out of your remēbrance, whom you so dearely loued? no certainely, for then your hearts should be too much destitute of common humanitie: In like manner all you men, &amp; woemen, that were present at their deaths, will you not alwaies carrie in minde such a butcherie and Tyrannie, will you not euer remember the day of their punishment? you mothers also which haue children, subiect in the like case▪ to the like perill and daunger as hapned to this woman, would you not lament? ah would you not gréeue for the violent death of your owne blood? I verily thinke your hearts would be surprised, with as great bitternes and affliction, as hers was after the rapture of her childe, next which is more, the remembrance of the very day when you came to the knowledge of her death would torment you. For my part I know not one in the world, that would faile in so kind and naturall an office, and therefore I neither blame father or mother in this point, (except the mother in regard of her too vehement sorrow which caused her desperately to kill her selfe) for who can preserue themselues from miserable afflictions, except by the speciall grace and goodnes of the celestiall mouer, who preserues and kéepes this our life, and conducts it to the place of its saluation. He, he it is, that

vouchsafe vs his saueguard, &amp; no other. If therefore, we euer loued his sanctitie and holinesse, and neuer heard of a more lamentable, and pittiful spectacle then this was, we ought alwayes to beare and carrie it in minde: For who would haue thought that a maide only of fourtéene yeeres of Age, the daughter of Marguerite Gallon, could haue had the stomacke &amp; boldnesse, to deliuer this Maid of ten yeares olde, and to sell and betray her into the handes of others; for so small a summe of money, shee receiuing in all, but (three &amp; twentie souz:) a base piece of Coyne.
            Surely I cannot thinke shee could performe this villanie without her mothers consent, &amp; yet her selfe alone was in the greatest part the cause of this hard Accident, which likewise did not remaine vnpunished: For she endured and suffered the like death and punishment as her mother did: shée, as her mother before her, deseruing the fire before her death. But thus this Innocent maid, whome shee sold to this accursed Enchanteresse, cruelly lost her life, to all the peoples great griefe in generall, &amp; euery ones high discontentment. You sée therefore, how this Prodigie came to bee discouered, and how a sillie Damzell was destroyed, through the bloodie crueltie of most miscreant creatures, who thought their vniust malice, would neuer haue come to light. But GOD not permitting them long to suruiue, suffered likewise that they should come into the hāds of deuine Iustice, the which (by his Prouidence, did condemne them, and the punishment of a most cruell death, they haue suffered and endured, although nothing so terrible as their enormious impietie deserued.
            Where finishing this our present discourse; Let vs pray vnto GOD, that it would please him, to bring to an end this worldes vnhappinesse, and to diuert all the impious desseignes and practises of the wicked: drawing them rather, by his Diuine prouidence, to repentance and conuersion from their sinnes; to the end that those benefites may

be preserued and blessed vpon the Earth, which are most requisite and necessarie for vs, for the vse and peregrination of this our Temporall and Transitorie life, whereof
