            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                     Iohn 6. Verſ. 27.
                  
                  Labour not for the meat, vvhich periſheth, but for that meat vvhich endureth, vnto euerlaſting life, which the Sonne of man ſhall giue vnto you, for him hath God the Father ſealed.
               
            
            AMonge our manifold enormities, there is not any one, which more grieues the Lord Ieſus, and vvhich doth make him more to be offended vvith vs, then vvhen vve abuſe, either himſelfe, or his bleſſed ordinances to peruerſe ends: therfore of all things vvherevnto, vvee are to looke to, in our

ſelues, this is one of the chiefeſt, leaſt in ſhevve of ſeeking after Chriſt, &amp; in comming to his holy ordinances, vve thereby increaſe our guiltines, &amp; prouoke the Lord to vvrath, and indignation againſt vs.
            VVe knovv vvhat fearefull iudgments the Corinthians did bring vpon themſelues, for not eating the Lords ſupper, as they ought. For vvhich abuſe of that holy ordinance, the Lord plagued them, vvith ſundry diſeaſes, and ſickneſſes, and diuerſe kinds of deaths: ſo zealous is the Lord, of keeping his holy ordinances, from the abuſe, &amp; contempt of men. See 1. Cor chap. 11.
            VVee are not ignorant alſo of the ſeueritie vſed by God, againſt Nadab, and Abihu, the Sonnes of Aaron, for offring of ſtrang fire before the Lord, in conſuming them both vvith fire

that came out from the Lord, ſee Leuit. 10.
            The like example haue vvee of the teſtimonie of Gods anger, againſt Vzzah (as example to all them, that vſe not the holy things of God aright nor reſpectfully) vvho preſuming cō
               trarie to the ordinance of God, to touch the Arke. Though vpō a good zeale, to ſtay it vvhen he did ſee it like to fall, vvas ſtrucken to death by the Lord.
            Let vs remember vvhat the Lord did to king Vziah, for attempting to enter in to the ſanctuary, to offer incenſe before the Lord, vvhich belonged only to the Prieſt to doe, in ſtriking him vvith a leaproſie all the daies of his life, 2. Chro. cap. 26.
            
               Annanias and Saphirah are documents to this day of the Lords ſore diſpleaſure againſt all thoſe, vvho

pretending faith, loue, and zeale, and liberalitie to Chriſt, and his Church, dealt hipocriticallie vvith counterfeit ſhevve, and not trulie vvith God, in any thing, concerning his vvorſhip, his glory, his ordinances, and his obedience. vvho both of them vvere puniſhed by death, for dealing falſelie vvith the Lord, in their prophane, &amp; counterfeite ſhevve, of imitating the charitable liberalitie of the Primitiue Churches, in ſelling their poſſeſſions, and bringing the price thereof to the Apoſtles feet, for the ſupport of thoſe that did vvant. See Act. 5.
            All theſe do let vs ſee, that the Lord can not abide, that any man ſhould prophane, any of his holy ordināces, or for any by-pretēce to make ſhevv, of zeale to his glorie, or deſire of his holy things: it is not poſſible, that

hee ſhould ſuffer vs to goe long vnpuniſhed, if vve doe not ſerue him in all his ordinances vvith ſinceere, &amp; vpright hearts. The truth vvhereof is confirmed by this Hiſtorie: For theſe Ievves comming vnto Chriſt, did make a great ſhevve, and deſire, to enjoy the bleſſed fellovvſhip, and communion of the Sonne of God: &amp; yet Chriſt is diſpleaſed vvith them, becauſe they ſought him not vvith vpright hearts: therfore hauing checked, and reproued them, in manifeſting, and opening the poyſon of hypocriſie, which was in their hearts, in the preceding verſe of this chapter: In this verſe vvhich vve haue novv read, hee laboureth to cure by vvholeſome medecine, the ſicknes of their ſoule, if poſſible the peruerſe diſpoſition of their hearts could be reformed.
            
               The euill that he reproues in them is this, that they ſought not after Chriſt aright: becauſe they did not ſet before themſelues, the right vſe of Chriſt in comming vnto him. They ſhould haue ſought after him, firſt, and principallie, for ſpirituall things, tending to the vvelfare of their ſoules, but they ſought after him for nothing but the foode of their bodies, and the vvelfare of this their tanſitorie life: therefore Chriſt is offended at them, &amp; ſo hee is vvith all others, vvho follovving their footſteps, come vnto him, or his ordinances in the like manner.
            Novv to remedie this euill, the Sonne of God, labours to giue them ſome vvholeſome inſtruction, in which, theſe points are to be marked. Firſt, VVhat it is that he enioynes them to? vvhich is to labour. Secondly, For

vvhat he vvill haue them to labour, &amp; that is for ſpirituall things, namely, the meate of their ſoules, and the food of eternall life. Thirdly, vvee haue to conſider, the preparation vnto this, by remouing the hindrances hereof, in repreſsing the loue of the vvorld in mens hearts. Commanding them not to labour for that meate which periſheth. Fourthly, vve haue heere ſet downe by Chriſt, an information, &amp; an inſtruction vvhere to finde this bread of life, ſince it vvere in vaine to labour for it, if vve knew not vvhere to find it. Therefore hee tells them the Sonne of man ſhall giue it vnto them. Fifthly, Here is ſet downe an argument, or reaſon of confirmation to make this good, and to ſecure the ſoule of him, that ſeeks this bread of life from Christ, that Chriſt is able, yea not only able, but alſo vvilling, and ready to giue it vnto them,

and that is ſet dovvne in theſe vvords, for him hath God the Father ſealed.
            
            Firſt then let vs ſpeake of the exhortation vvhich is to labour for that meat, vvhich endureth to eternall life.
            By this exhortation vve ſee manifeſtly, that it neuer vvas the purpoſe, nor mind of God, ſince the vvorld beganne, that men ſhould feede on any meat, either corporall, or ſpirituall, vvithout labour, and pains taking for it: you knovv, that lavve of the Apoſtle to the Theſ. the ſecond Epist. 3. chap. verſ. 10. If there be any that vvill not vvorke, the ſame man ſhall not eate: that man therefore ſhall neuer be vvorthie of heauen, that vvill take no paines for it, for if it be Gods vvill, that vvee ſhould labour, if vve vvould enioy the food

of our bodies: it muſt needs be much more his vvill, that vvee ſhould labour for the food of our ſoules. It is therefore in vaine for men euer to looke to be made pertakers of the ſupper of the lambe, and bread of heauen, if they vvill take no paines for it, there is an neceſſitie layd vpon vs to labour, for the food, both of ſoule, and bodie: it is no ſlothfull, nor careles man that God vvill feed: ſuch men therefore as thinke, to goe, to heauen ſleeping, vvithout ſeeking after heauen, and doe hope to haue Chriſt brought vnto them, vvhile they reſt in their beds, and vvill not doe ſo much, as to riſe, and let him in, vvhen he calles, and knocks at their doores, and looke to be fed vvith the food of Angels, and yet vvill not ſtir hand, nor foote to labour for it.

I ſay ſuch men can neuer expect, to haue it from God. VVe knovv it ſufficiently, rhat it is Gods vvill, and ordinance, that touching this temporall life, a man ſhould eate his bread in the ſvveat of his brovves, &amp; vve doe vvillingly vndergoe paine, &amp; labour for it: But here is all our fault, that hovvſoeuer vve be buſied, and pained for temporall things, belonging to this life: yet vve haue neither heart nor mind to take any paines for ſpirituall things. And this is one of the greateſt ſinnes of this miſerable age, vvhere in men are ſo diligent, &amp; laborious, for the things of this life, and yet ſo careles, &amp; miſerablie negligent in things concerning eternall life. VVell this vve ſay, (&amp; that truly) the greater diligence men vſe, &amp; the more paines they take about vvorldly buſineſſes: the greater ſhalbe there

conviction, and their iudgment the more terrible, in the daie of Chriſt his appearing: If they haue not beene much more painfull about ſpirituall things, vvhich do concerne eternall life. VVe ſhall heare here after vvhat need vve haue to vveane our ſelues from the cares of this vvorld, and of earthly things: becauſe it is the maine hinderance, and let, of our care, and ſolicitude for heauenly things, and therefore it muſt be firſt rooted out of the heart, before the heart can be ſet as it ought vpon ſpirituall things.
            But novv let vs conſider vvhat is cōprehended vnder this word Labour, and vvhat are the things, that the Son of God requires of vs, to be done for the attaining to this bread of life. Chriſt himſelf here after in the ſame chapter ſhevves this, in anſvvering the Ievves queſtion, vvhen they

aſked him, vvhat ſhall vve doe, that vve maye worke the vvorkes of God? Ieſus anſvvered, and ſaid vnto them, this is the vvorke of God, that you beleeue in him, vvhom he hath ſent, heere in ſteed of all vvorkes, Chriſt places but one, and that is the vvorke of beleeuing: a vvorke not of the hand, nor of the body, but a vvorke of the heart. For as a man muſt haue a mouing hand, &amp; a ſtirring body, in the buſines that belōgs to this world: ſo for obtaying of ſpiritual bleſſings, he muſt haue a ſtirring, and a beleeuing heart: his heart muſt vvorke by faith, if euer he thinke to haue any ſpirituall bleſſing from God: for it is by faith alone, that vve draw all good things from God in heauen, and by faith alone it is, that vve render to God any thing, that can be acceptable vnto him, for all though in the

Scriptures, our actions are attributed to loue: yet they are in this life more properlie attributed to faith: ſeing that faith vvorks by loue: and ſo loue being but the inſtrument of faith, and that by vvhich faith vvorketh: and this is the reaſon vvhy all the doings, and ſuffrings of the children of God, are attributed vnto faith, as you may ſee in the 11. of the Lev. for the vvhole operation of a ſpirituall man, conſiſts maynly in the vvork of beleeuing, vvithout which, vve ſhall neuer receiue ought from God, that is able to ſaue our ſoules, neither ſhall vve be able to doe ſo much, as to ſend vp one ſound deſire, or petition vnto God. To conclud in a vvord, there is no abillitie, either to ſpeake, or to doe, ought, acceptablie to God, vvithout faith.
            
               This point is of great moment, &amp; vve are to Labour aboue all things, to attaine vnto this vvorke of beleeuing, and to this end, vve are care fully, to vſe all meanes, by vvhich it pleaſeth God to vvorke faith in our hearts, as namely, the hearing of the vvord of God preached, the participation of the Lords ſupper, inſtant praier to God, vvith dayly meditations in the bleſſed vvord of God, dayly conference, &amp; talking of the holy things of God, That faith by theſe meanes be both vvrought, and nouriſhed, and dayly increaſed in our hearts, vvithout vvhich it is impoſſible, that euer vve can come to haue any feeling or ſence, either of the life, or loue of God in our ſoules, much leſſe to ſhevve forth any euidences of them in our practiſe, to the eies of men, this is that vvork vvhich

muſt haue place in all our vvorkes, &amp; ſeaſon them all before God, therefore are vve commanded, that vvhatſoeuer vve doe, vvhether vve eate, or vvhether vvee drinke, that vve doe all in the name of the Lord Ieſus, which is as much as to ſay, that vve doe all in faith, for nothing can be done in the name of the Lord Ieſus, but it muſt of neceſſitie be done in faith, this is then that which Chriſt means, vvhen he vvills vs to labour.
            Novv let vs goe forvvard: here it follovveth, that vve ſhould next ſpeake of that, for vvhich vve ſhould labour, but before vve come vnto it. VVe vvill ſpeake firſt of the preparition, vvhich Chriſt requires in vs, for the fitting vs to this labour, vvhich ſtands in the remouing of the lets, &amp; impediments, that hinder vs from labouring for that meat vvhich indures

vnto euerlaſting life. And this is ſet dovvne in theſe vvords, labour not for the meat vvhich periſhes.
            
            Heere vve ſee, that vvhen Chriſt wils vs to labour for heauenly things: he firſt reſtraines vs from the labour for earthly things.
            The reaſon is becauſe, that if the loue, and care of earthly things, be not rooted out of our mindes, the loue, and care of heauenly things can take no place in them: this is manifeſt by that ſpeach of Iohn his 1. Epiſt. 2. cap. 15. verſ. Loue not the vvorld, nor the things of the vvorld, if any man loue the vvorld, the loue of the Father is not in him. It is a moſt certaine truth, that man, vvhoſe heart, &amp; affections is ſet vpon things belonging to his body, muſt be a ſenceles man, concerning the vvellfare of his ſoule. It is expedient therefore,

and alſo neceſſarie, that the care, and ſolicitude of earthly things bee moderated, and borne dovvne in our minds, if euer vve vvill embrace this 
                  •
               abour (commanded by Chriſt) for ſpirituall things, for no man can ſerue 
                  •
               vvo Maſters, it is impoſſible to ſerue God, and the vvorld both, and it is for this cauſe, that Chriſt vvills his Diſciples, Not to care vvhat they ſhould eate, nor vvhat they ſhould drinke, nor vvhat they ſhould put on, put that first they ſhould ſeeke the kingdome of God, and his righteouſnes, vvith a promiſe, that all theſe things ſhall be cast vnto them. And to moue them vnto this, among manie other reaſons, he brings this for one, to vvit, that it is the diſpoſition, and cuſtome of the hea
               
                  •
               hen, and men vvithout God, to ſeek after things concerning this life,

namely, vvhat they ſhould eate, and vvhat they ſhould drinke, and vvhat they ſhould put on, and therefore cōcludes, that they, that knovv God, and profeſſe God to be their Father, ſhould not ſet their hearts vpō theſe Temporall thing: for it is a vvretched, and a miſerable thing, to ſee a Chriſtian mās heart diſpoſed, noe better, then the heart of a prophane heathē, &amp; that his labour, &amp; trauaile, ſhould be employed for no higher end, for no greater, nor better things, then a blind, &amp; ignorant pagan labours for. It muſt needs argue a mind, not truly enlightned as yet, vvith the ſauing knowledge of ſpiritual things, vvhen as it can mind nothing elſe but earthly things. And this is the cauſe vvhy ſo fevv profeſſing Chriſtianitie, doe manifeſt any ſtrong deſires, or carefull ſollicitude. For things eternall▪
               
euen becauſe they lye yet in darkeneſſe, and ignorance of them, Not hauing the eyes of their vnderſtanding opened, to ſee the ſpiritual Ioy, glory, &amp; fellecitie of Gods choſen In Chriſt: for if they did once ſee them, it vvere impoſſible, that they could eſteeme ſo much of earthly, or tranſitory pleaſures, but that their hearts vvould be rauiſhed tovvards heauen, and all things in this vvorld, vvould be as dung in their eyes, for vvhat man is there, vvho getting a ſight of a princely pallace, full of ineſtimable treaſures, and pleaſures, vnto the vvhich he is invited, vvhen hee himſelfe dvvells in a poore, &amp; miſerable cottage, in the mids of a barren wildernes, that vvould not gladlie forſake this poore cottage, &amp; enioy this princely pallace, and yet there is much more difference, betvveene heauen, and

earth, the things of this life, and the things of the life to come, the foode of our bodies, and the foode of our ſoules. VVhat vvretched, and miſerable fooles are theſe, vvhich knovving that Heauen is infinitlie aboue this earth, and that to liue vvith God is vnſpeakeablie better, then any eſtate can be in this life, that ſtill their thoughts ſhould be drovvned in the cares of this life, and neuer lifted vp to thoſe vnſpeakable ioyes, vvhich are at the right hand of God, vvhere Chriſt is. The point then is this, Christ vvill haue vs to knovv, that our hearts must be freed from the cares of this vvorld, before vve can ſet our ſelues to ſeeke things, that are ſpirituall, and heauenly. Euen as a man, if he vvill tranſplant a tree, and ſet it in a better ground, he muſt firſt looſe

it from the earth, vvhere in it groweth: and in vvhich it is rooted, for othervviſe, he may vvell breake it, or deſtroy it, but tranſplant it he cannot: euen ſo mans heart, that is rooted in the things of this life, and naturally ſet vpon them: it is in vaine to thinke, that it can be ſet vpon things, that are aboue, vntill this ſtronge hold it hath on earth be firſt looſed: for no tree is ſo faſt rooted in earth, as mans heart is in earthlie things, and it is a greater difficultie, to plucke the thoughts of mans heart from the care of earthlie things, then to 
                  •
               ayſe the deepeſt tree, that euer vvas in the earth, let men therefore take this vvarning from Ieſus Chriſt, that if they vvill ſeeke the bread of eternall life, they muſt firſt haue their hearts free,

from the careful ſeeking of the bread of this life.
            Novv let vs come to ſpeake of that for vvhich vve ſhould labour. The diſcription vvhereof is ſet dovvne in theſe vvorlds [Labour not for the meat that periſheth: but for that meat vvhich endureth vnto eternal life.] In this deſcription, is ſet dovvn not only that for vvhich vve ſhould labour, but a forcible argument, to moue vs to labour for it: and to diſſuade vs frō labouring for the other this argument is taken from the nature of the meat. For vvhich vve ſhould not labour, and from the nature of that meat, for vvhich vve ſhould labour, vvhich ſhevves then to be in nature contrarie the one to the other, and it ſtands in this, that the one periſheth, and the other endureth: ſo that Chriſts reaſon is after

this manner, labour not for temporal meat, becauſe it periſheth: but labour for ſpirituall meat becauſe it endureth. Let vs novv briefly conſider theſe reaſons. Touching the firſt, it cannot be but a ſore vexation to a mans heart vvhen God giues him eyes to ſee it, that of all hee labours for vnder the ſunne, during all the dayes of his life, ther is nothing of it, that vvill remaine vvith him, but it vvill periſh and decay: but this is one of the greateſt vanities, &amp; argues the moſt miſerable corruption of mans heart vnder the ſunne, that either they cannot, or they vvil not, ſee this, that all things of this vvorld, are periſhing vanities, men naturallie are giuen to think, that both themſelues, &amp; their ſubſtance ſhall endure long, and continue for euer, euen as the 
                  •
               ich glutton, that pulld dovvne his

barnes, and built them bigger, ſaid vnto his ſoule, take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid vp for manie yeares▪ he neither dreamed of dying himſelfe, nor of the decaying of his tranſitorie ſubſtance, &amp; yet poore vvretch it vvas told him, that to morrovv he ſhould dye: if vvee could therefore thinke vpon this, that euerie moment, vvee ſtand in danger, either to be taken from the things of this vvorld, or to haue them taken from vs: it were impoſſible, that we ſhould take ſuch care for vvhat vve ſhould eate, or vvhat vve ſhould drinke, &amp;c. yea if vvee vvould, but marke that vvhich the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the Col. concerning the food of our bodies it vvould be an argument to make vs lay aſide, the ſolicitude, and care for them, ſeing as the Apoſtle ſaith they periſh, euen in the very vſing of thē,

and therfore the ſame Apoſtle in the 1. Cor. 7. vvills them that marry to be as if they married not, and them that poſſeſſed, as if they poſſeſſed not, Becauſe (ſaith hee) the faſhion, or ſhape of this vvorld paſſeth a vvay, and all ſhall once come to an end: &amp; therfore it vvere happy for vs, if vve could know thus much, that vve are but Pilgrims in this vvorld, &amp; therfore muſt vſe all things in it, as Pilgrims vſe their lodgings, that is not ſetling vpon them, nor reſting in them, as though vvee could dvvel heer for euer: for our habitation is prepared for vs in heauen: therefore vvee ſhould paſſe through this earth, as the Pilgrims doe their iourney, vſing all things in this vvorld, as trauellers doe to make them ſerue, to further our iourney to heauen, and not as clogs to hinder vs, ſeing all that is heere vvill periſh.
            
               And yet further to conſider this point, mark, hovv the Apoſtle makes it a ſtrong reaſon, in the 1. Cor. chap. 6. verſ. 13. vvhy men ſhould not eate of any meat vvith offence of their brethren: ſaying, meat is ordained for the belly, and the belly for meat, and God ſhall deſtroy them both, if men had hearts to conſider this, what reaſon could they haue, to be carefull for meat which ſerues to ſatisfie their bellie, vvhen both meat, and bellie, ſhall periſh. It is an ydle dreame for men to thinke, that theſe parts of our bodies, vvhich are only giuen for temporall vſe, in this life. That I ſay vvee ſhall haue any vſe of them in heauen, for there vve ſhall haue no vſe of ſtomacks to diſgeſt, or bovvels to make convayance of our meat, for nouriſhing theſe our bodies, ſeing our bodies in heauen, ſhalbe

immortall, &amp; glorious, like vnto the glorious bodie of the Sonne of God, vvhen therefore vve are feeding our bodies, and ſatisfying our bellies, it is good for vs to thinke, and remember that vve are feeding that, vvhich ſhal periſh: &amp; that with food which ſhall likevviſe periſh, that vve may learne neither to care too much for the bellie, nor for food requiſite vnto it.
            Novv let vs conſider the argument of the contrarie parte, vvherby Chriſt perſwades vs to labour for ſpirituall meat, in vvhich vve are to obſerue tvvo things:
            The firſt is, the nature of this heauenly food in it ſelfe, all though vve neuer do enioy it, vvhich is declared by this [that it endureth.]
            The ſecond, is the effect of it in thē that get it, vvhich is that it makes thē alſo to indure &amp; to liue eternally.
            
               For the firſt, vvee are to conſider, that all the ſpirituall gifts, that God giues vs in Chriſt Ieſus, are all eternall, and ſuch as ſhall neuer periſh: vvhatſoeuer God gaue by creation, it might be defaced, and vtterlie vndone: yea, euen the chiefeſt gift, that euer vvas giuen in nature to Adam, (vvhich vvas Gods Image) vvas by Sathan extinquiſhed, and defaced, and as the Scripture tells vs, at the comming of Chriſt to iudgement, the elements ſhall melt vvith fire, and the earth, and all the vvorks thereof ſhall periſh, and the heauens ſhall vvax ould as a garment, and this vvhole vvorld ſhall come to an end, but the gifts of ſauing grace, giuen vs in Chriſt, can neuer be extinquiſhed, or defaced, for as it is impoſſible to deſtroy the Sonne of God himſelfe, or that the ſorrovves

of death, ſhould haue held him vnder them, or that the graue ſhould haue povver to retaine him, ſo is it impoſſible, that Chriſt giuen vnto vs, and his fleſh vvhich vve eate, and his blood vvhich vve drinke, or the vertue of them in vs, can euer poſſiblie bee defaced in vs, and this is the reaſon that Chriſt ſaith, that his fleſh is meat in deed, and his blood is drinke in deed for his fleſh is not a periſhing meat, nor his blood a decaying drinke, vvhich cannot endure, as the nature of all other meat, and drinke is: but his fleſh is euerlaſting food, and his blood euerlaſting drinke, and his grace as a vvell, ſpringing continuallie, to euerlaſting life, men might thinke, that by the death of our bodies, the vertue of Ieſus Chriſts fleſh, and blood, vvere vtterlie periſhed,

but it is not ſo, they that eate this fleſh, and drinke this blood, ſhall find the vertue of his fleſh, &amp; blood, euen vvhen they are rotten in the graue, &amp; by the ſame povver, vvhere vvith he rayſed himſelfe from the dead, hee ſhall likevviſe rayſe them, from the povver of death, this then is the firſt thing, vvhich vve are to conſider in this food, that it is an enduring meat.
            But the next thing is a greater comfort vnto vs, for this is not all the bleſſednes of this food, and comfort of this argument, to knovv that the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, are in themſelues permanent, and eternall, but that vvhich chiefly refreſheth our ſoules is this, to know that vvhoſoeuer pertakes of them, ſhal pertake of eternall life vvith them, this is a bleſſed thing in deed, vvhen I knovv,

that not only the things vvhereof I am made pertaker are eternall, but that I my ſelfe, by pertaking of them ſhall be eternall as vvell as they. VVhat can moue a man to ſeeke this meat, if this doe it not? vvhen vvee vnderſtand that it hath this povver to vvork ſuch a bleſſed effecte in him that is pertaker of it. It is vndoubtedlie, the miſerable ignorance of (this benefit, vvhich comes by the fleſh, &amp; blood, of Chriſt,) that makes men ſo careles to enioy them, there is nothing in the vvorld, that a man more deſires then to liue for euer, all that euer a man hath he vvill giue for his life, that he may not ſee death, but as Dauid ſaith in the 49. Pſal. No man can by any means redeeme his brother, nor giue to God a ranſome, that he ſhould liue for euer. Indeed it is no temporall thing, that can procure

eternal life, no not all the means that can be diuiſed, eate vvhat a man can eate, &amp; drink vvhat a man can drink, yet he ſhal dye, but heere is the comfort of a Chriſtian, that frō Chriſt, he is fed vvith that meat, that ſhall make him to liue for euer: in ſuch ſorte, that the gates of hel ſhal not preuaile againſt him, neither death nor the graue ſhal haue povver ouer him, but he ſhall haue a glorious triumph ouer them both, ſo as he ſhall ſing that ioyfull ſong, o death, where is thy ſting, o graue, vvhere is the victory? And this is no vvōder, ſeing the cauſes of this life are eternall, it cannot be but that the life that flovveth frō them muſt be eternall, and they that are fed vvith him muſt needs liue eternally, for all that we receaue from Chriſt, is eternal, the peace eternall, the ioy, &amp; life eternall, &amp; this is that vvhervvith Chriſt comforts

his diſciples, Iohn 16.22. ſaying, Your ioy ſhall no man take from you: Thus a child of God in the midſt of all his troubles, &amp; in the midſt of the valley of the ſhadovv of death, vvill feare no euill, but can ſtill reioyce in God his ſauiour. O hovv ſhould this ſtir vp our hearts, to ſeeke after this meat, euē as the vvoman of Samaria, in the 4. of Iohn. the 15. vvhen Chriſt told her of vvater vvhich he had to giue, vvhich vvhoſoeuer did drink of ſhould neuer be more a thirſt, ſhe ſaid, Lord, giue me of that vvater, that I may not thirst any more, nor come hether to draw. Likevviſe the Ievves in this ſame chapter, vvhen Chriſt told them, that the bread of God giues life to the vvorld, they ſaid vnto Chriſt, Lord giue vs euer more of this bread: euen ſo vvhen vve heare, that they that eate the fleſh, and drinke

the blood of Chriſt, ſhall liue eternallie. Should vvee not in our hearts deſire it, and beg of Chriſt to make vs pertakers of it, and earneſtly long to enioy it: ſurely it muſt needs be a moſt luſt thing vvith God to povvre dovvne heauie iudgment vpon this ſenceles age, and ſinfull generation of men, vvho take greater pleaſure to ſeeke after the ſtinking delights of this fleſh, and to vvallovv in their beaſtly luſts, then to enioy this bleſſed bread, that endures to euerlaſting life: for it is impoſſible for any man to haue perpetuitie of being vvithout this, vvhen therefore vvee ſee other men to call their lands by their names, ſo to perpetuate their names on earth: let vs not follovv their fooliſh footſteps, but if vve deſire to liue for euer, let vs labour for this meat, vvhich endures to eternall life, and

thus much for the reaſon, cōtayning alſo a diſcription of that, for vvhich vvee ſhould labour.
            Seeing then vvee ſee vvhat great reaſon, vvee haue to ſeeke this ſpirituall food, it is neceſſarie for vs to knovv vvhere vvee ſhall find it, and that is the next point vve are to conſider, ſet dovvne in theſe vvords, [vvhich the ſonne of man ſhall giue vnto you.] In theſe vvords, let vs marke theſe tvvo things: Firſt vvho it is, of vvhom vvee muſt haue this meat: That is the Sonne of man: The ſecond is, hovv vve ſhall haue it, and that is ſet dovvne in theſe vvords, he ſhall giue it vnto vs.
            Touching the firſt, vvee are to mark, that it pleaſeth Chriſt through out the Scriptures, to name himſelfe more by this name (the Sonne of man) then by any other, eſpeciallie

vvhen he ſpeaks of the vvorks of ſauing grace: and for the comfort of his elect ones: it muſt therefore be a matter of great moment, and of ſingular inſtruction for vs, that moues Chriſt to take this name vpon himſelfe, and certainly it is ſo, although not perceaued, nor comprehended, by euerie man. In this ſame chapter vvhen Chriſt had told the levves, that vnles they did eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, they had no life in them, many of his diſciples murmured at it, and ſaid, this is a hard ſaying, and in deed no maruell, that it ſeeme hard to a naturall man, for hovv can he thinke, that the fleſh, and blood of man, ſhould haue the vertue of eternall life in them, but Chriſt opens this miſtery in the ſame place, telling them that it vvas the ſpirit

that quickeneth, the fleſh proſitteth nothing: for it is true, that all though vvithout this fleſh and blood, vve can haue no life in vs, yet certainly euen the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, nakedly conſidered, as fleſh and blood, or yet, as the fleſh and blood of a man, could neuer giue life to them, that eate and drinke it, but as being the fleſh, and blood of God, in the vvhich fleſh, all the fullnes of the God-head dvvels bodily, it is no maruell that it giues life to them, that eate and drinke them, for as much as the eternal ſpirit is neuer ſeparated from this fleſh, nor from this blood, &amp; therfore all though their can be no eternall life, but frō this eternal ſpirit, yet it is the pleaſure of God, that no ſauing vertue of the Diety, nor life frō the God head ſhould euer be cōmunicated vnto man, but in, &amp; through

the fleſh, and blood of Ieſus Chriſt the Lord: Let no man therefore Diſpiſe this fleſh, &amp; blood, nor the outvvard means, vvhereby our fellovvſhip, and communion, in this fleſh, and blood is ſealed vnto vs, ſince vvithout this fleſh, and blood, it is not the purpoſe of God to ſaue vs, let vs therefore lay vp this miſterie in our hearts, that as the fleſh of Chriſt can neuer quicken, but by the ſpirit, euen ſo alſo the ſpirit ſhall neuer quicken but by the fleſh.
            There is yet more in this to be conſidered, and that is, that as God vvill diſpence no ſauing grace, but in the fleſh, and blood, of Ieſus Chriſt the man, ſo he vvill not diſpence it, but by Chriſt as hee is man, for God hath giuen all iudgment to the Sonne, not as hee is God ſimplie, but as he is the Sonne of man, and by him as hee is

man, vvill he iudge the vvorld, as the Apoſtle ſaith in the 17. of Act. God hath appointed a day, in which he vvill iudge the vvorld in righteouſnes, by the man vvhom he hath ordained. Ieſus Chriſt, as man, ſhall iudge both heauen, and earth. For the Father hath exalted him in his man hood, and hath giuen him a name, aboue all names vnto vvhich all knees must bovve, and euerie mouth confeſſeth him, to be the Lord, therefore it is not vvithout cauſe, that Dauid conſidering this vvondered, as you may ſee in the 8. pſal. ſaying: VVhat is man, that thou art mindfull of him, and the ſonne of man, that thou viſitest him, for thou haſt made him a littel lovver then the Angels, and haſt crowned him vvith honour, and glorie, and hath put all things vnder his feet: It is good for vs to conſider this, that as

Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, all povver is giuen vnto mee, ouer all fleſh, the povver of ruling, and of iudging, of ſauing, &amp; damming men, is giuen to Chriſt as man, for there is nothing, that is not ſubdued vnto Chriſt the man, as the Apoſtle proues in the 1. Cor. 15. from theſe vvords of the Pſalme: that God hath ſubdued all things vnder his feet, prouing therby that it is manifeſt, that nothing is vnſubdued to him, but he that did ſubdue them, vntill that the laſt enemie death it ſelfe be ſubdued, Chriſt ſhall ſtil poſſeſſe the kingdome, but vvhen hee hath ſubdued all things, then ſhall he render vp the kingdome to his father, that God may be all in all: but in the meane time till this be done, all povver is giuen to Chriſt as man, to deſtroy all aduerſarie powers, either diuells or vvicked men, thus

hath God honoured, &amp; highly exalted the humanitie of his Sonne, by 
                  •
               ertue of the fullnes of the God head 
                  •
               vvelling in him bodilie, this is the 
                  •
               eaſon that Chriſt in this place ſaith, the Sonne of man ſhall giue vs this bread of eternall life.
            The conſideration of theſe things,  
                  •
               erue for a ſingular cōfort to the Godly: &amp; a fearefull terror to the vvicked.
            Touching the vvicked, vvhen they muſt ſee, &amp; knovv this, that the man vvhom they haue pearced, and put to 
                  •
               eath, vvhom they haue ſo deſpiſed vvhoſe blood, they haue trod vnder foote, to be exalted to ſuch glorie, and vvhen they ſhal ſee him come in the 
                  •
               louds, in maieſtie, and great povver, accompanied vvith innumerable an
               
                  •
               ells, and hearing (him ſitting in the throne of iudgmēt) prononce the ſentence of eternall death againſt them.
            
               For the Godly it is a matter of ſinguler ioy, to knovv, that he ſhall be their iudge, and that in his humaine nature, vvherin in all things hee vvas made like vnto them, ſinne only excepted, and vvherein he vvrought their redemption by his ovvn death, &amp; vvhen they ſhall vnderſtand, that the diſpenſation of all things is put in his hands, and that he hath povver to giue eternall life, yea he himſelfe to giue his ovvne fleſh, and blood vnto vs, vnto eternall life, certainly if this vvere not, the greateſt comfort of Gods elect vvere taken avvaie, no conſideration of the Sonne of God, as God ſimplie, could poſſibly refreſh our ſoules, if vvee did not conſider him in his fleſh, being man, for he is no leſſe terrible in his Dyetie to a ſinner, then the Father: but our intereſt in him ariſeth vpon this, that

hee is be come our brother in our nature, that being man, hee might bring vs that are men to God. Therefore firſt of all he did a baſe himſelfe, and tooke vpon him the ſhape of a ſeruant, and in that nature hath vvrought our eternall redemption, and did glorifie himſelfe in that ſame fleſh, vvith that glorie, that he had vvith the Father, before the vvorld vvas, all to this end, that he might aduance vs to the ſame dignitie vvith himſelfe: for though as God he had povver ſufficientlie to ſaue vs, yet vve had neuer bene pertakers of it, if he had not prepared the vvay by his fleſh to communicate it vvith man: and if Chriſt himſelfe in our nature, had not taken poſſeſſiō of the glorie, and kingdome of God: it had bene impoſſible for any other man, euer to haue come to the participation of

that glorie or kingdome, and thus much for the firſt point, that is of him, from vvhom we muſt haue this bread.
            Novv, let vs come to the manner hovv vve ſhall get it, and that is ſet dovvne in the ſvvords (he ſhall giue it vnto you) A man might thinke by the former vvords of Chriſt, vvhen he vvills vs to labour for it, that a man himſelfe by labour vvere the purchaſer of it? but it is not ſo, let a man doe vvhat he can, he is ſtill vnvvorthie of it, yet not vvithſtanding Chriſt vvill haue vs to knovv, that the man that ſeeks for it ſhall get it, though neither hee nor his labour be vvorthie of it: Chriſt requires no more of thee but to ſeeke for it, and he vvill freely giue it, thou canſt haue nothing vvherevvith to buy it, and therefore the Lord calls

vpon euery one that thirsts to come, and drinke freely, they may haue it vvithout ſiluer, or vvithout any price: ſeeing they can haue it for the ſeeking only. O hovv iuſtly ſhall theſe vvretches be damned, that vvill take no paines to beg, or ſeeke for it, of all things in the vvorld, this ſhall be one of the chiefeſt that ſhal gnaw the hearts of men moſt miſerablie, vvhen they ſhall ſee themſelues eternallie damned, becauſe they neuer ſought after life in Chriſt, but vvhen they ſhould haue ſought for it, they gaue themſelues to ſeeke their pleaſures, &amp; did loue rather to hunt after a vvhore, and their beaſtly luſts then after Chriſt the Son of God, &amp; Sauiour of the world, mark Chriſts ſpeech Iohn 5. You vvill not come vnto me, ſaith Chriſt, that I might giue you eternall life: he deſires no more of them,

but that they vvill come to him, and he vvill giue them life. Alas! hovv many is there vvho vvhen Chriſt doth call vpon them, and couer his table vnto them, and offer his fleſh that vvas broken for them, and his blood, that vvas ſhed for the remiſſion of their ſinnes, vvho not vvithſtanding vvill not come at all, vnto the bleſſed Table of the Lord: ſhall euer Chriſt thinke theſe men vvorthie of eternall life, that vvhen they may haue the food of it for comming vnto it, doe not vvithſtanding neglect it. If vve did but ſee our miſerie, and our vvretched eſtate in ſinne, vnder Gods vvrath, then vve vvould make great account of that vvee diſpiſe, and our hearts vvould ſmite vs for our contempt of that, vvithout vvhich their is no life to our ſoules, that is the only bread vvhich

brings eternall life to our ſoules. O vvhat vertue, vvhat comfort, vvhat life, and efficacie vnto life, ſhall vvee find in that fleſh, and in that blood, if vve did truly embrace it, &amp; receiue it from Chriſt, certainly many thouſands depriue themſelues of all ioy, and true conſolation in Chriſt, only becauſe they vvill not paine themſelues to ſeeke it. Iames vpbraids men in his time, not only becauſe they aſked amiſſe, but he tells them, they got nothing, becauſe they aſked not, and the ſame Iames ſhevves vs, that if a man doe aſke, he ſhall receaue, when he ſaith, If any man lack wiſdom let him aſke of God, that giues liberally to all, and Chriſt confirmes the ſame in the Goſpel, vvhen he bids vs, aſke, &amp; vve ſhall haue, ſeeke, &amp; vve ſhall find, their damnatiō then muſt needs be iuſt that neuer ſought after Chriſt.
            
               Novv the laſt point, vvhich vve are to knovve, is concerning the ground of all our aſſurance, that vvee ſhall get this bread, vvhich endures vnto eternall life from Chriſt, &amp; that is ſet dovvne in theſe vvords, [For him hath God the Father ſealed.]
            Theſe vvords comprehend a matter of chlefe moment for our conſideration, for if this vvere not, all the knovvledge of Chriſt vvere but ſmall comforte, to a poore ſinfull ſoule, but this it is that giues vs ioy, in the contemplation of Chriſt crucified, that vve knovv, that God the Father hath ſealed him.
            To conſider this place therefore a right, vvee are to knovv, that it is taken from the cuſtome of men, vvho vvhen they vvill haue any thing to be made ſure, and ſted-faſt, and vvhen they vvill make it to

haue authoritie, and ſtrength, they are accuſtomed to adde their ſeale to it, to confirme it, by vvhich vvhatſoeuer is promiſed, is made more ſtronge: ſo God by this ſorte of ſpeech doth ſhevv vs, that not only, he hath giuen Chriſt to be our Sauiour according, as hee declares in his VVord, and that hee is that Lambe of God, that takes avvay the ſinnes of the vvorld, and that hee hath not only reconciled al things, by the blood of his croſſe, but alſo to make all things ſure, and firme, that vvee might neuer call this into queſtion, hee hath ratified all this, by adding his ſeale vnto it.
            Out of this, vve are firſt to learne: That the naked knovvledge, and conſideration of Christ, and vvhat God hath made him vnto vs, is not ſufficient

to ſaluation, except vvee know, that God the Father hath ſealed Christ to be all in all vnto vs, that hee hath promiſed, and vvhich he hath made him to be, vvhereby I may be confirmed, that vvhatſoeuer God ſaith, Chriſt is, or vvhatſoeuer God is ſaid to haue made him for mee, is vndoubtedly ſo, here vve may ſe, that in our minds vve muſt aſcend higher then Chriſt himſelfe, or the promiſe of God in him, to ſeeke the chiefeſt ground, or ſtay of our faith, vvhich allthough it can haue no ground vvithout Chriſt, and vvithout the promiſe, yet neither the promiſe, nor Chriſt (in vvhom the promiſe is yea, and amen) could be any ſure ground of life, &amp; ſaluation to me vnleſſe both came from this, and vvere ſtamped vvith this ſeale of the Father in Chriſt, for all though, that Chriſts

fleſh be ſaid to giue life to thoſe, that are pertakers of it: yet the ground, and reaſon of this ſtands in this, that the Father hath ſealed him in his fleſh to be the life of the vvorld, ſo that vvithout knovvledge of this, our hope and faith vvere vaine.
            Let vs therefore come to conſider this ſeale of God. Firſt in generall, vve knovv that a ſeale vvhen it is applied doth leaue the impreſſion of it ſelfe, moſt liuely in the vvax vvhere into it is ſet, ſo that all the forme, the ſhape, and marks, that are in the ſeale are liuely imprinted in the vvax, thus hath God the Father dealt vvith his Sonne, for there is no promiſe of mercy, of grace, of holines of life, or glorie, vvhich God hath made in Chriſt to ſinners, but he hath ſtamped the ſame in Chriſt the man, ſo that euerie man that ſees the fleſh of

Chriſt, vvith true ſpirituall eies, may ſe that his fleſh, is ſtampt vvith righteouſnes, vvith the life of God, and vvith immortall peace, &amp; euerlaſting glory. But to come nearer to the conſideration of this ſeale, it is true, that many men run to his Diety, to find this ſeale, and that becauſe it is ſaid in the firſt of the Hebrewes concerning Chriſt, that hee is the brightnes of the glorie, and the expreſſe, or in grauen image of the Fathers perſon, for vvhich cauſe it is ſaid, that he that ſees the Sonne, ſees alſo the Father: but not vvithſtanding all this, if the Sonne of God had bene ſealed by the Father, only in his diuine nature, as he is the ſecond perſon of the trinitie, &amp; that this ſeale of God had neuer reached from his God head, to his humanity, his fleſh could neuer haue bene the bread of life, therfore we muſt labour

to ſee this ſeale of God, ingrauen in Chriſt the man, elſe hovv can vvee knovv, that by eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood, vve haue eternall life, ſince vvith out this ſeale, his fleſh, and blood could haue no more force, to giue life, then any other fleſh, or blood, of any other man: therfore let vs conſider, vvherin this ſealing of the Son, as he is man cōſiſts.
            This ſeale hath fiue ſpeciall things in it, to be conſidered.
            The firſt is Gods eternall ordinatiō, &amp; appointmēt, wherby he did ordaine Chriſt the man, and none but Chriſt the man, to be the food of our ſoules, to be the mediator betvveene God, &amp; vs, &amp; ſo to be the only King, Prieſt &amp; Prophet, of Gods houſe for euer, by vertue of this appointment of God, Chriſt comes to bee, that to vs, that hee is, and this eternall decree

of God, concerning Chriſt in his fleſh, to bee our redeemer, is made manifeſt in the Scripture, vvhen it is told vs, that God ordained him before the vvorld vvas, in the 1. of Peter the 1. chap. and againe vvhere it is ſaid, that there is not a name giuen vnder heauen, by vvhich a man can be ſaued, but the name of Ieſus only, and this is ratified in the Scripture, by the teſtimonie, both of God himſelfe, and Iohn Baptiſt, and of the Apoſtle. The Father from heauen did vvitnes ſo much, vvhen as he ſaid, this is my vvell beloued Sonne, in vvhom I am vvell pleaſed, there by declaring, that in Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne, (novv made man) his vvrath tovvards vs, vvas taken avvay: and he vvell pleaſed vvith vs, not vvithſtanding our manifold ſinnes, committed againſt him, and all thoſe ſpeeches of God,

vvhereby God ratifies, that Chriſt the man, is his Sonne, ſaying, thou art my Sonne, this day haue I be gotten thee, &amp; vvhere by he confirmes him, to be our euerlaſting Prieſt, for euer, after the order of Melchiſedeke, and vvhereby hee vvitneſſes him to be made Lord of his church, ſaying, the Lord ſaid to my Lord, ſit at my right hand, till I make thine ennemies thy footſtoole, all theſe do make manifeſt the truth of this point, that it is Chriſt the man, vvhom God hath decreed to be, both the Author, and matter of our ſaluation. And this is the firſt part of this ſeale of God, this knovvledge, that God hath ordained him only, and none but him, to be the bread of life.
            The ſecond part of Gods ſeale, vvhere by he hath ſealed Chriſt the man, appeares in the vvorks of Gods

ovvne power, which the Father gaue him to doe, as in raiſing the dead, commanding of the ſeas, and tempeſts, the reſtoring ſight to the blind, curing of all diſeaſes, yea, and commanding the very diuels, &amp;c. therefore it is that Chriſt ſaith in the 5. of Iohn verſ. 6. after this manner, The vvorkes vvhich the Father hath giuen me to finiſh, the ſame vvorkes that I doe beare vvitnes, that the Father ſent me, &amp; the Father himſelfe, vvhich hath ſent mee beares vvitnes of mee, and againe in the 10. of Iohn verſ. 25 If I doe not the workes of my Father beleeue me not: But if I doe them, though you beleeue not me, yet beleeue the vvorkes, that you may knovv, that the Father is in me, and I in him, verſ. 37.38. Theſe vvorkes vvhich none could doe but God him ſelfe, being done by Chriſt the man, are the ſecond part of Gods ſeale,

vvhereby God the Father doth let vs ſee, that this man Ieſus, is hee alone of vvhom vvee all muſt looke for life.
            The third parte of this ſeale conſiſts in this, that God the Father hath laid vpon Chriſt the man, the chaſtiſments of our peace, that by his ſtripes vvee might be healed, for by inflicting vpon him in his fleſh, all the puniſhments, and vvrath of God, vvhich vvee by our iniquities haue deſerued, hee thereby ſealed his manhood to be the food of life, making him as a Lambe roaſted vvith fire for our food▪ And for this cauſe, it is ſaid of Chriſt (Hebr. the 5. and the 9,) That he being conſecrated, vvas made the Author of eternall ſaluation vnto all them, that obay him: for vvhen God did take vengeance vpon Chriſt his Sonne for our iniquities,

he made him ſinne for vs, that vvee might be made the righteouſnes of God in him: and by his croſſe, killed hatred, and brought in euerlaſting peace, therefore in as much as it is hee alone, that hath vndergone the curſe of the lavve, and the vvrath of God for vs that are ſinners: it is manifeſt, that God giues none to be the bread of life to our ſoules, but him alone, and this is the reaſon, vvhy the Apoſtle to correct that great ſchiſme, in the church of Corinth: vvhen one ſaid he vvas Pauls, another Apollos, &amp;c. and to force them all, to acknovvledge none but Chriſt for their Sauiour, he vſes this forme of argument, vvas Paul crucified for you? &amp;c. as if he vvould ſay none but he vvho is crucified for you, are you to depend vpon for life, and ſaluation: and the ſame is the reaſon, vvhy the ſame

Apoſtle vvritting to the Corinth: the firſt Epiſt▪ chapt. 2. ſaith, that he did determinate to know nothing among them but Ieſus Christ, and him crucified, and againe he ſaith in the 6. of Gal verſ 14. God for bid, that I ſhould reioyce, but in the croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Christ.
            
            The fourth part of this ſeale ſtandeth in this, that God the Father hath raiſed Chriſt Ieſus his ſonne from the dead, and hath taken him out of the povver of the graue, and hath ſet him at his right hand in heauen, and crovvned him vvith glorie, and honour, making him the head of men, and Angels giuing him all povver in heauen, and in earth, and aboue all, giuing him to be the head of his church, thus ſetting him in that fleſh, vvherein he vvrought our redemption, and ſuffered the chaſticement

of our peace, in the full poſſeſſion of the kingdome, life, and glorie, vvhich hee hath purchaſed vnto vs, filling him in that his man-hood, vvithall fullnes of grace, and glorie, that out of his fullnes, vvee might dravv grace, ſo fitting this his fleſh thus glorified, to be the effectuall means of communicating life, and glorie vnto vs in our fleſh, and for this cauſe it is, that the Apoſtle doth proue, that God ſhall iudge the vvorld by Chriſt the man, by this argument, to vvit, becauſe God had raiſed him vp from the dead, Acts. 17.31. and the Apoſtle: for this cauſe, makes this the chiefe point of the knovvledge of Ieſus Chriſt, to vvit, that vve haue ſuch a high Prieſt, that ſitteth at the right hand of the throne of the maieſtie, in heauen: Hebrevves the 8. and the 1.

for allthough hee had beene man, and in mans nature had ſuffered all puniſhments due to vs, for our iniquities, yet not vvithſtanding if he had neuer beene raiſed from the dead, and triumphed ouer the graue, vvee could neuer haue hoped, to haue attained to eternall life by his fleſh, for if that fleſh of his, had beene ouercome by death, vve could neuer haue ouercome death, in our fleſh, therefore it is, that the Apoſtle builds our hope of life, vpon the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead: 1. Pet. chapt. 1. verſ. 3. ſaying, Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Ieſus Christ, vvho according to his aboundant mercie, hath be gotten vs againe to the hope of life, by the reſurrection of Ieſus Christ from the dead: And againe in

the ſame chapter verſ. the 21. he ſaith thus, that God raiſed him from the dead, and gaue him glorie, that our faith, and hope might be in God, and this is the fourth part of this ſeale.
            The 5. and laſt part of this ſeale, vvhich is the ground, and foundation of the reſt, is this: That this man in his fleſh is not only by Gods eternall decree appointed, and by the Fathers voyce from heauen ratified, to be the only redeemer, and life of the vvorld, and confirmed to be this, by his vvorks, his ſuffrings, and his glorious exaltation, at the right hand of God, but chiefly, and principally, becauſe in this his manhood, thus abaſed, and againe exalted, doth dvvell all the fullnes of the God head bodily, Coloſ. the verſ 2.9. for if this vvere not, all the former part of this ſeale vvere not ſufficient to make his fleſh the bread of life, for immortall

life cannot come to vs, but from that fleſh, vvhich hath immortall life in it ſelfe, and this is the reaſon that Chriſt vſes that ſpeach, in the 6. of Iohn, vvhen he vvould proue, that he that eats his fleſh, and drinks his blood hath euerlaſting life, ſaying, as that liuing Father hath ſent me, and I liue by the Father, euen ſo hee that eats my fleſh, euen he ſhall liue by me, in the 57. verſ. this therefore is the greateſt parte, of this ſeale vvherevvith God the Father hath ſealed Chriſt the man: to vvit that he hath ſtamped the fleſh of Chriſt vvith the Diety it ſelfe, and ſo conſequently vvith life it ſelfe: it is no vvonder therefore, that this fleſh, and this blood do giue life to thoſe, that eate and drinke it, ſeeing it is the fleſh. and blood of God himſelfe, therfore it is ſaid in the 20. of Acts. verſ. 28.

               that God hath purchaſed his church by his owne blood: no man therefore that is not a moſt vvretched infidell can deny, that this fleſh and blood of Chriſt, is able to giue eternall life to him that doth receaue it, and this point is carefully to be marked of vs, becauſe the Apoſtle in the 1. Corint. the 11. chapt. ſhevving the reaſon why the Corinths in eating the Lords ſupper, did eate vnvvorthily, yea did eate iudgment vnto themſelues, doth plainely ſhevv vs that it conſiſted in this, that they did not diſcerne the Lords body, verſ. the 29. for the banquet of the Lords ſupper, is not a bāquet of the fleſh of a meere man: but it is of the fleſh and blood, of the euerlaſting King, and Lord, of heauen and earth, euen of the eternall God himſelfe, and therefore no maruell, that all thoſe, vvho eating

it, &amp; not diſcerning it ſo, are counted guiltie of the body and blood of the Lord. VVee ſee then, vvhat comfort vvee haue in the conſideration of this point, to vvit, that God the Father hath ſealed Chriſt the man, to be the bread of eternall life, to all that eate his fleſh, giuing vs full aſſurance heere by in all the teſtimonies, vvhich he hath giuen of him, and all the vvorks vvhich hee hath vvrought by him, and all that hee hath effected in his humanity, and in that he hath made his humanity, the euerlaſting tabernacle of the Godhead, that novv vvee need no more doubte, but that hee it is, vvho not only is vvilling, but alſo able to giue vs that food, that endures to eternall life. therfore let vs come with bouldnes, and chearefullnes, and labour to

be pertakers of this fleſh and blood of the Sonne of God, vvhich if vve receaue as vve ought, vve may be ſure our ſoules ſhall neuer periſh.
            FINIS.
