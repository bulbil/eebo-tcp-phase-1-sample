            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               I haue conſidered my vvayes, and turned my feete into thy teſtimonies.
               I made haſt and prolonged not to keepe thy commandements.

            To the Right Honorable, his verie ſingular good Lorde and Maiſter, Henrie Earle of Penbrooke, Lorde Harbert of Cardiffe, Marmion, and S. Quintine, and of the moſt honorable order of the Garter Knight. G. B. wiſheth increaſe of all mercie and comfort in Chriſt Jeſus for euer.
            
               THe Lorde knoweth, who ſearcheth my heart and reines (right Honorable and my verie ſingular good Lord) that being placed in the Vniuerſitie with ſo great

content both for profit, pleaſure, and the exerciſe of my miniſterie in ſuch place, as it pleaſed God moſt mercifully to bleſſe it in, to my great comfort, I had litle deſire to make change of that eſtate ſo accompanied both with theſe and manie other ſpeciall commodities, til it pleaſed him that hath his times and oportunities for all men, to direct me to your Lo. in ſuch ſort as he did, and there firſt of your ſelfe, and afterward of my ho. good Ladie to make mee heare ſo carefull, ſo Chriſtian, and ſo zealous a regarde both of your ſelues, and your whole

retinue to be directed in the courſe that became the profeſſors of the Goſpell, and the inioyers of theſe happie daies vnder ſo famous and renouned a gouernement of ſo worthy, bleſſed, and gracious a Princeſſe. And thē I muſt needs confeſſe I felt a forcing reſolution after I had a while ſtriuen with the loſſe of theſe forenamed benefites, with the farre ſeparation of my ſelfe from all my friendes, and with the diſcomforts incident nowe &amp; then euen to the beſt ſeruices. So was it (my good Lorde) your zeale and affection to your God, that then firſt perſwaded

me. And truely euen the ſelfe ſame thing it was, that euer after retained me, more vnable than many, but as willing as euer was any to the vttermoſt both of power and life to doe your Lo. ſeruice. The verie ſelfe ſame thing it is alſo out of all queſtion, that ſhall euer, aboue any worldly commoditie that may be offered them, procure vnto your Lo. both in one place and other, thoſe that loue vertue and vpright dealing. For verie well with themſelues will they euer imagine (as indeede it ſhould be) that where the Lord is feared and honored as he ought

to bee, there faithfull ſeruice will both be regarded, &amp; conueniently rewarded, there mē ſhall bee iudged according to proofe, and not according to pratles there heat of affections ſhall not ſtirre to ſouden &amp; vndeſerued diſpleaſure, but conſcience to giue euerie man his due triall, ſhall finde out the innocencie of the true dealer. And what ſhould I ſay? There they will aſſure themſelues, euerie man ſhall bee vſed with conuenient incoragement, credit, &amp; comfort, if his dealings doe deſerue the ſame, beſide many moe verie ſpeciall vertues of a maiſter fearing God.

VVherefore if I ſhould wiſhe vnto your Lo. in a thouſande tearmes many ſeueral and ſingular bleſſings, and afterward include them all in one, truely it muſt be this, that you may euer know the God of your father, and ſerue him with a perfect heart and a willing minde: Knowe him I ſay, by learning what he willeth, and ſerue him, by daily practiſing, as hee inableth, of that will. For thus to the Lorde you ſhall become obedient, to your Prince faithfull, for your countrey carefull, to your ſeruauntes, that breake both body and braines in your affaires, and beare the

brunt of many an vnknowen toyle and hazarde, comfortable and beneficiall, to thouſandes that liue vnder you, honorable and good, and to euerie man (in a worde) ſo affected and diſpoſed, as they that are alreadie in all dutifull right your owne, may ſo remaine: and they that are not, by ſo cheerefull vſage and honorable vertue may daily be added and wonne vnto you. VVherefore (my good Lorde) with all chriſtian care continue your happie courſe in the waies of the Lorde, and what Salomon ſaith, remember often: Heare counſell and receiue inſtruction

(meaning from the Lorde) for they ſhall make a man wiſe in time. Yea they ſhall ſo eſtabliſh a man in the eyes of the Lorde, as that his ſeede ſhall inherite the earth, &amp; his name neuer be blotted out. Cōtinue alſo that Chriſtiā care to other the deſolat flocks of the Lords people, that with ſo great and iuſt praiſe your Honour hath ſhewed of late ſo many waies. And amongeſt all, or rather euen aboue them all (as manie ſpecial cauſes bind me to wiſh) I moſt humbly and hartily beg the ſame to your towne of Cardiffe, vnable peraduenture in manie thinges, but vnwilling

I hope in nothing, to deſerue both fauour and furtheraunce in al cauſes tēding vnto good. Amongeſt whome your Lor. in zeale to their good hath left mee, and to whome for your L. ſake I vow my ſelfe if I may doe them good. Yet not more to thē, than to the whole countrie, and euen the verie meaneſt member therein, they being all in generall ſo deere vnto your Lo. as manie priuate ſpeaches haue declared. what my power inableth mee vnto, both for duetie vnto your H. and affectiō to themſelues, I truſt they ſhall euer finde in mee, and as faithfull an heart

withall as euer had ſtraunger amongſt them. And if your L. ſhal vouchſafe thereunto your Ho. and louing aſsiſtaunce in their worldlie cauſes whē they haue neede, then may they ſay their affections are thriſe well beſtowed vpon your Ho. and their ſeruice due ten thouſand times, if it were more. Preſentlie I haue indeuored, both for them and others, to lay downe a briefe collectiō of ſuch things concerning the commaundements of God, as in larger maner both before your Lo. and them were handled. And I preſume to offer the ſame to your L. both for my priuate duetie,

beeing bounde, if euer was anie, to bee thankefull, and that alſo it comming vnto them vnder the ſhadowe and ſhield of your Lo. protection, whome they ſo reuerence and honor, may be the more welcome &amp; the better accepted of. For the Chriſtian reader els where, that ſhall weigh my drift, and conſider the place whereunto eſpeciallie I intende it, I aſſure my heart of his godlie and louing acceptance, notwithſtanding the matter hath bin handled by more able inſtrumentes by much, becauſe it is not in the ſame manner, &amp; the Lord may bee glorified in all mens

gifts. Onely therefore of your Lo. I now moſt humbly begge, that with wonted fauour this ſmall trauell may be accepted, and that vnder your Lo. name I may leaue it to the world, as a ſpeaking witneſſe (when I am dead,) of my thankefull heart for all your Honorable goodneſſe to me, which hath beene ſuch, as I wiſh may incourage vpon my ſpeach any that euer ſhall bee thereunto requeſted to ſucceede him in his place, who nowe inioyeth it. So the Lorde of power and mercie multiplie his ſpirite vpon your Lo. with all the bleſſed fruites of the ſame, and graunt you euer

that grace, that hath promiſe both of this life, and that which is to come, Amen. From London this 1. of December.

            To the Right worſhipfull Sir Edwarde Manxell, Sir Edward Stradling, Sir William Harbert knights, &amp; to M. William Mathew, and M. Tho. Lewis Eſquiers; with all other Gentlemen in Glamorgan ſhire that feare God: G.B. wiſheth increaſe of the ſame to the benefit of the Church, and their owne euerlaſting comfort.
            
               SO often as I conſider (Right worſhipfull) our happie daies vnder the bleſſed gouernement of a moſt gracious Princeſſe, &amp; howe we are become euen a wonder as it were &amp; an aſtoniſhment vnto many Nations, for the mercies that we enioy by her meanes: ſo often me thinke euen with melting hearts in a ſweete conceite, we ſhould caſt our ſelues downe before the Lorde, and make a double vow vnto him. Firſt yt we wil with perfect hearts and moſt willing mindes knowe and ſerue ſuch a gracious

God, as amidſt ſo manie dangerous deuiſes of intended ouerthrowe to her perſon, ſo mightily preſerued her Maieſtie, and ſo mercifully hath at this daie ſet her ouer vs, dailie ſtill dealing both with her and vs according to his olde louing kindeneſſe and mercie, keeping her to vs in deſpite of all the caytifes on the earth. Secondly that with hand and with heart, with bodie and bowels, and with eſtate, whatſoeuer the Lorde ſhall giue vs within or without vs, wee wil honor and obey, pray for, &amp; preſerue to our powers amongſt vs, ſo famous &amp; renouned, yea ſo woonderfull an inſtrument of all comfort and good vnto vs, in reſpect of other Princes of the earth. But O the ſinne of our ſoules, and the ſtaines of our thankeleſſe heartes in both theſe duties ſo due ten thouſande times of vs For whome we ſhould knowe, we neglect to knowe, as his mercies binde vs, our mightie GOD and heauenlie father. And whome we ſhould thus obey and honour, pray for, and praiſe God for day and night, with verie weeping and woe, that we can be no more thankefull

vnto her, and for her our nurcing mother, and moſt gracious Queene, her we diſobey in holes and in corners, (to ſay no worſe) and dead without feeling, not conſidering the bleſſing of her, we prouoke both our God, and her gracious heart to diſpleaſure with vs. What proofe this latter hath, and what vnwiſhed matter to furniſh out a larger complaynt, I ſpare to ſpeake, I rewe to thinke it, there are witneſſes moe, than I woulde there were, that knowe it. Thoſe thinges which more beſeeme my penne and paper, I preſume vnto your worſhippes to folowe a litle further, and firſt the neglect that aboundeth euerie where to furniſhe the roomes alotted thereunto with ſufficient men both for giftes and goodwill to diſcharge the duties of true miniſters. A thing euer commanded, a thing euer needefull, &amp; a thing in theſe daies of ours euen aboue all daies required, both in thankefulnes to the Lorde, and in care to haue her Highneſſe obeyed, which ariſeth with religion, and ſo both Gods mercie and her Maieſtie ſtill to

remaine among vs. For him that ſerueth vs, and thus dealeth with vs from day to day, doth not verie ſenſe inſtruct vs, we muſt ſerue againe, if we will inioy him? And is this to ſerue him, to retaine vnto ourſelues the wages, that hee hath prouided for ſufficient men, and to thruſt into his cloth we care not whom? To furniſh his harueſt with idle loiterers, and neuer to looke after, no, nor accept beeing offered, moſt painefull laborers? No, no, he knoweth it, that muſt iudge it, it is not. Yea men themſelues knowe it, if the Lorde would giue feeling, and ſtrength to defie that ſpirite of hauing, that crieth within and ſaieth, reſerue it to thy ſelfe. Yet leaſt anie ſhould pretende the contrarie, where I wiſh them well reſolued of this point, may it be lawefull for mee, with your louing leaues ſomething to lay downe in this behalfe, that I would wiſhe him to conſider, who is not perſwaded of this dutie, if I were to ſpeake with ſuch an one? Firſt then I would haue him viewe the worde of God that ſhall ſtande and iudge vs

all, when heauen and earth ſhall periſh. Than the which woorde nothing can be more contrarie to this ſinne, if either wee reſpect the time of the lawe, or of the Goſpell. For in them both this is euer deliuered, and euer bet vpon, that the people of God ſhould be taught, and men choſen out in abilitie ſuch, as the people might require the lawe at their mouthes, though the meaſure and manner were diuerſe as it pleaſed God to giue his giftes vnto them. Which thing euer drewe with it then, and at this day ſtill truely doth inferre, a godly regarde, and euen a neceſſarie conſcience, when anie place is voide, by the lawes wee liue vnder, alotted to that vſe, to furniſh it as ſufficientlie as wee poſſiblie can and may for that vſe. Otherwiſe by vs it commeth to paſſe that the people are not taught. Nowe this offence groweth either by negligence, or by couetouſneſſe. By negligence when (not weighing or feeling the ſinne of it) we are drawen by affection, or kindred, or other mens ſutes, to beſtowe ſufficient

places vpon inſufficient perſons. By couetouſneſſe, when to reſerue a portion to our ſelues, we doe the like. Both which are greuous offences both againſt God and our countrey, and in the word very plainely condemned. If the firſt be the cauſe, then craue I moſt heartily the conſideration of theſe, and the like concluſions. The Lorde threatneth to the watchman death that warneth not his people, and ſaith he will haue their bloud at his hande,
               Ezek. 3. becauſe hee did not crie. Nowe by me hath beene put in ſuch an one verie careleſly and negligently for affection or ſuch like, yt though he would yet for want of ability can not cry, and alas how then can I want my portion in ye wrath of the Lorde that is threatned againſt all ſuch default? Secondly it is loue in the miniſter to his God, to feede his ſheepe.
               Iohn. 21.15. So is it aſſuredly in the patrone to cauſe them to bee fed. Contrariwiſe it is want of loue in the miniſter,Tit. 2. if he do not feede, &amp; is it not aſmuch in the patrone, if by his default it come to paſſe? Thirdly it is a great fault we think to giue the calling to an vnworthie one, and is it

no fault to giue the liuing to ſuch an one? Thus then we ſee howe the word quickneth our conſciences in this behalfe if we be not dead. And a number mo reaſons might yet be brought, if I ſhould make a treatiſe in a preface. Only this one mo I muſt needes remember which me thinke ſhould awake anie man aliue in this matter. In ye ſixt of Marke it is ſaid of Chriſt, that going out and ſeeing a great multitude of people gathered together,
               Mark. 6. 
               he had compaſſion on them, becauſe they were like ſheepe without a ſheephearde, and hee went out and taught them many thinges. And in the Greeke it is more vehement, expreſſing as it were an aking of his heart, as we call it, or a yearning of his bowels, to ſee ſo pitifull a ſight, as ſo manie people without a teacher. Vpon which notable place I haue vſed in my ſelfe to make two concluſions. Firſt a comfort, then a feare. My comfort is this, that he which mourneth to ſee his people want the benefite of his worde, will giue his people his woorde if they ſeeke it and wiſh it, and where he hath vouchſafed it alreadie, there continue it,

bleſſe it, and giue it power if we pray. For otherwiſe howe ſhoulde it paine him to ſee it wanting? My feare is this, that if his heart ake to ſee his ſheepe depriued of a ſhephearde, hee will aſſuredly bee reuenged euen in great wrath of them that are the cauſers of it. And for Chriſt his ſake let it bee conſidered. For as wee liue, wee may not alwaies looke to laugh, if we make our God to mourne. Thus then if negligence be the cauſe that a countrey is not furniſhed with ſome able miniſters, me thinke we may awake our heartes by the worde of the Lorde, and weying it well, receiue from him ſome better feeling in ſo great a matter. But if couetouſneſſe be the cauſe, and we greatly giuen to ſequeſter that benefit to our ſelues, ſauing onely ſome portion to one to beare the name, then marke we againe the witneſſe alſo of the ſame ſcriptures againſt vs euen in this. And to ſaue mine owne labour, my iudgement being young, heare I beſeeche you the proofes and reaſons againſt this ſinne, by a godly and graue Diuine intreating

of this matter, laide downe vnto my 
                  •
               ands. Firſt he alleadgeth againſt it yt de
               
                  •
               criptiō of a wicked Prince in ye booke of Samuel, amōgſt whoſe euils this is named one,1. Sam. 8.15. that he will take the tythes and giue 
                     •
                  hem to his ſeruantes. Concluding thereon that if the king might not take the tythes to himſelfe, becauſe then they were due to the prieſtes by Gods owne order and commandement for the mainteinance of his ſeruice: ſurelie no priuate man nowe may doe it, ſo long as by authoritie the ſame are eſtabliſhed for the miniſters mainteynance and ſupport. Secondlie if in the law he was accurſed that remoued the mereſtone of the field,
               Deut. 27.17. becauſe hee did wrong in ſucceſſion to diuers: ten thouſande times more is the remoouing of the miniſters liuing ſubiect to the Lords wrath, becauſe both preſently, &amp; ſucceſſiuelie it is hurtfull to a number moe, and in a greater matter. Thirdlie by the Prophete Malachie the Lorde complayneth in expreſſe tearmes,Mala. 3.8. that the taking away of the tythes and offerings from that ende, that they were appointed vnto, was a robbing and ſpoiling of him,
               
yea euen ſuch a ſpoyling, as he woulde viſite with a great and greeuous curſe.

being names of fidelitie, gouernement and carefull preſeruation of the Church. For the worde Patronatus doth not ſignifie Dominium in Eccleſia, but as one noteth very wel, ſeruitii ſollicitudinē. It is alſo called Gratia, quòd ex gratia vel gratis conferri debeant beneficia: alſo aduocatia, becauſe they ſhoulde defend and tender the eſtate of the Churches where of they be Patrons, as aduocates doe the cauſes of their clientes, and ſo for the other names mentioned euen nowe before. And hereupon the lawe giueth them all due and poſſible reuerence euen as maſters from their ſeruauntes, and Fathers from their children. It giueth them preheminence both in the Church and abroad, in ſitting, ſtanding, going and ſuch like. It is prouided likewiſe that if theſe patrons or their children fall into decay,By right of patronage ariſeth to the patron Honos Onus, and vtilitas, write the Canoniſts. What vtilitie, you ſ

                  . they ſhal bee moderately maintained at the diſcretion of the Ordinarie by the Church goods, whereof they are patrons: and this is the onely profite they are to take of the Church. They may lay no ſeruice nor bondage vppon the Church. Tenetur etiam patronus protegere

ecccleſiam, &amp; reparare, ſi minitetur ruinam, &amp; de bono ſacerdote prouidere: that is, the patrone alſo is bounde to protect the Church, and to repaire it, if it be like to fall to ruine, and carefully to prouide a good miniſter. Marke it. Nam tus patronatus, &amp;c. For the patronage ſaith the law is ſuſpended, if the patron preſent an vnworthie one, yea his right, for euer by that law, as ſome thinke, paſſeth to the Biſhop, and hee ſhall neuer preſent more: but if not ſo, yet at the leſt hee ſhall bee depriued of that turne if hee preſent an vnfit man, euen by the lawe in this lande in force. Furthermore in theſe lawes there are ſo manie notable rules and as it were axioms or principles touching the duetie of patrons, as might with great profit and pleaſure be noted, if I had not already too much paſſed the bondes of a preface in a deſire to preuaile ſomething with ſome in this matter. As Patronus non poteſt preſentare ſeipſum. A patron cannot preſent himſelfe, as God knoweth now manie doe in effect. Againe debet preſentare gratis, alias eſt Simonia. Hee muſt preſent freely,

or elſe it is Simonie, and no excommunicate perſon or Simoniſt ſhall bee a patron to preſent. Patronus non eſt vere Dominus Eccleſiae &amp;c. The Patron is not the Lorde of the Church, but as it were an aduocate and defender, neither may hee adminiſter the goods of the Church. Ius patronatus nullum ius proprietatis patrono tribuit. The right of patronage giueth no proprietie to the patron. A notable ſaying. Againe patronus facere poteſt &amp; debet, &amp;c. the patron both may and ought to take heede that the fruites of the Church doe not goe to anie other vſe. Alſo that permiſſion of the Ordinarie by this lawe to take any oath if hee will of euerie incumbent for his cleere entrance, if there were nothing elſe in the worlde againſt it, doeth ſtrike a blowe to the ſoules of them that ſo offende, and that a great one.

                What ſhoulde I note that which yet is moſt worthie noting in this lawe, to wit, that 
                  Ʋenditio iuriſpatronatus prohibita est, niſi vniuerſitas quaedam praediorum, cui hoc ius accedat, diſtrahatur. That is, that the right of patronage may neither bee

bought nor ſoulde, nor paſſe in ſpeciall wordes in anie alienation, but in generall onelie with the lande whereunto it is appertayning. For the ſaide lawe admitteth no patronage in groſſe. Or thoſe expreſſe wordes againe, donatio &amp; permutatio permittitur, not venditio I warrant you. What ſhould I note the moſt exact ſtreytneſſe of theſe laws in making the verie minde of the patron coueting rewarde for the gift of his Church a Simonie before God which they call mentalem Simoniam? With a number ſuch like notable rules and places. So that wee ſee euen theſe lawes alſo deteſt it, and condemne it. And nowe then to conclude this matter, if I thinke there is a God, and a day of iudgement to come for mee, and all my doings, what ſhould my heart miniſter to maintaine mee in this euill, when God and man be againſt it? But why ſhoulde I bee thus tedious in this matter? Truelie that it might appeare, if God ſo will, how farre the corruptions wherein ſome ſleepe as in no offences, differ from the lawes of God and man, and from ſynceritie of former

times and ages. But againe, why vnto you, (right worſhipful) ſhould I write ſo much? Truly that by your godly care, conſcience, &amp; indeuor (hauing the places that you haue) this great wound of your countrey may by litle and litle be releeued, and better prouiſion dayly made for the winning of that good, that bringeth with it ten thouſand bleſſinges promiſed by the Lorde. Which care and chriſtian conſideration (as places fall) I moſt hartily craue in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, vnto whoſe ſeruice I am called, both for his glorie, your owne diſcharge, and the benefit of that place which I wiſh may euer be as the bleſſed of the Lord. I can not be thought to pleade any benefit for my ſelfe, becauſe I want the tongue, and therefore I am more boulde. But nowe I ceaſe to followe it anie further. The ſecond thing that I greatly rewe our want in, is the carefull &amp; good bringing vp of children in learning and vertue whileſt they are fit. Which howe it wanteth for want of ſchooles amongeſt vs, woulde God I ſawe no more, than I had abilitie (without charge to anie) to redreſſe. But

what wanteth in me, aboundeth in you, and might it pleaſe the Lorde, to giue will to your abilitie, in this alſo to promote his glorie, &amp; to benefit thouſands in your countrey, truely his heart hath mercie to accept it kindly, and his hand hath bleſſinges to rewarde it richly. Other thinges alſo yet mo there be, which theſe happie daies of peace would haue vs carefull of. But ſome other times ſhal ſerue to name them, and increaſe of grace ſtirre vp to do them. For this time therfore I leaue off to trouble your worſhips any further, beſeeching you moſt humbly and heartily to conſider the mercies of the Lord which we all inioy, by his worde, by her Maieſtie, by moſt happie helpes about her, by freedome of our conſciences, by plentie &amp; peace, by health and great comfort a thouſand waies, and in thankfulneſſe for them all, to vouchſafe your aſſiſting heartes and handes to theſe duties euer, that may long prouoke the Lorde our God to be thus good and gracious to vs. Of which number are theſe that I nowe haue named, the preaching of his worde, and

God hauing dealt thus mercifully with me in my miniſterie, and by the hande of this author thus holpen me; I thought my ſelfe in duetie bound, in reſpect of this courſe which God hath taken with me, (and eſpecially by his meanes) to giue to thee ſome teſtimonie of this his worke, for thy further profit, &amp; withall to him ſome witneſſe of my good will. Suppoſing my ſelfe in reſpect of the former cauſe, as fitte to doe

this as another, &amp; knowing ye effect &amp; hauing reaped ye profit of theſe his labors, and daily reaping it, being, and abiding in the place where this ſeed was caſt, I thought I ought to doe as willingly and as readily as anie other. If for no other cauſe, yet to commende this eſpecially to them, to bring foorth further fruite among whome it was firſt ſowen, and in whoſe heartes I doubt not, but it tooke roote nowe long ſince. An eſpeciall commendatiō of this worke, if I would take that way, might be drawen from the workeman of it moſt plentifully, from his ſtocke, and kindred, education and ſuch like; which becauſe it is rare fruite on ſuch trees, to ſome may make it ſeeme the better: but I paſſe ouer theſe ſhewes and outwarde leafes to decke it with, it hauing ynough in it ſelfe to commend it, leaſt if I ſhould long ſpeake of this colour, and grace, I ſhould ſpeake the leſſe of him, or of the thing it ſelfe, minding not to ſpeake much of either, &amp; but litle in all. And as I paſſe the ſtocke from whence this graft was taken, ſo will I not ſtand to ſhewe you where it was ingrafted &amp; planted, in what vniuerſitie, in what Colledge, what roote he toke, what ſufficient time he grew, howe he ſpred there, and with what liking, which would make this fruite to many not without cauſe to realiſh the better. But to come to that which commeth nearer to the bringing forth, and producing of this worke, when hee was firſt planted by a fellowſhippe in that famous Colledge of the holy, and vndiuided Trinitie, in Cambridge, wholly, or moſt eſpecially conſecrated to the ſtudie of him, and his knowledge, whoſe name it

beareth: ſo ſtraight he toke himſelfe to that ſtudie whereby he might be moſt ſeruiceable to gods Church, and ſome triall firſt had of his guiftes, as it were aduowed himſelfe a man to ye Lord, to ſerue in his tabernacle: Not long after, that betimes he might begin to be profitable &amp; be profitable long; God touching his heart, he toke on him the miniſterie &amp; ſo mercifully God dealt with him, yt with all he placed him in one certaine Charge, not far from his Colledge; that he might haue where to ſowe, be ſtill at hande to ſowe, and knowe both what, and how to ſowe, and to his comfort ſee the growing vp, and fruit of it. Nowe hauing there painefully laboured by the ſpace almoſt of two yeares, and ſeene the effect of that promiſe, with what meaſure ye mete,4. Mark. 24. ſhall be meaſured to you againe, and vnto them that haue ſhall more bee giuen, that though he caſt in with full hande, and euer a zelous heart to doe good, in a continued courſe; yet God ſo bleſſed, that the harueſt ouerabounded his labour, and exceeded his hope; and that litle towne was a candle light, ſet on a candleſticke, and a tower vpon the toppe of a hill. When God to his comfort had thus encouraged him in his lawe, he by great meanes calleth him from this litle towne (where he had no paſtorall charge) to a greater charge, and in reſpect of the change, and dignitie of the place whither he was called, it was as it were from Tecon to Bethel, from preaching in ſome vplandiſh, and countery towne

I hope I may without offence allude vnto that place, in all pointes it ſo fitly anſwereth: where a while abiding, by his meanes, God wrought, that the people which before in compariſon ſate in darkeneſſe ſawe great light, and to them which ſate in the region &amp; ſhadowe of death, light was riſen vp. Of this place, and this people, he hauing yet further cōpaſſion, they beeing as ſheepe without a ſhepheard, wandring in the mountaines, and the harueſt there great, and the labourers fewe; the Lorde moued his heart, to remaine there, and wrought this in the heart of his moſt honorable Lorde; himſelfe to forgoe him, and leaue him there, for the further increaſe of God his Church, and for the tender loue he bare, and good he would to this people; where what paines hath beene taken, &amp; good hath beene done, it is by more witneſſed than

               The firſt Question.
            
            
               
                  HAth there euer been in the world amongſt men ſome Religion?
            
            
               Anſ. Yea, for to make all men inexcuſable, the Lorde hath ingrafted in the minde of euerie one a ſecrete ſure perſwaſion, that there is a God: who as he made man, ſo is he of man to bee ſerued and obeyed. By which ſecrete perſwaſion it came to paſſe, that there was neuer from the beginning of the worlde any Region, Towne, or Houſe, wherein was not ſome Religion.
            
               Que. Then is not Religion a pollicie of man to keepe people in obedience?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No, it were horrible to thinke

ſo, for it is plaine that religion is of nature and by nature, though true religion be not.
            
               Que. How prooue you that?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Firſt, verie reaſon teacheth it. For what policie could euer haue made man the Lorde of all Creatures, fall down and worſhip the vileſt creatures, vnleſſe there had béen ſomething before in his nature to leade him to it? Secondly, it is plainely prooued in the example of Pilate,
               
                  Iohn. 19.8.
                who aſſoone as he heard that Chriſt was God, euen by very nature feared and ſtoode in awe of him. And by the example of Gamaliel, with diuers others.
                  Acts. 5.39.
               
            
            
               Que. Seeing then that there hath bene euer in the worlde ſome Religion, becauſe it is naturall, whether is there but one, or many?
               
            
            
               Anſ. There can be but one true Religion, but of falſe there haue béene and are diuers, and euer will be, till Chriſt come againe vnto iudgement.
            
               Que. What falſe Religion can you name?

                and out of the Church. In the Church, Poperie. Out of the Church, the religion of the Iewes, of the Gentils, and of the Turkes.
            
            
               Que. What is the Religion of the 
                        •
                     ewes?
               
            
            
               Anſ. They obſtinately denying that Chriſt is yet come, worſhippe God ſtill with ſacrifices, burnt offerings, and other ceremonies of Moſes lawe.
            
               Que. What the Gentiles?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Their Religion is a confuſed worſhipping of all things: for ſo wee 
                  •
               eade in the 14. of the Actes of the Apoſtles, in the 17. and in the 19. And the Poet ſaieth of them thus:

                  Quicquid humus, pelagus, coelum mirabile gignit,
                  Id dixere deos, colles, freta, flumina, flammas.
               
            
            That is,

                  What ſo the earth, the ſea, the heauen doeth wonderfull beget,
                  As hils, ſeas, flouds, and flames of fire for Gods that haue they ſet.
               
            
            
               
               Que. What the Turkes?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Their religion is a maſſe of all hereſies, denying Chriſt to be God, and vainely worſhipping with mans deuiſes.
            
               Que. What is true Religion?
               
            
            
               Anſ. True religion is the true worſhipping of God, and the kéeping of his commaundements.
            
               Que. Whence is it to be learned?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Onely out of the written word of God, and not out of mans heade or writings.
            
               Que. How is that prooued?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Both by Scripture and reaſon ſufficient.
            
               Que. What Scripture?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Eſay 29.13. verſe, God threateneth to plague them, becauſe their feare or religion towardes him was taught by the precept of men. Michah the 4.2. He ſhall teache vs, and we will walke in his pathes. Daniel the 9.10. Daniel confeſſeth that becauſe the people obe
                  •
               ed not Gods voyce, therefore al their worſhip was ſinne.
            
               
               Que. What reaſon?
               
            
            
               Anſ. By many might it bee prooued, but theſe may ſuffice.  Firſt, whatſoeuer pleaſeth God muſt be according to his will: but his will is onely knowen in his worde, and therefore if our Religion pleaſe God, it muſt be according to his word.  Secondly, if whatſoever bée not of faith, is ſinne, and faith onely is out of the word: then what Religion ſoever is not out of the worde, is ſinne.  Thirdly, the practiſe of Gods Church hath euer béen both to reforme religion, and to confute hereſies out of the word and by the word: and therefore the ſame muſt euer bee the grounde of our Religion.
            
               Que. Howe is it to bee learned out of the word?
               
            
            
               Anſ. By hearing it preached, by reading it our ſelves, by prayer, by conference one with another, by temptations, and by this exerciſe of Catechiſing.
            For the other, they are vſual meanes in déede, but this maner of Catechiſing

it is a newe deuiſe not knowne to our olde Fathers.
            No, it is no newe deuiſe, but an olde cuſtome and auncient, begun aſſoone as euer God had a Church, and continued euer ſince.
            
               Que. How may that be prooued?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Firſt, in the fourth of Geneſis i

therefore no newe deuiſe.
            
               Que. What be the partes of the Catechiſme?
               
            
            
               Anſ. The parts of the Catechiſme are theſe two generaly, doctrine &amp; diſcipline, &amp; vnder doctrine theſe foure contained. to wit
               
                  The law of God, a ſum whereof is in the ten Commaundements.
                  Faith, a ſum whereof is in the 12. Articles.
                  Prayer, a forme whereof is the Lordes Prayer.
                  The Sacraments.
               
Of theſe partes in order afterwarde: Now to ſome queſtions in your booke. And firſt,
            
               Que. What is the cheefeſt thing which euery one ought to be moſt careful of, ſo long as they liue?
               
            
            
               An. Euerie one ought to be moſt carefull of theſe two points, firſt and chiefely how to be ſaved in the day of iudgement, before Gods iudgement ſeate, and ſo to come to life euerlaſting. Secondly howe to liue according to Gods

holy will during our life, in which two pointes wholy ſtandeth the glorie of God, ſo much as of man ought to bee ſought for.
            
               Que. How may the firſt be prooued?
               
            
            
               
                  The firſt reaſon drawen of the vanitie of all things.
               
               Anſ. The great vanitie of all earthly things, which men ſo hunt after, doth ſhowe, that our care ſhoulde not bee ſo much of theſe matters, as it is, but rather howe to haue our ſoules ſaued, when all theſe ſhall haue their end. For conſider euē the chiefeſt deſires of men ſeuerally, and ſée how in the attaining of them there is no ſtayed comfort, and yet often doe men faile after much indeuour, and not attaine to them.
            
               Que. What chiefe deſires of men can you name vnto mee?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Mirth and ioy, a light and a chéerefull heart is greatly wiſhed,
                  Mirth and ioy.
                and ſought for of all men, by Muſicke, by ieſters, by ſportes, and playes, by much coſt and many meanes as they can, and are able: neither is this ſimplie to bee condemned in all: yet heare what ſentence the ſpirit of God hath giuen of it,

by the mouth of his ſeruaunt, who tryed the ſame, and let his experience bee our knowledge. I ſaid to my heart, ſaith he, goe to nowe,
               
                  Eccleſi. 2.1.

                  o is vanitie: I ſaid of laughter thou art mad, and of ioy, what is this, that thou doeſt? And in another place.
                  7.4.
                
               Better it is to go into the houſe of mourning, than of feaſting, becauſe this is the ende of all men, and the liuing ſhall lay it to his heart. Anger is better than laughter, for by a ſad looke the heart is made better. The heart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning: but the heart of fooles is in the houſe of myrth.

               For euery ioy that man doeth here poſſeſſe,
               A thouſand woes his minde doe dayly preſſe.
            
            Secondly to rake vp riches alſo in this world, and to poſſeſſe great wealth,
                  Riches.
                it is a thing endeuoured almoſt of all. Happie is he and wiſe accounted, who

can faſteſt attaine vnto it, yet heare and note the ſpéeche of Iames amongſt numbers moe to the ſame end.

To builde and inhabite great and goodly houſes howe many men bewitched with vanitie,
                  Buildings.
                delight in it, and with much care and coſt applie themſelues vnto it? Yet ſée they, or may ſée the ſpéeche of Salomon vpon experience ſaying, I haue made my great workes, I haue built me houſes, I haue planted me vineyards, I haue made me gardens and orchards, and planted in them trees of all fruite, and ſo forth. Yea euen whatſoeuer mine eyes deſired, I withhelde it not from them, neyther withdrew I my heart from any ioie, then I looked on all my works that my hands had wrought, and on the trauell that I had laboured to doe, and beholde all is

vanitie, and vexation of the ſpirite, and there is no profite vnder the Sun. When it ſhalbe ſaide to them as it was to that purpoſing builder in the Goſpell, Thou foole this night ſhall they take away thy ſoule,
               
                  Luke. 12.20.
                then may it alſo folow &amp; fitly be demanded, whoſe ſhal theſe ſtately houſes be? Thus eyther may they knowe the vanitie of their dealing, but yet wil not, or elſe doe they knowe it, but regarde it not.
            Apparell againe is another of the raging deſires of many.
                  Apparell.
                Euen a worlde it is to ſée howe all, as dead, doe taſt no ſinne in it, but ſpend and ſpare not what poſſiblie may be gotten to beſtowe on it, yet what beginning had it? Was it not then inuented, when man had ſinned, grieuouſlie offended his God, and caſt himſelfe away both bodie and ſoule? Séeing then in our integritie it was not vſed, but after ſinne, beſtowed on man to hide his ſhame withall, what may it euer beate into vs, but our rebellion againſt the Lorde, our ſinne and curſed diſobedience? Howe ſhould the

ſight of it and vſe of it humble vs, and not puffe vs vp, ſeeing it plainely telleth vs, we are not as we were when no apparell was worne, and yet no ſhame thereby? Were it not monſtrous pride, if a redéemed priſoner conditionally, that he ſhould euer weare an halter, ſhould waxe prowde of his halter? Mans apparell is the badge of a ſinner, yea of a condemned and curſed ſinner, &amp; therefore the pride of it and delight in it, no doubt very monſtrous before the Lorde, and hatefull. If euery ſilken ſute and gorgeous gowne in Englande ſhrowded vnder it a ſaued ſoule, and a ſanctified bodie in the ſight of God, O happie then England of all the nations vnder heauē. But if vnder ſuch garded garments, may, and doeth lodge a body and ſoule abhorred of the Lorde, that in the day of wrath ſhall finde no fauour: then is it not apparell, that ought to be ſought after, but in the day of iudgemēt how we may be ſaued.
                  Credite and fauour with the world.
                What ſhould I ſay of fauor &amp; credit with great eſtates in the worlde, of countenance and authoritie?

O howe doe men deſire it, and ſéeke it ſewe and ſerue for it, their care both day and night is howe to attaine the faſteſt to it, &amp; yet what more tickle than the ſtate hereof, if GOD gaue vs hearts to marke it? For how ſoone faded the credite of Dauid with his wauer n

                when he committed all thinges to him that euer he had, ſauing his wife, to be at his direction? Yet euen in a moment without cauſe falſely ſlaundered, all credite loſt, and he clapt cloſe vp in priſon. Many ſuch examples hath the worde, and all hiſtories, and therefore truely ſaide he it, whoſoeuer ſaide it, as the Counter, ſo is the Courtier, for that ſtandeth euen nowe for a thouſand poundes, and

by and by through a litle remooue, but for a halfepenie, and ſo he, to day in all glorie, to morowe in litle or none. Yet not more the Courtier, than euen euery man in his place and ſeruice, to day truſted, to morow ſuſpected, to day loued, to morowe miſliked, to day with deſire entertayned and made of, to morowe as néedeleſſe caſt off &amp; contemned. Fickle therefore is the worldly fauour, and greater good there is for men to ſéeke after.

                another of the daily deſires of worldly men. This they ſéeke, this they couet, this day and night they beat their heads about. Yet daily examples be before their faces of ſorowe and tormēt not to be expreſſed, growing to parentes by ſuch proude and gréedie attempts, beſide the continuall griefe, that ſonne or daughter ſo beſtowed often riſeth and goeth to bed withall. Therefore I ſay, to goe no further, ſince theſe vſuall deſires of men in this worlde are often not attained vnto to their liking,

ſhall heare theſe words, Depart ye wicked into endleſſe woe. What an honor woulde I thinke it, if the Prince paſſing by among the great multitude, ſhould ſpie mee out, call mee to him, imbrace me, ſpeake kindly to me, take mee with him, place me by him, and ſo forth? Howe would my heart daunce hereat, and all men talke of my good hap? Now is the paſſing of a mortall Prince on earth like the comming of Ieſus Chriſt in the cloudes?
            Is the honour they can giue, comparable to that the Lorde of Lordes ſhall giue to his elect? O my heart féeleth what my pen cannot write, there is no compariſon betwixt the perſons, the places, the preferments, and therefore if the one ſo ioy mée, that for it I would take any paines, thriſe dead is my heart within me, if to obtaine the other it bée not carefull.

                the examples of care continuall and great euer in Gods children how they might ſerue him, and pleaſe him, that hereafter they might ſit with

him, and neuer part from him, ought mightily to perſwade vs to be like vnto them in this indeuour, their labours, their watchings, their ſufferings, all ſhot but at this ende, the glorie of the Lorde, and their owne ſaluation, and howe great were they? What ſpéeches of deſire, euen aboue all treaſure, to bée ſaued in the great day, haue they vttered? And ſhall we not followe them? God forbid. Thus therefore prooued vnto vs is the firſt point of a Chriſtian man and womans care, namely that it ought to be this, howe they ſhould be ſaued in the day of iudgement, and ſo come to life euerlaſting.
            
               Que. Howe is the ſecond point prooued vnto vs, namely that in the meane time, ſo long as wee liue in this world, wee ought to bee carefull to liue according to Gods holy will?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Surely it is prooued verie ſtrongly vnto vs both by our election, creation, redemption, iuſtification and vocation, if we will marke them. For why hath the Lord elected vs to eternal

ioy in Chriſt Ieſus? That wee might conclude libertie thereon to ſinne at our pleaſure,
                  Our election prooueth it.
                as many wicked ſpirites reaſon? No no. But let the Apoſtle bee iudge and tell vs why, who ſaieth:
                  Epheſ. 1.4.
                
               He hath choſen vs in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould bee holy and without blame before him in loue. So ſaieth he of our creation alſo,
                  Our creation prooueth it.
                
               that wee are the Lordes workemanſhip created in Chriſt Ieſus to good workes,
               
                  Epheſ. 2.10.
                
               which GOD hath ordained that wee ſhoulde walke in them. And of our redemption Luke plainely ſpeaketh,
                  Our redemption prooueth it.
                
               that we are deliuered out of the hands of our enemies,
               
                  Luke. 1.

                  Our iuſtification prooueth it.

                  •
               anctification, and they cannot bee parted. For howe ſhall we, ſaieth the Apoſtle,
                  Rom. 6.2.
                
               that are dead to ſinne liue yet therein? and ſo forth, as followeth in the place. Laſtly of our vocation the Apoſtle Peter ſaieth thus, As he that hath called is holy, ſo be you holy in all manner

of conuerſation. So that wee ſée thereby all theſe meanes prooued vnto vs, that we ought as long as we liue to be carefull of this, that we behaue our ſelues according to the will of the Lord, which is the ſeconde point whereof in your queſtion ye demaunded ſome confirmation.
            
               Que. But howe can we knowe we are diſcharged before Gods iudgement ſeate?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Your booke anſwereth you, that wee can neuer knowe howe wee be diſcharged before the iudgement ſeate of God, vntill ſuch time as we knowe our owne miſerable eſtates by reaſon of the greatneſſe of our ſinne, and the horrible puniſhment, which we deſerue for the ſame. And the proofes your booke vſeth are plaine to inferre this concluſion. For doeth man ſéeke to the Phiſition that hath no néede of health either to be procured or preſerued by his meanes? No our owne experience doth approue the ſpeach of Chriſt to bee true, when he ſaieth,
                  Matth. 9.12.
                
               The whole haue no neede of the

Phiſition, but the ſicke.
               
                  Matth. 11.13.
                For in déede it is the diſeaſed that take care to bee helped. It is the trauailing and heauie laden ſoule that ſigheth to be refreſhed. It is the ſinner that thinketh of all ſinners he is the chiefeſt,
                  1. Tim. 1.15.
                which longeth for pardon. And to ende,
                  Matth. 9.13.
                as Chriſt came not to call the righteous but the ſinners to repentance, ſo aſſuredly it is the ſinner, I meane he that in déede féeleth ye waight of ſinne, and knoweth his owne miſerable eſtate by reaſon of it, and the puniſhment due vnto it, I ſay it is that man and that woman, that ſéeketh what way to be diſcharged, and none elſe.
            
               Que. And howe doe wee knowe the greatneſſe of our ſinne, and the horrible puniſhment due to the ſame?
               
            
            
               Anſ. We knowe it ſaieth the booke, by the lawe of God rightly vnderſtoode, the ſumme whereof is contained in the ten commaundements.
                  Rom. 3.20.
                For by the law commeth the knowledge of ſinne, ſaith Saint Paul, and reade the 7. Chapter from the 7. verſe to the 13. and marke it.

Fitly then followeth the firſt part of my diuiſion of the Catechiſme before, to wit the lawe.
            
               Que. What is the firſt Commaundement?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Thou ſhalt haue none other Gods but mée.
            
               Que. What is the meaning of this Commandement?
               
            
            
               Anſ. The Lorde ſtraightly chargeth vs in this Commaundement,
                  The Booke.
                that wee worſhip GOD alone. Which worſhip ſtandeth in 4. pointes. Firſt, that wee loue God aboue all. Secondly, that wee feare God aboue all. Thirdly, that wée make our prayers to none but to God. Fourthly, that wee acknowledge God alone to be the guider and gouernour of all things, of whom we receiue all the benefites that we haue, and therefore that we truſt and ſtay vpon him alone.
            
               Que. Can we doe any of theſe things vnleſſe we know God?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No, it is impoſſible, for all theſe dueties ſpring of the knowledge of God, and the more we knowe him, the

more we loue him, the more wee feare him, and euery way ſerve him.
            
               Que. And what is the firſt point of the knowledge of God?
               
            
            
               Anſ. To knowe that there is a God, without which knowledge ſaith the Apoſtle, no man can come vnto God.
                  Hebrues. 11.

               Que. What wayes haue we to know that there is a God by?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Firſt, wee knowe by the creatures that there is a God.
                  Pſal. 19.
                For the heauens declare the glorie of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handie worke, ſaieth the Prophet. To whom agreeth the Apoſtle alſo ſaying that,
                  Rom. 1.19.
                
               That which is to bee knowen of God, is manifeſt in them. For the inuiſible things of him, as his eternall power, and Godhead, are ſeene by the creation of the world, &amp;c. As by the greatneſſe of this worlde and of many particular creatures in it, as alſo by his making all things of nothing, wee ſée his great power, by the varietie and notable order of the creatures, we ſée his wiſedome, and by the vſe that wee haue of them, wee ſée his

goodneſſe, &amp;c.
            
               Que. Howe elſe knowe we that there is a God?
               
            
            
               Anſ. By his worde written, as our fathers in olde time did knowe him becauſe they heard him ſpeake to them. For by his worde he is to vs, as by his audible voyce he was to them, vnleſſe we be Infidels.
            
               Que. Thirdly howe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Thirdly, The ſpirit of GOD knoweth the things that are of God, and doeth reueile them, ſaith the Apoſtle, amongſt which this is one, that there is a God. Which the ſame ſpirit doeth ſo ingraue in euerie one, that is elected, as he that féeleth not himſelfe paſt doubting of it, is verie iuſtly for to feare, he belongeth not yet vnto the Lord.
            
               Que. Fourthly how prooue you there is a God?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Euery mans conſcience accuſing him, &amp; fearing him, when he doeth euill, excuſing him and comforting him when he doeth well, telleth him plainely there is a God, which puniſheth euil,

               Que. Howe many Gods are there?
               
            
            
               Anſ. But one onely God. And that 
                  •
               o my heart I prooue,  Firſt by the ſcrip

                  Epheſ. 4.6. 1. Tim. 2.
                And 
                  •
               n an other place, There is one GOD, 
                     •
                  nd one mediator betwixt God &amp; man, 
                     •
                  uen ye man Ieſus Chriſt. 
                Secondly by al 
                  •
               he prayers of the godly in the Church, which are directed but to one only God, and therefore wee knowe there are no moe.  Thirdly by this commandement, where he ſaith not, Thou ſhalt haue none other Gods but vs, but in the ſingular number, none but me.  Fourthly, 
                  •
               y the conſent of Gods Church, which hath euer from time to time condemned them as heretikes, which ſaid there were any mo.  And laſtly by reaſon: For God is infinite, and there can be but one infinite. Therfore but one God, &amp;c.
            
               Que. Howe many perſons are there?
               
            
            
               
               Anſ. Thrée perſons. As firſt I learn
                  •
                by the third of Matthewe, where the father ſpeaketh from heauen and ſaieth, This is my beloued Sonne,
               
                  Matth. 3.
                
               heare him. The ſonne is baptiſed, and the holy Ghoſt like a Doue deſcendeth. Secondly by the words of Chriſt, Goe &amp; teach all nations baptiſing them, In the name of the father, of the ſonne, &amp; of the holy Ghoſt. If there had béene any more perſons, Chriſt would haue named them and haue commaunded the ſame to bée done in their names alſo. Or elſe there is inequalitie in the Godhead, therefore we knowe there are but thrée perſons and no moe.
            
               Que. What is God?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No man is able to define fully what God is in his eſſence. But wée muſt content our ſelues to knowe him by his attributes, namelie that hee is ſtrong, mightie, mercifull, wiſe, ſlowe to anger, of great goodneſſe, and ſo foorth, as he is deſcribed vnto vs by himſelfe in his worde.
            
               Que. What is nowe the firſt duetie

                     
                        •
                     hat ſpringeth of the knowledge of God?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Of this knowledge of God ariſeth firſt a true loue of him before and aboue all things whatſoeuer. Which 
                  •
               s when my heart euen effectually fée
               
                  •
               ing how wonderfully he loued me firſt, 
                  •
               n electing, creating, redéeming, and iuſtifying me in Chriſt Ieſus, beſides infinite benefites elſe beſtowed in bodie and mind vpon me, doth euen burne in affection towards him againe, ſubmitteth it ſelfe wholy to him, ſerueth him with chéerefulneſſe, &amp; maketh in trueth more account of him and his will, than of all the worlde, yea than euen of mine owne ſaluation, if they could come in compariſon together.
            
               Que. Howe prooue you that I am thus bounde to loue God?
               
            
            
               Anſ. It is prooued by Chriſt our Sauiours words, He that loueth father or mother, ſiſter or brother, wife or child,
               
                  Matth. 10.37.
                
               or any thing more than me, is not worthie of me, &amp; by ye practiſe of the bleſſed Apoſtle, who when he knew Chriſt once, accounted

               thoſe things which were vantage vnto him loſſe for Chriſt his ſake, yea euen all things he eſteemed loſſe for the excellent knowledge ſake of Chriſt Ieſus his Lorde, and did iudge them to bee doung that he might win Chriſt. And certainely, what heart of man or woman ſoeuer knoweth God indéede what he is in himſelfe, and to all men, and particularlie to it many thouſande wayes, as impoſſible it is, it ſhould not loue God againe aboue all, and euen grone that it can loue him no more, as it is vnpoſſible fier ſhould want heate or water moyſture.
            
               Que. What braunches hath the loue of God ſpringing out of it?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Whoſoeuer loueth God, loueth alſo his worde,
               
                  Pſal. 119. verſ. 103. Luke. 10. 1. Theſſ. 5. 1. Iohn. 3.17. Pſal. 15.1.

               Anſ. To feare him aboue all.
            
               Que. What feare is meant here?

                        •
                     ifference of feare.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Verie true it is. For there are 
                  •
               wo kindes of feare of God, one a ſer

                  ••
               nlike feare, and this is meant here.
            
               
               Que. Howe may we knowe whether this true feare of God be in vs or no?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Truely as we knowe there is fire by the ſmoke, and that a man liueth by his breathing, ſo we may knowe by the effects that the feare of God doeth bring forth in them in whom it is, whether it be in vs or no?
            
               Que. Why? what be the effects?
               
            
            
               Anſ. As the banke doeth kéepe the water from ouerflowing, ſo doeth the feare of God in man or woman kéepe out ſinne that it ſpred not as otherwiſe it would. We ſée it in practiſe prooued before our eyes. For when Pharaoh king of Egypt,
               
                  Exod. 1.17.
                commaunded them to kill euery male childe that was borne of the Iſraelites women, what kept out this cruell murther both from hand and heart, but this banke, the feare and awe of God, more than man, for ſo ſaith the text, the midwiues feared GOD, and therefore did not as the King commanded them. The like may we ſée in Iob, who ſaith Gods puniſhment was fearefull to him,
                  Iob. 31.32.

Sée howe he ſaieth by hearing men learne this feare of God, and bréede it or increaſe it.
            
               Que. When is the feare of God to be learned?
               
            
            
               Anſ. At all times, but eſpecially when oportunitie either of teaching or learning doeth ſerue vs. For that we ought to take oportunitie of teaching, our ſauiour Chriſt himſelfe affirmeth, ſaying, Yet a litle, and the light is with you, walk while you haue the light. And that we ſhould then learne when we our ſelues are able and apt to learne, the wiſe man ſheweth in theſe wordes, Remember thy creator in the daies of thy youth,
               
                  Eccleſi. 12.1.
                
               before the euill daies come and thy yeres approche, wherein thou ſhalt ſay, I haue no pleaſure in them. Alſo the often and ſodaine loſſe of hearing and ſéeing by ſundrie occaſions doth vehemently admoniſh vs to take time while time is, and learne to feare God while we may. For to day we can reade per aduenture our ſelues, &amp; if not, yet at leaſt heare others, but to morow who is

ſure hee ſhall eyther haue eies to ſée to reade himſelfe, or ſenſe of hearing to heare others? Therefore againe take time when we may.
            
               Que. What is contrarie to the feare of God?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Too much to ſtande in feare of men and their threats, ſo that by them wee are driuen to any vnlawfull things. Too much to feare God, himſelfe and his iudgements, as deſperate men doe, which nouriſh no hope of his mercie and goodneſſe. Thirdly ſecuritie and too litle feare of God, with many ſuch moe. All theſe are contrarie to that true feare of God, which we ſpeake of, and are as well forbidden here as the other is commaunded.
            
               Que. What is the third duetie of this commaundement?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Thirdly we are here commaunded to make our prayers to none but to God.
            
               Que. Howe may it bee prooued that onely God of true Chriſtians is to bee praied vnto, ſince other doctrine is deliuered

by the Church of Rome?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Firſt it is prooued by the words of the Apoſtle Paul,
               
                  Rom. 10.
                
               Howe ſhal they call vpon him in whome they haue not beleeued: as though he ſhould ſay, Beléefe muſt néedes euer goe before prayer, whereupon then thus wee may reaſon. Wee muſt onely pray to him in whom we muſt beléeue, but we may &amp; ought beléeue onely in God the Father, God the Sonne, and GOD the holie Ghoſt, therefore onely to theſe thrée perſons one onely God muſt our prayers be directed.
            The firſt propoſition we ſée prooued by Paul, the ſecond by the articles of our faith, &amp; all the ſcripture, the concluſion followeth vpon thē both. Secondly  it is prooued by Chriſt himſelfe, who teaching his Apoſtles to pray, and in them all other men, biddeth them neither call vpon Angel nor ſaint, no not vpon his mother Marie. But when you pray ſaith he, ſay Our Father which art in heauē. That is, what forme of words ſo euer you vſe, euer direct your praiers

vnto God and to him only. And Father in this place ſignifieth any of the thrée perſons, and is not to be reſtrained onely to the firſt perſon.
            Thirdly wee haue no commaundement to pray to any but to God onely, we haue no promiſe to be heard if wee doe, no example in Scriptures of any godly man or woman that hath done it euer at any time, or vpon any occaſion, we haue no puniſhment threatened, if we doe it not: but to pray to God we are commaunded,
                  Pſal. 50.
                we are promiſed to be helped, we haue examples, and we are threatened if we doe it not. Therefore whether of theſe two is to be done, who ſéeth not?
            
               Que. What is the fourth duetie of this commaundement?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Fourthly we are bound by this Lawe to acknowledge God alone to be the guider and gouernour of all things, of whom we receiue all the benefites that we haue, and therefore that wee truſt and ſtay vpon him alone.
            
               Que. Here are three ſeuerall thinges

affirmed very worthie to be ſeuerallie conſidered, and therfore firſt I pray you, howe is it prooued that God guideth &amp; gouerneth all things?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Beſides a number of other places which might be alledged to prooue it withal, a very good teſtimonie is that in the Pſalme: Whatſoeuer pleaſed the Lorde, that did he in heauen and earth,
               
                  Pſal. 135.6.
                
               in the ſea, and in all the depth. Where marke well the ſpace of the Lordes dominion, in heauen he rulech, in earth he ruleth, in the ſea he ruleth, and in all theſe whatſoeuer it pleaſeth him, that doeth he at all times and ſeaſons. The like ſpéeche againe hath the ſame Prophet in an other place,
                  Pſal. 115.3.
                
               But our God is in heauen, ſaith he, and doeth whatſoeuer he wil, The eyes of all things waite vpon him,
               
                  Pſal. 145.15.
                
               and he giueth them meate in due ſeaſon. So then nothing without him is done at any time, but his power almightie guideth and gouerneth all things.
            
               Que. Howe is it prooued that all good commeth to vs from this directing prouidence

of the Lorde.
               
            
            
               Anſ. The holy ghoſt in plaine words affirmeth it by his Apoſtle Iames,
               
                  Iames. 1.17.
                
               Euery good giuing &amp; euery perfect gift is from aboue, and commeth downe from the father of light.
            
            
               Que. This doctrine is plaine. And yet notwithſtāding euer it hath had, &amp; euen in theſe dais hath ſom enemies. Such obiectiōs as I haue hard at times, I wil propound vnto you, &amp; I pray you aunſwere thē. The firſt is this, if God rule all things by his prouidence &amp; direction, then muſt he needs be author of ſin alſo, in that he hindreth it not but ſuffreth it to be done.
               
            
            
               Anſ. I anſwere to this your firſt doubt thus: that the argument is not good, neither foloweth, that béecauſe all thinges are doone by his prouidence, therefore hée ſhould be author of euill. For one may bée author of an action, &amp; yet not of the euil in the action: as in this ſimilitude wée ſée: If a man cut with an euill knife, hee is the cauſe of cutting, but not of euill cutting or hackling of the knife, but the badneſſe

of the knife is the cauſe of that. Againe, if a man ſtrike the ſtringes of an inſtrument that is out of tune, he is the cauſe that the ſtringes ſounde, but that they ſounde iarringlie and out of tune, that is in themſelues, and the man that ſtriketh is not to bée blamed for it. Therefore ſéeing one maie bée the cauſe of an action, and yet not of the euil in the action, you ſée it doth not folowe, that if God bée the cauſe of the action, by and by the euill in the thing muſt néedes alſo procéede of him. Nay contrarilie this doctrine is a ſealed truth, That no euill commeth of GOD in any worke, but though in euerie thing that is done, the Lord bée ſome worker, yet as he doth it, it is euer good. Marke but an example or two.
                  Iob. 1.
                
               Iob his great aduerſitie procéeded of God, and by God in ſome reſpect, it procéedeth of Satan alſo, and of the Chaldeans that robbed him. Yet ſée, that which Satan did malitiouſly, and the Chaldeans couetouſly, that did the Lord well &amp; to good purpoſe, to the glorie of his name, to the inſtruction and

comfort of vs all, and to Iobs great benefite alſo.
                  Gen. 38.
                
               Ioſephs affliction againe, it came by God, by his brethren, by his light miſtreſſe, and ouer credulous maſter, but yet ſo much as God did, was well done, to the great benefite of his father and friends after, and what the other did, was euill &amp; wrongfully done to Ioſeph. The like againe may be ſaid touching the death of Chriſt. Had not God his worke in it, when his determinate counſell appointed it,
                  Act. 2.23.
                and deliuered him vp? Had not Iudas his worke in betraying him? Had not the Iewes their worke whoſe wicked hands crucified and ſlew him? Yet that which they did moſt horriblie, the Lorde himſelfe did in vnſpeakeable mercie to all our endeleſſe comfortes. Therefore whatſoeuer procéedeth of GOD, as it commeth from him, it is moſt good, although the ſame thing as it commeth of man and by man, bée wicked and euill, and no author of euill is he, though guider and gouernour of all things.
            
               
               Que. My ſeconde doubt then is this, if GOD gouerne all thinges by his prouidence, then looke howe hee liſt to haue things, and ſo ſhall they be, men cannot chaunge his will, and therefore it skilleth not what wee doe.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Surely the concluſion is very wicked, and no way followeth vpon Gods prouidence. For albeit he direct all things, yet we muſt euer vſe the meanes that God hath appointed notwithſtanding, for ſo we ſée Gods children euer did and tempted not the Lord by any ſuch wicked ſpéeche as this. Rebecca had heard Gods owne mouth ſpeake it,
                  Gen. 27.
                that hee would of her two ſonnes Eſau and Iacob make two nations, and the elder ſhould ſerue the younger, whereby ſhe well knew Eſau could not kill Iacob, whatſoeuer he threatened: yet did ſhe not preſume careleſlie thereon, and ſaid to her ſelfe it ſkilled not what ſhe did, but ſhe vſed the ordinarie meanes to ſaue Iacobs life, and ſent him out of the countrie for a time.

Numbers of theſe examples are in the Scripture. Let this one moe of Chriſt himſelfe ſuffice,
                  Iohn. 17.
                who prayed to his father to glorifie him, and yet was hee moſt ſure of it before, all to teache vs to vſe ordinarie meanes. Therefore Gods prouidence neuer ought to preiudice ſuch meanes as he hath appointed to obtaine any thing by, neither in déede doeth in the godlie.
            
               Que. My thirde obiection is this, If God ruled all by his prouidence, then ſhould there bee no miſorder at al in the world as there is.
               
            
            
               Anſ. No more there is in déede and trueth, I meane in reſpect of God.
            
               Que. No? is not this euill in the world, and in regarde of God wrong, that euill men ſhould thriue and flouriſh as they doe, and the godlie not?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No indéede. For good men and women are afflicted in this world for their good, namely that they may not bee condemned with the worlde. And euill men receiue Gods bleſſings to make them without all excuſe, and

               o increaſe their damnation if they ſerue not God.
            
               Que. Why, but did not Ioſephs bre

                     hren ill and they that killed Chriſt?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Yea in déede they did horriblie as I haue ſaide before, but yet GOD directed all to his glorie, to the benefite of his Church, and our euerlaſting comfort by Chriſt, and therefore in Gods gouernement all was then well and euer is.
            
               Que. What then is the concluſion?
               
            
            
               Anſ. The concluſion is this, as hath béene ſaide, that in trueth there 
                  •
               s no miſorder in the worlde in reſpect of God. For all that euer he doeth, or 
                  •
               etteth be done is good and for good, but all miſorder is in reſpect of man.
            
               Que. What is the fruite and vſe of this doctrine of Gods prouidence?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Very great. For it maketh vs in well &amp; woe giue glory to god, who ſends

for comfort, who will not ſée vs want▪ and many good fruits it worketh in vs, if throughly we be perſwaded of it.
            
               Que. Next nowe what maner of conſequence is this in the booke, that becauſe God guideth all thinges, and o
                        •
                      him wee receiue all thinges, therefore wee ſhoulde truſt and ſtay vppon him alone?
               
            
            
               Anſ. The conſequence is very good. For the former ſetled in the heart once by faith, euer begetteth the ſeconde in man or woman, and they cannot bee parted. We ſée a plaine proofe of it in Dauid, who being in déede perſwaded that the Lorde was his ſhepheard, by and by concludeth thereupon, therefore ſhall I want nothing.
               
                  Pſal. 23.
               
            
            
               Que. But what if I a fraile man or woman doe yet find my ſelfe weake in truſting to the Lord, and in the Lord, when trouble aſſaileth me, how might I helpe this great infirmitie, and increaſe my truſt in the Lords mercie?

as the Apoſtle ſayeth are not ſanctified otherwiſe vnto vs,
                  1. Tim. 4.
                ſo that we may receiue them with a good conſcience, then by the word and prayer, and alſo in reſpect of the breach of Gods commaundementes, who expreſſely willed his people Iſrael, &amp; in them euen all others, that when they had eaten &amp; filled themſelues,
                  Deutro. 8.10.
                they ſhould bleſſe the Lord their God for the good lande which he had giuen them. Beſide which reaſons yet euen further we haue the practiſe of the godly to call vppon vs for this duetie. For it is well noted that the ſame people choſen of the Lorde, the Iewes I meane, did not ſit downe to eate, but either the good man of the houſe, or he that was Primarius in menſa, that is the chiefe man at the table, did take either the bread or the cup in his hand, and ſo holding it, prayed vnto the Lorde, that he would vouchſafe to bleſſe them and thoſe his good giftes, which then they were about to receiue at his mercifull hand. Likewiſe after meate they gaue him thankes for it. Hence commeth

the mention of taking the cuppe twiſe by our Sauiour Chriſt in Luke,
               
                  Luke 22.17.
                the former taking was this ſaying of grace and giuing of thankes which I 
                  •
               peake of, the other was the celebration of his ſupper. Howe euen of purpoſe alſo doeth the Euangeliſt mention this ſame practiſe ſtill in Chriſt,
                  Matth. 14.19. Marke. 6 41. Mark. 14.26.
                ſometimes ſaying when they had ſung

                  •

                  •
               hat ſhameth to doe Gods commaundements, and conſequently maketh vs

eate our own damnation, the creatures being not ſanctified vnto vs. And O damnable following of our wicked cuſtome, and leauing the cuſtome of Chriſt and his children. God in mercie awake vs. For aſſuredlie wee litle knowe what we doe, when we pretermit and ſhame to doe this dutie to the Lorde.
            
               Que. You haue well ſatisfied me touching the neceſſitie of this duetie, and nowe I aske you an other queſtion, whether we may not alſo giue thankes to men, but whatſoeuer they ſay or doe to vs, yea if they drinke but to vs at the table, wee muſt ſay, I thanke God?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Truly to be perſwaded that any kindnes or good can come to vs by men▪ from men, whereof our mercifull God is not the ſender and giuer, woorking by thoſe inſtrumēts, were verie wicked &amp; horrible: but for the phraſe of ſpéech my heart knowing GOD to be th
                  •
                author, I may well and lawfully vſ
                  •
                it to the inſtrument no doubt, and ſay

I thanke you, at any time or vpon any occaſion, when I reape the benefite of their loue, and by name vpon ſuch occaſion as you named. And this I take to be warranted by the practiſe of Paul,
               
                  Rom. 16.3. &amp; 4.
                who no doubt in heart knew God to be author of all his good, &amp; yet are his words directed to ye inſtruments. Greet Priſcilla and Aquila, ſaith he, my fellow helpers in Chriſt Ieſus. Which haue for my life laide downe their necke, vnto whom not onely I giue thankes, but alſo all the Churches of the Gentiles.
            
            
               Que. As you haue ſaid of the other duties, ſo I take it in this alſo: namelie that whatſoeuer is contrarie or againſt it, is as well forbidden vs by this firſt commandement, as this is commaunded.
               
            
            
               Anſ. It is very true. Both the pretermiſſion of thanks for any goodnes vpon

               Que. Thus reſt I inſtructed more than I was touching this commaundement the firſt of all the ten. And now onely I could wiſh, if you might, that you would ſhewe me ſome way howe profitablie to examine mine owne heart touching this Lawe, and howe with my ſelfe I might meditate vpon it fruitefully, and with feeling.
               
            
            
               Anſ Indéed your requeſt hath great profite in it, and that courſe or practiſe ye nowe deſire, ſhall any man or woman finde very fruitefull, if they doe vſe it. For euen as in earthly matters our affection and loue cleaueth faſteſt to them, that in greateſt extremities haue brought vs helpe and eaſe, and as there is nothing yt will blowe vp the coale of that remembraunce more vehemently, and make it flame out into open ſhewe of a thankefull heart, more effectually than ſome true meditation of the greatneſſe of daunger, and gréeuouſneſſe of eſtate that we were in before: So in

heauenly and ſpiritual things the ſame is found as true, or rather more, that ſight of greateſt good procureth greateſt meaſure of ſuch fruite as ought to flow thereof. For by example what ſo kindeleth in a man the heate of burning loue, and maketh his heart to flame with true affection to his God, as doeth

for ſuch a friende. True it is therefore that the leſſe we ſée the goodneſſe of our God, the leſſe we loue him: but great is the affection of them, to whom many ſinnes are forgiuen. Knowing this then that remembraunce of hard eſtate before will ſtirre the heart vp to him in loue that hath made it happie, and that ſight of ougly ſinne lodging ſtill in mée and cleauing to my ſoule and fleſh will make mee praiſe his name, who yet in mercie imputeth not the ſame vnto mée: Vſe indéede often with your ſelfe, and eſpecially when you féele your heart moſt prone and fit thereunto, to viewe your ſinnes againſt euery commaundement, howe many and monſtrous they are in thought, worde and deede, ſit and thinke with your ſelfe what is commaunded, ſometimes in one, ſometimes in another, what woonderfull perfection is required in euerie one, what braunches and members euerie one hath, what terrible iudgements are due to the breakers therof, how far from

                  •
               nto a fewe. Firſt I ſée I am bound to 
                  •
               oue him aboue all, that is, in my heart

and ſoule to make more account of him than of all the worlde or any creature in heauen or earth, to cleaue faſter vnto him and his wil than to any thing, to eſtéeme him and preferre him, yea euen aboue mine owne ſaluation, if they could come in compariſon together, for, Hee that loueth father or mother,
               
                  Matth. 10.28.
                
               ſiſter or brother, wife or childe, or any thing more than me, is not worthie of me. Secondly I am commaunded to feare him aboue all, that is with a godly reuerence to ſtande more in awe of him and his worde, than of any thing elſe whatſoeuer, to be more loath, not for feare onely, but euen for loue to diſpleaſe him, grieue him, and offende him, than any or all the creatures in heauen or earth beſide, in reſpect of that which he is able to lay vpon mee, if I forſake him, to account nothing of any thing that any man can doe vnto me, mindefull euer of this ſaying: Feare not them that can kill the bodie, and are not able to kill the ſoule:
               
                  Matth. 10.
                
               but feare him that can caſt both bodie and

ſoule into hell fire. Thirdly I ſée that in this commaundement I am charged to make my prayers to none but to God onely, for the reaſons aboue in their place alledged. Fourthly I ſée I am commaunded not to thinke that things goe by fortune and chaunce, or that any thing is done which GOD knoweth not of, or could not let, but that I acknowledge him to be the guider and gouernour of all things, and that what good ſoeuer I receiue I haue it from him, and therefore that I truſt and ſtay vpon him alone at all times, and in all my matters whatſoeuer. And for ſo much as neither I nor any can either loue him, or feare him, pray to him, or truſt in him, vnleſſe we knowe him: therefore I ſée alſo that I am in this commaundement ſtraitely bound 
                  •
               o long as I liue, to labour and trauell by all meanes appointed to knowe the Lorde, and his trueth out of his worde: and looke howe much I want of knowing any thing, that is reueiled in his worde, ſo farre am I guiltie of

the breache of this Lawe. And if it pleaſe ye Lorde to bleſſe me with knowledge of his trueth, or any thing elſe whatſoeuer, I ſée that in this commandement I am charged to giue thankes to him for it in ſuch full manner and meaſure of féeling, as any way is due to that benefite. For if I forget to be thankefull, I forget that the Lorde in that thing is my good God. And if I aſcribe the praiſe and thankes to any thing elſe whatſoeuer, otherwiſe than as to the inſtrument of God, I make my ſelfe another GOD beſide the Lorde, euen that thing, wherevnto I giue the thankes, and I breake this commaundement. Theſe and many ſuch other things I ſée are laide vpon me and al men, and women in this firſt commandement, &amp; then I thinke or ſay with my ſelf vnto ye Lord, O my good God and gratious father, O my ſwéete Lord &amp; guide moſt righteous, what doe I ſée euen in this but one law of thine againſt my ſelfe, my ſoule and bodie, why I ſhould neuer come in thy kingdome,

nor lift vp mine eyes to heauen in hope of any comfort? This is but one Lawe of ten, and contayneth but a fewe dueties in reſpect of all that I owe to thée and my brethren, yet ah Lorde, with wailing woe I ſpeake it, ſo guiltie I ſée my ſelfe, ſo fowle and ouglie before thy face, and ſo full of breaches euerie way, euen of this one commandement, that I am aſhamed and confounded to

                  •
               ill hee loue him? No no, full ſoone

euen I my ſelfe would loath and caſt off ſuch a one. Ah Lorde then for my ſelfe what ſhould I ſay? Is there any ſeruaunt ſo bound vnto his maſter, as I am bounde to thee? Is there any maſter that can and will ſo quitte his ſeruaunts paines, as thou in mercie my obedience? Or can any mortall man ſo iuſtly challenge the obedience of his hireling, as thou my God maiſt challenge the ſeruice of me thy creature, firſt made of nothing by thy hande, and then moſt dearely bought againe with precious price? No no, my bodie, my life, my heart, my ſoule, and whatſoeuer I am, within, or without, of thée I had all, and to thée my gratious God I owe them all againe. Yet ſée, ah wretche, and wofull plight, although thy goodneſſe to mee farre paſſeth all maſters their ſeruaunts, and my duetie to thee more due ten thouſand times than any mans vnto his maſter, yet is my diſobedience greater, the ſinne of my ſoule more grieuous, and the whole courſ
                  •
                of my wicked life more oppoſed to thy

will, than euer was any earthly ſeruaunts to any hard and euill maſter. For he will doe ſomething that hee is bidden, but I haue done nothing, as I plainely ſée by viewing of my life, and as my conſcience telleth me being priuie to my pathes. For haue I loued thée as I ought? Namely euen with all my heart, with all my ſoule, with all my ſtrength, which is the firſt thing that is commaunded me in this commaundement? If I haue done it, then haue I loued thy worde and euery way made that account of it that I ought. For Dauid thy déere ſeruaunt loued 
                  •
               hée, and beholde what he ſaith, Thy worde vnto mee was ſweeter than the 
                     •
                  onie and the honie combe. Ieremy

                  im, and hee did eate them, and they were vnto him the ioy and the reioyſing of his heart. And a number moe ſuch 
                  •
               xamples haue we, whereby we learne 
                  •
               hat there is no true loue of thée in vs, 
                  •
               nleſſe there be ioyned thereunto a ſyncere

and feruent liking of thy worde. Now foraſmuch as I am guiltie to my ſelfe, that I haue not had that care of thy worde, that I ought, to reade it, to heare it, to learne and ſéeke it, and euery way to ſhewe my loue toward it, therefore O deare Father, to ſay I haue loued thée as I ought, with all my ſoule and power, alas I dare not, alas I cannot. For much more occupied might I haue béene in the meditation of thy Lawe, than euer I haue béene. I confeſſe it O Lorde, I confeſſe it euen with griefe of heart. And therefore if thou werſt not a God moſt mercifull, I euen for this one thing were a wretche moſt miſerable. The like might I ſay of that light and little account that I haue made of thy Miniſters, which béeing another braunche of the loue of thée bewrayeth my want vnto mee. But ſée yet further howe greatly my heart hath fayled in louing of thée. For looking vnto my ſelfe a litle déeper, beholde euen ſuch thinges as flatlie

and directly are contrarie to the loue of thée, alas I ſée them to haue béene, and to be, at times in mee moſt horrible. To murmure and grudge, to repine and be offended with any croſſe or griefe whatſoeuer laide vpon mee by thée, or not euen willinglie to accept it as the meſſenger of a gratious friende, to ſeeke any wicked meanes to bee eaſed of it, is contrarie to that loue that wee owe to thée. And howe fraile my ſelfe haue béene herein, thou ſearcher of hearts knoweſt it well, and I wretche moſt weake, with ruing heart beſéeche thy pardon. Againe to ſuffer the worlde, or any gliſtering glorie thereof, further to creepe into our heartes and to tickle vs with delight and liking, than it ought, is a thing 
                  ••
               at contrarie to the loue of thée. For ſo we reade:
                  1. Iohn. 2.
                
               Loue not this worlde nor any thing that is in the worlde. For, If any man loue this world, the loue of the father is not in him. To drawe backe alſo my helping hand from thoſe

that are in néede, and not with readie heart and willing minde to comfort their poore eſtate, with whom thou haſt dealt more hardely than with mee, I knowe it bewrayeth a want of loue to thée.
                  1. Ioh. 3.17.
                For ſo I learne, Whoſoeuer hath this worldes good, ſeeth his brother neede, &amp; ſhutteth his compaſſion from him, howe dwelleth the loue of God in him? But theſe O Lord haue taynted ſomtimes this heart of mine, and therefore I haue not loued thée as I ought. But what ſhould I ſay when I viewe in my ſelfe, howe my fleſh and my heart runneth backe as it were to hide it ſelfe when I thinke of any perſecution to be abidden for thée and thy trueth, and ſpecially when I looke vpon theſe horrible torments, that ſome of thy Martirs haue ſuffered, oh what want of loue bewrayeth it to me? My houſhold and familie, my children and charge, my life and preſent eſtate ſteppe in vnto mee, as Peter once did to his maſter,

               Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen image, nor the likeneſſe of any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath, &amp;c.
            
            
               FIrſt for the order of this Commaundement, eyther wee may anſwere that this firſt Table contayning the honour and duetie of men to the Lorde, as the ſe

                  •
               ing in the former Commaundement

laide downe the former kinde, to wit of inward worſhip, fitly now in this, &amp; the two next folow ye outward duties, which to the ſame our gratious God we iuſtly owe. Or elſe thus: That the Lorde in the firſt commaundement hauing ſeparated himſelfe from al other gods, deuiſed and made by men, and commanded all mortall men and women his creatures ſubiect to his Lawe to worſhip him onely and none but him, here now in this ſecond precept (as order required) he ſetteth downe modum &amp; rationē iuxta quam coli velit, the waie and maner how he wilbee ſerued:
                Foraſmuch as in vaine he ſhould haue doone the firſt, except he had done the ſecond alſo. The way and maner is this, euen according to his will and nature. Which albeit it may ſéeme to fleſh and bloud not ſo fitlie done by a negatiue lawe, as by an affirmatiue it might, yet beſides that we are not to teache the Lorde, euen in ſpeciall wiſedome hath he thus doone it. For firſt our natures are very prone to the breache hereof, which by a

negatiue is ſtronglier beat downe than by an affirmatiue, and then againe the Gentiles next neighbours to the Iewes were very much giuen to idols and images, and therefore by name forbidden to the Iewes, leaſt by the Gentiles in that point they ſhould be defiled. And yet doth not the Lord here ſo ſet downe a negatiue, but that he includeth an affirmatiue in it. For as he ſaith, Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen image, and meaneth thereby, Thou ſhalt not worſhip mee with any deuiſe of 
                  •
               hine owne, contrary to my wil and na
               
                  •
               ure, ſo implieth he herein the affirma
               
                  •
               iue, namely thou ſhalt in euery re
               
                  •
               pect worſhip me according to my will 
                  •
               nd nature. Moreouer remember here 
                  •

                  〈◊〉
                name that thing, the doing whereof 
                  〈◊〉

                  〈◊〉
                his Maieſtie, hee ſetteth downe in

name that which is moſt vnſéemely and vile, to wit, Idolatrie. For of all wrong worſhippe, to make him like a man or woman, or other worſe creature, to proſtrate our ſelues thereunto, and to thinke wee worſhip him in ſo dooing, is moſt horrible. What expoſitions your Booke giueth you may looke and marke, adding for more plainneſſe thereunto thus much, that the very meaning of this commandement in effect is thus much: as if the Lorde ſhould haue ſaid: although the corrupt nature of man bee ſuch, as naturally he deſireth my preſence in ſome viſible forme and ſhape, fooliſhly thinking that then he is moſt neare vnto mee when he hath before his eyes ſome viſible picture of mee: yet for as much as this, and the worſhip hereby doone vnto mee is neither agréeable to my will nor nature, I therefore commaund thée that thou make to thy ſelfe no grauen image, &amp;c. That is, that thou goe not about to repreſent me by any likeneſſe of any creature whatſoeuer,

neither to worſhip mée in or vnder any ſuch ſhowes, or after any way than out of my worde thou learneſt to bee agréeable both to my will and nature. Eaſilie then may we ſée what wee are occaſioned here in this commandement to conſider of, namely,

                  
                     1 The making of Images.
                  
                  
                     2 The worſhipping of them.
                  
                  
                     3 The reaſons God vſeth here.
                  
               
            
            Touching the firſt then vſually vppon this occaſion is mooued this queſtion, whether ſimplie it bee vnlawfull and miſliked of the Lorde to make any kinde of Image by painting, car

               n of them. Whoſe money they ſay

hath neuer any image vpon it but certain Arabike letters, their other works as carpets, couerings, quiſſhins &amp;c. vtterly alſo without any image of man or any liuing creature vpon them, and all becauſe they thinke it vnlawful.
            Others thinke it lawful to make any picture at all, yea euen of God himſelfe, ſo that the ſame be not worſhipped as a bare picture &amp; image. And they vnderſtand this commaundement of images made to this ende to be adored. Theſe are our Papiſts.
            The thirde iudgement and beſt, is of them that thinke it lawful to make pictures of things which we haue ſéene to a ciuill vſe, but not to vſe them in the Church and for religion.
            Now for the firſt opinion, it is out of all queſtion falſe and too ſuperſtitious. For howſoeuer the Turks receiue not ſuch profe, yet we that imbrace &amp; cleaue to the authoritie of Gods worde, know that the Lorde hath not lefte this commaundement neither any other without large and plaine expoſition in other

places of the ſcripture, and therfore we are to conferre place with place, practiſe with precept, and ſo to ſée whether in déede all images be forbidden to be made or no. Firſt then marke ye wordes in Leuiticus:
               
                  Leuit. 26.1.
                
               Ye ſhall make you no Idols nor grauen Image, neither reare you vp any pillers &amp;c. Out of which place thus I reaſon. Looke how the Lorde forbiddeth the rearing vp of a piller, &amp; ſo doth he forbid the making of images, for he ioyneth them here in one prohibition: but he doth not ſimply forbid &amp; in all reſpects the rearing vp of a piller, therfore neither the other. The ſeconde propoſition is prooued thus:
                  Gen. 28.18.
                
               Iacob pitched the ſtone on ende that had lien vnder his heade all night, powred oyle on it, and calleth it Beth-el, the houſe of God.
                  Ioſue. 2▪
                  
                
               Ioſua commaunded by the commaundement of God twelue ſtones to be pitched vp. Samuel pitched vp a ſtone alſo betwixt Miſpeh and Sheu,
               
                  2. Sam. 7.12.
                and called the name thereof Ebenezer. Therefore not the rearing vp of a piller, but the rearing vp of it to be worſhipped idolatrouſly

was forbidden. Euen ſo of images. For, as I ſayde, they are ioyned of GOD in the place of Leuiticus as thinges like equally forbidden. A moſt notable place alſo for the proofe hereof is that in Ioſua, where the Iſraelites woulde haue warred vpon their brethren,
                  Ioſua. 22.
                if they had erected that altar for religion, which in déede they did ſet vp for a ciuill vſe, as there you may ſée. Beſides all this, doe wee not ſée that GOD himſelfe commaunded the Cherubims, Lillies, Pomgranetes, Oxen, Lyons, and ſuch like pictures to bee made, and ſayth he had giuen his Spirite to Bezaliel,
               
                  Exod. 25.
                whereby he might haue vnderſtanding to worke all theſe workes. Nowe thinke with your ſelfe, would GOD eyther haue commaunded images to be made, or aſcribed the abilitie to doe ſuch woorkes to the grace of his Spirite, if in this commaundement giuen and publiſhed before the time he had ſimplie forbidden the ſame in all reſpectes? It can not be, vnleſſe

GOD ſhould be contrarie to him ſelfe, and therefore the Turkes, or whoſoeuer elſe ſo thinkes, are deceiued. The ſame might yet further be prooued by the commaundement of GOD to make the Braſen Serpent, and by Chriſtes not finding fault with Caeſars image vpon the money that was ſhewed him, and many proofes moe if néede were. For the ſeconde opinion of them that thinke it lawfull to make any picture, yea euen of GOD himſelfe, and to ſet them vp in Churches, ſo long as no worſhip is doone to them as they are bare images, there is great cauſe why they ſhould be gaineſaid and reſiſted euen in both. But eſpecially in the firſt, for they oppoſe themſelues to the true ſenſe of this commaundement, to diuerſe other plaine Scriptures, to the nature of God, to reaſon, and to the iudgementes and practiſe of godlie men, as by particular viewe of euery one appeareth.
                  The ſenſe of the commandement againſt it.
                For touching the true and direct ende of this commandement, it hath béene ſaid

before, and is moſt true, that it is chiefly to forbid al pictures of God, as the moſt groſſe blindeneſſe and impietie of all other, bicauſe he may not be imagined to be like either man or woman, or any other creature.
                  Other Scriptures.
                He neuer was ſéene, and therefore can not be painted or pictured like any creature,
                  Deutro. 4.15. Eſa. 40.18. Acts. 17.29.
                but with a breach of this commaundement. For other places of the ſcripture plainly forbidding the ſame, I haue quoted them before, &amp; nothing can bee more expreſſe. Thirdly they oppoſe thēſelues to his nature,
                  Nature againſt it.
                which is ſuch as no heauenly creature can reſemble, much leſſe any earthly: no natural thing, much leſſe any artificial. And to ſet vp a picture of God not like him, whether it be to offende him, and to diſhonor him, if otherwiſe we cannot conceiue it, let vs iudge by our ſelues, who quickly woulde take it in great ſnuffe, if one picturing vs ſhould make either the eies too great, the noſe too long or high, the eares, mouth, armes, hands, or any thing wrong. Yea, we would burſt it in pieces, bid away with it, and

not abyde the ſight of it. Yet dare we abuſe the God of heauen our creator and maker, and ſet vp 20. thouſande pictures of him in ſeuerall places, neuer awhit like him, for it is vnpoſſible they ſhould be, neither one like another. O Chriſt open our eyes, that we may ſée this vanitie and the ſinne of that church, that maintaineth this as good. For truely it is fearefull thus to play with the Lord, whom neuer eyes ſawe, nor can ſee, as he is in nature and be

               ng. Fourthly, they do againſt al reaſon: for God is a ſpirite,
                  Reaſon againſt it.
                and therefore 
                  •
               annot be pictured: God is infinite and 
                  •
               herefore cannot be pictured. God, as often hath beene ſaide, was neuer yet 
                  •
               éene of any, and then how is it poſſible 
                  •
               o picture him? Youth and age, length, 
                  •

                  •

                  ••
               cident to the Godhead, and therefore 
                  •
               mpoſſible in verie reaſon to picture God. Laſt of all, they oppoſe them
               
                  •
               elues both to the iudgement and prac
               
                  •
               iſe of the Godly in thus doing.
                  All practiſe of the godlie againſt it.
                For to

omit the iudgements of the Prophetes and Apoſtles ſo lately quoted, crying againſt this impietie. It is verie worthie noting that the auncient Father Damaſcene a defender of other images and pictures greatly, yet ſaith: Deum conarivelle effingere,
               
                  Lib. 4. cap. 8.
                
               rem ſtultam eſſe &amp; impiam. non enim imagines Deus admittit. To goe about
                (ſaith he) to picture God is both a verie fooliſh thing and a wicked. For God may not be pictured. And if you marke the practiſe of the godlie, I pray you of all thoſe notable viſions and manifeſtations made vnto them, which of them euer went about to make a picture? Surely if they would not euer preſume to picture God in that manner that they ſawe him and talked with him, becauſe they well knewe theſe were but ſparcles as it were of his glorie and maieſtie that they ſawe, and hee in nature a farre other thin
                  •
                than euer he appeared vnto them or they able to beholde, if he had doone it, howe ſhall we beholde, nay O Lorde what blindeneſſe is it in vs to ſet him

out as we liſt our ſelues, and euen as euerie ſinnefull man and rude painter pleaſeth? Therefore I truſt we ſée this to be a fault, and euen forbidden in this ſeconde commaundement, to make any image of God himſelfe.
            The thirde opinion of them that thinke there is a lawfull vſe of ſome Images and pictures, though not in re

act of Ioſua, who ſet a ſtone in the ſanctuarie of God, and by the déede of Salomon, who had the pictures of dyuers things in the temple, and of the Cherubins in the holyeſt place of al, yet certainly in this matter, it is not ſo good to looke what may be doone, as what is conuenient to be doone. For if in any thing, ſurely in this it is true, ſome thing is in ſome ſort lawfull, which is not expedient. Images in Churches we well know, haue not euer béene vſed, howſoeuer Rome doth vrge the matter, but then began, when as the idols of the Gentiles being deſtroyed and peace reſtored to the Churches vnder Conſtantine, they vſed with great affection and reſort in certaine places and times to ſolemniſe the memorie of ſuch godly Martyrs as conſtantly for the truth had ſuffered: Setting vp in their Churches at theſe their ſolemne méetings for ornaments partly, &amp; partly for a better remembrance of their conſtanty &amp; faith, the pictures and images of ſuch dead Martyrs, as

eſpecially they iudged woorthie chiefe remembraunce, and this began not to be any cuſtome til about the yere of our Lorde 380, as by much authoritie is eaſily and euidentlie to be prooued.
                  Ann. 380.
                And yet ſée and note it diligently which indéede is to be marked of vs al, albeit the beginning of images in Churches was for no worſe ende than I now haue named, yet did the godly Fathers in thoſe dayes euen vehemently ſpeake againſt the ſame, not condemning in it ſelfe the hiſtoricall vſe of pictures, but yet wiſhing in ſuch places of méeting to ſerue GOD, as the Churches were, rather priſtinam &amp; primitiuam ſimplicit atem, the olde and primitiue ſimplicitie, than ſuch deckinges and ornamentes of images. Iuſtly fearing the miſchiefe, that indéede followed of it, and nowe ſo greatly aboundeth in ye Church of Rome to wit groſſe impietie and idolatrie. Therfore I ſay againe, howſoeuer in it ſelfe any men thinke it to be lawfull with ſome conditions, yet certainely it is no way conuenient, but verie

daungerous euery way to haue them in the Churches. This firſt point then of this commaundement is nowe ſufficiently explaned vnto vs, if one worde be added of the very firſt beginning of Images,
                  The originall of Images.
                and to what end they were inuented. Reade the fourtéenth Chapter of the booke of Wiſedome, and marke the ſtorie well. The inuenting of idols, ſaith he, was the beginning of whoredome, and the finding of them is the corruption of life. They were not from the beginning, neither ſhall they continue for euer, &amp;c. Before the floud we reade not of them in the ſcriptures. And after the floud about 300. yeares liued Terah, Abrahams father, who as he was the firſt idolater that we reade of, ſo thinketh Epiphanius he was the firſt maker of an image, and euen hee that is meant in the 14. of Wiſedome before named. But whoſoeuer firſt inuented them, and whenſoeuer they firſt began, it ſkilleth not much, only note his iudgement that writ that booke of Wiſdome, whoſoeuer he was, how he plain

                image, and the thing repreſented 
                  ••
               ereby. But what is it then that they

ſay for the maintenaunce of their images, if they denie to woorſhip them?
            
                Forſooth firſt they ſay they worſhip not the image, but God in the image, and vnder the image.
                  Popiſh ſhiftes.
                But where alas haue they their warraunt, that GOD will be thus woorſhipped of them, and that whatſoeuer they doe in outward ſhewe to the image, he will repute it and take it as doone in heart to himſelfe? What we haue to ſay againſt this vaine deuiſe of theirs, I pray you marke. Firſt the very Gentiles had the ſelfſame excuſe &amp; ſhift for their idolatry, and yet was their doing wicked. Arnobius ſaith of them, Non adorabant ſtatua
                     •
                   quòd putabant,
               
                  Lib. 6.
                
               aes, aurum, argentū aut ſimiles ſtatuarū materias Deos eſſe, ſed quòd per ea dij inuiſibiles honorentur. That is, They woorſhipped images, not for that they thought, braſſe, golde, ſiluer, or ſuch things to be God, but becauſe by thoſ
                     •
                   things the inuiſible gods were worſhipped.
            
            
                Secondly if we looke to the ſcripture we reade a complaint in the book of Iudges,
               
for that the people left the God of Iſraell, and ſerued Baalim,
               
                  Iud. 2.11.
                and what I pray you was that? Did they thinke that image to be God? No ſaieth the prophet Oſee, They haue called me Baalim, meaning God, that is,
                  Oſee. 2.16.
                they thought that worſhip which they did to Baalim, was doone to God vnder the image, and by the image, and yet ſaith the worde, They did euill in ſeruing Baalim.
               
                  Iud. 2.11.
                What can be plainer againſt this idle excuſe, if you will looke and mark the places wel? Againe in the 17. of Iudges we reade of Micah his idols in the forme of men,
                  Iud. 17.
                as ſome thinke, becauſe Chriſt appeared diuerſe times like a man. And what?
                  Gen 32. Dan. 7.
                did he thinke thoſe his idols to be God, or worſhip thē as gods? no his own words teſtifie the contrary, for he ſaith, Nowe ſhall the Lord bleſſe me, when I haue a Leuite to my prieſt: he doeth not ſay, Nowe ſhall my Teraphim bleſſe me, but nowe ſhall the Lorde bleſſe me, diſtinguiſhing betwixt God and his images. So that Micah did not thinke his idols 
                  •
               o be GOD, and ſo certainelie did

not worſhip them as God, but in them rather and by them thought he ſerued God who accepted that to himſelfe, that was doone to the image which repreſ
                  •
               nted him, yet did he wickedly and ſinned like an idolater in ſo doing. Howe then ſhould this popiſh excuſe be good of worſhipping GOD in the image? I would to GOD with modeſtie and Chriſtian chaſtitie men and women would thinke of this reaſon drawen by a godly man à pari, of the like. Would the huſband be content with his wife, or the wife with the huſband, if that duetie which is due of them one toward the other, ſhould be perfourmed of eyther of them to a ſtraunger with this excuſe that the Papiſts make? No we knowe we could not beare it, neyther would we with any ſuch aunſwere be contented. And why ſhould our hearts be ſo hard, and our iudgements ſo bewitched, that we ſhould not thinke the Lord loueth his Church, and euery true member of it, aſwell as any man his wife, or any wife her huſband, and is as

ielous of that ſpirituall duetie, that is due to him, as men are of the other? The one is actuall fornication, the other is ſpirituall ſo learned euē in wiſedome of God to beate into vs that hee can as ill abide the one, as wee the other: and yet wee will not ſée, nor conceiue. Againe ſhall we thinke that the Iſraelites were ſo groſſe, as to thinke the golden Calfe to bee a verie God, when as they knewe it molten and made of ye earings that they plucked off? Truely it is impoſſible. For they knew that had a beginning, and a God there was who had doone great things for them ere that day, whoſe beginning they knewe not: How then? Why, out of queſtiō they did imagine, that the worſhip which they did to that idoll, was doone to God in the idoll. And yet whether God was pleaſed with that excuſe or no, iudge we all. Let it fall then euen in the feare of God, what mans head inuenteth againſt the Lord and his owne duetie, and at the laſt let vs ſée it to bée a vaine mocke, to thinke wee can worſhip

God in an image, and by it, or vnder it.
            Another ſhifte they haue for defence of images in the Church, but it is as ill as the former. They are (ſay they) lay mens Bookes, and ſtande in verie good ſtéede, to put vs in minde of GOD. It is verie well. And is euery kinde of Booke then good and to bee allowed of? Or is euerie manner of rememberaunce by and by commendable? If not, then ſhould they not onely ſay they are laye mens Bookes, but proue that they are good bookes alſo in déede to that ende. (for otherwiſe many bookes may aſwell hurt as profit the vſers of them as I ſaid.) But this they doe not, neither in déede can they doe, and therefore the conſequence they make is naught, and falleth of it ſelfe if you marke it. Nowe that they are no good Bookes, but verie daungerous and deceyuing ſightes for laye men or other whatſoeuer, let the worde of the Lorde himſelfe bee iudge.
                  Iere. 10.8.
                The Prophet Ieremie in zeale of ſpirite deteſteth

ſuch Bookes,
                  verſe. 15.
                and refuſeth to bee put in mynde of GOD by any ſuch deceitefull meanes. For the ſtocke ſayeth hée, is a doctrine of vanitie, yea they are vanitie and the worke of errours, and in the time of their viſitation they ſhall periſhe. The Prophet Abacuck agayne ſayth, That the image is a teacher of lyes,
               
                  Chap. 2.18.
                
               though hee that made it, truſt in it, &amp;c. Shall then a Booke full of lyes, vanities, and errour bée ſo good a Booke, and rememberaunce to laye men? Shall that which indaungereth the learned, nothing hurt thinke wee the vnlearned? O that wee knewe not by experience into what fonde and wicked opinions poore people haue béene brought of GOD by theſe painted and carued Bookes? Howe many heartes lament their follie, and howe many tongues to the praiſe of GODS mercy in viſiting them with his light, can, and doe tell, what fonde conceytes they had of the Lorde and heauenly matters, ſeduced by the ſight of their eyes?

Therefore ſince God hath ſaide it, and experience founde it, that they are ſo daungerous, let them be Bookes for Paganes and Heathens, ſurely for Chriſtians they ſhould not bee. Which of the Prophetes or Apoſtles went about euer to haue images made, either to put themſelues in minde of any thing which the Lorde taught them, or their people of any thing which they deliuered to them from the Lorde? But they vſed the admonition of their brethren, and eſpecially by writing downe what they taught they helped this infirmitie of ours. Signifying euen by that their practiſe what the meanes ought nowe to bee to put vs in minde of God and heauenly things, chiefely his worde. The Lorde himſelfe ſaieth,
                  Deutro. 4.
                
               Ye ſawe no image, but heard a voyce onely. Therefore make no image: and againe, You ſawe that I ſpake to you from heauen, therefore yee ſhall make no Gods of golde nor ſiluer: as if he ſhoulde haue ſaide, my practiſe in ſpeaking to you by voyce, not by image, ſhoulde teach you

that by my worde and not by image, I am to be remembred. And it is a notable place in Eſay,
               
                  Eſay. 30.21.
                that when the worde ſhall take place with his, then they ſhal abhorre images. And thus much both of making them, and worſhipping them.
            Next it doeth followe, that wee conſider howe vnder this outward appearing groſſe idolatrie, are compriſed all deuiſed wayes &amp; meanes of our ſelues to ſerue the Lord, yea, euen all, be they neuer ſo glorious in our eyes, and our intentes neuer ſo good and godly &amp; reaſonable, as we thinke, yet if they be but our owne inuentions, not warranted to vs in the word, here vnder this name of images they are contained, and together condemned. So that the very ſenſe of this commandement is this,
                  Generally by no deuiſe of man, and particularly not by this.
                as hath before béene ſaide: by no deuiſe of thine owne, or inuention whatſoeuer will I bee ſerued, and namely not by images erected vp to me, or in rememberaunce of mee. But euer at all times, and of all men according to that rule that my

ſelfe haue laide downe, and preſcribed onely.
                  Deutr. 12. Eſay. 29.
                
               You ſhall not doe euerie man what ſeemeth good in his owne eyes, for in vaine doe men worſhippe mee with traditions of men. Moſes did nothing in building the materiall tabernacle beſide what was commaunded and ſhewed him. Nadab and Abihu the ſonnes of Aaron dyed for preſuming of themſelues to ſerue the Lorde with ſtraunge fire.
                  Leuit. 10.
                The verie heathniſh Romanes had this reaſon with them, that it was better for them to bée quite without Chriſt, than to worſhip him, and others with him againſt his will and liking. And ad placandum deum ijs opus habent homines quae ille iubet, that is, To pleaſe the Lorde, ſaith Lactantius, men haue neede of thoſe things that he himſelfe commaundeth. And a Chriſtian minde doeth not finde a ſure ſtay, but when it heareth, Hoc dicit dominus:
               
                  1. Sam. 13.
                
               This ſaieth the Lorde. If Saul breake ye courſe that God doeth appoint and of himſelf deuiſe to ſerue the Lord, be his neceſſitie to doe ſo, as he thinketh

neuer ſo great, and the intent of his heart neuer ſo holie like, certainelie Samuel both muſt, and will tell him to his face, he hath doone fooliſhly,
                  1. Sam. 15.
                for the Lord hath more pleaſure in that his will is obeyed, than in all the fatlings of the Amalekites offered vp vnto him of our owne wils and heades. Intents will not ſerue, neither voluntarie Religion ſtande accepted. And therefore euer let vs weigh and followe the counſell of Salomon. And looke to our feete, when wee enter into the houſe of God being more readie to heare,
               
                  Eccleſi. 4.
                
               than to offer the ſacrifice of fooles, for they knowe not what they doe.
            
            Laſt of all we are to conſider the reaſons that God maketh here.
                  The reaſons of this commandement.
                The firſt is drawen of his loue towardes vs, yea of his exceeding great loue, which is euen growen to a ielouſie. So déerelie, ſo vehemently is his heart ſet vppon vs, yet not for any woorthineſſe in vs, that looke howe grieuouſly a ielous man can take the miſbehauiour of his

ſtraying wife, euen ſo ill can the Lorde abyde that wee ſhoulde impart our ſelues to others beſide him in obediēce, worſhip and loue. Nowe had we any féeling left within our ſides, and our heartes were not altogether ſo harde trampled and beaten as they are, what a reaſon were this for euer to kéepe vs knit vnto the Lorde?
                  O marke.
                Why ſhoulde he loue vs, why ſhould he care for vs, why ſhoulde he thinke of vs, or euer once vouchſafe vs good, who of our ſelues cannot thinke a good thought? There is no cauſe but in himſelfe. Yet doth he not onely loue vs, but is ielous of vs. How then ſhould this force vs to cleaue vnto him, onely his, &amp; none but his for euermore? Is he ours and will we not be his againe? Would he onely enioy vs, and wee will not be tyed vnto him? Take héede. The greater loue, the greater hate, when vnkinde refuſall is to reape his iuſt rewarde. The ſeconde reaſon which the Lorde here vſeth is drawen of the puniſhment that will light vpon vs, if wee breake this commandement.

He will viſite the ſinnes of the fathers vppon the children vnto the thirde and fourth generation, &amp; ſore is that anger, the flame of whoſe puniſhment caſteth out ſmoke ſo farre, yet the meaning thereof is, as Ezekiel well ſhowes,
                  Chap. 18.
                if the children doe follow the fathers wickedneſſe, and not otherwiſe.  The thirde reaſon is drawen of his mercie promiſed here euē to thouſands of them that loue him &amp; kéepe his commandements. O now that we would weigh theſe reaſons well and lay them déepe vp in our hearts. Truely if there bee any portion of the ſpirit of life in vs, we ſhould finde them forcible to giue vs a taſte of the wrath of God againſt idolatrie, and approching before him with our owne inuentions, what excuſes, intents &amp; reaſons ſoeuer wee thinke we haue for the ſame, we ſhall finde them ſtrong to allure vs to the carefull and diligent ſéeking of the Lords wil out of his word, and the duetifull and conſtant ſeruing of him according to that rule. But when wee will not weigh his promiſed mercies,

nor giue our heartes leaue to thinke of his threatened iudgementes, but headlong in vnféelingneſſe runne on, and in blinde ignoraunce imagine, that our intentes if they bee good muſt néedes ſtoppe Gods mouth and make him contented with the breache of his will, this, this is the poyſon of ye whore of Babylon that infecteth our ſoules to eternall damnation and wrathe. O God &amp; Father of mercies diſperſe this dimneſſe as may ſtande with thy goodwill from the eyes of thy deceiued creatures, and yet once ere they dye, let them ſée their ſinnes againſt this commaundement, that in wrath they paſſe not to greater iudgement, ſo due and ſo ſure to all wilfull contemners of the light of thy worde and Goſpell. Amen. Furthermore againe if wee doe well, marke here the wordes of our God wherewith he vttereth theſe promiſes &amp; threateneth theſe iudgementes, truely they aforde vnto vs two or thrée profitable notes, and conſiderations. As firſt, becauſe in our deuiſes &amp; worſhip

of our owne will the beſt wee can ſay, is that it commeth from a good meaning and intent, and therefore wée thinke God cannot of his mercie refuſe that which is well meant, and intended towardes him: I beſeeche you marke howe the Lord here ouerthroweth vtterly this defence, ſaying in expreſſe wordes, that they bee haters of him and ſo led with the liking of their worſhippe from the Lorde and his true ſeruice, that when occaſion ſerueth they bewraye extreme hatred thereunto, perſecuting it with fire and fagotte in the true profeſſours thereof. O my brethren if GOD repute mee for an enemie, what can my pretended loue auayle mee? If hée ſay I hate him, howe dare I ſtill bewitched with my follie, thinke I loue him? Shall his owne mouth tell mee, that I hate him, and that he ſo taketh all my doings,
                  If I ſwarue frō Gods commandements. I hate him intend what I can.
                &amp; will I not beléeue it? is it not poſſible to make vs féele our fault, and to ſée our ſinne in this behalfe? will wee ſtill chalenge the Lorde

with our good intentes and honeſt meanings, as wee thinke, when yet his owne tongue ſpeaketh it, that if I eyther ſerue with him any other, as ſaints, Angels, images, or whatſoeuer, or him alone after any other way, than he preſcribeth, I loue him not, but hate him, yea euen extremely hate him, and ſhall at his handes finde the rewarde of a deadly enemie to his glorie? Nowe Chriſt for his mercies ſake touche vs and giue vs féeling. Secondly let vs marke againe in theſe the compariſon of mercy and iudgement together, how farre the one excéedeth. His enemies and haters of his will he puniſheth but to the thirde and fourth generation, but ſheweth mercie to thouſandes of them that loue him and kéepe his commaundementes: Who woulde not ſerue then, and onely ſerue a God of ſuch a nature? Yea what heart is it that will not ſéeke to pleaſe according to his will ſo good a Lorde as powreth mercie ſo long after his deceaſe vppon his ofſpring and poſteritie?
            
               Laſt of all, it is verie worthie obſeruation, howe that ſpeaking here of his commandements, he placeth loue before it, ſaying he will ſhewe kindneſſe to thouſandes of them that loue him, and kéepe his commandements. As though he woulde haue vs knowe that theſe two cannot be ſeparated, but whoſoeuer frameth himſelfe to obey the Lorde, he muſt néedes loue him before, for out of that, as out of his fountaine and proper head, floweth the other, not accepted elſe nor liked of if it doe not, and contrariwiſe if wee doe loue the Lorde in déede, in trueth, in veritie, then will wee keepe His Commaundementes, marke it, His Commaundementes, he doeth not ſay then will hee deuiſe this thing, and that thing, with twentie things moe of a good minde and meaning to pleaſe GOD withall, but we will then kéepe His Commandements, that is, wee will then ſéeke and ſearch, wee will then reade and heare euerie man, wee will endeuour to bee inſtructed what GOD in his worde

hath preſcribed vs to doe and wee will kéepe His commaundementes. Nowe then once againe, euen as the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt is deare vnto vs, let our brethren of the Churche of Rome, (for ſo wee yet call them in hope of amendment) looke and marke what loue of GOD is in them. Héere is a note, and elſe often repeated in the Scripture to knowe their loue by. Alas they deuiſe lawes, wayes, and meanes, euerie day to ſerue GOD withall of their owne heades, but his preſcribed rule in his worde they vtterly contemne and neglect. Now where true loue of GOD is, out of it floweth a burning conſtant care to kéepe His commaundementes, not our owne. They kéepe their owne and with fire and fagot doe reuenge the breach of them, but the Lordes worde not ſo, with abſtayning from this meate and that meate, this day and that day, with ſingle lyfe, though moſt impure, with prayers in an vnknowen tongue, and thus often repeated

ouer and ouer, with croſſings, and créepings, Paxes and Beades, holie water and Creame, Aſhes and ſpittle, with a thouſande ſuch things haue they deuiſed to worſhippe the Lorde, and who ſo breaketh theſe, an Heretike hée is, a runneaway from the Church, cite him and ſummon him, excommunicate him and impriſon him, burne him and hang him, yea away with ſuch a one, for he is not worthie to liue vpon the earth. But if he blaſpheme the name of the Lord by horrible ſwearing,
                  Reade the L. Cobhams laſt examination in the beginning of it.
                if he offende moſt grieuouſly in pride, in wrath, in gluttonie, and couetouſneſſe, if he be a drunken aleſtake, a ticktack tauerner, kéepe a whore or two in his owne houſe, and moe abroade at bord with other men, with a nūber ſuch like gréeuous offences, what doe they? Either he is not puniſhed at all, &amp; moſt commonly ſo or if he be, it is a little penance of their owne inuenting by belly or purſe, or to ſay a certaine of prayers, to viſit ſuch an image in pilgrimage, &amp;c.
            But all this deſerueth neither fire nor

fagot. Is not this for that man of ſinne to exalt himſelfe againſt all that is called God, or that is worſhipped? Can it be denied but that he that puniſheth the breache of his owne lawes aboue the breache of Gods lawes, in that preferreth himſelfe before GOD? Surely it cannot, it is too plaine, &amp; therefore once againe remember that the loue of God in man or woman draweth them to the kéeping of His commandements ſet downe in the worde, and not of their owne conſtitutions deuiſed by themſelues. And thus much in briefe of this commandement.
            
               The examination of the conſcience.
               Nowe if I woulde fruitefully meditate and thinke of this commandement ſecretely, and ſhortly with my ſelfe, as I did of the former, then conſider I, that as in other ſo in this alſo, little is ſaid, and much is meant, part is put for the whole, and in the negatiue the affirmatiue

is implyed. Therefore thus doe I take the commaundement, as if it were ſaide, Thou ſhalt not worſhip me with any carnall, earthly, ſuperſtitious or outward deuiſed worſhip by thy ſelfe, &amp; namely not by images, but in heart, in ſpirite, in truth, as is commaunded in my worde. Which when I knowe, if I would at any time rip vp this heart of mine, and diſcloſe vnto my ſelfe my ſecrete guilt and ſinne herein againſt my God, I carefully conſider, and as I can in minde beholde, howe I haue euer ſerued the Lorde, or thought in iudgement that he might be ſerued. And peraduenture I finde, that liuing in the daies of ſuperſtition and blindneſſe, ignorant of God and his truth, for feare &amp; weakeneſſe with others, I haue bowed my knée to Baall, worſhipped ſtockes and ſtones, or as I thought GOD in them, &amp; euen béene polluted with groſſe and grieuous idolatrie. For which if it ſo haue béene, what can I ſay? Shall ignoraunce excuſe mée? Did I labour then and euer by all meanes poſſible to attaine

to knowledge? Or liued I rather careleſly as others did, thinking it good that many followed, and hauing or ſéeking no better grounde for my conſcience, than the practiſe of my forefathers, kings and gouernours? If of this latter my heart condemne me, how ſhould my ignorance excuſe me, ſince it was ſo plainely wilfull? Shall good intent or my good meaning ſtand for warrant before my God? Ah howe ſhall he that gaue me in charge expreſſelie, that I ſhould not doe what ſéemeth good in mine owne eyes, but what he commanded, accept for excuſe my wilfull and ſtubborne diſobedience? Neyther ignoraunce therefore nor intent may warraunt ſo witles walking before the Lorde, but onely pardon in Chriſt Ieſus my Sauiour. But if eyther age, which then was young, or other prouidence of the Lorde haue freed mee alwayes from ſo groſſe idolatrie, yet ſéeke I further whether with any outwarde thing elſe whatſoeuer, not warraunted by the word, I haue thought or ſought

to ſerue and pleaſe the Lorde, being by reaſon thereof, brought aſléepe with an imagination of my well doing, and ſo careleſſe to ſéeke or practiſe the dueties of the word. If I haue, this alſo knowe I to be a breach of this commandement. Then from things not warraunted, I came to things commanded, as the hearing of ye word, prayer, conference profitable with my brethren, and ſuch like: knowing that if euen in theſe by the Lorde ordayned, as thinges wherewith he is honoured and pleaſed, I haue otherwiſe vſed my ſelfe, than I ſhould, in ſtead of perfourming the Lordes appointment, I haue brought before him mine owne inuention, walking vnwittingly in mine owne wayes, &amp; fearfully broken this precept of my God. Which when I conſider, I néede no further ſhewe of grieuous guilt to caſt me down from height of all ſuppoſed ſoundnes in this law. Mine eyes do ſée, my heart acknowledgeth, my conſcience crieth, my ſinne is great. Stand O ſoule before the Lord, the iuſt and vpright Iudge, whoſe

pearcing eyes diſcouereth al thy waies, ſet thy ſelfe more in his ſight, while mercie may be had, whoſe voyce ſhall ſound thy laſting woe, if ſight of ſinne procure not true remorſe. And ſay now ſoule before the Iudge of trueth, haſt thou alwayes vſed as hee hath willed thée, the hearing of the worde? Did neuer deſire of worldlie praiſe prouoke thée to this ſeruice? Neuer diddeſt thou thinke to day ſuch ſhall I ſée, and againe of them be noted if I goe? Did neuer feare of worſe opinion to be bred of thée in worldlie ſtates by thy abſence, drawe thée out? No fleſhlie thought or earthly liking of the ſpeaker hath there béene within thée to pricke thée to his hearing? Hath painted pride and newe or ſtraunge attyre neuer ſaide ſecretly in thée, to daie goe heare the Sermon? Lie thou maieſt not, the Lord being Iudge, cleare thy ſelfe thou canſt not, O my ſo
                     •
                  le thy ſelfe being iudge. Therefore yt which ye Lord appointeth as a ſeruice to himſelfe, and for our endleſſe comfort, by this corruption beginneth a ſeruice of

thine own, &amp; to thy iuſt damnation. For to heare the Lorde biddeth, but not for theſe ends. Thus ſeruing the Lord in a thing commanded, not as he commandeth, I ſerue him with mine owne inuention, and guiltie moſt grieuouſly I am before him. O that I were any better in the duetie of prayer. Am I neuer negligent, colde, and froſen? Burneth the fire within me before, or whileſt I ſpeake with my tongue? Shaketh my fleſh with the vehemencie of my ſpirite? Neuer ſtraieth my heart from preſent praier? Neuer haſt I to an ende, or wearilie wiſhe the voice, I heare to ceaſe, it is too long? Ah wretch, howe dare I ſay it? Conſcience cryeth and will not be bribed, this duetie of prayer thus corruptly perfourmed, the Lorde acknowledgeth not as a ſeruice by him commaunded, but as mine own inuention, and a breache of this his precept. My conference with others in ſhewe ſo good, in words ſo faire, taſteth it neuer of liking of my ſelfe, or vaine delight to heare mine owne diſcourſe, of

pride to ſéeme and to be knowen a man indued with ſuch and ſo good gifts? Tendeth my heart in trueth to the praiſe of my God, and the comfort of my hearers, whenſoeuer I ſpeake of fruitfull things without all vaine reſpect and hidden euill whatſoeuer? If it doe not, then the thing that in it ſelfe the Lord hath commanded, as I perfourme it, he vtterly abhorreth, and it is wilworſhippe of mine owne, not preſcribed dutie by my God: therefore a breache of this commaundement. What ſhould I ſay? The more I ſearche, the more I ſée: and I am not as I thought concerning the kéeping of this Lawe. Mo things yet in it are commaunded, and moe thinges well by theſe I ſée I haue not perfourmed. Thus much ſerueth to ſound damnation to me, and witneſſe ſufficient in dreadfull day ſhall this my guilt exhibite againſt me, beſide a curſe vpon my poſteritie to many generations. But O Lorde thy mercie reacheth vnto the heauens,

Deare father haue mercie vpon me, and burie in the bottome of the ſea, that they neuer more appeare before thée, all my ſinnes, and by name my breaches of this commandement. O my God as thou haſt vouchſafed mee a Sauiour to quit mee from this curſe, ſo due vnto me for my diſobedience, ſo in that Sauiour of mine thine owne déere ſonne looke vpon me. He was borne for my ſake, he liued for my ſake, he died for my ſake, then let his birth, his life, his death good Lord profite mée, in winning pardon of thée for my faults, and direction of thy ſpirite for the time to come, that better daily I may knowe to ſerue thée, and euen in trueth as thou haſt preſcribed, perfourme the ſame vnto thée. Amen good Lord, heare me.

Secondly that wee neuer blaſpheme the name of God by coniuring, witchcraft, ſorcerie or charming, or any ſuch like, neither hy curſing, or banning. Thirdly that we neuer ſweare by the name of God in our common talke, although the matter be neuer ſo true, but only where the glorie of God is ſought, or the ſaluation of our brethren, or before a Magiſtrate in witneſſing the trueth, when

we are thereunto lawfully called. In which cauſes we muſt onely ſweare by the name of God. But as for Saintes, Angels Roode, Booke, Croſſe, Maſſe, or anie other thing, we ought in no caſe by them to ſweare.
            
               Que. What is meant by the name of God here?

                  Philip. 2, 9.
                but alſo his maieſtie and excellencie, with ſuch attributes as declare the ſame, as his wiſedome, his iuſtice, his prouidence, his mercie and ſo foorth. Againe his lawe and commandements or his doctrine and worde are vſuallie ſignified by it,
                  Leuit. 22.31. 1. Tim. 61.
                to make vs more carefull to attende vppon them, as things wherupon depend the honour, glorie and name of God.
            
               Que. What is it to take his name in vaine?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Surelie either to ſpeake or thinke of it without moſt high reuerence, and eſpeciallie to ſweare by it otherwiſe than we ought. Alſo to caſt

behind vs the diligent care of his commaundementes.
            
               Que. Of the latter we ſhall ſpeake hereafter, nowe in the meane time how prooue you that wee muſt euerie waie vſe reuerentlie the name of God?
               
            
            
               Anſ. To name but one place of manie, it is prooued euidentlie by theſe wordes of the lawe:
                  Deut. 28.58.
                
               If thou ſhalt not feare this glorious and fearefull name, the Lorde thy GOD, then will the Lorde make thy plagues woonderfull, &amp;c. That is, if thou doeſt not with moſt great feare and reuerence vſe the name of GOD at all times, and ſhewe the ſame by kéeping and doeing all the wordes of this lawe, then will I plague thée to the example of all others, euen in thy ſelfe and in thy ſéede,
                  V. 59.
                
               with great plagues and of long continuaunce, and ſore diſeaſes and of long durance.
            
            
               Que. Howe prooue you that by ſwearing I muſt vſe his name reuerentlie?
               
            
            
               
               Anſ. By neceſſarie conſequence. For if I muſt euer vſe it reuerently, then when I ſweare by it.
            
               Que. The argument were good, if it were lawfull to ſweare at all, but the Scripture ſeemeth to denie all ſwearing,
               
               
                  Math. 5.33. Iam. 5.12.
                
               ſaying: ſweare not at all, but let your communication bee yea, yea, and nay, nay. Whereupon the Anabaptiſtes haue thought this lawe a ceremoniall lawe, and now abrogated.
            
            
               Anſ. Thoſe places you name are to bee vnderſtoode either of common talke, or of ſwearing by creatures, and they doe not in generall condemne all ſwearing. Of this iudgement is Auguſtine, who ſaith: In nouo Teſtamento dictum est ne omnino iuremus, non quia iurare eſt peccatum, ſed quia pe
                     •
                  erare eſt immane peccatum: That is, In the newe Teſtament wee are forbidden to ſweare at all, not becauſe all ſwearing is a ſinne, but becauſe forſwearing is an horrible ſinne. And in an other place, Admonitio non

iurandi, conſeruatio est a peccato periurij. The admonitiō in ſcripture not to ſweare is a preſeruation from falſe and wrongfull ſwearing.
               
            
            
               Que. Is it then lawfull to ſweare?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Yea it is both lawfull and a glorie to God.
            
               Que. Firſt howe prooue you it is lawfull?
               
            
            
               Anſ. God in his law expreſſelie commandeth vs, ſaying, Thou ſhalt feare the Lorde thy God and ſerue him,
               
                  Deut. 6.13. Chap. 10.20
                
               and ſhalt ſweare by his name: therefore it is lawfull. Secondlie GOD himſelfe and all his children (as occaſion ſerued) haue vſed to doe it, and therefore lawfull. God him ſelfe (as we reade) Becauſe hee had not a greater to ſweare by,
               
                  Heb. 6. Gen. 2. Cor. 1.23.
                
               ſware by himſelfe. And the Patriarches, Prophetes, Apoſtles did honour God with this ſeruice. We ſée it.
            
               Que. How prooue you that it is honour to God?
               
            
            
               Anſ. By the teſtimonies before cited wee euidentlie ſee,
                  Heb. 6.
                that the thing wee

ſweare by, wee make it the greateſt of all other, wee make it the witneſſe and diſcerner of our trueth wee meane,
                  2. Cor. 1.23.
                and the reuenger of falſehoode and our fault if wee doe not as wee ſweare, all which to bee giuen to the Lorde by ſwearing onely by him, is a glory to him, and contrariwiſe a diſhonour to him to aſcribe them elſewhere, ſince indéede they are not incident to anie creature.
            
               Que. But doe all ſwearers by the name of God honour God in ſo doeing?
               
            
            
               Anſ. O no, vnleſſe we ſweare as we ought, we diſhonour him greatly.
            
               Que. How is that?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Firſt the matter muſt be true, to Gods honour, and the benefite of our brother. Secondlie before a Magiſtrate when we are lawfullie called. Thirdlie the name of God muſt only be vſed, and laſtly our affection ought to bee good. The firſt is prooued by the othe that Ioſua his eſpies made to Rahab.
               
                  2. Ioſue. 12.
                Againſt which it ſhoulde bee an offence verie fearefull if men hauing the places

of Iudges, Iuſtices, &amp;c. ſhoulde miniſter othes to men in euerie light trifling cauſe for more ſpéede, becauſe they will not ſtande to ſearch and examine the matter otherwiſe, &amp; ſhould either do it themſelues, or ſit and heare their ſeruantes doe it in ſuch hudling, pooſting and vnreuerent manner, as that a man can ſcarſe tel what he ſaith. Whereas amongſt Chriſtians it were verie commendable if there were ſome pithie and godly admonition either longer or ſhorter to aduiſe them of the nature of an oth, what honor it is to God, if it be as it ought to bee, and what dreadfull woe it pulleth vpon them, if it be otherwiſe.
                  Exod. 22.10.11
                The ſeconde is prooued by the law of God prouided and ſet downe to that end. The third is prooued by ye Prophete Ieremie,
               
                  Iere. 5.7. See Amos. 8.14. Sophon. 1.4.
                by whoſe mouth the Lorde complaineth, that therefore hée was forſaken of them, becauſe they ſware by them that are no Gods. And marke it well. Is the mother of Chriſt a God? Are Peter and Paul, Saint and Angel whatſoeuer ſo many gods?

Is the Roode a God, the Maſſe a God, your faith and trueth a God, &amp;c. Is the bodie of Chriſt a God? is his bloode a God, his armes, ſides, féete, &amp; hearte ſo manie Gods? If they bee not, howe ſweare we by them then ſo vſually and ſo fearefullie? We heare what GOD ſaith by the Prophet, namely that they that ſweare by anie thing that is not God, do flatly forſake the true God him ſelfe, and will we not marke it? Shall it not feare vs from ſo foule a cuſtome? I hope it ſhall. Laſt of all, that my affection ſhold be good, verie reaſon maie aſſure me. For if I come to ſweare not for any care or loue to the glory of God, to the trueth of the cauſe, and peace and right of my neighbour, but in choler, in malice, for ſpite &amp; enuie, certainly howſoeuer my oth doth good, yet ſhall the Lorde neuer aſcribe that good to mee, but in wrath puniſhe mee for doeing a good thing with ſo euill a minde. Thus then we ſée how we muſt ſweare if God be pleaſed and honoured by vs

in that action, and how if we do otherwiſe we breake this commaundement, and take his name in vaine.
            
               Que. One queſtion by the waye let me aske you, whether may a Chriſtian admitte an oath by an Idoll hauing to deale with an Infidell, or no?
               
            
            
               Anſ. The ciuill lawe they ſay permitteth ſtraungers to ſweare by their owne Gods. Tertullian in his booke of Idolatrie ſayth, wee ought not to contende with them ouermuch about this matter. Auguſtine in an Epiſtle ſaith plainelie, it maie be admitted of a Chriſtian, and wee ſée it in the worde, that when Iacob and Laban ſware eche to other, Iacob ſware by the true God, and Laban by the God of Nachar, beſides diuers other examples.
            
               Que. Then to goe forwarde, certaine it is that wee are not onelie bounde to the affirmatiue, that is euerie way with moſt high reuerence to vſe the name of GOD, and namelie in ſwearing, but alſo to the negatiue,

no waye to pollute this name, and chiefly not in ſwearing. Hauing then heard how by others he is diſhonored, I pray you what other breach doe you knowe of this commandement beſide vngodly ſwearing?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Truely Gods name is taken in vaine, diſhonored,
                  Prayer.
                and this commandement broken, in praying alſo aſwell as in ſwearing: for if I powre out a ſort of wordes without féeling, or any burning intire affection, if I drawe néere with my lippes, and my hart be farre away, certainely I abuſe the holy name of my God in ſo calling vpon him, and I am guilty of the breach of this law. For beſide that reaſon teacheth vs God careth not for lippe labour, it is the rule of the holy Ghoſt, that when wee pray,
                  Epheſ. 6.18.
                we ſhould pray in ſpirite, that is with heart and affection.
            
               Que. Howe elſe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Againe, Gods name is taken in vaine, and polluted whenſoeuer it is called vpon in coniuring, witchcraft,
                  Coniuring.
                ſorcerie, charming, and ſuch like. For

the wordes of the lawe are plaine, Let none bee founde amongeſt you that maketh his ſonne and his daughter to goe through the fire,
               
                  Deut. 18.10. &amp;c.
                
               or that vſeth witchcraft, or a regarder of times, or a marker of the flying of foules, or a ſorcerer, or a charmer, or that counſelleth with ſpirits, or a ſoothſayer, or that aſketh counſell of the dead. For all that do ſuch thinges are an abomination vnto the Lorde, and becauſe of theſe abominations the Lorde thy God doeth caſt them out before thee. And many other notable teſtimonies hath your booke quoted in the margin.
            
               Que. Why but in earneſt (to let the reſt paſſe) do you not thinke much good is done and may be done by charming, that is by vertue of ſome wholſome praiers, as a pater noſter, two or three good auees and a creede, or ſuch other good words, neither engliſh nor latin, nor any thing elſe in ſignification oftentimes?
               
            
            
               Anſ. I anſwere to this queſtiō in thrée degrées. And firſt I ſay, the queſtion is not onely whether any good, as you

tearme it, be done or may be doone by a charme, but whether it be or may bee doone lawefully by the ſame, or no. And you heare the word of God plainely condemning the practiſe of it. Wherfore with what conſcience can wee deriue health or anie helpe whatſoeuer either to our ſelues or ours by that meanes that GOD hath ſo fearefully threatned vengeance vnto, were we neuer ſo ſure to obtaine it by the ſame? Secondly what benefite ſoeuer we reape by ſuch forbidden meanes, I dare aſſure you all thinges conſidered, wee gette no good, but muche harme. For what GOD will not haue doone, GOD is neuer the author, worker, and cauſe of properly, and directly, but health or anie helpe to our ſelues or others by charming, the Lorde will not haue procured: therefore of that health and helpe ſo gotten, aſſuredly the Lorde is neither author, worker, nor cauſe directly. If then not the Lorde, who but the diuell? And if it be he, as moſt

aſſuredly it is he, then I pray you let vs all men and women thus reaſon with ourſelues: Is the deuill our friende or our foe, our welwiller or our enemie? Surely we cannot be ignorant of it, he is the ſworne enemie of mankind, the ſerpent that in burning malice deceiued vs once and ouerthrewe vs quite, the roaring lyon that rangeth about without any reſt, ſtill ſéeking out whom he may deuour. And will euer he that hath euen ſworne the woe of vs all, and ſéeketh as Peter ſaith, that is with all diligence and indeuour, with might and maine, with tooth and naile as we ſay, with his candle in his hande light leaſt by any meanes we ſhould eſcape him, applyeth his whole power to deſtroy vs and to bring vs to endeleſſe calamitie, wil he I ſay euer do vs any good, thinke we, but to the ende to inferre thereby a greater plague vpon vs? Certainely he will not: for he were not the deuill if he ſhould, and we may be as aſſured of it, as we are ſure yt he hath that name and nature. Then I ſay let vs marke. We

finde by a charme, bodily helpe in our ſelues or ours. But this would neuer Sathan haue done, vnleſſe he had knowen that the vſing of meanes forbidden by God would ſting our bodies &amp; ſoules to eternall death in the worlde to come. Then ſée ſtill I ſay, and note it. Good he doth vs in bodie, that a thouſande times more euill he may worke both to body and ſoule in the day of iudgement. Temporall eaſe he is content to beſtow vpon vs, that endleſſe diſeaſe, miſerie and woe he may procure vnto vs. This is moſt true, and nowe what good doth charming if all thinges be conſidered? Shall a Chriſtian man and woman ſo hunt for helpe of body or goods, that they ſhall for it looſe bodie and ſoule eternally? Shall our health and wealth be deerer to vs than the Lordes commandement? God forbid, and therefore let vs reſt perſwaded, howſoeuer wee thinke ſuch vngodly meanes procure vs good, yet in déede all thinges conſidered, it is no good: For Sathan being our foe will neuer doe vs good but to the ende to

hurt vs more by it, and the breache of Gods commaundement will ring our ſoules a paſſing peale from face and fauour of the Lorde. Laſt of all (which eſpecially I thinke you would heare) I denie that by the charme any thing at all is doone, whatſoeuer the wordes be. For euerie action muſt haue a fit and conuenient meanes applied vnto the patient to be doone by, but bare wordes, Pater noſters, auees, and creedes, characters and figures are no meanes appointed of the Lorde to doe any cures by, either vppon men or cattle, and therefore if any thing be doone, aſſuredly it is not doone by theſe thinges as the true &amp; working meanes, but by the deuill himſelfe bléering our eies by theſe ſhadowes. And this vaine opinion verie Ariſtotle could mocke and diſdaine as abſurde and fooliſh, Plinie alſo with diuers others.
            
               Que. But howe prooue you by ſcripture that bare wordes being good words be not forcible to this ende?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Surely me thinke beſide others

that example in the acts of the Apoſtles prooueth it, wher we ſée thoſe vagabund Iewes there ſpoken of vſed as good wordes as might be, but all to no purpoſe, when the deuill liſted not diſſemble. And therefore we may ſée it is not the charme that can doe any thing by vertue of the bare wordes. And you can not ſay that vnto the wordes come any faith and good minde of the charmer, for faith leaneth vpon promiſe, and promiſe annexed to a thing maketh it lawefull: but charming hath neither promiſe in the word, nor is allowed, but by name expreſſely forbidden and condemned.
            
               Que. Yet we ſee manie thinges are done by it, and experience daily confirmeth a contrarie aſſertion to you.
               
            
            
               Anſ. True it is and I graunt it, that by charmes diuers are healed, &amp;c. But therefore they were the verie wordes that did it? It is no conſequence. For other meanes might doe it, and yet nothing apparant to vs but the charme. As a witche may hurte mee with ſpeaking to mee, not that her wordes

doe it, but ſome peſtilent thing of an infectiue operation helde in her téeth deliuered her of her diuell to ſuch vſe,
                  Danaeus out of Auguſtine.
                as ſome of them at death haue confeſſed.
            
               Que. What then is your concluſion touching charmers, ſouthſayers, and ſuch like?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Truely this, in ſuch things as I can be aſſured by mine owne true vnderſtanding or others counſell, they doe by true naturall cauſe and meanes in reaſon effectuall to ſuch an end, I may lawfully vſe the benefite of the knowledge giuen them of God and ſéeke their helpe. But where I ſhall knowe the want of theſe meanes, or but in mine owne heart ſuſpect it, ſurely there I may not, there I cannot with a good conſcience vſe them or ſéeke vnto them, for the lawe that willeth a witch ſhould die, being broken of me by vſing ſuch a meanes, ſhall bring greater death to me without repentance.
            
               Que. Howe yet further is Gods name taken in vaine?
               
            
            
               
               Anſ. By raſh and vngodly vowes either made or kept.
            
               Que. Whether might the Iewes vow what they would, or no?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No indéede. But firſt they had a warrant to vowe, and then alſo euen the thing that they did vowe was warranted. And if they went further than their commiſſion, were their intent neuer ſo good, it was reiected. Sometimes they vowed in aduerſitie, to the ende that if it pleaſed the Lorde to deliuer them, they might not onely in generall, but euen in ſpeciall ſhewe their gratefull heart to the Lorde for the ſame. Thus vowed Iacob at his going to Padan Haran, and manie moe in their ſeuerall diſtreſſes. And this they did to preuent and ſtaie in ſome manner the mutabilitie of their will, and frailtie of their nature, which in any griefe eaſily promiſeth to the Lorde, but béeing once freed and ſet at libertie, ſoone forgetteth that ſwéete féeling and all ſpéeches that procéeded from the ſame. Sometime in proſperitie

they vſed to vowe for ſeuerall endes. As for the amplification of that outwarde ſeruice of ſacrifices which then the Lorde required,
                  Leuit. 7.22.
                and this was warranted vnto them to doe. Firſt fruites and tithes warranted alſo,
                  Deut. 12. Exod. 25.
                goulde and ſiluer to the building of the temple warranted alſo. Sometimes they vowed abſtinencie for the ſubduing of the bodie,
                  Numb. 30.
                warranted alſo. Sometimes men vowed themſelues vnto the Lord, as Hanna her ſonne Samuell,
               
                  Numb. 6.
                and this her and their déede was allowed of the Lorde. But if once they came without a warrant, we ſée their ſeruice reiected were their heart and meaning neuer ſo good. Example is Dauid promiſing to builde the Lorde an houſe, with manie others. So euer hath the Lord kept man vnder his hande and direction touching religion, hating the bouldneſſe of man preſuming to inuent any ſeruice of himſelfe. I anſwere you therefore I ſay and you ſée it, that the Iewes might not vowe what they liſted and what they meant well in, but

what the worde of the Lorde gaue them leaue to vowe.
            
               Que. Were they bound euer to keepe their vowe if once they had paſſed it out of their mouth?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No in déede. But it is maruelous worthy noting the excéeding care that the Lorde had leaſt their vowes ſhould become ſnares to their conſciences. Therefore he would not the wiues vow to ſtand vnleſſe her huſband heard and allowed it, nor the daughters without the fathers cōſent. And if they vowed a wicked thing he would not haue it perfourmed as we ſée.
                  Deutro. 23.
                If an vncleane thing were vowed it might be redéemed. And which is eſpecially to be noted if a poore man vowed a vowe aboue his abilitie, being decayed betwixt the time of his vow &amp; the perfourmance, at the prieſts diſcretion he was releaſed,
                  Leuit. 27.
                &amp; not ſnared with the word yt had paſſed him once. For all which you ſée a great libertie granted to mans infirmitie, leaſt by any meanes his mouth might cauſe his fleſhe to ſinne, and howe

it neuer pleaſed the Lorde that drewe ſinne with it in the other hande, as the vnchaſte vowes doe of chaſtitie in the Church of Rome, with ſuch like. But in déede if they vowed a thing lawefull and warranted, and in their powers without inconuenience to perfourme, then were the Iewes verie ſtraitlie bound to perfourme their vowes, and not otherwiſe.
            
               Que. What ſay you then to the argument of the Papiſts, The Iewes vowed and the Lord accepted them. Therefore we may doe the like.
               
            
            
               Anſ. I anſwere it is a ſenſeleſſe concluſion: for they had warrant, wee haue none ſo to doe: the thinges they vowed were warranted, we vowe pilgrimages to this Saint &amp; that, to this Idoll and that, we vowe to be Monkes, Friers, Nunnes, to weare this apparrell and that, to liue ſingle, to abſteine from this meate and that, with a number ſuch inuentions of our owne no where warranted. Laſtly, they were releaſed if anie inconuenience

grewe, our vowes muſt ſtande though bodie and ſoule periſhe for it. Therefore to reaſon from the Iewes vowe euerie way warranted, to the alowance of popiſh and raſhe vowes no waie warranted, is abſurde.
            
               Que. How yet further is Gods name abuſed?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Gods name is yet further abuſed whenſoeuer it is prefixed before anie wicked inſtrumentes, as the Popes bulles and pardons, which commonly beginne thus, In the name of God Amen. So did the ſentences of condemnation againſt Gods children in Quéene Maries daies pronounced by thoſe bloudie Biſhoppes beginne alſo, with ſuch other diuiliſhe inſtrumentes, before which to ſet the name of GOD as though he were author and approouer of ſuch actes, can not be but a fearefull pollution of the name of GOD, and a breach of this commandement. Againe to ſpeake of the name of GOD lightly and

without any dewe regarde thereof in ſportes, playes, and paſtimes, when my conſcience telleth mee I not once thinke of God, neither is that a right vſe of prayer. Alſo to vſe the phraſes and ſentences of ſcripture in ieſt, in diriſion, in mirth vnreuerently as a number doe moſt fearefully. Sure it is a gréeuous breach of this commaundement.
            
               Que. And what ſay you of banning and curſing which the booke heere nameth, and yet is it vſuall with Dauid as it ſeemeth?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Euen this alſo in ſome circumſtance is a great euill and forbidden by this lawe. For thus we are to weigh this queſtion: the matter either is the Lordes or mine owne. If it be mine owne, in no caſe euer ſhould I curſe and wiſh any euill, but patiently abide the Lordes good time to ſée to it. If it be the Lordes, then is the partie either corrigible or incorrigible, and paſt all hope of amendment in mans eyes. If he be corrigible not euen in the Lordes

cauſe ſhould I curſe my brother, but if he be paſt hope in mans iudgement, then conditionally may wee pray the Lorde either to turne him or to remooue him, that no longer he may reſiſt his glorie. And to this head are Dauids ſpéeches moſt of them to be reduced. Others are pleaſed with this anſwere alſo, that Dauid had the gift of propheſie, whereby hee might ſée and ſay more than we may ſafely followe hauing not the like gift in vs.
            
               Que. What if I heare a man commit anie of all theſe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Certainely they that in zeale of heart and loue to the offender doe not rebuke the abuſe of Gods name, as their calling alloweth them, doe alſo ſinne againſt this commaundement. So doe they againe that being vtterly vnworthy take vppon them raſhly or couetouſly the calling of the miniſterie, as they alſo who admitte ſuch into the ſame.
                  Malach. 1.
                The Prophet is plaine if wee marke him in this caſe. And to ſpeake much in

a worde, that wee may ſooner ende▪ by a careleſſe and a wicked life is the name of GOD greatly prophaned. For the Lorde ſayth, You ſhall kéepe my commaundementes and doe them,
                  Leuit. 22.31.
                neither ſhall you pollute my holie name. Where wee plainely ſée that whoſoeuer doth otherwiſe than GOD commaundeth, polluteth his name. And let ſeruauntes count their maiſters worthy of double honour ſayeth the Apoſtle,
                  1. Tim. 6.1.
                that the name of God and his doctrine be not euill ſpoken of. And more néere goe other places, when it is ſaide,
                  Deutro. 28.58. &amp; 15. &amp;c.
                
               Thou ſhalt obſerue and doe all thinges, &amp;c. That is, thou ſhalt bende all thy thought and care vppon this, howe thou mayeſt kéepe my lawes and ſtatutes. Whereby wee firſt ſée excluded all fayned and careleſſe walking in the waies of the Lorde, and that the Lorde regardeth him that trembleth at his wordes. Secondly we ſée by it not onely Atheiſtes, but euen euerie one that is not touched with a great deſire by their good life

to glorifie God, to be guiltie of this law. And therefore we may hereby ceaſe to maruell at the afflictions of thoſe men in whoſe liues we haue ſpied no great outward offence. For albeit they haue not greatlie to mans eyes offended, yet if they haue not obſerued to kéepe his ſtatutes, that is carefully feared and fled euen from verie little breaches, the Lorde hath iuſt occaſion to puniſh their coldneſſe. Laſt of all the neglect of thoſe meanes that God hath appointed for welfare either of bodie or ſoule, is a breach of this lawe. For the words and workes of his wiſedome may not bee refuſed as néedeleſſe, which were to detract from his wiſedome, but with all thankefulneſſe and readines imbraced, that in ſo doing his wiſedome may bée honoured. And thus doe you ſée in ſome part, the breadth of this commaundement.
            
               Que. What then remaineth yet to conſider?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Theſe wordes (thy God) are not to bee paſſed ouer without ſome

profite to vs: and verie well may wee ſée in thē that our obedience ought euen in this commandement alſo to procéede of loue, an loue ought to make vs moſt carefull to pleaſe the Lorde. Then are we to weigh the reaſon annexed, namelie, that the Lorde will not holde him guiltles that taketh his name in vaine, which is as great a threatening as may be. For all our helpe ſtandeth in this, that the Lord in Chriſt pardoneth vs and will not charge vs with our faultes, which if hee will not doe, but enter into iudgement with vs, néedes muſt we die, and abide eternall woe. Therefore howe ſhoulde this reaſon mooue vs all and euer to a reuerent regard of his name?
            
               Que. Nowe then I pray you, as in the former, ſhewe mee how I may fruitfullie vſe the cogitation of this diſcourſe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. In the examination of our ſelues by this commaundement, what ſhould we doe, but euen lay before vs, as with one ſight we may ſée then fully the ſeuerall

branches nowe repeated of the ſame, carefully waying in what caſe we ſtande, if we ſhould be iudged according to them. And firſt to beginne with falſe and vaine ſwearing, where is that man or woman that can excuſe themſelues in it?
                  Swearing.
                Hath there neuer paſſed an oth from me in all my life, but before the magiſtrate whē I was lawfully called thervnto? Yes, yes, God knoweth both often and gréeuouſly hath my ſinne appeared in this behalfe. My ſpéech hath not béene yea, yea, and nay nay, as it ſhould haue béene, but bitterly and vehemently, earneſtly, and vngodlilie hath this tongue of mine added more. Yea (which was madneſſe now I ſée) I haue ſought to get and kéepe my credite with mortal man by ſwearing, &amp; to looſe it with my God by ſo offending. But O curſed credite ſo gotten, where were mine eyes, where was my vnderſtāding? Whether is it better for the preſent time of mē to be beléeued, &amp; of the Lord for euermore abhorred, or with light vngratious people, with whom othes be onely truth,

to abide a little deniall, and of God my God euer for my obedience to be loued? Yet haue I witleſſe wretch made choiſe of the former manie a time and neglected the later. For ſworne I haue often to be beléeued, when I ſhoulde haue abſtained, of God to bée loued. If anie rebuked mée, it was vnſeaſonable, it was vnſauorie, ſure I am, I liked not of it, and ſure I am I amended not by it. Nay haue I not either excuſed othes to be no othes, but affirmations, or openlie euill ſpoken of ſo good admonition, or at leaſt ſecretelie in my heart diſdained with ſcorne, and iudged it fooliſh and preciſe curioſitie? What hath anie man to doe with mée? Let euerie veſſell ſtande vppon his owne botome, if I ſinne it is worſe for me, amende your ſelfe and care not for others. Theſe haue béene our ſpeaches and ſuch like, I feare me, in the impaciencie and ignorance of our heartes, and therefore of ſwearing to ſay no more, ſinned wee haue and excuſe wee want, the Lorde graunt pardon to our treſpaſſe. If I

looke at the reſt, am I able to ſay I am not guiltie in them? No, no, not I, nor anie fleſhe liuing, I am ſure of it, but that the Lorde for ſinne will not let vs ſée our ſinne, weigh our ſinne, nor grant vs iudgement to diſcouer our guilt. For what man or woman may not the righteous God ſummon to his high courte and ſay,
                  Praying, or Singing.
                Thou art faultie of taking my name in vaine by praying? Alas for my ſelfe, I ſée it in the time of mine ignorance I haue pattered often with colde affection, for paraduenture I knewe not what I ſayd, thinking the déede doone to be ſeruice liked, and the words pronounced all to bee well. And euen nowe ſince the Lord hath opened mine eyes that I knowe it to be ſinne to pray without attentiue minde vppon the thing I doe, and without ardent affection, yet howe harde it is to doe it euer, and neuer to ſwarne or ſtray, I find it, yea euen impoſſible to my corruption. For this thing and that thing is ſathan readie to trouble ſo fruiteful an exerciſe withall, and a thouſande wayes he hath

to make the minde to wander from the thing it onely ſhoulde attende. If affection be good, attention faileth: and if attention ſtande, affection dyeth. And therefore ſéeing that euen reaſon teacheth mee that to call vppon the name of God not as I ought to do is plainly to abuſe his name &amp; take it in vaine, neither in this point can I cleare my ſelfe but broken herein alſo I haue this his commaundement. What vaine vowes and promiſes haue paſſed from me néedeleſſe to be made,
                  Vowes.
                and fruitleſſe to be kept? For ſorcerie and witchcraft, charming and coniuring am I able to ſay I haue as earneſtlie abhorred them as I ought, &amp; euerie way ſo abſteyned from them as I ſhoulde? Nay hath not rather eaſe béene ſought in paine of mee by theſe meanes,
                  Charming.
                or at leaſt wiſhed if I coulde haue gotten them? My ſelfe and my friends, my children and goods haue I loued obedience more than thē? Or hath not euer ſome baſe creature as ſwine or ſuch like béene dearer to mee than the Lord, ſéeking by charme to ſaue the one,

and not fearing by ſinne to looſe the other? God ſift not my guilt euen nowe in this: for practiſe or will, for my ſelfe or for others wil ſurely accuſe me. Further and beſide al theſe, let it be wel weied of anie Chriſtian heart that feareth God indéede, and carefullie ſéeketh the credite of his name, howe often vnreuerentlie in ſporting and playing, in ſhooting &amp; bowling, in diſing &amp; carding,
                  Gaming.
                we vſe his name,
                  Scripture phraſe.
                howe the phraſe of ſcripture wil rowle out of our mouthes in ieſting and light conferences, howe fearefully we vſe him in curſing &amp; banning our bretheren,
                  Banning.
                and ſurely he ſhall ſée no ſmal guilt touching this commā
               dement in euerie one of vs, if God in iuſtice weigh vs in the balance, and rewarde vs as he findeth weight of ſinne full duelie to deſerue. Where is that happie man or woman, ſo waking and ſléeping, ſo ſitting and going, ſo ſpeaking and kéeping ſilence, ſo liuing and dying as for no ſin of theirs, for no infirmitie, for no ſlip or fal, ye name of God &amp; truth hath bin euil ſpoken or thought

of. Let this man and woman appeare and boaſt that in great meaſure they haue kept this commaundement. But if none ſuch can bee found, whoſe frailtie hath not foſtred in reprobate minds a miſliking of good thinges, then let all fleſhe fall downe before his footeſtoole and ſewe out pardon, for that liuing ſo looſelie they haue taken his name in vaine and broken this commandement. Laſt of all if wee caſt our eyes about &amp; conſider a little the manifolde meanes prouided by the Lord to do vs good in bodie and ſoule and euerie way,
                  Meanes not vſed.
                are we able to ſay wee haue neglected none, but euer vſed them as wee ought, reuerentlie, carefullie and with thankeſgiuing? Hath neuer an vnprofitable baſhfulneſſe made vs conceyle our bodilie griefe, or refuſe the meanes thought méete to doe vs good? Hath not careleſſe contempt robbed vs of the remedie appointed for our ſoules? And hath not vnthriftie ſelfewill reiected meanes to increaſe our wordlie eſtate? If theſe all or anie be true, we haue deſpiſed the

wiſedome of the Lord, which appeareth in theſe things, and ſhould be magnified by them, and in them, we haue polluted his name our ſelues, greatly occaſioned others to thinke lightly of good things, and grieuouſlie guiltie we ſtand before him for it, of the breache of this commandement. What ſhould I ſay of not rebuking others according to our place, whom we haue noted to offende in any of theſe,
                  Not rebuking.
                which is a thing as hath béene ſaide, required alſo in this Lawe, and therefore a thing that reſting in vs doeth crie for vengeaunce, though in all the reſt wee were pure and innocent? For we were not borne for our ſelues, but alſo for others: and the bodie, the ſoule, the goods and eſtate of our brethrē ſhould be déere vnto vs, we not ſéeing and ſuffering them by our wils to do the thing that we knowe will hurt them. What I ſay ſhould I ſpeake of this and many other braunches yet remaining? Doe we not ſée already ſhame ynough and grieuous ſinne in great abundance? Where were we nowe then euen for

theſe that haue béene named, if the percing eyes of the liuing GOD ſhould prie into vs, and with iuſt rewarde ſéeke to pay the wants he could eſpie in vs? Could we eſcape the pit of endleſſe paine? Speake in the feare of God euen what you ſée. Are you pure and blameleſſe in theſe all? Dare you ſtande out and make the challenge, Come iudge &amp; ſtay not, ſift me and ſpare not, thy tryall I feare not, for all theſe haue I kept from my youth? O ſinnefull fleſhe eſpie thy caſe. Thou canſt not, thou maieſt not, and I knowe thou dareſt not, vnleſſe the dreadfull wrath of God haue ſealed vp thy ſight. And therefore euen in this commaundement alſo as in the former, crie rather vp to heauen with ſhrilliſh ſhrike, Waſh me O Lord from theſe my ſinnes, and cleanſe me from my wickedneſſe. Haue mercie vpon me O gratious God, and according to the multitude of thy mercies doe away mine offences. O ſweete Sauiour, who may not ſee what he is without thee? Full heauie laden I

come vnto thee Chriſt my deere God, as thou haſt promiſed, refreſh and eaſe me. Amen, Amen.
            
         
         
            The fourth Commaundement.
            
               Remember that thou keepe holie the Sabaoth day.
            
            
               Queſtion.
            
            
               
                  WHat is the meaning of this commaundement?
            
            
               Anſ. Your booke anſwereth that the hallowing of the Sabaoth day, is to reſt from our labours in our calling, and in one place to aſſemble our ſelues together, and with feare and reuerence to heare, marke and lay vp in our hearts the worde of GOD preached vnto vs, to pray altogether that which we vnderſtande with one conſent, and at the times appointed to vſe the Sacramentes in fayth and repentaunce,

and all our life long to reſt from wickedneſſe, that the Lord by his holy ſpirit may worke in vs his good worke, and ſo begin in this life euerlaſting reſt.
            
               Que. Had not the Iewes diuers feaſts beſide this Sabaoth?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Yes in déede. Some of God immediatly appointed, and ſome by themſelues vpon ſpecial occaſion. By ye Lord they were tied to thrée ſolemne feaſts in the yere, at which he would haue all the males to appeare before him. To wit, The feaſt of vnleauened bread, that is Eaſter,
                  Leuit. 23. Exod. 23.15.
                or the paſſeouer in remēbrance how the Angel paſſed ouer their houſes, when in one night he ſlewe all the firſt borne in AEgypt both of man and beaſt. The feaſt of the harueſt of the firſt fruits of their labours which they had ſowen in the fields,
                  Verſe. 16.
                which was Whitſontide or Pentecoſt, in remembrance that ye lawe was giuen fiftie daies after their departure out of AEgypt. And the feaſt of gathering fruits in the end of the yeare,
                  Verſe. 16.
                when they had cleanſed the fields. This was the feaſt of Tabernacles, putting

them in mind that 40. yeres they dwelled in tents and tabernacles in the wilderneſſe. Beſides theſe they had the firſt day of the moneth, the 7. yere, the Iubile, and ſuch others.
                  Iudith. 16. 1. Machab. 4. Heſter. 9.
                The feaſt of the Macchabees, the remembraunce of deliueraunce by Heſter, and ſuch others had they then againe appoynted by themſelues.
            
               Que. And euen of this feaſt of the Sabaoth as I doe thinke there were diuerſe kindes: were there not?
               
            
            
               Anſ. By that which hath béene ſaide it partly appeareth ſo. For in déede they had euery ſeuenth day a Sabaoth,
                  Exod. 23. Leuit. 25.
                and that was called the Sabaoth of dayes, they had euerie ſeuenth yere a Sabaoth, and that was called the Sabaoth of yéeres. Then reckened they 7. times 7. yeres, which was 49. and the fiftieth yéere was their Iubile. They had alſo their great Sabaoth, as when the Paſſeouer fell on the Sabaoth day, as it did when Chriſt ſuffered. For it is there ſaide that that Sabaoth was a great day.
                  Iohn. 19.
                But paſſing ouer

theſe thus named by the way, this commaundement occaſioneth vs to thinke onely of the Sabaoth of daies, &amp; to conſider therein what remaineth and what is taken away. Where marke firſt that both in the Sabaoth &amp; other feaſts, they were preciſely tyed to certaine circumſtaunces of time, as what day in what moneth, how many dais together, when begun, when ended, what feaſts only at Hieruſalem, what elſewhere, with what rites and orders, &amp; ſo forth. And for this Sabaoth of days yt this commandement ſpeketh of, ſo preciſe reſt was required in it, yt further than a Sabaoth daies iourney, they might not trauell in it. They might not bake,
                  Exod. 16.29. Chap. 35.3. Numb. 15.
                nor ſeeth any meat, nor ſo much as gather any ſtickes to doe it withall. Now confer and lay vnto theſe places thus ſtrictly tying thē the words of Paul to ye 
               Galathians,
               
                  
                     
                        •
                     .70.
                
               Ye obſerue days and moneths and times &amp; yeres. Daies as the Sabaoth, newe moones, &amp;c. Moneths as the 1. &amp; the 7. Times as Eaſter, Whitſontide, Tabernacles, &amp;c. Yeeres as ye 
               7. &amp; the 50. &amp;c. Which beggerly rudimentes

are moſt pernicious to them which haue receiued the ſwéete libertie of the Goſpel, thruſting them back vnto ſuperſtitious bondage againe. I am afraide of you, ſaith Paul, &amp;c. Therefore if we mark this conference of ſcriptures &amp; times we euidently ſée the caſe ſtandeth not now vnder ye Goſpel touching this Sabaoth, as then it did. Marke again the ſame Apoſtle to the Coloſſians. Let no man (ſaith he) iudge you in meat or drinke, or in reſpect of an holy day,
               
                  2. verſe. 16.
                
               or of ye new moone, or of the Sabaoth daies which are but ſhadowes of thinges to come, but the body is in Chriſt. Therefore you ſée a change. Adde hereunto and mark ye practiſe of Chriſt, who indéed not refuſing al vſe of their Sabaoth &amp; feaſts at ye firſt did both himſelfe teache and be preſent at other exerciſes in ye ſame. But yet yt he might ſhew that he did not that of neceſſitie (as in former time it was done) now &amp; then wold he both by word and practiſe inſinuate an abrogation or a chaunge of the ſame from former eſtate vnder the law as by thoſe words:

               The Sonne of man is Lord alſo of the Sabaoth,
               
                  Matth. 12.8.
                and againe by defending his Diſciples when they had plucked and rubbed the eares of corne on the Sabaoth day, healed on it, and preached other daies beſide that day, &amp;c. By all which I ſay it may well appeare, that there is not the ſame eſtate of the Sabaoth nowe vnder the Goſpell, that was of it vnder the Lawe.
            
               Que. How then I pray you ſtandeth it nowe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. There was in this commaundement touching the Sabaoth euer ſomething morall, and ſomething ceremoniall. Whatſoeuer is morall remaineth ſtill to vs as much to be obſerued as euer of them: and whatſoeuer then was but ceremoniall, that is nowe by Chriſt taken away, and we freed from it. As for example, to haue one day in the ſeuen to ſerue the Lorde generally in, that was morall and remaineth ſtill, binding vs vnto it, as alſo to reſt that day from all labours, letting the courſe

of pietie and ſanctification that that day ought to be kept. But to haue preciſely the Saturday, and to reſt ſo ſtraitely from all labour as they did, that was but Ceremoniall and a ſhadowe, and therefore nowe abrogated by the comming of the bodie Chriſt.
            
               Que. Yea but euen the day alſo now in our Church is chaunged from Saturday to Sunday.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Trueth it is, and for that matter marke and conſider in the Scriptures, that as Chriſt in his time, ſo after him his Diſciples in their time did beare a while with the infirmitie of the Iewes and taught on the Sabaoth, and Paule haſted to Hieruſalem againſt the feaſt of Pentecoſt, yet ſo,
                  Actes. 13. Actes. 20.
                that euer ſtill they inſinuated a fréedome by Chriſt,
                  Act. 2. &amp; 5. &amp;c.
                and therefore dayly alſo met, &amp;c. But when as falſe teachers vehemently vrged a neceſſitie thereof, to ſhewe the fréedome by Chriſt from dayes &amp; times, then in déede ſtoode they againſt it, and chaunged euen the verie day quite and

cleane.
            
               Que. But did the Apoſtles in deede themſelues make this alteration of the day?
               
            
            
               Anſ. How ſhould we otherwiſe thinke when we conſider theſe and ſuch other places? Firſt it is ſaide in the Actes that The Diſciples being come together the firſt day of the weeke to breake breade, Paule preached,
               
                  Acts. 20.7.
                
               &amp;c. Nowe the firſt day of the wéeke with the Iewes was Sunday, immediately following their Sabaoth, wherein they vſed not to receiue the Sacramentes and heare the worde preached ordinarily, yet here wée ſee the Diſciples did, and not on their Sabaoth, which was but the day before: therefore you ſée a chaunge of the day euen by the Diſciples. Againe to the Corinthians Paule commaundeth that the Collection for the poore, which was a worke of the Sabaoth, ſhoulde bee made euerie firſt day of the wéeke, that is on the Sunday,
                  1. Cor. 16.2. Mark. 16.2. 1. Iohn. 20.1.
                as wee call it. And therefore wee plainely ſée what day they celebrated and mette vppon

hauing their ſolemne aſſemblyes, namely, on this our Sabaoth, laying aſide quite the Iewiſh Ceremonie. And it addeth alſo further ſtrength to this, that Iohn ſaith in his Reuelatiō
                calling this our Sabaoth day the Sunday, Dominicum Diem, The Lordes day.
               
               
                  Apoc. 1.10.
                All or any of which teſtimonies if we woulde ſéeke to delude, beſide the iudgementes of them that haue noted theſe places, the Hiſtoricall teſtimonie of thoſe dayes, and ſince will preuaile. For in Euſebius wee reade it the witneſſe of Dyoniſius the Corinthian,
               
                  Euſeb. lib. 4. Cap. 23.
                that in thoſe dayes they celebrated for holie the Lordes daye.
                  Lib. de idololatria.
                
               Tertullian naming the ſolemnities of the Chriſtians, beginneth firſt with the Lordes day, which they celebrated, and ſheweth their exerciſes.
                  Apollog. 2.
                
               Iuſtinus Martyr nameth the ſame daye and ſheweth the workes. Ignatius againſt ſome that being Chriſtians woulde retayne the Iewiſh Sabaoth ſaith in plaine tearmes, Wee celebrate no longer the Iewiſh Sabaoth, but euerie one that loueth

Chriſt, kéepeth nowe holie the Lordes day being honored with his reſurrection. The like witneſſeth Auguſtine, Cyrill, and euen all antiquitie. And therefore though wee ſée not the verie time definitely named when this Sabaoth was chaunged, yet we ſée it was by the Apoſtles in their times, and therefore hath credite ynough. Nowe the holy Church of Rome that would by this alteration made by this primitiue and pure Church chalenge authoritie and libertie to chaunge and doe what they liſt, ſurely wee muſt denie their conſequence till ſuch time as they bréede in vs by good proofe that credite of their ſpirit that wee haue and ought to haue of the Apoſtles that made this alteration of the Sabaoth from Saturday to Sunday.
            
               Que. This ſatiſfieth mee for my part touching the alteration of that which was but ceremoniall in this commandement, namely, the day and the preciſe reſt in it, neither can it bee otherwiſe than abſurd for any falſe Church, onely

vnder a title and an vſurped name of a Church to chalenge authoritie to doe matters both contrarie to pietie and comelineſſe, becauſe the true Church of God hath doone what was moſt agreeable to them both. But now as I ſee the bond vnto any particular day only, &amp; to ſuch ſtrict reſt in the ſame as the Iewes obſerued, is taken away by Chriſt, ſo yet ſee I what is morall remaineth, namely a day in ſeuen, and a certaine reſt in the ſame. Wherefore I deſire aſwel to know the reaſon of the remaining of the one, as I haue the cauſe of the abrogation of the other: and therefore firſt I pray you why haue wee ſtill yet a Sabaoth and ſhall haue till the ende of the world: and ſecondly, what reſt and exerciſes are therein required?
               
            
            
               Anſ. The ends of the remaining of a Sabaoth yet ſtill in the Church of God, are chiefely thrée. Firſt that we might haue a kinde of reſemblance and forme of our eternall reſt from ſinne in the kingdome of God. Secondly, that by this meanes ſeruants and cattle might

bee prouided for againſt the cruell gréedineſſe and vnſatiable couetouſneſſe of ſome maiſters and owners. And laſtly, that Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline &amp; ſome eſtate of a Chriſtian common wealth in performing to the Lorde ioyntly together demanded dueties, might this way be eſtabliſhed.
            
               Que. Of euerie one of theſe I pray you ſeuerally,
               
               
                  Maiſter N.
                
               for more plaineneſſe, and firſt, what is that ſpirituall reſt and ſanctifying of the Sabaoth which layeth before vs a reſemblance of eternall reſt?
            
            
               Anſ. That is when reſting from worldly buſineſſe, and from our owne workes and ſtudies, wee yéelde our ſelues wholly to GODS gouernaunce, that hee may doe his worke in vs, &amp; when (as the Scripture tearmeth it) we crucifie our fleſh, wee bridle the froward deſires and motions of the heart, reſtraining our owne nature that we may obey the will of God. For thus doing our Sabaoth day here vppon earth ſhall moſt aptly expreſſe

a figure and likeneſſe of the eternall and moſt holie reſt which wee ſhall for euer enioy in Heauen. Yet euer muſt wee knowe that theſe thinges are not to be doone onely on the Sabaoth, but euen all our life long, euerie daye of euerie priuate man, and this one day is appoynted chiefely aboue the reſt, for our negligence and weakeneſſe ſake only, without which ſuch appointment it is greatly to bee feared ſome woulde neuer doe it.
            
               Que. And is this ſpirituall reſting from ſinne in deede neceſſarie in euerie one that will as he is bounde ſanctifie the Sabaoth?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Surely it is euen ſo neceſſarie, as that without this all our other reſting, putting on our better apparell, going to the Church, hearing ſeruice, &amp;c. is nothing, but euen abhorred of God and deteſted. This is a great matter if wee had grace to conſider of it, yet nothing but plaine &amp; open ſcripture. For what ſaith the Prophet Eſay? Bleſſed is the man that doeth this,
               
                  Eſay. 56.2.
                
               and

the ſonne of man which layeth holde on it, he that keepeth the Sabaoth and polluteth it not, and keepeth his handes from dooing any euill. Sée what it is to kéepe holy the Sabaoth in the iudgement of the Prophet, euen to kéepe our handes from dooing any euill, that is to ceaſe from ſinne and our owne wayes. Againe the ſame Prophet in another place:
                  Eſay. 58.13.
                
               If thou conſecrate the Sabaoth as glorious to the Lorde, and ſhalt honour him, not dooing thine owne wayes, nor ſeeking thine owne will, &amp;c. And in his firſt Chapter alſo,
                  Eſay. 1.13.14.
                
               I cannot ſuffer your newe Moones, nor Sabaothes, nor ſolemne dayes (it is iniquitie) nor ſolemne aſſemblies, my ſoule hateth thē, &amp;c. And why ſo? The reaſon foloweth in the next wordes (For your handes are full of bloud) that is, you abſtaine not from ſinne, remaine ſtill in auarice, deceite, crueltie, extorſion, and ſuch like, which as long as you doe, howſoeuer you ſéeme to ſanctifie the Sabaoth, I abhorre you and your dooings. And then followeth notably a deſcription euen of

this ſpirituall reſt: Waſh you, make you cleane, take away the euill of your workes from before mine eyes, ceaſe to doe euill, learne to do well, ſeeke iudgement, releeue the oppreſſed, iudge the fatherleſſe, defend the widow, &amp;c. Many other ſuch places are there.
            
               Que. Now I pray you of the ſeconde end and vſe of the Sabaoth a little alſo.
               
            
            
               Anſ. That was and is, as hath béene ſaid in regard of ſeruants, and the brute beaſts, who are to haue mutuall reſt frō their trauel, which yet ſome cruel vnſatiable wretched miſers woulde hardly haue graunted, had not God inſtituted this day both for man and beaſt to reſt in. This yt I ſay is euident in ye words of this law, and therefore it néedeth no further proofe. But let vs thus profit by it. Firſt it doth woonderfully ſhewe the goodnes of God, who neglecteth nothing that he hath made, but carefully prouideth for ye welfare euen of brute beaſts. O faithleſſe hearts, if wee can doubt the goodnes of our God to vs, when we here before vs ſée his care for thoſe creatures whō he hath made vs lords of. Secondly,

it well teacheth vs what nature, pietie, and charitie requireth at our hands touching our ſeruauntes and Cattell. Nature ſaieth:

                  
                     Quod caret alterna requie durabile non eſt.What wants his mutuall reſt and eaſe ſtill toſt in paine and ſtrife,
                  Can not continue long that courſe of labour, or of life.
               
            
            And therefore nature hath appointed aſwell the one as the other for her creatures, &amp; willeth that ſenſeleſſe hearts in vs ſhould not breake the ſame. Pietie willeth yt we ſhould let them ſerue God on this day aſwel as our ſelues, yea euē ſée yt they doe it,
                  Epheſ 6.
                
               Who are all one with vs in Chriſt, made of ye ſame god, redeemed with ye ſame price, ſubiect to ye ſame hell if they doe not, &amp;c. Charitie requireth yt we ſhould haue a féeling of ye paines of our ſeruants.
                  Deutro. 5. Chap. 15.
                Thankfulneſſe would acknowlege ye mercy of god, in making me maſter &amp; him ſeruāt, whē he could haue don otherwiſe if it had pleaſed him. And to cōclude, if this reſt we denie either to ſeruant or cattle, we ſhewe there is no regard of nature in vs, no pietie, no charitie, no thankfulneſſe to God for our eſtate,

but the contraries of all theſe. I woulde to God men woulde carefully thinke of this, who vpon euery occaſion can finde in their heart to ſende horſe and men, cart and cariage too and fro on the Lordes day moſt wickedly. Aſſuredly it will haue a ſmarting recompence in the end.
            
               Que. The third and laſt end of the Sabaoth, yet remaineth touching reſt and exerciſes required. I pray you what reſt are we bound vnto, and what ſpecial exerciſes on this day?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Concerning the former it hath bin ſaid before, yt there is required of vs this day a reſting from our proper labors in our calling, as your booke ſaith, ſo farre as they are hinderances to that ſanctifying of the Sabaoth, that is required of vs. For in it thou ſhalt doe no maner of worke, &amp;c. That is no maner of worke that thou canſt not doe, and attende alſo to the exerciſes commaunded for the Sabaoth: as the artificer cannot worke in his ſhop and goe to Church to pray and heare, the countrey man cannot both ſerue ye Lord with

his neighbours at home as he ought, &amp; ſerue to his chapmen his ſolde Corne in the wéeke dayes alſo, &amp;c. Therfore from theſe we muſt abſtaine.
            Now for the ſecond thing, namely, the exerciſes demaunded at our hands, many they are, and hard of me or any to be either named or eſpied, ſo large is the lawe of the Lorde. But as I can I will lay before you ſome of them. And firſt to begin withall, foraſmuch as without knowledge of God there is no loue of God, without loue no faith, &amp; without faith no ſaluation by God, therefore it is a worke or exerciſe of the Sabaoth, a duetie that we are ſtraitely bound vnto, in that day to attend to ye knowledge of God, by aſſembling our ſelues together into one place, and there with feare and reuerence to heare, marke and lay vp in our hearts the worde of God read or preached vnto vs.
            
               Que. How prooue you this?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Doe you not remember ye ſpéech of the Shunamites huſband to her when her child being dead,
                  2. Reg. 4.23.
                ſhe deſired an Aſſe to be ſadled that ſhe might go to ye man

of God? What wilt thou do with him to day ſaieth he, ſince it is neither newe Moone nor Sabaoth day? Whereby you may plainly ſée that on thoſe holy daies they carefully reſorted to the Prophets to be inſtructed in the will of the Lord.
            In the Acts of ye Apoſtles againe thus we reade, that The firſt day of the week,
               
                  Actes. 20.7.
                
               that is on the Sabaoth day, the Diſciples being come together to breake breade, Paul preached vnto them, ready to depart on the morow and continued preaching till midnight.
            
            In another place,
                  Actes. 13.16. Reade Luk. 4.16. &amp;c. to the 21. verſe.
                
               After the lecture of the law &amp; the Prophets, the rulers of the ſynagogue ſent vnto them, ſaying, ye mē and brethren, if ye haue any exhortation for ye people, ſay on: with a number mo ſuch places. Whereby euidētly we ſée ye manner of kéeping holy the Sabaoth in thoſe dayes. Yet is not the going to the Church &amp; outward hearing of the word all, but they are The good ground that heare the worde and vnderſtande it,
               
                  Matth. 13.23.
                
               bearing fruite and bringing foorth ſome an hundred folde, ſome ſixtie, and ſome thirtie.
            
            
               
               Que. Theſe places are plaine touching the cuſtome of Gods children in times paſt, and beſide theſe very reaſon would teach vs that if God hath of ſet purpoſe in great wiſedome appointed one day generally, of all men and women to bee obſerued: ſurely he would haue on that day none to lurke at home in an hole, withdrawing themſelues from GOD, from his worde, from their brethren, and from all commaunded exerciſes on this day: and therefore in my opinion our recuſantes, as wee call them, that is our refuſing Papiſts to come to Church, doe greatly offende, I pray you what thinke you?
               
            
            
               Anſ. I ſettle no ſentence of them, but what the dreadfull voyce of the eternall Iudge ſhall pronounce vppon them, in his generall day to the horror of bodie and ſoule euerlaſtingly, in the boyling heate of vnquenchable fire, vnleſſe they repent, ſée and amende their intollerable obſtinacie againſt the Lorde. For can it bee that the Lorde ſhoulde pronounce accurſed all them that kéepe not euerie tittle of his Lawe,
                  Deutr. 27. vlt.
                and yet

not puniſhe them, that prophane his Sabaoth by withholding themſelues from the Congregation, refuſing appointed dueties by GOD himſelfe, and at home or abroade, in this corner and that, vnder this hedge and that, patter to themſelues, what God knowes they vnderſtande not, and therefore conſequently what the Lorde deteſteth, and will aſſuredly charge them withall as ſinne in that day of his? Howe can wee heare theſe examples of Gods children, purpoſely ſet downe in his woorde to teache vs and our ſelues perfourming no ſuch duetie, yet boldely preſume of mercie? What the beſt of them with all their learning coulde ſay, for defence of this their follie, haue wee not heard, and may wee not reade? Too childiſh and friuolous are their reaſons to iuſtifie ſo great impietie. I referre you to ye reading of them your ſelues, together with the anſwers made vnto them by the godly. This onely my ſelfe I ſay, yt if I were a Papiſt and had to this day

refuſed to come to the Churche to receiue the ſacrament, &amp;c. yet I aſſure you now ſéeing the weake grounds of theſe doctors (for mo thā one had their heads about them, though one beare the name) I ſhould begin to looke better about me, and neuer pin my euerlaſting eſtate in paine or bliſſe vpon ſo ſlender &amp; vngodly perſwaſions of peruerſe men. But what ſhould we ſpeake of reaſon which truly they haue not of their denial? God and many a conſcience of theirs knowe full wel, yt it is not any impietie, which they are able to charge our prayer or preachings withall, but a ſecret ſworne or promiſed obedience to the forren Antichriſtian power of Rome, without knowledge what they doe, blindly conſenting to do as others doe, &amp; haue done, for vaine glory, and worldly ſpéeche amongſt a fewe of their owne packe, that maketh them obſtinate againſt ye Lord, deſpiſers of his Sabaoth, rebellious againſt their lawfull and moſt gracious Prince &amp; her lawes, vnkind cōtemners of the counſell of their deareſt friendes, breakers of their heartes whoſe liues

they ought to loue, increaſers of their woe whoſe paine in pietie they ſhoulde neuer wiſh to ſée, &amp; finally euen euerie way to God, to Prince, to Countrey, to friendes, &amp; their owne ſoules enemies moſt daungerous and pernicious. The Lorde Ieſus Chriſt open their eyes, touche their hearts, and conforme their practiſe of behauiour to his will, if it may ſtand with his good liking.
            
               Que. I pray you nowe goe forward in recitall of the exerciſes of this Sabaoth.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Secondlie beſide the diligent hearing of the worde preached on this day and read vnto vs, it is our dueties and a godly exerciſe fit for the day amongeſt our ſelues, or with our paſtor and preacher to conferre and talke of that which hath béene ſaide, and to aſke queſtions howe this and that is to be vnderſtoode. Such example haue we in the Goſpell, where it is ſaide that when Chriſt was alone,
               
                  Mark. 4.10.
                
               they that were about him with the twelue asked him of the parable which before he had vttred, and he readilie expounded the ſame vnto them. Then vttered he moe, and without

parables ſaith the text, ſpake nothing vnto them,
               
                  Verſe. 34.
                
               but he expounded all things apart to his Diſciples.
            
            Thirdly to receiue together the ſupper of the Lord,
                  Luke. 22. Acts. 20.7.
                as we are commanded, and the Church euer accuſtomed to doe. To attende vnto Baptiſme, if occaſion ſo ſerue, duely pondering the promiſe that is paſt vs, to ſerue the Lorde, and praying faithfully for his guiding grace to be powred vpon our ſelues, &amp; that or thoſe infants then preſented to the Church, that they and we may euer fulfill what we haue vowed before the congregation. Fourthlie from a true féeling heart of Gods receiued goodnes to giue him thankes on this day for his many and great mercies vpon bodie and ſoule, at home and abroad, vpon our ſelues and ours, knowen and vnknowen, beſtowed the wéek paſſed vpon vs, to pray for the continuaunce of the ſame, all the next wéeke enſuing, &amp; euer elſe, with his gratious ſupplie of all neceſſaries whatſoeuer, without the which either our worldly eſtate, or ſpiritual obedience to him cannot be ſuſtained.
            
               Fiftly to conſider of the poore which the Lord hath ſet amongeſt vs as ſubiects for our loue to worke vpon, to ſée what they want, how they liue, &amp; to viſit them and prouide for them. This hath euer of Gods children béene greatlie regarded, and is a part of the diſcipline of the Church alſo. The Apoſtle Paul ordained a gathering in the church of Corinth euery Sabaoth day to this vſe,
                  1. Cor. 16.1.
                and that to the example of other reformed Churches. Chriſt viſited the cripples and lazers on the Sabaoth day,
                  Iohn. 5.
                and healed him that had none to put him in the poole. The borne blinde he healed on the Sabaoth day.
                  Iohn. 9.
                And from the godlie care of our forefathers touching this matter, haue flowen our hoſpitals, and almes-houſes, with ſuch like. This is an exerciſe of fayth and loue fitte for all times, but chiefely on the Sabaoth day to be regarded. Thus wee féede Chriſt when he is hungrie,
                  Matth. 25.35.
                cloath him naked, viſite him ſicke, and ſo foorth, and ſure ſure ſhall wee bee to finde it at the generall accounting daie of his.
            
               Laſtly to take care and conferre amongeſt our ſelues how to mainetaine all meanes that ſerue to the knowledge of God, as the miniſters, ſcholers, vniuerſities, ſchooles, and ſuch like: To meditate alſo this day more than other daies of the creatures of God and of his excéeding goodneſſe toward vs in them,
                  What it is to keepe holy the Sabaoth day.
                is an exerciſe of the Sabaoth, with a number ſuch moe, that were nowe too long particularlie to name. Therefore to conclude and end this matter, eaſilie may we hereby ſée, that to kéepe holy the Sabaoth day, is nothing elſe but euen to ſeparate, and conſecrate the ſame to all godlie exerciſes wherein our faith to God and obedience is to be ſhewed.
            
               Que. If theſe then and their like bee commanded to vs on this day to be perfourmed, their contraries I take by the ſame Lawe to be forbidden.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Truth it is, and muſt néedes be ſo, but I thinke it néedeleſſe now againe to goe ouer them, and ſhewe their contraries: rather wey them your ſelfe, and marke them particularly. Onely theſe I wiſh by name may more duelie bee

thought of, that if the ſanctification of this day conſiſt greatly in labouring to knowe the Lorde by the preaching of his worde, howe ſhall they ſafely paſſe the curſe of God for the breache hereof, who with benummed ſoules, parched, padded, ſenſeleſſe, and euery way moſt hardened hearts, either lie and ſléepe on the one ſide idle, or toſſing the alepot with their neighbours, ſuffer this day to paſſe without any inſtruction, and like dumbe dogges hold their peace, no way diſcharging the dutie of a true miniſter, and one that tendereth the glory of God, his owne, &amp; his peoples ſoules. What ſhould I ſay of them that ſéeing the harueſt great and the labourers fewe, and féeling within themſelues. working a ſecrete power, perſwading to put their helping hand to this buſineſſe, yet doe not, but ſuffer the people to pollute the Sabaoth for want of teaching, and ſtay themſelues from this worke of the Lorde vpon cauſes, that as it is to be feared will melt away and not ſtand to excuſe them, when GOD ſhall come vnto iudgement. Euery ſeruaunt

to his owne maſter, it is true, ſtandeth or falleth, yet may one ſeruant admoniſh an other to béeware betimes, and therefore with my whole heart I wiſh a due regard hereof. Againe, if to ſanctifie the Sabaoth, be to conſecrate it to holy vſes, ſuch as haue béene named, is it poſſible for vs to eſcape the reuenging hande of the eternall God, if he content in mercie with one day in the 7. we denie him that alſo, and dedicate it to drunkennes, to feaſting and ſurfetting, &amp;c. Nowe in ye name of the God of heauen, and of Ieſus Chriſt his ſon, who ſhall come to iudge the quick &amp; the dead at the latter day, I require it of al that euer ſhall reade theſe words, that as they wil anſwere me before the face of God &amp; all his Aungels at the ſounde of the laſt trump, they better wey whether carding, diſing, &amp; tabling, bowling, and cocking, ſtage plaies and ſummer games, whether gadding to this ale or yt, to this bearebaiting &amp; that bulbaiting, with a number ſuch, be exerciſes commanded of God for the ſabaoth day or no. O hartal froſen &amp; void of the féeling of the mercie

of thy God, yt hauing euery day in 6. euery houre in euery day, &amp; euery minute in euery houre ſo taſted of the ſwéet grace of thy God in Chriſt, as that without it thou hadſt periſhed euery minute, yet canſt not tel howe poſſibly to paſſe ouer one day to his praiſe, vnleſſe one halfe of it be ſpent in carding &amp; bowling. Awake awake in Ieſus Chriſt admoniſhed awake, &amp; ſéeing al the wéeke long, ye Lord of heauen doth defend &amp; féede thée, cōfort &amp; bleſſe thée, &amp; is contented but in one day eſpecially to be regarded, vow wt thy ſelf in requeſt of ſtrength to kéepe it, that to the Lord yt one day ſhall be conſecrated of thée, &amp; obſerued according to his will.
            
               Que. Theſe things thē thus paſſed ouer, I pray you are theſe words, Six days ſhalt thou labour, &amp;c. a commaundement, ſo that we ſinne, if we labour not on them al?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No, they are no commandement, but a permiſſion, or a remiſſion rather of ſo much right of ye Lords. For euer hath ye Church vpon occaſions ſeparated ſome of ye wéeke days alſo to the ſeruice of the Lord, &amp; reſted from their labors. Which they neuer wold haue preſumd to do, if ye
               
Lord had commaunded to the contrary. And euen now our holy daies commanded by publike order, are not all to be miſliked, if to the glory of GOD and ſanctification of his name, they be beſtowed as they are intended. Therefore a commaundement I ſay they are not, but a remitting of the Lords right who in déede might chalenge all.
            
               Que. And for the 7. day it ſelfe may wee not in caſe doe any thing thereon, becauſe the words here are ſo, in it thou ſhalt doe no maner of worke, &amp;c?
               
            
            
               Anſ. I haue ſaid before if you remēber that the preciſe &amp; ſtrict reſt of the Iewes on this day was ceremoniall, &amp; therfore now by Chriſt taken away, that it bindeth not vs. And therefore touching your queſtion and our eſtate in theſe daies vnder the Goſpell, very certaine it is, that not euen in the ſeuenth day we ſtand ſo bound to reſt, but that in it alſo we may worke, if either neceſſitie ſo vrgently requireth, or the déede doone be greatly to the glorie of God. Examples of the firſt are Dauid eating the ſhewebread,
                  1. Kings. 22.
                and the Diſciples gathering

and rubbing the eares of corne. Of the ſecond, Chriſt himſelfe healing on the ſabaoth day many, which yet the Iewes thought to be vnlawful. The diſcourſe of Chriſt touching this point in the Goſpell is very woorthy noting, wherein he flatly and ſtrongly refuteth this ſuperſtitious conceit of the ſabaoth in the Phariſees, and all other by diuerſe argumentes: as firſt by the example of Dauid aboue named. Secondly of their lawfull practiſe, they circumciſed children, and ſlewe their ſacrifices &amp;c. on the Sabaoth. Thirdly by the teſtimonie of Oſce, I will rather haue mercie than ſacrifice. That is, loue to our brethren, than outward ſeruice. Fourthly from the leſſe to the greater, it is lawfull on the Sabaoth day to pull out a brute beaſt that is fallen into a pit, or is in ſuch like danger, as néeds it muſt be helped, or elſe it periſheth, therfore much more a man, &amp;c. By all which you ſée that man is not made for the Sabaoth, but the Sabaoth for man. And euen in the right of our Chriſt, wee alſo are in ſome ſort Lordes of the Sabaoth, as

in it, to doe what vrgent cauſe conſtraineth in déede, and may not conueniently be differred.
            
               Que. Here is named in the wordes of the commandement the ſtraunger that is within the gates. I pray you therefore howe farre thinke you this bindeth vs?
               
            
            
               Anſ. I doe willingly ſtill tell you my opinion in euerie thing, my ſelfe and you alſo I truſt readie to yéeld to better aduiſe when we ſhall heare it. For my part I ſée not how we may aunſwere it to the Lorde, if being priuate men and houſeholders, we ſuffer within our gate to lurke and lie hid, and that refuſeth to obey the Lord in the ſanctifying of this day, as is commaunded to the glorie of his name, after that ſuch meanes haue béene vſed for the reforming of them as poſſiblie we can. And the more I wey with my ſelfe that moſt ſtraite law of ye Lorde for execution of them that ſhould ſéek to eſtrange any from the true God,
                  Deut. 13.
                the more I am confirmed by the verie end, equitie and meaning of it in this opinion againſt al affection of kindred, aliance, friendſhip, or whatſoeuer. Reade

the words, &amp; mark the zeale which God requireth in al men towards him, when as no meanes will reforme our friends, but they ſtil peraduēture tempt vs. And then by the way let it not paſſe vnmarked I pray you, howe ſtraitely all maſters and miſtreſſes ſtand bound to ſée that the Lorde be honoured not onely in themſelues, but by manſeruaunt and maide ſeruant, olde and young in their houſes of diſcretion, of the Sabaoth day, ſéeing God of purpoſe nameth them. And ſée againe how this naming of the ſtraunger doubleth the bond more vpon vs. For by compariſon if we ſtand charged with our ſtranger and gueſt, much more with our daily ſeruauntes, children, &amp;c. it muſt néedes be, and indéede wey it well.
            
               Que. I am then thus I thinke ſatisfied in euery point of this commaundement, neither doe I remember what further to aske you herein.
               
            
            
               Anſ. The commandements of the Lord (ſaith Dauid) are exceeding broad, neyther in déede is any man able ſo to laie open any one of them, but iudgement

by the gift of God increaſed more may be ſéene and eſpied in them: but thus much nowe ſhall ſuffice for my meaſure, this only added, that this reaſon drawen for the Lordes owne example, who reſted from his worke on this day, ought greatly to mooue vs to the carefull kéeping of it: as euen the very firſt worde alſo of the Lawe, for if you marke it, he doeth not ſay, Kéepe holie the Sabaoth day, but Remember to keepe it holie, that is, haue an earneſt care of it, and in any caſe forget it not, but remember to kéepe it holie. And thus much of this Commaundement.
            
               The examination of the conſcience.
               The profitable vſe and application of this commandement, is to wey and duely conſider that it is the Lawe of no man, but of God the chiefeſt lawegiuer, the wiſeſt, moſt righteous, and moſt able

to reuenge, inſtituted of purpoſe by him for theſe and ſuch like ends. Firſt, that we ſhould wholy conſecrate as that day ourſelues vnto the Lord, &amp; his ſeruice, hearing, reading, meditating thoſe things, which might lay before vs the goodneſſe of almightie God toward vs, and our great ingratitude to him againe, with all other ſinnes, whereby we haue prouoked him to wrath, ſtirring vp our hearts to true repentaunce for them, and amendement of the ſame. Secondly for the eaſe of ſeruants &amp; cattell, which otherwiſe by the vnmerciful gréedineſſe and crueltie of ſome might happily be abuſed. Laſtly to expreſſe and lay before vs ſome ſhew of that ſpirituall and eternal reſt in heauen, which we all ſo looke and long for. Then theſe thinges conſidered, to call to minde howe often and grieuouſly wee haue offended againſt euery one of theſe, as againſt the firſt by abſenting ourſelues from the Church,
                     What it is to be abſent from Church, and place of common prayer.
                   and place of common méeting, when wee might haue béene preſent, if wée woulde, a very horrible thing, if we could duely regarde

and thinke of it. For what is it but to contemne GOD and his wiſedome, to ſtriue and fight againſt the Spirite, teaching and conuerting men by the miniſterie of the worde, and euen in effect to ſay I am as wiſe and godlie, as either hee can make mee, or ſhall make mee: I will none of his grace. What is it but to giue a grieuous offence to others, for the which the liuing God hangeth a woe ouer our heads, ſaying, Woe be to him by whom offence commeth: it were better for that perſon to haue a milſtone tyed about his neck, and to be caſt into the bottome of the Sea: And againe, It were good for that man if he had neuer beene borne? What is it but to féede the deuils humor, and to doe that thing, that moſt highly pleaſeth him? Againe to conſider howe we haue offended, when we were preſent at Church by negligent and colde performaunce of that thing, which time, place, and duetie required at our handes. Haue we neuer come to the hearing of the worde, but with reuerence, with willing deſire,

preparing our hearts before vnto it by ſome ſecrete prayer within our ſelues, to the Lorde, that he would bleſſe the ſpeaker, that hee may ſpeake to our heartes and bleſſe vs, that we may attentiuely hearken, profitably féele, and thankefully taking whatſoeuer is ſpoken, increaſe in obedience to it? Haue wee neuer come to the Sacramentes, when we could, and neuer without ſuch examination, and other circumſtances, as are ſtraitly required of a Chriſtian? Haue we ſpent the Sabaoth in godly conference &amp; meditation, powring out thanks from a féeling ſoule for ye Lords goodnes euer to vs, &amp; namely the wéeke paſſed? Haue we viſited or thought vpon the ſick, ſore, diſeaſed, impriſoned, baniſhed, or any way ſuffring for a good cauſe &amp; to our power comforted them? Haue we ſtudied how either to procure or continue or increaſe amongſt our ſelues, or our neighbours the meanes of ſaluatiō, as ye preaching of the word, &amp; ſuch like? O beloued, we haue not, we haue not, we know it &amp; muſt néeds confeſſe it, if there be any trueth in vs. Too much haue we

neglected all theſe, yea euen diuerſe of them, it is greatly to bee feared, haue litle or neuer at all troubled our heads: but for their contraries in moſt ful meaſure we haue wallowed in them, and with gréedineſſe euer accompliſhed thē. Where is the miniſter whoſe negligence hath not made his people to pollute the Sabaoth? Where is the people whoſe conſciences awaked may not iuſtly condemne them for vngodly gadding on this day to Churchales, to weddings, to drinkings, to bākets, to fairs, &amp; markets, to ſtage plaies, to bearebaytings, &amp; ſummer games, and ſuch like? Where is that maſter that hath had a conſcience to reſtrain his ſeruants from this impietie, or the ſeruant againe that hath either brideled himſelfe for ye Lords cauſe, or elſe wel accepted his maſter or miſtres reſtraint being made vnto him, and which hath not rather burſt out into vngodly &amp; diſobedient ſpéeches, murmuring yt becauſe he hath wrought all the wéeke, therfore he ſhould haue libertie to do what he liſt on ye Sabaoth, not conſidering yt this commandement bindeth

not only ye maſter himſelfe to honor God on this day, but to ſée to his family ſo much as he can, yt they alſo do it. Nay I would to God ye maſters in many places were not ringleaders to their owne &amp; al other mens people, to prophane this Sabaoth of the Lord, and that euen ſuch maiſters as in reſpect of their calling, office and credite in the countrey, ſhould farre otherwiſe doe. When doeth a gentleman (to name no higher eſtates) appoint a ſhooting, a bowling, a cocking, or a drunken ſwearing ale, for the helpe as they ſay of ſome poore one, but vppon the Sabaoth? And if he be at ye Church in the forenoone, for the after noone it is no matter, he hath béene verie liberall to God in giuing him ſo much. What day in the wéeke vſually doeth he giue ſo euill an example of vnmeaſurable ſotting in bed, as on the Sabaoth? But O filthie ſauour that ariſeth out of this lothſome chanell, thus raked vp into the noſtrels of the Lorde! I ſpare to ſpeake, I ſhame to ſée, I rew to knowe what I fully knowe againſt our ſoules in this reſpect. Let euerie man and woman

more particularly view thēſelues, and lay open vnto the Lorde their ſinne in ſorowe for it, by this occaſion thinke what is commaunded, looke what wee haue done, &amp; the Lorde make our ſinfull hearts to ſée, &amp; ſigh for ſo great offence againſt our God. What ſhould I ſay of the ſecond end of the inſtitution of the Sabaoth, namely for the reſt of ſeruant &amp; cattell? But euen in an word, woe to the man whom God ſhall iudge according to his guiltineſſe herein. For it is too vſual with al eſtates to be a meanes to robbe their ſeruauntes of the bleſſing due to the kéepers of this law, and to pull vppon them the plague for the contrarie by making them ride and run, poſt and away, vpon euerie occaſion that commeth in their heads, when in truth if they would but euen look into it, the matter may be done wel without ſuch haſt. O happie is that man whoſe heart thinketh howe his ſeruant is bound to this commandement of kéeping holy the Sabaoth as well as hée, hath a ſoule to looſe or ſaue as well as he, to be nouriſhed with the foode of the

word as well as he, and therefore thereon concludeth, he will neither ſinne himſelfe nor make his ſeruant ſinne in breach of this or any other commandement. The third end of the Sabaoth we heard it was, that hereby might bee reſembled in ſome ſort our ſpirituall reſt in heauen, wee ceaſing from our owne workes, &amp; dooing the will of God. But are we able to ſay, wee haue this doone? O miſerable men ten thouſand times if in this we ſhould haue our deſertes: for wherein or howe crucifie we the fleſhe more on this day than any other, bridle the frowarde deſires of the heart, reſtrayne our owne nature, and doe the will of God more on this day than any other? Alas our owne conſciences crie vnto vs, we doe nothing leſſe, wee drinke, wée eate, wée ſurfet, wee ſweare, we play, we daunce, we whore, we walke and talke idlely, vainely, vncleanely and vngodlily: theſe are our workes on ye Sabaoth more commonly than any day in the wéeke elſe, and if this bee to reſemble a ſpirituall reſt, then in déede wee doe it, not otherwiſe.

Thus ſtand wee therefore guiltie and gréeuouſly guiltie of this commaundement. So that if we had not a Sauiour who in our fleſh had fulfilled this lawe and euerie one for vs, and appeaſed the wrath of God his father, iuſtly conceiued againſt our ſinnes, neuer ſhould we haue looked within his kingdome. And howe ſhall we bée better for all which he hath doone, but by ſéeing our paſſed ſinne, and namely our fowle and careleſſe abuſe of this Sabaoth of our God, by lamenting the ſame euen from our hearte rootes, purpoſing vnfainedly to amend it hereafter, and euen euer while life endureth to bee more carefull to honour God on this day than we haue bin, and by ſtedfaſtly beléeuing in Chriſt, and for Chriſt, and by Chriſt, to haue all that is paſt forgiuen? This is the way to bee freed from the curſe of this commandement, and all other which we ſo gréeuouſly haue tranſgreſſed, and therefore iuſtly deſerued. O mercie great and marueilous, O nature ſwéete &amp; patient of our God, who contenting himſelf with one day in ſeuen chiefely to be his,

and yet robbed of the ſame alſo by vs vile wretches, notwithſtanding til this day hath ſpared vs, whereas a thouſand times &amp; a thouſand he might with great right haue deſtroyed vs either amongſt our pottes, or in our daunces, or idle in our beds, aſking vs if that were to halow his Sabaoth, or to honour his name to ſwill and to bibble, to leape, to walowe and tumble in bed, till it bée noone, with ſuch like. Nowe doeth he ſpeake, nowe doth he warne, nowe doth he admoniſh, loth to puniſhe vs if any ſaying will ſerue, as a moſt mercifull God, and if nowe we will not conſider, learne and bee inſtructed, that our wayes heretofore haue not béene good, and therefore amend them, ſurely ſurely, if God be God, we ſhal taſt his hand, for ſo great diſobedience. Nowe the liuing God awake vs, and touch vs truely in this behalfe, mercifull father lay it neuer to our charge, for thy great mercies ſake, wherewith wee haue gréeued thée touching this commandement, but increaſe our knowledge, increaſe our féeling, increaſe our conſcience, carefullie

to lyue and ſpende our dayes in thy feare and fauour, as thou mayeſt bee honoured, the power of thy worde magnifyed, our brethren mooued with good example, our ſelues ſaued in the great day, and this Sabaoth of thine for euer hereafter more carefully kept of vs, to the better performance of the former, for Chriſt his ſake, Amen. Amē.
               
            
         
         
            The fifth Commaundement.
            
               Queſtion.
            
            
               
                  WHat containeth the ſecond Table?
            
            
               Anſ. As the firſt contained all dueties due to the Lorde, inwarde and outward, ſo the ſeconde Table containeth all dueties due to our brethren, either in heart or action. And therefore in this ſecond table are laid the very groundes of all ciuill ſocietie, from whence all mens lawes procéede, if they be iuſt.
            
               
               Que. But doe theſe workes of the ſecond Table concerne onely our neighbours?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No, we may not thinke ſo. For though outwardly they be done to men and immediately as the proper obiect of them, yet in déede they are doone alſo to God, and he more delighteth in them, than in all burnt ſacrifice. For if wee féede our brethen, cloath thē naked, viſit them ſicke, or any way doe them good, God taketh it as doone to himſelfe.
            
               Que. When any preſcription is made to men in the Scriptures what they ſhoulde doe, why ſo often and vſually are the workes of the ſecond table appointed?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Not that they are better than the workes of the firſt Table, but for that they are the true bewrayers of them: for euerie hypocrite will ſay he loueth God, feareth God, truſteth in God, &amp;c. becauſe theſe are ſecrete dueties in the heart, and of man cannot be iudged, but looke howe he liueth toward his neighbours, and it may ſoone bee ſéene that fayling in the dueties of the

ſecond Table towardes men, the dueties of the firſt which he boaſteth of in trueth are not in him. For if they were, they woulde bring forth the other. He that ſaieth he loueth God whom he neuer ſawe,
               
                  1. Iohn. 4.
                
               and hateth his brother whom he hath ſeene, is a lyer.
            
            
               Que. Which is the firſt commaundement of the ſecond Table?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy dayes may be long, &amp;c.
            
            
               Que. What is meant by honour here?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Reuerence, obedience, &amp; maintenance, if néede require.
            
               Que. What is this reuerence.
               
            
            
               Anſ. It is a true acknowledging in my heart and minde of that ſuperioritie, which God hath giuen either my parentes, or any other perſon, together with a willing declaration of the ſame, by any ſuch outward geſture or behauiour, as it may be declared in, or by.
            
               Que. How prooue you that we muſt reuerence our Parents?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Many ſufficient proofes hath it in the word, but a fewe may ſuffice vs. You ſhall feare euerie man his father,
               
                  Leuit. 19.3.
               
               
               and his mother, ſaieth the Lawe of God, that is, if we expound it, ye ſhall ſtande in a reuerent awe and regarde of them with loue: for wee muſt néedes vnderſtand a ſonnelike feare, not a ſeruile in that place. Againe, Honour thy Father and mother,
               
                  Epheſ. 6.2.
                
               which is the firſt commandement with a promiſe, ſaieth the Apoſtle: this honour implieth reuerence. Thirdly the example of our Sauiour Chriſt performing this reuerence to his mother and his reputed father Ioſeph,
               
                  Luk. 2.
                doeth prooue it to vs. And that example of Salomon, who being King, and hearing that his mother came to ſpeake with him, went to méete her, bowed downe to her cauſed a ſeate to be ſet for her,
                  1. Kings. 2.
                and placed her on his right hand. Laſtly, the Scripture expreſſely forbiddyng ſuch thinges as are contrarie to this reuerence, manifeſtly prooueth the ſame to bee our duetie.
            
               Que. What is contrary to it?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Firſt, to curſe Father or Mother is manifeſtly contrarie to it, and hath not the Scripture forbidden it,

ſaying:
                  Deut. 27.16.
                
               Curſed bee he that curſeth father or mother, and let all the people ſay Amen? And againe, Hee that curſeth father or mother ſhal die the death,
               
                  Exod 21.17.
                
               yea he ſhall die,
               
                  Leuit. 20.9.
                
               and his bloud be vppon him.
            
            
               Que. What elſe is contrarie to it?
               
            
            
               Anſ. To ſmite Father or mother is apparantly contrarie to it, and this alſo hath the word forbidden:
                  Exod. 21.15.
                
               He that ſmyteth Father or Mother ſhall dye the death. Alſo to mocke our Parentes is contrarie to this reuerence we owe them: and therefore is it ſaide in the thirtie of the Prouerbes,
               
                  Prou. 30.
                
               The eye that mocketh his father, or deſpiſeth the counſel of his mother, let the Rauens of the field deuoure it, and the young Eagles picke it out.
            
            
               Que. Howe if the Sonne bee a Magiſtrate and the Father none, whether muſt he then reuerence his Father, or no?
               
            
            
               Anſ. In matters that concerne his office he muſt doe his office, and his Father muſt acknowledge his authoritie, but in priuate places, and matters, notwithſtāding

he is a Magiſtrate, he muſt doe reuerence to his Father, as is due, neither taketh Magiſtracie this duetie from man, or out of man, for they may both well ſtand together.
            
               Que. How prooue you it?
               
            
            
               Anſ. King Aſa executeth his office,
                  1. Kings. 15. verſe. 13.
                and depoſeth his mother, wee reade, yet otherwiſe no doubt he reuerenced her as a childe. And pretily was it ſaid of Taurus the Philoſopher, when the Father and Sonne came to him about a matter, the Sonne being a Magiſtrate and the Father none, that the Father ſhould ſit downe vpon that one ſtoole, that he had, till the queſtion was diſputed, whether of them ought of right to haue it.
            
               Que. And are the children onelie bounde?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No in déede, but there is a duetie aſwell of the Parents to their children, as of the children to their Parentes.
            
               Que. And what is that I pray you?
               
            
            
               Anſ. In generalitie this it is. If Parentes looke for at their childrens

handes, honour, that is reuerence, obedience, and maintenaunce, if they néede according to abilitie, then is it queſtionleſſe their dueties, ſo to behaue themſelues towarde their Children, as that theſe things may be dewe vnto them.
            
               Que. In particularitie what procureth reuerence to them?
               
            
            
               
                  Parents behauiour.
               
               Anſ. Firſt and formeſt, if Parentes will bréede this in their children, let them in any wiſe carefully looke to their lyfe and behauiour before them. For truely graue, modeſt, and vertuous behauiour ſtriketh the heartes of both children, ſeruauntes, and all other beholders, with a reuerent conceite of ſuch perſons, and contrariwiſe light behauiour looſeth the ſame.
            
               Que. What eſpeciall things can you name that in deede looſe Parentes and ſuperiors this reuerence?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Neglect of Religion, Drunkenneſſe, incontinencie of lyfe, vncomely talke, wanton behauiour, ſwearing, with ſuch like, and which may not be forgotten, brawles, iarres,

and vnkindneſſe betwixt man and wife before their children and ſeruants.
            
               Que. What elſe breedeth reuerence?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Good bringing vp, a duetie which the Parentes doe owe to their children, as farre as their power will reache, and which in déede maketh the children performe to them their dueties the better.
            
               Que. How prooue you that parentes are bound to this?
               
            
            
               Anſ. The Apoſtle giueth an expreſſe commaundement of it ſaying,
                  Epheſ. 6.4.
                
               Fathers, prouoke not your children to wrath, but bring them vp in inſtruction and information of the Lorde. And the neglect of this bringing vp maketh many Parentes want good behauiour in their children. For verie great is the force of it to good or euill, as that Heathen man Lycurgus by his two whelpes verie liuelily ſet out, the ſtorie whereof is this: Lycurgus deſiring to let the Lacedemonians ſée the force of Education, brought forth on a day to them two whelpes,
                  The force of Education.
                which he had diuerſly brought vp: ye one he had accuſtomed

to the fielde, the other kept euer at home, and with them he brought out alſo an hare, and a pot of potage: which when hee had ſet downe, the one according to his vſe of bringing vp, tooke preſentlye to the Hare, and the other vtterlie neglecting, what euen nature ſhoulde haue wrought a regard in him of, as preſently betooke himſelfe to the potte of Potage. Sée then ſayeth Lycurgus O yée Lacedemonians, what bringing vp is in verie brute and vnreaſonable creatures, howe much more muſt it néedes bee effectuall to good or euill in your children? And the example mooued them much. But in howe manie moe examples out of good writings may wee plentifully ſée howe carefull euer all godly Parentes haue béene, that in the fruite of their bodyes the Lorde ſhoulde be honoured, and his true religion planted and placed in their poſteritie: for verie well knewe they that, which experience taught both them and others, that as vertuous and godly fruite is a ſpeciall bleſſing of the Lord,

ſo an vngratious and froward ofſpring is a croſſe, that next after ſenſe of Gods wrath againſt themſelues, doeth ſting moſt bitterly the heart of godly Parentes. And againe they knew that, which wee alſo cannot bee ignoraunt of, that by nature neyther theirs were, nor ours are borne ſo pure, as that they néeded not the induſtrie of their Parentes to reforme them. For both then was it, and nowe is it moſt true, which the ſpirit of wiſedome ſaieth: Fooliſhnes is bound in the heart of a childe,
               
                  Prou. 22.15.
                
               but the rodde of correction ſhall driue it away from him. And in another place, The verie imagination of mans heart is altogether euill from his childhoode.
               
                  Gen. 8.
                Wonderfull hath the care of heathens bin therefore in this reſpect, as partly you haue heard and might moſt largely haue laid further before you, if it were néedefull. An ancient ſaying it was and common amongſt them: Nil dictu foedum viſuue haec limina tangant Intra quae puer eſt. That is, Let neuer any thing vndecent to bee ſaid or ſeene enter into the houſe

where a child is within. Cato that wiſe Counſeller of Rome, thruſt Manlius from the Senate, becauſe on the day time his daughter being by he kiſſed his wife. Plutarch in his booke of this matter ſingularly diſcourſeth of this care, how great it ought to be, and euer hath béen in good men, and he maketh a compariſon betwixt Education and other matters which men much eſtéeme, preferring it before them all: Natalium ſplendor, ſaieth he, res est praeclara, at bonum a Maioribus profectum, &amp;c. That is, Birth and Parentage is a notable thing, but yet deſcending to vs frō others. Riches are highly regarded, yet ſodenly taken from them that haue them, and giuen to them that looked not for them, and euer common to the bad aſwell as to the good. Glorie is a thing in mans eyes honorable, yet euer moſt variable. Beautie much wiſhed for, yet not to be kept any long time with all ye wyſhes &amp; wiſedome in ye world. Onely one thing, ſaith he, there is, the benefite whereof neuer fayleth, but with life, and that is the ſingular fruite of good bringing vp.

               Lycurgus the Rhetorician, when it was obiected to him, that he waſted too much vpon the teachers of his children, aunſwered moſt wiſely, that to a man that in déede would vndertake to better his children to his deſire, he would not onely giue that wages, but euen the halfe of all that euer he poſſeſſed. Such a care had this Heathen of that, which Chriſtians profeſſing God, can be ſo careleſſe of in theſe dangerous and infectiue daies. Ariſtotle could ſay, that looke how much better it is to be well, than to be: ſo much more bound are thoſe children to their parents, that receiue by them good bringing vp, thā they which receiue but their bare exiſtence in the world. An other in Plutarch againe ſaith very pretily, that if he could,
                  Crates.
                he would get him to the toppe of the higheſt hill that any where he might finde, and with all his power, from whence he might furtheſt be heard, crie out vpon the monſtruous madneſſe of thouſands of Parents, that take ſuch intollerable and vnceſſaunt paines to leaue much vnto their children, and yet neuer any care at all in

compariſon, what maner of men or women they ſhalbe, to whom ſo much muſt be left. As though that earthlie pelfe either wholly made a man, or elſe muſt of neceſſitie with worldly credite, cōtinue his poſteritie vpon earth, when want of bringing vp maketh want of knowledge any way, with credit to vſe the ſame. But what view I ſo much the cōmendable care of Heathens in this behalfe? Haue not Gods faithfull béene in this point as carefull as they? Yes truly, many haue, and in better order a great deale. For there being in this thing degrées and ſteppes to be obſerued, as firſt of pietie, ſecondly of learning, thirdly of manners, and laſtly of the function or calling: the children of God, many of them haue in this excelled the Heathen, that being generally as carefull as they in all, particularly in this as men better acquainted with it, through greater giuen light &amp; knowledge they haue far excelled them, that firſt they haue attempted what in déede is firſt to be cared for, namely, to frame the hearts of their children to God and

grace, and then in order to the things following. Wee ſée it in Adam,
               
                  Gen. 4. Gen. 18. 2 Tim. 3. 1. Chron. 28.9. 2. Kings. 4. Deut 6. Pſal. 78.5.
                who taught his ſonnes to ſerue the Lord. We ſée it in Abraham moſt notably. We ſée it in Timothies parentes, who brought him vp from a child in the knowledge of the ſcriptures. We ſée it in Dauid, Ioas the king, &amp; a number others. Generallie to them all it was a cōmandement, that aſſoone as their children could vnderſtand and aſke them queſtions, they ſhoulde carefully inſtruct them concerning the Lords dealings with them, and for them. And I doubt not but many did it of the ancient Chriſtians. Philo writeth that they were called cultores ac cultrices, that is to ſay, Tillers, becauſe as men painefully till their ground, ſo they carefully laboured the grounde of their childrens hearts, to plant in them the feare of God. Nos hodie vastatores ac vaſtatrices, ſaith he, That is, Wee in theſe daies may better bee termed deſtroiers than tillers, ſo rechleſſe we are, &amp; careles in this ſo great a matter. Hence ſprang the Cloiſters in the beginning ſaith Chryſoſtome, &amp; that kinde of life,
                  Lib. 3. contra vituperatores monaſt. vitae.
               
               
namely of the excéeding care that men had to haue their children well brought vp, and excluded from euil company, and hurtful ſights in the worlde, till yeeres and ſetled inſtruction had made them leſſe capable of the harme thereof. Afterward they degenerated from that inſtitution, and became as we well know dens of drones, and nurceries of vngodlineſſe, corrupters of all, not correctors of any, and the wrath of the Lorde hath nowe deſtroyed them. It is a good admonition of wiſe Salomon:
               
                  Prou. 22.
                
               Teache a childe in the trade of his way, and when he is olde, he ſhall not depart from it. And that experienced ſonne of Sirach in many places ſpeaking of this mtater,
                  Syrach. 16.22. &amp; 30. alſo.
                hath theſe wordes, in my opinion not lightlie to be looked on: Neither deſire nor delight (ſaith he) in children, though neuer ſo many, vnleſſe the feare of God be in them. For one that is iuſt, is better than a thouſande: and better it is to die without children, than to leaue behinde vs vngodly ones. Thus let it ſuffice to haue touched this matter, whereof long and large treatiſes are made, néedefull

to be touched, if euer néedefull, and euen long ſtoode vpon. For too much it is of parents neglected, &amp; yet are they grieued, if of their children they be not reuerenced: and howſoeuer many there bee, that in theſe daies are carefull ynough to procure vnto their children knowledge of Artes, of Countries, and of any thing that in worldely ſort may make them mightie, famous, and ſpoken of: yet is the grounde of all verie fearefully neglected, namely to ſetle in them the true feare of the God of Iſraell, deliuered and taught in his worde. Yea it is euen accounted by father and child not ſo néedefull or beſéeming for a gentleman, to the great exaſperating of the Lordes wrath againſt them and their ſéede. Humilitie alſo and ſhamefaſtnes are taken from youth in theſe daies euen by their parents and their teachers, and where it hath euer béene held, that bluſhing in meaſure, modeſtie, and ſilence haue béene commendable tokens in young yeeres, nowe is it a ſhame to be aſhamed at any time, bluſhing is want of countenance and bringing vp,

ſilence is ignoraunce, modeſtie is too much maidenlineſſe, and in ſhort nowe vertue is vice, and vice very comely and gallant behauiour. So times are changed to and fro, and chaunging times haue chaunged vs too. But of this thus farre.
            
               Que. What elſe nouriſheth in children due reuerence?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Due correction. Due I ſay with wiſedome and moderation. For he that ſpareth his rodde,
               
                  Prou. 13.24.
                
               hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him, doth chaſten him betimes.
               
                  19. verſ. 18.
                
               Chaſten thy ſonne while there is hope, and let not thy ſoule ſpare for his murmuring. And in an other place, Withholde not correction from thy childe,
               
                  23. verſe. 13.
                
               for if thou ſmite him, hee ſhall not die.
            
            
               Que. But what if parents in fooliſh pitie cocker vp their children, and pretermit this due aduertiſement?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Then will they looſe this reuerence moſt aſſuredly in their heartes, and often make them come to euil ends. It is prooued by Heli his two ſonnes,
                  1. Sam. 2. &amp; the 4. alſo.
                who by their fathers lenitie conceiued

not what it was to ſinne againſt the Lorde, and therefore to their owne hurt, and their fathers great griefe, taſted the heauie hande of God, and dyed both in a day. Alſo by Abſolon, Ammon, &amp; Adoniah Dauids ſonnes. Whoſe fearefull ends may ſerue for euer to admoniſh all parents, howe they fooliſhly loue their children, and cannot abide to ſay or doe their dueties to them, or yet to let others. Marke well the ſixt verſe of the firſt Chapter of the firſt booke of Kings, and be wiſe betime. A ſmall twigge will not kill the tendereſt Prince, Lord or Ladie in the worlde. If thou ſmite him, ſaieth Salomon,
               
                  Prou. 23.23.
                you heard before, he ſhall not die. I warrant him.
            
               Que. What is the ſecond part of this honour that children owe to their Parentes?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Readie and willing obedience.
            
               Que. And what is that?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Obedience is the performance of Parentes will ſo farre as lieth in our power, and lawfully wée may.
            
               Que. And how prooue you that this

children are bounde vnto?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Firſt, by the words of Salomon: Obey thy father that hath begotten thee,
               
                  Prou. 23.22.
                
               and deſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe is olde. Secondly by the Apoſtle to the Coloſſians:
               
                  Coloſſ. 3.20.
                
               Children obey your parents in al things, for that is wel pleaſing vnto the Lorde. And to the Epheſians againe, Childrē obey your parents in the Lord,
               
                  Epheſ. 6.1.
                
               for that is right. Thirdely it is very ſtrongly prooued by the ſharper puniſhment, which God appointed for all diſobebient children, to wit euen flat and preſent death. For ſo we reade in the Lawe:
                  Deut. 21.18. &amp;c.
                
               If any man haue a ſonne that is ſtubborne and diſobedient, that he will not hearken vnto the voyce of his father and mother, and they haue chaſtened him, and hee would not hearken vnto them, then ſhall his father and mother take him and bring him vnto the elders of the Citie, and vnto the gate of that ſame place, and ſay vnto the Elders of the Citie, this our ſonne is ſtubborne and diſobedient, and will not hearken vnto our voice, he is a riotour and a drunkard, and all the men of the Citie ſhall ſtone

him with ſtones to death, and thou ſhalt put euill away from thee, and all Iſraell ſhall heare and feare.
            
            
               Que. But howe farre muſt a childe obey?
               
            
            
               Anſ. If we paſſe ouer the diſcourſe of Philoſophers touching this matter, and come to the ſcriptures, the Apoſtle Paul determineth it thus,
                  Coloſ. 3.20.
                
               That children muſt obey their parentes in all thinges.
            
            
               Que. Why but ſhall we thinke Paule would haue a childe in deede obey his Parentes in all thinges, as the woordes ſounde? What if they commaund a wicked thing?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No indéede wee may not take Paules wordes ſo generally, but wee muſt expounde that place by an other place of Paule to the Epheſians,
               
                  Epheſ. 6
                where he biddeth children (as you hearde aboue) obey their parentes in the Lorde. And by the wordes of Mathewe where it is ſayde,
                  Matth. 10.
                
               Hee that loueth father or mother more than me, is not worthie of me.
            
            
               Que. And howe then conclude you touching my queſtion?
               
            
            
               
               Anſ. Thus I conclude, that a child is bounde to obey his parentes in all thinges in the Lorde, that is, ſo farre as his obedience may ſtande with the dutie which he oweth to his God, and with ſuch circumſtances touching his owne perſon, as both reaſon and pietie woulde, ſhoulde bee regarded. Which concluſion compriſeth aſſuredlie their obedience as touching mariage.
            
               Que. What begetteth this obedience in children?
               
            
            
               Anſ. When parentes deſire obedience, they muſt knowe that it is their duties to commaund thinges lawfull in reſpect of God,
                  This excludeth forcing to marrie againſt all likeing.
                and conuenient in regarde of their children.
            
               Que. What is the thirde and laſt part of this honour?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Maintainance of our parentes, if néede be.
            
               Que. What meane you by this maintenaunce?
               
            
            
               Anſ. It is a thankfull ſuſtayning of the want of our parents either by our riches, counſell, ſtrength, or any other

thing, which God hath bleſſed vs withall, and they haue not.
            
               Que. But how dare we interpret the commaundement thus: Honor thy Parentes: that is maintaine them as thou art able and they haue neede?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Surely firſt very reaſon telleth vs, that this is as due as either reuerence or obedience: but to let that paſſe, wee haue apparant ſcriptures, where by honor is meant maintenance. As namely in the Apoſtles ſpéech to Timothie: Honour widowes,
               
                  1. Timoth. 5.
                
               that be widowes in deede. That is, prouide for thē and let them be ſuſtained. Againe in the ſame place a litle after, They that rule well are worthy of double honor,
               
                  17.
                where by honour in part is meant maintaynance. Laſtlie in the goſpell of S. Marke our Sauiour Chriſt notablie ſheweth that the Scribes, and Phariſies,
               
                  Marke. 7.
                perſwading children to giue to their vſe, that wherewith they ſhoulde haue helped their Parentes, cauſed them to breake this commaundement in not honoring them as they ſhould. Where we euidently ſee Chriſt himſelfe includeth

in this honour, maintaynaunce, and theſe places as they warrant this interpretation, ſo doe they alſo plainely prooue that children owe this dutie to their parentes.
            
               Que. What further may be ſaide for the warranting of this, that children ought to releeue their parentes wherein they can?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Beſide the teſtimonies of ſcripture nowe alledged to prooue it, the ſpirite of God hath added reaſons to vrge it, and there are alſo examples to perſwade it, and fearefull experiences of Gods wrath vpon the contrarie to feare vs from it.
            
               Que. What reaſons?
               
            
            
               Anſ. In the 6. to the Epheſians the 1. verſe this reaſon is added, becauſe it is a iuſt thing or right. And indéede ſo it is right both in reſpect of God that appointeth it, and in reſpect of that which our parentes haue doone for vs before.
            
               Que. What elſe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Againe in the 3. to the Coloſſians, the 20. verſe this reaſon is aledged, becauſe it is well pleaſing to the Lorde.
            
               
               Que. What examples?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Valerius in his 5. booke and 4. chapter ſheweth a notable example of a daughter that nouriſhed her mother in priſon with her breſtes. And if heathens by the lawe of nature knewe ſo much to be their dutie, how much more chriſtians hauing added thereunto the light of Gods worde?
            
               Que. What elſe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. It is alſo reade of the Storkes, that when they are olde they kéepe continually the neſt, and their young birds prouide for them, and feede them till they die.
            
               Que. Well then, yet what nowe if children refuſe thus to behaue themſelues to their parentes, or neglect it?
               
            
            
               Anſ. They are then to looke for the wrath of the Lorde in them ſharpely with heauie hande puniſhing ſo foule a fault. And to conſider well that as others haue founde him, ſo ſhall they vndoubtedly. Cham, Reuben, Hophin, and Phinees, with a number others are before their eyes, as experiences to be wiſe by, if they haue grace.

And aboue all other Abſolon that graceleſſe man, who like a diſobedient childe to a good father ſought greatly to diſhonour him,

                and ſo horrible was this ſinne, that euen the earth was wearie of ſo wicked a burden and would carie him no longer. The heauens alſo were aſhamed of him, and the wrath of God hanged him vp betwixt heauen and earth, by the heire of his head, till Ioab thruſt him thorowe with thrée dartes beeing yet aliue. A fearefull ſpectacle to all rebelles againſt their Prince, or diſobedient children againſt their Parentes.
            
               Que. Breefely nowe whom doe you note to be comprehended heere vnder the title Parentes?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Firſt Parentes by nature, ſecondly by dignitie and office, thirdly by age, and fourthly by benefit. Generally they are all in ſteede of Parentes to vs, by whome as by inſtrumentes the Lorde deriueth his mercies to vs.
            
               Que. Who be Parentes by dignitie,

or office?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Magiſtrates ouer the people, maiſters ouer their ſeruauntes, miniſters ouer their charges, and ſuch like.
            
               Que. For Magiſtrates what ſay you?
               
            
            
               Anſ. I ſay their place and calling, that portion aboue others which the Lorde hath giuen them of his authoritie, maieſtie, and excellencie prooueth vnto vs, that wee muſt reuerence them. The increaſe and ſafetie of that which wee poſſeſſe through peace maintayned by them, prooueth that we ought againe thankefullie to maintaine them, their eſtate and gouernment by tribute, taxes, ſubſidies, and ſuch like: and for obedience it is in a number of places commaunded, as are alſo the former. Therefore when as all the partes of honour are due vnto them, as reuerence, maintainaunce and obedience, I may conclude Magiſtrates as Parentes are to be honored.
            
               Que. There is no queſtion of anie of theſe, but now how farre are Magiſtrates

to be obeyed?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Certainely but in the Lord, as was ſaide before of our naturall parentes. For the limittes both of the Magiſtrates bidding and our obeying, are theſe two, pietie, and charitie, contrarie to theſe muſt neither they command, nor we doe.
            
               Que. How prooue you this?
               
            
            
               
                  Exod. 1.
               
               Anſ. In the firſt of Exodus, when the kinges commaundement paſſed theſe limittes, the midwiues would not obey, and the Lorde bleſſed them for it. The 3 children obeyed not the king,
                  Dan. 3.
                as we reade in Daniell, Obediah, and Heliah obeyed not the king and Quéene,
                  1. Kings. 18.
                
               Daniell himſelfe obeyed not, and the Apoſtles ſayde God before you muſt be obeyed, with manie ſuch examples.
            
               Que. What if ſtatutes be ſtraite, and in yeelding our pollicie great, may wee not yeelde a litle?
               
            
            
               Anſ. In déede be the wether neuer ſo hote, ſtatutes neuer ſo ſtraite, pollicie neuer ſo great, God is God, hell is hell, we may not do what is good

in our owne eyes, nor decline either to ye right hand or to the left. Read ye prophet.
                  Mich. 6.14. &amp;c
               
            
            
               Que. How prooue you that miniſters are contayned vnder ye name of Parents?
               
            
            
               Anſ. They are in ſcripture reputed ſpiritual fathers, as wee may ſée in manie places, namely to the Corinthians,
               
                  1. Cor. 4.15.
                
               Though you haue ten thouſande inſtructours in Chriſt, ſaith ye Apoſtle, yet haue you not manie fathers, for in Chriſt Ieſus I haue be gottē you through the goſpel. Againe to ye 
               Gala.
               
                  Gala. 4.19.
                
               My litle children ſaith he, of whome I trauell in birth agayne vntill Chriſt bee formed in you. And in his Epiſtle to Philemon,
               
                  V. 10.
                
               I beſeech thee for my ſonne Oneſimus whome I haue begotten in my bonds. Therefore truelie tearmed Elizeus the prophet Eliah, when hee cried, my father,
               
                  2. Kings. 2.12.
                
               my father, the charet of Iſraell, and the horſemen of the ſame. Now thē ſince, they be thus accounted in the worde, proofe enough it ſhoulde bee that all thoſe thrée partes of honour latelie ſpoken of belong vnto them. Yet for more full contentation let vs wey the wordes of Chriſt in the Goſpell, As my father ſendeth

me,
               
                  Iohn. 20.
                
               ſo ſend I you, he yt heareth you, heareth me, &amp; he yt deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me,
               
                  Math. 10.
                with many ſuch. Wherby apparant it is yt in his miniſters God is honored or diſhonored, for obedience to thē in the workes of their calling the ſcripture alſo is plaine,
                  Heb. 13.
                ſaying: Obey them that haue the ouerſight of you, and ſubmit your ſelues, for they watch for your ſoules as they that muſt giue accomptes that they may doe it with ioy and not with griefe, for that is vnprofitable for you. And for their maintenance alſo teſtimonies manie are there in number both in the old and new Teſtament, as Thou ſhalt not muſſel the mouth of the Oxe yt treadeth out ye corne, The workman is worthie of his wages, He that ſerueth the Altar let him liue of ye Altar, He that deliuereth vs ſpirituall things by verie good right ought to chalenge &amp; reape at our hands againe temporall: &amp; to conclude in flat words the Apoſtle cō
               mandeth, let him yt is inſtructed in the worde make him that hath inſtructed him partaker of al his goods, with other ſuch ſpeaches diuers.
            
               
               Que. How prooue you yt maiſters are fathers to and ouer their ſeruants?
               
            
            
               Anſ. For the office and dutie, no man yt is godly wil dout (I hope) that ye Lord hath bleſſed him with that ſuperioritie aboue others, not yt he ſhold rule as a tyrant ouer them, but to loue, chéeriſh, &amp; defend thē euē as a father his childrē, they doing him true &amp; faithful ſeruice. And for the name it ſelfe, beſide a number other proofes, ye plaine place warranteth it in ye booke of ye kings, where Naamās ſeruāts come vnto him &amp; ſay, Father, if the Prophet had cōmanded thee a great thing,
               
                  2. King. 5.13.
                
               wouldſt thou not haue done it? Sée how the ſpirit of God giueth to maiſters the title of fathers.
            
               Que. What preſcription is there in the word for ſeruantes duties towardes their maiſters?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Firſt ſée the words of Paul to the Ephe. Seruants be obedient to them that are your maſters according to the fleſh,
               
                  Epheſ. 6.5.
                
               with feare &amp; trēbling, in ſinglenes of your harts, as vnto Chriſt, not with ſeruice to ye eye as mē pleaſers, but as the ſeruants of Chriſt doing ye wil of God from the hart,

with good wil ſeruing the Lord and not men, and knowe yee that whatſoeuer good thing anie man doth, that ſame ſhal hee receiue of the Lord, whether he bee bonde or free. Secondlie weigh wel the ſame Apoſtles ſpeach to Titus, Let ſeruants be ſubiect to their maſters,
               
                  Tit. 2.9.
                
               &amp; pleaſe them in al things, not anſwering againe, neither pikers, but that they ſhewe all good faithfulneſſe, that they may adorne the doctrine of God our Sauiour in all thinges. Againe to the Coloſſians moſt notablie ſpeaketh the ſame Paul ſaying: Seruants bee obedient to them that are your maſters according to the fleſhe in all thinges, not with eye ſeruice as men pleaſers, but in ſingleneſſe of heart fearing God:
               
                  Coloſ. 3.22.
                
               and whatſoeuer you doe, doe it hartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that of the Lord yee ſhall receyue the rewarde of the inheritaunce, for yee ſerue the Lord Chriſt. The ſame counſell giueth Peter alſo, adding that not onely to the louing, kinde and courteous maſter, but euen to the frowarde alſo, of ſeruants this dutie muſt be performed. And marke this well I beſéech

you, becauſe manie ſeruauntes take their maiſters vnkindeneſſe for an excuſe of their diſobedience or infidelitie in their ſeruices, which indéed muſt not be ſo, ſaith Peter, but be they neuer ſo froward, yet we muſt doe all duetie if wee be ſeruantes, and euen ioy heartily in that croſſe, that notwithſtanding our faithful and paineful duetie, yet we ſuffer vnkin̄de wordes, ſower and ſeuere looks, with ſuch like at their hands. For wee ſerue not them, but GOD in them, ſaide the places before cited, and what good thing ſoeuer we doe, we ſhall receiue it at our good Gods hands again aſſuredly what contempt ſoeuer they ſhewe of vs, caſting vs off vnrewarded, yea euen with hatred, peraduenture for our good wils, as often it falleth out. O ſwéete and moſt ſwéete comfort for all ſeruauntes. What ſtonie heart doeth not euen melt at the conſideration of this gratious nature of the Lord, that if I bee a ſeruannt, and honour him in that my calling by true, faithfull, painefull and louing ſeruice to my maiſter and miſtriſſe, be they neneuer

ſo ſower, ſo waiward, ſo vnkind, ſo bitter, ſo without either diſcretion to diſcerne a good ſeruant, or conſcience, to reward him: yet wil my God, my God, I ſay, neuer forſake mee, but returne into my boſome with his bleſſing my true dealing, liuing and meaning, moſt aſſuredlie, and marke the proofe and practiſe of the ſame vpon Iacob and Ioſeph, with others, as you reade them. Stand therefore in ſtrength, ſerue with comfort, ſlippe not from your calling for want of rewarde, if other abilitie ſerue to continue. The Lords worde is paſt him, his promiſe is out, he wil conſider and recompence all true ſeruants, feare it not, doubt it not, but cleaue to the Lord, and when euer anie ſnubbes and checkes in worde or countenaunce vndeſerued ariſe, ſay in your heart with Dauid chéerefully,
                  Pſalm. 84.
                
               O Lord bleſſed is the man that putteth his truſt in thee.
            
            
               Que. What ſay you of parentes in reſpect of benefites?
               
            
            
               Anſ. I muſt néedes ſay they are greatlie to bee honoured and truely loued agayne, whoſe loue and affection

hath broken out in fruites to vs ward· For ingratitude before God and man is hatefull.

                And hee that rewardeth euill for good, euill ſhall neuer depart from his houſe, ſaith Salomon.
            
            
               Que. Howe prooue you that vnder the title of Father and Mother old men and olde women be meant, and to bee honoured?
               
            
            
               Anſ. The wordes of Paul to Timothie teacheth it:
                  1. Tim. 5.2.
                
               For rebuke not an elder, ſaith hee, but exhort him as a Father, and the elder women as mothers.
               
                  Leuit. 19.32.
                And touching the honouring of them. the lawe is plaine, Thou ſhalt riſe vp before the horeheade, and honour the perſon of the olde man, and dreade thy God: I am the Lorde.
               
                  Iob. 32.6.
                And in Elihu wee ſée the practiſe, who ſtayed his ſpeach, that his auncients might ſpeake before him.
            
               Que.
               
                  Let all towne officers conſider this, and become parents not ſpoilers of the towne.
                
               Howe then may we conclude this matter?
            
            
               Anſ. Thus for this thing we may note &amp; end. That if ye ſcripture to Magiſtrates, miniſters, maiſters &amp; ſuch like ſuperiors haue giuen ye name of parents, thē ought

they al, and euerie one of them in heart, affection, and action, be aunſwerable to the ſame.
            
               Que. Nowe then to proceede, heere is a promiſe added to the keepers of this commaundement, that their dayes ſhall bee long in the land.
               
               
                  Ephe. 6.
                
               And to the Epheſians it is ſaide, that this is the firſt commaundement which is a promiſe, yet was there one added to the ſeconde, if you looke on it, howe then aunſwere wee this?
            
            
               Anſ. We aunſwer, ethat the promiſe annexed to the ſeconde commaundement belonged to all, but this belongeth particularlie to this, and therefore it is the firſt with anie ſpeciall promiſe.
            
               Que. What might be the reaſon of this promiſe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. This may ſéeme to bee ſome reaſon of it. Naturall parentes are the inſtrumentes of life, other parentes as Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and benefactors are the inſtrumentes of good and comfortable life. Nowe it pleaſed the Lord to giue them for a bleſſing long life, who

duetifullie behaue themſelues to the inſtruments of life.
            
               Que Why, but is long life ſuch a bleſſing?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Surely mans life is full of trouble and griefe, it can not bee denied. Yet I anſwere firſt, that notwithſtanding euen to liue and haue a béeing is of it ſelfe a mercie of ye Lords, yet to continue liuing, to ſerue and praiſe the Lorde, to increaſe his kingdome, by anie abilitie in vs, is a greater mercie. For a good nature reioyceth in oportunitie giuen to ſhewe himſelfe thankefull, though it he to his trouble and coſt, and ſo muſt we. Secondlie I anſwere, that al theſe miſeries of mans life haue come of man himſelfe, and not of God, and therefore we ought no leſſe to accompt of Gods bleſſing for ye thing, which we ourſelues haue béene cauſe of. Thirdlie it may be anſwered, ye god doth not promiſe barelie long life in this place, but good with it alſo▪ either in reſpect of outward proſperitie, or inwarde comfort.
            
               Que. Howe prooue you that?
               
            
            
               Anſ. By hauing recourſe to Pauls

wordes, who repeating this bleſſing vpon them that honour Father and Mother, doth not ſay onely, that thou maiſt liue long on earth, but, that it may bee well with thee, and thou maiſt liue long vpon earth. Therfore though mans life be full of miſeries, yet as God promiſeth continuance of it, it is a bleſſing &amp; a great bleſſing.
            
               Que. Howe can this promiſe reſpect vs, ſeeing, it nameth particularly Canaan ſaying that thy dayes may be long in the lande which the Lorde thy God giueth thee, meaning it?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Paul againe doth anſwere this, who boldly putteth for thoſe wordes theſe, on the earth: therefore by his interpretation it is not to bee reſtrayned to Canaan onely.
            
               Que. Doe alwayes they that honour Parentes liue long, and contrariwiſe againe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Wée may not ſay ſo. For all thinges fall out alike to the good and euill, iuſt and vniuſt, ſaith Salomon, meaning of outwarde thinges as life is, and it is the wiſedome of the Lord

it ſhoulde bee ſo, that good things (as wee call them) may not be too gréedilie ſought for, becauſe they are common to the wicked, neither euill thinges be vnlawfullie eſchewed, becauſe they are incident to the good.
            
               Que. Howe then is God true in his promiſes?
               
            
            
               Anſ. So farre as long life may be a benefite to his children, ſo farre hee euer giueth it: but if in wiſedome he knowe it better for them to be gathered to their fathers, then hee taketh them away and recompenceth want of temporall life with eternall.
            
               Que. Yea but that is not his promiſe then, for his promiſe is long lyfe heere.
               
            
            
               Anſ. He that promiſeth monie, and giueth golde, breaketh not his promiſe: hee that promiſeth little and giueth much, breaketh not his promiſe: but ſo doeth the Lorde with vs, and therefore who is hee that vnthankefully pleadeth againſt his mercie?
            
               
               Que. What fruitfull notes nowe gather you of th
                        •
                     ſe wordes?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Firſt wee may note that the Lorde ioyning a promiſe of mercie to this commaundement, and not dealing ſo with anie thing which he liketh not, greatlie pleaſing out of queſtion in his ſight is the kéeping of this law: namelie when euerie man doeth dutie where dutie is due, and in loue we allow, cheriſh and maintaine one an other.
            Secondlie if long life bee a bleſſing promiſed to ſuch as obey their parents, and this obedience procéedeth greatly of good education, then they that careleſlie and vngodlily neglect the ſame in their children, doe aſmuch as lyeth in them ſhorten the dayes of their poſter
                  •
               tie.
            Laſtlie wee alſo in this promiſe annexed note, that if long life be a gift of God, then commeth it not by nature or good conſtitution of body, further or longer than it pleaſeth the ſame GOD to bleſſe the meanes, and graunt it. And thus much briefely of this commaundement.
            
               
               The Application.
               
                  NOwe remaineth it to applie theſe thinges to our ſelues, euerie one diſcloſing his life, and inward thoughtes before the Lord, and before our ſelues, as néere as we can, to the ende that ſight of ſin if it be foūd in vs, may bring foorth ſorowe: and giuen grace in ſome ſtrength to ſtande, if wee can finde we haue had it, may increaſe our thankes to the Lord our God, who did ſo aſſiſt vs. Let euerie one wey their calling and eſtate, ſée what of them in this lawe the Lorde requireth, and what of them in their places hath béene performed. Children in dutie ſubiect to our parents, we are, or haue béene euery one of vs. Haue we then euer doone it, or preſently doe wee in the true teſtimonie of a féeling conſcience reuerence in heart and by al outward ordinarie meanes thoſe ordained inſtruments by the Lord of ſo great

good vnto vs our naturall parentes? Neuer haue our hearts harbored any light or vnworthie thought of them or againſt them? Neuer haue wee failed in any outwarde geſture to teſtifie to the worlde our hidden loue and duetifull regarde of them? Can we ſay in truth, what of a child anie way ought to be, or (to mitigate ye matter a litle) what of vs poſſiblie could be performed in reſpect of age, of ſtrength, of abilitie, of time &amp; oportunitie, with ſuch like, that of vs hath béene doone euer fullie, and willinglie to them? O conſcience caſting in our téethes our corruption, thou accuſeſt vs. Theſe boyling harts not bearing iuſt reproofe, vndutifullie haue often, if we could remember it, repined at their authoritie, impatientlie fretted at their due correction, and the moſt of vs out of queſtion at one time or other, if we haue not openlie thrown out a curſe, yet haue our heartes included a wiſh, and wordes peraduenture vttered aſmuch, not conſonant euerie way with our dueties. Nay haue not euen outward violences béene offered

to them by vs? Ioyfull were the ſpeach to the Saintes in heauen, if in trueth wee all coulde aunſwere, no. But God knowes a guiltie minde in manie a one, doeth ſtoppe his ſpeach, and filthie fact to beate or wiſh to beate thē who brought him foorth, doeth crie to God without repentaunce for a plague. What ſhoulde I name, what ſhoulde I feare to name, ſo will it wring vs all, the mocking of our Parentes? Where is that childe that hath carefully couered to his power and euer borne withall in him ſelfe the wantes or infirmities whatſoeuer of his Parents? No, no, the Lord hath not onelie ſomething againſt vs in this behalfe, but euen great and gréeuous hath béene our fault and ſtill it remaineth in manie of vs. Wée laugh to ſée our Parentes ſhame, we ſmile at their wants, wee publiſhe their infirmities, we diſdaine their ignoraunce, wee loath their age, and in manie a thing to our owne confuſion, if the Lorde giue not an amending repentance, we bewray a robbed hart of yt true reuerēce which ought

to bee in children to their parentes. Alas if God iudge vs for our obedience, where are we? what witles wil erecteth a kingdome in vs? Howe cleaue wee to our ſelues in all matters, and thinke our owne direction beſt? Howe deſpiſe we
                     •
                   the counſell of our friendes, and caſt behinde vs their experience? Euerie ſonne and euerie daughter woulde rule their mariage wholie themſelues. And euen in euerie action, alas what diſobedience ſheweth it ſelfe in vs vnto our parentes? For mayntaynance which is the thirde braunch of

                  , before the Lorde. Rare is the man that hath imployed euerie abilitie of his wit, of wealth, of knowledge, of ſtrength at euerie néede to his parentes comfort. And therefore the Lord in 
                     〈◊〉
                   not in furie deale with vs as wee are children. Are we parents? th

                  ſe duties of our children might be 
                     〈◊〉
                   vnto vs euen in regarde of our behauiour. If not, then haue wee pulled

vpon vs the guilt of our childrens want of dutie being cauſes of the ſame, and the Lorde is angry with vs. What life haue wee ledde before our children to bréede and continue theſe duties in them? Hath it béene holy, graue, and modeſt, and ſo remayneth as néere as we can, ſéeking to hide from the eyes of their witleſſe heades, ſuch wantes as we knowe our ſelues ſubiect vnto? No no, but careleſly and looſely, euen in euery place, parentes bewray neglect of religion, they will goe to the Churches or good exerciſes when they liſt, and that verie rarely, they ſhewe no regarde of the dutie of Chriſtians, they carie no grauitie in their doinges, no modeſtie often in their behauiour, but liue moſt diſſolutely and often incontinently, they ſweare fearefully without regarde, ſpeake prophanely not reſpecting the frailtie of the youth that heareth them, father and mother let vnkinde ſpéeches paſſe from them one towardes an other in the preſence of their children, to the great impayring of their credite with them, careleſſe God knowes of their

bringing vp, and too full of fooliſh pitie when they ſhould correct them. All theſe are meanes to make the children faile in reuerence to their parentes, and to tempt them to ſinne. And therefore let vs looke if we be parentes, and gréeued with vnreuerent regarde in our children of vs, whether wee our ſelues be not cauſers of the ſame. Againe, for their obedience it faileth oft by fault in vs. For if we be Parentes, we lay great burdens vpon our children, preſſing them ſtill with our authoritie, we inioyne them what we liſt, not weying well what they can like, and not carefully conſidering aſwell their natures, as our owne deſires, aſwell their comfort and conuenient beeing, as our owne affection and will to haue it ſo, what maruell if often GOD breake our heartes with their diſobedience? The like may be ſaide of that thankefull maintaynaunce that ſhoulde of children to their Parentes be performed. The very vnnaturall and vnkinde dealing of Parentes with their children in

their youth, denying them reléefe, and comfortable helpe, maketh them often (though it ſhould not) when they haue attayned to anie eſtate, to deale as vndutifully with their néedie Parentes againe. Conſider therefore I ſay, if wee be Parentes, what cauſe we giue, and compare it with the fruite wee finde in our ſeede. Let ſinne appeare, if wee haue offended, and let the lawe condemne vs, if wee haue tranſgreſſed. For ſurely what duties this lawe bindeth all children to perfourme, it as ſtraitely bindeth all parentes to deſerue. The Parentes euill excuſeth not the childe, but it maketh him guiltie of his childes offence. Thus may the reſt alſo deſcende into themſelues. Too apparant is contempt in our liues of Magiſtracie and authoritie. Wee honour them not as Parentes, but both in reuerence, obedience, and maintaynance of their ſtate by retribution of ſome part of that wee haue got by them,

we bewray vngodlineſſe, and ſinne againſt the Lorde and them very gréeuouſly. For where is that heart that riſeth vp in thankefulneſſe for them to our God, that obeyeth them ſecretly aſwell as openly, for conſcience not for feare? Nay O ſin of ours, if it be ſought out by the Lorde in this reſpect, euen growen aſſuredly vp to heauen. For howe dare we and doe we defeate their lawes continually? Howe ſet wee our ſhiftes againſt the wiſedome and working of the Lorde by them? We mocke the Lorde and ſwell in pride againſt him. For be he as wiſe as he will in directing the Magiſtrate to a lawe to rule vs by, we ſhortly after wil be vp in wit againſt him to ſhake in péeces by a ſhift all his indeuour. Truely our heartes be dead, our ſinne is great, &amp; the Lorde hath wrath in ſtore, if this our dealing with our parentes be not confeſſed and amended. Thus deale we alſo with our miniſters and ſpirituall fathers begetting vs to the Lorde. With moſt vile vſage we often abuſe them, and if not, yet in heart at leaſt as the refuſe of the

worlde we eſtéeme them. Let God be iudge or our owne ſoules what baſe and ſcorneful concepts we harbour of them, and whether in trueth, as parentes they be loued, accompted of, and delt withall. What ſwelling pride in youth againſt the aged? What vngratefull handes and heartes againſt our great and gainefull friendes? Euerie way, euerie way guiltie we are of the breache of this commaundement, if wee can ſée it. Magiſtrates alſo, and miniſters euen aſmuch for their great offences in their callings, ſo that if in iuſtice we be repayed, ſhort ſhall our liues be heere on earth, and in the world to come eternall death. Who can ſay he hath doone the duties of a gouernour? who can ſay he hath liued lawefully as an inferiour? Alas we are touched all with ſinne, and robbed by it of all the bleſſing. Yet ſinne eſpied and truely loathed, findes euer pardon. For this cauſe Chriſt died, that we ſhould not be damned if we will be taught. Thinges paſt be gone, and the Lorde forgiue vs. Some be to come, and the Lorde ſtrengthen vs. Whether

we be parentes and haue not deſerued, or we be children, and haue not perfourmed, the Lorde hath mercie if we doe amende, the Lorde hath loue, if our liues doe ſéeke it, and iudgement alſo if perſwaſion profit not. Life doth he promiſe if we kéepe this lawe, and life will he giue vs, as hee is GOD, and true, both heere and euermore.
            
         
         
            The ſixt Commaundement.
            
               Thou ſhalt doe no murther.
            
            
               Queſtion.
            
            
               
                  HOw ſtandeth the order of this commandement?
            
            
               Anſ. Great wiſedome hath our God ſhewed euen in the order of euery one, and by name of this. For hauing in the

former eſtabliſhed degrées amongeſt men, ſome to rule and ſome to obey, if he ſhould not alſo haue ſet limittes for their authoritie, it had bene to arme iniuſtice, and to ſtrengthen oppreſſion and wrong.
            
               Que. What is the equitie of this lawe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. It is a verie iuſt lawe, and méete to bee eſtabliſhed and made in thrée reſpectes. Firſt in reſpect of God himſelfe, who louing all good preſeruation of life, goods, credite, &amp;c. and hating the contrarie, fitly prouideth to worke the ſame in men, whome he would haue holy as he is holie. Secondly in reſpect of man, for our brother is our owne fleſh, and wee come all of one roote, and therefore wee ſhoulde not kill. Laſtlie foraſmuch as the ſocietie and traficke of man with man cannot be, vnleſſe life may be in ſafetie, therefore euen in reſpect thereof alſo, méete it was that the Lord ſhould make this lawe, that we ſhould not kill.
            
               Que. Is all killing of anie thing

that hath life forbidden in theſe wordes of the lawe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No indéede, but if we would vnderſtande what notwithſtanding theſe wordes we may doe, wee muſt conſider that all liuing things are of thrée ſorts, either they are plantes, hearbes, trées, and ſuch like, or brute beaſtes, or reaſonable creatures. And al theſe in time, place, and for ſome cauſes we may kill notwithſtanding theſe wordes. For the firſt we haue our warrants in theſe wordes: I haue giuen you euerie hearbe bearing ſeede,
               
                  Gen. 1.29.
                
               which is vppon all the earth, and euerie tree wherein is the fruit of a tree bearing ſeede, that ſhall be to you for meate. For the ſeconde, Euery thing (ſaith God) that moueth and liueth ſhalbe meate for you,
               
                  Gen. 9.3.
                
               as the greene hearbe: I haue giuen you all thinges. For the thirde and laſt ſort, both the ſundrie commandementes of God in ſackages of cities to put to ſworde man, woman, and childe, prooue it, as alſo many his lawes made to that ende.
            
               Que. But may anie man ſhed mans bloud?
               
            
            
               
               Anſ. No, onely they haue lawefully ſhedde mans bloud, which haue had a calling of the Lorde to the ſame, as the Magiſtrate.
            
               Que. And what ſay you of the warriour?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Wee muſt comprehende him vnder the title of a Magiſtrat, for ſo indéede he is, if he be thereunto appointed. The calling alſo,
                  Luke. 3.
                
               Iohn Baptiſt approoueth in that his ſpéeche vnto the ſouldiers, whome hee doth not bidde to leaue that life, but to vſe it rightly, which yet he would not haue aduiſed them, if it had béene vngodly. Alſo in the goſpell Chriſt toucheth not the Centurion for his kinde of life,
                  Math. 8.
                neither Peter, Cornelius, who was a Captaine, or yet his meſſenger,
                  Act. 10.
                which was a Souldier. And I come vnto thee (ſayeth Dauid) in the name of the Lorde and bleſſed be the Lorde which teacheth my hands to warre and my fingers to fight.
               
                  Pſalm. 143.
               
            
            
               Que. Is onely the actuall killing of a man forbidden?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No, but euen aſwell alſo the

ordinarie forerunners of murther, to wit, fighting and quarrelling. For if a man cauſe anie blemiſh in his neighbour,
               
                  Leuit. 24.19.
                (ſayth the lawe) as he hath done, ſo ſhall it be doone vnto him. Eie for eie, tooth for tooth, hande for hande, foote for foote,
               
                  Exod. 21.24.25
                
               burning for burning, wounde for wounde, ſtripe for ſtripe. Whereby wee ſée plainely howe the GOD of heauen alloweth that hurting, and laming of our brethren in fight, which a fleſhly man taketh to be ſo lawefull, ſo glorious, and an argument of ſuch valure in him. And no doubt but this lawe of God thus executed vpon vs would quickly coole that raging heate within vs, which no counſell of our friendes, no conſideration of neceſſarie circumſtances, as of our calling, the place where we liue, the charge of wife, children, and ſuch like hanging vpon our ſafetie, the lawe of man, no nor the lawe of God it ſelfe condemning vs for it, can ſtaie or aſwage.
                  Math. 5.39.
                Againe, Reſiſt not euill, (ſayth the Lorde) but whoſoeuer ſhal ſmite thee on the right cheeke, turne

to him the other alſo: That is, be ſo farre from yéelding to the rage of thy affections, which prouoke thee to ſtrike againe, that euen rather thou be cōtent to take aſmuch more, than to diſpleaſe thy God, by vngodly and forbidden reuenge. And for quarrelling what a ſwéete and vehement perſwaſion is it of the Apoſtle againſt ſuch bitter words of a boyling and boyſterous heart? Now therefore (ſayth he) as the elect of God, holy, and beloued,
               
                  Coloſ. 3.13.
                
               put on tender mercie and kindeneſſe, humbleneſſe of minde, meekeneſſe, long ſuffering, forbearing one an other, and forgiuing one an other, if anie man haue a quarrell to an other, euen as Chriſt forgaue you, euen ſo doe yee. Hatefull therefore before God are as I ſay the ordinarie forerunners of murther, quarrelling and fighting with their fellowes whatſoeuer. And aſſuredly if the Lorde were in vs, as we thinke he is, that méeke ſpirite of his would kill more and more that fearefull haſtineſſe to reuenge that is euen in al, and we would learne of him,
                  Math. 11.25
                for hee is meeke and

lowly in heart.
            
               Que. What thinke you of killing by combat?
               
            
            
               Anſ. I muſt néedes thinke that the practiſe in a Chriſtian common wealth being naught and vnlawfull, the death that therby inſues, is horrible murther, and condemned in this commaundement. Nowe that to fight a combat in a godly ſtate is not tollerable, it may eaſily appeare if you weigh the cauſes for which it is at any time taken in hande. For if they be not (as it will appeare) ſufficient to warrant it, then is it not warrantable. The firſt cauſe that is alleadged for it, is to trie a trueth, which otherwiſe can not bee knowen ſay they. But it may bee anſwered that the ende good, doeth not by and by make the meanes good: to try out a trueth is good, but to try it with the hazarde of life, is more than can be warranted. There are manie lawefull meanes to finde out trueth by, and if all thoſe faile, then is it euident that the Lorde for ſome cauſe reſerueth it to himſelfe for a ſecret, and to ſéeke

importunately and impaciently by extraordinarie meanes (as a combat is) to finde it out, is to tempt the Lorde, and euen as it were by violence to draw from him the manifeſtation of ye which as yet he would not haue reueiled. Secondly the one partie is innocent, yet either of thē deſireth ye death of an other indifferently, ſo ye murder is in the hart of both of them, which amongeſt Chriſtians ſhoulde not be countenaunced. Sometimes the combat is craued for vaine oſtentation of corage &amp; ſtrength, many a Thraſo thinking his glorie to ſtande in the chalenging of an other to vngodlineſſe, but this I hope no man will ſay to be a good cauſe for a Magiſtrate to admit of a combat. Sometimes to auoyd or reuenge ſome great diſgrace offred to a man, he beggeth thus to fight. But a Chriſtian man that muſt make an accompt at the day of iudgement of his life giuen him from aboue, muſt learne to eſtéeme more of life, than honour, (if honour by lawefull meanes may not be kept) and more of God, and his commaundement, than of them

both. Beſides the profeſſion of a Chriſtian is to heare euill and to ſuffer euill though hee doe well, and deſerue ſo: therefore farre ſhould wee be from yéelding to ſuch heates. Some alleadge that it endeth ſtrife, and therefore is to be admitted: but to this may ſerue the aunſwere to the firſt cauſe alleadged for it. And beſides, who knoweth not that howeſoeuer it endeth it betwixt thoſe two, becauſe the one of them dyeth, yet layeth it the foundation of euen deadly hatred in the heartes of all their frindes, ſeede and poſteritie, ſo that for one which is killed there ſtarteth vp an hundred diſcontented heartes, ſéeking and following all occaſions of ſtrife againſt their enemies. Therefore in peace and at home howe a Chriſtian Magiſtrate may allowe the combat, wee finde no ſufficient cauſe and warrant. For the fielde yet ſome doe thinke it is méete, and that they haue reaſon for it, for ſay they when two armies are incamped

in battle together, if vppon cauſes it bee iudged fitte not to hazarde the loſſe of manie, but to committe it to two champions, either ſide agréeing to yéelde vppon the ouerthrowe of their man, who can miſlike this? But we anſwere that as yet the combat in it ſelfe is not prooued good, but is euill: and to doe euill that good may come of it, wee may not. Againe in ſuch a caſe as this, we muſt conſider, not onely of the men and their ſafetie, but alſo of the cauſe and his honeſtie. The cauſe is certainely either good or euill, either iuſt or iniuſt. If it bee good and iuſt, then is not the credite of it to bee layde vppon one man onelie to the mocking of iuſtice and right: and if it bee euill and vniuſt, then of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate not one mannes life is to be ſpent in it, and for it. Yea but ſay they yet further, the partie that hath the good cauſe is farre the weaker, and not able to ſtande if they

once ioyne all together, and therefore this other way of two to trie all, is good. And we anſwere alſo further, that this were a maruelous diſtruſt of Gods mercie and power not tollerable in a Chriſtian. For if the cauſe be good, and méete to be maintayned, then is the cauſe the Lordes, the men the Lordes, and hee ſaueth not by bowe nor ſpeare, nor by the multitude of an hoſte, ſo that wee ſhoulde ſo regarde theſe, but giueth victorie at his will to the weaker, and driueth away, as the winde the duſt, verie mightie force aſſembled againſt him, and his children. Therefore not euen yet doe I ſee a cauſe to beare out anie combat. If there be anie corruption in menne that iuſtice bee not doone (which ſometimes alſo is a cauſe alleadged) we muſt ſay as hee ſayde, committing our ſelues and our matter to GOD. 
                  Ʋideo, fero, ſpero, That is, I ſée, I ſuffer, I truſt in God. And euen with a good heart, be readie to beare any thing, rather than by a thing whereof I haue no

warrant, to ſéeke my ſatiſfaction.
            
               Que. Why? what ſay you then of Dauids act with Goliah?
               
            
            
               Anſ. I ſay it was an extraordinary motion in the hart of Dauid, wrought by the Lorde vppon the hearing of ſuch blaſphemie againſt God,
                  Num. 25. Exod. 32. 1. King. 18.
                and it may not bee our imitation, no more than the fact of Phinees, of the Leuites, or of Eliah which were all mere extraordinarie, and had their warrant by ſuch ſpecialtie from the Lorde as that others may not looke, it ſhall extend to them, if they doe the like.
            
               Que. What nowe of killing of our ſelues, is that neuer tollerable?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Much of this matter hath S. Auguſtine in his firſt booke of the city of God. And firſt he reaſoneth thus,
                  Chap. 1.
                If Iudas did euill in hanging himſelfe (which hee thinketh no man will denie) what may warrant anie man or woman to lay violent handes vppon themſelues?
                  Chap. 28.
                For neuer can anie fall in earth to a fowler fact, or to worſe eſtate in the eyes of God and man. Secondlie ſaith hee, the lawe ſaith not, Thou ſhalt not

kill thy neighbor, limiting it as it were to ſome, but indefinitelie, Thou ſhalt not kill, extending it largelie to all: and therefore ſaith he, not euen our ſelues may we make away. Thirdlie not Iob in all his extremitie durſt doe this whē as yet one pricke woulde haue finiſhed all his woe.
                  Chap. 24.
                And therefore no man may kill himſelfe.
            
               Que. Well, but yet becauſe you name Auguſtine, I haue heard of ſome cauſes propounded by him in this matter.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Truth it is, but none to ye warranting of this ſinne. For firſt ſaith hee, what if a woman do it to ſhunne pollution of her body, or after ſhée is polluted to flie the ignominie following vpon it? And he anſwereth to it, that the firſt is wicked and procéedeth of this error, that whatſoeuer is doone in vs, the ſame is alſo doone by vs, which is not ſo. For then were chaſtitie a vertue of the bodie and not of the mind. It is not for a chriſtian to ſay, this will I not ſuffer, but this wil I not do. The mind being ſtained ye body is filthie though it neuer did act, but not contrariwiſe: for the bodie

by violēce abuſed is neuer able to make guilty yt mind which cōſenteth not to it. And therfore this excuſe, ſaith Auſten can not warrant ſuch ſin as to kil ourſelues. For flying of ſhame which would follow ye fact, neither yet may it be doone. For the ſhame is not ſo great as the act, and therefore if the déed done vnto her may not warrant her, the ignominy following may not do it. Si non est impudica quae inuita comprimitur, non est illa iuſtitia qua caſta punitur. That is: If ſhe be not vnchaſt which vnwilling is oppreſſed, thē is it no iuſtice whereby the harmeles is puniſhed. Sed mulier auida laudis metuit, ne quod violenter paſſa eſt dum viueret, putaretur libenter paſſa ſi viueret.
                But ſaith he a woman that ſtandeth vpon ſpeach and praiſe reaſoneth with her ſelfe, that what ſhe ſuffered againſt her wil while ſhe liued, ſhe ſhould be thought to ſuffer with her wil, if ſhe liued. And therfore, ſhe wil kil her ſelfe. Indéede ſo may a womā reaſon ye regardeth more man thā God, but ye chriſtian guided with ye ſpirit that Dauid had, learneth to ſay with him: O god thou knoweſt mine innocencie, &amp;c. And

to reſt in ioy of ſpotleſſe minde whatſoeuer the worlde ſpeaketh. Then goeth hee further, and they will aunſwere ſaith hee, what can they tell howe they may be tempted to conſent by long importunitie or by ſight of hard extxemity, and therefore they will prouide before hand, leaſt they ſhould offend, and they wil kill thēſelues. O ſaith Auſten, what a ſpeach is this? Iam nunc peccemus, ne postea forte peccemus; iam nunc perpetremus certum homicidium, ne poſtea incidamus in incertum adulterium. That is, Let vs nowe ſinne, leaſt hereafter wee doe ſinne: let vs now commit certaine murder leaſt wee fall hereafter into vncertayne adulterie. Let vs nowe doe that which wee cannot liue to repent, leaſt hereafter wee doe, what we may repent, &amp;c.
            
               Que. But indeede is it not a vile thing to fall into the handes of mine enemie?
               
            
            
               Anſ. In déed Cato an heathen with manie other could not abide it, neither Saul a caſt away coulde ſuffer it. But better is the warrant euer of this ought

to be done, than of this is doone: &amp; therefore we muſt not weygh the latter, but the former. And we ſée neither Patriarches, Prophetes, nor Apoſtles euer to haue doone it. Nay ſaith Chriſt, When they perſecute you in one Citie, flie into an other. Where he might haue ſaide, diſpatch your ſelues, leaſt your enimies triumph ouer you. Nowe if they might not doe it, for whom euerlaſting manſions in heauen were prouided, what care we for a thouſande examples of infidels and Paganes? Thus then I conclude that neither for theſe cauſes alleadged, nor anie other whatſoeuer, wee may violentlie deale with our ſelues and ende our life.
            
               Que What if wee neither kill others nor our ſelues, but yet peraduenture cō
                     ſent?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Euen that conſent of heart is horrible murther &amp; condemned in this lawe. Herodias as guiltie for conſenting to the death of Iohn Baptiſt, and ſéeking it, as if ſhée had hewed off hys heade her ſelfe. Haman as guiltie for Mardocheus, as if he had doone it: Dauid
               
for Vrias, Ieſabel for Naboth, Pylate for Chriſt, as if they themſelues had béene executioners.
            
               Que. Often alſo haue I hard men ſay yt ſorow and care wil ſhorten our time.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Indéed it is not mans ſpeach only, but euen ye doctrine of the ſpirit of God.
                  Prou. 17.22.12.25.
                For a ioyfull hart, ſaith Salomon, cauſeth good health, &amp; a ſorowful mind, drieth the bones. Heauineſſe in the heart of man bringeth it downe, but a good word reioyceth it, yea a ioyfull hart maketh a cheereful countenance,
               
                  15. v. 13.
                
               &amp; by the ſorow of the hart, ye mind is heauie. This doctrine of god hath man by experience found euer ſo true, yt when any of thē in their writings haue ſpoken of care &amp; ſorow, they haue giuē vnto thē the epithites of biting, eating, conſuming care, &amp; ſuch like, becauſe in déed they haue that worke in thoſe yt are too much ſubiect to them. Galen the Prince of Phiſitions in his booke of the preſeruation of health, affirmeth plainly that cares doe pull on and haſten many diſeaſes in vs. Ariſtotle a Philoſopher ſaith that ſorowe drieth &amp; waſteth that naturall heat in vs,

wherein our life conſiſteth, and ſo as it were giueth a reaſon of Galens aſſertiō. No doubt the thing is true tryed and found to their harme in thouſands. And therfore euē in this reſpect muſt a chriſtian beware leaſt the Lord haue againſt him in the day of iudgement, yt he ſhortned his owne life by ſuffering vncomfortable ſorowe to lie ſnubbing &amp; chéecking his hart within both day &amp; night. Alas, what is it that euer happen to that man or woman in earth, which taſt the mercie of God in Chriſt Ieſus towardes them ſo bitter, as that it may not be delaied, and comforted euen with this, that God is on their ſide,
                  Rom. 8.
                &amp; who or what can be againſt them? Doth not euerie thing, yea euen euery thing happen for the beſt to thoſe that loue God? Haue a true hart, and meane not falſely, and then ſay in faith as Dauid doth My helpe commeth of God which preſerueth them that are true of heart. Yea,
                  Pſal. 7.11.
                let me ſay to all that euer ſhall reade this in the name of the Lorde of heauen, when cauſe of humilitie happeneth, differre not to be humbled, harden

not your hearts in the day of affliction, but ſacrifice them vp bruſed and troubled to the LORD,
                  O Lord helpe. Omnes cum valemus, &amp;c.
                yet euer ſo farre yéelde to ſorowe, as that you conſtantlie and euen chéerefullie holde that which followeth in the Prophet, a broken and contrite heart is neuer deſpiſed. And therfore whatſoeuer the matter is, with Dauid vnto your ſad ſoule in euerie corner crie:
                  Pſal. 42.
                
               Why art thou ſo ſad, O my ſoule,
               
                  Pſal. 27. vlt.
                
               and why art thou ſo diſquieted in mee? Still truſt in God, ſtill truſt in God, for I will yet thanke him, hee is the helpe of my countenaunce and my God. Thus tarrie ye the Lordes leaſure, be ſtrong and he ſhall comfort your heart, and put your truſt in the Lorde.
            
               Que. Thus then hauing ſpoken of actuall murder or murder of the hande, as wee ſay, together with the braunches thereof, proceede if you thinke good to the murder of the tongue.
               
            
            
               Anſ. That euen by the tongue alſo this commaundement is broken, it is euident by the teſtimonie of our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, who expounding this law in the fift of Matthew,
               
                  Math. 5.
                concludeth

them in it that ſay Racha, or thou foole to their brethren, that is, that by bitter and vncomelie ſpeaches ſhewe their heartes to bee robbed of loue, and to lodge an vnlawful affection towards them.
            Secondly the compariſons which the ſcripture vſeth of the tongue, proueth plainely there is a murder by the tong. It compareth it to poyſon, to fire, to ſpeares, to ſharpe arrowes, and manie ſuch things, and al to teach that as theſe are the inſtrumentes of murder, ſo is the tongue.
                  Pſa. 14. Iam. 3. Pſal. 56. Pſal. 120.
                Wherefore iuſtlie prayeth Dauid in his Pſalme, O Lorde deliuer mee from lying lippes, &amp; from a deceitfull tongue. Iuſtly pronounceth he the curſe of God vpon it in an other place, ſaying that the Lorde ſhall roote out all deceitfull lippes,
                  Pſal. 1 20.
                and Salamon alſo flatlie affirmeth, that, he which hath a naughtie tongue ſhall fall into euill.
               
                  Prou. 17.20.
                Maruellous me thinke is alſo the diſcourſe of that wiſe mā 
               Syrach touching this matter, and to bee carefully weyed. Abhorre, ſaith he,
                  Chap. 28.
                
               the ſlaunderer &amp; double tongued, for ſuch haue deſtroyed

manie that were at peace. The double tong hath diſquieted manie and driuen them from nation to nation: ſtrong cities hath it broken downe, and ouerthrowen the houſes of great men: the ſtrength of the people hath it brought downe, and beene the decay of mightie nations: the double tong hath caſt out many vertuous women, and robbed them of their labours. Who ſo hearkeneth vnto it ſhal neuer finde reſt neither euer dwel quietly. The ſtroke of the rod maketh markes in the fleſh, but the ſtroke of the tong breaketh the bones. There be many that haue periſhed by the edge of the ſword, but not ſo many as haue fallē by ye tong. Wel is him that is kept frō an euill tong, and commeth not in the anger thereof, which hath not drawen in that yoke, neither hath bin bound in the bands therof. For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, &amp; the bands thereof are bondes of braſſe. The death thereof is an euil death, &amp; hell were better than ſuch one. With moe ſuch ſpeaches in that chapter if you read it ouer. And in an other place, Who ſhal ſet a watch before my mouth,
               
                  Chap. 22.26.
                
               and a

ſeale of wiſedome vppon my lippes, that I fall not ſoudenly by them, and that my tong deſtroy me not? Feareful therefore is the fault of the tongue as we plainly ſée.
            
               Que. Howe doe men vſe to kill by their tongues.
               
            
            
               Anſ. By ſlaunders, reproches, mocks and tauntes, ſaith your booke, and conſider indéede the diſpleaſure of God againſt all theſe: as againſt the firſt by an expreſſe lawe againſt it: Thou ſhalt not walke about with tales among the people, meaning, as ſlaunderers,
                  Leuit. 19.16.
                backbiters and quarrell pickers doe. Alſo by the hatred of it which the ſpirite of God worketh againſt it in the godlie,
                  Pſalm. 101.
                as in Dauid, who ſaith hee will deſtroy the vngodlie ſlaunderer which priuilie ſlandereth his neighbour,
                  Leuit. 19.14.
                in Salomon who counſelleth in anie caſe to refraine harkening to them, and in many others. Againſt the ſeconde by his lawe alſo publiſhed in that behalfe: that we ſhoulde not curſe the deafe, neither put a ſtumbling blocke before the blinde, that is, no waye reproche them with

their infirmitie, but feare the Lord, for hee is our God, as though he ſhould ſay, reproches of our brethren, and to feare the Lorde, are neuer in one man together. And it is a ſpeach worthie noting, of the wiſe Syrach,
               
                  Syrach. 22.20. &amp;c.
                That whoſo caſteth a ſtone at birdes frayeth them away, and he that vpbraideth his friend, breaketh friendſhip. Yea marke what followeth, though thou dreweſt a ſword ſaith hee, at thy friend, yet diſpaire not, for there may bee a returning to fauor. If thou haue opened thy mouth againſt thy friend, feare not, for there may bee a reconciliatiō: but if vpbraiding, or pride or diſcloſing of ſecreates, or a traiterous wound do let, then by theſe thinges, euerie friende will depart. And againe, in an other place:
                  Chap. 23.15.
                the man that is accuſtomed to opprobrious words wil neuer be reformed al the daies of his life.
            
               Que. Horrible I ſee then it is either to ſlander or to reproch any with ſuch infirmities as they haue, but a mocke I take not to be in ſo high a degree.
               
            
            
               Anſ. What degrée ſo euer it is in, it ſkilleth not, certaine &amp; ſure it is, that God

abhorreth it. And I refer but anie hart yt hath féeling to the firſt words of Dauid in his Pſalme,
                  Pſalm. 1.
                
               Bleſſed is that man yt hath not ſit in the ſeate of the ſcorneful. I beſéech you if they be bleſſed that haue not done it, what are they that daily doe it? The wicked thought of a foole is ſin,
               
                  Prou. 24.9.
                
               &amp; the ſkorner is an abomination to men, ſaith Salomon. Yea ſcornfull men bring a citie into a ſnare, hee that rebuketh a ſcorner purchaſeth to himſelfe ſhame,
               
                  29.8.
                
               &amp; he that rebuketh the wicked getteth a blot. Rebuke not a ſcorner leaſt he hate thee, but rebuke a wiſe man, and he will loue thee.
               
                  9.7. &amp; 8.
                Wherefore not without reaſon ſéemeth the tranſlation of Hierom, and the Gréekes of the Hebrewe worde Lezim mockers, into peſtilentes, peſtilent fellowes and hurtfull, for ſo they are in déede, euen the plagues of a common weale. Yet if we marke the vſuall cauſe of mocks it wil make vs ſée more into the vilenes of this ſin. For it is euer lightly for doing wel, &amp; refraning euel yt the wicked mocke the godly, &amp; is it not a vile ſpirit yt cannot abide vertue, but ſo gréedily thirſteth after vice? Drink

not with ye drunkers til thou bee drunke, and they mocke thee
                     •
                   ſweare not with the ſwearers, but admoniſh them, and they mocke thee. Be not vaine in words, in apparel, in behauiour, and they mocke thee. Heare the word, reade the word, talke of the worde, and by and by, O young ſaint, olde diuell, you wil to heauen or your bones be cold, with a number ſuch mockes and diueliſh tauntes. The degrées be diuers, yet all diueliſh, ſome ſcorne all admonition, and they woulde haue euerie fat, they ſay, ſtand on his owne bottome, and euerie mā to medle with himſelf. Some ſcorne, but at that which toucheth themſelues, ſhooting out their lippes, &amp; refuſing to be charmed. Some ſecretlie in hearts by a moſt contemptuous concept of that good thing whatſoeuer, which their crooked natures cannot like of, others openly by verie vile ſpeaches vttered againſt God and godlineſſe, againſt their brethren, and what graces God hath giuen them. But it is a ſealed trueth, &amp; god giue vs harts to cōſider it wel. Iudgmēts are prepared for ye ſcorner,
               
                  Prou. 19.29.
                
               &amp; ſtripes

for the backe of the foole. Michall Dauids wife a mocking miſtreſſe out of her gaſing windowe not ſparing her owne huſbande the king of a frumpe, and that in a good thing, found the rewarde of it at the Lorde, ſhée was curſed as barren while her life indured, and neuer had children. Thoſe mocking children at the baldneſſe of the Prophet, felt the rewarde of ſuch a ſinne. For our example the Lorde cauſed Beares to deuour them all preſentlie. Semei that ſcorned the eſtate of Dauid,
               
                  2. Kings 2.
                went not to his graue in peace. Bician that ſcoffer, was deuoured of dogges, as they write. And as yet neuer ſcaped the vnrepenting ſcorner the handes of the Lorde. For howe ſhoulde it ſtande with his iuſtice, to call vs to a reckning for our idle wordes, and not for our mockes and vngodlie tauntes? Wherefore trueth it is, and ſhall euer ſtande: Bleſſed is that man that hath not ſit in the ſeate of the ſcornefull.
            
            
               Que. Why but may we not ieſt merily one with an other?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Yes indéede, for all ieſting is not

mocking ſuch as nowe we haue ſpoken of and ſhewed to bee euill. Merilie, if you remember, did the Prophet Eliah ieſt with the Idolaters &amp; worſhippers of Baal, bidding them crie lowd, for their god paraduēture might be talking with ſome body,
                  1. King. 28.
                or purſuing his enimies, or in ſome iornie ſome whither, or paraduenture a ſléepe. Thus ſaith the text, did Eliah mocke them, &amp; yet this mocking being but a pleaſāt ieſting to haue taught them good if they had had grace, diſpleaſed not the Lord. An other example alſo we haue in the prophet Eſay laughing as it were at their follie who wold worſhip that as God the chippes whereof had made them ſuch a fire yt they cryed A,
               
                  Eſay. 44.
                
               ha, I am well warmed. And for ye place to the Epheſians it condemneth not this maner of ſpeaking and ieſting,
                  Ephe. 5.
                but that which procéedeth either of a vaine deſire to ſhew our ſelues, or of an vngodly coueting to ſting our brethren.
            
               Que. Thus then I ſee the malice of the tongue to be great and euen al men by it to be made guilty of this cōmandement, though their handes neuer ſhed bloode:

yet is it ſuch a miſchiefe as the godlie are much ſubiect to, I meane to be ſtinged with the tongues of the wicked: and therefore I pray you if you knowe anie giue me ſome counſell howe to thinke of this croſſe.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Truth it is, that howſoeuer the ſinne be great to mocke, or to ſpeake againſt any deſpitefully, and eſpecially the godly, yet is it a croſſe vſually incident to them that will ſeparate the ſinnes of this worlde, ſo néere as they can from their liues, to be taunted and ſpoken againſt, by both open deſpiſers of goodneſſe, and by open profeſſors alſo of religion. And that comfort which I knowe, is to thinke euen often and ſeriouſly of theſe, and ſuch other places. The mouth of the wicked,
               
                  Pſal. 109.2.
                
               &amp; the mouth full of deceit are opened vpon me (ſaith Dauid.) They haue ſpoken to me with a lying tongue, they compaſſed me about alſo with wordes of hatred, and fought againſt mee without a cauſe. For my friendſhippe they were mine aduerſaries. But I gaue my ſelfe to prayer. Sée the refuge of this ſaint of God in this

kinde of croſſe, euen to heauen: marke the reſt of his conſcience, euen the Lord, and if euer the like caſe be ours, let vs powre with him our guiltleſſe gréefe into the boſome of our God, and there an ende, till the Lorde thinke good to make our trueth appeare alſo to men. The like ſpéeche and practiſe note againe in an other place of the ſame booke. Princes (ſayth he) did ſit and ſpeake againſt me,
               
                  Pſal. 119.23.
                
               but thy ſeruant did meditate in thy ſtatutes. And againe, The proude haue had mee exceedingly in deriſion, yet haue I not ſhrinked from thy commaundementes.
               
                  Ver. 51.
                And what a ſpéech is it of Paule to the Corinthians? I take pleaſure in infirmities,
               
                  2. Cor. 12.10.
                
               in reproches, &amp;c. Wherefore in God reioyce, who ſeeth the heart yt meant no harme: in the Lord be chéerefull, whoſe mercy turneth the deſerued croſſe of many gret greefes into the biting but of a peuiſh tongue, and in pacience paſſing the time on, ſay in faith, what many haue ſaide in folly: That time ſhall trie the trueth.
            
               Que. Yet there are ſome mo branches of this murther of the tongue.
               
            
            
               
               Anſ. Indéede by the tongue alſo no doubt they kill, who by cruell counſell ſtirre vp the hating heartes of men to any bloudie perſecution, or which with their mouthes witneſſe an vntruth, to the ende to ſhedde any bloud thereby, as did the iudges of Suſanna, and as many conſcienceleſſe men in theſe daies doe, being vpon an inqueſt of life and death, to be maiſters of their will.
            
               Que. Now if you thinke good, a litle alſo of the third kind of murder, namely, of the heart, and firſt how it is prooued?
               
            
            
               Anſ. The words of our ſauiour Chriſt are plaine,
                  That there is a murther of the heart.
                that out of the heart come euill thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murthers. Therefore there is a murder of the heart. Againe, S. Iohn ſaith, Whoſoeuer hateth his brother is a manſleaer. But hatred is in the hart, and therefore manſlaughter. Thirdly the minde and the wil being ye beginnings or the fountains of al actions if they be infected, the man muſt nedes be gilty before ye Lord.
            
               Que. Doth this fearefull ſinne ſtep into the heart at firſt, or it creepeth rather by degrees as other great ſinnes doe?
               
            
            
               
               Anſ. Sathan is more ſubtle than ſo, to drawe euerie man to the extremitie of ſinne at the firſt, and therefore howſoeuer in ſome men he doth vpon a ſodaine, yet ordinarily this murther ſtealeth into our heartes by theſe ſteps. Firſt Satan brée
                  •
               eth by his vnmarked créeping into our affections a miſliking of ſuch a man or woman, and yet wee well knowe not why, but we can not like them. Then doeth this miſliking bréede anger. For we cannot beare at their handes, that which wee can well ſuffer at others. Anger bréedeth hatred, hatred deſire of reuenge, and deſire of reuenge murther. Thus ſtealeth ſinne into vs, and by theſe ſteppes. Therefore firſt euerie Chriſtian is to take héede howe miſliking of any groweth vppon him,
                  Miſliking.
                and to ſnubbe the courſe of Sathan at the firſt. Secondly to looke the fruite thereof, namely, anger, weying well what was ſaide to Caine,
               
                  Gen. 1.6.
                
               Caine why art thou angry? And by our Sauiour Chriſt in the goſpell,
                  Math. 5.
                
               But I ſay vnto you whoſoeuer is angry with his brother vnaduiſedly,
               
                  Anger.
                
               ſhalbe culpable of iudgement,
               
expounding there this commandement, and including as you ſee anger in it. And hence haue growen all thoſe vehement ſpéeches in the ſcriptures againſt it. Let all bitterneſſe and anger, and wrath be put away from you,
               
                  Epheſ. 
                        •
                     .31.
                
               and be ye curteous one towardes an other, and tender hearted, forgiuing one an other, euen as God for Chriſtes ſake forgaue you (ſaith the Apoſtle). And againe, Be ſlowe to wrath, ſaith an other.
                  Iam. 4.19.
                For the wrath of man doeth not accompliſh the righteouſneſſe of God: That is, anger and wrath hindreth Gods worke in vs. Vnto which and a number ſuch other perſwaſions in the worde the prophane writers by the verie light of reaſon haue agréeed, and ſought in their ſort to giue men a ſight of this foule vice. Anger haue they ſaide is the beginning of madneſſe, anger is the drunkenneſſe of the minde, anger admitteth not anie good counſell, anger is the roote of murther and death, with a number ſuch ſpéeches.
            
               Que. Foule then I ſee is this vice in all, and eſpecially in a Chriſtian: and

therefore it were good we knewe howe to auoide it.
               
            
            
               Anſ. We reade that a king of Thracia being preſented with a ſort of verie fine glaſſes, by and by brake them all in péeces. And being aſked the reaſon, anſwered, that hee did it to auoyde the wrath that hee was ſure would be in him againſt them that ſhould breake them afterwarde. Howe then are we taught by this king, though not euerie way to doe as hee did, yet with him to bee carefull to preuent our anger by taking away the occaſion? The occaſions of anger in manie men are plaie, and gaming, curioſitie in dealing and medling, taking a matter as they thinke they heard it, when indéede they heard it not right, nipping woordes, and gawling ſpéeches, with a number ſuch: which if men will not haue anie care to eſchewe, then in vaine doe they ſay they are afraide to let murther into their heartes. For in truth the effectes will followe if the ordinarie cauſes doe goe before.
            
               
               Que. Why but is all anger forbidden 
                        •
                     o a Chriſtian?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No indéede, it is as lawfull for a man in time, place, in his office, &amp; for a iuſt cauſe to be angry in a conuenient meaſure, as it is vnlawfull otherwiſe. And it is apparant by the children of God, in all ages, the Patriarkes, Prophetes, Apoſtles, and others, whoſe hearts haue burned with miſliking of euill, and wordes bewrayed aſmuch vnto them. Wherefore truly was it ſayd of the godly father, Nolle iraſci, vbi iraſcendum eſt, nolle emendare peccatum eſt. That is, for a man not to be angrie, whē he ſhould be angry, is as much as to be vnwilling to amend what is amiſſe.
            
               Que. Proceede nowe I pray you to the other branches.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Anger as was ſaide, begetteth hatred, nay becommeth hatred if it be let to ſettle. For Odium est inueterata ira: Hatred is nothing elſe but olde anger. And therefore ſince anger is apparantly forbidden in this commandement, hatred by conſequence being feſtred anger muſt néedes be much more.

Beſides wee haue heard the wordes of the ſcripture plaine, He that hateth his brother is a manſleaer.
               
                  1. Iohn. 5.
                Therfore I paſſe it ouer and come to the fellowe that is euer ioyned with it, when it méeteth with a fit ſubiect, to wit, Enuie, a vice compounded of the hatred of an other for vertue,
                  Enuie what it is.
                guiftes, fauour, honour, and ſuch like, and of ſelfe loue which maketh vs gréeue to ſée our ſelues in theſe thinges excelled of him. A vice alſo of the ſpirite of God by name forbidden. Eate not the meate (ſayth Solomon) of him that hath an euill eie,
               
                  Prou. 23.6.
                
               neither deſire his dainties. Let vs not be deſirous of vaine glorie (ſayth the Apoſtle) prouoking one an other,
               
                  Galat. 5.26.
                
               enuying one an other. But laying aſide all maliciouſneſſe, all guile and diſſimulation, all enuie and euill ſpeaking,
               
                  1. Pet. 2.1.

plagued her. Corah and his companie enuied him alſo, and the Lorde as abhorred, made the earth to ſhrinke, and ſwallowe them vp quicke, with all that they poſſeſſed. Saul had an eie vpon Dauid, for the womens ſinging, and it ſtirred him ſtill to ſéeke the life of his ſonne and ſeruant. Ioſephs brethren enuied him, and it almoſt brought them to his bloudſhedding. Euerie way therfore is enuie in a Chriſtian poyſon, and apparantly it falteth againſt this commaundement. It is a poſſeſſion beſides that deſtroyeth the poſſeſſour. For as the ruſt the iron, and mothes a garmen, ſo eateth vppe enuie the man that enuieth. Theſe thinges make enuie loathſome ynough to a godly minde, and yet is there more to bee ſayde againſt it. For beſides all this, enuie, as it wiſheth an other mans fall, ſo doth it reioyce if it happen vnto him. Which alſo is a thing verie horrible in the eyes of God. For hee that mocketh the poore (ſayth Salomon) reprocheth him that made him:
               
                  Prou. 17.5.
                
               and hee that reioyceth at deſtruction,

ſhall not be vnpuniſhed. Againe, Bee thou not glad, when thine enemie falleth,
               
                  24.18.
                
               and let not thy heart reioyce, when hee ſtumbleth, leaſt the Lorde ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and he turne his wrath from him to be auenged of thee. To the which wordes of Salomon howe conſonant was the practiſe of Iob teſtified in that moſt excellent ſpéeche of his: If I reioyced at his deſtruction that hateth me,
               
                  Iob. 31.
                (ſayeth be) or was mooued to ioye when euill came vpon him: If I ſuffred my mouth to ſinne by wiſhing a curſe vnto his ſoule, &amp;c. Meaning that hee neuer did it, neither would doe. For it is a fearefull ſinne. Calamitas illius fores pulſat qui aliorum calamitatibus non mouetur. That is, Miſerie knocketh at his dore of right, whoſe heart ſorroweth not to ſee others in aduerſitie. And neuer obiect his harde happe to any man could the Gréeke Oratour ſay, for fortune is common to all, &amp; what is to come, is not yet ſéene. Therefore euen this companion of enuie maketh it worſe, as I hope wée ſée, and of all that woulde

pleaſe the Lorde more carefullie to bee ſhunned. To reioyce at the ſinnes of an other much more muſt bee gréeuous, if his worldlie eſtate may not be reioyced at that it is euill. Beſides when by ſinne the Lorde is gréeued, and my brother wounded to eternall death, what a ſpirite were it to reioyce? Againe conſider our ſelues in compariſon with them that offende, and either we are better, like, or worſe: the two later giue no cauſe of ioy, and the former ſhould fill our heart with praiſe for our grace giuen of God, and not our mouthes with mockes at the infirmitie of others.
            
               Que. What elſe is forbidden?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Laſt of all, as the murther of the heart is forbidden all crueltie and hearde dealing with our brethren, for euen this the Lorde abhorreth alſo.
                  Deutr. 2
                        •
                     .
                The lawe that was made of fortie ſtripes to be giuen to an offender, and not aboue, did euidentlie drawe to ſome pitifull feeling our cruell, raging, and fierce affections. The 
                  •
               awe for widowes that they ſhould not

be wronged, and for the fatherleſſe that they ſhould not be forſaken, ſhotte at the ſame marke. So did the forbidding of vſurie to the poore, the taking of his rayment to pledge, the detayning of his hire, &amp; ſuch like thinges. All were to worke ſome mercie in vs towardes others, and to tell vs plainely that the Lorde abhorreth cruelty towardes anie.
            
               Que. Thus then if you thinke good, let it ſuffice to haue ſpoken of theſe three ſortes of murther, to wit, of the hande, the tongue, and the heart, together with their branches: and nowe a litle of the affirmatiue part of this commandement if you will.
               
            
            
               Anſ. The affirmatiue part of it eaſily may be knowen by the negatiue. For who ſeeth not that if generally all hurting or taking away of life (vnleſſe it be by the Magiſtrate lawefullie) be forbidden, then generally alſo is commaunded all care and preſeruation of the ſame:
                  Deutr. 19.20.
                and if in ſpecialitie the bitterneſſe of the tongue bee forbidden, then is the ſwéeteneſſe, the ſoftneſſe,

and the comfort of the ſame commaunded. If anger be forbidden, gentleneſſe is commaunded: if miſliking, hatred, enuie, and ioying at other mens harmes be forbidden, then is an heart well thinking and accepting of others commaunded, then is loue and a true reioycing at the good happes of our brethren commended: and to conclude, if all crueltie, rigor, and extremitie bee forbidden, then is all lenitie, mercie, and pitie commaunded. All which are vertues of great praiſe, and afording large perſwaſions vnto our heartes, to loue and like them, to embrace and followe after them. But ſo ſhoulde I dwell too long in this commaundement. The blackneſſe of their oppoſite vices I hope doeth make their beautie and brightneſſe great before our eyes. Onelie I wiſhe vs, to the ende wee may abounde in all mercie, that wee would often conſider that comfortable ſpéech of the Lorde by his prophet:
                  Eſay. 58.10.
                
               If thou refreſh the hungrie and troubled ſoule, then ſhall thy light ſpring out of darkeneſſe, the Lorde ſhall ſatisfie thy ſoule

in drought, and make fatte thy bones, and thou ſhalt be like a ſpring of water, whoſe water faileth not. As alſo that ſentence which at the daie of dayes ſhall be pronounced vppon it, Come, come yee bleſſed of my father, and poſſeſſe the kingdome prepared for you:
               
                  Math. 25.
                
               for when I was hungrie yee fedde me, when I was thirſtie you gaue me drinke, when I was naked yee clothed mee, when I was ſicke yee viſited mee, and ſo foorth. Both which places with manie moe to the ſame ende beeing often thought vpon, will ſoften our heartes in all dealinges with our brethren, and make vs profitable to them euer to our powers. And yet (which I had almoſt forgotte) it is not ynough for vs to doe good, to be kinde, and to ſhewe mercie, but wee muſt doe it alſo ſpéedily, readilie, and fitlie, that is, when the néede of our brethren requireth it, obſeruing carefullie all occaſions. For as it is ſayde of guiftes, that qui cito dat, bis dat, he that giueth a thing quickly, giueth it twiſe,
               
ſo is it of all thinges we doe, to helpe in time is a double helpe, and a benefite hauing loſt the oportunitie of our brothers néede, looſeth his welcome. Wherefore Iob profeſſeth that he had not cauſed the eyes of the widowe to faile in long looking for his helpe.

               Que. What puniſhment hadde the breach of this commandement?
               
            
            
               Anſ. The ſpirituall puniſhment of it, as of all other ſinnes, is eternall damnation both of bodie and ſoule. For without ſhall be dogges,
               
                  Apoc. 22.15.
                
               inchaunters, whoremungers, murtherers, &amp;c. (ſayeth S. Iohn): the temporall puniſhment of it was amongeſt the Iewes by the lawe of God bloud for bloud,
                  Gen. 9. Leuit. 24.
                and before the lawe by expreſſe wordes, vnleſſe in ſuch caſes as the cities of refuge were ordayned for. And euen as it were aboue all other ſinnes it is worthie marking howe euer the iudgement of GOD hath not ſuffered this ſinne to lie vnknowen or vnpuniſhed.

All ſtories be full of examples,
                  Phocas. Boniface. 7. Alexander. 6. Ethelbert. Richard. 3.
                and euerie man almoſt in his owne dayes, hath knowen ſome experience. Hotte is the wrath of the Lorde againſt this ſinne, and his mercie therefore euer kéepe vs from it.
            
               The Application.
               
                  WIth what wordes nowe ſhould I wiſh euerie one to deſcende into themſelues, and to take a view of their eſtate before the Lorde, touching this commaundement? Manie branches of it haue béene layde before vs, and what branch is it which we haue not broken being narrowly ſifted by the Lorde? The murther of the hande, I knowe wilbe our inſtance: but alas, howe many thinges make men guiltie in this? If euer in ſeruice againſt the enimie wee haue paſſed the bounds of a Chriſtian heart, in cruelly murdering concerning the maner, who

yet might haue died reſpecting the matter, we are guiltie and ſpotted before the Lorde. If women and children, aged and impotent, ſicke and diſeaſed that caried no weapon againſt our cauſe haue not ſo farre foorth béene regarded of vs and ſpared, yea defended by vs from our féercer felowes as by right we might, our handes haue faulted &amp; our loue hath wanted to the life of our brethren. If cruellie wee haue wiſhed, but in our inwarde heartes any diſorderlie and vnmercifull ſpoyle of our foes in féelde, we haue ſinned certainly in ſo doing. For euen the ſpoyle that a Chriſtian ſouldier maketh of his enimies in the warres ſhould ſauour of the mercifull nature, ſo néere as he can of that God whome he profeſſeth. If we haue béene euer as you hearde, but any occaſion of the death of any, either preſent, or ſpéedier than otherwiſe it wold haue béene, or of the ſhortening of our owne health, life, and abilitie by intemperancie, incontinencie, or anie meanes whatſoeuer, the iuſtice of our vndefiled God doth find it out, and we haue ſinned

againſt him in this thing. Where thē is our righteouſnes, but euē in this branch of actual &amp; hand murder? for ye tong what ſhould I ſay? Doth no mans hart accuſe him of vnrighteouſnes? Haue we neuer paſſed any ſpiteful ſlander, to the hurt of thē whom we ſhould haue loued? Deniall of it can neuer hide it, but confeſſion of it hath mercie promiſed. The name peraduēture of ſlander is odious to vs, &amp; we hardly can accuſe our ſelues of ſo foule a vice.
                     Slander.
                   Well then, let him change his cote, but remaine ye ſame mōſter ſtil. Haue we neuer reported any vnknowē thing to ye harme of our brethren? Neuer whiſpered that matter in ye eare of an other againſt any body, which yet if it had bin mine owne offence, I woulde willingly haue wiſhed conceiled &amp; couered? Hath this hart of mine caried euer ye loue in this reſpect, &amp; that true tender regard of my brothers credit ye poſſibly it might, or of duty it ſhould? O the God of gods be mercifull vnto vs, and deale not with vs according to our ſinnes, neither euer reward vs according to our iniquities. For I am ſure I may ſpeake it

in truth, &amp; yet in ſorow againſt all fleſh yt liueth, we are guilty, we are faulty in this behalfe. We ſnub not our heartes when we ſée their want of loue prouoke our tongs to ſpeak vnlouingly. We ſay not in our ſelues with a pauſe vpon the matter, what am I about to ſay, to whō of whō, to what end? Wil it hurt him or profit him, what is my deſire, how wold I wiſh if his caſe were mine &amp; ſo foorth? but headily, vnaduiſedly, &amp; I feare vnlouingly we ſpeake what we liſt, &amp; almoſt ſay with ye wicked:
                     Pſalm.
                   
                  our tongs are our own &amp; who ſhal control vs? Therfore I ſay again for this branch of murder by the tong the god of mercy be merciful to vs &amp; truly teach vs both how we ſin in it, &amp; how we ought to be reformed of it. For reproches how ſtand we?
                     Reproch.
                   Haue we neuer curſed ye deafe, nor put a ſtumbling blocke before ye blind? That is, haue we neuer inſulted ouer any mās infirmity, or vnkindly reproched him with his imperfectiō? O ſpiteful tongs of ours, how paſſe they the bonds of loue herein? It is our pleaſure to bewray the wantes of others, it is our paſtime to gréeue

their ſpirites and t
                     •
                   gaule them for thē, yea wee glorie in their ignominie, wee ſwell in conceit of our ſelues when we ſée them, and we ſtretch out our necks and lift vp our hautie eyes when wee paſſe by them. Their weakeneſſe is our boaſt all the day long, haunting them &amp; riding them as we vſe to ſpeake in euerie corner, and as verie Phariſies wée are in an other caſe, wee looke at their wantes, wee exalt our ſelues, and in pride wee ſpeake it, or at leaſt inwardlie thinke it, wee are not as thoſe ſéelie Idiotes are. Rare is that man and woman that with a tender heart comforteth and couereth whō they ſée to néed, as they wiſhe their owne wantes with the ſufficiencie of Ieſus Chriſt couered from the wrath which they deſerue. But I truſt for the time that is to come, it ſhall neuer bee verified of vs, which wee haue heard before out of Salomon ſpoken, that, The mā which is accuſtomed to opprobrious wordes,
                  
                     Prou. 23.15.
                   
                  will neuer bee reformed all the dayes of his life.
                  
                     Prou. 28.13.
                   And for that which is paſt the God of mercie wipe it out as hee hath

promiſed. Let vs conſider the mockes and tauntes that haue paſſed from vs euen with ioy in our wittes that wee coulde ſo doe, and euerie ſpeach ſo néere as wee can, whereby our brethren haue receiued harme priuately or openly in place of iuſtice, or out of it. And are we then vpright before the Lorde touching the murder of ye tongue?
                     Pſal. 7.32.
                   
                  Bleſſed is the man whoſe vnrighteouſneſſe is forgiuen and whoſe ſinne euen in this reſpect is couered. The murder of the heart remaineth, wherein wee are to wey howe we haue euer vppon anie occaſion ſuffered miſlike to growe within vs of our brethren, or anger, or harred, or enuie, reioycing at other mens falles, deſire of reuenge, crueltie, or bitterneſſe, pretermiſſion of oportunitie, or anie other braunch thereof, and whether through our negligence and ſuffering Satan to créepe vppon vs, euen all theſe almoſt haue not béene within vs at one time or other, one pulling on an other, as thinges vnſeparable. Howe hath miſliking of ſome, and we well knewe not why, made vs apt to anger with anie

thing which they did, &amp; often diſpleaſed with them more than we ſhould? How hath anger beeing lodged too long changed his nature and become hatred in vs? Howe hath hatred hatched vp enuie and deſire of reuenge? Howe hath enuie wiſhed the fall of others, ſpited their good whatſoeuer it was, ioyed at their miſerie, if wee liued to ſée it? Howe hath deſire of reuenge pricked vs to the thing it ſelfe, nurced vp crueltie and ouer great ſeueritie? What wantes haue we ſhowed of tender compaſſion and comfort to the comfortles? What prolonging haue wee made of the good which wee haue doone, and howe careleſlie haue wee paſſed many an oportunitie to doe our dueties in kindeneſſe to our brethren? Alas then where is the perfection of our loue, where is the innocencie of our life, where is that integritie of ours touching this commaundement which we dare preſent of it ſelfe to pleaſe before the Lord? Our heartes are ſtayned, our tongues haue ſtrayed, and euen our handes alſo peraduenture againſt it

                  
                     •
                  aue gréeuouſlie offended. Let vs 
                     •
                  hinke of it and the Lorde giue vs 
                     •
                  eartes effectuallie to féele it. For the 
                     •
                  ight of ſinne, can neuer hurt vs when 
                     •
                  t cauſeth ſorow and true repentaunce. And to ſée ſinne to diſpare we néede not,

            The ſeuenth Commaundement.
            
               Thou ſhalt not commit adulterie.
            
            
               Queſtion.
            
            
               
                  WHat is the meaning of this commaundement?
            
            
               
                  The act.
               
               Anſ. Firſt there is forbidden all adulterie, fornication, and other vncleaneſſe in our bodies (ſaith your booke) which néedeth no proofe beſides the plaine wordes of the lawe, and that print which in his conſcience euerie one carrieth about: yet hath the author added ſome for more ſtrength againſt the frowarde, which I leaue to euerie one to read by thēſelues. Secondly there are forbidden all vnpure thoughtes, and luſtes of the heart. For as in the other commandementes it hath béene ſayde,
                  The thought.
                ſo is it to be thought of againe in this: The lawe giuer is ſpirituall, and therefore this law. Beſides

it is teſtified in plaine wordes, that not onelie he is guiltie of this lawe which committeth the act, but hee alſo which looketh vpon a woman and luſteth after her.
                  Math. 5.28.
                Thirdly the Apoſtle placeth chaſtitie in bodie and mind, and therefore the contrarie is incident both to bodie and mind. Nay in verie truth, man is rather that, which he is in mind,
                  Man is that which he is in heart.
                than that which he is is bodie. The qualitie of the hart is the quality of the man, &amp; therfore an adulterous hart, an adulterous man no doubt, and a breaker of this commā
               dement. Now what a generalitie may this particularitie very profitably teach vs, namely not onely to runne to the outward ſhew we beare, and to our bodie with the actions thereof, when wee would iudge of our ſelues, but euen to our verie heart, and inward thoughts, to ſée how all doeth there, and as there we finde, ſo to giue ſentence. If there be integritie, then ſo thinke: but if there be luſt and adulterie, if there be diſſimulation and falſehood, if there be iniquitie &amp; ſinne, then according to it let vs thinke of our ſelues, and ſay the Lord be mercifull

to vs ſuch &amp; ſuch, for as our harts are, ſo are we. Moreouer it may giue vs a great light to diſcrie ye ſpirit that guideth the Church of Rome. For if God cō
               demne the thought, how allow they the fact of ſimple fornication at the leaſt,
                  And of Sodomie for the 3. hote moneths
                if not of adulterie, and yet ſay, they haue the ſpirit too? Is the ſpirit of God ſo variable that ſomtime he condemneth the thought, &amp; ſometimes alloweth the very fact? What an impietie were this to bée ſaid or thought? Therfore ſtrange out of queſtion from the Lord is their ſpirite. Thirdly in this commandement is condemned that thing whatſoeuer, which inticeth to any vncleannes wherof there might many particulars be named.
            
               Que. And I pray you for more plainneſſe let it not be greeuous to name ſome of the chiefe.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Firſt then here is forbidden all wanton &amp; immodeſt lookes, for the eye is a vehement inticer vnto luſt, as appeareth by manie proofes. For thus fell Putiphars wife into vngodly luſting after Ioſeph:
                  Gen. 39.
                for the text ſaith ſhée caſt her eies vpon Ioſeph. Thus came Dauid to

adulterie with Berſabe, euen by diſorderlie looking vpon her from his houſe top. Thus fell the ſons of God into vnlawful loue with the daughters of men,
                  Gen. 6.
                by ſéeing that they were faire. This cauſed Peter to ſay of the wicked that they had adulterous eyes.
                  2. Pet. 2.
                And the knowledge of it made Iob to take a bonde of his eyes,
                  Iob. 31.
                that they ſhoulde not looke vppon a mayde. Whereunto for an other inticement to vncleanneſſe wee may referre all vndecent and vncomelie pictures, the corruption of our eyes, and conſequentlie of our heartes, and therefore no doubt héere alſo condemned. Thirdlie vnchaſt behauiour ſuch as the Lorde crieth out againſt by his prophete, ſaying, that The daughters of Sion are hautie,
               
                  Eſay. 3.
                
               and walke with ſtretched out neeckes and with wandring eyes, walking and muſing as they goe, and making a tinckling with their feete, &amp;c. Fourthlie all wanton ſpeach, filthie tales, ſongs, and ſonets of loue &amp; lightnes, laſciuious ſalutatiōs and ſuch like. For euill wordes corrupt good maners,
               
                  1. Cor. 15.
                and there muſt no corrupt

communication procéede out of our mouthes, but ſuch as is good to the vſe of edifying and may miniſter grace to ye hearers.
                  Ephe. 5.3.
                As for filthines, fooliſh talking, ieſting, and ſuch like, they are thinges vncomelie for a Chriſtian. Againe, vnchaſt bookes and wanton writinges, who knoweth not howe they tickle to vncleannes? and therfore both they and the reading of them forbidden in this lawe. Sixtly too much ſhowe in apparel, painting, tricking and trimming of our ſelues aboue conueniencie, it is a daungerous allurer of luſt, and therefore forbidden.
            
               Que. I could wiſh yet a litle larger ſpeach of apparell, becauſe I ſee it is one of the wormes that waſteth at this day the common wealth, that decaieth houſkeeping, that maketh ſtrait the hande of the maſter to his ſeruant, and the Lord to his tenant, and a thing to conclude that the deere children of God cannot ouercome them ſelues in.
               
            
            
               
                  Apparell.
               
               Anſ. And I will willingly anſwere your wiſh with a litle more ſpeach of it, yet not ſuch, as with diligence might

be made, but ſuch rather as I haue at times thought of, &amp; found in ſome manner effectual. Firſt therefore me thinke ye very originall of apparel ſhould much mooue a Chriſtian féeling hart. For whē we had ſinned, thē were we clothed:
               
                  Gen. 2.
                
               whē we had loſt our honor, then were we apparelled: ſo that it is the ſigne of our ſin, the badge of our rebellion, the witnes of our ſhame, and it remembreth vnto vs, what we ſhoulde wéepe continually to think, that we haue loſt. Now alas how ſmall cauſe haue we to be proude of ſuch a liuerie? Nay ſée the dulneſſe of our harts and the abſurdnes of our dealing. If a thiefe ſhould be ſaued frō hanging, with this condition added, that he ſhold euer weare a halter, were it not a ſtrange hardnes of his hart, if he ſhould ſo forget his fall, &amp; ſo glory in his ſhame teſtified day &amp; night vnto him by ye halter, that he ſhould begin to boaſt of his halter, to be proud of it, and to make it of ſilke in ſumptuous ſort, for an ornamēt to his necke? Truly it were. And ſo it is in mā a very ſtrange worke of ſathan, yt he ſhould ſo excéed in pride with ye thing

the ſight whereof ſhoulde rather pinch his hart with ſorowe, than be ſo exalted euen out of his owne knowledge, wt apparell, which in truth (ſpeake as a good hart ſhold féele it) ſhold humble vs, beat vs downe, &amp; make vs euen with ye peacocke let our feathers fal for the foulnes of our féet. Therfore I ſay one thing me think to draw vs to mediocritie in this matter ſhould be the wel weying of the firſt beginning of apparel. Secondly the ſpéedie waſt of it is ſomething. For how can a good conſcience warrant vnto vs ſuch great charge, yea ſuch excéeding charge in a thing ſo changeable, whē we ſhal giue an accompt how we beſtowed our goods? The matter or ye forme failes, ere euer our price be halfe anſwered wt vſe. And there is no eſtate in earth yt may warrant a chriſtian man or woman to be a wilful waſter of the lords gifts vnto thē. Thirdly the miſliking of ye word ſhould make miſliking in my hart of exceſſe or vanitie in this matter. Now the Lord ſaith in the lawe: Thou ſhalt not weare a garment of diuers ſortes,
               
                  Deut. 12.
                
               as of wollen &amp; linen together. The meaning

whereof was this, he wold not haue thē newfangle, wanton and phantaſtical in their apparel. The ſame God crieth out againſt the Iewes by his prophet that he wold take away ye ornament of ye ſlippers, &amp; the cals, &amp; the round attires,
               
                  Eſay. 3.
                
               the ſweet bals, the bracelets &amp; the bonets, the attyres of the heade &amp; the ſlops, the headbands, the tablets, and the earings, the rings &amp; the mufflers, the coſtly apparell &amp; the vailes, the wimples, &amp; the criſping pins, the glaſſes, the hoods &amp; the lawnes. With which in extremitie vſed no dout they had prouooked the Lord, &amp; daily did offend him. Alſo by an other prophet, I will viſit the princes and the kinges children,
               
                  Sophon. 1.8.
                
               &amp; al ſuch as are clothed with ſtrāge apparell: that is, as imitate the vaine faſhions of other countries in any vaine manner. And the Apoſtle Paul hath a moſt plaine ſpeach to women,
                  1. Tim. 2.9.
                whereby men alſo may knowe their dutie. I will ſaith he, that the women araie themſelues in comly apparel with ſhamefaſtnes &amp; modeſtie, not with 
               
                  Read the note of this word in the Teſtament.
                
               brodred haire or gold, or pearles, or coſtly apparel, but as becommeth women that profeſſe the

feare of God with good workes. Which very ſame words Peter alſo hath to the ſame ende.
                  1. Pet. 3.3.
                Theſe with many mo ſuch places ſhew vs the miſliking of ye Lorde of diſorder in apparell, &amp; they ſhoulde I ſay me thinke make vs miſlike alſo with it.  Fourthly the ſentences of graue and godly fathers, which haue ſpoken of this matter ſhoulde not be neglected of vs. And what are they? If the matter of our apparel be too coſtly, heare what S. Bernard ſaith: Exterior ſuperfluitas veſtiū, interioris hominis inditiū: The outwarde ſuperfluitie &amp; waſt of the garment, is an euident token of the inward man
                (that he is vnreformed.) If the forme &amp; faſhion be vnſéemely or wanton, then ſaith the ſame father, 
                  Ʋeſtiū curioſitas deformitatis mentis &amp; morū inditium eſt, The curioſitie of thy garment bewrayeth deformitie of mind &amp; maners in thee.
                Thus matter &amp; forme being vnſéeming, either of thē diſcredite man &amp; woman, &amp; make their inward hidden corruption appeare to the worlde.  Fiftly all the worlde knoweth it, and it cannot be denyed that immoderate apparell is a vehement inticement to ye breach of this commandemēt:

and therefore wicked. Caſtitatis comes frugalitas, The companion of chaſtitie is frugalitie, ſayeth a learned man, and euen in apparell. I would to God, if with a Chriſtian heart anie will not thinke of theſe two laſt reaſons, yet that they woulde thinke of them with worldly wiſedome, &amp; in pollicie weigh them. For there is no man nor woman ſo farre fallen out with religion, and honeſtie, but that if they be not ſuch yet they deſire to ſéeme ſo, and to be ſo taken. Nowe apparell in matter or forme vnſéemely robbeth them of this that they neither ſéeme nor are thought to be of manie. For touching religion, who can thinke them mortified to ſinne within in heart, who ſo ſéeme to liue to all vanitie and exceſſe without in bodie? Who can thinke they are reformed in ſoule, who are very much aboue their calling vnreformed in ſhowe? Man can not enter to the inwarde heart, but iudgeth euer by the outwarde fruite, and religion within vſeth alwaies to ſhewe men effectes without. For honeſtie of bodie, though our hearts neuer

meant any thing contrarie to it, yet doe we by apparel bring our credite in queſtion, when it paſſeth our calling and conueniencie. And therefore euen in pollicie, if we care not for Chriſtianitie we ſhould beware. Laſt of all, modeſtie in apparell both touching matter, and forme, anſwereth to the originall of it well, which was to hide vs after ſinne, confirmeth by practiſe that apparell is vaine, liueth according to the named ſcriptures, eſcaping the threatned euils, and finding promiſed good, ſaueth our credite out of queſtion, aunſwereth the grauitie of the goſpell, hindreth no pietie (for often vnder an ill garment a good heart is hidden) and laſtly is ſo farre from alluring to luſt, that it euen cutteth the throte of it, and very greatly ſtoppeth it. Sex ſunt enim quae incorruptam ſeruant caſtitatem: Scilicet, ſobrietas, operatio, inhibitio ſenſuum, aſperitas cultus, raritas ſermonis, euitatio oportunitatis, perſonae, loci, &amp; temporis. That is, There are ſix thinges which keepe chaſtitie vncorrupted: To wit, ſobrietie, labour, reſtraint of our ſenſes,

courſeneſſe of apparel, rarenes of ſpeech, and eſchewe all of oportunitie, of perſon, place, or time. O but yet it ſticks in our hearts ye apparel makes a man. Indéede manie ſo iudge both of themſelues and other, that they are made, and beautified by apparell. But the verie heathen man ſhall condemne vs, if we doe ſo, who coulde thus ſay, that: Ornamentum est quod ornat, ornat autem quod honestiorem facit. Id autem non aurum, non ſmaragdus, coccus, ſed quaecunque grauitatis, pudoris, &amp; moderationis ſpeciem praebent. That is an ornament (ſaith he) which adorneth vs, and that adorneth vs yt maketh vs honeſter. Now that doeth not gould, precious ſtone, skarlet, but that which giueth a ſhewe of grauitie, ſhamefaſtnes, &amp; moderation. And thus now let it ſuffice a litle to haue anſwered your deſire touching apparel, pretermitting ye iudgement of God vpon Herode euē then when he was moſt royally clothed aboue all other times,
                  Act. 12.
                with many thinges mo, which to this ende might be brought. And this I pray you take not ſpoken to drawe all to an equalitie, or yet anie from the thing

that is méete for their calling, but to kindle care in all, that wee deceiue not our ſelues with our calling worldlie ſo much, that we forget our calling to God, to his goſpell, and to his mercies ſo manie in Ieſus Chriſt, and what is conuenient for the grauitie and excellencie thereof. This is my meaning, and this is my ende.
            
               Que. Now then proceede I pray you to recite ſuch other prouocations to the breach of this commaundement as you knowe.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Theſe prophane &amp; wanton ſtage playes or interludes, what an occaſion they are of adulterie and vncleaneneſſe by geſture, by ſpéech, by conueyances, and deuiſes to attaine to ſo vngodly deſires, the world knoweth with too much hurt by long experience. Vanities they are if we make the beſt of them, and the Prophet prayeth to haue his eies turned away by the Lorde from beholding ſuch matter:
                  Pſal. 119.
                
               Euill wordes corrupt good manners,
               
                  1. Cor. 15.
                and they haue abundance. There is in them euer manie dangerous ſightes,
                  1. Theſ. 5.22.
                and wee muſt abſtaine

from al appearance of euill. They corrupt the eies with alluring geſtures: the eyes, the heart: and the heart, the bodie, till al be horrible before the Lord. Hiſtrionicis geſtibus inquinantur omnia: (ſayth Chryſoſtome) Theſe players behauiour polluteth all thinges. And of their playes he ſaith, they are the feaſts of Sathan, the inuentions of the deuill, &amp;c. Councels haue decréeed verie ſharply againſt them, and polluted bodies by theſe filthie occaſions haue on their death beddes confeſſed the daunger of them, lamented their owne foule and gréeuous faulles, and left their warning for euer with vs to beware of them. But I referre you to them, that vpon good knowledge of the abominations of them, haue written largely &amp; wel againſt them. If they be dangerous on the day time, more daungerous on the night certainely: if on a ſtage, &amp; in open courtes, much more in chambers and priuate houſes. For there are manie roumes beſide that, where the play is, &amp; peraduēture the ſtrangenes of the place &amp; lacke of light to guide them, cauſeth

errour in their way, more than good Chriſtians ſhould in their houſes ſuffer.
            
               Que. What elſe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Dancing againe is in the number of vaine paſtimes, and the allurements to vncleanneſſe, as much experience hath too wel proued. The ſcriptures checke it, the fathers miſlike it, the coū
               cels haue condemned it, &amp; the proofe of Gods iudgementes vpon it biddeth vs beware. Inſtrumenta luxuriae tympana &amp; tripudia, ſayth one, the inticers to luſt are pipinges and dancinges. Laquei ſunt &amp; ſcandala non ſolū ſaltatoribus, ſed ſpectatoribus. They are ſnares and offences not onely to the actors, but alſo to ye beholders.
               
                  Iob. 21.11.
                
               Iob noteth it as an olde practiſe of the deuil to occupy men withall, &amp; as an ancient exerciſe of the wicked, that they ſhould daunce. Vpon which wordes a godly writer ſayeth:
                  Calu. ſerm. 80. vpon Iob.
                that from the tabret and the flute, which in themſelues are not vnlawefull, they come to dauncing, which is the chiefeſt miſchiefe of all. For there is alway (ſayth he) ſuch vnchaſt behauiour in dauncing, that of it ſelfe, and as they abuſe it, (to ſpeake

               
                  •
               he trueth in the worde) it is nothing elſe, but an inticement to whoredome. In the goſpell the ſpirite of God noteth it in a wicked woman as an immodeſt thing,
                  Math. 14.
                &amp; of a damnable effect in her wicked father Herode to dance. And ſuch as interpret the place are not afraide of theſe words,

                  iae turpis nota nubilis puellae ſaltatio. That is, that for her to dance beeing a maide for yeares mariageable, was a note of whoriſh wantonneſſe. For whoſoeuer (ſaith he) hath a care of honeſt grauitie, he euer condemneth dancing, and eſpecially in a maide. Againe hee calleth it ſpectaculum familiae Regiae probroſum. A diſhonorable ſight in a kings houſe:
                with manie ſpeaches moe of miſlike. Sirac a wiſe man,
                  Syrac. 9.4.
                and of great experience, biddeth a man not to vſe the companie of a woman, that is a ſinger and a dauncer, neither to heare her, leaſt hee bee taken with her craftineſſe. The godlie Fathers as I ſaide miſlike it. For ſaltatio ad adulteras,
               
                  Ambroſ. de virgin. lib. 3.
                
               non ad pudicas pertinet, ſaith one of them: Dauncing belongeth to adulterous

and not to honeſt women. A ſharpe ſpéeche: Yet was this graue father not afraide to ſpeake it. Saltatio barathrum diaboli,
               
                  Chryſt. Math. hom. 48.
                ſayth an other: dauncing is the deuils hell. And we heare ſpéeche of Iacobs mariage (ſaith he) in the ſcripture,
                  in Geneſ.
                but not a worde of anie dauncing that was at it.
                  Theophilact. in Mar. 6.
                
               Mira colluſio ſayth an other, Saltat diabolus per puellam: It is a ſtrange iugling, when wee thinke the maide doth daunce, and it is not ſo, but the deuill in her, or by her. The councels haue condemned it as others haue at large ſhewed. And verie Tullie could ſay, an honeſt man would not dance in an open place for a great patrimonie. For the iudgementes of God vpon this vaine paſtime, it is ſtrange which Pantaleon noteth out of Crantzius, that in Colbecke a towne in Germanie, certaine light perſons hopping and dauncing in the Churchyearde of S. Magnus,
               
                  An. 1505.
                beeing by the miniſter admoniſhed to ceaſe, and not ceaſing, did for a long time (not able to ſtay) runne rounde about, and at laſt fell all downe dead. But becauſe others haue ſo largelie

writ againſt this vanitie, I ſay no more of it at this time, but wiſh vs to conſider that it is an inticement otten to adulterie, and therefore in this commaundement forbidden. And as for anie dauncing that wee reade of in the ſcriptures to haue béene vſed of the godly, we muſt vnderſtande, that their dancing was euer a ſober modeſt motion, with ſome ſong vſually to Gods praiſe, and men by themſelues, women by themſelues. Which nothing will warrant our cuſtome and guiſe in theſe daies.
            
               Que. Are there yet anie moe allurementes?
               
            
            
               Anſ. There are yet many mo. But I may not in this ſort ſtande vpon them. Gluttonie &amp; drunkenneſſe,
                  Ezek 16.
                with houſes of open whoredome, your booke nameth and proofes for them. Idleneſſe alſo is an other meanes,
                  1. Cor. 7.39.
                the vowe of chaſtitie, the deniall of ſeconde mariages, the going of men in womens apparell, and women in mans apparell,
                  Deut. 22.
                with a number ſuch. This onelie muſt I ſay, and ſo conclude this negatiue part of

the commaundement,
                  For he that will no euill do, muſt nothing doe that longs thereto.
                looke whatſoeuer, it is, that we can ſée to bee anie allurement, anie occaſion, or meanes to vncleanneſſe, all that is condemned in this commaundement as much as the verie act of adulterie, which heere onely is expreſſed. Then howe the holie Pope of Rome can warrant by the worde of God the erection and continuaunce of his ſtewes, iudge you, although his gaine be neuer ſo much thereby. Nay howe could that monſter Sixtus the fourth warrant the erection of a ſtewes of both kindes,
                  In king Edwarde 4.
                that is both of women and men, whereby 20000 and ſome yeares 40 thouſande ducketes came to his coffers? Or the whole Church of Rome ſo like of, and ſo diminiſh the ſinne of fornication? Can this their ſpirite that guideth them, be the ſpirite of GOD, when it condemneth not the act, whereof God condemneth all occaſions and allurementes? No, no, the Lorde giue vs eies, and then haue we markes ſufficient to bewray them by.
            
               Que. Thus then may we ſee what we

                     
                        •
                     re forbidden in this lawe: nowe I pray you adde ſomething of the thinges we are commaunded in the ſame.
               
            
            
               Anſ. For this matter your booke anſwereth well, that as wee are forbidden in it all vncleanneſſe, and all inticementes to the ſame: ſo on the other ſide we are commaunded to kéepe our bodies and ſoules chaſt, and pure as temples of the holy ghoſt, or if the guift of chaſtitie be not giuen vs, then to vſe the lawefull remedie appointed for vs by God, which is mariage. Concerning therefore chaſtity we are to know, that verie greatly the ſcripture layeth downe Gods liking of it, and with many wordes exhorteth vs vnto it. This is the will of God (ſayth the Apoſtle) euen your ſanctification, and that you ſhould abſtaine from fornication,

                  hat euerie one of you ſhould know how to poſſeſſe their veſſels in honor and ho

                  2. Cor. 7.1.
                
               Seeing (ſayth he) that we haue theſe promiſes dearly beloued, let vs clenſe our ſelues frō al filthines

of the fleſh and ſpirite and grow vp vnto all holineſſe in the feare of God. And againe the ſame Apoſtle beſeecheth the God of peace to ſanctifie them throughout,
               
                  1. Theſ. 5.23.
                
               that their whole ſpirit, and body, &amp; ſoule may be kept blameleſſe til the day of the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Manie ſuch as theſe are there, all which our vner

               Que. In other matters indeede we haue good cauſe to refuſe them, but in this (giue me leaue to ſpeake as I thinke being readie to learne if I erre) me

               Anſ. Well then, for your better ſatiſ

                  •
                conſider the courſe of this errour. And firſt I pray you marke, that during al
                  •
               
               
the time of the olde teſtament they dare not, nor do not ſay, that ſingle life paſſed mariage in excellencie, but contrarie to be fruitefull and ſtored of children was a bleſſing, and to be otherwiſe was a reproch vnto them. Therefore this perfection and excellencie of ſingle life, they ſet it to be but nowe in the time of the goſpell. Where let vs alſo beginne, and going with them, ſée whether it be ſo or no. We conſider then and ſée, that as the Lorde is holy himſelfe and pure, and therefore hath euer liked and loued all holineſſe in his children, and by name this cleanneſſe of bodie and mind, which we ſpeake of: ſo on the otherſide Sathan being impure and filthy, hath euer ſought and laboured to worke the like in vs, and by name to drawe vs to impuritie of fleſh and ſtaine of minde in this behalfe. The Lorde hath had euer his meanes to worke the one: Sathan hath had his againe to bréede the other. The Lorde by his word and ſpirite, and what elſe it pleaſed him to vſe: Sathan by ſundrie alſo verie forcible wayes wrought the contrarie. Some hee ſo

mightily hardened, and ſtrangely ouercame,
                  Want of feeling one meanes of Sathan.
                that euen contemning the Lord and his threates, and ſmoothering what in their owne conſciences at anie time they founde contrarie to it, gaue themſelues ouer as it had béene brute and ſauage beaſtes to all luſt and vncleanneſſe without remorſe. Of theſe ſpake the Apoſtle to the Epheſians ſaying:
                  Epheſ. 4.19.
                
               That they being paſt feeling gaue themſelues to all wantonneſſe to worke vncleanneſſe euen with greedineſſe, where the worde hee vſeth is verie ſignificant. And againe to the Romans he ſaith, that God gaue them vp to their hearts luſtes vnto vncleanneſſe,
               
                  Rom. 26.
                
               to defile their owne bodies betwixt themſelues, yea he gaue them vp to vile affections. For the women changed the naturall vſe into that which is againſt nature. Then ſheweth he the meanes and way, whereby all this was wrought in them. For a man would thinke yt euen reaſon and natur
                  •
                ſhould kéepe vs from ſuch pollution▪ 
               They regarded not (ſayth the Apoſtle) to knowe God,
               
                  Ver. 28.
                
               and therefore God deliuered them vp into a reprobate mind

to doe thoſe thinges which are not conuenient. That is, God ſuffered Satan ſo to harden their heartes and to depriue them of the vſe euen of naturall light, as that thoſe thinges ſéemed but ſportes vnto them, and matters of ſmall weight, which otherwiſe would haue feared them euen to thinke vpon. The prophet Oſe ſéemeth to alledge the very ſame manner of procéeding of Sathan in thoſe that know God. When he ſaith of Iſrael,
               
                  Oſe. 4.11.
                that whoredome and wine and newe wine tooke away their heartes. That is, their iudgement and vnderſtanding, their conſcience and féeling, whereby they ſhould abhorre ſo diſpleaſing a life before the Lorde. And what meaneth Salomon when he ſaith, that The young man followeth the inticeing harlotte to her houſe as an oxe to the ſlaughter, but euen this,
                  Prou. 7.22.
                that by the ſubtill malice of Sathan hee is depriued of ſenſe to decerne whither hee goeth, and what his fall will be? So then I ſay one meanes whereby Sathan in times paſt drewe men from chaſtitie, the vertue of this

commaundement, to luſt and impuritie the breaches of the ſame, was by dulling their heartes in moſt fearefull manner, that they felt not ſinne to be ſin, no not euen verie great and gréeuous ſinnes to be anie at all. An other meanes was by inſtilling into their mindes an opinion of indifferencie in theſe matters,
                  Opinion of indifferencie an other meanes.
                and that God (ſo he were ſerued in ſpirite of them) paſſed not for their bodies, but left them in ſome ſort to themſelues, to vſe to their pleaſures. This (to omit a multitude of heathen hiſtories, as alſo Simon Magus whome Auſten noteth a defender of this doctrine) may appeare by that decrée of the Apoſtles, that the Gentilles ſhould abſtaine from fornication,
                  Act. 15.
                as alſo moſt euidently by the epiſtle of Paule to the Corinthians, who thought of this matter as of a méere naturall thing, ſo lawefull for them as either to eate or drinke, ſo they reſerued their ſoules and ſpirites to worſhippe GOD. But the Apoſtle ſheweth it to be farre otherwiſe, and with manie vehement repetitions of the duties of their bodies,

impugneth ſo vile a conceite of libertie to vſe them vnto luſt. Hee hath created your bodies ſaith the Apoſtle,
                  V. 13. &amp; 14.
                aſwel as your ſoules, and therefore you muſt glorifie him aſwell in bodie as in ſoule. Hee preſerueth alſo the one aſwell as the other, the bloude of Chriſt was ſhedde aſwell for the one as the other to redéeme it from death, they are both indifferentlie the Temples of the holie ghoſt, they are both the members of Chriſt, and at the latter day they muſt both by Chriſt be rayſed, the body then to be ioyned to the ſoule, which before liued ſeparated, and therefore aſwell in bodie as ſoule God muſt be glorified, and both of them from filthie luſt and pollution kept chaſt. Manie moe are the reaſons of Paul in that Epiſtle to driue the Corinthians from this deteſtable conceipt,
                  V. 17.
                that fornication was a matter indifferent, and chaſtitie required not ſo much in bodie as in mind. But I referre them to the diligent reader himſelfe to marke, and thus much onelie note to ſhew the meanes whereby Satan in thoſe dayes preuailed ſo

much to draw men to the breach of this commandement. A thirde meanes wee reade of which argueth not a litle the dulneſſe of man, &amp; the boldneſſe of ſatan if once he get any vantage. Euen ye verie word of god abuſed to confirme yt which neither God nor his worde could euer abide.
                  The ſcriptures wreſted an other meanes. Chap. 2.
                In the Apocalips, mention is made of ye 
               Nicolaitans ſinning in this reſpect moſt fearfully: &amp; it is alſo by learned mē recorded how Nicholas the firſt father of ye filthineſſe fel into groſſe &amp; moſt fearful ſinne. Clemens &amp; Euſebius ſay that he did it of méere ſimplicity to remooue frō him the ſuſpition of ieloſie, and to giue a teſtimonie vnto the worlde, that hee was not, contrarie to the profeſſion of a Chriſtian, too much addicted to anie earthly thing, ſince it is writen, that he which hateth not father or mother, wife or child for Chriſt, cannot be his diſciple: and no man can ſerue two maiſters, with ſuch other places moſt wickedly wreſted to bring in a moſt horrible concluſion. Carpocrates and his ſect through their abominable life was warranted by that ſpeach of Paul,
               
                  Rom. 2.
                that anger &amp; tribulation

ſhalbe vpon euerie ſoule that ſinneth. Sée ſay they, how he ſaith vpon euery ſoule, not vpon euery body, ſo that our bodies we may vſe as wee liſt. Others vſed theſe places: We are not vnder the law, but vnder grace. Iuſto non eſt lex poſita, There is no law for the iuſt, and ſuch other. By all which things it is apparant how mightily Satan hath bent his force to draw men to the pollution of their bodies, and to vncleanneſſe forbidden in this commandemēt. Now marke ſtil I pray you ye courſe of this matter, &amp; ſée how as ye Church of God euer withſtood this worke of ſatan in meaſure, &amp; ſought to eſtabliſh honeſt life &amp; chaſt behauiour, as I haue before ſhewed: ſo in the beginning of ye goſpel eſpecially (as moſt cauſe was giuen through the abū
               dance of ye contrarie ſin) verie vehemētly, &amp; ſharpely was condemned ye libertie of luſt, &amp; filthie affection, which then ruled, &amp; on ye contrariy ſide was vrged chaſtitie, chaſtitie, with reaſons laid downe for ye excellēcie of it, &amp; the cōmandemēts of god for it. And indéed ſo zelouſly, ſo diligētly, &amp; ſo effectually was this done by the

godlie teachers of thoſe times, as that Satans ſubtilties preuailing ſo much before to the contrarie, beganne to looſe their ſtrength daily more &amp; more. For the hardneſſe of mens heart through which ſinne ſo greatly increaſed, was turned into ſoftneſſe, and Chriſtian féeling: their ignorance which accompted ſo foule a ſinne an indifferent matter, was dailie diminiſhed and turned into knowledge: their iudgements before abuſed with ſhowe of ſcriptures to confirme their euill, were bettered by the ſpirite of light to perceiue and ſée how fowlie theſe ſcriptures were wreſted to a wrong ende, and howe many apparantlie commaunded the contrarie. So that their conſciences being quickned, their eyes opened, and their vnderſtanding augmented by continuall and godlie teaching, luſt waxed leſſe or at leaſt more orderlie to the ſhow of man. For it brake not out in ſuch confuſed manner, as before, to all and euerie one, that was liked, and might bee obtained. Nowe then yet ſée a diuell. When he ſawe his kingdome in

men thus euery day fal to ruine through diligent exhortations vnto chaſtitie, ſo that he was not able to deale with men as before, &amp; to make thē litle accompt of actuall pollution as hee had doone, what deuiſeth hee yet ſtill to continue his venime in mankinde? Surelie euen this (note it and wonder) hee himſelfe falleth to preach and teach chaſtitie alſo by his miniſters, and to extoll it to heauen. But howe? Not as he ſhould I warrant you, but as it beſt ſerued for his wicked intent. He doeth not teach men to kéepe bodie and mind pure from all vncleane actions or conceiptes, but he laboreth to perſwade that outward continencie of bodie (what broyles of ſcorching luſt ſoeuer the minde abideth) is an holie thing before God, of it ſelfe acceptable, and meritorious. Hee doeth not teach men that there is an acceptable chaſtitie in godlie matrimonie, if ye gift of continencie bee not giuen, but vnto certayne perſons hee flatlie forbiddeth it, as not tollerable, and generallie in all hee doeth note it as culpable, preferring ſingle life in dignitie, holineſſe,

&amp; merite before it in al men. Thus taught his ſcholer and inſtrument Marcion the heretike about the yeare of Chriſt 133. publiſhing and teaching, that the coniunction of man and womā euen in matrimonie was ſinne, that it procéeded or was inuented of a contrarie God, that women wholy were ye worke of the diuell, &amp; men alſo the one halfe of thē. He would alow none to be baptiſed, vnles they either were ſingle or would promiſe euer after to be ſo, &amp;c. To this end againe ſtepped vp Tatianus and his crew about the yeare 142. and he at the firſt aſwel as Marcion condemned matrimonie altogether alſo, but afterward he drew in his ſpeach from openly touching it anie more, and vnder the high commendation of ſingle life priuily pinched at the ſtayned eſtate of wedlocke, and ſought to make it hatefull. Whereupon his folowers were called Encratites. After Tatianus came Montanus about the yeare 145. who ſuffered firſt mariges in ſuch as were weake,

                it was generally ſaid vnto all men, &amp; not onely to vnmarried men, that they ſhold poſſeſſe their veſſels in holineſſe &amp; honour, &amp; not in the concupiſcence of the fleſh. Therefore mariage is holineſſe and not vncleanneſſe before God anie iote more than ſingle life is. In the Epiſtle to Timothie the forbidding of mariage is called a doctrine of the diuell,
                  1. Timoth. 4.

For his thirde ſpeach, that the married woman taketh care to pleaſe her huſband, but the vnmarried to pleaſe the Lord, no way may it be taken to prooue that none yt be maried either doe or can take care to pleaſe God, for the contrary of that hath bin euidently ſhewed in the places before: or yet to inferre yt the vnmaried doe euer ſéeke to pleaſe him, for experience too much teacheth the contrarie: but it onlie ſhoweth thus much, that ſuch as be vnmaried if they be godlily diſpoſed, may more fréely and readily as it were attend their deuotion than others yt be married, hauing nothing to trouble thē or to diſtract their cogitations withal. Which alſo as you ſée is but

an outward reſpect. And therefore we may now conclude that far was it from the meaning of Paul, to prefer ſingle life before matrimonie, in reſpect of greater pietie or merite before God, but only in reſpect of outward incūbrances, whereof indéede it is much fréer than the other eſtate is.

                not to dare once to exhibit his ſingle life to ye maieſtie of God to merite any thing for him, or to

purchaſe him any fauour, but only and wholy to depend vpon ye merits of chriſt Ieſus. And we ſée not Peter, Philip or anie in the new Teſtament, yt were married to begge any pardon for it at Gods hand, or to inſinuate anie way, any impietie of theirs in ſo doing. Which yet aſſuredly they would haue doone, if the opinion of poperie had bin true concerning ſingle life and matrimonie.

               S. Auguſtine in his booke of Virginitie hath manie words of the rewardes of matrimonie, &amp; concludeth thus, that eternall life is giuen of the Lord both to married &amp; vnmarried indifferently. The councell of Gangren thought good to make this canon,
                  An. 333. Can. 10.
                yt if any liuing ſingle for the Lord ſhould in arrogancie &amp; pride contemne thoſe yt were married, they ſhould be accurſed. Wherefore wee conclude this matter &amp; ſay as ye Church of God ſaid in yt time: Virginitie we cōmend,

I hope you ſée how the opiniō of chaſtitie to conſiſt only in liuing ſingle, ſprūg vp euen by the diuell, who knew not otherwiſe how to draw men to vncleannes, being robbed of his former means, than by making them to abridge themſelues of the ordinance of God againſt ye euil. You haue ſéene alſo how falſe this is, and that in godly matrimonie aſwel as in ſingle life there is liked chaſtitie of ye lord. You haue ſéene, yt neither of theſe eſtates haue any preminēcie aboue the other in reſpect of greater pietie, or merit, but both of them alike acceptable to God, if for the parties they be expedient, only in regard of outward incūbrances the one is more frée, thā the other. Laſtly you ſée ye vertue of this cōmandement oppoſed to adulterie to be chaſtitie, but how? not to liue vnmaried, as ye papiſtes dreame, but both in mariage, &amp; out of it, to kéepe body &amp; ſoule vnſpotted of filthie luſt &amp; concupiſcence. The other pointes of mariage it ſelf, of ſecond mariages, of poligamie, of diuorce, &amp; ſuch like, which were in this place to be handled, I think good to cut off, hauing taried alreadie too

                  ere we do cōſider it. Yea our negligence in this befalſe doth condemne vs before the Lord, and pronounceth againſt vs that wee feare more men than God. For our outwarde actions we are carefull of ſo néere as we can to kéepe the blottes of them out of ſight, but our heartes being thinges hidden from the eies of men, we cary litle care ouer them to kéepe them cleane from impure concepts. What man may ſée, we are aſhamed yt he ſhould ſée: but which God beholdeth our ſecret thoughtes, we feare

not at all to haue them foule, filthie and wicked. O what a God ſerue we, that being able to ſet euerie thought wee thinke viſible in our foreheads in great letters, that euerie one which runneth by, might reade them, yet moſt mercifully ſpareth vs, and is content our ſecret ſhame ſhould not appeare to men. Shall we ſtill prouoke him, ſhall wee ſtill offende and grieue him? Surely thē hotte wil be the wrath at laſt, which ſo long his mercie hath withhoulden. Wherefore to conclude this matter, euen as we loue the Lord and our owne health, let vs ſée and weigh how déepely this lawe againſt impure thoughtes is able to charge vs, let vs conſider the cauſe, if we can find it out, that driueth vs vſually into ſuch hidden ſinne, and héereafter as men touched with ſome Chriſtian remorſe, that ſo good a God ſhould ſo ſtill be offended, let vs ridde our heartes as we can of the effect, by taking away or at leaſt ſtopping in ſome meaſure the courſe of the cauſe. The meanes and allurementes either to the actuall offence, or the thought

                  
                     •
                  ondemned in this commaundement as we haue heard before, are many and diuerſe. Sometimes the eyes diſorderly wander, and beeing not checked by a Chriſtian conſcience that feareth to giue them libertie too long, they become the occaſions both of thoughtes and actes, wicked and damnable. Sometimes behauiour vnchaſt and vnſéemely. Someties ſpeeche wanton, and light ſtir the hart vp to conceiue that thing, and the wicked fleſhe to perfourme it fully, which God and nature abhorre as filthie. The dalying tattles of theſe courting dayes, the laſciuious ſonges made by looſe mindes, and the wanton gréetinges in euerie place nowe vſed, alas what thoughtes procure they neuer liked of the Lorde, that I may ſay no worſe? Bookes written by vnreformed heartes, and continually redde to the gréefe of God, are they no occaſions to fraile fleſh, both in thought and déede to offende againſt this law? God knoweth, and experience teacheth ſuch ſoules as ta

So are theſe ſtage playes and moſt horrible ſpectacles, ſo is our dauncing, which at this day is vſed, ſo is drunkenneſſe, gluttonie and idleneſſe, with a number ſuch like, as can witneſſe eche one in the world that will weigh them. Nowe what care we haue had of theſe things the Lord knoweth, and to our profite if we liſt a litle we may conſider it. Our eyes O Lorde, howe doe they offend through our careleſſe beſtowing of them to their owne deſire?

we count a quality commendable in vs, and the want of it we eſtéeme ſimplicitie, whereſoeuer we ſée it. And therefore by bookes to ſuch endes ſet out, we endeuour to attaine vnto it, and hauing once polluted our ſpéech (for I will neuer call it poliſhing) we are neuer better than when we haue company to beſtowe our tales and gréetinges vppon. Our apparell in matter to our power we make ſumptuous,
                     Apparell.
                   and in forme to allure the eye aſmuch as wee can. If this be true, in the name of Chriſt let vs better thinke of it than we haue done. Theſe are allurementes to ſinfull luſt, and this lawe of God forbiddeth not onely both act and thought, but euen euerie allurement to either of them. What ſhould I ſpeake of ſtage plaies and dauncing? Can we ſay in trueth before the maieſtie of God that we carefullie abſtaine from theſe thinges, becauſe they tickle vs vp either more or leſſe to the breach of this commanndement? Alas we cannot a number of vs. But we runne to the one continually to our coſt,
                     Playes.
                   when we will not be drawen

to better exerciſes that are offered fréely, we ſucke in the venom of them with great delight, and practiſe the ſpéeches and conueyances of loue which there we ſée and learne.
                     Dauncing.
                   The other wee vſe with eſpeciall pleaſure, and God being witneſſe to many an one, they wiſh the fruite of their dauncing to be this, euen the fall of them ſelues and others into the breache of this lawe. What ſhould I ſay of gluttonie and idlenſſe? Doe they not make vs ſinne? Good Lorde giue vs eyes to ſée,
                     Gluttonie and drunkenneſſe.
                   and hearts to weigh the occaſions of our fall. The ſpirite of God hath ſayde that theſe pricked vp the fleſh of the filthy Sodomites to that height of ſinne, and yet we can imagine they will cauſe no ſinne at all in vs againſt this lawe. And therefore profeſſing the goſpell and integritie of life, yet dare we ſo pamper, ſo ſtuffe, &amp; cramme this rebelling fleſh, as if we were gods that could ſuffer no temptation: we dare gull in wine and hote drinkes continually, beeing peraduenture both ſtrong and young, and euerie way néeding rather pulling downe, than ſetting

vp.
                     Idleneſſe.
                   We dare ſolace our ſelues in ſoft beddes too long for our conſtitutions, and all the day after betake our ſelues to nothing whereabout the minde might walke, and ſo eſcape impure conceptes. Wee dare differ the meanes which God hath appointed for our helpe to liue vndefiled, for euerie trifling cauſe, and féeling the fleſh to ariſe in diſobedience againſt this lawe euen dayly, yet neither faſt wee, nor breake our ſléepe, nor labour, nor marrie, nor any way ſtoppe the courſe of it. But certainely as vnféeling men paſſe on the time and heape vp wrath againſt the day of wrath for our boulde offending. And yet we hope to be ſaued, and yet we hope to haue a ioyfull reſurrection. But (O déere in the Lorde) it will not be ſo. For is not this the lawe of God, Thou ſhalt not committe adulterie? Doeth it not forbidde both act and thought as we haue plainely ſéene, and euen euerie allurement to either of them? And muſt not God iudge vs according to his lawe? Nowe then ſhould wee liue, when we haue witneſſe

within vs that wee offende his 
                     •
                  aw? Bée not deceiued, but as we feare the loſſe of bodie and ſoule for euermore, let vs be warned. Can nothing accuſe vs that hath béene ſayde? Did we neuer in act or in thought receiue anie ſtaine contrarie to this commaundement? Haue wee euer had care and power to auoide all meanes? What mouth dare ſpeake it, what heart can thinke it, if it be not braſſe or ſtéele, and as voyde of féeling? Wherefore awake let vs all from our former ſléepe, let vs ſtande vp at laſt from the dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, and Chriſt our déere Sauiour ſhall giue vs light. Let vs acknowledge what this lawe requireth, and what wee ſhould haue doone euerie one of vs. Let vs confeſſe we haue ſtraied frō it many a time &amp; way, and are no way able to offer vp our ſelues righteous, cléere, &amp; innocent to the Lord touching this lawe, and for the time to come that we ſhall yet liue héere, O let vs carrie ſome greater care to obſerue his will. We nowe knowe not our actes onely but our inwarde thoughtes

muſt euer be holy, we now knowe many meanes that leade to offence heerein, and that euen the meanes muſt alſo be eſchewed. Nowe then if we liue as in ignorance wee did, ſcorning at counſell, cleauing to our pleaſures, and reiecting the Lorde and his lawe, ſhall we eſcape? He that knoweth his maiſters will, and doth it not, ſhall hee be vnpuniſhed? Marke what I ſay, and pray euer to féele it as the wrath of the king bad heate the furnace ſeuen times hootter than e
                     •
                  er it was to conſume the men that withſtoode him to his face for truth: ſo ſhall the wrath of God, that made this lawe, cauſe hell to be hette 70 times 7 times hotter for vs, if wilfully after warning, and maliciouſly after knowledge we oppoſe our life againſt it. That is, he ſhall multiply the paines of hell vppon vs for theſe pleaſures of our fleſhe, that ſwéete ſinne may haue bitter and ſower confuſion for euermore. Nowe the God of heauen giue vs ſenſe and féeling, the Lorde of mercie touch vs with a taſte of ſinne by the viewing of his lawe. For

we cannot alwayes liue and thus dally with our owne ſoules, neither ſtandeth it with the nature of our God, who is iuſt finally to forgiue vs though he long forbeare vs, vnleſſe we amend. But he muſt haue his iudgement, and we muſt haue our torment as ſure as we liue. Nowe doeth hee wiſh vs to conſider our wayes, and to turne our feete into his teſtimonies, his warninges waſte, and his wrath increaſeth if wee ſettle our ſelues againſt him. Yet O howe I feare wee will wilfully doe it? For it is ſo ſwéete and ſo incident to vs which this lawe forbiddeth, that a thouſande to one we forſake the Lorde. The allurementes I haue named wee will neuer withſtande, no, wee will not heare of it that they cauſe vs to fall. But pleaſing this fleſhe for the time wee doe vſe them, wee will neuer eſpie the paine that will followe them. Yet why ſhould I feare ſince God is of power to pierce anie hart, and hath promiſed to doe it if wee heartily begge it? O Lorde I hope thou wilt worke

with vs, that by this lawe we may ſée howe we haue offended thée, and what héereafter we muſt more eſchewe, the one with ſorrowe and true remorſe, the other with faith and continuall care. Then ſhall thy Chriſt and our comfort, who in our fleſh fulfilled the lawe for vs, couer with his righteouſneſſe all our ſinnes againſt it. Then ſhall ſinnes paſt in his bloud be forgiuen, and wee by him euer héereafter ſtrengthened. Then we ſhall order our eyes with a carefull heart, we ſhall ſet a watch before our mouth and keepe the dore of our lippes, all falſe inticementes to forbidden luſtes wee ſhall gladly refraine, and ſo eſcape the ſinne it ſelfe the better. This I ſay good Lorde we ſhall doe, if thou worke with vs, that is, thou and thy power, and thou and thy mercie ſhall doe it in vs. Which voutchſafe O father of heauen for thy vnmeaſurable &amp; vnſearchable goodneſſe ſake. Amen.

               Anſ. Indéede no way: for it manifeſtly ouerthroweth ſo vile an imagination, and ſheweth ye diſtinction of dominions, &amp; propriety in things was, and is the ordinance of the Lorde. For euerie prohibition ſheweth an ordinance before eſtabliſhed, which ſhould be obſerued either in Gods lawes, or mans, though not alwaies expreſſely. As the forbidding of murther ſheweth preſeruation of life to be the wil of God, and the denyall of adulterie inferreth the liking of chaſtitie either in mariage, or out. So the forbidding of ſtealth which is an alienation of an other mans

goods to our ſelues, ſheweth that euery thing is not our owne to take at our pleaſure, but proprietie in poſſeſſion is the will of the Lorde. For if all thinges be common there can be no ſtealth, and ſo this law friuolous and to no purpoſe which God forbid we ſhould affirme or thinke.
            
               Que. Yet many haue bin of this opinion, affirming that tyranny, &amp; not diuinitie maketh this difference amongſt men.
               
            
            
               Anſ. It is verie true. Yet I hope you ſée how euidētly this law of God which I trow they will account diuinitie, doth ouerthrowe them and their folly, as do alſo all other lawes, that may héereunto be reduced with many ſcriptures mo. For as there can bee no ſtealth, if all thinges be common, and therefore this lawe of God as I ſaide in vaine giuen, ſo there can be no buying or ſelling, no borowing or lending, no letting or leaſing, or any ſuch thing amongſt men, if euery man haue like intereſt to take at his pleaſure, &amp; therfore the Lord God euen in theſe alſo greatly ouerſéene for yt he would troble himſelfe to make lawes

touching theſe matters, when as no mā hath or ought to haue anie proprietie in anie thing more than an other. Againe all the exhortations in the Scripture to almes déedes, and to mercie toward the poore is friuolous, for they haue as good right to take anie thing they want from anie man, as the other haue to giue them. But all theſe you ſée are abſurde, and therefore the opinion, and the contrary of it the wil and ordinance of the Lord.
            
               Que What is then the verie drift of this commandement?
               
            
            
               Anſ. The verie end of it is this, to bind our loue and care to our neighbors goods, as before it hath béene to his life, and things déere vnto him as his life. For it cannot bee, that our heartes ſhoulde bee right in affections towards our brethren, and wee ſpoylers and waſters, or anie way harmers of the commodities which they inioy. Loue chéeriſheth &amp; kéepeth euen euery thing ſo néere as it can, which he accompteth of, whome wee loue, and eſpeciallie which hee liueth by, and maintaineth

both himſelfe and others by. And therefore as I thinke we cannot take a better courſe to lay before our owne eyes yt wants of loue in vs towards the goods of our neighbors, and conſequently our breaches of this commaundement, than diligently to wey ſome particular dueties ſpecified in the worde, wherein the Lord God would haue our loue to ſhow it ſelfe. As for open rapine, and plaine ſtealth no man I thinke wil excuſe it or denie it to be ſinne, and therfore I ſtand not vpō it, your booke hath euident places quoted againſt it. I come rather to thoſe other duties of borowing and lending, of hyring and letting, of buying and ſelling, and ſuch like.
            
               Que. Firſt then what is the Lawe of borowing and lending in the worde?
               
            
            
               Anſ. If a man ſaith the lawe borow anie thing of his neighbour,
               
                  Exod. 22.14.
                
               and it bee hurt, or elſe die, the owner of it not being by, hee ſhall ſurelie make it good. If it be an hyred thing, he ſhal not make it good, for it came for his hyre. In which lawe, if wee well wey it, wee

may firſt ſée, that if we haue that thing, which our neighbour woulde borowe, and wee able without our hurt well to ſpare it him, we are bound to do it, or els we ſinne againſt this law of God, &amp; we euen ſteale from our brother, that which in right is his. For GOD woulde not euer haue made a lawe for recompence of the lender, if his thing lent receyue anie harme, vnleſſe it had béene a neceſſarie duetie of loue to lende when wee may. Therefore this narowneſſe of heart, and vnkinde diſpoſition, to grudge vnto anie that good, which by lending wee can poſſible doe him, it is hatefull in the eyes of God, and a playne breach of this commandement. Secondlie in this lawe, as one verie well hath noted,
                  Vſurie.
                we may ſée a great light giuen to that harde controuerſie concerning vſurie of monie.  For marke I pray you howe he ſaith in plaine tearmes, That if the thing were hired, although it periſhed in vſe, yet ſhould it not be made good by him which hired it, for it came for his hire. The monie which vſurers giue out is

hired as wee knowe. Therefore if

               In like maner ſhalt thou doe with his Aſſe, and ſo ſhalt thou doe with his raiment, and with all loſt thinges of thy brother which hee hath loſt, if thou haſt founde them, thou ſhalt not withdrawe thy ſelfe from them. Sée héere the loue of man to the goods of his brother in what ſort the Lorde requireth it. Nowe leaſt the name of brother vſed here in this place ſhoulde deceyue vs, to thinke wee are bounde but to our friendes in this duetie, it is profitable to note howe in an other place in ſtéede of brother is put enimie, and all theſe particulars neuertheleſſe named.

                   going aſtray, thou ſhalt bring him again, and ſo foorth of the reſt. So that this being a fruite of loue, which God requireth in vs all towardes the goods of all men, bee they friendes or foes, that wee ſhoulde kéepe them, and chéeriſh them, and in ſafetie reſtore them, if wee finde them loſt, when once wee knowe the owners of them: ſurely we muſt néede confeſſe that to conceile, and retaine thinges founde of vs, after wee knowe who ſhoulde haue them is plaine and flatte theft.

So that an equalitie of commodities preſent is plainely ſhot at in this law. How then can they warrant their dealings to haue required loue in them, who in reſpect either of paſſed loſſe or ſuppoſed poſſible in time to come, doe inhaunce the price of the thinges they ſell, aboue the value of the things? This dealing, if you marke the wordes well, could not be allowed amongſt the Iewes. And as yet I am ignorant of any larger cōmiſſion granted to vs to wrecke our ſelues vpon our brethren, &amp; to robbe thē becauſe God in his pleaſure hath croſſed vs with loſſe, or may do hereafter. Secondly it condemneth all vttering of naughty &amp; counterfeit coine or wares. For firſt for ye ſeller, if he raiſe his price to the value of good wares, &amp; then deliuer euill or counterfeit, how doth he obſerue an equalitie of commodotie? And then for the buier if he beat it downe to as low a price as he may, til be conſent to giue ſo much for it, and then deliuer counterfeit &amp; euill coine, where is again the equitie of this law on his part who is bound by it to giue aſmuch &amp; as good

as hee taketh ſo néere as iudgement can any way ſerue him. Thirdly it condemneth all lying in wayt to pray vpon one that muſt néeds ſell for preſent mony, to get his commoditie for halfe the value, if I can, when as rather I ſhould for pitie giue him equalitie. For what loue is this to the goods of my neighbor, when I can be content euen to robbe him in his neceſſitie by taking that for a penie that is worth in mine owne conſcience thrée, and not to be bought vnder, were his néede not ſo great? Nowe ſée and note then how commonlie, yet fearefully, for want of loue &amp; conſcience to giue as good as we take, our buying and ſelling one with an other is ſpotted &amp; ſtained with great and gréeuous theft. For moſt aſſuredly euen as in the time of law if they obſerued not a proportiō betwixt the Iubile yeare and their price, they offended againſt the commaundement of theft: ſo nowe the lawe béeing gone, if the equitie of it be not obſerued, to wit, equalitie of cōmoditie giuen and taken, the ſame ſinne is committed▪ in the day of the Lord we ſhall find th

burthen of it.
            
               Que. Thus then how ourloue ſhould ſhew it ſelfe in theſe common duties we may eaſilie ſee, nowe I pray you goe forwarde with other branches of this lawe.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Oppreſſion generally al, is contrarie to that loue, which the Lorde by this lawe ſéeketh to drawe out of vs, &amp; therefore no doubt forbidden in the ſame. And if in particulars wee liſt to lay it out, Firſt ſaith the worde, Thou ſhalt not oppreſſe an hired ſeruāt,
               
                  Deut. 24.14.
                
               that is needie and poore, &amp;c. But thou ſhalt giue him his hire for the day, neither ſhal the ſunne go down vpon it, for he is poore, and therewith ſuſtaineth his life, leaſt he crie againſt thee vnto the Lorde, and it bee ſinne vnto thee. Secondlie it forbiddeth to doe iniurie to any ſtrangers,
                  Exod. 22.21. Leuit. 19.33.
                or to oppreſſe them, and addeth this reaſon to the Iewes, becauſe they were once ſtraungers. Thirdlie you ſhall not trouble or oppreſſe anie widowe, ſaith the lawe, nor anie fatherleſſe child:
               
                  Exod. 22. v. 22.
                
               for if you doe, hee ſhall crie vnto mee ſaith the Lorde, and then mine anger ſhall burne, and I will kill you with the

ſword, and your wiues ſhalbe widowes, and your children fatherles. Where by the way marke the vehemencie of this ſpeach, and ſée what comfort to the godly, and terrour to ye wicked it may iuſtly exhibit. For the former, God knowes and the world ſées howe often they are wrecked and wronged and ſet to the wall by cruell, vngodlie, and harde hearted men, howe often they fayle of friendes to mayntayne their right, and defende their cauſe againſt the euill. But yet ſée héere a comfort, though all forſake vs, if wee crie to the Lorde, the cauſe ſhall bée his, and hee will helpe vs, the Lorde will awake and ſtirre vp his wrath, till the wrong wee haue ſuffered bee reuenged fullie. And for the ſeconde, what knowes the oppreſſing and mercileſſe man, whether anie cries paſſe from the gréeued heartes of ſuch as hee hurteth or no? If they doe, as it cannot be but they ſhould, why trembleth hee not to conſider what hangeth ouer his heade, euen readie to light vppon him euery hower, if God bee GOD and true of his

worde? O that our heartes then may cleaue to the Lorde if wee be oppreſſed, and tremble at his iudgementes if wee vſe it to others. But to returne to the matter againe, if all oppreſſion be ſtealth before God, what I pray you ſhal we thinke of the fountaine of much oppreſſion, to wit, acceptance of perſons in iudgement? Surely it muſt néedes alſo be euill before the Lorde. Reaſon doth teach it, and yet God for more aſſurance expreſſely forbiddeth it as a miſchiefe in a common wealth. The Lorde your God (ſayth Moſes) is God of Gods, and Lorde of Lordes,
               
                  Deutro. 10.7.
                
               a great God, mightie and terrible, which accepteth no perſons, nor taketh rewarde. Which doth right to the fatherleſſe and widowe, and loueth the ſtranger and giueth him foode and rayment. What alſo ſhall we thinke of one cauſe of acceptatiō of perſons to wit of bribes and rewardes, but euen alſo as the verie poyſon of iuſtice abhorre them and condemne them, &amp; the rather for that ſo expreſſely they are forbidden in the worde? Wreſt not the lawe (ſayth the

Lorde) nor reſpect not anie perſon, neither take rewarde.
               
                  Deutro. 16.19.
                
               For the rewarde blindeth the eyes of the wiſe, and peruerteth the wordes of the iuſt.
               
                  Exod. 23.2.
                
               That which is iuſt and right, ſhalt thou followe, that thou mayeſt liue, and poſſeſſe the lande which the Lorde thy God giueth thee. Thus then as branches of this commaundement, we ſée not onely oppreſſion generally, and particularly, but euen alſo the cauſes of it, acceptance of perſons, bribes, and rewardes, forbidden. And I wil yet adde one thing ouer vnto all theſe,
                  Liueries are often meanes and couers of oppreſſion.
                which muſt néedes be included in this head of oppreſſion, becauſe it is a cōmon and a dangerous cloake of the ſame, to wit, lyueries of Prince or ſubiectes, noble men, gentlemē, or whoſoeuer. Which if they maintaine and beare out the vniuſt &amp; wrongfull dealings of any man with ye knowledge of the Lord, not only the déede doer, but the giuer of that cloth and cote whatſoeuer he be, ſtandeth giltie of that oppreſſion before almighty God. The conſideration whereof being ſo true and ſure ſhould iuſtly cauſe in al eſtats, that

deale their cloth to others, a more vigilant eye &amp; eare to ſée &amp; heare the conuerſation of their folowers, &amp; a reſtraining hand of ſuch countenance, credite or couer to thē (all worldly reaſons ſet apart) when ſo euer they ſhall vnderſtande the ſame to be abuſed. For why ſhould any earthly reſpect euer ſtande ſo great in mens eies, as yt for it they dare take vpon them the guilt of other mens ſins, &amp; ſpoyling oppreſſion? But alas great is the vnféelingneſſe of many mens harts in this matter in theſe dayes. Either Pope, profite, or pollicie doe make vs deale our cloth too liberally, and regard our mens behauiour too negligentlie. But a worde is ynough.
            
               Que. Yet ſtill proceede on.
               
            
            
               Anſ. An other branch of this commandement of ſtealth is idleneſſe. For ſince the fall of our firſt parents, whatſoeuer we inioy iuſtly and truely as our owne, we muſt get it by labour. And whatſoeuer I labor not for, and yet inioy, I ſteale it, and the vſe of it belongeth not vnto me. For then was it ſayde to Adam and his poſteritie for

Otherwiſe if idlely he liue by the labour of others, hauing no teſtimonies that hee deſerueth his hire, be that man or woman whatſoeuer aſſured, that they make a breach o

               pes, by telling of fortunes, and ſuch like trades, mentioned in the ſtatute of this lande, touching vagabundes. For though they be labours, and make them 
                  •
               weate often, ſome of them, yet want they warrant in the worde to prooue them good, and lawefull labours. And therefore ſubiect to the penaltie of this lawe before God.
            
               Que. And I pray you let me adde one thing more becauſe you ſay all labours muſt be lawefull: what if a man in the purſuite of a pyrate or anie enemie in fielde get a ſpoyle, whether is it lawefull

to retaine it, and conceile it, or it is ſtealth ſo to doe? The labour is iuſt, honeſt and lawefull.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Truely I muſt néedes anſwere you, that albeit the labour in reſiſting, and repelling any enimie be commendable and good, and therefore goods ſo gotten lawfully poſſeſſed of the Prince, the léefetenant,
                  Gen. 14.
                the generall or chiefe whoſoeuer: yet is there no warrant that euerie ſouldier ſhould bee his owne caruer and take what he can get. But the cuſtome &amp; law of all well ordered wars is this, or ſhould be, that what ſpoyle ſoeuer is got, and not giuen before hand by the captayne to the ſouldiers, ought by them to be brought vnto him, and by him to be diſpoſed to euerie man geometrically that is according to euerie mans ſeruice and worthineſſe,
                  1. Sam. 30.20. &amp;c.
                no
                  •
                Arithmetically, that is to euerie man alike. And if anie man of his owne gréedineſſe alienate to himſelfe anie thing, any otherwiſe than thus, tha
                  •
                is, either with a generall guift of th
                  •
                captaine to take what he can, or a particular guift to take this and thus

much, ſurely that poſſeſſion is not warranted by Gods lawe, but lighteth vnder this commaundement. For as for a mans labour, firſt hee oweth 
                  •
               t both to God, and to his countrey, and then he hath his ſette pay for it, which hee agréeeth to as ſufficient, and therefore he ſhould not ſerue his gréedie affection diſorderly. As for the caſe of pyrates if vpon anie coſt they be taken and impriſoned, ſurely 
                  •
               t is verie barbarous crueltie to leaue them vtterly vncomforted, with anie portion of that which was taken a

               out them, and with them, euen ſo that for foode they ſtarue ere euer their cauſe bee hearde. This ſpoyle to

               ion and tender bowelles of pittie, which is required by the lawe of GOD. And therefore I include it, where no doubt the day of iudgement will finde it, euen within the forbidden

braunches of this commandement.
            
               Que. I take your anſwere, and therefore nowe followe your owne courſe againe.
               
            
            
               Anſ. It is nowe time to drawe to an ende, and there yet remaine to be ſome what touched the theft of the heart through gréedie couetouſneſſe, and the theft of the tongue by falſe and filthie flatterie. Wherefore a litle of theſe alſo as of the other. That this commandement then doeth reache vnto the thoughtes and inwarde conceits of the heart, it is firſt prooued by that reaſon, that often before hath béene alleadged, namely, becauſe the lawegiuer is ſpirituall, and therefore his lawes not reſting onely in outwarde actions, as mens lawes doe. Secondly by that ſpéech concerning adulterie, which is true in all the commaundementes, Hee that looketh,
               
                  Mark. 7.23.
                
               and luſteth, or coueteth, hath ſinned. And by the teſtimonie of our Sauiour Chriſt, who reckneth couetouſneſſe amongſt thoſe thinges that procéeding out, and not going in difile a man. To all which Chryſoſtome ſubſcribeth,

and ſayeth,
                  In Theſ. homilia 11.
                
               Auarus fur &amp; latro eſt. A couetous man is a theefe.
                Nowe what couetouſneſſe is albeit euerie man for the acquaintance that he hath with it, may knowe, yet doe I thus define it, to be a damnable vice of the mind, pricking and prouoking vs to followe after filthy lucre. Which thing without the name, and euen vnder the name, is maruelouſly inueighed againſt in the ſcripture.
                  Chap. 2.5.
                The prophet Habacuc cryeth out againſt the heart that inlargeth his deſire as the hell, and is as death, and cannot be ſatiſfied, but gathereth vnto him all nations, and heapeth vnto him all people. No, he that coueteth an euill couetouſneſſe to his houſe, that he may ſet his neſt on heigh to eſcape from the power of euill. Thou haſt conſulted ſhame to thine owne houſe by deſtroying many people, and haſt ſinned againſt thine owne ſoule. The ſtone ſhall cry out of the wall, and the beame of the timber ſhall anſwere it, wo to him that buildeth a towne by bloud, and erecteth a citie by iniquitie, and ſo foorth. It is cryed out againſt in the goſpell,

called the roote of all euill, idolatrie, and a thing not to be named amongeſt Chriſtians.
                  Luke. 12. 1. Timoth. 6. Epheſ. 5. Coloſſ. 3.
                There is no ſpeciall calling amongeſt men, whereunto by name this vice is not forbidden as a venome of all vertue, in euerie degrée in Princes, in iudges, in miniſters, in all it is forbidden, and ſurely this is no ſmall argument to a Chriſtian man againſt it. Fearefully puniſhed was it in Gehezi the prophets man, in Achan, and a number mo. And to conclude our ſcriptures Iob the ſeruant of the Lorde moſt notablie ſheweth,

                  De breuitate vitae.
                
               Omma tanquam mortales timemus, omnia tanquam immortales concupiſcimus, (ſayth Seneca.) That is, Wee ſtand in feare of diuers things as though we thought we could die, but we couet ſo as though we thought we ſhould neuer die.

                paynting out the filth of this follie to haue the bleſſinges of GOD, and yet to want no thing more through a miſerable minde, than the bleſſinges of GOD. But I will followe no further this common place: this litle which I haue

ſpoken, I haue doone it, to giue vs a taſt of this ſubtle ſinne, which, with griefe we may marke, thoſe men and women verie gréeuouſly aſſaulted withall and fearefully ouercome after their profeſſion made of Gods trueth, and his glorious goſpell, who in the dayes of their vanitie before their calling, neuer felt any ſuch temptation. So ſéeketh Sathan to ſlander the worde, and to hinder the credit of the goſpell. When he cannot longer detaine vs in ſwearing, in exceſſe of diet, or apparell, in adulterie and vncleanneſſe, in ſpoyling and ſpending waſtfully Gods giuen graces, and in other fruites of ignorance and of an vnreformed ſoule, then créepeth he in, and draweth vs ſubtlelie, ere euer wee eſpie him to the other extremitie, euen greater care to get, and nearer ſéeking howe to ſaue, than can or may ſtande with the credit of the trueth which we profeſſe, or calling often, which wee haue in the common wealth. This is too true, wee ſée examples daylie, and mens owne heartes being well examined ſhall confeſſe it. The Lorde then

giue vs iudgementes to ſée, and heartes to abhorre ſo foule an euill. For what a derogation from Gods promiſes, and damnable miſtruſt is this, when wee doe feare God, and ſerue him, attende to his worde, vſe his Sacramentes, forbid ſinne in others, and forbeare it our ſelues, then ſo to looke at wife and children, and other expenſes, as that we feare to want, who liuing before in a farre looſer ſort neuer doubted yet anie ſuch defect?

But to cut vs off from all recreation by any play (be it without offence of anie ſpoken) indéede they cannot. For wee are men, and no Angels, and as men in this worlde wee muſt walke our courſe, ſubiect to dulneſſe, and wearineſſe, euen in good thinges, and wee muſt refreſhe that féeble weakeneſſe of ours by lawful and allowed comforts. Which I ſo tearme becauſe I am aſſured that the worde of God condemneth not all our play, and the corrupt conſtitution of our bodies,

Sparing in truth is the worde in giuing,The appointing of feſtiual dayes. becauſe well knewe the Lorde wee woulde not bee ſparing in taking libertie for to play. Yet is it plaine inough.

                  •
               er anie thing leſſe, than Chriſtians. Theſe dueties therefore due to others,

ſo manie, and great, and theſe wants of neceſſaries for our ſelues, improoue our playing for monie. Laſtlie the iudgementes of men, both graue, godlie, and wiſe, who haue euer condemned it, ought in verie right to make all men leaue it. To thoſe that I named before wee may adde Peter Martyr, who giueth not leaue to the ſicke and weake in their houſes to plaie, but with this condition, that they play for no monie.
               
                  Modò pecuniae non periclitentur.
                And we may reaſon from Auguſtines facte, that if hee thought it euill to giue monie to a iugler, or a ſtage player, which yet to their payne, doe ſerue our ſenſes: much worſe is the warrant to giue to a gameſter, that playeth with vs, ſince hee laboreth no more to make vs ſport, than wee doe to make him. Much haue manie men writ, whence larger ſpeach may bee fetched, and o
                  •
                mee for a taſte let this ſuffice to bee ſaide.
            
               Que Why, but doe you thinke it ſimplie vnlawfull to play for monie?
               
            
            
               
               Anſ. Surely no. For when either ſo litle is playde as no way inableth mee to any dutie of my calling, or the money (not much) is beſtowed in ſome méeting, for the increaſe of loue, or that which is wonne, is a rewarde appointed to that exerciſe, then thinke I, with others, that it is lawefull. And thus much of theſe thrée queſtions, whether we may play or no, at what games, and whether for money.
            
               Que. Nay one thing more I pray you, and that is this. Whether make you like account of diſing that you doe of other games, and thinke it as tollerable?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No ſurely doe I not, to ſpeake plaine, but iudge it moſt vnſéeming for a Chriſtian man or woman, and a verie ſhame to the place where it is vſed. For of all games it hath neither wit in it, memorie in it, nor art in it, (but falſe art) nor exerciſe of anie thing, except it be the elbowe, nor any thing to commende it. And yet if this were all, it were not in ſo euil eſtate, howbeit, ſurely this is not a litle againſt it. But ſée (which is farre more) euen of all men

               The Application.
               
                  NOw, now my beloued to the worke of further fruit in our ſoules, let vs lay this rule to them &amp; them to it, and let vs euen heartilie I beſéech you euerie man ſecretlie betwixt God and vs ſée howe wee haue aunſwered in obedience this law of our God &amp; father mercifull &amp; almightie. We are bound by it generally to ſhowe all loue &amp; carefull regard to our neighbors goods that we poſſiblie can, &amp; to doe him with our owne goods what benefite we may. In particulars if we will ſpeake, we are bound to lend. We ſée both when and what we may, not hurting our ſelues, profite our neighbours withal, and to take no recompence, vnleſſe it be hurt which we lend. Now looke I ſay if you haue euer obſerued this thing without anie want. Haue you doone it? Nay haue you not often refuſed of a méere pinching &amp; an vnneighborly mind euen ſmall matters, when you haue béene verie earneſtlie intreated, adding often a lie to mende the matter withall &amp; ſaying

that you either had not that which indéede you had, or occupied it your ſelf, when indéede you did not. And haue you not often contrarie to the lawe of God made in this behalfe, taken reward, when the thing you lent receyued no harme? Surely your monie and manie thinges elſe doe witneſſe againſt you.
                     Pledges.
                   For the lawe of pledges and taking of pawnes, haue you neuer paſſed the bonds of loue, or the limites of mercy in that reſpect? Haue you neuer gone in to take what you could, but ſtoode at the dore to receiue what he might ſpare you? O that our haſtie handes, and harde heartes deſerued not the wrath which in trueth they doe in this one thing. Manie a time doe I greatly feare haue wee litle regarded the caſe of the partie, whoſe pawne wee tooke, ſo wee might bee ſafe our ſelues from our feared loſſe. And if it were ſo, ſurelie wee wanted loue and wee haue ſinned. Againe in the thinges commended to our kéeping,
                     Cuſtodie.
                   let vs looke alſo a litle howe wee haue ſatiſfied the lawe of God. Wée ſhoulde neither denie

for anie feare of harme thereby to kéepe for our neighbour, which wee may better than hee defende, neither conceile, hurt, purloyne or conuey away what euer anie truſt repoſed in vs, hath brought into our cuſtodie. But manie a dogged nature denyeth the former, and manie a couetous heart offendeth in the latter. What ſay you of thinges which you haue founde being loſt? Haue you euer regarded euen as your owne to kéepe it, to chéeriſhe it, and to finde out the owner of it, the ſtraying beaſt of your neighbour, and euen of your verie enimie? Haue you neuer either of negligence, or of malice and ſpite, or by a pinching minde tranſgreſſed herein? Conſider it well. And haue you neuer euen in the true teſtimonie of a good conſcience retayned anie thing, that euer you founde, from the true owner if you knewe him, neither euer neglected anie meanes to finde him out, if you knewe him not? Well were it with you if a priuie witneſſe within you did not crie and ſaie, that a gréedie couetous hart hath made

you often to offende in this duetie. Alas wee ſée it not, wée knowe it not, we féele it not to be a ſinne to retayne what wee finde, or almoſt to finde before it be loſt and ſo to conceyle it. So gapeth ech man after worldlie gayne, and ſo ſéeke we to haue howe ſo euer we haue it, if it happen into our hands, and wee well like of it. But ſinne will bee ſinne when ſuch gotten goods will no where bée ſéene, and the Lorde giue vs féeling of it nowe betimes. Next let vs looke of our buying and ſelling, wherein alſo all loue is to bee ſhowed to our brethren, and an equalitie kept ſo néere as wee can of commoditie giuen and taken. But howe manie of vs doe this, there is a God that knoweth, and a conſcience within vs, that if it were wakened woulde crie I feare mee lowde, we are gréeuouſlie guiltie. For where is that man or woman of trade almoſt to bee founde that taking vp a ſtanding in faire or Market doeth once thinke with themſelues that there they ſtande to ſhowe their loue to their brethren as to them ſelues,

and ſo to interchange their commodities with them, as that in the teſtimonie of a good conſcience and euen God being witneſſe, ſo néere as they can, they kéepe an equalitie giuing as good as they take, and taking no more than they giue in value and worth. No alas it is too well knowen and too much amongſt vs daily ſéene, that we thinke wee haue our ſtanding there to praie vppon all that come to vs ſo much as wee can, to deceiue them, to ſpoyle and robbe them in a ſort, and to get for our wares what poſſiblie wee may with an vtter neglect and refuſall of equalitie. And therefore we ſel as we may bee ſafe though wee neuer bee paide aboue halfe, wée ſell to day with a pinching price, wee make accompt God maie ſende vs ſome loſſe, and therefore betimes we wrecke our ſelues vppon our brethren, and ſo take of them for that which wee doe ſell, as that if it happen that GOD doe ſo deale with vs, wee may bee reuenged before hande, and able to abide it if it bee not great. To conclude, we

are merieſt when we haue robbed moſt, and then goe wee ſinging home when wee haue giuen occaſion to the moſt to crie. So dull and deade are our heartes within vs, and ſo hath a gréedie minde to rake vp riches ſpoyled vs of loue or any thought thereof towards our brethren. And as litle conſcience there is often in the buyer, who if hee might haue for a pennie that is worth a pounde, coulde well inough digeſt it. And therefore if one in hys néede come vnto vs for preſent monie, wee will none of his commoditie, wée want it not, wee eſtéeme it not, wée looke lightlie both of the man and the matter till wee haue brought him to our owne price, and God knowes farre farre vnder the value of the thing. So that hee which of charitie in his néede ſhoulde bee helped, is of vs commonlie by reaſon of his néede prayed vppon and moſt cruellie robbed. And yet we be no théeues. Ah, God be mercifull to vs &amp; awake vs and neuer deale with vs according to our iniquities for his Chriſtes ſake. But paſſe wee nowe on

But I paſſe them ouer, and remember vnto you, that pretie ſaying of the godlie father S. Chryſoſtome,
               
                  Chryſoſt. de communi ſermone.
                ſo fitly at this time confirming my perſwaſion. There are two thinges (ſayth hee) neceſſarie for thée as thou art a Chriſtian man and woman, to wit, a good conſcience and a good name, the former for thy ſelf, the later for thy neighbour. But alas (ſaith an other) Plures famam,
               
                  Plin. lib. 3.
                
               pauci conſcientiam verentur. Manie are afraide of the touch of their fame, but fewe of the hidden breach of their conſcience. Adde vnto theſe if you liſt, alſo the iudgementes of the heathen, and firſt of him whoſe words be theſe:
                  Cic. offi. 3.
                there is nothing ſo great, neither any commoditie in the worlde ſo of thée to be eſtéemed and deſired, as that for it thou ſhouldeſt blemiſh the beautie and brightneſſe of the good name of a good man. For deſire euer ſayth an other, rather to heare well,

than to be rich: yea preferre it in thy heart to leaue vnto thy poſteritie an honeſt report and name, before heapes of anie riches whatſoeuer. For riches are ficle and ſoone diſperſed, but a good report is permanent and neuer dyeth. Againe by a good name may wealth bee gotten, but not againe by wealth a good name. Laſtly riches are common to the good and bad, but a good report is proper onely to the good.
            
               Que. And howe may a man or woman beſt breede a good report of them?
               
            
            
               Anſ. Ageſilaus was once aſked the ſame queſtion, and he made this aunſwere. If thou ſpeakeſt euer what is the beſt, and doeſt the thing that is moſt honeſt. Socrates thus: if from thy heart thou indeuour in all truth to be, as thou deſireſt euer to be thought to be. For a fame that is gotten by giftes or hypocriſie, will neuer indure, but periſhe. Wherefore nowe if the worde of God, the teſtimonies of his children, and the 
                  •
               erie light of nature in heathens haue euer ſo commended a good name, iudge

we heereby, if we wilbe taught what a ſinne it is to be a falſe witneſſe againſt this preciouſe treaſure and iewell of my neighbour, his good name. Iudge we what a monſter before the face of God he is, that for the ſatiſfaction either of his owne or other mens curſed natures ſéeketh to depraue, to bite, and ſlander any man wrongfully, be the diſcredite he worketh neuer ſo ſmall. And thus much for my firſt reaſon.
            The ſeconde I drawe from the puniſhment which hath vſually hapned vnto this vice either by gods expreſſe commaundement amongeſt the Iewes or ſecret working in the heartes of magiſtrates in other places. For verie effectually haue I euer thought bewrayed by theſe thinges the foulneſſe of falſe witneſſe bearing. The lawe of God ſayde thus:
                  Deut. 19.16. &amp;c.
                
               If a falſe witneſſe riſe vp againſt a man to accuſe him of treſpaſſe: Then both the men which ſtriue together ſhall ſtande before the Lorde, euen before the prieſtes and the iudges which ſhalbe in thoſe daies. And the iudges ſhall make diligent inquiſition, and if

the witneſſe be founde falſe, and hath giuen falſe witneſſe againſt his brother, then ſhall ye doe vnto him as he hadde thought to doe vnto his brother, ſo thou ſhalt take euel away forth of the middeſt of thee. And the reſt ſhall heare this and feare, and ſhall henceforth commit no more anie ſuch wickedneſſe amongeſt you. Therefore thine eie ſhall haue no compaſſion, but life for life, eie for eye, tooth for tooth, hande for hande, foote for footh. A meruelous lawe, if the ſpirite of féeling worke withall to print in vs for euer a true conceite of the perfect hatred wherewith God abhorreth falſe witneſſe bearing. Beſide which lawe marke what Salomon ſayeth:
                  Prou. 19.5.
                
               A falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, and he that ſpeaketh lies ſhall not eſcape. For howſoeuer the lande of the Lorde which is euer full of mercie, and long ſuffering euen towardes the wicked, may ſpare them for a time, yet in the 
                  •
               nde with ſharpeneſſe of his rodde will 
                  •
               e recompence the long differring of it. And what maruell, if we marke the na
               
                  •
               ure of the ſinne? For doeth not a falſe

witneſſe, abuſe the iudge, hurt his neighbour, make the place of iuſtice and right, the nurcerie of ſinne and gréeuous wronges, doth he not cauſe the Lorde to ſet in the eies of men the crowne of innocencie, vpon the offenders heade, and to put the halter about the iuſt mans necke? Than the which diſhonor, what can be greater againſt the Lorde of life, and louer of right, to pul vpon vs his heauie hande? Pericles an heathen man could ſay, we muſt be a friende to our friende no further than the altar. That is, no further than GOD and a good conſcience guided by his worde may warrant vnto vs. But wee in theſe daies eſtéeme not a ſtrawe of that man or woman, that will ſticke to lend vs an othe at anie time, when we ſtand in néede be the matter neuer ſo falſe and foule. For hee is no friende which is not euer a friende, to féede our filthie humour with all wicked and wrongfull vſage of himſelfe. But woe vnto vs wicked wretches for ſo great and gréeuous ſinne againſt the Lorde, and alſo our ſelues. For doe I not tremble

               Que. But I haue often heard a diſtinction of lies, as ſome to bee merie lies made in ieſt, ſome to bee lies of dutie made to doe my friende a pleaſure in his daunger, and ſome to be lies of ſpite made to hurt others thereby. I pray you what thinke you of it?
               
            
            
               
               Anſ. For the firſt manie goe about to excuſe them and to diminiſh the fault of them, becauſe they intende no euill to the parties to whome they are tould. But we heard before what both Auguſtine, and Gregorie ſayd, namely, that all lying is ſinne, and yet it hath a ſtronger checke than this. For if wee make the beſt of it we can, it is but an idle and a fruteleſſe ſpéech,
                  Math. 12.
                whereof we knowe we muſt giue account. And againe,
                  Pſalm. 5.6.
                
               The Lorde ſhall deſtroy them all (ſayth the Pſalme) that ſpeake lies, adding no diſtinction of merie lies from the reſt: and where the lawe diſtinguiſheth not, we may not diſtinguiſh. The ſeconde ſort manie goe about to allowe and iuſtifie, bringing in for warrant the lie of Rahab, of Abraham, of the midwiues and ſuch like, made for the ſafetie of life. But touching them all and howe manie moe ſoeuer as may bee brought like vnto theſe, I anſwere as one ſpeaketh particularly of Abraham, Non videtur mihi laborandum, omnino v
                        •
                      Abrahamum defendamus: homo enim fuit &amp; nimio timore potuit labi: &amp;c.
                That is,

               I thinke it altogether needeleſſe to goe about to defende Abrahams lie, for hee was a man, and through too much feare he might offende. And ſo ſay I of all the reſt, they were faultes in them and blemiſhes, and offended God. And concerning the midwiues lie Auguſtine plainely ſayeth, that their feare of God and tender care mercifully to ſpare the infantes pleaſed God, but not their lie. If this doe not content vs, then remember the ſame Auguſtines iudgement before in generalitie that it is not lawfull to lie, though it could be to the praiſe of God, ſurely then not for any mannes helpe.
                  Iob. 13.7.
                Remember the wordes of Iob who checked in his friends a falſe ſpéech although it tended to defende the Lorde. And remember the wordes of Chriſt himſelfe howe he maketh the deuill the 
                  •
               ather and author of all lies whatſoeuer without diſtinction.
                  Ioan. 8.
                If we feare to bewray the man or matter, which wee would not, then hide the trueth (ſaieth S. Auſten) but in no caſe ſpeake an vn

               rueth. For the laſt ſort of lies nothing 
                  •
               s ſayde of any to excuſe it, for euerie

conſcience cryeth it is a ſinne. And therfore nowe I conclude, one kinde of lie is worſe than an other, but all naught, and of a Chriſtian man and woman euer to be forborne to their powers. The hyperbolicall ſpéeches in the ſcripture are euer truethes in matter and meaning,
                  Veritas non reiſed rationis.
                though not in wordes and forme, as I may ſay. For modeſtie ſake neither may wee lie, in any caſe. But as Ariſtotle pretilie ſayth: Declinet veritas nonnihil ad defectum, cum de ſe quis loquitur. That is as I interpret it, When a man ſpeaketh of himſelfe, let him ſpeake ſparingly, but not falſely.

What I pray you might meane this repetition of wordes, to ſéeke, to ſearch, to inquire, and that diligently, but to admoniſh vs what a fault it is to condemne before we knowe, and to beléeue what euer we heare by and by?

                he might not be put to death vpon the teſtimonie of

that one, but at the mouth of two or three witneſſes ſhall he that is worthie of death, die, (ſayth the Lawe) all to teach vs that we may not be light of beléefe, when we are whiſpered in the eare againſt a man, and by and by kill him in our heartes by ceaſing to thinke well of him any more vppon one reporters ſpéech. For to robbe him of that credite in my heart, that hee had before with me, vnleſſe he deſerue it, is a branch of murther as hath before béene prooued. Againe as Salomon ſayth of anſwering a matter before a man heare it, that it is follie and a ſhame to him that doth it: ſo ſay we and thinke we of beléeuing a matter before we knowe it,
                  Prou. 18.13.

                  2. Sam. 16.1.
                But what ſhould I heape vp examples?

May not euen euerie mans conſcience tell him, that the fault is not litle, the diſcredite whereof God hath left vnto vs but in one example? I conclude therfore this matter of light beléeuing ſuch tales as vngodlily and falſely are made vnto vs with the ſpéech of wiſe and experienced Syrac in his booke. Blame no man (ſayth he) before thou haſt inquired the matter, vnderſtande firſt,
               
                  Syrac. 11.7.
                
               and then reforme righteouſlie, giue no ſentence before thou haſt heard the cauſe, neither interrupt men in the middeſt of their tales. God giue vs the vſe of it. For great is the hurt of light beléefe both towardes bodie and alſo ſoule.
            
               Que. Yet there remaineth one thing more in the booke.
               
            
            
               Anſ. It is true, and that is this. In priuate offences to ſpeake anie thing (although it be true) to the hurt of our brothers good name, if by priuate admonitions he may be wonne, is a branche and a breach of this commaundement. The Apoſtle Peter prooueth it, when he ſayth thus, But aboue all thinges haue feruent loue among you. For loue couereth

a multitude of ſinnes. Paule prooueth it in like wordes alſo:
                  1. Petr. 4.8.
                
               Loue ſuffereth all thinges,
               
                  1. Cor. 13.7.
                
               it beleeueth all thinges, it hopeth all things, it indureth al things. If therefore we loue our brother, there wilbe a care we plainely ſée, that we vtter nothing to the hurting of his good name. And if there bee but anie wiſedome in vs (ſaith Salomon) we will be carefull of it alſo.
                  Prou. 11.12.
                
               For he that deſpiſeth his neighbour is deſtitute of wiſedome, but a man of vnderſtanding will keepe ſilence. But to ſtrike vp the matter fully we ſée the wordes of our Sauiour Chriſt in the goſpell plaine:
                  Math. 18.15.
                
               If thy brother treſpaſſe againſt thee, goe and tell him his fault betwixt him &amp; thee alone: if he heare thee, thou haſt wonne thy brother:
               
                  16.
                
               But if he heare thee not, take yet with thee one or two, that by the mouth of two or three witneſſes euerie worde may be confirmed.
               
                  17.
                
               And if he will not vouchſafe to heare them, tell it vnto the Church: and if he refuſe to heare the Church alſo, let him be vnto thee as an heathen man and a publican. Héere we plainely ſée, that priuate offences are

not to be made openly knowen, ſo long as there is hope of amendement. But remember I ſay that we ſpeake of priuate offences, for in publike faultes there is quite an other courſe, euen openlie to rebuke them that haue openlie ſinned,

               Anſ. Eaſily may we gather one contrarie by an other, for who ſéeth not, that if all falſehood be forbidden in generall, likewiſe all trueth by the ſame wordes is commanded? As therefore no way we ought to doe the former, ſo by all meanes we ſhould maintaine the latter. And namely in the deliuerie of anie doctrine, in place of iuſtice,
                  Prou. 14.25. Pſalm. 15.
                and iudgement, in contractes, couenantes, and bargans, in our ſpéeches, in our actions, and euerie where and way is trueth to be maintained and ſhowed of vs.
                  Cic. 1. Offi.
                For man is borne to trueth, and by nature we haue to inquire

after it. Man is borne to knowe God, to conſider the creatures, to preſerue the difference betwixt honeſtie, and diſhoneſtie, and what is this but trueth? Man is borne to learne and knowe ſuch artes, as God hath brought into our practiſe, and euerie art ſéeketh a trueth. Therefore a ſhame and a diſcredite wee ſhould euer thinke it to bee founde vntrue, yea euen ſo farre wee ſhould thinke we are degenerated from the nature of man, as we are led with any liking of falſehoode and vntrueth. It is a notable place of Zacharie to ſhew vs the great liking which the Lord hath of trueth, and howe he deſireth it in all godly men and women euer. For theſe are the thinges that ye ſhall doe (ſayeth the Lorde) Speake yee euerie man the truth vnto his neighbour, execute iudgement truely and vprightly in your gates, and let none of you imagine euill in your heartes againſt his neighbour, and loue no falſe othe, for all theſe are the thinges that I hate (ſayth the Lorde.) Zacharie 8.16. And if we weigh with this againe and manie ſuch other teſtimonies

that might be brought ye ſentences of the godlie Fathers, euen thereby alſo may we gather greatly the excellencie and precious account that all good men ſhould make of ſpeaking trueth. For if anie man be offended for a trueth (ſayth Auguſtine) 
                     Ʋtilius ſcandalum permittitur, quam veritas amittitur.

               That offence were better ſtill to be, than that to remoue it anie loſſe ſhould be made of the trueth. And in an other place againe, To ſtriue or fight againſt a knowen truth paſſeth in euill euen idolatrie,

                and ſay thus. That if he did it vpon anie diſtruſt, doubt or feare that GOD would not or could not deliuer him in that diſtreſſe from the danger that was imminent, then did he ſinne no queſtion verie greatly, but if his heart reſted vpon God in aſſuraunce of his mercifull eie and hande watching ouer him and defending him euer, and did vſe that diſſimulation, but as the meanes that then he could, becauſe hee would not tempt God, then did he well, and yet that his doing is no warrant to breake this commaundement, by reiection of trueth and following a falſehoode in anie of our particular dealinges aboue

named.

               Anſ. No indéede, no color of honeſtie, pietie, friendſhippe and loue, or anie good thing, vnleſſe indéede it be there. For both God and man abhorreth all ſuch colors. And it ſhould euer be the ſpéech of anie Chriſtian man or woman whileſt they liue,

               and that in truth that their reioycing is this, the teſtimonie of their conſcience, that in ſimplicitie and godly pureneſſe and not in fleſhly wiſedome, but by the grace of God they haue had their conuerſation in the world as Paul ſayde to the Corinthians of him ſelfe.
            
               Que. What if I ſet no falſe colour on, but onelie conceile a trueth and ſay nothing?
               
            
            
               
               Anſ. It hath béene ſhewed before that in ſome caſes and times it is lawefull ſo to doe, as by name, when it may ſtande both with my loue to God and my brother. But if it be contrarie to both theſe, or to either of theſe, then is it wicked and vngodly. And then (ſayeth the holy ghoſt) The fearefull ſhall haue their portion in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone,
               
                  Apoc. 21.8.
                
               which is the ſeconde death. And Hieroms compariſon is good if we may not for our life denie anie way a trueth, much leſſe aſſuredly for leſſer cauſes. Yea be readie euer (ſayth Peter) in matters of faith to giue an account of the hope that is within you,
                  2. Petr. 3.
                to anie that ſhall aſke you a reaſon thereof.
            
               Que. You promiſed before to adioine in the ende, ſome moe examples of gods iuſtice vpon this ſinne of falſe witneſſe bearing, and nowe if you will, you may perfourme it, and ſo conclude this commaundement, for in all thinges elſe I am ſufficiently ſatisfied.
               
            
            
               Anſ. Firſt conſider the puniſhment

alotted to it by expreſſe worde of the Lorde, in this worlde euen to reape by iuſt ſentence of the iudge, whatſoeuer he by his falſe witneſſe had thought to haue brought vpon an other, life for life, hande for hande,
               
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉

               eie for eie, tooth for tooth, foote for foote, without anie pitie or ſparing, and in the world to come euerlaſting death. Then if you will remember alſo what Euſebius writeth of the accuſers of Narciſſus Byſhoppe of Hieruſalem: Howe thrée euill diſpoſed perſons that ſéeing the ſoundeneſſe and graue conſtancie of his vertuous life, and fearing their owne puniſhment (as a conſcience that is guiltie, is alwayes fearefull) thought to preuent his accuſations with a great othe, one wiſhing to be deſtroyed with fire, if he ſaide not true, the other to be conſumed with gréeuous ſickneſſe, the thirde to looſe both his eies if they did lie. Narciſſus although hauing his conſcience cleare, yet not able being but one man to withſtande the accuſation bounde with ſuch othes, gaue place, and remoued himſelfe from the multitude into a ſolitarie deſert

by himſelfe, where he continued by the ſpace of manie yeares. In ye meane time to them which ſo willingly and wickedly foreſware themſelues this hapned. The firſt by caſualtie of one litle ſparke of fire, was brent with all his goods and familie. The ſeconde was taken with a great ſickneſſe from the toppe to the toe, and deuoured with the ſame. The thirde hearing and ſéeing the puniſhment of the other confeſſed his fault, but through great repentance powred out ſuch teares, that he loſt both his eies. And thus was their falſe periurie and witneſſe bearing puniſhed. Narciſſus after long abſence returning home againe was by this meanes both cleared of his fact, and reſtored to his biſhopricke againe. An other good ſtorie to this ende is that of king Canutus the Dane, who beeing eſtabliſhed in the kingdome, cauſed a parliament at London, where (amongeſt other thinges there debated) it was propounded vnto the Byſhoppes, Barons, and Lordes of the parliament there preſent, whether that in the compoſition made betwixt

               Edmonde and Canutus anie ſpeciall remēbrance was made for the children or brethren of Edmond for anie partition of any part of the land. Whereunto the Engliſh Lordes falſely flattering with the king, &amp; ſpeaking againſt their owne mindes as alſo againſt their natiue countrey, anſwered and ſaide, nay: Affirming moreouer with an othe for the kinges pleaſure, that they to the vttermoſt of their powers would put off the bloud of Edmond in all that they might. By reaſon of which anſwere and promiſe, they thought (manie of them) to haue purchaſed with the king great fauour. But by the iuſt retribution of God it chanced farre otherwiſe. For manie of them, or the moſt part, ſuch ſpecially as Canutus did perceiue to be ſworne before time to Edmonde and his heires, and alſo conſidering that they were natiue Engliſh men, hee miſtruſted and diſdayned euer after. Inſomuch that ſome he exiled, a great ſort he beheaded, and ſome by Gods puniſhment dyed ſodainly. Sée therefore the heart and hande of the Lorde againſt a

falſe witneſſe. Many hiſtories are there to this ende. And manie experiences euen nowe adaies of gods iuſt plagues vpon this ſinne. But I will not runne ouer them nowe. Eaſilie may they be turned too in our owne Church ſtorie. Onely theſe two I cannot omit. Firſt how Hamelton the Scot being brought vnto his death by the falſe accuſation of a falſe Frier called Campbell, when he was in the fire cited and ſummoned the ſayde Frier to appeare before the high God as generall iudge of all men to anſwere to the innocencie of his death, and whether his accuſation was iuſt or not, betwixt that and a certaine day of the next moneth, which hee there named, and ere that day came the Fryer died without any remorſe of conſcience, that he had perſecuted the innocent. And ſecondly howe Calice men in the daies of King Henrie the 8. being falſely accuſed eſcaped ſafe from the danger of ſuch witneſſes, and they themſelues (a iuſt plague vppon their iniquitie) hanged, drawen, and quartred, ere they went home. Therefore let vs euer tremble

to prouoke the Lorde by this ſinne, let vs ſpeake a trueth if we doe ſpeake at all, and ſhame to lie euen of the deuill. The daily beggeries, diſcredits, ſhames and deathes, ſtrange and fearefull of ſuch as haue made no conſcience by falſe witneſſe bearing to pollute their conſciences ought mightilie to moue vs, and verie effectually to perſwade vs neuer to doe it. For God to vs as he hath béene to others will moſt aſſuredly ſhew himſelfe either at firſt or at laſt, at one time or other, when our ſinne is the ſame and he no changeling in his nature at all. And thus much of this commaundement.
            
               The Application.
               
                  NOwe let vs weigh the guilt or innocencie of our ſoules, if the Lorde ſhould call vs to an account for this his lawe. Generallie wee ſée the care that ſhould be in vs to preſerue the

credite, and good name of all men, and what heart ſo dull or dead, and paſt all féeling that it doth not eſpie euen a generall want in it ſelfe, concerning the ſame? Generally all trueth would the Lorde by this lawe haue loued, cheriſhed, and maintained, and the contrarie hated, ſhunned, and auoyded, but what eie ſo blinde, that cannot ſée the courſe we commonly take, and the race wee wholy runne to the maintaynaunce of the vice, and rooting out almoſt of the vertue from amongeſt vs? But conſider the particulars one by one, and ſo ſhall we reape moſt profit. Haue you neuer in all your life teſtified of your neighbour an vntrueth publikely, for fauour, or gaine, or hatred, or any cauſe whatſoeuer? Haue you neuer ſlipped neither in your owne behalfe, nor your friendes, nor your towne and liberties, nor anie way? But haue euer dealt in all the teſtimonies that euer you gaue as you dare abide gods ſearching eie to iudge you? Conſider well the matters that you haue dealt in, remember the times paſt, remember the ſutes that

haue béene made vnto you, and peraduenture the rewardes that haue béene offered you alſo, and if you be cleare and no way to be touched, though God ſift you neuer ſo narrowly, be glad and giue God praiſe. But if you can not, if you may not, if you dare not cleare your ſelfe, both becauſe a guiltie conſcience accuſeth you within, and becauſe both men and matters may be produced, and named, for whom and wherein affection hath led you, giftes corrupted you, malice incenſed you, &amp; ſin ſtayned you, then ſée it, ſée it in the feare of God, and thinke of it, confeſſe it was naught, acknowledge your blemiſh, conſider this lawe that ſo flatly forbiddeth it, tremble vnder the hande of the God of heauen, that hath euer plagued it, either by one way or an other, in a mans ſelfe or his ſéede, in this worlde or the other. And ſo by the grace of God ſhall ſight bréede ſorowe, and amendment of life hereafter. Fie of that affection that damneth our ſoules, wo worth the gaine, that getteth vs hell. And accurſed is that iuror and witneſſe, that ſo reſpecteth his preſent

purpoſe, as that hee caſteth away the care of God, of life, of hell, of death, of ciuill honeſtie, fame and good name in his countrey and dwelling, neuer able after to come in companie where hee may not feare the touch in talke of his ill dealing. Certainely certainely if a good name be aboue gould and ſiluer, a falſe witneſſe is the droſſe and dregges of the world that the Lorde hateth and euerie honeſt heart verie perfectly loatheth. The next branch that breaketh our obedience and dutie to the Lorde in this lawe is lying,
                     Lying.
                   the foule filth whereof hath in part before béene diſplaied and opened. And nowe it remaineth but to conſider our courſe and how gréeuouſly guiltie we are before God of this ougly vice. Where is that man, that woman, that aged or younger, that will cleare themſelues from all blotte or ſtaine in this behalfe? Doth not euerie maiſter in his man, euerie miſtres in her maide finde it, miſlike it, hate and abhorre it? Doth not euerie eſtate finde it in other? And God in vs all to the iuſt incenſing of his wrath and furie againſt

vs? If we can cleare our ſelues let vs, if we can not where is our righteouſneſſe, where is our perfection, where are our merites? Nay why dread we not the death that is the deſert of lying lippes? O ſift and ſearch the guilt of guilefull tongue, couer it not, excuſe it not, remember what I haue ſayde of it before, mocke not God, dallie not with your damnation, hate to bee the childe of the foule fiende, and with ſorowe in trueth for paſſed ſecuritie, flie with perſeuerance for euer hereafter ſo ſinfull iniquitie. Truth may be blamed, but it can neuer be ſhamed, yea euen man in the ende ſhall like it, and God for euer bleſſe it and crowne it. There followe then in the booke as particulars of this generall flattering,
                     Flatterie, &amp;c.
                   and diſſembling, and telling falſe tales behinde our neighbours backe. Concerning the firſt what ſhould I ſay? Should I aſke whether you haue or doe offende? ſhould I make a queſtion of it, or bring you into doubt with your ſelfe whether you haue héerein faulted, or no? Alas howe want I rather words to moue vs

to repentance than proofes of dayly practiſe to conuict vs of tranſgreſſion? Helpe Lord,
                  
                     Pſalm. 12.
                   helpe may I truly ſay with Dauid, for good and godly men doe periſh and decay, and faith and trueth from worldly men is parted cleane away. Who ſo doeth with his neighbour talke, his talke is all but vaine, for euerie man bethinketh how to flatter, lie, and faine. But what followeth? Certainely euen that which we ſhall finde if God by his grace change not our heartes to more ſinceritie. For we make no conſcience to lie, to flatter, to fawne, to halt, to 
                     •
                  ogge, to gloſe, and diſſemble honeſtie, pietie, friendſhippe, and fauour, loue, and obedience, faithfulneſſe and truſt, and whatſoeuer may be profitable to vs euen from morning to night, from we riſe till wee goe to bed, and then howe ſhould we eſcape and yet God be iuſt too? It is euen the wiſedome we extoll in others and that we ſtriue continually to attaine vnto our ſelues, to haue neither 
                     •
                  rue eie, true heart, nor true tongue, but onely to ſéeme to haue all to euerie one, whoſe worde, wealth, or authoritie,

may gaine vs anie thing in this curſed worlde. And ſo man is our ſtrength, our pollicie is our GOD, fleſh is our arme, and what Paul ſo reioyceth in, we laugh at, as vile and too ſily ſimplicitie. Dauid aſſureth himſelfe the Lorde will defende them that are true of heart,
                     Pſalm. 7.11. Pſalm. 32.11. Pſalm. 36.10. Pſalm. 64.10.
                   we verily thinke if we be true of heart wee cannot, nor ſhall not be able to liue in the worlde, we muſt Critiſare cum cretenſibus, that is, we muſt ſmooth it, and ſooth it, and carie two faces vnder one hoode, or elſe wee are not ſo wiſe as we might be. Thus ſinne we I am ſure of it, ſome more and ſome leſſe, and the reward of the leaſt ſinne, is eternall death. But it is the Lordes great mercie to moue vs from anie ſinne. For dull are our heartes to feare any iudgement, till it be vpon vs.
                     1. Iohn. 1.7.
                   And therefore to him I commende vs to open our eies, that we may euen earneſtly ſée and conſider effectually, howe impoſſible anie feloweſhippe is euer to be had for me holowe, ſubtill, guilefull, hypocriticall, and ſ

it ſelfe. For the ſeconde which was telling of tales, wee haue heard it before ſhewed, and our owne knowledge doth aſſure vs it is a branch of the breach of this commandement, which ſhall burne both bodie and ſoule in the fire of hell. And yet ſée, do we feare it, or flie it? Alas we knowe I am ſure of it, we haue béene too too ſecure in this point, and our ſecuritie not ſéeing and weighing the wickedneſſe of the vice hath ſtayned both heart and tongue horriblie. Looke about the worlde and veiwe the generall courſe of all. Feareth anie man to diſcredite his neighbour priuily, and to whiſper vpon heareſay or his owne imagination what tendeth to the blemiſh of his name whom he ſpeaketh of? Feareth any woman when ſhee hath mette with her goſſippe to tittle tattle, to the ſlander of an other, this thing and that thing, which yet hath no certaintie, and which full both ſhe would haue ſaide of her ſelfe vpon like coniectures? No 
                     •
                  o we ſée to much the curſed courſe of lawleſſe tongues in euerie place, though the Lorde in mercie giueth ſome conſciences,

and a thouſande times I begge that we would ſée our ſinne, confeſſe our ſinne, and rippe vp our guilt in this reſpect. Why ſhould wee be ſo dull and without féeling? If it be a vertue thus to prittle and prattle of euerie bodie vncertaine tales, but moſt certaine diſcredites, then prooue it ſo and vſe it: but if it bee a branch of falſe witneſſe that doth truly witneſſe gods wrath to hang ouer vs for it, good Lorde, ſhall we ſtill be polluted with it? Shall hell haue vs without anie helpe? Will not the dread of dolefull day ſtrike ſuch a filthie fault into the waning, and by litle and litle cut quite the throte of it, and make it bléede to death in vs? I hope the beſt, and I wiſh the beſt, the Lorde in his mercie ſet a watch before our mouthes, and kéepe the dore of our lippes for euer hereafter. Next commeth hearing and beléeuing to be conſidered of faultes in neceſſitie alſo, if telling falſe tales hath before béene iuſtly blamed. For there is nothing that ſo nurceth and nouriſheth vp a tale teller, as doth the credulous heart, and attending willing eare

of the hearer. And therefore if the one be a vice, the other certainely is no vertue. Nowe howe guiltie are we in this againe, howe ſtayned, howe blotted before our blemiſhleſſe God, if he ſhoulde enter into iudgement with vs? For Chriſt his ſake let vs weigh it, let vs viewe it, and euen earneſtly thinke of it, and fearing to be damned, let vs feare to ſléepe ſoundly in the ſinne that

who ſo wanteth, wanteth God? Is this to loue thy neighbor as thy ſelfe? When full ſore it offendeth mee that any man ſhould credite a ſurmiſe of me, if it be not true? O eies, O heartes, where is their ſight and féeling? What loue can my neighbour beare me, or with what heart can a ſeruant ſerue me, when he ſéeth whiſperers ſtill about me, and findeth my nature ſo credulous of them, as that all his faith and trueth, all his traueile and labour, all his affection and loue were it neuer ſo ſincere and vpright, and euen flowing from the rootes of his heart and the verie bottome of his ſoule, yet is in hazarde euerie houre of vniuſt condemnation, of vnkinde regarde, and moſt vndeſerued reproofe? Truely as I haue ſaid before, it is the verie tried cutthrote of all amitie, friendſhippe, or faithfull louing ſeruice to haue a liſtening eare, and a credulous heart without maruelous good diſcretion. And I am moſt aſſured o
                     •
                   it, there is no plague nor infection gréeuous in the worlde comparable to this poyſon, in eſtranging, alienating, and

in the end quite driuing awaie from me thoſe heartes, that were mine owne with bodie and all worldly abilitie, in trueth, in honeſtie, in alleadgeance, in God, in Chriſt, and in all good meaning to the death. Who loueth for gaine, and ſerueth for hire, he is a ſlaue to the thing that he gapeth for, and to make vp his mouth he will carie any thing: but to whome loue is gaine, and due regarde of his poore true heart an abundaunt rewarde, the deniall of it diſcourageth his meaning, grindeth his ſoule in ſunder, and raketh him vp in duſt, by vntimely death. And therefore ſince it offendeth God, hurteth our brother, and verie greatly indamageth our ſelues, O that we would ſée it, conſider it, and as God by grace ſhall ſtrengthen our fraile natures ſcoule vppon the ſpéeche that practiſeth manies harme, and couenant with our heartes to knowe before wee credite: ſo would God bleſſe vs, manie report well of vs, and true hearts of neighbour, friende, ſeruant, or whoſoeuer neuer leaue vs. Paſſing then on in this examination further, wee may

not forgette the publiſhing of our brethrens priuate offences, a diſpleaſing thing vnto the Lorde, and a gréeuous breach of this commaundement. Wee ſhould couer in charitie what no bodie knoweth but wee, if the partie will be reformed, euen as willingly and readily as euer wee would our ſelues finde fauour for our infirmities. But doe we it? Is my brothers ſhame my griefe, is his credite déere vnto me as my life? Goe I backewarde with a cloke on my backe to caſt vpon his offence, loth that either others or I my ſelfe ſhould ſée it, as good Sem and Iapheth did to their bared father in his drunkenneſſe?
                     Gen. 9.23.
                   No no, wee grinne and laugh rather with curſed Cham, and blabbe it out to others. Good beloued, let vs weigh our wantes, and neuer make our vices vertues. God aſketh but our confeſſion in griefe and ſorowe, and he will heale vs. It is a branch and a breach of this commandement, and therefore no thing to be continued in. But I dwell too long in this ſpéech vnto you. Many things mo might yet be rehearſed, but ſée them your

ſelues, and let my ſilence paſſe them. Theſe fewe bewraye our want of perfect obedience to the lawe, and ſo conſequently of anie life and ſafely by the workes of the ſame. And therefore I hope we clearely perceiue that without a Sauiour wee were but loſt, make what diſtinctions we can of obedience, of iuſtification, or ſuch like. Faſt cleaueth to vs and cannot bee denied gréeuous guilt againſt both this lawe and all the former, and curſed is he which abideth not in all to doe them (ſayeth the Lorde).

Wee haue not doone all, but wee haue broken much, and therfore the concluſion lighteth vpon vs, and all the ſubtilties of all the wittes in the worlde, can not remooue it from vs, if the Lorde ſhould marke what we haue doone amiſſe, but in this one lawe of his, and iudge vs thereunto and by, we are not able to abide it, wee are caſt away. Therefore let vs flie from the lawe as faſt as euer wee can,

and take the right vſe of it thereby to be led vnto Chriſt, and let this be our firme comfort,

This is ſure, and this is comfortable to hould by, and the Lorde increaſe this faith in vs euer.

               Question.
            
            
               
                  YEt playner I pray you, if you can ſet downe the difference of this commaundement from the other, for as I haue heard, ſome haue halfe thought it ſuperfluous, ſeeing as the former did alſo forbid the inwarde thought aſwell as the outwarde act.
            
            
               Anſ. It is as plaine as may be alreadie, yet to content you thus ouer againe. The former commaundementes did forbid the act and the ſetled or conſenting thought of the heart, though the déede were not doone, as for example, the precept of killing forbiddeth the déede, and with all, once to thinke in heart to doe ſuch a déede, with a reſolution verily to accompliſh it if I can. But nowe this commaundement commeth néerer, and condemneth not onely that thought that is ſetled, and lacketh but

oportunitie to doe the déede, but euen the verie thinking alſo of any thing contrarie to the loue of God, or my neighbour, though I doe neuer conſent to it, but ſnubbe it, miſlike it, and reiect it. For euen yt hauing of an euill thought in my minde is a fruite of my corruption, ſuch as in innocencie if we had ſtood we ſhould neuer haue had, and therefore naught. So there are two degrées of thoughtes, the one with conſent to accompliſh in déede what we do thinke, if we can, and the other without conſent repulſed away when wee awake and ſée it. The former in the former commandementes was forbidden, and the later in this. A ſtrange doctrine in ſhewe no doubt to manie that thinke this their thought is frée. But we muſt not maruell, ſince euen the Apoſtle Paul himſelfe would neuer haue ſuſpected anie danger in concupiſcence, luſtes, and deſires, if the lawe had not ſayde, Thou ſhalt not luſt or deſire.
               
                  Rom. 7.7.
                Nay it appeareth verie plainely in that place (ſayth a godly man) that he thought maruelous well of himſelfe before hee came to

this commandement. He tooke himſelfe before to be liuing, and in good liking towardes God and godlineſſe, but when he had looked vpon this lawe and beheld himſelfe a while in this part of the glaſſe he ſawe himſelfe plainele to be no bodie, but a dead man ſould vnto ſinne. And therefore a thouſande times néedefull, that the Lorde ſhould adde this lawe to all the reſt, to humble vs throughly, ſéeing ſo ſingular a man was not fully caſt downe before he had wreſtled with the iuſtice of God in the ſame. Let vs therfore thinke of this thing that ſéemeth ſo litle in our eies. For wee heare what the Apoſtle ſayth, it is ſinne to deſire,
                  Rom. 7.7.
                and we may ioyne vnto it the words of the Lorde himſelfe affirming plainely, that the verie imagination of mans heart is euill euen from his youth.
                  Gen. 8.21.
                God hath made the heart aſwell as the bodie, to ſéeke his glorie, and therefore good reaſon the cogitations of the hart ſhould no more ſtraie from their true end, than the actions of the bodie. Neither may our reiection of ſuch thoughtes in the ende, and not conſenting vnto them to

accompliſh them in act, bleare our eies with an imagination, that we haue not offended in them, in going ſo farre as we went. For it is a blemiſh, a want, an impietie, and a degrée of vnchaſtitie in a woman to ſuffer the cogitation of anie forren friende beſide her huſbande to tickle her with conceite vnlawefull, though in the ende ſhe repulſe it, and abhorre to accompliſh it, and howe can it then be faultleſſe in theſe hearts of ours the ſpouſe of the Lorde to dallie with ſuch delightes, and to purſue in minde, by thinking of them, the pleaſures that ſuch conceites doe pleade before vs, though in the concluſion we giue the deniall and do not conſent. O it is a greater matter to loue the Lorde with all the heart, than that it may abide anie light licentious wandring frō the ſame for anie time. For they are oppoſed to loue the Lorde euer, and to thinke euill at anie time: to loue the Lorde with all my heart, and to thinke nowe and then of vaine follies or flat impieties with my heart. And if it be a certaine trueth as we knowe it is, which I ſaide before,

that if we had ſtoode in our innocencie firme and immoueable, we ſhould neuer haue conceiued in our time any euill thought at all, or vaine or fooliſh conceite for anie moment or point of ſpace, but ſhould euer haue béene able to haue iuſtified our thoughts before God whatſoeuer they were as agréeing with the loue of him, and our brother, then is this tickling delight, that now and then will take vs and poſſeſſe vs for a time to inioy our neighbours houſe, his wife, his child, his man, maide, or anie thing that he hath, otherwiſe than we ſhould, wicked, vile, and againſt that rule of right, wherein we were created, and whereto our regeneration dayly tendeth if we be the Lordes. And therefore let this argument conuict vs, and this conſideration euer aſſure our ſoules within, that it is vnlawefull for the childe of GOD once to conceiue an ill thought, although we neuer conſent vnto it. And conſequently let it ſtir vs vp to pray with Dauid againſt our corruption,
                  Pſalm. 51.
                that the Lorde in mercie woulde vouchſafe to make vs cleane hearts and

to renewe a right ſpirite within vs euermore. Let it be ſtill the propertie of a popiſh ſpirite to extenuate ſinne, and exalt fleſh and bloud and corruption aboue truth and right, ſaying, concupiſcence is no ſinne,
                  Iam. 1.25.
                but onely bringeth foorth ſinne after it hath conceiued. But let the childe of God ſchooled vp in the trueth of the goſpell, preſſe fleſh &amp; bloud and his corrupt nature, ſo farre as gods worde and lawe preſſeth it, and let him knowe that firſt verie concupiſcence in it ſelfe is a damnable degrée, of vice, yet not the higheſt degrée, but vpon the conception thereof followeth actual accompliſhment of wickedneſſe before, but thought in heart, an higher and further ſteppe of euill in vs, which is the meaning of Iames. For if concupiſcence were not euill, then muſt it néedes be either good or indifferent. But neither of theſe it can be, and therfore it is euill. Good it is not, for the whole 7 Chapter to the Romans denyeth it. And S. Auſten pretily againſt Iulian gathering vppon his wordes that concupiſcence remayned in thē that are regenerated though

not the guilt of it, that therefore is was good, anſwereth, Si hoc ſentirem,
               
                  Libr. 6. cap. 6.
                
               non dicerem eam malam eſſe, ſed fuiſſe. Nos autem malam eam dicimus, &amp; manere tamen in baptizatis. That is, If I had thought ſo (to wit that it was good) then would not I haue ſaide it is euill, but it was euill. But we ſay it is euill, and yet remaineth in them that haue beene baptized. And when Iulian goeth on and vrgeth his aſſertion that neuertheleſſe the guilt was taken away, yea (ſayth he) Reatus quo hominem reum facit, non quo ipſa rea est, vt homicidij reatus tollitur in aliquo, non tamen ideo bonum eſt. That is, That guilt is taken away wherewith ſhee ſtayneth man, not wherewith it is ſtayned it ſelfe in it ſelfe. As the guilt and the deſert of murther a man may bee quit of, and freed from, and yet not the wickedneſſe it ſelfe in it nature changed for that cauſe, but remaineth euill ſtill. Good therefore you ſée concupiſcence is not. And indifferent it is not. For the Apoſtle flatly giueth it an harder name, ſaying,
                  Rom. 7.21.
                
               That when he would haue doone good, hee was ſo yoked, that euill was preſent with him. If the ſpirite of God

call it euill, beware we preſume not to call it indifferent, and beware more howe we play with the pleaſure of it, and take delight to doe it. Againe what concluſion carie all thoſe exhortations to crucifie, Crucifie the olde man with all his luſts, and that percing plaint of an Apoſtles mouth, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from this bodie of death? I knowe, I knowe that in me that is in my fleſh dwelleth no good. I ſay what concluſion carie they all, but this, that concupiſcence is neither good nor indifferent but flatly euill?
            
               Que. Howe then falleth it out, that it condemneth vs not?
               
            
            
               Anſ. The Apoſtle anſwereth in the 25. verſe,
                  Rom. 7.25.
                
               I thanke God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde, and in the next Chapter, There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus, which walke not after the fleſh,
               
                  Cap. 8.1
                
               but after the ſpirite. For the lawe of the ſpirite of life which is in Chriſt Ieſus hath freed me from the law of ſinne and of death. So that we ſée it is Chriſt, in whom, and by whom, and for whom wee are not charged with the

condemnation due to concupiſcence and corruption ingrafted and growning in vs.
            
               Que. But is then all deſire and affection and all coueting vnlawefull by this commaundement?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No indéede, for God hath created affections and deſires in men as mirth, ioy, hunger, thirſt, &amp;c. and they ſhould haue béene in man though he had neuer fallen, they ſhould haue loued their children, their parentes, &amp; friends euen ſtanding and abiding in innocencie, and therefore theſe thinges are not euill. Nay the want of them maketh a monſtrous abſurditie in nature, and therefore not to be maintained. The inſtrumentes of affections, and delight, and dolor, created by the Lorde, prooue them allowed, the law of God commandeth them, and reprooueth their want, Chriſt our ſauiour vntouched by ſinne ſhewed them in great meaſure, they are ſpurres, and prickes vnto vertue in vs, and therefore allowed. Beſides numbers of other reaſons that might be alleadged.
            
               
               Que. What elſe doe you obſerue in the commandement?
               
            
            
               Anſ. I doe duely weigh the particulars that God reſtrayneth our coueting in, and I ſée them to bee ſuch as moſt commonly, and moſt without checke, men ſuffer themſelues to be caried away withall. As the houſe of my neighbour that is his inheritance, landes, and poſſeſſions, which we ſo gréedily often behoulde and marke, wiſhing and willing them far far otherwiſe than a Chriſtian heart ſhould. We can flatter our ſelfe with our offering of money for them, not remembring that ſo did Achab for Naboths vineyeard, and yet gréeuouſlie offended. Our neighbours wife or an other wiues huſbande, God knowes the ſinfull thoughtes they cauſe within vs. For coueting the child againſt parents liking, and intiſing away the ſeruant of an other againſt their good, they bee thinges wherein fewe of our heartes haue any féeling. And for their cattell, with ſuch ſinnefull eies we looke vpon them, that wee euer thinke our neighbours bullocke hath a fairer yowre,

than our owne hath, as the Poet ſpeaketh: and therfore, wiſely in the naming of theſe particulars hath the Lorde taught vs wherein commonly our thoughtes offende, and what moſt carefully we are to take héede of. Alſo I further conſider the maruelous care and ſtrict regard, that euerie Chriſtian man and woman ought to haue of their ſenſes, ſéeing all euill thoughtes are forbidden. For it is the eie and the eare, that ſendeth in ſinne in ſtore into our hearts, and neuer ſhall we haue the one reformed vnleſſe there be a ſtable couenaunt made with the other.
                  Iob. 31.1.
                The heart will conceiue wickedly if the eies fréely behoulde vanities. But checke the one and ye ſtay the other maruelouſlie. And no more quench you the fire by withdrawing the wood, than aſſuredly you ſtaie the courſe of wicked conceites, when you watch and warde well ouer your ſenſes.
            
               Que. But I pray you what ſhall wee thinke of dreames, which ſeeme to be ſinnefull and we cannot amende them?
               
            
            
               Anſ. We muſt conſider the cauſes of

them, and thereby, aſwell as we can, growe to ſome right conceit of our offending by them, and in them. The cauſes are either inwarde or outwarde, and of inwarde, either the minde it ſelfe or the bodie. For often doth the minde, the bodie ſléeping, and the ſenſes reſting, remember thoſe thinges which it waking conceiued, and either deſired or feared. Alſo the diuerſe complexion and temperature of the bodie occaſioneth diuers kindes of dreames, whereby the phyſition will gueſſe the nature of the bodie, and cauſes of diſeaſe in the ſicke. Cholericke men will dreame of fires and downefaules. Melancholicke men of monſtrous and horrible thinges. The phlegmatike of waters and dull matters. And the ſanguine of pleaſant and comfortable euentes. The outwarde cauſes are alſo diuers, as the influence of the heauens, the circumſtance of elementes, neceſſitie and want, ſome hapning chance, and ſuch like. Thus doe hungry men dreame of meat, drunken men of moyſture, and ſo foorth. Quae vigilantes cogitauimus, ea ſolent poſtea dormientibus

obuerſari (ſayth one). That is, Such thinges as waking wee earneſtly thought of, euen ſuch thinges often wee ſleeping dreame of.
            
            
               Aucupibus volucres, aurigae ſomnia currus:
            
            
               The fouler dreames, that birdes he takes,
               And carters cart his viſions makes.
            
            Therefore theſe things thus knowen and weighed, if we dreame wickedly, (to name no particulars) let euerie one conſider well what occaſion in him ſelfe he can finde of the ſame, and if his owne diſorder either in dyet, or ſpéech, or meditation, or anie way hath done it, then néedeth he none to tell him, his conſcience is a thouſande witneſſes, hee hath offended. Thus anſwered Gregorie byſhoppe of Rome, when he was writ vnto for his iudgement of this matter, and if I can find in my ſelfe none of all theſe to procure it in me, yet knowe if it be euill it is a frute of corruption, and weigh well the lawe of the Lorde in this behalfe laide downe. Plutarch ſaith,
                  Leuit. 15.
                Honeſt dreames are an argument of vertue in a man, and then me thinke in reaſon a contrarie effect ſhould bewray

a contrarie cauſe. The ſame man ſaith, Peruerſorum ſomnia ſemper turbata.
               
                  De virt. &amp; viti. Plutarch.
                
               Euill mens dremes are cōmonly troubleſome. But I referre you for more of this to others. And this onely I ſay againe, the bodie well ordred, and the minde well occupied, hardly ſhall our dreames feare vs for euill.
            
               Que. What nowe then might be the affirmatiue part of this commaundement?
               
            
            
               Anſ. If thus wee ſée all wandring wayes from vpright integritie be they but euen in thought, and that alſo in the leaſt degrée without any conſent, to be by this lawe condemned as impure, what ſhould we ſée on the contrary part to be commanded, but euen a full, perfect, and abſolute conformitie, both of minde, will, appetite, and whatſoeuer is in man to the lawe of God? That which Moſes in theſe words deſcribeth, Thou ſhalt loue the Lorde thy God with all thy heart,
               
                  Deutro. 6.5.
                
               and with all thy ſoule, and with all thy might,
               
                  Luke. 10.27.
                and our Sauiour Chriſt doth adde vnto it for plaineneſſe ſake, with all thy thought: That alſo

which S. Paule deſcribeth thus: This is the will of God euen your ſanctification,
               
                  1. Theſſ. 4.7.
                
               and that yee ſhould abſtaine from fornication, that euerie one of you ſhoulde knowe howe to poſſeſſe his veſſell in holineſſe and honour, and not in the luſt of concupiſcence, and ſo foorth. From which exact perfection looke howe farre our conſcience truely awaked doeth tell vs we are wanting, euen ſo farre accurſed ſtande we before the Lorde for not fulfilling all, if wee had not a Sauiour.
            
               Que. Is there anie puniſhment outwarde appointed to this lawe?
               
            
            
               Anſ. No, and that becauſe man can not iudge the guilt of hidden heart. But it ſuffiſeth to feare any man that feareth any thing, to conſider that the ſpiritual puniſhment allotted vnto it as to the reſt is eternall death, and endleſſe torture both of bodie and ſoule for euermore in flame of laſting fire. Onely one ſtorie, that I remember, there is recorded of ſome outwarde execution vppon an inward thought, and that is of Glaucus King of Sparta,
               
                  Herodotus.
                who for conceiuing

but a thought to retaine Mileſius his pledge committed to his kéeping, yet not dooing it, was vtterly deſtroyed both he and his, and ſo foretolde by the Oracle whereat he aſked counſell
            
               The Application.
               
                  LEt vs weigh now well what hath béene ſayd I beſéech you, and neuer ſpare to ſpeake, or feare to confeſſe, if not openly before the worlde, yet ſecretly in our heartes vnto the Lorde, what due regarde of paſſed courſe compared with this lawe ſhall make vs ſée. Though we were able (which yet neuer any could but Ieſus Chriſt) to ſtande cleare before the Lorde in all the former preceptes, either for déede or thought, yet are we neuer able to ſay wee are cleare of this. For conſider, hath there neuer thought but good crept into that heart of yours within at no time ſince the day that you were firſt able to

thinke a thought, till this preſent houre? weigh it well. And what though you haue neuer conſented to it (yet wo wo vnto vs for conſent) wee ſée neuertheleſſe by this lawe of God that we are but gone. For here is condemned the verie entrance and beeing of anie vile conceit within vs for any time, though vpon ſome better wakening, we repell it, and abhorre it, and thruſt it away without his act. And who is able to ſay he neuer thought awry in the leaſt maner or meaſure that might be? Nay what conſcience cryeth not, if it be a litle rowſed, that in verie fearefull manner &amp; meaſure we haue all herein tranſgreſſed and offended? Call out our houſes, and chambers, wherein and vnder which we haue liued, aſke the fieldes, the gardens, the walles, and hedges, where we haue often walked, ſummon the ſeates where we haue ſit, examine the pillowes whereon our heades could take no reſt, what guilt againſt our heartes in this behalfe they well can witneſſe euery one of them. Shall they not ſpeake firſt one by one, and then all

with one conſent crie in the eares of the Lord with ſhriking ſounde that houres and daies, monthes and yeares, haue we ſpent in toſſing and turning, in debating and ſcanning ſuch conceites and thoughtes, as we would not for all that we enioy were written in our forheads? Fie fie the pleaſures that we haue felt in this follie, nay in this impietie, howe haue they tickled vs within, and made vs laugh to our ſelues, rubbe our hands together, forgette our meat, not heare what was ſaide about vs, and ſuch like? Howe haue we longed to be at an ende peraduenture of ſome buſineſſe, that we haue béene about, that we might euen fully debate the matter you knowe of, and plaie with the conceite thereof to our fuller pleaſure? Can we excuſe our ſelues beloued, doe I depaint out vnknowen diſpoſitions vnto you? O I ſay againe, beſide greater impieties the follies, the toyes, the trifles, the verie babiſh fancies, that will and doe ſteale vpon vs will we, nill we, euen when wee are beſt occupied, and would not be ſolicited in ſuch ſort. All which are breaches

leſſer and greater of this lawe of our God, which requireth exact obedience and coniunction of all the motions of our mind to his good will and liking. And if we had neuer fallen, wee ſhould neuer haue felt them. Therefore to ſh
                     •
                  t vp this matter, for one whom I knowe better than I know anie of you, I confeſſe a guilt, &amp; a gréeuous guilt againſt this precept of my God, and I acknowledge damnation due, if I ſhould be reiected: but the Lorde I thanke, I feare it not, not that I haue not ſinned, but becauſe my Chriſt hath not ſinned, and He is my iuſtification, ſanctification, and redemption,

                  hee is my ſtrength and my ſtonie rocke, both againſt the curſe of this lawe and all the reſt, He is my defence and my Sauiour,
                  
                     Pſalm. 18.1.
                   
                  my God and my might, in whom I do truſt, my buckler, the horne of my health, and my refuge. And to him in the true ſenſe of my weakeneſſe, and with the knéees of my heart bowed downe to the duſt I ſay for my caſe as Dauid ſayd for his, Turne away my heart O Lorde, that it may neuer féede vppon the follies of vaine

conceites, or gréeue the ſwéete ſpirite, that I ſometimes féele by vngodly wandring from his ſugred motions. Yea ſet a watch before my ſoule moſt gracious father, and kéepe the doore of my ſtrengthleſſe heart, that I may leſſe offend and more obey in this behalfe than euer I haue doone héeretofore. And now paſſe wee on to particulars mentioned to our handes by the Lorde himſelfe in this his lawe. O my beloued, how often haue we coueted our neighbours houſe, that is his earthly poſſeſſion and inheritance, if not in whole yet in part? How often haue wee toſſed our heades from the one ende of the pillowe to the other, not able to ſléepe, for thinking howe to compaſſe that péece and this péece, not weighing howe well he might ſpare it, but howe well it would fitte vs? Yea this houſe muſt be had, and that garden, and the other cloſe to the wringing out of teares from the man, the wife, and al their poore children that part from it, to the gréeuing of their heartes, and the verie vtter vndooing of them all. We ſtoppe not our eies that they gaze no

further vppon our neighbours helpes than a Chriſtian ſoule may warrant. We ſhut not our eares, neither take regarde of the ſinne that may inſue, when we are whiſpered in the eare, that this thing is fitte for vs, and that thing, and thus and thus may be had. No alas we account them the beſt members about vs, whoſe godleſſe counſell ſhall worke our endleſſe woe. Whereas a Chriſtian aſſoone as hee heareth ſuch a motion, ſhould by and by thinke in himſelfe, O Lord thou haſt delt mercifully with me euer, let not me now deale vnmercifully with any, thou haſt made me a maiſter of much, this mā a maiſter but of a litle. O Lorde let not my much eate him out of his litle vngodlily, let not my power oppreſſe his weakeneſſe and ſo foorth, and then talke with the informer, be it either a man, or mine owne gréedie eie, that hath ſpied it, and ſée whether what I may get, I may well gette, and well take into my hands, ſo as I may not be ſtinged for it an other day before my God, nor exclamed vppon iuſtly in the worlde. This doeth your owne conſcience

tell you, you ſhould doe, and the other you ſhould not doe, yet the other haue you doone, and this haue you not doone, and are you not guiltie? Good beloued goe with me in this tryall of our ſelues, and let vs ſée ſinne to be ſinne. The looking eie, and the luſting heart further after our neighbours wife, than they ſhould, would God they accuſed vs not. What ſhould I ſay of his ſeruant, man or maide? You knowe it aſwell as my ſelfe, there is almoſt no conſcience any where ſhewed in this behalfe no feare of God, no loue of man, but onely of our ſelues. For if wee like an other mans ſeruant, for any qualitie that we deſire to be ſerued with all, what intiſementes, what allurementes dare wee vſe to drawe him to vs? What offers make we, what practiſes deuiſe we, till we haue them? Yet (ſayth this lawe) Thou ſhalt not couet thy neighbours ſeruant, man, or maide, And that is as nowe we knowe, not once thinke of it, although I conſent not to it. The like is ſaide of his oxe, his aſſe, or any thing that is his. And yet wee ſée the worlde,

euer in our eye, 
                     Ʋicinum pecus grandius vber habet: Our neighbours kowe doeth giue more milke than ours.
                   His horſe we muſt haue there is no remedie, his hawke, his hounde, his pleaſure or profitte muſt be ours, and that which is worſe often without any conſideration any way, either by fauour or value, yea it muſt be giuen out, that we couet our neighbours goods, and wee our ſelues haue twentie pretie indirect and figuratiue kindes of begging, and if wee either are not vnderſtoode, or will not be vnderſtoode by him that hath it, becauſe he is loth to looſe it, then wee frette and are offended highly, and as our calling, might and power is, we ſitte vppon his ſkirtes. Thus ſinne we may déere beloued againſt this lawe of GOD, and yet we ſée it not. Nowe would God haue vs to open our eyes, to incline our eares, and to forgette this olde fathers houſe of our corruption. Nowe would the Lorde haue vs reconciled to him by repentaunce, and offende no more. And therefore I crie vnto you in the name of the

Lorde, and to this ſoule within mee, Thou ſhalt not couet. If we will heare his voice, and yet harden our heartes, if we will not reſtraine our ſenſes, the common carriers of conceites into vs, if wee will not euen euerie way wee can héereafter ſéeke to let and leſſen our diſobedience in this thing againſt the Lorde, the day of our viſitation is paſt, and our deſtruction is at hande. The lyon is come vp from his denne,

                  and the deſtroyer of the Gentilles is departed and gone foorth from his place to laie our lande waſte, and our cities ſhall be deſtroyed without an inhabitant. Yea ſo néere is our deſolation aſſuredly my beloued, that euen as it were preſently my ſoule heareth the ſounde of the trumpette, and the alarome of the battaill. Deſtruction vpon deſtruction is cryed euen at our doores, if we could heare it, and ſodenly ſhall our tentes be deſtroyed, and our curtaines in a moment. But I hope what I wiſh, and I wiſh what ſhall be our ſure ſafetie, if we will be perſwaded, euen that we would now ſée howe

farre wee are from abilitie to fulfill theſe 10 commandementes of our God, either all, or any one of them, deuiſe what diſtinction we can, horrible ſinners and tranſgreſſers we are and ſo we ſhall be founde: and therefore that wee would acknowledge it, lament it, flie to the propitiation apointed of our gracious God for our ſinnes, and onely cleaue to him, onely truſt in him, and claſpe him in our armes, ſo as all the worlde, nor the power of hell can looſe our houlde, carie him ſo to his father, and there offer him to him for all our miſdéedes as the ſaluation which hee hath prepared before the face of all people, and in whom hee is perfectly pleaſed. This wiſh I, this begge I, this craue I with all the bowelles of my affection, my fleſh ſhaking, mine eies watering, my ſoule groning, and all the ſtringes of my heart inlarged, as you feare God, as you loue your ſelues, as my calling is regarded, as my affection eſtéemed, or as hell trēbled at, yt Ieſus Chriſt may be our onely hould, and our owne obedience no hould, &amp; yet performed

as a fruite of faith daily more and more, but not with hope of ſafetie by the fame, either in part or in whole: and this O my good God graunt vnto vs, as thy mercie is vnmeaſurable, &amp; thy goodneſſe and louing kindnes vnſearchable: what paſſed is good Lord forgiue, and make vs better euer liue. Amen Amen.
