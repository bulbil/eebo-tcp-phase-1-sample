            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            THis worke is deuided into three partes, the first whereof is entituled,
            
               The view of worldly Vanities.
               Exhorting vs to contempne, all pompes, pleasures, delightes, and vanities, of this lyfe. And the second parte is named,
               The shame of sinne.
               Displaying and laying open the huge greatnesse and enormities of the same, by sundrye good examples &amp; comparisons. And the third parte is called.
               The Needels Eye.
               VVherein wee are taught the right rules of a true Christian life, and the straight passage vnto euerlasting felicitie.
            
            Heerevnto is added a priuate Letter, the which doth teach remedies against the bitternesse of Death.

               RIght noble &amp; my singuler good lord: if I shuld presume (in this epistle dedicatorie) to blasonne and set forth eyther your iust desertes in generalitie, or your exceeding fauour and bountie towardes me in perticularitie, I might both offend your honorable eares (which are seldome seene willing to harken vnto your owne prayses) and much dygresse from myne owne former course in writing, since I haue hetherto (in all my lyfe) attayned small skill or grace in the arte of adulation. Let it then please your honor to rest throughly satisfied with this my simple acknowledging of your great goodnes, so much surpassing my smal deserts, that I fynde none other meane of discharge but onely to cōtinue your faithful seruaunt and follower. The which I protest to accomplish vnto my lyues end, as well towards your own person &amp; my good Ladie, as to all your posteritie in euerie duetifull respecte. And (my good Lorde) I must needes confesse both vnto your honour and to the whole world, that amōgest a number of imperfectiōs I finde my self giltie of much time mispent, &amp; of greater curiositie thē was conuenient, in penning and endightyng sundrie toyes and trifles. So that lookyng backe (with inward griefe) towardes the beginning of my recklesse race. I fynde that both the tyme, and my duetie doe challenge in me the fruites of repentaunce. To be shewed in some seryous trauayle which might both perticulerly beare witnesse of my reformation, and generally become profitable vnto others. VVherevnto I was (now almost twelue moneths past) pricked and much moued, by the graue and discreete wordes of one right worshipfull and mine approued friend, who (in my presence) hearing my thryftlesse booke of Poesyes vndeseruedly

commended, dyd say: That he lyked the smell of those Poesies pretely well, but he would lyke the Gardyner much better if he would employe his spade in no worse ground, then eyther Deuinitie or morall Philosophie. Vnto which wordes I thought not meete to reply much at that tyme, hauyng learned that a rashe answere should not bee giuen vnto a graue aduyse. But finding my selfe therewith throughly tickl

For more perticuler proofe wherof let it please my good. Lorde to vnderstand, that I haue deuided this worke into three partes. VVhereof the first I haue named The viewe of worldly vanities. Bicause it doth very eloquently (and pythily) persuade all men to contempne the pompes, excessiue pleasures, and delightes of this lyfe. A treatise which though at the first it seeme very hard and vnpleasaunt, yet whosoeuer wyll vouchsafe the dyligent reading thereof shall reape thereout no lesse commoditie then a body repleate with hewmours receyueth by the medicinable purgacion. The seconde parte I haue termed the Shame of s

                  e. Bicause in deede it displayeth and blasoneth the detestable enormities thereof, and helpeth to cure the sowle by remembraunce and consideracion of the very lothesoomnesse, which sinne doth continually carry in it selfe. This part needeth not so much demonstracion, as it deserueth commendacion. And whosoeuer doth most beasty wallow and delight in sinne &amp; wickednesse, if he bestow but one howre in a daye to reade &amp; record the lessonnes therein conteyned, I doubt not but he shall reape much profit, and I some thankes for my trauayle.

the meanes how to auoyde the crooked by pathes which leade vnto destruction. So that the offences ones auoyded, and the mynde fully bent to goe forthwardes in godlynesse, it shalbe hard to withdraw vs from performance of our possible duties. Vnto these three parts thus collected &amp; ordred, I haue thought good to adde an olde letter which teacheth Remedies against the bitternes of Death. Being perticulerly and yet (in myne opinion)

All which to gether drawing to a reasonable vollume, I haue now finished and publyshed in print. And aswell bicause I thought the light of the aucthors ouer bright a Candle to be hydden vnder a busshell, as also for that I would make the worlde wytnesse how deepe my graue freendes aduise dyd sinke into my memorye, but especially to leaue some pawne of thankfulnesse in your honorable handes, vntyll I may with greater deserte dyscharge some parte of such infinite dewties as I owe vnto your Lordshippe: I presume ryght humbly to dedicate my trauayle herein vnto your patronage &amp; noble name. Euen so beseching the same to pardone myne imperfections, if any (through ignoraunce and not for lacke of zeale) haue passed my penne throughout this worke. And much the rather for that in deede I haue bothe vsed the conference, and abyd the correction of learned Deuines, to make it the more worthy of so honorable a patrone. How so euer it be, my wyll and desire are very earnest to please and profyt all true christians in generallitie, and to purchase the continuance of your comfortable fauour in perticularitie.

Tarrase of the Kinges pallace after noone, and beheld Bersabée washing hir ouer against him, he sent for hir, and had hir, and lay with hir, for she was an exceding faire woman. Likewise, he which hath a wyfe, is carefull for worldly ryches,1. Cor. 7. and is troubled. For he is vexed and tossed, by many

cares, &amp; is deuyded and torne in péeces with sundry doubts, that he may get and administer thinges necessary for his wyfe, his children, his seruantes, and his handmaydes: So that the tribulacious of the flesh haue such thoughtes. The wyfe doth stryue to haue precious Iewells, and change of apparrel, so that hir ornamēts are often times more worth then hir husbands substance. For otherwyse by night &amp; day she will morne, sighe, tattle, and murmure. There are thrée thinges that suffer not a man to abyde in his owne house. Smooke, Rayne, and an euil wyfe. She: sayth she (meaning by some of hir neighbors wyues) goeth better apparreled, and is better estemed of all men. But I am most miserable in all places where I come, and therefore am despised and contempned of all men. She will onely be loued &amp; lawded. Affirming the loue of an other to be the hatred of hir: And the prayse of another, she suspecteth to be hir disprayse. You must loue all that she loueth, and hate all that she hatethe. She will haue the vpper hand and ouercome, but she cannot abyde to be ouercomen. She will not be maystred, but she aspyreth to mayster. She wold haue power to doe all thinges and would want nothing.
            If she be fayre, she will easily be loued. If she be foule, then is she not easily liked. But it is hardly kept which of many is desyred. And it is greuous to possesse that which no man will vouchsafe to haue. One soliciteth the fayre with liberall gifts and rewards, an other wooeth her by brauerie. Another by witt and pollicie, a nother with merry conceyts, and one way or other she is caught, which is so on all sides beseadged. An Asse, an Horse, ā bedd, a garment, a cuppe &amp; a glasse, are prouid first and then bought. But the wyfe is scarcely séene so soone, but that she doth some wayes offend before she be maryed. And yet howsoeuer it happen, they must be had. Whether she be foule, filthie, sicke, folish, proude, wilfull, or what fault soeuer she haue, (but onely for fornication) a wiefe maye not be put away from her husband.

wordes and curses to haue killed hir. But when as no man either of pittie or of furious fiercenesse would dispatch hir, and yet as fast as she sought, for any thinge to comfort hir, there came others which sought as fast to take it from hir, and hir plentie began now to fayle hir. Honger which stooke in hir bowells, and the marrowe of hir bones (beinge dryuen into fury, by pinching of néede and famyne) did driue most wicked councell into hir mynde, and armed hir against the very enstinct of nature. For she had a young childe sucking at hir pappes, whom beholding, she sayde: O sonne, thou art the vnhappie childe of a more vnhappie mother. For in warre, famyne, and spoyle, of wicked robbers and theues, for whome shall I reserue thée: since although thou mightest hope for lyfe, yet shouldest thou be yoked in the bondage of the Romaynes. Wherefore come: O my childe, and become foode for thy mother, fury and rage for these spoylers and tyrants, and an history vnto the posteritie, of such crueltie, as else onely should haue lacked in the ouerthrow of the Iewes. This sayed, she killed hir childe immediately, &amp; layd it to the fyer, and rosted it, whereof she eate part, and part she reserued. But beholde, straight waies the sedicious spoilers rushed in, hauing smelt the smooke of the rosted meate, and threatned hir with death, vnlesse she would bring foorth the meate which they smelt, and she sayde, I haue reserued euen the best part for you, fetching out the rest of the childes members which she had set vp in store. But immediately, an horrible dread inuaded them, to beholde it, and their tongues stooke fast in their mouthes (as it were) with the soodaine consideracion of hir hard hart. Then shée with a terrible countenance, becomming more terryble and fierce then the spoylers earst were, sayde vnto them: This is my sonne, my burden, and my déede, eate you now of it, for I haue first eate of him, which I bare in my body. Be neither more pittiful then a mother, nor more tender harted then a woman. But if pittie ouercome you, and you detest the meat which I haue prepared for you, and which I haue tasted before

you, behold I will eate thereof againe in your presence. Herewith they being abashed and trembling, departed, and left vnto the miserable mother, this onely dishe, of all that she had left in Hierusalem.

And rysing betimes in ye morning, he stoode at the entry of the gate, &amp; all men which had businesse to come vnto the kinges iudgement, he called vnto him, &amp; sayd. Of what citie or coūtry art thou? who answered, I am thy seruant of such a trybe in Israell. And Absolon sayde, thy request séemeth to me to be good and iust, but here is no man to geue eare vnto thée being appoynted of the kinge, and he sayde more ouer, who wyll make and constitute, me Iudge ouer the lande, that all they which haue busines to doo may come vnto me, as vnto a iust Iudge? Yea when any man came vnto him and saluted him, he reached him his hand and imbracing him kissed his chéeke, and thus he dyd vntyll all Israell which came vnto iudgement to be hard of the king. And he dyd labour for the harts of the men of Israell. And when Absolon was gon into Ebron, he sent spyes into euery trybe of Israel, saying, as soone as you shal heare the sounde of the Trampet, say you Absolon reigneth in Ebron, and a great conspyracie was made thereby, &amp; the people cōming togeather dyd increase greatly with Absolō.

That saying of the Poet is true: Great thinges are forbydden to stande longe. They are raysed vp an high, that they may fall the more greuously. But that saying of the Prophet is more true.

Before his dayes be fulfilled, he perisheth, let him reioyce as a vyne when it first florisheth. And let his clusters be as the ollyfe, when it buddeth. Marke the saying of the wyse therevpon.

                béen troubled in my mynde to behold him, and whilest I considered him I was perplexed with feare. The more diligently and clearly that a man doeth weigh &amp; ponder ye rigor of the diuine iustice, togither wt the trespasses of his own cōuersatiō, so much the more feareful hee shal be on all sides, since he is not ignorant how terrible it is to fal into ye hād of god, which speaking by Moyses saith: There is no man ye canHebr. 20. take out of my hande or power. Wherevpon it foloweth,Deut. 32. that no man can alter his determinatiō. For so much aslob. 23. whatsoeuer he determined in him selfe, &amp; decréed to be done frō the beginning, yt no man can let or hinder. Euen as God him self being holy &amp; glorious doeth testifie by the Prophet.Esa. 46. My purpose shall stand, &amp; all my will shall be fulfilled. AndHier. 49. againe: who is lyke vnto mee? or who is able to susteineIob. 36. mée? and what is he yt may resist my countenance? behold God is great, God is high in his mightie strength, and none of the lawe giuers is lyke vnto him, who may search out narowly his wayes? or who can say vnto him: Thou haste done iniquitie? Here vpon also God is called inflexible or immoueable. Not for that he can not be pleased or appeased, or for that by his prouidence he setteth necessitie vpon things. But bicause his foresights and ordinances are vnuariable, infallible, and most certayne. Neyther is there any thing (comparing it to the eternall and prouident regard of the diuyne vnderstandyng) that can be thought casuall, or that changeth by happe. Wherefore the more sharpely that we behold the incomprehensible and vnseareheable depth of the diuine iudgements, &amp; the vnspeakeable frailtie &amp; defects of our own nature, togither wt the greatnes of our saluatiō: So much ye more hūble &amp; wary we shal haue iust cause to be,

and so much the more fearefully &amp; héedefully we shal walke before the maiestie of the highest God. For behold, we are set in the middest of the whole world. That is to say on this earth, betwéene the heauenly kingdome, and the confused hellish Chaos.
            Certeynly knowe that at the length we shall be led eyther to the eternall felicitie of heauen, or els to the perpetuall tormentes of hell. Oh that the tongue of our hartes would tast this selfe same morsell as it deserueth to be tasted. For then I thinke we should neuer loosely be giuen ouer vnto vayne pleasure and delights, we should not spend our tyme laughing, sporting, or playing, but in wéeping and repentance. So as we might truly confesse with Iob: ThatIob. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . we haue alwayes feared God as the swelling waues which would ouer whelme vs. Being induced there vnto by the déepe contemplation of the Psalmist saying: Come and beholdPsal. 65. the works of God which is terrible in his degrées vpon the sonnes of men. And Paule sayth: O profound depthRom. 11. of the treasure of Gods knowledge and wisedome, howe incomprehensible are his iudgementes? and how vnsearchable are his wayes? he is the Lord that almightie King, in whose power and dominion all thinges are constituted. Who only is péerelesse. So that his being doeth infinitely excell the being of any thing that is created, as that (in respect thereof) all other things séeme (as it were) to haue no being at all. Furthermore, since we are beset in so greate daunger, what remayneth for vs to doe, or what remedye is profered vnto vs, but euen that we eschue and auoyde with a most vigilant mynde those thinges whereby God (so dreadfull) is offended, and whereby such paynes of infinite damnation are procured? (which are sinnes) euen as the scripture doeth admonishe vs saying. Flye from sinne as from the sight of a Serpent. For none aduersitie shall béeEccle. 27. hurtfull vnto thée, if none iniquitie get the ouer hande ofGregor. thée. Wherefore a yong man of singular capacitie, and my dearest (of all deare) brother, to the ende that we may more

warely hereafter eschue and auoyde sinne. I intende fyrst (by Gods helpe) to wright for the stirring vp and inflaming of our soule. Of the enormities, great mischiefes and hurtes that come by sin. That the vylenesse and filthinesse of sinne beyng perfectly vnderstoode and perceyued, you may at the length flye from vyce with so great dilligence that you may as well deserue to be preuented and adorned by your creator with giftes of grace, as you are already by him adorned and preuented with giftes of nature.
            
               
                  That only sinne causeth a reasonable creature to be displeasaunt, dispisable and odious vnto God.
               
               The first acte.
               
                  EEuen as there is nothing more to be desired than to please God, and to be (of him) beloued, estéemed, or honoured: So is there nothing worse, more detestable or more terrible, than to displease him, and to be (of him) dispised and hated. In lyke maner, as vertues and the actions of the same, doe make vs pleasing, honorable, and welbeloued vnto the true God: So vicious qualities and sinnes, do make vs vnto God displeasing, contemptuous and hatefull. For he the almightie creator of the vniuersall world, although he loue all things as touching that they haue of him, that is to say, as touching their being which he doth vncefsantly conserue in his kynd: according to the saying of the wise man: Thou louest (O Lord) all things

That is to say, as touching iniquitie &amp; their transgressions as the scripture sayth: The wicked and his wickednesse are hatefull vnto God. And agayne, thou hasteSap. 14.

                     . a stray from thy righteousnesse, since their thoughtes were wicked. And agayne, he that dwelleth in the heauens shall laugh at them, and the Lorde shall laugh them to skorne. Then shall he speake vnto them in his wrath, and in hys furie shall he vexe and trouble them: yea euen this thyng happeneth by the most iust iudgement of God. That they which contempne and dishonour God, which is aboue all things to be exalted, and to be thought worthiest of all worthies, preferring their owne will before his diuyne pleasure: should be dispised and ouerthrowne, by him as he him selfe protesteth saying: whosoeuer glorifieth mée, I will glorifie him. But they which dispise me, shall be vnable. Such are all the wicked and peruerse, which haue no care to heare the word of God, or doe omit the fulfilling therof, when they haue heard it. Of whom the euerlasting &amp; vncreated wisedome sayeth: bicause I haue called, a

And yet neuer marking how horrible the eternall God and most high Iudge doeth threaten and affirme that he will skorne and laugh at suche men at the tyme of their death. Fynally, as IobIob. 22. sayeth: The wicked are preserued vntil the day of distruction, and they shall be ledde vnto the day of reuenge, and shall drinke of the furie of the almightie.

And therefore it maketh the mynde created to become odious displeasing, and dispysed vnto God, yea so muche the more as it hath bene polluted with sinne.

Further in the holy scriptures are rehersed punishments to be executed vpon the wicked, and ioyes prepared for the iust. That as well by the terror of punishment, as by the loue of those ioyes we might be induced to eschue and hate sinne. Also there are set down two (as it were) entyer parts of rightuousnesse. That is to say, departure from sin, &amp; actualPsalm. 36▪

Where vnto we are boūden at all tyme. And therefore since by the negatiue kynde of preceptes we are commaunded to auoyde sinne (and yet we can not vniuersally and continually auoyde sinne, vnlesse we also in due tyme doe well according as we are commaunded by the affirmatiue precepts) therfore in the preceptes of auoyding and eschuing sinnes, the precept of well doing is also included. Unto which two pointes the whole doctrine of the holy scriptures doe tende. And yet to speake absolutely, the blessed vision of God in the heauenly habitation is the full ende of eschuing of sin and of doing wel.

                  That the greatnesse and enormitie of sinne is comprehended (by generall speech) in sixe poyntes.
               
               Actes. 3.
               
                  IT is easie to be séene by sixe especial notes,
                  Especially if it be that which some call mortal sinne. how huge, howe detestable, how filthie and vyle sinne is. First (and chiefely) on Gods behalf, who by sinne is dishonoured and offended. For howe much the higher his maiestie is, and howe much the greater is his holinesse, so much greater enormitie it is to sinne agay

Then since God is eternall and onely to be honoured, of a wonderful great maiestie, and an infinite holinesse, equitie and perfection, therefore all sinne which is committed against him and his commaundementes doeth carry with it (by a certayne kynde of meane) an infinite gréeuousnesse and enormitie, wherevpon our Lord speaketh vnto the wicked saying, Woe be vnto them bicause they haue gone from mée. They shall bée distroyed bicause they haue vsed collusion agaynst mée.

                   all health, and the originall cause of all nobilitie and pleasaunt swéetenesse, it is certayne that a mynde created (being once alyenated from him) is dispoyled of the true blessednesse, depryued of the lyuely and frée nobilitie, and left naked from all sincere swéetenesse. And therefore vecommeth ignoble, miserable, bitter, and vnpleasaunt, and in verie deed most wretched and poore, as one that is destitute of all abundance of the spirituall graces. Herevpon is said to the impenitent sinner: doest thou not know that thou art a miserable wretch, poore, blynd, and naked?
               Secondarily, sinne is noted by the qualitie of the sinner. Sinnes are made so much the huger and greater, the more that he is bound vnto equitie, and the more or greater benifittes that he hath receyued of God, yea the more learned or able that he was to haue done wel.
               Thirdly it is weighed and noted in the qualitie of the  matter whereaboutes the sinne is committed agaynst a mans person then agaynst his substance. But those sinnes are moste gréeuous which are directly committed agaynst God. As blasphemy, infidelitie, or desperation.
               Fourthly, by meanes of the end which the sinner tendeth  too, for the worse that the sinner his intent is, the more greuous is the sinne.
               Fiftly, by the circumstances, that is to say, of the tyn

               Sixtly, of the verie deformitie of the sinne it self, according  to it self, &amp; by reason of it selfe. The which is alwayes so much the greater, and more loathsome, as the vertue is the gallanter and more worthie which is contrarie vnto it. Whervpon as the loue of God is the highest vertue, so to 
                     •…
                  ate God is the greatest sinne. So that on all sides and in all respectes the vylenesse, filthinesse, and enormitic of sin is multiplyed and increased. And therefore holy Gregorie sayeth: if we knewe in what maner our soule is wounded and doth fester by euery least sin or faulte, we would surely (vnto death) resist sin. And again, a stinking dog is more

tollerable (sayeth hée) vnto mans smell, than a sinfull soule vnto God▪ Go to then (my dearly beloued) if we feare or be vnwilling to be, &amp; to appeare, vyle, filthie, detestable, &amp; ignoble before the holy and moste worthie maiestie of God, If we abhorre that the countenaunce of our creator should bée turned from vs, let vs then auoyde sinne with all carefulnesse and pure affection. Forasmuch as no deformitie, no hurt, no blot, can so much defyle, infect, or disorder mans bodie, and make it séeme so detestable and disfigured in mens eyes, as the reasonable soule is with euerie mortall sinne blemished, made vyle, infected, and made filthie and detestable before the sight of the diuyne maiestie and of his holie Angels.

               That other is (as it were) materiall. That is the conuersion of the mynde created variable and readie to fall vnto the stedfast consideration of the high goodnesse. Herevpon two euil thinges there are also coriespondent vnto sinne. For as touching the formall poynt, the payne of the losse or damage is coriespondent vnto it: which is extreame miserie and lacke of the heauenly fruition. But as touching the materiall poynte of sinne, the payne of the sences doeth therevnto corresponde. That is to say, the sencible paynes of hell which are the punishmentes of eternall fyre.

And all this is subuerted by sinne: for by it the mynde created, rebelleth agaynst his creator. And doeth (as it were) turne his backe against his creators fact: neyther doeth it indeuour it selfe according to his counsell, but trusteth in his owne strength. Furthermore, it is sinne to preferre a mans wil before the wil of God, and not to brydle and restrayne a mans owne libertie according to the terrour of the diuyne lawe.
               Wherevpon in all sinne, the sinner doeth propounde vnto him selfe an ende in some frayle and created goodnesse: vnto the which he is inordinately affected, and doeth viciouslye cleaue vnto it: yea more than vnto God, bycause it is agaynst hys will and ordynaunce.

                  DIonisius doeth teach in the fourth Chapiter of diuine titles or names. God his nature is goodnesse (doubtlesse) pure, perfect, and infinite. And furthermore the nature of the first being can not in him be diminished, as Thomas doth eloquently bring in, in cōclusion agaynst▪ the Gentyles. And therefore whatsoeuer perteyneth to the fulnesse worthinesse most chiefely to be wished after, desired, or the excelencie of goodnesse, the same agréeth vnto the diuine or vncreated bountie or vertue, with singular perfection and more than most excelent excelencie. Wherevpon it foloweth that the eternall and most delightfull God is the chiefe, moste excelent, and incomparable God. In whom is the most incomprehensible and vnsearchable fulnesse not able to be discribed. All good, all faire, and all desireable goodnesse, in comparison of whose goodnesse, a

But as I haue sayde in sinne, this created goodnesse which is chaungeable, dependyng of another, and néedie, is preferred before the diuyne vnmeasurable goodnesse, which dependeth on nothing, and is simply perf

Therefore in this respect the enormitie of sinne is great surely and almost vnspeakeable, and the sinner him selfe doeth offer an inexplicable dishonour and iniurie to the most good, most amyable, and most desirerable God. Whose goodnesse in the meane whyle he setteth light, dispiseth and abiecteth to the ende he may preferre before it most vayne, earthly, frayle, and worldly good things.

If thou couet delightes and pleasure, all delight and pleasure are in his right hand vntill the latter day. If thou wish for eyther honour, prayse, or glorie, he doeth glorifie those which glorifie him, for euer. To conclude, he loueth those that loue him, he heareth those that feare hym, and he saueth them that hope in him. Briefely sinne is altogither repugnant vnto diuyne charitie, and doeth take away the feruent heate and perfection thereof. Therefore least the word of God should be diminished or waxe colde towardes vs: Let vs (as much as we may) eschue, be waile, and amend our sinnes, to the ende that so we may be made the more feruent dayly in the holy loue of the heauenly deuinitie. But euen as by the premisses we see that sinne is committed by cleauing more vnto the creature, than vnto the Creator. So doe we incurre and light into sinne by inordinate affection vnto the thinges created, yea although they be about God, or pertayning vnto him.

And how much greater punishment (sayth he) doe you thinke that they deserue which spurue against the Sonne of God, and holdeth the bloode of his testement to be defiled, and cōmitteth dispightfulnesse against the spirite of grace: Furthermore after his holy supper, Christ (beinge nowe néere vnto his Passion) euen in the same night that he was betrayed sayed emongest other things vnto his Appostles.

And since dissimilitude is the cause of displeasure, hatred and turning away, sinne dothe deserue the eternall and infinite displeasure which is a turnige awaye, and a hatred to God, whiche deserueth eternall dampnation.

                  FUrthermore, the more liberally and abundantly that any man doth preuent an other in loue, so much the more decent and iust it is to loue him againe hartely. And the more frowarde and peruerse it is also to doo any lesse then to loue him. But it is most vngratefull and vntoward, euen to hate him, abiect him, and dispise him, and altogether to tourne away from him: especially if the beloued be suer that he is so beloued of the louer.

Furthermore also because vnion is the proper effect of loue, and consequently therewithall mutuall societie and perticipacion. For loue dothe knyt the louer to the beloued, and maketh all good thinges that the louer hath to become vnto the beloued. If therefore we desyer rightly and worthely to know how and in what maner our God hath loued vs, let vs behold in what maner he hath conioyned himselfe to vs and to our nature. For beholde, dyd not the onely begotten sonne of God himselfe by the will of God the Father, and the cooperacion of the holy ghost, vnyte our nature vnto his diuinitie, by a substanci a, immediate, high, &amp; inward kinde of vnione? yea by so great an vnione as none could be more greater or more worthie? And therefore since he conioyned himselfe vnto our nature so highly, and so in wardly, it is apparaunt also how highly he dyd loue vs before hand, especially since he vouchsafed &amp; deigned so long to be conuersant we vs in the nature which he dyd so assume and take vpon him, yea euen the eternall Father himselfe dyd so loue vs that he gaue his onely béegotten Sonne as the Euangelist John dothe saye: Who exhorteth vs againe in his first epistle saying:

                  earely beloued let vs loue god, for he first loued vs. Furthermore he ioyned our myndes incessātly vnto him and by supernaturall gifts, as by grace, doeing ye which is acceptable, and by actual motion of the holy ghost. By faith, hope, charity, &amp; the other vertues powred vpō vs &amp; by their acts. Yea further, our god is ready to cōmunicat al yt he hath (yea himself also) vnto vs.

For there is no eye that hath séene, nor eare that hath hard,Esa64. neither is mans hart able to cōprehend what God hath prepared for his elect. For he hath prepared himself as a reward for them. Since he created vs to enioy the most swéete fruicion and happy vision of holinesse. And this is the most lyberal loue of god that geuing vs his gyfts, he geueth (euen with the same giftes) himselfe vnto vs. That we may truely, eternally, and happely behold, haue, possesse, &amp; inioy him. Herewith he so much loued vs, that by the mouth of Salomon,Pro. 8. he sayth vnto vs: My delights are to be with the sonnes of men. Now therefore (my welbeloued) marke how peruerse, how vncomely, and how great a fault it is, not to requite with loue, this, such, and so great a louer. Yea to neglect, to offend, to fet light by, to dispose or to hate him. And he that sinneth, wylleth in all things that which God will not, and that which god wylleth that will not hée accomplishe. Therefore he dothe not truely loue God, since it is the propertie of friendes to wyll and to nyll in all thinges alyke. Yea he despiseth an

                   lyght by God, whose preceptes he regardeth not. And so he dothe altogether turne himselfe away from him, and yeldeth no turne vnto this so wonderfull, méeke, most bountifull &amp; most excellent louer. But payeth euill for good, and hate for loue. Yea he dispiseth God, who hath shewed himselfe so famyliar vnto him. Therefore let vs (my welbeloued) heartely learne to loue God sincerely and inwardly. Let vs be caryed vnto him with all feruētuesse of mynde. Let vs conforme our affectes alwayes vnto his most holy wyll. Let vs hate whatsoeuer he hateth, and let vs earnestly imbrace all goodnesse.

                   humble shuldest thou be found. Behold thou hast at gods hand ye gifts of nature, ye goods of fortune, &amp; the fruites of the church. Are not then thy sins great and gréeuous especially since they procéed not of mans infirmitie or of ignorance but are such as thou knowest to be vnlawful? And mark therfore what account thou must giue vnto God for these things. Last of all the enormitie of our sins is vehemently agreuated by the benifits which we haue receyued by Christ, I mean those which he (for our saluation) did take vpō him, &amp; suffered.

And hath (for our conuersion vnto faith and grace) done so many miracles by his holy Apostles and other elect. And all this considered the more that any man doth honour any other then him, so much the more iniquitie it is not to rehonor him agayne. But it is most leude and wicked euen to dishonor him, especially since he is most excelent both by vertue &amp; authoritie. And therefore since by the before named benifits aswell naturall as supernatural, especially by the incarnation of ye word, &amp; by the glorificatiō of his humanitie, god hath so inexplicable, honored mākind, and hath vouchsafed to cal vs which of substāce are no better thē pore litle wormes of the earth (yea and hath made vs) hys sonnes, heires, &amp; friendes: furthermore hath promised againe to carry vs vp into the most worthie Courte of the

(I mean against the sinner himself) bicause that God is the nerest obiect &amp; matter most at hand vnto some sins as vnto those that are directly cōtrarie to the diuine vertues, &amp; vnto some other the neighbor is the nerest matter, and vnto some he him selfe which sinneth. Neuerthelesse all sin is against God, which detesteth, punisheth, &amp; forbiddeth all sins. For by ye diuine lawes al sin is forbidden or diswaded. Now then it is requisite to speake somewhat of the enormitie of  sin on the behalf of the sinner, and that as touching men.
               First then the enormitie of sin may be marked by our inferioritie. For the lesse that any man is by comparisō with a master or lawgiuer, so much the more humble, &amp; so much the more in subiection he ought to be. Wherevpon the contempt séemeth to be somewhat) the more gréeuous if he become rebellious to the law giuer, or superior

For man himself doth possesse ye lowest place, in rank of matters or substances belonging to vnderstanding, may not thē yt lawgiuer the most highly exalted God, (holy vnmeasured, &amp; to bée adored) disdayne much when he séeth vs vyle litle wormes of the earth (bearing clayish vessell vpon vs, being compared to vanitie and ashes, replenished in our bodies with infinite sinnes agaynst the soule) that we doe not obey his cōmaūdements, but dishonor his maiestie, and forget his benifits, yea euery houre offending him incessātly, not harkening to his exhortations which he maketh vnto vs by his ministers, &amp; not regarding his own presēce? furthermore by this cōsideration of our leudnesse &amp; vilenesse, we ought vehemently to heape vp, aggreuate, detest, &amp; bewaile, yea &amp; to dispise, reproue, &amp; to correct both our selues and all our excesses against God, since yt we most poore, most miserable, &amp; most vyle creatures, which shal soone die, (yea rather dayly dying) haue so often &amp; so gréeuously dishonoured, offended, dispised, &amp; dayly do not cease to offend our lord, our most highly exalted, infinite, almightie, most glorious, and superessential God.

               Secondarily, the enormitie of sinne (on the b
                     •…
                  halfe of the sinner) is noted by the superioritie of him that sinneth, as by prée

                  inence &amp; preferment in authoritie. For the more that he which sinneth be preferred in principallitie, or iuditiall authoritie, the more he is bound to the more ample iustice, rightuousnesse, charitie, &amp; exēplare life. Especially since the iudge or president (according t

               Seuenthly, by the benifites giuen vnto him that sinneth. Bicause (as I haue before sayd) the more or the greater benifites that any man receyueth from aboue, so muche the greater and more enorme his sinnes bée. Wherevpon the longer &amp; more benignely yn God expecteth the conuersion of him yt sinneth, so muche ye more dāpnable his sins are made.
               Eightly, by the cōmon custome of sinning, which inducet
                     •…
                  
                   hardnesse of harte &amp; obstinancie. For as Salomon writeth: when the wicked man commeth vnto the depth of sinne, he regardeth it not.
               Ninthly, by reason of the age, for one selfe same faulte is  iudged more reproueable in old men, then in yong men.
               Tenthly by ye easinesse yt the sinner had not to haue sinned, or to haue resisted against sin. As in men of good wit and vnderstandyng, sinne is more gréeuous than in suche as are prone vnto vice. Wherevpon Augustine in his xiiij. booke de ciuitate dei speaketh saying: The first precept in Paradice was broken &amp; vyolated, so much the more vniustly, bicause

it mighte haue bene with so much the more ease obs
                     •…
                  ed and kept. For in sinners of such as be of good vnderstanding ther is more voluntarie consent, since from their inward thoughtes they are l
                     •…
                  sse enforced vnto euyll. And therefore they doe sinne more greuously then the rest that are their 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  quales, especially since they doe both abuse gods 
                     〈◊〉
                   vnhappely, and are so much the more vngratefull vnto their creator. By these thinges let euery man weigh and consider the enormytie of his sinnes. Bicause in some men all these thinges (yea, fully all these thinges, which doe aggreuate sinne) doe concurre, in some many. And in other some fewer. But vnto (thée my derely belo
                     •…
                  ed) I propound the last of all these poyntes to be most singularely considered. Least thou shouldest dampnably abuse the goodnesse of thyne excelent wit. But thou most (by a worthy indeuor) bend they selfe so much the more warely vnto all vertues: as it is easier vnto thée then vnto others, to become vertuous. The which if thou doo, thou shalt be most deuoute and most acceptable vnto God. But if thou regard not thy doings, and geue place vnto vices, surely thyne iniquitie &amp; dampnacion will be exceding greate. Whervpon Augustine in his second booke, De ciuitate dei, sayth: If there be any natural part apparant in thée which is laudable, it is no way perfect nor purged but by pyetie, (which is worshipping of God) and by impietie it will be ouerthrone and punished. Further of all that hath bene sayde the very aggreuating of sinne it selfe is to be vnderstoode by the other partes thereof.
            
            
               
                  Of the enormitie of sinne, by the obiect or matter about the which it is committed.
               
               Art. 
                     〈◊〉
                  .
               AS we haue already touched, some sinnes are sayd
                     •…
                   to be against GOD, some against the neighbour, and some against the finner himselfe. And it is certein
                     •…
                  ,

that the sinne againste God are the moste greuous generally. It is also now handled of the greu
                     •…
                  usnesse of sinne, hauing respect to God. And as those sinnes are sayde to be moste greuous, which are against GOD for his goodnesse, maiestie, holynesse, charitie, and his bestowing of benefittes. So the lyker vnto God that the neighbors be againste whome the sinne is commytted, the more greuous and enorme the sinne shalbe accounted. And therevpon the enormitie of sinne againste the neighbour, Is first marked  by the aucthoritie, dignitie, and power of him againste whome the sinne is commytted. Who, (the greater his power or aucthoritie is) so much the more greuous it is to offend him or to trespasse against him, as appeareth by treasons cōmitted against princes. Herevpon it is very enorme &amp; greuous to trespasse against a preacher or mynister: since it is chéefely againste charitie which is due vnto them, and against iustice by the which obedience and reuerence are to be geuen them. Wherefore of such God speaketh sayinge:Luke. 10 He that heareth you heareth me, and he which dispiseth you dispiseth me. Moyses also sayth to the rebellious Israelites:Exo. 16. Your murmuring is not against vs but against God. AndRom. 16. herevpon the Apostle teacheth in his epistle to the Romans: let euery liuing soule be subiect to ye higher powers. For ther is no powre but from God: and those things which are from god are ordayned. But he which resisteth authority resisteth against the ordinaunce of god. And they which doe resist him doe purchase to themselues eternall damynation.
               Secondarily, the enormytie of trespasses against ye neighbour  is perceyued by reason of the néerenesse of bloode. As thus. It is more grée

                   thyne owne sister. But it is moste gréeuous to sinne agaynst thy Parents. Since a sonne is borne of their substaunce and is (as it w

                  re) some parte of them.
               Thirdly, by the benifites which the sinner hath receyued  of his neighbour agaynst whome he trespasseth. And therefore (againe) it is to wicked a thinge to doe euill against

thy Parentes from whome the ofspring hath obteyned, being nowrishement, attendaunce, and instruction. Also agaynst maisters vnto whome honour and loue are due.

               Who, what, where, by what helpe, why, how, &amp; when.

For a man must marke who did it, by what helpe, or assistance hée dyd worke, in what place, what tyme, to what purpose, and in what manner it was done. But for asmuch as the action taketh his proper kinde by thende or purpose where vnto it tendeth, therefore worke it selfe is of the substáunce of the action. And therefore when the ende and the worke are termed circumstaunces, it is not to be vnderstode of the principall ende or action, in that that it is properly, but it is ment by some ende adioyned, and by some propertie applyed about the worke or action. Of these circumstāces this one. Is of greatest consideration. That is to saye: To what ende any thinge is done. And therefore to the more vnlawfull, or wicked, ende, or purpose, any thing be done, the fault is so much the more agreuated. And if any man pretend his worke to sundry ends or purposes whiche are forbydden, the more, and the more peruerse that these endes be, so much greater is the enormytie of his sinne. As if any man doe steale to the end and purpose that hée maye maynteyne delyghtes, banquitinge, and whoredome, yea, or to attayne thereby worldely promotion. And furthermore if any man be of the kynde of good men, if yet the ende or purpose that he preteudeth

                  e vayne and lewed, the thinge then it selfe is vnlawfull. As if any man, praye, fast, and geue, almes, to obteyne mens prayses thereby. Then for asmuch as (by the testimonie of Dyonysius goodnesse is an entyer cause, (that is to say: whyther all the circumstaunces of vertue before rehearsed, doe concurre) and the defectes or euilles doe happen by the omyttinge of any circumstaunces: Therefore the gréeuousnesse of the sinne is so much the greater, the more that the number of cir cumstaunces be which are forsaken, and the more that the partie doeth goe from the verie conuenyent circumstaunces of vertue it selfe. Herevpon let vs now not onely be sory that we doe those thinges which of their owne nature be vicyous and absolutly euill, and doe also omit things that we should doe: But also bicause we haue sinned in an iuconuenient

tyme, in a place more for bydden, to a very wicked ende and purpose, by dishonest meanes or assistaunce, and in a moste vnapt manner and fashion, euen vnfearfully and vnreuerently altogither, we must consider also how often, &amp; with what māner of person, with how great delight in sinning, and with how great, or what kynde of offence to our neighbour. For the more that the desiere of sinning (I meane the verie willingnesse to euill) be more bent thervnto, the fault is so muche the more gréeuous. Lykewise it is conuenyent and we must consider of the good thinges whiche wée doe whither they bée done in due tyme and place, with a right intent and reuerently, also. For it is more gréeuous in the time of diuine seruice on ye holy daies, and in the church, to haue a wandring mynde, to tattle, to looke gazinge about, and to set mynde, vpon vice and wickednesse. Therefore (my welbeloued) indeuour thy selfe to fulfil the good déedes wherevnto thou art bounden, with the circumstaunces before rehersed as much as in thée lieth and doe héedely consider the gréeuousnesse of thy sinnes, by all these thinges now rehersed which doe aggreuate sinne and wickednesse.

And therefore whosoeuer doth either for flatterie or for menaces or by regardinge mans fauour, yeld vnto sinne, he declareth sufficiently that he is imperfect. To conclude, the least euill of the fault, that is to say: The least sinne is more hatefull and more to be fledd from, then any kynde of euill in the payne or any kynde of punnyshment (yea, though it be infernall) as touchinge that it is méerely punishment. Therfore we ought not to sinne for the auoyding of any torment, losse, or discomodity, but rather ought a man to be willing to beare any payne then to offende God: For to offende god is as much as to léese God. (I meane the vnmesurable goodnesse of God) and to set our owne wicked wills directly against his most holy will. And therefore now (my welbeloued) consider how great is their frowardnesse &amp; how farr are they distant from true perfection, whose whole affection tendeth day and night to doe those thinges which are forbydden by thy diuyne lawes.

                  FEare is the flying from or detesting of euil. Therfore the worse that any things bée, the more to be fled from, and the more detestable they are iudged to bée. For as muche as euil is the obiect of feare: So y• it is alreadie euident that the euil of the fault is vnmeasurably to be fled frō. But the euil of the paine or the punishment of sin, or any kynde of afflictiue aduersitie, is not (in it self) absolutely euil, or simply to be fled frō or auoyded.

                  FUrthermore there are some which are withdrawne from vices with onely seruile feare. That is with the dread of punishments and not with an affection to felicitie, nor with the verie sincere loue of God. These men (as long as they continue suche) are not acceptable to God, yet such kynd of feare is not altogither vnprofitable, in as much as it withdraweth from sin. There is nothing that is done as it ought to bée, or acceptable &amp; pleasing of God, vnlesse that procéed of the charitie of God, and bée done by the loue of rightuousnesse. As Augustine in the xxj. booke De ciuitate dei: vices (sayeth hée) are ouercome by a laboursome difficultie. Neither it is possible to doe that truly or sincerely, but onely through a delight in true rightuousnesse. But they which doe séeme (by the meanes before

rehearsed) to decline from euill, and to do some good things, are euill and vnfaithfull seruants, bicause there remayneth in them an affect to sin, and a well lyking vnto things that are euil. Of such kynde of seruantes our sauior sayeth to his Apostles: I will not now call you seruantes: for the seruauntIohn. 15. knoweth not what the master doeth. And agayne:Iohn. 8. some doe eschue sinnes in hope of rewarde, and desire of euerlasting felicitie. In these men the loue of God is not perfect and altogither sincere without dissimulation, bicause they are bended backewardes towardes them selues, beholding and thinking vpon their owne commoditie, and occupie themselues most in thinking of their hyer &amp; reward. But if such d

The which who so doth, he shal not onely not be a mercenarie, but furthermore a friend: bicause he loueth God &amp; rightuousnesse aboue all things. Whereas they which are not yet perfect, are accompted to haue a beginning feare or mixed dread: bicause they withdraw themselues from si

Notwithstanding y• loue of God (in them) doeth ouer wey priuate loue, &amp; they desire the honor and glorie of God both firstly, and finally. And therefore they are in the state of health and grace. Furthermore there are others which wtdraw thēselues &amp; depart frō sins, &amp; do good, by ye onely loue of the diuine godhead, &amp; the true and sincere zeale of his honor, being conuerted feruently with their whole mynde vnto God.

Furthermore if these men do at any time think vpon their reward and desire it, that shall not procéed of inordinate backe bending towards themselues, but by a charitable relation vnto God, &amp; bicause it is gods wil &amp; pleasure that they shuld desire eternall felicitie, as men confirmed in goodnes, &amp; happely inioying God: that they should most perfectly apply their whole mynd vnto his honor, loue &amp; praises. And so the loue of the reward shal not repugne the perfection of charitie. These are the friends &amp; sonnes of God, whose minds are cōuerted into the most pure affects of diuine charitie, and the zeale of rightuousnes. And these men do in all places, &amp; at all times behaue themselues vertuously: bicause the reason of wel doing, is vniforme, pure, &amp; stable in them, euen as God him self, being the perfect loue, the zeale of verie rightuousnesse, the presence of the diuinitie, the loue of purenes, the mightie affection of diuine honor, the wel pleasing of good &amp; honest things, &amp; of all vertues. Now then (my welbeloued brother) flye from vice and exercise goodnes, rather by the most pure loue of god, ye zeale of equitie, &amp; affection to purenes, then either by feare of paynes, or respecte of rewards.

sonces, bicause in this lyfe we lacke that sence and vnderstanding of the highest and purest wisedome, by the which it might be perceiued how much wickednesse is committed in preuaricatiō &amp; dissembling with God.

                  stances are so many &amp; so great in perticularitie, that none of vs can distinctly know them all: Therfore we are not able fully to vnderstād the greuousnes of our sins. But we ought infinitly to humble our selues, &amp; hartely to call vpon the diuyne clemencie, and onely to breath too, or take comforte in the mercies of God. And to say with the true penitent sinner: myne iniquities haue ouer taken me, &amp; I had no power to sée them. And againe: our iniquities are multiplyed ouer our heads. And in another place: our sins are growne vp to heauen. Last of all: though we can not fully comprehend the hugenesse &amp; enormitie of our wickednesse. Yet by that most bitter, eternal, &amp; infernal payne which the iust God appoynteth for our sins, it appeareth doubtlesse ye they are truly so incomprehensible, great &amp; enorme: which God doth yet neuerthelesse euen in hell, mingle mercy with his iustice, in that he punisheth lesse thē we worthily deserue. And yet the enormitie of any mortall sin (howe little so euer it bée) is so great y• there is no creature in the whole world so welbeloued of God, but he would hate him &amp; dampne him (for euer) for one of these gréeuous sins, if he finde it in him finally, at his ending. Yea &amp; so great is the enormitie of sin that it maketh the sinner so displeasing vnto God as he him selfe doth not remember, any good thing which the sinner did before. As our Lord &amp; iudge did testifie by Ezechiel saying: if

Herevpon Hugo in his booke of the Arck of Noe sayeth: what temptation so euer doeth assayle a soule forsaken, and abandoned of diuyne succour, it ouerthroweth it. And Beda witnesseth: that a manne fallne into sinne,

Lorde my God. Synne doth also (according to Augustine) in an hillate and bringe to nothing. Bicause sinne it selfe is nothinge, and all men by sinning come to nothinge. By léesinge the essentiall beinge (not of nature) but of grace.
               Eyghtly, one sinne doth drawe and dispose a man vnto another. So the sinne which foloweth doth become bothe a sinne and the payne of a sinne. For of it selfe it is a sinne. And 
                     •…
                  y respect of the sinne which went before it, it is also the peyne of a sinne. Bicause the sinner by the desartes of the former sinne doth iustly deserue to be for saken of God▪ And so falleth into sundrye vices. Wherevpon according to Gregory: A sinne which is not washed away by a repē
                  taunce, doth by and by drawe one to another sinne by his owne weight, and swaye.
               Ninthly, sinne doth make such vertuous déedes which were done before to be vnfruitfull &amp; dothe exclude man frō the glorie of the heauily kingedōe. As it is written: Let y• wicked be taken away least he should sée the glorie of God.
               Tenthly, of a member of Christ, it maketh one a member  of the Deuill. For as by faith we are incorporate in Christ, so by deadly sinne, (léesing fayth, we are incorporate in the Deuill, who is the head and Prince of the vniust.

                  As it is wrytten, the wicked shall walke aboute: for they are

                   bicause their harts are not made faste vnto the highest, vnchangeable, onely true and most perfect goodnesse. Ttherefore they wander in thinges created, and are deuided in mynde, and are most vnordinately affected. Wherevpon Ieremy speaketh saying: Ierusalem hath committed synne, and therefore it is become vnstedfast. Furthermore euen as the bayte vpon the hooke doth beguile the fishe, So doth synne beguyle the synner. Bicause whiles he doth vaynely and wickedly delight therein. It bringeth him to euerlasting sorrowe. Herevpon Augustine in his. xiiii. booke De ciuitate dei doeth affirme saying. We may well say that all synne is a lye. For we doo not synne (sayth he) but of a desyer that good may come to vs. And yet of all synne euell commeth to vs. Againe, synne doeth make the synner lyke vnto a Serpent, which goeth vppon his brest, and eateth the earth.
               Euen so sinners doe cleaue fast vnto sinne, and doe striue to fill and glutt themselues therewith. Sinne doth also shewe y• the sinner is a foole. Bicause by sinning euery man doth more and more, ouercharge, gréeue, and oppresse, himselfe. He gathereth and layeth vpon his owne shoulders the sticks wherewith he kendeleth the fyer that burneth him in hell. Yea he serueth him which requyreth &amp; séeketh nothing but his eternall dampnation, and will so much the more, torment him, the greater seruice that he hath done him. Furthermore sinne doth take away true libertie. And maketh thereof most miserable bondage. Bicause (as our Sauiour witnesseth by the Euangelist) Euery man that sinneth is the seruant of sinne. Therefore Augustine in his fourth booke De ciuitate dei: Doth confesse that the goodman, although hée serue, is yet a frée man. But the wicked (sayth hée) yea, although hée reigne, is yet the seruant of as many maisters as he hath vices. And againe in the fourth booke hée saith that the will of man is then truely in fréedome, when it is not in bondage to vyce or sinnes.

And Salomō in the booke of his Prouerbes protesteth: That

                     . 4. righteousnesse doth rayse vp and enoble the people. But sinne (sayth he) doth make people miserable. For if paine make a man miserable, and ye fault much more miserable, then shall it so much the more in all respectes make him miserable, as the fault is, more detestable then the payne is. Wherevpon Augustine in the xi. booke de Trinitie sayth: To will or desiere (sayth he) that which is not decent, is a most miserable thing. And agayne sayth he, euery man is made mserable by onely euill desier. But more miserable by power thereof. For thereby the desiers of an euill thought are fulfilled. And bicause the sinner doth cleaue &amp; sticke fast vnto vayne thinges, therefore sinne dothe finally leaue him (which sinneth) vayne and voyde of all thinges.Rom. 6. As the Appostle sayth to the Romanes. What fruite had you then (that is to say in sinne when you sinned) in those thinges where at you now doe blushe. For the ende thereof is death. Furthermore sinne doth chéefely greue the sinner, at the tyme of his death. For it maketh him sorowfull for the losse of the temporall thinges (that is to say: The delightes, ritches, and honors of this worlde) which he loued. It maketh him also to feare the streight iudgement of God. The infernall punyshementes of the spéedy cōmyng of the Diuills. Who then doe cheifely indeuour to drawe y• sinner into desperation and many other euills. And then the wicked is sorowfull that he hath lost and spent his tyme so viciously &amp; vnfruitfully. Here withall after death, sinnes doe vnspeackeably gréeue the vniust. Bicause they shewe y• they are before the iust iudgement of God most worthy of euerlasting payne and confuston. And then they morne to here that terryble word: Goe you accursed into euerlasting fier. And doe vnrepayreably hold them as turned awaye from the high goodnesse &amp; fountayne of true felycitie. And lastly: As sinnes are hurtfull to them that are in sinne themselues, euen so then gréeue those which by repentaunce do
                     •…
                   with drawe themselues from sinnes.
               
                  First, bicause it neuer recouereth the glorye of the first  innocēce. As a mayde once deflowered can neuer be a virgyne againe.
               Secondarily, bicause it bryngeth vs to payne and penaltie.
               
               Thyrdly, bicause it kepeth man back from glory. For the  penytent shall not enter vntill, through Christ his merites and mercy, he be restored to the purenesse which he had in baptisme.
               Fourthly, bicause he shall neuer recouer the tyme past, &amp;  lost, ye which he might haue gayned with reward. Yea and it happeneth often tymes that the sinner being penitēt doth yet (by the dreggs and reliques of his old accustomed sinnes) become more cold in his affections, more ready to the lothesomenesse of good thinges, darker in his vnderstandinge, weaker to doe well, and much more frayle and féeble to resist the euill. And therefore Augustyne in his eleuenth booke de ciuitate dei doth say: Our mynde (sayth he) in the which reason and vnderstanding naturally haue residence, doth become vnable and weake (by certein cold and darkesome vices) not onely to cleaue to the fruicion of God but also to beare and abyde that vnchangable light. Untill suche tyme that beinge from day to day healed and renewed, it maye be made capable of such great felycitie. Whereby it is manifest how foolyshely they behaue themselues which foreslowe their conuersions and saye that after a certayne tyme they wilbe altogither conuerted yet remayninge the meane while in their vices and wickednesse. For they doe not rightly weighe into how many daungers, perrilles, &amp; hurtes, they fall in the meane tyme. And therefore sinne doth alwayes hurt many men.
               First, him which sinneth.
               
               Secondarily, the neighbours and all the church of god. Bicause in the meane while the neighbour thereby taketh offence, and the church it selfe, which is an armye to withstand the Deuill, is (by a certayne kynde of meane) thereby

also diminyshed, and weakened, by him which is wickedly conuersant and occupied.
               Thirdly, it hurteth also those that are dampned. Bicause  the more that discend into hell the greater horror, howling, and tormentes there are. For that prouerbe hath there no place whiche sayth: Solatium est misero, socium habere miseriae.
               
               Fourthly it hurteth (by a certayne meane) the blessed in  their habytations. By meane of subtraction. For the greater and more copyous that the number of the blessed is, the reward accidentall is thereby made the greater, by the happy socyety, one of them gloryinge in an others felicitie.
               And lastly, the sinner doth incurre many euills and daungers, by relapse into his olde vices. For his faultes are made the greater, and so more hardly to be forgeuen. As Ieremy witnesseth saying: Now vyle art thou made by returning
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     . 2. vnto thy wayes? For a wound hurt againe, is the hardlyer and more slowly healed. God also is made the harder to be pacified. And the Deuill the stronger to possesse, as Christ sayth in the Gospell: That then goeth the DeuillLucke. 11 and taketh vnto him seauen other sprytes worse then himselfe. And going in he dwelleth there. And the ende of that man is worse then the begynning. Also sinnne is forti
                     •…
                  ed to preuayle before the iudgement of reason. As Augustine speaking of him selfe doth say. More preuayled the encreasing euill then the vncustomed goodnesse. Lastly euen the sinner himselfe becōmeth more impotent to ryse. And thus behold (my welbeloued) how many and how vnspeable euill thinges a man doth incurre by sinning. And suerly if thou doe not amend thy liefe by reading and knowing these hurts, and daungers whiche come by sinne. If thou doe not detest and abhorre sinne, if thou doe not walke in purenesse of lyfe before God, then shalt thou bée vnexcusablely reproued of great faultes by thyne owne vertues. And shalt not doe that whiche béecōmeth the naturall goodnesse of thyne excelent wytt. For it is apparant by these things

how truly Augustine spake in his twelfe booke De ciuitate del: saying: Synne hurteth nature. And by that meanes it is contrary to nature. And yet by that vice nature is apparant to be great and lawdable. For by what meanes so euer vyce be blamed, by the same vndowtedly nature is praysed. For the right blaming of vyce, is bicause thereby a lawdable nature is dishonested.
            
            
               
                  Of the infinite mercy of God.
               
               Art. 19.
               
                  WE haue already spoken many thinges of the enormytie, filthynesse and impietie of sinne. And it is now thereby made manyfest, how vehemently the holy and most highest God, is dishonored by sinne, and how he hateth and abhorreth the same. Therefore least any man should by consideration thereof, fall into weakenesse of courage, or be broken with disperation, or faynt with ouer much sorrow, or pyne and wyther away with vndiscrete curyositie, We will say somewhat agayne of the incomprehensible and vnmeasurable mercyes of God. And therefore as the goodnesse of God is pure infinite and most plentifull, so the swéetenesse of his liberalitye, and his clemency is altogither vnspeakeable, vnlimytable, and vnexcogitable. Exceding and infinitely passinge, all our mallice, néede, and miserie. Yea, more then all the waues in the Sea passe a lyttle droppe of water, or the great heape of the whole world doth passe incomparabily the least séede that is. Let no man therefore dispare by the enormytie of vyces. For thereby hée should offer an extreme iniurye to the diuyne mercy. And should moste vehemently dishonor the vncreated verytie of the higest GOD. As though Gods goodnesse and clemency

(which hath promysed forgeuenesse and grace vnto all men how full of iniquitie so euer they be, if they doe truely repēt) were lesse then his wickednesse. To conclude is not ye mercy of the glorious God, and he which is onely to be worshipped, most infinite, who in euery moment doth perceue so many sinnes, to be done in this worlde and séeth himselfe to be dishonored, dispised, and blasphemed, so vnspeakeably of so many sinnes, and yet doth preserue them in beinge, doth vncessantly communicate vnto them, the goodes of nature, &amp; of fortune, doth nowrishe them, cloth them, &amp; prouide for thē, yea since (according to y• which hath bene said before) ye enormity of sinne is so incōprehensible, euen therin y• wonderfull greate, and infinite pytie of God, doth appere that he euer will vowchesafe, to be reconciled or to behold, or to receaue into his grace &amp; fauour, the man wt whome hée were but once offended or displeased by sinne? And beholde euen those of whome he hath béen so often times offended by such greuous sinnes, by whome he hath béen so often contempned, &amp; set behynde earthly thinges in comparison, he doth not onely vouchsafe to receue them vnto forgeuenes, grace, &amp; fauour, but often tymes he doth preuent them in vncomprehensible pyetie, and doeth happely change their hartes (by inward compunaion) vnto saluacion: taking from them all hardnes of hart. And filling them with so much grace and goodnesse, that the same doth now most abounde, where before iniquitie was most abundant. And so of most hatefull enemies, they are made most deare &amp; acceptable vnto God: therfore we must not

vnto him, doth mollyfie his hart, doth quyckly forgeue the offence which he cōmytted. And after forgeuenesse doth neuer remember the iniurie. Agayne God of his mercy doth send vs aduersities to proue our patyence withall, he geueth vs prosperytie that he may prouoke vs to loue him. And by his mercy doth bring agayne vnto himselfe those that goe astraie, &amp; doth guyde vnto him such as returne, doth rayse vp them that fall, doth staye and hold vp them that stand, and dothe leade vnto glorie all such as doe perseuer in godlynesse. Behold how greate and how verye vnspeakeable, incomprehensible, and vnmesurable, the clemencie of our God is especyally vpon his elect? And yet let no man sin the bolder by this consideration of the diuyne mercyes, presuming most foolishly vpon Gods benignitie. For he is accursed which sinneth through hope. For ye better, more méeke and clement that we know God to be, so much the more intentyuely we ought to loue him, &amp; not to dishoner or dispyse him. Wherefore betwene desperation and presumption, let vs obserue a sapientall meane, hoping with feare and fearing with hope. And so let vs contynewally be carefully and fearefully conuersant before God.

Which being delighted, ouer darkened, and bedect, with the rytches, delightes, and honors of this world doe neglect those things which pertayne to their health and saluation, doe neuer couet or desier spirituall good thinges. nor doe alwayes and enerie day perpare themselues vnto death. And therefore euen as they lyue so doe they make an end. And they doe most vnhappely dishonor God whiles they are yet sound and in health, so at the tyme of their death they are most iustly of him forsaken dispised and condempned. Is it not then more holsome, to contempne this liefe for the loue of that most happy and eternall lief which is to come? To abiect all the vanity and impietie therof and to cleaue most faythfully fast vnto that diuyne eternall and vumeasurable goodnesse
               Behold in this present and most vnstedfast lief, we must of necessitie haue regard either to eternal felycity or euerlasting  dampnation. Chuse then (my welbeloued) that which thou perceauest to be most holesome for thée. And hate, eschewe, and detest, most hartely all kynde of sinnes.
               Secondarily, the diligent consideration of death doth not  a little preuayle to make vs eschewe and avoyde sinnes, which death doth most swyftly and vncessantly approch. At which time the vicyous liefe which now delighteth vs, shall han
                     •…

                  . As to thinke what a horryble thing it shalbe strayghtwaies after death to be presented before the trybunall seate of Christ, to be of him most iustly iudged to abyde the pronouncynge of sentence to bée accused of the Deuylls, and of our owne concience, and to be séene and found vicyous before him. Also the consideration of the last generall iudgement which is to come in the

end of the world. Which wilbe so terryble as no tongu

                   is able to conceyue the same. Therefore whosoeuer doth déepaly consider how miserable sorowful and horrible a thing it wilbe, then with body and soule to goe downe into the infernall pitt, to fall headlong into euerlasting

                   and societie of Deuills, and to be there vncessantly tormented more then can be told: That man doubtlesse will auoyde and eschewe sinnes. Who so euer wil bewayle those whiche hée hath already commytted, will kéepe his hart with fearefull watch.
               Fourthly, the effectuall consideration of the whole infernall  punyshement. And therefore if he which is delighted and alured with vanytie of hart or voluptousuesse of the fleshe in this world, would rightly wey and consider vnto how great desolacion and eternall payne (yea, the plenteous fulnesse of all calamyties and miseryes) those delightes doe leade him, he would vtterly abhorre them and flye frō them. O my most entierly beloued brother, would God that these thynges dyd sauour and were vnderstoode of thée, as it is méete and right that they should. For then thou wouldest most readely dispyse the world. For behould who would now lye but the space of one houre in a hott burnyng furnace, to gayne all the world thereby? Wherfore then doest not thou eschewe daily sinnes? For the which so great payne must bée suffered, yea much more gréeuous then any punyshement which maye bée geuen in this present liefe. But these foule considerations whereof I last spake which with drawe vs from sinne, doe principally pertayne vnto foolyshe and vnperfect men. Which declyne from vyces rather by feare of euill then by loue of goodnesse.
               
               Fyftly, then the consideration of that highest and incomprehensible heauenly felycity which God will geue to those that for his loue doe eschewe and hate sinnes, is of great power to withdraw vs from sinne. Synce the hope

                     •…
                  s if a man (which thinketh &amp; cōsidereth that without the abundant grace of God, he can not flye from nor 
                     〈◊〉
                   sinnes) doe therefore neuer cease to pray hartely vnto God for grace to liue vertuously. For we must (as our sauiour sayeth) alwayes pray and neuer cease.
               Seuenthly, the consideration of the diuyns presence is chiesly auaylable to the eschuing of sinnes, by the which god doeth behold and consider vs euery where. By which consideration there aryseth in vs a chaste shamefastnesse from doing of any thing that is dishonest.
               Eightly, the consideration of his benifits.
               Furthermore, it appertayneth vnto thē which are perfect, to auoyde sins, chiefly by cōsideration of the diuyne goodnes, before whome (in sin) the frayle goodnesse is preferred.
               Also by consideration of ye diuyne maiestie, which by deadly sinne is infinitely dishonored.
               
               Agayne, by consideration of the diuyne holinesse and equitie

               And lykewyse by consideration of the diuyne charitie, by  the which God did first loue vs.
               Moreouer, by the verie loue of vertue and purenesse, and  the horror of the deformitie of sinne. As a vertuous man did affyrme saying: Although I knew that God would forgiue 
                     〈◊〉
                  , yet would I not

                   these.

               The second is the dispising of worldly men and their pratses, yea though thou be in all things contemned, reproued, and troubled without cause giuen. For so is the swelling of pryde repressed, and a singular grace obteyned of the Lord.
               The thirde, is a ghostly magnanimitie a stout mastership  ouer a mans self, without which a man is oftentimes enforced to cōmit such things as wold els displease him, &amp; to omit those things ye which hee would willingly doe.

               Furthermore, I iudge that nothing is more effectuall to the eschuing and auoyding of all euilles, to the resisting of

the diuill, to the profiting in all charitie vertue and grace, to the applying of holy workes, and to the earnest submission of a compunct, méeke, a holy mynde vnto God, then the inward, frequent, and diligent meditatiō of our Lords passion. For when we sée how much God loued vs, howe great patience, méekenesse, and humilitie Christ did shew &amp; teach in his passion: and how being stretched vpon the Crosse, hée prayed for them that killed him, by weying and déepely considering of all which things we shal throw frō vs, all pride, wrath, impatience, carnallitie, voluptuousnesse and enuye.

               Secondarily, he ought (so farre fourth as God wil graunt

the measure of his grace, and as in him lyeth) to flye and abhorre all sinne. Forasmuch as sinnes doe (in such maner as is before rehearsed) hinder the increase of grace, the feruētnesse of charitie, and the cleannesse of holy lyfe.
               Thirdly, he ought verie often tymes and most diligently  euerie day and night to consider his lyfe, to lament his offences, and the breach of the pre

For since there is no difference (as Saint Thomas affyrmeth) in the vndiuydable actions of men, so that euerie action of man procéeding from deliberation of reason, eyther profiteth or anoyeth: it is certayne that vnlesse a man (in all things that he doeth) doe circumspectly behaue him selfe in euerie poynt, he shall light into many sinnes.

To conclude the more preryous that thy soule is then thy body, so much the more diligently sée that thou loue, séeke, and heape vp, the spirituall rytches, the inward comelynesse and decking of vertues, before the outward garnyshing of the body and garmentes.

And agayne hée sayth: Whatsouer is written in holy scriptures is veritie. Whatsoeuer is therein commaunded, is honesty, and whatsoeuer is therin promised is true and perfect felicitye. This is then the most holesome and profitable study, which teacheth a man to know himselfe to correct his lyfe, and to procéed in all goodnesse by the grace of the holy spirite. And therevpon Augustine warneth vs saying: Use reading of holy scriptures for thy glasse, whereby thou mayest moue any blott or blemishe that thou findest in thy selfe. Yea theu mayest therein learne to preserue whatsoeuer thou perceiuest to be fayre in thée, by doing that which is fayerer then it séemeth to be. For the worde of god is most plentyfull, conteyning in it all delights. And therin (as in a myrrour) when we doo looke and gaze with the eyes of our inward mynde, we doo also sée and behold the secret shape of our soules. Yea we may thereby perceiue how much we haue profited, or how much we are gone a straye frō perfection. Wherevpon Isodorus sayth: The reading of holy scriptures doth yéeld prosit. For it doth not onely teath &amp; instruct a mans mynde, but it bringeth backe to the loue of god such as are by vanyties abstract and caryed into concupiscence. Can any study then be compared to y• study of this wysdome? No surely. For as Gregorie sayth: Euen as the holy scriptures doo excell aboue all other knowledge &amp; learning without cōparisō, teaching vs the perfect trueth, calling vs to ye heauēly habitatiō, inuyting and prouoking y• readers hart frō worldly desirs, to thēbraceing of high &amp; heauēly treasurs, being neither so darke yt they are to be dred nor yet so plaine y• they are to be dispised: euē so doth the vse and exercise thereof take away all wearinesse, and the more they are red the more they delight, surpassinge all other scyences euen in the maner of writing

The which wayes and pathes are by good reason tearmed bright and shinyng, sithens they haue their originall beginning of Gods grace and charitie, which are the supernaturall lightes of the soule. Yea bicause with their brightnesse they chase darkenesse from the myndes of men, they vnite and knit togither our hartes to the vncreated and heauenly light, and make him which (exerciseth himselfe therein,) to s

Furthermore this pathe and way of the iust, doeth procéede from good to better, from imperfection, to perfection, from one vertue to another, from the way vnto the ende of the iourney, yea and it increaseth

vntill it be broad day. That is to say vntill the euerlastyng day appeare. For as much as it ryseth (by fayth) to the speciall kynde of the thing sought for. Euen vnto the euerlasting and most blessed fruition and visien of the highest and most reuerend Trinitie and Godheade. This is the way of the chosen, the vnspotted way, the way of all vertue, leading (by the trauayle of repentance) vnto euerlasting rest and quyet. And of this way the Psalmist sayth: Blessed are they whosePsal. 118. wayes are vncorrupted, and which walke in the lawes of the Lord their God. And therevpon Iob sayde: I kepte theIob. 21. way of the lord, and did not decline from it. As also IeremieHiere. 6. sayde: Aske which is the good way, and walke therein, and you shall fynde a refreshing for your soule. But now: there is another way of the reprobate, a darkesome way, (that is to say) a wicked and vngodly way, which lacketh the light of true vnderstanding, &amp; is not guyded with the light of grace. But is obfuscate and darkened with ye cloudes of passions and concupisēces, peruerting &amp; ouerthrowing all iust iudgements, &amp; leadeth to the dungeon of infernal darknesse. This way is séene by vitious qualities, vnbrydeled appetites, cō
                  cupiscence of ye flesh, wicked thoughts, euil déedes, vnséemely and vnlawful talke, and neclecting of tyme. The which doe so ouershadow and darken the eyesight of the mynde, chat it can not sée the spirituall ruyne and ouerthrow into the which it dayly falleth headlonges. For in this slippery and damnable way, (which séemeth good vnto the wicked, although the end thereof doe leade vnto death) men fal from the highest, vnchaungeable, and moste blessed God, vnto a chaungeable, frayle, and vayne apparaunce of goodnesse, from the state of grace and saluation, vnto the state of gylte and condempnation, from a spirituall lyfe, to a carnall lyfe, and in the ende, from the right waye to the infernall pryson. Of the which way or wayes (being wicked as aforesayde) it is written: you blushe and be ashamed of your wayes. And therefore (my beloued) goe notEccle. 5

For whosoeuer followeth ye things which delight the fleshe and the outwarde sences, whosoeuer doeth imbrace the loosenesse of his hearte, and the ioyes of this world, hée doubtlesse walketh in a darke and daungerous way. But hée that walketh accordyng to thePsalm. 118. preceptes and lessons of the Gospell, hée chuseth vnto him the brighte way of the electe, and may saye with the Psalmist: I haue kepte my féete from all euill wayes, that I might kéepe thy wordes. For the worthie and perfect fulfillyng whereof let vs praye dayly, or rather hourely, with deuout mynde, saying: Dyrecte my steppes accordyng to thy worde, and no vnrightuousnesse shall haue the vpper hande of mée.
               The Apostle Paule in his seconde Chapiter to the GalathyansOf three sundry sortes of trauaylers in these pathes. sayeth: I am fastened to the Crosse in Christ. Yet liue I, not I, but Christ liueth in mée.
               And whereas I now lyue in the fleshe, I liue in the fayth of the sonne of God which loued mée, and gaue himselfe for mée.
               And surely this is the holesome doctrine of christian religion. That for the transgression of our forefathers, all mākind was depryued of their pleasant habitation in the terrestiall Paradyce, and throwne out into this world, as into a vale of miserie, into a place of banishment, and a countrey far from our natiue residence. To the end that through the bloud of Christ Iesu, we might in this worlde shewe the fruites of true repentaunce, and incessantly bewayle our owne calamitie, vntil we may be thought worthie after this life, to enter into the place of rest, or euerlasting kingdome prepared for the elect children of God.
               Wherevpon Gregorie sayeth: wée went from our countrey (meanyng the terrestryall Paradyse) for our pryde, disobedyence, followynge of the visible goodnesse, and tasting

of the fruite prohibited, but wee muste returne therevnto agayne by humilitie, obedience, contempnyng of the visible goodnesse, and by brideling our carnall appetytes. And therefore in this lyfe we are called Trauaylers or wafaring men, bicause as the Apostle sayth: We haue not hereHebr. 13. any certayne residence, but we must séeke for it in the world to come. And agayne in another place he sayth: whilest we2. Cor. 5. are in this corporall bodie, we dwell as strangers from the Lord. For we walke by fayth, and not accordyng to our outward forme. And in lyke maner the Psalmist singing speakethPs
                        •…
                     l. 38. vnto God and sayeth: Hold not thy peace though I be a strāger &amp; an alien in thy sight, as all my forefathers were. Now it is expedyent for a prouydent and circumspecte trauayler, that hauing necessarie thyngs for his iourney, hée loade not nor ouer charge not him selfe with other things, nor that hée staye in hys waye without some reasonable and vrgent cause. Neyther yet that hée busie hym selfe to entermedle with thinges done by other men whome hée passeth by in his iourney, but that holding the kings highe way, and neyther declining on the righte haude nor on the lefte hande, and being contented with necessarie foode &amp; apparell, he make hast, &amp; incessantly trauayle with all possible spéede to drawe néere vnto his iourneys end. So ought euerie Christian to consider that he is but a trauayler or a wayfaring man in this present lyfe, and therefore let him so order his whole conuersation, that hee obtayne the felicitie which is to come, and to attayne to the heauenly and euerlasting kingdome of God. Yea let him direct all his steps vnto the glorie of God, fulfilling his holy commaundementes, and by such vertuous degrees, let him aspyre vnto the heauenly habitation. For héere vnto the Apostle Paule doeth exhorteCor. 7. vs saying: it remayneth that they which vse the benifites of this world, should bee as though they vsed it not. And that they which be maryed, should bee as if they were vnmaryed. For the outward shewe of this world shall passe ouer. And agayne in another place he sayth: Pauing meat,

But happie is he which so knoweth his habitation that he may say with the Prophet, woe is mée that my resting place is prolonged. He that so sayth, and so couetethPsalm. 11

                     . to come vnto the euerlasting habitation, he is worthily to be called a true trauayler, and one that goeth in the right readie way. But bicause it happeneth oftentymes that a trauayler séeing sundrie straunge things in his way, is delighted therewith, and stayeth to behold such things, or to seeke and inquire of nouelties, whereby he foresloweth his 
                     •…
                  ourney, and remembreth not the countrey which hée hath to trauayle vntoo: but rather is so drowned in the delights of strange countreys, that hée taryeth there for altogither, and neuer commeth to his iourneyes end. Therefore there is a playner and more perfect way whereby we may goe to the countrey of the chosen. Which is: that a man doe goe not onely by the wayes and meanes alreadie declared, towardes the heauenly habitation, but furthermore that hée doe not regarde, care for, or séeme to sée, anye impediment, stoppe, or let, in his way. But rather passe by them and dispise them as things which appertayne not vnto him. And such trauaylers or wayfaring men are they which care no more for the prayses and commendation of this world, thē they doe for their disprayses, no more for prosperitie thē for aduersitie, for ryches, then for pouertie. Finally, which doe not (worldly) set their myndes on any of the thinges which delight men in this lyfe, but doe (mortifyedly) set lighte by them all, as by most vayne trifles and toyes. Unto the which perfection the Apostle doeth exhort vs saying: wée must alwayes beare aboute vs in our bodies, the 
                     〈◊〉
                   of Christ Iesus, that his lyfe may be made manifest in this our mortall fleshe. And such were they to whom the same ApostleColos

the dayes of man. And suche are all they which doe not glorie but in God the Lord, &amp; which made them selues strangers and alliens from this worlde. And suche an one may properly bée called deade vnto the worlde. And yet there is another way higher and more perfect then these.

And such were the most blessed Apostles, who being scourged and reproued by the high priestes, did goe away reioysing oute of the sight of theyr consistories, that they were thought worthie to suffer that continually for the name of Iesus. Consider then (my welbeloued) in which of these thrée kyndes or sortes of Trauaylers thou arte to bée accompted. For he which doeth onely attayne vnto the first rehearsed degrée, let him not thereby boast that he is in suretie of saluation. And therefore it shall bée thyne industrye not to be contented with the first degrée, but that thou haue desyre of (passing by the seconde) to clyme vnto the thyrde degrée of perfection. That leadyng a heauenly and angelycall lyfe in the fleshe, and dayly increasing in all fayth, charitie, knowledge, and grace, thou mayest bée accompted amongest the sonnes of the holye and glorious God, and not bée foreslowed after thy departure from the glorie of his maiestie.

                   which leadeth vnto distruction: and many there he which goe in the reat. But the way is straight and the gate narow which leadeth to euerlasting life, and fewe there be which fynde it out. These wordes procéeded from our sauiour Christ, and are reported by his Euangelist saint Mathew. And what could haue bin spokē more terrible then these wordes? or what soundeth more thundringly in our eares? It had bene sufficient to terrifie the stoutest hart, if Christ had onely sayde: The way of saluation is straight, and broad or wide opē is the way of dampnatiō
                  ▪ Whereby it might haue bene sufficiētly apparāt how hard it is to be saued, and how eas

                  erie many doe walke in the voyde open way to dampnation. Whereby he doeth ensinuate also that right fewe shal be saued, and verie many dampned. The which he doth more euidently set downe in another place saying: Many are called, but fewe are chosen. Therefore who would notMath. 22. feare, yea and tremble to heare these wordes, if he be of the faythful, and haue obteyned a liuely beliefe in Christ Jesus? For the faith and true dutie of a christian is such and so misticall, so great and yet so difficult, that although we certainly know by the testimonie of Gods spirite the certaintie of our saluation in Christ, yet should euerie wayfaring man in this worlde doe verie well to feare and forecast least hée in respect of infirmitie of fleshe should fall and offende, and so

consequently should doe well to walke in dread and reuerence before the Lord God. For as we are bound to beleue that after this transitorie lyfe we shall be brought before the Tribunall seate of Christ, the euerlasting God, and infallyble, dreadfull, and moste iuste iudge: there to receyue from him eyther euerlasting paynes of hell fyre, or the euerlasting ioyes of heauen: euen so if we behold the same with a cleare and lyuely fayth, it were wonderfull if euer wee should be frée from trembling and dread. But the malice and necligence that is in vs doeth blynde our hartes. For if we were to passe through a field or place full of théeues, wherin fewe passengers or wayfaring men had escaped, who were he that would not feare excéedingly to light in danger of corporall death? But now we passe and walke dayly through a fielde of this wicked worlde, replenished with all kynde of diuilish temptations. Wherein (as is abouesayde) verie fewe in comparison doe escape dampnation. Neyther yet doe we feare but laugh, playe, sporte, and banquet. Yea we are throughly replenished with a vayne and moste perillous securitie or carefulnesse. But (my welbeloued) let it not bee so, let it not (for Gods sake) beé so amongest vs. Let vs not so superficially heare the wordes of Christ, least we neglect, yea and loose our selues in vnrecouerable, vntollerable, and eternall distruction. Let vs rather profoundly, and cunningly, fulfill the wordes of our sauiour, thinking alwayes vpon that which is written: Sanctifie the Lorde ofEsay. 8. Hostes, for he is your feare, and your terrour. And agayne:Prou. 13. Be thou all day in the feare of God, &amp; thou shalt haue wheron to hope in the latter day. Wher vpon Hieremie also consideringHiere. 10. these things sayd: There is no man lyke vnto thée (O Lorde) thou arte greate, and thy name is also greate in strength. And who shall not be afeard of thée O King of kingdomes? Where vpon it is also written: Great &amp; wonderfull are thy workes (O Lord God omnipotent) iust andApoc. 7. true are thy wayes (O Lorde) and King of all worldes. Who wil not magnifie and feare thy holy name, bicause thy

iudgements are manifest? But before I wade any further, let me say a little of the wordes before rehearsed of our saui
                     •…
                  ur Christ. For he sayth that the way is narow &amp; the gate straight, which leadeth to saluation. Or rather (as I take it) he sayth that ye way is verie narow, &amp; the gate very straight. For in y• he demaundeth interrogatiuèly, how straight is the way. &amp;c. It is to be vnderstood y• he ment very straight and narow. But he plainly affirmeth that the way is broad and spatious which leadeth to euerlasting dampnatiō. And by the wordes before rehearced, the vnderstanding hereof is made manifest. For as I haue a little before alledged, there are two kyndes of wayes which men walke in. One bright &amp; vertuous, (the which is the way of the chosen, which fearfully and carefully serue the Lord God) &amp; that is the straight and narrow way. For as much as knowledge and vertue are alwayes occupyed about hardest things. (As I will hereafter more playnly declare.) And there is another vitious &amp; darksome way, which is the way or lyfe of the reprobate, the which is accoumpted broad and spatious, bicause it is an easie matter to declyne from the rules of reason, or to faynte from the right lyne of vertue, and to omit the diuine lawes of Gods commaundements. And yet about this poynte the Philosophers had some question: not altogither vnprofitable héere to be rehearsed. For whereas by their opinion, reason coueteth alwayes to the best things, &amp; vertue (by Damascenes opinyon) is accordyng to nature consenting vnto reason: yea and by Tullyes, or rather by Augustines and Basiles opinion, there are certayne sparkes or séedes of vertues borne and bredde in vs, it might séeme thereby that vertue were verie easie and light to be followed. Whervnto I would answere that God surely hath put in vs by regeneration wil to follow vertues wherby (by grace) they might séeme light and eas

we brought with vs, the which doth cōtinually make foure great &amp; deadly woundes in our soules) to wete: ignorance in vnderstāding, malice in willing, infirmitie in passion, &amp; concupiscēce in appetite or desire. Moreouer by y• Philosophers

Whereby our soule hath great néede of the incessaunt helpe, motion, inspyration, and grace of God.

and the world also doeth present many (nay to many) offences and lets from doing well &amp; vertuously. So that it is verie harde alwayes to kéepe in the meane and middle of vertue, and neuer to decline to any of the vitious extreames. But yet (as Dyonisius teacheth) vertue it selfe, or the action therof procéedeth of an entire and vniuersal cause, wherin all the circumstances of vertue it self doe concurre. But vyce doth consist of the defect or imperfection of any circumstance, and is commonly séene to erre, fayle, and perish by infinyte meanes. Wherevpon Salomon sayde: The number of fooles is infinite. So that we sée suffitiently howe theEccle. 1. way of vertue is straight and narow. But the way of vyces is spatious and large.

Notifying thereby the wordes before rehearsed to prous the small number of them which shal be saued. And furthermore for the better vnderstanding howe straight and narow the way is which leadeth to saluation, marke we the words of Gregorius saying: The straight and narow way wherin euerie man is constrained to walk, (which doth carefully regard the fulfilling of Gods commaū

To couet none other mens goods, neither yet gréedily to retaine our owne, to dispise the prayses of y• world, to loue (for god) to be reuiled, to flie frō glory, to folow y• which is dispised, to hate flattery, to honor such as set light by ye world, to forgiue thē which offēd vs frō our harts, and to cōserue ye grace of charitie vnmoueably in all things.

Let vs labour therfore stoutly, &amp; fight hardly agaynst vyces. Yea let it be most pleasant vnto vs to be weryed in the seruice and warres of God.

What rages, what furyes, what coldes, what perylles, by sea, by lande, in dennes, in deserte, doe

huntesmen hazard for the poore praye of a selly beast? Yea how longe can they hunger and thirst, and how vyle meates can they be contented with all, for the obteyning of the same? men suffer thēselues to be cut &amp; launced, to be burnt &amp; seared, that they may remoue (no euerlasting payne) but a payne of smal cōtine waūce, wt a payne of greater patiēce. The Knight and souldiers vndertake most crewel warres for small &amp; tryflyng pleasures in this shorte and vncerteyne lyfe. Yea they spende oftentimes more yeares in attayning theyr desires, then they lyue afterwardes to enioye them.

and with all thy power. And this cōmaundement conteineth in it the ende, the rule, and the perfection of all the commaundementes. To the full accomplyshement whereof (as much as maye possibly by vs be performed) not onely all the other commaundementes, but all the dyscyplyne of Christ in his holy gospell, doe also tende. And this commaundement is not fully fulfilled and accomplyshed at any tyme in this world, vntill we come to the euerlasting kyngdome prepared. Yet such as with full deuoytion and syncerity of mynde doe renounce and forsake all worldly vanities which may hynder their loue towards the diuyne Maiestie, and doe onely bend theyr eyes towards God accordinge to their dewty, doe goe nearest to the accomplyshment and fulfillynge of this commaundement. But when we haue done all that we can, yet are we vnprofitable. And yet euery wayfarynge man which iornyeth and trauayleth in this lyfe to attayne vnto the euerlastinge kyngdome, must thus farreforth fulfill it, that hée loue nothing more then GOD, nor nothyng that is contrarye to his will. Yea and that hée reioyse finally in nothyng but in GOD onely. Now then wée haue sayd much of this streyght and narrowe waye to saluation. And thereby it falleth out that it is the obseruing and kéepyng of Gods commaundementes in holy scryptures conteyned, and of the lessonnes taught vs by our sauiour Christ. Let vs then also consider which bée those streyght commaundementes and preceptes, for the dificulty whereof Christ hymselfe dyd affyrme that the sayd waye was so streyght and the gate so narrowe. And againe that the waye was so brode and spatyous which led vnto euerlastinge damnation. Behold our sauiour sayth then: You haue hard it sayd (quod hée) Thou shalt not kyll. But I say vnto you that whosoeuer is angrye with his brother, shalbe gyltie in iudgement. But hée which sayth vnto his brother Racha: (That is a worde of dysdayne or reproche) he shalbe gylty to be condempned by ye whole councell. And

But let your communycatioō be yea: yea: and nay: nay: Where vpon also the apostle James in his Epistle sayth: My brethren aboue all thinges sweare not. Agayne our Sauyour sayeth: Resist you not the euill dooer. But if any man stryke you on the left chéeke, turne the other vnto him hlso. And he which will contende with thée in Judgement and take thy cote from thée, geue him also thy cloke.

And yet as Hierome sayth, it is necessarye towardes saluation. Naye rather (sayth he) he which hateth any one man, doth loue no man truely and spirytually. No neyther can he loue himselfe, nor God, being in such gréeuous and heynous sinne.
               Furthermore our Sauiour sayth: If you doe not forgeueMath. 6. offences one to another neyther will your heauenly fatherMat. 7. forgeue you your sinnes.

Some other are of conncell and aduyse, which neuerthelesse are to be obserued of as many as professe Christ sincerely. Yea futhermore the selfe same may apeare by dyuers other Scryptures. For the Apostle sayth: They which are of Christ haue crucifyed theyr fleshe with the vyces and concupysences thereof. Whosoeuer therfore doe not extinguish vyce and concupisence, nor chastyse theyr bodyes, they then perteyne not vnto Christ. Agayne: A wyddowe (saith he) which liueth in delightes, is dead liuing. For though she liue by lyfe of nature, yetis she dead by the death of punishment and iudgement. Then if delightful lyfe be a fault or sinne in wyddowes, how much more blameful is

it to be thought in such as ought by reason of their

And these (welbeloued) I haue here thus rehearced, to the end I might thereby induce thée to the feare of God, the watchful care of thy harte, and to the diligent reading of scripturs, least thou shouldest in vayne flatter thy selfe with gods mercye. And so become one of their socyetie which walke in the broad and spatyous waye. For as the Apostle sayeth: If we suffer with Christ, wée shall also reygne with Chryst. If wée bée pacyente wyth him, wée shall also lyue wyth him. Yea, and must we not accordyng to the Apostles wordes, entre into heauen by many trybulations? But it is true (which GOD forbyde should be verified in thée) which Bernard sayth: Lorde many would reigne with thée, but they will not suffer with thée. Many would be with thée but fewe will folowe thée. Many would finde thee but fewe doe seeke thee. Therefore let vs not be afeard to beare trybulations synce Hierome sayth: No seruaunt of Christ is without trybulation. And if thou suffer no tribulation, it seemeth thereby that thou hast not begonne to be the seruaunt of God.

               These wordes our sauiour Christ spake of himselfe. Wherwith we must vnderstand that the yoke of Christ is none other thing then the lawe of the Gospell, or the performaunce and wary heede of Gods commaundementes. By the which we are bounde vnder the obedyence of his holy will, and are restreyned or seperate from this worldely lyfe.
               
                  And the burden of our Sauiour may be vnderstoode by the obseruation of his holy wordes. And of such a yoke it is wrytten: It is good for the man which hath borne the yoke (euen from his youth) which the reprobate doe put from them. According to that sayinge of Hieremye from the begynnyng thou hast broken and cast of the yoke and sayed: I will not serue.

For if it be perfect loue in dede, it ouercōmeth al things &amp; yet féeleth no paynes. The loue of God is an infallyble treasure. He that hath it, is rytch.

                  , is of him right hartely loued and desired. Then if we déeyely and effectually consider that it is for Gods loue that we doe such thinges as we take in hand, we shall then thinke nothing to be hard or difficulte. Nay rather if we should all dye for him, or execute and fulfill all verteous exercyses for his sake, we shall it be able to doe nothing worthy of the benifites which we haue receaued at his handes. And therevpon Gregorius sayth if the mynde be ones fixed in God with a stedfast entent, then we estéeme all thinges to be swéete and pleasaunt howe bytter or sower so euer they chaunce to be. Yea, we shall fynde greate rest and quyet in all those thinges which doe afflict vs.
               Futhermore it is certayne, that the more a mans mynde be bent vnto any one thing earnestly, somuch the more his entontions towards any other thinge be slackened and laide asyde. Then euen as the louers of this world (which doo altogether wrappe and enfold themselues in the desyres therof, &amp; are altogether occupyed in vayne and transitory things) doe (as it were) lothe and are weary of spirituall and godly thinges, yea as they d

Yea they desyre and reioyse to be vncessantly occupyed and conuersant in the prayses of God, and walke in the streight &amp; narrowe way with great delight and pleasure. Herevpon it is that Gregorius wytnesseth saying: loue is as strong as death. For (sayth he) euen as death doth kyll the corporall body, so the loue of God dothe (through the hope of eternall lyfe) kyll in vs the loue of temporall delightes. For he whome the charitie of GOD dothe swallow vp, hym dothe it also make vnsensyble too the féelynge of anye

externall desyers. For it is of necessitie that the swéetenesse of Chryst Jesus, should make sower and vnpleasant the tast of this lyfe. These thinges then haue I here sayed to the ende that I maye turne thée (my welbeloued) from the

               The frendship of this world is hateful &amp; enemy to god. TherWhat it is to contempne and despise the wordly. fore whosoeuer coueteth to be frendly vnto this worlde, hée shall therby become an enemy vnto god.

And in the sonnes of the diuill, the loue of this world, yea the pryuate, inordynate, and wicked lust thereof (which vnto godly charite are strong poysō) doo reigne &amp; preuayle altogither. The whole text thē of holy scripturs doth exhort vs vnto ye extyrpatiō &amp; rooting vp of this priuate &amp; worldly loue. As also it encourageth vs to the prositable procéedings in charity &amp; the loue of god &amp; our neighbor. Furthermore yt is priuate loue by yt which we are turned backe &amp; bend to estéeme our selues vitiously. That is to say: by coueting those things which are profitable &amp; delightfull to

our nature, more then yt things which pertayne vnto god. As for example, riches, delights, honour, prayse, and such other worldly vanities. But he which doth truely loue him self (in god) doth cōtēpne &amp; throw away all those things as vile &amp; abiect. I meane the superfluous vse therof, &amp; I take this worde Contempning, or vtter mislyking for the full and extreme Contempning or mislyking that a christian ought to haue thereof.

Herevpon aryseth a question, how it were to be vnderstoode that the holy scriptures doe commaund vs to hate and dispise this world. But if you marke my wordes well, you shall perceyue, that since euerie man which loueth the worlde doeth thereby become an enimie vnto God, it falleth out also that the contempt of thys world is of necessitie vnto saluation. Wherevpon some curious mynd might in
                     •…
                  erre that all secular people which are maryed and therby doe loue eche other, should (hereby) stand in state of condempnation. Wherevnto I answere that loue is to be taken diuers wayes, as well in Philosophie, as also in diuinitie. For both Plato &amp; Pythagoras did exhort theyr schollers and sects to dispyse the world. But to come vnto a more perticuler distinction.
               First the world is taken for the Element of earth, or for the whole globe and compasse of this earthly habitatiō. And so it is taken in the Gospell where Christ spake vnto his Apostles saying: Goe you out into the whole world and preach the Gospell to all creatures. And the Philosophers doe say that the least Starre of the fyrmament is bigger then the whole world.
               Secondarily, it is taken for the whole regyon of the Elements and their myxtures. Wherevpon it may be that the Apostle sayd: The fygure of this world doth passe ouer. And to that sence the Prince of Philosophers sayde. This world

(sayeth hée) must be adioyning vnto the cources of the higher powers. That the whole vertue and power thereof may thereby be gouerned.
               Thirdly, the worlde is taken for the whole corporall substāce created▪ And so Plato in his booke de Timaeo, doth séeme to bring in the s
                     •…
                  nsible world.
               Fourthly, the world is taken for ye whole vniuersal thing, in the which visible and vnuisible separate and materyall substances are comprehended. And thereof this text may be ment: The world was made by him. Yea so also the Philosopher sayeth: Nothing is without the world.
               Fiftly, by the world is taken for men remayning in thys world, or for all mankynd. Whervpon it was that the Apostle sayde: Let all the whole worlde be subi
                     •…
                  cte vnto God. And Christ him selfe sayde: This Gospell of the kyngdome shall be preached and declared in the whole world.
               Sixtly, the world is taken for the chosen and predestinate vnto saluation. Whervpon we read: So God loued ye world that he gaue his onely begotten sonne. &amp;c.
               Seuenthly, the world is taken for the peruerse and reprobate. Wherevpon our sauiour sayde vnto the Iewes: you are of this world. But I am not of this world (that is to say) of the number of vngodly men, leading a vayne and worldly lyfe. Of which number you are your selues. And agayne he sayde vnto his Apostles: Bicause you are not of y• world, but I haue chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. And in this sence ye world is most commonly taken in scriptures, especially in the Gospell and Epistles of Saint Iohn.
               And last of all, a father of the Church which hath written a treatise of the vanitie of this world, doeth take this word: The world for the changeablenesse of mans conuersation in this lyfe. Since then the holy scriptures doe bid the worlde to be contempned and hated, according to that saying: Loue you not the world nor those which are therein.
               Therefore by this word: The world we must vnderstand

worldly and vayne creatures bent vnto transitorie and not vnto heauenly things. Yea and there with must we comprehend earthly substance, and such thinges as the worldlings doe most accoumpt, as temporal prosperitie, carnal delights, to be praysed and honoured, and to become rich and clyme alofte. For all these sensible and temporall things are to bée contempned and hated. Not as touching their verie beyng, but bicause they hynder and stoppe vs in the way, and foreslow our iourney vnto the heauenly kingdome. And we must contemp
                     •…
                  e and hate them, least we doe cleaue and stick fast in the myre of them. As they doe which sette theyr chiefe end and felicytie in frayle and transitorie things, séekyng, louyng, wyshing, and desiryng them more then they doe God.
               Therefore whensoeuer wée sée any man to prosper excéedingly in this world, and to leade a voluptuous conuersation accordyng to his appetite, let vs neither estéeme nor magnifie him. Let vs not affect such kynde of lyfe, nor greatly set by (but rather dispyse) suche a man. I meane not that wée shoulde hate hym in nature, nor dispyse his person absolutely, but hys vyces, and him selfe, in so much that by them he is eloygned and estranged from God.
               Wherevpon the Psalmist sayeth of the iust man: ThePsal. 14. wicked was brought to naught in his sight. But suche as feare God, hee glorifieth. Aristotle in hys Ethyckes hath this sentence: Magnanimytie is full of contempt, for it setteth light by those which lyue vylely.
               All this notwithstanding, we ought to bestow the affects of charitie and godly compassion vpon those which are wycked and vniust, accordyng to their necessitie. Yea and muche the more bycause we sée them to be wrapped and enfolded, yea blynded and muffled to reioyce, florish, and exalte themselues in this worlde. And therevpon Hierome sayeth: wée more weigh &amp; marke sinners to be most wretched, when we perceyue their faultes to be lefte vnpunished. Yea both hée and Ambr
                     •…
                  se say: There is no certayner token or signe of a

reprobate sence, and damnation to ensue, thē to prosper and to be without any crosse or punishment in this lyfe. Especially
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     . 3. since the Lord sayth: I cha
                     •…
                  tise and rebuke those whom I loue. Now therefore let vs well consider how it comes to passe that the contempt and hatred of this world is of necessitie to saluation. For vnlesse it had bene by some maner of meanes necessarie to saluation, the Apostle Iohn had not sayde: if any man loue the world, the charitie &amp; loue of God
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     . Ioan. 2. the father is not in him. It is therefore to be sayd, that there are two kyndes of hating and 
                     〈◊〉
                   the world, speaking generally thereof.
               The first whereof is: that the world and such things as are therein should be contempned and hated, for as much as they doe directly hynder and withhold vs from God. That is to say, least they be loued more then God, or contrarie to his will and commaundements. And least any man should take felicitie in them, and cleaue wholly vnto them contrarie to the lawes of God in holy scriptures contayned. Least he preferre earthly goods before heauenly goods, and least hée set the temporall prayses and honours of this lyfe, before the celestial ioyes prepared. And finally, least he loue and estéeme this present lyfe more then the lyfe to come. And for these reasons the hating and dispising of the world are necessarie vnto saluation. So that euerie man is bound (in that sort) to hate &amp; dispise the world, as wel single men as maryed folke. The which lesson I iudge to be verie difficult vnto suche as dwel and remayne in this world. Now the second kynde or maner of dispising and hating the world, is executed by the ful and absolute aband
                     •…
                  ning &amp; denying of all worldly things. As if any man dispising and throwing from him the ryches and delightes of this lyfe, should choose to serue God in obscure and more priuate lyfe.
               So that (in this sence) to hate and dispise the world, is vtterlyHe meaneth not Monkes nor Fryers I trust. to refuse &amp; cast of all temporall things, seculer pomps, yea worldly maners and dignities, and so to dispise all the vanities of this lyfe that we may walke in the righte way

by the assistance of Gods grace and holy spirit. And whosoeuer doeth thus, he is sure to displease and offend worldly men. For euen as lykenesse of things is a cause of loue and well pleasing, so vnlikenesse is the originall cause and mother of hatred, and withdrawing of myndes and affections. Herevpon the Apostle asked this question: Doe I (sayth he) séeke to please men? If I should yet please men, I should not be the seruant of Christ. And lykewyse the Psalmist sayeth: God hath brokē in sunder the bones of such as séeke to please men. They were consumed bicause god dispised thē. Is not this a most horrible and dreadfull worde? For what can bée more fearefull then to bée dispised of God? since SalomonEccle. 7. sayeth: Consider the workes of God, since no man can amēd him which God dispiseth. And in this sort to dispise y• world, is not onely to hate and dispise all frayle, worldly, &amp; vayne things, in that they doe dyrectly, but in that they doe also chanceably let or hinder Gods creatures from attaining vnto him. As the wise man testifieth saying: They are as temptationSap. 14. to a mans soule, and as a Trappe or snare for the féete of the foolish▪ And therefore we hate them not onely for that they withhold vs directly, since Salomon sayeth: God madeEccle. 3. his workes to be feared. But also bicause euen chanceably they doe vaynely delight the reprobate with the comelinesse of his creatures, and with the perticular profit which they séeme to carry with them. So that they there doe stay and stand still 
                     •…
                  ternally, and neuer attribute the honour and glorie vnto the creator, who is in déede the onely end and scope wherevnto wée should tende and frame our doings.
               Héerevpon Isodorus sayeth: it is better to haue the hatred of the euill, then theyr company. For euen as the conuersation and lyfe of those which are godly doe render many commodities, so the company of the wicked doeth bryng with it many euilles.
               Now in this treatyse I intend to speake chiefly of the contempt of this worlde, as it is set downe in the seconde note. euen that which concerneth the state of perfection, and the

obseruing of Gods words. And yet I shall sometymes bring in somewhat of the former kynde of contempt, in as muche as it of necessitie towardes saluation and the fulfillyng of Gods commaundements.
               My parte (sayeth the Lorde) is my soule. And therefore I
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      three 
                        〈◊〉
                      which moue vs to contempne the world. wil expect and looke for the Lorde. For the Lorde is good to them which trust in him, and to the soule that séeketh hym. And as the scripture sayth: A thréefolde corde is hardly broken. Let vs therefore by a thréefold perswasion, and by a tripartyte kynde of demonstration, set downe howe holy, howe diuyne, and how acceptable, how holesome, howe noble, and how expedient it is altogither to contempne the worlde and those things which are therein. Now some perswading reasons or demonstrations of this blessed contempte, are to bee▪ vnderstoode on the behalfe of God. Some other on our owne behalfe, and some on the behalfe of the world it self. Whervpon orderly &amp; decently to procéed: on y• behalfe of God these things ought to induce &amp; beget in vs a contempt of ye world.
               First the loue and goodnesse of the glorious &amp; blessed God. Secondarily: The zeale that we haue to honour him perfectly as much as in vs lyeth.
               Thirdly, ye great benifits which we receiue at gods hands.
               Fourthly, the consideration of his promises.
               Fiftly, bicause god him self in proper persō did so coūsel vs.
               And lastly, bicause he did so him selfe. Of the rest I will treate hereafter. Now touching the loue and goodnesse of God it is written: Thy name and thy memoriall (O Lord)Esay. 26. are in the desires of my soule. My soule hath desired thée by night, yea thy spyrite is in the secretes of my harte, and early in the gray mornyng will I wayte for thée.
               Herein as goodnesse is the obiecte of our appetyte and desire, so since god is the highest, purest, vnmeasurable, &amp; perfectest goodnesse, so is he insinitely to be desired, &amp; to be loued. In such sorte that we ought beyond all comparison to loue him aboue all things. And so consequently, it is méete and requisite to dispyse, to refuse, and to caste away, whatsoeuer

may let, foreslow, or turne vs from his loue, and the feruentnesse therof. But the world and that which 
                     〈◊〉
                   thervnto, doe withdrawe vs, &amp; specially let and 
                     〈◊〉
                   vs from the loue and goodnesse of God (as Gregorie sayeth:) wée are euen so much disioyned and seperated from the loue of y• high God, as wée are wrapped in worldly thinges, delighted in base things, and occupyed in earthly things. For vertue is both greater and of more force when it is vnited, thē when it is dispersed) therfore the more that the 
                     〈◊〉
                   of our mynd are dispersed and deuyded into the inordinate loue of worldly creatures, the weaker also, colder, blynder, and more vnapte they be to loue God.
               Wherevpon Chrysostome sayeth: looke howe muche thy mynd is set vpon any thing, and euen so much the lesse it is set vpon God. For what are these earthly &amp; carnall things, but onely heauy wayghtes and burthens which draw down the affections of mans mynd from desire of heauenly things. Let vs therefore extend our whole harte vnto God. Let vs be borne vnto him with our whole mynde. Let him be such a cause of loue vnto vs in al other things, that we estéeme no worldly creature more thē for that it may (as a meane) serue vs towardes the attayning of his loue. That is to say, so far forth as it may bee vnto vs necessarie and profitable to further vs in our way towardes the heauenly kingdome. But let vs become so feruent in the loue of God, yea let vs so much estéeme his most swéete and delectable loue, that we may dispise all and singular other vayne and transitorie things as vyle durte. So that the omnipotent and eternall God may be more precious, more to be desired, more gloryous, swéeter, fayrer, and in (euerie kynde of comparison better,) of more perfection and worthinesse thē any other thing. And let any liuyng worldly creature be lothsome vnto our soules, being thus occupyed in contemplation of the diuyne maiestie. Let vs sée and perceyue hereby that the whole 
                     〈◊〉
                   world, (in respect or comparison of the vndiscrybable God) is but as a small title of no reputation or louelynesse.

Yea in such sorte that we thinke these transistorie thinges vnworthie to be looked on. But that we be wholly transformed, 
                     〈◊〉
                  , established, dissolued, and swallowed vp in Christ Iesus. So that we may say with his holy Prophet: The God of my harte, and God is my portion for euer.

Let vs therefore dispyseApoc. 1. all these things, and let our whole occupation, conuersation, entention, and affection, be fixed and altogither reposed in him onely which is onely necessarie to bee imbrased, accordyng to the admonition of Augustine. Let man (sayth hée) if he turne any way, conuert him selfe vnto him which created him: for by going backe from him, he waxeth cold, but by turning vnto him, he shall waxe warme. By going backe he shall waxe dimme and darke, but by turning to him, hée shall become bright and shyning. For euen where he receyued his creation and being, there must he also fetche his being good or godly. For he the Lord our God is ye verie swéetnesse, swéete aboue all kynde of swéetenesse.

But if they be ouerthrowne or sunken in earthly things, they rotte and consume immediately. And myne earnest desire is (my welbeloued) that thou doe spurne from thée and dispise all transitorie things, &amp; detest &amp; abhorre all the pompe of this world, for the loue of the diuyne bountie, and through the affection that thou haste to procéede in the imbrasing thereof. Yea and that by the desire of so contemplatyue and holy meditations, thou mayest with all thy hart and mynde be giuen ouer vnto him. All which can not come to passe vnlesse thou dispise all corporal delightes, all worldly vanities, and all thine owne desires. As Cassianus affyrmeth saying: our affectiōs (saith he) are neuer perfectly kindled to the desire of eternal things, neither is our vnderstandyng euer sharpened vnto the perfect contemplation of heauenly thinges, vntill the cares and desires of the fleshe bee perfectly bridled in vs. My (welbeloued) if thou wilt be rich, and a possessor of infinite goods and treasures, giue eare then vnto the counsell of Ambrose. He that wil (sayth he) possesse God, let him first renounce the world, that God may be vnto him a blessed possession and heritage. For looke how much thou dye vnto y• world, so much lyfe thou gaynest with God. And the more that thou lyue as to this worlde, so muche the more thou dyest vnto God.
               To conclude, whosoeuer loueth the world, doeth loue an enimie, imbraseth a Traytor, and dandleth in his lappe an vnspeakeable daunger.
               Wherevpon Augustyne sayde: if this world delight thée, thou shalt alwayes be vncleane. And if thou louingly kysse the worlde, he will hungrily and gréedily swallowe and deuour thée. And to make an end of thys deuision, wee ought aboue all things to loue God.
               First, for his vnmeasurable goodnesse.
               Secondarily, bicause he first loued vs.
               Thirdly, bicause he powreth so many benifits vpon vs.
               
                  Fourthly, bicause he hath promised to giue vs greater rewards in the heauenly kingdome. And to this feruentnesse of charitie let vs alwayes enforce our selues. For by Augustynes opinion: it is neyther the great number of workes, nor the long continuance of tyme, but the greater heate of charitie, and the better readinesse of our wil, which maketh God (for his Christ) to accept our merites. For whosoeuer doeth obserue charitie in all his actions, he fulfilleth as wel that which is apparant, as also that which is mysticall, in Gods booke. For charitie doth (as it were) open the mynde, and maketh the louer to be loued. O Lord my God thou arte

Is ther not in thée only (most holy, honorable, mighty &amp; glorious God) y• perfect possessiō, y• incomprehensible plētie, and y• infinit aboundance of all things y• are good, pleasant, or to be desired? Thē what is more excelēt, or more louely, y• I shuld therfore wtdraw my hart from thée, &amp; turn it vnto frail things, coueting or desiring any maner of thing without thée or besides thée? And where was I when I was not with thée? Whither ranne myne affections astray, when they did not desire thée onely? O God of my lyfe, howe vaynely is it consumed? And how vnfruitfully are my dayes stolen away whilest I liued idelly &amp; vnprofitably before thée? But fromPsal. 41. henseforwardes let my soule bee vnmoueably fixed in thée.

For euen as God (by reason of his vnmeasurable bountie, &amp; his infinite amyablenesse) is such that no man can loue him so much as he is worthie to be beloued, but doth infinitely fayle thereof. So by the reason of his maiestie, dignitie, and vnmeasured asured holinesse, he is infinitely to be honoured. So that euery man is much defectyue in doing of suche reuerence vnto him, as he (in him self doth deserue. And here vpon the holy fathers profoundlye pondering these considerations) did estéeme all their déedes &amp; conuersatiō, (how perfect so euer it were) to be of none effect. And therfore ye doctors say: A man shuld rather suffer death, thē commit ye least fault or offence wilfully. For as muche as sinne (in that it derogateth any thing from the excéeding great maiestie of God) is a huge and vnreasonable enormitie. Then if we do honor the excelent maiestie of God so much ye more, bicause by ye beholding &amp; consideratiō of his worthinesse we are able to dispise &amp; hartily to reiect all frail, vain, &amp; transitorie things: to the end yt being vnburthened and clean dispatched of them, we may attentiuely giue our selues to yt pure, frée, &amp; entire worshipping of ye same: it must néedes follow that they whi

And therefore (by his grace and mercies are made worthie to be glorified, honored &amp; extolled with him. And lykewise the lesse that a man doe occupie him selfe in many businesses, so much the more perfectly he is bent vnto the onely God. And so much y• loftier &amp; more sincere his mynde is, in the praysing of his name. Yea hée may so much the more be wholly at leysure to exercise him selfe in his seruice, and walke vprightly in all godlynesse.

honour, to refuse all worldly things fréely for the worshiping and glorifying of him, and to presēt our selues vnto him with full deuotion. And so do they which cōtempne the world in such maner as is beforesayd. And therfore to the end thou mayest vncessantly (as much as in thée lyeth) giue thy selfe vnto the praise, worship, and honour, of the diuyne maiestie, yea that thou mayest quyetly repose thy self in the swéet contemplation of his mercyes, reioyse in his blessednesse lyke a naturall louing chylde, and spend all the dayes of thy lyfe vertuously, I exhorte thée (my welbeloued) altogither to disspyse the world, and to passe ouer all the transitorie vanities thereof with a noble courage, yea to goe hartily to worke in the onely honoring of God.

And therefore the Apostle sayeth: As youRom. 5. haue giuen ouer your members to serue vncleannesse and iniquitie, so now (sayth hée) giue ouer your members to doe right

worthyly, &amp; to doe (for his honour) whatsoeuer we may possybly doe to please him, yea and yet neuerthelesse humbly to confesse that we doe nothing worthy of thankes or meryte. Therofore it is written: To gloryfie God as much as lyethEccle. 43. in vs shall preuayle with his mercy, and is beyonde all prayse. Deferre not then (my welbeloued) to geue whole possession of thy selfe and all that thou hast, thy body and thy soule, yea thyne inward thoughts and outward actions vnto the diuyne Maiestie.

               The Prophet Esay in his lxiii. Chapiter hath these words:How the consideration of gods benesits exhorteth vs to hate the world. I will remember the Lord for his mercy. Yea I will praise the Lord for all that he hath geuen vs, and for all that hée hath bestowed vpon vs according to his goodnesse. If then we would perfectly knowe how carefully we ought to séeke the way of saluation and walke therein, yea and how much we ought to dispyse the vayne delights of the world: Let vs héedely consider what the onely begotten Sonne of god, did, suffered, and toke vpon him, for our helth and saluation. If he then, through the wysdome and prouydence of God the father, yea through ye eternall, vncreated, vnbegottē, &amp; vnmesurable foresight dyd (not without great cause &amp; reason) take vpon him, doe, &amp; suffer, so many thinges for vs: If the onely begotten Sonne of God being perfect and o

Neither let vs thynke that we can be saued by sleighte and superficyall seruing of him, by cleauing vnto worldly vanyties, neyther yet by lyuing carelesly and without feare. For neyther is the euerlasting payne of dampnation so avoyded, nor yet the heuenly kingdome

is not so obteyned. For Christ suffered and was crucyfied for vs, that we might thereby folowe his stepes and example. Then is it necessary that we be conformed vnto his passion, and that we crucyfie our selues as he did. For whosoeuer sayth that he remayneth in God, must walke euen2. Tim. 2. as he walked. Where vpon the Apostle sayed: If we suffer with him, we shall reigne with him also. And againe he sayth: Be you folowers and imytators of god, as his bestEpho. 5. beloued children. And what els is it to be conformed vnto Christes passion, to dye with him, &amp; to folow his steppes, but euen to mortyfie all vanyties &amp; wickednesse, to cōstitute our bodyes wholy in y• feare of god, to restrayne &amp; bridle our owneZach. 9. natural lyberty, vnder ye cōmaundemētes of his holy lawes, &amp; to submyt our willes altogether vnto his godly will? for whē we know &amp; beleue yt our Lord &amp; Sauiour (Jesus Christ) did most patiētly suffer innumerable derysions &amp; mockes, slaunders, blasphemies, labours and paines, with all méekenesse ofMat. 11. pouerty, with all lowlynesse of minde, &amp; with all perfection of charytie, so as finally he suffered the most vyle kynde ofIob. 19. death for vs, let vs thynke that it were moste vndecent for ye seruaunt if he should liue in delightes, reioyse in worldly rytches, and wallowe in earthly vanyties, whose masterIob. 1

For god forbyd that thou shouldest be vngratefull for such and so many benefites And yet vngratefull shouldest thou be, if thou geue him not thankes for the same with thy whole hart. But thankes canst thou not geue vnlesse thou doe medytate, marke and acknowledge them. Synce the chiefe poynt of ingratitude (as Seneca sayth) is forgetfulnesse. Therefore cast and reuolue in thy mynde euery day what God himselfe dyd &amp; suffered for thée.

we become vnthankefull vnto God the most lyberall and abundaunt benefactor of all other. If any man should cut of thy hand or thy foote, how much wouldest thou thynke thy selfe bounde vnto him which would heale it agayne and restore thée thy member? If thou wert blynde, deafe, or lame, how much wouldest y• loue him which would cure thy defect? how then, art thou not ashamed in that thou louest not god feruētly, which hath geuē thée all those gyftes before named and hath also promysed thée farre greater then they? therefore let these great benyfites and lyberaltyes of god towards thée, styrre in thée a contempt of this world, and enduce thée to take in hand all such thinges, as may most lyuely expresse his honour and glory. For as it is moste certayne that he which is by nature best dysposed vnto vertue, were moste faulty if he should be blynded by the world to lyue vycyously, so (thou hauing good gyftes of nature) it were no small cause of gréefe if thou shouldest foreslowe thy selfe from executing the same.

For the thinges which are séene are temporall, but the things which are not séene are eternall. By these wordes of Paule it appeareth that the trybulations of the chosen (although they be longe, bytter, and gréeuous) yet by regarde of the celestyall glory and reward to come, they are lyght and but of small continewaunce. For the reward to come is vncomprehensible &amp; euerlasting. But now is he a perfect and most pure louer of God, which loueth him not by beholding this reward, nor reuerenceth him not for desire of his owne profite, nor worshipeth him for reward of mutuall consideration towardes himselfe: But which purely (for the very incomparable goodnesse, loue, and worthynesse of God) doth all that he can to his honour with all dilygence. For the better obteyning of

which perfection, and for the full purchasing of so great sinceritie in Gods loue, let vs yet euen by the beholding of the infallible promyses of God, goe stoutly forewarde to doe any thing that may be most pleasant, most perfect, and moste acceptable vnto him. And let vs contempne the world and the gallantnesse, delight, pompe, prosperities, and vanities therof, taking in hand to walke in the way of perfection, in the fulfilling of Gods word, and in a vertuous and right religious lyfe. For since the eternall God, is a most frée goodnesse, a most feruent charitie, and a most plentifull rewarder, therfore a man of reasonable vnderstanding wil confesse that the more he refuseth and layeth aside for his sake, the more sincerely that he renounce him selfe, the more he dispose him selfe to the obtayning of Gods giftes, and the more wholly, perfectly, and entyrely that he offer him self vnto him, euen so much the more will God also she we him selfe the more aboundant in mercies to him, the more soundly and swéetly he will breath his holy spirite into him, the more familiarly he will be conuersant with him, and the higher wil he exalte him in glorie, multiplying his giftes of grace in this present lyfe, and dooblyng his rewards of glorie in y• world to come. Whervpon it is written in holy scripture: if a man doe direct his harte vnto God, he shall drawe his breath and spirite towardes him selfe. And here vpon the holy, true, and mercifull God hath promised not onely a blessed and excelent glorification, in the heauenly kingdome, but also a most plentuous and liberall reward in this present lyfe, to suche as dispise the world for his sake. Saying in his holy gospel: Whosoeuer leaueth father &amp; mother, his brethren or frends, or his possessions for my names sake, he shal receyue an hundreth folde, &amp; shall possesse euerlasting lyfe. And what meaneth he by these wordes: He shall receyue an hundreth fold? Marry that for the externall, carnall, and temporall goodes which he hath lefte, he shall receyue the spirituall giftes of grace, and the giftes of the holy ghost, which are more then an hundreth folde better euen in this lyfe. And after also

shall receyue eternall lyfe, and the consumation of glorie. Wherefore (my welbeloued) if thou desyre to bee trulye, and spiritually enriched and enabled, contempne then (for the lou

If thou doe so, thou shalt become the Temple of the holy Ghost, &amp; the most blessed trinitie wil inhabit and replenish thy soule with all the aboundant delightes therof. For this is promised by y• sonne of God saying: If any man loue mée, he will kéepe my wordes and testimonyes, and my father will loue him, &amp; we will come vnto him, &amp; make our abode with him. O happie soule, in whom those thrée so plentiously do abide.

As our sauior saide vnto his Apostles in ye xiiij. Chapter of Iohn: I wil pray vnto my father for you, &amp; he shal giue you another spirit, euen y• holy ghost, whom ye world can not receyue. Whervppō Bernard sayth: The holy delectatiō doth decline him which is first occupied in seculer desires, &amp; suffreth him not to mingle vanitie with veritie, eternitie with frailtie, spiritualtie wt temporaltie, nor high things with low things. That thereby hée may learne what things moūt vpward toward heauen, and what things draw downwards toward earth. For if y• mind haue wherwith to be outwardly delighted, it remayneth inwardly without spiritual delight. And y• it is which Hierom doth so worthily say: If we cut from y• flesh such things as do most delight in, we sha
                     •…
                  straight straight way finde in ye spirit that which wil delight vs. If the outward wandring be shut vp, the inward accesse to God is opened, for the lesse y• the soule be dispersed in it self, the straighter it is erected to things aboue, by spiritual procéeding. And therfore to the end y• thou mayest (by y• brightnesse of y• holy ghost) holsomly behold that most noble worthinesse of those spiritual &amp; supernatural good things, set light by these temporal vanities, ye
                     •…
                   spurn from thée, &amp; vtterly forsake al y• is earthly. For as Bernard cōfesseth: They which are delighted in things y• are presēt, &amp; subiect vnto frailtie, can hardly or not at all behold &amp; cōtemplate things y• are heuēly &amp; eternal. But he which accompteth thē as dust or shadowes, shalbe ye soner raised vp in spirit to ye attaining of spiritual &amp; heauēly things. And herewtal since thou dost (my welbeloued) séem to be somwhat delighted in riches, honor, &amp; glory, therfore I dare not fully say vnto thée, y• thou shuldest make no maner accoūt therof. But mine admonitiō is, y• yu shuldest not ernestly nor hartily desire y• deceiuable riches, ye worldly honor, nor the glorie of men, but y• with thy whole harte thou séeke &amp; searche narowly for the spirituall treasure of vertue, the heauenly honor, &amp; the eternall glory.

And so shalt thou become a right riche man aboue all them that loue this world. For Hierome sayeth: those onely are to be accompted true ryches, which make vs aboundant in all vertues. And therfore if thou desire to be riche, then loue and imbrace the right riches of vertue. If thou aspyre vnto the height of honor, then make hast towardes the heauenly kingdom. And if thou couet a crowne of glorie or dignitie thē trauaile to be appointed &amp; enthroned amōgst ye Angels aboue. And this ment Gregorie whē he sayd: dispise worldly riches and thou shalt haue aboundance. Contempne worldly honor and thou shalt become glorious. Set light by ease &amp; corporal quyet in this lyfe, and thou shalte haue lyfe euerlastyng. Whosoeuer can learne to contempne him selfe, shall soone learne to dispise all things for God onely. And he that doeth so, may say with the holy Apostle. I haue lost all things (sayth he) to the end I might gayne Christ Iesus.
               The Prophet Esay in his seuenth Chapiter cryed out saying:Bicause God him selfe in proper person (enē Christ) did counsell vs, therefore we ought to dispise the world. This natiō or people is without wisdō or aduise: would God they could tast or vnderstand, &amp; would foresée the latter end. As also ye Philosophers rule is: Discentem oportet credere. A learner must beleue. And the Prophet also witnesseth: if we beleue not we shall not vnderstand. And Salomon in the fyrst of his Prouerbes sayeth: My sonne barken thou vnto the disciplyne of thy father. And in another scriptur

And agayne: let not the wordes of the elders passe by thine eares vnmarked, but stay thereat: and from the bottome of thy harte ioyne thée vnto the sayings of the wyse men. Then if héereby we bée taught to giue eare vnto wyse men, to beléeue their words, and to followe their counsell and aduice, is it not without all comparyson more expedyent that we giue eare, beleue, and obeye the on

                  ée also,

who peraduenture yet hast not obserued the holy precepts in all poyntes from thy youth bywardes. But thou wilt say: Can all men leade a perfecte lyfe? or forsake the world altogither? Oh this is a foolish obiecttion, and méete for fonde, worldly, and wicked men. Of whom Salomon sayeth: the number of fooles is infinyte. And the holy fathers haue answeared thys kynde of obiection at large.
               For there is great difference in iudgement betwéene that which is requyred to the conseruation and mayntenance of the first vndeuidable substance, and that which is requisite to the conseruation and mayntenance of the forme or lykenesse. But to remayne in the worlde, to doe and performe the acte of generation, and to till and manure the earthe is not requysite for the mayntenance of the fyrst vndiuydable substa
                     •…
                  ce, but for the mayntenance of our owne shadowe, shape, or lykenesse.
               And therefore let no man which findeth in him selfe any promptnesse or readinesse refuse that grace of God working in him and say: The worlde must not be altogither vnprouided or vnfurnyshed.
               For I pray thée tell mée, if thou shouldest altogither giue ouer the world, and giue thy selfe to a holy and solitarie life, should the world therfore fayle? Thinkest thou that for thée onely the earth shall be abandoned, or the rockes tranferred and moued out of their places? No no but doe thou gyue eare and follow the counsell of the most graue &amp; wise counsaylor, which is the Angell or messenger of the great counsell on highe. So that thou mayest safely defende thy selfe from infinyte perylles, and walke in a safer, shorter, quyetter, and more acceptable pathe, vntyll thou bée receyued into the resting place of the Lord thy God.
               Christ spake (as his Euangelist John rehearseth in theOf the cōtēpt of the worlde by the exāple of Christ. eight Chapiter) saying: I am the light of the worlde. He that followeth me walketh not in darkenesse: But shall haue the lyght of lyfe.

                   Leo did right Clerkely affyrme, saying: The

whole vyctorie of our Sauiour whereby hee ouercame both the worlde and the diuill, was begunne and finyshed in true humilitie.
               Furthermore as Bernard witnesseth, Christ did alwayes choose those things which were most greuous vnto 
                     •…
                  esh and bloud, and which did most declare hum
                     •…
                  tie. For he chose a poore mother, of whom he was contented to be borne in the middest of the colde winter, in the middest of darke night, in a strange place, and in a homely Cribbe. Whē he was borne he was wrapped in a fewe torne cloutes, and layde in the Oxe Maunger. Yea moreouer when of him selfe he was ryche and aboundant, or rather the verie true, highest, and omnipotent God, he became poore for our sakes. And so poore that he sayd: The birdes of the ayre haue their neasts, &amp; the Fores their dennes, but the sonne of man hath not where to hide his head. And how many persecutions he suffred &amp; enduredMath. 8. by the Jewes is sufficiētly testified by the Euangelists. For some saide vnto him: Hee hath a diuill, and the man isIohn. 10. madde. Some called him glutton, bibber of wine, and friendMath. 11. to the Publicans. Some sayd that by Bekebub chief prince of the diuils he cast out wicked spirites. Other sayde: How is this man from God, and we know that hee is a sinner. Will he kill him selfe. Sometymes they would stone him, some other whyles throwe him downe headlong, and at last they betrayed hym, and put him to a moste vyle kynde of death. But in all these thinges what dyd the innocent Lambe of God, the sonne of the euerlastyng Father? Forsooth hee was patient, hée restored good for euill, he spake wordes of saluation and health euen to the vnthankefull people, he prayed for them which crucifyed him, like a shéepe hee was ledde to the Slaughter, and he lay still and helde his peace lyke a Lambe in the Shéepshearers hands. WhenEsay. 54. he was most fal

                  y and wrongfully accused before PylateMark. 54. and Herode: hée answered not one word. He was made by GOD the father, obedyent euen vnto death. Hée made him selfe a sacrifyce and oblation for vs. Hee was

wounded for our offences. And therefore stretched out vpon the Crosse. Yea his hands and féete were pearced with hard nayles vntill all his bones might be numbred. And thus it was expedient that Christ should suffer and enter into hys glorie. Then if we desire to bee christians and of the number chosen to be saued, what remayneth for vs to doe? euen that we follow and imitate Christes pouertie, humilitie, and patience. That we chastise our owne bodies by the true fruites of repentance. That we crucifie our fleshe with all the vyces and concupiscenses thereof. That we make haste to walke in the narrow path with all feare and carefulnesse. That we be not ouercome with euyll, but let vs vanquishe the euill with goodnesse. Let vs not rendre euil for good vnto any man. Let vs not pampre and cherish our fleshe in myserable delights. Nor let vs geue place to any lightnesse, vanytie, or toyes. Whosoeuer can obserue these poyntes, he 
                     •…
                  yspyseth the world happyly, he ouer commeth himselfe laudably, and he learneth of Christ what it is to be méeke and humble of heart. For aboue all thinges we must founde all our conuersacion in true humylitie. Wherevpon Leo, spake grauely sayinge: All the dysciplyne of christyan lyfe doeth not consist in cunning wordes, in sharpenesse of wytte, in dysputacion, nor in vayne desyrs of glory and prayse, but in the true and voluntary humilitie which our Lorde and Sauiour Jesus Christ dyd choose and teache (as the stoutest kynde of defence) euen from the wombe of his mother vnto the deathe of the crosse.
               Whereby it appeareth also how trwe it is that Cypryan sayeth: All the lyfe of man, (if hée lyue lyke a chrystian, and according to the Gospell) is a crosse and a martyrdome. As also Chrysostome trwely sayeth: No man may well be termed a chrystian, vnlesse he be conformed vnto Chryst in maners and conuersacion. Wherefore (my beloued) if wée knowe that Jesus Christ is our sauiour and Lorde, let vs blushe and bée ashamed if wée bée not founde conformable vnto him.
               
                  Let vs be abashed to lyue, carnally, delycately, &amp; sūpteously. To ioy &amp; tryumphe in mens prayse &amp; fauour. To séeke cheifly our owne commodytie and preferment. And to walke puffed vp with a vayne and a proude hart. For our lyfe is in the myddest betwéene the Angels and Beastes. If we liue according to the fleshe, we are to be compared vnto Beastes. But if we lyue according to the spyrite, we are made fellowes with Angells. And if we yéeld to spyrituall sinnes and offences, as pryde, ambition, vayne glory, and wicked vanytie, we are now coopled vnto Diuills rather then vnto brute Beastes. Especially since that spirytuall vyces (speaking in Genere) are much greater and more gréeuous thē carnall vyces are. But wouldest thou knowe who were rightly to be termed a christian? He is truely a christian (sayth Augustine) which sheweth mercy to all men, which is not moued nor disquyeted with any iniurye, which féeleth another mās payne or greife as if it were his owne. Whose table is not shut from any poore or néedy. Which is accoumpted of small glory or estimatian before men, to the end he may be gloryfied before God and his Angells. Which dispyseth earthly thinges to obteyne heauenly. Which succoreth thée myserable and afflicted, and is moued to compassiō by other mens teares. Therefore let vs clense our selues from all blottes and blemyshes both of fleshe and spirite. And let vs imytate Christ our King by a wary and a frutefull lyfe, abhoring and despysing all wrath, all indignation, stoutenesse and fleshelynesse, that being altogither conuerted, we maye be made as little babes agayne.

And with whome soeuer thou knowest to kéepe the feare of God before his eyes, and whose soule is according vnto thyne in holynesse. For in this world a man falleth often, but ryseth seldome.

Furthermore since by Salomons wordes it séemeth: That we are ignoraunt whether we are yet worthy of the loue, or hatred of God, and that all thinges vncertayne are so reserued till the tyme to come, therfore we ought to be héedy and carefull before God, least we encurre the daunger of his infinyte wrath and euerlasting dampnation. To the avoyding wherof it is to be considered that certeyne sinnes &amp; vyces (namely of the fleshe) are the better avoyded and ouercome if a man doth estraunge and withdrawe himselfe from the materyall cause of the same. But how canst thou ouercome such vyces and their branches, if thou doe not flye from the materyall causes thereof? But dost dayly kéepe company with such as vnhappyly wallowe &amp; toumble in those enormyties, yea if thou doest become a fellowe vnto them, eating, drinking, and walking with them? For Hugo sayth: That it is vnpossible for any man t

And he that doth communycate with a proude man, shalbe endewed with pryde. Dothe it not folowe by the same reason that hée which

communycateth with a lecher shalbe defiled with lecherye? Augustine sayth: I beheld the Ceders of Lybanus. Whose fall I doubted euen asmuch as the rewyne of Hierusalem. And yet they both fell. To conclude I say in fewe wordes, that the more thou neclect the perylles of thy soule, the more thou prosperest in this world, the more delycately thou cherysh and tender that frayle fleshe of thyne, the more theu folowe the will of thy harte, the lesse thou regarde the losse of thy tyme, the more thou doe now glory, laugh, and wander in vanyties, so much the more myserable art thou, &amp; so much the more grééuously to be bewayled and pyttied. Yea y• lesse yt thou thy selfe bewayle thy blyndenesse, iniquity, and neglygence, so much the more th

                  u art of others to be bewayled &amp; pyttied. Wherefore (my welbeloued) rowse thy selfe from so many peryles and daungers. Flée from this world which is the enemye to thy soule, conuerte thy selfe wholy and perfectly to the Lord thy God, leaue and forsake (for his sake) all the goods and delights of this lyfe, and he will geue vnto thée all the treasures and abundaunces in the kingdome of heauen
               Our Sauiour sayth in the seuenth Chapiter of Mathew:The world is to be cōtempned because it is hard (therein) to attayne saluation. He which heareth the word of God and doth it not, is lyke vnto a foolyshe man which buylt his house vpon the sande. The floodes came and the wyndes blewe, and burst into yt house, &amp; the rewyne thereof was great. The holy fathers doe compare this world to a great and ragyng Sea, which is tossed with tempestes. And is passed with great daungers and many difficultyes.
               Agayne behold the Lorde GOD (with whome all thinges doe consist in an vnchangeable eternytie) as the highest thinge to be séene or beheld vpwardes. And the world it selfe as the lowest thynge downewardes. Then consider (saye they) lykewyse the mynde of man placed as it were in the myddest béetwene them both. The which (by the crcellence of manes condition) doth floate aboue the chaungeablenesse of this world and yet hath not attayned the vnchaungeablenesse

of the diuyne nature. Then if mans minde should chaunce through loue &amp; gréedy desire of these thinges which passe downwards, to drown it selfe therin, immediately it wilbe ouerthrowen with sundry waues, and beinge (as it were) deuided from it selfe, wil quickly be dyssipate and destroyed.
               But so much the easier it wilbe to gather it altogether on a heape &amp; to preserue it, if it rayse vp it selfe with an earnest thought and desire, forsaking those base and earthly places vntill at last it become altogither vnchaungeable by atteyning vnto that highest, &amp; most excelent immutabylity. Againe when a mans minde doth declyne downewardes by the loue which it hath to earthly thinges, it suffereth shipwracke in the floodes of this world. And being myxed or myngled amongest the changeable thinges, doth flowe away with the streame. Yea &amp; it is by a kynde of twofould daunger, tossed &amp; retossed. For both it is in perill to be drowned by ye déepe affection it beareth to the lower parts, and againe by contyne wall working of the waue in multytude of affections, it is meruelously dyssypate and dysseuered. But if it rayse it selfe vpwardes from the loue of this present lyfe by the desire that it hath vnto eternytie, and doe gather together all his thoughtes and cogitations, then doth it (as it were) swym alofte in the floode, and doth spurn and kycke awaye all traunsitory thinges as fylth or wéedes swymming lose in the water. Therefore let the mynde of man (as it were) so repose it selfe in safety, by raysing it selfe aboue and on it selfe towardes God and by retorning to it selfe, in it selfe, that by the considerations aforesayd it (béeing raysed aboue the world) maye behold the perylles a farre of and reioyse that it hath by any meanes eskaped them. And this it is to go into ye Arke of the hart and the spyrituall Shippe. By helpe whereof we maye happyly eskape the waues of this worlde wherewith we are tossed alwayes. Then spurne from thée and despyse these transitorye and frayle thinges, and behold thou arte swoome and eskaped

out of this great dyluge of roaring waters. Consider déepely and medytate the heauenly Sacraments of thy redemption, together with the benefytes of the diuine goodnesse bestowed vpon thée, and thou art alredy entred into the Arke of thy hart and the Shippe aforesayde. Againe this world is most conueniently compared vnto a large féelde full of crewell théeues and robbers. In the which many are kylled and murdered, and very few eskape at any tyme vnwounded or not sore hurt. Yea &amp; that which is worst, they which walke commonly in this field doe betray eche other into ye hands of those théeues. That is whilest one of them doth leade another into the fall of finne, whereby he falleth into the diuells handes. And thou (my welbeloued) if thou wouldest be afeard to walk in such a féelde replenished with théeues who might endaunger thée with temporall death, how darest thou then walke through this wycked worlde, wherein so many enemies are suborned by wycked spyryts, and so many stumbling blockes are layed to make thée fall into euerlasting fyre?
               Agayne this world is compared to a wood set on fyre wherof (in maner) all the trées are burnt and destroyed. For we maye dayly behold howe the loue and charytie of God is waxed colde in mens hartes, how the loue of the world hath preuayled, howe the fyre of concupyscence, the feruentnesse of pryde, and the flame of couetousnes are kyndled. In such sorte that (almost) euerye man séeketh to shyfte for himselfe. And neuer séeketh Christe Jesus nor those thinges which pertayne vnto his glorye. Men are carefull for worldly sustenaunce, and not for the purenesse of the soule, nor the cleanennesse of ye hart. Yea they doo rather séeke to avoyde the dyscōmodities of this present lyfe, then to eskape the bytter and eternall tormentes of hell fyre. And howe then darest thou chuse but be carefull how to eskape out of this woode? yea and that with spéede least thou be burned and consumed with the fyre of vyce &amp; lewdenesse? Lastly, it is compared vnto an olde Citie which for the mor

                   part is become ruinous, battred, &amp; destroyed. In such sort that

the enemyes may aproch and assault it on euery syde. So that it is now no safe dwelling therein. But we must flye vnto some stronger place of defence. For if we doo rightly consider our owne frayltie, how prone we are to euyll, and how slow to goodnesse, we shall fynde it requisite to séeke some safer resting place for our soules, wherein we may the better eschew and auoyde all occasions of sinnes.
               The princely Prophet in his foure and fortyth Psalme,The cōtemp

Although these wordes be lytterally to be expounded by the Church which is the vniuersall Spouse of Christ, yet may they also be vnderstoode by euery faythfull soule and mynde which is also the perticuler Spouse of Christ. For as Sainct Augustine sayth: euery soule is eyther the spouse of Christ, or the diuells concubyne. And therefore the holy Prophet saying: Forget thy people and thy fathers house, meaneth, despise these earthly thinges in respect of God and for his sake. Set asyde kynsmen, brethren, neyghbors, and all

For the more perfectly that thou contempne worldly thinges, so much the more thou shalt be replenyshed with heauenly treasure. As Gregory sayth: He doth very well withdraw his loue from the creatures, which doth onely with the eyes of his hart and vnderstanding, beholde the excedinge bright bewtie and louelynesse of the Creatour. So that (my deare and chrystian brother) if thou doo so, the kyng of kynges, the lorde of lordes, the onely begotten sonne of GOD, wyll earnestly desyre thy coomelynesse. That is, thyne inward coomelynesse, thyne inward reformation, the bryghtnesse of thy wysedome, and the feruentnesse of thy loue. And that shalbe sayed vnto thée which is wrytten, in the Cantycles: O my beloued how fayre and amyable thou art? yea he wyll lou

                  tely and aboundauntly. For in him the whole fulnesse of blessednesse doth consist. Yea the delight of God is to be with such a soule, and to d

                  cke and adorne it daily with great plenteousnesse, and to vysit and comfort it with most godly reioysinges. Then let vs (for gods sake) by the beholding of so great profit, and by the desyre and affection whiche we ought to haue vnto so greate nobylitie, learne to contempne euen from our hartes this moste vayne, varyable, néedye, frayle, &amp; intysing world, which with draweth vs from God. Synce it cannot satysfie nor cont
                     •…
                  t our affecte nor our desire. As Augustine 
                     〈◊〉
                   saying: A reasonable soule created to the lykenesse of God, maye be occupyed in all thinges, but it cannot be replenyshed, satysfied, nor fulfilled. For he which is capable of GOD, cannot be filled and satisfied with any thing that is lesse thē God. And agayne he sayth: O Lorde thou hast made 
                     •…
                  ur hart for thée, and it is therefore troubled &amp; out of quyet vntyll it maye come vnto thée. Nowe we haue shewed before sufficiently yt the more our soule is stretched out or d

                  spersed in earthly thinges, yea the more it be occupied in temporall thinges, and affected vnto worldly thinges, so much the lesse can it be occupyed, gathered together, or affected towardes God. And therefore if we would haue it incessauntly occupyed and exercysed in him by syncere contemplation, feruent loue, déepe medytation, contyne wall praier, harty prayse, and thankesgeuing, let vs withdrawe and turne it away from the world and all that is therein, and let vs wholy applye it, yea and as it were laye it flat and prostrate before the diuine maiestye. For so shall it wounderfully growe and increase in grace. And let vs so entirely loue and conserue this true godly and moste noble perfection, (which is beyond all comparyson better, more excelent, and more to bée desyred, then all the goods of

this world) that we may altogither and in euery respect, contempne the world (for the loue and desire which we haue to the said perfectiō) as a thing of nothing and altogither vayne. Neyther yet let vs thynke that we haue done anye greate thing to leaue and forsake earthly and base things for so supernaturall and excellent treasures, but let vs singe prayses vnto God with an humble and louely spirite bicause he hath so taught, illumynate, erected, and styrred vp our hartes to the true discerning, and full forsaking of all vanytie and vylenesse in this world. For they are truely blessed whome the Lord 
                     •…
                  oth so vouchsafe to teach, so to enduce vnto the contempt of the world, and so to rayse and styre vp vnto the full perfectiō of a spyrituall lyfe. Now (my welbeloued) should not he séeme to haue a mynde sore darkened, &amp; a hard hart, which hauing red, hard, and vnderstood these thinges, is neyther prouoked to contempne the world, nor enflamed to attayne the Godly perfection before rehearsed? Doe not thou then for the loue of the lesse, hazard to lose the more. Be not more delighted in creatures then in the creator. Doe not cleaue more earnestly vnto the world, then vnto God. For behold the world with all the concupyscence and vanytie thereof passeth away and vanysheth lyke smoke. But he which doth the will of God, shall abyde for euer.
               It is written in the seuenth Chapiter of Ecclesiastes remember thy latter ende, and thou shalt neuer sinnne.The cōtempt of the world by cōsideratiō of foure things at the latter day. And surely such as neyther the horrour of death, the trembling feare of Gods iudgemente, the bytter and euerlasting paynes of the infernall tormentes, nor the infinyte felicitye of the heauenly habitacion can prouoke or styre to walke warely, to amend theyr lyfe penitently, to feare GOD and to contempne the world: Are to be thought of a stony or rather a stéely hart and mynde. Especyally since we must beleue (nay rather we know perfectly) that we must once dye, and yet we are altogither ignoraunt when we shalbe called hence. Therewithall we must vnderstand y• after this lyfe ther is no tyme of conuersion nor repêtaunce.

And why doe we then ouerskype any 
                     〈◊〉
                   or occasion wherein we might doe well? Why doe we suffer an

when we lye downe to rest, let vs not presume of our vprysing. And by these meanes we shall easily brydle our selues from all vyce and worldly affection. Let vs well ponder that the houre approcheth wherein we shall remoue out of this lyfe into an vnknowen region. There immedytately to abyde before the trybunall seate of the most mighty and dreadfull indge. Then our tyme myspent and vnfruitfully lost will playnely appeare to be irrecuperable. Neither shall any thinge that we haue vnordynately loued or vniustly done here, be anye waye able to helpe or to comforte vs. Then shall we be sory that we haue lyued so carelesly, that we haue omytted so many good things, and cōmitted so many euils. But let vs now (whiles we haue tyme) shewe forth the true fruites of repentaunce. Let vs nowe so reuerence and honour Christ our iudge, that we may then be reuerently by him receyued. Let vs now be so sory and contryte for our sinnes, that we may then by Christ be eternally comforted.
               Agayne if wée doe well consider the stryctnesse of Gods iudgement, wée shall euen thereby learne vtterly to despyse all the vanyties of the world, and gréedily to runne to true repentaunce. For in the day of iudgement, the world shall stand in flamyng fyre, which shall burne and consume the wicked and reprobate. Christ shal be resident in the ayre.

                   saying: As often as I doe consider that daye, I doe shake and tremble on all partes. For whether (sayth he) I eate or drinke, or whatsoeuer I doe, the sounde of that most terryble troumpet doth alwayes thunder in myne eares saying: Ryse you that are deade and come vnto iudgement.
               And agayne he sayeth: When God the Lord shall come to iudge, the world shall pytiously roare and crye. One Tribe shall shocke and iustle agaynst another. The most mighty Prynces shall go bare and naked groping rounde about. Plato the foole shalbe brought in with his fonde Desciples. Aristotels fyne arguing shall not then preuayle. When the Sonne of that poore handycraftesman shall come to iudge the endes of the worlde. Then our sinnes shalbe on the ryghte hand, redye to accuse vs. On the lefte hande, an infynit number of wycked spyrites ready to take hold on vs. Underneth vs, the horrible masse or Chaos and confused heape of hell. Aboue vs, the heauens opened and rent in sunder. In the ayre, the angrey Iudge. Without, the world burning. Within the conscyence skalding ond skorching. Yea the iust man shall hardly be saued. Wo be vnto the wretched sinner so ouertaken. Whether shall hée flye? It shalbe impossible for him to lurke here and there, and it shalbe as vntollerable to appeare. The reprobate which are to be dampned séeing these thinges, shalbe troubled with a horryble feare, they shall mourne and languish for vexacion of spyrite and say: We haue erred from the waye of truth and the light of righteousnesse hath not shyned in vs. We haue ouerweryed our selues in the waye of iniquytie. Wherefore (my welbeloued) let vs learne and chuse (with the chosen of God) to abhorre the delightes of

the world, to bringe forth the true fruites of repentaunce, to serue God with dew reuerence, feare, and purenesse of hart, rather thē to encurre wylfully so great callamyties. For whosoeuer doth dyligently and profoundly reuolue &amp; ponder these paynes and tormentes of hell fyre, he shall vndoubtedly abhorre all sinne, all vanitie and prayse of this wicked world. For what a thinge is it to be for euer enclosed in the pryson of hell, in the myddest of vnquencheable fyre, in a moste fylthie stinckinge and lothesome lake, there to be vnspeake ably tormented, and with innumerable paynes to bée afflycted, without any least hope of deliuerie? For Gregorie sayth, there shalbe in hell vntollerable colde, vnquencheable fyre, a worme alwayes gnawing, a stynche alwayes smellynge, palpable darkenesse, the skourge euer stryking, the ougly spyrites alwayes gréeuing, the confusion of sinnes, the desperacion of all goodnesse, the hate and detestinge of all that is good and ryghteous, an vnremedyable turning backe from the highe heauenly maiestie, and an irecuperable turning towardes all euill and frayltie.
               For although in hell there be the prycke of payne and punyshement, yet there is no corection nor amendement of will and consent. Synce the reprobate shalbe so accused with their owne iniquinye, that righteousnesse neuerthelesse shall not by any meanes be of them embraced, loued, or desired. But what néede we to heape to gether somanye wordes of proofe of this matter? Doe thou thy selfe imagnne to behold (with the eyes of fayth and vnderstanding) a lake full of all myserie, yea most brymfull of all desperation, trouble, crying, and howlyng, boyling, with a most skalding fyre, and abundantly replenyshed with most sorowfull soules, and then consider what a thinge it were to be for euer gréeued and tormented therein to walke contynually in the blase of such flamyng fyres, to be racked and tormented vncessantly, and to be perpetually afflycted with the most horryble socyetie of the dampned, and the moste ougly faces and shapes of the Diuills? For this is it which in the

booke of Job is called the Tenebrous land ouerwhelmed with the thycke cloudes of death. The land of myseryes &amp; darkenesse, where the shadow of death, and no order, but perpetuall horrur doth enhabyt. For ouer and besides other infinit paynes of hell, there is also troublesome, paynefull, and vnestymable dysorder cōtineually. Then doe not they séeme vnto ye most vnhappy, yea more then thryse and foure times most vnhappy, who for these most short and transitory lyberties, vnlawfull delyghtes, worldly vanyties, frayle affections, rytches or prosperytie, doe fall into such an vnspeakeable myserie which shall endure for euer? Wherefore let vs come forth &amp; forsake this broade &amp; opē way of these worldlynges leading vnto destruction and vnhappinesse, and let vs embrace and followe the streyght waye, lyuing fruitefully, fearefully, &amp; reuerently before y• Maiesty of the highest God.
               Yt is written in the lxxxiii. Psalm: How louely &amp; delightfullThe glorye of the blessed is a principall meane to make vs to contempne this world. are thy Tabernacles O Lord god of vertues? my soule doth eagerly desire and faynte in the Court of God. And as the doctors and Fathers of the Church haue agréed, the loue and charytie of God is the lyfe of the soule. So that without loue and charytie, nothing is pleasing, nor acceptable before God. Neither can it profite any thing at all towards the obteyning of the heauenly felycitie. Then all our actions, our thoughts, affections, speaking, doing, or suffering, cannot be acceptable in the sight of God, vnlesse it procéede from charytie, eyther by way of allurement, by way of commaundement, or by way of direction. Wherevpon it foloweth that such as doe bewayle, confesse, and repent, their misdéedes onely for feare of payne, for seruyle dreade, they doe not therefore obtayne forgeuenesse. For euery good déede, ought to be done for the zeale of iustice and righteousnesse, and for Godly charytie, but not for feare. Thereof the Apostle saied: If I speake with the tonges of Angels and of men, and yet haue not charytie in mée, it shall nothinge profit mée. For thē doe wée chiefly performe our dutyes when wée reuerence GOD not onely for feare, but also

for the sure trust and confidence that we haue in his loue. And when zealous affection, (not dreade) doth rayse vs vpwards to doe that is good. By this dread is vnderstoode and ment the seruyle feare which onely and principally dothe respect the punishment and correction. Of the which sainct Iohn sayeth: There is no feare in perfect charitie. Then si
                     •…
                  ce we might be enduced (as hath béen beforesayde) to the contempt of this world by the consideracion of death, iudgement, &amp; the paines of hell, yet ought we much more &amp; by much stronger reason to be enduced therevnto by the consideracion contemplacion and loue of the perpetuall blessednesse &amp; glory of the chosen. The which is of a certayne infinit dignitie, since it is an immedyate frewition of that vnmeasurable, good, holy, and glorious God. Wherefore as this frewition is altogether supernaturall, we can neuer atteyne therevnto but by supernaturall meanes. As thankeful thanksgeuing, Fayth, Hope, Charitie, &amp; the other gyftes of the holy Ghost. And the more perfectly and plenteously that these meanes doo dwel &amp; abyde in vs, so much the more vehemently we despise all worldly &amp; temporal things &amp; plainly perceue their, vanitie, vylenesse, &amp; doo Yea we doo so much ye faster, more affectionately, more abundātly, more swyftly &amp; vncessantly, aspyre, go forewards, approch, or rather runne outryght towards y• blessednesse of the heauenly Paradyse &amp; habitacion Embrasing &amp; executing all the helpe, fauour, &amp; assystance of gods holy spirit more redyly and more chearefully. Wherefore let vs be moued (by the desire of the felicitie and glory of the

Let vs quickly &amp; out of hande forsake the worlde, yea lette vs accompt all the fraylties thereof to be as dyrt and doonge. For as Augustine dooth well testifie: The bewtie of ryghteousnesse, and the pleasantnesse of theternall lyght, are such and so greate, that although a man myght therein remayne but one onely houre in a daye, yet euen for that small space vnnumerable yeares of thys lyfe béeinge full of delyghtes and flowing

Wherefore (my welbeloued) prepare thy selfe and marke narowly what a great felicitie the blessed inioy, and what exceedyng delight it is to see God playnely▪ and distinctly. For the fayrer that any thing is, doe we not accompt it also the more delectable to behold it playnly and perfectly? Since God then of him selfe is essentially, totally, and vndescribably, fayre, holy, pure, and bright

For the better, swéeter, and perfecter that any thing is in it selfe, the more delightfull and pleasaunt the fruition therof must be. But our Lord God being omnipotent, onely to bée adored, happie, and (of him selfe) most excelent pure, vndescribable, and incomprehensible goodnesse, that infinite swéetenesse, that so perfecte Being, that whatsoeuer pertayneth to the fulnesse, worthinesse,Ens. and pr

For the obtayning whereof, all the ioyes, honors, prayses, and prosperities of this worlde, are infinitely and with excéedyng lothsomenesse to be dispysed. Then consider in such sorte as thou mayest, what ioy it would be to sée and behelde the eternall being of his diuyne maiestie. How it is and hath bene from the beginning of it

Agayn to be so excéedingly illustrate with the godly wisdome, &amp; so abundantly replenished with the diuine goodnesse, that all thy capacitie, vnderstading, and all thy desire, might therwith be throughly filled &amp; satisfied. Yea furthermore, consider what excéeding pleasure it would be to taste the swéetnesse of godly peace and tranquilitie, to be euen swallowed vp in the loue of thy creator, to be transformed into God, to be made perfectly lyke vnto him, to imbrace him louingly in him selfe, in such sorte that thou coul

So that the chosen shall reioyse in them selues at the sight and vision of God, in themselues they shall reioyce in the beautye and comelinesse of their heauenly bodies, and the bodyes of their corporal creatures,

In the which there is to be found the affluence of ryches, the influence of delightes, and the confuence of all good thinges. Wherefore (my welbeloued) let thy soule bée inflamed with the desyre of thys blessednesse.
               For it, let all thy good actions bee exercysed effectuallye, and let thy mynde medytate therevpon customarily. Doe not subiecte thy selfe to the peryll of loosing thys glorie, for the worlde and vanities thereof. For finally, it reteyneth so great grace in thys lyfe, and so great glorie in the worlde to come, that though wee were sure that wee might inioye them in thys worlde, yet for the loue of increasing and profityng therein, wée shoulde worthily leaue and forsake all thinges for God. Who of hys great clemencye gyue thée vnderstandyng to taste and perceyue these thyngs perfectly, and to harken and obeye vnto good and godly counsell. For the iudgements of the Lord our God are incomprehensible &amp; very dreadfull. And where he powreth his grace into one &amp; not into another, that (as Augustine sayeth) is for some hydden cause, but for none vniustnesse in GOD. But I shall

dayly beseche God in y• bowels of Jesus Christ, that he will make merueylous his mercies in thee euery kynde of way.
               Salomon vseth these wordes in the xx. Chapter of Ecclesiastes.The disquiet labour and troubles of this worlde enduce the contempt of the shame. God hath giuen wisdome, knowledge, and reioysing to the man that is good, and to the sinner, affliction, &amp; superfluous care. We haue alreadie treated suffitiently of the contempt of this world, as well on Gods behalfe as on our owne. Now then it shall not be amisse to speake thereof by regard of the world it selfe, the which if it be well considered, it conteineth in it selfe whereby to be contempned and dispised. And first this one thing commeth to memorie, that the louers of this world are tossed and retossed with sundry troubles, disquiettes, afflictions and labors, in such sorte that it ministreth more payne and bytternesse then delight and quietnesse in all things whereof men hope to haue consolation. For whilest they are withdrawen or turned back from the highest and most simple goodnesse, (in whom onely true peace, and true ioy doe abound) they disperse them selues in temporall and earthly things. And being not perfectly established in any one thing, they are caryed about vniuersally. Whereby they are affected with manifolde passions and thoughtes, as now with delight, then with dollor, now with loue, then with hate, now with desire, then with disdayne, now with longing, and then with loathing. For they haue not the skill to bring things vnto an equall measure by the iudgement of reason and discretion, nor to be in a kynde of tranquilitie in euerie occurrent, but (lyke vnto bruit beastes) they follow the force and sway of their pangs and passions, accordyng to the impulsiue motion of their sensualities and lustes. Whereby it falleth out most commonly that they neuer continue long in one disposition. And besides these considerations (accordyng to the Philosophers opinion) a man which delighteth in contemplation and speculation, hath (in him selfe) sufficient matter and cause of good delight. Synce he is filled with speculation, and reioyseth in heauenly considerations, (that is to say) in scientiall and sapientiall points

of knowledge, in the which he is spiritually delighted. Neither doeth he séeke or require delightes in sensuall things out of him selfe. But the vnlearned, the carnall, and worldly men doe not taste any such delight, neither haue they sincerely the matter or materiall cause of delight and contentation within them selues. Therefore they séeke to reioyce in outward things wherein they stumble (not alwayes vpon pleasaunt and prosperous successe but) oftentimes vpon hard and ouerthwarte accydentes, which makes them most commonly to endure griefe and disquyet of mynde. And by good reason should that man which is deuout and spirituall, contayne in him selfe wherewith to be spiritually delighted in God, yea euen in aduersitie. But the worldlings and the vytious men haue now wrath, then sadnesse, now enuy, thē indignation, &amp; sometymes sodayne feare (which be most painefull and bitter passions) whereby they doe not onely wound and weaken their soule, but many tymes also they fret their mynde and waste their corporall strength. For somewhiles they are (as it were) resolued into vayne myrth, puffed vp with vayn hope, &amp; stretched out into vayn desures, &amp; straight wayes agayne they reioyce in that which ought to make thē sadde, and ware sorowfull for that which might giue them greater cause of comforte, gaping for that which were to bée s

desires. Neyther is there any thyng more quyet then to couette or desyre nothyng. But the spirituall ryches (saith hée) are loathed when they are not yet had nor possessed, and that is of suche as haue not yet tryed them. Whych may peraduenture bee a cause (my welbeloued) that thou arte the lesse allured and entysed vnto the diuyne, sacred, and most sincere delyghtes of spirituall conuersation, and that thou makest the lesse haste therevntoo, bycause thou haste not (as I gesse) yet tryed them. But giue eare vnto thys holy father Gregorie, make haste, yea post hast, to attayne vnto a perfecte spyrytuall lyfe, leauyng the worlde and all the concupiscences thereof.
               And I hope that thou shalte taste howe swéete the Lorde is, for greate is the multitude of his delectablenesse.
               And thou shalte bée delyghted in the multytude of Christ1. Pet. 2. hys peace, the which passeth all sences and vnderstandings, and whych the worldlynges can not taste. Bycause as thePsal. 30. Prophette witnesseth: There is no peace vnto the wicked sayeth the Lord God.
               And to conclude, accordyng to the olde Prouerbe, who is so honoured, that hée is not sometymes troubled? who is in suche estymation, that hee is not also sometymes in trybulation? And who sitteth on hyghe that is not subiecte vnto vanytye. And as Gregorie sayeth: The more that anye man is extolled wyth honour and dygnytye, the more is hée loaden with gréeuous burthens.
               And all thynges that héere doe excell, are more vexed with griefe then they are reioysed wyth honour, and more dooth the fall of dampnation threaten and affrighte them, then theyr hope to attayne euerlastyng blessednesse can recomforte them. For mercy is graunted to those which séeme of least dignitie. Whilest they y• are mightie suffer therewith mightie torments. For iudgemēt shalbe most gréeuous vnto thē which bear greatest aucthoritie, &amp; haue greatest prehemynēce. And thervpon Chrisostom sayd: who desireth to entrude him self into spiritual promotiōs, or to take charge of soules.

but suche an one as feareth not Gods iudgement? it is a great securitie of mynde and quyet of conscience, to reteyne nothing that hath in it any seculer concupiscense. Yea and it is a vyle and miserable bondage, to be altogither troubled in worldly affayres, and to leaue God forgotten Although vnto many worldly men it seemeth gréeuous to be occupyed or cō
                  uersant in any thing els then priuate profit, which haue not the skill or vnderstandyng howe to occupie them selues in holy &amp; vertuous actions. And the soule of man is suche that without loue and some what to be exercised on, it can not cō
                  tinue. So that the lesse it be occupyed and affected obout god, so muche the more it is powred out and bestowed in vayne and earthly things. Agayne Bernard sayeth: the insatiable loue of riches doth much more torment men with desire, thē the vse therof can recomfort them when they haue obteined it. For there is labor and payne in gettyng of them, feare and dread in possessing them, and much sorow and griefe in forgoing them. Yea golde doth most gréeue him which hath greatest aboundance thereof.

And let such reioyse in temporall things as haue not the skil to desire heauenly and euerlasting treasures.
               It is written in the holy word of God: Watche you (forThe losse of tyme or misspending of spirituall pro fits, enduce the contempt of the world. you know not when the Lord commeth, ouer night, at mydnight, or in the gray morning) least whē he commeth sodeynly he fynde you sléepyng.

And therevpon Chryst sayed: How hard it isMark. 10. for them that are ryche to enter into the kingedome of God? For ryches being ones possessed, are very hardly despysed. And earthely thinges (beinge ones gotten) are more stryctly beloued, then they are coueted before they be had. So that they which altogither apply the multiplyinge of ryches, doo neclect to séeke the ioyes of the worlde to come.

               To conclude, how much more the louers of this world doo forgett GOD, euen so much the more also are they of him abandoned and forsaken, and so much the more theyr harts shalbe hardened. Wherevpon it oftentymes happeneth that they loue nothinge effectually which pertey

                  eth vnto God. They couet not heauenly thinges, but (for the most parte now a dayes) the worse that men become, the more carelesse yet they are. And whiles they neuer looke vp to sée from whence they be fallen, nor feare the punishmentes to come, they waxe ignoraunt how much they are to be lamented.

                  e that the present glorie is nothing at all. But he which fyxeth his harte in things present, neuer weying nor consideryng the punyshmentes to come for the wicked, but is puffed vp with false ryches, and reioyseth when he hath more cause to be lamented, he is subiecte vnto many mischiefes. Synce there can be no truer nor ryghter myserie, then false and vayne tryumphyng. Yea and euerye man doeth so much the more outwardly reioyce, as hée doth inwardly the lesse remember him selfe. These sentences before alleaged I haue gathered out of Gregorie, wherby thou mayest playnely perceyue how perillous a thyng it is (especially for suche as professe reformation) to apply our affections vnto these earthly things. But peraduenture thou doest purpose to vse ryches without abuse, and to bee conuersaunt amongest worldlyngs, but not worldly and wantonly, and to eate and drynke amongest them without ryotte or banquettyng. And fynally to vse the fauour and honour of men without tryumphyng or glorying therein.
               Surely if thou couldest performe this, it were a great perfection. But hardly can the best and most perfect continue therein. And howe seldome it is séene, marke thy selfe by these wordes of Gregorius: It is commonly sée

The ryche man is ouercome with excesse of delight, and becommeth vnbrydeled in boastyng wordes. Hée runneth where hee lusteth, and falleth into all vnlawfull things. Yea those thinges which were the occasions and allurementes of hys vyces, doe become the instruments of hys payne and punyshment.

Yea euen whylest I yet began, he cut mée off. And Iob: remember mée O Lord, for my lyfe is lykeIob. 7. a puffe of wynde.

For as Augustyne affyrmeth: If Adam yet lyued, and shoulde dye thys day, what coulde it then auayle hym to haue liued so long?

Or what hath our pompe and boastyng preuayled vs? All those thyngs haue passed ouer as a shadowe, and as a swyfte running messenger.
               For then shall the heauens reneale the vanitie of the louers of this world togither with their iniquities, and the earth it selfe shall ryse agaynst them. Then their sin and transgression shal be manifest with suche as haue sayde to God: Departe from vs. Wee will not haue the knowledge of thy wayes. Then shall the rounde world fight agaynst them in Gods behalfe. All thynges which haue bene shall then suffer punyshement, and yet shall not be consumed. Yea they shall suffer and sustayne accordyng to the multitude of theyr

inuentions. For the wicked is reserued vntyll the daye of perdition, and shall bee ledde vnto the day of furie, and shal drinke of the wrath of the almightie. Let these things ter

But all thinges passe ouer, and all things flye away. This day is paste, and the beginnyng of the nexte is not yet knowne whither it shall be quyet or laboursome.
               For so passeth ouer the glorie of this worlde. And ther vpon Augustyne demaundeth saying: What wilte thou loue temporall things (sayeth he) and passe away with them, or wilt thou loue Christ and lyue eternally with hym? For it is vnpossible that a man doe both inioy the present delights and the ioyes to come. It is vnpossible both héere to fyll the paunche, and there to satis

Yea and the contempte of worldely and temporall thynges is euydente by this that God doeth oftentymes bestowe them more aboundantlye vpon hys enimyes and them which are reprobate, then vpon the electe. For the electe doeth consider (by the end) that those thinges are of none accompte which doe transitorilye and seculerly delyght. And therefore Hierome sayeth: the spéedie cons

And therein what is not frayle? What is not transitory? What is not changeable? What is not sinallye full of perylles by the whiche you passe on vnto greater yea and euerlasting perylles. And of the vanytie of the worldly lyfe Hierome sayth: O lyfe (no lyfe but) death. A deceiptfull lyfe, laden with sorowe, weake, and ouershadowed. New it florysheth, streyght waye it wythereth.

                  In the first Epistle of Iohn and the fyft Chapiter, it isThe mallice and cōtinuall hurt which the world she weth to the louers therof may cause vs to contempne it. written: All the whole world is set on wyckednesse. Yea is not the world subiect vnto the Diuill, and replenished with all iniquitie? Wherevpon the same Iohn in his seconde Chapiter of his second Epistle sayth: All that is in this world, is concupiscence of the fleshe, concupiscence of thinges séene, or pryde of lyfe and conuersacion. And as Peter sayth: The wycked are seruauntes of corruption and2. Pet. 2. of sinne. For of whome soeuer a man be maystred or ouercome, vnto him he is a seruaunt and in bondage. And hée which is the bondman of sinne, is consequently the seruant of the Diuyll. Wherevpon Paule speaketh of the wicked2. Tim. 2. saying: Let them turne backe from the snares of the Diuill, by whome they are holden in captyuitie euen according to his pleasure. And Christ in his gospell doth terme the diuill the Prynce of this world. Meaning not the rounde globe of the sphere, but the worldly creatures which being turned backe from God, are ouerwhelmed and buryed in earthly thinges. Of whome Hierome ment saying: Going backe frome the Lord, they are written and regystred in the earth. But Christ sayth contrariwyse to the electe, reioyce and be ioyefull. For your names are writtē &amp; regestred in heauen. Now Beda expoundeth these wordes thus: By the worlde and those thinges which are therern, he vnderstandeth men which inordynately and excessyuely doe loue and estéeme the world. And such haue nothing but concupyscence of the flesh concupyscence of thinges sene with eye, and pryde of lyfe. For in these vocables and proper names of vyces, Iohn doth comprehende and enclude all kynds of vyces. For the concupyscence of the fleshe, is all that pertayneth vnto the volupteousnesse and delyghtes of the bodye. By the concupyscence of thynges séene with the eye, are ment all curyosyties which are commytted in learninge of wycked artes and ornamentes, all contemplacion of filthy and wycked sightes or spectacles, all superfluous desyre to get temporall and tryflinge toyes, and all curyous carpynge

and marking of our neighbours imperfections. By the pride of lyfe and conuersation, is ment the pompe and beast which men conceiue in worldly promotions. So that the world is replenyshed with Diuils. For what els doe men that liue according to the world but stryue to wrappe and enfuolde themselues in sundrye sortes of sinnes? Yea and to wound and wearye theyr soules, with the maynes of myschiefes, and the shaftes of sundrye shamefull concupyscences, vntill at last they féele not theyr owne harmes? We sée fulfilledOse. 4. in the Church that which is written by the Prophet: There is no truth, there is no mercy, there is no knowledge of God on the earth. The cursed vyces of murder, thefte,Hier. 6. adulterye, and lying, are come flowing ouer vs. From the greatest to the least, all men applye themselues vnto couetousnesse. The Pryestes haue not sayd, where is y• Lord, and the pastors haue vsed collusion.

But if christyās did lyue now as they lyued in the primityue church and first comminge of the Gospell there should be no suche greate necessytie to flye from the world. Marye as men doe now a dayes (for the most parte) lyue, it is a highe dyfficulltye to lyue well, or to declyne from heynous sinnes in ye world. Especially for such as are not exercysed with verteous quallytie or paynefull labour, but doe abounde in ryches and are conuersant in greatest pompes and highest places. Deceiptes, ambytion, enuye, volupteousnesse, and all other euils are powred out vpon the earth. Euery man beateth his brayne howe hée maye multyplye and encrease his substaunce, but no man careth howe to saue hys soule. Men are afeard least they should fall into pouertye, but were it not muche more to bée feared to lyght into the bottomelesse pyt of hell? The world is the fornace of vyces. The which these worldlings doo heate and warme with the fuell of sinne.

For they are so much blynded, that they neither sée nor feare the peryles which are notoryous and well knowen to all men. But doe tryumph and reioise in theyr euils lyke phrentyke and made men. Yea if there be any whome they sée not wrapped in lyke wooes, they accoumpt them to be blockyshe and senseles creatures. Well sayd that Phylosopher: As often as I was amongst men, I retornedSen

To conclude euen as the people of Israell could not depart from Egypt without the helpe of thy diuine Maiestie, euen so no man cā be pulled or withdrawen from this world, vnlesse he be helped with the fynger and power of the heauenly hande. YetExo. 12. shall there neuer be founde any defect in God, so that man will doe his best that he maye. Agayne the world is compared to a deserte by the which the chyldren of Israell went from Egipt vnto the land of promisse. And in this desert they met so many letts and impedyments, that of thréeskoreDeut. 2. thowsand numbred, onely two (euen Caleph and Iosue) were brought into the land of promyse. O how the Diuils doth reioyse to sée them all now in the synke and filthynesse of their sinnes. Men cleaue vnto worldly thinges, and in worldly thinges they are wyse, but they neyther care for God nor for his commaundementes, neyther are they astonyed when they heare his moste terryble iudgementes. But they accompt them as fables. Oh all thinges that are, be euill bestowed vpon vs. For our hardnesse is neuer moll

                  ed. But thinke we that God will omyt his iudgement? Or leaue these sinnes vnrewarded? Or suffer the wordes which he hath spoken of the iudgement to come and of the euerlasting paynes, to be falsified? God forbyd that we should so thynke. Furthermore whosoeuer is ouercome with the loue of earthly thinges, he is not delyghted in God. But no man can long abyde without some delectation.

And therefore such as are not delighted in spyrituall things, doe powre themselues out vnto worldly solace. And so consequently are ouerwhelmed in the multytude of sinnes and vyces. Wherevpon Saint Augustine sayth: Blessed is he O Lord which loueth thée. For he which loueth not thee, loueth the world, is seruaunt and bounde vnto sinne, he is neuer quyet, neuer in safetie, but is dystracte and dyspersed in the varyable cares, vanityes, and pompes, of the world. And whosoeuer doth contempne the volupteousnesse of this world, and thereby eskaye the snares of the Diuill, shalbe most happy in that his soule is delighted in such thinges, as cannot be blotted or defiled with any vncleannesse, but is immediately clensed &amp; purged with ye cleannesse of truth. And synce y• lawe of God doth so delight him y• he shalbe able ther by to avoyde &amp; eschew y• delightes of y• world. But as longe as we delight in the deceyptfull tast of iniquity, so long we shall thinke it most sower and bytter to faste of equitie. And to whome the world séemeth swéete &amp; sauorye to him Christ séemeth bytter and sower. Yet hauing tasted the spyrite of God, all fleshe shall (as it were) dote and playe the foole. Agayne whosoeuer doeth with his whole mynde serue and please this world, is thereby enfected with a manyfold deformytie of vyces. And he which tasteth nothing of the heauenly swéetenesse, will not be afeared to be polluted with earthly desires. But if such as for the loue of God despyse the world, kéepyng themselues contyneually conuersant in spyrytuall thinges, cannot yet he altogither pure and clensed from sinnes, with how heauy burdens of vyces are the

with, and longe suffer such as he attendeth to repent and conuerte, yet if they doe not conuert, he doth the more greuously punyshe and detest them. And that which the Prophet sayeth of the contrytion and sorowe of a sinner, must be vnderstood of true contrytion and harty repentaunce. But the true contrycion doth procéede of the true faith and loue of God, and of the lothing of sinne, and an affection vnto righteousnesse.
               Yea and as Hierome testyfieth: Repentaunce and harty contrytion are necessarye.
               Wherevnto that saying of Chrisostome agréeeth: Compunction is the thing whiche maketh purple séeme vyle, maketh men desire hearecloth, loue teares, and eschewe company.

Or (peraduenture) if he hoped of longer lyfe, he would deferre it? Surely it séemeth doubtfull that through seruyle feare and constrayned fayth, his contrycion procéedeth by the onely beholdyng of his owne onely refuge. And that it is not true contrycion, but a terryfing of the spyrite. But he which will soundly and perfectly repent, must first be sorye for his faulte, bicause it is filthy transgression and offensyue vnto GOD. Yea and a dyshonour vnto the diuine sanctitye and Maiestie. Wée reade in the Machabes: That Antyochus dyd repent, and yet obteyned not mercy. The Apostle doth wryte the lyke of Esau: He found not2. Mac. 9. (sayeth he) place for repentaunce, although he sought it wyth teares. Therefore let no man deceyue hymselfeHeb. 12. wyth vayne hope or solyshe perswasyones. For as Hierome sayeth: This I hold for certayne and doe thynke moste true, that hée hath no good ende which ledde alwayes an euyll lyfe. Which being sound and in health, was not affeard to offend god, but wallowed and toumbled

in the vanityes of the world. The death of Saintes is most pretious in the sight of the Lorde, but the death of sinners is most abhomynable. The sinner shalbe persecuted with this reuenge, that dying he shall forget himselfe, and both lyuing and dying he forgat God As. Augustine confirmeth saying: He cannot dye euill, which lyued well. Nay skarce can he dye well, which lyued euyll. And yet wée must not dispayre of any sinner. But they are to be exhorted and styred to repentaunce euen in the last gaspes. For some tymes percase it happeneth (although very seldome) that he which in tyme of health did neglect repentaunce, shall yet by repenting then obteyne mercy. But he is a most arogant foole which passinge ouer his lyse in health doth put his soules health vnto that ploonge of peryll. But let vs doe that which is more sure and sase. That is to repent and amende whyles we be sounde and in health, praying most faythfully with the Prophet: Cast me not out (O Lorde) in myne age, and leaue me not nor forsake me not,Psal. 70. when my strength and power fayle me. For beholde saythe the Apostle, Now is the acceptable time, &amp; now are the daies1. Cor. 5. of health.
               Who is this rysing as the daye rose (sayeth the princelyThe excelency of the soule conformed to God, and the vylenesse of the sinfull soule.

Neyther can that lykenesse playnely represent the thinge, vnlesse it be made equall vnto the thinge it selfe.

               Furthermore this vision is more then most worthy and altogether supernaturall, the which all the chéefe Phylosophers dyd thinke impossible to be put in any mynde created, no not in theyr separate substaunces. So that to obtayne the same, we haue néede of many supernaturall gyftes, meanes, and helpes,. As first that there may be geuen vs from God a blessing euen grace making vs gratefull and acceptable, the which doth bedecke and adorne perfectly the very essence or being of the intellectuall and reasonable nature. And maketh vs fyt to deserue eternall lyfe, and to be conioyned vnto the supernaturall diuinytie. Furthermore the loue and charytie whereby god &amp; the first being, or essence, is loued, is spirytually, supernaturally, purely, fréely, and fully distylled into vs from the holy Ghost. And with it, hope and fayth also. This charytie and loue doth (as it were) counterpayze him that hath it, with the loue of the whole vnyuersallitie. So that yet it maketh him loue God more then all thinges that euer were created. Yea the least dram of this loue and charytie doth make God to be loued aboue the whole world. And otherwyse man should not be in state of Saluation.
               For according to the holy Fathers, whosoeuer hath thys charitie and the grace before rehearsed, he hath also the giftes of the holy ghost, and all the other vertues conuected vnto charytie and conioyned vnto perfect grace. Yea the more he profiteth in this grace and charytie, so much the higher doeth he growe in good gyftes and vertues.
               To conclude, the excelencie and worthynesse of these supernaturall good thinges is suche and so greate, that it can hardly be comprehended or expressed.
               
                  For no naturall perfection, no bewtie, no coomlynesse, nor no bryght shyninge lyght, can be thought equall vnto it. No the heauenly lyghts doo not so much, nor so well adorne and

                  e wtifie the substaunce of the Sunne and Moone, as those graces doe bewtifie and adorne the substance and beinge of the soule. Neyther doothe the Sunne so much bewtifie the heauenly Fyrmament, as Charitie dothe bewtifye the Soule.
               No the seuen Planettes doe not so muche adorne the heauenly Spheres or Cyrcles, as the gyftes of the holy ghoste dooe adorne and bedecke the powers of the soule. The vnyuersallytie of the Starres dothe not so muche adorne and set foorth the eighth Sphere or Fyrmament, as the vniuersallytie of verteous actions dothe dignifie, adorne, and perfect, the Soule. For euen as by the Philosophers opinion, true felicitie consisteth rather in action, then in outwarde forme, euen so in diuinitie also more vertue and perfection consisteth in exercise of godly actions, then in profession or aparaunce. And the more noble that the outwarde aparaunce be, the more noble should the action and execucion be also. Therefore since the forenamed gyftes and treasures of grace, be habytes or outward tokens of so great highnes and excelence, doth not the christian soule séeme vnto thée to be most noble, gallaunt, and godlyke, which is occupyed continually in the exercyse of those habytes, and which is so spiritually, supernaturally, and godly conuersant? yea which doth so perfectly worship and reuerence God, whose conuersacion is altogether in heauen? For surely here vpon it hath bene wrytten, that such a soule: is the daughter, the beloued, and the spowse of God, priuie to his heauenly secretes, most familiar with him, conformable in affectiōs, and the entyrely beloued heyre of God, the coheyre with Christ, which beholding gods glory with face dyscouered, is trāsformed into the same likenesse, from one brightnes to another. For asmuch as it lotheth all worldly, frayle, carnal, &amp; humaine sollaces, all prayses, honors, &amp; seculer pompes, &amp; all that dyspleaseth

God. But whatsoeuer it knoweth may please God, that doth it with all earnest affection embrase. To conclude, euen as by the Philosophers traditions euery motion hath his dignitie, name, &amp; prospertie from the ende wherevnto it tendeth, euenTerminus ad qué. so the action is dignified by the worthinesse of the obiect and matter about the which it is occupyed. Then how great is the dignitie &amp; glory of that soule, whose mocion and action,Circa quem. lyfe, and whole entent, are continually occupyed about the highest God? and is termyned in him who is most certeyn

The which beinge by deadly sinne turned and withdrawen from God, is spiritually deade, and doth nothing acceptable vnto God, nor profitable towardes the atteyninge of euerlasting lyfe. It preferreth these transitorie, sensible, worldly, &amp; most vile things which seeme good, before y• highest, eternal, most perfect, infinite, &amp; vnchangeable true God, beinge omnipotent, and more then most glorious aboue all other. Wherby it doth highly dishonor God. Yea it proposeth vnto it selfe an ende and terminacion in frayle and vayne thinges.

                     •…
                  ges, vanyties, and vyces, we are made most vnlyke vnto him. For simylitude and lykenesse are cause of loue, as dissimilytude and vnlykenesse are cause of rancor and hatred. Yea the perfection of any creature (especially of a reasonable and intellectuall mynde) is to be proportionately made lyke vnto his creator. Then the more lofty that we become through vertue, so much the lyker and better beloued we are vnto God. Yea so much the fayrer and more comely we are inwardly adorned. But the more that we sinne, the more vnlyke, odyble, and ilfauored we séeme vnto our God. Which out of all doubt is a most myserable and vnworthy thing. Therefore we sée there is greate difference betwene ye vertuous and vytious soules. And as by the Phylosophers opinion, a man which spendeth his tyme in contemplation is most pleasing vnto the gods, euen so by the same doctryne, a man which giueth himselfe vnto vyces, and naughtynesse, is tenne thousand tymes more abhomynable then the brute Beastes. As may also playnely appeare by the diuersitie of theyr rewards. For god doth place and constytute the vertuous, in the firie heauen, giuing himselfe vnto him for reward, &amp; communicating all thinges vnto him by an immediate &amp; most blessed kinde of vnion with him himselfe. But he dothe put from him the vycious for euermore, delyuereth him ouer vnto wickyd spirites, placeth him in hell, and iudgeth him to euerlasting paynes. Iudge and discerne therefore betwene these two (my welbeloued) and chuse and obserue that which séemeth best vnto thée. Doo not so embase and make thy selfe vyle, that thou become a bondman to sinne &amp; to the diuill. Do some little thing for the loue of god. And do not thou neglect ye dignities, holines, comlynesse, &amp; godlynes, before rehearsed, for ye rytches, delightes, and honours of this most shorte and vncertayne lyfe. But lyue before the highest God, fearefully and waryly.

But dyse play and suche lyke are forebydden expressedly, especially to such as professe the trueth. And of dauncinge the same Chrisostome sayeth: where dauncing is cōmonly, (sayth he) there the diuill daunceth for company. Neyther dyd God lend vs our féete to the ende that we should exercise them in tryppinge lyke goates &amp; kyddes, but y• we might kéepe company with his holy Angels. Furthermore, if thou doo well consider how the sonne of God for thy sake was hanged vpon the crosse, with his armes stretched out, how for thy sake he was mocked and taunted in a white and purple garment, nay rather, how he was strypped naked, and naked raysed vp on the crosse, and there sundry wayes derided and mocked. I trust that thou wylt neyther take delight in dauncing, nor in curious, precious, nor pompous garmentes. No nor yet in the prayse of men, but wylt despyse and eschew all such vanities. As touching the garde and watch of thy tongue and speache, Salomon sayeth: He which kéepeth his mouth close, &amp; his tongue stil, he kéepeth his soule from perplexitie &amp; trouble of mynde.Pro. 21. And againe: Thou séest (sayeth he) the man which was so swyft to talke, folly it selfe is no more to be despysed thenPro. 29. his correction. And herevpon Gregorious sayeth: Flye from and eschew, rashe and vnwary woordes. For vayne talke dooth soone pollute the mynde. Let such thinges onely procéede out of thy mouth, as doo not pollute or offend the eares of them that herken therevnto. Uayne spéech is a token of a vayne mynde and conscience. For the talke of the tongue, is the Image of the hart.
               By the talke that we heare, we iudge the mynde that spake it. Whosoeuer dothe not brydle and represse ydle spéech, he shall quickly fall in offence. Such as the man is, such is his communicacion. Then if ydle talke be se much reprehended,

what shall we thinke of skurulous, deceyptfull, byting, slanderous, malicious, and enuious wordes?

Now it is certeyne that temporall thinges are directed, and ordered, vnto, and by the spirituall thinges, as vnto theyr ende and onely skope. But thend and terminable skope is loued and desyred one waye and the meanes and degrées whereby we atteyne to the ende, are loue &amp; desyred another way. For the ende is of it selfe &amp; by it selfe to be desyred &amp; loued. As (for example) health, in the facultie of Phisicke. But the meanes and degrées to attayne vnto thinges, are to be desyred and loued, in that they are profitable or auaileable to the attayning of the ende or skope which we séeke to gett. That is to saye, that by them the ende may the more conueuiently be obteyned. Then let the case be this, that ryches are finally ordeyned for the spirituall proceding &amp; profit of our soules. And therewithall ioyne that the profit and perfection of our soules doth concist in the action of vertue. That is to saye, essencially in the actes of faythe, charitie, and wysedome, (meaning the contemplacion and loue of diuine thinges) and dystributiuely in the actions of the morall vertues.
               Then shall we fynde that ryches are so much to be thought lawefull, so much to be desyred, and so much to be loued, as they are profitable and necessary for the sustentacion and sobre nourishment of our bodies, and for the néedefull and decent clothing of our membres. By the which vse the soule is made apt for the actes of contemplacion and diuine loue.
               But if they be further desyred, then fall we truely into couetousnesse, which is an vnordinate appetyte and desyre to temporal thinges and vanities. And is of it selfe and in it selfe a greuous and deadly sinne, and contrary vnto righteousnesse. Although sometymes god for his mercie doth beare

Here vnto the words of Hierome doe also agrée. Whatsoeuer (sayth hée) we haue receiued of god more then doth serue our necessary vse, that ought we to distribute vnto the pore. And if we bestowe vpō our owne vanyties &amp; affections, that which we receiued to employ vpō their néede. How many soeuer doe dye of hunger, or naked néede in y• places where we remayne, we shall render accompt for theyr bloode in the daye of iudgement. Herevpō Ambrose sayeth: He which is the bondman &amp; seruaunt of worldly rytches, let him kéepe and watche them as a bondman. But he which therwith doth loosen and shake of the yoke from such as are in bondage and captiuitye, he doth distrybute them lyke a Lord. These wordes doe generally concerne euery Christiane, but especially such as professe the Gospell.
               For they are bounde vnto an especyall cleannesse of hart and conuersaciō that they may be example to all other people. It is therefore most vndecent, &amp; worthy of all condempnation that they serue and are bondmen vnto the

Woe bee vnto you riche men which haue your consolation héere on earth. Therefore let vs be ashamed since many Heathon Philosophers dyd leaue vs examples of great sobrietie, much abstinence, and excéeding great contempt of excesse, and pompe in clothing and substaunce, and we which professe y• true knowledge of Christ, doe wallow and tomble in suche and so many ryottes, curiosities, and vayne pompes. Yea and that not onely such as are secular, but euen many of the Clergie which should lende example of perfection to the laye people.

For whom the Lord God loueth, him doeth he chastise, and is pleased in hym euen as the father is delighted in y• chyld. The equitie and iustice of God doeth requyre that as no good déede remayne vnrewarded, so none offence nor transgression be vnpunished. But euen the very electe doe not lyue in this world without offences and misdéeds, (for we offend all of vs in many things, and if we say that there is no sinne in vs, we deceyue our selues, for ye iust man falleth seuē times in a daye) and therefore it pertayneth vnto the diuine bountie and prouidence, to chastise vs in this lyfe, least we should be contemned in the world to come. And so of his

                  odde, is afeard to come vnto it agayne. Yea it maketh a man humbly

acknowledge, and bewayle his offences. Whervpon the Lord sayeth: I chastise thée, least thou shouldest séeme giltlesse in thyne owne conceipt. And agayn as Hieremie saith: Thou hast chastysed me (O Lord) and I am become skilfull thereby. Finally, such chastisement disposeth a man to greater delight in his iourney, and (if it be patiently borne) it obtayneth great reward in the heauenly kingdom. And therfore it is that God doth manifoldly chastise and correcte the elect in this lyfe, yea he doeth reproue and amend them as he sayth: Those whome I loue I chastise and reproue them. Whereby it may playnely appeare, that suche as God doeth not punishe in this worlde, but suffereth them to wander vntouched, yea and doeth prosper them in this worldly prosperitie, although they be replenished with many excéedyng great vyces, and suffreth them to clyme alofte, and to lyue Lordlyke at theyr pleasure: they are not of the electe number but of the reprobate. For it is written: All they which

And therefore though the reprobate be not chastised of God with a fatherly correction, that is for theyr desertes. Whereby they haue so incurred the wrathe and displeasure of God, that he vouchsafeth not to correcte them in this lyfe, but lettes them remayne vnto eternall tormentes in hell fyre.

sorte of sinnes and offences. Whereby all grace &amp; mercie is taken away, and the sinner doth spiritually dye therein, vnlesse he conuerte vnto the feare of God. Whereby it appeareth consequently, that he shall hardlye eschue and auoyde these gréeuous and greatest offences, which doeth not dayly accustome him selfe to eschue the least faults &amp; transgressions. For the common custome of triflyng faultes and misdéedes, doe bryng with them, the fallyng vnto greater enormities. Since the least doe dispose and (as it were) prepare a man vnto the greatest. Yea they take away the feruentnesse of charitie, and doe hynder and let the increase of grace in vs. Wherevpon the holy fathers affyrme: He that is negligent in small things, doth by a little and a little fall and

                  lyde away altogither. So that (my singulerly beloued) if thou wilt continue in the state of health, grace, and charitie, (that is to say, out of all gréeuous sin, and cause of dampnation) doe not onely be diligent to auoyd the greatest offences but the least also. For otherwyse thy fruites are deade before the face of God. Whose voice whē the shéepe heareth not, he strayeth and wandereth. Now it is a gréeuous sinne and offence more to cleaue and stick vnto, to be more delighted and affected, in the create, frayle, and vayn things of this world, then God him selfe. Whervpon Hierome sayeth: A mynd dedicated vnto God should as well beware of the least as of the greatest offences. Knowing that accompt must bée rendered of euery idle word. And therefore Gregorie sayth: He that taketh not héede of the least, falleth into the greatest offences. Then such as doe dayly follow vanities, laughyng, bablyng, sportyng, dallying, wandring here and there, and accustomyng them selues to all lightnesse, and in the meane whyle doe very seldome or neuer repent or amend, how can they choose but become culpable also of greater enormities?

And by whose godly aduyce, he may be instructed, kindled by his exhortations, and helped by his assistant prayers. For the frendship of such being founded on godlinesse and honestie, is of great force and efficacye before God. Wherevpon the auntient fathers sayde: that the fraudes and temptations of the diuill are by no worldly meanes more repulsed nor defended, then by the socyetie of a zealous friende vnto whom a man may laye open his harte and mynde. Least the power of the diuil being secretly shutte therein, doe infecte and vtterly distroy it. And therevpon it is written: A faythfull friend is a strongEccle. 6. protection. And he which hath founde such an one, hath a great treasure. There is no comparison to a faythful friend, neyther can the weight of Gold nor siluer counterpeyse hys fayth. A faythfull friend is a medicyne of lyfe and immortalitie, and suche as feare the Lorde shall fynde suche friendes.
               And in another place hee sayeth: Blessed is hee which fyndeth a faythfull friende. For since man is naturally a lyuing creature which defireth company, it is naturall (say theEccle. 35. Philosophers) that he should be helped. And since man is not a good iudge ouer him selfe, it is expedyent that hee open his griefe and conscyence to some other more méete to iudge thereof. Therefore harken vnto counsell, and bee not ruled by thyne owne sensuall appetyte. But endeuour thy selfe to eschue all familyaritie &amp; societie of wanton worldlings, for that is greatly hurtfull to thy soule.
               God is a spirite (as it is written in the fourth ChapiterIt is good to pray and sing Psalmes. of John) and they which worship him must worshipp

                   hym in spiryte and truth.
               And although wee ought deuoutly and carefully with all reuerence to performe and execute all the workes of God (for hée is accursed which doth the worke of God negligently)Hiere. 48.
                  
yet those actions of vertues which are immedyately (and without any interim) done and exercysed about God, ought to be done and exercysed with a greater reuerence and singular zeale. Now prayer, singing of Psalmes, and adminystring of sacramentes are actions of vertue pertayning vnto Gods honor. And therefore they are to be executed with all diligence and perfection. Wherevnto first is requyred the obseruation and kéeping of the diuyne prec
                     •…
                  ptes. For it is written: Hee that declineth his eare least hee should heare Gods law, hys prayer is execrable. And agayn: Cursed are they which declyne from thy commaundements. Therfore first the conuersation must be made conformable vnto the prayer, and nexte the harte must be vnyted vnto God by often proofe and continuall attentyuenesse. For of suche as are backewarde and doe not attende, the Lorde spake by EsayeEsai. 29. saying: This people honoreth me with their lippes, but their harte is farre from mée. And the wyse man sayde: BeforeEccle. 18. prayer, prepare thyne harte and soule, and be not lyke vnto a man which tempteth God. Therefore attentiuenesse is chiefly necessarie, and ought to be alwayes in the begynnyng of prayer and singyng of Psalmes. For the vertue of eche good beginnin

                   doeth shyne in as muche as followeth, and the latter ende followeth vertuously by guyde of a good beginning.
               Furthermore, for as much as there are thrée sundry effects in prayer, (that is) acceptation with God, obtayning of that we craue, and a certayne swéete refection of mynde which be féeleth that prayeth, the before named attentiuenesse shal be sufficient to the former two of these affectes. But vnto the third, there is requisite a continuall and mightie attentyuenesse. For according to Basilles wordes. Euen as the taste of the mouth doth discerne and taste euerie morsell or péece of the bodily sustenaunce, whilest it cheweth and gnaweth it, euen so the inwarde taste of the soule oughte in prayer and singyng of Psalmes to marke and taste the sence of euerye worde and sentence. And that

the forenamed actions and dueties may be perfectly discharged and executed, there is required a great warynesse and watchfulnesse of 
                     •…
                  arte, and an affectionate recollection or repiticion of 
                     〈◊〉
                   towardes God. And therefore some haue thought no 
                     〈◊〉
                   nor payne comparable vnto hartie prayer. But such prayer and singing of Psalmes is of great (and excéedyng great) efficatie towardes the obtayning at Gods handes of all things which we doe healthfully requyre. And there vpon Christ sayd: True worshippers and prayers, shal worship and pray to the father in spirit and veritie. And Basille sayeth: the diuyne helpe is to be craued, not 
                     •…
                  ackly, nor with a mynde wandring here and there, for suche an one shall not onely fayle to obtayne, but further shall styrre and prouoke God to anger. For it is requisite in tyme of prayer to behaue our selues purely, and stoutly. Stoutly, that wée may reuerently and ioyfully attend the Lord our God. Not sloughfally nor sléepily gaping and yawning, neither whisperyng and muttering, and cutting of our words in the middest, but with a stout and couragious sounde (as best becommeth) let vs pronounce our desires before the holy Ghost. Then purely also, that we thinke vpon none other thing but the Psalme or prayer which wée sing or say. For the holye ghost will not acceptably receyue that which is profered, if we neglecte that which is due vnto him. And pray not nor sing not ouer hastily. In praying and singing of Psalms we haue two especiall things to marke and attend. That is our owne myserie, and Gods mercie. To the ende that by the consideration of our owne myserie, imperfection, frayltie, and malice, we may be prouoked vnto true humilitie. And by the consideration of Gods mercy, goodnesse, and loue, we may be induced to a 
                     〈◊〉
                   desire to be vnited with him. And so the actions before rehearced may procéede of charitie and true humilitis, and all vayne chaunting may bee auoyded. Yea and that wée may desire to please God onely, and bee more delighted in the sence, then in the gallantnesse of the wordes, and more in deuotion, then in warblyng with the

voyce, least we commit any wanton gesture or action.
               For Augustine sayeth: whensoeuer it happeneth that I am more delyghted with the musicke, then with the effect of the wordes that are 
                     •…

                   offend gréeuously. And agayne: the barkyng of Dogges, the bleating of Cattell, and the gruntyng of Swyne, doeth more please God, then the chauntyng of wanton and ryotous Priestes. For what preuayleth the noyse of the lippes when the harte is dombe? And euen as a voyce without tunablenesse doeth séeme lyke the gruntyng of swyne, so beyng vsed without deuotion it is worse then the bleating of Calues. Wherfore let our prayers and denotiōs be sung or sayde distinctly, with a due reuerence, attentiuenesse, and affection. And in a méete place and tyme conuenient. Without bablyng of thinges impertinent. Without whisperyng and pratyng, and without dissolute laughing. It is written for our instruction, in the first Chapiter of Ecclesiast. O vanitieExamples of the vanitie of the world. of vanities, and all is vanitie.

may the more plainely appeare, I will a little touche howe much the Philosophers (being guided onely by naturall reason) haue abhorred such ydle and leude conuersation. Plato sayeth: It is not the parte of a Philosopher to studie about the pleasures &amp; delightes of meat, drinke, &amp; venerie. A Philosopher doth think it dishonor to be brauely apparelled or decked, &amp; is content with suche clothing as may serue his necessarie vse. A Philosophers intention is not about ye body, but furthest from it, and is wholly occupyed about consideration of the soule. The mynde and soule of the Phylosopher doth dispise and disdayne the bodye, and flyeth from it, that it selfe may bee wholly occupyed in and about it se

                  fe. For out of our bodyes procéede thousandes of impediments vnto contemplation, whilest we are busied for the necessarie sustentation therof. A Philosophers meditation, is the loosyng and separation of the mynd from the bodie. It is a rediculous thyng for a man that all his lyfe tyme dyd prepare hym selfe vnto death, if then when it commeth, hée bée troubled or molested therewith. If thou perceyue any man to shrynke at death when it commeth, say boldlye hée was no Phylosopher. As often as the mynde or soule is allured by the bodye vnto these worldely and chaungeable thynges, it is seduced and sore troubled. But as often as the mynde or soule is exercysed by it selfe in speculation, it is straight wayes transferred into sinceritie and immortalitie.
               The bodie and the mynde beyng both in one, nature

True Philosophers doe abstayne from all things that are corporal, &amp; are not gréedy louers of mony and riches. These sentences Plato affirmed. Now Socrates (by Saint Hieromes testimony) dyd vtterly contempne ryches. Dyogenes forsaking all these worldly pompes, dyd chuse to lyue in hys Tunne. Tullye and Seneca haue

The which wil be vnto hym most pleasaunt and acceptable. As Gregorie witnesseth saying: in that age that mans heare is yellow, his eyes glistering lyke christall, his face freshe as the Rose, his sound health encreaseth his strength and force, his yong and lustie yeares promise long continuance vpon earth, whilest reason and the sences are quicke, whilest the hearing is more readie, y• sight quicker, the gate vpright, the countenance louely, and the body lustie, they which in this age (sayeth he) doe rule and master them selues, and doe assocyate &amp; acquaynte them selues with God, they may expect and hope for the reward of the blessed Apostle and Euangelist Iohn.
               Where vpon Hierome sayeth: it is good for a man when he hath borne the yoke from his youth vpwardes. Therefore (welbeloued) doe not foreflow thy conuersion vnto the Lord, neyther defer from day to day, least his wrath come sodai

               Salomon in the xxix. of his Prouerbes sayeth: OurOf the vanitie &amp; wretchednesse of this present lyfe. dayes are as woundes vpon the earth, and yet there is no death. And Augustine in his thirtenth booke and tenth Chapiter De ciuitate dei, sayeth: From the tyme that any man begynneth to be in this mortall bodye, hee doeth incessauntly trauayle to dye. For therevnto tendeth all his mutabilitie in all hys lyfe (if it may bee called lyfe) that hee lyueth to that ende that death may come. For all men are néerer vnto death after a yeare finished, then they were before it begonne, to morrowe, then to day, to daye, then yesterday, and euen anon, then now.
               For all the while we lyue, some little space of our lyfe is taken away. And that which remayneth doth dayly become lesse and lesse. So that the whole course of this our lyfe, is nothyng els but a recourse vnto death. And in this course no man is suffred to stay nor to linger and goe softelyer then his fellowes. But all men are drouen on with equal steps and paces, and are all conceyued alyke to their ende. Neyther doeth he which dyeth soonest, passe ouer the day faster then an other whose lyfe lasted longer. But hauyng eche of them equall momentes and tymes to passe ouer equallye, that one had hys ende and determinate tyme set nearer, and that other further of.
               For it is one thing to haue lyued longer, and another thyng to haue gone or procéeded slower or quicker.
               And therfore whosoeuer doth the longer linger his dayes before he dye, he went notwithstanding neuer the more slowly, but he had the longer iourney to performe. Yea and if it should be accompted that a man doth begin to dye (I meane to bee dead in déede) from the fyrst moment that death claymed hys ryghte in thys our exyle, (whych is euen from

our swadlyng clontes) then all this lingryng and detracting of tyme, should in accoumpt be no tyme at all. For what other thyng doe we accomplysh in our dayes, houres, momentes, and tymes, then that thys lyfe beyng consumate, death (which all that whyle was in hande) may bée fulfilled. Of these things Augustyne speaketh largely in the Chapiter before rehearsed, and the Chapiter next following. But of the infinyte euilles and myseries of thys present lyfe, he treateth more playnely in hys xx. booke and xx. Chapiter of the same worke saying: As touching our first originall beginnyng, all mankynde was in damnable estate as well witnesseth thys our lyfe (if it bée a lyfe) so full of such and so excéedyng great euilles. For what els betokeneth the horrible depth of our ignorance, from whence all errour spryngeth? the which dyd receyue all Adams chyldren into a darkesome corner, so that a man can not from it bée delyuered without payne, sorowe, and dread? yea the inordynate loue which we beare to so many thynges giltye of vanitie, whereon so many cares doe ryst, so many perturbations, so many languyshings, 
                     •…
                  cares, madnesse, ioyes, dyscords, contentions, warres, treasons, wrathes, enimities, fraudes, theftes, spoyles, ryottes, and prides, do sufficiently bewray our miserie &amp; damnable estate. Furthermore, Augustine in his booke entituled De miseria mundi, doth plainly treat saying: Take héed to thy self least being wrapped in the snares of ye diuill, thou become a pray to y• hūter which rāgeth and séeketh whom he may deuour. For this lyfe is fugityue and vntrustie, since it doth not performe faithful dealing, no not to the louers therof. Yea euen from the beginning of the world it hath deceyued all such as put their trust therin. And all such as haue wrapped thē selues therein, it hath beguiled. And so it hath shewed it self vncertain to all men, y• it might proue it selfe a lyer vnto all men. For beholde the worlde which we so much loue &amp; estéeme, doth passe ouer &amp; 
                     •…
                  ly away. And yet we follow it

                     〈◊〉
                  .

So that beyng vnable to hold it vp falling, we fall with it percompany. Yea is not this our lyfe lyke vnto death, since therin doe abound so many dolors, lamentations, sighes, and so great miseries? one man being gréeued wt loffe cryeth out. Another cōtinually bewayleth the barenesse of his ground. One lamenteth the death of his friend, &amp; another sitteth sadly being ouer whelmed in pouertie. So y• there is much tribulation from y• time y• man commeth into this world. Yea his first voice or sound doth shew infirmitie. He is borne an infant, &amp; straight way cryeth out. He can not yet speake, &amp; neuerthelesse he is y• Prophet of his own calamitie. His teares are witnesse of his miserie, paine, &amp; dread, y• is to come. Whē he is growen a little, he beginneth to hunger, thirst, &amp; to bée weary. To conclude, man hath alwayes two sundry tormēts which (by turnes) doe vexe him continually. The which are: feare &amp; sorow. If A man be well, he feareth, &amp; if he be euil at ease he soroweth. What is he whom the prosperitie of thys world hath not deceiued? Or who is it y• hath not ben gréeued with y• aduersitie therof? thē behold man what great afflictions thou doest suffer in this world, which thou so much estemest. Wherin (in very déed) there are nothing but false &amp; deceiptful voluptuousnes, &amp; true (yea vndoubted) calamitie. No safetie of myrth and ioye, but a tormentyng feare, a gréedie couetousnesse, and a fruitlesse lamentation. And who is he which can number or accoumpt all the euilles and discommodities of this lyfe? For to ouerpasse with scilence those euilles which doe commonly oppresse all men (that is to say secret sorowes, and especiall griefes whereof all men may fynde them selues giltie) let a man but call to mynde what euylles hee hath both sustayned and committed from hys youth vpwardes, let him but set before hys eyes the tymes passed, and diligently consider howe many vayne labours he hath vndertakē, how often he hath swet in vain for ye loue of this wretched world.
               How often he hath founde deceyptfull issues of hys most earneste trauayles, and let hym then ponder that after

long troubles he hath yet obteyned no rest, and he shal quickly know what accoumpt is to be made of this world.
               O myserable man then what doest thou, or whether goest thou? whiles thou art in this world, thou doest but iust and roonne in a Tyltyearde. Wherein thou findest an enemie which is to strong for thée, whome thou neyther canst sée nor yet eskape from him. He entyseth thée with tryflyng toyesthereby to robbe and despoyle thée of the ioyes of heauen.
               Yea and thereby to put into thée, the very tormentes of hell. His lackye lyeth close hidden in the way, couered with earth which is the diuells concubyne and lenunan. The enimy of mankynde doth behold the manners and naturall enclynacions of euery man, and vnto what vyce they be most prone, &amp; those he setteth before theyr faces, which may most aptly allure and betray theyr myndes. And whiles he maketh them gaze at the gaynes of glystryng gold, they neuer sée the perill of theyr perdicion, but lyke fooles being deceiued with the delightes, which they sée and carnally doe loue, they neuer marke how they fall hedlong into damnacion. And bicause all men are voyde of vnderstandinge, they perishe perpetually. Wherefore if the world doe please and delight thée, beware the deceyptfulnesse thereof. Remember that as SalomonIacob. 14. sayeth: Lamentacion and dolor doo come in the ende of ioyes and merymentes. For all mans pleasantnesse is bytter and sowre in the ende. When a man reioyseth in the world be reioyseth not in God.
               But yet alas how many ther be which reioyse in the world, &amp; neuer reioyse in God? To reioyse in the worlde, is to boast, tryumphe, and glory, in iniquitie, vanitie, ryches, honor, outwarde coomlynesse, fylthy conuersacion, &amp; vayne pastimes with vnfreutefull and leuds communicacion. Which is in effecte, to purchase sorowe and lamentacion. For no man can embrace Christ and the world bothe attones. Many men professing Christ, doe prayse him, loue him, and rendre thanckes vnto him whiles they be in theyr worldly prosperitie. But if aduersitie light vpon them they cursse▪ &amp; blaspheme him.

Such men serue god for profit and not for loue. Unto whom the Lord God may iustly saye: For your owne benefit and commoditie you haue obserued my commaundementes, and not bicause you loued me with a pure entent. And wherefore doest thou extoll thy selfe in vanitie (O man) is not thy body (as the Preacher sayth) dust and asshes? Art not thouEccle. 10. thy selfe of earth, and shalt soone be resolued againe into earth? Looke into the Sepulchres of the greatest Prices, and sée if any other thing doe there remayne but bones and dust? And all this being thus, doest thou by so many errors make hast vnto hell, which hast bene enstructed in so many pathes to heauen by Christ him selfe? Why is that beloued which must be forsaken, and that neclected which may perpetually be enioyed? These sentences and many such lyke. Sainct Augustine dothe moste deuoutely propounde in his bookes before named. And finally he wryteth in a certeyne Sermon saying: Attende and marke, O myserable Soule of sinfull Man, that horryble houre in which thou shalt depart from the body. Where as thou shalt prefently beholde the wycked ministers of Sathan, the cursed diuills, the horryble dampned spirites, and the most crewell roaryng Lyones, ranging and hunting about for theyr praye, which is thy sorowfull selfe. With the twynekling of an eye, the horryble places of eternall paynes shall apeare, the Chaos or confu

            A LETTER WRYTTEN by I. B. vnto his famyliar frende G. P. teaching remedies against the bytternesse of Death.
            
               WHen I remember your request made vnto me at our last parting, which was, that I should wryte some what vnto you, either to ingender in you a meditacion of contented death, or at the least to diminish the desyre of long lyfe, I can not but much lyke and commend in you that disposition, whereby it appeareth your desyre and mynde is let not in the loue of things transitory, but in knowledge, and in that knowledge, which of all other is moste perfect and méete for a wyse man: For if that be worth the learning that is necessary, and that for euery age, degrée, and sexe, all creatures must necessarily dye, and no man of reason dyeth better, and more lyke a man, then he that hathe learned the Science thereof. And if that knowledge be worth the learning, whereof commeth certeyne and great commoditie, none can be compared with the Scyence of well dying, the fruite whereof is comfort, and lyfe neuer en

               ynge.
            
               And as this knowledge is most perfect &amp; worthie learninge, so haue you taken a verye méete and conuenient tyme for the atteyninge of it, which is youth the flower of your age, haing in it selfe strengthe and habilitie to learne any Scyence, and leauing tyme to practise that is well learned. For as none other science profitable (being lyberall) is sodenly learned, neither is it enough to byd a man though he be wytty, sodenly to drawe a figure in Geometrie, make a proporcion by Arithmiticke, be a good sowldier, ingenier or other lyke, (for he may say he lacketh tyme, teaching, and exercise to atteyne such knowledge,) euen so is the science of dying wel, to be learnid with tyme, meditacion, and exercise. And who so sayth to a sicke man not practised herein, be content to dye, &amp; forgo this mortal life, may here of him againe I know, what it is to lyue by experience, but to dye I haue not learned, and the lesson is not so easie as you thinke it. Wherein if many would doo, as you séeme to meane, that is, to learne to dye when they may b

            And now somewhat to satisfie your desyre, and to entre into this treatie, which I entende not to make longe, I wyl kéepe this ordre, Fyrst to shew that vnto a Christian man, Death is not to be fledde, but rather to be desyred, or at the least well to be taken, no plague, but

To the heathen not knowing GOD, nor the vertue of the lyfe to come, the first parte, that Death is not to be fledde, shonnid, and terrible, is a lesson harde, or rather vnposs

And the excelent Dratour, who in health and wealth spakeCicero. lyke a whole man, and as a man learnid, perswaded other, being for a tyme banished, was him self without all comfort. And when he drewe towardes death, perceued he had sayde more then he could iustifie, and performe in him selfe. In lyke case was the Emperour for wisedome so much renowmed,M. Aurelius. who approching néere to death, and speaking as he founde cause by proofe, and tryall, and not as he before had vaynely thought, sayde, he was toubled with the feare of Death, bicause he knewe not whether he should goe, nor what the gods immortall (for so he termid them) had determined of him, vnto whome he recommendid him selfe with this doubt, that if they had appoynted any good of him, they should then shew it.
            These thrée examples of the best, with other able to fill a great volume, doe well shewe that the heathen were not learned in this sciēce, an

and that not onely men, in whome naturally courage is, but women and children, whose weake sexe and tender age declared more playnely what true and hartie loue is able to worke, which as it brought Christ downe from heauen into earth, so being truely rooted in man it is able to draw him from earth into heauen, without respect had to him selfe, or any thing that is his.
            And thus much spoken of the first parte doth now make the waye open to bring in the second, for it may be sayde, if there be any meanes to take away the feare of Death, and diminish the desire of lyfe, who should atteyne to the same so soone as christian men. And sith we be all of that number, howe commeth it then to passe that so fewe are contented to dye, and many so affrayde thereof, that neither them selues will thinke of it, nor willingly heare other speake of it. To the which question, although I might in fewe woordes aunswere, and say that there lacketh in vs that lyuely and perfect loue of God and the lyfe to come, which should be in vs and was in them of whome I spake. Yet to make this point more playne (for it is lesse to saye all then to touche eache parte of all) I finde thrée causes especiall that make men desirous to liue and lothe to dye.
            1 The one is our weakenesse which séemeth to haue some excuse, bicause nature desireth the conceruacion of it selfe, &amp; abhorreth dissolucion which both taketh away our being, and also bringeth with it great gréefe and paynes, which men séeing in other and flying in them selfe, feare Deathe, whose seruants and messengers they are.
            2 The second cause is, either the lacke or the small quantitie of fayth in vs, whereby we beleue not, or fayntly beleue the meruailous promises of incomparable blysse promised by GOD vnto his faythfull, after this transitory and present lyfe.
            3 But the greatest cause is the third, which is a loue and swéetenesse conceaued of this lyfe, the goods and commodyties of the same, wherewith who so is possessed, it can not

be auoided, but vnto him the very remēbrāce of death which taketh frō him that he loueth, must be sower &amp; bitter, as the scripture saith. To say somewhat to these thrée things which maketh lyfe swéet &amp; death sower, is the third part of my matter, which I promised to entreate of.
            And for the first, which is a naturall weaknes ingēdering of it selfe the feare of death, we can not say it hath no power in vs mortal men, sith Christ our patron being more thā man confessed to haue some féeling of it in him selfe. But if we cō
               sider yt he was weak to make vs strong, who gaue the onset, &amp; made the conquest of death &amp; weaknes, &amp; that not for him selfe, but for vs, &amp; in our nature, saying afterwarde to vs, be bolde &amp; feare not, I haue made a conquest of the world, And y• he hath by taking on him our nature, meruelously ioyned &amp; incorporated vs vnto him, so that by grace &amp; participaciō y• is true in vs, which by perfection of nature was true in him, thē fynde we that this weaknes remayneth not as before in his force, but is inforced &amp; coūteruayled by a strēgth geuen vs besides our selues, which bicause we should firmely beleue, not to be imagined or onely in words, but true &amp; in déedes, God hath shewed it by the example of thousandes of his martirs, not flying as before is said, but desiring death, not fearing but contēning it, triumphing in tormēt, cōquering in weakenes, not saying, sad &amp; heauie is myne hart vntil death be past, but I desire to be in the féeling to begin to lyue, swéete is the torture, colde is the fire, dul is the axe, for what is ther in death dreadful vnto a faythfull &amp; christian man, is it the dissolucion of the bodie? that a christian man desireth? who is able to say I long to be dissolued: is it that death bringeth an ende of life &amp; being heare? that is not much to him that knoweth he hath an other lyfe to come, in comparison of which this is no lyfe but death, no ioy but sorow, no ease but trauayle, no quiet but misery. So that either there is in deade very smal &amp; weake faith in vs to beleue gods promises infallibly made to all his. Or if we doo assuredly beleue thē, the greatest feare in that behalfe is past, for he that loseth his lyfe temporall, fyndeth

eternal, goeth frō labour to rest, from ye sea into the hauen, frō weaknes to strength, from sicknes to health, from death to lyfe, from sinne to iustice, from sorow, heuines, &amp; paine, to the place where there is no gréefe nor sighinge, those former parts are then past. Let the heathen feare to dye, who may truely say, I know not whether I goe, nor what is ordeyned for me, to what ende the gods haue created me, whether it be good or no, who are borne in sin, &amp; not new borne in holines, who haue neither teaching or knowledge of life, neither promis of the same. But a christiā man being taught y• death is the entre to lyfe, that he is ordeyned to lyue with Christ, created to be partaker of his glory, regenerat &amp; sanctified by him with promis of blisse inestimable, if he after all this retorne to the same loue of lyfe &amp; feare of death y• is in ye gentil, what doth he then else, but practise to be come a gentil &amp; heathen again, selling away his enheritāce for lesse then a messe of potage, and renoūcing his priuiledge whervnto he is singularly and especially called.
            But as we haue sayd before, weaknes may be a great cause to make a man feare death, &amp; lack of beléefe a greater, but yet are they not ye greatest, for perfect loue ouercōmeth weaknes increaseth &amp; reuiueth faith, wher loue is whole &amp; sounde, the rest is soone recouered, if it be lost, or increased if it be decated. But if loue be either deuided betwene god &amp; this world &amp; lyfe present, or wholly trāslated frō god vnto things trāsitory, How should a man be content to parte frō y• he loueth, and séeke that he careth not for, sithe it is so true, saying, yt where the man loueth, he lyueth, and vnpossible is it, that who so is delited here &amp; possessed with the loue of this lyfe, should willingly heare of death, which can onely be welcome to them, that therby desire to be with Christ, whom they loue better then thēselues or this lyfe, &amp; so can be cōtent to leaue ye good for ye better, their welbeloued for the best beloued, or y• they estéeme light they entirely and tenderly loue: For if it be asked what is the thing of such force y• is able to make a man content to forsake his goods, his liuing, him selfe and his life if we will answere truely and in fewe words, we must say

it is loue &amp; nothing else, which wher so euer it be fa

            And herein to vse some exāples, it was none other thing ye made the Philosopher cast himselfe into the burning fire of Aetna, nor the Romain getleman-on horse backe to leape in wher y• earth gaped, ye young man after y• reading of Platoes booke, to break his neck, So many captains &amp; souldiers wyllingly &amp; wittingly to goe to their death, but loue: They louid somthing better then lyfe, the wysest their coūtry and frendes whome they would preserue, thother fame, and as they called it immortalitie, the lightest vayne estimacion &amp; glory, but euery one somwhat wherewith they were ledde.
            Sith thē loue is of such force, as y• same is able to bereue a man not only of his goods &amp; treasure, but also of his lyfe and that by his owne will and cōsent, the right waye to learne cōtentidly to receaue death when god sendeth it, is to learne to employ wel &amp; fasten our loue wher it should be &amp; is due, that is vppō god, and the lyfe to come, louing that onely for it selfe, and other things so much and so farre, as we neither change nor remoue y• out of his place, which lesson if it be not onely beleued but practised, maketh the lyfe godly and comfortable, and ye death easy. And who so euer marieth him to the loue of the world, following y• desires thereof, and making the desyres of it his delight, yt man may speake boldly of death vntil it come. But when he shal stand vpon his gard to receue ye assault, he must &amp; will vndoubtedly shrink &amp; shew him selfe a weake souldier, lacking ye armour yt should thē defend him, for if faith his buckler byd him be strong, &amp; thinck vpon ye cōquest, yt Christ his captaine hath made, &amp; vpon yt triumph y• is prouided for him, his owne hart &amp; cōscience, which is néere him than his armour, will saye, all yt is prouided for such as beare their loue &amp; true hart to their onely captaine, whome they promised to serue, for such as before in ye time of theyr seruice dyd resist his enimie &amp; his attēptes, and not for such as yelded themselues prisoners vnto him, content to be in his Campe, and to fight vnder his banner. His sword

which is the worde of God, being not well handeled of him before, nor much occupied, wyll then agrée ill with his hand, &amp; he for lack of exercise, not able to giue a strong blow therwith, his curates of charitie so thin, that eache dart &amp; arrow shal perce it, his helm of hope vnlyned, neither wel fitting to his head, nor able to kéepe of the force of ye byll. Is it possible think ye y• a souldier thus armed, &amp; besides this not exercised in feates of warre, shold withstād a mightie, strōg practised &amp; wel armed man? no verely. He wil either runne away, if the groūd serue him or with shame be takē prisoner and captine.
            When I consider the maner of dying of such as were in gods fauour, of whom we reade in the Scriptures old &amp; new &amp; cōpare our selues with thē, how willing, ready, &amp; glad they were to leaue this lyfe, how loath, backwarde, &amp; sory, we are for the greater part to doe the same, I meruaile we should be called one mans children, that are so vnlyke in condicion.
            Moses being tolde he should no longer lyue, &amp; therefore to prouide his successour dyd we his own hands ordre &amp; appoynt Iosua without cōplaynt, sorow, or token of gréefe, prouiding for thē yt shold. lyue, as it were nothing thinking on him selfe.
            Isaac byd his sonne go hunt, prouide &amp; gett him meat, that he might blesse him before he dyed. The lycke cōtentaciō appeared in Iacob, Tobias, Dauid, &amp; sundry other whome we finde not onely neuer to haue shunned death, but cōtentedly to haue receaued it. The loue they bare vnto God &amp; his will in their lyfe, kept thē from disorderid loue of the world, and frō the cōmon sinnes &amp; vices, which men for worldly thinges cōmit, &amp; being not troubled with conscience &amp; remorce therof, sawe no cause to shunne &amp; to feare death. And as this loue of god, &amp; his wil, encreased in the new testament, where the holy ghost, the spirit of loue, was &amp; is more plētiously powred in to y• harts of ye right beleuīg. So ye loue of lyfe decresed, &amp; the desire of death increased in y• best professors therof, the appostles &amp; martirs infinite, not only cōtented to leue this life, but also desir eddeath. who receuig ye faith &amp; gospel, &amp; beig taught therby to cōfornie thē selues to y• life &amp; image of Christ, did wt

For faith teacheth Gods mercy, &amp; his iustice, and if iustice be all against vs, either faith ingendreth in vs sorow of such a life, and so repentance which is good, &amp; an entry toward life, or if it ingender not an earnest repentance, it bringeth nothing to comfort, ease, &amp; releue vs, but all contrary.

Such a man liuing cōtētedly in y• place wherin he is called, &amp; traueling carefully to fil &amp; satisfie the same, whē death approcheth, doth méekly say to God with Christ, I haue done ye worke thou sentest me to doe. And albeit there hath bene much weaknesse &amp; many infirmities in his trauel and accomplishing that worke he was sent to doe, yet with a great indifferencie, he shal be able to vse ye words of ye vertuous &amp; learned Bishop, neither haue I liued so among you that I should be ashamed to liue, neither doe I feare to die, bicause we haue a good Lord &amp; master. The man so liuyng,

and so thinking is onely happie, neither troubled with inordinate desire of highe estate, which he taketh but for a place to trauayle for many, neither affrayde to be in meaner then he is, knowing that where so euer God placeth him he hath his worke to doe, wherwith he may please him, euer quyet, content to dye, and not vnwilling to liue.
            But here some man may say, although he be not disordridly desirous of life, yet can he well be cōtēt to liue, though not for him self, or for his owne sake, yet for others, &amp; therin wisheth nothing vngodly, but decētly to kéepe ye place whervnto he is called, which he can fill, if not better, yet as wel as an other mā, to help such as néed him, to bring vp his childrē, to see thē disposed, &amp; finally to bestow ye benifits y• God hath lent vnto him, he y• maketh this obiectiō, &amp; lieth not on him self, is not of y• worst sort, nor much to be misliked, vnto whō neuertheles it must be answered, if his desire be to liue for others, who by him may be y• better, he must cōsider y• wel doing is not all his own, wherof though mā be y• minister, God is the giuer, &amp; who will dispose him self to doe many good, and none hurt, &amp; so cōtinue God knoweth, man knoweth not, but this mā knoweth, y• wtout gods giuing he doth it not, &amp; wel knoweth he also, y• happie had bene Salomō if he had ben taken in his youth, &amp; wel doing, the like may ye read of many, &amp; say by experience of some, &amp; whither he would be one of them by long life he knoweth not, if ther were no daūger, it shuld not haue ben writtē, he y• stādeth, let him take héed y• he fal not, if he think there were no daūger in him self, thē is he proud, and lyke to be one of them that would fall, if he doubt, then is it wisdome to put him self to him that knoweth. And sith he knoweth and is sure that after death no sinne is done, better is the choyse to go with safetie as Gods seruant whē God willeth, then in continuaunce to put that in a hazarde, which if it goe amisse, at the ende can not be recouered, nor the losse redubled. Déepe in payne lye many, who by long lyfe fell into sinne, and therby into their damnation, who had then dyed in their youth, had lyued with Christ, and howe

much they bewaile their long life, &amp; the oceas

               , no tonge can tell, nor harte thinke. But to returne to the matter, if he say he would doe many good in long tyme, and lyue accordyng to his place and callyng, let him shewe that in the tyme he hath giuen him, and if (in so doing) he be takē, sith he may say to God, I haue done the worke thou sentest me to doe, and when God calleth hym away, hee knoweth there is no more appointed for hym to doe, he knoweth also there is no more cause for him to lyue, bicause desire of doing good was the only cause why he would lyue. His childre are Gods more then his, who leaueth not the seede of the iust, who calleth him selfe the father of Orphans, and iudge of Widdows, whose blessyng if they haue, they shal prosper, though they lacke a mortall father. And if they lacke that, much sorow and small comforte should the father haue, to see that he could not amend, for eche good father neither maketh, nor leaueth a good chyld. And yet doeth not such a man lacke wyfe and friendes to whom he may commit the care of children, and if his friendes will doe much for them at his request and recommendation, why should he mistrust Gods prōuydence, helpe and dyrection, if hée commend them vnto hym? By whom hym selfe lyued, wyfe and friends, wit, strength, goods, and reuenue with other lyke, which to inioy men desire to liue, good giftes are to be taken thankfully at the giuers handes, and so long to be kept as may stand with the giuers will, and good contentation, but as no ciuil gyfte deliuered vpon condition may curteously be required beyond and agaynst the gyuers mynde, although he be our equal, or inferior, so Gods giftes who oweth no man ought, and giueth all without cause, haue much more this condition to be rendered at his call, fréely and willingly as they were, deliuered, or rather lent, which giftes of his as loue tokens, should not serue to make vs wishe long to be from him, for then is his loue ill recompensed, but should make vs desire to bée with hym, and to sée him, of whom we haue receiued them.
            
               As the Prince, who sendeth to his seruant being in a forren countrey farre from him, Iewels precious in token of remembrance, doth therby moue a kynd &amp; louing seruant the sooner to return to y• presence of so good &amp; mindful a Lord, especially if y• presence of his sayd Lord shalbe infinitly more worth to him then all his former tokens, for although it bée not blame worthie for any man to vse Gods gifts, &amp; to delite in thē, yet if he loue ye gifts, &amp; forget ye giuer, he is very vnkynd &amp; if he loue both ye gifts, &amp; the giuer, vnlesse y• one loue so farre surmount the other, that in comparison of ye greater, the lesse be drowned, &amp; appeare nothing, that loue is disordered, taking good for the best, &amp; resting where it should begin, I leaue here vnsaid, that health and strength of bodie may impayre by sickenesse, wife be lost by death, &amp; friends turne to enimyes, goods and reuenewes casuall, suche as may decay, or without desert be taken away to ye occasion of great heauines &amp; sorow, of al which who so maketh otherwise his accompte is farre deceiued, so that to leaue them whole vntouched of any mishap before rehersed, and many other that may chaunce, is not lost but gaine.
