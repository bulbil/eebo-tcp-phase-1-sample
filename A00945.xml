            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

And alſo manie very notable vertues, with their due commendations, ſo liuely and truly expreſſed, according to the holy word, that the godly Reader, being of a Christian inclination, will be mightily inflamed with a loue vnto them.

Your Honors continuall and faithfull care, to do good to your natiue countrie: your vnfained and moſt hartie zeale, in fauouring true religion: your very good liking and loue, towards all that feare the Lorde: your miſliking of vice, and loue to vertue: your readineſſe to do good to all, both for their bodies and ſoules, and to hurt none: Theſe things (I ſay) haue giuen me this boldnes, vnder your Honors protection, to publiſh and to ſend abroad, this my little labour, as a poore token of my good will, and loue in Chriſt, towards all the ſeruants and children of God, nothing doubting, but that for your Honors ſake, it will be the better welcome, to all that feare God, and with the greater diligence read, imbraced, and imitated of all: And I my ſelfe the more incouraged to labour heerafter, and to thinke no pains great, whatſoeuer I am able to vndergoe and to indure, to profite

others, to increaſe knowledge in the ignorant, and to further the ſaluation of all men. Againe, the remembrance of that moſt vertuous and godlie Ladie, Ladie Marie your Honors good and gracious ſiſter, wife to the very worſhipful and good Knight, ſir George Sauill, when I was preacher in Wakefield, to me and to all that feare God, a moſt Chriſtian friende, did euen ſeeme to warrant me (though I am vnknowen to your Honour) that you are readier to further, than I am to perform any good worke. Laſtly, the readineſſe to knowe God, and their obedience vnto the higheſt and almightie, that I found in thoſe gracious branches, ſweete virgins, and moſt towarde Ladies, your Honors owne daughters, when I being preacher at Clerkenwell, they were with that vertuous, gracious, and very religious gentlewoman, ſomtimes mother to hir Maieſties Maides of honor, and my very worſhipful friend miſtreſſe Winfield, hath giuen me great comfort, to thruſt out this little booke of mine, vnder your Honors protection, to do good to them, that you and I both do loue (as I aſſure my ſelfe) in Chriſt Ieſu. Thus without troubling your Honor any longer, I beſeech the Almightie to bleſſe your Honors ſelfe, the honorable and godlie Ladie your wife, your Ladie daughters, and all that appertaine to your Honor, if they appertain to God.

            A paterne of a curſed tree, and the fruite and end of the ſame.
            
               WHen the ſonne of God, the redeemer of the world, Christ Ieſus, was heere below vpon the earth, ſo truelie in his bodie, as we be now in our bodies, ſauing that he was cleere and free from all corruption of ſinne, and as he walked, being pinched with hunger, did eſpie a goodlie fig tree, which with the faire, greene,
               Matth. 
                     •
                  1. 12. 
               and flouriſhing leaues, did offer vnto him ſome hope of releefe, and comming to it, finding it fruitleſſe, and being diſappointed of his hope, he
               Mark. 11. 12. &amp; 13. 
               curſed it, and commanded that it ſhould be cut downe, and cast into the fire. If he dealt ſo with trees, that did beare no fruite at all, we may warrant and aſſure our ſelues, that he will curſe, cut downe, and cast into the fire that neuer ſhall be quenched, euery tree, that is, euerie man, that bringeth foorth ſuch fruits, as this tree beareth. If the Lord his curſe belongeth to a barren tree, that beareth no fruit, much more doth it belong, to thoſe trees, which bring foorth bad fruites. If trees that are vnprofitable, bicauſe they beare nothing but leaues, are fitter for the fire, then to trouble the earth, then much more thoſe trees that are ſo heauie loden, and ſo full of poyſon, that a man cannot touch one twig of them, but it killeth his ſoule and bodie, for euer. Such a tree is euerie one that beareth ſuch fruites in his life and manners, as this tree doth. No good Christian therefore, will delight &amp; pleaſe himſelfe with the ſhadow of ſuch a tree, neither build his nest in any part, or branch of it: but rather will do his greatest indeuor to pull it downe. Do thou (good Christian) thy best, and be ſure the Lorde will take thy part. And howſoeuer earthlie iusticers, let ſlip their parts, and forget to do their duties, the Lord will neuer forget nor let ſlip his part. Heere thou ſeest Iustice hath faſtened his coard to the top of the tree, and Veritie is hacking▪ at the roote, betweene them both to ouerthrowe it. Now if thou louest righteouſnes, and art a friende to truth, take their parts in this buſines, pull downe with Iustice, and ſtrike with Veritie, lend ech of them one of thy hands, and thy hart too, and keepe neither hart nor hand to thinke or to worke any maner of euill, it is better for thee, to haue no hand, no eie, no foote, then wicked ones. Do thy best that this tree may be destroied heere in this world, whiles it is to day, leaſt to morrow thou be deſtroied, for not labouring about it. I meane not that thou ſhouldeſt rend this paper and caſt it in the fire, but that thou ſhouldest examine, thy owne hart and thy conſcience, to ſee

whether any root, branch or twig of ſuch a tree be there, and if thou ſhalt finde any, to plucke them out and to cast them into the fire. Otherwiſe thou haſt nothing elſe looke for, but euen that which made the figge tree to wither, to wit, the malediction and curſe of God. And although Couetouſnes heere doth keepe the roote, and Selfe-loue the top of the tree, yet there is not any fruite, that this tree beareth, that is not ſufficient to bring foorth, as great and as tall a tree as this is, and alſo to furniſh it, and throughly to load euery twig of it, that they bend and break, with ſuch poyſonfull and curſed fruits as theſe be. For the ſinnes of men are innumerable, as the ſands vpon the ſhore by the ſea ſide, and the ſtars of heauen. Who can tell ſaith the holie prophet, how often he offendeth? The ſharpe edge of the axe of Gods wrath, is euer toward the roote of
               Matth. 3. 10. 
               this tree, and he is dailie telling vs, that it ſhall haue a foule fall at the length: he in loue to our ſaluation, doth premoniſh vs, that we may be carefull, and take heed to our ſelues, that we be not found in, or neere this tree, in any good liking or loue to it, when the finall fall of it ſhall be. Take heede (ſaith Chriſt) and beware of couetouſnes, though a man
               Luc. 12. 15. Epheſ. 5. 3. 1. Cor. 5. 10. 1. Tim. 6. 10. 
               haue aboundance, yet his life ſtandeth not in his riches. And the apoſtle doth aduiſe the Epheſians, to baniſh from among them the very name of couetouſnes. And he would haue the Corinthians neither to eate nor drinke with couetous men. And his reaſon is, bicauſe covetouſnes is the roote of all euill. As if he ſhould ſaie, where couetouſnes is rooted, there is not onely a barrennes of all good things, but alſo a great groue, and thicke wood of all abhominations. I refer thee (good Reader) to the Booke it ſelfe, where euerie branch, and all the fruits of this tree, be opened ſo plainly, and the poyſon of them ſo expreſſelie declared, that euery good chriſtian, ſeeing what danger is in them, will beware, that willingly he neuer touch nor taſte the leaſt of them: And not onely that, but alſo out of the tree, of a liuely faith, will bring foorth ſuch fruite of holines, truth, and righteouſnes, as may be well pleaſing, and acceptable in the ſight of God. Both which things the Lord grant vs.

This ſwéete dew of the Goſpell of Chriſt, God hath giuen to vs, in our daies very plentifully, and in great meaſure, according to that the kinglie prophet ſaith: Thou, O God, wilt reſerue a ſeaſonablePſalm. 61. 9. raine for thine inheritance: that is, thy heauenly doctrine, for thine elect and choſen children. Ezechiel alſo, There ſhall beEzec. 34. 26. the dewes of his bleſſing.
            
            
               AS he that entreth into a faire, and goodly goldſmithes ſhop,7 richly furniſhed with pretious pearles, and coſtly iewels of all ſorts, ought not to miſlike thoſe excellent things, &amp; great treaſures, bicauſe he ſéeth among them, a blacke fornace, duſtie coles, and ſundrie inſtruments of baſe mettall, bicauſe thoſe inſtruments, coles and fornace, muſt néedes be had, to make thoſe iewels, as chaines, earerings and bracelets of gold, withal: So in the church of God, where are innumerable men, ſome famous for their wiſedome, ſome renowmed for their pietie, ſome forward and feruent in Chriſtian loue and charitie: and many excelling in all kinde of vertues: if a man ſhall ſée there, ſome vnlearned, ſome deceiuers, ſome wicked ones, ſome tyrants, and many vngodlie ones, he ought not therefore, to picke a quarrel againſt the church of Chriſt, nor yet to thinke of the ruine and deſtruction of the ſame. For there ſhould be no martyrs, if there were no tyrants. The Lord would not haue created (ſaith Auguſtine) eitherAugust. de ciui

               AS one candle cannot light another, if it ſelfe be put out: So a8 prelate or preacher, ſhal not inflame others, with the loue of God, himſelfe being voide, and without that ſame loue.
               And yet I know, it is poſſible, if it pleaſe God, that by a wicked and vngodly man, ſinners may be conuerted, and brought to repentance.
            
            
               
               FOr euen as a godly maiſter, ſomtime giueth a good almes,9 by the hand of a wicked ſeruant: So God (if it ſeeme good to him) by the miniſterie of an euill man, can draw the vngodly, to know him, to feare and to loue him.
               Yet neuertheles, I do exhort all the miniſters, and preachersGood counſell. of the Goſpell, to do their beſt indeuour, to kéepe themſelues vnſpotted of the world, and ſo boldly (but charitably) to reprooue, taunt, checke, and chide the ſinnes and iniquities of others.
               The tongs and the ſnuffers, which were in Salomons Temple,Exod. 37 23. wherewith they did ſnuffe the lamps, were of moſt pure golde (as the ſcriptures do report) to ſignifie the puritie and cleannes of them, which are bound to reprehend and to correct, the ſlips and faults of others.
            
            
               AS he which hoordeth vp, and hideth his wheate, that it may10 not helpe &amp; ſuccour hungrie ſoules, in the time of dearth, is grieuouſly curſed of men, women and children: and he that in a famine and great dearth doth bring foorth his corne, and ſelleth it, is highly praiſed and praied for, of the people: So that miniſter and preacher, deſerueth ſharpe and rough reprehenſions, which will not impart his knowledge and ſkill, to the hungrie and thirſtie ſoules, of the children of God: and he is woorthily praiſed, which openeth vnto them, the garner of diuine doctrine, which teacheth and preacheth, and doth faithfully exerciſe the office of a watchman.

               EVen as Perillus that ſkilfull workman of Athens, that he11 might gratifie Phalarides that cruell tyrant, preſented him with an vglie bull of braſſe, wherin men being incloſed, might be tormented and afflicted, with a ſtrange engine, and new deuiſed torture, loſt his life, &amp; ſuffered a moſt fearfull death, by that his owne inuention, as Plinie reporteth in the tenth booke of examples: for at the commandement of the wicked tyrant, he being incloſed, and faſt ſhut vp, in the bull, which with great ſkill, and no leſſe charges, he had moſt cunningly and curiouſly wrought, that he might delight the eares of Phalarides, a moſt ſauage tyrant, and void of all humanitie, with the lamentable ſhrikes

and intolerable tortures and torments of men, he himſelfe firſt by experience, tried the paine and ſmart thereof, and imbrewed in his owne blood, that famous and curious péece of worke, which he had deuiſed to torment others withall: Right ſo, wicked and cruell counſell, many times redoundeth vpon the heads of the authors of the ſame: according to that of the Pſalmiſt:
               He ſpred his net, he digged déepe, and fell himſelfe, into thePſalm. 8. pit, which he made for others: Let his craftines be turned vpon his owne head, and let his iniquitie fall vpon his owne pate.
               Wicked Haman was hanged himſelfe, vpon the gallowes,Eſter. 7. which he had prepared for good Mardocheus.
            
            
               AS a field, although it be fertile, without tillage cannot be12 fruitfull: So the minde of man, without the word of God, and heauenly inſtruction, muſt néedes be barren, and can bring foorth no effects of faith, nor fruits of godlines.
            
            
               AS the ſea (eſpecially that, which is called Mare mediterraneum)
                  13 is woont to imitate the aire, as, if the aire be calme, the ſea is very calme alſo, if the aire be ſtormie, the ſea alſo is very ſtormie: Euen ſo the common ſort of people, in all places for the moſt part, do follow their prince: if princes be iuſt, ſubiects loue iuſtice: if the prince be vngodly, they imbrace vngodlines.
               Therefore, it was woorthily obſerued and ſaid, of wiſe men in times paſt, That the people is the ſhadow of the prince.
               A king or prince giuen to iniquitie, with his ſin killeth himſelfe, and with his example many others, bicauſe he hath many followers. For we do ſée, that whatſoeuer alteration and change of maners, ſhall be in princes, the ſame is woont to follow in the people: for princes do not onely conceiue vertues or vices themſelues, but alſo, they do as it were powre them, into the citie and countrie where they raigne and rule.
            
            
               EVen as a brooke doth follow the nature of the fountaine,14 from whence it commeth: So people do follow the diſpoſition of their prince: the fountaine being troubled, the brooke is troubled alſo, and the prince diſquieted, the people finde no peace.
               Herod the king was troubled, and all Ieruſalem with him.Matth. 2.
               
               
                  Whiles he raigned, impietie ruled, good lawes were nothing ſet by, iuſtice and iudgement lay dead, ancient and laudable cuſtoms were baniſhed, there was no reſt, no peace, which is the end of godly gouernment. For, to that end are gouernors ordained, that people may liue in peace.
               The worke of iuſtice, ſhall be peace.Eſay. 32. Pſal. 85. Pſal. 72.

               AS the roote of a trée, being vtterly rotten, the boughes cannot15 bud and floriſh, nor bring foorth pleaſant fruits in their due time: So iuſtice being violated, it cannot be, that peace can floriſh, and bring foorth ſo plentifull fruits, as ſhe is woont to do.
            
            
               THe proſperitie of this world, is as the cléerenes of winter16 weather: as the calmnes of the ſea, and ſtabilitie of the moone. As theſe do wauer, and be ſuddenly changed: So the ſtate of wealth and worldly things, hath no firmnes, no perpetuitie, no conſtancie: for as it is ſaid: All theſe things paſſeSapient. 5. away like a ſhadowe, and are as a meſſenger running afore.
               Man flieth away like a ſhadow, and neuer continueth in oneIob. 33. ſtate. For ſomtime it falleth out, that when thou doſt thinke, thy ſelfe to haue gotten innumerable riches, and great dignitie, and that thou art ſet, euen in the top of excellencie and honor, then all of a ſudden, in the twinkling of an eie, thou art hurled from that high and mounting glorie of the world, downe headlong into a bottomles gulfe of all diſgrace. For out of that place, which thou hadſt thought, to be full of reſt and ſecuritie, very often great calamities, and moſt bitter bluſtring ſtormes, in the turning of an hand ſuddenly do ariſe. Séeing therfore, that theſe things ſtand ſo, we ought not to put any confidence in deceiueable dignities, nor to be proud of them: neither muſt we truſt, in the vncertaine riches of this world, which are daily changing, but we muſt flie to our redéemer &amp; onely ſauiour Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; place our whole hope, and ſettle all our confidence in his infinite and endles mercies. God giue vs grace to do ſo.
               Amen.
            
            
               EVen as the eagle is caried vp on high, and falleth not vpon17 the ground, but to ſéeke his neceſſarie foode, and hauing caught his pray, by and by flieth vp againe, and maketh no

abode below on the earth: So we ought to haue our mindes occupied in heauen, and all ſuperfluous care of worldly things laid apart, with the eies of our mindes and faith, to behold our God, and in the quietnes and ſtaiednes of our ſoules, reſt our ſelues vpon his grace, without hauing more to do with this world, than in our ſeuerall callings, to ſéeke lawfully thoſe neceſſaries onely, which may ſerue for the preſeruation of life. Which had, we ſhould in the meditation of our mindes, and the thoughts of our harts, with all our powers flie vnto our God. The apoſtle Paule his counſell is excéeding good: Hauing meate and drinke, and1. Timoth. 6. wherewith we may be clothed, let vs be therewith contented, for they that will be rich, do fall into tentation, and into the ſnare of the diuell.
               And Salomon making his praiers vnto God, hath theſe words:Prouerb. 30. Giue me (O Lord) onely neceſſaries for my life, leaſt if I be too full, I may be drawen to denie thée. And againe:
               Better is a little with the feare of the Lord, than great andProuerb. 15. inſaciable treaſures. Dauid alſo:
               Better is a little that the righteous man hath, than the greatPſalm. 36. riches of the vngodly.
            
            
               EVen as thicke and blacke cloudes, do obſcure and darken18 the bright and glittering ſtars: So degenerating poſterities, and ſuch as be polluted and blemiſhed with trecherie and iniquitie, do diſhonor their anceſtors, and do extinguiſh the cléere light of their noble vertues, and do put vpon them the vgly darkſomnes of their owne vices: that although they be noble men by birth and diſcent, yet they fall into obliuion, and by little and little are quite forgotten. It is better, that a man be renowmed and nobled, by his owne noble acts and excellent vertues, than to depend vpon the nobilitie of his anceſtors. They ought not to be called the ſonnes of noble men, which pleaſe themſelues with vanities, and do wallow in ignominie and wickednes, but the ſonnes of thoſe wicked ones, whoſe kinde of life they do imitate, and whoſe footſteps they follow.
               Chriſt called the wicked Iewes, which ſaid they had Abraham
                  Ioan. 8. to their father, the children of the diuell. And ſpeaking of Chriſtians he ſaith: And how many ſoeuer did receiue him, heIoan. 1. gaue them power to be made the ſonnes of God. In Chriſt Ieſu (ſaith the apoſtle) neither circumciſion auaileth any thing, neitherGalat.

               AS the pleaſant and ſwéete riuer of Iordan, when it runneth19 into Aſphaltites that bitter poole of Paleſtina, is alſo made bitter &amp; vnwholſome, &amp; loſeth the vertue thereof: So, that man, which ioineth himſelfe in friendſhip, and doth couple himſelfe in familiaritie, with wicked and vngodly men, becommeth wicked and vngodly himſelfe, and is ſtained and blemiſhed with their vices, although héertofore he had béen inclined to vertue and godlines. It is therefore pithily ſaid of Eccleſiaſticus: Depart fromEccleſ 7. the wicked, and euill things will depart from thée. And the apoſtle in the fift of the firſt to the Corinthians, &amp; alſo in that to the1. Corinth. 5. Galath. 5. Galath. ſaith: A little leauen doth ſower a whole lump of dowe.
            
            
               AS of neceſſitie, a ſhadow doth accompany thoſe that walk20 in the ſunne ſhine: So is enuie a continuall companion, to thoſe, that in good and honeſt things, do excell others, and are aduanced and renowmed with the beſt. There is no felicitie (ſaith Valerius Maximus) be it in neuer ſo good meaſure and modeſtie, which can eſchew the gnarling and gnawing téeth of enuie. One demanded of a learned man, how he might auoid enuious perſons: If (ſaith he) thou ſhalt haue no excellent thing in thée, and ſhalt do nothing fortunately. Enuie is alway vertues companion, and is euer at the héeles of them, which in honeſtie, vertue, and godlines go beyond others. Miſerie onely admitteth no enuie.
            
            
               EVen as the inferiour planet, ſhadoweth and ecclipſeth the21 planet that is aboue it, but the higher, not the lower: So, men without honeſtie, indued with no wiſedome, not acquainted with vertue, and enimies to true godlines, do their greateſt endeuour, to diſtaine the commendation, and deſerued honor, of notable and very woorthie men. Iob calleth him a littleIob. 5. one, or a man of no valure, that is tormented with grudging and repining againſt the welfare of others. An enuious man, is as vnprofitable to a citie, as darnell is to wheate.
            
            
               AS ruſtineſſe conſumeth iron: ſo enuie conſumeth the enuious22 man: enuious perſons are mightily tormented, at the proſperitie of a ſuperior, bicauſe they cannot match

him: and they greatly diſdaine an inferior, leaſt he ſhould ouertake them: and they cannot abide their equals, for their equalitie ſake. Learned Baſill and Bernard, do compare an enuious perſon with a viper, for as ſhe conceiueth hir yoong one, which (as they report) is brought foorth, with the breaking of the belly of hirdam, and vtterly killing hir bréeder: So the enuious man conceiueth that enuie, which gnaweth and teareth in péeces himſelfe, and worketh his owne ruine, and vtter deſtruction.
            
            
               ENuie is a picture, or a reſemblance of hell: it is a great loſſe23 without any gaine or aduantage: it is a dangerous dammage, without one dram of commoditie. Curſed Cain, ſetGeneſ. 3. forward with the ſtinging goades, and ſmarting pricks of enuie, did kill Abel his good and gracious brother. And the ſonnes of Iacob, in their hot burning enuie, ſold Ioſeph their innocent andGeneſ. 35. beſt brother. Saule in like maner, being through enuie almoſt beſide1. Sam. 18. himſelfe, ſought by all meanes, to take away the life, of holy and faithfull Dauid. We are taught in the booke of Wiſedome,Sapient. 2. that through the enuie of the diuell, death entred into the world. This euil and dangerous diſeaſe is very buſie in theſe our daies: to enuie ſuperiors, to ſpeake euill of men in authoritie, to backbite and ſlander them, which ſéeke the vnitie and the peace of the church, and to condemne thoſe that hunger and thirſt after the aduancement of Gods glorie, and the frée paſſage of the Goſpell of Chriſt. The Lord amend it.
            
            
               AS a ſtaffe made of a réede, is hollow and emptie: So the24 confidence and truſt, which we put in this world, is vaine and will deceiue vs. Therefore the Lord commanded the people of Iſrael, by the prophet Eſay, that they ſhould not go downe into Egypt for refuge, and doth denounce the deſtruction of thoſe that would flie thither, in theſe words: We be to them,Eſay. 31. which go downe into Egypt to ſéeke for helpe there. And againe: Thou doſt truſt vpon a ſtaffe of a réede, and the ſame broken, thatEſay. 36. is, vpon Egypt, &amp;c. it will deceiue thée. Euen ſuch is the helpe of man, whereunto infinite thouſands of people, deſpiſing and forſaking God, do moſt earneſtly flie. But let vs leane vpon, andExod. 7. Exod. 14. truſt to the rod of our God, which deuoured the rods of the Egyptians, and diuided the red ſea into two parts, whereof Dauid ſpeaketh: Thy rod &amp; thy ſtaffe, O Lord, they haue comforted me.Pſalm. 23.
               
            
            
               
               EVen as learned and ſkilfull phyſitions, with the bitter potions,25 and ſharpe medicines, which they miniſter vnto their patients, do mixe ſome ſwéete and pleaſant thing, to win thoſe that be ſicke, the more willingly to receiue them: So preachers of the word of God, being learned and godly wiſe, ought (if néede be) to temper their bitter and rough reprehenſions, with a ſwéet and comfortable doctrine, and ſo of ſharpnes and mildnes, to make a ſoueraigne and holſome medicine, to heale the ſpirituall griefes and diſeaſes of their hearers. For in all things that are done and ſpoken, a meaſure kéeping, and temperance muſt be vſed, and conſideration muſt be had, what is fit for the time, and agréeable to the perſons, and what in all our words and actions doth beſéeme or miſbeſe

               EVen as many men, are much delighted with muſicke, and27 will moſt gladly heare muſitions, make ſongs of the noble acts, and ſingular vertues of many men, but neuer care to imitate one vertue of a thouſand, which they heare, with praiſes extolled vnto the ſkies: So very many men in theſe our daies, are outwardly very forward, to heare ſermons, and the word preached, and as Ananias, will be willingly, to ſée to, at ſome coſt to maintaine preachers, and all is (in many) but méere hypocriſie, to pleaſe their owne humors, with ſome ſtrange and new matter, with ſome Logike, Rethorike, and brauerie of words, which they looke for, without any purpoſe, to frame their liues, after ſuch doctrine as the preacher deliuereth.
            
            
               AS bées paſſing ouer other things, take pleaſure only in flowers,28 and forſaking the reſt, do crop them: So, ſome hearers of the word preached, do only deſire to haue their eares fed, with fine phraſes, delicate flowers of eloquence, daintie ſimilies, pretie compariſons, and pleaſant hiſtories, as for ſound doctrine, they contemne it, and hate to haue it, a bridle for their luſts, a reproouer of their vanities, and a glaſſe to ſée themſelues in, they

ſéeke after flatteries and fables, and they loath the truth, which ſhould do them good. The holy apoſtle foreſéeing this, ſaid: The2. Timoth. 4. time will come, when they will not abide wholſome doctrine, but after their owne luſts, will gather to themſelues teachers, &amp; hauing itching eares, will be turned into fables. And we read in the Acts of the Apoſtles, that the Athenians applied themſelues to nothing elſe, but to heare, and to learne newes. And yetAct. 17. notwithſtanding, though the caſe ſtand thus in our time, the preachers of the word, ought not to giue ouer their faithfull labours in teaching, but rather to be the more diligent, carefull, and feruent. For although, there be many curious, vaine and idle hearers of their doctrine, yet there be many graue, learned, and godly ones, which ſéeke onely the good of their ſoules, and the comfort of their conſciences. And if there were among a thouſand, onely one that loued and ſought the truth, for that one ſake the truth of God, ought to be preached. That ſame excellent ſaying of the famous Poet Antimachus, is well woorth the remembring: who, when he read his booke to all his ſchollers called togither, and all (ſauing Plato) forſooke him, before he had ended his reading: I will (ſaith he) go forward, and reade on, for Plato is to me, as much as all the reſt.
            
            
               AS phyſitions do oftentimes cut off a rotten member, leaſt29 it corrupt and putrifie the other members: So it behooueth men of authoritie, if they will preſerue the commonwealth in ſafetie, to roote out of it, all thoſe, that do giue themſelues, euen with gréedines, to beaſtly behauiour, and to rotten conditions, as theft, adulterie, fornication, murther, blaſphemie, trecherie, treaſon, and ſuch like: leaſt the rotten ones, deſtroy them that be ſound, and the brutiſhly minded, ſtaine thoſe that be of chaſte conuerſation, and the wicked and rebellious crew, draw the better ſort to diſobedience. Solon ſaid wiſely, that ASolon. common wealth is maintained, and vpholden with two things, to wit, with due reward, and due puniſhment. For as it behooueth, to reward well, thoſe that be profitable members, and ſuch as do liue in the feare of God, and due obedience: ſo it is no leſſe neceſſarie, and néedfull, to giue vnto the wicked their deſerued puniſhment.
            
            
               EVen as the moone is not ecclipſed, nor loſeth any light, but30 when it is at the full: So men are woont, then chiefly to be

                  ncerning the loue of God and their neighbours, when they be full of riches, and do abound with worldly wealth.
            
            
               ANd as the moone, when ſhe is at the full, is fartheſt from31 the ſunne, of whom ſhe hath hir light: So, many of thoſe men, which do flowe on euery ſide, with the goodes and riches of this world, do euen then in the middeſt of their wealth, withdrawe themſelues fartheſt from God, from whom themſelues, and all their treaſures, and whatſoeuer, haue their being. And although, ſome vertues now and then, do ſéeme to make, a ſhew in them, yet through the cares of this world, and the deſire of riches, they be quite ouerthrowen and vtterly buried.

Alſo Auguſtine, that ancient and graue teacher ſaith: Haſt thou gotten riches? then haſt thou loſt quietnes.
            
            
               HE that is adorned, and well furniſhed, with many and32 great vertues, although he be a very poore man, concerning this world, yet is he to be honored. For as pretious ſtones, though they be caſt into the mire, yet they loſe not their beautie, nature, and propertie: So men indued with honeſtie, repleniſhed with goodly vertues, and well acquainted with the true worſhipping, of the moſt high and gracious God, although they be ſilent, as men in their graues, and are had in contempt of the world, yet haue they not loſt their dignitie, and the true honor proper to Chriſtians, which conſiſteth not in the wealth and renowine of this world, but in holines, in righteouſnes, and in the faithfull imitation of Chriſt. Godly men are great men, though the world make no reckoning of them, and wickedmen, are vile and baſe men, although the world ſet and place them, in the heighth and top of all honor. Nothing is higher, nothing loftier, than vnfained vertue. There is nothing lower, nothing baſer, nothing 
                     •
                  iler than vice. Whereſoeuer is a iuſt man, there is

a great and mightie man, and whereſoeuer is a wicked man, there is a man of no account, with God and his ſaints.
            
            
               AS a little image, though it be ſet vpon an high mountaine,33 is notwithſtanding a little one ſtill: and on the other ſide, if Coloſſus that huge and mightie image, be placed in a very lowe vally, yet loſeth not his bignes: So a wicked and curſed man, that is fraught with ſundrie vices, though he floriſh in honor and riches, yet is he but a ſeely meane man: and on the other ſide, a man that is vertuous and godly wiſe, although he be in extreme pouertie and beggerly eſtate, yet out of doubt he is a great man, and to be highly accounted of. And certainly it were an excellent change betwéene theſe two, if the good poore man, had the honor and the riches of the wicked man, and he the pouertie and beggerlines of the good man.
            
            
               EVen as a cloud darkeneth the aire, and couereth the ſunne:34 So, calamitie and miſerie, maketh cloudie the mind of man, and taking from him all his ioy, it leaueth him bare and naked, without comfort, and full of ſorrow.
            
            
               AS a wall all whited on the out ſide, is not eaſily perceiued,35 whether it be made of ſtone, or of clay, vnleſſe it be ſmitten, and tried with a mallet, or ſome other inſtrument: So, a man garniſhed outwardly with good things to ſée to, is not by and by iudged, and preſently diſcerned, whether he be a man of patience, of charitie, and other vertues, vnles he firſt be ſmitten, and tried with the mallet or béetle, of obloquies, ſlanders, afflictions, troubles and temptations. The apoſtle Paule made anſwere to one, that would ſhadow his wickednes, with a cloke of vertue: God will ſmite thée thou painted wall.Act. 23.
               
            
            
               AS thoſe things which agrée not with our nature, and haue36 no proportion with it, as fire, ſulphure, and ſuch other things, if we ſhould eate them, would not onely not profit vs, but would alſo hurt and kill vs: So, the deceitfull riches of this world, too much deſired and ſought for, the pompe of honor, vaine glorie, and ſuch like, after the which, very many do run to too earneſtly, do not onely not nouriſh the ſoules of men to eternall life, nor mitigate and appeaſe the wicked luſts of the ſame,

but alſo do bring vpon them euerlaſting wo, with vtter and endleſſe deſtruction. The foode beſt agréeing with the ſoule of man, is vertue, the propertie whereof is, aboue all things to loue God, to wiſh for him, to ſticke to him, to feare nothing but him, and for his ſake, to deſpiſe this world, and al the traſh of the ſame, and in him, and for his ſake, to loue them, that hate vs, to féede them, that would hunger-ſtarue vs, and to ſaue the liues of them that would kill vs. Riches, dignities and honors, may be poſſeſſed and holden without ſinne, but the gréedy coueting of them, and ambition, which the apoſtle calleth the roote of all euils, without great ſinne, cannot be holden.1. Timoth. 6.
               
            
            
               EVen as the bough of a trée, the fuller it is of fruit, the waightier37 it is, and the greater and more plentiful fruit it beareth, the lower it falleth: So the wiſer a man is, the more humble he is, and the more he is loden with the fruits of wiſedome, the lower he ſtoupeth, and humbleth himſelfe the more: but the proud man, like a fruitleſſe and barren bough, lifteth his head on high, not ſéeking the profit and good of his ſoule, but the idle praiſes of men, and the vaine glory of the world. Thus is it, that the proud man, comming to the ſacred and moſt holy ſcriptures, there he worketh his owne woe, and as it were ſuppeth vp his remedileſſe deſtruction. For it is that holy mountaine, wherevnto if any ſhall come, in the likenes of a man, &amp; ſhall bring withExod. 19. him the life of a beaſt, he ſhall be ſtoned to death: and where he might haue furniſhed, and ſtored himſelfe, with true and heauenly wiſedome, if he had come vnto the holy word, in humility, reuerence, and with an hart and minde well prepared, from thence he carrieth his owne vndoubted, and moſt certaine death, and helpeleſſe damnation: bicauſe he would with his owne arrogancie and ſwelling pride, pearce into the déepe ſecrets, and hidden myſteries, of the oracles of God. Of ſuch ſpeaketh Salomon in his Prouerbs: He that will be a ſearcher out of God his maieſtie,Prouerb. 25. ſhall be ouerwhelmed of his glorie.
            
            
               EVen as, if any man would ſtéedily looke vpon the bright38 ſphere of the ſunne, he ſhould become blinde, bicauſe the weake ſight of his eies, is not able to abide ſo great a brightnes: So, whoſoeuer, truſting to his owne wit, ſhall caſt the eies of his minde, vpon the woonderfull and vnſpeakable

brightnes, of the ſecrets of God, he ſhall be ouerthrowen of the ſame, and the ſight of his minde being blinded and put out, he ſhall neuer attaine to that, which he would: bicauſe the great and hidden myſteries of the moſt high God, cannot be comprehended, by mans wit being puffed vp with pride, or elſe there ſhould be no difference betwéene God and man, if man of himſelfe, could attaine vnto, the ſecrets of Gods eternall maieſtie ſealed vp in his bleſſed word, and not to be opened, but by the mightie power of his moſt holy ſpirit. So much did thoſe thingsExod. 40. 1. Reg. 6. &amp; 8. ſignifie which were in ſanctis ſanctorum hid and couered.
               
                  Paule, perhaps, leaning &amp; truſting to his owne wit, before he receiued the faith of Chriſt, would pearce into Gods myſteries, but comming far ſhort of his purpoſe, he wandred in a great and dangerous error, and would néeds (being inflamed with hatred) euen kil thoſe Chriſtians with the ſword, whom he ought not to haue wounded or vexed with a word. But a light from heauenAct. 9. compaſſed him about, and falling to the ground, he ſaw nothing, &amp; yet his eies open, as before, wherby his former diſpoſition was ſignified: but afterward when he did caſt downe and truly humble himſelfe, and all his pride laid apart, came to Ananias, he receiued his ſight. And in that his humilitie he ſaid: I am the1. Cor. 15. leaſt of the apoſtles, which am not woorthie to be called an apoſtle, bicauſe I perſecuted the Church of God. Dauid ſaith: ThePſal. 25. Lord openeth his ſecrets incloſed in his word to thoſe that feare him. In which words our God promiſeth, that he will vnfold and reueale, to godly and humble men of hart, the ſecrets and priuities of his holy oracles. Vpon whom ſhall I looke (ſaith theEſay. 66. Lord) but vpon the ſillie poore man, that is contrite in hart, and trembleth at my words?

               THou ſhalt ſée ſomtimes in the aire, a cloud hauing the figure39 and likenes of a tall and mightie man, which by and by is ſpred abroad and repreſenteth huge and high towers: but in the turning of an hand, being taken with a blaſt of winde, it is diſſolued and vaniſheth away: Euen ſuch is the truſt, that we put in this tranſitorie world.

Iohn the ſeruant of God did well conſider of this, when he gaue this1. Ioan. 2. counſell: Loue not the world, nor thoſe things that be in the world: the world paſſeth away, and the luſt of the ſame. And Paule ſaith: The ſhape of this world paſſeth away: he ſaith not,1. Cor. 7. the ſubſtance of this world, but the ſhape paſſeth away. If then this world muſt néedes paſſe away, and returne to it nothing againe, if that we take to be a ſubſtance, be but a ſhape, thinke we then, that our life, our hope, our riches, our pleaſures, ſhall continue? no ſurely. For Iames ſaith: Our life is as a vapour,Iacob. 4. Sapien. 2. appéering for a very ſhort time, and our life is diſſolued as a cloud in the aire.
            
            
               AS our eies, which do behold heauen and earth, and other40 innumerable creatures of God, do not ſée themſelues, but looking in a glaſſe, by that meane, they perfectly ſée themſelues: So we do not ſée and conſider our owne frailtie, and brickle eſtate, but if we will ſet before our eies, the glaſſe of the remembrance of death, and the true knowledge of our ſelues, beholding diligently (I ſay) that cléere glaſſe, we cannot chooſe but very plainly ſée our ſelues and what we be.

Indéed it is a true glaſſe, it wil not flatter nor deceiue vs: it will tel vs that we be but duſt, and that we ſhall againe returne to duſt. Iames ſéemeth to ſay plainly to vs thus: Know your ſelues, and leaſt ye be deceiued, behold your ſelues in the glaſſe of truth, which is the perfect law of libertie. Sée what thou art, and what thou ſhalt be. Remember that thou art a man, and conſequently duſt and aſhes.

                  Auguſtine that learned teacher, ſaith well: Before thou waſt man, thou waſt earth: and before thou waſt earth, thou waſt nothing.

ſhe deſireth to go out, and ſtriueth to haue hir libertie, and in hir eager and earneſt deſire to be gone, ſhe doth oftentimes thruſt hir bill through the loupes of the cage: So the ſoule of a vertuous man, inflamed with an vnfained loue of God, being ſhut vp and holden in the coupe of his bodie, although he abound with all neceſſaries, fit for the preſeruation of this temporall life, yet moſt earneſtly deſireth, to depart hence, and to go to his countrie, which is heauen. And in token that he would faine go thither, he fetcheth many a déepe ſigh, and many a gréeuous grone, and doth full often craue of his creator, with his chéekes all to bedewed, and ſmeared with the teares of his eies, that, this exilement being finiſhed, he might reſt for euer, in that happie and holy houſe of bleſſed ſoules, where he may haue the fruition of his God, and euerlaſting life through Ieſus Chriſt his onely ſauiour and redéemer. Euery Chriſtian man, although he haue wealth at will, and haue ſtately and roiall houſes, glittering and floriſhing with Iuorie and golde, yet ought he to aſpire towards heauen, and in hart and deſire, to flie towards his beſt countrie, ſaying with the Apoſtle: I would faine remooue hence, and go2.

               EVen as vipers do eate out, and teare in péeces the bellies of42 their bréeders, that themſelues may get out: So, not the Iewes onely, but the Papiſts alſo, do mangle and teare in péeces the law of God, and do rent, and corrupt the words and doctrine of the holy prophets of God, euen as it were a belly, and bowels, that they may créepe out, and eſcape from a liuely, perfect and a ſauing faith, and they may be confirmed in their errors, hereſies, and infidelitie. Yea, as the Iewes, haue from time to time, ſlain the gracious and wiſe prophets of God, euen ſo the Papiſts now, where they beare any ſway, of rule and authoritie, do moſt cruelly torment and murther the ſaints of God.
            
            
               EVen as the delicate ballance of a goldſmith is mooued with43 euery little weight, ſo that with one graine laid vpon it, it falleth downward: So, with euery thing, whether it bée luckie or vnfortunate, we are woont to be greatly mooued, and do ſuddenly change our purpoſes: ſomtime we excéede in mirth, by and by we are ouerwhelmed with ſorrow: we are euen now

praiſing men to the ſkies: and preſently we hurle them downe from heauen, with our toongs, and thruſt them into hell. We loue men, and hate them: we ſaue men, and kill them, all with one breth: now we chooſe vertue, and by and by vice. Thus doth mans will obey his vnbrideled luſt.

Therefore ſaith the kingly prophet Dauid: Bleſſed is the man, whoſe delight is in the law of God, and inPſalm. 1. that law, doth meditate day and night. He ſaith not, that that man is happie and bleſſed, which heareth and readeth the word: but he pronounceth him to be happie, which doth practiſe the ſame in the courſe of his life, and doth digeſt it in the ſtomacke of his vnderſtanding, and endeuoreth himſelfe with all diligence to obey it, and ſhal ſpend daies and nights in the meditation thereof. And the Lord by Ezechiel ſaith: Thou ſonne of man eate thisEzech. 3. booke. And againe: Thy belly and thy bowels ſhall be filled with this booke. Very many do eat the word of God, and yet remaine emptie: many do take it, whoſe bowels (that is, their harts and minds) are not filled with it, bicauſe in very ſhort time, either they do forget it, or elſe they apply it rather to a vaine curioſitie, than to the profit and good of their ſoules: neither do they obſerue

thoſe things, which they know, in their conſciences, by the inſtruction of the word, ought to be obſerued. Such a thing did the Lord obiect againſt the vnthankfull Iewes, by Aggeus the prophet: Ye haue ſowe

                   much, but ye haue inued little: you haueAggae. 1. eaten, but you are not ſatiſfied.

it may hurt vs, and that we may fall from the top of deceitfull and tranſitorie glorie, downe to the bottome, of moſt certaine and perpetuall ignominie.

do bring foorth perilous and peſtilent errors, and are therfore with wiſedome and great diſcretion to be regarded, euen as herbes are to be gathered and vſed. But this wiſedome and diſcretion, is to be ſought for and had, onely in the word of God, which is a lanterne to our féete, and a moſt perfect light vnto ourPſal. 119. pathes. It is onely acceptable, to the ſoules of Gods ſaints, and nothing but it, doth féede them to eternall life. It is ſwéeter vnto them, than hony and the hony combe. In mens iudgements,Pſal. 119. words and works, we may be deceiued, in the Lords we cannot. Thy iudgements O Lord (ſaith Dauid) are iuſt, and more to bePſal. 18. deſired than fine golde, or pretious ſtones, and they are ſwéeter than hony and the hony combe. It is the power of ſaluation toRom. 1. Iam. 3. all that beléeue it: it is able to ſaue our ſoules, if it be throughly rooted in vs. The word of the Lord laid vp in our harts, doth preſerue vs from ſinne: it clenſeth our harts, and by the working ofPſal. 119. the holy Ghoſt with it, it createth right ſpirits within vs. By the meanes of it, the ſaints and ſeruants of God, attaine to that puritie and cleannes of hart and minde, that they wiſh for and deſire nothing, but that which is good, godly, and holy. The author of the word is God himſelfe, who can neither deceiue, nor be deceiued: and therefore whatſoeuer is written in it, is truth: whatſoeuer is taught in it, is vertue and holines: whatſoeuer it promiſeth after death, is eternitie, and endleſſe ioy to the children of God, when this life is ended. Whereto the Lord bring vs all, if it be his good pleaſure.

This the Lord commandeth to be cloſed, and ſafely laid vp, in the cofer of our harts, and to be worne as a ſigne vponDeut. 6.

Salomon doth counſell vs, to binde it faſt to our harts, andProuerb. 6. to vſe it as a chaine about our necks, and to take it with vs, when we walke abroad. And Chriſt himſelfe ſaith: If any man loueIohn. 14.

The apoſtle alſo: Not the hearers of the law are righteous before God, but the doers of the lawe ſhall be iuſtified. And Iames ſaith: Be ye doers of the word, andIam. 1. not hearers onely, deceiuing your owne ſelues. The Lord giue grace, and his holy ſpirit vnto vs, that we may loue to heare his word, and to do his will.
            
            
               EVen as doues do loue, and delight in houſes, that be faire57 whited, and do willingly frequent ſwéete and pleaſant places, but contemne and flie from blacke, foule, and vnſauorie cottages: So, faithles and vntruſtie friends, do hunt and ſéeke after, the friendſhip of thoſe men, by whoſe wealth and riches, they may be holpen, reléeued, and enriched. But men in pouertie, and diſtreſſed perſons, vnable to fill their bellies, to clothe their backs, or otherwiſe to pleaſure them, with ſome worldly things, they vtterly deſpiſe, they care not for their companie, their loue, nor friendſhip, feare they God neuer ſo much. Yea, if ſome bluſtering ſtorme, and terrible tempeſt of aduerſitie ſhall blowe away thy wealth, and ſhall ſeparate thy riches and thy ſelfe: thy greateſt friends (as thou thoughteſt) will hide them from thée,Prouerb. 17. and no where be found: but a faithfull friend loueth at al times, he neuer ſhrinketh, aduerſitie and proſperitie is all one to him.

               AS great and mighty fiſhes, are not bred and fed in ſmall58 riuers, and ſwéet waters, but in the ſalt and bitter waters of the ſeas: So, men that are excellent, and very famous, by reaſon of the notable and manifolde vertues, wherewith they be indued, are not delighted in the falſe and deceitfull pleaſures of this world, but are nouriſhed, and as it were ſwéetely cheriſhed, and brought vp in Chriſt, with very ſower ſorrowes, and bitter calamities, which they endure, and moſt patiently beare for Gods ſake. And as to a valiant ſoldier, nothing is more noble, and woorthie praiſe, than to carry the armour and armes of his prince: So a true Chriſtian man, eſtéemeth nothing of greater valure and more honorable, than to beare the armes and badges of Chriſt his captaine, that is, to be throughly touched with great croſſes, and many afflictions, and to be well armed with a godly patience. Heare the Apoſtle, that ſtout and valiant

ſoldier of Chriſt: I do beare in my body the marks of the LordGalat. 6. 2. Tim. 3. Ieſu. Yea he ſaith further: All that will liue godly in Chriſt Ieſu, ſhall ſuffer perſecutions. Séeing Chriſt our head, and onely ſauiour, ſuffered perſecutions, what maruell, if we his members ſuffer them? The holy ſcripture calleth calamities and perſecutions, yea and death it ſelfe, indured in the quarrell of God, and his truth, a cup. Dauid prepared himſelfe to receiue this cup: I will receiue the cup of ſaluation, and will call vpon the name ofPſal. 116. the Lord: and expreſſing what this cup is, he ſaith: Right déere in the ſight of the Lord, is the death of his ſaints.
               Chriſt hath his cup, and the world his: the cup of Chriſt hath very bitter drink in it, but very wholſome. The cup of the world, is gold to ſée to, and is ful of pleaſures within, but moſt peſtilent and deadly, it pleaſeth the ſenſes, and killeth the ſoule.
            
            
               AS a phyſition doth miniſter to his ſicke patients, ſower60 and bitter potions to drinke, that ſome hurtfull humor of their bodies may be expelled: So, God our heauenly phyſition, willing to cure the maladies, and to ſalue the ſores of our ſoules, doth reach vnto vs many times, the cup of afflictions, troubles and miſeries, that (our ſins and iniquities being taken away) we may be reſtored to the former ſaluation of our ſoules. The world doth offer vnto vs a very beautifull cup, but it is full of deadly poiſon, it delighteth our eies and taſte, but it worketh moſt ſurely our ouerthrow and vtter deſtruction. This is that cup, that Iohn in the Reuelation, biddeth vs to beware of: the Lord giue vs grace to ſhun it, for he ſaith, it is full of all abhominationApoc. 17. and vncleannes. Let vs chéerefully receiue the cup of Chriſt, that is, pouertie, penurie, obloquies, euill reports, backbitings, ſlanders, perſecutions, ſicknes and death it ſelfe: this is very ſharpe and vnpleaſant to our taſte at the firſt, but at the length moſt wholſome to our infected and ſicke ſoules.
            
            
               A Good bailife of huſbandrie, when he ſéeth plentifull fruits61 grow after his faithfull labours, deſireth that his lord or maſter may come, that ſéeing his diligence, and fidelitie in his calling, he may reward him for his trauel and paines taken: And a valiant ſoldier, after dangerous fight, and noble victorie gotten, wiſheth the preſence of his prince, that he vpon the view and ſight of the ſweate of his browes, his grieuous wounds, and

courage, may recompence the noble acts that he hath done: So, that man which hath faithfully handled, the huſbandrie, and bailywike, committed to him of the Lord, and hath manfully fought, againſt the world, fleſh, and ſathan, and through the grace, and mightie ſpirit of God, hath gotten the vpper hand, and victorie of them all, he now moſt earneſtly deſireth, that Chriſt his captaine, vnder whoſe banner he hath fought, would come, that he might receiue his reward, which is euerlaſting ioy in heauen, and eternall ſaluation through Chriſt, with God, his angels and ſaints for euer and euer. Which though it be called a reward, yet is it the frée gift of God, vtterly vndeſerued of man, but onely deſerued and purchaſed for vs by Chriſt Ieſu, in his death and paſſion vpon the croſſe, and to all that do beléeue in him, it is frée. But on the other ſide: the wicked and vngodly, whoſe delight is onely in the pleaſures, and peſtilent flickerings of the world, which do ſwallow vp vanities euen with gréedines, and ſet at naught all vertue and godlines: which are ſhut vp vnder iniquitie, and become ſlaues vnto ſinne: which are pricked in their conſciences, and do feare the infernall woes, and terrible torments of hell, which are prepared for them againſt the day of their death, they would not haue Chriſt to come, to heare of his comming is troubleſome and fearfull to them. A guiltie man, whoſe conſcience doth diſquiet him, would neuer ſée the Iudge: a traitor would neuer willingly be ſéene of his prince, nor a diſloyall perſon of one that knoweth him.
            
            
               AS braſſe or copper doth make a greater ſound, and is heard62 farther off than gold, whereas notwithſtanding, gold is far more excellent than it: So eloquence ioined with knowledge, ſoundeth lowder and farther, than humilitie coupled with charitie: and yet ſuch humilitie is far better, and more excellent than it. Knowledge (without humilitie) puffeth vp (ſaith the Apoſtle)1. Cor. 8. 1. Cor. 13. but charitie doth edifie. Againe: If I ſpeake with the toongs of men and of angels, and haue not charitie, I am but as a ſounding braſſe, or a tinkling cimball. A great bragger and boaſter of religion, maketh much noiſe, but an humble ſpirited Chriſtian, is far better than he.

Cor. 16. ſtand ſtedfaſt in the faith of Chriſt, to quit themſelues like men, and to be ſtrong, and to do, all that they do in loue.

Séeing then that all fleſh is graſſe, and all muſt ſée death, but how, when, and where, we cannot tell: it ſtandeth vs vpon, to haue our mindes fixed in heauen, and to be ſeeking thoſe things which are aboue, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God in maieſtie and power, that liuing in his feare, and dying in his faith, we may haue a glorious reſurrection, and méeting him ioyfully in the cloudes, we may heare him moſt cheerefully ſay to vs: Come ye bleſſed children, receiue a kingdome prepared for you, before the foundations of the earth were laid.

And whiles he thus falleth away, and ſtarteth aſide like a broken bowe, he loſeth the light and excellent brightnes of Chriſtian dignitie, vntill he remaine not onely depriued of the light of grace, but alſo blinde in his vnderſtanding, vtterly obſcured, and cleane couered with a moſt palpable darknes. The Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh of ſuch men, ſaying: They are without knowledge, they haue noPſal. 82. vnderſtanding, they walke in darknes. And the holy Apoſtle ſaith: Their fooliſh hart is full of darknes. And againe: WalkeRom. 1. Epheſ. 4. not ye, as the gentils walke, in the vanitie of their mindes, hauing their vnderſtanding darkened.
               But when man groweth in diuine exerciſes, and increaſeth in a heauenly life, and goeth on ſtill in ſpirituall graces, then he turneth his backe to the world, and vtterly renounceth the vanities, the flickerings, the allurements, and all the deceits of the ſame; and turneth the opening of his hart, and all his deſires, to God onely, and ſo goeth on, continually profiting, and euerie day receiuing ſome brightnes, vntill he be filled, not onely with the light of grace, but of glorie alſo. Therefore by how much the more thou ſhalt ſee a man occupied in the vnſaciable deſires of this world, and buſied with the troubleſome affaires of vaine and tranſitorie things, and ſuch as be vnprofitable for his ſoule, by ſo much the more, vnderſtand thou, that he goeth backward, and decaieth in Chriſtian perfection. And on the other ſide, the more feruently, and earneſtly thou ſhalt ſee him, to aſpire to heauenly things, knowe thou, that ſo much the more he profiteth, in the true knowledge, loue, feare, and worſhipping of God. That we therefore may profite in heauenly things, and be illuminated with the bright beames of grace, let vs lift vpwarde our harts to God, let vs ſend to him our deſires, our ſighes and grones, let vs neuer ceaſe begging, but continually craue at his hands, that euerlaſting life, which is onely excellent, onely beſt, and kept in ſtore for all that do truly feare God and walke in hisPſal. 128. waies.
            
            
               
               EVen as a bodie without a ſoule, is dead, bicauſe it vſeth not66 the ſinewes, ioints, nor members: So that common welth, or that citie, may well and truly be ſaid to be dead, where good lawes, godly ſtatutes, and holy ordinances, are not vſed, and put in practiſe, which are the ſure binding bands, of mans ſocietie, and the principall parts of a common wealth. Theſe miſſing, iuſtice is contemned, vertue baniſhed, honeſtie expulſed, and all euill, vice, vilenes, and all ſinne, iniquitie, and abhomination cheriſhed, vpholden and maintained.

If floods and riuers, with great force run into the ſea, bicauſe (asEccleſ. 1. Salomon ſaith) they came out of the ſea: why will not we loue our God, why will we not aſpire towards him? why will we not, in all feruencie of loue drawe néere vnto him, which is that immeaſurable ſea of all goodnes, from whence we came? for he hath made vs after his owne ſimilitude and likenes. As we areGeneſ. 1. bound to kéepe the precepts and commandements of God, ſo are we moſt ſtraitly bound, to loue, honor, and obey himſelfe. Euen as the horſe is ordained to run, the oxe to plough, and the dog to hunt: ſo is man borne, aboue all things, to loue God.
            
            
               AS a ſtone preaſeth to his centre: So an hard harted man is68 preaſing towards hel. It is ſaid of the obſtinate Egyptians: They went downe into the depth like a ſtone. Their bodiesExod. 15. went downe into the bottome of the ſea, and their ſoules into the bottome of hell. And Eccleſiaſticus ſaith: An hard hart ſhallEccleſ. 3. fare euill at the laſt. God grant therefore that euery one of vs may iuſtly ſay, as Iob ſaith of himſelfe: The Lord hath mollifiedIob. 23. my hart. It is written in the bookes of Exodus &amp; Numbers: thatExod. 17. Numb. 20. 
                  Moſes did ſmite the rocke with his rod, and that abundance of water flowed out. Vnto which words the prophet Dauid alludeth, ſaying: He ſmote the rocke, and the waters guſhed out, ſo that riuers did run thereat. The Lord ſo ſmite our ſtonie harts, with the rod of the croſſe of Chriſt, and of the remembrance of his bitter paſſion, and ſo breake in péeces the hard rocks of the

ſame, that floods of moſt bitter teares may run from our eies, and many déepe ſighes, and gréeuous grones, may fal from our harts to mooue the Lord, to waſh away all our ſinnes, and rebellions againſt the Almightie, in and with the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, our only ſauiour and redéemer.

               EVen as the grape, that it may yéeld wine, is brought to the70 preſſe, that it may be throughly preſſed: So man, is brought to calamity, that being preſſed with ſorrowes, and exerciſed with afflictions, he may bring foorth the ſwéete and pleaſant liquor of obedience and vertue, and ſo be aduanced to true Chriſtianitie, which is the greateſt and higheſt dignitie in the world. Miſeries, penuries, and tribulations, do, for the moſt part, kéepe vnder and ſtay, our vnruly luſts, and dangerous deſires, and are meanes, that we lift vp our harts and mindes vnto God, and that we be ſtrengthened and confirmed, in true pietie and vnfained godlines. And on the other ſide, proſperitie, worldly wealth, dignitie and honors, are oftentimes, meanes to hinder vs, in holy exerciſes, and to puffe vs vp, with pride and vaine glorie, and to drawe vs to diſloyaltie, and rebellion againſt our God. The Iſraelites being ſtoong and torne of firie ſerpents, they learned to knoweNumb. 21. God, and cried for his mercie. And wicked Manaſſes, being caſt into the bands of the Babylonians, and compaſſed round about with great calamities, he fled vnto the Lord, he acknowledged2. Paral. 33. his ſinnes, ſending vnto the Lord moſt feruent praiers, and the Lord heard him.

                  Dauid ſaith: The earth is the Lords, and all the fulnesPſal. 24. thereof, the round world, and they that dwell therein: if we do obey him, and ſerue him faithfully, and giue vnto him his due honor, he commandeth the earth, his ancient ſteward, to miniſter vnto vs, great ſtore of neceſſaries, and to giue vnto vs, all good, rich, and pleaſant things in due time: but on the other ſide, if we diſobey him, rebel againſt him, and be not afraid to do thoſe things, which he forbiddeth vs, and will commit, we care not what ſin, euen with gréedines, ioy, and delight; then he commandeth his ſteward the earth, to denie foode vnto vs, and to afflict vs with penurie, and extreme want, of all thoſe things, whereof it was woont to yéeld vs great abundance, and not to be ſo bold, as to reléeue or comfort vs, vntill we be conuerted, and flie vnto him, confeſſing and acknowledging our ſinnes, from the bottome of our harts, and moſt bitterly bewailing them, ſhall proſtrate our ſelues before the throne of grace, crauing and crying, for remiſſion of our ſinnes, in the death and bloodſhedding of our ſauiour Chriſt crucified.

If thou wilt bend thy ſelfe to obedience, and to a vertuous and godly life, thou ſhalt euer haue him, a ſtrong rocke, whereupon thou maiſt boldly build: a caſtell and tower of defence: he will be vnto thée a mighty pillor, bearing vp heauen and earth, whereto thou maiſt leane, and not be deceiued, wherein thou maieſt truſt, and not be diſappointed: he will euer be at thy right hand, that thou ſhalt not fall: he will take thy part, andPſal. 16. will mightily defend thee, againſt all thine enimies, of thy bodie and of thy ſoule: But if thou wilt ſhake hands with vertue, and bid it adew and farewell, and forſaking the waies of God, wilt liue as thou liſt, and follow thine owne corruption, and make no conſcience of ought thou doeſt, defiling and blemiſhing thy ſelfe, with all maner ſinne and iniquitie; then be ſure, the

Lord will appeere vnto thee, in his furie and indignation, from whoſe iuſtice and iudgements none ſhall euer be able to deliuer thée: the Lord therefore giue vs harts, to feare him, to loue him, and to obey him.

And ſuch is the iar and diſcord, betwéene this world and him, that being placed in the world, he ſuffereth it not (ſo much as in him lieth) to bewitch men, and to drawe them after it. But if the world (like a load ſtone) ſhall at any timeA vertuous man, is a pretious iewell. allure them to follow it, he by and by bendeth himſelfe, with all his force, by counſell, by admonitions, by his life and example, to drawe them backe againe from it, and to reſtore them to their former dignitie, that is, to the eſtimation and honor of true chriſtianitie, wherto the world and worldlings are méere ſtrangers.

Theſe men care not to do well, and yet they ſéeke for, and deſire the rewards of well doing. They haue no eie, nor regard to God in any of their actions. They are not to be imitated at any hand. Chriſt himſelfe doth giue vs warning of ſuch: Be ye not likeMatth▪ 6.
                  
vnto hypocrites, &amp;c. But let vs do as the holy prophet of God doth teach vs: I (ſaith he) haue ſet the Lord alwaies before mine eies,Pſal. 16. he is at my right hand, that I ſhall not be mooued. Whatſoeuer he thought, ſpoke or did, he ſtill behaued himſelfe, as one in the preſence and ſight of God, and ſought the glorie and praiſe of his name, in all his actions. So ought we to do, the Lord grant we may. This alſo is the Apoſtles counſell: Whether ye eate or1. Cor. 10. drinke, or whatſoeuer ye do elſe, do all to the glorie of God.
            
            
               AS a thicke wood, and goodly groue, giuing great ſhadowe,76 very pleaſant to behold, doth delight the eies of the beholders ſo greatly, with the varietie and thicknes, of floriſhing trées, and pleaſant plants, that it ſéemeth to be ordained onely for pleaſures ſake, and yet within is full of poiſonful ſerpents, rauening wolues, and other wilde, hurtfull, and cruell beaſts: Euen ſo, an hypocrite when outwardly he ſéemeth holy, and to be wel furniſhed with the ornaments of all ſorts of vertues, doth pleaſe well, and delight much the eies of his beholders, but within him, there lurketh pride, couetouſnes, enuie, and all maner wickedneſſes, like wilde and cruell beaſts, walking and wandring in the wood of his hart. So that, whiles he ſéemeth to be, that he is not, neither will be that he ſéemeth, his exerciſe is, to ſéeke whoſe houſe he may deuoure, whoſe goodes he may gripe, whoſe credit he may cracke, whoſe name he may blemiſh, and whoſe honeſt diſpoſition, and godly ſimplicity he may moſt abuſe. In the hypocrite this is verified: Fained ſanctitie, is double iniquitie. So that (I ſpeake with reuerence) if any be a knaue, the hypocrite is more: if ſome may ſerue for one, he may well ſtand for two. Hypocriſie is a ſubtill euill, a ſecret poiſon, a lurking venome, a painting and counterfetting of vertue, &amp; a moath of holines. In mine opinion there be no woorſe men liuing, than hypocrites be: for when they purpoſe moſt to deceiue, they handle the matter ſo, and do ſo paint themſelues with counterfet colour, that you would thinke them to be very vertuous, and godly diſpoſed.
            
            
               AS a flint ſmitten againſt iron or ſtéele, doth driue out77 ſparks of fire: So godly meditations of heauenly things, draw out of hard harts, ſome warmnes, and as it were fire of the loue of God. The prophet Dauid had experience thereof,

when he ſaid: My hart wareth warme within me, and in myPſal▪ 39. meditation a fire was kindled. That ſoule which ſhall be repleniſhed with vertues, and ſhal take pleaſure in the contemplation of heauenly things, ſhall (no doubt) haue moſt ſwift and ſpeedie wings, and ſhall be called moſt woorthily, Auis petens alta, ſe à terrae laqueis eripiens: A bird that mounteth on high, and pearſeth the clouds, fréeing hir ſelfe from the traps and ſnares of the earth. Such was the ſoule of the prophet, when he ſaid: My ſoule is euen as a bird, eſcaped out of the ſnare of the hunter. Let vs, whiles it is to day, and we may flie, be lifted vp towards our God: and forgetting the vaine things of the earth, which are behinde vs, and preaſing with all our powers to the things aboue, and neuer ſatiſfied with the loue of God, and the deſire of heauen, let vs boldly go forward, and ſtretch out our ſelues to the reward of the high calling of God, in Chriſt Ieſu our Lord. For the things of this world, haue euer béene falſe, and at the length haue deceiued their louers and déereſt friends.
            
            
               EVen as he that hath a ſonne, which is in good and perfect78 health, and a ſeruant that is excéeding ſicke, dealeth more roughly and ſeuerely with his ſonne, than with his ſeruant, not bicauſe he loueth his ſeruant more, than his ſonne, but bicauſe he would (if it might be) reſtore his ſicke ſeruant to his former health, but his ſonne, whom he loueth moſt déerely, he reprooueth, checketh, taunteth and correcteth: Euen ſo our God, ſomtimes afflicteth his déere children whom he moſt tenderly loueth, and doth ſuffer them to be exerciſed with wants, with wéepings and wailings, with ſighes and ſorrowfull ſobs, with hunger and cold, with nakednes and want of harbour, with heauines of hart, and vexation of ſoule, with ſicknes of bodie and want of libertie, and with a thouſand other calamities and cares, and in the meane time ſuffereth the wicked and vngodlie ones of the world, to want nothing, he giueth them health, wealth, and libertie, worldly honor and dignitie, and what not? meaning and purpoſing by theſe meanes (if the fault be not in themſelues) to bring them to knowe, to feare, to honor and to ſerue him, by whoſe prouidence and appointment they haue and enioy all thoſe good bleſſings, and ſo be cured and healed of the ſores and ſicknes of their ſoules. The holy men and ſeruants of God, haue euer béene wel experienced in the Lords chaſtenings:

                  Ieremie the prophet ſaith to God: Thou haſt chaſtened me, OIerem. 13. Hebr. 12. Lord, and I am corrected. And the Apoſtle ſaith: Whom the Lord loueth, he chaſteneth, and he correcteth euery ſonne, that he receiueth. Againe: Let vs reioice in tribulations. And to theRom. 5. Galat. 6. Galathians: God forbid, that I ſhould reioice but in the croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whereby the world is crucified vnto me, and I to the world: by the croſſe, vnderſtand the afflictions of Chriſt, wherewith the Apoſtle was exerciſed for Chriſts ſake. For this muſt euer be true: All that will liue godly in Chriſt2. Tim. 3. Ieſu, ſhall ſuffer perſecution. So that, the troubles and afflictions of this life, are not reiections, maledictions, and the curſes of God, but rather, and moſt truly, infallible ſignes of his grace, and true tokens of his loue and mercies toward vs. Bleſſed are theyMatth. 5. (ſaith truth it ſelf) that ſuffer perſecution for righteouſnes ſake.
            
            
               AS the ſkilfull pearle ſeller, and cunning lapidarie doth79 willingly ſuffer the Indian diamond, or adamant, to be ſmitten and ſt

                  ooken with great and weightie blowes, bicauſe he knoweth well, that the hammer and anuill will ſooner be bruiſed, than the diamond or adamant will be broken: So our moſt wiſe God, yea onely wiſedome it ſelfe, ſuffereth men of excellent vertues, of vnquenchable loue &amp; charitie, and inuincible conſtancie, to fall into diuers temptations, and to be plunged déepe into manifold miſeries, bicauſe he will haue their inward graces to breake out, and ſo ſhine before men, that they ſeeing the conſtancie of his ſaints, may glorifie God which is in heauen. For he is ſure that they be conſtant, and that nothing can ſeparate them from the loue of God. Ioſeph was impriſoned in Egypt:Gen. 39. Ierem. 20. Ezech. I. Matth. 11. Ieremie in Iudea: Ezechiel in Chaldea: and Iohn Baptiſt by wicked Herod: and yet all theſe and infinite others, did neuer ſhrinke from God, but as they liued in him, ſo they died in him, and are exalted vp on high, and ſhall dwell in his tabernacle,Pſal. 15. and reſt in the hill of his holines for euer and euer. And ſo ſhall we do, if we will be as they were.
            
            
               AS when thou ſéeſt a great and goodly citie, conſiſting of many80 and ſundry ſorts of men, ſome of great reputation, and very many of ſmal eſtimation: ſome exceeding rich, and infinite others extremely poore: ſome in their freſh and floriſhing youth, and ſome crooked with old age, where all theſe, though among themſelues

ſelues they be diuers and ſundrie, do liue in great concord, and agrée well togither, and are kept all within the bounds and limits of good and godly diſcipline, thou wilt by and by iudge, that the prince or gouernor of the ſame is iuſt, and very mightie and wiſe, though thou ſeeſt him not: Euen ſo, in the huge greatnes of this world, and the agreement and well hanging togither, of the things contained in the ſame, though differing in their natures, and the apt and fit placing of the whole, it cannot be, but that thou wilt preſently conceiue in thy minde, that there is a great, a wiſe, and mightie creator, and preſeruer of theſe things. For not onely the mighty works of God in this great world, but alſo his incomparable workmanſhip in the little world, that is in man himſelfe (for ſo he is called of ſome) do teach vs woonderfull knowledge of God. The prophet Dauid ſpeaking to God, ſaith: Thy knowledge, O Lord, is made woonderfull by me. As if he ſhould ſay: By the knowledge of my ſelfe (O Lord) I am come to a woonderfull knowledge of thée.
            
            
               AS the cauſe of trées and plants, of their rootes, ſtocks, ſtems,81 and boughes, is in the ſéede: So, the cauſe of our tranſgreſſions, foule ſinnes, and moſt dangerous iniquities, is our owne corruption, wherewith we are mooued, and inclined to all euill: and the ignorance, and not knowing of our ſelues, wherewith we are greatly hindred, in the knowledge of our God, and do alſo moſt ſharply cenſure thoſe things in others, which we do loue, and cheriſh in our ſelues. We muſt know alſo, that ſelfe loue, is vnto vs a perilous theefe, for it doth rob vs, of the knowledge of our ſelues, it blindeth our eies, and darkeneth our vnderſtanding: It is a very common théefe, ſo ranging and robbing in euery place, ſo raigning and ruling without controlment, yea it is ſo welcome to high and lowe: that that ſaying of the apoſtle, may ſéeme to haue beene ſpoken of theſe our daies: Dangerous2. Tim. 3. times will come (ſaith he) and men ſhal be louers of themſelues. O how true is it? yea it is to too true, that we neuer ſet our ſelues before our owne eies, that is, we neuer ſtay▪ we neuer examine, our owne thoughts, words and works, but let them paſſe and go on, like roages and vagrant perſons, till by ſome others they be apprehended, they go vntouched of our ſelues: we be lynces, that is, earneſt priers into the liues of others, but about our owne liues, we are very moles or wants, that is, ſtarke blinde.
            
            
               
               EVen as whéeles do run moſt lightly: So godly men, and82 vertuous women, are moſt eaſily mooued, to euery good action, vpon any occaſion offered. If they do but heare of the wants, miſeries, calamities, pouertie, impriſonment and ſicknes of their poore brethren, they preſently begin to care for them, and to caſt with themſelues, how they may reléeue them, ſuccour, helpe, and comfort them. The troubles and afflictions of their Chriſtian brethren, are to them, as if they were their owne.
            
            
               AS a whéele doth touch the ground, onely with one ſide, or a83 little part, and with the other, is lifted from the earth: So, a man that feareth God, and loueth righteouſnes, and is carefull for the ſaluation of his ſoule, dwelleth héere vpon the earth onely in bodie, but in affect and deſire, he is lifted vp on high, and ſo dwelleth in heauen, in his meditations, and the thoughts of his hart.
            
            
               AS men in a cléere and bright ſhining night, paſſing or trauelling84 néere vnto a déepe riuer, do plainly ſée and behold in a calme, the ſhadowes and beautifull likeneſſes, of the round moone and gliſtering ſtars, but thoſe ſtars and moone, though they ſéeme to be in the waters, are notwithſtanding placed in the ſkies: Euen ſo, men that haue gathered, and learned wiſedome out of the word of God, and do direct the whole courſe of their liues, by the line of the ſame, although they ſéeme to be in the flood of this life, which daily is tending towards the ſea of death, yet in ſpirit and in minde, they are fixed and placed in heauen, and leading an heauenly and godly life, they contemne and deſpiſe all thoſe things, which vnto the wicked and vngodly, do ſéeme great, high and precious matters, and do draw after them with great force the moſt part of the world.
            
            
               AS it behooueth him that walketh vpon coardes ſtrained85 and faſtened on high, diligently to looke to his footing, that he may not totter, or decline this way, or that way, bicauſe he muſt néeds periſh, if neuer ſo little hée miſſe his way: Euen ſo, it ſtandeth vs vpon, to be warie, and carefully to looke about vs, and to take good héede where we ſet our feete, that is, our affections and the delights of our harts, leaſt we fall downe headlong into the bottomleſſe gulphe of Gods diſpleaſure.

For if we will fire our affections and bende our wils, with a deliberate conſent, to do the thing that is euill, vniuſt, and vngodly, making no conſcience of any thing that we do, be it neuer ſo oppoſite and contrary to the will of God, it cannot be but falling from the ſtate of grace, we ſhall fall moſt ſuddenly and ſhamefully, into the infernall pit of hell, death and damnation. From whence there neuer was, there is not, neither euer ſhall be, anyLuc. 16▪
                   returne nor deliuerie. Our blindnes in heauenly things héere, ſhal be moſt iuſtly rewarded, with intollerable tortures, in moſt horrible, feareful and ſtinking darknes there, where no eaſe, end nor remedie ſhall euer be found. Let vs therefore be very carefull, and take good héede, that we loſe not our eies: and indéede our eies are then put out, and we do vtterly loſe our ſight, when we giue our ſelues ouer to carnall delights, to fleſhly luſts, to worldly pleaſures, and to loue more the things that are below in the earth, then thoſe things that are aboue in heauen with God, &amp; euerlaſting life it ſelfe. This was ſhadowed in Samſon: for the Paleſtines pulled not out the eies of that famous man,Iudic. 16. vntill he had ſlept in Dalilaes boſome: neither ſhall thy enimies blinde thée, vnleſſe thou wilt reſigne thy ſelfe to foule delights &amp; filthy pleaſures. Wherſoeuer ſoule luſtes and forbidden pleaſures do beare the ſway, there is no place for temperance; and in the kingdom of diſhoneſt loue, vertue is not known. And where vertue is wanting, there is no wiſedome: and where wiſedome is baniſhed, there is no ſight, but a miſerable blindnes of minde: and where Sathan the God of this world hath blinded mens mindes, there is moſt certaine death and lamentable deſtruction. The deuill that old ſerpent, our deadly enimie, doth ſo extremely hate vs, that he layeth and kéepeth a continuall ſiege againſt all vertue, and doth what he can to poiſon and to kill it, euen in the hatching. We haue great néede therefore of manie eies, and many and continuall watchings, that we may auoyde and eſcape his deceits, that he trap vs not. Pharao would kill the male children of the Iſraelites in their birth, bicauſe the people of God ſhould not increaſe, this was the commandement of the deuill of Egypt: and now Sathan doth what he can, to kill and ſlaie all good works, and all godly purpoſes, yea, he laboureth by all his meanes and inſtruments, to ſtrangle and to ſmother the very firſt motions of them, in the harts and minds of men, leaſt they ſhould increaſe and multiply: he is that dragon with ſeauenApoc. 1

We may very fitly vnderſtand by the woman the ſoule of man, which, when it thinketh and purpoſeth to do good works, is ſaid to conceiue, and when it bringeth foorth and perfourmeth the ſame in deed, is ſaid to be deliuered, as a woman of a childe: but then ſathan is foorthwithEſay. 26. moſt eager and buſie to ſtop the kindlie birth of vertue and godlines, and to ſmother it ſo, that it neuer come to light. The Lord ſtrengthen vs againſt his force, and make vs wiſe againſt ſubtiltie, that in all his ſleights and craftie conueyances, he may bée diſappointed, and we deliuered from him, and that we may do the will, and walke in the waies of our God, mauger ſathan and all his meanes.

As the Oſtrige hath wings and flieth not, ſo they haue calling, but they anſwere it not: they haue knowledge, but they practiſe it not: they haue words, but they worke not.
            
            
               THe Kite being a moſt gréedie and rauening foule, mounteth87 exceeding high, ſo that you would thinke ſhee toucheth the gliding clouds, and as ſhee flieth doth ſpred her wings: and yet when ſhee is at the higheſt, ſhee hath hir eies faſt ſet and fixed below in the earth, pryeng and ſpieng to catch (if ſhée can) ſome poore chicken, or other praie within hir talons: indéed ſhée flieth high, but neuer looketh vp towards heauen, but altogither downe towards the earth: euen ſo, thou ſhalt ſée a number of men, faining a certaine ſanctymonie, and counterfeiting much holines, who, although they are thought with the contemplation of heauenly things, to be rauiſhed and taken vp into the clouds, yet they minde nothing leſſe then true godlines, neither any thing more then earth and earthly things. Their ſtudie is for worldly honor, their greateſt carking and care is, for rich and large reuenues, for dignities, princes fauours and worldlie wealth. Such men turne their backs to heauen and flie from

God, and ſo being diſappointed of that light which they ſéemed to ſéeke for, they are wrapped in palpable and moſt dangerous darknes: but they that truely ſéeke after God, do (by the helpe and aſſiſtance of his holie ſpirite) tranſlate and conuey their minds from earth to heauen, and ſo are illuminated with the brightnes of God his grace and loue: for ſo ſaith Chriſt himſelfe, He that foloweth me, walketh not in darknes, but ſhall haue theIohn. 8. light of life.

Such men are not in loue with this worlde, nor with the tranſitorie things of the ſame.

               LEarned and famous writers do report, that in the vniuerſall91 world, there is nothing harder then the adamant ſtone, eſpecially that which is had in the Indians, which in firmenes, hardnes, and valure excéedeth the reſt: but I am of opinion, that the hart of man is harder than it: for the adamant, though it will giue place to no other thing, nor be ſoftened by any other means, yet is it ſaid to be ſubdued and mollified, with the warme bloud of a goate: But the hart of a man, being hardned through the continuance and cuſtome of ſinne, wil not be mollified, brideled nor tamed, neither with the bloud of a goat, nor yet with the bloud of that immaculate lambe Chriſt Ieſus, which gaue himſelfe a ſacrifice for vs, vpon the altar of the croſſe, and there beſtowed his bloud, that he might mittigate and appeaſe our wilde mindes, and pricke to the quicke our harde and ſenſeleſſe harts, and to open vnto vs the waie to the attaining of eternal life, and euerlaſting ſaluation. O harde, (ſaith Bernard) and hardened ſonnes of Adam, that will not be mollified with ſo great a force and power of loue! With whom the bitter pangs, of Chriſt his death and paſſion, cannot preuaile. We are ſurely that people, to whom the Lord ſpeaketh by Eſay the prophet, ſayeng: IEſa. 48. know that thou art hard harted, and that thy necke is a ſynewe of iron, and that thy face is of braſſe. And Ieremie out of doubt, ſpeaketh no leſſe of vs, than of the Iewes: they haue made (ſaithIerem. 5. he) their faces harder then flint, and they will not be conuerted. I would to God, theſe ſayings did onely touch the Iewes, and did not alſo hit a number of vs, that profeſſe the name of Chriſt, &amp; looke to be ſaued by him, pat vpon the thumbes. Wée are proud, hawtie and high minded, and we hate to be humbled: we are couetous, enuious &amp; leacherous, and we will not be brideled. Wée are very rich and religious in words, but we are very beggerly, and haue no religion in our works. Our lips and tongues onely are gilded, and tipt with good ſpéeches, but our harts are far from the Lorde. The almightie vouchſafe to open the eies of our mindes, and to mollifie our harts, that we may ſée and receiue his grace offered vnto vs, and that forſakeing our ſelues and our ſinnes, we may be conuerted vnto him.

               AS the nut and oliue trées, although they be beaten with93 rods, yet bring foorth moſt plentifull fruits: So we muſt not be weary of well dooing, nor caſte the exerciſe and practiſe of godlines behinde vs, but rather more willingly and feruentlie procéede &amp; go on in the ſame, although the friends of this world, ſhall braule and rate at vs, ſhall curſe, reuile, and moſt vnkindly intreate vs. The lot of vertue is, to be enuied, and to finde fewe friends, and (if at all) to be but coldly intertained with the moſt parte, and greateſt number of the worlde. The prophet of GodPſal. 119. complaineth, that for his vertues ſake, the princes of the earth, laid their heads togither againſt him, and yet he ſhronke not.
            
            
               EVen as a quiet, calme and pleaſant water, will ſhew vnto94 vs, if we looke into it, the verie image and likenes of our ſelues, as it were a glaſſe, but mooued, ſtirred and troubled, it doth not ſo: euen ſo our owne harts, if they be quiet, and not troubled with horrors, nor diſtempered with feares, will plainly ſhew vs what we be, ſo that we may eaſilie know our ſelues, and not be deceiued: but being filled with feares, toſſed with terrors, and ouerwhelmed with troubles, they cannot do ſo. It behooueth vs therefore, that our harts be not troubled, nor ouerladen with feares. Chriſt willeth his diſciples, that they fearsIoh. 14. not, nor that their harts be troubled: and in another place, hée ſaith: Feare not my little flocke. The prophet was in heauie plight, when he cried: O Lord my hart is ſore troubled: And inPſal. 55. and Pſal. 57. an other place: I was troubled in my ſléepe. Therefore, that we may haue our harts quiet, our ſoules in peace, and our conſciences vntroubled: Let vs beware of ſinne, flie from all iniquitie, and walke vprightly before our God, all the daies of our liues. God grant we may. Then may wée ſaie: The Lorde is the protectorPſal. 27. &amp; 23. of my life, of whom ſhall I be afraid. And againe: I will

feare no ill, for thou Lord art with me. And: if God be with vs,Rom. 8. who can hurt vs?

Of theſe Dauid ſpeaketh: They came about me like bees, &amp;c. Wicked men therefore muſt be taken héede of.Math. 10. Ioh. 10. Luc. 13. Math. 3. Luk. 3. For the Scriptures do painte them out in their colours, that we may ſhun them. Mathew and Iohn do call them woolues: Luke foxes: Mathew and Luke, the generation of vipers.

SuchMath. 5. men indeede hath Chriſt appointed to be the light of the world, and the ſalt of the earth. They ought to be full of loue to God and man. They ſhould liue as ſtrangers vpon the earth. They ſhould haue no acquaintance with pride, couetouſnes, ambition, emulation, and ſuch other ſinnes of the world.
            
            
               EVen as the ſailers gnomon, or rule, which is commonly called98 the marriners néedle, doth alwaies looke towards the north pole, and will euer turne towards the ſame, howſoeuer thou ſhalt place it: which is maruellous in that inſtrument, and néedle, whereby the marriners do know the courſe of the winds:

Euenſo, euery Chriſtian man, ought to direct the eies of his minde, and the waies of his hart to Chriſt. He is our north pole, and that fixed and conſtant north ſtar, whereby we ought all to be gouerned: he is our hope, and our truſt, he is all our ſtrength, whereupon we muſt ſtill relie. And as the gnomon, doth euer behold the north ſtar, whether it be cloſed and ſhut vp, in a cofer of golde, ſiluer or wood, neuer loſing his nature: ſo a right Chriſtian man, whether he abound in wealth, or be pinched with pouertie, whether he be of high, or lowe degrée in this world, ought continually to haue his faith and hope, ſurely built and grounded vpon Chriſt, and to haue his hart and minde faſt fixed and ſetled in him, and to follow him through thick and thin, through fire and water, through wars and peace, through hunger &amp; cold, through friends and foes, through a thouſand perils and dangers, through the ſurges and waues of enuie, malice, hatred, euill ſpéeches, railing ſentences, contempt of the world, fleſh and diuell, and euen in death it ſelfe, be it neuer ſo bitter, cruell and tyrannical, neuer to loſe the ſight and view of Chriſt, neuer to giue ouer our faith, hope and truſt in him. Let vs followe the counſell of the holy Ghoſt, which ſaith: Put me as a ſigne vpon thy hart: as if heCant. 8. ſhould ſay: Set me in thy hart, in ſtéede of a marke, whereat all thy thoughts, words and works, may be leuelled. Put out of thy hart, the marke of the world, and place me there as the end, vnto the which all thy purpoſes may tend: vpon whom all thy cares may be caſt, and in whom thou maiſt reſt thy ſoule in all peace. A woonderfull gnomon, and moſt excellent ſailing néedle, was that noble king, and famous prophet of God, Dauid, when he ſaid: I ſet the Lord alwaies before mine eies, for he is at myPſal. 16. right hand, that I ſhall not be mooued: Therefore (ſaith he) my hart reioiced, my toong was glad, and my fleſh ſhall reſt in hope. And the Apoſtle ſaith: Let vs run toward the fight that is ſetHeb. 12. before vs, looking ſtill vpon Ieſus, the author and finiſher of our faith: who hauing ioy ſet before him, indured the croſſe. God giue vs grace, continually to lift vp, our harts and mindes, our hand and eies to Chriſt Ieſus, and as Auguſtine ſaith, To behold ſtedfaſtly our head.
            
            
               AS all riuers of waters go into the ſea, bicauſe they came99 out of it, and as Salomon ſaith, All riuers and flouds returneEccleſiaſtes. 1 to the place whence they came: So, let vs go and

towards our God, with all our harts, ſtrength and powers, bicauſe we came out from him, and were created of him. Let vs therefore looke vpon him with the eies of a ſtedfaſt and conſtant faith, grounded vpon his word: let vs behold his glorie, and the bleſſednes of his ſaints, and let vs conceiue in our harts and ſoules, an vnfained loue to him: and let vs not haue two loues, one for our ſelues, and another for our neighbors, but let vs loue them and our ſelues both with one and the ſame loue, which may kindle and inflame our harts and mindes throughout, with an earneſt deſire of immortalitie, and that heauenly Ieruſalem. That we may ſay with the prophet: O my ſoule returne vntoPſal. 116. thy reſt, for the Lord hath done well to thée: or as it may be tranſlated, bicauſe the Lord hath reſtored thée to thy ſelfe: As if he ſhould ſay: O my ſoule, when thou didſt ſerue thy bodie, and waſt in bondage to it, it was no maruell, that thou didſt ſéeke the pleaſures thereof: but now ſéeing thou art thine owne, bicauſe the Lord hath reſtored thée to thy ſelfe, ſéeke not anothers pleaſure but thine owne: ſéeke thine owne reſt, and not the reſt of thy bodie, of the fleſh &amp; of the world: ſéeke God, delight in him, flie vnto him, and reſt thy ſelfe in him: put all thy cares, griefs, &amp; ſorrowes, in his loue and ſwéete comfort: thinke of eternall bleſſednes, preſſe it and print it ſurely in thy ſelfe. This is thy ſpirituall reſt, this is thine own and only delight, reſtored vnto thée, by the benefit and bountifulnes of God.
            
            
               THere is nothing liker vnto the world than the ſea. For as100 it floweth and ebbeth, and all the waues thereof, at the length fall into the earth: So this world is neuer quiet: it extolleth ſome, and caſteth downe others: but all the vanities of it, are ended in the graue. If the ſea lie open to many dangers: how perilous then is the world? if the ſea be troubled with ſtrange ſtormes: with what tempeſts then is the world toſſed? If they that ſerue by ſea, are neuer without great perils, how much more then, the ſeruants of the world? They, whoſe heads are vnder the girdle of the world, are continually ſhot at, with the darts of enuie, hatred and malice, and are euer couered as it were with cloudes and ſtormes of a thouſand cares. How many are ſlaues to pride? how many are dirtie drudges to couetouſnes? how many are conſumed in ſubſtance, ſoules, and bodies, by foule and filthie lecherie? How many are deuoured and ſwallowed

vp quicke, of ſorrowes and gréefes, of hart and minde? And doth not too much ioy, and reioicing in worldly trifles, kill ſome? Many die laughing, but mo ſorrowing, ſome with eating and drinking too much, and many through want of ſufficient, giue the world adew. Some grudge and whine, bicauſe they haue many children, and ſome are malcontent bicauſe they haue none: ſome grudge, not bicauſe they haue many, but bicauſe they haue bad ones: ſome boaſt of their beauties, and ſome mourne for their blacknes. Many deſire to liue long, but few to liue well. All would be rulers, and few will be ruled. What then ſhall we thinke of this world? Truly I thinke of it, as of a thing moſt dangerous, and moſt vaine: and the going out of it, is to me, as the ſhore is to a man, that hath trauelled far and long by ſea, and hath béene dangerouſly toſſed with the ſurges and waues of the ſame, ſomtimes throwen vp as it were into the clouds, and ſomtimes hurled downe, as it were into hell. And howſoeuer it beareth thée in hand, it will ſerue thée a ſluttiſh tricke in the end. It will promiſe thée health, but ere long thou muſt be ſicke: it will promiſe thée friends, but if aduerſitie ouertake thée, thy friends will be to ſéeke: it will promiſe thée wealth, and ſhortly after, thou ſhalt be in huckſters handling, and be faine to crouch to a beaſtly vſurer▪ that will eate vp thée, and all thou haſt: it will ſmile on thée, and deceiue thée, whatſoeuer it ſhall promiſe thée, Looke thou, for quid pro quo. Therfore if thou beeſt well aduiſed, ſay to it, and diſſemble not, farewell world. I deſire to be diſſolued and to be with the Lord Ieſus.
            
            
               AS the image of Nabuchadnezzar, although it had an head101 of fine gold, yet it fell, and was broken all to péeces, bicauſe it had féete of clay, which being touched with a ſtone, ouerthrew the whole inuention: So, iuſtice many times falleth to the ground, bicauſe, although the princes which are rightly called the heads of their countries, be very excellent iuſticers, and made as it were of the pureſt and fineſt gold of vertue, yet the miniſters of iuſtice are earthen, and do bend their harts and mindes, to nothing but earth and clay, and with gifts and rewards they are carried euery way: for gaine they will ſell iudgement, and breake the necke of iuſtice. If you ſhall touch their hands, with ſome precious ſtone, ſome iewell of gold, ſome coſtly plate, ſome gold or ſiluer curiouſly engrauen, or with ſome good round ſum

of gold or mony, though it be in an olde purſe, they will for thy ſake, turne vpſide downe, all the lawes of God, and man. And yet notwithſtanding, there be many ſuch ones in the world, it is not to be doubted, that there be ſome, yea many very good, vpright, and godly iuſticers with vs, which hate bribes, loue iuſtice with ſingle harts, and framing their whole liues after the rule of reaſon and equitie, do neuer willingly violate the lawe. God amend the worſe, and increaſe the better.
            
            
               EVen as a brooke in winter, is caried with great violence, and102 runneth with a mighty force, flowing ouer with abundance of waters on euery ſide, when there is no want nor néede of water, but in the heate of ſommer is dried vp and emptie, when water is ſcant and hard to be had, whereto thirſtie paſſengers as they trauell, running in hope of water to drinke, are vtterly deceiued: So, a fained and hollow harted friend, in the time of thy proſperitie, and rich eſtate, will promiſe thée many things, when thou haſt néede of nothing: but if the wind ſhall turne, and blow the contrarie way, and thou ſhalt be turned and toſſed with many ſharp brunts, and bluſtering blaſts, of troubles, aduerſitie, penurie and pouertie, thy friends (as thou thought) will be like a trée withered through want of ſap, and like a ditch without water, dried and parched with the heate of the ſunne. If thou be troubled in the citie, he will be gone into the countrie: if in the countrie, then his buſines is in the citie. He will hide himſelfe, he will ſtand a far off, he will be afeard to méete thée, yea he will liue in a continuall feare and dread, leaſt God ſhould vſe him, and make him his inſtrument to do thée good. Iob had great experience of this, when he complained, ſaying: My friends paſſedIob. 6. by me, or haue deceiued me, euen as a brooke that runneth ſwiftly in the vallies. Such men are friends of thy table, of thy welth, of thy fauour, and of thy friendſhip: they will waite of thy honor, thy lordſhip, thy worſhip and authoritie: but in pouertie, impriſonment, or in any other diſtreſſe or diſgrace, they will vtterly forſake thée. If thou wilt follow my counſell therefore, trie them throughly, and knowe them perfectly, and forſake thou them, before they forſake thée.
            
            
               AS a ſhadow doth follow that man, which is lighted with the103 bright beames of the ſunne, but if the ſunne be hid, or couered

with a cloud, the ſhadow vaniſheth▪ and is cleane gone: So, a painted and counterfetted friend, doth follow and ply that man, whom he perceiueth to be rich, to be famous, honorable, and in the princes fauour, at whoſe hands he hopeth that ſomething will be gotten: but if he ſhall fall into calamitie, be diſpoiled of his riches, and ſhall tumble downe from the top of his honor, into the lowe vallie of diſgrace, he preſently forſaketh him, and maketh no reckoning nor account of him. But a true friend is no changling. Salomon ſaith: He that is a friend, doth loueProuerb. 17. thée at all times, and a brother is tried in perplexitie and anguiſh. And Eccleſiaſticus ſaith: A friend ſhall not be knowen inEccleſ. 12. proſperitie, neither will an enimie be hid in aduerſitie. Auguſtine ſaith in one of his bookes of queſtions: There is nothing ſoAugust. lib. 83. quaestionum. Iſidor. lib. 3. de ſummo bono. much trieth a friend, as the bearing of his friends burden. And Iſidorus ſaith: Friendſhip in proſperitie is moſt doubtfull, neither is it eaſily diſcerned, whether a mans perſon, or his proſperous eſtate be loued. And an experienced man affirmeth, that,Boetius lib. 3. de conſolatione. whom proſperitie maketh a friend, him aduerſitie maketh a foe. Time doth ſhew and trie, who it is that loueth thée truly: in theſe our daies, friends for the moſt part, are rightly compared vnto the bird called a ſwallow, whoſe companie thou ſhalt haue in ſommer, but not in winter: ſo friends (as they go now adaies) will ſwarme about thée, ſo long as thou art able and willing, to féede their humors, and ſerue their turnes, but that ended, they will leaue thée, in the middeſt of a thouſand ſurges and waues, of what troubles ſoeuer ſhall light vpon thée.
            
            
               AS an huge and mightie fire, will be aſſwaged, and at the104 length, quite put out, if thou wilt withdraw the ſticks and other matter, that doth cheriſh and increaſe it: So, thy afflictions and troubles will come to an end, if thou wilt ceaſe to do euill, and giue ouer ſinne, before it giue ouer thée. Our ſinnes are thoſe drie ſticks, and ſtubble, wherewith the fire, not onely of the wrath and malice of infidels, and heretikes, but alſo of the wrath and indignation of God, is kindled, increaſed, and moſt mightily ſtirred vp againſt vs. They are our greateſt enimies, the Lord grant, that euer beholding them, we may vnfainedly forſake and hate them.
            
            
               AS a godly and a wiſe ſurgeon, purpoſing to cut the corrupted105 wounds of a ſicke bodie, and to take away, or to ſeare

with an hot iron, the rotten fleſh, in cutting or ſearing hath no pitie of the weake man, to the end, that in curing his ſore, and healing his wound, by cutting and ſearing, he may ſhew him great pitie: Euen ſo, our moſt wiſe God, that celeſtiall phyſition, and heauenly ſurgeon, ſmiteth vs, that he may heale vs, cuttethHeb. 12. and ſeareth vs, that he may cure vs. He ſmiteth whom he loueth, and doth chaſten him, that he may helpe and heale, the woundsDeut. 32. and ſores of his ſoule. The Lord himſelfe doth ſay: I kill, and I make aliue, I wound, and I make whole. And in the mouth of Amos the prophet, God hath theſe words to the Iſraelites: YouAmos 3. onely haue I knowen of all the families of the earth, therefore will I viſite all your iniquities: that is, I will be reuenged, and will puniſh all your ſinnes. For in the ſcripture, ſomtime, to viſite, is to puniſh. As in the Pſalm 89. If they breake my ſtatutes,Pſal. 89. 31. and kéepe not my commandements, then wil I viſite their tranſgreſſions with the rod, and their iniquitie with ſtrokes: yet my louing kindnes will I not take from him, neither will I falſifie my truth, &amp;c. As if the Lord ſhould ſay: If he offend, I will puniſh him, and haue mercie vpon him. The Lords iuſtice will haue puniſhment, and his promiſe will haue mercie. This is to our euerlaſting comfort, that the Lords chaſtenings, are to his children, his mercie.
            
            
               EVen as, in a ſea mooued and toſſed with great waues, and106 mightie ſurges, the pilots ſkill and wiſedome is throughly tried, and his manlines and courage perfectly ſéene: Euen ſo, a man that is godly without diſſembling, and religious without hypocriſie, in the middeſt of terrible tempeſts, of great troubles, when he is throwen vp, and hurled downe, toſſed héere, and cruſſhed there, in a thouſand ſtormes of dangers, then declareth his patience, his ſpirituall courage, and his vnmooueable conſtancie, in vertue and true holines. The princely prophet Dauid, being woonderfully afflicted, did beare moſt patiently, and tooke very quietly, the ſhameleſſe reproches of Shemei, leauing vnto vs an2. Sam. 16. euerlaſting monument, of an vnfained, and voluntarie patience. Yet when Dauid had gotten the victorie of his enimies, through the Lords mightie and ſtretched out hand, he tooke a great and dangerous fall, in cauſing the people to be numbred: wherein he offended God moſt highly, and brought a fearfull plague vpon2. Sam. 24. them, &amp; yet repenting he found mercy and forgiuenes of his gréeuous

and intolerable ſinnes. Héere may we ſee the benefit and commoditie, that commeth by the meanes of troubles and calamities, and that the Lord hath mercy vpon vs, euen then, when he ſéemeth to ſhew no mercie, but onely to deale in iudgement.
            
            
               AS, when one part of a man that is ſicke, is not capable of the107 remedie, wherewith he may be holpen, we are woont to applie the ſame remedie to another part: as if one be greeued, with extreme ache of the head, we are woont to ſtrike a veine of the arme, bicauſe the head will not abide phlebotomie, or blood letting: So, that we may helpe and heale many diſeaſes of the ſoule, we muſt kéepe the bodie in ſubiection to the ſpirit, and tame the luſts of the fleſh, and labour to bridle our affections, and to keepe them within the compaſſe of reaſon, ſobrietie and temperance.
            
            
               AS a water pot, or a violl, full of liquor, if ſuddenly it be108 ouerthrowen, doth ſhed and ſcatter the liquor: So a deuout and godlie hart, abounding with teares, being mooued and troubled with ſorrow, bicauſe of the iniuries, diſhonor, wrongs, and blaſphemies committed againſt the Lord, doth preſently powre out great abundance, and as it were mightie ſtreames of ſalt and bitter teares. The ſinnes of the Iewes committed againſt God, did draw out of the hart of Chriſt, great ſtore of teares, and ſent them trickling downe his cheekes: and theMatth 21. Luc. 19. prophet Dauid his eies guſhed out, and did run ouer with water, to ſée the wickednes of the vngodly. And Peters denying of Chriſt, when he came to himſelfe, made him wéepe bitterly. We are to too eager and forward, to reuenge euery little wrong done to our ſelues, but iniuries done againſt the Lord, do neuer once mooue vs: but we ought to be gréeued with his wrongs, and beare patiently our owne.
            
            
               EVen as wilde beaſts, being about to inuade and to ſet vpon109 their praie, will ſtoupe lowe, and bende themſelues, that they may fall, and ruſh vpon it, with the greater force, and more violence: euen ſo proude and miſchieuous men, being ſlie and ſubtle, ſometimes will crouch, and beare themſelues verie lowlie, that vnder the colour of diſſembled vertue, they may ſupplant, and deceiue the ſimple, and godly honeſt man, aduaunce

themſelues, and worke miſchiefe to others. The holie Ghoſt, by the prophet doth ſignifie ſo much, when he (ſpeaking of the proud man) ſaith: He will crouch and bowe, that he may get the vpperPſal. 10. hand of the poore. Theſe are dangerous men, their ſteps are not to be followed. True and ſingle harted chriſtians, muſt and wil, imbrace true and vnfained humility, and lowlines of hart. They imitate him that ſaith, Learne of me, for I am humble and lowlyMath. 11. in hart. They are euer ready, moſt eaſilie to pardon and forgiue, detractions and ſlanders, giuen out againſt their liues, iniuries and wrongs offered, and don to their innocency, obloquies and falſe reports, diuiſed and caſte abroad, to blemiſh their good names, and to ſtaine their credits. And on the other ſide, they bée euer bold and earneſt, in reproouing of ſinne, as ſpéeches that bée vaine and idle, rather offending then profiting the hearers, blaſphemie, and whatſoeuer may prouoke the almightie to diſpleaſure and anger. Theſe iniuries committed againſt the Lorde, do gréeue their harts a thouſand times more, then any violent or tyrannicall torture, that can be offered vnto their bodies and liues. They make them waile, wéepe, ſigh and ſob. I ſpeake of good Chriſtians, the number of them is ſmall, the Lorde increaſe it, and make it greater.
               Amen.
            
            
               AS the wings of eagles, with their ſtripe or blowe, do marthe110 wings, and breake the feathers of other birds: So, the mightie and great men of the Iewes, with their tyrannicall crueltie, and moſt helliſh impietie, were wont to draw to deſtruction, and to drag to death, the weaker ſort, and ſuch as were innocent, and tendered the glory and praiſe of God. As the ſcripture in many places doth declare. Manaſſes, as it is written, ſhed2. Reg. 21. innocent bloud excéeding much, till he repleniſhed Ieruſalem from corner to corner. And Chriſt himſelf beholding Ieruſalem, with a pitifull voice, ſaide: O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, thou that killeſt the prophets, and ſtoneſt to death, thoſe that are ſent vnto thee, &amp;c. And Stephen the martyr of Chriſt, as Luke makethMath. 23. mention in the Acts, ſaith to the Iewes: Which of the prophetsAct. 17. haue not your forefathers perſecuted? and haue killed them, that foretold of the comming of that iuſt. And in the Epiſtle to theHeb. 11. Hebrewes, the apoſtle ſaith: they were ſtoned, they were hewen a ſunder, they were tempted, they were ſlaine with the ſworde, they wandred vp and downe, in ſhéepe ſkins▪ and goate ſkins,

being deſtitute, afflicted and tormented. Thus was it then: I would to God, there were not the like nowe, euen among ſome, that profeſſe the name of Chriſt, and his Goſpel now, as though they would die in his quarrell, and ſpend all in the defence of his truth. The Lorde roote out all hypocriſie, and conuert or ſubuert all hypocrites.
            
            
               AS great flouds and ſwelling riuers, when they ouerflowe111 their chanels, and do breake through their bankes, by reaſon of their raging and violent ſtreames, and ſo ſpread and run abroad, can not fill and couer the fieldes with water, but they hurt corne or graſſe, or what ſo elſe, is in their waie: So, great riches, mightie powers, and high dignities, when they growe and increaſe in wicked, and vngodly men, do not ſpread abroade, and run ouer the fieldes, and limites of common wealthes, but they do much harme: to wit, they polle and pill away, the riches and ſubſtance, of the ſéely weake and poore men, they fill their diches, I meane their purſes, with the blood of innocents: they build their honors, and eſtabliſh their dignities, vpon the diſgrace, and the oppreſſion of the ſaints and ſeruants of God: And whatſoeuer is in their waie, and to their liking, they carrie it with them, by hooke or crooke, by right or wronge: they care not who wéepe, ſo they laugh: who be emptie, ſo they be full: who be vndone, ſo they be aduanced. Héere hence come ſlaughters, and murthers: Thus are many brought into great calamities, and miſeries. But they that do theſe things to others, do hurt themſelues moſt. For whiles they hurt others, in their bodies, goods, or names, they kill their owne ſoules.
            
            
               AS a man much mooued with anger, and far out of frame112 through indignation and wrath, intending to kill his brother, ſhould throw at him, precious ſtones, goodly pearles, and rich iewels, ſhould not damnifie, nor hurt his brother, bicauſe he woulde gather them vp, kéepe them, and inrich himſelfe with them: Euen ſo, tyrants diſpoſed to kill, and with fire and ſword to put to death, the ſaints and true ſeruants of God, which do excell in true piety, and vnfained loue to God and man, do torment them, with diuers ſorts, and ſundrie kinds of moſt cruell martyrdome, of which things the children of God are glad, and do reioice, and grow ſtronger, and richer in Chriſt, &amp; being throughly

armed with a godly patience, they do take, and beare them, moſt quietly for God his ſake, without murmuring or grudging, euen as their croſſe, wherewith moſt willingly, they follow their Lord and ſauiour Chriſt, and do account ſuch tortures ineſtimable riches, and themſelues happie, that they be thought woorthie to ſuffer ſuch things, for the truth ſake, and in the Lords quarell. Such euer haue béene all the martyrs of Chriſt, that when they haue béene haled and dragged, to moſt cruell torments, and tyrannicall executions, they haue taken and imbraced them, moſt cheerefully, as though they were rich and delicate banquets.
            
            
               AS precious iewels, made of moſt pure gold, wrought cunningly113 &amp; curiouſlie, with great workmanſhip, the néerer thou ſhalt come vnto them, and the more ſtedfaſtly and cléerely thou ſhalt behold them, the finer, the brauer, and more excellent thou wilt iudge them: Euen ſo, as thou ſhalt come néerer in vnderſtanding and knowledge, vnto the ſecrets and myſteries of God, conteined in his written word, and with the greater puritie of minde, the more ſtrength of faith, and the brighter light of the grace of God, thou ſhalt looke into them, the profounder, the déeper, the more diuine and heauenly, yea and the more comfortable to thy ſoule, will they ſéeme and appéere vnto thée, euery day. Inſomuch, that thou wilt iudge thy ſelfe, to haue béen little better then blinde, and to haue ſéene nothing as thou ought in the myſteries of the diuine word. And thou wilt make haſte to crie vnto the Lorde with the prophet: Open mine eies O Lord,Pſal. 119. and I ſhall ſée and conſider the woonderfull things of thy lawe. But that man, that truſting to his owne gifts, wit and learning, and hath his hart and minde bewitched with this worlde, and poyſoned with ſinne, taking pleaſure in thoſe things which the Lord hath forbidden, will go about to pearce into the moſt holie worde, and to ſearch out the ſecrets, of the great and moſt highe God, he ſhall loſe his labour, open his vanitie, miſſe the marke he ſhot at, and die in the blindnes wherein he liued, and ſo paſſe hence to his owne deſtruction, the iuſt reward of his preſumption, be he neuer ſo wittie, ſkilfull and learned. Through thy commandementsPſal. 119. (ſaith the Lords prophet) I am wiſer then all my enimies, learneder then my teachers, and better experienced then the ancient men of the worlde. Therefore true wiſedome, the beſt learning, and heauenly experience, is gotten and had out

of the lawe of God, by the inward working, of the holie Ghoſt, in our harts and minds. The Almightie vouchſafe to write his lawes and ſtatutes in all our harts, that therby we may be wiſe, againſt fleſh, this inchaunting world, ſin and ſathan.
            
            
               AS the hauke is then loſt, when truſting to hir wings, ſhée114 riſeth and mounteth too high: So then, do vaine men fall far from God, when with their owne wit, reaſon, and wiſedome onely, and alone, they will vnderſtande the déepe miſteries of God, as though the counſels and wiſedome, of Gods eternal maieſtie, might and could be comprehended, with the reaſon &amp; wit of man. The Apoſtle his counſell is holie and good: be not tooRom. 11. high minded, but feare.
            
            
               AS they that haue cléere and ſound eies, do eaſilie indure the115 bright light of the ſunne, wherewith eies that be ſore and diſeaſed, are greatly offended: So, vertuous and godly men, are illuminated, and woonderfully cléered in their vnderſtanding, and the eies of their minds, with the diuine and heauenly light of the word of him, that ſaith: I am the light of the world: wherwithIoh. 8. the wicked and vngodly, are highly offended, in ſo much that they hate the light, and loue darknes more then it. And ſo growing blinder and blinder euery day, at the length they fall, and tumble downe headlong into the inſaciable pit, of eternall deſtruction.
            
            
               AS a pot full of ſwéete liquor, if it be made hote, and boyled116 vpon the fire, will driue away flies, that they will not come néere it, but if it be cold, the flies will by and by go into it, and it will receiue them, and they will corrupt and conſume it: Euen ſo the hart of man, if it be inflamed, with a true and ſincere loue of God, will not receiue into it, thoſe dangerous temptations, which are continually flying about it, but wil remooue, and driue them far off, and giue no place vnto them: but if by reaſon of ſlothfull idlenes in heauenly things, and for want of a godly courage, it grow cold in the loue of the Lord, then is it obuious, and wide open, to all temptations, it barreth out none, it receiueth all, none are reiected, be they neuer ſo wicked: all are imbraced, intertained and welcome. Then is it a receptacle of all abominations: as idolatrie, blaſphemie, murther, adulterie, and whatſoeuer

is wicked, miſcheeuous and damnable. The Lord therefore vouchſafe, to take from vs, all idle ſlothfulnes in the matters of God, and our ſaluation, and to fill our harts full of vnfained loue, to himſelfe aboue all things, and to our neighbors as to our ſelues, and for his owne ſake, euen to our enimies, that ſathan our ſworne enimie, that ſoule flie of hell, may neuer finde ſo much as one chinke or chap, where through he may créepe into our harts.
               Amen. Amen.
            
            
               AS in a true, perfect, and certaine clocke, the whéeles being117 tempered, and in equall and due proportion diuided, do performe their courſes, and do keepe their ſeuerall compaſſes, without iarring, or differing one from another, euenly and alike: ſo that, one moouing, the others are mooued, and one ſtanding, the reſt are ſtill, and ſtir not, ſo that, though they be many in number, in frame, faſhion, and agréement, they are but one: Euen ſo in a Chriſtian commonwealth, there ought to be one, and the ſelfeſame will, and ſo great a concord, and likenes of mindes, reconciled and drawen togither, by vertue it ſelfe, and ſo inſeparably linked one to another, with the infringible band of ſincere loue in Chriſt, that though in bodies, they be infinite and innumerable, yet in vnanimitie, conſent, and good agréement, in the Lord Ieſu, they ſhould be all as one man. This is that vnitie, and brotherly loue, which God himſelfe, ſo highly commendeth in the mouth of his prophet ſaying: Behold how good and how ioyfullPſal. 133. a thing it is, brethren to dwell euen togither, &amp;c. To this end came our ſauiour Chriſt (that I may vſe the words of Zacharie) euen to guide and direct our feete into the way of peace. And the holy Apoſtle doth admoniſh vs, to kéepe the vnitie of the ſpirit, inLuc. 
                        •
                     . Epheſ. 4. the band of peace. And to the Romanes he ſaith▪ The kingdome of God, is not meate and drinke, but righteouſnes and peace. Againe, is not that example of our ſweete ſauiour, woorthie of all men to be imbraced and imitated? Simon (ſaith Chriſt to Peter) of whom do the kings of the earth, take tribute or poll mony? of their children or of ſtrangers? Peter anſwered, Of ſtrangers. then ſaid Ieſus, Then are the children frée. Neuertheles (ſaith Chriſt) leaſt we ſhould offend them, go thy way to the ſea, &amp;c. and pay for thée and me. Lo
                     •
                  , to auoid offence, and to preſerue peace, what our ſauiour Chriſt himſelfe was contented to do, euen that he néeded not, and was frée from. Much to blame therefore, are

all they, and far from following the ſteps of Chriſt, which ſéeke not by all meanes lawfull and poſſible, to maintaine the vnitie and peace of the church of Chriſt. The enimies of this peace are very intolerable men. The Lord by his prophet calleth themEſay 48. wicked and vngodly men: There is no peace to the vngodly. And Salomon doth number them, among the enimies of God, whichProuerb. 6. do ſowe diſcord and diſſention, among brethren.
            
            
               EVen as the ſpirit of man, doth not ſtrengthen the members118 of the body, vnleſſe they be faſt and ſurely ioined togither: So, the holy Ghoſt, doth not reuiue and comfort, the members of the Church, when they fall away, and will not continue in league and fellowſhip with the ſeruants of God. Longer than they are faſt bound, and knit to the congregation, of Gods people, in loue and peace in Chriſt, the holy Ghoſt doth miniſter no ſtrength, no conſolation, no comfort vnto them. There remaineth, nothing elſe in ſuch men, but a numneſſe, and an extreme blindnes, in heauenly things. And whiles in their arrogancie and pride, they forſake and condemne the church of God, bicauſe they cannot draw it into ſubiection, to their fond and fantaſticall humors, they become of men, diuels incarnate.
            
            
               AS the pilote of a ſhip, without the ſhine of ſunne or moone,119 cannot take the hauen of any land: So a man, without the light of grace, can neuer attaine to the hauen of glorie, but howſoeuer he perſuadeth himſelfe, that he caſteth his anchor in a place of ſafetie, it falleth out in the end, that he caſteth it vpon a rocke, where there is no hope of ſaluation.
            
            
               AN eagle, ſo long as hir yoong ones, be not very flidge and120 throughly feathered, ſhe doth not ſuffer them to go out of the neſt, and to flie abroad: but after they be perfectly winged, &amp; in the beautie &amp; ſtrength of their feathers, ſhe throwes them out of the neſt, that they may flie, and exerciſe their wings and feathers, and vſe them to the end wherfore they haue them: Euen ſo our ſauiour Chriſt, that heauenly eagle, after his reſurrectiō, commanded his diſciples to ſtay at Ieruſalem, as it wereAct. 1. &amp; 2. in a neſt, and not to depart thence, vntill in the day of Pentecoſt, he had filled them with the grace of the holy Ghoſt: &amp; then he commanded them, that paſſing through the world, and traueling

through diuers coaſts of the earth, they ſhould publiſh abroad, and ſpread far and neare, the Goſpell of his kingdome. This example of Chriſt, is followed at this day, to the great comfort and benefit of Chriſt his church, when godly Archminiſters, lay not their hands vpon any, to admit them, to be laborers in the Lords vineyard, nor to do the office of a miniſter, vntill they finde them ſufficiently learned, and well furniſhed with gifts and graces from God, ſo far as they be able to diſcerne and iudge.
            
            
               EVen as the eagle, hauing hir yoong ones ſhut vp in the neſt,121 although ſhe flieth excéeding high, &amp; pearſeth the loftie aire, yet ſhe withdraweth not hir eies from hir yoong ones, but ſtill beholdeth them: and they alſo, crying after their maner, with their ſtretched out necks, do looke after hir: Euen ſo the Lord Ieſus aſcending into heauen, did behold his diſciples, and they alſo hungring and thirſting after him, did faſten their eies vpon him, and did not loſe the ſight of him, vntill he pearſed and broke open the heauens, and entred into the preſence of his father. And although they were diuided from him in body, yet in hart and minde they followed him ſtill. And Ieſus that heauenly eagle, ſéeing from heauen, a fierce and cruell hauke, preparing to deſtroy his neſt, and to kill his yoong ones, he on the other ſide prepared himſelfe, and came againſt the hawke, ouerthrew him, and laid him proſtrate vpon the ground. The hawke was Saule,Acts. 9. who (that I may ſpeake, as the ſcripture ſpeaketh) breathing out threatnings and ſlaughter, againſt the diſciples and ſeruants of the Lord, he went vnto the high prieſt, and deſired letters of him to Damaſcus, againſt all the Chriſtians that he ſhould finde there, &amp;c. but the Lord Ieſus did hurle him againſt the ground, and gaue him for meate vnto his church, and to the yoong ones of his neſt, whom he ſought to deſtroy, who now being called Paul, doth recreate and refreſh the whole church of God, with holy &amp; moſt heauenly doctrine. Behold how the lord hath euer prouided well, for his neſt, that is, his church, his ſaints and ſeruants. And this is our comfort in all extremities, euen to the end of the world: For as of old, &amp; from age to age, he hath prouided for his owne, and hath defended, preſerued, and deliuered them, in all their diſtreſſes, were they neuer ſo deſperate, in the opinions of men, ſo will he do ſtill, and for euer, if we be not the cauſe of the contrarie, through our wilfull, obſtinate, and manifold ſinnes,

and moſt impudent impenitencie. The Lord ſhew mercie vnto vs, and guide our harts, minds, and all our waies, to the right honoring of his maieſtie, and true praiſe of his name.
            
            
               AS we are woont to eate, peares and the kirnels of nuts,122 but throw from vs vpon the grounde, the parings and ſhels: So we ought vnfainedly to be in loue, and delighted with vertue and godlines, and to contemne and deſpiſe the ſhape, ſhew or ſhadow of the ſame, being ſeparated and diuided from vertue it ſelfe: for, to retaine and hold the faſhion and likenes of vertue, without the ſubſtance of the ſame, is meere hypocriſie.
            
            
               THat man that doth couer and hide, his foule faults, and123 lothſome ſins, with a faire and beautifull ſhew of vertues, fayning an holines where none is, is not to be counted religious, but an hypocrite: Like vnto a ſwan, whoſe feathers are all white, but hir fleſh blacke, white without and blacke within.
            
            
               THe margarits, thoſe little white ſhining precious ſtones,124 which do grow within ſhell fiſhes in the ſea, in this point are very marueilous and woonderfull, that though they be bred and increaſed in the ſea, yet haue they no ſimilitude nor likenes with the ſea: For the ſea is blue or ſkie coloured, but the margarits are white: The ſea is horrible, and full of diſcomfiture, but they are chéerefull, pleaſant, and ſo beautifull to behold, that they mooue much, greatly delight, and allure mightily mens eies to looke vpon them: the ſea is bitter, but they are amiable, and without all bitternes: But rather in ſome ſort and meaſure, by reaſon of their cleerenes and brightnes, they repreſent the ſkie, the reaſon is, bicauſe they receiue influence from thence. Such are vertuous and godly men, which are ſurely grounded, &amp; certainely ſetled, in the loue of God, and true Chriſtian religion, who being borne and brought vp in this world, haue no ſemblance, likenes nor faſhion of the ſame. In deſire they be drawn, in will they be ſeuered, in words they differ, and in works they vtterly diſagree from it. And they do rather reſemble in ſome meaſure heauen, from whence they receiue the influence of the grace and fauour of God.
            
            
               
               EVen as the precious ſtone called a iacincte, is turned and125 changed with the aire: (for in a cléere aire, it is bright, and in a cloudie ſeaſon, it is darkeſome, and not ſo pleaſant:) So, the preachers, and teachers of the worde of God, in their teaching and preaching, ought to frame themſelues, to méete with the maners, ages and qualities of all their hearers. So did the apoſtle among the Corinthians: Wée ſpeake wiſdome ſaith1. Cor. 2. he, among them that are perfect: And againe he ſaith: I could1. Cor. 3. not ſpeake vnto you, as vnto ſpirituall men, but as vnto babes in Chriſt Ieſu. I gaue you milke to drinke, and not meate, for yée were not yet able to beare it, neither yet now are, &amp;c. Againe:1. Cor. 9. I am made all things to all men, that at the leaſt I may win ſome to Chriſt.
            
            
               AS one and the ſame medicine, is not vſed and miniſtred to126 all that be diſeaſed and ſicke, but diuers medicines, according to their diuers diſeaſes: So one and the ſelfe ſame doctrine, is not agréeable to all hearers: The teaching therefore, and preaching of the miniſters of Chriſt, muſt be ſo ordered and deuided, that, hauing diuers and ſundrie hearers, whoſe caſes differ much, and are not all alike, euery one may haue his ſeuerall portion, that not one, through want of diſcretion in him, go emptie away.
            
            
               AS a diligent and learned phyſition, before he miniſter anie127 phiſicke to his ſicke patiente, ought not onely to ſéeke out, and to know the diſeaſe of him, whom he purpoſeth to cure, but alſo his maners, his vſuall behauiour, the nature of his bodie, and his qualities: So, a godly wiſe preacher of the worde, muſt do his beſt indeuour, to knowe the infirmities, maners, and diſpoſitions of his auditorie, that ſpirituall phiſicke, ſit and méete for euery one, may be miniſtred in due time.
            
            
               EVen as that precious ſtone called a carbuncle, doth not in128 darknes loſe his ſhine and excellent beautie: So, a vertuous and godlie man, in the extreame darknes of infinit calamities, obloquies, curſings, railings, backbitings, ſlaunders, and whatſoeuer, doth ſhewe his Chriſtian pacience, and quiet ſuffering: For he knoweth well, that ſuch things do profite much to aduance the praiſe of true and noble vertues.
            
            
               
               THe hart of man, is like vnto a cenſer, filled ful of hot coles,129 and made readie to receiue, whatſoeuer thou wilt caſt into it: For euen as, if thou ſhalt caſt into a cenſer, odoriferous and ſwéete pomander bals, the whole houſe will bée filled, with a moſt ſwéete ſauour, and pleaſant perfume: but if thou ſhalt caſt into it, brimſtone or ſome ſuch matter, all the houſe wil be full of moſt horrible ſtinche: So, in like maner, if thou ſhalt put into the hart of ſome man, good and wholeſome counſels, and ſhalt inſtruct him with godly aduertiſements, and ſhalt open vnto him the fountaine of the truth, thou ſhalt bring to paſſe, that there ſhall procéed out of his hart, a great ſauour of a moſt ſwéete ſmell: But if thou ſhalt fill him with euill and wicked counſels, and ſhalt perſwade and drawe him, to impietie, hatred, trecherie and all abominations, thou ſhalt be the cauſe of an intollerable ſtinche, there ſhall come out of his hart a moſt poyſonfull ſauour, wherewith not onely his owne hart, but the whole houſe wherin he is, and all the common wealth where he abideth, ſhall bée hurt, infected, and poyſoned.
            
            
               EVen as, out of an apothecaries ſhop, where very wholeſome130 medicines, precious ointments, and moſt pleaſant perfumes are ſolde, ſometimes commeth moſt ranke and deadly poyſon: So very often, from men greatly experienced, and déepely learned, do come verie peſtilent, perniſious and trecherous counſels. Therefore ſaith Eccleſiaſticus: Haue but one counſeller of aEccleſ. 6. 8. &amp; 37. thouſand. And againe: Do no ſecret thing before a ſtranger, for thou canſt not tell what he goeth about. Alſo kéepe thy ſoule from an euill counſeller. Chooſe ſuch a counſeller, as doth loue thy ſoule, and deſireth thy ſaluation. Gregory ſaith: No man can be more faithfull to giue thée counſell, then that man, that loueth and deſireth not thy goods, but thy ſelfe. Euery man hath néede of counſell, but let euerie man, make good and godly choiſe of his counſellour. The law of God, (ſaith Cyprian) is the ſterne of counſels. Happie and bleſſed is that man, that houſe, and that common-wealth, that is ruled with ſuch counſels, as are grounded, and deriued, from the holie lawes of God.
            
            
               AS a man holding in his hand an angling rod, and with a131 baited hooke fiſhing in an obſcure and troubled riuer, although he doth not ſée the fiſh ruſh vpon the baite, yet he

perceiueth very well, that the fiſh is taken, and hanged vpon the hooke, bicauſe the corke or barke of his fiſhing line is pulled downe, and hid vnder the water: So ſathan, that moſt ſubtle, and wilte fiſher, although he ſéeth not our thoughts, being in the ſecrets and bottomes of our harts, yet notwithſtanding, by outward ſignes, he many times doth know them, as by our words: (For out of the aboundance of the hart, the mouth ſpeaketh,) by our actions, and by the geſtures of our bodies. For Chriſt himſelfe affirmeth: That out of our harts do come euill and wickedMath. 15. thoughts. And Salomon in his Prouerbes, doth number amongProverb. 6. thoſe things which God hateth, An hart that is fraught with euill thoughts. Héere hence may moſt eaſily be gathered, that all our euill thoughts, do not come vnto vs, from without, neither are wrought in vs, nor ſtirred vp altogither by ſathan, but that they come and créepe out of our owne corruption. And ſo by outward ſignes and tokens, comming to the knowledge of our enimie the deuill, he neuer ceaſeth, with infinite temptations, of all ſorts, to do his greateſt indeuour, to drawe the ſame cogitations of our harts into moſt dangerous and damnable practiſe, if the Lord of his mercie and goodnes, ſhall not giue vs true repentance, and the aſſiſtance of his ſpirit, wherby we may auoide his ſnares, and eſcape his traps. Which thing the Lorde grant vs.
               Amen.
            
            
               AS the ſmith doth not make himſelfe, the hote coles, that be132 in his forge, but doth blowe the fire with bellowes, and ſo the coles are kindled, and made hot and firie: So, the diuell doth blowe and inflame, thoſe dangerous and wicked cogitations, which are conceiued in our harts and minds, with the bellowes of great and manifold temptations, and ſo laboring to kindle the fire of all iniquitie, he miniſtreth nouriſhment to all our wicked and damnable purpoſes. For the hart of man, is like vnto a ſmithes forge, his euill and bad cogitations are hote burning coles, he that doth blowe the bellowes, to make them to burne vp, and to conſume both our ſoules and bodies, is the diuell, that ancient enimie of our happines and ſaluation.

                  ore, wounded, maimed, lame, putrified and rotten, to mooue the harts and mindes, of paſſers by, and of all that ſhall behold him, the rather to pitie him, and to miniſter vnto him ſome reléefe and comfort: Euen ſo, we that be poore and miſerable ſinners in this world▪ muſt not bring before the Lord our God, our owne merits, good déeds, or vertues, as able and ſufficient, to win the fauour and loue of God, and to cléere vs of our ſinnes and tranſgreſſions: but we muſt moſt willingly, with harts, that be rent and torne, with gréefe and ſorrow, for our miſdéedes, and heinous offences, done and committed againſt the maieſtie of God, open, bring foorth, and lay before him, the botches of our ſoules, the corruption of our natures, and the putrifaction and rottennes of our ſinnes and iniquities, that we may obtaine at Gods hand, eaſe and comfort to our ſoules and conſciences, his great mercie, and frée remiſſion for all our rebellions, ſinnes and wickedneſſes, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.
            
            
               AS they which do dig mettals out of the earth, do not contemne,134 nor deſpiſe the leaſt gobbets and peeces, that they eſpie, but take all: but eſpecially, if they finde by digging a veine of gold, they leaue no way vnſought, but with all care and diligence they looke about them, and do dig the gold and earth togither, and moſt diligently do ſaue and kéepe the ſame: Euen ſo ought we to deale, in the holy word of God, we muſt paſſe ouer nothing therein lightly, nor deſpiſe one word, of all the ſacred and diuine ſcriptures, but eagerly and earneſtly, to do our beſt and greateſt indeuors, yea and to call, and to crie moſt mightily to the Lord, to aide, aſſiſt, and enable vs, to dig out of the ſame word, whatſoeuer is requiſite and neceſſarie for the ſaluation of our ſoules, and eternall life. It is not earth and gold mixt togither, it is all moſt pure, and throughly tried, yea it is purer by a thouſand degrées, than any golde, that hath béene tried ſeauen times in the fire. The prophet affirmeth, that it is better thanPſal. 119. thouſands of gold and ſiluer.
            
            
               
               AS the ſea doth caſt to ſhore, ſhell fiſhes of al ſorts, wéedes and many other things, and not long after doth ſup vp, receiue, deuoure, and caſt into the depth the ſame againe: Euen ſo, this world doth now thruſt vs out of fauour, and by and by receiueth vs againe: and when we thinke our ſelues to be vpon a very ſafe ſhore, and that we haue leiſure, and time to reſt vs, and to meditate vpon ſome woorthie and excellent things, euen then we finde our ſelues deceiued, and are toſſed among the waues of infinite troubles, and are ſwallowed vp of innumerable calamities, bicauſe many things that we neuer thought of, haue preuented vs, and the flickerings and falſe promiſes of this coſoning world haue deceiued our hope, and diſappointed our expectation.
            
            
               AS a weake and brittle wal, is eaſily caſt downe, and ouerthrowen135 with euery engine: but an huge fenſe, a mightie ſtrong wall, and a tower that is firme, and fenſed on euery ſide, doth ſtand ſurely, and endureth the force that commeth againſt it, without yéelding, ſtaggering, or falling: inſomuch, that the enimies that ſeeke to ouerthrow it, are driuen and conſtrained, to vſe warlike engins and policies, yea and to batter and ſhake it, with engins, torments, and ordinances of wars, which will ſend and throw out, ſtones, weapons, bullets and pellets of iron and lead: Euen ſo ſathan, doth moſt eaſily ouerthrow, with euery light temptation, fraile and weake men, which are not well ſetled in vertue, nor grounded in godlines, nor armed with the holy word, and ſpirit of God: but to win and ouercome (if he could) men that are furniſhed with a ſtrong and liuely faith▪ and ſuch as are ſtaied, and do relie vpon the Lords protection and loue, he vſeth ſundrie ſubtilties, and moſtMatth. 4. dangerous and forcible temptations. He that tempted our ſauiour Chriſt, will neither ſpare any man, nor meanes to deſtroie vs, if he can bring to paſſe, and effect his purpoſes. The Lord kéepe and defend vs, from his craft, ſubtiltie and force, and ſo ſtrengthen vs with the holy Ghoſt, that we may paſſe through, and breake in péeces all his ſnares.
            
            
               VVE muſt not thinke, that thoſe men are forſaken of God,136 which are much, and continually exerciſed, with diuers temptations: for euen as a man that hath two ſonnes, the one, an earneſt louer of vertue, ſtrong in bodie, and of a mightie courage: the other, depraued, and of crooked diſpoſition, inclined to

effeminate pleaſures, and wanton delights, weake in bodie, and of little or no courage. The firſt he ſendeth out to wars, and doth aduenture him, in perils and dangers of all ſorts, that he may exerciſe, and acquaint him, with the labours, troubles, and toiles of the world: the other he cockereth, and maketh too much of him, he ſuffereth him to haue all things at his wil, he is kept at home, and (as it were) dandled vpon his mothers lap. But at the laſt, he that in all his affaires, and dangerous aduentures, did in euerie point, quit himſelfe, like a man of great valure, and noble courage, receiued togither, with great praiſe, and deſerued honor, a moſt high and noble reward: but he that was pampered, and cockered at home, had neither praiſe, reward nor honor: Euen ſo our heauenly father, doth leade men, that are ſtrong and conſtant in faith, through diuers and ſundrie perils and dangers, and doth drawe them as it were with his owne hande, through bitter anguiſhes, great perplexities, and very narow ſtreightes of calamities, miſeries, and temptations, and doth continuallie exerciſe them, with fearefull cumbats, againſt the enimies of their ſoules, and through many and great labours, infinite ſturdie ſtorms, and bitter blaſts, doth ſtrengthen, and confirm them, in vertue and godlines: But the frayle and wicked men of the worlde, and ſuch as be méere naturall, without any delight or comfort in his word, and are no whit ſeaſoned, nor chéered, with the dewes of his grace, and his moſt bleſſed ſpirit, he permitteth them to be in great proſperitie, and to haue all things at their will and pleaſure, without ſmarting, ſighing, ſobbing, and groning, for wante or lacke of any thing, that their harts can deuiſe or deſire: but at the length, in the end of the day, they that haue ſtriuen harde, and fought manfully, and haue in battell ouercomed the fleſh, the world and the deuill, ſhall be receiued into endleſſe ſaluation, euerlaſting life, and eternall glory: And they which haue laid downe their heads, and ſlept in the boſoms of worldy pleaſures, and haue ſlumbred in foule and filthie idlenes, neuer caring, nor thinking, what will follow, nor remembring the dreadful day of iudgment, when the wicked ſhal heare their damnation denounced by Chriſt, they (I ſay) ſhall be vtterly condemned, reprobated, and caſt into euerlaſting and endleſſe miſeries. Then ſhall moſt plainly be ſéene and felt, the loſſe that fleſhly pleaſures bring, and the profite of croſſes, caried and borne for Chriſts ſake.
            
            
               
               AS wheate or other graine, laide vp and kept in a garner,137 cellar or chamber, if it be not ſtirred, and dreſſed often, with a ſhouell or van, will be full of corruption, loſe the ſwéete ſauour, ware vnholeſome for mans body, and will be conſumed of wéeuels: And apparel or garments being laid vp in a preſſe, or other place, if they be not much ſhaken and toſſed, will be eaten &amp; ſpoyled with mothes: Euen ſo men, if they be not tried with temptations, and throughly exerciſed with calamities and miſeries, will be very quickly monſtrouſly corrupted, and will grow to be ſo rotten in all maner of ſin, and iniquitie, that they will ſhrinke and fall quite from the Lord. But being well prooued, canuaſed, and throughly tried, with many croſſes, afflictions, and troubles, one following in the necke of an other, they become the firmer, ſtronger, and more conſtant, in the faith, feare, and loue of God, and ſo manfully fighting, and courageouſlie ouercomming, the aduerſaries and enimies of their ſoules, they ſhall at the length be crowned, with an euerlaſting crowne of eternall glory. The2. Tim. 2. which crowne, they onely ſhall haue, (ſaith the apoſtle) which do ſtriue lawfully. And in another place he ſaith: God is faithful,1. Cor. 10. and will not ſuffer you to be tempted, aboue that which you are able to beare, &amp;c. But in this caſe it is requiſite, that we be well furniſhed with the armour of God, bicauſe our enimies do diuers and ſundry waies aſſaile vs, and moſt mightily impugne and fight againſt vs: tryeng vs ſomtimes with one thing, and ſomtimes with another. So that, if we be not clothed with the armour of righteouſnes, on the right hand, and on the left, we1. Cor. 6. ſhall neuer be able to quit our ſelues againſt them, I meane the world, fleſh and deuill, our profeſſed, mortall and ſworne enimies.
            
            
               AS bées when they ſtriue togither, and are ſtirred vp,138 through ſome vehement motion, with throwing of duſt, are brought into order, and appeaſed: euen ſo men, when they are toſſed and tormented, with troubleſome broiles perturbations and paſſions, if they would remember duſt, whereinto of neceſſitie they muſt be turned, and neuer forget death, which they ſhal neuer be able to eſcape, they would eaſily be ſtaied, pacified and quieted, and woulde repreſſe and kéepe within compaſſe, their ſtragling luſts, and vnrulie appetites, which cannot indure to be tamed, nor ruled by reaſon.
            
            
               
               AS a tree, the more déepely it is rooted in the earth, the taller139 it groweth, and mounteth the higher: So a man, the more humble and lowly that he is, the more and higher doth the Lord exalt him.
               And as a trée ſet vpon the top of a mountaine, is mightily ſhaken,140 and eaſily rent vp by the rootes, with euery bluſtering blaſt, and ſtorme of winde: Euen ſo man in this world, the more and higher he is exalted, the more and greater dangers is he ſubiect vnto. The holie virgine did perceiue and ſée, theſe things to be moſt true: He hath (ſaith ſhe) put downe the mightie from theirLuc. 1. ſeate, and hath exalted the humble and méeke. And the apoſtle ſaith: God reſiſteth the proud, and giueth grace vnto the humbleIac. 4. Math. 7. Mark. 8. Luk. 3. &amp; 6. &amp; lowly. Séeing therefore that we be compared to trées, by Chriſt himſelfe in his holy Goſpell, it behooueth vs, to haue déepe and ſtrong rootes, of true and vnfained humilitie, and in conſideration of our frailtie and weaknes, to ſet and place our ſelues, in the bottom of the lowe valley of the knowledge of our owne miſery: That no tempeſts, nor ſtormes, may remooue and roote vs out: That no vanitie may deſtroy vs: No ambition trouble vs: No gréedie couetouſnes torment vs: Nor any occaſion whatſoeuer, may poſſibly draw vs, from the lowlines and humilitie of our harts and minds: from the comtempt of the worlde, and from a true and ſincere loue of honeſty and godlines. A building is ſo much the firmer and ſtronger, as the foundation &amp; groundworke of the ſame, is laid lower and deeper. The groundworke of Chriſtian philoſophie, is vnfained humilitie, and the déeper that the ſame is laid and ſetled in our harts, the ſurer and more permanent, will the building of our religion be. That ſaying of our ſauior Chriſt, of neceſſitie muſt euer be true and infallible: He that exalteth himſelfe, ſhall be brought lowe, and he that humblethLuk. 14. &amp; 18. himſelfe, ſhall be exalted.
            
            
               IT behooueth that ſinne and iniquitie, may greatly diſpleaſe141 thée, that the loue of thy ſelfe, may be turned into a ſincere loue of God. For if thou ſhalt eaſt into an hot burning fornace wood and ſtickes, that be ſcare and drie, and ready to burne, there will ariſe and burne out, a moſt pure and cleare flame of fire: But if thou wilt caſt into the ſame fornace, gréene ſticks, wet, and ſtinking ruſhes, or ſome other ſuch matter, they will burne in déede, but the fornace and whole houſe will be filled with

ſmoke, and will be euen blacke by reaſon of the thicke darknes, which procéedeth of the foule and ſtinking ſmoke: So, the hart of man, is a furnace continually burning, if thou wilt nouriſh it, with cogitations, and heauenly meditations of the loue of God, there will appéere and ſhine out of it, a pure flame and bright light of true and vnfained loue to God and man: But if thou wilt cheriſh and maintaine it, with thoughts and deuiſes of ſelfe loue, then it will be full of vile ſmoke, ſtinch and darknes. TheyRom. 1. periſhed (ſaith the apoſtle) in their own imaginations, and their fooliſh hart was darkened. The fountaine and originall of all euils, and the center, from whence the lines of all abhominations do flow, is mans inordinate ſelfe loue. Auguſtine ſaith, thatAug. lib. 14. Ciuit. Dei. Adam did fall, into that ouermuch loue of himſelfe, before he did eate the forbidden fruit. And the ſame author ſaith, that two loues did build two cities: the loue of God Ieruſalem, and mans ſelfe loue Babylon. It is ſelfe loue, that Chriſt ſpeaketh of, ſayeng:Ioh. 12. 2. Tim. 3. He that loueth his life, ſhall loſe it. And Paule ſaith: In the latter daies men ſhall be louers of themſelues, couetous, hautie,Rom. 5. high minded, proude, &amp;c. And againe: we muſt not pleaſe our ſelues. And Peter calleth the wicked and vngodly, bold, and pleaſers2. Pet. 2. of themſelues. There is no miſery comparable to this, that a man knoweth not his owne miſerie. And of follies, there is none greater, then not to know a mans owne follie, but to haue an ouer well wéening of himſelfe. It is excéeding great, and very laudable wiſdome, that a man caſt downe and condemn himſelfe, that he may auoid the heauy iudgements of God, and condemnation with the wicked world. For the more vnperfect that we eſteeme, and iudge our ſelues to be, the néerer to true perfection do we come. For this in ſome meaſure is perfection, euen to know and to acknowledge our owne imperfection.
            
            
               EUen as after great ſhowers and ſtormes of raine, the aire142 is clenſed and cléered: So, after great troubles, ſorrowes, afflictions, and temptations, cleannes of hart, quietnes of minde, and peace of ſoule and conſcience do follow.
            
            
               AS with a pile or ſtacke, of ſeare and dry wood, the fire is143 quickly kindled, and cauſed mightily to flame out: Euen ſo, the outragiouſnes of carnall, and fleſhly luſt, is greatly prouoked, mooued and ſtirred vp, through rioting, banqueting,

quaffing, guſſing, ſwilling, and continuall féeding and pampering of the belly, and by taking the bodie from good, lawfull and honeſt exerciſes, and giuing it to idlenes, ſlothfulnes, and ouermuch eaſe, and reſt from labours.
            
            
               EVen as, of ouermuch fulnes of the ſtomacke, and ſuperfluitie144 of meats, groweth that obſtruction, which the phyſitions do call oppilation, or ſtopping, whereupon bréedeth a continuall headach, and that frenſie, which bringeth men to a madnes: Euen ſo, of a depraued, and diſhoneſt loue of this life, of the corruption of manners, of gluttonie and exceſſe eating, doth ſpring an vnbridled and vntamed luſt, whereof ariſeth that phreneticalPapiſts. madnes of heretikes, and a corruption of their vnderſtanding in matters of faith. They which care not, to kéepe a good conſcience, do at length fall to an incurable contempt of faith. The apoſtle therfore ioyneth faith and a good conſcience togither. The which conſcience (ſaith he) whiles ſome caſt from them, they haue made1. Tim. 1. ſhipwracke of their faith. If therefore thou wilt, that the almightie ſhall like, and allow of thy faith, be ſure that thou kéepe a good conſcience, without the which thy faith is dead, and will do thée no good.
            
            
               The Emperor Traianus compareth the treaſure of rich men with the ſpleen.
               EVen as, when the ſpleen increaſeth, the other members,145 ioyntes, and parts of the bodie, do conſume and pine away: So, the great treaſures and riches of couetous tyrants increaſing, the wealth of ſubiects and inferior perſons, is weakened and diminiſhed, whiles they pill, and poll away, their ſubſtance and goodes, to enrich themſelues withall.
               And euen as the ſpléen increaſing, the other members do decreaſe:146 So couetouſnes growing greater and greater, all vertues do vtterly decay, and vaniſh away. Bountifulnes, liberalitie, charitie, truth, righteouſnes, and all ſuch excellent qualities, are no more found, in thoſe men, which are ſtrangled and poiſoned, with a great and gréedie deſire of worldly riches. For being drowned in couetouſnes, they can neuer lift vp their harts to God, nor ſtretch foorth their hands, to do good to their brethren. God giueth vnto men, riches, wit, induſtrie, knowledge, and many other things, ſignified and vnderſtood, by the name of Talents,

to the end that they ſhould honor and worſhip God, and bicauſe they ſhould do him faithfull and true ſeruice, which is the giuer of all good things. The Euangeliſt ſaith, that the LordeMatth. 25. called his ſeruants togither, and gaue vnto them his goods. Riches then, and all goods, whatſoeuer men haue in their poſſeſſions, are not their owne, but the Lords, vnto whom they muſt make an account for the ſame. The Apoſtle ſaith: What haſt1. Cor. 4. thou, that thou haſt not receiued? And the holy prophet his words are plaine: The earth is the Lords, and all the fulnes ofPſal. 24. the ſame, the round world and they that dwell therein: thou art then, a ſeruant, a ſteward, a bailife, the things which thou haſt, are Gods, not thine, they be his goods, which he hath deliuered vnto thée, that thou ſhouldeſt vſe and beſtow them, not vpon thy foule luſts, nor filthie pleaſures, vaine delights, nor to hurt thy brother, neither that thou ſhouldeſt hide them: but to his good liking, honor and glorie, that his Goſpell may be preached, his poore ſeruants, and diſtreſſed children reléeued, that the honeſt cauſes of poore widowes, and orphanes may be defended, and that other ſuch charitable déedes ſhould be done and practiſed: that the Lord finding thée faithfull in th
                     •
                  ſe ſmall things, may at the length giue thée greater matters, that is, the kingdome of heauen and the ioies thereof: but if thou be faithleſſe in theſe, he will neuer truſt thee with thoſe. Take héede and beware therefore, that thou do not lauiſh, waſte and conſume, the Lords goods, in the ſeruice of the fleſh, world and diuell. It is a lamentable thing to ſée, how many, yea innumerable men, in theſe daies, with the riches, goodes, naturall gifts, and talents, which they haue receiued of the Lord, do purchaſe, and euen make ſure vnto themſelues, euer laſting confuſion, death and damnation, againſt the will and commandement of the Lord, the owner and giuer of the ſame. Eccleſiaſticus ſaith truly, that gold and ſiluer hathEccleſ. 8. deſtroied many men. If we would follow the counſell of the Apoſtle, we ſhould mortifie couetouſnes, which he calleth worſhippingColoſ 3. Epheſ. 5. of idols. The couetous man, ſaith Auguſtine, before he gaine monie, he loſeth himſelfe, and before he catch any thing, himſelfe is catched. Couetouſnes is a cruell tyrant: and the riches of couetous men, are thoſe idols, vnto the which, that ſaying of the Lord by Ieremie the prophet, may very well be applied: Ye ſhall ſerue ſtrange gods, day and night, which will giue you no reſt. The old philoſophers, purpoſing to deſcribe aua
                     •
                  ice, or couetouſnes, did

faine, that one Tantalus in hell, was gréeuouſly tormented with thirſtines and drought, in the middeſt of riuers of waters: ſignifying thereby, that couetouſnes is a very ſwallowing gulfe, and an inſaciable hel, where couetous men euen burning with a loue of riches, do moſt earneſtly couet, and gréedily run after thoſe things, wherof they haue great and vnſpeakable abundance. And the more they haue, the more are they tormented, with an vnquenchable thirſt, and an hote burning deſire, ſtill to haue more and more. In my opinion, if a couetous man, were ſo mightily, and ſo heauily loden with gold, and (if it were poſſible) fuller of riches, than that ſhip that came to Salomon from Ophir, yet he1. Reg 9. would neuer be ſatiſfied.
            
            
               RIuers and floods, although they be moſt ſwéete and pleaſant,147 yet when they run, and enter into the ſea, they are moſt bitter: kéeping their right and due courſe, they yéeld pure and wholſome water, but once mingled with the ſea, they are, as it were, poyſoned with bitternes: Euen ſo the wealth and riches of this world, although in the courſe of this life, they do highly delight ſome men, which haue them in poſſeſſion, not the leſſe, when they come to the ſea of death, whither all floods at the length ſhall come, they ſéeme to be dolefull, ſower, bitter, intolerable, and as it were, poyſon it ſelfe. For rich and couetous men, do then finde, and féele, that their riches, wealth, and proſperitie, which the Lord gaue them to an excellent end, haue béene vnto them many times, occaſions of euill. That good man Auguſtine
                  Auguſtine. ſaith, that pride is a ſicknes, or diſeaſe, that commeth of riches. Alſo, gold is the matter, or cauſe, of cares, labours, toyles, feares, and of all vnquietnes: it is perilous to the poſſeſſors of it, and a great weakening of vertues, in all them that ſet their harts vpon it. And Chryſoſtom ſaith, that riches are a ſchoole of malice, enuie and hatred. Chriſt Ieſus therefore our heauenly ſchoolmaſter ſaith: Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirite, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen. And againe: Lay not vp for your ſelues treaſuresMatth. 5. Matth. 6. in the earth. Alſo, You cannot ſerue God and mammon. And yet this is euer to be vnderſtood, that riches of themſelues are not euill: but as they be to the wicked and vngodly, hinderances of vertues, ſo they are to the faithfull ſeruants of God, helps and furtherances, of many good things, godly actions, and very charitable works. For godly men, do poſſeſſe their riches,

be they neuer ſo ample and infinite: and are not poſſeſſed of their wealth and goods: their riches are drudges to them, and not they to their riches.
            
            
               EVen as gold is tried with a touch ſtone: So is man tried148 with gold. And as Chilo the Lacedemonian ſaith: Gold doth moſt manifeſtly prooue and declare, what they be, that owe it. And looke what the touch ſtone is to gold, the ſame is gold to man. The touch ſtone with rubbing the gold or ſiluer vpon it, ſheweth plainly what kind of gold or ſiluer it is: and gold it ſelfe doth in like maner moſt eaſily bewray, what maner of man one is. There is no touch ſtone in all the world, that doth more truly touch and trie, al degrées of vertues and vices, than gold, wealth, and abundance of riches. The Iſraelites being very inclinable to the ſuperſtitions of the Egyptians, were no ſooner out of Egypt, but they made a calfe of gold and iewels, the which theyExod. 32. worſhipped, in ſtead of God. And in the land of promiſe, they oftentimes conſumed and waſted their gold and treaſure, in making of idols. Whereupon did ariſe that great complaint, which the Lord maketh by the prophet Oſeas, ſaying: I haue multipliedOſc. 2. their ſiluer and their gold, which they haue made Baal: as if he ſhould ſay, I haue giuen the Iſraelites great ſtore of ſiluer and gold, which they moſt wickedly haue waſted, in making of the idoll Baal. And by the ſame prophet the Lord ſaith: Their ſiluer and their gold, haue they made idols, for themſelues to ſerue. But men that are godly, and of ſound and Chriſtian religion, do beſtowe their goods, their wealth and riches, vpon building, and repairing temples and churches, dedicated to the holy ſeruice, and true worſhipping of God: in féeding the poore ſaints of God: in redéeming captiues: in prouiding for poore widowes, and orphanes, and in doing ſuch other vertuous and godly déedes of charitie. The nobles of the Iſraelites, returning from the captiuitie of Babylon, did bring their ſubſtance and riches, to build1. Eſd. 2▪ Tob. 1. &amp; 2. Matth. 2. the temple of the Lord. And Tobias did féede the hungrie, and gaue clothes to the naked. The wiſe men of the eaſt contrie, opening their treaſures, offered vnto the Lord, gold, frankincenſe, and mirrhe. And now in our time, that is truly offered vnto the Lord, and is vnto him a ſweete ſmelling ſacrifice, which is giuen to the poore diſtreſſed ſeruants of God. I remember a report giuen out of one 
                     •
                  medeus, when certaine orators talking with

him demanded whether he kept any hounds, or not: he preſently ſhewed vnto them, a great multitude of poore beggers, ſitting all togither, theſe ſaith he, are my hounds, with theſe do I hunt, after the kingdome of God, theſe do I kéepe and féede euery day: the Lord ſend many ſuch hunteſmen.
            
            
               HIeronymus ſaith, that it is a part of ſacrilege, not to giue149 vnto the poore, that which is their owne. That is, whatſoeuer thou art able to ſpare: Money, meate, clothing, harbour, counſell, comfort, and whatſoeuer els thou art able to do. That is not loſt, which thou doſt diſtribute among thy poore brethren and ſiſters, in the worlde. For as Salomon ſaith: He laieth in bancke vnto the Lord, which hath pitie, and ſhewethProuerb. 19. mercy vnto the poore. It can not be lamented and bewayled inough, to ſée how infinite thouſands in the world, do moſt vainly, yea moſt vilely and wickedly, ſpend and lauiſh out, the goods and riches, wherewith the Lord hath put them in truſt, to the end that they ſhould vſe them to his owne glory, and the good of his church. Some vnder the colour of religion and holines, with their goods and golde, do maintaine ſuperſtition and falſe worſhipping, in ſtead of the true ſeruice of God: ſom do ſpend them, vpon pride and voluytuouſnes: ſome purchaſe houſes, landes, many garments, much apparell; and very many with their wealth and riches, do pinch, nip, and oppreſſe their neighbours: but all this while, the poore are hungrie, naked, colde, in priſon, contemned, deſpiſed, and fewe, yea very fewe, do regard or comfort them. It behooueth vs, which do beléeue in one almightie, euerliuing, inuiſible, and incomprehenſible God, and liuing in a moſt chriſtian common-wealth, do profeſſe true and ſincere religion, ſo ſurely grounded, and built vpon the holie, infallible, and inuincible word of God, that neither wicked man, hell, nor deuill can preuaile againſt it, continually to be dooing good, and ſtill caring moſt, how we may pleaſe God beſt, and to anſwer our faith and profeſſion, with holines and righteouſnes of life and conuerſation: And ſo to contemne this deceitfull and momentanie world, that moſt willingly we may follow the ſteps of our ſwéete Ieſus, who ſaith: The foxes haue holes, and the foules ofMath. 8. the aire haue neſts, but the ſonne of man, hath not where to lay his head. True godlines is great riches, if thou wilt be contented, with that thou haſt. Théefes cannot ſteale it, mothes, cannot eate it, neither can it be conſumed with canker or ruſtines.
            
            
               
               THe carbuncle, is a very precious ſtone, to ſée to, like an150 hot burning cole of fire, ſhining excéeding brightly, the which as Plinie affirmeth, féeleth no fire, neither is it molten, changed, or mollified therewith. If thou ſhalt take it, and cloſe it faſt in a ring of leade, and caſt it into the fire, thou ſhalt ſée the leade molten and conſumed before thy face, but the carbuncle remaining ſound and perfect, without blemiſh, as before: for the fire worketh vpon the leade, but vpon the carbuncle it cannot worke: Euen ſo, Chriſt our ſauiour, being in the hot ſcorching fire of his torments, ſuffered and died as he was man, but as he was God he neither ſuffered nor died. The fire of his afflictions, wrought then vpon his manhood, but his diuinity and godhead continued perfect, and vtterly vntouched. That he might put away our ſinnes, he imbaſed himſelfe, taking vpon him (as the apoſtle ſaith) the ſhape of a man, and was made likePhilip.

                     . vnto man, and was found in his apparell as a man. He humbled himſelfe, and became obedient vnto death, euen the death of the croſſe. But the moſt excellent brightnes of his diuinitie ſuffered no ecclipſe, neither could by any waies or meanes be darkened. He euer was, is, and euer ſhall be Chriſt, and equall to his father, touching his godhead. So, in like maner, all they that be ſurely grounded, and throughly graffed in Chriſt Ieſu, although in the Lords quarrell, for the triall of their faith and religion, they ſhall beare many weightie croſſes, ſuffer infinite and moſt ſharpe afflictions, vndergo innumerable and bitter perſecutions, and ſhall be acquainted with all maner troubles, calamities, and ſorrowes, ſo that they ſhall ſéeme euen to be molten, with the firie and hot burning heate thereof: yet notwithſtanding, their carbuncle, that is, their faith in Chriſt, their hope, their loue of God, and comfort in the Lorde Ieſu, will neuer ſhrinke, neuer quaile, neuer be ſhaken, neuer giue ouer: but will euer remaine ſtedfaſt, perfect, immutable, ſtrong, and ſo bold as a lyon: The1 Cor.

               AS the ſea, although it receiueth, an vnſpeakable multitude151 of flouds &amp; riuers, which do run into it, yet neuer runneth

ouer, neither is ſo full, that it will receiue no more: So, euil and wicked men, are neuer ſatiſfied, with malice, enuie, and hatred, neither make they any ende, of their trecheries, ſins and iniquities: but with the goades of ſome, they are ſtirred vp and prickt forward, to commit others, woorſe and more deteſtable then the firſt: So that one déepe calleth on another, bicauſe being deluded, with the lyeng ſhadowes of falſe good things, they make no account of, but contemne and deſpiſe, thoſe things that be true, ſound, and good indeede: And do euen féede and as it were franke themſelues with euil, and all abhominable things, and yet (ſuch is their gréedines) they are neuer ſatiſfied, they haue neuer ynough.
            
            
               AS fire brands and wood, being kindled and ſet on fire, do giue152 light and warmth vnto others, which are cold and in darkenes, but are waſted and conſumed themſelues; ſo that others receiue the benefite, and they the loſſe and ſpoile of themſelues: So an vnlearned and vngodly miniſter, whiles without repentance or remorſe of conſcience, he deliuereth the word, and miniſtreth the ſacraments vnto others, which are prepared, knowe what they do, and do reuerently heare the word, and woorthilie receiue the ſacraments, doth onely hurt himſelfe, the reſt receiue comfort by the worde, and are edified by the ſacraments. They are ſaued, though he periſh.
            
            
               OVr ſoules in our bodies, may well be compared, to that153 gréene precious iewell, called Smaragdus, in the hand of a rude childe, or of a ſlouenly and vnmannerly carter: Our ſoules are moſt excellent, and precious iewels, in the regiō and countrie of mortall men, no whit, or very little eſtéemed, but in themſelues very precious and immortall: Which our God, that higheſt and moſt heauenly ieweller, by his excellent and incomparable wiſedome, hath woonderfully poliſhed, and hath coupled and ioyned them vnto the leaden rings of our bodies. And euen as it gréeueth and maketh ſorrowfull, a ſkilfull and expert ieweller, when he beholdeth and ſéeth, thoſe iewels and precious ſtones, which he with all his wit, induſtry, and arte, hath trimmed and poliſhed, to be tumbled and toſſed, in the foule and filthy fingers, of children and fooles, who neither knowing them, nor eſtéeming them, do ſoyle, blemiſh &amp; deſpiſe them:

Euen ſo, our heauenly father, when he ſéeth our ſoules, the which he hath created, after his owne ſimilitude and likenes, to be in the midſt and depth, of the corrupted cogitations, wicked and beaſtly thoughts, and helliſh imaginations of our harts, he taketh it heauily, and in euill part: inſomuch that he crieth out, ſayeng: Why thinke yée euill in your harts? And by his holieMath. 9. Ezech. 11. prophet Ezechiel: I know the thoughts of your harts. That hiſtorie of old Hely in the holy booke of God, is euer to be remembred: When he heard tolde vnto him, they heynous déedes, and moſt intollerable euils, which his ſonnes had committed, he did but ſleightly and ſlenderly reprooue them, when he ought ſharply to haue chaſtiſed, and corrected them. Therefore the Lorde ſpake vnto him, and ſaide: Thou haſt honored thy children more1. Samuel. 2. then me, therefore will I cut off thy arme, and the arme of thy fathers houſe. And ſhortly after the Scripture ſaith: That his ſonnes were ſlaine in fight, and that Hely himſelfe fell backward out of his chaire, and broke his necke. God grant that this example of Hely and his ſonnes, may be a warning to all parents, to1. Sam. 4. traine vp their children in the feare and nurture of the Lord, and to puniſh their ſinnes and vices, ſo often as they perceiue and know them. But againe, the vngodly motions, and miſchieuous thoughts of our harts, what are they els, but children and brats of our owne bréeding? The which we ought very ſeuerely to reſtraine, and without pittie to puniſh them ſharply, when they are vnruly, and wil caſt from them, the empire and gouernment of reaſon, offending God, and dangering our ſoules: If we do not, howſoeuer we breake not our necks in this world, we ſhall periſh for euer in the world to come.
            
            
               IF thou dwelleſt with prophane, vngodly, faithleſſe, and wicked154 men, and doſt ſtill hold faſt, and kéepe ſurely, the faith, religion, profeſſion, and integritie, and honeſtie of life and maners: and doſt ſo beare and endure, all their ſpites, malice, obloquies, contumelies, railings, ratings, and what elſe ſoeuer ſhall be offered and done vnto thée, that thou neuer ſwarue nor fall, from the ſtate of nature, grace, feare, faith and loue of God: It is an euident argument, and a manifeſt proofe, of a great and Chriſtian magnanimitie and courage, that is in thée, of excellent vertues, and of the holy Ghoſt himſelfe that dwelleth in thée, and doth arme and ſtrengthen thée, againſt ſathan, and all his cunning

ſleights and violence. For euen as a looking glaſſe, though it be moſt cléere and cleane, with the foule breath, of thoſe that blowe vpon it, is obſcured and dimmed: euen ſo, a man that is honeſt, vertuous and godly, with continuall cuſtome, acquaintance, and familiaritie, of diſhoneſt, vngodly, and graceleſſe men, is oftentimes corrupted, infected, and blemiſhed. And therefore Eccleſiaſticus ſaith, Whoſo toucheth pitch, ſhall be defiled withEccleſ. 31. pitch, &amp;c.
            
            
               IF it ſhall happen, that a planet otherwiſe very beneuolent155 and wholſome, ſhall be ioined to other ſtars or planets, which are maleuolent, and of bad influence, it alſo will ſend foorth influence that is euill and vnwholſome: Euen ſo, a man that is vertuouſly giuen, and well bent to godlines, if he ſhall take and ioyne vnto him, prophane, wicked and vngodly men, in too much acquaintance, cuſtome and familiaritie, he alſo at the length, wil become prophane, and vngodly, as they be. For, all for the moſt part, are woont to imitate the maners of them, with whom they are conuerſant and familiar, vnles they haue ſome ſpeciall gifts, and ſtrength from God, to preſerue and to kéepe them, from ſuch baits and ſnares, as ſathan is woont to ſpread and lay abroad, in the perſons, and maners of men, badly and lewdly diſpoſed.
            
            
               THat we may perfectly behold and ſée a thing, it behooueth156 that there be ſome ſpace, betwéene our eies, and the obiect, or thing that is to be ſéene: So, that we may ſée the world plainly, and throughly looke into it, it is requiſite, that there be ſome diſtance, betwéene vs and it. But euill, lewd, and vngracious men, which pleaſe themſelues, in all things, that diſpleaſe God, ſéeing they are the world it ſelfe, how can it be, that they ſhould ſée it, when there is no ſpace nor diſtance betwéene them, and it? So then, if thou wilt ſée the world, and all the vanities, flickerings and deceits of the ſame, be not one with it, faſhion not thy ſelfe after the maners of it, be ſtil at ods with it, let there be a diſtance and ſpace betwéen you, ſo ſhall it neuer deceiue thée.
            
            
               EVen as the eie, doth not ſée, the lids of the ſame, bicauſe157 there is no ſpace betwéene the eie and them: So the vaine and peſtilent ſort of people, cannot ſée the world, bicauſe they are not ſeparated from it, by any diſtance, or ſpace at all. In

the middeſt of Babylon, they ſée it not: in the middeſt of Sodom, they cannot perceiue the filthines, nor féele the ſtinch thereof: they haue eies and ſée not, they haue eares &amp; heare not, they haue hands and handle not, féete and go not &amp;c. They are in the world, of the world, and the world it ſelfe: therfore they loue the world, they inhalſe, and imbrace the world. They cannot, they will not, ſpie any faults in the world. To them, the ſtinch of the world, is a ſwéete ſmelling ſauour, the foulnes of it, is excellent beautie, the corruption of it, is perfect goodnes. That ſaying of the Pſalmiſt agréeth well with worldlings: Fire came down vpon them,Pſalm. 58. and they did not ſée the ſun ſhine. This fire that the prophet ſpeaketh of, is an extraordinarie and rotten loue of themſelues, which bringeth ſuch a darknes vnto them, that couereth and ouerwhelmeth their vnderſtanding: it blindeth their eies, and ſtoppeth their eares: it doth manacle their hands, and fetter their féete, ſo that in all goodnes they are ſenſeleſſe. The ſunne that the prophet meaneth, is that whereof mention is made in the booke of Wiſedome: The ſun ſhine of vnderſtanding, is notWiſd. 5. riſen, or hath not appéered vnto them.
            
            
               EVen as oyle doth cauſe the fire to flame: So flatterie doth158 miniſter nouriſhment to errors. Beléeue not a flatterer, for vnder the perſon of a moſt ſwéete friend, he is a moſt bitter enimie. It is not for nothing, that Salomon ſaith: He that flatterethProverb. 29. his neighbor, laieth abroad a net before his ſteps, to trap and to take him withall. It is the office, and as it were the profeſſion of a cunning flatterer, with his ſmoothe words, and ſoft and ſugred ſpéeches, to vndermine, ſupplant &amp; deceiue men, and to draw them into ſome dangers and ſnares, whereout they ſhall not eaſily eſcape, but with ſome harme. Euen as the end of an Orator is, with eloquence to perſwade: and the end of the phyſition, with medicine to cure and to heale: ſo the end of the flatterer is, with his humble communication, and ſwéete alluring talke, to deceiue. Be ſure of this one thing: whenſoeuer an euill and wicked man, or one that is vaine and prophane, doth ſéeme to ſtoupe and to crouch vnto thée, in his words and ſpéeches, then is he ſpreading his net, and caſting in his minde, how to deceiue thée, and to bring one euill or other vpon thée. Plato calleth a flatterer, a wilde beaſt, that is very peſtilent, and hurtfull to mankind, and ſaith he is like an vncleane deuill, that féedeth

mens minds, that are not wiſe and warie, with deadly dainties, and with foule things that are dangerous and poyſonfull. He alſo compareth a flatterer, with a ſorcerer and a witch. And in my iudgement, there is no théefe woorſe, nor vnwoorthier to liue in the world, than a flatterer: bicauſe he doth not onely rob men, of their mony and goods, but alſo of reaſon and iudgement. Auguſtine ſaith, there be two kindes of perſecutors: one is of them that diſpraiſe thée, the other of them that flatter thée: but the flatterers toong, doth hurt thée more, than the perſecutors hand. Hieronymus ſaith, that nothing doth ſo eaſily corrupt mens minds, as flatterie. Indéede there is no muſick more ſwéet and pleaſant to mens eares, than flatterie, and yet none more pernitious and peſtilent, than it.
            
            
               AS a looking glaſſe doth imitate, whatſoeuer is ſet before it,159 and doth repreſent the likeneſſes of them that looke in it, but by a contrarie way, for it ſheweth the right ſide, to be the left, and the left ſide to be the right, and if thou looke into the eaſt, it doth repreſent thee, looking towards the weſt: Euen ſo a flatterer, in voice and in geſture will imitate thée. If thou laugh and be merie, he alſo will be pleaſant and merie: if thou wéepe, he will wéepe for companie: if thou wilt backbite and ſlander a man, he will take thy part, and will, with railings, obloquies, and ſlanders, euen gréeuouſly wound the ſame man. And if thou wilt praiſe thy ſelfe, he will helpe thée: or if thou loueſt, to heare thy ſelfe praiſed of others, he will carrie thée, as it were vpon the wings of praiſes and cōmendations, vp into the cloudes, &amp; loftie ſkies. Through his ſubtil ſleights, and craftie deuiſes, he turneth and bendeth himſelfe euerie way: When he will worke vpon men, that be ſad and heauie, he is preſently tranſlated into their humor: with men that are remiſſe, he dealeth merily: he handleth old men grauely, and yoong men courteouſly: with wicked men he is bold and impudent, and with libidinous and lecherous people, he is filthie and ſhameleſſe. The flatterer hath alwaies, at his fingers ends, and ready vnder his girdle, the geſtures, voices, inclinations and diſpoſitions of all perſons, high and lowe, he leaues out none, that he may deceiue all. He will praiſe thée in thy preſence, and ſcorne thée in thy abſence: that old prouerbe, Out of one mouth commeth both heate and cold, ſerueth well for flatterers. Plinie reporteth that there is a fountaine in Dodona,

which doth kindle fire brands, that are extinct, and doth extinguiſh them when they are kindled: So a flatterer is double toonged, he now extolleth thée, and doth ſet thée aloft with great praiſes, and by and by, he will caſt thée downe, with iniuries andEſai▪

               AS the ſkin of a foxe is of ſome valure, and in requeſt, but161 the fleſh is nothing woorth: So outward ſhewes of holines, are highly eſteemed with hypocrites, but cleannes of the hart, and inward puritie, is of them no whit regarded. A certaine man being diſpoſed to tearme his great enimie, cruell and deceitfull, he called him a lyon and a foxe: A lyon for his tyrannie, and a foxe for his fraude. And one Lyſander in the like caſe, ſaid: That if the ſkin of a lyon be not inough, it muſt be péeced and inlarged with the ſkin of a foxe: Whereby he meant, that if force and violence would not ſerue, but come ſhort of that crueltie, that a tyrant would faine practiſe, he muſt adde deceit, to do that he deſireth. So that old men in times paſt, did by a foxe vnderſtand, wilie, craftie, and deceitfull men, that would couerHypocrites▪

No doubt, there be in theſe daies of ours, not a fewe moſt cruell and bloodie tyrants, that carie within them, as cruell, bloodie, &amp; traiterous harts▪ to the true ſaints &amp; ſeruants of God, as euer Pharao did to the Iſraelites; Curſed Cain to good Abel, and as Iudas to Chriſt. But yet they perceiue, that their open vſing of their crueltie

cannot preuaile, and therefore they practiſe their cunning,Papiſts, foxes, and hypocrites. fraud, deceit, and hypocriſie ſecretly, and (as they thinke) ſo cloſely, that it cannot be ſpied. But the Lord hath hitherto euer diſcouered them, to his owne glorie, the comfort of his people, and to their owne ſhame and confuſion. And notwithſtanding that old prouerbe, that is: An old foxe is hardly ſnared, I doubt not, but to ſée or heare tell, that the old foxes and yoong cubs, ſhall all at the length, either be ſnared &amp; taken by the worde of the Lord, and ſo conuerted, or els, ſo ſnared and knared otherwiſe, that they ſhall ſooner haue that they do deſerue, then that they do deſire.

Cyrillus. holes, and the birdes of the aire haue neſtes, but the ſon of man hath not where to lay his head: The ſame expoſitor vnderſtandeth by foxes hypocriſie, by the birds or foules of the aire, arrogancie. As if Chriſt ſhould haue ſaide: thou ſaieſt, Thou wilt follow me: But foxes, and foules, haue their holes and neſts in thée, that is: Hypocriſie and arrogancie do dwell in thy hart, and how then can Chriſt reſt or dwell in thée? Hypocrites and arrogant perſons, do neuer follow Chriſt, whatſoeuer they pretend, and how faire a ſhew ſoeuer they make of holines &amp; perfection.

And alſo Chriſt ſaith to his diſciples: Beware of falſe prophets, which come to you in ſhéeps clothing,Matth. 7. but inwardly they are rauening woolues, you ſhall know them by their fruits. And the apoſtle ſaith, That they haue a ſhew of

               AS ſticks and wood do nouriſh and maintaine the fire, but163 the fire doth waſte and conſume them: So, a man that is flattered by ſmooth diſſemblers and hypocrites, doth maintaine his flatterers, for the moſt part, but in the end they wil deuour, and vtterly vndoo him. When men in old time, did feine, that one Acteon was torne in péeces and deuoured of his owne dogs, which he kept and daily fed: They ment verily, that whoſoeuer will pleaſe and delight themſelues, with paraſites, flatterers, hypocrites, and diſſemblers, and be at coſt to féede &amp; maintaine them, at the length ſhall be deuoured and ſwallowed vp of them. And yet it is a world to ſee, that neither the flatterers, nor the flattered, the deceiuers, nor the deceiued, will ſee and conſider their wretched and miſerable ends, which are as cleere as the ſun light at noone day. The flattered ſhal be deuoured of his own dog the flatterer: And the flatterer himſelfe ſhal be a pray to ſathan, that cruell cur and hound of hell. Thus that vngodly crue, and rabble of ſcribes, phariſies and hypocrites, do for temporall and momentanie trifles, loſe great and moſt excellent things. They exchange and forſake heauen, for earth: their ſoules for their bodies, (or rather that their bodies may be pampered héere for a ſhort time, for at the length, ſoules and bodies muſt fare alike:) They gréeue the ſpirit, to pleaſe the fleſh: they abandon vertue, and imbrace vice: and to be ſhort, they giue their backs vnto God, and their faces vnto the world, they vtterly forſake him, to be in league and loue with it.

the deuill, world, and fleſh, and are taken in their traps, do die aA threefold death. moſt miſerable, and as it may wel be called, an immortal death. For though they do eſcape ſuch an end, and death in this worlde, as their deſarts do craue, yet beſides the death of nature, they ſhall taſte of the death of hell, which is endleſſe, eaſeleſſe, and remedileſſe. Let vs therefore whiles it is to day, lift, and ſtir vp our ſelues, and flie vnto God, with our harts and mindes, that we fall not into the nets and traps of our enimies. I know it is, an excéeding hard thing, to giue ouer thine acquaintance with this world, wherein thou art bred and brought vp; euen as it is hard, to bring an infant to forſake the breſts that haue giuen him ſucke. The childe will loue his nurſe, for hir dugs ſake, though hir ſelfe be whooriſh: So we are readie to loue the world, for the vaine pleaſures and delights thereof, though the world indéed be a very ſtrumpet. I wiſh that all would, and I pray God that all may, (if it be his will) euen ſteale, and as it were priuily conuey themſelues, from their vanities, euill cogitations, naughtie deuiſes, and whatſoeuer ſinne they vſe and take pleaſure in, if it be but one hower of a daie, and I doubt not, but by little and little, they would learne to hate ſinne, renounce the diuell, and deſpiſe the world. And where as now men and women, old and yoong, do beſtow all the houres of daies and nights, about the vanities and deceiueable pleaſures of the world and fleſh, yea, yea, and to ſerue ſathan to: they would not beſtow one twinckling of an eie in ſo bad and dangerous a ſeruice.
            
            
               EVen as fire, when it breaketh out of compaſſe, and order, is165 more perilous in old buildings, than in new houſes: So miſdeamenor, couetouſnes, lecherie, pride, dronkennes, and blaſphemie, is more offenſiue, and doth more harme in old age, then in gréene youth: For an old man, as in yéeres and experience, he is beyond them that are yoong and gréene headed, ſo he ought in life and example, aſwell as in counſel to inſtruct others. For when an old man falleth into folly, he hurteth himſelfe greatly with his ſin, and other more with his example. That he is corrupted bréedeth his owne woe, and great trouble of minde and conſcience, to the church of God.
            
            
               AS a marchant that is expert and ſkilfull, in his profeſſion166 and facultie, will not open, nor ſhew his rich wares, and

coſtly marchandiſe, vnto thoſe whom he well knoweth, will not buie them, which do come vnto his ſhop or warehouſe, either as curious perſons, or as crafty ſpies, and ſubtle ſearchers, not with any purpoſe to buie, but to do ſome euill: and calleth vnto him onely thoſe, whom he knoweth to be very willing and deſirous to buie: Euen ſo the Lord his maner is, not to open his heauenly myſteries, and the déep ſecrets of his ſacred, and moſt holy word, vnto them, whom he perceiueth and ſéeth plainly, to ſéeke after them vainly, and curiouſly, or with a wicked minde, and corrupted purpoſe, to ſearch them out, to the end they may tread, and trample them vnder their féete: and doth call them onely to the true knowledge of his lawes and ordinances, and doth inſtruct and teach them, whom he is ſure, will both profit themſelues, and others thereby. Giue not that which is holy (ſaith Chriſt) vnto dogs, neither caſt ye pearles before ſwine. When Herod
                  Matth. 7. was very deſirous, that Chriſt ſtanding before him, would ſhew ſome miracle, Chriſt would not onely, not do any miracle orLuk. 23. woonder, but alſo not vouchſafe him one word for anſwere. And when the Iewes ſaid: we would ſée a ſign of thée, he anſwered: A wicked &amp; adulterous generation ſéeketh a ſigne, but no ſigne ſhalMatth. 1
                        •

But before his diſciples, and others that were with them, he did ſhew many and great woonders, when they did not aſke for any. But the Iewes did aſke, and went without, bicauſe they had no minde to be conuerted, either by his words or works, but onely to ſée his miracles, and to heare his words, to the end (if they could) to trap him, and to quarrell with him. If thou wouldſt profit therefore by the word of God, when thou doeſt read or heare it, bring with thée faith and humilitie: for God reſiſteth the proud, and giueth grace vnto the humble and lowly.

And as for Chriſt, they had no more ſight no

                     •
                  ad of the ſun and moone, when they were yet in the wombes of their mothers. The diuine miracles of Chriſt, were moſt pure, and cléere looking glaſſes, without blemiſh, ſpot, or deceit, wherein they might haue ſéene, both the omnipotencie of him that wrought them, and alſo their owne moſt miſerable and wretched eſtate, howbeit they were ſo ſtone blinde, that they could not ſee the glaſſe, much leſſe themſelues in the glaſſe. So that when they ſought after Chriſt, and to ſée his miracles, this might well haue béen ſaid to them: Quid caeco cum ſpeculo? What ſhould a blinde man do with a looking glaſſe? The Euangeliſt ſaith, that they came vnto the Lord, that they might deſpiſe his myſteries and woonders. And they ſaid: We know not whenceMatth. 2. Iohn. 9. this fellow is. But bicauſe they came vnto him onely vpon their féete, and departed far from him, in their harts and mindes, for they came vainly, curiouſly, and deceitfully, therefore the Lord did moſt ſharply reprooue them, and that which they demanded, they neuer obtained. The papiſts no doubt, notwithſtanding their braue ſhewes, and vauntings of religion, holines, and deuotion, are in the ſame predicament with the incredulous Iewes. Let vs therefore take the counſell of the holy Ghoſt, which ſaith: Thinke of the Lord in goodnes, and ſéeke him in theWiſd. 1. ſinglenes of hart: for he is 
                     •
                  ound of them that tempt him not, and appéereth vnto them, that put their truſt in him. Let vsHeb. 10. come vnto Chriſt, with a true hart, and in the fulnes of faith. Many do come to church to heare the word of God, at the mouth of the preacher, but all profit not, bicauſe all do not come with humble mindes and lowly harts, to that end.
            
            
               AS of many men, comming into a goldſmithes ſhop, one buieth16

vnwiſely, vndiſcréetly, or barbarouſly, wherewith they may ſport themſelues, and ſcorne him: ſuch, as they came with wicked purpoſes, and cauilling mindes, ſo they depart with harts as hard as adamants, ſ
                     •
                  ared conſciences, and braſen faces, ſo bloodles that they cannot bluſh, far woorſe than when they came. The preaching of the Goſpell is in deede, a very rich ſhop, fully and throughly furniſhed and ſtored, with iewels of great valure: to wit, with moſt wiſe, holy, and heauenly ſentences, procéeding from the almightie himſelfe, through the mouth of his ſeruants, though ſéelie wormes, and mortall men. And whoſoeuer will come woorthily, to the preaching of the Lords lawes, and ordinances of God, and of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, he muſt come, with an holy and godly minde, deſirous to vnderſtand, and to know the will of God, that he may do it. They that come thus vnto the Lord, do moſt certainly learne, thoſe things which appertaine to the ſaluation of their ſoules. Such onely, doth the holy Ghoſt inſtruct, teach and comfort, and doth inflame them with a woonderfull loue, of the holy word, and heauenly things. But the Lord ſendeth emptie away, all ſuch hearers, as approch and come néere vnto him, with their eares and lips, and are diuided far from him, in their harts and mindes, being full of hypocriſie, deceit, and all abhomination. To them ſpeaketh the LordEzech. 14. himſelfe by Ezechiel the prophet: Shall I make anſwere vnto them when they aſke me any thing? as if the Lord ſhould ſay, I will not.

                     •
                  anker, of grieuous euils, and heinous ſinnes, and from being ſpotted of this wicked world. For when we are afflicted, then do we flie vnto God▪ in o
                     •
                  r dangers and extremities, as to our only refuge, beſides whome there is none can helpe, or comfort vs. We craue and beg moſt earneſtly his mercie, and do make great haſte, and euen run as it were, to meditate of his omnipotencie, and readines to do vs good, and to deliuer vs. And although we ſée our ſelues, to be as it were baniſhed ſoules, and croſſed with a thouſand troubles, and to be euen abiects among men, &amp; to be thruſt

out of the ſocieties and companies of worldlings, yet we neuer forget, the goodnes and mercies of God, nor caſt out of our minds, the remembrance of his louing kindnes toward his ſeruants. The loue and fauor of God, is euer before the eies of his ſaints, and their calamitie doth euen ſtay, and reſt it ſelfe, in the ſwéete remembrance, of heauen and heauenly things: though they be ſore wroong in this life, and gréeuouſly pinched, yet they are neuer ſo oppreſſed, that they be diſcomforted. In the midſt of mourning and ſorrow, they do woonderfully reioice: in extreme pouertie, they féele no want: they ſéeme daily to be cut off, and yet ſtill they increaſe and floriſh: they are ſtill afflicted, and yet continually refreſhed.
               Thus doth it come to paſſe, that an admirable greatnes, of loue and obedience, towards the Lord, doth grow very feruent, and hote in them. For they vnderſtand, that they be therefore afflicted, that they ſhould flie vnto God, the heauenly and onely comfort, as a moſt ſtrongly fenced tower, and inuincible caſtle, that they may be turned from their ſinnes and be ſaued. Tobias knowing ſo much, ſaide: O Lorde, when thou art angry, thouTobias. 3. ſheweſt mercie, and in the time of trouble, thou forgiueſt them their ſins, that call vpon thée. And the Lord (ſaith Iob) woundeth,Iob. 5. and he healeth, he ſmiteth, and his hands ſhall heale againe. And the kingly prophet Dauid ſaith: Thou art my refuge in myPſal. 32. trouble, which compaſſeth me round about. And againe: The Lord is hard at hande, to them that are of a troubled hart, andPſal. 24. will ſaue the humble and lowly in ſpirit. And the Lords words, by Oſe the prophet are theſe: In their tribulation, they will riſeOſe. 2. vp earely, and call vpon me. For the Lord his maner and cuſtom is, to helpe and ſuccour the afflicted, which call and crie, for his heauenly comfort. Héerehence is that of the Euangeliſt Iohn: Your ſorrow ſhall be turned into ioy: And that of the apoſtle:Iohn. 16. 2. Cor. 1. As you are companions of the paſſions and ſufferings, ſo ſhall yée be, of the conſolation and comfort: And that alſo in the Actes: We muſt enter into the kingdome of God, through many tribulations.Acts▪ 14. And holy Iohn in the reuelation, ſpeaking of the ſaints which haue, and ſhall haue the fruition of God, in heauen, ſaith: Thoſe are they that came from great tribulation. Héereupon,Apoc. 7. 
                  Auguſtine ſaith excéeding well. That the Lord hath appointed thée to ſuffer▪ it is a ſcourge of him, that chaſtiſeth thée, and not a puniſhment of him that condemneth thée, Who woulde not

then, be well contented with troubles and afflictions? Who would not willingly vndergo, the indignation, malediction, and perſecution of wicked men? Who would be afeard, of the ſpite, malice, and whatſoeuer this wicked world can ſay or do? Séeing the ſequell vnto the ſons and daughters of God, is to be exalted, and extolled into heauen, and to be placed there, at the right hand of the almighty, through and with the Lord Ieſu, world without end. The forenamed ſaints of God, and other holy men, from age to age, in the midſt of their calamities, did ſtill remember themſelues to be men, borne vnder that condition, that their liues ſhould euer be open, and ſubiect, to all the ineuitable darts of infinite troubles, and that there was no refuſing, to liue and leade their liues, in that condition, whereunder they were borne: And whiles they called to minde the euents of other men, they knew right well, that no new thing, had happened vnto them. And indéede, the remembrance of mans condition and eſtate, and of a common law, and lot as it were, incident to al, doth mitigate the paine of troubles, and doth make their burden the eaſier to bear. And this is a thing, euer obſerued, and noted, in the children of God, that they are ſo far from impatience, and from repining at their afflictions, that euen in the depth of their miſeries, they thinke themſelues happy, that they are counted woorthy, to ſuffer any thing for Chriſts ſake. It were a great booke matter, to remember all thoſe, that are mentioned in the holy ſcriptures, which euen ſhrinking, and falling away from God, haue béene recouered, reclaimed, and healed, by afflictions and tribulations, as it were with phyſicke and medicine from heauen. O how great is thy goodnes, how incomparable is thy clemencie, how infinite and endles is thy mercy, O heauenly and moſt holie father? Which doſt therefore afflict vs, that tho
                     •
                   maiſt chéere vs vp againe: Thou doſt therefore hold vs downe, that thou maiſt comfort vs, and doſt ſuffer vs, to fall into diuers and ſundry calamities, that we may learn to know thy righteouſnes and mercies. All theſe things thou doſt, not of hatred to vs warde, but of loue, not to deſtroy vs, but to bring vs to thy glorie.
            
            
               AS the aire is cléered, with the brightnes and ſhine of the ſun,170 and when the ſun is downe and ſet, the aire is couered with darknes: Euen ſo the minde of man, when it is purged &amp; cleared, with heauenly wiſedome, ſought and drawne out of the word of

God, doth ſhine moſt excellently, and ſendeth foorth, a pure and perfect light of chriſtianitie, which may moſt eaſily be decerned, to procéed, and to come from God himſelfe: But being without that true light, it is ouerwhelmed with an horrible and fearfull darknes, and giueth out nothing, but filthy miſts, and ſtinking vapors, which do ſpring and riſe, out of the corruption, and rotten nature of man, and euen from hel, and ſathan himſelfe. How can it be, that darknes, and blindnes, ſhould remaine and reſt, in that hart of man, which the holie Ghoſt, the authour of all light, and the onely light it ſelfe, hath choſen to be his owne ſeat, and holy habitation? Can error flowe, out of the moſt pure fountaine of wiſedome: It is not poſſible, that from the onely centre of all goodnes, a line of wickednes ſhould be drawne: And can the fruits of death, grow out of the trée of life? Theſe are vnpoſſible things. And on the otherſide, where the holie ſpirit of grace and might, hath not place, and poſſeſſion, there is nothing to be found, but blindnes, error, ſin, iniquitie, and all abhomination, yea, and all the fruits of eternall death it ſelfe.
            
            
               EVen as a bitter potion, is not ſaide to be vnprofitable, nor171 without hope, when health and ſoundnes doth follow, although it be excéeding bitter to him that taketh it: So ſharp and pinching calamities, wherewith the Lord doth exerciſe, now and then his children, are not to be counted idle and in vaine, when ſome peace of conſcience, and comfort vnto our ſoules do follow, that when the iuſtice of God is ſéene, many may be amended, and the faith and patience, of many may be tried. For nothing is more auaileable, for the aduauncing of the praiſe and commendation of true vertue, then calamitie it ſelfe, taken and borne patiently, for Chriſts ſake.
            
            
               AS yoong chickins are in ſafetie, from the hauke and puttocke,172 ſo long as they ſtraie not, from about the wings of their dams, and when they do ſtraie, far from them, they are eaſilie taken, of euery vermine: Euen ſo, they that depart not from God, but kéeping themſelues neere vnto him, do walke, and lead their liues, within the compaſſe, and limits of his laws and ordinances, are moſt ſafely kept by him, from the force, inchantments, engins, and all the ſubtle deuiſes of ſathan and his inſtruments: but if they forſake God, and not regarding his

word, diuide themſelues from him, by their ſins and iniquities, they muſt néedes fall into the tallons and iawes of that tyrannicall hawke and hound of hell, from whence there is no deliuerie. Whoſe whole indeuor and labor is, like a roaring lion, to ſéeke1. Pet. 5. whom he may deuoure.
            
            
               EVen as, it is a thing very commendable, and worthy praiſe,173 that a ſoldier, do euer beare about him, the ſignes and badges of his captaine, that it may appéere, to whom he belongeth: So is it no little honor, to a true chriſtian man, to paſſe through manie dangers, and to be experienced in many troubles, and to indure many affliction
                     •
                   for his captaine, Chriſts ſake. For ſorrowes, vexations, and tribulations, are the armor and badges of Chriſt. And therefore the apoſtle, which for Chriſts ſake ſuffered many things, ſaith: I do beare about in my body, the marksGalat. 6. of the Lord Ieſu.
            
            
               EVen as the ſun, which vnto eies being ſound, and without174 diſeaſe, was very pleaſant and wholſome: vnto the ſame eies, when they are féeble, ſore and weake, is very troubleſome and hurtfull, and yet the ſunne, euer all one, and the ſelfe ſame, that it was before: So, God that hath euer ſhewen himſelfe, benigne and bountifull, to thoſe that were kinde, and tender harted, towards his ſaints, and mercifull, to thoſe that ſhew mercie: vnto the ſame men, when they fall into wickednes, and grow to be full of beaſtly crueltie, the Lord ſheweth himſelfe to be very wrath and angrie, and yet ſtill one, and the ſelfeſame immutable God, from euerlaſting, to euerlaſting. So that, we ſée the Lord, to beare and ſhew himſelfe vnto men, according to that, which he knoweth them to be. The prophet Dauid had great knowledge, and no ſmall experience of this, when he ſaid: The Lord will reward me, according to my righteouſnes, andPſal. 18. according to the cleannes of my hands, in his owne eie ſight: with the holy thou wilt be holy, and with the froward, thou wilt deale frowardly. When the wicked and vngodly, do prouoke the Lord, to anger, and euen pull vpon themſelues, through their rebellion and hardnes of hart, ſome iudgements, plagues, or ſcourges, then they thinke, that the Lord dealeth hardly, and frowardly, when as notwithſtanding, he is moſt holy, and moſt iuſt.
            
            
               AS a looking glaſſe, doth ſhew, whatſoeuer thou ſhalt ſet175 againſt it, if thou ſhew thy ſelfe pleaſant and milde vnto it, it alſo will ſhew it ſelfe, milde and pleaſant vnto thée,

and if thou beeſt angrie, and full of wrath and indignation, thou ſhalt perceiue in like maner, the countenance of the glaſſe, to be, as it were furious, and cruell to behold, whereas notwithſtanding the glaſſe is one, and the ſame: So God, whereas he is one, and the ſelfeſame immutable and euerlaſting God, and as it is ſaid in the booke of Wiſedome, A glaſſe without ſpot or blemiſh,Sap. 7. is ſometimes compared to a gentle lambe, and ſometimes, to a fierce and terrible lion. Eſaias ſaith of him: Euen as a ſhéep vntoEſa. 53. the ſlaughter was he led, and as a lambe before the ſhearer, ſo he opened not his mouth. And Iohn Baptiſt ſaith of him alſo: BeholdIohn. 1. the lambe of God, that taketh away the ſinnes of the world. And Chriſt ſpeaketh of himſelfe: Learne of me, for I am méekeMatth. 11. and lowly in hart. Theſe and ſuch other places do ſhew the mildnes and kindnes of our God. But the prophet Eſay ſpeaking of him againe, ſaith: The furie of the Lord, is wax
                     •
                  n hot againſtEſa. 5. his people. And a little after: His voice is, as the roring of a lion. And Amos the prophet ſaith: A lion of the tribe of Iuda, hathAmos. 3. the victorie. Chriſt himſelfe affirmeth, that he is mercifull towards them that be mercifull, ſaying: Bleſſed are the mercifull,Matth. 5. for they ſhall obtaine mercie. And touching the Lords maner of dealing with cruell and vnmercifull men, Iames the apoſtle ſaith: He ſhall haue iudgement without mercie, that ſheweth noIac. 2. mercie himſelfe. Thus do we plainly ſée▪ how diuerſly the Lord ſheweth himſelfe: to wit, mercifull, to thoſe that be mercifull, and to thoſe that be mercileſſe and cruell, he ſheweth himſelfe ſharpe and ſeuere. Chriſt declareth in his Goſpell, that he will ſay vnto the good, in the laſt iudgement day: Come ye bleſſed children of my father, poſſeſſe a kingdome prepared for you, from the beginning of the world: for I was hungrie, and ye gaue me to eate, &amp;c. O ſwéete and comfortable ſaying to the children of God. And to the wicked he will ſay: Depart from me ye curſed ones, into euerlaſting fire, prepared for the diuell, and his angels: for I was hungrie, and ye gaue me not to eate, &amp;c. O dolefull, and fearfull curſe, well had it béene for them, if they had neuer béene borne.
               Our ſauiour Chriſt in his holy Goſpell, that he may teach vs,Ioan. 10. Matth. 13. Luc. 8 Matth. 25. Luc. 14. his care &amp; loue towards vs, compareth himſelfe to many things: calling himſelfe ſomtimes a ſhepheard: ſomtimes an huſbandman: ſomtimes a man: ſomtimes an houſholder: and ſomtimes alſo a king calling his ſeruants to their accounts, rewarding wel

the good, and condemning the bad: and ſomtimes alſo a king, bidding all to a marriage, and to a wedding dinner. For thus it is written: The kingdome of heauen, is like vnto a man a king,Matth. 20. 21. Luc. 19. which made a great marriage for his ſonne. He is called a man a king, that we may vnderſtand him to be bountifull and mercifull toward vs. But not long after it is ſaid: When the king heard it, he was angrie. When he is noted to be angrie, he is not called a man a king, but king onely. And as we read the ſcriptures, we find that Chriſt is called by diuers and ſundrie names, and all to expreſſe his nature and diſpoſition vnto vs. He is ſaid to be woonderfull, a branch, iuſt, comely, beautifull, Ieſus, Meſſias, a ſauiour, ſaluation, a rocke, a corner ſtone, a counſellor, ſtrong, beloued, the ſun, a captaine, a giant, a bridegroome, the eaſt, the prince of peace, the father of the world to come, a lord, an high prieſt, a phyſition, Emanuel, an eagle, a mediator, a fountaine of water of life, the bread of life, the way, truth and life, a light, the roote of Ieſſe, a ſwift deſtroier, and by many other names is he called, as we ſhal finde in the ſcriptures, as we read, and marke them well: and yet he the ſame God, and as Iames the apoſtle ſaith, Without any ſhadow of change. He brought, and aduanced the people of the Hebrewes, to great dignitie: and againe did throw them, into extreme ignominie, but the change was in them, and none in him. He placed them in the land of promiſe, and brought them into the captiuitie of Babylon, and all theſe things did he, without any alteration in himſelfe, to ſhew both his mercie and his iuſtice.
            
            
               EVen as a twig or branch, taken from a very good and fruitfull176 trée, and graffed in the trunke or ſtocke of ſome wilde trée, as a crab, thorne, or ſuch like, doth draw the trunke or ſtock, to the nature of the twig or branch, that now it beareth other leaues, and other fruit, than it was woont to do: So, the doctrine of Chriſt, well planted, and ſurely graffed, in our barren harts, doth draw vs, and conuert vs, vnto, and into it ſelfe, and cauſeth vs to beare other goodly leaues, of holy and godly words, and other moſt pleaſant and wholſome fruits, of vnfained vertues and graces. But by the way, we muſt néedes crop, and cut off, the boughes of our old ſinnes, that Chriſt may be graffed in vs, and then no doubt, our fruit ſhall be ſuch, as God, for his ſonnes ſake, will accept and take in good part, at our hands. A good trée, cannot

beare bad fruit, nor an euill tree, good fruit. No man can be delighted with the foule pleaſures, and filthie delights, of the world and the fleſh, and with the ioyes of heauen, at the ſame time. No man can be giuen, both to the contemplation of heauenly things, and to the wiſedome of the fleſh. Truth and lying, things euerlaſting, and things moſt vile and tranſitorie, ſpirituall things, and fleſhly matters, the things that are aboue with God, and the deceiuable trifles, that are belowe in the earth, may not be mingled togither. Thou canſt not both ſauour of the Lord, and of the world: thou canſt not beare both good and bad fruit: it is not poſſible, that thou ſhouldeſt both be barren and fruitfull. If thou loueſt God, and his doctrine be graffed in thée, then art thou fruitfull: if not, thou art vnfruitfull. For the truth it ſelfe ſaith: He that abideth in me, and I in him, he bringeth foorthIoan. 15. much fruit.
            
            
               SAlt is made of ſea water, but ſo long as it is in the ſea, it is177 not ſalt, it muſt be taken out of the ſea, and placed vpon the dry lande, that being in ſalt pits, where the ſun may ſhine, &amp; the aire blow vpon it, the water may be thickned, and ſo conuerted into ſalt. This world is a ſea: ſo long as we liue in the world, being tormoilde in the ſwelling ſurges, of the pride thereof, and toſſed with the ebbings &amp; flowings, of the worlds inconſtancie, and ouerwhelmed in the bitter waters of the ſinnes, and wicked practiſes of the ſame, we are as yet no ſalt. We muſt go out of the world, and enter into the lande, to wit, into our ſelues, and take a iuſt view of our owne imbecilitie, and haue a due conſideration of our owne miſerable, and wretched eſtate, that the ſun of righteouſnes, may thruſt out his beames, and the winde of heauenly grace, may blow vpon vs, and ſo we may be turned, into an admirable, and woonderfull ſalt, that being ſeaſoned our ſelues, we may be meanes, and the Lords inſtruments, to ſeaſon others. We may be bold to inueigh againſt all iniquitie, when we haue amended our owne amiſſes. Yet muſt that be done in meaſure, and according to knowledge: for ſo it behooueth al men, to do all things, that they do. It is well ſaide of one, that ſalt is an excellent ſauce, and ſeaſoner of all things, ſo that meaſure be not wanting: Otherwiſe, meaſure and meane miſſing, the ſalt it ſelfe is loſt, and that which ſhould haue béene ſeaſoned, is vtterly ſpoyled. For too much doth make very bitter that, which meaſure would haue made ful ſwéete. And yet notwithſtanding,

all men muſt, but eſpecially the miniſters of the worde, lift vp their voices, and crie out againſt all maner of ſinne, and wickednes. For the Lord ſaith by Ioel the prophet: Sound out theIoel. 2. trumpet in Sion, crie out vpon my holy mountaine, and let all the inhabitants of the earth be troubled and quake. And Eſaias ſaith: Crie out, ceaſe not, lift vp thy voice like a trumpet. TheEſa. 58. Scripture doth ſignifie ſo much, when it ſaith, That God commanded Moſes, to make two trumpets of ſiluer, wherewith heNum. 10. ſhould call the people togither, when their tents were to be remooued. For with the ſound of thoſe trumpets, the people were rouſed, and ſtirred vp to wars, and to celebrate certaine daies, wherein ſacrifices were offered vp vnto God. Euen ſo, euerie preacher of the worde of God, ought to call vpon ſinners, to remooue their tents, from this wicked world, and the maners and faſhions of the ſame, and ſo much as in him lieth, to bring the people, that are blinded in their ſins, and falling from God, out of their errors, perils, and dangers, &amp; with all their force, and ſkill, to mooue and ſtir them vp, to be that in déede, which true chriſtianitie doth require. That euery one may ſay with the prophet Eſaie: Let the vngodly man forſake his owne waie, and theEſai. 55. wicked man the cogitations of his owne hart, and be turned vnto the Lord: And with Iohn in the Reuelation: My people,Apoc. 18. auoide out of the midſt of Babylon, be yée not partakers of their ſinnes. As if he ſhould ſaie: Remooue and ſeparate your ſelues from the tranſitory and lieng things of the world, forſake the wickednes of it, and pitch your tents, by godly meditations, and holie affections of your harts and minds, not in the earth, but in heauen. For euery preacher of the Goſpell, ought to prepare his hearers, ſo much as in him lieth, and by his owne example, to ſtir them vp, againſt the enimies of their ſoules.
               And to counſell them, with the apoſtle, To put on the armor of God, that they may be able to ſtande againſt the deceits of the deuill, for we wraſtle not againſt the world, fleſh, and blood,Epheſ.

               AS an expert and ſkilfull huſbandman, doth firſt draw out178 of his fields, or lands, and pulleth vp by the rootes, thiſtles, briers, brambles, and all other venemous, and wilde

wéedes, and afterward committeth vnto them his good ſéedes: Euen ſo a wiſe teacher of the word of God, ought firſt to roote out ſinne and vices, and to till as it were, the minds of his hearers, and as much as in him lieth, to draw and pull out of them, both roote and rinde of all maner of euill, and wickednes, and to prepare and make them méete, to receiue the good ſéeds of the holie word, and to ſowe in them thoſe things, which being rooted and growne vp, may bring foorth both pleaſant, profitable, and plentifull fruites. And although vertue and godlines, vnto the wicked and vngodly, ſéeme euen horrible and bitter, and all vice, and naughtines, ſwéete and well ſauouring, ſo that they are not willing, that the gardens of their harts, ſhould be wéeded and trimmed, bicauſe they would haue no vprightnes, no integritie of life, no truth nor honeſtie to grow there: yet not the leſſe, the Lords miniſters muſt euer thinke, that the ſame is ſpoken toEzech. 16. them, which was deliuered to the prophets, long ſince: MakeEſai. 58. Ieruſalem to know hir abhominations: And ſhew my people their wickednes, and the houſe of Iacob their ſins. Offer vnto them ſalt, wherewith their corruption may be drawne out, andMatth, 5. they made to ſauour ſwéetely in the noſtrilles of God, if they be not altogither rotten, and conſumed in their ſinnes. Thruſt atEccleſ. 12. them, with the goade, of the holie word, and ſtrike at them, with the two edged ſword of the law of God, that (if they be not ſtarkeHebr. 4. dead, in their abhominations, and be not alreadie ſwallowed vp of hell, if there be any recouery in them at all) they may be awaked, out of their deadly ſlumbers, and may be ſo pricked at theirAct. 2. harts, that they may finde and féele, how forlorne they are, in the ſight of God, and flie to him for ſuccour, grace▪ and mercy, if they belong to his kingdome.
            
            
               WHat doth it profite a riuer, to flowe from a pure and179 cléere fountaine, if it ſelfe be foule, filthie, and vnholeſome? Euen ſo, the noblenes of fathers, and the honours of elders, and aunceſtours, what doth it pleaſure their ſonnes, when they themſelues degenerate from their noble and honorable parents? bragging onelie of their nobilitie, and chalenging their honour, but deſpiſing their vertues, ſhewe themſelues wicked, looſe, and leude of life? He that is not nobled, for ſome woorthy acts of his owne, nor renowmed by reaſon of ſome famous vertues, knowne and found to be in himſelfe, what honour

may he looke for? ſéeing there is nothing in himſelfe that is good, but onely a vaine and proud challenging of the excellencie, &amp; woorthines of other men. Chriſt calleth the proude &amp; bragging Phariſies, the generation of vipers: And when they boaſted thatMatth. 3. they had Abraham to their father, he ſaide: Ye are of your fatherIoan. 8. Ezech. 16. the deuil. And when the Iewes reſembled the Amorrheans and Cetheans, and imitated their ſins and iniquities, the Lord ſaith: That Amorrhaeus is their father, and Cethaea their mother.
               So that theſe places laſt cited, do plainly ſhew, that ſomtimes the holy Ghoſt doth call ſonnes, not of nature, but of imitation, and likenes: bicauſe the Iewes did the déeds of the diuell, Chriſt ſaith the diuell is their father. And when they ſo followed the ſteps of the Amorrheans and Cetheans, that for the likenes of their iniquities and abhominations, they did ſéeme euen to bée bred and borne of them, and had like condemnation with them, bicauſe they had the ſame ſinnes, the Lord ſaith that Amorrhaeus and Cethaea, be their parents.

It is a thing far more honorable, and woorthier commendation, that a man floriſh, and be famous, with his owne vertues, and iuſt deſerts, than to borrow his praiſe, and honor of others. Men are very fitly, though not naturally, called the ſonnes of them, whoſe déedes they do, and whoſe vices or vertues they imitate. If ye be the ſonnes of Abraham (ſaid Chriſt to the Iewes, boaſting and glorying of their originall) then do the déedes of Abraham. They were indéede by nature,Ioan.

ſonne or daughter of a noble, honeſt, and good man, then do noble acts thy ſelfe, lead an honeſt life, and do good works. And following the ſteps of Chriſt, thou ſhalt be a chriſtian: otherwiſe, looke whoſe maners, and waies thou walkeſt in, his ſonne or daughter art thou rightly called.
            
            
               
                  ECcleſiaſticus ſaith, that pride is the beginning of all ſinne.181 And indéede, it is that centre, in the ſphere of mans life, whereout do go lines, to the circumference of iniquitie. For a proud man, hath no righteouſnes, no equitie, he hath no liking of any vertue: he ſcorneth and deſpiſeth all, all are his inferiors, and he ſuperior to all, in his owne conceit. Euen as in a thraſhing place, chaffe is ſéene aboue the wheate, not bicauſe it is the better, but bicauſe it is the lighter, and wheras it is the viler, and of the leſſe valure, yet notwithſtanding it getteth the higher and woorthier place: Euen ſo in this life, a proud and vaine man, is exalted aboue the humble and lowly, not for any woorthines, iuſt deſert, or true vertue that is in him, but for his vanitie, and a falſe opinion, that he hath conceiued of himſelfe: And whereas he is of very little, or no valure, yet he putteth out himſelfe before others, which are far beyond him, in vertue, wiſedome, and nobilitie. But the lowly, though the woorthier, and more excellent man, doth euer humble himſelfe, not bicauſe he is of leſſe valure, but bicauſe he hath in him, greater weight of wiſedome, vnderſtanding, and true nobilitie. Wheat, the weightier, ſounder, and better it is, the lower place it deſireth, and ſéeketh: the humble man, the wiſer, and more gratious that he is, the more pleaſure and delight he hath, in chriſtian humilitie and lowlines. But the proud man being lighter then the winde, lifteth vp, and extolleth himſelfe, aboue all things: Whereupon it commeth to paſſe, that he peruerteth, all the lawes of God, and man, for that ſouerainty ſake, which he falſely imagineth, to belong vnto himſelfe. Tobias, that vertuous, charitable and wiſe man, did earneſtlyTobias. 4. diſſwade his ſon from all pride, and did perſwade him to humilitie and lowlines: Suffer not pride (ſaith he) in any wiſe, to dominéere, o
                     •
                   to beare a ſwaie, in thy vnderſtanding, nor in the words of thy mouth. And Eccleſiaſticus counſelleth euerieEccleſ. 7. &amp; 10. man greatly to humble his ſpirit: And ſaith, That pride is1. Cor. 4. odious before God, and men. and the holie apoſtle ſaith: What haſt thou, that thou haſt not receiued? And if thou haſt receiued

it, why boaſteſt thou, as though thou hadſt not receiued it? There is an old and true ſaying, almoſt in all mens mouthes, that is, Pride will haue a fall: and the ſame is very ſtrongly confirmed by Chriſt himſelfe, who ſaith: He that exalteth himſelfe, ſhall beLuc. 14. Luc. 18. brought lowe: and he that humbleth himſelfe, ſhall be exalted. Auguſtine ſaith, that pride deceiued angels, and that much more it will deceiue men, and therefore to be ſhunned. And Ambroſe ſaith, it made of angels, diuels. And no doubt it is the originall of all euils, and the ruine of all vertues, where it is maintained.
            
            
               WE ſée ſomtimes two men, about to go into ſome ſumptuous182 and ſtately hall or houſe, through a very lowe and narrow doore, the one ſtouping, and bending himſelfe, doth paſſe through and go in, without harme: the other ſtout, not ſtouping, nor bending at all, but preaſing in with great force, hurteth his head, and falleth backward: Such a ſtately and princely place, is the kingdome of heauen, the habitation of the ſaints of God, whoſe way is very ſtraight, as Chriſt himſelfe doth affirme, andMar. 10. the doore thereof is ſo lowe and narrow, that he compareth it with the eie of a néedle. That man, that humbleth himſelfe, andLuc. 18. ſtoupeth lowe, doth enter into that moſt ſtately and princely houſe, of the king of heauen: but he that is puffed vp with pride, and ſwelled with inſolencie, cannot get in at that gate, he falleth to the ground, his pride doth throw him backward. Auguſtine ſpeaking of heauen, ſaith, it is a very high countrie, but the way to it, lieth very lowe. And ſo much would the Lord and king of the houſe ſignifie, when he biddeth all learne of him, bicauſeMatth. 11. he is méeke and lowly in hart. And when he called a little childe vnto him, and ſet him in the midſt of his diſciples, he ſaide vnto them: Vnleſſe ye become as little children, ye ſhall not enter intoMatth. 18. the kingdome of heauen. Pride is a very peſtilent ſicknes, and hath this operation in man, if it raigne in him, it diuideth him from God, from himſelfe, and from his neighbour, and doth diſperſe, and diſtract him, into infinite euils, and innumerable vices. The holy virgin could tell that, when in hir moſt woonderfull canticle ſhe ſaid: He hath diſperſed the proud, in the imagination of their owne harts. Let vs therefore beware of pride, eſchew all inſolencie of the minde, and auoide cleane the vaine hautines of the hart, leaſt whiles we hunt, and hauke after, the idle praiſe of men, and the vaine glorie of the world, we vtterly

loſe the euerlaſting glorie, of the ſaints of God, and eternall life for euer. Then will repentance come too late, when we haue loſt all things for nothing, and no recouerie doth remaine.
            
            
               EVen as a fouler, doth lay abroad and ſpread his net, to take183 the birds, where baite is, and they may féede: So the deuillGeneſ. 2. when he would take Eue, ſpread his net in gluttonie, and tempted hir with a beautifull apple, till at the length, to the harme and wo of all their poſteritie, both ſhée and hir huſbande were taken, and trapt to our woes. And with the ſame baite he went about to intangle Chriſt, when he ſaid, If thou be the ſonMatth, 4. of God, commaund that theſe ſtones be made bread. And indéed exceſſe of meat &amp; drinke, is the mother of many moſt dangerous euils. The Scripture ſpeaking of them, that worſhipped theExod. 32. golden calfe, ſaith: The people ſate down, to eate and drink, and roſe vp to play. And in Deuteronomie it is ſaid: That when theDeut. 31. people had eaten and were full, they turned to ſtrange gods. And Oſe the prophet ſaith: They were full, and they did forgetOſe. 13. Luc. 6. God. And Chriſt ſaith: Wo be to you, that are full, for yée ſhall be hungrie. Rioting, exceſſe, and fulnes of meate and drink, doth make mens bodies vnapt to all good and holy exerciſes, and very prone and apt to all ſinne, and wickednes.
            
            
               CHriſt willeth vs not to lay vp treaſure for our ſelues, héere184 vpon the earth, but in heauen &amp;c. and affirmeth that it isMatth. 6. harder for a rich man, to enter into the kingdom of heauen,Matth. 19. then for a cable rope, to go through the eie of a néedle. In déede ſuch a rope, though it cannot be drawne through a néedles eie, yet if it be diuided, and ſingled into the ſeuerall thréedes whereof it was made, it may be ſo drawne through, one thréed after another: Euen ſo a rich man, whoſe hart is ſet vpon his riches, more then vpon God, ſo that couetouſnes is as it were, a moſt infringeable ſhell, wherein his hart is cloſed, and the ſame is manicles to his hands, and fetters to his féete, cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen: But if he will deuide his riches, into certaine thréeds or portions, and beſtow one part to further the preaching of the Goſpell, another vpon the poore man: and one vpon the poore widdowe, another vpon ſéely poore orphanes: one vpon the ſtranger that is in want: another vpon the poore priſoner: one vpon him that is ſicke, and another vpon the impotent:

if he will ſuccour them, that be in ſorrow, and miſerie, and will helpe the néedie, and will godly, mercifully, and diſcréetly, diſtribute his riches, to the comforting and reléeuing of the diſtreſſed children, and ſaints of God, and all this out of a liuelie and true faith, for Chriſts ſake, he may, notwithſtanding his riches, be they neuer ſo great, enter into the kingdome of heauen, and be ſaued, his riches ſhall not hinder him. But if he be caried away from dooing of any good, with a gréedie and damnable couetouſnes, making his riches, his God, there is no entrance for him, but he ſhall be taken, and bound hande and foote, and ſhall be ſent into hell, and ſhall be caſt into vtter darknes, where ſhall be houling, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth. He that is ſuch a one, is euen in this life, already dead, and is as it were his owne graue. Chryſoſtme ſaith, that the minde of a couetous man, is a foule, rotten and ſtinking ſepulchre. Ioſua commanded,Ioſua. 6. &amp; 7. that no man ſhuld take any thing from Iericho, but couetous Achan, tempted with the glittering gold, did breake that commandement, and was therefore moſt iuſtly put to death. Yea for his couetouſnes and gréedie deſire of riches, Ioſua loſtIoſu. 10. the victorie. Ioſua with his humble calling vpon the Lord, could cauſe the ſun to ſtand ſtill, that it went not forward, but he could not ſtaie the couetouſnes of man, but it would be créeping, ſaie he what he would. The ſun was ſtaide at his voice, but Achan his couetouſnes, would not be ſtaid. All the while that the ſun ſtoode ſtill, Ioſua had the vpper hand of gods enimies: but when Achan his couetouſnes, was in eſſe, then Ioſua loſt the victorie.
               It is lawfull for Chriſtian men to poſſeſſe riches, but it is not185 lawfull for them, to be poſſeſſed themſelues, of vnſatiable couetouſnes of the ſame. Thou maiſt haue goods and riches to ſerue thée for neceſſaries, but thou muſt not be a ſeruant and drudge vnto them. For euen as a flie, comming to a platter full of ſwéet and pleaſant honie, if ſhe thruſt not hir ſelfe altogither into it, but onely touch and taſte it, with hir mouth, and take no more, than is neceſſarie and néedfull, ſhe may ſafely go away, and flie to an other place, but if ſhe wallow and tumble in the hony, then is ſhe limed and taken in it, and whiles ſhe is not able to flie away, ſhe doth there loſe hir life: Euen ſo, if a man, of all his riches, take onely ſo much, as may ſuſtaine him, &amp; honeſtly maintaine his eſtate, beſtowing the reſt, as I haue ſaid before, his riches then cannot holde him backe, nor bar him out of the kingdome

of heauen▪ But if couetouſnes ſhall bewitch him, and ſtill pricke him forewarde, to ſcrape togither more and more, and ſhall make him, euen vnſatiable, then they take him, and holde him, and ſo belime the wings of his minde, that he cannot once in all his life, haue one flight towards the kingdome of heauen. And thus being in thraldome and bondage to wicked Mammon, the end of his pleaſures in this world, is the beginning of his ſorrowes in the worlde to come. Plutarch ſaith, that the contempt of riches, is an inſtrument of Philoſophie. And Seneca affirmeth, that the néereſt way to be truely rich, is to deſpiſe worldly riches. If heathen Philoſophers did eaſilie eſpie, the perils, dangers, and diſcommodities of the loue, of worldlie and vncertaine riches, and the benefit of a meane and poore eſtate, how much more then, ought we that be Chriſtians, to know theſe things? whoſe captaine, maiſter, and Sauiour, loued pouertie, and taught the ſame, hauing his birth in a ſtable, with beaſts among chaffe, and his death naked vpon the croſſe. Before Chriſt did appéere in the fleſh, pouertie might haue ſéemed verie bitter, and full of ignominie, vnto men: but after that, the Emperour of heauen and earth, had taken pouertie vpon himſelfe, and alſo touching himſelfe ſaid: The foxes haue holes, and the foules of the aire haue neſtes, but the ſonne of man hath notMatth. 8. Luc. 9. where to laie his head. Who doth not now ſée, that Chriſtian pouertie, in the ſeruants of God, doth well become them, and is honorable, and that it is a true badge of Chriſtian nobilitie?
            
            
               IF a king ſhould haue a certaine houſe, faſt lockte, and cloſe186 ſhut vp, full of gold, precious ſtones, and coſtly iewels, and would promiſe all thoſe treaſures to one that ſhould open the ſame: and would offer vnto thée two keies, one of pure gold, hanging at a coſtly ſtring, made of ſilke and golden threads, but that would not open the ſame locke, that thou mighteſt go into the houſe: and the other of iron, ruſtie and ill fauoured to ſée to, hanging at a thong of leather, or whipcorde, the which notwithſtanding, would open the doore, and let thée in, that thou mighteſt chooſe which of theſe keies thou wouldeſt: were it not better, and more profitable for thée, to chooſe the old ruſtie iron keie, then the keie of gold? Yes no doubt. The golden one indéed is more precious, but what auaileth that, when it will not open the doore, and bring thee to the treaſures: The iron one, is the

viler, but yet it is the better. Such a king is our God, and ſuch an houſe, is that heauenly habitation of his ſaints, wherein are ineſtimable treaſures, endleſſe ioies, and vnſpeakable good things, which are woorthier, and more excellent, then man is able to expreſſe. For ſo ſaith the holie Ghoſt: No eie hath ſéene, nor eare1. Cor. 2. heard, nor hart of man conceiued, thoſe thinge which the Lorde hath prepared for them that loue him. All which heauenlie treaſures, God hath promiſed, to all them that ſhal enter into his holie hill, or houſe of ſaints. The golden keie, which the moſt part of this world do chooſe, and truſt to, that they may enter into heauen, is worldly wealth, and aboundance of riches, ioyned with couetouſnes, which will neuer open the Lords houſe, where are kept his celeſtiall, and ineſtimable treaſures. But that key doth rather open a foule and vile houſe of this world, which is full of all filthines and abominations. The iron keie, is ſpirituall pouertie, againſt the which, the kingdome of heauen is neuer ſhut, but ſtandeth euer wide open, to all them, that bring with them that key, ſo ſaith Chriſt himſelfe: Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit,Matth. 5. for theirs is the kingdome of heauen. Let vs therefore make no account of the golden key, but let vs, for Chriſt and his kingdom, forſake and deſpiſe the deceitfull riches of this world, which are deſired, and ſought for, far and neare, by ſea and land, with dangers and loſſe, of the bodies and ſoules of many thouſands, as though men could bribe God for their ſinnes, and purchaſe heauen, with their worldly trifles: and let vs without murmuring and grudging, with all patience of hart and minde, beare and imbrace pouertie, and all thoſe croſſes and afflictions, which vnto the world ſéeme bitter and intolerable, of which kind very many do happen in the life of man. Let vs earneſtly ſéeke after the riches of the Lords kingdome, and euerlaſting life, for they be ſtable and permanent: &amp; let vs not ſet our harts, and affections, on this world: for it waxeth olde, &amp; rotten, it ſtaggereth, is ruinous and readie to fall.

And a little after, Call the workmen (ſaith he) to take their hire. Idle perſonsMatth. 20. are not called to take hire, but they which haue laboured. And they are called from their labours, to reſt, from pouertie, to heauenly riches, and from their calamities, to euerlaſting pleaſures. Yea euen when they be dead, then are they bleſſed, and reſt fromApoc. 14. their labours, the ſpirit ſaith ſo, and therefore it is moſt certaineTobias. 2. and true.

               MEn in theſe our dangerous daies, are very cloſe harted, &amp;188 merciles, towards the poore afflicted members of Chriſt. And though they hear their cries, &amp; ſée their poore bodies, readie to die at their doores, in ſtréetes and in priſon, yet vntill

they perceiue, that there is no way, but preſent death with themſelues, they will impart no part of their goodes and wealth vnto them. Such men are like vnto beaſts, which are not eaten, vntill they be dead, and boiled or roſted. For vntill death hath them in his pot, and there boile them after his maner, the poore can haue no releefe at their hands: whiles they liue, they will do no charitable déedes, nor works of mercie: onely at the point of death, in their laſt teſtament, they will perhaps leaue ſome legacies, to be giuen when they be dead: but death muſt be ſure of them, before the poore be ſure of a penny. It were better done by much, to releeue the poore with their owne hands, in their life time: it is not amiſſe that they do good then, but it were better done before. It is to be wiſhed, that man would conſider whence he hath his name, (homo) and finding that he hath it of (humus) the earth, which yéeldeth to euerie man, more than it receiueth at his hands, and bringeth foorth and miniſtreth all maner of fruits, to all men with great aduantage, he would ſurely be afeard, and aſhamed, that the earth ſhould condemne him, in bountifulnes and liberalitie. The Lord doth very earneſtly condemne the couetouſnes, and crueltie of the Iewes, towards the poore, in Ezechiel the prophet, ſaying: They did not ſtretch out their handsEzech. 16. Prouerb. 14. to the poore and néedie. And Salomon ſaith: He ſhall be bleſſed, that hath pitie vpon the poore. And indéede, what a great bleſſing is it, for things of no valure, to receiue great and heauenly riches, for dead things, matters of life, for things tranſitorie, things eternall? and to haue the Lord himſelfe, to be pay maiſter, of all theſe things? And the ſame Salomon ſaith, that heProuerb. 19. laieth in banke vnto the Lord, that hath pitie vpon the poore: and alſo, He that ſtoppeth his eares, at the crie of the poore, ſhall crieIbidem 2

Bleſſed are the mercifull, ſaith Chriſt, for they ſhall receiueMatth. 5. mercie. That man, that vnmercifully kéepeth his gold, monie, meate, cloth, harbour, or other comfort whatſoeuer, and ſéeth his brother or ſiſter want, as he hath no loue of God in him, ſo can he not by Chriſt be ſaued. What then ſhall become of them, which being rich, do not onely, not ſuccour and comfort the poore, but alſo diſmay, diſcomfort, and diſpoile them, of that they haue?

                   are fettered and holden in the ſnares of ſathan, and wo wo is their reward. It is a world to ſée, how the houſes, wals, chambers, bedſtéeds, and garments, of rich men, glitter and floriſh with gold, and infinite poore ſoules, that Chriſt ſuffered his death for, are readie to periſh in euerie place, for want of foode, and neceſſaries. They enrich ſtocks and ſtones, and ſuffer the ſeruants of God to be déepely diſtreſſed. Whiles they hunt after worldly wealth, they let ſlip the kingdome of heauen. O miſerable men, what get they, what haue they, what poſſeſſe they? ſurely nothing of any valure, and yet they loſe themſelues. They haue a vaile before their eies, birde lime in their wings, and fetters about their féete, that they cannot ſée the kingdome of God, they cannot moo

               AS feathers do lift vp, and carrie on high, the foules and189 birdes of the aire: So the riches and dignities of this world, are woont to extol and carrie men, into the aire and clouds of vanitie.
               And as haukes truſting to their wings, will flie excéeding high, as though they woulde pearce the clouds themſelues, for their too high flieng, are oftentimes loſt: So men depending vpon the wings of proſperitie, being puffed vp and ſwelled with pride, the higher they clime, the more miſchéeuous is their fall, and with the greater diſgrace, are they hurled downe headlong. Theſe be thoſe feathers of vanitie, which God commanded to pull out, and to caſt them into the duſt. The remembrance ofLeuit. 1. death, is a place of duſt, where we ought continuallie to reuolue in our minds, thoſe things which the men of this world do déeme and iudge, to be moſt excellent, conſidering how they all, in the twinckling of an eie, do vaniſh away, and are conſumed, and we with them are turned into duſt.
            
            
               TRées growing in the woode, are knowne, ſome by the difference190 of their truncks or bodies, ſome by the propertie of their boughes, branches, leaues, flowers and fruits, but this knowledge is had of them, whiles they ſtande, growe, and are not conſumed: but if they be committed to the fire, and turned

into aſhes▪ they cannot be knowne: for how is it poſſible, that, when the aſhes of diuers kinds of trées, are mingled togither, the tall pine trée, ſhould be diſcerned, from the great and huge oke, or the mightie popler from a little lowe ſhrub, or anie one tree from another? Euen ſo men, whiles they liue in the wood of this world, are knowne, ſome by the ſtocke of auncetors, ſome by the floriſhing leaues of their words and eloquence, ſome in the floures of beautie, and ſome in the fruits of honeſtie, manie by their ſauage barbarouſnes, and ſome by their milde lenitie and kindnes. But when death doth bring them into duſt, and hath mixed and mingled them all togither; who can by their aſhes, earth and duſt, diſcerne and know them? when the aſhes and duſt of all, are mingled togither, what difference is there then, betwéene the mightie princes of the worlde, and the ſéelie poore ſoules, that are no account made of? into the remembrance of ſuch duſt and aſhes, we ought to caſt, the beautifull and faire feathers of this world, leaſt being puffed vp with our owne conceites, and with an ouer well wéening of our ſelues, we vtterlie loſe all temperance, and meaſure kéeping, and plunge our ſelues into intollerable errors. For it is a plaine caſe, that where vaine glory doth dominéere and beare the rule, there is no place for temperance, neither can vertue be ſuffered to be reſident, in the kingdome of vanitie.
            
            
               HAukes of the beſt kind, whiles they liue are highlie eſtéemed,191 and much made of, and are daintily fed, and tenderly looked vnto, and are caried vpon the fiſts of great and mightie men: but when they be dead, they are throwne out vpon the dunghill. And on the other ſide, the partridge when ſhe liueth, is troubled, afflicted, &amp; purſued of al, euery cartar &amp; ploughman, is readie to fall vpon hir, to do hir violence, and to kill hir: But when ſhe is dead, ſhe is brought to the tables of princes, and is very honorably ſet before them: So very many, that in this life, are counted very famous and notable men, and do lead their liues, in great proſperitie and worldly wealth, and haue all things at their wils and pleaſures, when they remooue hence, and go out of this life, they ſhall be hurled vpon that moſt foule and filthie dung hill of hell, to be tormented in the ſtinch and abhomination thereof for euer. But others which in this life are incumbred, tormented, and afflicted with diuers and ſundrie

calamities, and euen for their vertues ſake, are hated of the wicked, and contemned of the world, when they ſhall depart out of this life, they ſhall be brought and preſented before the Lorde, with great honour, and placed with the king of heauen, in euerlaſting glorie, that is full of honor, and full of vnſpeakable ioyes. Theſe men the worlde is weary of, and therefore doth ſcorne,Pſal. 15. deſpiſe and hate them, as men not woorthie to liue: whereas indéed, they ought, to cheriſh and to honor them, bicauſe they feare the Lord. And on the contrary ſide: The world is in loue with men of ſinne, and doth onely honor thoſe, that abound with all maner of iniquitie, and as it hath them in great admiration in their life time, ſo it maketh no end of prayſing &amp; extolling them, when they be dead. Theſe the world adorneth with all the feathers it hath, and yet in a very moment of time, they loſe all: and then one houre taketh from them, all thoſe things, honours, dignities, pleaſures, and delights, which were long a getting, with great care, and no litle coſt, &amp; then themſelues are ſent into endleſſe woes, and euerlaſting paines. Héerehence is that ſayeng of Eccleſiaſticus: The riches of the vniuſt, ſhall be dryedEccleſ. 40. vp like water, and they ſhall make a noiſe like a great thunderclap in time of raine. And man (ſaith the prophet) is like a thingPſal. 144. of nothing, his daies paſſe away like a ſhadow. Indéede man dieth, and all his pompe, vainglory and proſperitie with him. And good were it for the wicked if they might neuer riſe vp againe. For as our old ſayeng is, It were better to lie ſtil, then to riſe vp to take a fall: eſpecially ſuch a fall as theirs ſhall be, to wit, from heauen to hell, from God to the diuell, and from al bliſſe and happines, into the moſt bitter curſe of God, and tortures of damnation.
            
            
               EVen as ſmoke preaſeth and flieth vp on high, as though it192 would couer and darken the ſkie: So enuie and calamitie do aime at thoſe eſpecially, which are aduanced, and placed, in high degrée, ſo that many times, they are caſt downe headlong from their dignitie, very ſuddenly with much ignominie and diſgrace: eſpecially when their honors, haue changed and corrupted their maners. Nabucadnezzar that mightie king, which is compared to an eagle, as though he were péereleſſe among men, as the eagle among birds, yet notwithſtanding, immediately after, his wealth, power, pride, and proſperitie, are

compared by the prophet, to light feathers, that are blowen andEzec. 17. caried away with euery blaſt of winde. Séeing then, that whatſoeuer this worlde doth or can affoord vs, is indre ſubiect to a change, then the Moone, and more vnconſtant then the winde, let vs learne to contemne the world, with all the trifles and traſh of the ſame, and ſéeke for the kingddme of God, and the righteouſnes thereof, for that indureth for euer.
            
            
               EVen as from the ſap of a trée, doth procéede that ſtrength,193 wherewith the boughes do floriſh and bring foorth fruit: So from a godly prince, ſuch iuſtice, vertue, and godlines, do procéede, that thereby all the people are mightily mooued, to true religion, a right worſhipping of God, due obedience, and honeſtie of life and conuerſation.
            
            
               SVbmiſſion and lowlines of minde, is as it were a veſſell,194 wherin vertues are laid vp, and kept as iewels of great valure. And as Bernard ſaith, Humilitie of the hart is a receptacle of grace. And Chryſoſtome his opinion is, that Humilitie is a great ſacrifice. Gregory ſaith, that Humble men, when they ſtoupe loweſt, and proſtrate themſelues before the Lordes throne, then they riſe vp (ſaith he) to the ſimilitude and likenes of God. On the other ſide, proude men whiles they vaunt and exalt themſelues, they imitate the diuell, but ſuch the Lorde is woont to bring lowe, and to exalt the humble and méeke.
            
            
               EVen as in winter, when it is excéeding colde, and in ſommer,195 when too much heate inflameth all things, great thunder and lightenings are ſeldome heard, and ſéene, as Plinie reporteth in his ſecond booke, but in the ſpring time and harueſt, when the aire is cléere and calme, then chéefly they burne and ſtrike where they light: So great calamities, and bitter troubles, do lie in waite for proſperitie: they ſéeke not after them, which in a lowe and meane eſtate, do labour and take paines, in heate and cold, and all ſtorms elſe, but thoſe do they moſt ſuddenly wound, ouerthrowe, and conſume as it were with fire, which in a calme ſpring time, and harueſt of proſperitie, are drunken with pride, and to too inſolent with vaine glorie of the world, and are ſet vpon the top of vanitie it ſelfe. I ſuppoſe that in this life there is nothing ſafer, nothing more profitable, nothing better,

nothing fitter to aduance vertue to a due honor, and to be ſhort, nothing that ſooner bringeth tranquillitie, and other good things, than true humilitie, and a Chriſtian lowlines of mans minde. Iames the apoſtle doth ſay, that God reſiſteth the proud,Iames. 4. and giueth grace vnto the humble. And againe: Be ye humbled in the ſight of the Lord, and he will exalt you. And Peter in his firſt epiſtle canonicall, Be ye humbled, ſaith he, vnder the mighty1. Pet. 5. hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of viſitation. And the Lord in the mouth of Abdias the prophet, ſaith to the proude ones of the world: If thou ſhalt be exalted as an eagle, and ſhalt build thy neſt among the ſtars, I will pull thée downe fromAbdias. 1 Pſal. 37. thence. And the Pſalmiſt ſaith: I ſawe the wicked exalted, and lifted vp like the Cedars of Libanus, and I paſſed by, and behold he was not: I ſought him, and he was not to be found, his place could not be ſéene. Indéede the proud and vainglorious ſort of the world, although they ſéeme to be very happie men, yet they haue moſt miſerable ends, many times, and foule fals, from the height of their honors, dignities, and proſperities, and that which is woorſt of all, they are tumbled downe into hell, with the mightie hand of Gods indignation.
            
            
               EVen as in the midſt of the ſphere, is that centre, from which196 all lines being drawen, do tend towards their circumference: So a good Chriſtian man, hath God for his circumference. For whatſoeuer he thinketh, ſpeaketh or doeth, it tendeth to Chriſt, of whom he is compaſſed round about: for as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, The Lord is round about his people. And againe: His truthPſal. 125. ſhall compaſſe thée round about, thou ſhalt not be afraid for anyPſal. 91. Pſal. 32. terror by night: alſo, Mercy ſhall compaſſe him about, that putteth his truſt in the Lord. Indéed our good ſauiour Chriſt, is that diuine circumference, which compaſſeth round about his ſeruants, and is at euery hand, néere vnto his déere children. He is that ſame celeſtial trée, that couereth and compaſſeth about, with the ſhadow thereof, all thoſe that flie to him for ſuccour: yea all the poore birds of God, ſhall ſafely builde their neſts vnder the ſhadow of his boughes. He that dwelleth (ſaith the prophet) in the helpe of the almightie, ſhall reſt in the protection of the God of heauen. Indéede to be vnder the Lords protection, and in his fauour, is to be in all ſafetie, againſt all power of men and diuels, and to be from vnder the wings of his grace, is to lie open to all

dangers, and to death and deſtruction it ſelfe, of our ſoules and bodies. The Lord therefore kéepe vs ſo néere vnto himſelfe, in due obedience to his will and word, that he may vouchſafe, to be our ſhield and buckler, againſt all the aſſaults of ſathan.
            
            
               EVen as lightenings do ſmite, whatſoeuer they finde in the197 earth, except the lawrell trée, as Plinie affirmeth, in his ſecond booke, chapter 55: So, great calamitie, is able to take away, and to ouerthrow, whatſoeuer is in man, or that he hath, ſaue onely firme and conſtant vertue: for conſtant vertue is a goodly lawrell trée, euer floriſhing and gréene, and will not be conſumed, burnt vp, nor deſtroied, with any fire, that breaketh out of the cloudes, be it neuer ſo fierce, nor with any violence of torments and troubles whatſoeuer. To this vertue doth the apoſtle exhort vs, ſaying: My déere brethren, 
                     •
                  e ye conſtant and1. Cor. 15. vnmooueable, alwaies rich in the worke of the Lord: and indéed, they that are grounded in the loue of Chriſt, and leaue nothing vndone, to auoid the diſhonoring of God, and the offending of their brethren, and do their beſt indeuour, to honor and obey the almightie, and to edifie his ſeruant
                     •
                  , do not onely not feare the firebrands of any ſorrow whatſoeuer, but alſo do euen deſpiſe, all the firie flaſhings and thunderclaps of the world, and do remaine conſtant, and vnchangeable in the ſeruice of God, euen to the loſſe of their liues if néede be. Infidels that knew not Chriſt, but were méere ſtrangers vnto him, thought it better to loſe their liues, than to violate their promiſes and othes made to their enimies: Much more then ought Chriſtians, in ſuch caſes to be conſtant. The Lord himſelfe in the mouth of Ezechiel the prophet, affirmeth, that he ſhall neuer thriue nor proſper, that makethEzech. 17. no conſcience of violating and breaking his oth, wherewith he hath bound himſelfe, though it be to his deadly enimie. And Ioſua hauing promiſed vpon his oth, that the Gabaonites ſhouldIoſua. 9. liue in the countrie vntouched, afterward when their great deceit was diſcouered, and they found moſt vnwoorthie to liue, yet for his oth ſake he ſpared their liues. We haue ſworne vnto them (ſaith he) in the name of the God of Iſrael, and therefore we cannot touch them. We learne by this to beware how we binde our ſelues by othes, but if we haue once done it, we muſt not regard, to whom, but by whom, we haue ſworne and bound our ſelues.
               
                  EVen as the lambes, with the which the ſhéepe were conceiued,198 as they beheld Iacobs rod, were of the ſame colour, thatGeneſ. 30. the rod was of: So, ſuch as the religion, and actions, of princes, péeres of realmes, and countries, miniſters, parents and gouerners be, ſuch for the moſt part, is the religion, and ſuch be the actions of ſubiects, and inferiour perſons. For as examples are very dangerous in euill things, ſo be they of great force and vertue, in good and holy things. When princes will haue, godlie, vertuous, loyall, and obedient ſubiects, they muſt deale with them, as Iacob did with his ſhéepe, they muſt lay before them, the rod of true religion, iuſtice, holines, righteouſnes, and integritie of life and maners, and then no doubt, they will conceiue in their harts, thoughts that be pure, righteous, chaſte, ſound and holy, and bring foorth great plentie of fruits, of the ſame colour that the rod is of: to wit, not words onely, but works alſo of 
                     •
                  aith and obedience to God and man. Parents with their natural children, miniſters of the word, with their ſpiritual children, and maiſters with their ſeruants, muſt do the like.
            
            
               AS moſt pleaſant perfumes, do euen then, when they be in199 the fire, giue out a moſt excellent odor, and their ſwéeteſt ſauour: Euen ſo, a vertuous and godly man, when he is thruſt into the midſt of the hote ſcorching fire of calamitie and miſerie, doth then ſhew moſt his vertue, faith, religion, patience and conſtancie.
            
            
               THere be ſome men, which now and then, do beſtow great200 coſt, and much of their riches, vpon thoſe that néede them not, not drawne therunto with either loue or mercie, but caried with vaine glory &amp; with vanity it ſelfe, ſo to do. Such men are like fluds which ſend their waters into the ſea, and leaue the drie land, which is very thirſty, vnwatred. But ſuch men (by the commandement and will of God) ſhould helpe the poore, féede the hungrie, cloth the naked, harbor the harborleſſe, viſite and redéeme captiues, &amp;c. For that is the mercy, whereto the Lords bleſſing and mercy belongeth, according to that he ſaith: BleſſedMatth. 5. are the mercifull, for they ſhall obtaine mercy. It is a worlde to ſée and conſider, that man dare be ſo bold, and ſo ſhameleſſe, to make but a tuſh, or a thing of nothing, of the Lords commandement, when in the mouth of his prophets, he ſaith: Breake thyEſay. 58.
                  
bread vnto the hungrie: And, Giue thy bread to the hungrieEzech. 10. ſoule, and couer the naked with thy garment, if thou wilt liue and be ſaued. How thinkeſt thou (O man) that God will heare thée, ſéeing thou thinkeſt him, not woorthie the hearing? With what hart, canſt thou beg a kingdome of him, to whom thou denieſt a péece of bread, when he ſendeth thine, and his owne brother for it? doſt thou thinke, that he will beſtow vpon thée, an immortall garment of eternall glorie, ſéeing thou refuſeſt to giue to his poore naked ſeruant, that is readie to periſh, and to die with cold, one of thy ſuperfluous, and old moth eaten garments? The vaine men of the world, which do lauiſh out their riches and ſubſtance, vpon néedleſſe things, and méere vanities, without regarding the néedie ſaints of God, will neuer be able to anſwer their dooings, before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt. Will the Lord of heauen and earth take this in good part, that haukes and dogs, are kept and fed, fat and faire, and his ſéely ſoules that he died for, haue neither coates nor fleſh vpon their backs? or doth this pleaſe him, that wals, and ſtones, be moſt curiouſly and coſtly adorned and couered, and men want to eate, and wherewith to couer their nakednes? How ſwéete a ſacrifice were it to God, and how highly would it pleaſe him, if many rich and coſtly ſuits of apparell, that men and women haue more then they néed, and many golden chaines, care rings and other coſtlie iewels, which ſerue more for pride, then for profit, were willingly &amp; euen in loue to God, tranſlated by the owners of them, into almes for the poore, &amp; into reléefe for poore diſtreſſed men, women &amp; children, ſom in priſon, ſom wandring héere and there, deſtitute of all neceſſaries, fréends and comfort? The laſt day of all daies, I meane the generall iudgement day, will be a very gloumie and blacke ſeſſions day, for thoſe men, which do now kéepe cloſe and faſt lockt vp in their cheſts and cofers, their thouſands and hundreds of golde and ſiluer, and are ſo couetous, that if they could do it, all things that they looke vpon, ſhould be turned into gold, they are ſo inſatiable, and yet ſuffer their poore brethren to liue in great want and miſerie. Oh inſatiable couetouſnes, oh vngodlie gréedines, oh lamentable madnes. If ſuch men ſhoulde ſée but one quarter of an houre, the torments that Diues indureth, &amp; ſhall for euer in hell, they would ſurely be afeard, though they would not repent, and giue ouer their couetous and vnmercifull dealings, with the ſeruants of God. But alas, they are like

to féele them for euer, though heere they cannot ſée them, vnleſſe the Lord giue them true and ſpéedie repentance, which I beſéech him, (if it may ſtand with his glorie) vouchſafe to do.
            
            
               EVen as corne laid vp and kept, in a barne, garner or other201 place, doth not increaſe, yea many times is eaten, and conſumed of weuels, and other vermine, but being caſt into the ground, doth bring foorth plentifull fruite, and great increaſe, &amp; is very profitable for the owner: So riches, as gold, money, &amp; other iewels, laid vp in cheſtes and kept in coffers, are oftentimes in danger of loſing by théeues, that may breake through, and ſteale them, or by fire that may conſume them: but being diſperſed and ſcattered among the poore and néedie ſaints of God, they bring foorth fruit an hundreth folde, and are very profitable both to the giuer and to the receiuer, diſcharging a good conſcience in the one, and comforting the diſtreſſed bodie and minde of the other.
            
            
               AS pits and lakes of ſpring water, being ſtopped and polluted202 with mire, mud, or other foule and filthie matter, if they be ſcoured and drawne out, will flow with water, that is pleaſant, ſwéete, and wholſome, but ſuffered and let alone, are corrupted, and do ſtincke: So, riches and worldly ſubſtance if they be diſtributed vnto the poore, and tranſlated from them that haue too much, to thoſe that are néedie, and haue nothing, they do greatly increaſe, and multiplie: for a very little is great riches to him, that hath nothing, and to him that did beſtowe them, they are inſtruments, and meanes of Gods bleſſing, but being coffered and lying ſtil, ſo that the poore néedy creatures are not reléeued with them, they are verie vnprofitable, and will bréed the ſtinch of hell, and endleſſe wo, to thoſe that ſo do kéepe them. The kingly prophet ſpeaking from God, ſaith: Bleſſed isPſal. 41. the man, that conſidereth the poore and néedie, the Lord will deliuer him in the euill day, or in the day of trouble. He calleth mercie, the direct way to bliſſe, when it is an effect, of a liuelie faith, that man hath in the Lord Ieſu: And he calleth that time, that bringeth with it, bitternes, calamitie, and tribulation, the euill day, or day of trouble, wherein the Lorde doth neuer forſake nor faile his ſeruants, that put their truſt in him, and are mercifull to others. And the ſame prophet ſaith: He hath diſperſedPſal. 112.

Cor. 12. Epheſ. 5. as the apoſtle ſaith. And as it ſhould be againſt nature, that one foote ſhould hinder, or ſmite another: So is it againſt reaſon, that one man doth hurt another, yea, it is verie vnreaſonable, and vngodly, that one chriſtian doth not comfort and reléeue another, in their tribulations and wants.

               TAking of vſurie in ſundry places of the ſcripture, is forbidden,204 vpon paine of Gods eternall diſpleaſure. And thatEzech. 18. Pſal. 15. Deut. 23. &amp; 24. doth helpe vſurers no whit, which is written in Deuteronomie, where Moſes granteth liberty to the people, to take vſurie of ſtrangers. For that is to be vnderſtoode permiſſiuely, bicauſe of the imperfection of the people, and to auoid a greater inconuenience at that time, better knowne to Moſes, then vnderſtoode of vs. As that was of putting away mens wiues: ForMatth. 19. Deut. 24. when the Iewes demaunded of Chriſt, wherefore Moſes commanded to giue a bill of diuorcement &amp; to put away their wiues: Chriſt anſwered, Moſes for the hardnes of your harts, did ſuffer you ſo to do. The ſame may be ſaid of his permitting vſurie in that place. And howſoeuer they, that do borrow, to paie vſury, thinke themſelues pleaſured for a time, at the length they finde and féele that it bréedeth their ſmart and wo. For, euen as a man that is ſtoong with a ſnake, ſéemeth (as ſom writers do report) to be ſtroken with a féeling of ſom pleaſure, and ſo falleth to ſléepe, and reſteth very ſwéetely therin, vntil he muſt now giue his laſt gaſpe, and ſo depart. Bicauſe the poyſon which laid lurcking in him, whiles he ſlept, did run through all the parts and members of him, and ſo poyſoned him to death: So he that taketh money to pay vſury, is delighted with the money ſome ſhort time, but in the end, the vſury turneth him, and all that he hath, into moſt wretched and miſerable debt. So, that whereas he was a frée man before, he is now in bondage, and drowned in other mens

debts. And ſo both the man and goods are poiſoned and conſumed. It is therefore the commandement of Chriſt, that chriſtian menLuc. 6. ſhould lend one to another, without looking or hoping for anie thing more then the principall which they lende. Ambroſe ſaithAmbroſ. in his booke, De bono mortis, in the 14. queſtion of the 4. Chapter, that if any man take vſury, he committeth theft, alluding to the words of Ezechiell in the 18. chapter, and ſaith, That the vſurer ſhall die and not liue. And Chryſoſtome ſaith, that there is nothingChryſoſt. filthier, nothing crueller, then vſurers, and that they do make marchandiſe of other mens miſeries, and their own gain, of other mens loſſes. The vſurer is like to that man, which vnder the colour of loue and friendſhip, will take his neighbour by the hande, and lift him vp, to the ende he may giue him a greater fall.
            
            
               IT is the will and pleaſure of God, that the life of euery chriſtian205 teacher, be correſpondent vnto his doctrine, and that the life and maners of all men, be anſwerable to their profeſſion. Therefore the Lord himſelfe doth ſaie, that whoſoeuer will beEzech. 18. Pſal. 15. ſaued, muſt do the thing that is right. For he that inſtructeth others with wholeſome doctrine, and doth ſo ſtaine, and blemiſh himſelfe, with vile and naughtie v
                     ••
                  es, that his life and doctrine be oppoſite and cleane contrary the one to the other, ſo that it is ſéene and perceiued of all, that there is no agréement betwéene them: he is like vnto a ſieue or a boulter, wherewith meale is ſifted or boulted, which ſendeth foorth the fineſt floure, and beſt of the wheate, and kéepeth the bran and woorſt to it ſelfe. The Lord coupleth togither, in the prieſtes of the old law, Doctrine andExod. 28. Truth: regarding both their teaching and liuing. He is a true and truſtie teacher, which doth himſelfe, that ſame that he teacheth. The diſciples of the Pharyſies could eſpie ſo much, though they loued it not, when they ſaid to Chriſt: We know that thouMatth. 22. art true, and that thou teacheſt the way of God truely. They confeſſe though with a wicked purpoſe, that he did not onelie teach, but alſo liue after the truth. Wherein all chriſtians ought to imitate Chriſt.
            
            
               WHen in mans body, the hart doth not impart vnto the206 members, the vitall ſpirits, but the arteries are ſtopt and ſhut vp, and the blood forſaketh the veines, it is a

ſigne of death: That man is either already dead, or elſe he will die ſhortly: Euen ſo, when kings and princes of the earth, are tyrannicall towards their loyall ſubiects, withdrawing from them pittie, mercy, loue and liberalitie, it threatneth and doth prognoſticate the ruine of their kingdomes. But through the mercy, clemencie and loue of princes, their kingdomes do mightily floriſh, and the princes themſelues, do inioy great tranquillitie, ſecuritie, and peace. God put thankfulnes into the harts of all the true and faithfull ſubiects of England, and elſe where within hir Maieſties dominions, for our moſt gratious &amp; dread ſoueraigne, Quéene Elizabeth, for certainly that ſaieng of Salomon in his Prouerbes, was neuer more truely verified, in anie king or Quéene, ſince the foundation of England, then it hath béene in hir highnes: Mercie and truth do kéepe the king, and with clemency the kings throne is ſtrengthened and eſtabliſhed. So, all the worlde muſt be faine to ſaie: Mercie and truth, doProu. 20. kéepe good Quéene Elizabeth, and clemencie doth ſtrengthen hir throne. Hir highnes doth that ſame, that Artaxerxes ſpeaketh of himſelfe, in the booke of Eſter: When (ſaith he) I did rule and gouerne many nations, and had brought the whole world vnderEſter. 13. my dominion, I would not abuſe the greatnes of my power, but would gouerne my ſubiects with clemencie and lenitie. All the world muſt néedes confeſſe the ſame of hir Maieſtie, towards all hir ſubiects: Hir ſeate hath alwaies béene inuironed and compaſſed about with mercy, which (as Hieronimus ſaith) doth lift man vp to Godward: All the world is not able to lay to hir highnes charge, ſo much as one dram of crueltie, which (as the ſame author affirmeth) doth caſt man downe to hell ward. Euen as among the pretie ſwéete Bées, that Bée onely, which leadeth and ruleth all the reſt, either hath no ſting, or at the leaſt doth not vſe it: So clemencie and mercy agréeth with none more in al the world, then with a prince. God giue grace to all hir Maieſties ſubiects, ſo loyally, louingly, obediently, and faithfullie, to beare and behaue themſelues, that the mighty God of Iſraell, may affoorde vs, hir Maieſties life, happy raigne, &amp; chearefull countenance, many yéeres, Amen. For in the chéerefulnes ofProu. 16. hir countenuance is life.
            
            
               INgratitude is a thing, that the Lord could neuer abide. It is207 a ſcorching winde, that drieth vp the fountaines of piety, and the ſtreames of grace. Whereas euery thing, that is weighty

and heauie, tendeth and preaſeth downward, yet notwithſtanding, the cloudes that are full of water, and ſwelled with moiſture, do aſcend vpward, bicauſe the ſunne taketh them from the earth, and with his force draweth them vp on high. Which being lifted vp in the aire, are gathered togither and thickened, and ſo do couer and hide the brightnes of the ſunne, by whoſe helpe and attraction, they were taken and caried vp: but notwithſtanding their malice, they being diſperſed and ſcattered abroad, the ſun, that conquerer, and ouercommer of darknes, thruſteth through his beams, breaketh the cloudes, and giueth light with his ſhine: Euen ſo the Iſraelites, when they lay in Egypt a long time, in obſcuritie, thraldome, bondage, and ſlauerie, to Pharao and his people, and were euen nailed as it were, to the earth of all contempt and crueltie, were then taken vp, and ſet in great and high dignitie, by the ſunne of righteouſnes, but afterward they went about, to obſcure and extinguiſh the brightnes and light of God himſelf, by whoſe benefit, they had gotten that honor and dignitie, which they had, a
                     •
                  d without whom they were nothing but bond ſlaues of miſerie and wretchednes: but ſéeing they were like foule blacke cloudes, they were diſperſed, ſcattered, and vaniſhed away: And the glorie of Chriſt, againſt their wils, &amp; in ſpite of them, togither with the brightnes of his name, did break out, and ſhine abroad, and giue light throughout all the world. I would to God, that this ingratitude and vnthankfulnes, had neuer a corner in England, nor in any Engliſh hart: it hath pleaſed the almightie, by his faithfull ſeruant, Elizabeth, by his owne grace, Quéene of England, to deliuer our countrie from no leſſe bondage, thraldome and ſeruitude, than he did the Iſraelites by Moſes and Aaron: and yet we finde to too manie, that haue béen bred in England, and owe their liues to hir highnes, to murmure no leſſe againſt hir happines, than the Iſraelites did againſt the lords ſeruants Moſes and Aaron. The ſeruitude and ſlauerie of the Iſraelites, was not greater, nor woorſe vnder Pharao that tyrant in Egypt, than the bondage of England was vnder the Pope, neither ought we to be leſſe thankfull, for our deliuerie from the ſlauerie of Rome, than they ſhould haue béen, if they had well remembred themſelues, from the ſlauerie of Egypt. We read in the booke of Wiſdome, that the hope of theSapien. 16. vnthankfull man, ſhall waſte and conſume like winters ice, &amp;c. And t

               EVen as a moth or worme, doth not bréede in the Cedar, being208 a goodly and odoriferous trée, alwaies freſh and floriſhing, the wood whereof doth not rot: So, enuie is not bred in the hart of a wiſe and vertuous man, but in the minde of a man, that is wicked and vngodly, and is gréeued and tormented, at the happines and welfare of other men, and repining, is ſadder than they that went downe into Trophonius his den, and in enuie paſſeth Zoilus, enuying thoſe eſpecially, that in any gift or qualitie, are before him. Iuſt men, and they that be wel garded with vertues on euery ſide, and are of a noble and excellent courage, can ouercome and ſubdue their enimies, but their enuy they can neuer ouercome, for it will not be tamed nor ſubdued. It is a fire, that conſumeth the harts of them, whom it poſſeſſeth, with a continuall burning. Salomon his counſell is, that thou eate not with an enuious man, nor deſire his meate. And the Apoſtle willethProuerb. 23. Galat. 5. the Galathians, that they be not deſirous of vaine glorie, prouoking one another, and enuying one another. Hieronymus in an epiſtle to Demetriades ſaith: What pleaſure (I pray thée) doth enuie to that man, whom fretting and wrath doth teare, and rend in péeces, in the ſecret corners of his conſcience, and maketh the felicitie of other men, his owne torment? A wicked man taketh pleaſure in his owne wickednes, but the enuious man, is tortured with the good of others. Quintus Curtius in his eight booke, De gestis Alexandri, reporteth, that Alexander was woont to ſay, that enuious men are nothing elſe, but torments and tormentors of their owne ſelues. Chryſoſtom calleth enuie an vnquenchable fire. And Iſidore ſaith, that it doth deuoure all good things in man, with a moſt peſtilent burning heate. And in my opinion, it is a very image of hell, that tormenteth without profite or pleaſure.

Héerehence is that which the Apoſtle ſaith to the Hebrewes: Whom theHeb. 12. Lord loueth, him he doth chaſten, and he ſcourgeth euerie ſonne, whom he receiueth. And in the Reuelation, the Lord in the perſon of Iohn, ſaith: Whom I loue, thoſe do I reprooue and chaſten.Apoc. 3. And in the mouth of Matthew he ſaith: Bleſſed are theyMatth. 5. which ſuffer perſecution, for righteouſnes ſake. True it is, that patience is an heauenly gift, and a very bleſſed thing, for as the Apoſtle ſaith, it worketh a triall in man, and that triall workethRom. 5. an hope, and that hope doth neuer confound, nor ſhame him that hath it. And the ſame Apoſtle willeth the Coloſſians, as the electColoſ. 3. of God, to put on patience: as if he ſhould ſay, there is no veſture nor vertue whatſoeuer, doth better beſéeme the ſeruants of God, than patience vnder croſſes, and in the midſt of a thouſand afflictions. And therefore the holy Ghoſt doth aduertiſe vs, to run with patience vnto the battell or fight, that is ſet before vs, andHeb. 12. euer to looke vpon the author and finiſher of our faith, euen Ieſus, who hauing vnſpeakable ioy ſet before him, did vndergo and indure the croſſe, not regarding, but euen deſpiſing the confuſion and ſhame thereof. It behooueth vs, when we are beſet on euerie ſide, with afflictions and troubles, to flie vnto God, and to beſéech him, that with his aide and helpe, as with the cléere ſhine, of his moſt bright ſunne, he will ſcatter abroad, the cloudes and darknes, of our calamities and great miſeries, leaſt that, if they increaſe and multiplie, we fall into deſpaire, and ſo ſlumber in ſin, and ſléepe in death, that the enimie of our ſoules and ſaluation may ſay, I haue preuailed againſt them. For if we will imbracePſal. 13. the Lord, with all our harts, we ſhall no doubt be, in moſt ſure and certaine ſafegarde. And although the wicked and vngodly ſort, which are more barbarous and ſauage, than brute beaſts, ſhall afflict the ſaints and ſeruants of God, and beare and behaue

themſelues inſolently, and ſhall abuſe their power and authoritie, to the hurt and harme, of ſuch as feare the Lord in ſinglenes of hart, and are readie with all patience, to beare whatſoeuer croſſe ſhall be laid vpon them: yet at the length, the Lords elect ſhall preuaile, one way or other, to their great comfort, and ſhall be aduanced to eternall life, and glorie that neuer ſhall haue end. For as the prophet ſaith: The patient abiding of the poore,Pſal. 10. ſhall not alwaies be forgotten: for although for a time, God ſuffereth his ſeruants, to be ſtrangely afflicted, that vertue in them, may growe to ſome perfection, yet not the leſſe, in his due time, he doth deliuer them, out of all the tempeſts, and ſtormes of the world, and doth make them partakers of his kingdome in glorie euerlaſting. We are woont to call thoſe men martyrs, which ſuffer death by fire or ſword, for Chriſts ſake, and indeede ſo they be: but that man alſo, in my opinion, may rightly be called a martyr, which kéepeth truly in his hart and minde, an vnfained patience, without grudging or repining at any troubles whatſoeuer, thinking himſelfe happie, that he is thought woorthie, to beare ſome croſſe or other, after his Lord and ſauiour Chriſt: ſuch a man, no doubt, is a martyr euen liuing, though he loſe not his life, by fire nor ſword.
            
            
               EVen as thoſe ſhéepe, which in the preſence of their ſhepheards,210 do vomit, and caſt out againe, the graſſe which they haue eaten, do not profitably ſhew, how much &amp; how well they haue fed: but thoſe rather, which do inwardly digeſt and concoct their meate, and do giue abundance of mylke, and do beare the ſoftieſt, weightieſt, and fineſt wooll, and do ſhew themſelues to be fat, faire, and well liking: For by thoſe things they ſhew &amp; plainly prooue, that their paſture is excéeding good: Euen ſo, not thoſe paſtors, miniſters, and preachers of the word, which do deliuer words, and ſtuffe their ſermons with eloquence and braue phraſes, do fruitfully and throughly declare vnto the people, that vertues paſture is excellent, good, and wholſome, and to be deſired of all, but they rather, which do inwardly concoct vertue, and do obſerue it, and bending themſelues to the actions and performance therof, do flow, with the ſwéet milke of mercy, and do cloth themſelues &amp; others with the fine fléeces of chriſtian loue and charitie, ſuch I ſay, do euidently declare, how much they haue profited in the doctrine of Chriſt, and how much alſo

others ought to profite in the ſame, and do ſtir vp the harts and minds of their hearers, to vertue and godlines, both with their doctrine and liuing. Words of doctrine are very profitable, but when they are ſéene to worke, holines and righteouſnes in the teacher, they then preuaile the better with them that are taught. Paule therefore exhorteth Timothy, to ioyne with his preaching, the work of an Euangeliſt: And alſo willeth Titus, to ſhew himſelfe2. Timoth. 4. Titus 2. an example of good works. Our ſauiour himſelfe ſaith: He that ſhall do theſe things, and teach men ſo, he ſhall be called great in the kingdome of heauen.
            
            
               AS the lighter ballance, or ende of the beame, will preaſe211 vpward, and euer be higheſt: So, the vayner, more vnprofitable and vniuſter, that a man is, the more will hée vaunt, and extoll himſelfe: And being a very impious, vngodly, and moſt wicked man, will arrogantly aſſume vnto himſelfe righteouſnes, and moſt impudently chalenge the name of a good and honeſt man, when indéed he ſetteth more by one penie of money, then by ten pounds woorth of honeſtie, and doth loue more ten pounds of money, then he doth the health, wealth, credite, liberty, life, yea and more then the ſoule of his neighbour, and chriſtian brother. But on the other ſide, euen as the fuller and heauier ſcale, is euer loweſt: So the more vertuous, honeſt, and godly, that any man is, the more will he ſubmit and humble himſelfe, and howſoeuer other men, will ſéeme to praiſe him, he neuertheleſſe doth ſtil acknowledge his owne imperfection. And indéed it is in a chriſtian man, ſome perfection, to know, and to acknowledge his want and imperfection. For when he humbleth himſelfe moſt, then doth God eſpecially exalt him. And when he throweth downe himſelf, as vnwoorthy to be numbred amōg the ſeruants &amp; ſaints of God, then doth the Lord ſet down and regiſter his name in the booke of life, ſo that it ſhall neuer be raſed, nor blotted out, but ſhall ſtand and remaine there for euer, according to that which the holie prophet ſaith: The iuſt manPſal. 112. ſhall be in an euerlaſting remembrance, for the Lord is euer exalting the humble and méeke, and bringing downe the proude and inſolent.

Such men when they ſéeme beſt, are then woorſt: For of all improbitie, there is none more pernicious, then that of theirs, which when they are moſt bent to deceiue, they handle the matter ſo, that they may ſéeme to be honeſt, vertuous and godly men. As for example: If thou méeteſt with a théefe, and talkeſt with him of honeſty, he will ſaie as thou ſaieſt, but ſhortly after, he will rob thée, binde thée hand and foote, and perhaps kill thée. And if neceſſitie conſtraine thée, to borrow money of the couetous cormorant, and miſerable vſurer, thou ſhalt heare come out of his mouth, words as ſmooth as oyle, wherewith he will ſo inſinuate himſelfe, and créepe into thy ſecrets, that thou wouldeſt thinke him to be a very ſaint, &amp; a man of God: But when he hath ſounded thée to the depth, and perceiueth that thou haſt an houſe, a leaſe, good furniture, ſome land, plate, or other cōmoditie, then he wil tel thée, that he would faine do thée good, and helpe thée, but the world is dangerous, and that a birde in his hand is better then two in the wood, and his money is his plough, and that he muſt liue vpon it, as the huſbandman liueth vpon his plough. And by theſe meanes will he draw from thée an offer, of thy houſe, leaſe, lande, plate, horſe, cowe, or the bed thou lieſt vpon: And on any of theſe things, he will lende thée, about the fourth or fift part of their valure. But there was neuer théefe, nor traitour, more ſurely bounde, to be executed, and to loſe his life, then he will make ſure worke, and binde thée to thy owne conſumption and vtter vndooing, in body, goods, and name. Indéed his money is his plough, and the vſurer himſelfe, is the horſe that doth drawe it, and tyrannicall couetouſnes doth holde it, and the diuell himſelfe doth driue it, and thou poore borrower art the land they plow vpon, &amp; amongſt them, they make long and déepe furrowes, of extréeme pouertie, and miſerie to thée, and of their owne euerlaſting deſtruction. For the driuer will neuer giue ouer, till he driue the plough, horſe, and holder, all into hell. And yet ſome body will ſay, that the vſurer is an honeſt man, and doth helpe many. His honeſtie is like a very bitter and pinching blacke froſt, to tender, ſwéete, pleaſant and beautifull bloſſomes: The froſt doth kill and deſtroy the bloſſomes, and the vſurer doth kill men, women, and children. And the helpe, that the poore borrower, hath at his hand: is like that ſuccour, that a poore ſhéepe hath vnder a thorne

buſh, in ſome ſtorme or tempeſt: the ſéelie ſhéepe is ſheltred there, and kept from the ſmart of the tempeſt a little while, but when ſhe departeth from the buſh, it kéepeth backe a péece of hir fleece, and the oftner ſhe goeth, the barer and nakeder ſhe is: So that at the length, ſhe is able neither to abide buſh nor ſtorme. Such a bu
                     •
                  h of thornes is the vſurer, to the poore borrower, he will leaue him at the length, no fléece on his backe: he will leaue him no houſe ouer his head, vnleſſe it be ſome priſon houſe to die in, no bed to reſt vpon, no fleſh on his bones, no credite in the worlde. I cannot finde in my hart to eate and drinke with an vſurer at his owne table, if I know him, bicauſe his meate and drinke ſéemeth to me, to be the very fleſh and blood, of poore honeſt men, their wiues, and children. Yet this thing I note in that buſh, that pincheth, and pilleth the poore ſhéepe, that it neuer thriueth nor prooueth good timber, but ſerueth onely for the fire: So the vſurer ſerueth for nothing but hell, and howſoeuer hée thriueth héere, he ſhall be ſurely pinched there. It were well (in my opinion) if vſurers were cenſured now in our daies, as they were in times paſt: in thoſe daies they were neuer called to any office, in the church, nor common wealth: For what right, iuſtice, or equitie, could be looked for at their hands, which were moſt vnnaturall, and cruell oppreſſors of their brethren? The poore would take no reléefe at their hands, bicauſe they knewe the curſe of God, did follow them, and that they had: neither durſt they eate the fleſh, and drinke the blood of their poore brethren, whoſe marrow the vſurer had pickt out of their bones. Againe, they were neuer admitted to receiue the ſacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt Ieſus, for what ſociety or fellowſhip could be betwéene light &amp; darknes, Chriſt and Beliall, God, and the diuell? And when they were dead, they were not buried like chriſtian men, but throwen out like dead dogs, and rotten carrions, and if they did couer them, it was in diches and filthy places, leaſt the ſtinch of them, ſhuld infect and poiſon the aire, and they ſhould kill men euen being dead, as they vſed to do when they liued, if they were cenſured now a daies, as they were then, we ſhould haue fewer vſurers, and m

                   rich men. And yet theſe men are called of ſome, the golden ones of the worlde. Indéede they haue golden purſes, but braſen faces, they haue ſoft words, but bloodie minds, and harts harder then the adamant. Theſe are the caterpillers, not of Egypt, but of England, that diſcomfort not

                  Pharao, that tyrant and enimie of God, but the Lords ſeruants and déere children. Theſe flie not abroad, at the commandement of God, to plague his enimies, but at the pleaſure of the diuell, to annoy Gods friends. Theſe are not contented to eate vp and to deſtroy corne, graſſe, bloſſomes, leaues, and all fruit beſides, neither will the fleſh of beaſts, and foules, and birds of all ſorts, ſerue them to eate, but they muſt and wil eat, mans fleſh whiles he is aliue. For, to conſume a man in goodes and credit, with vſurie, what is it elſe, but to eate his fleſh, and to drinke his blood? and with ſorrow to pricke and wound his hart, what is it but to kill him? Of all the murtherers in this world (except thoſe, which with falſe, hereticall, and diuelliſh doctrine, do murther ſoules) there is none more cruell, mercileſſe, nor more bloodie, than the vſurer. For he is not ſatiſfied, with the blood of men and women, but he will haue the blood of yoong children, and infants alſo. For he that cutteth downe a trée by the rootes, doth he not withall cut downe, the boughes, twigs, and branches? and he that conſumeth, vtterly vndooeth, and with ſorrow drieth vp the marow in the bones of parents, to the ſhortening of their daies, doth he not euen deſtroy their poore ſwéete infants alſo? Praiſe and commend them, who will, they are barred, and ſhut out ofPſal.

The caterpillers of Egypt, were ſurely tethered, and harmed no place where themſelues were not: but theſe caterpillers, wil ſit at home in their chaires, like a boare that is a franking in his ſtie, and will conſume a man, one, two, or thrée hundred miles from them. Theſe caterpillers by their brokers, do flie ouer, and view, all the lands, lordſhips, mannors, parks, woods, groues, fields, medowes, paſtures, and whatſoeuer, farmes, leaſes, or other commodities, of the noble men, lords, knights, eſquiers, gentlemen, yeomen, and huſbandmen of England, and héere they gobble vp a whole towne, and there a goodly parke: héere a lordſhip or mannor, and there a moſt pleaſant wood. The Lord kéepe all men out of their hands, for where they light and pitch their tents, they waſte, conſume, and make hauocke of all: and do call the places after their owne names, as though they had neuer belonged to the ancient and right owners of them. The God of mercie take from them, couetouſnes of the vaine and tranſitorie things of this world, and worke in them (if it be his will) a coueting and moſt earneſt deſire,

of the ſaluation of their owne ſoules, and an vnfained loue to their brethren in Chriſt Ieſu.

               EVen as that man, which with a painted oxe, doth fowle for213 partridges, is not an oxe, but vnder the ſhape and likenes, of that ſimple creature, lieth in waite for the pretie fine birds, that he may take them, and kill them: So, he that with a counterfeited, and fained holines, will colour and couer impietie, wicked purpoſes, or whatſoeuer is againſt the word, and will of God, is not a iuſt man, but vnder the colour and ſhape of godlines &amp; honeſtie, ſeeking the praiſe and glorie of the world, he caſteth in his head, and worketh by degrées, the ruine, decay, and vndoing of his neighbors, that he may compaſſe their goods, lands and poſſeſſions, and gaine ſome honour, and dignitie among men. Such men haue a ſhew of godlines (as the apoſtle ſaith) but they denie2. Tim. 3. the power therof. And although ſom hypocrites will now &amp; then, ſéeme to forſake their riches, and lend ſome to their neighbours, and beſtowe ſome vpon the poore, yet ſtill the marke they leuell and ſhoote at, is to augment and to increaſe them more &amp; more. For euen as the ſwifteſt of all haukes, going about to ſeaſe vpon and to take, the bird that flieth as it were in the top of the aire, doth not by and by, when ſhe firſt ſéeth hir, flie directly towards hir, but rather at the firſt, with fetching of a compas, doth ſéeme to forſake and to deſpiſe hir, and to drawe and to flie from hir: but at the ſecond or thirde flight, ſhe goeth towards hir, with a woonderful 
                     •
                  orce and incredible ſwiftnes,, to take hir in the aire, and to rend hir in péeces: Right ſo do hypocrites he haue themſelues: for at the firſt, to ſée to, they will ſéeme to thée, not to regarde, but to contemne the riches, and promotions of the world, but then they coine and counterfeit a ſimplicitie, fouling for a greater matter than yet they ſee preſent, and reaching at ſome higher aduauncement, and greater dignitie, than that preſent time and occaſion doth offer: but at the ſecond or third flight, when euery thing doth anſwer their expectation, thou ſhalt perceiue that with all ſpéede and gréedines, they will lay hold vpon thoſe things, which thou thoughteſt they had contemned. They do not wiſh or deſire any thing more, neither can any thing more highly pleaſe them, than the very ſelfeſame things, which they once made the world beléeue, they deteſted, and could not abide them. Theſe are double harted men, they haue wicked lips, and

hands that worke iniquitie, they be thoſe ſinners that go twoEccleſ. 2. maner of waies, and euerlaſting woe is their reward.
               The hypocrite goeth two maner of waies, when he laieth one thing vp cloſe in his hart, and ſheweth another in his actions, ſpeaketh one thing, and doth another. Touching ſuch men and matter, it is commanded in Deuteronomie, that a man ſhould not weare a garment, made of wooll and flaxe, commonlyDeuter. 22. called linſie wolſie, as if it ſhould be ſaid, that kinde of veſture, doth couer the ſubtletie of malice and miſchéefe, ſignified by the flaxe, and doth outwardly ſhew, the ſimplicitie of honeſtie and innocencie, ſignified by the wooll. Such an hypocrite was Herod, when he pretended a great deuotion towards Chriſt, and thatMatth. 2. he would worſhip him, and all the while was whetting his ſword, intending his death, if he could catch him. Such were the inhabitants of Ieruſalem in the time of Sedechias, they boaſted greatly of the law, but they would in no wiſe obſerue it. True vertue among Chriſtians, is that a man leade a life, equall and like vnto his words, and as the apoſtle Iames ſaith, ſo to ſay, and ſo to do. All hypocrites, whatſoeuer they would ſeeme, do ſo far differ from true chriſtianitie, as the froth or fome of golde doth differ from gold it ſelfe.
            
            
               EVen as an archer doth ſhoote néerer, and ſooner hit a faire214 great marke, than a little one: So the diuell doth eaſily hit with his arrowes▪ and ſtrike with his darts, the vaine glorious, and proud men of the world, but the humble and lowly he miſſeth, with all the ſleights and cunning he hath. Euerie proud man, that ſeeketh after vaine glorie, is but vnwiſe and fooliſh, for the diuell hath puffed him vp, and made him a great marke, whereat himſelfe may ſhoote, and the which he may the more eaſily hit, and ſtrike with his poiſoned darts of death. Such a man doth Salomon meane, when he ſaith: The foole doth notProuerb. 7. know, that he hailed to bands, vntill he be wounded vnto death. True praiſe doth conſiſt in vertue, which hath déepe rootes, and ſpreadeth far abroad: all vaine things do quickly fall away, neither can any vaine thing be perpetual. The Ammonites andEzech. 25. Moabites were highly praiſed and extolled, in the mouthes of all men, but they fell ſo far from that praiſe, that the remembrance of them was cleane put out. I ſawe the vngodly man (ſaith the prophet) exalted and lifted vp like the Cedars of Libanus, and IPſal. 3

paſſed by, and lo he was gone, I ſought him, and his place was no where to be found. And Salomon ſaith: The name of the vngodlyProuerb. 10. ſhall conſume and waſte away. Wicked men, which do féede and franke themſelues, with miſchéefe and malice, although for a time, they ſéeme to proſper greatly, and to be highly eſteemed among men, yet notwithſtanding their floriſhing eſtate doth not continue long. The day we ſée doth often come, that they which this day do praiſe, to morrow will either diſpraiſe, or ſay nothing, but eſpecially this we knowe, by daily experience, that they which through hypocriſie, without any vertue or iuſt deſert, haue ſtolen their praiſe and commendations, by deceiuing of mens harts, they either loſe the ſame in this life, before they die, or euen preſently after, when they are caſt headlong into all maner of miſeries. Chriſtians therefore muſt not truſt, to the falſe and deceitfull glorie of the world, bicauſe as Eſaias ſaith: All fleſh is graſſe, and all the glorie of it, is as the flower of the field.Eſay. 40. Eccleſ. 14. And Eccleſiaſticus ſaith, All fleſh doth wither away like graſſe. The prophet Dauid being diſpoſed, to ſpeake of a wicked and vngodly man, that is mightie and famous in the world, he ſaith: When he dieth, he taketh not all, neither doth his glorie orPſal. 49. pompe go with him. When he ſaith, he taketh not all, it is an Hebrew phraſe, and is all one, as if he ſhould ſay, he taketh nothing with him. And therefore ſaith the Lord by Eſay, the glorie of Moab: and the glorie of the Cedar ſhall be taken away. AndEſay. 16. Eſay. 21. 
                  Oſeas the prophet ſaith, that the glorie of the wicked Iewes ſhal be turned into ignominie. It doth therefore behooue all Chriſtians, to ſéeke the glorie of God, and as the Apoſtle doth admoniſh vs, to do all things to the glorie and praiſe of him, that when we1. Cor. 10. ſhall go hence, we may haue eternall glorie with God, through Chriſt Ieſu our Lord and ſauiour. For the glorie of this world is very tranſitorie and vncertaine, it is buried with mens bodies when they be dead, and poſterities do forget it, and blot it out of all remembrance. The counſell of Chryſoſtom is excéeding good: deſpiſing the glorie of the world, ſaith he, thou ſhalt he more glorious, than they that ſéeke it.
            
            
               CHriſtian men do profit more, for the good of their ſoules,215 and towards eternall life, in the narrow and hot burning fornace, of aduerſitie and troubles, than in the large and broad fields, of wealth and proſperitie. For as golde, by fire is ſeuered,

and parted from droſſe: So ſinglenes of hart, and true Chriſtian ſimplicitie, is beſt ſéene, and made moſt euident, in troubles and afflictions: in proſperitie euery man will ſéeme godly, but afflictions do drawe out of the hart, whatſoeuer is there, whether it be good or bad. This made Dauid ſay, ProouePſal 26. me, O Lord, and trie me, ſearch my reines and my hart. It is not amiſſe to vnderſtand by the reines, the inward delights and pleaſures, bicauſe the ſeate of luſts and deſires is ſaid to be in the reines: and by the hart, the ſecret cogitations, bicauſe it is the ſhop and receptacle of the thoughts.
            
            
               EVen as filthy matter or rottennes of a boyle, blaine, or puſh,216 being hid within the fleſh, doth greatly gréeue, and vexe ſore,Weeping, ſobbing, and ſighing, do eaſe the minde. the bodie that is ſicke: But if it breake and run out, the paine is mitigated: So ſorrow being cloſed and ſhut vp, in the hart of man, doth mightily torment him, but being thruſt out, with teares and grones, the hart is ſomewhat eaſed, and the minde a little pacified. They therfore muſt néeds be out of meaſure gréeued, from whom all teares, ſighings, &amp; ſobs are taken. Ezechiel
                  Ezech. 24. the prophet, his wife, whom he loued moſt déerely, died, whoſe death no doubt was gréeuous and bitter vnto him, but that he might not wéepe, nor bewaile hir death, with teares and mourning, did excéedingly augment and increaſe his ſorrowe. TheThe fountain of ſorrow is in the hart. fountaine of ſorrow is in the hart of man, whoſe waters, if they flow not ouer through the eies, they will ouerwhelme &amp; drowne the hart it ſelfe, and will not once ſuffer the thought to turne from languiſh and intollerable gréefe.
               For as a great and thicke ſmoke, vaporing out of a foule217 blacke fyre, vnleſſe it haue frée paſſage, and ſome vente or waie where through it may go out, will all to darken, beſtinch, and make blacke the houſe: Euen ſo, ſorrowe and gréefe procéeding out of the hot fire of calamities, being ſhut vp in the houſe of mans hart, doth make it excéeding blacke, and doth corrupt it, with blacke and bitter choler, vnleſſe through the mouth or eies, there be a breathing out of ſighes, ſet from the bottome of the hart, and ſtreames of teares trickling downe the chéekes. Yet an effeminate and deſperate wailing, either for the dead, or for any other cauſe, as of men without hope, is vtterly to be miſliked: and that Stoicall opinion alſo, that a wiſe man ſhould neuer be mooued, neither with mercy, ſorrow, nor anger,

is to be auoided. For the motions and ſtirs of mans mind, muſt be tempered with reaſon, good counſell, wiſedome, and diſcretion, and are not to be vtterly pulled vp by the rootes. Eccleſiaſticus thinketh it good, that a man moderately bewaile the death ofEccleſ. 22. &amp; 38. others. And when our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, behelde Marie Magdalene, and others alſo wéeping with hir, when hir brotherIohn 11. 35. 
                  Lazarus was dead, he wept, inſomuch that the Iewes meruayled, and ſaid, behold how he loued him.
            
            
               AS a ſmoke, which at the firſt is great and thicke, aſcending218 vpward, is quickly ſcattered and out of ſight: Euen ſo, the glory of the proud men of this world, by little and little is obſcured, and vaniſheth cleane away. The damned ones, which are tormented in hell with endleſſe and euerlaſting paines, do know and acknowledge ſo much: For in the booke of Wiſdome, they are produced ſpeaking theſe words: What good hath ourWiſd. 5. 8. pride done vs? And what profite hath the pompe of our riches brought vs? All theſe things are gone away like a ſhadow, and as a poſte that haſteth by. Let vs therefore, ſet our harts and mindes, and bend we our whole deſires, to heauenly things: And let vs make no account, of earthly, tranſitorie, fraile, and the deceitfull things, of this old, withered, and ruinous world. For if we will déepely conſider, and carefully thinke of that happines, which is laid vp in ſtore in heauen, with God the father, through Ieſus Chriſt, for all them that do beléeue, liue, and die in Chriſt, we will not giue our ſelues, to the ſpéeches of rude, ignorant, and vngodly people, neither will we hunt or hauke after the vaine reports, and idle praiſes and commendations of men, nor yet put any truſt, in any thing that man can do: But we will aſpire and draw néere vnto that God of ours, which is for euer, whom no proceſſe, nor continuance of time, waſteth nor conſumeth: Of whom the prophet ſpeaketh plainly: Thou O Lord ſhalt indurePſal. 102. verſ. 26. 27. for euer, all other things ſhall waxe old as doth a garment, and as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed: But thou art the ſame, and thy yéeres ſhall not faile. And the Lorde himſelfe ſaith to Moſes: I am, that I am. And he ſaide, Thus ſhalt thou ſay to the children of Iſraell, I am, hath ſent meExod, 3. 14. vnto you. As if he ſhould ſay: He that euer hath béene, is, and euer ſhall be, whoſe eternitie is not comprehended, within any limites or bounds, hath ſent me vnto you. If then worldy things

do much mooue vs, which are of no ſuch ſtrength, but that in proceſſe of time, they are weakned, and cleane conſumed, if (I ſaie) that which is of no ſtabilitie in this life, but is ſodainly broken, and periſheth, or at the leaſt, by little and little decaieth, &amp; groweth out of remembrance, and is quite forgotten, is woont to ſtir vs vp, to take great paines, and to vndergo almoſt intollerable toyles, through manifold perils and dangers: Why then, not much rather, yea and a great deale more, are we not ſtirred vp, and mooued by him, that is for euer, to vndergo, and to indure, the like, or (if néede be) greater paines by many degrées, whoſe promiſe and maner it is, to giue to all thoſe, that in truth, and ſinglenes of hart, do loue him, immortall rewards, and to beſtow and place them in euerlaſting bliſſe, in his owne kingdome, with his owne and onely moſt déere ſonne, euen ChriſtMatth. 25. 34 Ieſu, our onely ſufficient, and alone Sauiour and redéemer? God giue vs grace, and the aſſiſtance of his holie ſpirit, that we may withdrawe our harts, mindes, and affections from all thoſe vaine and tranſitorie things, which are ſubiect to ruin, rottennes, and conſumption, and that we may ſet them ſurely vpon our God, follow him, and obey him, according to his owne will, in his written word.

               AS the excellent and noble hauke, called a faulken, vpon219 the fiſt of the fouler, ſéeing a pray flieng on high, doth by and by ſpread hir wings, and offer to breake the ſtrings, wherewith ſhe is holden, and to be gone after the praie; but if ſhe be hooded, ſhe neither ſéeth the pray, nor is any whit mooued: Euen ſo man, whoſe nature far excelleth, all other liuing creatures, thinking vpon the things that are aboue, in heauen with God, and with the eies of his minde, beholding eternall bliſſe, and endleſſe felicitie, he is inflamed and pricked with a great and woonderfull deſire, to attaine, vnto the ſame: but if he be hooded with ignorance, ſpirituall blindnes, and a loue of this worlde, he will neuer be touched with any heauenly motion, nor any whit mooued with any right loue to God, nor once turne, ſo much as one eie of his minde, towards heauen nor God. That moſt noble faulken, I meane the moſt famous and kingly prophet Dauid, being rapt, and as it were rauiſhed, with an vnſpeakable loue,Pſam. 42. v. 1. 2. and deſire to heauen and God, did ſing this ſong: Euen as the Hart, deſireth the water brookes, ſo doth my ſoule long after thée

O God: My ſoule is a thirſt for God, yea euen for the liuing God: When ſhall I come to appéere before the preſence of God? And the holy apoſtle, being very deſirous to flie out of the bands of the body, and to ſhake them off, ſaid thus: Chriſt is to me life,Philip. 1. 21. and death is to me aduantage. And immediately after he ſaith, that he hath a great deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt. And ſuch ought the deſire, of all good Chriſtians to be. God grant it may be ſuch.

               AS they which haue great néede of water, do make haſte, to220 come to the fountaine or well, where water is to be had, but hauing drawne the water, and filled their veſſels, do depart, and turne their backs to the fountaine, which hath ſupplied their want, &amp; ſatiſfied their deſires: So very many, when they be compaſſed round, with perils and dangers, and are beſet on euery ſide with afflictions, and troubles, then they flie apace, to the fountaine of grace &amp; mercy, but when they haue obteined the water of comfort, then they do deſpiſe, that flowing ſpring of liuing water, which complaineth of their vnkindnes, by the prophet Ieremie, ſaieng: They haue forſaken me, the fountaine ofIerem. 2. 13. the water of life. There be to too many, of all ſorts and degrées in the world, which, when they are in the ſtraightes, of calamities and miſerie, will with all poſſible ſpéede, flie and run vnto God, and will power out before him, many deuout and feruent praiers, vpon their bare knées, with teares trickling, and ſtreaming downe their chéekes, and will vſe the name of Chriſt, in hope for his ſake, to be the ſooner reléeued, bicauſe (as the holy Ghoſt ſaith) He is the propitiatiō and attonement for our ſins, by faithRom. 3. 25. 1.

And when they ſhould be moſt mindfull of gods benefits beſtowed vpon them, then do they vtterly forget him. But it is the part, and dutie of euery good chriſtian, if he once dedicate and betake himſelfe to the ſeruice of God, to procéed, and to go forward, from vertue to vertue, and from grace to grace,

and not to turne, the Lords precepts and commandements, behind him, when indéed he ought, to be moſt thankfull, for his louing kindnes, and fauor, which he hath found and receiued. So much doth the Lorde ſignifie by the prophet Ezechiell, where itEzech. 46. 9. is commanded, that they ſhould not go out of the temple, by the ſame gate, that they went in, bicauſe they ſhould not vncomelie, turne the holie things that were there behinde them, and ſo the ſooner forget them, or deal vnreuerently with them. And that alſo in Geneſis doth teach vs no leſſe, where they that went out ofGen. 19. 22. Sodom, were charged that they ſhould make haſte and go foreward, without looking backe, and there is an heauie iudgement of gods vengeance, ſhewed vpon hir that looked back. And ChriſtLuc▪ 9▪ 61. affirmeth, That he is not méete for his kingdome, that putting his hand to the plough, looketh backe. It behooueth all true and vnfained chriſtians, to kéepe a perpetuall conſtancie, in a right courſe, of liuing vertuouſlie, holilie, and godly, and as the holie prophet ſaith, to go from ſtrength to ſtrength, vntill euerie onePſal. 84. 7▪

               IT hath béen vſuall of olde, that men would inquire, and aſke221 of God, by his prophets, concerning thoſe things wherof they doubted. Saule ſéeking his aſſes, did go to a ſéear, to wit, to a1. Sam. 9. prophet, for ſo called they the prophet then. The ſonne of Ieroboam

                     . of Iſrael, the ſcripture ſaith that they were deceiued, and that they did not aſke at the mouth of the Lord, meaning the Lords prophet, by whom he vſed to ſpeake vnto the people. This (I ſay) was very vſuall and common in that time, wherein the prophets liued. Howbeit, all did not come with one minde: for it is to be ſéene, in the prophet Ezechiel, that certaine of the elders of Iſrael,Ezech. 20. came vnto him, to inquire of many things, whereof they doubted, but bicauſe they came not, with a good, but a bad minde, the Lord would vouchſafe them no anſwere. For they came not, as men drawen with the glorie of God, but ſtirred with malice, and their owne iniquitie. They were contented to haue ſome knowledge of the Lords will, but they had no purpoſe, to frame their liues after the ſame. The number of ſuch at this day is infinite,

for who ſées not, how many are very déepely ſéene, in the vnderſtanding of Gods word, and the knowledge of his will, which neuer ſtretch out one hand, nor ſet one foote before another, to practiſe or to do the ſame? They know, and will alſo acknowledge and confeſſe, that they ought to kéepe their harts, their minds, their thoughts, their hands, their hearing, their ſéeing, and all their inward and outward parts, without the foule and filthie ſpots of the world, and to be carefull to walke in innocencie,Pſal. 24. holines and righteouſnes before the Lord, vpon paine to be barred, and ſhut out of his kingdome for euer: and yet theyPſal. 15. will, euen againſt that they knowe, féede fat, and as brawne franke themſelues, with all maner of ſinne and iniquitie. So that, euen as the ſunne, at ſome time of the yéere, in ſome place, doth affoord his ſhine and light vnto the people, and yet doth little or nothing warme them: So, the knowledge and vnderſtanding, of the word, and will of God, doth not by and by, worke an hungring and thirſting, to leade a vertuous and godly life, in all thoſe whom it hath inſtructed, and moſt perfectly taught, what they ſhould do, and how they ought to liue. They receiue knowledge and vnderſtanding from it, but they refuſe the grace, and denie the power of it. But, euen as he is not rightly called a rich man, which vnderſtandeth and knoweth great riches, and can tell how, and by what meanes, a man may be excéeding rich, but he that hath riches of his owne, and doth poſſeſſe them: So, he is not a good, and right Chriſtian man, that can according to knowledge, diſpute and reaſon of vertue, and godlines, and can deſcribe and define the ſame: but he that is indued with vert

                   and poſſeſſed with true godlines, and doth moſt willingly practiſe the ſame, in the whole courſe of his life, both with his friends, and with his foes, that man, and ſuch a woman, is rightly called, andMatth. 5▪
                   is indéede, a true Chriſtian, in whom the Lord hath great delight. The lord vouchſafe to make many ſuch. Otherwiſe knowledge (when it is bare and naked, without the loue of God, and man) doth puffe men vp with inſolencie and pride, ſo that the1. Cor. 8. more they knowe, the woorſe they are, and muſt be beaten with the moe ſtripes, bicauſe they know the will of God, and do it not. We all are hailed, and drawen after, an earneſt deſire of knowledge and vnderſtanding, but we muſt do our greateſt and beſt indeuour, that our knowledge may be coupled with vertue and true godlines: for he that knoweth what he himſelfe ought to

do, and will point and teach others, what beſt becommeth them to do, and will ſhew them their faults, that they may ſhun them, and yet will not bend and plie himſelfe, to do thoſe good things, whereunto his knowledge doth direct and point him, he is like vnto a cléere and bright looking glaſſe, which ſheweth plainly to others, their blemiſhes and foule ſpots, but ſéeth not it ſelfe. For as the looking glaſſe, doth ſhew very plainly, to them that behold it, the likenes of ſuch men or women, as are before it, that they may dreſſe and trim themſelues, and yet doth not ſée it ſelfe: So that maſter or teacher, which very copiouſly, and eloquently, doth teach others, vertue and all good things, and yet himſelfe giuen to ſinne and wickednes, he doth in déede teach others, but he teacheth not himſelfe. Againſt ſuch maſters and teachers, the holy Apoſtle inueigheth very ſharply, ſaying: Thou which teacheſtRom. 2. another, teacheſt not thy ſelfe: thou ſaieſt a man ſhould not ſteale, and yet thou ſtealeſt: thou ſaieſt that a man ſhould not commit adulterie, and yet thou committeſt adulterie, &amp;c. An heathen man, by the light of nature, and reaſon, could ſay, that notMarcus Tullius in Verrem. onely an accuſer, but ſuch a reproouer alſo, is not tolerable, in whom is wel knowen, and found, the ſame fault, which he ſharply checketh and reprooueth in another. And the ſame man in anIdem in Salust. other place doth ſay: that he which is prepared, to ſpeake againſt another man, muſt be without all fault himſelfe. And another man alſo, no leſſe a heathen than he, compareth thoſe men, which will ſpeake good things, and will not do them, to a ſwéete inſtrument; which will ſound very ſwéetly, and make a pleaſant noiſe, wherewith it will greatly delight others, and yet it neither heareth, nor vnderſtandeth it ſelfe. True it is, that good ſpéeches in men, are in danger to be loſt, and to do little or no good, when they be not holpen, and in ſome meaſure furthered, with the good life, and honeſt maners, of thoſe that ſpeake them: when knowledge hath vertue ioined with it, then hath it woonderful effects, and indéede, that is the knowledge that all Chriſtians ought to ſéeke for, and to deſire. For, to deſire to haue knowledge, onely that thou maieſt knowe, is nothing elſe, but curioſitie: and to deſire to knowe, that thou maieſt be knowen, to know much, is méere vanitie: and to deſire to know, that therby thou maieſt attaine to worldly wealth, promotion, and dignifie, what is it elſe, but filthy lucre? but to deſire knowledge, that therby thou maieſt be touched, &amp; mightily inflamed, with an vnfained loue of God,

and thy neighbor, and that thou maieſt mooue, and ſtir vp others to the ſame, is an excellent vertue.
            
            
               THe bodie of man, that it may not rebell againſt the ſpirit,222 muſt be reſtrained, and kept ſhort of many things, that it will craue, otherwiſe it will be very vnruly, if with meaſure kéeping and abſtinence, it be not tamed and kept vnder: therefore as the Apoſtle ſaith, it muſt be crucified, with the luſtsGalat. 5. and concupiſcences of the ſame. For euen as, from a fierce and firie horſe, which will in no wiſe be ruled, nor obey his rider, men are woont to withdrawe, ſuch ſtrong féede, and fine prouender, as will make him ouer hote, and to too fierce, and in ſtéede thereof, to giue him chaffe and bare ſtraw: Euen ſo from the bodie of man, when it is an enimy to the ſpirit, and by reaſon of too much daintie fare, and varietie of delicate chéere, groweth to be wanton, and rebellious againſt reaſon, muſt plentie of fine féede and nouriſhing meates be taken, and harder and leaner chéere, muſt be very ſparingly miniſtred vnto it, that when by ſuch meanes, it is ſubdued and chaſtened, it may willingly yéeld obedience vnto the ſoule and ſpirit. The holy Apoſtle of Chriſt, himſelfe did ſo: I do chaſten my bodie (ſaith he) and kéepe it vnder, leaſt whiles1. Cor. 9. I preach to others, I my ſelfe ſhould be a caſtaway. And indéede when the body of man is tamed, and kept in ſubiection, then doth the ſpirit, ſtir vp it ſelfe more fréely, to the obedience of God, and ſéeketh after the diuine and holy myſteries of his word, with greater zeale and feruencie. For, as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith: Although2. Cor. 4. our outward man be corrupted, yet that which is within, is renewed day by day. For as enimies in a ſiege, will yéelde themſelues to their aduerſaries, when for want of foode, they are like to be famiſhed: ſo the fleſh and ſenſualitie of man, being bitter enimies vnto the ſoule, if pampering, and daintie, and full féeding be taken away, will ſubmit themſelues, and will ſtoupe vnto the ſoule and ſpirit. When the diſciples of Chriſt demanded of him, why they could not caſt out a certaine euill and wicked ſpirit, he anſwered them, that that kinde of ſpirit, was not to be caſt out, but onely by praier and faſting: Meaning that the Lord,Marc. 9. had reſerued vnto himſelfe, the caſting out of that ſpirit, who muſt beſought vnto, by faithfull, feruent, and moſt earneſt praier, and bicauſe he would haue the whole man, in that holy exerciſe of praier, to ſerue him, and bicauſe the bodie ſhould be no impediment

or hinderance, vnto the power and force of praier, but in all humilitie, ſhould moſt willingly ioine with the ſoule and ſpirit, in that ſeruice of God, and ſo iointly togither, ſhould crie mightily vnto the Lorde, to obtaine their ſuite, Chriſt woulde haue the bodie tamed and humbled with faſting. And in the mouth of his holy prophet Ioel, he willeth the people, to turne vnto him, in faſting, wéeping, and mourning, and that with theirIoel. 1. whole harts, without all hypocriſie. And therefore Chriſt ſaith: When ye faſt, be not ſad as hypocrites are, &amp;c. But the king ofMatth. 6. Niniue did eaſily ſée and perceiue, that neither faſting, praying,Ionas. 2. nor any other exerciſe, would preuaile with God, vnleſſe men would forſake their ſinnes, and giue ouer their iniquities: And therefore he ſtraightly charged, that euery man ſhould turne, from the euill they had vſed. And ſo the Lord grant we may do, and then our other exerciſes, of praying and faſting, and ſuch like, wil be acceptable to God, otherwiſe they be friuolous, vaine and hypocriticall.
            
            
               
                  PLinie in his eighteth booke, doth report, that Bucephalus,
                  223 the horſe of Alexander the great, when he had not on the braue and princely furniture, which was prouided for Alexander himſelfe, he would ſuffer any other man, as well as Alexander, to ride him: but being furniſhed and made readie with the kings furniture, he would ſuffer no man, but Alexander himſelfe, to take his backe: So very many men, all the while they are poore, obſcure, and in baſe eſtate, they will indure euery man, and will faine a good will, and great diligence towards all men, and to euery one, they will ſhew a ſingular mildnes, and kinde courteſie, being to ſée to, moſt mild and courteous Catoes, but inwardly very tyrannicall and cruell Neroes. They couer and kéepe cloſe, within the ſecret folds, and priuie corners of their manifold diſſimulations, wrath, hatred, malice, enuie, and all impietie: but once being inriched, full of worldly wealth, and aduanced to honor and dignitie in the world, and lifted vp into the place, and ſet in the ſeate of authoritie, then they deſpiſe and ſcorne all men, ſaue onely thoſe, to whom by the lawe of ſoueraigntie, they are bound to be ſubiect, and to obey. Then they vnhood themſelues, and do bewray their ſecret will, and do diſcouer their cankered and manifold nature, which lay hid ſo cloſe, in the wrinkles of their hypocriſie, and deceit, that it could not be ſéene:

then do they moſt openly ſhew, their pride, and crueltie, which they had long couered with a goodly mantle and faire cloke of humilitie and lowlines. It is the Lords manner and vſe, to caſt downe and to bring lowe, all ſuch proude, vaine, forgetfull, and vnthankfull perſons: &amp; to aduance, and to exalt all thoſe, which in true humilitie, and lowlines of hart and minde, in pietie, patience, and in the practiſing of all vertues, do ſerue, honor, loue, and obey him. The Lord neither regardeth the riches of the vngodly, nor the poore and beggerly eſtate, of his faithfull children, and choſen ſeruants. Of the wicked, Dauid ſaith: Thon haſt caſtPſal. 73. them downe, Lord, &amp;c. and of his owne he ſaith: The iuſt man ſhall floriſh like a palme trée, and as a Cedar of Libanus ſhall he be multiplied. And againe: The righteous ſhall be in an euerlaſtingPſal. 112. remembrance. Men that were godly learned, in old time, when they perceiued, that man forgetting his originall, and the foule matter of his beginning, would waxe inſolent, and growe proud: they would expreſſe and ſignifie him, by a crocodile and an egge. For the crocodile is a creature of an incredible bignes, and yet hath his beginning of a very ſmall and little egge, and is knowen onely to Egypt, and to thoſe countries, which are watered with the riuer Nilus, and in this thing is very admirable, that no liuing creature, that hath ſo ſmall a beginning, doth growe to ſuch an excéeding bignes. And yet in this one thing, man is more admirable, that being moulded out of the earth and duſt, he will make his hart a neſt for pride and all abhomination, to build and to dwell in.
            
            
               THe comminations of the Lord, by the prophet Ezechiel,
                  224 are not onely againſt Pharao the king of Egypt, but doEzech. 29. reach alſo, to all them, which do imitate him, and ſticke to him, in his tyrannie, and cruell practiſes, whom the prophet tearmeth by the name of fiſhes. For euen as, when ſome great and huge fiſh, is drawen out of a riuer in a net, many ſmal ones, which are about him, are taken and drawn out with him: Right ſo, it is the Lords maner, not onely to tangle and to trap, within the infringible net, of his indignation &amp; heauy iudgements, the firſt authors, and chéefe bruers, and brochers of idolatrie, treaſon, trecherie, or any other kinde of euill whatſoeuer: But all thoſe alſo will he cenſure, with the ſame weight and meaſure of puniſhment, which haue anie pleaſure in thoſe forbidden euils, and

are ſo far, from being offended, and gréeued at the ſame, that they wiſh in their harts, good ſucceſſe, and continuance vnto them. I will (ſaith the Lord) euen glue &amp; faſten vnto thy ſkales, the fiſhes of thy floods or riuers, and I wil draw thée out of the midſt of thy riuers, and all thy fiſhes ſhall ſticke vnto thée, &amp;c. Meaning, thatIbidem. he would deſtroy not only himſelfe, but all his followers alſo, togither with all thoſe, that by any means did fauor or further, and did giue or lend vnto him, their cōpany, counſell, goods, ſtrength, voices, or ſo much as one hartie wiſh or deſire, to ſet forward his malice and crueltie, againſt the Lord and his ſeruants. And ſo indéede it came to paſſe. Therefore it behooueth all men, to haue a good and ſure ground, for euery thing that they do, and that neither companie drawe them, nor authoritie conſtraine them, nor feare to loſe goods, libertie, nor life, driue and compell them, to do that thing, which is directly againſt the worde, and will of God, and is by him abſolutely forbidden. And this is well woorth the marking, that the prophet doth cal men fiſhes, which are toſſed and tumbled, in the troubleſome waters, and waues of the world. For what els is this world, but a ſea, continually diſquieted with fearce flouds, of infinite temptations, &amp; toſſed with ſtormes of innumerable troubles, and ſhaken with windes of al maner of vanities? Is there any Euripus, Syrtes, or Charybdis, that hath ſo many, and ſo monſtrous flouds, and dangerous waues, and that hath ſo ſundrie, and ſtormy motions, as this world hath? What vaſt gulph, what ſtrait and narrow ſea, is ſhaken with ſuch whirlewindes, and troubled with ſuch bluſtering blaſts, ſuch raging ſtormes, and cruel tempeſts, &amp; with ſuch thicke, blacke, and vncomfortable clouds, as this world is? There be in the ſea of this world, two chéefe and principal fiſhers, the one is Chriſt, our moſt ſwéete and only ſauiour: the other is the diuel, our moſt cruel, and deadly enimy. Chriſt doth fiſh for men, that he may giue them life, and ſaue them for euer: but the diuel doth fiſh for men, that he may bind them in the chaines of death, and deſtroy them for euer. The waters of the ſea of this world, are worldly riches, dignities, promotions, fleſhly luſts, and filthy pleaſures, &amp; they are like bitter and ſalt water, which will neuer quench a mans thirſt, but the more he drinketh, the thirſtier he is. But the water of Chriſt, doth indéed quench the thirſt, of him that drinketh it, and doth laie the heate, of the luſtes, and lawleſſe deſires of the fleſh. For he himſelfe doth ſaie: That if a

man drink of the water of this world, he ſhal thirſt again: But if he drinke of the water (ſaith he) that I wil giue him, he ſhall notIoh. 4. Luc. 16. thirſt for euer. The rich man mentioned in the Goſpell, had his belly ful of the water of this world, but now he is tortured in the heate, and tormented in the flames of hell, &amp; ſhal be a thirſt there for euer: But poore Lazarus that ſought for the water of Chriſt, &amp; did drinke of it, is now in heauen, in the boſome of euerlaſting bleſſednes, and ſhall neuer be a thirſt any more. Chriſt doth fiſh for men, that he may draw them out of the bitter waters of this dangerous ſea, and that he may giue vnto them, the water of grace. But Chriſt doth fiſh with an angling rod, and an hooke, and he taketh few. But the diuell, that wicked and craftie fiſher, with his great, large, long, and broade nets, taketh and draweth vp great multitudes, and infinite numbers of fiſhes, which voluntarily giue themſelues vnto him, and do ſuffer him moſt eaſilie to take them. Chriſt doth fiſh, that he may bring grace, and giue vnto them, whom he taketh, eternall life, and the fiſhes flie from him, they will not come néere him: And the diuell doth fiſh, that he may kill and deſtroy, and bring men into endleſſe, eaſeleſſe, and remedileſſe, condemnations and torments, and the fiſhes run and flie to him. Chriſt as he walked by the ſea of Galilee,Matth 4. with his angle tooke ſoure, Symon and Andrew, Iames and Iohn: but the diuell walking by the ſea of this world, may in as little ſpace and ſhort time, take foure thouſand. The diuel fiſheth with a hooke, and doth catch many mo, then Chriſt doth take, the reaſon is, bicauſe his baite is ſwéeter, and more pleaſant to mans appetite, and doth better agrée with the depraued will and graceleſſe diſpoſition of man, then that baite which Chriſt vſeth, doth. The diuels baite, is voluptuouſnes, the foule pleaſures,The diuels baite. and rotten delights of the fleſh, worldly wealth at will, the vaine glory of the world, innumerable riches of all ſorts, power, authoritie, vanitie, an inſatiable deſire to beare rule, and a thouſand ſuch others. The ſéelie poore fiſhes being deceiued with theſe baites, do neuer féele the hooke, vntill it ſticke ſo faſt in their iawes, that there is no ſcaping, but the diuell maketh a full account of them, as of his owne. The Lord giue vs grace, and ſo open the eies of our vnderſtanding, that we may ſée, and eſchew all his baites, and neuer be taken with any hooke of his. But our ſweet Sauiour Chriſt, that heauenly fiſher, which ſéeketh to ſaue our ſoules, and to bring them to euerlaſting happines, and celeſtiall

immortalitie, he fiſheth with a ſharpe and bitter baite, verieChriſts baite vnpleaſant to the corrupted nature, and appetite of a naturall man, to wit: with much faſting, praieng often, with watchings, honeſt labours in a mans calling, contempt of the world, ſpirituall pouertie, bitter teares, déepe ſighes, and gréeuous grones, for ſinnes committed againſt the Lord, with humilitie and lowlines of hart, with kindnes, peace, patience, righteouſnes, and ſuch other things, all which, although to thoſe, which are inflamed with a right and true loue of God, they are pleaſant and welcome, yet not the leſſe, to the will and deſire of a méere naturall man, that is a friende of fleſh and blood, they are hard, &amp; do ſéeme very bitter to his corrupted taſte. God grant that we may ſo ſwallow vp all theſe, and other ſuch like baites, that wée may be ſurely taken with the Lords hooke, and drawne to euerlaſting life, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
               Amen.
            
            
               SAthan is a ſubtle fiſher, and vſeth great cunning in the caſting225 of his net, and ſearcheth out, that veine of water, wherin euery one is delighted, and do take their pleaſures: for he doth not ſet vpon all men, after one &amp; the ſame maner. He tempteth one with riches, and another with the flickerings, and pleaſures of the world: he draweth one on with pride, another with malice and enuie: he winneth ſome through too much ſpending, and many thouſands through too much ſparing, euen as he perceiueth, the inclination of euery man to be. The mouth of his net, is very broad, and the going in is very wide, and open, but the comming out is very hard, ſtraight, and narrow, and founde of none▪ or verie few. For euen as a fiſher, when he taketh ſome great fiſh, doth not by and by violently ſtrike, and twich hir, but letteth his fiſhing line go at all the length, vntill the fiſh do ſwallow downe the hooke, and ſo worke hir owne deſtruction, leaſt if at the firſt, he ſhould twich hir too hard, the fiſhing line or thread ſhould breake, and his baite and hooke loſt, the fiſh ſhould eſcape: Euen ſo the diuell, when he hath gotten a poore ſinner, faſt vpon his hooke, and hath intangled and fettered him, in the chaynes of ſome dangerous and deadly ſinne, and hath bewitched him, with the ſorceries of the fleſh, and the world, he doth not ſuddenly oppreſſe and exaſperate him, leaſt if at the firſt daſh, he plaie the diuell openly, and roughly, like a diuell as he is, the ſinner ſhould break his bands, and eſcape his ſnares: But he doth cheriſh him,

and maketh much of him, and doth ſuffer him now and then, both to ſpeake and to do ſome things that ſauor of vertue, that by litle and litle, he being made faſt and dead ſure, vpon the hooke of ſin and wickednes, he may by degrées worke his owne wo and vtter deſtruction. So that the diuell doth ſtretch out his angling rod, thread and all, not that he may let the ſinner eſcape, but that he may make him the ſurer, and holde him the faſter. Thus ſuffered he Herode, to pretend in words the worſhipping of Chriſt, when he intended in his hart to kill him: And Pilate to confeſſe Chriſts innocencie, and yet againſt his owne conſcience, to giue ſentence of death againſt him: And Iudas to kiſſe Chriſt, as though he loued him, and euen then to betraie him: Theſe and many mo like them, notwithſtanding their painted and golden ſhewes, were faſt inough, vpon the diuels hooke, and ſo are al hypocrites and diſſemblers.
            
            
               THere is a ſea, called the dead ſea, which is a lake in Iudea,226 called Aſphaltites, whereof Ariſtotle, Pliny, Iuſtine, and diuers others do make mention. There is neither fiſh, nor any liuing creature found in it, whereupon it hath the name dead. Further, in it nothing is couered, neither doth any thing that is in it, ſinke to the bottome thereof, but all things do ſwim, and are in ſight, and do continue in the top of the water. For which cauſe, they are compared vnto it, that will kéepe no counſell, nor ſecrets whatſoeuer, but will reueale, and bewraie all things that they know whether they be good or bad. It is a mightie great lake, and is neuer troubled, with anie waues, ſtormes, or tempeſts, but is euer quiet: And therefore, they are compared with it, that lead their liues in tranquillitie, peace and quietnes, and are neuer preſſed, nor broken with any calamities, nor toſſed and troubled, with any ſorrowes or miſeries in the worlde, but are euer at harts eaſe, and liue as they liſt. The water of this dead ſea, is reported to be excéeding bitter, for the ſwéete riuer Iordan running into it, (as ſome do write) it doth vtterly loſe the ſwéetnes thereof, and is made very bitter alſo. Euen as Hypanis a ryuer of Scythia, which hath a maruellous ſwéetenes, vntill a litle bitter ſpring, which Herodotus calleth Exampeus, be mingled with it, and then it is corrupted with a woonderfullThey are very dangerous men, which can keepe no counſell, no

                      ſecrets. bitternes: Euen ſo, thoſe men, which are like torne veſſels, that will hold no water, and ſo full of chinkes, that they neither can,

nor will kéepe any ſecrets, or counſell, are very bitter and intollerable men, and do much harme in euery place where they com, neither can any counſell or ſecret be committed vnto ſuch, without great danger to the common wealth wherein they dwell, and eſpecially to all thoſe that repoſe any truſt in them.

There be very many, that do ſome dédes, which to ſée to, are veryHypocrites. good works, but not the leſſe, they kéepe their harts, mindes and wils, diuided and ſeparated far from God. Thoſe things, to wit, their harts, mindes, wils and purpoſes, they ſteale from the Lord, and do beſtow them vpon the world, they regard not God, they ſéeke onely to pleaſe men: in the action of vertue, they haue no reſpect vnto vertue it ſelfe, but onely, and barely, to the ſhew and ſhape, or likenes of vertue. Such men are like vnto painters, which haue a greater regarde, to the colours and ſhadowes, of images and pictures, than vnto the ſubſtance of the ſame, and contemning the inward parts, they beſtow all the wit, ſkill, and cunning they haue, in expreſſing and painting out, a bare ſhadow, and outſide of the thing, and the more they deceiue the eies, of them that behold it, the more excellent men are they iudged. But the Lord requireth at our hands, firſt fruits, that is, our harts, mindes, wils, deſires, and all that is in vs, and that we ſhould euen offer vp, and conſecrate vnto him our ſelues, euenRom. 12.

And when the Apoſtle willeth vs, or rather beſéecheth vs, that we giue our bodies, a liuely ſacrifice, holy, and acceptable to God, and calleth the ſame our reaſonable ſeruice of God: he meaneth, that the offering of dead calues, and vnreaſonable beaſts, as in times paſt, the Iewes offered vnto him, wil not pleaſe God now, neither that the Lord will accept, and take in good part, any ſeruice or ſacrifice, that we ſhall bring, and lay before him, either in words or works, ſo long as we loue ſinne, and harbour iniquitie, in our harts, mindes, and members. The Lord will receiue no ſacrifice, nor ſeruice, of thoſe that be ſtrangers vnto him, but onely of thoſe which are graffed in Chriſt Ieſu, and are now become in him new creatures,1. Cor. 5. in whom there is a newnes, a righteouſnes, and holines of life, &amp; in whom all old, foule, filthie, and vngodly conuerſation is paſt. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, to the Epheſians: Be ye renewed in the ſpirit of your minde, and put ye on the new man:Epheſi. 4. Coloſſ. 3. and to the Coloſſians, he giueth counſell, that they deſtroy the olde man, with all his traſh, and put on the new man: and moſt louingly he beſeecheth the Romanes, ſaying: Let vs walke inRoman. 6. newnes of life. But bicauſe this newnes, cannot be wrought in vs, without the grace, and holy ſpirit of God, Dauid the prophet,Pſalm. 51. doth mightily crie vnto the Lord, and ſaith: O God, create a new hart within me, and renew a right ſpirit within my bowels, or inward parts. The Lord requireth of vs, a lambe, that is, innocencie, humilitie and méekenes: and he would haue vs to offer vnto him, a yoong pigeon, or a turtle doue, that is, true contrition, and puritie of hart, and minde: for thoſe ſwéete birds, do vſe mourning in ſtéed of ſinging, and are pretie, and fine paterns of puritie, and innocencie. The Lord will not take, receiue, nor accept, barking curre dogs, that is, railing, raging, curſing, lying, ſlandering, blaſpheming, or any ſuch vngodly perſons, neither their offerings, ſacrifices, nor praiers, when they come, and bring, and lay them before him, no more than he did the ſacrifice of Caine. The roring and cruell lion, the rauening wolfe, the foule and dirtie ſwine, the blinde mole, or want: that is, the tyrannicall, and mercileſſe man, the oppreſſor, piller, and poller of his brethren, the man that is méere naturall, and carnall, the man that is blinde, and ignorant, in ſpirituall and heauenly things, they are neither ſacrifices, nor ſacrificers, that God will,

or is woont, to take any pleaſure in: as he doth abhorre the vices, ſo for the vices ſake, he doth deteſt the veſſels, vntill ſuch time, as they be purged and clenſed, of ſuch foule and filthie matter. If there were no other, but onely Salomon, to tell vs, that the Lord requireth, and calleth for our harts, it is great reaſon, that we ſhould beléeue the Lord at one word, and at one meſſage, when ſo louingly, and fatherly he ſaith: My ſonne giue me thy hart.Prouerb. 23.

Such men will lift vp their hands, eies, and voices, towards heauen and God, and with ſuch goodly gréene leaues, will make a faire floriſh, and a beautfull ſhew, but their harts and affections, are ſurely ſet, vpon earthly, vaine, vile, and tranſitorieEſa. 29.

So that, we can no way, make the Lord a banket, that will pleaſe, and delight him, but by forſaking the world, our ſinnes, and our ſelues, and in appealing to the throne of his grace, and mercies ſeate. We heare his voice euery day, what meane we, that we obey it not? Why continue we in ſinne, which conſumeth, and rotteth our ſoules and bodies, as ruſtines doth iron? Why go we not home, to our heauenly father? We know his goodnes, we haue great experience of his clemencie, loue and mercie, and yet ſtill we linger. Our patrimonie is gone, we haue moſt lewdly ſpent, waſted, and conſumed all, ſo that we are no more woorthie to enter into the kingdome of God, than are the very foule, and dirtie ſwine, and yet nothing wil driue vs to him. It is euen as himſelfe ſaith: No man can come vnto me, vnleſſe my father drawe him: the Lord then draw vs vnto himſelfe. What a madnes is it, to ſéeke for helpe, reléefe, and comfort of the world, which ſéeketh vs, onely that it may deceiue, and deſtroy vs? The Lord calleth vs, to giue vs comfort, and vnſpeakable ioy, and we turne our backs to him, the world doth but hold vp a finger, and becken vs to it, with a purpoſe to haue our companie to hell and damnation, and we run, and whine after it, like a thirſtie infant, after the dug of his mother, or nurſe. And thus we paſſe on, ſéeking for life in the houſe of death, and for ioy in the vale of miſerie, where none is to be found. The Lord open the eies of our vnderſtanding, and make vs to know, and to ſee, that our helpe, health, comfort, and life, in this world, and in the world to come, ſtandeth onely in him, that made both heauen and earth.

               IDlenes, as it bréedeth pouertie and beggerie, in very many,230 which might liue well, and in good ſort, with diligent, and faithfull labour: So is it very dangerous, in thoſe that be rich, and féele no ſmart, nor want in this life, for whiles they giue themſelues to foule idlenes, voluptuouſnes doth ouercome reaſon, and they are ſnared, and taken in the deadly traps, of the deceitfull flickerings of the world, and are poyſoned with carnall pleaſures, and fleſhly delights, which do beare them faire in hand, for a little while, but at the length do deceiue them, and leaue them in ſhame and confuſion.

                  lie to hir: howbeit at the length, when ſhe perceiueth them, to be vnnaturall and vnkinde to hir, ſhe doth forſake them, and giue them ouer. Euen ſo, our ſwéete Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, hauing taken great paines for vs, and hauing humbled himſelfe, euen in the loweſt degrée, of all humilitie that can be named, as in comming down, out of his fathers boſome, being moſt perfect, moſt holy, and omnipotent God, being euery way equall, and in nothing inferiour to his father, to take our weake, fraile, and féeble nature vpon him, and (ſinne excepted) to haue a perfect féeling of all our infirmities, as weariſomnes of bodie, hunger and thirſt, and ſuch others, and beſides the induring of theſe, many yéeres togither, hauing ſuffered a moſt cruell death, and euen at his death vpon the croſſe, hauing taſted and taken a full cup, of his fathers furie and indignation, which was in déed filled and prepared for vs, as a iuſt reward for our ſinnes, and ſhould haue béen our owne cup, and our owne portion, for euer and euer, had he not euen then taken and ſupt it vp, to cléere and to frée vs from it. Againe, after all theſe things, hauing ſtill continued his humilitie, in ſuffering death, to kéepe his bodie thrée daies in the graue, and euen as it were to tread and trample vpon him, and then mauger death, hell, diuell, and Iewes, hauing riſen againe, and being aſcended and gone vp to his father, where now (vntil his comming again, to iudge the quicke and the dead) he ſitteth at the right hande, of maieſtie and power: He now ſpeaketh and calleth vnto vs, by his prophets, apoſtles, and miniſters, and willeth vs to remember, what caſe and eſtate we were in, before he died, and ſuffered all theſe things for vs, and he would haue vs to know, to be ſure and neuer to forget, that if he had not ſuffered death, héere vpon the earth, as he did, we ſhould neuer haue found, any way or entrance into heauen: the celeſtiall ioyes, and pleaſures of the Lords ſaints, ſaluation and eternall life, ſhould neuer haue belonged vnto vs, we ſhould haue had no more to do with them, then they that liue without faith, and die infidels: The horrors of hell, and the ſtincking lakes of vnſpeakable ſhame, confuſion, torments, endleſſe death, and damnation, ſhould haue béene our inheritance, lot and perpetuall portion. Chriſt therefore doth daily put vs in minde, that we be not our owne but his, and that we be the greateſt and déereſt purchaſe, that euer was made, in

heauen or in earth, and that the like price and coſt, was neuer beſtowed vpon any creatures, as vpon vs. When the angels, which wer
                     •
                   in heauen, in the preſence of their creator, did once offende, they were hurled out, and caſt into hell, Chriſt woulde not beſtow vpon them one peny of all that great price, and rich ranſome, which he paid for vs, he would not then become man, to ſhed one drop of blood for them; but for our ſakes, he ſpared not one drop, but ſhed all. The Hen that himſelfe ſpeaketh of, was neuer ſo diligent and carefull, to gather hir chickins vnderMatth. 23. 37. hir wings, as he hath euer béene, moſt ready to ſhroude and to protect vs, againſt all the enimies of our ſoules and bodies. Many mothers ſhall ſooner forget, the children of their own wombs, and vtterly forſake them, before Chriſt will forſake vs, yea he will neuer forget, nor forſake vs, vnleſſe we firſt forget, and forſake him. Now therefore we being his, ſo déerely bought, and ſo truely paide for, he calleth vpon vs euery day, he clucketh vs, and looketh for vs, that we ſhould follow him, and tread in ſuch ſteps, as he hath appointed, and that we ſhuld not range at randon, but kéepe our ſelues within the hearing of his voice, and our liues within the limits, of obedience vnto the ſame, theſe things (I ſaie) he looketh for at our hands. But how deale we, with this moſt kinde, moſt louing, and moſt mercifull redéemer, and (if the fault be not in our ſelues) the fauiour of our ſeules and bodies? Verily euen ſo, as the vnnaturall and vnkind ducks deale with the hen, of whom they haue receiued life, they regarde not hir clucking, neither we Chriſts calling: when ſhe is ſéeking and prouiding for them, on the faire, drie, and wholeſome earth, they will be in ſome foule water, filthie mire, or ſtinking puddle: And when the Lord Ieſus calleth vs, to integritie of life, to do thePſalm. 15▪

But we on the otherſide, giue nothing leſſe to God, then our harts. What is it, that cannot, and may not command our harts, and haue them at pleaſure, ſooner then Chriſt Ieſus, that with the death of his owne hart, gaue life to our bodies and ſoules? If the worlde do but a little ſmile vpon vs, and giue vs but an alluring looke, and a faire (though a falſe) word, we will by and by follow it, and beſtow vpon it all our attendance.

The courſes we take héere in this life, are very bad, and the end (vnleſſe we repent) is like to be woorſt of all: And whiles we haue no care, to kéepe good conſciences, it is vnpoſſible for vs to kéepe faith. Let ſtande before vs, Chriſt and ſathan, the one pointing vs to heauen, and eternall felicitie, but the way to it, ful of troubles, gréefes, and ſorrowes: the other pointing to hell, but the way to it, ful of delicates, pleaſures, and daintie delights, and let God call, and the diuell call, and (I ſpeake it with gréefe of hart) the diuell is like to haue the greater number to follow him, for thoſe ſhort pleaſures, and

Chriſt but a fewe to follow him, bicauſe they muſt go loden with croſſes. Daily experience doth teach vs no leſſe, when all our actions are carnall, &amp; haue onely but a little outward ſhew, and no taſte at all of true godlines, nor ſo much as any relliſh of the ſpirit, and loue of Chriſt. Some will abſtaine from the committing of many groſſe ſins, now and then, and yet not that, (I feare greatly) in any true and ſincere loue to God, but either for feare of ſhame, and puniſhment in this worlde, or elſe feare of vengeance, in the world to come, which both are vnprofitable, for the Lord hath no pleaſure in forced ſeruice, he will haue it voluntarie, with the hart, and procéeding of loue, not of a ſeruile feare, otherwiſe it ſhall be numbred with the reſt of our ſinnes. This doth greatly condemne vs, that though we do not ſuch things our ſelues, yet we can, without trouble of conſcience, gréefe of hart, or vexation of minde, ſée and heare the Lords name blaſphemed, his ſaboth vnhalowed, idolatrie committed, parents diſhonored, whooredome, theft, murder, and couetouſnes commonly vſed, and all the lawes of God vtterly contemned, and it ſhall neuer offend the greateſt number, ſo much as a thorne in a foote, or a blaine vpon a finger. What other thing is this but to forſake God in the plaine field, and to be afeard to ſerue him in truth and ſinceritie, leaſt we ſhould thereby purchaſe mans diſpleaſure? Vnleſſe therefore, we learne to ſerue him better, in more truth, with greater zeale and ſinglenes of hart, we haue nothing elſe to looke for, but that he will forſake vs, both in this worlde, leauing vs deſtitute of his aſſiſtance, that our enimies may pray vpon vs, and alſo in the world to come, in giuing outMatth. 25. 4

But alas, the moſt part of vs as yet, vntill it ſhall pleaſe the almightie to inrich vs, be like proud beggers, which not being woorth one farthing, will boaſt of great wealth: So many brag of great holines, but haue none,

and of great faith, as though they could remooue mountaines out of their places, and yet know not what true faith is. How fearful a ſaieng is that of Chriſt? When the ſonne of man ſhall comeLuc. 18. 8. to iudge the quicke and the dead, do you thinke, that he ſhal finde any faith vpon the earth? As if he ſhould ſaie, he ſhall finde very little, howſoeuer now all perſwade themſelues, that they be faithfull inough. The Lorde amende vs, for we haue receiued great and infinite good things, from the Lords hand, both for our bodies and ſoules, but in giuing thanks, we are like to the nineLuc. 17. 17. leapers, mentioned in the Goſpell, which neuer turned backe, to thanke God for their healing.

                  MArcus Antoninus with an oration that he made, vpon232 the death of Caeſar, is ſaid to haue greatly delighted the people of Rome, and that he mooued very many of them, to ſhed great ſtore of bitter teares, when he put them in remembrance, of the great benefits, which they had frō time to time, receiued of Caeſar, &amp; withal did ſhew them Caeſars garment, wherin his enimies, Caſſius &amp; Brutus, had ſlaine him, all full of blood: whereat they were ſo mightily mooued, that they expulſed the homicides out of the citie, ſo that they durſt not, if they woulde liue any longer, come néere it: And yet in theſe daies of ours, let come neuer ſo good, and heauenly an orator, with the oracles of God himſelfe, in his mouth, and ſhew moſt plainly, what Chriſt the redéemer of the world, hath done for man, and prooue that man hath receiued vnſpeakable, and innumerable benefits, by and through Chriſt, and declare what bitter teares of water and blood, did trickle downe his chéekes, and what déepe and deadly ſighes, with many fearfull and gréeuous grones, did riſe from his hart, before he came to the croſſe, and let him rip vp his paſſion ſtitch by ſtitch, as the holy booke, and diuine word, ſhall direct and leade him, and let him particularly ſhew, how, and where he was wounded, that he was beaten, ſpit vpon, crowned with thornes, nailed hand and foote to the croſſe, ſcorned and mocked of

the Iewes, and let him ſhew moſt liuely, the wicked and cruell Iewes imbrewing their hands in his blood, &amp; giuing him vineger and gall to drinke: and who for all this will ſhed one teare, giue one grone, or ſigh once from the bottome of his hart? yea let the preacher declare and prooue, that, beſides the death and paſſion of his bodie, he ſuffered in his ſoule, the heauie wrath and indignation of his father, and the extreme tortures and torments of hell, for a time, no leſſe than the reprobates, that be there alreadie, and no leſſe then, all we, by iuſt deſert, ſhould haue ſuffered for euer, if Chriſt had not done it for vs: And who for al this, will driue out of the citie, not Caſſius and Brutus, that killed Caeſar, but thoſe horrible, abhominable, and moſt damnable ſins, for the which Chriſt was ſlaine? For ſo ſaith the ſcripture: He (ſaith the prophet, meaning Chriſt) was wounded for our iniquities.Eſa. 53. And a little after, the prophet bringeth in God himſelfe ſpeaking thus of Chriſt: For the ſinnes of my people haue I ſmitten him. And the Apoſtle telleth the Romanes the ſameRom. 4. thing: Chriſt was giuen (ſaith he) for our offences. And to the Corinthians: Chriſt died for our ſinnes, according to the ſcriptures.1. Cor. 15. The matter then being ſo plaine, that no man, high nor lowe, whoſoeuer, can cléere himſelfe of the death of Chriſt, but muſt néedes, will he, nill he, confeſſe that there is in him, the matter of Chriſts arraignment, bitter paſſion, and curſed death, and that he is no leſſe giltie of the ſame his death and bloodſhedding, than thoſe that cried, Away with him, away with him, it is no reaſon, that he ſhould liue any longer: nor than thoſe, that did ſpit in his face, and nailed his hands and féete to the croſſe. It muſt needes followe, that Caeſar was more beholding to his friends, than the ſonne of God is, to many thouſands of thoſe that do profeſſe his name: and Marcus Antoninus was more beholding to the Romanes, which were ſo readie at one oration, to purge and cléere the citie, of homicides and murthers, than a great number of faithfull preachers of Chriſt be now, to infinite thouſands of their auditors, which are ſo far from abandoning and thruſting out of cities and towns, euen groſſe, vile, and moſt lothſome ſinnes, that in their owne priuate houſes, yea euen in their owne boſoms and bodies, they harbour, nouriſh, and maintaine them: although they heare euery day, the heauie iudgements, and deſtroying wrath of God, denounced againſt them, not with a generall houering ouer their heads, at al aduentures,

as though no body were ſpoken to, but euen with a particular▪ toutching, and as it were an vnlacing of euery ſinne in it kind, to lay open the ſtinch and abhomination of the ſame, that men might (if they had grace) be aſhamed, and afeard, to ſtaine and to blemiſh themſelues with ſuch things, as the Lord vpon paine of condemnation, hath inhibited and forbidden: and yet all will not ſerue. No man, that will beleeue the holy ſcripture, can be ignorant of this, that the almightie, did, with the heauie hand of hisIob. 4. 18. wrath, caſt angels out of heauen, when they were poiſoned with pride, and would not be contented with their owne eſtate, and2. Pet. 2. 4.

And yet all theſe ſinnes, with infinite others, do in as bad maner, and no leſſe meaſure, ſwarme, raigne and reuell in England, than when they were at the woorſt, they did in Sodom. What ſequele then is to be feared, and daily to be looked for, with ſilence I paſſe ouer. There is neuer a man, that beareth the name of a Chriſtian, but he will confeſſe, that his great grandfather Adam, was expulſed, and thruſt out of paradiſe,Geneſ. 3. for eating one apple, forbidden him by the Lord, vpon paine of death: and yet that man, that with open mouth, will make that confeſſion, will euery day eate ſeuen apples, as bitter and as ſtraightly forbidden as that: and will he then, for eating ſeuen, thinke to ſcape better cheape, than his grandfather that did eate but one? No, no: the eater of ſeuen, ſhall finde the way, into euerlaſting life, as hard to enter, as the way into paradiſe, was to his grandfather, being once thruſt out, vnleſſe he ſpéedily, earneſtly, and truly repent him, and giue ouer the eating, of ſuch fruits, as the Lord hath forbidden him. It is very ſtrange, that the iudgements of God, ſhewed vpon Caine, for killing his brother:Gen. 4. 8.
                  
vpon Saule for his diſobedience: vpon Iudas for his treaſon:2. Sam. 15. Matth 27. 5. Act. 1. 18. will not make all men to deteſt and to hate murther, to loue obedience, and to beware of trecherie and treaſon: but that men will ſtill liue as they liſt, as though they were perſuaded, that either God doth not ſée them, or elſe not regarde them, and that he will neuer call them to any account, do what they will, all is one, God is not angrie, nothing diſpleaſeth him: or at the leaſt, as though they had couenanted, and agréed with hell and condemnation, without controlment, or feare of paine, to take their pleaſures in all vanities, and abhominations whatſoeuer. Is it not a woonder, that we ſéeing before our eies (if we will beléeue God) a whole world drowned, with an vniuerſal deluge, or generall flood of water, and yet the ſame ſinnes, that were the cauſe of that generall deſtruction, to be ſo pleaſant &amp; ſweete vnto vs, as is the honie, and the honie combe? well, wel, ſwéete meats, wil haue ſower ſauce.

All theſe, and ſuch other things, are written for our learning,Rom. 14. 4. that we beholding the Lords wrath, executed vpon ſo manie, in all ages, and from one generation to another, for diſpleaſing and offending the Almightie, we might beware, and take héede, that we do not the like déeds, leaſt we be beaten with the

Can we liue without feare, and a continuall looking, for the like preſente, and ſodaine death our ſelues, when our owne conſciences, earely or late, at home or obroad, ſhall checke, and charge vs, as truely and as iuſtly as their conſciences did checke and charge them? With how many and how great, fearefull and deuouring plagues, that haue ſwallowed vp, infinite thouſands of men, women, and children, hath the Lord tried vs, and moſt louingly admoniſhed vs, in England within theſe few yéeres? Hath not the whole maſſe, and weight of the earth, trembled, tottered, and ſhaken vnder vs, as though it euen groned, and were excéeding wearie, of our ſinnes, rebellion, and diſobedience towards our creator, and redéemer, and that of late within our owne knowledge, and remembrance? And yet for all that, we procéede in our wickednes, and are woorſe and woorſe euerie day. So that we ſéeme to be that wicked crue, and pack of fooles, mentioned by the prophet, which haue ſaid in their harts, there is no God. Thoſe mariners, and méere idolaters, which werePſalm. 14.

Are we not woorſe then thoſe Iewes, which crucified the ſon of God, euen Ieſus Chriſt? Surely we be: for they hearing Peter preach, but one ſermon, aAct. 2. 37. 38. &amp; 39. great number of them were conuerted: But we hearing manie hundreds, are neuer touched with any remorſe of conſcience, nor mooued to any ſerious, or true repentance.

We do nothing for gods ſake, nothing of conſcience, nothing of loue, all our actions (the Lord amend it) do ſauour and ſmell of hypocriſie. It is to be feared, that were it not, for vaine glory ſake, and to haue commendations and praiſes of men, verie few would do any good: and were it not, for feare of ſhame, or puniſhment, few would abſtaine from any ſinne.

Againe, the harts of al men are in the hands of God, as he made them of nothing, now they are made to conuert men from ſinne: Let all the ſeruants, and children of God, in this caſe trie, what they can do with the Lorde, and neuer giue ouer calling vpon him, for their ſaluation, if it be his will to grant it.

True it is (good reader) that we ought to deſire, to liue no longer, than we haue a care to liue well, and that the whole courſe of our liues, may be acceptable to God: That is the Apoſtles meaning,2.

Cor. 5. 15. died for vs, that hencefoorth we ſhould not liue to our ſelues, but vnto him that died for vs. Therefore it is a méere vanitie, to ſay we be Chriſtians, vnleſſe we caſt from vs, our old corruptions, and cuſtome of ſinning, and be changed in our mindes, and becomeIbidem. 17. new creatures in Chriſt Ieſu. The which thing, I do moſt humbly craue at the hands of God, euen for his owne name, and his onely ſonne Chriſt Ieſus his ſake, both for thée and me, that when the daies of our miſeries, in this dangerous and troubleſome world, ſhall be expired, thou and I may haue a ioifull méeting, with the reſt of the Lords ſaints, and all his holy angels, in the glorie of his endleſſe, bleſſed, and eternall kingdome, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: to whom be all honour, power, praiſe, glorie, and dominion, now, and world without end.

               The ſeruants of God, do profit very much, by cruell perſecutions, and tyrannicall dealings, of their enimies, and thinke themſelues happie, that they are thought woorthie to ſuffer any thing for Chriſts ſake,  S. 112. P. 52.
               The more that▪ an humble and faithfull chriſtian, ſhall read or heare the worde of God, and the neerer in vnderſtanding and knowledge, that he ſhal com vnto the myſteries, &amp; ſecrets of God, conteined in his word, and with the greater purity of mind, ſtrength of faith, and light of the grace of God, he ſhal looke into them, the more profound, the deeper, the more diuine and heauenly, and the more comfortable to his ſoule, ſhall he finde them,  S. 113. P. 53.
               A man is neuer farther ſhort, of the true knowledge of the will and meaning of God in his word, then when he thinketh with his own wits and cunning, to vnderſtand it beſt,  S. 114. P. 54.
               The cleere and bright light of the word of God, is very comfortable to ſuch as feare him, and loue his name, but vnto the vngodly it is very offenſiue,  S. 115. P. 54.
               The hart of man being inflamed, with a true and ſincere loue of God, will giue no place to thoſe dāgerous temptations, which are continually houering, and flieng about it: but being without that loue, and being ſlothfull and idle in holy things, and godlie exerciſes, it wil be obuious, and wide open, to all maner of miſchiefes, and will be a receptacle of all wickednes and abhominations,  S. 116. P. 54. &amp; 55.
               The peace and vnitie of the church of Chriſt, is by all poſſible meanes, to be preſerued, and by the example of Chriſt, we muſt do euen that we need not to do, rather then diſturbe the vnitie of the church, the breakers of that peace are moſt wicked men,  S. 117. P. 55.
               There be many in theſe daies, which are not aſhamed, to ſaie, that the church of England, is not the church of Chriſt, bicauſe they can finde no comfort in it. The reaſon why they finde no comfort in it, is declared,  S. 118. P. 56.
               Man without the light of grace, and the aſſiſtance of Gods moſt holie ſpirit, can neuer attaine to the arriuing, at the hauen of eternall glory,  S. 119. P. 56.
               They that be in authoritie, and are to laie their hands vpon men, to call them into the miniſterie, are to take heede, that they be

men very fit for that function and high calling. If they do not, they are condemned, by Chriſt his owne example, yea the foules of the aire do condemne them,  S. 120. P. 56.
               Though Chriſt Ieſus, our ſauiour, touching his manhood, be in heauen at the right hand of maieſtie &amp; power, yet the eies of his mercy are ſtil euen to the end of the world, vpon his ſeruants, to defend and preſerue them from their enimies: and on the otherſide, they with the eies of their faith do ſtill behold him, and call to him, for helpe, in the perilous times of troubles, and dangers,  S. 121. P. 57.
               To retaine and holde, a faſhion or likenes of vertue, without the ſubſtance of it, is nothing elſe but meere hypocriſie,  S. 122. P. 58.
               They that do counterfeit holines &amp; haue none, are compared to ſwans, whoſe feathers are white, and fleſh blacke,  S. 123. P. 58.
               Godly men, that are truely regenerated, and well ſeaſoned with the ſpirit of grace, though they be bred and borne in the world, yet they very little or nothing, reſemble it: they rather reſemble heauen in ſome meaſure, from whence they receiue the influēce, of the grace and fauor of God,  S. 124. P. 58.
               Preachers of the word of God, muſt temper, and frame themſelues, to meete with the maners, qualities, conditions, and ſinnes of all men,  S. 125. P. 59.
               The preacher of the word, is to take good heed, that none of his hearers, for want of diſcretion in him, depart vntouched,  S. 126. P. 59.
               A preacher muſt do his beſt indeuour, to know the maners, qualities, and diſpoſitions of his auditorie,  S 127. P. 59.
               A Chriſtian will ſhew patience, and conſtancie in all calamities,  S. 128. P. 59.
               Whatſoeuer is in the hart of man, at the length it will breake out. For not onelie the toong will ſpeake, but the reſt of the members of the bodie, wil alſo be exerciſed, according to the abundance of the hart,  S. 129. P. 60.
               That common wealth, houſe, or man, is very happie, that is ruled, and gouerned by ſuch counſell, as is grounded, and built vpon the holy word of God,  S. 130. P. 60.
               By our words, deedes, geſtures, and moouings, our enimie ſathan, doth knowe the ſecrets of our harts, and ſo worketh vpon vs,  S. 131. P. 60. &amp; 61.
               The hart of man is like vnto a ſmithes forge: his bad cogitations are hote coles, he that doth blowe the bellowes to make them burne and conſume both ſoules and bodies, is the diuell, the euill thoughts in mans hart, are compared, to the frie of vipers, which in comming to light, do breake the bellies of their breeders, and ſo kill them,  S. 132. P. 61.
               The neareſt waie for man, to obtain Gods fauour, and free remiſſion of ſinnes, is to acknowledge and confeſſe them, with greefe of hart, for committing of them, and not to doubt through Ieſus Chriſt, the forgiuenes of them, and not to truſt to any merits, or righteouſnes of his owne,  S. 133. P. 62.
               Nothing in the word of God, is ſuperfluous, it muſt all be beleeued, imbraced, and honored, with all obedience poſſible. It is not gold and earth togither, that a man may take the one, and refuſe the other, it is all moſt pure, and all to be applied to the comfort of man,  S. 134. P. 62.
               This world will coſen, and deceiue all that put their truſt in it, S. 135 P. 63.  
               Sathan doth very eaſily, drawe after him, euen whither, and to what he will, men that are not ſetled in true religion, nor armed with the holy word of God, yea the beſt armed, and ſtrongeſt in faith, haue much adoe to eſcape his ſnares,  S. 135. P. 63.
               They that are continually exerciſed, with great troubles, and afflictions in this life, are not to be iudged reprobates, and caſt awaies, as though God had giuen them ouer, but rather we are to thinke, that by that meanes, the Lord will throughly trie them, and finding them faithfull and conſtant, doth make them the fitter for his kingdome; neither are we to iudge all to bee the children of God, that liue without afflictions,  S. 136. P. 63. &amp; 64.
               Vnleſſe a man be well grounded in true

religion, and clothed with the armor of righteouſnes, on the right hand, and on the left, to wit on euery ſide, and againſt all brunts, and aſſaults whatſoeuer, he ſhall neuer quit himſelfe well, againſt the ſubtle ſleights, and forcible tentations, of his profeſſed enimies, world, fleſh and diuell,  S 137. P. 65.
               If man woulde remember, that he was moulded of earth, duſt, and aſhes, and that he muſt be tumbled, into the earth againe, it would bring him, to a far better temper than otherwiſe hee will bee brought vnto,  S. 138. Pag. 65.
               The groundworke of Chriſtian philoſophie, is vnfained humilitie, and the deeper that the ſame, is laid and ſetled in our harts, the ſurer and more permanent, will the building of our religion be.  S. 139. &amp; 140. P. 66.
               The centre, from whence the lines, of all abhominations do flowe, is mans inordinate ſelfe loue. Two loues builded two cities, the loue of God Ieruſalem, and mans ſelfe loue Babylon,  S. 141. P. 66. &amp; 67.
               There is no miſerie comparable to this, that a man knoweth not his owne miſerie: and of follies, none greater, than that a man ſeeth not his owne follie,  S. 141. P. 67.
               After great troubles, do follow quietnes, of hart and minde, and peace of ſoule and conſcience,  S. 142. P. 67.
               Ouermuch eaſe, and pampering of the bellie, are great prouocations to ſinne,  S. 143. P. 67. &amp; 68.
               They which care not, to keepe a good conſcience, do at the length fall into an extreme contempt of faith: he that will haue his faith acceptable in the ſight of God, muſt keepe a good conſcience, otherwiſe his faith is dead,  S. 144. P. 68.
               The riches of couetous tyrants, increaſing, the wealth of inferior perſons doth decreaſe: and as couetouſnes doth increaſe in men, vertues do decreaſe in them. Riches are the gift of God, and to be beſtowed to his owne glorie, and the comfort of our brethren. The couetous man in gaining riches, loſeth himſelfe. The couetous man, if he had more golde, and greater riches, than was in that ſhip which came from Ophyre to Salomon, yet would he neuer be contented, nor any whit neare ſatisfied,  S. 145. &amp; 146. P. 68. 69. &amp; 70.
               The riches of this world, are to verie many poiſon, but godly men poſſeſſe their riches, and not their riches them. Their riches are drudges to them, and not they to their riches,  S. 147. P. 70.
               As the touch ſtone trieth golde, ſo golde trieth man. A very good hunteſman and his hounds,  S. 148. P▪ 71.
               Not to giue vnto the poore, if a man be able to giue, is ſacrilege. It is a very lamentable thing, to ſee and conſider, how vi

                  ely and wickedly, manie men do lauiſh out, and conſume the riches wherewith God hath put them in truſt, to vſe them to his owne glorie, and the good of his church,  S. 149. P. 72.
               Chriſt ſuffered and died as he was man, but as he is God, he neither ſuffered, nor died. All that be ſurely grounded, and graffed in Chriſt Ieſu, whatſoeuer tribulations, and heauie croſſes they beare in their bodies, yet their faith, hope, and loue to God, will neuer ſhrinke, but they will be conſtant, come what ſhall,  S. 150. P. 73.
               Wicked men are neuer ſatisfied, with committing of any euill, they make no ende of their vngodly practiſes, the more euill they do, the more ſtill, do they deſire to do,  S. 151. P. 73. &amp; 74.
               The vnskilfull, and vngodly miniſter, that deliuereth the worde, and ſacraments, to thoſe that are well prepared woorthily to receiue the ſame, hurteth himſelf only, though he periſh, they may be ſaued, they receiuing it woorthily, his vnwoorthines doth not preiudice them,  S. 152. P. 74.
               It greeueth our God greatly, to ſee man make ſo little account of his ſoule, and ſo lightly to regarde that, which he hath loued ſo deerly, he cannot abide to ſee it beſet with wicked thoughts, on euerie ſide,  S 153. P. 74. and 75.
               To dwell among prophane and wicked men, and yet ſtill to be conſtant, in thy faith and religion, is an euident argument of Gods

ſpirit dwelling in thee, and preſeruing thee from all the cunning and ſleights of ſathan: for as a looking glaſſe is made foule with the breth of thoſe that blowe vpon it, ſo oftentimes good men are corrupted with euill companie,  S. 154. P. 75. &amp; 76.
               Sathan doth ſpread, and lay abroad, moſt dangerous baites and ſnares, in the perſons of lewd and vngodly men, and all to trap vs, and to preiudice our ſaluation,  S. 155. P. 76.
               Wicked and graceleſſe men, cannot ſee this world, nor the ſleights and deceits of the ſame, bicauſe there is no diſtance betweene the world and themſelues. For the eie it ſelfe, cannot ſee a thing, vnleſſe there be ſome diſtance, betweene the eie and the obiect that is to be ſeene,  S. 156. P. 76.
               There is no maner of ſinne (as it is ſinne) that can offend the wicked and vngodly ſort, diſpleaſe it God neuer ſo greatly, in the middeſt of Babylon they ſee it not, in the middeſt of Sodom, they feele not the ſtinch of it. As they be in the world, ſo they be of it, and the world it ſelfe, and therefore they loue and imbrace it: they cannot, they wil not ſpie any faults in the world, the ſtinch of the world, is to them a ſweete ſauour, the foulnes of it, to them is beautie it ſelfe,  S. 157. P. 76. &amp; 77.
               A flatterer is a wilde beaſt, an vncleane diuell, a ſorcerer, a witch, a theefe: and no theefe in the world vnwoorthier to liue, than he. He that doth diſpraiſe thee, and he that doth flatter thee, bee both perſecutors of thee, but the flatterers tong wil do thee moſt harm. Flatterie is a ſweete muſicke to a mans 
                     •
                  ares, but in deede, there is none more pernicious and peſtilent than it,  S. 158. P. 77.
               The flatterer hath alwaies at his fingers ends, and readie vnder his girdle, the geſtures, voices, inclinations and diſpoſitions, of all perſons, high and lowe. Say what thou wilt, and do what thou wilt, he will pleaſe thy humor in all things,  S. 159. P. 78.
               Though the bloodie minded Papiſts, do want power and opportunitie, yet they neuer want good will, to performe their trecherie and malice, againſt the ſeruants of God, with all tyrannicall crueltie,  S. 160. P. 79.
               Where the skin of a lion is not ynough, nor will not ſerue, it is woont to be peeced, with the skin of a foxe: that which a cruell man, cannot accompliſh by force, he wil performe it by fraud,  S. 161. P. 79.
               An olde foxe is hardly ſnared: and yet at the length, they be either ſnared for their conuerſion, or knared for their confuſion. Hypocrites and arrogant perſons, do neuer follow Chriſt,  S. 161. P. 80.
               An hypocrite is like an apple that is verie beautifull without, and rotten within: and like a goodly tall tree, that floriſheth, and is full of leaues, but fruitleſſe: he would ſeeme to be that he is not, and hateth to be that he ſeemeth,  S. 162. P. 80.
               If thou loue to be fed with flatterie, then thou wilt feede thy flatterers, and they at the length, will ſerue thee, as Acteons dogs ſerued him. The flattered ſhall be deuoured of his dog the flatterer, and the flatterer himſelfe ſhal be deuoured of that foule curre, and moſt cruell hell hound ſathan,  S. 163. P. 81.
               It is a very hard thing, for a man to giue ouer his acquaintance with the world. A childe will loue his nurſe, for the dugs ſake, though ſhe be an whoore: and men loue this preſent world, for the vaine pleaſures, and carnall delights of the ſame, though indeede, the world be a very ſtrumpet,  S. 164 Pag. 81. and 82.
               If men would euen ſteale, as it were, and priuily conuey themſelues, but one hower in euerie day, from the ſeruice of the worlde, fleſh, and diuell, to ſerue the Lord, in truth and ſinceritie, they woulde at the length, by little and little, take ſuch pleaſure, and finde ſuch comfort, in the ſeruice of God, that they would giue themſelues wholy, and moſt willingly to it, and be

               Vicious liuing is more oftenſiue, and doth more harme, in old age, than in green youth. An olde man or woman, ought to inſtruct others, as well by good example, of godlie life, as by counſels and admonitions, but

when old men or women, fall to follie, they hurt themſelues with their ſinnes, and infinite others, with their euill example,  S. 165. Pag. 82.
               The Lord doth not open, the myſteries and ſecrets of his word, vnto thoſe, whom he perceiueth vainly and curiouſly to ſeeke after them, but vnto ſuch as will both profite themſelues, and others by the ſame. He that will profit by hearing or reading the word of God, muſt bring faith and humilitie with him,  S. 166. P. 82. and 83.
               Many men in the world, are fitly compared, to the drie skin, which a ſnake doth caſt, to renew hir a

                  e, the skin hath the ſhape, likenes, and prints of eies, and the very rinde alſo, wherewith the eie is couered, but yet no ſeeing eies: So many men, haue eies to ſee the creatures of God, but not one halfe eie, to ſee the creator. And manie that beare the name of chriſtians, haue no more true knowledge of Chriſt, than they had of the ſunne or moone, when they were yet in their mothers wombes. So that, when they read, or heare the word of God, they profit no more, than a blinde man ſhould profit, by a looking glaſſe ſet before him,  S. 167. P. 83. and 84.
               Some do come to church, to heare the word of God, to the end they may know him, and his will to do it, and do beare away with them ſuch heauenly leſſons, as they neuer forget, wherewith their faith is ſtrengthened, their ſoules comforted, and their conſciences greatly quieted: ſome againe do come, in hope to heare, ſome thing fall from the preachers mouth, vnwiſely, vndiſcr

               Afflictions, troubles, and calamities, are great helpes, to keepe our ſoules from the canker, and rottennes of ſinne, and the ſpots of the world, and to put vs in remembrance, of the goodnes, mercies, and loue of God toward vs. Men are borne, vnder that condition, that their liues ſhould euer be open, and ſubiect, to all the ineuitable darts, of infinite troubles, and that there is no refuſing, to liue, and leade their liues, in that condition, where vnder they were borne. Come what ſhall, the children of God, are ſtill patient.  S. 169 P. 85. 86. and 87.
               Darknes and blindnes, cannot remaine in the hart of that man, which the holy Ghoſt, the author of all light, and the onely light it ſelfe, hath choſen to be his owne ſeate, and holy habitation: Error cannot flowe from the fountaine of wiſdome, neither is it poſſible, that a line of wickednes ſhould be drawne, from the one a centre of all goodnes: the fruits of death, cannot growe out of the tree of life, theſe are vnpoſſible things. And on the other ſide, where the holy ſpirit of grace, and might, hath not place and poſſeſſion, there is no good thing to be found, bicauſe the author of goodnes is not there,  S. 170. P. 87. and 88.
               Calamitie patiently borne doth availe very much, for the aduancing of the praiſe of true vertue, and vnfained holines,  S. 171. P. 88
               It is mans onely ſafetie, to keepe himſelfe neare vnto God, for when he ſhaketh off the gouernment of Gods word, and with his ſins and iniquities, diuideth himſelfe from the Lord, then commeth his danger, he cannot but fall into the hands of ſathan, hell, and deſtruction,  S. 172. P. 88.
               Sorrowes, troubles, afflictions, and vexations, are in the children of God, the armour and badges of Chriſt,  S. 173. P. 89.
               Howſoeuer God dealeth with men, yet he is all one, there is no change, nor any ſhadow of change in him, the change is in our ſelues, not in the Lord. When we liuing in his feare, faith and loue, do inioy the light of his countenance, his bleſſing, ſpirituall and temporal: if at any time he turne his face from vs, and ſhall take away the comforts of our ſoules &amp; bodies, it is bicauſe we are changed, not he,  S. 174. P. 89.
               Man muſt be verie carefull, and haue in himſelfe, at the leaſt a deſire, that ſomething may be in him, to mooue the Lord to grant

that vnto him, that he craueth, or looketh for at his hand: as if he will haue the Lord to be mercifull, he muſt vſe mercy towards others: if he would haue him to be a good father to him, he muſt ſhew himſelf an obedient child, &amp;c.  S. 175. P. 89. 90. 91.

               Though a man be neuer ſo barren, bad, &amp; without any good thing in him, yet if the word of the Lord, once take hold of his hart, and finde any rooting there, it will draw him by degrees, to the nature of it ſelfe, and make him very fruitfull,  S. 176. P. 91.
               A man may boldly inueigh againſt the ſinnes of others, when he hath amended his owne amiſſes, and very likely he ſhall be ſalt to others, when himſelfe is ſeaſoned,  S. 177. P. 92.

               When princes will haue godly, vertuous, loyall, and obedient ſubiects, they muſt vſe them as Iacob did his ſheepe, they may laie before them the rod of true religion, iuſtice, holines, righteouſnes, and integritie of life, that by the ſight of thoſe things, they may conceiue good things, and bring foorth fruit of that colour.

               Riches, as gold, money, and ſuch like, laide vp in cheſtes, and lockt vp in cofers, are in danger to be loſt, through theeues, fire, or other meanes, but being diſperſed and ſcattered among the poore, they are in ſafetie, and will bring foorth much fruit, and will be

               In the miniſters of the word, true doctrine and godly life muſt go togither. He that teacheth good things to others, and teacheth not himſelf to do them, is like a ſieue or boulter, wherewith meale is ſifted or boulted, which ſendeth foorth the fineſt floure, and beſt of the wheat, and keepeth the bran, and woorſt of the wheate, to it ſelfe,  S. 105.

               The tyrannie and crueltie of princes, towards their loyall ſubiects, doth threaten the ruine of their kingdomes: but lenitie &amp; mercie, doth make their kingdomes mightilie to floriſh, and brings peace and ſafetie to themſelues. Mercy becommeth a chriſtian prince verie well. Mercy and truth haue kept, &amp; do keepe Elizabeth our gratious Queene of England, and elemencie doth ſtrengthen hir throne. Mercy doth lift man vp to Godward, but crueltie doth caſt man downe to hell warde,  S. 206. P. 114 115.
               Ingratitude is a greeuous ſinne, wherwith the Lord hath euer beene highly offended, the Lords hand hath euer beene ſtretched out againſt it. England hath receiued great &amp; infinite benefits both for their bodies and ſouls, but England is far behind, with thanks giuing vnto the Lord, wherefore we muſt be either more thankfull, or elſe looke aſſuredly for more puniſhment.

               Enuie is not bred, in the harts of vertuous and godly men, but in the harts and minds of the wicked and vngodly. Enuie will not be tamed, a man may ouercome and ſubdue his enimies, but not their enuie. Enuie doth teare and rende in peeces the man in whom it is. The enuious man doth make the felicitie of another man, his owne torment,  S. 208. P. 117.
               The Lord will haue his ſeruants tried in this world with many afflictions, to the ende, that the difference which is betweene them, and the children of this world, may appeere and be euident, and that vertue may growe to perfection in them. A chriſtian man may be a martyr and euen liuing, without loſing his life by fire or ſword,  S. 209. P. 117. 118. 119.
               Words of doctrine are verie profitable, but when they are ſeene, to worke holines and righteouſnes in the teachers, they then preuaile the more, with them that are taught,  S. 210. P. 119. 120.
