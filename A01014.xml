            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            Doctor FLVDDS Answer vnto M. FOSTER OR, THE SQVESING OF Parson FOSTERS SPONGE, ordained by him for the wiping away of the WEAPON-SALVE.
            
            VVherein the Sponge-bearers immodest carriage and behauiour towards his bretheren is detected; the bitter flames of his slanderous reports, are by the sharpe vineger of Truth corrected and quite extinguished: and lastly, the vertuous validity of his Sponge, in wiping away of the Weapon-Salue, is crushed out and cleane abolished.
            Bilis acutissima aceto correcta acerrimo redditur dulcior.
            PSAL. 92.7.
            Opera Dei, vir brutus &amp; stultus non intelligit.
            The Assertion of Parson Foster and his Faction or Cabale, is this:
            The wonderfull manner of healing by the weapen-salue, is diaholicall, or effected onely by the inuention and power of the Deuill;
            But, the royall Psalmist guided by the spirit of God, saith:
            
               Psal. 71.18. 
               
                  Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who only worketh wonders! Therefore, The Prophet pointeth thus, at these and such like enemies of the Truth.
            
            
               
                  Esa. 5.20.
               
                Woe vnto them that speake good of euill, and euill of good; which put darknesse for light, and light for darknesse; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter; Woe vnto them that are wise in their owne eyes, and prudent in their owne sight.

               1. Taketh away and vtterly disannulleth those scandalous reports which Master Foster hath in his writing most falsly and irreligiously diuulged and layd vnto my charge, and withall expresseth vnto the world, how vnseemely a thing it is, for a man of his calling to accuse and censure his brother vniustly.
               
                  
                     2. Is diuided into 3 Partes or Chapters: of the which the
                     One, doth answer particularly vnto euery obiection, that Master Foster doth make in a generality for the abolishing of the Weapon-Salues vsage:
                     Other, doth maintaine Theologically the Cure of the Weapon-Salue, to be good and lawfull, and proueth it by the authority of holy Writ, to be the Gift of God; and not of the Diuell.
                     Lastly, demonstrateth the mystery of the weapon-salues cure, by a Theophilosophicall discourse, and sheweth how it is grafted or planted by God in the Treasury of Nature.
                  
               
               Last, doth answer vnto each particular obiection, which our Spongy Aduersary maketh against acertaine Treatise, expressed by mee in my mysticall Anatomy, for the prouing and maintaining of the cure by the weapon-Salue to be naturall; and no way Cacomagicall.

            TO THE WELL MINDED and vnpartiall READER.
            
            
               I Did not thinke (Courteous and learned Reader) to haue stirred vp the puddle of this mine Aduersaries turbulent Spirit, for a 3. fold reason, whereof the first is his insufficiencie to vndergoe a taske of so high a nature and so farre beyond his reach or capacity, namely; to diue into this profound Mystery of curing by the weapon-salue: and then because my learned friends, obseruing his inclination vnto immorality and malice (as appearing indeed more skilfull to Cauill and calumniat, then to decide with grauity so weighty a controuersy) gaue mee counsell to haue patience and to answer such a manner of man with Silence: and lastly, by reason of that reverence which I beare vnto his vocation, namely; as he is a minister

of Gods word, professing vnto the world that I would endure much rather then to haue the least opposition with any of that profession. But since I haue perceiued his indiscreete importunity to extend it selfe so farre as to vrge me beyond the bounds of patience by setting vp in the night time two of the frontispices or Titles of his booke, as a Challenge, one each post of my doore, and vnderstanding of his many other vndecent actions, as well by heare say, as in his publick writing, wherein hee hath in a Scornefull and opprobrious manner laied disgracefull matters vnto my charge: I haue beene forced, against my will, to take the person (set
               
                  •…
               ing with my best respect aside the Parson and his habit) into my better consideration, and to examine in this my small Pamphlet the misdemeanours of his Booke entituled; The Sponge to wipe away the Weapon-Salue expressed both in his erroneous doctrine touching the maine subiect of that manner of curing, as also his rude and vnseemely carriage towards his bretheren, that thereby I may as well cleare my selfe from such immodest and vniust imputations, which with an euill Conscience he hath

laied vpon me, as also expresfe the Shallownesse of the person in this busines, which hee so vaine gloriously hath vndertaken.
            I doubt not but as there are many who in euery degree can discerne an euident difference between this satyrical gentleman &amp; my selfe, so because I know that there are diuers of the common sort of people, who in their zeale without vnderstanding are apter to conceiue and iudge amisse, then in their charity to ponder the truth of the businesse; I am the willinger to cope with this vnsauory Philosopher, whom I finde (and I make no doubt, shall proue) fuller of windy verbosity then of solide Philosophy, or any thing else that is grounded vpon firme reason.
            What shall I say vnto the man, whom, vnto my best remembrance, I neuer saw nor knew, saue onely by a bragging smoake of rumour, which pronounced me a farre off an Anathema? The thunder which long smoothered in the gloomy Cloud of report, is now broke forth the flame of his lightning affaileth mee: What then is more conuenient and requisite then sharpe vineger to quench it? yea, he shall find it so acute &amp; peircing (though not with rayling and calumniating

edge, according vnto his bitter custome, but reseruing it selfe within the bounds of Christian modesty) that his Sponge shall not bee able to drinke it vp or wipe it away. It shall quell the vnsatiable appetite of his Salue-deuouring Sponge, and squeeze or crush it so, that it shall be constrained to vomit vp againe that wholesome Child of nature and gentle friend vnto mankind (I meane the weapon-salue) which it hath drunk or sucked vp, and leaue it in it's wonted Splendor and reputation amongst men. And lastly, it shall examine the quintessence of the Sponge-bearers selfe-conceited wit, and tell him, that what somtimes appeareth great, is not alwaies the same it seemeth, but rather a shaddow or blast of empty ayre. This is all (iudicious Reader) that I wil say at this time, as for the rest, I refer it to the proofe in the pondering wherof I most heartily pray you that all partiality or peculiar affection being laied aside, you will be pleased faithfully to iudge of this our cont ouersie, and weigh euery passage thereof in the iust and equall ballance of your best discretion.

selfe, and better acceptance and satisfaction vnto my countrymen, I may proceed vnto the maine businesse or question which is proposed by this mine Adversary.
                  Vnto him therefore I must in the first place turne the edge of my pen and file of speech, for as much as he, forgetting that I am his Brother in Christ, and his Country-man, yea, and not differing from him in Religion, should so farre neglect the Precepts of the Prophet Dauid, our Sauiour Christ, his Spirituall Master, and his Apostolicall followers, as slande-rously and void of Christian modesty (most requisite vnto a person of his diuine calling) to publish vnto the world (although it were deseruedly, much lesse against the grounds of Truth and rules of Iustice) the weaknesse and imperfection of his Brother.
                  The Kingly Dauid therefore saith: Thou giuest thy 
                     Plalm. 49. 
                     mouth to euill, and with thy tongue thou forgest deceit, thou speakest against thy brother, and obiectest slander vnto him, therefore art thou in darkenesse because thou hatest thy brother; whereby the Psalmist doth in expresse tearmes argue, that the man who calumniates his brother, and accuseth him spightfully, is a childe of this world, an impe of darkenesse and not of God, the Creator of vs all.
                  This is also euidently expressed by the Apostle

                     enuying and strife is, there is sedition and all manner of euill workes: But the wisedome that is from aboue, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easie to be entreated, not iudging, and without hypocrisie, &amp;c. Heere the Apostle sheweth, that the bitterness of heart, and enuie, and lying against the Truth, is earthly, sensuall and diabolicall. Now I leaue it vnto your vpright consideration (vnpartiall Reader) to iudge whether this our brother bee not in his writing bitter against me and many other of his brethren (I will not say enuious and contentious) I pray God he be not prooued also a Lyer against the Truth, in holding this proposed question affirmatiuely: I feare that in the end it will prooue so: for Veritie her selfe, frowning at the action, is ready to enter the listes in her owne def

                  But perchance Master Foster will denie and renounce all brother-hood, that may be betweene vs: But he shall finde that these our Sauiour Christ his Words doe expresly confute such his Assertion: Fratrum vestrum quis

                     &amp; Conditor? Why doe euerie one of you despise his Brother, since there is but one Father and maker of all. And the Prophet speaking to the same purpose saith: Ab eadem Petra excisi estis: All of you are cut out of one and 
                     Isai, 51. 
                     the same Rocke.
                  
                  Thus farre I haue spoken with the mouth of the Prophets, our Sauiour, and his Apostles. But mine Aduersarie will reply and say, that Doctor Fludd is

a Magitian, and hath maintayned a damnable and diabolicall action, namely, the Curing by the Weapon-Salue to be good and lawfull, and therefore by warrant of Scripture he ought sharpely to be told of it, &amp;c. I answer, That from this obiection may arise a double question; whereof the first is, Whether the assertion of our aduersary be true or false? and then, whether it bee a brotherly part, first to diuulge it, though it were true indeede, vnto the eares of the people, before hee hath admonished his brother in priuate of his error. Touching the ground or scope of the first, namely, whether, according vnto his assertion, I am a Magitian or no, it shall bee fully discussed in the third Chapter of this present Member, where I make no doubt to proue to each welminded person (and that to the burthen of my rash accusers conscience, if he haue any) that he is iustly ranked and numbred amongst those, at whom the Prophet Dauid, our Sauiour CHRIST, and the Apostle Iames haue aymed in the places aboue mentioned. As for the second, our Lord IESVS resolveth it in these words: Si peccauerit in te frater tuus, vade &amp; corripe eum inter te &amp; ipsum solum; si te audiverit, 
                     Marth. 18.25. 
                     lucratus es fratrem tuum: If thy brother hath trespassed against thee, goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone: if he heare thee, thou hast wonne thy brother, &amp;c. whereby it is apparant, that mine Adversarie hath not dealt with mee as one Christian ought to deale with another, for as much as he hath violated the Precepts of his Master IESVS CHRIST in this point, and therefore this his misbehauiour can no way be excused.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. II.
                  
                     Here the Author answereth to some extrauagant passages which his Aduersarie doth, partly in his merry moode, and partly in a Calumniating manner, obiect against him.
                  
                  
                     MY reputation doth a little engage mee to answer certaine extrauagant passages, which our Sponge-bearing Author maketh against mee; As for Example.
                  Doctor Fludd (saith hee) hath writ in the defence of Foster p. 38;
                      the Weapon-Salue, well he may, he is called, by Franciscus Lanouius, Medico-miles, a Souldier-Physitian, and being a Weapon-bearing Doctor, may well teach the Weapon-curing medicine, especially setting the Armiger before the Doctor, the Gunne before the Gowne, the Pike before the Pen.
                  (Good Reader) obserue this vnreasonable iest; rather Fludd. than sit out, the Gentleman will picke strawes, or play with a feather. What? Not one word with reason, nor yet any Syllable in good Rime, but all vpon the Letters G. and P? An excellent argument of a simple wit.
                  But touching that which seemeth most materiall in this pretty discourse, I will answere with the like obiection vnto that of our conceited Master of Arts: He would seeme to teach mee that the Armiger or Esquier ought to be set before the Doctor being that there is a question, whether a Knight or

a Doctor should challenge the first place, and therefore (saith hee) the Esquier was ill placed before the Doctor, being that the Doctor is the better man; verily I thinke that it ought to be so, and yet neuerthelesse, it is certaine that now adayes a reasonable Esquier thinketh much to yeeld place vnto a Doctor: But this is not to our question. Hee seemes to accuse me because I say, Robertus Fluddus Armiger &amp; in Medicina Doctor: Robert Fludd Esquier and Doctor of Physicke. I will answere and pay him with his owne Coyne. Why doth hee put the Master of Arts before the Parson or Minister, being that the Minister is the better man, by reason of the Sanctitie of his Vocation. Hereupon it is that a Doctor of Diuinitie, though of a latter standing, taketh place of a Doctor of Physicke who had his degree before him. Againe, Why doth Master Foster in his Dedicatory Epistle put the Baron of Wing before the Viscount of Ascot, and the Viscount of Ascot before the Earle of Carnaruon? And lastly, why doth hee Pag. 38. terme me Master Doctor, setting the Master before the Doctor? Verily, our wise brother findes a mote in mine eye, but will not looke vpon the beame in his owne. And now I will expresse the cause, why I put the Esquier before the Doctor. It is for two considerations: first, because I was an Esquier, and gaue armes before I was a Doctor, as being a Knights sonne: next because, though a Doctor addeth gentilitie to the person, who by descent is ignoble; yet it is the opinion of most men, and especially of Heraulds, that a Gentleman of Antiquitie, is to be preferred before

any one of the first Head or Degree: And verily for mine owne part I had rather bee without any degree in Vniuersitie, than lose the honour was left me by my Ancestors. Thus farre I haue thought fit to satisfie the Gentleman in his humour, wondering at nothing more, than that he should leaue the maine matter, to snarle at my gentilitie. Would he thinke it decent in mee to revile him for his lownesse of birth or ignobilitie? For I know what he is: God forbid such an absurditie should come from my pen, much lesse to vpbraid him with his gentilitie, if hee were a Gentleman indeed.
                  In another place hee inueigheth bitterly against me in this manner:
                  The Doctor, who impiously attributeth composition vnto Foster p. 48.
                      God, dareth falsly to attribute corporalitie vnto Devils; the contrarie of which, that they haue no manner of bodies, is the tenent of the Church.
                  I see that our Master in Arts is scarce in this matter Fludd. his Arts master: hee talkes with Mersennus the Fryer his tongue, and therefore is but Mersennus his Parrat; wherefore as I haue answered him in Latine, so will I partly in the same sense satisfie this importunate Author in English; not with impious tearmes, according to his custome, but modestly. Mersennus maketh it an impietie in mee to say, that God filleth the heauenly Spirit of the World: whereupon hee concludes and saith, Facit proinde Deum compositionem cum hoc spiritu aethereo; hee therefore maketh God a composition with this aethereall spirit.
                     
My answere to him is this, that the incorruptible spirit of the Lord is in all things, as Salomon au
                        •…
                     rreth. And Saint Iohn saith; All things were made by the Word, and without it nothing was made; in it was life, &amp;c. And againe, Wisd. 12-1. 
                     Hee filleth the heauens and viuifieth all things. What? And must I therefore attribute composition vnto God, or doe I make God part of composition? No verily; forasmuch as God in his essence is indiuisible, and therefore hee cannot bee a part in composition; but hee is said to bee in all, and ouer all, as he is the Catholicke Actor of life, whereupon the Apostle teacheth vs, that hee viuifieth all things, and therefore hee is said to bee in the spirit of the world, and also without it, no diuision of his diuine Essence being made. So also it is said, that in God wee liue, moue, and haue our being: and yet God is not in vs as a part in composition, but as an eternall Actor in compositions; not mixed, but mingling the composition, in number, weight, and measure: that is, tempering and vniting euerie particle, as it were with the glew of perfect loue and harmonie. And to this purpose it is said in Iob, Sicut argillam fecisti me. Nonne sicut lac fudisti me, &amp; tanquam caseum coagulasti me, cute &amp; carne induisti me, ossibusque &amp; 
                     Iob. 10.9. 
                     neruis texisti me, cum vita benignitatem exercuisti erga me, &amp; visitatio tua conseruauit spiritum meum? whereby it is euident, that God is the compounder in mans composition, but not a part of it.
                  To conclude: I haue answered this point more at large in that Reply I made to Gassendus his Retection of my Philosophy, where I proue that the vertue of God is in euerie thing, as it composeth all

things. But if I had said that God entred into composition, was it so impious a thing, when the Scripture auerreth that the Word was incarnated? I am too long in prouing that, which Master Foster taketh barely out of the Fryers mouth, but knoweth not, what eyther he, or I meane thereby; as for the deuils corporalitie, I will proue it elsewhere.
               
               
                  CHAP. III.
                  
                     Wherein the Author is wrongfully accused, by his discourteous homebred Aduersary of Magicke, and afterwards by his forren opposites, though of a contrary Religion, is excused and cleared from that crime.
                  
                  
                     IT is no maruaile, though mine Aduersarie doth rashly and vniustly wound a mans Reputation, who differeth from him in Profession or Vocation, being that his Satyricall or Cynicke passion will not spare such learned men, as are of his owne calling or habit: for if you will bee pleased to read and obserue his Dedicatorie Epistle, you shall finde there, that hee (partly, as it seemeth, being moued thereto by En
                     
                        •…
                     ie at such as are in a better way of preferment than himselfe, and partly to insinuate and beget a better opinion and liking in his Patron) inueigheth in these verie words against some of his owne Coate; nor am I (saith hee) of their minde, which to become great by being accounted good Preachers, preach not aboue twice, or thrice a yeare, and then lay all their strength
                     
on their Sermon; my resolution is otherwise, I will read much, write somewhat, and preach often.
                  Loe, how hee condemneth others, and prayseth himselfe; yea, hee doth not sticke in his Epistle to the Reader, to snarle against his Superiours in the Church, because they doe not stop his mouth with a good Benefice or Church-liuing, considering his great deserts: yea, and seeme to calumniate them, and lay Simony vnto their charges, his words are these:
                  Shall any man for my boldnesse thinke to sit vpon my skirts? Let those know, I esteeme my selfe infra inuidiam, I cannot haue lesse in the Church, vnlesse nothing; and if they shall endeauour to keepe me still low, let them know I looke for no good from them, that enuy at my end
                        •…
                     auours to doe good: if I sit panting on the ground, I will not refuse to be fed with Rauens to keepe me aliue with Elias, but I looke not to be lifted vp by any, but by Eagles; Heroicke spirits, Men fearing God and hating Simoniacall couetoustnesse.
                  He scorneth to be raysed by his Superiours in the Church, and expects onely to bee raysed by Eagles, Heroicke Spirits, namely, by such as his noble Patron is, in whom is no Simoniacall couetousnesse, as who should say, that in others there is Simonia-call couetousnesse, &amp;c. What therefore can I expect from his outragious pen, bnt slanders of witch-craft, Magicke, and such like abominations? What lesse can I appeare in his sight than an anathema, one (I say) abandoned and accursed vnto the Deuill. His scandalous texts are these:
                  Doctor Fludd hath had the same censure passed on him, 
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                     
                     
and hath beene writ against for a Magitian, and I suppose this to be one cause, why hee hath printed his Booke beyond the Seas: Our Vniuersitie and Bishops are more cautelous (God bee thanked) than to allow the printing of Magicall Bookes here.
                  Surely, D. Fludds very defence of the Weapon-Salue Againe is enough to make it suspected, himselfe being accused for 2. Pag. 38. a Magitian by Marinus Mersennus, with a wonder that King IAMES (of blessed memory) would suffer such a man to liue and write in his Kingdome. But if to bee accused were to bee guiltie, who could bee innocent? Master Doctor hath excused hims

                  Heere (Gentle Reader) you may see him pull off Fludd. his hood of simplicitie or feined veile of sanctitie, which hee professed in his Epistles, and discouer 
                        •…
                     he malice and enuy of his heart against me: In the first place therefore, for the better satisfaction of my Country-men and friends, I will expresse the cause, why I touched the superstitious Magia, or Magicke of the ancient Ethnickes. My scope was and ha
                        •…
                     h beene to write aswell the naturall discourse of the great world and little world, which wee call Man, as also to touch by way of an Encyclophy or Epitome all Arts, aswell lawfull, which I did commend, as those which are esteemed vnlawfull, which I did vtterly condemne, as superstitious and of little or no probabilitie at all; among the rest where I came to speake of the Arts, which belong vnto the little world or Man; I mention the Science of Genethlialogie, which treateth of the Iudgement of Natiuities,

wherin I produce the great dispute which did arise betweene the two famous Philosophers Porphyrie and Iamblicus, whereof the first did hold that a man might come to the knowledge of his owne Genius or good Angell by the Art of Astrologie, namely, by finding out the Planet and Nature of his spirit, that was Lord of the eleuenth house, the which by the Astrologians was for that cause called Bonus Daemon or the good Angell. But Iamblicus his opinion was, that a man had neede of the Assistance and Knowledge of a higher Spirit, than was any of those which were Gouernours of Fatalitie, namely, of such Intelligences as were ascribed to the rule and direction of the seuen Planets: wherefore I did thereupon expresse the superstition of the Ancients with the Impossibilitie thereof, that thereby I might the better descry it &amp; make it the more ridiculous to wise men. I then suspecting the captious Natures of some enuious persons, did there make an Apologie, to excuse my selfe and to shew the vanitie of the thing, and how full of idle superstition it was, and to shew it to bee onely Imaginarie. But I seemed there to consent with Iamblicus, auerring with him, that without the Reuelation of that high and heauenly Spirit, which was granted vnto the Elect, none could come to the familiaritie or knowledge of his good Angell. I proue it out of many places of Scripture: Loe, this is all! Now iudge (all yee that are vnpartiall and truely learned) what an offence was here to decide according vnto my power, that great Controuersie of these two notable and eminent

Philosophers, which hath stucke and beene vndecided euen vnto this day, being that I in the conclusion ascribed the whole Glorie vnto that sole and onely Spirit, which is the Prince and Lord of Angels and Spirits: I professed to write generally of all, but as I went along, I distinguished the good from the euill, that men might the better beware of, and refuse the one, and make choyce of the other. Now therefore, that I haue expressed vnto you the ground, why this our Criticke and his CynickeMaster the Fryer Mersennus haue slandered me with the Title of a Magitian: I will proceed to the answer of euery member of his friuolous obiections.
                  Doctor Fludds defence of the Weapon-salue is enough Foster. to make it suspected.
                  And why I pray you? Fludd.
                  
                  Marry because he himselfe is accused for a magitian by Foster. Marinus Mersennus.
                  The conclusion is much like the capacitie of the Fludd. concluder: Doctor Fludd is suspected for a Magitian: Ergo the purge of Rubarbe which he prescribeth, or rather any point in Philosophie or Physicke, by him maintained in writings, is Magicall. Non sequitur argumentum: So Roger Bacon is accused for a Conjurer, and a Magitian Ergo the Perspectiue or Opticke Science, hee writeth of, is deuilish and Magicall, or at least wise to be suspected.
                  I but this Salue hath a Caco-magicall propertie in it, Foster. for it healeth a farre off, and not per contactum.
                  
                  So doth Bacons Opticke make vs to see the Images Flud. of liue men to walke in the Ayre, and it is said,

that by his Art he made an Apparition of a man to walke from the top of Alhollows steeple in Oxford, to the top of S. Maries: Surely these Opticall conclusions must be Magicall, and not by naturall reflection of glasses, because these are vtterly vnknowne to M. Foster and his adherents, and consequently are to bee condemned as diabolicall. But to come to the purpose; M. Foster if his eies had beene so fauourable, and his will so charitable, as to haue looked on my answer to Mersennus in the defence of that point, before hee had iudged, he would without doubt, aswell as hundreds of other men, whereof some are Church-men, of no meane ranke, and many Doctors of Physicke of excellent learning, haue auerred, that D. Flud had answered Mersennus so fully, aswell in that accusation, as all other points layd by him vnto his charge, that he could not bee able any way to reply against it. And it is well knowne heere in England to such as haue beene conuersant beyond the Seas, that the sufficiencie of my answer hath so satisfied the learned, aswell in Germany as in France, that hee hath beene by them much condemned for his slanderous writing, and esteemed of but meanely for his small learning and indiscretion. Now the ground of his malice vnto me was, for that hee hauing written of the Harmony of the World, and finding that a Booke of that subiect set out by mee, was verie acceptable to his Countrey-men, hee inuented this slander against me and my Harmonie, that thereby hee might bring his owne into the better reputation. But what did I say? That hee was accused and condemned for that his slander by some in France, yea, verily his dearest

                     companion, who by reason of his insufficiencie, was easily perswaded to take his cause in hand, and to answer for him, I meane Peter Gassendus, his friend and Champion, chideth his Mersennus, for such his vncivill and scandalous reports against me in these verie words: Ac Zelus quidem quo tu Mersenne euectus es Gassendus fol. 9. commendari cum debeat, attamen telatere non potest, quin admodum durum sit viuenti in Christiano orbe appellari Cacomagum, Haeretico-magum, foetidae, &amp; horrendae Magiae Doctorem, &amp; propagatorem, audire, non esse ferendum huiusmodi Doctorem impunè, prouocato Principe, vti de illo poenas sumat, minisque etiam adhibitis, eundem propterea breui submergendum fluctibus aeternis, &amp;c. vt nihil dicam de Atheismo atque haeresi quam tu quoqne obijcis Fluddo. Haec nempe sunt, quae Rufini, aut D. Hieronymi irritare patientiam potuissent. Alter enim cum patientiam requirat in caeteris: qui vel tamen vnius Haereseos crimen ferat, aut dissimulet, hunc clamitat non esse Christianum; Alter verò, nolo (inquit) nolo in suspitione Haeresios quenquam esse patientem. Quid fecissent in crimine, seu suspitione, aut Atheismi, aut Cacomagiae?
                  
                     These are the very words of Mersennus his chiefe friend, which I interpret thus: And although (my Mersennus) the zeale wherewith you are moued against Fludd is to bee commended, neuerthelesse you cannot bee ignorant, how grieuous and intolerable a thing it is vnto any man that liueth in the Christian world, to be called a Witch, or euill Magitian, a Hereticke-Magitian, or a teacher, or divulger of foule and horrible Magicke: and that such a teacher is not to bee suffered vnpunished, also to prouoke the King or Prince to punish him, and besides all this to threaten him; saying, that for that cause hee

should bee drowned or drenched in the eternall, Lake and so forth. Besides the Atheisme and Heresie, which also you obiect and lay to Fludds charge. Verily, these are things which would stirre vp the patience of Ruffinus or S. 
                           •…
                        erome, whereof the one when hee requireth patience in other things, yet hee concludeth, that hee which can beare or dissemble with the offence of one heresie, he crieth that such a man is no Christian: The other saith, I will not that any man should bee patient in the suspition of Heresie; much lesse to be accused or suspected of Atheisme or naughty magicke.
                  In which words our English world may discerne first, how this my honest dealing and morall forren Aduersarie doth checke his vnciuill friend, whose part hee vndergoeth, for his immodestie and small discretion: and next doth teach my home-bred Aduersarie a great deale of manners or behauiour in writing against an Aduersarie; namely, not to contend with foule and scandalous language, but with acute arguments, and those to the purpose, armed with the truest reasons of Philosophie: Doth not Master Foster blush now to see his mightie and magnanimous Author Marinus Mersennus checked by his judicious friend, whom hee himselfe hath elected, aswell for Vmpeere as Stickler in his cause? Yea, and a chiefe Champion to defend it, for calling me vniustly a Magitian and other misbeseeming names? Yea, is hee not ashamed, if hee hath any, to choose out a lying and false Author for the propagating of his Brothers slander? If this be not so, aske Gassendus.
                  
                  But hee will no doubt reply, that this speech of

                     Gassendus to Mersennus doth not take away for all that the suspition of Magicke from Doctor Fludd, though hee reproueth his friend for vsing him with so rough tearmes: To which, for his better satisfaction, I produce this other place out of Gassendus his Reply against me, in his friend Mersennus his behalfe:
                  
                     This is the Title of his Chapter, Gassendus fol. 144.
                         being the 20.
                     
                     Adlibri tertij Caput primum. Depulsa Fluddo Atheismi, Haeresios, &amp; praesertim Cacomagiae suspicio: (that is) To the first Chapter of the third Booke, wherein Fludd is cleared from the suspition of Atheisme, Heresie, and especially of Deuillish Magicke.
                     He speaketh thus by way of Counsell to Mersennus.
                     
                     Restat suspicio Cacomagiae, de qua praesertim quaestio haec est, veruntamen non vti ipsum Diabolicis illis artibus, argumento mihi est, quod Diabolos esse non credit (aut non videatur credere) quales nos vulgo intelligimus à Cacomagis vsurpari. (that is) There resteth now the suspition of Euill-magicke, of which especially the question is made, but this is an euident argument vnto mee, that hee is no such Magitian, because hee doth not beleeue (or at least wise maketh semblance not to beleeue) that there are such Deuils as wee imagine to bee familiar with Witches.
                  
                  Let Master Foster therefore see, vpon what ficke foundation hee hath layd the false and malignant slander of an Euill-Magitian on mee. But alas! I smell a Rat (for I will vse his owne wittie phrase)

he careth not how he may disgrace any one, so that he might thereby the better serue his owne turne. Because I haue produced in my Mysticall Anatomy a naturall reason for the Weapon-Salue, which hee neyther can, nor, for all his poore reasons expressed in his Booke, shall be able to refell, therefore, forsooth, I must be numbred amongst the Magitians. And wherefore? Marry because Mersennus hath giuen the same censure on me. And who is Mersennus? A rayling Satyricall Babler, not able to make a reply in his owne defence, and therefore being put to a Non plus, hee went like a second Iob in his greatest vexation to aske Counsell of the learnedst Doctors in Paris: And at last for all that, he fearing his cause, and finding himselfe insufficient, procured by much Intreatie his friend Peter Gassendus to helpe him, and called another of his friends vnto his assistance; namely, one Doctor Lanouius a seminarie Priest, as immorall as himselfe, and one that professeth in his Iudiciary Letter much, but performeth little. And in good faith, I may boldly say, that for three roaring, bragging, and fresh-water Pseudophilosophers, I cannot paralell any in Europe, that are so like of a condition, as are Mersennus, Lanouius, and Foster: all three exceeding terrible in their bumbasting words, imagining to quell and make subiect vnto their thundering braues the stoutest Schollers of Europe, if they cared for them, and did esteeme them more than Bugbeares to skare away Crowes or frighten little Children. As for Peter Gassendus I finde him a good Philosopher, and an honest and well conditioned Gentleman, iust aswell vnto his

Aduersary as friend, not passing beyond the bounds of Christian modestie, but striking home with his Philosophicall arguments, when hee seeth his occasion.
                  
                     Mersennus his words in his Epistle to his Patron (wherein hee seeketh ayde of this his friend Peter Gassendus) are these, translated in English as neere as I can.
                  After I had communicated with the Counsell of all my learned friends, they being heard, I would also aske counsell of my friend Gassendus, who departed into Germany a while since, I did pray and beseech him, that hee would seriously write backe vnto mee, what hee thought of Fludds workes: for I did coniecture that hee by reason of the curiositie, which hee had to attaine vnto euerie kinde of Philosophie, would for a certaine penetrate also into this Philosophie, vnder which, Fludd doth hide his impieties, &amp;c. Thus you see, that this good Fryer confesseth that hee vnderstood not Fludds Philosophie, and therefore was faine to pray Gassendus to assist him, which when Gassendus to his power had performed, with vnspeakable ioy hee vttereth these words:
                  
                  Behold, when Fludd in answering mee would hide himselfe vnder senses of Scripture, as lurking holes; my Gassendus hath so brought him out of them, and so discouered his Cabal, that I thinke my selfe satisfied with this discouery onely.
                  See here Master Foster, the crauenly &amp; cowardly Fryer, whom you take for your Author and Master: And well you may, for like Master, like scholler.

Iudge you therefore (worthy Reader) whether this mans slanderous reports bee not propped vp with a sound piece of flesh. A worthy Philosopher to challenge the field, and request other men to fight for him. As for Lanouius, he acknowledgeth that Mersennus hath earnestly sought his assistance also in these words:

                        I cannot but approue your counsell in taking the Iudgement of other men, which is, that you should not rashly precipitate your selfe in your owne cause; you haue also esteemed mee to bee fitly numbred amongst those which you haue made choyce of for this businesse.

                     rsennus (saith Master Foster) doth wonder, that King IAMES of blessed memorie would suffer such a man to liue and write in his Kingdome.
                  
                     
To this I answer that King Iames of euerlasting memorie for his Iustice, Pietie, and great Learning, was by some Enuious persons moued against mee, touching the same subiect; but when I came vnto him, and hee in his great wisedome had examined the truth and circumstance of euery point, touching this scandalous report, which irregularly and vntruly was related of mee, hee found me so cleare in my answer, and I him so regally learned and gracious in himselfe, and so excellent and subtill in his inquisitiue Obiections, aswell touching other points as this, that in stead of a checke (I thanke my God) I had much grace and honour from him, and receiued from that time forward many gracious fauours of him: And I found him my iust and kingly Patron all the dayes of his life. And must I now after so regall a Iudge haue such an vpstart Inquisitor as is Master Foster, to Iudge and censure mee againe, and that by the ridiculous authoritie of an ignorant Fryer, whose friend doth iustly condemne him, and checke him for his slanders, and cleare mee from all such crimes as he obiecteth against me?
                  
                     Then he makes a very shrewd obiection, saying, Because Mersennus writ against Doctor Fludd for a Magitian, therefore I suppose that this is the cause, why he hath printed his Bookes beyond the Seas, our Vniuersitie and reuerend Bishops, &amp;c: as before.
                  
                  Though I need not answer, in this point, a man of Fludd. so enuious a condition; yet, for Charities sake, which bids me not offend my brother, I will at this time satisfie him. I sent them beyond the Seas, because our home-borne Printers demanded of me fiue

hundred pounds to Print the first Volume, and to find the cuts in copper; but beyond the Seas it was printed at no cost of mine, and that as I would wish: And I had 16. coppies sent me ouer with 40. pounds in Gold, as an vnexpected gratuitie for it. How now Master Foster, haue I not made you a lawfull answer? As for the Vniuersitie: I wonder my workes should seeme so male-gracious vnto it, when they are registred in two of her Libraries. And surely, if my conscience had perswaded mee, that there had beene any thing in them, which had beene so haynous or displeasant, eyther to the Kings Maiestie, or the Reuerend Bishops, I would not haue presumed, to haue made first our late King Iames of blessed memorie, and next three of the Reuerend Bishops of the Land the Patrons of them; being that I, electing them my Patrons, must present them with the first fruits, and therefore must know, that if any thing had happened amisse in them, it could not bee hidden from them, whom in veritie I would bee afraid to displease, as being such as with my heart I reuerence.

of Gassendus his Booke, To make Master Fosters worship an account I am not minded at this time, onely thus much I will say for Ioachimus Frisius, that what he hath produced out of their owne workes, in their owne defence, excuseth them, and accuseth such calumniatours as Master Foster is, who are so apt to condemne a person for that they are altogether ignorant in: Let the Readers obserue the proofes in Frisius his Booke to cleare them; and then if any will afterwards accuse them, I shall deeme them partiall. But wee must note by the way, that our Sponge-bearer must make election of Iesuites (as in his Epistle hee confesseth) and Fryers and Seminarie Priests to bee his instructors and teachers, to reply both against the Weapon-Salue and mee, when hee knoweth that they are such as can affoord neyther him nor me (as being esteemed among them for Heretickes) one good word. Nay, I will tell him for his greater shame, that their onely spight vnto me is, because they discerne my workes to bee well esteemed abroad in the world, my selfe being (as exorbitant vnto their Church) esteemed by them an hereticke. All that the greatest Aduersary I haue, euen Marinus Mersennus himselfe aymeth at, is to haue me change my Religion, &amp; to gaine me to their side, &amp; for that intent he promiseth me, if I will leaue my Heresie (as he termeth it) many rewards &amp; courtesies. But I finde here at home euen amongst our owne Religion, some men lesse friendly and greater enemies vnto me and mine honest endeauours than abroad. Mersennus his words are these, after hee had thought with great tearmes to terrifie mee.

                  Marry I will tell him why, If it had been true that Fludd. thevse of the Weapon-salue is witchcraft, and the vsers thereof Witches and Coniurers, (as he boldly saith) how I pray you should Belzebub bee missing from our company? But being that it appeareth false before God and man, it should seeme he was busie in the animating of his Ministers; namely of those calum-niators &amp; slanderers, which abuse and scandalise publikely, not only Gods good creatures, but their brethren also. He is busie (I say) to instruct and incite such his worldly children, true imps of darknesse, to iudge false iudgements, and to accuse the innocent: And this is the reason that M. Foster and his likehaue, missed to find Belzebub or the Diuell in this number; forasmuch as he is neerer them then they are aware of.

                  M. Foster confidently affirmeth it; and for my part I must as earnestly deny it. He offereth to proue it 2. manner of waies: First Naturally, and by Naturall Philosophy: Secondly, Supernaturally, namely, by Theologicall and Ecclesiasticall testimony.

Diuine Institution, as Naamans washing himselfe in the Riuer of Iordan to cure his leprosie. The Poole of Bethesda's curing such as entred in after the Angels stirring it; or else by naturall Operation, according to such vertues as God in the Creation indued such Creatures with, whereof the same Medicines are composed, as the lumpe of figgs to cure the Impostume of the King Ezekiah, as the Wine and Oyle, with the which the wounded man was cured by the Samaritan.
                  But this Weapon-Salue worketh none of these wayes:
                  Ergo the Cures done by it are not lawfull; but prestigious, Magicall and Diabolicall.
                  The minor is denied Fludd.
                  
                  I proue it two manner of wayes. First, it is not by diuine Foster. Institution, because it is no where registred in Scripture. Secondly, it workes not naturally, because it worketh after a different manner from all naturall Agents: For it is a Rule amongst Diuines and Philosophers, that nullum agens agit ad distans: whosoeuer worketh na
                        •…
                     urally, worketh either by vertuall or naturall Contact; But this Weapon-Salue workes by neither, therefore it workes not Naturally. It worketh not by corporall Contact, for the bodies are disioyned some 20. miles or more, wherefore (if lawfull) it must needes be performed by a vertuall Contact. But not so neither, because all Agents working after this manner, worke within a certaine distant and limited sphaere of Actiuity. The Loadstone doth work but at a small distance.
                  Vnto your first reason I answer, that it doth not follow, that because it is no where registred in Scripture, therefore it is not of diuine Institution: what? because figgs, wine and oyle, yea, and clay tempered

with Spittle, are noted in Scripture, for externall Medicines, therefore must the vse of causticke, vesicatory, healing, fluxing, and such like other externall Medicines daily vsed by christian Physicians, be reputed for vnlawfull Magicall &amp; Diabolicall, because they are not registred in Scripture? Or is nothing instituted by God, but what Scripture maketh mention of how then can that saying of the Apostle be true, that God worketh all and in all? If all and in all,

                      then worketh hee also all Acts and operations, as well occult and mysticall, as those which are manifest and apparent vnto sense: and therefore all Acts are instituted by God. Because according to Scripture, Quod Deus non vult, non facit; what he will not he doth not; but when he list, and according vnto his will hee worketh in Heauen and in Earth. As therefore he instituteth nothing, but what must bee effected; so nothing is in the whole world effected, which hee doth not will, institute and decree. Whereupon the said Apostle concludingly saith: Of him, by him, and in him are all things. But I will Rom.

                        . shew this more at large, where I will handle this very Question negatiuely, namely, where I prooue the weapon-oyntment lawfull and not cacomagicall.
                  Vnto your second I say, that it is of no more validitie then the first. The maine Axiom of the vulgar Philosophers, vpon which you ground your proofe for the excluding of this Salue out of the list of nature is this: Nullum agens agit ad distans. Vpon this you frame out this Argument.
                  Whatsoeuer worketh Naturally, worketh by corporall Foster. or vertuall Contact; But this worketh by neither: Ergo it worketh not naturally.
                  
                     
First, concerning that Axiome in Philosophy, I Fludd. know and can proue it by experience to bee false. For the fire heateth ad distans: The lightning out of the cloud blasteth ad distans. The Bay tree operateth against the power of thunder and lightning ad distans. The force of the canons bullet killeth without touching ad distans. The sunne and fire doe act in illuminating ad distans. The Loadstone doth operate vpon the Iron ad distans. The plague, Dysenterie, small pocks, infect ad distans, &amp;c. But to make all this good you adde to the Axiome and say: agit vel per corporalem vel virtualem contactum, instead of Agit ad distans: I will answer first, that the Maior is vnfirme. For I would haue you know, that lightning may moue the Aire violently, and the Aire mooued by contact of the Agent, which is Lightning may stupifie, and strike dead: so that in this case, there is neither vertuall or corporall contact of the Agent, but an Accidentall comming betweene the vertuall Agent and the Patient. The like is euident in the Canons bullet, which flying by a person, without any vertuall or corporall contact, doth cast the person on the ground; for the Agent being the bullet, moueth the Medium or the Aire violently, and the Aire being so moued casteth downe the person: But though I let the Maior passe for currant; yet neuerthelesse the Minor is altogether halting. For I affirme, and it is euident to euery mans capacity, that this medicine doth cure by a vertual contact, namely, by a Simpathetical property, which doth operate inter terminum à quo &amp;

                  All Agents working by a vertuall Contact worke within a certaine distance, and limited spheare of Actiuity. The Loadstone worketh vpon Iron by a vertuall Contact, but it workes but at a small distance. Fire is the most raging Agent of all, but a fire of 10. miles compasse cannot burne, heate or warme a man 2. miles distant from it. The Planets excell in virtuall operation all sublunarie Agents. The Sunnes light goes through the whole world; but yet a little cloud obscureth the light, and abateth the heate. The Earth keepeth the light from the Antipodes. The body of the Moone eclipseth the Sunne. Now then shall terrestriall Agents by distance or Interposition be totally, and celestiall partly hindred, and shall this weaponSalue worke from the weapon to the wound at all distances? Shall the interposition of neither aire, woods, fire, water, walls, houses, castells, citties, mountaines, heate, cold: shall nothing hinder or stay the deriuation of the vertue of it?
                  What a doe wee haue about little or nothing to Fludd. the purpose. I thought you would haue proceeded Syllogistically to the period of your proofes as you begunne; but I see that you finde such blocks in the way to proue your proposition, that like a tired Iade you giue ouer that manner of demonstration in the midway, wherefore I must teare this your long reply into textes, the more peculiarly to answer by piece-meale euery particular thereof.
                  All Agents working by vertuall contact, worke within Foster. a certaine distance and limited sphaere of Actiuity; The Loadstone worketh vpon Iron by a vertuall contact, but it worketh but at a small distance.

                     infinitum, when the very world it selfe is limited? But by your eaue, Sr, the self same specifical vertue worketh her operation either further or nearer, as it is exalted in her actuall power and essence. As for example: one kin

Also we find that one Loadst one is of a greater power and agi
                        •…
                     ity in working then an other: and therfore it draweth Iron vnto it, both at a further distance, and with a stronger force. Doth not the Scripture teach vs, that God hath giuen his gifts to some men more and to some lesse? As also some inferiour Creatures he hath made in the very same kind, more vertuous in working then another? For we ought to obserue euermore (because you speake of a spheare of Actiuity) that the more vertuous the centrall Agent is in any thing, the larger will his semidiameters be, and consequently his circumference. As for example; the more powerful the fire is, the further will it cast it's heate Circularly: So that the spheare of actiuity, of the very same agent in kind, will be no way certaine; but further or shorter, according vnto the power of the same Agent: And consequently obserueth no certaine limited

spheare of Actiuity. To conclude, little doth Master Foster know the admirable power of mans vitall spirits being dilated or emitted; neither can it any way bee compared with the weake power of common Creatures or the Elementarie fire. It is a subtill influence in puritie and penetration, as piercing, yea and rather more then the influence of any star in Heauen, it is not hindered by clouds, or stopped by walls or mountaines, it is a power essentiall proceeding radically from God who animateth it, mouing alwayes in an airey medium; Doe not you acknowledge so much when with the Apostle you say: In

                     ff? Againe, pardon mee, Sir, for I say, your artificiall fire is not the most ragingest Agent of all. For the lightning of heauen is more forcible in it's operation then our artificiall fire, for though it bee a of lesser compasse then the hundred part of 10 miles; yet, it so inflameth the aire for many miles compasse, that it maketh the Creature to sweat againe with heate. Moreouer the Olympicke

and starrie fire excelleth this so farre, that it pierceth many degrees further then the Elementall fire can doe: for though the Elementall fire be full of Actiuity; yet, it is cloathed with so thicke a spirit, in which it is carried, that though it be subtile, and of the fountaine of celestiall Fire in it selfe, yet by reason it cannot mooue but in his medium or thick vehicle, namely, the artificiall fire beneath, without the thick fume or smoake of the thing combustible, and naturall, &amp; elementall without the clouds and aire, in which it is carried, it is for that cause impedited or hindred for making so great a spheare or Diameter in his Actiuity, because the vehicle, being thick, cannot without some resistance of the Aire penetrate into the same. But the celestiall fire which is the fountaine of the fire of life, by reason of his subtile spirit, which is his Aetheriall vehicle, pierceth all things, being nothing else but a subtile influence, which according to the best Philosophers aduice, doth pierce without any resistance, thorow rocks and stones, euen to the very center of the earth, as experience it selfe doth witnesse. For else (say the Philosophers) this Influence could not by little and little produce in the bowels of the earth the formes of metalls and precious stones more or lesse noble, according to the worthinesse of that starrie spirit, which sent downe that influence and purenesse of that mercuriall vapour which it animateth. But yet the life of man, I meane, that refined spirit by which man liueth, is more subtile, pure, and exalted then it: And therefore of a greater Actiuity, as shall be manifested hereafter.
                  
                     
The Starres celestiall excell all sublunarie Agents: the Foster. Sunns light goeth through the world; but yet a little cloud obscureth the light and abateth the heate. The earth keepeth the light from the Antipodes: The body of the Moone eclipseth the sunne, &amp;c.
                  If the starres celestiall excell the sublunarie Agents, Fludd. then was Master Foster to blame, to say before, that the terrestriall fire, was the most ragingest and powerfullest Agent of all. But in this hee commeth to me: for if the celestiall Agents be more potent then the sublunarie, it argueth that it hath a greater spheare of Actiuity, and can send out his Diametrall beames, further then either Loadstone, fire, or such like sublunarie things, in which, though the agent celestiall be, yet it is so cloied and encombred with a grosse spirit, or compacted body, that it cannot operat, as in the graine of corne it appeareth, whose internall and centrall fire, except it be set at libertie, will not moue from the superficies of the Earth vp toward heauen and multiplie. But to the purpose: what a story doth our Author tell vs of the Sunne, the Sunns light, the Eclipse, the Interposition of the Earth betwixt the Sunne in our Horizon, and the Antipodes, the impediting of the Sunns light by the interposition of a cloud? Verily, it is more to shew his small skill in Astronomy and Philosophie, then to touch truely any thing that is material to our argumēt. For, I am sure, he is not ignorant, that there are two things more besides light which are exactly by Philosophers to be considered (to wit) motion and influence. If he will say that influence can be stoped by clouds, by interposition of

starres, by aire, by water, or by earth, he erreth and knoweth no Philosophy: motu, lumine, &amp; influentiâ operantur stellae, &amp; non solo lumine; The starres operate by motion, light, and Influence, not by light onely. The visible light may bee obscured to vs, but the Influence will flow without resistance. And to this purpose speake the wisest Philosophers. Foster.
                  
                  Now then shall terrestriall agents by distance or interposition be totally, and celestiall be partly hindered, and shall this Weapon-salue worke from the weapon to the wound at all distances? Shall the interposition (I say) neither of ayre, woods, fire, water, walls, houses, castles cities, mountaine, &amp;c: hinder the deriuation of the vertue of it.
                  First, I say that the originall act in this cure issueth Fludd. from the wounded person to the ointment, and not (as he saith) from the ointment to the wound. Next, I told this busie Gentleman before, that makes so much adoe now about nothing; that for asmuch as this spirit proceedeth from a celestiall influence animated by God, therefore it hath no such stopps and rubbes; neither is this subtill of all subtill creatures any way impedited in his descent to feed &amp; nourish that species, vnto which, from the creation of the species it was ordained; but we must know thus much, that before it came downe it was Catholicke and generall; but after it did penetrate into bodies, it endueth a specificall and particular nature, and hath an especiall Sympathie with a nature like it selfe, and for this reason, the wounded mans spirit penetrateth through the vehicle of Aire, in which the bloud is conuayed vnto the ointment, and naturally affects the oyntment: so much

the rather, because that bloud was ayre, and ayre is dilated bloud in his internall, and that I can ocularly demonstrate: and also the principall ingredient of the oyntment was of the bloud; wherefore as we see the Sunne by his beames doth send out his spirit into a graine of corne in the Earth, and hath his liuely influence or essentiall beames of Emission continuatēd with his like; nay, the very same that lurketh in the dead and corrupted graine, and so by little and little reuiueth, that which was as it were dead and buried in corruption, making it to thriue and vegetate with multiplication: euen so and no otherwise the Sunne of life in man liuing and mouing yet in man, as the Sunne in the great world, hath his liuely beame of influence continued vnto the spirituall sparke in the dead bloud, which is all one with the influēce emitting, but buried in a dead bloody corporall graine, namely, the dead blood conueyed to the oyntment, the which oyntment we compare vnto a good, a wholesome or a comfortable earth, most proper for the nourishing of such a hidden spirit as lurketh in the bloud, being that they, namely, the ointment and the bloud transferred or committed vnto it, are no strangers to one an other, but as homogeneall, or rather as well acquainted as one specificall body is vnto a Spirit of the same degree in nature, for as much as the body of the oyntment is compounded (according vnto my receipt) ofbloud, fat-flesh and the mosse or excresence of the bones of the same Microcosmicall Species, though not indiuiduum, all which are animated from that Spirit of life which abideth in mans

bloud: The Influence therefore of life issuing from the Microcosmicall or humane Sonne and assisting reuiuifying and multiplying by little and little the hidden graine of life in the amputated bloud now in the oyntment, and also exciting the potentiall or sopified Spirit in the oyntment, no otherwise then we see the Sunne of Heauen to stirre vp, in the spring time, the Spirits of the earth which the cold winter had stupefied and benummed, leaueth not to operate betweene both extremes, vntill the party doth recouer.
                  This is the true Mystery of the Question, and I will stand to it, that the vse of the earth to rott, rayse vp, and multiplie the graine of wheat is Magicall, Diabolicall and vnlawfull, if it can be truely demonstrated, that the vse of this oyntment is witchcraft and vnsufferable; for their mysterie of multiplication, reviuification and coniunction of the viuifying spirit of the one, with the viuified spirit of the other, is all one and the same. It was a type by which St. Paul doth teach vs the Resurrection, namely, by the dying and rotting of corne in the earth; and as for the operation of the Sunne in the graines multiplication, euery plowman will instruct you in it. Now for a conclusion vnto this, we see that sometimes the Sunne is further off, and somtimes nearer, and yet more or lesse, he doth not cease to operate by vegetating and multiplying in Animals, vegetables, and mettalls: I must now heare his conclusion.
                  O Agent aboue all Agents, certainely the Angels of Foster. Heauen cannot worke at such a distance, onely God whose

But (say you) it is the power of the Diuell that makes this oyntment to doe such feates at so farre a distance, for else it were not witch-craft nor diabolicall: Then you conclude thus for me, onely God whose Essence is infinite, and is all in all, can worke thus, &amp;c: And can hee so indeed? And will Master Foster then attribute this act vnto the Diuell, the worst of Angells; and so commit worse then ordinary Idolatry, to arrogate that to the Creature, nay to the Diuell, which by his owne confession belongeth to God? Will you confesse that he is all and in all, and will you make the goodnesse more All in the goodnesse of healing then God

Will you acknowledge with the Apostle, that God operats all &amp; in all, and will you attribute his worke (the fruits whereof is goodnesse) vnto the Diuell, whom he predestined and ordained to punish, destroy, and marre, and not to make and heale.

                  Let the iudicious and Religious Reader iudge then if Foster. the weapon-curing mediciners make not a God of their vnguent, and commit not Idolatry in attributing that to a little smearing oyntment of their owne making, which is proper to God onely, the Maker of all things
                  You are deceiued, Sir, they make not a God of Fludd. the vnguent, but giue hearty thanks vnto him for that blessed gift of miraculous healing, he hath bestowed on the vnguent. Neither did the Iewes attribute the curing property vnto the Poole of Bethesdaes, but vnto Gods curing or salutiferous Angell, which imparted that gift vnto it. Wherefore I would haue you (good Sir) and all the world besides to know that all suspicion of Idolatry is in this case taken away from the mediciners, for asmuch as due acknowledgment and veneration is ascribed by them vnto God onely, for his grace in healing, manifested by this oyntment: Yea verily, rather the stile of an Idolater ought rightly to be imputed to your selfe (Sir) who so impiously dare to attribut

these good healing blessings of God vnto the Deuill, the worst of creatures.
                  Againe, we deny that it is the artificiall composition, made with mans hands, that cureth, but the naturall ingredients of the composition, which God hath originally endued with such an occult and mysticall vertue in

                  Thus (Gentle Reader) you see the efficacie of this mans reasons, as well Philosophicall as Theologicall, whereby he seemeth, through the Ignorance of the cause, to maske Gods Goodnesse with a prestigious visard of the Deuill: you see the improbability of it. But as penitent sinners, at the last doe conuert themselues, from the Deuill to God, so (God bee thanked) this Weapon-Salue his Aduersarie, led rather by a good Spirit then his owne will, concludes truely and saith, that it is not the good Angels, and therefore much lesse the Deuill, that can doe such a feate; but God onely: I reioyce at his conuersion, though against his will.

his act from that of God in Nature, as Master Foster or any other of his paedagogicall Rabbies: And although some superstitious Physicians of this kingdome (such, I meane as are apter rashly to iudge this businesse then to ponder it with due consideration) may seeme to bee aduerse vnto it, yet, they cannot choose but know, that Plura latent quam quae patent, there are many thousand things more that are hidden in the secret closet of nature, then commonly man doth know; or can at the first discerne.

                  Againe, I esteeme it a thing fit for freshwater Souldiers in Philosophy, and not for a settled person in the secrets of nature, to say Ipse dixit: this man, or that man saith or writeth thus and thus, Ergo it is so: because, humanum est errare. Ti's most familiar euen in the wisest men to erre, but it is the best wisdome in a Philosopher first to diue wisely into the Mysteries of God in Nature, and then, being confident to conclude demostratiuely; and not according to other mens sayings, but on his owne knowledge.
                  Now seeing Master Foster hath done his worst for the vilifying and calumniating of this excellent Medicine, vnto which by manner of opposition I haue, as yet, but superficially, and by way of solution of his obiections answered, I hope you will

giue mee leaue to doe my best, to squeese out of his formidable Sponge, the Weapon-Salues reputation, which like a cormorant it hath deuoured and sucked vp.

                     I deny it, and maintaine it two manner of wayes:

                           First, Theologically.
                           Lastly, Theophilosophically, or by the purest naturall Philosophy.

                     Herein the vertue and good operation of the Weapon-Oyntment is prooued to be the Gift of God; and not any act of the Diuell.
                     
                  
                  
                     MAster Foster saith, that Paracelsus affirmeth Pag. 10.
                      the vertue of this medicine to bee Donum Dei, the Gift of God: wherefore hee is very angry with him, and called him a witch, a Coniurer and a Magitian; Hee is well serued that will preach goodnesse, either to a mad man, or an vnthankfull person, or to one that is zealous without vnderstanding: But whereas Master Foster hath done his best to proue the vse of this ointment to bee Magicall, prestigious and

Diabolicall; I hope I shall demonstrate the contrarie vpon the same foundations, ascribing the due and right belonging vnto God, vnto the right owner, and depriuing the Diuell of that, which by his instruments he hath falsely vsurped.
                  As before we presume to build any stately Palace, wee must lay a strong foundation, to vphold the whole fabricke thereof: euen so before we enterprize to establish or reare a strong Castle of defence to serue as a firmer Negatiue opposition against mine Aduersaries affirmation; I thinke it fit to collect some firme grounds or spirituall arguments, which, in lieu of corner stones may statuminate and prop vp the whole truth of the proposed Question, and expresse the true resolution of it, to bee cleane adverse and different from that which he maketh shew of. I will therefore imitate him in making my entrance into this enquiry with this Sillogistical argument grounded on his owne confession which he maketh Pag. 7. The Angels of Heauen, saith he, cannot worke at such a distance onely God whose Essence is infinit, and is, omnia in omnibus, all in all, can worke thus:
                  
                  If God therefore worketh all in all, by himselfe without the essentiall Assistance of any created spirit or body, then the Diuell is no Actor in the Weapon Salue; but God worketh all in all of himselfe, without the essentiall Assistance of any creature: Therefore the Diuell operateth nothing of or by himselfe, although he in his office is euill and destructiue, much lesse in doing good, as is supposed by the curing through the Weapon-Salue, which

is vtterly against his condition, being created or ordained after his fall for another vse.
                  The Maior is euident; because a Generall comprehendeth euery particular: And therefore if God operateth all in all, then the Diuell operateth nothing; but curing is an operation, and therefore a worke onely of God.
                  The Minor or the assumption is iustified by the Apostle in these words: There are diuersitie of gifts, 
                     1 Cor. 1. 12. 
                     but the same spirit; and there are diuersitie of Administrations, but one Lord, and there are diuersitie of operations, but one God; and the same worketh all in all: It is by one and the same spirit, that the gifts of healing are giuen. Whereby it is apparent, that first God by his Spirit operateth all in all, and among those operati-ons, the excellent act and gift of healing is numbred: Therefore it is not the Diuell; but God who onely healeth. Againe, the prophet saith, He sent

Whereby it is most euident, that onely God alone, without any Coassisting Creature, doth essentially worke in each organicall Subiect, as in an Instrument created for him to operate his will and pleasure by, as well in Heauen as in Earth, and that the creature without that act, is as a dead stocke, a plaine inane &amp; vacuum without all vertue, act and operation, being vnable to doe more then the pipe without the blast of the piper. And to this effect speakes the Esa. 46.10. Prophet thus: Consilium meum stabit, &amp; omnis voluntas mea flet, &amp;c. My counsell shall stand, and

                     Psal 33. 
                     verbo Domini firmati sunt coeli &amp; spiritu ab ore eius omnis virtus corum: by the Word of the Lord the heauens were established, and by the breath of his mouth, each vertue or power thereof. And their maine ground and foundation, for the maintainance of Gods right and the abolishing or taking away of all such miraculous and wonderfull power, as is falsely by blind worldlings ascribed vnto the Diuell, is prescribed them, out of this diuine and truth-telling hymne of the Royall Prophet.
                  Blessed bee the Lord God of Israel, who onely and by Psal. 71. 18. himselfe, worketh m

                  And consequently, not any Diuell; nor Angell; nor man; nor medicine; but God onely performeth it: by that spirituall Gift of healing, he hath imparted vnto man and his creatures in their creation

and continued it in them from generation to generation.
                  It is manifest, therefore, that onely God operateth all in all essentially, and not any created organ, bee it spirituall or corporall: and consequently, not the Diuell (who is the organ of darknesse, ordained and animated or agitated to effect onely deeds of darkenesse, as are sicknesse and destruction, and not to be conuersant in goodnesse, and especially about deeds of light, as are life (healing and preseruing). As who should say, that God acting and operating essentially in all and ouer all, had not created good Angels or spirituall Organs to bring to passe and effect the gifts of life and health, which hee hath of his mercy imparted vnto his creatures; but hee must make election of that spirituall Organ, to performe such good deedes, whom he created for a cleane contrarie purpose, as shall be forthwith proued:
                  Gods purpose and will, as well in his Creation as after it, cannot be withstood: that is, there cannot be produced an effect, contrarie to his will or decree.
                  But Gods will and purpose was to make the Deuill his instrument or minister to punish and afflict with diseases, sickenesse, and death.
                  
                     Ergo, this his purpose as well in the Deuils creation as by ordination after his fall cannot bee withstood, or contradicted by any effect which is contrarie vnto that first will and decree of God.
                  
                     
Now for the confirmation of the Major we find it thus written: Deus iuxta voluntatem suam facit, &amp;c.

Contrarie to his originall ordinance, euen by him who is a rebell vnto all goodnesse? Is it possible that hee, that hath not a lot of goodnesse in him, could produce and bring to passe such a gift of goodnesse and charity, as is that of healing? No, this is performed by Iesus the Catholick Sauiour, who is the head of potestats and powers, who altereth not one Tittle, in effecting Gods Will in heauen and in earth: as it i said, Voluntatem vt faciam eius qui misit me, de coelo descendi, I came down from heauen to doe his

                     will that sent me. It is therefore onely our Spirituall Lord Iesus (vnto whom power is giuen from his Father) who bringeth all things to that absolute

effect, which without all contradicton was decreed by the Father: And not false gods; nor Angels; nor Deuils; nor men; according vnto that before Corinth. 8. mentioned. Though there bee that are called Gods, as well in heauen as in earth, yet vnto vs there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and one Iesus Christ, by whom are all things. Whereby it is argued, that God the Father decreeth, as the father and root of all things, in whom complicitly and ideally they were before all beginning; but the Sonne essentially effecteth his will, and maketh euery Ideal thing to appeare explicitly and really: and therefore neyther Angels nor diuels, nor starres, nor any thing else, but onely our Lord Iesus Christ, mouing in his Ministers, as well spirituall as corporall, effecteth, both in and after the creation, all things, that exist, and consequently the art of curing. And hereupon by Scripture (as it is sayd before) wee are taught, that it is the Word that cureth all those dolorous effects of sickenesse, which the diuell brings to passe: For first the Psalmist saith, Immisit in eos iram indignationis 
                     Psal. 78. 49. 
                     suae, iram &amp; tribulationem, per malos Angelos. Hee sent out amongst them the anger of his indignation, anger and tribulation by euill angells, &amp;c. Heere therefore you see the effects of the ministery of Satan and his angels, which is to strike and wound with sickenesse. And then in another place he sheweth the immediate curer of these diuellish effects, in these words: Misit verbum &amp; sanauit
                           •…
                        eos, Hee sent his Word and healed them. And the Wise man saith: Non herba, 
                     Psal. 107. 20. 
                     aut malagmate; sed verbo tuo, quod sanat omnia, curasti eos: verily, I say vnto you also, that it is not the

herbe or animall or minerall medicine; but the gift of healing, in the said creatures, assigned vnto them in their creation, by the word that healeth.
                  As for the Minor, it is confirmed by the expresse Esay 54. 10. words of the Prophet, (speaking in the person of God himselfe) Ecce ego creaui fabrum sufflantem in igne prunas, &amp; proferentem vas in opus suum, &amp; ego creaui interfectorem ad disper dendum. Behold, I haue created a Smith to blow the coales in the fire, and to produce a vessell in his worke, and I created the Destroyer to destroy, whereby wee may see, that the will of God was not that hee should be created, or at the least ordayned af

Whereupon Salomon saith: Diaboli inuidia mors introiuit in orbem terrarum: Death and destruction 
                     Wisdome 2. 
                     entred into the world by the malice of the diuell: and therefore hee is farre from doing the office of healing and preseruing. It is Christ which hath the office of life, preseruation and health, who for this cause was sent by his Father to withstand the bad acts of the diuel. Diabolum habentem mortis imperium (saith S. Paul) Christus suâ morte destruxit. Christ by Hebr. 2. his death destroyed the diuell, hauing the power of death vnder him.

Did hee kill so many when hee was a young physician, and hath hee inuented now, after his long experience the weapon-salue to cure some? A pretty, witty conclusion of Master Foster, and the Iesuiticall Ioannes Roberti his foster father, in this blind conceit.
                  But now I will be so bold as to produce an argument for this oyntment, not vnlike to that which Master Foster hath framed:
                  If there be no diuine institution or authority out of holy writ, to warrant any curing effect or Art by the diuell, eyther by supernaturall or naturall means, then is there no reason to beleeue, that the cure done by the weapon-salue is effected by the worke of the diuell.
                  But in holy writ, there is not found any such warrant for the curing of wounds by the diuell, through the helpe eyther of Supernaturall or Naturall meanes.
                  Therefore it is not to be credited, that the curing by the weapon-salue can be effected by the Art or act of the diuell.
                  The Maior is of the selfe-same effect with that of M. Fosters argument, where he seemeth to auer, that because the vse of this weapon-salue is not effected by diuine institution, nor yet hath any testimony or

example to confirme it out of holy writ, therefore it is prestigious. And againe (as is said before) what God hath originally decreed in the archetypicall Idaea, that cannot be altered; but the diuell was ordained for another vse, quite contrary vnto the pious and mercifull act of healing.
                  The Minor is proued by that which is said already; as also the words of our Sauiour are very efficacious Ma

                        . 12.22 for this our purpose: For when he had cured one that was both blinde and dumbe, and possessed with an euill spirit, so that (as the Text saith) He that was blind and dumbe, could see and speake: The Pharises said, This man casteth out diuells, no otherwise then by Belzebub, the prince of diuells; But Christ answered, Euery kingdome diuided against it selfe, is brought to naught, and euery house or citty diuided against it selfe, shall not stand; so if Satan cast out Satan, hee is diuided against himselfe. Whereby it is cleare, that being all diseases, as well internall as externall, are by Gods decree inflicted by the diuell and his angels, as being created ministers, by which and in which, God vseth to execute vengeance, and to punish mortall creatures. It were a wrong vnto the Office assigned vnto him, in, or immediately after his creation, to worke violence against his owne subiects by casting them out, or curing the harmes they haue effected. Wee haue many places in holy writ to confirme, that Satan and his angels are contrary to the Art of curing, and are alwayes ready to hurt with sicknesses, and afflict with death; but we c

This therefore was he that wounded patient Iob with a foule botch or vlcer, and incited in his spirits a fiery feauer, which made him thus to cry out in his anguish: The arrows of the Omnipotent are grieuous against mee, their poyson drinketh vp my spirits, and the troubles of God, which are sharply set against mee, doe oppose mee, where hee attributed all Iob 6

                  Whereby it is apparant, that the essentiall Act of God is present with the organicall destroyer, and doth act in it. Lastly, to shew you that it was wicked spirits, which, by the agitation of their Creator, did cause these diseases in Egypt: the Kingly Prophet argueth in these words before mentioned, Immisit in eos iram in dignationis suae, iram &amp; tribulatinem per malos angelos, Hee sent amongst them the fiercenesse of

                        is anger, wrath, and indignation by euill angells. I can prooue this by many more examples of holy

Text, namely, how God doth punish and plague with sickenesse, diseases and death, by these his destroying ministers, or organicall causes, which hee created of set purpose, to performe his will in this afflicting manner; but it cannot be prooued that hee did imploy them in the contrary office, namely, in that of healing and curing: For, when he is pleased to cure or heale, he hath an infinity of good Angels to performe that office, all which are concluded vnder the dominion of the Archangel, Raphael, which therefore hath that name, Quasi medicina Dei, as who should say, the medicine of God.
                  
                  I must therefore conclude, that as the onely act of God, is as well to wound as to cure, so hath he ordained Instruments or Organs to serue his turne in the execution ofboth these operations: which are so contrary one to the other in condition, as light is to darkenesse, or good to euill. Now, that it is the act onely of God, as well to heale by his good Organs, as to strike and wound by his destroying Organs; wee learne out of many places of Scripture.

Whereby it is manifest, that it is onely God, who eyther miraculously, or by vertue of his creatures, which he hath instituted for this, or that wholesome purpose, that cureth, and againe woundeth, by the meanes of his organicall ministers, be they angelicall or humane. As for example: hee causeth his Angell Raphiel, to make vse of the fish his Liuer and Gall, for the chasing away of the destroying Fiend, and to heale the blind Tobias. Also the Angel did giue the vertue of healing vnto the Lake Bethesdas. And againe, the Psalmist saith, Plag a non appropinquabit tentorium 
                     Psalme 91. 
                     tuum, nam Angelis suis praecipiet de te; but that by any authority of Text hee made vse of Satan, or any of his darke angels, to accomplish any such deed of light, or to employ any of Gods creatures, as are the Fat, Blood, or Flesh, to cure a wounded or vlcerous creature, when I can finde it in Scripture, I will in some sort beleeue it; but because that will proue too long a search for Master Foster, and againe, I finde the precedent places of Scripture to be generally against it; therefore I conclude, that the mysticall curing by the Weapon-Salue is the mercifull gift of God only. Wherefore vnto him wholly, and vnto no diuell in hell, be ascribed all vertue, power and glory, for his mercies in generall, and

for this vertue and property of healing by the weapon-salue in particular, for euer, Amen. Blessed (I Psalme 71. say with the Prophet Dauid) be the Lord God of Israel, who onely worketh all wonders, and therefore effecteth this wonderfull manner of curing, which passeth mans vnderstanding. To him therefore be ascribed, for it, all praise and honour for euermore.
               
               
                  CHAP. III.
                  
                     How by an abstruse inquisition made into the mystery of Sacred Philosophy, the question proposed, concerning the lawfulnesse or vnlawfulnesse of the Weapon-salues vsage, is resolued, and Mr. Fosters Sponge well squeesed.
                  
                  
                     IN this precedent Chapter, I haue proued Thelogically, and that by pure examples out of Scripture, that the diuell was the spirituall Organ, ordained by God in the creation for an vse cleane opposite vnto that of curing and healing: and therefore it is vnlikely, that now in his latter dayes after so many destructions committed by him, in his former age, hee can become a sauer and healer of diseases.
                  Now wil I proue in a more euident manner, and that by Sacred Philosophy, that Gods viuifying Spirit, mouing in the ayry Organ of the World, doth by his vertuous application or aspect to the weapon-salue, effect the cure of such as are wounded. And I call this manner of prouing Theo-philosophicall, or belonging vnto Sacred Philosophy;

because it respecteth the nature of this manner of curing, as it receiueth his essentiall act and being from God, mouing and acting in and by his created Spiri

                     Colos. 2.9. 
                     quis vos decipiat per philosophiam, &amp; inanem fallaciam, secundū traditionem h

Beware, lest there be any man that deceiue you through philosophy and vaine deceit, according to the traditions of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ, for in him dwelleth the fulnesse of the God-head bodily, and 
                           〈◊〉
                         are complete in him, who is the head of Principalities and Powers. By which words hee seemeth to terme the Ethnick philosophy vaine and deceitfull, forasmuch as it is framed out, according to the rudiments of this world, which doe ordaine many essentiall subalternate Agents acting and operating absolutely and simply of themselues without any consideration had vnto the Catholicke and supreme Power of God the Father of all things, from whom radically all essentiall actions proceed, which are afteward effected by our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom all things haue their being, and not from any subalternat agent, or efficient creature. For though they ferue as organicall ministers; yet they are but dead, except God apeareth and opperateth in them by his Spirit, and therefore is all act and operation attributed vnto God, as it is proued before by the Apostle, saying, One God operateth all in all: And againe

                     the beginning and the end, namely, as in himselfe he decreeth all, and by his Word he essentially operateth and effecteth all, and that immediately. Now Sap. 12.1. Psal. 33, 6. that his very Spirit is in all things, the wise Salomon doth intimate expressely, saying, that the incorruptible Spirit of the Lord is in all things, and that from the Spirit of Gods mouth proceedeth the vertues of all things, as the Prophet Dauid telleth vs: which being so, it must consequently follow, that the essentiall forme or life of euery Creature in this world, must depend on this Spirit, and haue his centrall seate of Actiuity in proportion more or lesse from this Agent of Agents, who as it acteth in the Center of all things; so is it euen continuat vnto the circumference, that is, from Alpha or the Center, vnto Omega or the Circumference: for else would there bee a diuision of the diuine Essence, which is impossible. And for this cause is God said to fill all, and to operate all in all; wherefore the Apostle concludeth (as before) that the Ethnick Philosophy framed out by the tradition and inuention of mans wisdome, is false and deceitfull; but that which is founded onely vpon Christ, is to bee embraced; because, that in him dwelleth the fullnes of Diuinity, which operateth all in all, according vnto the will and decree of his Father: who is the head of all Potestates and principalities, and

consequently of all Angels; And therefore Angels can effect nothing, but as he acteth in them and by them as his spirituall Organs. Loe, this is therefore that Theosophicall subiect, whereby I make my strickt Inquisition into the mystery of this manner of healing by the Weapon-Salue, And thus much for a preamble to the discourse. Now to the purpose:
                  Wee must obserue in the cure done by this Weapon-Salue three principall things, namely, the partie wounded, the Oyntment curing, and lastly, the occulte actiuity, which raigneth in the blood and issueth from the blood vnto the Oyntment.
                  The party wounded may rightly be compared to the world, and therefore is called a little world: he is composed of heauen and earth; namely, of spirit and body, and as the Creatour did send out his Spirit, which moued vpon the waters, and did informe, animate and viuifie them; so that (as St. Peter saith) of them and by them were the heauens and the earth framed, and by this spirituall Word established vnto this day: euen so mans heauen and his earth are fashioned out by the same eternall spirit of life, on which it relyeth and continueth in his specificall succession, euen vnto this very day. And therfore is it said, Ye are carued out of one and the same Spirituall Rocke, and that In him wee line, wee moue and haue our Being: and that we are the Temples

If he should receiue or draw vnto himselfe his spirit or breath of life, all flesh would dye, and also man would returne to ashes. By all these authorities we are taught, that the life, forme, and nature of
                     
euery Creature, doth essentially spring and proceed from God, and therefore what gift of healing is found to proceed either from compounded or simple medicines, be they Angelicall, Celestiall, Elementall, or of an Animall, Vegetable, or minerall composition, it proceedeth from their Creatour, as being either bestowed vpon them in their Creation for that wholesome purpose, or else miraculously and beyond the common course of Nature imparted vnto some Creatures to effect. And therefore man ought not rashly to condemne a medicine, because it worketh after an other manner then the vulgar doth: For God hath allotted vnto some medicines, occult &amp; hidden properties; and therefore worke they not by an externall and euident elementarie qualitie. And this occult vertue is called by some wise men: Angelicus actus,

for the attraction of the Iron by the Loadstone, or of straw by Amber, or why the Loadstone looketh towards the North, or why the Laurell or Baytree preserueth from the harmes of lightning and thunder, and likewise how directly this cure is effected, &amp;c. The causes of these things are occult and hidden vnto the common philosopher; but to come a little neerer to the point.
                  It is apparant, then, that the incorruptible Spirit Wisd. 1. is in all things, but most abundantly (next vnto the great world) in the little world called man: For as in the great world, God is said rightly by Ierome his translations (leauing the corruption of others) to haue put, his Tabernacle in the Sunne, from whence by a perpetuall, and neuer dying motion, hee sendeth forth life and multiplication, to euery member and creature of the great world, and by the agility of his Spirit, (for Salomon saith) It is omni 
                     Wisd. 7. 
                     re mobilior, the most moueable of all things, hee moueth and giueth life vnto the whole Spirit of the world; which also the same wise man doth iustifie in these words: Sol gyrans à meridie flectitur ad Aquilonem: lustrans vniuersain circuitu pergit spiritus. The Sunne mouing from the South, bendeth toward the North, illuminating the whole world, the spirit or ayre of it doth

                        cl. 1. 
                     moue circularly. Whereby hee argueth, that the spirit in the Sunne animateth and giueth motion, life and spirit vnto the ayrall spirit of the whole world (for without his assiduall motion and act, as Aristotle and all other Philosophers confesse, the ayre would soone be corrupt, and be as it were dead, and of no validity) for the reason heereof, the holy Text concludeth,

that the Holy spirit of discipline filleth the whole world. So also, and in the very like manner, the same incorruptible spirit filleth the little world (est enim Templum Spiritus Sancti it is the Temple of the Holy Ghost)

                         Timoth. 6. and hath put his Tabernacle in the heart of man, in which it moueth, as in this proper macrocosmicall Sunne in Systole, and Diastole, namely, by contraction and dilatation without ceasing, and sendeth his beames of life ouer all the whole frame of man, to illuminate, giue life, and circular motion vnto his spirit. And thereupon the Apostle reciprocally saith of this little world, as in another place of the great one, In Deo viuimus, mouemur, &amp; sumus; In God we liue, moue, and haue our being: also as this abstruse spirit doth giue heate by his actiuity and essentiall motion vnto the great world, the very same it doth effect in the little world, and all things else, when it doth not quiescere, or in se delitescere, that is, not rest or withdraw his owne act within it selfe, as shall be expressed forthwith. This therefore being well considered in the first place, we proceed thus:
                  As this Principall and centrall mouer in the spirit of each world, doth radically, and soly act and moue essentially in and ouer all, namely, from the centre to the circumference, his Primum mobile, or first moued in the great world, is the principall Aetheriall region or spheare, by the circumrotation whereof, the Sunne (which as Dauid saith, is a vessell full of the Glory of God) is wafted about the earth in 24. houres, that thereby the whole spirit of the world may be recreated with life, vegetation, and multiplication. And therefore this Spirits first, and

most worthy spheare, in which it centrally doth moue, is the Quintessentiall or Aetheriall spirit of life, which by his presence is viuified and animated: and this Aetheriall spirit being the immediate vehicle of that incorruptible spirit of life, is carryed in the grosser elementary or sublunary ayr, by which medium it penetrateth, into animall, vegetable and minerall bodies by inspiration or exspiration in animals partly occult, as by the pores of the body, &amp; partly manifest, as by the lungs, &amp; in vegetables and minerals occultly, and only to be perceiued with intellectuall eyes, and so giueth life &amp; multiplication to euery thing. As this emanation came from God, into the world, the Prophet said, Vestitur lumine 
                     Psal. 104.

                           〈◊〉
                        . the same Prophet saith, Posuit Tabernaculum suum in Sole; hee made the Sunne his Tabernacle. Againe, as hee endued the grosser vestiment of the ayre, so the Prophet saith, Densa Nubes tigurium 
                     Psalme 104. 
                     eius, qui vehitur super alas venti: Hee made the thicke and darke cloud his dwelling place, who is carryed on the wings of the wind: Againe, he spake in thunder, and

                     lightning went from his nostrills: as hee entred into the little world, or man, so the Apostle saith, Vos estis Templum spiritus sancti, Yee are the Temples of the holy Ghost; Vos estis membra Christi, Yee are the members
                     
                     of Christ. And againe, Aperiatur terra, &amp; pariet Saluatorem; Let the earth open, and it shall bring forth a Sauiour; as hee penetrated into the earth, so the Isai 45.8. Wise man saith, Spiritus sapientiae implet orbem terra. rum. To conclude; as to create, viuifie, and sustaine Wisd 1. each creature, hee put on all things, so hee saith: Spiritus incorruptibilis inest

Hence came those especiall ordinances, or legall precepts, which were giuen by God, touching the blood, not only of man, but also of beast: For as much as it was the seat of the

                  And the reason is, because the Blood is the seate of the Soule or vitall Spirit, which is inspired by God, and therefore it is said. Cron. 9 5.

                      but of beast also, is contained in that ruddie vehicle of the blood, as the Etheriall Spirit in the Airy, and that the essentiall mouer and guider of the sterne in this Spirituall barke of man, is the incorruptible Spirit of God; by whom wee liue, moue, and exist. All this Mercurius Tresmegistus (that diuine Pim. 12. Philosopher) seemeth to confirme in these words: Anima hominis in hunc vehitur modum; mens in anima, anima in spiritu, spiritus in corpore; Spiritus per venas arterias

Mans soule is carried in this manner; the mentall beame is carried in the soule, the soule in the spirit or ayre, the spirit in the body: The Spirit being dispersed through the veynes and arteryes, doth stirre vp and moue the liuing creature in euery part.
                  
                  These things being thus euidently proued out of holy writ, we will now proceed vnto a greater mystery,

concerning the double propertie of this Spirit of life in both worlds, that thereby we may demonstratiuely come by little and little vnto the very point or perfect resolution of the question in hand.
                  That eternall Lord God (who is all one and the same Spirit, because of an indiuisible Essence) is he that viuifieth the Creature; and againe taketh away the life of it at his pleasure, as hath been prooued already, for that he operateth all in all, according to the Apostles words: and meruaile not, though I say, hee worketh contrary effects, although he be but one indiuisible Essence, for these are the words of Salomon: Spiritus Disciplinae sanctus

                     so soone as hee bloweth foorth his Wind, the congealed waters moue and flow againe. Here it is euident, that the diuine Spirit is the essentiall actor in this Northern blast, which is an enemy to the act of life: For, as God did emit and send forth the beames of his light, from the infinit fountaine of his being, to chase away cold, by dilatation of spirits, and to breede a hot humidity in the spirit of the world, thereby to inact it with life and motion, and to make those spirits fluent and actiue, which before were congealed with the power of his contracting property, that is opposite vnto the other: so againe, by the priuatiue Agent, or his Boreall attribute and property, which is cold, hee contracts dilated spirits, and maketh them of moueable, fixe; of light &amp; transparent, dark and opack; of liuely spirits, substances without life; of liquid and fluid, vnmoueable and congealed; and in conclusion, motus is so turned into quies, motion (I say) into rest; actus into potentiam, act into puissence; positio into priuationem, position into priuation: But contrariwise, when he meanes to reuiuifie, and, as it were, cause the dead spirit of the world to rise, or reuiue againe, he sendeth out a Southerne spirit or blast, of a cleane contrary property, namely, a wind, whose nature is hot and moyst, and therefore in the consequence of the foresaid Text, it is said, he sendeth out his word, and melteth all these: so soone as hee bloweth forth his wind, the waters and spirits which were made dead, spisse, fixe, congealed and opack, are beocme aliue, moueable, fluent, subtill and diaphanous or transparent.
                  
                     
If Mr. Foster like none of these testimonies; I will yet goe a little further, and make an ocular demonstration to proue it, thereby the better to perswade him; if hee will be pliable vnto her who is the mother of fooles, namely, experience: Let him but looke therefore vpon the Kalander glasse (an Instrument commonly knowne amongst vs here in England, called by others the weather glasse) and hee shall see, that the ayre contained in it, will be contracted and thickned by cold: and to proue thus much, hee shall finde the water to be drawne vp by so many degrees in the neck of the glasse, as the externall cold hath dominion in the ayre, which proueth euidently, that cold doth contract the dilated ayre in the glasse, from a larger roome into a straighter; and consequently that the ayre is thicker and neerer to congelation, fixation and rest, then it was before. Contrariwise, hee shall finde, that the ayre included; feeling the heate of the externall ayre, by little and little, to get dominion ouer the cold, will dilate it selfe, and by dilatation is made more mobill, subtill and liuely; and therefore requireth a larger capacity, as is ocularly proued thus; namely, because the water is strucke down by so many degrees lower, by how many the externall heate doth vanquish the cold in the ayre. But perchance my aduersary will say, What haue we to doe with this? These are naturall conclusions, and not belonging to Gods act or property: And how proue you that the other winds are the essentiall acts of God? To this I say, That if God operateth all, and in all, then this operation in the glasse,

much more that in the winds, is the act of God, and as wee finde that the incorruptible spirit doth moue and operate two manner of contrary wayes, namely, from the center, to the circumference, by 
                        •…
                     manation and dilatation, by the which meanes it stirreth of it selfe, who is the center of all things, whose circumference is no where; but comprehendeth all circumferences or bodies, and maketh them to exist and liue, so also this vniuersal centre, contracting it selfe in it selfe, maketh' all things in act potentiall, of a liuing creature, a dead carcasse, of an agill and mobill thing, a stupid and vnmoueable one: Lastly, of an actuall positiue something, a potentiall priuatiue nothing. Wee see it plainely persormed according vnto the precedent Text of Dauid, in the spirit of the world, for as much as it is altered from one forme to his opposite, according vnto the variety, of the property or wil of him, which is the internall agent of all the world. The incorruptible spirit of

                     the Lord (saith Salomon) is in all things; If in al things, then as it is the most worthy, and of the highest digty, and the most mobill and operatiue spirit of all spirits, it worketh centrally, and moueth all the externall wheeles of the whole machine of the creature in which it is, and consequently operateth à centro ad circumferentiam. If it doe quiescere in centro, rest in the center, all the externall wheeles haue lost their life: For it is, in him it liueth, in him it mooueth, and in him it existeth. And therefore, without he act, all is stupid and dead like a senselesse stone, as Dauid and Iob haue taught vs. Now to proue that it is this spirit of God which doth agitate and animate the

                     winds, we haue many other expresse Texts of Scripture to confirme it. The whirle wind (saith Iob) commeth Iob 36.

                  Master Foster may reply; what is all this to the purpose of man, who is the maine subiect wee haue in hand, or what haue wee to doe, though God by his Spirit worketh a priuatiue property in the spirit of the world by congealation or contracting it from the spirits circumference vnto the centre, leauing the spirit cold, destitute of heate, congealed, immobile, and as it were dead and without life, and that in his Northerne nature? what doth this concerne our matter; or what is this to the nature in man? or how can it touch the act of curing in our WeaponSalue.
                  I answere, that as the selfe-same spirit is the cause of a foure-fold nature in the spirit of the great world, and as it causeth death and priuation by his Northerne and congealing blasts, and contrariwise, life and position by the opposite, or the relenting nature of his Southerne property; euen the selfesame operation it affecteth, in the created spirit of the lesser world, or man: For, the selfe-same spirit that viuifieth the ayre in the great world after a foure-fold fashion, bringeth forth the very same effects in the lesser, which I proue in this manner.

                      ad se reciperet, veltraheret, omnis caro expirato giue man his spirit of life, and to euery creature : for, if God should receiue, or draw vnto himselfe his spirit, all flesh would expire. And therefore in this place, when the dead bodies should arise againe, hee commanded the Prophet to say, Come spirit from the foure winds, as if hee should say, Come, O thou
                     
Catholike and Vniuersall spirit of life of the world, and doe thy office in viuifying and making the dead to liue againe. Thirdly, that this same spirit is it by which the Apostle doth acknowledge that God 
                     Cor. 12. 
                     worketh all in all; sometimes giuing life by taking away the killing Northerne cold, and dissoluing the deadly or immobil congelation of spirits, which did stupifie them, as it were, with the sleepy and restfull enchantment of Morphaeus by his Southerne or Easternely properties, which is to liquifie, resolue, and giue a new motion and life to spirits congealed and stupified by the Northern property: and therefore Dauid saith in the foresaid Text, Emittit verbun

                        , &amp; liquefacit ista; simul ac efflat ventum suū effluunt aquae: Hee sendeth forth his Word and melteth them; as soone as hee bloweth forth his wind, the congealed, and as it were dead waters,

                        oue and flow againe: whereby we ought to obserue that it is Gods Word, or his incorrupble spirit which animateth the winds. Fourthly, that the very selfe-same spirit, which viuifieht and giueth life and motion vnto the great worlds spirit, and at his pleasure, by a contrary property, killeth, stupifieth, ceaseth to act by life &amp; motion, congealing mortally, doth performe the very selfe-same office, when the will of the Father is in the Catholike spirit of the little world, or man, yea, in euery creature. And therefore Iob saith, It is God that woun

                      as this secret and mysticall spirit, hath breathed into the dead a blast of life, so that very blast or breath is essentially of the nature, property, and Will of the Breather, which was to make aliue, by a quickning, and not a stupifying spirit: and thereupon created spirits, which were before congealed and mortified, became now quickned and liuely, and were closed in an externall body, and in an ayery or bloody vehicle, which by vertue of this quickning blast, his spirit did moue in the channels or veines and arteries, being animated by the vertue of that spirit of life. And this is the reason that God did ordaine so strict precepts, touching the blood of the creatures (as is said before) namely, that it should not be eaten, as is aboue related, because, in it is the spirit of life, or the soule of the creature, in which is the spirituall vertue of the foure winds: For in this action of life, hee exerciseth the very same property in the heart of the creature, or little world, as hee doth in the heauenly sunne of the great world. For, as the Sunne is hot, operating by rarefaction, and exciting vnto motion, and therefore reuiuing and multiplying, as well in vegetation, as in generation, graines, plants, and other animated things of the earth, powring downe from aboue the beames of life, and light vnto the inferiour creatures, euen so this incorruptible spirit, or blast of life, thus infused into man, is the spirituall Sunne of the little world, who maketh the heart (which represents

the body of the celestiall Sunne) his Tabernacle, from which, by the arteries and vaines, he sendeth forth his beames, and animateth the vniuersall spirit of mans fabrick, and maketh the blood, agill, fluent and liuely, euer mouing and operating, vnto the nourishment and preseruation of the members, as well with naturall as vitall spirits, cau

                  But now, that I may in this place touch in few words, though somewhat allaterally, Master Fosters Aristotelicall limited spheare of Actiuity, which the old Schoolemen haue so tumbled and tossed in their externall Phantasies, without any centrall regard vnto this true and essentiall viuifying and vegetating spirits dilatiue or contractiue power: I would faine know, whether any worldly philosophicall Axiome can conclude or limit this princely spirit of the foure Winds, which bloweth and breatheth, as well in the great world, as little; when, where, how farre, and at what distance it pleaseth. I will first giue an example of his action from each wind in the great world, and shew you how it commandeth, carrieth and dilateth the spirit of the vegetable Creature. Wee can gather and collect the virtuall operation of the vegetable ad distans, by no meanes, but by the scent; as for example, Rosemary and Sassaphras, &amp;c: Doe emitt their spirit into the Aire, at a proportionated distance more or lesse, according vnto the viuacity of the acting Spirit, which is in it; and yet neuerthelesse

wee see, that, if the blast of any strong wind, doth encounter the emitted spirit of the Creature, it dilateth it mightily from his centre or plant, and maketh a wonderfull large spheare of actiuity; and that greater or le
                        •…
                     er, according vnto the power of the wind. The case is apparant and found most true, by such as trauaile by sea neare Spaine: For, when the wind is Easterly, they can discerne the Aire thirty Leagues off the shore, to bee filled with the sweet odour of Rosemary, which groweth abundantly in those parts of Spaine: And euen in the very like manner about Guiana and Virginea, at the same or greater distance, the odoriferous scent of the Sassaphras, with other fweet woods, is scented by the nauigatours vpon those shores; and that somtimes before they can discerne any land. What shall wee then say of the same spirit, which a cteth in the little world or man, when his insensible breath or emanation tendeth affectionally towards the homogeniall place of his owne nature? I meane vnto the ointment, inwhich the selfe same indiuisible nature, either in the blood, adhering to the weapon, or hauing penetrated in the weapon, without any signe of external blood, is bathed? Shall wee not beleeue, that by his emanation, it can carry along with it in the Ayre, the occult spirit of the vegetating nature of the wounded person, included secretly in a volatile salt, to act in the oyntment, vnto the reuiuifying of the sopified spirit in the oyntment? No mary, saith Master Foster! For, the Sassaphras woods odoriferous spirit, and that of the Rosemaries are knowne by sense, and

so cannot the breath of such an emanating spirit, with his volatile vehicle of vegetation, be perceiued. An excellent Argument in an externall and sensible Philosopher, who with Saint Thomas will beleeue nothing, but what he toucheth, smelleth, or tasteth: But intellectuall men may easily gather, that there is nothing that is externall and visible; but was first internall and inuisible. Neither can it be conuertibly said, that, what was internall, was externall. For, there are an infinity of inuisible and internal actions performed by God, in the closet of Nature; which falleth not into the spheare, or capacity of the sensuall or naturall man; but are onely by faith to bee beleeued. And for this reason, the Apostle saith; Through Faith wee 
                     
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      
                     vnderstand, that the world was ordained by the Word of God, so that the things that wee see, are not made of things which did appeare. By which it is euidently proued, that all things were first inuisible, before they were by sense to bee discerned: And consequently, it is the property of an externall and carnall man, to beleeue nothing, but what hee perceiueth by sense, and to say, that if any thing appeare to sense, which was not knowne before, it is diabolicall and not of God; when the aforesaid text doth attribute all, reducing of inuisible actions, to the visible sense by the Word, not of the Deuill; but of God. All Philosophers therefore haue accorded, that it is one spirit of life, which onely operateth in mans body: But this spirit, according vnto his diuersity of distinct offices, indueth a diuers appellatio
                        •…
                     : and therefore it is tearmed by them, in one respect

Rationall; in an other Concupiscible; and in a third Irascible. By the first, it is apt to be illuminated, to vnderstand things that are aboue it, beneath it, and in it, and with it selfe. For, by this his propertie or faculty, it knoweth God aboue it selfe; the Angels which are ranked with it selfe, and whatsoeuer is comprehended in the whole circle of the heauens, beneath it selfe; such is his spirituall act of centrall emanation, by reason of that powerfull vertue, allotted her by God. By the second and the third it is inclined, either to desire and affect a thing, or to eschew and flye from it; that is, either to loue or hate, &amp;c: And by this propertie of hers, she doth exercise herselfe about the Sympathy or Antipathy of those things, which are either proper or dissonant vnto her specifick nature. And therefore in this her office, she worketh mightily, in and about the effects of this Weapon-Salue, being that from these two later operations in her, proceedeth euery affection. For, as of Concupiscibility proceedeth all ioy and hope, because Natura laetatur in sua naturâ, &amp;c: and therefore by the vnion of the liuely emanation, the dead or congealed spirit in the Salue, is quickned and viuified: So contrariwise, the liuing soule or naturall Spirit, in which the supernaturall Spirit doth act, is of it's owne nature obnoxious vnto a kind of spirituall dolor and feare, by reason of the Weapon that vsed violence vnto it, the which passions belong to, and are affected by the Irascible spirit; for asmuch as it either greiueth, or is made dolorous already at the violence offered, or seareth

to bee greiued or made dolorous by it. These foure affections of the spirit of man, are the beginners; and as it were the common subiect of all vertuous and vicious actions, which befall vnto man. Now to expresse the large extension of that centrall spirit, which doth radically operate in the vitall spirit; the wisest Philosophers affirme, that it seeth it selfe in it selfe to the end, that it may rightly vnderstand it selfe in it selfe. And when it will know God, it eleuateth it selfe aboue it selfe, by it's mentallbeame; it penetrats all things, it beholdeth all things, as well present as absent; it is, when it pleaseth beyond the seas, and searcheth out things that are hidden: yea, and in one moment, it directeth and sendeth forth his beames vnto the farthest limits of the whole world, and searcheth out the secrets of it: it descendeth downe vnto the deepe, and mounteth vp againe from thence vnto heauen, and cleaueth fast to Christ, and is made all one with Christ. And must the infinite vertue of this all penetrating spirit, according vnto Master Fosters tenent, bee limited by any imaginary spheare of actiuity, assigned by the vaine Philosophy of the Ethnicks, which as the Apostle saith, is framed out after the tradition of man and the world, and not by God? Doth he not warne vs to beware that wee be not deceiued by such philosophicall doctrine, which doth disagree from the rules of Christ, in whom is the plenitude of the Godhood bodily? And must we now to obey Master Fosters phantasticall Idaea, breake the Lawes of the Apostle, to be deluded by his false Philosophy? But

to returne vnto our purpose.
                  All this which is aboue mentioned, being well considered, namely, the Catholike Nature of the Spirit, which breathed life into the creatures, t
                        •…
                     e indiuisibility and indiuiduality of the giuer, and the gift which is giuen, nam Essentia diuina est indiuidua: The diuine Essence is in diuisible and vndiuided; and therefore the diuine Spirit imparted vnto the creature, is continuated and vndiuided, from him that giueth it: his infinity of extension, for asmuch as it is bounded with no limites: (and for this reason it is said, the Spirit bloweth where it listeth, and that without resistance) that this spirit can conuert it selfe from an actiue and liuely power, into a potentiall, congealing, &amp;c: deadly property in the Creature, by withdrawing his actuall beames from the circumference of the Creature whither it did emit them for liuely actiuities sake, into the centre that is within it selfe, where it doth (in respect of the Creature) rest, and so depriueth the Creatures spirit by congealation of the motion, act and life, which by his spightfull Actiuity, it did impart vnto the naturall spirits, to make blood, fat, flesh and bones. For, this reason therefore (I say) namely, because of the presence of this incorruptible spirit, in the blood of the creature, God in any case forbids the Israelites to eate of blood: because (saith the Text) the life of the flesh 
                     
                        
                           〈1 line〉
                        
                      
                     is in the blood. Here therefore obserue, that the Spirit of life is from God, who viuifieth all things: the life of the blood and fat is in this spirit and of this Spirit, wherefore it is written in another place,

                         3. Acts 17. 24 flesh. It is easily therefore to be discerned, what a concatenation heere is of members in succession, which deriue their liues from one and the same radicall essence or spirit, and are made by it to sympathise with one and the same harmony in the creatures composition; being that he hath made of one blood all man-kinde, as S. Paul doth fitly, and consequently being all flesh and bones, are made of one blood, there must be a great relation betweene them and mans blood in generall, and consequently betweene the blood and the oyntment which is made of them.
                  These things therefore being rightly pondered, as infallible grounds, wee conclude thus: In the Question proposed, wee are to obserue these fiue obiects: namely, first the wound, secondly, the blood which issueth from the wound, thirdly, the manner of conueyance from the oyntment, to the wound, at any reasonable distance, fourthly, the nature of the oyntment, and lastly, the manner of operation, whereby the cure is effected.
                  First, therefore concerning the wound, it is a violation of the worke, which the spirit of life did effect, namely, an effusion of blood, in which the spirit of life is carryed and moueth, a hinderance and d
                        •…
                     erting of the course of the naturall humors, a diuision, and solution of the fat, flesh, and other such like parts from their integrity and continuity, an offence vnto that peaceable act of life, effected by

that incorruptible spirit of God, which by this his property, or attribute, is apt to viuifie all in all. For, this cause therefore is this radicall, acting spirit interessed in this businesse, or vnnaturall action; as finding his worke hindered, and his essentiall action disturbed by the wound or violence offered: For, wheras the blood is the vehicle of it, and his viuifying act was to circulate in the organicall blood, and to cause transmutation of it into flesh, and other parts for vegetation &amp; multiplications sake, and for the preseruation of the induiduum; Now is the same blood slused out at the mouth of the wound, and made inutill and of none effect; the body (for the animating of the which this secret spirit is euer diligently enclined) is debilitated and made drooping. Wherefore as the incorruptible and viuifying nature, hath intended to rectifie his humane spirit by her liuely actiuity, so verily is she ready to oppose all violence offered, and to correct &amp; repaire againe, all that which violent irruption hath caused; much like the wise Spider, who when her web is made imperfect, and in part broken, doth her diligence to bring it againe to its wonted perfection.
                  Secondly, the blood, as it is the vehicle of the spirit of life, though it be by the wound voided out; yet retaineth in it this spirit of life; but in another property: for, it doth not now act to liue, that is to say, it doth not send forth his beames from the centre to the circumference to cause life; but contrarily, being as it were displeased with the violence of the act, contracteth it selfe from the circumference into the centre, that is, from action in

the circumference of the creature, into it selfe, being contracted into the centre thereof, where it seemeth to rest, and so leaueth his bodily, and ayery vehicle as congealed, stupfied and dead; and here is that mystery discouered, namely, the reason, why the murtherer being brought before the murthered, the spirit centrally resting in the blood, doth miraculously emanate and flow forth, and make fluent againe, the blood, as being stirred vp by the like spirit antipathetically, acting and agitating from the blood of the murtherer: For (as I said before) this spirit in his irascible property is as apt to hate, as in his concupiscible to loue: For this reason, the Text teacheth vs, that the blood of a slaine man is required 
                     Gen 9. 
                     not onely of the murthering man, but of the beast, if it be shed by it: And againe, the blood of any thing must not be eaten; which were but superficiall, if the spirit of life did not after the effusion of the blood, rest in the blood, as also the reason; that the blood of such 
                     Leuit. 17. 
                     animalls as were slaine in hunting or hawking, should be buryed in the earth would proue of little validity. For this cause it is said in another place, Sanguine insontium 
                     Numb. 35. 
                     commaculata terra; expiari non potest nisi per eius sanguinem, qui alterius sanguinem fuderit: The earth being commaculated with the blood of the innocent, cannot be expiated, but by blood of the other. To conclude, Why should it be said, that the blood is the seat of the spirit of life, if it did not participate with it, after it is effused out of the wound, congealed, and as it were dead, and rest in the centre of it? yea, this spirit doth entirely leaue, and forsake the flesh of the dead, being that his life (as it is said) is in the blood; nor

yet the very bones, forasmuch as they participate of the nature of the most earthly part of the flesh. Hence was it, that when certaine theeues had cast the body of one whom they 
                        •…
                     ad murthered

                        . 48. into the Tombe of Eliseus, the murthered person did with the onely touch of the Prophets bones rise againe to life, which could not haue been effected, if as well his diuine as viuifying nature had not participated with his bones; and vpon this it is sayd, that after death Eliseus his body prophesied and 
                     4 King. 13. 
                     that hee did wonders in his life, and in death were his works maruellous. To conclude, the learned and wise Philosophers (speaking Enigmatically of this spirit) say that in the body there is a little bone called Luz, which will remaine with man till the latter day, and cause him to rise againe; but wee must vnderstand this after their owne sence, and not vulgarly. Let this, I beseech you be remembred, that the touch of Eliseus his bones, caused the dead to rise from death to life.
                  In the third place, I come to the manner of conueying of the blood from the wound vnto the oyntment. The blood is taken from the liuing fountaine of blood in the wounded, eyther as it is smeared on the weapon that did the deed, or as it is fastened on some sticke, Iron, or other thing, and so conueyed vnto the oyntment, at any reasonable distance. Now a reason is to be shewed, how it is possible that there can be any certaine relation betweene the wound and the oyntment: For (as Mr. Foster saith) there may be Castles, hills, walls, and grosse ayre betweene the oyntment and the wounded, which may hinder the cure.
                  
                     
First, wee must remember, that wee haue expressed in our precedent discourse, the excellency of the animating spirit, in whom is all the vertue, and each property of the foure winds, and being it is the spirit of spirits, Et spiritus spirat vbi vult, What (I pray you) can hinder his act or operation? And with what distance can his actiuity be limited, being that it is the spirit of the winds, and the soule of the lightnings, and the essence of the Sunne and starres of heauen, which by his animation doe cast their beames periferically vnto euery angle of the Horison, or Hemispheare? Can this spirir, because contained in mans blood, not penatrate many hundred miles by emanation out of his bloody vehicle, as it doth out of his cloudy Tabernacle in the forme, or rather vehicle, oflightning or, out from his Phoebean Palace in golden beames, whereupon it is said, In lumine numen, &amp; in numine lumen, In light is diuinity, and in diuinity is light: so saith the Psalmist: 
                     Psalme 104. 
                     Amictus lumine, quasi vestimento, Hee is clothed with light, as with a garment. I tell you this is all one spirit which is in man, and that which operateth in the wings; and therefore it was said, Come, O spirit from the foure winds. This spirit cannot be diuided into parts; It filleth (as Salomon saith) the whole earth, and hath his seate in heauen, and therefore Sap 1 resideth in mans body and spirit, as is said, Esdras 
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         Esdr. 16. speaking of this spirit, saith, as before, The spirit of God Omnipotent hath made all things, and searcheth out all things in the bowells or secret places of the earth. Whereby it appeareth, that this very spirit by which man breathed, cannot be limited in his penetrating

and extensiue dimension; nor yet hindred in his passage, by any intermediate obstacle.
                  To conclude, that man that beleeueth and relyeth on this spirit, may effect what he desireth: For, euen by the true knowledge and vse of it, the Prophets and Apostles did wonders, as well in curing as effecting matters of greater admiration. This spirit therefore, which is called intellectuall, as hee maketh to vnderstand; Inspiratio omnipotentis, saith Iob 9. 6. 
                     Iob, facit intelligere: Vitall in respect of his viuification, Spiritus Dei fortis fecit me, saith he, &amp; spiraculum omnipotentis viuificauit me; And naturall in respect of Iob 9. vegetation and multiplication, visitatio tua (saith hee else where) conseruauit spiritum meum, doth act Iob 11. and shine forth by secret beames, v to that obiect of the dead blood, which is carryed from it vnto the oyntment, in which amputated blood, lurketh a portion of spirit, resting without action. Now the nature of the one, is reioyced in the nature of the other, forasmuch as both doe sympathise together, being that they are all of one consonance or degree, or vnison in vitall loue: as for example, I take two Lutes or Vialls, or any other such like instruments, I set one of them at one end of the table, &amp; set the other at the other end, I put a small straw vpon one of the strings, of the one Lute, which importeth Ala-mi-re, or De-la-sol-re, and then stri
                        •…
                      the Gam-vt of the other Lute, and the straw will not once stirre, because theydoe not sympathise in one sound and proportion of wauing ayre, therefore haue they not a relation one vnto another: so also, if the blood be carryed vnto an oyntment heterogeneall in nature

vnto the party wounded, it will doe nothing in this cure; but if you put a straw on the Gam-vt, or A-re, of the one, and strike the other on Gam-vt, or Are, being vnisons, you shall perceiue, the straw presently to leap of the other string, by reason of the ouer great vibration or louing actiuity, and like formall proportion, which he sympatheticall harmony, betwixt each strings, causeth to other in the aire, yea, this effect wil happen, though there be put boords, or other such like obstacles, as may hinder the direct line of the vibration in the aire or medium betwixt the two Lutes; In which experiment you may note, that the string strucke, is aptly compared vnto the blood of the wounded, being stil animated in his body, who doth by a secret emanation or emission, and that by a naturall inclination, and sympathy, cause in the selfe-same tone a secret communication between the still and occult spirit in the congealed blood, which is in the oyntment, which I compare to the string, which the straw hath on it: so that the string though it be of it selfe still, yet at the acting of that other chord, which is really moued with the actuall spirit, of the chord strucken, by meere concent, stirreth vp the still chord to act also, and by action to send backe againe a salutiferous harmony, vnto the acting spirit, which is as neere vnto his owne still or potentiall nature, as the tone of one Lute acting or strucke, vnto that of the other not strucke. For as both are but one spirit, though they seeme to differ in distance, as doe the chord of both Lutes, so likewise are those two tones but one tone; though they seeme to differ: and

therefore make but one vnisone. But because the one spirit cannot essentially be separated from the other, no more then can diuinity effentially be diuided into parts, as also the one tone cannot be essentially distinguished from the other: therefore it doth liuely extend it selfe, à termino à quo, ad terminum ad quem: from the wound vnto the oyntment, as being all one spirit continuated, euen as wee see one thred extended from one end of a Chamber vnto the other. Now being this spirit requireth a spirituall vehicle like it selfe, it is carried, quasi super alas venti, as it were vpon the wings of the wind, in the hidden spirit of the blood, which seemeth as a vehicle: no otherwise then the essentiall spirit of the wind is carryed by the ayre, and obserueth no limited distance, neyther is hindred by mountaines, woods, or walls, to worke his effect: as wee see the Northwind doth produce in Lumbardy frost, Ice, snow, &amp;c. Although the high Alpin mountaines, piercing the very clouds, are interposed. But I will bring a more familiar example of the graine of Corne, which being considered in himselfe, without his mother earth, seemeth no way to act; for his vitall spirit doth lurke in the centre, and not operate to the circumserence, eyther by way of vegetation, or multiplication. The fountaine from whence the vegetable soule comes by multiplication, is the sunne of heauen, which worketh life in all vegetable things, by the vertue of the foresaid Catholike spirit of life, which did put his Tabernacle in the Sunne, giuing a naturall increase of life and vegetation to euery thing: For, though this spirit in it selfe be Catholike,

yet as it entreth into any specificall creature, it conuerteth his property vnto the viuification, mul
                        •…
                     
                     plication, and generation of that very species, yea, euen vnto mankinde. Whereupon Aristotle saith, that Sol &amp; homo generant hominem, the Sunne and a man, doe engender a man. As for example, it hath multiplied by the successiue influence of this piercing spirit in a graine of Wheat, being resuscitated (as S. Paul saith) after death and putrefaction in his proper earth, from one to twenty, and afterwards moueth vpwards in his ayery vehicle, with his strawie stalk, towards the fountaine of his being, and draweth by a sympatheticall, or magnetike vertue, his like from aboue, by the medium of the Carholike ayre. But it is obserued by husbandmen, that the better the ground is in temperature, wherein the graine is sowed, and the neerer vnto the nature of the graine, the better doth the graine prosper and multiply in vertue. Now the fountaine of the graines life, namely, the Catholike spirit of vegetation, doth chiefely reside in the Sunne of the great world, compared vnto the heart in man or the little world, which is vit

                     ine to the amputed blood, for which although they both doe remaine without any manifest act or life, yet neuerthelesse, they haue the spirit of life and

multiplication in them centrally contracted, and therefore it remaineth in them onely in potentia agendi, able to act; but as yet acting nothing except it bee euocated and put in action by his like acting and viuifying nature, or rather by the same continued spirit emanating vnto the graine from the Sun, or vnto the amputated blood from the spir

                        •…
                     e to the oyntment from the wounded, is compared vnto the Etheriall or heauenly Spirit, in which, the incorruptible spirits influence doth moue, from the Sunne downe vnto the graine, by the common medium or vehicle of them both: in which, the Etheriall Sprit moueth also from the Sunne downeward vnto it's like, or rather it selfe, in the graine being now buried in the earth, or from the fountaine of life vnto the dead graine or blood in the oyntment, the which medium is the common Element of Ayre. The oyntment is the good ground, in which the bloudy graine doth dye and rise again, which I will now speake of.
                  The fourth to be considered, is the ointment and his nature. Who, but a meare Ideot can deny, that like doth desire his like, or that one Nature being stronger doth cherish, foster and releiue an other that is weaker, and the weaker reioyceth in the aide and comfort it bringeth? The ancient Physitians and Philosophers haue obserued, that lungs nourish lungs, and braines nourish braines that are weake, the spleene helps to fortifie the spleene, &amp; for weak gutts wee make Glysters of boyled gutts, the stomacke

of a cocke helpeth digestion, the very spittle voided by the Phtisic all lungs, are said to cure th
                        •…
                      lungs, wormes mortified, and dryed to pouder, destroy wormes. The stone of the Kidney or blather, rightly prepared, cureth the stone. In conclusion it is certaine, that simile agit naturali inclinatione in suum simile, like worketh in his like. Natura enim laetatur suâ naturâ, natura naturâ gaudet: Nature reioyceth in his nature, Nature is glad at the presence of his nature. Now if wee looke into the composition of this medicince, we shall find, that it is of a wonderfull consonance with the blood of man, for 
                        •…
                     s before I haue signified vnto you, That the blood is the seat of the spirit of life, and that the life of the flesh is in the blood, and also that the spirit of life is immediately, as well in the fat, as in the blood, and therefore these two are forbidden to be eaten; but are to be reserued, a part for a sacrifice due vnto God; and being that the life of the bones is in the blood and flesh, and therefore doe communicate with the spirit of life, and consequently haue in them a balsamick marrow, which is full of spirits, and affecteth wholesomely the other parts. Therefore without doubt, there is the selfe-same relation of vnison betwixt this ointment with the blood in it and the wounded mans nature; as is between the string of one lute, that is proportioned vnto the other in the same tone: And for this cause will be apt to euibrate &amp; quauer forth one mutuall consent of simpatheticall harmony, if that the spirits of both, by the vertuall contact of one anothers nature, be made by conueying the indiuiduall spirit of the one into the

body of the other, that the liuely balsamick vertue of the one, may comfort and stir vp the dull and deadly languishment of the other, no otherwise then the actiuity of one lute string struck, doth stirre vp the other to moue, which was before still and without life: or as wee see the graine of corne, being put into the earth, which hath beene well manu

                     ed with the dung of horses, that haue fed on the same graine is quickly animated by the Sun beames, and made to moue, and ascend towards the fountaine of his acting Spirit. For euery spirit doth by a naturall instinct or inclination tend vpwards vnto his natiue Country.
                  To conclude: I must now come to the reaping vp of this mysticall operation of curing; Master Foster saith; it cannot be accomplished by any vertuall contact, being it is out of the limited spheare of actiuity. Doth hee, or his sharpest witted Masters know the certaine limits of actiuity in euery thing that hee concludeth thus boldly? Foelix qui potuit rerum talium cognoscere causas. But I am sure, I can discerne no such felicity in his reuelations or prescriptions of limits vnto naturall agents, much lesse vnto that spirit, which acteth and operateth all in all, and ouer all. Qui quicquid vult facit, tàm in virtutibus Coeli, quàm in habitatoribus terrae; which effecteth, what it pleaseth: and therefore, at what distance it listeth: as well with the vertues of heauen, as with the dwellers on the earth. If this great Aduersary to the Weapon-Salue-Salue, would but consider the wonderfull operation, that this Catholicke spirit produceth in this cold and contracting facultie, as when he moueth from the North and maketh snow,

frost and Ice, by the contracting of the thin spirit of the world into a thick body, and sucketh vp the fountaines of the earth on high; all which is done by contracting his action from the circumference vnto the center, or emission from the center to the circumference, causing the common element to alter from a dilated spirit to a contracted body: And againe from a contracted body, to a dilated one; for by an alteration, quite opposite to his Boreall act or Northerne disposition, it vndoeth in his dilating property, and resolueth all, that it did effect by his cold condition, in mouing and making aliue againe the waters that were congealed, rendring them diaphanous or transparent, and spirituall or inuisible things, though they were before thick, opack, dark, corporall and visible. And againe: if he with discretion would consider, how it doth depresse and strike downe into the earth, the fountaines by his presence, in his Sunny tabernacle, which by his cold propertie were raysed out of the eart

                     unne being now in the South beyond the Equinoctiall doth subtilitate there the thick Ayre, and dissolue the frosty, snowy, and Icy effects, which the cold did make in that Hemispheare, whilest the Sunnes presence, in the Northerne world did worke

                     ere contrary effects; and how on this side the Equinoctiall, by his contractiue faculty, it partly sucketh vp the fountaines of the Southerne world out of the earth, and partly by his dilatiue action depresseth on that side the said fountaines, appearing in the Northerne Climats: Then would he not call the action of this

most potent spirit in question, or limit it (according to the phantastick opinion of some men) within an imaginary spheare of actiuity, being that this spirit, is from him who filleth all, and operateth all, and in all: and therefore consequently effecteth the great works of contraction and dilatation, which are so apparant in euery Angle of the world. Will he circumscribe this action of eleuating fountaines, and againe depressing them, within any spheare or orbe, except it bee that of the round world? Will hee thinke, that this action made betweene the potentiall habit of priuation or cold, and that of life and position which is heate, requireth a small interuall, to make the two extremes so farre distant from each other, as the North is from the South, to meete and concurre in a Symphoniacall proportion? The hotter and more intemperate, and consequently the more dilatiue the one Hemispheare is, the colder and more contractiue is the opposite: And therefore the more depression of fountaines there is by extreme heate in the one Hemispheare, the more are they sucked &amp; drawne vp out of the earth, by the att
                        •…
                     actiue vertue of the extreme cold of the other. This I can, and will be ready to demonstrate, to any one that doubteth of this point, by an ocular conclusion or demonstration.
                  It is euident therfore by this, which we haue produced, that this magneticall kind of cure is Donum Dei, the Gift of God, according vnto Paracelsus his opinion, and not the act of the Deuill, as Master Foster, most vnchristianly hath published; attributing

against reason and conscience, that vnto the Deuill, the worst and foulest of spirits (whose office is onely destructiue and wounding, and not constructiue or healing) which is the onely property of this best, fayrest or purest of all spirits, on whom attend all good Angels, to doe his will, as the Deuill hath his bad angels to destroy.
                  You may therefore see by this (Gentle Reader) how life is breathed into the creature by Gods good Spirit of life: how his seate or vehicle, in which he moueth, is the blood, how that fat, flesh and bones haue their life and vegetation from the spirit, that moueth in the blood, how this spirit operateth, priuatiuely by contracting his beames of life, from the circumference vnto the center of the Creature where it resteth, or rather ceaseth to operate the effects of his office of life, as it is made manifest in the dead &amp; congealed blood or graineof wheat; and againe, it operateth positiuely to life, by which it reuiueth that which was dead, by sending out his act from the centre to the circumference of the creature, as it doth in the graine of Wheat, buryed in the ground, or the congealed blood, cleauing eyther to stick or weapon, conueyed to the oyntment, as his most naturalest earth. I shewed you how the spirit is all one, and vndiuisible, and therefore that this which resideth in the salue, and that which operateth in the body, are concatenated, or continuated essentially one to another, as being all one spirit, though it commeth from the foure winds: not diuided, I say, in essence, but onely differing in property, for it worketh contractingly by eold, &amp; dilatingly

by heate: also that there is but one common vehicle, which carryeth this spirit in the Etheriall substance of the blood. And lastly, that because the oyntment is made of mans blood, mans fat, mans flesh, or mummy, and the fumous excrescence of mans bones, called vznie or the mosse that groweth on the skull, according vnto my receit, and for that the nature of the Catholike spirit thus specified, is in the oyntment, though not working, and is stirred vp to operate by the vnion which it hath now from the beames of the li
                        •…
                     ely and operating spirit of the wounded; no otherwise then the Sunne doth operate on the earth, in which the dead graine of Wheat lyeth, and with it calleth, or stirreth vp the centrall spirit, occult in the dead blood, to operate as the Sunne beame doth the atome of life, which is in the graine. Therefore the mixtion of these two spirits now operating, in one viuifying vnion, makes them to tend vnto the fountaine of life, as the graine rifing out of the earth, would carry also his like, which was clad in earth, vpward toward his natiue home, did not the heauy coats of the elements hinder his further ascent. But because this earth or salue is more spirituall, it sendeth out his power vnto the blood, by that harmony, which the continuation of spirit doth effect, namely, as it were by an vnison, by reason of the vniformity of the specifick spirit belonging vnto man, by the vnion whereof the foure discordant elements, and euery member of mans body are vnited vnto a fympatheticall harmony, adopted to the vse of life in the creature, yea, also forasmuch, as the

blood, flesh, fat, and bones in all other vnreasonable creatures, are framed out of one kinde of elementary forme, and fashioned alike, by the same operating spirit; it is no maruell, if his blood being brought vnto the same oyntment, doe also cause health in the wounded creature, being it doth generally tend to life, which is proper to all bloody creatures, no exceptions had vnto each specifick difference. Whether this therefore (being well conceiued and pondered euen by the very zealous, with little vnderstanding) can appeare an act of the diuell, and not the blessed gift of God; I leaue it to the scanning of such as can better iudge of this matter then my selfe.
                  But now (Courteous Readers) that I may conclude this Theo-philosophicall member, with a better tast or relish vnto the pallats of your riper iudgements, and well seasoned conceptions; I purpose to fall from this Theoricall, or speculatiue course of demonstation, and betake my selfe a while vnto a more practicall, or experimentall way of direction: whereby you may the better enter into the plaine and direct trace of truth, touching the resolution of the foresaid question; and I will diuide this my practicall discourse into three seuerall chapters: whereof the first, or fourth shall teach you by an euident experience, that the agent or internall principle in this cure, is in the blood, or body of the liuing man that is wounded, and consequently the diuell must needes be excluded from being any agent or actor in it. The second or fift shall expresse diuers true histories touching this cure, as they

haue beene acted heere at home amongst vs in England. The third or sixt shall disco or the true ground why our aduersary wrote this booke. And the last shall tell certaine manner of sympatheticall cures, which will appeare sarre more strange, and more surpassing the capacity of our Sponge-carrier, then that of the weapon-salue. Of these therefore in order thus.
               
               
                  CHAP. IIII.
                  
                     Here are expressed certaine practicall obseruations, concerning this cure; whereby it is made apparant, that the internall agent in this cure, is centrall contained in the blood, and consequently Master Fosters diuell must be excluded out of this wholesome businesse for a wrangler.
                  
                  
                     IF it were indeed (as Mr. Foster would haue it) that the diuell is the sole author and actor in this cure, and that hee performeth it craftily and sophistically by other medicines to delude the simple Mountebanks, then is it not likely that there can be any agent 
                        •…
                     in the blood that could resist or hinder this his cure, which also appeareth to be the more probable, because that the nature of the wounded person, is apt and inclined by all meanes possible, to put off all languishment, and desireth to haue her Tabernacle in a wholesome and sound estate. And for this reason wee see, that by the application of salues, balsames

or inward physicke, the naturall spirits, and internall actor of life doth helpe and assist the medicines in their cure, or else they would not effect any such matter. For this reason is the Physician called, Adiutor naturae, The helper of nature.
                  Now, that the principall agent of this cure, is comprehended in the body of the wounded, I proue it in this manner: It hath beene auerred, and will be ma
                        •…
                     ntained by persons of great knowledg, no Babies, but of a farre greater maturity, both in learning and iudgement, then our Sponge-carryer, that in their manifold experience they haue obserued, and found it most true, that when the wounded person hath sent his blood on a sticke, yron, or weapon, to the place of the oyntment, and that thereupon hee hath beene in a good way of healing, if in the time of his cure, he hath to doe with a menstruous woman, immediately the curatiue power in the oyntment is lost, and it will doe him no good: also they haue oftentimes obserued, that if the wounded person happen in the meane season to haue an issue of blood out of his nose, the curatiue property will be quite taken away, and it will profit nothing after this; whereby it is apparant that this happeneth, because the act, and secret emanation of the internall spirit of life in the wounded, is diuerred from his application or aspect vnto the weaponsalue. And therefore leaueth the one to operate in the other, which are so immediate vnto it and the body, euen as in heauen we see, that agreater aspect, or more potent application, of one planet vnto another, doth drowne and take away the lesser.
                  
                     
There is another admirable experiment, tryed by a noble personage, of whom I wil make mention more at large in the sixt chapter of this member: for one of his men hauing deeply cut his finger, and that about the ioynt, with a sith, as he was mowing of grasse; his finger bled still, and could not easily be staunched. Wherefore this Earle, wished them to knoke off the Sithe from the handle, and to bring it vnto him, that hee might anoynt it: the wounded fellow went about it himselfe, and at the very first knocke that hee gaue the weapon that had wounded him, the blood stanched, and he bled not one drop more. And verily he acknowledged, that though there were not a iot of blood to be discerned on the weapon; yet if hee anoynted the place of the instrument that made the wound (which oftentimes he confessed, he was forced to doe by guesse) hee did performe as well the cure, as if the blood had stucke vpon it. Out of which reuelation or derection I gather, that all the mystery of this cure, consisteth in the secret and inuisible spirit, which is within the blood, as well remaining still, and operating in the wounded body, as that which hath penetrated inuisibly into the weapon: for, else, without the presence of the visible blood, it could not operate, yea, and out of that obseruation, namely, that the Sithe, or weapon being strucke, the blood did forth-with stanch; there is as great a mystery opened, as when the presench of the murtherer, doth cause the congealed blood in the murthre
                        •…
                      to flow and runne againe; all which is effected, partly by the contracting property of the occult spirit in the

blood, and partly by his dilatation, as is said before.
                  Hereby it is made cleare, that it is not the deuill, that by externall application worketh any thing in this cure, but it is by the centrall emanation of that spirit in the wounded, that giueth him life, which operateth ab interno, as by these experiments it is made euident. I come to the next Chapter of experimented cures.
               
               
                  CHAP. V.
                  
                     Wherein certaine Histories, touching the effecting of this Cure are expressed.
                  
                  
                     NOw will I relate vnto you the stories of certaine homebred cures, which haue beene effected by this Weapon-Salue, that thereby wise men may deeme or gesse vprightly, whether the Deuill hath a finger in this cure, yea, or no.
                  There is a Knight dwelling in Kent, a man iudicious, religious and learned, called Sr. Nichol
                           •…
                         Gilbourne, one (I say) with whom I both am, and haue beene long familiar. For he married my Sister. This Knight hauing good acquaintance with one Captaine Stiles, for asmuch as in times past he was his tenant, was with the said Captaine in the Company of very good and learned Diuines, at the making of the said Oyntment, who saw all the ingrediences apart, and after beheld an Apothecary to compound them together without any kinde of

superstitious action, where it was generally adiudged to be a lawfull medicine, and no way superstitious or diabolicall. A box of this oyntment was bestowed on this my brother in law; what wholsome effects it hath wrought, I will in a word relate vnto you, and that verbatim as I haue it vnder his own hand.
                  The first (saith hee) was at Chatam in Kent, where the seruant of one Poppee a ship wright, was cut with his axe into the instep, so deepe as it could passe, and not cut it off; vpon the hurt (which was in the after noone) hee was brought vnto me; but I refused to meddle with it, onely I aduised him, to wash his wound with his owne vrine, which he did. The next morning early I did dresse the axe, and after dressing it, I did send to know, how the fellow did? Answer was made that hee had beene in great paine all the night; but now lately was at ease. The next morning comming into my study, I strucke my Rapier downe vpon the Axe, the hilt whereof strucke the oyntment off from the axe, which when I found, I sent to vnderstand how hee did? and had answer, that he had beene exceeding well that night; but this morning he was in great paine, and so continued: I therefore anointed the axe againe, and then sent againe vnto him, and heard that hee was then at great ease: and within seauen dayes was perfectly well.
                  These are his very words, which by letter hee 
                        •…
                     ent vnto me. By which it is manifest, that the cure is (contrary to Master Fosters assertion) performed by the Weapon-Salue; and not by other secret

medicine applied by the Deuill; but rather this inuention of Master Fosters is deuillish, and the cure of the ointment naturall. For else, why should the ointment on the axe, being discouered or stuck off by the sword hilts, be an occasion of the suddaine alteration in the wound from better to worse? And why should the wound returne againe from his dolorous distemper vnto his wonted ease, after the re-anointing and couering anew of the Weapon?
                  His second History of this manner of curing was this: I (saith Sr. Nicholas Gilbourne) hauing giuen vnto mee the sewing of a pond at Charing; after I had done, the boyes of the towne went into it to seeke for fish. Among the rest Brent Deering (the Sonne of Master Finsh Deering) did goe into it for that purpose, and there had a Reed runne into the calfe of his leg: This bled much, &amp; put him to great paine, which caufed his mother to send vnto one Iohn Hart a Chirurgion of Charing to search and dresse the wound; but hee continued after dressing full of paine, and apt to faint. Whereupon his Sister was sent vnto me, to doe my best for his ease. I answered that I could doe no good, because he was already drefled by the Chirurgiō. But that would not satisfie them: and therefore vpon their importunity, I aduised them (because they informed me that the orifice was very narrow) to wash away all the Chirugions work, and to put a knitting needle into the wound, so farre as it would goe, and to tye a thred where it would passe no further: they did so, and found that it went quite through to the very 
                        •…
                     kin on the other side. This knitting needle I did

anoynt, and in foure or fiue dayes, it was well in appearance, sauing that vpon the top of the orifice, there was a dry scale. I was nothing well satisfied, to find that it was not perfectly well, but had still a scale remaining vpon it. And therefore I did newly anoynt the knitting needle ouer night, and the next morrow, there came out of the orifice, a small splinter of the Reed, and after that, it was in two or three dayes perfectly whole,
                  These are the very words of Sr. Nicholas Gilborns letter: What will Mr. Foster say to this cure? What? Was it the diuell did this cure by other medicines, and not by this magnetike or sympatheticall oyntment? verily, the case is plaine, that all the curatiue power did consist in the salue: For, the effects in curing did testifie so much; but the principall agent issued or rather did emanate from the wounded boy.
                  And alas, what could the diuell get against the poore childe, in performing secretly this cure, who expected nothing else, but the assistance Gods blessing and mercy for his reliefe? An innocent childe (I say) and therefore in the protection of the Almighty, Iusto refugium (saith Dauid) Deus &amp; propugnaculum,

                      foppery and imaginary fictions, touching the profound mystery of this cure. I come to the third.
                  By Windsor, there was one, who had somewhat to doe in the Chase or Forrest, who, as he was mowing of a piece of medow, fell backeward vpon the edge of his Sithe, and cut all his back so dangeroussly, that his life was greatly to be feared; the Sithe forthwith sent to London to Captaine Stiles, who was anoynted it, wrapped it vp, and laid it aside. Not long after, there came one to demand for Doctor Stiles, and he was sent vnto Do. Stiles; The Minister, who vnderstanding that it was about a thankes-giuing for a cure done by the weapon-salue, sent him vnto the Captaine; hee desires to speake with him: The Captaine being at dinner, or supper, with diuers of his friends, sent for the fellow into the dining roome, and there hee told the Captaine, that the wounded man, did acknowledge of him his life vnder God, assuring him that the dangerous wound did heale a pace, after hee had sent his Sithe vnto him, and was thorowly cured without any other application. And for a part of recompence, and to expresse his thankfulnesse, hee presented him with a side of Red Deere.
                  Heere you may see, that this cure was performed at a distance of 20, miles betweene the wound and the oyntment.

                        gumentū, I thinke it not amisse to certifie each reader, that there is a certaine noble Personage of this kingdome, very religious, iudicious and learned, who at the first scoffed at this kind of cure, as a thing impossible: And after that he perceiued that it was true indeed, he was terrified by such scare-crowes as Mr. Foster is, to put it in practice: forasmuch as he was made beleeue, that there was a prestigious deceit or cacomagical vertue and operation in it. For which cause he did abstaine from the vse and practice thereof; although he did acknowledge the act of it to be wonderfull. And yet neuerthelesse, beause his curiosity did incite him, to diue a little further into the truth of this mystery; hee did at the last, desire to speake with one Captaine Stiles (a man well knowne by his acquaintance, to be both wise &amp; religious, as also aduerse vnto all superstitious actions, or ceremonies) because hee was noted to be a great practitioner in this manner of cure. His earnest desire of him, was

first to see with his owne eyes, for his better satisfaction, euery particular ingredient apart, which went into the composition of this salue, and afterwards to obserue each ingredients preparation, and lastly, to behold their mixtion or vnion in composition, that thereby hee might the better discerne, whether any vnlawfull act, or diabolicall superstition, did concurre with the making thereof; the Captaine consenteth, whereupon this Noble man, to be the better informed in this matter, called vnto this composition a learned Diuine, and a well esteemed Doctor of Physicke, who with one consent, after the complement of the businesse, did affirme, that there was neither any damnable superstition in the making of this oyntment, as was falsely suggested; nor yet any Cacomagicall disposition in the ingredients, as was vainely surmised by some precise persons. And for that reason, they did ioyntly conclude, that both the medicine, in it selfe, and the practice of this cure were naturall, and consequently lawfull for any good Christian to vse. Hereupon this Honourable Personage, did for a twelue moneths space, with happy and fortunate successe, practise this manner of cure, on many that were wounded; and yet for all this, it should appeare, that some busie Buzzards, or rather buzzing flies of this nature, did put into his head, new suspicions, insinuating vnto him, that the Captaine might vse some secret superstitious meanes, or vnknowne charmes in the collecting, or preparing of the principall ingredients, which he could not discerne, and that without this, those mysticall effects could not

be wrought, whereupon one twelue moneth being past, he vndertooke for his more assurance, to make the composition himselfe, and to haue the ingredients, gotten and prepared by his owne direction, namely, the mosse of mans bones, &amp;c. And for this cause, hee maketh Mr. Cooke, the Apothecary, to beat into fine powder, such of the ingrediences, as were to be powdred, and afterwards to compound it and to make it vp, which when he had effected, he found, that this his owne composition, had the selfesame healing vertue, and prosperous successe in curing that the other had; by reason whereof, hee rests euer since, so confident in the safety, and lawfulnesse of this cure, that not one of these phantasticall Butterflies, by their painted shewes without any solide substance, can alter his minde from this practice; which when our valiant Sponge-carrier perceiueth, and seeing that all the vayne perswasions of his too too scrupulous and suspicious faction, could not effect, hee as a Praeco, or crying Orator, for the rest, vttereth forth these fragments of his outward and counterfeit zeale, for asmuch as it is stuffed internally, with an hypocriticall, and politike intent; as shall be more at large expressed hereafter.
                  His words in his dedicatory Epistle are these.
                  That which moued me to write this booke, was a commiseration of the case of some Persons of quality, reputed religious, which vse the weapon-salue; I pitty these; I presume they imagine no harme in it: I pray for them in our Sauiour Christ his owne words, Father, forgiue them, for they know not what they doe.
                  
                     
Is not this a pretty hood of zeale and religion, besmeared ouer with the fard of dissimulation; a smooth faced vaile (I say) of hypocrisie, to couer and conceale the nakednesse of a priuate worldly policy, namely, to apply vniustly, and make a wrong vse of the righteous words, of our blessed Sauiour lesus Christ, for the decrying and abolishing of that good gift of healing, which by his viuifying spirit is effected, vpon his wounded and infirm creatures', (and that which is worse) by attributing it falsly vnto the diuel, an enemy both to God &amp; man; and thereby to defraud the Creator and actor in all things of his right, and that before the face of all his reasonable creatures, whom he created after his owne Image, perswading them to beleeue, that all mysticall and occult healing, in these latter dayes, is the vertuous operation of the Father of lies, and enemy of goodnesse? And that chiefely for the company of Chirurgions cause, as shall forth-with be more plainely expressed. As who should say, that God had in this last age of the world, lost all his operatiue vertue and power in mysticall and hidden workings, as wel in his creatures, as by miracles: that good God (I say) the Creator both of heauen and earth, and therefore hee that worketh wonders euerlastingly, as well occultly as manifestly, hath lost his operatiue vertue, or assigned it, as it were by succession, ouer vnto the diuell. May not that Noble man, and many other religious persons, at which Master Foster in the precedent Text aymeth, with a better conscience, retort his foresaid speach, vpon him, and say,

                        
I am moued with a commiseration of the cause of this person, or Parson reputed, by reason of his profession religious, who condemneth, &amp; attempteth with his Sponge to wipe away the weapon-salue, &amp; to abolish the reputation of that vertue, which God hath bestowed on it for mans good, and for the reliefe of distressed wounded creatures. I pitty him, if he doe it of ignorance; for then I presume, he imagineth no harme, and therefore I will pray for him in Luke 22. our Sauiour Christ his owne words, Father, forgiue him, for he knoweth not what he doth. But if he doth it wittingly, and maketh vse of these holy words of Christ, for policies sake, or to procure the worldly gaine of others, I must speake vnto him in these very words, which Christ spake vnto Peter, Get thee behind mee, Satan, for thou vnderstandst Marke 8.22. not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men!
                  
                  Now verily, I will make it appeare, that hee hideth his worldly craft vnder the cloke of sanctity, and consequently hee walloweth the deeper in the puddle of sinne, wherefore his reward must needes correspond with his desert: For, God who searcheth the heart and reynes of euery man, is iust and righteous. I would haue each obseruant Reader therefore to note, that there is a double reason, in this Mr. Fosters endeauour, to wipe away the weapon-salue, whereof the first is the weakest, namely, a witting ignorance, or an entire vnbeliefe in those inuisible vertues of Gods creatures, though they appeare euidently by effect, and that vnto Gods glory, and distressed mens comforts. Hence springeth

the captious disposition of some pr
                        •…
                     sions, or rather pure seeming persons, which haue no beliefe in the occult or hidden operations, either of medicines, or any thing else, which is made manifest in these latter dayes: because, say they, miracles are ceased, and therefore, what now appeareth miraculous or worthy of meruaile, is prestigious, cacomagicall, diabolicall, and consequently not of God. This manner of persons forget the words of the wise man, which doth tell vs, that the Works of the 
                     Eccl. 11. 4. 
                     Lord are wonderfull and glorious: secret and vnknowne are his Works amongst men, &amp;c: And will these false iudges of Gods actions presume to condemne them, and attribute them vnto the deuill, because they are secret and vnknowne vnto them? Will they censure things, which are so farre beyond their reach? May not I iustly say, vnto such a person, that spurneth in his writing against the truth, as Peter did to Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart, that thou 
                     Acts 3. &amp; 5. 
                     shouldest lie vnto the Holy Ghost, and apply vnrighteously Gods vertue to the Deuill?
                  
                  But if hee shall reply and say, that hee knoweth assuredly, that this secret and occult vertue in curing, is not from God, but from the Diuell: Let vs be so bold, as to aske him, how he came by that knowledge? or by what meanes got he that familiarity with the deuill, that hee is so much beholding vnto him, to know his secrets? As for those of God, I know them to be farre enough from the reach of such men, to scan the reason of them: and therefore Salomon saith: Intellexi quod omnium 
                     Eccl. 8. 17. 
                     Operum Dei nullam possit homo inuenire rationem, eorum
                     
quae fiunt sub Sole; &amp; quantò plus laborauerit id quaerendum, tantò minus inueniet: I vnderstand (saith he) that man can finde no reason of those Works of God, which are effected vnder the Sunne, and that by how much more he laboureth to finde it out, by so much the lesse can he be able to finde it. And will this bold kind of people, like blinde Bayards, presume to auerre, that the occult or hidden vertue in Gods Creatures is effected by the Diuell.
                  
                  All which being thus, namely, that it is impossible; but by gesse to iudge of these occult mysteries and hidden actions of God; I would faine know, whether any learned Reader can be so vnpartiall, as to affirme that Master Foster and his associats or helpers, haue done better in attributing the reason of the secret manner of the Weapon-Salues healing vnto the Diuell, not hauing any assured testimony for it out of holy Writ; then Doctor Fludd, who doth onely ascribe all goodnesse, and amongst the rest, the acting of healing in generall, vnto God and his blessed Word.
                  Of this kind of sharp and nimble witted persons, and bold iudges, that giue their counsell against Gods cause at randome, yea, and so peremptorily, would make the common sort of people to beleeue, that they are partakers of all Gods secret Mysteries; which are not reuealed vnto mankind, but by euent. Of those, I say, who assist Master Foster in this glorious enterprize, and as it were euen with the Titanean Giants are ready to withstand and assaile Iupiter for Saturnes, or rather Satans cause, euen of those, who with the Spurres of their best encouragments

egge him forward, to inueigh against Gods vertue in the weapon-salue, and slander me and many others, for maintaining the right of God and his created nature: of these (I say) he maketh mention and giueth in his dedicatory Epistle this touch.
                  Wee of the Church of England detest superstitious magicall cures: wee haue many poore parish Priests amongst vs (whereof my selfe is the meanest) which dare handle an argument, and write and preach against such practices, &amp;c.
                  Here you see the bed, of this too precise and ouer pure, scrupulous, and too too busie Cabale eiu sdem (dico) cum Fostero farinae hominum, is broken and laid open. And truely Master Foster saith but rightly, that the Church of England detesteth superstitious magicall cures, as by right it ought, and so doe I also from mine heart. But I would faine see him demonstratiuely proue, that the vertue of the weapon-salue is magicall or superstitious; and not naturall. As for the Arguments and proofes, which he hath hitherto produced, to disanull this kind of mysticall healing, I finde them before God and man so weake and faint, that they had need to haue a draught of strong aqua vitae, to keepe them from fainting at the aspect of verity: they are so poorely armed, that a small fillip of truth will knocke them on the head, and make them breathlesse. If hee with all the assistance, his associats shall lend him, can proue it better; perchance wee may be induced to beleeue it. But:

                  The second reason or worldly intent, which hee

vaileth and hideth with a hood of simplicity and pure sanctity, is for a priuat policy, namely, to curry fauour, and to doe a couert 
                        •…
                     ruice vnto the company of Chirurgians, from whose race he is descended. For, when hee perceiued those his brethren much to repine at the continuall good, that this magnetick cure performeth daily, to many of Gods infirme and wounded Creatures, andthat not without a wonderous prejudice vnto their practice and profit; he thought it would be a worthy &amp; meritorious seruice vnto them, to vndertake the disgracing and putting downe, so great an eye-sore vnto that little common wealth; and they, no doubt, perceiuing him to be impudently bold by nature, as also of a small estate (as it appeareth by his Epistle vnto the Reader, where he saith; that he is infra i
                           •…
                        idiam, and hath but small Church reuenue) and therefore the more carelesse, desperat, and consequently the apter to rayle, and vse vnseemely language vnto his betters (for, who would bee so foolish, as to cast away his money in the StarreChamber, for a libeller or rather slanderer, that is worth little or nothing) and rashly to condemne, without any modesty or conscience, the things which are already adiudged by God; were very glad to make choice of this man, as a perdue in the forlorne band of their troopes, to venter rashly, and to vndergoe without modesty or wit, this burden, namely, as well to take away this WeaponSalues reputation amongst men, as to vpbraide me, with false and scandalous imputations, for maintaining it to bee onely naturally magicall, and therefore lawfull and no way diabolicall. Now that

this is so, the case is made apparant by foure manifest obseruations: whereof the first is; because this businesse toucheth chiefly, and that vnto the quick, the Chirurgians freehold: and therefore it is most likely, that these are his friends he meaneth in his dedicatory Epistle, where he speaketh thus:
                  I had rather hazard mine owne reputation, then men should their saluation. My friends, at whose intreaty I I. S. E. C. condescended to this vndertaking, &amp;c.
                  Here you see his religious vaile: and againe, he discouereth his hidden policy. He pretendeth zeale for the saluation of many; and afterward hee saith, that hee condescended vnto it, at the intreaty of some of his friends, whereof some in plaine great Letters he quotes in the margent, namely, I. S. and E. C. now who these are explicitly, the title of his Latine Epistle expresseth: You will finde them (no doubt) when you know them stout iudicious persons and of a deepe reach, to determine so great a doubt as this which wee haue in hand: Stout Iury-men (I say) to giue their verdit on so profound a Philosophicall Mystery. God preserue their demure worships, Amicis meis (saith he) Ioanni Scot

                         &amp; Edwardo Chalaeo, &amp;c. Now this taske concernes none more (as I said) then theChirurgians, &amp; that he esteemeth them his especiall friends, the consequence will confirme. The second obseruation is, because this our aduerse Author was a Barber Chirurgians sonne. Hence came that mighty reuerence, that he beareth them, in giuing them the title of Esquires. The third is made manifest, by that stately and vnusuall Latin Epistle in an English booke, that hee hath dedicated vnto them. Lastly, because some of

them (as I am aduertised) did goe along with him to grace him, and to procure him the licensing of his booke to be printed, as well against the weaponsalue, as my selfe by name, whereas more modesty and discretion might haue guided them, then so earnestly to haue moued and pressed the licensing of a scandalousPamphlet, a part whereof (I say) doth in an ignominious and infamous maner, point at my selfe by name, of purpose to preiudice and wound (as far as in it lay) my vntainted reputation, and that immediately after the immodest and rash composer thereof had been reprehended, and repulsed by two discreete and learned personages for the very same, slanderous and immorall insolencies. I am much beholding vnto these fauourers, of mine aduersary, and so much the more, for as much also as vnto one or two of my fellow Collegues; some of them geered and scoffed at me, for those slanders, which he vauntingly had expressed in his booke against me, both before the licensing of it, and afterwards. But as I neglect their scorne, as being too shallow to drowne my reputation, so I pray God forgiue them their follies, and abate their malice; I accuse not all, but some: For, I know there are amongst them of a more learned, discreet, and modest carriage; Vnto such therefore, because I deeme them free from this malignant action: I wish all happinesse, and desire their pardon, if I speake iustly, and that vnto the matter, when I find my selfe so spightfully netled, by some of their society, if I cared for them, or it. Wherefore, by their good leaues, I will proceed thus in my History.
                  
                     
The aboue mentioned Noble Personage, and Captaine Stiles, with Sir Beuis Thelwell (who had his oyntment from that Noble Personage, and hath performed by it, many strange and desperate cures) and Mr. Wells of Dedford (a learned, and honest Gentleman, haue cured (as they will make good) at the least a thousand persons by this manner of cure, and now there are many other, as well men, as women, which haue got of this weapon-salue, and doe daily an infinity of good in this kingdome. Hinc dolor, hinc lacrimae: From hence (I say) commeth the griefe vnto the Chirurgians, as well of this City of London, as of euery Countrey about. And haue they not good reason for it, when they lose such a masse of practice aswould well haue stuffed their Pouches; Was not (I beseech you) this the Siluersmiths of Ephesus case, who when they perceiued, Act. 19. that their gaines, which in their Trade they got by Dianas Image, was likely to perish through S. Pauls miraculous vertue, as well in healing, as otherwise (for it is in the same Chapter said, that God wrought no small miracles by the hands of Paul, so that from his body were brought vnto the sicke Kirchiefes, or hand-kirchiefes, and the diseases departed from them, and the euill spirit went 'out of them) and salutiferous preaching of Iesus C
                        •…
                     rist, they put the whole citty in an vproare, by the perswasion and Oration of a certaine man, named Demetrius, a Siluer-smith, that thereby they might decry and put downe those preachings, and miraculous operations of St. Paul, as well in healing, as otherwise, which hee did effect, not onely in that Citty, but ouer all Asia, crying

out against all truth and reason, Great is Diana of the Ephesians! inferring thereby, falsely, that Pauls Doctrine and curing was erronious, and his miracles diabolicall? Doth not this Champion for the Chirurgians, I meane Mr. Foster, resemble in euery point the Ephesian Demetrius, for as much as hee conspireth with the Artists of his fathers Trade, to moue the whole Citty, yea, and countrey, to murmur and repine at the vertuous act of that gift, which God hath imparted vnto the weapon-falue, and exclaime against such as vse it, vnto Gods glory, and the good of mankinde; because it doth derogate, and taketh away the profit and gaine from the Trade of Chirurgians? Did not Demetrius vnder pretence of zeale and Religion vnto the false and Ethnick Goddesse Diana, derogate all he could from the honour and glory of Iesus Christ, and that chiefely for the Company of Siluer-smiths profit and gaines sake? And doth not Foster in the very same manner, vnder an hypocriticall shaddow or vaile of sincerity, ascribe the power of healing by the weapon-salue vnto the diuell, the falfe god of this world, and in so doing, doth derogate from the diuine honour and vertue of the true God, who made heauen and earth, thereby to poyson and intoxicate the opinions of vertuous or well minded men, and to distract them from the truth, by his false perswasions, as Demetrius attempted to doe with the honest Ephesians: For as much as he with his Chirurgicall faction, seemeth to cry out like another Demetrius, Great is our Esculapius, the god of Chirurgians, and his inuentions of balmes, emplasters,

and salues: and consequently diabolicall is the Weapon-Salue, which cureth all wounds miraculously at a distance, and not by Contact? Did not Galen in the like manner raile and scoffe at Christ and his Disciples, for their curing so strangly at distance, and that without any ocular demonstration. And the reason why? was, because he could not cure spiritually at distance; but onely grossely and by an immediate contact.
                  If I therefore like the Ephesian towne-Clarke, shall with words of reason and truth, seeke to appease the vniust rumours and needlesse iealousies, stirred vp by this our Sponge-bearing Demetrius, and ascribe with the words of verity, that vnto God the Father, and his Sonne Iesus Christ, which belongeth to him, and tell the Diuell and his minister vnto his face, that all goodnesse, and therefore each healing property belongeth vnto God the Creatour of all things, and not to any vile creature, much lesse vnto the Diuell. Doe I (thinke you) doe amisse? Was it not (I pray you) for these very words of Paul, that in his Sermon at Athens Demetrius and his crafts men were so much offended with him.
                  The Lord (saith he) who hath made heauen and Acts 17.24. earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, netther is worshipped with mens hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giueth to all, life, and breath and all things: and hath made of one blood all mankind &amp;c: For in him we liue, and moue, and haue our Being, for wee are also his generation. For as much then as wee are the

                      grauen by art and the inuention of man, &amp;c.
                  This angred Demetrius and his company, namely to say, that the Godhead is not like vnto gold or siluer grauen by art, which if they had suffered, no body would haue bought the images of Diana, framed by them: In like manner, this Chirurgicall faction decryes the Weapon-Salue, fearing that few wounded persons would trouble them for their cure, being that frustra fit per plura, quod potest fieri per pauciora: it would bee but vaine for a wounded man, to bee tormented by flashing, eating corrosiues, incisions, and dolorous tentings of Chirurgions, besides great bargaines and compacts for the cures, and perchance also little attendance, when the immediate Act of God doth operate the 
                        •…
                     ure gratis, gently, without dolorous tents or grieuous incision, and that honestly without an ill conscience, seeing that it is Gods Spirit; which doth operate as well in the blood as salue. For (I beseech you) obserue the words of Saint Paul (which if they moue in some degree the Ephesian siluersmiths, they will much more nettle such couetous Chirurgians, as would suffocate and smoother, this excellent and diuine vertue in the WeaponSalue, whose originall is ofblood:) The which words that you may with the better solidity conceiue, you must gather or collect out of them, these three seuerall things: First, that the Lord of Lords is hee, who hath made heauen and earth, whereupon wee collect, tha the which hath made heauen

and earth, is the guider and operatour, both in the spirit and body, of both the great and little world called man: and therefore neither Hag nor diuel can work to the health, sustentation or preseruation of either: as the consequence shall confirme; For the Text saith: Hee giueth life, breath, and all things. Next, hee hath made all mankind of one blood and spirit: And therefore he operateth all in all in mans blood in generall, as well to life as health. And againe: the spirit of the dead mans bones, and consequently their excrescence, which issued originally out of mans blood, in the which in part lurketh Gods Spirit of life, hath an homogeniall reference, vnto the liuely blood of man, for as much as the Text saith, that all mankind is made of one blood onely: and therefore this vnion of symphoniacall or sympatheticall harmony, is not easily to bee limited, by Master Fosters phantasticall spheare of actiuity. For the text following vnto the Athenians is: In him wee liue. and moue, and haue our Being. And lastly, that wee are the Generation of God: and for that cause, Christ did not disdaine, to call vs his Brethren and the Sonnes of God. Neither is it sufficient to say (as these precisians doe) that this is ment onely of the Beleeuers; and not of the Infidels. For Saint Paul, at that very time, when hee preached this doctrine, spake vnto the Idolaters, and such as worshiped vnknowne gods: and he did let them to know th
                        •…
                     s much; namely, that they liued, moued, and had their being in the true God, and that this Lord of Lords giueth life and breath, and being, and that they were all of

Gods Generation. All this hee truely taught, that thereby they might leaue their false gods, and betake themselues vnto their right Lord &amp; only God, from whom, by whom, &amp; in whom they exist, and Rom. 12.32. persist in their being, as hee declareth else-where. Let therefore Demetrius, his Goddesse Diana be forgotten, and let Fosters healing diuell be depriued from all his imaginary power &amp; practice in curing of wounds. And lastly, let all couetuous Chirurgians expectations be thorowly quashed, and disanulled, by this inuiolable assertion of the Apostle.
                  Though there be that are called Gods, whether in heauen or in earth, (as there be many gods and many lords) 1 Cor. 8.5. yet vnto vs there is but one God, which is that Father of whom are all things, and wee in him, and one Lord, Iesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him: but euery man hath not that knowledge.
                  Let M. Foster mark this: as who shouldsay, though the Ephesian Demetrius with his complices, did attribute all power vnto the false Goddesse Diana, and Foster, the secret &amp; maruellous power of healing by the weapon-salue vnto the diuell, as the prince of this world, without any consideration vnto this Text; yet it is certaine, that it is God the Father, of whom are al things: and consequētly, this act in curing and by our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom are all things, and therefore each blessed gift of healing. For, Salomon auerreth, that it is the Word that cureth all things. But, saith the Text, Euery man hath not this knowledge, &amp;c. Wherefore Mr. Foster is the more to be blamed, to professe the name of Gods Minister, and to be ignorant in this point. Or at the leastwise, if he knew it, hee is to be blamed both before God and man, to

speake so bluntly, and against his conscience, for any pruiuate companies cause, or worldly affection, yea, it may appeare, that hee was troubled in his conscience, when hee writ so staggeringly, and vnaduisedly, touching the originall cause of this cure. For, first of all, pag. 8. he saith, that it is not the salue that cureth, but the diuell, by the secret applications of other medicines: In another place, namely, pag. 17. hee acknowledgeth, that the act of curing, is the salue but concludeth it to be magicall, by reason of the superstitious obseruations in the collection or gathering of the ingrediences, and in the anoynting of the weapon. Then pag. 39. hee seemeth to auerre, that it is the bathing of the wound with Vrin, and the keeping it cleane, which doth effect this cure; whereby hee taketh away all vertue from the salue, and acting power from the diuell. But pag. 7. hee saith, that it is onely God that cureth at such a distance, for as much as his essence is infinite, and is omnia in omnibus, and not any Angell. The Gentleman you see is in many minds, God amend him, and make his head-piece more setled, and of a more solid consistence, and constant nature, or wee shall be troubled heereafter with many words; but little substance appertaining to the right matter. I heare he threatneth me with a volume of some impieties, and I know not what, which hee hath found in my works: I am sure hee will proue but Mersennus and Gassendus his Ape or Parroket. For hee professeth them his Masters, and therefore I will quickly serue and afford him the same sauce, or answer I haue bestowed ont hem. Let him appeare when he dareth, and take the best assistance, his home-bred setters on can afford him; I feare neyther him nor them, nor

                     Mersennus, nor Lanouius, nor Gassendus, his papisticall Masters: For, I haue (I hope) the buckler oftruth for my defence.
                  I will now passe vnto the next Chapter, wherein I will expresse certaine histories, of certaine magicall cures, which in mine opinion, are farre more admirable then this of the weapon-salue.
               
               
                  CHAP. VII.
                  
                     In this Chapter, certaine Magneticall, or Sympatheticall affects are expressed, which appeare farre more admirable, then this of the weapon-salue.
                  
                  
                     SIr Nicholas Gilbourn relateth in his letter vnto mee these words: The last time (saith he) the Lady Ralegh was at Eastwell at the Countesse of Winchelsey her house, wee falling into some discourse, concerning the Sympatheticall oyntment, shee told mee, that her late husband, Sir Walter Ralegh, would suddenly stop the bleeding of any person (albeit hee were farre and remote from the party) if he had a handkirchers, or some other piece of linnen dipped in some of the blood of the party sent vnto him. If this were done by the diuell, I presume, that so wise a Personage, as was Sir Walter Ralegh, would haue lest, or at least-wise not haue vsed that Trade of curing or stopping of blood.
                  There are foure histories more, that I wil tell you, whereof the two first are forraine, and the two last were acted at home namely here in England.
                  
                     
The first of the forraine Stories was acted in Italy, and hath beene there so famous and remarkeable, that vnto this present, it is as well in the natiue countrey-mans mouth, as in the report of such trauellers as haue passed thorow the countrey; yea, and there are authors of credit, that haue enrolled it in their written monuments. It was thus: There was a certaine Lord, or Nobleman of Italy, that by chance lost his nose in a fight or combate, this party was counselled by his Physicians to take one of his slaues, and make a wound in his arme, and immediately to ioyne his wounded nose to the wounded arme of the slaue, and to binde it fast, for a season, vntill the flesh of the one was vnited and assimulated vnto the other. The Noble Gentleman got one of his slaues to consent, for a large promise of liberty and reward; the double flesh was made all one, and a collop or gobbet of flesh was cut out of the slaues arme, and fashioned like a nose vnto the Lord, and so handled by the Chirurgion, that it serued for a naturall nose. The slaue being healed and rewarded, was manumitted, or set at liberty, and away he went to Naples. It happened, that the slaue fell sicke and dyed, at which instant, the Lords nose did gangrenate and rot; whereupon the part of the nose which hee had of the dead man, was by the Doctors aduice cut away, and hee being animated by the foresaid experience, followed the aduice of the same Phisician, which was to wound in like manner his owne arme, and to apply it to his wounded and mutilated nose, and to endure with patience, till all was compleate as before. He with animofity &amp; patience, did vndergoe the brunt,

and so his nose continued with him vntill his death.
                  What? Must wee esteeme this worke the act of Gods spirit in man, or a deceitfull and prestigious operation and trumpery of the diuell? Verily, it must needes by wise men be adiudged to proceed from that good act of Gods viuifying spirit, which did operate by way of life and vegetation in them both. Is it not strange therefore (the one liuing about Bolongnia in Italy, and the other being in Naples) that according to Master Fosters tenent, neither the tall Hills of Hetruria; nor yet the high Appenine mountaines could stop the concourse and motion of these two spirits, or rather one spirit continuated in two bodies, as a line being stretched out from two extremes, of so farre a distance. Surely M. Foster will say, this is Magicall and diabolicall.
                  The second forraine Story was this.
                  I was, whilest I did soiourne in Rome, acquainted with a very learned and skilfull personage, called Master Gruter, hee was by birth of Swisserland: and for his excellency in the Mathematick, and in the Art of motions and inuentions of Machins, he was much esteemed by the Cardinall Saint George: This Gentleman taught mee the best of my skill in those practices: and amongst the rest, hee deliuered this magneticall experiment vnto me, as a great secret, assuring me that it was tried in his Country, vpon many with good successe. When (said he) any one hath a withered and consumed member, as a dried arme, leg, foot, or such like, which physicians call an Atrophie of the lims, you must cut from that member, bee it foot or arme, the nailes, haire, or some part of the skin, then you must pierce

a willow tree with an Auger or wimble vnto the pith, and afterward put into the hole the pared nailes and skin, and with a peg made of the same wood, you must stoppe it close: Obseruing that in this action the Moone be increasing, &amp; the good Planets in such a multiplying Signe, as is Gemini, and fortunate and powerfull ouer Saturne, which is a great dryer. The selfe-same effect (said hee) you shall finde in you, take the nailes and haire, which is cut off the member, and close them in the roote of an hasle tree, and shut vp the hole, with the barke of the tree, and after couer it with the earth, and (said he) it hath beene tried, that as the tree dayly groweth and flourisheth, so also by little and little, will the patient recouer his health. But you must with diligence obserue, the motion of the heanenly bodies, and especially the places of the Sunne and Moone, when this is effected. And to this intent, he did disclose vnto me, the time and seasons when the preparion vnto such a cure should be effected. But alas! What haue I done? Now hath Mr. Foster enough to cry out that this is Magick indeed; here is superstition in the highest degree: For did not he say pag. 17. that it is an astrologicall, and therefore superstitigus obseruation to collect any ingredient, or to doe any thing by attending and expecting, when the Moone should bee in such or such a house of heauen, and that by Scriptures, Astrologers, Magitians and Sorcerers, like birds of a feather, are linked together? A worshipfull exploit in in this demure Gentleman! His blindnesse leadeth him in this as in the rest. For first hee concludeth, that all Magick in generall is damnable and diabolicall, because one species or member of it, is iustly

to be banished from Christian mens remembrance: as if there were not a naturall magick, by which Salomon did know all the mysteries in nature, and the operations thereof; yea, as if the three wise Kings of the East, did discouer, that the true King of the Iewes was borne, by diabolicall Magick. How now Master Foster, were these three wise men Cacomagicall Magitians, or such as the Scripture did allow of, and we Christians keepe a holy day in their remembrance? Right Friar Mersennus his ape! For he condemneth all Magia without exceptions of kinds; not remembring, that Magus is in the Persian tongue interpreted a wise man or a priest. And in the very same manner, this Gentleman, after his Masters custome condemneth all Astrologie, for that members sake, which is truely superstitious and vnlawfull; not considering, that the verity in both, the true Magick and Astrology hath been falsely contaminated and abused by superstitious worldlings, and thereupon made the good, in the eyes of the ignorant, to bee abolished and condemned with the bad, for the bad sake: and so goodnesse by vile men is swallowed, without any difference, by darknesse.
                  I would therefore haue our Sponge-bearing aduersary know, that there are foure parts or kinds of Astrology in generall. The first is conuersant about the mutation of the aire, and foretelling of tempests, diseases, famine, or plenty, &amp;c. The second foretelleth the alterations of states, as also wars, or a pacifick dispotion in the minds of men. The third intreateth of the election of times, and of natiuities. The last is directed vnto the fabricating of characters,

seales and Images, the which, because it mingleth it selfe with superstitious actions, &amp; is made an instrument for the abuses of impious persons; and especially, because a diabolicall insinuation vnto vice and impiety, may easily be perceiued in it, is of all good Christians to be repudiated and condemned for vnlawfull What? Is the Almanack makers Science for this Mr. Fosters exceptions, to be put downe, or must Physicians be forced to forsake or neglect their houres of election, ingathering of simples, or letting blood, or cutting the hayre and nailes, or stopping laxes, or making the belly lubricke for this mans caueat? Doth not Amicus medicorum auerre, that the influence of heauen, may helpe the working of medicines? For (saith hee) Oftentimes medicines laxatiue, are by vnskilfull Phisicians, giuen vnder an influence of heauen, that worketh a contrary or stiptick effect, &amp; so are hindred. Also saith he, Sometimes medicine is giuen to stop, when the disposition of the heauens are lubrick and laxactiue, and then the medicine loseth his effect. And for this cause, Haly saith, the Physician that is ignorant in Astrology, is as a blinde man, searching out his way without a staffe, groping and reeling this way and that way. And Ptolomeus, that a good Astrologian may auert many effects of the stars which are to come. Doth not Galene &amp; Hipocrates speake much in their critical treatises, of the necessity of obseruing the Moones motion? But letting this passe: What say wee to the husbandmans obseruation of times and seasons, as well in sowing as in reaping? If this will not serue to stop our Aduersaries violence, wee will comevnto the testimonie of Scriptures: for the confirmation as well of election of seasons, as to proue that the influence of the heauens doth operate

as well good as euill effects. For the first it is said, Eccl 3. 
                     Est tempus plantandi, &amp; tempus exstirpandi quod fuit plantatum: Est tempus belli, &amp; est tempus pacis, &amp;c. There is a time to plant, and a time to pull vp what is planted: there is a time of war, and a time of peace; And the Son of Syrach: in the good day, enioy that which is good, and beware of 
                     Eccl 7. 
                     the euill day, as God made the one, so also 
                           〈◊〉
                         ordained the other: An S. Paul wisheth vs, to put on the armour of 
                     Ephes. 6. 
                     God, that wee may resist the diuell in the vnfortunate day. Now, if the starres be the distinguisher and guider of times, as Moses telleth vs, surely the influence eyther good or bad for them, maketh good or bad Angells, to haue more or lesse dominion ouer creatures. That there are bad influences from aboue, these words of Dauid doe testifie: Deus est custos tuus, Sol &amp; non percutiet dierno tempore; nec Luna nocte: God is thy preseruer, the Sunne shall not strike or wound thee by day, nor the Moone by night, &amp;c. And is it not acknowledged, that the Moone is the procurer of the Epilepticke disease? Where it is said in the Euangelist in plaine termes, that the possessed was Lunatick? Also that there are good influences from aboue, it is argued by this Iob 38. 21. Text of Iob, Canst thou restraine the sweet influences of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in their time? Canst thou also guide Arcturus with his sonnes? Knowest thou the course of heauen? or canst thou set the rule thereof on the earth, &amp;c? For in this Text, wee finde the good influences of the starres are mentioned: and heere also it is expressely noted, that the heauens haue their powers on the earth.
                  I boldly affirme therefore, that all Astrology is not forbidden for as much as there is an especiall obseruation to be had by wise men, of the influence of the

stars. And for that purpose, there are houres of election, duely to be obserued according vnto this or that influence, which is most proper and conuenient for our worke. Againe, whereas Mr. Foster seemeth to make so slight account of the 12. Signes, and their essentiall operations on the earth; he may see, that such as haue made their allaterall notes vpon the Text, doe interpret the word Mazzaroth, to signifie the 12. signes, which doe possesse the 12. houses of the Zodiack, which being so, marke the Texts conclusion: Canst thou set the rule thereof on the earth? whereby it is euident, that the 12. signes, haue an especiall rule ouer the earth, and the creatures thereof, and that by Gods ordinance and appointment.
                  By this it is made manifest, that there is no Cacomagicall superstition, in obseruing times, daies, or houres, in which this or that starre hath dominion, for the collecting of ingrediences, or preparation and adaption of medicines, or other matters, proper for the cure of man, as Mr. Foster doth vniustly auerre.
                  To conclude, therfore this point, we may discerne by the foresaid experiment, how the vegetatiue force of the plant operateth, in the excrementitious parts of the withered member, no otherwise then the ointment in the amputed blood, and how the spirit of those nailes and haire, and skin, do participate with that of the withered member, no otherwise then that of the blood in the oyntment, doth with the bloody spirits of the wounded, or as the vrinall excrements, with the blood in
                        •…
                     ected with the 
                        •…
                     aunders, as shall be told you heereafter, or else they could not conferre or exspire the vegetating spirit of the plant, vnto the decayed member; neither could the spirit in the decayed member, magnetically

draw the vegetating spirit of the plant vnto it, that by the addition of its power, it might with the more speed prosper and recouer.
                  It is commonly obserued amongst vs, yea, and familiar in old wiues practice, that if a piece of fresh beefe be rubbed well on warts, either in the hand or other member, and buried in the ground, the warts haue bin accustomed to fade by little and little, as the beefe doth rot and putrifie in the ground: and that if the party that hath the warts be at a farre distance from the place, where the beefe is buried. Must this kind of cure also be cacomagicall, or diabolicall? yea, verily, as well as the rest, if that be true which M. Foster and his associates doe auerre.
                  I could remember each reader of many of these vsuall conclusions in naturall Magicke, which being well pondered, would, I imagine, proue
                        •…
                     farre enough in euery wise mans iudgement, from any diabolicall practice or commerce; but because I feare, I should be in doing, more tedious then delectable, vnto each curious, I will come briefely vnto the two homebred histories, which I did promise vnto you before.
                  The first of our homebred histories is this: There is at this present, an honest religious Gentlewoman about London, that taketh an herbe, called the Rose of the Sunne, which hath small husks about it, which will open and shut, and shee putteth it in plantain-water, and it shutteth and closeth vp. She therefore, when a woman with child beginneth her labour, giueth her a little plantain-water, and though the labouring woman, appeareth to the Midwife neuer so ready to be deliuered; yet if the Gentlewoman see the vegetable closed, she concludeth, that they are deceiued, and that

there is no such matter, and so it proueth indeed. Againe, when the Midwife doubteth of her deliuery, and yet she is indeed neer it; The flower will open by little and little as the Matrix doth, and then the Gentlewoman bids the Midwife looke to it, assuring her, that she is ready for it, and it proueth so. This story was related very lately vnto mee, by a Noble man of worth, and confirmed by a reuerent Doctor and his Apothecary, who 
                        •…
                     erre, that certaine Midwiues doe at this day, make 
                        〈◊〉
                      of this naturall conclusion.
                  Now I know, that M. Foster will say, that this also is diabolicall and superstitious. Good God, what will this man leaue to be ascribed and attributed, to the onely actor in all operations, as well vulgar as mysticall, when there is nothing hidden, or rare in this world, which this greater agent for the diuell, then I am a witch, as he termeth me, doth not attribute to his Master, the diuell, so that God forsooth must be granted to act only in vulgar and sensible things, but as for all hidden mysteries, the actiuity of those must proceed from the diuell, and be only attributed vnto him. To conclude, we see an admirable sympathy, betwixt the vegetable, minerall and Animall, and the parts of mans body, as the coultsfoot, which is framed like the lungs, is good for the lungs: herniaria for the rupture, liuerwort for the liuer, eyebright for the eyes; and againe, among minerals, Gold for the heart, and Siluer for the braine, brimstone for the lungs, yron for the spleene, as also the spleenstone cureth the spleene, if it be worne on the wrest. And why may not the herbe haue the like relation and correspondence in nature with the matrix; And that by reason of the vehicle of plantainwater, which did communicate, the nature of

the one with the other, the ayre being the common medium.
                  
                  The last hom ebred story is this: There is a Noble Personage in this kingdome of no meane descent, Title and ranke, among the English Nobility, a most wise, graue, aged, and religious Gentleman, I say, who hath cured a hundred in his time, of the yellow Iaunders, the patient being 10. 20. 30. 40. (yea, &amp; as he and others haue reported) almost 100. miles off from him: and many of them, that hee hath so cured, haue laine long drooping vnder the burthen of this disease, before they came to him, in so much that the vse of cōmon receits of physicians could not ouercome it. Hee hath both performed it by his seruants at home, and hath communicated the secret vnto some of his friends abroad, amongst whom he hath bin pleased to rank my selfe. The vrin therefore of the patient, is sent vnto this great Lord. His māner of cure is this, he taketh the ashes of a wood, cōmonly knowne and growing here amongst vs in England, hee maketh a past of this wood with the vrin, reseruing a little of the vrin a part for another purpose, this past so molded &amp; made vp with vrin, is diuided into 7. or 9 lumps or balls, and in the top of each of these, he maketh a small hole, and putteth in it a litle of the vrin remaining, &amp; into those parts of vrin, hee putteth a blade of saphron. And so without further doing, hee puts the lumps in a secret place, where they must not be stirred, left the cure be hindred. And experience hath taught the world, many a score of icteritiall men, or infected with the yellow Iaunders, haue by this simple meanes beene cured: and this is well knowne vnto a 1000. persons. Lord! What a diabolicall medicine will this appeare in the chaste

eies of Mr. Foster? 
                     
                        •…
                     e wil straight way cry out, This is abominable and diabolicall witch-craft, and they are witches and coniurers that do vse it! But beware Mr. Foster of railing, or calumniating this personage; for he is such a one, as will endure no coals, but will chastice any of your vnmannerly brauadoes. What, I say? Is the diuell in the sick mans water, or is it in the burnt ashes of the wood? (They say, that witches implements being burnt, causeth all magicall power to vannish) or is it in the poore blades of saphron, that are drenched in the vrin; No truly, but rather in their conceits that dreame so. For it is most certaine, that the plant and the saphron haue hidden properties in them, to cure the Iaunders. All the mystery therefore of this cure, belongth vnto the respect or relation, which is between the blood of the infected, and the whay of the blood, which carrieth with it partly some of the naturall salt and tincture of the blood, and partly some of the relicks of the I cteritious humor, which maketh the vrin of so high a yellow. The spirit of blood therefore with his agent lurking in the tincture, and salt, which is in the watery serous, or whaiey excrement, and being buried in that medicinable earth, or ashes, in which the salt of the plant dwelleth, or stirred vp by the continuation which it hath with that spirit of life, which yet dwelleth in the sick mans vaines. Therefore the water being inhumed and mingled, with that medicinall earth, and mixed with saphron, the viuifying spirit of the sick, tending to the preseruation of life, doth ayd the like in the vrin, and also exuscitate and reuiue that in the salt of the ashes, to act and fight against the Icteritious humor in the vrin, which fading and being by little and little conquered, maketh his

like in the sicke body to dye and vanish. Besides all this, the spirit lurking in the salt, and exuscitated partly, by the excited spirit of the plant, and partly by the emanating spirit of the sicke body, doth send, or carry backe a curatiue property, vnto the whole bulke of the blood. I leaue this vnto the more serious consideration of the learned, who can better iudge of the hidden and abstruse operations of Gods incorruptible spirit, closing vp a-l in these very words of the Apostle: Deus operatur omnia in omnibus, God worketh all in all, &amp; 
                     1 Corinth. 12 
                     ex eo, per eum, &amp; in eo, sunt omnia, of him, by him, in him are all things, &amp; Deus viuificat omnia, God viuifieth all things.

                        ne Lord Iesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. Ergò, it is vainely, and presumptuously said of Mr. Foster, that the cure of the weapon-salue is effected by the diuell, the enemy of Iesus Christ, and not by Christ himselfe, being that Iesus is the only Sauiour, and curer or healer both of soule &amp; body, who, as he hath all powers &amp; potestates vnder his dominion, vseth his good Angels to work his goodnesse, and not the bad Angels, which hee did ordaine for a cleane contrary office. I will not say, that this assertion of his is a kinde of blasphemy; but it is little better. At the leastwise it is the grossest sort of Idolatry, to ascribe the good works of God, vnto the essentiall act of the worst and most wickedest of all his creatures, whom God instituted for a clean contraryvse, namely,

to be his punishing and destroying minister or angel.
                  Now, I will proceed vnto the particular defence, of mine owne doctrine, expressed in my mysticall Anatomy, Against the which Master Foster doth enueigh so bitterly, and with so great a confidence. He crowes there like a Cocke on his owne dunghill, before hee hath occasion, and challengeth gloriously the palme, and proclaimeth the trophey of his owne prayses, before he hath got the victory. The end crownes all: for truth is not boulstered vp with high and braging termes. It had beene best for Master Foster to haue heard me speake, before hee had publikely slandered me, and set vp the Titles of his booke on the posts of my doore in my disgrace: whether it was discreetly done of him, or not; I leaue it to the censure of the world: and so I moue to the last Member of this Treatise.
               
            
            
               
               The Third Member:
               
                  Wherein the Author doth disannull all those Arguments and Obiections, which M. Foster with such inuincible confidence hath produced, for the refelling of his opinion; expressed in his mysticall Anatomy, where he proueth, that the action of curing by the WeaponSalue, is meerely Naturall; and no way Magicall or Diabolicall.
               
               
                  The Prelude to this Member:
                  
                     Wherein the Author doth expresse, that his Aduersaries slanders of him, are grounded on malice, and not on any 
                           •…
                        ust desert of his. Here also he sheweth the method of his proceeding in this Member, with the Reason thereof.
                  
                  
                     EAch discreet Reader may discerne by M. Fosters scandalous vehemency against mee, for composing in my mysticall Anatomy, the subiect of this Member, that it is more of enuy and malice, then for any desert in me, or offence committed by me, either against him, (for as much as I know him not) or any other person else: For out of doubt, he would not else vpon so slight an occasion, as was this short chapter expressed in the foresaid place,

haue so slandered me, with the title ofa Magician, as he hath; and alledged his wise Master the Frier Mersennus his authority for it, as profound an Author for rayling and false slander as himselfe. But why (I beseech you) should he induce Mersennus his scandalous words against mee in this his writing, when he seeth, that the Frier is so taunted by his friend and champion Gassendus for it, that in his Reply, which he maketh with Gassendus and Lanouius against me, after that I had thorowly nettled and gauled him for his follies, hee dared not to vtter or repeate one word against me, touching the precedent slanders of Magicke, which in his Booke on Genesis, vpon little or no ground hee laid vnto my charge; but grafted all his spight and malice in that Reply, vpon certaine Impieties, (as hee termeth them) which hee most weakely layeth vnto my charge? Againe: whereas this our home-bred Aduersary saith, that I haue excused my selfe from Magick, in a Booke intituled, Sophiae cum Moria certamen, and that Lanouius saith, Cuius contrarium verum est; I must tell him, that it doth ill become a man of his Profession, to vtter such a falshood. For Lanouius, (though in as malicious a manner as he could) doth cleare me of that crime, alledging that mine vnskilfulnesse or insufficiency in such things, made him to thinke the contrary. And therefore I must tell this my English calumniatour, that there is a Starre-chamber to punish such abuses, and consequently, he may perchance heare of mee sooner then he doth expect, vnlesse hee bridleth his slanderous tongue the better hereafter. It is an Argument

of little Philosophie, and lesse Diuinity, to rayle vnreasonably, and scandalize with immorality. For Philosophie is Sapientiae amor, the loue of Wisedome: and the Wise man saith, It is the part of a foole to rayle. Againe: all Diuinity is founded on Loue and Charity; and Christ his chiefest preaching, wasto loue our Brethren, and to affect our Neighbours as our selues, and to admonish vs, that wee iudge not our Brethren rashly. But to come vnto our businesse; Hath this Chapter of mine, (iudicious Reader) in which our diligent Inquisitor hath made so strict a search, and against which he hath framed so punctuall a confutation, any Cacomagicall busines in it, that I should so hardly be censured, by our quick-witted Confuter, at the very entrance into it? Doe you discerne in it any thing, that should cause our Aduersary to make such a scandalous, and vnchristian-like ingression into the inquiry of it, that thereby the simpler sort of men may deeme me a Witch or Magician? As for such as are of the wiser sort, I am sure they laugh at it. But is not this an argument of enuy, founded on no solid foundation? And is not he, as well for his vnreasonable spight, as some things else, of each good Christian to be pittied? For what hath he in him should deserue enuy, being that he confesseth in his Epistle to the Reader, that he is infra inuidiam? As for my selfe, I must ingenuously concurre with the opinion of all the world, and say, that I had rather be enuied then pittied. But to our purpose: The subiect of this Chapter cited by me in my mysticall Anatomy, is onely a

discourse of the naturall reference, and Magnetick or attractiue and sympatheticall relation, which is obserued to be, betwixt two distinct substances of the like nature; but differing in the distance of place; as betweene the Loadstone and the Iron, betwixt the blood, and the salt of the same nature; in which the vegetating spirit, common vnto them both, doth occultly abide. And you must note also (courteous Reader) that in this particular Booke of my mysticall Anatomy, I did handle the secret and hidden properties of the spirituall or internall blood in the externall, citing therewithall, as neere as my small capacity would giue me leaue, the harmonicall effects which it worketh, as well by contract or immediate touch, as at a distance. I would faine know now, wherein I haue offended in so doing? or how I haue deserued M. Fosters slanderous ingression into his examination of this businesse? or whether in my naturall discourse vpon this subiect, I mention Diabolicall Charmes, Circles, Witch-craft, or vnlawfull and forbidden Characters, or such like? If you finde nothing appertaining vnto any such deuilish Magick, then giue your sentence, whether such a Prelude vnto this businesse was honest, decent, or any thing appertaining vnto the matter in handling. As for the vsage of the Weapon-Salue in it selfe, I protest before God and man, I neuer of my selfe did practise it vnto this very day; but in my conscience, and by reason of a more strict inquiry, which for this cause I haue made into it, I finde it so free from any Diabolicall superstition, (which, God is my witnesse, I haue

euer hated, as I doe the Deuill and all his workes) and haue heard so much of the vertuous operation thereof, that from henceforward, malegree the demeure writers or speakers against it, I will both practise it, and defend the lawfulnesse of it, as being more assured now then euer, that it is the blessed vertue of God; and not any act of the Deuill, which operateth in it vnto the health and alledgement of Gods afflicted creatures.
                  But to come vnto our matter.
                  I will make but few words, for I haue already beene too long in my precedent discourse. But before I begin, I pray you obserue (gentle and iudicious Reader) how that our Sponge-carrier, is very halting and vnperfect in the interpretation of my text, straining it much from its true nature, to serue his owne sense rather, then iustly to expresse mine intention; (as indeed he ought:) I will therefore in the fi

                     Heere it is proued against our Aduersaries Assertion,
                     First, that the Blood, Fat, Flesh, and Bones of a dead Man doe participate with that Balsamicke nature or humidum radicule which is in the liuing Man.
                     Secondly, that a Horse hath a Balsam sympathising with that of a Man.
                  
                  
                     My naked text Englished.
                     We see that this Oyntment is compounded of things passing well agreeing vnto mans nature; and consequently, that it hath a great respect to his health and preseruation, for as much as vnto the composition thereof, wee haue in the chiefest place or ranke Blood, in which the power of life is placed. Here, I say, is the essence of mans Bones growing out of them, in forme of Mosse, termed Vsnea: here is his Flesh in the Mummy, which is compounded of Flesh and Balsame; here is the Fat of Mans Body, which concurreth with the rest vnto the perfection of this Oyntment. And with all these (as is said) the Blood is mingled, which was the beginning and food of them all, for as much as in it is the spirit of life, and with it the bright soule doth abide, and operateth after a hidden manner. So that the whole perfection of Mans Body, doth seeme to concurre vnto the confection of this precious oyntment. And this is the reason, why there is so great a respect and consent, betweene this Oyntment, and the Blood of the wounded person. For it is most necessary, that some of the Blood of the wounded, be drawne out from the depth of the

This is the exact interpretation of my text.
                     Now yee shall see what he maketh of it.
                  
                  
                     M. Fosters Collection.
                     Scull-mosse, or Bones, (saith Doctor Fludd,) Mummy, and the Fat of Man (the especiall ingredience) comprehend the corpor all perfection of man, and so are apt to heale, by reason of a naturall Balsam resting in them, sympathising with the hypostaticall Balsam refiding in the liuing Man.
                     You see here, that first he leaues out the blood, which is the prime ingredient; and then whereas I speake of that enbalming ingredient, which the Nobles of Aegypt were wont to make of the naturall Balsam, and such like Bituminous and vnctuous things, as were enemies to Corruption, he nominates and interprets after his fashion, and to serue his turne, saying; that I speake of the naturall Balsam in Man, residing in the Oyntment, &amp;c. But I will let him haue his scope, being it cannot much vary from my purpose.
                  
                  
                     M. Fosters Sponge to wipe away this mine Assertion.
                     I deny that Scull-mosse, or Bones, Mummy, and Mans Foster. Fat haue, though they be medicinable, any naturall Balsam, or radicall humor, (for so some call naturall Balsam) residing in them, sympathising with the hypostaticall Balsam, remaining in the liuing Man: vnlesse a Horse haue a Balsam sympathising with Mans. For (saith D. Fludd, which I aduise him to remember) if a naile which pricketh a Horse, be put into the Oyntment-pot, the Horse shall be cured. I say there is no such sympathy betweene Horse

and man; and if there be no cause at all to bele

                           •…
                        ue the other.
                  
                  
                     Here the Sponge is Squeesed.
                     Obserue in the first place, that our Opposite forgets, Fludd. that Blood is one of the ingrediences. And then he disputeth ex non concessis, as is before said; and yet neuerthelesse I will giue him his way, and proue that all which his Spongy tongue hath vttered, for the wiping away of that truth, which hath bene here expressed by me, is of no validity, nor yet of any appearance or probability. I will therefore diuide this Confutation of his into two Branches or Members: whereof the first shal produce this question: namely, Whether Blood, Flesh, Fat, &amp; Bones, haue any naturall Balsam, or radicall moisture residing in them, sympathising with the Hypostaticall Balsam remaining with the liuing Man? The later containeth this: Whether a Horse haue a Balsam sympathising with the Balsam of Man?
                     
                     The first of these two, is flatly held by M. Foster negatiuely, and I in a surer confidence doe hold it affirmatiuely, and will proue it: first, by Naturall Reason: secondly, by the Authority of Holy writ: and lastly, by Common Experience.
                     In the first place therefore, I would haue M. Foster to learne, what a Balsamicke nature is, before hee thus rashly seeketh to censure the creatures to haue it, or to bee without it. I must therefore let him know, that it is nought else, but a volatill, and essentiall salt, that is full of vegetating and multiplying vertue, which it receiueth from aboue, as a

precious soule to viuifie and animate it, the which vertue is that Calidum innatum, or Naturall heate, by whose vertue euery creature doth exist, and the volatile vehicle, in which it is carried, is that Humidum Radicale, or Radicall Moisture, or Humidity, by which, and in which, the foresaid vertue doth immediately moue, and act vnto life, vegetation and multiplication. By the operation therefore of these essentiall actiue and passiue, Vegetables and Animals doe manifestly, and Minerals occultly vegetate and multiply: and that as well in their forme or naturall fire, as in their substance. And for this cause the true Alchymists do cal this mystical Salt, Sal Sapientûm, the Salt of Wise men, for as much as in it consisteth the mystery of Nature. And others tearme it the true Balsamum Naturae, or Balsam of Nature, in which all the Mystery of Nature doth consist. Whereupon the wise Philosophers affirme: Quod sit in sale isto quicquid quaerunt Sapientes: That all that Wise men seeke after, is in salt. Touching the aëriall part, it is the volatile salt, which is euery where expansed in the open ayre, and it is the purest essence of and in the ayre, in which the graine of life is: and therefore other Wise men say, Est in aëre occultus vitae cibus: The hidden food of life is in the ayre, &amp;c.
                     
                     It is not without a very mysticall and secret cause also, that our Sauiour Christ tooke an especiall notice of Salt. In one place he saith: Sal Terrae estis vos, 
                        Mat. 5. 
                        Ye are the Salt of the Earth; where hee meaneth the spirituall man, in which is the breath of life. And againe: Sal si euaneurit, in quo salietur? ad nihilum valet 
                        Ibidem.
                        
                        vltra, nisi vt mittatur for as, &amp; conculcetur ab homini
                           
                              •…
                           us. If the Salt shall vanish away, with what shall it bee seasoned? It will be of no further value, saue onely to bee cast cut of doores, and to be troden on by men. Whereby it is euident, that nothing can exist, or be of any reckoning or estimation, without this Mysticall Salt, or Glew of Life, but will be quite dead and corrupt. There is Salt in the very dunghill, that giueth life and heart vnto the ground, whereby it multiplieth the Graine in a greater proportion, and sucketh vnto it more plentifully the Celestiall influence of life.
                     To conclude: the very essence of the Animall creatures blood in generall, consisteth in this Balsamicke Salt. By it the body is animated: by it the flesh through apposition, vnion, and agglutination of parts is viuified, multiplied, and successiuely preserued. By this in the bread, and the flesh of creatures, the blood in man is daily increased: in this therefore is the incorruptible spirit of life, which keepeth man aliue, and defendeth him from corruption: and vnlesse it acteth his viuifying office, man is quickly rotten or corrupted. Doe not Scriptures confirme thus much in many places
                           •…
                         namely, that, Anima ominis est insanguine: That the

                        life of man is in his blood: and, Anima carnis est in sanguine, The life of the flesh is in the blood? Now it is certaine, that this viuifying Spirit, which is, Donum Dei cuilibet Creaturae, The Gift of God vnto euery Creature: (as is proued before) is the true operator, in this his Radicall moist Tabernacle, to heale, mend, and agglutinate wounds, being assisted with any

application, made either by a Reall, or Virtuall Contact. It followes therefore, that this Spirit being in the Blood, Fat, Bones, and Flesh of Man, for as much as they doe subsist by it, and were first animated, and engendered, and multiplyed by it, doe participate of this Spirit, which the Scripture saith, doth animate and heale all things. Spiritus seu Verbum Dei, saith SALOMON, sanat omnia: The Spirit

                     But M. Foster will say, that this Spirit of life is in the Blood, Fat, and Flesh, when it is not separated from the liue Man; but after it is separated, it hath no more life or being. I haue told him, and proued the contrary, in my Philosophicall Demonstration. For without this Salt, and liuing Spirit in it, neither Blood, Fat, Bones, nor Flesh could subsist; but according vnto that of Christ be
                           •…
                        ore mentioned, it would be of no vse. Againe, it is intimated in Holy Writ, that the Spirit of life is in their centrall or inward parts, though it doth not act or operate; but quiescere in Centro, rest in the Center, as I haue before expressed plainely. For else why should it be said: Thou shalt altogether forbeare to eate the Blood 
                        Leuit. 3. 
                        and the Fat: And againe, Thou shalt not take in thy

And againe it is said: The Soule of the flesh is in the blood. Now if the Spirit of life did vanish out of the Blood, Flesh, Fat, and Bones, immediately after their separation from the liuing creature, what needed all these words, or

strict precepts, for the not eating of the Blood and Fat, after the death of the creatures? Or why should that reason be giuen, Because the soule or life is in the blood, or the blood is the see
                              •…
                           e of the soule or life? The text doth not say, The Blood was the seate of the soule or life; but, It is: namely, the subsistence of these parts, though separated from the liuing body, doe yet participate with the Spirit of life; therefore beware, that you eate it not.

experience hath made manifest, that the Volatile Salt and Oyle of the Blood, is an excellent Cordiall. Againe, that the Oyle of Mans Fat is a great appeaser of the Gout and other Dolours, and a healer of Wounds, and a present dryer vp of all manner of Excoriations; often experience hath taught, as well my Masters as my selfe. Doe we not see, that the dropping of a Candle will in one night heale vp an Excoriation? And euery Ostler will certifie you, that a Horses heele being wounded or cut with a stone or shoo, with the anointing of a Candles end; that Hogs-grease, Deeressuet, are esteemed good and necessary ingredients for a healing Salue; there is not a Chirurgion but will confesse. And whence doth this sanatiue property in them proceed? what? from the benigne act of God, or from the Deuill? If from, it is from that curing and viuifying Spirit, which first made those Members, and gaue them that vertue, or it could haue no healing property. Spiritu ab ore Dei 
                        Psal. 33. (saith Dauid) omnis procedit virtus: From the Spirit of the mouth of God proceedeth all vertue. Ergò, from that Spirit had the Fat, Flesh, Blood, and Bones, that vertue of healing, or not at all: and by the presence they hold still that vertue of it, euen after their separation or amputation from the liuing body, that it receiued from it, whilest they were Members in the liuing Body: onely this is the difference, that when they were in the liuing Body, their vertue was actuall; but being separated, it is onely potentiall, and will not be reduced vnto act, vnlesse it be incited by the

                         viuifying and actuating

Spirit, euen as we see, that Grease or Tallow is fixed with the cold, and will not flow, but with the act of naturall heate or fire, it will forthwith melt and flow. What of all this may our Sponge-bearing Author say? Must therefore the Spirit of life be in this? for without it there can bee no sympathising betwixt this and the Hypostaticall Balsam, residing in the liuing Man. I must haue this Inquisitor know, that as it was but one Spirit, that was called by the Prophet from the foure Windes, to Er. k. 37. breathe life vnto the slaine; so there is but one Spirit that giueth vertue, as well to the liuing Blood, Flesh, Fat, and Bones, as to the other, that seeme to vs to be without life, or in puissance to act. It is but one Spirit, but in diuers properties, that congealeth, and as it were, killeth the Spirit of the moueable Element of Ayre, and fixeth it by his Northerne blast into Snow, Frost, Ice, and Haile; and againe reuiuifieth it by a Southerne blast. Neither will it serue our Opposites turne, to exclude this Spirit from the Fat, Blood, Flesh, and Mosse of Bones, that are in the Oyntment; for the Wise man saith; That the incorruptible Spirit is in all things: Ergò,

                           . 12. 1. in this Oyntment. We haue therefore the Balsamick Salt in all of these ingrediences, and in that Salt lurketh the actiue Vertue, which being stirred by his fountaine of action, flowing and acting à termino à quo, doth reagere, or act againe, à termino ad quem, that is, from the end to the beginning. This is the reason that this Oyntment cureth not onely by a Reall; but also Virtuall Contact: namely, by reason of that vertue, which it holdeth

from his first Creator: As who should say, that an herb or roote should lose all their sanatiue vertue, because they are gathered from the plant: namely, a Graine of Wheate, or an Apple, gathered from the Straw or Tree, should haue no Balsamick nourishment in it, because they are now past growing; and yet the contrary is manifested, in that they haue still in them their vegetating and multiplying Spirit. For being put into the Earth, the very Atom of life lurking in them, doth manifest it selfe, and maketh them grow againe and multiply in their kinde. Neither are the flesh of Beasts destitute of their nourishing property; though they seeme dead, and are seuered from the liuing Creature. For the Scripture saith; Anima carnis est in sanguine: The life of the flesh is in the blood, which if it were not so; it would not nourish, or bee conuerted into mans bodily substance: namely, Blood, Flesh, Fat, and Bones: as also, if the viuifying Spirit did not lurke in the flesh of the dead Carkas, it were impossible that it should be conuerted into wormes by the exposition of it vnto the beames of the Sunne, as shall be told hereafter.
                     Lastly, I could shew this deepe Philosopher, that this viuifying Spirit, in the volatile Salt, is abundantly inbred. I could shew him ocularly, how it sucketh downe the forme of life from the Sunne; insomuch that of a cleare aëriall volatile Salt, as white as Snow, or chrystalling vnctuous fluent liquor, it wil in few houres become as red as a Ruby, by exposing it to the Sunne-beames. Such is the sympathy betwixt it and the forme of the Sunne:

and in the selfesame kinde is their reciprocall appetite; as is betweene the Patient and the Agent, or the Female and the Male. I could shew him also in a short space, the admirable power this vegetable Spirit hath, to cause vegetation in all things. And I haue proued it to be a soueraigne Balsam to cure wounds, and to take away aches: and therefore it sympathiseth with the Hypostaticall Balsam of man. For else it would not be conuerted into the same Image: namely, into Blood, and Flesh, and Fat, and Bones; and much more therefore the very Blood, Flesh, Fat, and Bones, of the selfesame species, being that simile magis nutritur à suo simili, like is nourished more by his like. Doe we not see mans blood; yea, the blood of euery creature, to consist of such a volatile Salt? If it were nothing but the vrine, which is the whayie excrement of the blood, it would witnesse so much, being that it is passing full of salt Armoniak, or volatile Animal Salt: and by reason of the Balsamick nature thereof, mans vrine is so proper to mundifie and cure a slight greene wound; as also the Yellow-Iaunders is cured at such a distance from the patient, as is already declared. You see therefore, with what ease, and that by a triple consideration, this dull Sponge of M. Fosters is squeesed: and how vnreasonable and vnprobable is his foresaid proposition. I come therefore to the examination of the second question which ariseth from it.
                     Touching the second question, which is, Whether a Horse haue a Balsam sympathising with that of man? Master Foster saith, There is no such sympathy
                        
                        betweene Horse and Man. Hee saith much; but proued little or nothing. As who should say, M. Fosters wil is so, and therefore stet pro ratione voluntas, his wil must stand for a law. He imitateth exactly in this, his bragging M. Mersennus. But I wil be so bold as to instruct him better in this matter, and shew him that the bodily nature of the one, doth easily sympathise and communicate with that of the other. For the Flesh, Fat, and Bones of the one and the other, are of blood in a naturall generality; yea, and in speciality of bloods, though in number they vary. For (I beseech you) doth not the selfesame Flesh, Fat, and Blood of the Beast nourish the like in man? Is not the one transmuted into the other? Nay, doth not the Scripture speake this in a generall sense, meaning all blood; namely, that the soule or life of the creature is in the blood, and that the life of all flesh is in the blood, and that for a diuine respect of that Spirit of life in the blood, we are commanded, not to eate of the blood of any creature? And againe: the blood of man, in a reciprocall respect, is to be demanded of the Beast that shed it. All which being rightly considered, who of wisedome can make any doubt, and not absolutely conclude, that the Beasts bodily nature doth sympathise and correspond with the parts of mans body? I confesse, that the Intellectuall nature of man, maketh it to differ from that of a Horse, for as much as he is said to be Animal rationale, and the Beast Animal irrationale; but these properties are onely seene in the specifying spirit, and doe neither concerne or touch any action of life, or vegetation,

or multiplication, or healing. I will therefore discourse in this manner: God hath endued man with a double gift, whereof the first is the spirit of life, which he hath imparted not onely vnto him, but also to all other creatures; and againe, he hath bestowed on him more then on any other liuing creature: for he hath giuen him vnderstanding; and yet the Giuer of this double gift, is but onely one Spirit. And thereupon Iob saith: Spiritus Deifecit me, &amp; inspiratio Omnipotentis viuificauit 
                        Iob 33.4. 
                        me: The Spirit of God made me, and the inspiration of the Euerlasting gaue me life. Now (as I haue said) this very same benefit was giuen vnto all other creatures, in all one property and office: whereby it is said: Deus viuificat omnia, God viuifieth all things. And Iudith: Misit Spiritum, &amp; creauit omnia, He sendeth 
                        Iudith 16. 
                        forth his Spirit, and createth all things: and the Prophet Isaias: Deus dat flatum populo, &amp; spiritum calcantibus 
                              
                                 •…
                              aias 42. 5. terram, God giueth breath vnto the people, and spirit to euery creature that marcheth on the earth. Wherby it is plaine, that the same spirit of life is proportionably, though diuersly, in number, measure, and proportion, powred out on euery specifick Animal: and therefore there must be an admirable sympathy of nature, betweene the parts of each Animal, which are by vegetation and multiplication produced, through the operation of the same spirit of life, infused into the blood; and so by the way of animation vnto the Fat, Flesh, and Bones. And this is the reason, and no other, that like is conuerted into his like; namely, blood into blood, flesh into blood and flesh, and fat into his like, and

bones and marrow is made of both. Is it not most palpable, that any flesh, or blood, or fat of dead Beasts will be conuerted, by mutation of concoction, into the substance of man? which it could neuer doe; but that they egregiously doe sympathise in nature together, and doe vnite the Balsamick nature, or calidum innatum &amp; humidum radicale of the one with the other, and transmute the substance of the one, into that of the other, which originally is the blood, as well manifest as occult. But touching the other extraordinary gift, it is said by Iob in another place: In homine est spiritus; sed inspiratio 
                        Iob 9. 
                        Omnipotentis facit eum intelligere: In man is the spirit of life; but the breath of the Omnipotent maketh him to vnderstand. Vnderstanding therefore is a gift, a part which maketh man to differ from the Beast; but not the spirit of life.
                     What then resteth more to be done? Marry, the 
                        Pag. 39. 
                        Doctor must remember, &amp;c. saith M. Foster.
                     
                     And what must he remember? For so strict an admonition of a wise man, must import some thing of weight. Hee must (saith he) remember his Horseleechery. And what Horse-leechery? Namely, that a Horse pricked with a nayle, may likewise bee cured. A wonderous piece of worke! And was it for this mighty businesse, that the same memoriall should be repeated, in this his glorious Spongy piece of seruice, to wipe that Assertion away? Let vs therefore see the maine subiect of his commenforation, which is this:
For saith the Doctor, (which I aduised him to remember) Pag. 42. if the nayle which pricked a Horse, be put into

the Oyntment-pot, the Horse shal be cured. I say, There is no such sympathy betwixt Horse and Man.
                     
                     Ha, ha, he! Risum teneatis amici? Because he saith so, therefore it is so: stat pro ratione voluntas. Hee sayes it, and though he proueth nothing, yet hee must be beleeued. But this mans Assertion shall be proued ridiculous, as wel by a common and vulgar obseruation, as the manifold practicall experience of the Nobleman or Earle, which I mentioned in the 6. chapter of the 2. Member of this Treatise.
                     Touching the common vulgar obseruation, we see, that the flesh of all creatures (as I said before) be they Birds, or foure-footed Beasts, and therefore of a Horse, is easily conuerted, after it is digested in mans stomack, into his blood, flesh, fat, and bones: which is an euident Argument, that there is a manifest sympathy betweene a Horse his flesh and blood, and that of a man: yea, and that there resideth in a Horse the like Balsamick nature, or Radicall moysture, which is in a man: and that consequently, the same Balsamick nature doth sympathise with the hypostaticall Balsam remaining in man. The case is apparent; for quod facit tale, est magis tale: and therefore if the blood or flesh of a Horse were not of such a nature as that of man, it would neuer be conuerted and made one in vnion, with the blood and flesh of man. But that it is so, euery Sot doth perceiue practically. Whereby it is euident, that the Balsamick nature of the one, doth most exactly agree with the other; or else they would neuer proue so homogeneall, as to include one nature. Againe, if they did not sympathise;

but Antipathise; the nature of the one would abhorre the nature of the other; which experience proueth false. Againe, that there is a Balsamick nature in a Horse, sympathising with that in a man, the effect proueth. For the effect of a Balsamick nature, is to agglutinate wounds, and to incarnate and breed flesh, and that by a secret vertue of vegetation. But the flesh of a Horse doth render his Balsamick suck or iuyce vnto the liuer of a man, where it so sympathiseth with the nature thereof, that it condenseth it selfe, by a homogeneall transmutation into blood, and becommeth as fibrous and well compacted, as the other humane blood: and in conclusion, is made all one with it: and after that by apposition, vnion, and assimulation (that I may vse Galen his owne words) it becommeth mans flesh. An infallible argument, that the Balsamick nature of these two creatures do consent and sympathise: for else they could not make one vnion. Thus our sharp-witted Remembrancer may see, that I doe not onely say, after his fashion; but also proue and demonstrate my case so palpably, that euery simple person may feelingly perceiue it.
                     I come now to such priuate experiments, as the Noble Earle aboue-mentioned hath made vpon Horses: whereof some haue beene pricked, and some wounded, or hurt otherwise. He was pleased to tell me of many of his Cures, as well on his own Horses, as on others, which by the vertue of this Oyntment, hee had performed. Now would I faine know, whether any person of worth or discretion, would rather beleeue that, which this Nobleman

affirmeth, and auowed vpon his owne knowledge, and manifold experience, or else the threedbare assertion of M. Foster, who would perswade the world, and that by his meere asseueration onely, without any other proofe or practice, that Castles may be builded in the Ayre. What shall wee say then? shall we call a conuocation of these turbulent, incredulous, and all-iudging persons, to haue it decided: whether the Deuill did this Cure to gaine the Horses soule, or no? Alas! their demure worships wil, after the due pleading and scanning of the cause, finde that his blacke Lordship would not bestow the paines for a soule, which is so fading, transitory, and not immortall, as is that of a man, after which he so eagerly thirsteth and gapeth. But if they reply that he doth it to delude the credulous Mediciner, and by that couert meanes to gaine his soule: I answer, that, Frustrà fit per plur
                              •…
                           , quod fieri potest per pauciora. The Mediciner cured many reasonable persons before, and would not that suffice the Deuils turne to gaine him; but hee must assist him also, in curing vnreasonable creatures, to make the Obligation for the Practitioners soule the surer? I would perchance giue more credit to these bold and high thundering Iudges or condemners, and vilifiers of Iehouah's power, by attributing that vnto the Deuill, which appertaineth vnto him, if one man had many soules to lose: but who is so foolish to cast the Dice twice, for that he hath surely wonne at once?
                     By this therefore, each wise and iudicious Reader may plainely discerne, that M. Fosters Sponge

is herein also squeesed, for as much as it is most certaine, that the naturall Balsam of one Animal, doth sympathise with his like in the other, by reason that they haue both but one and the same acting vertue, and one generall Balsamick spirit in nature and condition, which is common vnto euery specifick.

same breath affirmeth. For first, hee denieth that Bones haue their aliment from Blood; and then he concludes that they haue. Well, wee will passe this staggering error, and come to the point. Mans Bones (saith he) haue their beginning of the grosser seminary parts, ergo, not of Blood. The consequence is erroneous. For if he will,

                        ucly looke into the nature of the Sperme, he shall finde it to bee nothing else originally; but the purest part of Blood, strained from a double kinde of vessell: whereof the purer or internall part issueth from the arteriall vessell; the grosser and externall from the venall vessell. What needs M. Foster to looke on Bauhines Notes, or Galens Opinions, and those of many other differing from them, and so make Ipse dixit his whole strength, when his eyes will teach him, (if he euer knew Anatomy, as perchance his Father did) that the fountaine of sperme is the Blood, of two natures, namely, Arteriall and venall? for the preparing seminary vessels, that alter it, &amp; purifie it, haue their issues and heads out of the great artery, and vena Caua. Which being so, I would faine know of M. Foster, whether hee thinketh that the spearme doth not proceed from the Blood as original thereof, for as much as the vessels, from which it floweth, be full of nothing else but Blood? I care not for ipse dixit, when in euery mans ocular experience it appeareth the contrary. For some men will haue the substance of the seed to come from the braine; and other some from the subtile parts of the whole body; and some will haue it spring from the purest part of the foure humours, which is

all one to say, that it proceedeth from the Blood, which is composed of the foure humors, though the element of ayre hath the dominion. But most sure it is, that the Blood is his fountaine, and appeareth by ocular demonstration. Which being so, I pray you good M. Foster, what error is it in me to say, that Blood is the beginner of Bones, when your selfe doth confesse, that their immediate being is of sperme, whose immediate existence is of Blood? Againe, we are taught that the

                     To conclude: it is euident by this, that the viuifying Spirit of the Lord (which is the animater of the foure Windes, from whence the Prophet Ezechiel called it to animate the slaine) moueth and operateth radically in the spirituall Blood, and that the sperme is animated and moued by this spirituall Blood, which is the spermes internum, which Philosophers call semen; in whose Centre the viuifying Spirit of the Lord acteth: and then this Spirit in the seed, framed Skin, Flesh, Bones, &amp; Nerues, and giueth them Life, Action, and Motion: all which the patient

Whereupon it is euident, that God operateth all, beginning radically

in the blood: and for this reason the Apostle saith rightly: In him we liue, we moue and haue our being. 
                        Acts 17.
                     
                     I conclude therefore; that here againe is all the Sponges validity so squeesed out, as hereafter (I hope) it shall not be able to digest any great matter; nor yet to bite any longer vpon the Marble Rocke of Truth.

                     Here you see that this fresh-water Souldier hath Fludd. nothing to maintaine his Tenent, but Ipse dixit. If that faile, farewell all further expectation.

But I will proue, that this his and his Masters assertion is erroneous, by three manner of wayes: namely, first, by Philosophicall reason: for being that euery amputated creature, euen from the liuely stocke of his growth, is filled with a Balsamick Salt of the nature of the Tree or Plant, from which it sprung, by which it doth exist, such as indeed it is, it is not possible, but that it should haue of the spirit of his wonted life in it, although it doth not act, but rest in its Center.
                     Next, by Holy Scriptures, for (as is proued abundantly before) the blood spilled, and flesh killed, is full of liuely spirits, though they remaine potentially in them; or else why should the Israelites be commanded, not to eate the fat and blood? For it is said: because the blood is the seate of the soule or spirit of life. For if that spirit of life were fled from it, what sinne had it beene to haue eaten it? But the text saith, for it is the seate of life, and therefore it is commanded, that they should powre it out on the Earth. Againe; let Parson Foster answer this: The incorruptible

                        pirit of the Lord is in all things: Ergò, in the effused blood, flesh, fat, and bones, separated from the whole. And lastly, by common experience; for we finde that fat, and blood, and mummy, haue singular properties of healing, which they could not haue, if all the spirits which they did receiue from the liuing body, were exhaled; but it is the office

Spirit, whose nature is to expell and take away all corruption and sicknesse, and other vnnaturall impediments.

Is it not, I pray you, apparent to the vulgar, that flesh and fat, hung vp in the Sunne, will bee quickly conuerted into liue Wormes or Magats? Which were impossible, except the spirit of life did lurke in the flesh and fat, after the creature was dead; yea, I haue seene a whole dead Crow, which I hung vp in the Sunne, for a certaine purpose, to be wholly (sauing bones) conuerted into verminous animals. An euident argument of the viuifying spirits presence in

the dead flesh, blood, and fat. Yea verily, I haue obserued, that the Balsam of Wheate so aboundeth in it, that if it bee put into Raine-water, in a short space it produceth long Wormes of a white colour. The same effect produceth flesh after putrifaction. It is most certaine therefore, that the spirit oflife is in the dead flesh and fat; yea, and in the graine, which though it operateth not, except it be stirred vp by the viuifying spirits acting property, working in such an organicall body as is the Sunne, the fire, the liuing creature, and such like; yet is it most certaine, that it is in the amputed blood, fat, flesh, and bones, &amp;c. You may discerne by this (gentle Reader) how Casman, and his compleat disciple Foster haue erred. But wee must excuse them modestly, seeing that Humanum est errare. Why, I pray you, should I esteeme these men more Catholick in knowledge then Bernard? But Bernardus non videt omnta. And yet blinde Bayard is subiect to iudge and censure any thing, though vnto himselfe vnknowne. Wherefore let Master Foster put vp his authority in his Pouch, for I esteeme it not, hauing naturall reason, the testimony of Holy Writ, and lastly, vulgar experience, or ocular demonstration to proue the contrary. And whereas his Master Casman teacheth him, that the very Deuill cannot beget or conserue any spirit in them, I wonder how the Deuill then can worke this Weapon-Salue Cure, being that the Oyntment hath no spirits of it selfe; nor yet the Deuill can beget or conserue any in the ingredients thereof?

As if a man would perswade me, that it is not the Load-stone that draweth the Iron; but the Deuill vseth some other creature to doe the deed, to coozen and deceiue the Philosopher or Mariner.

And how in Gods name hapneth it, that the Deuill is become so great a Student in Physick, and doth proue so expert in the art of curing, who hath employed his whole cunning, and bestowed the best fruits of his industry, to play the Kill-cow, and to destroy?

                     Fourthly, I deny that the soule resideth after any hidden Foster. manner in the spirits. The Stoicks indeed held that the spirits were vincula animae &amp; corporis; but the Peripatetick and Diuines deeme this as needlesse, seeing the body is generated for the soule, and the soule created for the body, and both make the totum compositum. What needs there any bonds to fasten them together? There is a reciprocall desire to come together at the first, and an endeauour after the vnion to keepe together. The soule cannot in any kinde depend on, or reside in the spirits her instruments, but the spirits in the soule, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     We squeese once againe in this Argument, this swelling and full-gorged Sponge after this manner:
                     Though in the precedent, I answered sufficiently Fludd. that point; yet must I wring this Sponge a little harder, or it will keepe some of the iuyce of verity in his porous paunch.
                     I said before, that animaesedes was in sanguine, and her chiefest vehicle, was the humidum radicale, as we see, that the Spirit of life in the great world, did place His Tabernacle in the Sunne of Heauen; And againe Psal. 19. Sap. 12. 1. it is said, that the incorruptible Spirit is in all
                        
                        things, but this is that spirit which viuifyeth all things; and therefore it resideth in the blood, and consequently in the spirits, which are contained therein, after a hidden and mysticall manner.
                     As touching the Peripateticks and some 
                           〈◊〉
                         opinion, who hold that it is needlesse, there should be a tye betweene the soule and body: verily that doctrine is most erroneous and false. First, because the soule and body are so contrary in complexion vnto one another, that except an vnion were made betweene the two extremes, it were impossible that they should meet together, or if they should or could meete; yet the pure and heauenly light of the soule, would suddenly forsake the impure and earthly darknesse of the body. For how can duo contraria conuenire in vnum? Doe we not see that all influences from aboue must haue an ayrie Chariot, vehicle or medium, to conuey them into bodies, and to vnite them together? Why did God ordaine and place the Ayre betweene the Heauen and Earth; but to serue as a vehicle to vnite celestiall things with terrestriall ones, quasi amoris vinculo, as it were with the band of loue? Can we haue a better proofe hereof in this typicall world, then that of the Archetypicall? Is not the Father vnited to the Sonne by the Holy Spirit, which Saint Augustine calleth, and many others, Diuinum amoris vinculum: The Diuine tye, or vnion of loue? Now after the Archetypicall image were all things effected, both in the little and great world. For the Prophet saith: By the Word of the Lord the

                        the vertues of them: So that the vertuous vnion or linke, which is made betweene the effects of the Word in whom is life, and the creature to be viuified, is the Good and Incorruptible Spirit, by which tye God hath his essentiall relation vnto the creature. By this Spirit all the discordant elements are tyed in an vnion and louing consent, whereupon it is called Peace, and Loue, and Concord, which beareth (as the Apostle saith) and sustaineth all things 
                        Heb. 1 Iob 26. 9. 
                        by the Word of his vertue. By it, weight and proportion is assigned vnto the ayre, and the clouds are fastened or hung vp in measure, and the waters are tyed so fast in the thicke 
                        Iob 28. 25. 
                        clouds, that they cleaue not. To conclude, in the great World, the Earth and the Heauens are established and linked together by the Word of God, as the Apostle Peter 
                        2 Pet. 3. telleth vs, or else the elements would be continually at warre. And by the same reason the soule and the body, or Heauen and Earth in the little World are linked together, by this intermediate eternall tye, or else the body and soule would neuer abide together, but warre against one another, being that they are as contrary in nature, as fire and water. But vnlesse the spirit of ayre were put betweene these two contrary elements, to ioyne them together, they would neuer agree, nor abide in their spheares: no more would the soule and body, without a spirituall meane. Now as we see, that the Heaven of the great World is composed of light and spirit proportioned, and as it were glewed together, by the eternall Spirit, which is the Infuser of life in them both; so also is the spirit in man so firmely vnited vnto the soule by the spirituall

Word, which is the tye or glew of life, that it is not possible to be separated the one from the other, except it be by that Spirit, which did ioyne them together: And this may easily be gathered out of these words of the Apostle: Viuus est sermo Dei &amp;

                           edged Sword, and attaineth euen to the diuision of the soule from the spirit. Whereby it argueth, that the life consisteth of soule and spirit, and that these two are so vnited together, by the tye of the Word, that nothing but the composer or binder can make any separation of them. And for this reason wee may see, that there is a strong tye, as well betweene the spirit and the soule, as betweene the soule and the body. And therefore as the soule is more worthy then the spirit, so the spirit excelleth in dignity the body, and consequently, the spirit is by proportion interposed betweene the soule and the body, no otherwise then the Ayre betweene the Sunne and Earth. Wherefore it is an absurdity in the Peripateticks, to deny this tye and vnion, and more absurd for Master Foster to make such a poore excuse, as to say, that the body was generated for the soule, and the soule created for the body, and therefore that there needeth no bands to faften them. A poore conclusion (I say) of so eminently appearing a Philosopher and Theosopher: as who fhould say, two extremes could more be ioyned together, without a medium or middle tye or intermediate spirit, to conioyne and vnite them; then the two extremes of a Diameter

in a Circle, without a middle point or Center. And more absurd it is in him to say, that there can be a reciprocall desire of two extremes and contrary opposites to come and dwell together at the

Is it not strange and vnnaturall, that any captiue spirit should not desire his freedome and liberty, especially the bright soule, which is captiued in her darke bodily prison? For this reason therefore Iamblicus saith, that Anima dormiat in corpore humano: The soule sleepeth in mans body. And Porphyrie hath it, That it is alwayes

Whereupon it is certaine, that there is a spirit which keepeth it in this his darke prison. By this therefore you may see, what goodly doctrine this is of Master Fosters! But to mend the matter, he proceedeth thus: And they endeauour after vnion so to keepe together, &amp;c. It is true, if he speaketh in the behalfe of the darke body, who is 
                           •…
                        oth to leaue the bright soule, which is his treasure. But as for the soule, we see how many there are, that to escape the fetter of this prison, doe sluce out their owne blood, or destroy themselues, and many as well amongst the Elect (as by Scriptures we finde it) as among the common Worldlings, desire earnestly of God, as being weary of this World, to be dissolued

and to passe out of this life: Cupio dissolui &amp;

                        esse cum Christo, saith the one, &amp;c. Whereby it is apparent, that the soule doth not desire to liue in the body, or with the body, as Master Foster concludeth. And when she departeth, she cannot leaue her body without the spirit, so firme is their vnion, as the Apostle sheweth, in the text before mentioned; neither can the spirit wholly forsake that relation it hath to the body, as is said. I conclude therefore 
                           •…
                        at against Master Fosters assertion, that the soule doth, with a strict vnion, depend and rely on the spirit, and reciprocally the spirits rely on the soule, no otherwise then the Agent can not be esteemed as an Agent without the Patient, nor the Patient without the Agent. And therefore they must both of them be vnited in one. And consequently, as an essentiall Agent doth act from the Center vnto the Circumference: euen so it is to be conceiued, that the agile soule is contained in the spirits, as the Agent in the Patient, or soule in the body, or lightning in the cloud.
                     And thus farre haue we proceeded, to squeese out all Master Fosters Sponges validity, touching this matter: I come vnto the next.

                     The spirit of the bloodshed, is carried by the ayre (which is the carrier of the spirit of euery thing) vnto his body: this spirit, going by this ayre, in a direct inuisible Line, carrieth the sanatiue vertue, from the anointed Weapon, to the wounded party. For the Weapon communicateth it to the blood fixed on it, the blood to the spirits, the spirits conducted by the ayre, communicate it to the body, and so the Patient is (without application of plaister) healed naturally, &amp;c.
                     
                        
It is plainely and euidently here to be discerned, how he corrupteth my text, to make it serue his owne ends. For first, I make no mention of a streight or direct Line, onely I speake of carrying and direction of the vitall spirits, from the body wounded, vnto the Box of Oyntment, and then of the magneticall attraction of the sanatiue vertue back againe, by an inuisible Line protracted in the ayre. Then he saith, as from my text, that the Weapon doth communicate the vertue of the Oyntment, vnto the blood fixed on it; But I neither said or meant any such matter; for there is a neerer consanguinity betwixt the Oyntment and the blood, then betweene the Weapon and the Oyntment. But I care so little for him and his deuices, as that I will let him haue his will.

(being carried on the swift wings of verity) that in the conclusion of this text, it shall giue you but Iack Drummes entertainment for your reward. I doe not say (good Sir) that as the Sunne-beame is a true Messenger betwixt Heauen and Earth; so the Salue is a Messenger betwixt the Weapon and the Wound; (O admirable capacity of so learned a Gentleman, in his owne conceit to imagine things that are not!) but I say, that as the Sunne-beame is a Messenger betwixt Heauen and Earth, so is the beame of the viuifying and incorruptible Spirit, in the inward man, which is his Heauen, vnto the blood, which lyeth hid in the Oyntment; no otherwise then the graine of Corne in a good and fertill earth, receiueth the viuifying comfort of the Sunnebeames, by which, after putrifaction of the graine, it doth, by a magnetick power, draw the little soule, now at liberty, vpward towards his Fountaine of life, from whence it descended the yeere before, for the multiplying of the graine. But because it is hindred by his elementary body, it remaines houering in the ayre, and by sucking down from aboue more of his like, it multiplyeth from one graine vnto a great many. Is it therefore impossible, that the like might happen betweene the beame issuing from the body, and the corrupted blood in the Oyntment, the small Atome of life, by 
                           〈◊〉
                         of the dead blood arising, and without impediment of his vnctuous earth, sucked by little and little vnto his Fountaine of life? But because all this is liuely expressed in mine answer vnto the very selfesame obiection, made in the first

and second Chapter of the second Member of this Treatise, I will refer the Reader vnto those places, where he shall finde all the Contents of this his insufficient Confutation answered, his Sponge thorowly squeesed, and all his rancor and venom pretended against this my Text, quite crushed out, and annihilated.
                     Then he proceedeth thus: The Sunne is called quasi solus, as bauing no peere, no creature working like it; but the Doctor like another Archimedes, &amp;c. Good Master Parson, semper excipio Platonem. That incorruptible Spirit, which (as the Sonne of Syrach telleth Ecclesiastic, 1. vs) was created before all things, must be excepted. Doe you marke this, Sir? For I told you, that your Sponge, in the inquisition of this text, would haue but Iack Drummes entertainment. I hope you will not preferre the visible Sunne, either in glory or actiuity, before this Diuine Spirit, which giueth it glory and actiuity. What? The creature before the Creator? The matter before the forme? The Patient before the Agent? Is this Master Parsons good diuinity? Or doth Philosophy teach him thus much? Whatsoeuer Tully telleth vs, that this is reuer â solus in mundo actor. It is certaine, that it Psal 19. was this Spirit, which put his Tabernacle in the Sunne of Heauen, and by it only the Sunne liueth, moueth, and operateth, here below, and there aboue; and it is one and the same Spirit, which imparteth vnto all creatures, and consequently vnto vs men, the spirit of life, by which we liue, moue, and haue our being. 
                        Acts 17. It is he, that hath reciprocally put his Tabernacle in man, as well as in the Sunne: and therefore are

No verily, I will not be so bold, to ascribe vnto my selfe, that which belongeth onely vnto God my Creator: howsoeuer Master Foster would ascribe it to the Deuill.

                     That there is such a sympathy betwixt the blood in the body, and the blood drawne from the body, it is most euident by the example of witches. The Deuill sucketh blood from them; this blood remaining with the Deuill, participates of his maligne nature, and hauing recourse by the spirits thereof, vnto the Witches body, maketh all their blood sympathise with that the Deuill hath, and so the blood changeth the Witches nature, and they become maligne and Diabolic all.

                         a ground of his Argument, which neither true philosophy, nor orthodox Diuinity will giue vs leaue to assent vnto. The Witches blood remaining with the blood-sucker the Deuill, sympathiseth with the blood of the witches body. How can this be? How can blood, a substance corporeall, remaine with the Deuill incorporeall, &amp;c?
                  
                  
                     Here this his Sponges validity is squeesed out.
                     O wonderous wit of our Sponge-bearer! O light Fludd. and spongy vnderstanding of so weighty a conception! But if indeed Angels (as he saith) were incorporeall, how could meate and drink, a substance corporeal, remaine with the Angels which Abraham entertained? if they were incorporeall, or if they assumed bodies accidentally, could they eare and drinke with them naturally? or was Abraham so senselesse to offer counterfeit shapes, meat and drinke? Surely a man so profound in diuine mysteries, would not haue beene so absurd, as to haue offered them his food, if he had knowne that it would not naturally haue nourished them. The same absurdity might iustly haue beene imputed vnto Lot. Verily, it is aboue the reach of Worldlings to scan rightly, or discouer iustly this doubt. But suppose it be granted, that Angels and Deuils be not corporeall, but spirituall creatures; yet he confesseth elsewhere, that the Deuill can indue and put on an organicall body: namely, of a man, a Dog, or Cat, and consequently those Angels indued humane shapes. I pray you, when a squirt, or syrynge, or boxing glasse draweth, is it the organ, or the spirit in the organ that draweth? Man operateth

not with his body, but with the inward spirit; neither doth blood act any thing of it selfe; but by the occult viuifying spirit, which acteth in it. Mans throat and tongue serue as organs of voyce; but it is the Spirit that acteth. If the Deuill enter into a body, as he did into the Swine, and humane bodies; did he not make vse of the organicall voyce of the Beast, and those men to speak vnto Christ? But it was the spirituall act of the Deuill, which did mingle it selfe with the aëry spirit of the Beast, and man possessed and made it to answer, according to the will of the Agent; so, I say, that by the ayde of the creatures mouth and spirit, which it indued, it did suck the blood; not that the blood in his grosse nature did abide with the Deuill in his spirituall substance; but I say that the spirituall substance in the blood, which participates of ayre, is easie to ioyne and make an vnion, by the contract with that of the Deuill: euen as we see, that Amber, when it is burnt, sendeth forth his spirit, which vniting or mingling it selfe with the ayre, infects it with his odoriferous nature, and so there is an actuall communication made betweene the ayre and the fume, betweene the spirit of the one and the other, betweene a Priuy-house, or plaguy Botch infecting, and the spirit of the ayre infected, the which ayre communicateth also that infection vnto the spirit of the smeller. Againe, doe we not see in one infected with the plague, that first it was a corrupt spirit, which by the virtuall contact ofit, did infect not the blood onely; but the inuisible spirits in the blood? And doe we not

see also, that the same inuisible spirit so infecting, doth inuisibly also infect the inuisible ayre about it; and though it be in part exspired out of the body and blood; yet it hath such communication with the blood; that for all that the inuisible fume infecteth abroad, not leauing neuerthelesse his persecution at home. If therefore the Botch of the Plague in one man (which the Prophet Abaku' termeth the Daemonium, or Deuill of the South) doth infect the spirituall blood of another, it is not the bodily Botch that doth it; but the infected spirit in it: The corporeall Bo
                           •…
                        ch therefore we compare to the body assumed by the Deuill, and the corrupting spirit vnto the Deuill. Wherefore as we see, that after the Botch of the one hath touched the person of another, the spirit easily, by reason of the reciprocall similitude of them, communicate with one another: so, that although the party that hath the Botch, departeth neuer so farre; yet neuerthelesse the malignant spirit 
                           〈◊〉
                         with the blood of the last infected, and conuerteth it absolutely into his malignant nature. Is it then impossible that the spirituall maligni
                           •…
                        y of the Deuill, by a contactuall sucking of the blood, should contaminate with the malignity of his spirit, the spirit of the blood of the party sucked, and leaue it so infected and changed vnto his owne nature, as the venemous spirit of the Plague into a plaguy disposition? Did not the Deuill worke the very same feate with Iudas his spirit, when it was said:

his spirit first, and those spirits corrupted his thoughts or vnderstanding: for without the helpe of a medium, the Deuill being expelled from Heauen, can not attempt the heauen of mans vnderstanding.
                     But to answer Master Foster at his owne weapon, I meane that quick-sented Gentleman, that so soone can smell a Rat; What doth he thinke, that Deuils haue not tenuia corpora? Yea verily: for he hath for it (as he sayeth) authorities of Scripture, Counsels, Fathers, and Schoolemen to confirme so much. But by the way he saith: The Doctor, who impiously attributes composition in God, dare
                              •…
                            falsly attribute corporeity to Deuils. In the first place, M. Foster hath the Deuill the father of lyes for his Foster-father, who can both foster and father vntruth vpon any one. But as I haue said before, the simple Frier Marinus Mersennus saith so, namely, because I auerred, that the Spirit of the Lord filled and animated the heauenly Spirit, Ergò, (saith he) Fludd maketh God a part of Composition, and therefore Master Parson, holding the Friers words as an Oracle, without pondering the sense of the businesse, blundereth out like a Parrat these very words of the Frier: The Doctor doth impiously attribute Composition vnto God. But if I say that God is in composition, I meane it not as a part compounding; but as the sole Compounder in composition. Againe; if he were absent from composition, the word could not be said to be incarnated; nor the Incorruptible Spirit to be in all things; neither could God by the Apostle be said, to be ouer all, and in all.
                     
                     
                        
                        But leauing this paratticall or parasiticall garb: He bringeth the authorities of Scripture. And what are they? Saint Paul hath this: We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against spirituall wickednesse, Foster. or euill spirits in high places. And therefore Christ said: Handle me and touch me, for a spirit hath not flesh, nor bones, as yee see mee haue;

                           But Deuils can not be handled:
                           Therefore they haue no bodies.
                        
                     
                     Here is a stout Argument, because Deuils as 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                           . they are in their thinne aëriall bodies, cannot bee handled: Ergo, they haue not any corpulency. I would faine know of this acute Arguer, what organicall body for speech this spirit had, when hee in reciprocall words and speech did tempt our Sauiour? Doth he thinke that the very ayre (which is the externall of the Deuill as shall be proued) is not a spirituall body, when it may be felt, heard, or vnderstood, though not as flesh and bones? Doth not the Apostle make mention of a spirituall or heauenly and thin body, and an earthly or grosse and thick body?
                     
                     It is most true, that there are some of the Fathers and Schoolemen, who are of opinion, that the Angels are absolutely incorporeal, as Damascene, Thomas Aquin, Denis, and so forth; But there are as many; yea, and more of the learneder sort, who giue a contrary sentence, touching the bodily existence of these spirits, and say flatly, that an Angel is a corporeal substance, and consequently, that Angels may without any error be termed bodily creatures and amongst this number of the Fathers, are ranked Basil, Origen, Gregory, Augustine, Isidorus,
                        
                        Peter Lombard: and of Philosophers, Mercurius Trismegistus, with all the Schoole of the Academicks. And as for S. Augustine, he saith in his Booke vpon Genesis in expresse words; quòd Daemones sunt aërea &amp; ignea animalia: that the Daemons or Angelicall spirits are aëry and fiery Animals, and consequently assigneth vnto them aëry bodies. Againe, he affirmeth in another place, that the Angels had in their creation aëry bodies, to wit, framed and fashioned out of the purer part of the superior ayre, made more apt and proper to act, then to suffer, and hee auerreth that the euill angels were, by reason of their fall, changed, as touching their bodies or externall being, into the nature of the grosser ayre, that they might be the rather made to suffer the torments of fire. And Fetrus Lombardus saith: Angeli corpora, in quibus hominibus apparent, de summo aëre sumunt, solidam
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            speciem ex coelesti elemento induunt, vt humanis obtutibus manifestiùs demonstrentur: So that it is euident, that Augustine and he agree in one. Also Basil doth teach vs, what manner of bodies the Angels haue, when he saith: they are thinne, aëry, and pure Spirits. Againe, Arteplius that wise man saith, in his great Key of wisedome, That the externall of the Deuill is ayre, but his internall is fire. For the which reason he sheweth, that it is easie for him, namely, in regard of his externall or body, to insinuate and communicate with the aëry and bloody spirit in man, and consequently to engender in him hot and fiery diseases.
                     
                     But why should we rely onely (as Master Foster doth) on bare Authorities? I will come vnto plaine Philosophicall proofes, to shew and demonstrate,

that Angels haue soules and bodies, or externall and internall. First, you must know, that if they were Identity, that is, of all one simple formall being, they would be all one in essence with God their Creator, who is called Identitas, or absolute and simple vnity; but for as much as they are compounded of two: namely, of light, which is the beame of God, which they receiue, to informe them and make them creatures, and spirit, which as polished Looking-glasse, receiueth the glory of that diuine light, they are called Alteritas or Alterity, that is, composed of two. And this is most liuely expressed by Saint Denis, when he termeth them Algamatha, that is, most cleare Mirrours, or Looking-glasses, receiuing the light of God. And therefore he defineth an Angel to bee the Image of God, the shewing forth of bid light, a mirrour pure and most bright. And Damascen saith: That they are intellectuall spirits, hauing light (as their soules) from the first Light. And Salomon describing the Prince of all Angels (which

                           slatis Dei: or the brightnesse of eternall light, and a glasse without spot of the Maiesty of God. Whereby it is euident, that the Angels internall, and as it were his soule, is the brightnesse of Gods emanation: his polished or pure aëry internall, is his 
                           〈◊〉
                         body, which receiueth this light. For we must note, That in the beginning Heauen and Earth were made of water,

                        and by water consisting by the Word, as S. Peter speakes. And therefore the whole World was composed of an internall or inuisible, which is the soule or spirit,

animated by Gods Word, and an externall and visible earth and water, which is the body: So euery creature must needs be compounded of an internall or actiue soule, and an externall or organicall receptacle of that soule, which is the body. Is it not apparent, That when the Spirit of the Lord did

                        moue vpon the waters, the water was the Catholick Patient, and the spirit the internall Agent? For Saint Augustine, super Genesim, saith: Spiritus ferebatur super aquas, igneum 
                              •…
                           s vigorem impertiens, The Spirit moued on the waters, imparting vnto them a fiery vigor or vertue, that is, a viuifying nature; So that the spirituall created Catholick waters, were animated by the spirituall increated Catholick breath, and light of life, whose Spirit in euery creature is the Spirit of life, and therefore their centrall soule: and the creature animated, is the body. Wherefore as the purest, and most spirituall part of water or ayre, is the externall of the Angell; so his internall is the lucid act of Gods Spirit.
                     Now I conclude thus: If the externall substance of the Angel be ayre (for either it must be of spirituall water, or else of the substance of God, which is meerely formall, and not materiall) then wee know by the rules of Philosophy, that ayre subtiliated is fire, and againe ayre inspissated is a vapour, a mist, a cloud, and so by inspissation, ayre inuisible becommeth a visible substance; yea, and a bodily vocall organ too, as it appeareth by lightning, the which soule of the cloud, except it haue his cloudy organ, or bodily instrument, will not speake in thunder. We finde therefore out of Holy Writ,

that God is said to speake out of his organic all cloud. And 2 King. 22. Iob. 22. 15. Psal. 104. Psal. 105. 37. Numb. 11. 25. for that very cause, the Text calleth it in one place, latibulum Dei, in another, tigurium Dei, and in another, vehiculum &amp; currus 
                              •…
                           ehoua: so that if leb

                           ua maketh this organicall Tabernacle of ayre, to vtter vnto mortall eares his voyce (as Scriptures in many places doe testifie) it is no sinne to say, that his inferiour spirits haue for their externall bodies, aëry substances, which being granted, what should hinder spirits, by contraction of this their external substances, to appeare when they please visibly, and organically to talke with a person, as the tempting spirit did to Christ? and againe, by an immediate dilatation of the same externall aëry spirit, to become inuisible, no otherwise then a smoake by dilatation vanisheth, or a cloud, or mist made of a compacted, and thickned ayre, doth oftentimes, without the appearance of any drop of raine passe away inuisibly? Was it not strange, that Christ himselfe that had flesh and bones, should appeare etiam clausis ian
                              •…
                           is, and then immediately to vanish? And yet if we consider, that after he was risen, he did put on a spirituall body, euen that body for that cause, could deponere Tabernaculum suum visibile &amp; tangibile, and become by subtiliation and dilatation, as subtile and impalpable, as the voluntie of him, who hath the spirituall body, pleaseth: and so can appeare and vanishat an instant. It is an admirable speculation, to ponder and consider duely, how God worketh in this world by contraction and dilatation, by priuation and position, by darknesse and light, by apparition and disparition, as

we see, when his Spirit moueth from the North; the common ayre is by the contractiue nature of that spirit, turned from inuisibility to visibility, from transparency to opacity, from ayre to Snow, Haile, Frost, Ice: from leuity to ponderosity, from agility and mobility to fixation and immobility. Contrarywise, by his blast from the East or South, the said bodies are altered againe into water, and water into ayre, and ayre into fire, by dilatation, and in conclusion; corporeity terrestriall, into corporeity aëriall or celestiall, hardnesse into saltnesse, grossenesse into subtility, opacity into transparency, fixation into mobility, rest into action, darknesse into light: And to conclude, contraction caused by this Spirit of God, into dilatation, visibility into inuisibility. What shall I say more? If Angels of all kindes haue their externall from the aëry spirit of the World, and their internall act, from this externall viuifying spirit, in whom is the property of the foure Windes (and therefore the Prophet said, Come, O Spirit, from the foure Windes; 
                        Ezek. 36. whereby he did argue, that this one Spirit, as being the essentiall actor in the foure Windes, had the properties of the foure Windes in himselfe, by the which he acted all things, whereupon the Prophet called it from the foure Windes) wee ought not to make any question; but that by vertue of that internall act, and the substance of that their externall ayre, they may contract themselues from a spirituall fiery and aëry inuisibility, vnto a nebulous or watery, yea, and earthly visibility, or snowie or Icie nature: especially the grosse, malignant,

and darke spirits: which by their fall, haue indued the grosser ayre, (as Augustine saith:) and therefore is Satan called by the Apostle, The Prince of the ayre. And this is the reason, that the Deuill, or euill spirits do in their contraction conuert themselues into solid or firme shapes of man or beast, and appeare in touch to be so excessue cold (according to Master Fosters confession) namely, because the spirit by which they liue, contracting it selfe from the Circumference of dilated ayre, into the Center of contracted earth, leaueth the externall or aëry compacted composition chill and cold like Ice. For it is by his emanation or dilatation from the Center vnto the Circumference, that kindleth naturall heate in the externall of euery creature. To conclude against those that affirme that spirits haue no corporeity: It is most certaine, that where there is rarum &amp; densum, thin and thick, there consequently is corporeity either thinne or thicke. For whatsoeuer is in his substance transmutable vnto a thinner or thicker body, must needs bee bodily, though not a visible body. So is a Starre of Heauen called Densior pars sui orbis, that is, The inuisible 
                              •…
                           thereall spirit or thin body of Heauen, thickned into the visible body of a Starre. So also may fire be condensed into ayre, and ayre into water, and water into earth. And againe, that earth may be rarified into water, and water into ayre, and ayre into fire. For such is the naturall rotation of elements. Now the externall of Angels, must be created of the spirituall substance of the higher world, or not at all: according vnto Basils tenor, and consequently it is

bodily, though of a thinner or thicker consistence, according vnto the dignity of the Angell. Doth not also Dauid acknowledge thus much in these words: Qui facit Angelos spiritus seu aëra 
                              〈◊〉

And therefore it is a shame, that such mysteries as these, which are most apparent to the considerant, should by the ignorant bee derided, and esteemed not workes and operations of the Spirit of God, in the common element of the world, but of the Deuill, and so through their blindnesse mistake euill for good, darknesse for light: of which sort of people Esay

                     Thus, iudicious and vnpartiall Reader, you may perceiue by that which hath bene expressed in this Member, how vnable mine Aduersaries Sponge hath beene to wipe away the least tittle of that naturall value and diuine vertue, which in my mysticall Anatomy, I haue ascribed vnto the WeaponSalue. And therefore for all I can see, hee may inuent some more substantiall meanes, then is this windie Sponge (an expresse argument of a light braine or fantastick wit) to subuert a Medicine of so weighty an importance, and admirable power in working. Hee must haue, I say, strong Cable-ropes, in stead of a light Sponge, to remoue the foundation of verity; and yet, I feare, they will

cracke too, before they will be able to draw wise men to beleeue, that the good gifts of healing in this Weapon-Salue, should proceed from the Deuill, and not from God and his benigne mercies, which is the onely giuer of health and goodnesse.
                     And now I must remember you by the way of one absurdity in our Sponge-bearing Author. For he saith first, that this manner of cure is Diabolicall, and afterward hee seemeth to attribute the effect of it vnto the vrine of man. His words are these:
                     Doctor Fludds directions are, that the Weapon be left Pag. 8. in the Vnguent-pot, till the Patient bee cured, and that the wound bee kept cleane, with a linnen cloth, wet euery morning in his vrine. Whether this be a fallacy or no, I commend it to the iudgement of those, who are expert in Chirurgery. For let the Doctor be sure to keepe a wound cleane, and I suppose they will tell him, that it will cicatrize without his Weapon-Salue.
                     
                        To this I answer, that Oportet mendacem esse memorem: it behoueth a lyer to haue a good memory. For Master Foster must remember, that in another place he saith, The Deuill doth secretly apply some other virtuall operatiue Medicine, to cure the wound, and delude the incredulous M
                           •…
                        untebancks, &amp;c. And here he openeth, that the cause of the cure, is the keeping of the wound cleane with the clout dipped in vrine, and applyed not by the Deuill, but by man; saying, That therein alone consisteth the cure, without the Weapon-Salue, and he calleth all the cunning Chirurgic all Artists to witnesse, and verifie his words to be true: which being so, what a Gods blessing is become of the Deuils cunning in this Physicall cure? or wherein can it appeare Diabolicall?
                        
or how doth he apply any thing craftily to delude the incredulous Mountebanks? Oh the wauering of a tottering braine, to forget his argument, and vnawares to eate his owne words!

                     In which this whole Subiect is in few words contracted and abbreuiated.
                  
                  YEe may perceiue (courteous and well minded Reader) by this which is already told you, that although our Aduersary hath attempted, as the Iewes did vnto our Sauiour, to crucifie, or rather smoother in obliuion the truth, as well of the Weapon-Salues operating vertue, as of mine honest endeauours, on the Cacomagicall crosse of slander, and doth offer vnto vs in our Agony, namely, when our reputation lyeth a bleeding, a destructiue or abolishing Sponge, swelling with vineger and gall; I meane, with the sharp sauce of calumniation, and the bitter taste of his vncharitable indignation, in stead of a Christian-like consolation: yea, although (I say) the tempestuous blast of his harsh spirit, hath done his best, to make the reputation of vs both, as it were to suffer shipwracke, and to be cast, like another Ionas, into the troubled seas of this worlds censure, where the sourging billowes of various affections, doe stormingly iustle, and as it were, shoulder and withstand one another. (For since the maxime is: Quot homines, tot sentontiae, how is it possible to please and

content euery man in his humour?) And though the spongie Leuiathan, or proudly swelling and infulting Whale of Master Foster, did swallow for a time, into his paunch of obliuion, the honour and credit of both this Salue, and me for a season; yet (I thanke my God) he hath imparted vnto me the grace, so to squeese and crush this his prestigious Whale, or deuouring Sponge, which is also an ofspring of the Sea, that now it is forced euen so to vomit vp againe that truth, vpon this our coast, not a little infected with the incredulity of this manner of curing, as the true Whale did in times past, the Prophet Ionas, vpon the shore of the misbeleeuing Niniuites; that the infidelity and suspition of such icalous persons, as haue beene seduced by our Aduersaries Leuiathan, or spongie Monster, may the easier be abolished, by making the deuoured truth to be reuiued, and as it were, to shine forth, and rise againe, that by the light thereof, all those darke cloudes, which haue begot and fostered such incredulity, namely, the religious veile of Master Fosters worldly policy, the error of his doctrine, and the healing power, which he erroneously ascribeth vnto the Deuill, may be discouered vnto the eyes of each wise and iudicious Reader, and that the misbeleeuers may with the Niniuites repēt their error, and turne from such Idolatrous inducements, as haue perswaded them, to ascribe the pious and charitable gifts of healing by the Weapon-Salue, vnto the false Prince of darknesse, who through mans error, doth vsurpe vnto himselfe, the title of Prince or Lord of this World, which of right, and

that from all eternity, belongeth vnto the true God of Light, who hath made both Heauen and Earth, and inriched them with all manner of vertues whatsoeuer. But if it shall happen hereafter, that some silly incredulous persons (the appearingly zealous, I meane, without vnderstanding, of which Saint Paul speaketh) shall, like Dogs, returne vnto their vomit: I must then say and confesse, that they doe but according vnto their kinde; and therefore are rather to be pittied then enuied: and consequently our Sauiours Words so vnfitly applyed by our Aduersary in his Dedicatory Epistle, are most aptly to be powred out vnto God for these men: Father, forgiue them, for they know not what they 
                     Luk. 22. 
                     doe. For this cause therefore, I chiefly direct this my small Pamphlet, vnto all such, as are vnderstandingly zealous, and iudiciously learned, beseeching them earnestly, to take this short modell of our disputation, into their more mature or riper considerations, and to ponder euery parcell thereof truely (all partiality being laid apart) in the ballance of their most honest and pious discretions.
                  Let them examine, I say, in their choycest thoughts, and that seriously, whether this Cure proceedeth from that vertuous gift, which God hath imparted in the creation, vnto these his naturall creatures, and continued it in them, by succession of generation and multiplication, through his all-sufficient Word, euen vnto this day, or else from the meere act and assistance of the Deuill, whose property soone after his creation, by his fall became to strike, plague, and destroy, and not to

cure, and proue so great a Benefactor vnto mankinde. Let them consider the words of the Apostle, affirming, that God operateth all in all: and therefore he acteth when he pleaseth, in and by the Deuill, onely to sicknesse, death, and destruction; but not vnto health and conseruation. Obserue the text of Dauid, auerring, that God by his Word did heale 
                     Psal. 107. 20. 
                     such as were struck with diseases, when they turned vnto him; and doth he not by the said Word cure all? yes verily. For Salomon saith: Hee extended his misericord 
                     Wisd. 16. 10. 
                     vnto the afflicted with Serpents, and sent forth his Word to cure them, euen his Word that health all things. But the Deuill is neither God, nor Gods Word; wherefore I will conclude with this in
                     
                        •…
                     iolable Argument:

                        If our mercifull God cureth all things in his benignity, and that by his Word, then the Deuill can cure nothing;
                        But our God, in his mercy and benignity, cureth all things by his Word:
Ergò, the Deuill can cure nothing: and consequently, cannot prestigiously make a shew of curing, vnder the shadow and pretence of the Weapon-Salue.
                     
                  
                  The Maior is euident, because if the Word cureth all, then that superior generality concludes all inferior particularities: and therefore all absolute faculty of curing is exempted from the Deuill.
                  
                     The Minor also is confirmed and strengthned by the foresaid words: first, of the Prophet Dauid: Hee 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 107. 20, 21. sendeth his Word and healeth them, and deliuereth them from their graues, let them confesse before the Lord his

louing kindnesse, &amp;c. Whereby it appeareth, that it was his louing kindnesse, and not his seuerity and vengeance, which by his Word did heale and cure: For he operateth vengeance in his seuerity or destructiue will, by the organ of the Deuill. And then, of Salomon; But the teeth of the venemous Dragons Wisd. 16. 10. could not ouercome thy Children: for thy mercy came to helpe them, and healed them; for neither herb, nor plaister healed them; but thy Word, O Lord, which healeth all things, for thou hast the power of life and death, and leadest downe into the gates of Hell, and bringest vp againe, &amp;c.
                  Now I would know, whether it ought to be any true Christians opinion, that the Deuill can command the misericord of God, and so be Master of his word at his pleasure, as to heale Gods creatures, nay, one framed after his owne Image, for any wicked stratagems cause: I meane, for the gaining of both body and soule of man, from God to himselfe? Iob 12. 11. Doth not Iob say: In the hand of God is the life of euery liuing creature, and the spirit of all flesh? To conclude as Saint Iohn doth truely auerre, that in the Word was life; So it is certaine, that all healing and restoring power, is from this viuifying vertue in the Word, and not from the priuatiue power of the Deuill, in whom contrary wise is death and destruction. Moreouer, I would haue you to note these words of the Apostle: Now there are diuers 
                     1 Cor. 12. 
                     gifts, but the same Spirit, and there are diuersities of operations; but God is the same which worketh all in all; but to one is giuen by the Spirit the Word of wisedome, to another the word of knowledge, to another is giuen faith, and to
                     
another the gift of healing by the same Spirit, &amp;c.
                  Can any good Christian thinke, that this one Spirit, that onely worketh these things, is the Deuill? No verily. For in the third verse, the Apostle termes it the Holy Ghost. What shall we say then? That the Deuill doth heale by the gift of the Holy Ghost? or that the holy Spirit will grant the euill spirit his good gift of healing, to deceiue mankinde, and to rob God of his right? God forbid: But with iustice giue that vnto God, which belongeth vnto God, and assigne vnto the Deuill that property, which was allotted him by his Creatour from the beginning: the first Spirit, from all creations, was ordained in his office to be a good, viuifying, and a quickning Spirit; the latter, a bad, a killing, and a mortifying spirit. For it is said by the Prophet in the person of God: Ego creaui destructorem 
                     Isaias 54. 16. 
                     ad disperdendum: I haue created the destroyer to destroy.
                  
                  I will boldly therefore conclude and finish my Pamphlet, or petty discourse, as I began it, namely, with this religious verse, mentioned in the diuine Hymne of the Royall Psalmist, to the honour of God, and disabling of either Deuill, or any other creature, to worke essentially wonders of himselfe, or by himselfe:
Benedictus Dominus Deus Israël, qui facit mirabilia Psal. 71. 18. solus: Blessed be the Lord God of Israël, who onely worketh wonders.
Or as he hath it in another place:
Confitemini Domino Dominorum, quoniam in aeternum Psal. 135. 3. miser
                           •…

                        ius, qui facit mirabilia magna

solus: Prayse the Lord, for his mercy endureth for euer, who onely doth great wonders.
                  
                  And therefore, if the Lord of Lords onely, or alone; then hath he not any mortall man to helpe him: if he alone; then not any Angel of Heauen: and lastly, if it be God alone, and onely; then not any Deuill of Hell; nor Daemon or spirit of the fiery, or aëry, or watry, or earthly element to assist him. For the text saith: It is the Lord of Lords alone; and therefore not any creature to helpe him, or that is able to doe this without him: it is he (I say) onely; and consequently not the Deuill, who performeth wonders; But by euery mans acknowledgement, this manner of cure is wonderfull, for as much as the manner of working in it, passeth the capacity of worldly mens vnderstanding: Therefore with Dauid I will say:
Benedictus Deus, qui facit tale mirabile solus: and consequently, I may inferre thereupon (and that iustly) Maledictus homo qui diuina falsò attribuit Diabolo.
                  
                  Wherefore I wish euery zealous and religious person, to haue this inuiolable Motto engrauen in his heart, that by the vertue thereof, he may fright away and banish from his thoughts, all such irreligious perswasions, as would moue him to derogate one Iota or tittle from Gods power, who is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end of all things, to arrogate falsly vnto the vilest of creatures, who in himselfe is nothing but what God is pleased that he shall be: of himselfe hath nothing, but what God pleaseth to bestow on him: and by himselfe

can doe nothing: but what God is pleased to act in him, and by him, that he doth, and not any thing else: and therefore, what God will not, that he cannot doe. Let this then be your Motto:

                     Woe vnto them that speake good of euill; and euill of good: which put darknesse for light, and light for darknesse: that put bitter for sweet; and sweet for sowre. Woe vnto them that are wise in their owne eyes, and prudent in their owne sight.
                  
                  I leaue this (worthy and learned Reader,) as I haue said before, vnto thy best consideration, to iudge of seriously and maturely, wishing that in thy iudgement the ballance of equity may be truely proportioned, and not made vnequall by corrupt and vngodly partiality.
               
            
         
      
      
         
            THE EPILOGVE.
            ANd now for a farewell vnto this my small Pamphlet, I would haue my well-minded Country-men to know, that, had not this rude and vnciuill Aduersary of mine, most vntruely and disgracefully calumniated mee, and laid without

any iust occasion vnto my charge, the vn sufferable crime of Witch-craft, or Magick, which is odious both to God and man; I would not thus farre haue hindred my greater businesse, and more weighty occasions, to haue satisfied his v

               reafonable and immodest appetite. And yet, I protest before God and the World, that I am so farre from enuying at his good qualities, (if he haue any) that in the first place. I pitty his indiscretion, and want of that modest and morall wit and behauiour in his writing, which becommeth a true Philosopher, for as much as in them he appeareth more puffed vp externally with the empty blasts of selfe-conceit, begirt on euery side, with the blasted fruit of scandalous detraction and enuy at other mens endeauours, then stuffed internally with any solid validity: Gay things (I say) to breed delight in Babyes, or such as by reason of their darknesse in vnderstanding, can not well discerne or distinguish the colours of Truth: But vnto the wiser sort (such, I meane, as regard with intellectuall eyes) they seeme as Bables, or things which prestigiously appeare vnto dull eyes, but in verity, are plaine nothing: and then in the second place, I wish him with all mine heart, more money in his purse, or else some good Benefice or Church-liuing to stop his mouth, the want whereof, (as it appeareth by his Epistle vnto the Reader) maketh him in his writing; first, so forgetfull of his Creators Omnipotency, that he presumptuously attributeth that, namely, the soueraigne gift of healing, vnto the Deuill, which from all eternity belonged vnto

God: next, he most irreligiously and vniustly doth scandalize his Brethren, for ascribing that iustly vnto God, which only appertaineth vnto him; and consequently, not to any Deuill in Hell: and lastly, he seemeth to inueigh against some men of his owne Profession, yea, and also to murmur against his Superiours in the Church, as you may collect, partly out of his Dedicatory Epistle, and partly out of that vnto the Reader.
            I know his humour so wel, and his Pen hath made me so perfectly acquainted with his rayling and Satyricall disposition, that I expect nothing lesse from him, then a reply full of vnreasonable brauadoes, and thundering exclamations. But although he should rayle and rore at me, as a Bull of Basan, or puffe forth the fire of his spight, and rage like one of the Buls of Colchus, yet shall my still patience serue in stead of another Iason, to charme his tongue, or dull the biting edge of his Pen, &amp; to extinguish the bitter flames of his malice against me. Let him therefore hereafter thunder forth, cry, &amp; proclaime what he please (for such is his vnciuill nature) I will from henceforth answer him (as a rayling and Cynick Writer ought to be,) with silence: for as much as I am assured, that neither by true Diuinity, or authenticall Philosophy, he will be able to vntwist that web of Truth, which this my small Pamphlet hath wouen vnto him: But if he haue some other businesse or subiect that sticketh in his stomack against me (as I haue heard he threatneth me with Mountaines, and I am assured they will proue in the end but Mole-hills, as well as the precedent)

perchance if I finde him in his writing more modest and mannerly, as well become

                one that professeth the name of a Philosopher, &amp; as a Master of Arts ought to behaue himselfe towards a Doctor, who is his Superiour, that is, if he strike hard and defend himselfe closely from being repayed with Theologicall and Philosophicall arguments, and not with misbeseeming termes, foule-mouthed language, and false slanders, as his custome is; he shall finde that I will not refuse or faile him, but will be ready to cope with him in the Philosophicall Campe of Minerua, when and how hee dare; and let him if he will beseech (as Mersennus his Fryerly Master hath done) all his Associats and Cabalists, or Birds of one feather, to assist him in his quarrell: But if he perseuere in his immorall and slanderous veine of writing, I will keepe silence, and either smile at, or rather pitty his folly, and answer all his obiections in mine accustomed Latine stile vnto Peter Gassendus, who is his chiefe Master, and a man that is to be preferred by many degrees, not onely in Learning, and Philosophicall knowledge, before this my home-bred Aduersary: but also in ciuill morality, honest iustice, and freedome from enuious malice. I wish that Master Foster would imitate him, and bee his Scholler in these his vertues, &amp; then I should with the like true Christian affection bestow on him, being my home-bred Aduersary, the same commendations, which reason and vertue incite me to impart vnto Gassendus, although my forraigne Opposite.
