            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            The two faithfull Friends.
            
               The pleasant History of Alexander and Lodwicke, who were so like one another,
that none could know them asunder: wherein is declared how Lodwike
married the Princesse of Hungaria in Alexanders name, and how each night
he layd a naked sword betweene him and the Princesse, because he
would not wrong his friend.
            
            To the tune of Flying Fame.
            
            
               
                  
               
               
                  THe Emperor of Germany,
                  
                  a turney did Proclaime:
                  Where many Princes of renowne,
                  resorted to the same,
                  Amongst the rest Prince Lodowike came
                  and Guido Prince of Spaine;
                  Prince Alexander likewise came
                  great honours to obtaine.
               
               
                  The Emperors promise was to giue
                  to him that won the day,
                  His only daughter as his bride:
                  the Story thus doth say;
                  The Champions entered the field,
                  with carriage stout and bold:
                  
                     Lodowike of France, most manfully
                  whose Armour shin'd like gold.
               
               
                  Prince Alexander was the next
                  that entred in the field,
                  And like a champion stout and bold;
                  he did aduance his shield:
                  The haughty Spaniard with the rest
                  his valour there did show,
                  But Alexander by his strength,
                  gaue him the ouerthrow.
               
               
                  The valiant Prince of Hungary
                  braue Alexander hee,
                  From all the champions in the field
                  he won the victory:
                  Thus he by valour did obtaine
                  the Princesse from them all,
                  But yet in Hungary she liu'd
                  that had his heart in thrall.
               
               
                  
               
               
                  The Emperor his promise kept,
                  and to the Conqueror gaue:
                  His only daughter for his wife
                  whom Lodwicke most did craue;
                  For loue had so inflam'd his thoughts
                  and set his heart on fire:
                  That for to gaine the Princesse loue
                  it was his chiefe desire.
               
               
                  This Alexander was so like
                  to Lodwick Prince of France,
                  That he so lately had or throwne
                  by Fate and fortunes chance:
                  None could distinguish them aright
                  or know one from the other.
                  In shape stature and countenance;
                  as if they had bin brothers.
               
               
                  Which bread such loue betwixt them both
                  as could not be diuorc't,
                  Yet fortunes frowne, and fickle chance
                  Asunder them in forc't:
                  Prince Alexander gaue his friend
                  the Emperours daughter free,
                  Which he before had won in field:
                  by manly Chiualry.
               
               
                  The enuious Spaniard being vext
                  and tortured in his mind,
                  He and the devill deuised how
                  to 
                        〈◊〉
                      these louers kind:
                  He to the Emperor accus'd
                  the Princesse of base Lust,
                  And 
                        〈◊〉
                      with 
                        •
                     ord for to maintain:
                  these accusations Iust.
               
            
            
               
               The second part. To the same tune.
               
                  PRince Lodwick being thus accus'd,
                  by Guydo Prince of Spaine,
                  His friend Prince Alexander then
                  this combat did maintain:
                  And sent his friend Prince Lodwick straight
                  to Hungary with speed,
                  There in his roome for to possesse
                  the high Imperiall weed.
               
               
                  Friend Lodwick, Alexander sayd,
                  goe thou to Hungary,
                  Against the Spaniard Ile maintaine
                  thy cause most manfully:
                  The King I vnderstand is dead▪
                  
                  goe then and in my place,
                  Possesse the Crowne and dignity,
                  and all the Royall grace.
               
               
                  That they will there bestow on thee,
                  let it not be deny'd;
                  His daughter likewise in my name
                  Make her thy wedded bride:
                  But by our friendship I intreat,
                  this kindnesse in thy hands:
                  That thou by no meanes vyolate
                  true constancies chast bands.
               
               
                  Although thou wedde her as thy wife,
                  Yet know tis in my name,
                  Let her remaine a virgin pure
                  I doe request the same:
                  Because my heart she has in hold,
                  and loue her as my life:
                  Away be gone thou knowst my mind
                  leaue me to end this strife.
               
               
                  Prince Lodwike now is on his way,
                  and Alexander hee,
                  By fortunes ayd the Spaniard slew,
                  and set the Princes free:
                  
                     Lodwike in Alexanders name
                  receiu'd in Hungary,
                  The Crown, &amp; likewise in the Church
                  his wife receiued he.
               
               
                  But euery night betweene them twain
                  his naked sword he'd lay,
                  Such constant friendship at that time
                  his heart and thoughts did sway;
                  Prince Alexander came himselfe
                  then Lodwike tooke his leaue,
                  Of Alexander his deare friend
                  which did him not deceiue.
               
               
                  The Queene in heart was vexed sore
                  that she so long should lye,
                  With him that was her husband deare
                  and not Loues pastimes trye:
                  Unto a Lord she made her mone,
                  and they both did agree:
                  To be reueng'd vpon the King
                  and poysoned he should be.
               
               
                  The poyson tooke not full effect
                  but brake forth on his face,
                  That he a leper did appeare
                  and then in great disgrace:
                  They kickt &amp; spurnd him from the court,
                  thus in most shamefull manner,
                  He was compel'd to beg for food
                  that lately liu'd in honor.
               
               
                  To Lodwiks Court he did repaire
                  thus like a leper poore;
                  And for reliefe he did intreate
                  at his friend Lodwiks doore▪
                  
                  A Ring he sent vnto his friend,
                  who well the same did know;
                  And came in loue to greet his friend
                  willing to ease his woe.
               
               
                  Quoth Alexander vnto him,
                  kind friend there is no way
                  To ease my paine vnlesse that thou
                  thy louing babes doe slay:
                  What 
                        〈◊〉
                      but I will doe for thée,
                  quoth Lodwike by and by,
                  To ease my friend of this great paine,
                  my pretty babes shall dye.
               
               
                  For which hee to the cradle goes,
                  where they were fast asleepe,
                  And with a knife he lets them blood
                  his promise for to keepe;
                  And with their bloods he washt the sores
                  from Alexanders face,
                  Thus he like to a loyall friend
                  the path of Loue did trace.
               
               
                  Thus Alexander being clear'd,
                  of all his torturing paine,
                  
                     Lodwike vnto his Queen made known
                  how he his babes had slaine
                  This newes did grieue her at the heart,
                  but straight she runs to see:
                  Whether that it was so or no
                  it prou'd the contrary.
               
               
                  For both the babes she found aliue,
                  as God would haue it so,
                  Which did reuiue her drooping heart,
                  now ioyes excéedes all woe:
                  King Alexander being well
                  to Hungary he goes;
                  And Lodwike his beloued friend
                  to ouerthrow his foes.
               
               
                  The victory they soone obtain'd,
                  and tooke the Lord and Queene,
                  And doom'd them to such cruell deaths
                  as yet had not beene seene:
                  King Alexander againe was Crown'd,
                  by helpe of his good friend,
                  Their griefes to ioyes conuerted were,
                  their pleasures did transcend.
