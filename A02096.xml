            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               Infortunate Moedyna, hath Fame hetherto feared to speake ill of thy thoughts, &amp; shall report now dare to misconstrue of thy actions? hath Greece honoured thee for thy vertues? and shall the whole world at last abhorre thee for thy vanities? shall the Ladies of Ithaca, who alledge thée for a president of chastity, blush when they heare of thy vnbridled fancy?

No Moedyna, thinke this, there is no swéeter frinde then fame, nor worse enemy then report: Princes thoughts as they are royall, so they ought to looke no lower then honor.

                   is what is necessary to the perfecting of a Souldier, which might I with his fauour request, I would cōmit to the charge of Hector: as to him who of his very enimies is counted an exact martialist. Hector, whose thoughts swelling with honor, died his chéekes with the fame of his prayse, willing to auoyde with one blast, both selfe loue and curiosity, made Nestor this answere.
               Although forrayne fauours, are domesticall treasures, and it better fitteth honor, to praise an enemy, then a friend: yet to offer incense to Pallas in the Temple of Mars, were to prophane his deity: and to make mee an instance, Achilles in presence, is to iniure his dignity: report is partiall, and the tip of the tounge soundeth not alwayes the depth of the heart: but let fame fly how shee list: I deny not but I haue dared to beare armour, and to haue pressed amidst the thickest of myne enimyes, therefore I thinke the most requisite vertue in a Souldier, to bee fortytude or magnanimity. I thinke it necessary (quoth Achilles) as Causa sine qua non: for therefore is hee called Siles, for that hee doth, Animam fortem gerere: but yet the couller that giueth the swéetest glose to honor, in my opinion is Liberality: two necessary vertues (quoth Helenus) but yet a more principall poynt then these, which hath made many Monarches triumph without bloode, is Wysedome ioyned with Science. Agamemnon desirous to heare these three discussed at large, thought to incourage them forward in this maner. Wyth so equall a proportion (worthy Gentlemen) haue you made a distinct deuision of the incident properties of

Souldiers, as what is necessary not onely in martiall discipline, but in humaine life, is sufficiently in these thrée comprehended. For wysdome mixed with learning and knowledge, is so pretious a vertue in the lyfe of man, as it behooueth not onely a prynce to haue the possession thereof, for the pollicy of his ciuill gouernment, but also to the performing of his warlike indeuours: Fortitude the fayrest blossome that springes from a noble mynde, is not onely requisite in peace to bew

further replie: Andromache and the other Troian Ladies seeing the sunne declining to the west, desirous to take their leaues hastened Hector from the companie, who with the rest breaking of from talke, after great thankes to his host Achilles, to Agamemnon, Vlisses, and the other Lords, for their sumptuous intertainment, with a request from Polixena and hir sister Cassandra, that the next morrowe they would accompany Iphigenia, Briseis, and Cressida to the City, who had past their promyse to come, they offred to depart. Agamemnon onely making excuse for him selfe, but graunting his consent to his daughter: the other noble men promysed to accompany the Ladies, and for confirmation thereof, after an interchange of courtesies, mounting vppon their coursers, they roade with the Ladies to the very walls of Troy; where after a friendly far
                     •
                  well, they returned to their pauilions. Priamus glad to sée his children so merry at home, began to question with them of their intertainment, which Hector from pointe to pointe rehearsed vnto him, as before, with this addition, that the Gretians ment to dyne with him the next day: wherevpon Priamus made most princely preparation.
            
            
               ¶ The third discourse.
               THe gladsome rayes of Phoebus had no sooner shaken of, by the consent of blushing Aurora, the dusky and darksome Mantle that denied Tellus and Flora the benefits of Tytan, but the Grecian Ladies, and especially Cressida, who all that night had smoothered in hir thoughts the perfection of Troilus, were vp and at the pauilion of Achilles, to waken him from his drowsie nest: whose dreames were but swéete slumbers conceipted by imagination of the beauty of his fayer Polixena: The worthy Captayne glad he had such pretty Cocks to crow him from his dreames, hied

him out of his bed, and with as much speede as might bee, sending for Vlisses, Diomedes, Patroclus, Nestor, and the rest, after a small desiune, for feare of the ayer, they mounted with the Ladies, and trotted on a solemne Pace towardes Troy.
               
                  Hector hauing by his espials vnderstanding of their comming, accompanied with a worthy troupe of Troians, went to méete them, hauing before him vpon white Arabian Coursers three hundreth gentlemen, clad in purple Bisse, their Hats plumed with crimson Feathers, that reached to the Arcons of their Saddles, their Coparisons interpointed with broken Launces spotted with bloode, about the borders w

                  s written this sentence:

                     Hac fortis sunt insignia.
                  
               
               Next to these, Hector, whose countenance threatned warres, &amp; in whose face appeared a map of martiall exploits; framing his collours to his thoughts, was seated on a black Barbarian Gennet, whose furniture was black Ueluet, set with Adamants, interseamed with fluds, wherein were Salamanders bathing in content: there was imbrodered in letters figured with Pearle, this,

                     Sic pro Marte.
                  
               
               
                  Hector thus in his Furniture mette Achilles, and the Ladies, whom after friendly salutations, and a second repaying of thankes for their good cheere, they conducted to the Citty: where they no sooner entred the gate but Hecuba, the stately Troian Queene, attended on by Penthesilea the princesse of the Amazons, hir daughters and other Ladies of great dignity, met them with most royall intertaynment: whom after generally they had saluted, with a particular welcome, they accompanied to the temple of Pallas, where aged Priamus, with six and thirty other kinges his allied frinds, amazed the Gretians with the sight of their maiesty: in so much, that Achilles as a man in a traunce, confessed in his thoughtes, that this citty was Microcosmos, a little Worlde, in respect of the Cytties of Greece.

                  Pryamus noting howe they stoode in a muse, saluted them in this maner.
               Worthy Grecians, whom reueng and thirst of honor hath haled out of your natiue kingdomes, to sacrifice your bloode at the walls of Troy: sith in martiall myndes enmity ought to hange at the Swords point, and thoughtes in maiesty ought to bee measured by promise; A league of friendship being passe for a prefixed tyme, I account our citty a free mart for the Grecians, and your Tents a Sanctuary for the peaceable Troians: which my daughters confirmed by proofe, in hazarding, vpon the othe of an enemy, and you now ratefie, by committing your selues into a walled city, peopled with your professed foes. But honor and maiesty brooking no treacherous suspition, putteth in assurance of safty: omitting therefore all friuolous protestation, the Ladies first, as respecting that once I was young, and the Lordes, as now I am olde: and both as I am Priamus are heartely and vnfaynedly welcome, to the poore besiedged citty of Troy: where if you finde no sights but Armour, no musicke but the Drumme, nor no delicates but souldiers fare, impute it to your owne wilfulnesse, and our necessities, which are forced to beare reueng with fortune: hoping therefore you will measure your intertainement by the time, Followe mee to the Pallace of Il
                     •
                  um.
               The Grecians thanking Priamus for his Pryncely courtesie, paced on to the Pallace, where alighting, and entering, they found all things ready furnished for dynner, so that set downe euery man in his degrée, they fell to such cheere as so sodaine a warning would afford, which was so sumptuous and (to say troth) serued in with such prodygall magnificence, as the Gretians thought Bacchus and Caeres ment there to discouer their superfluity: Feeding thus more with the eye then glutting the stomacke, yet taking their repast with good appetite, they past ouer dynner with many pleasant discourses; which for breuity sake I omitte.

Well, the Tables vncouered, Hecuba and the Ladies went to walke, and to see the pleasures of the Pallace: but the Lordes sat still silent, vntill Priamus began to put them from their muses with these woordes.
               I remember (mighty princes of Greece and Asia) that my sonne Helenus commended the Gretian banquets, to bee more delicate then any other that before hee had seene: his reason was thus; that their fare was not so sumptuous, as their philosophicall discourses were delightfull: so that to spend tyme well, they amidst their cuppes ceased not to learne precepts of morall vertue; so alaying the heate of Bacchus vynepresse, with the sweete conserues fetcht from Myneruaes Library: which as I greatly commend, he discoursed vnto mee your late disputation about the perfection of a souldier, consisting by your distinct diuision, in thrée partes, wysedome, fortitude, and liberalitie: all thrée necessary, but the question which of them is most pretious: the first being discussed bad enough, as I coniec

                  re by the man; it resteth, if with your good fauours I might craue it, that now to adapt a fit digestion, wee might heare the second question decided.
               Aged Nestor seeing they sat all silent, rising vppe, and vncouering his hoary heade, that shyned like the Syluer gleaming Iuory, made him this answere: Mighty Priamus, honorable for thy thoughts, and famous for thy Issus; feared of Fortune, because in resolute maiesty aboue Fortune; the Gretians knowing their discent from the gods, therefore couet in actions to resemble the gods, which they Imagin to doe, by studying phylosophie to be come vertuous: so that they measure their time by pleasures and their pleasures by profit, counting nothing delightfull, which is not both profitable and honest: which inforced vs to intertaine thy sonnes with our philosophicall discourses, to trie if their vertues were onely ingrauen by nature, or perfected by learning. How wee found them, giue vs leaue to reporte in Greece, not in Troy: but so wée estéeme of them,

as wee desire thy highnesse to forward our former disputation; which belongeth vnto thy sonne Hector: namely to discourse of fortitude. Priamus promised to farther so good a motion: and therefore commaunded Hector, sith hee tooke the defence of such a vertue, to maintaine his charge: who duetifully obeying his fathers commaunde, seeing the Princes began to be attentiue, began his discourse in this manner.
            
            
               ¶ Hectors discourse of Fortitude.
               ALthough it might amase Esculapius to alledge any of his Aphorismes in the presence of Apollo, or Silenus to treat of the nature of Grapes in the hearing of Bacchus; yet it is no offence in Pallas temple to treate of wisdome, nor at Venus altars to parle of loues; sith the goddesses doo patronage such affections. So, although the presence of such mighty prynces, whose chieualry is famous from the East to the West, and whose valour by experience is able to deliuer principles of magnanimitie, might affray mee from this inioyned discourse of fortitude; yet, for that my fathers commaunde is a lawe of constraint, which Nature willes mee to obey, and the request of the Grecians such a clayme, as duety forceth mée to graunt; I will rather hazarde my credit on the honorable thoughts of these mighty Potentates, then seeme eyther scrupulous, or froward in gainesaying such a charge, hoping they will with Prometheus, censure well of the workmanship of Lisias, &amp; rather cast an eye at the nature of the stone by secret instinct, then at the beauty pollished by arte; in which hope resting, thus to the purpose.
               The Phylosophers, whose liues spent in metaphusicall contemplation, hauing set downe in their precepts, the perfect

pourtraiture of vertue, figure hir bare counterfait, placed by equall proportion, betwéene two vyces, noting thereby, that the meane kept betweene two extremes, is that laudable action, which by no other name can bee tearmed, but by the title of vertue; neither in excesse, soaring too high with Bolerophon, and so to hasard on the heate of ye sunne, nor in defect falling too lowe with Icarus, by the moysture of the Sea wetting his feathers; but flying with Dedalus, in the meane, so with case and quiet attayning to the desired ende; as for an instance, fortitude seated betweene two extremities, Timiditas, and Audacia; feare fayling in defect, and rashnesse faultie in excesse; the meane being that courage which ought to bee in a Souldier. For all desperate attempts that beare the shadowe of prowesse, and are of the common sorte honored with the name of fortitude, are not comprehended within the precinct of this vertue; for hée only is counted a valiaunt man, that without any furious or rash resolution, feareth not to hasard him selfe in ye greatest perills whatsoeuer, for the weale of his countrey. So that by this definition wee see, that hee limited within the bonds of measure, is not to v

                  ture or make proofe of his valour in euery light cause; yea, for euery trifling thing, but with such proportion, as in scorning death; yet hee may honorably se
                     •
                  ke not to bee counted desperate. For I remember that Isadus a worthy Lacedemonian seeing their Citty besieged, and tha

                  s. So that wee see, there ought in this vertue of fortitude certaine circumstances to be necessary, as how it bee done, where it bee done, &amp; why it bee done, and

when it bee done; least in defect hee bée counted a Coward, and in excesse a desperate and vnaduised gouernour. Your Grecian Annales tells vs of one Lamedos, that being a Captayne ouer the Athenians, in a skirmish fledde, which one of his owne souldiers seeing, cryed in retyring to him: Lamedos, why dishonorest thou thy Countrey by flight? Thou deceiuest thy selfe man (quoth he

                  ted the enemy, shewing that hee feared not death, but sought howe to the profit of his countrey, best to make manifest his courage.
               
                  Theseus yet liuing, who for his worthy and incomparable victories is canonised, as come from the Offspring of the gods, being in a battayle against the Athenians intrenched him selfe with a stronge countermure, and would not in many daies bee drawen out to fight, which his enemy Lyme

                  d said; Theseus, if thou beest such a hardie souldier as Fame reports thee to bee, why commest thou not out, but like a coward lyest intrenched: nay (

                  uoth Theseus smiling;) Lymestor, if thou beest of such courage, why doost thou not force mée out of my trenches? By this delay, shewing that hee sought to set Fortitude in hir prime, to adde oportunity to his valour, and so to fauour his prowesse with fortunate aduantage, that his attempt, as it should bee resolute, so it might bee for the profit of his Countrey, which insued according to his thoughts; for hee slew Lymestor, &amp; all his people: Experience then tells vs, as fortitude is necessary, so it is to bee vsed with such moderation, as by keeping the meane, it bée counted a vertue: Howe requisite it is in a Captaine, consideration of his place makes manifest; for being appointed Generall, and therefore Guyder and Gouernour of the rest, hee is to measure all his actions; yea, his very thoughts with such an honorable resolution, as laying apart all feare of death whatsoeuer, his charge and due

thereby to incourage his Souldiers, by imitating his valour to attempt the like, to bee formost in the march; and last in the retrayte: to preferre honor before death, and not to make estimation of the enemies, how many they be, but where they bee: otherwise in seeming to doubt of the multitude, his fearefull imagination greatly discourage his souldiers.
               
                  Sergius a woorthy Captaine, hauing but one hand, was of such courage and valour, that being alwayes in the face of the enemy: he returned Uictor in two and fifty great battailes. Lysias the woorthy Prynce of the Lacedemonians being demaunded how hee was honored with so many conquests, pulling out his sword, made answere; that with this hee made Fortune subiect to his desiers: attributing more credit to his owne prowesse, than to the inconstant deity of such a fickle goddesse. A Grecian Captaine, whose name commeth not readily to memory, being in a sore battaile against that mighty Monarch Pisandros, séeing his countrymen ready to flee for feare of the multitude of the enemy, whose fleete almost couered the Sea, sought to perswade them, but in vaine; wherevpon hée sent secretly one of his sonnes in a little skyfe to Pisandros, to tell him that his countrymen would escape by such a passage: which hee taking kindly, and presently stopping, added such a courage to the coward

Ambition, ye Serpent that stily insinuateth into mens mindes, not suffring loue or Lordship to brooke any fellowship, entring league with Enuy and Fortune, two enemies to Peace and prosperity, began to present them with the desire of a kingdome, and to think that fathers wills were buried with their bodies in their graues: that their commaunds were dated but while death, and that for a Crowne both father and law is to be neglected. Martignanus, wisest and eldest, thought that Pallas had power on earth as she had in heauen: that mens hearts were tied to their eares, that Eloquence could as much preuaile to perswade, as Mercuries Pipe to inchaunte: that the commons, whose mindes were to bee woon by plawsible discourses, would sooner create him king then his brother: taking therefore Time by the foreheade, seeing his eldest Brother was absent, and vncertaine assurance of his lyfe: he began to imagine how hee might displace Ortellius, from y• part of such a royall Legacie: his minde was not thus fraught with aspiring thoughtes, but Ortellius was

fortitude, hee did the more easely obtayne the conquest. Truth (quoth Nestor) for Hector him selfe confest that fortitude coulde not bee without wisedome, seeing, being placed betweene too extréeme want of wisdome, might make him offend in defect, and so bee counted a coward: or in excesse, and bee thought too desperate. If then fortitude cannot bee perfect without wisedome, and yet a man may bee wise without courage, it may bée cōcluded
                     •
                   that wisdome is the most necessary point in a souldier. Wee deny not (quoth Troilus) but it is necessarie, but not in the superlatiue degrée, for wisdome supposed the cause, fortitude consequently is the effect; sith the one of it selfe may intend by pollicie: but the other is put in practise by prowesse. Still for our purpose, (quoth Helenus) for the Logicians hold it as a principle, that the cause is greater then the effects: the Philosophers account a wise man onely to bee vertuous, thinking that wisedome being the chiefe vertue, produceth the rest as seedes sprong from so faire a Stemme: for it is possible for a man to want others, hauing this: but to possesse none, if this bee absent. Hector, a litle chollericke that so brauely they went about to prooue his haruest in the grasse, stammered out these or such like woordes. I tell you brother Helenus, both you and the rest are deceiued, &amp; that I will prooue against the wisest souldier in the world with my sword, that Senators who sit to giue counsaile for Ciuill pollicie, had neede to be wise, sith their opinions are holden for Oracles, &amp; Captaines valiant, whose deedes are accounted peremptorie conquests: put case wisedome &amp; fortitude be in a Generall, yet is hee called wise as hee giues iudgement, and couragious as with a hardy minde hee attempts the victories. Let men haue science in their heades, and no weapons in their hands, and whom can they preiudice: I say therefore, which none rightly can gainesay, that fortitude is most necessarie for a souldier, sith our common phrase confirmes my reason with euidence, in saying, hee is a wise Senator and a hardy souldier.

                  Hermes Trismegistus, whom some for his diuine precepts, haue thought to bée the sonne of Mercurie, made such account of this vertue of liberality, that hee doubted not to call it the heauenly influence, yt the gods most niggardly had in

                     •
                  s one of his friends, seest thou not how liberall Lisander hath bene too day, in bestowing so many good giftes vpon poore men: nay I haue not (quoth his friend) seene thee giue any thing at all: But I haue (answered Lisander) returned those presents, which I could not haue taken without their hinderance: meaning that preiudiciall gifts are rubbed with dishonor, and bring with them hatred and infamy. Theocritus an auncient Poet of ours, calleth liberality the theefe that most secretly stealeth away the mindes of men: his reason is this, that all estates for the most parte
                     •
                   adicted to couetousnesse and greedy desire of gaine, cast their

eyes euer after that obiect that glistereth most with riches, and set their opinions and censures with partiality on those whom Fortune hath fauored with many treasures: such sayth hee (as most bee) that are blinded with this couetous desire, are tyed so stricktly to the purse of a liberall man, as hee may at his pleasure drawe to what hee purposeth to imploy their vses: In such estimation haue our predecessors had this vertue, that they accounted not that day amongst the tearmes of their yeares, wherein they did not liberally bestow some benefits.
               But to touch more particularly a perfect dyscourse, and to prooue that it is necessarie in a souldier, let vs note the ende of martiall desires, which I remember, once I hard Thes

For what doth the wisedome of the Captaine by long and swéete orations, and sundry pollicies? what doth the fortitude of a generall, by hazarding him selfe among the thickest of his enemies preuaile: on

To confirme which, as Hector and Helenus haue done, I meane to rehearse a Tragedy, so your honorable presence shall fauour mee with patience. Achilles séeing by their countenance they expected no lesse, began his tale in this manner.

Honors are not tied to times, nor courage to places: Death is sweeter then discontent, and more glorious is it to perish in wishing well to Athens, then in lying quiet in Sicilia: The Thebans haue ouercome, that greeues mee not, sith it is but a braue of Fortune, whose fauours are inconstaunt, whose frownes are momētany, whose check is the step to good hap. The Athenians are vanquished; what of this? men are subiect to the pleasures of oportunities, their actions haue not alwaies prosperity fauorable: time changeth: and more honor is gotten in a moment, than hath bene lost in a moneth. The Athenians are rampired as cowardes within walles: this (country men) pincheth Roxander at the heart, that famous Athens, renowned Athens, Athens that was the chieftaine of Gréece for warlike att
