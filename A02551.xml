            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

MY EVER
moſt worthily honour'd
Lord, the Earle of
NORVVICH.
            
               My moſt honoured LORD:
            
            
               I Might not but
tell the world,
that this Sermon
which
was mine in the Pulpit, is
Yours in the Preſſe; your
Lordſhips will (which ſhall
neuer bee other then a command

to mee) fetches it
forth into the Light before
the fellowes. Let mee
bee branded with the Title
of it, if I can thinke it
worthy of the publike view,
in compariſon of many acurate
peeces of others, which
I ſee content themſelues
dayly to dye in the eare.
Howſoeuer, if it may doe
good, I ſhall bleſſe your
Lordſhip for helping to
aduance my gaine.
            Your noble and ſincere
true-heartedneſſe to your
God, your King, your

Countrey, your friend, is ſo
well knowne, that it can be
no diſparagement to your
Lordſhip to patronize this
Hypocrite; whoſe very inſcription
might caſt a blurr
vpon ſome guilty reputation.
Goe on ſtill (moſt noble
Lord) to be a great Example
of vertue and fidelity
to an hollow and vntruſty
Age: You ſhall not want either
the acclamations or
Prayers of
            
               Your Lordſhips euer deuoted
in all true duty, and obſeruance. IOS. Exon.
               
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            THE
HYPOCRITE.
            
               2. TIM. 5. 3.
               Hauing a forme of Godlines, but
denying the power thereof.
            
            
               IT is an vnperfect
Clauſe, you ſee,
but a perfect deſcription
of an
Hypocrite; and
that an Hypocrite of our own
times, the laſt; which are ſo
much the worſe, by how much
they partake more of the craft
and diſeaſes of age.
            
               
The Prophets were the Seers
of the old Teſtament, the Apoſtles
were the Seers of the
new; thoſe ſaw Chriſts day
and reioyced; theſe foreſaw
the reigne of Antichriſt and
complained. Theſe very times
were as preſent to S. Paul, as
to vs; our ſenſe doth not ſee
them ſo clearely, as his reuelation;
I am with you in the ſpirit,
(ſaith he to his abſent Coloſſians)
reioycing and beholding your
order, he doth as good as ſay to
vs, I am with you in the Spirit
lamenting, and beholding
your miſ-demeanours:
By theſe diuine Opticks, hee
ſees our formall piety, reall
wickednes; both which make
vp the compleate Hypocriſie
in my Text; Hauing a forme of

Godlineſſe, but denying the power
thereof.
            
            I doubt not but ſome will
bee ready to ſet this ſacred
Prognoſtication to another
Meridian; and indeed wee
know a generation that loues
themſelues too well, much
more then peace and truth;
ſo couetous that they would
catch all the world in S. Peters
net; proud boaſters of their
owne merits, perfections, ſupererogations;
it would bee
long (though eaſie) to follow
all: we know where too many
treaſons are hatched; wee
know who in the height of
minde exalts himſelfe aboue
all that is called God; wee
know where pleaſure hath the
moſt delicate and debauch'd

Clients; we know where Deuotion
is profeſſedly formall,
and liues impure; and ſurely,
were wee clearely innocent of
theſe crimes, I ſhould be the
firſt that would caſt this ſtone
at Rome: but now, that wee
ſhare with them in theſe ſins,
there is no reaſon wee ſhould
bee ſeioyned in the Cenſure.
Take it among yee therefore,
yee Hypocrites of all profeſſions,
for it is your owne; Yee
haue a forme of Godlineſſe, denying
the power thereof.
            
            What is an Hypocrite but a
Player, the Zani of Religion?
(as ye heard lately:) a Player
acts that he is not; ſo doe ye,
act good, and are wicked;
here is a ſemblance of good,
a forme of Godlineſſe; here

is a reall euill, a deniall of the
power of Godlineſſe. There
is nothing ſo good as Godlineſſe,
yea, there is nothing
good but it; nothing makes
Godlineſſe to be good, or to
be Godlineſſe, but the power
of it; for it is not, if it worke
not, and it workes not if not
powerfully; now the denyall
of good muſt needs bee euill;
and ſo much more euill, as the
good which is denyed is more
good; and therefore the denyall
of the power of Godlineſſe
muſt needs bee as ill, as
the forme or ſhew of Godlineſſe
would ſeeme good; and
as the power of Godlineſſe is
good: this is therefore the
perfect hypocriſie of faſhionable
Chriſtians; they haue the

forme, they deny the power;
here is then a direct and profeſſed
oppoſition betwixt 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , the forme, and
the power, and no leſſe, betweene
the actions employed
about them both; the one hauing,
the other denying; hauing
the forme, denying the power.
            
            As all ſinne is originally
from the Diuell, ſo eſpecially
Hypocriſie; hee is the father
of Lyes, and what is Hypocriſie
but a reall Lye? that is his
Darling: and theſe two are
well put together, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,
1. TIM. 3. 2. in Hypocriſie
ſpeaking Lyes. Now as
all things are more eminent in
their cauſes and originals, then
in the effects deriued from
them; ſo it muſt needs be ſaid,

that the greateſt Hypocrite in
the World is the Diuell: I
know hee heares what I ſay,
but wee muſt ſpeake truth
and ſhame him: For Satan is
trasformed into an Angel of light,
ſaith the Apoſtle; not he was,
but he is; ſo transformed that
he neuer did, neuer will put
off that counterfeit: and as all
his Impes are partakers of the
Satanicall nature; ſo in euery
Hypocrite there is both the
Angel and the Diuell; the ſeeming
Angel, is the forme of
Godlineſſe, the reall Diuell is
the denyall of the power of Godlineſſe.
It muſt be in another
ſenſe that that father ſaid, Innocentia
tempore poſterior eſt quam
malitia, I am ſure the Angel of
light was before the Satan; and

now becauſe hee is Satan, hee
puts on the Angel of light;
ſuch ſhall be our method in
this Hypocrite wee treat of:
firſt wee will begin with the
Angell of Hypocriſie; and
then ſhew you the Diuell in
his true ſhape.
            Firſt then, here is a forme,
and but a forme of Godlineſſe;
A forme do's well, but if it be
but a forme, it is an immateriall
ſhadow of Pietie: ſuch was
this of theſe men; for they
were vnnaturall, traytors, headye,
high-minded, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,
Surely, if they were vnnaturall,
they muſt needs bee vnchriſtian;
if they were traytors
to their King, they could
bee no Subiects to God; if
heady and high-minded, they

had nothing to doe with him
whoſe firſt Leſſon was, Learne
of me for I am meeke;
               No Creature is more humble then God. 
               Nulla creatura
humilior Deo, as Laurentius
well; if they had pleaſure
for their Idoll, they could not
haue the Lord for their God,
ſo as euen without God, they
had yet a forme of Godlineſſe;
Godlineſſe is a thing much
talkt of, little vnderſtood;
whiles the ancient Schoole had
wont to ſay, that it is not practicall,
not ſpeculatiue, but
affectiue; their meaning was
that it is in all theſe; in the
heart, in the braine, in the
hand, but moſt in the heart;
it is ſpeculatiue, in the knowledge
of God, practicall in the
Seruice to God, affectiue in
our feare of him, loue to him,

ioy in him: Shortly then, to
apprehend God as he hath reuealed,
to ſerue him as hee
hath required, to bee affected
to him as wee ought, is Godlineſſe;
and the outward expreſſion
and counterfaiſance
of all theſe is the forme of
Godlineſſe. To this out-ſide
of Godlineſſe then, belongs all
that glorious Pageant of faſhionable
profeſſion, which
wee ſee made in the World,
whether in wordes, geſture,
carriage.
            Firſt, here is a world of
good words, whether to God▪
or of him; here are words o
                  •
               
ſacred complement with God
for the Hypocrite courts God
in his Prayers; no man ſpeak
                  •
               
fairer, no man louder then he▪
               
Here is Sauls Benedictus; here
is the Phariſees, Lord I thanke
thee; here is the colloguing
Iewes, Domine, Domine, Lord,
Lord.
            
            And as to him, ſo of him;
here are words of religious proteſtation
for God, like to the
Iewes Templum Domini,
               The Temple of the Lord. or Herods
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , MAT. 2. 8. I will
worſhip the Babe. The mans ſecret
fire of zeale ſmokes forth
into the holy breath of a good
confeſſion; here are words of
feruent excitation to the frozen
hearts of others; yea, if
need bee words of deepe cenſure
of the cold moderation
which hee apprehends in his
wiſer Brethren;Neat in words if foule in fact. ſo as he is comptus
in verbo, if turpis in facto, as
Bernard.
            
            
               
Yet more, here is a perfect
Scoene of pious geſtures;
Knees bowed, hands erected,
turn'd vp eyes, the breſt beaten,
the head ſhaken, the countenance
deiected, ſighs aſcending,
teares dropping, the Bible
hugged and kiſſed, the
eare nayled to the pulpit; what
formality of deuout Godlineſſe
is here vnacted? if the
man were within, as hee is
without, there were no Saint
but he.
            Yet this is not all to make
vp a perfect forme of Godlineſſe,
here is a ſmooth face of
holy Carriage in actions: Deuout
Saul wil be ſauing the fatteſt
of the Amalekitiſh flocks
and heards for ſacrifice to the
Lord his God; good man, he

wil not haue God take vp vvith
the worſt; euery man is not of
this diet; too many think any
off all good enough for their
maker; but here is one that
holds the beſt to be fitteſt for
thoſe ſacred Altars; when in the
meane time the Hypocrite
had already ſacrificed them to
his owne Mammon, and God
muſt take vp with the reuerſion:
Shall I tell you of another
as good, as deuout as he? Doe
ye not remember that Abſalom
would goe to pay his vow
in Hebron? The faire Prince
of Iſrael was courteour before,
now he wi
                  •
               l bee godly too. It
was pietie that he would make
a vow to God; our Gallants
haue ſomewhat elſe to doe,
then to make holy vowes; at

euery word they proteſt and
vow, and perhaps ſweare, but
all like themſelues, vainly, and
idly; but Abſalom makes a ſollemne
and religious vow; It
was more pietie that he would
performe it; this is not euery
mans care; too many care not
how much they runne vpon
Gods ſcore; this man will
pitch and pay. Vnnaturall parricide!
firſt hee had ſtolne
the ſubiects hearts, and now
hee would ſteale his Fathers
Crowne, and all this villany
muſt ſtalk vnder a beaſts hide,
a Sacrifice at Hebron; Blood
was in his thoughts, whiles the
Sacrifice was in his mouth:
The old word is, full of curteſie,
full of craft; when yee ſee too
glittering pretences in vnapproued

perſons, ſuſpect the inſide;
Had you but ſeene a
Iewes faſt you would ſay ſo;
Eſa. 58. 6. here was nothing
but drooping and aſh-ſtrawed
heads, torne garments, bare
feete, ſtarued cheekes, skrubbed
skinnes, pined mawes, afflictiue
deuotions; yet a Iew
ſtill: But had you ſeene Herods
formality you would haue
ſaid it yet more; marke a little
and ſee Herod turn'd Diſciple
to Iohn Baptiſt; What Saul among
the Prophets, Herod among
the Diſciples? Surely
ſo; for hee heares him; Tuſh,
heares him, what's that? There
are thoſe that heare and would
not, forced to heare by compulſion
of Lawes; who may
ſay to Authority, as the Pſal

miſt ſayes to God; Aurem perforaſti
mihi: mine eare haſt thou
boared; their eare is a Proteſtant,
whiles their heart is
a Recuſant. There are thoſe
that heare and heare not; that
come faſhionably, and heare
perfunctorily, whoſe eares are
like the Pſalmiſts Idols; for
forme only, not for vſe; There
are thoſe that heare and care
not; who is ſo deafe as the wilfull?
there is auris aggrauata,
               Heauy eare.
               Eſ. 59. 1.Deafe eare. there is auris ſurda,
Mic. 7. But Herod heares, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,
gladly; with pleaſure; he heard
becauſe he loued to heare; yea,
ſo doth many a hollow heart
ſtill; ye ſhall haue ſuch a one
liſten as if he were totus auris,
all eare, as if he would latch euery
word from the Preachers
               
mouth ere it could get out:
perhaps it is new, perhaps witty,
perhaps elegant, or ſome
way pleaſing; yea there are
ſome not onely willing but
greedy hearers, they haue aures
bibulas, they heare hungrily
and thirſtily, but it is but to
catch aduantages; ſomewhat
they hope may fall to pay the
Preacher; Herod is better then
ſo, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , hee obſerued, hee
reſpected, hee countenanced
this rough hewne Chaplaine;
Yea, ſo doth many a lewd Patron
for his owne turne; either
the eaſie paſſage of his Simonaicall
ſubductions, or for a
fauorable conniuencie at his
guilty debauchedneſſe; good
lookes are good cheape; perhaps
a meales meat may come

in for a further obligation too;
but here is no good action the
while; Herod is better then
ſo, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , he did too, and
did many things; lo he are he
doth not heare but doe; and
not ſome things but many;
It may bee this Camel-hayr'd
monitor told him of ſome
outragious diſorders in his
Court, thoſe hee was willing
to amend; perhaps hee told
him of ſome, bribery of his
Officers, vniuſt or hard meaſures
offered by oppreſſiue
Miniſters to his poore Subiects,
thoſe he was ready to reforme,

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                he did many
things; One would thinke
Bernard ſhould not need to
brand his Hailardus, with intus
Herodes,
               
                  Herod within Iohn without. 
               foris Iohannes, his very

out-ſide was generally good,
elſe hee had not done many
things: Here was a forme of
Godlineſſe, but let me tell you,
and higher forme then many
of vs (for ought I ſee) care to
climbe vp vnto; there is is hearing,
and talking, and profeſſing
enough in the world, but
where is the doing? or if there
bee doing, yet it is ſmall doing
(God wot.) Some things
we may be drawne to doe, not
many; one good deed in a
life is well; one fault amen
ded meriteth: to doe many is
not incident to many; ſo as too
many of vs are vpon a forme
of Godlineſſe, but it is a lower
forme then Herods; who heard,
and heard gladly, &amp; obſeru'd
his teacher, and did, &amp; did ma-

things; yet a groſſe Hypocrite
ſtill becauſe he did but many;

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                is God rule.Either all, or none all.
            
            What ſhould I weary you
with inſtances? Doe yee ſee
an Ananias and Saphira making
God their heyre of their halfe-ſhared
Patrimony? Doe you
ſee a griping Vſurer build
Schooles and Hoſpitals with
ten in the hundred? Doe you
ſee a man whoſe ſtomacke inſatiably
craues new ſuperadditions,
vpon the indigeſted
morſels of his laſt houres Lecture,
and yet nauſeates at the
publike praiers of the Church?
Doe you ſee a ſuperſtitious votary
looking rufully from his
knees vpon his adored Crucifixe;
and as Iſaac the Syryan
preſcribes, liuing like a dead

man in a ſolitary Sepulcher,
yet making no bones of killing
Kings?
            Nay, to aſcend vnto an higher
key of pretended holineſſe▪
Doe yee ſee ſome of the elect
Manichees lying vpon hard
mats, which S. Auſtin ſayes
were therfore called Ma
                     •
                  tarij?
Doe ye ſee the penances of the
three ſuper-mortified Orders
of the Mahumetan Saints?
Doe ye ſee an illuminate Elder
of the Anabaptiſts rapt
in diuine extaſies? Doe yee
ſee a ſtigmaticall Fryer laſhing
himſelfe to blood, wallowing
in the ſnow naked, returning
the lice into his boſome?
Doe ye ſee a nice humoriſt,
that will not dreſſe a
diſh, nor lay a cloth, nor walke

abroad on a Sunday, and yet
make no conſcience of coozening
his neighbour on the
worke-day.
            All theſe and many others
of the ſame kinde are Swans,
which vnder white feathers
haue a blacke skin; Theſe haue
a forme of Godlineſſe, and
are the worſe for it; for as it is
the moſt dangerous and killing
flattery that is brought in
vnder a pretence of liberty, ſo
it is the moſt odious and perilous
impiety that is hid vnder
a forme of Godlineſſe.
            
            Theſe men, I ſay, haue
a forme; and nothing elſe ſaue
a forme of Godlineſſe, But
withall, let me adde, that whoſo
euer makes a good profeſſion
hath this forme; and is ſo

farre commendable, as he profeſſes
well: If there bee not
matter to this forme, the fault
is in what is not, and not in
what there is. Certainly Religion
is not Chaos-like without
forme; As not Ciuility, ſo
Godlineſſe cannot be without
due forme; ye cannot thinke
Gods Seruice to be all lining,
no out-ſide; A forme there
muſt be. It was a Law written
in Greeke and Latine Letters
ouer the gate of the firſt
peculiar partition of the Temple,
which was atrium Iudaeorum;
Euery ſtranger that paſſes
into the holy Place muſt die;
if hee had not the marke of a
Iew vpon his fleſh, it was capitall
to tread in thoſe holy
Courts: The Temple was the

Type of the Church; if wee
haue not ſo much as a forme of
Godlines; procul, ô procul; without
ſhall be dogs; and if a Beaſt
touch the Mount, it ſhall dye.
What ſhall we ſay to thoſe gallants
that hate to haue ſo much
as a forme of Godlineſſe? there
cannot be a greater diſparagement
caſt vpon them, then the
very ſemblance of Deuotion;
To ſay Grace at meals, to bow
a knee in prayer, to name God
other then in an oath, to once
mention Religion, is a baſe,
mortify'd puſillanimous tenderneſſe.
What talke ye of
a Sermon? a Play if you will;
what ſpeake you of weeping
for ſinns? talke of drinking
healths, ſinging of rounds,
courting of Dames, reuels,

matches, games, any thing
ſaue goodneſſe; what ſhould
we ſay of theſe men? euen this;
He that hath but a forme, is an
Hypocrite; but hee that hath
not a forme is an Atheiſt; I
know not whether I ſhould ſeuer
theſe two; Both are humane
Diuels well met; an Hypocrite
is a masked Diuell; an
Atheiſt is a Diuell vnmasked:
whether of them ſhal without
their repentance be deeper in
Hell, they ſhall once feele, I
determine not; Onely let me
aſſure them, that if the infernall
Topheth bee not for them,
it can challenge no gueſts.
            Thus ſuch for the forme of
Godlineſſe, which is the Angel
of Hypocriſie; our ſpeech deſcends
to the Diuell in Hypo-

which is the denial of the power of
Godlines: but whiles I am about
to repreſent vnto you the vgly
face of that wicked one; God
meets vs in the way, and ſtayes
my thoughts and ſpeech vpon
the power of Godlines, ere we fall
vpon the deniall of that power.
What power then is this of Godlines?
what doth it? what can it
doe? The weakenes of it is too
apparent: If we look to the Author
of it Chriſt Ieſus; alas, he is

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , a Butt or mark
for oppoſition to ſhoot at;
whereas true power is an Alchum,
that bars reſiſtance, Prou.
30. if to the means of Godlines,
here is the fooliſhneſſe of Preaching,
1. Cor. 1. 21. if to the effects
of Godlines, here is weak grace,
ſtrong corruption, Ro. 7. if to

the oppoſites of Godlines, here
is a Law fighting; fighting? perhaps
ſo it may be, &amp; be foyled;
nay, but here is 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; a
conquering and captiuing Law,
Ro. 7. 23. wherby I am not only
made a ſlaue, but ſold for a ſlaue

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , Rom. 7. 14. So then
here is an oppoſed Sauiour, a
fooliſh preaching, a feeble
grace, a domineering corruption;
and where then is the
power of Godlineſſe all this
while. Know O thou fooliſh
man that God is 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , the ſtrong
God; and yet there is a Diuell;
Hee could call in the being
of that malignant Spirit; but
he will not; he knowes how
to magnifie his power by an
oppoſite. Chriſt will be ſpoken
againſt, not for impotence

to reſiſt, but for the glory of
his preuailing; ſo wee haue
ſeene a well tempered Target
ſhot at to ſhow the impenetrableneſſe
of it.
            
               Preaching is fooliſhneſſe, but
it is ſtultitia Doi; and the fooliſhneſſe
of God is wiſer then then
the wiſedome of men. Grace is
weake, where corruption is
ſtrong, but where grace preuailes,
ſin dares not ſhew his
head; ſin fights and ſubdues
his owne Vaſſals, but the
power of Godlines foyles it in the
renewed; ſo as if it liue, yet it
raignes not Great then is the
power of Godlineſſe; great euery
way; great in reſpect of our enemies,
great in reſpect of our
ſelues; of our enemies, The
Diuell, the World, the Fleſh.
            
               
So great firſt, that it can reſiſt
the Diuel; and this no ſmall
matter to reſiſt the powers
and Principalities of Hell;
whom reſiſt, ſtedfaſt in the faith.
            
            Reſiſt? Alas, what is this?
The weake may perhaps reſiſt
the ſtrong; the Whelpe the
Lyon; We may reſiſt the ſpirit
of God himſelfe, ſemper
restitiſtis, ſaith Saint Stephen
of the Iewes; Lo here is reſiſtance
to God; and not for a
brunt, but perpetuall; ye haue
alwaies reſiſted, ſo the ſhip reſiſts
the Rocke againſt which
it is ſhattered; ſo the cruſhed
worme turns towards the foot
that treads it; Yea, but here is
a preualent reſiſtance, Reſiſt
the Diuill and he ſhall flee from
you, Iam. 4. 7. Lo, Godlineſſe

can make a Coward of the
great Prince of Darkeneſſe.
Hee ſhall flee; but, if Parthian-like
hee ſhall ſhoot fleeing,
as hee doth; Lo, this ſhall
quench all the fiery darts of Satan.
Epheſ. 6. If hee betake
himſelfe to his hold; this can
bater, and beat downe the ſtrong
holds of ſin about his cares; this
can enter, and bind the ſtrong
man: Shortly, it can conquer
Hell, yea make vs more then
Conquerors; Lo, to conquer is
not ſo much as to make another
a Conqueror; but more
then a Conqueror is yet more;
Is there any of you now that
would be truely great and victorious?
it is the power of
Godlineſſe that muſt doe it:
Pyrrhus his word concerning

his Soldiers, was Tu grandes,
ego fortes; Surely, if our Profeſſion
make vs great, our faith
muſt make vs valiant and ſucceſsfull:
I tell you the conqueſt
of an euill ſpirit is more
then the conqueſt of a world
of men: Oh then, what is it to
conquer Legions?
            And as it foiles Sathan, ſo
the world: No maruell, for if
the greater, much more the
leſſe. The world is a ſubiect,
Sathan a Prince, the Prince of
this world: The world is a bigot,
Satan is a God: The God of
this world: If the Prince, if the
God be vanquiſht, how can the
ſubiect or ſuppliant ſtand out?
What doe we talke of an Alexander,
or a Ceſar conquering the
world: Alas what ſpots of

earth were they which they
bragged to ſubdue: In ſo much
that Rome which in two hundred
fortie three yeares had
gained but ſome fifteene miles
about, in Seneca's time, when
her Dition was at the largeſt,
had the neighbouring Germanie
for the bounds of it: Loe
here a full conqueſt of the
whole world,The whole world is ſet in euill. 
               Mundns totus in
maligno: To conquer the whole
materiall world is not ſo happie,
ſo glorious a worke, as to
conquer the malignant, and
this the power of Godlineſſe onlie
can doe, this is the victorie that
ouercomes the world; euen your
faith. And now what can the
fleſh doe, without the World,
without the Deuill? Surelie,
were is not for the Deuill: the

world and the fleſh were both
good; and if it were nor for
the Deuill and the World, the
fleſh were our beſt friend:
now they haue debauch't it,
and turn'd it traitor to GOD,
and the Soule: now this proud
fleſh dares warre againſt heauen
Godlineſſe doth 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
beat it blacke and blew: Yea,
kill it dead, Martifie your earthly
members, Coloſ. 3. So as it hath
not a limbe to ſtir, not a breath
to draw. Anacharſis his charge
was too hard for another, but
performable by a Chriſtian,

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                Hee
can rule his tongue, his gut,
his luſt: Sampſon was a ſtrong
man, yet two of them he could
not rule: the power of Godlineſſe
can rule all: Oh then the great

               power of godlines that can trample
vpon the fleſh, the World,
the Deuill: Super aspidem, vpon
the Aſpe, the Dragon, the
Lion: Or as the Pſalmiſt, Pſal.
91. Vpon that roaring Lion of
Hell, vpon that ſinuous Dragon
the World, vpon that cloſe
biting Aſpe the fleſh.
            And as great in reſpect of
our enemies, ſo no leſſe great
in reſpect of our ſelues, Great,
and beneficiall: What wonders
are done by Godlineſſe?
Is it not a great wonder to
make a Foole wiſe, to make
the blind ſee? This godlineſſe
can doe: Pſal. 19. 7, 8. Let mee
be bold to ſay; we are naturally
like Salomons childe; Folly is
bound to our heart, Prou. 22. 15. in
things pertaining to GOD;
               
(
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) We were fooliſh, ſaith
Saint Paul, Titus 3. Would any
of vs that are thus borne naturals
(to God) bee wiſe to ſaluation?
That is the true wiſdome
indeed, all other is but folly,
yea, madneſſe to that: The
Schooles cannot teach vs this;
Philoſophie, whether, Natural,
or Morall, or Politicke can do
nothing to it; if yee truſt to
to it, it is but (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) vaine
deceit, as Saint Paul, Coloſſ. 2. 8.
Triobularis &amp; vilis, as Chryſoſtome;
It is only Godlineſſe
muſt doe it: Pleaſe your ſelues,
how you liſt, without this, yee
great Politicians of the world,
the wiſe God hath put the pide
coate vpon your backs, &amp; paſt
vpon you his (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) Rom. 1.
22. If ye were Oracles to men,

ye are Ideots to God: Malitia
occaecat intellectum,
               Wickedneſſe blinds the vnderſtanding. as he ſaid, ye
quick-ſighted Eagles of the
world, without this ye are as
blinde as Beetles to heauen: If
ye would haue eies to ſee him
that is inuiſible; the hand of
your omnipotent Sauiour
muſt touch you, and at his bidding
you muſt waſh off your
worldly clay with the Siloam
of godlineſſe.
            Is it not a wonder to raiſe
the dead? wee are all naturally
not ſicke, not qualming, not
dying, but dead in ſinne, Coloſ. 2.
13. Yea▪ with Lazarus quatriduam,
and ill ſenting; yea (if
that will adde any thing) as S.
Iudes trees, or as (they ſay of)
acute Scotus, twice dead; would
ye ariſe? It is only godlineſſe

that can doe it: Yee are riſen
vp through the faith in the operation
of God, Coloſ. 2. 12. This only
can call vs out of the graue
of our ſinnes: Ariſe thou that
ſleepeſt, and ſtand vp from the
dead, and Chriſt ſhall giue thee
life: Chriſt is the author, godlineſſe
is the meanes. All yee
that heare mee this day, either
ye are aliue, or would be: Life
is ſweet: euerie one challenges
it; Doe yee liue willingly in
your ſinnes; Let me tell you,
ye are dead in your ſins: This
life is a death: If you wiſh to
liue comfortably here, and gloriouſly
hereafter, it is godlines
that muſt mortifie this life in
ſinne; that muſt quicken you
from this death in ſinne: Flatter
your ſelues how you pleaſe

ye great gallants of both ſexes,
yee thinke your ſelues goodlie
peeces; without godlineſſe ye
are the worſt kind of carcaſſes:
for as death or not being is the
worſt condition that can befall
a creature: So death in ſinne is
ſo much the worſt kinde of
death, by how much grace is
better then nature: A liuing
Dog, or Toad is better then a
thus-dead ſinner: Would yee
riſe out of this loathſome and
wofull plight, it is godlineſſe,
that muſt breathe grace into
your dead limbes, and that
muſt giue you the motions of
holy obedience.
            Is it not a wonder to caſt
out Deuils? I tell you the corporall
poſſeſſion of ill ſpirits is
not ſo rare, as the ſpirituall is

rife: No naturall man is free:
One hath the ſpirit of errour,
1. Tim. 4. another the ſpirit of fornications,
Oſe 2. another the ſpirit
of feare, 2. Tim. 1. another the
ſpirit of ſlumber, another the
ſpirit of giddineſſe, another the
ſpirit of pride: all haue Spiritum
mundi, the ſpirit of the world,
1. Cor. 1. 12. Our ſtorie in Guliel.
Neubrigenſis, tels vs of a countriman
of ours, one Kettell of
Farnham, in King HENRY the
Seconds time, that had the facultie
to ſee ſpirits: by the ſame
token, that hee ſaw the Deuils
ſpitting ouer the Drunkards
ſhoulders, into their pots: the
ſame facultie is recorded of
Anthony the Heremite, and Sulpitius
reports the ſame of Saint
Martin, ſurely there need none

of theſe eies to diſcerne euerie
naturall mans ſoule haunted
with theſe euill angels, Let me
aſſure you, all ye that haue not
yet felt the power of Godlineſſe, ye
are as truely (though ſpiritually)
carried, by euill ſpirits into
the deeps of your knowne
wickedneſſe, as euer the Gaderen
hogges were carried by
them downe the precipice, into
the Sea; would ye be free
from this helliſh tyranny? only
the power of Godlineſſe can do
it. 2. Tim. 2. 23. If peraduenture
God will giue them repentance,
that they may recouer themſelues
out of the ſnares of the Diuell;
and Repentance is you know
a maine part of Godlineſſe; If
euer therefore ye be diſpoſſeſſed
of that euill one, it is the

power of Godlineſſe that muſt do
it.
            What ſpeake I of power? I
had like to haue aſcribed to it
the acts of omnipotencie; And
if I had done ſo; it had not bin
much amiſſe; for what is godlineſſe
but one of thoſe rayes
that beames forth from that
Almightie Deitie? What but
that ſame, Dextra excelſi,
               The right hand of the moſt high. wherby
hee workes mightily vpon
the ſoule? Now, when I ſay the
man is ſtrong, is it any derogation
to ſay his arme is ſtrong?
Faith and Praier are no ſmall
peeces of Godlines, and what
is it that God can doe, which
Praier and Faith can not doe?
Will yee ſee ſome inſtances of
the further acts of Godlineſſe?
Is it not an act of omnipotence

to change nature? Iannes and
Iambres, the Egyptian. Sorcerers
may iuggle away the Staffe, &amp;
bring a Serpent into the roome
of it; none but a Diuine power
(which Moſes wrought by)
could change the Rod into a
Serpent, or the Serpent into a
Rod: Nothing is aboue nature,
but the God of nature; nothing
can change nature, but that
which is aboue it: for nature is
regular, in her proceedings; &amp;
will not bee croſt by a finite
power; ſince all finite agents
are within her command. Is it
not a manifeſt change of the
nature of the Wolfe, to dwell
quietly with the Lambe, of the
Leopard to dwell with the kid, of
the Lion to eat ſtraw like the Oxe,
of the Aſpe to play with the child?
               
How ſhall this be? it is an idle
conceit of the Hebrewes, that
ſauage beaſts ſhall forgo their
hurtfull natures vnder the M
                     •
                  ſſias;
No, but rat
                  •
               onall beaſts
ſhall alter their diſpoſitions:
the rauenous oppreſſor is the
Wolfe, the tyrannicall perſecutor
is the Leopard; the venemous
Hereticke is the Aspe;
theſe ſhall turne innocent, and
vſefull by the power of Godlineſſe,
for then the earth ſhall
bee full of the knowledge of the
Lord, Eſay 11. 6, 7. Is it not a
manifeſt change of nature for
the Ethiopian to turn white, for
the Leopard to turne ſpotleſſe,
This is done when thoſe doe
good which are accuſtomed to euill
Ier. 13. 23. and this godlineſſe
can doe: Is it not a manifeſt

change of nature for the Camel,
to paſſe through a needles eye; this
is done, when through the
power of godlineſſe ye great and
rich men get to heauen. Laſtly,
it is an eaſie thing to turne
men into beaſts (a cup too
much can doe it) but to turne
beaſts into Men; Men into
Saints; Deuils into Angels; it is
no leſſe then a worke of omnipotencie,
and this godlineſſe
can doe.
            But to riſe higher then a
change; Is it not an act of omnipotencie
to create? Nature
can goe on in her tracke whether
of continuing what ſhee
actually finds to be; or of producing
what ſhe forbids to be
potentially in pre-exiſting cauſes;
but to make new matter,

tranſcends her power; this god
lineſſe can do; here is (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               )
a new creatre, 2. Cor. 5. There is
in nature no prediſpoſition to
grace; the man muſt bee no
leſſe new, then when hee was
made firſt of the duſt of the
earth, &amp; that earth of nothing;
Nouus homo, Eph. 4. 21. How is
this done by Creation, and how
is he created? In righteouſneſſe
and holineſſe; holineſſe to God,
righteouſneſſe to men; both
make vp Godlineſſe, A regeneration
is here a Creation,
Progenuit is expreſſed by Creauit,
Iam. 1. 18. and this by the
word of truth. Old things are paſſed,
ſaith the Apoſtle, all muſt
be new, if wee will haue ought
to doe with God; our bodies
muſt bee renued by a glorious

reſurrection ere they can inioy
heauen; our ſoules muſt bee
renued by Grace ere wee can
inioy God on earth: Are there
any of vs pained with our heart
of ſtone? Wee may b
                  •
               e well enough,
the ſtone of the reines
or bladder is a woful paine, but
the ſtone of the heart is more
deadly; hee can by this power
take it out, and giue vs a heart of
fleſh, Ezec. 12. Are there any of
vs wearie of carrying our old
Adam about vs? a grieuous burthen
I confeſſe, &amp; that which
is able to weigh vs downe to
Hell; doe wee groane vnder
the load, and long to be eaſed?
none but that Almightie hand
can doe it; by the power of
godlineſſe creating vs anew,
to the likeneſſe of that ſecond

Adam, which is from heauen, heauenly;
without which there is
no poſſibilitie of ſaluation: for
fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the
Kingdome of God: In a word,
would wee haue this earth of
ours tranſlated to heauen, it is
only the power of godlineſſe can
doe it:
            And as this power of godlines
is great, ſo no leſſe beneficiall;
Beneficiall euery way, both
here, and hereafter; Here, it
frees vs from euill, it feoffs vs
in good; Godlineſſe is an Antidote
againſt all miſchiefe, and
miſerie; yea, ſuch is the power
of it that it not only keepes vs
from euill, but turnes that euill
to good: All things worke together
to the beſt to them that loue
&amp; feare God, ſaith the Apoſtle;

lo, all things; Croſſes, ſinnes;
Croſſes are bleſſings, ſinnes
are aduantages; Saint Pauls
Viper befriended him, Saint
MARTINS Ellebore nouriſht
him; Saluti fuere peſtifera,
as Seneca ſpeakes; And what
can hurt him that is bleſſed by
croſſes, &amp; is bettered by ſins?
It feoffes vs in good; Wealth,
Honour, Contentment; The
Apoſtle puts two of them together,
Godlineſſe is great gaine
with contentment, 1. Tim. 6. 6.
Here are no iffs, or ands; but
gaine, great gaine, and gaine
with ſelf-ſufficiencie or contentment;
wickedneſſe may yeeld
a gaine, ſuch as it is for a time;
but it will bee grauell in the
throat; gaine farre from contentment.
Length of dayes are in

the right hand of true wiſdome,
and in her left hand riches and honour,
Prou. 3. 16. Lo, honour &amp;
wealth are but gifts of the left
hand; common and meane fauours;
Length, yea, eternitie of
daies is for the right, that is the
height of bountie; Godlineſſe
hath the promiſes of this life, and of
that which is to come, ſaith the
Apoſtle; the promiſe, that is enough;
Gods promiſes are his
performances; with men to
promiſe, and to pay are two
things; they are one with God;
To them that by patient continuing
in wel-doing, ſeeke glory and
honour and immortalitie, eternall
life, Rom. 2. 7. Briefly (for I
could dwell here alwayes) it is
godlineſſe that only can giue
vs, the beatificall ſight of God;

the ſight? yea, the fruition of
him, yea, the vnion with him;
not by appoſition, not by ad
haeſion, but by a bleſſed participation
of the diuine nature, 2.
Pet. 1. 4. I can go no higher; no
the Angels and Arch-angels
cannot looke higher then this.
            To ſumme vp all then;
Godlines can giue wiſedome
to the foole, eyes to the blind,
life to the dead; it can eiect
Diuels, change the courſe of
Nature, create vs anew, free
vs from euill feoffe vs in good,
honour, wealth, contentment,
euerlaſting happineſſe. Oh
the wonderfull, Oh the beneficiall
power of Godlineſſe! And
now, what is the deſire of my
ſoule, but that all this could
make you in loue with Godlineſſe;

                the
ambitions of honour, the tradings
for wealth, the purſuit
of pleaſure, your hearts could
be ſet on fire with the zealous
affectation of true Godlineſſe;
Alas, the leaſt ouerture of any
of theſe makes vs mad of the
world; if but the ſhadow of a
little honour, wealth, promotion,
pleaſure bee caſt before
vs, how eagerly doe we proſecute
it, to the eternall hazard
of our Soules? behold, the ſubſtance
of them all put to together
offers▪ it ſelfe in Godlines;
how zealouſly ſhould we embrace
them: and neuer giue
reſt to our Soules, till we haue
laid thoſe true grounds of hapneſſe,
which ſhall continue
with vs, when all our riches,

and earthly glorie ſhall lie
downe with vs in the duſt:
Alas, noble and Chriſtian hearers,
yee may bee outwardly
great, and inwardly miſerable;
it was a great Caeſar that ſaid, I
haue beene all things, and am
neuer the better; It is not your
bags ye wealthy Citizens that
can keepe the Gout from your
ioynts, or Care from your
hearts; It is not a Coronet, ye
great Peeres that can keepe
your heads from aching; all
this earthly pompe and magnificence
cannot keepe out either
death, or conſcience; Our
proſperity preſents vs as goodly
Lillies, which whiles they
are whole, look faire and ſmell
ſweet, but if once bruiſed a little,
are naſtie both in ſight and

ſent; it is only Godlineſſe that
can hold vp our heads in the
euill day, that can bid vs make
a mocke at all the bluſtering
ſtormes of the world, that can
protect vs from all miſeries
(which if they kil▪ yet they cannot
hurt vs) that can improue
our ſufferings, and inueſt vs
with true &amp; eternall glory; Oh
then be couetous, be ambitious
of this bleſſed eſtate of the
Soule; and as Simon Macchabeus
with three yeeres labour tooke
downe the top of mount Acra
in Hieruſalem, that no hill
might ſtand in competition of
height with the Temple of
God, ſo let vs humble and proſtrate
all other deſires to this
one, that true Godlines may
haue the ſway in vs.
            
               
Neither is this conſideration
more fit to bee a whetſtone
to our zeale, then a
touch ſtone to our condition;
Godlineſſe? why it is an herb
that growes in euery ſoyle; as
Platina obſerues, that for 900.
yeares and vpwards, none of
thoſe Popes of whom ſanctity
is aſcribed in the abſtract, were
yet held Saints after their
death, except Celeſtine the 5.
which gaue vp the Pontificall
Chayre, after ſixe Moneths
weary ſitting in it; ſo on the
contrary, wee may liue Ages
ere wee heare a man profeſſe
himſelfe god-leſſe, whiles
hee is abominably ſuch: He
is too bad, that will not
bee thought godly; as it
is a brazen-fac'd Curtezan,

that would not bee held honeſt.
            That which Lactantius ſaid
of the Heathen Philoſophers,
that they had many Schollers,
few followers, I cannot ſay of
the Diuiue; wee haue enow
to learne, enow to imitate,
but few to act; Be not deceiued,
Godlineſſe is not impotent;
where euer Godlines is,
there is power: Hath it then
preuayled to open our eyes, to
ſee the great things of our peace?
hath it rayſed vs, vp from the
graue of our ſinnes? eiected
our helliſh corruptions, changed
our wicked natures, new
created our hearts? well may
we applaud our ſelues is the
confidence of our godlineſſe;
but if we be ſtill old, ſtill corrupt,

ſtill blind, ſtill dead, ſtill
diueliſh; Away vaine Hypocrites,
yee haue nothing to
doe with Godlineſſe, becauſe
Godlineſſe hath had no power
on you: Are yee godly,
that care to know any thing
rather then God and ſpirituall
things: Are yee godly,
that haue neither ability nor
will to ſerue that God whom
yee faſhionably pretend to
know? Are ye godly, which
haue no inward awe of that
God whom yee pretend to
ſerue? No gouernment of
your Paſſions, no Conſcience
of your Actions, no
care of your Liues? Falſe
Hypocrites, yee doe but abuſe
and prophane that name
which yee vniuſtly arrogate;

No, no; Godlineſſe can no
more be without power, then
the God that works it; Shew
mee your Godlineſſe in the
true feruor of your Deuotions,
in the effectuall ſanctification
of your hearts and
tongues; in the conſcionable
carriage of your liues. Elſe
lo the wicked, ſaith God, what
haſt thou to doe to take my Couenant
in thy mouth, ſeeing thou
hateſt to bee reformed, PSAL.
50. 16.
            Yee haue heard the power of
Godlineſſe; heare now the denyall
of this power: How then
is it denyed; Surely, there
is a verball; there is a reall denyall;
&amp; rebus &amp; verbis, as
Hilary, It is a miſtaking of
Logicians, that Negation is

the affection of a Propoſition
onely; No; God and Diuiuitie
finde it more in Practice;
This very power is as
ſtoutly challenged by ſome
men in words, as truely denied
in actions; As one ſayes of
the Phariſees anſwer concerning
Iohns calling, verum dicebant
&amp; mentiebantur;
               They told truth and yet lyed. ſo may
I of theſe men; It is not in
the power of words to deny
ſo ſtrongly as deeds can; both
the hand, and the tongue interpret
the heart, but the hand
ſo much more liuely, as there
is more ſubſtance in acts, then
ſounds; As he ſaid Spectamur
agendo; we are both ſeene and
heard in our actions. Hee that
ſayes there is no God is a vocall
Atheiſt; hee that liues as

if there were no God is a vitall
Atheiſt; he that ſhould ſay
Godlineſſe hath no power is
a verball Atheiſt; hee that ſhall
liue as if Godlineſſe had no
power, is a reall Atheiſt: they
are Atheiſts both. We would
flye vpon a man that ſhould
denye a God with Diagoras,
though (as Anſelme well) no
man can doe this interius,
from within; wee would
burne a man that ſhould deny
the Deitie of Chriſt with
Arrius; wee would rend our
clothes at the blaſphemie of
that man, who with the Epicures
and Apelleians ſhould exempt
the cares and operations
of God from the things
below; wee would ſpit at a
man that durſt ſay, there is

no power in Godlineſſe: Theſe
monſters (if there bee ſuch)
hide their vgly heads, and
finde▪ it not ſafe to looke on
the light; Fagots are the beſt
language to ſuch miſcreants:
but theſe reall denyals are ſo
much more rife, and bold, as
they can take the aduantage
of their outward ſafety, and
vnconuincibleneſſe.
            Their wordes are honey,
their life poyſon, as Bernard
ſaid of his Arnoldus: And theſe
actions make too much noyſe
in the world; that which Saint
Chryſoſtome ſaies of the laſt day,
that mens works ſhall ſpeake,
their tongues ſhal be ſilent; is
partly true in the meane time;
their workes cry out, whiles
their tongues whiſper: There

is then really a double denial of
the power of Godlines; the one in
not doing the good it requires,
the other in doing the euill it
forbids: The one a priuatiue,
the other a poſitine denyall.
            In the former, what power
hath Godlineſſe if it haue not
made vs good? a feeble Godlines
it is that is ineffectuall; if
it haue not wrought vs to bee
deuout to God, iuſt to men,
ſober and temperate in the vſe
of Gods creatures, humble in
our ſelues, charitable to others;
where is the Godliness?
where is the power? If theſe
were not aparantly done, there
were no forme of Godline, if
theſe be not ſoundly &amp; heartily
done, there is a palpable deniall
of the power of Godlines. Heare

this then ye ignorant and ſeduced
ſoules that meaſure your
Deuotions by number not by
weight; or that leaning vpon
your idle elbow yawningly
patter out thoſe prayers,
whoſe ſound or ſenſe yee vnderſtand
not; yee that bring
liſt-leſſe eares ſeuered from
your wandring hearts, to the
Meſſages ſent from Heauen;
yee that come to Gods board,
as a ſurfeited ſtomacke to an
Hony-combe, or a ſicke ſtomacke
to a Potion: Shortly, ye
that pray without feeling, hear
without care, receiue without
appetite; ye haue a forme of
godlines, but deny the power of it.
            
            Heare this, yee that weare
out the floore of Gods houſe
with your frequent attendance;

yee that haue your
eares open to Gods Meſſengers,
and yet ſhut to the cries
of the Poore, of the Orphan,
of the Labourer, of the diſtreſſed
Debtor; ye that can
lift vp thoſe hands to heauen
in your faſhionable prayers,
which yee haue not reached
out to the reliefe of the needy
members of your Sauiour;
(whiles I muſt tell you by the
way that hard rule of Laurentius,
Magis delinquit diues non
largiendo ſuperflua, quam pauper
rapiendo neceſſaria; the
rich man offends more in not
giuing his ſuperfluities, then
the poore man in ſtealing neceſſaries)
Yee that haue a
fluent tongue to talke vnto
God, but haue no tongue to

ſpeake for God, or to ſpeake
in the cauſe of the dumbe: Ye
haue a forme of Godlineſſe, but
deny the power thereof.
            
            Shortly, yee that haue no
feare of God before your
eyes, no loue to goodneſſe,
no care of obedience, no
conſcience of your actions,
no diligence in your Callings,
yee haue denied the power of
Godlineſſe; This very priuatiue
denial, ſhall without your repentance
damne your ſoules:
Remember, Oh, remember
that there needes no other
ground of your laſt and heauieſt
doome, then Yee haue not
giuen, Yee haue not viſited; But
the Poſitiue denyall is yet
more irrefragable; If very
priuations and ſilence ſpeake,

much more are actions vocall:
Heare this then yee viſors
of Chriſtianitie, who notwithſtanding
all your ciuill
ſmoothneſſe, when yee are
once moued, can teare Heauen
with your Blaſphemies,
and bandy the dreadful name,
of GOD in your impure
mouthes, by your bloody
Oathes, and Execrations; ye
that dare to exerciſe your ſaucie
wits in prophane ſcoffes
at Religion; yee that preſume
to whet your law-leſſe
tongues, and lift vp your rebellious
hands againſt lawfull
authority whether in Church
or State; yee that grinde faces
like edge-tooles, and ſpill
blood like water; yee that can
neigh after ſtrange fleſh, and

vpon your voluptuous beds
act the filthineſſe of Sodomiticall
Aretiniſmes; yee that can
quaffe your drunken carouſes
till you haue drowned
your reaſon in a deluge of
deadly Healthes; yee whoſe
foule hands are belimed with
bribery, and beſmeared with
the price of blood; yee whoſe
ſacrilegious throats haue ſwallowed
downe whole Churches,
and Hoſpitals; whoſe
mawes haue put ouer whole
Pariſhes of ſold, and affamiſhed
ſoules; yee whoſe faction
and turbulencie in nouell opinions
rends the ſeame-leſſe
Coat, not conſidering that of
Melancthon, that Schiſme is no
leſſe ſinne then Idolatry; and
there cannot eaſily be a worſe

then Idolatry; either of them
both are enough to ruine any
Church vnder Heauen: Now
the God of Heauen euer keep
this Church of ours from the
miſchiefe of them both; yee
whoſe tongues trade in lyes,
whoſe very profeſſion is fraud
and cozenage; yee cruell Vſurers,
falſe Flatterers, lying
and enuious Detractors.
In a word, yee, who euer
yee are, that goe reſolutely
forward in a courſe of any
knowne ſinnes, and will not
bee reclaimed, yee, yee are
the men that ſpit God in the
face, and deny flatly the power
of Godlineſſe: woe is mee, we
haue enow of theſe Birds euery
where, at home. I appeale
your eyes, your eares, would

to God they would conuince
me of a ſlander.
            But what of all this now,
the power of Godlineſſe is denyed
by wicked men; How
then? what is their caſe? Surely
inexplicably, vnconceiuably
fearefull; The wrath of God
is reuealed from Heauen againſt
all vngodlineſſe▪ ſaith the Apoſtle;
How reuealed, ſay you?
wherein differ they from their
neighbours vnleſſe it be perhaps
in better fare? no gripes
in their conſcience, no afflictions
in their life, no bands in
their death, impunitas auſum, auſus
exceſſum parit, as Bernard,
Their impunitie makes them
bold, their boldneſſe outragious:
Alas, wretched Soules!
The World hath nothing

more wofull then a Sinners
welfare: It is for ſlaughter that
this Oxe is fattened; Eaſe ſlayeth
the ſimple, and the proſperitie
of fooles ſhall deſtroy them, PRO. 1.
22. This brasteata foelicitas,
which they inioy here, is but
as Carpets ſpread ouer the
mouth of Hell; For if they denie
the power of Godlineſſe, the
God of power ſhall be ſure to
denie them: Depart from me
yee workers of iniquitie, I know
you not; There cannot bee a
worſe doom, then Depart from
me; that is depart from peace,
from bleſſedneſſe, from life,
from hope, from poſſibility
of being any other then eternally,
exquiſitely miſerable;
Qui te non habet Domine Deus,
totum per didit; Hee who haith

not thee, O Lord God, hath
loſt all, as Bernard truely; dying
is but departing, but this
departing is the worſt dying;
dying in Soule, euer dying;
ſo as if there be an Ite, depart,
there muſt needs be a maledicti,
depart ye curſed; curſed that
euer they were borne, who
liue to dye euerlaſtingly: For
this departure, this curſe ends
in that fire which can neuer,
neuer end. Oh the deplorable
condition of thoſe damned
ſoules that haue ſleighted
the power of Godlineſſe? what
teares can bee enough to bewayle
their euerlaſting burnings?
what heart can bleed enough
at the thought of thoſe
tortures, which they can neither
ſuffer, nor auoyd; Hold

but your finger for one minute
in the weake flame of a
farthing Candle, can fleſh and
blood indure it? With what
horror then muſt we needes
thinke of Body and Soule frying
endleſly in that infernall
Topheth: Oh thinke of this ye
that forget Got, and contemne
Godlineſſe; with what
confuſion ſhall yee looke vpon
the frownes of an angry
God reiecting you; the vgly
and mercileſſe Fiends ſnatching
you to your torments, the
flames of Hell flaſhing vp to
meet you? with what horror
ſhall ye feele the gnawing of
your guilty conſciences, and
heare that helliſh ſhrieking,
and weeping, and wailing, and
gnaſhing? It is a paine to

mention theſe woes, it is more
then death to feele them, perhorreſeite
minas, formidate ſupplicia,
as Chryſoſtome. Certainly,
my beloued, if wicked ſinners
did truely apprehend an hell,
there would be more danger
of their deſpaire, and diſtraction,
then of their ſecuritie:
It is the Diuels policie, like a
Rauen, firſt to pull out the
eyes of thoſe that are dead in
their ſinnes, that they may not
ſee their imminent damnation.
But for vs; Tell me, yee
that heare me this day; Are ye
Chriſtians in earneſt, or are
yee not? It yee be not, what
doe yee here? If ye be, there i
                  •
               
an hell in your Creed. Ye do
not leſſe beleeue there is an
Hell for the godleſſe, then an

Earth for men, a firmament
for ſtarres, an heauen for
Saints, a God in heauen▪ And
if ye doe thus firmely beleeue,
it caſt but your eyes aſide vpon
that fierie gulfe, and ſinne
if yee dare▪ Yee loue your
ſelues well enough to auoid a
knowne paine; we know there
are Stockes, and Bride-wells,
and Iayles, and Dungeons,
and Rackes, and Gibbers, for
malefactors, and our verie
feare keeps vs innocent; were
your hearts equally aſſured of
thoſe helliſh torments, yee
could not, ye durſt not continue
in thoſe ſins, for which
they are prepared.
            But what an vnpleaſing, and
vnſeaſonable ſubiect am I fallen
vpon, to ſpeake of Hell in

a Chrſtian Court, the Emblem
of Heauen: Let me anſwer for
my ſelfe with deuout Bernard
Sic mihi contingat ſemper beare
amicos terrendo ſalubriter, non adulando
falaciter; Let me thus
euer bleſſe my friends with
wholſome frights, rather then
with plauſible ſoothings. Sumenda
ſunt amara ſalubria, ſaith
Saint Auſtin; Bitter wholſome
is a ſafe receipt for a Chriſtian;
and what is more bitter, or
more wholſome, then this
thought. The way not to feele
an Hell, is to ſee it, to feare
it▪ I feare we are all generally
defectiue this way; we doe
not retire our ſelues enough
into the Chamber of Meditation:
and thinke ſadly of the
things of another world: Our

Selfe-loue puts off this torment,
(notwithſtanding our
willing ſinnes) with Dauids
pla
                  •
               ue, non oppropinquabit, It
ſhall not come nigh thee; if wee
doe not make a league with
hell and death, yet with our
ſelues againſt them; Fallit peccatum
falſa dulcedine, as Saint
Auſtin, ſinne deceiues vs with
a falſe pleaſure, the pleaſure of
the world is like that Colchian
hony, wherof Xenophons ſoldiers
no ſooner taſted, then they
were miſerably diſtemperd;
thoſe that tooke little were
drunke, thoſe that tooke more
were mad; thoſe that tooke
moſt were dead: thus are we
either intoxicated, or infatuated,
or kild right out with this
deceitfull world, that wee are

ſenſible of our iuſt feares; at
the beſt we are beſotted with
our ſtupid ſecuritie, that wee
are not affected with our danger;
Woe, is mee the impenitent,
reſolued ſinner is alreadie
falne into the mouth of
hell, and hangs there but by
a ſlender twigge of his momentanie
life, when that hold
failes, he fals down head-long
into that pit of horror and deſolation;
Oh yee my deare
brethren, ſo many as loue
your ſoules, haue mercie vpon
your ſelues; Call aloud
out of the deeps of your ſins,
to that compaſſionate Sauiour,
that he will giue you the
hand of faith, to lay hold vpon
the hand of his mercie, and
plenteous redemption, and pull

you out of that otherwiſe irrecouerable
deſtruction; Elſe
yee are gone, yee are gone for
euer: Two things, as Bernard
borrowes of Saint Gregorie,
make a man both good, and
ſafe. To repent of euill, To abſtaine
from euill; would yee eſcape
the wrath of God, the fire
of hell? Oh waſh you cleane,
and keepe you ſo; There is no
lauer for you, but your owne
teares, and the blood of your
Sauiour; Bathe your Soules in
both of theſe, and bee ſecure;
Conſider how many are dying
now, which would giue a
world for one houre to repent
in; Oh be yee carefull then to
improue your free, and quiet
houres, in a ſerious and heartie
contrition for your ſinnes;

ſay to God with the Pſalmiſt,
Deliuer me from the euill man▪
               
that is, from my ſelfe; as that
Father conſtrues it; and for the
ſequell, in ſteed of the denying
the power of Godlineſſe, reſolue
to denie your ſelues, to
denie all vngodlineſſe and worldly
luſts, and to liue ſoberly, righteouſly,
godly in this preſent world;
that hauing felt and approued
the power of godlineſſe in the illuminating
our eyes, in rayſing
vs from our ſinnes, in eiecting
our corruptions, in
changing our liues, and creating
our hearts anew, we may
at the laſt, feele the happie
conſummation of this power,
in the full poſſeſſing of vs, in
that eternall bleſſedneſſe and
glory which he hath prepared

for all that loue him to the perfect
fruition whereof hee
bring vs that hath dearly
bought vs Ieſus
