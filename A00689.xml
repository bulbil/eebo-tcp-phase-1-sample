            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To the right worſhipfull Sir Humfrey Gilbert Knight.
            
            
               THere came to my hands of late (right vvoorſhipfull) a notable peece of vvoorke, of the Portes, and of diuers rare things bothe of the Eaſte and VVeaſt Indians, vvritten by Martin Fernandes Denciſo, aboute Anno. 1518. then Dedicated to Don Charles King of Castile, and after called in aboute tvventie yeares paſt, for that it reuealed ſecretes that the Spaniſh natiō vvas loth to haue knovven to the vvorlde. And finding in the ſame vvorke the Longitudes and Altitudes of many Ilandes, and of the Portes of the tracte of the firme lande of America, I thought good to trāſlate out of Spaniſh into Engliſh ſome parte of the ſame Calling to minde, that your vvorſhip vvas the firſte man of our nation that gaue light to our people for the finding out of the northvveſt ſtraight, and that novv you meane in proper perſon, and that at your ovvne charges, to take ſome noble voyage and diſcouerie in hande, to leaue behind you renovvne to your family, and honour and profite to your countrie: I coulde not but honour you in harte. And to make ſome ſhevv of my good vvill, I deſired much to preſent ſome thing to you, and vvas ſory that I had no notable vvorke of matter of Nauigation to Dedicate vnto you, meete for your ſo greate vvorthineſſe. But yet ſuch as this is, I dedicate it vnto you, beſechyng you moſt humbly

to take the ſame in good parte, and to vvay the good vvill of the giuer, as very greate perſons of highe honour haue done, vvhen little trifels haue bene giuen them by others of lovv degree. And Sir, albeit this ſmall gifte (in reſpect of miniſtring any knovvledge to you your ſelf) may ſeeme nothing, in that you doe vnderſtande the tongues, vvherein this and many other knovvledges of high value, lie hid from our Seamen, although not from you: yet this may for our meere Engliſh Seamen, Pilotes, Marriners, &amp;c. not acquaynted vvith forrayne tongues, bring greate pleaſure (if it fortune our Mariners or any other of our Nation, to be driuen by vvinde, tempeſte, currents, or by other chaunce to any of the Ilandes, Portes, Hauens, Bayes or Forelandes mencioned in this Pamphlet,) and ſo it may alſo in the voyage, be a meane to keepe them the more frō idleneſſe, the Nurce of villany, and to giue them alſo right good occaſion by vvay of example, vpon any nevv Diſcouerie, to take the Altitude and Latitude, to ſet dovvne the tracte of the Ilandes, the natures of the ſoyles, and to note the qualitie of the ayre, the ſeuerall benefites that the Soyles and the Riuers yeelde, vvith all the diſcomodities and vvantes that the ſame places haue, and if our Countrie men fortune the rather to be avvaked out of their heauy ſleepe vvherein they haue long lien, and the rather hereby be occaſioned to ſhunne beſtiall ignoraunce, and vvith other nations rather late than neuer to make thēſelues ſhine vvith the brightneſſe of knovvledge, let them giue Sir Humfrey Gilbert the thankes, for vvhoſe ſake I tranſlated the ſame.

And thus committing your vvorſhip to the greate Neptune, the greate God of the Chriſtians that ruleth lande and Sea, I leaue you to your voyage, and to the gouernment of that mightie God, vvho neuer plāted in any man ſo hie courage, vvith ſo much deſire to greate attempts, but to ſome greate end, as heretofore in many hath bene ſeene, and as the ſequele in your happie ſucceſſes no doubt ſhall be founde, as England and the vvhole vvorld ſhall out of queſtion vvitneſſe.

            A brief deſcription of the Portes Creekes, Bayes, and Hauens of the Weaſt India.
            
               FRom the Ilande called Fierro, vnto the Ilande of ſaint Nicholas, are twoo hundreth leagues: the Iland of ſaint Nicholas lieth South Southweaſt, and from thence to the Ilande called Fuego are .xl. leagues: that Iland lieth directly South, and from thence to the Cape of S. Iuſtin, whiche ſtandeth in the other ſide of the Equinoctiall line, are foure hundred leagues. The cape of S. Auſtin lieth South Southweaſt, with the The cape of ſaynt Auſtin. Iland called Fuego, &amp; ſtandeth in eight degrees on the other ſide of the Equinoctiall towardes the South: and from the Cape of S. Auſtin vnto the gulfe &amp; riuer of S. Francis are The riuer of ſaynt Francis. fortie fiue leagues, the coaſt lieth ſouthweaſt: the riuer of ſaint Francis ſtandeth in ten degrees towardes the ſouth: this is a good porte &amp; it hath a good riuer. From that riuer vnto the The Bay. Bay of all Sayntes are ſeuentie leagues: the Baye lieth Southweſt, &amp; by ſouth, in .xiij. degrees, and there remayneth in the middeſt porte Roiall, whiche is a good porte, and hath good riuers. The Bay of al Saints hath within it certain litle Ilandes, and within theſe are twoo good riuers. In the direction towardes the coaſt, the lande lieth lowe, and the people are naked, &amp; eate bread of rootes. It is a baren countrie. From the Bay of all Saintes to the porte called Seguro are .lxxx. leagues, the coaſt lying ſouth &amp; by weaſt. Porte Seguro ſtandeth .m. xvij. degrees, this is a porte and a Riuer, and it is a good porte. From porte Seguro vnto the cape which is beyond Golfo Formoſo, that is to ſay, the fayre gulfe, are one hundreth and ten leagues, and the coaſt lieth ſouth ſouthweaſt: and betweene theſe twoo are many dry and ſhallowe places, whiche

lieth on ſea borde .xx. and .xxx. leagues: and paſſing them, you ſhall finde neare the land barres, and ſholdes, which haue vpō them three or foure fadome water of deapth, and neare towardes the ende of the ſholdes, ſtandeth the gulfe of Saint Thome, whereunto adioyneth the gulfe of Barroſas. 
               Saynt Thome.
            
            And paſſing thoſe ſhallow places, there lieth cape Formoſo, that is to ſay, the fayre cape, in .xxij. degrees and a halfe: and beyng paſte the fayre cape, there appeareth a gulfe betweene two landes, and it ſeemeth to haue a league in breadth, and three or foure in length: and at the ende therof is the riuer called Delgado, this is a good porte, a good coūtrie, and good people, although that they be naked. From this gulfe to Cape Frio, that is to ſay, the colde cape, are .xvj. leagues: cape Frio ſtandeth in .xxiij. degrees and a halfe, this cape hath before it an Iland adioyning, and the fayre cape an other, &amp; betwene theſe other little Ilands. From the colde Cape the coaſt doth turne to the Northweaſt and by North .xxv. leagues, &amp; from thence it turneth Northeaſt other .xx. leagues, and maketh the Colde cape lyke to an Iland: and betweene him and the lande there is a good gulfe, with many ſmall Ilandes in the Cold Cape. middeſt: and frō this gulfe vnto the gulfe of the Mangues are xx. leagues. That of the Mangues hath two Ilands at the end of it, and it is great, &amp; hath .xx. leagues at the mouth. From this gulf vnto the riuer of S. Francis are .lxxv. leagues. And that of ſaint Francis lieth Southweaſt in .xxv. degrees, and before that of ſaynt Francis lieth the riuer of the Cananca, whiche is a good riuer, and in the middeſt of this coaſt lieth the cape of ſaint Sebaſtian, which entreth foure leagues into the ſea, and towardes the Eaſte parte of it, ſtandeth the porte of Saynt Sebaſtian. 
               Gregorio: and to the weaſt parte lieth the porte of Terrerias, which is a good gulfe, and bath an Iland in the middeſt. All this coaſt hath many litle Ilands before it. From the porte of ſaynt Francis vnto the riuer Delas Bueltas, that is to ſay, the croked riuer, are .lx. leagues, the coaſt lieth South, the croked riuer ſtandeth in .xxix. degrees, and neare to the riuer of ſaynt

Francis toward the land lieth an Iland, which hath in lēgth xxv. leagues, and towarde the lande he ſeemeth in circle oblique: and rounde aboute the ſame is the Sea, and hath 
                  〈◊〉
                leagues in breadth: and towardes the 
                  ••
               rme lande lieth the gulfe and riuer called Reparo, and the riuer of Bayadas. From the crooked riuer vnto the Cape ſaint Mary are .lxxx. leagues. The cape ſaynt Mary ſtandeth in .xxxv. degrees, and a little paſt this cape, entreth in a riuer more than twentie leagues of breadth, where be people that do eate mans fleſh. This coaſt is al full of ſholdes. And before cape ſaynt Mary are certaine ſmall Ilandes. In all theſe coaſtes from cape ſaynt Mary vnto cape ſaint Auſtin groweth muche Braſill and little other thing of any profite in it.
            And ſeing that we haue ſpoken of the coaſt that lieth from the cape of ſaynt Auſtin towardes the pole Antartike: let vs returne to ſpeake of that whiche is towardes the parte of the pole Artike, whiche is called the North pole. I ſay that from the cape of ſaynt Auſtin vnto the riuer Marauon are three hundreth leagues: Marauon lieth weaſt, in ſeuen degrees Marauon. and a halfe, it is a greate riuer, and hath more than .xv. leagues in breadth, and ryght leagues within the land. It hath many Ilandes, and in this riuer within the lande .xl. leagues, there is neare to the ſayd riuer a Mountaine, wherevpon groweth trees of Incenſe, the trees be of a good height, &amp; the bowes be like to Plum trees, &amp; the Incenſe doth hang at them, as the yet doth at the tyles of a houſe in the winter ſeaſon when it dothe freeſe. In this riuer were taken foure Indians in a ſmall boate called in the Indian language a Canoa, that came downe by the riuer, and there was takē from them two ſtones of Emeralds, the one of them being as great as a mans hand▪ They ſayde that ſo many dayes iourney goyng vpwarde by the riuer, they founde a rocke of that ſtone. In likewiſe there was takē from them two loa

               ed with the licour of Balſamo. All this coaſte

from the cape of ſaynt Auſtin vnto Maranon is a cleare coaſt and deepe, but neare to the riuer are certaine ſholdes towards the Eaſt parte. And by the weaſt part the riuer is deepe, and it hath a good entrie. From this riuer Maranon, vnto the riuer whiche is called the Sea of freſh water, art .xxv. leagues: The Sea of freshe vvater. this riuer hath .lx. leagues of breadth at the mouth, and carieth ſuche great aboundance of water, that it entereth more than xx. leagues into the Sea, and mingleth not it ſelfe with the ſalte water: this breadth goeth .xxv. leagues within the land, and after it is deuided into partes, the one going towards the ſoutheaſt, and the other towardes the ſouthweſt. That which goeth towards the ſouthweaſt is very deepe and of much water, and hath a chanell half a league of breadth, that a Carrake may goe vp through it: and the tydes be ſo ſwifte, that the ſhippes haue neede of good cabels. The ryuer of this porte is very good, and there haue bene ſome that haue entered fiftie leagues within it, and haue ſeene no Mountaynes. The Indians of this countrey haue their lippes made full of ſmall holes in foure partes, and through thoſe holes be put ſmall rings, and likewiſe at their eares: and if any man aſke of thē where they had their golde, they anſwere, that goyng vp by the riuer ſo many dayes iourney, they found certaine mountaynes that had much of it, and from thoſe mountaynes they brought it when they would haue it, but they made no great accōpt of it, for they neither buy nor ſell, and amongſt them is nothing but chaunge. In this countrey they eate bread of rootes, and Maiz, and they eate certaine rootes whiche they call Aies and Batatas, but the Batatas be better than the other rootes, and beyng rawe they haue a ſmell of Cheſtnuts: they are to be eatē roſted. Theſe Indians do make wine of ye fruite of Date trees, which fruite is yellow in colour, &amp; is as great as a litle Doues egge, and being in ſeaſon is good to be eaten, and of him proceedeth good wine, and is preſerued for a long time. Theſe kinde of people doe make their houſes with vpper rowmes, and they ſleepe in them, as alſo all their habitation

is in the vpper rowmes, and that whiche is alowe, they leaue it open: and alſo they vſe certayne mantels of cotton wooll, and theſe they tie at the endes with ropes, and the one ende of the rope they make faſt to one parte of the houſe, and the other ende to the other parte of the houſe: and in theſe they lie, and be their beddes, and theſe kinde of beddes be vſed in all the Occidentall India, and there is not in any parte of India any chambers that the people do vſe to lodge in aloft from the ground, nor they make any high rowmes, but onely in this parte of India, and in all other places they make their houſes without any loftes or chambers, and they couer their houſes with the leaues of Date trees, and of graſſe. And from this freſh water Sea vnto Paria, the coaſt lieth weaſt northweaſt, and all full of ſholdes that the ſhippes can not come neare to the land. There is from this riuer to Paria twoo hundreth and fiftie leagues. In this freſhe water ſea, the tydes doe ebbe and flowe as much as they do in Brytayne, and ſtandeth in ſixe degrees and halfe.
Paria ſtandeth on the other ſide of the Equinoctiall towarde the North, in ſeuen degrees: In Paria 
               Paria. the ſea floweth but little, and from Paria towardes the weaſt the ſea dothe not flowe. From the entery of the gulfe of Paria vnto the cape that litth towardes the weaſt, are thirtie fiue leagues, &amp; from thence the coaſt turneth towardes the northeaſt, other .xxxv. leagues, and from thence the coaſt turneth towardes the weaſt. Before this gulfe ſtandeth the Ilande The Trinitie. of the Trinitie, and towardes the weaſt dothe appeare the gulfe of Paria like to half a round Circle, after the faſhion of a Diametre: and at the ende of this circle is the entery in of Paria, and at this entrie there is betweene the land and the Iland right leagues, &amp; on the other ſide there is but little ſpace betweene the Iland and the lande, but it is deepe, and hath a good entrie: this Ilande of the Trinitie hath in length .xxv. leagues, and as many in breadth, &amp; ſtandeth in. viij▪ degrees, and is inhabited of many people, and as yet not vnder ſubiection. Here the Indians do vſe to ſhoote with bowes, and arrowes

whiche are of a fadom in length, made of reedes, which grow in that countrie, and at the ende of them is artificially wyned a peece of wood very ſtrong, vnto the whiche peece of woodde at the ende of it, they put a bone of a fiſh, in place of an arrow head: theſe kinde of bones be harder than Diamōdes and euery one of them be three or foure fingers long, and they are taken out of a fiſh that hath three of theſe bones, one vpon the backe, and one vnder euery wing: but that which groweth vpon the backe is the ſtrongeſt and the greateſt. In this Iland the people ſayeth that there groweth golde, and in this Ilande and in Paria groweth reedes ſo great, that they make ſtaues of thē, and carry of them into Spayne. Likewiſe there be Popingayes very great and gentle, and ſome of them haue their foreheades yellowe, and this ſorte doe quickly learne to ſpeake, and ſpeake muche. There be likewiſe in the gulfe of Paria pearles, although not many, but very good and greate. Paria hath many Ilandes towardes the north parte of it, vntill you come to the Iland of ſaint Christopher, and frō ſaint Chriſtopher, to the Iland called Eſpanola, be other Ilands that lieth towards the Northeaſt. The names of theſe Ilands are as foloweth: The firſte and neareſt Ilande to Paria is called the Iland of Mayo, this is but a ſmall Ilande: there is a fruyte growing in it that the caſke of it ſmelleth like to Beniamyn: The Ilande of Mayo. likewiſe there is Roſine in certayne trees, whiche they vſe for Incenſe, and Aimaſticke. This Iland ſtādeth in ten degrees and a halfe: the Iland of Tabaco in ten: Santa Lucia and the Aſſention in xj. degrees and a halfe: the Baruada in .xij. degrees: Martinino in .xij. degrees and a halfe: the Dominica in .xiij. and a halfe: Gwadalupe and the Deceada in xv. degrees: Monſerate and the Antigua in .xvj. degrees: Baruada in .xvij.

In all theſe Ilandes they ſay there is golde: in that of Gwadalupe hath bene golde found and gathered, but by reaſon they be not in ſubiection, there is no certaintie of it. The Iland of ſaynt Iohn is a good Iland, and Saynt Iohn. it hath two good portes: one of them ſtandeth towardes the north, whiche is called porte Rico, and the towne that is in it is of Chriſtians, and it is a good towne, although that it is not great: and the other is called ſaynt German, in this Iland is gathered much golde, and all is fine golde: this Iland is xxx. leagues long and lieth Eaſt &amp; Weaſt, and in breadth twentie. From this Ilande to the Ilande called Eſpanola are xvj. leagues, and the Ilande called the Mona, ſtandeth well neare in the middeſt betweene bothe, whiche is a little Iland. The Iland called Eſpanalo. At the beginning of the lande called Eſpanola is the Cape of Higuei, whiche ſtandeth in .xx. degrees: from this cape of Higuei, vnto the cape of Tiburon, which is the cape and ende of the Iland, are one hundreth and ſixtie leagues: they lie eaſt and weaſt: from the cape of Higuei vnto the Saona, whiche is neare to the entring in at the porte of Higuei, are .xv. leagues.

               Acuia to the Beata are twentie leagues. The Beata ſtandeth from Acuia Southweaſt in xix. degrees. From the Beata to Yaquimo are fiue and twentie leagues. From Yaquimo to the Cauana are fourtie leagues. Yaquimo and the Cauana lieth in twentie degrees. From the Cauana lieth out a cape from the lande into the Sea towardes the South, cyght leagues, and from thence the coaſt turneth Weaſt Northweaſt vnto cape Tiburon. There is from one cape to the other .xxv. leagues. Before the Cauana ſtandeth an Iland which is called

                and betweene it and the Cauana is ſholde, and the chanell lieth neare to the lande, &amp; an other lieth at the end of the Iland. From the cape of Tiburon the coaſt turneth towardes the Eaſt vnto Yaragua three ſcore and ten leagues, vntill it come neare to the Iland of Guanabon. In this three ſcore and tenne leagues the Iland called Eſpanola hath not in breadth more than twentie or two and twentie leagues. From Yaragua the coaſt turneth towardes the Northweaſt and by North, vnto the cape of ſaynt Nicholas. There is from Yaragua to the cape of ſaynt Nicholas fiftie and fiue leagues, and the cape of ſaint Nicholas beyng doubled, the coaſt turneth towardes the eaſt vnto porte Roiall: and from the cape of ſaint Nicholas to port Roiall be fifty leagues. This porte Roiall is the beſt porte of the Ilande ſauyng that it is out of the way of all trade, and therefore they go not to it. From porte Roiall to the porte of Plata, are fiue and thirtie leagues: from the porte of Plata to the Cape de Cierpe, are fourtie leagues: the coaſte lieth Eaſt Southeaſt. From the Cape of Cierpe vnto the cape of Higuei are eight and twentie leagues. And from the Cape of Higuei to the cape of Tiburon are one hundreth and eightie leagues, and that is the length of this Ilande. It hath in breadth from the Beata to porte Roiall ninetie leagues: the

South parte of it ſtandeth in .xix. and .xx. degrees: the North parte in .xxiiij. This Ilād is inhabited with Chriſtiās. There is gathered in it much gold: there cōmeth euery yeare frō this Iland to Castile, 400000. Castellanos &amp; more, euery Castellano is worth .vij. ſhillings of our money of Englād. It is a countrie of much fleſhe, and alſo of much freſhe fiſhe: the cattayle do multiply much, bycauſe there is no kinde of vermine that do hurt them. In al this Iland the Kine and Mares do bring forth yong ones, once euery yeare, and the yong Mares and The manners of the Ilande called Eſpanola. yong Kine be with fole when they be but a yeare and a halfe olde. The graſſe is alwayes greene and neuer waxeth drye: the trees be alwayes greene, with their leaues as they be here in the moneth of May and Iune. They eate bread of a roote which they call Caſaui. There be other rootes like to Turneps, whiche be called Aies, and alſo Batatas, but the Batatas be better, and there be fieldes ful of them as be here of ſowen fieldes. There is alſo a fruyte which is called Pinas, whiche be of the makyng of a Pine apple, but they be greater: the trees that beareth them be lyke to the Canes or ſtockes of Lillies, and Flure de Luces. Whē they be in ſeaſon they turne yellow like to waxe: the ſmell of it is ſo much &amp; ſo ſweete, yt it ſmelleth in all ye houſe where they be. It is of a maruelous goodly ſauour although that the taſt of it be ſomwhat egre. There is alſo an other fruit of trees which is called Mameis, which is as great, &amp; like to a Doues egge, of a tawny colour, being within three kernels, the meate of it is like to a Peach, ſomewhat red. The people of this Ilande were Idolaters &amp; naked, although that now they be turned Chriſtians. The womē do weare a kind of apparel, which they call there Naguas, made in ſuch ſorte, that it couereth them from the waſte to the knees: and they which be Virgines, go naked as they were borne: &amp; when any woman hath loſte bir Virginitie, immediately ſhe doth couer hir ſelf, and if ſhe haue no Naguas, ſhe putteth before hir a leafe tied on with threedes made of Cotton woll, wherwith ſhe couereth hir Secretes, and that leafe they call there Pampanillia.
               
and when any of theſe women are with childe, or giue ſucke to any childe, there is no man that will company with hir for any thing in the worlde: they ſay it is ſinne to company with hir at that time. And when any woman is with childe, hir huſband taketh an other vntill his wife be deliuered of hir childe, and as long as ſhe giueth ſucke: and when any man dieth that is of eſtimation, they did make a greate hole in the ground, where they vſed to put him in, and they put him in ſitting: and put in alſo with him both meate and drynke, and they couer the hole with timber and with earthe, and lefte open a ſtraight mouth, where a man mighte goe in: to theſe came their wiues, and ſuch as loued them well, and went in to him, and put in meate, and after that they were entered in, the mouth was couered with timber and earth: and ſo they were lefte all within, and they ſayde that they wente to beare him company to the other world, where they ſhould haue better cheere and more pleaſure. And now there is in this Iland many townes of Chriſtians, the principall towne is Sancto Domingo, where is a good porte and ryuer: and likewiſe there is the beſt trade of all the Ilande: &amp; this is towardes the ſouth parte: &amp; at the north parte is the porte of Plata: but the towne is little, and the porte is not very good: and by this meanes the trade is litle. In this Iland be many moūtaines of Salte, and rockes of Salte. From the cape of Saint Nicholas to the Iland of Cuba are. xiiij leagues: the Iland of Cuba lieth weſt, it hath in length two hundereth and twentie leagues: and in 
                  Cuba.
                breadth by the cape de Crus fiftie leagues, and by the other partes by ſome wayes thirtie leagues, and other ſome twenty. It is a good Iland: and in it is much victuall, and much wilde foule, Pigeons, Geeſe and Partriche, and many Popingayes. The countrey is full of Mountaynes, there is gathered in it much golde, although that it is not ſo fine as that of the Iland called Eſpanola. The people be idolaters, the one parte of it is inhabited with Chriſtians. The ende of the land which ſtandeth next to the cape of ſaynt Nicholas is in .xxiiij.

degrees and a halfe, and that which lieth towardes the weaſt, is in .xxvij. degrees. The poynt of the cape de Crus is .xxiij. degrees. Cape de Crus. This Iland of Cuba hath at the north parte of it aboue two hundreth ſmall Ilandes, and they be all inhabited with Small Ilandes. people, which people be not very blacke, &amp; be of a good growth both the men and alſo the women: but there is no fleſh to eate in theſe Ilandes: their meate is fiſhe, rootes, and bread made of rootes, and the blades of graſſe: and if any of the people be caried to other places, if they doe giue them fleſhe to eate, immediatly they die, if the fleſh which they eate be not very litle in quantitie. Towarde the ſouth parte of Cuba, is the Ilande called Iamayca, and this of Iamayca, lieth weaſt from the cape of Tiburon. There is from the cape of Tiburon, which is in the Iland of Spanola vnto Iamaica. xx. leagues, and in the middeſt Iamayca. betweene both lieth the Nauaca, whiche is a little ſmall rocky Iland, beyng plaine and vnprofitable. Iamaica lieth Eaſt, and Weaſt, it hath in length fiftie leagues, and in breadth .xxv. it is a fruytefull Ilande, and hath muche corne growing in it, and hath all kinde of victuall, ſuch as they vſe to eate, whiche ſuffiſeth their neceſſitie, and groweth vpon the ſame Ilande: there is much cattel, and many trees of cotton wooll: they gather much Cotton wool in it, wherof they make ſtore of cloth, but there is no golde: there is alſo great aboundance of Fiſhe. And there be a certayne kinde of little beaſtes, that haue the ſnoute and tayle like to a Ratte, and the body like to a Coney, and theſe be called Hutias, whoſe fleſhe is good to eate, and there are multitudes of them. From the ende of the Ilande of Cuba towardes the Northweaſt, hath appeared a great countrie, it is thought to be a firme lande. And ſeyng that we haue ſpoken of the Ilandes, lette vs returne to the coaſt of Paria, 
               Paria. where we began to ſpeake of the Ilandes: I ſay, after that you goe from Paria, the coaſt of the lande turneth toward the Weaſt: there is from the mouth of the gulfe of Paria vnto the cape that ſtandeth vppon the gulfe of Alioſar ſeuentie fiue leagues: the gulfe of Alioſar lieth Weaſt and by North, in

nine degrees and a halfe, and there remayneth in the middeſt the gulfe of all Sayntes: neare to the gulfe of all Sayntes towardes the weaſt there entereth a cape of a lande into the Sea three leagues: and neare to this Cape towardes the North eight leagues into the ſea, there be Ilandes and rockes called the Friers, which be a company of ſmall Ilandes lyke to rockes. And towardes the Weaſt parte from the Friers is the Ilande called Margarita, whiche is an Ilande that hath xx. leagues from the Eaſt to the Weaſt: and from the North Margarita pearles. to the South .xij. Round aboute al this Iland are fiſhed fine pearles, in great quantitie. And in the gulfe of Aliofar, they fiſhe pearles alſo, but in this Ilande be more quantitie, and greater, and towardes the South ſide are moſte and greateſt: and the Cape of Aliofar beyng doubled, a gulfe of Sea doth returne betweene twoo landes towardes the Eaſt, more than fiue and twentie leagues of breadth: in this gulfe be fiſhed many pearles, and muche Aliofar: the ſhelles wherein they breede be lyke to Cockle ſhelles, but they be greater and brighter within them, lyke to the ſelfe ſame pearles, but without they be of the colour of cockles: they fiſhe greate quantitie of them. From the ende of the gulfe Aliofar vnto the Cape whiche ſtandeth vpon the porte Flechado called Tucuraca, he ſoure ſcore leagues: Tucuraca ſtandeth in nine degrees and a halfe, and there remayneth in the middeſt the cape of ſmall Ilandes, and before it is the porte called Solo, and the porte called Canafiſtola, and after him is porte Flechado, and hath many Ilāds before him: al this coaſt is of much fiſhing, and in it are trees of Canafistola, which doth bring forth there Canes ſo great as a great Launce, and are very good. And as it hath aboundance of ſubſtaunce, it dothe putrifie ſooner than that which we haue here. The portes Flechado and Canafiſtola ſtandeth in eight degrees. This countrey hath much victuall: Cana fiſtola. there is in it many Popingayes, Pearles, &amp; Aliofar. The Indians of this countrey do vſe to ſhoote with bowes, &amp; their arrowes be a fadom long: there are growyng great recdes as

big as a good ſtaffe. Frō 
               Tucuraca to the cape of ſaynt Roman are xlv. leagues. The cape of Saint Roman ſtandeth Southweaſt and by South, in .xj. degrees: the cape of ſaynt Roman entreth into the ſea .xx. leagues, and the lande is not paſt three or foure leagues broade, and towarde the caſt lieth the port of Coriana: and towardes the weaſt porte of the Pico, they be good portes. There are from them to the cape twentie leagues, they are in ten degrees. From the cape of ſaynt Roman vnto the cape of Coquibacoa are three ſmall Ilandes Trianglewyſe, betweene theſe twoo capes is one gulfe of ſea in ſhape foure ſquare, and at the cape of Coquibacoa entereth in frō this gulfe an other little gulfe within the lande foure leagues, and at the Coquibacoa. ende of him neare to the lande there lieth a great rocke, which rocke is plaine vpon the toppe, and vpō it ſtandeth a village of houſes of Indians whiche is called Veneciuela, and it ſtandeth Veneciuela. in ten degrees. Betwene this gulfe of Veneciuela and the cape of Coquibacoa, the water turneth within the lande towardes the Weaſt, and in this turne ſtandeth Coquibacoa. Here hath bene founde wayght, and touche for golde, in the Towne, whiche is great: and the Indians doe ſay that they bryng the golde from within the lande, xxv. leagues, and when they goe thither they carry with them the waight &amp; the touch, whereby they know what they bring. In all the Weaſt India hath not bene found waight, but in this place. The towne of Coquibacoa is greate, and a good towne, and of good peaceable people. In Veneciuela be people of a tall growth: and there are goodlier women than are in any other parte of that countrey. There are good Pearles, and well growen, although not ſo many as in the Margarita. Here the Indians do vſe Laū
               ces of .xxv. foote long, and things to ſhoote withall like to dartes. From the Cape of Coquibacoa, vnto the cape Dela Vela are .xl. leagues. The cape Dela vela lieth weaſt northweſt in Cape Dela vela. xij. degrees &amp; a halfe and neare to this cape Dela vela is a good port, with a little Iland before it, which lieth weaſt: &amp; beyng paſt cape Dela vela the coaſt turneth ſouth &amp; by weaſt, &amp; lieth

lowe, and likewiſe all the land from the cape Dela Vela is low lande. From the cape Dela Vela to Tucuraca are .xxx. leagues: Tucuraca ſtandeth in .xj. degrees and a halfe, &amp; is a good porte. Frō 
               Tucuraca to Sancta Marta are .xxv. leagues: Sancta Marta lieth weaſt in. xj degrees and a halfe, and is a good porte: Tucuraca. it hath a ſmall Ilande before it, &amp; is the beſt porte of all this coaſt. This countrey of Sancta Marta is a countrey that is watered by ſluces, and the corne and things which they ſowe Sancta Marta. and plant, they doe water, with their owne labour: it is an open grounde, and hath hight mountaynes, and without any thing growing in them. The ſande of the riuers is altogether ſtony ſande, of the colour of golde, and it ſheweth as though that it were al gold. There are in this Ilande many Hogges, and much Deare. There is found in the powre of the Indians, much gold and coper, and alſo much gilt Coper. The Indians do ſay that they gilte the Coper with an hearbe that groweth in that countrey, whiche beyng ſtamped, and the iuyce taken out, and the Coper beyng waſhed therewith and put to the fire, it turneth to the colour of moſt fine gold, and it riſeth more or leſſe in colour, accordyng to the quātitie of the hearbe that is put to it. The people be fearce and warlike, they vſe bowes, and their arrowes be little bigger than quarrels, which they annoynt with an hearbe that is ſo full of poyſon, that it is a great chaunce (when they hit any man) if he eſcape, beyng wounded with that hearbe: one of the things wherewith they make that hearb, are certaine apples which be in that coūtrey, Appels of poyſon. &amp; are of the greatneſſe and colour of the wilde Apples of this coūtrie. The tree that doth carry them is like to a ſmall Peare tree of this coūtrie. As ſone as any mā hath eaten one of thē, immediatly it turneth to wormes within his body, whiche grow ſo great &amp; eate ſo muche of the bodie, that they kill him: this is knowen to be ſo by reaſon. I cauſed it to be experimented, in one that was giuen to a Dogge to eate, whiche within foure houres was turned all into wormes in the body, and ſo we found it when we cauſed the Dogge to be opened, for to

ſee the effect of the Apple. And if any man do put himſelfe vnder one of theſe trees in the ſhadowe, immediatly his head beginneth to ake: &amp; if he do continue there long, his face beginneth to ſwell, &amp; to trouble his ſight: and if by chaunce he ſleepe vnder the tree, immediatly he loſeth his ſight: all this I haue ſeene by experience. Before you come to Sancta Marta there is Yaharo, which is in the ſide of the ſnowie mountaynes. Yaharo as a good port and ſtandeth in a good countrey: and there Yaharo. be Orchardes of trees of diuers ſortes of fruytes to be eaten, &amp; among them there is one like to Oringes, &amp; when the fruite is in ſeaſon to be eaten it turneth yellow, and the meate that is within it is like to butter: It hath a good ſauour, and hath the taſt ſo good &amp; ſo ſoft, that it is maruelous. The moūtaines that lie full of Snow, beginne from Sancta Marta: and neare to Yaharo is the higheſt parte of them, and they ſhew vpon the toppes as white as if they were Snowe, and from thence they reache to Veneciuela, and ſo into the countrey within, it is not Moūtayns vvith Snovve. knowen how farre, for that the coūtrie is not yet in ſubiectiō, nor the Indians do giue any more reaſon of them, but that they reache very farre into the countrie. This Mountayne is vpō the toppe playne, and there be many townes of Indians vpō it, and many lakes of ſtanding water. In Sancta Marta is gathered much Cotton wooll, and the Indians do make ſtore of clothe of it, whiche is a thing to be ſeene, and they make it of many colours: they do make of Popingayes fethers, Pecocks and of other birdes which be in that countrey, certaine things like to Diademes, very great, that the gētlewomen do put on their heades, which things hang downe vpon their ſhoulders in one peece vnto their girdle: like to the ends of a biſhops Mitre: &amp; this is ſo well wrought, that it is maruell to ſee the diuerſitie of the colours, and the worke, and the arte thereof: and as the colours be naturall and of themſelues, they ſhewe ſo wel, that no artificiall worke of ſuch as is wrought here, is ſo good nor ſo acceptable vnto the ſight. From Sancta Marta the coaſt turneth ſouth .xx. leagues: and in the turnyng cape

of Sancta Marta ſtandeth Garia, where be a naughty kinde of people: and righte before this wilde countrey entreth into Garia. a Riuer very greate, whiche goeth from the Mountaynes that lie full of Snowe: and he is ſo greate, that thys water entreth a greate way into the Sea without any minglyng of it ſelfe with the ſalte water: and from thence the coaſt lieth Weaſt, vnto the porte of Zamba. Zamba is a good porte, and ſtandeth in eleuen degrees and a halfe. From Sancta Marta to Zamba be fiue and twentie leagues: the lande of this coaſte is playne, and lowe without Mountaynes, and it is all very fayre medowe grounde, and a countrie well inhabited: the menne haue their heare cutte, the women goe couered from the waſte downeward. They are good people and burte no bodie, but ſuche as doe hurte them firſte. Zamba hath towardes the Weaſt parte of it foure Ilandes of ſandes, whiche lyeth neare the lande, and rounde aboute them be ſholdes: they reache tenne leagues into the Ilandes of Sandes. Sea, but betweene them and the lande where the Cape De Loyo delo gato ſtandeth, there may paſſe ſhippes from Zamba vnto the Cape of Canoa whiche is twoo leagues. From Carta gena be twenty leagues, and they be all ſholdes of the Ilandes of ſandes. Before the Cape of Canoa there is a rocke whiche ryſeth a little aboue the water, whiche rocke they call Canoa, but by reaſon it is ſeene, it is not daungerous. And a little before aboute twoo leagues from thence, are the portes of Carta gena The portes of Carta gena haue an Iland The portes of Carta gena. in the myddeſt, whiche ſtandeth not out of the compaſſe of the other lande, and by the one and the other ſide of thys Ilande, there is a porte, but that of the Eaſte parte hath the better entrie, the Ilande is called Gnodego: hee hath twoo leagues in length, and halfe a league in breadth, and is well inhabited of Indians beyng fiſher menne. The people of this Countrey be tall, but bothe menne and women goe all naked as they were borne: they are warrelyke people, and vſe bowes and arrowes: they ſhoote all their artowes

wyth a naughty hearbe, and the women doe lykewyſe fighte as well as the menne. I had pryſoner a gyrle of eyghten or twentie yeares of age, who dyd affirme that ſhe had kylled eyght Chriſtian menne before ſhee was taken pryſoner. In this place groweth the hearbe Iperboton, 
               Iperboton▪
                wherewith they heale the woundes of the hearbe whiche is poyſon, and with thys Hearbe they ſay that Alexander healed Ptholome. In this Countrey and towardes the Weaſt partes the Indians doe eate breade of the grayne of Maiz, grounde: and they make of it good bread, whiche is of muche ſubſtaunce: and of the ſelfe ſame meale of Maiz beyng ſodden in kettels and great tinages in muche water, they make wyne to drynke: and it is wyne o
                  •
                much ſubſtaunce, good, and of a good ſauour. The Indians doe vſe to drynke a greate cuppe full of it when they ryſe in the mornyng without eatyng any thyng elſe with it, and therewith they goe to theyr dayly laboures, and be there labouryng the greateſt parte of the day, without eatyng any other thyng. The Chriſtians that are in that Countrey doe vſe the lyke, and they ſay that it is there in that Countrie: and a manne endureth to laboure with it all one daye without eatyng any other thyng, if he drynke twoo tymes thereof.
            The hearbe Iperboton wherewith they heale the hearbe that is poyſon, they ſay that the iuyce of hys toote is as good for the ſighte as for to heale the hearbe of poyſon, and that there is of it in Carmania, and in the Mountayne Atalantes, whiche are in the coaſte of Getulia. In this countrey of Carta Gena is in the power of the Indians muche Copper▪ and there is lykewiſe golde, but not muche: and they ſay that twentie leagues from that Countrie towardes the Southweaſt is muche golde, and whoſoeuer will may goe thither for it.

vnto the Ilandes of Baru be ten leagues: betweene theſe of Baru and the land may paſſe ſhippes if they be not very great, and beyng paſte theſe Ilandes of Baru, more towardes the Weaſt is the porte of Cenu, which is a great Baye, and hath his entry by the Eaſt part, and it is a good ſure porte. There is Cenu. from Carta gena, to Cenu. xxv. leagues: Carta gena lieth Eaſt in ten degrees and a halfe, and Cenu towardes the Weaſt in ix. degrees: in that of Cenu they make muche Salte: the people be ſtrong and warlike: they vſe bowes, and their arrowes be ſet with poyſon. Ill men and womē goe naked. When any man of great auctoritie dye, or any chylde of hys, they take their guttes out of their bodies, and waſhe them with certaine thyngs, and annoynt them, and vpon them they put Cotton wooll, died with diuers colours, whiche they put againe into the bodie, and beyng coloured therwith, they put them into a bedde made after the faſhiō of the beddes of that countrey, and they hang him vp in the houſe, neare to the place where they make their fire: and ſo they keepe him It happened to me, that I tooke a towne called Catarapa, where we founde more than xx. that were hanged after this ſort in the houſes. In this coū
               trey of Cenu is much golde in the power of the Indians, &amp; very fine, and it is myngled and hath his foundation of Siluer, and there is no parte of it Copper, whiche the Indians doe ſay they bryng from certayne Mountaynes, from whence the ryuer of Cenu doth come forth, from certayne places that they call Mocri, and an other Cubra, and an other Cud

I toke an Indian Gentleman priſoner, yt ſayd to me, that he had

gone to this place three times, and had ſeene it gathered after that ſort, and alſo that he himſelfe had gathered it. This countrey of Cenu hath great ſtore of vittayle growen in the Countrey. Their bread and Wyne is made of the meale of Maiz, as it is in Carta Gena. Likewiſe there be rootes, whereof they make bread, as in the Iland of Cuba, and Iamaica, and the Eſpanola, but it is of another qualitie: for that of the Ilandes is naught, and if any do eate of it, he dyeth, as though he had eaten Arnike: and alſo if any beaſt eate of it, or drink of the water that commeth out of it, he dyeth. And to make bread of it, they grate it, and after they preſſe it, and when it remayneth as drye as powder, they make bread of it: and that which groweth in this Citie of Cenu, and in all ye Countrey heereabout, they eate them rawe, and roſted, for they are very good to be ſo eaten, and of a good ſauoure.
            
               A Proteſtation.
               I Did require two Indian Gentlemē of Cenu, in the behalfe of the King of Caſtile, that they ſhoulde be ſubiect to the Kyng of Caſtile, and that he woulde giue them to vnderſtande, that there was one God alone, whyche was three perſons in one, and did require them, that they woulde leaue vnto him that Countrey, ſeeyng that it did apperteyne to hym: and if they would liue in it as they were, that they ſhould giue to him the obedience, as vnto their Lord, and alſo ſhoulde giue him in token of obedience, ſome thing euery yeare, euen ſo much as they themſelues would name, and if they would this doe, the Kyng would giue them rewards and giftes, and helpe againſt theyr enimies, and would put among them learned men &amp; Prieſtes, that ſhould ſhew them that which doth apperteyne to the faith of Chriſte: and if any of them woulde not turne Chriſtians, they ſhould not be compelled by force, agaynſt their willes, but they might remayne as they were before, and they anſwered me to that I ſayde that there was but one God, and this God gouerned the Heauen and the Earth, and was Lorde of

all. It lyked them very well, who ſayde, yt they thought it to be true: and they ſayd, that they were Lords of their owne Coū
                  trey, and had no neede of any other Lorde. Then I required thē agayne yt they ſhould do it, &amp; not doing it, I would make warre agaynſt them, &amp; would take their Towne, &amp; would kill as many as I tooke, or would keepe thē priſoners, and ſell thē for ſlaues. They aunſwered me, that firſt they would put my head vpō a ſtaffe, &amp; they laboured to do it, but they coulde not, for we tooke the towne by force, although they ſhotte at vs an infinite nūber of arrowes, &amp; al poyſoned wt hearbes, wherwith they wounded two of our men, and both dyed, although their wounds were but ſmall. After I tooke priſoner an Indian Gentleman, of thoſe w
                     •
                  ich I ſpake of before, that had declared to me of the mines of Vocri, whome I founde to be a man of much truth, &amp; kept his promiſe in al things. And after this ſort are all the warres of thoſe Countreys. Frō this riuer of Cenu, vnto the Gulfe of Vraba, are. xxv leagues. The gulfe of Vraba lieth towards the Weaſt in .viij. degrees. Al this Countrey is full of Mountaynes, &amp; a naughtye kinde of people: they are all Canibals, &amp; eate mans fleſh. They vſe to ſhoote with bowes and arrowes which are poyſoned. Fiue leagues from the Riuer of Canibals. 
                  Cenu towards the Weſt, is an Iland called the ſtrōng Iland, welnecre a league frō the lande. In this Iland is muche ſalte made, and neerer the Gulfe is another, called the Tortuga. The Gulfe of Vraba hath. xiiij leagues of length within the land, &amp; The Gulfe of Vraba of breadth in the mouth an entrie .vj. or .vij. leagues, farther in fiue, and neere the cape foure. At the entrie toward the Eaſt he hathe certaine ſholdes, which entreth in more thā two leagues into the Sea athwart of the mouth &amp; entrie, and they goe welneere ouer the one halfe of the entrie towards the Weaſt part of the Gulfe. And there is fiue leagues within the Gulfe, the Darien, whych is inhabited with Chriſtiās, and there they gather fyne golde in a Riuer that deſcendeth from certaine high Mountaynes. In theſe Mountaynes be many Tigres &amp; Lyons, and diuers other beaſtes, and Cattes with lōg tayles, and

be like to Apes, but that they haue great tayles. There are alſo Swyne, &amp; many great beaſtes as great as kyne, fatte, whiche be of a grey couloure, and haue their feete like to kyne, the head like to a Moyle, with long eares, their fleſh being good to eate. There be alſo many other beaſtes. I toke that Towne, which was the firſt that was taken in that Countrey, and I ſaw all theſe beaſts, and it was told me, that they had ſene Ownees. I ſaw none, but I ſaw a riuer yt paſſeth by the towne of Darien, wherein were many Lyzards that were great, &amp; ſo groſe in the body as a Calfe: and if they ſee any man, dogge, or pigge neere the water, they come out of it, and fall vpon him, and if they catche him, they carrie him into the water, &amp; eate him. I happened to kill ye firſt that was killed, &amp; I ſaw caſt at hym more than tenne Launces, and as they ſtrake vpō him, they rebounded, as though they had ſtricken vpō a Rocke. And after that, a ſeruant of mine went athwart of hym, and thruſt him at one blowe into the middeſt of his body, and then we killed hym, and being dead and taken on lande, we found that he had vpon his backe from his necke to the tayle a ſhell that couered hym all, whiche was ſo ſtrong, that no Launce coulde paſſe it: and vnder that from the middle of the body downewarde neere to the guttes, he was as other Lyzards are, and by that parte of his body he was thruſt in with the Launce. His mouth was three ſpannes long from the ſnoute to the lower end of ye teeth: he had in a ſide two rewes of teeth, the moſt fierce that I haue ſeene, or had bin ſeene by any of them that were with me. He was fleyne &amp; his fleſh was eatē, it was white &amp; good, &amp; ſmelled like to muſke, and good in eating. I ſaw alſo ye fleſh of Tigres &amp; of Lions. I ſaw certayne mē kil Lyons alone by thēſelues. Lyons. The Tygres are greater of bodye than the Lyons are, and Tygres. their feete are verye ſtrong, and of greate force, but they are heauie, for they runne ſlowly &amp; are of little courage. It hapned yt a Tygre wēt after a mā a league, vntil he came to a towne, &amp; the mā neuer wēt but his accuſtomed pace, &amp; the Tygre after him .iij. or .iiij. ſpeares lēgth bebind, &amp; in a league yt they wēt

togither, he durſt not to faſten with the man. The Lizardes in Lizards. the moneth of Ianuary and February do breede in this order fellowyng When the Sunne is hoteſt in the day, they come for the of the water into the ſandes, and with their foure feete they make a hole, and there lay theyr egges, and after they bee layd, they couer them with the ſand, and with the heate of the Sunne. The Lizardes be ingendred in thoſe egges, and after they make a hole in them, and they come forth of the egges into the ſandes, and ſo they goe into the water. The egges be as greate as a Gooſe egge, and greater. They haue no ſhelles, but certayne ſkynnes. They be good to eate, and of a good ſauoure, &amp; euery Lizard doth lay at one tyme lx. or lxx. egges. Lykewiſe there be others called Yaguanas, whiche be great, and lyke Yaguanas. to Lizards, and theſe haue round heads, and from the forepart of the head to the tayle, he caryeth bruſtels of heare, ſtandyng vp very fierce. They be of a ruſſet coloure, and ſomewhat in coloures: theſe goe into the Mountaines. The ſight of them is fearefull, but they hurt no body, by reaſon they take them aliue, and kill them with ſtaues. Theſe are good meate, &amp; theyr fleſhe is muche eſteemed in that countrey. Their egges be of a good taſt. In theſe Countreys is muche wilde foule of dyuers ſorts, which are good fleſh. There are abūdance of greene Popingeys, and ſome greate ones of many coloures, red, blewe, blacke, and greene, whiche are faire to beholde. Their fleſhe is good and ſweete: and others that are as little as grey Sparrowes, which be greene and faire. In this countrey are greate fiſhings of good fiſh: and alſo there be Date trees that do carry frute as greate as a Doues egge, ſome yellow, and other of the Roſe coloure, but they haue greate ſtones: their taſt is ſomewhat ſharp. In this Countrey are little beaſtes like to Pigges of a month olde, theſe haue their feete and heads lyke to a little Horſe, with little eares, and they be all couered with a ſhell from the eares to the tayle, and be like to a Horſe couered. They are faire to behold. They feede like to Horſe. In this countrey are Conies and Partriches, and many goodly birds.

And the bread and Wine of this Countrey is made of Maiz, (as it is ſaide:) The people are tall of growth, and Idolaters. There are ſome of them that beleeue, that there is no other thing, but to be borne▪ and to die. There be amōg them Lords, whome they honoure much. And he that is a great Lord, they call Tiba, and others that be not ſo great, Quin

                     s. Before thys Riuer of Darien, entreth in another Riuer very greate in thys gulfe of Vraba, and he entreth in by ſixe or ſeauen monthes, A greate Riuer. although they be but ſholde, and no ſhippe can enter in at thē, if they be greater than ſmall boates: but within the mouth he is greate, and fifteene and twenty fadome deepe, and a myle broade, &amp; hath abundance of water, by reaſon that xl. leagues within the land there ioyneth with him greate riuers, whiche commeth from the Eaſt parte of the Mountaynes, where the Riuer of Cenu ſpringeth: and the firſt riuer that ioyneth wyth him, is that of Dabayne. In the ſprings of this Riuer, and of another whiche is before this, they ſaye that there are greate mines, but the truth is not knowen, but the Indians doe ſay it. And there hathe bin takē in the power of Indiās, peeces of fine golde, that wayed ſeauen and eyght hundred waight. In the little riuers of this great riuer, are many places drowned vp, and in them are many Indians, and haue their houſes and habitations vpon trees, for that vnder them is al water, and they liue by fiſhing. This gulfe of Vraba hath on the other parte of the Mountaine of Darien towards the South, another gulfe, called the gulfe of Saint Michaell, and there is frō the one to ye other xxv. leagues &amp; more. There is this differēce betwene thē: The Gulfe of S. Michaell. in the gulfe of Darien and Vraba, the Sea dothe not flowe one palme, and in that of Saint Michaell, it floweth as much as in Britaine. And of this coaſt of the gulfe of Saint Michaell I wil ſpeake hereafter. And now I do returne to the gulfe Vraba, and do ſaye, that from the entrye in of the gulfe of Vraba, vnto the port De Careta, are fifteene leagues. Careta lieth Northweaſt, Careta. Nombre de Dios. in nine decrees and halfe. From the Port Perdido, to Nombre de Dios, the coaſt lyeth Weſt North Weſt. Nombre de Dios
                  
ſtandeth in tenne degrees and halfe, and there are in the middeſt Conegie, Pocuroſa, and the baye of Saint Blaſe. There are from the port Perdido to Conogie ſeauen leagues. From Conogie to Pocuroſa tenne. From Pocuroſa to the baye of Saint Blaſe, fyue. From the baye to Nombre de Dios ſixe. In all this countrey Pocuroſa. they call men Omes, and the women Iras. The men goe naked, and they vſe to bring tyed at their middle with a ſmall cord certayne Snayles ſhelles of the Sea, and into theſe ſhels they put their members, and ſome doe carrie a thing like to a fonnell of golde, wherein they put their members. The Women goe all couered from the waſt downewarde with waſt coates of cotten woll, and weare rings put through their eares, and many other things, and cheynes of gold. There hathe bin found amongſt the Indians much golde, although that muche of it is courſe, and in valewe of tenne and twelue kuyllats and leſſe, and they call this Giamin. In ye South part of this countrey is found golde in the Riuers, and as it hath not bin much ſought till now, it hath not bin knowen. I haue ſeene a graine gathered in a Riuer, whiche wayed ſeauen Ducates. From Nombre de Dios to Veragua, are fiue and thirtie leagues. Veragua is Veragua. towardes the Weaſt in tenne degrees. And neere to Nombre de Dios is Port Bello, which is a good Port. It hathe at the entrie of it a little Ilande, and in the middeſt another. The Countrey of this coaſt is full of ſharpe Mountaynes, and barren. From Veragua the coaſt turneth North to the cape of Gracias Adios, threeſcore leagues. The cape of Gracias 
                  The cape of Gracias Adios. 
                  Adios ſtandeth in foureteene degrees. And neere to Veragua is the Furmia, and after Corobora, and after that certayne Ilandes, compaſſed aboute with ſholdes: and from the cape of Gracias Adios the coaſt turneth Weaſt▪ to the cape of Caxines, where is an Ilande, and is thirtie leagues diſtante. And from the cape of Caxines the coaſt turneth towards the North threeſcore and fifteene leagues, vnto the cape de Lagar, and all theſe threeſcore and fifteene leagues be ſholdes, and entreth into Sholde

this cape to the cape of the Iland of Cuba, are one hundred and twenty leagues. The cape of Cuba lieth North. From the cape of Lagar, vnto the cape of Fondura, are fiue and thirtie leagues. The coaſt lieth Weſt. The cape of Lagar, and that of The cape Lagar. 
                  Fondura, ſtandeth in .xvj. degrees, and being paſt the cape of Fondura, is a Gulfe that entreth .xv. leagues within the lande, and in the entrie it hath .xviij. leagues of length, and farther in xxv. From this cape, to the bay of S. Thome, are .lx. leagues, and the coaſt lieth Weaſt. And neere to the bay entreth one end of The bay of S. Thome. the lād into the ſea .xx. leagues towards the Northweaſt, and at the end of the land is the entrie of the baye of S. Thome, and ye bay doth returne vpon the cape Southeaſt .xlv. leagues, and carieth in length and breadth .xv. leagues. And at the entrie in of this gulfe towards the Weaſt, appeareth another little roūd gulfe full of ſmall Ilands. From the mouth of this gulfe, to the Port of the Figueras, are .xxx. leagues. The coaſt lieth Northweaſt, and it is all ſholdes. The entrie of the Gulfe of S. Thome ſtandeth in .xix. degrees and halfe. It entreth in at the Eaſt part, for by the Weaſt part it is all ſholdes. The cape of the Figueras ſtandeth in .xxj. degrees, and from this place the diſcouerers The cape of the Figueras. returned, and paſt no farther: &amp; they found in this Coū
                  trey trees of oke, with acornes like to oures, and many birdes different from thoſe of this Countrey: and hennes as greate as Geeſe: and they found tokens &amp; ſhewes of much golde, for they found great peeces of golde in the power of Indians. And now I do returne to the Gulfe of S Michael, &amp; to the coaſt of ye other The Gulfe▪ of Saint Michaell. ſide towards the South. The Gulfe of S. Michael lieth Northeaſt &amp; Southweaſt, with yt of Vraba, there are .xxv. leagues of land betweene the one and the other. That of S. Michael is towards ye Southweaſt, &amp; it hath at the entrie in .x. leagues, &amp; of length .xxv. And towards the Southweaſt lieth the Ilande of Perles. There is from the Gulfe to the Ilande tenne leagues. An Ilande of Pearles. This Ilād is plentiful of vittaile. There is in it many birds, &amp; ſo many conyes, that they enter into the houſes to breede. And round about it on euery ſide, is much fiſhing of great Pearles,

and very fyne. I ſawe one of the faſhion of a little peare, the beſt and greateſt that I haue ſeene. The entrie of the Gulfe of Saint Michaell, ſtandeth in ſixe degrees. From the entrie of the Gulfe of Saint Michaell, the coaſt lieth Weſt, ſeauen leagues vnto the Cacike Tamao. The coaſt lyeth .xxviij. leagues toward the Northweaſt, and by Weaſt, to the Riuer of Tubanama. 
                  Tamao. This Riuer of Tubanama hath at the entrie an Ilande Tubunama in triangle, whiche cauſeth him to haue two mouthes: it is a good Riuer, and a good Countrey, well inhabited, and of much vittayle, and great fiſhing: there is in it much golde. In this coaſt the Sea doth ebbe and flowe much. From this Riuer to Panama are twenty leagues, and the coaſt lieth Weaſt, and there is in the middeſt the Riuer called Chapanere, and the Panama. Riuer Pacora, whiche are in a good countrey, and where as is Pacora. gold, and the people are good. Panama hath an Iland towards the Sea neere ye land. Frō 
                  Panama to the cape of Chiru are .xx. leagues, and the coaſt lyeth Weaſt and by South, &amp; there is Chiru. in ye middeſt Perequete and Tabora. From Chiru towards the Weſt appeareth a gulfe oblique, in the middeſt whereof dwelleth the Cacike Paris, an Indian Gentleman of greate power, and the richeſt in that coaſt: and there remayneth in the myddeſt Paris. 
                  Nathan and Eſtora, which are good townes. All this coaſt frō the Gulfe of Saint Michaell to Chiru and Paris, be from ſixe to ſeauen degrees. The countrey is playne and good, and of much vittayle of all ſortes, and in all that countrey is muche golde. From Paris lyeth a poynt of the land into the Sea twē
                  tie leagues, and being paſt the poynt, the coaſt turneth to the Northeaſt, vntill it come hard to the cape of Gracias a Dios, and all the Countrey is frutefull, and a rich Countrey of gold, whereas are many good townes. In this Countrey they doe compaſſe about the townes with timber, for feare of Tygres, and Lions, that they come not by night into the houſes. From the Gulfe of Vraba &amp; Saint Michaell, to the end of the cape of Gracias Adies, are two hundred leagues: and all this Countrey hathe not in breadth more than thirtie, and where it is

moſt fourtie leagues, and all are good people and riche, and a fruyteful coūtrey. There they vſe no bowes, nor hearbe of poyſon, but Launces and Dartes. And there are in this Sea towardes the Southe many Ilandes, where is as muche golde and Pearles, as the Indians doe ſay. And they ſay that there is a countrey where the people that doe inhabite it, haue bookes, and do wryte and reade as we doe.
               Now ſeyng that we haue ſpoken of that part that is from the Ilande of Fierro, towardes the Weaſt, and Northweaſt, lette vs ſpeake of one peece of lande whiche is in this ſeconde parte towardes the North, whiche lande is called the lande of Labrador. This lande of Labrador ſtandeth in .lvij. degrees: it ſtandeth Northweaſt from Calizia, and Eaſt and Weaſt with Scotlande. This lande of Labrador hath towardes the Weaſt parte of it the countrey of Bacallaos, whiche is a countrie of muche fiſhyng, and a great countrey: and the Bocallaos ſtandeth Weaſt from Galizia, and parte of them Weaſt and by Northe, and this countrey hath many portes, and good: Muche of the countrey is inhabited, and there are many Ilandes before it, all inhabited. They ſay there is in it greate quantitie of Furres, and very fine. The lande of Labrador is towards the North from the Acores. There is from the Acores to the lande of Labrador three hundreth leagues, and from Galizia to the lande Labrador three hundreth and fiftie. And there is from Galizia to the lande of Cauallaos fiue hundreth and thirtie leagues. The lande of Cauallaos ſtandeth in fourtie nine, and in fiftie degrees.
