            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

nyce louing and bidding she was content for her supper and what else
hee would of curtesie bestow vpon her, for she held it scorne she sayd,

Hacksters, whom she had prouided vpon purpose, came to the doore

did question with her what he was, &amp; where he was? Truly sir, sayes

she, they came to my house, and sayd they were man and wife; and for
my part I knew them for no other, and hee being afraid, is indeed (to
confesse the troth) shut vp in the Closet.  Cardes well packt, are as halfe the game won. No doubt (if it please your

Alas I haue none, sayes he, but this Ring on my finger. Why that,
quoth she, or tarry while the Iustice comes: so he gaue it her, tooke

                  In faith sir no, and for proofe,I will tell you wōders of this mad wench &amp; her husband, in my blacke booke, with both their names. I will put you down
with a story of a mad, merry, little dapper, fine wench, who
at Spilsby faire had thrée horse of our own, or another mans
to sell, as she, her husband, and another good fellow, walked
them vp and downe the Faire, the owner came &amp; apprehended
them all, &amp; clapt them in prison, the Iaylor not kéeping
them close prisoners, but letting them lye all a Chamber, by
her wit she instructed them in a formall tale, that she saued all
their liues thus. Being brought the next morrow after their
apprehension, before the Iustices, they examined y• men how
they came by the horses, and they confest they met her with
them, but where she had them, they knew not: then was my
pretty peat brought in, who being a handsome Trull, blusht
as if she had béen full of grace; and being demanded where she
had the horses, made this answere: May it please your worships,
this man my husband, playing the vnthrift, as many
more haue done, was absent from me for a quarter of a year
                        •
                     ,
which grieued me not a litle, insomuch y• desirous to sée him,
&amp; hauing intelligence he would be at Spilsby Faire, I went
thither euen for pure loue of him, on foot, &amp; being within some
ten miles of y• towne, I wa
                        •
                     ed passing weary, &amp; rested me often,
&amp; grew very faint, at last there came riding by me a Seruingman
in a blew coat, with 3 horses tide at one anothers
taile, which he led, as I gest, to sell at the faire: the Seruingman
séeing me so tired, took pitty on me, &amp; asked me if I wold
ride on one of his empty horses, for his own wo
                        •
                     ld not beare
double, I thankt him hartily, &amp; at the next hill got vp, &amp; rode
til we came to a towne within 3 miles of Spilsby, where the
Seruing-man alighted at a house, &amp; 
                        •
                     ad me ride on afore, and
he would presently ouertake me. Wel, forward I rode halfe
a mile, &amp; looking behind me, could sée no body; so being alone,
my heart began to rise, and I to thinke on my husband: a
                        •
                      I
had rid a little further, looking downe a lane, I saw two men
comming lustily vp, as if they were weary; &amp; marking them
earnestly, I saw one of them was my husband, which made
my heart as light as before it was sa
                        •
                     : so staying for them,

after a little vnkinde gréeting betwixt vs (for I chid him for
his vnthriftinesse) he asked me where I had the horse: and I
told him how curteously the Seruingman had vsed me: why
then saies he, stay for him: nay quoth I, lets ride on, and get
you two vpon the empty horses, for he will ouer-take vs ere
we come at the towne, he rides on a stout lusty yong gelding:
so forward we went, and lookt often behind vs, but our Seruingman
came not. At last we comming to Spilsby, alighted
&amp; broke our fast, &amp; tied our horses at the doore, that if hee past
by, séeing them, he might call in; after we had broke our fast,
thinking he had gone some otherway, we went into ye horse-faire,
and there walkt our horses vp &amp; downe to méet with y•
Seruingman; not for the intent to sell them. Now may it
please your worship, whether he had stolne the horses from
this honest man or no, I know not; but alas, simply I
brought them to them to the horse faire, to let him that deliuered
me them, haue them again
                        •
                     : for I hope your worships
do imagine if I had stolne them, as it is suspected, I would
neuer haue brought them into so publike a place to sell: yet i

law be any way dangerous for y• foolish déed, because I know
not the Seruingman, it is I must bide the punishment, and
as guiltlesse as 
                        •
                     ny here: and so making a low curtsie she ended.

                  Alas good Stephen, thou art no Logitian, thou canst
not reason for thy selfe, nor hast no witty argument to draw
me to an exigent: and therefore giue me leaue at large to
reason for this supper, remember the subiect of our disputation,
is the positiue question, whether Whoores to Théeues
are most preiuditiall to the Cōmon-wealth. Alas, you poore

but consuming of goods and begery; and besides, perpetuall
infamy? We bring yong youthes to ruine and vtter
destruction. I pray you Stephen whether had a Marchants
sonne, hauing wealthy parents, better light vpon a whore,
then a Cut-purse, the one onely taking his money, the other
bringing him to vtter confusion. For if the Foyst light vpon
him, or the Conny-catcher, he looseth at the most some hundreth
pounds: but if he fall into the company of a Whoore,
she flatters him, she inueagles him, she bewitcheth him, that
he spareth neither goods nor lands to content her, that is only
in loue with his coine: if hee bee married, hee forsakes his
wife, leaues his children, despiseth his friends, 
                        〈◊〉
                      to satisfie
his lust with the loue of a base Whoore, wh
                        •
                      when hee
hath spent all vpon her, and he brought to beggery, beateth
him out like the Prodigall child
                        •
                     ;The end of keeping a whoores companie. and for a

                     all reward,
brings him, if to the fairest end, to begge: if to the second, to
the gallowes: or at the last and worst, to the por, or as preiuditiall
diseases. I pray you Stephen when any of you come
to your confession at Tyborne, what is your last Sermon
that you make? That you were brought to that wicked and
shamefull end, by following of Harlots: for to that end doe
you steale to maintaine whoores, and to content their badde
humors. Oh Stephen! enter your owne thoughts, and think
what the faire words of a wanton will doe, what the smiles
of a strumpet will driue a man to at, into what ieopardy a
man will thrust himselfe for her that he loues, although for
his swéete villany hee bee brought to a loathsome leprosse.
Tush Stephen, they say the Por came from Naples, some
from Spaine, some from France: but wheresoeuer it first
grew, it is so surely now rooted in England, that by S. Syth
it may better bee called A Morbus Anglicus; then Gallicus,
and I hope you will grant all these French fauours grew
                        •
                     
from Whoores: besides, in my high louing, or rather creeping,
I meane wher
                        •
                     men and women do rob together, there

alwayes the Woman is most bloudy:Women out-strippe men in villany. for shee alwayes vrgeth
vnto death: and though the Men would onely satisfie
themselues with the parties coine, yet she endeth her theft in
bloud, murthering parties so deeply as shee is malicious: I
hope (gentle Stephen) you cannot contradict these reasons,
they be so openly manifestly probable. For mine owne part,
I hope you do not imagine but I haue had some friends besides
poore George my husband: Alas, hee knowes it, and
is content, like an honest simple Suffragan, to bee corriuall
with a number of other good Companions, and I haue made
many a good man, I meane a man that hath a houshold, for
the loue of mee to goe home and beate his poore wife, when
God wotte, I mocke him for the money hee spent, and hee
had nothing for his pence, but the waste beleauings of others
beastly labours.

if Dalilah could betray Sampson, then wonder not if
we (more nice in our wickednesse then a thousand Dalilahs)

their handes in their Pigeon-hoales, crye: Oh fie vpon
Whoores, when Fouler giues them the terrible lash. Examine
Beggars that lye lame by the high-way, and they say,
they came to that misery by Whoores. Some thréed-bare
Citizens, that from Marchants, and other good Trades,
grow to be base Informers and Knights of the Post, crye
out when they dine with Duke Humphrey: O what wickednesse
comes from Whoores. Prentises that runne from

night of my ouer-throw, but that the courteous Cittizens
and Apprentises tooke my part, and so two or thrée of them
were carried to the Counter, although a Gentleman in my

wast away about London, and Tyborne hath eaten vp many
of them, and I will plague them to y• extremity, let them
doe what they dare with their bilbow blades, I feare them

Law, of petty théeues, that rob about the Sub-vrbs. The
limitting law, discoursing the orders of such as follow Iudges
in their circuits, and goe about from faire to faire. The
Iugging law, wherein I will set out the disorders at Nineholes
and Rifling, how they are onely for the benefite of the
Cut-purses. The stripping law, wherein I will lay open the
lewd abuses of sundry Iaylors in England. Beside, you
shall sée there what houses there be about the Sub-vrbs and

Lifts and such like. And lastly, looke for a Bed-roll or Catalogue

to mine owne ouer-throw: for as smoke will hardly
be concealed, so loue will not be long smothered, but wil bewray
her owne secrets, which was manifest in me, who in
my sporting with him, so bewraied my affection, y• he spying
I fauoured him, began to strike when the yron was hotte,
and to take opportunity by the forehead, and one day finding
me in a merrie vaine, beganne to question with me of
loue: which although at the first I slenderly denied him, yet
at last I granted, so that not onely I agréed to plight him
my faith, but that night méeting to haue further talke, I la

                  ciuiously
consented that he cropt the flower of my virginity.
When thus I was spoiled by such a base companion, I
gaue my selfe to content his humor, and to satisfie the swéet
of mine owne wanton desire. Oh here let mee breathe, and
with teares bewaile the beginning of my miseries, and to
exclaime against the folly of my Parents, who by too much
fauouring me in my vanitie in my tender youth, laide the
first plot of my ensuing repentance: Had they with due cor

and themselues lesse sorrowfull. A fathers frowne is
a bridle to the childe, and a mothers checke is a stay to the
stubborne daughter. Oh had my parents in ouer-louing me
not hated me, I had not at this time cause to complaine.
               But leauing this digression, againe to the loosnesse of mine
owne life, who now hauing lost the glory of my youth, and
suffered such a base staue to possesse it, which many men of

                  e, and grew
shamelesse, insomuch he could not desire so much as I did

secretly, &amp; therfore wisht me to prouide for my self, &amp; to
furnish me euery way both with money &amp; apparrell, hoping
as he said, y• after we were departed, and my father saw wee
were married, &amp; that no meanes was to amend it, he would

                  ale with vs as

liberally, as if wee had matcht with his good will. I that
was apt to any ill, agreed to this, and so wrought the matter,
that he carried me away into a strange place, and then
vsing me a while as his wife, when our money beganne to
wax low, hee resolued secretly to go into y• Countrey where
my father dwelt, to heare not onely how my father took my
departure, but what hope we had of his ensuing fauour: although
I was loth to be left in a strange place, yet I was
willing to heare from my friends, who no doubt conceiued
much heart sorrow for my vnhappy fortunes: so that I
parted with a few teares, and enioyned him to make all the
haste he might to returne. He being gone, as the Eagles alwayes
resort where the carrion is, so the brute being spred
abrode of my beauty, and that at such an Inne lay such a
faire young Gentlewoman, there resorted thither many
braue yong Gentlemen, and cutting companions, that tickled
with lust, aimed at the possession of my fauour, and by
sundry meanes sought to haue a sight of me, which I easily
granted to all, as a woman that counted it a glory to bee
wondred at by many mens eyes: insomuch that comming
amongst them, I set their hearts more and more on fire,
that there arose diuers brawles who should bee most in my
company. Being thus haunted by such a troope of lusty rufflers,
I began to find mine owne folly, that had placed my
first affection so loosly, and therefore began as déeply to loath
him that was departed, as earst I liked him when hee was
present, vowing in my selfe, though he had the spoile of my
virginity, yet neuer after should he triumph in the possession
of my fauour: and therefore began I to affection these
new-come guests, and one aboue the rest, who was a braue
yong Gentleman, and no lesse addicted vnto me, then I deuoted
vnto him: for daily hee courted mee with amorous
Sonnets, and curious pend letters, and sent me Iewels,
and all that I might grace him with the name of my seruant:
I returned him as louing lines at last, and so contented
his lusting desire, that secretly and vnknowne to all the

rest, I made him sundry nights my bed-fellow; where I so
bewitcht him with swéet words, that the man began déeply
to dote vpon me, insomuch that selling some portio
                     •
                   of land
that he had, he put it into ready mony, and prouiding Horse
and all things conuenient, carried me secretly away, almost
as farre as the Bathe. This was my second choy
                     •
                  e, and my
second shame: thus I went forward in wickednesse, and
delighted in change, hauing left mine old loue to looke after
some other mate more fit for my purpose: how he tooke my
departure when he returned, I little cared: for now I had
my content, a Gentleman, yong, lusty, and indued with
good qualities, and one that loued mee more tenderly then
himselfe. Thus liued this new entertained friend &amp; I together
vnmarried, yet as man and wife for a while, so louingly
as was to his content and my credit: but as the Tyger,
though for a while she hide her clawes, yet at last shee will
reueale her cruelty: and as the Agnus Castus leafe when it
lookes most dry, is then most full of moisture, so Womens
wantonnes is not qualified by their warines, nor doth their
charinesse for a moneth warrant their castity for euer, which
I proued true: for my supposed husband being euery way
a man of worth, could not so couertly hide himselfe in the
Country, though a stranger, but that he fell in acquaintance
with many braue Gentlemen, whom hee brought home to
his lodging, not onely to honour them with his liberall curtesie,
but also to sée me, being proud if any man of worth applauded
my beauty. Alas poore Gentleman, too much bewitcht
by the wilinesse of a woman▪ had hee déemed my
heart to be a harbour for euery new desire, or mine eye a
suter to euery face, hee would not haue béene so fond as to
haue brought his companions into my company, but rather
would haue mewed me vp as a Hen, to haue kept that
seuerall to himselfe by force, which hee could not retaine by
kindnesse: but the honest minded Nouice little suspected
my change, although I (God wot) placed my delight in nothing
more then y• desire of new choyce, which fell out thus.

Amongst the rest of the Gentlemen that kept him company,
there was one that was his most familiar, and hee reposed
more trust and confidence in him then in all the rest:
this Gentleman began to bee déepely inamored of mee, and
shewed it by many signes, which I easily perceiued; and I,
whose eare was pliant to euery sweet word, and who so allowed
of all that were beautiful, affected him no lesse: so that
loue preuailing aboue friendship, hee brake the matter with
me, and made not many suites in vaine before he had obtained
his purpose: for he had what he wisht, and I had what
contented me. I will not confesse that any of the rest had
some sildome fauours, but this Gentleman was my second
selfe, and I loued him more for the time at the héele, then
the other at the heart: so that though the other youth bare
the charges, and was sir pay for all, yet this new friend was
he that was maister of my affections: which kindnesse betwixt
vs, was so vnwisely cloked, that in short time it was
manifest to all our familiars, which made my supposed husband
to sigh, and others to smile: but he that was hit with
the horne, was pincht at the heart; yet so extreame was the
affection he bare to me, that he had rather conceale his griefe,
then any way make me discontent, so that he smotherd his
sorrow with patience, and brookt the iniurie with silence, til
our loues grew so broad before, that it was a wonder to the
world: whereupon one day at dinner, I being very pleasant
with his chosen friend, and my choyce louer, I know not
how, but either by fortune, or it may bee, some set match,
there was by a Gentleman there present, a question 
                     〈◊〉
                  
in about womens passions, and their mutability in affection,
so that the controuersie was defended, pro &amp; contra,
with arguments, whether a woman might home a second
friend or no, at last it was concluded, that Loue and Lordship
brookes no fellowship, and therefore none so ba
                     •
                  e minded
to beare ariuall. Hereupon arose a questiō about friends
that were put in trust, how it was a high point of treason
for one to betray another, especially in loue, insomuch that

one Gentleman at the boord, protested by a solemne oath,
that if any friend of his, made priuy and fauoured with the
sight of his Mistresse whom hee loued, whether it were his
wife, or no, should secretly séeke to incroach into his roome,
and offer him that dishonor to partake his loue, hee would
not vse any other reuenge, but at the next gréeting stab him
with his poynado, though he were condemned to death for
the action. All this fitted for the humor of my supposed husband,
and strooke both me and my friend into a quandarie:
but I scornfully iested at it, when as my husband, taking
the ball before it came to the ground, began to make a long
discourse what faithlesse friends they were that would faile
in loue, especially where a resolued trust of the party beloued
was committed vnto them: and hereupon, to make the
matter more credulous, and to quip my folly, and to taunt
the basenesse of his friends minde, that so hee might with
courtesie both warne vs of our wantonnesse, and reclaime
vs from ill, he promised to tell a pleasant story, performed as
he said, not long since in Eng

hee courted with many swéet

                   wordes, and faire promises,
charmes that are able to inchaunt almost the chastest eares,
and so subtilly couched his arguments, discouered such loue
in his eyes, and such sorrow in his lookes, that despaire séemed
to sit in his face, and swore, that if she granted not him,
the end of a louers sighes then would present his heart as a
Tragicke sacrifice to the sight of his cruell mistresse. The
Gentlewoman waring pittiful, as women are kind-harted,
and are loth Gentlemen should die for loue, after a few excuses,
let him dub her husband knight of the forked order, and
so to satisfie his humor, made forset of her own honor. Thus
these two louers continued for a great space in such pleasures

                  ith the Gentleman himselfe did giue them frée libertie to
loue, neither suspecting his wife, nor his friend: at last, as
such trayterous abuses will burst forth, it fell out, that a
maid, who had béene an old seruant in the house, beganne to
grow suspitious, that there was too much familiaritie betwéene
her mistre

                  , and her maisters friend; and vpon this,
watcht them diuers times so narrowly, that at last she found
them more priuate then either agréed with her maisters honor,
or her own honesty: and thereupon reuealed it one day
vnto her maister. He, little credulous of the light behauiour
of his wife, blamed the maid, and bid her take héed, lea

spake not of enuy to him, but of meere loue she bare vnto
him, and the rather that hee might shadow such a fault in
time, and by some meanes preuent it, least if others should

                   it as well as she, his wiues good name, and his friends
should be cald in question. At these wise words spoken by so
base a drudge as his maid, the Gentleman waxed astonished
and listned to her discourse, wishing her to discouer how she
knew, or was so priuy to y• folly of her mistresse, or by what
meanes he might haue assured proofe of it, she told him that
to her, her owne eyes were witnesses: for she saw them vnlawfully
together, and please it you sir, quoth shee, to faine
your selfe to goe from home, and then in the backe-house to
kéepe you secret, I will let you sée as much as I haue manifested
vnto you. Upon this the maister agréed, and warned
his maid not so much as to make it knowne to any of her
fellowes. Within a day or two after the Gentleman said he
would go a hunting, and so risse very early; and causing his
men to couple vp his hounds, left his wife a bed, and went abroad:
as soone as hee was gone a mile from the house, hee
commanded his men to ride afore, and to start the Hare, and
follow the chase, and wee will come faire and softly after:
they obeying their maisters charge, went their waies, and
hereturned by a backe way to his house, and went secretly
to the place where his maid and hee had appointed. In the
meane time the mistresse thinking her husband safe with his
hounds, sent for her friend to her bed-chamber, by a trusty
seruant of hers, in whom shee assured that was a secret pander
in such affaires, and the Gentleman was not slacke to
come, but making all the haste he could, came and went into
the chamber, asking for the maister of the house very familiarly:
the old maid noting all this, as soone as shee knew
them together, went and cald her maister, and carried him
vp by a secret paire of staires to her mistresse chamber doore;
where, péeping in at a place that the maid before had made
for the purpose, he saw more then he lookt for, and so much
as pincht him at the very heart, causing him to accuse his
wife for a strumpet, and his friend for a traytor: yet for all
this, valuing his owne honor more then their dishonesty,
thinking if he should make an vprore, hee should but aime

at his owne discredit, and cause himselfe to be a laughing
game to his enemies, he concealed his sorrow with silence,

neuer to reueale it so long as she liued: vpon this they parted,

with teares in his eyes, and his heart ready to burst with
sighes, he was silent, when his wife stricken with remorse
of conscience, leaping out of her bed i

                   her smocke, humbly
confessing all, craued pardon, promising if he should pardon
this offence which was new begun in her, she wold become
a new reformed woman, &amp; neuer after so much as in thought
giue him any occcasion of suspition or iealously: the patient
husband not willing to vrge his wife, took her at her word, &amp;
told her y• when he found her so reclaimed, he would as afore
he had done, vse her louingly &amp; as his wife, but till he was so

perswaded of her honesty, he would pay her still slips for his
pleasure, charging her not to reueale any thing to his friend
or to make it knowne to him that hee was priuy to their
loues. Thus the debate ended, I gesse in some kinde gréeting,
and the Gentleman went abrode to sée his pastures,
leauing his wife in bed full of sorrow, and almost re
                     •
                  ting
her heart asunder with sighes. As soone as hee was walked
abrode, the Gentleman his friend came to the house, and asked
for the good man: the pander that was priuy to all their
practises, said that his maister was gone abrode to sée his
pastures, but his mistresse was in bed: why then sayes he, I
will go and raise her vp; so comming into the chamber, and
kissing her, meaning as hee was wont to haue vsed her accustomed

                     •
                  alliance, she desired him to abstaine with broken
sighes, and her eyes full of teares: he wondring what should
make her thus discontent, asked her what was the cause of
her sorrow, protesting with a solemne oath, that if any had
done her iniury, he would reuenge it, were it with hazard of
his life: shee then told him, scarce beeing able to speake for
wéeping, that shee had a sute to moue him in, which if hee
granted vnto her, she would hold him in loue and affection
without change, next her husband for euer: hee promised to
doe whatsoeuer it were: then saies she, sweare vpon a Bible
you wil do it without exception: with that he to

                  ke a Bible
that lay in the window, and swore, that whatsoeuer shee requested
him to doe, were it to the losse of his life, he would,
without exception performe it. Then shee holding downe
her head and blushing, began thus: I néede not quoth shee,
make manifest how grosly and grieuously you and I haue
both offended God, and wronged the honest gentleman my
husband, and your friend; hee putting a speciall trust in vs
both, and assuring such earnest affiance in your vnfained

                  sed in you, haue you returned with treachery &amp; falshood,

in abusing mine honesty &amp; his honor. Now a remorse of cō
                  science
toucheth me for my sins, that I heartily repent, and
vow euer hereafter to liue only to my husband: &amp; therefore
my sute is to you, that from henceforth you shall neuer so
much as motion any dishonest question vnto me, nor seeke
any vnlawfull pleasure or conuersing at my hands: this is
my sute, &amp; hereunto I haue sworne you, which oath if you
obserue as a faithfull gentleman, I will conceale from my
husband what is past, and rest in honest sort your faithfull
friend for euer, at this she burst a fresh into teares, &amp; vttered
such sighes, that he thought for very griefe her heart would
haue claue asunder. The gentleman astonied at this strange
Metamorphosis of his mistresse, sate a good while in a maze,
and at last taking her by the hand, made this reply: So God
helpe mee faire swéeting, I am glad of this motion, &amp; wondrous
ioyfull that God hath put such honest thoughts into
your minde, &amp; hath made you the meanes to reclaime 
                     〈◊〉
                  
from my folly: I féele no lesse remorse then you do in wronging
so honest a friend as your husband, but this y• frailnesse
of man, &amp; therfore to make amendes, I protest anew, neuer
hereafter so much as in thought, to motion you of dishonesty,
only I craue you be silent: she promised that, and so they
ended, and for that time they parted. At noone the Gentleman
came home, &amp; chéerfully saluted his wife, &amp; asked if dinner
were ready, &amp; sent for his friend, vsing him wonderfully
familiarly, giuing him no occasion of mistrust, &amp; so pleasantly
they past away the day together: At night when his wife
and he went to bed, she told him all, what had past betweene
her &amp; his friend, &amp; how she had bound him with an oath, and
that he voluntarily of himselfe swore as much, being heartily
sorry that he had so déeply offended so kinde a friend. The
Gentleman commended her wit, &amp; found her afterward a
reclaimed woman, she liuing so honestly that she neuer gaue
him any occasion of mistrust. Thus the wise Gentleman
reclaimed with silence a wanton wife, and retained an assured
friend.
               
                  
At this pleasant tale all the

in change; but the gentlemant y• was his familiar, &amp; my Paramour,

dishonestly, but reclaimed hinselfe, abstained from me, &amp; became

one day in the chamber alone, &amp; he in his dumps, I began to
dally with him, &amp; to aske him why he was so strange, &amp; vsed
not his accustomed fauours to me: hee solemnly made
answere, that though he had plaid the foole in setting his fancy vpon anothers mans wife, &amp; in wronging his friend, yet his conscience was now touched with remorse, &amp; euer since he heard the tale afore rehearsed, he had vowd in himself neuer to do my husband the like wrong againe.

I now being brought to London, and left here at randon,
was not such a house-doue while any friend staied with me,
but that I had visite some houses in London, that could harbour
as honest a woman as my selfe; when as therefore I
was left to my selfe, I remoued my lodging, &amp; gat me into
one of those houses of good hospitality whereunto persons
resort, commonly called a Trugging-house, or, to be plaine, a
Whore-house, where I gaue my selfe to entertaine all companions,
sitting or standing at the dore like a staule, to allure
or draw in wanton passengers, refusing none y• would
with his purse purchase me to be his, to satisfie the disordinate
desire of his filthy lust: now I began not to respect personage,
good qualities, to the gracious fauour of the man,
when eie had no respect of person, for y• oldest lecher was as
welcom as y• yongest louer, so he broght meat in his mouth.
Thus to the griefe of my friends, hazard of my soule, &amp; consuming
of my body, I spent a yeare or two, in this base and
bad kind of life, subiect to y• whistle of euery desperate Ruffian,
till on a time, there resorted to our house a Cloathier, a
proper yong man, who by fortune comming first to drinke,
espying me asked me if I would drink with him, there needed
no great entreaty, for as then I wanted company, &amp; so
clapt me downe by him, &amp; began very pleasantly to welcom
him, y• man being of himselfe modest and honest, noted my
personage, &amp; iudicially reasoned of my strumpet-like behauiour,
and inwardly, as after hee reported vnto me, grieued
that so foule properties were hidden in so good a proportion,
and y• such rare wit &amp; excellent beauty was blemisht wt
whoredomes base deformity, in so much y• he began to thin
                     •
