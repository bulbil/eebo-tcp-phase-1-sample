            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  LIKE A STORME-beaten-ship,
with many vnfortunate
conflicts (in my long-ſome
journeyes) here and there haue I
ſtill beene toſſed, till now at last
I haue arriued to the ſafe harborie of your Lordships
favour: being ſore fatigated in my troubleſome
trauailes, I am very eagerly willing to
be comforted with the rare fruites of your Honours
admired Engine, who with a most generous
ſpirit, can temper thy greatnes with benignitie,
thy Majeſtie with meekeneſſe, thy Heroyick
minde with courteſie, thy Noble hand with
liberalitie, and thy Herculian-heart with clemencie,
ſuch is the inestimable ritches (of thy renowned

worth) which hath made (and ſtill
makes) conquest of many hearts. O what can I
ſay of my ſelfe (who without any merit in mee)
hath ſo often felt the force of your Lordſhips
loue, I am ſorie that I shall neuer be able
to value the ritch treaſure of ſuch great deſert:
Good will is all my wealth, and yet my
ſeruice (bound by dutie) craues no thanks. Than
most worthie (to be named worthy) Lord, receaue
theſe my Labours as the true tributarie
effects of my affection, the beholding of this
Humorous world, the ſtrange alterations of
Time, and the inconstant wauering of my euerchanging
Fortune, will afforde mee no other
Subject, it may truly be ſaide, Fortuna vitrea
eſt, quae cum ſplendet frangitur. My
peregrinations enlarged my curioſitie, my ſouldiers
eſtate promiſed to preferre mee, and the
ſmiles of Court ſtuffed my braines with manie
idle ſuppoſitions. Heere abruptly muſt I needes
breake off, fearing least the great occaſion of
this diſcourſe, make mee forget my ſelfe, and become
tedious in reckoning vp my loſſe of Time.
So in my neuer-ending-loue, I end, wishing your
Lordſhips valour, good fortune, your eſtate
               
all happineſſe, and that your Honours diſcretion
may ſepulchriſe this boldneſſe of

                  IN A FEARELES HV
               mor,
I haue anatomized the humors
of mankinde, to the mouth of the honeſt
man, it hath a moſt delicate and ſweet
taſte, but to the wicked, it is bitter as
gall or wormwood, for if thou be a diſſembling hypocrite,
one of the ſect of fleſhly and bloudie Goſpellers,Math. 7. Chap. one of the
generation of Wolues cloathed in ſheepe-skins, which are
naught elſe, but hatchers of deceit, to entrap ſoules, inventers
of treaſon to murther Kings, helliſh inſtruments
to ruine Countries, ſworne enemies to God, and diligent
factors for the deuill. If thou be a man of this Categorie,
I hate thee to the very death: but if thou firſt be true to
God, and next to thy owne Prince: if thou be faithfull to
thy Country, if thou judge all men with equitie in ſpite of
loue or briberie, if thou wrong no man: and laſt of all, if
thou be all in all a good Christian, thou art an honeſt man,
&amp; thou art the man whō I place in my harts hart: if thou
be a woman of a modeſt behauiour, &amp; diſcreet in all thy
actions, of a chaſt mind, and of a good life, who ſtill aymes
at honeſtie, and proſecutes all thy deſires with the feare of
God: it is thou who is the honeſt woman, and thou art the
woman whom I honour to the death. Then be what thou
wilt who reades this Treatiſe, be ſure to finde thy ſelfe ſet

downe in a true faſhion, I haue taken the paines to paint
thy portrate, if thou finde thy ſelfe in faire colours, then
be carefull how to entertaine thy ſelfe in the true Luister,
if thou finde thy ſelfe in filthie colours, waſh, clainge, and
purge thy ſelfe from ſuch pestiferous blots, which euen infects
thy very ſoule, and makes thee leath ſome to the ſight
of God. I haue ſearched thy feaſtred wounds, I haue bared
thy vlcered ſores, and for feare of putrifying cankers
I haue tainted thee to the very quick: ſo to keepe thy weaknes
in a good temper, I haue applied this Cataplaſme, to
appeaſe thee of all thy paines: I am ſurely perſwaded, that
theſe my labors ſhal merit thanks of the vpright man who
loues God, obedient to his King, and is true to his Country,
and that the good report of the righteous ſhall guard
me, from criticall barking of wicked malice, and I am
aſſured, that the honeſt Matron, the wife true to her huſband,
and the chaste virgin will euer party me, and euer
be ready to countercheck the detracking reports of the
ſhameleſſe woman, whilſt my reuenge ſhall be with ſilence,
and ſimple patience to ſmile at neuer-bluſhing-impudence.
To conclude, I onely expect to be quarrelled with
the deceitfull villaine, whom I will proue to be an arrant
Knaue: if thou challenge me, I ſcorne to be a Coward, and
therefore I will anſwer thee. So I ſhall euer reſt thy hatefull
Enemie, and the honeſt mans Seruant to the death.

            And of her Labours makes a ſacrifees,
            Then ouer-ſpread them with thy glorious eyes,
            Let luſter faire inritch my rurall rime,
            Thou haſt the power (great Potent) if thou plees,
            To regiſter my verſe in endleſſe time,
            If quicknes of thy wit finde any crime,
            In thy diſcretion ſepulchrize my wrong,
            For why thou know'ſt my Muſe in youthfull prime
            Did what ſhe could to pleaſe thee in her ſong:
            Great is the glory of my wiſh'd-for-gaines,
            If deereſt Dame, thou patronize my paines.

firſt eateth it ſelfe out of a very
little ſeed, and then groweth to
be a quick creature: a while after,
it is fed and nouriſhed vpon
freſh and greene leaues, then
it comes to a greater quantitie,
and againe, it eates it ſelfe out of that coat, and worketh
it ſelfe in a coate of ſilke ingendred full of ſmall
ſeede for many young-ones to breed of, in the end
it leaues the ſlugh of ſilk for the Ornament of mankinde:
And laſt of all, it dieth in the ſhape of a white
winged flye. A King may be compared to the ſilke
worme, which firſt of the earth becommeth a creature,
and then being fed &amp; nouriſhed vpon the grace,
favour, and mercie of God, with the loue, feare, and
obedience of his ſubjects; he becommeth a King of
more kingdomes, and ſo from kingdome to kingdome
he groweth to be an imperiall and free Monarch over
many Countries, for him and his poſteritie to poſſeſſe
for ever: in the end, he leaues his vertues education,
his good qualities, his vpright juſtice, his mercie,
his compaſſion on the poore, and his loue to all his

people, to be a mirrour to the reſt of earthly Kings,
one example to his children, and a never decaying
Ornament to all his Off-ſpring: then laſt of all, he
returneth againe to the earth; and his ſoule cloathed
with pure innocent whitenes, flyeth vp to heaven in
the beautifull ſhape of a bright, winged Angell, Who
ſhall aſcend (ſayes the Prophet) into the mountaine of the
Lord, and who ſhall ſtand in his holy place? euen he that
hath inuocent hands, and a pure heart, who hath not in
the rage of crueltie ſucked the bloud of innocents,
who hath not ſuffered the greater powers to oppreſſe
his poore Subjects: it is he who extols Iuſtice, and
triumphs in mercie.21. Pſal. 
               O God, this man is he whoſe glorie
is great in thy ſalvation, both dignitie and honour haſt
thou laid vpon him: It is thou, O Lord, who governes
all his actions, and ſtill inſtructs his minde what he
ſhall doe: Cor regis in manu domini quocunque voluerit
inclinabit illud:
               Pro. 21. Cap. Then thou ô earthly King, behold how
the great and mightie King of all Kings is thy ſure bulwarke,
his ſtrength guards thee againſt the malitious
mindes of men, the poyſonnous Calumnie of
wicked vipers ſhall not offend thee, nor the ſubtill
hatchers of vnnaturall Treaſon, ſhall neuer prevaile
againſt thee, becauſe God aſſures thee of thy life in
all thy journeyes by day or by night, he ſtill ſayes vnto
thee as he ſaid by the voyce of his Angell to Gideon:
Peace be vnto thee,
               Iudg. 6. Cap. 
               feare not thou ſhalt not die: How bold
may thou be to build vpon this aſſurance: if God be
with thee,Pro. 20 Cap. who can be againſt thee Thy anger is like the
roaring of a Lyon, he that prouoketh thee to wrath, ſinneth
against his owne ſoule. Who ſhould not tremble at thy
furie, &amp; who ſhould not be afraid to offend thee? who

dare calumniate a King, or yet ſpeake againſt the vprightneſſe
of his juſtice; God him ſelfe giues this
ſtraite commaund,Exo. 22. Cap. ſaying, Thou ſhalt not raile vpon
the Iudges, neither ſpeake euill of the ruler of the people.
Then the Apoſtle Saint Paul tells thee why thou
ſhould not doe it:Rom. 13. cap. 
               Becauſe he is the Minister of God
to take vengeance on them that doe euill. I ſay to thee,
O King:
            
               Thou earthly God, whoſe ouer-ruling hand
               The Scepter ſwayes, and doth vnſheath the ſword.
               Now ſeruile Kingdomes ſtoupes at thy command?
               Who dare controle thy vnrecalled word.
               Thou with great glorie of thy triple crowne,
               Erecks the good, and throwes the wicked downe.
            
            God hath anoynted thee a King, and placed thee here
on earth to be a God, and to doe right to all men,
without reſpect of perſons. God him ſelfe calls you
a God, and commaunds you, ſaying: Doe right to the
poore and fatherleſſe: doe juſtice to the poore and needie, becauſe
I haue ſaid thou art a God: And therefore be ſure
that the great God of heaven, will judge you that are
Gods on earth: remember how he is to craue a moſt
ſharpe reckoning at your hands, therefore how carefull
ſhould thou be ever to diſcharge thy great and
waightie charge which hangs over thy head: thou art
a ruler of many, and many things will be asked of thee;
reſpect alwayes the poore more then the ritch, and let
not the complaints of thy people come to thy eares by
the mouthes of thy briberous Minions; call the poore
complainer before thee, ſtay and heare them with
patience, and wearie not to examine their wrongs,
when thy pitty hath pondred their eſtate: Pronounce

ſentence with thy owne tongue, then let thy diligent
eye ſee judgement executed, and delay not the poore
mans cauſe, nor let no ſeniſtrus requeſt recall thy juſt
reſolution. And ſo ſhall the teares of the diſtreſſed
creatures imbalme thy ſoule, thy righteouſnes ſhall
crowne thee, and thy mercie ſhall ſet thee on the majeſticall
Throne of Gods eternall glory! O remember
what thou art, where thou art, and what thou ſhalt
be, as I haue ſaid: thou art a King anoynted by God
over many people: thou art here on earth a Judge;
and thou art to be called before the tribunall ſeate of
God, to giue a reckoning of thy behaviour! O then
how narrowly ſhould thou looke to thy journey, how
perrilous is thy Prograce? what weightie burthen
hangs on thy ſhoulders, what continuall faſhires,
what incomprehenſible care, and what great memorie
craues thy carefull eſtate? With eyes of wiſedome
governe thy ſight about thy ſelfe, and if thou chance
to ſee ſheltred vnder thy owne wings, the deceitfull
paraſite, the male-contented Mutenar, the murmuring
whiſperer, the detracker of honeſtie, the invier
of vertue, the ambitious oppreſſour, or the vnmercifull
briber: then if thou finde ſuch caterpillars about
thee, ſweepe them away; becauſe they are conſuming
cankers to thy ſtate, bloud-ſuckers of innocents, veſſels
of treaſon, and ſworne enemies to the true Vnion
of thy Kingdomes. O ſayes the great King of wiſedome,Pro. 25. cap.
               Take away the wicked men from the King, and his
throne ſhall be ſtabliſhed in righteouſnes. Shake off all
kinde of ſuch infectious ſcabs, and purge thy companie
of ſuch peſtiferous euils; keepe ever with the men
of truth, and place ſuch men in office as feares God,

and loues thee. Let graue and honourable counſailours
conduct thee, and guard thy ſelfe with them.
Commaund thou them as God hath commaunded all
you that are Kings,Deutro. 1. cap. Say ye ſhall haue no reſpect of perſons
in judgement, but ſhall heare the ſmall as well as the great:
ye ſhall not feare the face of man, for the judgement is Gods:
Thou art the Lieutenant of God, therfore thou ſhould
looke well to thy officers, and how they are enclined.
A true and faithfull ſubject, who doth the will of his
King, is worth the halfe of his Kings kingdom. O ſayes
Salomon,
               Pro. 14. Cap. 
               the joy and pleaſure of a King is in a wiſe ſervant.
He putteth the charge of him ſelfe in his hands, he is
the pillar of his ſtate, and executes the actions of his
King with a ſincere equitie. It is not birth that makes
thy ſubject noble or honourable. The originall of Nobilitie
is like a ſmall ſpring, which good deſert makes
the gratefull favour of a King to enlarge to a great river,
which by bound dutie ought to pay their dutifull
tribute to the King their Ocaean: but how many are
they that becomes ingrate, and ſwels with pride, ambition,
envie, treaſon, ſedition, and emulation, they
become rebellious flouds, &amp; overflowes their banks,
and in diſperſing them ſelues, looſes their name, and
becomes ignominious to the world. When ſuch men
beholds their owne ruine and ſwift deſtruction (which
blinde pride did never looke for) then how may their
ſhame ſmother ambition in a helpleſſe repentance,
making the eyes of man (which was curious to behold
the glorious triumph of their vpraiſd pomp) turne
with amazement to looke vpon their ſuddaine fall,
this tragicall ſpectacle of the great mans grovelling
on the ground, makes diſpaire crie out, Qui jacet in

terra non habet vnde cadit. O how ſhould that man
haue his minde tortered within his loathſome bodie,
when he beholds how ſwiftly his glorie hath left
him, his honours drowned in diſgrace, his ſalutations
turned to contempt: his bare-headed petitioners
the ſpectators of his ruine, and the voice of the world
(mixtured with loue and diſdaine) making many
miſconſtrued ſuppoſitions, his friends weepes and laments
his eſtate, his foes ſmiles, and makes the accidents
of his deſtruction their diſcourſe, whilſt he poore
rejected ſoule cries out, Colocatus ſum in obſcuris ſicut
mortuus ſeculi. Here is a juſt reward to an vnjuſt ſubject.
True ſervice to God, obedience to thee who is
King, and vpright judgement voyd of partialitie nobilitates
the man, it crownes him with honour, and
makes his glory to ſhine eternally: bleſſed is that
King who may freely giue his ſubject this moſt glorious
and honourable Epithite, ſaying, I haue a faithfull
ſervant: this man is he whom the booke of God calls
the wiſe ſervant, in whom the pleaſure and ioy of a
King remaines: he boldly tells thee thy error, his wiſedome
prevents thy euill, he whiſpers in thy eare, and
deſires thee to read before thou ſet thy hand Litera
ſcriptamanent! O how ſecure may the juſt man be in
his ſoule, his ſafe conſcience makes him feareleſſe: he
hath compaſſion on the poore,Deutr. 16. Cap. he wreſts not the Law,
neither hath he any reſpect of perſons, neither taketh
he rewards to blinde his vnderſtanding, nor yet perverteth
he the words of the juſt man, but ponders the
eſtate of all men with wiſedom: this man may truly be
called a righteous Judge: when Auguſtus Caeſar gaue
aucthority to any Iudge, he alſo gaue this advertiſement,

               I put not (ſayes he) the treaſure of my honour in thy
hands, nor doe I commit my juſtice to thee, that thou ſhould
be a deſtroyer of people, the bloud ſhedder of innocents, nor
ane executioner of malefactors, but with the one hand thou
ſhould maintaine the good, and with the other hand raiſe vp
the euill man from his wickednes. Therefore I ſend thee
forth to be a preceptor and defender of Orphanes, a helper
of widowes, a Chirurgion for all wounds, a ſtaffe for the
blinde, a pittier of the poore, and a father to all perſons. To
ſpeake faire to my enemies, and rejoice my friends. O
how much is that man to be eſteemed, who with a
feareleſſe reguard executes the will of his Prince, and
in ſpite of envious malice, giues a true teſtimonie
of a good conſcience: this man is he who is bleſſed
in the ſight of GOD, his ritch treaſure layes
hoarded vp in heaven, the glory of his GOD, the
honour of his King, and the weale of his Countrey
is the onely contemplation of his ſoule in this preſent
time: how perrilous is the eſtate of mankinde:
how is the honeſt mans actions miſdeemed, and his
behaviour miſconſtrued, if he be an actour in the
affaires of his King and Countrey, then is he cenſured
to be a man of partialitie, and a buſie-headed
body, if he retire him ſelfe from Court, and meddle
with nothing, then is he ſuſpected to be a Malevole,
on who expects the change of Court, a ſuborner, or
elſe a faction-maker: then begins Envie to pick quarrels,
Malice will barke and invent falſe information!
O how watchfull ſhould the honeſt minded man be
in this latter dayes of deceit, to ſaue him ſelfe from
the ſubtill ſnares of ſecret envie. This inconſtant
world being ſo full of ſubtill deceites, in whom can

the vpright man truſt, how many in externall complementing
ſhowes vowes affection, where ſecret
grudge is grounded. And beſides, what a quarrellous
pick-thank time is it, when a man dares not truſt him
ſelfe, but doubts his deareſt friend. Some reades ſo
much on Matchavell, that in the end they turne
matchleſſe villaines; the honeſt and plaine dealing
man is abhorred and termed a Gull, whilſt politick
they imployes their wits to exploit other mens deſtruction,
when extreame neceſſitie and miſerie of want
doth vrge the poore men to ſteale or rob; then are
they preſently taken, put in priſon, and laid in chaines
of iron: But when a politick Matchavilian robs the
common wealth, and doth oppreſſe the poore, he triumphs
in golden chaines: it is he who gets the Lawſtouping
ſalutations on the ſtreete: it is he who makes
his deceaving pietie, his cut-throat flatterie, his diſſimulation
to God, to his King and his Countrie, poyſon
the aire. It is he whoſe vnderſtanding could never
reach to that imagination, that there can be a God,
and it is he, who for a ſwift paſſing glory damnes his
ſoule eternally.16. Cap. This ſort of men are they whom our
Saviour Chriſt ſpeakes of in the Evangell of S. Luke,
that they are cloathed in purple, in ſilke, and in fine linings,
well fed, and delicate in all things, in their ſecure
ſenſualitie they contemne the poore Lazarus lying
at their gate, they heare not his ruthfull cries,
they are blinde, and ſees not his ſores, their hearts are
hardned and conſiders not his miſerable eſtate. Theſe
are they who liues in Kings Courts, Qui molibus veſtiuntur
in domibus regum ſunt: In braue apparrell, in
pride of life, and choaked with this worlds vaine glory,

what reckoning ſhall be taken of ſuch men, and
what anſwere can they make to God Almightie,
when he ſhall ſay, Redde rationem vilicationis tuae,
Giue me a reckoning of thy ſtewardſhip;Luk. 13 and
therefore the greater thy place, the greater thy
reckoning ſhall be before God: And the more thy
pleaſures in this life, the more thy paines ſhall be in
the life to come. O what a terrible ſentence giues
Chriſt in the Apocalips when he ſayes, Quantum in
dilitiis ſuit, tantum date illi tormentum. What pleaſures
hath the ritch man had in this world, let him
haue as many torments in the world to come. All
thy ſenſes which did abound in delectation, ſhall
become moſt loathſome, thy delecate eares, ſhall
for their ſweete muſick, receaue moſt deteſtable
howling of tormented ſpirits; thy feeling which
was vſed to fine linnings, and ſoft ſilks, ſhall feele
the burning fire of brimſtone: Thy ſight which
had the proſpect of faire buildings, ritch and curious
Architectors, &amp; pleaſant gardings, ſhall ſee the
ouglie ſight of fearfull and terrible divels; thydian
tie guſt which did ſurfet with all ſorts of ſweetnes,
ſhall be tormented with thirſt and hunger; and thy
ſmell which was fed with rare muſte, &amp; filled with
art of fine oders, ſhall now be perfumed with
ſtink and ſent of moſt intollerable filthines. This
ſhall be the rewarde given to the ritch gluttons of
this world. God ſpeaking by his Prophet Eſay, he
bids, Tollatur impius ne videat gloriam Dei; Take the
wicked man away, that he may not ſee the glory
of God. Then thou who ſucks forth the heartbloud

of the poore, thinke on this, and thou who
art a grievous oppreſſour, looke to thy ſelfe, or rather
thy heart is hardned and can not ſee, thou triumphs
in the aboundance of worldly glorie; thy
conſcience feeles not the forceable ſtroke of ſinne;
thy too much ſenſualitie hath made thy ſoule ſenſles.
But ô when ſicknes the fore-running harbinger
of agonizing death doeth ſeaſe vpon thy bodie, &amp;
wils thee to pay that doubtles debt, no ſuretie will
be taken, nor no ſhifting excuſe can helpe thee,
thy ſoule muſt needs be ſequeſtred from thy bodie,
all thy friends will forſake thee, thy flattering troups
which doeth attend thee, will leaue thee, thy
pleaſures ſhall loath thee, and in thy loathſome
bed ſhalt thou lye deſtitute of all comfort; the divell
in moſt fearefull and terrible forme ſhall
haunt thee, houlding thy haynous ſinnes before
thine eies, and ſtill crying in thine eares, Deſpaire
and dye. What miſerable eſtate ſhall this be,
when thy wicked life layeth this before thee, and
telles, this muſt thou ſuffer, and this way muſt
thou goe. And when the malediction of the oppreſſed
man, the deſtreſſed widow, and fatherles
Children, whoſe ruth-begging-clamours, diſturbes
the Heavens, and brings thee (O wicked
man) to this miſerable end. Can thy ritches
ridde thee, or ſette the free from the horrible paines
of Hell? Where is the glory of thy wealth and ſubſtance
nowe? Divitiarum jactantia quid vobis contulit?
And beſides all this, how infamous ſhall thy
name be amongſt the Commons ſtill, like a Tennice

ball, toſſed from mouth to mouth, Saying,
the moſt pernitious inſtrument of our age hath left
this worlde; The onely Glutton of Ambition
whoſe inſatiable deſires coulde never be filde,
one who ſubornde the eare of his Prince, and
made him beleeue that everie ſtrange face was
comde to cut his throat, on whoſe envy wold ſuffer
no man riſe but himſelfe. When ever he did marke
any aſpyring branch, flouriſh vnder the ſhining favour
of the King, then did his ſeditious wittes, and
his Luciferian pryde, ſearch by all meanes how to
deſtroy him. This ever byting hound whoſe teeth
was a contagious canker, when his heart was moſt
ful of miſchief, then was his tongue moſt ful of flatterie.
O filthie diſeaſe of flattery, it were better for a
man to follow a dogge, and liue vpon his ſurfating
vomet, then to be a flatterer. O flatery the very intyſing
ſnare of deceit, vnder the which all kinde of
dangers lieth obſcured in Ambuſh, to be ſhort he
was ſuch a one, that ſtill did impoveriſh the Kings
coffers to inritch his own, he did not loue to ſe theſe
to whom he was beholden, to al his friends vnthākfull,
of all good deeds forgetful, and to al wel-deſerving
mindes ingrate. O thou filthie ingratitude, thou
art even the very excrament of all evilles, ill faring,
man faire ill: J muſt leaue thee for my breath
is putrified with ſounding the Trumpet of thy
ignominious imperfections. Ryde on thy poſting
journey, for indeed thou may ride a ſwift gallop to
hell, when thou haſt the Arch-diuell thy guide to
winde his horne before thee, let him who is hulcerus

ſhrink at his owne ſmart, when his ſores are ſerſt.
Now as for the yong aſpyring gallant, J haue moſt
rare and excellent Collours to paint thy portrate
in a trew luſtring forme; take Phyſick to ingender
thy patience, although my ſpeech be Satyrick,
What then? bitter drinkes are goode for the ſtomack,
Therefore come on thou vngratious Boy,
for J muſt haue about with thee, Thou chylde of
vnthrift, when thy parents gives thee ſtore of
wealth, before God giue thee witte to governe:
Then be ſure thou ſelſt all, pawnſt all, and ſpendſt
all. How carles art thou of whats to come? Thou
never thinkſt on want, but playes the infant perdu
freely, ſtill aſſuring thy ſelfe, that thy father hath a
fatted Calfe to be kilde at thy Converſion. Vpon
the hope of this, thou letſt all goe, like the ſmoake
of Tobacco, or like a ſoppy billow, which flees
from the ſhell of the walnut, and ſtraight doth vaniſh
in the aire. It may be thy father or mother, hes
ſcraped this ſubſtance together with labour, hunger
and pinching of their belly: How beggerly
perchance hath thy parents lived to provyde for
thee? How carefull were they to get it? And how
careles how they got it? evill and vnlawfull conqueſſe
makes ſuch Impes of perdition come after
and ſpend all. Thou art like a raging Courſer,
which runnes without a brydle, or rather like a
ſtorme-beaten-ſhip amidſt the Rocks, hauing no
Rudder at all. Thou doeth quintiſcens thy vnderſtanding,
and imploys thy wits, leaving no deceit
vnſought how to get money. Thou intrudeſt thy

ſelfe in the Kings favour, building great authoritie
on his ſmyle; if he grace thee with his eare, then
becōmeſt thou homely, bold, and audatious lying,
cogging and flattering, that the behoulders and
hearers may thinke thee a trew and perfite Courtier
in deed. By this meanes, many men employes
thee to ſpeak to the Prince in their afaires, ſutes, cō
               plaints
and requeſts, are put in thy hands. What is
offered thee for thy paines? Thou wilt doe nothing
till thou get halfe, or all in hand; then thou ſelſt the
poore mans ſute to ſome other, and ſo makes thy
ſhifting delayes excuſe thy ſhameles deceat. If
thou be ſometyme altogether out of money, thou
calſt thy wits to a reckoning, and then diſguiſes thy
ſelfe in ſome ſtrange apparels; and on the his way
will rob the paſſenger of his purſe A King may giue
honor o
                     •
                   knight-hood, but he cannot giue moyen to maintaine
it. After thy robery, then come to Court with
thy bolde erected face, and an impudent geſture
moſt majeſticall, to maske thy rogiſh villany in a
vagabounding humor, thy nights are ſpent in
whowring, ſo thou makſt thy bawdrie &amp; ſpending
in a Bordell. Increaſe thy reputation, and then thy
lecherous life makes the blew circle vnder thy eye.
Tell the world how much thou art over-ſpent inſubſtance
of bodie. Beſides all this the Paliards
token which thou caries of a Merſenary woman,
moſt pleaſant for the Apotecharie, and very profitable
for the Barber. Thou affirmeſt thy ſelf to be of
the Iudayecall law, and much more in going beyond
the Iew in thy vpright Circumciſion. Notwithſtanding,

of all this, every Ladie in the Court, muſt be
thy miſtres, but thy chief choiſe is a gallant, and
moſt quick-witted Lady, whoſe experience knows
what duety belongs to the quiet opening of a back
doore, perfumed ſmocks, a whiſpering voice, and
cloath-ſhooes, &amp; who in a veneryan diſcourſe, with
the want of ſhame, will make her fan ſerue to cover
the bloudles bluſh of her never bluſhing face, thy
want of purpoſe is ſupplied with many apiſh triks,
and in thy interluds doth praiſe her miſtaken beautie,
affirming, that it is not painting makes her faire,
nor that her perfumd breath giues delicacie to the
ſmel, no thou ſwerſt nature hes done al The crew of
vnthrifts are thy comrades, ſuch cumpanions as hes
made compaction with the divell to ride poſte to hel;
when thou commeſt to a taverne, and enters in the
ſecond degrie of drunknes, then playeſt thou the
Rodomontado, and in thy Orlando Furioſo humor, cals
for Oceans of vyne, a world of Tobacco, and whole
mountaines of ſuger, who wil refuſe to carouſe thy
miſtres helth, then is he called the ſon of a whowre,
the wine thrown in his face, &amp; ſtraight cartaliſde to
a combat, thou muſt be ſtout and out-ſwagger al, &amp;
ſtill curſe the coeleſtiall ſignes which are not in Cancer
or Scorpio, to the effect thou may let out thy colerick
bloud, in thy ſwearing moſt horrible, ſo that
the greevous terror of oathes, makes the haire of
the hearers head ſtand right vppe, when the hoſt
brings thee a reckoning, then thou wilt ſweare to
pay all, and ſo takes it in truſt, for J grant it is the
true pendeckles of gentilitie, to black bookes with

reckonings, to hunt with dogs, to play at dyce,
and dally with drabs, and ſometime to make a
cuckold of thy furniſher: when a married man becommes
a Monſter, what kinde of glory is it to ſee
him walk on the ſtreets, with a pair of egregious erected
hornes, and every one poynting their finger
at his horned-worſhip. Thou art of no Religion,
but a meere Athieſt, then aſſure thy ſelfe to liue vnquerrelled,
thy roume and large conſcience will
make thee to eſcape excommunication, becauſe
the Libertine goes alwayes frie, yet for all this thou
goeſt to Church for faſhion ſake, and makes thy
ſeming pietie weare thy brieches on the knees, as
the young Lawyer goes to the houſe of Juſtice,
and without profeit, weares the fore-breaſt of his
gowne on the Bar, ſo that he is forſt to make a ſommer
cloak of the poſterior parte: All this miſerie
proceeds of the want of Clyants, and fearfull complainours,
who dares not truſt the defence of
their action in the hands of ſuch a skil-wauting
Novice. Thou imitating all kinde of ſtrange humors,
ſtill becomes inconſtant in thy cloathes,
Thy traffick is with the Lumbard, thou makes
it thy Gwardarobba, and thy ſerce is amongſt the
Phrepryes, and oft-times a purpoſe thou ſtayeſt
from Court a prettie whyle, that occaſion may
offer thee to returne with a newe faſhion of
cloaths, not vnlike a Cittizens young wyfe, who in
curious pryde of a newe-fangling Humour, will
take the advantage to change her buske vvhen

ſhe comes from her child-bed. Jf thou haſt any
thing, ſell, pawne, borrow, and begge, to buy
knight-hood, thy wife muſt haue a hoode, and be
called Madame, although thou and ſhe ſhould liue
beggerlie, and lay the moſt parte of your cloaths
in lavender, to maintaine the naked ſtyle; it is a baſe
ambition, which brings nothing with it but the
bare name. Povertie maks ſuch ſort of people turne
Cunny-catchers, take vp commodities, skambell,
beg and borrow of their betters, and ſtill liue by the
tryall of their wits, attended on by brokers, who
ſpares not to ſeek &amp; ſerch be al means to know who
will giue their money out for intreſt, making large
and fair promiſes, damning his ſoule to confirme
his lyes, till at laſt with vowes and oathes, he deceaues
his neighbour; and that which an honeſt
man hes gathered with great paines, and longſome
travell, gotten and ſcraped together, to maintaine
him and his family: Then is it put in the hands of a
deceitfull villaine, who never thinks to repay a pennie
of it. How ſoone his credit is loſt? then is he
gone, and becomes bankerout. So is many a poore
man left with his wife and children to make new
ſhift, this is a voluntarie robberie, which a good
conſcience could never yet excuſe. The ſerjants attends
like pages of honor vpon ſuch careles vnthrifts,
whoſe eares are ever attending, I arreſt you
ſir. The dambd Crew, and the ſwaggering Conſort
of companions, hants commonlie about the Court
and capital Citties, and waits on Taverns, the ordinaries,
ſtages playe-tilting, balling, and revelling,

ſo are they at al ſorts of conventions, and with cunning
authoritie becomes pocket-ſerſers, and purſpykers
their promynado is in ſome other parte like
Pauls Church at London, where many poore gentlemen
dines with Duck Vmphra, and then comes to
to the ſtrets ſpaniard-like with an emytie bellie, piking
his teeth, in this abuſed place, theſe imps of vnthrifts
makes their meetings, and there invents
new ſtratagems how to get freſh money, ſome by
horſe, and ſome by foote, will walk like night Owls
on the fields, waiting ſcollers comming from their
friends, farmorers cōming to London, marchants going
to mercats, &amp; lawiers coming from the viſitation
of their clyants, and ſo transforming the word of
God ſaue you ſir, in rander your purſe ſir, they become
obſolut commanders. O they haue no revenues of
lands, this purcheſe makes them go gallant in faire
cloathes, &amp; entertain an horſe &amp; a whore, &amp; ſometime
for neceſſitie ſake, himſelfe will be Pandor; of
what proceedes all this villany? It is true, the King
hath no warres, nor wil not grant Commiſſioners,
nor letters of Mark for the ſea, every Galies and Galias
lying idle and waiſt without ſlaues, ſo that my
Lord cheif Juſtice is forſt to fill priſons, and flooriſh
Tyburn with the lewd conſort of this dambd
Crew. Theſe ſparkes of perdition, caries the
name of Gentle-mens ſonnes, hauing great revenues
and rents, and for the moſt parte are calde
Capitaines, or elſe Lewtenants, aske him where he
was made Capitaine, he will preſently anſwere in
eighty eight, that time when the king of Spains great

               Armado was overthrowne; or elſe in Ireland, when
the Earle of Eſſex was generall. O to heare them tikle
a diſcourſe of valour, what great bravados (as
the Spaniard ſayes) Que ſon Mais los amenazados, que
los acuchilla dos, and how they kill men be apprehenſion,
leads on troups, and never takes them off
againe, Como vno ſpanzola Rodamontado, that ſayes,
his beard grew with ſmook of muſcats, and the
haire of his head decayde with the noyſe of Cannons,
ſuch ſorte of men makes the winde of their
ſtomack become firmeaer, ſo that every word (by
ſelfe conſate, and a lying diſcourſe) appeares in his
owne minde a braue man. Theſe are the men who
affirmes tranſmigratioune, and makes it the chief Article
of their beleif, as when he ſayes, Bota adios io
ſta hidalgo Naſsido, So by imagination, he is the
moſt valorous man that ever lived, he will haue a
ragement, and all his Souldiers muſt haue Monarchs
minds; all his drums muſt be made of kings
skinnes, and preſentlie he will vow and ſweare that
his ſword ſhall kill none except it be Cornels,
Capitaines, e Cavelleros muy honorados. What man
of a ſoled wit wolde not ſmyle to heare ſuch baſe
Cowards diſcourſe, and chiefly in a Taverne, or
elſe in a bordell amongſt whowres, away with ſuch
cogging villains, which are naught els but the very
excraments of mankinde. What may be thought
of the buſſie headed man, who ranges from Countrie
to Countrie, he haunts Courts, and becomes
a ſpye, ſtill curious to ſearch newes and verye
diligent to knowe the ſecrets of all eſtates; in this

point he proves a rare intelligencer, and ſo much
the more by ingyring himſelfe with hanging on the
companie of young and light-headed Courtiers,
with a counterfoot geſture, ſtill plauſible to their
idle humors, at his comming to towne before he
come to Court, he takes his lodging in the ſub-vrbs
and inquyres for the Phrepry, and then, be ſure he
will enter like a Polonian, a Sweiſh, or a Flemiug;
But ô how ſwiftlie will he be chainged in ane Italian,
a French, or elſe in a Spaniſh ſute? In this
new Metamorphus, hee comes bouldlie to the
ſtreete, and makes his promynad towardes the
Court, preſſing (as it were) to accompanie his
vnacquainted apperrell with a borrowed geſture,
making the world poynte at his oulde garment,
furniſhed with newe faſhions, till ſome poore
Gentle-man take notice of his owne late pawnded
ſute. Then (even then) beginnes povertie to make
the true owner bluſhe at the Baſtarde behaviour
of baiſnes it ſelfe, whilſt the boy of the Phreprey
is ſette to attend on his hyrde apperrell, and
ſtill to remember the ſtranger to come back, and
make reſtitution, and that he may leane off the
wal, and alwayes keepe his cloathes cleane. When
he circuits the Palace, he ſcornes to be aſhamed,
but needs will intrude himſelf amongſt Gentle-men
and Ladies, then beginnes Curioſitie to
inquyre whats he? O ſayes one, he is a Traveller,
a man of a moſt rare wit, and of a very quick diſcourſe,
he is an Heretick Poet, who can ryme extempore,
Mitolat-lynes, Stropyat-verſes, with

halting-feete, and make any object his ſubject,
and more then this, he hath the true arte of face
painting, he knowes the ſecreet vertue of complections,
and hee can lay an vpright vermilion
collour vpon the pale cheeks of bloudles Ladies.
What folies and ſuperſtitious vanities may the eies
of Wiſdome beholde in the affronted and damnable
cuſtoms of wicked mankinde, whoſe mindes
are a mirror of miſchief, a bordell to vyce, and an
excramentle corruption of all inormities, it ſmels
of treaſon to knock at the doore of a Kings minion,
ſo with ſcretching (the long waiting petitionar)
nay weare his nales to the fleſh, before he
ſhall be diſpatched, this makes many mal-contented
myndes ſtand vpon the Thaeater of impatience,
behoulding the glittering ſtage of an evill
furniſhed and deformed Court, where blinde Forton
playes a prologue to the triumph of Time, acted
with the abhominable ſinnes of Envy, Pryde, Ambition,
Gluttonie, Avarice and Licherie, &amp;c. But
ô how happie is that man whoſe heart is not polluted
with the imperfection of Court, whoſe
head is not ſtuft with a world of faſcheries, and
whoſe minde is not croſt with tormenting refuſals.
This man is he who liues at home voyde of
treaſon, ſecure without feare or danger, and
moſt ritch with ſweete contentment, it is he who
ſcornes to climbe a falling Towre, and whoſe
chiefe felicitie is not fixed, nor placed vpon vncertaine
toyes, ſo very well may it be ſaid,
            
               
               HOw bleſt is he whoſe happy dayes are ſpent
               Far from the Court, and liues at home in eaſe:
               It's onely he whoſe ritch with ſweete content
               And builds no neſt on top of Caedar trees:
               No ſtorming ſtrife, nor yet no Viprich kinde
               Of treaſons gilt, doth harbor in his minde.
            
            
               He eats that bread, which ſweating labor yeelds,
               With open doores, ſecure in his repoſe;
               He walks alone, abroad on ſpatious fields,
               Goe where he pleaſe, he needs not feare his foes:
               He trades on that, which proud ambition brings,
               And ſcornes the threatning terror of great Kings
            
            
               I grudge to ſee when many a ſcurvie Clowne,
               Of no deſert traumphs, in their deſire,
               And from the top of Honor doth throwe downe

               You painted ſnakes, whoſe bitter poyſning gall,
               With want of pittie, plagues the poore mans purſe,

Ther's no Relax 
                     •
                  or your Eternall curſſe:
               Then curſt be Court, thou monſtrous Map of Hell,
               Where enuy, pryde, and treaſon loues to dwell.
            
            O time, what a pretious thing art thou to be
thus abuſde and wrongde with ſo many? When
thou art loſt, who can finde thee? When thou art
gone, who can recall thee? How happie are they
who employes thee well, and ſpends the not in
hunting idle and vncertaine toyes? What a pittie is
it to ſee braue ſpirites ſo careles of time, and ſtill
waiſting of their wits in vaine? Conſuming their
youthfull yeares in ſuch ſlauiſh ſervice, where vertue
could never harbour, and at laſt guardond with
ingratitude, how oft hath the cowardlie flatterer
cropen in favor, and catched the gallant mans rewarde?
O but the diſgrace of indiſcretion pertaines
to the diſtributer, &amp; not to the wel-deſerving man.
Let the man whoſe meriet is great, put on Patience,
croſſe his armes, and ſmyle at ſhameles ingratitude,
what a ſhame is it for ſuch as are borne
to great ritches, and yet wants nobilitie! O to be
noble now in theſe dayes, it is thought to be prodigal,
and ſo the hearts of higher powers, are tranſformed
in the hearts of avaritious vſurers, who
makes their gould their God, he houlds his hand
faſt, his blinde pryde, and voluntarie forgetfulnes,
thinks every man bound by duetie to ſerue and doe
his vtermoſt, without ſo much as thinks, how ſhall
braue men in this miſerable extremitie liue, or
keepe goode cloathes on his back? ſeing his ſervice
is all his revenues, Poore man, he is forſt to goe ſeek

his forton be ſome other meanes. Becauſe when he
goes to the warres, every Capitaine will be his
Comrad, and if his courage deſerue honor, he ſhall
get it, and what he hath by hazard is ſweete content,
he gets elbo-roume to eate his meate, he needs
not lay downe his cloak in vaine to ſit at the greatmans
table, for if there wants roume, he muſt ſtand
like the pillar of ſalt which Lots wife was turned in,
or elſe ſteale to his cloak, and ſtay for the latter
meate, where never yet was ceremony of ſitting
downe, for he that comes firſt, ſits firſt, and then
ſits like one flightred in rops, if he holde not his
hand on his trinſher, hee may be robd whilſt he
drinks, if he eates at leaſure, he may be ſure to riſe
with an empty belly; if he be hungrie, he muſt ſwellow
all with vncivilitie, and put himſelfe in perrell
of chocking. I think the ſtomack of a latter-meateman,
and the ſtomack of a dog, muſt be very like of
diſgeſture, and their throats of a like meaſure, for
they without vſe of their teeth ſwollows all. At
hunting after the Deere is kild and cwird, then is
his intrals throwne to the hounds, whoſe greedie
appatide, and eager ſtrife, without regarde, ſlabring
the guts about their eares, and every one pulling
from another gormounds filth and all. In
treuth me thinks, there is nothing in ſimilitude, can
come ſo neare the forme of a Courtiers latter-meat
break-faſt, the ſavage rudnes of ſuch creatures, tels
modeſtie, that they never learned, Quos decet in
menſa mores ſervare docemus, They are altogether
ignorant of civill inſtructions, their quick expedition,

makes their patience cry, either a ſhorte
grace, or elſe no grace at all. O what a heavie
croſſe is it for an honeſt heart to liue in ſuch a
graceles and ſlaviſhe life, let him ſerue, waite,
ryd, all is in vaine, and without profite. Beholde
the Catigorie of whiſprers. One will round in his
Lords eare an errant lye; another forge and invent
a ſlattring diſcourſe to pleaſe the humor of his maſters
minde, ſome will doe no good ſervice except
it be in ſight, that he may gaine thanks, and the villane
proues naught elſe but a pyk-thank knaue, and
a back-byter of his deareſt companions. I wonder
but ſome of the wiſer ſort of noble men, ſhold ponder
and conſider very wel, ſic villanie, and ſtil grace
the pyk-thank with a liſting eare, take good heed to
his detracting diſcourſe, and ever ayme at all his actions
with a diligent eie, protect his knaverie with
a ſmyle, why? becauſe ſuch men are mali neceſſarij, ô
but good my lord, beleeue him not without great
triell, take a reckoning of his relation, and keep not
malice in a miſconſtring minde towards an honeſt
man, if it be a mater of importance, which concernes
both honour and credit, then ſpare not to
call the ſuſpected man before thee, and aske him in
ſecracie, if this or that be true, if thou findſt any
knavery, either be malice, or be juſt tryell, guerdone
the honeſt man with honour, and 
                  •
               aſleir the
knaue with ſhame, contrare-poyſon ſuch conſuming
cankers, &amp; keep not ſuch venemous vipers in
thy company, but ſtil away with ſavors of diſcention,
and breeders of mutanie, for how can a cittie

ſtand, or yet hold out againſt the enemie, when it
is devided in it ſelfe: Or if the members of thy bodie
be creſd or feiſtred with filthy ſores: thou who
is the head, can never be well; thy followers are
thy guard; and therfore thy guard that guards thee
ſhould be ſound and of one minde, accompanied
with loue one to another, without envie, grudge,
or malice: and aboue all things, they ſhould carie
a great and awfull reſpect, to thee who is their
onely head and maiſter: thy glory is to ſee all that
attends thee in good equipage; and it is thy ſhame
to ſee men that corrupts good maners, to bide in
thy companie, or to attend thy perſon. The honeſt
geſture decores the grofnes of the apparrell, but
evill education would ſpoile a diadem. If thy ſervant
or retainer, after two or three admonitions refuſe
inſtruction, decard him, and let him goe: becauſe
ſimple ignorance can be no excuſe to arrogant
wilfulnes, be curteous to thy friend, and ſtill
be noble to thy followers. Becauſe they who attends-thee,
are as ſtrengthie pillars of thy eſtate, and
without them thou can not ſtand. Be liberall, but
no wayes prodigall, and as a contagious Peſt, ever
eſchew that filthy and deteſtable vice of avarice.
Contemne that beggerly Canalze, who counſailes
thee, to ſhame thy worth with a niggards minde,
great is the great-mans honour, which conſiſts in a
wiſe ſervant. It is not the diſcreet holding of a great
houſe, will impoveriſh thy ſtate. And it is not thy
noble heart to thy followers will empty thy cofers:
No, it is when the vnthrift in his prodigall humor,

moſt vngratiouſly ſpends his rent vpon change of
whores, and diligent Pandors in ſecret villanie, when
the darkned clouds of the quiet night, brings ſilent
reſt to the honeſt ſort: even then is the ſparkes of
perdition ranging the ſtreetes, and making their
ritcht triumph in bordels. O heavens why made thou
night to cover ſinne: it is this and ſuch abuſe as this
be, that cankers the ſtate of many a man: theſe abominations
breeds many beggers, and drawes down
Gods vnreſiſtable wrath vpon them ſelues, their
houſe, and their off-ſpring. And againe, how will
other miſers ſpend their ritches ſo narrowly, and
yet how ſwiftly will it conſume, becauſe God hath
not bleſſed their portion, ſome will hoard it vp, and
neither hath joy nor comfort of it: they hold in their
hand, and with earneſt eyes over-looks every thing
niggardly: it is they who ever takes a ſharpe reckoning
of the kitchin-Counts, and ſtill giues ſtrait command
to the Butler and Pantry keeper, betwixt
meales to goe take the aire in ſome quiet corner,
where he can not be found. O theſe be they who
ſubſcriues their precepts with a counterfetted Character,
to the effect the deburſer ſhould not anſwer
his Maiſters warrant, but only make payment with
ſhifting delayes. Theſe ſort of men weares their
cloathes till they weare out of faſhion, and than
transformes them in the laſt edition. When this
ma is called to any convention cōcerning his King
or Country, or yet to pleaſure his friends in any affaires,
to eſchew the journey, then be ſure he will
haue the meagrime in his head, a paine in his teeth,

ſome collick in his intrals, either Siatike, or elſe by
guttiſh, then muſt his beggerly worſhip keepe his
chamber, &amp; take ſome Phiſick to expell the humor of
expenſes: they are alwaies deafe when they heare of
any thing that ſounds of asking: they can never be
found in their giving humor, but are alwaies ſtarke
blind at the ſight of the well-deſerving man: this ignobilitates
honor, it crownes ſhame, it treads downe
vertue, it inthrones vice, and makes helliſh ingratitude,
to becom the triumph of time. Should a Princely
ſpirit be ſo baſe, as not to haue a care of the man
whoſe merit is great: ſhould he haue that ingratfull
mind to make a forged fault, rob him of his reward,
and then ſend him to thee yet: or ſhould he haue
that vnchriſtian heart, to let him know of want. O
worſe (yea ten thouſand times worſe) then the verie
hearts of brute beaſts: Curſed be thou ingratitude, the
chiefe of all euils: fie on ſuch beggerly breſts, which
are borne to be Noble, and then containes naught
elſe but pinching avarice. Ocancro, le Spalle d' vn huomo
da bene non debbono portare la ſomma di tante injurie.
O it grieues me mightily that I can not raile enough,
and it grieues me more, that nothing elſe
but bare railing ſhould work revenge vpō the baſe
abuſe of ſuch ſtrange monſters, whoſe degenerate
haerts from true Nobility are gilt overwith golden
words. But what cā be ſaid to a cautariſd cōſcience,
a remorſles mind, or to a hardned &amp; ſenſles heart,
who never died the face of honor with the bluſh of
ſhame, the gentle heart of an honeſt minded man,
bolds his turret of recōpēce vpō the ruinous groūd

of idle promiſes, ſtill credulous, and ever ritch in
naked hope, till at laſt his merit growes ſo great,
that his ſight becomes loathſome to him, who
ſhould reward him. Who is it then that gets and
gathers all the gaines? flattering pick-thanks, vnworthy
fowles, cowardly poltrones, and canailies,
who ſtill keepes begging in requeſt. So ideots,
ſtoyicks, and paraſites, are ritch, when Princes and
gallants are poore. Such is the ſubtilty of ſnakie
hatchers of envious treaſon, and ſubtill villaines.
To ſee two crafty knaues meet in Court, in ſtreet,
or any where, how will they ſalute one another
with ſhaking of hands with low courteſaies, annixt
complements, offers, vowes, and large promiſes
will paſſe betwixt them: how ware will they
be ever doubting, not vnlike two cunning and ſure
Fenſers lying at a ſafe guard: O that then their bodie
were tranſparent like chriſtall, and that an honeſt
man might ſee what hid miſchiefe lies in their
hearts. I thinke the honeſt man might gnaſh his
teeth, to ſee the hote rancounter of equall deceit,
the true race of Babilonian raſcalls, the ſlaues of
pride, and generation of Haman. If any ſuch villaine
haue the credit to gather &amp; take vp his Lords
rents and revenewes, in receaving and deburſing:
then be ſure he keepes the two rules of Arthmetick,
to wit, Substraction and Multiplication, the one
helps him in his receaving, the other in his deburſing,
hee muſt enterline his counts, enlarge his
ſummes, invent new journeyes, exploit all kinde of
courſes that may be expenſive, onely a purpoſe to

make great volumes of reckonings, that his vantage
may be the greater, &amp; his theift the better covered.
Hee robs his Maiſter of his revenewes, and makes
him ſelfe a great rent, and with a godleſſe purchaſe
he liues like a Prince, enritching his owne poſteritie,
and puts his Maiſter ever in debt: the Noble
man thinks him ſelfe to be well ſerved, and that he
hath a faithfull and truſtie ſervant, when the villaine
is a cut-throat, a vnderminder of his Maiſters ſtate,
and brings his lands in morgage: this man will
counſaile his Lord to ſell his lands, and this villaine
will be the firſt will offer him money; theſe kinde
of deeeaving Paraſites are made ritch with falls and
godleſſe conqueſt. O this man is he that hath no
ſoule, he plagues the tenants, and ſtops the eare of
his Maiſter from the poore farmourers complaint:
he hath no compaſſion on the widow or fatherleſſe,
in giving of rewards he robs his Lords honour, being
commaunded, he either giues little, or none at
all: he payes the well-deſerving man with faire excuſing-words,
&amp; the poore diſtreſſed begger with
God help you, but when the purſe-bearers reckonings
are produc'd, how large, how liberall, and
how honourable will he make his Maiſters rewards
to be. O this affronted villaine with a ſhameleſſe
face, and with perjured oathes, will damne the verie
ſoule of him ſelfe. O that the King, the Duke,
Lord, Laird, Maiſter, or the ſuperiour, be what
thou will, would take ſuch a treacherous knaue by
the neck, and ſay, Sirra, giue me a reckoning of my
goods; thou art a cogging villaine, thou art a traytour,

and betrayed me: thou haſt ſtollen my ſubſtance
and begirt me, thy deceit hath over-ſiled my
Parents, robd their lands, &amp; made me to liue in poverty:
thou haſt woone all with falſe dice, lay down
againe, or elſe thou ſhalt ſmart for it. I thinke, be
what thou may be, thou may doe this, and thou may
doe it with auctoritie of a good conſcience, and ſo
giue an example to all coſoning raſcals, to cogging
flatterers, and to all treacherous villaines. When
Generalls, Coronals, or Captaines, receaues pay
from the Prince or his Pagadore, to doe good ſervice
to the Countrey, they who are commanders
of the Armie, will make new Callenders of their
owne enlarging yeares and moneths: for ſomtime
they will make the yeere to be 15. moneths, the moneth
fiue or ſix weekes, to the wrack of the ſouldiers:
and againe, their monters ſhall be given in to
be thirtie, fortie, fiftie, or a hundreth thouſand
ſtrong, when they ſhall ſcarſe be half ſo many men,
ſo that falſe monters is the ruine of a camp, the robbing
of a Prince, and the only deſtruction of poore
ſouldiers by the law of Armes and counſaile of
warres, ſuch caterpillers of a Campe ſhould be
hanged, caſhiered, raked and tortured, and at leſt
get the ſtrapado. Many a Captaine goes gallant, and
playes the bravado with the poore ſouldiers pay:
how can a ſouldier liue, when he gets no pay to
maintaine him. Js it not a great and worthy glorie,
and a mightie courage to the Generalls heart,
when he ſees all his Armie of gallant men in good
equipage, and his Camp well furniſhed. And to

be more carefull for the ſouldiers then for him ſelf,
ſeeing the ſouldier is his defence, and the onely
fortreſſe of his eſtate. O that the eyes of Princes
would not winke at ſuch villanie, and that their
wealth ſhould not be ſo vnworthily beſtowed. A
kings minion that knowes all the ſecrets of the king,
and next to the Kings body, perchance will be an
intelligencer, a factor, &amp; a doer for neighbor Princes,
preſſing to raiſe and keepe them vp, and vnderminding
his owne King and Maiſter, taking large
ſums, ſo that he becomes a Pentioner to a forraine
Prince, yea if it were to ten Kings, he will take of all▪
this buſie-headed and craftie knaue, for all this he is
not miſtruſted, but ſtill advanced and eſteemed to
be a true ſubject, and ſtill thought a man who doeth
good ſervice to his King &amp; Country. Now in this
chirping time of peace, when none triumphs but
cowards &amp; poltrones, ſouldiers and ſchollers are
baniſht Court &amp; Country, they are counted a contagious
Peſt, and vnprofitable inſtruments. What
ſhal we all turne cowards, &amp; ſtill try our patience in
ſuffering wrongs? when the couragious ſouldier begins
to diſcourſe how he hath ſpent his time in wars
he begins to tel in the Winter how he lies in garriſon,
&amp; in the ſpriug-time like a well managed ſhip
going to her voyage, ſo in braue equipage goes he
to the fields commanded by his Chieften, and animated
in his march with ſound of Trumpet, and
tuck of Drummes, if they approach the enemie in
faire fields, they muſt marche in battaile, if the
Campe defende or purſue a Towne, they muſt

enritch them ſelues, make redoubts, and conques
ground, defend their Cannon, ſet their Gabions,
and paliſade their weaker places, the ſouldier muſt
ſtand his houre ſentinell perdew, vnder the mercie
of Musket and Canon, and what is all their ſport?
naught elſe but flying of Colours, ſounding of
Trumpets, touking of Drummes, claſhing of harneſſe,
ſhooting off Muskets, roaring of Cannons,
thundring of vp-blowne-Mines, giving aſſaults, and
getting repulſe with ſundry &amp; thick ſortes, making
retreats, and with freſh courage joyning hote and
fierce rancounters, bringing deſtruction, rape,
bloud-ſhed, murther, and cruell vengeance. O this
fearefull diſcourſe makes the haires of a coward
ſtand right vp, he will not buy honour at ſuch a perrillous
rate, he will ſtay at home and be knighted
either by moyen or money: ſuch is the abuſe of
worthy knighthood, that now every kitchen-fellow
may attaine to, be flattering credit of euil-purchaſd
wealth. Non venit ex molli vivida fama thoro, Dolours,
paines, guts, avarice, ambition, envie the
ſtonie gravell, the plague, inventing of treaſon, and
thouſand worſe infirmities, and worſe diſeaſes are
found and bred by idlenes and ſtaying at home,
much more then in travaile or going in farre journeyes.
I hate this miſerable ſect of Epicurians, who
onely loues to eate, ſleepe, and drinke. Looke on a
drunkard, how the continuall exhauſting of drinke
enflames his face with fire, and transformes his
noſe in a red rock of ſpurtled and white-headed rubies,
whoſe gliſtring luiſter yeelds a vermilion reflex

to palenes it ſelfe: and yet the more the ſtomack
be oppreſſed with the ſtrength of drinke, the
more it heates and dries vp, Quo plus ſunt potae, plus
ſitiuntur aquae, ſuch ſort of tiplers who loues and
hath pleaſure in bibbing and continuall ſupping of
ſtrong drinke: this Epicurian ſect, I ſay, makes their
back &amp; their belly their ſummum bonum. O I blame
the great abuſe of companionrie, who can not keep
ſocietie, and be merrie in honeſt &amp; civill paſtimes:
they think all nothing if that they drinke not drunk:
what a beaſtly thing is drunkennes? and what an
abhominable mother is it to all other ſinnes, it is
the very gate of hell. Alexander the great, when
he had conqueſt the world with valour, yet drinke
overthrew him, and killed him: how many branches
of miſchiefe ſprings from that filthy rowt? J
ſay to thee who hath bene a drunkard, &amp; hath bene
an abuſer of the benefits of God, perchance rather
for the loue of company, then for the loue of drink:
If thou haſt remorſe, and is angry at thy ſelfe, thou
art happy. And I will entreat thee to behold the
beaſtly behaviour of a drunkard, when he is in his
drunkennes, and it will make thee hate drunkennes
worſe then any thing:Eccle. 26. cap. in man it is more then filthy,
and in woman ten thouſand times worſe, becauſe
ſhee can not hide her owne ſhame. J confeſſe and
alow that both men and women ſhould drinke moderatly,
for the better health of their body: but J
thinke it odious, when one ſhall (as it were) force
another to drinke more then meaſure, to ſurfet and
ſpoile them ſelues to this, I ſay with the Italian, è qual

è di pazzia ſigno peu expreſſo: Che per altri, voler perder
ſe ſteſſo: It is a great ſigne of madnes, when any bodie
for the loue of another will kill him ſelfe: To
whom is woe?
               Pro. 23. Cap. 
               to whom is ſorrow? to whom is ſtrife? to
whom is murmuring? to whom are wounds without cauſe?
(and) to whom is the rednes of the face and the eyes? euen
to drunkards. This inſatiable cuſtome is ſo enlarged
within this Iland, that it is in all ſorts of eſtates chā
               ged
from vice to vertue. How many ſundry ſorts of
ſins hath intruded them ſelues amongſt vs; ſtrange
and new invented ſinnes comes from the Court to
the Countrey, like the new faſhions of apparrell:
how new fangled are we to follow them, diſcending
by degrees, for we may ſtill ſee the baſer ſort
ſtriving to imitate their betters, and rather in wickednes
then in goodnes: the Clowne ſtriues in his
faſhious to follow the Gentleman, and the Court
waiting Ladies is counterfaited with the Country
drab, few or none followes the honeſt mans maners
honeſtie, &amp; truth are becomd baniſht traytors, nor
yet dare Charitie come neere Court: the civill and
vpright man hath waited long in the glorious
Coutts of Kings, &amp; can not find favour, he is turned
back wearied, he weeps to ſee a ſcurvie &amp; vngodly
conſort of villaines, crowned with deceit, &amp; wrapt
vp in the painted robes of flatterie, in the Triumph
of thieft, adorned with inequitie in the Chariot
of forgetfulneſſe, drawne to hell with the ſeaven
deadly ſinnes. What can heroyick ſpirits ſay to
the hainous abuſe of pretious time in this laſt and
miſerable age. Let him pittie forgetfulnes, and

ſigh at villanie, or rather let him turne home againe
to burthen his friends when his lands are engaged,
when he hath ſpent all, and left nothing, and when
moyen and mony failed him both at once, he could
not begge a ſuit: he could not buy an Office, nor he
could not get one church benefice gratis: ſuch was
the rage of ingratitude. Let this man J ſay, who hath
ſpent his time, turn; &amp; ſay with that moſt galant mā,
Awfull regard diſputeth not with Kings, but takes repulſe,
and neuer asketh why. We may ſee what ſtrange
paines the worldling takes on him, to be ritch, what
inventions, and with what great induſtrie: behold
the Merchant what he vndertaketh, to be ritch:
what reſtleſſe travailes with great hazard of his life,
compaſſing (as it were) the whole earth to flie povertie,
and leaues no corner in the worlde vnſought:
Impiger extremos currit mercator ad indos
per Mare Pauperiem fugiens per Saxa per ignes. Then
looke againe on the Machanike or artiſant, with rare
inventions of his ſpirit: the diligent labourer of
the ground, with the ſweate of his bodie, and euerie
one by lawfull or vnlawfull meanes wrings
their wits, and ſtill travailes to be ritch. Now let
vs conſider what it is that ritches will not doe? We
may beholde and ſee howe it mendes all deformities,
and oft-times transformes Vertue in Vice:
firſt, it makes the baſe Poltrone proude, the
fooliſh eſteemed wiſe, the ignorant ſtoyick to
be preferred. And it makes a Lord or Chiefe
Commaunder, to honour a borne Raſcall, and
a verie ſlaue by Nature, hee will make him

ſpeake with a covert head, waſh with him, ſit at
meat, and eate in his owne diſh, with a flattering
eare he will entertaine his diſcourſe, ſomtimes with
gravitie, and ſomtimes with ſmiling, as it were to
giue a counterfait grace, to the ignorant Aſſe: why
will it pleaſe his Lordſhip to doe all this? Becauſe
his honour thinkes ſuch men are needefull inſtruments
to ingage them ſelues, and become Cationers
for the Lords debt. A help to furniſh his houſe,
to ſtore his Citchin, and ſtill to lend him money.
O but when this poore deceaved ſot, begins to be
beggerd, then his Lordſhip preſently decards him,
becauſe hee can not ſerue more to make vp a full
hundreth. At laſt, this gulld raſcall comes with cap
in hand, with low-ſtouping courteſie licking the
way with his ſlaviſh knees, and halfe weeping begs
his owne; then his Lordſhip becomes deafe, and
hath no more Iudas kiſſes to beſtow on his fooliſh
worſhip. What may this man thinke of him ſelfe,
and of his deere bought courteſie, the Lord leaned
on his ſhoulder, the Lord called him Sir, and ſtill
bad him cover his head; the Lord ſet him at his
ſide, and dranke healths to him: and now when all
is gone, the Lord payes him with a promiſe, and ſo
bids him farewell. What will ritches doe more?
it will cover villany, invent miſchiefe, and bring
forth treaſon, it betrayes beauty, and makes loue
mercinarie, it corrupts juſtice, and with damnable
deedes damnes the ſoule of mankinde. This deſire
of ritches hath made, and ſtill makes many a man
to hazard all, there is nothing but the worldling

will doe for gold, even all in all: This made that
heroyick and learned Poet crie out, Quid non mortalia
pectora Cogis auri ſacra fames: What ſhall I ſay
to thee who is contented with ſobrietie, and caries
truth in thy heart, when thou ſeeſt the great abuſe
of ritches, it makes thee deſire no more then is ſufficient
to maintaine thee with all, yet for all this, thy
good deedes perchance can not purchaſe it: thy
Lord or Maiſter enranks thee with the deceaved
ſort, and ſo forgets thee! O thou, had I wist what
an excellent plaiſter art thou for the incurable diſeaſe
of repentance. What a great griefe is it to
the well-deſerving man, who hath a promiſe to be
rewarded, and becomes aſhamed to importune his
debter? but O, when he ſtands in his ſight, what a
loathſome booke, becomes he to deſired forgetnes,
which yeelds naught elſe but flattering ſmiles,
and never performd promiſes. Now I ſpeake to the
young aſpiring gallant, learne in time to beware
at other mens harmes, Provide for age and ſicknes.
Looke on the aged Conrtiers, who hath ſpent their
youth in waiting on, they goe ſcambling like Butchers
dogs in Lentron, they are like old cart-horſe,
like out-worne hounds, and the very ſcoffe of time.
Therfore when thou looks on the Anatomie of time,
&amp; hath conſidered the ſecrets thereof, O how deere
ſhould it be to thee, &amp; how ſhould thou behaue thy
ſelfe in this time, to provide for the time to come, if
thou be poore, who wil care for thee, ſuppoſe thou

                           With outward ſhew I ſtriue to make it light:
                           But when the courſe of by-paſt time compeares,

                           O what remedie, time paſt hath no remorſe,
                           Then muſt I needes endure this paine perforce.
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            I thank my God, who with his out-ſtretched armes
hath borne me through ſeas, &amp; over land, giving his

bleſſed Angell charge of me, who never left me in
all my farre and weariſome journeyes, ſo that in
every courſe and hazard of my travailes, his eyes of
mercie hath ever ſhined on me, and many times
hath he delivered me, when deſpairing dangers did
threaten my life. All honour and glory be to thee
my God, and giue me grace that my experience of
time paſt, may governe the time te come. O this is
a perrillous time, the time of miſchiefe and miſerie,
the latter dayes full of calamitie: now is the age of
deceit, when the father doth oppoſe himſelf againſt
the ſonne, the ſonne againſt the father, brothes,
and ſiſters, and all are at ſtrife, every one labouring
how to deceaue his friend, and every one ſeeking
how to betray his neighbour, Bonds, Seales, Obligations,
Sureties, all can not ſerue the turne to maintaine
truth: if thou haue to doe with a man of greater
worth then thy ſelfe, then be ſure he will minas
thee, and ſo pay his debts with threatnings. Wilt
thou appeale him before a Judge, with new invented
ſhifts of Law he will out-wearie thee: with briberie
he will begger thee, and thou ſhalt never be
the better. O thou wicked oppreſſour, and thou
falſe and partiall Judge, what ſhalt thou anſwer to
the head Juſtice of heaven, when God ſayes by his
Prophet Ieremie, Ego ſum Iudex &amp; testis, I am both
Iudge &amp; witnes. O ſayes the wicked man in his hart,
I feare not God, therefore I can not loue him with
my ſoule, nor yet can I loue my neighbour, becauſe
J envie his good eſtate, and covets his ritches, and
would wrack him: ſo J owne no duty to God at all,

nor loue to my neighbour, I ſcorne, ſpurne, &amp; treds
on the lawes of God. O let me never thinke on that
terrible &amp; fearful day of Judgement, nor of the horrible
and endles burning paines of hel. I wil altogether
forget it, becauſe it will make me deſpare, take
away this frivolous word Religion, why? becauſe it
keeps me from my pleaſures, and doeth impriſon
all my fleſhlie liberties, the fooliſh man ſaieth in his
heart,Reu. 22. cap. 
               there is no God. He that is vnjuſt, let him be vnjuſt
ſtill, (ſaieth Chriſt) and let the deceiuer be ſtill deceitfull,
let him dwell in his abhominations, and
triumph in all kinde of wickedneſſe, For behold I
come ſhortlie, and my rewerde is with me to rander
euerie man as he doeth deſerue. The cuſtome of
ſinne and continuall vſe, makes ſinne pleaſant,
aboundance of impietie, and couldneſſe of Charitie

turne againe into thy ſcalbert, reſt and be ſtill. But ô,

and nothing can appeaſe him but repentance. But

like vnto my ſorrow. Our long ſuffring GOD at

hands, they haue a mouth and ſpeakes not, they
haue eies and ſees not, and they haue eares and
heares not, ſuch ſenſles ſtocks and ſtones can not

eis. Let them be lyke vnto Idoles who maketh
them, and let them be deafe, dumbe, and blinde,
let them be altogether ſenſleſſe who putteth their
truſt in them; GOD is a Jelous God, he will not
be mocked, nor deceived, he knoweth all them
who boweth their knies to Baall, and looks on the
filthines of them who commits fornication with the
whore of Babel, He hath marked all them that drinks
the poyſonus dregs of her abhominations, what
anſwere giues the diſſembling Hypocrite to this? O
ſaieth he, I did it to ſaue my life, my lands, and my
poſſeſſions, or to get miantainance to ſuſtaine me.
O thou faint-hearted coward, thou fearſt that man
who hath power to kill the bodie onely,Mat. 10 cap. but thou
fearſt not God who hath power to kil both ſoule &amp;
bodie, and to caſt thee in hels fire. If thou think either
ritches, thy wife, or thy children, or thy Countrie,
better then Ieſus Chriſt, thou art not worthie
of him, nor thou ſhalt never be pertaker with him
in glorie. Yet thou wilt reaſon farther, and ſay, O I
did it onely in outward ſhew of body but not with
my heart. Now I will aske thee againe? if thou had a
wife whom thou loued well, and if thou fand thy
wyfe, lying in the boſome of a ſtranger, adulteratting
her body? would thou not ſay, O wife thou haſt
wronged me, thou haſt violated thy matrimoniall

vowe before God, the world and me: Then if ſhe
ſhould ſay, dear husband, I haue lent this man onely
my bodie, but I keepe my heart to you, what a villanous
excuſe wolde this be? wolde thou not repudeat
her,Reue. 3. cap. abandon her, and forſake her? Even ſo will
our living God doe to thee, he will ſpew thee out of his
mouth, becauſe thou art neither hote nor colde. And yet
for all this, hear the comfortable ſpeech of God his
kinde intretie, his vnſpeakable mercie (ſaieth he)
Although the man forſake his wyfe for her adulterie, yet
I will not forſake thee;
               Ier. 3. cap. 
               thou haſt played the harlot with
many louers, after many ſtrange Gods haſt thou gone aſtray
turne againe to me, ſaith the Lord. I will receaue thee,
&amp; if thou wilt not turn again, what ſaith the Prophet
Dauid, Niſi conuerſi fuerit is gladium ſuum vibrauit, arcum
ſuum tetendit &amp; par auit illū.
               Pſal. 7. If thou convert not,

goe againſt the Turks, Iews &amp; Infidels, either to convert
them, or elſe to confound them, Vt edificentur

wil not make reſtititutiō of wrangous geir, nor
wil pay duety for oppreſſion, ſo that the iniquitie of

               Exod. cap. 20. Want of feare makes the ſinner ſenſles,
they builde ſo much on faith, that the pride of their
faith makes them faithles: in whom I (ſay againe)
ſhall the vpright man truſt when the world is ſo full
of deceitfull villany? Beware of that man (ſayeth
the Italian) who giues thee fairer words then he
was wont to giue thee, for he is either minded to
deceaue thee, or elſe he hath deceaved thee alreadie,
then againe the Italian cryes out, De gli 'amici
mei guarda me dio d' gli inimici mei, guardro benio.
And yet for all this, what if a man had Argus eies
to watch deceit? Yet hee may be deceiued, ſuch is
the craft of the ſubtle deceiuer. O thou deceiving
Hypocraſie, what an Eie-blinding behaviour?
What an externall ſhew of chirping pietie putſt
thou on to mask thy damnable deiling? The pride
and envy of the heart, covered with out-ward diſſimulation,
ſeemes to correct vyce, and ſpit at ſinne,
thou walkſt on the ſtreets with a down-eaſt look to
Hell? thy modeſt apparell is the onely coverture of

               Through couetouſnes ſhall they with fained words, make

marchandries of you, their judgement is not far off, and

arrogant and euer ſcorning to be cenſurde with the

more auncient and grauer judgements. Jt is no
wonder, but the wonder of this (wondrous error)
ſhould make the hearers amaſd. Who would not
ſmyle at the geſture of a young Philoſophical fellow

Philoſophorum) to hear him in his tedeus talk of
Jugling ſopheſtry, in ſuperfluous circumlocutions,
in his far-fetched exemples, in baſe applications, &amp;
in a never-ending diſcourſe, ſeemeth to himſelfe a
moſt rare ſcoller by art, &amp; then by nature he proues
not elſe but a redicolus foole; theſe are they whom
the Apoſtle S. Paul bids you be ware of, that their
vain deceiuing Philoſophy corrupt you not, which are not

Mutebanky in Italie are not ſo full of deceit, but
I grant in their ſubtle villanies, they goe farre beyond

not ane Aſtronomicall villaine, joynd with a dreaming
Aſtrologitian villan, make and invent leiſings,
it is they who will take vpon them to tell whats to
come, and ſeeke to prejudge God of his glorie, it is
they who wil tell the alterations of time, the change
of weather, and in what eſtate a mans bodie ſhall
be in, for that yeare into come. I thinke ſuch Fortun-tellers
or ſuch Aegiptian-palmiſters, when they
ſet downe ſuch Phyſicall rules to a man or womans

becauſe he lives him nothing to ſay, ſeeing he in

and ſo audatiouſlie intrudes himſelfe in the

Phyſitian with that honour which is dewe vnto him,
becauſe of neceſsitie,
               Eccl. 38 cap. 
               for the Lord hath created him.
Then I will ſpeake againſt ſuch phantaſtick fellowes,
which I haue ſeene heere in this Iſle of Britaine,
and in many other forraine Countries (where
I haue travelled) profeſſe the Art of Medicine, and
produce their great Charters, and Patents, ſealde
and ſubſcrived where they haue bene made Doctors,
and then they are noght elſe but the very abuſers
of Phyſick, what a deriſion is it, to heare &amp; ſe
Domine Doctor diſcourſe with a borrowed Countenance,
and commonly at meat over the table, without
reſpect of perſons? O ſaith he, you muſt not eate
of this, it offends the ſtomack; ſuch and ſuch is reſtoratiue,
and this againe breeds conſtipation, this
is laxatiue, this breakes winde, and expels the
Collick, and this is your onely meat for confirmde
ſtones, it purges the raines, and diſſolues quickly, O
what a ſcurvy diſcourſe is this for the ears of a cheſt
and skunring-hearted Ladie? and cheefly at meat to
talk of confirmde ſtones, purging of raines, and diſſolving
quickly. Fy vpon it, I thinke it ſhould not be
ſuffred, &amp; yet for the faſhions ſake, my Lord Doctor
will not ſpare to produce ſome place of Gallein to
make his leyſings good and currant. Then beginneth
he to frame a large Comenter vpon a borrowed
text, interluding ſuch a long Parentheſis, till at
laſt his haulting ſpeeches makes him altogeher

forget the origenall of his former ſubject. O how
will he heſitat when his long diſcourſe beginnes to
challenge memory, then obruptly will he change
purpoſe not vnlike a bloud-hound which hath loſt
his ſent. Woe be to poore patients comes vnder
the Cure of ſuch ignorants, who ſcarce can deſcerne
a docken leafe from Tobacco. And yet he will
ſay, that he is a rare herbeſt, how oft he viſits the
ſick, as oft muſt he viſit gould, or elſe his viſitation
is ſtark naught: When he feeleth the punſes of any
diſeaſed perſon, O ſaieth he, it is an Ague, a raging
fever, houlde you warme, keepe your ſelfe quiet,
let no bodie moleſt you, I will come againe, and
ſee your water: Then the next time he comes with
a conſort of Cut-throts like himſelfe, and after
many whiſpering doubts, they call the Apotechar,
and giues him a Recepie of I knowe not what, which
poyſones the poore diſtreſſed patient, and ſo ſends
him to his everlaſting home. Then doeth their ignorance
lay the fault on God, or elſe on the poore
Patient, ſaying, he would not be reuld, nor commanded,
he would not obey their precepts; and
they make the man or the woman author of their
owne death. When the Painter is asked why he
left his trade of painting to become a Doctor of
Phyſick. O ſaid he, when I was a Painter, all the
world ſaw my errors, but now being a Doctor of
Phyſick, I make the earth to burie my wrongs, they
ſeeke forth the life and ritches of mankinde. Well
may ſuch ignorants be calde, the Officers of death,
for the life of mankinde, is the tryell of their drinks,

and with their poyſning drogs, they furniſh graues,
and feeds wormes. When the Patient is dead, the
Doctor muſt be payde for all his viſitations, the Apotechar
for his drogs, the Barber for his Inſitions,
Fmmetings, Vnguents, Cataplaſms, Emplaſterings,
Balmes, and mollefying Ceir-cloaths, this muſt all be
payed and much more. What if worſe, none except
it be Charlytous, Brokers, and Vſurars, fleſh-flees,
that ſtill gnawes vpon glad backs, bloud-ſuckers, &amp;
a contagious peſt to a cōmon-wealth. Why ſhould
not ſuch devoring gulfs be diſcovered? and why
ſhould not ſuch hulcerous phiſters be bard and tented,
&amp; Rogry ſtriped naked? wno ſhould not vnmask
the worlds ſhedowed villanie? The beggerly inventiō
of a ſubtle Pandros, the exploits &amp; tricks of a mercenary
whore, the fals reckoning hoſt, the marchants
perjurie, and the Lawyer deceit; but O I doe not
meane be that Lawyer whoſe conſcience and ſoule
is not ſpotted with murthering brybrie, who hath
compaſſion on the poore complainour, and taketh
the tears of the diſtreſſed widow for good paymēt:
No, I meane be a Ianus-headed Lawyer who hath one
face to his Clayant, &amp; another to the Compeditor,
whoſe ever-gaiping hand muſt ſtill be anoynted in
the Palme with the holie ounction of Gould,
who muſt be courted like a whore with the ſight
of Angels, ſtrange peeces of gould, and purſe
pennies. Woe be to many heart-tortred Clyants,
whoſe right dependes vpon the defence of an avaritious
Lawyer. It is ſuch poore ſoules who
hath their ever-warſling mindes intreacated in a Laborinth

of woes, circumveind with innumerable
faſheries, and ſtill deceived with delayes.
            Patientia pauperum non peribit in finem.
            Therefore, O man, arme thy ſelfe with Patience
in this miſerable time, and couragiouſlie fight it
out; for ſo long as thou art heer into this little progreſſe
of thy lyfe, great is thy battell, and many
are thy miſeries which doeth oppoſe themſelues
againſt thee; like vnto the reſtleſſe motion of
the ſea, one trouble being gone, another followes.
Many ſorrowes, and few pleaſures, when
we expect joy, then comes greefe, every one hath
their owne croſſe, ſome les, ſome more. As poverty
to an honeſt heart brings miſery, greef of minde, &amp;
melancholy, becauſe he conceals his want, and can
not practiſe ſhameles ſhifts to perrell honeſty, ſicknes,
&amp; many a languiſhing diſeaſe, which is lade before
mankinde. Oppreſsion, when thy betters doeth
abuſe thee, taks thy wealth, &amp; thy lands, puts the widow
and the fatherles to begry. Loſe of friends; when
they who ſhuld help thee are gone, &amp; hes no body
to comfort thee in thy deſtres. Ship-wrack when thy
ſubſtance is loſt by ſea, &amp; thy life indangered. Baniſhment,
when thou in a ſtrange country, becomes a
poore ſtranger, far from thy own ſoyle, thou liueſt
an out-caſt, and thy enemies injoyes thy ritches at
home. Priſon, when the croſſe of rancountring miſfortunes,
doth impriſon many a man within a Jaill,
or caſts him in chaines within a Galies, triumpht over
with Raskals (and as it were) the very reſting

place of all wrongs, when a gentle heart is forſt to
harbor patience; and when revenge in a gallant
breaſt turns coward, O this earthly hell, which hes
no other Muſick, but locking of doores, the noiſe of
irons and chains, the heavy complaint of diſtreſſed
priſoners, lockt with bonds in miſery, conſuming in
ſtink and filthines. This ſaid the Apoſtle S. Taul, Remember
them that are in bonds, as if ye wer in bonds with
them, ſo that every one aught by charitable works to
haue compaſſion on the poore diſtreſſed priſoners.
Saith not the Prophet Dauid with great grief of hart
Let the ſighing of the priſoners come before thee O Lord:
as though he wold ſay, O Lord God, conſider the
great anguiſh of their hearts, take mercy on them,
and releue their wants, how heavy and comfortles
is this grievous cros. Some again are croſt with loſe
of honor, when a man either falles in diſgrace, and
commits ſome baſe and filthy fact, or when he ſuffers
wrong, and can not repare himſelf, the croſſe of
mariage where there is no peace, quietnes, nor reſt,
voyde of all contentment, and ever barking, and ſo
makes the devill ſmyl at their diſſention. And what
can be ſaid to the croſſe of idle loue, which hangs
on the ſhoulders of all ſortes of people, as well maried
as vnmaried. In this Frenaſy many ould dotardes
beginnes to renue their declyning age,
and takes vpon them the apprehenſion of youthheid,
whilſt their gray haires, and hairles heads,
reckones vp their yeares, and telles the worlde
their folly, Turpe ſenilis amor, it is more tollerable
in youth, ſo that it be not ſuperſtitious loue;

as ſometimes to faſt from meate and drink, watching
the nights, and ſending their lamentations
written with bloudie letters, railling on crueltie;
and being alone in their retearing walks, they ſurfat
the ſolitarie deſerts with the ſorrowfull voice of
a diſcontented minde, with weeping eies in ſplaine
of paſſion, O ſaieth he,
            
               THe furious force of loues conſuming fire,
               No tyme can quench, nor thoght can not expell:
               Such is the reſtles rage of my deſire,
               Which makes my wits within my ſelfe rebell:
               Thus am I wrongd, and euer ſaikles ſlaine,
               I ſhift my place, but can not ſhift my paine.
            
            They ever eſteeme their paines worſe then the
paines of hell, ſuch are the ſort of penetential lovers,
who are alwaies Anatomiſd with humorous follie.
&amp; yet how often comes it to paſſe, that they who
taks moſt pains to pleaſe, are moſt diſpleaſd, for it is
knowne be vnfallable experience, that the duetifull
lover in a reſpected perſute, is often rejected with
many ingratfull diſdains. For ſome they are which
are Monſters in the womaniſh ſex, will hate that
man moſt, who loues her beſt, and yeeld her ſelf to a
cowardly pultron of no deſert. And againe, we may
evidently ſee, how ſome men of a curriſh &amp; maſtiſh
kinde, will be moſt careleſſe of that woman who is
moſt carefull of him. Such are the vnthankfull diſcords
and interviewing controverſies, of this frivolous
thing which the world calleth Blinde-loue,
it is not the ritch apparell, nor the rare bewtie,

nor the art of curious engines, nor yet is it the gorgeous
geſture of a glorious woman, which makes
the woman: it is the good education, which brings
forth good qualities, &amp; it is the vertue of the mind,
which doeth produce diſcretion, makes the woman
a perfit woman; and that man, may truly be
called a perfit man, who makes wiſedome the vnſeperable
companion of valour, whoſe liberall
minde aymes at honour, and whoſe couragious
heart treads on feare to conques fame. O it is not
the externall ſhew of a Peacocks pride, who with the
geſture of his painted plumes, ſeemes to threaten
Kingdomes: it is not the man of perſonage, nor the
robuſt nature, neither is it the quantitie, but onely
the qualitie doth the turne. A woman may ſeeme
very coy in braue attire, with a faire face, and yet
a whore: a man may be cloathed in fine cloathes,
he may be very ſtrong of body, of a great ſtature,
and he may in a feareleſſe humor diſcourſe of valour,
but when it comes to the puſh of Fortune, he
may proue naught elſe but a faint-hearted-coward,
a turne-back to courage, and a runne-away from
honour. What a world of vanity is it to ſee a painted
fellow, that can doe nothing elſe but court a
woman, how effeminate will he be, and how prodigall
will the tongue be to lend vowes to the hart:

                  Nec jura retine, veneris per juria venti
                  irrita, per terras &amp; freta longa ferunt.
               
How perrillous is it to beleeue a Lover, how tempting
will their words be, and how will they ſtraine
them ſelues to ſpeake with vehemencie. Lady Rethorick
               
ever hants the mouth of a Lover, and with
borrowed ſpeeches of braver wits, doeth enlarge
their deceit, his perjured promiſes, his oathes, his
vowes, his proteſtations, his waiting-on, and all
his iron ſences drawen to feed vpon the actractiue
humors of her Adamantall beautie, as when the
ſong or liſping ſpeech of a Syranicall wench doth
enchaunt his eares, the feeling of her too-much
tempting fleſh, doth intangle his touch, her perfumed
breath doth ſweeten his ſmell, the nectar of
her laſcivious kiſſing, giues delicacie to his taste,
and her petulant beautie feedes his ſight, her ſmile
is his heaven, &amp; her frown is his hell, ſhe is the only
idoll of his minde, for when he ſhould ſerue God,
he worſhips her, if hee comes to Church, his looking
on her behaviour takes away his hearing,
robs him of devotion, and makes him a ſenceleſſe
blocke, with ſtaring in her face, hee learnes the
Arte of Phiſiognomie, his vaine apprehentions
will reade a womans thought in her viſage, and
when hee lookes on her hands, O then hee becomes
a rare Palmiſter, for hee will not ſpare to
reade her fortunes by lynes, for heere (ſayes hee)
is the true ſcore of death, and there goes the
ſcore of life, from this part comes the venerian
ſcore, and if this cloſe with that, ye may be aſſured
to looſe your Mayden-head, it is onely this
makes the too-much beleeving wenches deſpaire
of their virginitie, his braines are tormented
with new inventions, fancie leades him to a frenſie,
next lunaticke, and if hee eſcape madneſſe it

ſelfe, hee may thanke GOD. Hee ſpendes the
time in his Chamber, with no other thing but
with a great Looking-glaſſe, how to take off his
Hatt, how to make his geſture, and in a diſcourſe
how to frame the motion of his hands, to kiſſe
his finger, to make courteſie with his legge, to
ſet his arme, to ſmile, to looke aſide, to walke,
and then hee ſtands gazing on the full proportion
of his owne bodie, which J ſweare is not elſe
but the verie true image of ſuperſtitious vanitie.
When the Miſtreſſe of his deſires beholdes the
Lovers dilligent attendance, then to keepe the
Lover ſtill proude in a ſlaviſh ſervice, often times
ſhee will in a willing ſloathfulneſſe, make her
Gloue or anie ſuch thing fall, that hee ſtouping
may attaine to that looked-for-honour, to kiſſe
what hee takes vp, and ſo receaue a ſmile for his
offitious humour: Hee will entertaine her dogge,
keepe her Fanne, call to light Torches, holde vp
the Tapeſtrie, bring the Coach, and with a
loude voyce hee will call, to make way for my
Lady, to make vowes, weare favours, and doe
pennance, they are the true follies of idle loue,
but once beeing cooled of that hote and lunaticke
frenzie, O howe will hee then bluſh at his
owne folly, when hee beginnes to examine his
wits, and conſiders with him ſelfe how farre hee
hath gone aſtray. But what can be ſaide to ſuch
who wants grace to make a retreat, but ſtill dwels
in that endleſſe miſerie, they never wearie,
but thinkes all ſlaviſh paines pleaſure, ſome by

night with muſick, ſome with walking in her ſight,
ſome with gifts, ſongs, letters, and convoyes, every
one by degree doeth pouſe his Fortune, and every
one by degrees counterfets their betters. I often
ſmiled to ſee a Pandorly-fuſtian-Raſcall, lead a mercinarie-Perpetuana-drab,
there is nothing invented
and put in practiſe by higher eſtates, but the baſer
ſort doe ſtill ſtriue to imitate, and chiefly in apparrell.
It is moſt true that a man is to be commended,
if he be cleanly, and chiefly in his linings, his haire
well dreſſed, his beard well bruſhed, and alwayes
his vpper lip well curled, with an freſado vp-ſtart,
as if every haire would threaten to pull out his eyes,
for if he chance to kiſſe a Gentlewoman, ſome rebellious
haire may happen to ſtartle in her noſe,
and make her ſneeſe, ſo by this meanes, he applies
both phiſick &amp; courteſie at one time, then he may
freely ſay, God bleſſe you Lady, receaving back
the chirping Eccho of I thenk you ſir. But looke againe
on the other part of ſnotty noſd Gentlemen,
with their drouping muſtaches covering their
mouth, and becomes a harbroy to meldrops, and
a ſucking ſponge to al the watery diſtillations of the
head, he will not ſpare but drinke with any bodie
whatſoever, and after hee hath waſhed his filthie
beard in the cup, and drawing out dropping, he wil
ſuck the haire ſo hartily with his vnder lip. I aske
at Civility, if ſuch a poyſonnous ſup can be wholſome?
of if the kiſſe of ſuch a ſlavering mouth be
ſweet? Farre may ſuch beaſtly filthineſſe be from
handſome and perfit men, who ſtil attends vpon the

handy labour of pittifull Ladies, if a Lady be a perfit
woman indeede, and ſtill aymes at honeſtie:
what although ſhe hit not the marke of gentilitie?
yet the pendicles of her deſires ſhould be cleanly:
as ſhe her ſelfe is moſt daintie, neate, pollite, and
fine in all things, and chiefly in her ſleeping chamber,
to ſee the whitenes of her linings, the cleanlineſſe
of her night-cloathes, her chamber-pot filled
with ſweet flowers (to ſtay the ſtur of water) her
perfumed odours, ſweet-waſhing-balls, Pomanders,
ſundry ſorts of ſmelling waters, fannes, hatts,
feathers, glaſſes, combs, brouches, ruffes, fallingbands,
red and white face-colours, ſcarfes, vardingales,
artifitiall locks of curled haire, with vp-ſtanding-friſadoes,
their ſmoothing-skin-clouts, night-ſmocks,
muffels, maskes, petticotes, waiſtcoates,
gownes, picadels, attires, chaines, carkats, caſes,
coffers, boxes, and many things more, that if a man
intrude him ſelfe in a Ladies bed-chamber, &amp; look
vpon every thing about him, he ſhal think him ſelfe
to be no elſe where, but in an evil deformed ſhop of
Merchandiſe. But on the other part, looke vpon
filthineſſe it ſelfe, when ſome women in a ſluttiſh
eſtate, hath their bed-chamber like a ſwines-ſtie,
ill-favoured (and vnſcoured) Piſpot, their combs
and bruſhes, full of looſe haire and filth, their foule
ſmocks ill laid-vp, their knotty phlegme and ſpetting
on the walls and floore, the black and ſlaverie
circle on their lips, ſweating, ſmoaking, and broathing
in their vncleane-ſheetes, that if any would
hold their head within the bed, I thinke the ſtrong

ſmell were an excellent preſervatiue againſt the
Peſt, and none like it, except it be the jumbling of a
Jakes, or of a Cloſe-ſtoole: for it is a true Maxeme,
that the force of ſuch odious and hatefull
ſmells, doth occupie the ſence, and holdes out the
peſtiferous aire of the Plague, GOD forbid, but
the beaſtly filthineſſe of ſome women, ſhould
make the delicate and fine faſhions of other women
(who are civill and honeſt) appeare pleaſant.
And even ſo, why ſhould not the graue and good
life of a diſcreete woman (who feares GOD)
make the filthie faſhions of an harlot (whoſe actions
are moſt abhominable) appeare loathſome to
the world? and ſtill to be diſdained and hated of all
honeſt Matrones. What a monſtrous thing is it,
when a ſhameleſſe woman caries the jewell of impudencie
on her fore-head, giving her boldneſſe
to exploit any thing, and to execute all her filthie
actions without anie reguard: Farre be it
from mee to crie out againſt the modeſt Matrone,
the chaſte Widowe, or yet to miſconſter the civill
behaviour of an honeſt Virgine, whoſe education
is true Vertue, who reſolues conſtantlie,
and performes wiſely, and whoſe doubtſome actions,
are all mixtured with feare, and accompanied
with a Virgine bluſh, in everie thing diſcreete,
a graue geſture, a ſpotleſſe ſpeech, a moderate
ſmile, and a chaſte minde, and whoſe
thoughts are not polluted with leacherous exploites:
Such ſort of women are to be valued at
a high price, they are of great worth, and moſt

worthie to be honoured and eſteemed of by all
men, when vilde and brutiſh women (that is robbed
of all vertue, and loaden with vice) makes the
tranſparent perfection of a good woman ſeeme
glorious to the ſecret ſight of God, and to the outward
ſhew of the world? ſo J do what I can to imitate
the skild Painter, who makes a darke ſhadow,
giue a bright luſter (&amp; an ſhining life) to his vpright
colours. Why ſhould not filthie kennels avoyde
the corrupted excraments of Nature from faire
ſtreetes? And why ſhould I not ſtriue to make an
honeſt behaviour, ſpurne at a ſhameleſſe geſture?
and I doe not doubt but the wiſer ſort will ſpurne
at the increaſe of ſuch ſuperſtitious vanities that are
in this preſent age, and the great aboundance
of idle, ſtrange, and new invented toyes: as
when ſome women deckes and trimmes themſelues
of purpoſe to tempt the eyes of man. And
ſetting forth their wantonneſſe (which is compounded
of all kinde of farre-fetched faſhions)
that everie one may reade in their apparrell, as it
were in a Cart. The deſcription of all forraine
Countries, with ſuch new additions of Art, as
ſeemes in dumbe ſhewes, to ſay, What lacke you

commaund of Saint Paul,

               That a woman ſhould be arrayed
in comely apparrell, with ſhamefaſtneſſe and modeſtie:
And what ſayes the Prophet Iſaiah, The daughters
of Sion are haughtie, and walke with ſtretched out
necks, and with wandring eyes, walking and minſing as
they goe, making a tinkling with their feet. And what

ſayes he more,5. Cap. 
               Woe be vnto them, that draw iniquitie
with the cords of vanitie, And are not theſe things
the true cords of vanitie, which drawes both man
and women to eternall deſtruction: Our Saviour
affirmes it,5. Math. 5. Cap. ſaying: Whoſoeuer looketh on a woman to
luſt after her, hath cōmitted adulterie with her in his hart.
And for all this, how often falls men vpon the ſtumbling
blocks of iniquitie: the wiſe man ſayes, Stumble
not at the beautie of a woman, beware of all her inſnaring-engines,
for they are many and very tempting.
            
            
               CAn not thy eyes, the eyes of man command:
               Hath not thy face ſufficient force to kill,
               But that thou muſt vngloue thy juorie hand,
               Whoſe beautie robs proud Cupid of his skill:
               So with thy hand thou ſhootes Cupidous darts,
               And ſhootes at naught but at poore Lovers harts.
            
            But how can that man eſchew, ſuch fleſhly temptations,
who makes their companie his ſummum bonum,
when all his felicity is placed vpon their dauncing,
ſinging, ſpeaking, playing, and with ſweet

               And when thoſe pearle of Orientall-rankes

               But oh behold, Nature in mourning weede
               Weepes to be wrong'd with ſuperstitious Art,
               For what can braines of rare inuention breede?
               Or what's vnſought which pleaſure may impart?
            
            
               The ſharpeſt wit whoſe quicke deceauing ſtill

                  Ʋaine trifling ſnares, mixtur'd with Magicks skill,
               So Art adds that which Nature doth denie.
            
            
               
               And thus much more ſweet Syrens ſongs ſhe ſounds,

               Oh, then the poore Captiued wretch abounds

               By furious force of Fancie more than mad,
               With fond deſire in reſtleſſe courſe he hunts:
               Blinde Loue can not diſcerne the good from bad,
               When on the eye-plum'd tayle of pride it mounts.
            
            
               The curious minde makes choiſe of good or ill,
               Then ſcales the Fort of his Engine to clym

               Perfect in that predominates in him.
            
            
               Drunke with the wonders of a worthleſſe worth,
               From proſpect of a looking-glaſſe he takes
               Strange Apiſh trickes to ſet his folly forth,

               When fooliſh feates no waies will ſerue his turne,

               Thus gallant ſprights doe quinteſence their wits,

               On idle toyes, at which high honor ſpits,
               Nor memoriz'd memorials remaines.
            
            IS it not ſaid? that faire windowes, laſcivious
lookes, curled locks, the diſcovered mountaines
of the moving breaſt, often croſſing of ſtreetes, and
the hanting of aſſemblies, are the true harbingers,
and fore-runners of venarie. A leacherous bed, is
commonly decored with all kinde of allurements,
for the better execution of vulgar actions, and the
ſecret diſcharge of 
                  Ʋenus laſcivious miſteries, painted
with the true colours of Ouids works, as the diſguiſing
of naked Gods, and 
                  Ʋenus dallying with
Adonis, Tarquin at ſtrife with Lucrece, Hero ſporting
with Leander, and ſuch other wanton Objects with
prettie conceites, to encourage the vnwilling, and
to warme the cold humor of froſtie deſires: beſides
all this, the ſheetes muſt be perfumed, and ſundry
fine drying cloathes, ſome well furniſhed glaſſes of
delicate reviving liquors, to giue a new life, and to
make a more ſwift reſurrection to the fatigated
creatures. The often change &amp; mixtures of many
ſundry natures, doth hinder the propagation and
iſſue of children, and ſo reguardleſſe women by

this meanes giues luſt free libertie, ſo to the eyes of
the world, with ſimple denials they liue long honeſt.
There is nothing more profitable to a Tavern,
then well-skilled (and pretty wenches) it makes the
wine to haue an excellent guſt, it covers the imperfections
of the houſe, and giues a Curtaine to all
kinde of corruption. To mercenarie women all
ſorts of men are welcome, the Clowne as well as
the Courtier, the Raſcall, the Gentleman, the Boy
as well as the Maiſter, it is onely gold and gifts
makes choiſe, if they conceaue with childe, what
then? ſome women feareleſſe of Gods heavie
wrath, will take drinks to deſtroy her conception,
and ſo commits a murther againſt Nature: and
what's more againſt Nature, then that abhominable
ſinne of Sodomie? O what filthy and ſtrange inventions
hath mankinde, to ſloken the fierie luſt of
the fleſh? but beholde what is the end of all ſuch
filthineſſe, ſuch beaſtly luſt, worſe then beaſtly, becauſe
the brute beaſts keepes the rule and direction
of Nature, &amp; they againſt Nature hath no appointed
time in particular, but takes their time in all
maner of times. And I ſay againe, what is the end
of this abhomination? and what reward hath God
prepared for ſuch wilde creatures, Gli ſcadali, Gli
homicidi, la pregione, le Crapuli, gli morbi, ele bestemmie,
ſono la legitima prole del putaniſimo, They are
the true children of whoring, &amp; the true off-ſpring
of filthy luſt: the tormented Italian lying martired,
cries out, Donna ma fatto, E donna ma disfatto. Who
ſhould pittie ſuch ſort of miſerable Caitiues?
            
               
               Non ſi doilga d'altrui, non ſi lamenti,
               Chi da Cagion, ai ſui propitormenti:
            
            That honeſt and vniverſall woman, Miſtres Werolle
gaue a generall command, that Mounſieur Camuis
ſhould by no meanes brangell his joynts, nor yet
play at Iaktaleg: Is it not ſaid, that fire, water, and
women, are the greateſt three daungers in this
world. The old and learned Father giving his opinion
of the luſtfull perſon, and what harme it brings
with it, he ſayes, Luxuria ſenſum habetat, confundit
intellectum, memoriam obdurat, euacuat ſenſum, obnubilat
viſum, reddit hominem pallidum ac foeàum, ſenectutem
inducit, mortem deni
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   maturat. All theſe miſerable
things are the true revenewes of leacherie,
when vaniſhing beautie begins to decay, and then
lookes in a Mirror, then it ſhall ſee the ſtrange ruines
of time, the wrinkled impreſſion of vnwelcome
age, which blinde vanitie never did looke
for: they ſhall beholde their eyes ſunke in their
head, and their face all disfigured. Let the moſt
beautifull body that ever was in the world, be but
foure houres deprived of life: how hard favoured
will it be? how loathſome both to the ſight and
ſmell will it become? then where ſhall the Prophet
of Painting be? where is the vertue of complexions?
and where is all the Engines that did abuſe
beautie? all thy fairding can not helpe the defects
of Nature, at laſt, it will bewray it ſelfe. O but
heare what that learned and godly Father S. Augustine
ſayes, Fucare figmentis quo vel rubicundior vel

candidior, vel verecundior appareant adulterina fallacia
eſt: quanta amentia effigien mutare naturae, picturam
querere: tollerabiliora prope modum in adulterio
crimina ſunt, ibi enim pudicitia hic Natura adulteratur:
And what ſayes that devine man Saint Ambroſe,
Deles picturam Dei mulier, ſi vultum tuum
Materiali candore obliniſti. Againe, Saint Cyprian
with the reſt of theſe learned and devout Fathers,
ſayes, Foeminae manus Deo inferunt, quando illud
quod ille formauit reformare contendunt. How deteſtable
a thing is it to ſee a filthie creature ſeeke to
reforme the handy-worke of God: how vnthankfull
and ingrate art thou to thy Creator, when thou
ſeeſt the blinde, the cripple, or any ſtrucken with
Gods hand? how ſhouldſt thou thanke God, who
hath created thee with all the joynts of thy bodie
ſtretcht and even, and hath given thee all thy right
members, he might haue made thee a monſter to
the world: But O! thy pride conſiders not this: but
thou with Art will correct the wondrous works of
God: O come è indegna è ſtomacheuole coſa il vederte
talhor, con vn pinello pinger le guance &amp; occultar le
mende di natura è del tempo, è veder Come il liuido
pallor fai parer di ostro, Le rughe apiani è il bruno imbianchi
è togli col defetto il defetto. All their inventions,
their ever-deviſing conceites, are naught elſe
but ſnares to entrap our owne ſoules: the man
with enticing vanities, doeth allure and perſwade
the women, and the women with ſuperſtitious
and ſuperfluous follies, tempts the man, and yet
for all this, there is manie women (no doubt,

who meanes well) are deceaved with the ſubtill deceites
of falſe and perjured men: they will make
their owne ſex by an inſtrument to overthrowe
them, when a woman will for gold or mony tempt
another woman, and vſe all deceaving tricks to enſnarcher:
ſo I ſay, a woman to a woman is a great
enemie; ſuch Pandroſſes cares not the wrack of
young damoſels, and then the diſtreſſed woman
becomes an out-caſt to her friends, aſhamed of
themſelues, and a ſlaue to all kinde of miſerie. But
can ſuch ſort of women be excuſed, who deſiring
to be deceaved, will compound and yeeld vpon
reaſonable conditions. This ſort of women are the
weaker veſſels, who imputes their wantonnes to
their too-much weaknes, and whoſe naturall infirmities
muſt be excuſed with their ſimple ignorance,
who truſted ſo much to oathes and vowes.
O God, was ever man bewitched to think that the
conques of a woman can crowne honor: or can it
raiſe any Trophies to vertues victorie: or was ever the
ſtealing of a Maids virginitie regiſtred in any chronicle
for a valorous act of worth, and being got,
what is it? A haſtie-paſt-pleaſure, with a ſpeedie
following repentance, where a ſwarme of tortring
thoughts ſtill works, a ſwift revenge, a trifling toy,
and like a feather blowen with the winde before
children, for when one boy gets it, hee opens his
hand to ſee it, thē the wind blowes it ſtraight away
againe, then others runs and gets it againe, againe,
and againe, and ſo it goes ſtill from hand to hand.
And whats all this they runne for, it is but a feather,

let it goe, Who builds his hopes vpon the ruenous ground
of a wauering womans Conſtancie, ſhall haue a ſuddaine
fall: And well may he with a pare of croſſed armes
breath forth and ſay,
            Donna adorata, e, vn nume del inferno.
            
               IF haples I, had harbord in my heart
               The feſtred ſting of euer-tortring greefe,
               Reuthles diſdaine had neuer ſcornd my ſmart,
               Nor I haue baiſde my ſelfe to beg releefe:
               But O, my Miſtres, hath a womans minde,
               Who loues her beſt, there proues ſhe moſt vnkinde.
            
            
               Doe what ſhe can, O cruell faithles faire,
               Be ſtill ingrate, and neuer grant me grace:
               For why? the proud triumph of my Deſpare
               Hath lade my hopes before her ſlaughtring face:
               There muſt they ſterue, murthred with miſ-regarde,
               My Loue is loath'd, and I haue no rewarde.
            
            
               Then fare-well Loue, a woman is a toy,
               Which being got, ſome other gets againe:
               Curſt be that man, whoſe jelouſie is joy,
               And yeelds him ſeruile to a Sluaiſh paine:
               Who courts a woman, muſt not thinke it ſtrange,
               That want of wit, ſtill makes her minde to change.
            
            
               O man whom GOD his cheefeſt wonder made,
               And Treaſure ritch of his al-ſeeing Eye,
               The winter blaſt, thy flooriſh fare ſhall fade:
               Swift-poſting-time, ſtill tels thee you muſt dye:
               
                  
In fanſies lap ſpend not thy dayes for ſhame,
               Go ſpend thy dayes where honour liues with fame.
            
            
               Then get you gone, ſweet Syrins of deceat,
               Full well I knowe your ſtrange inchanting skill:
               I ſcorne that Coward of a baſe conceat,
               That Pandor-like waits on a womans will:
               O let him dye deceaud, that will not doubt you,
               And happieſt he, who beſt can liue without you.
            
            When a man hyreth an horſe, either to ryde
Poſt or Journey, as it pleaſes the ryder, at his journeies
end he receaues but a hyrelings pay, and ſo he
is preſently gone. But when a man hes an horſe of
his own, he will haue a care of him, and ſpare for no
expenſes to ſee him well furniſhed, well fed, and
well dicht, neither will he burſt him, nor ſpur-gall
him, but he will ryde him ſoftly and ſpare him.
Now what if his horſe ſhould learne gades, and doe
nothing without the Baſtenado, kick with his feete,
and not be anſwerable to the Rainzie, but muſt be
ridden with a French bit; in faith then I think that
man had better ridden on a Caronze hyrling, when
his owne horſe proves noght elſe but a wearied jad.
If a man could ſay this word My owne, he were happy
ſo being he could ſay it with contentment, as
my owne houſe, my owne wyfe, my owne children;1. Cor. 7. cap.
is it not written, Let euery man haue his owne
wife. But now in theſe dayes, ſuch is the deteſtable
abhominations cropen into the hearts of men,
which makes them to polut the ſacred band of Matremonie.
               
Now in this godles tyme a man cares not
to put away his own wyfe, and take another; he wil
alledge a thouſand lyes, he will corrupt men and
wemen to beare falſe witnes, or elſe he is not aſhamed
to diſcover his owne filthines, and take the
fault on himſelfe,Mark. 10. cap. 
               What God hath coupled together, let
no man ſeparate.
               Luk. 16. cap. And againe, our Saviour ſayes,
VVhoſoeuer ſhall put away his owne wife, and maries with
another, committeth adultery: And if a woman put away,
or deuorſe her ſelfe from her owne husband, committed
adultery, incaſe ſhe marie with any other man. Said
not the man to the woman at their firſt Creation,
This is now bone of my bones,
               Gen. 2. cap. 
               and fleſhe of my fleſhe, and
for that cauſe ſhe ſhall be called woman. And againe S.
Paul ſpeaking of the loue ſhould be betwix the wife
and the husband, and what authority he hath over
his wife, he ſayeth,Cor. 11. cap. 
               The man is not of the woman, but
the woman of the man, for the man was not created for
the womans ſake, but the woman for the mans ſake. And
why then ſhould a man hate his owne fleſh and
bones. Why ſhould not a wel-deſerving wife be
well cheriſhed, and aboue all things, moſt reſpected,
as his ſecond-ſelf, yea, even all in al as himſelf.
But many men are to blame, who maries a woman,
and preſently after he is maried, goeth to farre
Countries, and longſome journeyes, and lives her
to the mercy of all miſery, it is a great ſigne and token
that this man whatſomever, hes neither reſpect
to GOD nor ſhame of the world, and he is a Rebel
to the command of GOD,Deu. 24. cap. 
               When a man taketh a new
wife, he ſhall not goe a warfare, neither ſhall he be charged

with any buſsineſſe, but he ſhall be free, and remaine at
home one yeare, and rejoyce with his wyfe. It were
better never to marie, then to mary and abuſe Mariage.
But the originall of this miſcheef proceeds
partely of Parents, and partely of the parties themſelues,
whoſe avarice and gread of geare is ſuch,
that they care not whom with they joyne, ſo being
they be ritch; they looke not to education, to qualaties,
not birth, ritches hides all imperfections,
and what followes, noght elſe but hatred, greefe, a
languiſhing repentance, a mutuall contempt, a
continuall battell, and a loathſome bed when daies
of anger, and nights of ſorrow, are waited-on, with
Argus-eid jelouſy. The wiſe man ſaith in his Canticles
Ielouſie is cruell as the graue,
               cap. 8. 
               and the coles thereof are fyrie,
and coles of a vehement flame. And the Italian making
a deſcription of jelouſie, he crieth out, with a
vehement paſſion, Da quell ſoſpetto rio, da quell timore,
da quell Martir, da quella freneſia, da quella rabia detta
geleſia. How many are they who are robd both of
ſhame and honour, yeelding to inſatiable luſt, no
reſtraint, nor yet ſetting limits to modeſty, but gives
their own deſire fre ſcope to a more then beaſtly
appatyte, intertainde with all kinde of delicat allurements,
that their filthy fleſh may ever be craving,
and the better furniſhed with that conſuming
pleaſure. And again, when ſome ſhameles creatures
makes their body the moving ſtage of licherous ſin,
where all the fates of activaty, and walting trickes
giues a generall tryall in a particular forme; when
baſe bloud corrupts Nobility, &amp; makes wrongous

heires poſſeſſe other mens lands, when voluntarie
ignorance becomes a Nurſe to vnlawfull children:
And when the ſacred vowe of Matrimonie is made
a jugling maske to overſyle the eies of true ſimpliſetie:
The wrongde Spaniard cryde out, De la
mala muger te guarda, y de la buena no fies nada. Alas,
poore horned bucks, whilſt they judge charetably
and makes their fooliſh ignorance impute all to a
kinde courtaſie, which brings nothing with it but
an homely honeſtie, even then is leaſt miſdeming
mindes made a mocking ſtock to ſecret villany, and
if the partie (who is wrongde) appeare to miſconſter
any thing, or to ſmell knavery, then preſently is
there a complementing application of borrowed
imbracements accompaned with vrged teares,
fained kiſſes, falſe perjuries, flatring ſpeaches, with
broken vowes, and a number of vnperformde proteſtations.
All this villanous diſſimulation hoodwinks
verity, &amp; maks one become the pointed-outſport
of anothers pleaſure, one beat the buſh whilſt
others catch the bird, and the righteous owner feed
on idle ſhowes, whilſt ſtrangers injoies the true ſubſtance.
This tricking Humor takes both cheſſes and
belles from many a one, &amp; ſends them to the Rangild.Prov. cap. 5.
But heare what opinion the word of GOD
hath of ſuch, The lippes of a ſtrange woman drop as a honey
combe, and her mouth is more ſoft then Oyle, but the
end of her is more bitter then wormewod, and more ſharpe
then a two edged ſword. And againe to that ſame purpoſe,
Then why ſhuld thou delite, my ſon, in a ſtrange woman,
or imbrace the boſome of a ſtrāger? With what eies

can thou looke vpon thine own wife when thou giueſt
thy bodie to another woman; is not her face a
booke that vnfolds a volume of accuſations to thy
ſpotted ſoule: Is not the Echo of theſe words, I
take thee before God, ſtill ſounding through the corners
of thy Conſcience, tooke thou not her to thy
wyfe? did thou not vowe before GOD and the
world, to keep thy body cleane onely for her. Why
ſhould thou then imbrace the boſome of a ſtrange woman.
And heere againe what deſcription the word of
GOD maketh of an Harlot, and how it paints forth
the filthineſſe of a ſhameles woman, And I ſaw among
the fooles,
               Prover. cap. 7. 
               and conſidered among the children, a
young man deſtitute of vnderſtanding, And behold there
met him a woman with an harlots behauiour, and ſubtle
in heart, ſo ſhe tooke him, and kiſſed him, and with an
impudent face ſaid vnto him, I haue peace offrings, this
day haue I payde my vowes, therefore came I forth to
meete thee, that I might ſeeke thy face, and now I haue
found thee, I haue deckt my bed with ornaments, Carpits,
Laces of Aegipt, I haue perfumde my bed with Mirrh,
Aloes, and Cynamon, Come let vs take our fill of loue till
the morning, let vs take our pleaſure in dalliance, for my
husband is not at home, he is gone a journey, farre off,
and he followed her ſtraight wayes, like an Ox that goeth
to the ſlaughter. The pryce of ſuch pleaſures are
great, and ever brings with it a ſwift repentance,
and the end of it is noght elſe but Miſery, Povertie,
ſhame and Beggery. O what pleaſure is it to ſee the
man &amp; the woman both of one minde, comporting
with others imperfections, and ſtill yeelding to others

waiknes, El conſejo de la muger es pocoy quien no
le toma es loco, When a modeſt diſcretion, and ſilent
patience is applyde to their owne infirmities;
for when the woman is in rage and ſtormes at her
houſhald affaires, correcting wrongs with the furious
rage of her tongue. O then the man ſhould
labor to pacifie her with ſweete words, gentle admonitions,
and large promiſes. Is it not a common
Proverb, that wyles helps wake folke. And when the
man is in rage, the woman ſhould not then tempt
his patience, but holde her peace, and with loving
words, obedient duety, and all kinde of courtaſie
carres him, and be quiet.1. Tim. 2. cap. Saieth not S. Paul, I permit
not a woman to vſurpe authoritie ouer the man, but to be
in ſilence. This is the true duety of a woman towards
her husband, and this woman is the woman
of wiſdome, as it is written, A peaceable woman, and
of a good heart,
               Eccl. 26. cap. 
               is the gift of the Lord, and there is nothing
ſo much worth as a woman well inſtructed, this is great
ritches, and a ritch treaſure. This woman bringes
peace with her, ſhe hes a carefull deſire, and an earneſt
loue towardes her husband, and diſcharges an
vpright duetie to her children, with many eyes
watchfull over her houſe. And what is ſuch a woman
worth? The Scripture tels thee, That her pryce
is far aboue the pearles, the heart of her husband truſteth
in her, and he ſhall haue no need of ſpoyle, ſhe will doe him
good and not euill all the dayes of her life, ſhe ſeketh wooll
and flax, and laboreth cheerfully with her hands. This is
the woman whoſe eares doeth not itch for ſtrange
teddings, nor is ſhe curious to ſearch ſecreets of

others affaires, nor yet goes ſhe abroad to ſeeke
newes, nor hes ſhe any diſeaſe to be curde with the
aire taking, ſhe breeds not her childe with the languiſhing
diſeaſe of a new faſhiond gowne, nor yet
needs ſhe any molefying Ceir-cloath to be lade at
her ſtomack, becauſe ſhe can not get her will, her
domeſtick affairs is a pleaſant paſtime, which brings
profiet by the purches of her own hands, She putteth
her hands to the whele, and her hands handle the ſpindle,
ſhe is it not afraide nor aſhamed to fyle her fingers
for the well of her family, and ſo by her handy-labor
helps to ſuſtaine them, Her husband is knowne in
the gates, when he ſitteth with the Elders of the land, ſhe
hath a care to ſee him civill, in all things his honour
is her glory, ſhe is not a pratler, but ſhe openeth her
mouth with wiſdome, and law of grace is in her tongne,
ſhe over-ſeeth the wayes of her houſhould, and eateth not
the bread of idleneſſe: her children ryſe vp and call her
bleſſed, her husband alſo ſhall praiſe her. O what a
world of happines liueth that man and woman in
where mutual concotde, peace and quietneſſe, true
tranquillity of minde triumphs, wher external diſſimulation
is not aplyde to cover the inwarde deceit
of the heart, and where a modeſt diſcretion excuſes
and dantons the fleſhly deſire of inſatiable luſt.
This may be called felicitie. All their prayers are
acceptable to GOD, what they pretend is proſperous,
becauſe all their actions feares the Lord,
it is onely to ſuch as theſe that GOD will keepe
his promiſe, ſpoken by the mouth of Dauid the
Prophet, He hath giuen a portion vnto them that feare

him, he will euer be mindefull of his Covenant. And
what is it? Even this, Thy wyfe ſhall be as the fruitefull
wynes on the ſides of thine houſe, and thy Children
lyke the Oliue plants round about thy table, thus are
they bleſſed that feareth GOD. For all theſe kynde
promiſes and large bleſſinges beſtowed on mankinde.
Yet there are many men and women whom
God hath bleſſed with children, who are vnworthy
&amp; vnnatural Parents, they are careles, of their childrens
education, and cares not what becomes of
them; how far is it againſt Nature to ſee a woman
cary the Infant in her belly nyne Moneths; and
that whyle vexed with ſo many ſundry ſorts of intollerable
paines, and when ſhe approches neere
the delivery of her birth, what a feare and terror
will poſſes all the parts of her bodie? what pittifull
exclamations will ſhe make through her grieuous
tortour? what an extreame agony and perrell of her
lyfe will ſhe be in, before the Childe parte from
her belly? This is a great and ſtupendeous miracle
of Nature, ordained by GOD Almighty, and
for all theſe torments, greefes, and vexations, ſome
vnnaturall mothers will forget their children, ſhe
will be ſo delicate, ſhe will not nouriſh them,
nor fyle her fine cloathes with ſlobbring younglings,
ſhe muſt haue a ſtranger to nource her childe,
for the bewtie of her ſnowe-white skinne muſt
not be blabered with ſucklings. It appeares very
well, that theſe ſorte of women gettes and ingenders
their children onely for pleaſures ſake, and
delivers them to the worlde for meere neceſſitie,

to empty their wombe. Again when they come
to perfite yeares, ſome Parents will giue over their
children to all kinde of miſery. When GOD in his
ſuper-aboundant mercy ſpeakes to Sion be his Prophet,
he ſaieth,Eſay. 49 cap. 
               Can the mother forget her owne infant,
or can ſhe not be mercifull to the childe of her own wombe,
if ſhe could be forgetfull, yet I will not forget thee, nor can
I reject thee, for beholde I haue written thee in the fleſhe
of my owne hands. In this compariſon our GOD
ſhowes how farre it goeth beyond all naturall reaſon
that the Parents ſhould forget their children.
But there are many children who deſerueth the
wrath of their Parents, through their owne ingratitude,
and through their great over-ſight of duety,
Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy dayes may
be long in the land which the Lord thy God hath giuen
thee. Let ingratfull children goe look on that wondrous
worke of Nature, and of Loue; the young
Cigonz
                     •
                  is will vomet vp their meate from their ſtomach
to nuriſch their parens, when they are oulde
and can not flee. Looke to all beaſts by Nature,
what loue they cary one to another, &amp; what mutuall
concord in their owne kinde; and how much
more ought reaſonable creatures, the Parents to
the children, and the children to the Parents: Ye
Parents (ſaieth S. Paul) prouoke not your children to
wrath: Meaning be over great auſteirnes, when
Parents and Children liues all in peace and quyetnes,
and in charitable concord. O how good a thing
is it (ſaieth the Scripture) and how joyfull is it, to
ſee brethren and ſiſters, and the whole family to liue
in

loue and peace, they eate their bread with ſweete
contentment, and ſpends their dayes in great happines.
But woe be to ſeditious tail-tellers, to leying
lippes, to harkners and rounders, to back-byters
and ſlanderers, who are ſowers of diſſention, and
with their wicked and malitious tongues, are inventers
of miſcheif: The wiſdome of GOD ſaith,
A wicked perſon ſoweth ſtrife, and a tail-teller maketh
diſſention. It is vpon ſuch wicked inſtruments that
the great GOD hath promeſt to raine fire and brimſtone,
with ſtormie tempeſts: this ſhall be the portion
of their cup, with many more greevous and endleſſe
torments, which are provided for detracters
and ſlanderers.Iam. 3 Epiſt. 
               All beaſtes are tamde be man, but the
tongue no man can tame, it is an vnruely euill, full of deadly
poyſone. Contentment is great wealth, and ſobreatie
with loue, is better then Kingdomes with
ſtrife,Eccl. 25 cap. 
               I had rather dwell with a Lion, then keepe houſe
with a wicked wife. And againe ſaith the Scripture,
A wicked wife maketh a ſory heart, an heauy countenance,
and a wounded minde, wake hands, and feeble knees, and
can not comfort her husband in hauines. Can any goe
more neere the husband then the wife? are they not
both one fleſh? But ſuch is the wake fragility of our
wicked nature, that even they who lieth in others
boſomes ſome-time will diſcord; but the diſcord
amongſt friends ſhould be ſhort, as betwix the Parents
and the Children, betwix Brether and Siſters,
and cheefly betwix the Man and the Wife;
Is it not written, Let not the Sunne goe downe vpon your
anger: The anger of ſome wemen are dangerous.

the wiſe and learned man Auſonius ſpeaking of a
womans anger, he ſaieth, That the wylde Boare perſewed
of dogs, the Viper whoſe taile is tread vpon, the Lyons
bitten with hunger, the Tiger robd of her young-ones,
are not more cruell and fearce then an angry woman.
               Eccl. 42 cap. 
               Melior
eſt iniquitas viri, quam mulier benefaciens. There
ſhould be no vp-caſts betwixt the man and the woman,
as to ſay, thou art come of this, or of that, we
are all the children of Adam, and alſo what ever ſecretes
are amongſt them, ſhould not be reveild,
were the occaſion never ſo great. Many times great
miſchief hes bred of ſuch things, for this cauſe woman
ſhuld not be curious of the mans perticular affairs.Iudges. 14. cap.
               Sampſon being maried with the vncircumciſed
Philiſtanes, his wife did never reſt, but importuned
him to knowe his ſecrets, and then ſhe reveiled all
to his great harme. The wiſe man Salomon ſayeth,
A vertuous woman is the crowne of her husband,
               Pro. 12. cap. 
               but ſhe
that maketh him aſhamed, is as corruption in his bones.
But many times it falles out, that the man is author
of his ſhame, blowing and ſounding abroad the
Trumpet of his owne ignomy; in this reſpect, that
when he knoweth a particular imperfection to predominat
in his wife, he will not be ſecrete, but
makes the world pointe their fingers at his turpritude;
when he is to come home, he ſhould ſend
word before, and tell he comes, and if his minde aſſure
him that Occupata ela ſtanza, then ſhould he be
very ware to enter his houſe vpon a ſuddainty, leaſt
he catch a moat in his eye, and then his eie-ſore
will ſting his heart with impatience, turning all

the miſty-clouds of his darke doubts, in a clear-ſhining
verity, it will bring Jelouſie to a true and perfite
reſolution, it will giue him poſſeſſion of Hornes,
and ſo by this meanes, it inrolles him amongſt the
Cathegory of voluntary Cuck-colds, then muſt he
maintaine a back-dore for the ingreſſe and egreſſe of
his wifes vulgare actions. A ſentenall muſt haue a
good eare, a quick eie, and a ſwift retreat, that the
al'arme may be the more tymous, and to make a
more large preparation for Patience. O what a
ſpatious ſubject is this, and how endleſſe appeares
this profound diſcourſe, like a ſtranger Pilgrim in
a wilderneſſe, J haue loſt my way; or like the Seafaring-man
fatigated in a longſome voyage, ſounding
his lead where he findeth no ground, in ſuch
groundles deepes; then at laſt he returnes hopeles
to end his (ſeeming endleſſe) journey, with a diſſembling
courage, and a heartles cry, he comforts
his company. So (good Reader) I am forced heere
obruptly to break off, for ſo long as this Subject is
the load-ſtar of my diſcourſe, I think, and am aſſured
that my Ship ſhall never arryue to the ſight of
Capa dell buena aſperanza. Then in deſpaire I bid this
large Ocaean fare-well, for this fearfull, and tempeſtuous
ſtorme threatens Ship-wrack, I muſt ſtand
by my Taik-ling, ſhut my Rudder a lee, and ſeeke
vp for the next ſhoare.
            
               Away vaine world, thou Oaecan of annoyes,
               And welcome Heauen with thy eternall joyes.
            
            
               
O How farre (beholde) doeth it goe beyond
the reatch of mans capacitie to ponder the
great and wondrous workes of GOD,
when we meditate vpon his miracles, to ſee the
frame of every thing, preſenting ſuch ſtrange objects,
this large proſpect of Heaven and Earth, the
admirable operations of every thing which hath
bene wroght, and ſtill works in the ſwift courſe of
time; and when we haue conſidered all that we
can, or may, we ſhall ſee that mankinde of all other
creatures, are moſt ingrate to his Creator. So that
this great and vniverſall Glob, whoſe ſpatious
ſhoulders is over-lodned with the wickedneſſe of
mankinde, and wearied with the heavy burthen of
weghtie ſinne, and the vnnaturall ſtrife in all
kinde of eſtates, even from the ritch Monarch to
the poore begger. We may ſee Kings oppoſde againſt
Kings, theſe great and earthly powers triumph
in other mens ſpoyle, we may ſee mightie
ruelars vſurpe Kingdomes, ſubjects mutein againſt
their owne naturall Prince, contemne his Laws, &amp;
in ſpight of GOD, oppreſſe the poore, and turne
careles Rannegats to all Chriſtianity, Virum ſanguinum
&amp; doloſum abhominabitur Dominus, GOD abhors
and deteſts the bloudy and malitioue man, he
ſhall never get mercy, all his abhominations ſhall
not leaue him, but ſhall follow him and accuſe him,
his ambition, and the complaints of the oppreſſed,
ſhall condemne his Soule. And what is all this
world, it is noght elſe but a ſtage where euery one
acts their parte, and then makes an eternall retret

without returne, Heavens incloſtred powers looks
downe, and they ſee all the dulfull Tragedies of vnrecalled
time, and marks the vnſpeakable wickedneſſe
of mankinde, how many folies are acted vpon
this ſtage, for the moſt parte playes the Buffone, and
all their life is but a pleaſant Comedy, and with the
Ethnick they cry out, Ede, bibe, dorme, poſt Mortem,
nulla voluptas. Vpon the other parte we may beholde
the picture of true repentance, painted with
ten thouſand miſeries, the pittifull geſture of men,
how vnlawfull Law hes made miſerable, the beggerd
Marchant, who hath bankerd-out his credit:
the Artiſan whom age and ſicknes brings to poverty,
and we may ſee how the threed-bare Cationer
goeth with melancholious grones, diſperſing
the ſighs of his greeved minde in the Aire: we may
ſee how the curious Alchamiſt in ſeeking the Philoſopher-ſtone,
with continuall travell, and far-ſoght
inventions hath wrung out all the ſubſtance of his
wits, and ſeeking to finde wealth, hath loſt all his
wealth, ſo till at laſt, his ſweating labors, rypes nothing
elſe but ſmooke. O then, his repentance beginnes
to challenge time, when all his ſmooking
hopes are vaniſhed in the aire, in end, he payeth his
debt to Death, and dyeth a begger. And we may
ſee the Necromancer, one who hath ſtudied the black
Art, for a little borrowed (and yet a very vncertaine)
tyme dambs his owne ſoule, and giues it as
a proper tribute to Hell, and why? becauſe with
the Arch-deuils direction, he will command all the
infernall ſpirits. O moſt vaine illuſion, and deceatfull

pleaſure which brings nothing with it, but eternall
horror. Now when all men hath acted their
parte vpon this vniverſall ſtage, then comes Alcommanding
Death, &amp; ſwiftly cryes to every one,
Away gette you gone, your parte is playde. So with his
Imperiall Darte, he ſtreaketh all kinde of Creatures
without reſpect, and then with his reuthles
hand, he draweth the darke Courtaine of the
Graue, over the paill bodie of mankinde. So ſhall
thy ſoule compeare before the Great Spectator of
Heaven, who hath ſeene all thy actions, and how
thou haſt plaide thy parte in this world, there the
booke is opened where all thy doings are in Regiſter,
if they be vpright, then art thou crowned
in the Majeſticall Throne of Eternall Glory; if
thy actions and doinges be falſe, and found deceatfull,
if thou haſt ſtopped thy eares, and woulde
not hearken,Reuel. 20. cap. nor heare vnto the voice of Gods
Meſſingers, then ſhall thy name be blotted and
ſcraped out of the Booke of lyfe, and thy ſoule and
bodie ſhall be condemned to burne perpetuallie in
the Everlaſting fyre of Hel. O what a pittifull thing
is it to ſee ſo many catiue creatures careles of the
life to come, and what great debt they take on their
ſoule to be payed at the letter day. The wicked abhominations
of mans heart made GOD in his
great wrath,Gen. 6. cap. Cry out and ſay, I repent that ever I
made man. And why did our Saviour Chriſt hate this
world, he telleth the reaſon, Quia mundus totus in maligno
poſitus eſt. Becauſe the Worlde altogether is
placed in wickedneſſe. For we may beholde, what

wickednes poſſeſſes mankinde, even from their verie
youth-head? of what evill inclination? how perverſe
in their actions? and how contemptious to
age? how will they mock, ſcorne, and diſdaine the
reverend Father, and the aged Matrone. O ſayes
the word of God,Pro. 16. Cap. 
               Age is the crowne of glory, therefore
we ſhould honour age, helpe and reverence age,
the pernitious nature of man is ſuch, that it breeds
contention, emulation, and continuall diſcords,
how vncharitable without law, reaſon, or religion,
ſo that man to man are the moſt cruell enemies
of any other creatures: when the Neronicall heart
of man being in a tirannicall humor, what kinde of
ſtrange tortures will they deviſe one againſt another?
how vnnaturall is this? and how farre is it againſt
all Chriſtianitie? it hath kindled the wrath
of the Almightie, when anger calleth Iſraell, Gentem
apoſtatricem dura facie &amp; indomabili corde, an apoſtaticall
Nation with a ſhameleſſe face &amp; encourageable
heart, who will not acknowledge the wondrous
mercies of our loving God, Miſeros facit populos
peccatum ſinne maketh people miſerable, and
when holy Iob ſpeaking of wicked men and of careleſſe
ſinners, he ſayeth, Bibit quaſi aquam iniquitatem,
they drink vp ſinne like water, even like a thirſtie
ſtomack, with as little care and as much pleaſure
drinke they vp wickednes, and that thou who
readeſt this, may the better beleeue me: goe and
with experience thou ſhalt ſee (goe I ſay) &amp; walke
abroad into the ſtreetes, and behold the doings of
mankinde; looke and marke well their behaviour,

and faſhions, conſider well and attentiuely what is
done in Market-places, in Kings Courts, in Juſtice
houſes, in common meeting places, what lying,
&amp; deceaving? what ſlander &amp; ſhameleſſe villany?
thou ſhalt ſee nothing in this world ſo little accounted
of as ſinne, thou ſhalt ſee Juſtice corrupted with
briberie, and variety ſold for money, and impudent
faces deſpiſe equity, thou ſhalt ſee the innocent cō
               demned,
the wicked and malitious malefactor delivered
and ſet free, the villaine advanced, &amp; the vertuous
deſpiſed, thou ſhalt ſee the proud oppreſſour
triumph, &amp; theeues command, vſurers and Brokers
deceaving their neighbours, extortioners at liberty
to execute their owne deſires: and thou ſhalt ſee
ignorant fooles preferred to great authority, becauſe
they are ritch, worthleſſe men reverenced, honored,
and drawen vp to great dignities, and thou
ſhalt ſee how the eager deſire of ambition cuts innocent
throats, treaſon covered and cloaked with
flattery: and to conclude, thou ſhalt heare the general
voyce of the people, to be nothing elſe but of
vanities, bawdrie, and whoring, detraction &amp; backbiting,
pride, envie, deceit, drunkennes, diſſimulation,
wantonnes, diſſolation, flatterie, lying, ſwearing,
perjuring, &amp; blaſpheming. And ſo this ſhal cōfirme
(that in their perrillous and latter dayes) how miſchief
abounds, &amp; what abominations are ſpred on
the face of the earth, having no regard to law or juſtice,
to reaſon nor religion, but in an vnſatiable appetite
of beaſtlineſſe, are become drunk with ſinne:
how glad may the man of an vpright mind be? how

quiet may his ſoule be? at what ſweet repoſe may
his conſcience be? when all his actions are vpright
before GOD:Pro. 15. cap. the Scripture ſayes, Secura
mens juge conuiuium, a ſecure conſcience is a blithe
banquet: but O thou wicked man! O thou malitious
oppreſſour! O thou deceitfull and avaritious
villaine: how ſhalt thou haue thy ſoule and conſcience
tortured? the terrour of thy vnrighteouſneſſe
ſhall torment thee, thy nights ſhall be voyde
of reſt, and thy ſoule ſhall be wrapped vp in the
pricking thornes of thy owne wickedneſſe, everie
thing ſhall affray thee, all objects ſhall threaten
thee, and reſtleſſe deſpaire ſhall hant thee with ten
thouſand devilliſh temptations:Pro. 28. cap. 
               Salomon ſayes, the
wicked man flieth though no man purſue him: Hee will
ſtart at his owne ſhadow, the heart of him is alwaies
aloft, Conſcientia mille testes: O but heare in the end
what is prepared for ſuch wicked and inſolent ſinners
(who hath ſuch pleaſure in this world, &amp; with
their abhominations procures the heavie wrath of
God) even this is prepared for them, Cruciabuntur in
ſaecula ſaeculorum in ſtagno ardente igne &amp; ſulphure, they
ſhal be tormented for ever &amp; ever in a burning lake
of fire &amp; brimſton. O that the horror of this ſētence
might make vs mark our owne blindnes, and amend
our beaſtly life, Nol ti fieri ſicut equus et mulus quibus
non eſt intellectus: Be not like the horſe or the Mule,
which hath no vnderſtāding, as the Prophet would
ſay, be not ſo brutiſh nor ſo voyd of reaſon, nor yet
ſet not thy ſaluation to ſuch a ſmall reckoning. O
thou reader, I will requeſt thee, &amp; all mankind ever

to remember and hold this moſt worthy and infallible
ſentence printed in thy heart, Hoc momentum
vnde pendit aeternitas, This ſhort life is the very moment,
whereon dependeth all eternitie either the
eternall joyes of heaven, or elſe the eternall paines
of hell. O J ſay againe, remember this true ſentence,
and haue a continuall care of this moment,
and ſpend it not in ſuch idle vanities,Math. 5. Cap. 
               Agree with
thine aduerſarie quickly, whiles thou art in the way going
with him, leaſt thine aduerſarie deliuer thee to the Iudge,
and the Iudge deliuer thee to the jaylor, and the jaylor caſt
thee in priſon, where thou ſhalt not come out till thou
haue payed all. How carefull ſhould we be in this
little moment of our life, to prevent the intollerable
and endleſſe burning paines of hell. What
would the damned ſoules in hell doe, if they were
in this world againe? how would they ſpend this
moment, to eſcape that vnſpeakable torture, that
ever-burning Gehenna, where nothing elſe is but
goaſhing of teeth and everlaſting horrour, yea, and
worſe than the tongue or heart of man can tell or
thinke, out of the which part there is no redemption.
Good Chriſtian Reader, againe I will requeſt
thee, and all ſinners, to print this in the depth of thy
heart: And I my ſelfe, I confeſſe to be a moſt greevous
ſinner, when I thinke vpon the loſſe of pretious
time, it ſhrills my wearie ſoule with griefe, it
wearies my dayes, and diſturbs my reſt: with that
holy Prophet Dauid, I crie to God with a repenting
heart: O Lord, remember not the ſinnes of my youth,
nor my ignorance, but according to thy great mercies remember

thou me, euen for thy goodnes ſake, O Lord:
The workes of our Lord God are great and wondrous,
they are incomprehenſible, and yet his mercies
exceedes all his ſtupendious workes, therefore
once more let vs conſider ſo neere as wee can the
great works of God, the creating of all things. The
heauens (ſayes the Prophet Dauid) ſets forth his glory,
and the firmament ſhewes the workes of his hands: The
earth, the ſeas, and all living creatures therein, the
ſtrange courſe of every thing in heaven in earth, &amp;
the naturall inclination of all living creatures. Look
on the ſeas how they are limited, that they ſhall not
paſſe their bounds, but keepes their due courſe:
Looke on the creation of mankinde, he hath made
vs according to his owne image, and of the verie
dirt and ſlime of the earth hath he created and formed
vs, he hath alſo made vs ſubject to many infirmities
of Nature, the filthineſſe of our fleſh, the excrementall
corruption of many ſundry and ſtrange
diſeaſes, which are naturall, and inſident both to
man and woman: And what would this carcaſe of
ours be, if it had not the change of cleane cloathes?
it would be naught elſe but a maſſe of vermine, and
with time the ſmell of our fleſh would be loathſom,
and ſo in the end wee would putrifie and conſume
to naught. O man, why is all this done? onely to
baſe our pride, and God hath done it to let vs ſee
what ſtuffe wee are made of: and what bath our
good God done more? Within this earthly veſſell
of our body, he hath placed a ſoule made of a devine
and heavenly ſubſtance, adorned with all her

faculties, and garniſhed with reaſon: The Prophet
Dauid ſayes,Hebr. 2. Cap. 
               Little inferiour to the Angels. And beſides
all this, he hath caſt vnder our feete all kinde
of other creatures,Gen. 1. cap. and aboue all his workes that
work of vdſpeakable loue, that miraculous worke
of our redemption, and yet the mercie of our Lord
God goes farre aboue, and farre exceedes all his
wondrous works: for the holy Prophet Dauid ſayes,
The Lord is good and kinde to all, and his mercies are aboue
all his great and wondrous works, And heare what
our good &amp; loving God ſayes more with his owne
mouth:Eſay. 5. 4. 
               The mountaines ſhall remoue, the hills ſhall fall
downe, but my mercie ſhall not depart from thee: neither
ſhall I breake the couenant of my peace, ſaith the Lord,
that hath compaſsion on thee? What great and true
confidence may we then haue in Gods mercie? he
ſayes againe by the mouth of his Prophet:Eſay. 30. Cap. 
               The Lord
doth attend the ſinners conuerſion, to the end he may take
mercy on him, and thereby be exalted: Yet heare more
what God ſpeakes to Ezechiel the Prophet: Say vnto
them, as I liue, ſaith the Lord God, I deſire not the death
of the wicked,
               33. Cap. 
               but that the ſinner ſhould turn frō his ſinful
life &amp; liue: And farther, with what great cōpaſſion
goes he on to allure &amp; perſwade his people to convert:
O ſayes he, Turne you turne you from your wickednes,
for why will you periſh and die, O you houſe of Iſraell:
How many kind &amp; loving perſwaſions doth our loving
God giue vs to draw neere, and come home to
him. What gentle &amp; kind corrections? what large
and great ſpace of repentance? what wonderfull &amp;
ſweet Parables of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt in the

Evangell: Of the good ſheepheard who brought
back the ſheep vpon his ſhoulders, which had gone
aſtray, what joy and feaſting makes hee with his
friends, and of the honeſt woman when ſhee findes
her loſt peace of ſiluer. And the pittifull father with
teares of mercie &amp; compaſſion receaved his forlorn
ſonne, with what joy and gladnes did hee embrace
him. Here doth our ſweet Saviour Ieſus, ſhew what
great joy is in heaven at the convertion of a ſinner.
Our loving God again entring in more conference
with the ſinner, he begins to reaſon with him: Thou
ſayest that I am ritch,
               Reuel. S. Iohn. 3. Cap. 
               and encreaſed with goods, and full
of ſubſtance, and that I haue need of nothing, and doeſt
thou not know how poore thou art? how wretched? how
miſerable? how blinde? and how naked thou art? Then
our Saviour goes on with ſweet perſwading ſpeeches
to allure the ſinner, ſaying: I counſell thee to buy
of me gold, tried be the fire, that thou mayeſt be made
ritch, and white rayment, that thou mayeſt be cloathed,
and that thy filthie nakedneſſe may not be ſeene, and anoint
thine eyes with eye-ſalue, that thou mayeſt ſee: And when
he with chaines of loue keepes his owne faſt to him,
he ſayes, As many as I loue, I rebuke and chaſten, be zealous
therefore and amend. Now againe at laſt he concludes
with fervent compaſſion, Behold I ſtand at the
dore and knock, if any man heare my voice, and open the
dore, I will come in vnto him, and I will ſup with him,
and hee with mee. What more comfortable ſpeeches
would the heart of mankinde craue? or what
greater conſolation can wee Caitiue and diſtreſſed
ſinners deſire, who would refuſe to open

the dore of his heart to entertaine ſuch a worthie
gueſt of infinite loue and mercie, even Chriſt Jeſus
the onely ſonne of God omnipotent: he gaue his
life to ranſone the ſoules of ſinners, he left the glorious
heavens for our cauſe, and cloathed him ſelfe
with our wilde and filthy nature. Many yeeres did
he preach, he ſuffered cold, hunger, and reproach,
he was tempted, and faſted forty dayes in the wildernes,
in the agony of his Prayers, he ſweat bloud,
he was tortured, ſold, and impriſoned, his head was
crowned with ſharpe thornes, his body torne with
ſcourges, he was mocked, buffeted, and ſpet in the
face, his body hung on the Croſſe betwixt two
theeues, and his armes out-ſtretched, his hands and
feete peirced with nailes of iron, and his ſide and
heart wounded to death, neither was we bought
with ſiluer, gold, or pretious ſtones, but with the
infinite price of the bloud, and life of our Sauiour
Ieſus Christ, the onely ſonne of our ever-living
God. O it was our ſinnes and wickednes put him
to death, and laid all his cruell torments on him, it
was our wickednes made him faſt forty dayes when
he was tempted in the wildernes, we crowned his
Imperiall head with ſharpe thornes, we bound his
delicate armes with cords, wee mocked him, wee
ſtripped him naked, and ſcourged his bleſſed bodie,
we buffeted and ſpat in his moſt glorious face,
we laid the Croſſe on his patient ſhoulders, we caſt
lots for his vpper garments, we crucified him betwixt
theeues, and nailed his innocent hands and
feet to the Croſſe: it was for vs he ſweat bloud and

water in his prayers, and it was we, even onely we
who peirced and wounded his heart, and it was
wee who made him in his cruell paines of death,
cry out in his laſt paſſion, My God, my God, why haſt
thou forſaken me: All this, and much more hath our
wickednes done to the incomprehenſible Majeſtie
of almighty God. Heare with what great admiration
the Prophet Iſay cries out, ſpeaking of the Paſſion
of Jeſus Chriſt long before his comming:53. Cap. 
               Who
will (ſayes he) beleeue our report, and to whom is the
arme of the Lord reuealed? Then he begins and tells
of his ſufferings &amp; torments for our ſinnes, ſaying:
Surely he hath borne our infirmities, and caried our ſorrowee,
yet we did judge &amp; eſteeme him plagued, and ſmitten
of God, and humbled, but hee was wounded for our
traſgreſsions, it was for our iniquities he was puniſhed,
The burthen of our ſinnes was laide on his backe
like a ſimple ſheepe, ſo was he led to the ſlaughter,
in patient ſilence ſuffered he all ſorts of paines, neither
was wickednes with him, fraud nor deceit was
never found in his mouth: this Innocent was put
to death amongſt theeues and malefactors, for the
ſinnes of the world: The Evangeliſt S. Iohn ſayes,
For God ſo loued the world,
               3. Cap. 
               that he hath giuen his onely
begotten ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in
him, ſhould not periſh, but haue life euerlaſting. And
what ſhall this life everlaſting be? the Apoſtle tells
thee,1. Corin. 2. Cap. 
               That eye hath not ſeene, nor care hath not heard,
nor yet the heart of man can not imagine what happineſſe
and glory is prepared for them that ſhall be ſaued. Now
deere and loving Reader, conſider with what little

paines thou may (in this little moment of thy life)
prevent the everlaſting paines of hell, and make
conqueſt of the eternall glory of heaven, to ſee and
behold the vnſpeakable Majeſtie of God, ſet on his
triumphant Throne, evironed &amp; compaſt with the
glorified Saints, &amp; the innumerable Martirs, who
hath ſuffered for the faith of his ſonne Ieſus Christ,
when the woman in travaile and bitter paines of hir
birth is releeved of her naturall burthen: how will
the pleaſure of her child expell the paines, and giue
her comfort? Even ſo after the weariedneſſe of this
world,Iſay, 25. cap. the paines and anguiſh, then comes the joyfull
pleaſure of heavens, which expells all our vexations,Reuel. 7. cap.
comforts our ſoules, and wipes all the teares
from our eyes,Reuel. 21. cap. what perſecution? what croſſe or
worldly temptation ſhould hold or keepe vs backe
from ſuch an infinite treaſure, from ſuch an endleſſe
joy: Let vs ſay with that conſtant and bleſſed ſervant
of Jeſus Chriſt,Roma. 8. cap. 
               Who ſhal ſeparate vs from the loue
of Christ, ſhall tribulation, or anguiſh, or perſecution, or
famine, or nakednes, or perrill, or ſword, as it is written:
for thy ſake are wee killed all the day long, wee are
counted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter: neuertheleſſe in all
theſe things we are more then Conquerours, through him
that loued vs: for I am perſwaded that neither death nor
life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor
any other creature ſhall be able to ſeperate vs from the
loue of God, which is in Christ Ieſus our Lord. And a
little before, this happy and godly Apoſtle ſayes in
this ſame Chapter, For I count the afflictions of this

preſent life are not worthy of the glory which ſhall be
ſhowne to vs in the life to come: And for this reſpect,
When hee conſidered of the joy of heauen,
               Phil. 3. cap. 
               hee esteemed all
the ritches, all the glorie, and all the honour of this world,
but vayled filth and ſtinking dirt: How carefull then
ſhould wee be of this word Eternall? and that in
this moment wee ſhould be good proviſors: Our
Saviour deſires vs ſaying,Luk. 19. cap. 
               Negotiamini dum venio,
Be diligent, and lay much treaſure to thee fore againſt
I come, and ſeeke for a reckoning of thee:
For behold (ſayes he) I come quickly,
               Apoca. of S. Iohn 21. cap. 
               and my rewardis
with mee, to giue euery man according to his workes:
And what ſhall this reward be, if thou be vpright,
conſtant, and continue firme and faithfull to the
end,2. Cap. 
               Be thou faithfull vnto the death, and I will giue
thee the crowne of life, In hope of this glorious
Crowne, how gallantly ſhould thou fight againſt
all the wofull miſeries of this world, and ſtill contemne
all their earthly temptations: In the word
of GOD the wiſe man forwarnes the ſaying,
My ſonne, when thou art to come to the ſeruice of
GOD, ſtand fast in Iuſtice, and in feare, and prepare
thy minde for temptation. Heere thou art forwarned
in what eſtate thou ſhalt be in time of battell,
and howe to lye at thy guard againſt thy three
ghoſtlle enemies,Ephe. 5. cap. 
               The Deuill, the World, and the
Fleſh: Stand therefore, and your loynes girde about with
viritie, hauing on the breast-plate of righteouſneſſe.
What ſhould hinder vs to fight againſt our owne
infirmities, having ſuch a Captain to encourage vs,
and fight for vs, to ſtrengthen vs, to holde vs vp,

and helpe vs. Our Saviour ſayes, You are they who
haue ſtoode with me in my temptations, and therefore I
prepare for you a Kingdome. And I pray thee heare
good Keader what a Kingdome, even to be pertataker
of his owne glory, to ſit crowned with him in
all eternall joy and happineſſe, but our infirmities,
and weakneſſe, and want of faith, and our ſtrengthleſſe
hearts, and our great faintneſſe hath made our
Captaine Chriſt to ſay, You haue left me in time of
temptations: this lets vs ſee how feeble wee are of
our ſelues, and that without the helpe of God wee
are nothing, nor can doe nothing. Our omnipotent
God diminiſhed the Camp of Ierubaall, and with a
very ſmall number made him overcome the great &amp;
ſtrong armie of the Midianites,
               Iudg. 7. Cap. leaſt Ierubaall ſhould
haue ſaid, It is the ſtrength of man hath woone the
victorie, and ſo taken away the honor, glory, &amp; power
from God, Non nobis domine, non nobis ſed nomine
cuo da gloriam. O man, baſe thy pride, for of thy
ſelfe thou art naught elſe, but a miſerable and
ſtrengthleſſe worme, and all thy reſolutions are but
meere folly, for behold the fooliſh hearts, and thou
ſhalt ſee what courſe, and what ſtraunge decree
they will make to them ſelues. What vowes and
promiſes ſealed with oathes will they make to performe
wonders: but O let the fooliſh man heare
what the wiſedome of God ſayes,Prou. 19. cap. 
               Many deuiſes are
in a mans heart, but the counſell of the Lord God ſhall
ſtand: Thou mayeſt flatter thy ſelfe with many faire
promiſes, but all in vaine, becauſe God almightie
muſt be the chiefe actour of all things. This made

the Apoſtle Saint Paul ſay,Philip. 4. cap. 
               I am able to doe all things
through the helpe of Christ which ſtrengthneth me, and
when it pleaſes God to lay a croſſe vpon the ſhoulders
of any Chriſtian, that he may be glorified, and
to be a chaine of loue to bring thee to him, and to
keepe thee faſt with him: how will he helpe thee to
beare thy Croſſe? how will he draw the forward?
and how will he peace, and peace releeue thee and
ſet thee free:1 Cor. 10. cap. is it not written, Our God is faithfull,
and he will not ſuffer vs to be tempted aboue our ſtrength,
Hee will lay no more on thee then thou art able to
beare, he will not ſuffer one haire of thy head to periſh:Deut. 13. cap.
he ſayes, I chaſtice them whom I loue, for the Lord
your God doth try and proue you to know, if you loue your
Lord God with all your heart, and with all your ſoule.
Now in this meane time of his aduerſitie, what
comfortable ſpeeches? and what great aſſurance
giues he by his Prophet Dauid, He called on me (ſayes
he) and I heard him when he is in trouble, I am with him,
and I will deliuer him, and ſet him free, and I will glorifie
him. Now when a man or woman is burthened
with any worldly croſſe, can he goe to a better (or
can he goe to a more loving and wiſer) Counſailer,
to diſcharge the burthen of his griefe to, then to
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who knowes what is meeteſt
for the Intellectum tibi dabo et instruam te in wia
hac qua gradieris, firmabo ſuper te occulos meos, J will
(ſayes he) giue thee vnderſtanding, and I will teach
thee how and what way thou ſhalt winne free of
thy trouble, and I ſhall ever fixe my eyes vpon thee.
Now wilt thou but looke on all the great rulers and

principalities in this world. From the mighty and
ritch Monarch to the baſe and poore begger. And
tell me who can ſay he hath no Croſſe: beleeue me
not any, for that man hath not beene, nor for the
preſent is not, but he hath vexation, a griefe, and
a continuall croſſe. What although hee appeare
to the eyes of this worlde, moſt content in earthly
glory, in ritches or authority, yet for all that, before
night that day was never but hee had ſomwhat
to repent him ſelfe of. Then thou who art croſt, wil
thinke in thy heart, and ſay: O this man or woman
are happie, they haue no tribulation, they haue no
fighting with this world, their minde is in peace
and quietneſſe, they liue ſecure, and are crowned
Kings of their owne deſires. O foole, thou art deceaued,
for what is all our chiefeſt joy in this vale
of miſerie? euen nothing elſe but a ſunne-ſhine
pleaſure, bringing nothing with it but a grievous
ſtorme of infinite cares: O but what remedie, euen
this muſt be thy onely remedie, to ſay with the Prophet
Dauid, Tribulationem &amp; dolorem inueni &amp; nomen
domini inuocaui, In the time of my tribulation
and griefe, I called vpon the name of the Lord, hee
is the true Phiſitian that muſt heale thy ſores, and
be aſſured he will ſay to thee as hee ſaid to S. Paul
in his great temptations, Sufficit tibi gratia mea,
My grace is ſufficient to ſtrengthen thee, to keepe
thee, and defend thee in thy greateſt conflict, and
to be a ſtrong and mightie bulwarke againſt all
temptations, and aboue all things, let vs that are
ſinners and grievous offenders of GOD, thinke

and aſſure our ſelues that it is onely our owne
iniquities, and wicked life, which procures our
croſſe of tribulation: O then let vs not murmure
againſt GOD, but let vs looke to our owne
ſinfull life, that is the onely originall of all our miſeries:
how ought we then to repent, for it is onelie
ſinne diſpleaſes GOD, and nothing can pleaſe
him but repentance and mourning. Heere I will
ſet thee downe this compariſon: Take eye-ſalue and
applie it to any feaſtred part of thy bodie, it will neither
helpe nor releeue thee of thy paine, but take that eyeſalue
and applied to thy eye, it will helpe and releeue thy
eye. Euen ſo take mourning, and applie it to the loſſe of
ritches, it doth no good, applie mourning to the loſſe of
friends, it doeth no good, applie mourning to the loſſe of
honour, it doeth no good: but applie the teares of mourning
to thy feaſtred ſoule, it will doe good, it will bathe
thy feaſtred ſoule, it will embalme and mollifie her
wounds, and giue thee a true comfort in thy ſweete Redeemer
Ieſus Chriſt. It is onely he who will heare thy
lamentations, conſider thy diſtreſſe, and exhauſt vp
thy remēbrance in his mercy. When thou art wearied
&amp; faints, he is the true fountaine who will refreſh
thy wearied ſpirit, he calls vpon all that are fatigated
and oppreſſed: If any man be thirſtie, let him
come vnto me, and hee ſhall haue drinke. How joyfull
may the thirſtie ſinner be,Iohn. 7. cap. to haue acceſſe to
come and drinke of the true fountaine of life: heare
yet againe what ſweete conſolation hee powres in
thy heart by his Prophet:Nahum. 1. cap. 
               I haue afflicted thee alreadie,
and I will not afflict thee againe: As he would ſay,

there ſhall not come from me a double tribulation.
Now good Chriſtian, how may thy troubled ſoule
repoſe vpon this loving and infallible promiſe. Holy
and conſtant Iob, in the middes of his torturing
griefe,Iob. 18. cap. cries out to God, Although he kill me, yet wil
I truſt in him: and to animate thee, and to giue the
more ſtoutnes, that in aduerſitie thou be not overthrowne:
The royall Prophet Dauid cries to thee
with great courage, Expecta dominum viriliter age,
&amp; confortetur cor tuum &amp; ſustine dominum: Truſt in
the Lord, and fight manfully, our Lord will comfort
thy heart, and therefore abide his will, for the
Lord our God will not leaue thee, hee will not depart
from thee? what great confidence hath this holy
man had in GOD, for in the beginning of this
Pſalme, he ſayes, Seeing God is the protector of my life,
who can harme me: And againe, with great aſſurance
he ſayes, Si conſistant aduerſum me castra non timebit
cor meum: ſi exurgat aduerſum me prelium, in hoc ego
ſperabo, Giue whole armies were comming againſt
me, I ſhall not care, but hope in God, then hee followes
with this requeſt: I haue ſought one thing of
thee my God, that I may dwell all the dayes of my life in
thy houſe, and that I may ſee the glory and beautie of thy
Temple. Then when this bleſſed man begins to
thinke vpon the wondrous benefits of God beſtowed
on him with joy and gladnes of heart, he cries
out and ſayes, What ſhall I render the Lord for all his
benefits beſtowed vpon me, I will take the cup of ſaluation,
and call vpon the name of the Lord: If wee poore ingratefull
creatures, would meditate vpon the incomprehenſible

loue of GOD of his long ſuffering,
and gentle patience. How ſlow is he to wrath,
and how ſwift is he to mercy, what wrongs doeth
he receaue? They haue (ſaieth he) repayed euil for good.
Then when he perceaved their great vnthankfulneſſe,
their dulneſſe and hardneſſe of heart, and
that all what he did, could not moue his people to
turne to him. Then he cryeth out in great paſſion,
O ye Heauens be aſtoniſhed at this,
               Iere. 2. cap. 
               be affraied, and vtterly
confounded. And yet with more vehemence be his
Prophet, he ſayeth, Heare O Heauens, and harken O
Earth,
               Eſay. 1. cap. 
               for the Lord hath ſaid, I haue nuriſhed and brought
vp children, and they haue rebelled againſt me: The Oxe
knoweth his owner, &amp; the aſſe knoweth his maiſters crib,
but yet my people knoweth not me: Woe be to this ſinfull
Nation, a people loaden with iniquitie, a wiked ſeed, and
corrupt children, they haue forſaken their Lord, they
haue prouocked the holy one of Iſrael to anger, and they
haue gone backwarde. What an heavy lamentation
is this, how grievous was this complaint to the
Almighty GOD to make vpon baſe and filthy,
wake and worthleſſe, creeping vermeine of the
Earth, whom the twinkling of his eie, might haue
deſtroyed, and with the ſmalleſt breath of his anger,
brought an infinite number of worlds to nothing.
Who can ſtand before his wrath, ſaieth the Prophet
Nahum, or who can abide the fearceneſſe of his
wrath?
               Nahum. 1. cap. 
               his wrath is powred out like fire, and the rocks and
mountaines are broken with his anger. How oft hath
our ſinnes (even now in this preſent age) procured
that heavy and terrible wrath of GOD, even that

wrath, I ſay, which moues the Mountaines and
makes the hilles to trimble. Look (good Reader) and
thou ſhalt ſee how the ſparkes of GODS furious
wrath is ſpred throgh many parts of this world, we
may with teares houle and lament, and with vexation
of minde complaine and cry out with that holy
Prophet, Thine holy cities lywaiſt, Zion is become a wilderneſſe,
               Eſay. 64 cap.
               and Iaruſalem a deſert, the houſe of our Sanctuarie,
and of our glory where our forefathers praiſed thee, is
brunt and conſumed with fire, and all our pleaſant things
are waiſted and deſtroyed. How heavily doeth this man
of GOD complaine, how doeth he bevaill this deſolation
and deſtruction, and in the bitter paſſion
of his heart, he crieth out, Wilt thou hold thy ſelfe ſtill
at theſe things, O Lord, what wilt thou holde thy peace,
and afflict vs aboue meaſure? As he wold ſay, wilt thou
not take compaſſion vpon vs, and wilt thou not
withdraw thy heavy wrath from vs? What, without
all kinde of mercy ſhall we be vtterlie deſtroied?
No, not ſo, becauſe in his ſuperaboundant loue,
and wonderfull great pietie, hee comforteth vs,
and ſaieth,Eſay. 60 cap. 
               In my wrath I haue puniſhed thee, but in my
mercie I had compaſsion thee. And yet farther with
great regrate he maketh a ſweete and comfortable
promiſe, Whereas thou haſt bene forſaken and hated, ſo
that na man reſpected thee, I ſhall make thee an Eternall
glorie, and a joy from generation to generation. And
what more will our GOD of mercie doe? And
they ſhall (ſayeth hee) builde the oulde waiſt places,
               61. cap.
               and raiſe vp the former deſolations, and they ſhall repaire
all the Citties that were deſolate, and waiſt through

many generations. What great ſtore of Conſolation
doeth this promiſe of GOD giue to vs? and
with what meekneſſe of heart doeth he ſay, Indignatio
non eſt mihi I am not angrie, wrath is not
mine, I will freely forgiue thee, I will forgett all thy
ſinnes, and caſt them behinde my back, I ſhall
blot all thy wickedneſſe out ot my memory, and beleeue
me,Esek. 18 cap. I ſhall never thinke on thine offences any
more. Haue I any deſire that the wicked ſhould dye,
(ſayeth our Lord God) or ſhall he not liue, if he returne
from his wickednnſſe. And againe he perſwadeth vs,
ſaying, Caſt away all your tranſgreſsions, whereby you
haue tranſgreſſed, and make you a new heart and a new
ſpirit. Let the teares of remorſe purge the filth of
ſinne from our ſoule. O that we in all humilitie
wolde conſider, what and how many earneſt perſwaſions
our loving GOD hath laid, and ſtill layeth
before vs to turne home to him! Againe, hes our
abhominations and wicked life beniched vs from
his loue? O yet let vs not deſpare of his mercy! Although
our ſinnes were rid as ſcarlet,
               Eſay. 1. cap.

               Come vnto me all ye (ſaieth our Saviour)

And then he beginneth to reproue the ſluggard,
Goe labour in my vyne-yarde, why ſtand ye all the day
idle? Although we come with the laſt, yet we will be
rewarded with the firſt. Let vs throwe and caſt away
al hinders that lats vs and ſtaies vs from GOD.
Let vs (I ſay) in time mend our life, our good GOD
will helpe vs, he will make all impoſſibilities,Mark. 16 cap. poſſible.

all the way, how carefull were they to gette the
great ſtone rolled away from the ſepulcher dore;
and how ſoone they came to the dore, there they
found the ſtone rolled and turned away. Even ſo in
this happy journey of our converſion. Let vs caſt
away all worldly cares, and take vp our croſſe and
follow Chriſt, His yocke is ſweete, and his burthen is
light, we ſhall not walke in darkneſſe. Let vs ſay with S.
Auguſtine, Et tu Domine vſque quoquam diu? quam
diu? Cras &amp; cras, quare non modo? quare non hac hora?
finis eſt turpitudinis meae. O Lord, how long wilt thou
ſuffer me thus? How long? How long? ſhall I ſay
to morrow, to morrow, why ſhould I not convert
now? Why ſhould there not be an end of my filthy
lyfe, even at this very inſtant? And let vs all ſay
with the holy Prophet Dauid, O Lord create a new
heart in me, and renew my ſpirit, and that we May
caſt off the ould man, and put on the new man. O Lord
giue vs grace hereafter that we may walke circumſpectly,Epheſ. 4. cap.
and not like mad and inſolent fooles, in ignorance,Epheſ. 5. cap.
blindneſſe and errour, that we may redeme
the time that we haue ſpent in ſleuthfulneſſe,
and idleneſſe. Try me, O GOD, and ſearch my heart,
(ſaieth Dauid) proue me, and examine my thoghts: Conſider
if there be any way of wickedneſſe in me, and then O
Lord lead me in the way of eternitie. I pray GOD let
vs never like dogs turne to our vomet, ſtay ſtill with
vs O Lord, becauſe it is neere the night. When S.
Peter ſaies, And if the righteous ſcarcely can be ſaued,
where ſhall the vngodlie and the ſinner appeare.
               1. S. Pet 4. cap. What
a perellous ſpeech is this, for vs poore and miſerarable

ſinners, who ſtill heapes ſinne vpon ſinne.
Therefore deare brother, let vs cry, O Lord enter
not into judgement with vs, take all our ſinnes and
iniquities, and bury them in the bleeding wounds
of thy dearly beloved Sonne Jeſus Chriſt. Let the
temporall puniſhments of this life, deliver vs, and
redeme vs from the eternall paines of hell. Let vs
all ſay with S. Auſtein, Hic vre, hic ſeca, vt in aeternum
parcas. O good GOD mollifie our hearts, and
let vs not be hardned when we heare thy voyce,
giue vs that ſtrength of grace, that the filthy vapors
of our ſinnes extinguiſh not thine holy ſpirit in vs.
Da ſeruo tuo Domine cor docile: Giue vnto thy ſervant,
O Lord, a tractable heart to receaue inſtruction.
And O GOD we pray thee to remember
thy promiſe,Eſay. 66. cap. 
               Ad quem reſpitiam niſi ad pauperculum
&amp; contritum corde &amp; timentem ſermones meos? To
whom will I haue regard, or ſhew my favour, but
vnto the poore and humble of heart, vnto the contreat
ſpirit, and to ſuch as trimble at my ſpeeches?
Thou never yet, O Lord, deſpiſed the ſacrifice of a
contreat heart. So long as the ſinner remaines within
the darkned and miſty vapors of all wickedneſſe,
he can not beholde the odeous and vylde leproſie,
nor the filthy apparell which ſinne cleideth his
ſoule with all, the devill blinds him: but when he
reteares himſelfe from wickedneſſe, and walkes on
the faire way of Repentance, or when he ſtands vpon
the Mountaine of Amendement, and then
lookes forth from the turrat of a good-life, beholding
the filthy ſhape, and the ougly portrate of ſin.

O how will he then deteſt himſelfe that hath bene
ſo long ſwatring in that filthie myre, in that ſtinking
puddle of ſinne, putrified with all abhominations,
and how loathſome will ſuch company be to
him thereafter, he will eſchew them as a contagious
peſt, and ſay with the Prophet Dauid, Diſcedi te à
me omnes qui operamini iniquitatem quoniam exaudiuit
Dominus vocem fletus mei, Goe from me all ye
workers of iniquitie, becauſe my GOD hath
heard my weeping voice, and hath receaved my
prayer, or elſe he will intreate the wicked man with
gentle perſwaſions, with good examples, and loving
admonitions to ſhake off that filthie and contagious
habiet which infects the ſoule, and keepes
him back, and debarres him from the loue of GOD
and makes the Death of Chriſt to be for him in
vaine. S. Iohn the Evangeleſt ſayeth, It is onely to
them who beleeveth in him,1. cap. that hee hath given
power to be the ſonnes and children of GOD. It
is moſt ſure that onely want of faith maketh the
ſinner obſtinate, he is a lyer and can not beleue in
GOD. O thou poore and diſtreſſed creature looke
vpon thine owne miſerable eſtate, how thou gallops
poſt to hell, and will not looke back but goeth
on thy cairleſſe journey! When we walke alone
on the fields, when we walk ſolitare in our chalmer,
when we ly in our bed, will we but meditate vpon
the fearfull and terrible Majeſtie of GOD (whom
all the Heavens can ſcarce containe) of his vnſpeakable
glory, of his Almightie power. And it is onely
this great and Omnipotent Iehouah that we offend,

               To thee onely haue I ſinned, ſaith Dauid. And let vs remember
how for the eating of a ſillie apple, contrare
the Lords commandement, he condemned all
mankinde, and nothing could appeaſe his wrath,
nor yet ranſome the world, but the bloud and death
of his owne dearly beloved Sonne Jeſus Chriſt.
When wee thinke on this ſeveritie, and of GODS
terrible anger againſt ſinne, how loath ſhould we
be to offend GOD, and yet in very contempt
of GOD the wicked man will perſeveir in all
kinde of wickedneſſe, and ſtill deferre his Repentance,
till at laſt there ſhall be no time given him,
yea, not the halfe quarter of an houres minute granted
to him. Heare how the Prophet Dauid ſaieth of
ſuch men, Convertentur ad veſperam, &amp; famem patientur
vt canes &amp; circuibunt civitatem: And in the evening
they ſhall convert, they ſhall runne about the
Cittie, and barke like dogs, they ſhall houle for
meate, but ſurelie they ſhall not be ſatiſfied. O
that in time we wold take heed to this woful ſpeech!
And what more? GOD will mock them, and hold
them in derifion. It is to theſe that our Saviour will
ſay,Mat. 25 cap. 
               Neſcio vos, I knowe you not. Why? Becauſe
you had no Oyle in your lampes. And when he
hath knowen them, and all their wicked deedes
(which ſhall be accuſers of them, and laid open
to beare teſtimonie againſt them) O what will
he then ſay to them? Ite malidicti in ignem aeternum:
Goe you accurſed vnto the eternall fire of
Hell. And beſides all this, remember the ſharpe reckoning
muſt be made, when the leaſt idle word

we ſpeake, we muſt giue a count of it. O GOD
according to the multitude of thy mercies, be
mercifull to vs miſerable ſinners, in that fearfull and
terrible day of judgement. In time convert vs O
Lord, and we ſhall be converted. How happie is
that man who can withſtand the dangers of this
life with a well reſolved minde, and ſtill calles on
GOD to aſſiſt him in all his actions, for the temptations
of this world, are many, and wondrous
ſtrong. The devill is ſubtle, and we are eaſily inſnared,
and this our fleſh is exceeding ſubject to many
infirmities. So that without Gods helpe we are
not able of our ſelues to fight. Then with the Prophet
Dauid, Let vs all ſay, O Lord fight for vs, how
feeble, how weak, and faint-hearted are we? When
the leaſt blaſt of affliction ruines, all our ſtrength,
we can not ſtand after we ar raiſed vp, but preſently
falles againe, and turnes to our former wickedneſſe,
notwithſtanding of our repentance, and promeiſt
amendement. We haue no force to command
our ſelues. We periſh in our owne paſſions, and
moſt cowardly yeeldes to all ſorts of ſinnes. Thus
are we made ſlaues to our owne infirmities, in ſo
far that we make no kinde of reſiſtance to the ſmaleſt
motion. Concerning the paſſion of anger S.
Paul writting to the Epheſians, he ſayeth, Be angry,
but ſinne not,
               4. cap. 
               neither let the Sunne goe downe vpon your
wrath. This paſſion of anger is exceeding perillous,
for in that time that it doeth poſſeſſe the heart, it
for careth nothing, nor hath no reſpect to thinges
preſent, nor thinges to come: the fury of anger is

is the higheſt degrie of ſelf-madneſſe. The Italian
ſpeaking of the nature and condition of anger, He
ſayeth, Ira è breve furor, è chinol frena, è furor, longa
che el ſuo poſſeſſorè ſpeſſo à vergogno è talhor mena à
morte, Anger is a ſhort furie, and to him who
will not brydle it, it is a longſome furie, which
bringeth the poſſeſſour, either to ſhame or death.
That happie and learned Father Saint Aguſtein,
makes a very godlie and religious diſcourſe in his
conflict of vertue and vyce; firſt he maketh anger
to ſpeake, Quae aequanimiter ergate ferri non poſſunt
haec patienter ommino tollerare peccatum eſt, quia niſi
eis cum magna exaſperatione reſiſtatur, contra te deinceps
ſine menſura cumulantur: Who will not behaue
themſelues well towardes you, it is a ſinne to
ſuffer ſuch wrongs with patience, becauſe if thou
reſiſt them not with great bitterneſſe, and malitious
heatred of heart, they will (without all kinde
of meaſure) heape more vengence on thee. But
deere Chriſtian, heare how he maketh Patience
to anſwere, Si paſsio Redemptoris ad mentem reducitur,
nihil tam durum quod non aeque toleretur,
quanta enim ſunt haec quae patimur comparatione illius?
ille opprobria, irriſiones, contumelias, allapas, ſputa,
flagella, ſpiniam Coronam, Crucemque ſuſ
                     •
                  inuit, &amp;
nos miſert vno ſermone fatigamur, vno verbo deijcimur.
But if thou woldeſt call to minde the Paſſion
of our Maiſter and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,
There is nothing in the world ſo greivous or
heavie that thou woldeſt not ſuffer. Alas, what
can we ſuffer in reſpect of him, he ſuffered ſhame,

and mocking, contumelies, buffets, ſpitting in his
face, ſcourges, and the Crowne of thorne; and laſt
of all, he was Crucified: and we poore ſoules are
over-throwne with ſimple ſpeech, a word caſts vs
downe. O what a bright mirror may the Patience
of Chriſt be to man, even in his greateſt wretchedneſſe
and miſery. Let him call to minde the Paſſion
of our Saviour, and then we ſhall ſee what great
oddes is betwix his ſuffering and our ſuffering. It is
onely the example of ſuch a kinde and loving maſter,
will giue the patience, if thou confideſt in
Chriſt and art a true Chriſtian, Doctrina viri per patientiam
noſcitur. Againe, will we deeply conſider,
and we ſhal finde that in this tranſetoreous life, that
our eſtate is but meere miſery, and a continuall
change of ſorrow; ſo our beſt is not elſe, but vexation
of minde, and greef vpon greef. We are heere
in this world like the diſeaſed creature, warſling,
and ſtil turning on a bed of ſorrow, burdained with
ſicknes, and can finde no repoſe, no ſatled lare,
nor no reſt to our reſtles tortring-tribulations. Or
we are here like the wearied Pilgrim, who in many
forraine Countries, far from his owne ſoyle, liveth
exiled from his naturall home, and ſtill wandering
through many ſtrange parts, in ſundry perels, and
divers dangers of his life, ſpending his dayes, and
moſt parte of his nights in reſtleſſe travell, he walketh
the ſolitary deſerts, and wanders along the ſpatious
wilderneſſe; ſome-times oppreſſed with the
vehemency of heat, and ſome-times tormented
with the extremity of colde, when charitable harts

affords him hoſpitality, and refreſhment to his hungry
bowels, how contented will he be, and how
welcome will that reſt and repoſe be, then he be
ginneth to recall his paſt perrels to a reckoning,
when all his paines are turned to pleaſure, and
when his longſome journey ends, which brings an
end to all his miſeries, when his fatigations is refreſhed,
and his peregrinations hath no farther
courſe, then rypeth he a fruitfull harveſt, a joyfull
ſeaſon, and al the wearied Pilgrims paines are tranſformed
in pleaſure. We are all on earth going our
pilgramage, toſting and tumbling vpon the large
and depe Seaes of this world, threatned with the
devouring gulfes of temptations, and ſtill allured
with the glittering vanities of this preſent life.
Chriſt Jeſus being our carefull Pilot, he crieth to vs
poore paſſingers, and bids vs take heed to our journay,
that we periſh not in our paſſage, but that we
may be ſtill earneſt and watchfull, how to arryue
to that ſaif harbery of all tranquillitie, that heavenly
and eternall joy, which ſhall finiſh all our
troubleſome travels. How may the thought of this
progreſſe make vs to hate, to diſdaine, and contemne
the vain-glory of this world. O how ſhould
we cloſe our eies, and winke at ſuch abuſe, ſuch ſuperſtitious
vanities. Tell me who ever lived in
greateſt pompe? or who ever yet (to this houre)
had moſt command over this world, but was forced
to dye, and after death, be (as it were) quyte
forgotten. Holy Iob ſayeth, That their memory ſhould
be like aſhes, troad vnder foote. And the Prophet Dauid
               
ſaieth, That they ſhould be as duſt blowen abroad
with the winde. For what is all our glory? orwhat
is all our ornaments? Noght elſe but filth. Our
ſilkes and velvots which we wrap our ſelues in, is
noght elſe bot the excraments of wormes, and all
our eſtimations are but borrowed from beaſts, our
retches comes from the Centure of the earth. And
ſo all this that makes vs proud is but very filth.
Then what art thou, O man? Or what ſhall I compare
thy ſelf to? to noght elſe but to duſt, and all thy
glory is but earth &amp; duſt, blowne before the winde,
thou art a maſſe of earth, wraped vp in earth. This
made the wiſdom of GOD ſay to mankinde, Quid
ſuperbitterra &amp; cinis? Why doeth earth and duſt
become proud? When we haue tryed all things in
this world, then with experience we will ſay, all
things are vaniſhing like ſmooke, &amp; nothing is durable
excep the glory of GOD, all muſt turne to
noght. What then ſhall reſt to that ſoule who truſts
in this earthly Paradice? Let his terreſtial eſtate firſt
conſider the ſight of the ſtar-ſpangled-heavens, the
glorious Sun, the light-borrowing Moone, the bewtie
of women, delicat meates, ſavory guſts of ſweet
frutes, pleaſant harmonies of fine &amp; wel-ſounding
inſtruments, odeferous and fair flooriſhed gardens,
braue buildings, laſſivous danſing, mirry companions,
quick-witted-diſcourſes, and many more pleaſures,
all muſt end, all muſt be changed: Heare this
Proclamation, The voice of God ſaid, Cry: and the Prophet
ſaid,
               Eſay. 40. cap. 
               O Lord what ſhall I cry? Cry out, that all fleſh is
graſſe, and all the glory thereof is like the flower on the

field: the graſſe widreth, and the flower faideth. The
Prophet Dauid ſaieth, Vniverſa vanitas, omnis homo
vivens. And what ſaid great king Salomon in the top
of his glory, All was but vanitie of vanities. And S.
Iames calleth our life noght elſe but a vapor. How
ſwiftlie are we gone, ſome by one meanes, ſome by
other, man againſt man, beaſt againſt beaſt, every
one becomes a prey to other, all muſt pay that
doubtleſſe debt of Death, no creature can eſcape,
there is nothing more certaine, &amp; there is nothing
more vncertaine; we knowe not when, nor where,
becauſe ſtatutum eſt omnibus ſemel mori, it is ordained
that we ſhall all once dye. Then in our greateſt
mirth let vs ever ſay to our ſelues, Memento homo
quod pulvis es, &amp; in pulverim reverteris. O man,
remember that thou art but duſt, and in duſt thou
ſhalt returne againe. It is ſaid of the ambitious
wretch,Mendicant ſemper avari.
            
            
               THe mal-content hunts Fortune here and there,
               His euer-tortring-thoughts diſturbs his braine,
               Till all his hopes be drown'd in deepe deſpare,
               Then Time tels him his travels are in vaine,
               O earthly-wretch, what glory canſt thou gaine?
               When fruteles-labor thy ſhort life hath ſpent:
               A reſtles minde with ſtil-tormenting paine,
               Even whom a world of worlds could not content.
            
            
               Frō ſuch baſe thoghts heavens make my heart aſpire,
               And with a ſweete contentment crowne deſire.
            
            
               
Let vs beholde, and we ſhall ſee how in one day,
(yea, even in one inſtant time) ſome making riatous
bankets, ſome triumphing in all pleaſures, ſome
going to the ſcaffold to be executed, ſome women
travelling with childe, &amp; with great paines bringing
their children to the world, ſome lying in ſore
ſickneſſe, exſpecting death, the priſoner in bonds,
looking when he ſhould bid his laſt fair-well to the
world, ſome carying their children with honour to
receaue the Sacrament of Baptiſme, the bryd-grome
going with his bryde to ſolemneſſe Matrimony.
And againe, at that ſame inſtant, we ſhall ſee murnfull
companies, celebrating the funeralles of the
death, carying the dead carcatches, both of age and
youth to the graue. It may truely be ſaid of our inconſtant
eſtate.

                  Laeta ſit iſta dies neſcitur origo ſecundi
                  An labor, an requies, ſic tranſit gloria Mundi.
               
Sometimes are we merry, and ſometimes are we
ſad, Nunquam in eodem ſtatu. We are not perticepant
of the ſecrets of GOD, It is onely his providence
derects vs, we knowe not what ſuddaine change
may come, ſuch a ſwift courſe hath Time, and in
this meane-time, the glory of this world goeth away,
the moſt part of our life is ſpent in ſleep, and
how many in their mid-age is taken away, ſcarce
are we come in the world, when we returne againe
to the graue, very few comes to the period of Nature.
O when we truely thinke on Death, and calleth
to minde that perellous paſſage, how fearfull is
it, and what a ſtrange horror brings it to the heart

of mankinde, and cheefly to the vnreſolved, who
lives in all liberty of pleaſure, environed with all
worldly contentment, O mors quam amara eſt memoria
tua homini pacem habenti in ſubſtantiis ſuis: O
Death how bitter is thy memory to that man who
hes hurded vp ritches? how loath wil he be to leaue
his beutiful buildings, his faire allurements, and his
many pleaſurs? What a greefe is it to his heart that
he muſt departe and leaue them all behinde, and he
needs muſt goe and compeir before that great and
terrible Judge to giue a ſharpe reckoning how he
conqueſt all that ritches. O man thinke on thy end
and thou ſhalt neuer ſinne. Remember that thy glaſſe
ſhall once be runne, and that thy Sonne ſhall ſet,
and the horror of Death ſhall over-ſhadow thee,
and that there ſhall no pleading be heard after ſentence
is once given, Quia ex inferno nulla eſt redemptio,
Thy paines ſhall haue no end, thy torments
ſhal haue no diminiſhing. Therefore to you J cal, to
you that careles lives, and premeditats vpon miſchief,
and how to execute the damnable exploits
of the ever-laboring minde. To you who are the
ritch-gluttons of this world, and to you who feeles
not with what ſence I ſpeik. Conſider from whence
you came, where you are for the preſent, and
where you ſhall goe. You are here on Earth, Vbi
ſpectaculum facti eſt is Deo, angelis &amp; hominibus, where
you are in ſight of GOD, of Angels and of Men.
Now when ye are going, looke well to your journey,
your paſſage is all ſtraude over with thornes,
it is a perelous way, full of Ominus-threatnings,

planted with an hedge of many Prodegyous
Objects, Non eſt vitae momentum, ſine motu ad
mortem, There is no moveing of lyfe without a
motion to Death. Liue well, that you may dye
well. For looke in what eſtate you dye, ſo GOD
will finde you; and as he findeth you, ſo he Cenſureth
you; and as he cenſureth you, ſo he liueth you
for ever and ever. His decreit ſhall never be controlled,
nor his ſentence ſhall never be recalled.
As a growing tree when it is cut downe falleth to
that ſide where it did extend the branches when
it was in growth; Even ſo if thou deſireſt to fall
right, learne in thy grouth to extend ſuch frutefull
btanches as may ſway thee to the right ſide, and
make thee fall well. Sweete (ſaieth Saint Chriſoſtome)
is the end of the laborers, when he ſhall reſt
from his labors. The wearied traveller longeth
for his nights lodging, and the ſtorme-beattenſhip
ſeeketh vp for ſhore, the hyreling oft queſtioneth
when his yeares will finiſhe and come out;
the woman great with childe, will often muſe and
ſtudie vpon her deliverie. And he that perfitelie
knoweth that his life is but a way to death, wil with
the poore priſoner ſit on the doore threſhold, and
expect when the Jaylor ſhal open the doore; every
ſmall motion maketh him apprehend that the commander
with the ſerjants are comming to take him
from ſuch a loath ſome priſon. He looketh for death
without feare, he deſireth it without delight, and
he excepeth it with great devotion, he acteth the
laſt (and tragicall) parte of his life on a dulefull

ſtage before the eyes of the world, his geſture thirls
the beholders heart with ſad compaſſion, his words
of woe ſeaſoned with ſighes, doth bathe the cheeks
of the hearers with ſtill diſtilling teares, with a generall
relation of his former wickednes, he giues a
loude confeſſion of his ſecret ſinnes, with weeping
eyes, he calls for help of prayer, and like a hungerſtarued
begger, he howles and cries to that honourable
houſholder, ſaying, O good God open the
gates of thy mercies to the greatnes of my miſeries.
Caſt vp the Ports of thy vnſpeakable pittie to my
wearied ſpirit: receaue my ſoule in thy hands, and
anoynt her feaſtred wounds with the blood of thy
immaculate Lambe Chriſt Jeſus.
            
               T's true indeede this age is very ſtrange,
               For why? behold great men of ritch renowne,
               Time comes by turnes with vnexpected change,
               And from their Tower of pride doth pull them downe:
               Then what are we? but fooles of ſelfe-conceate,
               All what we haue ſtands in a ſtag'ring ſtate.
            
            
               Wee weeping come into this world of cares,
               And all our life's but battels of diſtreſſe,
               Scarſe is our prime when wint'ring age declares
               What weightie griefe our body doth oppreſſe,
               Bred with ſinne, borne with woe, our life is paine,
               Which ſtill attends vs to our Graue againe,
            
            
               Then earthly ſlime wherein conſists thy pride?
               Sith all thy glory goes into the ground,
               
                  
That bed of wormes wherein thou ſhalt abide,
               Thy faireſt face moſt filthy ſhall be found:
               Our ſunne-ſhine joyes, time ſwiftly ſweepes away,
               This night we liue, and dies before the day.
            
            Homo natus de muliere breui tempore viuens
repletur multis miſerijs.
            CAn thou part from thy beſt beloved friends
to goe in a farre Country, and not remember
how it reſembles the parting from this world to a
more ſtrange place. When thou riſes in the morning
what knoweſt thou will chaunce thee before
night. And if thou eſcape the dayes perrill, what
knoweſt thou will chaunce before the morning:
Omnem crede diem tibi diluxiſſe ſupremum, When
thou goeſt to bed, remember how it is the verie
image of thy graue: thy merrie companions are
parted, thy day being gone, and come is thy night,
thy riotous banqueting is finiſhed, and thou in a ſolitarie
retreat, puts off thy gorgeous apparrell, and
ſtrips thy ſelfe naked to thy ſhirt: ſo the pleaſures
of this inconſtant world ſhall part, thou ſhalt be
ſtripped naked of all thy ritches, and ſhalt carie
nothing with thee, but a ſimple winding-ſheet this
ſhall be, and this muſt be, 
                  Ʋt hora ſic fugit vita:
Therefore euery day take a reckoning of thy ſelfe,
and euery moment examine thy actions. Mark thy
behaviour firſt towards God, and next towards thy
neighbour. Conſider how the all-ſeeing eyes of
heaven lookes vpon all thy doings: and euer beware

of that ſinne which thou knoweſt to predominate
moſt in thee, ſeek by all meanes to oppreſſe it
and overcome it: take away all the occaſions therof,
or elſe it with the reſt of thy ſins, will draw thee
to hells fire, where nothing elſe is, but gnaſhing of
teeth, and eternall horrour. When thou haſt committed
any greevous ſinne, haue thou a true repentance,
a vnfained remorſe, and that thy heart ſhrill
within thee with angry griefe againſt thy ſelfe, then
thou may be aſſured that the ſpirit of God worketh
in thee: for it is a ſign of true &amp; vnfained repētance,
when the ſinner (without all kinde of hypocriſie)
mends his wicked life, making firſt ſatisfaction to
the great God by faſting and praying, making reſtitution
to thy neigbour, giue to the poore for Gods
cauſe, viſite the ſick, comfort and help the priſoner,
and giue hoſpitality to the diſtreſſed ſtranger:Iſay. 58. Cap. 
               Is it
not to deale thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring
the poore that wander into thine houſe. When thou ſeeſt
the naked, that thou couer him, and hide not thy face from
thine owne fleſh, For in the poore miſerable creature,
thou ſeeſt thy ſelfe as in a Glaſſe: And what
(ſayes the Prophet) ſhall be thy reward, Then ſhall
thy light breake forth, as the morning, and thine health
ſhall grow ſpeedily, thy righteouſnes ſhall goe before thee,
and the glory of thy great God ſhall embrace thee, &amp;c.
Thy vpright conſcience ſhal giue thee a great ſecurity
of thy ſoules helth, thy mercies ſhal meet thee,

               Bleſſed are the dead, who
dies in the Lord, becauſe they reſt from their labours,

and their works follow them. Now (good Chriſtian
Reader) J muſt end praying God that every one of
vs all may haue an earneſt cōſideration of our owne
eſtate, what we are, where we are, and how we ſhal
be heereafter: and once more J pray to our Lord
God, that we may ſtil remember (hoc momentū vnde
pendet aeternitas) that this little moment of our life, is
the ſhort ſpace, whereon dependeth all eternity of
eternall joyes, or elſe eternall paines: Jf wee haue
bin wickedly enclined, let vs with the deepe of our
hearts repent and think how the Axe is at the roote
of the tree, and let vs all endevour our ſelues with
the grace of God, to amend our life, that our filthie
nakednes may not be ſeene in that fearefull &amp; terrible
day of judgement, Domine ſecundum actum meum
noli me judicare, nihil degnum in conſpectu tuo egi: O
Lord judge me not according to my actions, J haue
done nothing worthy of mercy in thy ſight. Cloath
me with thy righteouſnes, that I may appeare righteous
before thy pittifull eyes. Ieſus eſto mihi Ieſus,
When the thundring voyce of thy Angels ſhal deſcend

qui Iacetis in ſepulchris, ſurgite &amp; occurite ad juditium

graues, riſe and runne ſwiftly to the judgement of
the Saviour, who with all his glorious Saints and
triumphing Martirs, ſhall ſit in his throne of vnſpeakable
glory, and judge both the quick and the

               O Man the treaſure of Gods glorious eye,
               Thou art ingrate, and to thy ſelfe vnkinde;
               Poore Caitiue wretch who ſees and will not ſee,
               Nor to eternall bliſſe will turne thy minde:
               Riſe ſloathfull riſe, forth of thy ſenſleſſe ſleepe,
               And for thy ſinnes, go ſigh, bewaile, and weepe.
            
            
               Heare how thy Saviour Ieſus Chriſt doth call,
               Come wearied and you burth'ned both to me,
               Come, come, ſayes he, I will refreſh you all,
               What ſweeter words would thou haue ſaid to thee?
               Thou art that ſheep, which wādring went aſtray,
               Chriſt on his back will bring thee to thy way.
            
            
               Thou ſinfull man is ſo with ſinne allur'd,
               That pleaſure of thy ſinne doth hold thee faſt;
               Thy wit, thy will, thy reaſon all obſcur'd,
               And now behold, forgets thy God at laſt:
               Thou art intrapp'd within ten thouſand ſnares,
               And blindlins rins to hell, thou never cares.
            
            
               The flying motions of thy minde ſtill burnes,
               And forward goes, her furie to fulfill:
               Youth and deſire, whoſe raging humor turnes
               
                  
To execute the horrour of their ill
               With no les price, thē with thy ſoule is bought,
               And whē all's got, they are but things of nought.
            
            
               Both day and night thou doth thy ſelfe annoy,
               To worke great miſchiefe with thy owne miſdeeds,
               Leſſe travaile farre would gaine eternall joy,
               Which ſweet Reward, all earthly paines exceeds:
               But thou art mad, and in thy madneſſe ſtrange,
               To quit thy God, and take the devill in change.
            
            
               At threatning ever ſenſleſſe, deafe, and dumb,
               Thou never lookes on thy ſwift-running-Glaſſe;
               Nor terror of the Judgement for to come,
               But ſtill thou thinks, thy pleaſure can not paſſe:
               All is deceit, and thou haſt no regard,
               Gods wrath at laſt, the ſinner will reward.
            
            
               To pray to God: why? then thou art aſham'd,
               For ſinne in thee ſhall ſuffer ſeandalies,
               Thy ruſty filth of conſcience ſhall be blam'd,
               Beſides, thy ſoule hath ſpoil'd her faculties:
               Thus doth the deuill ſo hold thee ſtill aback,
               Euen to the death, and then thy ſoule doth take.
            
            
               Alas poore ſoule, when God did firſt thee frame,
               Moſt excellent, moſt glorious and perfit:
               But ſince thou in that carnall body came,
               Thy favour's loſt, ſpoil'd is thy ſubſtance quite:
               O that thou would repent, and turne in time,
               God wil thee purge, &amp; clange thee of thy crime.
            
            
               
               God is a God of vengeance, yet doth ſtay,
               And ſparing, waites if thou thy life will mend
               With harmleſſe threatnings oft he doth aſſay,
               And oft he doth ſweet words of comfort ſend:
               If thou repent, his anger will aſſwage:
               If not, he will condemne thee in his rage.
            
            
               The ſonne of God, he for thy ſinfull ſake,
               To ſaue thy ſoule, with care he did provide,
               Mans filthy nature on him he did take,
               That he both cold, and hunger might abide:
               He many yeers on earth great wōders wrought,
               Still perſecute, and ſtill his life was ſought.
            
            
               When as his time of bitter death drew neere,
               The agony was ſo extreame he felt,
               That when he pray'd vnto his Father deere,
               In ſweating drops of bloud he ſeem'd to melt:
               Nail'd on the Croſſe he ſuffer'd cruell ſmart,
               vvhen as they pierc'd his hands, his feet, his hart.
            
            
               Great torment more was laid, on him alone,
               For thee and all mankind who will beleeue:
               Thou was not bought, with ſiluer, gold, nor ſtone,
               But Chriſt his life and precious bloud did giue:
               O let not then his bloud be ſhed in vaine,
               Whil'ſt thou haſt time, turne to thy God againe.
            
         
         
            
            THE SORROVVFVLL SONG
OF A CONVERTED SINNER.
            
               JOB. 7. CAP.
               I haue ſinned, what ſhall I doe vnto thee? (O thou preſeruer
of mankinde.)
            
            
               LEd with the terrour of my grievous ſinnes,
               Before Gods mighty Throne I do compeare,
               The horrour of my halfe-burſt heart begins
               To ſtrike my ſinfull ſoule with trembling feare.
            
            
               Where ſhall I ſeeke ſecourſe, or finde redreſſe?
               Who can my fearefull tort'ring thoughts devorce?
               Who can me comfort in my great diſtreſſe?
               Or who can end the rage of my remorce?
            
            
               I at compaſſions dore hath begg'd ſo long,
               That I am hoarce, and yet can not be heard
               Amids my woes, ſad ſilence is my ſong,
               From mirthleſſe-me, all pleaſure is debard.
            
            
               O time (vntimely time) why was I borne?
               To liue ſequeſtred ſolitar alone
               Within a wilderneſſe of Cares forlorne,
               Which grants no limit to my mart'ring Mone.
            
            
               My mart'ring Mone with wofull words doth pierce
               The aire, and next from hollow Caues rebounds
               This aequiuox my ſorrow doth rehearſe,
               And fills my eares with tributarie ſounds.
            
            
               
               Theſe ſounds diſcends within my ſlaught'red hart,
               And there transform'd in bleeding drops appeares
               Next to my eyes drawen vp with cruell ſmart,
               In water chang'd, and then diſtill'd in teares.
            
            
               My teares which falls with force vpon the ground,
               Jn numbers great of little ſparks doth ſpread,
               And in each ſpark my dolefull pictures found,
               J in each picture tragick ſtories read.
            
            
               I read Characters both of ſinne and ſhame,
               Drawne with the colours of my owne diſgrace,
               In figures black of impious defame,
               Which painted ſtands in my diſaſtred face.
            
            
               I breathleſſe faint with burthen of their woes,
               Such is my paine it will not be expell'd,
               Doe what I can, I can finde no repoſe,
               All hope of help againſt me is rebell'd.
            
            
               Gods mercie's great, I will expell diſpaire
               With praying ſtill: I ſhall the heavens moleſt
               Both night and day, vnto my God repaire,
               He will me heare, and help my ſoule oppreſt.
            
            
               The thought of hell makes all my haires aſpire,
               Where gnaſhing teeth ſad ſorows doth out-ſound,
               Where damned ſoules ſtill boiles in flaming fire,
               And where all endleſſe torment doth abound.
            
            
               
               Had they but hope, it might appeaſe their griefe,
               That in ten thouſand yeares they ſhould be free:
               But all in vaine, deſpaire without reliefe,
               Gods word eternall, moſt eternall be.
            
            
               When as our Chriſt in Judgement ſhall appeare,
               Cloath'd with the Glory of his ſhining light,
               And when each ſoule the trūpets ſound ſhal heare,
               They with their corps muſt com before Gods ſight.
            
            
               The Angels all, and happy troups of heaven,
               Incirkled rounds theatred in each place,
               A reck'ning ſharp of eu'ry one is given
               Before the Saints, and Gods moſt glorious face.
            
            
               The ſloathfull ſinner then ſhall be aſham'd,
               Who in his life would neither mend nor mourne
               To heare that ſentence openly there proclaim'd:
               Goe wicked to eternall fire, and burne.
            
            
               And to his bleſſed company, he ſayes,
               The Angels to my Kingdome ſhall convoy
               With endleſſe mirth, becauſe ye knew my wayes,
               Come reſt with me in never-ending joy.
            
            
               O let me Lord be one of thy elect,
               And once againe thy loue to me reſtore,
               Let thy inſpiring grace my ſpirit protect,
               With thee to bide, and never part no more.
            
            
               
               Once call to minde how deerly I am bought,
               When thy ſweet corps was ſpred vpon the Rood,
               Thy ſuff'ring torment, my ſaluation wrought
               Thy paines, thy death, and ſhedding of thy blood.
            
            
               O ſeeke not then my ſoule for to aſſaile
               Againſt thy might: how can I make defence,
               Thy bleeding death for me will naught auaile,
               Jf thou ſhould damne me for my lewd offence?
            
            
               Try not thy ſtrength, againſt me wretched worme,
               I am but duſt before thy furious winde,
               Nor haue I force to bide thy angry ſtorme,
               Then rather farre, let me thy favour finde.
            
            
               I Caitiue on this earth doth loure and creepe,
               I proſtrate fall before the heavens defaite,
               On thee ſweet Chriſt with mourning tears I weepe
               To pittie this my weake and poore eſtate.
            
            
               My poore eſtate which rob'd of all content,
               And nothing elſe but dolours doth retaine,
               The treaſure of my griefe is never ſpent,
               But ſtill in ſecret ſorrow I complaine.
            
            
               Heare my complaint, mark wel my words, ô Lord,
               Thou ſearcher of all hearts in euery kinde,
               Thou to my true conuertion beare record,
               And ſweepe away my ſinnes out of thy minde.
            
            
               
               I ſacrifice to thee my Saviour ſweet,
               And patient God who gaue me leaue to liue
               My ſighing-teares, and bleeding heart contreit,
               I haue naught elſe nor ritcher gift to giue.
            
            
               Thou God the Father, thou created me,
               And made all things obedient to mans will:
               Thou ſonne of God to ſaue my ſoule didſt die,
               And Holy ghoſt thou ſanctifieſt me ſtill.
            
            
               Thou Father, Sonne, thou holy Ghoſt divine,
               On my poore ſoule, let your ritch glory ſhine.
            
            FINIS.

               ONce did I ſee

               Then did I dread no harme.
            
            
               Now whilſt in Nectred-glory of her gaines,
               She ſits and ſuckes the faire well-flouriſh'd flower:
               My ſugred hopes are turn'd to bitter paines,
               And look'd-for-ſweet is nothing elſe but ſower:
               Ah cruell ſweet, Bee ſweet and cure my ſmart,
               Hony my mouth, but doe not ſting my hart.

               THou Phaeton thy firy courſe do'ſt end,
               And Cinthia thou with borrow'd light do'ſt ſhine
               Theſe woods their ſilēthorrors do out-ſend
               And Vallies lowe their miſtie Vapors ſhrine,
               Each liuely thing by Natures courſe doth goe
               To reſt, ſaue I, that wander now in woe.
            
            
               My plaints imparts theſe ſoli'd partes to fill,
               Weil'ſt roaring Rivers ſends their ſounds among,
               Each dreadful Den appeares to helpe me ſtill,
               And yeelds ſad Conſorts to my ſorr'wing ſong:

               I will advance, what feares can me affraye?
               Since Dreades are all debar'd by high diſpere,
               Like dark-nighs Ghoſt, I Vagabound aſtraye,
               With troubled ſpri't tranſported here and there,

               You flintie-ſtones take eares and eies to ſee
               This thundring-greif, with Earth-quake of my hart,
               That you may ſigh and weep with miſer-Mee,
               
               Melt at the tragick Commentes of my ſmart:
               Let theſe my teares that fall on you ſo oft,
               Make your obdurate hardneſſe to be ſoft.

               Patterne of paine, how do'ſt thou ſympathize
               In viſage wan, and Pilgrim's weede thou beares?
               And on theſe ſignes of miſcontent-attire.
               Still doe I read, debard from my deſire.
               
            
            
               This hairie-Rob which doth my corps conteen,
               This Burden, and my rough-vnraſed-heade
               A Winter and a Sommer haue I been
               In dangers great, ſtill wandring in this weede;
               Loe thus the force of my diſaſters ſtrange
               Hath made me make this vnacquainted-change.
            
            
               I am dri'd vp with Dolors I endure,
               My hollowe eyes bewray's my reſtles night,
               My viſage pale, ſelf pittie doth procure,
               I ſee my ſoares deciphr'd in my ſight,
               A Pilgrime ſtill, my Oracle was ſo,
               
                  And made my name, AH MISER MAN I GO.
            
            
               Now doe I goe, and wander any way,
               No ſtrange eſtate, no kinde of trau'ling toyles,
               No threatning Croſſe, nor ſorrow can me ſtay,
               
                  
To ſearch and ſeeke through all the ſorts of ſoyles.
               So round about this Round ſtill haue I run,
               Where I began, againe I haue begun.
            
            
               In ſtrangeſt parts, where ſtranger I may bee,
               An out-caſt loſt, and voyed of all releife,
               When ſaddeſt ſight of ſorrow I can ſee,

               If Wonders ſelfe can wofull wonders ſhowe,
               That ſight, that part, that wonder I will knowe.
            
            
               Thus doe I walke on forreigne fields forlorne,
               To careleſſe Mee, all cares doe proue vnkinde,
               I doe the Fates of fickle Fortune ſcorne,
               Each croſſe now breeds contentmēt to my minde
               Aſtoniſh of ſtupendious things by day,
               Nor howling ſounds by night can me affray.
            
            
               You ſtately Alpes ſurmounting in the skyes,
               The force of floods that frō your hights doun falles
               There mightie Clamors with my carefull Cryes,
               The Ecchoes voice from hollow Caues recalles:
               The ſnow-froz'n-cluds down frō your tops do thū
                  der
               their voice with mine doth tear the air a sūder.
            
            
               And Neptune thou when thy proud ſwelling wrath
               Frō gulphs to mountains mou'd with winters blaſt
               In anger great when thou didſt threaten Death
               Oft in thy rage, thy raging ſtormes I paſt,
               And my ſalt teares increaſt my ſaltnes more,
               My ſighs with winds made all thy bowels roare.
            
            
               
               The ſpatious earth &amp; groundleſſe deep ſhall beare
               A true Record, of this my mart'ring mone;
               And if there were a world of worlds to heare,
               (When from this mortall Chaos I am gone)
               I dare approue my ſorrow hath bin ſuch,
               That all their witt's can not admire too much.
            
            
               On the colde ground my Caytife-carcaſſe lyes,
               The leaueles-trees my Winter-blaſted-bed:
               Noe Architecture but the Vap'rous skyes,
               Black-foggie-Miſt, my weari'd corps hath cled,
               This loathſome Laire, on which I reſtles tourne
               Doth beſt befit Mee-Miſer-man to mourne.
            
            
               With open eies Nights-darknes I diſdaine,
               On my Croſ'd-breſt I Croſſe my Croſſed armes;
               And when repoſe ſeekes to prevent my paine,
               Squadrons of Cares doe ſound their freſh alarmes
               So in my ſleep (the Image of pale-Death)
               Theſe ſighing words with burthē-bruſ'd I breath
            
            
               I ever rowl'd my Barge againſt the ſtreame,
               I ſcal'd thoſe ſteppes that Fortune did me frame,
               I Conquer'd, which impoſſible did ſeeme,
               I, haples I, once happie I became:
               Now ſweeteſt joy is turn'd to bitter gall,
               The higher vp, the greater was my fall.
            
            
               What paſſing Follies are in high Eſtates,
               Whoſe fooliſh hopes giues promiſe to aſpire:
               Self-flatt'rie ſtill doth maske the feare of fates,
               
                  
Till vnawars deceiu'd in ſought deſire:
               This breeds diſpare, thē force of Fortunes change
               Sett's high Eſtates in dread and perrill ſtrange.
            
            
               There ſecret grudge, Envie and Treaſon dwelles,
               There Juſtice lies, in Dole-bewraying weede:
               There flyding Time with alt'ring feates ſtill telles
               The great Attempts ambitious mindes doe breed:
               They who haue moſt, ſtil hunts for more &amp; more
               They moſt deſire that moſt ar choak'd with ſtore.
            
            
               Henceforth will I forſake Terreſtiall Toyes,
               Which are nought elſe but ſhawdowes of deceat,
               What cover'd danger is in earthly joyes,
               When vilde Envie, triumphes on each Eſtate.
               Thou Traytour Time, thy Treaſon doth betray,
               And makes youths Spring in floriſh faire decay.
            
            
               What's in Experience which I haue not ſought,
               All (in that All) my will I did advance,
               At higheſt rate, all theſe my witts are bought
               In Fortunes-Lottrie, I haue try'd my Chance,
               So what I haue, I haue it not by ſhowe,
               But by Experience which I truely knowe.
            
            
               Long haue I ſearcht, and now at laſt I finde
               Eye-pleaſing Calmes the tempeſt doth obſcure,
               When I in glory of my proſperous winde,
               With white-ſweld-ſayles on gentle ſeas ſecure,
               And when I thoght my loadſtar ſhinde moſt faire
               Ev'n then my hopes made ſhipwrack on diſpaire
            
            
               
               My ſight is dark, whil'ſt I am over-throwne,
               Poore ſilly Barke that did pure loue poſſeſſe:
               With great vngratefull ſtormes thus am I blowne
               On ruthleſſe Rocks, ſtill deafe at my diſtreſſe.
               So long-ſought-Conqueſt doth in ruin's boſt,
               And ſaies behold, thy loue and labor's loſt.
            
            
               Since all my loue and labor's loſt, let Fame
               
               Spit forth her hate, and with that hatefull ſcorne
               In darke oblivion ſepulchrize my name,
               And tell the world that I was never borne.
               In me all earthly dream'd-of-joy ſhall ende,
               As Indian hearbs which in black ſmok I ſpend.
            
            
               Al-doting pleaſure, that all tempting-devill,
               I ſhall abhor, as a contag'ous Peſt
               I'le purge and clenſe my ſenſes of that Evill,

               In ſable-habit of the mourning blacke,
               I'le ſolemnize my oath and vow I make.
            
            
               Then goe vaine World, confuſed Maſſe of nought,
               Thy bitterneſſe hath now abuſ'd my braine,
               Avoid thy deu'lliſh Fancy from my thought,
               With idle toyes torment me not againe:
               My Time which thy alluring folly ſpent,
               With heart contreat and teares I doe repent.

            FINIS.
         
         
            
            HIS
DYING SONG.
            
               Circundederunt me dolores mortis, &amp; pericula
inferni in venerunt me.
            
            
               NOw hapleſſe Heart, what can thy ſors aſſwage,
               Since thou art gript with horror of deaths hād
               Thou (baleful-thou) becoms the Tragick ſtage,
               Where all my tortring thoughts theatred ſtand,
               
                  Grief, feare, death, thoght, each in a mōſtrous kinde
               Like vgly monſters muſter in my minde.
            
            
               Thou loathſome bed to reſtleſſe-martred-Mee,
               
               Voide of repoſe, fil'd with conſuming cares;
               I will breath forth my wretched life on thee,
               For quenchleſſe wo and paine, my graue prepares
               Vnto pale-agonizing-Death am thrall,
               Then muſt I goe and anſwere to his call.
            
            
               O Memorie moſt bitter to that man,
               Whoſe God is Golde, and hoords it vp in ſtore;
               But O that blind-deceiuing-Wealth, what can
               It ſaue a life, or add one minute more?
               When he at reſt, rich-treaſure in his ſight,
               His Soule (poore foole) is tane away that night.
            
            
               
               And ſtrangers gets the ſubſtance of his gaine,
               Which he long ſought with endles toyles to finde,
               This vilde-worlds-filth, and excraments moſt vaine,
               He needs muſt dye, and leaue it all behinde:
               O man in minde remember this, and mourne,
               Naked thou cam'ſt, and Naked muſt retourne.
            
            
               I naked came, and naked muſt retourne,
               Earths ſtart'ring pleaſure is an idle toy;
               For now I ſweare my very Soule doth ſpurne,
               That breath that froth, that moment-fleeting-joy;
               Then fare-well World, let him betrai'd ſtill boſt
               Of all miſchiefe that in Thee truſteth moſt.
            
            
               Burnt Candle, all thy ſtore conſum'd thou end's,
               Thy lightning ſplendor threats for to be gone,
               O how doſt thou reſemble Mee that ſpend's,
               And ſighs forth life in ſighing forth my mone?
               Thy light Thee lothes, I loth this lothed life,
               Full of deceipt, falſe-envie, grudge and ſtrife.
            
            
               I call on Time, Tim's alt'red by the change,
               I call on Friends, Friends haue cloſ'd vp their eares;
               I call on Earthly-powers, and they are ſtrange,
               I call in vaine when Pittie none appeares.
               Both Time and Friends, both Earthly-powers and al,
               All in diſdaine are deafe at my hoarſe call.
            
            
               Then Prayer flow from my heart-humbling-knees
               To the ſupreame Coeleſtiall power aſpire
               Shew thou my grief to Heavens-al-ſeing-eies
               
                  
Who never yet deny'd my juſt deſire:
               Mans-help is nought, O GOD thy help I craue,
               Whoſe ſpotles-bloud my ſpotted-ſoule did ſaue.
            
            
               Then take my ſoule, which bought by thee is thine
               Earth-harbring-worms take thou my corps of clay
               O Chriſt on me eternall mercy ſhine,
               Thy bleiding wounds waſh all my ſins away:
               I come, I come, to thee O Jeſu ſweit,
               And in thy hands I recommend my ſpirit.
            
            FINIS.
