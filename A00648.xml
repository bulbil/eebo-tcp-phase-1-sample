            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               culler at the Hope on the Banke-side, at a

friends house of mine, acquainted me with his Proiect; which was as followeth: That hee the said Taylor had studied such seuerall Humors in Prose, as neuer were the like before: (which indeede fell out true, to his shame) wherein hee would haue me ioyne; hee to play a Scene in Prose, and I to answere him in Verse: Whereto I condiscended, on these Conditions; viz. That I might haue halfe the Commoditie thereof; Or Securitie for fiue pounds; Or else twentie shillings in hand, and the rest as the Day affoorded. Next, That I might heare his Booke read (which was fit) to know on what ground I might build my Inuention. And last, That I should see the Manner of his Challenge before it was published, and set my Answere to it with my owne hand. To all which hee graunted, and deliuered mee fiue Shillings vpon the same: Whereupon I promised faithfully, That if all this were on his part performed, I would (God willing) meete him, and with my best endeauor striue to give the Audience content. Now, here I must entreat you, before you condemne mee, note but the Occasions of my Breach of Promise: This Water-Taylor, with his Confederates, presuming he had bound

me with his Earnest-money, printed his Challenge-Bill, and my Answere annexed thereunto, without my Hand, Knowledge, or Consent: Nay more; My Answere was by him set vp so meane and insufficient to so brauing a Challenge, that I altogether disliked thereof (as I had reason) and thereupon sent my Man with the Money fiue dayes before the Play, to certifie them, That I was otherwise employed, and would not come, in regard of the Wrong done vnto mee, in setting vp my Answere without my Consent: My Man deliuered the Message, but lost the Money at Play, emboldening himselfe vpon the Wrongs I had receiued; which I haue since payed. And the same day I receiued a Letter out of Warwickeshire from my Father, That he was not well; wishing mee and my wife to repayre vnto him with all possible speede. Now, you that are Parents of Children, or Children to Parents, Iudge, whether I ought rather to disobay my Father, or displease Iohn Taylor; purchase my Fathers hate, or lose a Scullers loue; and I hope you will say I had sufficient cause to keepe me from the Hope. But fearing my homely Truth (though it be sufficient to plead my Honestie) is not answerable to your

               AN APOLOGIE to the Anagram of my Name, made by no Scholler, but a Sculler.
               IT were a simple Tree thy breath could shake;
               But see (meere Malice) how thou dost mistake:
               For what thy Title would bestow on me,
               They selfe art Author of. New Villanie.
               But since thou vrgest me, marke how Ile blase
               That name; which thou wt villanie wouldst glafe:
               For I will ope the Casement, and cleare Light
               Shall chase thy blacke verse to eternall Night.
               When the first William, Duke of Normandie,
               Sayl'd from the Coasts of France to Britanie,
               Amongst his best Rankes came a Chiualiere,
               Whose name in French was called le Fogniere,
               
               Which thē our English Toung so well did tender,
               Gaue him the Name and Title of Defender.
               On the Sea-coasts he did defend so well,
               That for his Crest he beares the Scallop shell.
               Since, briefer Language giues vs Fennors name,
               Nor can thy impudence impaire the same:
               And for a Token of wrong'd Innocence,
               I doe resume my first name for Defence.
               My Anagram if thou but rightly scan,
               Then thou wilt finde 'tis, I will feare no man.
               
               
                  How can I then feare thee that art a Taylor,
               A shred of Fustian, and a ragged Raylor;
               A dish that is not worth the feeding on,
               When thou art best in Lent, th'art but Poore Iohn.
               
            
            
               An Anagram vpon the Scullers Name. IOHN TAYLOR, Anagramma. O Hate, rayle on.
               O Hate rayle on; or this, Rayle on, O Hate:
               For spight of Rayling, I must dedicate
               An answere to thy Theame, though nere so large,
               Will sink thy Scullers Boat, though 'twere a Barge.
               To halter vp your Muse, my Muse beginnes;
               Ile trusse the Iade for breaking peoples shinnes.
               Then Monster doe thy worst, yerke out thy fill,
               Thou canst not touch my godnesse with thy ill:
               Though Horses breake their Bridles, and escape,
               My Lines shall loade an Asse, or whippe an Ape.
            
            
               
               To his approued Foe Iohn Taylor.
               I Haue lookt ouer with my best Prospectiues,
               And view'd the tenor of thy base Inuectiues:
               But if thou knewst how slenderly I weigh them,
               Thou wouldst not make such labor to display them,
               All that my Lyntia in thy vaine discernes,
               Is Roguish Language, such as Newgate learnes.
               I thinke thou hast beene tutor'd in the Stewes;
               For thine's the perfect speech they onely vse:
               Base Roguish Wishes, Cursing, and Reuiling,
               Tempestuous Raylings, and good Names defiling.
               Yet maugre Mallice Iohn, I pitie thee
               For all the paines thou hast bestow'd on me;
               And were my Purse but of abilitie,
               Ide recompence thy labours horriblie:
               But since my meanes vnable is to right thee,
               Marke how my Penne in kindnes shal requite thee.
               I will bestow a sheet or two of Paper,
               And sit the burning of a Tallow Taper,
               To tell thee thou art monstrous insolent:
               Although thy Verse is lame and impotent;
               And at the highest, thou art but partaker
               With Libell-spreaders, or some Ballade-maker.
               But doe not thinke thou dealst with Coriate,
               
               Whose bosome thou didst bolt a Storie at;
               
                  Nor looke not for such Batterie at my Walls,
               As 'gainst the Knight o'the Sunne, or Archibales;
               Expect not Captaine Ottooles vnderstanding:
               No, no; against a Bulwarke thou art banding
               Of better temper, and a Nobler spirit,
               Then euer thy base bosome could inherite.
               'Gainst Cynthia, like a Wolf, th'oult bark &amp; howle,
               Wherby thou shewst thy iudgemēt dark &amp; fowle.
               Thou grieu'st, my Muse with her reflecting rayes,
               Hath quite ecclipst a famous Scullers prayse:
               Thou wouldst haue Poesie in none to flourish,
               But in thy selfe; O thou art too too currish:
               Banish this selfe-conceit; false shadie dreames
               Hang in thy heart, and driue thee to extreames.
               But why doe I presume to counsell thee,
               That hat'st good Counsell, as thou hatest me?
               Wherefore I leaue thy brasen Impudence,
               To answere thy Reuenge with my Defence.
            
            
               Defence.
               HOw Rascall-like, thou dealst with me at first;
               Thou shewst frō what Antiquitie th'art nurst:
               How darst thou of thy Satyre-Musicke boast,
               That now stands bound vnto the whipping Post?
               But I will spare thee, thou intemperate Asse,
               Vntill in Bride-well thou shalt currant passe.
               Thou sayst, I had better with the Deuill deale;
               By which thou do'st thy wickednesse reueale:
               
                  But I haue naught to doe with him or thee;
               If thou be his companion, God blesse me.
               To crouch, or whyne, thou giu'st me no occasion;
               But I must laugh at thy absurd persuation:
               Thou art that Lernean Snake, squeeze thine owne gall,
               But 'tis too bad to make thee Inke withall.
               Th'ast gone so long to Styx for mingled Inke,
               That all thy verses in mens nosthrils stinke.
               For Pens, the Scrich-Owles fethers are too tough;
               A Gooses Wing for thee is good ynough.
               Thou hast emblas'd me, Basest slaue of Men;
               That name I freely send thee backe agen,
               Vntill the World hath better eyes to see
               Which is the basest Iacke, my selfe, or thee.
               Thou call'st me Rogue so artificiall,
               That I must iudge thee for one naturall:
               The Iniurie proceeded from thy toung,
               And yet yu wouldst make me thy cloake for wrong.
               But do'st thou thinke the matter is no more,
               But hang my selfe; thy counsell I abhore:

                  Iohn Taylor ended like Achitophel.
               
               What foolish Asse, like thee, would take in hand
               To play a Play, that couldst not vnderstand
               What thine owne follie is, thou art so blinde;
               Onely to basenesse thou art well inclin'de.
               Do'st thinke I had no businesse, but to wait
               On thy detested Fopperies Conceit:
               
                  Yet I protest, hadst thou but sent the Bill
               For me to answere, Ide haue shew'd my skill:
               Which would haue beene so much to thy disgrace,
               That thou againe durst nere haue shew'd thy face.
               Canst thou imagine, that I went away
               For feare of thee, or thy contemned Play:
               Know foole, when on the Stage I purchasd worth,
               I scornd to send for thee to helpe me forth.
               And put the case that I should challenge thee,
               Thy rayling Spirit could not answere mee:
               For thou art nothing without three months studie;
               Ide beat my braines out, if they were so muddie.
               Fiue shillings I confesse I had of thee;
               Which I protest my seruant had from me
               For to repay thee: but since he did sayle,
               Thou mightst haue sent to me; not write, and rayle
               On him, that holds his honestie more deare
               Then all the Thames Reuenewes in a yeare.
               But here thou driu'st me to a short demurre,
               To know why thou shouldst call a Christian, Curre:
               Oh, I haue found it; to my griefe I see,
               That Curres and Christians are alike to thee.
               But was thy credit by my treason slaine;
               Faith I know none thou hadst to lose or staine.
               I wonder much at thy simplicitie,
               That thou shouldst chalenge me for sharking thee;
               When of my troth I had rather giue thee gifts,
               Then see thee driuen to such paltrie shifts.
               
                  Thou and thy Squire oft have ferried mee,
               More oft then I and mine haue rim'd to thee,
               If euer I haue sung to nastie Whores,
               Thou or some Pander, like thee, kept the dores:
               For I am sure, that for as little meanes,

               For mee to rime, that thou shall haue my share:
               For though much wealth I want to maintaine mee
               I'll neuer trouble Whores, nor Rogues, nor thee.

               But they were all ashamd of thy distraction,
               For them, as much as thine, my praise alowe,
               For none amongst them plaide the foole but thou:

               The better sort said I was wise enuffe,
               To keep me out of that black whirle-winde puffe,
               Which almost blue the hangings from the stage,
               Was ere such folly knowne in any age?

               That all the people cry'de, Enough, enough.
               Thy third Act shew'd the humors of men frantick,
               Wherin, most like an Asse, thou stoodst for Antick:
               I saw it not whether it were good or bad;
               But wise men iudge thee either foole, or mad.
               Thy last Act shewes thy skill vpon the Seas
               To be so rare; it did them all displease:
               And in conclusion, such a Tempest rose,
               That blew thee off, and made thy friends thy foes.
               And woldst thou load my back with al this blame?
               Nay; as thou got'st the coyne, so take the shame:
               And let me tell thee this, to calme thy Rage.
               I chaleng'd Kendall on the Fortune Stage;
               And he did promise 'fore an Audience
               For to oppose me; note the Accidence:
               I set vp Bills, the People throng'd apace,
               With full intention to disgrace, or grace;
               
                  The House was ful, the Trūpets twice had foūded,
               And though he came not, I was not confounded,
               But stept vpon the Stage, and told them this;
               My Aduerse would not come: not one did hisse;
               But flung me Theames: I then extempore
               
               Did blot his name from out their memorie,
               And pleasd them all, in spight of one to braue me,
               Witnesse the Ringing Plaudits that they gaue me.
               Was not this iust the case 'twixt me and thee?
               And yet thy eyes thine owne faults cannot see.
               Ile touch thee neerer: Hadst thou beene away,
               As I was, and my selfe supply'de the day,
               I would haue rows'd my Muse incontinent,
               With Mirths best quaint deuise, for their content;
               And in extempore I would haue gain'd
               The fauor of them all; which thee disdain'd.
               But thou art hatcht from Saturnes frozen braine,

               If there be any sparke of Muse in thee,
               It is the tayle-gut of Melpomenie,
               
               Which doth instruct thee in thy filthie tearmes;
               There's nothing else in thee my Penne affirmes.
               Hadst thou done well, the credit had been thine;
               But doing ill, thoud'st haue the shame be mine.
               The Money pleasd thy humor passing well;
               But thy discredit made thy anger swell
               Aboue the verge of Patience; and thy Sayle,
               Blowne full of Enuie, bursts it selfe to Rayle,
               
                  Not publikely, but in a priuate Hole
               Kindle thy Mallice at the Deuils coale:
               But I with water of true Honestie
               Will quench thy raging heat of Villanie.
               How brauely thou canst brag it out, and swagger,
               And talk of stabbes (God blesse vs) &amp; thy dagger:
               I would not see thy spightfull spit-Frog drawne,
               'Twill serue thee better for an Ale-house pawne.
               Thou scornst to foule thy fingers vpon men,
               Because thou knowst they will shake hands agen:
               But thou art excellent at these windie puffes,
               And darst encounter boyes at fisticuffes;
               But Sirrha, looke to your greene Wastcoat well,
               For feare the boyes doe teare it off peccemell.
               All the kinde fauor that I will implore,
               Is, That thou wouldst not threaten me no more:
               And yet, now I remember, 'tis no wrong;
               For threatned folke (the Prouerbe sayes) liue long:
               But with thy Penne write, &amp; reuenge thy spleene,
               Ile haue an Answere that shall cut as keene.
               But now base Slanderer, I must tearme thee so;
               Why medlest thou with them thou dost not know:
               This long I haue but spent my Inke in ieast,
               But now Ile dart my anger at thy breast:
               I would I had the humor of some Scold,
               That I, like thee, my venome might vnfold.
               Thou neuer knewst my birth, nor my begetting,
               So well as I thy Rascall Play, and Cheating:
               
                  But whatsoere my birth or breeding bee,
               Spider, I liue to tosse and torture thee,
               Vse thee like Stock-fish, gill thee like a Sprat,
               Duck thee i'the Towne-ditch, like a Water-Rat,
               Make Iigges and Ballads of thy apish Toyes,
               For to be sung by thred-bare Fidlers Boyes:
               Yet to doe this, I shall but proue a Babie;
               Thou hast disgrac'd thy selfe as much as may be.
               Thou Barrabas of all humanitie,
               Base slanderer of Christianitie,
               Know that I am a Christian, and am borne
               Better then thy best Kindred, Ile be sworne:
               How thy own tongue thy breeding doth display,
               By Pedlers French, and Canting, Curds &amp; Whay;
               And Ile approue it to thy foule disgrace,
               Thou art sprung from basenesse; I, from Gentries Race:
               Which to make good, my Parents yet doe liue,
               And each day at their Table food doe giue
               To better men then thou; mishapen slaue:
               Thus beare thy slanders with thee to thy graue.
               If I at Grauesend rim'de for foureteene pence,
               For 12. pence thou hast row'de that voiage since:
               Allow it were no more; I bor't away
               With better credit then thou didst thy Play.
               Thy enuie is not worth the speaking of;
               The more thou raylst at me, the more I laugh:
               I scorne to begge (as thou dost) Poets phrases
               To raise my name; let Merit sing my praises:
               
                  For were they meaner then thy own desert,
               They were the worse where thou shouldst sing a part:
               Thou dost but thinke there's nothing good in me;
               But I am sure there is much lesse in thee.
               That hate thou bear'st me, prethee beare me still,
               My good with enuie all thy veines shall fill,
               Vntil they swell and burst thy angrie gall:
               Then if I liue, I will lament thy fall;
               And on thy graue this Epitaph bestow,
               For to be read for either friend or foe.
            
            
               Epitaph.
               HEre lyes a Carkasse in this Graue,
               Who while he liu'd, would rayle and raue;
               Borrow his wit from others worth,
               And in his owne name set it forth:
               He row'de from Tyber to the Thames,
               And there his tongue himselfe proclaimes
               The luster of all Watermen,
               To row with Scull, or write with Pen.
               O, had he still kept on the Water,
               And neuer come vpon Theater,
               He might haue liu'de full merrily,
               And not haue di'de so lowsily.
               O, 'twas that foolish scuruie Play
               At Hope that tooke his sence away:
               Yet he to blot out all his shame,
               Imputes the fault on Fennors name;
               
                  And rayl'de at him like a mad bodie;
               Liu'de a bare Foole, di'de a base Noddie.
               But if you'le know what was his name,
               I willingly will shew the same:
               No Land-Poet, nor Sea-Saylor,
               But a poore Sculler, call'd Iohn Taylor:
               And had not Hate this Wonder slaine,
               He would haue liu'de a Knaue in graine.
               Thus Iack thou seest what friendship I would do,
               Garnish thy Graue out with a verse or two:
               But yet thou art aliue, and I surmise
               Thou wilt not die till Crowes pecke out thy eyes.
               Ide wish thee sayle vnto some foraine Places,
               Where they haue neuer heard of thy Disgraces:
               The Baramoodes Toung thou dost professe;
               The name of Poet there thou may'st possesse:
               There spread thy Pamphlets, make thē vnderstand
               Thou art the chiefest Poet in that Land.
               Thou sayst my Pate a mint of Lyes can forge;
               Indeed t'has wit ynough thy lyes to scourge:
               For I was neither ridde South, North, nor East,
               But into Warwikeshire, direct Northwest:
               Nor did I thither ride, to shunne thy Play,
               But 'twas my Fathers will call'd me away;
               And for th'obedience that he in me found,
               He gaue me his blessing, with a hundred pound.
               Then Sculler know, that was no Tinkers gift,
               Nor had I need for thy poore Crowne to shift:
               
                  But he that told thee I was gone int' Kent,
               Spoke halfe as true as thou dost, lies inuent.
               But see how Enuie in thy heart doth trot,
               Thou grieu'st that I a poore mans Pardon got;
               Is thy eye euill then, 'cause mine is good?
               Or wouldst thou stop my Fountaine with thy mud?
               No; spight of thee, thou Canniball to man,
               I will not cease to doe what good I can:
               Nor doe I looke for Siluer for my meede,
               When poore men want, if I can helpe their neede:
               For though thou raylst on me at the Beare garden,
               Rather then see thee hangd, Ide beg thy Pardon;
               Although it cost me more the suing forth
               In readie money then thy Boat is worth:
               So much I tender Man, though bred by Nature,
               As being Image of his high Creator:
               But thou that of mans Life art no esteemer,
               What mercie canst thou hope frō thy Redeemer.
               Say I had wrōgd thee, thou good-names betrayer,
               Thou call'st for Vengeance in thy Sauiors prayer:
               I will not say so, but it doth appeare,
               Thou scarce dost say thy prayers once a yeare:
               Thou must forgiue, if thou wouldst be forgiuen;
               For if thou fear'st not Hell, nere hope for Heauen.
               Thou dost accuse the King as well for Graunts
               As men for Sutes: But leaue these bitter taunts,
               And learne in time, blacke tayle of insolence,
               To arme thy heart with Christian patience.
               
                  Thus haue I answered all thy false Alarmes:
               Now it remaines for me to blaze thy Armes;
               For thou hast falsely set vp mine in blue;
               Wherefore I meane to haue a bowt with you.
               Thy Heraldrie shall not out-strip my braine,
               But Ile deuise as good for thee againe:
               And first; because all Sculls thou dost excell,
               A siluer Oare will for thy Crest doe well,
               A paire of Armes bound in a sable Scarffe,
               In a sad field, as large as Wapping Wharffe,
               Out of the water shall appeare one dead,
               A Halter and a crosse-barre ore his head;
               And on his Shield this Motto shall be found,
               Taylor the Sculler was both hangd and drownd.
               In all this blazing thee, no hurt I meane,
               But hang thee till the Tide haue washt thee clean:
               And when the billowes ore thy head are flowing,
               And AEolus 'gainst Neptunes brow is blowing,
               And Oares &amp; Sculs aboue thy crosse-barre sailing,
               There is great hope thou wilt forget thy rayling.
               Thus haue I answered thee in three dayes space,
               And yet my Penne ranne but an ampling pace:
               Thus much I mildly write, in hope 'twil mēd thee;
               If not, the Thames or Wapping shore wil end thee.
               And last, to shew what course I would direct thee,
               Vse honestie, from Tiborne to protect thee.
               
                  Thine more then thou desirest, 
                  Will: Fennor, his Maiesties Riming Poet.
                  
               
            
            
               
               To my kinde Friends in generall.
               NOw you haue read, and vnderstand my mind,
               I hope your wonted fauors I shall finde,
               In spight of rayling basenesse, whose lewd toungs
               Are Sathans Instruments for slanderous wrongs.
               Sure I haue satisfied your expectation,
               And vsde the Sculler in his owne vocation:
               But if you thinke my Answere ouer-milde.
               Know this; I would not haue my tongue defilde
               With such vnciuile tearmes, much lesse my Pen,
               Which now giues satisfaction to all men
               Of Truth; I will auouch, in spight of ill,
               My Answere was set vp in Taylors Bill
               Falsely, without my Knowledge or consent:
               Then was not that a cause sufficient,
               To giue my purpose suddaine alteration,
               When I was plai'd the Knaue with in that fashion.
               But though we could not then meet face to face,
               I hope my Penne hath followed him apace:
               If I be not deceiu'd, it hath out-stript him,
               And spight of all his rods in pisse, 'tath whipt him,
               And made his howling hollow voice to rore;
               Yet for your loues, Ile giue him one lash more.
            
            
               
               FENNORS finall Fare-ill to TAYLOR, With his blue Bitch and Cods bellie.
               BLadder of Enuie, one word more with you;
               I must hunt out your Bitch, of Azure hue:
               You that at Roterdam haue Spies to houer,
               And in Cods bellies transport Slanders ouer,
               And without Licence belcheth them abroad,
               'T were fit she should be searcht to see her Loan:
               For in her Head, her Bellie, and her Crookes,
               I doubt there wil be foūd some dangerous Books:
               For he that vndertooke this Worke for thee,
               Perhaps prints Romish Doctrine for a fee;
               Or Matters preiudiciall to the State;
               Or things Schismaticall, to breed debate.
               If it be found so; spight of your Reuenge,
               You and your Bitch may in a Halter swinge,
               And your Cods bellie starue for want of water:
               To you all three I doe commend this Satyre,
               And to my Countrey all my loue and skill,
               To roote out all such instruments of ill.
            
            FINIS.
